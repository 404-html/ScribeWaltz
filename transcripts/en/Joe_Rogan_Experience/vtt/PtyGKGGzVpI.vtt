<v Speaker 2>I haven't looked through the catalog </v>

48
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.510
<v Speaker 2>that you can like even though I'm a part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the company,</v>

49
00:02:10.511 --> 00:02:13.120
<v Speaker 2>I have not looked through the catalog </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Luca,</v>

50
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how I was flesh lighting with </v>

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.470
<v Speaker 2>Roseanne.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Barr's vagina.</v>

52
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:19.360
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet she would do it.</v>

53
00:02:19.361 --> 00:02:22.510
<v Speaker 2>Roseanne would probably do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bet Rosie O'donnell might do it too,</v>

54
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.180
<v Speaker 2>but there's a lot of lesbians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would do it just to throw someone's </v>

55
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.610
<v Speaker 2>out there using their vagina properly </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Rosie's,</v>

56
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.240
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to take two flashlights and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just rub them together.</v>

57
00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.280

<v Speaker 2>I don't remember if he said the front </v>

347
00:14:41.451 --> 00:14:41.451
<v Speaker 2>row,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he might've said that back row,</v>

348
00:14:41.451 --> 00:14:45.080
<v Speaker 2>whatever he said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were super obvious and they were </v>

349
00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:45.080
<v Speaker 2>standing there with their arms crossed </v>
<v Speaker 2>just staring at him the whole time.</v>

350
00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.170
<v Speaker 2>So He's trying not to cross any lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Try not to say anything.</v>

351
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:49.380
<v Speaker 2>The lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't cuss.</v>

352
00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:49.790
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

353
00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:53.540
<v Speaker 2>You can say they don't want you making </v>
<v Speaker 2>fun of Islam.</v>

354
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.730
<v Speaker 2>They don't remember when we had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's his face,</v>

355
00:14:56.090 --> 00:15:01.090
<v Speaker 2>how sparks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was talking about almost getting </v>

356
00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:03.101
<v Speaker 2>arrested who's doing gigs with Jon </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lovitz and he made the mistake of </v>

357
00:15:03.101 --> 00:15:05.140
<v Speaker 2>calling the speaking of the.</v>

358
00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:10.490
<v Speaker 2>One of the sultans or one of the shakes </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he called them.</v>

359
00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:12.860
<v Speaker 2>What do you call Ms Dot Moore?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ms Dot Moore.</v>

360
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:14.950
<v Speaker 2>Ms Dot Moore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he said that.</v>

361
00:15:14.951 --> 00:15:19.951
<v Speaker 2>I called them the French name for Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and apparently one guy got incredibly </v>

362
00:15:19.951 --> 00:15:22.390
<v Speaker 2>offended and called the religious police</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people showed up and they were going</v>

363
00:15:22.391 --> 00:15:23.660
<v Speaker 2>to fuck him and put them in jail for </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

364
00:15:23.690 --> 00:15:26.690
<v Speaker 2>I seriously think I could make a movie </v>
<v Speaker 2>about my weekend.</v>

365
00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:31.750
<v Speaker 2>The one weekend I went there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the risk area when there's other parts </v>

366
00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:32.160
<v Speaker 2>of the country where you travel like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that where the dues,</v>

367
00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:35.780
<v Speaker 2>we get used to behaving and thinking you</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a certain amount of freedom.</v>

368
00:15:35.781 --> 00:15:38.360
<v Speaker 2>You know what you do here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is an entirely free country.</v>

369
00:15:38.361 --> 00:15:39.560
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd still illegal.</v>

370
00:15:39.561 --> 00:15:42.050
<v Speaker 2>You can't say I want to kill the </v>
<v Speaker 2>president or if you do,</v>

371
00:15:42.051 --> 00:15:43.410
<v Speaker 2>they'll lock you up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

372
00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:48.610
<v Speaker 2>obviously it was in character when I </v>
<v Speaker 2>said that the president of the Kentucky </v>

373
00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:48.610
<v Speaker 2>Fried Chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

374
00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:49.310
<v Speaker 2>you can't do certain things.</v>

375
00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:51.470
<v Speaker 2>You can say it's not completely and </v>
<v Speaker 2>totally free,</v>

376
00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.930
<v Speaker 2>but for the most part it's pretty easy </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get along here.</v>

377
00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:55.490
<v Speaker 2>But if you go to other parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

378
00:15:55.491 --> 00:15:57.620
<v Speaker 2>they're incredibly suppressive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Incredible.</v>

379
00:15:57.650 --> 00:15:59.490
<v Speaker 2>Especially the Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Terrifying.</v>

380
00:15:59.570 --> 00:16:04.570
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the things like when </v>

381
00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:04.570
<v Speaker 2>people like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

382
00:16:04.570 --> 00:16:06.260
<v Speaker 2>I am most certainly not for war and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>into this war,</v>

383
00:16:06.261 --> 00:16:08.780
<v Speaker 2>which I think is a fucking shady war and</v>
<v Speaker 2>shady as fuck her.</v>

384
00:16:08.781 --> 00:16:13.781
<v Speaker 2>We got into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you have to be very careful about </v>

385
00:16:13.791 --> 00:16:16.460
<v Speaker 2>the rise of Islamic power all around the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

386
00:16:16.461 --> 00:16:20.150
<v Speaker 2>The rise of [inaudible] was sharia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sharia law.</v>

387
00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:22.580
<v Speaker 2>We have to be careful of any kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious zealots,</v>

388
00:16:22.581 --> 00:16:24.520
<v Speaker 2>whether Christian zealots are Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslims,</v>

389
00:16:24.521 --> 00:16:29.521
<v Speaker 2>ups or anytime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People that think they can lock you up </v>

390
00:16:29.521 --> 00:16:29.870
<v Speaker 2>and they have the right to because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were having fun,</v>

391
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:35.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were out dancing when you were out </v>

392
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:35.110
<v Speaker 2>drinking.</v>

393
00:16:35.110 --> 00:16:35.480
<v Speaker 2>I have to say that's some scary shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always been,</v>

394
00:16:35.540 --> 00:16:40.540
<v Speaker 2>not anti American,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I always rebel against the </v>

395
00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:41.600
<v Speaker 2>government on all things when I get over</v>
<v Speaker 2>there and this should happen.</v>

396
00:16:41.601 --> 00:16:44.600
<v Speaker 2>That's when you start to really </v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciate your country that you go,</v>

397
00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:49.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could call the embassy and they would </v>

398
00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:49.810
<v Speaker 2>take care like they fight for you at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>shore.</v>

399
00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:51.560
<v Speaker 2>That's what they're supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they're United States citizens,</v>

400
00:16:51.561 --> 00:16:52.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

401
00:16:52.251 --> 00:16:53.780
<v Speaker 2>we pay taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's all about.</v>

402
00:16:53.781 --> 00:16:58.781
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the benefits of being a part of </v>

403
00:16:58.781 --> 00:17:00.581
<v Speaker 2>the team,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just fucked up that we have to </v>

404
00:17:00.581 --> 00:17:00.581
<v Speaker 2>think about that anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

405
00:17:00.581 --> 00:17:00.581
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

406
00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:03.110
<v Speaker 2>it's not perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fuck corruptive shit,</v>

407
00:17:03.111 --> 00:17:04.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super corrupt.</v>

408
00:17:04.311 --> 00:17:07.310
<v Speaker 2>The fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the business of government is gigantic.</v>

409
00:17:07.311 --> 00:17:12.311
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a billion different jobs out </v>

410
00:17:12.311 --> 00:17:12.311
<v Speaker 2>there that are literally don't need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>exist.</v>

411
00:17:12.311 --> 00:17:15.960
<v Speaker 2>They exist to keep jobs going to keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>the business of government going and it </v>

412
00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:18.620
<v Speaker 2>creates quagmires and fucking complex </v>
<v Speaker 2>little social situations.</v>

413
00:17:18.621 --> 00:17:20.090
<v Speaker 2>That's very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I always say to people,</v>

414
00:17:20.091 --> 00:17:22.610
<v Speaker 2>I think it's funny when people criticize</v>
<v Speaker 2>the president.</v>

415
00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an Obama Fan,</v>

416
00:17:24.651 --> 00:17:29.651
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not against them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in the whole political </v>

417
00:17:29.651 --> 00:17:29.651
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I love people that criticize,</v>

418
00:17:29.651 --> 00:17:32.770
<v Speaker 2>but he's the one who's in charge now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fucked everything up.</v>

419
00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:35.710
<v Speaker 2>He's so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like ww raw,</v>

420
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:38.420
<v Speaker 2>that whole political system and Vince </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mcmahon's,</v>

421
00:17:38.421 --> 00:17:41.600
<v Speaker 2>the corporations running it all and.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

422
00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.010
<v Speaker 2>but people that criticize like a guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

423
00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:45.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Baldwin is healthcare Douglas.</v>

424
00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:46.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

425
00:17:46.341 --> 00:17:49.830
<v Speaker 2>you can't even fucking return your </v>
<v Speaker 2>videos to blockbuster on time.</v>

426
00:17:49.930 --> 00:17:50.110
<v Speaker 2>How</v>

427
00:17:50.610 --> 00:17:52.890
<v Speaker 4>it's a general lack of understanding of </v>
<v Speaker 4>what the system,</v>

428
00:17:52.891 --> 00:17:55.050
<v Speaker 4>which I think most people have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And even me,</v>

429
00:17:55.051 --> 00:17:55.680
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll,</v>

430
00:17:55.681 --> 00:18:00.681
<v Speaker 4>I'll get into it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll focus on for like a couple of </v>

431
00:18:00.681 --> 00:18:00.681
<v Speaker 4>months and then I'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what am I doing?</v>

432
00:18:00.681 --> 00:18:03.000
<v Speaker 4>What am I paying attention to on paying </v>
<v Speaker 4>attention to this stupid hustle,</v>

433
00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:06.210
<v Speaker 4>this fake thing that barely know what </v>
<v Speaker 4>goes on in Washington,</v>

434
00:18:06.211 --> 00:18:09.030
<v Speaker 4>barely affects your day to day life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What goes on in your neighborhood,</v>

435
00:18:09.031 --> 00:18:11.250
<v Speaker 4>what goes on with your friends?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It goes on in your world,</v>

436
00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.590
<v Speaker 4>the people that you interact with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's it affects your life.</v>

437
00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:18.800
<v Speaker 4>If you get really too hung up and </v>
<v Speaker 4>dealing with like Washington and </v>

438
00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.370
<v Speaker 4>politics and Democrats and Republicans </v>
<v Speaker 4>and and thinking.</v>

439
00:18:20.371 --> 00:18:22.880
<v Speaker 4>You understand that system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what's ridiculous.</v>

440
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:27.890
<v Speaker 4>Used to work for a senator and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was my first job where I worked for </v>

441
00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:27.890
<v Speaker 4>Ireland.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Specter,</v>

442
00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:29.820
<v Speaker 4>get the fuck out of here to God that </v>
<v Speaker 4>evil cunt.</v>

443
00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:31.410
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that guy was on the warrant commission.</v>

444
00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:32.900
<v Speaker 4>I can tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just,</v>

445
00:18:32.910 --> 00:18:37.910
<v Speaker 4>I started interning for him in college </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it was like I thought I wanted to go</v>

446
00:18:38.221 --> 00:18:40.590
<v Speaker 4>into politics or something and then I </v>
<v Speaker 4>realized like I'm the.</v>

447
00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:44.100
<v Speaker 4>I thought that I had the shady side that</v>
<v Speaker 4>was good for politics,</v>

448
00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:47.820
<v Speaker 4>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no fun involved.</v>

449
00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:52.850
<v Speaker 4>It's just a fucking torture is horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they are that like everyone says </v>

450
00:18:52.850 --> 00:18:55.440
<v Speaker 4>it's poor man's Hollywood specter had </v>
<v Speaker 4>like hair plugs,</v>

451
00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:57.930
<v Speaker 4>facelift,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking horse.</v>

452
00:18:57.931 --> 00:19:00.230
<v Speaker 4>You have to appear virile too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it was just like.</v>

453
00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:02.850
<v Speaker 4>And he was the ugliest dude in the world</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he was over evil.</v>

454
00:19:02.851 --> 00:19:05.280
<v Speaker 4>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when he would explain his,</v>

455
00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:10.330
<v Speaker 4>his single bullet theory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he would sit and explain it to you </v>

456
00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:10.330
<v Speaker 4>after he does it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would believe him?</v>

457
00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:10.330
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't.</v>

458
00:19:10.330 --> 00:19:12.270
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wouldn't because I've seen the bullet.</v>

459
00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:14.550
<v Speaker 4>The dumbest thing about the single </v>
<v Speaker 4>bullet is the bullet itself,</v>

460
00:19:14.551 --> 00:19:16.490
<v Speaker 4>but there's almost no damage went </v>
<v Speaker 4>through to people.</v>

461
00:19:16.491 --> 00:19:20.400
<v Speaker 4>Shattered bone and it's barely dentist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm telling you in his presence,</v>

462
00:19:20.401 --> 00:19:21.960
<v Speaker 4>he has this way of Cain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Correct.</v>

463
00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:27.380
<v Speaker 4>Incorrect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would not be amused or affected by </v>

464
00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:27.870
<v Speaker 4>that dummy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's no way that guy's an evil.</v>

465
00:19:27.871 --> 00:19:29.550
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way I would listen to him and</v>

466
00:19:29.551 --> 00:19:32.160
<v Speaker 4>being charming or is he not in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>least.</v>

467
00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:33.750
<v Speaker 4>It was one of those things where I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

468
00:19:33.751 --> 00:19:36.240
<v Speaker 4>how the fuck did this guy get into </v>
<v Speaker 4>politics?</v>

469
00:19:36.241 --> 00:19:40.050
<v Speaker 4>He was on her and all you have to do is </v>
<v Speaker 4>be in dude,</v>

470
00:19:40.051 --> 00:19:42.210
<v Speaker 4>once you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like being a writer on a Sitcom.</v>

471
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:47.480
<v Speaker 4>You know when you work on a Sitcom,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the things you find out about </v>

472
00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:49.791
<v Speaker 4>working on sitcoms is there's usually a </v>
<v Speaker 4>few brilliant writers and these fucking </v>

473
00:19:49.791 --> 00:19:49.791
<v Speaker 4>fakes.</v>

474
00:19:49.791 --> 00:19:51.990
<v Speaker 4>These people that aren't really funny at</v>
<v Speaker 4>all,</v>

475
00:19:51.991 --> 00:19:56.991
<v Speaker 4>like they would never stand up comedian </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone somehow or another got them a </v>

476
00:19:56.991 --> 00:20:00.270
<v Speaker 4>job as a comedy writer and now here they</v>
<v Speaker 4>are on sitcoms and I would you deal with</v>

477
00:20:00.271 --> 00:20:05.271
<v Speaker 4>them over and over and over again and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you realize all you have to do is just </v>

478
00:20:05.271 --> 00:20:05.271
<v Speaker 4>get into the system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once you get into the system,</v>

479
00:20:05.271 --> 00:20:07.140
<v Speaker 4>then you get other jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I gave that speech once.</v>

480
00:20:07.150 --> 00:20:12.150
<v Speaker 4>I got a deal a long time ago with a for </v>
<v Speaker 4>to do a sitcom and it was going to be </v>

481
00:20:12.150 --> 00:20:16.251
<v Speaker 4>about my life and I used to live with my</v>
<v Speaker 4>sister in New York for awhile and they </v>

482
00:20:16.251 --> 00:20:16.251
<v Speaker 4>thought that was funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

483
00:20:16.251 --> 00:20:17.130
<v Speaker 4>to the point of view will make a show </v>
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>

484
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:22.630
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I met with writers or first I met </v>

485
00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:23.820
<v Speaker 4>with the all the development guys and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they were like showing me the writers.</v>

486
00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:26.210
<v Speaker 4>They were gonna give me and they gave me</v>
<v Speaker 4>the script of these guys and I went,</v>

<v Speaker 4>this is shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is shit.</v>

488
00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:31.230
<v Speaker 4>And my manager at the time was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shut the fuck up,</v>

489
00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:32.610
<v Speaker 4>take the money.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Carry Hoffman had in New York.</v>

<v Speaker 4>He owned standup New York.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

492
00:20:38.401 --> 00:20:40.140
<v Speaker 4>Stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>New York didn't carry,</v>

493
00:20:40.141 --> 00:20:45.141
<v Speaker 4>like he would get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like people would get sitcoms and he </v>

494
00:20:45.141 --> 00:20:45.141
<v Speaker 4>would want a piece of the Sitcom because</v>
<v Speaker 4>they used to work out in this club.</v>

<v Speaker 2>stouffer's or listen to that guy was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>manager of a fucking calm or owned a </v>

<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm sorry.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm sitting in the meeting.</v>

508
00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:17.650
<v Speaker 2>No offense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

509
00:21:17.651 --> 00:21:22.651
<v Speaker 2>I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that you think these guys are </v>

510
00:21:22.651 --> 00:21:22.651
<v Speaker 2>good writers and everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

511
00:21:22.651 --> 00:21:22.900
<v Speaker 2>but I know this whole system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what goes on,</v>

512
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:26.120
<v Speaker 2>guys get in and they'd get their buddy </v>
<v Speaker 2>in and he can't write and.</v>

513
00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:31.170
<v Speaker 2>But then they've been there for 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you don't realize they never wrote </v>

514
00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:31.170
<v Speaker 2>anything good.</v>

515
00:21:31.170 --> 00:21:32.020
<v Speaker 2>They were just there and now they get to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a show runner.</v>

516
00:21:32.021 --> 00:21:37.021
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got millions of friends that write </v>

517
00:21:37.021 --> 00:21:37.021
<v Speaker 2>funnier than this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I?</v>

518
00:21:37.021 --> 00:21:38.010
<v Speaker 2>Can I just go out and get one of them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we're.</v>

519
00:21:38.050 --> 00:21:43.050
<v Speaker 2>Jim and I are in that situation right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now where they're trying to do a show </v>

520
00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:44.680
<v Speaker 2>with us right now and it's like we feel </v>
<v Speaker 2>like we,</v>

521
00:21:44.690 --> 00:21:45.880
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could write the show.</v>

522
00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:46.820
<v Speaker 2>There was a time when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

523
00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:49.000
<v Speaker 2>I had a development deal where there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>two guys that were,</v>

524
00:21:49.001 --> 00:21:49.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

525
00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:54.780
<v Speaker 2>writing for friends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were the creators of friends and </v>

526
00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:54.780
<v Speaker 2>one of them branched out on his own and </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

527
00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:57.450
<v Speaker 2>I got this development deal and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>for Fox and was,</v>

528
00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.280
<v Speaker 2>it was a good amount of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they really wanted this guy to do</v>

529
00:22:00.281 --> 00:22:02.740
<v Speaker 2>it because this guy has such as great </v>
<v Speaker 2>background will.</v>

530
00:22:02.741 --> 00:22:05.200
<v Speaker 2>Often what happens is when there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>team of writers,</v>

531
00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:08.270
<v Speaker 2>you got one brilliant guy and the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>

532
00:22:08.271 --> 00:22:10.980
<v Speaker 2>this fucking buddy that you bounce shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>off of,</v>

533
00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:11.910
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

534
00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:16.920
<v Speaker 2>And so the brilliant guys bouncing shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>off the other guy and then they put it </v>

535
00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:17.860
<v Speaker 2>all together like maybe the other guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>types and they become a team.</v>

536
00:22:17.890 --> 00:22:22.890
<v Speaker 2>So you didn't want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somewhere along the line the other guy </v>

537
00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:22.890
<v Speaker 2>says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

538
00:22:22.890 --> 00:22:25.180
<v Speaker 2>I think I'm unrecognized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My talent from a much broader.</v>

539
00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:27.430
<v Speaker 2>So this fucking idiot decides he's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go out on his own.</v>

540
00:22:27.431 --> 00:22:30.590
<v Speaker 2>So he gets his giant development deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was for um,</v>

541
00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:35.950
<v Speaker 2>it was Michael Eisner's company and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a fucking huge development deal.</v>

542
00:22:35.951 --> 00:22:38.110
<v Speaker 2>Millions and millions of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody was like banking on this guy.</v>

543
00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:40.210
<v Speaker 2>And so I go to meet with the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted me to meet with them.</v>

544
00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:43.300
<v Speaker 2>I meet with them and he's wearing </v>
<v Speaker 2>bowling shoes.</v>

545
00:22:43.530 --> 00:22:45.730
<v Speaker 2>And whenever I see a guy who was trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be wacky,</v>

546
00:22:45.970 --> 00:22:50.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're wearing bone bone shoes aren't </v>

547
00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:50.970
<v Speaker 2>comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are uncomfortable as fuck.</v>

548
00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:52.870
<v Speaker 2>Like why you wearing those and wearing </v>
<v Speaker 2>those to let me know that you're nutty.</v>

549
00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:54.850
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might be a multimillionaire,</v>

550
00:22:54.851 --> 00:22:58.170
<v Speaker 2>but I were bowling shoes to the office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you just get done bowling?</v>

551
00:22:58.200 --> 00:22:59.590
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're trying to send a message.</v>

552
00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:03.010
<v Speaker 2>The message is you're dressing like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think a funny person would dress.</v>

553
00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:05.530
<v Speaker 2>That tells me you're probably not </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking funny.</v>

554
00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:07.390
<v Speaker 2>So I immediately get terrified and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

555
00:23:07.391 --> 00:23:09.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy is a fucking faker.</v>

556
00:23:09.821 --> 00:23:12.010
<v Speaker 2>He snuck through and there's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way.</v>

557
00:23:12.040 --> 00:23:17.040
<v Speaker 2>How can you get this fucking gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 2>multi-multi million dollar dear if you </v>

558
00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:17.040
<v Speaker 2>snuck through?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I meet with the guy,</v>

559
00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.010
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talk,</v>

560
00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.630
<v Speaker 2>he has an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants me to be a part of it.</v>

561
00:23:20.631 --> 00:23:23.050
<v Speaker 2>And Bubba Bubba,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we meet and then they give me one of the</v>

562
00:23:23.051 --> 00:23:28.051
<v Speaker 2>scripts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The script that I read is fucking </v>

563
00:23:28.051 --> 00:23:28.051
<v Speaker 2>terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

564
00:23:28.051 --> 00:23:28.270
<v Speaker 2>it was just God awful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing funny in there at all.</v>

565
00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:28.960
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

566
00:23:28.961 --> 00:23:30.150
<v Speaker 2>maybe this is just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

567
00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:32.050
<v Speaker 2>just a shit script.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he's got some other ones,</v>

568
00:23:32.051 --> 00:23:34.420
<v Speaker 2>maybe there's a Spec,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe they had him write this,</v>

569
00:23:34.421 --> 00:23:39.421
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it wasn't a subject that he was </v>

570
00:23:39.421 --> 00:23:39.421
<v Speaker 2>interested in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this guy comes up with the,</v>

571
00:23:39.421 --> 00:23:39.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is this idea for a sitcom.</v>

572
00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:43.870
<v Speaker 2>Sitcom is about an immortal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about a man who's immortal.</v>

573
00:23:44.050 --> 00:23:45.350
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

575
00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:50.510
<v Speaker 4>existence like Egyptian days and all he </v>
<v Speaker 4>does is like get laid.</v>

576
00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:57.560
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking devoid of comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who wants to watch a sitcom about an </v>

577
00:23:58.521 --> 00:24:03.521
<v Speaker 4>immortal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a guy who was in mortal has been a more </v>

578
00:24:03.521 --> 00:24:03.521
<v Speaker 4>general sense the Egyptian days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And all he does is try to get.</v>

579
00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:08.530
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand all these hooks and </v>
<v Speaker 4>these sitcoms when you look at like the </v>

580
00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:10.960
<v Speaker 4>best sitcoms that have ever existed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the jobs or whatever they do it.</v>

581
00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:13.770
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's so like superifilous.</v>

582
00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:18.780
<v Speaker 4>It's all you need is a group of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that hang out together and have </v>

583
00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:20.540
<v Speaker 4>relationships with each other and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting relationships.</v>

584
00:24:20.541 --> 00:24:25.010
<v Speaker 4>If you look at like taxi and cheers and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you could move them to any other setting</v>

585
00:24:25.011 --> 00:24:30.011
<v Speaker 4>and they would be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You put them in an office if you didn't </v>

586
00:24:30.011 --> 00:24:30.180
<v Speaker 4>matter what this guy did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

587
00:24:30.181 --> 00:24:35.181
<v Speaker 4>this guy was not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter if he wrote about </v>

588
00:24:35.181 --> 00:24:37.991
<v Speaker 4>three people hanging out at a laundromat</v>
<v Speaker 4>or three people who work on the moon </v>

589
00:24:37.991 --> 00:24:37.991
<v Speaker 4>just in that.</v>

590
00:24:37.991 --> 00:24:38.540
<v Speaker 4>He's a fucking idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just snuck in.</v>

591
00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:39.950
<v Speaker 4>That show never made it out though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

592
00:24:39.980 --> 00:24:40.970
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course it didn't.</v>

593
00:24:40.971 --> 00:24:45.971
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had to tell them we had a meeting and </v>

594
00:24:45.971 --> 00:24:48.020
<v Speaker 4>it was a real controversial meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like they were upset at me </v>

595
00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:48.020
<v Speaker 4>because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy sucks,</v>

596
00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:48.230
<v Speaker 4>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy does not suck.</v>

597
00:24:48.350 --> 00:24:50.090
<v Speaker 4>This guy is Bubba Bubba.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's this,</v>

598
00:24:50.091 --> 00:24:52.190
<v Speaker 4>he's that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's done all these things and I'm like,</v>

599
00:24:52.191 --> 00:24:53.330
<v Speaker 4>he's not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm telling you,</v>

600
00:24:53.331 --> 00:24:54.800
<v Speaker 4>this guy is not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a mistake.</v>

601
00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:59.910
<v Speaker 4>They'll like you don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's more to writing and just being </v>

602
00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:03.041
<v Speaker 4>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's character development and story </v>

603
00:25:03.041 --> 00:25:05.291
<v Speaker 4>arts and he's a guy who really </v>
<v Speaker 4>understands that and we can bring in </v>

604
00:25:05.291 --> 00:25:08.981
<v Speaker 4>more funny later,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what he's really concerned with is </v>

605
00:25:08.981 --> 00:25:08.981
<v Speaker 4>what we're concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We want a really good story.</v>

606
00:25:08.981 --> 00:25:10.220
<v Speaker 4>The story was deaf.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was terrible.</v>

607
00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:11.960
<v Speaker 4>It was stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It didn't make any sense.</v>

608
00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:17.110
<v Speaker 4>It was just like a guy who's pretending </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be a comedy writer who got a job </v>

609
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.440
<v Speaker 4>writing comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like if you took some fucking guy,</v>

610
00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:22.450
<v Speaker 4>worked for a fence company and I was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm tired of renting Francis other </v>

611
00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:23.180
<v Speaker 4>organ.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I'm a good writer.</v>

612
00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:26.210
<v Speaker 4>I've done it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been doing standup for 15 years and</v>

613
00:25:26.270 --> 00:25:27.010
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It only,</v>

614
00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:32.060
<v Speaker 4>it took me 15,</v>
<v Speaker 4>14 and about 14 and a half years to </v>

615
00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:35.501
<v Speaker 4>finally realize that 95 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people in the business don't know </v>

616
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:37.010
<v Speaker 4>anything about comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

617
00:25:37.011 --> 00:25:39.020
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't really truly understand unless</v>

618
00:25:39.021 --> 00:25:40.580
<v Speaker 4>you're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

619
00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:44.210
<v Speaker 4>I and I've lately been putting them to </v>
<v Speaker 4>the test where I'll say,</v>

620
00:25:44.211 --> 00:25:47.180
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>explain to me why and when you put them,</v>

621
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:50.840
<v Speaker 4>like when you put them on the hotspot </v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore or like I'll say something like,</v>

622
00:25:50.841 --> 00:25:52.220
<v Speaker 4>why is that comic doing that?</v>

623
00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:57.220
<v Speaker 4>Or why should he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why do you think he's good at what he </v>

624
00:25:57.220 --> 00:25:57.220
<v Speaker 4>does?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or why isn't he,</v>

625
00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:00.770
<v Speaker 4>you asking agents,</v>
<v Speaker 4>managers with development people,</v>

626
00:26:00.771 --> 00:26:05.771
<v Speaker 4>talent scouts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always do it and I put them to it and </v>

627
00:26:05.771 --> 00:26:05.771
<v Speaker 4>they'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

628
00:26:05.771 --> 00:26:09.071
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he does this really interesting thing </v>

629
00:26:09.071 --> 00:26:09.890
<v Speaker 4>where he's kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not really observational,</v>

630
00:26:09.891 --> 00:26:13.390
<v Speaker 4>but he's kind of political buddies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's more on a surreal.</v>

631
00:26:13.450 --> 00:26:15.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have no fucking idea.</v>

632
00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:18.980
<v Speaker 4>You have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You all are sheep and you just file.</v>

633
00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000
<v Speaker 4>It's not that I don't think they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think agents and managers are really </v>

634
00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.371
<v Speaker 4>important,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think they really can't truly </v>

635
00:26:27.371 --> 00:26:27.371
<v Speaker 4>understand what common is all about </v>
<v Speaker 4>unless they do it.</v>

636
00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:28.580
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unless you do it,</v>

637
00:26:28.581 --> 00:26:30.590
<v Speaker 4>you really never going to be an expert </v>
<v Speaker 4>on it.</v>

638
00:26:30.591 --> 00:26:35.591
<v Speaker 4>You might know a lot about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're never going to really truly </v>

639
00:26:35.591 --> 00:26:35.591
<v Speaker 4>understand it unless you can recreate </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

640
00:26:35.591 --> 00:26:37.340
<v Speaker 4>I have an agent out of Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you might have.</v>

641
00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:39.700
<v Speaker 4>I think he might've worked with you when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were down there already,</v>

642
00:26:39.701 --> 00:26:40.820
<v Speaker 4>Lang.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

643
00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:43.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Same name as the Howard's Guy,</v>

644
00:26:43.681 --> 00:26:44.100
<v Speaker 4>but st</v>

645
00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:48.000
<v Speaker 2>already is fucking like the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 2>agent that has been a great guy.</v>

646
00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:52.380
<v Speaker 2>He's fucking amazing and he knows comedy</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedy a little bit and like you'll do a</v>

647
00:26:52.381 --> 00:26:53.850
<v Speaker 2>bit and he'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you say this?</v>

648
00:26:53.851 --> 00:26:55.080
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

649
00:26:55.081 --> 00:26:57.720
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would actually work better and I'll</v>

650
00:26:57.721 --> 00:27:00.150
<v Speaker 2>run my sets by him before I go on TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

651
00:27:00.151 --> 00:27:00.460
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

652
00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:03.090
<v Speaker 2>Take that out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put that in any shit.</v>

653
00:27:03.091 --> 00:27:08.091
<v Speaker 2>We're not saying that he can have some </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding of comedy without doing </v>

654
00:27:08.091 --> 00:27:10.641
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just can't really truly understand </v>

655
00:27:10.641 --> 00:27:10.641
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

656
00:27:10.641 --> 00:27:10.641
<v Speaker 2>You're never gonna understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way it comic understands it.</v>

657
00:27:10.641 --> 00:27:12.240
<v Speaker 2>It's all theoretical until you put it in</v>
<v Speaker 2>practice.</v>

658
00:27:12.241 --> 00:27:15.010
<v Speaker 2>It's like a guy who does caught it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the gym is pretty sure he could farewell</v>

659
00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:15.920
<v Speaker 2>in a street fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

660
00:27:15.921 --> 00:27:16.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

661
00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:18.690
<v Speaker 2>but really he's not really sure it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>theoretical.</v>

662
00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:20.820
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy who was actually fought a bunch of</v>

663
00:27:20.821 --> 00:27:21.480
<v Speaker 2>times was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

664
00:27:21.481 --> 00:27:22.410
<v Speaker 2>I've been through this shit before.</v>

665
00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:23.820
<v Speaker 2>I know what I'm going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

666
00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:25.860
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a difference and,</v>

667
00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:30.870
<v Speaker 2>but there's nothing wrong with agents </v>
<v Speaker 2>and managers that don't understand it </v>

668
00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:31.530
<v Speaker 2>totally because they do a great job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

669
00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:36.920
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't do it and you wouldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to sell ourselves or </v>

670
00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:36.920
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to go out and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>development deals.</v>

671
00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:38.940
<v Speaker 2>We can't do it anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't negotiate for yourself.</v>

672
00:27:38.941 --> 00:27:43.941
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially that end be creative like </v>

673
00:27:43.941 --> 00:27:43.950
<v Speaker 2>it's important to have managers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>agents,</v>

674
00:27:43.951 --> 00:27:46.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't have to know everything.</v>

675
00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:49.440
<v Speaker 2>They just have to shut the fuck up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>push in the right direction.</v>

676
00:27:49.441 --> 00:27:51.960
<v Speaker 2>If you're talented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what the problem is when you're</v>

677
00:27:51.961 --> 00:27:54.390
<v Speaker 2>not that talented or when you're not </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that,</v>

678
00:27:54.391 --> 00:27:56.160
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you haven't become successful yet.</v>

679
00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:58.380
<v Speaker 2>Then they start tweaking you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they start,</v>

680
00:27:58.381 --> 00:28:03.381
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got to figure out what's going on </v>

681
00:28:03.381 --> 00:28:03.381
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

682
00:28:03.381 --> 00:28:03.381
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need as a new look.</v>

683
00:28:03.381 --> 00:28:06.440
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Jamie Masada told my friend Todd </v>

684
00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:06.440
<v Speaker 2>Parker that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

685
00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.740
<v Speaker 2>he had to be the generation x guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what he was saying by the younger</v>

686
00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:10.350
<v Speaker 2>generation x guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is your new hook.</v>

687
00:28:10.351 --> 00:28:15.351
<v Speaker 2>You go on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything come out of your mouth that </v>

688
00:28:15.351 --> 00:28:15.480
<v Speaker 2>gen x,</v>

691
00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:24.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember his name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've met a couple of those guys.</v>

692
00:28:24.571 --> 00:28:29.571
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wrote something with one of those </v>

693
00:28:29.571 --> 00:28:29.571
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy who wrote on Seinfeld.</v>

694
00:28:29.571 --> 00:28:33.320
<v Speaker 2>It was fucking terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't write anything funny and </v>

695
00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:33.630
<v Speaker 2>wound up meeting me writing the funny </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff and him writing it down.</v>

696
00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:36.330
<v Speaker 2>It was a terrible relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Carrie Hoffman.</v>

697
00:28:36.331 --> 00:28:39.420
<v Speaker 2>Did that to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me that once he tried to change me,</v>

698
00:28:39.421 --> 00:28:40.420
<v Speaker 2>it's like I could have no idea.</v>

699
00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:43.920
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you never see comedy duos anymore.</v>

700
00:28:44.230 --> 00:28:48.380
<v Speaker 2>You and a girl and a girl and you'd do </v>
<v Speaker 2>like stiller in Mira.</v>

701
00:28:48.510 --> 00:28:51.180
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

702
00:28:51.181 --> 00:28:52.340
<v Speaker 2>What an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

703
00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:57.590
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that guy still in the </v>

704
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:59.001
<v Speaker 2>business?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think actually he's doing really well </v>

705
00:28:59.001 --> 00:29:01.980
<v Speaker 2>because he's got Mike Royce and Tom hurt</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a really good writers and I think,</v>

706
00:29:02.370 --> 00:29:06.330
<v Speaker 2>I think tom might be on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always liked the guy I'm doing.</v>

707
00:29:06.331 --> 00:29:07.820
<v Speaker 2>This club is always nice to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tom,</v>

708
00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:10.170
<v Speaker 2>I heard that shit about him to 15 </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent from.</v>

709
00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:11.950
<v Speaker 2>He was kind of like a father to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was that.</v>

710
00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.620
<v Speaker 2>He was really good and he actually did </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

711
00:29:13.621 --> 00:29:18.621
<v Speaker 2>That was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of the shit he did was the best </v>

712
00:29:18.621 --> 00:29:19.110
<v Speaker 2>stuff a manager ever did for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I went to Montreal to do new faces,</v>

713
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:24.350
<v Speaker 2>he sent a tape of me to every single </v>
<v Speaker 2>person that wasn't going to Montreal and</v>

714
00:29:24.811 --> 00:29:29.811
<v Speaker 2>I bombed at Montreal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bombed and so I was fucked and then all </v>

715
00:29:30.031 --> 00:29:31.920
<v Speaker 2>the people that didn't go to Montreal </v>
<v Speaker 2>saw a tape.</v>

716
00:29:31.921 --> 00:29:33.860
<v Speaker 2>That was great and we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's all.</v>

717
00:29:33.890 --> 00:29:36.330
<v Speaker 2>What year was this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is 2000 or so.</v>

718
00:29:36.331 --> 00:29:38.130
<v Speaker 2>People were stopping and going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Montreal.</v>

723
00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:50.260
<v Speaker 5>A Dean Edwards who got Saturday night </v>

724
00:29:50.261 --> 00:29:52.360
<v Speaker 5>Demitri Martin,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mike Birbiglia,</v>

725
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:57.750
<v Speaker 5>a Russman,</v>

<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

727
00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:01.720
<v Speaker 5>and it was like the last year though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was the last year because chicken was</v>

728
00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:03.360
<v Speaker 2>the year before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

729
00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:05.740
<v Speaker 2>that was when I was going to bring up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we're talking about this,</v>

730
00:30:05.741 --> 00:30:07.500
<v Speaker 2>I think we brought up chicken on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast before,</v>

731
00:30:07.510 --> 00:30:09.000
<v Speaker 2>didn't we?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

732
00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:14.100
<v Speaker 2>chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God rest his soul is the most amazing </v>

733
00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:16.861
<v Speaker 2>phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is the proof that agents and </v>

734
00:30:16.861 --> 00:30:16.861
<v Speaker 2>managers have no fucking idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just don't get it.</v>

735
00:30:16.861 --> 00:30:17.620
<v Speaker 2>They don't know what's funny and what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not funny.</v>

736
00:30:17.980 --> 00:30:19.240
<v Speaker 2>This was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them don't.</v>

737
00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:21.230
<v Speaker 2>I should say this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

738
00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:25.990
<v Speaker 2>he was this young kid who was just real </v>
<v Speaker 2>boyishly handsome and he had this really</v>

739
00:30:25.991 --> 00:30:29.110
<v Speaker 2>wacky act like there was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a screw loose in them and he had</v>

740
00:30:29.111 --> 00:30:31.910
<v Speaker 2>this like really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like completely over the top act.</v>

741
00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:34.330
<v Speaker 2>It just would baffle comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we'll go.</v>

742
00:30:34.331 --> 00:30:36.570
<v Speaker 2>This is not funny at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't get it too.</v>

743
00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:38.180
<v Speaker 2>It was all like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>give you one.</v>

744
00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:38.740
<v Speaker 2>I remember</v>

745
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:40.660
<v Speaker 5>I auditioned for snl with them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He,</v>

746
00:30:40.661 --> 00:30:45.661
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he went on stage and said so and so when</v>

747
00:30:46.271 --> 00:30:47.500
<v Speaker 5>they hit a home run,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you ever see him?</v>

748
00:30:47.501 --> 00:30:50.050
<v Speaker 5>They just jog around the bases.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's like,</v>

749
00:30:50.051 --> 00:30:52.390
<v Speaker 5>they just casually jog around.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If they hit a home run,</v>

750
00:30:52.391 --> 00:30:53.410
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was me.</v>

751
00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:56.790
<v Speaker 5>If I hit a home run,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it'd be like what the fuck?</v>

752
00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:02.400
<v Speaker 5>And he'd like do like flips on stage and</v>
<v Speaker 5>run around the audience and like throw </v>

753
00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:06.431
<v Speaker 5>his arms in the air and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd be flicking shit in the air out of </v>

754
00:31:06.431 --> 00:31:09.571
<v Speaker 5>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Would almost like if you just see a </v>

755
00:31:09.571 --> 00:31:11.250
<v Speaker 5>crazy man jumping up and down in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>nightclub,</v>

756
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:13.390
<v Speaker 5>a dude's pretty crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what he was.</v>

757
00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:14.670
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

758
00:31:14.671 --> 00:31:16.500
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't that talented.</v>

759
00:31:16.530 --> 00:31:21.530
<v Speaker 2>We tried really hard anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wound up getting this giant </v>

760
00:31:21.530 --> 00:31:23.901
<v Speaker 2>development deal and just being a </v>
<v Speaker 2>complete total bust like they couldn't </v>

761
00:31:23.901 --> 00:31:25.440
<v Speaker 2>do anything with was just not talented.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just awful.</v>

762
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:30.590
<v Speaker 2>And so um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he went into this sort of dark </v>

763
00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:32.230
<v Speaker 2>depression and then comics hated them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he was a punchline for Comedians,</v>

764
00:31:32.490 --> 00:31:34.410
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of them who just shit all over </v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

765
00:31:34.670 --> 00:31:35.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

766
00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:35.610
<v Speaker 2>come,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

767
00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:40.620
<v Speaker 2>comics are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if one guy's doing better than you and </v>

768
00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:40.910
<v Speaker 2>you think he's not as good as you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just fucking phantom is the.</v>

769
00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:44.400
<v Speaker 2>So this kid one up killing himself in </v>
<v Speaker 2>front of a school.</v>

770
00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:46.750
<v Speaker 2>We hung himself on a tree in front of </v>
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>

771
00:31:46.890 --> 00:31:49.250
<v Speaker 5>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know that.</v>

772
00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:54.400
<v Speaker 5>I'm pretty sure that part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know I heard the story when he was at </v>

773
00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:58.061
<v Speaker 5>Montreal though,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like there was so much hype on them </v>

774
00:31:58.061 --> 00:32:00.731
<v Speaker 5>going into Montreal that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that they were bidding on him </v>

775
00:32:00.731 --> 00:32:05.291
<v Speaker 5>before he even went on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I think he did as he was going on </v>

776
00:32:05.291 --> 00:32:05.480
<v Speaker 5>stage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>someone said to his manager,</v>

777
00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:07.370
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the networks goes like,</v>

778
00:32:07.371 --> 00:32:12.371
<v Speaker 5>we'll give you a million dollars if he </v>
<v Speaker 5>doesn't step on that stage because they </v>

779
00:32:12.371 --> 00:32:14.940
<v Speaker 5>knew his price would even go up once he </v>
<v Speaker 5>went on stage and a million dollars.</v>

780
00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:17.390
<v Speaker 5>His development deal was a half a </v>
<v Speaker 5>million.</v>

781
00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:18.890
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was pretty sure that's what he got.</v>

782
00:32:18.891 --> 00:32:20.720
<v Speaker 5>So they said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll give you half a million for lease.</v>

783
00:32:20.730 --> 00:32:24.740
<v Speaker 5>That's what the rumor was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go on stage because they didn't want the</v>

784
00:32:24.741 --> 00:32:26.850
<v Speaker 5>bidding to even go up further.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I don't say</v>

785
00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:28.540
<v Speaker 2>lot of hype.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

786
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:31.030
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that really happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't really.</v>

787
00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:36.060
<v Speaker 2>Nobody does that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there was a lot of people that were </v>

788
00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:36.060
<v Speaker 2>into this kid and comics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd be standing in the back of the room</v>

789
00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:39.320
<v Speaker 2>watching this kid who flail around on </v>
<v Speaker 2>stage and you know,</v>

790
00:32:39.321 --> 00:32:40.670
<v Speaker 2>like literally flail,</v>

791
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and like he was on fire and go,</v>

792
00:32:43.131 --> 00:32:45.830
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's look at clips of him online.</v>

793
00:32:45.831 --> 00:32:48.530
<v Speaker 4>You think that's a good question?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Michael Ruth was his name.</v>

794
00:32:48.531 --> 00:32:51.320
<v Speaker 4>I think I've met him the night we did </v>
<v Speaker 4>snl.</v>

795
00:32:51.510 --> 00:32:56.510
<v Speaker 4>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were auditioning at Carolina and </v>

796
00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:58.991

<v Speaker 4>into the green room and all the comics </v>

797
00:32:58.991 --> 00:33:01.811
<v Speaker 4>kind of know each other and then he </v>
<v Speaker 4>shows up in the green room and he's got </v>

798
00:33:01.811 --> 00:33:03.170
<v Speaker 4>this energy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know those energy vampires that just</v>

799
00:33:03.350 --> 00:33:05.390

<v Speaker 4>else.</v>

800
00:33:05.630 --> 00:33:10.100
<v Speaker 4>He started bouncing around the room </v>
<v Speaker 4>going fucking crazy.</v>

801
00:33:10.101 --> 00:33:11.990
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what I'm fucking doing </v>

<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>

821
00:33:54.291 --> 00:33:55.700
<v Speaker 4>I've found some videos if you want to </v>

851
00:35:51.180 --> 00:35:56.180
<v Speaker 8>Funny,</v>

852
00:35:56.180 --> 00:35:57.000
<v Speaker 8>first time he had taken his underwear </v>
<v Speaker 8>and I gave himself a Wedgie so it looked</v>

853
00:35:57.001 --> 00:35:59.620
<v Speaker 8>like he had a thong on.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It was like a little touch,</v>

854
00:35:59.621 --> 00:36:01.800
<v Speaker 8>a little extra touch.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It was nice</v>

855
00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:04.510
<v Speaker 2>jazzed up the bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like the Tagline,</v>

856
00:36:04.511 --> 00:36:07.570
<v Speaker 2>the new crack tagline you added,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

857
00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:09.010
<v Speaker 2>whatever man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing wrong with that.</v>

858
00:36:09.220 --> 00:36:14.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not my style so I'm not </v>

859
00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:15.700
<v Speaker 2>into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was in closing down really well.</v>

860
00:36:15.701 --> 00:36:16.260
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

861
00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:16.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

862
00:36:16.930 --> 00:36:19.510
<v Speaker 2>he had that big development deal and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then nothing happened for it.</v>

863
00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:20.390
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

864
00:36:20.410 --> 00:36:21.550
<v Speaker 2>I remember like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

865
00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:24.220
<v Speaker 2>so many people are so fucking happy when</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing happened to it,</v>

866
00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:29.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's when it got really ugly for </v>

867
00:36:29.530 --> 00:36:31.241
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like comics were happy that he was </v>

868
00:36:31.241 --> 00:36:31.241
<v Speaker 2>failing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

869
00:36:31.241 --> 00:36:33.870
<v Speaker 2>and then we'll just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was like a lot of negative energy </v>

870
00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:33.870
<v Speaker 2>towards it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they used him as an example.</v>

871
00:36:33.870 --> 00:36:34.840
<v Speaker 2>They said like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he killed the development.</v>

872
00:36:34.841 --> 00:36:36.730
<v Speaker 2>Yes he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did kill it.</v>

873
00:36:37.090 --> 00:36:40.900
<v Speaker 2>They gave him a ton of money and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was it really killed.</v>

874
00:36:40.901 --> 00:36:45.460
<v Speaker 2>It was their lack of real talent and </v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to recognize talent,</v>

875
00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:46.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

876
00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:48.970
<v Speaker 2>these comics or these agents and </v>
<v Speaker 2>managers,</v>

877
00:36:48.971 --> 00:36:51.850
<v Speaker 2>they're really just taking guesses and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what killed that were killed.</v>

878
00:36:51.850 --> 00:36:56.850
<v Speaker 2>It was all these big people that spend a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of money and the people that were </v>

879
00:36:56.850 --> 00:36:56.850
<v Speaker 2>the head of studios that people that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

880
00:36:56.850 --> 00:37:00.810
<v Speaker 2>they had a budget and then they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why did we spend half a million dollars </v>

881
00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:00.810
<v Speaker 2>on this fucking thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

882
00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:02.470
<v Speaker 2>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of that going on,</v>

883
00:37:02.471 --> 00:37:03.220
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

884
00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:05.500
<v Speaker 2>like this the friends guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they sat that guy down.</v>

885
00:37:05.501 --> 00:37:07.360
<v Speaker 2>So just write us a couple of scripture </v>
<v Speaker 2>real quick.</v>

886
00:37:07.750 --> 00:37:10.000
<v Speaker 2>Now let's look at your scripts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at your scripts.</v>

887
00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:15.060
<v Speaker 2>They read their scripts and then didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>read anything from this guy before he </v>

888
00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:15.060
<v Speaker 2>got this deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know they didn't.</v>

889
00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:16.780
<v Speaker 2>I know the whole story behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody was so high on them.</v>

890
00:37:16.810 --> 00:37:19.180
<v Speaker 2>They just want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're willing to throw this guy money.</v>

891
00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:21.430
<v Speaker 2>I've looked at a bunch of scripts lately</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>

892
00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:22.210
<v Speaker 2>death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>death,</v>

893
00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:24.040
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do it.</v>

894
00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:24.700
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

895
00:37:24.701 --> 00:37:27.520
<v Speaker 2>I've read a couple of them and I saw and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I looked down to that and I go,</v>

896
00:37:27.521 --> 00:37:28.420
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even going in.</v>

897
00:37:28.421 --> 00:37:29.770
<v Speaker 2>I can't go in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do this,</v>

898
00:37:30.190 --> 00:37:30.640
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

899
00:37:30.641 --> 00:37:33.220
<v Speaker 2>It would be nice to do a sitcom again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love doing news radio.</v>

900
00:37:33.221 --> 00:37:35.950
<v Speaker 2>It was a lot of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But good luck trying to find another one</v>

901
00:37:35.951 --> 00:37:36.640
<v Speaker 2>of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

902
00:37:36.641 --> 00:37:37.870
<v Speaker 2>Dave [inaudible] was going to do the </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>

903
00:37:38.610 --> 00:37:40.690
<v Speaker 2>Don't touch with Dave Pollino very </v>
<v Speaker 2>excited.</v>

904
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:42.250
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

905
00:37:42.251 --> 00:37:47.251
<v Speaker 2>it's like getting a hold of one of those</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitcoms as like a fucking one of the </v>

906
00:37:47.251 --> 00:37:47.251
<v Speaker 2>million and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you don't do that,</v>

907
00:37:47.251 --> 00:37:48.150
<v Speaker 2>what are you dealing with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

908
00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:51.370
<v Speaker 2>you're dealing with a bunch of producers</v>
<v Speaker 2>that don't really know how to do comedy.</v>

909
00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:56.520
<v Speaker 2>You're dealing with a bunch of writers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of them are not going to be </v>

910
00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:58.681
<v Speaker 2>talented because if they were talented </v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd be working for modern family or </v>

911
00:37:58.681 --> 00:38:01.861
<v Speaker 2>some of those big shows and there's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>that many really good ones that are out </v>

912
00:38:01.861 --> 00:38:01.861
<v Speaker 2>there free,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

913
00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:05.230
<v Speaker 2>So it's like your odds of finding a good</v>
<v Speaker 2>one or like one in 10,</v>

914
00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:06.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe maybe one in 20.</v>

915
00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:08.940
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I uh,</v>

916
00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:14.790
<v Speaker 8>Paul prevents and I started writing a </v>
<v Speaker 8>movie together on this idea that I had </v>

917
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:17.210
<v Speaker 8>and I met Paul and Edinburgh.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was doing the Edinburgh festival and I</v>

918
00:38:17.590 --> 00:38:19.580
<v Speaker 8>kind of did the thing is a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And he's like,</v>

919
00:38:19.581 --> 00:38:20.330
<v Speaker 8>what?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I said,</v>

920
00:38:20.331 --> 00:38:21.860
<v Speaker 8>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I've tried to write a movie about that.</v>

921
00:38:21.861 --> 00:38:23.180
<v Speaker 8>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Hey,</v>

922
00:38:23.181 --> 00:38:23.920
<v Speaker 8>you should write that fucking</v>

923
00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:28.950
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the bit that you said is the </v>

924
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:28.950
<v Speaker 2>same as my bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The one that I talked about on the show,</v>

925
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:31.230
<v Speaker 2>very similar as A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a bit that I used to do.</v>

926
00:38:31.370 --> 00:38:36.370
<v Speaker 2>I did it back in the nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just talked about it on the show the </v>

927
00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:39.711
<v Speaker 2>other day because we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were both on the green room show </v>

928
00:38:39.711 --> 00:38:42.571
<v Speaker 2>together and there was um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about like being booed </v>

929
00:38:42.571 --> 00:38:43.510
<v Speaker 2>off stage and like when people want you </v>
<v Speaker 2>to change the subject,</v>

930
00:38:43.511 --> 00:38:45.040
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about like how people get</v>
<v Speaker 2>upset at you.</v>

931
00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:50.460
<v Speaker 2>And I said that I used to do this joke </v>
<v Speaker 2>about cloning Jesus because there was a </v>

932
00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:51.880
<v Speaker 2>thing called a second coming project.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the second project was.</v>

933
00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:55.780
<v Speaker 2>That's funny that that's what we named </v>
<v Speaker 2>the script was the second coming because</v>

934
00:38:55.781 --> 00:38:57.910
<v Speaker 2>it's all about the guy jerking off is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the opening scene.</v>

935
00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:58.900
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

936
00:38:59.430 --> 00:39:01.080
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

937
00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:04.000
<v Speaker 2>there was a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was in the news about this many,</v>

938
00:39:04.001 --> 00:39:04.960
<v Speaker 2>many years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

939
00:39:05.890 --> 00:39:10.890
<v Speaker 2>the idea was they were going to take dna</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the shroud of Turin and they were </v>

940
00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:12.280
<v Speaker 2>going to recreate Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were going to clone Jesus.</v>

941
00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:14.230
<v Speaker 2>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my job was like,</v>

942
00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:16.380
<v Speaker 2>and this is a real thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they really think,</v>

943
00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:19.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure it might've been a parody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

944
00:39:19.061 --> 00:39:20.110
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The sneak through.</v>

945
00:39:20.111 --> 00:39:22.630
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rachel maddow got busted on a parody the</v>

946
00:39:22.631 --> 00:39:24.970
<v Speaker 2>other day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She was a reading a parody.</v>

947
00:39:25.150 --> 00:39:27.100
<v Speaker 2>This Christian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fake website.</v>

948
00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:32.340
<v Speaker 2>And she was reading it as if it was news</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Palin's supporters really believe </v>

949
00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:32.340
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

950
00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:34.890
<v Speaker 2>we have to inject Christianity into </v>
<v Speaker 2>North Africa.</v>

951
00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:38.260
<v Speaker 2>And it's really funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And some of my bid was,</v>

952
00:39:38.261 --> 00:39:39.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Dolly the sheep,</v>

953
00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:40.600
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they cloned Dolly the sheep,</v>

954
00:39:40.601 --> 00:39:41.790
<v Speaker 2>that Shit didn't come out perfect.</v>

955
00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:44.100
<v Speaker 2>Like cloning is not an exact science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what if they,</v>

956
00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:45.760
<v Speaker 2>what do they do with the first Jesus if </v>
<v Speaker 2>the clone,</v>

957
00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:50.780
<v Speaker 2>when it comes out retarded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you kill them and start from scratch </v>

958
00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:50.780
<v Speaker 2>or do you just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

959
00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:52.960
<v Speaker 2>And so this whole bit about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I did it at the comedy store,</v>

960
00:39:52.961 --> 00:39:57.961
<v Speaker 2>someone was yelling out fat white woman </v>
<v Speaker 2>with blonde hair and fat blond fingers,</v>

961
00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:02.430
<v Speaker 2>just that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

962
00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:07.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm a Christian next subject.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like she was so firm and her wonky </v>

963
00:40:09.911 --> 00:40:13.810
<v Speaker 2>beliefs that she wanted a styling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just theoretical idea.</v>

964
00:40:13.811 --> 00:40:16.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not a real Jesus we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about this is a.</v>

965
00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:19.900
<v Speaker 2>and it's a real legit question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they really do clone Jesus,</v>

966
00:40:20.110 --> 00:40:25.110
<v Speaker 2>that's a God legit question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what if they found Jesus's bones </v>

967
00:40:25.110 --> 00:40:25.750
<v Speaker 2>and there was some DNA inside of it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they could extract it.</v>

968
00:40:25.751 --> 00:40:27.280
<v Speaker 2>They knew for sure it was de Jesus.</v>

969
00:40:27.310 --> 00:40:28.900
<v Speaker 2>They knew it was his DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

970
00:40:28.901 --> 00:40:33.901
<v Speaker 2>that's a real legit question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if he does come back retarded </v>

971
00:40:33.901 --> 00:40:33.901
<v Speaker 2>because he could come back all fucked </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

972
00:40:33.901 --> 00:40:38.580
<v Speaker 2>There could be all sorts of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could be autistic and psychopath </v>

973
00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:39.470
<v Speaker 2>could be black as fuck with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if he was my,</v>

974
00:40:39.590 --> 00:40:41.500
<v Speaker 2>I think it was black.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

975
00:40:41.620 --> 00:40:44.270
<v Speaker 2>Because you can't start off white and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then go put there.</v>

976
00:40:44.370 --> 00:40:49.370
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of evidence that Jesus </v>

977
00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:51.180
<v Speaker 2>wasn't even real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a lot of evidence that there was </v>

978
00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:53.641
<v Speaker 2>no Jesus started mythologized and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>this same mythology repeats itself over </v>

979
00:40:53.641 --> 00:40:54.280
<v Speaker 2>and over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Jesus,</v>

980
00:40:54.281 --> 00:40:56.680
<v Speaker 2>even as a historical figures in </v>
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>

981
00:40:56.681 --> 00:40:57.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like,</v>

982
00:40:57.820 --> 00:40:58.730
<v Speaker 2>there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

983
00:40:58.750 --> 00:41:03.750
<v Speaker 2>volumes of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of pages written about certain Caesar's </v>

984
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:03.750
<v Speaker 2>and certain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

985
00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:04.550
<v Speaker 2>rulers of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

986
00:41:04.770 --> 00:41:06.310
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Greece and Rome.</v>

987
00:41:06.311 --> 00:41:08.590
<v Speaker 2>And so the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the stuff that's on Jesus's,</v>

988
00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:13.640
<v Speaker 2>so it's really hard to tell whether it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>real well and also all those biblical </v>

989
00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:13.970
<v Speaker 2>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

990
00:41:13.990 --> 00:41:16.090
<v Speaker 2>like everything from all the matthew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mark,</v>

991
00:41:16.091 --> 00:41:17.280
<v Speaker 2>Luke and John.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was like,</v>

992
00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:19.060
<v Speaker 2>there was the bulk of q two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

993
00:41:19.061 --> 00:41:21.460
<v Speaker 2>but that there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a fifth book of the Gospels.</v>

994
00:41:21.461 --> 00:41:24.970
<v Speaker 2>Apparently that was luke based.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His book on,</v>

995
00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:27.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm not completely accurate and all this</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>

996
00:41:27.131 --> 00:41:32.131
<v Speaker 2>but if you start reading about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll find out that like all four of </v>

997
00:41:32.131 --> 00:41:34.520
<v Speaker 2>them didn't live at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so some of them base their account</v>

998
00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:37.490
<v Speaker 5>on the other ones because they'll say </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's like identical of the other one.</v>

999
00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:40.100
<v Speaker 5>So it's like they just heard a story.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1000
00:41:40.101 --> 00:41:45.101
<v Speaker 5>and just rewrote it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which could have happened from the </v>

1001
00:41:45.101 --> 00:41:47.201
<v Speaker 5>beginning and then there was also like </v>
<v Speaker 5>the council of nicea where these guys </v>

1002
00:41:47.201 --> 00:41:48.260
<v Speaker 5>went in and decided the bishops all </v>
<v Speaker 5>went,</v>

1003
00:41:48.261 --> 00:41:49.850
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well we've got all these books.</v>

1004
00:41:49.851 --> 00:41:51.830
<v Speaker 5>We're going to throw out these ones.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We don't like these.</v>

1005
00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:56.980
<v Speaker 5>We're going to keep the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just rewrote history the way they </v>

1006
00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:59.261
<v Speaker 5>wanted it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I mean it's like shit like that on </v>

1007
00:41:59.261 --> 00:41:59.261
<v Speaker 5>there for you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you find out about the New Testament,</v>

1008
00:41:59.261 --> 00:42:04.001
<v Speaker 5>that's where things get really weird </v>
<v Speaker 5>because constantine and a bunch of </v>

1009
00:42:04.001 --> 00:42:06.641
<v Speaker 5>bishops create that New Testament.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the know what you're talking </v>

1010
00:42:06.641 --> 00:42:10.451
<v Speaker 5>about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Something that was way after Jesus's </v>

1011
00:42:10.451 --> 00:42:10.451
<v Speaker 5>death.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1012
00:42:10.451 --> 00:42:11.570
<v Speaker 5>if Jesus was a real figure,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the whole thing is fucking squirrely.</v>

1013
00:42:11.870 --> 00:42:16.870
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the historical account just mean not </v>

1014
00:42:16.870 --> 00:42:16.980
<v Speaker 5>even saying the religious accompany </v>
<v Speaker 5>historical accounts various quarterly.</v>

1015
00:42:17.790 --> 00:42:22.430
<v Speaker 5>I don't know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like Dolly being retarded.</v>

1016
00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:24.230
<v Speaker 5>I've often wondered like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1017
00:42:24.231 --> 00:42:26.180
<v Speaker 5>when like a dog bite someone,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody's like,</v>

1018
00:42:26.181 --> 00:42:27.260
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's a bad dog or whatever.</v>

1019
00:42:27.261 --> 00:42:29.690
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you see people all the time,</v>

1020
00:42:29.691 --> 00:42:33.430
<v Speaker 5>like people with down syndrome.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are there like down syndrome dogs?</v>

1021
00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:38.580
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going through minds where your </v>

1022

<v Speaker 5>really overbred you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have uh,</v>

1025
00:42:41.821 --> 00:42:44.840

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:50.230
<v Speaker 5>That came from a wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1030
00:42:50.520 --> 00:42:54.630
<v Speaker 5>There's no way you get a good example if</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is what you get from a wolf.</v>

1031
00:42:54.631 --> 00:42:56.690
<v Speaker 5>I think my dog might be part wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

<v Speaker 5>year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1059
00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:58.010
<v Speaker 5>my dog's leash lists all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People you can call me an asshole,</v>

1060
00:43:58.011 --> 00:44:00.050
<v Speaker 5>but I don't believe in putting a dog on </v>
<v Speaker 5>a leash.</v>

1061
00:44:00.051 --> 00:44:02.770
<v Speaker 5>And my dogs well behaved and she's </v>
<v Speaker 5>amazing.</v>

<v Speaker 5>well behaved.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just when people walk around with like </v>

<v Speaker 5>Amazing.</v>

1066
00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:13.950
<v Speaker 5>And so the way I used to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a retard when I,</v>

1067
00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:15.890
<v Speaker 5>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I get close to home,</v>

1068
00:44:15.891 --> 00:44:16.580
<v Speaker 5>I'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

1069
00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:19.430
<v Speaker 5>go home and she'll run like 200 meters </v>
<v Speaker 5>up the road.</v>

1070
00:44:19.790 --> 00:44:22.100
<v Speaker 5>So I one I'd see this cat and she </v>
<v Speaker 5>chased,</v>

1071
00:44:22.130 --> 00:44:24.050
<v Speaker 5>she never would hurt a cat but you'll </v>
<v Speaker 5>play with them.</v>

1072
00:44:24.051 --> 00:44:24.650
<v Speaker 5>So I go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go,</v>

1073
00:44:24.651 --> 00:44:25.580
<v Speaker 5>go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a cat.</v>

1074
00:44:26.150 --> 00:44:28.400
<v Speaker 5>You told him to chase the kid and she </v>
<v Speaker 5>just plays with the cat.</v>

1075
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:32.280
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so she goes running up the road</v>

1076
00:44:32.370 --> 00:44:35.010
<v Speaker 4>and all of a sudden I hear her go ma and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1079
00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:42.390
<v Speaker 4>never fought before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I come around the corner.</v>

1080
00:44:42.391 --> 00:44:44.160
<v Speaker 4>It's not a cat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a fucking raccoon.</v>

1081
00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:45.690
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>And the cat takes or the raccoon takes </v>
<v Speaker 4>off.</v>

1083
00:44:47.731 --> 00:44:50.550
<v Speaker 4>So you totally chase after a raccoon </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking it was a cat.</v>

1084
00:44:51.570 --> 00:44:54.540
<v Speaker 4>And how did you mistake the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was so far away.</v>

<v Speaker 4>So I wake up the next day and they see </v>

1086
00:44:59.590 --> 00:45:01.740
<v Speaker 4>my dog sitting there and the eyes are </v>
<v Speaker 4>crusted shut.</v>

1087
00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:03.420

<v Speaker 4>what the fuck?</v>

1088

<v Speaker 4>the record scratch both their corneas.</v>

<v Speaker 4>the vet said these things will rip your </v>

1091
00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:16.130
<v Speaker 4>dog apart.</v>

<v Speaker 4>convoluted conversation.</v>

1094
00:45:24.090 --> 00:45:26.790
<v Speaker 4>They said they'll rip your dog apart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>

1095
00:45:26.791 --> 00:45:27.750

<v Speaker 4>California,</v>

1097
00:45:29.820 --> 00:45:31.130
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not bad.</v>

1098
00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:33.880
<v Speaker 4>But the rackets fucking fucking scary </v>
<v Speaker 4>man recommended.</v>

1099
00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:35.490
<v Speaker 4>There was when I lived in new Rochelle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>New York,</v>

1100
00:45:35.491 --> 00:45:38.400
<v Speaker 4>I had a big one in my neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He used to fuck up trash cans.</v>

1101
00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:40.410
<v Speaker 4>He was gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1102
00:45:40.411 --> 00:45:43.170
<v Speaker 4>it was like a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't believe how big he was.</v>

1103
00:45:43.171 --> 00:45:48.171
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got a blow gun just so I can try to </v>

1104
00:45:48.171 --> 00:45:48.171
<v Speaker 4>kill him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was terrified.</v>

1105
00:45:48.171 --> 00:45:48.360
<v Speaker 4>I opened the door,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a small,</v>

1106
00:45:48.361 --> 00:45:53.361
<v Speaker 4>I had a small little yard and I would </v>
<v Speaker 4>open the door and he would literally be </v>

1107
00:45:53.361 --> 00:45:53.730
<v Speaker 4>fucking 10 feet from me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I panic and slam the door.</v>

1108
00:45:54.250 --> 00:45:55.020
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get out of here,</v>

1109
00:45:55.021 --> 00:45:55.470
<v Speaker 4>bitch.</v>

1110
00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:57.790
<v Speaker 9>My,</v>
<v Speaker 9>my old dog Cabo at one site level,</v>

1111
00:45:57.840 --> 00:46:02.840
<v Speaker 9>Islam out the backyard and just to go to</v>
<v Speaker 9>the bathroom and I'd let them out and </v>

1112
00:46:02.840 --> 00:46:03.280
<v Speaker 9>instead of going around like,</v>
<v Speaker 9>oh,</v>

1113
00:46:03.310 --> 00:46:05.740
<v Speaker 9>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 9>So I go outside and it's two skunks,</v>

1114
00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:09.310
<v Speaker 9>like corner did my little backyard and </v>
<v Speaker 9>the dogs about to attack them.</v>

1115
00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:14.460
<v Speaker 9>And I'm just thinking I don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 9>get sprayed and want the dog to get </v>

1116
00:46:14.460 --> 00:46:14.700
<v Speaker 9>sprayed.</v>
<v Speaker 9>Takes forever to clean.</v>

1117
00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:17.770
<v Speaker 9>My dog got sprayed when I was a little </v>
<v Speaker 9>kid.</v>

1118
00:46:18.850 --> 00:46:20.830
<v Speaker 9>It's the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 9>It takes forever.</v>

1119
00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:26.050
<v Speaker 4>You use tomato juice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Apparently there's an enzyme and </v>

1120
00:46:26.050 --> 00:46:27.090
<v Speaker 4>tomatoes that helps break it down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not much tomato and it doesn't work.</v>

1121
00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:29.290
<v Speaker 4>You got to keep doing it over and over </v>
<v Speaker 4>and over again.</v>

1122
00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:32.440
<v Speaker 4>The stuck for weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever heard the Billy Burger bit</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1139
00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:17.370
<v Speaker 4>You know when they figured out that </v>
<v Speaker 4>genetic lineage of dogs,</v>

1140
00:47:17.371 --> 00:47:19.710
<v Speaker 4>they expected to be a bunch of wild </v>
<v Speaker 4>candidates in there.</v>

1141
00:47:19.711 --> 00:47:22.170
<v Speaker 4>A bunch of different kinds of canines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's a different kind of dog and </v>
<v Speaker 4>welcoming.</v>

1145
00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:28.890
<v Speaker 4>It's a candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A wild.</v>

1146
00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.670
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know if there's specific ones,</v>

1147
00:47:30.810 --> 00:47:32.590
<v Speaker 4>that Dingo doesn't come from a wolf,</v>
<v Speaker 4>does it?</v>

1148
00:47:32.591 --> 00:47:33.580
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good question.</v>

1149
00:47:33.581 --> 00:47:36.330
<v Speaker 4>It's an Australian thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1150
00:47:36.340 --> 00:47:40.000
<v Speaker 4>The dingoes eat babies Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My dog looks like a Dingo.</v>

1151
00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:45.120
<v Speaker 4>Do Kangaroos kill people?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a recycling of discussion one </v>

1152
00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:47.170
<v Speaker 4>time I got out of a car and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was a fucking,</v>

1153
00:47:47.230 --> 00:47:48.760
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're driving through this neighborhood.</v>

1154
00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:49.780
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why we're in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>neighborhood.</v>

1155
00:47:49.781 --> 00:47:53.110
<v Speaker 4>Simple yes or no hair.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

1156
00:47:53.111 --> 00:47:58.111
<v Speaker 4>but I've heard stories that yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because when we went to the zoo in </v>

1157
00:47:58.111 --> 00:47:59.260
<v Speaker 4>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they told us the big ones,</v>

1158
00:47:59.261 --> 00:48:00.670
<v Speaker 4>the big.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's big Kangaroos.</v>

1159
00:48:00.671 --> 00:48:02.620
<v Speaker 4>I forget which kinds of the big ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are the red ones?</v>

1160
00:48:02.621 --> 00:48:04.360
<v Speaker 4>The gray ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The big ones.</v>

1161
00:48:04.361 --> 00:48:06.130
<v Speaker 4>Kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they have a bunch of times.</v>

1162
00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:08.340
<v Speaker 4>They said you have to be very careful if</v>
<v Speaker 4>you approach them in the wild.</v>

1163
00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:12.280
<v Speaker 4>This thing I read the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it said like a hundred people die a year</v>

1164
00:48:12.281 --> 00:48:13.990
<v Speaker 4>from it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then this other website,</v>

1165
00:48:14.010 --> 00:48:19.010
<v Speaker 4>it's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's been a few known attacks in the </v>

1166
00:48:19.010 --> 00:48:19.010
<v Speaker 4>history of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1168
00:48:20.531 --> 00:48:23.080
<v Speaker 4>her dogs were killed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The most recent attack that I could find</v>

1169
00:48:23.081 --> 00:48:25.570
<v Speaker 4>online.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this kangaroo drowned her dogs.</v>

1170
00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:26.590
<v Speaker 4>That's pretty high.</v>

00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:29.230
<v Speaker 4>Fuck gangster IRA's grout.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Drown your dog.</v>

1172
00:48:29.500 --> 00:48:34.500
<v Speaker 4>I saw the biggest fucking kangaroo and I</v>
<v Speaker 4>thought it was a statue in these </v>

1173
00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:34.750
<v Speaker 4>people's yard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

1174
00:48:35.050 --> 00:48:37.020
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who has this giant kangaroo statue?</v>

1175
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:39.880
<v Speaker 4>I mean like 10 foot tall white.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Looked like it was.</v>

1176
00:48:39.881 --> 00:48:44.881
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once they get to be like seven feet </v>

1177
00:48:44.881 --> 00:48:44.881
<v Speaker 4>tall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as tall as your ceiling and come off,</v>

1178
00:48:44.881 --> 00:48:46.710
<v Speaker 4>I swear to God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I got out of the car.</v>

1179
00:48:46.770 --> 00:48:48.980
<v Speaker 4>So this is like a 10 foot ceiling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many feet?</v>

1180
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:50.440
<v Speaker 4>Ten feet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

1181
00:48:50.441 --> 00:48:55.441
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two other comics and I see this thing </v>

1182
00:48:55.441 --> 00:48:55.441
<v Speaker 4>over by these garbage cans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1183
00:48:55.441 --> 00:48:55.690
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at this fucking thing.</v>

1184
00:48:55.810 --> 00:48:59.470
<v Speaker 4>And I start walking towards it and this </v>
<v Speaker 4>comic named Tommy Johnson goes,</v>

1185
00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:01.660
<v Speaker 4>get out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck back in the car,</v>

<v Speaker 4>And I'm walking towards it.</v>

1188
00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:08.680
<v Speaker 4>And all of a sudden I see it move and </v>
<v Speaker 4>now he's like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1191
00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:18.420
<v Speaker 4>That's what they claim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's like an urban myth that </v>

1192
00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:18.590
<v Speaker 4>they just fucking rip your stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh No,</v>

1193
00:49:18.610 --> 00:49:19.630
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not an urban myth.</v>

1194
00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:21.940
<v Speaker 4>People definitely have been attacked in </v>
<v Speaker 4>that manner.</v>

1195
00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:26.350
<v Speaker 4>They just got punched in the red.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The red kangaroo is the big one.</v>

1196
00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:31.560
<v Speaker 4>I'm just trying to find out how that </v>
<v Speaker 4>would fucking freak me out if I saw a </v>

1197

<v Speaker 4>I don't think they're that big though.</v>

1199
00:49:33.281 --> 00:49:34.720
<v Speaker 4>I think you were afraid they were that </v>

<v Speaker 4>I thought it was about seven.</v>

1202
00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:41.020
<v Speaker 4>I'd say seven,</v>

<v Speaker 4>the zoo and in Australia it was fucking.</v>

<v Speaker 4>the boxing love Jesus Christ did know </v>

<v Speaker 4>but the red grows to nine fucking food.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was walking to it because I swear </v>

1232
00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:56.360
<v Speaker 4>while people are content to them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure that's probably why people hate</v>

1233
00:50:56.361 --> 00:50:57.470
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They think they're rodents.</v>

1237
00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:09.761
<v Speaker 4>rats.</v>

00:51:09.761 --> 00:51:10.880
<v Speaker 4>and groovy and no plague will just eat </v>
<v Speaker 4>nuts.</v>

1239
00:51:10.881 --> 00:51:11.950
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to eat garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

<v Speaker 4>York City.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rents are fucking terrifying.</v>

1245
00:51:21.830 --> 00:51:23.990
<v Speaker 4>I remember when I lived in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I've told this story,</v>

1246
00:51:23.991 --> 00:51:24.920
<v Speaker 4>but I'll tell it again for this.</v>

1247
00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:27.940
<v Speaker 4>I was at a gas station once and I went </v>
<v Speaker 4>to use up sofa a payphone.</v>

1248
00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:29.690
<v Speaker 4>This is how old this story is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1249
00:51:29.691 --> 00:51:30.860

<v Speaker 4>I didn't have a cell phone,</v>

1250
00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:32.720
<v Speaker 4>so I stepped away from my car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1251
00:51:32.721 --> 00:51:37.721
<v Speaker 4>my car is pumping gas and I go to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>payphone and I'm on the payphone and </v>

1252
00:51:37.721 --> 00:51:38.450
<v Speaker 4>while I'm on the payphone I'm watching </v>
<v Speaker 4>rats,</v>

1253
00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:42.380
<v Speaker 4>big ones like cats jumped in the wheel </v>
<v Speaker 4>housing of my car,</v>

1254
00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:44.240
<v Speaker 4>climb on the tires,</v>
<v Speaker 4>climbed down,</v>

1255
00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:45.950
<v Speaker 4>and I am your car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1256
00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:51.040
<v Speaker 4>I'm fucking 15 feet away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I stepped over to use the payphone and </v>

1257
00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:54.701
<v Speaker 4>as I'm standing there on the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've watched these rats and they keep </v>

1258
00:51:54.701 --> 00:51:57.431
<v Speaker 4>going down this opening in the manhole.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There must have been thousands of them </v>

1259
00:51:57.431 --> 00:51:59.900
<v Speaker 4>down there the way they were coming up </v>
<v Speaker 4>so quickly and in,</v>

1260
00:51:59.901 --> 00:52:00.270
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

1261
00:52:00.271 --> 00:52:02.030
<v Speaker 4>in such rapid succession.</v>

1262
00:52:02.030 --> 00:52:03.440
<v Speaker 4>One after the other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one after the other,</v>

1263
00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:05.150
<v Speaker 4>and then down one after the other one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1264
00:52:05.151 --> 00:52:10.151
<v Speaker 4>there's just a train of them down there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I went and reported my car stolen.</v>

1265
00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:13.340
<v Speaker 4>So scary dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>More rats than people in the air.</v>

1266
00:52:13.350 --> 00:52:15.500

<v Speaker 4>I think it's for rats for every person.</v>

1267
00:52:15.530 --> 00:52:20.530
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was walking down macdougal street one </v>

1268
00:52:20.530 --> 00:52:20.880
<v Speaker 4>time hump from the seller one night and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just walking through it and then you</v>

1269
00:52:20.890 --> 00:52:25.890
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people with their garbage out in the </v>

1270
00:52:25.890 --> 00:52:25.890
<v Speaker 4>street for the garbage men to pick them </v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

1271
00:52:25.890 --> 00:52:28.660
<v Speaker 4>I'm going between garbage and a building</v>
<v Speaker 4>and all of a sudden a rat just will runs</v>

1272
00:52:28.851 --> 00:52:31.760
<v Speaker 4>out from the garbage and uses.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My foot is like a hurdle.</v>

1273
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:37.150
<v Speaker 4>Little feet touched my foot and it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>the most I've ever been like a woman in </v>

1274
00:52:37.150 --> 00:52:42.101
<v Speaker 4>my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I started like jumping up and down like </v>

1275
00:52:42.101 --> 00:52:45.041
<v Speaker 4>screaming because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like that fucking like adrenaline </v>

1276

<v Speaker 4>rush goes and you can't fight.</v>

1277
00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:47.960
<v Speaker 4>You're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

1278
00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:52.460
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was as big as you were.</v>

1279
00:52:52.461 --> 00:52:57.461
<v Speaker 4>Such pussies were such pussies compared </v>
<v Speaker 4>to animals were so soft and mushy and </v>

1280
00:52:58.881 --> 00:53:01.970
<v Speaker 4>fleshy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's the the filth though of the</v>

1281
00:53:01.971 --> 00:53:03.260
<v Speaker 4>rats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just the film.</v>

1282
00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:08.280
<v Speaker 4>They're furious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're fucking army as much as the </v>

1283
00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:12.131
<v Speaker 4>filth of those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They you feel like they carry hepatitis </v>

1284
00:53:12.131 --> 00:53:15.610

<v Speaker 4>connected to rants is not all my rent's </v>

1285

<v Speaker 4>not a bunch of plagues had been about </v>
<v Speaker 4>ransom.</v>

1286
00:53:17.690 --> 00:53:20.260
<v Speaker 4>They're horrible carriers of diseases.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who is it?</v>

1287
00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:25.450
<v Speaker 4>Jim Norton and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think as Jim Norton and rich Vos used </v>

1288
00:53:25.450 --> 00:53:25.980
<v Speaker 4>to go to this one park in New York and </v>
<v Speaker 4>sit there and watch</v>

1289
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:29.350
<v Speaker 2>the rats and they said you'd see like </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of these racks.</v>

1290
00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:30.990
<v Speaker 2>There's so many of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Manhattan,</v>

1291
00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:33.810
<v Speaker 2>Manhattan is so crazy with rats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at a pool hall,</v>

1292
00:53:33.811 --> 00:53:38.811
<v Speaker 2>wants a New Jersey and this is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>scariest read I ever saw was with my </v>

1293
00:53:38.811 --> 00:53:38.811
<v Speaker 2>friend John.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We went,</v>

1294
00:53:38.811 --> 00:53:40.230
<v Speaker 2>we were doing a Gig and we stopped home </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the Gig to play some pool.</v>

1295
00:53:40.231 --> 00:53:45.231
<v Speaker 2>We stopped this pool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get out of the car and as I'm walking </v>

1296
00:53:45.231 --> 00:53:45.750
<v Speaker 2>towards the door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a dumpster like outside.</v>

1297
00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:50.960
<v Speaker 2>And as I passed by the dumpster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the biggest rat I've ever seen </v>

1298
00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:52.680
<v Speaker 2>in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it is like a raccoon.</v>

1299
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:55.890
<v Speaker 2>It was gigantic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No bullshit.</v>

1300
00:53:55.891 --> 00:53:57.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm not bullshitting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was two and a half,</v>

1301
00:53:57.901 --> 00:54:02.900
<v Speaker 2>maybe three feet long in the body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was enormous and it had these shoes,</v>

1302
00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:07.920
<v Speaker 2>huge fucking nasty yellow teeth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know if it was sick or </v>

1303
00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:07.920
<v Speaker 2>dying.</v>

1304
00:54:07.920 --> 00:54:12.590
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might have been old age because it </v>

1305
00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:12.590
<v Speaker 2>was so big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might've been the end of the line for</v>

1306
00:54:12.590 --> 00:54:15.561
<v Speaker 2>this fucking thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was up on its back legs and was </v>

1307
00:54:15.561 --> 00:54:17.871
<v Speaker 2>going like this to me and I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>

1308
00:54:18.301 --> 00:54:20.730
<v Speaker 2>do I kick this thing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do I get a rock?</v>

1309
00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:24.720
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just such a little girly man.</v>

1310
00:54:25.980 --> 00:54:30.980
<v Speaker 2>I'll never forget that noise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you got to think with all the </v>

1311
00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:30.980
<v Speaker 2>poison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They lay down,</v>

1312
00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:31.440
<v Speaker 2>like you'll see the signs of the subway </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

1313
00:54:31.441 --> 00:54:32.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>careful,</v>

1314
00:54:32.491 --> 00:54:34.070
<v Speaker 2>there's like poison everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ran with.</v>

1315
00:54:34.650 --> 00:54:39.650
<v Speaker 2>They've got to be adapting and mutating </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're making some fucking scary rat </v>

1316
00:54:41.070 --> 00:54:42.300
<v Speaker 2>just chorus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1317
00:54:42.330 --> 00:54:47.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what happens with </v>

1318
00:54:47.330 --> 00:54:47.330
<v Speaker 2>bacteria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1319
00:54:47.330 --> 00:54:50.181
<v Speaker 2>That's where we're at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Murcia know that staph infection that </v>

1320
00:54:50.181 --> 00:54:52.240
<v Speaker 2>people get this antibiotic resistant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is from fucking.</v>

1321
00:54:52.270 --> 00:54:53.550
<v Speaker 2>Is that like the superbug?</v>

1322
00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:55.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well the mercer has the super staff.</v>

1323
00:54:55.920 --> 00:55:00.920
<v Speaker 2>It said Mike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it actually stands </v>

1324
00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:02.220
<v Speaker 2>for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's something resistant staff.</v>

1325
00:55:02.250 --> 00:55:05.160
<v Speaker 2>So it's a antibiotic resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when people get it,</v>

1326
00:55:05.161 --> 00:55:10.161
<v Speaker 2>it's like really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really dangerous and it's really just </v>

1327
00:55:10.161 --> 00:55:10.161
<v Speaker 2>created by human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>

1328
00:55:10.161 --> 00:55:14.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was fighting off different versions </v>

1329
00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:14.300
<v Speaker 2>until the only ones who survive are </v>
<v Speaker 2>super fucking strong.</v>

1330
00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:18.640
<v Speaker 2>It's why it just read the other day that</v>
<v Speaker 2>80 percent of all the antibiotics in </v>

1331
00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:22.131
<v Speaker 2>America are given to animals like they </v>
<v Speaker 2>pump them full of antibiotics and the </v>

1332
00:55:22.131 --> 00:55:24.660
<v Speaker 2>same bacteria that we've used </v>
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics to fight off.</v>

1333
00:55:24.990 --> 00:55:29.040
<v Speaker 2>So do animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all the antibiotics they're taking is</v>

1334
00:55:29.041 --> 00:55:34.041
<v Speaker 2>causing the bacteria to butyrate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is making us immune to these </v>

1335
00:55:34.041 --> 00:55:34.620
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics to live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that true?</v>

1336
00:55:34.740 --> 00:55:35.340
<v Speaker 2>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1337
00:55:35.341 --> 00:55:36.600
<v Speaker 2>I was on a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a,</v>

1338
00:55:36.660 --> 00:55:38.870
<v Speaker 2>I did a thing about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1339
00:55:39.290 --> 00:55:44.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about food inc and I got </v>

1340
00:55:44.290 --> 00:55:45.810
<v Speaker 2>contacted and this is one of the coolest</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking things about this podcast.</v>

1341
00:55:46.050 --> 00:55:50.160
<v Speaker 2>I got contacted by a bunch of scientists</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck food scientists,</v>

1342
00:55:50.250 --> 00:55:51.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are,</v>

1343
00:55:51.511 --> 00:55:52.150
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1344
00:55:52.200 --> 00:55:57.200
<v Speaker 2>involved in the farms and one guy who </v>
<v Speaker 2>worked for a poultry company.</v>

1345
00:55:58.170 --> 00:55:58.980
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>

1346
00:55:58.981 --> 00:56:00.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to me about it.</v>

1347
00:56:00.600 --> 00:56:05.600
<v Speaker 2>Let me find it here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shows the difference between your </v>

1348
00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:07.671
<v Speaker 2>listeners in ours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have all these intelligent people </v>

1349
00:56:07.671 --> 00:56:07.671
<v Speaker 2>that are really interested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We get guys who were like,</v>

1350
00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:11.970
<v Speaker 2>you guys are fucked guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I get those to watch corn too.</v>

1351
00:56:11.971 --> 00:56:16.971
<v Speaker 2>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever get the chance to watch </v>

1352
00:56:16.971 --> 00:56:18.261
<v Speaker 2>the documentary that that's where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>even go into more detail about having </v>

1353
00:56:18.261 --> 00:56:19.470
<v Speaker 2>like having holes on the side of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cows.</v>

1354
00:56:20.250 --> 00:56:21.940
<v Speaker 2>So creepy and Food Inc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a whole.</v>

1355
00:56:22.730 --> 00:56:24.040
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well iT's according to this guy.</v>

1356
00:56:24.041 --> 00:56:26.410
<v Speaker 2>First of all when he wanted it and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>name is Jacob Kim.</v>

1357
00:56:26.411 --> 00:56:31.411
<v Speaker 2>So thank you jacob.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At one of the things that he explained </v>

1358
00:56:31.411 --> 00:56:34.861
<v Speaker 2>to me is that chickens are not on </v>
<v Speaker 2>steroids and then what it is is just </v>

1359
00:56:34.861 --> 00:56:38.581
<v Speaker 2>genetic selection and they've naturally </v>
<v Speaker 2>selected birds with bigger and bigger </v>

1360
00:56:38.581 --> 00:56:38.950
<v Speaker 2>breasts to the point where they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>freaks.</v>

1361
00:56:39.130 --> 00:56:41.500
<v Speaker 2>So they wouldn't have survive if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were a real animal,</v>

1362
00:56:41.501 --> 00:56:46.501
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we grow them just for their </v>

1363
00:56:46.501 --> 00:56:46.501
<v Speaker 2>tits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1364
00:56:46.501 --> 00:56:49.331
<v Speaker 2>And he also said that What they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to do is they're supposed to </v>

1365
00:56:49.331 --> 00:56:50.650
<v Speaker 2>cycle the antibiotics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when a bird is sick,</v>

1366
00:56:50.651 --> 00:56:52.960
<v Speaker 2>so like they have a cycle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's 49 days,</v>

1367
00:56:52.961 --> 00:56:55.270
<v Speaker 2>he says to grow a bird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in business terms,</v>

1368
00:56:55.271 --> 00:56:58.150
<v Speaker 2>the pharmacy's profits go down as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>flock stays longer than that.</v>

1369
00:56:58.390 --> 00:57:02.080
<v Speaker 2>So in the instance that a 30 day old </v>
<v Speaker 2>flock get sick while they're supposed to</v>

1370
00:57:02.081 --> 00:57:06.640
<v Speaker 2>wait 21 days before they killed them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when they,</v>

1371
00:57:06.670 --> 00:57:10.030
<v Speaker 2>when they get sick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to lose like 10 or 11 days</v>

1372
00:57:10.031 --> 00:57:15.031
<v Speaker 2>of profit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if they do something like that and </v>

1373
00:57:15.031 --> 00:57:15.031
<v Speaker 2>lose these days a prophet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1374
00:57:15.031 --> 00:57:18.961
<v Speaker 2>it's like a problem with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So some unscrupulous companies don't </v>

1375
00:57:18.961 --> 00:57:20.200
<v Speaker 2>follow that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they send out the bird,</v>

1376
00:57:20.260 --> 00:57:25.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 15 days later in the birds still </v>

1412
00:58:43.751 --> 00:58:45.880

<v Speaker 2>So the guy was explaining to me,</v>

1413
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.580
<v Speaker 2>so no steroids for chickens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not true.</v>

1414
00:58:48.581 --> 00:58:51.760
<v Speaker 2>But there it is true for cows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So cows are jacked,</v>

1415
00:58:52.180 --> 00:58:57.180
<v Speaker 2>cows are totally jacked up on hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no hormones at all or no hormones,</v>

1416
00:58:57.590 --> 00:59:00.030
<v Speaker 2>no steroids on chickens because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I eat,</v>

1417
00:59:00.250 --> 00:59:01.780
<v Speaker 2>I eat all grass fed stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1420
00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:06.040
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1421
00:59:06.041 --> 00:59:07.970
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grass fed beef tastes really good.</v>

1422
00:59:08.230 --> 00:59:10.510
<v Speaker 2>Fucking had a strip last night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And pork chops,</v>

<v Speaker 2>grass fed pork chops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1424
00:59:12.210 --> 00:59:17.210
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need pop shields by the way because </v>

1425
00:59:17.210 --> 00:59:18.310
<v Speaker 2>pork chops makes a big terrible noise in</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's ears.</v>

1426
00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:20.220
<v Speaker 2>I ordered those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm soon.</v>

1427
00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:21.710
<v Speaker 2>But I uh,</v>

00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:24.230
<v Speaker 8>a paleo diet.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Do you know that?</v>

1430
00:59:24.450 --> 00:59:25.960
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So I eat that diet and,</v>

1431
00:59:26.010 --> 00:59:28.490
<v Speaker 8>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>in all the grass fed shit and my chicken</v>

1432
00:59:28.491 --> 00:59:32.210
<v Speaker 8>breasts that I get are grass fed and </v>
<v Speaker 8>they're fucking massive.</v>

1433
00:59:32.540 --> 00:59:34.520
<v Speaker 8>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this is weird.</v>

1434
00:59:34.521 --> 00:59:36.990
<v Speaker 8>I heard the whole thing was when you buy</v>
<v Speaker 8>organic and grass,</v>

1435
00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:42.280
<v Speaker 8>that you're Just not getting the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 8>they're bigger chemicals on the grass.</v>

1436
00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:47.780
<v Speaker 8>How is that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't know what's going on in that </v>

1437
00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:48.600
<v Speaker 8>grass.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>

1438
00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:50.930
<v Speaker 8>hey.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So what did you think about that movie</v>

1439
00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:52.860
<v Speaker 2>to avoid?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw it last night.</v>

1440
00:59:52.920 --> 00:59:56.700
<v Speaker 2>I shut it off after the car accident </v>
<v Speaker 2>when the fucking the parents were killed</v>

1441
00:59:56.701 --> 00:59:57.510
<v Speaker 2>in a car accident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1442
00:59:57.630 --> 00:59:59.130
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've just,</v>

1443
00:59:59.160 --> 01:00:01.740
<v Speaker 2>you showed me a girl who's a prostitute </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a stripper.</v>

1444
01:00:01.830 --> 01:00:03.780
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you showed her happy family.</v>

1445
01:00:03.930 --> 01:00:08.930
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's more science fiction in the dmt </v>

1446
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:09.150
<v Speaker 2>shit because that's just shitty writing </v>
<v Speaker 2>to me.</v>

1447
01:00:09.151 --> 01:00:11.460
<v Speaker 2>You're showing me this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This girl loves her brother.</v>

1448
01:00:11.461 --> 01:00:13.020
<v Speaker 2>And how much do you love me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love you so much.</v>

1449
01:00:13.021 --> 01:00:14.520
<v Speaker 2>You're just jerking with my emotions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1450
01:00:14.521 --> 01:00:16.440
<v Speaker 2>This isn't good story writing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is nonsense.</v>

1451
01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:19.380
<v Speaker 2>What I liked about the movie was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first person perspective.</v>

1452
01:00:19.381 --> 01:00:21.090
<v Speaker 2>It was like I was in a video game that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was cool.</v>

1453
01:00:21.450 --> 01:00:26.450
<v Speaker 8>King of the.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I even remember like you could actually </v>

1454
01:00:26.450 --> 01:00:26.730
<v Speaker 8>see it where the character blinks.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They would have it like every,</v>

1455
01:00:26.731 --> 01:00:28.650
<v Speaker 8>like randomly every five,</v>
<v Speaker 8>10 seconds.</v>

1456
01:00:29.070 --> 01:00:34.070
<v Speaker 8>And then when he goes into the dmt trip,</v>
<v Speaker 8>did you think that was a pretty </v>

1457
01:00:34.070 --> 01:00:34.070
<v Speaker 8>realistic?</v>

1458
01:00:34.070 --> 01:00:35.410
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was interesting.</v>

1459
01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:36.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it wasn't realistic.</v>

1460
01:00:37.030 --> 01:00:42.030
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you couldn't explain what the dmt trip </v>

1461
01:00:42.030 --> 01:00:45.631
<v Speaker 2>looks to a person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't recreate it with like cgi.</v>

1462
01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:48.130
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what it is isn't possible.</v>

1463
01:00:48.450 --> 01:00:50.170
<v Speaker 2>What your will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll see.</v>

1464
01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:51.700
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't make any sense what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying.</v>

1465
01:00:52.030 --> 01:00:57.030
<v Speaker 2>But when you have a dmt trip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not seeing anything that can be </v>

1466
01:00:57.030 --> 01:00:58.240
<v Speaker 2>recreated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible to recreate.</v>

1467
01:00:58.270 --> 01:01:03.270
<v Speaker 2>It's like when I'm watching there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>just some swirly cool shit and like </v>

1468
01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:04.330
<v Speaker 2>really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you see it,</v>

1469
01:01:04.420 --> 01:01:06.490
<v Speaker 2>when you see a dmt trip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>

1470
01:01:06.910 --> 01:01:11.910
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a million things at the same time </v>

1471
01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:12.280
<v Speaker 2>it's a bunch of different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's no matter how you,</v>

1472
01:01:12.310 --> 01:01:14.370
<v Speaker 2>depending how you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a different</v>

1473
01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:19.440
<v Speaker 8>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I really liked how there was so much </v>

1474
01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:20.160
<v Speaker 8>detail too because I've noticed this on </v>
<v Speaker 8>past hallucinate trips before,</v>

1475
01:01:20.161 --> 01:01:25.161
<v Speaker 8>like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like little things like after he was </v>

1476
01:01:25.161 --> 01:01:25.161
<v Speaker 8>tripping,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like he shut this door and the door kind</v>

1477
01:01:25.161 --> 01:01:27.030
<v Speaker 8>of have like a red pulse when he showed </v>
<v Speaker 8>it and stuff like that.</v>

1478
01:01:27.210 --> 01:01:28.830
<v Speaker 8>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what did you think about the big,</v>

1479
01:01:28.950 --> 01:01:33.950
<v Speaker 8>even at the very beginning where you </v>
<v Speaker 8>were hypnotized in a seizure where it's </v>

1480
01:01:33.950 --> 01:01:38.361
<v Speaker 8>just flashing all those logos crazy like</v>
<v Speaker 8>that happens throughout the movie and </v>

1481
01:01:38.361 --> 01:01:38.640
<v Speaker 8>some points you're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>all right,</v>

1482
01:01:38.641 --> 01:01:40.270
<v Speaker 8>they're brainwashing me right now.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is,</v>

1483
01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:43.020
<v Speaker 8>this is from the government or google.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Hey dom,</v>

<v Speaker 5>What it was.</v>

1519
01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:05.250
<v Speaker 5>And I was starving and she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you want a muffin?</v>

1520
01:03:05.251 --> 01:03:05.940

<v Speaker 4>It's an evil I heard of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I heard about a fraternity wanting all </v>

1670
01:08:57.380 --> 01:08:57.810
<v Speaker 4>these dumb fraternity price.</v>

1671
01:08:57.811 --> 01:08:59.600
<v Speaker 4>like George Mason when I was doing a </v>
<v Speaker 4>show there.</v>

1672
01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:00.200
<v Speaker 4>They go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>

1673
01:09:00.201 --> 01:09:03.800
<v Speaker 4>we got this fraternity that at the end </v>
<v Speaker 4>of hell week they,</v>

1674
01:09:03.801 --> 01:09:05.930
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they feed them spaghetti.</v>

1675
01:09:06.020 --> 01:09:11.020
<v Speaker 4>They give them this big spaghetti dinner</v>
<v Speaker 4>that the lake little sisters make for </v>

1676
01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:11.300
<v Speaker 4>them and then they feed them like </v>
<v Speaker 4>chocolate pudding,</v>

1677
01:09:11.301 --> 01:09:16.301
<v Speaker 4>but it's full of x slacks and then they </v>
<v Speaker 4>make them climb a tree and they've got </v>

1678
01:09:16.301 --> 01:09:20.921
<v Speaker 4>to spend the night in a tree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the top guy gets to go to the top </v>

1679
01:09:20.921 --> 01:09:22.610
<v Speaker 4>of the tree and all the way down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like if you're an asshole,</v>

<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just taking advantage of the people that</v>

1684
01:09:37.281 --> 01:09:40.070
<v Speaker 4>have the least amount of power and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that want the most from you.</v>

1685
01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:45.280
<v Speaker 4>The other good thing about fraternities </v>
<v Speaker 4>was going to their parties and like </v>

<v Speaker 4>to stand on actual cafeteria tables.</v>

1690
01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:01.270

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1873
01:17:06.930 --> 01:17:09.500
<v Speaker 2>it's like jay jeffrey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing that that's even an option.</v>

1874
01:17:09.501 --> 01:17:10.050
<v Speaker 2>Jim jeffrey</v>

1875
01:17:10.050 --> 01:17:13.310
<v Speaker 4>said his mom used to wake them up every </v>
<v Speaker 4>morning with a glass of orange juice and</v>

1876
01:17:13.311 --> 01:17:17.450
<v Speaker 4>ritalin and she would just open up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he said,</v>

1877
01:17:17.451 --> 01:17:22.451
<v Speaker 4>he didn't even know what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She'd just be like open up and just pop </v>

1878
01:17:22.451 --> 01:17:22.451
<v Speaker 4>them in his mouth and make them drink it</v>
<v Speaker 4>down.</v>

1879
01:17:22.451 --> 01:17:22.520
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1880
01:17:22.521 --> 01:17:27.521
<v Speaker 4>when you develop a kid incorrectly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some people are just mentally </v>

1881
01:17:27.521 --> 01:17:27.521
<v Speaker 4>imbalanced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is a fact.</v>

1882
01:17:27.521 --> 01:17:31.871
<v Speaker 4>There's some people that their hormone </v>
<v Speaker 4>levels are the chemical levels of the </v>

1883
01:17:31.871 --> 01:17:32.270
<v Speaker 4>brand or just fucked up and they do need</v>
<v Speaker 4>some help,</v>

1884
01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:35.660
<v Speaker 4>but there's other people that just were.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somebody raised them shitty,</v>

1885
01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:38.720
<v Speaker 4>just did a terrible job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>barely fucking paid attention to him and</v>

1886
01:17:38.721 --> 01:17:42.560
<v Speaker 4>the kid developed all this nutty </v>
<v Speaker 4>behavior and getting it out of someone.</v>

1887
01:17:42.650 --> 01:17:46.040
<v Speaker 4>It's way harder to get something out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

1888
01:17:46.070 --> 01:17:51.070
<v Speaker 4>Someone once it's in there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>once they've already developed some </v>

1889
01:17:51.070 --> 01:17:51.740
<v Speaker 4>wacky patterns of behavior and they have</v>
<v Speaker 4>like certain associations,</v>

1890
01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:54.680
<v Speaker 4>very difficult to get that to change,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you could just,</v>

1891
01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:59.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's way easier to raise on correctly </v>

1892
01:17:59.860 --> 01:17:59.860
<v Speaker 4>from the beginning to try to turn </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone around once they're fucked up.</v>

1893
01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:02.150
<v Speaker 4>It'S like how many people that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are a mess,</v>

1894
01:18:02.210 --> 01:18:05.210
<v Speaker 4>that have fucked up lives ever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pull it together ever.</v>

1895
01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:07.280
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever so few,</v>

1896
01:18:07.300 --> 01:18:12.300
<v Speaker 4>but so few people quit anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know a chick who used to prostitute </v>

1897
01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:15.530
<v Speaker 4>herself and she was like the nicest girl</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the world.</v>

1898
01:18:15.531 --> 01:18:18.550
<v Speaker 4>I knew two girls that kinda like went to</v>
<v Speaker 4>prostitution and they,</v>

1899
01:18:18.570 --> 01:18:23.570
<v Speaker 4>you wouldn't think either these girls,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she was doing like craig little </v>

1900
01:18:23.570 --> 01:18:25.910
<v Speaker 4>craigslist hooking and shit and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she had,</v>

1901
01:18:25.930 --> 01:18:30.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it had like the molestation thing and </v>

1902
01:18:30.930 --> 01:18:32.030
<v Speaker 4>all that fucked up stuff and she went to</v>
<v Speaker 4>therapy and jay and I said,</v>

1903
01:18:32.031 --> 01:18:34.100
<v Speaker 4>why don't you tell what your therapist </v>
<v Speaker 4>say about it?</v>

1904
01:18:34.101 --> 01:18:35.270
<v Speaker 4>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't tell them.</v>

1905
01:18:35.510 --> 01:18:36.230
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1906
01:18:36.680 --> 01:18:41.680
<v Speaker 4>you need to tell your therapist that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>were molested and all this stuff and </v>

1907
01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:45.250
<v Speaker 4>work on that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she did eventually and she's like </v>

1908
01:18:45.250 --> 01:18:46.730
<v Speaker 4>married and I think she's had in her </v>
<v Speaker 4>life is good.</v>

1909
01:18:46.850 --> 01:18:48.740
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she really is a product of like,</v>

1910

<v Speaker 4>Just you've got to be fucking goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 4>committed staying on that track.</v>

1913
01:18:57.020 --> 01:18:59.930
<v Speaker 4>You almost have to become addicted to </v>
<v Speaker 4>changing,</v>

1914
01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:05.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to like get and it has to get </v>

1915
01:19:05.060 --> 01:19:07.160
<v Speaker 4>ingrained in you so deeply after so long</v>
<v Speaker 4>a time that it actually becomes your new</v>

1916

<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>

1918

01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:06.840
<v Speaker 4>you can't even talk to a woman in a bar </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the guys have fucked them over </v>

2079

<v Speaker 4>so badly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You go up to go and be like,</v>

2083
01:25:10.511 --> 01:25:15.511
<v Speaker 4>And it's not like you did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's what the last 20 guys that dealt </v>

2084
01:25:15.511 --> 01:25:18.241
<v Speaker 4>with her did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the girls are on the defensive and </v>

2085
01:25:18.241 --> 01:25:18.241
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because the guy is just,</v>

2086
01:25:18.241 --> 01:25:20.590
<v Speaker 4>it's all about your boys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but don't they have a different attitude</v>

2087
01:25:20.591 --> 01:25:21.860
<v Speaker 4>towards sex and Australia?</v>

2088
01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:23.860
<v Speaker 4>The much more permissive?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Much more.</v>

2089
01:25:24.270 --> 01:25:26.380
<v Speaker 4>I would say there are a lot of much </v>
<v Speaker 4>musculus everywhere.</v>

2090
01:25:26.381 --> 01:25:28.420
<v Speaker 4>But America,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's one thing you don't realize about</v>

2091
01:25:28.421 --> 01:25:29.140
<v Speaker 4>America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How,</v>

2092
01:25:29.260 --> 01:25:32.500
<v Speaker 4>I mean obviously the middle east is </v>
<v Speaker 4>worse unless you're a little boy,</v>

2093
01:25:32.860 --> 01:25:33.790
<v Speaker 4>but in the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the middle east,</v>

2094
01:25:33.791 --> 01:25:35.140
<v Speaker 4>they love to fuck little boys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>

2095
01:25:35.141 --> 01:25:40.141
<v Speaker 4>that's an awesome time for them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but as far as like like european </v>

2096
01:25:40.141 --> 01:25:44.041
<v Speaker 4>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we are so fucked up in comparison to </v>

2097
01:25:44.041 --> 01:25:45.100
<v Speaker 4>them like our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our whole repression,</v>

2098
01:25:45.280 --> 01:25:46.900
<v Speaker 4>all that shit that doesn't exist over </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

2099
01:25:47.050 --> 01:25:49.090
<v Speaker 4>They're like in Argentina and south </v>
<v Speaker 4>America,</v>

2100
01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:51.730
<v Speaker 4>the commercials,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's super life hurt.</v>

2101
01:25:51.731 --> 01:25:53.230
<v Speaker 4>I've heard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how true this is.</v>

2102
01:25:53.231 --> 01:25:57.460
<v Speaker 4>I read or it was in a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a statistic in jesus camp.</v>

2103
01:25:57.490 --> 01:26:02.490
<v Speaker 4>Did you see that film?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They said two thirds of americans born </v>

2104
01:26:02.490 --> 01:26:05.251
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Christians know that's what it said in </v>

2105
01:26:05.251 --> 01:26:05.251
<v Speaker 4>the beginning of that film.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's correct.</v>

2106
01:26:05.251 --> 01:26:10.030
<v Speaker 4>I think probably two thirds of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that they talked to or </v>

2107
01:26:10.030 --> 01:26:10.030
<v Speaker 4>evangelical,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2108
01:26:10.030 --> 01:26:13.520
<v Speaker 4>finding the numbers of for $300,</v>
<v Speaker 4>million people.</v>

2109
01:26:13.521 --> 01:26:15.860
<v Speaker 4>that's so problematic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not only that,</v>

2110
01:26:15.861 --> 01:26:17.570
<v Speaker 4>you've got to add in mexicans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2111
01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:20.480
<v Speaker 4>because there's a lot of undocumented </v>
<v Speaker 4>people in this country and who knows how</v>

2112
01:26:20.481 --> 01:26:21.230
<v Speaker 4>many it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2113
01:26:21.231 --> 01:26:24.020
<v Speaker 4>I've heard millions and millions in </v>
<v Speaker 4>California alone,</v>

2114
01:26:24.021 --> 01:26:29.021
<v Speaker 4>so who knows how many it is nationwide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so knowing how many people are actually </v>

2115
01:26:29.021 --> 01:26:33.551
<v Speaker 4>christians and evangelical evangelical </v>
<v Speaker 4>christians or people who believe the </v>

2116
01:26:33.551 --> 01:26:34.250
<v Speaker 4>earth is less than 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years old.</v>

2117
01:26:34.251 --> 01:26:37.240
<v Speaker 4>You know the numbers are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who the fuck knows what they are?</v>

2118
01:26:37.250 --> 01:26:39.950
<v Speaker 4>I've heard 51 percent believed the earth</v>
<v Speaker 4>is less than 10,000</v>

2119
01:26:39.951 --> 01:26:44.951
<v Speaker 4>years old.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fifty one percent believe in a biblical </v>

2120
01:26:44.951 --> 01:26:44.951
<v Speaker 4>version of the bible that's fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

2121
01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:47.450

<v Speaker 2>I want you to go look up a bill </v>
<v Speaker 2>o'reilly,</v>

2219
01:30:43.350 --> 01:30:48.350

<v Speaker 2>a bunch of voicemails on his assistance.</v>

2220
01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:54.700
<v Speaker 2>His assistant's fallen about a rubbing </v>
<v Speaker 2>her down with a loofa sponge and fucking</v>

2221
01:30:56.390 --> 01:30:58.910
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of creepy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wound up payIng her off,</v>

2222
01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:01.830
<v Speaker 2>don't you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think that bill o'reilly's the</v>

2223
01:31:01.831 --> 01:31:05.090
<v Speaker 2>kind of guy that really needs to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>really high?</v>

2224
01:31:05.360 --> 01:31:07.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he might go,</v>

2225
01:31:08.090 --> 01:31:13.090
<v Speaker 2>holy shit back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take back almost everything I've ever </v>

2226
01:31:13.090 --> 01:31:13.610
<v Speaker 2>said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She,</v>

2227
01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:15.650
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure he would because he would allow</v>

2228
01:31:15.651 --> 01:31:20.651
<v Speaker 2>hIm a different perception that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably has never entered into if he </v>

2229
01:31:20.651 --> 01:31:21.050
<v Speaker 2>does believe that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

2230
01:31:21.051 --> 01:31:26.051
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he does or doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he does and this is why I think </v>

2231
01:31:26.051 --> 01:31:26.051
<v Speaker 2>he does.</v>

2232
01:31:26.051 --> 01:31:28.220
<v Speaker 2>I think he does because he's got a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tremendous ego and I think,</v>

2233
01:31:28.221 --> 01:31:30.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's one of those guys that he's,</v>

2234
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:35.470
<v Speaker 2>he's saying something all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you would say something </v>

2235
01:31:35.470 --> 01:31:36.230
<v Speaker 2>all the time unless he believed it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2236
01:31:36.231 --> 01:31:37.070
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this whole thing.</v>

2237
01:31:37.071 --> 01:31:38.270
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2238
01:31:38.271 --> 01:31:41.120
<v Speaker 2>I think he's definitely preaching to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>choir and I definitely think he's,</v>

2239
01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:42.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to fit a,</v>

2240
01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:46.040
<v Speaker 2>fit a mold and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and trying to appease his constituents,</v>

2241
01:31:46.041 --> 01:31:48.800
<v Speaker 2>all the people that listen to his show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think there's,</v>

2242
01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:53.920
<v Speaker 2>it can't be contrary to what he really </v>
<v Speaker 2>believes because he's got too big of an </v>

2243
01:31:53.920 --> 01:31:55.310
<v Speaker 2>ego for him to be on tv talking about it</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>

2244
01:31:55.460 --> 01:31:57.650
<v Speaker 2>Eventually he'd implode.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't be able to deal with that.</v>

2245
01:31:57.651 --> 01:32:00.100
<v Speaker 2>If you really did have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an intelligent</v>

2246
01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:01.900
<v Speaker 12>argument that was contrary to what we've</v>
<v Speaker 12>saying,</v>

2247
01:32:02.110 --> 01:32:03.580
<v Speaker 12>I don't think you would be saying it on </v>
<v Speaker 12>the air.</v>

2248
01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:06.310
<v Speaker 12>I just think his ego's too big.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I don't think he's that genius.</v>

2249
01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:11.400
<v Speaker 12>He's not.</v>
<v Speaker 12>He's not andy kaufman and he's not some </v>

2250
01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:11.400
<v Speaker 12>brilliant trickster that's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 12>fooling the world.</v>

2251
01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:16.500
<v Speaker 12>I think these guYs,</v>
<v Speaker 12>they start playing a character and then </v>

2252
01:32:16.500 --> 01:32:17.800
<v Speaker 12>they sort of like dice clay it.</v>
<v Speaker 12>They become the character.</v>

2253
01:32:17.801 --> 01:32:19.930
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Whatever one dice clay onto the dice.</v>

2254
01:32:19.931 --> 01:32:21.670
<v Speaker 12>Clay used to be andrew silverstein,</v>
<v Speaker 12>by the way.</v>

2255
01:32:21.671 --> 01:32:23.410

2265
01:32:42.940 --> 01:32:47.940
<v Speaker 12>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 12>he'd seen his name around dice used to </v>

2266
01:32:47.940 --> 01:32:48.070
<v Speaker 12>be a andrew silverstein and then he </v>
<v Speaker 12>would.</v>

2267
01:32:48.071 --> 01:32:53.071
<v Speaker 12>The dice man was like this character </v>
<v Speaker 12>that he would do on stage along with a </v>

2268
01:32:53.071 --> 01:32:56.731
<v Speaker 12>bunch of other characters.</v>
<v Speaker 12>He would do like stallone and he would </v>

2269
01:32:56.731 --> 01:32:56.731
<v Speaker 12>do deniro.</v>
<v Speaker 12>He would do like all these characters,</v>

2270
01:32:56.731 --> 01:32:59.260
<v Speaker 12>like all these impressions and the dice </v>
<v Speaker 12>man was one of his characters.</v>

2271
01:32:59.410 --> 01:33:04.410
<v Speaker 12>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 12>the dIce man just became his main </v>

2272
01:33:04.410 --> 01:33:07.051
<v Speaker 12>character that became his thing.</v>
<v Speaker 12>He done on stage and then it became him </v>

<v Speaker 12>Glenn Beck.</v>

2275

<v Speaker 12>retards need.</v>

2329
01:35:16.941 --> 01:35:21.941
<v Speaker 12>Because I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I don't think it takes intelligence to </v>

2330
01:35:21.941 --> 01:35:21.941
<v Speaker 12>be a manipulator.</v>
<v Speaker 12>What he's doing takes intelligence.</v>

2331
01:35:21.941 --> 01:35:26.801
<v Speaker 12>He's free balling every day.</v>

<v Speaker 12>makes sense.</v>

2335
01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:35.570
<v Speaker 12>This is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 12>But I think that those guys,</v>

2336
01:35:35.571 --> 01:35:40.571
<v Speaker 12>when they get to that position where the</v>
<v Speaker 12>extraordinary amount of success that </v>

2337

<v Speaker 12>glenn beck's houses for sale in </v>

<v Speaker 12>There's a fucking giant and it's </v>
<v Speaker 12>probably only for sale because he got a </v>

2340
01:35:49.980 --> 01:35:49.980
<v Speaker 12>bigger one.</v>

2341
01:35:49.980 --> 01:35:50.600
<v Speaker 12>you've got a bigger crazier when that </v>
<v Speaker 12>guy selling.</v>

2342
01:35:50.750 --> 01:35:55.750
<v Speaker 12>Literally every time I go to the </v>
<v Speaker 12>bookstore there's a new Glenn Beck book </v>

2343
01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:57.971
<v Speaker 12>and nobody makes me feel lazier than </v>
<v Speaker 12>glenn bUck because I've been writing </v>

2344
01:35:57.971 --> 01:36:00.440
<v Speaker 12>this god damn book for a year and I </v>
<v Speaker 12>can't ha Glenn Beck putS out one every </v>

2345
01:36:00.440 --> 01:36:01.010
<v Speaker 12>15 days.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's fucking insane,</v>

2346
01:36:01.011 --> 01:36:02.660
<v Speaker 12>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 12>But these guys,</v>

2347
01:36:02.661 --> 01:36:07.661
<v Speaker 12>I really truly believe as a person who's</v>
<v Speaker 12>been affected by fame and had been </v>

2348
01:36:08.121 --> 01:36:13.121
<v Speaker 12>affected like my war.</v>
<v Speaker 12>If I had to look at my own behavior and </v>

2349
01:36:13.121 --> 01:36:16.660
<v Speaker 12>analyze it and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>that's one of the reasons why I really </v>

2350
01:36:16.660 --> 01:36:18.851
<v Speaker 12>got into psychedelics and the,</v>
<v Speaker 12>the isolation tank is because I felt </v>

2351
01:36:18.851 --> 01:36:22.511
<v Speaker 12>like there was an overwhelming influence</v>
<v Speaker 12>that that fame and the pursuit of fame </v>

2352
01:36:22.511 --> 01:36:24.050
<v Speaker 12>has on a person,</v>
<v Speaker 12>especially in hollywood where you're,</v>

2353
01:36:24.051 --> 01:36:29.051
<v Speaker 12>you're trying to make things happen </v>
<v Speaker 12>where you can lose yourself in this </v>

2354
01:36:29.051 --> 01:36:29.570
<v Speaker 12>quest and I take it happens to a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 12>people.</v>

2355
01:36:29.750 --> 01:36:32.730
<v Speaker 12>So I wanted to kind of analyze it in </v>
<v Speaker 12>myself and,</v>

2356
01:36:32.790 --> 01:36:37.010
<v Speaker 12>and it took a long time for me to get </v>
<v Speaker 12>ahold of it from like fear factor on.</v>

2357
01:36:37.190 --> 01:36:39.470
<v Speaker 12>There was like a long time in there </v>
<v Speaker 12>where I was like,</v>

2358
01:36:39.471 --> 01:36:44.471
<v Speaker 12>this is a crazy thing here.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Like how do you make sure that what </v>

2359
01:36:44.471 --> 01:36:44.471
<v Speaker 12>you're doing is really what you want to </v>
<v Speaker 12>be doing?</v>

2360
01:36:44.471 --> 01:36:44.660
<v Speaker 12>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 12>how do you,</v>

2361
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:49.870
<v Speaker 12>how do you know that you know what </v>
<v Speaker 12>you're doing is not what you think </v>

2362
01:36:49.870 --> 01:36:51.260
<v Speaker 12>people would like to hear from you or </v>
<v Speaker 12>what you think is gonna you're gonna say</v>

2363
01:36:51.261 --> 01:36:54.050
<v Speaker 12>and do to get more work and to get more </v>
<v Speaker 12>people to like you.</v>

2364
01:36:54.310 --> 01:36:59.310
<v Speaker 12>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I've had conversatIons with really </v>

2365
01:36:59.310 --> 01:36:59.310
<v Speaker 12>successful people.</v>
<v Speaker 12>They say,</v>

2366
01:36:59.310 --> 01:37:02.650
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I can't do that because I'm this and </v>

2367
01:37:02.650 --> 01:37:02.650
<v Speaker 12>that and my image is that and this and </v>
<v Speaker 12>like,</v>

2368
01:37:02.650 --> 01:37:02.650
<v Speaker 12>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you're,</v>

2369
01:37:02.650 --> 01:37:07.121
<v Speaker 12>you're not even doing you,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you're pretending to be something else </v>

2370
01:37:07.121 --> 01:37:08.690
<v Speaker 12>just so that you can get more of the </v>
<v Speaker 12>positive reaction that you've gotten.</v>

2371
01:37:08.960 --> 01:37:10.910
<v Speaker 12>That permeates into your real life,</v>

2372
01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:12.520
<v Speaker 8>but what if,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what if that's like,</v>

2373
01:37:13.140 --> 01:37:15.090
<v Speaker 8>like I'm the kind of person I vacillate.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Often I'll,</v>

2374
01:37:15.130 --> 01:37:20.130
<v Speaker 8>I'll look at one thing and then all have</v>
<v Speaker 8>a different opinion maybe a year later </v>

2375
01:37:20.130 --> 01:37:22.720
<v Speaker 8>on how I felt about it and been in the </v>
<v Speaker 8>seat and as a,</v>

2376
01:37:22.770 --> 01:37:24.340
<v Speaker 8>as a performer,</v>
<v Speaker 8>as a comedian,</v>

2377
01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:27.880
<v Speaker 8>my ax constantly changing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Sometimes I can't do bits that I used to</v>

2378
01:37:27.881 --> 01:37:32.881
<v Speaker 8>do because I've changed as a person.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't feel that way and I can't </v>

2379
01:37:32.881 --> 01:37:36.001
<v Speaker 8>deliver them with truth and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that would suck to fucking be locked </v>

2380
01:37:36.001 --> 01:37:40.320
<v Speaker 8>into accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We're off air Says we're off the air use</v>

2381
01:37:40.430 --> 01:37:42.580
<v Speaker 8>drink keeps on fucking up,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it's on here.</v>

2382
01:37:42.581 --> 01:37:45.850
<v Speaker 8>It says we're on here,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so it's going off and on and it's choppy</v>

2383
01:37:45.851 --> 01:37:47.830
<v Speaker 8>for people,</v>

<v Speaker 5>the ability to like change while you're </v>

2396
01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:16.630
<v Speaker 5>and to get locked into that character </v>
<v Speaker 5>would be terrifying for me.</v>

2397
01:38:16.631 --> 01:38:20.080
<v Speaker 5>I'm a control freak and if that's where </v>
<v Speaker 5>your income and I don't have the,</v>

2398
01:38:20.680 --> 01:38:25.680
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm lucky enough that I don't have like </v>

2399
01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:27.101
<v Speaker 5>a life and kids.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But imagine if you got into that where </v>

2400
01:38:27.101 --> 01:38:27.880
<v Speaker 5>then you've got a house and mortgages </v>
<v Speaker 5>and schools and you've,</v>

2401
01:38:27.970 --> 01:38:32.970
<v Speaker 5>you've bought into this character and </v>
<v Speaker 5>all of a sudden you've changed as a </v>

2402
01:38:32.970 --> 01:38:32.970
<v Speaker 5>character and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fuck,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I'm not that guy anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't feel that way.</v>

2404
01:38:33.851 --> 01:38:35.530
<v Speaker 5>I've changed my way of thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but fuck,</v>

2405
01:38:35.531 --> 01:38:37.990
<v Speaker 5>I gotta I gotta still do that because </v>
<v Speaker 5>people do change.</v>

2406
01:38:37.991 --> 01:38:41.290
<v Speaker 5>People either become more conservatIve </v>
<v Speaker 5>as they get older or you know,</v>

2407
01:38:41.350 --> 01:38:43.090
<v Speaker 5>start to realize shit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2408
01:38:43.091 --> 01:38:45.510
<v Speaker 5>I've become more liberal as I get older.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

2409
01:38:46.060 --> 01:38:46.570
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2410
01:38:46.571 --> 01:38:48.940
<v Speaker 2>I think as you become more intelligent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2411
01:38:48.941 --> 01:38:53.070
<v Speaker 2>you realize that there's a lot more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot more to things than people</v>

2412
01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:53.900
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

2413
01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:55.150
<v Speaker 2>Everybody likes to think it's black and </v>
<v Speaker 2>white.</v>

2414
01:38:55.151 --> 01:38:58.600
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of conservative now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them about gun control,</v>

2415
01:38:58.601 --> 01:38:59.140
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2416
01:38:59.150 --> 01:39:01.030

<v Speaker 2>about a lot of different things.</v>

2417
01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:03.520
<v Speaker 2>But I also have a lot of liberal points </v>
<v Speaker 2>of view to,</v>

2418
01:39:03.580 --> 01:39:08.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when it comes to things like </v>

2419
01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:08.580
<v Speaker 2>gay marriage and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2420
01:39:08.580 --> 01:39:10.180
<v Speaker 2>and that to me is one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>frustrating things when I see people get</v>

2421
01:39:10.181 --> 01:39:11.670
<v Speaker 2>upset about gay marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>be gay.</v>

2424

2497
01:42:03.481 --> 01:42:03.481
<v Speaker 4>the birth of the universe is and how do </v>
<v Speaker 4>you mean?</v>

2498
01:42:03.481 --> 01:42:05.950
<v Speaker 4>How do we not know that there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that's far more comp?</v>

2499
01:42:05.951 --> 01:42:07.540
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that there's a guy in the</v>

2500
01:42:07.541 --> 01:42:10.270
<v Speaker 4>clouds with a harp,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what I am saying is it after smoking</v>

2501
01:42:10.271 --> 01:42:15.271
<v Speaker 4>dmt seven times and doing mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the times I've done and all the </v>

2502
01:42:15.271 --> 01:42:19.051
<v Speaker 4>times in the isolation tank,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen shit way crazier than a dude </v>

2503
01:42:19.051 --> 01:42:19.660
<v Speaker 4>with a harp and the clouds.</v>

2504
01:42:19.660 --> 01:42:21.160
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I've seen it many,</v>

2505
01:42:21.161 --> 01:42:22.060
<v Speaker 4>many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many times.</v>

2506
01:42:22.100 --> 01:42:27.100
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that the idea that you can tell </v>

2507
01:42:27.100 --> 01:42:28.180
<v Speaker 4>me what does and doesn't exist is </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking ridiculous.</v>

2508
01:42:28.181 --> 01:42:30.610
<v Speaker 4>I cannot believe people actually try to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do that.</v>

2509
01:42:30.611 --> 01:42:35.611
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do we know that we're here right </v>

2510
01:42:35.611 --> 01:42:35.611
<v Speaker 4>now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or that were,</v>

2511
01:42:35.611 --> 01:42:37.720
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there could be something so complex.</v>

2512
01:42:37.870 --> 01:42:39.790
<v Speaker 4>I always tell people when they go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's your belief on god?</v>

2513
01:42:39.791 --> 01:42:42.910
<v Speaker 4>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when my dog looks at my computer,</v>

2514
01:42:42.911 --> 01:42:47.911
<v Speaker 4>my mac book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she can't comprehend the operating </v>

2515
01:42:47.911 --> 01:42:47.911
<v Speaker 4>system she has.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2516
01:42:47.911 --> 01:42:50.920
<v Speaker 4>She does not have the capability.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I believe that as humans,</v>

2517
01:42:51.130 --> 01:42:55.150
<v Speaker 4>that's how we are with the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't have the fucking capability,</v>

2518
01:42:55.270 --> 01:42:57.220
<v Speaker 4>we might be the most intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 4>species,</v>

2519
01:42:57.370 --> 01:43:01.600
<v Speaker 4>but we're not intelligent enough to </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand something that's doesn't mean</v>

2520
01:43:01.601 --> 01:43:03.880
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like being the baddest worm.</v>

2521
01:43:03.940 --> 01:43:07.480
<v Speaker 4>This worm is so smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He knows how to get around this pebble,</v>

2522
01:43:07.740 --> 01:43:08.500
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really,</v>

2523
01:43:08.510 --> 01:43:09.460
<v Speaker 4>it's ridiculous.</v>

2524
01:43:09.460 --> 01:43:10.630
<v Speaker 4>The idea that we can figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2525
01:43:10.631 --> 01:43:15.631
<v Speaker 4>this is complete and total stoner talk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the idea that we can figure out the </v>

2526
01:43:15.631 --> 01:43:16.030
<v Speaker 4>fucking universe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

2527

2532
01:43:26.711 --> 01:43:29.860
<v Speaker 4>but it just kind of talked about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did they have the transcriptions though?</v>

<v Speaker 12>So I had all this tension that I didn't </v>

2837
01:55:51.830 --> 01:55:51.830
<v Speaker 12>know how to deal with,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

2838

<v Speaker 12>like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 12>my,</v>

2839
01:55:52.750 --> 01:55:54.760
<v Speaker 12>my whole body from the time I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

2840
01:55:54.810 --> 01:55:58.440
<v Speaker 12>14 years old to the time I was,</v>
<v Speaker 12>this was happening when I was 22 or 23,</v>

2841
01:55:58.590 --> 01:56:03.270
<v Speaker 12>my body had been designed just to </v>
<v Speaker 12>fucking to constantly be working,</v>

2842
01:56:03.300 --> 01:56:08.300
<v Speaker 12>constantly be exerting all this energy,</v>
<v Speaker 12>whether it's in kickboxing or wrestling </v>

2843
01:56:08.300 --> 01:56:08.300
<v Speaker 12>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 12>There was like,</v>

2844
01:56:08.300 --> 01:56:13.170
<v Speaker 12>there's this constant.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Then that was the only way I coped with </v>

2845
01:56:13.170 --> 01:56:13.210
<v Speaker 12>stress that was gone.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 12>from boston to New York.</v>

01:56:19.410 --> 01:56:20.820
<v Speaker 12>I have no friends.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I don't know anybody there.</v>

2849
01:56:20.821 --> 01:56:22.560
<v Speaker 12>I'm living with my grandfather and my </v>
<v Speaker 12>grandmother.</v>

2850
01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:25.200
<v Speaker 12>My grandmother was dying of an aneurysm.</v>
<v Speaker 12>She had an aneurysm.</v>

2851
01:56:25.201 --> 01:56:27.810
<v Speaker 12>They gave her 72 hours to live.</v>
<v Speaker 12>She lived for 12 years.</v>

2852
01:56:28.100 --> 01:56:33.100
<v Speaker 12>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And I'm staying in their old house that </v>

2853
01:56:33.100 --> 01:56:33.100
<v Speaker 12>they bought in 1945 and north New </v>
<v Speaker 12>Jersey,</v>

2854
01:56:33.100 --> 01:56:34.630
<v Speaker 12>which is now in a war zone.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I mean,</v>

2855
01:56:34.860 --> 01:56:39.860
<v Speaker 12>while I'm there,</v>
<v Speaker 12>the next door neighbor's door gets </v>

2856
01:56:39.860 --> 01:56:39.860
<v Speaker 12>broken down with a battering ram.</v>
<v Speaker 12>They arrest him for selling crack.</v>

2857
01:56:39.860 --> 01:56:40.920
<v Speaker 12>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 12>no joke,</v>

2858
01:56:40.921 --> 01:56:42.120
<v Speaker 12>man.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It was a scary,</v>

2859
01:56:42.121 --> 01:56:43.920
<v Speaker 12>scary neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It used to be an italian neighborhood.</v>

2860
01:56:43.921 --> 01:56:48.921
<v Speaker 12>Then it went just total total chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So I'm staying in the house and my </v>

2861
01:56:48.921 --> 01:56:48.921
<v Speaker 12>grandma,</v>
<v Speaker 12>like,</v>

2862
01:56:48.921 --> 01:56:49.470
<v Speaker 12>she,</v>
<v Speaker 12>she,</v>

2863
01:56:49.650 --> 01:56:51.360
<v Speaker 12>she died.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Both of them are dead now,</v>

2864
01:56:51.510 --> 01:56:53.970
<v Speaker 12>but back then she um,</v>
<v Speaker 12>she couldn't move.</v>

2865
01:56:53.971 --> 01:56:58.971
<v Speaker 12>She was completely paralyzed.</v>
<v Speaker 12>She would get bedsores and she could </v>

2866
01:56:58.971 --> 01:57:01.881
<v Speaker 12>feel some things and sometimes she would</v>
<v Speaker 12>just let out these soul,</v>

2867
01:57:02.670 --> 01:57:07.670
<v Speaker 12>like almost like she was emptying </v>
<v Speaker 12>herself of the pain and the only way to </v>

2868
01:57:08.611 --> 01:57:11.250
<v Speaker 12>do it was to let out this horrible </v>
<v Speaker 12>screech.</v>

2869
01:57:11.490 --> 01:57:14.070
<v Speaker 12>So I'd be in the house and I'd be like </v>
<v Speaker 12>wandering around,</v>

2870
01:57:14.071 --> 01:57:15.700
<v Speaker 12>maybe I go to the kitchen and grab </v>
<v Speaker 12>something to eat.</v>

2871
01:57:15.701 --> 01:57:16.020
<v Speaker 12>And here</v>

2872
01:57:20.220 --> 01:57:23.070
<v Speaker 12>it was like an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 12>like a wounded animal.</v>

2873
01:57:23.071 --> 01:57:24.510
<v Speaker 12>She couldn't die.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It just,</v>

2874
01:57:24.720 --> 01:57:29.720
<v Speaker 12>she was so resilient.</v>
<v Speaker 12>She had those italian peasant jeans and </v>

2875
01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:33.621
<v Speaker 12>she was just so fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 12>but yet she hung in there for like 12 </v>

2876
01:57:33.621 --> 01:57:33.621
<v Speaker 12>years.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So I'm living in this house.</v>

2877
01:57:33.621 --> 01:57:38.001
<v Speaker 12>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And I'd just broken up with my </v>

2878
01:57:38.001 --> 01:57:38.001
<v Speaker 12>girlfriend and my manager,</v>
<v Speaker 12>god bless him,</v>

2879
01:57:38.001 --> 01:57:42.320
<v Speaker 12>great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 12>But it was back in the day where we </v>

2880
01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:44.061
<v Speaker 12>talked about like,</v>
<v Speaker 12>when you're not doing so well then </v>

2881
01:57:44.061 --> 01:57:45.951
<v Speaker 12>everybody has advice for you.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And his advice was you should dress </v>

2882

<v Speaker 12>nice belt and like a club shirt that you</v>

2886

<v Speaker 12>would go out clubbing.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And I had a nice head of hair back then.</v>

<v Speaker 12>It was delicious and I'm wearing shiny </v>
<v Speaker 12>shoes and shit.</v>

01:57:59.490 --> 01:58:03.180
<v Speaker 12>And I just looked like the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 12>biggest asshole.</v>

2889

<v Speaker 12>I just looked like some club,</v>

<v Speaker 5>the worst bombing ever.</v>

<v Speaker 5>the heat that goes through your body </v>

2925
01:59:23.130 --> 01:59:23.130
<v Speaker 5>when you're bombing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's like,</v>

2926
01:59:23.130 --> 01:59:23.710
<v Speaker 5>people don't understand when you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>bombing,</v>

01:59:24.040 --> 01:59:26.470
<v Speaker 5>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a hot flash.</v>

2928
01:59:26.500 --> 01:59:28.750
<v Speaker 5>You almost get hot flashes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'm having it.</v>

2929
01:59:28.751 --> 01:59:30.310
<v Speaker 5>When the guy through the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2930
01:59:30.720 --> 01:59:31.270
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2931
01:59:31.630 --> 01:59:34.600
<v Speaker 5>that knocked me out of my aggression.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When the chair came up onto the stage,</v>

2932
01:59:34.601 --> 01:59:35.620
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2933
01:59:35.621 --> 01:59:38.290
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to fight a crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>I was supposed to do like 40 minutes and</v>

2937
01:59:49.781 --> 01:59:53.560
<v Speaker 5>I think I'm at 45 seconds or something </v>
<v Speaker 5>or four minutes.</v>

2938
01:59:53.561 --> 01:59:54.850
<v Speaker 5>I forget.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was so short.</v>

<v Speaker 5>She's going to get off,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get off.</v>

<v Speaker 12>joey?</v>

3060
02:04:53.400 --> 02:04:55.050
<v Speaker 12>I mean it's like a cartoon.</v>
<v Speaker 12>He's just,</v>

3061
02:04:55.051 --> 02:04:57.790
<v Speaker 12>he's just explosive with energy.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Just makes you happy.</v>

3062
02:04:57.791 --> 02:04:58.980
<v Speaker 12>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 12>He just ridiculous.</v>

3063
02:04:58.981 --> 02:05:01.490
<v Speaker 12>It makes you funny or two.</v>
<v Speaker 12>He makes me funnier and funnier with our</v>

3064
02:05:01.491 --> 02:05:02.800
<v Speaker 12>work with joe.</v>
<v Speaker 12>That's how I feel better.</v>

3065
02:05:02.801 --> 02:05:05.460
<v Speaker 12>And that's how Brian Mccarthy,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I feel the same way.</v>

3066
02:05:05.880 --> 02:05:08.370
<v Speaker 12>But what you said,</v>
<v Speaker 12>like I saw dave chappelle once at the,</v>

3067
02:05:08.371 --> 02:05:09.840
<v Speaker 12>at the comedy store and I felt the same </v>
<v Speaker 12>way.</v>

3068
02:05:09.841 --> 02:05:10.680
<v Speaker 12>I want to go home and write.</v>

3069
02:05:10.890 --> 02:05:12.690
<v Speaker 12>I'm totally inspired by great comics </v>
<v Speaker 12>too.</v>

3070
02:05:12.691 --> 02:05:14.520
<v Speaker 12>Like I saw louis at the,</v>
<v Speaker 12>um,</v>

3071
02:05:14.670 --> 02:05:19.670
<v Speaker 12>at the improv and hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 12>lucy kay and I wanted to go home and </v>

3072
02:05:19.670 --> 02:05:21.951
<v Speaker 12>write.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It was really great performance in </v>

3073
02:05:21.951 --> 02:05:22.170
<v Speaker 12>norton recently I saw norton at the cap </v>
<v Speaker 12>city and austin fucking great.</v>

3074
02:05:22.171 --> 02:05:23.670
<v Speaker 12>And that same feeling I want to go </v>
<v Speaker 12>right.</v>

3075
02:05:24.060 --> 02:05:27.120
<v Speaker 12>But I also get inspired by people who </v>
<v Speaker 12>don't like me.</v>

3076
02:05:28.110 --> 02:05:29.370
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Even fucking,</v>

3077
02:05:29.371 --> 02:05:30.500
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>haters online.</v>

3078
02:05:30.720 --> 02:05:35.720
<v Speaker 12>I can get a million people who love me.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Dude is the greatest fucking show I've </v>

3079
02:05:35.720 --> 02:05:35.720
<v Speaker 12>ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Some amazing.</v>

3080
02:05:35.720 --> 02:05:38.370
<v Speaker 12>And one person who's like,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

3081
02:05:38.400 --> 02:05:40.080
<v Speaker 12>fucking hang it up,</v>
<v Speaker 12>streak two ufc.</v>

3082
02:05:40.110 --> 02:05:41.460
<v Speaker 12>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 12>what bitch,</v>

3083
02:05:41.520 --> 02:05:42.360
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'll get,</v>

3084
02:05:42.570 --> 02:05:44.720
<v Speaker 12>I'll get like fired up to.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I have to zone them,</v>

3085
02:05:44.730 --> 02:05:46.710
<v Speaker 12>work harder.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It gets good to zone them out.</v>

3086
02:05:46.711 --> 02:05:48.990
<v Speaker 12>But it's good to be humble.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I really believe.</v>

3087
02:05:49.010 --> 02:05:54.010
<v Speaker 12>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it's a bad feeling to have someone </v>

3088
02:05:54.010 --> 02:05:54.010
<v Speaker 12>negatively critique your work.</v>

3089
02:05:54.010 --> 02:05:57.290
<v Speaker 12>It's a terrible feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 12>but I think there's something to it </v>

3090
02:05:57.290 --> 02:05:58.530
<v Speaker 12>that's good for an artist.</v>
<v Speaker 12>There's something that keeps you sort of</v>

3091
02:05:58.531 --> 02:06:03.531
<v Speaker 12>humble and balanced,</v>
<v Speaker 12>especially in this either direct </v>

3092
02:06:03.531 --> 02:06:04.650
<v Speaker 12>adulation relationship that you have </v>
<v Speaker 12>with an audience.</v>

3093
02:06:04.651 --> 02:06:06.780
<v Speaker 12>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you're immediately giving them what they</v>

3094
02:06:06.781 --> 02:06:11.781
<v Speaker 12>want to hear and they immediately laugh </v>
<v Speaker 12>and they tell you how much they love </v>

3095
02:06:11.781 --> 02:06:11.781
<v Speaker 12>you.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I mean,</v>

3096
02:06:11.781 --> 02:06:11.820
<v Speaker 12>you can get imbalanced by that.</v>
<v Speaker 12>You can get lazy.</v>

3097
02:06:11.821 --> 02:06:16.821
<v Speaker 12>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 12>we both know comics had got fucking </v>

3098
02:06:16.821 --> 02:06:18.770
<v Speaker 12>super,</v>
<v Speaker 12>super lazy and one of the reasons is </v>

3099
02:06:18.770 --> 02:06:18.770
<v Speaker 12>like,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

3100
02:06:18.770 --> 02:06:18.900
<v Speaker 12>they're not for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 12>there's not,</v>

3101
02:06:18.930 --> 02:06:20.340
<v Speaker 12>there's not enough balance.</v>
<v Speaker 12>You know,</v>

3102
02:06:20.341 --> 02:06:25.341
<v Speaker 12>they just got to a point where it was </v>
<v Speaker 12>too easy for them to many people being </v>

3103
02:06:25.341 --> 02:06:26.190
<v Speaker 12>nice to them and they just,</v>
<v Speaker 12>they lose it.</v>

3104
02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:31.240
<v Speaker 12>Know chris rock once had a really </v>
<v Speaker 12>important thing that I read where he's </v>

3105
02:06:31.240 --> 02:06:31.240
<v Speaker 12>talking about how he bombed really hard.</v>

3106
02:06:31.240 --> 02:06:33.720
<v Speaker 12>What's going on after martin Lawrence </v>

<v Speaker 12>in my career and one of the things that </v>

<v Speaker 12>This thing's crazy.</v>

3126
02:07:23.670 --> 02:07:26.670
<v Speaker 12>And martin would just devastate the main</v>
<v Speaker 12>room.</v>

3127
02:07:26.671 --> 02:07:29.460
<v Speaker 12>I mean devastate when martin lawrence </v>
<v Speaker 12>was in his prime,</v>

3128
02:07:29.610 --> 02:07:33.270
<v Speaker 12>that guy does not get enough respect </v>
<v Speaker 12>because if you go back and watch some of</v>

3129
02:07:33.271 --> 02:07:36.190
<v Speaker 12>his old standup,</v>
<v Speaker 12>he's just fucking</v>

3130
02:07:36.190 --> 02:07:37.420
<v Speaker 4>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that show,</v>

3131
02:07:37.421 --> 02:07:41.080
<v Speaker 4>martin do that shows that the writing </v>
<v Speaker 4>was like nonexistent,</v>

3132
02:07:41.230 --> 02:07:46.230
<v Speaker 4>but he carried the whole show with all </v>
<v Speaker 4>his characters and he pretended to be </v>

3133
02:07:46.230 --> 02:07:47.530
<v Speaker 4>women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's fucking funny.</v>

3134
02:07:47.980 --> 02:07:50.260
<v Speaker 4>I would be a backstage st just like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>brewer night.</v>

3135
02:07:50.261 --> 02:07:52.030
<v Speaker 4>I mean at least I had been past the </v>
<v Speaker 4>brewer thing.</v>

3136
02:07:52.031 --> 02:07:53.740
<v Speaker 4>Like it happened like a couple years </v>
<v Speaker 4>before that.</v>

3137
02:07:53.920 --> 02:07:58.920
<v Speaker 4>So I had recovered and I knew how to </v>
<v Speaker 4>like get out of the gate strong because </v>

3138
02:07:58.920 --> 02:07:59.020
<v Speaker 4>90 percent black audience,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3139
02:07:59.440 --> 02:08:04.440
<v Speaker 4>and I'm just ready to go on after him </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's crushing and then he's like,</v>

3140
02:08:04.901 --> 02:08:06.010
<v Speaker 4>who's coming up next?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3141
02:08:06.011 --> 02:08:08.500
<v Speaker 4>he has to bring me up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So martin lawrence brings me up,</v>

3142
02:08:08.710 --> 02:08:10.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he calls over to the piano guy.</v>

3143
02:08:10.480 --> 02:08:12.400
<v Speaker 4>Piano guy says joe rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>

3144
02:08:12.401 --> 02:08:14.170
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>y'all give it up for this next comedian,</v>

3145
02:08:14.171 --> 02:08:16.140
<v Speaker 4>mr joe rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very nice guy says,</v>

3146
02:08:16.270 --> 02:08:19.270
<v Speaker 4>and I just go up and eat a bag of shit </v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

3147
02:08:19.270 --> 02:08:22.420
<v Speaker 4>Just a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a big manure bag that you would buy like</v>

3148
02:08:22.421 --> 02:08:25.450
<v Speaker 4>at a fucking farm depot know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just filled with shit.</v>

3149
02:08:25.451 --> 02:08:29.050
<v Speaker 4>I'm just chilling and people are getting</v>
<v Speaker 4>up in droves and leaving.</v>

3150
02:08:29.290 --> 02:08:34.290
<v Speaker 4>But all that stuff makes you way better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes you a way better comic because </v>

3151
02:08:34.290 --> 02:08:35.170
<v Speaker 4>you realize you don't ever want to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>that feel,</v>

3152
02:08:35.171 --> 02:08:40.171
<v Speaker 4>that feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you feel the fire behind your </v>

3153
02:08:40.171 --> 02:08:42.841
<v Speaker 4>feet and it makes you run faster.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you're only going to run a certain </v>

3154
02:08:42.841 --> 02:08:42.841
<v Speaker 4>amount when you're not pushed that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3155
02:08:42.970 --> 02:08:45.320
<v Speaker 4>I feel like it's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you said,</v>

3156
02:08:45.340 --> 02:08:46.630
<v Speaker 4>sometimes I just go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm shit,</v>

3157
02:08:46.631 --> 02:08:47.890
<v Speaker 4>I suck now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blah blah blah.</v>

3158
02:08:48.190 --> 02:08:52.360
<v Speaker 4>But I don't realize that I don't have </v>
<v Speaker 4>the ability to bomb like that anymore.</v>

3159
02:08:52.570 --> 02:08:54.730
<v Speaker 4>I mean it can happen in a bad situation </v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

3160
02:08:54.731 --> 02:08:56.500
<v Speaker 4>Like something really fucked up </v>
<v Speaker 4>happening.</v>

3161
02:08:57.010 --> 02:09:01.060
<v Speaker 4>But like I used to have to New York,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3162
02:09:01.061 --> 02:09:02.920
<v Speaker 4>million times sde used to the seller.</v>

3163
02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:05.290
<v Speaker 4>She just wait and put you up after the </v>
<v Speaker 4>hardest person to,</v>

3164
02:09:05.350 --> 02:09:07.330
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to make sure you were ready for it.</v>

3165
02:09:07.350 --> 02:09:10.860
<v Speaker 4>I had to tell forever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every night in the cellar and that's all</v>

3166
02:09:10.861 --> 02:09:15.861
<v Speaker 4>I got so dark because patel would just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His jokes were so amazing and so dark to</v>

3167
02:09:17.681 --> 02:09:22.681
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like I had to go to a darker </v>

3168
02:09:22.681 --> 02:09:23.540
<v Speaker 4>place than him pick up the frequency </v>
<v Speaker 4>where he leaves.</v>

3169
02:09:23.860 --> 02:09:27.610
<v Speaker 4>And I remember just bombing so bad in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the seller that I would just start,</v>

3170
02:09:27.640 --> 02:09:32.370
<v Speaker 4>start just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the fucking freestyling,</v>

3171
02:09:32.410 --> 02:09:37.410
<v Speaker 4>just saying the worst things I could say</v>
<v Speaker 4>like talking about killing babies and </v>

3172
02:09:37.410 --> 02:09:41.161
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like trying to get out of this horrible </v>

3173
02:09:41.161 --> 02:09:41.890
<v Speaker 4>that I would just shock the fuck out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the audience and it never works.</v>

3174
02:09:41.980 --> 02:09:43.550
<v Speaker 4>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that never worked.</v>

3175
02:09:43.570 --> 02:09:46.150
<v Speaker 4>It was almost like if you go into a zone</v>
<v Speaker 4>though of like,</v>

3176
02:09:46.300 --> 02:09:51.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to pretend like they're not </v>
<v Speaker 4>here and I'm just going to just keep </v>

3177
02:09:51.300 --> 02:09:53.701
<v Speaker 4>saying this shit and hopefully they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to come around because this is so </v>

3178
02:09:53.701 --> 02:09:53.701
<v Speaker 4>painful.</v>

3179
02:09:53.701 --> 02:09:54.280
<v Speaker 4>I'm in this terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 4>terrible bomb.</v>

3180
02:09:54.520 --> 02:09:57.040
<v Speaker 4>But I mean I had,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I watched you on,</v>

3181
02:09:57.041 --> 02:09:57.910
<v Speaker 4>what was it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

3182
02:09:57.920 --> 02:09:59.800
<v Speaker 4>any evening at the caroline's comedy </v>
<v Speaker 4>hour.</v>

3183
02:09:59.801 --> 02:10:01.830
<v Speaker 4>That's where I saw you first when I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a little kid.</v>

3184
02:10:01.890 --> 02:10:06.890
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even do comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I'm like watching you and you were </v>

3185
02:10:06.890 --> 02:10:09.781
<v Speaker 4>dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember you and sarah were on it and </v>

3186
02:10:09.781 --> 02:10:09.781
<v Speaker 4>sarah was dirty and so he's a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>kid.</v>

3187
02:10:09.781 --> 02:10:10.520
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these are good comics.</v>

3188
02:10:10.570 --> 02:10:12.460
<v Speaker 4>These two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these are convenient.</v>

3189
02:10:12.461 --> 02:10:17.461
<v Speaker 4>It was so hard for me back then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They even come up with seven minutes of </v>

3190
02:10:17.461 --> 02:10:20.071
<v Speaker 4>material that I could do on tv.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would have to sit down and go over my </v>

3191
02:10:20.071 --> 02:10:20.071
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

3192
02:10:20.071 --> 02:10:20.380
<v Speaker 4>god,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't do that bit.</v>

3193
02:10:20.381 --> 02:10:25.381
<v Speaker 4>I can't do this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I might have had an hour of </v>

3194
02:10:25.381 --> 02:10:25.381
<v Speaker 4>material.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might have had five.</v>

3195
02:10:25.381 --> 02:10:28.321
<v Speaker 4>I could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't imagine you bombing because </v>

3196
02:10:28.321 --> 02:10:30.931
<v Speaker 4>of the way your act was like you had the</v>
<v Speaker 4>competence and the dirtiness and </v>

3197
02:10:30.931 --> 02:10:30.931
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>

3198
02:10:30.931 --> 02:10:31.660
<v Speaker 4>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy can't bomb.</v>

3199
02:10:31.661 --> 02:10:36.661
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you probably a lot less bombs than </v>

3200
02:10:36.661 --> 02:10:36.740
<v Speaker 4>I've had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

3201
02:10:36.980 --> 02:10:37.880
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3202
02:10:37.940 --> 02:10:38.360
<v Speaker 4>Was it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3203
02:10:38.361 --> 02:10:39.490
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've had a bunch man.</v>

3204
02:10:39.500 --> 02:10:41.300
<v Speaker 4>I don't know about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how many you've had,</v>

3205
02:10:41.301 --> 02:10:46.301
<v Speaker 4>but especially the store.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a gang of them in the early days </v>

3206
02:10:46.301 --> 02:10:46.301
<v Speaker 4>when I was going on after,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3207
02:10:46.301 --> 02:10:48.260
<v Speaker 4>like really good comics over and over </v>
<v Speaker 4>and over again.</v>

3208
02:10:48.290 --> 02:10:50.060
<v Speaker 4>I had a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a quite a few bombings.</v>

3209
02:10:50.090 --> 02:10:52.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the early days were way worse.</v>

3210
02:10:52.820 --> 02:10:57.140
<v Speaker 4>The open mic days were fucking brutal </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you're really not supposed to be</v>

3211
02:10:57.141 --> 02:10:59.390
<v Speaker 4>up there talking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you really not good enough.</v>

3212
02:10:59.450 --> 02:11:02.840
<v Speaker 4>And then look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>brian has been doing standup.</v>

3213
02:11:02.860 --> 02:11:05.840
<v Speaker 4>He's been doing open mic nights just for</v>
<v Speaker 4>a short period of time.</v>

3214
02:11:06.020 --> 02:11:10.610
<v Speaker 4>So you're in that kind of zone area </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you're learning it and figuring it</v>

3215
02:11:10.611 --> 02:11:15.611
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're in that stage of your life where </v>

3216
02:11:15.611 --> 02:11:15.611
<v Speaker 4>sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3217
02:11:15.611 --> 02:11:18.370
<v Speaker 4>I've seen you go on stage and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying out new joke and it just doesn't </v>

3218
02:11:18.370 --> 02:11:18.370
<v Speaker 4>work and you're just fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3219
02:11:18.370 --> 02:11:20.030
<v Speaker 4>you're just stuck in this rut.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3220
02:11:20.060 --> 02:11:21.290
<v Speaker 4>you're right there right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3221
02:11:21.610 --> 02:11:26.610
<v Speaker 9>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 9>I had a horrible thing the other day </v>

3222
02:11:26.610 --> 02:11:27.880
<v Speaker 9>where somebody I knew a was sitting in </v>
<v Speaker 9>the front row and they thought,</v>

<v Speaker 9>I,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

3225
02:11:29.621 --> 02:11:34.621

<v Speaker 9>I could say talk to brian while he's on </v>

3226
02:11:34.621 --> 02:11:34.621
<v Speaker 9>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 9>He said the whole time she's just like,</v>

3227
02:11:34.621 --> 02:11:38.740
<v Speaker 9>making me going like that,</v>
<v Speaker 9>or she like I said something like,</v>

<v Speaker 9>it just throws you off and I felt it.</v>

3233

<v Speaker 9>I felt I felt way off my tracks,</v>
<v Speaker 9>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>everyone tries to say that like louis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>c k will say the mean is shit to norton </v>

<v Speaker 4>It's like you're trying to get laughs </v>

3287
02:14:02.031 --> 02:14:02.031
<v Speaker 4>and someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3288
02:14:02.031 --> 02:14:06.440
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this guy has like a family and children </v>

3289
02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:06.440
<v Speaker 4>with his children read that.</v>

3290
02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:06.440
<v Speaker 4>And I went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh shit.</v>

3291
02:14:06.440 --> 02:14:06.630
<v Speaker 4>And then I thought about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

3292
02:14:06.631 --> 02:14:11.631
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even really think that I don't </v>

3293
02:14:11.631 --> 02:14:11.631
<v Speaker 4>even really believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I was really mad at myself because I</v>

3294
02:14:11.631 --> 02:14:16.401
<v Speaker 4>would have totally written a crocodile </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunter bit if it wasn't for the fact </v>

3295
02:14:16.401 --> 02:14:17.640
<v Speaker 4>that I felt bad that I wrote that I said</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

3296
02:14:17.641 --> 02:14:21.060
<v Speaker 4>which was our very short sighted and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't really even funny.</v>

3297
02:14:21.061 --> 02:14:22.830
<v Speaker 4>It was just like a quick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>easy,</v>

3298
02:14:22.831 --> 02:14:25.200
<v Speaker 4>cheap like jive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I thought about it.</v>

3299
02:14:25.201 --> 02:14:25.950
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>god damn it,</v>

3300
02:14:25.951 --> 02:14:30.951
<v Speaker 4>I fucked myself out of a good crocodile </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunter because for sure that's like </v>

3301

<v Speaker 4>by an animal,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I mean there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a fucking wealth of material </v>

3307
02:14:49.430 --> 02:14:49.430
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

3308

<v Speaker 4>but it wasn't like,</v>

<v Speaker 12>this is what you need to know and this </v>
<v Speaker 12>is some,</v>

3360
02:16:37.180 --> 02:16:40.240
<v Speaker 12>some fucking voicemail that he left from</v>
<v Speaker 12>some woman.</v>

3361
02:16:40.510 --> 02:16:45.510
<v Speaker 12>Her name was andrea charisse and she </v>
<v Speaker 12>sued him for sexual harassment and this </v>

3362
02:16:45.821 --> 02:16:49.000
<v Speaker 12>is what he goes.</v>
<v Speaker 12>You would basically be in the shower and</v>

3363
02:16:49.001 --> 02:16:54.001
<v Speaker 12>then I would come in and you would have </v>
<v Speaker 12>your back to me and I would take the </v>

3364
02:16:54.001 --> 02:16:55.210
<v Speaker 12>loofa thing and kind of soap up your </v>
<v Speaker 12>back,</v>

3365
02:16:55.330 --> 02:16:59.230
<v Speaker 12>rub it all over you,</v>
<v Speaker 12>get you to relax hot water and um,</v>

3366
02:16:59.350 --> 02:17:04.350
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you'd feel the tension drain out of you </v>

3367
02:17:04.350 --> 02:17:06.730
<v Speaker 12>and you'd still be with your back to me.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And then I would kind of put my arm.</v>

3368
02:17:07.060 --> 02:17:09.010
<v Speaker 12>It's one of those myths,</v>
<v Speaker 12>one of those loofa mints,</v>

3369
02:17:09.011 --> 02:17:14.011
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>so I got my hand in it and I would put </v>

3370
02:17:14.011 --> 02:17:14.011
<v Speaker 12>it around in front,</v>
<v Speaker 12>kind of rubbed your,</v>

3371
02:17:14.011 --> 02:17:18.361
<v Speaker 12>tell me a little bit within and then my </v>
<v Speaker 12>other hand would start to massage your </v>

3372
02:17:18.361 --> 02:17:22.080
<v Speaker 12>boobs,</v>
<v Speaker 12>get your nipples really hard because I </v>

3373
02:17:22.080 --> 02:17:22.080
<v Speaker 12>like that.</v>

3374
02:17:22.080 --> 02:17:23.620
<v Speaker 12>And you have really spectacular boobs.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So anyway,</v>

3375
02:17:23.710 --> 02:17:27.010
<v Speaker 12>I'd be rubbing your big boobs and </v>
<v Speaker 12>getting your nipples really hard,</v>

3376
02:17:27.011 --> 02:17:31.130
<v Speaker 12>kind of kissing your neck from behind.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And then the other right?</v>

3377
02:17:31.420 --> 02:17:36.420
<v Speaker 12>Yes it is.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And then I would take the other hand </v>

3378
02:17:36.420 --> 02:17:37.820
<v Speaker 12>with the falafel thing,</v>
<v Speaker 12>the falafels.</v>

3379
02:17:37.830 --> 02:17:40.980
<v Speaker 12>I don't know what that means and just </v>
<v Speaker 12>put it on your pussy and.</v>

3380
02:17:41.110 --> 02:17:46.000
<v Speaker 12>But you'd have to do it real light,</v>
<v Speaker 12>just kind of a tease business.</v>

3381
02:17:46.270 --> 02:17:49.750
<v Speaker 12>What a fucking goofy like any chick is </v>
<v Speaker 12>going to hear that and go,</v>

3382
02:17:49.751 --> 02:17:54.751

<v Speaker 12>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 12>can I choke you?</v>

<v Speaker 12>middle eastern food.</v>

3387
02:18:04.241 --> 02:18:09.241

<v Speaker 12>was sloppy with some hummus and falafel </v>

3388

<v Speaker 12>they start all of a sudden believing the</v>

3396
02:18:25.681 --> 02:18:26.860
<v Speaker 12>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 12>They believe their own hype.</v>

3397
02:18:27.190 --> 02:18:31.300
<v Speaker 12>It's step one to to losing it all like r</v>
<v Speaker 12>kelly and it's fuckin xuesong.</v>

3398
02:18:31.330 --> 02:18:31.960
<v Speaker 12>You got that bitch.</v>

3399
02:18:32.050 --> 02:18:33.100
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You want to play at the end.</v>

3400
02:18:33.560 --> 02:18:35.130
<v Speaker 5>We can cut it out the very end.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3401
02:18:35.250 --> 02:18:40.250
<v Speaker 5>let's cue it up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cue it up and we'll play it at the very </v>

3402
02:18:40.250 --> 02:18:40.250
<v Speaker 5>end.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you know the angelica houston?</v>

3403
02:18:40.250 --> 02:18:40.480
<v Speaker 5>I think he heard that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Said it.</v>

3404
02:18:40.510 --> 02:18:41.200
<v Speaker 5>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3405
02:18:41.620 --> 02:18:43.870
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I go by the motto.</v>

3406
02:18:43.871 --> 02:18:45.580
<v Speaker 5>Never pick it up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Never put it down.</v>

3407
02:18:46.030 --> 02:18:47.650
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you don't take the adulation,</v>

3408
02:18:47.710 --> 02:18:50.350
<v Speaker 5>you can't take the criticism,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like focus on yourself.</v>

3409
02:18:50.351 --> 02:18:52.330
<v Speaker 5>Don't focus on like what other people </v>
<v Speaker 5>say.</v>

3410
02:18:52.510 --> 02:18:55.390
<v Speaker 5>And I try to do that because if I can </v>
<v Speaker 5>get on people,</v>

3411
02:18:55.550 --> 02:18:57.040
<v Speaker 5>but when you walk out of a show and </v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

3412
02:18:57.041 --> 02:18:57.910
<v Speaker 5>you're great,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're great.</v>

3413
02:18:57.940 --> 02:19:02.940
<v Speaker 5>What do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's just your opinion because you're </v>

3414
02:19:02.940 --> 02:19:02.940
<v Speaker 5>going to hear you suck too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3415
02:19:02.940 --> 02:19:04.060
<v Speaker 5>And so that way I don't take the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're great.</v>

3416
02:19:04.061 --> 02:19:04.630
<v Speaker 5>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just go.</v>

3417
02:19:04.631 --> 02:19:09.631
<v Speaker 5>Oh thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I don't let it soak in because </v>

3418
02:19:09.631 --> 02:19:09.631
<v Speaker 5>otherwise</v>

3419
02:19:09.631 --> 02:19:10.020
<v Speaker 12>what I like,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I like hearing we had a great time.</v>

3420
02:19:10.980 --> 02:19:12.420
<v Speaker 12>I don't want to hear your great.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I mean,</v>

3421
02:19:12.421 --> 02:19:13.860
<v Speaker 12>if you think that.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Thank you very much.</v>

3422
02:19:13.920 --> 02:19:14.880
<v Speaker 12>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'm trying,</v>

3423
02:19:14.881 --> 02:19:16.470
<v Speaker 12>I'm working hard.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Keep going.</v>

3424
02:19:16.471 --> 02:19:19.560
<v Speaker 12>I do it all for whoever likes to see the</v>
<v Speaker 12>comedy.</v>

3425
02:19:19.561 --> 02:19:22.110
<v Speaker 12>That's what I'm doing it for.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I mean that's you,</v>

3426
02:19:22.170 --> 02:19:22.980
<v Speaker 12>I think you,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you,</v>

3427
02:19:23.010 --> 02:19:26.790
<v Speaker 12>you alter your motivation as you get </v>
<v Speaker 12>older and as you get more successful and</v>

3428
02:19:26.820 --> 02:19:29.540
<v Speaker 12>as you kind of get a better </v>
<v Speaker 12>understanding of what you're doing.</v>

3429
02:19:29.541 --> 02:19:34.541
<v Speaker 12>Like as an artist.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And I think initially I just wanted to </v>

3430
02:19:34.541 --> 02:19:34.541
<v Speaker 12>get laughs.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I just wanted to,</v>

3431
02:19:34.541 --> 02:19:38.380
<v Speaker 12>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I wanted to prove that I could be good </v>

3432
02:19:38.380 --> 02:19:38.380
<v Speaker 12>at this.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I wanted to get some success.</v>

3433
02:19:38.380 --> 02:19:38.380
<v Speaker 12>I wanted it,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I wanted to do it for me.</v>

3434
02:19:38.420 --> 02:19:40.130
<v Speaker 12>But then once you get the success,</v>
<v Speaker 12>then it has.</v>

3435
02:19:40.190 --> 02:19:41.780
<v Speaker 12>You have to change your,</v>
<v Speaker 12>your,</v>

3436
02:19:42.080 --> 02:19:46.430
<v Speaker 12>your rational or your um,</v>
<v Speaker 12>rather your motivation has to change and</v>

3437
02:19:46.431 --> 02:19:51.431
<v Speaker 12>it has to become,</v>
<v Speaker 12>in order to stay good and to stay </v>

3438
02:19:51.431 --> 02:19:52.280
<v Speaker 12>relevant you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it has to become about the art.</v>

3439
02:19:52.430 --> 02:19:54.530
<v Speaker 12>You have to be obsessed with creating </v>
<v Speaker 12>good stuff.</v>

3440
02:19:54.531 --> 02:19:59.531
<v Speaker 12>You have to be obsessed with doing </v>
<v Speaker 12>something that people are going to </v>

3441
02:19:59.531 --> 02:20:01.931
<v Speaker 12>enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Those pops of brilliance when a new bit </v>

3442
02:20:01.931 --> 02:20:01.931
<v Speaker 12>comes to light in.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Did you go through a change though?</v>

3443
02:20:01.931 --> 02:20:04.070
<v Speaker 12>Because I remember like when I watched </v>
<v Speaker 12>you when I was younger and I was like,</v>

3444
02:20:04.071 --> 02:20:07.930
<v Speaker 12>oh I liked you because at that point in </v>
<v Speaker 12>my life I was into like island here,</v>

3445
02:20:07.940 --> 02:20:11.840
<v Speaker 12>like tits and ass and fucking pussy and </v>
<v Speaker 12>that's to me you were that kind of comic</v>

3446
02:20:12.240 --> 02:20:16.700
<v Speaker 12>and evening at the improv was guys with </v>
<v Speaker 12>their sleeves rolled up going what's the</v>

3447
02:20:16.701 --> 02:20:18.230
<v Speaker 12>deal with and you,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you're gone,</v>

3448
02:20:18.231 --> 02:20:23.231
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>fuck that pussy and a while I was a </v>

3449
02:20:23.231 --> 02:20:25.631
<v Speaker 12>savage.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And then you think about how I got into </v>

3450
02:20:25.631 --> 02:20:25.631
<v Speaker 12>standup comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I was a fucking kickbox.</v>

3451
02:20:25.631 --> 02:20:29.350
<v Speaker 12>But then you changed.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Now you do this kind of intellectual </v>

3452
02:20:29.350 --> 02:20:29.450
<v Speaker 12>type material that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

3453
02:20:29.451 --> 02:20:30.800
<v Speaker 12>like what you talked about now.</v>

3454
02:20:30.920 --> 02:20:33.380
<v Speaker 12>Well when I was 21,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'm still have a million dick jokes.</v>

3455
02:20:33.381 --> 02:20:36.650
<v Speaker 12>But when I was 21 I had nothing to say </v>
<v Speaker 12>about anything else.</v>

3456
02:20:36.680 --> 02:20:39.710
<v Speaker 12>I had no opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I had no opinions on society.</v>

3457
02:20:39.820 --> 02:20:44.820
<v Speaker 12>I had no opinions on life.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I didn't think about religion at all </v>

3458
02:20:44.820 --> 02:20:45.710
<v Speaker 12>except it scared me because I went to </v>
<v Speaker 12>catholic school when I was little.</v>

3459
02:20:45.770 --> 02:20:48.200
<v Speaker 12>All I thought about when I was 21 and </v>
<v Speaker 12>was pussy,</v>

3460
02:20:48.470 --> 02:20:52.370
<v Speaker 12>that is all I was a fucking savage.</v>
<v Speaker 12>That's all I thought about.</v>

3461
02:20:52.520 --> 02:20:57.520
<v Speaker 12>I was here.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I was a former martial arts teacher and </v>

3462
02:20:57.520 --> 02:21:01.241
<v Speaker 12>fighter who is now a professional comic </v>
<v Speaker 12>and I was making my living working in </v>

3463
02:21:01.241 --> 02:21:02.510
<v Speaker 12>bars and doing standup and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 12>make girls like me.</v>

3464
02:21:02.570 --> 02:21:03.630
<v Speaker 12>I mean that's what I was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>

3465
02:21:03.660 --> 02:21:05.420
<v Speaker 12>And all I was obsessed with.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>

3466
02:21:05.421 --> 02:21:10.421
<v Speaker 12>And all I was obsessed with was fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And people would say that to me like </v>

3467
02:21:10.421 --> 02:21:10.820
<v Speaker 12>your act is all about sex and is your </v>
<v Speaker 12>act all about sex?</v>

3468
02:21:11.070 --> 02:21:16.070
<v Speaker 12>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 12>because I'm fucking 22 and my hormones </v>

3469
02:21:16.070 --> 02:21:17.860
<v Speaker 12>are blasting inside of my body,</v>
<v Speaker 12>like a broken fire hydrant,</v>

3470
02:21:18.100 --> 02:21:21.290
<v Speaker 12>slamming against the walls of my heart.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Like what are you talking about?</v>

3471
02:21:21.410 --> 02:21:23.090
<v Speaker 12>That's all I'm thinking about.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I don't know.</v>

3472
02:21:23.091 --> 02:21:25.160
<v Speaker 12>Anything else?</v>
<v Speaker 12>I had no opinions.</v>

3473
02:21:25.161 --> 02:21:28.160
<v Speaker 12>I could say sex jokes onstage and people</v>
<v Speaker 12>could laugh.</v>

3474
02:21:28.161 --> 02:21:28.790
<v Speaker 12>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 12>Why?</v>

3475
02:21:28.880 --> 02:21:31.040
<v Speaker 12>Because these are things that I was </v>
<v Speaker 12>actually thinking about.</v>

3476
02:21:31.041 --> 02:21:33.830
<v Speaker 12>So I had actual humorous points of view </v>
<v Speaker 12>on it and people would say,</v>

3477
02:21:33.831 --> 02:21:35.030
<v Speaker 12>well,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you're acting so dirty.</v>

3478
02:21:35.180 --> 02:21:37.880
<v Speaker 12>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 12>am I supposed to not talk about what I'm</v>

3479
02:21:37.881 --> 02:21:40.130
<v Speaker 12>obsessed with?</v>
<v Speaker 12>Should I talk about what you're obsessed</v>

3480
02:21:40.131 --> 02:21:40.540
<v Speaker 12>with?</v>
<v Speaker 12>I,</v>

3481
02:21:40.541 --> 02:21:44.270
<v Speaker 12>I guess I should have balanced.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It did go through a long time where,</v>

3482
02:21:44.510 --> 02:21:49.510
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>especially if I do like a half an hour </v>

3483
02:21:49.510 --> 02:21:49.510
<v Speaker 12>set,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it was too much.</v>

3484
02:21:49.510 --> 02:21:49.510
<v Speaker 12>Sex talk was like,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it was like enough already,</v>

3485
02:21:49.510 --> 02:21:49.510
<v Speaker 12>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you knew me,</v>

3486
02:21:49.510 --> 02:21:51.290
<v Speaker 12>you must have something else,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

3487
02:21:51.291 --> 02:21:53.300
<v Speaker 12>how many come shot jokes can you have,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

3488
02:21:53.301 --> 02:21:56.270
<v Speaker 12>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 12>as I got older then I started,</v>

3489
02:21:56.300 --> 02:21:58.580
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>looking at the world and you know,</v>

3490
02:21:58.820 --> 02:22:03.820
<v Speaker 12>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>actually thinking about things and then </v>

3491
02:22:03.820 --> 02:22:06.520
<v Speaker 12>actually forming opinions and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>and it can deeply considering those </v>

3492
02:22:06.520 --> 02:22:07.310
<v Speaker 12>opinions before I ever thought about </v>
<v Speaker 12>taking them to the stage.</v>

3493
02:22:07.490 --> 02:22:12.490
<v Speaker 12>And then I had opinions about things for</v>
<v Speaker 12>years and years before I ever tried to </v>

3494
02:22:12.490 --> 02:22:15.851
<v Speaker 12>like put them in a humorous situation.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's just a matter of developing as a </v>

3495
02:22:15.851 --> 02:22:17.090
<v Speaker 12>human being.</v>
<v Speaker 12>But you know,</v>

3496
02:22:17.180 --> 02:22:20.000
<v Speaker 12>as your motivation changes and as your </v>
<v Speaker 12>perception changes,</v>

3497
02:22:20.001 --> 02:22:20.570
<v Speaker 12>I mean it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you,</v>

3498
02:22:20.571 --> 02:22:22.070
<v Speaker 12>you just mature,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you grow,</v>

3499
02:22:22.071 --> 02:22:24.200
<v Speaker 12>you think about things differently.</v>
<v Speaker 12>But as your audience,</v>

3500
02:22:24.201 --> 02:22:24.860
<v Speaker 12>your,</v>
<v Speaker 12>your,</v>

3501
02:22:24.910 --> 02:22:26.190
<v Speaker 12>your ufc audience,</v>

3502
02:22:26.190 --> 02:22:29.250
<v Speaker 5>the guys that are like mma guys and like</v>
<v Speaker 5>that kind of stuff,</v>

3503
02:22:29.550 --> 02:22:33.070
<v Speaker 5>are they on the same mindset as you now </v>
<v Speaker 5>with your customers</v>

3504
02:22:33.170 --> 02:22:34.640
<v Speaker 12>cereal?</v>
<v Speaker 12>Or you'd be amazed,</v>

3505
02:22:34.730 --> 02:22:37.430
<v Speaker 12>first of all about ufc fans.</v>
<v Speaker 12>The first of all,</v>

3506
02:22:37.431 --> 02:22:42.431
<v Speaker 12>the broad spectrum of fence.</v>

<v Speaker 12>the next eight weeks.</v>

3524

3528
02:23:30.790 --> 02:23:32.450
<v Speaker 12>Well I guess people that,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

3529
02:23:32.451 --> 02:23:34.880
<v Speaker 12>everybody looks at like cage fighting </v>
<v Speaker 12>fans and they think,</v>

3530
02:23:35.020 --> 02:23:40.020
<v Speaker 12>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 12>they must be assholes with skulls on </v>

3531
02:23:40.020 --> 02:23:40.020
<v Speaker 12>their shirts.</v>
<v Speaker 12>A lot of them are,</v>

3532
02:23:40.020 --> 02:23:41.870

<v Speaker 12>assholes with skulls and their shots,</v>

<v Speaker 12>They can all be.</v>

3534
02:23:44.120 --> 02:23:46.310
<v Speaker 12>Everybody can look at things in a more </v>
<v Speaker 12>compact,</v>

3535
02:23:46.330 --> 02:23:47.260
<v Speaker 12>more fun,</v>
<v Speaker 12>friendly.</v>

3536
02:23:47.280 --> 02:23:52.280
<v Speaker 5>Well I'd imagine that like cage fighters</v>
<v Speaker 5>to themselves or kind of perfectionist </v>

3537
02:23:52.280 --> 02:23:52.800
<v Speaker 5>kind of guys.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then like,</v>

3538
02:23:52.860 --> 02:23:54.930
<v Speaker 5>what was that thing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I texted you one day and asked you about</v>

3539
02:23:54.960 --> 02:23:58.840
<v Speaker 5>the quote about if you can do one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well you can do me a moto massage you.</v>

3540
02:23:58.841 --> 02:24:03.841
<v Speaker 5>That's why I got this tattoo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>See that shit is because I find sashi </v>

3541
02:24:03.841 --> 02:24:07.221
<v Speaker 5>versus a tiger like those that I do that</v>
<v Speaker 5>crossfit stuff and all the guys I do </v>

3542
02:24:07.221 --> 02:24:10.300
<v Speaker 5>crossfit with our obsessive compulsive </v>
<v Speaker 5>and very intellectual,</v>

3543
02:24:10.301 --> 02:24:15.301
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you find these guys are great athletes </v>

3544
02:24:15.301 --> 02:24:15.301
<v Speaker 5>and you would think they're just dumb </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking,</v>

3545
02:24:15.301 --> 02:24:16.140
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>can climb a rope and fucking power lift,</v>

3546
02:24:16.141 --> 02:24:17.850
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>deadlift 500 pounds,</v>

3547
02:24:18.210 --> 02:24:23.210
<v Speaker 5>but you start finding out they know </v>
<v Speaker 5>everything about nutrition and then </v>

3548
02:24:23.210 --> 02:24:24.350
<v Speaker 5>everything about this and then it goes </v>
<v Speaker 5>to supplant transcendent.</v>

3549
02:24:24.390 --> 02:24:26.040
<v Speaker 5>People are not disciplined,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

3550
02:24:26.190 --> 02:24:29.420
<v Speaker 5>Dumb people can work hard if they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>like in a football camp and the coach is</v>

3551
02:24:29.430 --> 02:24:31.800
<v Speaker 5>screaming at you every day or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you have to,</v>

3552
02:24:32.000 --> 02:24:37.000
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what you're in the army or something </v>

3553
02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:37.000
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>

3554
02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:38.810
<v Speaker 5>But when you have to motivate yourself </v>
<v Speaker 5>to go to the gym and you have to </v>

3555
02:24:38.810 --> 02:24:39.960
<v Speaker 5>motivate yourself to buy the proper </v>
<v Speaker 5>nutrition and that takes intelligence,</v>

3556
02:24:39.961 --> 02:24:41.550
<v Speaker 5>it takes a certain amount of discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3557
02:24:41.551 --> 02:24:43.610
<v Speaker 5>So I've seen that these mixed martial </v>
<v Speaker 5>arts I've said,</v>

3558
02:24:43.650 --> 02:24:46.100
<v Speaker 5>because I would say that them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the guys that,</v>

3559
02:24:46.140 --> 02:24:51.140
<v Speaker 5>that do fight and are really into it are</v>
<v Speaker 5>probably good fans that really get all </v>

3560
02:24:51.140 --> 02:24:53.580
<v Speaker 5>your material and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and get into like the intellectual shit.</v>

3561
02:24:53.581 --> 02:24:56.820
<v Speaker 5>But I'm thinking like the average guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wwf foam and goes,</v>

3562
02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.720
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just want to see some broken blood.</v>

3563
02:25:00.430 --> 02:25:02.340
<v Speaker 5>This.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Does he come to your show and be like,</v>

3564
02:25:02.341 --> 02:25:03.390
<v Speaker 5>don't be a dick joke.</v>

3565
02:25:03.520 --> 02:25:05.250
<v Speaker 12>There's that.</v>
<v Speaker 12>But you know what man,</v>

3566
02:25:05.251 --> 02:25:08.250
<v Speaker 12>I,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I make sure I try very hard to make sure</v>

3567
02:25:08.251 --> 02:25:10.350
<v Speaker 12>that my jokes are first and foremost </v>
<v Speaker 12>funny.</v>

3568
02:25:10.580 --> 02:25:15.580
<v Speaker 12>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>whatever my point of view is on </v>

3569
02:25:15.580 --> 02:25:15.580
<v Speaker 12>something.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It has to be,</v>

3570
02:25:15.580 --> 02:25:16.650
<v Speaker 12>it has to be digestible to a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 12>people.</v>

3571
02:25:16.800 --> 02:25:18.450
<v Speaker 12>But there's some weird shit that I might</v>
<v Speaker 12>think.</v>

3572
02:25:18.451 --> 02:25:19.900
<v Speaker 12>It's funny that if I had an audience </v>
<v Speaker 12>audience filled</v>

3573
02:25:19.900 --> 02:25:20.240
<v Speaker 5>with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3574
02:25:20.590 --> 02:25:23.950
<v Speaker 5>only like guys like you or dunk in or </v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3575
02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:25.930
<v Speaker 12>someone who's like a very smart person </v>
<v Speaker 12>that's,</v>

3576
02:25:25.931 --> 02:25:27.040
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>of a certain age.</v>

3577
02:25:27.041 --> 02:25:30.150
<v Speaker 12>I could talk to about almost anything I </v>
<v Speaker 12>would do different materials.</v>

3578
02:25:30.420 --> 02:25:31.750
<v Speaker 12>It was just you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

3579
02:25:31.930 --> 02:25:34.270
<v Speaker 12>but to an audience full of a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 12>people.</v>

3580
02:25:34.271 --> 02:25:35.710
<v Speaker 12>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I want everybody to have fun.</v>

3581
02:25:35.980 --> 02:25:36.640
<v Speaker 12>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 12>and the party filled with ideas and </v>

3586
02:25:48.990 --> 02:25:50.560
<v Speaker 12>thoughts and then you know that I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 12>coming from coming from a place of ego.</v>

3587
02:25:50.561 --> 02:25:51.890
<v Speaker 12>I'm not a egomania I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'm,</v>

3588
02:25:52.020 --> 02:25:54.040
<v Speaker 12>I'm calling for a place to just,</v>
<v Speaker 12>let's just figure this out.</v>

3589
02:25:54.041 --> 02:25:55.750
<v Speaker 12>Let's try to put this all together.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's not me,</v>

3590
02:25:55.751 --> 02:25:57.970
<v Speaker 12>it's not about me.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's about these ideas.</v>

3591
02:25:57.971 --> 02:26:00.910
<v Speaker 12>It's about fun.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's about having a good goddamn time up</v>

3592
02:26:00.911 --> 02:26:01.180
<v Speaker 12>there.</v>

3593
02:26:01.700 --> 02:26:04.240
<v Speaker 12>So it's the ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 12>But I've got a lot of weird shit.</v>

3594
02:26:04.241 --> 02:26:07.530
<v Speaker 12>My act about time travel and the large </v>
<v Speaker 12>hadron collider and there's like,</v>

3595
02:26:07.750 --> 02:26:09.570
<v Speaker 12>there's some shit that,</v>
<v Speaker 12>there's some songs.</v>

3596
02:26:09.610 --> 02:26:11.350
<v Speaker 12>Sometimes when I'm on stage I go,</v>
<v Speaker 12>god damn,</v>

3597
02:26:11.351 --> 02:26:13.960
<v Speaker 12>I'm taking these motherfuckers don't </v>
<v Speaker 12>fucking twisty road here.</v>

3598
02:26:13.961 --> 02:26:18.961
<v Speaker 12>I hope there with me no hope there with </v>
<v Speaker 12>me when the punchlines come because </v>

3599
02:26:18.961 --> 02:26:18.961
<v Speaker 12>there might've been like,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

3600
02:26:18.961 --> 02:26:21.290
<v Speaker 12>after five minutes of large hadron </v>
<v Speaker 12>collider rant when I get to the end,</v>

3601
02:26:21.291 --> 02:26:23.140
<v Speaker 12>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 12>what the fuck is he talking about?</v>

3602
02:26:23.480 --> 02:26:24.850
<v Speaker 12>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>people are taking notes.</v>

3603
02:26:24.851 --> 02:26:26.740
<v Speaker 12>I better go home and read about this </v>
<v Speaker 12>shit.</v>

3604
02:26:26.830 --> 02:26:27.450
<v Speaker 12>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

3605
02:26:27.460 --> 02:26:31.360
<v Speaker 12>I initially I sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

3606
02:26:31.361 --> 02:26:36.361
<v Speaker 12>did comedy just to try to get labs and </v>
<v Speaker 12>this is what I always say that there's </v>

3607
02:26:36.361 --> 02:26:36.361
<v Speaker 12>like a bunch of different stages of </v>
<v Speaker 12>comedy.</v>

3608
02:26:36.361 --> 02:26:38.920
<v Speaker 12>I think the first age that you do </v>
<v Speaker 12>anything you can to get a laugh,</v>

3609
02:26:39.100 --> 02:26:39.550
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I mean,</v>

3610
02:26:39.580 --> 02:26:44.580
<v Speaker 12>I'm sure you've said that some hacky </v>
<v Speaker 12>lines in your life that you're not lost </v>

3611
02:26:44.580 --> 02:26:44.580
<v Speaker 12>about.</v>

3612
02:26:44.580 --> 02:26:48.130
<v Speaker 12>I mean I look back the last time,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I think in 1997 or 90.</v>

3613
02:26:48.250 --> 02:26:50.120
<v Speaker 12>No earlier than that.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I was on newsradio though.</v>

3614
02:26:50.121 --> 02:26:51.190
<v Speaker 12>It was like 95,</v>
<v Speaker 12>96.</v>

3615
02:26:51.400 --> 02:26:52.630
<v Speaker 12>I told some woman,</v>
<v Speaker 12>hey,</v>

3616
02:26:52.631 --> 02:26:54.520
<v Speaker 12>I don't come to your job and slap the </v>
<v Speaker 12>dicks out of your mouth.</v>

3617
02:26:54.700 --> 02:26:58.660
<v Speaker 12>I can't believe I still use that.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Like in 90 I used it one time.</v>

3618
02:26:58.690 --> 02:27:01.750
<v Speaker 12>It was in montreal at the comedy works.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Some chick said something right after.</v>

3619
02:27:01.751 --> 02:27:02.230
<v Speaker 12>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'm like,</v>

3620
02:27:02.231 --> 02:27:03.220
<v Speaker 12>man,</v>
<v Speaker 12>really?</v>

3621
02:27:03.400 --> 02:27:07.450
<v Speaker 12>You didn't even dig into your bag.</v>
<v Speaker 12>You just grabbed the most obvious stupid</v>

3622
02:27:07.451 --> 02:27:09.550
<v Speaker 12>hacky law.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I still think about that to this day.</v>

3623
02:27:09.880 --> 02:27:14.880
<v Speaker 12>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 12>I think initially you're just trying to </v>

3624
02:27:14.880 --> 02:27:17.551
<v Speaker 12>get laughs and then once you get good </v>
<v Speaker 12>then it goes from what makes me laugh,</v>

3625
02:27:17.800 --> 02:27:22.800
<v Speaker 12>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 12>Instead of just trying to make anybody </v>

3626
02:27:22.800 --> 02:27:22.800
<v Speaker 12>laugh with like a tool,</v>
<v Speaker 12>like I have a hammer,</v>

3627
02:27:22.800 --> 02:27:23.230
<v Speaker 12>look at my hammer,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'm going to hit the nail dong.</v>

3628
02:27:23.410 --> 02:27:26.290
<v Speaker 12>Then it becomes your perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's like becomes,</v>

3629
02:27:26.560 --> 02:27:27.570
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>this is that,</v>

3630
02:27:27.580 --> 02:27:32.580
<v Speaker 12>this actually is funny to me,</v>
<v Speaker 12>and then it becomes how do you make </v>

3631
02:27:32.580 --> 02:27:32.860
<v Speaker 12>someone laugh with your opinions on </v>
<v Speaker 12>things like what,</v>

3632
02:27:32.870 --> 02:27:37.870
<v Speaker 12>what are your unique points of view that</v>
<v Speaker 12>you can somehow or another turn into </v>

3633
02:27:37.870 --> 02:27:41.761
<v Speaker 12>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So to me there's like been three stages </v>

3634
02:27:41.761 --> 02:27:41.890
<v Speaker 12>in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 12>The first stage was just say anything.</v>

3635
02:27:42.010 --> 02:27:44.980
<v Speaker 12>Even if you didn't believe in it.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I said a lot of stupid shit about,</v>

3636
02:27:45.220 --> 02:27:47.560
<v Speaker 12>about gay people,</v>
<v Speaker 12>about whatever the fuck I was,</v>

3637
02:27:47.620 --> 02:27:49.180
<v Speaker 12>if I thought it would work,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

3638
02:27:49.181 --> 02:27:50.740
<v Speaker 12>to me it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 12>is this a brick?</v>

3639
02:27:50.770 --> 02:27:52.990
<v Speaker 12>Can I kill a rat with it?</v>
<v Speaker 12>Let's kill her at,</v>

3640
02:27:53.020 --> 02:27:54.600
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it was just a tool.</v>

3641
02:27:54.670 --> 02:27:56.770
<v Speaker 12>I think I followed your model and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 12>just,</v>

3642
02:27:56.850 --> 02:28:01.850
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>years behind you doing the same thing </v>

3643
02:28:01.850 --> 02:28:01.850
<v Speaker 12>where it's the analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 12>good analogy.</v>

3644
02:28:01.850 --> 02:28:03.190
<v Speaker 12>Hired was golf.</v>
<v Speaker 12>They said when you learn to golf,</v>

3645
02:28:03.550 --> 02:28:08.550
<v Speaker 12>just fucking hit the ball as far as you </v>
<v Speaker 12>can fucking hit it and then hone your </v>

3646
02:28:08.550 --> 02:28:11.500
<v Speaker 12>swing and bring it in instead of trying </v>
<v Speaker 12>to hit it right.</v>

3647
02:28:11.530 --> 02:28:14.950
<v Speaker 12>And then trying to hit it far so like </v>
<v Speaker 12>try to kill it first.</v>

3648
02:28:15.540 --> 02:28:20.540
<v Speaker 12>Try to learn how to kill and once you </v>
<v Speaker 12>kill you'll get all that confidence and </v>

3649
02:28:20.540 --> 02:28:22.220
<v Speaker 12>you'll never be scared and then hone it </v>
<v Speaker 12>in the good,</v>

3650
02:28:22.370 --> 02:28:23.780
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>view.</v>

<v Speaker 4>with that.</v>

3653
02:28:28.280 --> 02:28:30.010
<v Speaker 4>Some guys probably have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they try,</v>

3654
02:28:30.011 --> 02:28:35.011
<v Speaker 4>but they seem so pretentious and </v>
<v Speaker 4>especially when you're 20 and you're </v>
