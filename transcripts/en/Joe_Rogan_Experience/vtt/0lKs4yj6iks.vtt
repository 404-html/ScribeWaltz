00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.710
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:02.371
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3
00:00:02.371 --> 00:00:04.380
<v Speaker 1>I screen capture all that time all day.</v>

4
00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:06.630
<v Speaker 1>There really should be sexual service industry.</v>

5
00:00:06.631 --> 00:00:07.560
<v Speaker 1>There really should be,</v>

6
00:00:07.561 --> 00:00:07.801
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:09.180
<v Speaker 1>the idea that that's illegal.</v>

8
00:00:09.181 --> 00:00:10.530
<v Speaker 1>It's so fucking gross.</v>

9
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:11.040
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

10
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.040
<v Speaker 1>I think it probably causes more rape causes more anger if prostitution.</v>

11
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:17.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't want my daughter to be a prostitute of course.</v>

13
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.270
<v Speaker 1>But if prostitution was legal,</v>

14
00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.310
<v Speaker 1>so people are going to do it and guess what?</v>

15
00:00:23.311 --> 00:00:26.250
<v Speaker 1>Some people are going to actually like to do it and some people get to enjoy</v>

16
00:00:26.251 --> 00:00:28.080
<v Speaker 1>going there and some people,</v>

17
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.110
<v Speaker 1>they're just crazy bitches and they really wouldn't do anything else anyway.</v>

18
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.530
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

19
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.011
<v Speaker 1>And what are you gonna do?</v>

20
00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:33.060
<v Speaker 1>Are Going gonna fix the whole world.</v>

21
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.910
<v Speaker 1>You're going to fix the whole world or are you gonna let them get tested and get</v>

22
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.450
<v Speaker 1>taxed and let them be treated like they're not some outlaw,</v>

23
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:39.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

24
00:00:39.841 --> 00:00:40.501
<v Speaker 1>it's not an,</v>

25
00:00:40.501 --> 00:00:40.730
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

26
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.030
<v Speaker 1>it's an outlaw thing.</v>

27
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.740
<v Speaker 1>If you're a prostitute,</v>

28
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.790
<v Speaker 1>Europe criminal,</v>

29
00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.950
<v Speaker 1>if you're giving away sex for free,</v>

30
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:47.910
<v Speaker 1>you're just a whore.</v>

31
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.680
<v Speaker 1>But if you're actually getting money for it,</v>

32
00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:50.790
<v Speaker 1>you go to jail,</v>

33
00:00:50.791 --> 00:00:52.230
<v Speaker 1>they lock you in a cage.</v>

34
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.150
<v Speaker 1>And the idea that we still have that in 2011 regardless of what your beliefs are</v>

35
00:00:57.151 --> 00:00:57.631
<v Speaker 1>about sex,</v>

36
00:00:57.631 --> 00:00:59.310
<v Speaker 1>whether you should or shouldn't go to a prostitute.</v>

37
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.140
<v Speaker 1>I agree that it's kind of a weird thing.</v>

38
00:01:01.141 --> 00:01:02.460
<v Speaker 1>It's a little dehumanizing.</v>

39
00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:03.330
<v Speaker 1>The whole conditions.</v>

40
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.081
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange,</v>

41
00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:06.090
<v Speaker 1>but fucking for sure it should be legal.</v>

42
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.670
<v Speaker 1>You just can't lock people in a jail.</v>

43
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.240
<v Speaker 1>You lock people in a cage for making someone feel good with their mouth.</v>

44
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:14.130
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is wrong with you?</v>

45
00:01:14.131 --> 00:01:14.940
<v Speaker 1>It's insanity.</v>

46
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.030
<v Speaker 1>It's absolute fucking in Santa.</v>

47
00:01:17.031 --> 00:01:20.910
<v Speaker 1>Can Lunacy man complete in Santa Ana and the fact that it's not challenged,</v>

48
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.120
<v Speaker 1>the fact that that's not challenged in 2011 like,</v>

49
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.950
<v Speaker 2>and the fact that Apple's not censoring it off as Siri,</v>

50
00:01:27.951 --> 00:01:30.350
<v Speaker 2>when you're asking for a blow job and they tell you what they look,</v>

51
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.240
<v Speaker 2>the closest escort agency is.</v>

52
00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:33.920
<v Speaker 2>Did you know that this is what he did?</v>

53
00:01:33.921 --> 00:01:34.880
<v Speaker 2>He asked it.</v>

54
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.460
<v Speaker 2>He was asking,</v>

55
00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

56
00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.030
<v Speaker 2>I haven't told you this last night.</v>

57
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.890
<v Speaker 2>I just sit there in bed and try new things,</v>

58
00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:40.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

59
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.971
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sitting there,</v>

60
00:01:40.971 --> 00:01:41.330
<v Speaker 2>he'll go,</v>

61
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.700
<v Speaker 2>I need,</v>

62
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:42.620
<v Speaker 2>I want a blow job.</v>

63
00:01:42.621 --> 00:01:42.981
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

64
00:01:42.981 --> 00:01:47.150
<v Speaker 2>we found Ford escort agencies closest to you and it was like 27 miles away.</v>

65
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:47.481
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

66
00:01:47.481 --> 00:01:49.960
<v Speaker 2>Steve Jobs is program some shit in there.</v>

67
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.500
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

68
00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.730
<v Speaker 2>Just waiting for someone to say the right thing.</v>

69
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.170
<v Speaker 2>I just hope they don't start censoring it though.</v>

70
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.850
<v Speaker 2>Apples keep on going that way.</v>

71
00:01:55.851 --> 00:01:56.930
<v Speaker 2>Make it like the Internet.</v>

72
00:01:56.931 --> 00:01:57.860
<v Speaker 2>Don't start censoring it.</v>

73
00:01:57.861 --> 00:02:01.610
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking cool that you actually have that in their portal.</v>

74
00:02:01.611 --> 00:02:02.444
<v Speaker 2>Siri.</v>

75
00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.670
<v Speaker 2>He just put it in there knowing eventually.</v>

76
00:02:05.671 --> 00:02:05.990
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

77
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.350
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

78
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.090
<v Speaker 1>What is exactly going to happen on December 21st,</v>

79
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.240
<v Speaker 1>2012</v>

80
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.640
<v Speaker 2>cannot access future node.</v>

81
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.303
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>

82
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.581
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

83
00:02:15.581 --> 00:02:16.700
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking cool man.</v>

84
00:02:16.701 --> 00:02:18.220
<v Speaker 2>But one thing that seems interesting,</v>

85
00:02:18.221 --> 00:02:21.880
<v Speaker 2>it seems like that it's a run off a server because it's been,</v>

86
00:02:21.881 --> 00:02:22.091
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

87
00:02:22.091 --> 00:02:24.400
<v Speaker 2>everyone's activating the Siri,</v>

88
00:02:24.401 --> 00:02:27.640
<v Speaker 2>which is a remote assistant on the new iPhone four s is what we're talking</v>

89
00:02:27.641 --> 00:02:27.840
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

90
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.040
<v Speaker 1>Well you know what it's based on,</v>

91
00:02:29.041 --> 00:02:29.874
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

92
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.713
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

93
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.550
<v Speaker 1>the dragon or no,</v>

94
00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.080
<v Speaker 1>based on Wolfram Alpha,</v>

95
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.490
<v Speaker 1>which was that search engine,</v>

96
00:02:35.491 --> 00:02:38.670
<v Speaker 1>it was created by all these PhDs they wanted,</v>

97
00:02:38.671 --> 00:02:42.600
<v Speaker 1>they literally wanted to put together the concept is a website that can answer</v>

98
00:02:42.601 --> 00:02:43.434
<v Speaker 1>any question.</v>

99
00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.030
<v Speaker 1>So no matter what your question is,</v>

100
00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:45.690
<v Speaker 1>you know where I'm going.</v>

101
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.150
<v Speaker 1>What is the weight of one pound of nuclear waste it before I've used it for</v>

102
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.840
<v Speaker 1>shipping.</v>

103
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

104
00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.140
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

105
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.351
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

106
00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:53.520
<v Speaker 1>so apparently that's what,</v>

107
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:54.360
<v Speaker 1>that's what,</v>

108
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.320
<v Speaker 1>what's behind all that?</v>

109
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:56.770
<v Speaker 2>That's really cool.</v>

110
00:02:56.771 --> 00:02:57.460
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

111
00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.640
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

112
00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:58.930
<v Speaker 2>When you ask for a dead body,</v>

113
00:02:58.931 --> 00:02:59.800
<v Speaker 2>it a sewer,</v>

114
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:00.820
<v Speaker 2>an old warehouse.</v>

115
00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:01.700
<v Speaker 2>A junkyard,</v>

116
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.490
<v Speaker 2>where to put a dead body.</v>

117
00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:03.791
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

118
00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 2>You didn't make that.</v>

119
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:05.890
<v Speaker 2>I thought this is a fake.</v>

120
00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:06.101
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

121
00:03:06.101 --> 00:03:06.250
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

122
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.401
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

123
00:03:06.401 --> 00:03:06.541
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

124
00:03:06.541 --> 00:03:06.940
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

125
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:07.480
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

126
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.180
<v Speaker 2>I've been laying in bed and using it just like fucking making up shit.</v>

127
00:03:11.181 --> 00:03:13.570
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit device.</v>

128
00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:15.940
<v Speaker 2>If you ever have a gadget and want to learn everything about it.</v>

129
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.900
<v Speaker 2>I just bought Brian One too,</v>

130
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:19.190
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

131
00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:20.440
<v Speaker 2>Then I say,</v>

132
00:03:20.441 --> 00:03:21.490
<v Speaker 2>where are we at now?</v>

133
00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:21.941
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

134
00:03:21.941 --> 00:03:22.271
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

135
00:03:22.271 --> 00:03:25.000
<v Speaker 2>this is what I just found out and he'll find shit on it that you would never</v>

136
00:03:25.001 --> 00:03:25.781
<v Speaker 2>figure it out yourself.</v>

137
00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:26.680
<v Speaker 2>Fucking know.</v>

138
00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:26.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

139
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.420
<v Speaker 2>Well he's just a gadget whore.</v>

140
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.730
<v Speaker 2>I need to figure it out.</v>

141
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.270
<v Speaker 2>Take you with them and I think it's run off a server like I think like that</v>

142
00:03:34.271 --> 00:03:37.720
<v Speaker 2>they're going to be able to constantly upgrade it as time goes on.</v>

143
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.390
<v Speaker 2>And I'm just worried now that with all the attention to all the,</v>

144
00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:43.150
<v Speaker 2>of course the x rated stuff that they're going to start censoring.</v>

145
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.730
<v Speaker 2>It went and I hope they don't start doing that and,</v>

146
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.001
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

147
00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:48.940
<v Speaker 2>but it is cool to think like what Siri in five years is going to be,</v>

148
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.270
<v Speaker 2>just like when we first saw the iPhone one to see how it's changed the</v>

149
00:03:52.271 --> 00:03:54.830
<v Speaker 2>technology from then it's going to be pretty much a PR,</v>

150
00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.740
<v Speaker 2>like most relationships without sex,</v>

151
00:03:56.741 --> 00:03:57.700
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be better than that.</v>

152
00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:58.031
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

153
00:03:58.031 --> 00:03:58.241
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

154
00:03:58.241 --> 00:03:58.541
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

155
00:03:58.541 --> 00:04:00.760
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be anything you want to talk about,</v>

156
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.770
<v Speaker 2>any questions you have to ask and you're going,</v>

157
00:04:02.771 --> 00:04:03.640
<v Speaker 2>it's going to learn,</v>

158
00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.020
<v Speaker 2>it's going to get to know you.</v>

159
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.291
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

160
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:05.561
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

161
00:04:05.561 --> 00:04:08.530
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty much going to be like artificial intelligence.</v>

162
00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:10.630
<v Speaker 2>I think that is those relationships,</v>

163
00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.640
<v Speaker 2>that sex because what else is that?</v>

164
00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.560
<v Speaker 2>You're sitting there talking to a computer.</v>

165
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.873
<v Speaker 2>Most of them.</v>

166
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:16.590
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

167
00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.940
<v Speaker 2>like most like a relationship without sex.</v>

168
00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:19.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

169
00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.751
<v Speaker 2>know what,</v>

170
00:04:19.751 --> 00:04:21.070
<v Speaker 2>you won't feel the same.</v>

171
00:04:21.071 --> 00:04:21.904
<v Speaker 2>That's what the,</v>

172
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.570
<v Speaker 2>if you know that the robot is there for you because it's artificial,</v>

173
00:04:25.571 --> 00:04:26.500
<v Speaker 2>you're going to abuse it.</v>

174
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.810
<v Speaker 2>It's not like a person that you love to have around.</v>

175
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.230
<v Speaker 2>I think most people would probably just beat the fuck out of the robots.</v>

176
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.130
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

177
00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:38.130
<v Speaker 2>I knew that the robot wasn't a person but was always going to like look out for</v>

178
00:04:38.141 --> 00:04:41.590
<v Speaker 2>them and be there for them and then you would find that role but ignoring and</v>

179
00:04:41.591 --> 00:04:44.250
<v Speaker 2>you would kick his ass cause you know he couldn't fight back cause it's a bit of</v>

180
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.340
<v Speaker 2>a protective right.</v>

181
00:04:45.341 --> 00:04:47.230
<v Speaker 2>But if it gets to know you better and me,</v>

182
00:04:47.231 --> 00:04:47.991
<v Speaker 2>I'm already late.</v>

183
00:04:47.991 --> 00:04:48.431
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

184
00:04:48.431 --> 00:04:49.160
<v Speaker 2>it's a robot.</v>

185
00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.960
<v Speaker 2>But if it gets to know what your answers would be in your personality better</v>

186
00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.910
<v Speaker 2>cause I'm already interested in it and it's just not even smart right now.</v>

187
00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:00.790
<v Speaker 2>But what if it starts to get to know you and now you're so interested in it,</v>

188
00:05:00.791 --> 00:05:04.240
<v Speaker 2>like crack you want to asking what if you fall in love with your phone?</v>

189
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

190
00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:05.360
<v Speaker 2>she's,</v>

191
00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:06.193
<v Speaker 2>she has things,</v>

192
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.100
<v Speaker 2>I even asked it to sing the other day and it starts singing me a song.</v>

193
00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.491
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

194
00:05:09.491 --> 00:05:10.540
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty much,</v>

195
00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.970
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

196
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.160
<v Speaker 2>it has,</v>

197
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.360
<v Speaker 2>it's fascinating.</v>

198
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.140
<v Speaker 2>Like I wanted to,</v>

199
00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:15.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm addicted to it.</v>

200
00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.933
<v Speaker 2>I'm addicted to,</v>

201
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.250
<v Speaker 2>Brian just got a cursed iPhone.</v>

202
00:05:18.251 --> 00:05:19.150
<v Speaker 2>It's not Siri.</v>

203
00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:20.320
<v Speaker 2>It's got a demon in it.</v>

204
00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.810
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
