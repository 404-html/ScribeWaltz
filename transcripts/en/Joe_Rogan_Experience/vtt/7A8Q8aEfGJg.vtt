00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:03.900
<v Speaker 1>Four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

2
00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.790
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

3
00:00:05.791 --> 00:00:07.230
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mick West.</v>

4
00:00:07.231 --> 00:00:09.690
<v Speaker 1>We are alive finally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you ready?</v>

5
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:10.950
<v Speaker 1>I am ready.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do it.</v>

6
00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.020
<v Speaker 1>Until you're getting a lot of heat </v>
<v Speaker 1>online from all these.</v>

7
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.440
<v Speaker 1>It's all the flat earth people and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chem trail people.</v>

8
00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:18.120
<v Speaker 1>Those are the people that are mad at you</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most.</v>

9
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.870
<v Speaker 1>That's my specialty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chem trails and flutter.</v>

10
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's.</v>

11
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.070
<v Speaker 1>I ask people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is hilarious.</v>

12
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:28.170
<v Speaker 1>I asked people online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

13
00:00:28.171 --> 00:00:30.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm mick west from Medibank is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be here.</v>

14
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.230
<v Speaker 1>What would you like me to debunk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the first ones was chem </v>

15
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.740
<v Speaker 1>trails because you cannot debunk it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real Dun Dun,</v>

16
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.250
<v Speaker 1>Duh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would do.</v>

17
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.370
<v Speaker 1>I would say this to anybody who thinks </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that has got to be the most </v>

18
00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:49.740
<v Speaker 1>ineffective government program of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

19
00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Like he asked people what they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 1>things in the sky and the number one </v>

20
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.540
<v Speaker 1>thing they'll say is like weather </v>
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>

21
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.070
<v Speaker 1>Weather controls one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they don't have any fucking control</v>

22
00:01:00.071 --> 00:01:05.071
<v Speaker 1>of the weather because if they did </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd make it rain all over Santa </v>

23
00:01:05.071 --> 00:01:05.071
<v Speaker 1>Barbara and stop these fires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

24
00:01:05.071 --> 00:01:09.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's hundreds of millions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars where the damage going on right </v>

25
00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:13.131
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a fire that's bigger than the </v>

26
00:01:13.131 --> 00:01:13.131
<v Speaker 1>city of Washington DC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think they're making those bias.</v>

27
00:01:13.131 --> 00:01:15.090
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy.</v>

28
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.680
<v Speaker 1>Anything that happens is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

29
00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:19.740
<v Speaker 1>as part of the conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think it is?</v>

30
00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:23.460
<v Speaker 1>Like what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is it with conspiracies,</v>

31
00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.640
<v Speaker 1>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are they so attractive to people?</v>

32
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.590
<v Speaker 1>There's something going on with people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

33
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

34
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:35.220
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been looking into this a lot and </v>

35
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.390
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially since you're a government </v>

36
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.390
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

37
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing research with a book on </v>
<v Speaker 2>writing called escaping the rabbit hole </v>

38
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.441
<v Speaker 2>and it's about how people get into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rabbit hole and how people get out of </v>

39
00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:48.711
<v Speaker 2>the rabbit hole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the whole thing is about the rabbit </v>

40
00:01:48.711 --> 00:01:51.141
<v Speaker 2>hole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is something basically people get </v>

41
00:01:51.141 --> 00:01:53.721
<v Speaker 2>sucked into and I think people do a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of research into the reasons behind </v>

42
00:01:53.721 --> 00:01:58.491
<v Speaker 2>people getting into conspiracy theories </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the psychological reasons and they </v>

43
00:01:58.491 --> 00:01:58.491
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

44
00:01:58.491 --> 00:02:00.150
<v Speaker 2>personality reasons and things like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

45
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.900
<v Speaker 2>But I think most conspiracy theorists </v>
<v Speaker 2>are just regular people.</v>

46
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.810
<v Speaker 2>They're just ordinary people who get </v>
<v Speaker 2>sucked into something.</v>

47
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.260
<v Speaker 2>And why do you think that is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just from talking to them,</v>

48
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.450
<v Speaker 2>they tell me like the origin stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the origin stories essentially,</v>

49
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.750
<v Speaker 2>and they tell me what happened to them </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they got into conspiracy theories </v>

50
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:22.200
<v Speaker 2>and it nearly always starts with looking</v>
<v Speaker 2>at some video.</v>

51
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.180
<v Speaker 2>I now nowadays with them looking at some</v>
<v Speaker 2>video and then they just get sucked in.</v>

52
00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they start looking at another </v>

53
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.071
<v Speaker 2>video and another video and another </v>
<v Speaker 2>video and facebook and youtube is </v>

54
00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:36.990
<v Speaker 2>feeding them these videos because once </v>
<v Speaker 2>you start going down that road,</v>

55
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.610
<v Speaker 2>you just can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't change your trajectory.</v>

56
00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.030
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to treat in Youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

57
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.570
<v Speaker 1>since they instigated this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

58
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.120
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>autoplay thing or instituted this </v>

59
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.910
<v Speaker 1>autoplay thing or the next video plays </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately and they're all related.</v>

60
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.430
<v Speaker 1>I think that's definitely been a thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with people.</v>

61
00:02:57.431 --> 00:03:02.431
<v Speaker 1>And also like the suggestions on right </v>
<v Speaker 1>hand side if you're watching one video </v>

62
00:03:02.431 --> 00:03:02.431
<v Speaker 1>in particular subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

63
00:03:02.431 --> 00:03:05.770
<v Speaker 1>Within some experiments with that set up</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a completely blank youtube account.</v>

64
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:10.830
<v Speaker 1>And I would just go in there and typing </v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing like con trials and of course </v>

65
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:13.570
<v Speaker 1>when you look at trails on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like half the videos,</v>

66
00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:15.400
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get it going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kentrell videos.</v>

67
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.270
<v Speaker 1>And so if the first video you click on </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the chem trail video,</v>

68
00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.760
<v Speaker 1>then that just sets you down that road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

69
00:03:21.761 --> 00:03:26.761
<v Speaker 1>I remember this was in the days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think before youtube,</v>

70
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.550
<v Speaker 1>this is in the days when maybe youtube </v>
<v Speaker 1>was around,</v>

71
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:31.840
<v Speaker 1>but it just wasn't that popular.</v>

72
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:37.110
<v Speaker 1>I remember me and my friend Eddie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're high as fuck and we're talking to </v>

73
00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.491
<v Speaker 1>my neighbor and there was some plane </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was flying over and we were </v>

74
00:03:41.491 --> 00:03:43.810
<v Speaker 1>wondering why the clouds coming from </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind this plane's stood so long.</v>

75
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.780
<v Speaker 1>And so I asked him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

76
00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.050
<v Speaker 1>this neighbor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to call them bling,</v>

77
00:03:47.051 --> 00:03:48.850
<v Speaker 1>bling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bling,</v>

78
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:53.080
<v Speaker 1>bling was incapable of talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything other than objects.</v>

79
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.950
<v Speaker 1>Like all we talk about that as a nice </v>
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

80
00:03:54.951 --> 00:03:56.080
<v Speaker 1>It's got a new car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you get there?</v>

81
00:03:56.081 --> 00:03:57.250
<v Speaker 1>Watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was blank,</v>

82
00:03:57.251 --> 00:04:02.251
<v Speaker 1>blank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All bling bling wanted to talk about is </v>

83
00:04:02.251 --> 00:04:02.251
<v Speaker 1>like material possessions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

84
00:04:02.251 --> 00:04:04.430
<v Speaker 1>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knows were parked uh,</v>

85
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.430
<v Speaker 1>in front of his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was saying hi to them and I said,</v>

86
00:04:06.431 --> 00:04:07.660
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you remember clouds?</v>

87
00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.880
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stick it around and this guy that long.</v>

88
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.190
<v Speaker 1>And he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

89
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.920
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

90
00:04:11.921 --> 00:04:12.640
<v Speaker 1>Is that a new truck?</v>

91
00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.700
<v Speaker 1>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just remember how ironic it was </v>

92
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:18.970
<v Speaker 1>because I had told Eddie about blink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blink,</v>

93
00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:24.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is all this guy cares about and </v>

94
00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.281
<v Speaker 1>wants to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he did that while we're out </v>

95
00:04:26.281 --> 00:04:26.281
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I remember thinking,</v>

96
00:04:26.281 --> 00:04:28.840
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how weird would it be if all of a sudden</v>

97
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.900
<v Speaker 1>clouds from jet engines started </v>
<v Speaker 1>appearing and it just appeared right </v>

98
00:04:34.031 --> 00:04:38.560
<v Speaker 1>before our eyes and we had noticed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I wasn't sold.</v>

99
00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:43.650
<v Speaker 1>It didn't make any sense to me because </v>
<v Speaker 1>my thought on it was the amount of </v>

100
00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:44.770
<v Speaker 1>people that had to be involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about all these different</v>

101
00:04:44.771 --> 00:04:46.750
<v Speaker 1>airplanes get all these people to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>their mouth shut.</v>

102
00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.030
<v Speaker 1>These are their pilots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

103
00:04:49.031 --> 00:04:52.180
<v Speaker 1>So they're not making shit tons of money</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they live here too.</v>

104
00:04:52.181 --> 00:04:57.181
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if there's actually spraying </v>

105
00:04:57.181 --> 00:04:57.181
<v Speaker 1>something in the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they live here too.</v>

106
00:04:57.181 --> 00:04:59.760
<v Speaker 1>Like what are they spraying themselves?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the theory now is the,</v>

107
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:04.770
<v Speaker 1>it's basically the power elite in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country is doing these chem trails as it</v>

108
00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.960
<v Speaker 1>kinda latched last ditch attempt to </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintain power before the entire world </v>

109
00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:14.521
<v Speaker 1>collapses into chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they think it's kind of like a </v>

110
00:05:14.521 --> 00:05:14.950
<v Speaker 1>desperate situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A power grab.</v>

111
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.370
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

112
00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.180
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hanging on to have that kind of last</v>

113
00:05:19.181 --> 00:05:20.510
<v Speaker 1>hurrah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

114
00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.390
<v Speaker 1>they feel like the end of the world is </v>
<v Speaker 1>nigh,</v>

115
00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:27.400
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know this about to put this </v>

116
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:27.400
<v Speaker 1>environmental disaster and the chem </v>
<v Speaker 1>trails.</v>

117
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:28.930
<v Speaker 1>So the only thing that is holding </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything together,</v>

118
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.230
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing that you get if you go </v>
<v Speaker 1>to like,</v>

119
00:05:31.231 --> 00:05:32.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gun geoengineering,</v>

120
00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:35.170
<v Speaker 1>watch Dane Wigington Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

121
00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.530
<v Speaker 1>he's basically a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an apocalyptic prophet now.</v>

122
00:05:38.531 --> 00:05:42.220
<v Speaker 1>He's basically preaching about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is going to end soon.</v>

123
00:05:42.221 --> 00:05:45.730
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chem trails of the only thing that's</v>

124
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.220
<v Speaker 1>stopping it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also making it worse.</v>

125
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.840
<v Speaker 1>So he's kind of saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

126
00:05:49.841 --> 00:05:52.090
<v Speaker 1>the controls are helping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we got to stop them.</v>

127
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll make it even worse,</v>

128
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:59.400
<v Speaker 1>but we're pretty much all going to die </v>
<v Speaker 1>either way because a lot of money and </v>

129
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.310
<v Speaker 1>we're going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that love that,</v>

130
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.400
<v Speaker 1>that that trope is just like something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that gets carted out constantly </v>

131
00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.750
<v Speaker 1>throughout history because it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are going to die.</v>

132
00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:10.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when are you going to die?</v>

133
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.900
<v Speaker 1>You don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because you don't know.</v>

134
00:06:11.901 --> 00:06:12.890
<v Speaker 1>You're freaking out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

135
00:06:12.891 --> 00:06:15.380
<v Speaker 1>is it going to be a car accident?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is he going to be a fire?</v>

136
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Is going to be an earthquake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to be a slow aging death,</v>

137
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.410
<v Speaker 1>or is it going to be the chem trails?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

138
00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:26.580
<v Speaker 1>I think that type of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fear of dying is one of those </v>

139
00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.261
<v Speaker 1>fundamental things that every human is </v>
<v Speaker 1>Khalid wide with certain things that </v>

140
00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.620
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happens in the brain without them </v>

141
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:34.620
<v Speaker 1>thinking about and fear of dying and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fear of other things,</v>

142
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.280
<v Speaker 1>fear of loss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear of wolves or whatever.</v>

143
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.820
<v Speaker 1>Something that's hardwired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the type of thing that leads </v>

144
00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:43.090
<v Speaker 1>to different types of thinking that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

145
00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:48.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ended up being a conspiracy </v>

146
00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:48.610
<v Speaker 1>theorists in part because your brain is </v>
<v Speaker 1>wired that way.</v>

147
00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:53.410
<v Speaker 1>You had a great quote about chem trails </v>
<v Speaker 1>when we did that television show </v>

148
00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.561
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said Chem trails are like the </v>

149
00:06:56.561 --> 00:06:57.740
<v Speaker 1>training wheels for conspiracy theorists</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're like,</v>

150
00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:59.680
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're right above your head and you're</v>

151
00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.150
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see them right there for people.</v>

152
00:07:02.151 --> 00:07:07.040
<v Speaker 1>Don't understand why jets produce </v>
<v Speaker 1>clouds.</v>

153
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.350
<v Speaker 1>Please explain that because it's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>simple.</v>

154
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:13.700
<v Speaker 1>It is very simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A jet engines have water.</v>

155
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:18.830
<v Speaker 1>I have water in their exhaust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can look at a car on a cold day and </v>

156
00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:19.220
<v Speaker 1>you see the exhaust coming out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tailpipe.</v>

157
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:24.400
<v Speaker 1>You'll see like a cloud condensation </v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes and you'll see some water </v>

158
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.090
<v Speaker 1>coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when they,</v>

159
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.380
<v Speaker 1>the exact same thing happens with jet </v>
<v Speaker 1>engines.</v>

160
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.410
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when that exhaust hits,</v>

161
00:07:30.411 --> 00:07:32.450
<v Speaker 1>the colder it condenses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it freezes,</v>

162
00:07:32.451 --> 00:07:35.420
<v Speaker 1>it makes a cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Con controls are essentially,</v>

163
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:39.020
<v Speaker 1>clouds are exactly the same basically as</v>
<v Speaker 1>a regular service cloud.</v>

164
00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:42.620
<v Speaker 1>And it's dependent upon the amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>moisture in the atmosphere.</v>

165
00:07:42.621 --> 00:07:47.621
<v Speaker 1>And you can actually monitor it online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>NASA actually has a website that will </v>

166
00:07:47.621 --> 00:07:50.090
<v Speaker 1>show you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I believe it's set up for pilots,</v>

167
00:07:50.091 --> 00:07:55.091
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what the air traffic people are </v>

168
00:07:55.091 --> 00:07:57.590
<v Speaker 1>actually has a contrail forecasting side</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't really for pilots or anything.</v>

169
00:07:57.591 --> 00:08:00.110
<v Speaker 1>It's just part of the country research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

170
00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:05.170
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a site where it will predict </v>

171
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:05.170
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well controls.</v>

172
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:05.170
<v Speaker 1>They're going to baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do it yourself.</v>

173
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:06.980
<v Speaker 1>You just go to look up the relative </v>
<v Speaker 1>humidity at a certain altitude.</v>

174
00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:08.960
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of different sites you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>go to.</v>

175
00:08:08.961 --> 00:08:13.961
<v Speaker 1>I've got a whole bunch of them listed on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Medibank and just like the clouds very </v>

176
00:08:14.241 --> 00:08:19.241
<v Speaker 1>in the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the amount of moisture various as </v>

177
00:08:19.241 --> 00:08:20.240
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the reasons why you will</v>

178
00:08:20.241 --> 00:08:23.960
<v Speaker 1>see a jet pass through one area and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see a contrail.</v>

179
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:29.080
<v Speaker 1>And then it almost looks like they shut </v>
<v Speaker 1>the contrail jets off and then you see </v>

180
00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.920
<v Speaker 1>it pick up maybe a couple hundred yards </v>
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>

181
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:36.220
<v Speaker 1>And that's say like a cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really exactly the same as the </v>

182
00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.761
<v Speaker 1>cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at any picture of a cloudy </v>

183
00:08:39.761 --> 00:08:42.191
<v Speaker 1>day and then just remove all the clouds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're still there as an invisible </v>

184
00:08:42.191 --> 00:08:44.780
<v Speaker 1>clouds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then when the plane comes along,</v>

185
00:08:44.810 --> 00:08:49.810
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like the plane is this magic</v>
<v Speaker 1>pen revealing these invisible clouds </v>

186
00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:54.460
<v Speaker 1>because all the cloud is a region of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sky where the humidity is above a </v>

187
00:08:54.460 --> 00:08:55.410
<v Speaker 1>certain level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

188
00:08:55.411 --> 00:08:55.930
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

189
00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:01.160
<v Speaker 2>humidity's pretty patchy across the sky </v>
<v Speaker 2>cause like there's a cloud here and </v>

190
00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:01.260
<v Speaker 2>right next to it there's no cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So where the cloud is,</v>

191
00:09:01.261 --> 00:09:03.390
<v Speaker 2>it's high humidity where the cloud </v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't,</v>

192
00:09:03.391 --> 00:09:08.391
<v Speaker 2>is Loki meditate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if both of those were just lowered </v>

193
00:09:08.391 --> 00:09:10.910
<v Speaker 2>like 10 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you get no clouds at all than a </v>

194
00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:14.661
<v Speaker 2>plane comes along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She erases the humidity in the cloud </v>

195
00:09:14.661 --> 00:09:15.090
<v Speaker 2>area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ended the non-cloud area.</v>

196
00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.740
<v Speaker 2>But this area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it was a bit higher,</v>

197
00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:19.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a trail forming in this area,</v>

198
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:24.141
<v Speaker 2>getting a trail forming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's exactly the same as invisible </v>

199
00:09:24.141 --> 00:09:24.141
<v Speaker 2>clouds.</v>

200
00:09:24.141 --> 00:09:28.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And for people that are watching it and </v>

201
00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:31.221
<v Speaker 3>you're looking up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you think they're spraying something if </v>

202
00:09:31.221 --> 00:09:34.281
<v Speaker 3>you're conspiracy minded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And because of a lot of the videos that </v>

203
00:09:34.281 --> 00:09:37.851
<v Speaker 3>are out there in particular to that were</v>
<v Speaker 3>recommended to me are what in the hell </v>

204
00:09:37.851 --> 00:09:38.640
<v Speaker 3>have they sprang?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

205
00:09:38.641 --> 00:09:43.641
<v Speaker 3>So I got to meet with that guy that made</v>
<v Speaker 3>those documentaries and a right away I </v>

206
00:09:43.641 --> 00:09:47.931
<v Speaker 3>knew something was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he's either on adderall or </v>

207
00:09:47.931 --> 00:09:48.660
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's just like real,</v>

208
00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:53.640
<v Speaker 3>real edgy and speed it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just an odd guy,</v>

209
00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:58.880
<v Speaker 3>which is like a lot of people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy really conspiratorially </v>

210
00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:00.210
<v Speaker 3>minded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They seem to be like very.</v>

211
00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:02.890
<v Speaker 3>They're nervous and agitated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

212
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:08.270
<v Speaker 3>and when we went over like why he thinks</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that he was talking </v>

213
00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:11.481
<v Speaker 3>about was the soil samples and water </v>
<v Speaker 3>samples and that they've detected all </v>

214
00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:17.550
<v Speaker 3>this aluminum and barium in water and </v>
<v Speaker 3>particularly aluminum.</v>

215
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:20.370
<v Speaker 3>And he's showing me all these results </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he had.</v>

216
00:10:20.371 --> 00:10:22.470
<v Speaker 3>But even on the very results that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>showed me,</v>

217
00:10:22.471 --> 00:10:25.710
<v Speaker 3>it said sludge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he had sent them out for testing.</v>

218
00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:26.400
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

219
00:10:26.401 --> 00:10:28.140
<v Speaker 3>what did you send in his?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

220
00:10:28.141 --> 00:10:30.750
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sent some water from these ponds.</v>

221
00:10:30.990 --> 00:10:33.630
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it says sludge on your testing.</v>

222
00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:35.670
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody was water.</v>

223
00:10:35.671 --> 00:10:36.030
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

224
00:10:36.031 --> 00:10:38.490
<v Speaker 3>but the lab said it sludge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

225
00:10:38.491 --> 00:10:39.690
<v Speaker 3>what is sludge?</v>
<v Speaker 3>She goes,</v>

226
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.580
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what sludge is exactly.</v>

227
00:10:41.581 --> 00:10:41.910
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

228
00:10:41.911 --> 00:10:46.911
<v Speaker 3>let's look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sludge is a combination of water and </v>

229
00:10:46.911 --> 00:10:46.911
<v Speaker 3>dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

230
00:10:46.911 --> 00:10:50.481
<v Speaker 3>so you sent water and dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So do you know that aluminum is one of </v>

231
00:10:50.481 --> 00:10:54.501
<v Speaker 3>the most common metals on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you could basically scoop up a patch</v>

232
00:10:54.721 --> 00:10:57.660
<v Speaker 3>of dirt pretty much anywhere and find a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of aluminum in it.</v>

233
00:10:57.690 --> 00:11:00.390
<v Speaker 3>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really common in trace amounts.</v>

234
00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:05.960
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so what you did is you tested dirt and </v>

235
00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.370
<v Speaker 3>it tested positive for being dirt </v>
<v Speaker 3>musically.</v>

236
00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:10.890
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the guy was kind of freaking out.</v>

237
00:11:10.891 --> 00:11:11.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how did you,</v>

238
00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:14.490
<v Speaker 3>how did you not put this together </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself?</v>

239
00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:18.510
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're the guy who's making this</v>
<v Speaker 3>video and you're trying to find a reason</v>

240
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.630
<v Speaker 3>why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could know some facts that you could</v>

241
00:11:21.631 --> 00:11:22.630
<v Speaker 3>throw at people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could say,</v>

242
00:11:22.631 --> 00:11:27.631
<v Speaker 3>hey look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the government is definitely spraying </v>

243
00:11:27.631 --> 00:11:27.631
<v Speaker 3>things in the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're spraying them aluminum.</v>

244
00:11:27.631 --> 00:11:30.950
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we found the aluminum and we founded in </v>

245
00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:30.950
<v Speaker 3>the water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's in your water supply.</v>

246
00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:31.830
<v Speaker 3>It's going to get in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to poison you.</v>

247
00:11:31.831 --> 00:11:32.880
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we found in the water,</v>

248
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:38.530
<v Speaker 3>how did it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how the fuck did he not look at it </v>

249
00:11:38.530 --> 00:11:40.611
<v Speaker 3>himself is what I was thinking and meet </v>
<v Speaker 3>when me and him were having this </v>

250
00:11:40.611 --> 00:11:43.701
<v Speaker 3>conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I realized like you have these people </v>

251
00:11:43.701 --> 00:11:46.821
<v Speaker 3>that go down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not open minded in regards to </v>

252
00:11:46.821 --> 00:11:49.590
<v Speaker 3>these subjects.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They go down a very narrow road and that</v>

253
00:11:49.591 --> 00:11:53.130
<v Speaker 3>road is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the government is doing something to me.</v>

254
00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:54.190
<v Speaker 3>I need to find</v>

255
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:55.280
<v Speaker 1>out what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

256
00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.430
<v Speaker 1>And they're really motivated to actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>find evidence.</v>

257
00:11:57.460 --> 00:12:00.550
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that trying to find something and you</v>

258
00:12:00.570 --> 00:12:05.570
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually trying to find an alternative </v>

259
00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:05.570
<v Speaker 1>explanation isn't really that attracted </v>
<v Speaker 1>to them.</v>

260
00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:08.350
<v Speaker 1>So they find aluminum in the water or in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the soil or whatever.</v>

261
00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:13.590
<v Speaker 1>And then they glom onto that as being </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence of geoengineering and that's </v>

262
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:18.241
<v Speaker 1>great for them because they can just </v>
<v Speaker 1>find loads and loads of samples of soil </v>

263
00:12:18.241 --> 00:12:18.241
<v Speaker 1>and that's something that gets repeated </v>
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>

264
00:12:18.241 --> 00:12:23.190
<v Speaker 1>That very fact over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the aluminum that they found in the </v>

265
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:24.280
<v Speaker 1>water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the core tenants is like one</v>

266
00:12:24.281 --> 00:12:26.210
<v Speaker 1>of the pillars of the chem trail thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

267
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:31.230
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like four or five different </v>

268
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:31.230
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in every conspiracy theory,</v>

269
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:33.860
<v Speaker 1>there are these core beliefs that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

270
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.360
<v Speaker 1>the 99 percent of the people who believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the theory,</v>

271
00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:39.250
<v Speaker 1>one core belief is that you work for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

272
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:42.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a core belief.</v>

273
00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:45.520
<v Speaker 1>Make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a retired video game creator.</v>

274
00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:48.040
<v Speaker 1>You could find that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Made Video Games,</v>

275
00:12:48.041 --> 00:12:48.940
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tony Hawk.</v>

276
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:52.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Made a shit ton of money and decided to,</v>

277
00:12:52.121 --> 00:12:55.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to debunk dorks.</v>

278
00:12:55.610 --> 00:12:56.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>

279
00:12:56.011 --> 00:13:00.070
<v Speaker 1>It didn't start out and I wouldn't refer</v>
<v Speaker 1>to them as Dorks,</v>

280
00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:02.690
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying they're dorks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

281
00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:08.020
<v Speaker 1>Dorks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they don't believe this is the </v>

282
00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:08.020
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not a Dork.</v>

283
00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.400
<v Speaker 1>If you fall for something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a Dork.</v>

284
00:13:09.401 --> 00:13:12.850
<v Speaker 1>If you fall for something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't believe the science that shows</v>

285
00:13:12.851 --> 00:13:14.800
<v Speaker 1>that it's impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not real.</v>

286
00:13:14.801 --> 00:13:17.080
<v Speaker 1>But if you were spraying aluminum in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sky,</v>

287
00:13:17.081 --> 00:13:18.850
<v Speaker 1>folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would look like aluminum.</v>

288
00:13:18.851 --> 00:13:20.740
<v Speaker 1>You dummy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't look like a cloud.</v>

289
00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:25.920
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't dissipate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would look like a thin missed </v>

290
00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:25.920
<v Speaker 1>essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

291
00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:28.720
<v Speaker 1>and metal is not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's heavier than fucking air and vapor.</v>

292
00:13:28.721 --> 00:13:30.430
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to just sit up there like</v>

293
00:13:30.431 --> 00:13:30.760
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

294
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:32.970
<v Speaker 1>It would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be a very different experience.</v>

295
00:13:32.971 --> 00:13:37.971
<v Speaker 1>It has slowly settled to the ground and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't look like a cloud and there's </v>

296
00:13:37.971 --> 00:13:39.070
<v Speaker 1>no reason to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no benefit whatsoever.</v>

297
00:13:39.071 --> 00:13:44.071
<v Speaker 1>There's no scientific evidence ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>uncovered ever that there's any benefit </v>

298
00:13:44.071 --> 00:13:46.750
<v Speaker 1>for anybody of sprang aluminum over </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

299
00:13:46.751 --> 00:13:47.850
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

300
00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:49.740
<v Speaker 1>it's a waste of aluma thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even with the,</v>

301
00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:54.730
<v Speaker 1>the whole geoengineering field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's really no solid evidence that it</v>

302
00:13:54.731 --> 00:13:57.550
<v Speaker 1>will work and we don't know what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>side effects will be.</v>

303
00:13:57.610 --> 00:14:02.610
<v Speaker 1>We don't know how much we're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would need to spray and we don't </v>

304
00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:02.610
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

305
00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:02.610
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

306
00:14:02.610 --> 00:14:03.500
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you know,</v>

307
00:14:03.501 --> 00:14:07.000
<v Speaker 1>when we stopped doing it will bounce </v>
<v Speaker 1>back in a terrible way and it'd be a big</v>

308
00:14:07.001 --> 00:14:07.720
<v Speaker 1>disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

309
00:14:07.721 --> 00:14:12.721
<v Speaker 1>that's an interesting thing because one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the reasons why I'm contrary hills </v>

310
00:14:12.721 --> 00:14:17.250
<v Speaker 1>are interesting to study is because they</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually do have an effect on the </v>

311
00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:21.301
<v Speaker 1>temperature of the earth and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that we found out after nine </v>

312
00:14:21.301 --> 00:14:23.320
<v Speaker 1>slash 11 when September 11th happened in</v>
<v Speaker 1>2001,</v>

313
00:14:23.321 --> 00:14:23.950
<v Speaker 1>it was the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

314
00:14:23.990 --> 00:14:28.990
<v Speaker 1>the big disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a shutdown on all flights in </v>

315
00:14:29.471 --> 00:14:31.240
<v Speaker 1>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when they did that,</v>

316
00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:34.790
<v Speaker 1>the temperature changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

317
00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:40.020
<v Speaker 1>because is clouds literally do provide </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a cover and it is,</v>

318
00:14:41.101 --> 00:14:46.101
<v Speaker 1>it does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do they act as an insulator or an </v>

319
00:14:46.101 --> 00:14:46.101
<v Speaker 1>escalator?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

320
00:14:46.101 --> 00:14:50.641
<v Speaker 1>they essentially act as an insulator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They block a radiation incoming </v>

321
00:14:50.641 --> 00:14:51.500
<v Speaker 1>radiation during the day</v>

322
00:14:51.990 --> 00:14:54.380
<v Speaker 2>and they block outgoing radiation at </v>
<v Speaker 2>night.</v>

323
00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:59.860
<v Speaker 2>But the net effect is that they actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>block more outgoing radiation than they </v>

324
00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:03.941
<v Speaker 2>do incoming radiation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if planes didn't fly at night than </v>

325
00:15:04.330 --> 00:15:07.230
<v Speaker 2>you would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would cool the earth down a,</v>

326
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:10.000
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to stop flying quite a bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>before nighttime.</v>

327
00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:13.370
<v Speaker 2>So if all the flights in the world were </v>
<v Speaker 2>between like a 5:00</v>

328
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:15.170
<v Speaker 2>AM and 5:00</v>
<v Speaker 2>PM local time,</v>

329
00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:20.680
<v Speaker 2>then you could actually call the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>down by just not having any flights at </v>

330
00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:23.891
<v Speaker 2>night because if the night flights that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have this really big kind of blanketing </v>

331
00:15:23.891 --> 00:15:24.170
<v Speaker 2>effect that stopped being outgoing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>radiation.</v>

332
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.350
<v Speaker 2>So the night of flights actually heat </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world up.</v>

333
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:28.610
<v Speaker 2>Yes they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They act like a,</v>

334
00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:30.400
<v Speaker 2>like a blanket,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

335
00:15:30.590 --> 00:15:34.850
<v Speaker 2>you know how it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's warmer on a well in a cloudy day.</v>

336
00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.260
<v Speaker 2>Like he doesn't get as cold at night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

337
00:15:36.261 --> 00:15:38.530
<v Speaker 2>does it get really cold at night because</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing over them.</v>

338
00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:41.010
<v Speaker 2>They tend to have any,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any cover one.</v>

339
00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:42.530
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

340
00:15:42.531 --> 00:15:47.531
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the controls will actually a warm the </v>

341
00:15:47.531 --> 00:15:52.091
<v Speaker 2>planet because the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the amount of outgoing radiation they </v>

342
00:15:52.091 --> 00:15:56.661
<v Speaker 2>block is just way high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just go with the wave lengths and the </v>

343
00:15:56.661 --> 00:15:56.661
<v Speaker 2>size of the particles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That one.</v>

344
00:15:56.661 --> 00:15:58.780
<v Speaker 3>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's something to be concerned about,</v>

345
00:15:58.990 --> 00:16:01.780
<v Speaker 3>that that's something that people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>legitimately monitoring.</v>

346
00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:07.140
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when people need to understand is just </v>

347
00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:08.941
<v Speaker 3>because you feel like when you look up </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the sky and see this crisscross </v>

348
00:16:08.941 --> 00:16:09.340
<v Speaker 3>patterns that they're spraying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

349
00:16:09.341 --> 00:16:14.341
<v Speaker 3>one's spraying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is just a natural reaction to jet </v>

350
00:16:14.771 --> 00:16:18.820
<v Speaker 3>engines and condensation in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>atmosphere and the heat and the moisture</v>

351
00:16:18.821 --> 00:16:19.450
<v Speaker 3>of the jet engine.</v>

352
00:16:19.450 --> 00:16:20.570
<v Speaker 2>That's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There it,</v>

353
00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:25.620
<v Speaker 2>they are actually talking about a way of</v>
<v Speaker 2>using controls for a kind of Geo </v>

354
00:16:25.620 --> 00:16:29.061
<v Speaker 2>engineering and this is something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people often get confused about because </v>

355
00:16:29.061 --> 00:16:30.520
<v Speaker 2>you see these two words together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>controls and engineering and they think,</v>

356
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:31.360
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's chem trails,</v>

357
00:16:31.750 --> 00:16:36.750
<v Speaker 2>but what they're trying to do is use air</v>
<v Speaker 2>traffic control and computers and </v>

358
00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:40.951
<v Speaker 2>weather forecasting to make it so the </v>
<v Speaker 2>planes don't fly through the contrail </v>

359
00:16:40.951 --> 00:16:43.690
<v Speaker 2>forming areas when they would make </v>
<v Speaker 2>controls at night.</v>

360
00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:46.120
<v Speaker 2>I'm making.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they do fly route contrary or forming</v>

361
00:16:46.121 --> 00:16:49.300
<v Speaker 2>areas what it might make some trials </v>
<v Speaker 2>during the day.</v>

362
00:16:49.390 --> 00:16:52.360
<v Speaker 2>So this is a conversation they're having</v>
<v Speaker 2>or something that's actually being.</v>

363
00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:57.420
<v Speaker 2>It's not something that they've actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>done something that they can research </v>

364
00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:02.011
<v Speaker 2>fairly easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if they were considering trying to </v>

365
00:17:02.011 --> 00:17:04.450
<v Speaker 2>heat up the atmosphere or heat up the </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth at night,</v>

366
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:07.630
<v Speaker 2>they would just fly over these moisture </v>
<v Speaker 2>rich areas and if they weren't,</v>

367
00:17:07.631 --> 00:17:08.380
<v Speaker 2>they would avoid them.</v>

368
00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:13.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The goal obviously is to combat climate </v>

369
00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:16.501
<v Speaker 2>change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>global warming and cooling down so that </v>

370
00:17:16.501 --> 00:17:20.820
<v Speaker 2>a relatively cheap way of doing that to </v>
<v Speaker 2>a degree is to have these planes be </v>

371
00:17:21.881 --> 00:17:25.960
<v Speaker 2>controlled by computers and it could </v>
<v Speaker 2>increase his fuel costs,</v>

372
00:17:25.961 --> 00:17:30.961
<v Speaker 2>but the airline by about two or three </v>
<v Speaker 2>percent because they had to make very </v>

373
00:17:30.961 --> 00:17:33.220
<v Speaker 2>deviations sometimes in height and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes indirection,</v>

374
00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:38.790
<v Speaker 2>but it could actually have a significant</v>
<v Speaker 2>effect on the earth climate if we had </v>

375
00:17:38.790 --> 00:17:41.320
<v Speaker 2>the entire world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>airline fleets all in this program where</v>

376
00:17:41.321 --> 00:17:46.321
<v Speaker 2>they would fly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making controls where they were needed </v>

377
00:17:46.321 --> 00:17:46.321
<v Speaker 2>and not making contracts where they were</v>
<v Speaker 2>not needed</v>

378
00:17:46.321 --> 00:17:48.480
<v Speaker 3>and how exactly they're monitoring the </v>
<v Speaker 3>moisture content of the atmosphere.</v>

379
00:17:48.481 --> 00:17:50.370
<v Speaker 3>Like what are they to do that </v>
<v Speaker 3>satellites.</v>

380
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:51.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a combination of things.</v>

381
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:53.170
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

382
00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:58.460
<v Speaker 2>the youth sounding balloons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are these red weather balloons </v>

383
00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:01.641
<v Speaker 2>basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which got mistaken for Ufo is quite a </v>

384
00:18:01.641 --> 00:18:03.861
<v Speaker 2>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they use satellites and they use a </v>

385
00:18:03.861 --> 00:18:06.640
<v Speaker 2>planes a sensing the environment when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're flying through it and they use </v>

386
00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.650
<v Speaker 2>all these inputs and it goes into a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>computer model,</v>

387
00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:10.530
<v Speaker 2>which basically predicts where the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

388
00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:11.630
<v Speaker 2>what the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

389
00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:15.840
<v Speaker 2>humidity will be at any particular point</v>
<v Speaker 2>is basically a big weather forecast.</v>

390
00:18:15.841 --> 00:18:16.680
<v Speaker 2>But the upper atmosphere</v>

391
00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:21.820
<v Speaker 1>now jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google Cei a admits Geo engineering </v>

392
00:18:22.890 --> 00:18:27.890
<v Speaker 1>because this is one that the cabot trail</v>
<v Speaker 1>believers constantly bring up.</v>

393
00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:33.760
<v Speaker 1>It was a conversation that I'm some guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the CIA had at some meeting where </v>

394
00:18:35.421 --> 00:18:39.260
<v Speaker 1>they were discussing potential future </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways,</v>

395
00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.360
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to use geo engineering.</v>

396
00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:42.650
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's play with this.</v>

397
00:18:42.730 --> 00:18:45.290
<v Speaker 1>Guys has CIA director,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Brennan,</v>

398
00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:51.420
<v Speaker 4>go ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>often referred to collectively as Geo </v>

399
00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.061
<v Speaker 4>engineering that potentially could help </v>
<v Speaker 4>reverse the warming effects of global </v>

400
00:18:54.061 --> 00:18:58.111
<v Speaker 4>climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One that has gained my personal </v>

401
00:18:58.111 --> 00:19:00.150
<v Speaker 4>attention is stratospheric aerosol </v>
<v Speaker 4>injection or Sai,</v>

402
00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:04.480
<v Speaker 4>a method of seeding the stratosphere </v>
<v Speaker 4>with particles that can help reflect the</v>

403
00:19:04.481 --> 00:19:09.481
<v Speaker 4>sun's heat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And much the same way that volcanic </v>

404
00:19:09.481 --> 00:19:12.270
<v Speaker 4>eruptions do in Sai program could limit </v>
<v Speaker 4>global temperature increases,</v>

405
00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:17.760
<v Speaker 4>reducing some risks associated with </v>
<v Speaker 4>higher temperatures and providing the </v>

406
00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:17.760
<v Speaker 4>wires that are freaking out.</v>

407
00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:23.460
<v Speaker 1>Keep changing back to to youtube glitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to refresh the page and I didn't </v>

408
00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:25.450
<v Speaker 1>want to restart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy had epilepsy?</v>

409
00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:28.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spheric.</v>

410
00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:29.600
<v Speaker 1>Eris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

411
00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:31.610
<v Speaker 1>Go ahead and just take it from where he </v>
<v Speaker 1>left it here.</v>

412
00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:32.270
<v Speaker 1>What else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What else?</v>

413
00:19:32.271 --> 00:19:32.810
<v Speaker 1>He has to say?</v>

414
00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:38.490
<v Speaker 4>Injection or s a I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A method of seeding the stratosphere </v>

415
00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:42.931
<v Speaker 4>with particles that can help reflect the</v>
<v Speaker 4>sun's heat in much the same way that </v>

416
00:19:42.931 --> 00:19:46.651
<v Speaker 4>volcanic eruptions do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>An Sai program could limit global </v>

417
00:19:46.651 --> 00:19:51.361
<v Speaker 4>temperature increases,</v>
<v Speaker 4>reducing some risks associated with </v>

418
00:19:51.361 --> 00:19:54.631
<v Speaker 4>higher temperatures and providing the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world economy additional time to </v>

419
00:19:54.631 --> 00:19:58.441
<v Speaker 4>transition from fossil fuels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This process is also relatively </v>

420
00:19:58.441 --> 00:20:02.521
<v Speaker 4>inexpensive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The National Research Research Council </v>

421
00:20:02.521 --> 00:20:05.491
<v Speaker 4>estimates that are fully deployed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sai Program would cost about </v>

422
00:20:05.491 --> 00:20:08.790
<v Speaker 4>$10,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>yearly as promising as it may be moving </v>

423
00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:12.130
<v Speaker 4>forward on sai would also raise a number</v>
<v Speaker 4>of challenges for our government and for</v>

424
00:20:12.131 --> 00:20:15.040
<v Speaker 4>the international community.</v>
<v Speaker 4>On the technical side,</v>

425
00:20:15.130 --> 00:20:20.130
<v Speaker 4>greenhouse gas emission reductions would</v>
<v Speaker 4>still have to accompany sai to address </v>

426
00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:23.290
<v Speaker 4>other climate change effects such as </v>
<v Speaker 4>ocean acidification,</v>

427
00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:28.620
<v Speaker 4>because sai alone would not remove </v>
<v Speaker 4>greenhouse gases from the atmosphere on </v>

428
00:20:28.661 --> 00:20:33.661
<v Speaker 4>the geopolitical side,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their technologies potential to alter </v>

429
00:20:33.661 --> 00:20:37.291
<v Speaker 4>weather patterns and benefit certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>regions of the world at the expense of </v>

430
00:20:37.291 --> 00:20:41.760
<v Speaker 4>other regions could trigger sharp </v>
<v Speaker 4>opposition by some nations others might </v>

431
00:20:42.401 --> 00:20:46.870
<v Speaker 4>seize on SSI benefits and back away from</v>
<v Speaker 4>their commitment to carbon dioxide.</v>

432
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.440
<v Speaker 4>And as with other breakthrough </v>
<v Speaker 4>technologies,</v>

433
00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:55.620
<v Speaker 4>global norms and standards are lacking </v>
<v Speaker 4>to guide the deployment and </v>

434
00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:56.380
<v Speaker 4>implementation of Sai and otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>

435
00:20:56.520 --> 00:21:01.520
<v Speaker 2>We get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this guy is talking about an idea of </v>

436
00:21:02.671 --> 00:21:07.170
<v Speaker 2>spraying things in the atmosphere to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

437
00:21:07.310 --> 00:21:12.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's talking about geoengineering </v>

438
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:12.310
<v Speaker 2>spraying stuff from playing was talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

439
00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:13.710
<v Speaker 2>He's talking about reflective particles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

440
00:21:13.711 --> 00:21:15.150
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

441
00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:20.240
<v Speaker 2>The spray sulfur dioxide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which isn't exactly a reflective </v>

442
00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:23.871
<v Speaker 2>protocol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it acts as a nucleus for a </v>

443
00:21:23.871 --> 00:21:23.970
<v Speaker 2>parameter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Speyer clouds and things like that.</v>

444
00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:25.650
<v Speaker 2>It's basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

445
00:21:25.651 --> 00:21:28.610
<v Speaker 2>the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A volcano does what a volcano erupt.</v>

446
00:21:28.700 --> 00:21:33.700
<v Speaker 2>It spews a whole bunch of sulfur dioxide</v>
<v Speaker 2>and various other things into the upper </v>

447
00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:36.270
<v Speaker 2>atmosphere and that creates hayes </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically,</v>

448
00:21:36.271 --> 00:21:41.271
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which blocks the incoming radiation and </v>

449
00:21:41.271 --> 00:21:42.780
<v Speaker 2>cools things down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time a big volcano goes off,</v>

450
00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:46.600
<v Speaker 2>you see a little dip in the earth's </v>
<v Speaker 2>temperature because of this,</v>

451
00:21:46.601 --> 00:21:51.601
<v Speaker 2>this blocking effect that and so the </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory is that you could do something </v>

452
00:21:51.601 --> 00:21:53.490
<v Speaker 2>similar and you could do it by spreading</v>
<v Speaker 2>things out of planes,</v>

453
00:21:53.970 --> 00:21:58.970
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's talking about things that we might </v>

454
00:21:58.970 --> 00:21:58.970
<v Speaker 2>do in the future.</v>

455
00:21:58.970 --> 00:21:59.970
<v Speaker 2>You see every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every year he uses the future tense,</v>

456
00:21:59.971 --> 00:22:02.100
<v Speaker 2>like we could do this in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They may do this,</v>

457
00:22:02.101 --> 00:22:07.101
<v Speaker 2>the effects might be this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's talking about the possible </v>

458
00:22:07.101 --> 00:22:09.450
<v Speaker 2>geopolitical impacts of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are very significant,</v>

459
00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:14.480
<v Speaker 2>like if one country is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>spraying something that would cause the </v>

460
00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:18.830
<v Speaker 2>say the monsoons to double in intensity </v>
<v Speaker 2>or to have and intensity in India.</v>

461
00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:24.740
<v Speaker 2>That could cause the deaths of millions </v>
<v Speaker 2>of people from famine and flooding and </v>

462
00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:29.691
<v Speaker 2>this is what people think has happened </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the big hurricanes in the United </v>

463
00:22:29.691 --> 00:22:33.440
<v Speaker 2>States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do think that there's no evidence </v>

464
00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.571
<v Speaker 2>of that actually happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the pattern of hurricanes is pretty </v>

465
00:22:35.571 --> 00:22:36.870
<v Speaker 2>much the same as it's been for a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

466
00:22:36.871 --> 00:22:39.000
<v Speaker 2>When you look at the statistical </v>
<v Speaker 2>variations,</v>

467
00:22:39.001 --> 00:22:39.650
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

468
00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:44.660
<v Speaker 2>maybe a bit more intense because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>oceans are a bit warmer where it's not </v>

469
00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:45.100
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

470
00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:50.690
<v Speaker 2>people think that hurricanes have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>steered a harp.</v>

471
00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:51.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>through harp,</v>

472
00:22:52.020 --> 00:22:53.970
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't make any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is,</v>

473
00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.390
<v Speaker 2>there are ways that do make sense which </v>
<v Speaker 2>are a cloud seeding.</v>

474
00:22:57.810 --> 00:23:02.810
<v Speaker 2>Like if you do lots of seeding of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hurricane on one side you could perhaps </v>

475
00:23:02.810 --> 00:23:07.790
<v Speaker 2>reduce the amount of humidity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>moisture on that side and so it will </v>

476
00:23:08.291 --> 00:23:10.500
<v Speaker 2>kind of turn a little bit more and move </v>
<v Speaker 2>over to one side.</v>

477
00:23:10.501 --> 00:23:15.501
<v Speaker 2>So there are ways that you might work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they did actually experiment with </v>

478
00:23:15.501 --> 00:23:17.310
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think back in the seventies or so,</v>

479
00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:20.610
<v Speaker 2>there was one experiment where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>tried seeding a hurricane,</v>

480
00:23:20.611 --> 00:23:25.611
<v Speaker 2>but he ended up going somewhere else </v>
<v Speaker 2>other than where the were they intended </v>

481
00:23:25.611 --> 00:23:27.840
<v Speaker 2>and it destroyed a whole bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>houses.</v>

482
00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:33.200
<v Speaker 2>The problem with having a video like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is that this guy is admitting that </v>

483
00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:37.140
<v Speaker 2>they have looked into potentially spring</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

484
00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:40.020
<v Speaker 2>No one has ever denied that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've been,</v>

485
00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:42.780
<v Speaker 2>we've been looking into geo engineering </v>
<v Speaker 2>for decades.</v>

486
00:23:42.781 --> 00:23:45.410
<v Speaker 2>It's been proposed like in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

487
00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.100
<v Speaker 2>in some sense</v>

488
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:49.220
<v Speaker 1>we're over 100 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other since the seventies.</v>

489
00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:53.480
<v Speaker 1>The other problem is he cave that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gave it a initials as a Pi.</v>

490
00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:55.760
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People love initials.</v>

491
00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.490
<v Speaker 1>They love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's super exciting.</v>

492
00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:00.740
<v Speaker 1>Not even really well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people use the srm,</v>

493
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:01.810
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

494
00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:05.210
<v Speaker 1>the solar radiation management.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

495
00:24:05.240 --> 00:24:06.610
<v Speaker 1>that's a good one too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

496
00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:11.200
<v Speaker 1>I saw as a CIA dea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's okay.</v>

497
00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:12.340
<v Speaker 1>Sounds good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That sounds.</v>

498
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:16.550
<v Speaker 1>Sounds more scary than Dziedzic aerosol </v>
<v Speaker 1>injection.</v>

499
00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:22.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they would have to be studies and </v>

500
00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:22.350
<v Speaker 1>has to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are,</v>

501
00:24:22.351 --> 00:24:23.990
<v Speaker 1>there are lots of studies going on right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

502
00:24:23.991 --> 00:24:26.010
<v Speaker 1>There are people are studying </v>
<v Speaker 1>geoengineering.</v>

503
00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:29.300
<v Speaker 1>There's actually lots of people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>specialize in Geo engineering.</v>

504
00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:32.120
<v Speaker 1>While I was going to say is studies </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have to be available for people to</v>

505
00:24:32.121 --> 00:24:34.520
<v Speaker 1>understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nobody wants to do that.</v>

506
00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:38.180
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants to go in and you wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>look up and see the thing behind the jet</v>

507
00:24:38.181 --> 00:24:38.420
<v Speaker 1>and go.</v>

508
00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:40.420
<v Speaker 1>They started it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're spraying this patchwork.</v>

509
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:42.350
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this haze all over us.</v>

510
00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:47.380
<v Speaker 1>Which does happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can have a clear sky and you have </v>

511
00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:50.501
<v Speaker 1>the right conditions in a bunch of jets </v>
<v Speaker 1>fly over and all the sudden it's very </v>

512
00:24:50.501 --> 00:24:50.501
<v Speaker 1>hazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does,</v>

513
00:24:50.501 --> 00:24:53.950
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the type of thing that's </v>

514
00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:53.950
<v Speaker 1>being reported since the Second World </v>
<v Speaker 1>War or even even earlier,</v>

515
00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:55.760
<v Speaker 1>either first contract that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>spreading out into clouds.</v>

516
00:24:55.761 --> 00:24:57.740
<v Speaker 1>We reported in like the 19 twenties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

517
00:24:57.741 --> 00:25:01.100
<v Speaker 1>well I took some of these photos and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>put them up.</v>

518
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:06.310
<v Speaker 1>I think the last time we had this </v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation where you could see them </v>

519
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:09.281
<v Speaker 1>from World War II,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see these jets and they see the </v>

520
00:25:09.281 --> 00:25:10.880
<v Speaker 1>contract falls behind the jets and the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But some people.</v>

521
00:25:10.881 --> 00:25:13.250
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing is con trails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

522
00:25:13.490 --> 00:25:15.620
<v Speaker 1>dissipate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But chem trail stay.</v>

523
00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:19.220
<v Speaker 1>Well that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You misunderstand what happens.</v>

524
00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:22.430
<v Speaker 1>The contrail stay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there's more moisture,</v>

525
00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:24.980
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the conditions are correct,</v>

526
00:25:24.981 --> 00:25:25.640
<v Speaker 1>they stay.</v>

527
00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:30.640
<v Speaker 1>And if the conditions are barely enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make a contrary to dissipate fairly </v>

528
00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.180
<v Speaker 1>rapidly with that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kind of use circular logic.</v>

529
00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:37.240
<v Speaker 1>And if I ask them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you think that controls a </v>

530
00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:38.060
<v Speaker 1>dissipate in Kentrell stay and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I can see it,</v>

531
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:43.330
<v Speaker 1>if you look up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at the chem trails and the </v>

532
00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:45.341
<v Speaker 1>staging and the country also dissipating</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of how do you know which is </v>

533
00:25:45.341 --> 00:25:45.341
<v Speaker 1>which?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

534
00:25:45.341 --> 00:25:45.890
<v Speaker 1>the country also the ones that </v>
<v Speaker 1>dissipate.</v>

535
00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:51.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they don't have any basis for that </v>

536
00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:51.200
<v Speaker 1>belief.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

537
00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:53.030
<v Speaker 1>the one thing I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you've probably seen is that video</v>

538
00:25:53.031 --> 00:25:57.650
<v Speaker 1>where I go through all my old books on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the weather and I look up in each one</v>

539
00:25:57.651 --> 00:26:02.651
<v Speaker 1>of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the section on contract and I read the </v>

540
00:26:02.651 --> 00:26:04.580
<v Speaker 1>bit in a contrail processed per hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes control,</v>

541
00:26:04.581 --> 00:26:08.480
<v Speaker 1>sometimes spread out to cover the sky </v>
<v Speaker 1>contrary last a long time.</v>

542
00:26:08.810 --> 00:26:13.810
<v Speaker 1>And I go back from these books from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>1998 all the way back to the 19 fifties.</v>

543
00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:19.810
<v Speaker 1>And I've got books in the 19 forties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you show people the actual books </v>

544
00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:24.670
<v Speaker 1>is a really powerful way of getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>through to them because they just </v>

545
00:26:24.670 --> 00:26:26.030
<v Speaker 1>assumed that controls campuses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

546
00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:31.330
<v Speaker 1>And they've assumed that this is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>recent phenomenon because they don't </v>

547
00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:34.271
<v Speaker 1>remember it clearly weren't paying </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention what the people don't notice </v>

548
00:26:34.271 --> 00:26:38.500
<v Speaker 1>them until you're 90 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't notice Cantrell's until </v>

549
00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:40.220
<v Speaker 1>they hear about the chem trail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conspiracy theory.</v>

550
00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.530
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will hear about it.</v>

551
00:26:42.531 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 1>And then the day they will go</v>

552
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:46.980
<v Speaker 2>outside and look at the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that's the first time that ever</v>

553
00:26:46.981 --> 00:26:51.981
<v Speaker 2>notice these controls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even the people that are like the high </v>

554
00:26:51.981 --> 00:26:51.981
<v Speaker 2>ups in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

555
00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:55.530
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the country movement,</v>

556
00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:59.490
<v Speaker 2>they only notice them when they hear </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the theory.</v>

557
00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:01.030
<v Speaker 2>There's a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

558
00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:04.040
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember his name now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he lived in San Diego and he,</v>

559
00:27:04.041 --> 00:27:07.920
<v Speaker 2>he never noticed them until like 2014.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he lived there all his life.</v>

560
00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:09.990
<v Speaker 2>And now he's publishing scientific </v>
<v Speaker 2>papers.</v>

561
00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:12.360
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jay Marvin Herndon is his name.</v>

562
00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:17.510
<v Speaker 2>He's publishing these scientific papers </v>
<v Speaker 2>about how the sprain slash like the </v>

563
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:19.530
<v Speaker 2>waste products of burning coal and power</v>
<v Speaker 2>stations.</v>

564
00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:24.560
<v Speaker 2>The spray that in the upper atmosphere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's actually got like three or four </v>

565
00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:26.970
<v Speaker 2>papers published in these kind of pay to</v>
<v Speaker 2>publish a scientific journals.</v>

566
00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:30.540
<v Speaker 2>And that's kind of becoming a bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

567
00:27:30.541 --> 00:27:32.940
<v Speaker 2>I like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing with Brennan,</v>

568
00:27:32.970 --> 00:27:35.730
<v Speaker 2>the CIA guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People bring that up all the time,</v>

569
00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:36.810
<v Speaker 2>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time.</v>

570
00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:39.360
<v Speaker 2>And you just have to explain it to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

571
00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:41.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what he's talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The future use.</v>

572
00:27:42.150 --> 00:27:43.150
<v Speaker 2>And then this guy</v>

573
00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:48.550
<v Speaker 3>talking about possible solutions for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For global warming.</v>

574
00:27:48.570 --> 00:27:53.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now the problem with it is when he's </v>

575
00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:56.611
<v Speaker 3>talking about possible solutions and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then people look up and they see these </v>

576
00:27:56.611 --> 00:28:00.511
<v Speaker 3>actual clouds that are created by jets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They assumed this has already begun at </v>

577
00:28:00.511 --> 00:28:05.220
<v Speaker 3>the government would not tell us about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it because they don't understand the </v>

578
00:28:05.220 --> 00:28:07.630
<v Speaker 3>difference between contrary and with </v>
<v Speaker 3>this stuff would look like.</v>

579
00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:08.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

580
00:28:08.530 --> 00:28:11.200
<v Speaker 3>And just the fact that contract look </v>
<v Speaker 3>like this,</v>

581
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:16.630
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they heard the contrail shouldn't </v>

582
00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:19.051
<v Speaker 3>persist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well what's another thing that drove me </v>

583
00:28:19.051 --> 00:28:19.051
<v Speaker 3>crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

584
00:28:19.051 --> 00:28:22.080
<v Speaker 3>if you really want to worry about health</v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences of these things that you </v>

585
00:28:22.571 --> 00:28:25.810
<v Speaker 3>see in the sky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a reality to it.</v>

586
00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:30.840
<v Speaker 3>The reality is they're burning jet fuel </v>
<v Speaker 3>and all the people that live around the </v>

587
00:28:30.840 --> 00:28:32.350
<v Speaker 3>airports get sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's.</v>

588
00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:37.380
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's high levels of respiratory </v>

589
00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:39.871
<v Speaker 3>illness that are associated with living </v>
<v Speaker 3>within a certain distance of airplanes </v>

590
00:28:39.871 --> 00:28:42.790
<v Speaker 3>or airports.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're in a congested hub like lax,</v>

591
00:28:43.210 --> 00:28:46.900
<v Speaker 3>don't buy a house like a block away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not good for your health.</v>

592
00:28:46.901 --> 00:28:51.901
<v Speaker 3>They're burning jet fuel that's going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get in the air pollution pollution from </v>

593
00:28:51.901 --> 00:28:52.270
<v Speaker 3>cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

594
00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:57.600
<v Speaker 3>it's even more intense because you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>having thousands and thousands of giant </v>

595
00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:57.600
<v Speaker 3>planes.</v>

596
00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.360
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] even less smoke Santa </v>
<v Speaker 2>Monica,</v>

597
00:28:59.390 --> 00:29:04.390
<v Speaker 2>they have problems with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the houses just at the </v>

598
00:29:04.390 --> 00:29:07.750
<v Speaker 2>end of Santa Monica runway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is right next to the end of the </v>

599
00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:10.940
<v Speaker 2>runway disease houses that did tests </v>
<v Speaker 2>with various metal particulars and stuff</v>

600
00:29:10.941 --> 00:29:12.650
<v Speaker 2>and the ones right by the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>runway,</v>

601
00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:14.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get to get pollution.</v>

602
00:29:14.670 --> 00:29:16.200
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very real problems.</v>

603
00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:17.660
<v Speaker 3>That's the real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

604
00:29:17.730 --> 00:29:22.730
<v Speaker 3>and that's a real one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now imagine if that was something that </v>

605
00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:25.371
<v Speaker 3>the government was engineering,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they really were engineering </v>

606
00:29:25.371 --> 00:29:28.431
<v Speaker 3>spraying things to give people </v>
<v Speaker 3>respiratory illness so that the hospital</v>

607
00:29:28.651 --> 00:29:32.130
<v Speaker 3>industry could profit and whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason was.</v>

608
00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:33.630
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be,</v>

609
00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:35.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that people could be concerned</v>

610
00:29:35.461 --> 00:29:35.790
<v Speaker 3>with.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

611
00:29:35.791 --> 00:29:40.791
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a real connection between </v>

612
00:29:40.791 --> 00:29:41.770
<v Speaker 3>airplanes and illnesses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not spraying in the Scott,</v>

613
00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:46.860
<v Speaker 3>that's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I understand people love these things </v>

614
00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:47.860
<v Speaker 3>and I understand people don't trust the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>

615
00:29:47.861 --> 00:29:49.420
<v Speaker 3>Those things completely make sense to </v>
<v Speaker 3>me,</v>

616
00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:53.020
<v Speaker 3>but you got to pay attention to what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>real and what's not real,</v>

617
00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:58.050
<v Speaker 3>because as soon as you don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then all the real stuff that the </v>

618
00:29:58.050 --> 00:29:58.050
<v Speaker 3>government does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the real stuff.</v>

619
00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:02.971
<v Speaker 3>The government does like these fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>roads they're going to build in Alaska </v>

620
00:30:02.971 --> 00:30:07.441
<v Speaker 3>right now through dangerous areas where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where they have a salmon rivers where </v>

621
00:30:07.441 --> 00:30:08.890
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna they're gonna start doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>mining.</v>

622
00:30:08.891 --> 00:30:10.420
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the Pebble Beach?</v>

623
00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:11.660
<v Speaker 3>Is that the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

624
00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:13.120
<v Speaker 3>what is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

625
00:30:13.390 --> 00:30:18.390
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the big mining issue in Alaska that is </v>

626
00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:19.360
<v Speaker 3>going on right now.</v>

627
00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:21.450
<v Speaker 2>Bristol Bay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bristol Bay.</v>

628
00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.460
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't I</v>

629
00:30:23.730 --> 00:30:28.730
<v Speaker 3>pebble in Bristol?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how I got those two </v>

630
00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:28.730
<v Speaker 3>confused pebble mine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what it is.</v>

631
00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:33.500
<v Speaker 3>And they want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to do this and it's near a </v>

632
00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:37.161
<v Speaker 3>major salmon area or these salmon river </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're people that live.</v>

633
00:30:37.201 --> 00:30:39.330
<v Speaker 3>They're terrified that they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do this.</v>

634
00:30:39.331 --> 00:30:44.331
<v Speaker 3>This is a real for profit thing where </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're putting the environment at risk </v>

635
00:30:46.140 --> 00:30:51.140
<v Speaker 3>that's real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so this is something that people should </v>

636
00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:51.140
<v Speaker 3>be concerned about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're not.</v>

637
00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:52.110
<v Speaker 3>They don't get concerned about those </v>
<v Speaker 3>kinds of things.</v>

638
00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:54.490
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>environmentalists do and you know,</v>

639
00:30:54.491 --> 00:30:57.720
<v Speaker 3>big conservationist do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the conspiracy theorists don't.</v>

640
00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:59.310
<v Speaker 3>They don't look at that and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

641
00:30:59.311 --> 00:31:04.311
<v Speaker 3>here's clear evidence of the government </v>
<v Speaker 3>being in bed with enormous businesses </v>

642
00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:10.070
<v Speaker 3>that stand a profit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spectacular amounts of money from </v>

643
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:12.960
<v Speaker 3>risking the environment and risking </v>
<v Speaker 3>these very delicate salmon fisheries.</v>

644
00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:18.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That type of thing is the exact reason </v>

645
00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:20.650
<v Speaker 2>why I still spend so much time debunking</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff like conspiracy theories because I</v>

646
00:31:20.651 --> 00:31:24.550
<v Speaker 2>think that so much a of conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 2>theories,</v>

647
00:31:24.551 --> 00:31:27.940
<v Speaker 2>the results of the effect of conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 2>theories is distracting people from real</v>

648
00:31:27.941 --> 00:31:28.940
<v Speaker 2>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some real issue.</v>

649
00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:30.190
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

650
00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:31.300
<v Speaker 2>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you say,</v>

651
00:31:31.301 --> 00:31:32.800
<v Speaker 2>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the airplane stuff,</v>

652
00:31:32.801 --> 00:31:35.590
<v Speaker 2>like if people are thinking that </v>
<v Speaker 2>spraying chemicals out of the bed to the</v>

653
00:31:35.650 --> 00:31:40.650
<v Speaker 2>back of the airplanes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just not gonna be worried about </v>

654
00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:43.110
<v Speaker 2>a regular pollution and if they think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the controlling the climate </v>

655
00:31:43.781 --> 00:31:48.781
<v Speaker 2>already,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not going to worry about any </v>

656
00:31:48.781 --> 00:31:48.781
<v Speaker 2>type of global warming.</v>

657
00:31:48.781 --> 00:31:52.880
<v Speaker 3>So let's find a one that we disagree on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you believe the official story </v>

658
00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:55.560
<v Speaker 3>of the JFK assassination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you more or less.</v>

659
00:31:55.561 --> 00:31:56.460
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more or less.</v>

660
00:31:57.180 --> 00:32:01.170
<v Speaker 3>My belief in this is this changes over </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

661
00:32:01.230 --> 00:32:03.870
<v Speaker 3>I think that Lee Harvey Oswald was in on</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

662
00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:09.320
<v Speaker 3>I think he was a part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think there were multiple people </v>

663
00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:09.320
<v Speaker 3>that were in on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I believe.</v>

664
00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:11.040
<v Speaker 3>Do you think the multiple shooters?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

665
00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:16.130
<v Speaker 3>And one of the reasons why I believe </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is because of the formation of the </v>

666
00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:19.071
<v Speaker 3>single bullet theory in the single </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullet theory was formed because the </v>

667
00:32:19.071 --> 00:32:22.590
<v Speaker 3>fact that they had to account for one </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullet that hit the underpass ricocheted</v>

668
00:32:22.591 --> 00:32:25.260
<v Speaker 3>off and put some man in the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

669
00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:30.560
<v Speaker 3>and that before that they did not have </v>
<v Speaker 3>an explanation for why all of these </v>

670
00:32:31.321 --> 00:32:36.321
<v Speaker 3>bullets bullet holes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these wounds were in all these </v>

671
00:32:36.321 --> 00:32:36.321
<v Speaker 3>different people's bodies.</v>

672
00:32:36.321 --> 00:32:40.700
<v Speaker 3>The other reason why I'm inclined to </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe there's a conspiracy was the </v>

673
00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:43.870
<v Speaker 3>fact that they found that bullet on </v>
<v Speaker 3>Connolly's Gurney when they brought him </v>

674
00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:44.630
<v Speaker 3>into the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's too convenient.</v>

675
00:32:44.810 --> 00:32:47.000
<v Speaker 3>And the bullet itself is fairly </v>
<v Speaker 3>pristine.</v>

676
00:32:47.270 --> 00:32:52.270
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowing as much as I know about bullets </v>

677
00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:53.710
<v Speaker 3>from personal experience of hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can hit anything with the boy.</v>

678
00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:55.640
<v Speaker 3>I pulled a lot of bullets out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>

679
00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:57.680
<v Speaker 3>When you shoot an animal and you hit </v>
<v Speaker 3>bone,</v>

680
00:32:58.070 --> 00:33:01.610
<v Speaker 3>those bullets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they distort brutally.</v>

681
00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:03.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't look like that.</v>

682
00:33:03.311 --> 00:33:05.990
<v Speaker 3>And if they go through to people and hit</v>
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of bone,</v>

683
00:33:06.170 --> 00:33:10.370
<v Speaker 3>that's the bullet that came out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Connolly's body or connolly's Gurney,</v>

684
00:33:10.371 --> 00:33:15.371
<v Speaker 3>excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's the bullet that they are </v>

685
00:33:15.371 --> 00:33:15.371
<v Speaker 3>attributing to this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a single bullet theory.</v>

686
00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:20.580
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you look at the path of the bullet </v>

687
00:33:20.580 --> 00:33:23.380
<v Speaker 3>that goes through connolly or goes </v>
<v Speaker 3>through Kennedy and then goes through </v>

688
00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:23.530
<v Speaker 3>connelly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that to me is,</v>

689
00:33:23.890 --> 00:33:26.600
<v Speaker 3>is not unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not unbelievable.</v>

690
00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:27.790
<v Speaker 2>That one is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

691
00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:28.810
<v Speaker 2>you've got to look at the other one,</v>

692
00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:30.040
<v Speaker 3>but even that one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no,</v>

693
00:33:30.041 --> 00:33:31.040
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See what I'm saying.</v>

694
00:33:31.041 --> 00:33:36.041
<v Speaker 3>Even that one is not unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is believable to me because I know </v>

695
00:33:36.041 --> 00:33:37.880
<v Speaker 3>that bullets do strange things when they</v>
<v Speaker 3>hit things</v>

696
00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:42.920
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you've got to combine that with the </v>

697
00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:42.920
<v Speaker 2>fact that the bullet came out fairly </v>
<v Speaker 2>pristine,</v>

698
00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:46.641
<v Speaker 2>which meant it didn't actually go </v>
<v Speaker 2>through a kind of a bouncy path like </v>

699
00:33:46.641 --> 00:33:46.641
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It went through a straight path.</v>

700
00:33:46.641 --> 00:33:49.380
<v Speaker 2>This diagram is from a conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 2>theorist,</v>

701
00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:50.490
<v Speaker 2>but essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

702
00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:54.120
<v Speaker 2>But the thing of the diagrams that will </v>
<v Speaker 2>show the actual path with him,</v>

703
00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:54.390
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

704
00:33:54.530 --> 00:33:58.170
<v Speaker 2>they've got them the butts that are on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same level and you know that Kennedy</v>

705
00:33:58.171 --> 00:33:59.640
<v Speaker 2>was actually sitting here was ella </v>
<v Speaker 2>bullied?</v>

706
00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:00.180
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

707
00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:01.220
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

708
00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:06.230
<v Speaker 3>see if we can find one that has the </v>
<v Speaker 3>actual seating arrangement or more </v>

709
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:07.220
<v Speaker 3>accurate seating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They will.</v>

710
00:34:07.221 --> 00:34:09.690
<v Speaker 3>They will one right there with the red </v>
<v Speaker 3>line and the right hand side.</v>

711
00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:12.360
<v Speaker 3>The one the right hand side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a more accurate.</v>

712
00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:14.820
<v Speaker 3>I'm from above.</v>
<v Speaker 3>From above,</v>

713
00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:15.790
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

714
00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:19.860
<v Speaker 3>there's also the fact that there was </v>
<v Speaker 3>particles,</v>

715
00:34:20.310 --> 00:34:22.950
<v Speaker 3>there was more metallic particles from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the bullets,</v>

716
00:34:22.951 --> 00:34:25.740
<v Speaker 3>more fragments from the bullet in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Conley's body.</v>

717
00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:30.450
<v Speaker 3>Then we're missing from the bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do not believe that was the bullet and</v>

718
00:34:30.451 --> 00:34:32.820
<v Speaker 3>I think that that is a very reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 3>assumption.</v>

719
00:34:32.850 --> 00:34:33.680
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what you should do.</v>

720
00:34:33.681 --> 00:34:36.920
<v Speaker 2>You should get one of those guns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get the same bullets.</v>

721
00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:38.120
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some ballistic dummies,</v>

722
00:34:38.121 --> 00:34:39.620
<v Speaker 2>which some bones inside and start </v>
<v Speaker 2>shooting.</v>

723
00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:40.840
<v Speaker 2>They've already done that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

724
00:34:40.850 --> 00:34:42.460
<v Speaker 2>The Penn and teller did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

725
00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:47.570
<v Speaker 2>Some people have done it and they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>found pretty close to what actually </v>

726
00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:47.570
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

727
00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:48.260
<v Speaker 2>they did within within the ground.</v>

728
00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:49.100
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

729
00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:54.150
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every bullet that hit bone got </v>

730
00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:54.150
<v Speaker 3>distorted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just what happens.</v>

731
00:34:54.150 --> 00:34:57.970
<v Speaker 3>The you shoot those bullets into water </v>
<v Speaker 3>or you shoot those bullets into like </v>

732
00:34:57.970 --> 00:35:02.321
<v Speaker 3>fluff or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't have a lot of impact to </v>

733
00:35:02.321 --> 00:35:04.040
<v Speaker 3>slow the bullet down or then you get a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bullet that looks like that.</v>

734
00:35:04.070 --> 00:35:07.700
<v Speaker 3>If you shoot a bullet into bone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they distort wildly where the bone was.</v>

735
00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:09.890
<v Speaker 3>The last thing that it hit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't matter.</v>

736
00:35:09.891 --> 00:35:11.870
<v Speaker 3>It's still hitting bone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he stopped at that point.</v>

737
00:35:12.110 --> 00:35:12.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean,</v>

738
00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:15.350
<v Speaker 3>didn't it hit bone and in Kennedy's body</v>
<v Speaker 3>as well?</v>

739
00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:17.350
<v Speaker 2>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Went through his neck.</v>

740
00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:24.040
<v Speaker 3>The odds of it hitting only soft tissue </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's going to go through his neck </v>

741
00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:27.911
<v Speaker 3>and it came out here that didn't clip </v>
<v Speaker 3>one of his vertebrae or something like </v>

742
00:35:27.911 --> 00:35:27.911
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think that's real.</v>

743
00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:30.650
<v Speaker 3>I think also there's a difference </v>
<v Speaker 3>between,</v>

744
00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:34.790
<v Speaker 3>and this is fact from David Lifton's </v>
<v Speaker 3>book best evidence,</v>

745
00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:38.560
<v Speaker 3>which was a book by a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an accountant to win over,</v>

746
00:35:38.561 --> 00:35:43.561
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Warren Commission report and fennel </v>

747
00:35:43.561 --> 00:35:45.410
<v Speaker 3>is factual inaccuracies and all these </v>
<v Speaker 3>contradictions.</v>

748
00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:50.160
<v Speaker 3>He found that there was a difference in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the autopsy report at Bethesda,</v>

749
00:35:50.161 --> 00:35:53.850
<v Speaker 3>Maryland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the to naval hospital versus the,</v>

750
00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:58.590
<v Speaker 3>the show what they had reported on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>scene in Dallas.</v>

751
00:35:58.950 --> 00:36:03.950
<v Speaker 3>The first doctors that got ahold of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kennedy's body in Dallas before they </v>

752
00:36:03.950 --> 00:36:07.581
<v Speaker 3>flew him to Bethesda,</v>
<v Speaker 3>said that the hole in his neck was an </v>

753
00:36:07.581 --> 00:36:09.870
<v Speaker 3>entry wound.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they got to Maryland,</v>

754
00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:12.600
<v Speaker 3>they changed that to a tracheotomy </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole.</v>

755
00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:17.600
<v Speaker 3>They changed the impact and they said </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it was a.</v>

756
00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:20.160
<v Speaker 3>They said that this was not an impact </v>
<v Speaker 3>from a bullet,</v>

757
00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:21.510
<v Speaker 3>that it was from something else.</v>

758
00:36:21.830 --> 00:36:24.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone said they enlarge the hole.</v>

759
00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:25.940
<v Speaker 2>Insert a trick tube.</v>

760
00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:27.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

761
00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:29.300
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

762
00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:29.770
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was,</v>

763
00:36:29.771 --> 00:36:34.771
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was also a lot of pressure on </v>

764
00:36:34.771 --> 00:36:35.950
<v Speaker 3>these people to try to wrap this up nice</v>
<v Speaker 3>and tight and say that Lee Harvey Oswald</v>

765
00:36:35.951 --> 00:36:36.550
<v Speaker 3>was the shooter.</v>

766
00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:37.410
<v Speaker 2>There was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

767
00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:38.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

768
00:36:38.251 --> 00:36:43.251
<v Speaker 2>There's this big thing about the CIA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the CIA inventing the FBI.</v>

769
00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:46.260
<v Speaker 2>The FBI will inventing the term </v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy theory.</v>

770
00:36:46.261 --> 00:36:47.930
<v Speaker 2>He was a CIA thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was A.</v>

771
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:51.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this was a couple of years after the</v>

772
00:36:51.751 --> 00:36:53.100
<v Speaker 2>assassination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

773
00:36:53.101 --> 00:36:54.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a memo that went out were they</v>

774
00:36:54.841 --> 00:36:57.540
<v Speaker 2>were concerned about all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy theories that were coming out</v>

775
00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:00.240
<v Speaker 2>and they used it to them conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 2>theories and then they,</v>

776
00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.500
<v Speaker 2>they said they should try to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

777
00:37:02.730 --> 00:37:06.330
<v Speaker 2>basically debunk them and make the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people who,</v>

778
00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:11.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spread them around look like a </v>

779
00:37:11.590 --> 00:37:15.740
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy theorist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But basically the theory is that the </v>

780
00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:17.550
<v Speaker 2>term conspiracy theory came from that </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular memo,</v>

781
00:37:18.210 --> 00:37:21.120
<v Speaker 2>that memo that never actually encouraged</v>
<v Speaker 2>people to use the term.</v>

782
00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:22.170
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

783
00:37:22.171 --> 00:37:27.171
<v Speaker 2>there was a huge concern from the CIA </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they would be,</v>

784
00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:30.210
<v Speaker 2>they would lose the trust of the public </v>
<v Speaker 2>if people,</v>

785
00:37:30.211 --> 00:37:32.760
<v Speaker 2>everybody started believing that it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>a conspiracy theory.</v>

786
00:37:33.330 --> 00:37:38.330
<v Speaker 2>At least that's what they said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe there is a conspiracy and </v>

787
00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:38.330
<v Speaker 2>maybe they are just trying to cover it </v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

788
00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:38.330
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

789
00:37:38.330 --> 00:37:42.780
<v Speaker 3>did you see the most recent dump of </v>
<v Speaker 3>information on the Kennedy assassination</v>

790
00:37:42.781 --> 00:37:47.781
<v Speaker 3>that Jack Ruby had stated to people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>before the day of the Kennedy </v>

791
00:37:47.781 --> 00:37:48.930
<v Speaker 3>assassination,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep an eye out today that's going to be</v>

792
00:37:48.931 --> 00:37:51.150
<v Speaker 3>fireworks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't say that.</v>

793
00:37:51.210 --> 00:37:56.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those Jack Ruby who eventually wound up </v>

794
00:37:56.210 --> 00:37:56.820
<v Speaker 3>shooting Lee Harvey Oswald in front of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the police officer.</v>

795
00:37:57.330 --> 00:37:58.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

796
00:37:58.771 --> 00:38:01.320
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his dad obviously.</v>

797
00:38:01.321 --> 00:38:06.321
<v Speaker 2>So you couldn't ask him what he actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>meant and things like that take on a </v>

798
00:38:06.321 --> 00:38:08.940
<v Speaker 2>special significance after an event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>

799
00:38:08.941 --> 00:38:10.510
<v Speaker 2>Whereas it could be just talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

800
00:38:10.511 --> 00:38:15.511
<v Speaker 2>like he was going to go visit his ex </v>
<v Speaker 2>wife or something or it was going to go </v>

801
00:38:15.511 --> 00:38:17.370
<v Speaker 2>to the bar or he was looking forward to </v>
<v Speaker 2>shouting at the parade or whatever.</v>

802
00:38:17.710 --> 00:38:19.720
<v Speaker 2>Could have been nothing but people say </v>
<v Speaker 2>things and you know,</v>

803
00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:24.860
<v Speaker 2>after something happens people go back </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they look at everything that </v>

804
00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:27.771
<v Speaker 2>happened and then they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that sounds like something </v>

805
00:38:27.771 --> 00:38:27.771
<v Speaker 2>significant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like with the Vegas shooting,</v>

806
00:38:27.771 --> 00:38:32.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a woman walking around the </v>

807
00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:33.640
<v Speaker 2>crowd in the Vegas shooting saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

808
00:38:33.690 --> 00:38:36.220
<v Speaker 2>you're all going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically what some people said,</v>

809
00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:40.000
<v Speaker 2>and this was like half an hour before </v>
<v Speaker 2>the actual shooting itself.</v>

810
00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:45.280
<v Speaker 2>So people take that event and then since</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people did die,</v>

811
00:38:45.910 --> 00:38:50.910
<v Speaker 2>they think that this woman actually knew</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was going to happen and she was </v>

812
00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:51.130
<v Speaker 2>trying to warn people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

813
00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:54.460
<v Speaker 2>But you also get crazy people wandering </v>
<v Speaker 2>around saying things all the time,</v>

814
00:38:54.490 --> 00:38:55.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in Vegas.</v>

815
00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:58.740
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the problem with you're all going to</v>

816
00:38:58.741 --> 00:39:01.050
<v Speaker 3>die is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a common one.</v>

817
00:39:01.051 --> 00:39:06.051
<v Speaker 3>Some guy was yelling that we took </v>
<v Speaker 3>pictures of them when we're in vegas </v>

818
00:39:06.051 --> 00:39:09.531
<v Speaker 3>long before the shooting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a few months ago we were </v>

819
00:39:09.531 --> 00:39:10.910
<v Speaker 3>standing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

820
00:39:10.911 --> 00:39:14.790
<v Speaker 3>we were in a car and he was standing on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the corner and he had a stack of signs.</v>

821
00:39:14.791 --> 00:39:18.330
<v Speaker 3>I put it up on my instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know I did because there was many,</v>

822
00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:21.840
<v Speaker 3>there was stacks of signs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had not just one sign.</v>

823
00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:27.010
<v Speaker 3>We had like a long totem pole of signs </v>
<v Speaker 3>with all these different things and I </v>

824
00:39:27.010 --> 00:39:27.870
<v Speaker 3>was taking photos of it and the guy was </v>
<v Speaker 3>yelling out,</v>

825
00:39:27.871 --> 00:39:32.871
<v Speaker 3>everyone's going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he was yelling it out that you </v>

826
00:39:32.871 --> 00:39:34.560
<v Speaker 3>know God's wrath and all this crazy </v>
<v Speaker 3>religious stuff.</v>

827
00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.420
<v Speaker 3>That's a common thing for crazy people </v>
<v Speaker 3>to shout.</v>

828
00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:37.770
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What they do show.</v>

829
00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:42.920
<v Speaker 3>It's not like this woman was saying </v>
<v Speaker 3>specifically someone is going to shoot </v>

830
00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:43.920
<v Speaker 3>everyone at this concert,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get out of here.</v>

831
00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:46.530
<v Speaker 3>This is a dangerous area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If she was trying to warn them,</v>

832
00:39:46.531 --> 00:39:48.090
<v Speaker 3>she would have been a bit more specific.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

833
00:39:48.091 --> 00:39:49.290
<v Speaker 3>very specific.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

834
00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:51.360
<v Speaker 3>If she knew something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you see?</v>

835
00:39:51.390 --> 00:39:52.620
<v Speaker 3>Do you find it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

836
00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:55.170
<v Speaker 3>I know I put it up there because we were</v>
<v Speaker 3>mocking it.</v>

837
00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:57.150
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I'll put it on my instagram story </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it went away.</v>

838
00:39:58.140 --> 00:39:59.760
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's,</v>

839
00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:02.460
<v Speaker 3>it's there from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to say,</v>

840
00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:04.920
<v Speaker 3>I want to say it was at least six months</v>
<v Speaker 3>ago,</v>

841
00:40:05.370 --> 00:40:08.760
<v Speaker 3>but we were mocking this guy because </v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy got a lot of fucking signs,</v>

842
00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:11.190
<v Speaker 3>like one signs on enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go is this is the guy,</v>

843
00:40:11.370 --> 00:40:13.650
<v Speaker 3>this is the reason why twitter only has </v>
<v Speaker 3>140 characters.</v>

844
00:40:13.830 --> 00:40:15.130
<v Speaker 3>Motherfuckers like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

845
00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:17.840
<v Speaker 3>I remember is like July because there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like 120 degrees out too,</v>

846
00:40:17.841 --> 00:40:18.600
<v Speaker 3>wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

847
00:40:18.601 --> 00:40:21.960
<v Speaker 3>It was a very hot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This goofy ass hole had this giant stack</v>

848
00:40:21.961 --> 00:40:23.610
<v Speaker 3>of science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

849
00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:26.280
<v Speaker 3>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the back to the Kennedy thing,</v>

850
00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:31.310
<v Speaker 3>what do you think happened?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that Lee Harvey Oswald </v>

851
00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:31.310
<v Speaker 3>probably acted alone?</v>

852
00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:34.990
<v Speaker 2>I think he probably acted alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the physics of what happened </v>

853
00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:37.370
<v Speaker 2>like is fairly consistent with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>single shooter theory.</v>

854
00:40:37.670 --> 00:40:41.900
<v Speaker 2>Now admittedly the magic bullet is a bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>strange,</v>

855
00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:46.130
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think it was after the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rounds of possibilities a</v>

856
00:40:46.750 --> 00:40:49.140
<v Speaker 3>do because of the fact the metal </v>
<v Speaker 3>particles.</v>

857
00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:52.380
<v Speaker 3>There's more bullet fragments in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Connolly's body.</v>

858
00:40:52.381 --> 00:40:54.900
<v Speaker 3>Then we're missing from that almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>pristine bullet.</v>

859
00:40:55.410 --> 00:40:58.740
<v Speaker 3>And even though the fact that it hit </v>
<v Speaker 3>connolly at the very end,</v>

860
00:40:59.350 --> 00:41:04.350
<v Speaker 3>if it went through all that flesh and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't hit any bone until it hit his </v>

861
00:41:04.801 --> 00:41:09.801
<v Speaker 3>wrist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it would not have been compromised </v>

862
00:41:09.801 --> 00:41:09.801
<v Speaker 3>very much ballistically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It would still be going incredibly fast.</v>

863
00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:11.460
<v Speaker 3>It still would have smashed into that </v>
<v Speaker 3>bone.</v>

864
00:41:11.461 --> 00:41:14.730
<v Speaker 3>It did enough to break his wrist and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>would have distorted the bullet.</v>

865
00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:16.080
<v Speaker 3>That's just what happens with bullets.</v>

866
00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.000
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately,</v>

867
00:41:17.001 --> 00:41:20.180
<v Speaker 2>I didn't really follow JFK conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 2>very much.</v>

868
00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:23.150
<v Speaker 2>And the reason I don't is that there are</v>
<v Speaker 2>already,</v>

869
00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:25.670
<v Speaker 2>like I think literally over a thousand</v>

870
00:41:26.130 --> 00:41:28.620
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] I've read.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've read a few,</v>

871
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:31.650
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got into case closed.</v>

872
00:41:32.010 --> 00:41:35.150
<v Speaker 3>That was a Vincent Bugliosi book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that who it was?</v>

873
00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:37.850
<v Speaker 3>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy's got an agenda.</v>

874
00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:38.810
<v Speaker 3>It just didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

875
00:41:39.370 --> 00:41:44.370
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's many books that you could read </v>

876
00:41:44.370 --> 00:41:47.360
<v Speaker 3>about the Kennedy assassination and some</v>
<v Speaker 3>of them favor the conspiracy and some of</v>

877
00:41:47.361 --> 00:41:52.361
<v Speaker 3>them favor the assassination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think they have a lot of them have </v>

878
00:41:52.361 --> 00:41:55.871
<v Speaker 3>merit on both sides.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One thing that drives me crazy when </v>

879
00:41:55.871 --> 00:41:56.360
<v Speaker 3>people say that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could never make that shot,</v>

880
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:59.120
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's bullshit.</v>

881
00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:02.930
<v Speaker 3>This is why I know it's bullshit because</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was only like a couple hundred yards,</v>

882
00:42:03.290 --> 00:42:06.150
<v Speaker 3>like a couple hundred yards shooting it </v>
<v Speaker 3>something the size.</v>

883
00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:11.180
<v Speaker 3>A person's head is easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about Jesse Ventura trying to do </v>

884
00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:12.470
<v Speaker 3>the a three,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three shots against shots.</v>

885
00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:14.360
<v Speaker 3>Stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't know what he's doing,</v>

886
00:42:14.930 --> 00:42:19.100
<v Speaker 3>but I mean first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would if you were used to that rifle</v>

887
00:42:19.101 --> 00:42:20.330
<v Speaker 3>and you practice that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone said,</v>

888
00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:21.470
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the scope was off.</v>

889
00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:26.800
<v Speaker 3>I think that's bullshit too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason why I think that's bullshit </v>

890
00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:26.800
<v Speaker 3>is because it's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Naca scope off.</v>

891
00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:31.510
<v Speaker 3>You have to have a direct chain of </v>
<v Speaker 3>evidence between the time Lee Harvey </v>

892
00:42:31.510 --> 00:42:32.690
<v Speaker 3>Oswald had that scope shooting that </v>
<v Speaker 3>rifle.</v>

893
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:37.870
<v Speaker 3>The moment he shot that rifle and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to hand it off to someone who </v>

894
00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:38.570
<v Speaker 3>checks the scope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

895
00:42:38.571 --> 00:42:42.020
<v Speaker 3>Then because if you drop a rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the scope goes off.</v>

896
00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:43.700
<v Speaker 3>Just drop it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done that before.</v>

897
00:42:43.790 --> 00:42:48.790
<v Speaker 3>I dropped a rifle once when I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting in Wisconsin and my scope was </v>

898
00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:50.510
<v Speaker 3>off by six inches at 100 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just dropping it.</v>

899
00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:53.810
<v Speaker 3>So the idea that he could have never </v>
<v Speaker 3>made that shot because the scope is off.</v>

900
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:58.990
<v Speaker 3>Scopes get adjusted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what happens when you drop a </v>

901
00:42:58.990 --> 00:42:58.990
<v Speaker 3>scope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they move.</v>

902
00:42:58.990 --> 00:43:01.490
<v Speaker 3>That's a whole thing about ballistics.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to check them.</v>

903
00:43:01.491 --> 00:43:04.490
<v Speaker 3>You go to the range,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you set up a a lead sled,</v>

904
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:07.400
<v Speaker 3>you lay the other rifle down so it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>perfectly stable.</v>

905
00:43:07.490 --> 00:43:10.280
<v Speaker 3>You squeeze off a shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you use the binoculars,</v>

906
00:43:10.281 --> 00:43:12.290
<v Speaker 3>you find out where the the shot hit on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the target,</v>

907
00:43:12.291 --> 00:43:14.480
<v Speaker 3>and then you adjust the scope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're adjustable.</v>

908
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:17.240
<v Speaker 3>So the idea that his scope was no good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy.</v>

909
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:20.210
<v Speaker 3>The idea that that shot was too far to </v>
<v Speaker 3>make insane.</v>

910
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:22.640
<v Speaker 3>It was only,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was less than a hundred yards</v>

911
00:43:22.641 --> 00:43:25.130
<v Speaker 3>when they think he made the first shot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a chip shot.</v>

912
00:43:25.370 --> 00:43:27.410
<v Speaker 3>That's the shot that you would make </v>
<v Speaker 3>without even arrest.</v>

913
00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:30.170
<v Speaker 3>Now he's making this shot resting on the</v>
<v Speaker 3>window,</v>

914
00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:35.260
<v Speaker 3>so he's perfectly steady.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that that was impossible as </v>

915
00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:38.621
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that no one can do that in </v>

916
00:43:38.621 --> 00:43:38.621
<v Speaker 3>three shots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's been disproven.</v>

917
00:43:38.621 --> 00:43:43.360
<v Speaker 3>Someone can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone who's really good at reloading </v>

918
00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:44.420
<v Speaker 3>and loading can do it just because Jesse</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ventura couldn't do it,</v>

919
00:43:44.690 --> 00:43:49.690
<v Speaker 3>but Jesse super conspiracy mind is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes all in with the conspiracy </v>

920
00:43:49.881 --> 00:43:53.660
<v Speaker 3>theorist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the motivated reasoning part of doing it</v>

921
00:43:53.850 --> 00:43:55.880
<v Speaker 3>just for a show or because he really </v>
<v Speaker 3>believes it.</v>

922
00:43:56.150 --> 00:43:58.400
<v Speaker 3>I worked with the same people that did </v>
<v Speaker 3>his show,</v>

923
00:43:58.430 --> 00:44:03.430
<v Speaker 3>the same people that did his show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reason why I did Joe Rogan </v>

924
00:44:03.430 --> 00:44:06.731
<v Speaker 3>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everything is they wanted me to take </v>

925
00:44:06.731 --> 00:44:06.830
<v Speaker 3>over Jesse show after it was done and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>was uninterested.</v>

926
00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:08.180
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going.</v>

927
00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:10.400
<v Speaker 3>I'm not that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not like the.</v>

928
00:44:10.401 --> 00:44:12.410
<v Speaker 3>I believe every conspiracy guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

929
00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:17.440
<v Speaker 3>I think there's people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think people have a real weird vested </v>

930
00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:19.550
<v Speaker 3>interest in proving that things are </v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy.</v>

931
00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:23.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm interested in finding out what </v>
<v Speaker 3>things really are like legitimately what</v>

932
00:44:23.571 --> 00:44:24.560
<v Speaker 3>they really are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

933
00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:26.080
<v Speaker 3>and even if I'm wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I'm.</v>

934
00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:31.120
<v Speaker 3>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not interested in reinforcing </v>

935
00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:34.961
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've already said if I find out that </v>

936
00:44:34.961 --> 00:44:37.851
<v Speaker 3>what I said was wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm interested in repeating that I was </v>

937
00:44:37.851 --> 00:44:38.680
<v Speaker 3>wrong as many times as they can to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>it out to as many people as I can.</v>

938
00:44:38.681 --> 00:44:43.681
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm with you because I think it's </v>

939
00:44:43.681 --> 00:44:43.681
<v Speaker 3>important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this,</v>

940
00:44:43.681 --> 00:44:44.070
<v Speaker 3>this JFK thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's bullshit on both sides of it,</v>

941
00:44:44.310 --> 00:44:47.070
<v Speaker 3>but the idea that this guy who went over</v>
<v Speaker 3>to Russia,</v>

942
00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:49.350
<v Speaker 3>married a Russian citizen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>came back here,</v>

943
00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:53.160
<v Speaker 3>was it mean he was absolutely involved </v>
<v Speaker 3>in some shady,</v>

944
00:44:53.161 --> 00:44:56.320
<v Speaker 3>weird shit with Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a fucking weird guy.</v>

945
00:44:56.680 --> 00:45:01.680
<v Speaker 3>Harvey Oswald was a weird guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that he was completely </v>

946
00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:01.680
<v Speaker 3>innocent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not buying that either.</v>

947
00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:06.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the idea that it's proven that he </v>

948
00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:11.000
<v Speaker 2>acted entirely alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's entirely possible that the other </v>

949
00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.791
<v Speaker 2>people who were helping him or </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivating him or giving him an </v>

950
00:45:13.791 --> 00:45:14.420
<v Speaker 2>instructions even.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

951
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:18.750
<v Speaker 2>The thing I don't think has really </v>
<v Speaker 2>proven is the additional shooter theory.</v>

952
00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:23.960
<v Speaker 3>It's not proven and there have been </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that said they heard things from </v>

953
00:45:23.960 --> 00:45:24.810
<v Speaker 3>behind them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem with that is chaos.</v>

954
00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:27.330
<v Speaker 3>When you have gun shots,</v>
<v Speaker 3>first of all,</v>

955
00:45:27.331 --> 00:45:30.600
<v Speaker 3>gunshots in an area where dealey plaza,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the echos,</v>

956
00:45:31.050 --> 00:45:36.050
<v Speaker 3>echos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ring out and people claim to see things </v>

957
00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:36.270
<v Speaker 3>and hear things they even believed </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>

958
00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:41.040
<v Speaker 3>Have you tell someone that you heard </v>
<v Speaker 3>something in the bushes and then you run</v>

959
00:45:41.041 --> 00:45:42.480
<v Speaker 3>away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That person will say,</v>

960
00:45:42.660 --> 00:45:45.690
<v Speaker 3>I heard something in the bushes and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>other people were repeated.</v>

961
00:45:45.691 --> 00:45:48.920
<v Speaker 3>It becomes the narrative and it just </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets real hard.</v>

962
00:45:48.930 --> 00:45:51.150
<v Speaker 3>Create memories for you can you can.</v>

963
00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:52.920
<v Speaker 2>You're going to point to somebody and </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

964
00:45:52.921 --> 00:45:57.921
<v Speaker 2>there is somebody there and they'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that was somebody that I liked it </v>

965
00:45:57.921 --> 00:45:57.921
<v Speaker 2>because they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

966
00:45:57.921 --> 00:46:00.900
<v Speaker 2>the brain is so chaotically working form</v>
<v Speaker 2>was memories in a very weird.</v>

967
00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:05.130
<v Speaker 3>Especially when it comes to something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's so significant like the president</v>

968
00:46:05.131 --> 00:46:10.131
<v Speaker 3>getting shot or any sort of violent </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing of this is something that gets </v>

969
00:46:10.131 --> 00:46:14.031
<v Speaker 3>repeated ad nauseum about nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's something that people point to </v>

970
00:46:14.031 --> 00:46:17.661
<v Speaker 3>where they think that when the planes </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit those buildings that there was </v>

971
00:46:17.661 --> 00:46:19.770
<v Speaker 3>detonations that caused tower one tower </v>
<v Speaker 3>two to fall.</v>

972
00:46:19.771 --> 00:46:21.480
<v Speaker 3>There's no way they would've fallen like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

973
00:46:21.990 --> 00:46:25.320
<v Speaker 3>Like when people say no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they heard things in the buildings,</v>

974
00:46:25.321 --> 00:46:28.920
<v Speaker 3>they heard explosions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People always say shit like that.</v>

975
00:46:28.921 --> 00:46:33.921
<v Speaker 3>And on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're dealing with a building </v>

976
00:46:33.921 --> 00:46:34.620
<v Speaker 3>collapsing like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna hear a lot of crazy shit.</v>

977
00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:35.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

978
00:46:35.770 --> 00:46:37.910
<v Speaker 2>You gotta that all going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>explosions,</v>

979
00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:39.050
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things are falling.</v>

980
00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:44.160
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were people falling off the </v>

981
00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:44.160
<v Speaker 2>buildings which goes to to</v>

982
00:46:44.160 --> 00:46:47.780
<v Speaker 3>tower seven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another one that keeps coming up </v>

983
00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:48.350
<v Speaker 3>the see if you can find the video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jamie,</v>

984
00:46:48.351 --> 00:46:52.010
<v Speaker 3>there's a video that shows what really </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened in tower seven.</v>

985
00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:56.990
<v Speaker 3>There's a guy who was a conspiracy guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was really deep into conspiracies and</v>

986
00:46:56.991 --> 00:46:59.510
<v Speaker 3>then the more he started looking into </v>
<v Speaker 3>tower seven,</v>

987
00:46:59.810 --> 00:47:04.810
<v Speaker 3>the more he realized that everyone is </v>
<v Speaker 3>just showing the very final video where </v>

988
00:47:04.810 --> 00:47:09.641
<v Speaker 3>tower seven collapses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a controlled demolition and it </v>

989
00:47:09.641 --> 00:47:09.980
<v Speaker 3>looks exactly like a controlled </v>
<v Speaker 3>demolition.</v>

990
00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:13.010
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you find the full video,</v>

991
00:47:13.011 --> 00:47:17.510
<v Speaker 3>you see that the interior had collapsed </v>
<v Speaker 3>moments before,</v>

992
00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:21.200
<v Speaker 3>like quite a bit before Edward Current.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the video,</v>

993
00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:26.230
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly who it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See if you can find that gentleman's </v>

994
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:27.590
<v Speaker 3>video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he shows how the top of it,</v>

995
00:47:27.591 --> 00:47:32.591
<v Speaker 3>you could see the of tower seven given </v>
<v Speaker 3>which is consistent with this idea that </v>

996
00:47:33.851 --> 00:47:37.750
<v Speaker 3>the diesel fuel that they had in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>basement had created,</v>

997
00:47:37.810 --> 00:47:39.040
<v Speaker 3>wasn't a diesel tank.</v>

998
00:47:39.250 --> 00:47:44.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was an early theory at the diesel </v>

999
00:47:44.250 --> 00:47:44.250
<v Speaker 2>fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1000
00:47:44.250 --> 00:47:44.250
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was actually fueling the fire.</v>

1001
00:47:44.250 --> 00:47:47.830
<v Speaker 2>But they never found any evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually the diesel fuel contribution to</v>

1002
00:47:47.831 --> 00:47:51.670
<v Speaker 2>the fires,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just a regular office buyers,</v>

1003
00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:53.740
<v Speaker 2>which is what everybody finds those </v>
<v Speaker 2>associates.</v>

1004
00:47:54.010 --> 00:47:58.780
<v Speaker 3>Diesel never caught fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They might've been after the collapse.</v>

1005
00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:04.020
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're recovered one of the </v>

1006
00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:04.020
<v Speaker 2>tanks with some days I'll still in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1007
00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:08.180
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>series of diesel likely fed by a series </v>

1008
00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:08.620
<v Speaker 3>of diesel generators located in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>lower floors,</v>

1009
00:48:08.621 --> 00:48:10.660
<v Speaker 3>which is where most of the fires were </v>
<v Speaker 3>concentrated.</v>

1010
00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:15.730
<v Speaker 3>So at least one of the diesel tower,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a diesel tanks didn't light up.</v>

1011
00:48:15.731 --> 00:48:17.190
<v Speaker 3>Is that what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

1012
00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:23.020
<v Speaker 3>the theory,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this theory is that the diesel had </v>

1013
00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:23.020
<v Speaker 3>nothing to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1014
00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:23.950
<v Speaker 3>So nist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

1015
00:48:23.951 --> 00:48:26.620
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you are a conspiracy theory person,</v>

1016
00:48:26.621 --> 00:48:29.710
<v Speaker 3>they get really angry when you bring up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that the government,</v>

1017
00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:31.600
<v Speaker 3>the government man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1018
00:48:31.601 --> 00:48:33.790
<v Speaker 3>so I think this is an older video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1019
00:48:33.791 --> 00:48:35.180
<v Speaker 3>This isn't the video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jim.</v>

1020
00:48:35.230 --> 00:48:37.650
<v Speaker 3>There's one by Edwidge current.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1021
00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:43.500
<v Speaker 3>And what it does is it shows the top of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the building cave in first quite a bit </v>

1022
00:48:44.381 --> 00:48:49.381
<v Speaker 3>before the rest of the building.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this idea that it all cave in like a </v>

1023
00:48:49.381 --> 00:48:52.540
<v Speaker 3>controlled demolition because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>detonated all those things.</v>

1024
00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:56.160
<v Speaker 3>So Do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>

1025
00:48:56.161 --> 00:48:56.610
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>

1026
00:48:56.611 --> 00:48:58.260
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that Edward Current?</v>

1027
00:48:58.850 --> 00:49:00.810
<v Speaker 3>I've got to find a good spot of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>video to show it.</v>

1028
00:49:00.811 --> 00:49:01.840
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1029
00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:04.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what happened,</v>

1030
00:49:04.110 --> 00:49:09.110
<v Speaker 3>what they think was that the fire,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is shitty design of a building and </v>

1031
00:49:09.110 --> 00:49:13.520
<v Speaker 3>the fire caused internal damage to all </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the floors.</v>

1032
00:49:13.550 --> 00:49:14.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see that,</v>

1033
00:49:14.231 --> 00:49:19.231
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the World Trade Center fell basically </v>

1034
00:49:19.231 --> 00:49:19.760
<v Speaker 2>against the side of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of seven.</v>

1035
00:49:19.820 --> 00:49:22.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was back of the building was all kind</v>

1036
00:49:22.191 --> 00:49:25.040
<v Speaker 2>of like all the windows were broken on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the backside.</v>

1037
00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:28.760
<v Speaker 2>There was one column in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the back that was missing in a big chunk</v>

1038
00:49:28.940 --> 00:49:29.760
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1039
00:49:29.810 --> 00:49:32.990
<v Speaker 2>lower west side was going to gouge it </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1040
00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:35.960
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this idea that it was just a fire.</v>

1041
00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:37.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't justified.</v>

1042
00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:42.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fire is what triggered the collapse </v>

1043
00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:45.370
<v Speaker 2>eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the fact that all the windows were </v>

1044
00:49:45.370 --> 00:49:47.651
<v Speaker 2>missing from the south side contributed </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot to that because you've got a lot </v>

1045
00:49:47.651 --> 00:49:47.720
<v Speaker 2>of wind flow through.</v>

1046
00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:52.060
<v Speaker 3>See if he's got the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Dunno mate,</v>

1047
00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:55.860
<v Speaker 3>maybe this is a bad thing to do while </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're actually doing the show.</v>

1048
00:49:55.861 --> 00:50:00.861
<v Speaker 3>So this is what the idea is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Nis computer models that all these </v>

1049
00:50:00.861 --> 00:50:02.960
<v Speaker 3>floors had collapsed inside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Outside collapsed too.</v>

1050
00:50:03.410 --> 00:50:05.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what this guy,</v>

1051
00:50:05.610 --> 00:50:08.790
<v Speaker 3>Edward current had showed in his video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was him,</v>

1052
00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.610
<v Speaker 3>was he showed that the top part that </v>
<v Speaker 3>past.</v>

1053
00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:13.860
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the top penthouse had collapsed first.</v>

1054
00:50:13.861 --> 00:50:15.120
<v Speaker 3>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>CVC,</v>

1055
00:50:15.121 --> 00:50:17.530
<v Speaker 3>the pen house collapsing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See is sinking it up.</v>

1056
00:50:17.531 --> 00:50:19.290
<v Speaker 3>But with the two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the two videos,</v>

1057
00:50:19.291 --> 00:50:22.110
<v Speaker 3>the simulation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's sitting up there and then boom,</v>

1058
00:50:22.111 --> 00:50:25.560
<v Speaker 3>you see it collapsed and so the windows </v>
<v Speaker 3>breaking down.</v>

1059
00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:27.350
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's that.</v>

1060
00:50:27.351 --> 00:50:28.370
<v Speaker 3>No one ever shows</v>

1061
00:50:28.370 --> 00:50:30.370
<v Speaker 1>and then it gives in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1062
00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:34.820
<v Speaker 1>so this is not a quick thing like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>controlled demolition.</v>

1063
00:50:34.821 --> 00:50:39.821
<v Speaker 1>All those windows giving in is </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicative of all those floors </v>

1064
00:50:39.821 --> 00:50:42.170
<v Speaker 1>collapsing probably more than it is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of the,</v>

1065
00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:44.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that want to see conspiracy,</v>

1066
00:50:44.871 --> 00:50:49.871
<v Speaker 1>think that those bombs were going off </v>
<v Speaker 1>there and that as those definitions or </v>

1067
00:50:49.871 --> 00:50:53.700
<v Speaker 1>explosions were going off that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what caused all those floors to collapse</v>

1068
00:50:53.701 --> 00:50:58.701
<v Speaker 1>on top of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's what's talking about </v>

1069
00:50:58.701 --> 00:50:59.120
<v Speaker 1>what the core beliefs of the conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 1>theories with nine slash 11.</v>

1070
00:50:59.121 --> 00:50:59.840
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this back,</v>

1071
00:50:59.841 --> 00:51:04.040
<v Speaker 1>that world trade center seven looks like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a controlled demolition is core belief,</v>

1072
00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:07.880
<v Speaker 1>but when you actually get into something</v>
<v Speaker 1>and describe what's actually happening,</v>

1073
00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:13.180
<v Speaker 1>you have to go through a much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated conspiracy theory at a much </v>

1074
00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:16.721
<v Speaker 1>more complicated way of looking at what </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually happened and now they're trying</v>

1075
00:51:17.241 --> 00:51:22.241
<v Speaker 1>to do a complicated study of World Trade</v>
<v Speaker 1>Center seven at the University of </v>

1076
00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:22.760
<v Speaker 1>Alaska.</v>

1077
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:27.790
<v Speaker 1>This is something paid for by architects</v>
<v Speaker 1>and engineers when nine slash 11 truth </v>

1078
00:51:27.790 --> 00:51:31.090
<v Speaker 1>that trying to actually figure out how </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can reconcile controlled demolition</v>

1079
00:51:31.341 --> 00:51:33.500
<v Speaker 1>with the fact that it collapsed the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>it did,</v>

1080
00:51:34.380 --> 00:51:39.380
<v Speaker 1>so they're trying to actually explain </v>
<v Speaker 1>something which doesn't really need to </v>

1081
00:51:39.380 --> 00:51:40.220
<v Speaker 1>explain to him because the explanation </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been done by nist already.</v>

1082
00:51:40.310 --> 00:51:45.310
<v Speaker 1>So what they're trying to do is find </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that reinforces their initial </v>

1083
00:51:45.310 --> 00:51:49.100
<v Speaker 1>idea instead of it just look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>facts itself saying,</v>

1084
00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:54.130
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at the top of the penthouse </v>

1085
00:51:54.130 --> 00:51:56.140
<v Speaker 1>collapsing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not indicative of a controlled </v>

1086
00:51:56.140 --> 00:51:58.361
<v Speaker 1>demolition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's indicative of the model that Nis </v>

1087
00:51:58.361 --> 00:51:58.370
<v Speaker 1>described,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a slow burn inside.</v>

1088
00:51:58.580 --> 00:52:02.180
<v Speaker 1>Extremely hot deterioration of all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>internal structure.</v>

1089
00:52:02.181 --> 00:52:05.250
<v Speaker 1>Everything starts to collapse inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the outside Clabsi to.</v>

1090
00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:10.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them will say that that is </v>

1091
00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:10.420
<v Speaker 1>actually how controlled demolitions are </v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

1092
00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:13.781
<v Speaker 1>You blow up the interior of the building</v>
<v Speaker 1>first and then you blow the exterior of </v>

1093
00:52:13.781 --> 00:52:13.781
<v Speaker 1>the building.</v>

1094
00:52:13.781 --> 00:52:18.250
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the problem is that none of the </v>

1095
00:52:18.250 --> 00:52:20.111
<v Speaker 1>exterior columns were cut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was no explosion scene on the </v>

1096
00:52:20.111 --> 00:52:22.010
<v Speaker 1>exterior columns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at the World Trade Center,</v>

1097
00:52:22.011 --> 00:52:23.640
<v Speaker 1>one or two coming down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1098
00:52:23.650 --> 00:52:28.650
<v Speaker 1>you can kind of imagine their explosions</v>
<v Speaker 1>going all the way down because of those </v>

1099
00:52:28.650 --> 00:52:28.730
<v Speaker 1>things that looked like explosions from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the folding floors,</v>

1100
00:52:28.970 --> 00:52:31.790
<v Speaker 1>but in seven you just see the building </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of just going to crumble down.</v>

1101
00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:37.360
<v Speaker 1>So they have to kind of explain that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they come up with this study that </v>

1102
00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:37.360
<v Speaker 1>they funded.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's custom,</v>

1103
00:52:37.550 --> 00:52:40.230
<v Speaker 1>nearly $400,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1104
00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:45.230
<v Speaker 1>and they're trying to come up with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation that doesn't involve fire a,</v>

1105
00:52:45.231 --> 00:52:48.890
<v Speaker 1>so that saying like if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it was controlled demolition than the</v>

1106
00:52:48.891 --> 00:52:53.400
<v Speaker 1>way they would have done it is blowing </v>
<v Speaker 1>up these interior columns a and it would</v>

1107
00:52:53.401 --> 00:52:57.050
<v Speaker 1>have pulled in the exterior and </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapsed the way we see in the video.</v>

1108
00:52:57.320 --> 00:53:02.320
<v Speaker 1>And I think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them say that the penthouse </v>

1109
00:53:02.320 --> 00:53:03.620
<v Speaker 1>thing was a separate thing because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to have a neat demolition.</v>

1110
00:53:03.621 --> 00:53:06.750
<v Speaker 1>So they first of all blew up a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>floors just underneath the penthouse.</v>

1111
00:53:06.751 --> 00:53:10.640
<v Speaker 1>So neagley collapsed inside the building</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they blew up some floors at the</v>

1112
00:53:10.641 --> 00:53:15.641
<v Speaker 1>bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's all fell in itself without </v>

1113
00:53:15.641 --> 00:53:18.191
<v Speaker 1>damaging the surrounding buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they've got this complex theory and </v>

1114
00:53:18.191 --> 00:53:22.031
<v Speaker 1>it's based on confirmation bias.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's based on confirming this idea that </v>

1115
00:53:22.031 --> 00:53:25.541
<v Speaker 1>this is a controlled demolition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not on examining the whole thing as it </v>

1116
00:53:25.541 --> 00:53:25.800
<v Speaker 1>and going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1117
00:53:26.070 --> 00:53:29.130
<v Speaker 3>is it possible that the model is correct</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that these.</v>

1118
00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:34.400
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the thing that I bring up to people all </v>

1119
00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:34.400
<v Speaker 3>the time when they want to talk about </v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracies,</v>

1120
00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:37.380
<v Speaker 3>there is a real conspiracy nine slash 11</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's the fact that it happened.</v>

1121
00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:40.140
<v Speaker 3>The fact that they did fly planes into </v>
<v Speaker 3>buildings,</v>

1122
00:53:40.141 --> 00:53:42.030
<v Speaker 3>that's a conspiracy and they pulled it </v>
<v Speaker 3>off.</v>

1123
00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:47.010
<v Speaker 3>That actually did happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People don't want that to be it.</v>

1124
00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:52.040
<v Speaker 3>They want it to be a much broader </v>
<v Speaker 3>conspiracy involving world governments </v>

1125
00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:54.180
<v Speaker 3>that are trying to close in on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1126
00:53:54.181 --> 00:53:56.850
<v Speaker 3>all our rights and this is the way to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1127
00:53:56.851 --> 00:53:57.020
<v Speaker 3>And</v>

1128
00:53:57.420 --> 00:53:58.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his proportionality,</v>

1129
00:53:58.770 --> 00:54:02.810
<v Speaker 2>people want something to be in </v>
<v Speaker 2>proportion to the size of the event when</v>

1130
00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:07.820
<v Speaker 2>they think just like a bunch of Arabs </v>
<v Speaker 2>with knives isn't a big enough cause.</v>

1131
00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:11.550
<v Speaker 2>So they think that it has to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1132
00:54:11.610 --> 00:54:14.130
<v Speaker 2>We have more significant end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even like with the physics of it,</v>

1133
00:54:14.131 --> 00:54:17.490
<v Speaker 2>they think he have the plane flew into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the building and it didn't collapse.</v>

1134
00:54:17.491 --> 00:54:19.860
<v Speaker 2>So why would it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would it collapse?</v>

1135
00:54:19.861 --> 00:54:21.210
<v Speaker 2>Some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people don't think that,</v>

1136
00:54:21.211 --> 00:54:24.350
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the plane we even have in the hall,</v>

1137
00:54:24.570 --> 00:54:28.350
<v Speaker 2>they think it would have been bounced </v>
<v Speaker 2>off or who the fluxing said,</v>

1138
00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:29.540
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them think that the,</v>

1139
00:54:29.830 --> 00:54:32.460
<v Speaker 2>the tower would have knocked over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1140
00:54:32.490 --> 00:54:37.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But these are people who have really no </v>

1141
00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:39.801
<v Speaker 2>conception whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a physics and there's a minority of </v>

1142
00:54:39.801 --> 00:54:39.801
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you'll find people who,</v>

1143
00:54:39.801 --> 00:54:43.380
<v Speaker 2>who don't understand how aluminum can </v>
<v Speaker 2>cut through steel,</v>

1144
00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:46.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the columns of the exterior of the World</v>

1145
00:54:46.530 --> 00:54:50.430
<v Speaker 2>Trade Center were made of steel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very strong steel and planes are made of</v>

1146
00:54:50.431 --> 00:54:51.480
<v Speaker 2>mostly aluminum.</v>

1147
00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:55.380
<v Speaker 2>So they don't understand how a plane </v>
<v Speaker 2>made of aluminum,</v>

1148
00:54:55.381 --> 00:54:57.060
<v Speaker 2>which is soft,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can go through steel,</v>

1149
00:54:57.061 --> 00:55:01.410
<v Speaker 2>which is very hard and strong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the example I always give to them is</v>

1150
00:55:01.470 --> 00:55:04.740
<v Speaker 2>the ping pong ball going through a ping </v>
<v Speaker 2>pong paddle.</v>

1151
00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:08.340
<v Speaker 2>If you make it go fast enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is something I think mythbusters do</v>

1152
00:55:08.341 --> 00:55:10.200
<v Speaker 2>and various other people have done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1153
00:55:10.210 --> 00:55:15.210
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you send a regular ping pong ball a 500 </v>

1154
00:55:15.210 --> 00:55:17.040
<v Speaker 2>miles an hour into a ping pong paddle </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it just goes straight through.</v>

1155
00:55:17.041 --> 00:55:22.041
<v Speaker 2>It leaves a ping pong ball hole in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>middle of it and that's just what </v>

1156
00:55:22.041 --> 00:55:23.640
<v Speaker 2>happened on nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The planes were going 500 miles an hour.</v>

1157
00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:25.320
<v Speaker 2>So you could do that with a ping pong </v>
<v Speaker 2>ball.</v>

1158
00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:25.720
<v Speaker 2>You can.</v>

1159
00:55:26.110 --> 00:55:27.220
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that makes sense.</v>

1160
00:55:27.221 --> 00:55:28.410
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1161
00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:33.600
<v Speaker 3>for the planes to the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the amount of mass you're dealing with </v>

1162
00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:34.570
<v Speaker 3>two in the speed from 500 miles an hour.</v>

1163
00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:36.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you don't need to be,</v>

1164
00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:39.420
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't even need to be relatively </v>
<v Speaker 2>that much mass.</v>

1165
00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:44.800
<v Speaker 2>A ping pong ball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it weighs one gram and a paddle weighs </v>

1166
00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:45.460
<v Speaker 2>like 200 grams or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

1167
00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:50.910
<v Speaker 2>And you wouldn't think you've seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've seen ping pong paddles that is </v>

1168
00:55:50.910 --> 00:55:54.890
<v Speaker 2>laminated wood and rubber and you've got</v>
<v Speaker 2>this flimsy little bowl is how on earth </v>

1169
00:55:54.890 --> 00:55:56.190
<v Speaker 2>is that going to go through?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That switch is unintuitive,</v>

1170
00:55:56.450 --> 00:56:01.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can understand how people would </v>

1171
00:56:01.450 --> 00:56:03.560
<v Speaker 2>be confused about why the planes left </v>
<v Speaker 2>these little road runner</v>

1172
00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:06.640
<v Speaker 3>civic and find that you had the </v>
<v Speaker 3>mythbusters thing.</v>

1173
00:56:06.930 --> 00:56:08.710
<v Speaker 3>I want to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hear it is.</v>

1174
00:56:08.711 --> 00:56:09.790
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a whole.</v>

1175
00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:13.300
<v Speaker 3>So they have some crazy air cannon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

1176
00:56:13.390 --> 00:56:14.680
<v Speaker 3>Blows off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1177
00:56:14.710 --> 00:56:16.990
<v Speaker 3>Here's the problem with that though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's the problem with that.</v>

1178
00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:18.680
<v Speaker 3>They're doing that right in front.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

1179
00:56:18.740 --> 00:56:21.740
<v Speaker 2>have that they have to do with the pink </v>
<v Speaker 2>phone bulk because it will slow down,</v>

1180
00:56:21.741 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 2>but I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you're also with the</v>

1181
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:25.520
<v Speaker 1>actual air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1182
00:56:25.550 --> 00:56:26.360
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the.</v>

1183
00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:29.530
<v Speaker 1>But it is the ping pong table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can see it in slow motion.</v>

1184
00:56:29.531 --> 00:56:32.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because what I was going to bring up was</v>

1185
00:56:32.410 --> 00:56:37.410
<v Speaker 1>a guy killed himself once accidentally </v>
<v Speaker 1>on a movie set because he took an </v>

1186
00:56:37.511 --> 00:56:42.250
<v Speaker 1>unloaded gun and he shot it into his </v>
<v Speaker 1>temple and it blew his brains out.</v>

1187
00:56:42.310 --> 00:56:43.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was blank,</v>

1188
00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:48.610
<v Speaker 1>but the fact that it was a blank didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>stop that air from blowing through.</v>

1189
00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:54.270
<v Speaker 1>There is a thing that people do when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they hunt in Alaska and in an incredibly</v>

1190
00:56:55.691 --> 00:56:58.960
<v Speaker 1>moist climates and places where there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of dirt and debris,</v>

1191
00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:04.260
<v Speaker 1>they will put tape over the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rifle over the end of the barrel where </v>

1192
00:57:04.661 --> 00:57:09.661
<v Speaker 1>the bullet comes over or they even use a</v>
<v Speaker 1>condom and it has no effect whatsoever </v>

1193
00:57:10.031 --> 00:57:15.031
<v Speaker 1>on the accuracy of the bullet because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the air coming out of the rifle barrel </v>

1194
00:57:15.041 --> 00:57:18.770
<v Speaker 1>from the explosion blows that tape out </v>
<v Speaker 1>before the bill.</v>

1195
00:57:18.770 --> 00:57:19.970
<v Speaker 1>It even gets to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1196
00:57:20.570 --> 00:57:21.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1197
00:57:21.330 --> 00:57:24.670
<v Speaker 1>the only reason they have to have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing right at the end of the barrel,</v>

1198
00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:25.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the painful bowl,</v>

1199
00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:31.000
<v Speaker 1>but slow down in the say satellites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you felt something a little bit </v>

1200
00:57:31.901 --> 00:57:34.390
<v Speaker 1>heavier but still pretty small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will go through it.</v>

1201
00:57:34.510 --> 00:57:34.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1202
00:57:34.961 --> 00:57:39.961
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you think you've got to scale it up </v>

1203
00:57:39.961 --> 00:57:39.961
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1204
00:57:39.961 --> 00:57:39.961
<v Speaker 1>imagine like a beer barrel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1205
00:57:39.970 --> 00:57:44.110
<v Speaker 1>made a steel or aluminum weighs like 100</v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds or whatever.</v>

1206
00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:49.140
<v Speaker 1>What is full?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he imagined that slamming into </v>

1207
00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:51.871
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I have a ping pong ball can do </v>

1208
00:57:51.871 --> 00:57:51.871
<v Speaker 1>something at 500 miles an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1209
00:57:51.871 --> 00:57:53.610
<v Speaker 1>be a barrel at five miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't do it.</v>

1210
00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:55.870
<v Speaker 1>An awful amount of damage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably go right through a building.</v>

1211
00:57:55.930 --> 00:58:00.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then you scale up from like a beer </v>

1212
00:58:00.930 --> 00:58:01.000
<v Speaker 1>barrel to a 200 ton plane.</v>

1213
00:58:01.060 --> 00:58:06.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And 200 tons hitting something at 500 </v>

1214
00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:07.060
<v Speaker 1>miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter that it's,</v>

1215
00:58:07.090 --> 00:58:08.260
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's made out of aluminum.</v>

1216
00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:13.440
<v Speaker 1>It's still 200 tons of something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it was just a big bag of water </v>

1217
00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:17.581
<v Speaker 1>hitting something at 500 miles an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would still make a hole in the side </v>

1218
00:58:17.581 --> 00:58:21.031
<v Speaker 1>of the building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is a problem with a lot of </v>

1219
00:58:21.031 --> 00:58:23.551
<v Speaker 1>these theories is that a lot of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are involved in these </v>

1220
00:58:23.551 --> 00:58:26.341
<v Speaker 1>theories are either not educated in what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're talking about because there are </v>

1221
00:58:26.341 --> 00:58:30.601
<v Speaker 1>some various nuances to things like this</v>
<v Speaker 1>ping pong ball trick or they don't.</v>

1222
00:58:32.650 --> 00:58:37.650
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to look at anything that</v>

1223
00:58:38.111 --> 00:58:42.070
<v Speaker 1>takes away from this conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't want to look at anything that</v>

1224
00:58:42.071 --> 00:58:47.071
<v Speaker 1>debunks or disproves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just want confirmation of their </v>

1225
00:58:47.071 --> 00:58:50.371
<v Speaker 1>initial idea that this is some big grand</v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy that someone is in on it and </v>

1226
00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:53.620
<v Speaker 1>it's happening right before our eyes.</v>

1227
00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:54.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1228
00:58:54.660 --> 00:58:59.350
<v Speaker 1>It's quite hard to even get one point </v>
<v Speaker 1>past a lot of people.</v>

1229
00:59:00.100 --> 00:59:02.700
<v Speaker 1>If someone starts out with that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that theory,</v>

1230
00:59:02.710 --> 00:59:07.710
<v Speaker 1>that aluminum cannot cut steel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that just becomes the gatekeeping </v>

1231
00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:12.550
<v Speaker 1>obstacle that you have to get past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can't disprove that one thing,</v>

1232
00:59:12.551 --> 00:59:17.551
<v Speaker 1>it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing else matters really for them </v>

1233
00:59:17.551 --> 00:59:17.551
<v Speaker 1>because the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1234
00:59:17.551 --> 00:59:17.551
<v Speaker 1>the plane couldn't have entered the </v>
<v Speaker 1>building.</v>

1235
00:59:17.551 --> 00:59:19.340
<v Speaker 1>Therefore everything is a conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you,</v>

1236
00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:20.980
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of have to address these.</v>

1237
00:59:21.590 --> 00:59:22.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to.</v>

1238
00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:27.580
<v Speaker 1>In some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's important for people before they </v>

1239
00:59:27.580 --> 00:59:27.580
<v Speaker 1>decide that this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1240
00:59:27.580 --> 00:59:32.150
<v Speaker 1>that the government spray and things in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sky or that the world is flat or </v>

1241
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:32.150
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever these things are.</v>

1242
00:59:32.150 --> 00:59:34.070
<v Speaker 1>It's important to look at all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence.</v>

1243
00:59:34.071 --> 00:59:39.071
<v Speaker 1>These youtube videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the real problems with them is </v>

1244
00:59:39.071 --> 00:59:39.230
<v Speaker 1>that they get to play out without being </v>
<v Speaker 1>interrupted.</v>

1245
00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:44.470
<v Speaker 1>Much like a podcast on unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they get to have these grand </v>

1246
00:59:45.111 --> 00:59:50.111
<v Speaker 1>statements without anyone who's an </v>
<v Speaker 1>expert stepping in and stopping them and</v>

1247
00:59:50.331 --> 00:59:50.660
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1248
00:59:50.661 --> 00:59:53.000
<v Speaker 1>that's not true and here's why it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>true and here's why.</v>

1249
00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:58.000
<v Speaker 1>He can prove that it's not true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would just derail most of these </v>

1250
00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:58.960
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy theories really quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1251
00:59:58.961 --> 01:00:01.640
<v Speaker 1>And that's kind of the brainwash aspects</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these videos.</v>

1252
01:00:01.970 --> 01:00:03.650
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1253
01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:09.340
<v Speaker 1>people watch these three hour videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of surprised me a first and I was </v>

1254
01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:12.260
<v Speaker 1>surprised that people would listen to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>three hour podcast,</v>

1255
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:13.250
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1256
01:00:13.251 --> 01:00:15.330
<v Speaker 1>once you get going in something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1257
01:00:15.370 --> 01:00:17.920
<v Speaker 1>the first time I was on your podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight at the time went by light line,</v>

1258
01:00:17.930 --> 01:00:20.270
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're into something and you get</v>

1259
01:00:20.271 --> 01:00:25.271
<v Speaker 1>sucked into it and you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've got this really interesting </v>

1260
01:00:25.271 --> 01:00:25.271
<v Speaker 1>theory and it's like all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>revelations like,</v>

1261
01:00:25.271 --> 01:00:25.780
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting the,</v>

1262
01:00:25.890 --> 01:00:28.470
<v Speaker 1>the real skinny on the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1263
01:00:29.080 --> 01:00:29.610
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1264
01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:31.280
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1265
01:00:31.530 --> 01:00:33.800
<v Speaker 1>you just get sucked in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when it's finished,</v>

1266
01:00:33.801 --> 01:00:38.801
<v Speaker 1>you on kind of a dopamine high and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do more and you also feel like </v>

1267
01:00:38.801 --> 01:00:41.270
<v Speaker 1>you're in on something that people don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>know and you want to tell them about it.</v>

1268
01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:43.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I've been there.</v>

1269
01:00:43.250 --> 01:00:48.250
<v Speaker 1>I've been there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always tell people the dumbest one </v>

1270
01:00:48.250 --> 01:00:50.660
<v Speaker 1>ever believed in was a stupid tubes that</v>
<v Speaker 1>fly through the air.</v>

1271
01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:52.610
<v Speaker 1>Rogers or.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1272
01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:54.830
<v Speaker 1>I was hook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>line and sinker.</v>

1273
01:00:54.831 --> 01:00:59.831
<v Speaker 1>I would go outside and I would try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find those things streaking across the </v>

1274
01:00:59.931 --> 01:01:01.070
<v Speaker 1>sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1275
01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:05.510
<v Speaker 1>what it was was that there was a video </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was made called Roswell rods and it</v>

1276
01:01:05.511 --> 01:01:08.630
<v Speaker 1>was trying to say that there was these </v>
<v Speaker 1>bugs,</v>

1277
01:01:09.170 --> 01:01:14.170
<v Speaker 1>like things that look like jellyfish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're flying through the air so </v>

1278
01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:14.170
<v Speaker 1>fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The naked eye couldn't see them,</v>

1279
01:01:14.170 --> 01:01:19.001
<v Speaker 1>but they were catching on video cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then finally someone figured it out </v>

1280
01:01:19.001 --> 01:01:23.350
<v Speaker 1>that what it really was was you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>have an hd camera right next to a </v>

1281
01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:27.731
<v Speaker 1>standard definition camera and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard see those things flying across </v>

1282
01:01:27.731 --> 01:01:29.150
<v Speaker 1>the sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a video artifact.</v>

1283
01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:34.310
<v Speaker 1>When the camera cannot pick up those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those bugs,</v>

1284
01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:37.820
<v Speaker 1>it elongates them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And streaks them across the camera.</v>

1285
01:01:37.830 --> 01:01:39.860
<v Speaker 1>Motion Blur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>motion blur.</v>

1286
01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:42.260
<v Speaker 1>And this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy came to one of my,</v>

1287
01:01:42.261 --> 01:01:45.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>UFC q and a's once and he waited in line</v>

1288
01:01:45.740 --> 01:01:48.440
<v Speaker 1>and he yelled out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong about the rods.</v>

1289
01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:50.330
<v Speaker 1>The rods are real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can prove it.</v>

1290
01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:55.340
<v Speaker 1>Silly Fella.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But these,</v>

1291
01:01:55.840 --> 01:02:00.470
<v Speaker 1>that was a monster quest at proven that </v>
<v Speaker 1>on television they'd set up two cameras.</v>

1292
01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:05.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so hard when it's actually been </v>

1293
01:02:05.530 --> 01:02:07.451
<v Speaker 1>proven and you've got this conclusive </v>
<v Speaker 1>proof and yet there are still loads and </v>

1294
01:02:07.451 --> 01:02:09.620
<v Speaker 1>loads of people who believe in enrolled </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't look how it looks,</v>

1295
01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:15.160
<v Speaker 1>how he was describing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like some kind of alien </v>

1296
01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:17.250
<v Speaker 1>jellyfish that's so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It flies through the air faster.</v>

1297
01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:18.560
<v Speaker 1>You can see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1298
01:02:18.561 --> 01:02:20.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean the problem is these guys have</v>

1299
01:02:20.190 --> 01:02:25.190
<v Speaker 2>a vested interest in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being real is motivated and not </v>

1300
01:02:25.190 --> 01:02:28.101
<v Speaker 2>necessarily by money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just motivated because once they </v>

1301
01:02:28.101 --> 01:02:31.761
<v Speaker 2>believe something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they feel like that privy to this </v>

1302
01:02:31.761 --> 01:02:33.831
<v Speaker 2>special knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just going to be such a letdown if </v>

1303
01:02:33.831 --> 01:02:34.290
<v Speaker 2>they're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's that end money man.</v>

1304
01:02:34.291 --> 01:02:35.850
<v Speaker 2>He sold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He sold a bunch of videos.</v>

1305
01:02:35.851 --> 01:02:37.740
<v Speaker 2>I bought them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bought two of those bitches.</v>

1306
01:02:38.650 --> 01:02:43.650
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always try to start out with the </v>

1307
01:02:43.650 --> 01:02:43.650
<v Speaker 2>assumption that people are not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1308
01:02:43.650 --> 01:02:45.180
<v Speaker 2>they're basically good people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not trying to make money.</v>

1309
01:02:45.270 --> 01:02:46.110
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1310
01:02:46.111 --> 01:02:49.260
<v Speaker 2>I think they also get caught up in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>business of whatever it is.</v>

1311
01:02:50.070 --> 01:02:55.070
<v Speaker 2>If you're in the UFO business and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone comes along and shuts down your </v>

1312
01:02:55.070 --> 01:02:56.250
<v Speaker 2>business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to try to.</v>

1313
01:02:56.251 --> 01:02:58.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me sort of.</v>

1314
01:02:58.140 --> 01:02:59.460
<v Speaker 2>They're not going to look at it </v>
<v Speaker 2>objectively.</v>

1315
01:02:59.461 --> 01:03:01.500
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to keep my business alive.</v>

1316
01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:03.000
<v Speaker 2>I want to protect my business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1317
01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:08.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost like a architects and engineers </v>

1318
01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:10.431
<v Speaker 2>when nine slash 11 truth there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like a half million dollar a </v>

1319
01:03:10.431 --> 01:03:11.040
<v Speaker 2>year business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1320
01:03:11.041 --> 01:03:15.890
<v Speaker 2>they taking between 400 and $800,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year and the precedent of the,</v>

1321
01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:20.550
<v Speaker 2>the architects and engineers as he gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>paid a salary of $85,000</v>

1322
01:03:20.551 --> 01:03:25.551
<v Speaker 2>a year and he gets these expenses paid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now that doesn't mean that he doesn't </v>

1323
01:03:25.551 --> 01:03:26.940
<v Speaker 2>believe in what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

1324
01:03:26.941 --> 01:03:31.941
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure studied how it is like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hardcore believer in nine slash 11 </v>

1325
01:03:31.941 --> 01:03:34.080
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But over the last 10 years,</v>

1326
01:03:34.590 --> 01:03:37.380
<v Speaker 2>this has become his life and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>livelihood.</v>

1327
01:03:38.250 --> 01:03:43.250
<v Speaker 2>So even if he really believes it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he still has this additional level of </v>

1328
01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:48.081
<v Speaker 2>motivation to not disprove things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people are in architects and </v>

1329
01:03:48.081 --> 01:03:50.490
<v Speaker 2>engineers for nine slash 11?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Truth really depends how you count it.</v>

1330
01:03:50.491 --> 01:03:51.290
<v Speaker 2>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1331
01:03:51.720 --> 01:03:56.720
<v Speaker 2>they say they have like thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 2>architects and engineers actually </v>

1332
01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:56.790
<v Speaker 2>signing the petition.</v>

1333
01:03:57.390 --> 01:04:02.390
<v Speaker 2>I think they have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a few hundred working structural </v>

1334
01:04:02.971 --> 01:04:04.750
<v Speaker 2>engineers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1335
01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:10.040
<v Speaker 2>what do you think of their take on it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That take is kind of like the standard </v>

1336
01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:15.320
<v Speaker 2>of a nine slash 11 truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They think that it's a controlled </v>

1337
01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:15.960
<v Speaker 2>demolition and I think they have all </v>
<v Speaker 2>this evidence.</v>

1338
01:04:15.961 --> 01:04:18.750
<v Speaker 2>We controlled demolition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not very good.</v>

1339
01:04:18.810 --> 01:04:20.050
<v Speaker 2>Evidence is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1340
01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:26.300
<v Speaker 2>one of the experts is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a high school physics teacher and you </v>

1341
01:04:27.151 --> 01:04:32.151
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's already fairly good at high school </v>

1342
01:04:32.151 --> 01:04:33.261
<v Speaker 2>physics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he just makes them very simple </v>

1343
01:04:33.261 --> 01:04:34.220
<v Speaker 2>mistakes about physics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1344
01:04:34.630 --> 01:04:36.570
<v Speaker 2>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the folding towers.</v>

1345
01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:39.750
<v Speaker 2>And they repeat this on their website,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unquestioningly.</v>

1346
01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:45.230
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's another guy who's like the </v>

1347
01:04:45.230 --> 01:04:46.380
<v Speaker 2>expert on the Nano thermite residue that</v>
<v Speaker 2>was found,</v>

1348
01:04:46.410 --> 01:04:51.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think that these reading grade </v>

1349
01:04:51.410 --> 01:04:53.180
<v Speaker 2>specs of what looks like a paint and </v>
<v Speaker 2>rust was actually a nano thermite,</v>

1350
01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:59.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since he's now like an expert on their </v>

1351
01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:02.631
<v Speaker 2>site,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets to say whatever he likes and </v>

1352
01:05:02.631 --> 01:05:05.061
<v Speaker 2>he's got this one theory about how the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bits of steel that flew out of the </v>

1353
01:05:05.061 --> 01:05:09.201
<v Speaker 2>building had these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>none of them like rockets attached to </v>

1354
01:05:09.201 --> 01:05:12.381
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why they were leaving these </v>

1355
01:05:12.381 --> 01:05:12.570
<v Speaker 2>trails of smoke behind when they fell </v>
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>

1356
01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:17.900
<v Speaker 2>And these are things that are just </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty ridiculous and you can kind of </v>

1357
01:05:17.900 --> 01:05:21.750
<v Speaker 2>debunk them with physics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they'll have none of it because </v>

1358
01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:23.770
<v Speaker 2>they've got the experts saying something</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can't,</v>

1359
01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:29.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't deny the fact that you can't </v>

1360
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:30.160
<v Speaker 2>deny that you can't to debunk their </v>
<v Speaker 2>experts because the experts,</v>

1361
01:05:30.161 --> 01:05:30.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where,</v>

1362
01:05:30.651 --> 01:05:33.040
<v Speaker 2>where would you knew more about a high </v>
<v Speaker 2>school physics teacher about physics?</v>

1363
01:05:33.250 --> 01:05:34.700
<v Speaker 2>Where would you know more about nano to </v>
<v Speaker 2>them?</v>

1364
01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:36.570
<v Speaker 2>Then this guy who was an expert in Nano </v>
<v Speaker 2>third,</v>

1365
01:05:36.571 --> 01:05:41.571
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that they've got all these supposed </v>

1366
01:05:41.571 --> 01:05:43.390
<v Speaker 2>expertise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>making these mistakes,</v>

1367
01:05:43.720 --> 01:05:45.050
<v Speaker 2>about nine slash 11,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

1368
01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:45.980
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1369
01:05:46.010 --> 01:05:51.010
<v Speaker 2>the president has this ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 2>demonstration that he does where he </v>

1370
01:05:51.010 --> 01:05:54.631
<v Speaker 2>holds up to cardboard boxes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>underneath one of them is empty space </v>

1371
01:05:54.631 --> 01:05:56.140
<v Speaker 2>underneath the other one there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a tower,</v>

1372
01:05:56.410 --> 01:06:01.410
<v Speaker 2>a drops them and the this one falls to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ground and this one bounces off the </v>

1373
01:06:01.410 --> 01:06:03.400
<v Speaker 2>cardboard box and is basically saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what should have happened.</v>

1374
01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:08.940
<v Speaker 2>This upper portion should have stopped </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the way down and it's using these </v>

1375
01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:13.681
<v Speaker 2>cardboard boxes and as a demonstration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the ridiculous oversimplifications </v>

1376
01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.250
<v Speaker 2>of what actually happened.</v>

1377
01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:21.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know too much about the </v>

1378
01:06:21.260 --> 01:06:22.760
<v Speaker 3>engineer's take on things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1379
01:06:22.830 --> 01:06:27.830
<v Speaker 3>from architects and engineers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really didn't bother getting into it </v>

1380
01:06:27.830 --> 01:06:31.730
<v Speaker 3>too much,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just do know that it's several </v>

1381
01:06:31.730 --> 01:06:34.140
<v Speaker 3>hundred people if not over a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 3>and they're all over the world.</v>

1382
01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:38.910
<v Speaker 3>But how many people have studied it that</v>
<v Speaker 3>disagree with them?</v>

1383
01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:43.520
<v Speaker 3>Like how many and how good are the </v>
<v Speaker 3>artists that are in our.</v>

1384
01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:46.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a lot of architects and a</v>
<v Speaker 3>lot of engineers</v>

1385
01:06:46.330 --> 01:06:46.910
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1386
01:06:46.911 --> 01:06:51.911
<v Speaker 2>That they recently tried to get a motion</v>
<v Speaker 2>passed at the American Institute of </v>

1387
01:06:52.040 --> 01:06:52.800
<v Speaker 2>Architects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1388
01:06:52.820 --> 01:06:57.820
<v Speaker 2>which was basically a reopen a world </v>
<v Speaker 2>trade center seven and they went to the </v>

1389
01:06:58.340 --> 01:07:01.750
<v Speaker 2>convention and they stood up and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>gave speeches and okay,</v>

1390
01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:03.500
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the evidence,</v>

1391
01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:08.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about why will the building seven </v>

1392
01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:11.960
<v Speaker 2>investigation to been reopened and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>took a vote and I think it was about </v>

1393
01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:15.590
<v Speaker 2>something like 97 to three present </v>
<v Speaker 2>against doing this.</v>

1394
01:07:15.591 --> 01:07:18.110
<v Speaker 2>So all of the architects who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually there,</v>

1395
01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:20.450
<v Speaker 2>these professional architects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>97 percent,</v>

1396
01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:24.020
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember the exact figures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's around that voted against this.</v>

1397
01:07:24.350 --> 01:07:25.910
<v Speaker 2>So even though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1398
01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:29.660
<v Speaker 2>even though there are thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 2>signatures to the,</v>

1399
01:07:29.661 --> 01:07:33.230
<v Speaker 2>a nine slash 11 petition who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually architects,</v>

1400
01:07:33.890 --> 01:07:38.890
<v Speaker 2>when you actually look at the actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>millions of architects that are out </v>

1401
01:07:38.890 --> 01:07:41.330
<v Speaker 2>there in the world is a very small </v>
<v Speaker 2>fraction of that.</v>

1402
01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:46.600
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But how many of those millions of </v>

1403
01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:46.600
<v Speaker 2>studied it.</v>

1404
01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:50.810
<v Speaker 3>I would like to see someone who's like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>real legitimate top of the food chain </v>

1405
01:07:50.810 --> 01:07:55.180
<v Speaker 3>architect from the deep debunking side </v>
<v Speaker 3>view it from someone who</v>

1406
01:07:55.550 --> 01:08:00.440
<v Speaker 2>is absolutely considered people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lots of people have done various studies</v>

1407
01:08:00.441 --> 01:08:03.320
<v Speaker 2>on nine slash 11,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the collapse of the building.</v>

1408
01:08:03.321 --> 01:08:08.321
<v Speaker 2>There was a book by a guy from London,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's cool thing through a </v>

1409
01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:13.390
<v Speaker 2>Chinese guy from London who wrote a book</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a progressive collapses in large,</v>

1410
01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:17.450
<v Speaker 2>came out last year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty Sixteen,</v>

1411
01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:21.060
<v Speaker 2>and it discusses why buildings seven </v>
<v Speaker 2>collapsed,</v>

1412
01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:23.810
<v Speaker 2>why the World Trade Center towers </v>
<v Speaker 2>collapsed amongst a whole bunch of other</v>

1413
01:08:23.811 --> 01:08:25.190
<v Speaker 2>buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why we are the collapse,</v>

1414
01:08:25.191 --> 01:08:30.191
<v Speaker 2>so it didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there are lots of people who do </v>

1415
01:08:30.191 --> 01:08:33.071
<v Speaker 2>actually study it and within a nine </v>
<v Speaker 2>slash 11 architects and engineers when </v>

1416
01:08:33.071 --> 01:08:37.301
<v Speaker 2>nine slash 11,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they vast majority of them have not </v>

1417
01:08:37.301 --> 01:08:41.261
<v Speaker 2>studied it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at their position </v>

1418
01:08:41.261 --> 01:08:41.261
<v Speaker 2>statements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look,</v>

1419
01:08:41.261 --> 01:08:45.660
<v Speaker 2>they asked everybody who joins it writes</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little statement which goes on the </v>

1420
01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:45.660
<v Speaker 2>website.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll say things like,</v>

1421
01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:49.760
<v Speaker 2>I watched loose change and that my eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah.</v>

1422
01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:53.990
<v Speaker 2>It looked weird to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like the real common thing.</v>

1423
01:08:53.991 --> 01:08:55.820
<v Speaker 2>You know that when I saw the towers </v>
<v Speaker 2>fall,</v>

1424
01:08:55.821 --> 01:08:57.830
<v Speaker 2>I knew it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know the.</v>

1425
01:08:58.370 --> 01:09:02.300
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a a regular collapsed.</v>

1426
01:09:02.330 --> 01:09:03.860
<v Speaker 2>It looked weird to me is my favorite </v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

1427
01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:05.440
<v Speaker 2>It didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it did look weird.</v>

1428
01:09:05.441 --> 01:09:07.770
<v Speaker 2>It looks weird to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Says,</v>

1429
01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:10.350
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then an architect saying it looked weird</v>

1430
01:09:10.351 --> 01:09:11.770
<v Speaker 2>to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1431
01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:16.990
<v Speaker 2>look what to everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and no one has seen anything like that </v>

1432
01:09:16.990 --> 01:09:16.990
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was unprecedented.</v>

1433
01:09:16.990 --> 01:09:18.140
<v Speaker 2>You have the Saturn five rocket taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>

1434
01:09:18.141 --> 01:09:20.300
<v Speaker 2>It looks weird because it hadn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened before.</v>

1435
01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:21.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of things that look weird.</v>

1436
01:09:23.150 --> 01:09:28.150
<v Speaker 2>What other things do you think that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I disagree on A.</v>

1437
01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:32.090
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe the morgellons are more </v>
<v Speaker 2>jealous thing.</v>

1438
01:09:32.130 --> 01:09:37.130
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are more prone to think that is a </v>

1439
01:09:37.130 --> 01:09:38.300
<v Speaker 2>real thing because you went to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>morgellons conference.</v>

1440
01:09:38.350 --> 01:09:38.820
<v Speaker 2>Not that it's</v>

1441
01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:41.550
<v Speaker 3>thing that there's real fibers growing </v>
<v Speaker 3>out of people,</v>

1442
01:09:41.730 --> 01:09:46.170
<v Speaker 3>but that there's neurotoxic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what I got from a doctor.</v>

1443
01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:51.680
<v Speaker 3>The doctor who had more Magellan's is at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the clinic who was a very reasonable </v>

1444
01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:55.161
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>William Coffee I think is that his name </v>

1445
01:09:55.161 --> 01:09:55.590
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He has lyme disease and he said the vast</v>

1446
01:09:55.591 --> 01:10:00.591
<v Speaker 3>majority of the people that have more </v>
<v Speaker 3>challenge also have lyme disease and he </v>

1447
01:10:00.591 --> 01:10:03.300
<v Speaker 3>believes that there is a neurotoxic </v>
<v Speaker 3>quality to lyme disease that affects the</v>

1448
01:10:03.301 --> 01:10:06.090
<v Speaker 3>way you see things and even causes </v>
<v Speaker 3>hallucinations.</v>

1449
01:10:06.360 --> 01:10:11.360
<v Speaker 3>And he witnessed it himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said I had hallucinated and saw </v>

1450
01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:13.680
<v Speaker 3>something crawling across the surface of</v>
<v Speaker 3>my eyeballs in the mirror,</v>

1451
01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:18.980
<v Speaker 3>but it wasn't a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't see it after I looked at it </v>

1452
01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:19.380
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was gone.</v>

1453
01:10:19.381 --> 01:10:23.730
<v Speaker 3>But I did see it for a moment and he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>convinced that lyme disease,</v>

1454
01:10:23.731 --> 01:10:27.270
<v Speaker 3>when you catch lyme disease,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not necessarily catching.</v>

1455
01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:31.110
<v Speaker 3>It's not like you know you have tylenol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know something that's isolated.</v>

1456
01:10:31.111 --> 01:10:33.390
<v Speaker 3>It's very specific.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you get tylenol,</v>

1457
01:10:33.391 --> 01:10:34.920
<v Speaker 3>you're getting tylenol.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

1458
01:10:34.921 --> 01:10:38.940
<v Speaker 3>when you get bit by a tick that has lyme</v>
<v Speaker 3>disease,</v>

1459
01:10:39.210 --> 01:10:44.210
<v Speaker 3>you could get a host of pathogens and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's what would test positive for </v>

1460
01:10:44.821 --> 01:10:47.190
<v Speaker 3>lyme disease.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very tricky to find someone to.</v>

1461
01:10:48.030 --> 01:10:50.300
<v Speaker 3>This doctor is when one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>William Lovey,</v>

1462
01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:55.380
<v Speaker 3>like he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a guy who thinks he has more </v>

1463
01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:55.380
<v Speaker 3>morgellons or he thinks he has chronic </v>
<v Speaker 3>lyme,</v>

1464
01:10:55.380 --> 01:10:58.200
<v Speaker 3>but he definitely has chronic lyme and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he thinks that what morgellons is,</v>

1465
01:10:58.230 --> 01:11:03.230
<v Speaker 3>is a side effect of chronic lyme where </v>
<v Speaker 3>people start thinking there's fibers </v>

1466
01:11:03.230 --> 01:11:07.911
<v Speaker 3>growing their skin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so they think that fibers that come </v>

1467
01:11:07.911 --> 01:11:11.841
<v Speaker 3>from their clothes or carpets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they get stuck to someplace they'd been </v>

1468
01:11:11.841 --> 01:11:13.470
<v Speaker 3>itching because they opened up a wound </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that they start</v>

1469
01:11:14.490 --> 01:11:17.460
<v Speaker 1>misinterpreting that as being something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's grown out of their skin.</v>

1470
01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:19.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I would agree with that part of it.</v>

1471
01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:21.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's what he thinks.</v>

1472
01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:23.520
<v Speaker 1>So really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not really a morgellons guy.</v>

1473
01:11:23.521 --> 01:11:26.010
<v Speaker 1>He's a chronic lyme guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes he is.</v>

1474
01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:31.070
<v Speaker 1>He's a more jealous guy in the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has seen the hallucinations,</v>

1475
01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:34.830
<v Speaker 1>but because of the fact that he's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctor and scientifically minded,</v>

1476
01:11:35.130 --> 01:11:40.130
<v Speaker 1>he believes that he's watching his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind play tricks on him and he thinks </v>

1477
01:11:40.130 --> 01:11:44.991
<v Speaker 1>there's neurotoxic qualities to whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pathogens that are in lyme disease </v>

1478
01:11:44.991 --> 01:11:45.240
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1479
01:11:45.750 --> 01:11:46.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1480
01:11:46.111 --> 01:11:49.200
<v Speaker 1>I guess I don't disagree with you too </v>
<v Speaker 1>much then I would disagree with you,</v>

1481
01:11:49.201 --> 01:11:51.930
<v Speaker 1>I think on chronic line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think you probably know more about</v>

1482
01:11:51.931 --> 01:11:56.931
<v Speaker 1>it than I do from what I've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like most doctors don't think chronic </v>

1483
01:11:56.931 --> 01:12:01.521
<v Speaker 1>lyme is a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on how long you have it for </v>

1484
01:12:01.521 --> 01:12:01.560
<v Speaker 1>before you get it treated.</v>

1485
01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:05.040
<v Speaker 1>That's the real issue is that there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>this lyme syndrome and chronic lyme,</v>

1486
01:12:05.041 --> 01:12:08.990
<v Speaker 1>which some people think there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>chronic infection and other people think</v>

1487
01:12:08.991 --> 01:12:13.991
<v Speaker 1>that there's just chronic effects </v>
<v Speaker 1>leftover from having the lyme disease </v>

1488
01:12:13.991 --> 01:12:15.540
<v Speaker 1>for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a lot of variability.</v>

1489
01:12:15.750 --> 01:12:20.750
<v Speaker 1>I think one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think we'd probably have to </v>

1490
01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:21.450
<v Speaker 1>really consult an actual lyme disease </v>
<v Speaker 1>doctor on this.</v>

1491
01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:26.600
<v Speaker 1>Not My area of expertise nor mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do have friends that have gotten </v>

1492
01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:30.261
<v Speaker 1>lyme disease and I know some people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are suffering from it to this day that </v>

1493
01:12:30.261 --> 01:12:31.920
<v Speaker 1>have like real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real terrible issues with it.</v>

1494
01:12:31.921 --> 01:12:34.230
<v Speaker 1>My friend Jim Miller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's a fighter in the UFC,</v>

1495
01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:37.470
<v Speaker 1>it's come and go with him and a terrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>way to affects,</v>

1496
01:12:37.510 --> 01:12:39.960
<v Speaker 1>greatly affects his joints and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1497
01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:42.720
<v Speaker 1>he's had to take various medications,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to get a handle on it.</v>

1498
01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:45.450
<v Speaker 1>It depends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think on the person.</v>

1499
01:12:45.480 --> 01:12:46.920
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of variables.</v>

1500
01:12:46.980 --> 01:12:51.980
<v Speaker 1>It depends on the person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on how quickly they detect the </v>

1501
01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:51.980
<v Speaker 1>lyme disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1502
01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:55.260
<v Speaker 1>my friend brought his son to the doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His son had lyme disease.</v>

1503
01:12:55.261 --> 01:13:00.261
<v Speaker 1>He brought us on to the doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The doctor didn't believe he had lyme </v>

1504
01:13:00.261 --> 01:13:00.261
<v Speaker 1>disease because that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1505
01:13:00.261 --> 01:13:03.831
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Bullseye ring around the fight had </v>

1506
01:13:03.831 --> 01:13:05.520
<v Speaker 1>gone away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which does sometimes happen.</v>

1507
01:13:06.690 --> 01:13:07.770
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

1508
01:13:07.771 --> 01:13:10.560
<v Speaker 1>it's probably nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the kid developed bell's Palsy.</v>

1509
01:13:11.050 --> 01:13:11.850
<v Speaker 1>Then they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1510
01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:16.880
<v Speaker 1>this is serious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they realized that he actually </v>

1511
01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:16.880
<v Speaker 1>does have lyme disease and he was pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>pissed.</v>

1512
01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:19.410
<v Speaker 1>The doctor didn't take him seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had the lyme disease as well.</v>

1513
01:13:19.590 --> 01:13:23.700
<v Speaker 1>He had to go on some serious intravenous</v>
<v Speaker 1>antibiotics for months.</v>

1514
01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:27.010
<v Speaker 1>It was like really heavy stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we did actually have lyme disease.</v>

1515
01:13:27.011 --> 01:13:29.850
<v Speaker 1>He had lyme disease and it devastated </v>
<v Speaker 1>him for months.</v>

1516
01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.560
<v Speaker 1>For months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't the same.</v>

1517
01:13:31.590 --> 01:13:36.590
<v Speaker 1>I think a problem with a lot of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>medical conditions is that the clinical </v>

1518
01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:39.951
<v Speaker 1>diagnoses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that the diagnosed not with </v>

1519
01:13:39.951 --> 01:13:43.010
<v Speaker 1>tests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you can do a blood and things like </v>

1520
01:13:43.010 --> 01:13:43.010
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's based on the symptoms.</v>

1521
01:13:43.010 --> 01:13:43.620
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of the times people,</v>

1522
01:13:43.621 --> 01:13:46.680
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they like to attribute their problems to</v>

1523
01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:51.740
<v Speaker 1>something and gave it a name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've got a lot of things now like </v>

1524
01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:55.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fibromyalgia a where we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

1525
01:13:55.770 --> 01:13:59.730
<v Speaker 1>we can't do a blood test usually for </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like fibromyalgia.</v>

1526
01:13:59.731 --> 01:14:01.200
<v Speaker 1>He have elevated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1527
01:14:01.710 --> 01:14:03.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>immune responses and things like that.</v>

1528
01:14:03.421 --> 01:14:05.490
<v Speaker 1>But you can't like Scifi show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is fibromyalgia.</v>

1529
01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:07.500
<v Speaker 1>It could be just a symptom of something </v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

1530
01:14:07.710 --> 01:14:12.710
<v Speaker 1>But people like to put a name on things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if people have the getting aches and </v>

1531
01:14:12.710 --> 01:14:12.710
<v Speaker 1>pains</v>

1532
01:14:12.710 --> 01:14:17.250
<v Speaker 2>or wherever they say it's Fibromyalgia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they convinced themselves as </v>

1533
01:14:17.250 --> 01:14:18.740
<v Speaker 2>fibromyalgia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And with the self diagnosis,</v>

1534
01:14:19.170 --> 01:14:21.580
<v Speaker 2>with morgellons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that happens a lot.</v>

1535
01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:27.240
<v Speaker 2>People,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people get old and your joints start to </v>

1536
01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:30.331
<v Speaker 2>ache.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your hair starts to fall out in your </v>

1537
01:14:30.331 --> 01:14:30.331
<v Speaker 2>eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>start to,</v>

1538
01:14:30.331 --> 01:14:31.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're losing your vision and your focus</v>

1539
01:14:31.570 --> 01:14:36.570
<v Speaker 2>and people think what's wrong with me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they don't realize they're just </v>

1540
01:14:36.570 --> 01:14:38.020
<v Speaker 2>getting old and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they look it up and they think they have</v>

1541
01:14:38.021 --> 01:14:40.870
<v Speaker 2>morgellons or they think they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>chronic lyme people just,</v>

1542
01:14:40.871 --> 01:14:45.871
<v Speaker 2>if they're getting ill for some reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they like to attribute the chronic </v>

1543
01:14:45.871 --> 01:14:50.520
<v Speaker 2>condition to something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they might tag on to a particular </v>

1544
01:14:50.591 --> 01:14:52.270
<v Speaker 2>thing like chronic lyme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If something,</v>

1545
01:14:52.330 --> 01:14:55.380
<v Speaker 2>if they got bit by a tick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1546
01:14:55.390 --> 01:14:59.200
<v Speaker 2>like last summer and then this summer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now they have all these problems.</v>

1547
01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:01.570
<v Speaker 2>They might self diagnosed as having </v>
<v Speaker 2>chronic lyme.</v>

1548
01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:06.700
<v Speaker 1>It is possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you do realize that there's a </v>

1549
01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:08.501
<v Speaker 1>tremendous amount of lyme disease in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>northeast and lyme disease is very real </v>

1550
01:15:08.501 --> 01:15:08.501
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's horrible,</v>

1551
01:15:08.501 --> 01:15:10.790
<v Speaker 1>horrible condition and the people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>do get it,</v>

1552
01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:13.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're pretty uniform and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that it sucks,</v>

1553
01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:18.940
<v Speaker 1>it's a terrible and it's really scary </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it really didn't kind of exist </v>

1554
01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:19.040
<v Speaker 1>just a few hundred years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1555
01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:20.860
<v Speaker 1>I don't know where it came from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1556
01:15:20.930 --> 01:15:22.000
<v Speaker 1>I just Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1557
01:15:22.130 --> 01:15:27.130
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe they didn't know what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People got it and no one had any idea </v>

1558
01:15:27.130 --> 01:15:27.130
<v Speaker 1>what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1559
01:15:27.130 --> 01:15:29.650
<v Speaker 1>It could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was discovered that village lime,</v>

1560
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:35.220
<v Speaker 1>which named after [inaudible] reminds me</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Cuban embassy thing with a song.</v>

1561
01:15:35.230 --> 01:15:36.830
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about that thing?</v>

1562
01:15:36.831 --> 01:15:37.140
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

1563
01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:40.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's there is any signing </v>
<v Speaker 2>a weapon.</v>

1564
01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:43.620
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think that I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the,</v>

1565
01:15:43.830 --> 01:15:48.830
<v Speaker 2>it's the same type of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are reporting a bunch of </v>

1566
01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:51.441
<v Speaker 2>symptoms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They haven't really done any direct </v>

1567
01:15:51.441 --> 01:15:53.760
<v Speaker 2>physical diagnosis of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People were getting ill,</v>

1568
01:15:53.790 --> 01:15:55.830
<v Speaker 2>people were reporting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hearing noises,</v>

1569
01:15:56.370 --> 01:16:01.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the noise is kind of sound like </v>

1570
01:16:01.370 --> 01:16:01.550
<v Speaker 2>cicadas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1571
01:16:01.551 --> 01:16:04.290
<v Speaker 2>and so it could have been like one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whites live in the middle of the night.</v>

1572
01:16:04.291 --> 01:16:06.870
<v Speaker 2>This is the gator in his room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jumps out of bed,</v>

1573
01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:08.220
<v Speaker 2>scared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes quiet.</v>

1574
01:16:08.490 --> 01:16:11.340
<v Speaker 2>And have you ever tried tracking as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>caterer in your yard?</v>

1575
01:16:11.650 --> 01:16:13.470
<v Speaker 2>And you get close to them and they go </v>
<v Speaker 2>quiet.</v>

1576
01:16:13.471 --> 01:16:15.750
<v Speaker 2>So you gotta start moving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets back into bed,</v>

1577
01:16:15.930 --> 01:16:17.190
<v Speaker 2>skate assaults,</v>
<v Speaker 2>buzzing again.</v>

1578
01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:22.490
<v Speaker 2>So this time was the one guy say he </v>
<v Speaker 2>tells this story to someone or he gets a</v>

1579
01:16:22.531 --> 01:16:27.531
<v Speaker 2>little lighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some unrelated thing and other people </v>

1580
01:16:27.531 --> 01:16:27.531
<v Speaker 2>say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1581
01:16:27.531 --> 01:16:28.200
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel very well either.</v>

1582
01:16:28.201 --> 01:16:29.330
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1583
01:16:29.331 --> 01:16:34.331
<v Speaker 2>at some point people sign up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make a false connection and they start </v>

1584
01:16:34.331 --> 01:16:35.640
<v Speaker 2>thinking that something actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

1585
01:16:36.030 --> 01:16:38.610
<v Speaker 2>And so they start asking people how you </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling?</v>

1586
01:16:38.660 --> 01:16:39.600
<v Speaker 2>You feeling?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1587
01:16:39.690 --> 01:16:41.250
<v Speaker 2>how's your hearing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And people say,</v>

1588
01:16:41.251 --> 01:16:41.640
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm here.</v>

1589
01:16:41.641 --> 01:16:46.641
<v Speaker 2>He's not as good as it used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My eyesight's not as good as it used to </v>

1590
01:16:46.641 --> 01:16:46.641
<v Speaker 2>baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And having these balance problems,</v>

1591
01:16:46.641 --> 01:16:49.740
<v Speaker 2>but it's just people just having normal </v>
<v Speaker 2>normal life problems.</v>

1592
01:16:49.741 --> 01:16:52.740
<v Speaker 2>They're getting old or the near the </v>
<v Speaker 2>through sickness.</v>

1593
01:16:52.741 --> 01:16:54.480
<v Speaker 2>So they've moved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>moved away,</v>

1594
01:16:55.140 --> 01:17:00.140
<v Speaker 1>pull up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull up evidence of sonic weapon in </v>

<v Speaker 1>The U s releases recordings of sonic </v>

1597

<v Speaker 5>Yes sir.</v>

1602
01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:27.800
<v Speaker 1>At least 22 people have been hurt by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mysterious high pitch sound.</v>

1603
01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:32.860
<v Speaker 1>Have they have like 22 people are sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're talk to their doctors and they </v>

1604
01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:36.890
<v Speaker 1>told them about the symptoms of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>with brain damage.</v>

1605
01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:42.040
<v Speaker 1>But it's a clinical diagnosis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know that they have sonic </v>

1606
01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:42.040
<v Speaker 1>weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1607
01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:43.460
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have weapons or something that have been</v>

1608
01:17:43.730 --> 01:17:48.730
<v Speaker 1>researched and surreal in you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>think it's entirely possible that this </v>

1609
01:17:48.730 --> 01:17:51.620
<v Speaker 1>is a sonic weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see any evidence.</v>

1610
01:17:51.670 --> 01:17:53.420
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you looked into this a lot?</v>

1611
01:17:53.490 --> 01:17:54.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1612
01:17:54.850 --> 01:17:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that if they're </v>

1613
01:17:59.850 --> 01:18:02.440
<v Speaker 1>broadcasting it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is something that the </v>

1614
01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:05.920
<v Speaker 1>government is talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're investigating and all these </v>

1615
01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:08.261
<v Speaker 1>different people are investigating it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like there's enough evidence </v>

1616
01:18:08.261 --> 01:18:09.680
<v Speaker 1>that are concerned if everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 1>reporting different things,</v>

1617
01:18:10.700 --> 01:18:13.670
<v Speaker 1>stressful conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different weapon.</v>

1618
01:18:13.890 --> 01:18:18.890
<v Speaker 1>Second US deployments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cuba panel asserts Gabby can listen my </v>

1619
01:18:20.230 --> 01:18:21.030
<v Speaker 1>thing there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1620
01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:22.390
<v Speaker 1>I Cuba like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1621
01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:27.760
<v Speaker 1>they've got an interest in figuring it </v>
<v Speaker 1>out because they didn't want to get the </v>

1622
01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:27.760
<v Speaker 1>finger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1623
01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:30.110
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably not Cuba doing it.</v>

1624
01:18:30.111 --> 01:18:35.111
<v Speaker 1>If it was somebody that will do this </v>
<v Speaker 1>after a nine month probe hampered by a </v>

1625
01:18:35.111 --> 01:18:37.910
<v Speaker 1>lack of success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lack of access to medical records.</v>

1626
01:18:37.911 --> 01:18:42.911
<v Speaker 1>A panel of Cuban scientists today </v>
<v Speaker 1>declared US diplomats here likely </v>

1627
01:18:42.911 --> 01:18:46.751
<v Speaker 1>suffered a collective psycho,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sympathetic psychogenic psychogenic </v>

1628
01:18:46.910 --> 01:18:50.000
<v Speaker 1>disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Deliberate how fast.</v>

1629
01:18:50.001 --> 01:18:54.380
<v Speaker 1>Hysteria essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So see if what evidence there is that is</v>

1630
01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:57.620
<v Speaker 1>pro this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I typed in evidence and assist it.</v>

1631
01:18:57.920 --> 01:18:59.360
<v Speaker 1>This is what came up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1632
01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:04.460
<v Speaker 1>is the latest thing is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But see if there's any other articles </v>

1633
01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:08.560
<v Speaker 1>contradict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a later thing and then this </v>

1634
01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:11.141
<v Speaker 1>word has been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say the detective changes in the </v>

1635
01:19:11.141 --> 01:19:14.561
<v Speaker 1>white matter of the brain up some people</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a bit vague and they did white </v>

1636
01:19:14.601 --> 01:19:15.410
<v Speaker 1>matter of the brain.</v>

1637
01:19:15.790 --> 01:19:18.100
<v Speaker 1>They using the Fmr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do they use them to find?</v>

1638
01:19:18.101 --> 01:19:19.190
<v Speaker 1>The.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how they did it,</v>

1639
01:19:19.250 --> 01:19:21.720
<v Speaker 1>but I can't even figure out cte and </v>
<v Speaker 1>players,</v>

1640
01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:26.900
<v Speaker 1>but who knows what caused this and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>many people actually habit and you know,</v>

1641
01:19:26.901 --> 01:19:30.170
<v Speaker 1>if one guy has changes in the white </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter of his brain,</v>

1642
01:19:30.171 --> 01:19:34.520
<v Speaker 1>who knows what that's actually due to </v>
<v Speaker 1>dot treating victims and the cat attack,</v>

1643
01:19:34.521 --> 01:19:39.521
<v Speaker 1>though I've found visible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perceptible damage to the patients' </v>

1644
01:19:39.521 --> 01:19:43.001
<v Speaker 1>brains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marking the first solid evidence that's </v>

1645
01:19:43.001 --> 01:19:44.810
<v Speaker 1>sophisticated weapon described by </v>
<v Speaker 1>embassy staff is entirely real.</v>

1646
01:19:44.811 --> 01:19:48.830
<v Speaker 1>The associate Associated Press reports </v>
<v Speaker 1>says the Associated Press based on what?</v>

1647
01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:50.630
<v Speaker 1>Based on someone at the State Department</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

1648
01:19:50.631 --> 01:19:52.000
<v Speaker 1>we're found,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1649
01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:54.590
<v Speaker 1>some damage somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1650
01:19:54.591 --> 01:19:56.060
<v Speaker 1>the State Department is covering their </v>
<v Speaker 1>ass.</v>

1651
01:19:56.061 --> 01:20:00.140
<v Speaker 1>The State Department expelled Cuban </v>
<v Speaker 1>diplomat because of this.</v>

1652
01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:02.750
<v Speaker 1>They did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

1653
01:20:02.751 --> 01:20:04.010
<v Speaker 1>the Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's our mine.</v>

1654
01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:06.190
<v Speaker 1>We did nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We did nothing.</v>

1655
01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:08.820
<v Speaker 1>Go back up there please,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Rebecca at the top,</v>

1656
01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:12.060
<v Speaker 1>they took some Americans away from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>embassy because they were sick.</v>

1657
01:20:12.390 --> 01:20:15.850
<v Speaker 1>And so they said the Cubans didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>protect the American as well.</v>

1658
01:20:15.851 --> 01:20:20.851
<v Speaker 1>He know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to have to send six </v>

1659
01:20:20.851 --> 01:20:20.851
<v Speaker 1>people back as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

1660
01:20:20.851 --> 01:20:21.890
<v Speaker 1>it says the State Department,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the FBI officials.</v>

1661
01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:25.850
<v Speaker 1>Uh Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so unlike anything,</v>

1662
01:20:25.851 --> 01:20:30.851
<v Speaker 1>the State Department,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the FBI officials I've ever seen that </v>

1663
01:20:30.851 --> 01:20:34.001
<v Speaker 1>the Cuban government's claim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the high pitched worrying sounds </v>

1664
01:20:34.001 --> 01:20:34.850
<v Speaker 1>reported by the US embassy staff are </v>
<v Speaker 1>just cicadas.</v>

1665
01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:40.240
<v Speaker 1>Seems almost plausible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Click on that link that says they're </v>

1666
01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:40.240
<v Speaker 1>just cicadas up at the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That,</v>

1667
01:20:40.260 --> 01:20:41.750
<v Speaker 1>but the same one we just saw her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

1668
01:20:41.770 --> 01:20:42.740
<v Speaker 1>Is that it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1669
01:20:43.460 --> 01:20:44.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Playing the noise.</v>

1670
01:20:47.070 --> 01:20:52.070
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a similar attack happen to </v>

1671
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:52.070
<v Speaker 1>somebody else in Uzbekistan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that Bush?</v>

1672
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:52.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1673
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:56.950
<v Speaker 1>Old School Bush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why they have a picture of is being </v>

1674
01:20:56.950 --> 01:20:56.950
<v Speaker 1>attacked by us again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1675
01:20:56.950 --> 01:20:57.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did it all.</v>

1676
01:20:58.530 --> 01:21:01.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm too weird sound for sure.</v>

1677
01:21:01.470 --> 01:21:04.740
<v Speaker 1>But I would think that um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that would be,</v>

1678
01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:05.810
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you,</v>

1679
01:21:05.910 --> 01:21:08.910
<v Speaker 1>that could damage you would be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>frequency.</v>

1680
01:21:08.911 --> 01:21:11.850
<v Speaker 1>That would be audible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1681
01:21:12.480 --> 01:21:14.220
<v Speaker 1>Well some of them reported hearing </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

1682
01:21:14.700 --> 01:21:15.750
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

1683
01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:17.610
<v Speaker 1>some people didn't report hearing </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1684
01:21:17.611 --> 01:21:20.370
<v Speaker 1>Some people had a high pitch whine that </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappeared.</v>

1685
01:21:20.371 --> 01:21:23.040
<v Speaker 1>Some people had a long lasting rumbling </v>
<v Speaker 1>noise.</v>

1686
01:21:24.330 --> 01:21:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Some people might not be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sonic vision changes all kinds of </v>

1687
01:21:29.330 --> 01:21:29.330
<v Speaker 1>different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1688
01:21:29.330 --> 01:21:32.070
<v Speaker 1>just your regular morgellons common </v>
<v Speaker 1>chronic fatigue.</v>

1689
01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:34.570
<v Speaker 1>Getting old type symptoms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>

1690
01:21:35.610 --> 01:21:39.240
<v Speaker 1>So you think that someone started </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about this being an issue,</v>

1691
01:21:39.241 --> 01:21:41.280
<v Speaker 1>that they're being attacked and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody started freaking out?</v>

1692
01:21:41.340 --> 01:21:42.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's possible.</v>

1693
01:21:42.510 --> 01:21:47.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think probably something happened </v>

1694
01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:49.191
<v Speaker 1>like the esm guy heard something and </v>
<v Speaker 1>jumped out of bed and it stopped and </v>

1695
01:21:49.191 --> 01:21:52.461
<v Speaker 1>then got back into bed and it started </v>
<v Speaker 1>again and someone else had something </v>

1696
01:21:52.461 --> 01:21:55.140
<v Speaker 1>similar happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's funny because if you were in Cuba</v>

1697
01:21:55.260 --> 01:21:58.500
<v Speaker 1>and they didn't want you there and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>heard weird noises like goddammit,</v>

1698
01:21:58.620 --> 01:22:01.710
<v Speaker 1>they're attacking me with a sound ray </v>
<v Speaker 1>and people are being.</v>

1699
01:22:02.070 --> 01:22:07.070
<v Speaker 1>People are being harassed in Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you work at the American </v>

1700
01:22:07.070 --> 01:22:07.070
<v Speaker 1>embassy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get harassed.</v>

1701
01:22:07.070 --> 01:22:10.560
<v Speaker 1>New Sonic attack against American </v>
<v Speaker 1>diplomat suggest Russian involvement.</v>

1702
01:22:10.620 --> 01:22:12.120
<v Speaker 1>Palm Palm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Palm.</v>

1703
01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:14.910
<v Speaker 1>The Russians did it through twitter </v>
<v Speaker 1>bots.</v>

1704
01:22:16.410 --> 01:22:21.390
<v Speaker 1>When you click on the twitter bots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they send sound through your earbuds.</v>

1705
01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:23.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are saying like,</v>

1706
01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:24.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>linking the CICADAS,</v>

1707
01:22:24.811 --> 01:22:27.570
<v Speaker 1>causing the hearing loss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no one's actually saying the CICADAS</v>

1708
01:22:27.660 --> 01:22:29.370
<v Speaker 1>are causing people to lose their </v>
<v Speaker 1>hearing.</v>

1709
01:22:29.910 --> 01:22:31.240
<v Speaker 1>They just saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1710
01:22:31.590 --> 01:22:36.590
<v Speaker 1>people sometimes get reductions in their</v>
<v Speaker 1>hearing as they get older and maybe </v>

1711
01:22:36.590 --> 01:22:39.270
<v Speaker 1>they're noticing it because they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>focusing on it so much.</v>

1712
01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:41.130
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why those diseases,</v>

1713
01:22:41.131 --> 01:22:43.620
<v Speaker 1>people think I'm sick and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>focus on something.</v>

1714
01:22:43.621 --> 01:22:48.621
<v Speaker 1>Like if you feel like you're itching a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit and you think you've got some kind </v>

1715
01:22:48.621 --> 01:22:50.850
<v Speaker 1>of weird pathogen under your skin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just gonna itch more and more,</v>

1716
01:22:50.851 --> 01:22:52.350
<v Speaker 1>you're going to feel more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>itching.</v>

1717
01:22:52.710 --> 01:22:57.710
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if people weren't really paying </v>

1718
01:22:57.710 --> 01:22:57.710
<v Speaker 1>attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I have like mild tinnitus,</v>

1719
01:22:57.710 --> 01:22:59.910
<v Speaker 1>ringing in the ears from video games or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

1720
01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:02.700
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Headphones they said yeah,</v>

1721
01:23:02.701 --> 01:23:03.720
<v Speaker 1>it could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

1722
01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:05.890
<v Speaker 1>people get tested,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get older for no reason.</v>

1723
01:23:05.891 --> 01:23:08.560
<v Speaker 1>Some people you're going to loud </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerts or whatever.</v>

1724
01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:11.760
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time I don't even think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it in my.</v>

1725
01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:16.600
<v Speaker 1>I might have never even noticed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if I stopped and listened to my,</v>

1726
01:23:16.770 --> 01:23:18.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in my ears,</v>

1727
01:23:18.101 --> 01:23:21.820
<v Speaker 1>I can hear this tonight is the noise in </v>
<v Speaker 1>my ear very,</v>

1728
01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:22.930
<v Speaker 1>very quietly.</v>

1729
01:23:23.590 --> 01:23:24.880
<v Speaker 1>So if someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1730
01:23:24.881 --> 01:23:27.930
<v Speaker 1>I think we're being bombarded by sonic </v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons like a.</v>

1731
01:23:28.030 --> 01:23:30.430
<v Speaker 1>can you hear any ringing in your ear or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything like that?</v>

1732
01:23:30.431 --> 01:23:34.090
<v Speaker 1>And then you go quiet and you listen and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start noticing these things.</v>

1733
01:23:35.330 --> 01:23:37.300
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

1734
01:23:37.930 --> 01:23:40.510
<v Speaker 1>Do people are very susceptible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1735
01:23:40.930 --> 01:23:43.430
<v Speaker 1>psychosomatic illnesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're absolutely very real.</v>

1736
01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:44.710
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a thing called sick,</v>

1737
01:23:45.310 --> 01:23:47.800
<v Speaker 1>sick building syndrome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1738
01:23:47.801 --> 01:23:52.090
<v Speaker 1>which is possibly a real thing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly a psychogenic thing,</v>

1739
01:23:52.091 --> 01:23:55.210
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of people think that a sick </v>
<v Speaker 1>building syndrome,</v>

1740
01:23:55.630 --> 01:23:57.720
<v Speaker 1>a lot of the times when it happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like when you.</v>

1741
01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:01.270
<v Speaker 1>Lots of people working in the same place</v>
<v Speaker 1>get similar symptoms,</v>

1742
01:24:01.720 --> 01:24:04.240
<v Speaker 1>it's happening because of this mass </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychogenic illness.</v>

1743
01:24:04.241 --> 01:24:08.170
<v Speaker 1>One person says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel sick and everyone kind of assumes</v>

1744
01:24:08.171 --> 01:24:11.140
<v Speaker 1>it's something in the environment around</v>
<v Speaker 1>them that's causing that.</v>

1745
01:24:11.410 --> 01:24:13.090
<v Speaker 1>And so they kind of feel sick as well.</v>

1746
01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:18.420
<v Speaker 1>This a disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I had heard of someone's talking </v>

1747
01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:18.730
<v Speaker 1>about this one's called Allah phrenia I </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe,</v>

1748
01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:23.620
<v Speaker 1>and that it's when people go to visit </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who have schizophrenia,</v>

1749
01:24:23.860 --> 01:24:25.630
<v Speaker 1>when they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they hang out with those people,</v>

1750
01:24:25.631 --> 01:24:29.200
<v Speaker 1>they start developing very bizarre </v>
<v Speaker 1>behavior of their own.</v>

1751
01:24:29.560 --> 01:24:33.010
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes they have to be monitored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's kind of weird.</v>

1752
01:24:33.250 --> 01:24:34.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounds well.</v>

1753
01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:39.840
<v Speaker 1>We all know that some people are way </v>
<v Speaker 1>more susceptible to suggestion way more </v>

1754
01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:41.980
<v Speaker 1>susceptible to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever been hypnotized?</v>

1755
01:24:41.981 --> 01:24:42.580
<v Speaker 1>Now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't.</v>

1756
01:24:42.670 --> 01:24:43.690
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating.</v>

1757
01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:44.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1758
01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:49.280
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I wouldn't be hypnotizable </v>

1759
01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:50.710
<v Speaker 1>saying that everybody thinks that I </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought that too,</v>

1760
01:24:50.740 --> 01:24:53.530
<v Speaker 1>but I did it with a friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friend Vinny shoreman did it to me,</v>

1761
01:24:53.531 --> 01:24:57.760
<v Speaker 1>so I trusted him and I just let it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a registered licensed hypnotist and</v>

1762
01:24:57.761 --> 01:25:02.761
<v Speaker 1>he works with a lot of athletes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of fighters in particular and </v>

1763
01:25:02.761 --> 01:25:04.630
<v Speaker 1>basically just puts you in a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>bizarre state of mind,</v>

1764
01:25:04.631 --> 01:25:06.310
<v Speaker 1>but you're aware of it the whole time.</v>

1765
01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:10.210
<v Speaker 1>It's not like some mentoring candidate </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing where they're going to wake up mic</v>

1766
01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:15.960
<v Speaker 1>now you're an assassin for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government and you'll run out the door </v>

1767
01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:15.960
<v Speaker 1>and your underwear like captain </v>
<v Speaker 1>underpants.</v>

1768
01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:17.170
<v Speaker 1>Do you know captain underpants says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have kids?</v>

1769
01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:18.730
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do know her.</v>

1770
01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:21.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My kids love captain underpants.</v>

1771
01:25:21.641 --> 01:25:24.130
<v Speaker 1>Friend of mine told me I should try </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypnotizing my wife.</v>

1772
01:25:25.630 --> 01:25:29.710
<v Speaker 1>He didn't specify exactly the way he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1773
01:25:29.740 --> 01:25:34.740
<v Speaker 1>he keeps his relationship going is by </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypnotizes them every couple of nights.</v>

1774
01:25:34.931 --> 01:25:37.340
<v Speaker 1>He hypnotizes his wife and just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1775
01:25:37.630 --> 01:25:39.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know exactly what happens.</v>

1776
01:25:39.131 --> 01:25:40.450
<v Speaker 1>He's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't really specify,</v>

1777
01:25:40.451 --> 01:25:45.451
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he highly recommended humanizing my </v>

1778
01:25:45.451 --> 01:25:45.451
<v Speaker 1>wife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1779
01:25:45.451 --> 01:25:48.781
<v Speaker 1>That guy sounds like a creep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's doing some weird shit to his wife </v>

1780
01:25:48.781 --> 01:25:49.090
<v Speaker 1>who's a nice guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe not when he's got that,</v>

1781
01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:52.550
<v Speaker 1>that stopwatch hanging on a string.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why was,</v>

1782
01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:53.380
<v Speaker 1>it was always a watch.</v>

1783
01:25:53.380 --> 01:25:54.430
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Follow the watch.</v>

1784
01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:56.500
<v Speaker 1>Very.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're kidding.</v>

1785
01:25:56.501 --> 01:25:58.210
<v Speaker 1>TRIPI.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1786
01:25:58.211 --> 01:26:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's real hypnosis.</v>

1787
01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:02.380
<v Speaker 1>Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was wondering,</v>

1788
01:26:02.460 --> 01:26:02.960
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>

1789
01:26:03.530 --> 01:26:04.670
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is this like?</v>

1790
01:26:04.700 --> 01:26:06.350
<v Speaker 1>Is it the bullshit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they,</v>

1791
01:26:06.390 --> 01:26:11.050
<v Speaker 1>it really does put you in a very unusual</v>
<v Speaker 1>state and when you get out of it there,</v>

1792
01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:16.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can go through a lot of stuff that </v>

1793
01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:18.101
<v Speaker 1>you have like maybe cluttering around </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside your mind and reorganize after a </v>

1794
01:26:18.101 --> 01:26:19.010
<v Speaker 1>hypnotic session.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty interesting.</v>

1795
01:26:19.790 --> 01:26:21.230
<v Speaker 1>It's a reason why people use it for </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1796
01:26:21.930 --> 01:26:26.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quitting smoking and things on those </v>

1797
01:26:26.930 --> 01:26:26.930
<v Speaker 1>lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1798
01:26:26.930 --> 01:26:30.551
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this just shows how malleable the human </v>

1799
01:26:30.551 --> 01:26:30.551
<v Speaker 1>brain is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1800
01:26:30.551 --> 01:26:30.551
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

1801
01:26:30.551 --> 01:26:32.150
<v Speaker 1>it goes back to that whole thing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>being brainwashed by youtube,</v>

1802
01:26:32.570 --> 01:26:34.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people make documentaries,</v>

1803
01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:37.190
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way to hypnotize people.</v>

1804
01:26:37.710 --> 01:26:38.490
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1805
01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:43.960
<v Speaker 1>they structure it in a way that you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>these images coming at you and these </v>

1806
01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:47.891
<v Speaker 1>ideas and they slaves reinforcement of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things in a way that will actually just </v>

1807
01:26:48.410 --> 01:26:53.000
<v Speaker 1>kind of embed this idea in your brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>without you even really realizing it.</v>

1808
01:26:53.240 --> 01:26:58.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll say things like you are being </v>

1809
01:26:58.240 --> 01:26:58.240
<v Speaker 1>lied to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And with the,</v>

1810
01:26:58.240 --> 01:27:01.530
<v Speaker 1>the thing that kills me too is that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>use oftentimes a hypnotic voice like </v>

1811
01:27:01.530 --> 01:27:01.880
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eric Do,</v>

1812
01:27:01.881 --> 01:27:06.170
<v Speaker 1>big Iowa does those flat earth videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He talks in a very hypnotic manner.</v>

1813
01:27:06.290 --> 01:27:09.880
<v Speaker 1>It's like very calm and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

1814
01:27:09.900 --> 01:27:14.900
<v Speaker 1>The nine slash 11 videos as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This nice woman dictating it behind the </v>

1815
01:27:16.011 --> 01:27:18.860
<v Speaker 1>buildings could not possibly a fall in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they did.</v>

1816
01:27:19.070 --> 01:27:21.120
<v Speaker 1>Physics proves it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1817
01:27:21.170 --> 01:27:23.540
<v Speaker 1>it looks like we're going to have eric </v>
<v Speaker 1>do bay.</v>

1818
01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:26.990
<v Speaker 1>He said he's agreed to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talk with Neil degrasse Tyson.</v>

1819
01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:33.500
<v Speaker 1>We're going to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to skype in from Thailand or </v>

1820
01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:33.920
<v Speaker 1>wherever the fuck he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1821
01:27:34.010 --> 01:27:36.470
<v Speaker 1>I think it's in Thailand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how he gets there with flat</v>

1822
01:27:36.471 --> 01:27:37.500
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How'd you get here?</v>

1823
01:27:37.790 --> 01:27:40.910
<v Speaker 1>That's still in the northern hemisphere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Thailand scoop over there.</v>

1824
01:27:41.210 --> 01:27:42.830
<v Speaker 1>Shoot over there and avoid the ice wall.</v>

1825
01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:46.970
<v Speaker 1>But he doesn't believe in dinosaurs </v>
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

1826
01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:50.150
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a crazy guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>

1827
01:27:50.151 --> 01:27:55.151
<v Speaker 1>You think he doesn't believe in say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if he believes in </v>

1828
01:27:55.151 --> 01:27:55.151
<v Speaker 1>satellites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think he believes in nuclear</v>

1829
01:27:55.151 --> 01:27:57.350
<v Speaker 1>bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Antisemites as well.</v>

1830
01:27:57.351 --> 01:27:58.840
<v Speaker 1>I think it was him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1831
01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:03.160
<v Speaker 1>That's unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Subculture in the movement of A.</v>

1832
01:28:04.620 --> 01:28:06.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nazis type people.</v>

1833
01:28:07.190 --> 01:28:12.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the conspiracy theory goes </v>

1834
01:28:12.190 --> 01:28:12.190
<v Speaker 1>back to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1835
01:28:12.190 --> 01:28:14.600
<v Speaker 1>the rothschilds running the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they think is these,</v>

1836
01:28:14.601 --> 01:28:15.630
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1837
01:28:15.650 --> 01:28:20.650
<v Speaker 1>this certain sector of the Jewish race </v>
<v Speaker 1>who weren't actually in control of </v>

1838
01:28:20.650 --> 01:28:24.071
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And these are the people who were </v>

1839
01:28:24.071 --> 01:28:24.071
<v Speaker 1>stopping you from the debate is not me </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying this.</v>

1840
01:28:24.071 --> 01:28:27.230
<v Speaker 1>I have no knowledge whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're anti-semite don't chicken out.</v>

1841
01:28:28.420 --> 01:28:33.290
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty easy to verify a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos explaining his position on it.</v>

1842
01:28:33.390 --> 01:28:38.390
<v Speaker 1>My favorite thing is that he's my friend</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie Bravo is kind of buying into some </v>

1843
01:28:38.390 --> 01:28:40.790
<v Speaker 1>of his shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Witch tortures me to no end,</v>

1844
01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:44.690
<v Speaker 1>but Eddie is one of the greatest Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 1>coaches on planet earth.</v>

1845
01:28:44.790 --> 01:28:49.790
<v Speaker 1>He's an amazing Jujitsu coach in Jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 1>competitor and one of Eric [inaudible] </v>

1846
01:28:49.790 --> 01:28:52.670
<v Speaker 1>biggest videos is about how Jujitsu is </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit.</v>

1847
01:28:56.560 --> 01:28:58.100
<v Speaker 1>It just shows you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does,</v>

1848
01:28:58.101 --> 01:28:59.180
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>About that.</v>

1849
01:28:59.181 --> 01:29:02.550
<v Speaker 1>It's about wing Chung Kung Fu defeats </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu,</v>

1850
01:29:03.180 --> 01:29:05.040
<v Speaker 1>which is by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not true.</v>

1851
01:29:05.100 --> 01:29:10.100
<v Speaker 1>Don't try it unless you're like way </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger and the guy sucks that Hugh </v>

1852
01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:14.390
<v Speaker 1>Jitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She those guys in a room together and </v>

1853
01:29:14.390 --> 01:29:14.390
<v Speaker 1>they can just fight it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>

1854
01:29:14.390 --> 01:29:16.170
<v Speaker 1>They would just talk about conspiracies </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the end of time.</v>

1855
01:29:16.710 --> 01:29:19.410
<v Speaker 1>Eddie loves conspiracies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would like to talk to Eddie.</v>

1856
01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:21.900
<v Speaker 1>We can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's screaming,</v>

1857
01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:24.420
<v Speaker 1>screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might have to get you some earplugs here</v>

1858
01:29:24.421 --> 01:29:25.260
<v Speaker 1>tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said kick him.</v>

1859
01:29:25.290 --> 01:29:27.180
<v Speaker 1>He's interesting because he knows so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much about them all.</v>

1860
01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:29.000
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really interesting.</v>

1861
01:29:29.180 --> 01:29:30.210
<v Speaker 1>Confuses me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1862
01:29:30.211 --> 01:29:33.360
<v Speaker 1>how much time do you have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do you have the time for this?</v>

1863
01:29:33.390 --> 01:29:38.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's spouting off this advanced physics </v>

1864
01:29:38.390 --> 01:29:40.560
<v Speaker 1>references like Mickelson areas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>failure and things like that.</v>

1865
01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:46.100
<v Speaker 1>Those are the flat earth science </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiments that supposedly proved the </v>

1866
01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:46.500
<v Speaker 1>wasn't moving.</v>

1867
01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:50.610
<v Speaker 1>That one's hilarious to me because when </v>
<v Speaker 1>I first brought it up to Eddie,</v>

1868
01:29:50.850 --> 01:29:54.750
<v Speaker 1>Jamie pulled this up and send it to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other day that I first brought it up</v>

1869
01:29:54.751 --> 01:29:57.630
<v Speaker 1>to Eddie from like eight years ago on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the podcast,</v>

1870
01:29:57.631 --> 01:30:02.631
<v Speaker 1>one of the really early podcast when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>still did it in my house on a couch and </v>

1871
01:30:03.270 --> 01:30:08.270
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the most ridiculous conspiracy </v>

1872
01:30:08.270 --> 01:30:08.270
<v Speaker 1>theory?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're hurt?</v>

1873
01:30:08.270 --> 01:30:08.270
<v Speaker 1>And I said flat earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's like,</v>

1874
01:30:08.270 --> 01:30:09.960
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people don't believe the earth is flat.</v>

1875
01:30:10.620 --> 01:30:15.620
<v Speaker 1>So he went from that to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he's at 100 percent </v>

1876
01:30:15.620 --> 01:30:17.610
<v Speaker 1>convinced that it's flat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's definitely willing to listen.</v>

1877
01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:22.880
<v Speaker 1>He's down the rabbit hole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got sacked and he loves it and it's </v>

1878
01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:23.790
<v Speaker 1>probably like a lot of it is just from </v>
<v Speaker 1>him watching endless youtube.</v>

1879
01:30:23.791 --> 01:30:25.650
<v Speaker 1>It's 100 percent what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here it is right here.</v>

1880
01:30:28.510 --> 01:30:30.810
<v Speaker 1>The worst conspiracy to like the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

1881
01:30:30.840 --> 01:30:35.840
<v Speaker 1>flat earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's people that are flat to the </v>

1882
01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:35.840
<v Speaker 1>young earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's another bad one.</v>

1883
01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:35.890
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1884
01:30:35.891 --> 01:30:36.810
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like today,</v>

1885
01:30:36.811 --> 01:30:41.811
<v Speaker 1>people don't believe that that's a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>percentage of the Christian population </v>

1886
01:30:42.330 --> 01:30:47.330
<v Speaker 1>dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went with young earth there for some </v>

1887
01:30:47.330 --> 01:30:47.330
<v Speaker 1>fucking stranger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were all baked.</v>

1888
01:30:47.550 --> 01:30:50.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably unfortunately.</v>

1889
01:30:50.161 --> 01:30:52.890
<v Speaker 1>But that was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was when he found out about flatter</v>

1890
01:30:52.900 --> 01:30:54.690
<v Speaker 1>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was,</v>

1891
01:30:54.750 --> 01:30:57.000
<v Speaker 1>you started him down the rabbit thousand</v>
<v Speaker 1>episodes ago.</v>

1892
01:30:57.780 --> 01:30:59.350
<v Speaker 1>What episode was that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifty four.</v>

1893
01:30:59.430 --> 01:31:02.970
<v Speaker 1>So that was probably 2010.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First year.</v>

1894
01:31:03.140 --> 01:31:04.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1895
01:31:04.900 --> 01:31:07.920
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was even big on the Internet by the</v>

1896
01:31:07.980 --> 01:31:11.790
<v Speaker 1>head of the curve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe responsible for this whole thing.</v>

1897
01:31:14.070 --> 01:31:19.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he and I used to watch ufo things </v>

1898
01:31:19.070 --> 01:31:19.070
<v Speaker 1>forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he got off a Ufo.</v>

1899
01:31:19.070 --> 01:31:19.890
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes in waves,</v>

1900
01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:21.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie goes in waves.</v>

1901
01:31:21.750 --> 01:31:26.300
<v Speaker 1>We were both like really into Ufos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in particular Zechariah situation,</v>

1902
01:31:26.580 --> 01:31:28.100
<v Speaker 1>that was the big one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1903
01:31:28.110 --> 01:31:30.030
<v Speaker 1>Zechariah stitching is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you've talked about it,</v>

1904
01:31:30.031 --> 01:31:35.031
<v Speaker 1>unless the Sumerian text guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wrote a the reason why a 10th planet </v>

1905
01:31:36.391 --> 01:31:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Jiu Jitsu is June 10th planet Jiu Jitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1906
01:31:40.770 --> 01:31:45.770
<v Speaker 1>I actually came up with the name and one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the reasons why I came up with the </v>

1907
01:31:45.770 --> 01:31:48.621
<v Speaker 1>names because we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Zechariah stitching and the idea is </v>

1908
01:31:48.621 --> 01:31:48.621
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1909
01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:51.450
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this came from another planet.</v>

1910
01:31:51.480 --> 01:31:56.370
<v Speaker 1>We actually came up with the name before</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pluto had been changed from a,</v>

1911
01:31:56.400 --> 01:32:00.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they decided as a downgraded it.</v>

1912
01:32:00.490 --> 01:32:05.490
<v Speaker 1>So we decided that this Jujitsu was </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming from another planet like out </v>

1913
01:32:05.490 --> 01:32:08.911
<v Speaker 1>there where the Annunaki live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was based on Zechariah Hitchen's </v>

1914
01:32:08.911 --> 01:32:08.950
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Twelfth Planet.</v>

1915
01:32:09.460 --> 01:32:14.460
<v Speaker 1>And his book was all about Planet Nibiru</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that the Sumerian texts were when </v>

1916
01:32:17.051 --> 01:32:19.240
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you decide for them correctly,</v>

1917
01:32:19.241 --> 01:32:24.241
<v Speaker 1>they all described this ancient race </v>
<v Speaker 1>that came from this other planet that </v>

1918
01:32:24.241 --> 01:32:28.441
<v Speaker 1>has this elliptical orbit that comes in </v>
<v Speaker 1>between Earth and Mars and Jupiter </v>

1919
01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:33.670
<v Speaker 1>somewhere somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It comes near Earth every 3000,</v>

1920
01:32:33.671 --> 01:32:38.671
<v Speaker 1>600 years and that there's a group of </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings called the Annunaki created human</v>

1921
01:32:39.611 --> 01:32:44.611
<v Speaker 1>beings by coming down here and taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and taking lower primates and </v>

1922
01:32:46.121 --> 01:32:48.740
<v Speaker 1>injecting their dna into them and blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

1923
01:32:48.741 --> 01:32:49.180
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were,</v>

1924
01:32:49.181 --> 01:32:51.430
<v Speaker 1>we were balls deep into that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a big one.</v>

1925
01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:54.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>type thing like the ancient aliens,</v>

1926
01:32:54.050 --> 01:32:57.760
<v Speaker 1>there's something that's really at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>far end of the conspiracy spectrum,</v>

1927
01:32:58.210 --> 01:33:00.320
<v Speaker 1>but you still get people who like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1928
01:33:00.330 --> 01:33:01.750
<v Speaker 1>chem trail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believers who believe it.</v>

1929
01:33:02.020 --> 01:33:05.380
<v Speaker 1>One of the guys you interviewed a Scott </v>
<v Speaker 1>Stevens.</v>

1930
01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:07.090
<v Speaker 1>There's a meteorologist.</v>

1931
01:33:07.090 --> 01:33:07.930
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1932
01:33:07.931 --> 01:33:11.140
<v Speaker 1>He was into like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he believed chem trails 100 percent.</v>

1933
01:33:11.141 --> 01:33:11.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1934
01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:14.670
<v Speaker 1>He also believes in aliens and they did </v>
<v Speaker 1>it that type of hockey,</v>

1935
01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:17.740
<v Speaker 1>like white holes and things disbelieve </v>
<v Speaker 1>in aliens.</v>

1936
01:33:17.980 --> 01:33:20.950
<v Speaker 1>What I disbelieve is people that are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>contact with them,</v>

1937
01:33:20.980 --> 01:33:21.800
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1938
01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:23.070
<v Speaker 1>I think the idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1939
01:33:23.110 --> 01:33:24.430
<v Speaker 1>the Fermi Paradox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1940
01:33:24.750 --> 01:33:29.750
<v Speaker 1>The idea that there's so many planets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many galaxies and so many solar </v>

1941
01:33:29.750 --> 01:33:32.620
<v Speaker 1>systems that the odds of life being out </v>
<v Speaker 1>there so high.</v>

1942
01:33:32.621 --> 01:33:34.750
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why have we not been contacted?</v>

1943
01:33:34.990 --> 01:33:36.760
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1944
01:33:36.850 --> 01:33:39.310
<v Speaker 1>it is entirely possible in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>estimation,</v>

1945
01:33:39.311 --> 01:33:44.311
<v Speaker 1>as a moron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we are the most advanced life form </v>

1946
01:33:44.311 --> 01:33:48.060
<v Speaker 1>in the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's entirely possible because we exist </v>

1947
01:33:48.060 --> 01:33:49.030
<v Speaker 1>because we are the most advanced life </v>
<v Speaker 1>form on earth.</v>

1948
01:33:50.110 --> 01:33:51.370
<v Speaker 1>We know that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1949
01:33:51.371 --> 01:33:54.010
<v Speaker 1>As far as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as far as like communicating things that</v>

1950
01:33:54.011 --> 01:33:56.680
<v Speaker 1>we've discovered in 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are the most advanced.</v>

1951
01:33:56.890 --> 01:33:59.110
<v Speaker 1>It's entirely possible that were the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most advanced everywhere.</v>

1952
01:33:59.111 --> 01:34:00.970
<v Speaker 1>So I want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to be right.</v>

1953
01:34:01.700 --> 01:34:02.600
<v Speaker 1>It could be us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

1954
01:34:02.660 --> 01:34:03.770
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People say like,</v>

1955
01:34:03.780 --> 01:34:05.270
<v Speaker 1>you know what are the odds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1956
01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:07.360
<v Speaker 1>what are the odds of us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first person,</v>

1957
01:34:07.690 --> 01:34:12.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever wins the lottery because by the </v>

1958
01:34:12.690 --> 01:34:12.690
<v Speaker 1>Alex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he happened to that person.</v>

1959
01:34:12.690 --> 01:34:16.310
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that it's very unlikely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like we're running lots of </v>

1960
01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:18.781
<v Speaker 1>universities and see what happens was </v>
<v Speaker 1>also there's a direct one progression </v>

1961
01:34:18.781 --> 01:34:22.291
<v Speaker 1>that you could follow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what are the odds of someone </v>

1962
01:34:22.291 --> 01:34:22.930
<v Speaker 1>inventing the iphone 10 and 2017.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1963
01:34:23.170 --> 01:34:25.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what that's how long it </v>
<v Speaker 1>took.</v>

1964
01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:27.700
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is exactly what happened.</v>

1965
01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:31.330
<v Speaker 1>This is what we track it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can go back to the iphone 1:10</v>

1966
01:34:31.331 --> 01:34:32.350
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real simple.</v>

1967
01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:34.480
<v Speaker 1>People.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People use the argument.</v>

1968
01:34:34.490 --> 01:34:36.490
<v Speaker 1>It's like what is the probability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1969
01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:38.050
<v Speaker 1>In weird ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like people say,</v>

1970
01:34:38.051 --> 01:34:43.051
<v Speaker 1>what is the profitability of three </v>
<v Speaker 1>planes falling from two free free </v>

1971
01:34:43.051 --> 01:34:44.710
<v Speaker 1>buildings falling two planes hitting </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

1972
01:34:45.340 --> 01:34:46.940
<v Speaker 1>because if that argument actually makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>any sense.</v>

1973
01:34:47.010 --> 01:34:48.200
<v Speaker 1>Shitty argument.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1974
01:34:48.730 --> 01:34:49.960
<v Speaker 1>They bring it up all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1975
01:34:49.961 --> 01:34:54.961
<v Speaker 1>what are the odds you who get so lucky </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you would have three planes pre </v>

1976
01:34:54.961 --> 01:34:56.950
<v Speaker 1>buildings on the same day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't make any sense.</v>

1977
01:34:56.960 --> 01:34:57.620
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>

1978
01:34:57.650 --> 01:34:58.230
<v Speaker 1>but people</v>

1979
01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:00.110
<v Speaker 2>don't say things like the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

1980
01:35:00.170 --> 01:35:02.360
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's to support confirmation bias,</v>

1981
01:35:02.660 --> 01:35:07.660
<v Speaker 2>so I think that it's entirely possible </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we the only advanced life form in </v>

1982
01:35:07.660 --> 01:35:12.011
<v Speaker 2>the universe or it's entirely possible </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they are incredibly advanced </v>

1983
01:35:12.011 --> 01:35:14.000
<v Speaker 2>lifeforms that really aren't interested </v>
<v Speaker 2>in us and quarantined.</v>

1984
01:35:14.080 --> 01:35:19.080
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's possible to look at our fucking </v>

1985
01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:20.480
<v Speaker 2>president and we have a wacky president </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just lies all the time.</v>

1986
01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:25.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the purpose was studied </v>

1987
01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:26.950
<v Speaker 2>crunching as a bit a bit earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what would you see?</v>

1988
01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:32.020
<v Speaker 2>What you would go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people don't know what the fuck </v>

1989
01:35:32.020 --> 01:35:33.461
<v Speaker 2>they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to figure out if they're going </v>

1990
01:35:33.461 --> 01:35:34.250
<v Speaker 2>to blow each other up and pay close </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention to them.</v>

1991
01:35:34.251 --> 01:35:37.430
<v Speaker 2>See if they don't poison their water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like figure out what they're going to do</v>

1992
01:35:37.431 --> 01:35:40.640
<v Speaker 2>first before we give them new technology</v>
<v Speaker 2>or anything.</v>

1993
01:35:40.670 --> 01:35:41.900
<v Speaker 2>You okay with people?</v>

1994
01:35:41.900 --> 01:35:44.210
<v Speaker 2>If this thing's out there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably machines.</v>

1995
01:35:44.770 --> 01:35:47.150
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's.</v>

1996
01:35:47.210 --> 01:35:51.140
<v Speaker 2>You look at the advances in ai and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's going on now.</v>

1997
01:35:51.790 --> 01:35:56.790
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's many civilizations</v>
<v Speaker 2>can really survive sync.</v>

1998
01:35:57.531 --> 01:36:00.140
<v Speaker 2>Biological life has its time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1999
01:36:00.170 --> 01:36:05.170
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people talk about lighting a terminator </v>

2000
01:36:05.170 --> 01:36:09.851
<v Speaker 2>and skynet and things like that and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>robots taking over and I think that's </v>

2001
01:36:09.851 --> 01:36:11.850
<v Speaker 2>actually a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we.</v>

2002
01:36:11.940 --> 01:36:14.360
<v Speaker 2>You seem like these robots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2003
01:36:14.390 --> 01:36:15.890
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're pretty crappy now,</v>

2004
01:36:15.891 --> 01:36:20.891
<v Speaker 2>but yet got to the stage where they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>do back flips and things and it's not </v>

2005
01:36:20.891 --> 01:36:25.490
<v Speaker 2>too much further along the line like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundred years from now.</v>

2006
01:36:25.491 --> 01:36:30.491
<v Speaker 2>It's like a blink at the universities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will have robots that can do </v>

2007
01:36:30.491 --> 01:36:34.211
<v Speaker 2>everything that humans can do and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely indistinguishable to from </v>

2008
01:36:34.370 --> 01:36:38.690
<v Speaker 2>from people and how you choose to be and</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not just any distinguishable.</v>

2009
01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:41.380
<v Speaker 2>They will be humans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus they'll be like gods.</v>

2010
01:36:41.470 --> 01:36:42.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will.</v>

2011
01:36:42.460 --> 01:36:47.460
<v Speaker 2>We do hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands or millions of times more </v>

2012
01:36:47.460 --> 01:36:49.950
<v Speaker 2>powerful than humans in terms of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>processing power and news,</v>

2013
01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:54.970
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of times more powerful in terms</v>
<v Speaker 2>of their strength and that's 100 years </v>

2014
01:36:54.970 --> 01:36:54.970
<v Speaker 2>from now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2015
01:36:54.970 --> 01:36:55.340
<v Speaker 2>We're really close to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2016
01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:56.810
<v Speaker 2>because it's going to be an explosive </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2017
01:36:56.860 --> 01:36:58.870
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this thing in ai now cold.</v>

2018
01:36:58.871 --> 01:37:00.600
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh.</v>

2019
01:37:01.940 --> 01:37:03.280
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alrighty Dan,</v>

2020
01:37:03.290 --> 01:37:08.290
<v Speaker 2>because I forgot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a generative adaptive networks </v>

2021
01:37:08.290 --> 01:37:11.170
<v Speaker 2>which has this way of doing ai where the</v>
<v Speaker 2>robots basically basically teach </v>

2022
01:37:11.170 --> 01:37:15.251
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have one robot who is judging </v>

2023
01:37:15.251 --> 01:37:18.521
<v Speaker 2>things and there's a robot that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>creating things and the robot that's </v>

2024
01:37:18.521 --> 01:37:21.350
<v Speaker 2>creating things teaches the robot that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>judging things,</v>

2025
01:37:21.351 --> 01:37:23.240
<v Speaker 2>how to judge and the robots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the judging things,</v>

2026
01:37:23.241 --> 01:37:28.241
<v Speaker 2>teachers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the creating robots how to create and </v>

2027
01:37:28.241 --> 01:37:28.241
<v Speaker 2>then they just go back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back and forth.</v>

2028
01:37:28.241 --> 01:37:31.360
<v Speaker 2>So the old way of doing ai was like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>would teach a robot to do things and you</v>

2029
01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:33.620
<v Speaker 2>correct it when it goes wrong and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>tweak the algorithm,</v>

2030
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:36.470
<v Speaker 2>but now you've got these robots that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>learning things incredibly,</v>

2031
01:37:36.530 --> 01:37:39.410
<v Speaker 2>incredibly rapidly by teaching </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves how to do things.</v>

2032
01:37:39.860 --> 01:37:44.860
<v Speaker 2>And the humans who are running these </v>
<v Speaker 2>robots don't actually understand how </v>

2033
01:37:44.860 --> 01:37:49.481
<v Speaker 2>this actually works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You end up with this huge big matrix of </v>

2034
01:37:49.481 --> 01:37:51.110
<v Speaker 2>numbers which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2035
01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:56.200
<v Speaker 2>no one can actually decipher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the results come out of it that </v>

2036
01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:56.200
<v Speaker 2>they've got things like now where</v>

2037
01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:57.100
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2038
01:37:57.720 --> 01:38:02.720
<v Speaker 1>you can take a scene in a video and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can turn night into day or you can turn </v>

2039
01:38:02.720 --> 01:38:05.160
<v Speaker 1>a snow scene into a summer season </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they can,</v>

2040
01:38:05.220 --> 01:38:10.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the robots and the ai knows how to do </v>

2041
01:38:10.220 --> 01:38:10.220
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is just the tip of the iceberg.</v>

2042
01:38:10.220 --> 01:38:11.850
<v Speaker 1>There's so much more coming down the </v>
<v Speaker 1>line.</v>

2043
01:38:12.180 --> 01:38:12.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2044
01:38:12.830 --> 01:38:14.880
<v Speaker 1>I saw something that was incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>disturbing.</v>

2045
01:38:14.881 --> 01:38:18.570
<v Speaker 1>They said that when robots become </v>
<v Speaker 1>sentient,</v>

2046
01:38:18.720 --> 01:38:22.560
<v Speaker 1>like when they have the ability to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>up their own decisions and do things for</v>

2047
01:38:22.561 --> 01:38:27.561
<v Speaker 1>themselves and they first thing they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to do is improve upon their own </v>

2048
01:38:27.561 --> 01:38:27.840
<v Speaker 1>design.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2049
01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:31.800
<v Speaker 1>And they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll will be able to have 10,000</v>

2050
01:38:31.801 --> 01:38:34.530
<v Speaker 1>years of human propel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if,</v>

2051
01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:39.600
<v Speaker 1>if humans were evolving technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a robot or a sentient ai could do 10,000</v>

2052
01:38:42.151 --> 01:38:45.030
<v Speaker 1>years worth of technological advancement</v>
<v Speaker 1>in two weeks.</v>

2053
01:38:45.090 --> 01:38:47.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And is that real?</v>

2054
01:38:47.740 --> 01:38:52.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because computers just run so much </v>

2055
01:38:52.740 --> 01:38:54.090
<v Speaker 1>faster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just think about that number two weeks.</v>

2056
01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:56.520
<v Speaker 1>So think about how long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000</v>

2057
01:38:56.521 --> 01:39:00.210
<v Speaker 1>years ago was for civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is probably a little bit optimistic</v>

2058
01:39:00.211 --> 01:39:05.211
<v Speaker 1>in terms of like actual physical </v>
<v Speaker 1>development because they can't make </v>

2059
01:39:05.211 --> 01:39:05.440
<v Speaker 1>prototypes fast enough to try the out </v>
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>

2060
01:39:05.460 --> 01:39:06.240
<v Speaker 1>Again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't sleep.</v>

2061
01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:08.700
<v Speaker 1>They will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll have these little robots.</v>

2062
01:39:08.701 --> 01:39:11.610
<v Speaker 1>Then the enemy fuck robots can move so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much faster.</v>

2063
01:39:11.970 --> 01:39:12.950
<v Speaker 1>We do kill them.</v>

2064
01:39:15.050 --> 01:39:16.670
<v Speaker 1>Pioneer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So scientists acts.</v>

2065
01:39:16.830 --> 01:39:18.890
<v Speaker 1>Some scientists are saying that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>should actually not.</v>

2066
01:39:18.990 --> 01:39:21.390
<v Speaker 1>We should put the brakes on this Ai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them,</v>

2067
01:39:21.391 --> 01:39:22.050
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2068
01:39:22.180 --> 01:39:27.180
<v Speaker 1>But it's funny thing that seems like </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're moving towards the edge of the </v>

2069
01:39:27.180 --> 01:39:27.180
<v Speaker 1>cliff and everyone's going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

2070
01:39:27.180 --> 01:39:31.731
<v Speaker 1>we should probably hit the brakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also such a lucrative thing for </v>

2071
01:39:31.731 --> 01:39:32.080
<v Speaker 1>people to do because if you get really </v>
<v Speaker 1>good ai you can.</v>

2072
01:39:32.130 --> 01:39:33.340
<v Speaker 1>You can sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2073
01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:36.150
<v Speaker 1>And the army is going to want robot </v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers.</v>

2074
01:39:36.930 --> 01:39:37.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got these,</v>

2075
01:39:37.741 --> 01:39:40.050
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these drones with guns mounted on them.</v>

2076
01:39:41.210 --> 01:39:43.590
<v Speaker 1>If you imagine you've got like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That scares the shit out man.</v>

2077
01:39:43.591 --> 01:39:45.900
<v Speaker 1>What are you showing me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This I'm going to hit play.</v>

2078
01:39:45.901 --> 01:39:50.130
<v Speaker 1>It's really fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sorting a ripe ripe tomatoes really</v>

2079
01:39:50.131 --> 01:39:55.131
<v Speaker 1>quick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll slow it down here in a second </v>

2080
01:39:55.131 --> 01:39:55.131
<v Speaker 1>fastest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

2081
01:39:55.131 --> 01:39:57.450
<v Speaker 1>How can it see the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

2082
01:39:57.600 --> 01:40:00.480
<v Speaker 1>So it sees the green tomatoes and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>just knocks him out.</v>

2083
01:40:00.690 --> 01:40:02.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>

2084
01:40:02.580 --> 01:40:04.860
<v Speaker 1>Because the computer is essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing what we're seeing now.</v>

2085
01:40:04.861 --> 01:40:06.540
<v Speaker 1>He's hitting them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

2086
01:40:06.541 --> 01:40:09.360
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

2087
01:40:09.450 --> 01:40:14.160
<v Speaker 1>So as they're coming down this ramp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these computers are.</v>

2088
01:40:14.220 --> 01:40:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's in real time.</v>

2089
01:40:16.090 --> 01:40:17.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit Dude.</v>

2090
01:40:17.700 --> 01:40:22.700
<v Speaker 1>So he's got this computer vision that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>processing it and because computers are </v>

2091
01:40:22.700 --> 01:40:23.140
<v Speaker 1>fast enough to do this now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my God,</v>

2092
01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:25.050
<v Speaker 1>we're fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just gonna get festival.</v>

2093
01:40:25.810 --> 01:40:28.680
<v Speaker 1>So fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That scares the shit out of me more than</v>

2094
01:40:28.681 --> 01:40:32.940
<v Speaker 1>the backflipping robot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that backflipping robot can move</v>

2095
01:40:33.330 --> 01:40:34.440
<v Speaker 1>really fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2096
01:40:34.441 --> 01:40:38.250
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what Elon Musk said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You won't be able to see him use.</v>

2097
01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:39.950
<v Speaker 1>Have a strobe light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2098
01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:45.200
<v Speaker 1>And you know they're going to be super </v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate shooting things and take your </v>

2099
01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:45.200
<v Speaker 1>eye out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2100
01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:46.410
<v Speaker 1>They're not gonna have any trigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>panic.</v>

2101
01:40:46.700 --> 01:40:49.410
<v Speaker 1>Just going to be able to just be like </v>
<v Speaker 1>robots.</v>

2102
01:40:49.500 --> 01:40:51.780
<v Speaker 1>God Damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

2103
01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:56.840
<v Speaker 1>that's a real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a real to put down the chem </v>

2104
01:40:56.840 --> 01:40:59.251
<v Speaker 1>trails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walk away from the flat earth and </v>

2105
01:40:59.251 --> 01:41:00.400
<v Speaker 1>understand that there's sentient robots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you,</v>

2106
01:41:00.490 --> 01:41:00.870
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2107
01:41:00.871 --> 01:41:03.400
<v Speaker 1>you have a background in computers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did you,</v>

2108
01:41:03.790 --> 01:41:08.790
<v Speaker 1>what was your take on that whole thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Google had to shut down these two </v>

2109
01:41:09.491 --> 01:41:14.491
<v Speaker 1>computers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicating with each other because </v>

2110
01:41:14.491 --> 01:41:14.780
<v Speaker 1>they started talking in a language that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't understand the.</v>

2111
01:41:14.900 --> 01:41:19.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I was talking about that </v>

2112
01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:19.900
<v Speaker 1>with the generative adapted networks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they uh,</v>

2113
01:41:21.320 --> 01:41:26.320
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have to shut them down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they did because they were a little </v>

2114
01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:26.320
<v Speaker 1>freaked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2115
01:41:26.320 --> 01:41:28.050
<v Speaker 1>they shut them down because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't do anything with them.</v>

2116
01:41:28.900 --> 01:41:33.900
<v Speaker 1>It was the two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two computers talking to each other in </v>

2117
01:41:33.900 --> 01:41:33.900
<v Speaker 1>Gobbledygook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say if it was something interesting,</v>

2118
01:41:33.900 --> 01:41:35.200
<v Speaker 1>they would have kept them and studied </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2119
01:41:35.390 --> 01:41:37.510
<v Speaker 1>The thing that they knew what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>computers are saying,</v>

2120
01:41:37.830 --> 01:41:39.460
<v Speaker 1>computers knew what they're saying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

2121
01:41:39.540 --> 01:41:40.100
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2122
01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:42.690
<v Speaker 1>It was just some kind of loop that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>got stuck in.</v>

2123
01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:47.700
<v Speaker 1>It probably wasn't particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligent or anything so much more </v>

2124
01:41:47.700 --> 01:41:51.061
<v Speaker 1>ominous to say that they have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>language they weren't like plotting to </v>

2125
01:41:51.061 --> 01:41:54.691
<v Speaker 1>take over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you know it's because we aren't </v>

2126
01:41:54.691 --> 01:41:55.840
<v Speaker 1>there yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they would've already done it.</v>

2127
01:41:55.890 --> 01:41:58.480
<v Speaker 1>The first things computers do sexually </v>
<v Speaker 1>harass each other.</v>

2128
01:41:59.140 --> 01:42:04.120
<v Speaker 1>They send Computer Dick Pics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would that even look like the other</v>

2129
01:42:04.121 --> 01:42:06.340
<v Speaker 1>day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what's the AI gender going to be?</v>

2130
01:42:06.430 --> 01:42:09.070
<v Speaker 1>Has anyone decided or has it been talked</v>
<v Speaker 1>about?</v>

2131
01:42:09.100 --> 01:42:14.100
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's what's going on with all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this crazy push to accept 78 different </v>

2132
01:42:16.061 --> 01:42:21.061
<v Speaker 1>gender pronouns and non binary people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and all this stuff that didn't exist in </v>

2133
01:42:21.061 --> 01:42:22.050
<v Speaker 1>the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe were move.</v>

2134
01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:27.120
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's like a natural inclination</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the human species to move towards a </v>

2135
01:42:27.521 --> 01:42:30.770
<v Speaker 1>genderless prototype of the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

2136
01:42:30.970 --> 01:42:33.220
<v Speaker 1>we went into this in depth yesterday </v>
<v Speaker 1>under the influence,</v>

2137
01:42:33.580 --> 01:42:35.260
<v Speaker 1>obviously we did a podcast.</v>

2138
01:42:35.260 --> 01:42:40.150
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about like what an alien</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the archetype alien with the big head</v>

2139
01:42:40.470 --> 01:42:45.470
<v Speaker 1>in the very thin body and the mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like barely visible that.</v>

2140
01:42:45.491 --> 01:42:50.200
<v Speaker 1>I think that this is probably what we </v>
<v Speaker 1>see ourselves becoming when we have some</v>

2141
01:42:50.201 --> 01:42:52.600
<v Speaker 1>sort of a symbiotic relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>

2142
01:42:52.601 --> 01:42:57.601
<v Speaker 1>When technology becomes a part of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we have the ability to manipulate </v>

2143
01:42:57.601 --> 01:42:59.470
<v Speaker 1>genes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is absolutely coming,</v>

2144
01:42:59.620 --> 01:43:04.600
<v Speaker 1>and then we have this enormous head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I mean look at our heads,</v>

2145
01:43:04.601 --> 01:43:06.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not very practical.</v>

2146
01:43:06.420 --> 01:43:11.420
<v Speaker 1>Enormous head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neil degrasse Tyson was talking about </v>

2147
01:43:11.420 --> 01:43:11.420
<v Speaker 1>this recently being all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were talking.</v>

2148
01:43:11.420 --> 01:43:13.810
<v Speaker 1>He was talking to Ray Kurzweil in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>

2149
01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:16.150
<v Speaker 1>I was listening to Ray Kurzweil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the futurist,</v>

2150
01:43:16.151 --> 01:43:21.151
<v Speaker 1>and they were talking about the size of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a human head and that human head could </v>

2151
01:43:21.151 --> 01:43:24.880
<v Speaker 1>only get so big because of the mortality</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue with the mother,</v>

2152
01:43:25.020 --> 01:43:30.020
<v Speaker 1>like the mother could not give birth to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the head can only be so big and that </v>

2153
01:43:30.020 --> 01:43:34.741
<v Speaker 1>it's also one of the reasons why folding</v>
<v Speaker 1>over the skull in our heads are so big </v>

2154
01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:40.560
<v Speaker 1>that we have to be born like almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>helpless as opposed to like other </v>

2155
01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:40.960
<v Speaker 1>animals that are born.</v>

2156
01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:43.300
<v Speaker 1>They're pretty pretty agile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like right out of the box,</v>

2157
01:43:43.301 --> 01:43:45.820
<v Speaker 1>like a deer or a horse or something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2158
01:43:46.050 --> 01:43:51.050
<v Speaker 1>Or even primates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Primates have very little body fat on </v>

2159
01:43:51.050 --> 01:43:52.820
<v Speaker 1>them and they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're much stronger than a young human</v>

2160
01:43:52.821 --> 01:43:57.821
<v Speaker 1>baby and that the design of the vagina </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the head like leaves,</v>

2161
01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:02.720
<v Speaker 1>little room for advancement in the state</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're going as far as it can go,</v>

2162
01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:06.590
<v Speaker 1>but if we move away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking from China,</v>

2163
01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:08.110
<v Speaker 1>from Vagina's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

2164
01:44:08.520 --> 01:44:10.100
<v Speaker 1>not genres,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ladies.</v>

2165
01:44:10.370 --> 01:44:13.250
<v Speaker 1>That's not what I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm saying is move towards some</v>

2166
01:44:13.251 --> 01:44:15.650
<v Speaker 1>sort of a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Vat.</v>

2167
01:44:15.740 --> 01:44:18.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something there can put together in some</v>

2168
01:44:18.501 --> 01:44:23.501
<v Speaker 1>sort of a new concoction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a new artificial womb that </v>

2169
01:44:23.601 --> 01:44:26.210
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have any size constraints.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you want a big hat?</v>

2170
01:44:26.690 --> 01:44:31.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't give a fuck about what you </v>

2171
01:44:31.690 --> 01:44:33.311
<v Speaker 1>look like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big head would allow you to see the </v>

2172
01:44:33.311 --> 01:44:33.311
<v Speaker 1>future that you could have massive cut </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

2173
01:44:33.311 --> 01:44:33.830
<v Speaker 1>That would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a freaky one.</v>

2174
01:44:33.940 --> 01:44:35.470
<v Speaker 1>That's not ready yet because it is a big</v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

2175
01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:41.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's that version of the alien or </v>

2176
01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:41.200
<v Speaker 1>there's the bodybuilder alien from </v>
<v Speaker 1>fetus,</v>

2177
01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:43.550
<v Speaker 1>which seems less likely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a grunt.</v>

2178
01:44:43.551 --> 01:44:46.260
<v Speaker 1>I think just the missing link.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now.</v>

2179
01:44:46.310 --> 01:44:47.450
<v Speaker 1>But I think like with the big head </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>

2180
01:44:47.470 --> 01:44:52.470
<v Speaker 1>like I don't think you need to grow </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger brains behave and you could </v>

2181
01:44:52.470 --> 01:44:55.391
<v Speaker 1>probably do a lot better by having some </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of implant silicon type thing and </v>

2182
01:44:55.391 --> 01:44:56.840
<v Speaker 1>that little computer running in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain.</v>

2183
01:44:56.870 --> 01:45:00.760
<v Speaker 1>But what if you had a huge computer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 100 iphones,</v>

2184
01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:01.580
<v Speaker 1>dom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dom,</v>

2185
01:45:01.581 --> 01:45:06.581
<v Speaker 1>dom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he covered a bigger brains as well </v>

2186
01:45:06.581 --> 01:45:09.521
<v Speaker 1>because there's a limit to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's apply like your brain is already </v>

2187
01:45:09.521 --> 01:45:11.741
<v Speaker 1>using if you're using so you can have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have oxygen tanks so strapped to your </v>

2188
01:45:11.741 --> 01:45:13.310
<v Speaker 1>back to what if we go away from all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff?</v>

2189
01:45:13.370 --> 01:45:16.280
<v Speaker 1>What have they figured out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some sort of a vision way.</v>

2190
01:45:16.650 --> 01:45:18.170
<v Speaker 1>Just have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

2191
01:45:18.171 --> 01:45:20.840
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before there's a.</v>

2192
01:45:20.841 --> 01:45:25.841
<v Speaker 1>They put a lamb out and had it in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial womb and it survived for a </v>

2193
01:45:25.841 --> 01:45:28.130
<v Speaker 1>few weeks at least when I was growing up</v>
<v Speaker 1>or we were like a few weeks.</v>

2194
01:45:28.150 --> 01:45:30.350
<v Speaker 1>I worked a little sort of science </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiction.</v>

2195
01:45:30.470 --> 01:45:34.700
<v Speaker 1>Now what will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that's entirely possible for</v>

2196
01:45:34.701 --> 01:45:38.240
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the idea of human beings moving</v>

2197
01:45:38.241 --> 01:45:43.241
<v Speaker 1>away from biological bodies and if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out a way to download </v>

2198
01:45:43.341 --> 01:45:45.380
<v Speaker 1>consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one a Kurzweil's things,</v>

2199
01:45:45.381 --> 01:45:50.381
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To figure out a way to get to a point </v>

2200
01:45:50.381 --> 01:45:51.920
<v Speaker 1>where consciousness is something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be transferred as a freaky idea that</v>

2201
01:45:51.980 --> 01:45:53.960
<v Speaker 1>freaky to me because as someone like Kim</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jong,</v>

2202
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:58.990
<v Speaker 1>Uhm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we makes a thousand of himself and </v>

2203
01:45:58.990 --> 01:46:02.110
<v Speaker 1>fucking put them all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if consciousness gets taken over,</v>

2204
01:46:02.601 --> 01:46:07.601
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually die and you just.</v>

2205
01:46:07.820 --> 01:46:10.730
<v Speaker 1>This robot facsimile of you is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>continues.</v>

2206
01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:13.430
<v Speaker 1>What if you make two copies of yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2207
01:46:13.670 --> 01:46:18.260
<v Speaker 1>Do you want them as a sky diver?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The trial bull riding?</v>

2208
01:46:18.261 --> 01:46:20.450
<v Speaker 1>Because if you can hit a button,</v>
<v Speaker 1>download someone's consciousness.</v>

2209
01:46:20.451 --> 01:46:23.050
<v Speaker 1>You can you imagine if that's what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to do.</v>

2210
01:46:23.060 --> 01:46:27.830
<v Speaker 1>You just do all reckless shit with one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of your body and you start mma fighting.</v>

2211
01:46:27.831 --> 01:46:30.710
<v Speaker 1>And then would you like download that </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience back into your other buddy?</v>

2212
01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:32.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just die.</v>

2213
01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:33.660
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would download it.</v>

2214
01:46:33.661 --> 01:46:37.070
<v Speaker 1>You'd have the other body on steroids </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have the other body like working</v>

2215
01:46:37.071 --> 01:46:42.071
<v Speaker 1>out at the Olympic training center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And turn the other body until like a </v>

2216
01:46:42.071 --> 01:46:45.011
<v Speaker 1>super athlete and then the one that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>sky dive in and doing backflips with the</v>

2217
01:46:45.890 --> 01:46:50.890
<v Speaker 1>augmented brains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to come along before </v>

2218
01:46:50.890 --> 01:46:50.890
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're,</v>

2219
01:46:50.890 --> 01:46:50.890
<v Speaker 1>I think it's something</v>

2220
01:46:50.890 --> 01:46:55.100
<v Speaker 2>that with ai is coming along is like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bots chat bots on the Internet actually </v>

2221
01:46:55.100 --> 01:46:56.610
<v Speaker 2>creating content.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2222
01:46:57.000 --> 01:47:02.000
<v Speaker 2>Not just like creating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like talking things like posts on </v>

2223
01:47:02.000 --> 01:47:02.000
<v Speaker 2>Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can create pictures like these,</v>

2224
01:47:02.110 --> 01:47:07.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these networks I was talking about can </v>

2225
01:47:07.110 --> 01:47:08.280
<v Speaker 2>actually create videos that looked like </v>
<v Speaker 2>real videos.</v>

2226
01:47:08.550 --> 01:47:13.550
<v Speaker 2>So I think you're going to get actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>content creators which are artificial </v>

2227
01:47:13.550 --> 01:47:17.271
<v Speaker 2>intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like youtube personalities that are </v>

2228
01:47:17.271 --> 01:47:20.310
<v Speaker 2>actually artificial intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But some of them will be overt like,</v>

2229
01:47:20.311 --> 01:47:21.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the is Google's new bots,</v>

2230
01:47:22.050 --> 01:47:23.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>posting on the Internet going,</v>

2231
01:47:23.431 --> 01:47:24.560
<v Speaker 2>hey everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Google,</v>

2232
01:47:25.150 --> 01:47:25.880
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2233
01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:31.200
<v Speaker 2>and then you'll get people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll get ais pretending to be real </v>

2234
01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:34.491
<v Speaker 2>people and then you get these ais </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretending to be real people in </v>

2235
01:47:34.491 --> 01:47:39.170
<v Speaker 2>thousands if not millions of social </v>
<v Speaker 2>media accounts trying to influence </v>

2236
01:47:39.361 --> 01:47:41.250
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2237
01:47:41.330 --> 01:47:43.530
<v Speaker 2>Then you talk about like Bot nets and </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

2238
01:47:43.531 --> 01:47:47.490
<v Speaker 2>but that just like people just posting </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit like reposting memes and things,</v>

2239
01:47:47.850 --> 01:47:52.850
<v Speaker 2>what if you actually get an artificial </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence that can actually hold a </v>

2240
01:47:52.850 --> 01:47:56.841
<v Speaker 2>conversation with someone at an </v>
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligence that's actually </v>

2241
01:47:56.841 --> 01:48:00.111
<v Speaker 2>more intelligent than the person that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're holding is holding the </v>

2242
01:48:00.111 --> 01:48:00.111
<v Speaker 2>conversation with it.</v>

2243
01:48:00.111 --> 01:48:04.640
<v Speaker 2>We'll be able to manipulate that person </v>
<v Speaker 2>and control them and since it's a </v>

2244
01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:08.750
<v Speaker 2>computer doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could have thousands or millions of </v>

2245
01:48:08.750 --> 01:48:12.471
<v Speaker 2>them and you could do all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>targeted like social media campaigns </v>

2246
01:48:13.050 --> 01:48:14.130
<v Speaker 2>going on right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2247
01:48:14.131 --> 01:48:18.090
<v Speaker 2>but they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not actually like a habit.</v>

2248
01:48:18.160 --> 01:48:21.090
<v Speaker 2>It's not an artificial intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 2>having a real conversation with people.</v>

2249
01:48:21.270 --> 01:48:26.270
<v Speaker 2>We're on the verge of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they do have artificial bots that </v>

2250
01:48:26.270 --> 01:48:27.950
<v Speaker 2>will go out and attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People do have things on those.</v>

2251
01:48:27.970 --> 01:48:29.880
<v Speaker 2>The simplistic things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're spamming things.</v>

2252
01:48:29.970 --> 01:48:32.640
<v Speaker 2>You can tell there are bought fairly </v>
<v Speaker 2>easily for now.</v>

2253
01:48:32.700 --> 01:48:37.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're getting to the stage where you </v>

2254
01:48:37.700 --> 01:48:37.700
<v Speaker 2>won't be able to tell that it's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ball.</v>

2255
01:48:37.700 --> 01:48:40.050
<v Speaker 2>They'll be someone who would be in in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>few decades.</v>

2256
01:48:40.051 --> 01:48:45.051
<v Speaker 2>There'll be people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'll be artificial intelligence is </v>

2257
01:48:45.051 --> 01:48:47.820
<v Speaker 2>that will be just as intelligent as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>or me and we'll be able to have the same</v>

2258
01:48:47.821 --> 01:48:52.530
<v Speaker 2>conversations on social media that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I can have on social media right now</v>

2259
01:48:52.800 --> 01:48:53.790
<v Speaker 2>and people wouldn't be able to tell.</v>

2260
01:48:53.790 --> 01:48:56.820
<v Speaker 2>The difference is this big famous test </v>
<v Speaker 2>in ai,</v>

2261
01:48:56.821 --> 01:48:59.340
<v Speaker 2>which is the cheering test where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>test is.</v>

2262
01:48:59.341 --> 01:49:04.341
<v Speaker 2>Someone sits in a room with a typewriter</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they talked to the computer in the </v>

2263
01:49:04.341 --> 01:49:04.350
<v Speaker 2>other room when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can tell it's a computer,</v>

2264
01:49:05.030 --> 01:49:10.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it passes the turing test and it's </v>

2265
01:49:10.030 --> 01:49:10.290
<v Speaker 2>meant to be intelligent and they can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell that it's a computer.</v>

2266
01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:11.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If as a computer.</v>

2267
01:49:11.970 --> 01:49:15.170
<v Speaker 2>So there's been very limited successes </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that if you like,</v>

2268
01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:19.770
<v Speaker 2>restricts the topics to just baseball or</v>
<v Speaker 2>Britney spears or something like that.</v>

2269
01:49:19.771 --> 01:49:24.771
<v Speaker 2>They had these very limited domains that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can talk about that if you get a </v>

2270
01:49:24.771 --> 01:49:28.161
<v Speaker 2>general purpose ai that is actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent and can and has goals to </v>

2271
01:49:28.161 --> 01:49:30.780
<v Speaker 2>change someone's mind about something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like politics,</v>

2272
01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:33.230
<v Speaker 2>you could have a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2273
01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:38.280
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about Duncan and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>yesterday were saying think about </v>

2274
01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:41.660
<v Speaker 2>someone creating an artificial version </v>
<v Speaker 2>of him based on the hundreds of hours of</v>

2275
01:49:42.091 --> 01:49:47.091
<v Speaker 2>his audio recordings because he has so </v>
<v Speaker 2>many podcasts as do I know if somebody </v>

2276
01:49:47.091 --> 01:49:47.091
<v Speaker 2>wanted to take a</v>

2277
01:49:49.780 --> 01:49:54.780
<v Speaker 3>like mine where there's a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 3>episodes and take those thousand plus </v>

2278
01:49:54.780 --> 01:49:58.300
<v Speaker 3>episodes and take my opinions and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way I describe things,</v>

2279
01:49:58.301 --> 01:50:01.270
<v Speaker 3>the way I talk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean like if you're talking to me in a</v>

2280
01:50:01.271 --> 01:50:03.220
<v Speaker 3>podcast like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're just talking to me.</v>

2281
01:50:03.221 --> 01:50:04.570
<v Speaker 3>This is what I talk like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so.</v>

2282
01:50:04.710 --> 01:50:06.700
<v Speaker 3>And you'd get a bunch of variables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2283
01:50:06.701 --> 01:50:09.400
<v Speaker 3>You get me excited,</v>
<v Speaker 3>me depressed me,</v>

2284
01:50:09.401 --> 01:50:11.050
<v Speaker 3>shocked me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sad me.</v>

2285
01:50:11.051 --> 01:50:14.560
<v Speaker 3>Happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would have so much to choose from.</v>

2286
01:50:14.561 --> 01:50:16.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could look kind of material.</v>

2287
01:50:16.510 --> 01:50:20.830
<v Speaker 3>You could kind of like fill in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>blanks and guests pretty accurately.</v>

2288
01:50:20.831 --> 01:50:23.040
<v Speaker 3>How I would react or respond to certain.</v>

2289
01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:27.820
<v Speaker 2>One of the episodes of Black Mirror,</v>
<v Speaker 2>British TV show,</v>

2290
01:50:28.170 --> 01:50:29.080
<v Speaker 2>great show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2291
01:50:29.140 --> 01:50:32.650
<v Speaker 2>It was about some woman whose husband </v>
<v Speaker 2>had died,</v>

2292
01:50:33.250 --> 01:50:38.250
<v Speaker 2>but he had all this video of him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a service that set up an ai </v>

2293
01:50:38.771 --> 01:50:40.810
<v Speaker 2>version offerman and it starts out </v>
<v Speaker 2>small,</v>

2294
01:50:40.811 --> 01:50:45.811
<v Speaker 2>like someone who would post on social </v>
<v Speaker 2>media as him and eventually it grew to </v>

2295
01:50:46.061 --> 01:50:48.650
<v Speaker 2>be this don't spoil alert me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2296
01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:51.220
<v Speaker 2>I just watched an episode of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other day is a good.</v>

2297
01:50:51.380 --> 01:50:53.440
<v Speaker 2>That one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

2298
01:50:53.470 --> 01:50:54.640
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a good episode.</v>

2299
01:50:54.670 --> 01:50:55.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so good.</v>

2300
01:50:55.360 --> 01:51:00.360
<v Speaker 2>I watched one the other day about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>video games that they put that thing in </v>

2301
01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:00.360
<v Speaker 2>the back of your head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that one?</v>

2302
01:51:00.580 --> 01:51:03.480
<v Speaker 2>It's in the new season.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This also too.</v>

2303
01:51:03.560 --> 01:51:04.540
<v Speaker 2>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>

2304
01:51:04.840 --> 01:51:06.760
<v Speaker 2>That's a great show and it's come out a </v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of weeks.</v>

2305
01:51:07.210 --> 01:51:07.800
<v Speaker 2>Three weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2306
01:51:08.770 --> 01:51:11.770
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan does not like it though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Freaked out.</v>

2307
01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:16.920
<v Speaker 2>It is a bit creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she hears too much of that shit </v>

2308
01:51:16.920 --> 01:51:16.920
<v Speaker 2>from me to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2309
01:51:16.920 --> 01:51:18.460
<v Speaker 2>she just gets freaked out on technology </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the future.</v>

2310
01:51:18.900 --> 01:51:20.170
<v Speaker 2>The possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

2311
01:51:20.171 --> 01:51:25.171
<v Speaker 2>like making a fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jurgen is something that is possible to </v>

2312
01:51:25.171 --> 01:51:28.920
<v Speaker 2>easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can probably do something if they </v>

2313
01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:28.920
<v Speaker 2>put enough resources in just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2314
01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:29.570
<v Speaker 2>just Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2315
01:51:29.950 --> 01:51:31.660
<v Speaker 2>They could have something because this </v>
<v Speaker 2>type of,</v>

2316
01:51:31.680 --> 01:51:32.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2317
01:51:32.001 --> 01:51:36.310
<v Speaker 2>the genitive adaptive generative </v>
<v Speaker 2>generative adversarial networks,</v>

2318
01:51:36.370 --> 01:51:38.860
<v Speaker 2>this thing where they got one judge in </v>
<v Speaker 2>one generator,</v>

2319
01:51:39.220 --> 01:51:44.220
<v Speaker 2>they'll have one ai that just tries to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make Joe Rogan's and then they'll have </v>

2320
01:51:44.220 --> 01:51:48.961
<v Speaker 2>another ai that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an expert at detecting the real Joe </v>

2321
01:51:48.961 --> 01:51:52.520
<v Speaker 2>Rogan and it'll have all this real </v>
<v Speaker 2>material to go by and then this will </v>

2322
01:51:52.520 --> 01:51:52.520
<v Speaker 2>keep feeding things at this and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2323
01:51:52.520 --> 01:51:54.160
<v Speaker 2>that's not quite right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't say like that.</v>

2324
01:51:54.161 --> 01:51:56.780
<v Speaker 2>He narrows his eyes when he's confused </v>
<v Speaker 2>and wow.</v>

2325
01:51:57.370 --> 01:51:59.170
<v Speaker 2>And eventually it will</v>

2326
01:51:59.350 --> 01:52:02.110
<v Speaker 3>come up with something that resembles </v>
<v Speaker 3>you will.</v>

2327
01:52:02.111 --> 01:52:07.111
<v Speaker 3>Then it becomes a thing of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you know you're you and how do </v>

2328
01:52:08.021 --> 01:52:11.290
<v Speaker 3>you know you're talking to someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's them.</v>

2329
01:52:11.590 --> 01:52:12.670
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's the thing.</v>

2330
01:52:13.630 --> 01:52:18.630
<v Speaker 3>Let's just say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why'd you leave this rubber Dick to </v>

2331
01:52:18.630 --> 01:52:18.630
<v Speaker 3>sitting right here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rude.</v>

2332
01:52:20.210 --> 01:52:21.970
<v Speaker 3>Chris Ryan gave me a rubber Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>

2333
01:52:22.420 --> 01:52:23.740
<v Speaker 3>I just noticed it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I looked over,</v>

2334
01:52:23.840 --> 01:52:25.810
<v Speaker 3>had a comment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say,</v>

2335
01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:27.220
<v Speaker 3>let's say if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2336
01:52:27.580 --> 01:52:32.580
<v Speaker 3>say your father died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is one of Ray Kurzweil's big </v>

2337
01:52:32.580 --> 01:52:33.700
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His,</v>

2338
01:52:33.760 --> 01:52:37.870
<v Speaker 3>one of his primary motivations is to </v>
<v Speaker 3>recreate his father.</v>

2339
01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:43.200
<v Speaker 3>He lost his father when he was young and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he believes that through the advent of </v>

2340
01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:46.040
<v Speaker 3>artificial intelligence and through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>data that is collected</v>

2341
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:51.040
<v Speaker 1>to recordings of his father and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>images that one day he will literally be</v>

2342
01:52:51.141 --> 01:52:53.450
<v Speaker 1>able to communicate with his father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

2343
01:52:54.890 --> 01:52:59.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I do know that someone like Dunkin </v>

2344
01:52:59.890 --> 01:53:02.740
<v Speaker 1>save my friend Duncan died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's entirely possible that within the </v>

2345
01:53:02.740 --> 01:53:06.980
<v Speaker 1>next 50 years they're going to be able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to create a version of Duncan and Duncan</v>

2346
01:53:06.981 --> 01:53:08.140
<v Speaker 1>can come over and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hi,</v>

2347
01:53:08.580 --> 01:53:10.130
<v Speaker 1>I'm back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2348
01:53:10.460 --> 01:53:13.310
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was dead and I won't even know.</v>

2349
01:53:13.370 --> 01:53:16.430
<v Speaker 1>I won't know if it's really Duncan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've gotta watch this episode of Black</v>

2350
01:53:16.430 --> 01:53:17.410
<v Speaker 1>Mirror that okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't tell me.</v>

2351
01:53:17.820 --> 01:53:18.480
<v Speaker 1>Don't tell me,</v>

2352
01:53:19.750 --> 01:53:21.330
<v Speaker 6>but is it for to remember where I found </v>
<v Speaker 6>us,</v>

2353
01:53:21.331 --> 01:53:26.331
<v Speaker 6>I think it was an NPR episode of </v>
<v Speaker 6>might've been on radio lab thing called </v>

2354
01:53:26.331 --> 01:53:27.550
<v Speaker 6>dad bought.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This guy made literally a text.</v>

2355
01:53:27.580 --> 01:53:32.580
<v Speaker 6>He used all of his dad's past text </v>
<v Speaker 6>messages between himself and him and </v>

2356
01:53:32.580 --> 01:53:36.220
<v Speaker 6>then made a Ai Bot he could chat with.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think his brother can use it to.</v>

2357
01:53:36.610 --> 01:53:38.170
<v Speaker 6>They can just send generic messages </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

2358
01:53:38.171 --> 01:53:38.800
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how you doing?</v>

2359
01:53:38.801 --> 01:53:40.020
<v Speaker 6>And He sends something that he would </v>
<v Speaker 6>accept</v>

2360
01:53:40.120 --> 01:53:40.700
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

2361
01:53:40.710 --> 01:53:41.540
<v Speaker 1>your dad's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shut up,</v>

2362
01:53:41.541 --> 01:53:45.020
<v Speaker 1>faggot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He Dad just says shit to you.</v>

2363
01:53:45.030 --> 01:53:46.640
<v Speaker 1>A little pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're never gonna amount to nothing.</v>

2364
01:53:46.641 --> 01:53:47.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dad bod.</v>

2365
01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:50.400
<v Speaker 1>That's what your dad was like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't do that.</v>

2366
01:53:50.500 --> 01:53:53.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can probably tweak it a bit though.</v>

2367
01:53:53.880 --> 01:53:56.960
<v Speaker 1>Just asking to dilate down type of thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>is coming.</v>

2368
01:53:56.961 --> 01:54:00.680
<v Speaker 1>They're like text now and it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not like very good.</v>

2369
01:54:00.681 --> 01:54:02.330
<v Speaker 1>You'd be able to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a real person.</v>

2370
01:54:02.570 --> 01:54:05.540
<v Speaker 1>Did you like x Mokena?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2371
01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:07.100

<v Speaker 1>You never saw it?</v>

2372
01:54:07.190 --> 01:54:09.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did see it,</v>

2373
01:54:09.860 --> 01:54:11.470
<v Speaker 1>but I've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget.</v>

2374
01:54:11.620 --> 01:54:12.980
<v Speaker 1>I forget very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very quickly.</v>

2375
01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:16.760
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it was a plot real quick.</v>

2376
01:54:16.790 --> 01:54:18.950
<v Speaker 1>The plot was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was like some,</v>

2377
01:54:20.940 --> 01:54:24.840
<v Speaker 1>some wishes in a house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super scientists who lived in the middle</v>

2378
01:54:24.840 --> 01:54:29.840
<v Speaker 1>of nowhere and they'd be flown into him </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he had created that guy right there </v>

2379
01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:32.510
<v Speaker 1>creating artificial intelligence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then went over the turing test and </v>

2380
01:54:32.510 --> 01:54:32.510
<v Speaker 1>everything in that too.</v>

2381
01:54:32.510 --> 01:54:32.510
<v Speaker 1>It's my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my favorite movies.</v>

2382
01:54:32.510 --> 01:54:34.760
<v Speaker 1>That's my top 10 favorite movies of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

2383
01:54:35.240 --> 01:54:38.780
<v Speaker 1>It hits so close to home and they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>so little cut the shit in that movie.</v>

2384
01:54:39.050 --> 01:54:44.050
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I described movies based on the cut the </v>

2385
01:54:44.050 --> 01:54:44.050
<v Speaker 1>shit scenes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like someone who was like,</v>

2386
01:54:44.050 --> 01:54:46.160
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck is she cut the shit.</v>

2387
01:54:46.190 --> 01:54:51.190
<v Speaker 1>How the hell did that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was none of that in that movie to </v>

2388
01:54:51.190 --> 01:54:51.190
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That in that movie to me was like,</v>

2389
01:54:51.190 --> 01:54:52.100
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>

2390
01:54:52.130 --> 01:54:53.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this all could take place.</v>

2391
01:54:53.940 --> 01:54:56.660
<v Speaker 1>It's paid there with these future robot </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

2392
01:54:56.770 --> 01:54:59.930
<v Speaker 1>So much of it is just trying to make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>robot that just like a human.</v>

2393
01:55:00.590 --> 01:55:03.800
<v Speaker 1>When the robots are not going to be like</v>
<v Speaker 1>humans,</v>

2394
01:55:03.850 --> 01:55:05.210
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>silence is going to be,</v>

2395
01:55:05.230 --> 01:55:10.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than humans at your command rooms </v>

2396
01:55:10.230 --> 01:55:11.030
<v Speaker 1>doing work that I'm going to look like </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans because it's not very practical.</v>

2397
01:55:11.031 --> 01:55:13.100
<v Speaker 1>There will be robots that look exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>like humans,</v>

2398
01:55:13.101 --> 01:55:18.101
<v Speaker 1>but that's just one aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be all kinds of much </v>

2399
01:55:18.101 --> 01:55:19.910
<v Speaker 1>more impressive robots I think of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>tomato robot.</v>

2400
01:55:20.050 --> 01:55:20.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's knocking.</v>

2401
01:55:20.871 --> 01:55:23.420
<v Speaker 1>It didn't have to look like a person </v>
<v Speaker 1>just has to be functioning the way it to</v>

2402
01:55:23.421 --> 01:55:24.560
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For it to be functional.</v>

2403
01:55:24.561 --> 01:55:26.450
<v Speaker 1>It's not to look like a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2404
01:55:26.560 --> 01:55:29.720
<v Speaker 1>It's to have these multiple fingers that</v>
<v Speaker 1>can knock away these green tomatoes.</v>

2405
01:55:30.050 --> 01:55:30.830
<v Speaker 1>So why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why,</v>

2406
01:55:31.460 --> 01:55:33.770
<v Speaker 1>why build something around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>limitations of the human body.</v>

2407
01:55:33.820 --> 01:55:36.190
<v Speaker 6>This is the same guy that isn't that </v>
<v Speaker 6>black mirror.</v>

2408
01:55:36.191 --> 01:55:36.850
<v Speaker 6>Episode two.</v>

2409
01:55:37.220 --> 01:55:38.750
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>

2410
01:55:38.950 --> 01:55:40.400
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2411
01:55:40.480 --> 01:55:44.040
<v Speaker 1>do you think they're gonna do a reboot </v>
<v Speaker 1>or a sequel to</v>

2412
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:47.340
<v Speaker 3>x Mokena?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd heard they were going to.</v>

2413
01:55:48.300 --> 01:55:49.050
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why wouldn't.</v>

2414
01:55:49.051 --> 01:55:50.670
<v Speaker 3>I mean why wait man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking made it better.</v>

2415
01:55:50.671 --> 01:55:55.671
<v Speaker 3>It was a really good movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>made a bunch of money and it was </v>

2416
01:55:55.671 --> 01:55:55.671
<v Speaker 3>amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They better.</v>

2417
01:55:55.671 --> 01:55:56.550
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am worried about that.</v>

2418
01:55:56.610 --> 01:56:01.610
<v Speaker 3>I am worried and I'm also worried that </v>
<v Speaker 3>by the fact that guys like Elon Musk are</v>

2419
01:56:01.651 --> 01:56:06.651
<v Speaker 3>worried that when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when someone like that worries and he </v>

2420
01:56:06.651 --> 01:56:06.651
<v Speaker 3>starts talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

2421
01:56:06.651 --> 01:56:08.880
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who is paying attention to this?</v>

2422
01:56:09.210 --> 01:56:14.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many people are really at the </v>

2423
01:56:14.210 --> 01:56:14.210
<v Speaker 3>forefront?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And is it possible to pull that back?</v>

2424
01:56:14.210 --> 01:56:17.871
<v Speaker 3>Because I'm aware of what the United </v>
<v Speaker 3>States is up to in terms of like what </v>

2425
01:56:17.871 --> 01:56:18.870
<v Speaker 3>gets printed to the news.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously I'm not really aware,</v>

2426
01:56:19.350 --> 01:56:22.710
<v Speaker 3>but when you get further than that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like China,</v>

2427
01:56:22.770 --> 01:56:23.910
<v Speaker 3>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we don't,</v>

2428
01:56:23.911 --> 01:56:24.960
<v Speaker 3>we have no idea what they're doing.</v>

2429
01:56:25.090 --> 01:56:30.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they must be doing this type of </v>

2430
01:56:30.090 --> 01:56:30.090
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They must be.</v>

2431
01:56:30.090 --> 01:56:30.090
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will.</v>

2432
01:56:30.090 --> 01:56:30.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those things,</v>

2433
01:56:30.810 --> 01:56:34.390
<v Speaker 2>something they don't need this huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a physical infrastructure,</v>

2434
01:56:34.460 --> 01:56:38.650
<v Speaker 2>like they don't need a big military or </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything to do cyber warfare with Ai.</v>

2435
01:56:39.160 --> 01:56:44.160
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they could be developing all this </v>

2436
01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:46.051
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligence to do things </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a infiltrate everybody's social </v>

2437
01:56:46.301 --> 01:56:47.890
<v Speaker 2>media and make them vote for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference</v>

2438
01:56:47.930 --> 01:56:52.910
<v Speaker 3>guy or just infiltrate all our power </v>
<v Speaker 3>stations and they shut them all down.</v>

2439
01:56:52.970 --> 01:56:55.540
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the real problems that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>have today with,</v>

2440
01:56:55.541 --> 01:57:00.541
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the conversations regarding politics </v>

2441
01:57:00.541 --> 01:57:04.300
<v Speaker 3>regarding whether or not Russia hacked </v>
<v Speaker 3>the election is because people are so </v>

2442
01:57:04.300 --> 01:57:08.920
<v Speaker 3>concerned with painting out their party </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be innocent and the other party to be</v>

2443
01:57:09.891 --> 01:57:14.891
<v Speaker 3>guilty and describing all the different </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that the Russians did and the </v>

2444
01:57:14.901 --> 01:57:17.640
<v Speaker 3>interference and all of the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2445
01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:21.140
<v Speaker 3>the subterfuge it's being used that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were,</v>

2446
01:57:21.350 --> 01:57:26.350
<v Speaker 3>I think we're missing out on this idea </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you can electronically affect the </v>

2447
01:57:27.561 --> 01:57:32.561
<v Speaker 3>way people think about things if you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have enough resources to attack an idea </v>

2448
01:57:36.170 --> 01:57:41.170
<v Speaker 3>with propaganda through bots and this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>something that you see all the time.</v>

2449
01:57:41.760 --> 01:57:46.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of the stuff that Russia did was </v>

2450
01:57:46.760 --> 01:57:49.341
<v Speaker 2>posted in closed groups on facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's something that you really </v>

2451
01:57:50.581 --> 01:57:55.581
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be able to see happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you have to be a part of the </v>

2452
01:57:55.581 --> 01:57:55.581
<v Speaker 2>group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those traits.</v>

2453
01:57:55.620 --> 01:57:57.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They joined these groups,</v>

2454
01:57:57.580 --> 01:57:58.310
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they,</v>

2455
01:57:58.320 --> 01:58:00.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have not bought some birch,</v>

2456
01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:01.070
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2457
01:58:02.680 --> 01:58:07.680
<v Speaker 2>they had these sweatshops where all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people are typing away doing all </v>

2458
01:58:07.680 --> 01:58:10.851
<v Speaker 2>kinds of stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pushing out these stories and they go </v>

2459
01:58:10.851 --> 01:58:14.361
<v Speaker 2>into these closed groups because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>harder for people to figure out what's </v>

2460
01:58:14.361 --> 01:58:16.590
<v Speaker 2>going on if you're in a closed group and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they post all this stuff,</v>

2461
01:58:16.860 --> 01:58:17.310
<v Speaker 2>all these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2462
01:58:17.450 --> 01:58:22.450
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anti Hillary memes or whatever pro </v>

2463
01:58:22.450 --> 01:58:25.860
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump like pro Bernie to push a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain narrative.</v>

2464
01:58:26.160 --> 01:58:31.160
<v Speaker 2>One of them where the guy got busted </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he accidentally hat on is </v>

2465
01:58:31.160 --> 01:58:33.210
<v Speaker 2>location and showed that he was in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia and uh,</v>

2466
01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:33.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's</v>

2467
01:58:34.350 --> 01:58:39.350
<v Speaker 3>some guy with a make Hashtag Maga,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an American flag and his avatar and the </v>

2468
01:58:41.051 --> 01:58:41.850
<v Speaker 3>whole deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2469
01:58:41.851 --> 01:58:42.030
<v Speaker 3>It's going</v>

2470
01:58:42.030 --> 01:58:44.680
<v Speaker 1>to be really hard to figure out exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>what happened.</v>

2471
01:58:44.920 --> 01:58:49.920
<v Speaker 1>That it's gonna be even harder in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future though because we will be </v>

2472
01:58:49.920 --> 01:58:50.170
<v Speaker 1>covering the tracks a lot better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The learning.</v>

2473
01:58:50.470 --> 01:58:51.820
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what works,</v>

2474
01:58:52.030 --> 01:58:57.030
<v Speaker 1>but it's really hard to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's real and what's not real right </v>

2475
01:58:57.030 --> 01:58:57.030
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2476
01:58:57.030 --> 01:58:59.920
<v Speaker 1>You don't remember wag the dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was that like 20 years ago and that</v>

2477
01:58:59.921 --> 01:59:03.640
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they described the possibility of faking</v>

2478
01:59:03.641 --> 01:59:08.641
<v Speaker 1>these conflicts and having this fake </v>
<v Speaker 1>video and having movie directors film </v>

2479
01:59:08.641 --> 01:59:11.680
<v Speaker 1>everything and that would influence the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way people thought about world conflicts</v>

2480
01:59:11.790 --> 01:59:14.100
<v Speaker 1>and now we're getting to a stage where </v>
<v Speaker 1>that technology is a lot more,</v>

2481
01:59:14.130 --> 01:59:16.840
<v Speaker 1>a little more realistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>faking videos.</v>

2482
01:59:16.990 --> 01:59:21.990
<v Speaker 1>You were pretty close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are things where you can take </v>

2483
01:59:21.990 --> 01:59:24.481
<v Speaker 1>audio now and just basically sample </v>
<v Speaker 1>audio and create anything that person </v>

2484
01:59:25.121 --> 01:59:25.990
<v Speaker 1>might say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2485
01:59:25.991 --> 01:59:30.760
<v Speaker 1>that was a radiolab podcast where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>did it and it's still a little crude,</v>

2486
01:59:30.761 --> 01:59:35.761
<v Speaker 1>but like most things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you go back to the very first </v>

2487
01:59:35.761 --> 01:59:39.721
<v Speaker 1>oculus rift,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was only a few years ago and it </v>

2488
01:59:39.721 --> 01:59:43.201
<v Speaker 1>was a pixilated and clunky looking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you look at the htc vive now </v>

2489
01:59:43.420 --> 01:59:46.360
<v Speaker 1>they're virtual reality's pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>spectacular.</v>

2490
01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:49.930
<v Speaker 1>You could still tell that it's not real,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>

2491
01:59:49.931 --> 01:59:51.640
<v Speaker 1>the experience is so much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>immersive.</v>

2492
01:59:51.730 --> 01:59:56.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember reading a book back in the </v>

2493
01:59:56.730 --> 01:59:58.351
<v Speaker 1>nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's less than zero by Brett </v>

2494
01:59:58.351 --> 01:59:58.351
<v Speaker 1>Easton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ellis.</v>

2495
01:59:58.351 --> 01:59:58.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is seen in that way.</v>

2496
01:59:58.511 --> 02:00:03.511
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they map somebodies face onto like a </v>

2497
02:00:03.511 --> 02:00:04.660
<v Speaker 1>pulling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pulling back to a,</v>

2498
02:00:04.720 --> 02:00:07.960
<v Speaker 1>and at the time I thought that was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most ridiculously stupid thing I've ever</v>

2499
02:00:07.961 --> 02:00:12.961
<v Speaker 1>heard of because they would never </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly work and there's no way of </v>

2500
02:00:12.961 --> 02:00:15.331
<v Speaker 1>getting that degree of accuracy and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got an app in my iphone that </v>

2501
02:00:15.331 --> 02:00:19.531
<v Speaker 1>actually does it to a reasonable degree </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's quite hard sometimes to see </v>

2502
02:00:20.111 --> 02:00:22.120
<v Speaker 1>what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this thing called um,</v>

2503
02:00:22.310 --> 02:00:26.500
<v Speaker 1>mugged life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just a toy app where you take a</v>

2504
02:00:26.501 --> 02:00:31.501
<v Speaker 1>picture of yourself and instantly like </v>
<v Speaker 1>mapsys onto a three d face and you can </v>

2505
02:00:31.501 --> 02:00:32.980
<v Speaker 1>do all these expressions and you can say</v>
<v Speaker 1>these things.</v>

2506
02:00:32.980 --> 02:00:37.980
<v Speaker 1>He can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has these like meme generators and </v>

2507
02:00:37.980 --> 02:00:38.600
<v Speaker 1>it's basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2508
02:00:38.650 --> 02:00:40.870
<v Speaker 1>it's that type of thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I thought was ridiculous.</v>

2509
02:00:40.871 --> 02:00:43.810
<v Speaker 1>Speculation like 20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now it's come to pass.</v>

2510
02:00:43.900 --> 02:00:48.490
<v Speaker 1>While there is an article that I tweeted</v>
<v Speaker 1>today about Gal Godot,</v>

2511
02:00:48.730 --> 02:00:51.940
<v Speaker 1>who is the woman from wonder woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've take,</v>

2512
02:00:51.970 --> 02:00:55.720
<v Speaker 1>they use an algorithm and they tape her </v>
<v Speaker 1>face onto a porn video.</v>

2513
02:00:55.780 --> 02:00:58.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have her doing porn and it looks</v>

2514
02:00:58.720 --> 02:01:03.720
<v Speaker 1>just like her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can kind of tell a little bit that </v>

2515
02:01:03.720 --> 02:01:04.330
<v Speaker 1>it's not her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not much.</v>

2516
02:01:04.720 --> 02:01:07.210
<v Speaker 1>It's enough where you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

2517
02:01:07.390 --> 02:01:12.390
<v Speaker 1>they're going to get really good at this</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there'll be able to have you </v>

2518
02:01:12.390 --> 02:01:12.460
<v Speaker 1>doing anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could be a murderer,</v>

2519
02:01:12.461 --> 02:01:16.590
<v Speaker 1>they can have you outside murdering </v>
<v Speaker 1>people and they put that in the news and</v>

2520
02:01:16.600 --> 02:01:19.050
<v Speaker 1>then by the time they retract it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2521
02:01:19.390 --> 02:01:21.400
<v Speaker 1>and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll make west wasn't really out there.</v>

2522
02:01:21.670 --> 02:01:23.800
<v Speaker 1>Just gunning people down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was someone else.</v>

2523
02:01:23.801 --> 02:01:26.290
<v Speaker 1>Your neighbors don't trust you anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to move.</v>

2524
02:01:26.291 --> 02:01:28.030
<v Speaker 1>The damage is done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2525
02:01:28.031 --> 02:01:33.031
<v Speaker 1>and that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that I support like the fucking </v>

2526
02:01:33.460 --> 02:01:38.460
<v Speaker 1>hysterics and the craziness that trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>tweets and all the different shit that </v>

2527
02:01:38.460 --> 02:01:39.860
<v Speaker 1>he tweets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but occasionally they get things wrong</v>

2528
02:01:40.130 --> 02:01:41.900
<v Speaker 3>and they make stories about him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2529
02:01:42.180 --> 02:01:44.570
<v Speaker 3>like the CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia story where they had a fire.</v>

2530
02:01:44.571 --> 02:01:46.500
<v Speaker 3>Those three.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2531
02:01:46.820 --> 02:01:49.550
<v Speaker 3>Well when they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after they had fired those reporters who</v>

2532
02:01:49.551 --> 02:01:54.290
<v Speaker 3>had made these erroneous connections and</v>
<v Speaker 3>had this like a flaw written piece,</v>

2533
02:01:54.830 --> 02:01:59.830
<v Speaker 3>they fired them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the story has already been written </v>

2534
02:01:59.830 --> 02:02:02.120
<v Speaker 3>like this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess there's a rush to get things out</v>

2535
02:02:02.121 --> 02:02:07.121
<v Speaker 3>there and they're trying very hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you've got to be very careful </v>

2536
02:02:07.121 --> 02:02:08.810
<v Speaker 3>because once something's out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that initial thing of being out there is</v>

2537
02:02:08.811 --> 02:02:10.760
<v Speaker 3>so much more powerful than any </v>
<v Speaker 3>retraction.</v>

2538
02:02:10.840 --> 02:02:15.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really hard to get retractions out </v>

2539
02:02:15.840 --> 02:02:16.630
<v Speaker 2>because the original thing just goes so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much more than the retraction.</v>

2540
02:02:16.900 --> 02:02:21.710
<v Speaker 2>Especially if it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really more thing going on right now.</v>

2541
02:02:21.800 --> 02:02:25.750
<v Speaker 2>The election today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a thing where they said that his</v>

2542
02:02:25.751 --> 02:02:30.751
<v Speaker 2>signature was fake because the ink on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the image was like black on one side and</v>

2543
02:02:30.791 --> 02:02:32.860
<v Speaker 2>blue on the other side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they said,</v>

2544
02:02:32.861 --> 02:02:37.861
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this must have been faked because this </v>

2545
02:02:37.861 --> 02:02:38.050
<v Speaker 2>half of the Roy is black and the more </v>
<v Speaker 2>blue.</v>

2546
02:02:38.051 --> 02:02:43.051
<v Speaker 2>So I was looking into that and I did </v>
<v Speaker 2>some experiments where I did a signature</v>

2547
02:02:44.171 --> 02:02:46.270
<v Speaker 2>and then held it at an angle and took </v>
<v Speaker 2>photos of it.</v>

2548
02:02:46.271 --> 02:02:51.271
<v Speaker 2>And I found out that this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this type of chromatic aberration from </v>

2549
02:02:51.271 --> 02:02:54.841
<v Speaker 2>the camera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which just does that with ink and it's </v>

2550
02:02:54.841 --> 02:02:56.620
<v Speaker 2>very easy to duplicate and you can show </v>
<v Speaker 2>that this was actually what was going on</v>

2551
02:02:56.860 --> 02:02:58.810
<v Speaker 2>in his image,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you can look at other images of</v>

2552
02:02:58.811 --> 02:03:01.900
<v Speaker 2>the signature from different angles </v>
<v Speaker 2>which show that it's all black.</v>

2553
02:03:02.290 --> 02:03:07.290
<v Speaker 2>So those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's one image on CNN that she had </v>

2554
02:03:07.290 --> 02:03:07.290
<v Speaker 2>this blue and black ink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2555
02:03:07.290 --> 02:03:10.960
<v Speaker 2>then I figured out that it was just this</v>
<v Speaker 2>trick of the camera,</v>

2556
02:03:11.770 --> 02:03:16.050
<v Speaker 2>but even though it's been debunked and </v>
<v Speaker 2>explained this,</v>

2557
02:03:16.210 --> 02:03:18.580
<v Speaker 2>people are still spreading the exact </v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing around.</v>

2558
02:03:18.780 --> 02:03:20.530
<v Speaker 2>So that's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that can be a problem.</v>

2559
02:03:20.531 --> 02:03:21.700
<v Speaker 2>It could swing the election.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2560
02:03:21.710 --> 02:03:23.530
<v Speaker 2>And it's time limited,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that type of thing.</v>

2561
02:03:23.560 --> 02:03:23.930
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2562
02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:25.430
<v Speaker 2>it's done today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after today.</v>

2563
02:03:25.440 --> 02:03:26.140
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really matter.</v>

2564
02:03:26.200 --> 02:03:31.000
<v Speaker 3>There was also something about him </v>
<v Speaker 3>writing something in someone's yearbook.</v>

2565
02:03:31.480 --> 02:03:33.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the book thing was the,</v>

2566
02:03:34.110 --> 02:03:39.110
<v Speaker 3>the thing was they said that the woman </v>
<v Speaker 3>had forged the entry to the yearbook,</v>

2567
02:03:39.190 --> 02:03:44.190
<v Speaker 3>but that's not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What she had done was written the date </v>

2568
02:03:44.680 --> 02:03:47.410
<v Speaker 3>of the note,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the old hickory house.</v>

2569
02:03:48.280 --> 02:03:50.020
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she didn't,</v>

2570
02:03:50.080 --> 02:03:53.620
<v Speaker 3>didn't forge the actual words she is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's a.</v>

2571
02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:58.680
<v Speaker 3>that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is that she did do it and </v>

2572
02:03:58.680 --> 02:03:58.680
<v Speaker 3>she didn't say she did it.</v>

2573
02:03:58.680 --> 02:04:00.230
<v Speaker 2>There's so many people want that to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>true,</v>

2574
02:04:00.231 --> 02:04:05.231
<v Speaker 2>that it was forged.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That if you can take something that's </v>

2575
02:04:05.231 --> 02:04:05.680
<v Speaker 2>like slightly problematic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like her,</v>

2576
02:04:05.681 --> 02:04:10.681
<v Speaker 2>like not saying that she actually added </v>
<v Speaker 2>this annotation afterwards and then you </v>

2577
02:04:10.681 --> 02:04:13.640
<v Speaker 2>can say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that she admitted to it being forged,</v>

2578
02:04:14.180 --> 02:04:17.080
<v Speaker 2>which is basically a lie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

2579
02:04:17.150 --> 02:04:20.390
<v Speaker 2>it will stick for long enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really matter that it's a lie</v>

2580
02:04:20.391 --> 02:04:21.290
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

2581
02:04:21.660 --> 02:04:26.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the end of the day today he doesn't </v>

2582
02:04:26.660 --> 02:04:27.110
<v Speaker 2>really matter at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So only had to do was get this story out</v>

2583
02:04:27.111 --> 02:04:32.111
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had enough stuff in it to make it </v>

2584
02:04:32.111 --> 02:04:32.230
<v Speaker 2>seem vaguely plausible to people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to believe that she,</v>

2585
02:04:32.300 --> 02:04:33.110
<v Speaker 2>she fortunate.</v>

2586
02:04:33.210 --> 02:04:37.950
<v Speaker 3>Did she forged the date and did she try </v>
<v Speaker 3>to say that that date was</v>

2587
02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:40.290
<v Speaker 1>written by him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

2588
02:04:40.530 --> 02:04:42.330
<v Speaker 1>I didn't note underneath it had the </v>
<v Speaker 1>date,</v>

2589
02:04:42.390 --> 02:04:44.220
<v Speaker 1>but he had also written on the date </v>
<v Speaker 1>above.</v>

2590
02:04:44.790 --> 02:04:45.540
<v Speaker 1>He wrote like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2591
02:04:45.570 --> 02:04:47.240
<v Speaker 1>to a sweeter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more darling girl,</v>

2592
02:04:47.250 --> 02:04:50.070
<v Speaker 1>I could never say merry Christmas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roy Moore,</v>

2593
02:04:50.071 --> 02:04:54.120
<v Speaker 1>77 and then underneath she addressed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2594
02:04:54.840 --> 02:04:57.000
<v Speaker 1>old hickory house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1977.</v>

2595
02:04:57.630 --> 02:05:00.660
<v Speaker 1>And did she try to claim that he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>written that originally?</v>

2596
02:05:00.661 --> 02:05:03.480
<v Speaker 1>It seemed like she was saying that he'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>written the whole thing.</v>

2597
02:05:03.650 --> 02:05:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2598
02:05:04.801 --> 02:05:05.910
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And she,</v>

2599
02:05:05.911 --> 02:05:07.890
<v Speaker 1>she read out the inscription and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

2600
02:05:07.940 --> 02:05:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Roy Moore wrote this in my book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blah,</v>

2601
02:05:09.781 --> 02:05:10.050
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

2602
02:05:10.051 --> 02:05:10.380
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah.</v>

2603
02:05:10.381 --> 02:05:15.381
<v Speaker 1>And she'd read the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the annotation at the end of the </v>

2604
02:05:15.381 --> 02:05:15.480
<v Speaker 1>annotation at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Recent?</v>

2605
02:05:15.960 --> 02:05:16.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing.</v>

2606
02:05:16.950 --> 02:05:18.660
<v Speaker 1>I think she said she wrote it like </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards,</v>

2607
02:05:18.661 --> 02:05:20.460
<v Speaker 1>like you have to shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2608
02:05:21.180 --> 02:05:23.190
<v Speaker 1>the same day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2609
02:05:23.191 --> 02:05:28.191
<v Speaker 1>so how the fuck achieving remember how </v>
<v Speaker 1>do you remember what you wrote down in </v>

2610
02:05:28.191 --> 02:05:30.900
<v Speaker 1>1977 at that handwriting is a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>different between them.</v>

2611
02:05:30.900 --> 02:05:33.540
<v Speaker 1>So it was fairly obvious that it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same,</v>

2612
02:05:33.780 --> 02:05:37.320
<v Speaker 1>the same handwriting from stuff that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>like her today.</v>

2613
02:05:37.530 --> 02:05:42.530
<v Speaker 1>Trying to frame him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems more like she was just </v>

2614
02:05:42.530 --> 02:05:43.170
<v Speaker 1>documenting it at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for golf,</v>

2615
02:05:43.171 --> 02:05:44.880
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it makes it more realistic.</v>

2616
02:05:44.881 --> 02:05:47.180
<v Speaker 1>So if she was going to forge it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she would afford to.</v>

2617
02:05:47.181 --> 02:05:50.640
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing was she's talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>something for 40 years ago.</v>

2618
02:05:50.980 --> 02:05:51.470
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

2619
02:05:51.780 --> 02:05:52.980
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's this,</v>

2620
02:05:53.100 --> 02:05:58.100
<v Speaker 1>this whole thing of trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like someone's saying that this </v>

2621
02:05:58.111 --> 02:06:00.780
<v Speaker 1>definitely happened 40 years ago is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

2622
02:06:00.900 --> 02:06:05.900
<v Speaker 1>so bonkers to the hell could you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a real problem with the </v>

2623
02:06:06.151 --> 02:06:07.550
<v Speaker 1>news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2624
02:06:07.560 --> 02:06:10.830
<v Speaker 1>like one of the Al Franken accusers we </v>
<v Speaker 1>were talking about yesterday,</v>

2625
02:06:10.890 --> 02:06:13.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>claim that Al had grabbed her,</v>

2626
02:06:13.500 --> 02:06:18.500
<v Speaker 1>her waist and squoze her fat and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of way when she's talking about </v>

2627
02:06:18.500 --> 02:06:19.680
<v Speaker 1>something 10 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2628
02:06:19.681 --> 02:06:24.681
<v Speaker 1>you absolutely remember what happened in</v>
<v Speaker 1>something so inconsequential 10 years </v>

2629
02:06:25.021 --> 02:06:25.230
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

2630
02:06:25.230 --> 02:06:30.230
<v Speaker 1>That seems insane to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you add 30 years onto that and I'm </v>

2631
02:06:30.230 --> 02:06:30.300
<v Speaker 1>just calling bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2632
02:06:30.450 --> 02:06:35.450
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't really remember the level of </v>

2633
02:06:35.450 --> 02:06:35.450
<v Speaker 1>detail that a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2634
02:06:35.450 --> 02:06:38.130
<v Speaker 1>even if you would have to be something </v>
<v Speaker 1>really significant,</v>

2635
02:06:38.910 --> 02:06:41.280
<v Speaker 1>but even then you knew about creative </v>
<v Speaker 1>memories.</v>

2636
02:06:41.310 --> 02:06:43.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People's memories change over time.</v>

2637
02:06:43.320 --> 02:06:46.050
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people a claim,</v>

2638
02:06:46.051 --> 02:06:49.080
<v Speaker 1>they remember where they were when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>heard about the space shuttle blowing up</v>

2639
02:06:49.081 --> 02:06:50.400
<v Speaker 1>the first one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2640
02:06:50.401 --> 02:06:54.930
<v Speaker 1>The people have done extensive research </v>
<v Speaker 1>into that like tracking people's stories</v>

2641
02:06:54.931 --> 02:06:59.931
<v Speaker 1>over like a decade or so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they found that a significant </v>

2642
02:06:59.931 --> 02:07:02.040
<v Speaker 1>percentage of people change the store is</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 years later,</v>

2643
02:07:02.160 --> 02:07:07.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure asked about why they were so </v>
<v Speaker 1>like for something like harassment or </v>

2644
02:07:07.160 --> 02:07:12.141
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's entirely possible that the story </v>

2645
02:07:12.141 --> 02:07:12.141
<v Speaker 1>could change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't mean that it's false.</v>

2646
02:07:12.141 --> 02:07:16.730
<v Speaker 1>It's just possible that it could change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're there conveniently </v>

2647
02:07:16.730 --> 02:07:20.421
<v Speaker 1>forgetting or ignoring that human </v>
<v Speaker 1>memories insanely flawed and malleable </v>

2648
02:07:22.020 --> 02:07:27.020
<v Speaker 1>and I think part of why we have statute </v>
<v Speaker 1>of limitations because like things like </v>

2649
02:07:27.020 --> 02:07:29.100
<v Speaker 1>eyewitness testimony essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>degrades over time.</v>

2650
02:07:29.700 --> 02:07:34.700
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that I'm really</v>
<v Speaker 1>hoping is going to be cured with </v>

2651
02:07:34.700 --> 02:07:37.731
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm hoping we're going to give up our </v>

2652
02:07:37.731 --> 02:07:37.731
<v Speaker 1>bullshit</v>

2653
02:07:37.731 --> 02:07:41.290
<v Speaker 3>biological memory for a fat SD card.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They stick in the back of your head.</v>

2654
02:07:41.590 --> 02:07:46.590
<v Speaker 3>Just pop that sucker in there and look </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you'll have all of your memories </v>

2655
02:07:46.590 --> 02:07:48.170
<v Speaker 3>entirely accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a.</v>

2656
02:07:48.250 --> 02:07:52.180
<v Speaker 3>That was a black mirror episode says </v>
<v Speaker 3>motherfuckers are on top of everything.</v>

2657
02:07:52.181 --> 02:07:57.181
<v Speaker 3>They know everything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I really think that that's entirely </v>

2658
02:07:57.181 --> 02:07:59.431
<v Speaker 3>possible in the future that there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be some way we have a neural </v>

2659
02:07:59.431 --> 02:08:01.630
<v Speaker 3>interface with some sort of recording </v>
<v Speaker 3>device.</v>

2660
02:08:01.631 --> 02:08:05.500
<v Speaker 3>It's far more accurate and that we'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>all agree to it.</v>

2661
02:08:05.710 --> 02:08:08.080
<v Speaker 3>We'll all agree to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just like photographs,</v>

2662
02:08:08.110 --> 02:08:13.110
<v Speaker 3>like if Jamie is standing next to you </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I say Jamie and Mick West,</v>

2663
02:08:13.961 --> 02:08:15.310
<v Speaker 3>we're in the room together and take a </v>
<v Speaker 3>picture.</v>

2664
02:08:15.700 --> 02:08:18.880
<v Speaker 3>It used to be that I could say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well that's definite because I have this</v>

2665
02:08:18.881 --> 02:08:22.180
<v Speaker 3>photo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now with photoshop and video editing</v>

2666
02:08:22.181 --> 02:08:24.310
<v Speaker 3>tools,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so even then,</v>

2667
02:08:24.340 --> 02:08:26.200
<v Speaker 3>so what am I talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because even in your memory,</v>

2668
02:08:26.210 --> 02:08:29.090
<v Speaker 2>these are going to go create our visual </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence,</v>

2669
02:08:29.720 --> 02:08:31.370
<v Speaker 2>brightening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>creating memories for you.</v>

2670
02:08:31.450 --> 02:08:33.490
<v Speaker 3>Well there wasn't that like a total </v>
<v Speaker 3>recall,</v>

2671
02:08:33.550 --> 02:08:35.530
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't that part of the idea of total</v>

2672
02:08:35.531 --> 02:08:40.531
<v Speaker 3>recall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They could put you put like fake </v>

2673
02:08:40.531 --> 02:08:42.760
<v Speaker 3>memories in your brain and have you have</v>
<v Speaker 3>fake experiences.</v>

2674
02:08:43.270 --> 02:08:48.270
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of experiences that I had </v>
<v Speaker 3>that award gigantic to me like all of my</v>

2675
02:08:48.821 --> 02:08:53.821
<v Speaker 3>years of martial arts competition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you had asked me to like accurately </v>

2676
02:08:54.820 --> 02:08:59.820
<v Speaker 3>depict some of the most significant </v>
<v Speaker 3>memories of my life from age 16 to 21,</v>

2677
02:09:01.660 --> 02:09:03.520
<v Speaker 3>like all those martial arts fights that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I had,</v>

2678
02:09:03.700 --> 02:09:05.800
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't even be able to touch it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have,</v>

2679
02:09:06.460 --> 02:09:08.410
<v Speaker 3>I've zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've scrapped.</v>

2680
02:09:08.450 --> 02:09:10.030
<v Speaker 3>I've like flashes.</v>

2681
02:09:10.140 --> 02:09:15.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was starting to figure out all this </v>

2682
02:09:15.140 --> 02:09:16.601
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't never soft when I was working </v>

2683
02:09:16.601 --> 02:09:16.601
<v Speaker 2>on Sandy Hook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I just got interviewed for the,</v>

2684
02:09:16.601 --> 02:09:21.030
<v Speaker 2>doing a documentary about the making </v>
<v Speaker 2>well about the history of Neversoft and </v>

2685
02:09:21.030 --> 02:09:22.350
<v Speaker 2>Tony Hawk and the guy's interviewing me </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm like,</v>

2686
02:09:22.650 --> 02:09:25.920
<v Speaker 2>I kind of remember it was like somebody </v>
<v Speaker 2>is like 20 years ago,</v>

2687
02:09:26.070 --> 02:09:31.070
<v Speaker 2>but it's that type of thing that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought I would never forget that </v>

2688
02:09:31.070 --> 02:09:32.820
<v Speaker 2>because it was such a significant part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of my life,</v>

2689
02:09:32.850 --> 02:09:35.520
<v Speaker 2>but it's just kind of dropping away over</v>
<v Speaker 2>the years.</v>

2690
02:09:36.030 --> 02:09:37.740
<v Speaker 2>Anything that happens a lot with the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2691
02:09:37.890 --> 02:09:42.890
<v Speaker 2>people are looking back on nine slash 11</v>
<v Speaker 2>and going by the memories of what </v>

2692
02:09:42.890 --> 02:09:45.600
<v Speaker 2>happened that day and it changes your </v>
<v Speaker 2>memory changes.</v>

2693
02:09:45.780 --> 02:09:46.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will,</v>

2694
02:09:46.310 --> 02:09:51.310
<v Speaker 3>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a few things that I remember </v>

2695
02:09:51.310 --> 02:09:51.310
<v Speaker 3>because there like some significance to </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2696
02:09:51.510 --> 02:09:56.510
<v Speaker 3>Like I remember the space shuttle thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I was over at an ex girlfriend's</v>

2697
02:09:57.061 --> 02:10:02.061
<v Speaker 3>house and it was one of the few times </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we saw each other before we had </v>

2698
02:10:02.061 --> 02:10:04.680
<v Speaker 3>completely stopped seeing each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we had kind of broken up and then I</v>

2699
02:10:04.710 --> 02:10:08.370
<v Speaker 3>drove out to her house to visit her and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then while I was over at house,</v>

2700
02:10:08.371 --> 02:10:09.960
<v Speaker 3>we saw the launch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were like,</v>

2701
02:10:09.961 --> 02:10:11.220
<v Speaker 3>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

2702
02:10:11.240 --> 02:10:12.480
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we actually saw the</v>

2703
02:10:12.740 --> 02:10:15.800
<v Speaker 2>play of it blowing up and were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

2704
02:10:15.860 --> 02:10:19.040
<v Speaker 2>like this is fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See some people say that replay and then</v>

2705
02:10:19.041 --> 02:10:21.290
<v Speaker 2>they remember that to seeing the actual </v>
<v Speaker 2>event,</v>

2706
02:10:21.340 --> 02:10:23.810
<v Speaker 2>so why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so they think they saw right live.</v>

2707
02:10:24.100 --> 02:10:25.190
<v Speaker 2>So that becomes a memory.</v>

2708
02:10:25.340 --> 02:10:27.920
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty good at that.</v>

2709
02:10:28.040 --> 02:10:33.040
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty good at going over my </v>

2710
02:10:33.040 --> 02:10:33.040
<v Speaker 3>memories to make sure that I'm thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2711
02:10:33.040 --> 02:10:33.970
<v Speaker 3>you think maybe you're not.</v>

2712
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:36.290
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you shouldn't go back and check </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these memories of Tom,</v>

2713
02:10:36.330 --> 02:10:39.800
<v Speaker 1>Tom and your ex girlfriend and asked her</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that really happened.</v>

2714
02:10:39.890 --> 02:10:43.070
<v Speaker 1>I remember very clearly where I was when</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam Kennison died.</v>

2715
02:10:44.430 --> 02:10:46.910
<v Speaker 1>I remember definitely where I was when </v>
<v Speaker 1>nine slash 11 happened.</v>

2716
02:10:47.130 --> 02:10:52.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I got some calls from friends </v>

2717
02:10:52.130 --> 02:10:54.220
<v Speaker 1>and they woke me up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My phone kept ringing and I remember </v>

2718
02:10:54.220 --> 02:10:54.220
<v Speaker 1>that because I remember being in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

2719
02:10:54.220 --> 02:10:56.780
<v Speaker 1>I remember turning on the TV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's 100 percent.</v>

2720
02:10:56.870 --> 02:10:58.640
<v Speaker 2>I was driving to work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on the floor of five,</v>

2721
02:10:58.850 --> 02:11:01.280
<v Speaker 2>so I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to be very solidly,</v>

2722
02:11:01.310 --> 02:11:04.550
<v Speaker 2>but seems there are details around that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I remember I went to,</v>

2723
02:11:05.000 --> 02:11:10.000
<v Speaker 2>I went to Taco bell on the way to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>some food because I thought it might be </v>

2724
02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:12.630
<v Speaker 2>a long day now as the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much is enough to get dental care.</v>

2725
02:11:12.650 --> 02:11:17.650
<v Speaker 2>Remember now I went to a gas station.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I went to Taco Bell.</v>

2726
02:11:18.970 --> 02:11:21.200
<v Speaker 2>Dang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm starting to forget what happened</v>

2727
02:11:21.201 --> 02:11:23.180
<v Speaker 2>on nine slash 11.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember the day</v>

2728
02:11:23.250 --> 02:11:28.250
<v Speaker 1>because I spent it with uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eddie and Joey Diaz and a couple other </v>

2729
02:11:28.250 --> 02:11:29.530
<v Speaker 1>friends of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went to the,</v>

2730
02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:34.960
<v Speaker 1>went to a burrito joint on sunset in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood and we were just talking about</v>

2731
02:11:37.271 --> 02:11:42.271
<v Speaker 1>how there's no flights like look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we'd heard that the flight tend </v>

2732
02:11:42.271 --> 02:11:42.271
<v Speaker 1>to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look man,</v>

2733
02:11:42.271 --> 02:11:42.630
<v Speaker 1>you see a plane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy's weird.</v>

2734
02:11:43.110 --> 02:11:45.630
<v Speaker 1>It felt weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We felt like we're stuck in California.</v>

2735
02:11:46.070 --> 02:11:51.070
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the freedom of air travels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that if you don't fly a </v>

2736
02:11:51.070 --> 02:11:51.900
<v Speaker 1>lot you don't think about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you,</v>

2737
02:11:51.990 --> 02:11:54.180
<v Speaker 1>if you really do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they pull it away,</v>

2738
02:11:54.580 --> 02:11:55.830
<v Speaker 1>there's no more air travel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

2739
02:11:56.170 --> 02:11:59.930
<v Speaker 1>We're stuck here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how long it take to drive to Colorado to</v>

2740
02:11:59.970 --> 02:12:03.390
<v Speaker 1>that 16 hours and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't think about it going back</v>

2741
02:12:03.391 --> 02:12:05.370
<v Speaker 1>in time in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Different Times.</v>

2742
02:12:05.450 --> 02:12:10.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well at least you have cars say the </v>

2743
02:12:10.450 --> 02:12:10.450
<v Speaker 1>train.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2744
02:12:10.450 --> 02:12:11.180
<v Speaker 1>So is there anything else that we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2745
02:12:11.520 --> 02:12:13.620
<v Speaker 1>we might disagree on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hm,</v>

2746
02:12:13.890 --> 02:12:14.880
<v Speaker 1>let me disagree with.</v>

2747
02:12:16.240 --> 02:12:18.540
<v Speaker 2>I know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2748
02:12:19.870 --> 02:12:24.870
<v Speaker 2>I think we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we agree on the flat earth </v>

2749
02:12:24.870 --> 02:12:24.870
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2750
02:12:24.870 --> 02:12:24.870
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think the earth is round,</v>

2751
02:12:24.870 --> 02:12:27.250
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about a changed my tune.</v>

2752
02:12:27.340 --> 02:12:31.370
<v Speaker 2>What about did long Matt Delong?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

2759
02:12:45.541 --> 02:12:46.030
<v Speaker 1>since that podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of people have pointed out to me</v>

02:12:46.031 --> 02:12:51.031
<v Speaker 1>that he is essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are selling stock in a competence.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2763
02:12:57.510 --> 02:12:58.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I think $100,000</v>

2764
02:12:58.031 --> 02:12:59.680
<v Speaker 1>a year or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2765
02:12:59.740 --> 02:13:04.740
<v Speaker 1>whatever it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much money they take in what they </v>

2766
02:13:04.740 --> 02:13:06.580
<v Speaker 1>make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you get enough rubes to keep donating</v>

2767
02:13:06.581 --> 02:13:10.000
<v Speaker 1>money to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It mean he keeps saying stay tuned.</v>

2768
02:13:10.030 --> 02:13:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Things are gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said there's gonna be some videos </v>

2769
02:13:15.030 --> 02:13:15.030
<v Speaker 1>released.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2770
02:13:15.030 --> 02:13:16.600
<v Speaker 1>like nearly a month ago now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think dude,</v>

2771
02:13:16.601 --> 02:13:21.601
<v Speaker 1>when he was on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he played some videos for us that were </v>

2772
02:13:21.601 --> 02:13:22.600
<v Speaker 1>like absolutely ufos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I almost pissed my pants laughing.</v>

2773
02:13:22.930 --> 02:13:25.360
<v Speaker 1>They were so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so bad.</v>

2774
02:13:25.361 --> 02:13:27.430
<v Speaker 1>One of them was so fucking bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2775
02:13:27.431 --> 02:13:32.431
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that was in a movie I would want my </v>

2776
02:13:32.431 --> 02:13:32.431
<v Speaker 1>money back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be angry.</v>

2777
02:13:32.431 --> 02:13:32.431
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you mean easy?</v>

2778
02:13:32.431 --> 02:13:37.301
<v Speaker 1>A crazy guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or is he a smart guy who was making </v>

2779
02:13:37.301 --> 02:13:37.320
<v Speaker 1>money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not know.</v>

2780
02:13:37.380 --> 02:13:38.850
<v Speaker 1>I think it must.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It must like this,</v>

2781
02:13:38.930 --> 02:13:42.840
<v Speaker 1>this ufo stuff he loves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I stay saying I'm making money,</v>

2782
02:13:43.470 --> 02:13:48.470
<v Speaker 1>but the conversation I look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's two ways to approach this and I </v>

2783
02:13:48.470 --> 02:13:51.360
<v Speaker 1>tried to be district.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to be respectful because I'm the</v>

2784
02:13:51.361 --> 02:13:54.870
<v Speaker 1>host and he agreed to come here and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to talk about this so I'll try to</v>

2785
02:13:54.871 --> 02:13:59.871
<v Speaker 1>be respectful and let this guy talk and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what he was saying to me was so </v>

2786
02:14:00.721 --> 02:14:02.430
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2787
02:14:02.460 --> 02:14:07.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't even have to challenge him on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this because it's so obviously </v>

2788
02:14:07.460 --> 02:14:07.460
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous.</v>

2789
02:14:07.460 --> 02:14:09.090
<v Speaker 1>Everyone is going to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>

2790
02:14:09.960 --> 02:14:14.960
<v Speaker 1>I was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of people that listened </v>

2791
02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:15.930
<v Speaker 1>to that podcast that I saw on twitter </v>
<v Speaker 1>that thought that what he was saying was</v>

2792
02:14:15.931 --> 02:14:20.931
<v Speaker 1>mind blowing and this is real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are the people that are going to </v>

2793
02:14:20.931 --> 02:14:21.870
<v Speaker 1>donate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He exactly right.</v>

2794
02:14:22.110 --> 02:14:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there a problem with that?</v>

2795
02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:29.720
<v Speaker 1>Is there a problem with the Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 1>church because they're full of shit too.</v>

2796
02:14:31.300 --> 02:14:32.280
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2797
02:14:32.640 --> 02:14:37.640
<v Speaker 1>Catholic churches essentially a </v>
<v Speaker 1>moneymaking franchise and they don't </v>

2798
02:14:37.640 --> 02:14:37.830
<v Speaker 1>have to pay taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least he has to pay taxes.</v>

2799
02:14:37.831 --> 02:14:39.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there a.</v>

2800
02:14:39.250 --> 02:14:42.630
<v Speaker 1>is there a problem with conning rubes </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of money?</v>

2801
02:14:42.750 --> 02:14:45.300
<v Speaker 1>There's loads of kickstarter's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

2802
02:14:45.301 --> 02:14:47.960
<v Speaker 1>things that just could never work like </v>
<v Speaker 1>those days,</v>

2803
02:14:48.020 --> 02:14:53.020
<v Speaker 1>like clearer holograms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say you'll get to play video games </v>

2804
02:14:53.020 --> 02:14:53.020
<v Speaker 1>on the table in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2805
02:14:53.020 --> 02:14:55.940
<v Speaker 1>There's a go fund me's for people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have illnesses that.</v>

2806
02:14:56.180 --> 02:15:01.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like one way that they had a </v>

2807
02:15:01.180 --> 02:15:01.470
<v Speaker 1>water bottle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would magically take water out of the</v>

2808
02:15:01.471 --> 02:15:01.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2809
02:15:01.941 --> 02:15:02.920
<v Speaker 1>saw that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2810
02:15:02.940 --> 02:15:07.940
<v Speaker 1>But it doesn't actually work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would take like three days to fill </v>

2811
02:15:07.940 --> 02:15:09.410
<v Speaker 1>the bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were in a rain forest anyway,</v>

2812
02:15:09.940 --> 02:15:12.430
<v Speaker 1>require like a solar panel list,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this big,</v>

2813
02:15:12.700 --> 02:15:15.060
<v Speaker 1>it's just easy to bring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring your in.</v>

2814
02:15:15.260 --> 02:15:20.260
<v Speaker 1>But they raised like $2,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what do they have to do with that </v>

2815
02:15:20.260 --> 02:15:20.260
<v Speaker 1>money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're allowed to keep it.</v>

2816
02:15:20.260 --> 02:15:23.310
<v Speaker 1>They can keep it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they went to the kickstarter.</v>

2817
02:15:23.630 --> 02:15:28.630
<v Speaker 1>Kickstarter has this open thing where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're developing a prototype so it </v>

2818
02:15:29.371 --> 02:15:32.220
<v Speaker 1>doesn't actually have to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2819
02:15:32.250 --> 02:15:35.680
<v Speaker 1>So what happens with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all those people is this it us?</v>

2820
02:15:35.740 --> 02:15:40.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think they might've like Gogo </v>

2821
02:15:40.740 --> 02:15:45.141
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might've been on a couple of </v>

2822
02:15:45.141 --> 02:15:46.791
<v Speaker 1>different platforms and one of them is </v>
<v Speaker 1>more a more relaxed than the other in </v>

2823
02:15:47.191 --> 02:15:48.300
<v Speaker 1>terms of what it will allow.</v>

2824
02:15:48.320 --> 02:15:50.550
<v Speaker 1>Like one of them now you could have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>working prototype.</v>

2825
02:15:50.780 --> 02:15:52.850
<v Speaker 1>The self filling water bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2826
02:15:53.060 --> 02:15:56.130
<v Speaker 1>It's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Compulsively go created it.</v>

2827
02:15:56.270 --> 02:16:01.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of these eastern European </v>

2828
02:16:01.270 --> 02:16:02.610
<v Speaker 1>scientists types who do things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

2829
02:16:02.640 --> 02:16:07.640
<v Speaker 1>So they made it look like this dude's </v>
<v Speaker 1>just driving around and then this sense </v>

2830
02:16:07.640 --> 02:16:11.410
<v Speaker 1>of pull it out of air and then he can </v>
<v Speaker 1>just pull it out of the tube and wow,</v>

2831
02:16:11.551 --> 02:16:13.050
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got water all of a sudden.</v>

2832
02:16:13.270 --> 02:16:15.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can't possibly work.</v>

2833
02:16:15.810 --> 02:16:16.320
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2834
02:16:16.650 --> 02:16:21.650
<v Speaker 1>it uses a real technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like these little electrical things </v>

2835
02:16:21.650 --> 02:16:25.970
<v Speaker 1>actually cool things down and condense </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and it will actually condense a </v>

2836
02:16:25.970 --> 02:16:26.490
<v Speaker 1>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hardly anything.</v>

2837
02:16:26.970 --> 02:16:31.150
<v Speaker 1>So we'd take a long ass time for to fill</v>
<v Speaker 1>was basically a dehumidifier.</v>

2838
02:16:31.210 --> 02:16:33.730
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you have like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a dehumidifier.</v>

2839
02:16:33.960 --> 02:16:35.740
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the every humidifier.</v>

2840
02:16:35.770 --> 02:16:38.320
<v Speaker 1>Because California's drought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he ever have a dehumidifier,</v>

2841
02:16:38.440 --> 02:16:41.260
<v Speaker 1>it will eventually fill up the container</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the dehumidifier,</v>

2842
02:16:41.261 --> 02:16:46.261
<v Speaker 1>but this is this thing powered by </v>
<v Speaker 1>plugging it into the wall and it's this </v>

2843
02:16:46.261 --> 02:16:46.540
<v Speaker 1>big machine and it still takes all day </v>
<v Speaker 1>to fill up the reservoir.</v>

2844
02:16:47.050 --> 02:16:52.050
<v Speaker 1>So they're saying like a little water </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottle this size with a little solar </v>

2845
02:16:52.050 --> 02:16:53.200
<v Speaker 1>panel and this little condensing thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's this big.</v>

2846
02:16:53.201 --> 02:16:58.201
<v Speaker 1>We'll fill it up in a few hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe it's like physically </v>

2847
02:16:58.201 --> 02:17:02.461
<v Speaker 1>impossible physical face technology </v>
<v Speaker 1>swapping thing like 20 years ago it was </v>

2848
02:17:02.461 --> 02:17:06.811
<v Speaker 1>impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but 20 years from now they're playing </v>

2849
02:17:06.811 --> 02:17:06.811
<v Speaker 1>the long game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can water bottle,</v>

2850
02:17:06.811 --> 02:17:09.130
<v Speaker 1>you can improve computers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't really improve the laws of</v>

2851
02:17:09.131 --> 02:17:14.131
<v Speaker 1>physics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can only get so much water out of </v>

2852
02:17:14.131 --> 02:17:15.950
<v Speaker 1>the parcel parcel of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they would have to have some sort of </v>

2853
02:17:15.950 --> 02:17:17.140
<v Speaker 1>better mechanism for extracting it than </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing.</v>

2854
02:17:18.150 --> 02:17:18.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

2855
02:17:18.580 --> 02:17:20.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's certainly a lot of scams </v>
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>

2856
02:17:20.771 --> 02:17:25.771
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's what he's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I talked to people that knew him </v>

2857
02:17:25.771 --> 02:17:28.600
<v Speaker 1>from a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been obsessed with Ufo is forever.</v>

2858
02:17:28.810 --> 02:17:31.570
<v Speaker 1>So his obsession seems to be legitimate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

2859
02:17:31.571 --> 02:17:34.120
<v Speaker 1>when I was talking to him about all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>events and I was like,</v>

2860
02:17:34.121 --> 02:17:36.850
<v Speaker 1>tell me what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta a guy contacted you.</v>

2861
02:17:36.851 --> 02:17:39.580
<v Speaker 1>While I can't say who I can't say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't say what it was,</v>

2862
02:17:39.820 --> 02:17:41.440
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell you that we can't get into </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2863
02:17:41.650 --> 02:17:44.380
<v Speaker 1>That's all bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When someone starts talking like that,</v>

2864
02:17:44.381 --> 02:17:45.300
<v Speaker 1>they're full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

2865
02:17:45.520 --> 02:17:50.380
<v Speaker 1>he definitely seemed to be a combination</v>
<v Speaker 1>of deceptive and delusional.</v>

2866
02:17:50.790 --> 02:17:51.190
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2867
02:17:52.170 --> 02:17:57.170
<v Speaker 2>the slides that he used in the talk to </v>
<v Speaker 2>illustrate there was an event of some </v>

2868
02:17:58.261 --> 02:18:01.440
<v Speaker 2>Ufo buzzing a aircraft carrier and some </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighter jets.</v>

2869
02:18:01.441 --> 02:18:06.441
<v Speaker 2>We're going after it and they couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>find it and they put up some slides on </v>

2870
02:18:06.441 --> 02:18:09.300
<v Speaker 2>the screen there which looked like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>shiny silver penis flying around.</v>

2871
02:18:10.390 --> 02:18:13.770
<v Speaker 2>And it was actually something that type </v>
<v Speaker 2>of thing we do on metal bunks,</v>

2872
02:18:13.780 --> 02:18:16.680
<v Speaker 2>identify objects like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we figured out what this was and it's</v>

2873
02:18:16.681 --> 02:18:20.310
<v Speaker 2>actually a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a number one numerical helium balloon,</v>

2874
02:18:20.790 --> 02:18:23.790
<v Speaker 2>like the digit one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

2875
02:18:23.820 --> 02:18:28.820
<v Speaker 2>Like someone's like from a party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I found like a bunch of other shots </v>

2876
02:18:28.820 --> 02:18:32.301
<v Speaker 2>of the same thing where you can see it </v>
<v Speaker 2>rotating and you can see it's fairly </v>

2877
02:18:32.301 --> 02:18:32.301
<v Speaker 2>clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's this number one,</v>

2878
02:18:32.301 --> 02:18:33.050
<v Speaker 2>but it's on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2879
02:18:33.480 --> 02:18:34.230
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2880
02:18:34.610 --> 02:18:36.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy website.</v>

2881
02:18:36.271 --> 02:18:38.190
<v Speaker 2>They thought it was a Ufo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he got it off that.</v>

2882
02:18:38.190 --> 02:18:40.920
<v Speaker 2>And so this is a Ufo took the image,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of degraded a bit.</v>

2883
02:18:40.921 --> 02:18:45.921
<v Speaker 2>So you can't reach out to where it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was quite hard for me to track it </v>

2884
02:18:45.921 --> 02:18:46.570
<v Speaker 2>down because he'd mess with it so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was actually just this,</v>

2885
02:18:46.640 --> 02:18:50.040
<v Speaker 2>this helium balloon that was a white </v>
<v Speaker 2>shiny.</v>

2886
02:18:50.370 --> 02:18:55.370
<v Speaker 2>What's disturbing to me is that he's got</v>
<v Speaker 2>this business that claims to be some </v>

2887
02:18:56.701 --> 02:19:01.701
<v Speaker 2>sort of aerospace business and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved in it with all these other </v>

2888
02:19:01.701 --> 02:19:01.950
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's weird because the guy who's running</v>

2889
02:19:01.951 --> 02:19:05.310
<v Speaker 2>that a can't remember his name for </v>
<v Speaker 2>fortune or something like that,</v>

2890
02:19:05.670 --> 02:19:10.670
<v Speaker 2>is like a real guy who worked at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lockheed Martin or somewhere and the </v>

2891
02:19:10.670 --> 02:19:14.310
<v Speaker 2>skunkworks amy started doing adderall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>started getting crazy.</v>

2892
02:19:14.600 --> 02:19:17.130
<v Speaker 2>Know what he's talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes no sense whatsoever.</v>

2893
02:19:17.131 --> 02:19:22.131
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our mission is to take what the science </v>

2894
02:19:22.131 --> 02:19:23.790
<v Speaker 2>division gives us and we'll turn that </v>
<v Speaker 2>science into flying craft.</v>

2895
02:19:23.980 --> 02:19:26.040
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at the science division does.</v>

2896
02:19:26.100 --> 02:19:27.980
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2897
02:19:28.010 --> 02:19:33.010
<v Speaker 1>They've got like a guy who's like one </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy who was interested in like shooting </v>

2898
02:19:33.010 --> 02:19:34.430
<v Speaker 1>a things with lasers to make them go </v>
<v Speaker 1>fast.</v>

2899
02:19:34.820 --> 02:19:36.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the weird things.</v>

2900
02:19:36.530 --> 02:19:38.480
<v Speaker 1>We're not just talking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just gonna have a real technology.</v>

2901
02:19:38.481 --> 02:19:41.600
<v Speaker 1>You can use a laser to power power of </v>
<v Speaker 1>craft,</v>

2902
02:19:41.630 --> 02:19:43.010
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not what they're talking about.</v>

2903
02:19:43.011 --> 02:19:45.590
<v Speaker 1>That talking about some kind of crap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wolves,</v>

2904
02:19:45.591 --> 02:19:50.591
<v Speaker 1>the very nature of time and space itself</v>
<v Speaker 1>to kind of ride rides a wave of a.</v>

2905
02:19:51.311 --> 02:19:53.760
<v Speaker 1>we're a wormhole or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2906
02:19:54.010 --> 02:19:59.010
<v Speaker 1>and this guy thinks that it's plausible </v>
<v Speaker 1>and only have to do is kind of like try </v>

2907
02:19:59.010 --> 02:19:59.010
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really hard.</v>

2908
02:19:59.030 --> 02:20:04.030
<v Speaker 1>If they put their heads together and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this scientists who all this </v>

2909
02:20:04.030 --> 02:20:05.960
<v Speaker 1>science a lot and then these builders do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really good building based on these</v>

2910
02:20:05.961 --> 02:20:07.340
<v Speaker 1>really good science they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get.</v>

2911
02:20:07.341 --> 02:20:12.341
<v Speaker 1>Then they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll get this flying craft Johnson's </v>

2912
02:20:12.341 --> 02:20:12.341
<v Speaker 1>nothing's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't.</v>

2913
02:20:12.470 --> 02:20:15.890
<v Speaker 1>Having people donated some something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like $2,000,000</v>

2914
02:20:15.891 --> 02:20:19.310
<v Speaker 1>or something goofy like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many fucking people have done that?</v>

2915
02:20:19.860 --> 02:20:24.700
<v Speaker 1>See if you can find that out to 2000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>90 two people have donated</v>

2916
02:20:24.710 --> 02:20:25.580
<v Speaker 6>$2,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2917
02:20:26.300 --> 02:20:28.070
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's a thousand dollars each.</v>

2918
02:20:28.100 --> 02:20:30.020
<v Speaker 1>That's a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That seems wrong.</v>

2919
02:20:30.570 --> 02:20:33.790
<v Speaker 6>I know the numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the numbers have changed frequently.</v>

2920
02:20:33.950 --> 02:20:38.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the numbers seemed really high in terms </v>

2921
02:20:38.950 --> 02:20:38.950
<v Speaker 1>of the amount of donations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's very odd.</v>

2922
02:20:38.950 --> 02:20:42.410
<v Speaker 1>You're going to get 2000 people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>donate a thousand dollars each.</v>

2923
02:20:42.411 --> 02:20:45.550
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't seem right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be a few very large donors that</v>

2924
02:20:45.551 --> 02:20:50.551
<v Speaker 1>is somehow convinced to donate via this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are a lot of really fucking crazy </v>

2925
02:20:51.291 --> 02:20:55.520
<v Speaker 1>old people that believe in this shit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might have a ton of money.</v>

2926
02:20:55.730 --> 02:20:58.000
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that red line meant to represent?</v>

2927
02:20:58.040 --> 02:21:03.040
<v Speaker 1>Kind of looks like they're flying right </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the stars.</v>

2928
02:21:05.570 --> 02:21:08.060
<v Speaker 1>Academy of Arts and science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what kills me.</v>

2929
02:21:08.061 --> 02:21:08.990
<v Speaker 1>What kind of arts?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

2930
02:21:08.991 --> 02:21:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Fingerprint.</v>

2931
02:21:09.920 --> 02:21:14.920
<v Speaker 6>I'm always tracking those numbers for </v>
<v Speaker 6>awhile and they were going up </v>

2932
02:21:14.920 --> 02:21:17.770
<v Speaker 6>proportionately.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If that's the correct word to say from </v>

2933
02:21:17.770 --> 02:21:19.901
<v Speaker 6>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The one that number was going up while </v>

2934
02:21:19.901 --> 02:21:22.961
<v Speaker 6>the number,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the dollar number was sort of staying </v>

2935
02:21:22.961 --> 02:21:22.961
<v Speaker 6>the same,</v>

2936
02:21:22.961 --> 02:21:24.490
<v Speaker 1>so maybe he was calling these people if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you double your off,</v>

2937
02:21:24.491 --> 02:21:29.491
<v Speaker 1>getting a lot of people on the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>ship submitted Mo of 200 I think really </v>

2938
02:21:29.870 --> 02:21:32.000
<v Speaker 1>sound this bold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bold print down the.</v>

2939
02:21:32.350 --> 02:21:37.350
<v Speaker 1>So some large donations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing though to still pretty </v>

2940
02:21:37.350 --> 02:21:38.980
<v Speaker 1>large.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donated $2,000,000</v>

2941
02:21:39.490 --> 02:21:41.560
<v Speaker 1>to this wacky ass fucking company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2942
02:21:41.561 --> 02:21:44.860
<v Speaker 1>and Ole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the company is required to do is pay</v>

2943
02:21:44.861 --> 02:21:49.861
<v Speaker 1>delong $100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year for the next seven years or </v>

2944
02:21:49.861 --> 02:21:52.650
<v Speaker 1>something and that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

2945
02:21:52.660 --> 02:21:57.660
<v Speaker 1>The crazy thing too is that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he had been contacted by the </v>

2946
02:21:57.660 --> 02:22:01.351
<v Speaker 1>government because they knew that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>could go on shows like mine and talk </v>

2947
02:22:01.351 --> 02:22:05.431
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he would have a platform because </v>

2948
02:22:05.431 --> 02:22:05.431
<v Speaker 1>he's a rockstar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2949
02:22:05.431 --> 02:22:06.480
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like some.</v>

2950
02:22:06.820 --> 02:22:11.050
<v Speaker 1>Why didn't they stop him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is some bad movie shit.</v>

2951
02:22:11.710 --> 02:22:15.670
<v Speaker 1>Like this narrative is like a bad movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that people like say they didn't want</v>

2952
02:22:15.671 --> 02:22:20.671
<v Speaker 1>to talk to me on the phone because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're afraid of the government </v>

2953
02:22:20.671 --> 02:22:20.860
<v Speaker 1>tracking them down and assassinating </v>
<v Speaker 1>them or whatever.</v>

2954
02:22:21.400 --> 02:22:24.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm talking to you on </v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook.</v>

2955
02:22:26.300 --> 02:22:27.190
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2956
02:22:27.270 --> 02:22:29.200
<v Speaker 2>if I really was like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2957
02:22:29.490 --> 02:22:32.010
<v Speaker 2>agents of the government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wouldn't be very hard to just say,</v>

2958
02:22:32.011 --> 02:22:32.480
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get,</v>

2959
02:22:32.580 --> 02:22:33.960
<v Speaker 2>get rid of this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big one.</v>

2960
02:22:33.961 --> 02:22:36.300
<v Speaker 2>They like to pull on you because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>debunk things.</v>

2961
02:22:36.380 --> 02:22:38.970
<v Speaker 2>You're an agent of the government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2962
02:22:39.570 --> 02:22:41.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's really hard one to get around.</v>

2963
02:22:41.161 --> 02:22:42.800
<v Speaker 2>I think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my approach there,</v>

2964
02:22:42.810 --> 02:22:45.210
<v Speaker 2>I was just to be as honest as possible </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time,</v>

2965
02:22:45.450 --> 02:22:47.620
<v Speaker 2>so I always tell them exactly who I am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that.</v>

2966
02:22:47.630 --> 02:22:50.070
<v Speaker 2>I made lots of money during the Tony </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hawk video games.</v>

2967
02:22:50.071 --> 02:22:52.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like British video game </v>
<v Speaker 2>programmer.</v>

2968
02:22:53.340 --> 02:22:56.580
<v Speaker 2>Basically my life story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't buy it.</v>

2969
02:22:56.730 --> 02:22:58.650
<v Speaker 2>They don't buy in it pal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>

2970
02:22:58.651 --> 02:23:00.020
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think some of them it,</v>

2971
02:23:00.080 --> 02:23:03.420
<v Speaker 2>it helps telling them about the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>About Tony Hawk.</v>

2972
02:23:03.590 --> 02:23:08.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of them actually are fans of </v>

2973
02:23:08.590 --> 02:23:08.590
<v Speaker 2>Tony Hall and that's funny actually.</v>

2974
02:23:08.880 --> 02:23:09.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2975
02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:15.000
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those things where if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't want to believe you're not going </v>

2976
02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:18.531
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna like that's a likely cover </v>

2977
02:23:18.531 --> 02:23:18.531
<v Speaker 2>story for a guy and then then they'll go</v>
<v Speaker 2>super deep.</v>

2978
02:23:18.720 --> 02:23:23.720
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government has infiltrated video </v>

2979
02:23:23.720 --> 02:23:25.221
<v Speaker 2>games in order to keep kids stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've created these games in order to </v>

2980
02:23:25.221 --> 02:23:29.160
<v Speaker 2>mess with the kids' minds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one reaction I get quite a bit is </v>

2981
02:23:29.160 --> 02:23:29.160
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am stupid.</v>

2982
02:23:29.290 --> 02:23:30.120
<v Speaker 2>You're stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2983
02:23:30.121 --> 02:23:32.100
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people will say that I am </v>
<v Speaker 2>really stupid.</v>

2984
02:23:32.530 --> 02:23:35.090
<v Speaker 2>Those people like who were in like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2985
02:23:35.140 --> 02:23:40.140
<v Speaker 2>the architects and engineers when nine </v>
<v Speaker 2>slash 11 truth type thing who think the </v>

2986
02:23:40.140 --> 02:23:40.650
<v Speaker 2>time really stupid and don't understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>physics at all.</v>

2987
02:23:41.190 --> 02:23:45.240
<v Speaker 2>And so that they say that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not a government agent.</v>

2988
02:23:45.570 --> 02:23:50.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm just this really stupid dude who </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't understand what actually </v>

2989
02:23:50.570 --> 02:23:50.880
<v Speaker 2>happened in nine slash 11 useful idiot.</v>

2990
02:23:50.880 --> 02:23:51.840
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2991
02:23:51.860 --> 02:23:54.360
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not just in the useful idiot in that</v>

2992
02:23:54.361 --> 02:23:56.250
<v Speaker 2>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a person who,</v>

2993
02:23:56.940 --> 02:23:58.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is just mistaken.</v>

2994
02:23:58.850 --> 02:24:03.850
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it just so then they can dismiss my </v>

2995
02:24:03.850 --> 02:24:05.751
<v Speaker 2>videos by laughing at them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I do lots of little videos where I </v>

2996
02:24:05.751 --> 02:24:07.020
<v Speaker 2>do things like demonstrate how something</v>
<v Speaker 2>buckles,</v>

2997
02:24:07.050 --> 02:24:12.050
<v Speaker 2>like a column buckling when you put a </v>
<v Speaker 2>load on it or you think things like </v>

2998
02:24:12.841 --> 02:24:17.841
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just just physics videos and then they </v>

2999
02:24:17.841 --> 02:24:17.841
<v Speaker 2>just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3000
02:24:17.841 --> 02:24:17.841
<v Speaker 2>you're an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't need to look at this video.</v>

3001
02:24:18.400 --> 02:24:23.400
<v Speaker 2>So it's a way of getting around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem and a lot of other people say </v>

3002
02:24:23.400 --> 02:24:27.351
<v Speaker 2>that I'm so smart about chem trails and </v>
<v Speaker 2>things like that that I must be a </v>

3003
02:24:27.351 --> 02:24:27.640
<v Speaker 2>government agent because I know so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>about contrarian,</v>

3004
02:24:28.350 --> 02:24:33.350
<v Speaker 2>so I get both sides of and why they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>really smart government agent or I'm </v>

3005
02:24:33.350 --> 02:24:33.990
<v Speaker 2>just a stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a useful idiot.</v>

3006
02:24:34.140 --> 02:24:39.140
<v Speaker 2>Well it's just them looking at you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to find some way to dismiss what </v>

3007
02:24:39.140 --> 02:24:39.240
<v Speaker 2>you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>

3008
02:24:39.270 --> 02:24:41.580
<v Speaker 2>you really get a kick out of debunking </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

3009
02:24:41.880 --> 02:24:46.880
<v Speaker 2>I do span the backyard science stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a thing I did recently where </v>

3010
02:24:47.641 --> 02:24:48.850
<v Speaker 2>A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3011
02:24:48.900 --> 02:24:52.350
<v Speaker 2>so the scientists were saying that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bits falling off the world trade center,</v>

3012
02:24:52.351 --> 02:24:54.510
<v Speaker 2>we're leaving trails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That must be fraud.</v>

3013
02:24:54.511 --> 02:24:57.630
<v Speaker 2>And the rocket motors that are pushing </v>
<v Speaker 2>them away from the World Trade Center.</v>

3014
02:24:58.080 --> 02:25:01.400
<v Speaker 2>So I said now he's probably just some </v>
<v Speaker 2>some dust on it and they say no,</v>

3015
02:25:01.401 --> 02:25:03.150
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't live a long trail.</v>

3016
02:25:03.390 --> 02:25:08.390
<v Speaker 2>So I got a big sledgehammer and I piled </v>
<v Speaker 2>some some ashes on it from my fireplace.</v>

3017
02:25:08.551 --> 02:25:13.551
<v Speaker 2>And then I stood on top of a wall and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was throwing this sledgehammer with a </v>

3018
02:25:13.551 --> 02:25:17.421
<v Speaker 2>big trailer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dust is coming from it for like half an </v>

3019
02:25:17.421 --> 02:25:17.421
<v Speaker 2>hour videoing myself doing it until I </v>
<v Speaker 2>got some of the,</v>

3020
02:25:17.490 --> 02:25:20.550
<v Speaker 2>some representative videos of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just fun to do.</v>

3021
02:25:20.760 --> 02:25:22.110
<v Speaker 2>It is kind of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3022
02:25:22.111 --> 02:25:23.680
<v Speaker 2>one of the ones that kept up</v>

3023
02:25:24.460 --> 02:25:29.460
<v Speaker 1>that I thought was the most ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing about the flat earth was I read </v>

3024
02:25:29.460 --> 02:25:33.301
<v Speaker 1>this a couple of places where people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about ships disappearing on the </v>

3025
02:25:33.301 --> 02:25:35.230
<v Speaker 1>horizon and then the ship disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you pulled out,</v>

3026
02:25:35.231 --> 02:25:38.080
<v Speaker 1>if you zoom in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can still see the ship.</v>

3027
02:25:38.140 --> 02:25:39.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

3028
02:25:39.011 --> 02:25:44.011
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how come you can't see Mount Everest </v>

3029
02:25:44.011 --> 02:25:44.011
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why can't you look towards Japan?</v>

3030
02:25:44.011 --> 02:25:45.100
<v Speaker 1>Where's Mt Kilimanjaro?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get up.</v>

3031
02:25:45.310 --> 02:25:47.890
<v Speaker 1>How come you can see the moon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could see the moon.</v>

3032
02:25:47.891 --> 02:25:50.290
<v Speaker 1>If you get a good telescope,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could see the moon really clearly.</v>

3033
02:25:50.291 --> 02:25:53.020
<v Speaker 1>Take that telescope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't point at the moon point across the</v>

3034
02:25:53.021 --> 02:25:54.760
<v Speaker 1>ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where's the mountains?</v>

3035
02:25:55.250 --> 02:26:00.250
<v Speaker 1>The atmosphere that the kind of advanced</v>
<v Speaker 1>special.</v>

3036
02:26:00.811 --> 02:26:05.811
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about how not architects </v>

3037
02:26:05.811 --> 02:26:07.411
<v Speaker 1>and engineers when nine slash 11 have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do this really I'd punch thing now </v>

3038
02:26:07.411 --> 02:26:08.470
<v Speaker 1>because we've debunked the basic stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>so they can move to this advanced stuff.</v>

3039
02:26:08.920 --> 02:26:11.950
<v Speaker 1>Same thing with the flat earth people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they can.</v>

3040
02:26:12.010 --> 02:26:17.010
<v Speaker 1>You demonstrate how things actually do </v>
<v Speaker 1>go over the horizon and we're going to </v>

3041
02:26:17.010 --> 02:26:20.931
<v Speaker 1>do get obscured by the horizon and how </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sunsets and things like that and so </v>

3042
02:26:20.931 --> 02:26:25.321
<v Speaker 1>they come up with a complicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation where there's this kind of </v>

3043
02:26:25.321 --> 02:26:28.141
<v Speaker 1>giant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a refractive lens of atmosphere above </v>

3044
02:26:28.141 --> 02:26:31.951
<v Speaker 1>the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is bending all the light from the </v>

3045
02:26:31.951 --> 02:26:34.651
<v Speaker 1>sun in such a way that the earth appears</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be round even though he's actually </v>

3046
02:26:35.261 --> 02:26:36.340
<v Speaker 1>flat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don Don,</v>

3047
02:26:36.341 --> 02:26:39.700
<v Speaker 1>Don,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which kind of begs the question like,</v>

3048
02:26:39.701 --> 02:26:41.980
<v Speaker 1>how do they actually know it's round?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it looks,</v>

3049
02:26:42.010 --> 02:26:44.900
<v Speaker 1>how do they know it's flat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it looks round right,</v>

3050
02:26:45.660 --> 02:26:48.400
<v Speaker 1>like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are disappearing over the horizon</v>

3051
02:26:48.490 --> 02:26:52.090
<v Speaker 1>as if it looks round because of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>refraction thing,</v>

3052
02:26:53.040 --> 02:26:56.050
<v Speaker 1>but they think it's flat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it looks round,</v>

3053
02:26:56.051 --> 02:26:58.900
<v Speaker 1>why are they thinking explant?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3054
02:26:58.901 --> 02:27:02.680
<v Speaker 1>the thing that killed me was that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could zoom in on it and that proved that</v>

3055
02:27:02.681 --> 02:27:07.681
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it wasn't actually disappearing </v>

3056
02:27:07.681 --> 02:27:07.681
<v Speaker 1>over the horizon.</v>

3057
02:27:07.681 --> 02:27:11.070
<v Speaker 1>I know a little bit about optics because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my fascination with the outdoors.</v>

3058
02:27:12.401 --> 02:27:15.430
<v Speaker 1>I have a bunch of binoculars spotting </v>
<v Speaker 1>scopes,</v>

3059
02:27:15.431 --> 02:27:20.431
<v Speaker 1>various power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's things you just cannot see </v>

3060
02:27:20.431 --> 02:27:24.110
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you get a good spotting scope on </v>

3061
02:27:24.110 --> 02:27:24.110
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with the naked eye,</v>

3062
02:27:24.110 --> 02:27:24.520
<v Speaker 1>like there's things you can't see with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the naked eye,</v>

3063
02:27:24.521 --> 02:27:27.190
<v Speaker 1>you would swear they do not exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not there,</v>

3064
02:27:27.580 --> 02:27:31.030
<v Speaker 1>but then you get a great spotting scope </v>
<v Speaker 1>on them and you could see him miles away</v>

3065
02:27:31.540 --> 02:27:34.240
<v Speaker 1>and that's the thing with ships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got a large ship.</v>

3066
02:27:34.510 --> 02:27:39.510
<v Speaker 1>It goes far enough away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't see it anymore and you'll be </v>

3067
02:27:39.510 --> 02:27:43.051
<v Speaker 1>convinced that it's disappeared over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>horizon when in fact it's only probably </v>

3068
02:27:43.051 --> 02:27:47.050
<v Speaker 1>a couple of inches lower on the horizon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As far as like the curve of the earth,</v>

3069
02:27:47.051 --> 02:27:50.620
<v Speaker 1>but to the naked eye,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's invisible because so when they zoom</v>

3070
02:27:50.621 --> 02:27:52.840
<v Speaker 1>in on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're convinced that Aha,</v>

3071
02:27:53.020 --> 02:27:54.490
<v Speaker 1>there is no curvature of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

3072
02:27:54.491 --> 02:27:56.290
<v Speaker 1>this looked like it went over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>horizon,</v>

3073
02:27:56.530 --> 02:27:58.390
<v Speaker 1>but it's an optical illusion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3074
02:27:58.440 --> 02:28:00.880
<v Speaker 1>and the thing is that I've been sharing </v>
<v Speaker 1>this so many times because this actually</v>

3075
02:28:00.881 --> 02:28:05.881
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was this so many videos now on </v>

3076
02:28:05.881 --> 02:28:07.951
<v Speaker 1>youtube that actually demonstrate this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing like this time lapses of ships </v>

3077
02:28:07.951 --> 02:28:11.761
<v Speaker 1>going over the horizon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like zoomed in all the way with that p </v>

3078
02:28:11.761 --> 02:28:15.360
<v Speaker 1>900 cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do like an 83 times zoom as big as </v>

3079
02:28:15.360 --> 02:28:15.360
<v Speaker 1>you can go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

3080
02:28:15.360 --> 02:28:17.940
<v Speaker 1>It's been demonstrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just ignore her.</v>

3081
02:28:17.980 --> 02:28:21.950
<v Speaker 1>They say they ignore it because it's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>in their same q.</v>

3082
02:28:22.590 --> 02:28:25.220
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the play in the flat </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth video,</v>

3083
02:28:25.221 --> 02:28:27.790
<v Speaker 2>all the cue to the right is like flat </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth expose.</v>

3084
02:28:29.330 --> 02:28:31.100
<v Speaker 2>Some of those get hundreds of thousands </v>
<v Speaker 2>of views.</v>

3085
02:28:31.101 --> 02:28:32.510
<v Speaker 2>This is one guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dr Zack,</v>

3086
02:28:32.520 --> 02:28:37.520
<v Speaker 2>who's a foreign guy who does the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does these,</v>

3087
02:28:38.660 --> 02:28:43.660
<v Speaker 2>the these flutters videos and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>all mathematically sharing things in </v>

3088
02:28:43.660 --> 02:28:45.920
<v Speaker 2>autocad with drawn lines and stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he gets like 400,000</v>

3089
02:28:45.921 --> 02:28:47.170
<v Speaker 2>views.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

3090
02:28:47.180 --> 02:28:48.290
<v Speaker 2>It's bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3091
02:28:48.291 --> 02:28:52.550
<v Speaker 2>it's just amazing that so many people </v>
<v Speaker 2>get get into this and they buy into it.</v>

3092
02:28:52.551 --> 02:28:56.000
<v Speaker 2>Do you see that one where that young man</v>
<v Speaker 2>took a spirit ruler,</v>

3093
02:28:56.630 --> 02:29:01.630
<v Speaker 2>spirit level on an airplane is flying </v>
<v Speaker 2>around in airplanes and was convinced </v>

3094
02:29:01.630 --> 02:29:04.160
<v Speaker 2>Darrell Martin is the guy's name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He lives in a van.</v>

3095
02:29:04.540 --> 02:29:05.390
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3096
02:29:05.391 --> 02:29:08.720
<v Speaker 2>He has a bunch of videos on van life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a cool guy.</v>

3097
02:29:08.840 --> 02:29:13.840
<v Speaker 2>He's a very nice guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's got this weird idea about </v>

3098
02:29:13.840 --> 02:29:13.840
<v Speaker 2>aflutter.</v>

3099
02:29:13.840 --> 02:29:17.100
<v Speaker 2>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had a few youtube battles with him </v>

3100
02:29:17.100 --> 02:29:21.560
<v Speaker 2>where he puts up something about how the</v>
<v Speaker 2>moon is cooling things and he has this </v>

3101
02:29:24.080 --> 02:29:28.460
<v Speaker 2>thermometer thing showing that the moon </v>
<v Speaker 2>is actually making things cold.</v>

3102
02:29:28.730 --> 02:29:31.330
<v Speaker 2>Then I put up a videos explaining why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3103
02:29:31.331 --> 02:29:33.770
<v Speaker 2>it's just a reflection because he's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>infrared.</v>

3104
02:29:33.780 --> 02:29:38.780
<v Speaker 2>Thermometers don't work that way and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then he puts another thing like debunk </v>

3105
02:29:38.780 --> 02:29:40.250
<v Speaker 2>this mic west.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I gave up at that point.</v>

3106
02:29:40.700 --> 02:29:42.740
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't a separate short battle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3107
02:29:43.010 --> 02:29:46.730
<v Speaker 2>the weird thing is that they see all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these other planets is round,</v>

3108
02:29:47.150 --> 02:29:51.050
<v Speaker 2>but they decided that the earth is flat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's some sort of a flat disk.</v>

3109
02:29:51.080 --> 02:29:52.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing is that different.</v>

3110
02:29:52.760 --> 02:29:57.760
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are these tiny little bowls that </v>

3111
02:29:57.760 --> 02:30:00.911
<v Speaker 2>are like two miles wide or something and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think the earth is really close to </v>

3112
02:30:00.911 --> 02:30:01.040
<v Speaker 2>the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3113
02:30:01.050 --> 02:30:02.590
<v Speaker 2>I think it's about 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>miles away.</v>

3114
02:30:04.100 --> 02:30:05.480
<v Speaker 2>Four miles away.</v>

3115
02:30:08.410 --> 02:30:10.040
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you fucking idiots.</v>

3116
02:30:10.740 --> 02:30:14.480
<v Speaker 2>They think the distance to the sun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Various depending on the Observer.</v>

3117
02:30:15.740 --> 02:30:17.020
<v Speaker 2>Observer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dependent.</v>

3118
02:30:17.070 --> 02:30:18.200
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like where you are.</v>

3119
02:30:18.700 --> 02:30:20.580
<v Speaker 2>It's only four miles away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if,</v>

3120
02:30:20.850 --> 02:30:23.180
<v Speaker 2>if you drive away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just get super small,</v>

3121
02:30:23.181 --> 02:30:25.110
<v Speaker 2>like what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3122
02:30:25.240 --> 02:30:27.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean it makes no sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so ridiculous,</v>

3123
02:30:27.860 --> 02:30:32.860
<v Speaker 2>but it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me it's such a strange thing to </v>

3124
02:30:32.860 --> 02:30:35.231
<v Speaker 2>concentrate on that this is like their </v>
<v Speaker 2>identity is wholly invested in improving</v>

3125
02:30:37.341 --> 02:30:40.250
<v Speaker 2>this thing to be some sort of a massive </v>
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy.</v>

3126
02:30:40.650 --> 02:30:41.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

3127
02:30:41.331 --> 02:30:42.710
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very strange.</v>

3128
02:30:42.850 --> 02:30:44.090
<v Speaker 2>It's love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You love it.</v>

3129
02:30:44.210 --> 02:30:45.170
<v Speaker 2>They love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You love it.</v>

3130
02:30:45.550 --> 02:30:46.760
<v Speaker 2>You love debunking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

3131
02:30:46.761 --> 02:30:51.761
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a rabbit hole for debunkers is a </v>

3132
02:30:51.761 --> 02:30:55.360
<v Speaker 2>flyer that you just get sucked into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the best ones because it's </v>

3133
02:30:55.360 --> 02:30:55.360
<v Speaker 2>so silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>

3134
02:30:55.360 --> 02:30:57.980
<v Speaker 2>There's no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's the thing that people send me.</v>

3135
02:30:58.040 --> 02:31:03.040
<v Speaker 2>People like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they're trolling me or </v>

3136
02:31:03.040 --> 02:31:05.411
<v Speaker 2>if they're serious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll send me a picture of a glacier </v>

3137
02:31:05.411 --> 02:31:06.530
<v Speaker 2>and they'll go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's your fucking your ice wall.</v>

3138
02:31:06.890 --> 02:31:11.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They show you the real shelf or </v>

3139
02:31:11.890 --> 02:31:11.890
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like an actual ice shelf on Toptica.</v>

3140
02:31:12.300 --> 02:31:13.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can look up the video,</v>

3141
02:31:13.430 --> 02:31:16.310
<v Speaker 2>the picture and see what it actually is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The government,</v>

3142
02:31:16.340 --> 02:31:19.770
<v Speaker 2>the government is guarding the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ice wall</v>

3143
02:31:20.040 --> 02:31:21.600
<v Speaker 1>all around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you can't get near it.</v>

3144
02:31:21.601 --> 02:31:22.980
<v Speaker 1>Take pictures of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3145
02:31:23.020 --> 02:31:28.020
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the southern hemisphere is a huge </v>

3146
02:31:28.020 --> 02:31:28.020
<v Speaker 1>problem for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3147
02:31:28.020 --> 02:31:28.730
<v Speaker 1>for the flood of authors because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can,</v>

3148
02:31:28.770 --> 02:31:32.430
<v Speaker 1>you can have somebody standing on light </v>
<v Speaker 1>the south of South America.</v>

3149
02:31:32.431 --> 02:31:34.470
<v Speaker 1>So I went to in Australia and they both </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking south,</v>

3150
02:31:34.471 --> 02:31:37.740
<v Speaker 1>which on a desk will be away looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely different directions.</v>

3151
02:31:37.741 --> 02:31:39.270
<v Speaker 1>And they're both actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3152
02:31:39.271 --> 02:31:41.220
<v Speaker 1>because they're both fairly close to </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other really.</v>

3153
02:31:41.310 --> 02:31:43.020
<v Speaker 1>They're looking at the same stars in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sky.</v>

3154
02:31:43.160 --> 02:31:44.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's this,</v>

3155
02:31:44.880 --> 02:31:47.750
<v Speaker 1>even though they're really complicated </v>
<v Speaker 1>explanations for the flush of.</v>

3156
02:31:47.820 --> 02:31:50.160
<v Speaker 1>Don't explain that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the.</v>

3157
02:31:50.700 --> 02:31:55.700
<v Speaker 1>The hot irrefutable proofs of a round a </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly changing their story based on</v>

3158
02:31:59.011 --> 02:32:04.011
<v Speaker 1>what gets debunked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the big one that do bay was saying </v>

3159
02:32:04.011 --> 02:32:07.941
<v Speaker 1>forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every photograph of earth from space is </v>

3160
02:32:07.941 --> 02:32:07.941
<v Speaker 1>a composite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's not true.</v>

3161
02:32:08.460 --> 02:32:11.490
<v Speaker 1>They have full scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Full image,</v>

3162
02:32:11.790 --> 02:32:15.150
<v Speaker 1>high resolution photographs from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] eight.</v>

3163
02:32:15.270 --> 02:32:15.900
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are fake.</v>

3164
02:32:15.930 --> 02:32:19.410
<v Speaker 1>Then they decided that those are fake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at first it was those,</v>

3165
02:32:19.440 --> 02:32:24.440
<v Speaker 1>they're composites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which there was some composites from </v>

3166
02:32:24.440 --> 02:32:26.320
<v Speaker 1>lower side lights and then blue marble </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

3167
02:32:26.460 --> 02:32:27.380
<v Speaker 1>That's how that goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stuff.</v>

3168
02:32:27.400 --> 02:32:30.790
<v Speaker 1>It is the famous issue of famous image </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Blue Mobile,</v>

3169
02:32:31.860 --> 02:32:36.290
<v Speaker 1>which is a NASA very high resolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>image that they did back in the nineties</v>

3170
02:32:36.800 --> 02:32:41.800
<v Speaker 1>from composites because they went to to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get something which had all of the </v>

3171
02:32:41.800 --> 02:32:42.400
<v Speaker 1>landmass without any clouds on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3172
02:32:42.720 --> 02:32:47.720
<v Speaker 1>So they have to take loads and loads of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pitches and just take the bits that had </v>

3173
02:32:47.720 --> 02:32:50.181
<v Speaker 1>no clouds on and then stitch them all </v>
<v Speaker 1>together and then they created this </v>

3174
02:32:50.181 --> 02:32:53.211
<v Speaker 1>thing and then they did a separate one </v>
<v Speaker 1>that had just the clouds and then they </v>

3175
02:32:53.211 --> 02:32:53.211
<v Speaker 1>can put them together and move them </v>
<v Speaker 1>around and stuff.</v>

3176
02:32:53.211 --> 02:32:56.400
<v Speaker 1>How many different satellites are taking</v>
<v Speaker 1>full earth images?</v>

3177
02:32:57.480 --> 02:33:02.340
<v Speaker 1>Probably around 30 or 40.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many of those are run by government?</v>

3178
02:33:02.341 --> 02:33:03.660
<v Speaker 1>Chills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A.</v>

3179
02:33:03.661 --> 02:33:08.661
<v Speaker 1>They're all run by government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually not all run by well are eight </v>

3180
02:33:08.661 --> 02:33:12.240
<v Speaker 1>is the Japanese one was a Russian one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is about the same.</v>

3181
02:33:12.340 --> 02:33:15.360
<v Speaker 1>Especially to Russian wounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a European one,</v>

3182
02:33:15.860 --> 02:33:20.860
<v Speaker 1>meteo sat and the American high </v>
<v Speaker 1>resolution one just went up a few months</v>

3183
02:33:22.620 --> 02:33:27.620
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's offline at the moment because the </v>

3184
02:33:27.620 --> 02:33:28.350
<v Speaker 1>moving it from one side of the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States to the other.</v>

3185
02:33:29.010 --> 02:33:30.000
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They moving it.</v>

3186
02:33:30.090 --> 02:33:32.280
<v Speaker 1>How long does that take?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A few days.</v>

3187
02:33:32.400 --> 02:33:34.820
<v Speaker 1>Jesus now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3188
02:33:34.980 --> 02:33:38.220
<v Speaker 1>How the fuck do they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Little little jets.</v>

3189
02:33:38.760 --> 02:33:39.630
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

3190
02:33:39.631 --> 02:33:42.030
<v Speaker 1>You've seen a gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3191
02:33:42.210 --> 02:33:47.210
<v Speaker 1>That's how things move around and get </v>
<v Speaker 1>things moving in a direction and then </v>

3192
02:33:47.210 --> 02:33:49.800
<v Speaker 1>sending them the anchor it in that spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's something that confuses people is</v>

3193
02:33:49.801 --> 02:33:51.720
<v Speaker 1>how to rockets work in space.</v>

3194
02:33:52.590 --> 02:33:54.930
<v Speaker 1>They think that because there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere in space,</v>

3195
02:33:54.931 --> 02:33:57.220
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing to push against.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

3196
02:33:57.300 --> 02:33:59.730
<v Speaker 1>So how does a rocket actually work in </v>
<v Speaker 1>space?</v>

3197
02:33:59.810 --> 02:34:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Or does it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's action and reaction.</v>

3198
02:34:03.000 --> 02:34:05.790
<v Speaker 1>If you throw something in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction,</v>

3199
02:34:05.970 --> 02:34:09.570
<v Speaker 1>you will move in the opposite direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say if you sit in your chair,</v>

3200
02:34:09.690 --> 02:34:13.080
<v Speaker 1>take a big bowling ball or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throw it in that direction really fast,</v>

3201
02:34:13.260 --> 02:34:16.370
<v Speaker 1>you'll move back a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you get like a,</v>

3202
02:34:16.640 --> 02:34:21.640
<v Speaker 1>an air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hose and you pointed us in that </v>

3203
02:34:21.640 --> 02:34:21.640
<v Speaker 1>direction and you're standing on ice or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something,</v>

3204
02:34:21.640 --> 02:34:23.460
<v Speaker 1>you will move in the opposite direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter if there's a.</v>

3205
02:34:23.860 --> 02:34:28.860
<v Speaker 1>If you throw something that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that has to be her reaction in the </v>

3206
02:34:28.860 --> 02:34:28.860
<v Speaker 1>opposite direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

3207
02:34:28.860 --> 02:34:30.370
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3208
02:34:30.610 --> 02:34:32.680
<v Speaker 1>a lot of those guys don't even believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>in satellites.</v>

3209
02:34:32.980 --> 02:34:33.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to.</v>

3210
02:34:34.010 --> 02:34:39.010
<v Speaker 1>Because how could they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think that they think that signals </v>

3211
02:34:39.010 --> 02:34:39.280
<v Speaker 1>are bounced off the ionosphere.</v>

3212
02:34:39.780 --> 02:34:41.530
<v Speaker 1>There's no satellite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3213
02:34:41.590 --> 02:34:43.330
<v Speaker 1>But you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see this adult lives.</v>

3214
02:34:43.690 --> 02:34:44.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see,</v>

3215
02:34:44.720 --> 02:34:49.720
<v Speaker 1>you can see the space station,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see it fly overhead and I get </v>

3216
02:34:49.720 --> 02:34:51.760
<v Speaker 1>emails whenever it is gonna fly overhead</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I go out and have a look and you can</v>

3217
02:34:51.761 --> 02:34:56.761
<v Speaker 1>see I've taken pictures of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see the solar panels and the </v>

3218
02:34:56.761 --> 02:34:56.761
<v Speaker 1>photographs that I've taken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3219
02:34:56.761 --> 02:35:01.230
<v Speaker 1>And it always appears exactly where </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily it's going to appear </v>

3220
02:35:01.230 --> 02:35:04.920
<v Speaker 1>anywhere in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the other problem with these </v>

3221
02:35:04.920 --> 02:35:05.890
<v Speaker 1>people that don't believe in satellites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>

3222
02:35:05.950 --> 02:35:10.950
<v Speaker 1>how are we tracking the weather then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do we know exactly when the </v>

3223
02:35:10.950 --> 02:35:11.200
<v Speaker 1>hurricane's coming in weather balloons?</v>

3224
02:35:13.930 --> 02:35:15.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's uh,</v>

3225
02:35:16.870 --> 02:35:20.830
<v Speaker 1>it's my concern about all this in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular,</v>

3226
02:35:20.831 --> 02:35:25.831
<v Speaker 1>like the flatter stuff is young kids </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasting their time on stupid shit when </v>

3227
02:35:26.411 --> 02:35:31.411
<v Speaker 1>the world is filled with massive real </v>
<v Speaker 1>mysteries and incredibly fascinating </v>

3228
02:35:32.621 --> 02:35:35.890
<v Speaker 1>things you should be diving in and </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning about.</v>

3229
02:35:36.040 --> 02:35:41.040
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a great opportunity for </v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching kids with things like flatter </v>

3230
02:35:41.040 --> 02:35:45.400
<v Speaker 1>you can do real experiments to determine</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the earth is not flat.</v>

3231
02:35:46.930 --> 02:35:50.080
<v Speaker 1>Maybe even more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>teaching them about traps.</v>

3232
02:35:50.290 --> 02:35:51.670
<v Speaker 1>Thinking trap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

3233
02:35:51.860 --> 02:35:55.530
<v Speaker 1>The mind can allow you to go down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can teach them how to debunk.</v>

3234
02:35:55.880 --> 02:35:59.920
<v Speaker 1>Say this guy is saying that ships should</v>
<v Speaker 1>reappear when we zoom in,</v>

3235
02:35:59.950 --> 02:36:03.100
<v Speaker 1>how do we test this and then they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>get out and tested it.</v>

3236
02:36:03.250 --> 02:36:05.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that that was.</v>

3237
02:36:05.770 --> 02:36:10.770
<v Speaker 1>That one was so stunningly stupid to me </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then I don't even want to go into </v>

3238
02:36:10.920 --> 02:36:14.560
<v Speaker 1>the flat earth thing anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's the thinking behind it.</v>

3239
02:36:14.590 --> 02:36:19.590
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thinking that every single airline </v>

3240
02:36:19.590 --> 02:36:24.330
<v Speaker 1>pilot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone involved in commercial </v>

3241
02:36:24.330 --> 02:36:26.830
<v Speaker 1>shipping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone involved in aerospace.</v>

3242
02:36:26.831 --> 02:36:28.940
<v Speaker 1>Everyone who makes satellites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone,</v>

3243
02:36:29.110 --> 02:36:31.660
<v Speaker 1>all those people are lying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every cartographer,</v>

3244
02:36:31.870 --> 02:36:33.730
<v Speaker 1>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the mapmakers,</v>

3245
02:36:33.790 --> 02:36:35.020
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all full of shit.</v>

3246
02:36:35.110 --> 02:36:39.220
<v Speaker 1>Everyone is agreed to not tell everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>else about the ice wall.</v>

3247
02:36:39.670 --> 02:36:41.650
<v Speaker 1>If the earth was flat and there was an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ice wall,</v>

3248
02:36:41.680 --> 02:36:46.680
<v Speaker 1>scientists with detail it and they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>explain why the earth was flat and they </v>

3249
02:36:46.680 --> 02:36:50.461
<v Speaker 1>would show you a working model of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth being flat and that's what they </v>

3250
02:36:50.461 --> 02:36:51.040
<v Speaker 1>would teach in school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There would be no.</v>

3251
02:36:51.430 --> 02:36:56.430
<v Speaker 1>There's no benefit whatsoever to </v>
<v Speaker 1>describing the earth in a shape that it </v>

3252
02:36:56.430 --> 02:37:01.140
<v Speaker 1>doesn't exist in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andy will be obvious that the earth was </v>

3253
02:37:01.140 --> 02:37:02.530
<v Speaker 1>flat because you can be able to do like </v>
<v Speaker 1>really simple tests yourself.</v>

3254
02:37:02.590 --> 02:37:05.400
<v Speaker 1>You see boats not going over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>horizon.</v>

3255
02:37:05.810 --> 02:37:10.810
<v Speaker 1>It's just so disturbing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would say the sun gets smaller as it </v>

3256
02:37:10.810 --> 02:37:13.951
<v Speaker 1>gets further away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Sun stays exactly the same size </v>

3257
02:37:13.951 --> 02:37:14.950
<v Speaker 1>throughout the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sunrise,</v>

3258
02:37:15.140 --> 02:37:16.130
<v Speaker 1>noon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sunset</v>

3259
02:37:16.460 --> 02:37:18.440
<v Speaker 2>at the same size of the moon does the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>

3260
02:37:18.500 --> 02:37:19.940
<v Speaker 2>Why does the moon look so much bigger </v>
<v Speaker 2>though?</v>

3261
02:37:19.941 --> 02:37:22.580
<v Speaker 2>When it's on the horizon with obstacle </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the optical illusion?</v>

3262
02:37:22.760 --> 02:37:27.230
<v Speaker 2>What is it is a perspective issue like </v>
<v Speaker 2>just the way your brain works.</v>

3263
02:37:27.260 --> 02:37:32.260
<v Speaker 2>If you take photographs of it like on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the horizon and then another photograph </v>

3264
02:37:32.260 --> 02:37:33.370
<v Speaker 2>of it when it's right up there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>compare them side by side,</v>

3265
02:37:33.371 --> 02:37:35.990
<v Speaker 2>they be the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same zoom settings is exactly the same,</v>

3266
02:37:36.050 --> 02:37:39.050
<v Speaker 2>but it's interesting because it really </v>
<v Speaker 2>does look larger when it gets lower.</v>

3267
02:37:39.110 --> 02:37:42.890
<v Speaker 2>It's purely psychological.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The harvest moon,</v>

3268
02:37:42.891 --> 02:37:45.440
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3269
02:37:45.680 --> 02:37:47.270
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the August man?</v>

3270
02:37:47.340 --> 02:37:52.340
<v Speaker 2>Not that big old red moon or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>as the blood moon eclipse at the beaver </v>

3271
02:37:53.421 --> 02:37:58.421
<v Speaker 2>moon to beaver moon that you would take </v>
<v Speaker 2>one didn't know about a beaver moon </v>

3272
02:37:59.290 --> 02:38:04.290
<v Speaker 2>until they said it was the super moon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is when the moon is just very </v>

3273
02:38:04.401 --> 02:38:04.880
<v Speaker 2>close to you.</v>

3274
02:38:05.270 --> 02:38:07.670
<v Speaker 2>What is the Super Moon?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much closer is a superman?</v>

3275
02:38:08.200 --> 02:38:10.220
<v Speaker 2>It's not much closer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>

3276
02:38:10.310 --> 02:38:13.930
<v Speaker 2>The eight actually only gets about eight</v>
<v Speaker 2>percent bigger than it.</v>

3277
02:38:13.931 --> 02:38:16.250
<v Speaker 2>Smallest is actually a very hard to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3278
02:38:16.251 --> 02:38:18.050
<v Speaker 2>It's actually any big ap put them side </v>
<v Speaker 2>by side.</v>

3279
02:38:19.370 --> 02:38:21.980
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But people and yeah,</v>

3280
02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:27.000
<v Speaker 2>you see these news stories about </v>
<v Speaker 2>superbowl and go look at the super moon </v>

3281
02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:27.000
<v Speaker 2>tonight when it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3282
02:38:27.320 --> 02:38:28.940
<v Speaker 2>it's not that much difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

3283
02:38:29.330 --> 02:38:30.950
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That looks a little bit different.</v>

3284
02:38:31.010 --> 02:38:36.010
<v Speaker 2>But that's the very smallest movement </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the very largest moon most of the </v>

3285
02:38:36.010 --> 02:38:36.010
<v Speaker 2>time it's going to be somewhere in </v>
<v Speaker 2>between that.</v>

3286
02:38:36.010 --> 02:38:37.550
<v Speaker 2>So you're not really going to notice the</v>
<v Speaker 2>difference.</v>

3287
02:38:38.860 --> 02:38:39.310
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then,</v>

3288
02:38:39.311 --> 02:38:41.960
<v Speaker 2>anything else we should cover before we </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrap this up?</v>

3289
02:38:44.630 --> 02:38:49.630
<v Speaker 2>Let me look at my list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to write lists because my memory </v>

3290
02:38:49.630 --> 02:38:49.630
<v Speaker 2>is so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

3291
02:38:49.810 --> 02:38:51.890
<v Speaker 2>I've offloaded everything like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3292
02:38:51.891 --> 02:38:56.891
<v Speaker 2>you're a standup comedians that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could have mail to memorize all this </v>

3293
02:38:56.891 --> 02:38:56.891
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

3294
02:38:56.891 --> 02:38:56.891
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only that,</v>

3295
02:38:56.891 --> 02:39:00.581
<v Speaker 3>I have to memorize fights to UFC </v>
<v Speaker 3>information in my head and I have comedy</v>

3296
02:39:00.951 --> 02:39:05.951
<v Speaker 3>information in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you asked me to do my act that I </v>

3297
02:39:05.951 --> 02:39:09.380
<v Speaker 3>did from last year like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I filmed for my netflix special.</v>

3298
02:39:09.440 --> 02:39:09.960
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't be able to</v>

3299
02:39:10.030 --> 02:39:11.490
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3300
02:39:11.540 --> 02:39:16.540
<v Speaker 2>Looking at my list and we've kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>covered most of the things that are on </v>

3301
02:39:16.540 --> 02:39:16.750
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could go over some like nine slash 11</v>

3302
02:39:16.751 --> 02:39:19.430
<v Speaker 2>crap if you wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm tired of it.</v>

3303
02:39:20.110 --> 02:39:22.450
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At this stage of my life,</v>

3304
02:39:22.480 --> 02:39:25.870
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it seems when there's so many incredible</v>

3305
02:39:25.871 --> 02:39:29.320
<v Speaker 3>things to pay attention to that a real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3306
02:39:29.650 --> 02:39:34.650
<v Speaker 3>this is what I feel like about all this </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff where people are looking into </v>

3307
02:39:34.650 --> 02:39:35.260
<v Speaker 3>conspiracies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're just nonsense.</v>

3308
02:39:35.261 --> 02:39:37.210
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're chasing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're chasing their tail.</v>

3309
02:39:37.570 --> 02:39:41.560
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to confirm something </v>
<v Speaker 3>where there's so much evidence that it's</v>

3310
02:39:41.561 --> 02:39:42.970
<v Speaker 3>not real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it just,</v>

3311
02:39:43.230 --> 02:39:48.230
<v Speaker 3>it really bothers me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It drives me nuts and I just don't </v>

3312
02:39:48.230 --> 02:39:48.700
<v Speaker 3>understand it and I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

3313
02:39:48.880 --> 02:39:51.880
<v Speaker 3>I wish that it wasn't a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish it wasn't an issue,</v>

3314
02:39:52.260 --> 02:39:57.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it is and it's one of the reasons </v>

3315
02:39:57.260 --> 02:39:59.701
<v Speaker 3>why I continue to talk about these </v>
<v Speaker 3>things and I really want to shine as </v>

3316
02:39:59.701 --> 02:40:01.140
<v Speaker 3>much light on them as possible so that </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

3317
02:40:02.080 --> 02:40:07.080
<v Speaker 3>there's a real pattern that you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>fall into and you can waste a tremendous</v>

3318
02:40:07.151 --> 02:40:12.151
<v Speaker 3>amount of time in your life if you start</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at things incorrectly and flat </v>

3319
02:40:12.891 --> 02:40:14.040
<v Speaker 3>earth me is the best</v>

3320
02:40:14.040 --> 02:40:19.040
<v Speaker 1>example of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the best example because it's so </v>

3321
02:40:19.040 --> 02:40:20.250
<v Speaker 1>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's so utterly preposterous that</v>

3322
02:40:20.251 --> 02:40:24.510
<v Speaker 1>everyone is lying and that there are no </v>
<v Speaker 1>images at all of this flatter,</v>
