17
00:00:17.221 --> 00:00:20.640
<v Speaker 1>Like I think the last time I saw you was there a,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

21
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.400
<v Speaker 1>but I always had a strange feeling about the place in which I'm starting to get</v>

22
00:00:29.401 --> 00:00:30.330
<v Speaker 1>over now,</v>

00:01:11.161 --> 00:01:14.820
<v Speaker 1>it was an open mic night and I only did five minutes,</v>

52
00:01:14.821 --> 00:01:17.610
<v Speaker 1>but there was a very famous comedian there.</v>

53
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

54

00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:30.230
<v Speaker 1>further my career would have gone if I would've just fucked it up.</v>
