WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Her low freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:03.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.070
<v Speaker 1>and the idea that I know,</v>

4
00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:09.660
<v Speaker 1>I know I lived in the city since I was 18 so I've been around gays for a quarter</v>

5
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.240
<v Speaker 1>century and I think of these guys I know that had been together for 10 years and</v>

6
00:00:12.241 --> 00:00:12.780
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

7
00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:13.650
<v Speaker 1>so let me get this straight,</v>

8
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:14.550
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

9
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.540
<v Speaker 1>these two are going to break up according to UN evangelical person and then</v>

10
00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:21.270
<v Speaker 1>they're just going to make out with some chick with blonde hair and eat her out</v>

11
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.860
<v Speaker 1>and like fuck her and have a boner and pray to God.</v>

12
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:26.723
<v Speaker 1>Come on.</v>

13
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.140
<v Speaker 1>You'd know that won't happen.</v>

14
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.400
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how much of homosexual behavior could be induced by molestation at an</v>

15
00:00:36.691 --> 00:00:37.471
<v Speaker 1>early age though.</v>

16
00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:37.741
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

17
00:00:37.741 --> 00:00:39.030
<v Speaker 1>that's the million dollar question.</v>

18
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.340
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be a real factor.</v>

19
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.881
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

20
00:00:41.881 --> 00:00:46.590
<v Speaker 1>and this is not the nine people that are born gay,</v>

21
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.630
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's a spectrum and I think there's most certainly some gay acts</v>

22
00:00:51.631 --> 00:00:56.631
<v Speaker 1>that are committed on young people and horrifically those people tend to on a</v>

23
00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.390
<v Speaker 1>pretty frequent basis do the same thing to other young kids.</v>

24
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.280
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird in in,</v>

25
00:01:04.281 --> 00:01:07.680
<v Speaker 1>in terms of like the victims becoming the victimizer.</v>

26
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.251
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

27
00:01:08.251 --> 00:01:09.360
<v Speaker 1>I know where you're going with this.</v>

28
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.040
<v Speaker 1>We're walking into the elephant in the room,</v>

29
00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:11.551
<v Speaker 1>but what kind of,</v>

30
00:01:11.551 --> 00:01:12.061
<v Speaker 1>not even,</v>

31
00:01:12.061 --> 00:01:13.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean just just talking about,</v>

32
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.560
<v Speaker 1>I was listening to the George to Chi interview today because they're trying to</v>

33
00:01:16.561 --> 00:01:19.560
<v Speaker 1>pull up everybody now that the Milo thing is out there,</v>

34
00:01:19.561 --> 00:01:24.510
<v Speaker 1>they're pulling up everybody who in any way it has condoned sex with underage</v>

35
00:01:24.511 --> 00:01:25.344
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

36
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:29.490
<v Speaker 1>And George to Kai was talking about his own experiences in camp and it was on</v>

37
00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:33.600
<v Speaker 1>the stern show and he was just talking about w what he,</v>

38
00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.550
<v Speaker 1>the way he was describing it as a positive experience with a,</v>

39
00:01:37.551 --> 00:01:40.140
<v Speaker 1>a kid who was in his late teens,</v>

40
00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:44.400
<v Speaker 1>I think he said it was 19 and he was like 13 somewhere in that age.</v>

41
00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:45.361
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

42
00:01:45.361 --> 00:01:48.090
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely child molestation.</v>

43
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.590
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely illegal.</v>

44
00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.570
<v Speaker 1>But the way he was describing it,</v>

45
00:01:51.571 --> 00:01:55.440
<v Speaker 1>he was pretty much describing it as a positive experience.</v>

46
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

47
00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.310
<v Speaker 1>Which when it's your experience,</v>

48
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's illegal.</v>

49
00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:03.540
<v Speaker 1>The guy did something that was against the law.</v>

50
00:02:03.541 --> 00:02:05.250
<v Speaker 1>But boy,</v>

51
00:02:05.251 --> 00:02:08.640
<v Speaker 1>that's a weird area because it's his experience.</v>

52
00:02:08.641 --> 00:02:09.720
<v Speaker 1>And he was talking about,</v>

53
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:10.380
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

54
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.750
<v Speaker 1>well here's the deal and this is a mistake Milo made.</v>

55
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.550
<v Speaker 1>You have to acknowledge that what you're talking about is fucked up and horrible</v>

56
00:02:17.551 --> 00:02:18.384
<v Speaker 1>and wrong,</v>

57
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.390
<v Speaker 1>but you just so happen to have not had a bad experience within those parameters.</v>

58
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:27.960
<v Speaker 1>Like say you were raped as a woman and you came,</v>

59
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.910
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

60
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:29.310
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

61
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.500
<v Speaker 1>which by the way happens for some strange reason.</v>

62
00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:33.600
<v Speaker 1>So if you're one of those women and you're about to say that,</v>

63
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.440
<v Speaker 1>you have to understand that we're going into a very dangerous place right now.</v>

64
00:02:37.441 --> 00:02:38.274
<v Speaker 1>And you can't say,</v>

65
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.611
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

66
00:02:38.611 --> 00:02:41.040
<v Speaker 1>some rapes are absolutely fabulous and women have come from them.</v>

67
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.120
<v Speaker 1>You have to say,</v>

68
00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.530
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking horrible.</v>

69
00:02:43.531 --> 00:02:44.221
<v Speaker 1>Rape is evil.</v>

70
00:02:44.221 --> 00:02:47.540
<v Speaker 1>But I buy some weird freak of nature actually liked,</v>

71
00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:48.571
<v Speaker 1>or a murderer.</v>

72
00:02:48.571 --> 00:02:50.490
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's times when you murdered a guy and he ended up,</v>

73
00:02:50.491 --> 00:02:52.320
<v Speaker 1>he was a mass murder and it was a good murder,</v>

74
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

75
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:53.041
<v Speaker 1>And you go,</v>

76
00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:53.311
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

77
00:02:53.311 --> 00:02:53.500
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

78
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm describing a murder.</v>

79
00:02:54.481 --> 00:02:55.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm not condoning murderer.</v>

80
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.480
<v Speaker 1>But in this weird case,</v>

81
00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.343
<v Speaker 1>it worked.</v>

82
00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.830
<v Speaker 1>And Milo's mistake was,</v>

83
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:04.831
<v Speaker 1>he said it worked for me and then he implied that it could work for a ton of</v>

84
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:06.640
<v Speaker 1>other gays to be fucked at 13.</v>

85
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:07.690
<v Speaker 1>Well he did that,</v>

86
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:08.120
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

87
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.550
<v Speaker 1>drunken peasants podcast and his take on it from a drunken peasants was</v>

88
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.620
<v Speaker 1>different than his take on it from mine.</v>

89
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.420
<v Speaker 1>And on my podcast it seemed more like he was trying to make light of something</v>

90
00:03:19.421 --> 00:03:22.210
<v Speaker 1>that most likely definitely did happen to him.</v>

91
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.200
<v Speaker 1>The father Michael thing.</v>

92
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.513
<v Speaker 1>So there's two,</v>

93
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.850
<v Speaker 1>there's the father Michael thing and I don't know if I believe that.</v>

94
00:03:27.851 --> 00:03:28.241
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>

95
00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:28.780
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

96
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.670
<v Speaker 1>I've heard him say that joke a few times where he's like,</v>

97
00:03:30.671 --> 00:03:33.160
<v Speaker 1>I'd never would have given such good head if it wasn't for Father Michael.</v>

98
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.671
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

99
00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:36.940
<v Speaker 1>So you think that might be something like that he's constructed?</v>

100
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.901
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe it.</v>

101
00:03:37.901 --> 00:03:38.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why.</v>

102
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:39.363
<v Speaker 1>That's just my gut.</v>

103
00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.630
<v Speaker 1>And then the other thing was condoning sexual relationships with 13 year olds</v>

104
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:44.110
<v Speaker 1>and he said,</v>

105
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.400
<v Speaker 1>especially in the gay world,</v>

106
00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.530
<v Speaker 1>now I know of straight guys who were a straight guy,</v>

107
00:03:49.531 --> 00:03:52.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking of in particular who was molested at camp.</v>

108
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.940
<v Speaker 1>And it was by an older gay camp counselor.</v>

109
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 1>This guy thinks of that guy every day,</v>

110
00:03:57.671 --> 00:03:59.380
<v Speaker 1>falls him on linkedin hoping he'll die.</v>

111
00:03:59.381 --> 00:04:00.250
<v Speaker 1>He wants to murder him.</v>

112
00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:01.270
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

113
00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.890
<v Speaker 1>so the problem with what Milo said is you end up normalizing this behavior and</v>

114
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:07.330
<v Speaker 1>say it's okay if in the gay world,</v>

115
00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:08.500
<v Speaker 1>next thing you know,</v>

116
00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:10.270
<v Speaker 1>some older gay who's at Camp Goes,</v>

117
00:04:10.271 --> 00:04:10.421
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

118
00:04:10.421 --> 00:04:12.460
<v Speaker 1>this is probably a fag that I'm blowing.</v>

119
00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.890
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

120
00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:13.900
<v Speaker 1>So this is okay.</v>

121
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

122
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:16.690
<v Speaker 1>So what I say to these gays,</v>

123
00:04:16.691 --> 00:04:17.920
<v Speaker 1>these 13 year old gates to go,</v>

124
00:04:17.921 --> 00:04:19.840
<v Speaker 1>I would be okay with fucking a 29 year old.</v>

125
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.321
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

126
00:04:20.321 --> 00:04:20.621
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

127
00:04:20.621 --> 00:04:21.454
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

128
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.490
<v Speaker 1>but we're not normalizing that because the vast,</v>

129
00:04:24.491 --> 00:04:27.040
<v Speaker 1>vast majority of times it doesn't turn out well.</v>

130
00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:27.993
<v Speaker 1>So No.</v>

131
00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.721
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

132
00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:30.250
<v Speaker 1>that's a very good way of putting it,</v>

133
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.911
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

134
00:04:30.911 --> 00:04:31.744
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

135
00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.000
<v Speaker 1>it's really disturbed.</v>

136
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.390
<v Speaker 1>Well done.</v>

137
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.370
<v Speaker 1>The Milo thing is so odd because first of all,</v>

138
00:04:36.371 --> 00:04:41.371
<v Speaker 1>I think he's got this act and let's call it an act cause part of it has got to</v>

139
00:04:41.531 --> 00:04:41.980
<v Speaker 1>be an act.</v>

140
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.950
<v Speaker 1>He's got a wide spectrum of his personalities.</v>

141
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.300
<v Speaker 1>So on Bill Maher,</v>

142
00:04:46.301 --> 00:04:50.320
<v Speaker 1>he can be a raging Liberace queen with pearls on dress like a woman.</v>

143
00:04:50.321 --> 00:04:50.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

144
00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:51.340
<v Speaker 1>just like a woman.</v>

145
00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

146
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:53.590
<v Speaker 1>Camper than any woman I know.</v>

147
00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

148
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:55.810
<v Speaker 1>And then for the apology,</v>

149
00:04:55.811 --> 00:04:57.940
<v Speaker 1>he's the conservative with the coke bottle glasses.</v>

150
00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:58.803
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

151
00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.370
<v Speaker 1>It's sorta like when a Jamaican goes back to Jamaica and they start speaking in</v>

152
00:05:03.371 --> 00:05:03.970
<v Speaker 1>Patois,</v>

153
00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.970
<v Speaker 1>like their grandmother and not necessarily lying.</v>

154
00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.430
<v Speaker 1>It's just a wide range of use.</v>

155
00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:10.061
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

156
00:05:10.061 --> 00:05:11.730
<v Speaker 1>He plays it up and there is,</v>

157
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.650
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely a performance piece to a lot of what he does.</v>

158
00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.370
<v Speaker 1>What's,</v>

159
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.420
<v Speaker 1>what's really interesting is he's very good at riling people up.</v>

160
00:05:19.421 --> 00:05:21.790
<v Speaker 1>He's obviously very good at getting people upset.</v>

161
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:22.000
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

162
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.320
<v Speaker 1>and in doing so,</v>

163
00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.830
<v Speaker 1>he's created these sort of false narratives about him,</v>

164
00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.180
<v Speaker 1>that he's a Nazi,</v>

165
00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.310
<v Speaker 1>that he promotes genocide.</v>

166
00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.971
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

167
00:05:30.971 --> 00:05:33.640
<v Speaker 1>there were so many people outside the Berkeley thing that were screaming,</v>

168
00:05:33.641 --> 00:05:38.641
<v Speaker 1>calling them a Nazi and saying he's a fascist when they in fact were behaving in</v>

169
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.520
<v Speaker 1>very authoritarian,</v>

170
00:05:42.521 --> 00:05:43.870
<v Speaker 1>fascist ways.</v>

171
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:44.660
<v Speaker 1>That's Antifa.</v>

172
00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:45.041
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

173
00:05:45.041 --> 00:05:45.371
<v Speaker 1>you said,</v>

174
00:05:45.371 --> 00:05:46.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what Antifa is.</v>

175
00:05:46.391 --> 00:05:49.430
<v Speaker 1>That's those guys antifascist is that what Antifa stands for?</v>

176
00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.720
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

177
00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.201
<v Speaker 1>But you're right,</v>

178
00:05:50.201 --> 00:05:51.940
<v Speaker 1>they're terrorists and they use terror.</v>

179
00:05:51.941 --> 00:05:54.100
<v Speaker 1>They use violence to achieve political gains,</v>

180
00:05:54.101 --> 00:05:56.830
<v Speaker 1>which is terrorism and a these people,</v>

181
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:02.350
<v Speaker 1>it's not like Milo ever set or Trump even ever said anything that is remotely</v>

182
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:03.650
<v Speaker 1>close to genocide,</v>

183
00:06:03.651 --> 00:06:04.880
<v Speaker 1>but those guys just go.</v>

184
00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:09.320
<v Speaker 1>Anyone that wants to enforce immigration laws is a fucking Nazi.</v>

185
00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.020
<v Speaker 1>So I need violence cause I'm trying to stop Hitler.</v>

186
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:14.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm around the first stages of Hitler,</v>

187
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.760
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going back in time and strangling him in his crib.</v>

188
00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:17.510
<v Speaker 1>Kind of dry.</v>

189
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.841
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

190
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:22.730
<v Speaker 1>But the problem is the way they're reacting to it is the absolute wrong way to</v>

191
00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:25.550
<v Speaker 1>react to someone who sang something that you don't agree with.</v>

192
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:26.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

193
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:31.150
<v Speaker 1>The the right way is to say something that you feel opposes what they're saying.</v>

194
00:06:31.701 --> 00:06:33.590
<v Speaker 1>It makes more sense to debate them.</v>

195
00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:34.790
<v Speaker 1>That's the beauty of free speech.</v>

196
00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.320
<v Speaker 1>Like it has no limits.</v>

197
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:39.140
<v Speaker 1>If you want to get out there and deny the Holocaust,</v>

198
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:42.110
<v Speaker 1>you want to get out there and sexualized toddlers.</v>

199
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:43.520
<v Speaker 1>I'll go to your talk.</v>

200
00:06:43.521 --> 00:06:44.031
<v Speaker 1>I want to hear it.</v>

201
00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:45.410
<v Speaker 1>And then in the Q and a,</v>

202
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:46.730
<v Speaker 1>I'll shoot you down.</v>

203
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:47.001
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

204
00:06:47.001 --> 00:06:47.211
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

205
00:06:47.211 --> 00:06:49.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he even should just be a Q and a.</v>

206
00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:50.271
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

207
00:06:50.271 --> 00:06:52.730
<v Speaker 1>I think it should be real clear other there,</v>

208
00:06:52.731 --> 00:06:54.100
<v Speaker 1>there should be someone and they,</v>

209
00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:57.920
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't just rely on the audience to come up with some sort of a response.</v>

210
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.300
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're going to have someone as controversial as Milo and you are so</v>

211
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:06.500
<v Speaker 1>opposed to it that you're willing to throw bricks through Starbucks windows and</v>

212
00:07:06.501 --> 00:07:07.790
<v Speaker 1>light cop cars on fire,</v>

213
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.360
<v Speaker 1>there should be someone that can speak for your side,</v>

214
00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:11.691
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

215
00:07:11.691 --> 00:07:13.370
<v Speaker 1>and then you should organize some sort of a talk.</v>

216
00:07:13.371 --> 00:07:16.160
<v Speaker 1>But this is setting it up the wrong way because you go,</v>

217
00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:18.380
<v Speaker 1>it's like someone said to me once,</v>

218
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:18.981
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

219
00:07:18.981 --> 00:07:19.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

220
00:07:19.101 --> 00:07:20.560
<v Speaker 1>like we were talking about martial arts flows,</v>

221
00:07:20.561 --> 00:07:21.081
<v Speaker 1>black belt,</v>

222
00:07:21.081 --> 00:07:22.340
<v Speaker 1>I'd fucking kick everybody's ass.</v>

223
00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:22.421
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

224
00:07:22.421 --> 00:07:22.761
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

225
00:07:22.761 --> 00:07:23.420
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't.</v>

226
00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:23.571
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

227
00:07:23.571 --> 00:07:23.871
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't.</v>

228
00:07:23.871 --> 00:07:24.171
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

229
00:07:24.171 --> 00:07:27.110
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't because you'd have discipline and you'd realize the consequences of</v>

230
00:07:27.111 --> 00:07:27.201
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

231
00:07:27.201 --> 00:07:28.034
<v Speaker 1>But second of all,</v>

232
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.510
<v Speaker 1>when you just kick someone's ass,</v>

233
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:30.590
<v Speaker 1>they don't,</v>

234
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:34.310
<v Speaker 1>they don't just take it like they come back with a bat or a gun or their</v>

235
00:07:34.311 --> 00:07:34.761
<v Speaker 1>brother,</v>

236
00:07:34.761 --> 00:07:35.540
<v Speaker 1>he started fighting.</v>

237
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:39.230
<v Speaker 1>They want to get it back and it goes back and forth and back and forth and all</v>

238
00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:42.290
<v Speaker 1>conflict pretty much goes that way.</v>

239
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:46.010
<v Speaker 1>You have conflict and then someone responds to that conflict and it escalates.</v>

240
00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:49.310
<v Speaker 1>So if you have this thing where you start throwing bricks through windows and</v>

241
00:07:49.311 --> 00:07:52.820
<v Speaker 1>lighting cop cars on fire in stopping people from talking and hitting people</v>

242
00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.340
<v Speaker 1>that have a make bitcoin great again,</v>

243
00:07:55.341 --> 00:07:58.580
<v Speaker 1>hats and just see that girl got maced in the face by a 60 year olds.</v>

244
00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:01.010
<v Speaker 1>Eventually people show up with guns.</v>

245
00:08:01.310 --> 00:08:02.330
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens.</v>

246
00:08:02.450 --> 00:08:05.420
<v Speaker 1>This is what happens when you keep escalating the violence.</v>

247
00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.130
<v Speaker 1>You become a them.</v>

248
00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:08.780
<v Speaker 1>You become the other,</v>

249
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:13.840
<v Speaker 1>you become the enemy and you create this polarizing atmosphere that's so intense</v>

250
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:18.290
<v Speaker 1>that no dialogue kind of fix it now because you're the enemy.</v>

251
00:08:18.291 --> 00:08:20.030
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about the north versus the south.</v>

252
00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:20.320
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

253
00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.290
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about,</v>

254
00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:21.911
<v Speaker 1>you know the,</v>

255
00:08:21.911 --> 00:08:23.510
<v Speaker 1>the Protestants versus the Catholics.</v>

256
00:08:23.511 --> 00:08:23.661
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

257
00:08:23.661 --> 00:08:23.901
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

258
00:08:23.901 --> 00:08:28.901
<v Speaker 1>you create this horrific environment where almost it's almost impossible to</v>

259
00:08:30.561 --> 00:08:31.400
<v Speaker 1>avoid violence.</v>

260
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:32.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

261
00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:33.500
<v Speaker 1>so I'm done avoiding it.</v>

262
00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:34.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm taking the low road.</v>

263
00:08:34.701 --> 00:08:35.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm punching them in the face.</v>

264
00:08:35.811 --> 00:08:37.130
<v Speaker 1>So that's what you're doing with this outfit?</v>

265
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.293
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

266
00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:40.080
<v Speaker 1>That is really what I'm doing stuff.</v>

267
00:08:40.081 --> 00:08:41.300
<v Speaker 1>But I did a talk at Nyu.</v>

268
00:08:41.301 --> 00:08:42.230
<v Speaker 1>They pepper sprayed me.</v>

269
00:08:42.470 --> 00:08:43.010
<v Speaker 1>Did they read,</v>

270
00:08:43.010 --> 00:08:43.760
<v Speaker 1>when was this?</v>

271
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.320
<v Speaker 1>This was a couple of weeks ago.</v>

272
00:08:45.410 --> 00:08:45.711
<v Speaker 1>What did,</v>

273
00:08:45.711 --> 00:08:46.610
<v Speaker 1>what was it talk about?</v>

274
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:47.990
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even have a plan.</v>

275
00:08:47.991 --> 00:08:48.550
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

276
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:50.850
<v Speaker 1>they know me as pro Trump or something and they,</v>

277
00:08:51.010 --> 00:08:53.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm a Nazi because of that and they should,</v>

278
00:08:53.130 --> 00:08:54.950
<v Speaker 1>they don't want to give a platform to free.</v>

279
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:59.880
<v Speaker 1>That's the irony of all this is they pretend that it's gotten so far.</v>

280
00:08:59.881 --> 00:09:02.340
<v Speaker 1>It's beyond debate now in their world.</v>

281
00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:06.570
<v Speaker 1>We are recruiting fascists for some sort of imminent genocide.</v>

282
00:09:06.571 --> 00:09:11.250
<v Speaker 1>So we're like signing up the brown shirts with a form at our talks and you go</v>

283
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.380
<v Speaker 1>say that was possible.</v>

284
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:14.543
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

285
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:15.600
<v Speaker 1>how does that work?</v>

286
00:09:15.601 --> 00:09:16.560
<v Speaker 1>Like we sign you up,</v>

287
00:09:16.561 --> 00:09:17.970
<v Speaker 1>then you're part of the club.</v>

288
00:09:17.971 --> 00:09:19.890
<v Speaker 1>Then you come with us on the next genocide.</v>

289
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.210
<v Speaker 1>The fuck are you talking about?</v>

290
00:09:21.211 --> 00:09:24.090
<v Speaker 1>You haven't even played it through in your mind because for these people it's a</v>

291
00:09:24.091 --> 00:09:24.600
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>

292
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:26.370
<v Speaker 1>That's why they don't want to debate.</v>

293
00:09:26.371 --> 00:09:27.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like a born again.</v>

294
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:29.490
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't want a debate about the existence of God.</v>

295
00:09:29.491 --> 00:09:31.170
<v Speaker 1>He's already on that side.</v>

296
00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:34.020
<v Speaker 1>So what was your plan when you went there?</v>

297
00:09:34.021 --> 00:09:34.411
<v Speaker 1>What did,</v>

298
00:09:34.411 --> 00:09:35.340
<v Speaker 1>what did you want to talk?</v>

299
00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:36.510
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say,</v>

300
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:37.410
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

301
00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.090
<v Speaker 1>this Nazi that,</v>

302
00:09:39.091 --> 00:09:39.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

303
00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:43.050
<v Speaker 1>that you've made Milo and I out to be who wants genocide and who,</v>

304
00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:43.350
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

305
00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:45.670
<v Speaker 1>sees nonwhites is inhuman,</v>

306
00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:45.911
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

307
00:09:45.911 --> 00:09:46.031
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

308
00:09:46.031 --> 00:09:46.171
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

309
00:09:46.171 --> 00:09:46.291
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

310
00:09:46.291 --> 00:09:46.680
<v Speaker 1>blah,</v>

311
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.431
<v Speaker 1>homophobic,</v>

312
00:09:47.431 --> 00:09:47.881
<v Speaker 1>sexist,</v>

313
00:09:47.881 --> 00:09:48.714
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

314
00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:49.703
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

315
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:50.911
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

316
00:09:50.911 --> 00:09:53.550
<v Speaker 1>that guy should be allowed to talk if he existed,</v>

317
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:54.930
<v Speaker 1>but he doesn't exist.</v>

318
00:09:55.530 --> 00:10:00.180
<v Speaker 1>Your monster is a mythical beast and you've gone to college,</v>

319
00:10:00.181 --> 00:10:04.020
<v Speaker 1>you're 60 grand in debt already to fight this mythical beast who doesn't fucking</v>

320
00:10:04.021 --> 00:10:04.680
<v Speaker 1>exist?</v>

321
00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:04.861
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

322
00:10:04.861 --> 00:10:05.581
<v Speaker 1>in terms of Milo,</v>

323
00:10:05.581 --> 00:10:06.810
<v Speaker 1>he definitely doesn't exist.</v>

324
00:10:06.811 --> 00:10:08.250
<v Speaker 1>Milo is not a Nazi.</v>

325
00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.001
<v Speaker 1>He's definitely,</v>

326
00:10:09.001 --> 00:10:10.470
<v Speaker 1>he's not promoting genocide.</v>

327
00:10:10.471 --> 00:10:13.200
<v Speaker 1>And those are two things that just get trumpeted about left and right.</v>

328
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:14.130
<v Speaker 1>Exactly who is,</v>

329
00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:18.480
<v Speaker 1>but Milo has said some very inflammatory things about,</v>

330
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:23.540
<v Speaker 1>and in a very generalizing way about women and about the wage gap and about all</v>

331
00:10:24.391 --> 00:10:25.410
<v Speaker 1>sorts of things that he,</v>

332
00:10:25.411 --> 00:10:30.390
<v Speaker 1>he designs his words and his phrases to be inflammatory.</v>

333
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:33.900
<v Speaker 1>So he gets the most response and it's been incredibly profitable.</v>

334
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.141
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

335
00:10:34.141 --> 00:10:35.850
<v Speaker 1>up until Harper Collins pulled his book deal,</v>

336
00:10:35.851 --> 00:10:38.220
<v Speaker 1>he had a $250,000 book advance.</v>

337
00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.230
<v Speaker 1>His book was number one on Amazon.</v>

338
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.780
<v Speaker 1>Just sheerly through controversy.</v>

339
00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:43.350
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

340
00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean through presales and controversy.</v>

341
00:10:45.541 --> 00:10:50.541
<v Speaker 1>So it's a strategy and a lot of ways and it's also a response to this really</v>

342
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:56.990
<v Speaker 1>hard stance that the far left is taking this anti anti free speech stance.</v>

343
00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:58.231
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

344
00:10:58.231 --> 00:10:59.550
<v Speaker 1>But always with these cases you go,</v>

345
00:10:59.551 --> 00:11:00.780
<v Speaker 1>what exactly did he say?</v>

346
00:11:00.781 --> 00:11:02.110
<v Speaker 1>I always say this to people who bitch about it.</v>

347
00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:02.550
<v Speaker 1>And Coulter,</v>

348
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:03.030
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

349
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:06.090
<v Speaker 1>what sentence in what book is factually incorrect?</v>

350
00:11:06.091 --> 00:11:07.230
<v Speaker 1>What specifically are you saying?</v>

351
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:08.520
<v Speaker 1>And with this Milo thing,</v>

352
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:13.790
<v Speaker 1>he said that often sexual relationships with 13 year olds can be beneficial for</v>

353
00:11:15.241 --> 00:11:16.074
<v Speaker 1>gays.</v>

354
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:16.381
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

355
00:11:16.381 --> 00:11:18.720
<v Speaker 1>he has since retracted that and apologized,</v>

356
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.340
<v Speaker 1>but that's not enough.</v>

357
00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:21.750
<v Speaker 1>And that's about as,</v>

358
00:11:21.751 --> 00:11:22.920
<v Speaker 1>as egregious as it gets.</v>

359
00:11:22.921 --> 00:11:24.390
<v Speaker 1>The other stuff that he says,</v>

360
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:29.750
<v Speaker 1>we all say in a joking way and then that becomes pure evil and you advocate for</v>

361
00:11:30.571 --> 00:11:31.050
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

362
00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:31.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

363
00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.140
<v Speaker 1>So they,</v>

364
00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:35.520
<v Speaker 1>the left is willfully ignorant of humor when it comes to Milo.</v>

365
00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:36.550
<v Speaker 1>And with Trump too,</v>

366
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:36.900
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

367
00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:39.660
<v Speaker 1>within culture is doing is very similar to what Milo is doing.</v>

368
00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.060
<v Speaker 1>You mean their,</v>

369
00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:44.010
<v Speaker 1>their merchants of outrage and that's what they're doing.</v>

370
00:11:44.011 --> 00:11:44.671
<v Speaker 1>I disagree.</v>

371
00:11:44.671 --> 00:11:46.800
<v Speaker 1>I think they're speaking in a hyperbolic tone.</v>

372
00:11:46.801 --> 00:11:47.790
<v Speaker 1>They're flamboyant,</v>

373
00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:49.740
<v Speaker 1>but that's what the charter was still there.</v>

374
00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:50.260
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

375
00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:50.610
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

376
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:52.200
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely some truth,</v>

377
00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:55.030
<v Speaker 1>especially with Milo that some of the things that he says,</v>

378
00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:56.110
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

379
00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:56.891
<v Speaker 1>but all truth.</v>

380
00:11:56.891 --> 00:11:57.081
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

381
00:11:57.081 --> 00:11:57.251
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

382
00:11:57.251 --> 00:11:58.120
<v Speaker 1>Like again,</v>

383
00:11:58.121 --> 00:11:58.871
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying it right now.</v>

384
00:11:58.871 --> 00:11:59.191
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

385
00:11:59.191 --> 00:12:01.150
<v Speaker 1>what did he say this factually incorrect?</v>

386
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:01.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

387
00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:02.830
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't a joke,</v>

388
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:03.191
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

389
00:12:03.191 --> 00:12:04.720
<v Speaker 1>not factually incorrect,</v>

390
00:12:04.721 --> 00:12:09.610
<v Speaker 1>but extremely offensive to people like the 13 year old boy comment.</v>

391
00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:14.700
<v Speaker 1>Like the thing about sort of normalizing relationships between grown men and 13</v>

392
00:12:14.861 --> 00:12:15.560
<v Speaker 1>year old boys.</v>

393
00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:15.970
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

394
00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:16.331
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

395
00:12:16.331 --> 00:12:21.070
<v Speaker 1>I think a big part of why he even says that is because he's in many ways like a</v>

396
00:12:21.071 --> 00:12:26.071
<v Speaker 1>natural contrarian and in many ways a guy who wants to get a rise out of people.</v>

397
00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:30.520
<v Speaker 1>And by saying that he didn't feel like there's any consequences to being</v>

398
00:12:30.521 --> 00:12:31.990
<v Speaker 1>outrageous in that regard.</v>

399
00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:35.590
<v Speaker 1>But I think we could both agree whether or not it's factual.</v>

400
00:12:35.591 --> 00:12:36.550
<v Speaker 1>In his case,</v>

401
00:12:37.180 --> 00:12:38.860
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucked up thing to say.</v>

402
00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.560
<v Speaker 1>It was a fucked up thing to say it was negligent,</v>

403
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:41.850
<v Speaker 1>which is why I apologize.</v>

404
00:12:41.851 --> 00:12:46.320
<v Speaker 1>But I think the grain of truth to that and with his other statements is a lot</v>

405
00:12:46.321 --> 00:12:47.160
<v Speaker 1>more than a grain,</v>

406
00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.200
<v Speaker 1>but the grain of truth to what he was saying.</v>

407
00:12:49.201 --> 00:12:52.320
<v Speaker 1>His gaze have less chastity then straights.</v>

408
00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:54.390
<v Speaker 1>And if a woman is known as a slut,</v>

409
00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:55.950
<v Speaker 1>she's less likely to be picked up.</v>

410
00:12:55.951 --> 00:12:58.140
<v Speaker 1>And I've been sued for calling a woman a slut.</v>

411
00:12:58.170 --> 00:12:58.830
<v Speaker 1>Where are you really?</v>

412
00:12:58.830 --> 00:12:59.370
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

413
00:12:59.370 --> 00:13:00.203
<v Speaker 1>Who Sued you?</v>

414
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:01.021
<v Speaker 1>It was a long time ago.</v>

415
00:13:01.021 --> 00:13:01.801
<v Speaker 1>Back in vice days.</v>

416
00:13:01.801 --> 00:13:03.720
<v Speaker 1>It was in to do's and don'ts and the,</v>

417
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.640
<v Speaker 1>the way the law is,</v>

418
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:06.780
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of antiquated,</v>

419
00:13:06.781 --> 00:13:07.200
<v Speaker 1>but it's like,</v>

420
00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:11.940
<v Speaker 1>oh you called her a slut now she won't have currency in the market of marriage</v>

421
00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.350
<v Speaker 1>cause she's known as a whore.</v>

422
00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:16.740
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to punish you punitively for this sin.</v>

423
00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:18.173
<v Speaker 1>Did you have to settle?</v>

424
00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:18.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

425
00:13:18.770 --> 00:13:19.603
<v Speaker 1>God dammit.</v>

426
00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:21.450
<v Speaker 1>You can't even call someone a slut.</v>

427
00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:25.170
<v Speaker 1>There's no word for a man.</v>

428
00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:26.310
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

429
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:27.090
<v Speaker 1>A cad.</v>

430
00:13:27.090 --> 00:13:27.811
<v Speaker 1>That's a compliment.</v>

431
00:13:27.811 --> 00:13:28.621
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>

432
00:13:28.621 --> 00:13:28.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

433
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:30.060
<v Speaker 1>A cat is hilarious.</v>

434
00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:30.241
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

435
00:13:30.241 --> 00:13:32.940
<v Speaker 1>the fact that there's no equivalent for a man shows you that there's a different</v>

436
00:13:32.941 --> 00:13:33.271
<v Speaker 1>standard.</v>

437
00:13:33.271 --> 00:13:38.271
<v Speaker 1>And then with gays it is different to like 13 year old and an older person,</v>

438
00:13:39.241 --> 00:13:39.750
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

439
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:41.880
<v Speaker 1>If it's a girl and a 40 year old teacher,</v>

440
00:13:41.881 --> 00:13:45.510
<v Speaker 1>I want to take him to the parking lot and beat him until he has a weird walks.</v>

441
00:13:45.511 --> 00:13:46.620
<v Speaker 1>Weird for the rest of his life.</v>

442
00:13:46.950 --> 00:13:48.630
<v Speaker 1>If it's a woman in a boy,</v>

443
00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:49.411
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

444
00:13:49.411 --> 00:13:50.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to murder her.</v>

445
00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:52.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm grossed out 13,</v>

446
00:13:52.801 --> 00:13:55.470
<v Speaker 1>especially 14 little better.</v>

447
00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:57.540
<v Speaker 1>And then with gays,</v>

448
00:13:58.050 --> 00:13:58.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

449
00:13:58.870 --> 00:14:01.290
<v Speaker 1>well I'm not gonna make the same mistake Milo made right now.</v>

450
00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.000
<v Speaker 1>Don't ever do it.</v>

451
00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.530
<v Speaker 1>But if a gaze,</v>

452
00:14:04.531 --> 00:14:05.940
<v Speaker 1>no one has a sled in the future,</v>

453
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:07.800
<v Speaker 1>like say a 19 year old fucks,</v>

454
00:14:07.801 --> 00:14:09.630
<v Speaker 1>200 people as a woman,</v>

455
00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:11.970
<v Speaker 1>no one wants to go near as a gay.</v>

456
00:14:12.660 --> 00:14:13.650
<v Speaker 1>You've been around the block.</v>

457
00:14:14.730 --> 00:14:14.891
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

458
00:14:14.891 --> 00:14:16.690
<v Speaker 1>there's not the same consequences for sure.</v>

459
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:17.241
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>

460
00:14:17.241 --> 00:14:18.970
<v Speaker 1>I had a bit of my act about,</v>

461
00:14:18.971 --> 00:14:20.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you remember this commercial,</v>

462
00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:25.720
<v Speaker 1>but there was a commercial adjust for men commercial where there was a baby that</v>

463
00:14:25.721 --> 00:14:26.950
<v Speaker 1>was driving a Porsche,</v>

464
00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:31.480
<v Speaker 1>a baby with a beard and there was a grown woman next to the baby and the baby</v>

465
00:14:31.481 --> 00:14:35.200
<v Speaker 1>has like a Tuxedo on and it's like you've always wanted the biggest bed,</v>

466
00:14:35.201 --> 00:14:38.110
<v Speaker 1>his beard and the baby goes to the nightclub and a bouncer looks at him and</v>

467
00:14:38.111 --> 00:14:38.411
<v Speaker 1>winks.</v>

468
00:14:38.411 --> 00:14:39.161
<v Speaker 1>And I'm looking at this,</v>

469
00:14:39.161 --> 00:14:41.470
<v Speaker 1>look at this commercial [inaudible] see the babies?</v>

470
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:42.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

471
00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:43.990
<v Speaker 1>So the baby walks in just for men.</v>

472
00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:46.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't know what the fuck just for men if you don't know it is some</v>

473
00:14:46.871 --> 00:14:48.910
<v Speaker 1>stuff that guys put in their feed when they're getting old.</v>

474
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.560
<v Speaker 1>So this baby's got a bottle,</v>

475
00:14:50.830 --> 00:14:52.130
<v Speaker 1>he goes out to the dance floor,</v>

476
00:14:52.131 --> 00:14:56.600
<v Speaker 1>there's all these girls with these tiny little skirts dancing around him and</v>

477
00:14:56.601 --> 00:14:57.350
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>

478
00:14:57.350 --> 00:15:00.230
<v Speaker 1>he's like a pimp and he's with this hot woman.</v>

479
00:15:00.410 --> 00:15:03.350
<v Speaker 1>And this to me my bit was this is proof,</v>

480
00:15:03.351 --> 00:15:04.310
<v Speaker 1>positive proof,</v>

481
00:15:04.311 --> 00:15:04.731
<v Speaker 1>positive.</v>

482
00:15:04.731 --> 00:15:07.130
<v Speaker 1>There's no sexual equality when it comes to child molesting.</v>

483
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:10.820
<v Speaker 1>Cause if you even wrote that down with the sex is reversed.</v>

484
00:15:10.821 --> 00:15:11.930
<v Speaker 1>If you even wrote it down,</v>

485
00:15:12.050 --> 00:15:13.610
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking going to jail.</v>

486
00:15:13.790 --> 00:15:14.300
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

487
00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:18.230
<v Speaker 1>There's a little baby girl and she goes out to a room full of guys who are</v>

488
00:15:18.231 --> 00:15:22.010
<v Speaker 1>wearing Tarzan skirts and they're all swinging dicks around her and she's got a</v>

489
00:15:22.011 --> 00:15:25.340
<v Speaker 1>bottle and they're all fighting for her attention and kissing her on the cheek.</v>

490
00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.110
<v Speaker 1>You would go to fucking jail.</v>

491
00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.990
<v Speaker 1>But that was a commercial that aired on mainstream television.</v>

492
00:15:29.991 --> 00:15:30.980
<v Speaker 1>No one cared about it.</v>

493
00:15:31.070 --> 00:15:32.510
<v Speaker 1>That commercial air for years,</v>

494
00:15:32.570 --> 00:15:34.100
<v Speaker 1>it's probably still on now.</v>

495
00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:37.940
<v Speaker 1>And that commercial is proof positive that we have a completely different</v>

496
00:15:37.941 --> 00:15:42.941
<v Speaker 1>attitude towards a grown woman who's hot as fuck and a little baby.</v>

497
00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:43.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

498
00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:46.040
<v Speaker 1>well even I was watching big with the kids the other day.</v>

499
00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:47.360
<v Speaker 1>Tom Hanks is what?</v>

500
00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:48.420
<v Speaker 1>Eight in that movie?</v>

501
00:15:48.420 --> 00:15:51.620
<v Speaker 1>Nine and then that woman's seduces him and I guess he fucks her.</v>

502
00:15:51.621 --> 00:15:53.780
<v Speaker 1>He gets a boner and I'm like,</v>

503
00:15:53.930 --> 00:15:55.280
<v Speaker 1>you're raping a child.</v>

504
00:15:55.340 --> 00:15:56.173
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

505
00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:57.040
<v Speaker 1>Why are we watching?</v>

506
00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:57.873
<v Speaker 1>And she's hot.</v>

507
00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:59.870
<v Speaker 1>She's hot and he looks like a man.</v>

508
00:15:59.871 --> 00:16:01.070
<v Speaker 1>So I just let it ride.</v>

509
00:16:02.330 --> 00:16:04.090
<v Speaker 1>If that movie was reversed and it was a,</v>

510
00:16:04.091 --> 00:16:08.420
<v Speaker 1>a young girl that all of a sudden was in a sexual woman's body and the guy was</v>

511
00:16:08.421 --> 00:16:08.870
<v Speaker 1>fucking her.</v>

512
00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:09.141
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>

513
00:16:09.141 --> 00:16:09.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

514
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:10.790
<v Speaker 1>Are we supposed to be doing this?</v>

515
00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:12.110
<v Speaker 1>You would be horrified.</v>

516
00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:13.730
<v Speaker 1>You would be absolutely horrified.</v>

517
00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:14.933
<v Speaker 1>These protests,</v>

518
00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:17.000
<v Speaker 1>especially the things like the Milo protest,</v>

519
00:16:17.001 --> 00:16:22.001
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe now that Milo has been humiliated and it at least temporarily side</v>

520
00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:26.390
<v Speaker 1>tracked or put down for a bit while he has to rebuild.</v>

521
00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:31.720
<v Speaker 1>Maybe someone can come along and have reasonable dialog and do some sort of a</v>

522
00:16:32.151 --> 00:16:32.781
<v Speaker 1>campus B.</v>

523
00:16:32.781 --> 00:16:33.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it.</v>

524
00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.910
<v Speaker 1>Why is he doing these things on campuses?</v>

525
00:16:34.911 --> 00:16:35.270
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

526
00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:36.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he gets paid for most of them.</v>

527
00:16:37.220 --> 00:16:38.030
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

528
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:40.100
<v Speaker 1>My theory with Milo is a,</v>

529
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:42.170
<v Speaker 1>I think his eyesight's getting worse.</v>

530
00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:45.650
<v Speaker 1>His glasses are getting thicker and thicker and he sorta going,</v>

531
00:16:45.651 --> 00:16:48.170
<v Speaker 1>this is my moment to make an impact.</v>

532
00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:48.831
<v Speaker 1>So he's just like,</v>

533
00:16:48.831 --> 00:16:49.730
<v Speaker 1>you think he's going blind?</v>

534
00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:50.271
<v Speaker 1>I think so,</v>

535
00:16:50.271 --> 00:16:50.890
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

536
00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:52.220
<v Speaker 1>He just theorizing this.</v>

537
00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:53.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

538
00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:55.850
<v Speaker 1>He's only like 28 yeah.</v>

539
00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:56.511
<v Speaker 1>But you look at him,</v>

540
00:16:56.511 --> 00:16:56.780
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

541
00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:57.180
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

542
00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:58.130
<v Speaker 1>he just can't read English.</v>

543
00:16:58.370 --> 00:16:59.180
<v Speaker 1>They're insane.</v>

544
00:16:59.180 --> 00:16:59.570
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

545
00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:00.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

546
00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:00.890
<v Speaker 1>And they're getting thicker.</v>

547
00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:02.293
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's stress,</v>

548
00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:03.871
<v Speaker 1>stress me,</v>

549
00:17:03.871 --> 00:17:04.704
<v Speaker 1>his eyes worse.</v>

550
00:17:05.570 --> 00:17:06.470
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

551
00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:07.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

552
00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:08.143
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a doctor.</v>

553
00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:11.630
<v Speaker 1>I can't think it would be good.</v>

554
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:14.720
<v Speaker 1>But I think he's trying to make a maximum impact,</v>

555
00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:15.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

556
00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:17.960
<v Speaker 1>in a short amount of time cause you think he doesn't have much time left.</v>

557
00:17:17.990 --> 00:17:19.460
<v Speaker 1>That's such a way he seems healthy</v>

558
00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:21.470
<v Speaker 1>weight.</v>

559
00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:21.801
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

560
00:17:21.801 --> 00:17:22.820
<v Speaker 1>when we were in Orlando,</v>

561
00:17:22.821 --> 00:17:24.350
<v Speaker 1>we made out at the site of the,</v>

562
00:17:24.351 --> 00:17:24.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

563
00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:28.340
<v Speaker 1>you guys made out of the cab was Milo to offend Muslims.</v>

564
00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

565
00:17:29.330 --> 00:17:30.163
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

566
00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:32.990
<v Speaker 1>I did a big speech about freedom and [inaudible] America.</v>

567
00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:34.603
<v Speaker 1>Delicious.</v>

568
00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:35.890
<v Speaker 1>I like strawberries.</v>

569
00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:40.070
<v Speaker 1>Well at least he freshens breath up before I know gaze just tastes better.</v>

570
00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:42.531
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

571
00:17:42.531 --> 00:17:43.191
<v Speaker 1>fuck is lamb.</v>

572
00:17:43.191 --> 00:17:46.790
<v Speaker 1>And then we made out at the site of the Orlando shooting to Muslims,</v>

573
00:17:46.791 --> 00:17:48.410
<v Speaker 1>but we had armed guards and stuff.</v>

574
00:17:48.411 --> 00:17:48.741
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

575
00:17:48.741 --> 00:17:48.921
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

576
00:17:48.921 --> 00:17:51.450
<v Speaker 1>I want to make sure these guys are scoping out the rooms and shit.</v>

577
00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:51.990
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

578
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.321
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

579
00:17:52.321 --> 00:17:53.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't care if I die,</v>

580
00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:54.720
<v Speaker 1>I'll happily die for this.</v>

581
00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:55.531
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

582
00:17:55.531 --> 00:17:55.771
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

583
00:17:55.771 --> 00:17:56.431
<v Speaker 1>I do care.</v>

584
00:17:56.431 --> 00:17:56.821
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>

585
00:17:56.821 --> 00:17:57.810
<v Speaker 1>I've got three kids.</v>

586
00:17:57.850 --> 00:17:58.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

587
00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:58.371
<v Speaker 1>what does,</v>

588
00:17:58.371 --> 00:17:59.790
<v Speaker 1>is it Neil Ism or nihilism?</v>

589
00:17:59.791 --> 00:18:00.540
<v Speaker 1>I always say it wrong.</v>

590
00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:01.410
<v Speaker 1>I always say nihilism,</v>

591
00:18:01.411 --> 00:18:02.244
<v Speaker 1>nihilism,</v>

592
00:18:02.370 --> 00:18:07.370
<v Speaker 1>that nihilistic sort of instinct that he has.</v>

593
00:18:07.801 --> 00:18:12.030
<v Speaker 1>He has a burn it all down instinct and I think he has that with his life as</v>

594
00:18:12.031 --> 00:18:12.600
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

595
00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.690
<v Speaker 1>And I think a lot of that I'm,</v>

596
00:18:14.790 --> 00:18:18.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm planning some serious bro psychologists here,</v>

597
00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:19.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

598
00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:22.320
<v Speaker 1>some armchair psychology from someone totally unqualified.</v>

599
00:18:22.321 --> 00:18:25.520
<v Speaker 1>But you've got to attribute that to any,</v>

600
00:18:25.530 --> 00:18:28.230
<v Speaker 1>at least in some ways being molested as a child.</v>

601
00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:32.400
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine that his experiences that he's calling positive experiences when</v>

602
00:18:32.401 --> 00:18:33.234
<v Speaker 1>he was young,</v>

603
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:37.020
<v Speaker 1>in many ways those could have potentially damaged him.</v>

604
00:18:37.021 --> 00:18:40.800
<v Speaker 1>And also being young and being homosexual and being rejected,</v>

605
00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:43.410
<v Speaker 1>all of those things wreck havoc.</v>

606
00:18:43.411 --> 00:18:44.220
<v Speaker 1>And you,</v>

607
00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:45.390
<v Speaker 1>you develop this,</v>

608
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:46.171
<v Speaker 1>fuck you,</v>

609
00:18:46.171 --> 00:18:47.190
<v Speaker 1>I want to burn it down.</v>

610
00:18:47.191 --> 00:18:52.191
<v Speaker 1>And this is one of the strategies that he sort of adopted that strategy to be</v>

611
00:18:52.441 --> 00:18:54.990
<v Speaker 1>this guy who was very difficult for like,</v>

612
00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:55.500
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>

613
00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:56.580
<v Speaker 1>he's gay.</v>

614
00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:58.160
<v Speaker 1>He's um,</v>

615
00:18:58.210 --> 00:18:58.470
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

616
00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:02.620
<v Speaker 1>an English gay guy who's a right winger and mean it's,</v>

617
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:04.170
<v Speaker 1>it's so baffling to them.</v>

618
00:19:04.171 --> 00:19:05.260
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what to do.</v>

619
00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.820
<v Speaker 1>They hate it because they see blacks and gays as their little pets,</v>

620
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:11.220
<v Speaker 1>and they like putting them on the front lines and going,</v>

621
00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.300
<v Speaker 1>look at who we're helping.</v>

622
00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:14.490
<v Speaker 1>And then when one of them defects to the other side,</v>

623
00:19:14.491 --> 00:19:16.410
<v Speaker 1>they become particularly outraged,</v>

624
00:19:16.411 --> 00:19:19.170
<v Speaker 1>but very few defect at the level that he's defected.</v>

625
00:19:19.171 --> 00:19:19.670
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

626
00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:20.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

627
00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.410
<v Speaker 1>turned around and started attacking direct guy here.</v>
