00:00:04.851 --> 00:00:07.190
<v Speaker 1>Harvey Weinstein case is going to go.</v>

3

<v Speaker 1>Benjamin Bratt push for dismissal and he</v>

5
00:00:19.771 --> 00:00:24.771
<v Speaker 1>didn't get it that the lawyer said the</v>
<v Speaker 1>judge said a trial date to get a trial</v>

6
00:00:25.801 --> 00:00:28.230

8
00:00:30.421 --> 00:00:35.421
<v Speaker 1>time to go for time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he's going to fire Benjamin,</v>

9
00:00:35.581 --> 00:00:40.581
<v Speaker 1>Braf and show up with two women,</v>
<v Speaker 1>primarily one black and one Asian or one</v>

<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very interesting,</v>

12
00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.220
<v Speaker 1>our results over the higher millions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars and prosecute in a private</v>

13
00:00:56.281 --> 00:00:59.340
<v Speaker 1>investigators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll interview boyfriends.</v>

14
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.580
<v Speaker 1>They're going to interview this case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be very interesting,</v>

15
00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.790
<v Speaker 1>unlike the cosby case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weight caused me.</v>

16
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.550
<v Speaker 1>Didn't really fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you know he's going to do all</v>

<v Speaker 1>would do.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm getting busted for this.</v>

19
00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.790
<v Speaker 1>What do I do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of how I grew up around those</v>

20
00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:22.050
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what you do,</v>

21
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.590
<v Speaker 1>Benjamin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Braf cannot ask a woman the same</v>

22
00:01:25.591 --> 00:01:30.591
<v Speaker 1>question a woman could ask a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm going to go there with either a</v>

<v Speaker 1>an Asian woman,</v>

25
00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.210
<v Speaker 1>or a white woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My first two choices are a black woman.</v>

26
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.990

28
00:01:44.831 --> 00:01:46.690
<v Speaker 1>You're saying that because you're a</v>
<v Speaker 1>black woman.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Gustafson.</v>

62
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.030
<v Speaker 1>I went to New York last week and I went</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the Metropolitan Museum of art with</v>

63
00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.780
<v Speaker 1>my daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She loves art and while I was sitting</v>

64
00:03:25.781 --> 00:03:28.420
<v Speaker 1>there I was added saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go on your own.</v>

65
00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Because my daughter didn't want me</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking pictures in front of the</v>

66
00:03:31.451 --> 00:03:31.960
<v Speaker 1>statutes.</v>

67
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.250
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

68
00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:34.810
<v Speaker 1>Daddy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get out of the pictures of the stash,</v>

69
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.520
<v Speaker 1>so I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck am I hanging out with you</v>

70
00:03:36.521 --> 00:03:38.730
<v Speaker 1>for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was in the Chinese way.</v>

71
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.160
<v Speaker 1>I wanted to see the Armenian when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was funny.</v>

72
00:03:42.161 --> 00:03:46.300
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about when I was 21 and</v>
<v Speaker 1>22 Joe Rogan,</v>

73
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:50.970
<v Speaker 1>I would get stoned to the gills and go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the Museum of natural history.</v>

74
00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.990
<v Speaker 1>The museum or my hobbies back then since</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was such a loan and then people</v>

75
00:03:56.141 --> 00:03:58.030
<v Speaker 1>looking for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was always a criminal.</v>

76
00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.220
<v Speaker 1>I would go over the bridge to either go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to one of those museums.</v>

77
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.390
<v Speaker 1>Why would sit in the courtroom?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would go to a place that had a fucking</v>

78
00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.630
<v Speaker 1>Italian sandwich and I get a bag of wise</v>
<v Speaker 1>potato chips in a 16 ounce coke and you</v>

79
00:04:13.961 --> 00:04:17.200
<v Speaker 1>go to any court room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Court starts at seven at the</v>

80
00:04:17.201 --> 00:04:21.190
<v Speaker 1>metropolitan downtown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take the a train and I'd walk.</v>

81
00:04:21.191 --> 00:04:24.820
<v Speaker 1>I forget now what you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is 1983 81.</v>

82
00:04:24.821 --> 00:04:28.510
<v Speaker 1>I was a kid and I would sit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None observed hort.</v>

83
00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.610
<v Speaker 1>I learned how to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus I grew up in that.</v>

84
00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:36.680
<v Speaker 2>You were what you would sit and watch</v>
<v Speaker 2>night court,</v>

85
00:04:36.681 --> 00:04:41.681
<v Speaker 2>like you'd watch a basketball game,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a game with a sandwich and a soda</v>

86
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.980
<v Speaker 2>and potato chips.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men,</v>

87
00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.190
<v Speaker 2>Chicago this year I think there was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>paper view.</v>

88
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:46.910
<v Speaker 2>You were there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

89
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.430
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So something happened and I was late</v>

90
00:04:49.431 --> 00:04:52.070
<v Speaker 2>getting to the arena and they had cut</v>
<v Speaker 2>off kind of the loading dock.</v>

91
00:04:52.071 --> 00:04:55.640
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't get to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I had my oldest daughter with me and</v>

92
00:04:55.641 --> 00:05:00.470
<v Speaker 2>so we're having a walk through where all</v>
<v Speaker 2>the crowds walking in and you know,</v>

93
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.070
<v Speaker 2>dudes all the golden snitch and get a</v>
<v Speaker 2>picture golden snitch.</v>

94
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.310
<v Speaker 2>My daughter's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck's going on?</v>

95
00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.590
<v Speaker 2>How old is your daughter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So she's 22,</v>

96
00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.000
<v Speaker 2>so two days ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christmas morning I'm opening up</v>

97
00:05:14.001 --> 00:05:17.660
<v Speaker 2>presence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I get the presence for my daughters,</v>

98
00:05:17.661 --> 00:05:21.200
<v Speaker 2>the three of them and my middle daughter</v>
<v Speaker 2>is very artistic and so they create</v>

99
00:05:21.201 --> 00:05:24.320
<v Speaker 2>these cool sculpted beer mugs and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's four of them.</v>

100
00:05:24.321 --> 00:05:28.820
<v Speaker 2>One of them's like Bald Guy Brewing</v>
<v Speaker 2>Novitsky something and one of them says</v>

101
00:05:28.821 --> 00:05:32.460
<v Speaker 2>golden snitch brewing company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's cool looking thing and she,</v>

102
00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.480
<v Speaker 2>she drew me a black and white kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>rendition of all four,</v>

<v Speaker 2>So then my girlfriend's there,</v>

104
00:05:38.001 --> 00:05:40.340
<v Speaker 2>so she hands me the box and she's been</v>
<v Speaker 2>telling me all along.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Mike.</v>

107
00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.820
<v Speaker 2>The hell is this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I opened up the box.</v>

108
00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.710
<v Speaker 2>Oh my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's got this series of t shirts I</v>

109
00:05:53.711 --> 00:05:55.150
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>

<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

112
00:05:58.341 --> 00:06:00.320
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since you created it,</v>

113
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.930
<v Speaker 2>you literally and figuratively have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>wear it.</v>

114
00:06:02.931 --> 00:06:07.220
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is outrageous.</v>

115
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.950
