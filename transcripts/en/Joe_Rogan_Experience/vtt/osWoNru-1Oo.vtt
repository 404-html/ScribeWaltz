00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.890
I'm wearing my Cronk boxing shirt out of respect,

5
00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.200
I wore my Cassius clay a sweatshirt.

6
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.840
Russell Peters has mad boxing knowledge dude.

00:00:26.841 --> 00:00:27.351
He was a,

8
00:00:27.351 --> 00:00:29.810
we were in the back main room of a,

9
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.760
first of all in the comedy store last night.

10
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.021
That was really good.

11
00:00:33.021 --> 00:00:33.201
You know,

12
00:00:33.201 --> 00:00:35.240
that's the first time we've ever hung out in a comedy club together.

13
00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.103
That was really fun.

14
00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.620
Yeah.

15
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.101
What was a,

16
00:00:37.101 --> 00:00:39.200

17
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.120
Paul and Paul was back there.

18
00:00:41.121 --> 00:00:42.560

19
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:43.240
Mark Marin.

20
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.670
Mark.

21
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.851
No,

22
00:00:43.851 --> 00:00:44.840
mark man was in the front.

23
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.090
We were all in the green roofs.

24
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.120
Trey Ho was with us.

25
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.930
[inaudible] just walked into the green room and he sat down.

26
00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.340
Yeah,

27
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.680
so he was sitting there for a while.

28
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.971
Well,

29
00:00:52.971 --> 00:00:53.420
he was,

30
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.530
it was real weird.

31
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:55.100
Like he,

32
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.990
he had a waitress take them back there.

33
00:00:56.991 --> 00:00:58.010
The waitress took them back.

34
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.040
They're like looking for Josh Nasser apparently,

35
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.671
and she's like,

36
00:01:01.671 --> 00:01:02.510
is Josh back here?

37
00:01:02.511 --> 00:01:02.751
I'm like,

38
00:01:02.751 --> 00:01:03.020
nope.

39
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.980
Josh isn't back here.

40
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:05.111
And the guy who was also,

41
00:01:05.111 --> 00:01:05.870
it's okay.

42
00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:06.290
Okay.

43
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:06.831
Like he tells her,

44
00:01:06.831 --> 00:01:07.041
it's okay.

45
00:01:07.041 --> 00:01:08.060
I was just hanging out with these guys.

46
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.680
So he came in and I'm like,

47
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:10.880
is this this guy?

48
00:01:10.881 --> 00:01:11.390
Kind of like,

49
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.020
well what's going on?

50
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.580
So the guy sits down and a Rubin and Russell and I were having this like crazy

51
00:01:16.581 --> 00:01:17.600
boxing conversation.

52
00:01:17.601 --> 00:01:17.721
You know,

53
00:01:17.721 --> 00:01:21.950
they're bringing up old fights from like the 90s and Shit and Roy Jones Jr bouts

54
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.330
and all of a sudden this guy goes,

55
00:01:23.331 --> 00:01:23.720
hey,

56
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.100
you're still wearing the same hat.

57
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.990
That was his opening line is,

58
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.551
hey,

59
00:01:28.551 --> 00:01:29.181
I have some,

60
00:01:29.181 --> 00:01:31.210
some shock just still wearing the same hat.

61
00:01:31.211 --> 00:01:32.044
It's not even an old,

62
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.480
I mean I got this hat last Chris look fucking brand new was when I looked at it,

63
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:36.830
what was the hat I was wearing last night?

64
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.210
Those paper boy hat,

65
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.490
but it had like a leather lip on the bottom.

66
00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.880
It's very,

67
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.691
it was really cool.

68
00:01:41.691 --> 00:01:42.321
I was like digging.

69
00:01:42.321 --> 00:01:43.400
The hat's very nice,

70
00:01:43.401 --> 00:01:43.910
Huh.

71
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.780
But it was just an opening line so that he could come over and talk to us and

72
00:01:47.781 --> 00:01:48.260
he's like,

73
00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.870
his eyes were glossed over and he's all fucked up.

74
00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.660
And I'm realizing,

75
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.831
oh,

76
00:01:51.831 --> 00:01:52.760
this is a crazy person,

77
00:01:52.761 --> 00:01:55.730
just made his way into the green room and I'm looking around with those other

78
00:01:55.731 --> 00:01:56.181
guys here.

79
00:01:56.181 --> 00:01:57.050
They're looking at him like,

80
00:01:57.051 --> 00:01:57.980
who is this fucking guy?

81
00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.401
And I go,

82
00:01:58.401 --> 00:01:58.671
hey man,

83
00:01:58.671 --> 00:01:59.660
you know anybody here?

84
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.251
And he goes,

85
00:02:00.251 --> 00:02:00.371
Oh,

86
00:02:00.371 --> 00:02:01.670
I'm friends with alone.

87
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.650
Like he made up some named Jason.

88
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.940
Yeah,

89
00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.320
fundraising model one 10 like it was some,

90
00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.300
some person that didn't even exist.

91
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:09.211
So like,

92
00:02:09.211 --> 00:02:09.590
hey,

93
00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:10.640
you can't hang out here bro.

94
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:11.533
You gotta get Outta here.

95
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.531
That's what the,

96
00:02:12.531 --> 00:02:14.180
that's the only problem about that place.

97
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.970
So you have those like leeches or this hangers where you're just like,

98
00:02:16.971 --> 00:02:17.481
who are you?

99
00:02:17.481 --> 00:02:18.220
Why are you in this?

100
00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.470
Like,

101
00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.591
no,

102
00:02:18.591 --> 00:02:18.921
it was,

103
00:02:18.921 --> 00:02:21.860
what was funny was because Ruben and I were standing there and the,

104
00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:22.300
and,

105
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.030
and Joe's like,

106
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.330
Hey,

107
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.290
you gotta go buddy.

108
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.060
And he goes,

109
00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.920
Oh and Nah,

110
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:26.301
it's cool.

111
00:02:26.301 --> 00:02:26.601
It's cool.

112
00:02:26.601 --> 00:02:27.281
But none of that now you,

113
00:02:27.281 --> 00:02:27.501
you,

114
00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:28.281
you're not a comic.

115
00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:28.760
You got to,

116
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:29.640
you gotta get the fuck out.

117
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:30.890
Like I'm friends with this guy.

118
00:02:30.891 --> 00:02:31.131
I'm like,

119
00:02:31.131 --> 00:02:31.964
you can't see killing,

120
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.360
hang up,

121
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.340
hang up back here with us and interrupt conversations.

122
00:02:34.341 --> 00:02:35.091
We don't even know you.

123
00:02:35.091 --> 00:02:35.924
This is weird.

124
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.080
And then the guy goes to sit back down and Joe's like,

125
00:02:39.081 --> 00:02:39.231
no,

126
00:02:39.231 --> 00:02:39.650
no dude,

127
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:40.700
you got to leave it.

128
00:02:40.701 --> 00:02:42.500
We're in deep into the comedy store.

129
00:02:42.501 --> 00:02:44.060
Green Room behind the main room.

130
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:45.590
So you have to go backstage,

131
00:02:45.591 --> 00:02:46.311
down the hallway,

132
00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:47.480
down another hallway,

133
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.850
go through a where the piano is,

134
00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.310
go behind the stage and then into the door.

135
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:56.000
Like this guy like made it through the catacombs to come back and hang with us.

136
00:02:56.001 --> 00:02:56.834
What it was.

137
00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:57.800
It would have been fine.

138
00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:58.910
He would have gotten through it.

139
00:02:58.911 --> 00:02:59.590
No,

140
00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.480
if he was just not a crazy person.

141
00:03:01.481 --> 00:03:04.210
If you just sat there and laid in the cut as they say.

142
00:03:04.211 --> 00:03:04.650
Yeah.

143
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.650
But we were in the middle of this intense conversation and talking about Roberto

144
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:10.150
Duran and you know,

145
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.960
when boxing fans get together and start talking about old boxing fights and you

146
00:03:13.961 --> 00:03:14.111
know,

147
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:17.620
you know about fights and I know about obscure show Mike Mccallum,

148
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:19.570
the body snatcher Ooh Shit.

149
00:03:19.571 --> 00:03:20.980
And you start all the way champ.

150
00:03:20.981 --> 00:03:21.480
Adas.

151
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:21.680
Yeah.

152
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.951
Milk,

153
00:03:21.951 --> 00:03:22.540
McCrory,

154
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.440
Donald Curry,

155
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:24.281
all that shit.

156
00:03:24.281 --> 00:03:25.390
You start talking about those.

157
00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.460
And Mccallum was Jamaican.

158
00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.871
Interesting.

159
00:03:27.871 --> 00:03:28.760
He was a bad mother fucker.

160
00:03:28.761 --> 00:03:29.050
Yeah.

161
00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:32.650
I cried and I went for a run after he knocked out Donald Curry.

162
00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:33.550
I remember that.

163
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:35.680
Knocked him out cold with a left hook.

164
00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:36.161
The Motor,

165
00:03:36.161 --> 00:03:37.420
the Motor City Cobra.

166
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.950
So sad.

167
00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:40.360
It was so sad.

168
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.190
Donald Curry was supposed to be the next coming,

169
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.110
he was of lad motherfucker when he was at one 47 after he knocked out,

170
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.460
was it melt Macquarie that he knocked out and then he went up to a junior

171
00:03:51.461 --> 00:03:53.470
middleweight or middleware and then he lost,

172
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.353
he started losing,

173
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.610
he got beat by um,

174
00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:58.510
honey Lloyd Hannigan.

175
00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.230
Lloyd Huntington.

176
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.063
That's right.

177
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.090
And that was an upset.

178
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.490
It was.

179
00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.400
That was after he believed was English.

180
00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:04.030
Yes,

181
00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.110
he was a bad mother fucker too.

182
00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:05.880
Very scrappy.

183
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.970
<v 3>I met him when I was in England back in the day.</v>

184
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.130
That was big worth Lik,

185
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.481
oh,

186
00:04:10.481 --> 00:04:10.830
now he's,

187
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:11.663
he's shot.

188
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.333
Fuck.

189
00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.193
That's hard to,

190
00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.130
that's hard to deal with it.

191
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.920
So a lot of fighters that I bumped into her like that and I'm like,

192
00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:19.500
Ooh,

193
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.333
<v 2>it's terrible.</v>

194
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:21.300
Yeah.

195
00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.710
That's why I always tell them,

196
00:04:22.711 --> 00:04:24.000
if you're thinking about getting out,

197
00:04:24.001 --> 00:04:24.834
get out.

198
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:25.241
Oh yeah.

199
00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:26.610
I didn't have a thought in your head.

200
00:04:26.611 --> 00:04:26.900
Like,

201
00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.220
you're not going to be a world champion.

202
00:04:28.221 --> 00:04:28.860
This is going to be,

203
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:29.510
isn't going to be your

204
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.901
<v 3>career.</v>

205
00:04:29.901 --> 00:04:30.051
You know,

206
00:04:30.051 --> 00:04:30.800
buddy McGirt,

207
00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.070
uh,

208
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.903
is a friend of mine.

209
00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:32.600
He's crazy.

210
00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.960
He's a,

211
00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.940
he was a great fighter and he's a great trainer now.

212
00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.300
Yeah,

213
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.133
he is.

214
00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:37.723
He's fine.

215
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:38.390
He's fat,

216
00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:39.223
he's happy.

217
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.970
He does look fat when he's training guys.

218
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.650
Oh he is.

219
00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:42.850
But he's enjoying life and,

220
00:04:42.851 --> 00:04:43.220
and I mean,

221
00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.670
Nice.

222
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:44.240
And uh,

223
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.781
he told me,

224
00:04:44.781 --> 00:04:45.021
I said,

225
00:04:45.021 --> 00:04:45.741
what made you quit?

226
00:04:45.741 --> 00:04:46.490
And he goes,

227
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:46.911
you know,

228
00:04:46.911 --> 00:04:50.480
I had retired and then I thought somebody asked me if I wanted to fight for a

229
00:04:50.481 --> 00:04:52.070
title and I was like,

230
00:04:52.071 --> 00:04:52.580
yeah,

231
00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.840
I do want to fight for a title.

232
00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.651
So he said,

233
00:04:54.651 --> 00:04:55.070
I,

234
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.460
I,

235
00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.420
I started my training camp and I was out there running at eight in the morning

236
00:04:59.421 --> 00:05:02.540
one day and then halfway through the run I said,

237
00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:04.280
what the fuck am I doing?

238
00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.360
If I was training for a fight when I was wanted to be a fighter,

239
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.990
I'd be running at 5:00 AM I shouldn't be here at 8:00 AM.

240
00:05:11.991 --> 00:05:12.980
I should have been here already.

241
00:05:12.981 --> 00:05:14.210
I should have finished this already.

242
00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.580
And he turned around and went home and canceled everything.

243
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:17.830
Whoa.

244
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:18.561
Said fuck this.

245
00:05:18.561 --> 00:05:20.930
I realize that it wasn't the same person.

246
00:05:20.931 --> 00:05:21.081
Yeah.

247
00:05:21.081 --> 00:05:21.501
He was like,

248
00:05:21.501 --> 00:05:23.790
if I was the guy who was really training for Fido,

249
00:05:23.791 --> 00:05:24.920
it'd been out here at 5:00 AM,

250
00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.050
what am I doing here at eight and eight in the morning?

251
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.300
Well

252
00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.180
<v 2>that's what's so exciting about this upcoming fight.</v>

253
00:05:30.181 --> 00:05:33.140
This one can between Jon Jones and Daniel Cormier Yang is it?

254
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:38.180
Both of these guys are training like wild bunch of it online.

255
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:40.440
They're talking shit to each other and,

256
00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:44.490
and all the footage of them training like some serious intensity and the

257
00:05:44.491 --> 00:05:46.560
training is really exciting stuff,

258
00:05:46.561 --> 00:05:46.890
man.

259
00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:47.640
It's a,

260
00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:48.211
I tell you what,

261
00:05:48.211 --> 00:05:48.261
I,

262
00:05:48.261 --> 00:05:50.610
I haven't looked forward to a UFC fight in awhile.

263
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:51.361
Yeah.

264
00:05:51.361 --> 00:05:54.570
I haven't looked forward to a fight as much as this one in a long time.

265
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.721
Well,

266
00:05:54.721 --> 00:05:56.070
I look forward to all of them really.

267
00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.580
I,

268
00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:56.821
you know,

269
00:05:56.821 --> 00:05:57.441
as a fan,

270
00:05:57.441 --> 00:05:58.040
I look forward to

271
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.131
<v 3>it.</v>

272
00:05:58.131 --> 00:06:00.290
But this is one that has Superfight status.

273
00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.010
Yes.

274
00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.640
It's like,

275
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.331
it's like the,

276
00:06:02.331 --> 00:06:02.800
you know,

277
00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.700
the Leonard Hagler type of situation.

278
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.541
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

279
00:06:05.541 --> 00:06:06.081
totally.

280
00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:09.200
Like I almost can't believe that they're going to do it this weekend.

281
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:09.891
It's almost like,

282
00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:10.190
whoa.

283
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.491
It's all,

284
00:06:10.491 --> 00:06:10.970
it's all,

285
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:11.840
it's almost too good.

286
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.020
Core me does look like a physically larger human being.

287
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.351
Well,

288
00:06:15.351 --> 00:06:16.184
he's short.

289
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:16.590
You know,

290
00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.500
Columbia is only a little taller than me.

291
00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.400
I think he's five 10 but he's a fucking powerhouse.

292
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:23.750
I tell you what,

293
00:06:23.751 --> 00:06:24.531
I'll say it now.

294
00:06:24.531 --> 00:06:24.981
I think,

295
00:06:24.981 --> 00:06:25.490
uh,

296
00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:26.271
I smell upset,

297
00:06:26.271 --> 00:06:26.780
buddy.

298
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:27.471
Really think so.

299
00:06:27.471 --> 00:06:28.304
I think so.

300
00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:28.730
Well,

301
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:29.870
it is possible.

302
00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.570
I mean there's no doubt cornea is elite.

303
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.760
Columbia has never even been in trouble.

304
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:35.900
Not even for a moment.

305
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:36.230
Yeah.

306
00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.620
Columbia,

307
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:39.530
he's beaten two former UFC heavyweight champions,

308
00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.770
but then he trains with Kane on a daily basis.

309
00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:42.921
Well,

310
00:06:42.921 --> 00:06:43.521
not only that,

311
00:06:43.521 --> 00:06:45.930
he brought in this bad ass Russian motherfucker.

312
00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:48.680
I'm going to try to pronounce this name without goofing it up,

313
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.843
but uh,

314
00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:52.910
I think it's gassed aloft brings in hold on.

315
00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:53.863
Wrestler.

316
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:55.580
I'll Paul pull up the dude.

317
00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:57.500
He's a wrestling base guy as well.

318
00:06:57.501 --> 00:06:58.160
Cormy and correct.

319
00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:58.850
Yes.

320
00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:59.810
As is John Jones.

321
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:00.733
Yeah.

322
00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:01.900
<v 3>But I mean you,</v>

323
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:02.140
you,

324
00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.960
you know when you're dealing with somebody who's like a,

325
00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:07.980
a stout little log like that and your long and Lanky,

326
00:07:07.981 --> 00:07:09.390
it's really not that easy.

327
00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:10.121
Well,

328
00:07:10.121 --> 00:07:10.300
it's

329
00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.770
<v 2>way harder to deal with tall guys,</v>

330
00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:16.660
especially at tall guy like Jon Jones who knows how to work as height.

331
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.021
Yeah.

332
00:07:17.021 --> 00:07:17.411
This is,

333
00:07:17.411 --> 00:07:18.790
I'm going to try to say this guy's name,

334
00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:20.740
k.

335
00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:25.270
H.

336
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.270
A.

337
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.270
N.

338
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.270
J.

339
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.270
U.

340
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.270
M.

341
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.270
U.

342
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.270
R.

343
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.270
A.

344
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.950
D.

345
00:07:25.950 --> 00:07:27.270
I'm not going to try Jim Rod.

346
00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:27.731
Yeah.

347
00:07:27.731 --> 00:07:28.930
Maybe consumer Rod.

348
00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.260
It's probably like a year.

349
00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:30.701
No.

350
00:07:30.701 --> 00:07:30.911
Right.

351
00:07:30.911 --> 00:07:31.141
You're,

352
00:07:31.141 --> 00:07:32.940
you're pretty good with different that our alums and stuff.

353
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:35.500
This gentleman in the front row,

354
00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:36.320
<v 3>uh,</v>

355
00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:36.830
let's see.

356
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:37.041
Oh yeah,

357
00:07:37.041 --> 00:07:37.580
try that.

358
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:37.821
Cut.

359
00:07:37.821 --> 00:07:39.360
Juma Rod Gasta love.

360
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.450
That's the love.

361
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.390
He's a obviously some total of Muslim Russian.

362
00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:43.810
<v 2>Okay.</v>

363
00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:45.190
He's a bad motherfuckers.

364
00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:45.970
What he is.

365
00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:46.661
God Damn,

366
00:07:46.661 --> 00:07:47.680
that guy can wrestle.

367
00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.990
I watched a bunch of his matches last night.

368
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:51.431
Where's he from?

369
00:07:51.431 --> 00:07:54.310
Russia or former one of those break off countries.

370
00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:55.240
One of the stands,

371
00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:56.710
he was actually an Uzbek,

372
00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:58.270
I think he's from Russia itself.

373
00:07:58.660 --> 00:07:59.080
Um,

374
00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.750
he was one of the first guys to a beat Daniel Cormier.

375
00:08:02.751 --> 00:08:02.981
Any like,

376
00:08:02.981 --> 00:08:03.814
he uh,

377
00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:06.550
he beat down Daniel Cormier several times.

378
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.130
Like one of the best guys that that ever beat Daniel,

379
00:08:09.131 --> 00:08:09.491
I should say.

380
00:08:09.491 --> 00:08:10.480
Not One of the first guys,

381
00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:11.321
but he,

382
00:08:11.321 --> 00:08:12.010
um,

383
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:12.850
massive,

384
00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:13.120
uh,

385
00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.160
credentials behind him.

386
00:08:14.161 --> 00:08:18.160
Five world championships for European Championships.

387
00:08:18.161 --> 00:08:20.440
Anyone at Olympic gold Olympic gold metal.

388
00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:21.121
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

389
00:08:21.121 --> 00:08:21.890
This guy's,

390
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:23.790
it's is smart too and bringing him in.

391
00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:24.300
Yeah.

392
00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:24.451
Hey,

393
00:08:24.451 --> 00:08:25.320
this guy beat me.

394
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.430
Maybe I should learn from him.

395
00:08:26.820 --> 00:08:26.971
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

396
00:08:26.971 --> 00:08:27.660
he beat,

397
00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:28.830
he beat Daniel Cormier Yang.

398
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:30.133
Um,

399
00:08:30.540 --> 00:08:32.880
submitted them in the 96 kilograms.

400
00:08:32.881 --> 00:08:33.990
Athens finals.

401
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:36.730
What's 96 kilos?

402
00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.600
It's two oh six or something like that.

403
00:08:38.601 --> 00:08:40.050
It was around two 10 or something like that.

404
00:08:40.470 --> 00:08:41.640
He's a beast up point.

405
00:08:41.641 --> 00:08:42.120
Is that like,

406
00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:47.120
I love the fact that this guy is this wicked fucking wrestler and he beat Corp

407
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.100
Mya and wrestling company.

408
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:52.170
He brings him in with them to train for Jon Jones.

409
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.500
The thing about Jon Jones Hall stylistically,

410
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:56.220
he's so

411
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:56.821
<v 4>unusual.</v>

412
00:08:56.821 --> 00:08:58.380
He's so tall and he,

413
00:08:58.381 --> 00:08:58.611
you,

414
00:08:58.611 --> 00:09:02.280
he can hit you for like four or five inches before you can even touch him.

415
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:04.110
And he knows how to work his height.

416
00:09:04.170 --> 00:09:06.410
He's the best at like Tommy Hearns Zeus to uh,

417
00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:07.560
keep guys out with the jab.

418
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:08.400
Yeah,

419
00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.300
very similar.

420
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.200
But you know,

421
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:11.063
Tommy Hearns,

422
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:11.671
I think,

423
00:09:11.671 --> 00:09:12.504
uh,

424
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:13.710
Tommy Hearns,

425
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:13.951
well,

426
00:09:13.951 --> 00:09:17.010
Tommy Hearns at that ridiculous one punch power that Jones doesn't,

427
00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:18.870
it doesn't totally have yet.

428
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:19.840
You know,

429
00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.240
if he ever is going to have it.

430
00:09:21.241 --> 00:09:21.361
I mean,

431
00:09:21.361 --> 00:09:22.260
he's 27,

432
00:09:22.410 --> 00:09:24.920
he's more of an accumulative striker Jones,

433
00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:26.310
you know,

434
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:28.530
he could grow into his power to maybe,

435
00:09:28.531 --> 00:09:31.290
but Tommy would put motherfuckers to sleep.

436
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:33.500
Emily put Roberto Duran the second round.

437
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:34.290
I'll cold.

438
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:35.220
Good Lord.

439
00:09:35.280 --> 00:09:36.113
I thought he was dead.

440
00:09:36.690 --> 00:09:37.220
That was that.

441
00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:41.400
That was the package out knock out of the 80s it was face down.

442
00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.550
It was hard to see Roberto Duran go out like that too.

443
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:46.560
It's almost like I didn't believe it was possible.

444
00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:50.340
Like that was how like opponent's got knocked out.

445
00:09:50.430 --> 00:09:51.000
You know what I mean?

446
00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.900
That's how guys who you never thought were going to beat Terry Norris got

447
00:09:54.901 --> 00:09:55.734
knocked out.

448
00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:58.500
But when you see a guy like Roberto Duran,

449
00:09:58.501 --> 00:10:00.810
a living legend get CalEd like that,

450
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:02.550
it's really hard to believe.

451
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.580
And then Duran had the bout with Hagler after I went the distance,

452
00:10:05.730 --> 00:10:06.360
ironically.

453
00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:06.961
You know what I mean?

454
00:10:06.961 --> 00:10:08.870
And actually just tends to be the beast of a puncher.

455
00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.060
Back then I had more respect for Duran,

456
00:10:11.070 --> 00:10:11.580
I think.

457
00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:12.210
I think hang on,

458
00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:15.840
had a lot of respect for Duran as a boxer and didn't want to do anything stupid.

459
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:18.840
That's after Duran and beaten Davey Moore,

460
00:10:18.870 --> 00:10:19.111
right?

461
00:10:19.111 --> 00:10:19.320
Yep.

462
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.270
They resurrected his career with Davey Moore.

463
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:21.660
Yup.

464
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:25.000
And then he did it again with a ran Barkley in 1989 that's right.

465
00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:27.133
You know,

466
00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:28.921
Davey Moore died,

467
00:10:28.921 --> 00:10:29.550
right?

468
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:30.550
His car fell on him.

469
00:10:30.551 --> 00:10:32.070
And he was fixing his car in his driveway.

470
00:10:32.071 --> 00:10:33.570
It fell off the bricks and fucking crushed them.

471
00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:34.470
Oh,

472
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:35.310
that sucks.

473
00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.780
Fuck man.

474
00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:39.900
What do you even do if your friend's trapped under a car like that?

475
00:10:39.901 --> 00:10:40.111
I mean,

476
00:10:40.111 --> 00:10:41.700
you gotta get a Jack under it.

477
00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:43.141
I'll start asking around.

478
00:10:43.141 --> 00:10:43.974
Who's got AAA?

479
00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:50.430
What a scary way to die smushed under a car.

480
00:10:51.410 --> 00:10:51.910
I think it was,

481
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:52.710
it was a good car,

482
00:10:52.710 --> 00:10:53.543
not a Camry.

483
00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:54.643
Right?

484
00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:57.110
Camry is a bull ring.

485
00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:57.730
Everyone.

486
00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:58.563
And

487
00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.180
um,

488
00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.290
there was a thing on Iran,

489
00:11:01.291 --> 00:11:03.270
Barkley the other day that he's like homeless.

490
00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:03.720
I've,

491
00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:03.931
oh,

492
00:11:03.931 --> 00:11:04.411
you know what,

493
00:11:04.411 --> 00:11:08.040
a friend of mine and my cousin lives in Brooklyn and uh,

494
00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:09.810
he trains at Gleason's every now and then,

495
00:11:10.530 --> 00:11:11.030
uh,

496
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.460
and uh,

497
00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.600
Barclay Trans fighters there for five bucks or 20 bucks or something like that.

498
00:11:14.670 --> 00:11:15.150
Wow.

499
00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:17.700
He'll train you for like an hour for five or 20 bucks,

500
00:11:17.701 --> 00:11:19.110
something really ridiculously cheap.

501
00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:20.820
I ran whatever you have.

502
00:11:20.821 --> 00:11:21.151
Really.

503
00:11:21.151 --> 00:11:21.781
You got five bucks,

504
00:11:21.781 --> 00:11:22.720
he'll take it and you have 20,

505
00:11:22.721 --> 00:11:25.560
it'll take it a world champion.

506
00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:26.011
You know,

507
00:11:26.011 --> 00:11:26.860
I'm a world champ.

508
00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:28.620
Tommy Hearns remember that?

509
00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:28.850
Yeah.

510
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:29.190
You know,

511
00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:30.060
I still actually,

512
00:11:30.061 --> 00:11:33.570
I remember that vividly because I remember watching it live when he fought

513
00:11:33.571 --> 00:11:33.930
Duran.

514
00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:36.450
And I still think Duran Kinda got the,

515
00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:37.860
I don't really think,

516
00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:39.540
I think Barkley should have won that fight.

517
00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:40.790
You think so?

518
00:11:40.790 --> 00:11:41.130
Yeah.

519
00:11:41.130 --> 00:11:44.670
Because Duran Duran got an a out of a,

520
00:11:44.730 --> 00:11:45.180
you know,

521
00:11:45.180 --> 00:11:50.180
a legendary status and a nostalgia and he knocked the Barkley down in the 11th

522
00:11:50.821 --> 00:11:51.360
round.

523
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:51.960
Right.

524
00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:52.670
And uh,

525
00:11:52.670 --> 00:11:52.930
you know,

526
00:11:52.930 --> 00:11:54.190
that was a good knock down,

527
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.020
but Barclay was winning the whole fight of them,

528
00:11:56.021 --> 00:11:57.700
then I would have to go over it.

529
00:11:57.910 --> 00:11:58.211
But,

530
00:11:58.211 --> 00:11:58.360
uh,

531
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:00.100
there's a lot of bad decisions in boxing.

532
00:12:00.101 --> 00:12:00.760
Did you see the,

533
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:00.961
uh,

534
00:12:00.961 --> 00:12:02.890
the Tim Bradley Diego Chavez fight?

535
00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:03.870
Oh yeah.

536
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:04.030
Yeah.

537
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:07.180
He beat Diego Chavez like eight out of 12 rounds clearly.

538
00:12:07.420 --> 00:12:08.320
And they gave a,

539
00:12:08.321 --> 00:12:09.190
they give it a draw.

540
00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:09.970
Yep.

541
00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:10.211
Well,

542
00:12:10.211 --> 00:12:10.391
no.

543
00:12:10.391 --> 00:12:10.961
You know what it was,

544
00:12:10.961 --> 00:12:13.930
I think Chavez came on strong enough to make a disputable.

545
00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:16.720
Do you think so you think it was a very reasonable decision?

546
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:19.240
I think just a draw is better than a loss.

547
00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:21.200
It's definitely better than a lens.

548
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:21.971
And when it's,

549
00:12:21.971 --> 00:12:22.360
you know,

550
00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.580
it could go either way with boxing,

551
00:12:24.581 --> 00:12:25.960
a lot of times what I think is,

552
00:12:25.961 --> 00:12:27.040
I look at it and I go,

553
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:27.520
I,

554
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:30.660
I think they're probably like if,

555
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:32.410
if you had a look at something like that,

556
00:12:32.411 --> 00:12:34.540
they're probably happy that something like that happens.

557
00:12:34.541 --> 00:12:35.620
Like that kind of controversy.

558
00:12:35.621 --> 00:12:37.480
Cause then people talk about it and then they have a rematch.

559
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:37.750
Yeah.

560
00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:38.730
Who would be excited about it?

561
00:12:38.731 --> 00:12:39.371
Tim Bradley.

562
00:12:39.371 --> 00:12:43.180
Diego shopping other than t Diego side Chevez and timber atlas.

563
00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:43.361
No,

564
00:12:43.361 --> 00:12:47.140
nobody would give a shit except for the fact that this decision was disputed.

565
00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:50.560
Like when a decision is disputed then people get excited about the rematch or if

566
00:12:50.561 --> 00:12:52.570
someone gets fucked over like Pacquiao.

567
00:12:52.571 --> 00:12:53.080
Bradley.

568
00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:53.590
Yeah.

569
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:57.640
Nobody really wanted to see that again except for the fact that pack y'all got

570
00:12:57.641 --> 00:12:58.570
robbed in the first fight.

571
00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:58.841
Yeah.

572
00:12:58.841 --> 00:13:00.670
And when people ask me about that fight and when,

573
00:13:00.671 --> 00:13:02.950
when a patio eventually did win the title back,

574
00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:03.491
they said,

575
00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:04.091
did you see the fight?

576
00:13:04.091 --> 00:13:04.421
Where do you think?

577
00:13:04.421 --> 00:13:07.960
I said I think Pacquiao out one more convincingly when he lost.

578
00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:09.250
That's true.

579
00:13:09.250 --> 00:13:10.083
That's funny.

580
00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.313
That's funny.

581
00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:11.840
Yeah.

582
00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:12.580
Pack you watching.

583
00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:15.790
Pack y'all get knocked out by Marcus is another one of those Roberto Duran

584
00:13:15.791 --> 00:13:16.590
moments where you're like,

585
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:17.171
that was a,

586
00:13:17.171 --> 00:13:18.190
that was a scary one.

587
00:13:18.460 --> 00:13:18.971
Crazy.

588
00:13:18.971 --> 00:13:19.960
Like you never saw that.

589
00:13:19.961 --> 00:13:20.141
I mean,

590
00:13:20.141 --> 00:13:21.100
you've seen him get tagged,

591
00:13:21.101 --> 00:13:21.911
he seen him get dropped,

592
00:13:21.911 --> 00:13:24.520
but did you just get piously sleep punched?

593
00:13:24.521 --> 00:13:25.900
Just starched.

594
00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:27.183
Oof.

595
00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:27.491
Yeah.

596
00:13:27.491 --> 00:13:27.971
That was,

597
00:13:27.971 --> 00:13:28.270
um,

598
00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:29.103
that's how,

599
00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:32.920
that's how Kevin Rooney got knocked out by a Alexis Arguayo.

600
00:13:32.921 --> 00:13:33.800
Same way guys.

601
00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:34.420
Right.

602
00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:35.660
A third way.

603
00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:36.941
It was good.

604
00:13:36.941 --> 00:13:37.221
And I,

605
00:13:37.221 --> 00:13:37.810
Kevin,

606
00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:40.180
I remember on Alexis Arguayo made his comeback on,

607
00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.880
it was like ABC wide world of sports.

608
00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:47.140
You on Saturday afternoons five Billy Costello a Odom and everybody's like,

609
00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:47.861
Oh shit.

610
00:13:47.861 --> 00:13:49.210
Alexis Aguayo was back.

611
00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:52.420
I remember even when Aaron Pryor came back and he was still blind in one eye and

612
00:13:52.421 --> 00:13:53.650
they still gave them a license.

613
00:13:53.651 --> 00:13:53.891
I'm like,

614
00:13:53.891 --> 00:13:54.910
are you fucking crazy?

615
00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:56.490
And prior was blind in one eye,

616
00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.580
legally blind in one eye.

617
00:13:57.581 --> 00:13:58.630
And they still get my license.

618
00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:00.770
That's like the great all time box controversy,

619
00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:01.151
right?

620
00:14:01.151 --> 00:14:02.590
Him and Alexis Shark whale.

621
00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:05.890
When Panama Louis says gimme the other bottle of that I mixed.

622
00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:06.310
Yay.

623
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:09.010
He gives it to Aaron Pryor and he comes out like a demon.

624
00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.000
No,

625
00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:10.181
no,

626
00:14:10.181 --> 00:14:10.811
not that one.

627
00:14:10.811 --> 00:14:11.500
The other one?

628
00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:12.250
Yeah.

629
00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:13.630
What could you drink coke?

630
00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:14.650
He was into,

631
00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:15.490
into cocaine.

632
00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:16.960
That was liquid coke.

633
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:18.220
Did they have he drink it?

634
00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:19.570
I don't know if they had it back then that,

635
00:14:19.571 --> 00:14:20.440
but I know they have it now.

636
00:14:20.441 --> 00:14:22.390
They have like these little advising type things.

637
00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:25.000
You just go and you could also just drink it I guess.

638
00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:25.301
Oh,

639
00:14:25.301 --> 00:14:27.070
so you thought that was just a shot in a bar?

640
00:14:27.071 --> 00:14:27.904
Liquid cocaine.

641
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:30.100
Now I was at the name of a shot.

642
00:14:30.101 --> 00:14:31.030
That's the name of a shot.

643
00:14:31.031 --> 00:14:31.864
Liquid cocaine.

644
00:14:32.050 --> 00:14:32.883
What's in it?

645
00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:33.160
Uh,

646
00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.200
I think like fucking red bull and horse shit.

647
00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:38.480
When you shoot a,

648
00:14:38.481 --> 00:14:39.880
this liquid coke up your nose,

649
00:14:39.881 --> 00:14:41.020
it works just like regular coke.

650
00:14:41.090 --> 00:14:41.390
Uh,

651
00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:42.670
I've only done it like three times,

652
00:14:42.671 --> 00:14:43.504
but,

653
00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:45.510
but it,

654
00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:45.860
it,

655
00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:48.370
it didn't seem like it was effective at all.

656
00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:49.810
It just seemed kind of like a,

657
00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:50.853
I don't know why.

658
00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:51.380
Why?

659
00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.330
Why did it take you three times to be like,

660
00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:53.710
all right,

661
00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:54.290
I ain't enough.

662
00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:55.510
I mean it at the same time.

663
00:14:55.540 --> 00:14:56.373
It was the same day.

664
00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:58.340
Meaning like this girl had it and I was like,

665
00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:58.700
what?

666
00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:00.070
They make liquid cocaines yeah.

667
00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.750
And I tried to warn it,

668
00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:02.110
it's,

669
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:02.661
it's just like,

670
00:15:02.661 --> 00:15:04.820
it's just like a Flonase or whatever,

671
00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:07.730
like in your nose and get it in.

672
00:15:07.731 --> 00:15:10.670
There isn't one of those like advising bottles or something like that?

673
00:15:10.671 --> 00:15:10.771
Yeah,

674
00:15:10.771 --> 00:15:11.061
yeah.

675
00:15:11.061 --> 00:15:11.630
Yes.

676
00:15:11.630 --> 00:15:12.490
It's they,

677
00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:15.260
that's how they make it now that they sell it that way because girls can just

678
00:15:15.261 --> 00:15:18.350
put it in their purse and it doesn't look like you're going to the bathroom

679
00:15:18.351 --> 00:15:18.950
during the line.

680
00:15:18.950 --> 00:15:19.521
They just pull it down,

681
00:15:19.521 --> 00:15:21.870
go back to what it just looks like you got advising.

682
00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:22.430
Yeah.

683
00:15:22.430 --> 00:15:23.110
And then there,

684
00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:23.570
wow.

685
00:15:23.570 --> 00:15:24.230
Nosing,

686
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:25.063
no scene.

687
00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:27.080
They didn't really work cocaine culture.

688
00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:27.441
You know,

689
00:15:27.441 --> 00:15:28.950
we were talking about that last night too.

690
00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:30.230
Billy Corbin,

691
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:33.380
the guy who directed cocaine cowboys one and two.

692
00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:34.151
I was thinking though,

693
00:15:34.151 --> 00:15:34.984
smashing pumpkin.

694
00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:36.363
It's different guy.

695
00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:37.633
Totally different guy.

696
00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:38.390
But uh,

697
00:15:38.390 --> 00:15:39.223
he um,

698
00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.600
you know those documentaries we were talking about them.

699
00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:42.411
Corbin,

700
00:15:42.411 --> 00:15:42.621
c.

701
00:15:42.621 --> 00:15:43.790
O.

702
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:43.790
R.

703
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:43.790
B.

704
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:43.790
E.

705
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:43.791
N.

706
00:15:43.791 --> 00:15:44.561
How do you spell those?

707
00:15:44.561 --> 00:15:45.261
Smashing pumpkins.

708
00:15:45.261 --> 00:15:45.680
Capital B.

709
00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:45.890
I.

710
00:15:45.890 --> 00:15:46.723
N.

711
00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:47.001
T.

712
00:15:47.001 --> 00:15:47.151
A.

713
00:15:47.151 --> 00:15:47.421
I.

714
00:15:47.421 --> 00:15:48.254
N.

715
00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:48.561
O.

716
00:15:48.561 --> 00:15:49.820
Org Corgan.

717
00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:51.530
It's core again versus Corbin.

718
00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.800
Corbin Benson to others,

719
00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.600
but we were talking about like Florida,

720
00:15:56.601 --> 00:15:57.830
that cocaine culture,

721
00:15:58.220 --> 00:15:59.360
like the cocaine culture,

722
00:15:59.361 --> 00:16:02.540
the 1980s from like whenever you get cocaine in the mix,

723
00:16:02.730 --> 00:16:03.160
like,

724
00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.110
like when we're talking to them about that restaurant or the bar that we were

725
00:16:06.111 --> 00:16:07.520
all at once in Scottsdale,

726
00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.710
like we're in the middle of this bar,

727
00:16:09.711 --> 00:16:10.011
you know,

728
00:16:10.011 --> 00:16:13.850
we were working on the Tempe Improv and we went out that night to Scottsdale and

729
00:16:13.851 --> 00:16:15.240
we're hanging out and uh,

730
00:16:15.290 --> 00:16:15.741
Brian goes,

731
00:16:15.741 --> 00:16:16.760
everyone's on cocaine.

732
00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:17.271
And I go,

733
00:16:17.271 --> 00:16:17.691
how do you know?

734
00:16:17.691 --> 00:16:17.901
He goes,

735
00:16:17.901 --> 00:16:18.321
look at them all,

736
00:16:18.321 --> 00:16:20.420
they're all talking and they're all playing with her nose.

737
00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:21.890
And I'm looking around and everywhere I look,

738
00:16:21.891 --> 00:16:24.330
people are going like this and everyone's doing that.

739
00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.970
I know he's got some sort of knows issue,

740
00:16:25.971 --> 00:16:27.080
but I've never done cocaine.

741
00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:28.910
I'm almost sure when I'm on stage,

742
00:16:28.911 --> 00:16:29.331
sometimes it,

743
00:16:29.331 --> 00:16:30.001
my nose is itchy,

744
00:16:30.001 --> 00:16:30.211
be like,

745
00:16:30.211 --> 00:16:30.291
go,

746
00:16:30.291 --> 00:16:30.861
he's on coke.

747
00:16:30.861 --> 00:16:31.071
I'm like,

748
00:16:31.071 --> 00:16:32.930
not what this fucking knows Jesus Christ.

749
00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:36.320
I can't afford to do coke with this knows I wouldn't be,

750
00:16:36.330 --> 00:16:37.790
I'd do lane's not lines.

751
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.921
You're welcome guys.

752
00:16:39.921 --> 00:16:44.921
And this joke brought to you by Joe Rogan experience and the Toyota Camry.

753
00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:46.940
The upgrade,

754
00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:48.560
you drink a little,

755
00:16:48.561 --> 00:16:49.670
but you don't fuck with pot,

756
00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:49.911
you know,

757
00:16:49.911 --> 00:16:50.391
and fuck with it.

758
00:16:50.391 --> 00:16:50.631
No,

759
00:16:50.631 --> 00:16:51.081
I'm not a,

760
00:16:51.081 --> 00:16:51.681
I'm not a,

761
00:16:51.681 --> 00:16:52.514
uh,

762
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.863
I've never had,

763
00:16:53.900 --> 00:16:54.970
it's not that I haven't had good,

764
00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:56.003
I never had,

765
00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.260
I never had a bad experience,

766
00:16:57.261 --> 00:16:59.000
but I never had a good experience.

767
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.200
I just had no experience.

768
00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:00.981
And I was,

769
00:17:00.981 --> 00:17:01.191
you know,

770
00:17:01.191 --> 00:17:02.600
when every time I tried weed I was like,

771
00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:03.681
yeah,

772
00:17:03.681 --> 00:17:05.120
this is kind of like a nothingness.

773
00:17:05.121 --> 00:17:07.510
Said I don't need in my life a nothingness.

774
00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:08.450
I felt nothing.

775
00:17:08.451 --> 00:17:10.430
Like I just felt zoned out and I didn't like it.

776
00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:11.271
Uh,

777
00:17:11.271 --> 00:17:13.400
you might've gotten a hold of some of that fucking snoop Dogg,

778
00:17:13.401 --> 00:17:13.980
we'd,

779
00:17:13.980 --> 00:17:15.450
you know that those guys smoke.

780
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:17.150
There's a lot of guys smoke that,

781
00:17:17.151 --> 00:17:17.931
oh Gee Kush,

782
00:17:17.931 --> 00:17:18.211
that's,

783
00:17:18.211 --> 00:17:19.610
it's almost like a narcotic.

784
00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:20.923
You know,

785
00:17:21.090 --> 00:17:25.640
I didn't like the feeling of sluggishness cause I'm already a lazy fuck to begin

786
00:17:25.641 --> 00:17:25.880
with.

787
00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:26.713
You know what I mean?

788
00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:27.680
Blessing Anita is a,

789
00:17:27.680 --> 00:17:28.240
is a,

790
00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:29.120
is an enabler.

791
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:33.740
I'm 100% convinced that everything affects different people in different ways.

792
00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:35.300
I know people can't drink coffee.

793
00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:36.740
They drink a cup of coffee and they fucking,

794
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:37.201
oh yeah.

795
00:17:37.201 --> 00:17:37.790
If the walls,

796
00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:38.630
they just can't do it.

797
00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:39.523
I Shit my pants,

798
00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.020
I usually ship right away after I drink coffee and then I'm good.

799
00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:43.670
It's amazing how that works.

800
00:17:43.671 --> 00:17:45.140
What's going on with coffee that makes you shit?

801
00:17:45.141 --> 00:17:45.980
It's the caffeine.

802
00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:46.730
Is that what to be done?

803
00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:46.911
Well,

804
00:17:46.911 --> 00:17:47.780
when I get up in the morning,

805
00:17:47.781 --> 00:17:50.010
I drink a big bottle of water and then I go down and drink

806
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:52.680
<v 2>my coffee and I'm drinking this organic coffee.</v>

807
00:17:52.681 --> 00:17:53.760
I get in Malibu there.

808
00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:54.690
Um,

809
00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:57.390
it's made to like coconut cream and fucking coconut,

810
00:17:57.391 --> 00:17:58.770
raw sugar and blah blah,

811
00:17:58.771 --> 00:17:59.420
blah.

812
00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.650
She get it from a local vendor or something like,

813
00:18:01.651 --> 00:18:01.901
yeah,

814
00:18:01.901 --> 00:18:02.221
there's like,

815
00:18:02.221 --> 00:18:03.054
there's juicery.

816
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:03.661
Ah,

817
00:18:03.661 --> 00:18:06.120
so you go down there and you get a coffee and it's as cold coffee.

818
00:18:06.121 --> 00:18:07.350
It's fucking great.

819
00:18:07.351 --> 00:18:08.700
But it gets you wired.

820
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:08.941
Oh,

821
00:18:08.941 --> 00:18:10.020
like cold brewed.

822
00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:10.740
Yeah.

823
00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:11.740
We've got some in the back,

824
00:18:11.741 --> 00:18:12.571
so I'm cold brewed.

825
00:18:12.571 --> 00:18:14.900
Caveman is crazy cold brew coffees.

826
00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:15.271
Interesting.

827
00:18:15.271 --> 00:18:16.950
It takes a long time to make apparently,

828
00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:17.700
cause yeah,

829
00:18:17.700 --> 00:18:18.990
when they run out they don't make anymore.

830
00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:19.261
I'm like,

831
00:18:19.261 --> 00:18:20.650
what do you mean you're not making any more?

832
00:18:20.651 --> 00:18:22.910
I thought he just took regular coffee and made it to call.

833
00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:23.431
No,

834
00:18:23.431 --> 00:18:24.570
it's not ice coffee.

835
00:18:24.590 --> 00:18:24.900
Yeah,

836
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:27.090
no brew tastes totally different.

837
00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:28.050
What's the difference?

838
00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:32.430
You just have to talk to Tate about the process but it takes hours.

839
00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:33.091
It does.

840
00:18:33.091 --> 00:18:34.720
It's not something that takes like,

841
00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:37.170
like you pour the hot water and you mix it in.

842
00:18:37.171 --> 00:18:39.340
Like if you use like a French press is what?

843
00:18:39.341 --> 00:18:40.230
Which we use.

844
00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:40.580
Yeah.

845
00:18:40.580 --> 00:18:41.580
You use a French press,

846
00:18:41.581 --> 00:18:45.210
you pour the water and you wait less than two minutes and then you press it and

847
00:18:45.211 --> 00:18:46.650
pour it and then the coffee's ready.

848
00:18:46.890 --> 00:18:47.730
But with that shit,

849
00:18:47.731 --> 00:18:48.750
that cold brew stuff,

850
00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:49.321
you have to,

851
00:18:49.321 --> 00:18:50.220
it takes a long time.

852
00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:50.491
Yeah.

853
00:18:50.491 --> 00:18:52.260
Cause once they're out for the day they're out.

854
00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:52.921
Do you want some?

855
00:18:52.921 --> 00:18:53.754
We have some.

856
00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:54.660
We have any back there.

857
00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:55.770
I'll take some home with me.

858
00:18:55.771 --> 00:18:56.390
I won't take anybody.

859
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:58.740
So I'm good with this one.

860
00:18:58.800 --> 00:18:59.560
Okay.

861
00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:01.110
I've already had the one fucking coffee.

862
00:19:01.111 --> 00:19:01.831
I'm going to be wired.

863
00:19:01.831 --> 00:19:03.120
I'm going to give us some cups.

864
00:19:03.121 --> 00:19:03.391
Jamie.

865
00:19:03.391 --> 00:19:04.230
Let me try that shit.

866
00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:07.380
Let me figure out what the fuck the differences and I switched to American

867
00:19:07.420 --> 00:19:12.420
instead of a ice coffee and that's a huge difference at Americana is a espresso

868
00:19:12.781 --> 00:19:13.830
just mixed with water.

869
00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:15.090
We're an ice coffee.

870
00:19:15.091 --> 00:19:17.460
It's just brewed like regular coffee but stronger.

871
00:19:17.490 --> 00:19:19.590
What's the difference between an American and a Kimora?

872
00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:20.473
Come on guys.

873
00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:22.470
It's a paintbrush.

874
00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:23.820
Um,

875
00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:25.020
the uh,

876
00:19:25.021 --> 00:19:26.100
the Americanos,

877
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:27.470
his tastes watery me,

878
00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:29.130
I would just ask for half the water.

879
00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:29.761
Oh really?

880
00:19:29.761 --> 00:19:30.330
Yeah.

881
00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:32.070
I like Espressos and I like coffee,

882
00:19:32.071 --> 00:19:33.150
but I don't like Americanos.

883
00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:34.440
I always like the Chai.

884
00:19:34.830 --> 00:19:36.060
Chai is an Indian guy.

885
00:19:36.340 --> 00:19:37.160
Tried to,

886
00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:37.501
let's see.

887
00:19:37.501 --> 00:19:39.060
Chai means tea in Indian,

888
00:19:39.061 --> 00:19:40.380
so we won't be saying Chai Tea.

889
00:19:40.740 --> 00:19:42.640
It's like saying really know,

890
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:43.690
trying to just meet tea.

891
00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:44.581
We're so dumb.

892
00:19:44.581 --> 00:19:45.450
We don't even give a fuck.

893
00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:48.750
We already explained that to Starbucks and like what the fuck ever.

894
00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.010
Why you still talking to us?

895
00:19:50.011 --> 00:19:51.000
We're making money here.

896
00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.370
I almost have to ask for an extra pump.

897
00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:55.290
An extra pump of Chai.

898
00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:55.980
Yeah.

899
00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:57.040
And My Chai Tea,

900
00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:58.290
coffee bean makes it better.

901
00:19:58.291 --> 00:20:01.080
They actually use the spices and they make it the right way.

902
00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:01.501
Oh.

903
00:20:01.501 --> 00:20:04.350
So Starbucks is using some sort of liquid?

904
00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:04.801
Yeah,

905
00:20:04.801 --> 00:20:06.000
some sort of liquid shit.

906
00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:06.331
See,

907
00:20:06.331 --> 00:20:10.020
caveman sells it in these containers and they ship it to you cold.

908
00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:10.980
So like,

909
00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:11.401
look at that.

910
00:20:11.401 --> 00:20:12.210
It looks like this.

911
00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:15.300
It looks like a fucking spray can like you look like a propane container.

912
00:20:15.301 --> 00:20:15.481
Yeah.

913
00:20:15.481 --> 00:20:16.314
Like a spray paint.

914
00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:17.203
I'm like,

915
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:19.380
yeah,

916
00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:21.450
this is a cause if you drink too much of that,

917
00:20:21.451 --> 00:20:22.530
you're going to tag the bathroom,

918
00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:24.480
which is like a cold brew concentrate.

919
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:24.930
Oh,

920
00:20:24.930 --> 00:20:25.860
this is concentrated.

921
00:20:25.861 --> 00:20:27.210
So we need to add water to this.

922
00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:30.210
Three waters to warm your coffee.

923
00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:30.790
There you go.

924
00:20:30.790 --> 00:20:31.230
Okay.

925
00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:31.840
Tell him to do it.

926
00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.750
Just do it straight and see what it tastes like.

927
00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:34.031
Yeah,

928
00:20:34.031 --> 00:20:34.864
that's a good idea.

929
00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:36.330
Can we get a red bull?

930
00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:37.950
It's probably like lethal.

931
00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:38.993
Yeah.

932
00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:40.950
So Russell peed is,

933
00:20:40.951 --> 00:20:41.820
what's the latest?

934
00:20:41.821 --> 00:20:43.770
I see you got a special coming out with my friends.

935
00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:43.981
No,

936
00:20:43.981 --> 00:20:44.461
I don't.

937
00:20:44.461 --> 00:20:45.450
Or You just did a special,

938
00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:45.631
no,

939
00:20:45.631 --> 00:20:45.751
no,

940
00:20:45.751 --> 00:20:46.584
I'm on tour.

941
00:20:47.190 --> 00:20:47.771
What was this?

942
00:20:47.771 --> 00:20:48.160
Uh,

943
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.330
I saw something.

944
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:50.463
Um,

945
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:51.851
oh no,

946
00:20:51.851 --> 00:20:52.684
it wasn't special.

947
00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:53.770
It was a,

948
00:20:54.190 --> 00:20:57.640
there's like some interview with you that I was watching where people were,

949
00:20:57.641 --> 00:20:58.181
they were saying,

950
00:20:58.181 --> 00:20:59.014
how come you're,

951
00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:02.710
how come people don't know you but you're so famous.

952
00:21:02.711 --> 00:21:03.810
They were trying to figure out something.

953
00:21:03.830 --> 00:21:04.061
I'm like,

954
00:21:04.061 --> 00:21:07.150
what are you talking like maybe the people you're not hanging around with.

955
00:21:07.180 --> 00:21:07.660
I'm like,

956
00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:11.230
Russell Peters sells out the fucking o two arena in London two nights in a row.

957
00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:13.270
You sell out these giant ass places.

958
00:21:13.271 --> 00:21:16.180
And I was watching this person interview you and they were saying like,

959
00:21:16.181 --> 00:21:17.410
well how come you're not more known?

960
00:21:17.411 --> 00:21:17.801
And you're like,

961
00:21:17.801 --> 00:21:18.634
what are you

962
00:21:18.910 --> 00:21:19.671
<v 3>the fuck he wants?</v>

963
00:21:19.671 --> 00:21:20.231
And it's funny,

964
00:21:20.231 --> 00:21:20.740
I I,

965
00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:22.690
that's why the tour is called almost famous.

966
00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:23.051
Oh,

967
00:21:23.051 --> 00:21:23.680
that's what you call it.

968
00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:24.513
Yeah.

969
00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:27.370
That was probably why she was bringing this up.

970
00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:27.611
Yeah.

971
00:21:27.611 --> 00:21:28.480
I remember when I was doing,

972
00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:32.800
I was doing good day New York a couple of weeks ago when I was there promoting,

973
00:21:32.801 --> 00:21:34.030
cause I was doing Madison Square Garden.

974
00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:36.600
<v 2>It's a whole bunch of fucking,</v>

975
00:21:36.601 --> 00:21:39.060
it's a whole process to get that coffee open just as weird dude.

976
00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:40.170
It's like a pull tab.

977
00:21:40.171 --> 00:21:40.650
I'm sorry.

978
00:21:40.650 --> 00:21:41.730
<v 3>Got It now.</v>

979
00:21:41.731 --> 00:21:45.250
So I was doing good day New York and there were like end of the morning show be

980
00:21:45.251 --> 00:21:47.370
but like so almost famous.

981
00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:48.540
I mean come on,

982
00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:49.890
you're already famous.

983
00:21:49.891 --> 00:21:50.061
I go,

984
00:21:50.061 --> 00:21:52.850
if I was famous I'd be on Good Morning America right now.

985
00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:54.720
I'm fucking good day.

986
00:21:54.721 --> 00:21:55.554
New York

987
00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:56.940
<v 2>is that famous?</v>

988
00:21:56.941 --> 00:22:00.030
Like it's like there's certain levels of fame like you have to be famous to get

989
00:22:00.031 --> 00:22:00.121
on.

990
00:22:00.121 --> 00:22:01.050
Good Day New York,

991
00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.120
but you've got to be really fucking famous.

992
00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:05.580
You can be mediocrely famous on good.

993
00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:09.300
And I say I submit to you that you really want to be on good day,

994
00:22:09.301 --> 00:22:11.100
New York and not on Good Morning America.

995
00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:13.260
Cause if you're famous enough to be on good morning America,

996
00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:15.180
you're probably getting annoyed.

997
00:22:15.181 --> 00:22:16.920
More like people were probably like,

998
00:22:17.010 --> 00:22:18.810
like Tom Cruise would be on good morning.

999
00:22:18.811 --> 00:22:21.150
America doesn't fucking dude can't go to the store.

1000
00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.400
Do you think Tom Cruise can go to the grocery store?

1001
00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:24.151
Probably.

1002
00:22:24.151 --> 00:22:26.790
Cause I think he's deceptively short and people aren't expecting that.

1003
00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:28.473
Um,

1004
00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:29.910
Danny devito short,

1005
00:22:30.290 --> 00:22:30.580
do you think?

1006
00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:34.200
See I heard he's pretty short a top gun too.

1007
00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:37.110
I think people say that shit probably because they're jealous.

1008
00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:40.680
I heard these five seven that's not what Jay Moore says.

1009
00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:41.000
Well,

1010
00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.780
you're more studies five nine Oh really?

1011
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:45.690
But Jay mom never known what that dude,

1012
00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:47.340
how tall is Tom Cruise?

1013
00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:48.990
Siri doesn't know shit.

1014
00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:51.820
<v 3>Tom Cruise is five feet seven inches tall.</v>

1015
00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:53.680
It's a pretty sweet.

1016
00:22:53.681 --> 00:22:54.400
He's my eye.

1017
00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:55.450
How weird is Siri?

1018
00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:57.340
What does sharing all of that?

1019
00:22:57.550 --> 00:22:58.383
Why did I know?

1020
00:22:58.540 --> 00:22:58.961
First of all,

1021
00:22:58.961 --> 00:22:59.794
why the fuck did I know?

1022
00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:01.180
Nevermind Siri.

1023
00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:02.440
But Siri,

1024
00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:02.770
Siri

1025
00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:04.050
<v 2>can actually answer that now.</v>

1026
00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:07.110
Before Siri would like send you to Google now,

1027
00:23:07.111 --> 00:23:08.280
like an answer.

1028
00:23:08.281 --> 00:23:10.560
Like she answers with their voice crazy how fast you did.

1029
00:23:10.590 --> 00:23:11.940
It's much more improved.

1030
00:23:11.941 --> 00:23:13.680
Right series actually useful.

1031
00:23:13.681 --> 00:23:14.490

1036
00:23:27.501 --> 00:23:28.334

See if she knows.

1041
00:23:32.450 --> 00:23:33.810
We're trying to figure out if you're famous.

1061
00:24:08.581 --> 00:24:09.414
It's famous.

1062
00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:11.240
Wait,

1063
00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.270
they're not famous.

1064
00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:14.490

1066
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:17.811
Oh,

1067
00:24:17.811 --> 00:24:18.021
okay.

1068
00:24:18.021 --> 00:24:18.771
That doesn't make sense.

1069
00:24:18.771 --> 00:24:19.604
You know what it is.

1070
00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:21.650
Everyone knows Tom Cruise does five feet,

1071
00:24:21.740 --> 00:24:22.640
10 inches tall.

1072
00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:24.173
Perfect.

1073
00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:26.540
Kanye West is famous.

1074
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:28.340
Kanye West is famous.

1075
00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:29.690
That's the difference.

1076
00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.530
That's insane.

1077
00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:32.750
One you call Siri and you say,

1078
00:24:32.751 --> 00:24:34.070
how tall is Brian?

1079
00:24:34.071 --> 00:24:35.630
Red Bat and Siri says,

1080
00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:37.430
Brian Redman is five feet,

1081
00:24:37.431 --> 00:24:38.270
eight inches tall.

1082
00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:39.280
<v 2>Then it's time to quit.</v>

1083
00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:40.060
Yeah,

1084
00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:41.080
cause then you got two famous.

1085
00:24:41.081 --> 00:24:41.650
You fucked up.

1086
00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:41.800
Yeah,

1087
00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:42.401
we're all,

1088
00:24:42.401 --> 00:24:44.300
I think we're all at the right amount of family.

1089
00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:45.370
We're under the wire.

1090
00:24:45.371 --> 00:24:46.091
That's where you want to be.

1091
00:24:46.091 --> 00:24:46.960
You want to be under the wire.

1092
00:24:46.961 --> 00:24:47.350
You want to,

1093
00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:50.800
you don't want to be that fucking dude that's no out there.

1094
00:24:50.801 --> 00:24:53.820
John Travolta in it at Nice Hodgepodge.

1095
00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:56.470
Worse at nighttime after his wife goes to sleep.

1096
00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:57.160
Yeah.

1097
00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:57.950
Maybe.

1098
00:24:57.950 --> 00:24:59.110
Maybe they have an arrangement.

1099
00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:00.153
I think they do.

1100
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:01.543
You think?

1101
00:25:02.050 --> 00:25:02.350
Yeah,

1102
00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:03.670
probably one of the down there in Florida.

1103
00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:04.990
Yeah.

1104
00:25:04.990 --> 00:25:05.560
Yeah.

1105
00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:06.393
Rocking it.

1106
00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:07.393
Rocking at Florida.

1107
00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:08.650
Things are happening over there for them.

1108
00:25:10.570 --> 00:25:14.230
I've only heard Florida is a different different world and were talking about

1109
00:25:14.231 --> 00:25:14.960
that last night too,

1110
00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:15.251
aren't we?

1111
00:25:15.251 --> 00:25:16.210
It's a different world.

1112
00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:17.290
It's a totally different world.

1113
00:25:17.640 --> 00:25:18.520
There were wild people,

1114
00:25:18.521 --> 00:25:19.060
man.

1115
00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:21.700
There's a lot of stupid shit like you'd see in the news like you were following

1116
00:25:21.701 --> 00:25:23.080
the Florida man Twitter feed.

1117
00:25:23.410 --> 00:25:23.681
No.

1118
00:25:23.681 --> 00:25:24.280
What is this?

1119
00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:24.371
Oh,

1120
00:25:24.371 --> 00:25:25.180
it's awesome.

1121
00:25:25.180 --> 00:25:25.680
Florida.

1122
00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:27.520
I'm finding some of the fucking hilarious.

1123
00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:29.680
It's all things that a man in Florida,

1124
00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:31.300
it's gotten arrested for recently.

1125
00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:33.700
They keep a track of all the rest,

1126
00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:35.980
man.

1127
00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:36.460
Twitter.

1128
00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:36.940
Yeah.

1129
00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:37.773
Here it is.

1130
00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:39.670
This Florida woman as well.

1131
00:25:39.671 --> 00:25:40.310
By the way,

1132
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.500
the,

1133
00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:40.780
the,

1134
00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:41.441
the tweet,

1135
00:25:41.441 --> 00:25:44.050
the guy on the front has tattoos all over his face.

1136
00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:48.950
Cops pull up to find Florida.

1137
00:25:48.951 --> 00:25:52.250
Man pointed a gun at naked neighbor over loud music.

1138
00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:58.370
It's like they always say Florida man vandalizes psychic girlfriend's car after

1139
00:25:58.371 --> 00:26:01.250
she tells him dead grandmother will return to rape him in his sleep.

1140
00:26:03.530 --> 00:26:05.480
I mean if you're dead grandmother was going to come back.

1141
00:26:05.660 --> 00:26:07.010
I mean she's going to come back to do that.

1142
00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:07.641
Yeah,

1143
00:26:07.641 --> 00:26:08.210
it's just a,

1144
00:26:08.210 --> 00:26:10.130
it's a super entertaining Twitter feed.

1145
00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:12.380
Another one is a stripper genius.

1146
00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:13.011
Have you,

1147
00:26:13.011 --> 00:26:14.450
have you ever read stripper genius?

1148
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:15.130
No,

1149
00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:16.580
I'm missing out a lot in my,

1150
00:26:16.581 --> 00:26:20.800
on my social media now and just very limited stripper gene.

1151
00:26:20.801 --> 00:26:22.190
This is also true.

1152
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:24.830
It's like people who work in strip clubs,

1153
00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:28.310
they like here things that are hilarious and then put them on store per do they

1154
00:26:28.311 --> 00:26:29.540
send them to strip a genius.

1155
00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:31.611
We started,

1156
00:26:31.611 --> 00:26:32.810
we started a couple of them,

1157
00:26:32.811 --> 00:26:34.520
my friends and I and then we just abandoned them.

1158
00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:35.810
A band.

1159
00:26:35.810 --> 00:26:36.950
You get started some fake ones?

1160
00:26:36.970 --> 00:26:37.340
Yeah.

1161
00:26:37.340 --> 00:26:37.570
What,

1162
00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:37.731
what?

1163
00:26:37.731 --> 00:26:38.241
What'd you have?

1164
00:26:38.241 --> 00:26:39.110
One is a,

1165
00:26:39.860 --> 00:26:41.360
one was a fuck,

1166
00:26:41.361 --> 00:26:42.194
what was it called?

1167
00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:45.420
It like wrong tweets or something and just like we were just,

1168
00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:47.100
anytime a disaster would happen,

1169
00:26:47.101 --> 00:26:49.600
we would send out like some sort of a,

1170
00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:50.820
it was called off color tweets.

1171
00:26:50.821 --> 00:26:51.600
We started,

1172
00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:52.171
have you ever read?

1173
00:26:52.171 --> 00:26:52.411
Yes.

1174
00:26:52.411 --> 00:26:53.244
You're racist.

1175
00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:53.621
No,

1176
00:26:53.621 --> 00:26:54.120
no.

1177
00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:54.421
Yes,

1178
00:26:54.421 --> 00:26:55.710
you're racist is really good.

1179
00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:59.580
They find like Super Racist Shit that people tweet like I'm not racist,

1180
00:26:59.581 --> 00:27:00.230
but,

1181
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:03.450
and then they'll say something to fucking racist and so yes,

1182
00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:04.890
they're a shitty disclaimer.

1183
00:27:05.250 --> 00:27:05.641
Yeah,

1184
00:27:05.641 --> 00:27:06.211
exactly.

1185
00:27:06.211 --> 00:27:06.481
Yes.

1186
00:27:06.481 --> 00:27:09.420
You're racist was going off during the Ferguson riots.

1187
00:27:09.840 --> 00:27:10.531
That's a,

1188
00:27:10.531 --> 00:27:11.640
that's like I'm not gay,

1189
00:27:11.641 --> 00:27:12.930
but you know.

1190
00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:14.063
Yeah.

1191
00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:14.341
See,

1192
00:27:14.341 --> 00:27:15.390
these are really fun,

1193
00:27:15.391 --> 00:27:16.224
man.

1194
00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.330
Oh listen to this.

1195
00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:20.160
I'm not trying to be racist,

1196
00:27:20.161 --> 00:27:21.750
but come the fuck on.

1197
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:24.930
Why did we end segregation if this would be the outcome

1198
00:27:29.210 --> 00:27:31.380
that kid last night on the,

1199
00:27:31.480 --> 00:27:32.313
uh,

1200
00:27:33.530 --> 00:27:34.650
the chocolate milk kid.

1201
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:35.850
This is hilarious.

1202
00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:38.910
He are treated with what the actual fuck.

1203
00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:45.660
Wta F not trying to sound racist,

1204
00:27:45.661 --> 00:27:48.900
but why is a black girl with black hair playing Annie?

1205
00:27:50.490 --> 00:27:51.180
Wow.

1206
00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:53.250
They can't even let fictional characters change.

1207
00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:54.211
Well,

1208
00:27:54.211 --> 00:27:54.460
it was,

1209
00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:54.660
what,

1210
00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:55.170
who was it?

1211
00:27:55.170 --> 00:27:55.891
Who's mad at,

1212
00:27:55.891 --> 00:27:56.570
uh,

1213
00:27:56.570 --> 00:27:58.080
the Black James Bond coming out?

1214
00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:59.250
A lot of people,

1215
00:27:59.350 --> 00:28:00.183
all the man,

1216
00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:02.310
Idris Elba is going to be the new black.

1217
00:28:02.311 --> 00:28:02.490
I mean,

1218
00:28:02.490 --> 00:28:03.001
he's British.

1219
00:28:03.001 --> 00:28:03.500
It's all about,

1220
00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.070
isn't that all the criteria should be,

1221
00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:06.030
you should just be British.

1222
00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:06.160
Well,

1223
00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:09.010
it sucks because that Daniel Craig was the best one ever seen.

1224
00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:09.421
Great.

1225
00:28:09.421 --> 00:28:10.254
He was great.

1226
00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:11.183
He was a killer.

1227
00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.450
I believe that he was like,

1228
00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:14.190
he was the first guy believed at all.

1229
00:28:14.191 --> 00:28:15.420
I never believe Roger Moore.

1230
00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:16.570
Roger Moe was a little lightness.

1231
00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:17.453
Loafers.

1232
00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.200
Sean Connery was back in the day.

1233
00:28:19.201 --> 00:28:21.000
Was it different sort of character,

1234
00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:24.330
but like the kind of guy that Daniel Craig played,

1235
00:28:24.331 --> 00:28:25.860
like I really believed it was actually him.

1236
00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:26.700
Yeah.

1237
00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:26.911
Yeah.

1238
00:28:26.911 --> 00:28:28.090
Rush Limbaugh rush.

1239
00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:29.881
Oh,

1240
00:28:29.881 --> 00:28:31.380
he went crazy about black bond.

1241
00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:33.203
What does he give a shit?

1242
00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:35.820
He's not even fuck you rush.

1243
00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:36.090
What he,

1244
00:28:36.090 --> 00:28:36.210
what?

1245
00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:36.840
He can't.

1246
00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:39.480
Why can't they make two at the same time?

1247
00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:40.710
One with a black guy,

1248
00:28:40.711 --> 00:28:41.544
one with a white guy.

1249
00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:42.160
What are you good?

1250
00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:45.240
He who gives a fuck want to be a chick to be James Bond.

1251
00:28:45.241 --> 00:28:46.380
One could be James bail bond.

1252
00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:47.393
Margaret Cho.

1253
00:28:47.490 --> 00:28:48.960
Margaret Cho as James Bond.

1254
00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:49.621
It's just,

1255
00:28:49.621 --> 00:28:50.161
that's her name.

1256
00:28:50.161 --> 00:28:52.290
Her name's James Bond or fucking parents are crazy.

1257
00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:53.640
The name of James Bond.

1258
00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:54.451
She's angry.

1259
00:28:54.451 --> 00:28:55.350
She's had to kick some ass.

1260
00:28:55.351 --> 00:28:57.450
She works for the European secret service.

1261
00:28:57.451 --> 00:28:58.590
Just happened to be Korean.

1262
00:28:59.460 --> 00:28:59.641
Yeah.

1263
00:28:59.641 --> 00:29:00.210
They don't like,

1264
00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:01.290
they don't like change.

1265
00:29:01.291 --> 00:29:02.520
People don't like change.

1266
00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:04.140
What did Russell say or what did,

1267
00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.010
um,

1268
00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:09.600
<v 6>he says that James Bond is a white and Scottish.</v>

1269
00:29:09.601 --> 00:29:11.070
That's who James Bond is.

1270
00:29:11.071 --> 00:29:13.470
I know it's racist to probably even point this out.

1271
00:29:13.590 --> 00:29:17.490
And then he said Daniel Craig wasn't Scottish excellence in broadcasting,

1272
00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:19.440
but the franchise needs to get with it.

1273
00:29:19.441 --> 00:29:19.741
Right.

1274
00:29:19.741 --> 00:29:20.920
He continued the franchise.

1275
00:29:20.921 --> 00:29:21.661
It needs to be hip.

1276
00:29:21.661 --> 00:29:23.970
The franchise needs to get with the 21st century.

1277
00:29:23.971 --> 00:29:24.481
That's right.

1278
00:29:24.481 --> 00:29:27.750
We had 50 years of white bonds because bonds is white.

1279
00:29:27.780 --> 00:29:29.610
Barn is was never black.

1280
00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:32.700
<v 2>That just seems very stupid thinking.</v>

1281
00:29:32.730 --> 00:29:33.960
Not to sound racist,

1282
00:29:33.961 --> 00:29:35.310
but I hate when black bitches.

1283
00:29:35.311 --> 00:29:35.701
Thank you.

1284
00:29:35.701 --> 00:29:37.440
Supposed to be scared of them.

1285
00:29:37.441 --> 00:29:37.740
Like,

1286
00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:38.140
bitch,

1287
00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:39.180
I will pop you.

1288
00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:42.293
I mean,

1289
00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:45.940
<v 3>I think black bitches is already a bad start to that sentence.</v>

1290
00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:48.990
<v 7>If cops are out to kill black people,</v>

1291
00:29:48.991 --> 00:29:51.150
why are so many murderers alive in prison?

1292
00:29:54.060 --> 00:29:54.893
Oh my God.

1293
00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:56.161
Yeah,

1294
00:29:56.161 --> 00:29:56.510
there's,

1295
00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:57.900
there's a lot of the man,

1296
00:29:58.290 --> 00:29:59.610
I like twisted logic.

1297
00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:00.620
These,

1298
00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:04.170
this is actually the real problem with reading these things.

1299
00:30:04.171 --> 00:30:05.550
As you go down a rabbit hole,

1300
00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:06.780
when you go to like,

1301
00:30:06.781 --> 00:30:07.051
yes,

1302
00:30:07.051 --> 00:30:08.160
you're racist or something like that,

1303
00:30:08.161 --> 00:30:11.370
and you go down a rabbit hole because you'll find someone that writes something

1304
00:30:11.371 --> 00:30:12.220
really racist.

1305
00:30:12.221 --> 00:30:13.350
Then you go what?

1306
00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:16.440
And then you click on their page and you go to their page like,

1307
00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:16.741
Oh,

1308
00:30:16.741 --> 00:30:18.450
fucking Christ.

1309
00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:21.360
And it's all just racist shit.

1310
00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:24.750
It's just like all this fucking dumb racist shit.

1311
00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:27.130
And then you see the people that they're retweet and go,

1312
00:30:27.150 --> 00:30:27.983
let me see this.

1313
00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:29.040
Oh Great.

1314
00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:29.971
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

1315
00:30:29.971 --> 00:30:30.051
they,

1316
00:30:30.051 --> 00:30:30.884
they don't have a,

1317
00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:32.113
uh,

1318
00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.830
a deep swimming pool of intelligence happening there.

1319
00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:35.201
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

1320
00:30:35.201 --> 00:30:36.310
This is a bad one.

1321
00:30:36.311 --> 00:30:36.790
Woo.

1322
00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:37.840
I just went down a bad one.

1323
00:30:37.841 --> 00:30:37.991
See,

1324
00:30:37.991 --> 00:30:38.770
I just did it.

1325
00:30:38.770 --> 00:30:39.340
And if you,

1326
00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:40.780
if you go down these things,

1327
00:30:40.781 --> 00:30:42.190
he'd go and read these PE.

1328
00:30:42.191 --> 00:30:43.024
It's like,

1329
00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:44.740
how do you fix that fucking guy?

1330
00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:45.071
You know?

1331
00:30:45.071 --> 00:30:47.440
How do you fix the guy who's that fucking racist?

1332
00:30:47.940 --> 00:30:48.671
<v 3>Is that racist?</v>

1333
00:30:48.671 --> 00:30:50.260
And the problem is now they have outlets.

1334
00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:51.540
Exactly two minute,

1335
00:30:51.541 --> 00:30:54.100
too many fucking mental cases have outlets nowadays.

1336
00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:56.660
<v 7>And that there's a weird free expression thing.</v>

1337
00:30:56.661 --> 00:30:56.871
Like,

1338
00:30:56.871 --> 00:30:57.051
I mean,

1339
00:30:57.051 --> 00:31:01.370
you could kind of do whatever you want as long as you're not saying hate speech,

1340
00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:02.870
hate speech.

1341
00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:04.010
If you're,

1342
00:31:04.010 --> 00:31:05.900
if you're saying derogatory,

1343
00:31:05.901 --> 00:31:06.651
negative things.

1344
00:31:06.651 --> 00:31:08.650
Or is it only hate speech if you're,

1345
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:09.150
uh,

1346
00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:11.690
if you're saying that there should be violence against them.

1347
00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:13.090
<v 3>I Dunno,</v>

1348
00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:13.331
it's,

1349
00:31:13.331 --> 00:31:16.000
it's a tough call and depends on who you ask in that one.

1350
00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:16.391
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

1351
00:31:16.391 --> 00:31:18.070
I mean it's obviously racist,

1352
00:31:18.071 --> 00:31:18.550
right?

1353
00:31:18.550 --> 00:31:23.110
But at what point would they remove it from a website for being dangerous or

1354
00:31:23.111 --> 00:31:24.790
inflammatory or,

1355
00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:25.850
or all of it.

1356
00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:27.100
It comes inflammatory.

1357
00:31:27.101 --> 00:31:28.330
Railey flammatory yeah,

1358
00:31:28.331 --> 00:31:28.960
for sure.

1359
00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.070
But it like what point?

1360
00:31:30.071 --> 00:31:30.281
Like,

1361
00:31:30.281 --> 00:31:30.491
you know,

1362
00:31:30.491 --> 00:31:32.200
like you can't threaten someone.

1363
00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:33.131
You can't say,

1364
00:31:33.131 --> 00:31:33.371
you know,

1365
00:31:33.371 --> 00:31:35.620
I will come to your house and I will fucking kill you.

1366
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:36.700
You can't say that.

1367
00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:37.641
But you can see,

1368
00:31:37.641 --> 00:31:38.830
I can say somebody should.

1369
00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:39.581
Yeah.

1370
00:31:39.581 --> 00:31:39.941
You can say,

1371
00:31:39.941 --> 00:31:40.061
Oh,

1372
00:31:40.061 --> 00:31:41.740
Mike is a fucking moron.

1373
00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:44.230
I'm so tired of his stupid shit he sold.

1374
00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:45.370
No one could stop that,

1375
00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:49.690
but can you say all white people like Mike are fucking morons and I'm tired of

1376
00:31:49.691 --> 00:31:50.130
this shit.

1377
00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:51.240
You right.

1378
00:31:51.340 --> 00:31:51.701
You can't.

1379
00:31:51.701 --> 00:31:52.010
Right.

1380
00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:52.480
Okay.

1381
00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:53.710
Most people will let that slide.

1382
00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:54.820
But if you start saying like,

1383
00:31:54.821 --> 00:31:58.390
all black people are fucking morons and you put that on a website like,

1384
00:31:58.840 --> 00:31:59.320
whoa,

1385
00:31:59.320 --> 00:31:59.621
okay,

1386
00:31:59.621 --> 00:32:00.190
what's going on?

1387
00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:00.641
Like what?

1388
00:32:00.641 --> 00:32:01.840
Where do we allow like,

1389
00:32:01.841 --> 00:32:03.340
and then you start using slurs,

1390
00:32:03.341 --> 00:32:04.240
all niggers,

1391
00:32:04.241 --> 00:32:05.710
all those specs,

1392
00:32:05.711 --> 00:32:06.071
all,

1393
00:32:06.071 --> 00:32:06.281
you know,

1394
00:32:06.281 --> 00:32:07.780
you start going down that road.

1395
00:32:07.870 --> 00:32:12.870
All kikes I seen a lot of antisemitic shit online when the Israel thing was

1396
00:32:13.871 --> 00:32:14.361
going down.

1397
00:32:14.361 --> 00:32:16.030
When the Israel Palestine thing was going down,

1398
00:32:16.270 --> 00:32:17.590
a lot of people were angry for sure.

1399
00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:18.780
I mean there's obviously,

1400
00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:19.900
it was a horrible,

1401
00:32:19.901 --> 00:32:23.710
tragic situation to have these country's at war and all these people,

1402
00:32:23.711 --> 00:32:24.550
innocent people dying.

1403
00:32:24.551 --> 00:32:27.550
But God damn that I read a lot of fucking antisemitic shit.

1404
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:28.320
<v 3>No,</v>

1405
00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:29.153
it's fine.

1406
00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:32.290
You know what the ironic part about that that is,

1407
00:32:32.291 --> 00:32:32.981
is that a,

1408
00:32:32.981 --> 00:32:35.820
they're both Semites that is true,

1409
00:32:35.821 --> 00:32:36.060
right?

1410
00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:37.560
They are both semiautomatic religion.

1411
00:32:37.570 --> 00:32:38.403
Yeah.

1412
00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:42.920
So when you're being antisemetic now you got to decipher the white ones are the

1413
00:32:42.921 --> 00:32:43.521
brown ones,

1414
00:32:43.521 --> 00:32:44.200
you know.

1415
00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:44.820
<v 2>Well now he did.</v>

1416
00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:49.820
He had a bit about that in 2006 in my shiny happy jihad that if you watch,

1417
00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:54.460
if you watch like Israel and Palestine and TV,

1418
00:32:54.461 --> 00:32:55.810
it's hard to figure out who the fuck is who.

1419
00:32:56.030 --> 00:32:56.350
Yeah,

1420
00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:56.621
I go,

1421
00:32:56.621 --> 00:32:59.560
you got a brown skin dude with darker hair,

1422
00:32:59.561 --> 00:33:03.250
throwing rocks at a brown skinned dude with dark curly hair holding a machine

1423
00:33:03.251 --> 00:33:03.490
gun.

1424
00:33:03.490 --> 00:33:07.310
Like how the fuck the higher powered ones are?

1425
00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:09.190
Our U s backed,

1426
00:33:09.270 --> 00:33:10.350
he compared it to the uh,

1427
00:33:11.020 --> 00:33:11.853
sisters.

1428
00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:12.911
Oh Yeah,

1429
00:33:12.911 --> 00:33:13.744
the William Sisters,

1430
00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.290
the Williams sisters play.

1431
00:33:15.370 --> 00:33:16.330
I can't tell who's who.

1432
00:33:17.130 --> 00:33:18.100
One of them is bigger.

1433
00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:18.910
Yeah.

1434
00:33:18.910 --> 00:33:20.260
One of them is more clydesdale,

1435
00:33:22.930 --> 00:33:24.280
bigger media ass.

1436
00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:25.833
Good Lord.

1437
00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:30.760
One comes from great horse stock from fantastic athletics stock.

1438
00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:31.421
Do you,

1439
00:33:31.421 --> 00:33:33.310
would you ever be into dating?

1440
00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:35.620
Like a really powerful chick like that?

1441
00:33:36.010 --> 00:33:36.970
I could check that.

1442
00:33:36.971 --> 00:33:38.220
Like you,

1443
00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:38.740
if the,

1444
00:33:38.740 --> 00:33:40.330
if there was someone chasing you,

1445
00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:41.243
she would outrun you.

1446
00:33:41.410 --> 00:33:42.850
Could you rule out run Serena Williams?

1447
00:33:42.910 --> 00:33:43.210
No.

1448
00:33:43.210 --> 00:33:43.421
No,

1449
00:33:43.421 --> 00:33:44.254
not with those funds.

1450
00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:46.590
I couldn't imagine it.

1451
00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:49.090
I bet she could outrun most men.

1452
00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:49.930
Right?

1453
00:33:49.930 --> 00:33:50.141
I mean,

1454
00:33:50.141 --> 00:33:50.860
if you had to.

1455
00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:51.280
Oh yeah.

1456
00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:52.370
That's a factor in

1457
00:33:53.090 --> 00:33:54.580
<v 3>she's an athlete and,</v>

1458
00:33:54.581 --> 00:33:56.030
and if you're not an athlete,

1459
00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:56.291
yeah,

1460
00:33:56.291 --> 00:33:58.010
well you might as well let her win that race.

1461
00:33:58.530 --> 00:33:59.470
It's worst.

1462
00:33:59.471 --> 00:34:01.430
I think if you're dating an athlete and she's,

1463
00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:03.230
and you're a comic and she's funnier than you,

1464
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:04.183
then that's bad.

1465
00:34:05.390 --> 00:34:07.000
That's really where you're going to draw the line.

1466
00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:07.963
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1467
00:34:08.630 --> 00:34:11.000
I know dudes who's girlfriends are just as funny as they are,

1468
00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:13.490
would they don't do comedy and you're like,

1469
00:34:13.491 --> 00:34:13.821
damn,

1470
00:34:13.821 --> 00:34:14.654
dude,

1471
00:34:16.070 --> 00:34:16.660
maybe no,

1472
00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:17.820
maybe they can't just figure it out.

1473
00:34:18.160 --> 00:34:19.560
And that's what the guy keeps arounds.

1474
00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:20.990
You think it's way harder for a check.

1475
00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:22.693
Yeah.

1476
00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:22.971
Wait,

1477
00:34:22.971 --> 00:34:23.540
harder for chicken.

1478
00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:23.961
Do comedy.

1479
00:34:23.961 --> 00:34:24.170
Right.

1480
00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:25.610
<v 3>It's not harder for them to do it.</v>

1481
00:34:25.611 --> 00:34:27.160
It's harder for the audience to accept it,

1482
00:34:27.161 --> 00:34:27.890
but I think,

1483
00:34:27.890 --> 00:34:29.900
I think that that time is passing now too,

1484
00:34:29.901 --> 00:34:34.650
because there's been enough funny women out there consistently enough that that

1485
00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:35.513
that you don't do the,

1486
00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:35.900
Oh,

1487
00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:36.733
fuck a chick.

1488
00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:37.350
Yeah.

1489
00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:37.670
I remember,

1490
00:34:37.670 --> 00:34:40.790
I remember when I started 25 years ago when a girl would walk on stage and we're

1491
00:34:40.791 --> 00:34:40.960
like,

1492
00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:41.390
oh,

1493
00:34:41.390 --> 00:34:42.230
let's go to the bathroom.

1494
00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:47.480
But now you know the women have stepped it up and they've gotten out of the out

1495
00:34:47.481 --> 00:34:48.760
of their comfort zone.

1496
00:34:49.150 --> 00:34:49.870
Damn.

1497
00:34:49.870 --> 00:34:50.301
They just,

1498
00:34:50.301 --> 00:34:51.440
they're just doing funny shit.

1499
00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:52.160
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

1500
00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:53.300
There's a lot of that for sure.

1501
00:34:53.301 --> 00:34:55.760
This is definitely the best time for women's comedy.

1502
00:34:55.970 --> 00:34:56.540
Yeah.

1503
00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:57.410
Best time for comedy.

1504
00:34:57.411 --> 00:34:58.244
I think I ever,

1505
00:34:58.250 --> 00:34:59.770
I don't people who've really see you,

1506
00:34:59.771 --> 00:35:02.060
you're your new shit that I saw you working on last night and I was like,

1507
00:35:02.061 --> 00:35:03.160
God damn it Joe.

1508
00:35:03.680 --> 00:35:05.600
I fucking hate you for being that brilliant.

1509
00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:06.250
Oh,

1510
00:35:06.250 --> 00:35:07.250
thank [inaudible] sweet.

1511
00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:08.530
Really good.

1512
00:35:08.530 --> 00:35:09.380
You guys don't know.

1513
00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:10.253
Thankfully you see it.

1514
00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:15.730
Well that crunch of putting out a CD or putting on a special and then the crunch

1515
00:35:16.131 --> 00:35:17.570
of coming up with a whole new hour.

1516
00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:18.560
That's the fun part.

1517
00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:19.760
It makes you be creative.

1518
00:35:19.761 --> 00:35:20.140
I mean,

1519
00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:21.080
you got to work.

1520
00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:21.381
You know,

1521
00:35:21.381 --> 00:35:22.550
I've been doing two sets of nine,

1522
00:35:22.551 --> 00:35:24.770
three sets a night out there hustling.

1523
00:35:24.950 --> 00:35:25.071
Yeah.

1524
00:35:25.071 --> 00:35:26.000
I did a Monday night.

1525
00:35:26.001 --> 00:35:26.840
I'm doing tonight.

1526
00:35:26.841 --> 00:35:27.880
I'm doing tomorrow night.

1527
00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:28.723
And it was just like,

1528
00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:29.421
if you,

1529
00:35:29.421 --> 00:35:29.800
uh,

1530
00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.970
if you just keep hammering at it like that,

1531
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:32.930
good things happen.

1532
00:35:32.931 --> 00:35:34.640
It's just we have got to pound it out.

1533
00:35:34.641 --> 00:35:34.911
You know?

1534
00:35:34.911 --> 00:35:36.440
He can't sound it out in your head.

1535
00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:36.990
No.

1536
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:37.320
You Go,

1537
00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:37.650
well,

1538
00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:37.980
you can

1539
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.380
<v 4>definitely get some bits that are almost ready,</v>

1540
00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:41.760
like right away from your head.

1541
00:35:41.790 --> 00:35:42.690
You just come up with them,

1542
00:35:42.691 --> 00:35:43.291
you write them down,

1543
00:35:43.291 --> 00:35:43.560
you're like,

1544
00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:43.741
oh,

1545
00:35:43.741 --> 00:35:43.951
this,

1546
00:35:43.951 --> 00:35:44.521
this will work,

1547
00:35:44.521 --> 00:35:44.990
you know?

1548
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.111
Yeah.

1549
00:35:45.111 --> 00:35:45.351
You know,

1550
00:35:45.351 --> 00:35:45.931
this will work.

1551
00:35:45.931 --> 00:35:48.210
So I'm gonna use that to wedge between these two things.

1552
00:35:48.211 --> 00:35:48.930
I'm trying to work.

1553
00:35:48.930 --> 00:35:49.860
Exactly.

1554
00:35:49.861 --> 00:35:50.311
Yeah.

1555
00:35:50.311 --> 00:35:50.640
Yeah.

1556
00:35:50.640 --> 00:35:51.421
I always do that.

1557
00:35:51.421 --> 00:35:51.661
I always,

1558
00:35:51.661 --> 00:35:52.080
I like,

1559
00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:54.840
some guys will go up with a completely like empty,

1560
00:35:55.140 --> 00:35:55.920
like sat,

1561
00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:58.410
like none of this stuff they've tried before,

1562
00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:02.250
but I almost always try new things out in between stuff that I know already

1563
00:36:02.251 --> 00:36:02.970
works.

1564
00:36:02.970 --> 00:36:03.690
You have to,

1565
00:36:03.690 --> 00:36:04.020
yeah.

1566
00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:04.201
I mean,

1567
00:36:04.201 --> 00:36:05.310
you're not up there to bomb.

1568
00:36:05.311 --> 00:36:06.090
That's,

1569
00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:06.451
that's,

1570
00:36:06.451 --> 00:36:06.661
you know,

1571
00:36:06.661 --> 00:36:07.290
that's not our,

1572
00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:08.370
that's not our fucking job.

1573
00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:09.360
It's a tricky,

1574
00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:12.270
tricky little tight little dancey do though.

1575
00:36:12.271 --> 00:36:12.570
Right.

1576
00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:14.400
It's like you definitely don't want to bomb,

1577
00:36:14.401 --> 00:36:17.250
but you don't want to continue to do the old stuff that you know works well.

1578
00:36:17.250 --> 00:36:19.140
I'm in the middle of a tour so I'm,

1579
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:20.333
you know,

1580
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:23.100
I'm at this point where I want to go onstage,

1581
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:26.250
but I don't want to cheat the audience in front of me and do the stuff that's

1582
00:36:26.251 --> 00:36:27.450
already in my act right now.

1583
00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:30.120
But at the same time I'm not thinking about new shit yet.

1584
00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:32.910
I am thinking about wanting to do new shit,

1585
00:36:32.911 --> 00:36:34.410
but I'm also not like,

1586
00:36:34.411 --> 00:36:34.950
you know,

1587
00:36:34.950 --> 00:36:38.210
I don't want to fuck my own two are up by going to on the spot bombing people

1588
00:36:38.211 --> 00:36:38.430
go,

1589
00:36:38.430 --> 00:36:39.261
why would I go see that too?

1590
00:36:39.261 --> 00:36:40.320
Or he was shit when I saw him.

1591
00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:40.471
Well,

1592
00:36:40.471 --> 00:36:44.190
you're doing these giant fucking theaters and then you're also doing clubs.

1593
00:36:44.250 --> 00:36:44.670
Yeah.

1594
00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:46.110
I think that's so important.

1595
00:36:46.111 --> 00:36:47.730
And we were talking about that last night too,

1596
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:50.310
that the intimacy of comedy clubs,

1597
00:36:50.311 --> 00:36:51.061
it's like you can't,

1598
00:36:51.061 --> 00:36:52.480
it can't get around.

1599
00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:54.680
It's the best environment for stand up.

1600
00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:54.901
Yeah.

1601
00:36:54.901 --> 00:36:57.450
It's like fucking prostitutes your whole life and then thinking you're making

1602
00:36:57.451 --> 00:36:58.284
love to a woman.

1603
00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:00.810
That's an interesting way of putting it.

1604
00:37:02.020 --> 00:37:05.010
Do you need a real woman to make love to this?

1605
00:37:05.011 --> 00:37:05.730
Is that what it is?

1606
00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:06.030
Yeah.

1607
00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:06.640
The comedy clubs.

1608
00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:07.320
A real woman.

1609
00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:07.680
Yeah.

1610
00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:09.210
Comedy clubs are overwhelming and if you're gay,

1611
00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:10.321
well you know,

1612
00:37:10.321 --> 00:37:11.190
then they're real man.

1613
00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:11.851
Whatever it is,

1614
00:37:11.851 --> 00:37:12.750
you're into a twink,

1615
00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:13.320
whatever,

1616
00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:14.250
whatever makes you happy.

1617
00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:15.601
They're not here to judge.

1618
00:37:15.601 --> 00:37:16.740
I'm just here to let you be happy.

1619
00:37:16.850 --> 00:37:17.220
Oh,

1620
00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:18.053
that's so sad.

1621
00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:18.961
Right?

1622
00:37:18.961 --> 00:37:20.160
Red Bands will be happy.

1623
00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:21.990
You playing with Tony last night,

1624
00:37:21.991 --> 00:37:22.381
by the way,

1625
00:37:22.381 --> 00:37:26.160
with some of the fun is when you called him out on the cable waste.

1626
00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:28.020
This was killed Tony,

1627
00:37:28.021 --> 00:37:28.800
the podcast,

1628
00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.900
and you guys did last night at the comedy store.

1629
00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:31.710
Yeah,

1630
00:37:31.710 --> 00:37:32.610
Russell was the gas.

1631
00:37:32.611 --> 00:37:33.930
It was a really fun episode.

1632
00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:38.130
Tony Tony was trying to do an impression of a gay guy and then went back to his

1633
00:37:38.131 --> 00:37:39.870
own voice and it was the exact same voice.

1634
00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:42.390
Tony was like,

1635
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:42.920
hey,

1636
00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:44.220
so it's not right,

1637
00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:44.701
and I'm like,

1638
00:37:44.701 --> 00:37:44.911
dude,

1639
00:37:44.911 --> 00:37:46.410
that's the same voice.

1640
00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:48.750
You're gave voices your regular voice.

1641
00:37:49.350 --> 00:37:50.183
It's so funny.

1642
00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:51.480
Poor Tony Hinchcliffe.

1643
00:37:52.110 --> 00:37:53.280
It's not easy being narrow.

1644
00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:57.030
He looks like one of those movies from the 60s.

1645
00:37:57.031 --> 00:37:58.730
Remember when everybody was long scanning?

1646
00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:00.171
Yeah.

1647
00:38:00.171 --> 00:38:01.110
Like Gene Kelly,

1648
00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:02.650
you know,

1649
00:38:02.650 --> 00:38:03.483
he,

1650
00:38:03.590 --> 00:38:04.321
he's got a pill.

1651
00:38:04.321 --> 00:38:05.970
He's the only guy who can slip between an elevator.

1652
00:38:05.971 --> 00:38:06.181
Right.

1653
00:38:06.181 --> 00:38:07.810
This is about the end.

1654
00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:10.800
Indiana Jones is grabbing his hat and,

1655
00:38:10.801 --> 00:38:12.300
and Tony could just fly through it too.

1656
00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:15.000
He's got a bit about,

1657
00:38:15.001 --> 00:38:15.150
uh,

1658
00:38:15.150 --> 00:38:18.530
someone giving them an insult and telling them that he looks like a guy with

1659
00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:19.470
sleeping hat on,

1660
00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:24.930
which is the perfect fucking like he could see one of those guys were like a

1661
00:38:24.931 --> 00:38:29.100
kabod crane type dudes from back when no one got any nutrients.

1662
00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:30.931
Yeah.

1663
00:38:30.931 --> 00:38:31.341
Back Day,

1664
00:38:31.341 --> 00:38:32.250
those fucking dudes,

1665
00:38:32.251 --> 00:38:33.210
they didn't get any food.

1666
00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:34.800
People were tiny shit,

1667
00:38:34.801 --> 00:38:35.110
man.

1668
00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:35.201
Know,

1669
00:38:35.201 --> 00:38:36.190
like the average person

1670
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:38.320
<v 2>during World War three or not world war three,</v>

1671
00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:38.800
uh,

1672
00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:42.370
during the civil war was like 120 535 pounds.

1673
00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:43.510
That was the average man.

1674
00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:45.630
We would have been fucking giant SPEC.

1675
00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:46.051
My God,

1676
00:38:46.051 --> 00:38:46.661
it was smashed.

1677
00:38:46.661 --> 00:38:48.490
Everybody would be ridiculous,

1678
00:38:48.491 --> 00:38:50.720
but could a humanity number heavyweight spec and the,

1679
00:38:50.721 --> 00:38:52.780
they were like 160 870 pounds.

1680
00:38:52.850 --> 00:38:55.990
I'm a rocky Marciano one 81 80 pounds,

1681
00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:57.580
180 make eight maybe.

1682
00:38:57.581 --> 00:38:59.320
And this prime at his heaviest,

1683
00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:00.191
you know,

1684
00:39:00.191 --> 00:39:00.851
and he was only five,

1685
00:39:00.851 --> 00:39:01.420
10.

1686
00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:02.740
That was the heavyweight champion of the world.

1687
00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:02.970
Yep.

1688
00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:03.910
Now we've got six,

1689
00:39:03.911 --> 00:39:05.890
six Vladimir Klitschko,

1690
00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:08.080
massive human super athlete.

1691
00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:09.390
That's why they're there.

1692
00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:11.380
That's why I'm even the Olympics have super heavyweight,

1693
00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:12.100
right.

1694
00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:13.450
They should have done in the UFC,

1695
00:39:13.750 --> 00:39:16.870
like Brock Lesnar's making a come back to the UFC and uh,

1696
00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:17.351
he's,

1697
00:39:17.351 --> 00:39:17.531
you know,

1698
00:39:17.531 --> 00:39:21.070
he's well over 300 pounds and he has to cut weight to get down to two 65.

1699
00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:23.110
Why does he have to be to 65 I don't know,

1700
00:39:23.111 --> 00:39:23.590
man.

1701
00:39:23.590 --> 00:39:23.741
Look,

1702
00:39:23.741 --> 00:39:25.420
I don't even know if he's really coming back to the UFC,

1703
00:39:25.421 --> 00:39:27.850
but that's what all the rumors are all over online.

1704
00:39:27.851 --> 00:39:30.520
They're talking about Brock losing weight to get to the UFC.

1705
00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:32.650
Don Frye was shitting on it the other day.

1706
00:39:32.950 --> 00:39:34.210
Don Probably shitting on block.

1707
00:39:34.211 --> 00:39:34.721
Brock Lesnar,

1708
00:39:34.721 --> 00:39:37.690
Brock Lesnar and cm punk and all that stuff.

1709
00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:38.021
I don't know.

1710
00:39:38.021 --> 00:39:39.250
He could shit on Brock Lesnar.

1711
00:39:39.251 --> 00:39:40.540
Brock Lesnar won the title.

1712
00:39:40.610 --> 00:39:41.950
You can be calling them a,

1713
00:39:42.030 --> 00:39:42.541
what'd you call him?

1714
00:39:42.541 --> 00:39:43.540
A little blond fairy.

1715
00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:45.130
Whoa.

1716
00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:49.060
He's fucking crazy.

1717
00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:49.691
Yeah.

1718
00:39:49.691 --> 00:39:51.670
I don't know if a Brock really is going to come back,

1719
00:39:51.671 --> 00:39:53.080
but if he does that'll be so exciting.

1720
00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:55.060
But I think they should have a super heavyweight.

1721
00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:56.103
They should don't shovel.

1722
00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:59.350
They just have a women's one 45 additional several women's.

1723
00:39:59.351 --> 00:39:59.690
Uh,

1724
00:39:59.690 --> 00:40:00.191
there's a,

1725
00:40:00.191 --> 00:40:00.610
um,

1726
00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:02.230
there's a mid weight between what?

1727
00:40:02.231 --> 00:40:07.231
W W what are the one 15 one 25 and then they have Bantam weight obviously.

1728
00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:09.730
So then they have two weight classes right now.

1729
00:40:10.690 --> 00:40:12.580
There needs to be something in between those two.

1730
00:40:12.581 --> 00:40:12.820
Yeah,

1731
00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:13.300
I agree.

1732
00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:14.980
I think it would at one 20 or something.

1733
00:40:15.010 --> 00:40:19.300
I think it'd be one 25 I don't think would be one 15 one 25 one 35 and hopefully

1734
00:40:19.301 --> 00:40:20.170
one 45.

1735
00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.740
They need to get Cyborg in the UFC before a prime is out.

1736
00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:24.670
You know,

1737
00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:26.940
she's still in her battery's dying.

1738
00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:27.730
Yeah.

1739
00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:28.980
Before it all ends.

1740
00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:30.910
He should also have an overweight class,

1741
00:40:30.911 --> 00:40:32.160
like the old days like that.

1742
00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:32.890
The big fat,

1743
00:40:32.890 --> 00:40:34.240
what does that big tank Abbott?

1744
00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:34.520
Yeah,

1745
00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:35.231
Tammy manual.

1746
00:40:35.231 --> 00:40:35.831
Yarborough.

1747
00:40:35.831 --> 00:40:38.720
And then just the big overweight or UFC,

1748
00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:40.240
he fought below to 65,

1749
00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:41.373
but I think um,

1750
00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:42.483
the uh,

1751
00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:46.630
a super heavyweight would be to 65 and above because it's kind of weird that you

1752
00:40:46.631 --> 00:40:48.790
have to lose weight for a heavyweight fight.

1753
00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:49.421
Did you don't,

1754
00:40:49.421 --> 00:40:49.571
yeah.

1755
00:40:49.571 --> 00:40:50.230
You think the whole,

1756
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:52.720
the whole purpose of being a heavyweight to so you don't have to lose wight.

1757
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:53.111
Yeah.

1758
00:40:53.111 --> 00:40:54.970
And this isn't the whole purpose of being a heavyweight is that you're the

1759
00:40:54.971 --> 00:40:56.050
biggest guy in the world.

1760
00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:56.691
Like you're,

1761
00:40:56.691 --> 00:40:57.281
you're the biggest,

1762
00:40:57.281 --> 00:40:58.210
strongest man.

1763
00:40:58.570 --> 00:40:59.170
Yeah.

1764
00:40:59.170 --> 00:41:03.880
So like I think it should be like two 65 and above that,

1765
00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:05.020
that's what makes sense to me.

1766
00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:06.160
A super heavyweight.

1767
00:41:06.610 --> 00:41:06.911
That'd be,

1768
00:41:06.911 --> 00:41:07.090
yeah,

1769
00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:08.110
that'd be good for Overeem.

1770
00:41:08.110 --> 00:41:09.670
Cause then they could decide where he wants to be.

1771
00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:10.930
He can't do that though.

1772
00:41:11.020 --> 00:41:14.350
He's the only way he's ever going to be able to fight that heavy as if he juices

1773
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:15.620
and set again.

1774
00:41:16.290 --> 00:41:18.520
Allegedly didn't they used to have that way class though?

1775
00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:19.870
Huge.

1776
00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:21.880
Then they never had that weight class.

1777
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:23.290
They just didn't have weight classes.

1778
00:41:24.070 --> 00:41:26.020
So when they started imposing weight classes,

1779
00:41:26.050 --> 00:41:31.030
there wasn't really enough talent at two 65 above two 65 for them to justify

1780
00:41:31.031 --> 00:41:33.890
having a super heavyweight cause you have like,

1781
00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:38.390
so let's say if you have a super heavyweight and you have some just giant Slob

1782
00:41:38.660 --> 00:41:40.610
who is like mediocre,

1783
00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:42.700
but he's big enough to fight it super heavy,

1784
00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:45.740
he becomes your champion and it's like that's not good.

1785
00:41:45.741 --> 00:41:47.450
Like you want to have like what's his name?

1786
00:41:47.451 --> 00:41:48.141
They're fucking,

1787
00:41:48.141 --> 00:41:50.030
I can picture him to want to just got knocked out.

1788
00:41:50.410 --> 00:41:52.190
Who has never been knocked up before?

1789
00:41:52.730 --> 00:41:56.360
Fat Heavyweight UFC guy.

1790
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:57.860
His name's not coming to mullet.

1791
00:41:58.730 --> 00:41:59.380
Mullet.

1792
00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:00.920
He Burger King fucking,

1793
00:42:00.921 --> 00:42:01.011
oh,

1794
00:42:01.011 --> 00:42:01.450
I'm talking.

1795
00:42:01.450 --> 00:42:02.510
Oh Roy Nelson.

1796
00:42:02.511 --> 00:42:03.530
Nelson Nelson.

1797
00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:04.341
Yeah,

1798
00:42:04.341 --> 00:42:04.611
Roy.

1799
00:42:04.611 --> 00:42:07.310
He really should be fighting at two oh five or you know,

1800
00:42:07.311 --> 00:42:07.620
he might,

1801
00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:09.230
I mean if he got really lean fuck,

1802
00:42:09.231 --> 00:42:12.620
he might even be able to make one 85 because he's weighing like,

1803
00:42:12.621 --> 00:42:13.040
you know,

1804
00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:15.920
two 50 to 60 and he's got that big giant gut.

1805
00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:16.300
Yeah.

1806
00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:19.160
If you just lost that gut and all that excess fat,

1807
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.521
I think,

1808
00:42:19.521 --> 00:42:21.020
I think he would get knocked out again.

1809
00:42:21.021 --> 00:42:22.460
Then a lot of using scented that.

1810
00:42:22.490 --> 00:42:22.960
Yeah.

1811
00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:25.340
Do you think he protects him being overweight?

1812
00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:26.060
I think it does.

1813
00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:27.740
And what keeps guys out a little bit.

1814
00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:28.191
It's hard.

1815
00:42:28.191 --> 00:42:28.491
It's hard.

1816
00:42:28.491 --> 00:42:28.641
You know,

1817
00:42:28.641 --> 00:42:29.474
it's hard to,

1818
00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:33.950
how do you shoot on a guy who's fucking gut is the first thing you're going to

1819
00:42:33.951 --> 00:42:34.520
hit?

1820
00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:35.840
It's probably a hard gut too.

1821
00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:36.171
Yeah,

1822
00:42:36.171 --> 00:42:37.004
it's a big man.

1823
00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:37.641
Yeah.

1824
00:42:37.641 --> 00:42:38.091
I don't know man.

1825
00:42:38.091 --> 00:42:38.924
He likes his food,

1826
00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:39.831
you know,

1827
00:42:39.831 --> 00:42:40.820
I'm not mad at him for it.

1828
00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:42.560
I was shocked when he got knocked out though.

1829
00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:47.330
I wasn't shocked because he was fighting hunt and the hunt is so slick.

1830
00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:48.470
He's so slick.

1831
00:42:48.890 --> 00:42:53.510
I mean he's been beaten by junior beat him and now we're doing beat him.

1832
00:42:53.511 --> 00:42:54.880
But when it comes skilled,

1833
00:42:54.881 --> 00:42:55.581
a skilled hunt,

1834
00:42:55.581 --> 00:42:56.001
first of all,

1835
00:42:56.001 --> 00:42:58.070
he's 40 years old and uh,

1836
00:42:58.071 --> 00:42:58.311
you know,

1837
00:42:58.311 --> 00:43:00.080
he's fought for decades.

1838
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:02.540
My heart Mark Hunt forever.

1839
00:43:02.541 --> 00:43:04.070
I remember him in pride and yeah,

1840
00:43:04.490 --> 00:43:05.660
so he's going to have some losses.

1841
00:43:05.661 --> 00:43:06.494
He's always going to,

1842
00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:08.060
some guys are going to beat him and you know,

1843
00:43:08.090 --> 00:43:10.040
we're doing beat him in a brilliant performance.

1844
00:43:10.041 --> 00:43:11.150
But when,

1845
00:43:11.240 --> 00:43:13.420
when he's on and smooth and you're striking with him,

1846
00:43:13.421 --> 00:43:14.540
but you can't keep that rhythm,

1847
00:43:14.541 --> 00:43:15.410
he'll fuck you up.

1848
00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:16.090
You know,

1849
00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:16.430
he,

1850
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:17.930
he did it to check Congo.

1851
00:43:19.070 --> 00:43:21.050
Congo had the chin of a fucking,

1852
00:43:21.450 --> 00:43:21.771
he could,

1853
00:43:21.771 --> 00:43:24.500
it was crystal had been its wars.

1854
00:43:24.890 --> 00:43:25.790
A lot of those guys,

1855
00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:26.001
you know,

1856
00:43:26.001 --> 00:43:30.120
by the time they get to the UFC or by the time they get to major,

1857
00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:30.530
uh,

1858
00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:32.240
that's like what happened with the cro cop.

1859
00:43:32.241 --> 00:43:32.900
You know,

1860
00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:33.733
you're right.

1861
00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:37.310
We're in a pride and he was so fucking dominant.

1862
00:43:37.330 --> 00:43:39.200
And then it wasn't the same guy.

1863
00:43:39.730 --> 00:43:42.920
It's fighting kickboxing or is he fighting MMA?

1864
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:45.020
I think he's fighting MMA on New Year's.

1865
00:43:45.021 --> 00:43:45.681
He's finding he,

1866
00:43:45.681 --> 00:43:46.220
she,

1867
00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:48.290
the Olympic gold medalist in judo.

1868
00:43:48.980 --> 00:43:49.271
Each,

1869
00:43:49.271 --> 00:43:50.104
she's had a few,

1870
00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:50.480
uh,

1871
00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:51.231
MMA fights.

1872
00:43:51.231 --> 00:43:54.680
He fought fade or got knocked out by fate or I want to fade ours last fights.

1873
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.650
The face.

1874
00:43:55.650 --> 00:43:58.730
Wasn't somebody trying to taunt fade or attempt fade or to come back?

1875
00:43:59.060 --> 00:43:59.391
Yeah,

1876
00:43:59.391 --> 00:44:00.890
the Bella tour,

1877
00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:01.960
which is the UFC,

1878
00:44:01.961 --> 00:44:02.794
he's um,

1879
00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:03.733
um,

1880
00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:05.180
like nemesis.

1881
00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:06.613
Well,

1882
00:44:07.070 --> 00:44:07.910
competition.

1883
00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:10.340
And they're there with Viacom,

1884
00:44:10.341 --> 00:44:10.521
you know,

1885
00:44:10.521 --> 00:44:10.881
so it's,

1886
00:44:10.881 --> 00:44:12.570
they have fucking billions dollars profit with them.

1887
00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:17.240
They might come up with some Russian oligarch type money if cause if they bought

1888
00:44:17.241 --> 00:44:17.570
out,

1889
00:44:17.570 --> 00:44:21.200
we're thinking if they bought out fader and then they outbid the UFC to get

1890
00:44:21.201 --> 00:44:22.034
Brock Lesnar,

1891
00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:26.490
Brock Lesnar versus fader and Bella tour federal would kill them.

1892
00:44:27.470 --> 00:44:28.040
You think so?

1893
00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:28.873
Yeah.

1894
00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:33.000
No matter how old fade or it's faders a fucking animal he prime.

1895
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:34.470
I would s I would agree with you,

1896
00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:36.630
but I think they're both out of their prime now.

1897
00:44:36.631 --> 00:44:37.560
Which would make what?

1898
00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:41.370
What would make it interesting and with experience behind them and all that,

1899
00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:41.760
you know,

1900
00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.110
most likely I agree with you.

1901
00:44:43.230 --> 00:44:45.810
The variables are Brock Lesnar.

1902
00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:48.840
How much has he been training in this time off?

1903
00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:51.420
How motivated is he to actually make come back?

1904
00:44:51.421 --> 00:44:54.150
Cause it's something that's been eating away at him or is this just a bunch of

1905
00:44:54.151 --> 00:44:55.050
bullshit rumors?

1906
00:44:55.230 --> 00:44:56.370
I mean I haven't talked to him.

1907
00:44:56.371 --> 00:44:57.330
I haven't talked to Dana.

1908
00:44:57.510 --> 00:44:59.220
All I'm doing is reading shit on the Internet.

1909
00:44:59.330 --> 00:44:59.521
Yeah.

1910
00:44:59.521 --> 00:45:02.280
I try not to talk to Dana about this kind of stuff unless it's in person,

1911
00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:02.931
you know.

1912
00:45:02.931 --> 00:45:04.170
So I'll find out this weekend.

1913
00:45:04.171 --> 00:45:07.590
And I didn't tell the new people shit just pulled me aside and whisper.

1914
00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:08.640
But if it is true,

1915
00:45:09.170 --> 00:45:09.600
um,

1916
00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:12.300
you got to wonder what is the motivation?

1917
00:45:12.301 --> 00:45:14.310
Like how much is he just thinking,

1918
00:45:14.311 --> 00:45:15.570
I don't want to wrestle anymore.

1919
00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:18.110
Or does he have this like this burning desire to try on and stick thing?

1920
00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:21.420
I think he doesn't have as much money as he thought he'd have right now.

1921
00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:22.350
You think?

1922
00:45:22.350 --> 00:45:22.831
And it's like,

1923
00:45:22.831 --> 00:45:23.280
you know what?

1924
00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:24.150
One more fight.

1925
00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:25.013
Nice paycheck.

1926
00:45:25.050 --> 00:45:25.980
I'll sit out after that.

1927
00:45:26.370 --> 00:45:27.000
Maybe.

1928
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.500
Why also no bills to pay.

1929
00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:29.040
You know,

1930
00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:31.500
he feels that that diverticulitis that he had,

1931
00:45:31.850 --> 00:45:33.930
whether he had 12 inches of his colon removed,

1932
00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:34.470
yeah.

1933
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:37.530
He feels that that was a huge limiting factor.

1934
00:45:37.531 --> 00:45:39.520
And they never fought 100% that,

1935
00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:40.681
I mean,

1936
00:45:40.681 --> 00:45:40.951
you know,

1937
00:45:40.951 --> 00:45:43.110
that's what you can eat seeds and,

1938
00:45:43.650 --> 00:45:44.431
and stuff like that.

1939
00:45:44.431 --> 00:45:44.791
That's what,

1940
00:45:44.791 --> 00:45:45.211
that's what it,

1941
00:45:45.211 --> 00:45:48.210
is that a diverticulitis and be when it's healing?

1942
00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:48.570
No.

1943
00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:49.530
That's what causes it.

1944
00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:50.491
That's what triggers it.

1945
00:45:50.491 --> 00:45:51.510
Sometimes seeds can do it,

1946
00:45:51.511 --> 00:45:51.721
right?

1947
00:45:51.721 --> 00:45:52.020
Yeah.

1948
00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:52.171
Yeah.

1949
00:45:52.171 --> 00:45:52.980
Cause it,

1950
00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:53.760
where's it stuck?

1951
00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:55.500
It gets stuck in eat and somehow,

1952
00:45:55.530 --> 00:45:55.890
you know,

1953
00:45:55.890 --> 00:45:56.850
perforates your uh,

1954
00:45:57.330 --> 00:45:58.320
your intestines and stuff.

1955
00:45:58.321 --> 00:46:00.870
Like there's apparently there's a bunch of causes for it.

1956
00:46:00.871 --> 00:46:04.160
The other ones are you can get developed abscesses if you eat too much protein

1957
00:46:04.161 --> 00:46:05.010
and not enough fiber.

1958
00:46:05.130 --> 00:46:05.550
That's true.

1959
00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:07.710
People get backed up and it sticks there.

1960
00:46:07.940 --> 00:46:09.180
And that's apparently Lesnar.

1961
00:46:09.570 --> 00:46:13.440
Couldn't you see Lesnar taking giant bites of meat and not even chewing them?

1962
00:46:16.150 --> 00:46:18.270
Just throwing them down like an alligator.

1963
00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:19.410
You know,

1964
00:46:19.410 --> 00:46:21.210
like if shit ever seen the allergist to show off,

1965
00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:23.700
take chunks of meat and just gobble it down.

1966
00:46:23.970 --> 00:46:24.803
Well that stuff gets,

1967
00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:26.640
you know what I want to try is that you've,

1968
00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:28.770
you've hunted wild pig.

1969
00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:29.551
Yeah.

1970
00:46:29.551 --> 00:46:31.770
I really want to taste some of that while I am.

1971
00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:32.930
I brought some in for him.

1972
00:46:33.420 --> 00:46:33.571
Yeah.

1973
00:46:33.571 --> 00:46:34.920
My Dad used to tell me about it,

1974
00:46:35.610 --> 00:46:36.240
smoke it,

1975
00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:37.110
put it on the smoker.

1976
00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:37.411
Oh,

1977
00:46:37.411 --> 00:46:38.130
so good.

1978
00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:40.980
My Dad used to eat wild boar in India and he was like,

1979
00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:41.521
Oh man,

1980
00:46:41.521 --> 00:46:42.330
that shit was,

1981
00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:42.601
he goes,

1982
00:46:42.601 --> 00:46:44.640
it's better than any pork you've ever eaten in your life.

1983
00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:45.690
What's a different color?

1984
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:46.260
It's weird.

1985
00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:46.730
Yeah,

1986
00:46:46.730 --> 00:46:47.850
but he says so delicious.

1987
00:46:47.851 --> 00:46:48.600
So tasty.

1988
00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:51.810
You get pig from the supermarket and it's like this pinkish.

1989
00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:51.991
I mean,

1990
00:46:51.991 --> 00:46:52.980
remember they were saying pork,

1991
00:46:52.981 --> 00:46:53.814
the other white meat.

1992
00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:55.980
Remember that and remember that it's not supposed to be white.

1993
00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:58.710
Like the pork that I have is now white at all.

1994
00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:01.740
Then when they're eating natural foods like acorns and stuff like that,

1995
00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:03.420
they developed this like dark skin.

1996
00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:04.501
That's like salmon.

1997
00:47:04.501 --> 00:47:06.660
When you buy salmon from the supermarket,

1998
00:47:07.290 --> 00:47:08.940
a lot of times if they don't die it,

1999
00:47:08.941 --> 00:47:09.780
it's Pale.

2000
00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:11.040
And so they,

2001
00:47:11.090 --> 00:47:14.430
they actually put dye in the flash to change to the code and we're going orange

2002
00:47:14.431 --> 00:47:14.910
too.

2003
00:47:14.910 --> 00:47:17.880
But that color that we're accustomed to is because of their diet.

2004
00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:19.440
It's because of the shrimp that they eat.

2005
00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:23.310
They eat the shrimp that makes their skin like an actual orange color,

2006
00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:27.090
and it's very similar to what happens with peacocks or not peacocks,

2007
00:47:27.091 --> 00:47:27.924
flamingos,

2008
00:47:28.050 --> 00:47:28.651
flamingos.

2009
00:47:28.651 --> 00:47:30.100
That pink color that flamingos

2010
00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:31.320
<v 7>have comes from the bugs.</v>

2011
00:47:31.370 --> 00:47:32.890
Eat not a trip.

2012
00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:34.113
I did not know this.

2013
00:47:34.900 --> 00:47:38.170
So when you see pork and the grocery store and it's that pale color,

2014
00:47:38.590 --> 00:47:40.690
that's some fucking prison pork,

2015
00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:42.081
that's important.

2016
00:47:42.081 --> 00:47:42.820
It's just like that,

2017
00:47:42.820 --> 00:47:43.061
that,

2018
00:47:43.061 --> 00:47:43.360
that,

2019
00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:44.050
that wasn't a,

2020
00:47:44.050 --> 00:47:45.370
that was shanked to death.

2021
00:47:45.450 --> 00:47:48.160
That did you see that video?

2022
00:47:48.161 --> 00:47:50.680
I put it on Twitter a few days ago of a,

2023
00:47:50.681 --> 00:47:55.540
this guy used a drone to fly over these pork factories and find out what kind of

2024
00:47:55.541 --> 00:47:57.730
a fucking holocaust camp they're running there.

2025
00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:58.300
Right?

2026
00:47:58.300 --> 00:47:59.133
Oh,

2027
00:47:59.410 --> 00:48:00.910
it's fuck dude.

2028
00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:01.991
It's fucked.

2029
00:48:01.991 --> 00:48:03.190
They have these lakes,

2030
00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:03.611
I mean,

2031
00:48:03.611 --> 00:48:06.550
just literally lakes of urine and shit.

2032
00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:10.540
Toxic Lake every underneath these pigs.

2033
00:48:10.541 --> 00:48:14.110
It's like these grates and they shit and piss and it goes into this funnel and

2034
00:48:14.111 --> 00:48:19.111
it flows into this like artificial lake that they've created of shit and piss

2035
00:48:20.050 --> 00:48:24.220
and it's like right next to these houses with these pigs live just jammed and

2036
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:25.090
next to each other.

2037
00:48:26.590 --> 00:48:28.390
I think I just quit eating pork.

2038
00:48:28.510 --> 00:48:29.530
I really do.

2039
00:48:29.590 --> 00:48:30.640
I think I quit eating pork.

2040
00:48:30.641 --> 00:48:31.474
Seen that.

2041
00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:33.010
I don't want to eat that.

2042
00:48:33.011 --> 00:48:34.120
I'm a fan of the pork.

2043
00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:35.830
It's delicious pork for me.

2044
00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:36.281
I need,

2045
00:48:36.281 --> 00:48:38.290
I think I need to go only wild pork.

2046
00:48:38.890 --> 00:48:40.030
They're smart man.

2047
00:48:40.330 --> 00:48:40.571
You know,

2048
00:48:40.571 --> 00:48:41.950
they're not dumb like cows.

2049
00:48:41.951 --> 00:48:42.340
No.

2050
00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:44.410
When you take pigs and stuff them in there like that,

2051
00:48:44.411 --> 00:48:45.540
like they're experiencing some,

2052
00:48:45.610 --> 00:48:48.730
some real torture ever.

2053
00:48:48.731 --> 00:48:51.100
See pigs being transported on the freeway.

2054
00:48:52.270 --> 00:48:53.870
It's depressing and they're passing like,

2055
00:48:53.890 --> 00:48:54.070
oh,

2056
00:48:54.070 --> 00:48:54.903
uh,

2057
00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:56.710
like they're passing Disneyland or something.

2058
00:48:56.711 --> 00:48:57.461
Do you think the pigs go,

2059
00:48:57.461 --> 00:48:57.641
hey,

2060
00:48:57.641 --> 00:48:57.881
fuck,

2061
00:48:57.881 --> 00:48:58.930
we're going to Disneyland guys.

2062
00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:02.800
If you believe in evolution and I know you don't,

2063
00:49:03.610 --> 00:49:04.443
I'm just kidding.

2064
00:49:05.530 --> 00:49:06.550
I'm a big proponent.

2065
00:49:06.551 --> 00:49:09.040
But if you believe in evolution and you think that,

2066
00:49:09.041 --> 00:49:09.650
I mean this,

2067
00:49:09.650 --> 00:49:10.483
it's just like,

2068
00:49:11.410 --> 00:49:12.243
you know,

2069
00:49:12.430 --> 00:49:13.270
not a real question.

2070
00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:14.080
Um,

2071
00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:15.430
but if you believe in evolution,

2072
00:49:15.431 --> 00:49:17.410
you think the things eventually,

2073
00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:18.310
like we,

2074
00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:19.390
at one point in time,

2075
00:49:19.391 --> 00:49:22.570
our ancient ancient ancestors were some sort of monkey,

2076
00:49:22.600 --> 00:49:23.170
right?

2077
00:49:23.170 --> 00:49:24.370
Or even before that,

2078
00:49:24.371 --> 00:49:25.450
some other mammal,

2079
00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:27.370
like I was listening to radio lab and they were,

2080
00:49:27.371 --> 00:49:27.771
they were,

2081
00:49:27.771 --> 00:49:27.910
uh,

2082
00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:29.590
talking about post,

2083
00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:30.573
uh,

2084
00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:32.500
post impact crater.

2085
00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:35.170
Like when the impact hit the Yucatan and killed all the dinosaurs.

2086
00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:36.940
Like what mammal survived.

2087
00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:40.240
That became that we became human beings eventually and it was like this weird

2088
00:49:40.241 --> 00:49:42.220
rodent thing and it was weird,

2089
00:49:42.250 --> 00:49:46.600
large burrowing rodent that managed to survive after the asteroid impact.

2090
00:49:47.290 --> 00:49:50.170
So that became a person who is on the Internet.

2091
00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:54.190
What if pigs get smart enough where they can start talking?

2092
00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:55.630
I mean with,

2093
00:49:55.630 --> 00:49:59.500
if we keep eating pigs for like the next couple thousand years and pigs just

2094
00:49:59.501 --> 00:50:03.280
slowly figured out only through mutation or selective breeding,

2095
00:50:03.520 --> 00:50:05.350
they're figuring out a way to manipulate their tongues.

2096
00:50:05.351 --> 00:50:07.630
The point where they can like express themselves.

2097
00:50:07.930 --> 00:50:08.111
Like,

2098
00:50:08.111 --> 00:50:08.351
please,

2099
00:50:08.351 --> 00:50:08.651
please,

2100
00:50:08.651 --> 00:50:09.550
please let me out of here.

2101
00:50:09.880 --> 00:50:10.990
I'll kill a chicken for you.

2102
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:12.130
I'll show you.

2103
00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:13.630
I'll show you where the cows sleeps.

2104
00:50:13.930 --> 00:50:14.051
Like,

2105
00:50:14.051 --> 00:50:14.830
come on man.

2106
00:50:14.830 --> 00:50:15.290
Don't,

2107
00:50:15.290 --> 00:50:15.640
don't,

2108
00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:15.900
don't,

2109
00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:16.210
don't,

2110
00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:17.043
don't do this.

2111
00:50:17.290 --> 00:50:17.861
Don't do this,

2112
00:50:17.861 --> 00:50:18.400
dude.

2113
00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:19.001
Don't do this.

2114
00:50:19.001 --> 00:50:19.460
So we're,

2115
00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:21.700
we need to wait for pigs to understand consequence.

2116
00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:22.340
Well,

2117
00:50:22.340 --> 00:50:25.540
we need to wait for pigs to express the fact that they don't want to be there.

2118
00:50:25.690 --> 00:50:25.901
Like,

2119
00:50:25.901 --> 00:50:27.040
we know the dolphins,

2120
00:50:27.110 --> 00:50:27.943
super smart,

2121
00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:28.070
but

2122
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:29.420
<v 2>we don't give a fuck if they complain,</v>

2123
00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:30.433
we don't know him.

2124
00:50:30.870 --> 00:50:31.130
Yeah,

2125
00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:31.281
yeah,

2126
00:50:31.281 --> 00:50:32.000
yeah.

2127
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.470
Do you want to fish oil?

2128
00:50:33.471 --> 00:50:34.304
You have to flip.

2129
00:50:34.510 --> 00:50:35.270
You know,

2130
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.421
like,

2131
00:50:35.421 --> 00:50:36.350
we know they're smart.

2132
00:50:36.370 --> 00:50:37.820
Like they're like people smart.

2133
00:50:38.090 --> 00:50:39.380
Like dolphins are stupid.

2134
00:50:39.381 --> 00:50:40.214
Smart.

2135
00:50:40.550 --> 00:50:42.560
We don't give a fuck and compassionate.

2136
00:50:42.890 --> 00:50:43.550
Yes.

2137
00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:45.050
And they've never killed a person.

2138
00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:47.540
Dolphins save people there.

2139
00:50:48.050 --> 00:50:51.110
There was one sort of rogue dolphin killed a person.

2140
00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:51.531
Yeah,

2141
00:50:51.531 --> 00:50:53.940
I remember reading about this either last year or something.

2142
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:56.270
I know killer whales have killed a bunch of that.

2143
00:50:56.271 --> 00:50:57.104
That's definite.

2144
00:50:57.140 --> 00:50:57.740
That's there.

2145
00:50:57.740 --> 00:50:58.573
It's in their name,

2146
00:50:58.610 --> 00:51:01.010
but there was like a rogue dolphin or so they killed someone.

2147
00:51:01.011 --> 00:51:01.340
Wow.

2148
00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:02.600
Dolphin kills people.

2149
00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:06.710
And the one with that pocket knife and then he was like on math or something.

2150
00:51:06.711 --> 00:51:07.544
Yeah.

2151
00:51:08.420 --> 00:51:10.280
The dark side of dolphins.

2152
00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:14.300
Dolphins attack humans.

2153
00:51:14.330 --> 00:51:14.510
Yeah.

2154
00:51:14.510 --> 00:51:15.343
They rape

2155
00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:18.560
dolphins or Brian red bands.

2156
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.891
Well,

2157
00:51:18.891 --> 00:51:20.690
this is the hard thing.

2158
00:51:20.691 --> 00:51:23.600
They re bill Cosby of don't kill each other's babies.

2159
00:51:23.601 --> 00:51:25.730
It's the most fucked up thing about dolphins.

2160
00:51:26.530 --> 00:51:26.710
Hey,

2161
00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:29.180
everybody's got a vice Joe doll.

2162
00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:31.010
Dolphins really are assholes.

2163
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:34.790
They're famous for killing a killing their own babies,

2164
00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:36.240
you know,

2165
00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:36.741
and not there.

2166
00:51:36.741 --> 00:51:37.640
It's what someone else's,

2167
00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.700
the dolphin became infamous for killing a swimmer.

2168
00:51:41.610 --> 00:51:42.443
<v 5>Wow.</v>

2169
00:51:43.470 --> 00:51:46.710
<v 2>30 people were attacked by this one.</v>

2170
00:51:46.711 --> 00:51:48.360
Dolphin kick.

2171
00:51:48.660 --> 00:51:49.171
Wow.

2172
00:51:49.171 --> 00:51:52.410
So this is like some like super aggressive dolphin.

2173
00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:54.660
His name is t I a.

2174
00:51:54.730 --> 00:51:56.370
O.

2175
00:51:56.370 --> 00:51:56.410
T.

2176
00:51:56.410 --> 00:51:57.780
I o was a female.

2177
00:51:57.810 --> 00:52:02.810
So for solitary female Bluenose dolphin that resided in a town in Brazil,

2178
00:52:05.130 --> 00:52:09.780
the dolphin became famous for killing a swimmer and injuring many others.

2179
00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:10.973
Wow.

2180
00:52:12.540 --> 00:52:13.470
Kill the swimmer.

2181
00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:14.520
I she kill swimmer.

2182
00:52:15.090 --> 00:52:16.170
Carberry held him down.

2183
00:52:17.850 --> 00:52:18.683
Came up,

2184
00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:19.583
snowed at him.

2185
00:52:21.150 --> 00:52:21.451
Oh,

2186
00:52:21.451 --> 00:52:21.721
she,

2187
00:52:21.721 --> 00:52:22.800
she killed a drunk,

2188
00:52:24.310 --> 00:52:24.601
you know,

2189
00:52:24.601 --> 00:52:26.490
they were harassing the Dolphin.

2190
00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:26.731
Oh,

2191
00:52:26.731 --> 00:52:26.821
well,

2192
00:52:26.821 --> 00:52:27.480
there you go.

2193
00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:29.190
There was two people that were,

2194
00:52:29.191 --> 00:52:30.540
hello harassment dolphin.

2195
00:52:30.541 --> 00:52:34.650
One guy's name was Wilson and the woman's name was Zhao and um,

2196
00:52:35.010 --> 00:52:37.860
they were harassing and possibly attempting to restrain the dolphin.

2197
00:52:37.861 --> 00:52:42.120
The Dolphin broke the ribs of Wilson and killed Zhao who was later found to be

2198
00:52:42.121 --> 00:52:44.130
drunk after this incident.

2199
00:52:44.131 --> 00:52:45.540
The dolphin briefly left,

2200
00:52:45.541 --> 00:52:46.590
but returned to the beach.

2201
00:52:46.591 --> 00:52:46.711
Well,

2202
00:52:46.711 --> 00:52:48.180
this is a wild dolphin too.

2203
00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:49.051
That's interesting,

2204
00:52:49.051 --> 00:52:49.884
man.

2205
00:52:49.980 --> 00:52:50.101
Well,

2206
00:52:50.101 --> 00:52:50.934
they were assholes.

2207
00:52:51.090 --> 00:52:53.910
They were assholes and they were fucking wrestling with this dolphin and don't

2208
00:52:53.911 --> 00:52:54.810
fuck with animals.

2209
00:52:55.410 --> 00:52:56.650
This drunk bitch died.

2210
00:52:56.980 --> 00:52:57.720
<v 6>That's what happened.</v>

2211
00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:00.150
I just bought a new book that I highly recommend about dolphins.

2212
00:53:00.151 --> 00:53:01.380
It's called wet goddess,

2213
00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:02.790
but it's available on Amazon.

2214
00:53:02.791 --> 00:53:06.720
It's about a relationship is the only person in the 50 shades of grey for

2215
00:53:06.721 --> 00:53:07.121
dolphins.

2216
00:53:07.121 --> 00:53:07.954
Yeah,

2217
00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:08.803
it really is.

2218
00:53:09.150 --> 00:53:10.050
Did you actually read it?

2219
00:53:10.100 --> 00:53:10.290
No,

2220
00:53:10.290 --> 00:53:10.831
I haven't read it yet.

2221
00:53:10.831 --> 00:53:12.120
I just got it just delivered today.

2222
00:53:12.121 --> 00:53:12.630
But it's,

2223
00:53:12.630 --> 00:53:13.200
it's uh,

2224
00:53:13.200 --> 00:53:14.033
here.

2225
00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:15.860
It's what got us,

2226
00:53:17.660 --> 00:53:18.493
but it's a,

2227
00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:18.781
yeah,

2228
00:53:18.781 --> 00:53:19.614
I bought two of them.

2229
00:53:21.390 --> 00:53:22.530
You can never have too many,

2230
00:53:22.590 --> 00:53:23.700
but I like the cover.

2231
00:53:23.701 --> 00:53:24.534
It's just like,

2232
00:53:24.570 --> 00:53:26.310
it's kind like a scrapbook with a adults.

2233
00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:27.770
Why did you buy two?

2234
00:53:28.860 --> 00:53:29.760
Why did you buy too?

2235
00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:31.270
I just feel like it's not going to be a for,

2236
00:53:31.410 --> 00:53:32.040
I don't know.

2237
00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:34.320
It's not going to be around for the way you're holding onto it.

2238
00:53:35.950 --> 00:53:38.130
You're going to be a hoarder from dolphin porn.

2239
00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:38.281
Well,

2240
00:53:38.281 --> 00:53:38.731
look at this.

2241
00:53:38.731 --> 00:53:39.830
I mean like they're used,

2242
00:53:39.831 --> 00:53:41.310
they're going for $61.

2243
00:53:43.520 --> 00:53:43.740
Yeah.

2244
00:53:43.740 --> 00:53:43.891
See,

2245
00:53:43.891 --> 00:53:44.701
I think there's a big mark.

2246
00:53:44.701 --> 00:53:45.031
Oh look,

2247
00:53:45.031 --> 00:53:47.730
this 1,900 wives.

2248
00:53:47.750 --> 00:53:48.330
Fuck.

2249
00:53:48.330 --> 00:53:48.781
How was that?

2250
00:53:48.781 --> 00:53:50.120
Is that probably not all paperback?

2251
00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:51.270
That's gotta be the hard copy.

2252
00:53:51.720 --> 00:53:53.700
That's to actually get the dolphin to fuck you.

2253
00:53:54.210 --> 00:53:56.360
A code code underground.

2254
00:53:56.370 --> 00:53:57.260
Fucking wrote about,

2255
00:53:58.120 --> 00:53:59.820
look at a spout on that dolphin.

2256
00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:01.470
You just buy the book and inside the book,

2257
00:54:01.471 --> 00:54:03.600
it's just directions to this place in San Diego.

2258
00:54:03.690 --> 00:54:05.960
That's one of the weird things about people when it comes to stuff like,

2259
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.720
like a dolphin

2260
00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:07.471
<v 7>porn or something like that.</v>

2261
00:54:07.471 --> 00:54:07.981
You would think,

2262
00:54:07.981 --> 00:54:08.340
well,

2263
00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:09.960
who the fuck would be into that?

2264
00:54:09.961 --> 00:54:12.480
And then you put it online and it attracts a whole community.

2265
00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:16.020
And the next thing you know is a message board all filled with people that are

2266
00:54:16.021 --> 00:54:20.820
talking about their dolphin porn and the Dolphin love and their kinship of you.

2267
00:54:20.821 --> 00:54:21.960
If you've heard about that.

2268
00:54:22.350 --> 00:54:23.041
Some people,

2269
00:54:23.041 --> 00:54:26.520
they don't want to be judged by being akin to certain animals.

2270
00:54:26.730 --> 00:54:28.290
They feel like their Fox kin,

2271
00:54:28.500 --> 00:54:30.480
like they feel connected to a Fox.

2272
00:54:31.730 --> 00:54:32.780
<v 3>I don't,</v>

2273
00:54:32.810 --> 00:54:33.190
I,

2274
00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:33.981
I can't,

2275
00:54:33.981 --> 00:54:34.814
uh,

2276
00:54:34.910 --> 00:54:36.920
I can sort of understand to a certain degree.

2277
00:54:36.921 --> 00:54:40.220
I did this movie a few years ago and I had to ride an elephant in it.

2278
00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:42.740
And when I was standing there with the elephant,

2279
00:54:42.741 --> 00:54:46.820
the way the elephant was looking at me and I was looking at her,

2280
00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:48.530
I really felt like,

2281
00:54:48.531 --> 00:54:49.340
I was like,

2282
00:54:49.340 --> 00:54:50.490
I really love you elephants.

2283
00:54:50.910 --> 00:54:52.970
Like I genuinely felt like,

2284
00:54:53.840 --> 00:54:55.730
I think I have a crush on this elephant.

2285
00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:57.110
Not in a sexual way.

2286
00:54:57.111 --> 00:54:57.561
More like,

2287
00:54:57.561 --> 00:54:58.940
I just want to hug you and love you.

2288
00:54:59.210 --> 00:54:59.391
<v 6>Yeah.</v>

2289
00:54:59.391 --> 00:55:01.890
Trainers have to fall in love with their animals a lot.

2290
00:55:01.891 --> 00:55:02.724
That's why I don't understand.

2291
00:55:02.740 --> 00:55:03.131
<v 3>Beat them.</v>

2292
00:55:03.131 --> 00:55:03.431
I'm like,

2293
00:55:03.431 --> 00:55:04.330
stop fucking hating him.

2294
00:55:04.331 --> 00:55:06.010
But that spiked fucking stick.

2295
00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:06.750
Yeah.

2296
00:55:06.750 --> 00:55:06.901
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

2297
00:55:06.901 --> 00:55:11.160
There are people that believe that they are akin like,

2298
00:55:11.250 --> 00:55:12.750
like they're somehow or another,

2299
00:55:12.751 --> 00:55:15.090
they should have been this animal instead of a person.

2300
00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:15.481
You know?

2301
00:55:15.481 --> 00:55:18.060
Some people think that they were born male,

2302
00:55:18.061 --> 00:55:19.080
but they really should have been a woman.

2303
00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:19.321
Yeah.

2304
00:55:19.321 --> 00:55:21.600
Some people think that they were born a person,

2305
00:55:21.601 --> 00:55:24.040
but they should have been an elephant or the shit that's,

2306
00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:24.421
that's a,

2307
00:55:24.421 --> 00:55:25.410
that's a little mental.

2308
00:55:25.830 --> 00:55:27.630
Is it though for you to judge?

2309
00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:29.640
I'm just saying people don't,

2310
00:55:30.180 --> 00:55:32.070
people don't understand there's a,

2311
00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:33.840
there's a whole tumbler blog about it.

2312
00:55:34.890 --> 00:55:35.723
Good Lord.

2313
00:55:37.690 --> 00:55:41.200
<v 3>Did they try to manifest physically into these things?</v>

2314
00:55:41.810 --> 00:55:42.590
<v 6>Uh,</v>

2315
00:55:42.590 --> 00:55:46.960
well some of those folks that are fluffy's are furries Hafiz.

2316
00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:49.873
Gabriel,

2317
00:55:51.410 --> 00:55:52.243
he's not

2318
00:55:53.250 --> 00:55:54.420
<v 7>laughing.</v>

2319
00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:55.141
Yeah.

2320
00:55:55.141 --> 00:55:55.921
Some of those people,

2321
00:55:55.921 --> 00:55:57.850
I'm sure that's what they're doing there.

2322
00:55:57.890 --> 00:56:00.240
They're wishing that they actually were some weird animal.

2323
00:56:01.170 --> 00:56:01.531
Yeah.

2324
00:56:01.531 --> 00:56:02.670
I think that's escapism.

2325
00:56:02.671 --> 00:56:03.504
What do you think?

2326
00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:07.710
I think a lot of what people do is escape is I'm including being into shit that

2327
00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:09.390
everybody just accepts,

2328
00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:11.400
like being in a dungeons and dragons.

2329
00:56:11.401 --> 00:56:13.880
That's escapism being into cosplay.

2330
00:56:13.890 --> 00:56:14.910
That's escapism.

2331
00:56:15.060 --> 00:56:17.310
Like at what point do we decide it's fucked up?

2332
00:56:17.311 --> 00:56:20.940
Like it's okay if you want to dress up and reenact the civil war.

2333
00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:22.740
Why is it fucked up?

2334
00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:24.130
If you want to pretend you're fox,

2335
00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:26.980
like you're not a soldier from 1800 you douchebag,

2336
00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:27.671
okay?

2337
00:56:27.671 --> 00:56:31.060
You're an asshole who wishes the south one and you're putting on some ancient

2338
00:56:31.061 --> 00:56:32.170
stuff and using a musket,

2339
00:56:32.410 --> 00:56:32.900
right?

2340
00:56:32.900 --> 00:56:33.940
That's what you're doing.

2341
00:56:34.290 --> 00:56:35.400
W you know why isn't it?

2342
00:56:35.470 --> 00:56:40.210
Why is that okay for you to pretend you were born Arrow with no internet for you

2343
00:56:40.211 --> 00:56:42.460
to pretend that you were born in the time where there's no cars.

2344
00:56:42.490 --> 00:56:43.323
That's okay,

2345
00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:45.070
but it's not okay to pretend you're a fox.

2346
00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:46.503
Hey,

2347
00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:47.733
see what I'm saying?

2348
00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:49.350
It's not okay to be a Fox.

2349
00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:53.700
You're live and let live love live and let die it yourself about

2350
00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:55.601
dat,

2351
00:56:55.601 --> 00:56:56.320
dat,

2352
00:56:56.320 --> 00:56:57.153
Dat,

2353
00:56:57.160 --> 00:56:57.401
Dat,

2354
00:56:57.401 --> 00:56:58.234
da Da.

2355
00:56:58.850 --> 00:57:01.430
<v 3>On the news today on the news today.</v>

2356
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:06.200
They found some hikers that went missing last night and the fucking idiot girl,

2357
00:57:06.650 --> 00:57:07.483
um,

2358
00:57:07.940 --> 00:57:11.180
did what they were like and she had no shoes on and then they're interviewing or

2359
00:57:11.181 --> 00:57:12.014
after and she's like,

2360
00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:16.990
well we can then we went to sleep last night and then I took my shoes off and

2361
00:57:16.991 --> 00:57:17.040
uh,

2362
00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:18.680
there was this box nearby and we're like,

2363
00:57:18.681 --> 00:57:19.580
what a cute Fox.

2364
00:57:19.581 --> 00:57:21.440
And I think the Fox stole my shoes.

2365
00:57:22.250 --> 00:57:22.730
Like,

2366
00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:23.900
you're in the fucking wilderness.

2367
00:57:23.901 --> 00:57:25.220
Keep your shoes on Asheville.

2368
00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:27.950
What are you trying to be respectful to the dirt that you're lying on?

2369
00:57:28.050 --> 00:57:29.520
<v 7>I've got some drama at my house,</v>

2370
00:57:29.521 --> 00:57:29.801
man.

2371
00:57:29.801 --> 00:57:30.580
When here hear some shit?

2372
00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:30.670
Oh,

2373
00:57:30.670 --> 00:57:30.811
I'm,

2374
00:57:30.811 --> 00:57:31.411
are you telling me this?

2375
00:57:31.411 --> 00:57:34.890
Last night a coyote ran off with one of my chickens.

2376
00:57:35.790 --> 00:57:36.623
I saw it.

2377
00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:37.231
I was,

2378
00:57:37.231 --> 00:57:37.830
this is what it's,

2379
00:57:37.830 --> 00:57:39.750
that's not even the most fucked up part of the story.

2380
00:57:40.410 --> 00:57:41.220
My Yard,

2381
00:57:41.220 --> 00:57:42.300
the way my yard is set up,

2382
00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:43.100
um,

2383
00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:47.880
well there's the back area and then there's this one acre,

2384
00:57:48.150 --> 00:57:49.440
like wooded lot.

2385
00:57:49.441 --> 00:57:54.441
It has trees is as huge place where my dogs hang out and they have the best

2386
00:57:54.631 --> 00:57:55.021
yard.

2387
00:57:55.021 --> 00:57:57.060
It's like this incredible yard's huge.

2388
00:57:57.230 --> 00:57:58.890
There was plenty of room for them to run around.

2389
00:57:59.190 --> 00:58:01.290
But the reality is,

2390
00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:03.600
you know when I'm at work or you know,

2391
00:58:03.601 --> 00:58:05.370
no one's home or you know,

2392
00:58:05.371 --> 00:58:05.940
maybe uh,

2393
00:58:05.940 --> 00:58:08.310
the dogs are inside because they want to be outside and playing.

2394
00:58:08.430 --> 00:58:12.420
They're by themselves for hours and hours at a time and I think they become

2395
00:58:12.421 --> 00:58:14.250
friends with a fucking coyote.

2396
00:58:14.670 --> 00:58:15.450
Sweet.

2397
00:58:15.450 --> 00:58:18.660
I think the coyote has weaseled his way into their friendship.

2398
00:58:19.030 --> 00:58:19.700
I think this,

2399
00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:20.460
cause this is,

2400
00:58:20.460 --> 00:58:25.460
my dogs are friendly dogs so I think what has happened is that coyote has gotten

2401
00:58:25.471 --> 00:58:26.430
close to them,

2402
00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:27.930
like stays in the outside of the fence.

2403
00:58:27.931 --> 00:58:30.870
They bark at him and he hangs out and he doesn't show any fear.

2404
00:58:31.110 --> 00:58:33.150
And then eventually Kim's closed and they like,

2405
00:58:33.350 --> 00:58:33.660
you know,

2406
00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:36.660
they like come close to each other and maybe he even goes in there and hangs out

2407
00:58:36.661 --> 00:58:37.140
with them.

2408
00:58:37.140 --> 00:58:39.520
I don't know cause coyotes can jump fences like crazy.

2409
00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:40.860
I've watched him do it.

2410
00:58:41.100 --> 00:58:42.030
It's amazing.

2411
00:58:42.150 --> 00:58:42.361
Like,

2412
00:58:42.361 --> 00:58:44.640
I watched him jump the fence with a chicken in his mouth and I was like,

2413
00:58:44.641 --> 00:58:45.600
Whoa,

2414
00:58:46.020 --> 00:58:46.950
these motherfuckers are,

2415
00:58:46.951 --> 00:58:48.420
they're just not like dog.

2416
00:58:48.421 --> 00:58:49.254
They're Wiley.

2417
00:58:49.290 --> 00:58:50.460
They're so smart.

2418
00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:51.413
So anyway,

2419
00:58:51.930 --> 00:58:52.500
um,

2420
00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:53.880
what I think happened,

2421
00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:54.870
here's,

2422
00:58:54.870 --> 00:58:55.703
so here's the story.

2423
00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:58.920
I see this fucking Fox or the coyote rather.

2424
00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:04.020
I see him running with the chicken in his mouth while I'm playing uno with my

2425
00:59:04.021 --> 00:59:04.620
daughters,

2426
00:59:04.620 --> 00:59:04.861
right?

2427
00:59:04.861 --> 00:59:06.820
We're playing cards and I'm looking out the window.

2428
00:59:06.821 --> 00:59:07.360
I'll go,

2429
00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:07.771
I'll fucking,

2430
00:59:07.771 --> 00:59:09.810
God is grabbing a chicken.

2431
00:59:10.350 --> 00:59:11.061
I run the dog.

2432
00:59:11.061 --> 00:59:11.191
Oh,

2433
00:59:11.191 --> 00:59:11.790
hey,

2434
00:59:11.790 --> 00:59:12.930
he doesn't give a fuck.

2435
00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:14.760
They don't got that chicken.

2436
00:59:14.761 --> 00:59:15.391
He's good.

2437
00:59:15.391 --> 00:59:16.920
And he's going to eat a whole chicken,

2438
00:59:17.070 --> 00:59:18.360
a full grown chicken.

2439
00:59:18.361 --> 00:59:19.081
He's psyched,

2440
00:59:19.081 --> 00:59:19.380
right?

2441
00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:21.000
That's a meal and a half or a coyote.

2442
00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:23.300
And he jumps over the fence and then I run out to get them.

2443
00:59:23.450 --> 00:59:24.950
And then I hear my wife scream,

2444
00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:28.100
the fucking dog is over here with a chicken in its mouth.

2445
00:59:28.101 --> 00:59:28.431
I'm like,

2446
00:59:28.431 --> 00:59:29.264
what?

2447
00:59:29.330 --> 00:59:34.280
The dog had gotten out of his side of the yard gun over to where the coyote was

2448
00:59:34.430 --> 00:59:35.990
and helped the coyote.

2449
00:59:36.190 --> 00:59:37.023
Oh,

2450
00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:39.020
he wasn't barking at the coyote.

2451
00:59:39.021 --> 00:59:39.711
He wasn't upset.

2452
00:59:39.711 --> 00:59:40.460
The coyote was there.

2453
00:59:40.460 --> 00:59:44.450
The coyote ran off of the chicken and Johnny had a chicken in his mouth.

2454
00:59:45.290 --> 00:59:45.891
John's a good guy.

2455
00:59:45.891 --> 00:59:46.550
You another one.

2456
00:59:46.550 --> 00:59:47.031
I could,

2457
00:59:47.031 --> 00:59:48.410
I couldn't fucking believe it.

2458
00:59:48.411 --> 00:59:48.651
I was like,

2459
00:59:48.651 --> 00:59:51.860
you've gotta be careful now because I'm coyotes are friending up your dog to uh,

2460
00:59:51.950 --> 00:59:52.550
to eat it.

2461
00:59:52.550 --> 00:59:52.870
Yeah.

2462
00:59:52.870 --> 00:59:53.060
Yeah.

2463
00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:53.211
Well,

2464
00:59:53.211 --> 00:59:54.044
he's huge.

2465
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:55.430
He's 140 pounds.

2466
00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:56.240
They're still going.

2467
00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:57.530
They're going to get a group of them together.

2468
00:59:57.531 --> 00:59:57.771
And I'm like,

2469
00:59:57.771 --> 00:59:58.251
listen guys,

2470
00:59:58.251 --> 00:59:59.630
I know we're going to have a feast.

2471
00:59:59.690 --> 00:59:59.970
That's,

2472
00:59:59.970 --> 01:00:01.010
I didn't take a lot of work.

2473
01:00:01.340 --> 01:00:02.960
You should get some trail cams going on.

2474
01:00:02.970 --> 01:00:03.590
And well,

2475
01:00:03.590 --> 01:00:04.070
dude,

2476
01:00:04.070 --> 01:00:05.480
death is uncommon.

2477
01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:06.433
It's going to happen.

2478
01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:08.690
There's going to be some destruction in my yard.

2479
01:00:08.930 --> 01:00:09.261
But,

2480
01:00:09.261 --> 01:00:09.570
uh,

2481
01:00:09.570 --> 01:00:10.130
the,

2482
01:00:10.130 --> 01:00:11.210
the point being like,

2483
01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:11.811
I,

2484
01:00:11.811 --> 01:00:13.550
it took me a while to figure out what happened.

2485
01:00:13.551 --> 01:00:14.870
I had to figure out how he got out.

2486
01:00:15.080 --> 01:00:19.730
And the way he got out was there's two fences and one fence has this latch that

2487
01:00:19.731 --> 01:00:20.564
was open.

2488
01:00:20.570 --> 01:00:21.740
Then he got to the second one.

2489
01:00:21.741 --> 01:00:24.650
The second one has this weird door where if you like wiggle it,

2490
01:00:24.680 --> 01:00:25.880
the latch pops up.

2491
01:00:26.030 --> 01:00:27.230
And he could just go through and he,

2492
01:00:27.240 --> 01:00:28.820
he knows how to do that and he's pretty smart.

2493
01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:29.990
So he wiggles that door.

2494
01:00:29.991 --> 01:00:31.580
He showed me how he got through and like,

2495
01:00:31.610 --> 01:00:32.780
oh you motherfucker.

2496
01:00:33.170 --> 01:00:37.670
And then I followed him and I'm not even mad at him because I just feel like he

2497
01:00:37.671 --> 01:00:38.504
just made a friend,

2498
01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:40.290
you know it's fucked up.

2499
01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:41.750
Could potentially having killed.

2500
01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:44.990
It's possible he just made friends with a gang member.

2501
01:00:46.790 --> 01:00:47.151
Yeah,

2502
01:00:47.151 --> 01:00:48.500
it is definitely possible.

2503
01:00:48.850 --> 01:00:51.110
If he was a small dog I'd be way more terrified.

2504
01:00:51.140 --> 01:00:52.670
No Daddy t-bones my friend,

2505
01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:54.650
he's an enormous dog.

2506
01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:55.790
But what is he?

2507
01:00:55.790 --> 01:00:57.110
He's a master for regency.

2508
01:00:57.111 --> 01:00:58.880
Massive half pit bull.

2509
01:00:58.881 --> 01:00:59.810
Half Neapolitan.

2510
01:00:59.811 --> 01:01:00.290
Massive.

2511
01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:02.570
They're big dogs but don't remember,

2512
01:01:02.571 --> 01:01:03.860
did I meet his a big sweetie?

2513
01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:04.581
He's a very,

2514
01:01:04.581 --> 01:01:05.414
very nice dog.

2515
01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:07.010
But he killed a chicken.

2516
01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:09.440
Can you step up your chicken chicken fence game?

2517
01:01:09.730 --> 01:01:10.401
Like it's going to be,

2518
01:01:10.401 --> 01:01:11.330
have to be more than that.

2519
01:01:11.530 --> 01:01:15.590
It doesn't matter cause coyotes can get over like ridiculous fences.

2520
01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:16.220
Like they,

2521
01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:17.300
they do weird shit.

2522
01:01:17.301 --> 01:01:20.720
Like first of all they figure out where there's high spots in the ground and

2523
01:01:20.721 --> 01:01:21.950
they bounced to the high spot.

2524
01:01:21.951 --> 01:01:24.140
And then over the fence I've watched him leave,

2525
01:01:24.141 --> 01:01:25.700
or like the park who are animals,

2526
01:01:25.930 --> 01:01:27.590
they really are the way he left.

2527
01:01:27.820 --> 01:01:28.220
Um,

2528
01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:31.160
there was a statue in my backyard and he leaped up,

2529
01:01:31.610 --> 01:01:34.610
put his feet on the statute and then over the fence and he did it like he's done

2530
01:01:34.611 --> 01:01:35.361
it a thousand times,

2531
01:01:35.361 --> 01:01:36.440
which you probably has.

2532
01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:39.800
So I realized that it's almost like a vampire sneaking out of your daughter's

2533
01:01:39.801 --> 01:01:41.120
window in the middle of the night.

2534
01:01:41.121 --> 01:01:41.390
You're like,

2535
01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:42.141
oh,

2536
01:01:42.141 --> 01:01:42.620
okay,

2537
01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:43.760
we got a problem here.

2538
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:47.000
Like this motherfucker has become friends with my dog.

2539
01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:50.140
You need to set up a trap and hunt that motherfucker.

2540
01:01:50.180 --> 01:01:50.360
Right?

2541
01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:50.481
Yeah.

2542
01:01:50.481 --> 01:01:55.070
We've got to figure out something to do because the dogs are at least in

2543
01:01:55.071 --> 01:01:57.560
somewhat danger because he will eat them.

2544
01:01:57.740 --> 01:01:57.981
I mean,

2545
01:01:57.981 --> 01:02:01.460
whether or not he thinks they're his friends or he cons them and thinking

2546
01:02:01.470 --> 01:02:02.150
they're his friends.

2547
01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:04.640
The coyote knows he's wild and he knows those are pets.

2548
01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:05.211
He,

2549
01:02:05.211 --> 01:02:09.380
it's probably just too much danger to try to attack the dog by himself.

2550
01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:13.040
You know when you have a big giant dog of the big head like that dog,

2551
01:02:13.041 --> 01:02:14.270
it's just too much power.

2552
01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:14.600
Now.

2553
01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:15.710
All of us to do is bite you.

2554
01:02:15.711 --> 01:02:18.500
It breaks your leg and your maimed and even if you get away,

2555
01:02:18.501 --> 01:02:20.100
you probably won't be able to catch anything and eat it.

2556
01:02:20.110 --> 01:02:20.943
You'll starve to death.

2557
01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:23.250
Dogs and coyotes are totally different animals.

2558
01:02:23.250 --> 01:02:26.930
Coyotes are acutely aware of the danger involved in any altercations,

2559
01:02:26.931 --> 01:02:28.200
so they're very Wiley.

2560
01:02:28.350 --> 01:02:30.390
They very sneaky and how they set things up,

2561
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:33.120
but I'm almost positive that this dog and my coyote,

2562
01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:34.820
the coyote,

2563
01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:35.281
coyote,

2564
01:02:35.281 --> 01:02:36.180
and my dog are friends,

2565
01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:37.890
which is really fucked.

2566
01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:39.240
Are you allowed to hunt coyote?

2567
01:02:39.420 --> 01:02:40.253
Is that legal?

2568
01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:41.520
I do not know.

2569
01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:42.480
I don't know if you can hunt them,

2570
01:02:42.481 --> 01:02:43.830
but can you just kill one,

2571
01:02:43.831 --> 01:02:44.360
right?

2572
01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:44.790
Yeah,

2573
01:02:44.790 --> 01:02:45.700
I think what?

2574
01:02:45.710 --> 01:02:45.860
Well,

2575
01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:46.111
okay,

2576
01:02:46.111 --> 01:02:46.681
look around.

2577
01:02:46.681 --> 01:02:47.160
Is it a little bit,

2578
01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:50.370
let's say one of the laws for killing coyotes in California,

2579
01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:52.890
not do you have a silencer?

2580
01:02:54.210 --> 01:02:59.210
We can't talk about this on the Internet and by silence or I mean somebody who

2581
01:02:59.641 --> 01:03:03.390
just tells you to be quick think I'm probably going to do is hire someone to

2582
01:03:03.391 --> 01:03:05.770
deal with it because uh,

2583
01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:07.453
the road runner,

2584
01:03:07.850 --> 01:03:10.140
this is probably like organizations that,

2585
01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:11.573
that do it,

2586
01:03:11.940 --> 01:03:12.773
you know,

2587
01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:14.540
I guess hire a couple of doors,

2588
01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:15.433
pizza on the couch.

2589
01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:18.390
Well they have problems with that all the time with pets.

2590
01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:21.600
Like they have coyotes that come into neighborhoods and start killing a ton of

2591
01:03:21.601 --> 01:03:22.434
pants.

2592
01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:23.520
Like we were talking about this,

2593
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:26.970
there was a retirement community in this retirement community.

2594
01:03:27.150 --> 01:03:29.430
They had some ungodly numbers in Arizona.

2595
01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:34.560
There was like 30 attacks one year on pets by coyotes where people were walking

2596
01:03:35.641 --> 01:03:36.270
the pets.

2597
01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:38.400
They realize that these people were old and they,

2598
01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:42.260
they can't walk so good and they just like free lunch and they just run up to

2599
01:03:42.261 --> 01:03:43.094
him and steal their dog.

2600
01:03:43.290 --> 01:03:43.690
It's,

2601
01:03:43.690 --> 01:03:47.550
it's also scary just the fact that there is a coyote in your yard and if your

2602
01:03:47.551 --> 01:03:51.510
daughter's outside playing and there's this crazy coyote with rabies and shit,

2603
01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:53.490
well they will not even rabies.

2604
01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:55.920
They just see something small and they're in if they're really hot.

2605
01:03:55.950 --> 01:03:57.840
Well my daughter's never by themselves.

2606
01:03:57.990 --> 01:03:58.710
Totally.

2607
01:03:58.710 --> 01:04:00.480
But you gotta be careful.

2608
01:04:00.510 --> 01:04:03.480
There was a five year old kid that was attacked in big bear just last year.

2609
01:04:03.810 --> 01:04:04.643
His fucking,

2610
01:04:04.770 --> 01:04:06.000
his dad had a poll,

2611
01:04:06.001 --> 01:04:07.140
the coyote off of them.

2612
01:04:07.160 --> 01:04:08.640
The coyote had bit the kid's leg.

2613
01:04:08.641 --> 01:04:10.590
It was trying to take them down five-year-old.

2614
01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:11.760
Yeah.

2615
01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:13.800
Fuck that dude.

2616
01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:14.370
Yeah.

2617
01:04:14.370 --> 01:04:16.490
I sit there and pretty bad in Burbank also,

2618
01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:17.850
but I have such a high fence.

2619
01:04:17.851 --> 01:04:18.650
I don't even think there's a,

2620
01:04:18.650 --> 01:04:19.341
<v 3>I hear,</v>

2621
01:04:19.341 --> 01:04:24.341
I hear them and there's a huge pack of in my near my house and one night I was

2622
01:04:24.831 --> 01:04:26.720
standing on the balcony at night and I could hear them,

2623
01:04:27.090 --> 01:04:27.251
you know,

2624
01:04:27.251 --> 01:04:28.610
making all their fucking noise.

2625
01:04:28.611 --> 01:04:33.200
And then I heard a dog barking and here are from then I here and then

2626
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:34.141
<v 7>silence.</v>

2627
01:04:34.141 --> 01:04:35.520
It was just quiet.

2628
01:04:36.270 --> 01:04:37.590
Dead ass quiet.

2629
01:04:38.430 --> 01:04:38.880
Yeah,

2630
01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:39.330
I dunno.

2631
01:04:39.330 --> 01:04:40.770
We'd have to figure out what the laws are.

2632
01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:43.170
That'd be real care if my neighbor has horses.

2633
01:04:43.550 --> 01:04:44.383
Ooh.

2634
01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:46.980
So I don't think they're going to mess with the horse.

2635
01:04:46.981 --> 01:04:47.814
So much.

2636
01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:49.130
Horses too big.

2637
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:51.780
All they'd have to do is get kicked by that horse.

2638
01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:52.993
The horse will kill him.

2639
01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:53.281
Yeah.

2640
01:04:53.281 --> 01:04:55.770
I had a dog get his foot broken by a horse.

2641
01:04:56.460 --> 01:05:00.570
He was just too curious and the horse wants stomp to stomp down on his foot.

2642
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:02.670
Your thought about getting a horse,

2643
01:05:02.671 --> 01:05:03.180
Joe?

2644
01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:03.691
No,

2645
01:05:03.691 --> 01:05:04.740
I'm not into horses.

2646
01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:05.910
Pony for the babies.

2647
01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:06.873
I would like to,

2648
01:05:06.930 --> 01:05:07.920
I mean I like horses,

2649
01:05:07.921 --> 01:05:09.180
like to look at and pet them,

2650
01:05:09.181 --> 01:05:12.180
but I'm not in a riding animals at all and I'm like,

2651
01:05:12.210 --> 01:05:13.110
we have cars.

2652
01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:14.093
This is stupid.

2653
01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:14.670
I'm just like,

2654
01:05:14.670 --> 01:05:17.010
I'm not into this relationship or my,

2655
01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:19.000
rub it on your back and your carry me over.

2656
01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:23.170
I rode a horse once when I was like 13 and I remember how much my balls hurt and

2657
01:05:23.171 --> 01:05:24.190
they were brand new then.

2658
01:05:24.490 --> 01:05:25.323
Your balls

2659
01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:28.650
did not tell balls.

2660
01:05:28.660 --> 01:05:29.560
They are today.

2661
01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:33.280
The beatings that they've taken now they can hang on you on either side of the

2662
01:05:33.281 --> 01:05:34.360
pony or a horse.

2663
01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:35.261
Okay,

2664
01:05:35.261 --> 01:05:35.801
so there's a,

2665
01:05:35.801 --> 01:05:40.630
there's an article on coyote removal in suburban areas.

2666
01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:41.320
Hmm.

2667
01:05:41.320 --> 01:05:42.153
Interesting.

2668
01:05:43.180 --> 01:05:44.710
Coyote removal and suburban areas.

2669
01:05:44.711 --> 01:05:48.220
Once coyotes have lost their fear of humans or have started behaving

2670
01:05:48.221 --> 01:05:49.660
aggressively at health and safety.

2671
01:05:49.661 --> 01:05:50.441
Hazard exists.

2672
01:05:50.441 --> 01:05:54.580
Usually it can be remedied only by the removal of one or two or more,

2673
01:05:54.581 --> 01:05:55.660
one or more of the coyotes.

2674
01:05:55.661 --> 01:05:59.560
Typical typically coyote removal in urban or suburban areas conducted by

2675
01:05:59.561 --> 01:06:00.460
Predator control.

2676
01:06:00.461 --> 01:06:04.120
Professionals who shoot coyotes are captured them and padded leghold traps or

2677
01:06:04.121 --> 01:06:04.810
snares.

2678
01:06:04.810 --> 01:06:06.730
So I've got to hire somebody captured.

2679
01:06:06.731 --> 01:06:11.350
Coyotes must be destroyed as relocating problem coyotes would incur unacceptable

2680
01:06:11.351 --> 01:06:14.230
liability and risk on the part of the agency involved.

2681
01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:18.520
And relocation is illegal without prior approval of the California Department of

2682
01:06:18.521 --> 01:06:18.941
fish and game.

2683
01:06:18.941 --> 01:06:19.810
So you have to kill them.

2684
01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:21.820
No problem with that.

2685
01:06:22.290 --> 01:06:22.670
Fuck,

2686
01:06:22.670 --> 01:06:23.290
I wonder what the,

2687
01:06:23.290 --> 01:06:24.670
what is the law though?

2688
01:06:25.070 --> 01:06:26.530
I hope nobody from pitas listening.

2689
01:06:26.650 --> 01:06:27.483
I don't think,

2690
01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:28.660
well listen man,

2691
01:06:28.661 --> 01:06:29.670
if they are pita,

2692
01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:31.840
you kill a lot of fucking cats and dogs every year.

2693
01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:35.590
Can you eat coyotes kid get the truth and you can't eat them.

2694
01:06:35.591 --> 01:06:38.060
They are gross and they most likely have diseases.

2695
01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:39.310
You have to cook the shit out of it.

2696
01:06:39.311 --> 01:06:41.500
But Steve Nela cooked and ate a coyote.

2697
01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:42.850
Could pull that video up.

2698
01:06:42.851 --> 01:06:43.684
It's pretty fucked up.

2699
01:06:43.930 --> 01:06:44.770
Steve Rinella.

2700
01:06:44.980 --> 01:06:45.580
How did,

2701
01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:46.600
how did he say coyote?

2702
01:06:47.190 --> 01:06:47.411
Uh,

2703
01:06:47.411 --> 01:06:49.000
he said it was like diver duck,

2704
01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:50.320
which doesn't really help me.

2705
01:06:50.530 --> 01:06:51.363
That is know me either.

2706
01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:53.453
Yeah.

2707
01:06:53.620 --> 01:06:55.270
Gamie is the only one we understand.

2708
01:06:56.830 --> 01:06:57.663
Yeah.

2709
01:06:58.150 --> 01:06:58.930
Gamie is,

2710
01:06:58.930 --> 01:06:59.200
uh,

2711
01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:01.360
usually it's just the way they treat it.

2712
01:07:01.770 --> 01:07:02.260
It's like,

2713
01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:03.160
or the way they,

2714
01:07:03.161 --> 01:07:03.340
uh,

2715
01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:03.761
rather,

2716
01:07:03.761 --> 01:07:04.594
um,

2717
01:07:04.650 --> 01:07:05.040
uh,

2718
01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:08.290
process the meat from killing it to actually eating it is like a,

2719
01:07:08.291 --> 01:07:13.291
it allows to it to get spoiled or warm or the tarsal gland from the animal.

2720
01:07:13.331 --> 01:07:15.280
It can get like certain animals,

2721
01:07:15.281 --> 01:07:16.180
especially when they're in heat.

2722
01:07:16.210 --> 01:07:18.050
Like a lot of times if you get deer,

2723
01:07:18.940 --> 01:07:20.410
you're getting deer in there.

2724
01:07:20.411 --> 01:07:20.621
Yeah.

2725
01:07:20.621 --> 01:07:21.454
This is a coyote.

2726
01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:22.660
They're burning it on the,

2727
01:07:22.661 --> 01:07:23.494
uh,

2728
01:07:23.590 --> 01:07:24.423
the fire.

2729
01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:25.300
You can,

2730
01:07:25.300 --> 01:07:27.280
they won't pull us from Youtube.

2731
01:07:27.310 --> 01:07:28.031
You could play this.

2732
01:07:28.031 --> 01:07:28.864
Okay.

2733
01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:30.040
It's already on youtube.

2734
01:07:30.041 --> 01:07:30.490
No.

2735
01:07:30.490 --> 01:07:30.761
Yeah,

2736
01:07:30.761 --> 01:07:33.310
but we get pulled from youtube all the time for shit.

2737
01:07:33.311 --> 01:07:34.950
But this would only be a,

2738
01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:35.813
yeah.

2739
01:07:36.200 --> 01:07:37.033
<v 8>Vexing question.</v>

2740
01:07:38.290 --> 01:07:39.790
That's a coyote cow.

2741
01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:43.900
Our coyote is as perfectly cooked as it's ever going to get.

2742
01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:46.250
All that's left to do is to dig.

2743
01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:47.740
That's real nice.

2744
01:07:48.670 --> 01:07:49.503
All right.

2745
01:07:49.790 --> 01:07:50.980
It doesn't look bad.

2746
01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:52.420
Well,

2747
01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:53.253
let's meet,

2748
01:07:53.410 --> 01:07:53.861
you know what I mean?

2749
01:07:53.861 --> 01:07:54.940
It's well seasoned.

2750
01:07:56.110 --> 01:07:59.410
I just got the taste of what a coyote smells like.

2751
01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:03.210
It's fatty.

2752
01:08:03.210 --> 01:08:04.570
I mean it's like dry fatty.

2753
01:08:04.571 --> 01:08:05.404
I Dunno.

2754
01:08:06.090 --> 01:08:06.923
I like that.

2755
01:08:07.180 --> 01:08:07.351
Yeah,

2756
01:08:07.351 --> 01:08:08.071
like it's rich.

2757
01:08:08.071 --> 01:08:09.400
Like dry Turkey lane,

2758
01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:13.720
whereas like dry but still got that dark meat.

2759
01:08:15.130 --> 01:08:16.220
Three iot.

2760
01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:17.073
<v 7>This is so weird.</v>

2761
01:08:18.350 --> 01:08:23.350
I'll tell you one day you made sloppy joes or this or you could make a pulled

2762
01:08:23.931 --> 01:08:25.520
pork with this with barbecue sauce.

2763
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:27.230
You would never ever,

2764
01:08:27.231 --> 01:08:27.501
ever.

2765
01:08:27.501 --> 01:08:27.890
No.

2766
01:08:27.890 --> 01:08:28.723
Wow,

2767
01:08:30.230 --> 01:08:30.710
that's great.

2768
01:08:30.710 --> 01:08:32.720
I think everything tastes better with barbecue sauce.

2769
01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:34.220
Oh God.

2770
01:08:34.580 --> 01:08:39.580
There's a website called pita kills animals and Peta has killed more than 33

2771
01:08:39.951 --> 01:08:44.951
animals since (990) 830-3030 3033 is not really a high number.

2772
01:08:46.161 --> 01:08:46.490
Yeah,

2773
01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:46.880
sorry.

2774
01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:51.880
33,000 animals since 1998 these are dogs at p to euthanize and discarded in a

2775
01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:55.730
North Carolina dumpster.

2776
01:08:56.270 --> 01:08:57.103
Whoa.

2777
01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:58.280
How was that?

2778
01:08:58.280 --> 01:08:58.940
Oh my God.

2779
01:08:58.940 --> 01:08:59.960
There's the photographs.

2780
01:09:00.630 --> 01:09:01.370
Yes.

2781
01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:01.551
Oh,

2782
01:09:01.551 --> 01:09:02.570
this is so fucked.

2783
01:09:04.850 --> 01:09:05.091
Yeah.

2784
01:09:05.091 --> 01:09:05.351
Why?

2785
01:09:05.351 --> 01:09:10.130
I think there's like they run out of resources like they don't know.

2786
01:09:10.131 --> 01:09:10.790
Um,

2787
01:09:10.790 --> 01:09:12.920
well there's a report about how many,

2788
01:09:13.820 --> 01:09:18.740
the vast pita swiftly kills the vast majority of the dogs and cats and it's

2789
01:09:18.741 --> 01:09:19.574
care.

2790
01:09:20.270 --> 01:09:20.930
Wow.

2791
01:09:20.930 --> 01:09:21.081
Yeah.

2792
01:09:21.081 --> 01:09:23.630
It seems like you could just put a couple a motion detector,

2793
01:09:23.631 --> 01:09:28.631
trail cams then run out and like get your bow and just shoot it in the detector

2794
01:09:30.321 --> 01:09:31.130
goes off.

2795
01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:31.431
Yeah.

2796
01:09:31.431 --> 01:09:33.570
But you gotta be careful about the legality of it,

2797
01:09:34.230 --> 01:09:38.900
of like shooting a weapon in an urban or suburban area.

2798
01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:39.921
That's what their fear is.

2799
01:09:39.921 --> 01:09:41.210
That you'll miss the shoot a human.

2800
01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:41.421
Yeah.

2801
01:09:41.421 --> 01:09:42.254
Well you are you,

2802
01:09:42.830 --> 01:09:43.221
yeah,

2803
01:09:43.221 --> 01:09:46.040
you could definitely hit something else if you miss,

2804
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:47.090
you're not supposed to do that.

2805
01:09:47.130 --> 01:09:48.110
You've got to get a trap.

2806
01:09:48.230 --> 01:09:49.190
I'm just going to hire somebody.

2807
01:09:49.191 --> 01:09:54.020
I want to fucking go out Indiana Jones on this coyote Rambo side in the tree.

2808
01:09:55.100 --> 01:10:00.100
Plus I don't want to get fucking invested in this thing and that weird way.

2809
01:10:00.860 --> 01:10:04.640
There's gotta be some sort of coyote removal service that's an expert,

2810
01:10:04.641 --> 01:10:07.460
but an electrical fence with a light mild current to that.

2811
01:10:07.461 --> 01:10:09.940
Cause I have kids and I have chickens and I have,

2812
01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:12.020
there's all sorts of stuff going on.

2813
01:10:12.140 --> 01:10:14.960
Have you been there for the chickens and the chickens freaking out like they're

2814
01:10:14.961 --> 01:10:15.710
not happy.

2815
01:10:15.710 --> 01:10:20.060
There's two of them are dead cow and the other ones have to be far freaked

2816
01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:24.110
because they saw it happen probably and now my dog is fucking public enemy

2817
01:10:24.111 --> 01:10:24.944
number one.

2818
01:10:25.390 --> 01:10:26.930
And then my wife was super mad at him too.

2819
01:10:26.931 --> 01:10:27.950
She loves the chickens.

2820
01:10:29.210 --> 01:10:30.043
Get your eggs from him.

2821
01:10:30.170 --> 01:10:32.390
It's just weird that he didn't even bark at the coyote.

2822
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:34.460
He just ran over there and was hanging out with him.

2823
01:10:34.970 --> 01:10:35.803
That's his buddy.

2824
01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:36.890
What's like a wolf?

2825
01:10:36.890 --> 01:10:37.670
Right?

2826
01:10:37.670 --> 01:10:38.660
They're just smarter shit.

2827
01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:39.710
Who Was it last night?

2828
01:10:39.711 --> 01:10:40.341
Was it rent as easy?

2829
01:10:40.341 --> 01:10:44.630
That was telling us the story of the coyote had a fake limp.

2830
01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:47.030
Like these coyotes were walking in front of this,

2831
01:10:47.450 --> 01:10:50.270
this area with a fake limp and a nose.

2832
01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:51.140
The Sklar brothers,

2833
01:10:51.410 --> 01:10:55.040
Sklar brothers Coyote is walking in front of his dog with a fake limp and the

2834
01:10:55.041 --> 01:10:56.480
dogs barking and running up to the fence,

2835
01:10:56.481 --> 01:10:57.560
Blah Blah.

2836
01:10:57.890 --> 01:11:00.410
And the guy goes out to grab his dog to stop it,

2837
01:11:00.411 --> 01:11:03.440
sees the coyote there and looks down at the end of the driveway and there's

2838
01:11:03.530 --> 01:11:05.180
eight other coyotes waiting.

2839
01:11:05.570 --> 01:11:09.590
So with this coyote was going to do Beetham like pretend it's limping.

2840
01:11:09.620 --> 01:11:11.030
Like they walk like they're limping.

2841
01:11:11.150 --> 01:11:12.680
The dog comes out to chase them.

2842
01:11:12.770 --> 01:11:14.250
They were down on the other [inaudible]

2843
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:15.143
<v 2>Gang Bang them.</v>

2844
01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:16.141
Fuck.

2845
01:11:16.141 --> 01:11:17.040
That's what I'm saying.

2846
01:11:17.070 --> 01:11:18.420
That's why I'm worried for your dog.

2847
01:11:18.720 --> 01:11:19.553
It's possible.

2848
01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:20.820
But he seems to be buddies with him.

2849
01:11:20.821 --> 01:11:22.260
Like he's not trying to kill anybody.

2850
01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:24.020
He's trying to show him chickens are,

2851
01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:25.320
it's kind of how they friend them,

2852
01:11:25.321 --> 01:11:25.830
you know.

2853
01:11:25.830 --> 01:11:26.520
I'm sure.

2854
01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:26.761
Look,

2855
01:11:26.761 --> 01:11:27.451
if they could,

2856
01:11:27.451 --> 01:11:28.260
they would eat them.

2857
01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:29.093
But like I said,

2858
01:11:29.250 --> 01:11:30.083
he,

2859
01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:30.850
I have another dog.

2860
01:11:30.850 --> 01:11:31.120
They'll,

2861
01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.010
they'll kill for sure.

2862
01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:32.791
He's small.

2863
01:11:32.791 --> 01:11:35.430
He's only like 40 pounds or 50 at the most.

2864
01:11:35.431 --> 01:11:36.091
How big is Brutus?

2865
01:11:36.091 --> 01:11:36.421
You think?

2866
01:11:36.421 --> 01:11:36.861
50 pounds.

2867
01:11:36.861 --> 01:11:37.620
80 pounds.

2868
01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:38.640
And he's not big at all like that.

2869
01:11:38.641 --> 01:11:39.420
His name's Brutus.

2870
01:11:39.420 --> 01:11:39.810
Yeah,

2871
01:11:39.810 --> 01:11:40.051
he's,

2872
01:11:40.051 --> 01:11:41.220
his name is Mr Booboo.

2873
01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:42.113
That's what I call,

2874
01:11:42.330 --> 01:11:44.100
she's still limping or is he off fix,

2875
01:11:44.101 --> 01:11:45.000
get well,

2876
01:11:45.001 --> 01:11:46.110
he's got arthritis.

2877
01:11:46.680 --> 01:11:47.101
Those,

2878
01:11:47.101 --> 01:11:47.301
uh,

2879
01:11:47.301 --> 01:11:51.810
a lot of those weird breeds like a English bulldogs with those crazy phases.

2880
01:11:52.170 --> 01:11:52.831
Those dogs,

2881
01:11:52.831 --> 01:11:53.131
man,

2882
01:11:53.131 --> 01:11:56.100
they breathed the shit out of him and they breed them to the point with like a

2883
01:11:56.101 --> 01:11:58.770
good majority of them have health issues.

2884
01:11:59.130 --> 01:12:01.830
Like a lot of them have problems with their noses.

2885
01:12:01.831 --> 01:12:01.951
They,

2886
01:12:01.951 --> 01:12:03.450
a lot of them have problems breathing.

2887
01:12:03.690 --> 01:12:05.880
A lot of them have problems with their hips.

2888
01:12:05.910 --> 01:12:09.690
They have like arthritis issues and he's half Sheebu he knew.

2889
01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:12.520
So he's probably better off than some of them are cause he's got a little less

2890
01:12:12.530 --> 01:12:13.291
Shiba ina with them,

2891
01:12:13.291 --> 01:12:16.500
which is like a sort of a pretty agile little dog.

2892
01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:18.240
But you know,

2893
01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:19.133
poor little guy.

2894
01:12:19.320 --> 01:12:21.000
But he just laid around all day and chills.

2895
01:12:21.150 --> 01:12:21.983
Just sweet dog.

2896
01:12:22.290 --> 01:12:23.340
They'll fuck him up though.

2897
01:12:23.670 --> 01:12:25.350
That's a different that he can't even kill a chicken.

2898
01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:25.860
The chicken.

2899
01:12:25.860 --> 01:12:27.300
Fuck him Johnny Cash

2900
01:12:29.430 --> 01:12:30.600
shitting in the little in June.

2901
01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:31.220
Well,

2902
01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:32.670
I used to have a dog named Frank Sinatra.

2903
01:12:33.210 --> 01:12:35.310
I had another dog named squeaky Fromme

2904
01:12:36.990 --> 01:12:37.823
and uh,

2905
01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:38.851
this is,

2906
01:12:38.851 --> 01:12:39.380
uh,

2907
01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:41.280
he's Johnny Cash to my favorite though.

2908
01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:42.173
He's the best.

2909
01:12:42.330 --> 01:12:43.163
He's so sweet.

2910
01:12:43.170 --> 01:12:43.830
How old is he?

2911
01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:44.880
He's a eight.

2912
01:12:45.230 --> 01:12:48.210
It's like it's getting up there for a big dog for sure.

2913
01:12:48.211 --> 01:12:49.780
They don't start getting kidney problems.

2914
01:12:49.781 --> 01:12:50.220
No.

2915
01:12:50.220 --> 01:12:51.390
Do you have any hip or knee?

2916
01:12:51.810 --> 01:12:53.070
He's got a little bit of arthritis,

2917
01:12:53.071 --> 01:12:55.860
but you put fish oil in his diet and it helps that up quite a bit.

2918
01:12:56.250 --> 01:12:58.560
Officialism amazing anti-inflammatory man.

2919
01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:00.120
He put that in their diet.

2920
01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:02.370
Keep them away from grain based diets.

2921
01:13:02.371 --> 01:13:02.581
That's,

2922
01:13:02.581 --> 01:13:03.420
that's big too.

2923
01:13:03.570 --> 01:13:04.403
Like a lot of those,

2924
01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:06.090
a lot of those dog foods that you buy,

2925
01:13:06.091 --> 01:13:06.601
they're cheap.

2926
01:13:06.601 --> 01:13:09.840
They have a lot of filler in them that fucks with dogs that have arthritis.

2927
01:13:10.410 --> 01:13:10.591
You know,

2928
01:13:10.591 --> 01:13:13.020
people are very similar in a lot of ways.

2929
01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:17.220
Like there's certain foods that cause inflammation in people and same thing with

2930
01:13:17.221 --> 01:13:17.640
dogs.

2931
01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:18.810
But I find that fish oil,

2932
01:13:18.811 --> 01:13:19.501
it makes a difference.

2933
01:13:19.501 --> 01:13:21.450
I give them fish oil squeak,

2934
01:13:21.720 --> 01:13:25.860
get it from the grocery store or the pet food store and you squirt it on their

2935
01:13:25.861 --> 01:13:26.300
food.

2936
01:13:26.300 --> 01:13:26.610
Yeah.

2937
01:13:26.610 --> 01:13:27.330
You got dogs?

2938
01:13:27.330 --> 01:13:27.601
No,

2939
01:13:27.601 --> 01:13:28.370
I have no pets.

2940
01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:28.590
No,

2941
01:13:28.590 --> 01:13:29.101
that's nice.

2942
01:13:29.101 --> 01:13:30.390
You could have fucking crazy parties.

2943
01:13:30.391 --> 01:13:31.320
You don't have to worry about anybody getting,

2944
01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:32.173
have a daughter.

2945
01:13:32.650 --> 01:13:33.360
That's it.

2946
01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:34.260
She has a cat.

2947
01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:34.710
She,

2948
01:13:34.710 --> 01:13:36.600
her and my ex wife have a little cat.

2949
01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:37.813
Oh,

2950
01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:39.340
I just got a new kitten.

2951
01:13:40.130 --> 01:13:41.790
I actually really like Kay.

2952
01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:45.090
Well I got it for my daughter cause you know my daughter broke her arm.

2953
01:13:45.330 --> 01:13:46.163
Which one?

2954
01:13:46.410 --> 01:13:47.100
Which daughter?

2955
01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:49.870
The six year old and she broke her arm and um,

2956
01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:52.410
she was a at school and doing the monkey bars,

2957
01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:54.840
which is how I broke my arm in the exact same age.

2958
01:13:55.410 --> 01:13:56.090
And uh,

2959
01:13:56.090 --> 01:13:56.790
she's a little girl.

2960
01:13:56.790 --> 01:14:00.540
She was so sad and she you to wear a cast and we said when you get your cast off

2961
01:14:00.541 --> 01:14:01.130
we'll get your kit.

2962
01:14:01.130 --> 01:14:04.080
And she gave her like this thing to look forward to.

2963
01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:07.050
Did you get to get particular breed or just another rag doll?

2964
01:14:07.530 --> 01:14:10.350
I love those rag dolls there for like a house cat.

2965
01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:11.213
They're the best.

2966
01:14:11.230 --> 01:14:12.160
They're so sweet.

2967
01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:13.211
<v 7>Like you pick them up,</v>

2968
01:14:13.211 --> 01:14:13.991
they just start purring.

2969
01:14:13.991 --> 01:14:14.920
They go limp on you.

2970
01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:17.140
They're just like always want to be around.

2971
01:14:17.141 --> 01:14:17.570
Yeah.

2972
01:14:17.570 --> 01:14:19.190
<v 4>My daughter's cat purr,</v>

2973
01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:20.420
like loves my daughter,

2974
01:14:20.430 --> 01:14:22.370
like just follows around everywhere she goes.

2975
01:14:22.371 --> 01:14:23.870
When you see any picture of my daughter sleeping,

2976
01:14:23.871 --> 01:14:25.760
the cat's right beside her at all times.

2977
01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:29.330
One Paul on her just to make sure she doesn't go anywhere.

2978
01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:30.880
<v 7>It's pretty cool.</v>

2979
01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:31.900
That's adorable.

2980
01:14:32.260 --> 01:14:33.160
That's adorable.

2981
01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:37.360
But then will bite her at all times because my daughter will just fuck with it.

2982
01:14:37.630 --> 01:14:37.901
Yeah.

2983
01:14:37.901 --> 01:14:40.540
My cat scratch the shit out of my four year old this morning.

2984
01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:41.410
Yeah.

2985
01:14:41.410 --> 01:14:42.300
She was a pig.

2986
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:45.250
Well they pick her up like she's a stuffed animal and the four year old doesn't

2987
01:14:45.251 --> 01:14:45.880
get it.

2988
01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:46.960
The six year old gets it.

2989
01:14:46.961 --> 01:14:48.860
But the four year old like things like this is fucking,

2990
01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:50.110
I'll do whatever I want with you.

2991
01:14:51.110 --> 01:14:53.040
<v 4>You can put this little nubbies on their claws.</v>

2992
01:14:53.150 --> 01:14:53.450
Yeah.

2993
01:14:53.450 --> 01:14:54.410
They have like these little rubber.

2994
01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:55.111
<v 7>Yeah,</v>

2995
01:14:55.111 --> 01:14:57.510
I have that on spazz on the old cat.

2996
01:14:58.140 --> 01:14:58.530
She's,

2997
01:14:58.530 --> 01:14:59.940
she doesn't have much time left man.

2998
01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:02.940
My oldest cat is 18 she's almost 19 Jesus,

2999
01:15:02.980 --> 01:15:05.010
she'll be 19 in like a few months.

3000
01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:06.120
She can go drink in Canada.

3001
01:15:07.830 --> 01:15:12.000
Is that 18 that you drank 10 and 19 Canada's so much better in that way.

3002
01:15:12.030 --> 01:15:12.930
That's so smart.

3003
01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:15.750
You're going to pretend kids aren't gonna drink at 18 I could be done.

3004
01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:17.970
<v 4>It is a very ridiculously,</v>

3005
01:15:18.210 --> 01:15:19.030

3006
01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:20.280
that governed law,

3007
01:15:20.310 --> 01:15:21.240
that one in America,

3008
01:15:21.241 --> 01:15:22.530
that 21 year old drinking age.

3009
01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:24.810
I think it really puzzles the shit out of me.

3010
01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:29.380
<v 7>I would rather have 18 year old drinkers and 21 year old drivers.</v>

3011
01:15:30.490 --> 01:15:31.323
Uh Yeah.

3012
01:15:31.330 --> 01:15:33.370
Or 21 year old gun owners and 18 year olds.

3013
01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:34.130
Yeah.

3014
01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:35.380
I would really like,

3015
01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:41.020
I'm way more concerned with you being an idiot driving a car than I am with you

3016
01:15:41.021 --> 01:15:41.651
being an idiot.

3017
01:15:41.651 --> 01:15:43.270
Just driving or just drinking.

3018
01:15:43.271 --> 01:15:43.780
Right.

3019
01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:46.180
So if you're getting like 18 year old kids,

3020
01:15:46.570 --> 01:15:47.890
a lot of them have to have jobs obviously.

3021
01:15:47.891 --> 01:15:48.490
So this is,

3022
01:15:48.490 --> 01:15:49.323
you know,

3023
01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:50.980
it fucks them up if they need to drive.

3024
01:15:51.340 --> 01:15:56.340
But I think that I'm more concerned with them driving a fucking car at 16 and

3025
01:15:57.161 --> 01:16:00.310
drinking illegally than I am with them.

3026
01:16:00.610 --> 01:16:00.971
You know,

3027
01:16:00.971 --> 01:16:03.240
just just being able to drink at eight

3028
01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:05.410
<v 4>16 year old girl on the highway,</v>

3029
01:16:05.411 --> 01:16:06.244
texting,

3030
01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:06.980
driving,

3031
01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:07.813
watch this

3032
01:16:08.050 --> 01:16:09.340
<v 7>senior old boy the other day,</v>

3033
01:16:09.341 --> 01:16:12.850
weaving in and out of lanes and I thought it was hammered and I got next to him

3034
01:16:12.851 --> 01:16:16.000
and looked at his car and he's just sitting there like this while he's driving,

3035
01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:16.840
texting,

3036
01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:17.710
trying to get some pussy.

3037
01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:18.813
It's late at night,

3038
01:16:18.970 --> 01:16:19.803
you know,

3039
01:16:19.810 --> 01:16:22.540
trying to Texas girlfriend just sneak out the window trying to meet her in the

3040
01:16:22.541 --> 01:16:23.340
fucking,

3041
01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:25.990
meet her in the swing set and swing set.

3042
01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:27.580
Meet you at the monkey bars.

3043
01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:28.913
Break up.

3044
01:16:29.260 --> 01:16:29.501
I mean,

3045
01:16:29.501 --> 01:16:33.370
how many parents are just fucking take an ambiance at night to go to sleep and a

3046
01:16:33.371 --> 01:16:38.371
kid's just sneaking out getting Dick or given it I've given Dick or get an end

3047
01:16:39.401 --> 01:16:40.234
given dick.

3048
01:16:40.540 --> 01:16:41.150
Yeah,

3049
01:16:41.150 --> 01:16:44.330
<v 4>I was lucky I was allowed to sleep over at my girlfriend's house at a different</v>

3050
01:16:44.331 --> 01:16:48.340
school district at the age of 1615 and her dad would come in and he's like,

3051
01:16:48.550 --> 01:16:48.800
yeah,

3052
01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:50.090
her dad would come and wake us up.

3053
01:16:50.091 --> 01:16:51.140
It'd be like a burden.

3054
01:16:51.141 --> 01:16:53.360
You've got to wake up cause I have to wake up earlier.

3055
01:16:53.450 --> 01:16:54.650
You were being bed together?

3056
01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:54.830
Yeah.

3057
01:16:54.830 --> 01:16:55.960
It would be laying in bed together.

3058
01:16:56.180 --> 01:16:57.013
Your mouth.

3059
01:16:57.050 --> 01:16:57.440
Yeah.

3060
01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:58.070
It was weird.

3061
01:16:58.070 --> 01:16:58.730
It was really weird.

3062
01:16:58.730 --> 01:16:59.010
Oh,

3063
01:16:59.010 --> 01:16:59.920
Maria fucking too.

3064
01:17:00.650 --> 01:17:00.891
Oh yeah,

3065
01:17:00.891 --> 01:17:01.461
we were fucking,

3066
01:17:01.461 --> 01:17:03.860
she's the one that had my first threesome with that girl.

3067
01:17:04.940 --> 01:17:08.720
I think the whole family was just very freaky for his liberal and then there's

3068
01:17:08.721 --> 01:17:10.250
just eh,

3069
01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:11.020
<v 2>fuck it.</v>

3070
01:17:11.020 --> 01:17:11.300
Yeah,

3071
01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:11.860
but he,

3072
01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:12.693
that dad,

3073
01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:13.250
the guy,

3074
01:17:13.250 --> 01:17:14.570
the dad that would wake us up.

3075
01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:17.300
He's one of the richest guys in the United States.

3076
01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:17.931
Is He really?

3077
01:17:17.931 --> 01:17:18.764
Yeah.

3078
01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:19.820
Warren Buffett's kid.

3079
01:17:21.290 --> 01:17:21.800
Good deal.

3080
01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:22.280
What happened?

3081
01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:22.531
How'd you,

3082
01:17:22.531 --> 01:17:23.420
how'd you fucked that up?

3083
01:17:24.570 --> 01:17:25.310
I don't remember.

3084
01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:25.551
Oh,

3085
01:17:25.551 --> 01:17:27.140
after the threesome it fucked everything up.

3086
01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:28.130
Oh ways.

3087
01:17:28.130 --> 01:17:28.341
Yeah.

3088
01:17:28.341 --> 01:17:29.390
Whenever I hear about that,

3089
01:17:29.610 --> 01:17:31.220
I hear you're going to have a threesome with two chicks.

3090
01:17:31.221 --> 01:17:32.020
You don't really know.

3091
01:17:32.020 --> 01:17:32.660
Yeah.

3092
01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:33.493
Now you're talking.

3093
01:17:33.590 --> 01:17:35.640
A friend of mine said that to me.

3094
01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:39.380
It can't be emotional for us going to let them have threesomes and I said I had

3095
01:17:39.381 --> 01:17:42.680
a joke about it that like having a friend come up to you and tell you that he's

3096
01:17:42.681 --> 01:17:46.280
about to have threesomes is like having a friend come up to you and tell you

3097
01:17:46.430 --> 01:17:49.500
that he's starting to make his own bombs like,

3098
01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:49.791
oh,

3099
01:17:49.791 --> 01:17:51.080
that's going to blow up in your face.

3100
01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:53.160
Yeah.

3101
01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:53.840
You can't have,

3102
01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:55.280
even if your girl is trying to be cool,

3103
01:17:55.281 --> 01:17:55.700
hey,

3104
01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:57.260
why don't we think about bringing,

3105
01:17:57.261 --> 01:17:57.710
nope,

3106
01:17:57.710 --> 01:17:58.910
let's not think about that.

3107
01:17:59.540 --> 01:18:03.530
Leave that to the fucking whores that want to do that or the professionals.

3108
01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:04.330
Yeah,

3109
01:18:04.330 --> 01:18:05.163
four hands.

3110
01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:07.860
It's the emotions involved there.

3111
01:18:07.960 --> 01:18:08.751
They can't handle it.

3112
01:18:08.751 --> 01:18:09.720
That meant it's,

3113
01:18:09.730 --> 01:18:10.970
it sounds good on paper to them.

3114
01:18:11.300 --> 01:18:16.100
I have a friend that was dating a girl while they were dating in the beginning.

3115
01:18:16.130 --> 01:18:17.150
They weren't very serious.

3116
01:18:17.410 --> 01:18:22.190
Had a threesome together with his friend and then kept dating and then

3117
01:18:22.191 --> 01:18:25.140
eventually got married and got closer and closer and like,

3118
01:18:25.810 --> 01:18:26.150
you know,

3119
01:18:26.150 --> 01:18:28.730
like became like a serious item and I go,

3120
01:18:28.731 --> 01:18:31.430
how do you get over the fact that your friend was fucking her mouth while you

3121
01:18:31.431 --> 01:18:32.540
were banging it from behind?

3122
01:18:32.541 --> 01:18:33.590
Like this is what you guys did.

3123
01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:35.083
And he goes,

3124
01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:37.033
I just,

3125
01:18:37.370 --> 01:18:38.203
I just,

3126
01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:39.440
it just is,

3127
01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:39.860
it is.

3128
01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:41.390
I mean he was laughing what he was talking about.

3129
01:18:41.610 --> 01:18:42.680
He had a racist term.

3130
01:18:42.681 --> 01:18:43.850
Your head just is,

3131
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:45.980
it's as good friend.

3132
01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:49.190
But I mean the friend was over the house and I was,

3133
01:18:49.191 --> 01:18:50.510
I watched the interaction,

3134
01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:50.991
you know,

3135
01:18:50.991 --> 01:18:51.621
like the friend,

3136
01:18:51.621 --> 01:18:53.510
like I was over and uh,

3137
01:18:53.540 --> 01:18:53.811
you know,

3138
01:18:53.811 --> 01:18:57.440
he's there with his wife and a friend came over and she hugs the friend and he

3139
01:18:57.441 --> 01:18:58.161
hugs the friend.

3140
01:18:58.161 --> 01:18:58.461
I'm like,

3141
01:18:58.461 --> 01:18:59.181
Yo,

3142
01:18:59.181 --> 01:19:01.430
Ho Ho and a bottle of rum.

3143
01:19:02.150 --> 01:19:02.511
Hey Man,

3144
01:19:02.511 --> 01:19:03.230
you know,

3145
01:19:03.230 --> 01:19:03.861
memories.

3146
01:19:03.861 --> 01:19:04.694
I guess they weren't,

3147
01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:06.290
I guess time heals,

3148
01:19:06.920 --> 01:19:07.610
but is it a pain?

3149
01:19:07.610 --> 01:19:08.443
Well,

3150
01:19:08.450 --> 01:19:08.901
how long,

3151
01:19:08.901 --> 01:19:10.100
what was the time difference?

3152
01:19:10.101 --> 01:19:11.230
I mean years and years.

3153
01:19:11.490 --> 01:19:12.323
That's enough time.

3154
01:19:12.410 --> 01:19:13.190
Eight or nine years.

3155
01:19:13.190 --> 01:19:14.750
But time you get over it,

3156
01:19:14.900 --> 01:19:15.770
but it's not just the,

3157
01:19:15.771 --> 01:19:17.480
it's like time heals.

3158
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:18.410
If there's a wound,

3159
01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:20.420
there's a wound for you.

3160
01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:21.890
But is there a wound for him?

3161
01:19:22.090 --> 01:19:22.940
Like that's the question.

3162
01:19:23.010 --> 01:19:25.310
He's got that smirk the whole time.

3163
01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:26.383
Maybe,

3164
01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:26.840
you know,

3165
01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:27.290
he doesn't,

3166
01:19:27.290 --> 01:19:28.130
maybe it doesn't care.

3167
01:19:28.820 --> 01:19:30.950
Maybe neither one of them earlier that attached to it.

3168
01:19:31.110 --> 01:19:33.770
Well maybe it's one of those things like when people become swingers,

3169
01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:34.280
you know,

3170
01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:36.590
which is way more common than you would think.

3171
01:19:36.860 --> 01:19:41.840
There are a lot of people that have agreements with their significant other and

3172
01:19:41.841 --> 01:19:45.420
they both go out and bang other people I know love them.

3173
01:19:45.590 --> 01:19:47.090
It's a very logical situation.

3174
01:19:47.810 --> 01:19:50.300
It's pragmatic in some ways.

3175
01:19:50.301 --> 01:19:50.511
Like,

3176
01:19:50.511 --> 01:19:51.021
hey listen,

3177
01:19:51.021 --> 01:19:51.831
we're both retarded.

3178
01:19:51.831 --> 01:19:52.910
We're not going to keep this together,

3179
01:19:52.911 --> 01:19:53.900
so let's just make it a little,

3180
01:19:54.170 --> 01:19:55.430
but that always falls apart too.

3181
01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:55.610
Yeah.

3182
01:19:55.610 --> 01:19:55.971
I think,

3183
01:19:55.971 --> 01:19:58.220
I think it should happen where they don't see it happen.

3184
01:19:58.910 --> 01:19:59.180
You know?

3185
01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:00.630
It's better to tell.

3186
01:20:01.090 --> 01:20:01.570
No you,

3187
01:20:01.570 --> 01:20:02.181
I mean you can,

3188
01:20:02.181 --> 01:20:02.511
you know,

3189
01:20:02.511 --> 01:20:02.811
listen,

3190
01:20:02.811 --> 01:20:03.890
I've got something to do.

3191
01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:04.790
I think you have a code.

3192
01:20:04.791 --> 01:20:05.060
You know,

3193
01:20:05.060 --> 01:20:06.170
I got some to do tonight.

3194
01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:08.310
I'll see you later.

3195
01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:08.491
<v 7>Well,</v>

3196
01:20:08.491 --> 01:20:11.880
we have a friend that was involved in an open marriage and his wife would come

3197
01:20:11.881 --> 01:20:14.220
home and she would talk about all the guys.

3198
01:20:14.221 --> 01:20:16.080
She was fucking and he liked it.

3199
01:20:17.150 --> 01:20:17.450
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

3200
01:20:17.450 --> 01:20:18.390
I mean if that's your look

3201
01:20:18.490 --> 01:20:20.260
<v 7>fried chicken and said that was weird.</v>

3202
01:20:20.261 --> 01:20:21.010
Right?

3203
01:20:21.010 --> 01:20:21.430
Yeah.

3204
01:20:21.430 --> 01:20:22.810
Cause we knew him before that,

3205
01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:27.840
which really crazy is we knew him before that and he had a bad breakup and when,

3206
01:20:28.250 --> 01:20:30.910
when he had the bad breakup but the kid was devastated.

3207
01:20:30.911 --> 01:20:31.990
He wanted to get her back,

3208
01:20:31.991 --> 01:20:34.150
but she wouldn't take him back and he didn't know what to do.

3209
01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:35.400
And you know,

3210
01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:36.820
I should kind of gave me some advice.

3211
01:20:36.821 --> 01:20:37.151
I'm like,

3212
01:20:37.151 --> 01:20:37.471
look it,

3213
01:20:37.471 --> 01:20:38.740
you just got a deal.

3214
01:20:38.741 --> 01:20:39.640
I mean this is just,

3215
01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:40.780
do you love her?

3216
01:20:41.180 --> 01:20:41.591
And he goes,

3217
01:20:41.591 --> 01:20:41.771
yeah.

3218
01:20:41.771 --> 01:20:42.101
And I go,

3219
01:20:42.101 --> 01:20:43.030
well if you love her,

3220
01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:45.340
you've got to want her to be happy.

3221
01:20:45.341 --> 01:20:48.580
And if her being happy means her not having sex with you,

3222
01:20:48.581 --> 01:20:49.450
that's just reality.

3223
01:20:49.451 --> 01:20:51.430
Like you have to accept that that's reality.

3224
01:20:51.431 --> 01:20:53.830
Like there's a lot of people out there that you don't have sex with.

3225
01:20:53.831 --> 01:20:54.520
Right.

3226
01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:55.790
And it just because you,

3227
01:20:56.070 --> 01:20:56.800
I mean,

3228
01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:58.420
because you haven't had sex with him in the past,

3229
01:20:58.421 --> 01:21:01.030
it doesn't drive you nuts that you can't have sex with them now.

3230
01:21:01.090 --> 01:21:01.361
Right.

3231
01:21:01.361 --> 01:21:05.500
So you're just connecting yourself to the relationship that you two used to have

3232
01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:06.910
and that's the only,

3233
01:21:07.150 --> 01:21:09.040
like he won't love her in any other way.

3234
01:21:09.250 --> 01:21:10.600
You need that,

3235
01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:13.390
those parameters in order for you to care about her as a person.

3236
01:21:13.990 --> 01:21:14.231
He's like,

3237
01:21:14.231 --> 01:21:14.861
I just can't do it.

3238
01:21:14.861 --> 01:21:15.694
I can't be her friend.

3239
01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:16.030
I'm like,

3240
01:21:16.030 --> 01:21:16.870
that's so crazy.

3241
01:21:17.050 --> 01:21:17.231
He goes,

3242
01:21:17.231 --> 01:21:17.771
I can't help it.

3243
01:21:17.771 --> 01:21:18.400
I'm jealous.

3244
01:21:18.400 --> 01:21:18.850
I'm just,

3245
01:21:18.850 --> 01:21:19.571
I'm just too jealous.

3246
01:21:19.571 --> 01:21:20.404
I can't do it.

3247
01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:20.651
It's like,

3248
01:21:20.651 --> 01:21:21.100
okay.

3249
01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:22.330
But then right after that,

3250
01:21:22.450 --> 01:21:24.140
he's involved in a fucking open marriage.

3251
01:21:24.141 --> 01:21:25.210
His next relationship,

3252
01:21:25.330 --> 01:21:27.920
he went one 80 he said just she's,

3253
01:21:28.100 --> 01:21:28.630
she's a whore.

3254
01:21:28.630 --> 01:21:30.250
Like he would talk about her being a whore.

3255
01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:31.900
Like he loved it and loved.

3256
01:21:31.901 --> 01:21:32.060
Aw,

3257
01:21:32.060 --> 01:21:32.950
she's so horny.

3258
01:21:32.951 --> 01:21:34.360
It's lovely still fucker too.

3259
01:21:34.450 --> 01:21:35.260
Now they broke up.

3260
01:21:35.260 --> 01:21:35.740
Oh,

3261
01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:36.573
it didn't work,

3262
01:21:38.110 --> 01:21:40.270
but for a while that worked shit for a while.

3263
01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:41.050
He was happy.

3264
01:21:41.050 --> 01:21:41.710
It was weird.

3265
01:21:41.710 --> 01:21:42.311
It was crazy.

3266
01:21:42.311 --> 01:21:43.000
It was just like,

3267
01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:43.960
he tried to not like it.

3268
01:21:44.050 --> 01:21:45.370
He didn't like being a democrat.

3269
01:21:45.371 --> 01:21:45.761
Fuck it.

3270
01:21:45.761 --> 01:21:46.660
I'm going to be a Republican.

3271
01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:47.411
We just,

3272
01:21:47.411 --> 01:21:47.850
we just took,

3273
01:21:47.850 --> 01:21:49.330
went total the other way,

3274
01:21:49.510 --> 01:21:51.700
he went from being like the super jealous,

3275
01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:54.580
like I can't be friends with my ex and les were boyfriend,

3276
01:21:54.581 --> 01:21:54.941
girlfriend.

3277
01:21:54.941 --> 01:21:55.774
That's it.

3278
01:21:55.780 --> 01:21:57.090
To fucking,

3279
01:21:57.190 --> 01:21:58.300
I'm going to just date a swinger.

3280
01:21:59.050 --> 01:22:00.340
Like she would go out with guys,

3281
01:22:00.341 --> 01:22:01.350
I'm going on a date tonight.

3282
01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:02.650
Democrats are swingers.

3283
01:22:02.710 --> 01:22:03.431
And he didn't know,

3284
01:22:03.431 --> 01:22:04.960
I'm just a bad example.

3285
01:22:04.961 --> 01:22:07.330
I should have said like dolphins fan or Raiders fans.

3286
01:22:07.530 --> 01:22:08.680
It's basically the same thing.

3287
01:22:08.890 --> 01:22:09.723
But he,

3288
01:22:09.780 --> 01:22:11.590
he would go out and he would,

3289
01:22:11.591 --> 01:22:12.100
uh,

3290
01:22:12.100 --> 01:22:12.550
you know,

3291
01:22:12.550 --> 01:22:14.800
he would like call you fucking this guy right now.

3292
01:22:14.801 --> 01:22:15.311
And she'd be like,

3293
01:22:15.311 --> 01:22:16.144
Yup.

3294
01:22:16.510 --> 01:22:18.430
And like he would like get excited about it.

3295
01:22:18.460 --> 01:22:19.260
What do jerk off?

3296
01:22:19.260 --> 01:22:19.470
<v 4>I,</v>

3297
01:22:19.470 --> 01:22:21.060
I mean I've banged a swinger,

3298
01:22:21.090 --> 01:22:21.450
uh,

3299
01:22:21.450 --> 01:22:22.350
in front of his wife,

3300
01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:23.290
Oh,

3301
01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:24.180
sorry.

3302
01:22:24.180 --> 01:22:24.571
In front of,

3303
01:22:24.571 --> 01:22:25.290
in front of him.

3304
01:22:25.290 --> 01:22:25.891
In front of him.

3305
01:22:25.891 --> 01:22:26.724
That dude,

3306
01:22:26.790 --> 01:22:27.350
let me rephrase.

3307
01:22:27.350 --> 01:22:30.510
Do you bang the wife?

3308
01:22:30.750 --> 01:22:31.890
The husband was watching.

3309
01:22:32.460 --> 01:22:33.540
Why would you want that?

3310
01:22:33.600 --> 01:22:34.171
I didn't want I,

3311
01:22:34.171 --> 01:22:34.681
but he was like,

3312
01:22:34.681 --> 01:22:36.690
it was an l shaped couch and he sat in one corner.

3313
01:22:36.691 --> 01:22:36.871
I said,

3314
01:22:36.871 --> 01:22:37.890
just don't fucking touch me.

3315
01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:39.953
Don't fucking,

3316
01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:41.253
don't touch me.

3317
01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:45.660
You stay over there and I'll fuck your wife.

3318
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:46.583
<v 7>But did you,</v>

3319
01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:47.350
what if he went,

3320
01:22:47.350 --> 01:22:48.181
I've got to go to the bathroom.

3321
01:22:48.181 --> 01:22:49.200
He came back and he felt something,

3322
01:22:49.201 --> 01:22:49.990
touch your balls.

3323
01:22:49.990 --> 01:22:52.200
<v 4>I would probably turn around and kill the motherfucker,</v>

3324
01:22:52.780 --> 01:22:53.980
but you're fucking his wife.

3325
01:22:53.981 --> 01:22:55.520
It seems rude to kill him when I get,

3326
01:22:55.530 --> 01:22:56.410
I'll tell you the funny story.

3327
01:22:56.440 --> 01:22:56.981
I was,

3328
01:22:56.981 --> 01:22:58.540
we were there at their house.

3329
01:22:58.630 --> 01:22:59.463
It was me and Vernon,

3330
01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:00.370
my buddy,

3331
01:23:00.370 --> 01:23:00.860
uh,

3332
01:23:00.860 --> 01:23:01.720
I don't say any names.

3333
01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:02.230
Yeah,

3334
01:23:02.230 --> 01:23:02.651
my buddy,

3335
01:23:02.651 --> 01:23:03.221
he passed away.

3336
01:23:03.221 --> 01:23:04.054
But uh,

3337
01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:08.200
we're sitting there on couch l shaped couch and she just start leans over and

3338
01:23:08.201 --> 01:23:09.040
starts blowing me.

3339
01:23:09.310 --> 01:23:10.540
Oh boy.

3340
01:23:10.570 --> 01:23:13.970
And then my friends sitting beside me and beside her and he's,

3341
01:23:13.971 --> 01:23:14.591
he's just like,

3342
01:23:14.591 --> 01:23:14.741
you know,

3343
01:23:14.741 --> 01:23:15.341
she's blown me.

3344
01:23:15.341 --> 01:23:17.830
And then the husband and my friend just staring at each other cause the way on

3345
01:23:17.831 --> 01:23:18.664
the other side.

3346
01:23:18.910 --> 01:23:20.350
And my friend just does this like,

3347
01:23:20.351 --> 01:23:20.531
hey,

3348
01:23:20.531 --> 01:23:21.040
is that,

3349
01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:21.491
is that okay?

3350
01:23:21.491 --> 01:23:22.000
Can I,

3351
01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:24.520
can I get some of this as two from her and the husband?

3352
01:23:24.521 --> 01:23:24.791
She goes,

3353
01:23:24.791 --> 01:23:24.971
yeah,

3354
01:23:24.971 --> 01:23:25.804
go ahead.

3355
01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:26.790
Wait.

3356
01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:27.790
So the husband says,

3357
01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:28.211
yeah,

3358
01:23:28.211 --> 01:23:29.440
you can fuck my life too.

3359
01:23:29.441 --> 01:23:31.750
So two guys are drilling so,

3360
01:23:32.050 --> 01:23:32.831
so I'm sitting there,

3361
01:23:32.831 --> 01:23:33.664
she's blowing,

3362
01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:35.350
she's blowing me.

3363
01:23:35.351 --> 01:23:39.880
And then my friend starts fingering her from behind and uh,

3364
01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:40.901
and I'm like,

3365
01:23:40.901 --> 01:23:41.081
all right,

3366
01:23:41.081 --> 01:23:41.530
as long as we're,

3367
01:23:41.530 --> 01:23:42.730
nobody's fucking touching me,

3368
01:23:42.731 --> 01:23:45.250
I'm good at just as long as it's just women on me,

3369
01:23:45.251 --> 01:23:46.084
I'm good.

3370
01:23:46.290 --> 01:23:48.160
Is this guy beaten off or anything?

3371
01:23:48.310 --> 01:23:49.840
The husbands in the corner just stroking it

3372
01:23:54.820 --> 01:23:57.350
far enough away that he can't come on you.

3373
01:23:57.650 --> 01:23:59.440
You Google like what's the longest,

3374
01:23:59.441 --> 01:24:03.190
the longest distance the guys ever call it really an l shaped couch.

3375
01:24:03.191 --> 01:24:04.810
And we're at the short part of the L.

3376
01:24:04.810 --> 01:24:07.780
He's at the fucking far long part of the l I think the world record for shooting

3377
01:24:07.781 --> 01:24:08.051
a load.

3378
01:24:08.051 --> 01:24:08.884
It's like three feet.

3379
01:24:08.890 --> 01:24:10.240
The guy like shot hit my foot.

3380
01:24:10.330 --> 01:24:14.200
Was that Peter Number three feet like three like 12 inches.

3381
01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:14.710
12 inches.

3382
01:24:14.710 --> 01:24:15.543
Well,

3383
01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:16.490
I dunno,

3384
01:24:16.490 --> 01:24:17.380
it might've been Peter North.

3385
01:24:17.650 --> 01:24:20.140
I don't know who's the fall I shot over.

3386
01:24:20.141 --> 01:24:21.370
Girls hadn't hit the wall.

3387
01:24:21.430 --> 01:24:21.820
Whoa.

3388
01:24:21.820 --> 01:24:23.080
You might've be the world record holder.

3389
01:24:23.130 --> 01:24:23.340
I don't know.

3390
01:24:23.340 --> 01:24:24.173
But it was,

3391
01:24:24.260 --> 01:24:25.093
and that was impressive.

3392
01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:27.820
It was funny because I was in my twenties and I shut,

3393
01:24:27.821 --> 01:24:28.870
it was my friend's house.

3394
01:24:28.871 --> 01:24:29.710
I'm banging this broad.

3395
01:24:29.711 --> 01:24:31.510
He walks in and as you walk in,

3396
01:24:31.511 --> 01:24:33.130
the bed was right there and I'm behind her and he goes,

3397
01:24:33.370 --> 01:24:33.521
I go,

3398
01:24:33.521 --> 01:24:33.641
hey,

3399
01:24:33.641 --> 01:24:34.474
can you come back?

3400
01:24:34.720 --> 01:24:34.991
And he goes,

3401
01:24:34.991 --> 01:24:35.380
yeah.

3402
01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:36.101
So he leaves.

3403
01:24:36.101 --> 01:24:38.170
I pull out I nut and not on her back.

3404
01:24:38.171 --> 01:24:39.220
I not on the wall.

3405
01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:40.390
Some of it hits his pill.

3406
01:24:40.391 --> 01:24:41.680
I just flipped his pillow over

3407
01:24:43.810 --> 01:24:44.470
the jellies.

3408
01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:46.210
Use your sleeve to rub it out there.

3409
01:24:46.240 --> 01:24:48.280
Just kind of flipped it over and giggled to myself.

3410
01:24:48.370 --> 01:24:49.380
Oh God,

3411
01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:50.680
you son of a bitch.

3412
01:24:51.060 --> 01:24:54.070
Have you had sex with guys in the room a lot?

3413
01:24:54.140 --> 01:24:54.800
No.

3414
01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:55.633
No worries.

3415
01:24:55.820 --> 01:24:57.720
Sounds that already sounds fucking gay.

3416
01:24:57.721 --> 01:24:58.480
All right now.

3417
01:24:58.480 --> 01:25:00.220
But that's not just guys in the room.

3418
01:25:00.250 --> 01:25:03.040
It's that guy there in her husband and wife safe.

3419
01:25:03.041 --> 01:25:04.570
I understand the safety of the broad,

3420
01:25:04.571 --> 01:25:05.170
you know what I mean?

3421
01:25:05.170 --> 01:25:06.070
I understand that.

3422
01:25:06.100 --> 01:25:07.420
What a sweetheart you are.

3423
01:25:07.480 --> 01:25:09.070
I understand the safety of the broad,

3424
01:25:09.420 --> 01:25:10.180
but I just,

3425
01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:13.150
the guy being in the room beating off would be the deal breaker.

3426
01:25:13.180 --> 01:25:14.680
Like you can watch where you gotta keep it pants.

3427
01:25:14.700 --> 01:25:14.791
Oh,

3428
01:25:14.791 --> 01:25:15.820
I don't even want it guy watch.

3429
01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:17.440
I don't give a fuck.

3430
01:25:17.710 --> 01:25:18.041
It's like,

3431
01:25:18.041 --> 01:25:18.821
you don't touch me.

3432
01:25:18.821 --> 01:25:19.600
You're over there doing,

3433
01:25:19.600 --> 01:25:20.433
she got to do it.

3434
01:25:21.490 --> 01:25:22.061
Why not?

3435
01:25:22.061 --> 01:25:22.241
Right.

3436
01:25:22.241 --> 01:25:25.090
And he was getting off to the fact that we were dropping loads in her mouth and

3437
01:25:25.091 --> 01:25:26.810
then he came in and fucked her right after it.

3438
01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:27.371
Oh,

3439
01:25:27.371 --> 01:25:28.061
good Lord.

3440
01:25:28.061 --> 01:25:28.661
In front of you.

3441
01:25:28.661 --> 01:25:29.320
He fucked her.

3442
01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:29.481
Yeah.

3443
01:25:29.481 --> 01:25:30.281
We just kind of pack.

3444
01:25:30.281 --> 01:25:31.031
I went to the bathroom,

3445
01:25:31.031 --> 01:25:32.060
cleaned up while he was funny.

3446
01:25:32.061 --> 01:25:34.420
Oh my God.

3447
01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:35.020
Okay.

3448
01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:36.100
Does he like,

3449
01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:37.540
I don't want to get graphic,

3450
01:25:37.541 --> 01:25:39.040
but did anybody come in her box?

3451
01:25:39.310 --> 01:25:39.521
No,

3452
01:25:39.521 --> 01:25:39.581
no,

3453
01:25:39.581 --> 01:25:39.860
no.

3454
01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:40.060
I,

3455
01:25:40.060 --> 01:25:41.710
I wore a hat with that always,

3456
01:25:41.711 --> 01:25:42.544
you know?

3457
01:25:42.690 --> 01:25:42.970
Yeah.

3458
01:25:42.970 --> 01:25:44.230
You have that situation.

3459
01:25:44.231 --> 01:25:44.341
I'm,

3460
01:25:44.341 --> 01:25:44.600
I'm,

3461
01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:44.760
I'm,

3462
01:25:44.760 --> 01:25:44.911
I'm,

3463
01:25:44.911 --> 01:25:45.671
I'm strapping up.

3464
01:25:45.671 --> 01:25:46.690
I'm putting on my Hazmat.

3465
01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:47.673
So yeah,

3466
01:25:48.490 --> 01:25:48.941
for sure.

3467
01:25:48.941 --> 01:25:50.410
That's not the first time they've done that.

3468
01:25:50.440 --> 01:25:50.860
Right.

3469
01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:52.000
She might have some Ebola.

3470
01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:52.351
Oh No,

3471
01:25:52.351 --> 01:25:52.510
no.

3472
01:25:52.510 --> 01:25:53.430
She's a shoes.

3473
01:25:53.770 --> 01:25:55.180
They're meant hardcore smokers,

3474
01:25:56.290 --> 01:25:57.123
Florida.

3475
01:25:57.400 --> 01:25:57.651
No,

3476
01:25:57.651 --> 01:25:59.590
Toronto even crazier.

3477
01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:01.510
The first time I banged her was in front of him.

3478
01:26:01.511 --> 01:26:04.190
It was on some orgy in Vegas during the AVN,

3479
01:26:04.190 --> 01:26:05.023
<v 3>so years ago.</v>

3480
01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:06.320
Oh my God.

3481
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:09.470
And it was like I'm banging her and then some other brides are getting fucked on

3482
01:26:09.471 --> 01:26:10.221
the bed and I'm just like,

3483
01:26:10.221 --> 01:26:11.060
this is great.

3484
01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:11.570
I'm like,

3485
01:26:11.570 --> 01:26:13.160
I'm fucking her watching her get drilled.

3486
01:26:13.161 --> 01:26:14.150
This is like porn,

3487
01:26:14.151 --> 01:26:15.290
like real life born.

3488
01:26:15.450 --> 01:26:16.500
<v 7>People do go at it.</v>

3489
01:26:17.910 --> 01:26:18.960
I went to a party once,

3490
01:26:18.961 --> 01:26:19.531
way,

3491
01:26:19.531 --> 01:26:19.891
way,

3492
01:26:19.891 --> 01:26:22.770
way back in the day at the palms and uh,

3493
01:26:22.771 --> 01:26:26.340
we went up there to run into a friend and he was up there.

3494
01:26:26.341 --> 01:26:26.900
He goes,

3495
01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:27.181
come here.

3496
01:26:27.181 --> 01:26:28.110
You want to see something crazy?

3497
01:26:28.140 --> 01:26:28.321
I go,

3498
01:26:28.321 --> 01:26:28.471
yeah,

3499
01:26:28.471 --> 01:26:29.010
sure.

3500
01:26:29.010 --> 01:26:30.360
We go into this man is like,

3501
01:26:30.420 --> 01:26:33.330
somebody had rented this nutty sweet that had like,

3502
01:26:33.690 --> 01:26:34.141
it had a,

3503
01:26:34.141 --> 01:26:35.580
I'm a swimming pool,

3504
01:26:35.581 --> 01:26:37.470
like an outdoor area where they have it ahead.

3505
01:26:37.471 --> 01:26:39.720
A private swimming pool was like this insane sweet.

3506
01:26:39.721 --> 01:26:40.950
Who knows how much money does it cost?

3507
01:26:41.250 --> 01:26:45.270
We go out into this main room and there's a group of people around and they're

3508
01:26:45.271 --> 01:26:49.800
watching these chicks each other out and like this is like a movie,

3509
01:26:50.070 --> 01:26:52.110
like this is like a movie and a,

3510
01:26:52.111 --> 01:26:52.740
and he goes,

3511
01:26:52.740 --> 01:26:56.130
you always got to watch stuff like this because chicks will try to outsmart each

3512
01:26:56.131 --> 01:26:56.640
other.

3513
01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:57.450
Like watch,

3514
01:26:57.450 --> 01:26:58.410
like it'll accelerate.

3515
01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:01.500
So we're watching and as these two girls are eating each other out,

3516
01:27:01.501 --> 01:27:04.400
other girls started jumping in and they start pulling their tits out and stuff

3517
01:27:04.401 --> 01:27:07.740
at him and his girl's mouths and everybody has their own like little thing,

3518
01:27:07.741 --> 01:27:09.360
like how far they're willing to take it.

3519
01:27:09.361 --> 01:27:13.170
And some girls are just taking their pants off and bending their their ass and

3520
01:27:13.171 --> 01:27:15.600
other girls' faces and girls that they didn't even know him,

3521
01:27:15.601 --> 01:27:18.840
grabbed their ass and just started eating their pussy in front of everybody.

3522
01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:19.381
And I was like,

3523
01:27:19.381 --> 01:27:20.070
this is crazy.

3524
01:27:20.070 --> 01:27:21.060
How come I'm not at these,

3525
01:27:21.090 --> 01:27:21.600
this guy?

3526
01:27:21.600 --> 01:27:22.710
But this guy predicted it.

3527
01:27:22.711 --> 01:27:23.880
He predicted a whole off

3528
01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:25.960
<v 3>and it really became,</v>

3529
01:27:25.961 --> 01:27:27.370
it was a hoe down guy

3530
01:27:27.710 --> 01:27:29.060
<v 7>tried to outsmart each other.</v>

3531
01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:30.770
Who knows who's on what,

3532
01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:32.180
how many of were on Axis II?

3533
01:27:32.181 --> 01:27:33.080
Probably all of them.

3534
01:27:33.081 --> 01:27:33.770
Right.

3535
01:27:33.770 --> 01:27:34.603
But it was like,

3536
01:27:34.670 --> 01:27:38.120
this is like when you see a movie about an out of control,

3537
01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:40.790
drug fueled Hollywood type party,

3538
01:27:40.850 --> 01:27:41.683
this is what you say.

3539
01:27:42.170 --> 01:27:43.040
And this was in Vegas.

3540
01:27:43.041 --> 01:27:46.880
And people just walking around them go into where the drinks are going back and

3541
01:27:46.881 --> 01:27:47.630
forth,

3542
01:27:47.630 --> 01:27:47.930
you know,

3543
01:27:47.930 --> 01:27:48.171
it was,

3544
01:27:48.171 --> 01:27:48.740
it was ridiculous.

3545
01:27:48.740 --> 01:27:49.880
It was totally ridiculous.

3546
01:27:50.510 --> 01:27:50.691
<v 3>See,</v>

3547
01:27:50.691 --> 01:27:51.740
I like things like that.

3548
01:27:52.420 --> 01:27:53.060
I'm like,

3549
01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:55.190
I'm going to get people that take chances.

3550
01:27:55.250 --> 01:27:56.140
So there's some of,

3551
01:27:56.190 --> 01:27:57.410
and I'm a fan of the,

3552
01:27:57.660 --> 01:27:57.880
uh,

3553
01:27:57.880 --> 01:27:58.341
of the,

3554
01:27:58.341 --> 01:27:58.970
uh,

3555
01:27:58.970 --> 01:27:59.580
of the freestyle

3556
01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:00.180
<v 7>Barrett.</v>

3557
01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:00.541
Yeah.

3558
01:28:00.541 --> 01:28:01.530
There's some beauty in that,

3559
01:28:01.531 --> 01:28:01.830
right?

3560
01:28:01.830 --> 01:28:05.610
There's some beauty and just taking a wild fucking chance like that.

3561
01:28:05.611 --> 01:28:06.444
Why not?

3562
01:28:06.590 --> 01:28:07.560
What are you gonna live forever?

3563
01:28:08.190 --> 01:28:12.060
But is it okay to like live your whole life and birth to death and never do

3564
01:28:12.061 --> 01:28:12.894
that,

3565
01:28:12.930 --> 01:28:14.610
or is it better to do that and go,

3566
01:28:14.690 --> 01:28:15.150
I won't,

3567
01:28:15.150 --> 01:28:15.940
I don't want to do that again.

3568
01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:16.151
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

3569
01:28:16.151 --> 01:28:16.820
It's like,

3570
01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:17.100
oh,

3571
01:28:17.100 --> 01:28:17.933
I'd rather have,

3572
01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:19.420
I'd rather have a life of Oh,

3573
01:28:19.421 --> 01:28:20.780
wells rather than what if,

3574
01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:21.733
you know,

3575
01:28:22.120 --> 01:28:22.630
yeah.

3576
01:28:22.630 --> 01:28:23.463
Or a life of,

3577
01:28:23.730 --> 01:28:24.810
I probably should have done that.

3578
01:28:25.030 --> 01:28:25.863
Fuck.

3579
01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:29.950
Well,

3580
01:28:29.950 --> 01:28:31.000
don't you think also

3581
01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:33.510
<v 7>you have a very different life than most people.</v>

3582
01:28:33.540 --> 01:28:35.070
You're a professional entertainer,

3583
01:28:35.100 --> 01:28:36.300
a standup comedian.

3584
01:28:36.301 --> 01:28:36.951
Extraordinary.

3585
01:28:36.951 --> 01:28:37.210
This

3586
01:28:37.210 --> 01:28:37.480
<v 3>is the,</v>

3587
01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:38.020
this is,

3588
01:28:38.020 --> 01:28:40.570
this is the reason I indulge in all this because I'm like,

3589
01:28:40.990 --> 01:28:43.180
I still view myself like a regular person.

3590
01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:45.040
So when these things happen,

3591
01:28:45.041 --> 01:28:45.700
I go,

3592
01:28:45.700 --> 01:28:47.080
can you fucking believe that shit?

3593
01:28:47.350 --> 01:28:47.860
Yeah.

3594
01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:48.551
Like in my head,

3595
01:28:48.551 --> 01:28:50.320
I'm still the guy that works in the mall,

3596
01:28:50.380 --> 01:28:50.980
you know what I mean?

3597
01:28:50.980 --> 01:28:51.400
Right,

3598
01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:52.180
right.

3599
01:28:52.180 --> 01:28:53.140
When these things are happening,

3600
01:28:53.141 --> 01:28:54.670
I want to call my friends back home.

3601
01:28:54.671 --> 01:28:54.970
Like,

3602
01:28:54.970 --> 01:28:55.690
Yo,

3603
01:28:55.690 --> 01:28:58.450
these fucking chicks are eating each other out at this party.

3604
01:28:58.900 --> 01:28:59.411
You know what I mean?

3605
01:28:59.411 --> 01:29:00.011
My friends were like,

3606
01:29:00.011 --> 01:29:02.130
where are you at the mall?

3607
01:29:02.210 --> 01:29:03.043
<v 4>You know?</v>

3608
01:29:04.590 --> 01:29:09.590
<v 2>Do you have a hard time like accepting the fact that you're look ridiculously</v>

3609
01:29:09.751 --> 01:29:10.584
famous?

3610
01:29:10.710 --> 01:29:11.270
<v 4>Uh,</v>

3611
01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:13.020
I certain circles you ridiculous.

3612
01:29:13.021 --> 01:29:13.790
You're famous.

3613
01:29:13.790 --> 01:29:13.970
Yeah.

3614
01:29:13.970 --> 01:29:14.320
And,

3615
01:29:14.320 --> 01:29:16.210
and when I'm around a regular people,

3616
01:29:16.211 --> 01:29:17.080
I'm ridiculously famous,

3617
01:29:17.081 --> 01:29:18.250
but when I'm around famous people,

3618
01:29:18.251 --> 01:29:19.240
I'm ridiculously normal.

3619
01:29:19.870 --> 01:29:20.501
That's true.

3620
01:29:20.501 --> 01:29:21.010
Right.

3621
01:29:21.010 --> 01:29:21.311
You know,

3622
01:29:21.311 --> 01:29:23.710
like ridiculously famous.

3623
01:29:23.711 --> 01:29:24.940
You can make anything happen.

3624
01:29:25.240 --> 01:29:26.230
Let's Tom Cruise.

3625
01:29:26.650 --> 01:29:27.483
Kanye West.

3626
01:29:27.610 --> 01:29:28.090
Yeah.

3627
01:29:28.090 --> 01:29:28.331
No,

3628
01:29:28.331 --> 01:29:29.164
your height.

3629
01:29:29.310 --> 01:29:29.560
Yeah.

3630
01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:30.670
When Siri knows your height,

3631
01:29:30.700 --> 01:29:31.960
that's where that's when you've made it.

3632
01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:33.200
But does it the height of me.

3633
01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:33.570
<v 2>Can you,</v>

3634
01:29:33.570 --> 01:29:35.610
when you're doing these like 18,000 seat arenas,

3635
01:29:35.611 --> 01:29:38.080
is it freak you out when you get out there and you stand on that stage or

3636
01:29:38.081 --> 01:29:39.390
they're all there to see you and they go nuts.

3637
01:29:40.140 --> 01:29:40.430
<v 4>I,</v>

3638
01:29:40.430 --> 01:29:41.310
I still dig it.

3639
01:29:41.311 --> 01:29:41.730
You know,

3640
01:29:41.730 --> 01:29:42.470
I still kind of,

3641
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:43.303
I,

3642
01:29:43.470 --> 01:29:45.330
I'm involved with it the same way.

3643
01:29:45.331 --> 01:29:46.770
The audiences like,

3644
01:29:46.771 --> 01:29:46.951
Hey,

3645
01:29:46.951 --> 01:29:47.970
can you believe this shit?

3646
01:29:48.510 --> 01:29:49.111
That's funny.

3647
01:29:49.111 --> 01:29:49.411
You know,

3648
01:29:49.411 --> 01:29:49.561
it's,

3649
01:29:49.561 --> 01:29:49.981
it's not,

3650
01:29:49.981 --> 01:29:50.400
uh,

3651
01:29:50.400 --> 01:29:51.960
it's not a bow to me.

3652
01:29:52.200 --> 01:29:53.550
You knew you should've been here.

3653
01:29:53.551 --> 01:29:54.630
Even I walk out like,

3654
01:29:54.720 --> 01:29:55.051
fuck,

3655
01:29:55.051 --> 01:29:55.884
are you doing here?

3656
01:29:56.010 --> 01:29:57.360
That's why you're not Kanye West.

3657
01:29:57.480 --> 01:29:59.130
That's exactly why we're Jesus.

3658
01:29:59.740 --> 01:30:00.640
<v 2>I wrote there</v>

3659
01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:05.460
Yeezus what diseases that him,

3660
01:30:05.520 --> 01:30:06.450
what does Kanye,

3661
01:30:06.810 --> 01:30:07.231
Kanye.

3662
01:30:07.231 --> 01:30:07.651
Jesus.

3663
01:30:07.651 --> 01:30:08.484
Jesus.

3664
01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:09.413
Oh boy,

3665
01:30:09.870 --> 01:30:10.703
that's rough.

3666
01:30:11.580 --> 01:30:12.360
That is rough.

3667
01:30:12.360 --> 01:30:13.050
You know,

3668
01:30:13.050 --> 01:30:14.490
some people have a god complex.

3669
01:30:14.850 --> 01:30:15.750
Do you think that's what it is?

3670
01:30:16.140 --> 01:30:21.000
You have to at some point a view yourself like that in order to call yourself.

3671
01:30:21.001 --> 01:30:23.300
He says it's just,

3672
01:30:23.350 --> 01:30:24.660
you're fucking hilarious name.

3673
01:30:24.661 --> 01:30:24.850
You know,

3674
01:30:24.850 --> 01:30:25.780
if this was the Middle East,

3675
01:30:25.781 --> 01:30:26.614
he be Jala.

3676
01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:27.793
Um,

3677
01:30:28.260 --> 01:30:28.890
that's right.

3678
01:30:28.890 --> 01:30:29.241
Or [inaudible].

3679
01:30:29.241 --> 01:30:30.940
Hammad y'all wait,

3680
01:30:30.960 --> 01:30:31.960
how do you spell Yahweh?

3681
01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:33.380
Yahweh.

3682
01:30:33.380 --> 01:30:34.560
Yahweh is God,

3683
01:30:34.780 --> 01:30:35.280
is it?

3684
01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:35.910
Yeah.

3685
01:30:35.910 --> 01:30:37.050
It's one of the names for God.

3686
01:30:37.930 --> 01:30:38.930
Why a,

3687
01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:41.040
why a w e or something like that.

3688
01:30:41.190 --> 01:30:43.410
Y'All way I got w e y maybe.

3689
01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:43.571
Yeah.

3690
01:30:43.571 --> 01:30:43.730
Well,

3691
01:30:43.730 --> 01:30:43.830
yeah,

3692
01:30:43.830 --> 01:30:47.250
there's a bunch of different names for God to John Jehovah.

3693
01:30:47.340 --> 01:30:47.700
Yeah.

3694
01:30:47.700 --> 01:30:48.780
Depending on the time,

3695
01:30:48.810 --> 01:30:49.643
the place,

3696
01:30:49.830 --> 01:30:50.071
<v 4>I mean,</v>

3697
01:30:50.071 --> 01:30:50.460
you know,

3698
01:30:50.460 --> 01:30:50.730
in a,

3699
01:30:50.730 --> 01:30:51.391
in all fairness,

3700
01:30:51.391 --> 01:30:53.390
I think Kanye calling small fuses.

3701
01:30:53.650 --> 01:30:56.840
Jay Z was calling himself Jay Jay Hove Jehovah.

3702
01:30:57.000 --> 01:30:57.451
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

3703
01:30:57.451 --> 01:30:58.500
that's true for that.

3704
01:30:58.501 --> 01:30:59.160
So,

3705
01:30:59.160 --> 01:30:59.971
but it seemed cute.

3706
01:30:59.971 --> 01:31:02.100
Old dirty bastard was calling himself God.

3707
01:31:02.300 --> 01:31:03.180
Was he a big baby?

3708
01:31:03.181 --> 01:31:04.470
Jesus remember all Dads,

3709
01:31:04.471 --> 01:31:05.040
right?

3710
01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:06.780
He called himself big baby Jesus.

3711
01:31:07.110 --> 01:31:07.890
He's dead now.

3712
01:31:07.890 --> 01:31:08.490
Yeah.

3713
01:31:08.490 --> 01:31:09.323
Much respect.

3714
01:31:09.330 --> 01:31:10.180
Rest in peace.

3715
01:31:11.010 --> 01:31:11.843
<v 8>Okay.</v>

3716
01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:17.150
<v 2>Old dirty bastard was a perfect example of a guy that was just fucking as out</v>

3717
01:31:17.151 --> 01:31:20.270
there as you can get for the level of fame and levels.

3718
01:31:20.640 --> 01:31:22.220
Song Rawhide that he did.

3719
01:31:23.690 --> 01:31:24.501
I have it on my phone.

3720
01:31:24.501 --> 01:31:25.230
If it was his,

3721
01:31:25.230 --> 01:31:26.510
his big hit.

3722
01:31:26.540 --> 01:31:27.710
He had like one zoo.

3723
01:31:28.310 --> 01:31:28.491
No,

3724
01:31:28.491 --> 01:31:30.290
he had another one like a sex one.

3725
01:31:33.020 --> 01:31:33.853
<v 4>Fuck,</v>

3726
01:31:34.220 --> 01:31:34.881
give me baby.

3727
01:31:34.881 --> 01:31:35.714
I got your money.

3728
01:31:35.810 --> 01:31:36.643
Yes.

3729
01:31:37.190 --> 01:31:38.060
<v 8>Got Your mind.</v>

3730
01:31:38.061 --> 01:31:38.450
Yeah.

3731
01:31:38.450 --> 01:31:39.283
Yeah.

3732
01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:41.340
<v 2>Better give me that money.</v>

3733
01:31:41.610 --> 01:31:42.443
Hey,

3734
01:31:42.810 --> 01:31:44.800
can I play rawhide or do you guys going to clear that shit?

3735
01:31:44.810 --> 01:31:45.600
Money.

3736
01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:46.950
Most likely we have to clear it,

3737
01:31:47.020 --> 01:31:48.630
but I bet if you play it off your phone,

3738
01:31:48.810 --> 01:31:49.650
they won't pick up.

3739
01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:51.153
<v 8>Okay.</v>

3740
01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:53.453
<v 0>Bastard.</v>

3741
01:31:53.490 --> 01:31:54.400
I didn't know you were,

3742
01:31:57.890 --> 01:31:59.800
<v 4>but in this song he's just fucking,</v>

3743
01:32:00.150 --> 01:32:01.180
he just starts rambling.

3744
01:32:01.390 --> 01:32:01.781
You're like,

3745
01:32:01.781 --> 01:32:02.614
what?

3746
01:32:12.020 --> 01:32:14.120
You could tell he was locked up when he did this.

3747
01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:18.970
It's like listening to no quarter by led Zeppelin.

3748
01:32:19.440 --> 01:32:20.680
They were high shit when they wrote.

3749
01:32:20.681 --> 01:32:24.930
This is awesome fantasy with Mariah Carey.

3750
01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:25.531
Oh,

3751
01:32:25.531 --> 01:32:26.251
that's right.

3752
01:32:26.251 --> 01:32:26.411
Yeah,

3753
01:32:26.411 --> 01:32:26.600
yeah,

3754
01:32:26.600 --> 01:32:27.433
yeah,

3755
01:32:30.850 --> 01:32:31.683
yeah.

3756
01:32:32.430 --> 01:32:33.263
Oh,

3757
01:32:33.390 --> 01:32:34.040
Whoa,

3758
01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:34.780
whoa.

3759
01:32:34.780 --> 01:32:36.970
On a scale of one to 10 how close do you think you run?

3760
01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:37.860
Mariah Carey's?

3761
01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:39.900
I'm thinking she's pretty up there.

3762
01:32:40.120 --> 01:32:40.641
That's got you.

3763
01:32:40.641 --> 01:32:40.841
Gotta.

3764
01:32:40.841 --> 01:32:44.610
You gotta figure you've been detached from reality for at least 20 years at

3765
01:32:44.611 --> 01:32:45.061
least.

3766
01:32:45.061 --> 01:32:45.620
Right?

3767
01:32:45.620 --> 01:32:49.770
At least 20 the crazy superstardom stadium rock.

3768
01:32:51.910 --> 01:32:52.140
Yeah.

3769
01:32:52.140 --> 01:32:52.261
Well,

3770
01:32:52.261 --> 01:32:54.510
you could tell when she did that Christmas thing and her voice was all fucked

3771
01:32:54.511 --> 01:32:54.690
up.

3772
01:32:54.690 --> 01:32:56.610
Remember recently wasn't that,

3773
01:32:56.611 --> 01:32:58.230
isn't she going through a divorce though?

3774
01:32:58.350 --> 01:32:58.801
Yeah.

3775
01:32:58.801 --> 01:33:00.330
I mean you've got to give somebody a little,

3776
01:33:01.610 --> 01:33:01.861
well,

3777
01:33:01.861 --> 01:33:03.990
space can't be performed,

3778
01:33:03.991 --> 01:33:04.800
you know,

3779
01:33:04.800 --> 01:33:05.130
I mean,

3780
01:33:05.130 --> 01:33:05.963
I think if you're going,

3781
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:08.960
especially for a woman when you're going through something like that and you now

3782
01:33:08.970 --> 01:33:11.190
your music is depending on your emotions.

3783
01:33:12.410 --> 01:33:12.980
Fuck,

3784
01:33:12.980 --> 01:33:14.360
you should probably sit back and,

3785
01:33:14.490 --> 01:33:15.750
and bow out for a minute.

3786
01:33:16.440 --> 01:33:16.771
Yeah.

3787
01:33:16.771 --> 01:33:18.420
But maybe she can't do that.

3788
01:33:18.690 --> 01:33:18.871
You know,

3789
01:33:18.871 --> 01:33:20.070
maybe they have obligations.

3790
01:33:20.190 --> 01:33:22.920
I would imagine someone like Mariah Carey's probably booked every day,

3791
01:33:22.950 --> 01:33:23.491
all day.

3792
01:33:23.491 --> 01:33:27.000
He's got shit to bring that paper hands Sutton.

3793
01:33:27.690 --> 01:33:28.950
I think her papers pretty fine.

3794
01:33:29.610 --> 01:33:30.810
Paper flowing though,

3795
01:33:30.811 --> 01:33:31.644
kid,

3796
01:33:34.350 --> 01:33:35.990
that mother fucker's got enough money to,

3797
01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:37.190
doesn't mean whatever.

3798
01:33:37.380 --> 01:33:38.310
I think he gets paid.

3799
01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:38.971
I think,

3800
01:33:38.971 --> 01:33:39.210
uh,

3801
01:33:39.210 --> 01:33:41.380
if you have to rich people and one of them is richer,

3802
01:33:41.710 --> 01:33:43.080
the rich Arab probably has to pay.

3803
01:33:43.450 --> 01:33:45.630
And how many Jay Z and Beyonce divvy up.

3804
01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:46.071
That's it.

3805
01:33:46.071 --> 01:33:47.010
It's pretty gcal match.

3806
01:33:47.011 --> 01:33:47.420
Now,

3807
01:33:47.420 --> 01:33:48.253
is that equal?

3808
01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:50.620
Pretty close knit canyons?

3809
01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:51.170
Uh,

3810
01:33:51.170 --> 01:33:52.003
their opinion,

3811
01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:53.520
that's just a porn name.

3812
01:33:53.521 --> 01:33:55.770
That's the Spanish version with the little thing over the end.

3813
01:33:56.370 --> 01:33:57.660
He actually is writing like,

3814
01:33:57.690 --> 01:34:00.660
there's all these rumors that he's writing this whole album.

3815
01:34:00.661 --> 01:34:03.360
Just bashing Mariah Carey through the whole entire album,

3816
01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:05.460
but amusing albums next album.

3817
01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:07.020
I don't think he needs that either.

3818
01:34:07.770 --> 01:34:08.603
Hmm.

3819
01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:09.360
Yeah.

3820
01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:10.620
He's never had a hit record.

3821
01:34:10.621 --> 01:34:15.570
So whenever we have to do to keep him from doing stand up and I say keep them

3822
01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:16.980
from making music too.

3823
01:34:16.981 --> 01:34:17.814
I think.

3824
01:34:18.060 --> 01:34:18.691
I'm just kidding.

3825
01:34:18.691 --> 01:34:19.020
Nick.

3826
01:34:19.020 --> 01:34:19.853
I don't even know you.

3827
01:34:19.860 --> 01:34:20.790
I'm sure you're a good dude.

3828
01:34:20.820 --> 01:34:21.481
It was just an easy,

3829
01:34:21.481 --> 01:34:22.620
he's a nice enough kid.

3830
01:34:22.650 --> 01:34:23.350
Never had a Mac.

3831
01:34:23.350 --> 01:34:24.690
They never even heard your stand up.

3832
01:34:24.750 --> 01:34:29.670
But I know we had Jay a big Jay Oakerson was joking around about it.

3833
01:34:29.730 --> 01:34:29.971
Well,

3834
01:34:29.971 --> 01:34:30.480
it's,

3835
01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:30.871
I mean,

3836
01:34:30.871 --> 01:34:31.150
I'm,

3837
01:34:31.150 --> 01:34:31.340
I'm,

3838
01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:31.620
I,

3839
01:34:31.620 --> 01:34:33.960
I dare say I'm a friend of Nick's,

3840
01:34:33.961 --> 01:34:36.390
but how dare you let me joke about him.

3841
01:34:36.391 --> 01:34:36.571
Like,

3842
01:34:36.571 --> 01:34:37.020
but wait,

3843
01:34:37.020 --> 01:34:37.651
but I will,

3844
01:34:37.651 --> 01:34:37.890
uh,

3845
01:34:37.890 --> 01:34:42.030
I will coastline that his standup is not very solid without just sinks.

3846
01:34:42.031 --> 01:34:42.864
It.

3847
01:34:43.020 --> 01:34:44.280
We met up at the airport that we're in time.

3848
01:34:44.281 --> 01:34:46.740
Remember it right before it was like seven years ago.

3849
01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:47.880
Eight years ago at Burbank.

3850
01:34:48.630 --> 01:34:49.320
Oh yeah.

3851
01:34:49.320 --> 01:34:50.490
Now back in the day,

3852
01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:51.720
it's a nice enough kid,

3853
01:34:52.980 --> 01:34:53.813
I'm sure.

3854
01:34:54.330 --> 01:34:54.961
But when a guy,

3855
01:34:54.961 --> 01:34:55.710
uh,

3856
01:34:55.710 --> 01:34:56.240
you know,

3857
01:34:56.240 --> 01:34:57.740
gets divorced from Carey,

3858
01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:01.430
I think there's going to be some repercussions and he's much younger than her as

3859
01:35:01.431 --> 01:35:01.730
well.

3860
01:35:01.730 --> 01:35:02.180
Is He?

3861
01:35:02.180 --> 01:35:02.570
Oh yeah.

3862
01:35:02.570 --> 01:35:03.290
How old is she?

3863
01:35:03.290 --> 01:35:04.460
She's gotta be in her forties right.

3864
01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:05.570
And she easily,

3865
01:35:05.960 --> 01:35:06.793
what'd you hit it?

3866
01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:07.490
Fuck yeah.

3867
01:35:07.490 --> 01:35:08.180
Now?

3868
01:35:08.180 --> 01:35:08.720
Yeah.

3869
01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:09.410
Why not?

3870
01:35:09.410 --> 01:35:09.741
Why not?

3871
01:35:09.741 --> 01:35:11.230
Who will just the story.

3872
01:35:11.420 --> 01:35:11.630
Yeah,

3873
01:35:11.630 --> 01:35:12.470
I fucked Mariah Carey.

3874
01:35:13.070 --> 01:35:13.550
The story.

3875
01:35:13.550 --> 01:35:17.990
Would that be 45 she's 45 and Nick's one 33 four.

3876
01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:20.390
Would you say have her sing happy birthday while you're banging on?

3877
01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:23.070
I would have her sing whenever she wanted and I'd make her sing emotion.

3878
01:35:30.250 --> 01:35:31.180
<v 9>Make you come quicker.</v>

3879
01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:32.630
Hit that high note,

3880
01:35:32.630 --> 01:35:33.610
hit that high note.

3881
01:35:35.900 --> 01:35:37.230
<v 4>Ah,</v>

3882
01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:39.033
the clamp.

3883
01:35:41.350 --> 01:35:44.470
Those celebrity romance type things,

3884
01:35:44.500 --> 01:35:45.790
they hardly ever work out.

3885
01:35:45.820 --> 01:35:46.130
Right.

3886
01:35:46.130 --> 01:35:49.050
We're too like superstar famous people don't know.

3887
01:35:49.060 --> 01:35:51.250
The problem is she was more famous than he was.

3888
01:35:51.460 --> 01:35:52.180
That's the problem.

3889
01:35:52.180 --> 01:35:54.400
And she was there around a lot longer than he was.

3890
01:35:54.401 --> 01:35:56.440
So she has legendary status and he has,

3891
01:35:56.920 --> 01:35:57.753
you know,

3892
01:35:57.880 --> 01:35:58.810
newbie status,

3893
01:35:58.900 --> 01:35:59.620
so to speak.

3894
01:35:59.620 --> 01:36:00.453
It's not as good.

3895
01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:01.331
You can't,

3896
01:36:01.331 --> 01:36:01.571
uh,

3897
01:36:01.571 --> 01:36:02.021
you can't,

3898
01:36:02.021 --> 01:36:02.950
you can't bank on that.

3899
01:36:04.060 --> 01:36:04.780
Is that what it is?

3900
01:36:04.780 --> 01:36:05.710
That's where it went wrong.

3901
01:36:06.340 --> 01:36:06.881
I think so.

3902
01:36:06.881 --> 01:36:07.121
I mean,

3903
01:36:07.121 --> 01:36:08.410
it's two different levels of fame.

3904
01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:09.490
That's the problem.

3905
01:36:09.490 --> 01:36:09.641
Yeah.

3906
01:36:09.641 --> 01:36:11.580
I fuck in my level of fame and everything.

3907
01:36:11.660 --> 01:36:12.490
It's possible.

3908
01:36:12.490 --> 01:36:13.390
I took an extra,

3909
01:36:13.420 --> 01:36:13.961
you know what I mean?

3910
01:36:13.961 --> 01:36:14.980
And that's a good move.

3911
01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:15.640
Yeah.

3912
01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:16.151
And you know,

3913
01:36:16.151 --> 01:36:16.541
you can't,

3914
01:36:16.541 --> 01:36:19.000
you can't fuck the leading lady unless we were the leading man.

3915
01:36:19.330 --> 01:36:20.031
But even if you deal,

3916
01:36:20.031 --> 01:36:21.070
you can't go backwards.

3917
01:36:21.480 --> 01:36:21.631
Yeah,

3918
01:36:21.631 --> 01:36:22.061
you can.

3919
01:36:22.061 --> 01:36:22.871
But he's always done.

3920
01:36:22.871 --> 01:36:24.010
He fucked Kim Kardashian.

3921
01:36:24.011 --> 01:36:25.530
He was Christina Milian.

3922
01:36:25.690 --> 01:36:27.850
He's been through a lot of really good chicks.

3923
01:36:27.940 --> 01:36:28.990
How dare nick cannon.

3924
01:36:29.590 --> 01:36:30.450
I'm going if that bothers,

3925
01:36:30.910 --> 01:36:31.800
I think that's what the,

3926
01:36:31.870 --> 01:36:36.130
what was the catalyst for them breaking up was he started naming off names.

3927
01:36:36.490 --> 01:36:36.970
Really?

3928
01:36:36.970 --> 01:36:37.301
Yeah.

3929
01:36:37.301 --> 01:36:37.781
But the chicks,

3930
01:36:37.781 --> 01:36:38.320
these bank.

3931
01:36:38.320 --> 01:36:39.130
Yeah.

3932
01:36:39.130 --> 01:36:40.570
And then Mariah Mariah's like enough.

3933
01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:41.021
Yeah.

3934
01:36:41.021 --> 01:36:41.770
Like what are you doing?

3935
01:36:41.770 --> 01:36:42.790
You're fucking married demeanor.

3936
01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:44.390
You're talking about other chicks at your banging teddy,

3937
01:36:44.430 --> 01:36:45.263
your bang.

3938
01:36:45.370 --> 01:36:46.990
How do we know that it's us talking shit.

3939
01:36:47.740 --> 01:36:49.690
We're just talking shit about some people we don't even know.

3940
01:36:49.900 --> 01:36:51.940
That's what Jamie does is time off.

3941
01:36:55.690 --> 01:36:59.470
I wonder if Jesus stays up at night thinking about the guys that Kim Kardashians

3942
01:36:59.470 --> 01:37:01.540
Bang when you were like a really like egotistical dude.

3943
01:37:01.541 --> 01:37:05.500
It's probably very difficult to deal with the fact that a lot of the guys hit

3944
01:37:05.501 --> 01:37:05.800
that.

3945
01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:06.101
Yeah.

3946
01:37:06.101 --> 01:37:07.600
And there's a video proof.

3947
01:37:08.530 --> 01:37:09.311
That's the worst part.

3948
01:37:09.311 --> 01:37:11.920
And she had a show where she was with her other husband,

3949
01:37:12.610 --> 01:37:13.080
you know?

3950
01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:15.070
I mean she was on her show with that other dude,

3951
01:37:15.071 --> 01:37:16.570
the basketball player dude man.

3952
01:37:16.571 --> 01:37:17.404
That's right.

3953
01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:19.211
Yeah,

3954
01:37:19.211 --> 01:37:19.811
she's a,

3955
01:37:19.811 --> 01:37:20.644
you know,

3956
01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:23.553
I don't know what to say,

3957
01:37:24.010 --> 01:37:24.843
but he gonna say,

3958
01:37:25.030 --> 01:37:25.570
you know,

3959
01:37:25.570 --> 01:37:27.670
what were you thinking about saying I don't,

3960
01:37:27.671 --> 01:37:27.940
you know,

3961
01:37:27.940 --> 01:37:32.180
we're in that fucking weird time where people are famous for no talent and not

3962
01:37:32.200 --> 01:37:32.981
that many though,

3963
01:37:32.981 --> 01:37:33.791
which is weird.

3964
01:37:33.791 --> 01:37:35.890
It's like for every one that gets through the net,

3965
01:37:35.891 --> 01:37:36.970
like Kim Kardashian,

3966
01:37:36.971 --> 01:37:40.060
like how many of them are famous for just a few moments and then it fades away.

3967
01:37:40.061 --> 01:37:41.230
They never figured out how to ride.

3968
01:37:41.231 --> 01:37:41.441
I know,

3969
01:37:41.441 --> 01:37:43.240
but the media is so fucking dumb.

3970
01:37:43.241 --> 01:37:45.760
They glom all over these people for no,

3971
01:37:45.790 --> 01:37:48.400
they really get on their nuts and they just let the talented people,

3972
01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:49.030
you know,

3973
01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:50.140
just stay in the line.

3974
01:37:50.141 --> 01:37:50.974
Wait your turn.

3975
01:37:51.250 --> 01:37:53.440
We're working on this right now cause it's about to expire.

3976
01:37:53.770 --> 01:37:53.921
Yeah,

3977
01:37:53.921 --> 01:37:54.611
but you know why?

3978
01:37:54.611 --> 01:37:55.890
Because will follow it

3979
01:37:56.490 --> 01:37:57.270
<v 7>even though you're like,</v>

3980
01:37:57.270 --> 01:37:58.530
even though they're annoyed,

3981
01:37:58.770 --> 01:38:02.060
there's something about those reality shows that people will tune in.

3982
01:38:02.061 --> 01:38:03.240
In advertisers,

3983
01:38:03.570 --> 01:38:05.130
all they do is a numbers game.

3984
01:38:05.340 --> 01:38:06.660
They know that if you get,

3985
01:38:06.690 --> 01:38:07.523
you know,

3986
01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:09.960
x amount of people are watching some show,

3987
01:38:10.290 --> 01:38:11.310
you play a commercial,

3988
01:38:11.311 --> 01:38:14.970
it's going to be seen by x amount of people that are in the demographic you're

3989
01:38:14.971 --> 01:38:15.804
looking for.

3990
01:38:15.870 --> 01:38:16.621
If that's the case,

3991
01:38:16.621 --> 01:38:18.360
they're willing to do it and people,

3992
01:38:18.450 --> 01:38:19.380
for whatever reason,

3993
01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:20.520
they don't like them.

3994
01:38:20.730 --> 01:38:24.270
You see someone on TV that has a real person live in a real life saying a bunch

3995
01:38:24.271 --> 01:38:26.190
of stupid shit and you get drawn into it.

3996
01:38:26.191 --> 01:38:27.420
You want to find out where they're going.

3997
01:38:27.421 --> 01:38:28.650
You want to find out what they're doing.

3998
01:38:28.980 --> 01:38:31.860
And they were really smart and what they did because what they did is they

3999
01:38:31.861 --> 01:38:33.150
involve their whole family.

4000
01:38:33.220 --> 01:38:33.850
<v 4>Oh yeah.</v>

4001
01:38:33.850 --> 01:38:34.930
To make it seem wholesome.

4002
01:38:35.170 --> 01:38:35.411
Well,

4003
01:38:35.411 --> 01:38:36.550
I don't even know if it's that,

4004
01:38:36.551 --> 01:38:40.480
but it gives you a lot of different people to tune into where's one Hilton was

4005
01:38:40.481 --> 01:38:41.320
only about her.

4006
01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:42.760
She couldn't sustain that.

4007
01:38:42.980 --> 01:38:43.480
Right.

4008
01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:44.380
But I think when you,

4009
01:38:44.590 --> 01:38:46.090
when you involve the whole family,

4010
01:38:46.091 --> 01:38:46.800
it shows,

4011
01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:47.340
uh,

4012
01:38:47.340 --> 01:38:51.760
a wholesomeness that America likes and it takes your mind off the fact that her

4013
01:38:51.761 --> 01:38:52.330
whole,

4014
01:38:52.330 --> 01:38:55.510
or some of her whole was the reason that we're here in the first place.

4015
01:38:55.780 --> 01:38:56.613
The whole,

4016
01:38:57.100 --> 01:38:57.730
I get it.

4017
01:38:57.730 --> 01:38:59.170
The whole sun and some hole.

4018
01:38:59.590 --> 01:39:00.423
You're welcome guys.

4019
01:39:00.430 --> 01:39:01.420
I'll be back next week.

4020
01:39:01.540 --> 01:39:01.661
Oh,

4021
01:39:01.661 --> 01:39:05.160
that's him watching it on a man that's fucking Washington,

4022
01:39:05.530 --> 01:39:06.363
Montana.

4023
01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:10.510
What's most shocking about that video is how much different she looked.

4024
01:39:10.930 --> 01:39:11.680
Yeah.

4025
01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:12.311
How much shit is,

4026
01:39:12.311 --> 01:39:13.780
shit isn't as big.

4027
01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:17.560
I rewatched it recently just because I wanted to know if her bub was,

4028
01:39:17.561 --> 01:39:19.030
I don't remember [inaudible] being that big.

4029
01:39:19.031 --> 01:39:20.560
It's half the size it used to be.

4030
01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:21.400
Yeah,

4031
01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:23.860
it's way bigger than it used to be.

4032
01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:24.520
Yeah.

4033
01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:24.830
We,

4034
01:39:24.830 --> 01:39:25.900
we'd better bigger now,

4035
01:39:25.901 --> 01:39:27.400
but it looked great back then.

4036
01:39:27.580 --> 01:39:29.500
Her body looked tremendous when it was natural.

4037
01:39:29.501 --> 01:39:29.741
I mean,

4038
01:39:29.741 --> 01:39:30.880
it was a beautiful body.

4039
01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:32.470
I doing all that shit to it.

4040
01:39:32.471 --> 01:39:33.001
It's just like it's,

4041
01:39:33.001 --> 01:39:34.480
it wasn't even really important.

4042
01:39:35.140 --> 01:39:35.550
Yeah.

4043
01:39:35.550 --> 01:39:36.520
Are you texting her right now?

4044
01:39:36.580 --> 01:39:37.810
I'm texting my nanny.

4045
01:39:38.110 --> 01:39:39.640
She asked me if I'm coming to see my daughter.

4046
01:39:40.270 --> 01:39:40.690
Oh,

4047
01:39:40.690 --> 01:39:41.590
well that's a little personal.

4048
01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:42.490
Sorry Mike.

4049
01:39:42.490 --> 01:39:43.930
I want to tell the whole Internet that.

4050
01:39:44.860 --> 01:39:45.693
There you go.

4051
01:39:45.700 --> 01:39:46.360
Yeah,

4052
01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:47.193
that's a,

4053
01:39:47.530 --> 01:39:51.190
it's a crazy thing to be able to just get famous by being a person,

4054
01:39:51.360 --> 01:39:52.480
like not a Sanger,

4055
01:39:52.540 --> 01:39:53.373
not an actor.

4056
01:39:53.390 --> 01:39:55.420
That's just never been a time like that in history.

4057
01:39:55.780 --> 01:39:57.040
If you start thinking about it though,

4058
01:39:57.041 --> 01:39:58.240
you can go back and go,

4059
01:39:58.241 --> 01:39:58.660
well,

4060
01:39:58.660 --> 01:40:00.080
you think back to the 70s and you went,

4061
01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:00.551
wait a minute,

4062
01:40:00.551 --> 01:40:01.810
why was so and so famous?

4063
01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:02.951
Paul Lynde,

4064
01:40:02.951 --> 01:40:04.030
why was he famous?

4065
01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:05.070
Who's a comedian was,

4066
01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:05.351
he know,

4067
01:40:05.351 --> 01:40:05.771
but could you,

4068
01:40:05.771 --> 01:40:07.480
could you ever quote a Paul Lynde Joe?

4069
01:40:07.680 --> 01:40:08.513
<v 7>No.</v>

4070
01:40:08.730 --> 01:40:08.971
No,

4071
01:40:08.971 --> 01:40:11.270
but he was on the Hollywood squares.

4072
01:40:11.270 --> 01:40:11.630
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

4073
01:40:11.630 --> 01:40:12.051
But then,

4074
01:40:12.051 --> 01:40:13.340
I mean like how did he get there?

4075
01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:13.851
Do you know what I mean?

4076
01:40:13.851 --> 01:40:14.150
It was,

4077
01:40:14.150 --> 01:40:18.350
did some movies and stuff before Paul Lynn's IMD B,

4078
01:40:18.770 --> 01:40:20.090
find out how you spell his last name.

4079
01:40:20.150 --> 01:40:21.350
L.

4080
01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:21.350
Y.

4081
01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:21.350
N.

4082
01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:21.710
D.

4083
01:40:21.710 --> 01:40:23.030
I was a big Hollywood squares.

4084
01:40:23.090 --> 01:40:24.740
He was one of those gay guys where you weren't,

4085
01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:25.970
they never said he was gay,

4086
01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:26.833
but everybody was.

4087
01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:27.410
Even,

4088
01:40:27.410 --> 01:40:27.981
even as a kid,

4089
01:40:27.981 --> 01:40:28.550
I was like,

4090
01:40:28.550 --> 01:40:29.390
something's wrong with that guy.

4091
01:40:30.710 --> 01:40:31.790
Oh God.

4092
01:40:31.791 --> 01:40:33.320
Even Jack Benny I thought was gay.

4093
01:40:33.410 --> 01:40:34.580
You know what Jack Benny gangs,

4094
01:40:34.610 --> 01:40:34.890
I don't know,

4095
01:40:34.890 --> 01:40:35.780
just seem gay to me.

4096
01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:36.320
Uh,

4097
01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:37.590
with the hand on the face.

4098
01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:40.010
The crazy one was rock Hudson,

4099
01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:42.860
rock rock.

4100
01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:44.270
You know who I'm friends with his,

4101
01:40:44.271 --> 01:40:45.104
uh,

4102
01:40:45.380 --> 01:40:46.213
uh,

4103
01:40:46.780 --> 01:40:48.670
we're just Semans no friends,

4104
01:40:48.900 --> 01:40:50.890
no close second,

4105
01:40:51.250 --> 01:40:52.430
his name is escaping me now.

4106
01:40:52.480 --> 01:40:52.840
Hold it.

4107
01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:53.500
Look,

4108
01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:54.860
he's in an old actor.

4109
01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:55.391
A tough guy.

4110
01:40:55.391 --> 01:40:55.811
Guy.

4111
01:40:55.811 --> 01:40:56.644
Uh,

4112
01:40:56.770 --> 01:40:57.603
Charles Bronson.

4113
01:40:57.800 --> 01:41:00.160
He's dead cheese.

4114
01:41:00.220 --> 01:41:02.830
Charlton Heston does he dead too?

4115
01:41:03.220 --> 01:41:04.150
Robert Conrad.

4116
01:41:04.470 --> 01:41:05.430
Robert Con man.

4117
01:41:05.570 --> 01:41:05.830
Yeah.

4118
01:41:05.830 --> 01:41:06.610
Really?

4119
01:41:06.610 --> 01:41:07.443
Yeah.

4120
01:41:07.690 --> 01:41:11.200
Who was a oh and he is so funny because he tells me stuff from back in those

4121
01:41:11.201 --> 01:41:11.621
times.

4122
01:41:11.621 --> 01:41:12.940
That's really blows my mind.

4123
01:41:13.750 --> 01:41:13.901
Oh,

4124
01:41:13.901 --> 01:41:14.051
well,

4125
01:41:14.051 --> 01:41:14.171
like,

4126
01:41:14.171 --> 01:41:14.400

okay.

4128
01:41:14.681 --> 01:41:15.091
You kept it.

4129
01:41:15.091 --> 01:41:16.060
Can't talk about it on the show.

4130
01:41:16.061 --> 01:41:16.630
Kenya.

4131
01:41:16.630 --> 01:41:16.961
I don't know.

4132
01:41:16.961 --> 01:41:17.510
Can I?

4133
01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:17.821
I don't know.

4134
01:41:17.821 --> 01:41:18.530
I don't you tell me.

4135
01:41:18.530 --> 01:41:18.830
Did,

4136
01:41:18.830 --> 01:41:19.720
I mean everybody talked,

4137
01:41:19.721 --> 01:41:20.710
told me about his dad.

4138
01:41:20.740 --> 01:41:21.573
Does that count?

4139
01:41:22.570 --> 01:41:22.771
Well,

4140
01:41:22.771 --> 01:41:24.900
it depends who's just tell me like Amina,

4141

01:41:27.311 --> 01:41:27.630

4143
01:41:27.630 --> 01:41:28.463
who was fucking hell.

4144
01:41:28.530 --> 01:41:29.090
Yeah.

4145
01:41:29.090 --> 01:41:29.923
Can I see?

4146
01:41:30.060 --> 01:41:30.610
You know,

4147
01:41:30.610 --> 01:41:31.610
can't say yeah.

4148
01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:32.340
Yeah.

4149
01:41:32.340 --> 01:41:32.610
I don't know.

4150
01:41:32.610 --> 01:41:32.921
Like he,

4151
01:41:32.921 --> 01:41:33.071
you know,

4152
01:41:33.071 --> 01:41:35.770
he called me back Natalie Wood and stuff like that.

4153
01:41:36.130 --> 01:41:36.820
Like I was like,

4154
01:41:36.820 --> 01:41:36.941
well,

4155
01:41:36.941 --> 01:41:37.780
so one of our rock Hudson,

4156
01:41:37.781 --> 01:41:37.991
cause yeah,

4157
01:41:37.991 --> 01:41:40.090
I knew rock and everybody knew he was gay back then.

4158
01:41:40.570 --> 01:41:41.403
Whoa.

4159
01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:41.741
I was like,

4160
01:41:41.741 --> 01:41:42.310
really?

4161
01:41:42.310 --> 01:41:42.491
He goes,

4162
01:41:42.491 --> 01:41:42.731
yeah,

4163
01:41:42.731 --> 01:41:44.020
he would just go off and do what he had to do.

4164
01:41:45.310 --> 01:41:46.600
Just do what he had to do.

4165
01:41:46.601 --> 01:41:47.434
Like a werewolf,

4166
01:41:48.430 --> 01:41:50.350
like a coyote stealing a chicken in the night,

4167
01:41:50.890 --> 01:41:52.730
just go out there and just attack the village.

4168
01:41:52.750 --> 01:41:53.583
Right.

4169
01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:55.980
Yeah.

4170
01:41:55.980 --> 01:41:56.320
Said,

4171
01:41:56.320 --> 01:41:59.510
then the Hollywood's been very accustomed to the whole gay thing for a long

4172
01:41:59.511 --> 01:42:00.050
time.

4173
01:42:00.050 --> 01:42:00.201
Well,

4174
01:42:00.201 --> 01:42:00.980
it had to be,

4175
01:42:00.980 --> 01:42:02.840
I mean it all came from theater.

4176
01:42:02.950 --> 01:42:04.180
Theater is filled with gay people.

4177
01:42:04.190 --> 01:42:04.400
Yeah.

4178
01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:05.330
There's no getting around that.

4179
01:42:05.660 --> 01:42:06.470
You know,

4180
01:42:06.470 --> 01:42:07.010
if you're,

4181
01:42:07.010 --> 01:42:08.750
if you're a homophobe but can you were in the theater.

4182
01:42:08.890 --> 01:42:10.490
It can't be homophobic and be in the business.

4183
01:42:10.540 --> 01:42:10.680
Know.

4184
01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:12.740
It's like being a Muslim and working for a pork factory.

4185
01:42:12.870 --> 01:42:13.690
Yup.

4186
01:42:13.690 --> 01:42:14.810
You've got some problems.

4187
01:42:16.310 --> 01:42:17.143
The business.

4188
01:42:17.450 --> 01:42:17.721
All right.

4189
01:42:17.721 --> 01:42:18.560
This podcast is over.

4190
01:42:19.400 --> 01:42:20.900
Can I never let you only can we just took it down.

4191
01:42:20.901 --> 01:42:22.030
Shit street then my bag.

4192
01:42:22.150 --> 01:42:22.760
I can't,

4193
01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:25.490
can't stop thinking about black cock holding and stuff like that.

4194
01:42:25.970 --> 01:42:26.250
Why?

4195
01:42:26.250 --> 01:42:27.080
Why Black Cock?

4196
01:42:27.080 --> 01:42:29.260
Holden's more populated in regular calc holding I think.

4197
01:42:29.300 --> 01:42:29.711
Oh,

4198
01:42:29.711 --> 01:42:30.081
you know,

4199
01:42:30.081 --> 01:42:30.914
because of Warren.

4200
01:42:30.930 --> 01:42:31.640
Yeah.

4201
01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:33.320
So that is willing as well.

4202
01:42:33.530 --> 01:42:35.870
But that is what that guy did like by watching.

4203
01:42:35.870 --> 01:42:36.040
Yeah.

4204
01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:36.351
Bang.

4205
01:42:36.351 --> 01:42:36.771
His girl.

4206
01:42:36.771 --> 01:42:37.571
That's cook holding ground.

4207
01:42:37.571 --> 01:42:37.650
Yeah,

4208
01:42:37.650 --> 01:42:39.710
but aren't you supposed to taunt them if you're a cook holding?

4209
01:42:39.890 --> 01:42:40.723
I believe so.

4210
01:42:40.790 --> 01:42:41.361
You should be like you.

4211
01:42:41.361 --> 01:42:42.030
Worm.

4212
01:42:42.030 --> 01:42:42.470
Yeah.

4213
01:42:42.470 --> 01:42:43.303
Piece of shit.

4214
01:42:43.550 --> 01:42:44.690
Fucking your bitch.

4215
01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:44.931
Yeah.

4216
01:42:44.931 --> 01:42:45.111
See,

4217
01:42:45.111 --> 01:42:46.040
I never did any of that.

4218
01:42:46.041 --> 01:42:46.874
I never,

4219
01:42:47.330 --> 01:42:48.141
I was joking with you.

4220
01:42:48.141 --> 01:42:49.040
Does prime,

4221
01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:49.731
I was more like,

4222
01:42:49.731 --> 01:42:50.270
hey man,

4223
01:42:50.270 --> 01:42:51.530
I'm fucking keeping my eye on you.

4224
01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:52.390
Can,

4225
01:42:52.390 --> 01:42:52.760
you know,

4226
01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:54.320
did you look at him in the eyes when you came?

4227
01:42:55.410 --> 01:42:56.243
No.

4228
01:42:56.800 --> 01:42:57.860
Load it.

4229
01:42:58.840 --> 01:42:59.191
Oh yeah.

4230
01:42:59.191 --> 01:43:00.140
She move that peg.

4231
01:43:00.230 --> 01:43:01.700
Oh good Lord.

4232
01:43:01.730 --> 01:43:03.520
I bet in the south black cock holdings,

4233
01:43:03.800 --> 01:43:06.500
way more popular than any other part of it.

4234
01:43:07.010 --> 01:43:08.350
It's far more wrong over there.

4235
01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:08.840
Well,

4236
01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:11.210
I used to have that bit about the statistic,

4237
01:43:11.211 --> 01:43:14.990
about the disproportionate amount of black of interracial porn being sold in the

4238
01:43:14.991 --> 01:43:17.060
deep south and then saw white people buying that shit.

4239
01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:18.350
White racist,

4240
01:43:18.350 --> 01:43:19.580
most slightly getting angry.

4241
01:43:20.570 --> 01:43:25.570
There's a like some like really like statistically significant number of more

4242
01:43:27.141 --> 01:43:28.100
interracial porn.

4243
01:43:28.101 --> 01:43:29.000
It's sold in deep south.

4244
01:43:30.010 --> 01:43:31.520
It sounds about right.

4245
01:43:31.740 --> 01:43:32.630
That does sound about right.

4246
01:43:34.040 --> 01:43:34.910
And we'll be right back.

4247
01:43:35.890 --> 01:43:38.090
You do come back.

4248
01:43:38.091 --> 01:43:38.924
We're all fucking game,

4249
01:43:40.400 --> 01:43:41.630
but nobody's looking at each other.

4250
01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:44.120
How much I international,

4251
01:43:44.121 --> 01:43:44.540

01:43:44.540 --> 01:43:45.710

4253
01:43:45.830 --> 01:43:46.200
Uh,

4254
01:43:46.200 --> 01:43:46.971

4255
01:43:46.971 --> 01:43:47.780
January bunny.

4256
01:43:47.780 --> 01:43:48.170
Yeah.

4257

4258
01:43:48.710 --> 01:43:49.010

Do you like you and those international tourists?

4268
01:43:58.520 --> 01:43:58.701
No.

4269
01:43:58.701 --> 01:43:59.151
Do you do,

4270
01:43:59.151 --> 01:44:01.490
I'm like months at a time or did you do a month at a time?

01:44:10.230 --> 01:44:11.063
I know Greg.

4283
01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:12.103
Hilarious.

4284
01:44:12.110 --> 01:44:12.680

01:44:17.630 --> 01:44:18.441

4290
01:44:18.441 --> 01:44:18.710

4291
01:44:18.710 --> 01:44:19.640

4294
01:44:22.340 --> 01:44:23.690
that is a march.

4295
01:44:24.170 --> 01:44:25.660
Ian Edwards is a funny motherfucker.

4296
01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:25.881
You know,

4297
01:44:25.881 --> 01:44:27.110
I've known Ian 20 years.

4298
01:44:27.590 --> 01:44:30.210
We used to do a England together back in [inaudible] 95 weeks.

4299
01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:32.210
That's when we first met when he had the long dreads.

4300
01:44:33.020 --> 01:44:33.231
Yeah,

4301
01:44:33.231 --> 01:44:34.250
I met him even before that.

4302
01:44:34.430 --> 01:44:35.630
I met him in the early nineties,

4303
01:44:35.631 --> 01:44:37.250
like [inaudible] 91 or something like that.

4304
01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:39.350
Working at the Boston Comedy Club.

4305
01:44:39.630 --> 01:44:40.241
That's in the village.

4306
01:44:40.241 --> 01:44:40.581
Everybody.

4307
01:44:40.581 --> 01:44:41.190
Yeah.

4308
01:44:41.190 --> 01:44:41.961
That's a good dude.

4309
01:44:41.961 --> 01:44:44.690
He's one of the funniest comics and he's fucking great.

4310
01:44:44.750 --> 01:44:45.440
He's so funny.

4311
01:44:45.440 --> 01:44:46.520
He's so underrated.

4312
01:44:47.300 --> 01:44:49.370
You don't want people talking about like the best comic in the country.

4313
01:44:49.371 --> 01:44:50.360
He doesn't get put on that list.

4314
01:44:50.540 --> 01:44:51.680
He's on my short list.

4315
01:44:52.160 --> 01:44:53.880
One of the top five funniest guys in the country.

4316
01:44:53.910 --> 01:44:54.001
Yeah,

4317
01:44:54.001 --> 01:44:54.471
he's really,

4318
01:44:54.471 --> 01:44:54.771
really,

4319
01:44:54.771 --> 01:44:55.790
really brilliant.

4320
01:44:55.850 --> 01:44:56.360
Yeah,

4321
01:44:56.360 --> 01:44:57.193
he's fucking,

4322
01:44:57.410 --> 01:44:59.480
he was killing it the other night at the store.

4323
01:44:59.510 --> 01:44:59.900
Mike.

4324
01:44:59.900 --> 01:45:00.381
God,

4325
01:45:00.381 --> 01:45:01.250
I had a tweet about it.

4326
01:45:01.251 --> 01:45:01.611
It was just,

4327
01:45:01.611 --> 01:45:02.031
it was just,

4328
01:45:02.031 --> 01:45:03.050
it was just smashing it.

4329
01:45:03.530 --> 01:45:05.270
He's got some new bits about Ferguson,

4330
01:45:05.271 --> 01:45:06.104
about the riots.

4331
01:45:06.170 --> 01:45:07.003
Oh,

4332
01:45:07.250 --> 01:45:08.270
it's hilarious.

4333
01:45:08.420 --> 01:45:09.800
When you do comedy in Hong Kong,

4334
01:45:09.801 --> 01:45:11.630
are you mostly doing it to like soldiers then?

4335
01:45:12.140 --> 01:45:12.980
I don't ever do that.

4336
01:45:13.150 --> 01:45:14.240
Don't never do those.

4337
01:45:14.600 --> 01:45:15.800
It's always was for the locals.

4338
01:45:16.250 --> 01:45:17.240
Whenever I see somebody like,

4339
01:45:17.241 --> 01:45:17.451
Hey,

4340
01:45:17.451 --> 01:45:21.010
I'm in Qatar performing and then they're like on these military vehicles,

4341
01:45:21.011 --> 01:45:21.151
like go,

4342
01:45:21.151 --> 01:45:22.340
you're not in Qatar performing.

4343
01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:22.900
You're not,

4344
01:45:22.900 --> 01:45:23.733
you're not doing shit.

4345
01:45:24.370 --> 01:45:26.750
You might as well be in America performing because you're not performing for the

4346
01:45:26.751 --> 01:45:27.584
local people.

4347
01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:29.120
That's not world touring.

4348
01:45:29.870 --> 01:45:30.830
Can they understand you?

4349
01:45:30.831 --> 01:45:31.071
I mean,

4350
01:45:31.071 --> 01:45:34.370
do you have to change your whole world speaks English ignoramus?

4351
01:45:35.100 --> 01:45:35.780
Well,

4352
01:45:35.780 --> 01:45:36.620
I mean like reference.

4353
01:45:36.650 --> 01:45:37.580
I would say that winning.

4354
01:45:37.590 --> 01:45:37.880
Nope.

4355
01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:38.390
No,

4356
01:45:38.390 --> 01:45:38.681
nope.

4357
01:45:38.681 --> 01:45:38.991
Buddy.

4358
01:45:38.991 --> 01:45:39.950
We live in a very,

4359
01:45:39.951 --> 01:45:40.784
um,

4360
01:45:41.150 --> 01:45:42.170
Americanized world.

4361
01:45:42.980 --> 01:45:43.161
Well,

4362
01:45:43.161 --> 01:45:45.530
especially now with the Internet,

4363
01:45:46.050 --> 01:45:46.700
everybody,

4364
01:45:46.700 --> 01:45:47.240
there isn't,

4365
01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:48.073
there is a,

4366
01:45:48.450 --> 01:45:51.740
I always say there's like a level of understanding for the whole world and it's

4367
01:45:51.741 --> 01:45:55.220
America and then anything above or below that is a,

4368
01:45:55.580 --> 01:45:58.880
is whatever you are from and then you just take it to the middle and everybody

4369
01:45:58.881 --> 01:45:59.714
meets their,

4370
01:46:00.170 --> 01:46:00.591
yeah.

4371
01:46:00.591 --> 01:46:03.770
Like sometimes when people go to other countries,

4372
01:46:03.771 --> 01:46:04.011
I see.

4373
01:46:04.011 --> 01:46:05.990
You have to adjust some of your references.

4374
01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:06.291
Yeah,

4375
01:46:06.291 --> 01:46:07.130
maybe a little bit,

4376
01:46:07.131 --> 01:46:07.731
but you know,

4377
01:46:07.731 --> 01:46:08.564
you can,

4378
01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:11.180
you can get away with most of them for the most part.

4379
01:46:11.210 --> 01:46:11.511
I mean,

4380
01:46:11.511 --> 01:46:12.344
if you're going to do like a,

4381
01:46:12.390 --> 01:46:13.700
it can't go to like,

4382
01:46:13.701 --> 01:46:14.260
uh,

4383
01:46:14.260 --> 01:46:14.510
uh,

4384
01:46:14.510 --> 01:46:14.861
Australia,

4385
01:46:14.861 --> 01:46:15.181
Australian,

4386
01:46:15.181 --> 01:46:16.130
but like you're killing me,

4387
01:46:16.131 --> 01:46:17.420
La Ira thinking I'm like,

4388
01:46:17.480 --> 01:46:18.590
the fuck are you talking about?

4389
01:46:21.230 --> 01:46:23.120
You're killing me,

4390
01:46:23.121 --> 01:46:23.954
Larry.

4391
01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:25.130
I remember that.

4392
01:46:25.131 --> 01:46:25.460
Every,

4393
01:46:25.460 --> 01:46:30.140
every town has one of those crazy electronics guys are crazy mattress Canada.

4394
01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:31.940
Toronto has a bad boy.

4395
01:46:31.941 --> 01:46:32.630
Electronics.

4396
01:46:32.630 --> 01:46:34.460
No Buddy.

4397
01:46:35.900 --> 01:46:37.070
Nobody beats our prices.

4398
01:46:37.130 --> 01:46:38.810
No Buddy.

4399
01:46:39.190 --> 01:46:40.190
Did you ever hear Crazy Eddie?

4400
01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:40.910
Uh,

4401
01:46:40.910 --> 01:46:41.091
no.

4402
01:46:41.091 --> 01:46:43.310
We have crazy Joe's drapery in Toronto.

4403
01:46:44.930 --> 01:46:46.340
There was a guy named crazy Eddie,

4404
01:46:46.341 --> 01:46:47.930
and he had crazy Eddie's electronics.

4405
01:46:47.931 --> 01:46:49.980
His prices are insane.

4406
01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:51.840
There was honest ed in Toronto.

4407
01:46:51.870 --> 01:46:53.240
He wound up going to jail though.

4408
01:46:53.260 --> 01:46:54.960
He did something that was fucking crazy.

4409
01:46:55.320 --> 01:46:55.501
Yeah.

4410
01:46:55.501 --> 01:46:58.220
But he did something really like tax evasion or something.

4411
01:46:58.710 --> 01:46:59.281
It was crazy.

4412
01:46:59.281 --> 01:47:02.380
Eddie can expect normal behavior from a guy named crazy heavy.

4413
01:47:03.170 --> 01:47:05.070
But that's really who he was.

4414
01:47:05.410 --> 01:47:06.280
<v 7>It's really who we want.</v>

4415
01:47:06.281 --> 01:47:06.591
So you really,

4416
01:47:06.591 --> 01:47:07.424
it was crazy.

4417
01:47:07.650 --> 01:47:08.483
It's out there living it.

4418
01:47:09.370 --> 01:47:10.203
Fucking Eddie.

4419
01:47:10.910 --> 01:47:13.410
<v 6>We had this guy named Reichard Ford in Columbus,</v>

4420
01:47:13.411 --> 01:47:13.711
Ohio.

4421
01:47:13.711 --> 01:47:15.120
And he has like pick from yeah.

4422
01:47:15.150 --> 01:47:18.090
And hence the largest dealership in the United States supposedly.

4423
01:47:18.091 --> 01:47:18.421
And he,

4424
01:47:18.421 --> 01:47:18.931
his thing was like,

4425
01:47:18.931 --> 01:47:19.680
we're dealing,

4426
01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:19.891
you know,

4427
01:47:19.891 --> 01:47:20.724
that's his thing.

4428
01:47:20.850 --> 01:47:22.980
But he got pulled over supposedly,

4429
01:47:22.981 --> 01:47:23.970
he got pulled over.

4430
01:47:24.180 --> 01:47:26.250
I with a hooker and cocaine,

4431
01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:27.113
tons of cocaine.

4432
01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:31.020
And so he made a deal with the Columbus police,

4433
01:47:31.210 --> 01:47:31.860
uh,

4434
01:47:31.860 --> 01:47:34.500
keep the saw on the DL and I'm raid,

4435
01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:38.490
donate my Lamborghini to deep the dare program.

4436
01:47:38.700 --> 01:47:39.090
So he,

4437
01:47:39.090 --> 01:47:43.230
there's this brand new Lamborghini and the Columbus Police Department that has

4438
01:47:43.231 --> 01:47:44.610
dare written all over it.

4439
01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:48.450
And supposedly that was the deal he made with to keep it on the DL.

4440
01:47:48.710 --> 01:47:50.900
<v 7>That doesn't make sense that you know about that.</v>

4441
01:47:52.060 --> 01:47:54.090
<v 6>I had family in the police department.</v>

4442
01:47:54.630 --> 01:47:56.550
<v 7>That seems like one of those fucking stories.</v>

4443
01:47:56.670 --> 01:47:57.060
<v 6>Yeah,</v>

4444
01:47:57.060 --> 01:47:57.481
it does,

4445
01:47:57.481 --> 01:48:00.060
but if you look at the,

4446
01:48:00.061 --> 01:48:01.410
if you go to the police department,

4447
01:48:01.411 --> 01:48:02.101
it's really odd.

4448
01:48:02.101 --> 01:48:05.000
They have like this really expensive Lamborghini and then

4449
01:48:05.110 --> 01:48:05.943
<v 4>no budget,</v>

4450
01:48:06.110 --> 01:48:06.600
no budget,

4451
01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:11.600
no cams and Riker gave it to him like he's a guy cooked up one night and set up

4452
01:48:11.821 --> 01:48:12.131
loving them.

4453
01:48:12.131 --> 01:48:12.761
Love you guys.

4454
01:48:12.761 --> 01:48:13.594
Keep it,

4455
01:48:13.810 --> 01:48:14.171
keep it.

4456
01:48:14.171 --> 01:48:14.950
Put the air on it.

4457
01:48:14.950 --> 01:48:16.630
My one Tyson tried to give away his Bentley,

4458
01:48:16.810 --> 01:48:17.381
so the carbs.

4459
01:48:17.381 --> 01:48:17.800
Yeah.

4460
01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:18.041
Yeah.

4461
01:48:18.041 --> 01:48:20.190
He crashed it and he tried to give it to the cop and the cop took it.

4462
01:48:20.230 --> 01:48:21.610
Then had to return it two days later.

4463
01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:23.030
I think they lost their job too.

4464
01:48:23.660 --> 01:48:24.410
<v 7>I think they were like,</v>

4465
01:48:24.410 --> 01:48:24.681
listen,

4466
01:48:24.681 --> 01:48:29.450
bitch can be taken fucking Bentley convertibles convertible to a very nice car.

4467
01:48:29.720 --> 01:48:30.350
Yeah.

4468
01:48:30.350 --> 01:48:31.183
For Mike Tyson.

4469
01:48:31.610 --> 01:48:32.040
Yeah.

4470
01:48:32.040 --> 01:48:32.990
Mike's a really sweet guy.

4471
01:48:32.991 --> 01:48:33.824
You know Mike don't yet.

4472
01:48:33.950 --> 01:48:35.000
He's a very sweet guy.

4473
01:48:35.060 --> 01:48:36.170
Surprisingly sweet.

4474
01:48:36.171 --> 01:48:36.741
When you meet them,

4475
01:48:36.741 --> 01:48:37.040
it's like,

4476
01:48:37.040 --> 01:48:37.520
wow,

4477
01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:37.821
he's a,

4478
01:48:37.821 --> 01:48:38.810
he's a really nice guy.

4479
01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:39.830
He's a fucking gentleman.

4480
01:48:39.990 --> 01:48:40.500
He's,

4481
01:48:40.500 --> 01:48:40.701
well,

4482
01:48:40.701 --> 01:48:41.900
he's just gone through.

4483
01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:43.460
Everybody wants,

4484
01:48:43.970 --> 01:48:44.241
you know,

4485
01:48:44.241 --> 01:48:46.310
you look back on like a video,

4486
01:48:46.311 --> 01:48:46.850
especially [inaudible]

4487
01:48:46.850 --> 01:48:48.490
<v 4>Tyson is fucking trash.</v>

4488
01:48:50.810 --> 01:48:50.931
Oh,

4489
01:48:50.931 --> 01:48:52.340
so this was a long time ago.

4490
01:48:52.860 --> 01:48:56.880
<v 6>Eighties and I mean it just felt really odd when he was doing it right</v>

4491
01:48:56.900 --> 01:48:59.030
<v 4>because he gave the guy on the left with the suit.</v>

4492
01:48:59.090 --> 01:49:00.470
Now the guy with the guitar,

4493
01:49:01.070 --> 01:49:04.310
with the car dealer because he was like,

4494
01:49:04.311 --> 01:49:07.310
we're dealing and so he's the one that got busted.

4495
01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:08.300
He's the one that got busted

4496
01:49:08.300 --> 01:49:10.700
<v 6>and I think this was like the chief of police,</v>

4497
01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:12.370
<v 7>but he's got his foot on the car,</v>

4498
01:49:12.371 --> 01:49:13.970
like an asshole particular foot off the car.

4499
01:49:14.550 --> 01:49:15.530
I think it's on the bumper.

4500
01:49:15.620 --> 01:49:16.700
It's a smash bumper.

4501
01:49:16.820 --> 01:49:18.290
Is that one of those smashed bumpers?

4502
01:49:18.470 --> 01:49:19.011
It's hard to tell.

4503
01:49:19.011 --> 01:49:20.720
It's so low resolution to smash them up.

4504
01:49:20.721 --> 01:49:21.290
Derby car,

4505
01:49:21.290 --> 01:49:21.981
by the way,

4506
01:49:21.981 --> 01:49:22.431
I should,

4507
01:49:22.431 --> 01:49:22.790
uh,

4508
01:49:22.790 --> 01:49:23.570
let you guys know.

4509
01:49:23.570 --> 01:49:23.961
We'll be,

4510
01:49:23.961 --> 01:49:26.300
we'll be going HD very soon.

4511
01:49:26.330 --> 01:49:28.880
Apparently we have all the equipment coming in and a,

4512
01:49:28.881 --> 01:49:31.700
we will be using a tri caster and everything will be HD.

4513
01:49:31.701 --> 01:49:35.450
So all you people complaining about getting Grainy Shit on your,

4514
01:49:35.451 --> 01:49:36.140
uh,

4515
01:49:36.140 --> 01:49:37.810
on your television when you go full screen with it.

4516
01:49:37.860 --> 01:49:39.920
There'll be very different starting next week.

4517
01:49:40.160 --> 01:49:43.190
But we have to figure out what to do as far as like storing the videos and

4518
01:49:43.191 --> 01:49:47.120
uploading the videos cause there'll be much larger files.

4519
01:49:47.500 --> 01:49:47.980
So we're going to have

4520
01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:49.800
<v 2>to get some Chai and hard drives and shit here.</v>

4521
01:49:49.940 --> 01:49:50.773
It's a good shit.

4522
01:49:50.980 --> 01:49:51.251
Yeah.

4523
01:49:51.251 --> 01:49:52.540
So I'm on one of your last,

4524
01:49:52.541 --> 01:49:53.350
uh,

4525
01:49:53.350 --> 01:49:54.320
h irregular.

4526
01:49:54.670 --> 01:49:57.400
You can come back and come back in a couple of weeks fellow anytime you want.

4527
01:49:57.550 --> 01:49:57.851
I mean,

4528
01:49:57.851 --> 01:49:58.150
buddy,

4529
01:49:58.150 --> 01:49:58.540
listen,

4530
01:49:58.540 --> 01:49:58.751
you know,

4531
01:49:58.751 --> 01:49:59.240
I love you.

4532
01:49:59.240 --> 01:49:59.760
I'm like,

4533
01:49:59.760 --> 01:49:59.951
you know,

4534
01:49:59.951 --> 01:50:00.251
it's funny.

4535
01:50:00.251 --> 01:50:03.180
I think the last time I was here I pissed off all your viewers with how did you

4536
01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:06.610
that Emory had mix master Mike on and everybody was mad at me for talking over

4537
01:50:06.611 --> 01:50:07.390
him.

4538
01:50:07.390 --> 01:50:07.811
Oh,

4539
01:50:07.811 --> 01:50:08.710
well that's just,

4540
01:50:09.300 --> 01:50:11.080
you got to realize if you're,

4541
01:50:11.500 --> 01:50:13.360
if you've got a podcast that have,

4542
01:50:13.930 --> 01:50:14.521
at that time,

4543
01:50:14.521 --> 01:50:17.140
it's probably a half a million people listening.

4544
01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:18.530
You're going to get complaints,

4545
01:50:18.980 --> 01:50:20.500
whether they're rational or not.

4546
01:50:20.810 --> 01:50:23.050
Tell Russell or shut the fuck up and let Mike Talk.

4547
01:50:23.770 --> 01:50:24.191
And I'm like,

4548
01:50:24.191 --> 01:50:27.910
I was only saying things for him because I know as a Dj he can't say certain

4549
01:50:27.911 --> 01:50:28.750
things politically.

4550
01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:30.010
So I would say it for him.

4551
01:50:30.011 --> 01:50:30.461
You know what I mean?

4552
01:50:30.461 --> 01:50:32.320
And all the Djs love me for that because they're like,

4553
01:50:32.620 --> 01:50:34.180
you can say it because you're a comedian.

4554
01:50:34.181 --> 01:50:36.040
We can't say it because we're in the same fucking business,

4555
01:50:36.260 --> 01:50:38.740
like criticisms of electronic music and stuff like that.

4556
01:50:39.100 --> 01:50:40.240
You're just talking,

4557
01:50:40.241 --> 01:50:40.511
man,

4558
01:50:40.511 --> 01:50:41.860
you're on the podcast to talk.

4559
01:50:41.861 --> 01:50:42.730
You're not on the podcast.

4560
01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:44.740
Just so Mike talks and I think,

4561
01:50:44.741 --> 01:50:44.950
you know,

4562
01:50:44.950 --> 01:50:46.450
the good thing is we're on the other side of that now.

4563
01:50:46.451 --> 01:50:47.620
So things are good as gone.

4564
01:50:47.950 --> 01:50:48.783
He's gone through.

4565
01:50:49.180 --> 01:50:49.870
It's past,

4566
01:50:49.870 --> 01:50:54.870
it's past the idea that you know like anyone can comment on,

4567
01:50:55.540 --> 01:50:59.740
you know like if you do a comedy show or if you do a podcast or even a movie,

4568
01:50:59.950 --> 01:51:01.990
I mean anyone can comment on that now.

4569
01:51:02.080 --> 01:51:06.790
So like I've had guests on that I loved and like what a great guy.

4570
01:51:06.940 --> 01:51:10.420
And then I go to my message board or I go to Twitter and like that goes a

4571
01:51:10.421 --> 01:51:11.254
fucking idiot.

4572
01:51:11.260 --> 01:51:12.093
Like what?

4573
01:51:12.180 --> 01:51:14.440
Like be like more than one like three,

4574
01:51:14.441 --> 01:51:17.140
four people will go look I was talking about of his ass.

4575
01:51:17.380 --> 01:51:19.360
I guess your bullshit detector doesn't work so good.

4576
01:51:19.361 --> 01:51:19.781
I'm like why?

4577
01:51:19.781 --> 01:51:21.270
It's like that guy was great.

4578
01:51:21.470 --> 01:51:25.030
Like I want to be on where you have Neil degrasse Tyson on again.

4579
01:51:25.390 --> 01:51:26.800
I just want to sit here and watch.

4580
01:51:26.860 --> 01:51:28.390
It was almost here a couple months ago.

4581
01:51:28.391 --> 01:51:30.370
I was fascinated by that time for some other stuff.

4582
01:51:30.371 --> 01:51:33.640
But the day he was doing it I was fucking out of town.

4583
01:51:33.641 --> 01:51:37.450
I was even thinking of maybe flying in just to do it with him and flying back to

4584
01:51:37.451 --> 01:51:38.410
where I was with my family.

4585
01:51:38.411 --> 01:51:40.430
But that would cause Aki,

4586
01:51:40.530 --> 01:51:41.363
man.

4587
01:51:42.110 --> 01:51:46.150
And you've got to avoid those if you want to stay in your wife's name is pretty

4588
01:51:46.151 --> 01:51:46.920
even keel.

4589
01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:49.600
So she's such a nice person.

4590
01:51:49.870 --> 01:51:52.300
If she has extra released when you eat one of her chickens,

4591
01:51:52.301 --> 01:51:55.420
she beat the shit out of my dog dog.

4592
01:51:55.960 --> 01:51:57.580
I never seen her so fucking angry.

4593
01:51:57.680 --> 01:51:58.870
She's coming to Vegas.

4594
01:51:59.170 --> 01:52:00.003
No,

4595
01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:00.641
not only that,

4596
01:52:00.641 --> 01:52:03.280
the dog didn't totally kill a chicken.

4597
01:52:08.350 --> 01:52:09.183
No

4598
01:52:11.110 --> 01:52:11.650
rough.

4599
01:52:11.650 --> 01:52:11.771
Yeah,

4600
01:52:11.771 --> 01:52:12.850
the truck is on chicken.

4601
01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:13.713
It was,

4602
01:52:14.860 --> 01:52:15.581
how dare you,

4603
01:52:15.581 --> 01:52:16.450
you break its neck.

4604
01:52:17.240 --> 01:52:18.340
It was badly,

4605
01:52:18.400 --> 01:52:19.540
badly injured.

4606
01:52:19.960 --> 01:52:22.120
Only had a small amount of time left.

4607
01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:24.130
It was imminent death.

4608
01:52:24.430 --> 01:52:25.720
Like I looked at the wound and I was like,

4609
01:52:25.750 --> 01:52:26.583
oh Christ,

4610
01:52:26.830 --> 01:52:29.560
this is not something you could like patch up with a bandaid and it's just,

4611
01:52:30.040 --> 01:52:31.930
it's a bucking 140 pound dog,

4612
01:52:32.380 --> 01:52:32.641
you know,

4613
01:52:32.641 --> 01:52:34.630
a bid into this little tiny chicken,

4614
01:52:34.631 --> 01:52:35.464
whatever it weighs.

4615
01:52:35.590 --> 01:52:36.160
Wow.

4616
01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:37.390
You're sent to more of a man than me.

4617
01:52:37.391 --> 01:52:38.200
Cause if I had that,

4618
01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:38.651
I wouldn't,

4619
01:52:38.651 --> 01:52:40.270
couldn't be like break its neck.

4620
01:52:40.271 --> 01:52:43.180
I'd be like put a trashcan over it and like go on a vacation for two weeks.

4621
01:52:46.610 --> 01:52:46.791
<v 4>Hey,</v>

4622
01:52:46.791 --> 01:52:48.050
maybe if this coyote is really smart,

4623
01:52:48.051 --> 01:52:49.640
they'll figure out there's a chicken into the trashcan.

4624
01:52:50.290 --> 01:52:50.501
<v 7>Well,</v>

4625
01:52:50.501 --> 01:52:51.670
I mean I certainly did.

4626
01:52:51.671 --> 01:52:52.750
Where'd you dispose of it then?

4627
01:52:53.590 --> 01:52:54.423
Buried it.

4628
01:52:54.580 --> 01:52:56.890
I certainly didn't want to do it.

4629
01:52:57.070 --> 01:52:57.321
You know,

4630
01:52:57.321 --> 01:52:59.260
I'd way rather the chicken live.

4631
01:52:59.320 --> 01:52:59.770
These ticks.

4632
01:52:59.770 --> 01:53:01.720
It's very weird because I eat chicken still.

4633
01:53:02.020 --> 01:53:02.410
It's a very,

4634
01:53:02.410 --> 01:53:03.640
it's a very strange relationship.

4635
01:53:03.910 --> 01:53:04.900
Like I eat chicken,

4636
01:53:04.901 --> 01:53:08.590
I go to Kentucky Fried Chicken or church's chicken or whatever the fuck I'll

4637
01:53:08.591 --> 01:53:09.424
have chicken.

4638
01:53:09.760 --> 01:53:12.580
But I have these chickens that are my pets too.

4639
01:53:12.581 --> 01:53:13.960
Like I really genuinely loved them.

4640
01:53:13.961 --> 01:53:14.794
They're sweet.

4641
01:53:14.890 --> 01:53:15.611
It's a weird thing.

4642
01:53:15.611 --> 01:53:16.840
And their eggs are delicious.

4643
01:53:17.140 --> 01:53:17.680
My,

4644
01:53:17.680 --> 01:53:18.051
yeah,

4645
01:53:18.051 --> 01:53:18.851
I gotta get you some,

4646
01:53:18.851 --> 01:53:19.690
at least some of these,

4647
01:53:19.691 --> 01:53:20.040
they're,

4648
01:53:20.040 --> 01:53:20.873
they're like,

4649
01:53:21.340 --> 01:53:24.670
they won't be the same right now because they're not free ranging cause until I

4650
01:53:24.671 --> 01:53:25.670
get rid of this coyotes,

4651
01:53:25.690 --> 01:53:26.740
I can't have him wander around the,

4652
01:53:26.741 --> 01:53:28.900
there was a coyote in front of my fence again today.

4653
01:53:29.230 --> 01:53:30.040
Like in the daytime?

4654
01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:30.550
Yes.

4655
01:53:30.550 --> 01:53:33.280
During the days when they were going in because that's when the chickens are

4656
01:53:33.281 --> 01:53:34.010
out.

4657
01:53:34.010 --> 01:53:34.391
He like,

4658
01:53:34.391 --> 01:53:36.340
that's when we'd let the chickens wander around.

4659
01:53:36.850 --> 01:53:37.121
But,

4660
01:53:37.121 --> 01:53:37.870
um,

4661
01:53:37.870 --> 01:53:41.320
they have this like dark orange yolk.

4662
01:53:41.530 --> 01:53:41.831
Yes.

4663
01:53:41.831 --> 01:53:45.610
It's so much darker and more vibrant than the Yolk you get from those

4664
01:53:45.780 --> 01:53:47.090
<v 4>and call those third world eggs.</v>

4665
01:53:47.091 --> 01:53:48.410
Cause when you go to other countries,

4666
01:53:48.500 --> 01:53:48.920
uh,

4667
01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:49.401
that's what the,

4668
01:53:49.401 --> 01:53:50.390
that's what eggs look like.

4669
01:53:50.420 --> 01:53:51.440
That's what they're supposed to look like.

4670
01:53:51.441 --> 01:53:51.740
Yeah.

4671
01:53:51.740 --> 01:53:52.820
They're not processed.

4672
01:53:52.821 --> 01:53:53.870
It's a whole fucking,

4673
01:53:54.020 --> 01:53:54.920
it's just the food that you,

4674
01:53:54.940 --> 01:53:57.040
<v 7>you give them because when we give him chicken feed,</v>

4675
01:53:57.070 --> 01:53:59.200
then there yolks become very light.

4676
01:53:59.230 --> 01:54:01.280
If like they stay inside their chicken house.

4677
01:54:01.300 --> 01:54:02.440
They have a big chicken house.

4678
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:05.740
Like if they stay inside the big chicken house and just eat the feed,

4679
01:54:05.920 --> 01:54:08.350
then they're yolks get to like a yellowish color.

4680
01:54:08.590 --> 01:54:09.940
The yolks we recognize.

4681
01:54:10.330 --> 01:54:10.930
Yes.

4682
01:54:10.930 --> 01:54:11.171
Yeah,

4683
01:54:11.171 --> 01:54:11.671
like the yolks.

4684
01:54:11.671 --> 01:54:12.504
Are you getting a store?

4685
01:54:12.910 --> 01:54:17.110
There's a place though a near my house and I was like legit free range chicken

4686
01:54:17.111 --> 01:54:19.070
eggs that they serve in the restaurant and you get the age,

4687
01:54:19.071 --> 01:54:19.301
she's like,

4688
01:54:19.301 --> 01:54:19.571
whoa,

4689
01:54:19.571 --> 01:54:20.530
these are dark eggs.

4690
01:54:20.830 --> 01:54:20.951
Like,

4691
01:54:20.951 --> 01:54:22.300
I recognize that stuff now,

4692
01:54:22.990 --> 01:54:26.560
but it's like the difference we were talking before about wild pork and like

4693
01:54:26.561 --> 01:54:27.394
domestic pork,

4694
01:54:27.480 --> 01:54:30.790
like a lot of the food that we eat is like so nutrient vacant,

4695
01:54:31.050 --> 01:54:31.271
you know,

4696
01:54:31.271 --> 01:54:35.020
there's not like way less than you would get if it was like the real wild

4697
01:54:35.021 --> 01:54:35.800
version of that.

4698
01:54:35.800 --> 01:54:37.660
What's the deal with the brown shell and the white shell?

4699
01:54:38.410 --> 01:54:39.243
That's a good question.

4700
01:54:39.590 --> 01:54:39.880
Um,

4701
01:54:39.880 --> 01:54:41.140
I'm white shells bleached.

4702
01:54:41.190 --> 01:54:41.620
No,

4703
01:54:41.620 --> 01:54:41.870
no,

4704
01:54:41.870 --> 01:54:42.051
no,

4705
01:54:42.051 --> 01:54:42.370
no.

4706
01:54:42.370 --> 01:54:45.880
Some chickens just lay white shells and some chickens lay green ones.

4707
01:54:45.881 --> 01:54:47.410
We have ones like green eggs.

4708
01:54:47.440 --> 01:54:48.770
They're close to the Irish chickens.

4709
01:54:51.110 --> 01:54:52.540
Not I'd make an egg on,

4710
01:54:52.610 --> 01:54:54.190
not the um,

4711
01:54:54.250 --> 01:54:54.481
eat the,

4712
01:54:54.481 --> 01:54:54.970
call them Easter.

4713
01:54:54.970 --> 01:54:56.890
Eggers like some of them are dark,

4714
01:54:56.891 --> 01:54:59.890
like a dark chocolate and some of them are like a light brown is what we get.

4715
01:54:59.891 --> 01:55:01.600
A bunch of different color eggs.

4716
01:55:01.710 --> 01:55:01.940
Yes.

4717
01:55:01.940 --> 01:55:02.773
Weird

4718
01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:04.610
Penis.

4719
01:55:04.610 --> 01:55:05.860
I hook you up with a thousand a day.

4720
01:55:05.870 --> 01:55:06.180
Right.

4721
01:55:06.180 --> 01:55:06.391
You know,

4722
01:55:06.391 --> 01:55:09.580
I'm a closer to you now to come on over the hill fella.

4723
01:55:09.810 --> 01:55:10.081
Yeah,

4724
01:55:10.081 --> 01:55:10.650
I'm right there.

4725
01:55:10.650 --> 01:55:10.831
Don't,

4726
01:55:10.831 --> 01:55:12.070
don't get eaten up by the waves.

4727
01:55:12.230 --> 01:55:12.450
He,

4728
01:55:12.450 --> 01:55:13.550
he's just bring the eggs here.

4729
01:55:13.570 --> 01:55:14.230
We a microwave.

4730
01:55:14.230 --> 01:55:14.970
And make sandwich.

4731
01:55:14.970 --> 01:55:16.590
<v 4>Microwave you son of a bitch.</v>

4732
01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:18.200
We got good fucking eggs.

4733
01:55:18.220 --> 01:55:19.360
You want a microwave up?

4734
01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:20.070
There's no,

4735
01:55:20.070 --> 01:55:21.660
you don't know from this.

4736
01:55:22.020 --> 01:55:24.600
Do you think microwaving is bad for the food?

4737
01:55:24.960 --> 01:55:25.350
Is it,

4738
01:55:25.350 --> 01:55:27.740
does it do anything to the food that's different than cooking?

4739
01:55:27.750 --> 01:55:28.680
It just takes the taste.

4740
01:55:29.000 --> 01:55:29.833
It tastes,

4741
01:55:30.390 --> 01:55:32.100
I think you're taking away if you're,

4742
01:55:32.340 --> 01:55:35.220
I think you're wasting perfectly good food.

4743
01:55:35.560 --> 01:55:37.230
Like if you're eating the right food,

4744
01:55:37.231 --> 01:55:37.861
the type of stuff,

4745
01:55:37.861 --> 01:55:38.281
your reading,

4746
01:55:38.281 --> 01:55:39.630
the eggs and the meat.

4747
01:55:39.660 --> 01:55:40.740
You don't want to nuke that.

4748
01:55:41.310 --> 01:55:44.010
You want to nuke the shit that's already got the chemicals and shit

4749
01:55:44.010 --> 01:55:44.843
<v 6>in it.</v>

4750
01:55:44.910 --> 01:55:45.180
You know?

4751
01:55:45.180 --> 01:55:47.100
Hopefully the radiation will kill those chemicals.

4752
01:55:47.160 --> 01:55:50.400
It's way better if you just instinct like if you want to reheat a sandwich,

4753
01:55:50.401 --> 01:55:51.210
like a roommate,

4754
01:55:51.210 --> 01:55:54.580
it's way better just to throw it on the skillet then it is to microwave it.

4755
01:55:55.040 --> 01:55:55.873
Yeah.

4756
01:55:56.850 --> 01:55:58.250
Well it takes out all the nutrients.

4757
01:55:58.470 --> 01:56:01.830
It kills the nutrients and the taste and everything and yeah,

4758
01:56:02.440 --> 01:56:03.340
<v 7>let's snope that.</v>

4759
01:56:03.400 --> 01:56:03.791
Let's see,

4760
01:56:03.791 --> 01:56:04.101
cause I,

4761
01:56:04.101 --> 01:56:04.350
I,

4762
01:56:04.350 --> 01:56:07.470
I've always wanted to know because I've always heard people say that microwave

4763
01:56:07.471 --> 01:56:08.304
and kills the nutrients,

4764
01:56:08.470 --> 01:56:10.300
but I've never actually seen like any,

4765
01:56:10.540 --> 01:56:11.500
any studies.

4766
01:56:11.770 --> 01:56:12.700
So Russell,

4767
01:56:12.701 --> 01:56:13.534
what do you think?

4768
01:56:13.740 --> 01:56:17.750
<v 6>I think that the radiation has to do something negative to your food.</v>

4769
01:56:18.990 --> 01:56:19.700
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

4770
01:56:19.700 --> 01:56:22.440
<v 6>Isn't there a reason why I feel bad for you to put your face close to a</v>

4771
01:56:22.441 --> 01:56:22.971
microwave?

4772
01:56:22.971 --> 01:56:23.804
Isn't that crazy?

4773
01:56:23.890 --> 01:56:25.130
Is it good for you?

4774
01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:27.800
Maybe the government doesn't want you doing that shit cause you live forever.

4775
01:56:27.801 --> 01:56:30.980
My microwave is down on really low so I can't put my face

4776
01:56:31.570 --> 01:56:32.980
<v 7>[inaudible] Nah,</v>

4777
01:56:33.010 --> 01:56:35.260
microwaves and nutrition.

4778
01:56:35.410 --> 01:56:36.710
Let's see what they say to,

4779
01:56:36.730 --> 01:56:36.881
to,

4780
01:56:36.881 --> 01:56:37.030
to,

4781
01:56:37.030 --> 01:56:37.190
to,

4782
01:56:37.190 --> 01:56:41.020
to science based medicine as a concept that is larger than the analysis of any

4783
01:56:41.021 --> 01:56:41.831
specific topic.

4784
01:56:41.831 --> 01:56:46.180
Blom blom blom blom blom blom blom blom um,

4785
01:56:46.210 --> 01:56:46.481
okay.

4786
01:56:46.481 --> 01:56:47.470
Let's just way too big.

4787
01:56:47.530 --> 01:56:48.363
Here we go.

4788
01:56:48.850 --> 01:56:50.110
Does microwave the CNN,

4789
01:56:50.140 --> 01:56:52.840
does microwaving food remove its nutritional value?

4790
01:56:52.870 --> 01:56:56.470
Let's say the rumor zapping food in the microwave.

4791
01:56:57.190 --> 01:56:59.020
Leaches out key nutrients.

4792
01:56:59.021 --> 01:57:00.340
The verdict if you do it right.

4793
01:57:00.341 --> 01:57:04.390
Cooking food in the microwave is one of the best ways to retain your foods.

4794
01:57:04.391 --> 01:57:05.350
Vitamins and minerals.

4795
01:57:05.970 --> 01:57:06.803
Huh?

4796
01:57:07.030 --> 01:57:08.860
There are dangerous to microwaving your food.

4797
01:57:08.861 --> 01:57:13.720
You could get scalded for one if you use the wrong kind of plastic hint.

4798
01:57:13.721 --> 01:57:15.850
It's one that doesn't say microwave safe.

4799
01:57:15.880 --> 01:57:19.030
Unhealthy chemicals could seep into your food CFCs,

4800
01:57:19.060 --> 01:57:22.450
but if you're concerned about getting the most attrition out of your eads,

4801
01:57:22.451 --> 01:57:24.250
microwaving is a safe bet.

4802
01:57:24.251 --> 01:57:24.851
In fact,

4803
01:57:24.851 --> 01:57:29.290
it's near the top of the list for nutritionally sound food preparation methods.

4804
01:57:29.620 --> 01:57:33.700
If you use your microwave with a small amount of water to essentially steam food

4805
01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:34.900
from the inside,

4806
01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:39.490
you'll retain more vitamins and minerals than almost any other cooking method.

4807
01:57:39.650 --> 01:57:40.190
<v 6>Wow.</v>

4808
01:57:40.190 --> 01:57:42.690
That seems like it's written by Ge.

4809
01:57:45.340 --> 01:57:47.330
It's written by Bob Barnett.

4810
01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:51.000
Bob Barnett from CNN up wave dot.

4811
01:57:51.001 --> 01:57:51.150
Yeah,

4812
01:57:51.150 --> 01:57:51.481
<v 7>calm.</v>

4813
01:57:51.481 --> 01:57:52.380
I don't know what that means.

4814
01:57:52.400 --> 01:57:55.380
CNN up wave.com was make your mind up,

4815
01:57:55.381 --> 01:57:55.770
bitch.

4816
01:57:55.770 --> 01:57:57.120
What's one of those subsidiaries?

4817
01:57:57.650 --> 01:57:59.030
<v 6>The lesser known CNNS.</v>

4818
01:57:59.090 --> 01:57:59.361
<v 7>Yeah,</v>

4819
01:57:59.361 --> 01:58:04.190
and this picture they have a guy cooking peas in a microwave with a little bit

4820
01:58:04.191 --> 01:58:04.790
of water.

4821
01:58:04.790 --> 01:58:05.623
Hmm.

4822
01:58:05.900 --> 01:58:06.733
That's interesting.

4823
01:58:07.070 --> 01:58:08.540
Does microwaving cause cancer?

4824
01:58:08.930 --> 01:58:09.763
What do you think?

4825
01:58:10.370 --> 01:58:12.230
I think everything causes cancer at this point.

4826
01:58:12.260 --> 01:58:12.621
It says,

4827
01:58:12.621 --> 01:58:14.870
of course you can mess microwaving up.

4828
01:58:15.050 --> 01:58:18.800
Dump your veggies and a bunch of water and overcooked them and you leach out

4829
01:58:18.801 --> 01:58:21.260
plenty of nutrition when you cook food in the microwave,

4830
01:58:21.261 --> 01:58:25.310
cover it tightly creating an efficient steam environment.

4831
01:58:25.311 --> 01:58:28.100
Steven over a stove top is just as good though.

4832
01:58:28.370 --> 01:58:30.170
And some cases it may even be better.

4833
01:58:30.171 --> 01:58:34.110
One small study found that steamed Broccoli retained more of its cancer fighting

4834
01:58:34.800 --> 01:58:36.050
Sofo.

4835
01:58:36.350 --> 01:58:36.980
Wow.

4836
01:58:36.980 --> 01:58:40.190
So for a faint sulforaphane,

4837
01:58:41.290 --> 01:58:42.010
sulfur then

4838
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:43.030
<v 2>microwave Broccoli.</v>

4839
01:58:43.240 --> 01:58:44.020
Okay.

4840
01:58:44.020 --> 01:58:46.300
But in most cases using your microwave to cook food,

4841
01:58:46.330 --> 01:58:49.780
it's covered tightly into microwave safe container with a minimal amount of

4842
01:58:49.781 --> 01:58:50.170
liquid.

4843
01:58:50.170 --> 01:58:51.370
It's a nutritional when,

4844
01:58:51.840 --> 01:58:52.673
hey,

4845
01:58:52.690 --> 01:58:53.950
so not see that coming.

4846
01:58:53.980 --> 01:58:54.670
Yeah.

4847
01:58:54.670 --> 01:58:54.821
Yeah.

4848
01:58:54.821 --> 01:58:55.181
Because,

4849
01:58:55.181 --> 01:58:55.830
um,

4850
01:58:55.830 --> 01:58:56.400
my,

4851
01:58:56.400 --> 01:58:56.740
my,

4852
01:58:56.740 --> 01:59:00.280
my wife has a friend whose mom is like super crazy.

4853
01:59:00.310 --> 01:59:02.380
Like with everything has to be organic.

4854
01:59:02.381 --> 01:59:03.670
Everything has to be this,

4855
01:59:03.671 --> 01:59:06.460
everything has to be that she won't use microwave cause it,

4856
01:59:06.730 --> 01:59:08.020
it kills the nutrients.

4857
01:59:08.050 --> 01:59:08.511
And I was like,

4858
01:59:08.511 --> 01:59:08.710
whoa.

4859
01:59:08.710 --> 01:59:09.543
I go,

4860
01:59:10.030 --> 01:59:11.050
how do you know this?

4861
01:59:11.260 --> 01:59:11.711
And she's like,

4862
01:59:11.711 --> 01:59:11.861
well,

4863
01:59:11.861 --> 01:59:12.910
it's common sense.

4864
01:59:13.330 --> 01:59:13.661
And I'm like,

4865
01:59:13.661 --> 01:59:14.330
okay,

4866
01:59:14.330 --> 01:59:14.920
all right.

4867
01:59:14.920 --> 01:59:16.540
But I never checked into it till just now.

4868
01:59:17.140 --> 01:59:17.651
And now I'm like,

4869
01:59:17.651 --> 01:59:17.921
listen,

4870
01:59:17.921 --> 01:59:20.320
bitch is a thing called Google.

4871
01:59:20.440 --> 01:59:21.580
You need to get acquainted with it.

4872
01:59:22.450 --> 01:59:23.410
Living in that fucking,

4873
01:59:24.370 --> 01:59:25.420
those ancient times,

4874
01:59:25.810 --> 01:59:28.690
people were just passing down tales from generation to generation.

4875
01:59:28.730 --> 01:59:28.791
I,

4876
01:59:28.791 --> 01:59:28.960
yeah,

4877
01:59:28.960 --> 01:59:29.793
my mom does that.

4878
01:59:30.380 --> 01:59:30.520
Well,

4879
01:59:30.520 --> 01:59:32.170
especially when they first came out with microwaves.

4880
01:59:32.410 --> 01:59:33.131
Fuck number one,

4881
01:59:33.131 --> 01:59:34.330
it had a twist knob on it.

4882
01:59:34.390 --> 01:59:35.223
Oh yeah.

4883
01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:36.833
Yeah.

4884
01:59:36.910 --> 01:59:37.440
<v 6>What was that?</v>

4885
01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:38.170
What was that?

4886
01:59:38.170 --> 01:59:38.610
That was my,

4887
01:59:38.610 --> 01:59:39.443
my voice

4888
01:59:41.230 --> 01:59:42.063
was on cue.

4889
01:59:42.180 --> 01:59:42.380
No,

4890
01:59:42.380 --> 01:59:43.213
weird.

4891
01:59:43.890 --> 01:59:44.723
It's totally unclear.

4892
01:59:45.640 --> 01:59:45.840
Yeah.

4893
01:59:45.840 --> 01:59:47.100
So microwaving good Brian,

4894
01:59:47.460 --> 01:59:48.390
don't repeat that anymore.

4895
01:59:49.430 --> 01:59:53.550
That also was probably passed down from like a colored person told my mom or

4896
01:59:53.551 --> 01:59:54.380
something.

4897
01:59:54.380 --> 01:59:54.480
Oh,

4898
01:59:54.480 --> 01:59:55.320
colored person.

4899
01:59:56.710 --> 01:59:57.543
Well,

4900
01:59:57.960 --> 02:00:01.770
you deal with a lot of racial comedy to talk to this motherfucker.

4901
02:00:02.550 --> 02:00:04.200
Mine's from a more educated perspective.

4902
02:00:04.201 --> 02:00:04.591
I know.

4903
02:00:04.591 --> 02:00:04.921
It is.

4904
02:00:04.921 --> 02:00:06.190
That's why I'm asking you to talk to him.

4905
02:00:07.320 --> 02:00:09.960
Back in the day when a person of color,

4906
02:00:10.070 --> 02:00:12.190
person of color probably told my grandmother that.

4907
02:00:12.650 --> 02:00:13.880
<v 2>Isn't it funny that you,</v>

4908
02:00:13.940 --> 02:00:18.200
you can say person of color that is the politically correct way to stop colored

4909
02:00:18.410 --> 02:00:22.610
colored person is negative colored people is negative.

4910
02:00:22.611 --> 02:00:24.140
People of color is positive,

4911
02:00:24.200 --> 02:00:24.410
right?

4912
02:00:24.410 --> 02:00:26.090
Like we're just cause I think you're encompassing,

4913
02:00:26.091 --> 02:00:26.900
uh,

4914
02:00:26.900 --> 02:00:27.170
uh,

4915
02:00:27.170 --> 02:00:27.861
more people.

4916
02:00:27.861 --> 02:00:30.830
When you say people of color as a colored person?

4917
02:00:30.831 --> 02:00:32.660
I always suggest one type of color.

4918
02:00:33.290 --> 02:00:33.621
Yeah.

4919
02:00:33.621 --> 02:00:38.120
But I mean if it was look like a colored person did have no negative connotation

4920
02:00:38.121 --> 02:00:41.480
whatsoever and it was just like white people colored people.

4921
02:00:41.930 --> 02:00:46.070
Well I guess that's the other problem like colored people becomes like if you

4922
02:00:46.071 --> 02:00:47.570
say people of color,

4923
02:00:47.630 --> 02:00:51.770
you could have like a whole large group like from Sumatra,

4924
02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:52.910
from Puerto Rico,

4925
02:00:52.911 --> 02:00:53.270
from you.

4926
02:00:53.270 --> 02:00:54.650
You've got people from all over the place.

4927
02:00:55.070 --> 02:00:56.780
But if you say white people and then,

4928
02:00:56.781 --> 02:01:01.040
and then colored people like people on on his mat automatically seeing black.

4929
02:01:01.280 --> 02:01:01.491
Yeah.

4930
02:01:01.491 --> 02:01:02.660
Well people of color.

4931
02:01:02.840 --> 02:01:03.261
Why is that?

4932
02:01:03.261 --> 02:01:04.094
Okay.

4933
02:01:04.580 --> 02:01:09.580
I think person and people a separate singular and multiple pieces.

4934
02:01:10.260 --> 02:01:11.930
That one is so people of color,

4935
02:01:11.931 --> 02:01:16.460
like encompassing this wide range of different people and what colored person,

4936
02:01:16.970 --> 02:01:20.960
you narrow it down to one person and then it's basically which person do you

4937
02:01:20.961 --> 02:01:21.794
picture?

4938
02:01:22.940 --> 02:01:23.271
Yeah,

4939
02:01:23.271 --> 02:01:26.450
I guess I had a friend say colored people once.

4940
02:01:26.451 --> 02:01:29.420
We were like 16 or 17 or something like that at a diner.

4941
02:01:29.520 --> 02:01:30.760
And my dad used to say colored,

4942
02:01:30.780 --> 02:01:31.970
his grandmother said it.

4943
02:01:32.450 --> 02:01:34.160
My Dad just said coloureds and negroes.

4944
02:01:34.190 --> 02:01:36.800
But there was a guy who was the waiter who was a black guy.

4945
02:01:36.801 --> 02:01:37.011
He goes,

4946
02:01:37.011 --> 02:01:37.970
what color were they?

4947
02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:39.913
It's like,

4948
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:40.321
<v 4>you know,</v>

4949
02:01:40.321 --> 02:01:42.420
like some ignorant Boston kids,

4950
02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:47.440
like arc in South Africa to make the distinction.

4951
02:01:48.770 --> 02:01:49.190
Yeah.

4952
02:01:49.190 --> 02:01:49.580
What do they say?

4953
02:01:49.580 --> 02:01:50.200
How did he say it?

4954
02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:53.480
Their palate and the lips and collards and Cooley's.

4955
02:01:53.540 --> 02:01:54.470
Everybody's dead.

4956
02:01:54.760 --> 02:01:56.120
What's the Cooley Indians?

4957
02:01:56.480 --> 02:01:57.313
You're a cooling.

4958
02:01:57.410 --> 02:01:58.910
That's what they used to cut our negative.

4959
02:01:58.911 --> 02:02:02.120
A negative or derogatory term out there.

4960
02:02:02.121 --> 02:02:02.580
Cooley.

4961
02:02:02.580 --> 02:02:03.560
So India,

4962
02:02:03.561 --> 02:02:05.600
is that a very common thing for Africa,

4963
02:02:05.601 --> 02:02:06.710
for him to come over?

4964
02:02:06.890 --> 02:02:07.101
Well,

4965
02:02:07.101 --> 02:02:07.281
yeah.

4966
02:02:07.281 --> 02:02:09.140
Well it's South Africa was when they eating on,

4967
02:02:09.150 --> 02:02:10.340
we're taking slaves out.

4968
02:02:10.341 --> 02:02:11.630
They were replacing them with Indians.

4969
02:02:11.631 --> 02:02:13.580
It's Kinda like you're Benz breaks down to give you a Honda.

4970
02:02:13.850 --> 02:02:14.683
Really?

4971
02:02:14.810 --> 02:02:15.643
Yeah.

4972
02:02:16.160 --> 02:02:18.170
So we were there as an indentured laborers.

4973
02:02:18.590 --> 02:02:18.741
Oh.

4974
02:02:18.741 --> 02:02:21.290
So like you have a debt to work off basically.

4975
02:02:21.300 --> 02:02:24.320
And we were working in the sugar cane fields in Africa,

4976
02:02:24.500 --> 02:02:25.160
southern Africa.

4977
02:02:25.160 --> 02:02:28.190
So it was like the Dutch came to Africa first,

4978
02:02:28.191 --> 02:02:28.410
right?

4979
02:02:28.410 --> 02:02:29.780
It was that the colonists,

4980
02:02:30.630 --> 02:02:31.070
the big,

4981
02:02:31.070 --> 02:02:32.000
the big boars.

4982
02:02:32.630 --> 02:02:33.230
Yeah.

4983
02:02:33.230 --> 02:02:35.450
We didn't choose [inaudible] and they,

4984
02:02:35.451 --> 02:02:35.631
uh,

4985
02:02:35.631 --> 02:02:36.620
they were also in Sri Lanka.

4986
02:02:36.621 --> 02:02:37.160
Please.

4987
02:02:37.160 --> 02:02:37.790
How'd he say it?

4988
02:02:37.790 --> 02:02:39.800
Cooley's you learned in new racial slur

4989
02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:42.230
but it doesn't like it.

4990
02:02:42.231 --> 02:02:42.380
Yeah.

4991
02:02:42.380 --> 02:02:43.370
Unless you're South African,

4992
02:02:43.371 --> 02:02:44.540
it won't really mean much to you.

4993
02:02:44.541 --> 02:02:45.200
Right.

4994
02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:46.130
Does it work?

4995
02:02:46.860 --> 02:02:47.220
Indians?

4996
02:02:47.220 --> 02:02:48.140
Is that offensive?

4997
02:02:48.141 --> 02:02:51.050
Like if you were talking to an Indian and South Africa and he said,

4998
02:02:51.051 --> 02:02:51.910
what do you Cooley's up to?

4999
02:02:52.230 --> 02:02:52.611
Let's see.

5000
02:02:52.611 --> 02:02:54.200
I could say it and it would be fine.

5001
02:02:54.201 --> 02:02:55.010
They would laugh.

5002
02:02:55.010 --> 02:02:55.760
They probably,

5003
02:02:55.760 --> 02:02:57.230
the older ones would get a little upset.

5004
02:02:57.950 --> 02:02:58.430
Um,

5005
02:02:58.430 --> 02:02:59.900
but if a white person says that they're kind of like,

5006
02:02:59.901 --> 02:03:00.081
whoa,

5007
02:03:00.081 --> 02:03:00.261
Whoa,

5008
02:03:00.261 --> 02:03:00.421
Whoa,

5009
02:03:00.421 --> 02:03:00.740
whoa.

5010
02:03:00.740 --> 02:03:01.573
What the fuck are you doing?

5011
02:03:02.140 --> 02:03:02.410
What do you,

5012
02:03:02.410 --> 02:03:02.620
what do you,

5013
02:03:02.620 --> 02:03:03.110
what do you have anyone?

5014
02:03:03.110 --> 02:03:04.550
Even who you call him Cooley right now?

5015
02:03:04.750 --> 02:03:05.030
Yeah.

5016
02:03:05.030 --> 02:03:08.900
Those Inter Inter race expressions that only certain people,

5017
02:03:08.930 --> 02:03:10.100
white people don't have any of those.

5018
02:03:10.310 --> 02:03:14.600
He seen South Africa colored makes a lot of sense because there's black,

5019
02:03:14.601 --> 02:03:14.901
white,

5020
02:03:14.901 --> 02:03:19.160
Indian and colored over there and the colored people are basically a mix of

5021
02:03:19.430 --> 02:03:19.701
black,

5022
02:03:19.701 --> 02:03:20.534
white and Indian.

5023
02:03:20.610 --> 02:03:21.470
Is that what it is?

5024
02:03:21.500 --> 02:03:21.681
Yeah.

5025
02:03:21.681 --> 02:03:22.101
So they're like,

5026
02:03:22.101 --> 02:03:22.221
well,

5027
02:03:22.221 --> 02:03:22.761
they're colored.

5028
02:03:22.761 --> 02:03:23.391
These ones are black.

5029
02:03:23.391 --> 02:03:23.671
These ones,

5030
02:03:23.671 --> 02:03:24.940
they're Indian and those are white.

5031
02:03:24.941 --> 02:03:26.150
And those are the colored ones.

5032
02:03:26.420 --> 02:03:26.811
Oh,

5033
02:03:26.811 --> 02:03:28.040
so when they say colored,

5034
02:03:28.041 --> 02:03:29.600
they're their meaning of a mixed.

5035
02:03:29.660 --> 02:03:29.811
Yeah.

5036
02:03:29.811 --> 02:03:33.530
There's an actual race of people in South Africa called that are colored people.

5037
02:03:33.740 --> 02:03:34.220
Really?

5038
02:03:34.220 --> 02:03:35.053
Yeah.

5039
02:03:35.930 --> 02:03:37.750
That's fucking bizarre.

5040
02:03:37.760 --> 02:03:38.593
Months.

5041
02:03:39.050 --> 02:03:39.321
Yeah.

5042
02:03:39.321 --> 02:03:40.154
But they're very,

5043
02:03:40.160 --> 02:03:41.390
very good looking women.

5044
02:03:41.570 --> 02:03:41.931
Really,

5045
02:03:41.931 --> 02:03:42.780
really good looking with them.

5046
02:03:42.781 --> 02:03:43.614
Boom.

5047
02:03:44.250 --> 02:03:45.500
Get it mean systems.

5048
02:03:45.501 --> 02:03:46.334
I'm sure.

5049
02:03:48.800 --> 02:03:49.910
What is it like over there?

5050
02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:50.360
Sounds.

5051
02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:50.871
I love it,

5052
02:03:50.871 --> 02:03:51.420
dude.

5053
02:03:51.420 --> 02:03:52.460
It's a little aggressive,

5054
02:03:52.461 --> 02:03:52.850
isn't it?

5055
02:03:52.850 --> 02:03:53.450
No,

5056
02:03:53.450 --> 02:03:53.750
no,

5057
02:03:53.750 --> 02:03:54.830
I heard it's very dangerous.

5058
02:03:55.130 --> 02:03:55.880
That's what they say.

5059
02:03:55.880 --> 02:03:56.151
But I,

5060
02:03:56.151 --> 02:03:56.520
you know,

5061
02:03:56.520 --> 02:03:57.090
I mean,

5062
02:03:57.090 --> 02:03:57.380
you know,

5063
02:03:57.380 --> 02:03:58.370
it's not any more dangerous.

5064
02:03:58.760 --> 02:04:00.590
You get into trouble if you're going to get into trouble.

5065
02:04:00.770 --> 02:04:01.420
Right.

5066
02:04:01.420 --> 02:04:04.070
You know it very rarely do people get into trouble that aren't supposed to get

5067
02:04:04.071 --> 02:04:04.550
in trouble.

5068
02:04:04.550 --> 02:04:05.740
It's not more violent there.

5069
02:04:05.750 --> 02:04:06.380
Anything like that.

5070
02:04:06.380 --> 02:04:06.621
I mean,

5071
02:04:06.621 --> 02:04:07.060
it is a,

5072
02:04:07.060 --> 02:04:07.311
I mean,

5073
02:04:07.311 --> 02:04:07.650
it's not,

5074
02:04:07.650 --> 02:04:08.780
it's like going to the hood here.

5075
02:04:08.781 --> 02:04:09.471
You're going to get in trouble.

5076
02:04:09.471 --> 02:04:10.304
If you could go to the hood.

5077
02:04:10.370 --> 02:04:10.821
Oh,

5078
02:04:10.821 --> 02:04:11.900
I see he's staying here.

5079
02:04:11.940 --> 02:04:12.621
Stay in your lane.

5080
02:04:12.621 --> 02:04:13.454
You'll be fine.

5081
02:04:13.670 --> 02:04:17.360
So as long as you hang around with the right crowd in the right areas,

5082
02:04:17.580 --> 02:04:18.860
if you go to those areas,

5083
02:04:18.861 --> 02:04:20.750
you should probably be with people from those areas.

5084
02:04:21.170 --> 02:04:23.090
You shouldn't just wander in like an asshole.

5085
02:04:23.210 --> 02:04:24.200
What's it like doing shows?

5086
02:04:24.201 --> 02:04:25.190
They're great.

5087
02:04:25.580 --> 02:04:26.413
I love it over there.

5088
02:04:26.420 --> 02:04:28.220
Did you ever talk to them about searching for sugar?

5089
02:04:28.221 --> 02:04:28.990
Man?

5090
02:04:28.990 --> 02:04:29.360
No.

5091
02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:29.600
I,

5092
02:04:29.600 --> 02:04:31.010
this is my first time back after,

5093
02:04:31.011 --> 02:04:31.880
after seeing the film,

5094
02:04:31.881 --> 02:04:33.150
so I'm,

5095
02:04:33.190 --> 02:04:34.790
I'm curious to see what they want to know.

5096
02:04:35.220 --> 02:04:36.560
[inaudible] shit ever.

5097
02:04:36.590 --> 02:04:37.260
That was pretty,

5098
02:04:37.260 --> 02:04:37.650
wasn't it?

5099
02:04:37.650 --> 02:04:38.940
That movie was amazing.

5100
02:04:38.941 --> 02:04:40.110
Did you ever see searching for sugar?

5101
02:04:40.111 --> 02:04:40.430
Man?

5102
02:04:40.430 --> 02:04:41.160
Hmm.

5103
02:04:41.160 --> 02:04:42.150
I recommend it high.

5104
02:04:42.151 --> 02:04:42.381
You know,

5105
02:04:42.381 --> 02:04:43.214
it's really funny.

5106
02:04:43.740 --> 02:04:46.680
I knew one of the songs went really?

5107
02:04:46.710 --> 02:04:46.861
Yeah.

5108
02:04:46.861 --> 02:04:47.730
That song Sugarman,

5109
02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:49.600
you'd heard it when you were in South Africa?

5110
02:04:49.601 --> 02:04:49.741
No,

5111
02:04:49.741 --> 02:04:51.570
I'd heard it in a hip hop song.

5112
02:04:51.990 --> 02:04:52.823
Oh,

5113
02:04:53.820 --> 02:04:54.750
a long time ago,

5114
02:04:55.860 --> 02:04:56.693
man.

5115
02:04:56.850 --> 02:04:57.511
That's right.

5116
02:04:57.511 --> 02:04:58.380
He did.

5117
02:04:58.860 --> 02:05:00.030
Oh my God,

5118
02:05:00.031 --> 02:05:00.811
that's right.

5119
02:05:00.811 --> 02:05:02.160
What happened was that from,

5120
02:05:02.910 --> 02:05:05.270
I think it was the one with the golden feral face.

5121
02:05:05.290 --> 02:05:05.421
Yeah,

5122
02:05:05.421 --> 02:05:06.360
it was one of those ones.

5123
02:05:06.360 --> 02:05:08.580
It was like one of the late nineties albums.

5124
02:05:08.680 --> 02:05:10.340
Wow.

5125
02:05:10.380 --> 02:05:11.191
What song was it?

5126
02:05:11.191 --> 02:05:12.024
Do you know the song,

5127
02:05:12.060 --> 02:05:12.893
uh,

5128
02:05:13.230 --> 02:05:14.063
your demand?

5129
02:05:14.070 --> 02:05:15.480
You're the man.

5130
02:05:16.100 --> 02:05:16.490
Is that,

5131
02:05:16.490 --> 02:05:17.323
is that what it was?

5132
02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:18.353
What album was it?

5133
02:05:19.170 --> 02:05:20.550
I am still Madec.

5134
02:05:20.990 --> 02:05:22.420
Stillmatic she hasn't won.

5135
02:05:22.580 --> 02:05:22.830
Oh,

5136
02:05:22.830 --> 02:05:23.161
okay.

5137
02:05:23.161 --> 02:05:25.080
So that wasn't even that early.

5138
02:05:25.290 --> 02:05:28.010
It was illmatic was way earlier than nomadic.

5139
02:05:28.020 --> 02:05:28.801
And then it was a,

5140
02:05:28.801 --> 02:05:31.770
it was written than I am.

5141
02:05:31.771 --> 02:05:34.330
I think it was written was the one that,

5142
02:05:34.331 --> 02:05:34.530
uh,

5143
02:05:34.530 --> 02:05:35.940
welcome to the new world on it.

5144
02:05:36.810 --> 02:05:37.200
You're,

5145
02:05:37.200 --> 02:05:38.300
you ever heard that one too?

5146
02:05:38.430 --> 02:05:39.091
It was written.

5147
02:05:39.091 --> 02:05:39.550
Had A,

5148
02:05:39.550 --> 02:05:44.550
if I ruled the world and it had a shootouts and had some dre produced stuff on

5149
02:05:44.731 --> 02:05:44.940
it,

5150
02:05:44.940 --> 02:05:46.620
he might be the best lyricist ever.

5151
02:05:46.621 --> 02:05:47.130
Right.

5152
02:05:47.130 --> 02:05:50.190
He's the lot of a rapper's favorite rapper.

5153
02:05:50.430 --> 02:05:53.850
That shit that he did when he made that whole rap in reverse,

5154
02:05:54.600 --> 02:05:56.560
the rewind ramp it was in,

5155
02:05:56.561 --> 02:05:57.271
it was from,

5156
02:05:57.271 --> 02:05:57.690
uh,

5157
02:05:57.690 --> 02:05:58.680
one of the more recent ones,

5158
02:05:58.681 --> 02:06:00.360
like two or three cds ago.

5159
02:06:00.740 --> 02:06:01.573
He,

5160
02:06:02.070 --> 02:06:03.020
I forget what the name of the,

5161
02:06:03.021 --> 02:06:03.360
uh,

5162
02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:04.021
the song was,

5163
02:06:04.021 --> 02:06:04.854
but it was,

5164
02:06:05.280 --> 02:06:06.300
is it called rewind?

5165
02:06:06.350 --> 02:06:08.640
So he's done a lot of cool shit.

5166
02:06:08.790 --> 02:06:09.450
Yeah,

5167
02:06:09.450 --> 02:06:10.081
it's writing.

5168
02:06:10.081 --> 02:06:10.780
It's so good.

5169
02:06:10.780 --> 02:06:13.590
It's just obviously such a smart dude cause a very intelligent human being.

5170
02:06:13.591 --> 02:06:16.430
Did you see the documentary on him again?

5171
02:06:16.431 --> 02:06:20.280
If there's a documentary on illmatic really time is illmatic and it's,

5172
02:06:20.700 --> 02:06:25.500
he just breaks down the whole album over 20 years and I came together and it's

5173
02:06:25.501 --> 02:06:26.101
pretty cool.

5174
02:06:26.101 --> 02:06:26.934
Like you know there's an a,

5175
02:06:26.950 --> 02:06:30.870
there's a shot on the back of the album with him in the Queensbridge projects

5176
02:06:30.871 --> 02:06:31.470
with all the,

5177
02:06:31.470 --> 02:06:34.260
all the guys from the neighborhood and it goes through that guy's dead,

5178
02:06:34.261 --> 02:06:35.011
that guy's in jail.

5179
02:06:35.011 --> 02:06:37.230
This you what I mean like it's pretty cool.

5180
02:06:37.920 --> 02:06:42.300
Breaks down all the songs and how they got together and it's pretty fucking

5181
02:06:42.301 --> 02:06:43.134
cool.

5182
02:06:43.410 --> 02:06:44.040
It's on,

5183
02:06:44.040 --> 02:06:44.880
it's on showtime now,

5184
02:06:44.881 --> 02:06:45.350
I think.

5185
02:06:45.350 --> 02:06:46.141
Have you heard that song?

5186
02:06:46.141 --> 02:06:47.190
I'm in love with the Coco.

5187
02:06:47.640 --> 02:06:47.821
Yeah,

5188
02:06:47.821 --> 02:06:48.330
it's terrible.

5189
02:06:48.330 --> 02:06:48.901
It's horrible.

5190
02:06:48.901 --> 02:06:50.520
But it's already gone already.

5191
02:06:50.521 --> 02:06:51.280
Thank God.

5192
02:06:51.280 --> 02:06:53.510
But the guy got arrested for everything eat.

5193
02:06:53.820 --> 02:06:54.561
He raps about,

5194
02:06:54.561 --> 02:06:54.751
he's like,

5195
02:06:54.751 --> 02:06:54.991
he's like,

5196
02:06:54.991 --> 02:06:55.201
yeah,

5197
02:06:55.201 --> 02:06:58.590
I robbed somebody and got up and I sell cocaine and I do this instead.

5198
02:06:58.650 --> 02:06:59.490
The police came in and was like,

5199
02:06:59.491 --> 02:06:59.881
all right,

5200
02:06:59.881 --> 02:07:02.380
so if we get a few out and cocaine charges and they just arrested him,

5201
02:07:02.970 --> 02:07:04.530
you can erase Bobby Shmurda.

5202
02:07:04.531 --> 02:07:05.610
Just got arrested too.

5203
02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:06.660
Who's that?

5204
02:07:06.660 --> 02:07:09.510
Some fucking loser had the Schermer to dance.

5205
02:07:09.640 --> 02:07:14.640
Well we were just talking yesterday about some guy getting arrested for lyrics

5206
02:07:14.851 --> 02:07:18.330
in a rap song and they were trying to indict him on crimes like murder.

5207
02:07:18.720 --> 02:07:20.010
Which one was talking about that guy?

5208
02:07:20.400 --> 02:07:21.233
Bobby Shmurda.

5209
02:07:21.620 --> 02:07:23.250
And what's he getting indicted for?

5210
02:07:23.940 --> 02:07:28.940
Shmita spelled S.

5211
02:07:33.990 --> 02:07:33.990

A.

5229
02:07:33.990 --> 02:07:34.823
Schmurder arrested.

5230
02:07:35.860 --> 02:07:36.670
Yeah,

5231
02:07:36.670 --> 02:07:37.021
<v 2>Bobby.</v>

5232
02:07:37.021 --> 02:07:38.590
She attempted murder wrapper.

5233
02:07:39.070 --> 02:07:42.400
Spent Christmas in jail after arrest.

5234
02:07:42.670 --> 02:07:44.050
He had that song about a week ago.

5235
02:07:44.320 --> 02:07:46.750
Rested in drug trafficking scheme.

5236
02:07:47.920 --> 02:07:48.700
Sting.

5237
02:07:48.700 --> 02:07:50.110
So it was all good about a week ago.

5238
02:07:51.150 --> 02:07:51.280
Yeah.

5239
02:07:51.280 --> 02:07:53.110
I don't think this is the same story of this.

5240
02:07:53.111 --> 02:07:54.760
I think there's a different story.

5241
02:07:55.360 --> 02:07:55.780
Um,

5242
02:07:55.780 --> 02:07:56.620
there was one of them,

5243
02:07:56.621 --> 02:07:56.820
the,

5244
02:07:56.820 --> 02:07:58.630
this guy was getting arrested for,

5245
02:07:58.750 --> 02:07:59.140
uh,

5246
02:07:59.140 --> 02:08:00.670
lyrics just for lyrics.

5247
02:08:01.100 --> 02:08:02.680
[inaudible] is that it?

5248
02:08:03.190 --> 02:08:04.030
Probably the same one.

5249
02:08:04.760 --> 02:08:05.400
Is that it?

5250
02:08:05.400 --> 02:08:05.701
<v 6>Yeah,</v>

5251
02:08:05.701 --> 02:08:06.181
cause he was,

5252
02:08:06.181 --> 02:08:08.940
he pretty much just wrapped about what he got charged

5253
02:08:09.080 --> 02:08:09.913
<v 2>for,</v>

5254
02:08:10.280 --> 02:08:10.700
uh,

5255
02:08:10.700 --> 02:08:11.271
drugs.

5256
02:08:11.271 --> 02:08:12.104
Uh,

5257
02:08:12.110 --> 02:08:12.943
conspiracies.

5258
02:08:13.700 --> 02:08:15.020
Did you hear about Dmx?

5259
02:08:15.350 --> 02:08:16.183
What about them?

5260
02:08:16.230 --> 02:08:16.610
Uh,

5261
02:08:16.610 --> 02:08:21.540
apparently there was like a fake story that he had a bunch of dead pit bulls and

5262
02:08:21.541 --> 02:08:22.600
that he got arrested for it.

5263
02:08:22.960 --> 02:08:24.890
It was like a hoarding dead dogs.

5264
02:08:24.950 --> 02:08:25.370
Yeah.

5265
02:08:25.370 --> 02:08:27.530
But it was one of those fucking goofy debt.

5266
02:08:27.531 --> 02:08:29.450
Fake stories that keep people keep doing.

5267
02:08:29.510 --> 02:08:30.343
Yeah.

5268
02:08:30.890 --> 02:08:33.740
How weird is that that we live in this time where people can do that?

5269
02:08:33.770 --> 02:08:34.930
They just just

5270
02:08:35.400 --> 02:08:37.350
<v 7>barely come up.</v>

5271
02:08:37.351 --> 02:08:37.531
No.

5272
02:08:37.531 --> 02:08:38.970
See this is a different story.

5273
02:08:39.210 --> 02:08:39.931
The wrapper,

5274
02:08:39.931 --> 02:08:44.931
a rapper's lyrics result in arrest and eventual conviction as a different

5275
02:08:45.751 --> 02:08:46.584
gentleman,

5276
02:08:47.100 --> 02:08:47.933
uh,

5277
02:08:48.060 --> 02:08:48.691
Twain.

5278
02:08:48.691 --> 02:08:49.524
Gadi.

5279
02:08:50.850 --> 02:08:51.300
Yeah.

5280
02:08:51.300 --> 02:08:56.300
Please had been unable to solve the 2007 murder of Christopher Horton and Brian

5281
02:08:57.090 --> 02:08:58.170
Dean in Newport News,

5282
02:08:58.171 --> 02:09:02.130
Virginia Horton and Dean 16 and 20 were gunned down while sitting on the porch

5283
02:09:02.700 --> 02:09:04.680
in a town of 180,000 residents,

5284
02:09:04.681 --> 02:09:06.630
which suffered 28 murders that year.

5285
02:09:06.710 --> 02:09:07.320
Wow.

5286
02:09:07.320 --> 02:09:08.800
That's a lot of fucking murders or hunting.

5287
02:09:08.990 --> 02:09:09.541
80,000,

5288
02:09:09.541 --> 02:09:10.350
28 murders.

5289
02:09:10.350 --> 02:09:11.880
She 180,000 people.

5290
02:09:12.120 --> 02:09:12.901
Four years later,

5291
02:09:12.901 --> 02:09:13.591
detective can,

5292
02:09:13.591 --> 02:09:15.600
upon a video of a local rapper,

5293
02:09:16.530 --> 02:09:17.363
he had uh,

5294
02:09:17.490 --> 02:09:18.390
been tipped off,

5295
02:09:18.391 --> 02:09:18.571
blah,

5296
02:09:18.571 --> 02:09:18.691
blah,

5297
02:09:18.691 --> 02:09:19.080
blah.

5298
02:09:19.080 --> 02:09:21.150
That a song right out referred to the murders,

5299
02:09:21.151 --> 02:09:22.680
especially one verse which ran,

5300
02:09:22.710 --> 02:09:25.710
everybody saw when I fucking choked him,

5301
02:09:25.711 --> 02:09:28.260
but nobody saw when I fucking smoked him,

5302
02:09:28.560 --> 02:09:29.400
roped him,

5303
02:09:29.820 --> 02:09:32.520
sharpened up the shank and then poked him.

5304
02:09:32.521 --> 02:09:34.680
Three 57 Smith and Wesson.

5305
02:09:34.681 --> 02:09:35.470
Big scope.

5306
02:09:35.470 --> 02:09:36.780
Tim roped him.

5307
02:09:37.530 --> 02:09:38.110
Hmm.

5308
02:09:38.110 --> 02:09:40.660
<v 6>Shmurda in October they got the other guy said,</v>

5309
02:09:40.690 --> 02:09:45.160
my music is straight facts and he got a 69 count indictment that included

5310
02:09:45.161 --> 02:09:45.491
murder,

5311
02:09:45.491 --> 02:09:46.211
attempted murder,

5312
02:09:46.211 --> 02:09:47.050
dealing drugs,

5313
02:09:47.051 --> 02:09:47.411
weapons,

5314
02:09:47.411 --> 02:09:47.900
possessions,

5315
02:09:47.900 --> 02:09:48.000
that,

5316
02:09:48.000 --> 02:09:51.550
a list of other crimes in connection with a little long term investigation.

5317
02:09:51.870 --> 02:09:52.650
<v 2>Whoa.</v>

5318
02:09:52.650 --> 02:09:53.640
Because his lyrics,

5319
02:09:53.641 --> 02:09:55.080
his straight fast state facts.

5320
02:09:55.530 --> 02:09:55.770
Yeah.

5321
02:09:55.770 --> 02:09:57.030
He probably shouldn't have said that.

5322
02:09:59.770 --> 02:10:00.551
<v 7>There's another one.</v>

5323
02:10:00.551 --> 02:10:03.610
Could this rapper's lyrics wind him up in jail for life?

5324
02:10:03.611 --> 02:10:04.690
This is a recent one.

5325
02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:08.320
On November 17th this was a different guy,

5326
02:10:08.860 --> 02:10:13.860
a tiny do born Brandon Dunkin is facing attempted murder charges along with

5327
02:10:17.110 --> 02:10:19.390
other 14 other gang members.

5328
02:10:19.750 --> 02:10:22.240
The rapper himself hasn't been late to any shootings.

5329
02:10:22.660 --> 02:10:25.180
There are nine since April of last year that are being looked at.

5330
02:10:25.181 --> 02:10:25.990
If he doesn't have,

5331
02:10:25.990 --> 02:10:26.590
he doesn't have it.

5332
02:10:26.590 --> 02:10:28.030
He doesn't even have a criminal record,

5333
02:10:28.600 --> 02:10:29.620
but he could murder life.

5334
02:10:29.740 --> 02:10:30.573
Now this other guy,

5335
02:10:30.730 --> 02:10:31.563
tiny boo.

5336
02:10:31.570 --> 02:10:33.500
Oh tiny do Brandon Dunkin.

5337
02:10:33.710 --> 02:10:34.543
See there's,

5338
02:10:34.850 --> 02:10:38.090
I guess there's a bunch of these now doesn't have a criminal record but he could

5339
02:10:38.091 --> 02:10:41.990
be doing life behind bars based on a little used 14 year old law.

5340
02:10:42.020 --> 02:10:43.220
This is the story I was talking about.

5341
02:10:43.580 --> 02:10:47.630
The law as reported by ABC allows for the prosecution of gang members if they

5342
02:10:47.631 --> 02:10:50.870
benefit from crimes committed by other gang members.

5343
02:10:51.020 --> 02:10:55.970
So he is apparently down with his gang and because he's down with this gang

5344
02:10:56.000 --> 02:10:57.200
while they're doing crimes,

5345
02:10:57.590 --> 02:10:58.010
uh,

5346
02:10:58.010 --> 02:11:01.160
his affiliation being friends with them is enough.

5347
02:11:02.710 --> 02:11:03.300
<v 8>Okay.</v>

5348
02:11:03.300 --> 02:11:06.720
<v 6>Instagram never had that problem with third base.</v>

5349
02:11:06.750 --> 02:11:07.650
Remember those guys?

5350
02:11:07.780 --> 02:11:08.613
Yeah.

5351
02:11:08.710 --> 02:11:10.230
Know pop goes the weasel,

5352
02:11:10.231 --> 02:11:11.430
the weasel goes pop,

5353
02:11:11.730 --> 02:11:11.971
pop,

5354
02:11:11.971 --> 02:11:13.020
pop goes the weasel.

5355
02:11:13.021 --> 02:11:13.854
The weasel

5356
02:11:15.450 --> 02:11:17.280
for the prime minister.

5357
02:11:18.550 --> 02:11:18.731
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

5358
02:11:18.731 --> 02:11:19.564
They were very,

5359
02:11:19.990 --> 02:11:21.640
very angry at vanilla ice.

5360
02:11:22.230 --> 02:11:23.063
Yeah.

5361
02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:23.680
Remember that?

5362
02:11:23.680 --> 02:11:24.513
It's sorta like,

5363
02:11:24.760 --> 02:11:25.180
you know,

5364
02:11:25.180 --> 02:11:28.090
they mocked vanilla ice on the way to start him.

5365
02:11:30.320 --> 02:11:31.153
<v 8>Huh?</v>

5366
02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:33.120
<v 7>White rappers is a tough fucking business.</v>

5367
02:11:33.930 --> 02:11:37.140
M and m's been the only one that really successful successfully got through the

5368
02:11:37.141 --> 02:11:37.681
entire thing.

5369
02:11:37.681 --> 02:11:42.681
Unscaved like he's like super respected still as a rapper in 2014.

5370
02:11:43.770 --> 02:11:44.520
Who else?

5371
02:11:44.520 --> 02:11:45.353
Name another white guy.

5372
02:11:45.390 --> 02:11:46.200
Another white rapper.

5373
02:11:46.200 --> 02:11:46.441
Ready?

5374
02:11:46.441 --> 02:11:46.980
Go.

5375
02:11:46.980 --> 02:11:47.250
<v 8>Okay.</v>

5376
02:11:47.250 --> 02:11:48.083
<v 6>Milk bone.</v>

5377
02:11:48.380 --> 02:11:49.213
See Chris,

5378
02:11:50.400 --> 02:11:51.233

5379
02:11:52.300 --> 02:11:53.990
search and he's not anymore.

5380
02:11:54.880 --> 02:11:55.810
<v 7>Is it different things?</v>

5381
02:11:55.960 --> 02:11:56.500
There's a deal.

5382
02:11:56.500 --> 02:11:57.333
He's a different thing.

5383
02:11:57.730 --> 02:11:58.061
First of all,

5384
02:11:58.061 --> 02:12:00.040
he's doing rap only for white kids.

5385
02:12:00.700 --> 02:12:01.320
You know,

5386
02:12:01.320 --> 02:12:01.960
it's a different,

5387
02:12:01.960 --> 02:12:03.310
it's a different kind of music,

5388
02:12:03.400 --> 02:12:03.970
right?

5389
02:12:03.970 --> 02:12:07.030
Like m and M is like respected in the hip hop world.

5390
02:12:07.170 --> 02:12:08.140
Like across the board.

5391
02:12:08.141 --> 02:12:08.650
Right.

5392
02:12:08.650 --> 02:12:09.640
State your name and other one.

5393
02:12:09.970 --> 02:12:11.230
It cross color barriers.

5394
02:12:11.320 --> 02:12:11.740
Yeah.

5395
02:12:11.740 --> 02:12:13.660
I mean just was so good.

5396
02:12:13.930 --> 02:12:15.010
He was undeniable.

5397
02:12:18.810 --> 02:12:19.643
<v 8>What does that,</v>

5398
02:12:20.130 --> 02:12:20.821
<v 6>have you ever heard of it?</v>

5399
02:12:20.821 --> 02:12:22.050
What is black widow baby?

5400
02:12:22.051 --> 02:12:24.990
Why you sing the song by Iggy Azalea?

5401
02:12:25.400 --> 02:12:26.130
How do you know that?

5402
02:12:26.130 --> 02:12:26.963
Uh,

5403
02:12:27.030 --> 02:12:28.080
because I'm dating a Mexican,

5404
02:12:28.290 --> 02:12:30.900
but she supposedly,

5405
02:12:30.950 --> 02:12:34.530
my Mexican is telling me about how I'm Mexican was like,

5406
02:12:34.531 --> 02:12:39.150
you're talking about my assistant was Iggy Azalea is like a completely made up

5407
02:12:39.570 --> 02:12:41.580
like a corporate person.

5408
02:12:41.610 --> 02:12:42.180
Like,

5409
02:12:42.180 --> 02:12:43.290
she doesn't even know how to rap.

5410
02:12:43.590 --> 02:12:44.130
And,

5411
02:12:44.130 --> 02:12:44.371
uh,

5412
02:12:44.371 --> 02:12:45.950
it's just like she was,

5413
02:12:46.440 --> 02:12:50.220
I guess she's been in a lot of interviews lately where they've tried to tricker

5414
02:12:50.221 --> 02:12:51.031
and doing like a,

5415
02:12:51.031 --> 02:12:51.331
you know,

5416
02:12:51.331 --> 02:12:54.630
a freestyle freestyle rap and she freaks out cause you can't rap.

5417
02:12:55.020 --> 02:12:55.441
And,

5418
02:12:55.441 --> 02:12:55.980
uh,

5419
02:12:55.980 --> 02:12:57.960
it's just an interesting story if you,

5420
02:12:57.961 --> 02:12:58.560
if you,

5421
02:12:58.560 --> 02:12:59.310
if,

5422
02:12:59.310 --> 02:13:00.730
if I wish I knew the whole thing and bettering,

5423
02:13:00.750 --> 02:13:02.970
so she's like a one woman boy band.

5424
02:13:03.120 --> 02:13:03.750
Yeah.

5425
02:13:03.750 --> 02:13:08.750
If manufactured from Australia and there was this other girl named Iggy Azalea

5426
02:13:09.391 --> 02:13:12.570
banks is not as easy just to Zillia banks.

5427
02:13:12.660 --> 02:13:17.070
Zulia banks who she's actually nick cannon's ex girlfriend too.

5428
02:13:17.100 --> 02:13:17.310
Yeah.

5429
02:13:17.310 --> 02:13:19.470
And she's actually got a little bit of talent,

5430
02:13:20.160 --> 02:13:23.850
but this ag girl is stealing all her uh,

5431
02:13:24.070 --> 02:13:25.380

5432

5437
02:13:29.850 --> 02:13:29.971
Yeah.

5438
02:13:29.971 --> 02:13:30.910
She's with which one?

5439
02:13:31.080 --> 02:13:31.791
Nick Griffin.

5440
02:13:31.791 --> 02:13:32.190

5441
02:13:32.190 --> 02:13:32.520

Lakers.

5444
02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:40.620
And who's the other one that's Azealia banks.

5445
02:13:40.680 --> 02:13:42.660
Azealia banks is the legit one.

5446
02:13:42.690 --> 02:13:43.140
Yeah.

5447
02:13:43.140 --> 02:13:44.190
She's like a singer though.

5448
02:13:44.340 --> 02:13:46.770
And Iggy Azalea is dating someone named swaggy.

5449
02:13:47.340 --> 02:13:47.581
Well,

His name is nick something or another.

5453
02:13:52.020 --> 02:13:56.590
He lives on my old street like three houses down from me and he's a swaggy p is

5455
02:13:58.051 --> 02:14:00.420
Which is dumb because his name doesn't have a fucking pee in it.

5456
02:14:01.140 --> 02:14:03.000
Well for his penis clearly.

5457
02:14:03.030 --> 02:14:06.840
And then as he threatened like snoop Dogg like made fun of Ag and then uh,

5458
02:14:07.290 --> 02:14:07.771

02:14:07.771 --> 02:14:07.981
Yo,

He's going to beat up snoop.

5462
02:14:11.040 --> 02:14:11.820
And Snoop was like,

5463
02:14:11.820 --> 02:14:12.390
I'm sorry,

5464
02:14:12.390 --> 02:14:15.980
are you saying he's going to beat up a cultural icon because he made fun of him,

5465
02:14:16.650 --> 02:14:18.450
but then apparently snoop apologized.

5466
02:14:18.840 --> 02:14:19.451
Well yeah,

5467
02:14:19.451 --> 02:14:20.790
but then like what do they want over there?

5468
02:14:21.480 --> 02:14:22.300
Texting people again.

5469
02:14:22.300 --> 02:14:23.150
I'm looking at a,

5470
02:14:23.160 --> 02:14:24.510
I just posted the picture of you.

5471
02:14:24.630 --> 02:14:25.180
Yeah,

5472
02:14:25.180 --> 02:14:26.190
just looking at the comments.

5473
02:14:26.400 --> 02:14:27.560
I'm checking them out right now.

5474
02:14:27.570 --> 02:14:31.110
Like staring into Satan's asshole looking for advice and a thing up.

5475
02:14:31.350 --> 02:14:31.801
It says,

5476
02:14:31.801 --> 02:14:32.371
oh my God,

5477
02:14:32.371 --> 02:14:34.560
that's the number 1.0 mg.

5478
02:14:35.160 --> 02:14:35.580
You want to see,

5479
02:14:35.580 --> 02:14:36.151
oh my God,

5480
02:14:36.151 --> 02:14:36.984
look at this Bryan.

5481
02:14:37.050 --> 02:14:41.100
This is a five megabyte hard drive being loaded onto a plane.

5482
02:14:41.101 --> 02:14:41.940
I'd seen that so far.

5483
02:14:41.941 --> 02:14:44.190
Yeah that's a five.

5484
02:14:44.580 --> 02:14:44.980
Pull it up,

5485
02:14:44.980 --> 02:14:45.900
put it on the online.

5486
02:14:45.901 --> 02:14:50.901
It's on my Twitter from December 29th from 1956 a five megabyte hard drive being

5487
02:14:51.961 --> 02:14:54.840
loaded into the back of a Pan Am plane.

5488
02:14:56.600 --> 02:15:00.570
What did Neil degrasse Tyson tweet the other day just cause we can't uh,

5489
02:15:01.290 --> 02:15:03.230
something about those uh,

5490
02:15:03.870 --> 02:15:06.750
those formations that we found ancient formations doesn't mean that aliens

5491
02:15:06.760 --> 02:15:08.490
visitors because we don't know what they are,

5492
02:15:08.700 --> 02:15:11.400
which ancient formations of these years and it was just talking as somebody

5493
02:15:11.460 --> 02:15:12.261
retweeted and I'm,

5494
02:15:12.261 --> 02:15:15.060
I'm obviously horribly butchering it and misquoting it but

5495
02:15:16.790 --> 02:15:17.010
no,

5496
02:15:17.010 --> 02:15:18.270
I'm just saying God looking at that.

5497
02:15:18.660 --> 02:15:19.140
Let me see that.

5498
02:15:19.140 --> 02:15:21.020
Look at that thing and it's insanity.

5499
02:15:21.360 --> 02:15:22.470
Five megabytes.

5500
02:15:22.710 --> 02:15:25.380
If your phone at five megabytes you'd be so angry.

5501
02:15:25.410 --> 02:15:26.243
Yeah.

5502
02:15:26.390 --> 02:15:26.511
<v 6>Hi.</v>

5503
02:15:26.511 --> 02:15:27.344
Why is your phone full?

5504
02:15:27.350 --> 02:15:28.250
I got a text,

5505
02:15:29.750 --> 02:15:31.550
somebody tried to send me a picture of my phone,

5506
02:15:31.551 --> 02:15:32.660
just keeps rebooting.

5507
02:15:33.620 --> 02:15:34.520
It's pretty great.

5508
02:15:34.550 --> 02:15:35.840
I was cleaning out my office the other day.

5509
02:15:35.841 --> 02:15:39.470
I was getting rid of my old Mac pro member that that huge hour,

5510
02:15:40.070 --> 02:15:42.510
cause I turned it on and see if it was even worth doing it.

5511
02:15:42.511 --> 02:15:44.230
And now it's completely useless now,

5512
02:15:44.390 --> 02:15:46.540
but it's so heavy and it's so like,

5513
02:15:47.090 --> 02:15:51.590
and now I'm replacing with this little Mac Imac that's like a thin piece of

5514
02:15:51.591 --> 02:15:54.070
paper and so much more powerful power.

5515
02:15:54.260 --> 02:15:56.570
Well that new Mac spinny thing,

5516
02:15:56.571 --> 02:15:56.871
the one,

5517
02:15:56.871 --> 02:15:57.710
the circular thing,

5518
02:15:57.711 --> 02:15:58.640
it looks like a thermos.

5519
02:15:58.910 --> 02:15:59.630
What's that called?

5520
02:15:59.630 --> 02:16:00.290
Mac Pro.

5521
02:16:00.290 --> 02:16:01.123
The Mac pro

5522
02:16:01.740 --> 02:16:03.570
<v 2>called a tornado or a tunnel or something like that.</v>

5523
02:16:03.800 --> 02:16:05.550
It's like something about the cooling.

5524
02:16:05.720 --> 02:16:05.940
Yeah,

5525
02:16:05.940 --> 02:16:06.261
like the,

5526
02:16:06.261 --> 02:16:09.330
the shape is conducive to more cooling.

5527
02:16:09.530 --> 02:16:10.850
<v 6>I almost got one of those things,</v>

5528
02:16:10.851 --> 02:16:10.981
but,

5529
02:16:10.981 --> 02:16:11.814
and then you could,

5530
02:16:11.820 --> 02:16:13.460
that thing gets expensive fast.

5531
02:16:13.910 --> 02:16:14.630
Yeah.

5532
02:16:14.630 --> 02:16:17.750
Like the one night priced out was almost $10,000.

5533
02:16:18.020 --> 02:16:19.400
Why don't you go back to making videos?

5534
02:16:19.460 --> 02:16:19.851
What's right?

5535
02:16:19.851 --> 02:16:20.684
I just got a new,

5536
02:16:20.900 --> 02:16:22.000
I just got a new the camera.

5537
02:16:23.110 --> 02:16:23.630
Yes.

5538
02:16:23.630 --> 02:16:24.463
Yeah.

5539
02:16:24.580 --> 02:16:25.271
Make videos.

5540
02:16:25.271 --> 02:16:26.120
Let's make something happen.

5541
02:16:26.180 --> 02:16:26.660
I am,

5542
02:16:26.660 --> 02:16:29.000
I just got a new four k camera and the new five k Imac.

5543
02:16:29.020 --> 02:16:31.480
I'm been in four k filming in four k.

5544
02:16:31.780 --> 02:16:34.420
It's amazing because like you can film this whole entire room,

5545
02:16:34.570 --> 02:16:37.930
but later if you want to like folk like say like you want to focus on just

5546
02:16:37.931 --> 02:16:38.764
Russell,

5547
02:16:38.770 --> 02:16:42.160
you could just zoom in on Russell and it's like amazing hds.

5548
02:16:42.210 --> 02:16:42.580
It doesn't,

5549
02:16:42.580 --> 02:16:43.300
it doesn't.

5550
02:16:43.300 --> 02:16:43.451
Yeah.

5551
02:16:43.451 --> 02:16:44.350
It doesn't look zoomed in.

5552
02:16:44.351 --> 02:16:45.184
So it's

5553
02:16:45.270 --> 02:16:46.103
<v 2>Brian.</v>

5554
02:16:46.610 --> 02:16:48.480
This best shit ever is,

5555
02:16:48.481 --> 02:16:49.314
is video editing.

5556
02:16:49.320 --> 02:16:49.560
Yeah.

5557
02:16:49.560 --> 02:16:50.251
It's the best stuff.

5558
02:16:50.251 --> 02:16:51.330
He does go red band.

5559
02:16:51.360 --> 02:16:52.260
That's why I hired him.

5560
02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:55.160
I hired him for video editing some along along the line it became a podcaster.

5561
02:16:55.830 --> 02:16:56.550
Yeah.

5562
02:16:56.550 --> 02:16:59.740
And I tried to start his own careers is video stuff was the shit I,

5563
02:16:59.741 --> 02:16:59.871
you know,

5564
02:16:59.871 --> 02:17:00.181
it's funny,

5565
02:17:00.181 --> 02:17:05.040
as I remember from the first time I came into your podcast and then to Brian

5566
02:17:05.250 --> 02:17:09.090
being just that guy and now he's a comic and he's this other shit and I'm like,

5567
02:17:09.120 --> 02:17:10.020
what the fuck happened here?

5568
02:17:10.080 --> 02:17:10.913
He's branching out.

5569
02:17:11.250 --> 02:17:12.240
I don't like this evolution.

5570
02:17:12.270 --> 02:17:13.103
He's moving up.

5571
02:17:13.290 --> 02:17:14.123
Come on man.

5572
02:17:14.390 --> 02:17:14.970
<v 6>Show man,</v>

5573
02:17:14.970 --> 02:17:15.803
I need to disciple.

5574
02:17:15.820 --> 02:17:16.940
Blew the fuck out Joe.

5575
02:17:17.200 --> 02:17:17.441
Joe,

5576
02:17:17.441 --> 02:17:18.610
you need to stifle people.

5577
02:17:18.611 --> 02:17:20.830
Show it gets almost 11 million downloads a month.

5578
02:17:20.831 --> 02:17:21.600
That's craziness.

5579
02:17:21.600 --> 02:17:22.130
That's it.

5580
02:17:22.130 --> 02:17:22.431
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

5581
02:17:22.431 --> 02:17:27.431
He became something that was out there slinging deck and I know making videos.

5582
02:17:29.210 --> 02:17:30.480
I don't know what this black video a baby,

5583
02:17:30.650 --> 02:17:31.760
<v 6>but I don't want it in my head.</v>

5584
02:17:32.090 --> 02:17:33.380
I know I don't want it in my head.

5585
02:17:33.381 --> 02:17:34.520
Brian [inaudible],

5586
02:17:34.640 --> 02:17:35.960

5589
02:17:39.920 --> 02:17:40.281

5591
02:17:41.500 --> 02:17:42.291
Here's the good news.

5592
02:17:42.291 --> 02:17:44.600
That song lasts two weeks and it's gone.

5593
02:17:45.450 --> 02:17:46.010
You know,

5594
02:17:46.010 --> 02:17:46.221
you know what?

5595
02:17:46.221 --> 02:17:47.630
The fucking courses I got.

5596
02:17:47.631 --> 02:17:48.464

5597
02:17:48.920 --> 02:17:49.820
Baking Soda.

5598
02:17:51.130 --> 02:17:51.980
You know what's so funny?

5599
02:17:51.990 --> 02:17:53.060
It's cutting cocaine.

5600
02:17:53.980 --> 02:17:56.330
Eric B called me the Eric.

5601
02:17:56.470 --> 02:17:57.080

5608
02:18:05.930 --> 02:18:06.763
Baking Soda.

5609
02:18:07.190 --> 02:18:09.770
What the fuck is wrong with these young motherfuckers?

5610
02:18:10.710 --> 02:18:10.951
<v 2>Pop,</v>

5611
02:18:10.951 --> 02:18:11.161

Oh,

5616
02:18:14.230 --> 02:18:16.020
well the how did that become famous?

5617
02:18:16.320 --> 02:18:17.153
Because somebody poked her.

5618
02:18:17.750 --> 02:18:19.060
Faced.

5619
02:18:19.130 --> 02:18:20.100
How did that become famous?

5620
02:18:20.101 --> 02:18:20.910
Huh?

5621
02:18:20.910 --> 02:18:22.990
Remember when she got fat for a little bit was okay,

5622
02:18:23.280 --> 02:18:25.230
she got fat for a little bit and then boom,

5623
02:18:25.231 --> 02:18:26.880
snap back like a champ.

5624
02:18:27.060 --> 02:18:27.990
I'm fat right now.

5625
02:18:28.330 --> 02:18:30.930

you know the ways to get thinner.

5630
02:18:34.590 --> 02:18:35.430
Why don't you hire a trainer?

5631
02:18:35.431 --> 02:18:35.580
You,

5632
02:18:35.580 --> 02:18:36.900

5633
02:18:36.901 --> 02:18:37.810

Yeah.

5636
02:18:43.260 --> 02:18:47.220
B can not be annoying while you're traveling nutritionist as well.

5637
02:18:47.550 --> 02:18:48.720
You could definitely get that.

5638
02:18:49.080 --> 02:18:51.180
I guarantee you there's a guy out there,

5639
02:18:51.181 --> 02:18:54.480
especially like there's a lot of young people or Gal,

5640
02:18:54.760 --> 02:18:56.100
but if it's cal might be a problem.

5641
02:18:56.670 --> 02:18:58.920
I'll end up fucking are trying to feed their own fucker.

5642
02:18:58.921 --> 02:19:00.870
Then she might be angry at all your sexism.

5643
02:19:00.920 --> 02:19:01.700
Unless she's Asian.

5644
02:19:01.700 --> 02:19:02.533
She won.

5645
02:19:03.270 --> 02:19:03.601
She won.

5646
02:19:03.601 --> 02:19:05.850
Expect what if she's Asian trainer girl,

5647
02:19:05.880 --> 02:19:07.110
she wasn't expecting fucked.

5648
02:19:08.220 --> 02:19:08.960
Really.

5649
02:19:08.960 --> 02:19:10.140
Don't even understand that comment.

5650
02:19:10.530 --> 02:19:12.750
You don't even question when he says something stupid.

5651
02:19:12.751 --> 02:19:13.650
Just take a deep breath.

5652
02:19:13.651 --> 02:19:14.484
Go like this.

5653
02:19:15.930 --> 02:19:16.763
Yup.

5654
02:19:17.210 --> 02:19:17.640

5662

You want to laugh?

5668
02:19:36.251 --> 02:19:36.741
I want them to,

5669

02:19:43.340 --> 02:19:44.870
Somebody will contact you.

5677
02:19:44.871 --> 02:19:47.240
I guarantee you whoever you are out there that is thinking,

5678
02:19:47.241 --> 02:19:47.541
fuck,

5679
02:19:47.541 --> 02:19:47.961
I'll do that.

5680
02:19:47.961 --> 02:19:49.190
I don't go on the road with Russell Peters.

5681
02:19:49.191 --> 02:19:50.024
I love comedy.

5682
02:19:50.090 --> 02:19:50.923
Threaten me and man,

5683
02:19:50.960 --> 02:19:51.830
make sure I eat right.

5684
02:19:52.430 --> 02:19:53.330
Make sure you eat right.

5685
02:19:53.331 --> 02:19:53.950
That's hard.

5686
02:19:53.950 --> 02:19:54.350
Yeah.

5687
02:19:54.350 --> 02:19:56.420
They got a water for me because I'll fuck it up.

5688
02:19:56.480 --> 02:20:00.680
She's got to be caught that he parks right in front of the door in case you get

5689
02:20:00.681 --> 02:20:01.400
room service.

5690
02:20:01.400 --> 02:20:01.550
No,

5691
02:20:01.550 --> 02:20:02.121
I want to see.

5692
02:20:02.121 --> 02:20:03.320
I'm pretty good with that.

5693
02:20:03.320 --> 02:20:03.621
I will.

5694
02:20:03.621 --> 02:20:06.260
I will diligently do what you eat this.

5695
02:20:06.261 --> 02:20:07.094
All right,

5696
02:20:07.100 --> 02:20:08.270
but if you tell me to order it,

5697
02:20:08.271 --> 02:20:09.530
I'll fucking modify it.

5698
02:20:09.710 --> 02:20:10.640
Get an egg white omelet.

5699
02:20:10.641 --> 02:20:11.780
Can I get cheese in that place?

5700
02:20:11.781 --> 02:20:12.201
You know what I mean?

5701
02:20:12.201 --> 02:20:14.090
Like so I'll fuck it up.

5702
02:20:14.240 --> 02:20:15.260
He's got to give you the food.

5703
02:20:15.290 --> 02:20:15.411
Yeah.

5704
02:20:15.411 --> 02:20:15.770
Here,

5705
02:20:15.770 --> 02:20:16.603
eat this stupid.

5706
02:20:16.790 --> 02:20:18.710
You want it to be like all laid out.

5707
02:20:18.711 --> 02:20:19.070
Take,

5708
02:20:19.070 --> 02:20:19.670
take,

5709
02:20:19.670 --> 02:20:20.900
take these vitamins.

5710
02:20:20.901 --> 02:20:22.040
Not those vitamins.

5711
02:20:22.070 --> 02:20:27.070
What is your number one vice food and a lack of motivation to get up and do

5712
02:20:27.681 --> 02:20:28.250
anything.

5713
02:20:28.250 --> 02:20:28.850
Yeah.

5714
02:20:28.850 --> 02:20:29.150
Why?

5715
02:20:29.150 --> 02:20:30.080
Because you get too much money.

5716
02:20:30.081 --> 02:20:30.914
That's what it is.

5717
02:20:31.070 --> 02:20:32.440
Too much of a bullet.

5718
02:20:32.810 --> 02:20:33.021
No.

5719
02:20:33.021 --> 02:20:35.120
I want to let you know like I want to get up and run,

5720
02:20:35.121 --> 02:20:35.954
but then I'm like,

5721
02:20:36.290 --> 02:20:36.980
ah,

5722
02:20:36.980 --> 02:20:37.611
I'm tired.

5723
02:20:37.611 --> 02:20:39.710
I should probably take this time to enjoy the sleep,

5724
02:20:40.670 --> 02:20:40.931
you know?

5725
02:20:40.931 --> 02:20:41.271
And I do.

5726
02:20:41.271 --> 02:20:42.170
In those situations,

5727
02:20:42.770 --> 02:20:44.750
I get outside of myself and I say,

5728
02:20:44.751 --> 02:20:45.710
what would I tell myself?

5729
02:20:46.190 --> 02:20:46.460
Right.

5730
02:20:46.460 --> 02:20:47.840
If I was standing over me,

5731
02:20:47.870 --> 02:20:51.830
if I was like hired to be my own motivator and then I would ignore myself,

5732
02:20:54.360 --> 02:20:55.340
I would get up and be like,

5733
02:20:55.370 --> 02:20:56.091
get up you fat.

5734
02:20:56.091 --> 02:20:56.470
Fuck.

5735
02:20:56.470 --> 02:20:56.841
All right.

5736
02:20:56.841 --> 02:20:59.030
Just leave the room and then my fucking out of body.

5737
02:20:59.031 --> 02:21:01.350
So I'll leave the room and my fat self would just sit there and go,

5738
02:21:01.351 --> 02:21:01.440
oh,

5739
02:21:01.440 --> 02:21:02.570
thank God that motherfucker's gone.

5740
02:21:03.680 --> 02:21:05.240
Maybe you're just more comfortable than men.

5741
02:21:05.660 --> 02:21:06.350
Maybe it's that.

5742
02:21:06.350 --> 02:21:06.651
No,

5743
02:21:06.651 --> 02:21:07.191
you know what it is.

5744
02:21:07.191 --> 02:21:10.910
I definitely need to get my fat ass back in shape because am going to India and

5745
02:21:10.911 --> 02:21:13.370
the first thing they're going to say to me is we've gotten so fat.

5746
02:21:13.700 --> 02:21:14.270
That's the fat.

5747
02:21:14.270 --> 02:21:15.530
They have no hesitation.

5748
02:21:15.531 --> 02:21:16.364
You've gotten fat.

5749
02:21:16.760 --> 02:21:18.250
They'll say that to you right away.

5750
02:21:18.290 --> 02:21:19.041
Do that man.

5751
02:21:19.041 --> 02:21:19.940
You've gone fat.

5752
02:21:20.480 --> 02:21:21.141
They'll poke it.

5753
02:21:21.141 --> 02:21:21.381
Look,

5754
02:21:21.381 --> 02:21:22.214
you've gotten fat.

5755
02:21:22.580 --> 02:21:23.181
They'll show you,

5756
02:21:23.181 --> 02:21:23.421
look,

5757
02:21:23.421 --> 02:21:24.140
you've gone fat.

5758
02:21:24.140 --> 02:21:24.621
I try to eat,

5759
02:21:24.621 --> 02:21:25.401
you know,

5760
02:21:25.401 --> 02:21:25.891
because I get,

5761
02:21:25.891 --> 02:21:26.481
and then I get mad.

5762
02:21:26.481 --> 02:21:27.710
I want to hit motherfuckers because I'm like,

5763
02:21:27.711 --> 02:21:28.221
shut up.

5764
02:21:28.221 --> 02:21:29.000
I know I'm fat.

5765
02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:30.140
I don't need you to remind me.

5766
02:21:30.141 --> 02:21:31.100
Is that just the culture?

5767
02:21:31.370 --> 02:21:31.611
Yeah,

5768
02:21:31.611 --> 02:21:31.841
they,

5769
02:21:31.841 --> 02:21:34.160
it's just one of those things where it's not like offensive.

5770
02:21:34.940 --> 02:21:35.290
Just like,

5771
02:21:35.290 --> 02:21:35.640
oh,

5772
02:21:35.640 --> 02:21:37.070
what's with all the gang rape in India?

5773
02:21:37.310 --> 02:21:38.090
What's all that about?

5774
02:21:38.090 --> 02:21:38.351
Hey,

5775
02:21:38.351 --> 02:21:38.571
you know,

5776
02:21:38.571 --> 02:21:39.021
I don't know.

5777
02:21:39.021 --> 02:21:40.130
I'm not part of that gang.

5778
02:21:41.210 --> 02:21:42.710
But I mean it happens so often.

5779
02:21:42.711 --> 02:21:45.680
Gang rapes and murders like on buses and shit and trains.

5780
02:21:45.850 --> 02:21:46.340
We had to,

5781
02:21:46.340 --> 02:21:47.150
I don't know.

5782
02:21:47.150 --> 02:21:49.280
I don't know those parts of India where it's been happening,

5783
02:21:49.281 --> 02:21:50.114
but uh,

5784
02:21:50.240 --> 02:21:50.571
it's not,

5785
02:21:50.571 --> 02:21:51.111
it's not good,

5786
02:21:51.111 --> 02:21:52.790
but that's a gang dance a lot out there.

5787
02:21:52.791 --> 02:21:53.150
Right.

5788
02:21:53.150 --> 02:21:55.760
There's a lot of dancing going on in India.

5789
02:21:56.030 --> 02:21:56.660
No.

5790
02:21:56.660 --> 02:21:57.493
Took a breath.

5791
02:21:59.660 --> 02:22:00.231
I don't even know what,

5792
02:22:00.231 --> 02:22:01.180
ask an Asian trainer.

5793
02:22:01.190 --> 02:22:02.023
Maybe she'll tell Ya.

5794
02:22:02.330 --> 02:22:05.810
I think for real that we could find you someone that could put you in good

5795
02:22:05.811 --> 02:22:06.111
shape,

5796
02:22:06.111 --> 02:22:08.750
but you have to figure out a way to do that shit on your own man.

5797
02:22:08.870 --> 02:22:09.260
You up.

5798
02:22:09.260 --> 02:22:09.441
Well,

5799
02:22:09.441 --> 02:22:09.561
no.

5800
02:22:09.561 --> 02:22:12.080
Once I get into the routine and I see what it is and you're good.

5801
02:22:12.110 --> 02:22:12.351
Yeah.

5802
02:22:12.351 --> 02:22:12.801
Then I'll be like,

5803
02:22:12.801 --> 02:22:13.071
all right,

5804
02:22:13.071 --> 02:22:15.080
I got this for me.

5805
02:22:15.110 --> 02:22:16.700
If I don't maximize my time,

5806
02:22:16.790 --> 02:22:17.623
I can't sleep.

5807
02:22:18.440 --> 02:22:19.070
Right.

5808
02:22:19.070 --> 02:22:19.903
That's me.

5809
02:22:20.230 --> 02:22:20.901
I guess I,

5810
02:22:20.901 --> 02:22:21.321
if I,

5811
02:22:21.321 --> 02:22:22.300
if I'm like almost,

5812
02:22:22.400 --> 02:22:24.450
I was a fat fuck today and a bunch of stupid shit.

5813
02:22:24.480 --> 02:22:25.231
I didn't work out all,

5814
02:22:25.231 --> 02:22:26.064
I'm such a pussy.

5815
02:22:26.130 --> 02:22:26.730
<v 7>I'll be like,</v>

5816
02:22:26.730 --> 02:22:28.050
my head will bow if I,

5817
02:22:28.080 --> 02:22:28.350
I,

5818
02:22:28.350 --> 02:22:30.960
if I feel like if I don't respect myself,

5819
02:22:31.290 --> 02:22:32.580
like you lazy bitch,

5820
02:22:32.581 --> 02:22:33.810
you were supposed to do this.

5821
02:22:33.811 --> 02:22:34.770
You were supposed to do that.

5822
02:22:34.771 --> 02:22:35.660
You were supposed to write,

5823
02:22:35.661 --> 02:22:36.600
you were supposed to get this done.

5824
02:22:36.601 --> 02:22:37.650
You're supposed to do a podcast,

5825
02:22:37.770 --> 02:22:39.000
whatever it is I'm supposed to do.

5826
02:22:39.001 --> 02:22:40.440
If I somehow or another blow it off,

5827
02:22:40.710 --> 02:22:41.543
I can't sleep.

5828
02:22:41.820 --> 02:22:43.590
So I've realized that about me,

5829
02:22:43.860 --> 02:22:45.060
so I just do it.

5830
02:22:45.390 --> 02:22:46.021
I just do it.

5831
02:22:46.021 --> 02:22:47.370
Even if I don't want to do what I do it,

5832
02:22:47.371 --> 02:22:48.570
and then I feel good that I did it.

5833
02:22:49.080 --> 02:22:49.381
<v 3>Yeah.</v>

5834
02:22:49.381 --> 02:22:49.501
I,

5835
02:22:49.501 --> 02:22:49.771
you know,

5836
02:22:49.771 --> 02:22:51.090
I feel good when I do it.

5837
02:22:51.630 --> 02:22:51.850
Yeah.

5838
02:22:51.850 --> 02:22:53.730
I don't do what I don't feel anything when you,

5839
02:22:54.350 --> 02:22:55.183
do you know what I mean?

5840
02:22:55.910 --> 02:22:58.440
I think if I start doing it like in my head,

5841
02:22:58.441 --> 02:22:58.651
I'm like,

5842
02:22:58.651 --> 02:22:59.970
I know I should start.

5843
02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.190
I definitely had to have started this two weeks ago.

5844
02:23:02.580 --> 02:23:03.080
Do you,

5845
02:23:03.080 --> 02:23:04.100
did you ever your

5846
02:23:04.760 --> 02:23:05.930
<v 7>except of resistance,</v>

5847
02:23:05.931 --> 02:23:06.231
you know,

5848
02:23:06.231 --> 02:23:07.530
the concept of like a,

5849
02:23:07.550 --> 02:23:09.920
that resistance is something we battle all the time.

5850
02:23:09.921 --> 02:23:11.720
Resistance keeps us from getting worked on.

5851
02:23:11.960 --> 02:23:14.060
Resistance keeps us from accomplishing goals.

5852
02:23:14.090 --> 02:23:14.690
Absolutely.

5853
02:23:14.690 --> 02:23:15.441
That is like keeps,

5854
02:23:15.441 --> 02:23:18.110
it's like this thing that you like you have to overcome.

5855
02:23:18.280 --> 02:23:19.910
And there's this book called the war of art.

5856
02:23:19.970 --> 02:23:20.630
If you read it,

5857
02:23:20.630 --> 02:23:21.463
no heard of it.

5858
02:23:21.610 --> 02:23:22.443
Now,

5859
02:23:22.480 --> 02:23:22.760
uh,

5860
02:23:22.760 --> 02:23:24.610
the guy's name is Steven Pressfield and it's,

5861
02:23:24.630 --> 02:23:26.080
he's got a really interesting story.

5862
02:23:26.081 --> 02:23:29.390
He's an author and he was kind of a loser until he was like 40 and then by the

5863
02:23:29.391 --> 02:23:30.111
time he was 40,

5864
02:23:30.111 --> 02:23:30.830
he realized like,

5865
02:23:30.830 --> 02:23:30.981
Oh,

5866
02:23:30.981 --> 02:23:32.630
I'm just like not working enough.

5867
02:23:32.631 --> 02:23:33.770
I'm not doing what I need to do.

5868
02:23:33.771 --> 02:23:34.790
And that's why I'm unhappy.

5869
02:23:34.970 --> 02:23:37.130
It's one of the reasons why it's just not coming together.

5870
02:23:37.131 --> 02:23:41.630
And he realized that this is this thing that he was battling and he calls it

5871
02:23:41.631 --> 02:23:42.980
resistance and he's sort of like,

5872
02:23:43.460 --> 02:23:48.020
he outlines it in this really like easy to follow way that you can remember in

5873
02:23:48.021 --> 02:23:51.620
your mind and it actually can aid you in getting things done.

5874
02:23:51.770 --> 02:23:53.870
I used to keep him around the studio.

5875
02:23:53.871 --> 02:23:54.471
Remember Brian?

5876
02:23:54.471 --> 02:23:55.580
I used to hand them out to people.

5877
02:23:55.730 --> 02:23:56.660
I had a stack of them,

5878
02:23:57.180 --> 02:23:58.100
probably get a stack of them,

5879
02:23:58.110 --> 02:23:58.701
hand them in here.

5880
02:23:58.701 --> 02:24:02.780
It's one of the most valuable books for any like creative type or writer or or

5881
02:24:02.781 --> 02:24:04.180
perform or even of,

5882
02:24:04.290 --> 02:24:04.531
<v 3>yeah,</v>

5883
02:24:04.531 --> 02:24:04.831
I do.

5884
02:24:04.831 --> 02:24:08.280
I definitely need to change something in order to get out of this sort of,

5885
02:24:09.120 --> 02:24:10.290
in order to change things,

5886
02:24:10.291 --> 02:24:11.880
you've got to change something to change things.

5887
02:24:11.900 --> 02:24:12.550
<v 7>It's obviously,</v>

5888
02:24:12.550 --> 02:24:12.860
well,

5889
02:24:12.860 --> 02:24:16.850
if you're willing to hire someone to come on the road with you and then meet you

5890
02:24:16.851 --> 02:24:18.100
at your house when you're at home and,

5891
02:24:18.200 --> 02:24:20.810
and train you and you can definitely do that.

5892
02:24:20.930 --> 02:24:24.290
Kevin James loss like fucking 70 something pounds.

5893
02:24:24.380 --> 02:24:27.440
He hired this nutritionist to cook for him every day.

5894
02:24:27.740 --> 02:24:29.570
She had all these meals prepared,

5895
02:24:29.600 --> 02:24:31.340
like he went completely v there we got,

5896
02:24:31.341 --> 02:24:32.061
we've got a copy of it.

5897
02:24:32.061 --> 02:24:33.720
The more of ours Boone,

5898
02:24:33.740 --> 02:24:36.640
Jamie's a Ninja and I got wet goddess.

5899
02:24:36.720 --> 02:24:38.390
Does that one have a signature in it?

5900
02:24:38.391 --> 02:24:39.620
You'd better not give them the signature.

5901
02:24:39.630 --> 02:24:40.463
One.

5902
02:24:41.200 --> 02:24:45.110
Unsigned not signed to me and says to Joseph,

5903
02:24:45.130 --> 02:24:45.500
hey,

5904
02:24:45.500 --> 02:24:45.700
hey,

5905
02:24:45.700 --> 02:24:46.533
wait a minute.

5906
02:24:47.450 --> 02:24:49.430
I know it's up to look.

5907
02:24:49.431 --> 02:24:50.330
I show people that come and go,

5908
02:24:50.370 --> 02:24:50.901
what could she,

5909
02:24:50.901 --> 02:24:51.734
I met her,

5910
02:24:51.990 --> 02:24:52.823
her Sean right here.

5911
02:24:53.390 --> 02:24:54.201
It's a weird thing.

5912
02:24:54.201 --> 02:24:55.070
People in signatures.

5913
02:24:55.071 --> 02:24:55.730
Right.

5914
02:24:55.730 --> 02:24:56.061
But uh,

5915
02:24:56.061 --> 02:24:57.050
that book is excellent,

5916
02:24:57.051 --> 02:24:57.290
man.

5917
02:24:57.290 --> 02:24:57.800
It's really,

5918
02:24:57.800 --> 02:24:58.530
really excellent.

5919
02:24:58.530 --> 02:24:59.960
The guys are really good guy.

5920
02:25:00.360 --> 02:25:03.650
Had him on the podcast and he's just like a sweet guy to talk to.

5921
02:25:03.651 --> 02:25:03.941
Like you,

5922
02:25:03.941 --> 02:25:04.220
you'll,

5923
02:25:04.220 --> 02:25:05.270
you enjoy his company.

5924
02:25:05.710 --> 02:25:05.930
Yeah.

5925
02:25:05.930 --> 02:25:06.980
It's a great book too.

5926
02:25:07.010 --> 02:25:07.610
I'm going to take that.

5927
02:25:07.610 --> 02:25:08.210
You're not gonna to read it,

5928
02:25:08.210 --> 02:25:08.480
right?

5929
02:25:08.480 --> 02:25:12.140
I am going to to the odds will the odds you actually want it reading it.

5930
02:25:12.440 --> 02:25:13.101
The odds are low.

5931
02:25:13.101 --> 02:25:13.934
20%.

5932
02:25:13.970 --> 02:25:15.260
I'd say less.

5933
02:25:15.480 --> 02:25:16.313
I'd say 10

5934
02:25:17.970 --> 02:25:19.640
<v 3>but the intention will be there.</v>

5935
02:25:19.740 --> 02:25:22.580
My Dad used to say the road to hell is paved with good intention.

5936
02:25:22.581 --> 02:25:23.414
It's true.

5937
02:25:23.440 --> 02:25:24.280
What are the odds

5938
02:25:24.280 --> 02:25:25.780
<v 2>of you actually hiring?</v>

5939
02:25:26.590 --> 02:25:26.741
Well,

5940
02:25:26.741 --> 02:25:27.640
if somebody steps up,

5941
02:25:27.641 --> 02:25:28.474
I'm in.

5942
02:25:28.580 --> 02:25:29.413
<v 8>Yeah.</v>

5943
02:25:30.670 --> 02:25:32.620
<v 2>Just have somebody open for you that does fitness.</v>

5944
02:25:34.410 --> 02:25:34.820
No,

5945
02:25:34.820 --> 02:25:35.310
you don't do what?

5946
02:25:35.310 --> 02:25:36.031
They're not good.

5947
02:25:36.031 --> 02:25:36.864
Then they're going to suck.

5948
02:25:36.960 --> 02:25:37.081
Yeah.

5949
02:25:37.081 --> 02:25:38.190
They eat dick on stage.

5950
02:25:38.220 --> 02:25:38.940
They're going to be fitness.

5951
02:25:38.940 --> 02:25:41.080
Dig in their mouth and they're going to be asking you for advice.

5952
02:25:41.090 --> 02:25:44.970
You going to be paying them for them to ask you how to be a comedian.

5953
02:25:45.130 --> 02:25:45.510
Yeah.

5954
02:25:45.510 --> 02:25:45.931
And you're like,

5955
02:25:45.931 --> 02:25:46.500
oh great.

5956
02:25:46.500 --> 02:25:47.520
Now I'm training you.

5957
02:25:47.630 --> 02:25:48.451
I got this joke,

5958
02:25:48.451 --> 02:25:49.800
I've been thinking about going on stage.

5959
02:25:49.860 --> 02:25:51.130
I got this joke on to run a bar,

5960
02:25:51.690 --> 02:25:52.060
sit down,

5961
02:25:52.060 --> 02:25:53.890
I go to notes are run by money.

5962
02:25:54.650 --> 02:25:55.470
Imagine that.

5963
02:25:55.470 --> 02:25:55.591
Oh,

5964
02:25:55.591 --> 02:25:56.220
it's terrible.

5965
02:25:56.220 --> 02:25:56.790
I've had it.

5966
02:25:56.790 --> 02:25:59.040
You have you taken guys in the row with you that were mistakes?

5967
02:25:59.670 --> 02:26:00.030
Yeah,

5968
02:26:00.030 --> 02:26:00.600
I have.

5969
02:26:00.600 --> 02:26:01.410
I have indeed.

5970
02:26:01.410 --> 02:26:01.621
You know,

5971
02:26:01.621 --> 02:26:03.360
you regret that all the time.

5972
02:26:03.840 --> 02:26:04.531
What was it a mistake?

5973
02:26:04.531 --> 02:26:06.600
Because they bombed or because they weren't annoying.

5974
02:26:07.020 --> 02:26:07.440
Uh,

5975
02:26:07.440 --> 02:26:09.840
both because they weren't addressed that they bombed.

5976
02:26:09.890 --> 02:26:11.250
They thought they killed and you're like,

5977
02:26:12.360 --> 02:26:14.850
I can't have your dishonesty around me.

5978
02:26:15.030 --> 02:26:15.241
Yeah.

5979
02:26:15.241 --> 02:26:16.470
That's not healthy.

5980
02:26:16.770 --> 02:26:17.790
That becomes a real issue.

5981
02:26:17.810 --> 02:26:18.420
That that's,

5982
02:26:18.420 --> 02:26:20.040
that's where you find out where your,

5983
02:26:20.041 --> 02:26:20.460
uh,

5984
02:26:20.460 --> 02:26:25.200
your desire exceeds your talent and your ego dictates your movements.

5985
02:26:26.250 --> 02:26:27.150
That's good way of putting it.

5986
02:26:27.480 --> 02:26:27.970
You know,

5987
02:26:27.970 --> 02:26:30.090
the shielding yourself from reality.

5988
02:26:31.150 --> 02:26:32.510
It's like that,

5989
02:26:32.630 --> 02:26:35.520
that painful pill is like one of the most valuable pills.

5990
02:26:35.760 --> 02:26:38.750
Like when you don't have a good set and you can listen to it and go over it and

5991
02:26:38.751 --> 02:26:38.840
go,

5992
02:26:38.840 --> 02:26:39.590
oh,

5993
02:26:39.590 --> 02:26:41.550
like it will motivate you and you will.

5994
02:26:41.820 --> 02:26:43.920
And in seeing the things you do bad,

5995
02:26:43.921 --> 02:26:45.380
like a lot of people don't like it because they think,

5996
02:26:45.381 --> 02:26:45.571
oh,

5997
02:26:45.571 --> 02:26:49.850
this is going to remind me of my flaws and that's gonna make me see Jordan.

5998
02:26:49.860 --> 02:26:50.610
If you need that,

5999
02:26:50.610 --> 02:26:51.540
you need to look at that.

6000
02:26:51.541 --> 02:26:53.850
And then you need to look at when you were really great and go,

6001
02:26:54.510 --> 02:26:55.800
what was I doing different there?

6002
02:26:56.340 --> 02:26:58.650
And then get back in that mental space if he can.

6003
02:26:58.740 --> 02:27:00.360
You know what I did recently that helped me a lot.

6004
02:27:00.600 --> 02:27:01.261
You should do this.

6005
02:27:01.261 --> 02:27:01.950
It's really fun.

6006
02:27:01.950 --> 02:27:03.960
Do Ari Shaffir so skeptic tank,

6007
02:27:04.290 --> 02:27:04.441
Oh,

6008
02:27:04.441 --> 02:27:05.101
I've done that before.

6009
02:27:05.101 --> 02:27:05.910
I liked doing that.

6010
02:27:05.910 --> 02:27:06.331
It's great.

6011
02:27:06.331 --> 02:27:06.721
But he'll,

6012
02:27:06.721 --> 02:27:07.920
he does special episodes.

6013
02:27:07.921 --> 02:27:11.430
He's done like four or five of them or he goes over your special with you.

6014
02:27:11.820 --> 02:27:12.241
Oh really?

6015
02:27:12.241 --> 02:27:15.200
And he plays it and it asks you about the bets and,

6016
02:27:15.220 --> 02:27:17.310
and says what he really liked about this.

6017
02:27:17.311 --> 02:27:19.360
And did you purposely do it this way?

6018
02:27:19.361 --> 02:27:20.020
Like what?

6019
02:27:20.020 --> 02:27:20.730
That's kind of cool.

6020
02:27:20.730 --> 02:27:20.871
We,

6021
02:27:20.871 --> 02:27:20.971
yeah,

6022
02:27:20.971 --> 02:27:24.060
we did a five hour one for shiny happy Jihad.

6023
02:27:24.200 --> 02:27:24.690
Yeah.

6024
02:27:24.690 --> 02:27:26.400
We've just got baked and started rambling.

6025
02:27:26.820 --> 02:27:27.121
But,

6026
02:27:27.121 --> 02:27:27.750
uh,

6027
02:27:27.750 --> 02:27:28.590
after it was over,

6028
02:27:28.591 --> 02:27:28.951
I was like,

6029
02:27:28.951 --> 02:27:29.191
wow,

6030
02:27:29.191 --> 02:27:30.450
I learned a lot in that.

6031
02:27:30.660 --> 02:27:31.620
Like I learned like zoo,

6032
02:27:31.640 --> 02:27:35.040
it was all comedy that I hadn't listened to in like seven years.

6033
02:27:35.100 --> 02:27:35.260
Yeah,

6034
02:27:35.260 --> 02:27:35.371
it was.

6035
02:27:35.371 --> 02:27:36.150
It was all,

6036
02:27:36.150 --> 02:27:36.421
you know,

6037
02:27:36.421 --> 02:27:37.930
I've had people quote old bits to me,

6038
02:27:37.970 --> 02:27:38.070
go,

6039
02:27:38.070 --> 02:27:38.641
that's really funny.

6040
02:27:38.641 --> 02:27:39.061
Where'd you hear that?

6041
02:27:39.061 --> 02:27:39.281
And they go,

6042
02:27:39.281 --> 02:27:40.114
that's yours.

6043
02:27:41.490 --> 02:27:41.971
That's good.

6044
02:27:41.971 --> 02:27:42.990
I can't believe I wrote that.

6045
02:27:43.110 --> 02:27:45.570
I know there's some people are more of a fan of you than you are.

6046
02:27:46.040 --> 02:27:46.230
Yeah.

6047
02:27:46.230 --> 02:27:46.861
Because you know,

6048
02:27:46.861 --> 02:27:47.031
we're,

6049
02:27:47.031 --> 02:27:49.260
we're so used to just being shit on that were like,

6050
02:27:49.290 --> 02:27:50.123
ah,

6051
02:27:50.220 --> 02:27:51.360
I can't be worth much.

6052
02:27:51.840 --> 02:27:52.890
Well it's that,

6053
02:27:52.891 --> 02:27:53.401
and it's also,

6054
02:27:53.401 --> 02:27:55.920
you're in constantly in the cycle of creating new stuff.

6055
02:27:55.950 --> 02:28:00.920
Like somebody asked me a bit that was on my last special that I just did an

6056
02:28:00.921 --> 02:28:02.580
August and I had to go,

6057
02:28:02.970 --> 02:28:03.650
oh fuck.

6058
02:28:03.650 --> 02:28:04.570
Oh yeah.

6059
02:28:04.590 --> 02:28:06.030
They like said this part.

6060
02:28:06.031 --> 02:28:06.241
I go,

6061
02:28:06.241 --> 02:28:06.691
oh yeah,

6062
02:28:06.691 --> 02:28:07.524
that part.

6063
02:28:07.680 --> 02:28:08.550
Oh Shit.

6064
02:28:08.580 --> 02:28:08.780
Yeah.

6065
02:28:08.780 --> 02:28:09.361
Well that's it.

6066
02:28:09.361 --> 02:28:10.194
That's how it works.

6067
02:28:10.430 --> 02:28:11.263
Cause without that,

6068
02:28:11.400 --> 02:28:13.260
I've abandoned that.

6069
02:28:13.290 --> 02:28:14.250
Like an ex girlfriend.

6070
02:28:14.280 --> 02:28:14.490
Yeah,

6071
02:28:14.490 --> 02:28:14.791
I know.

6072
02:28:14.791 --> 02:28:15.624
Exactly.

6073
02:28:16.140 --> 02:28:16.321
Hey,

6074
02:28:16.321 --> 02:28:17.190
remember when you did this bit?

6075
02:28:17.310 --> 02:28:18.143
I don't,

6076
02:28:18.450 --> 02:28:19.390
but if you tell me I'll,

6077
02:28:19.680 --> 02:28:20.700
it'll jog my memory.

6078
02:28:20.880 --> 02:28:21.040
Well,

6079
02:28:21.040 --> 02:28:22.150
I was laughing

6080
02:28:22.180 --> 02:28:24.250
<v 7>at some of my bits from shiny happy jihad,</v>

6081
02:28:24.251 --> 02:28:25.900
like I had never heard them before.

6082
02:28:26.350 --> 02:28:29.030
And then I re re remembered like after it I go,

6083
02:28:29.080 --> 02:28:29.920
oh yeah,

6084
02:28:29.921 --> 02:28:31.120
that's how that goes.

6085
02:28:31.180 --> 02:28:31.331
Oh,

6086
02:28:31.331 --> 02:28:32.350
that's funny.

6087
02:28:32.620 --> 02:28:35.160
Like I was enjoying it as a fan.

6088
02:28:35.180 --> 02:28:35.741
Spectator.

6089
02:28:35.741 --> 02:28:36.520
Yeah.

6090
02:28:36.520 --> 02:28:38.590
And also like criticizing it.

6091
02:28:38.591 --> 02:28:41.140
Like you can see where there's some dead air or where there some like,

6092
02:28:41.141 --> 02:28:41.470
uh,

6093
02:28:41.470 --> 02:28:43.060
maybe like too verbose.

6094
02:28:43.300 --> 02:28:46.930
Maybe it could have less words or maybe more pause.

6095
02:28:46.931 --> 02:28:47.530
He's always like,

6096
02:28:47.530 --> 02:28:47.681
oh,

6097
02:28:47.681 --> 02:28:48.170
he's little.

6098
02:28:48.170 --> 02:28:48.680
<v 3>We have to all the,</v>

6099
02:28:48.680 --> 02:28:50.480
all the things we all notice and nobody else will.

6100
02:28:50.560 --> 02:28:50.741
<v 7>Yeah.</v>

6101
02:28:50.741 --> 02:28:51.521
But those things,

6102
02:28:51.521 --> 02:28:51.731
man,

6103
02:28:51.731 --> 02:28:52.301
going over,

6104
02:28:52.301 --> 02:28:52.931
stuff like that.

6105
02:28:52.931 --> 02:28:53.320
It's like,

6106
02:28:53.320 --> 02:28:54.340
it's really good for it.

6107
02:28:54.341 --> 02:28:58.990
Like I know for fighters it's one of the best things you could ever do is watch

6108
02:28:58.991 --> 02:28:59.980
yourself spar.

6109
02:29:00.400 --> 02:29:02.860
Like watching yourself spar or watching yourself fight.

6110
02:29:02.861 --> 02:29:07.120
It's very important because you have a very distorted perception of what you

6111
02:29:07.121 --> 02:29:10.270
look like when you're moving around because you're only seeing it out of your

6112
02:29:10.271 --> 02:29:12.430
eyes even if you're looking at yourself in them.

6113
02:29:12.490 --> 02:29:13.840
That's why shadow boxing is important,

6114
02:29:13.841 --> 02:29:14.011
right?

6115
02:29:14.011 --> 02:29:14.380
Yep.

6116
02:29:14.380 --> 02:29:17.170
You got to see what your punches look like when they're coming out,

6117
02:29:17.380 --> 02:29:21.520
but to watch yourself actually compete or at least spar massively,

6118
02:29:21.521 --> 02:29:22.510
massively important.

6119
02:29:22.840 --> 02:29:26.500
We sit to film sparring sessions when I was a kid and I remember like watching

6120
02:29:26.501 --> 02:29:28.060
them like would make you so much better.

6121
02:29:28.061 --> 02:29:28.270
You're like,

6122
02:29:28.270 --> 02:29:28.481
oh,

6123
02:29:28.481 --> 02:29:29.260
I could get hit there.

6124
02:29:29.260 --> 02:29:30.040
Oh look,

6125
02:29:30.040 --> 02:29:30.873
what am I doing there?

6126
02:29:31.180 --> 02:29:32.050
Why is my hand down?

6127
02:29:32.080 --> 02:29:32.231
Yeah.

6128
02:29:32.231 --> 02:29:34.000
You don't even think about it while you're in the middle of doing it.

6129
02:29:34.780 --> 02:29:35.000
<v 3>Hey,</v>

6130
02:29:35.000 --> 02:29:35.731
in your head you're like,

6131
02:29:35.731 --> 02:29:35.941
fuck,

6132
02:29:35.941 --> 02:29:37.110
I'm killing this shit right now.

6133
02:29:37.380 --> 02:29:37.741
And you're like,

6134
02:29:37.741 --> 02:29:38.730
watch it go this way.

6135
02:29:38.731 --> 02:29:40.500
Sloppier than I thought it looked in my head.

6136
02:29:40.860 --> 02:29:42.540
I had painted this beautiful fucking picture.

6137
02:29:42.580 --> 02:29:43.630
<v 7>You did a lot of boxing,</v>

6138
02:29:43.631 --> 02:29:44.080
right?

6139
02:29:44.080 --> 02:29:44.650
Yeah.

6140
02:29:44.650 --> 02:29:47.650
When do you think that like that sort of like having that,

6141
02:29:48.220 --> 02:29:50.560
that really difficult thing to do?

6142
02:29:50.590 --> 02:29:52.850
Like what boxing is like really difficult to get good at.

6143
02:29:52.870 --> 02:29:57.010
Really difficult to like even show up at the gym every day at that like helped

6144
02:29:57.011 --> 02:30:00.310
prepare you in life like that does like a mom,

6145
02:30:00.640 --> 02:30:04.360
like if you look at the average person's like range of difficult things they

6146
02:30:04.361 --> 02:30:06.580
choose to do as a recreation,

6147
02:30:06.581 --> 02:30:08.140
not like go to war or something like that,

6148
02:30:08.141 --> 02:30:09.910
but choose to do as a recreation.

6149
02:30:09.911 --> 02:30:11.740
Boxing is one of the more difficult ones.

6150
02:30:12.550 --> 02:30:13.070
<v 3>But I,</v>

6151
02:30:13.070 --> 02:30:13.610
I,

6152
02:30:13.610 --> 02:30:14.880
I did it out of necessity.

6153
02:30:15.150 --> 02:30:15.690
Really?

6154
02:30:15.690 --> 02:30:15.901
Yeah.

6155
02:30:15.901 --> 02:30:16.920
I needed to,

6156
02:30:17.160 --> 02:30:19.970
I was just a small kid and I,

6157
02:30:19.980 --> 02:30:22.740
and I would get beat up a lot and I was not,

6158
02:30:22.770 --> 02:30:24.870
I was very passive and a,

6159
02:30:24.871 --> 02:30:25.591
when I learned how to,

6160
02:30:25.591 --> 02:30:27.150
it wasn't because I figured if,

6161
02:30:27.151 --> 02:30:27.361
you know,

6162
02:30:27.361 --> 02:30:28.290
if someone's gonna beat me up,

6163
02:30:28.320 --> 02:30:28.681
it's better.

6164
02:30:28.681 --> 02:30:29.431
I don't fight back.

6165
02:30:29.431 --> 02:30:31.920
So the beating ends quicker and I'd go on with my life.

6166
02:30:32.160 --> 02:30:33.750
That's a very Indian way of looking at things.

6167
02:30:33.770 --> 02:30:36.840
And then when my dad made me go and train,

6168
02:30:36.870 --> 02:30:40.810
cause my dad used to box in India and then some guys that I grew up with were

6169
02:30:40.830 --> 02:30:41.311
boxers,

6170
02:30:41.311 --> 02:30:42.390
then two and then I was like,

6171
02:30:42.391 --> 02:30:43.380
they went go train with willy.

6172
02:30:43.381 --> 02:30:44.520
And I went and trained and I was like,

6173
02:30:45.060 --> 02:30:45.893
Oh I,

6174
02:30:45.950 --> 02:30:46.631
this is okay.

6175
02:30:46.631 --> 02:30:47.431
I get it all right.

6176
02:30:47.431 --> 02:30:51.420
And then I started to like it and then I would almost encourage a fight

6177
02:30:51.421 --> 02:30:52.050
sometimes.

6178
02:30:52.050 --> 02:30:52.501
You know what I mean?

6179
02:30:52.501 --> 02:30:53.334
Like really?

6180
02:30:53.460 --> 02:30:55.920
So you think because you look at this,

6181
02:30:55.921 --> 02:30:57.630
that nothing is pop pop,

6182
02:30:57.660 --> 02:30:58.141
you know what I mean?

6183
02:30:58.141 --> 02:30:58.410
You're like,

6184
02:30:58.410 --> 02:30:59.640
Oh did you get a lot of street fights?

6185
02:30:59.910 --> 02:31:00.743
Um,

6186
02:31:01.230 --> 02:31:02.220
nothing crazy.

6187
02:31:02.221 --> 02:31:02.580
But yeah,

6188
02:31:02.580 --> 02:31:06.690
for quite a few I would say it's a great tension release reliever too,

6189
02:31:06.691 --> 02:31:06.871
right?

6190
02:31:06.871 --> 02:31:07.171
It is.

6191
02:31:07.171 --> 02:31:09.790
But I would also get very nervous in street fights because I,

6192
02:31:10.210 --> 02:31:11.100
at the same time,

6193
02:31:11.101 --> 02:31:13.620
I would see this person's confidence level and I'd be like,

6194
02:31:13.650 --> 02:31:13.920
wow,

6195
02:31:13.920 --> 02:31:16.290
they must be like a black belt in everything.

6196
02:31:16.710 --> 02:31:17.401
You know what I mean?

6197
02:31:17.401 --> 02:31:17.880
And then,

6198
02:31:17.880 --> 02:31:19.980
then you see them throw a punch and oh it's fucking

6199
02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:20.250
<v 2>idiot.</v>

6200
02:31:20.250 --> 02:31:21.120
Pop good night.

6201
02:31:21.390 --> 02:31:23.310
It is weird when you watch people street fight,

6202
02:31:23.311 --> 02:31:27.150
if you watch like a brawl outside of a club like [inaudible] guys so confident

6203
02:31:27.151 --> 02:31:28.160
that you would be willing to get out,

6204
02:31:28.570 --> 02:31:29.230
cause you don't know,

6205
02:31:29.230 --> 02:31:30.300
you have no idea what you're doing.

6206
02:31:30.390 --> 02:31:35.220
Winging these luck and windmill punches and that's why when you listen like boss

6207
02:31:35.221 --> 02:31:36.120
route and stories,

6208
02:31:36.180 --> 02:31:37.230
they're so hilarious.

6209
02:31:37.440 --> 02:31:40.440
Like you want to talk about [inaudible] shirt today?

6210
02:31:41.760 --> 02:31:42.181
Which one?

6211
02:31:42.181 --> 02:31:42.910
The pancreas.

6212
02:31:42.910 --> 02:31:43.620
Your pancreas.

6213
02:31:43.620 --> 02:31:43.830
Yeah,

6214
02:31:43.830 --> 02:31:44.540
I've got that.

6215
02:31:44.540 --> 02:31:47.250
Those roots of fight shirts are dope.

6216
02:31:47.251 --> 02:31:47.700
Is Fun.

6217
02:31:47.700 --> 02:31:48.301
The roots of fight,

6218
02:31:48.301 --> 02:31:48.950
sweat pants.

6219
02:31:48.950 --> 02:31:49.783
These

6220
02:31:50.710 --> 02:31:52.650
you going to full roots of fight wardrobe.

6221
02:31:52.890 --> 02:31:54.390
Jesse cats is rolling in his,

6222
02:31:54.391 --> 02:31:54.960
uh,

6223
02:31:54.960 --> 02:31:55.890
his PJ's right now.

6224
02:31:55.930 --> 02:31:56.391
Jesse,

6225
02:31:56.391 --> 02:31:57.870
Jesse reach out to Jesse.

6226
02:31:57.930 --> 02:31:58.800
Big Shout to Jesse.

6227
02:31:58.870 --> 02:31:58.980
He's,

6228
02:31:58.980 --> 02:31:59.220
he,

6229
02:31:59.220 --> 02:31:59.751
it's got a great,

6230
02:31:59.751 --> 02:32:00.810
it's great tee shirt company.

6231
02:32:00.900 --> 02:32:01.230
Yeah.

6232
02:32:01.230 --> 02:32:02.340
They have amazing stuff,

6233
02:32:02.341 --> 02:32:02.680
you know,

6234
02:32:02.680 --> 02:32:05.110
and gave me a really dope Jack Johnson one who is my favorite photo.

6235
02:32:05.120 --> 02:32:05.820
I've got that.

6236
02:32:05.820 --> 02:32:07.430
Is it the Galveston giant guy?

6237
02:32:07.510 --> 02:32:08.343
He's got his hands.

6238
02:32:09.050 --> 02:32:11.420
Do you know he was only like six to he,

6239
02:32:11.560 --> 02:32:16.560
but it's risks and risks like 13 inches or 14 inches or something like that was

6240
02:32:16.621 --> 02:32:17.454
a giant bag.

6241
02:32:17.470 --> 02:32:19.560
That was a fucking huge wrist on a human being.

6242
02:32:19.561 --> 02:32:19.710
Let me,

6243
02:32:19.710 --> 02:32:20.250
Sam,

6244
02:32:20.250 --> 02:32:20.911
I think I'm riding,

6245
02:32:20.911 --> 02:32:22.110
I'm thinking it's Jack Johnson.

6246
02:32:22.111 --> 02:32:22.530
The boxer.

6247
02:32:22.530 --> 02:32:23.850
I think it does five.

6248
02:32:24.060 --> 02:32:24.361
I mean,

6249
02:32:24.361 --> 02:32:25.500
I think it's a six.

6250
02:32:25.540 --> 02:32:26.041
A six.

6251
02:32:26.041 --> 02:32:27.240
I think he was six even,

6252
02:32:27.241 --> 02:32:28.074
wasn't he?

6253
02:32:28.440 --> 02:32:29.273
Yeah,

6254
02:32:29.820 --> 02:32:30.900
I think he's a little taller than that.

6255
02:32:31.080 --> 02:32:33.510
I think he was like kind of legitimately,

6256
02:32:33.960 --> 02:32:35.040
legitimately tall,

6257
02:32:35.730 --> 02:32:38.640
but they called him the Galveston giant six feet.

6258
02:32:38.641 --> 02:32:39.474
You're right.

6259
02:32:39.480 --> 02:32:41.040
Six feet and a half inch.

6260
02:32:41.130 --> 02:32:42.510
That was a giant pack then.

6261
02:32:42.590 --> 02:32:43.140
Yup.

6262
02:32:43.140 --> 02:32:44.010
Wow.

6263
02:32:44.040 --> 02:32:45.600
That's so crazy.

6264
02:32:45.601 --> 02:32:45.990
Risks.

6265
02:32:45.990 --> 02:32:46.823
What was his wrist?

6266
02:32:47.370 --> 02:32:48.001
I don't know.

6267
02:32:48.001 --> 02:32:49.410
I'm looking at Wikipedia.

6268
02:32:50.010 --> 02:32:50.700
Um,

6269
02:32:50.700 --> 02:32:51.870
that is crazy.

6270
02:32:52.320 --> 02:32:56.070
He was only six feet tall and they called them the Galveston giant and he was a

6271
02:32:56.071 --> 02:32:57.540
defensive master.

6272
02:32:57.720 --> 02:32:59.400
Oh he was such a good boxer for the time.

6273
02:32:59.760 --> 02:33:02.100
But here's also like such a knockout puncher.

6274
02:33:02.430 --> 02:33:02.670
Yeah.

6275
02:33:02.670 --> 02:33:03.810
He would hold guys up.

6276
02:33:04.140 --> 02:33:07.650
He would hit you see your knees buckled and jump in and hold you up so that he

6277
02:33:07.651 --> 02:33:08.880
could abuse you a little bit longer.

6278
02:33:09.230 --> 02:33:11.760
It's really interesting watching those old fights man.

6279
02:33:11.820 --> 02:33:13.230
Really fucking interesting.

6280
02:33:13.440 --> 02:33:15.860
Such a different style of a,

6281
02:33:15.861 --> 02:33:20.370
of fighting with those little gloves and long and the way they moved it was very

6282
02:33:20.371 --> 02:33:21.204
archaic.

6283
02:33:21.300 --> 02:33:21.721
Yeah.

6284
02:33:21.721 --> 02:33:25.080
So archaic like you compare him to like how may were there moves like

6285
02:33:25.110 --> 02:33:25.770
Mayweather,

6286
02:33:25.770 --> 02:33:30.770
like I think is one of like people don't like him because he talks so much shit

6287
02:33:30.781 --> 02:33:33.030
and because sometimes he doesn't knock guys out.

6288
02:33:33.031 --> 02:33:33.930
Just wins by decision.

6289
02:33:33.931 --> 02:33:36.390
But as far as like technique and skill,

6290
02:33:36.510 --> 02:33:38.380
technically boxers ever,

6291
02:33:39.070 --> 02:33:39.630
ever.

6292
02:33:39.630 --> 02:33:39.961
I,

6293
02:33:39.961 --> 02:33:40.231
you know,

6294
02:33:40.231 --> 02:33:44.610
I think a really any either really interesting fight or really boring fight

6295
02:33:44.611 --> 02:33:46.110
would've been him versus pronounced Whitaker.

6296
02:33:46.380 --> 02:33:47.213
Oh yeah.

6297
02:33:48.030 --> 02:33:53.010
Cornell was like the Mayweather of the his time as far as fighting style goes.

6298
02:33:53.310 --> 02:33:53.941
Yeah.

6299
02:33:53.941 --> 02:33:55.230
How's he doing these days?

6300
02:33:55.290 --> 02:33:56.670
He's a little fucked up I think.

6301
02:33:57.350 --> 02:33:58.560
I think it's training guys and he was like,

6302
02:33:58.561 --> 02:33:59.220
he was,

6303
02:33:59.220 --> 02:34:00.960
he had a drug problem for a minute.

6304
02:34:00.961 --> 02:34:02.190
I don't know if he's over that or not,

6305
02:34:02.191 --> 02:34:04.830
but it's so hard watching your,

6306
02:34:05.210 --> 02:34:05.460
your,

6307
02:34:05.460 --> 02:34:05.970
you know,

6308
02:34:05.970 --> 02:34:08.180
the heroes of your youth sporting year.

6309
02:34:08.430 --> 02:34:11.040
Just be debilitated as older men now.

6310
02:34:12.300 --> 02:34:12.751
You know,

6311
02:34:12.751 --> 02:34:14.140
you've seen it with football lot,

6312
02:34:14.160 --> 02:34:14.971
you're seeing it with everything,

6313
02:34:14.971 --> 02:34:15.271
but man,

6314
02:34:15.271 --> 02:34:18.190
with boxing it takes on a special special,

6315
02:34:18.190 --> 02:34:18.971
<v 4>a form,</v>

6316
02:34:18.971 --> 02:34:19.420
you know?

6317
02:34:19.420 --> 02:34:19.780
Yeah.

6318
02:34:19.780 --> 02:34:20.890
It's one of those things where you're like,

6319
02:34:20.891 --> 02:34:21.071
oh,

6320
02:34:21.071 --> 02:34:22.060
that could have been fucking,

6321
02:34:22.360 --> 02:34:23.230
that could be any guy.

6322
02:34:23.231 --> 02:34:26.020
I know we were talking about de la Hoya last night.

6323
02:34:26.320 --> 02:34:28.240
The day has is looking in his eyes always.

6324
02:34:28.241 --> 02:34:29.530
Who's about to relapse?

6325
02:34:29.560 --> 02:34:30.430
Like at any second,

6326
02:34:30.940 --> 02:34:33.160
he always has a nervous twitch in his eyes.

6327
02:34:33.190 --> 02:34:34.023
You know,

6328
02:34:34.670 --> 02:34:36.580
like somebody's going to find something out about him.

6329
02:34:37.660 --> 02:34:38.980
Just that look of what do you know

6330
02:34:40.690 --> 02:34:42.370
what you think of the photos that were out?

6331
02:34:42.371 --> 02:34:45.700
I mean in his macho world of not just a boxer,

6332
02:34:45.701 --> 02:34:46.750
world champion boxer,

6333
02:34:46.751 --> 02:34:48.280
but Mexican,

6334
02:34:48.820 --> 02:34:49.221
you know,

6335
02:34:49.221 --> 02:34:49.390
like,

6336
02:34:49.390 --> 02:34:52.420
and then to not be accepted by the hood guys.

6337
02:34:52.510 --> 02:34:53.200
Yup.

6338
02:34:53.200 --> 02:34:53.591
And you know,

6339
02:34:53.591 --> 02:34:55.330
it's not like he came from like fucking,

6340
02:34:55.331 --> 02:34:55.750
you know,

6341
02:34:55.750 --> 02:34:56.441
Woodland Hills.

6342
02:34:56.441 --> 02:34:57.380
He came from the hood too.

6343
02:34:57.560 --> 02:34:58.570
He's from east La.

6344
02:34:58.670 --> 02:34:59.230
Yeah.

6345
02:34:59.230 --> 02:35:04.230
But then to have that and then photos of him with fucking fishnet stockings on

6346
02:35:05.561 --> 02:35:06.370
high heels.

6347
02:35:06.370 --> 02:35:08.380
That never helps you hanging out with hot Russians.

6348
02:35:08.590 --> 02:35:08.950
Yeah.

6349
02:35:08.950 --> 02:35:09.431
That's a hot,

6350
02:35:09.431 --> 02:35:10.001
that pitch was,

6351
02:35:10.001 --> 02:35:11.080
she got an wore stockings.

6352
02:35:11.081 --> 02:35:11.240
Yeah.

6353
02:35:11.240 --> 02:35:12.130
See you can't do that.

6354
02:35:12.131 --> 02:35:12.301
I've,

6355
02:35:12.301 --> 02:35:12.480
I've,

6356
02:35:12.480 --> 02:35:13.990
I've put pantyhose on my dick before.

6357
02:35:14.050 --> 02:35:15.400
Did you know,

6358
02:35:15.490 --> 02:35:18.070
like she took him off in a wrapped around my deck and I was wondering why did

6359
02:35:18.071 --> 02:35:18.730
you do that?

6360
02:35:18.730 --> 02:35:19.660
They have a foot fetish.

6361
02:35:19.870 --> 02:35:20.020
Do.

6362
02:35:20.020 --> 02:35:20.420
Yeah.

6363
02:35:20.420 --> 02:35:21.040
Yeah.

6364
02:35:21.040 --> 02:35:21.880
I can do this already.

6365
02:35:22.540 --> 02:35:22.601
Oh,

6366
02:35:22.601 --> 02:35:23.860
you were talking about feet last night.

6367
02:35:23.950 --> 02:35:24.420
That's right.

6368
02:35:24.420 --> 02:35:25.253
Women's.

6369
02:35:25.650 --> 02:35:26.483
Exactly.

6370
02:35:26.630 --> 02:35:26.800
Yeah.

6371
02:35:26.800 --> 02:35:28.420
Is there a dude out there with a dude foot fetish?

6372
02:35:28.450 --> 02:35:29.050
That'd be fucking,

6373
02:35:29.050 --> 02:35:29.530
yeah.

6374
02:35:29.530 --> 02:35:30.140
There must be.

6375
02:35:30.140 --> 02:35:30.970
Why even ask?

6376
02:35:30.970 --> 02:35:33.100
There must be knee fetishes,

6377
02:35:33.160 --> 02:35:35.410
shoulder fetishes with others.

6378
02:35:35.740 --> 02:35:36.491
There's all kinds of,

6379
02:35:36.491 --> 02:35:37.330
you give an extremity,

6380
02:35:37.331 --> 02:35:39.310
there's a fetish for 7 billion people.

6381
02:35:39.400 --> 02:35:40.233
Right?

6382
02:35:40.510 --> 02:35:41.800
There's gotta be a elbow.

6383
02:35:43.930 --> 02:35:44.763
Yeah,

6384
02:35:44.830 --> 02:35:45.201
I did it.

6385
02:35:45.201 --> 02:35:46.430
A hot chick with thicker angles.

6386
02:35:46.960 --> 02:35:48.110
Frankel's shit.

6387
02:35:48.160 --> 02:35:50.110
Big Ass ankles built.

6388
02:35:50.500 --> 02:35:51.340
I'm not mad at them.

6389
02:35:51.341 --> 02:35:51.910
You know,

6390
02:35:51.910 --> 02:35:52.250
probably.

6391
02:35:52.250 --> 02:35:55.270
Pardon the inner tall hot neanderthal pussy.

6392
02:35:56.350 --> 02:35:57.250
A lot of those Europeans,

6393
02:35:57.251 --> 02:35:58.420
they've got neanderthal genes.

6394
02:35:58.660 --> 02:35:59.110
They do.

6395
02:35:59.110 --> 02:35:59.471
They do.

6396
02:35:59.471 --> 02:35:59.681
You know,

6397
02:35:59.681 --> 02:36:00.514
but all that,

6398
02:36:00.830 --> 02:36:01.401
they do that.

6399
02:36:01.401 --> 02:36:02.290
I can understand that.

6400
02:36:02.920 --> 02:36:03.011
Well,

6401
02:36:03.011 --> 02:36:03.821
that's where they would come from,

6402
02:36:03.821 --> 02:36:04.654
right?

6403
02:36:04.890 --> 02:36:05.620
Yeah.

6404
02:36:05.620 --> 02:36:06.453
I think,

6405
02:36:07.090 --> 02:36:07.301
well,

6406
02:36:07.301 --> 02:36:07.781
France,

6407
02:36:07.781 --> 02:36:08.081
right?

6408
02:36:08.081 --> 02:36:11.260
Wasn't that part of a France where they discovered the first neanderthal?

6409
02:36:11.500 --> 02:36:12.130
That's what they call it.

6410
02:36:12.130 --> 02:36:13.930
Neander tall and feel like sophisticated.

6411
02:36:14.320 --> 02:36:14.560
Yeah.

6412
02:36:14.560 --> 02:36:16.590
You don't say Thall neanderthal social,

6413
02:36:16.650 --> 02:36:17.620
say the Thames River.

6414
02:36:17.980 --> 02:36:18.101
Oh,

6415
02:36:18.101 --> 02:36:18.670
do you?

6416
02:36:18.670 --> 02:36:19.630
I don't even know how to say that.

6417
02:36:19.780 --> 02:36:20.613
Not The fames.

6418
02:36:20.770 --> 02:36:21.191
Oh really?

6419
02:36:21.191 --> 02:36:21.491
It's t.

6420
02:36:21.491 --> 02:36:24.780
H.

6421
02:36:24.780 --> 02:36:24.780
A.

6422
02:36:24.780 --> 02:36:24.780
M.

6423
02:36:24.780 --> 02:36:24.780
A.

6424
02:36:24.780 --> 02:36:24.780
T.

6425
02:36:24.780 --> 02:36:24.780
H.

6426
02:36:24.780 --> 02:36:24.780
A.

6427
02:36:24.780 --> 02:36:24.780
M.

6428
02:36:24.780 --> 02:36:24.780
E.

6429
02:36:24.780 --> 02:36:24.780
S.

6430
02:36:24.780 --> 02:36:25.613
English.

6431
02:36:25.970 --> 02:36:26.380
English.

6432
02:36:26.380 --> 02:36:27.213
A tricky spot.

6433
02:36:27.460 --> 02:36:28.840
How did you get to be so famous in England?

6434
02:36:29.140 --> 02:36:30.040
It's all youtube shit.

6435
02:36:30.400 --> 02:36:30.880
Uh,

6436
02:36:30.880 --> 02:36:32.860
I used to be there all the time in the nineties.

6437
02:36:33.210 --> 02:36:33.760
Oh really?

6438
02:36:33.760 --> 02:36:34.870
Doing like the comedy clubs,

6439
02:36:34.871 --> 02:36:35.810
comedy store there.

6440
02:36:35.820 --> 02:36:37.180
La Junglers,

6441
02:36:37.181 --> 02:36:37.961
the glee club,

6442
02:36:37.961 --> 02:36:38.420
all that.

6443
02:36:38.420 --> 02:36:41.020
I fucking huge boom in the 90s.

6444
02:36:41.021 --> 02:36:42.070
And I was there for it.

6445
02:36:42.880 --> 02:36:43.400
And just,

6446
02:36:43.400 --> 02:36:44.560
you did 20 minutes spots.

6447
02:36:44.561 --> 02:36:46.390
It's all you would do really.

6448
02:36:46.540 --> 02:36:47.230
And you would,

6449
02:36:47.230 --> 02:36:49.000
you'd get paid in pounds and it was great money.

6450
02:36:49.001 --> 02:36:52.870
And you could do like fucking four shows a night and get paid on each one of

6451
02:36:52.871 --> 02:36:55.030
them because they have an agreement with the comedy store.

6452
02:36:55.570 --> 02:36:55.790
No,

6453
02:36:55.790 --> 02:36:57.160
they do not jack name.

6454
02:36:57.161 --> 02:36:58.030
They jacked the name.

6455
02:36:58.031 --> 02:36:58.864
The logo.

6456
02:36:59.140 --> 02:37:00.280
The logo is the same.

6457
02:37:00.430 --> 02:37:01.000
Yeah.

6458
02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:01.833
Whoa.

6459
02:37:02.170 --> 02:37:03.930
There's nothing you can do about it cause it's another country.

6460
02:37:04.510 --> 02:37:07.090
There was some sort of weird thing where like they got away with it.

6461
02:37:07.270 --> 02:37:08.110
That's hilarious.

6462
02:37:08.140 --> 02:37:09.700
Does the comedy store in Sydney too?

6463
02:37:10.090 --> 02:37:11.380
There's one in India as well.

6464
02:37:11.530 --> 02:37:12.363
Really?

6465
02:37:12.400 --> 02:37:14.110
There's a comedy store in India?

6466
02:37:14.170 --> 02:37:14.890
Yeah,

6467
02:37:14.890 --> 02:37:15.261
there's lot.

6468
02:37:15.261 --> 02:37:15.500
Again,

6469
02:37:15.500 --> 02:37:16.040
it's based

6470
02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:17.000
<v 2>out of the one in London.</v>

6471
02:37:17.420 --> 02:37:21.740
Oh son of a bitch is going International Jackman name and then go international

6472
02:37:21.741 --> 02:37:22.250
with it.

6473
02:37:22.250 --> 02:37:26.460
Motherfuckers now when they do comedy in England or in a,

6474
02:37:26.461 --> 02:37:29.870
in India rather or they do an English version for the most part.

6475
02:37:29.900 --> 02:37:30.590
Really?

6476
02:37:30.590 --> 02:37:31.250
Yeah,

6477
02:37:31.250 --> 02:37:34.460
so there's that many people that are English speaking and he figured there's a

6478
02:37:34.461 --> 02:37:38.990
1.3 billion people there if fucking 1% of the population speaks English.

6479
02:37:38.991 --> 02:37:39.560
You're good.

6480
02:37:39.560 --> 02:37:41.690
How much bigger is India than the United States?

6481
02:37:42.230 --> 02:37:44.630
Geographically or geographically?

6482
02:37:44.690 --> 02:37:46.460
I don't think it's much bigger.

6483
02:37:47.510 --> 02:37:47.840
It is.

6484
02:37:47.840 --> 02:37:52.840
It's a sub continent so that means there's like four times as many people in the

6485
02:37:53.511 --> 02:37:54.344
same spot.

6486
02:37:54.380 --> 02:37:54.681
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

6487
02:37:54.681 --> 02:37:58.280
like you go to a city like Bombay and there's probably 30 million people,

6488
02:37:58.700 --> 02:38:01.220
which is the population of California in a city.

6489
02:38:01.580 --> 02:38:03.080
How often do you go there and perform?

6490
02:38:03.250 --> 02:38:04.160
A once every two years.

6491
02:38:04.161 --> 02:38:05.510
I'm going back in June next month,

6492
02:38:05.600 --> 02:38:06.141
February.

6493
02:38:06.141 --> 02:38:06.591
I think I'll be there.

6494
02:38:06.591 --> 02:38:07.580
I'll be there on Valentine's Day.

6495
02:38:07.581 --> 02:38:08.414
Matter of fact,

6496
02:38:08.560 --> 02:38:11.570
how romantic I know I'm going to go to Bollywood and hang with the stars.

6497
02:38:11.690 --> 02:38:12.980
I will be in Bollywood,

6498
02:38:14.150 --> 02:38:14.661
Bollywood.

6499
02:38:14.661 --> 02:38:15.494
Like what does that,

6500
02:38:15.760 --> 02:38:16.593
it's just the name

6501
02:38:16.650 --> 02:38:18.650
<v 2>for Bombay's.</v>

6502
02:38:18.660 --> 02:38:19.680
Hollywood is all the things,

6503
02:38:19.681 --> 02:38:22.470
but is it the same sort of seen as like the Hollywood out here?

6504
02:38:22.650 --> 02:38:23.011
I mean,

6505
02:38:23.011 --> 02:38:23.791
you tries to be,

6506
02:38:23.791 --> 02:38:24.091
you know,

6507
02:38:24.091 --> 02:38:25.380
it's a little more,

6508
02:38:26.480 --> 02:38:26.771
<v 3>it's,</v>

6509
02:38:26.771 --> 02:38:27.020
it's,

6510
02:38:27.020 --> 02:38:27.670
it's every,

6511
02:38:27.670 --> 02:38:27.891
you know,

6512
02:38:27.891 --> 02:38:31.880
when somebody thinks something is some way and then that's how they portray it

6513
02:38:31.910 --> 02:38:33.680
as opposed to it actually being one way.

6514
02:38:33.830 --> 02:38:34.430
Right.

6515
02:38:34.430 --> 02:38:37.340
It's more that this is what we think you guys are doing.

6516
02:38:37.390 --> 02:38:38.030
All right.

6517
02:38:38.030 --> 02:38:38.481
Oh,

6518
02:38:38.481 --> 02:38:39.050
I see.

6519
02:38:39.050 --> 02:38:42.440
So it's like they're posing.

6520
02:38:42.820 --> 02:38:43.550
Yeah,

6521
02:38:43.550 --> 02:38:46.700
there's a lot of disingenuous,

6522
02:38:46.701 --> 02:38:47.534
um,

6523
02:38:48.230 --> 02:38:49.063
uh,

6524
02:38:49.280 --> 02:38:50.690
likes and stuff over there.

6525
02:38:50.691 --> 02:38:50.931
You know,

6526
02:38:50.931 --> 02:38:51.500
it's kind of like,

6527
02:38:51.500 --> 02:38:51.591
oh,

6528
02:38:51.591 --> 02:38:52.580
this is the hot thing,

6529
02:38:53.170 --> 02:38:54.170
this is what's good.

6530
02:38:54.230 --> 02:38:54.800
And you're like,

6531
02:38:54.800 --> 02:38:54.920
yeah,

6532
02:38:54.920 --> 02:38:56.210
but you don't really like it.

6533
02:38:56.240 --> 02:38:57.710
You don't really understand it.

6534
02:38:58.040 --> 02:38:59.900
You don't understand the origins of it.

6535
02:38:59.901 --> 02:39:00.111
Like,

6536
02:39:00.111 --> 02:39:00.680
you know,

6537
02:39:00.680 --> 02:39:02.300
it's whatever's hot is what's hot.

6538
02:39:02.680 --> 02:39:04.820
It's like von Dutch hats.

6539
02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:05.801
It's like a,

6540
02:39:05.801 --> 02:39:06.290
it's like,

6541
02:39:06.290 --> 02:39:08.750
it's like ed hardy had already,

6542
02:39:08.930 --> 02:39:09.230
I mean,

6543
02:39:09.230 --> 02:39:09.381
oh,

6544
02:39:09.381 --> 02:39:10.310
this is everybody's wearing this,

6545
02:39:10.610 --> 02:39:11.870
but nobody likes it.

6546
02:39:12.250 --> 02:39:12.490
Well,

6547
02:39:12.490 --> 02:39:13.580
why are you fucking wearing it?

6548
02:39:13.700 --> 02:39:17.630
<v 2>Some people used to look at what ed hardy used to be was a classic American</v>

6549
02:39:17.631 --> 02:39:18.770
style of tattooing.

6550
02:39:18.880 --> 02:39:19.250
Right.

6551
02:39:19.250 --> 02:39:19.941
Like that was,

6552
02:39:19.941 --> 02:39:21.350
that was the whole thing about it.

6553
02:39:21.380 --> 02:39:22.280
The sailor tattoos.

6554
02:39:22.281 --> 02:39:22.731
Yeah.

6555
02:39:22.731 --> 02:39:23.121
Those,

6556
02:39:23.121 --> 02:39:27.110
those Americana sorta like really kind of like shitty drawings.

6557
02:39:27.111 --> 02:39:27.944
Really know what it is.

6558
02:39:28.290 --> 02:39:29.180
They're kind of shitty.

6559
02:39:29.310 --> 02:39:30.143
Yeah,

6560
02:39:30.620 --> 02:39:31.370
yeah,

6561
02:39:31.370 --> 02:39:31.611
yeah.

6562
02:39:31.611 --> 02:39:32.031
Well the,

6563
02:39:32.031 --> 02:39:32.380
you know,

6564
02:39:32.380 --> 02:39:34.070
the anchors and all that kind of stuff.

6565
02:39:34.071 --> 02:39:34.881
Tiger faces,

6566
02:39:34.881 --> 02:39:36.230
they don't really look like tigers.

6567
02:39:36.590 --> 02:39:39.080
But then somehow or another that became cool.

6568
02:39:39.260 --> 02:39:42.950
Like now that I've seen some really good versions of those tattoos,

6569
02:39:43.250 --> 02:39:47.420
but then it became a like a shirt company and everybody was wearing it for like

6570
02:39:47.421 --> 02:39:51.200
two years and then the Christian Hud did ga whenever the fuck that shit was too.

6571
02:39:52.240 --> 02:39:53.073
Yeah.

6572
02:39:53.540 --> 02:39:55.250
That's the guy who created at hardy,

6573
02:39:55.251 --> 02:39:55.430
right,

6574
02:39:55.430 --> 02:39:55.850
isn't it?

6575
02:39:55.850 --> 02:39:56.683
Yeah.

6576
02:39:56.780 --> 02:39:58.030
I had a Christian Azure,

6577
02:39:58.120 --> 02:40:00.800
this shirt and then affliction jumped on it.

6578
02:40:01.190 --> 02:40:01.341
Well,

6579
02:40:01.341 --> 02:40:02.660
they got really Scully.

6580
02:40:03.140 --> 02:40:03.621
Yeah.

6581
02:40:03.621 --> 02:40:03.860
And like,

6582
02:40:03.860 --> 02:40:07.400
like all like dad did destruction these to pay me.

6583
02:40:08.390 --> 02:40:13.290
I used to wear affliction shirts for the UFC where affliction like while was

6584
02:40:13.291 --> 02:40:16.290
doing the broadcasting and had like a little small affliction logo.

6585
02:40:16.440 --> 02:40:16.890
Yeah.

6586
02:40:16.890 --> 02:40:21.000
But that was when my friend Tom was Tom Atencio who uh,

6587
02:40:21.510 --> 02:40:23.850
he was like one of the owners and they kicked him out.

6588
02:40:23.851 --> 02:40:24.720
So I stopped wearing it.

6589
02:40:26.040 --> 02:40:26.191
Yeah.

6590
02:40:26.191 --> 02:40:28.470
They had like six or whatever you want turn dispute and the other guy.

6591
02:40:28.500 --> 02:40:28.980
Yeah.

6592
02:40:28.980 --> 02:40:30.990
Well now I wear tailored shoots.

6593
02:40:31.050 --> 02:40:33.600
Suits that Fox gets me or that the UFC gets,

6594
02:40:33.601 --> 02:40:35.040
but I have noticed it cleaned up a lot.

6595
02:40:35.270 --> 02:40:35.471
Yeah.

6596
02:40:35.471 --> 02:40:36.304
I'm beautiful.

6597
02:40:37.050 --> 02:40:37.883
Beautiful Man.

6598
02:40:38.790 --> 02:40:39.480
Those uh,

6599
02:40:39.480 --> 02:40:40.740
tailored shirts,

6600
02:40:40.741 --> 02:40:41.161
are they,

6601
02:40:41.161 --> 02:40:43.930
they're comfortable where like tailored pants because they fit you,

6602
02:40:44.490 --> 02:40:45.450
they're made for you.

6603
02:40:45.451 --> 02:40:46.230
Exactly.

6604
02:40:46.230 --> 02:40:48.690
They're not made for a guy around this size.

6605
02:40:49.260 --> 02:40:49.501
Yeah.

6606
02:40:49.501 --> 02:40:51.120
Most people can buy like regular clothes,

6607
02:40:51.121 --> 02:40:52.580
but I have to buy a troll clothes.

6608
02:40:52.750 --> 02:40:55.470
I have to be trolled troll like physique.

6609
02:40:55.740 --> 02:40:55.951
Yeah.

6610
02:40:55.951 --> 02:40:59.010
I mean you've got broad shoulders of thick neck and then a short torso.

6611
02:40:59.040 --> 02:40:59.880
It's really the legs,

6612
02:40:59.970 --> 02:41:00.750
the real issue.

6613
02:41:00.750 --> 02:41:01.411
I get strongly,

6614
02:41:01.411 --> 02:41:05.430
I carry all my weight and run my dick bag all around the trunk.

6615
02:41:05.670 --> 02:41:05.851
Yeah,

6616
02:41:05.851 --> 02:41:06.661
trunk and my Dick.

6617
02:41:06.661 --> 02:41:07.980
But I got skinny Indian legs.

6618
02:41:09.470 --> 02:41:10.680
I got skinny boxer legs.

6619
02:41:10.681 --> 02:41:12.480
They would notice boxers never have big legs.

6620
02:41:12.540 --> 02:41:13.560
Tyson that hugely.

6621
02:41:13.590 --> 02:41:13.711
Yeah,

6622
02:41:13.711 --> 02:41:14.550
he had big calves.

6623
02:41:14.790 --> 02:41:16.830
That's where the all the power punchers have big legs.

6624
02:41:16.831 --> 02:41:17.370
Yeah.

6625
02:41:17.370 --> 02:41:18.210
Manny Pacquiao,

6626
02:41:18.540 --> 02:41:19.410
giant calves.

6627
02:41:19.590 --> 02:41:21.900
That's also bad in boxing isn't,

6628
02:41:21.960 --> 02:41:26.230
you don't want to have to muscular of a cab because you can develop compartment

6629
02:41:26.231 --> 02:41:28.830
syndrome where you are because you're on the balls of your feet the whole time

6630
02:41:28.831 --> 02:41:29.664
your muscles tense up.

6631
02:41:30.300 --> 02:41:31.950
They could lock up on your debilitating,

6632
02:41:32.160 --> 02:41:33.450
it doesn't seem to bother Manny.

6633
02:41:33.630 --> 02:41:34.021
No,

6634
02:41:34.021 --> 02:41:37.020
I mean he's pretty flat footed but he bounces flat foot.

6635
02:41:37.060 --> 02:41:37.590
Do you know what I mean?

6636
02:41:37.590 --> 02:41:40.560
So well he moved so well as fucking hard.

6637
02:41:40.590 --> 02:41:44.020
They did a study on many pack yells skeleton and they,

6638
02:41:44.110 --> 02:41:47.790
they noticed that he has like are extraordinarily thick wrist and they were

6639
02:41:47.791 --> 02:41:51.360
equating that to a punching power and they were saying like what's one of the

6640
02:41:51.361 --> 02:41:53.550
ways he punches so unusually hard.

6641
02:41:53.551 --> 02:41:57.520
It has to do with the size of his bones and the size of his risk of the density

6642
02:41:57.540 --> 02:42:02.540
makes it a more solid as opposed to a pinpointed pool cue type of shot.

6643
02:42:02.880 --> 02:42:04.650
That's a weird thing about boxers.

6644
02:42:04.800 --> 02:42:07.830
Like there's like you look at their physique and you'd go,

6645
02:42:07.831 --> 02:42:09.510
well that guy looks like really strong.

6646
02:42:09.511 --> 02:42:11.130
It looks like you'd probably punch is pretty hard.

6647
02:42:11.580 --> 02:42:12.480
But no.

6648
02:42:12.510 --> 02:42:16.410
Sometimes guys are really well built and they can't punch hard.

6649
02:42:16.430 --> 02:42:16.830
Yeah.

6650
02:42:16.830 --> 02:42:18.660
And then there's other guys that have a lot,

6651
02:42:18.670 --> 02:42:20.010
it depends where the weight is.

6652
02:42:20.010 --> 02:42:20.843
Right.

6653
02:42:21.090 --> 02:42:22.950
And which Tyson was short and stocky.

6654
02:42:22.951 --> 02:42:23.271
So it was a,

6655
02:42:23.271 --> 02:42:25.310
it was a lot of explosive power in there.

6656
02:42:25.320 --> 02:42:25.530
Yeah.

6657
02:42:25.530 --> 02:42:27.540
But he looked like a guy that could punch hard.

6658
02:42:27.570 --> 02:42:27.870
Yeah.

6659
02:42:27.870 --> 02:42:28.681
And he had those legs.

6660
02:42:28.681 --> 02:42:30.300
That's where your power comes from in the first place.

6661
02:42:30.660 --> 02:42:30.851
Or,

6662
02:42:30.851 --> 02:42:33.270
but like Andy Lee pref example,

6663
02:42:33.271 --> 02:42:33.451
you know,

6664
02:42:33.451 --> 02:42:34.650
the Irish guy would just one,

6665
02:42:35.010 --> 02:42:35.581
what did he win?

6666
02:42:35.581 --> 02:42:37.440
What titles I'm middleweight title is,

6667
02:42:37.470 --> 02:42:37.741
yeah,

6668
02:42:37.741 --> 02:42:38.574
I believe so.

6669
02:42:38.610 --> 02:42:39.990
He's got a vicious right hook.

6670
02:42:40.030 --> 02:42:40.950
Just vicious.

6671
02:42:41.190 --> 02:42:43.980
But you look at him and he looks like a regular guy.

6672
02:42:44.010 --> 02:42:46.410
Like Gennady Golovkin perfect example.

6673
02:42:46.440 --> 02:42:47.550
He looks like nothing.

6674
02:42:47.640 --> 02:42:47.801
Well,

6675
02:42:47.801 --> 02:42:49.760
he's built kind of these,

6676
02:42:49.980 --> 02:42:51.090
it looks athletic,

6677
02:42:51.240 --> 02:42:53.700
but the way he punches just fucking murderers.

6678
02:42:53.730 --> 02:42:53.911
Yeah.

6679
02:42:53.911 --> 02:42:54.660
You know,

6680
02:42:54.660 --> 02:42:55.860
like Julian Jackson.

6681
02:42:55.920 --> 02:42:56.820
I remember Julian Jackson,

6682
02:42:57.060 --> 02:42:57.990
Virgin Islands.

6683
02:42:58.050 --> 02:42:58.890
Good Lord.

6684
02:42:58.891 --> 02:43:00.510
Could that Guy Punch hard rock and hit?

6685
02:43:00.511 --> 02:43:03.300
But he also had that he had an Adonis like body Donna's like,

6686
02:43:03.510 --> 02:43:04.680
but you can have a guide.

6687
02:43:04.680 --> 02:43:07.500
Like perfect example is um,

6688
02:43:07.950 --> 02:43:09.120
Toni Bradlee,

6689
02:43:09.180 --> 02:43:10.013
Timothy Bradley.

6690
02:43:10.220 --> 02:43:11.790
Bill like a fucking brick shit house.

6691
02:43:11.920 --> 02:43:13.060
Harley knocks anybody out.

6692
02:43:13.100 --> 02:43:13.560
Yup.

6693
02:43:13.560 --> 02:43:14.111
You know,

6694
02:43:14.111 --> 02:43:14.560
he's,

6695
02:43:14.560 --> 02:43:16.180
he swings hard too,

6696
02:43:16.300 --> 02:43:17.770
but just guys don't go.

6697
02:43:17.890 --> 02:43:18.610
It's weird.

6698
02:43:18.610 --> 02:43:21.760
Like some guys just have that crazy can casa.

6699
02:43:21.970 --> 02:43:24.760
I also think it's Keith Thurman has crazy,

6700
02:43:24.820 --> 02:43:25.930
Ooh,

6701
02:43:26.050 --> 02:43:26.320
yeah.

6702
02:43:26.320 --> 02:43:27.690
He doesn't look like he has any problem.

6703
02:43:27.700 --> 02:43:28.120
No.

6704
02:43:28.120 --> 02:43:29.260
He's a perfect example.

6705
02:43:29.290 --> 02:43:31.000
He looks like he's going to be all ready for the world.

6706
02:43:31.980 --> 02:43:32.811
All his hair.

6707
02:43:32.811 --> 02:43:34.330
He's wearing braids and shit,

6708
02:43:34.600 --> 02:43:34.901
but he,

6709
02:43:34.901 --> 02:43:35.740
he knocks out.

6710
02:43:35.741 --> 02:43:39.010
Dude's dead Knox and Deborah in his last fight where you went the distance.

6711
02:43:39.190 --> 02:43:40.450
How about a Donna Stevenson?

6712
02:43:40.810 --> 02:43:42.340
That motherfucker can punch.

6713
02:43:42.370 --> 02:43:44.140
So cause you just say yes,

6714
02:43:44.141 --> 02:43:44.974
he can.

6715
02:43:45.100 --> 02:43:45.281
Yeah,

6716
02:43:45.281 --> 02:43:45.791
he's an engineer.

6717
02:43:45.791 --> 02:43:48.570
He's undefeated American 32 and 32 knockouts,

6718
02:43:48.580 --> 02:43:50.200
but they're not moving them towards Klitschko.

6719
02:43:50.201 --> 02:43:50.950
What's that about?

6720
02:43:50.950 --> 02:43:51.341
<v 4>No,</v>

6721
02:43:51.341 --> 02:43:52.001
they don't need to.

6722
02:43:52.001 --> 02:43:52.510
They're going to,

6723
02:43:52.510 --> 02:43:54.100
he's fighting stover and for a title,

6724
02:43:54.101 --> 02:43:54.671
why would you fight?

6725
02:43:54.671 --> 02:43:55.391
Klitschko yeah,

6726
02:43:55.391 --> 02:43:55.901
but why not?

6727
02:43:55.901 --> 02:43:56.734
Why would you fight the guy?

6728
02:43:56.800 --> 02:44:00.310
You might as well get the title from Vern and then make a big money about

6729
02:44:00.311 --> 02:44:02.980
against Klitschko to bring the titles back to America and Blah,

6730
02:44:02.981 --> 02:44:03.161
blah,

6731
02:44:03.161 --> 02:44:03.371
blah.

6732
02:44:03.371 --> 02:44:04.810
And then you're gonna get knocked out by Klitschko.

6733
02:44:04.840 --> 02:44:05.590
Do you think so?

6734
02:44:05.590 --> 02:44:05.951
Yeah.

6735
02:44:05.951 --> 02:44:07.650
Chris has got way too much experience and,

6736
02:44:07.790 --> 02:44:09.580
and clutch goes,

6737
02:44:09.581 --> 02:44:09.970
uh,

6738
02:44:09.970 --> 02:44:11.440
a boxer fighter.

6739
02:44:11.441 --> 02:44:11.621
Like,

6740
02:44:11.621 --> 02:44:11.810
Hey,

6741
02:44:11.810 --> 02:44:12.643
it's what he did.

6742
02:44:12.940 --> 02:44:15.520
And then s and wilder is a guy who was like,

6743
02:44:15.521 --> 02:44:15.641
hey,

6744
02:44:15.641 --> 02:44:16.301
you're really strong.

6745
02:44:16.301 --> 02:44:17.134
You want to box.

6746
02:44:17.950 --> 02:44:18.760
You think so?

6747
02:44:18.760 --> 02:44:19.061
Yeah.

6748
02:44:19.061 --> 02:44:21.100
He's kind of fabricated almost to a certain degree,

6749
02:44:21.390 --> 02:44:26.190
but zoom like 32 and he is 3,232 knockouts and he's gotten a fabricator.

6750
02:44:26.330 --> 02:44:26.740
That sounds,

6751
02:44:26.740 --> 02:44:27.100
I mean,

6752
02:44:27.100 --> 02:44:27.821
look at his records.

6753
02:44:27.821 --> 02:44:28.061
I mean,

6754
02:44:28.061 --> 02:44:28.541
look at the guys.

6755
02:44:28.541 --> 02:44:28.931
He's fine.

6756
02:44:28.931 --> 02:44:29.740
It's not like he's fine.

6757
02:44:29.740 --> 02:44:31.660
You know why that was a hard guy to fight,

6758
02:44:31.661 --> 02:44:32.110
you know?

6759
02:44:32.110 --> 02:44:32.261
Well,

6760
02:44:32.261 --> 02:44:34.630
he's got power and he's a big guy.

6761
02:44:35.230 --> 02:44:36.070
He's a big dude.

6762
02:44:36.160 --> 02:44:37.840
Isn't any light at least like six,

6763
02:44:37.841 --> 02:44:38.630
six or 600.

6764
02:44:38.630 --> 02:44:39.040
Right.

6765
02:44:39.040 --> 02:44:39.350
What does,

6766
02:44:39.350 --> 02:44:39.560
okay,

6767
02:44:39.560 --> 02:44:40.080
let's listen.

6768
02:44:40.080 --> 02:44:40.511
I've met him.

6769
02:44:40.511 --> 02:44:41.770
He's a big fucking guy.

6770
02:44:42.180 --> 02:44:42.730
Um,

6771
02:44:42.730 --> 02:44:43.600
what do you think he weighs?

6772
02:44:44.050 --> 02:44:48.460
Probably run to 22 to 25 maybe he's six foot seven.

6773
02:44:48.490 --> 02:44:48.891
Six.

6774
02:44:48.891 --> 02:44:50.710
Jesus Christ the way to 30.

6775
02:44:50.770 --> 02:44:51.820
That's a big fella.

6776
02:44:51.910 --> 02:44:52.810
Um,

6777
02:44:55.990 --> 02:44:57.990
so doesn't have it in his Wikipedia.

6778
02:44:58.630 --> 02:44:59.101
Doesn't that was,

6779
02:44:59.101 --> 02:44:59.934
wait,

6780
02:45:00.560 --> 02:45:01.393
let's ask Siri.

6781
02:45:01.740 --> 02:45:02.573
Yeah.

6782
02:45:04.300 --> 02:45:06.790
What is the weight of Deontay wilder

6783
02:45:10.260 --> 02:45:11.093
<v 5>checking on that.</v>

6784
02:45:12.120 --> 02:45:14.450
Here's what I found on the web for what is the way to dying?

6785
02:45:14.490 --> 02:45:15.230
Wilder.

6786
02:45:15.230 --> 02:45:15.500
<v 4>Hmm.</v>

6787
02:45:15.500 --> 02:45:16.333
Diane?

6788
02:45:17.160 --> 02:45:17.993
Uh,

6789
02:45:18.080 --> 02:45:18.670
no.

6790
02:45:18.670 --> 02:45:20.440
His middle name is lashawn.

6791
02:45:20.800 --> 02:45:23.890
How dairy pro debut and uh,

6792
02:45:24.260 --> 02:45:25.630
they want an Olympic bronze medal.

6793
02:45:25.631 --> 02:45:25.871
Okay.

6794
02:45:25.871 --> 02:45:27.580
So he has a little bit of an amateur record.

6795
02:45:27.610 --> 02:45:27.731
Yeah.

6796
02:45:27.731 --> 02:45:28.564
How dare you?

6797
02:45:28.600 --> 02:45:29.490
My Dad taught me bed,

6798
02:45:29.560 --> 02:45:30.393
my bed.

6799
02:45:31.190 --> 02:45:31.630
Wait,

6800
02:45:31.630 --> 02:45:32.530
I'll admit when I'm wrong.

6801
02:45:32.710 --> 02:45:33.543
Let's see.

6802
02:45:34.700 --> 02:45:35.750
<v 2>215 pounds.</v>

6803
02:45:35.751 --> 02:45:35.871
Yeah,

6804
02:45:35.871 --> 02:45:36.330
it was right.

6805
02:45:36.330 --> 02:45:37.610
He's to 15.

6806
02:45:37.640 --> 02:45:38.120
Yup.

6807
02:45:38.120 --> 02:45:38.241
Oh,

6808
02:45:38.241 --> 02:45:40.510
that'd be six foot seven 250.

6809
02:45:40.511 --> 02:45:42.230
He's very tall and lean.

6810
02:45:42.710 --> 02:45:42.891
Yeah.

6811
02:45:42.891 --> 02:45:43.670
That's crazy.

6812
02:45:43.670 --> 02:45:44.450
Yeah.

6813
02:45:44.450 --> 02:45:46.700
That's not a good way to fight Klitschko at well,

6814
02:45:46.701 --> 02:45:48.380
it's a good height to fight Klitschko App.

6815
02:45:48.490 --> 02:45:48.731
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

6816
02:45:48.731 --> 02:45:49.271
But then you know,

6817
02:45:49.271 --> 02:45:50.230
you don't if you don't have the,

6818
02:45:50.231 --> 02:45:51.064
uh,

6819
02:45:51.350 --> 02:45:51.850
<v 5>okay.</v>

6820
02:45:51.850 --> 02:45:52.121
<v 4>I mean,</v>

6821
02:45:52.121 --> 02:45:53.800
I mean weight's not everything,

6822
02:45:53.801 --> 02:45:54.281
but I mean,

6823
02:45:54.281 --> 02:45:55.114
you know,

6824
02:45:55.300 --> 02:45:57.340
if you're getting hit by a guy the same size as you,

6825
02:45:57.670 --> 02:45:59.800
a good big man will always beat a good little man.

6826
02:46:00.280 --> 02:46:00.970
Yeah.

6827
02:46:00.970 --> 02:46:04.270
And A and Klitschko it would theoretically be the bigger man cause he's at

6828
02:46:04.271 --> 02:46:05.530
around two 40 to 50.

6829
02:46:05.630 --> 02:46:05.890
Okay.

6830
02:46:05.890 --> 02:46:06.071
Yeah,

6831
02:46:06.071 --> 02:46:06.970
he's definitely bigger.

6832
02:46:07.120 --> 02:46:08.620
He's also just so smart.

6833
02:46:08.920 --> 02:46:10.160
The thing about clicks goes built.

6834
02:46:10.190 --> 02:46:10.701
<v 2>He's not like,</v>

6835
02:46:10.701 --> 02:46:11.020
you know,

6836
02:46:11.020 --> 02:46:11.350
uh,

6837
02:46:11.350 --> 02:46:12.890
a fabricated size man.

6838
02:46:12.891 --> 02:46:14.390
That's just the fucking way he is.

6839
02:46:14.420 --> 02:46:14.720
Yeah.

6840
02:46:14.720 --> 02:46:15.140
He's,

6841
02:46:15.140 --> 02:46:16.700
he's got stuck genetics.

6842
02:46:16.880 --> 02:46:18.620
You ever see that video where Deontay wilder,

6843
02:46:18.621 --> 02:46:20.030
he fought an Internet troll.

6844
02:46:20.060 --> 02:46:20.241
Yeah.

6845
02:46:20.241 --> 02:46:21.410
He wouldn't beat the shit.

6846
02:46:21.820 --> 02:46:23.480
It's so crazy that the guy showed up.

6847
02:46:23.660 --> 02:46:25.700
The Guy who went to the gym with him,

6848
02:46:25.730 --> 02:46:27.980
I think the guy thought it wasn't going to happen like that.

6849
02:46:28.490 --> 02:46:29.270
Really.

6850
02:46:29.270 --> 02:46:29.931
I think the guy was like,

6851
02:46:29.931 --> 02:46:30.531
what are you going to do?

6852
02:46:30.531 --> 02:46:34.580
Beat me up while the guy was talking all kinds of crazy shit and then agreed to

6853
02:46:34.581 --> 02:46:36.650
meet him and I think it was at the Hollywood gym,

6854
02:46:36.890 --> 02:46:39.180
that gym on mentoring mad as fuck.

6855
02:46:39.350 --> 02:46:41.780
He beat the shit out of that dude was so late and he was down.

6856
02:46:41.781 --> 02:46:42.610
He was punching him.

6857
02:46:42.610 --> 02:46:43.030
Yup.

6858
02:46:43.030 --> 02:46:43.281
Yeah,

6859
02:46:43.281 --> 02:46:43.491
that was,

6860
02:46:43.491 --> 02:46:44.210
I needed it.

6861
02:46:44.210 --> 02:46:44.691
Fuck yeah,

6862
02:46:44.691 --> 02:46:45.201
you did.

6863
02:46:45.201 --> 02:46:45.950
Yeah.

6864
02:46:45.950 --> 02:46:46.940
It's just weird that they,

6865
02:46:46.941 --> 02:46:47.774
uh,

6866
02:46:47.960 --> 02:46:50.180
that the guy actually put the gloves on,

6867
02:46:50.360 --> 02:46:51.110
you know,

6868
02:46:51.110 --> 02:46:53.210
I think he just thought as he's going to toy with me,

6869
02:46:53.370 --> 02:46:53.601
we didn't,

6870
02:46:53.601 --> 02:46:54.980
I mean he would make me make,

6871
02:46:54.981 --> 02:46:55.251
maybe,

6872
02:46:55.251 --> 02:46:57.320
maybe hurt me a little bit so he can teach me a lesson.

6873
02:46:57.630 --> 02:46:59.540
Here's an article on ESPN boxing.

6874
02:46:59.541 --> 02:47:00.374
How rude is this?

6875
02:47:00.530 --> 02:47:05.530
Is Deontay wilder another heavyweight hoax like Gerry Cooney before him knockout

6876
02:47:06.261 --> 02:47:08.750
artists could crumble if not truly tested.

6877
02:47:09.380 --> 02:47:10.190
Huh?

6878
02:47:10.190 --> 02:47:12.920
Deon taze got holes in his defense is what the problem is.

6879
02:47:12.950 --> 02:47:13.783
Does he?

6880
02:47:13.890 --> 02:47:14.110
Yeah.

6881
02:47:14.110 --> 02:47:14.990
They're trying to tighten that up.

6882
02:47:14.991 --> 02:47:15.824
Who does he train with?

6883
02:47:16.190 --> 02:47:16.461
A,

6884
02:47:16.461 --> 02:47:17.360
I know my boy Russ.

6885
02:47:17.361 --> 02:47:18.950
Amber was training with them for a little bit.

6886
02:47:18.951 --> 02:47:20.060
I don't know if he's still with rust,

6887
02:47:20.061 --> 02:47:20.241
you know,

6888
02:47:20.241 --> 02:47:20.481
rust.

6889
02:47:20.481 --> 02:47:21.440
He owns rival gear?

6890
02:47:21.620 --> 02:47:22.453
No,

6891
02:47:22.850 --> 02:47:23.031
no.

6892
02:47:23.031 --> 02:47:24.200
I've heard of rival gear though.

6893
02:47:24.510 --> 02:47:29.510
I think that's like a really significant part of a fighter's career is who's

6894
02:47:30.231 --> 02:47:30.800
teaching them.

6895
02:47:30.800 --> 02:47:31.940
It's so significant,

6896
02:47:32.330 --> 02:47:33.260
so gigantic.

6897
02:47:33.261 --> 02:47:33.411
I mean,

6898
02:47:33.411 --> 02:47:34.640
you can have all the athletic talent,

6899
02:47:34.641 --> 02:47:34.941
oral,

6900
02:47:34.941 --> 02:47:35.751
all the desire,

6901
02:47:35.751 --> 02:47:37.790
all the historical knowledge of boxing.

6902
02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:39.080
But if you're not have a god,

6903
02:47:39.081 --> 02:47:40.070
it's right in front of you.

6904
02:47:40.071 --> 02:47:41.660
That's catching little habits.

6905
02:47:41.661 --> 02:47:42.261
You see a,

6906
02:47:42.261 --> 02:47:43.250
you see it with Mike,

6907
02:47:43.251 --> 02:47:45.710
you know Mike Tyson when he changed from,

6908
02:47:45.800 --> 02:47:46.070
you know,

6909
02:47:46.070 --> 02:47:49.840
from Kevin Rooney to a Richard Gere Ketty and you know,

6910
02:47:49.910 --> 02:47:51.770
I'm fucking errands snowfall and shit.

6911
02:47:51.790 --> 02:47:53.750
Like it's all going downhill from here.

6912
02:47:53.840 --> 02:47:53.961
Well,

6913
02:47:53.961 --> 02:47:55.780
he was already just on a spiral by then.

6914
02:47:56.390 --> 02:47:57.770
Once custom motto died,

6915
02:47:57.771 --> 02:47:59.140
it was probably very difficult.

6916
02:47:59.150 --> 02:48:00.260
You should have just kept Kevin,

6917
02:48:00.261 --> 02:48:01.094
you know,

6918
02:48:01.490 --> 02:48:04.240
Kevin had cussed style down to a tee and Yup.

6919
02:48:04.750 --> 02:48:06.140
And Kevin pro boxer himself.

6920
02:48:06.141 --> 02:48:07.640
But then there was a lot of issues there.

6921
02:48:07.720 --> 02:48:08.420
You know,

6922
02:48:08.420 --> 02:48:11.900
I don't think anybody could live like Mike Tyson lived and make,

6923
02:48:11.990 --> 02:48:15.530
get it through unscathed and figure it out every step of the was no way.

6924
02:48:15.920 --> 02:48:17.210
He just going to get too crazy.

6925
02:48:17.550 --> 02:48:17.760
Yeah.

6926
02:48:17.760 --> 02:48:18.060
You can,

6927
02:48:18.060 --> 02:48:18.410
there's no,

6928
02:48:18.410 --> 02:48:19.340
no matter who you are.

6929
02:48:19.370 --> 02:48:21.980
I mean it's just the excess is so much.

6930
02:48:22.010 --> 02:48:22.670
Yeah,

6931
02:48:22.670 --> 02:48:23.421
well it's like you see,

6932
02:48:23.421 --> 02:48:24.080
I mean,

6933
02:48:24.080 --> 02:48:25.550
I've said that about Justin Bieber,

6934
02:48:25.760 --> 02:48:27.640
like people like just to be researching asshole,

6935
02:48:27.710 --> 02:48:32.420
like you don't think you would be if you in 19 $19 million in the bank and

6936
02:48:32.421 --> 02:48:33.830
nobody's telling you know,

6937
02:48:33.890 --> 02:48:34.670
nobody.

6938
02:48:34.670 --> 02:48:37.430
How could they even his dad's part of the entourage.

6939
02:48:37.431 --> 02:48:39.200
Shanice Dad's happy to be there.

6940
02:48:39.470 --> 02:48:40.430
Super happy.

6941
02:48:40.490 --> 02:48:40.690
Yeah.

6942
02:48:40.690 --> 02:48:42.470
And he's 19 at the end of the day,

6943
02:48:42.471 --> 02:48:43.700
he's fucking 19 year old boy.

6944
02:48:43.701 --> 02:48:45.170
What would you do at 19 you were,

6945
02:48:45.290 --> 02:48:46.700
I was an asshole with no money.

6946
02:48:46.730 --> 02:48:47.450
Exactly.

6947
02:48:47.450 --> 02:48:48.081
You know what I mean?

6948
02:48:48.081 --> 02:48:49.160
So it was a little boy.

6949
02:48:49.190 --> 02:48:51.830
He's a boy doing things that a boy would fucking be doing.

6950
02:48:51.860 --> 02:48:53.870
I was an idiot when I was 29 yeah.

6951
02:48:54.140 --> 02:48:55.550
10 years later I was retarded.

6952
02:48:56.240 --> 02:48:58.190
This fucking kids out there with $1 billion.

6953
02:48:58.480 --> 02:48:59.810
Got It plain for Christmas.

6954
02:48:59.900 --> 02:49:01.040
He got a plane for Christmas.

6955
02:49:02.030 --> 02:49:03.140
That was a lie.

6956
02:49:03.470 --> 02:49:04.040
That was a lie.

6957
02:49:04.040 --> 02:49:04.221
Yeah.

6958
02:49:04.221 --> 02:49:05.054
He's just,

6959
02:49:05.120 --> 02:49:07.530
he just took a plane at that planes for sale though.

6960
02:49:07.560 --> 02:49:09.950
But he just took it and took photos and I said,

6961
02:49:09.960 --> 02:49:10.170
hey,

6962
02:49:10.170 --> 02:49:11.160
look what I got for Christmas.

6963
02:49:11.190 --> 02:49:12.570
How do you know it was on Tmz?

6964
02:49:13.050 --> 02:49:14.160
I would say that TMZ,

6965
02:49:14.161 --> 02:49:15.930
if I've encountered a bunch of hate and be like,

6966
02:49:15.950 --> 02:49:18.970
don't tell these people that I probably got high too is kind of freaking me out

6967
02:49:18.971 --> 02:49:21.060
that I told everybody we got to play in the solemn line.

6968
02:49:21.150 --> 02:49:21.930
Yeah.

6969
02:49:21.930 --> 02:49:23.070
And then Mayweather was like,

6970
02:49:23.071 --> 02:49:23.341
yeah,

6971
02:49:23.341 --> 02:49:23.611
look,

6972
02:49:23.611 --> 02:49:26.520
congrats Joe to joining the jet club or whatever.

6973
02:49:26.521 --> 02:49:27.354
You know,

6974
02:49:27.810 --> 02:49:28.760
how long before May,

6975
02:49:28.761 --> 02:49:32.100
whether after he retires becomes broke the way he does things.

6976
02:49:32.101 --> 02:49:34.630
That it could be sooner than you think or not.

6977
02:49:34.730 --> 02:49:39.620
Wasn't he like he was a situation before he signed with golden boy where it

6978
02:49:39.660 --> 02:49:40.381
didn't he oh,

6979
02:49:40.381 --> 02:49:41.520
a shit load of money.

6980
02:49:41.910 --> 02:49:43.420
Like he needs to pay,

6981
02:49:43.500 --> 02:49:43.780
you know,

6982
02:49:43.780 --> 02:49:45.510
a lot of these guys don't pay their taxes and then,

6983
02:49:47.370 --> 02:49:47.551
yeah.

6984
02:49:47.551 --> 02:49:51.740
But I mean he started making a lavish habits that cannot be maintained,

6985
02:49:52.490 --> 02:49:54.450
have any gamble gambles.

6986
02:49:54.451 --> 02:49:55.710
That's going to be a downfall.

6987
02:49:56.280 --> 02:49:57.690
Gambling can be her downfall,

6988
02:49:57.750 --> 02:49:58.110
uh,

6989
02:49:58.110 --> 02:50:01.920
going to strip clubs and dropping $1 million in there.

6990
02:50:01.921 --> 02:50:02.820
He does that well,

6991
02:50:02.850 --> 02:50:04.200
100,000 sometimes.

6992
02:50:04.201 --> 02:50:04.351
You know,

6993
02:50:04.351 --> 02:50:05.150
just fucking,

6994
02:50:05.150 --> 02:50:06.450
it's just good kid.

6995
02:50:07.200 --> 02:50:08.430
I'll just have fun,

6996
02:50:08.820 --> 02:50:09.780
but isn't that way you're supposed to,

6997
02:50:09.781 --> 02:50:11.040
you should do it once in a while,

6998
02:50:11.041 --> 02:50:11.401
but it's,

6999
02:50:11.401 --> 02:50:11.701
you know,

7000
02:50:11.701 --> 02:50:13.170
it seems like he does it all the time.

7001
02:50:13.340 --> 02:50:16.210
It doesn't even make like $100 million a fight or something crazy like he does

7002
02:50:16.211 --> 02:50:17.490
make a shit ton of money.

7003
02:50:17.510 --> 02:50:19.500
So if you made 100 bucks at a Gig,

7004
02:50:19.530 --> 02:50:21.030
go to strip clubs to drop one,

7005
02:50:21.750 --> 02:50:22.583
drop a dollar.

7006
02:50:22.670 --> 02:50:23.640
Oh,

7007
02:50:23.790 --> 02:50:24.481
you're like fuck it.

7008
02:50:24.481 --> 02:50:25.440
Throw it on that table.

7009
02:50:25.441 --> 02:50:25.701
I was going,

7010
02:50:25.701 --> 02:50:25.831
well,

7011
02:50:25.831 --> 02:50:26.461
fuck yeah.

7012
02:50:26.461 --> 02:50:28.000
Run around the room and then slam it.

7013
02:50:28.590 --> 02:50:29.640
Put that dollar down.

7014
02:50:29.641 --> 02:50:30.910
I made $100 to date.

7015
02:50:31.800 --> 02:50:32.633
Crumple it up.

7016
02:50:33.000 --> 02:50:34.310
Throw it here,

7017
02:50:34.330 --> 02:50:35.163
bitch.

7018
02:50:35.640 --> 02:50:36.473
That's what he's doing.

7019
02:50:36.480 --> 02:50:36.751
I mean,

7020
02:50:36.751 --> 02:50:37.584
isn't that crazy?

7021
02:50:37.650 --> 02:50:39.060
It makes $100 million,

7022
02:50:39.240 --> 02:50:39.731
I guess.

7023
02:50:39.731 --> 02:50:40.230
You know,

7024
02:50:40.230 --> 02:50:41.010
that's $1 million,

7025
02:50:41.010 --> 02:50:41.411
but you got to,

7026
02:50:41.411 --> 02:50:43.260
he's got a huge team around him.

7027
02:50:43.290 --> 02:50:43.770
Giant.

7028
02:50:43.770 --> 02:50:45.120
Everybody's got to get paid.

7029
02:50:45.840 --> 02:50:50.060
It's going to be interesting to watch how that plays out because he's 36 or 37

7030
02:50:50.090 --> 02:50:53.790
seven starting to slowly but surely reached that age where you're like,

7031
02:50:53.791 --> 02:50:54.091
okay,

7032
02:50:54.091 --> 02:50:57.300
how much longer can he's got to start weaning people off the teat?

7033
02:50:57.420 --> 02:50:58.230
Yeah.

7034
02:50:58.230 --> 02:51:03.230
I mean how many guys can do with Bernard Hopkins has done maybe only Bernard

7035
02:51:03.570 --> 02:51:05.130
Hopkins 49 years old,

7036
02:51:05.340 --> 02:51:07.110
but Bernardo never got the money that may,

7037
02:51:07.120 --> 02:51:08.430
whether it's true,

7038
02:51:08.670 --> 02:51:09.600
so still hasn't.

7039
02:51:09.780 --> 02:51:10.260
Right,

7040
02:51:10.260 --> 02:51:11.670
but he's still made millions.

7041
02:51:11.940 --> 02:51:14.160
I mean don't cry for Bernard Hopkins,

7042
02:51:14.340 --> 02:51:17.250
but he's 49 years old and he's still fighting guys like Cobra Love,

7043
02:51:17.550 --> 02:51:18.660
which is just incredible.

7044
02:51:18.690 --> 02:51:19.830
I hope he's retired by now,

7045
02:51:19.831 --> 02:51:20.640
right after that.

7046
02:51:20.640 --> 02:51:20.860
Like,

7047
02:51:20.860 --> 02:51:21.270
oh,

7048
02:51:21.270 --> 02:51:22.350
I don't think he's going to,

7049
02:51:22.740 --> 02:51:23.760
I think he's going to keep going.

7050
02:51:23.820 --> 02:51:24.630
I don't think that's,

7051
02:51:24.630 --> 02:51:25.920
I think the mistake he's going to make.

7052
02:51:25.980 --> 02:51:27.270
I don't know about that man.

7053
02:51:27.450 --> 02:51:30.660
I watched the Donna Stevens fight and the Donna Stevens knocked out that Russian

7054
02:51:30.661 --> 02:51:30.961
camp,

7055
02:51:30.961 --> 02:51:31.410
but I was like,

7056
02:51:31.410 --> 02:51:32.071
you know what man?

7057
02:51:32.071 --> 02:51:33.590
That guy kind of stood right in front of them.

7058
02:51:34.020 --> 02:51:34.321
You know,

7059
02:51:34.321 --> 02:51:34.381
he,

7060
02:51:34.381 --> 02:51:38.730
he probed him for a while with like the low jab and moving back and forth,

7061
02:51:38.731 --> 02:51:40.440
but at Donna's hits so goddamn hard.

7062
02:51:40.441 --> 02:51:42.030
If you've got any holes in your game,

7063
02:51:42.450 --> 02:51:43.560
Adonis is going to find him.

7064
02:51:43.561 --> 02:51:44.580
He's going to plug them up.

7065
02:51:44.610 --> 02:51:44.820
Yeah.

7066
02:51:44.820 --> 02:51:45.361
I think he could.

7067
02:51:45.361 --> 02:51:47.390
Outbox a Donna's take a time and then retiring.

7068
02:51:47.410 --> 02:51:47.821
I could see it.

7069
02:51:47.821 --> 02:51:49.380
I think he could be at a Donna Stephens,

7070
02:51:49.470 --> 02:51:49.890
I think,

7071
02:51:49.890 --> 02:51:51.060
isn't Sean Pascal fighting?

7072
02:51:51.061 --> 02:51:52.490
Somebody isn't,

7073
02:51:52.800 --> 02:51:53.760
I think he wants to fight it.

7074
02:51:53.761 --> 02:51:54.594
Donna Stevenson.

7075
02:51:54.900 --> 02:51:57.180
Well didn't because they're both much real him.

7076
02:51:57.210 --> 02:51:58.043
Haitian guys.

7077
02:51:58.290 --> 02:51:59.101
Hopkins beat him,

7078
02:51:59.101 --> 02:51:59.490
right?

7079
02:51:59.490 --> 02:52:00.323
Yeah.

7080
02:52:00.450 --> 02:52:01.261
We beat Hopkins.

7081
02:52:01.261 --> 02:52:02.100
Hopkins beat him.

7082
02:52:02.160 --> 02:52:03.030
He beat Hopkins.

7083
02:52:03.210 --> 02:52:03.661
John Pass.

7084
02:52:03.661 --> 02:52:04.830
He beat him in one fight.

7085
02:52:05.140 --> 02:52:05.560
I Dunno.

7086
02:52:05.560 --> 02:52:06.660
And then they had a rematch.

7087
02:52:06.970 --> 02:52:07.690
Let's find out.

7088
02:52:07.690 --> 02:52:08.760
Let's do Bernard Hopkins.

7089
02:52:08.770 --> 02:52:09.610
So they fought twice,

7090
02:52:09.611 --> 02:52:10.444
right?

7091
02:52:11.470 --> 02:52:12.303
<v 11>Uh,</v>

7092
02:52:12.310 --> 02:52:14.470
maybe Bernard.

7093
02:52:15.910 --> 02:52:16.930
<v 2>I could text John Pascoe.</v>

7094
02:52:17.100 --> 02:52:17.471
Can you,

7095
02:52:17.471 --> 02:52:17.950
you know,

7096
02:52:17.950 --> 02:52:18.850
I do Canadians,

7097
02:52:18.851 --> 02:52:19.684
we all know each other.

7098
02:52:19.750 --> 02:52:20.030
The,

7099
02:52:20.030 --> 02:52:20.351
you know,

7100
02:52:20.351 --> 02:52:21.070
GSP.

7101
02:52:21.070 --> 02:52:21.700
I do.

7102
02:52:21.700 --> 02:52:22.690
You do know you know him well.

7103
02:52:23.140 --> 02:52:23.411
No,

7104
02:52:23.411 --> 02:52:26.470
I know for Ra's better for us as a fucking great guy.

7105
02:52:26.530 --> 02:52:27.363
I love that dude.

7106
02:52:27.760 --> 02:52:29.080
Do you think that George is going to come back?

7107
02:52:30.160 --> 02:52:30.993
Um,

7108
02:52:31.610 --> 02:52:32.060
uh,

7109
02:52:32.060 --> 02:52:33.970
he needs to desire to come back.

7110
02:52:34.780 --> 02:52:38.320
He looked like he had lacked any kind of enthusiasm to be there anymore.

7111
02:52:38.980 --> 02:52:39.800
You're right.

7112
02:52:39.800 --> 02:52:43.000
Almost he beat John Pascale and how to draw was John.

7113
02:52:43.160 --> 02:52:45.910
So that was four years ago and the incredible,

7114
02:52:46.000 --> 02:52:48.610
he was fucking 45 back then.

7115
02:52:48.660 --> 02:52:49.240
Yeah.

7116
02:52:49.240 --> 02:52:50.560
And he's still swinging and does that,

7117
02:52:50.561 --> 02:52:50.710
that's,

7118
02:52:50.710 --> 02:52:50.861
you know,

7119
02:52:50.861 --> 02:52:53.950
that they say that he's probably older than he says he is too.

7120
02:52:53.951 --> 02:52:55.210
Because when he was in jail,

7121
02:52:56.560 --> 02:52:57.070
really?

7122
02:52:57.070 --> 02:52:57.281
Yeah.

7123
02:52:57.281 --> 02:53:00.850
They say he might be like in his fifties but that's crazy.

7124
02:53:01.510 --> 02:53:02.920
How does a guy like that and maintain?

7125
02:53:03.970 --> 02:53:05.260
He's never been in wars.

7126
02:53:05.261 --> 02:53:06.100
He never got beat up.

7127
02:53:06.101 --> 02:53:06.790
You know what I mean?

7128
02:53:06.790 --> 02:53:07.720
I understand that.

7129
02:53:07.721 --> 02:53:08.380
But I mean,

7130
02:53:08.380 --> 02:53:12.670
the physical reflex is involved in professional boxing are so,

7131
02:53:13.120 --> 02:53:14.470
it's so significant.

7132
02:53:14.471 --> 02:53:16.600
I think it's one of those things where he stays training.

7133
02:53:16.601 --> 02:53:17.434
He doesn't,

7134
02:53:17.920 --> 02:53:18.520
there's no,

7135
02:53:18.520 --> 02:53:21.340
there's no time where he has to get back in the gym,

7136
02:53:21.341 --> 02:53:21.620
you know?

7137
02:53:21.620 --> 02:53:22.300
Yeah.

7138
02:53:22.300 --> 02:53:24.340
I think if you continuously stay in the gym,

7139
02:53:24.341 --> 02:53:25.210
you'll be okay.

7140
02:53:25.860 --> 02:53:26.561
Like Mayweather.

7141
02:53:26.561 --> 02:53:28.030
Mayweather is never out of shape.

7142
02:53:28.040 --> 02:53:28.873
Mayweather.

7143
02:53:28.900 --> 02:53:31.330
Literally has to gain a couple of pounds to make weight.

7144
02:53:31.540 --> 02:53:31.781
Yeah,

7145
02:53:31.781 --> 02:53:32.531
I guess that's it,

7146
02:53:32.531 --> 02:53:32.860
man.

7147
02:53:32.860 --> 02:53:33.693
I mean it's the only thing,

7148
02:53:33.780 --> 02:53:36.700
it's the only thing that makes you walk around at wait all times.

7149
02:53:36.810 --> 02:53:37.181
I mean,

7150
02:53:37.181 --> 02:53:38.014
how hard is it to,

7151
02:53:38.750 --> 02:53:39.610
to maintain that,

7152
02:53:39.760 --> 02:53:41.470
but it's also lets your lifestyle,

7153
02:53:41.610 --> 02:53:43.960
you just abuse like your knuckles,

7154
02:53:43.961 --> 02:53:44.950
your joints,

7155
02:53:44.951 --> 02:53:45.400
you know,

7156
02:53:45.400 --> 02:53:47.560
everything just going to slowly but surely,

7157
02:53:48.310 --> 02:53:49.143
I guess.

7158
02:53:49.270 --> 02:53:49.850
But it's,

7159
02:53:49.850 --> 02:53:51.610
you're going to have to go that hard all the time.

7160
02:53:52.270 --> 02:53:52.601
Yeah.

7161
02:53:52.601 --> 02:53:53.434
I mean,

7162
02:53:53.590 --> 02:53:55.060
but when you fight a guy like Coldwell lab,

7163
02:53:55.061 --> 02:53:55.780
you have to,

7164
02:53:55.780 --> 02:53:56.111
I mean you're,

7165
02:53:56.111 --> 02:53:58.560
you're fighting 12 he also underestimated Kovalev.

7166
02:53:58.720 --> 02:53:59.350
Do you think so?

7167
02:53:59.350 --> 02:54:00.183
I think so.

7168
02:54:00.490 --> 02:54:01.810
I think he knew Koval I've had power,

7169
02:54:01.811 --> 02:54:03.280
but I think he thought he'd get out slick him.

7170
02:54:03.850 --> 02:54:04.151
Yeah.

7171
02:54:04.151 --> 02:54:05.110
Well that was what he was saying,

7172
02:54:05.111 --> 02:54:08.070
that it was going to be Kelly Pavlik too.

7173
02:54:08.350 --> 02:54:08.710
You know,

7174
02:54:08.710 --> 02:54:11.500
Kelly Pavlock was that really put them on the map again,

7175
02:54:11.880 --> 02:54:12.221
you know,

7176
02:54:12.221 --> 02:54:13.270
after the Jermaine Taylor,

7177
02:54:13.271 --> 02:54:16.480
that was a big venture and the public just fucking took a shit.

7178
02:54:16.481 --> 02:54:17.740
His career took a shit after that.

7179
02:54:18.130 --> 02:54:18.281
Well,

7180
02:54:18.281 --> 02:54:18.510
yeah.

7181
02:54:18.510 --> 02:54:20.620
The problem with the booze man.

7182
02:54:20.860 --> 02:54:21.690
Pavlock yeah.

7183
02:54:21.690 --> 02:54:24.010
Pavlik he had a sad case.

7184
02:54:24.550 --> 02:54:25.031
Youngstown,

7185
02:54:25.031 --> 02:54:25.451
Ohio.

7186
02:54:25.451 --> 02:54:25.990
How was that?

7187
02:54:25.990 --> 02:54:26.823
How far is that from me?

7188
02:54:27.070 --> 02:54:29.890
That's Tony Hinchcliffe his hometown to two hours.

7189
02:54:30.910 --> 02:54:31.090
Yeah.

7190
02:54:31.090 --> 02:54:33.340
Kelly Pavlik that was way back in 2008.

7191
02:54:33.341 --> 02:54:34.091
Isn't that crazy?

7192
02:54:34.091 --> 02:54:35.650
That was six fucking years ago.

7193
02:54:35.740 --> 02:54:37.030
There was a huge upset,

7194
02:54:37.780 --> 02:54:38.800
unanimous decision.

7195
02:54:38.830 --> 02:54:39.700
12 rounds.

7196
02:54:39.740 --> 02:54:40.840
I shouldn't say huge upset,

7197
02:54:40.841 --> 02:54:41.770
but it was a pretty big,

7198
02:54:41.771 --> 02:54:42.790
it was a pretty decent one.

7199
02:54:43.330 --> 02:54:45.280
Beat Antonio Tarver remember that?

7200
02:54:46.140 --> 02:54:46.400
Yeah.

7201
02:54:46.400 --> 02:54:47.590
I spend a lot of fucking guys,

7202
02:54:47.591 --> 02:54:47.890
man.

7203
02:54:47.890 --> 02:54:50.830
Tarvaris fighting at heavyweight now he's he back.

7204
02:54:51.040 --> 02:54:51.873
Oh yeah.

7205
02:54:51.880 --> 02:54:52.960
How does he look at heavyweight?

7206
02:54:53.290 --> 02:54:53.540
Oh,

7207
02:54:53.540 --> 02:54:53.951
he's good.

7208
02:54:53.951 --> 02:54:54.701
He's training hard.

7209
02:54:54.701 --> 02:54:54.911
I mean,

7210
02:54:54.911 --> 02:54:56.330
I'm friends with him as well and uh,

7211
02:54:56.890 --> 02:54:57.140
his,

7212
02:54:57.140 --> 02:54:57.370
he's,

7213
02:54:57.370 --> 02:54:58.203
how old is he?

7214
02:54:58.540 --> 02:54:59.360
Tarver is I'm,

7215
02:54:59.360 --> 02:54:59.920
it's my,

7216
02:54:59.920 --> 02:55:00.190
yeah,

7217
02:55:00.190 --> 02:55:00.881
he's 45.

7218
02:55:00.881 --> 02:55:03.310
He's 44 45 it was 46.

7219
02:55:03.560 --> 02:55:04.280
46

7220
02:55:04.280 --> 02:55:05.360
<v 4>even that's old.</v>

7221
02:55:06.230 --> 02:55:06.530
Yeah.

7222
02:55:06.530 --> 02:55:07.071
But again,

7223
02:55:07.071 --> 02:55:07.640
you know,

7224
02:55:07.640 --> 02:55:08.420
to be fighting.

7225
02:55:08.420 --> 02:55:09.253
He's calling out,

7226
02:55:09.500 --> 02:55:11.110
calling out Klitschko everyday.

7227
02:55:11.170 --> 02:55:11.930
Is He?

7228
02:55:11.930 --> 02:55:12.261
I think he's,

7229
02:55:12.261 --> 02:55:12.531
you know,

7230
02:55:12.531 --> 02:55:14.630
he's trying to get that paycheck before he can get out of there.

7231
02:55:14.660 --> 02:55:15.980
How good is he still?

7232
02:55:16.340 --> 02:55:16.791
He's still,

7233
02:55:16.791 --> 02:55:17.001
he's,

7234
02:55:17.001 --> 02:55:19.850
I mean he knocked out the last guy he fought and he did it two weeks ago.

7235
02:55:20.840 --> 02:55:21.440
Wow.

7236
02:55:21.440 --> 02:55:24.760
46 there's a difference though with heavyweights,

7237
02:55:24.770 --> 02:55:25.090
right?

7238
02:55:25.090 --> 02:55:25.481
That hey,

7239
02:55:25.481 --> 02:55:26.750
we seem to mature later.

7240
02:55:26.751 --> 02:55:27.501
Like George Foreman,

7241
02:55:27.501 --> 02:55:31.200
when the tile at 46 44

7242
02:55:31.680 --> 02:55:35.600
<v 7>46 he knocked out Michael Morgan was a 44 oh one thing.</v>

7243
02:55:35.760 --> 02:55:36.690
I would double check that.

7244
02:55:36.720 --> 02:55:36.871
Well,

7245
02:55:36.871 --> 02:55:38.490
you are a fucking boxing wizard.

7246
02:55:38.491 --> 02:55:40.020
Ordinarily I'd go shut up bitch.

7247
02:55:40.870 --> 02:55:42.720
And you know more about boxing than I do.

7248
02:55:42.890 --> 02:55:44.040
I think it was 44

7249
02:55:45.550 --> 02:55:45.821
okay,

7250
02:55:45.821 --> 02:55:46.591
let's find out too,

7251
02:55:46.591 --> 02:55:46.771

7252
02:55:46.771 --> 02:55:48.940
too too too too.

7253
02:55:50.170 --> 02:55:55.170
George Foreman Big George [inaudible] and it's two two two two two second

7254
02:55:57.011 --> 02:56:00.640
retirement professional boxing record.

7255
02:56:00.641 --> 02:56:01.810
Let's see.

7256
02:56:03.440 --> 02:56:06.860
I'm Michael Moore.

7257
02:56:07.250 --> 02:56:07.710
Yup.

7258
02:56:07.710 --> 02:56:12.710
K O and round 10 and that was in 1994 that was 20 years ago.

7259
02:56:15.410 --> 02:56:15.681
Wow,

7260
02:56:15.681 --> 02:56:16.341
that's crazy.

7261
02:56:16.341 --> 02:56:17.660
Already on the day.

7262
02:56:17.750 --> 02:56:18.740
He is.

7263
02:56:23.330 --> 02:56:23.750
<v 0>Okay.</v>

7264

<v 7>How old is he?</v>

7265
02:56:25.220 --> 02:56:30.220
Should be 64 65 so he was either 45 or 46 or it could have been 44 it might've

7266
02:56:32.091 --> 02:56:33.740
been 44 going on 45 let's see.

7267
02:56:33.741 --> 02:56:35.540
January 10th is his birthday.

7268
02:56:35.541 --> 02:56:36.890

No,

7282
02:57:05.091 --> 02:57:05.924
you're making things up.

7283
02:57:06.170 --> 02:57:06.291
Oh,

7284
02:57:06.291 --> 02:57:07.124
Shit.

7285
02:57:07.370 --> 02:57:08.610
January,

7286
02:57:08.610 --> 02:57:08.610
February,

7287
02:57:08.610 --> 02:57:08.610
March,

7288
02:57:08.610 --> 02:57:09.030
April.

7289
02:57:09.030 --> 02:57:10.370
I'm born before,

7290
02:57:10.371 --> 02:57:10.900
so yeah.

7291
02:57:10.900 --> 02:57:11.070
Uh,

7292
02:57:11.070 --> 02:57:13.490
that would be 46 46 yeah.

7293
02:57:14.490 --> 02:57:18.140
A 45 45 45 we split the difference.

7294
02:57:18.230 --> 02:57:18.441
Yeah.

7295
02:57:18.441 --> 02:57:21.470
10 years later he announced it come back and in November,

7296
02:57:21.470 --> 02:57:22.340
1994 at age 45,

7297
02:57:22.341 --> 02:57:26.480
he regained the heavyweight championship by knocking out 27 year old Michael

7298
02:57:26.480 --> 02:57:26.930
Moore.

7299
02:57:26.930 --> 02:57:31.930
<v 4>I remember when he started his come back in [inaudible] 88 or 89 or 98 1889 I</v>

7300
02:57:32.601 --> 02:57:32.990
think.

7301
02:57:32.990 --> 02:57:33.823
[inaudible] 88

7302
02:57:34.400 --> 02:57:34.830
<v 0>yeah.</v>

7303
02:57:34.830 --> 02:57:36.690
<v 7>He's the oldest ever heavyweight champion.</v>

7304
02:57:36.691 --> 02:57:40.950
And second oldest in any weight class after Bernard Hopkins who retired in 97 at

7305
02:57:40.951 --> 02:57:44.640
the age of 48 with a final record of 76 and five,

7306
02:57:44.641 --> 02:57:46.260
including 68 knockouts.

7307
02:57:46.860 --> 02:57:47.693
Credible.

7308
02:57:48.970 --> 02:57:49.450
<v 4>Well,</v>

7309
02:57:49.450 --> 02:57:49.820
didn't he?

7310
02:57:49.820 --> 02:57:51.050
He never ended up fighting Larry Holmes.

7311
02:57:51.060 --> 02:57:51.880
Diddy.

7312
02:57:51.880 --> 02:57:54.430
I do not believe he ever fought Larry Holmes and where they were calling each

7313
02:57:54.431 --> 02:57:56.770
other out at that age where they both when they were older.

7314
02:57:56.800 --> 02:57:57.633
Yeah.

7315
02:57:57.710 --> 02:57:58.060
Larry.

7316
02:57:58.060 --> 02:57:59.880
And then Larry Holmes called Trevor Berbick number.

7317
02:57:59.881 --> 02:58:01.120
He ran over a car and kicked Trevor.

7318
02:58:02.190 --> 02:58:03.023
<v 2>Yes.</v>

7319
02:58:03.500 --> 02:58:04.140
Rob kicked him.

7320
02:58:04.140 --> 02:58:04.261
Oh,

7321
02:58:04.261 --> 02:58:05.041
we're running out of time.

7322
02:58:05.041 --> 02:58:08.420
Do we have one minute to go raw so motherfucking Peter's.
