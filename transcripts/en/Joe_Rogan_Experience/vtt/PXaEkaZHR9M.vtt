1
00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Freak bitches,</v>

2
00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.310
<v Speaker 1>so it's an issue.</v>

3
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:04.600
<v Speaker 1>I would,</v>

4
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.770
<v Speaker 1>I would encourage people,</v>

5
00:00:05.771 --> 00:00:09.880
<v Speaker 1>especially maybe people that are prone to cancer or people who have had cancer</v>

6
00:00:09.881 --> 00:00:13.570
<v Speaker 1>in the past and maybe had treated and are kind of in a state of remission.</v>

7
00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:14.560
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

8
00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:15.400
<v Speaker 1>if you go,</v>

9
00:00:15.401 --> 00:00:17.380
<v Speaker 1>if you get your body into that,</v>

10
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.130
<v Speaker 1>what we call the metabolic zone where the level of ketones are higher than the</v>

11
00:00:21.131 --> 00:00:25.630
<v Speaker 1>level of glucose that puts tremendous metabolic stress on cancer cells or</v>

12
00:00:25.631 --> 00:00:29.770
<v Speaker 1>precancerous cells that have a huge appetite for glucose.</v>

13
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.410
<v Speaker 1>So and that contribute can,</v>

14
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.630
<v Speaker 1>can initiate autophagy.</v>

15
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.220
<v Speaker 1>So even people who do not have cancer perhaps don't want to just make sure</v>

16
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.620
<v Speaker 1>they're holding off of it as a preventative maintenance.</v>

17
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:42.160
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

18
00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.160
<v Speaker 1>And I think it can stimulate almost purge your body of cancer cells that are</v>

19
00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:52.960
<v Speaker 1>weakened by in this fasted state and also precancerous cells that may be in the</v>

20
00:00:52.961 --> 00:00:54.220
<v Speaker 1>transition of trends.</v>

21
00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.890
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

22
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.460
<v Speaker 1>differentiating into this no cancer cells.</v>

23
00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.740
<v Speaker 1>These cells are very energy demanding,</v>

24
00:00:59.741 --> 00:01:01.090
<v Speaker 1>especially if they're replicating.</v>

25
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.120
<v Speaker 1>And if you deprive them of energy,</v>

26
00:01:04.121 --> 00:01:08.740
<v Speaker 1>the quote unquote energy crisis signal that these cells receive can,</v>

27
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.770
<v Speaker 1>can initiate a program cell death we call Apap ptosis and autophagy.</v>

28
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.510
<v Speaker 1>And that's the benefit of this.</v>

29
00:01:16.511 --> 00:01:17.770
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like housekeeping.</v>

30
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.670
<v Speaker 1>So think about it,</v>

31
00:01:18.671 --> 00:01:18.821
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:18.821 --> 00:01:23.070
<v Speaker 1>you accumulate a lot of dead cells that are kind of sluggish or mitochondria</v>

33
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.711
<v Speaker 1>kind of sluggish,</v>

34
00:01:23.711 --> 00:01:26.050
<v Speaker 1>and then you fast for a week and it's like reboot.</v>

35
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like a setting.</v>

36
00:01:27.311 --> 00:01:28.420
<v Speaker 1>It's like a reset button.</v>

37
00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.593
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

38
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.883
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

39
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.330
<v Speaker 1>Another one was a Norwegian man,</v>

40
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:36.793
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

41
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.550
<v Speaker 1>has spent 40 years amassing of,</v>

42
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:44.870
<v Speaker 1>of a valuable stamp collection on his bespoke porn film.</v>

43
00:01:45.081 --> 00:01:45.771
<v Speaker 1>Was descent.</v>

44
00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:50.771
<v Speaker 1>His stamp collection to the valley with three naked porn women would destroy his</v>

45
00:01:53.481 --> 00:01:54.500
<v Speaker 1>stamp collection.</v>

46
00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:56.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

47
00:01:56.291 --> 00:01:56.680
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

48
00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:56.991
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

49
00:01:56.991 --> 00:01:58.040
<v Speaker 1>That's a still from it.</v>

50
00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm A.</v>

51
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:00.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

52
00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.480
<v Speaker 1>How much does the stamp collection worth?</v>

53
00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

54
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:03.783
<v Speaker 1>live?</v>

55
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

56
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.190
<v Speaker 1>it turns out because we managed to track down stamps,</v>

57
00:02:07.191 --> 00:02:08.000
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

58
00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.420
<v Speaker 1>And he talked to us after a lot of persuasion.</v>

59
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.680
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

60
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.810
<v Speaker 1>and he's got 10 books of stamps.</v>

61
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.291
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

62
00:02:15.291 --> 00:02:19.160
<v Speaker 1>once a year he sends one to accustom producer.</v>

63
00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.593
<v Speaker 1>And so does it.</v>

64
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.160
<v Speaker 1>So that's his thing.</v>

65
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.491
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

66
00:02:22.491 --> 00:02:27.200
<v Speaker 1>it turns out it's because he grew up in Iceland where stamp collecting was a</v>

67
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.770
<v Speaker 1>popular hobby at the time in like the seventies and the eighties.</v>

68
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.960
<v Speaker 1>A stamp collecting was big.</v>

69
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.153
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

70
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

71
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.710
<v Speaker 1>he became like an obsessive stamp collector.</v>

72
00:02:36.711 --> 00:02:38.150
<v Speaker 1>The stamps shop owners would say,</v>

73
00:02:38.151 --> 00:02:38.271
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

74
00:02:38.271 --> 00:02:39.870
<v Speaker 1>if you buy the standards can be Bay valley,</v>

75
00:02:39.871 --> 00:02:40.940
<v Speaker 1>but in 20 years,</v>

76
00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.400
<v Speaker 1>but then came the internet and it killed off the stump.</v>

77
00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.100
<v Speaker 1>Is it killed off stamp collecting as a hobby light?</v>

78
00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

79
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.520
<v Speaker 1>nerds apparently felt like over other things to be interested in.</v>

80
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.350
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

81
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.810
<v Speaker 1>the thrill of the chase just wasn't there anymore.</v>

82
00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:56.690
<v Speaker 1>Like you can easily pack.</v>

83
00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

84
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:57.980
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

85
00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.830
<v Speaker 1>so his stamps lost all their value.</v>

86
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.020
<v Speaker 1>The stamp stores closed down,</v>

87
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.100
<v Speaker 1>that kind of collegial atmosphere of fellow stamp collectors just vanished.</v>

88
00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.080
<v Speaker 1>He began to like,</v>

89
00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

90
00:03:08.391 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 1>regret his life choices of like spending all that time and money collecting</v>

91
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:13.510
<v Speaker 1>stamps.</v>

92
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.190
<v Speaker 1>He began to feel depressed and isolated.</v>

93
00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.260
<v Speaker 1>So he went to see a psychiatrist who told them that stamp collecting is a</v>

94
00:03:20.491 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous hobby</v>

95
00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.150
<v Speaker 1>because it isolates him.</v>

96
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.140
<v Speaker 1>So now he pays porn people to destroy his stamps.</v>

97
00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.180
<v Speaker 1>The psychiatrist told them that a hobby is ridiculous according to him,</v>

98
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.220
<v Speaker 1>and I never talked to the psychiatrist,</v>

99
00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:37.241
<v Speaker 1>but according to him,</v>

100
00:03:37.241 --> 00:03:37.451
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

101
00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:39.350
<v Speaker 1>he said that stamp collecting is ridiculous.</v>

102
00:03:39.351 --> 00:03:40.020
<v Speaker 1>Hobby</v>

103
00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.600
<v Speaker 2>seems like a ridiculous thing for a psychologist to say.</v>

104
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.200
<v Speaker 2>Sounds bad.</v>

105
00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.300
<v Speaker 2>Psychologist enjoys it.</v>

106
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

107
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:47.290
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>

108
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.640
<v Speaker 2>if you have all your ducks in a row and everything's firing on all cylinders,</v>

109
00:03:51.641 --> 00:03:53.560
<v Speaker 2>but you really truly enjoy stamps.</v>

110
00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:54.753
<v Speaker 2>Who's,</v>

111
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.040
<v Speaker 2>who's to tell you there's something wrong with that?</v>

112
00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.461
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

113
00:03:57.461 --> 00:03:57.800
<v Speaker 2>the only.</v>

114
00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

115
00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.950
<v Speaker 2>one good thing that came out of it was,</v>

116
00:03:59.951 --> 00:04:00.784
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

117
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.650
<v Speaker 2>he really enriched the imaginations of the people in the valley and also my</v>

118
00:04:07.181 --> 00:04:07.961
<v Speaker 2>imagination too.</v>

119
00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:08.794
<v Speaker 2>I mean stamps.</v>

120
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.270
<v Speaker 2>But one of the things that I used to see early on that was so confusing to me</v>

121
00:04:13.271 --> 00:04:17.080
<v Speaker 2>because I came from a striking background was how many of these guys were</v>

122
00:04:17.081 --> 00:04:21.820
<v Speaker 2>willing to beat the fuck out of each other in the gym and like that there were</v>

123
00:04:21.821 --> 00:04:26.821
<v Speaker 2>just going to war but not even going to war with like good skills,</v>

124
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.920
<v Speaker 2>like going to war while there were learning for the sake of war.</v>

125
00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.311
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

126
00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:30.631
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

127
00:04:30.631 --> 00:04:33.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm watching them getting coached and they're beating the shit.</v>

128
00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.701
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

129
00:04:33.701 --> 00:04:35.530
<v Speaker 2>you guys are professionals.</v>

130
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:36.910
<v Speaker 2>Like this isn't like,</v>

131
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.070
<v Speaker 2>this isn't like some idiots at the y.</v>

132
00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

133
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:40.523
<v Speaker 2>you guys are,</v>

134
00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.810
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to be pros like you can damage yourself.</v>

135
00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.940
<v Speaker 2>The van take years off of your career.</v>

136
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.940
<v Speaker 3>The vast majority of me working with athletes is doing these very,</v>

137
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:52.720
<v Speaker 3>very basic things.</v>

138
00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:53.590
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm not,</v>

139
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:54.401
<v Speaker 3>I'm asking not.</v>

140
00:04:54.401 --> 00:04:55.180
<v Speaker 3>The Guru was like,</v>

141
00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.331
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

142
00:04:55.331 --> 00:04:56.060
<v Speaker 3>I know the,</v>

143
00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.360
<v Speaker 3>the 18 point blood tests and we're going to get these.</v>

144
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:00.340
<v Speaker 3>The vast majority of what I do is go,</v>

145
00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:01.241
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

146
00:05:01.241 --> 00:05:01.481
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

147
00:05:01.481 --> 00:05:02.314
<v Speaker 3>I see the problem here.</v>

148
00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:03.010
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

149
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:04.540
<v Speaker 3>we need to do this basic thing.</v>

150
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:05.553
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

151
00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.880
<v Speaker 3>You haven't eaten a vegetable in a week.</v>

152
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:07.610
<v Speaker 3>Got It.</v>

153
00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.060
<v Speaker 3>Like that as not as much anymore.</v>

154
00:05:10.061 --> 00:05:11.230
<v Speaker 3>But I used to really?</v>

155
00:05:11.231 --> 00:05:11.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

156
00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.730
<v Speaker 3>We get a lot of the pro athlete that doesn't eat vegetables.</v>

157
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:15.640
<v Speaker 3>We get is honestly,</v>

158
00:05:15.641 --> 00:05:18.280
<v Speaker 3>it's because probably because assholes like you and they want your show or</v>

159
00:05:18.281 --> 00:05:19.114
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

160
00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.810
<v Speaker 2>I tell people to eat vegetables all the time.</v>

161
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:22.240
<v Speaker 3>No they weren't.</v>

162
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.150
<v Speaker 3>They watched this and then like,</v>

163
00:05:23.151 --> 00:05:23.391
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

164
00:05:23.391 --> 00:05:26.990
<v Speaker 3>and I'll come at me with a thousand really weird nutrition questions or</v>

165
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.351
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

166
00:05:27.351 --> 00:05:29.780
<v Speaker 3>a really weird advanced training ones because they went to a seminar or</v>

167
00:05:29.781 --> 00:05:30.531
<v Speaker 3>something and I'm like,</v>

168
00:05:30.531 --> 00:05:33.470
<v Speaker 3>back the train up like you're sparring six times a week.</v>

169
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.770
<v Speaker 3>We've got a whole nother conversation like,</v>

170
00:05:36.771 --> 00:05:36.891
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

171
00:05:36.891 --> 00:05:37.890
<v Speaker 3>we don't do that now.</v>

172
00:05:37.891 --> 00:05:38.540
<v Speaker 3>That's not normal.</v>

173
00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:39.470
<v Speaker 3>Really know,</v>

174
00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:40.363
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

175
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.890
<v Speaker 3>or you're doing that or you're running 35 miles a week.</v>

176
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:44.383
<v Speaker 3>Got It.</v>

177
00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.410
<v Speaker 3>That's the vast majority of what I do is,</v>

178
00:05:46.411 --> 00:05:48.350
<v Speaker 3>is bring these guys back to life and go like,</v>

179
00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.310
<v Speaker 3>let me help you sift through all this internet stuff that's really complicated</v>

180
00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:57.140
<v Speaker 3>and let's take what's actually good and bad and dial in a very usable.</v>

181
00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.190
<v Speaker 3>So I think</v>

182
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.680
<v Speaker 2>people just get overwhelmed with options for me.</v>

183
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:01.041
<v Speaker 2>Internet.</v>

184
00:06:01.041 --> 00:06:01.874
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

185
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:07.070
<v Speaker 2>Because too many people get on exposure again on shows or platforms and they try</v>

186
00:06:07.071 --> 00:06:07.750
<v Speaker 2>to make sure that,</v>

187
00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.340
<v Speaker 2>that they are known as the guy that knows something different.</v>

188
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:11.323
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

189
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.841
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

190
00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:12.200
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

191
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

192
00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:13.890
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's not very excited if I come up here and tell you like,</v>

193
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:14.050
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

194
00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:15.320
<v Speaker 2>Joel has pros and cons to everything.</v>

195
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.910
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

196
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:17.061
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

197
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:17.894
<v Speaker 2>well that's not fun.</v>

198
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.401
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

199
00:06:19.401 --> 00:06:20.234
<v Speaker 2>And we're live.</v>

200
00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:20.830
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

201
00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:21.441
<v Speaker 2>You survive.</v>

202
00:06:21.441 --> 00:06:22.170
<v Speaker 2>What's up buddy?</v>

203
00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:23.003
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

204
00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:25.220
<v Speaker 2>he survived the Joey Diaz experience.</v>

205
00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.591
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

206
00:06:25.591 --> 00:06:27.120
<v Speaker 3>I got gotta I got a um,</v>

207
00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:28.120
<v Speaker 3>I got uh,</v>

208
00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:29.760
<v Speaker 3>a text from Tom.</v>

209
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:30.663
<v Speaker 3>Tom.</v>

210
00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:31.681
<v Speaker 3>Tom,</v>

211
00:06:31.681 --> 00:06:32.060
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

212
00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

213
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:33.810
<v Speaker 3>I said because he asked me,</v>

214
00:06:33.811 --> 00:06:37.110
<v Speaker 3>we were backstage about to go onstage at the main room and he's like,</v>

215
00:06:37.470 --> 00:06:38.670
<v Speaker 3>I want you to do my podcast,</v>

216
00:06:38.671 --> 00:06:39.390
<v Speaker 3>blah blah blah.</v>

217
00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:40.350
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like awesome.</v>

218
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:45.180
<v Speaker 3>And then we were texting just about my schedule with him and then he's.</v>

219
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.811
<v Speaker 3>And then I'm like,</v>

220
00:06:45.811 --> 00:06:46.141
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

221
00:06:46.141 --> 00:06:48.120
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to go see Joey Diaz de da.</v>

222
00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:48.571
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

223
00:06:48.571 --> 00:06:49.051
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

224
00:06:49.051 --> 00:06:50.130
<v Speaker 3>fucking gummy bears.</v>

225
00:06:50.131 --> 00:06:50.964
<v Speaker 3>Watch out.</v>

226
00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:51.691
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

227
00:06:51.691 --> 00:06:52.501
<v Speaker 3>what are you talking about?</v>

228
00:06:52.501 --> 00:06:53.010
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like,</v>

229
00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:54.730
<v Speaker 3>I didn't understand what he was talking about.</v>

230
00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:55.760
<v Speaker 3>Like I didn't,</v>

231
00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:56.371
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

232
00:06:56.371 --> 00:06:56.701
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>

233
00:06:56.701 --> 00:06:58.020
<v Speaker 3>I honestly didn't like,</v>

234
00:06:58.021 --> 00:06:58.351
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

235
00:06:58.351 --> 00:06:58.741
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

236
00:06:58.741 --> 00:06:59.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't what you're talking about.</v>

237
00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.200
<v Speaker 3>And then once I got there,</v>

238
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:01.741
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

239
00:07:01.741 --> 00:07:03.210
<v Speaker 3>I smoke weed sometimes,</v>

240
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:03.451
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

241
00:07:03.451 --> 00:07:06.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't smoke all the time but I like to smoke weed sometimes,</v>

242
00:07:06.750 --> 00:07:07.170
<v Speaker 3>but the.</v>

243
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:08.700
<v Speaker 3>But as far as the edibles,</v>

244
00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.500
<v Speaker 3>I like Dean Gelber.</v>

245
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.560
<v Speaker 3>It's given me some pot stuff but like cookies and shit,</v>

246
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.340
<v Speaker 3>but then like he was eating these gummy bears and they in,</v>

247
00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.510
<v Speaker 3>in a bag and I was like,</v>

248
00:07:18.511 --> 00:07:18.901
<v Speaker 3>going,</v>

249
00:07:18.901 --> 00:07:19.351
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

250
00:07:19.351 --> 00:07:19.801
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

251
00:07:19.801 --> 00:07:20.930
<v Speaker 3>And he gave me just like,</v>

252
00:07:20.931 --> 00:07:21.764
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

253
00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:25.950
<v Speaker 3>he gave me just like an ear or some shit and that was it.</v>

254
00:07:25.951 --> 00:07:29.610
<v Speaker 3>And then I was just like talking to them and then like literally I couldn't talk</v>

255
00:07:29.611 --> 00:07:30.444
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

256
00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:34.110
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't talk part of it it a half a one,</v>

257
00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:36.330
<v Speaker 3>Scott had to leave.</v>

258
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.560
<v Speaker 2>He's got some that are like 500 milligrams,</v>

259
00:07:39.561 --> 00:07:41.930
<v Speaker 2>which is just insane.</v>

260
00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:44.060
<v Speaker 2>So you probably had half of that,</v>

261
00:07:44.061 --> 00:07:45.350
<v Speaker 2>which is like 250,</v>

262
00:07:45.351 --> 00:07:46.760
<v Speaker 2>which is fucking insane.</v>

263
00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.530
<v Speaker 2>That's an insane amount of weed.</v>

264
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.513
<v Speaker 2>But unless you're an okay,</v>

265
00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:49.830
<v Speaker 3>gee,</v>

266
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:49.981
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

267
00:07:49.981 --> 00:07:50.260
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

268
00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:55.060
<v Speaker 3>but I had done mushrooms once before when I was younger and it felt like that.</v>

269
00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:55.430
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

270
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:56.263
<v Speaker 3>Well that's,</v>

271
00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:57.770
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

272
00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:00.210
<v Speaker 2>to the risk of repeating myself over and over again,</v>

273
00:08:00.211 --> 00:08:01.140
<v Speaker 2>which I do all the time,</v>

274
00:08:01.141 --> 00:08:03.480
<v Speaker 2>but when you eat marijuana,</v>

275
00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:07.800
<v Speaker 2>it's processed by your liver and it produces something called 11 hydroxy</v>

276
00:08:07.801 --> 00:08:08.634
<v Speaker 2>metabolite.</v>

277
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:11.130
<v Speaker 2>It's a totally different psychoactive substance sets,</v>

278
00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:14.280
<v Speaker 2>four to five times more psychoactive than thc.</v>

279
00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:18.900
<v Speaker 2>So that's why it hits you like that and that's why people think they got dosed</v>

280
00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.210
<v Speaker 2>because when you smoke pot that the,</v>

281
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.460
<v Speaker 2>it's not psychoactive,</v>

282
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:24.630
<v Speaker 2>but when you eat it,</v>

283
00:08:24.631 --> 00:08:27.420
<v Speaker 2>it's processed by your liver and something called a one pass.</v>

284
00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:28.140
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

285
00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:29.340
<v Speaker 2>that's how it produces that.</v>

286
00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:29.591
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

287
00:08:29.591 --> 00:08:31.390
<v Speaker 3>And I can't believe he let me drive home.</v>

288
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:32.531
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

289
00:08:32.531 --> 00:08:33.364
<v Speaker 3>seriously.</v>

290
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:34.500
<v Speaker 3>I mean I could like.</v>

291
00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:36.280
<v Speaker 3>Because when I was driving home I was like,</v>

292
00:08:36.281 --> 00:08:36.491

<v Speaker 2>He doesn't give a shit.</v>
