WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.870
Wild pig or something.
Yeah.

2
00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.890
My buddy from Australia gave me those and that head.

3
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.680
It's an Asian water buffalo.
It's an invasive species.
We live.
Oh,

4
00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.330
it worked.
Jesus Christ.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
the UFC performance institute boys.

5
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.200
Hey,
what's this duck and Forrest Griffin.
Forrest Griffin.
Good to see you.

6
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.740
We've already talked over each other.
So guarded,
bloated.
No,
we've got it.

7
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.510
We've got it nailed.
Um,
well I'm really glad you guys are here because of,

8
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.730
I was blown away when I went to visit the,
you know,

9
00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:32.560
you hear the performance institute and you go,

10
00:00:32.561 --> 00:00:35.080
well what is this going to be like?
You go,
they were like,
oh my God.

11
00:00:35.081 --> 00:00:35.801
They thought of everything.

12
00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:40.570
It's like the ultimate state of the art facility for training,
for recovery,
for,

13
00:00:40.571 --> 00:00:42.850
for nutrition.
It's fucking amazing.

14
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.870
I mean it was three that we're posting the link to that Shit.
Right?
Say it,
dude.

15
00:00:46.871 --> 00:00:50.260
I mean it's,
it's amazing when,
when we went on a tour and check that place out,

16
00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.150
I think it was the delegates who was with me.
Yeah.
We were like,
Holy Shit,

17
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.910
I can't imagine you have access to this fucking place.

18
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.880
Like you guys have really created something special.
It's very interesting.

19
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.950
And I don't know much about other sports,

20
00:01:02.951 --> 00:01:05.320
but I know this never really existed in combat sports before.

21
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:06.670
Something like this.
That's,

22
00:01:06.671 --> 00:01:10.540
I mean you guys have athletes from all sorts of different walks of life come

23
00:01:10.541 --> 00:01:12.130
through there.
And when I was there,
there was many,

24
00:01:12.131 --> 00:01:15.310
many top level fighters that were training out of there.
It's really,

25
00:01:15.311 --> 00:01:16.144
really interesting.

26
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.880
<v 1>Yeah.
Cool.
Well we appreciate the kind words obviously.
Um,
I mean ultimately,
yeah,</v>

27
00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:21.331
the,
the,

28
00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:25.030
the vision of the UFC was to build a performance institute that was truly a

29
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.890
world class high performance center that has everything that fighters would,

30
00:01:28.891 --> 00:01:29.500
would need.

31
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.900
And not only are we trying to align ourselves as the leaders in mixed martial

32
00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:38.340
arts,
but certainly leaders in human high performance can tell people what you do

33
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.920
there.
Explain.
Yeah.
So my role is the vice president of performance.
Um,

34
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.890
I essentially direct the,
the,

35
00:01:45.891 --> 00:01:48.300
the philosophy of how are we going to interact with the fighters,

36
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.370
how are we going to support the fight is and obviously manage our,

37
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.320
our world class staff that are working within the performance facility.

38
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.630
<v 0>And Clint,
you,</v>

39
00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.860
you came from a background in amateur wrestling and uh,

40
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.400
tell everybody like what your job is about.

41
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.840
<v 1>Yep.
So I'm the director of performance nutrition,</v>

42
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.350
so anything related to feeding of athletes,

43
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.280
it's essentially managed by myself and our ever expanding team.

44
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.670
So it could be as broad as working with athletes for their general training

45
00:02:17.831 --> 00:02:18.101
plan,

46
00:02:18.101 --> 00:02:23.101
integrating within the other performance services as well as feeding athletes on

47
00:02:23.141 --> 00:02:26.170
the ground,
integrating with in our kitchen at the performance institute,

48
00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.500
I'm supporting athletes as they prepare for for fight week,
wait,
descends,

49
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.300
et cetera.

50
00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.990
And then supporting athletes on fight week and preparing at that even at the

51
00:02:34.991 --> 00:02:38.590
last moment of fight day to fuel up and to be really well fueled for their

52
00:02:38.591 --> 00:02:41.650
performance.
My background is,
like you said,
an amateur wrestling.

53
00:02:41.651 --> 00:02:45.220
I wrestled and coached at Cornell University,
um,
graduated.

54
00:02:45.221 --> 00:02:49.180
No three was on the US national team with a number of actually core current

55
00:02:49.181 --> 00:02:52.300
fighters right now.
So core me at Daniel Cormier and a number of other athletes,

56
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.020
Chris Weidman and some others.
And I used to train together.
Um,

57
00:02:56.021 --> 00:02:58.360
and then I went back to school and got all my,

58
00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.190
my credentialing to be a registered

59
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.671
<v 2>Dietitian.</v>

60
00:03:00.671 --> 00:03:05.590
And so that's kind of led me through developing a program at Cornell to the UFC

61
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.160
with a pretty unique combination of the nutrition,

62
00:03:09.161 --> 00:03:13.930
the dietetics and then obviously the experience in combat sports and weight

63
00:03:13.931 --> 00:03:17.500
cutting.
Yeah.
And in my opinion,
the most grueling combat sport.

64
00:03:17.501 --> 00:03:20.740
I mean I think wrestling is just,
we talked about on the last podcast,
it's just,

65
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.390
it's crazy way for a kid to learn hard work and to learn real competition and

66
00:03:25.391 --> 00:03:25.960
the state,

67
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.530
the actual physical struggle of getting to wrestling practice and strength and

68
00:03:29.531 --> 00:03:33.340
conditioning grills.
Most kids that are coming up in high school and in college,

69
00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.990
they don't really work that hard in any other sport.
I mean it's,

70
00:03:36.991 --> 00:03:37.900
it's a crazy sport.

71
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.350
I remember in high school like walking into the wrestling room and it's a bunch

72
00:03:41.351 --> 00:03:42.260
of gross dudes.

73
00:03:42.261 --> 00:03:46.240
It's like in a sweaty hot room and then it was like basketball was right next to

74
00:03:46.241 --> 00:03:47.660
it.
I walked because the basketball,

75
00:03:47.661 --> 00:03:50.680
there's like dudes and tank tops and some like cheerleaders.
I'm like,

76
00:03:50.681 --> 00:03:55.210
I know what I'm doing.
Maybe it's
a little bit,

77
00:03:55.211 --> 00:03:58.870
I know little did you know?
Yeah.
I mean it's in my opinion still.

78
00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:02.350
I think it's the most important skill because you get to dictate where the fight

79
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:03.130
takes place.

80
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.340
There's no one skill that really overpowers all except for the ability to hold

81
00:04:07.341 --> 00:04:10.750
the guy down.
The ability to hold someone down and control them on the ground.

82
00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:13.030
It's so critical and everything else you can learn from that.

83
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.490
Submissions ground and pound,
but the,
the,
the difference in like a,

84
00:04:17.491 --> 00:04:20.530
an elite wrestler like yourself and a person who doesn't have that skill.

85
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.760
It's so hard to bridge that gap.
It is hard to learn later in life.

86
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.950
He's one of the few people that just like,

87
00:04:26.951 --> 00:04:30.700
I'll just take this up and be amazing cause I'm GSP and then I'll become a

88
00:04:30.701 --> 00:04:33.220
gymnast.
Who knows?
I think that's a thing with him though.

89
00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:34.570
He had such physical abilities.

90
00:04:34.571 --> 00:04:37.990
We were talking about this almost on the last podcast as well that he used to do

91
00:04:37.991 --> 00:04:40.240
that karate blitz,
you know,
so he was,

92
00:04:40.241 --> 00:04:43.090
he was so used to that lunging in stuff that he's sort of incorporated that with

93
00:04:43.091 --> 00:04:47.590
a blast double and he's so physically strong.
It's such a smart dude and so,

94
00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.670
so good at learning things that he just figured out the tech,

95
00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.580
the essential techniques and he needed to master and just got better and better

96
00:04:54.581 --> 00:04:56.710
at them way back in the day.

97
00:04:56.711 --> 00:05:01.590
Obviously UFC one was kind of a discipline versus discipline.
Uh,

98
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.300
kind of grudge match.
And,
and having been a lifelong wrestler,

99
00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:05.950
that's when I started tuning in and actually,

100
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.420
and taking pride in all the wrestlers,
taking names and,

101
00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:13.910
and grown within the sport.
And obviously with the evolution of the sport,
um,

102
00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.460
it's,
it's a different dynamic and obviously each athlete coming from their own

103
00:05:18.461 --> 00:05:21.370
discipline is really fun for us to work with as practitioners having their own

104
00:05:21.371 --> 00:05:22.300
kind of sport culture.

105
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:26.500
But wrestling is a obviously a core component to what each athlete is doing.

106
00:05:26.501 --> 00:05:29.860
And when I'm working with athletes and talking through their weekly training

107
00:05:29.861 --> 00:05:30.770
plan and you know,

108
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.720
how to feed and fuel for each of these types of training sessions and hearing

109
00:05:34.721 --> 00:05:37.090
them bitch about how hard those wrestling practices are,

110
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.330
I always get a little bit of a little bit of pride.
They're like,
yes,

111
00:05:40.331 --> 00:05:43.630
it is hard to imagine doing it for eight months straight for a college wrestling

112
00:05:43.631 --> 00:05:45.280
season and grind that out.
But it's,

113
00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.050
it's definitely been fun for me to watch wrestling as a component of MMA grow

114
00:05:50.051 --> 00:05:53.830
and,
and be able to contribute to,
uh,
to,
to the sport on a,

115
00:05:53.831 --> 00:05:56.020
on a few different kind of,
yeah.
I mean,

116
00:05:56.021 --> 00:05:58.310
I think the way always looked at it as pressure

117
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.690
<v 3>makes diamonds,
you know,
this is no other way you,
those,
those,
uh,</v>

118
00:06:02.691 --> 00:06:06.140
those hard nose dudes,
they come out of those environments.
They do.

119
00:06:06.141 --> 00:06:10.120
Like if you think about guys with crazy determination and,

120
00:06:10.121 --> 00:06:11.450
and mental fortitude,

121
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.880
there's a giant chunk of those you could attribute to wrestlers,

122
00:06:13.881 --> 00:06:16.010
but he's a lot of them and kickboxing and everything else as well.

123
00:06:16.011 --> 00:06:18.020
But there's just seems to be,

124
00:06:18.021 --> 00:06:21.170
it's such a unique sport in terms of hardening,

125
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.590
like your mental toughness for Shell.
I mean,

126
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:30.860
I wouldn't do it.
Fuck that.
Horrible.
I mean we at the performance institute,

127
00:06:30.861 --> 00:06:35.390
we always talk about Mahershala mixed martial arts as the decathlon of combat

128
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.440
sports.
Um,

129
00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.460
and I think our philosophy is to try and understand all the respective

130
00:06:40.461 --> 00:06:44.000
components that makes a world class MMA fighter.
And I think,
you know,

131
00:06:44.001 --> 00:06:47.560
if you're in the UFC,
you've got some certain x factors,
um,
that,

132
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:49.520
that allow you to be world class.
And you know,

133
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:51.650
wrestling is a huge component of that.

134
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.950
But what we try to do is understand limitations as well.

135
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.470
Because in a decathlon you're only ever as good as your weakest event.
Right?

136
00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.290
Right.
So if you're a striker,
if you're a grappler or if you're a wrestler,
um,

137
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.650
you know,

138
00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.570
we're trying to support each of those to understand how we can elevate the whole

139
00:07:05.571 --> 00:07:09.350
thing.
Now how much input do you put into fighters,
if any,

140
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.550
into how they incorporate their skills and like how they combine their skills

141
00:07:13.551 --> 00:07:17.960
together that you guys offer?
Like coaching on technique and approaches?

142
00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.860
<v 4>Yeah,
so break down the philosophy.
We don't do sports specific coaching,</v>

143
00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.820
so physical therapy,
sports nutrition,

144
00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:28.290
a strength and conditioning in sports science.

145
00:07:28.291 --> 00:07:32.130
And then Duncan oversees all those to make sure that their work.
All right.

146
00:07:32.131 --> 00:07:33.000
So our philosophy,

147
00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.960
anything that doesn't make you in the better in the octagon is pretty pointless.

148
00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:38.290
So what,

149
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.850
what I do is I'll just go over what your training schedule looks like with you

150
00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:46.920
and then,
you know,
where do we feed accordingly for this practice?
You know what?

151
00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.380
And then Roman,
our sports scientists,
when you can,

152
00:07:49.381 --> 00:07:52.380
you be recovered enough for this practice.
And that's,
you know,

153
00:07:52.381 --> 00:07:55.380
that's the philosophy.
So it's not specific.
You're thinking about it.

154
00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.550
If you guys are fighting and the performance institutes working with both you,

155
00:07:59.730 --> 00:08:02.640
we make you as big,
strong,
healthy,

156
00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:06.900
have the easiest time making weight,
go into your fight as fueled as you can.

157
00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:10.310
But if I start saying,
hey,
you know what,
I,
he's,

158
00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.180
he's pretty susceptible to late kicks.
Then it becomes,
you know,

159
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.920
now we can't support every athlete.
So when you talk to people,
it's just like,

160
00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:19.020
here's how to get the most out of your practices,
right?

161
00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:23.400
Here's the way to lay this out to just your training blocks.

162
00:08:23.401 --> 00:08:26.100
I don't think a lot of people understand like basic training,

163
00:08:26.101 --> 00:08:28.320
periodization leading up to a fight.

164
00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.540
And then that's the other problem with the UFC.

165
00:08:30.570 --> 00:08:32.850
You don't always have eight weeks,
10 weeks,
12 weeks,

166
00:08:32.851 --> 00:08:35.820
sometimes you've got four weeks.
And it's like,
all right,
well,
where's your,

167
00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:39.070
where's your wait?
Where are you at?
Where's your scale?
Where's it conditioning?

168
00:08:39.090 --> 00:08:43.060
How can we put those things together in time to get you ready on,
you know,

169
00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:47.960
but never specific like instruction on how to deal with the,

170
00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.900
and that's um,
it's almost like

171
00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:57.060
for a young to have the access,
first of all,

172
00:08:57.061 --> 00:08:59.950
just the access to the physical facility,
like the,

173
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:03.070
just all the different modalities you guys have and you know,

174
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:06.180
the strength and conditioning stuff and the,
the fact that you can,

175
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:07.380
one of the most impressive things,

176
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:11.340
impressive things was the camera set up around the octagon so they could film

177
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.090
sparring sequences and techniques,
sequences and the fight.

178
00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:16.930
Or you can back them up and rewind them and watch it and you can see,
oh,

179
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:19.560
see how you drop your leg here,
see how your,
you know,
your,

180
00:09:19.561 --> 00:09:23.070
your chin is up in the air and all these different,
different little factors.

181
00:09:23.071 --> 00:09:24.300
Thinking about the philosophy,
right?

182
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:29.040
You have to get close to game speed once or twice a week.
So for 15,
25 minutes,

183
00:09:29.041 --> 00:09:30.600
you're going to get,
you're going to risk injury,

184
00:09:30.601 --> 00:09:33.390
you're going to take physical damage that you're not getting paid for.

185
00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:37.200
Make the most out of it,
right?
Like review it,
treat it like a fight.

186
00:09:37.201 --> 00:09:40.600
Think about all athletes,
they fight two to four times a year.
So that's,

187
00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:43.560
that's a very limited amount of actual footage they have.

188
00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:47.010
But if you start recording your spine sessions and treating them like it,

189
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.830
like a fight,
like,
Asha,
I did this wrong,
I did that wrong,

190
00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.730
then you're going to end up with more like 80,
90,
which is,
you know,
baseball,

191
00:09:53.731 --> 00:09:58.080
basketball,
even football or that 20 plus games to,
you know,
review.
Yeah.

192
00:09:58.081 --> 00:10:01.140
And I think it's really important for young fighters also to see themselves

193
00:10:01.141 --> 00:10:03.420
doing certain techniques.
Like they might not notice.

194
00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:06.180
They might think they look better than they do.
Like,
it's good.

195
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.240
My coach was full of Shit,
man.
And then you log the film,
don't lie,

196
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.430
and you're like,
yeah,
oh,
okay.
I see what I'm doing wrong.

197
00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:15.360
It's hard sometimes to mimic,
you know,
without,
without actually seeing yourself.

198
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:18.210
Now you guys,
you been Forrest Griffin,

199
00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:21.660
former UFC champion and motherfucking world.
Uh,

200
00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:24.440
no one can ever take that from you,
sir.
How's that feel?
It's a beautiful thing.

201
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:29.160
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
No,
I've moved on.
I'm over it.
I'm now,

202
00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.970
I'm VP of athlete development at the performance institute.
So it's much,

203
00:10:32.971 --> 00:10:36.270
much more important.
But you still Forrest Griffin,
there's a lot of champions.

204
00:10:36.271 --> 00:10:38.220
There's only one v P of athlete develop.

205
00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.980
<v 5>Kind of find that job to figure out what it actually does change.
Right.</v>

206
00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:47.300
<v 4>Daily.
Don't worry about it.
Um,
you have been involved from the beginning of this,</v>

207
00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:51.320
right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh,
so it was going on about two weeks in,

208
00:10:51.321 --> 00:10:55.280
I heard this was happening and I was like,
oh,
hey guys,
I worked for you.

209
00:10:55.281 --> 00:10:56.750
I'm doing community outreach right now,

210
00:10:56.751 --> 00:11:00.710
but I've been trying to figure out the best way to train for mixed martial arts

211
00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:05.540
for the last 18 years.
I don't know.
Maybe give me a shot at it.
So,
yeah.

212
00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:10.400
Now when you,
when you say that,
that you're trying to figure out the best way,

213
00:11:10.401 --> 00:11:13.460
is there a best way?
Yes.
For everybody.
For every,

214
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.980
unfortunately it's this bullshit answers.
Everybody's different,
man.

215
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.850
Everybody's got a different ability to work,
you know,
like,
uh,

216
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:23.750
Uzma and might have x amount,
you know,
before he physically breaks down,

217
00:11:23.751 --> 00:11:27.200
because look at him.
He's a fucking Ferrari,
right?
He,
he,

218
00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.420
he needs more high end work or whatever.

219
00:11:29.421 --> 00:11:31.400
Everybody's a little physically different.

220
00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:36.470
The key is to get some objective feedback to know,
hey art,

221
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.990
I'm in the red.
I'm,
I'm good.
I'm not,
you know,
do you,

222
00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:42.650
do you guys do it on a heart rate,
heart rate variability?

223
00:11:42.651 --> 00:11:45.020
Like we need to determine whether or not someone's recovered?

224
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:46.300
Tell him about a mega wave.

225
00:11:47.270 --> 00:11:50.270
<v 5>Yeah,
I mean there's plenty of different ways to do it at the most,</v>

226
00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:54.010
the most basic level.
It's just speaking to a guy and get feedback.
Right.

227
00:11:54.011 --> 00:11:57.700
How are you feeling?
Is One of the best questions that we can ask her an athlete,

228
00:11:57.701 --> 00:11:59.020
but,
um,
yeah,
I mean we're,

229
00:11:59.021 --> 00:12:02.080
we're blessed and we're privileged with pretty high resource at the UFC

230
00:12:02.081 --> 00:12:05.500
performance institute.
So we have some pretty involved technologies.

231
00:12:05.501 --> 00:12:09.400
One of the ones that we use is as a system called mega wave and that gives us

232
00:12:09.401 --> 00:12:12.910
real insight and removes the subjectivity where it can get objective

233
00:12:12.911 --> 00:12:14.440
understanding around physiology,

234
00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:17.530
particularly looking at and the DC potential of the brain.

235
00:12:17.531 --> 00:12:20.610
So really see the DC potential.

236
00:12:20.630 --> 00:12:24.130
The brain is an assessment of the autonomic nervous system.
Yeah.

237
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.830
So if you look at,

238
00:12:26.831 --> 00:12:29.920
if you look at the parasympathetic and sympathetic balance of your body,

239
00:12:29.921 --> 00:12:31.840
we're talking science now.
I apologize.

240
00:12:31.841 --> 00:12:36.670
But ultimately that's one of the things that's really impacted.
There you go,

241
00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:39.240
Jamie pulled something up on the screen here.
John Smith,

242
00:12:39.241 --> 00:12:42.730
see windows of trainability.
This is fascinating.

243
00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:47.840
And so mega wave or is it something you were,
yeah,
so ultimately it's um,

244
00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:50.200
it's a three to five minute assessment.

245
00:12:50.201 --> 00:12:54.640
You wear something that resembles a heart rate strap laying at rest and we also

246
00:12:54.641 --> 00:12:58.480
have electrodes and Anya on,
on the third eye of your brain essentially.
Um,

247
00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:02.290
so we're picking up cardiovascular stress and we're picking up the autonomic

248
00:13:02.291 --> 00:13:04.750
nervous system and we're looking at things like heart rate variability,

249
00:13:04.751 --> 00:13:08.020
which you've already mentioned.
But so this isn't for everybody.

250
00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.350
Some people love it and they say,
hey man,
this is,
you know,
again,

251
00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:14.830
these are just tools,
right?
So different tools for different people,
right?
Yeah,

252
00:13:14.831 --> 00:13:18.160
for sure.
It's a,
it's a first thing in the morning measurement too,

253
00:13:18.161 --> 00:13:20.170
to understand your,
your recovery,

254
00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:24.250
how well you're recovering from the day before and those windows of trainability

255
00:13:24.251 --> 00:13:27.700
for the next day.
I think it all comes back to what far says.

256
00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:31.540
Ultimately what we're trying to do is understand individual responses.
Right?

257
00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.770
At the end of the day,
everyone's on a pathway of um,

258
00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:39.730
performance mastery to be a world champion.
And people respond to the workloads,

259
00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:41.890
the intensities,
the volumes in very different ways.

260
00:13:41.891 --> 00:13:45.070
If we take a basketball team and put them all through the same workout,

261
00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:48.550
you've got 15 different guys that are responding in very different ways to the

262
00:13:48.551 --> 00:13:50.680
same workout.
Um,
so we're,
we're,

263
00:13:50.681 --> 00:13:54.160
we're privileged in that we work with an individual sport and that's how,

264
00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:57.670
that's how our mantra is that we're looking at every single athlete is an

265
00:13:57.671 --> 00:13:59.530
individual and what building our programs,

266
00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:02.980
programming strategies and our information in an individual way.

267
00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:07.960
So you guys have been doing this now for how many years and we're coming up on

268
00:14:07.961 --> 00:14:10.990
two years on May 22nd is a,
is our second anniversary.

269
00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:13.650
And do you do to have like a,

270
00:14:13.651 --> 00:14:17.200
a log of all the different cases you worked with so you can kind of review like

271
00:14:17.201 --> 00:14:20.290
what methods were more effective than others and you're constantly trying to

272
00:14:20.291 --> 00:14:23.470
improve this protocol or how you guys,
how do you guys write it all out?

273
00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.830
I mean we've obviously been involved with numerous fight camps.
Um,

274
00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.500
but we're also working with fighters that are not in camp.
Um,

275
00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:34.320
last year we presented this,
um,
Journal,
our first journal,
which is a,

276
00:14:34.390 --> 00:14:37.810
an overview across section of all the data that we accrued in our first 12

277
00:14:37.811 --> 00:14:40.600
months and we continue to aggregate that data.

278
00:14:40.810 --> 00:14:43.960
Now one of the privileges that we have at the institute is we get the

279
00:14:43.961 --> 00:14:48.910
opportunity to work with just under 600 faces on our roster so we can create

280
00:14:48.911 --> 00:14:52.970
real clear cross section and awareness what different weight classes look like,

281
00:14:52.971 --> 00:14:56.300
what the challenges are to a fighter.
And then,
you know,

282
00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.570
the fighters can compare and contrast themselves against their immediate peers

283
00:14:59.571 --> 00:15:00.261
in their weight class.

284
00:15:00.261 --> 00:15:03.440
So that's one of the most powerful benchmarking tools you can create this or

285
00:15:03.441 --> 00:15:06.620
mega wave technology.
Can people buy that?
Oh yeah.

286
00:15:06.621 --> 00:15:10.070
It's just a commercial product off the shelf and it looks like it worked off an

287
00:15:10.071 --> 00:15:13.330
APP.
Like you,
you put an APP on your phone.
Yup.
Yup.

288
00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:16.280
Seems like it seems like that's the future.
But again,

289
00:15:16.281 --> 00:15:18.500
we use many different types of technologies.
You know,

290
00:15:18.890 --> 00:15:23.290
things like force plates can,
can look at neuro muscular responses.
Um,

291
00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:26.240
some of our nutrition variables will change across time.

292
00:15:26.241 --> 00:15:29.690
So it's not just one tool that has given us all the answers that the windows of

293
00:15:29.691 --> 00:15:33.230
trainability concept is something that really helps us on a day to day basis to

294
00:15:33.231 --> 00:15:37.550
understand can you go into a strength or power type session today and really

295
00:15:37.551 --> 00:15:40.730
maximize the opportunity to create that applications another day.

296
00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.710
The year end jury might be an insurance emphasis.

297
00:15:42.711 --> 00:15:44.540
So what it allows us to do is just give,

298
00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:48.560
give kind of Kudos and credence to the athlete to understand where's the best

299
00:15:48.561 --> 00:15:50.780
approach and where are you going to optimize your responses

300
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:55.290
<v 4>in every other sport.
It's easier to train for them.
MMA who think about it.</v>

301
00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.970
I was a defensive end in high school.

302
00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:00.830
Every defensive end needs the same physical abilities.
You think about the uh,

303
00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:03.030
combine the NFL combine for instance.

304
00:16:03.031 --> 00:16:06.030
They've figured out over a million years what they want to test for.

305
00:16:06.270 --> 00:16:10.890
And like the,
the guys that,
that,
you know,
they,
they run the same,
the jump,

306
00:16:10.891 --> 00:16:12.630
the same per position,
right?

307
00:16:12.631 --> 00:16:15.630
So quarterbacks donated to necessarily be that fast if they can throw it right.

308
00:16:15.631 --> 00:16:19.290
But for everybody else,
the numbers are kind of the same for our sport.

309
00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:23.100
And they've collected,
I dunno,
I dunno how many data points at this point.

310
00:16:23.370 --> 00:16:27.870
It's a lot.
So they're anonymized,
normalize.
So you know what average looks like,

311
00:16:27.871 --> 00:16:31.620
what you know,
so you can give a guy like Anthony Smith say,
hey look man,

312
00:16:31.650 --> 00:16:36.480
if I bring him up,
because he's mentioned it before,
he's been outspoken about,

313
00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.460
you know,
working with the Pii,
hey,
you know what,

314
00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:42.000
you're forced power measurements.
They're pretty average for two oh five.

315
00:16:42.030 --> 00:16:44.820
You're not,
you're not a weak guy.
You don't,

316
00:16:44.850 --> 00:16:46.890
you could think about going up a weight class.

317
00:16:46.891 --> 00:16:49.620
So it's just objective information.

318
00:16:49.621 --> 00:16:53.160
So the athletes and hopefully their coaches can make those choices.

319
00:16:54.270 --> 00:16:57.390
Do you think they would benefit from more weight classes?
Oh,

320
00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:02.360
that's a great question.
I,
so I thought ha 65 you know,

321
00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:04.680
look at the percentages and then you know,

322
00:17:04.681 --> 00:17:07.350
I was talking to actually Dana and Sean and there was like,

323
00:17:07.351 --> 00:17:10.320
well this guy's going to go to 65 this guy's going to go to six to five.

324
00:17:10.321 --> 00:17:13.800
Everybody's kind of go.
So is it going to help?
I mean,

325
00:17:13.801 --> 00:17:16.710
there needs to be a percentage difference,
but I don't know.

326
00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:20.670
I think people would just say,
well shit,
now I have to do an extra five pounds.

327
00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:24.090
But again,
so from a PCI standpoint,

328
00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.150
that's not really a decision we have to make.

329
00:17:27.151 --> 00:17:30.900
What we need to do is collect as much data as we can on that and for individual

330
00:17:30.901 --> 00:17:31.920
fighters trying to figure out which,

331
00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:36.420
and then also to provide that information to,
you know,
third party commissions.

332
00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:37.890
It's just so many,
there's the gaps.

333
00:17:37.891 --> 00:17:41.160
You know how these days it's okay and I know what you're doing.

334
00:17:42.590 --> 00:17:46.620
Well you can from 85 to two oh five,
that's 20 pounds.
That is an enormous jump.

335
00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:49.980
So how do you decide like when a is a tweener,
like how do you

336
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:54.330
<v 2>look at a guy who maybe ways to 15 and go,
damn dude,
those are the numbers.</v>

337
00:17:54.390 --> 00:17:56.190
Like what's your path?
What's your speed?

338
00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:59.730
Are you a good athlete for that weight class?
All right,
not,
yeah.

339
00:17:59.830 --> 00:18:03.030
What's your online?
How does that,
you know,
how does your arm like,

340
00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:06.890
and the way you fight,
right?
So if you're Tyson ski,

341
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:10.050
you can have short arms and you Russell got like a gray Maynard style,
right?

342
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.720
That's fine.
You don't need super long arms.
But you know,

343
00:18:12.721 --> 00:18:15.660
if you're not a wrestler you don't have the head move.
Maybe you do anyway.

344
00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:19.590
We've actually had a number of athletes I would say over the last year come to

345
00:18:19.591 --> 00:18:22.740
us specifically.
And sometimes it's matchmakers who were saying,
Hey,

346
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:27.330
this guy wants to go down.
Come,
come,
take a look,
meet with the Pi Staff,
see what,

347
00:18:27.331 --> 00:18:29.410
see what you guys think.
Um,

348
00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:31.950
all of those things that Forrest said are really valid.

349
00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:34.470
We do have a lot of a battery of tests,

350
00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:38.250
both in the nutrition space around body composition,
around metabolic

351
00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:40.650
function.
Uh,

352
00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:45.390
oftentimes bad weight cuts will diminish and depressed the metabolic rate,

353
00:18:45.391 --> 00:18:49.290
the resting metabolic rate as well as,
as it progresses over time through,

354
00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:52.950
through training.
Um,
and then like we said,
some of the energy systems,

355
00:18:52.951 --> 00:18:57.040
a lot of the strength and power diagnostics.
How does an athlete compare to the,

356
00:18:57.041 --> 00:19:01.440
the,
the norms and the standards that are set for that division?
So first things,

357
00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:05.580
first thing that I look at is how does,
how does their body fit into a division?

358
00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:08.220
Uh,
everybody's body is broken into three components.

359
00:19:08.221 --> 00:19:12.780
If you think about it in terms of bone,
muscle and fat.
And if somebody's fat,

360
00:19:12.781 --> 00:19:15.120
free mass,
it's everything except for their,
uh,

361
00:19:15.121 --> 00:19:20.121
their fat is 90 is bigger than 99% of the athletes in that way.

362
00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:24.900
Division,
it's not going to be a good fit.
So a big thing is benchmarking,

363
00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:28.380
understanding how somebody body fits into their division compared to others.

364
00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:30.510
So that's Kinda step one.

365
00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:33.330
Then we look through all of these other different metrics to see how they

366
00:19:33.331 --> 00:19:37.140
compare.
And then we have a conversation.
So my job has never,

367
00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:40.800
especially working with independent contractors,
they can use us or they can,

368
00:19:40.801 --> 00:19:41.634
they can not.

369
00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:45.800
And we are a resource to consult and to have conversations with them,
uh,

370
00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.690
about what makes sense on a scientific level.

371
00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:52.100
Can I ask you how that works is like I've saved someone like a Henry pseudo or

372
00:19:52.101 --> 00:19:55.680
some wants to do his camp.
Yep.
Uh,
at the UFC performance institute.

373
00:19:55.681 --> 00:19:57.510
How would they do schedule it with you guys?

374
00:19:57.770 --> 00:20:00.990
Tell you I'm going to be here for eight weeks.
We set up camp in Vegas,

375
00:20:00.991 --> 00:20:03.900
we'd like to do it at the,
at the gym.
So it happens all the time,

376
00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:07.890
whether it's a week or or eight weeks that that filters into every single member

377
00:20:07.891 --> 00:20:08.371
of our team,

378
00:20:08.371 --> 00:20:11.550
especially as we're doing more and more on the ground at fight events.

379
00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:15.360
But that gets filtered up to Dunkin and then Dunkin handles the coordination of

380
00:20:15.361 --> 00:20:19.950
that.
It could literally be there with safe.
He was gonna Fight Marlin Mariah's.

381
00:20:20.010 --> 00:20:23.100
They literally could be in the performance institute at the same time for shill

382
00:20:23.190 --> 00:20:26.400
and that that happens.
Split level facility.

383
00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:30.190
They're never in the same zone at the same time you scheduled it.

384
00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:34.290
I wouldn't be doing MMA in the octagon.
You schedule them first come first serve.

385
00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:39.090
Do you ever anticipate a problem like with guys that are supposed to be fighting

386
00:20:39.091 --> 00:20:42.480
each other?
You know like what just happened with Mazda doll recently?

387
00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:45.810
Like we're an actual fist fight breaks out man.

388
00:20:46.170 --> 00:20:48.160
You find most of these guys want to get paid

389
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.530
<v 0>to fight and not pay to fi.
Right.</v>

390
00:20:49.531 --> 00:20:53.800
But when you see like the camera's on and on then not so yeah.
That fight.
Yeah,

391
00:20:53.801 --> 00:20:55.480
that's true.
Right.
When the cameras aren't on.

392
00:20:55.530 --> 00:20:58.540
The other thing is when you're leading into a fight and my thought was you

393
00:20:58.541 --> 00:21:01.120
cannot let that person think they intimidated you.

394
00:21:01.150 --> 00:21:03.970
And if that means you actually have to hit them,
maybe it does.
But the,
the,

395
00:21:03.971 --> 00:21:04.211
you know,

396
00:21:04.211 --> 00:21:08.110
the idea is that I can't let you think that you have a mental advantage,
right.

397
00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:13.020
In any other sports.
So we know why I ever want to see that.
Like he was like,

398
00:21:13.060 --> 00:21:16.360
you gotta stop that.
But in fighting it's like,
oh,
they just do an extra fighting.

399
00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:21.370
Yeah,
right.
I was like,
you guys are getting paid.
Yeah.
Look,

400
00:21:21.371 --> 00:21:22.360
if it's a basketball player,

401
00:21:22.361 --> 00:21:24.460
sucker punches another basketball player in the face.

402
00:21:24.461 --> 00:21:28.420
It's some sort of a press conference like that,
like Mazda doll did.

403
00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:31.590
I mean you'd be like,
what?
No Way.
But in fighting like,
oh,

404
00:21:31.591 --> 00:21:32.590
these are did extra fighting.

405
00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.870
You don't get extra buddy or extra credit

406
00:21:41.050 --> 00:21:44.560
for that performance was going to get extra money.
Stunning.

407
00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:48.250
Knock out of Darren tills,
one of the top guys in the Welterweight Division,

408
00:21:48.251 --> 00:21:49.810
the weight k Odin was crazy.

409
00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:54.730
So he got it from that and then to tee off on Leon Edwards after the fight like

410
00:21:54.731 --> 00:21:56.990
that,
it's like another one like that.

411
00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:00.880
It's part of that is very good for him,
unfortunately.

412
00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.670
Like I don't want him to do that.
I don't,
I don't want encourage,

413
00:22:03.671 --> 00:22:07.300
but if you want to think about like a fighter's popularity

414
00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:12.880
he's in,
I don't give a fuck,
I'll punch you in the face guy.
And they're like,
wow.

415
00:22:12.881 --> 00:22:15.910
A lot of people are now.
He's a real,
and I don't give a fuck.

416
00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.130
I'll punch you in your face guy.
They're real.

417
00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:21.730
They're really exists and he's a world class fighter like that's a,

418
00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:23.450
that's sellable.
It's unfortunate.

419
00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:27.250
I wish guys wouldn't ever fight at press conferences like Cormier and Jon Jones.

420
00:22:27.251 --> 00:22:31.450
I fucking hated that.
But tell me that didn't sell more tickets.
No doubt.

421
00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:34.810
That's sold a shitload more tickets.

422
00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:38.390
How many times they throat show show and that Dolly,
oh,

423
00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:42.550
how many times they show that even in the promos.
I hated when that happened.

424
00:22:42.551 --> 00:22:46.630
There was a terrible thing to Conner did that got,
damn,
that sold some tickets.

425
00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:49.390
That's a,
that's a fine line,
right?
That's kind of a funny thing.

426
00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:54.100
People that weren't even involved got cut.
You got hit with glass.

427
00:22:54.550 --> 00:22:59.430
Get canceled on me that,
I mean using it promoted.
Yes,
yes.
Yeah.

428
00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:03.880
We just tried to avoid it and hide it or do we let people know that this is a

429
00:23:03.881 --> 00:23:07.630
real thing?
They call all,
all people involved.
Go,
look,
this is a business.

430
00:23:07.631 --> 00:23:09.580
We're here to get paid.
Okay,
we're going to run it.

431
00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:13.330
We're going to run it every 15 minutes.
I'm going to show that Dolly Smash.
Oh,

432
00:23:13.331 --> 00:23:18.220
and that's we'll Harris's company.
Is that the gentlemen?
What is it?

433
00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:21.610
What is it called?
Anatomy of a fighter.
Yes.

434
00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:25.630
That's his youtube show that I often thought was a UFC show.

435
00:23:25.631 --> 00:23:27.250
I didn't even know that he had his own show.

436
00:23:27.820 --> 00:23:30.970
There's so many good guys right now that are putting out good content.

437
00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:35.440
It's will Harris.
Yep.
And uh,
he came in here with Camaros.
Mine,

438
00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.740
Super Nice Guy.
But his,
uh,
his footage is his,

439
00:23:38.741 --> 00:23:42.130
that was his footage of that Dolly smashing it.
The window.

440
00:23:42.131 --> 00:23:44.230
So the thing you see over and over again,
thank will,

441
00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:46.310
I think the embedded guys from the UFC

442
00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:47.720
<v 5>were on the bus as well,
so they got</v>

443
00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:53.550
<v 4>congratulated on the outside.
Jesus Christ.
Anyway,
sorry about that.</v>

444
00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:58.770
Hey listen man,
this is how this show works.
It goes off the rails occasionally.

445
00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:01.420
Um,
it is,
uh,
what,

446
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:04.860
what you guys have set up though is kind of an impressive thing and the combat

447
00:24:04.861 --> 00:24:05.431
sports world,

448
00:24:05.431 --> 00:24:10.050
but he's never anything like this for boxing were boxers can go and it's closest

449
00:24:10.051 --> 00:24:13.340
to the Olympic model.
So we went around benchmarking and Yada Yada,

450
00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:14.730
60 plus facilities.

451
00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:19.970
And you notice like a lot of the people that we hired worked with International

452
00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:23.460
Olympic sports and that's kind of our athlete model,
right?
So Olympic athletes,

453
00:24:23.461 --> 00:24:28.461
they might go to Colorado Springs for two weeks or for four months or for a

454
00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:32.730
week,
um,
and do like a skills camp or something for we,
we have the same model.

455
00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:37.680
You come in three,
four days and then go home with like a program,
you know,

456
00:24:37.681 --> 00:24:42.300
with Daya,
shrike traditional program,
PT program,
your training load goals,

457
00:24:42.301 --> 00:24:45.870
et cetera.
So you'd leave with that,
right.
And then maybe,
you know,
you can't,

458
00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:48.630
you don't want to move your life to Vegas.
You got family kids back home.

459
00:24:48.631 --> 00:24:52.530
So you'd come out three days every other month and they can actually monitor and

460
00:24:52.531 --> 00:24:56.670
tell you this is how your training's going.
It's just again,

461
00:24:56.970 --> 00:24:58.350
just data on whether it,

462
00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:02.490
it's working or not working as opposed to my old boxing coach knocked today kit.

463
00:25:03.330 --> 00:25:07.910
But it's good.
I was like,
I eat cookies last night.

464
00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:12.790
Punch hard.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Um,

465
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:16.680
the scientific approach of getting those little extra percentage points of

466
00:25:16.681 --> 00:25:20.730
improvement is really what it's all about.
And it could really be the difference.

467
00:25:20.731 --> 00:25:25.731
And it's such a crazy sport because it's so wild and unpredictable and you mean

468
00:25:26.130 --> 00:25:29.700
you could speak to this better than anybody?
The results may vary,

469
00:25:29.890 --> 00:25:32.310
but it is a wild goddamn sport.

470
00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:36.600
I had one of the best camps I ever had was a Keith chardy the aggressor while I

471
00:25:36.601 --> 00:25:41.490
was fucking amazing in the gym.
Now I was like,
I am so good right now.

472
00:25:41.491 --> 00:25:44.550
I beat everybody up.
This is amazing.
But you know,

473
00:25:44.551 --> 00:25:47.710
it was a 14 week camp started falling apart then

474
00:25:49.080 --> 00:25:52.040
<v 5>with as many degrees of freedom is mixed martial arts.
All right.</v>

475
00:25:52.050 --> 00:25:56.760
In terms of execution,
well,
just syncing the stylistic backgrounds,
white classes,

476
00:25:57.240 --> 00:25:59.910
you don't even know when Dana is going to give you a call to the next fight.

477
00:25:59.911 --> 00:26:01.860
Let's,
let's look at Usain Bolt,
right?

478
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:05.160
There's a reason why you saying bolt is a hundred meter champion and he's not

479
00:26:05.161 --> 00:26:09.360
the 60 meter champion.
All right,
our guys,
if,
if you look at mixed martial arts,

480
00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:13.260
that is six to 36 seconds of high intensity work,

481
00:26:13.261 --> 00:26:17.100
followed by two to three times as much low intensity work repeated throughout

482
00:26:17.101 --> 00:26:17.970
our five minute round.

483
00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:23.250
77% of fights are won in those high intensity efforts,
right?

484
00:26:23.251 --> 00:26:24.900
So that's where the fight is won in lust,

485
00:26:25.170 --> 00:26:28.200
but you don't know if that six seconds is going to be the first six seconds of

486
00:26:28.201 --> 00:26:30.120
the fight or the last seconds of the fight.

487
00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:34.260
So Usain bolt knows that he's going a hundred a hundred meters.
All right?

488
00:26:34.290 --> 00:26:39.000
Our guys don't know if there needs to be the the best starter,
the best finisher.

489
00:26:39.001 --> 00:26:42.030
So you've got to prepare for everything.
So all,
all these degrees of freedom,

490
00:26:42.031 --> 00:26:44.100
these various external variable things

491
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:48.240
<v 3>that come into mixed martial arts make it the most complex bought to figure out</v>

492
00:26:48.241 --> 00:26:50.490
and build a structure and a development pathway.
Again,

493
00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:53.380
it's so interesting too that so many different fighters ever.

494
00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:57.030
Completely different approach.
Like you've gotten a low volume,

495
00:26:57.060 --> 00:26:58.020
high power approach,

496
00:26:58.021 --> 00:27:00.990
like maybe your Tyron Woodley and then you've got a guy like Nick Diaz who just

497
00:27:00.991 --> 00:27:01.824
smothers guys.

498
00:27:01.950 --> 00:27:05.370
He just stays on you and keeps punching you and talking shit to you and he sees

499
00:27:05.371 --> 00:27:07.890
you starting to lose your breath and it keeps coming after you.

500
00:27:07.891 --> 00:27:11.130
And he can push a pace because of his long term cardiovascular condition.

501
00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:12.511
I mean it's,
it's,

502
00:27:12.511 --> 00:27:15.970
and you can't tell him he's doing it wrong because not everybody's doing it as

503
00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:20.180
sometimes your physiology,
right.
It's going to determine the way you fight.
Right?

504
00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:25.230
Like the arm length,
the John Jones and the leg and arm length clarify like that.

505
00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:25.861
Cause I'm gonna get,

506
00:27:25.861 --> 00:27:28.950
I'm not going to be at the end of everybody's punched just that are rich.

507
00:27:28.951 --> 00:27:31.680
I'm going to be getting hit by everybody if I start throwing those tapes,

508
00:27:31.681 --> 00:27:36.210
you know?
And also it allows him in training to like get better.

509
00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:39.050
Like he's always got this.
So he's got this advantage.

510
00:27:39.051 --> 00:27:43.830
He's like constantly getting better and he's also the best I've ever seen at

511
00:27:43.831 --> 00:27:45.210
utilizing that reach.

512
00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:50.420
He's very good at keeping his opponent exactly where he needs him and in in his

513
00:27:50.761 --> 00:27:55.190
range and then when they close up,
he's very good at being defensive.
I mean it's,

514
00:27:55.191 --> 00:27:56.880
it's,
I mean that's what the best fighters do,
right?

515
00:27:56.890 --> 00:27:58.590
The tend to fight whether they want it to go,

516
00:27:58.710 --> 00:28:02.190
but it's just so interesting to see that everyone does have a different approach

517
00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:04.590
that they make work with their body structure.

518
00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:08.160
It's quite unique because we've looked at a lot of our physiological assessments

519
00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:12.120
and when you take the data and you compare and contrast,
for example,

520
00:28:12.150 --> 00:28:15.090
people with grappling and wrestling backgrounds versus striking backgrounds,

521
00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:19.770
you can take something like power and you can differentiate between those two.

522
00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:20.371
So,
all right,

523
00:28:20.371 --> 00:28:25.371
I want to get a competitive advantage as a striker and might need to improve my

524
00:28:25.381 --> 00:28:27.960
strength work because the wrestlers are already stronger than me.

525
00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:31.470
We can look at the,
the,
the,
the,
the strength characteristics and you know,

526
00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.450
our data shows that those comes with the,
the,

527
00:28:33.460 --> 00:28:36.840
the guys that come from a wrestling background are far and above stronger than

528
00:28:36.841 --> 00:28:38.430
the strikers,
which you would expect,
right?

529
00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:42.990
But if you look at things like can you differentiate our top 15 in the world

530
00:28:42.991 --> 00:28:45.960
versus the rest of the roster and that weight class,
it just,
it,

531
00:28:45.970 --> 00:28:50.070
it takes away any comparative,
um,
any comparison.

532
00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:54.270
And at the end of the day,
ultimately in a complex chaos based sport,

533
00:28:54.450 --> 00:28:57.960
skill is always going to be the best determinant of performance.

534
00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:01.770
So we're not saying that the physiological variables aren't important to the

535
00:29:01.771 --> 00:29:02.550
sport of MMA,

536
00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:06.480
but it's really hard to tease out where you need to push your strategy and where

537
00:29:06.481 --> 00:29:09.360
you need to optimize your training.
Because in a,
in a,

538
00:29:09.390 --> 00:29:11.910
in a homogeneous population of world class fighters,

539
00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:15.860
it kind of gets absorbed and it becomes invisible where the differences are

540
00:29:16.530 --> 00:29:17.370
important point.

541
00:29:17.371 --> 00:29:22.371
We usually are a little more specific per app or should they just told me what

542
00:29:22.561 --> 00:29:25.980
not to do.
What do I do though?
Well,
and that's where the individualization,

543
00:29:25.981 --> 00:29:28.050
personalization for every single athlete comes in.

544
00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.880
We find their strengths and some of their,

545
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:35.910
their gaps where it might be the lowest point scoring component of their

546
00:29:35.911 --> 00:29:36.990
decathlon of MMA.

547
00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:41.590
And if it's a deficiency that maybe hasn't been taken advantage of yet but will,

548
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:42.070
that's

549
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:45.970
<v 1>where we fill those gaps so that they can start to fill those holes and become</v>

550
00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:49.510
more complete,
more comprehensive.
That might be strength,
power.

551
00:29:49.690 --> 00:29:54.070
It might be energy system,
it may be,
it could be anything.
It could be orthopedic.

552
00:29:54.071 --> 00:29:55.750
I mean we,
we have,
we're,

553
00:29:55.770 --> 00:30:00.770
we're trying to assess every component of preparation that can support or limit

554
00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:06.340
that athlete's performance in the cage in terms of,
you know,
how they,

555
00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:09.220
all those things work together is really vital.

556
00:30:09.221 --> 00:30:11.110
That if somebody is working on their strength and power,

557
00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:12.130
they're not feeding their,

558
00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:16.600
their body in a way that's actually limiting their ability to perform in the

559
00:30:16.601 --> 00:30:17.980
high intensity training.
Right.

560
00:30:17.981 --> 00:30:22.780
Because then that limits the adaptation that we're looking for as a response to

561
00:30:22.781 --> 00:30:25.840
that training.
And that's,
that's a really critical point where nutrition,

562
00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:31.080
Phil's really is a foundation that supports the development of all the other

563
00:30:31.271 --> 00:30:32.340
adaptations that that,

564
00:30:32.341 --> 00:30:36.250
that are required to become that complete mixed martial artists.

565
00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:40.960
So as the strength and conditioning plan is being laid out as the physical

566
00:30:40.961 --> 00:30:45.100
therapy plan,
as the recovery plan,
all of those are are coming to fruition.

567
00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:49.510
The nutrition obviously is really near and dear to what I'm doing is really

568
00:30:49.511 --> 00:30:53.050
critical at supporting the adaptation so that we're not pulling the bus,

569
00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:55.000
you know,
the,
the athlete in two different directions.

570
00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:57.460
In terms of the adaptation now

571
00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:03.160
<v 3>in terms of when you take fighters and athletes into your performance institute,</v>

572
00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:09.350
have you guys ever worked with young junior,
like amateur mixed martial artists,

573
00:31:09.410 --> 00:31:13.700
kids that are coming up and do you ever do stuff like that and show them like

574
00:31:13.701 --> 00:31:17.480
give them a peek at what it's like to see like the world class fighters?

575
00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:21.050
We don't have the performance institute in Las Vegas because we're very much

576
00:31:21.051 --> 00:31:25.970
aligned to supporting our current roster and it's a facility and a philosophy

577
00:31:25.971 --> 00:31:28.160
that's been designed to support our current roster.

578
00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:30.560
What we're doing in June of this year,
however,

579
00:31:30.570 --> 00:31:32.810
is opening up a facility in Shanghai,

580
00:31:32.811 --> 00:31:36.770
China and which will have a completely different business model in terms of that

581
00:31:36.771 --> 00:31:40.460
will be very much a developmental program for guys that aren't in the currently

582
00:31:40.461 --> 00:31:45.220
in the even state.
So obviously we're trying to improve the talent standards in,

583
00:31:45.221 --> 00:31:48.170
in China and,
and develop that market and break that new territory.

584
00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:51.080
But the mechanism to do in that is going to be very much to talent development

585
00:31:51.081 --> 00:31:54.260
in the performance institute.
So over there we will have um,

586
00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:57.200
MMA coaches and grappling coachees and striking coaches.

587
00:31:57.201 --> 00:31:59.780
We don't have that in Las Vegas because we're currently working with guys that

588
00:31:59.781 --> 00:32:00.920
are already on the roster.
Well,

589
00:32:00.921 --> 00:32:05.000
it's such a unique sport in the fact that even though it is one thing when you

590
00:32:05.001 --> 00:32:06.230
get into the UFC,

591
00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:11.350
the paths to get there are so widely different and you really don't know what

592
00:32:11.421 --> 00:32:15.210
the right wing is the cro cop path the right way to do it or is it Daniel

593
00:32:15.210 --> 00:32:16.310
Cormier a path,
the right way to do it?

594
00:32:16.370 --> 00:32:19.760
No one can say and different fighters will win on different nights with

595
00:32:19.761 --> 00:32:24.410
different styles.
It's d one of the only sports where your pathway in.

596
00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:28.610
You could say that if someone isn't elite kickboxer or an elite grappler that

597
00:32:28.611 --> 00:32:33.110
going in with that one major advantage in that one skillset could,

598
00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:34.970
could take you very,

599
00:32:34.971 --> 00:32:38.960
very far versus an overall game approach that some guys have.

600
00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:40.130
They're really good at everything.

601
00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:43.680
<v 5>Right.
And the true specialist,
if you look at the day,
the true specialist,</v>

602
00:32:43.681 --> 00:32:48.000
the GSPS of this world still hasn't necessarily risen to the top in the sport of

603
00:32:48.001 --> 00:32:50.820
MMA.
You still see guys that are stylistically,

604
00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:53.940
they have a stylistic emphasis and that's the x factor that keeps them at the

605
00:32:53.941 --> 00:32:54.630
top of the game.

606
00:32:54.630 --> 00:32:56.580
<v 2>Yeah.
And,
and then there's execution,</v>

607
00:32:56.610 --> 00:33:00.690
which is creativity and their ability to perform under pressure or their ability

608
00:33:00.691 --> 00:33:05.400
to maintain their cool during camp where they never overtrained and they stay in

609
00:33:05.401 --> 00:33:07.310
a good space,
stay in a good headspace.

610
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:10.230
And I've girlfriend problems or boyfriend problems.

611
00:33:10.410 --> 00:33:13.980
And then they get to the final night of the competition with the most in the

612
00:33:13.981 --> 00:33:16.860
tank.
And that's a,
that's an art in and of itself,
right?

613
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:21.480
So when you first asked about,
you know,
something,
I've seen that I love,
uh,

614
00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:25.920
training partners,
right?
So bring your training partners to the UFC,
Pii.

615
00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:28.410
And we've had,
I dunno,
six,
seven,

616
00:33:28.411 --> 00:33:32.550
eight guys that came in as training partners and are now on the UFC roster.

617
00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:35.760
So that's,
that's why I'm not an asshole to anyone.
That's cause you never know.

618
00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:40.200
I so you get to chance to see these,
I mean every guy has to start somewhere.

619
00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.310
Every girl has to start somewhere.

620
00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:44.820
You get a chance to see these people that may maybe never get this invitation

621
00:33:44.821 --> 00:33:47.480
there and they see the holy ground like God damn,

622
00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:50.880
I think it's performance as well.
To your point too about the facility,

623
00:33:50.881 --> 00:33:52.230
world class facility,

624
00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:56.070
the services we would argue are even better than the facility.

625
00:33:56.700 --> 00:34:00.420
But training partners,
coaches,
those that are on the contender series,

626
00:34:00.421 --> 00:34:02.370
those that came through for the ultimate fighter,

627
00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:06.810
they have all been able to use and to access the facility in short periods,

628
00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:12.000
training partners can come and access the facility,
eat on campus,
uh,
strength,

629
00:34:12.001 --> 00:34:15.290
train with the UFC athlete,
use the facility upstairs and,

630
00:34:15.291 --> 00:34:16.740
and train in the MMA space.

631
00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:19.500
And when they get the chance that when they get the shot,

632
00:34:19.501 --> 00:34:23.310
then they tap right into services and,
and,
and it,
it's an opportunity for us to,

633
00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:24.150
you know,

634
00:34:24.150 --> 00:34:27.480
essentially influenced the community even before we're working with them

635
00:34:27.481 --> 00:34:30.570
directly,
which is,
which is a really huge component of our,

636
00:34:30.571 --> 00:34:32.730
our philosophy and really what we're looking to accomplish.

637
00:34:33.230 --> 00:34:35.760
I think it would be massively inspirational for the fighters too.

638
00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:36.930
<v 5>Yeah.
I mean,</v>

639
00:34:36.930 --> 00:34:40.590
our philosophy is to accelerate the evolution of the sport of mixed martial
arts.

640
00:34:40.620 --> 00:34:43.130
That that's in our mission statement saying when you,

641
00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:46.510
when you walked through the door,
it's right there on the wall,
you know?
And,

642
00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:48.120
and to do that too,

643
00:34:48.180 --> 00:34:51.540
we're trying to shift the barometer in terms of not the professionalism of the

644
00:34:51.541 --> 00:34:54.180
sport,
but the expectations of fighters within the spot.

645
00:34:54.540 --> 00:34:57.080
You look at someone like Brown a tagger and listened.
What,

646
00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:00.030
what we're not trying to do is take the wild out of the stallion,
right?

647
00:35:00.570 --> 00:35:03.750
We're not trying to just push science at fights is at the end of the day,

648
00:35:03.751 --> 00:35:06.180
these guys have a world class fighters for a reason.

649
00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:09.510
But you can train and shape the stallion and it still has the wild at heart,

650
00:35:09.511 --> 00:35:12.390
right?
So what we're trying to do is shift the barometer.

651
00:35:12.391 --> 00:35:15.120
So there's an expectation of what a professional athlete should,

652
00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:18.360
should really expect.
Brian a tagger is worked out in his garage,

653
00:35:18.361 --> 00:35:22.690
most of his crit garage.
Sorry.
Um,

654
00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:23.910
but in terms of,
you know,

655
00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:27.540
what's the expectation that professional fights it should expect and the

656
00:35:27.550 --> 00:35:29.550
performance institute demonstrates that,
you know,

657
00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:33.080
not everyone can have access to it,
obviously,
but that's an aspiration and it's,

658
00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:35.850
it's where people should understand in the sport of mixed martial arts,

659
00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:38.010
the standard as a fighter you can

660
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:41.010
<v 3>expect.
And it's uh,
it's so important.</v>

661
00:35:41.011 --> 00:35:44.670
I think that you put all these things under one roof like that and create this

662
00:35:44.671 --> 00:35:48.850
environment because it,
it seems to be trickling off into other places.
Like the,

663
00:35:48.900 --> 00:35:52.680
the level of training and recovery and everything is so intense.

664
00:35:52.681 --> 00:35:56.040
It's so severe that people are starting to try to mimic certain aspects of that

665
00:35:56.041 --> 00:35:58.140
in their,
their own gyms and their own different places.

666
00:35:58.470 --> 00:36:03.030
The problem is you can't do things in isolation.
All right?
If you just say,
right,

667
00:36:03.031 --> 00:36:05.970
I'm going to really hammer the recovery piece and forget about the nutrition

668
00:36:05.971 --> 00:36:08.370
piece.
It's,
it's a large machine,
right?

669
00:36:08.371 --> 00:36:11.310
That there's cogs and all the cogs need to work together.

670
00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:16.110
And that's what we truly feel we can offer and we can deliver is this into not

671
00:36:16.111 --> 00:36:17.940
necessarily a multidisciplinary service,

672
00:36:17.941 --> 00:36:21.960
but an entire disciplinary service where we have multiple aspects coming

673
00:36:21.961 --> 00:36:26.210
together to fill the whole picture of an athlete's portfolio of needs.
And,

674
00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:29.700
and that's what we can offer through the performance institute we want to do is

675
00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:33.150
figure out what the best practices are and disseminate them.
Like,

676
00:36:33.151 --> 00:36:35.910
we don't want to just know a bunch of stuff so we can keep it.
Remember,

677
00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:39.060
we want every other gym like,
Hey,
here's what we've learned.

678
00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:44.220
This is how we do our recovery.
Take a tag of it,
try it.
See if you're covering,

679
00:36:44.310 --> 00:36:46.680
see if you want to laser bed.
Maybe you do,
maybe you don't.

680
00:36:46.740 --> 00:36:49.980
This is what we've found success in.
You know,
so you want to,
you know,

681
00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:53.120
what's the point of learning something and then hiding their way please.

682
00:36:53.850 --> 00:36:57.450
And everything's about assessment.
So it's not one recovery modalities,

683
00:36:57.451 --> 00:37:00.990
not one nutrition modality is not one strength and conditioning.
It's assessing.

684
00:37:00.991 --> 00:37:03.060
So then we could build that personalized approach.

685
00:37:03.300 --> 00:37:04.830
And so here are the modalities.

686
00:37:04.831 --> 00:37:09.831
Here's the philosophy that we've developed to help optimize athletes needs

687
00:37:10.051 --> 00:37:14.820
around what,
what,
what,
what we're measuring and we're not winning fights.

688
00:37:15.130 --> 00:37:16.230
That that's obvious.

689
00:37:16.231 --> 00:37:19.290
That comes with the x factors that comes from the fighters there,

690
00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:21.840
their passion and their commitment to their sport.

691
00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:24.300
But what we're trying to do back back to your original question,

692
00:37:24.301 --> 00:37:27.180
I think around this 1% is so hard to measure,

693
00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:31.170
but what we're able to do is to help them to do it more consistently and to do

694
00:37:31.171 --> 00:37:35.100
it longer into their career so that they can,
they can optimize,

695
00:37:35.101 --> 00:37:39.030
they can maximize their ability to train,
to adapt,

696
00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:42.960
to perform and give themselves the best chance to be successful on fight night.

697
00:37:43.210 --> 00:37:46.140
Jan,
there must be so many fighters that come from a discipline,

698
00:37:46.141 --> 00:37:48.090
whether it's judo or something along those lines,

699
00:37:48.091 --> 00:37:49.380
and then they start fighting and MMA,

700
00:37:49.381 --> 00:37:52.920
so they get a boxing coach and they have a few guys working with them with leg

701
00:37:52.921 --> 00:37:55.850
kicks,
but they don't have a nutrition guy and they don't have a recovery guide.

702
00:37:55.850 --> 00:37:58.290
I don't have someone who understands like deep tissue massage.

703
00:37:58.291 --> 00:38:01.590
They had to find that guy,
they got to find someone to organize a diet for them.

704
00:38:01.591 --> 00:38:05.580
They've got to figure out how to cut weight,
healthy,
proper.
And there's,

705
00:38:05.581 --> 00:38:07.650
these things are so difficult for fighters to put,

706
00:38:07.651 --> 00:38:11.520
especially you don't live in a place that has something like American top team

707
00:38:11.521 --> 00:38:15.420
or some gigantic institution.
Yeah.
I mean that,
that,

708
00:38:15.450 --> 00:38:19.500
that's fights is a even top fighters on our roster of bank potentially hire a

709
00:38:19.501 --> 00:38:22.020
nutritionist for a short period of time in if fight can,
you know,

710
00:38:22.021 --> 00:38:26.340
for an eight week period this,
this should be a 52 week fight camp.

711
00:38:26.370 --> 00:38:29.490
We should become central in our development as fight isn't as athletes,

712
00:38:29.491 --> 00:38:33.150
professional athletes,
50 to 52 weeks of the Aa and now,

713
00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:36.200
and I think that's too,
that's,

714
00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:40.050
that's what our philosophy is as Clint has already talked about.
Um,

715
00:38:40.230 --> 00:38:44.110
in terms of plugging the holes and being able to offer the services that you

716
00:38:44.111 --> 00:38:47.260
need as a particular athletes.
So there's,
there's large gyms out there,

717
00:38:47.261 --> 00:38:50.890
American top team,
Aka,
they've got their own guys.
That's,
that's great.
Jackson,

718
00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:53.110
they've got their own people.
Um,
but you know,

719
00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:57.010
w w there's plenty of people on the roster that have an MMA coach and a

720
00:38:57.011 --> 00:39:00.280
grappling coach.
And that's it.
So the performance institute,
we,

721
00:39:00.340 --> 00:39:03.090
we feel we can help them support those guys as well.
Right.

722
00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:07.330
And we're not trying to displace the programs were athletes already have

723
00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:12.360
resources but I don't know of another MMA gym globally that has the capacity

724
00:39:13.391 --> 00:39:15.790
around assessment that we do.
So yeah,
we have,

725
00:39:15.791 --> 00:39:19.300
we have some really great practitioners but both San of our strength coach and

726
00:39:19.301 --> 00:39:24.070
his team cannot write programs for 570 athletes.
It's not possible.

727
00:39:24.071 --> 00:39:26.830
But what we can do is assess those athletes,

728
00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:30.370
provide that feedback back to their strength coaches and have conversations

729
00:39:30.550 --> 00:39:33.190
about how those coaches can use that data to,

730
00:39:33.191 --> 00:39:36.280
to support the development of that athlete and that that goes across the board

731
00:39:36.281 --> 00:39:37.780
for all of our performance services.

732
00:39:37.810 --> 00:39:41.860
What's pretty amazing resource because if you're a young fighter and all you

733
00:39:41.861 --> 00:39:46.300
have is access to the people around you,
you get,
if you're fighting in the UFC,

734
00:39:46.330 --> 00:39:49.930
you get to have access like instantaneously to this gigantic group of people

735
00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:52.120
where it's like when forest,
when you were coming up,

736
00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:54.730
you mean you were a real pioneer.
I mean that was,

737
00:39:54.760 --> 00:39:57.540
that was not available to a guy.
Like,
you know,
I mean,

738
00:39:57.870 --> 00:39:59.460
<v 4>I tell the story all the time,
but,</v>

739
00:39:59.461 --> 00:40:02.230
so I was actually a little bit ahead of my time.
I had,
you know,

740
00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:05.730
I had an actual strength coach that had letters behind his name,

741
00:40:05.830 --> 00:40:10.020
went to college to be a strength coach,
not there was like an x body builder.
Uh,

742
00:40:10.021 --> 00:40:11.070
I had,
uh,
you know,

743
00:40:11.071 --> 00:40:15.600
a relatively good nutritionist who at least had a degree in chemical biology.

744
00:40:15.930 --> 00:40:20.190
Uh,
I had a good physical therapist,
but I didn't really have,
like,

745
00:40:20.191 --> 00:40:23.310
I was my coach at the end of the day,
I was the head of performance.

746
00:40:23.311 --> 00:40:24.900
So I'd go do Jujitsu,

747
00:40:25.560 --> 00:40:28.040
Jujitsu coach wants you to go hard and then he'd go kickbox,

748
00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:30.630
but you're going to go light,
but it's kicked by us or you don't.
And then,

749
00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:32.460
you know,
and now,
you know,

750
00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:36.180
nobody's the strength coach and nutritionist on different pages.

751
00:40:36.181 --> 00:40:40.440
So I think just understanding that everything has to work together,

752
00:40:40.530 --> 00:40:42.230
which I didn't really understand.

753
00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:42.661
<v 3>Well,</v>

754
00:40:42.661 --> 00:40:47.661
the one I'm saying is that you kind of had to pave a path because when a guy

755
00:40:48.061 --> 00:40:51.210
like you was doing all that stuff with a real legitimate strength and condition

756
00:40:51.211 --> 00:40:52.710
coach,
real legitimate nutritionist,

757
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:56.310
how many other people were doing that at your time?
Not that many,
but

758
00:40:57.080 --> 00:40:59.650
<v 4>beer on good people like Randy couture,
chocolate belt.</v>

759
00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:02.450
Those were kind of guys I got to hang out with and say,
well,
he does this.

760
00:41:02.451 --> 00:41:05.120
He does a chuck actually what ended that much of this stuff.

761
00:41:05.121 --> 00:41:08.600
But Randy was was right.
I know what I'm doing.
Okay.

762
00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:13.060
<v 3>All right.
Yes sir.
Yeah,
he just existed on pure savagery.
Um,</v>

763
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:16.350
when you step back and look at your career,
like how,

764
00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:21.520
how amazing is it to be able to step off from there and do something like you're

765
00:41:22.311 --> 00:41:26.120
doing now for the UFC performance institute was just very meaningful for young

766
00:41:26.121 --> 00:41:26.541
fighters.

767
00:41:26.541 --> 00:41:30.320
When you really do get a chance to give back with your experience and your

768
00:41:30.321 --> 00:41:33.740
understanding of the right way and the wrong way,
the mistakes you've made.

769
00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:34.070
I mean,

770
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:34.903
<v 0>it's huge.</v>

771
00:41:34.970 --> 00:41:38.240
<v 4>I mean that's the whole,
I mean that's the whole genesis cannot from,</v>

772
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:42.200
from my involvement in the pie like,
oh look,
here's the 10,000 mistakes I made.

773
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:44.520
You're going to make mistakes too.
But he,

774
00:41:44.670 --> 00:41:48.770
these are the ones you don't need to make.
You know,
again,
the sports change man,

775
00:41:48.771 --> 00:41:53.330
it's 25 years old.
Every other sports so evolved,
been around so long.

776
00:41:53.331 --> 00:41:57.170
Our sport changes all the time.
I forget who was talking about it,
but you know,

777
00:41:57.171 --> 00:42:00.500
even the guys fighting 10 years ago probably couldn't compete with guests

778
00:42:00.501 --> 00:42:02.000
fighting today,
you know.

779
00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:06.500
But I mean what I would say as well and is not only for the fighters forest is a

780
00:42:06.501 --> 00:42:07.480
huge results for us.

781
00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:10.520
The best of the best piece of technology we have is that they'll handle it leads

782
00:42:10.521 --> 00:42:12.590
from my office to forest office,
right?

783
00:42:12.591 --> 00:42:16.790
Because ultimately he's a massive results for us that are not necessarily coming

784
00:42:16.791 --> 00:42:21.590
from an NMA background and are trying to support the MMA community to,

785
00:42:21.850 --> 00:42:25.490
to bounce ideas off to essentially Beta test things from a thought process

786
00:42:25.491 --> 00:42:26.090
perspective.

787
00:42:26.090 --> 00:42:30.650
And he's a huge part of the performance institute philosophy because we can use

788
00:42:30.651 --> 00:42:33.140
and call upon his expertise.
Here's another funny thing.

789
00:42:33.141 --> 00:42:36.740
When we were putting together the,
the uh,
the team for the Pi,

790
00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:42.050
I kind of shied away from people already doing MMA.
I want to combat sports.

791
00:42:42.051 --> 00:42:45.950
Everybody that's done it has done judo boxing on an Olympic level.

792
00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:47.300
They've done combat sports.

793
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:51.440
But I wanted like a fresh set of eyes coming from a different,
you know,

794
00:42:51.441 --> 00:42:55.820
than just ah,
you know,
cause I know really good MMA strength coaches.

795
00:42:56.150 --> 00:43:00.650
I know pretty good.
Emma,
you know,
you,
you,
you know,
good but get,

796
00:43:00.651 --> 00:43:02.060
get that fresh set of eyes.
You know,

797
00:43:02.061 --> 00:43:06.290
nutrition actually was a little different because the rest of the world does not

798
00:43:06.291 --> 00:43:10.310
understand awake cut for an MMA fight.
It's not like a,
you know,

799
00:43:10.311 --> 00:43:13.580
we go to exos who go to any high level facility and that you said I'm going to

800
00:43:13.581 --> 00:43:16.490
lose 8% of my body weight and then competed on Saturday.
They were like,
no,

801
00:43:16.491 --> 00:43:19.310
don't just fight in the highway class.
And I'm like,
yeah,

802
00:43:19.311 --> 00:43:20.930
that actually isn't going to work out for me.

803
00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:25.590
<v 0>They just won't comprehend it though.
Like,
no,
no.
You'll perform better.
Like,
Nah.</v>

804
00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:28.300
So we'll know we have some money.
It's,

805
00:43:28.610 --> 00:43:32.060
that's another thing about having limited amount of weight classes when you jump

806
00:43:32.061 --> 00:43:34.460
up.
Chance crazy man.

807
00:43:34.550 --> 00:43:39.440
He's like one 74 [inaudible] 75 on fight day.
Yeah.
Fighting guys one 90 yeah,

808
00:43:39.441 --> 00:43:42.560
but with a lot of energy Z.
Yeah.
What's interesting is at his age,

809
00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:44.510
I think it's probably the only meals.
Yeah.

810
00:43:44.511 --> 00:43:47.840
I think it's probably a good move though at his age.
You know,

811
00:43:47.841 --> 00:43:52.040
I think he's back from UFC.
Ultimate fighter was inside.

812
00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:55.400
We knew though,
like on the show that he was the one they would go forever.

813
00:43:56.210 --> 00:44:00.920
We'd be with a house that I know.
A just crazy awesome.
Still gotta stop.

814
00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:03.890
I mean when w when he beat Micky Gall that way,
I was,

815
00:44:03.950 --> 00:44:07.170
I was incredibly impressed when I like this kid might test them.

816
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:08.930
He didn't test him at all.
I mean it was amazing.

817
00:44:09.180 --> 00:44:13.460
It's a prime Diego Sanchez performance 15 years into the game.

818
00:44:13.490 --> 00:44:17.000
I mean it doesn't even,
not even just into,
that's just into the UFC.

819
00:44:17.330 --> 00:44:20.870
He had amateur fights and our professional fights rather before the UFC,

820
00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:26.480
he spent in the UFC for 15 years or at least 14.
Right?

821
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:31.290
2004.
2005 was season one.
We shot it 2004.

822
00:44:31.291 --> 00:44:32.130
2005

823
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:32.963
<v 4>so yeah.</v>

824
00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.780
<v 0>Yeah.
Somewhere,
somewhere in the neighborhood of 15 years.</v>

825
00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:38.720
Just amazing that he's so enthusiastic about it.
It's still,
yeah,

826
00:44:38.721 --> 00:44:41.180
they'll give him a vase for his top of his mantle piece on it,

827
00:44:41.181 --> 00:44:42.030
but his fire or something,

828
00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:47.370
carriage clock or something just to recognize is 15 years.
Yeah.
That's um,

829
00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:51.470
that's a long time,
uh,
in a combat sport,
long time.

830
00:44:51.471 --> 00:44:56.180
So that's the other thing,
man,
that is not the norm.
That's a deviation.
Right.

831
00:44:56.620 --> 00:45:00.740
Either you got it for,
I made it nine years in the UFC,
eight years actually.

832
00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:04.700
And you know,
I didn't have that many fights.
I broke down,
I fell apart.

833
00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:07.460
It's pretty average,
you know,
I was like,
Whoa,
is me?

834
00:45:07.461 --> 00:45:11.660
And then when you look at the data,
it's like,
oh no,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm just average 35.

835
00:45:11.690 --> 00:45:13.190
That's,
that's when you start fall apart.

836
00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:17.480
When you look back now with what you know now and all the athletes you've worked

837
00:45:17.481 --> 00:45:20.390
with at the UFC pie,
do you think you would've done anything different?

838
00:45:20.910 --> 00:45:24.170
I pay even think about it.
I knew how to fake about it.
All right.
Yeah.

839
00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:29.440
<v 4>Yes sir.
Down
eight rounds.
Why would you party rounds?</v>

840
00:45:29.470 --> 00:45:33.770
There's no eight route fines for us.
Oh,

841
00:45:33.790 --> 00:45:37.260
you literally just getting slower.
Forced you already slow.
I don't know.

842
00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:42.190
<v 0>No,
it's uh,
again,
being a pioneer like you were,</v>

843
00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:46.750
there wasn't really a whole lot of guys before you that were operating had the

844
00:45:46.751 --> 00:45:49.990
other pioneers like the Randy's and the chunks and that's what they were doing.

845
00:45:50.110 --> 00:45:52.810
So better be tough about it or do what they do.

846
00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:56.290
That's the craziest thing about MMA is I'm not going to question them.

847
00:45:56.350 --> 00:45:57.760
Boxing it already figured out.

848
00:45:57.761 --> 00:45:59.710
You shouldn't beat the fuck out of each other every day.

849
00:45:59.740 --> 00:46:02.710
They had already kind of figured that.
The other thing they've figured out is,

850
00:46:03.530 --> 00:46:07.280
<v 4>uh,
we would work with peep,
would spar with Vandelay,
chuck,</v>

851
00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:10.190
Randy inboxing.
They don't spar with people.

852
00:46:10.191 --> 00:46:14.270
That equals past a certain point in camp.
We'll think about it.

853
00:46:14.271 --> 00:46:18.170
You know a lot about,
they start like is Floyd Mayweather sparring with,

854
00:46:18.171 --> 00:46:22.480
I don't know,
really good people his level?
No,
no,
definitely not.
He's,

855
00:46:22.481 --> 00:46:27.160
he's funny people.
Boxers and he's tool in them.
Yes,
yes.
Yeah.

856
00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:30.020
But they think,
have you heard of them though?
They're not famous and rich,

857
00:46:30.021 --> 00:46:32.480
so they're not the best in the world.
They're not elite.

858
00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:35.810
Whereas you think about like a gym,
like our gym.

859
00:46:35.811 --> 00:46:38.580
Like I'll just use Randy's cause I don't want to talk bad about anybody.

860
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:42.130
You're fighting other champions every day.
Right.
Maybe.

861
00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:46.420
Maybe dangerous as fuck.
Yeah.
Maybe drill together.
Sure.
Learn from each other.

862
00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:48.700
Role Wrestle,
like control your training,

863
00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:51.350
<v 0>especially guys that are in the same way.</v>

864
00:46:51.351 --> 00:46:54.570
Classes you that may some day fight you.
That's awkward.
Yeah.
Yeah.

865
00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:58.700
And there was no guidebook.
Yeah.
You know,

866
00:46:58.770 --> 00:47:02.160
you know guys like Keith Jardeen and Rashad Evans figured it out.
They're like,

867
00:47:02.161 --> 00:47:03.630
all right,
we already had to fight each other.

868
00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:06.320
We'll turn it together now we won't have to do it again.
Right.

869
00:47:07.130 --> 00:47:10.800
It's good move if it works out.
Um,
the,

870
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:15.000
the level of guys now is,
it's so extraordinary to see,

871
00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:17.040
like when you see the elite champions of today,

872
00:47:17.460 --> 00:47:21.220
you just have this insane level of,
of,
of fighter.
It's,

873
00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:24.060
it's really as a person who's been involved in the sport,
as long as I have,

874
00:47:24.450 --> 00:47:29.450
I still never cease to be amazed at the level of talent of these guys coming up.

875
00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:31.210
Because some of these guys coming up,

876
00:47:31.211 --> 00:47:33.530
they just could do everything and they can do everything.

877
00:47:33.530 --> 00:47:34.970
It's such a high level and you realizing you're,

878
00:47:34.971 --> 00:47:39.090
you're seeing the results of kids that started out learning MMA when they went

879
00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:42.430
five,
six years old men,
you know,
I had a purse,

880
00:47:42.431 --> 00:47:45.340
I have a personal gym and I remember Rhonda Rousey.
We like,
man,

881
00:47:45.341 --> 00:47:48.650
she's going to change my bottom line.
All of a sudden I got a mat full of,
uh,

882
00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:53.210
young women just trade fight.
I was like,

883
00:47:53.211 --> 00:47:57.520
this is,
thank you Rhonda.
Yeah,
chief for sure changed it.

884
00:47:57.550 --> 00:48:01.840
Gina Carano changes a little bit before her,
you know,
people had this idea like,

885
00:48:01.870 --> 00:48:04.600
oh,
you could be pretty and fuck people up.
Like,
oh,

886
00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:07.150
that's a totally different kind of girl.
That's like a superhero,

887
00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:11.110
like a real life superhero.
Now she plays it and movies.
Right?
Yeah.

888
00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:14.770
I mean it's just incredible too that the sport,
when you look at women's MMA,

889
00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:18.540
like,
like,
uh,
particularly Amanda Nunez,
Cris Cyborg,
that fight,
I mean,

890
00:48:18.550 --> 00:48:23.550
that is as crazy exciting as any fight you will ever see in your fucking life.

891
00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:27.850
And Amanda Nunez bombed on the one of the greatest,

892
00:48:27.851 --> 00:48:31.540
if not the greatest women's MMA fighter of all time and k odor in the first

893
00:48:31.541 --> 00:48:35.110
round in spectacular fashion.
Like if you're not a fan of MMA,

894
00:48:35.550 --> 00:48:39.130
women's MMA after watching that,
like,
it's funny you mentioned that.

895
00:48:39.131 --> 00:48:43.650
I just think about Holly Holm,
like what she made out of a million fights.

896
00:48:43.690 --> 00:48:48.200
Like what is she doing?
So,
right.
Like he's just,
she's a,
you know,

897
00:48:48.350 --> 00:48:52.630
GSP couture,
she just genetic specimen and I think she,
you know,

898
00:48:53.110 --> 00:48:57.220
she just,
again,
she does that 52 week fight camp type deal,
you know?
Right.
Yeah.

899
00:48:57.221 --> 00:49:01.490
You don't see her ever getting out of shapes and that's not how,
yeah.
You know,

900
00:49:01.510 --> 00:49:06.300
I still think she got a raw deal and the random he fight,
uh,
she did.
She did.

901
00:49:06.310 --> 00:49:09.910
She got clocks pretty,
pretty late.
Two Times hard to the buzzer.

902
00:49:09.940 --> 00:49:14.050
Absolutely two times and no,
no,
no points taken away.
No nothing.

903
00:49:14.051 --> 00:49:15.670
And we were shocked.
We were like that crazy.

904
00:49:15.671 --> 00:49:17.200
And then on top of that she dropped her,

905
00:49:17.201 --> 00:49:19.540
she dropped her with a head kick and she dropped her the straight left.

906
00:49:19.810 --> 00:49:23.500
Like in my opinion,
she did the more damage in that fight and I was,

907
00:49:23.530 --> 00:49:27.390
I was shocked.
But that's mean Emma made judge.
Yeah.

908
00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:29.090
It's never going to dad's crazy.

909
00:49:29.091 --> 00:49:33.310
He cannot help you with that at the performance institute.
But we got some data.

910
00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:36.690
What I was getting at before when you were talking about little kids when I was,

911
00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:40.030
I was rather talking about kids coming up and amateur fighters.

912
00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:46.040
There would probably something that would be really beneficial of having some

913
00:49:46.481 --> 00:49:50.740
sort of a program like that in America where kids could understand the right
way,

914
00:49:50.741 --> 00:49:54.730
the wrong way to do it,
so they don't have to repeat these problems and these,

915
00:49:54.731 --> 00:49:57.730
these mistakes that have already been kind of gone,
gone over.

916
00:49:58.710 --> 00:50:03.360
And that's your background and the British Olympic.
So set that up.
Right.

917
00:50:03.410 --> 00:50:04.243
You said that,

918
00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:08.560
would that be something that the UFC would ever think about doing in the future?

919
00:50:08.561 --> 00:50:12.220
Because if they really wanted to ensure that they had a good pool of high level

920
00:50:12.221 --> 00:50:14.070
talent,
it would certainly add to that.
Yeah.

921
00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:18.470
I mean there's no clear performance pathway into the w you know,

922
00:50:18.490 --> 00:50:21.470
the highest level of the UFC for the sport of mixed martial arts.
So,

923
00:50:21.490 --> 00:50:24.740
but there's guidelines for training that I think she might not have.

924
00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:27.980
Every gym has a curriculum and what we're to do is obviously

925
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:29.270
<v 5>add to that curriculum from us,</v>

926
00:50:29.530 --> 00:50:32.270
just from a training perspective or [inaudible] perspective.

927
00:50:32.271 --> 00:50:34.370
But ultimately what's,
what's the best pathway?

928
00:50:34.371 --> 00:50:35.720
And as you've already contested too,

929
00:50:36.020 --> 00:50:38.810
people are coming to this bolt with so many different backgrounds.

930
00:50:38.811 --> 00:50:43.400
So are you going to chop that the x access route to to the UFC in,

931
00:50:43.401 --> 00:50:46.850
in half for yesterday?
Uh,
going to promote it and find you know,

932
00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:49.110
many ways to get into the UFC.
I think,
you know,

933
00:50:49.270 --> 00:50:52.720
we can look at things like the Olympic Games.
It does MMA ever,

934
00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:55.130
ever entered into Olympic Games and create a pathway.

935
00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:59.480
Who knows and I'm sure the UFC are looking into that type of thing in the future

936
00:50:59.481 --> 00:51:02.900
and trying to be ambitious,
but right now it's hard to define what's the,

937
00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:06.620
what's the optimal way and what it,
what is the optimal route into the UFC.

938
00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:11.270
<v 2>It is a really,
that's one of the more interesting things about,</v>

939
00:51:11.271 --> 00:51:12.200
and like we were saying before,

940
00:51:12.230 --> 00:51:16.250
you could really have any combat sport path boxer wrestler,

941
00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:17.990
anything could get you in there.

942
00:51:18.410 --> 00:51:21.380
I'm sure it's the same for other disciplines of martial arts,

943
00:51:21.381 --> 00:51:24.740
but I have a lot of experience in kind of youth wrestling development.

944
00:51:25.160 --> 00:51:27.200
And when Emma May came along,

945
00:51:27.201 --> 00:51:30.490
it was a little bit of a fear we're going to lose a lot of athletes to MMA.

946
00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:34.460
And we did originally lose a lot of athletes on the Olympic level to MNA.

947
00:51:34.461 --> 00:51:38.660
Johny Hendricks is a great example.
Promising young wrestling star,
went to MMA,

948
00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:41.300
became UFC champ,
did not become an Olympian.
Um,

949
00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:45.080
but what it's really done is it's created this popularity in wrestling in no

950
00:51:45.081 --> 00:51:47.240
small part to I think some of the,
uh,

951
00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:50.720
the feedback that you've provided around wrestling been so vital to the

952
00:51:50.721 --> 00:51:54.470
development of,
of mixed martial arts.
But there's been a real boon,

953
00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:57.890
I believe in youth wrestling and in,
in,
you know,

954
00:51:57.891 --> 00:52:01.670
youth and high school wrestling because people realize and recognize that this

955
00:52:01.671 --> 00:52:04.640
is a pathway into,
uh,
you know,

956
00:52:05.090 --> 00:52:09.590
into becoming an elite mixed martial artists of all the athletes that are in the

957
00:52:09.591 --> 00:52:10.520
UFC.
You know,

958
00:52:10.521 --> 00:52:14.840
there's a very high level of champions right now that we're 2008 Olympians.
Um,

959
00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:18.080
but if you look at the roster and how many people wrestled in high school,

960
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:21.380
it's staggering.
And so just getting this base,
uh,

961
00:52:21.590 --> 00:52:25.390
not only technique in the grind mentality,
but the strength that you,
you know,

962
00:52:25.510 --> 00:52:27.860
double egging somebody from when you're five,
until you're 18,

963
00:52:27.861 --> 00:52:30.320
you develop strength that you can't develop when you're 22.

964
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:34.100
And this core strength and,
and the,
and the ability to do is,
is,

965
00:52:34.101 --> 00:52:35.450
is a way to get into it.

966
00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:39.260
And I know that other disciplines are likely receiving similar windfalls,

967
00:52:39.470 --> 00:52:42.650
but in terms of developing that curriculum for,
for development,
and that's,

968
00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:45.800
that's definitely part of the,
you know,
what we're interested in,

969
00:52:46.090 --> 00:52:50.060
in alleviating some of the,
the big,
the big mistakes,

970
00:52:50.061 --> 00:52:52.970
but there's still innumerable ways to get into it.

971
00:52:53.160 --> 00:52:54.680
Think about when you're doing Jujitsu,

972
00:52:55.550 --> 00:52:58.880
you had to like struggle to find people roll with when you started,
right?
Sure.

973
00:52:58.910 --> 00:53:03.020
It was like,
there's like six guys,
so you're worth now you can go anywhere.

974
00:53:03.021 --> 00:53:05.490
Like you can be doing a show in any,
uh,

975
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:10.060
just look up and go drop in on our local Jujitsu club.
That's panel jocks,

976
00:53:10.070 --> 00:53:12.080
noon class the other day.
I had 60 people in it.

977
00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:16.370
Six zero like what the fuck?
There was nowhere to move there.

978
00:53:16.371 --> 00:53:21.140
There's your talent development pathway to the UFC,
those kids classes,
right?

979
00:53:21.170 --> 00:53:26.100
Yup.
Yeah.
Um,
it's,
it really is interesting too and it's dependent upon if

980
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:29.410
<v 4>a kid lives in an area that has a strong Jujitsu program or a strong Moitai</v>

981
00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:33.510
program,
oftentimes that's what dictates what path they get into the sport from.

982
00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:36.420
No Dope.
Well good,
good women's wrestling program.

983
00:53:37.750 --> 00:53:38.980
<v 1>Yeah,
Russell,
like a girl,</v>

984
00:53:38.981 --> 00:53:43.810
I'm on the advisory board so I'm not only women's MMA but women's wrestling as

985
00:53:43.811 --> 00:53:47.230
well.
And there's,
what's really interesting working on the,

986
00:53:47.290 --> 00:53:49.030
on the kind of the clinical side of,

987
00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:52.510
of what we do with the Pi is every discipline has its own,

988
00:53:52.511 --> 00:53:56.500
not only sport culture,
but physiology that goes with it.
You know,

989
00:53:56.590 --> 00:53:59.200
as we talked about,
the strength dynamics for wrestlers

990
00:54:00.850 --> 00:54:03.610
are going to be different than the,
the,
the reactive strength for,

991
00:54:03.611 --> 00:54:05.720
for our strikers and then nutrition and,

992
00:54:05.721 --> 00:54:10.240
and just overall lifestyle type sport cultures is really interesting coming from

993
00:54:10.241 --> 00:54:13.870
the different disciplines that you came from.
Boxers,
they do the road work.

994
00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:16.780
They're doing a lot more fast and morning training,
uh,

995
00:54:16.781 --> 00:54:20.260
wrestlers that have obviously a weight cut culture that they bring with them and

996
00:54:20.261 --> 00:54:23.710
have a little bit more experienced there.
A lot of the Brazilian jujitsu players,

997
00:54:23.711 --> 00:54:26.110
especially from Brazil have their sport culture.

998
00:54:26.111 --> 00:54:29.030
So it's so intriguing being able to,
you know,

999
00:54:29.530 --> 00:54:34.150
we work with one sport but with so many subcultures within that sport and a

1000
00:54:34.210 --> 00:54:37.180
really,
really interesting to,
to to get to work with.

1001
00:54:37.181 --> 00:54:40.780
And obviously working with the female athletes like you alluded to earlier,

1002
00:54:41.050 --> 00:54:44.830
adds a whole nother layer in terms of the dynamics that we're working with.

1003
00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:46.300
In terms of the physiology with,

1004
00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:50.060
<v 4>I was just like the female physiology and the way cut.</v>

1005
00:54:50.061 --> 00:54:53.600
That's just the whole like you really need to go to school for that.
Yeah,

1006
00:54:53.601 --> 00:54:55.100
I would imagine that's a big difference.

1007
00:54:55.101 --> 00:54:59.140
Now you help them organize their weight cuts.
I know you work with Camaros,
man,

1008
00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:02.240
for his cut for his last fight.
Okay,
so with tomorrow

1009
00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:04.990
<v 1>we,
we,
we absolutely worked with them all the way through,</v>

1010
00:55:05.770 --> 00:55:08.950
all the way through the fight.
Did you guys know he had a broken foot?
Uh,

1011
00:55:08.980 --> 00:55:10.590
he was limping around but you know,

1012
00:55:10.760 --> 00:55:14.360
<v 4>no we didn't.
And if we did we wouldn't have mentioned it.
But no,
I had no idea.</v>

1013
00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:19.490
And and crazies,
that guy,
hey,
I did know he,
you know,
that's,
that's awesome.

1014
00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:21.050
I was actually happy.

1015
00:55:21.290 --> 00:55:25.010
Keeps in the building for the whole time and I didn't know that I was happy.

1016
00:55:25.011 --> 00:55:26.910
I was like,
yes,
good,
good job.

1017
00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:30.890
What happens in the walls stays in these walls because if there's this place

1018
00:55:30.891 --> 00:55:33.830
like the performance institute and it's run by the UFC.
Oh the,

1019
00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:36.620
the UFC that that pays me to fight people.

1020
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:39.110
I'm worried that that's going to get to them.
Right.

1021
00:55:39.111 --> 00:55:42.020
So of course the fingers go through when we started this,

1022
00:55:42.410 --> 00:55:43.850
like I don't want to know,

1023
00:55:43.851 --> 00:55:47.300
like I'm the liaison from them to the other side of the half.

1024
00:55:47.420 --> 00:55:49.160
I don't want to know whose weight is what.

1025
00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:53.330
I don't want to know who's got a nagging injury.
That's your,
you know,

1026
00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:55.790
some of that is actually Hipaa,
you know,
information.

1027
00:55:55.791 --> 00:55:58.970
That's your private stuff though.
Even if it's just how strong or weak you are.

1028
00:55:58.971 --> 00:56:01.250
If you're having a bad day,
I don't,

1029
00:56:01.550 --> 00:56:03.920
I don't want that to ever get out of our walls.
Right.

1030
00:56:03.921 --> 00:56:08.150
So that's obviously a conspiracy guy.
That's,
you know,

1031
00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:10.930
what does have to do with conspiracy.
Yeah.

1032
00:56:11.360 --> 00:56:15.950
Guys always think the UFC is out to get them to,
I always thought like,
ah,

1033
00:56:15.951 --> 00:56:20.150
they're going to find out that it got this or that and you know,
well,
you know,

1034
00:56:20.190 --> 00:56:24.100
there's,
turns out for me the stress of preparation,
a fight.
I mean

1035
00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:26.050
<v 1>people were always worried,
especially if there's a little tweak,</v>

1036
00:56:26.051 --> 00:56:29.650
something going on,
something with the hand,
something with the leg,
with the knee,

1037
00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:33.560
he will,
it gets out.
People find out about to hear about it.
Do I get it?
Yeah.

1038
00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:34.300
That's the thing.

1039
00:56:34.300 --> 00:56:38.830
It's a thing Comoro in every other athlete we work with comes in with sensitive

1040
00:56:38.831 --> 00:56:42.790
injuries and we have a private treatment suite within the performance institute,

1041
00:56:42.820 --> 00:56:47.560
the Pt area.
Um,
so they can come get private treatment.
And then in terms of,

1042
00:56:47.580 --> 00:56:51.430
you know,
supporting him for,
for his weight cut that,
that starts 10 weeks,

1043
00:56:51.431 --> 00:56:55.030
12 weeks for,
for tomorrow,
you know,
three,
four months in advance.

1044
00:56:55.031 --> 00:56:57.940
How much you're trying to get him down to before the day of the cut.

1045
00:56:58.210 --> 00:57:01.960
So every athlete is going to be a little bit different based on what their

1046
00:57:01.961 --> 00:57:03.210
background is,
what is,

1047
00:57:03.230 --> 00:57:07.960
what does comfortable cutting from what their historical we cutting,

1048
00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:12.220
uh,
practices have been the how hard they've been on the body.
So we're,

1049
00:57:12.221 --> 00:57:16.010
we're assessing somebody like tomorrow for their metabolic rate where,

1050
00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:19.090
where they fit in terms of their body composition into that weight division

1051
00:57:19.150 --> 00:57:21.430
would lean tissue versus their,
their fat tissue.

1052
00:57:21.670 --> 00:57:25.450
Those that have a higher degree of lean tissue,
we're going to have muscle,

1053
00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:27.670
has more water than,
than does fat and bone.

1054
00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:31.720
So you can't push the body a little bit further for those that have a higher

1055
00:57:31.721 --> 00:57:35.890
lean tissue.
Um,
and so all of that planning and preparation starts many,

1056
00:57:35.891 --> 00:57:36.970
many weeks in advance.

1057
00:57:37.330 --> 00:57:41.800
And having heard a commercial on your show a couple of weeks ago,
uh,
a lot of,

1058
00:57:41.830 --> 00:57:46.330
a lot of what we do with an athlete that doesn't have a history of missing

1059
00:57:46.331 --> 00:57:48.520
weight may have a hard time making weight,

1060
00:57:48.521 --> 00:57:51.970
but oftentimes they're making it harder on themselves because they're pulling

1061
00:57:51.971 --> 00:57:54.010
the body in two different directions.
Like we talked about.

1062
00:57:54.250 --> 00:57:56.740
If they're training in one way and feeding in a different way,

1063
00:57:56.980 --> 00:57:59.860
what they're doing is they're just undermining and kind of digging a digging a

1064
00:57:59.861 --> 00:58:02.140
hole that they can't get out of by the end of fight camp.

1065
00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:04.570
And that fight camp gets really long,
like forest talked about.

1066
00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:07.030
What do you see in terms of the way they fueled themselves?

1067
00:58:07.031 --> 00:58:10.060
It's like the biggest error sticking to one,

1068
00:58:10.450 --> 00:58:14.440
one style of feeding regardless of the training style that they're engaging in.

1069
00:58:14.441 --> 00:58:18.290
So MMA athletes,
they have to do high intensity training sessions,

1070
00:58:18.291 --> 00:58:19.180
strength and conditioning.

1071
00:58:19.181 --> 00:58:22.750
They have to be doing spa and they have to be doing pads rounds that are you

1072
00:58:22.751 --> 00:58:25.330
crazy hard,
um,
in,
in,
in every athlete.

1073
00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:28.450
Each one is going to have a different intensity relative to,
to,

1074
00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:31.060
to their body type.
And so if somebody is doing pads,

1075
00:58:31.061 --> 00:58:35.610
it's a nine or a 10 out of 10 in terms of intensity and they're doing that fast

1076
00:58:35.611 --> 00:58:39.250
it or they're doing that without carbohydrates available to do that work.

1077
00:58:39.430 --> 00:58:40.210
They can't,

1078
00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:44.170
they can't a hit those training intensities repeatedly and then they can't adapt

1079
00:58:44.440 --> 00:58:45.670
as a response to that training.

1080
00:58:45.670 --> 00:58:50.050
So they end up just getting slower and more beat up instead of faster and more

1081
00:58:50.051 --> 00:58:52.210
powerful.
So if they're doing high intensity,

1082
00:58:52.211 --> 00:58:56.290
we need to fuel the body in the specific way that supports that training effort.

1083
00:58:56.590 --> 00:59:00.790
And then the longer term adaptation to that bout.
Additionally,

1084
00:59:00.791 --> 00:59:01.930
if they're doing lower intensity,

1085
00:59:01.931 --> 00:59:06.790
we can adjust our fueling strategies based on what that dictates.
You know,

1086
00:59:06.791 --> 00:59:08.260
if it's,
if it's,
uh,
uh,

1087
00:59:08.590 --> 00:59:11.920
kind of a base of robotic training session or if they're doing skills and
drills,

1088
00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:15.460
we want to be feeding the body to adapt differently than if they're doing the

1089
00:59:15.461 --> 00:59:18.640
high intensity sparring,
strength and conditioning or pads,

1090
00:59:18.641 --> 00:59:22.100
what do whatever that might be.
So for every athlete,
we're looking

1091
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:25.730
<v 2>at how their body uses substrate energy,
the energy that they're using,</v>

1092
00:59:25.731 --> 00:59:28.790
the sub strait between carbs and fat at each of these intensities.

1093
00:59:29.030 --> 00:59:30.920
And then we also needed base it based,

1094
00:59:31.130 --> 00:59:35.450
we need to base our recommendations on where their body fits into the division.

1095
00:59:35.451 --> 00:59:39.890
If they're,
if they're 20% out from their weight division four weeks out,

1096
00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:43.130
then we're going to have a little bit of a more aggressive strategy

1097
00:59:43.131 --> 00:59:46.280
nutritionally because it weight becomes a primary factor.

1098
00:59:46.610 --> 00:59:49.580
If they're 10% out,
four weeks out,

1099
00:59:49.790 --> 00:59:51.920
then we're going to have a little bit of a different conversation and

1100
00:59:51.921 --> 00:59:56.240
prioritization around the fueling strategies and all of these conversations

1101
00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:59.420
integrate within our strength and conditioning program so that we're working in

1102
00:59:59.421 --> 01:00:04.421
concert and tying in the workload into our own system as well as the training

1103
01:00:05.391 --> 01:00:08.030
load that they're engaging with,
with their skill specific training.

1104
01:00:08.270 --> 01:00:11.750
Now when you vary the Diet that you give them independent dependent of the

1105
01:00:11.751 --> 01:00:13.550
workout,
what does,
what does that based on?

1106
01:00:13.550 --> 01:00:18.550
Is that based on a hard accepted science of carbohydrate versus protein versus

1107
01:00:19.071 --> 01:00:23.250
essential fat essential fatty acids?
Like how do you determine that?
So we,
we,

1108
01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:26.360
we use a philosophy,
a system called metabolic efficiency.

1109
01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:28.970
You could call it metabolic flexibility.
I've heard it called as well.

1110
01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:33.440
And essentially the body will use different substrate at different intensities

1111
01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:37.270
and at low intensities and at rest the body,
uh,

1112
01:00:37.730 --> 01:00:40.940
can and likely should be adapted,
uh,
for our,

1113
01:00:40.970 --> 01:00:45.890
for our sports athletes to,
to fat at rest.
Now it depends on the sport type.

1114
01:00:45.891 --> 01:00:49.550
Again,
if we're a shot putter or if we're a 100 meter sprinter,

1115
01:00:49.850 --> 01:00:52.480
then we're going to be much more dependent on carbohydrates and,
and,

1116
01:00:52.510 --> 01:00:54.320
and really the creatine phosphate system.

1117
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:56.510
We're not even getting into the glycolytic system.

1118
01:00:56.750 --> 01:01:00.480
And Dunkin could talk a lot more about the energy systems,
but essentially we're,

1119
01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:05.330
we're reliant upon glucose and ATP for energy at those lower intensity bursts.

1120
01:01:05.570 --> 01:01:10.280
Right?
So to hit repeated Max or sub Max efforts,
we require blood sugar.

1121
01:01:10.730 --> 01:01:15.230
And without it,
we will deplete our,
our initial stores.

1122
01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:19.550
And then we can't,
we can't,
we can no longer hit 90 or 95% of our Max.

1123
01:01:19.551 --> 01:01:22.260
We start hitting 80 and 70 and 60 and,

1124
01:01:22.261 --> 01:01:25.640
and diminishing our ability to do these high intensity efforts.
Now,

1125
01:01:25.641 --> 01:01:28.940
do you guys see anybody come in and try to fight on a Ketogenic Diet?

1126
01:01:29.210 --> 01:01:31.200
Because I know quite a few guys were doing that for awhile.

1127
01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:35.120
I know Bryan Caraway did it.
Matt Brown.
Yeah,
that's right.
He has fought,

1128
01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:38.750
but he varies and I think he,
yeah,
well I talked to him.

1129
01:01:38.751 --> 01:01:43.070
I think he did one pretty pure and many did.
You know,
he did.
The one where you,

1130
01:01:43.150 --> 01:01:45.730
you know,
you might take in 60 or 80 carbs,
puffin,

1131
01:01:45.770 --> 01:01:47.720
you work them off to stay Kitteridge.
I don't,

1132
01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:52.430
some of those guys like Zack bitter.
Um,
he's a ultra marathon runner.

1133
01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:55.880
He v he does eat ketogenic most of the time,

1134
01:01:55.881 --> 01:02:00.300
but then on days of big races he'll consume a lot of sugars.
And,

1135
01:02:00.830 --> 01:02:04.110
and again I'll insulin sensitivity to,
yeah.

1136
01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:08.210
So essentially the more we can regulate blood sugar at rest and low intensities,

1137
01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:10.000
then we can expand and,

1138
01:02:10.001 --> 01:02:14.120
and to support the development of that kind of a Rubik oxidative system.

1139
01:02:14.630 --> 01:02:17.940
And by adapting to use fat as a primary substrate,
we're,

1140
01:02:17.941 --> 01:02:20.070
we're doing a number of things.
One,
we're balancing blood

1141
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:24.200
<v 1>sugar at rest so that we can really limit the insulin spikes and,</v>

1142
01:02:24.201 --> 01:02:28.920
and essentially adipose development.
Um,
in addition to really

1143
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:35.040
driving the body towards the oxidative and,
or the OC state of aerobic system.

1144
01:02:35.310 --> 01:02:39.700
And then as we increase in,
in what we do is we assess how the body adapts.

1145
01:02:39.701 --> 01:02:41.700
So through the training intensities,

1146
01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:45.060
and we'll repeat that kind of on a monthly basis to see how the athlete changes.

1147
01:02:45.390 --> 01:02:48.600
And then as they increase in the intensity of a training effort,

1148
01:02:48.930 --> 01:02:53.090
then we will adjust the ratio of fat to carbohydrates as,

1149
01:02:53.310 --> 01:02:54.930
as a fuel substrate.

1150
01:02:55.650 --> 01:02:58.290
<v 4>I thought it was going to come up organically,
but it didn't,
uh,</v>

1151
01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:00.840
the Trifecta of five prep systems,

1152
01:03:00.841 --> 01:03:05.670
you guys in your team have grown to 22 events this year.
Indeed.
Take it away.

1153
01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:09.690
All right,
what are you doing?
So I shouldn't have promo here.
Joe Stepped back.

1154
01:03:11.770 --> 01:03:15.640
<v 1>So essentially we're assessing and then we're programming based on each</v>

1155
01:03:15.641 --> 01:03:18.310
athlete's needs.
So,
um,
like for said,

1156
01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:23.340
one of our most valuable partners at the UFC performance institute is meal Prep

1157
01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:25.930
Company,
uh,
called trifecta nutrition.

1158
01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:30.850
And they essentially have all organic meal line that can be,

1159
01:03:30.900 --> 01:03:34.570
uh,
developed all the cart,
uh,
ordered all a cart.

1160
01:03:34.571 --> 01:03:36.220
And so with tomorrow as an example,

1161
01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:41.260
we worked together for his past two fights and and many athletes,
like I said,

1162
01:03:41.710 --> 01:03:42.481
uh,
are,

1163
01:03:42.481 --> 01:03:46.570
are not fueling the type of training in a way that leads to their long term

1164
01:03:46.571 --> 01:03:49.410
adaptation but can lead to overtraining earlier on campus.

1165
01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:53.500
So what we really won't want to do is to understand how that physiology works

1166
01:03:53.501 --> 01:03:56.860
and then program and then provide those athletes with the nutrition,

1167
01:03:56.861 --> 01:03:58.720
whether it's onsite at the,

1168
01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:02.400
<v 4>you've seen performance institute at the event as well as what I was getting at</v>

1169
01:04:02.401 --> 01:04:05.900
like 22 events they go to.
So you think about it like I would,
you know,

1170
01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:10.380
I would literally smuggle oatmeal into Brazil.
Like you're stealing food,

1171
01:04:11.010 --> 01:04:12.810
you know,
they,
they're like,
you get there,

1172
01:04:12.811 --> 01:04:15.720
you know the little thing that says no organic,
the little pass,

1173
01:04:16.650 --> 01:04:21.330
they can go to those fights and actually feed you throughout the week.
Oh Wow.

1174
01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:23.470
That's where I was going with that.
Sorry.
So that's incredible.

1175
01:04:23.550 --> 01:04:25.410
So they would like,
if you had a fight in Stockholm,

1176
01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:29.880
they would come to Stockholm with life.
If it's one of the 22 events.
Oh,
okay.

1177
01:04:30.330 --> 01:04:31.163
So

1178
01:04:32.610 --> 01:04:37.200
they would go and you could get the UFC pie to fuel you through the entire
event.

1179
01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:40.770
<v 1>Yep.
So there's,
there's a a number of levels.
So I'll get there in just one sec.</v>

1180
01:04:40.771 --> 01:04:44.500
But essentially we'll take them through the fight camp,
fuel them for adaptation.

1181
01:04:44.501 --> 01:04:47.910
So they show up to the event,
we know exactly where they are,
they're fueled.

1182
01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:50.970
And then we could take them all the way through the fight.
So 22 events,

1183
01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:53.970
most are domestic except for some the paper views that are,

1184
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000
that are international.
So of the 22,

1185
01:04:57.450 --> 01:04:59.570
the only international ones are the paper views.

1186
01:04:59.610 --> 01:05:03.510
The others are the ESPN events and those are pretty much exclusively domestic.

1187
01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:04.410
But what we,

1188
01:05:04.410 --> 01:05:08.340
what we've done is we've outreached all of the athletes that have crossed paths

1189
01:05:08.341 --> 01:05:12.660
with us at the performance institute.
So it's not,
it's,
it's not roster wide yet.

1190
01:05:12.661 --> 01:05:16.170
As we're working through a lot of the operational stuff,
as an example,
uh,

1191
01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:18.910
we aren't able to get into the kitchen at every hotel.

1192
01:05:19.240 --> 01:05:22.060
So then we're working to find a community kitchen,

1193
01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:25.390
trying to find contacts at local universities,
actually cook them yourself.

1194
01:05:25.391 --> 01:05:30.180
So trifecta hired a chef.
So trifecta,
they're our partner.
Uh,
they,

1195
01:05:30.230 --> 01:05:33.160
they've,
they've been amazing in terms of,
you know,
trying to feed our athletes.

1196
01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:36.070
We identified this as a real need to,
you know,
we,

1197
01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:39.400
we run a marathon with these guys,
right?
Kamara as an example.

1198
01:05:39.410 --> 01:05:40.990
We worked together for three months.

1199
01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:43.990
We get them to a week before the fight and then it's like pat them on the bubble

1200
01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:47.840
and say,
good luck.
We,
as we know,
fueling is,

1201
01:05:47.841 --> 01:05:52.090
is impactful all the way through the fight in,
in including 30 minutes before.

1202
01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:55.360
And so instead of them on the buck and say button saying good luck,

1203
01:05:55.570 --> 01:05:58.450
trifacta hired a chef who I previously worked with the,

1204
01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:01.510
he worked with me at Cornell University,
um,
for,
for a year.

1205
01:06:01.510 --> 01:06:05.170
He was an intern with me.
He worked at Exos for two years and then at a two star,

1206
01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:08.070
two Michelin Star restaurant here in La.
And uh,
uh,

1207
01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:10.480
providence is the name of it and he got hired.

1208
01:06:10.481 --> 01:06:15.481
He's their executive chef and is building out the fight week meals based on me

1209
01:06:15.641 --> 01:06:17.410
and my teams program.

1210
01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:21.390
So we work with every single athlete that we've connected with at the Pi.
Uh,

1211
01:06:21.430 --> 01:06:22.480
it's gotten up to,

1212
01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:26.350
on average between 14 and 16 athletes at all the events that were working.

1213
01:06:26.650 --> 01:06:29.200
And we provide comprehensive fueling.
Uh,

1214
01:06:29.201 --> 01:06:32.830
so all of the food calories that they put in their body from the time they step

1215
01:06:32.831 --> 01:06:36.050
on foot on Tuesday for fighter checking all the way through,
you know,

1216
01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:40.150
30 minutes pre-fight including all the supplements,
NSF,

1217
01:06:40.151 --> 01:06:43.600
third party tested supplements for supplement safety to make sure they're not

1218
01:06:43.601 --> 01:06:44.830
getting adulterated products,

1219
01:06:44.831 --> 01:06:48.220
were keeping track of everything that they're consuming.
On the supplement side.

1220
01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:52.570
We don't sit in the sauna,
we're not there to be a weight cut coach.

1221
01:06:52.810 --> 01:06:56.980
We are the weirdest sports dietetics team to support them on a,
on a,

1222
01:06:56.981 --> 01:07:01.920
on a programming and on,
uh,
you know,
uh,
science evidence base level.
Uh,
so we,

1223
01:07:01.921 --> 01:07:05.140
we,
we will consult with their teams around what's the safe was,

1224
01:07:05.141 --> 01:07:08.290
what's the most effective way to support an athlete making weight.

1225
01:07:08.590 --> 01:07:12.310
And then we instantly,
once they make weight,
we have supplies that was developed,

1226
01:07:12.730 --> 01:07:13.091
cooked,

1227
01:07:13.091 --> 01:07:17.080
prepared by our chefs that morning and the night before to support rehydration

1228
01:07:17.140 --> 01:07:20.470
electrolytes to,
to optimize the gut,

1229
01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:25.700
a repopulation of Gut Microbiota as well as balanced the osmolality so that

1230
01:07:26.261 --> 01:07:28.110
they're not getting gut cramping and,

1231
01:07:28.111 --> 01:07:31.960
and issues that happen when you ingest a ton of sodium and,

1232
01:07:32.070 --> 01:07:34.270
and glycogen or sorry,
in glucose,

1233
01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:36.550
that causes a lot of water to rush into the gut.

1234
01:07:36.970 --> 01:07:41.620
And then we essentially feed them all the way through,
like I said,
breakfast,

1235
01:07:41.621 --> 01:07:44.590
lunch,
and then pre-fight to support their,
their performance on fight night.

1236
01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:48.590
<v 0>Um,
I'm an outspoken spoken critic of cutting weight.</v>

1237
01:07:48.650 --> 01:07:52.670
I don't necessarily think it's the best thing for the sport or for the athlete.

1238
01:07:52.970 --> 01:07:56.690
I mean I think one of the benefits that we would get out of having more weight

1239
01:07:56.691 --> 01:08:00.410
classes available at fires could get their body to the weight class where

1240
01:08:00.411 --> 01:08:02.960
they're optimally at.
Has there ever been any discussion?

1241
01:08:02.961 --> 01:08:07.820
I know you guys have had discussions about ped usage and how to stop adulterated

1242
01:08:07.821 --> 01:08:11.180
supplements from getting to fighters and making people test positive.

1243
01:08:11.181 --> 01:08:16.040
But what about some longterm goal of eliminating

1244
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:18.140
<v 1>weight,
cutting the way they've eliminated pds?</v>

1245
01:08:19.250 --> 01:08:21.410
So as we already talked about,

1246
01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:24.590
I come from college wrestling tragically in 1997,

1247
01:08:24.591 --> 01:08:28.190
three college wrestlers died in Florida.

1248
01:08:28.191 --> 01:08:31.430
Of course it's always Florida,
was it?
No

1249
01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:36.290
one was at the University of Michigan.
And uh,
I,
I'm not,

1250
01:08:36.410 --> 01:08:37.790
I'm not exactly sure where the other two were,

1251
01:08:37.800 --> 01:08:41.180
but let's pretend there were Florida,
let's say Florida to feels like Florida.

1252
01:08:41.181 --> 01:08:42.710
Florida is just going to shake their head anyway,

1253
01:08:43.110 --> 01:08:44.500
not even going to check except it,

1254
01:08:45.170 --> 01:08:49.950
but the NCAA dramatically overhauled their way in rules,
um,

1255
01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:53.450
from the day before to the day off.

1256
01:08:53.570 --> 01:08:57.740
And there are a lot of similarities in terms of the types of athletes that are

1257
01:08:57.741 --> 01:09:01.850
wrestling versus the types of athletes that are competing in MMA.

1258
01:09:02.450 --> 01:09:07.450
But we work in and we work with professional athletes and we work for a

1259
01:09:08.271 --> 01:09:10.480
professional fight promotion and,

1260
01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:15.540
and the dynamics of a professional fight promoter is completely different than

1261
01:09:17.361 --> 01:09:19.970
the NCAA and the re the re,

1262
01:09:20.020 --> 01:09:24.360
the level of autonomy with our independent contractors versus the incident

1263
01:09:24.430 --> 01:09:28.900
athletes is different.
And we as the UFC,
WWE,
you know,

1264
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:33.380
the performance is do we have the health and safety of our fighters in mind at

1265
01:09:33.381 --> 01:09:36.020
all times.
And,
and that's priority number one.
And I've,

1266
01:09:36.250 --> 01:09:39.790
I've had to literally call the ambulance on athletes that,

1267
01:09:39.791 --> 01:09:43.490
that I've seen not doing well because of healthy health considerations.

1268
01:09:43.570 --> 01:09:47.240
Now you personally,
how do you feel about it?
About weight cut out?
We cut.

1269
01:09:47.490 --> 01:09:52.460
I would like to,
um,
I personally would like to make it safer.
Um,

1270
01:09:52.610 --> 01:09:57.470
there,
there,
there are,
uh,
there are less than ideal.

1271
01:09:57.950 --> 01:10:01.910
Um,
I think safety concerns,
you know,

1272
01:10:01.911 --> 01:10:06.020
that we've all heard of and you know,
a lot of us have seen,
um,
and,
and from,

1273
01:10:06.021 --> 01:10:10.790
from my perspective,
the closer that you can bring it to,
to the fight,

1274
01:10:10.791 --> 01:10:15.260
the better.
But because of the promotional nature of the UFC,
it's limited.

1275
01:10:15.261 --> 01:10:20.120
And then we have,
we have limited ability to affect change,

1276
01:10:21.170 --> 01:10:25.310
et cetera.
The commissions,
the commissions really are the ones that are,
are,
are,

1277
01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:30.640
<v 4>I don't really make him a rule like that asshole.
But Dude,
pick your way class,</v>

1278
01:10:30.670 --> 01:10:34.660
make the weight or just say,
you know,
I'm not going to be able to do it.

1279
01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:36.700
I've got to move up.
Right.
You know,

1280
01:10:36.730 --> 01:10:40.210
like it was always hard for me to admit to a five,
but you know,

1281
01:10:40.211 --> 01:10:44.230
I didn't really want to fight heavyweight and I made it and towards the end of

1282
01:10:44.231 --> 01:10:47.920
my career I walked around like,
you know,
I used to get pretty big and I was like,

1283
01:10:47.921 --> 01:10:50.890
Hey,
I don't want to do that.
I want to be a professional,
be a professional.

1284
01:10:50.891 --> 01:10:54.550
It comes back to the whole,
I hate keeps saying up with the 52 week fight camp.

1285
01:10:55.010 --> 01:10:55.570
All right,

1286
01:10:55.570 --> 01:11:00.400
like do you need to get 20% over your fight weight if you're 20% over your fight

1287
01:11:00.401 --> 01:11:04.600
weight,
that's not your fight weight.
You know,
just making very good points.

1288
01:11:04.601 --> 01:11:08.410
Just just,
I mean you can,
there are weight classes.
All right,

1289
01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:11.470
maybe there needs to be a way class,
like every,
well there it is.

1290
01:11:11.471 --> 01:11:14.190
Like every 10 days,
10 pounds.
Okay,
well every

1291
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:19.190
<v 2>10% so I think percent's a lot more important than the other thing is maybe in</v>

1292
01:11:21.301 --> 01:11:22.230
time it will happen.

1293
01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:27.470
There's 570 athletes is not enough to fill that many weight classes and then you

1294
01:11:28.051 --> 01:11:31.830
know,
you're a boxing guy or you,
you know,
then you get away class.

1295
01:11:32.190 --> 01:11:35.610
I'm just going to run around and we're going to have fights every three pounds

1296
01:11:35.611 --> 01:11:38.240
and then it,
then it becomes a little,
hmm.
Well,

1297
01:11:38.250 --> 01:11:41.040
I don't know if that's necessarily the men.
There's like 27 belts.

1298
01:11:41.041 --> 01:11:44.010
How much time do they have?
Really clearly is that it's an,

1299
01:11:45.690 --> 01:11:50.100
it's an unnecessary risk to have a guy dehydrate themselves or a girl dehydrates

1300
01:11:50.101 --> 01:11:53.100
and seltzer that literally to the point of going to the fucking hospital 24

1301
01:11:53.101 --> 01:11:55.680
hours before a cage fight isn't saying,
if you could eliminate that,

1302
01:11:55.681 --> 01:11:57.870
why wouldn't you?
That's the number one thing.

1303
01:11:57.871 --> 01:12:02.130
I think there's no benefit whatsoever to making people dehydrate themselves 24

1304
01:12:02.131 --> 01:12:04.230
hours before a cage fight.
It seems crazy that,
no,

1305
01:12:04.231 --> 01:12:07.030
nobody's going to disagree with you,
but we,
wow.

1306
01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:10.290
What's the best way to figure it out?
The best way to figure it out is to,

1307
01:12:10.350 --> 01:12:10.921
first of all,

1308
01:12:10.921 --> 01:12:15.420
you can definitely avoid a lot of struggle and tragedy by figuring it out.
Right?

1309
01:12:15.450 --> 01:12:19.640
I mean the,
the fights that happen where,
wait,
we're fighters,
um,

1310
01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:23.430
in several organizations cut weight and died during that process.

1311
01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:26.610
That's heartbreaking.
You know,
if we could avoid that,

1312
01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:28.920
it's already dangerous sport as it is.

1313
01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:32.260
We are collecting data at the performance institute.
We,

1314
01:12:32.290 --> 01:12:37.290
we all have some opinions around what works best in terms of reducing the

1315
01:12:37.531 --> 01:12:38.430
extreme way.
Cutting,

1316
01:12:38.610 --> 01:12:41.730
creating some competitive parody in the cage I think is a really,

1317
01:12:42.420 --> 01:12:46.530
really critical points so that it d incentivizes that process.
Yeah.

1318
01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:49.500
If you can't be as big in the cage will then,
right.

1319
01:12:49.600 --> 01:12:52.110
Then there's not as much of a benefit.
The problem,

1320
01:12:52.710 --> 01:12:56.460
well it is a very complex problem and the regulation and in mixed martial arts

1321
01:12:56.820 --> 01:12:58.110
is such that we,

1322
01:12:58.140 --> 01:13:02.670
the promoter and we abide by the regulations of every single state athletic

1323
01:13:02.671 --> 01:13:05.610
commission.
And so we are,
we are collecting data.

1324
01:13:05.940 --> 01:13:09.050
So that we can understand the issue better.
We're co,
you know,

1325
01:13:09.060 --> 01:13:13.350
we're working to come to an understanding to then share with those that are the,

1326
01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:18.090
the,
the legislators of the system so that they can help make it safer as well

1327
01:13:18.091 --> 01:13:22.860
because it's not just a unilateral decision where we tell our employees what you

1328
01:13:22.861 --> 01:13:27.290
do.
We have,
we have 570 independent contractors.
So each of us has,

1329
01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:31.060
has some strong beliefs and opinions in this space and I,

1330
01:13:31.150 --> 01:13:35.910
I value years and I really respect that the passion you bring to it.
Um,
this is,

1331
01:13:35.911 --> 01:13:38.780
this is my passion as well.
That's why I came to the UFC is to,

1332
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:43.710
to impact this culture and hopefully on the policy side as well.
But it's a very,

1333
01:13:43.711 --> 01:13:47.270
very complex system that we're working to,
to kind of,
you know,

1334
01:13:47.430 --> 01:13:51.720
infiltrate or to effect from the inside.
I truly understand that it's complex,

1335
01:13:51.721 --> 01:13:54.510
but if you could wave a magic wand and not have weight cutting,

1336
01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:58.680
wouldn't you do it?
Fuck yeah.
Yeah.
Nobody's disagreeing with that.

1337
01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:02.850
Why not just listen to you magic that they can do that one fc is doing it.

1338
01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:03.840
It can be done.
You just,

1339
01:14:03.890 --> 01:14:07.020
you have a program where you make sure that people move up a weight class,

1340
01:14:07.230 --> 01:14:11.070
they don't,
you have hydration tests.
You make sure that they're never,

1341
01:14:11.230 --> 01:14:12.130
never really taxing

1342
01:14:12.130 --> 01:14:13.930
<v 0>out.
Like some guys,
we've seen some guys,</v>

1343
01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:17.950
I've seen guys shuffle to this to the scale cause they couldn't walk.

1344
01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:22.210
We've all seen where guys are literally on death's door 24 hours for a cage

1345
01:14:22.211 --> 01:14:24.100
fight.
That's crazy.
Have you could eliminate that.

1346
01:14:24.210 --> 01:14:27.220
I can mend one of c for trying.

1347
01:14:27.490 --> 01:14:30.090
There's holes in that system just like there's tools in any sense,

1348
01:14:30.670 --> 01:14:33.040
but let's always going to try and game the system.

1349
01:14:33.950 --> 01:14:36.330
They're trying to game the system as well.

1350
01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:40.120
Well I remember being on a stick that you are accurate.
Go buy and Walmart.

1351
01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:43.840
Those aren't that easy to be or that those aren't hard to beat the hydration

1352
01:14:43.841 --> 01:14:47.330
tests.
Yeah.
Nope.
They're not.
You know,
you're 100% right.
I mean,

1353
01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:49.960
but it's more more,

1354
01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:53.750
it's more protected that it's more difficult to do.
They have a,

1355
01:14:53.890 --> 01:14:57.130
they have a far different regulatory system than we have as well.

1356
01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:01.960
We have 50 independent state regulators.
We have combined Jay down.

1357
01:15:01.990 --> 01:15:06.680
Yeah.
Down in Brazil we have different regulators.
It's,
it's very complex and,

1358
01:15:06.681 --> 01:15:10.150
and I think that we obviously here at the table and it,

1359
01:15:10.151 --> 01:15:14.410
the performance is to have,
have that as a,
as a primary kind of area of focus.

1360
01:15:15.010 --> 01:15:18.650
But we're,
we're,
we're working to affect the systems that can,

1361
01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:23.500
what Clinton,
his team are doing is,
let's see the dad,
like,

1362
01:15:23.501 --> 01:15:27.430
let's collect the battle,
let's figure out what it looks like.
You know,
what,
what,

1363
01:15:27.431 --> 01:15:27.610
uh,

1364
01:15:27.610 --> 01:15:30.610
Don has been doing for the last couple of years collecting every fight weight.

1365
01:15:30.810 --> 01:15:34.210
Let's see.
You know,
let's,
let's look at the bat and figure it out from there.

1366
01:15:34.720 --> 01:15:38.680
Yeah.
Um,
it's,
uh,
it's just such a,

1367
01:15:39.010 --> 01:15:42.670
it's such an unfortunate aspect of it that I get has been there from the

1368
01:15:42.671 --> 01:15:46.270
beginning or at least from the time that weight classes started being
instituted.

1369
01:15:46.630 --> 01:15:51.310
Um,
but it just seems to me that boy,
if there was a way to avoid that,

1370
01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:56.650
they had to had it.
Right.
The Gi guys rather that throwed with the Gi guys.

1371
01:15:56.670 --> 01:16:01.480
Are Those added like Jerry,
wait,
yeah.
We'll go back to that.
Yeah.

1372
01:16:01.510 --> 01:16:05.890
The cage fighting pretty hard by itself.
Yes it is.
Yeah.
I just,
um,

1373
01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:09.500
we don't call it a cage Friday,
we call it octagonal struggle.

1374
01:16:09.990 --> 01:16:14.320
We've got a PC that shit out.
Yeah.
Well you see cage fighting.
People go,

1375
01:16:14.321 --> 01:16:17.800
what did he say?
Oh,
mixed martial arts.
Oh,
you mean like the UFC?
I love Ron.

1376
01:16:17.801 --> 01:16:21.970
Drowsy.
Yeah.
I'm a big fan.
Hey,
it's about your messaging and sometimes,

1377
01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:24.070
yeah.
Accepted that.

1378
01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:28.210
Do you guys have a longterm plans for expansion of a,

1379
01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:31.180
the treatments and different things you do?
Do you have like a look,

1380
01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:34.810
is this something that you guys are constantly working on improving?

1381
01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:39.660
<v 5>Yeah,
I mean absolutely.
The,
the sports science landscape is vast,
you know,
and,</v>

1382
01:16:39.661 --> 01:16:42.320
and we try to keep abreast of all the ladies technologies,

1383
01:16:42.321 --> 01:16:45.050
the advantage in theory and philosophy.
So yeah,

1384
01:16:45.051 --> 01:16:46.850
that's at the heart of everything we do.
You know,

1385
01:16:46.851 --> 01:16:51.470
we're trying to and stay at the cutting edge of sports performance.
So

1386
01:16:51.600 --> 01:16:52.610
<v 0>how does that,
does,</v>

1387
01:16:52.630 --> 01:16:55.170
do you have to go to conferences and find out what the latest stuff guys are

1388
01:16:55.171 --> 01:16:55.770
doing?

1389
01:16:55.770 --> 01:16:58.470
<v 5>I mean,
I,
you know,
I did the math this week actually.
You know,</v>

1390
01:16:58.750 --> 01:17:01.710
I always say the church isn't the building,
the church is a people,

1391
01:17:01.711 --> 01:17:06.711
our staff has got a combined experience in pro and elite sports of 106 years.

1392
01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:11.060
We've got 18 Olympic Games supported within our staff alone.
Wow.
Okay.

1393
01:17:11.061 --> 01:17:15.960
So our people,
our staff,
our what is so precious to the performance institute,
um,

1394
01:17:15.970 --> 01:17:20.000
and we're very proud of our staff and their respective world leaders in their

1395
01:17:20.001 --> 01:17:24.380
own individual areas.
Um,
well yeah,
of course you have to go and speak to people.

1396
01:17:24.381 --> 01:17:28.010
Of course you've got to listen to seminars and collect and gather information or

1397
01:17:28.011 --> 01:17:32.110
conferences or what are you going to do is process it.
You know,
there's,

1398
01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:36.680
there's this,
there's a lot of pseudo science and Bro Science out there,
you know,

1399
01:17:36.690 --> 01:17:41.170
so you've got,
you love that word,
right?
Yeah.
It's a real problem.
So,
you know,
the,

1400
01:17:41.171 --> 01:17:45.830
the ability to process it is what makes the difference,
you know,
but

1401
01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:50.470
<v 4>valid are about,
everybody can be fortunate enough.
I don't even have to be smart.</v>

1402
01:17:50.471 --> 01:17:52.480
I just went out and found a bunch of smart people.

1403
01:17:52.510 --> 01:17:55.280
Does it make you take notes when they make you sit on these conferences?

1404
01:17:55.360 --> 01:18:00.310
Honestly used to really like try to obscure myself and everything and at some

1405
01:18:00.311 --> 01:18:03.730
point I was like,
Nah,
Nah,
just hey Clint,
come here.

1406
01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:07.270
I've got a crushed now in terms of uh,
like recovery stuff,

1407
01:18:07.271 --> 01:18:11.970
I know you guys had a hot pool,
like a sauna or a Jacuzzi rather.
It was

1408
01:18:12.020 --> 01:18:16.130
<v 5>right next to a cold plunge.
How much of that stuff do you guys do and what,
what,</v>

1409
01:18:16.131 --> 01:18:20.800
what equipment do you guys keep the risk?
Again,
both Sandoval,

1410
01:18:20.850 --> 01:18:24.280
who's our head of strategy directors during the conditioning puts it,
you know,

1411
01:18:24.281 --> 01:18:28.490
intimately in terms of the,
in the UFC,
everyone's training hat,
you know,
every,

1412
01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:28.630
you know,

1413
01:18:28.630 --> 01:18:31.540
you're not training harder than the guy next to you or in the gym next to you.

1414
01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:32.090
What,

1415
01:18:32.090 --> 01:18:36.190
what is the key is how fast you can recover and train again at the intensity

1416
01:18:36.191 --> 01:18:40.030
that you need to the day after day after day and be robust enough to tolerate

1417
01:18:40.031 --> 01:18:44.220
that.
So recovery and regeneration is just as important as the training.

1418
01:18:44.221 --> 01:18:45.220
And exposure.
In fact,

1419
01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:49.510
your body obviously changes and adapts during the recovery and regeneration

1420
01:18:49.511 --> 01:18:53.350
process.
So yeah,
listen,
we've got hot tubs,
we've got aquatic capabilities,

1421
01:18:53.351 --> 01:18:56.460
we've got cryotherapy,
we've got compression,
we've got,
you know,

1422
01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:59.410
everything that you would expect in a,
in a,
in a world class facility.

1423
01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:03.460
What we're starting to do is really try to be a bit more prescriptive around

1424
01:19:03.461 --> 01:19:06.310
that.
Um,
as,
as clinics already talked about,
you know,

1425
01:19:06.550 --> 01:19:11.320
it makes no sense to us to look at a high neuromuscular striking session where

1426
01:19:11.321 --> 01:19:15.340
you're hitting myths or hitting bags and use the same recovery strategy as a

1427
01:19:15.341 --> 01:19:19.360
high metabolic grappling session.
These are totally different physiology,

1428
01:19:19.690 --> 01:19:21.340
physiology challenges.
So yeah,

1429
01:19:21.341 --> 01:19:25.630
to be prescriptive and to be a bit more strategic in our approach.
Um,

1430
01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:27.790
but at the end of the day,
what is core quarter recovery?

1431
01:19:27.791 --> 01:19:29.590
It's such a personal thing.
You know,

1432
01:19:30.100 --> 01:19:32.380
some people don't like getting in the cryotherapy chamber.

1433
01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:33.550
Some people can't swim,

1434
01:19:33.551 --> 01:19:36.910
so they're not going to get in the water and do hot cold plunges.
It's just,

1435
01:19:36.970 --> 01:19:41.390
it's going to stress them out more.
So,
you know,
hey,
go in here.

1436
01:19:41.980 --> 01:19:46.070
Drown.
It'll help you recover.
It's not that deep.
It's not that deep.
But there's,

1437
01:19:46.090 --> 01:19:49.040
you know,
there's some people just cut the fear of water cause you can't swim,

1438
01:19:49.041 --> 01:19:53.790
you know,
so they do about baths while shower too.

1439
01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:56.280
Crazy.
Your mom,
when you smell,

1440
01:19:56.380 --> 01:19:59.710
do you guys have a sauna on premises as well?
We do.

1441
01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:03.100
Do you have guys go from the sauna into the cold plunge?

1442
01:20:03.330 --> 01:20:07.430
<v 4>Me Personally.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's supposed to be a great benefit of,
right.
Yeah,</v>

1443
01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:08.040
for sure.

1444
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:11.100
<v 5>And again,
you,
you know,
you've had Andy Galpin on about all these Brian,</v>

1445
01:20:11.101 --> 01:20:14.320
Mackenzie,
all these people that breathing also.

1446
01:20:14.990 --> 01:20:18.210
There's a lot of information Rau around recovery,

1447
01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:23.010
but it's still a massive gray area massage.
Do you have that on staff as well?

1448
01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:26.490
Absolutely.
I therapists can do they do like,
uh,
like um,

1449
01:20:26.550 --> 01:20:29.930
raw feeling that kind of like deep tissue stuff.
Graston and all that though.

1450
01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.560
How often do you guys recommend that for athletes?
Because the,
the,

1451
01:20:32.580 --> 01:20:34.290
the Soviets for a long period of time,

1452
01:20:34.291 --> 01:20:37.020
it was really shocking when we found out they weren't massaging their athletes

1453
01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:41.400
every day.
And,
uh,
there's,
there's debate as to whether or not that's good or bad.

1454
01:20:41.430 --> 01:20:44.480
Like what are you thoughts on that?
Well,
I think what Heather,
who's a director,

1455
01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:47.390
a director of PT will tell you is that the,

1456
01:20:47.730 --> 01:20:52.680
the Fascia and the fighter posture and the way he fights is,

1457
01:20:52.681 --> 01:20:55.980
are putting their bodies through particular challenges obviously creates a lot

1458
01:20:55.981 --> 01:20:59.190
of muscle tone and it creates a lot of tightness in the Fascia and just methods

1459
01:20:59.191 --> 01:21:01.180
and mechanisms to free that up to,

1460
01:21:01.220 --> 01:21:06.220
to allow the joints and the articulation of the body to work effectively is

1461
01:21:07.171 --> 01:21:11.390
huge.
If you have greater than a,
I'm trying to remember the numbers,
but a,
uh,

1462
01:21:11.460 --> 01:21:13.020
at a,
um,

1463
01:21:13.260 --> 01:21:16.980
a 10 to 20% imbalance in a joint within your body,

1464
01:21:17.370 --> 01:21:21.510
you now have a 70 to 90% chance of injury that,
that joint,
right?

1465
01:21:21.690 --> 01:21:22.650
So just the,
the,

1466
01:21:22.680 --> 01:21:26.130
the difference in terms of symmetry and balance within the body and its

1467
01:21:26.131 --> 01:21:28.940
influence on injury is massive.
So why,
why,

1468
01:21:29.290 --> 01:21:34.140
why not be proactive in trying to utilize manual therapies and recovery

1469
01:21:34.141 --> 01:21:38.160
modalities rather than working in a reactive process and waiting for the injury

1470
01:21:38.161 --> 01:21:39.360
to happen.
And again,
that's,

1471
01:21:39.361 --> 01:21:44.130
that's core of our philosophy is that there's been a big shift in the barometer

1472
01:21:44.131 --> 01:21:46.680
for,
for some of the fighters that come through the performance institute,

1473
01:21:46.950 --> 01:21:47.131
you know,

1474
01:21:47.131 --> 01:21:50.430
the clinic and the therapy is somewhere where you go and you're injured.
Well,

1475
01:21:50.431 --> 01:21:50.671
you know,

1476
01:21:50.671 --> 01:21:54.180
what we do is we promote it just as much as the strength and conditioning piece.

1477
01:21:54.420 --> 01:21:58.740
So when you talking about range of motion,
you including flexibility exercises,

1478
01:21:58.741 --> 01:22:01.930
do you guys incorporate a lot of that stuff as well?
Oh,
for sure.
But again,
it's,

1479
01:22:01.931 --> 01:22:05.930
it's,
you know,
the faders tend to be pretty flexible.
Um,
so again,
it's,

1480
01:22:05.931 --> 01:22:08.090
it's on an individual level,
but most strikers,

1481
01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:11.010
most people can kick in the head in the UFC.
That'd be pretty flexible

1482
01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:16.260
<v 4>in individual orthopedic assessment.
Right?
So I am,
this is tight.
That is tight.</v>

1483
01:22:16.261 --> 01:22:18.930
I would need to loosen you up.
We're going to put that in your routine,
right?

1484
01:22:18.931 --> 01:22:23.040
So everything is needs analysis driven,
right?
So,
you know,

1485
01:22:23.070 --> 01:22:26.220
Brown or Tigger don't need to be any more flexible.
We can throw us,
put his legs,

1486
01:22:26.310 --> 01:22:28.740
he just needs to maintain his current flux moon.
Right?

1487
01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:30.470
<v 5>So you,</v>

1488
01:22:30.470 --> 01:22:34.080
it completely varies and if you've got like a stiff wrestler with someone who's

1489
01:22:34.081 --> 01:22:37.080
like,
just never really worked on there about the combat posture,

1490
01:22:37.081 --> 01:22:40.230
that internal rotation,
that combat posture where you constantly throw.

1491
01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:42.900
And then we just chronically doing that year after year,

1492
01:22:42.901 --> 01:22:45.760
he's going to set you up for some amount of tightness in terms of fascist.

1493
01:22:45.761 --> 01:22:49.930
So again,
I don't want to go outside of my scope of expertise,
but um,
we're,

1494
01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:51.940
we're very proactive in promoting fighters,

1495
01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:55.590
using modalities proactively rather than reactively.

1496
01:22:55.591 --> 01:23:00.591
So say if a fighter came in and they did a hard grappling workout and uh,

1497
01:23:01.350 --> 01:23:04.350
after the training,
what would you recommend and how much time?

1498
01:23:04.530 --> 01:23:05.980
Cause there's some thought that

1499
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:08.530
<v 3>the body should exist in an inflamed state.</v>

1500
01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:13.800
Postworkout to fall zone depends on the phase of training and also for a certain

1501
01:23:15.221 --> 01:23:16.330
amount of time,
right?

1502
01:23:16.410 --> 01:23:19.930
And then there's more of a benefit of going into cryotherapy after like an hour

1503
01:23:19.931 --> 01:23:24.670
or so.
It's where the benefits and the risks,
again,
if,
if you're off camp,

1504
01:23:24.671 --> 01:23:25.450
what are you trying to do?

1505
01:23:25.450 --> 01:23:29.230
You're trying to break down your buddy so it can be overloaded and recover

1506
01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:33.940
better.
You know,
you,
you use not super compensation to take it to a new level of,

1507
01:23:33.941 --> 01:23:36.760
of,
of adaptation encounter.

1508
01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:38.650
When you're shopping in the knife ready for the fight,

1509
01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:41.950
you want to remove any type of fatigue because you're getting close to the
fight.

1510
01:23:41.951 --> 01:23:45.940
You need to optimize your training and all those peak to the performance and

1511
01:23:45.941 --> 01:23:48.980
fight night.
So,
you know,
there's gotta be a strategic,
we've got a paradise,

1512
01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:53.220
you recovery as you appeared as you're training loads in camp or off camp.
Um,

1513
01:23:53.470 --> 01:23:53.810
but yeah,

1514
01:23:53.810 --> 01:23:57.790
there's different approaches in different modalities that you've got to utilize.

1515
01:23:57.940 --> 01:24:02.380
So if you look at grappling and the metabolic demand that goes into the

1516
01:24:02.381 --> 01:24:06.700
wrestling and the grappling and that,
that's a lactic lactate kind of response.

1517
01:24:06.701 --> 01:24:10.270
That's a,
um,
you know,
a circulatory issue in terms of those,

1518
01:24:10.570 --> 01:24:14.170
those metal metabolites are circling around the body.
You've got to remove those.

1519
01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:17.410
All right.
So is that going to be something like a muscle pump,

1520
01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:20.680
tape recovery strategy that will help it remove it through the,

1521
01:24:20.710 --> 01:24:22.300
through the liver and into the lymph system?

1522
01:24:22.340 --> 01:24:25.600
I mean like one of those compressions and it might be a compression pant or it

1523
01:24:25.601 --> 01:24:28.820
might be hot,
cold,
hot,
cold.
The,

1524
01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:32.050
that the vessels will expand in the heart and the contract in the college you

1525
01:24:32.051 --> 01:24:33.610
get a natural kind of muscle pump.

1526
01:24:33.670 --> 01:24:36.910
And how many times you ask fighters to do that when they do a hot cold thing?

1527
01:24:36.910 --> 01:24:39.720
Do they do deserve a sequence?
Yeah,
I mean we,
we,

1528
01:24:39.721 --> 01:24:42.730
we have a preferred methodology right now it's about three,

1529
01:24:42.910 --> 01:24:47.530
three to four minutes,
four times in each,
uh,
just go back and forth,

1530
01:24:47.531 --> 01:24:48.790
four minutes finishing the call.

1531
01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:52.690
You look at other other experts and other professionals in the field,

1532
01:24:52.691 --> 01:24:55.820
they'll say,
sit in the cold bath for 20 minutes.
You know,
so it's,

1533
01:24:56.290 --> 01:24:58.060
there's still not the science,

1534
01:24:58.061 --> 01:25:00.820
not that the data and information out there to really support.

1535
01:25:00.830 --> 01:25:03.860
So how do you optimize them?

1536
01:25:03.861 --> 01:25:08.440
How do you know whether or not it's having that much of a benefit compared to

1537
01:25:08.441 --> 01:25:11.830
not doing that?
Ask the guy I'll suggest.

1538
01:25:14.070 --> 01:25:18.550
Yeah,
number one subjective.
Do you feel better?
You know,
the,
the,

1539
01:25:18.551 --> 01:25:21.280
there might be no science around cryotherapy.
I'm not suggesting that,

1540
01:25:21.281 --> 01:25:23.530
but there might be no,
no,
no data and no science on it.

1541
01:25:23.560 --> 01:25:27.610
But if the guy walks out three minutes later and feels like crystal mine and his

1542
01:25:27.611 --> 01:25:31.580
body is fresh,
it's,
it's kind of worked,
right?
Yeah.
Well the norepinephrine,

1543
01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:35.350
the raising of the levels of it due to extreme cold exposure,

1544
01:25:35.351 --> 01:25:38.000
I think that's been proven.
I think cytokine developer,

1545
01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:43.380
he shot cold shock proteins and heat shock proteins,
both of them.

1546
01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:47.900
That's all proven stuff in terms of measuring the actual inflammatory markers in

1547
01:25:47.910 --> 01:25:49.570
the body.
But some people don't like it.

1548
01:25:50.040 --> 01:25:53.520
I'm just making the point that if you like that stimulation and you like that

1549
01:25:53.530 --> 01:25:56.230
sensation and you walk out,
you can forget the physiology.

1550
01:25:56.231 --> 01:25:59.290
Cause now we're tapping into psychology and that's still part of the recovery

1551
01:25:59.291 --> 01:26:03.970
process is it's beneficial for sure.
We're going to say,
have no idea.
So

1552
01:26:04.110 --> 01:26:05.330
<v 2>it was important.
No,</v>

1553
01:26:05.331 --> 01:26:09.350
I was going to say I will side track just in terms of recovery.

1554
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:12.800
Nutrition is a core value of the recovery process as well.

1555
01:26:12.801 --> 01:26:17.360
So as much cryotherapy is you do,
if you're not recovering stimulating muscle,

1556
01:26:17.450 --> 01:26:17.870
you know,

1557
01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:22.120
converting from catabolism do anabolism providing nutrients for substrate

1558
01:26:22.190 --> 01:26:25.790
regeneration,
that's a critical component as well.
So that,
that,
that's,

1559
01:26:25.791 --> 01:26:26.624
that's critical.

1560
01:26:26.690 --> 01:26:30.470
What we aren't doing is providing tart cherry juice or hide antioxidants

1561
01:26:30.471 --> 01:26:33.670
immediately post training as well.
That yeah,
we'll,
we'll include that in,

1562
01:26:33.671 --> 01:26:37.370
in other periods of the day,
in the evening or,
or not,

1563
01:26:37.371 --> 01:26:41.150
or not immediately around a high intensity training session for an antioxidant

1564
01:26:41.151 --> 01:26:44.330
negative aspect of an intoxicant suppose training similar it,

1565
01:26:44.350 --> 01:26:48.760
it limits it blunts the adaptive response based on the,
the,

1566
01:26:48.770 --> 01:26:52.540
the body's recovery process.
So if you,
if you blunt your,

1567
01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:56.550
your immune response to,
uh,
to,
uh,
uh,

1568
01:26:56.670 --> 01:27:01.340
microtrauma muscle tears that need to be re rebuild stronger and faster,

1569
01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:03.500
well then you,
you limit the adaptation.
So yeah,

1570
01:27:03.501 --> 01:27:05.720
we want to provide nutrients to support recovery,

1571
01:27:06.110 --> 01:27:09.440
but we don't want to eliminate the adaptive response to,

1572
01:27:09.441 --> 01:27:12.020
to the training sessions.
That's what's so fascinating about the science of it,

1573
01:27:12.021 --> 01:27:12.950
that you can get that,

1574
01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:17.270
that specific that you know that if you consume the high levels of antioxidants

1575
01:27:17.440 --> 01:27:22.100
post-training,
it's going to blunt the recovery time.
That's so amazing.
Curcumin,

1576
01:27:22.250 --> 01:27:23.090
tart cherry juice,

1577
01:27:23.150 --> 01:27:26.990
there's a number of of spices that are included in a lot of different things.

1578
01:27:26.991 --> 01:27:31.010
So whether it's cooking or or in our supplement protocol that we will include,

1579
01:27:31.011 --> 01:27:33.250
but we're,
we're going to target them away from the high intensity,

1580
01:27:33.350 --> 01:27:35.680
far away from the high intensity track.
Couple hours,
couple hours.

1581
01:27:35.870 --> 01:27:39.890
<v 3>I mean it comes back to you can kind of fights it,
kind of coach process,</v>

1582
01:27:39.891 --> 01:27:43.190
all this information.
Can they physically be aware of it,

1583
01:27:43.220 --> 01:27:47.750
where the catch is giving it back,
write it down.
So again,

1584
01:27:48.110 --> 01:27:51.800
let us do some of the grunt work performance institute and we can give you some

1585
01:27:51.801 --> 01:27:55.580
of the education.
I'll tell you how I feel and then we'll come back.

1586
01:27:55.581 --> 01:27:58.610
We'll talk about it and maybe the changes coaches in gyms don't have to feel

1587
01:27:58.611 --> 01:28:01.820
like you're trying to poach them and take them away and bring them to a new

1588
01:28:01.821 --> 01:28:03.020
player.
That's the beautiful thing about it.

1589
01:28:03.021 --> 01:28:05.120
It's like it's open to everybody who fights for the UFC.

1590
01:28:05.121 --> 01:28:08.330
And the other thing which I would say is this,
this is at no cost to the fights.

1591
01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:11.750
It's all right.
It's also that choice when they're independent contractors,

1592
01:28:11.751 --> 01:28:15.560
they can decide how much they want to engage with us as much or as little as

1593
01:28:15.561 --> 01:28:19.220
they want.
And again,
that's the same with the trifecta program for meal prep.

1594
01:28:19.221 --> 01:28:21.860
It's the same with our strength and conditioning program.
So again,
it's,

1595
01:28:21.861 --> 01:28:24.470
it's all bespoke and customized program in at their expense,

1596
01:28:24.550 --> 01:28:28.910
at no cost to the fence.
It's so exciting for me because having seen the fight,

1597
01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.840
the fights and the um,
the,

1598
01:28:30.841 --> 01:28:34.250
the sport and the level of sport evolve over all these years,

1599
01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:37.640
it's so exciting to see constant and continuing innovation.

1600
01:28:37.641 --> 01:28:41.300
And when you guys came along and built this thing and I had a chance to go and

1601
01:28:41.301 --> 01:28:45.530
visit,
I was so excited because they're like,
this is just as what man,

1602
01:28:45.531 --> 01:28:48.390
every sport needs something like this.
But the fact that the UFC has this,

1603
01:28:48.420 --> 01:28:51.710
do some testing combined,
do some testing to find out I'm old,

1604
01:28:52.530 --> 01:28:56.270
we knew where are you more old than other hand.
Not My left hip.

1605
01:28:56.271 --> 01:28:58.610
I fell down skiing.
What would make it great?
Sorry,

1606
01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:00.230
can you make a great point because what's,

1607
01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:02.160
what's been one of the really exciting things

1608
01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:03.750
<v 5>for us and refreshing,
um,</v>

1609
01:29:03.751 --> 01:29:08.510
also for the UFC performance institute is that sports like the NFL,
the NBA,
um,

1610
01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:08.940
you know,

1611
01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:12.450
the English Premiere League where I'm in representatives from all of these
teams,

1612
01:29:12.451 --> 01:29:17.220
NHL co coming through and trying to understand or just be trying to understand

1613
01:29:17.221 --> 01:29:17.911
what we're doing,

1614
01:29:17.911 --> 01:29:21.750
how we're working our sports science into the sport of mixed martial arts and to

1615
01:29:21.751 --> 01:29:25.020
try and capture our philosophy and our approach from a facility development

1616
01:29:25.021 --> 01:29:28.670
perspective through to kind of our educational processes through to the way we

1617
01:29:28.671 --> 01:29:30.150
are interacting with fighters.
And again,

1618
01:29:30.530 --> 01:29:33.750
we're trying to shape mixed martial arts,
which I know influence the UFC.
That's,

1619
01:29:33.751 --> 01:29:38.670
that's an,
that's our number one mission.
But the,
the,
the global awareness around,

1620
01:29:38.671 --> 01:29:41.370
around the performance institute is,
is,
is really exciting as well.

1621
01:29:41.500 --> 01:29:43.900
<v 0>Now,
I know you guys,
you were talking about your place in China.</v>

1622
01:29:44.090 --> 01:29:45.760
Are you planning on going anywhere else?

1623
01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:49.950
<v 5>Well,
right now,
um,
you know,
the,
the expectation or the,
our,</v>

1624
01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:52.910
our desire is to influence mixed martial arts globally.
We're,

1625
01:29:52.911 --> 01:29:55.280
we're truly a global sport.
So,
um,

1626
01:29:55.281 --> 01:29:57.140
right now we don't know what that's gonna look like,

1627
01:29:57.141 --> 01:30:00.500
but the ambition is to obviously have performance institutes around the world

1628
01:30:00.501 --> 01:30:02.120
that can help the development process.

1629
01:30:02.290 --> 01:30:06.370
<v 2>I want to build one in like South Africa.
Barris over there,</v>

1630
01:30:06.430 --> 01:30:09.490
get the malaria medication ready,
bro.
Wow.
Cipro,
Cipro.

1631
01:30:09.550 --> 01:30:12.250
I don't know what that stuff is.
He just wants to red wine,
right?
Oh,

1632
01:30:12.251 --> 01:30:16.600
it's pretty nice too.
What is cool by is about us operating in athletes,

1633
01:30:16.601 --> 01:30:20.830
being independent contractors and accessing us however they see fit is we have

1634
01:30:20.831 --> 01:30:23.960
so many different case studies in utilization.
Uh,

1635
01:30:24.010 --> 01:30:27.700
we'll have people come out for a week at a time,
access our team,

1636
01:30:27.701 --> 01:30:31.390
take that back wall of other people come out for part of a camp or a full camp.

1637
01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:36.280
Others will come.
We had,
um,
Macy,
Barbara actually,
she talked about it publicly,

1638
01:30:36.281 --> 01:30:38.650
but she,
she worked with us quite a bit for her last fight.

1639
01:30:38.860 --> 01:30:43.860
She booked a flight from Nashville to Vegas to to reconnect to get updated

1640
01:30:44.950 --> 01:30:47.140
nutrition and strength and conditioning,
w whatever,

1641
01:30:47.141 --> 01:30:50.680
whatever metrics that we could update based on her health status as well as

1642
01:30:50.681 --> 01:30:52.220
orthopedic support,
post fight.

1643
01:30:52.570 --> 01:30:57.100
So we were able to get a number of days post fight as part of essentially the

1644
01:30:57.250 --> 01:31:00.610
completion of her fight camp to get her ready for the next phase.

1645
01:31:00.790 --> 01:31:04.330
So there's a lot of different ways that athletes can utilize based on just

1646
01:31:04.331 --> 01:31:07.180
whatever their needs are,
whatever they perceive their needs or needs to be.

1647
01:31:07.450 --> 01:31:11.500
And then whatever influence we're able to kind of make over over their

1648
01:31:11.501 --> 01:31:13.090
preparation.
And Macy,

1649
01:31:13.091 --> 01:31:16.390
Barbara is a perfect example of someone getting that kind of high level

1650
01:31:16.391 --> 01:31:17.800
treatment very early in a career.

1651
01:31:17.801 --> 01:31:22.270
She's only 20 years old to know super exciting prospect and for her to have

1652
01:31:22.271 --> 01:31:24.700
access to the 21 like three weeks,

1653
01:31:24.701 --> 01:31:28.990
she's all there at ey over the hill that that voice is Forrest Griffin.

1654
01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:30.850
Ladies and gentlemen,
no one else.

1655
01:31:31.820 --> 01:31:35.120
<v 0>When you,
um,
when you treat these younger fighters,</v>

1656
01:31:35.150 --> 01:31:39.980
how much emphasis do you put on giving them?
Um,

1657
01:31:40.160 --> 01:31:41.330
just some,

1658
01:31:41.570 --> 01:31:46.570
just a smart protocol to try to minimize the potential injuries to get them to

1659
01:31:46.851 --> 01:31:50.600
understand the relationship between range of motion and injuries to get them to

1660
01:31:50.601 --> 01:31:51.620
understand balance.

1661
01:31:51.650 --> 01:31:54.680
I know you guys have a machine that you actually can measure the muscles in the

1662
01:31:54.681 --> 01:31:57.500
body and show like the left and the right side.
What's,
what's,

1663
01:31:57.560 --> 01:31:59.890
what's weak and what's strong,
right.
What is that called again?

1664
01:32:00.090 --> 01:32:03.470
<v 5>I mean we,
we use false plates in,
in,
in certain particular,
um,</v>

1665
01:32:03.620 --> 01:32:08.420
<v 2>there's something you lie down in though,
isn't there?
So we have the Dexa scan,</v>

1666
01:32:08.421 --> 01:32:11.690
which is essentially a,
you know,
a low dose x Ray.

1667
01:32:11.691 --> 01:32:15.980
The measures the mass of the tissue between bone mass,

1668
01:32:16.010 --> 01:32:20.120
muscle mass and fat mass.
Um,
and so we can get a balance of,

1669
01:32:20.390 --> 01:32:24.920
of the musculature and the skeleton bilaterally when we,

1670
01:32:24.921 --> 01:32:27.460
when we see a big imbalance on that front because that,

1671
01:32:27.461 --> 01:32:29.360
that is a nutrition related test,

1672
01:32:29.570 --> 01:32:32.870
we will share that with both physical therapy and strength and conditioning.

1673
01:32:32.871 --> 01:32:36.350
And then physical therapy could break that into more nuance around strength and

1674
01:32:36.351 --> 01:32:40.160
balances around joints using the biodex and then strength and conditioning.

1675
01:32:40.161 --> 01:32:43.760
We'll do very similar,
uh,
kind of understanding using the,

1676
01:32:43.770 --> 01:32:45.950
the biolateral force plates that Duncan was mentioned.

1677
01:32:45.951 --> 01:32:49.940
Stupid machine told me I had two pounds less muscle in my left leg and my right

1678
01:32:50.270 --> 01:32:52.100
and it was accurate.
Oh yeah.
Now I do.

1679
01:32:52.310 --> 01:32:55.460
I blew up my day out with a couple of times,
but I just didn't rehab it properly.

1680
01:32:56.030 --> 01:32:57.140
So when you found out,

1681
01:32:57.141 --> 01:33:01.250
did you start doing like extra one legged pistols on the left side for two
weeks?

1682
01:33:01.251 --> 01:33:04.810
Maybe even three.
And then I was like,
yeah,
I got some emails,
the sense,

1683
01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:08.870
and now he just keeps running in circles.
Let me ask you this.

1684
01:33:08.871 --> 01:33:11.450
If you did see a fighter and they did have something like that and they were

1685
01:33:11.451 --> 01:33:14.840
active,
they're still competing,
you saw it happens all the time.
What do you do?

1686
01:33:15.260 --> 01:33:15.751
Yeah,
I mean we,

1687
01:33:15.751 --> 01:33:19.130
we have a lot of fighters that have imbalances muscularly that that's,

1688
01:33:19.180 --> 01:33:20.720
that's not a nutrition related.

1689
01:33:22.130 --> 01:33:24.950
Obviously our support is going to be important for the adaptation.

1690
01:33:25.370 --> 01:33:29.680
And this goes to Heather or around a orthopedic assessment,
what are,
what are,

1691
01:33:29.681 --> 01:33:32.030
what's the imbalance?
What's the injury risk?

1692
01:33:32.031 --> 01:33:34.940
Like Dunkin was saying in terms of strength and balances,

1693
01:33:35.710 --> 01:33:38.720
which she and her team had.
Their Linden are,
our director of PT would,

1694
01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:43.430
would do that orthopedic screen,
see what the imbalances are and break it down.

1695
01:33:43.431 --> 01:33:46.280
And then that would lead to probably programming in her space.

1696
01:33:46.281 --> 01:33:50.330
And then also to strength and conditioning to build programs around whether it's

1697
01:33:50.331 --> 01:33:52.220
mobility,
range of motion or,

1698
01:33:52.221 --> 01:33:55.640
or just around kind of hypertrophy to make up for some imbalances.

1699
01:33:55.641 --> 01:33:58.250
So that's where the comprehensive approach comes in.

1700
01:33:58.251 --> 01:34:00.740
I might assess something and then kick it over to them.

1701
01:34:00.920 --> 01:34:03.140
There's many cases where they would assess something,

1702
01:34:03.350 --> 01:34:07.760
whether the strength coach uh,
happened this week.
So and so's having a,
uh,

1703
01:34:07.890 --> 01:34:11.000
a bad training session.
They talk about low energy,

1704
01:34:11.001 --> 01:34:13.940
they talk about not being able to recover and get up for the next training

1705
01:34:13.941 --> 01:34:16.960
session.
That's an immediate referral over to my session to,
to,

1706
01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:20.720
to my side of the fence.
So that's where the integrated care becomes really,

1707
01:34:20.721 --> 01:34:23.180
really critical.
So a how,

1708
01:34:23.210 --> 01:34:26.210
if you had someone that had like a two pound weight difference between their

1709
01:34:26.211 --> 01:34:27.080
left leg and the right leg,

1710
01:34:27.260 --> 01:34:29.150
how much time would you give them to gain that weight back?

1711
01:34:29.151 --> 01:34:32.420
Would it be dependent upon the individual or like you would probably want that

1712
01:34:32.421 --> 01:34:35.210
to be a priority before they went into a heavy camp or something like that.

1713
01:34:35.660 --> 01:34:38.960
You can't resolve that immediately,
but that would be part of the,

1714
01:34:39.090 --> 01:34:42.720
<v 5>I mean it comes back to the return on investment,
right?
Well,</v>

1715
01:34:42.721 --> 01:34:47.580
what's the return on investment to the reduction of an injury risk,
uh,

1716
01:34:47.710 --> 01:34:50.600
to,
to try and influence that two pounds?
Do you know what I mean?
That,

1717
01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:55.050
that's a conversation that's a w w we're going to have that conversation around

1718
01:34:55.051 --> 01:34:58.620
how,
how effective or influential is going to be on the outcome of the fighters.

1719
01:34:58.630 --> 01:35:03.260
So,
you know,
as Glen says,
his fighters at Walt round truly imbalanced.
Um,

1720
01:35:03.290 --> 01:35:06.110
but what's the risk and the time and effort it's going to take to make that

1721
01:35:06.111 --> 01:35:08.990
change?
If it's in a fake count,
we're probably going to just leave it as it is.

1722
01:35:08.991 --> 01:35:11.690
If it's off camp and we've got a little bit more time to try and address it.

1723
01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:15.110
All right now we can be a bit more proactive about your hold.

1724
01:35:15.220 --> 01:35:17.600
We'll take you out back and shoot you.
Now they did a,

1725
01:35:18.110 --> 01:35:20.360
we messed around with some a BFR stuff,

1726
01:35:22.370 --> 01:35:26.420
blood flow restriction can sue type approach.
But again,

1727
01:35:26.490 --> 01:35:28.810
in in physical therapy and strength conditioning,

1728
01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:30.940
that's not revolutionary anymore.
That that's,

1729
01:35:30.980 --> 01:35:33.860
that's part of just another tool that we add to it.
It's,

1730
01:35:33.910 --> 01:35:37.020
it's a way to come to augment,
um,

1731
01:35:37.610 --> 01:35:39.260
or accelerate hypertrophy.

1732
01:35:39.350 --> 01:35:43.220
So if you have someone's coming back for returning from surgery or an injury and

1733
01:35:43.221 --> 01:35:47.630
you're looking to get muscle mass back onto the limb without necessarily loading

1734
01:35:47.631 --> 01:35:49.190
it through free weights or whatever it may be,

1735
01:35:49.460 --> 01:35:53.270
you can use blood flow restriction methods to try and increase the hypertrophy

1736
01:35:53.300 --> 01:35:56.800
mechanism.
What are you thoughts on the electrical muscular stimulation?

1737
01:35:56.810 --> 01:36:01.670
Also pants and sharpies.
Now,
now that it's called Heather,

1738
01:36:02.490 --> 01:36:05.390
they,
they uh,
they come by a lot with different machines.

1739
01:36:05.680 --> 01:36:10.490
So that's an amusing,
I have not,
no,
well,
no,
actually,
no,

1740
01:36:10.491 --> 01:36:15.100
that's not true.
I was the test dominance test done.
Did it help you wrong?

1741
01:36:16.190 --> 01:36:19.460
I think with a lot of those things as some short term relief,
and again,

1742
01:36:19.461 --> 01:36:21.020
you're influenced the nervous system,

1743
01:36:21.260 --> 01:36:25.430
the longterm changes are potentially not there.
Here's our ask you about cupping.

1744
01:36:26.370 --> 01:36:30.550
So it legit.
Yeah.
Is it real Michael Phelps?
I won't see it.

1745
01:36:31.230 --> 01:36:33.440
It's amazing.
Michael Phelps in the Olympics,

1746
01:36:37.570 --> 01:36:40.220
if you think about massage,
that's all decompression.

1747
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:43.610
What [inaudible] does is the opposite.
It lifts.
All right.
So again,

1748
01:36:43.611 --> 01:36:47.360
when we're talking about Fascia and changing faster and I'm releasing faster,

1749
01:36:47.361 --> 01:36:49.970
if all you ever do is massage and depressed the tissue,

1750
01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:52.810
you're not getting that mechanism of lifting and,
and,
and,

1751
01:36:52.811 --> 01:36:56.260
and bringing it up into the cup.
So that,
that's kind of philosophy behind it.
And,

1752
01:36:56.261 --> 01:36:58.400
and our,
our therapists use it a lot,
but again,

1753
01:36:58.401 --> 01:37:02.270
it's just a tool and they're going to use the tool for certain situations.

1754
01:37:02.270 --> 01:37:05.840
And then I leave it for this.
Is there any scientific research to back cupping?

1755
01:37:06.030 --> 01:37:09.950
Not that I'm aware of,
but I might be completely wrong.
So,
um,
do you ever do it?

1756
01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:13.970
I got a couple of showing me like,
show me like,

1757
01:37:14.210 --> 01:37:16.880
what's going on with your leg bro?
Forrest Mars,

1758
01:37:16.910 --> 01:37:21.850
would you do so do you know,
do you know oppression from an,
also,

1759
01:37:21.860 --> 01:37:26.570
you had surgery six weeks ago.
Would you have done MCL,
PCL,

1760
01:37:26.750 --> 01:37:30.820
LCL,
Jesus,
man.
Do you know the single leg?
Uh,

1761
01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:34.790
when you do the scissor defense to the single leg?
I don't.

1762
01:37:35.660 --> 01:37:40.580
Oh No,
not at all.
I just fell right on his leg.
It turns out you can't do a thing.

1763
01:37:41.070 --> 01:37:44.660
Uh,
you can't not do a thing for six years and just think you can do it.

1764
01:37:44.690 --> 01:37:49.680
It's not riding the bike.
It's a,
it's a perishable skill as mere Clinton now,

1765
01:37:49.681 --> 01:37:53.100
now,
so how long ago?
But I have three new ligaments,
so I'm good.
Oh Geez.
Six,

1766
01:37:53.690 --> 01:37:56.010
six and a half weeks or three new ligaments from cadavers.

1767
01:37:56.010 --> 01:38:00.930
<v 3>Is that what it is?
A MCL was able to be repaired down on itself.
PCO,</v>

1768
01:38:00.990 --> 01:38:02.520
cadaver,
Lcl,
cadaver.

1769
01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:07.340
I'm getting world physical therapy on a daily

1770
01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:12.210
cupping today.
I got graston yesterday.
Hurt like hell,

1771
01:38:12.300 --> 01:38:15.220
but literally I'm just Beta testing everything.
I,

1772
01:38:15.420 --> 01:38:17.970
I was the test subject for Roman for all the exercise tests.

1773
01:38:18.210 --> 01:38:20.700
Now I'm the test subject for all the PT Rehab.

1774
01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:23.790
What about stem cells or exosomes or anything along those lines?

1775
01:38:24.690 --> 01:38:26.320
We've got our flights to pat them all booked.

1776
01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:31.620
Dr Neil Riordan on standby and I'm sticking with physical therapy at the moment,

1777
01:38:31.621 --> 01:38:32.454
but I,

1778
01:38:33.190 --> 01:38:37.180
<v 0>I honestly don't know that much about the other components,</v>

1779
01:38:37.181 --> 01:38:41.260
but I'm waiting for embryonic stem cells in the u s then I'll do it.

1780
01:38:42.620 --> 01:38:46.930
<v 3>What does that mean?
They're doing a lot of
Achilles.</v>

1781
01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:50.490
I have Tim [inaudible].
Yeah,
he's fantastic.
Yeah,

1782
01:38:50.491 --> 01:38:53.400
they're doing some incredible stuff.
If you're really interested,

1783
01:38:53.401 --> 01:38:58.170
you should talk to a doctor.
Rati Mcgee.
He's also local in Vegas.
Kelly.

1784
01:38:59.540 --> 01:39:02.610
Yeah,
he's amazing.
I did a consult with them.
You sent me,

1785
01:39:02.611 --> 01:39:04.620
you and cc both set mate and he said,
yeah,

1786
01:39:04.690 --> 01:39:07.690
<v 0>uh,
for my shoulder.
And he was like,
yeah,</v>

1787
01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:10.930
there's nothing there for it to attach to.
I'll take your six grand,

1788
01:39:10.931 --> 01:39:12.790
but it probably won't work cause I was like,
whoa.

1789
01:39:12.791 --> 01:39:15.370
I appreciate the character down him.
Yeah,
he's very,

1790
01:39:15.430 --> 01:39:19.170
he's very honest about the potentials.
But your,

1791
01:39:19.350 --> 01:39:23.110
your shoulder's been operated on how many times?
Three.
Yeah,
that's rough.

1792
01:39:23.530 --> 01:39:26.620
Now what are the options when something like that happens?
Can they,

1793
01:39:26.830 --> 01:39:30.100
I know they do shoulder replacements,
but what does that entail?
Yeah,

1794
01:39:30.101 --> 01:39:33.060
I'll probably do that eventually.
And what does that mean?
They just put a,

1795
01:39:33.280 --> 01:39:36.290
a different socket.
What'd they do it about?

1796
01:39:36.291 --> 01:39:39.790
All of the surrounding ligaments and everything?
I don't know.
That's terrifying.

1797
01:39:39.830 --> 01:39:42.270
I think a lot of those are still intact so I'm a,

1798
01:39:42.420 --> 01:39:47.110
the range of motion were improve as long as I go mess around in our PT once or

1799
01:39:47.111 --> 01:39:50.800
twice a week it stays functional.
So when you say mess around,

1800
01:39:50.801 --> 01:39:54.150
like what kind of stuff you're doing?
Some stuff for mobility or suffer?

1801
01:39:54.580 --> 01:39:55.540
Eat doing like clubs.

1802
01:39:55.570 --> 01:39:58.600
Well I like where you're actually like moving through with them,

1803
01:39:58.601 --> 01:40:01.720
like pressing on the muscles and you're actually like lifting the,

1804
01:40:01.820 --> 01:40:05.750
what's that called?
Where you were lifting weights or someone's window,

1805
01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:09.640
you're like,
ah,
I forgot.
I'll think of it in the,
sorry.
No worries.

1806
01:40:09.690 --> 01:40:14.670
<v 3>Physical therapy.
Did you have,
you do a lot of it</v>

1807
01:40:14.710 --> 01:40:19.630
<v 0>band stuff and a lot of shoulder guys get band work?
I,
I do.
Uh,
yeah I do.
Um,</v>

1808
01:40:19.650 --> 01:40:22.750
like as a warmup every day.
Yeah.
Or every,
you know,
every,

1809
01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:26.500
whenever I worked out except for today I just jumped in cold and my clothes.

1810
01:40:26.501 --> 01:40:30.320
See what happens now,
how much,
how much time do you spend,
uh,

1811
01:40:30.321 --> 01:40:34.620
on just sort of educating fighters about having to strengthen up all the,

1812
01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:39.430
the surrounding tissue around knees and shoulders and necks and things along

1813
01:40:39.431 --> 01:40:42.220
those seeds that are commonly your core,
your lower back,

1814
01:40:42.440 --> 01:40:43.200
<v 3>commonly injured.</v>

1815
01:40:43.200 --> 01:40:47.830
She resilience is massive in our sport cause again it's and range resilience,

1816
01:40:47.831 --> 01:40:51.030
right?
With,
with the submission and,
and,
and the,
you know,

1817
01:40:51.070 --> 01:40:54.160
the grappling exercise techniques,
you're taking

1818
01:40:54.370 --> 01:40:57.460
<v 5>a tissue and the tolerance of that tissue to its end range.</v>

1819
01:40:57.461 --> 01:41:01.060
So by being able to train that over time in a progressive fashion,

1820
01:41:01.061 --> 01:41:03.010
of course it's going to have an influence.
And yeah,
we,

1821
01:41:03.011 --> 01:41:06.130
part of our programming is going to approach that for sure.

1822
01:41:06.850 --> 01:41:09.940
Now you guys have been in action now for two years.

1823
01:41:09.970 --> 01:41:14.710
You've had a bunch of different fighters move through and do their camps there.

1824
01:41:14.770 --> 01:41:19.770
We've had a roster of 570 we've had over 430 of the fight is have already been

1825
01:41:20.081 --> 01:41:24.520
through in the first 22 months and we have a retention rate of about 73%.

1826
01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:27.250
So they're either coming back for repeat visits or the getting remote

1827
01:41:27.251 --> 01:41:31.600
programming from ourselves.
Now how much has this changed over the two years?

1828
01:41:31.601 --> 01:41:36.070
How much has have your protocols change?
A programs have changed a lot.
Yeah.

1829
01:41:36.100 --> 01:41:37.660
I mean,
yeah,
a lot.

1830
01:41:37.661 --> 01:41:40.890
We were learning more about the spa at the data is showing is smaller and you

1831
01:41:40.891 --> 01:41:44.350
know,
again,
just the opportunity to speak to more cultures,
more athletes.
Again,

1832
01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:49.210
W W we're servants to the fight community and w where sports scientists,

1833
01:41:49.211 --> 01:41:51.790
therapists,
clinicians,
um,

1834
01:41:51.820 --> 01:41:55.420
the end of the day the Ip sits with the coaches when they may coaches and people

1835
01:41:55.421 --> 01:41:55.931
like forest.

1836
01:41:55.931 --> 01:41:59.470
So just being able to understand how we can collect that information from a

1837
01:41:59.471 --> 01:41:59.861
technical,

1838
01:41:59.861 --> 01:42:03.700
tactical perspective and try and fit it into our philosophy of sports science

1839
01:42:03.701 --> 01:42:05.530
being complimentary to that,
that that's,

1840
01:42:05.590 --> 01:42:09.610
that's evolved all of our processes extensively over the last two years.

1841
01:42:10.030 --> 01:42:13.390
Have you guys ever thought about putting it in these sessions online?
Yeah,

1842
01:42:13.391 --> 01:42:15.280
I mean I,
oh,
the,
shouldn't,

1843
01:42:16.060 --> 01:42:19.750
I always say the performance institutes got three responsibilities.

1844
01:42:20.270 --> 01:42:23.090
The first responsibility is to serve as athletes to serve.

1845
01:42:23.091 --> 01:42:26.020
It's our fake community,
either face to face or remotely.

1846
01:42:26.290 --> 01:42:29.680
The second thing which we're trying to do something like this is to aggregate

1847
01:42:29.681 --> 01:42:32.440
more information and more insights around the sport.
It's only,

1848
01:42:32.441 --> 01:42:34.330
it's available and when you could buy this now,

1849
01:42:34.331 --> 01:42:38.990
but you can get it online through a,
you know,
it was sent to every,
on our,

1850
01:42:39.170 --> 01:42:40.870
on the average person,

1851
01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:45.040
you can go to our Twitter accounts and things like that and find on there,

1852
01:42:45.041 --> 01:42:48.600
there's links out there on social media.
Everybody knows a UFC fighter,
right?

1853
01:42:48.601 --> 01:42:50.720
Just go fine or borrow.
But,

1854
01:42:51.130 --> 01:42:53.770
but the second thing is we need to understand the sport,

1855
01:42:53.771 --> 01:42:56.590
the sport of mixed martial arts.
He's only 25 years old professionally.

1856
01:42:56.591 --> 01:42:58.480
So aggregating data is a second thing.

1857
01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:00.460
And then the third thing off the back of that,

1858
01:43:00.490 --> 01:43:04.900
that that data is dissemination and education across the global fight community.

1859
01:43:04.901 --> 01:43:08.020
So we were called the performance institute for a reason,

1860
01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:12.190
not the performance gym because we are truly trying to do project work,

1861
01:43:12.191 --> 01:43:13.180
do research work,

1862
01:43:13.181 --> 01:43:16.240
work with partners to try and aggregate that information and uh,

1863
01:43:16.380 --> 01:43:18.910
our awareness and our understanding so that we can push out there.

1864
01:43:19.090 --> 01:43:22.570
So the plan is obviously moving forward to really ramp up our educational

1865
01:43:22.571 --> 01:43:24.670
platforms to support the global community.

1866
01:43:24.910 --> 01:43:28.780
And hopefully we will have kind of certifications coming online and those types

1867
01:43:28.781 --> 01:43:29.860
of things as well.
Strength,

1868
01:43:29.910 --> 01:43:33.910
the amputee or filming stuff to put online to Russia.

1869
01:43:34.480 --> 01:43:38.110
This is the way this exercise properly done,
this things to look out for,

1870
01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:41.270
for physical therapy and a strength and ambition.
You know,

1871
01:43:41.410 --> 01:43:46.020
you guys have a youtube channel.
We don't,
we're,
we know what,

1872
01:43:46.690 --> 01:43:50.080
here's the thing,
we,
we don't want to act quickly.
This isn't,

1873
01:43:50.140 --> 01:43:52.040
we're not like a youtube thing.
We

1874
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:55.410
<v 3>want to lie Tate,
when we released something,
we stand behind it.
This is,</v>

1875
01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:59.240
this is tried and true.
These are practice method.
We don't need to rush it.
Also,

1876
01:43:59.241 --> 01:44:02.530
these jerks are all always busy like working with assholes,
athletes,

1877
01:44:05.430 --> 01:44:07.820
Freud slip.
Well,

1878
01:44:07.821 --> 01:44:11.030
I think that would mean what you guys are doing is amazing and it would be even

1879
01:44:11.031 --> 01:44:14.720
more amazing if young fighters,
people coming up to get it right.

1880
01:44:14.750 --> 01:44:18.530
You really could influence a lot of folks.
It's in our ambition.

1881
01:44:18.531 --> 01:44:22.160
It's just what just to he is into this I first year was just,
shit,

1882
01:44:22.161 --> 01:44:24.730
let's just get operational.
We don't even know what this thing is.

1883
01:44:24.740 --> 01:44:27.620
Is anyone gonna cut mandate to the UFC?
Give you,
I mean,
how much,

1884
01:44:27.770 --> 01:44:30.640
what did they say?
Hey man,
make a fucking awesome place.
Who peekaboo.

1885
01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:33.260
Do their best.
All right,
this is Dana.
Hi Five.

1886
01:44:33.261 --> 01:44:36.350
I'm going back to work like how does that work?
How does,
how does it get set up?

1887
01:44:37.300 --> 01:44:41.940
It was like,
hey,
we want insights into the athletes.
We want,
you know,
event.

1888
01:44:42.150 --> 01:44:44.270
Uh,
it's origin was like,
Hey,

1889
01:44:44.271 --> 01:44:48.110
can you guys make people stop missing weight and getting injured so much?

1890
01:44:48.140 --> 01:44:51.170
And more importantly,
when somebody does get injured,

1891
01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:52.880
can we like get them back quicker?

1892
01:44:52.881 --> 01:44:57.200
Can they not work with like a mom and pop car accident chiropractor to get like

1893
01:44:57.201 --> 01:45:01.670
a professional app?
You know,
can we get them back?
So the,
the the goal,
right?

1894
01:45:01.671 --> 01:45:05.150
So the mission statement is,
you know,
so long gay careers too,
you know,

1895
01:45:05.151 --> 01:45:09.680
to help athletes make the weight class stay within the way class fight gray that

1896
01:45:09.681 --> 01:45:12.140
their weight class.
So again,
uh,

1897
01:45:12.170 --> 01:45:16.410
specific mandates like the exact Kpis,
I forget what they are.

1898
01:45:16.500 --> 01:45:17.930
There were some,
just off the bat,

1899
01:45:19.040 --> 01:45:24.040
what I would say is that we can legitimately say in the first 19 months of first

1900
01:45:24.681 --> 01:45:26.030
19 months of our existence,

1901
01:45:26.150 --> 01:45:31.070
we've saved 22 fights either through medical intervention or the work that

1902
01:45:31.071 --> 01:45:34.220
Clinton has done around someone that's behind the desk,
that white descent.

1903
01:45:34.220 --> 01:45:36.110
And we've really expedited that process.

1904
01:45:36.111 --> 01:45:40.730
So it's amazing that we're proud of that number and it's hard to build KPIs

1905
01:45:40.731 --> 01:45:44.870
around that.
But that's why the performance institute was implemented.
KPAS Kpis,

1906
01:45:44.871 --> 01:45:47.480
key performance indicators.
So when not a fight team,
right,

1907
01:45:47.481 --> 01:45:50.720
we work with the whole roster.
So now what,
we're not judged on wins and losses,

1908
01:45:50.740 --> 01:45:52.330
although some,
some would,

1909
01:45:52.410 --> 01:45:56.030
you would look on social media and some would think and but what,
what,

1910
01:45:56.060 --> 01:46:00.380
what our KPIs are around things like how can we support fights is make weights.

1911
01:46:00.381 --> 01:46:03.140
How can we get them to the door?
They ought to get in a healthy fashion.

1912
01:46:03.470 --> 01:46:05.180
And again,
22 fights.

1913
01:46:05.181 --> 01:46:08.450
We can absolutely say they probably wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for the

1914
01:46:08.451 --> 01:46:10.220
work of the performance institute.
So there's,

1915
01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:13.940
you can put a financial cost potentially against that and that that's kind of

1916
01:46:13.941 --> 01:46:17.420
the philosophy behind the performance institute.
Are Gentlemen,
any last words?

1917
01:46:17.421 --> 01:46:18.320
Clint,
you're gonna say something.

1918
01:46:19.280 --> 01:46:21.980
I was just going to add that that a lot of what we're doing in the,

1919
01:46:21.981 --> 01:46:26.981
in the athletes that we get to interact with are the cases that require huge

1920
01:46:28.101 --> 01:46:30.890
interventions.
You know,
people that are coming off of sixth fight,

1921
01:46:30.891 --> 01:46:35.891
win win streak or not looking for how to fix their metabolism or how to stop

1922
01:46:36.141 --> 01:46:38.570
missing weight or how to improve their power.

1923
01:46:38.990 --> 01:46:42.430
Because it's a deficiency or an orthopedic injury.
So we're,
we're,

1924
01:46:42.431 --> 01:46:46.040
we're working with those that are really successful and those that are

1925
01:46:46.041 --> 01:46:50.410
struggling and everything in between.
So it's around those,
those,
um,

1926
01:46:50.550 --> 01:46:53.810
<v 1>interventions that have led to fights actually happening there.</v>

1927
01:46:53.811 --> 01:46:55.940
There's a huge amount of,
um,

1928
01:46:56.820 --> 01:47:01.120
I guess risk for lack of a better term that were taken on as we're,
as we're,

1929
01:47:01.121 --> 01:47:05.130
we're really working with the athletes best interest at heart and doing

1930
01:47:05.131 --> 01:47:08.640
everything we can to support that athlete to be more consistent and to be able

1931
01:47:08.641 --> 01:47:11.770
to do at longer under their career,
uh,
so that they could,
you know,

1932
01:47:11.820 --> 01:47:16.290
do the best for,
for themselves,
for their family and for,
uh,
I guess the UFC.

1933
01:47:16.590 --> 01:47:21.420
Beautiful.
Anything Dunkin to add to that?
This is a trip,
you know,

1934
01:47:21.421 --> 01:47:23.910
in terms of where we're at with the performance institute,

1935
01:47:24.260 --> 01:47:27.600
our ambition is to really affect and support the global fight community.

1936
01:47:27.630 --> 01:47:30.840
That's what we're about.
And hopefully,
you know,
moving forward to see you w w w,

1937
01:47:30.841 --> 01:47:33.210
w you know,
people are going to see the value of what we're trying to do.

1938
01:47:33.390 --> 01:47:35.340
<v 0>Well,
I think they already see the value.
I certainly do.</v>

1939
01:47:35.341 --> 01:47:38.790
I'm very excited that you guys are around and what you do with the money.

1940
01:47:38.791 --> 01:47:41.940
I thought it's definitely going to be a waste of money and a good way.

1941
01:47:42.260 --> 01:47:44.070
What does that mean though?
Right?
We cost money,

1942
01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:47.900
but I think ultimately it's great for the sport for sure.
And uh,
I,
it's,

1943
01:47:47.901 --> 01:47:50.430
it's just an amazing resource and I'm glad you're a part of it too.

1944
01:47:50.431 --> 01:47:51.510
Me Really means a lot.

1945
01:47:51.900 --> 01:47:55.230
It means a lot to have a guy who's a former champion who's been there.
I mean,

1946
01:47:55.231 --> 01:47:59.040
since ultimate fighter season one,
you know,
I mean,
it's creamy.
Your fight.

1947
01:47:59.070 --> 01:48:03.990
I mean everybody says it.
It's a fact.
Your fight
at least once a day,

1948
01:48:04.020 --> 01:48:08.060
that fucking fight made the sport that you are in.
He was in a fight once.

1949
01:48:09.000 --> 01:48:13.470
Dad Five made the sport man really debt that,
that fight was so crazy.

1950
01:48:13.650 --> 01:48:17.010
People were calling up their friends like when they start doing the Nielsen

1951
01:48:17.011 --> 01:48:18.480
numbers are all shenanigans,
right?

1952
01:48:18.510 --> 01:48:20.490
You get like a hundred people there checking their,

1953
01:48:20.670 --> 01:48:22.690
they don't really know who the fuck's watch watching want,

1954
01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:25.770
but they know that something crazy happened to her in that fight.

1955
01:48:25.771 --> 01:48:30.771
And they'd have estimates that there was as much as 6 million people changed and

1956
01:48:31.111 --> 01:48:33.120
sort of tuning into that fight while it was happening.

1957
01:48:33.180 --> 01:48:35.580
They don't know what the real numbers are,
but it was chaos.

1958
01:48:35.970 --> 01:48:38.460
And then afterwards I never saw anything like it.

1959
01:48:38.850 --> 01:48:43.320
I've seen it was like all the sudden people wanted to watch the UFC.

1960
01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:44.850
It was almost instantaneous.

1961
01:48:45.090 --> 01:48:47.970
The season finale of the ultimate fighter went on the air and then they'll hold

1962
01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:51.960
the door open and people started pouring through.
It was crazy,
man.

1963
01:48:52.430 --> 01:48:55.050
And that's you,
you and Stephan Bonner,
you,

1964
01:48:55.051 --> 01:49:00.051
you guys were responsible for literally the birth of this explosion that you

1965
01:49:00.511 --> 01:49:00.600
are,

1966
01:49:00.600 --> 01:49:03.690
we're all seeing right now that we're seeing with this ESPN deal we're seeing

1967
01:49:03.691 --> 01:49:08.520
with these incredible fights.
No,
it's cool.
And,
and I,
you know,

1968
01:49:08.610 --> 01:49:13.260
I love that,
that I,
that to kind of be back that cornerstone,
but you know,

1969
01:49:13.290 --> 01:49:17.070
now the Pii,
the UFC itself,
the stars today,
it's only built,
you know,

1970
01:49:17.071 --> 01:49:21.090
that was the beginning.
There's,
you know,
there's so much more calm,

1971
01:49:21.270 --> 01:49:23.950
there's so much more to come,
but you're a bad mother.
Fucker.

1972
01:49:23.960 --> 01:49:28.690
Forest were there just,
just thrown.
Ever drill a Jujitsu Orion.

1973
01:49:29.610 --> 01:49:33.650
We were just a lump people.
But seriously,
I mean,
uh,

1974
01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.460
I'm super happy that you guys exist.
It's awesome for me.

1975
01:49:36.590 --> 01:49:39.540
It's been a treat for me as a fan for having a workout with you.

1976
01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:43.110
Learn all the inside stuff.
It's very exciting.
So thank you.

1977
01:49:43.170 --> 01:49:45.660
Much continued success.
Gentlemen,
please come visit as again.

1978
01:49:45.690 --> 01:49:48.200
I would look them anytime.
Thank you very much.
All right.
