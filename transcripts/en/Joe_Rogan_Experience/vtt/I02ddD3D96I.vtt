1
00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.850
This episode of the Joe Rogan experience is brought to you by Lumosity.

2
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.730
We have a new website,
they can go to a new direction,

3
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.470
lumosity.com forward slash Joe and uh,

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.900
if you go to Lumosity they'll explain everything.

5
00:00:15.901 --> 00:00:19.860
But what it basically is is like a gym for your brain with the Mosty is,

6
00:00:19.861 --> 00:00:24.600
is a bunch of cool games that are designed to enhance your focus,

7
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.640
enhance your memory and you can custom tutor them for your tutor.
Custom tutor,

8
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.540
custom tabulate,
what's the word I'm looking for?
Wow.
I've been sick all week.

9
00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:36.600
Ladies and gentlemen.
I got the flu when I gave out all that blood.

10
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.530
I'll talk to Dave Asprey about it.
I give out about a quarter blood.
Nice.

11
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.820
I was thinking maybe it was like a your immune system up or so.

12
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.650
Oh it definitely did.
I was sick and I gave out all that blood and then boom,

13
00:00:46.651 --> 00:00:49.060
it hit me.
Um,
anyway.
Well the Masi is,

14
00:00:49.061 --> 00:00:54.061
is a website that's designed around the concept of neuroplasticity and all of

15
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.620
the,
all the different objectives that you want to achieve.

16
00:00:58.621 --> 00:01:01.960
Like there's like the memory,
they have it,

17
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.470
you can tailor it specifically.
That was the word I'm looking for,

18
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.800
like recalling the location of objects,

19
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.790
remembering the names after the first introductions,
which I fucking suck at.

20
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.390
Learning new subjects quickly and accurately and then once you fill all those

21
00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:17.280
out,
then you move into a tension.

22
00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:19.950
There's a bunch of different options for attention and things like maintaining

23
00:01:19.951 --> 00:01:22.650
focus on important tasks,
improving productivity,

24
00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.480
concentrating while you're learning something new.

25
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.400
All these things they believe they can actually improve upon and and design it

26
00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.400
based on your needs.
Whatever you're looking for,

27
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.750
things that you wouldn't even think about.

28
00:01:33.751 --> 00:01:36.960
Like there's a whole area called flexibility.

29
00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.240
I never would've thought about that as far as like thinking,

30
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.910
but it's actually pretty important if you really stop and think about it,

31
00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.590
like flexibility is is kind of important to,
it's not,
you can't just be smart,

32
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.130
you can't just be crisp.

33
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.690
You have to kind of be able to go with the flow on things and that is a,

34
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.430
that's something that you can work on using Lumosity software,

35
00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.940
communicating clearly,
thinking outside the box,
avoiding errors.

36
00:01:59.941 --> 00:02:04.290
It's a fascinating idea because I know for sure that there are certain things,

37
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:07.830
whether it's podcasting or standup comedy or,
or common telling,

38
00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.270
commentating on fights.

39
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.230
I really honestly believe that when I take time off of those things and I'm not

40
00:02:13.231 --> 00:02:15.690
doing them for a while,
it's almost like it gets lax,

41
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.460
like my ability to perform those tasks.
It just,

42
00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.550
it atrophies just like your muscles do when you don't go to a gym.

43
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.180
So go to lumosity.com forward slash Joe and checkout what their website is,

44
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.520
check out the way they've got it set up.
It's really fascinating.
It's fun.

45
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.020
They're all games that you could play as opposed to just like sitting around

46
00:02:37.021 --> 00:02:41.490
just doing math problems.
This is actually,
it makes it very interesting.
Um,

47
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.300
I've been playing the games with lumosity.com for a few weeks and they're fun

48
00:02:45.301 --> 00:02:49.420
and they're quick and I see some sort of a difference in my ability.
I,

49
00:02:49.421 --> 00:02:53.280
I'm definitely seen a difference in my ability to,
to,
to perform those games.

50
00:02:53.281 --> 00:02:58.020
But I think that that's,
I think if you focus on stuff,
you see a difference.

51
00:02:58.021 --> 00:02:59.750
I mean it's,
it's not magic.
It's,

52
00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.610
it's one of those things where it gives you an opportunity to work out your

53
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:06.550
brain.
Just like a Jim gives you an opportunity to work out your body.

54
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.030
So check out this special offer lumosity.com/joe and click on the start training

82
00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.890
<v 1>Tang mobile and Dave Asprey actually listened to us and got himself asleep.</v>

83
00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.800
Tang phone.
What'd you get?
Which models yet?

84
00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.770
I got the new Samsung s four Oh,
you got that one?

85
00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.860
I got the galaxy note three.
See,

86
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.420
I wish I'd thought of that one because that one seems cooler.
It's bigger.

87
00:05:06.421 --> 00:05:09.810
I've got phone.
It might be too big because yours is pretty big.
You know,

88
00:05:09.811 --> 00:05:13.200
it's not,
here's an small,
the uh,
the s four,

89
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.090
that's probably like the right size.
This is,
I'm,
I'm being a glutton.
Yeah,

90
00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.450
it's a legitimate phone and the service is $100 a month cheaper than my old

91
00:05:21.451 --> 00:05:24.930
eight t.
And.
T like.
Yeah,
it really is.
It's like so cheap purchase.

92
00:05:24.931 --> 00:05:28.060
It's ridiculous.
The cheaper,
well,
Tim has been,
uh,

93
00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.170
<v 0>the results that we've gotten from Tang,
they've been probably our most,</v>

94
00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:37.430
uh,
most like universally applauded company.

95
00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.450
Like everybody who's used it said,
it's fantastic.
These are sprint backbone.

96
00:05:41.451 --> 00:05:44.600
If you like.
Sperling Diaz been using sprint forever.
Joey uses it.

97
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:49.700
He loves it and they,
it's not like,
you know,
they use some Mickey mouse network.

98
00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:52.670
It's an excellent network and what they're doing is they just basically rent

99
00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:56.360
space and then use their own rules and their rules are better.

100
00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:01.130
But what trying to do is set it up so that you can cancel anytime you want.

101
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.860
They have the best android phones that you could buy,

102
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.230
like the sound and like would Brian showed up there.

103
00:06:06.231 --> 00:06:10.700
The Samsung Galaxy note three,
which is what I have or the galaxy s four,

104
00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:13.760
which is what Dave has.
They have all sorts of other phones too though.

105
00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:18.410
All high end android phones,
which uh,
I use fulltime though.

106
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.590
I gave up on the iPhone and fucking the little screen go suck it.

107
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:25.250
Even if they even have used iPhone or used phones on tanks.

108
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.100
So if you want to just,
you know,
like a cheap,
like they said,

109
00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:32.660
here's a phone or $123.
It's an HTC evo four g so yeah,

110
00:06:32.661 --> 00:06:33.740
they have some other ones too.

111
00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:38.150
Like they even didn't sell like flip phones and Goofy Shit.
Uh,
no contracts,

112
00:06:38.151 --> 00:06:41.900
that's their big thing.
They want to make sure that you can buy a phone,

113
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.300
have your service with Tang,

114
00:06:44.301 --> 00:06:47.000
and then if you decide tomorrow you don't want to do it anymore.
That's it.

115
00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:50.720
You've just done no overage charges or penalties.

116
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.250
Like most cell phone companies charge you if you go over your allocated minutes,

117
00:06:55.251 --> 00:06:58.760
text data,
all that stuff.
But if you have a heavier month with Ting,

118
00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.470
you just pay for what you used it.
They,
they,
they make it as fair as possible,

119
00:07:03.471 --> 00:07:06.050
including they,
if you spend,

120
00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:10.220
like if you have one level of service but you go below that,

121
00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.460
they knock you down to the lower level and credit you on your next bill.

122
00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:17.630
It's a really cool company.
Ting will break you,
rates,

123
00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:20.990
break your rates out by minutes,
text messages,
megabytes,

124
00:07:20.991 --> 00:07:24.200
and they'll bill you at the end of the month for what you've used.

125
00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:28.550
It's a sweet company.
It's,
it's very ethical and,
and again,

126
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:33.410
the service is still excellent.
You can get all these things and still have,

127
00:07:33.730 --> 00:07:38.150
you know,
a sprint network behind you.
My Bill,
here's my bill right now,
23 days.

128
00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:42.920
My total is $25.
Yeah.
It's pretty sweet.

129
00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:47.320
The Ma and the,
the reality of most people,
what you're using and what you,
uh,

130
00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.340
you know,
like what minutes,

131
00:07:49.341 --> 00:07:52.220
like how many minutes there are per month and most people don't even call

132
00:07:52.221 --> 00:07:56.120
anybody anymore and you're always on Wifi.
Yeah.
There's a lot of that.

133
00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:59.990
No bundling or ride along services and uh,

134
00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:04.940
you can check it out on,
on the team website.
They're pretty,

135
00:08:04.941 --> 00:08:06.380
uh,
it's pretty good.

136
00:08:06.381 --> 00:08:10.460
At how they've got it all structured so you could figure out what you would
save.

137
00:08:10.461 --> 00:08:14.300
But if you go to rogan.ting.com it's actually kind of interesting.

138
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:16.400
They've got it set up where the,

139
00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.370
they'll show you all their different websites,

140
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:23.420
all the different phones that are still on their website.
What it's not.

141
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:28.310
It says it's not Joe,
is it Rogan?
This was cute.
Confusing me right now.

142
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:29.890
What's our,
uh,

143
00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:34.890
did they give me the wrong one where you said rogan.ting.com rogan.ting.com what

144
00:08:35.031 --> 00:08:36.380
did I do?
Did I tried to do Joe?

145
00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:40.910
I really have too many of these fucking things go over this over and over again.

146
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.510
I wish everybody could have the same like code.
Just do both.
Yeah.

147
00:08:44.540 --> 00:08:47.080
rogan.ting.com is the actual website.
You know,
you should have,

148
00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:51.380
you should have a portal and it's just a website that shows all your sponsors so

149
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:54.380
that they could just go to that one page and see all your sponsors,

150
00:08:54.381 --> 00:08:56.590
all your codes,
all your links.
You know what I mean?

151
00:08:56.591 --> 00:08:59.550
You're not going want me to make it for you?
Uh,
yes,
it's probably a good idea.

152
00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:03.190
All right.
98% of people would save money with Tang.
Um,

153
00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.440
if you look at their website,

154
00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:09.560
it shows $21 is the average monthly bill per device for tin customers.

155
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:11.700
That's just the,
that's delicious.

156
00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.750
440 bucks is the average annual savings per device.
And again,

157
00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:19.770
you don't lose anything.
You still get awesome android phones and HTC one,

158
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:24.600
they have,
uh,
like I said,
the full range of galaxy phones.
They also,

159
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:28.190
if you join their Facebook page,
they have like specials on there and they're,

160
00:09:28.191 --> 00:09:30.510
they're Beta testing the iPhone right now on it.

161
00:09:30.510 --> 00:09:34.410
So I think the iPhone four and four s is what they're starting off at.

162
00:09:34.411 --> 00:09:36.420
But you can get a cheap iPhone.
Get it on.
Tim,

163
00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:39.380
how about the iPhone can go suck it.
How about that?

164
00:09:39.381 --> 00:09:41.700
When I'm done with you and you scrawny screen,
I've been,

165
00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.970
I've been Chinsey with me for too long.
It was Ciencias safe on the sanctions.

166
00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:49.590
That's not,
that's not racist in any way.
Right?
It doesn't indicate,

167
00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:52.010
indicate means cheap.
I don't think I know,

168
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.350
but it seems like one you might get in trouble with and not realize.

169
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.290
And then the Chincy people like come after you.

170
00:09:58.291 --> 00:10:02.640
Like we're from the country of Chincy.
You know what I mean?
There's like chips.

171
00:10:02.641 --> 00:10:06.480
Like you can't say somebody gypped me because Gypsies will get pissed off.

172
00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:10.590
You used to say that all the time.
Oh,
I got chipped.
You can't say that.
You know,

173
00:10:10.591 --> 00:10:13.710
you can't say Jew down.
You can't say he Jude me down in the money.

174
00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:17.430
You cannot say that even though it's like a smart thing to do,
to be like,

175
00:10:17.431 --> 00:10:19.570
you know,
frugal and you know,
you know,
highlight,

176
00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:24.360
didn't know that Jude was a bad word and my boss was Jewish and I was like,

177
00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.520
oh that,
that customer is mad because I Jude.
Um,

178
00:10:26.521 --> 00:10:29.340
or that she thought it Jude them and he goes,
did you just say judo?

179
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.720
I'm Jewish bro.
And like I didn't even know what a Jew was.
Cause I know Ohio,

180
00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:37.200
you only had white.
You might be the dumbest guy that's ever lived seriously.

181
00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:41.120
Like there's not in like in Columbus we w I remember the first time we saw

182
00:10:41.130 --> 00:10:42.930
Mexican,
we were like,
what are those guys?

183
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:47.670
And I'm Mexicans had been in Ohio for a long time now they got their Jamie's

184
00:10:47.671 --> 00:10:52.640
disagreeing with you.
And he's also from Ohio also young.
I'm 40.
Yeah,

185
00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:56.460
it doesn't matter.
I think it's your brain.
I think you need to go to a doctor.

186
00:10:56.461 --> 00:10:59.220
Dave is going to help you.
Let me talk about that on the podcast.

187
00:10:59.221 --> 00:11:02.700
Just something easy like Avocados or something.

188
00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.800
you're missing out on something.

So rogan.ting.com we are also brought to you by on at.com.

192
00:11:16.201 --> 00:11:19.970
That's o n N.
I t.
A lot of new shit at Onnit,

193
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:21.930
including the Zombie kettle bells.

194
00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:26.380
They're the coolest fucking things we've ever sold as far as those,
um,
uh,

195
00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.730
primal bells.
Uh,
this is the newest,

196
00:11:29.731 --> 00:11:33.500
the latest incarnation carnation.
Uh,

197
00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:38.150
they're all done by this guy,
Steven Shubin junior who is a,
a,

198
00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:42.210
an artist.
He's really done an amazing job both with the primal bells,

199
00:11:42.211 --> 00:11:46.200
the different apes,
and with these new Zombie kettlebells,
they're really bad ass.

200
00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:50.850
They're all three d mapped out so that they are balanced.

201
00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.380
If you could,
you could make a cool kettle bell,

202
00:11:53.381 --> 00:11:58.210
but if it wasn't balanced correctly where you use it,
you know it,
it's 50,

203
00:11:58.211 --> 00:12:00.580
50 weight distribution the way it's designed.
If it's not,

204
00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:04.690
it's going to fuck up your workouts.
You gotta be careful about that.
Um,

205
00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:08.020
and also be careful about technique if you're thinking about doing this.

206
00:12:08.021 --> 00:12:10.840
And I've talked to a lot of people that have done it since we started doing this

207
00:12:10.841 --> 00:12:12.760
podcast and I'm super happy about that.

208
00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.870
If you get on some sort of an exercise and strength and conditioning program,

209
00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:21.280
one thing that's huge is you got to learn what you're doing,

210
00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:25.630
whether it's from a video or hiring a trainer or having a friend who really

211
00:12:25.631 --> 00:12:28.630
knows what they're doing,
show it to you.
But concentrate on form.

212
00:12:28.631 --> 00:12:31.300
It's so important because if you use proper form,

213
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:34.390
you can get by with all a lot without getting injured.

214
00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:39.190
But if you don't use proper form,
you're going to get hurt.
If you fuck up.

215
00:12:39.191 --> 00:12:42.400
If you,
you,
you're imbalanced the way you lift weights,

216
00:12:42.401 --> 00:12:43.660
if you're doing it improperly,

217
00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:47.800
these Russian dudes have figured out how to do these things for hundreds of

218
00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.200
years.
They've been swinging these fuckers around,
they got it down,

219
00:12:50.230 --> 00:12:51.910
they know it hurts you,
they know it doesn't.

220
00:12:52.210 --> 00:12:56.680
And it's an amazing way to develop full body strength and conditioning.

221
00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:58.600
It's a really,
my favorite of all time.

222
00:12:58.930 --> 00:13:01.220
We also sell a bunch of other shit like that.
Uh,

223
00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:03.790
that also promotes strength and fitness.

224
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:08.800
Things like battle ropes and steel maces and clubs and all these different

225
00:13:08.830 --> 00:13:13.270
awkward moving things that involve using your entire body,
including supplements.

226
00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:15.990
We call on it a human optimization website.

227
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.740
And that's probably the best way to design it.

228
00:13:17.741 --> 00:13:19.570
And that's the best way to describe it rather.

229
00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:23.170
And that's why we started carrying the bulletproof coffee line of products as

230
00:13:23.171 --> 00:13:26.590
well because we felt like this is the best shit that we could find online.

231
00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:31.000
The Best Himalayan sea salt,
the best hemp protein powder,
whatever we could find.

232
00:13:31.001 --> 00:13:31.834
If it's good,

233
00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:35.410
we try to sell it and we tried to sell it to you at a reasonable price.

234
00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.420
We tried to also make sure that,

235
00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.870
especially with controversial things like supplements and want them,

236
00:13:40.871 --> 00:13:44.890
no for sure no one is trying to rip you off.
All of our supplements,

237
00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:49.180
there's a 30 day or a 30 pill rather 90 day money back guarantee where you don't

238
00:13:49.181 --> 00:13:52.330
even have to return the product.
Just say it sucks,
it doesn't work and boom,

239
00:13:52.331 --> 00:13:55.000
you get your money back.
It's because no one's trying to rip you off.

240
00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:56.560
We're guaranteeing,

241
00:13:56.590 --> 00:14:00.400
not guaranteeing but banking on the idea that we're just selling you the best

242
00:14:00.401 --> 00:14:02.590
shit we could possibly find.
And if you like it,

243
00:14:02.591 --> 00:14:04.300
you'll just continue to buy it from us.

244
00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:07.480
You're not going to want to rip us off and you can only rip us off once,

245
00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:10.930
you know.
It's like shame,
shame on you.
Shame on me.
That kind of thing.

246
00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:13.150
Fool me once.
Shame on you.
Uh,

247
00:14:13.151 --> 00:14:18.151
so go to [inaudible] dot com and use the codeword Rogan and save yourself 10%

248
00:14:18.551 --> 00:14:21.970
off any and all supplements that Brian just pulled up.
Digest tech,

249
00:14:21.971 --> 00:14:25.420
which is our newest product and really interesting stuff.

250
00:14:25.421 --> 00:14:29.050
Digest tech is something that a lot of people don't consider when they,

251
00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:32.980
when they talk about nutrition and what you take into your body.

252
00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:38.340
The real big one is how much is your body utilizing of,

253
00:14:38.471 --> 00:14:42.610
of these nutrients?
Is it 100%?
Is it 50%?
Is it somewhere in the middle?

254
00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:44.720
What is it?
For a lot of people,
they,

255
00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:49.000
they don't know that digestive enzymes or something that you can buy that

256
00:14:49.001 --> 00:14:53.890
actually can help your body absorb more nutrients.
Um,
it's,

257
00:14:53.891 --> 00:14:58.220
it's a really important thing as far as how much you take into your body.

258
00:14:58.221 --> 00:15:00.020
You know,
you can't,
like,

259
00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:04.310
you can't just eat shit food and pop in a Multivitamin,
right?

260
00:15:04.311 --> 00:15:05.180
It's not going to help.

261
00:15:05.450 --> 00:15:09.200
You need a lot of different things to keep your body working at the optimum and

262
00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.030
until you experience that,

263
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:14.630
until he experienced what it's like to have a really healthy diet in a really

264
00:15:14.631 --> 00:15:18.530
good workout routine and continue it on a long period for a long period of time

265
00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:21.650
and then reap the benefits like,
wow,
my body's moving better.

266
00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:26.480
My brain feels better.
I just feel like and more elevated person.

267
00:15:26.481 --> 00:15:30.920
I feel like I'm optimized.
That's what we're trying to achieve over it on it.

268
00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:35.780
And this digestive enzymes are the latest and greatest of uh,

269
00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:40.730
the things that we are selling.
One of them is the digest tech.

270
00:15:40.731 --> 00:15:45.170
The idea is we're putting like we'd call it professional grade,

271
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.500
natural digestive enzyme,
combinatory pill.

272
00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:53.810
And inside this pill represents the most powerful digestive enzyme combinations

273
00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:55.130
on the market today.

274
00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:59.180
Increasing the natural enzyme levels and the stomach not only helps break down

275
00:15:59.181 --> 00:16:00.170
the food faster,

276
00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:04.700
but ease is bloating and any discomfort associated with eating a large meal.

277
00:16:04.701 --> 00:16:09.500
And I know you fat fucks were out there challenged down.
This'll help.
Okay.

278
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:12.980
Pop in a few digestive enzymes.
It will have for buddy break things down better.

279
00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:15.660
<v 2>Is this like the,
the,
the yogurt or the stuff that,</v>

280
00:16:15.661 --> 00:16:18.120
the life culture that you keep in your,
in your refrigerator,

281
00:16:18.130 --> 00:16:19.520
is that somewhere in the same kind of,

282
00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:20.140
<v 0>well,</v>

283
00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:24.460
that's what you're talking about is acidophilus and Acidophilus is a probiotic

284
00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:26.800
that's uh,
just for healthy skin,

285
00:16:26.801 --> 00:16:31.801
healthy skin flora and for healthy a certain amount of healthy bacteria that you

286
00:16:33.281 --> 00:16:37.120
actually want in your body.
And acidophilus is a really good one with this.

287
00:16:37.121 --> 00:16:41.530
Digestive enzymes are what you normally get in food.
You know,

288
00:16:41.531 --> 00:16:44.590
like one of the issues that a lot of people have with milk,

289
00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:49.680
like the reason why raw milk is so much more easy to digest for most people then

290
00:16:50.231 --> 00:16:53.530
pasteurized and homogenized smoke is because it's still has the digestive

291
00:16:53.531 --> 00:16:57.340
enzymes in it.
They're not broken down by the pasteurization process.

292
00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:01.180
The pasteurization process is great because it allows cities to get milk and

293
00:17:01.181 --> 00:17:03.070
allows people to get nutrition that,
you know,

294
00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:06.940
you're dealing with mass numbers of people food last longer.

295
00:17:06.941 --> 00:17:08.610
It takes a long time to get stuff like in,

296
00:17:08.611 --> 00:17:10.840
in New York City and La and that what have you,

297
00:17:10.841 --> 00:17:15.841
but the reality is you're killing the food in order to do that.

298
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.350
That's the only way you can get milk to last a month.
You're killing it.

299
00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.320
You're killing all the enzymes and killing all the life in the food.

300
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:27.820
When you get milk from a farm,
it doesn't taste anything like that.
Shit.

301
00:17:27.821 --> 00:17:31.480
We buy in stores,
well,
we buy in stores,
tastes like this weird water,

302
00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:35.890
but when you get like when you get a cold glass of milk from a farm that came

303
00:17:35.891 --> 00:17:40.810
out of a cow that morning.
Whoa.
That's the fucking things alive,
man.
And there's,

304
00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:44.050
there's a lot of aspects to food.
There's a lot of,
you know,

305
00:17:44.051 --> 00:17:48.640
aspects that people don't consider.
And a big one is enzymes and a,

306
00:17:48.641 --> 00:17:52.770
if you go to [inaudible] dot com forward slash digest tech,

307
00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:57.420
they'll do a much better job of explaining why you should incorporate digestive

308
00:17:57.421 --> 00:18:01.660
enzymes into your diet.
But I,
I can't recommend them enough.
Hey Joe.

309
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:05.080
Hey Dave.
On the bulletproof diet.
Oh,
you welcome bunker.

310
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:09.660
You started with the first sentence in bullet when you were going to hang in

311
00:18:09.661 --> 00:18:13.320
there for like at least a hour for you.
This is about digest tech,
right?

312
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:17.340
I recommend that people take lie pays because it helps you digest fat and most

313
00:18:17.341 --> 00:18:19.800
people don't get enough fat in,
and that's one of the main ingredients there.

314
00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:22.890
So I'm not trying to plug the Diet,
I'm just saying this is the good stuff.

315
00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:26.760
I really do think people perform better when they take digestive enzymes.

316
00:18:26.761 --> 00:18:29.460
So that's a rock in new product in besides live basis.

317
00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:34.320
Other 14 other powerful digestive aids and you're,
you're gonna love it.

318
00:18:34.350 --> 00:18:39.330
It's fantastic stuff on it.com use the code word Rogan and go fuck yourself.

319
00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.820
All Right,
ladies and gentlemen,
Dave Asprey is here.

320
00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:43.620
We're going to get bulletproof.
We're going to get down.

321
00:18:43.621 --> 00:18:46.740
We're going to get gritty.
We're going to be Kevlar up in this bitch,

322
00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:51.890
<v 3>okay?</v>

323
00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:53.630
<v 0>The Joe Rogan experience.</v>

324
00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:57.500
<v 3>Try my day.
Joe Rogan podcast by night all day</v>

325
00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:05.720
<v 0>spree.
Dave Asprey's here and he's hooked up to a goddamn machine,</v>

326
00:19:05.721 --> 00:19:10.160
already walks in the door showing us his heart rate,
his penis rigidity.

327
00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:12.800
All that.
It's all taken down.
What is that?

328
00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:16.250
Is that I'm an application that you have?
It's,
yeah,
it's called HRV.

329
00:19:16.251 --> 00:19:18.800
Since it's a new,
a new APP here.

330
00:19:18.801 --> 00:19:21.920
It shows you your heart rate and your heart rate variability.

331
00:19:21.921 --> 00:19:25.010
It'll track all day long what your stresses so you can see which meetings like

332
00:19:25.011 --> 00:19:26.390
with your boss or someone,
I don't know.
Oh,

333
00:19:26.391 --> 00:19:29.750
so it tells you like what time it was up and down.
It gives you like a chart.

334
00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.700
Exactly.
Wow.
That's pretty dope.

335
00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:35.420
It also tells you when you're over trained can like get your HRV in the morning

336
00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:38.120
and then you can see if it doesn't change the way it should throughout the day.

337
00:19:38.121 --> 00:19:40.340
You know you're getting too much exercise.
You need to back off,

338
00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:42.950
recover and then hit it hard the next.
That's a big one.

339
00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:45.230
That's a big one that a lot of folks who are not aware of,

340
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:48.950
especially like these dudes that are into crossfit and all that kind of

341
00:19:48.951 --> 00:19:52.910
wackiness.
There's a good thing in that for sure.
There's a good thing.

342
00:19:52.911 --> 00:19:55.460
It we're working really hard and training really hard,

343
00:19:55.461 --> 00:19:58.280
but you've got to give your body a chance to recover,
and if you don't,

344
00:19:58.430 --> 00:20:02.060
you get behind the eight ball and then your body starts to do to digress.

345
00:20:02.090 --> 00:20:05.180
You start to lose.
Conditioning should lose and you can get injured.

346
00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.070
Having so lobby young fighters,

347
00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:11.630
Lotta young fighters overtrain even older fighters.
I mean junior dos Santos,

348
00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:16.000
a overtrained for is Cain Velasquez rematch so much that he got robbed.
Oh,

349
00:20:16.001 --> 00:20:18.680
my analysis,
is that how you say it?
I don't even know that one.

350
00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.660
That's the one that those crossfitter dudes get all the time.
Oh,

351
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:22.810
it's a where you're,

352
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:26.810
your muscle breakdown is actually getting into your bloodstream and it can cause

353
00:20:26.811 --> 00:20:27.770
kidney failure.

354
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:31.820
It's just cause you have smashed your muscles so bad there.

355
00:20:31.821 --> 00:20:36.200
They become like Jello and they're just oozing poison in your fucking

356
00:20:36.201 --> 00:20:39.890
bloodstream.
Oh yeah.
I mean you got to give yourself a chance to recover.

357
00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:40.970
It's you're not a,

358
00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:45.620
it's not a matter of simple matter of will over your body.
It's,

359
00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:47.950
it's will along with science,

360
00:20:47.951 --> 00:20:51.760
like can you push yourself to the 100% potential?

361
00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:53.860
That's most people don't even get there.

362
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:55.690
Most people don't get to the overtraining part.

363
00:20:55.691 --> 00:20:57.970
It's real psychos to get to the overtraining part.

364
00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:01.840
Most people don't even get there,
but the overtraining part,

365
00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:05.800
you something like this,
use a heart rate monitor,
check yourself in the morning,

366
00:21:05.801 --> 00:21:10.390
things along those lines.
It will save so many people,
so much heartache.

367
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:13.810
Especially people listened to this show like those are the people with a lot of

368
00:21:13.811 --> 00:21:17.260
will.
Like they really,
they care about this stuff.
So if you have a lot of wheel,

369
00:21:17.261 --> 00:21:20.830
you're more likely to smash your muscles like that.
That's one of my problems.

370
00:21:20.831 --> 00:21:22.480
Like last time I said I,
I've,

371
00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:25.150
I'm not exercising that much because I'm not recovering.

372
00:21:25.151 --> 00:21:27.220
Like I'm just going at a hundred miles an hour all the time,

373
00:21:27.221 --> 00:21:30.520
sleeping five hours a night.
If I did hit it as hard as I could,

374
00:21:30.521 --> 00:21:34.180
if I lifted heavy three times a week,
it would destroy me.
I would just get sick.

375
00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:36.310
So I have to sleep a lot more if I'm going to lift heavy.

376
00:21:36.311 --> 00:21:38.620
But this APP Kinda tells me when I'm doing that.

377
00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.800
Are you still trying to work out once a month or something wacky like that?

378
00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:45.640
Weren't you doing like 45 minutes a month?
I try to do 15 minutes a week,

379
00:21:45.970 --> 00:21:50.200
15 minutes a week I'm doing like I'm doing okay,
but I think I could do better.

380
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:54.130
Like I'm not exactly,
it's not really a sign of fitness,

381
00:21:54.131 --> 00:21:55.210
so I just want to let you know.

382
00:21:55.211 --> 00:21:59.320
I Dunno what kind of magazines you've read those Charles Atlas things.

383
00:21:59.321 --> 00:22:02.310
Remember those?
He man build a he-man things.
Yeah.

384
00:22:02.830 --> 00:22:05.830
I'm actually working a lot on functional movement right now.

385
00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.610
[inaudible] I have a screw in my right knee and I've had three surgeries on it

386
00:22:09.611 --> 00:22:13.480
before I was 24 I have no ACL in it,
so I stand kind of.

387
00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:17.170
You have no ACL in one.
Neat.
Yeah,
and it took a lot of work,

388
00:22:17.171 --> 00:22:20.680
but I've been able to like climbing the Himalayas and do long distance.

389
00:22:20.681 --> 00:22:22.960
How to track.
It's just get it fixed.
You know,

390
00:22:22.961 --> 00:22:25.840
I looked at it back when it went out and they wanted to put something in from a

391
00:22:25.841 --> 00:22:28.290
cadaver that was good for five years or a synthetic.
No,
no,

392
00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:31.160
it's not good for five years.
It's good forever.
I have one oh two diver,

393
00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:33.810
they told me it was only good for five years.
That's Canadian.

394
00:22:33.811 --> 00:22:37.630
So I don't know any better up there.
They were using dog bones.
Nice.

395
00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:41.230
It's fun shoe laces I might not can need together.

396
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:43.960
I might actually get it fixed cause uh,
to get it fixed.
Trust me,

397
00:22:43.961 --> 00:22:47.380
I've had both of mine.
Does it change things for you?
I'm like,
Oh fuck yeah.

398
00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.360
I had them done two different ways to,

399
00:22:49.361 --> 00:22:53.260
I had my left one done in 1993 and they did it with a Patella tendon graft.

400
00:22:53.261 --> 00:22:55.360
They take a slice off of your Patella,
right?

401
00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.870
Patella 10 is a big fat one in the middle of the front runner and that one's

402
00:22:58.871 --> 00:23:02.680
really strong and you can take a little bit of that off and more than enough for

403
00:23:02.681 --> 00:23:05.830
an ACL when you still don't need the amount of strength that it can.

404
00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:10.510
It possesses.
So,
uh,
they,
they do that and as long as you do the right rehab,

405
00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:10.950
that's,

406
00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:14.680
that's the way George Saint Pierre just went a bunch of other column Mcgregor.

407
00:23:14.681 --> 00:23:17.830
He got the same surgery as well,
the with the Patella tendon graft.

408
00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:22.390
But a lot of guys want to do the less invasive one,
which is with the cadaver.

409
00:23:22.391 --> 00:23:24.970
I had that done in my right knee.
Mind worked great,

410
00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:29.550
but I have heard other guys get the cadaver and then they,

411
00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:30.520
their training,

412
00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:33.910
like they're trying to get back in shape and it blows out on them.
Right.

413
00:23:34.150 --> 00:23:38.230
I have heard that happen because your body just didn't accept it or your body

414
00:23:38.231 --> 00:23:42.310
rejected it.
Dominick Cruz,
in fact,
the UFC bantamweight champion,

415
00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:47.180
he had to get his redone and it was for very reason,
it just popped on them.

416
00:23:47.181 --> 00:23:50.070
Just get any sense of what he was doing was nothing.
It just gave out.

417
00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:55.070
<v 1>Mine gave out.
I'd been lifting heavy six days a week for 18 months.</v>

418
00:23:55.071 --> 00:23:57.350
I was really training hard cause I just never wanted to get hurt again.

419
00:23:57.351 --> 00:24:00.800
I was in my early twenties I was still fat.
I couldn't lose this weight and uh,

420
00:24:00.860 --> 00:24:02.570
I finally said I'm going to go have fun with my friends.

421
00:24:02.571 --> 00:24:06.500
I was playing laser tag when I blew the ACL.
I just like squatted,
twisted,
boom,

422
00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.020
milky way to hurt yourself.
I had the same thing.

423
00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:12.470
I just turned when I was filming something once it fell to the ground screaming

424
00:24:12.471 --> 00:24:14.660
and couldn't walk for like a month.
Exactly.

425
00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:17.930
<v 0>Yeah.
If you don't pivot your feet when you turn around,</v>

426
00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:20.710
you put a lot of stress on that knee,
man.
That's how I blew mine out.

427
00:24:20.711 --> 00:24:24.160
The first time the left one I blew out throwing kick on a bag.

428
00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:28.450
It was just exhausted doing rounds and a bag and I just didn't a kick too hard

429
00:24:28.690 --> 00:24:30.840
to not pivot my name.
It just popped on me.

430
00:24:30.841 --> 00:24:34.600
It just gave out and my right one was doing Jujitsu.

431
00:24:34.660 --> 00:24:37.900
It's someone that was caught between someone's legs and he just extended his

432
00:24:37.901 --> 00:24:42.040
legs like half guard and my leg,
my knee snap like a carrot.

433
00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:46.720
But both of them I had done.
Both of them are great today.
I do everything.

434
00:24:46.721 --> 00:24:50.410
I do more Tai Jiu Jitsu bother me at all.
It doesn't bother me at all.

435
00:24:50.411 --> 00:24:52.300
So they can fix them solid.

436
00:24:52.550 --> 00:24:56.210
The problem with not getting them fixed as they're moving around a lot and it's

437
00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:00.310
causing a lot of undue friction inside on your meniscus and all that jazz,

438
00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:01.870
it's tough.
Can Get chewed up.

439
00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:03.160
<v 1>Uh,
I've,</v>

440
00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:07.780
I've been able to totally control the pain in the knee and the inflammation and

441
00:25:07.781 --> 00:25:09.970
also I feel good all the time.

442
00:25:10.240 --> 00:25:12.930
But because my knees to just pop out menu capitalist,

443
00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:15.370
go sprawling and the leg would fold sideways and I'd fall down,

444
00:25:15.371 --> 00:25:16.230
like over and over,

445
00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:20.650
my nervous system learned that that leg is weak and you should protect it.

446
00:25:20.651 --> 00:25:22.960
So I put all my weight on my left leg unconsciously.

447
00:25:22.961 --> 00:25:24.520
And when I feel like I'm standing straight,

448
00:25:24.521 --> 00:25:27.940
I'm standing crooked and my right shoulder's too far forward in one's higher.

449
00:25:28.090 --> 00:25:32.470
So I'm relearning all these neurological pathways in activating,
you know,

450
00:25:32.471 --> 00:25:33.970
my feet muscles in the right way.

451
00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:37.360
And it's actually a lot of work and it makes like different parts of your body

452
00:25:37.361 --> 00:25:38.860
hurt in ways that aren't normal.

453
00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:42.790
But I think I didn't start out with the strongest physical frame I would have

454
00:25:42.791 --> 00:25:43.624
liked.

455
00:25:43.870 --> 00:25:47.100
<v 0>Yeah.
Without a doubt.
Should get your knees fixed.
All right.</v>

456
00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:50.230
I'm telling you because it's one of those things where,
yeah,
there's,

457
00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:52.990
there's a period where you're gonna have to rehab it six months,

458
00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:56.530
but once it's done,
you'll be so happy.
You'll be like,
ah,

459
00:25:56.531 --> 00:26:00.370
I got a leg legging count on now.
Cause I guarantee you,
you have like one leg,

460
00:26:00.371 --> 00:26:03.020
you really count on it and another one that you're just a little,

461
00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:06.460
a little freaky.
You don't want to jump onto an ice wall with it,
you know.

462
00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:10.300
Exactly.
He went ice climbing.
He wouldn't trust that bitch.
Not in the slightest.

463
00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:14.320
No.
Right?
Yeah.
Get it fixed dude.
All not hard man.
And believe me,

464
00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:17.170
you'll be walking in like no time and look a week.

465
00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:20.830
It'd be walking around the way they can do it today.
It's fucking incredible.

466
00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:24.310
Just fixed that bitch up.
All right,
do it.

467
00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:27.820
I will go see someone Joe on your mouth.
Oh,
I'm all pressuring them.

468
00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.270
I'm going to give into peer pressure and have knee surgery people.

469
00:26:31.271 --> 00:26:33.190
There's certain surgeries that I don't like.

470
00:26:33.191 --> 00:26:37.690
I've seen a lot of people have problems,
uh,
with their backs.

471
00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:39.550
Backs scare the shit out of me.

472
00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:44.910
Like I think a lot of people just like to go right away and get surgery on

473
00:26:45.091 --> 00:26:48.120
things and I think in certain circumstances surgery is the way to go.

474
00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:51.780
Like I know people who've gotten artificial discs and a bunch of different

475
00:26:51.781 --> 00:26:54.960
things and they needed to do it at the time they had like a real serious issue.

476
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:58.380
But I know some other people I go,
man,
I wonder if that guy could have held out,

477
00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:00.000
wonder if you could have lost some weight.

478
00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:02.100
I wonder if he could have tried taking yoga,

479
00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:06.450
tried changing his diet a little bit to reduce inflammation,
cut out your sugars.

480
00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:11.580
Simple sugars.
Like people don't realize,
you know,
I,
I went gluten free,
um,

481
00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:16.680
cheated a little bit the other day,
had some cookies.
No,
no.

482
00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:19.500
You just said you had the flu,
right?
Yeah.
But that wasn't because of that.

483
00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:25.260
He was tossing his cookies.
The flu is because of a,
this regino keen shit.

484
00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:29.610
I'm going through this blood spinning procedure today was actually the first
day,

485
00:27:29.611 --> 00:27:32.140
if you ever heard of that stuff.
Do you know what I'm talking about?
What is that?

486
00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:36.870
It's the wrong God explained this to,
I'm so fucking stupid.
But as with a lot of,

487
00:27:36.871 --> 00:27:38.940
uh,
athletes had been doing the stem cell thing.

488
00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.100
Well it's not necessarily a stem cell thing.

489
00:27:41.101 --> 00:27:44.630
It's your own blood and then your blood gets you,
uh,

490
00:27:44.790 --> 00:27:47.670
put through this process.

491
00:27:48.030 --> 00:27:50.610
I should find the best way to explain it online.

492
00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:55.560
But I flew back from England so it was like an 11 hour flight.
And um,

493
00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:56.761
then,
uh,

494
00:27:56.761 --> 00:27:59.670
I didn't get any sleep the night before cause my clock was all screwed up.

495
00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:03.870
So I stayed up all night and then tried to sleep on the plane and then lifted in

496
00:28:03.871 --> 00:28:08.730
the morning like an asshole and then started to feel kind of sick and then got

497
00:28:08.731 --> 00:28:12.300
this court of blood pulled out of my body.
Oh Man.
It's not really a court.

498
00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:14.610
I don't know what it is.
How many,
it's probably a pint.

499
00:28:14.611 --> 00:28:16.490
That's what I usually take.
When did they put it back in some,

500
00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:19.740
I think it's more than a pint.
It's a lot of God damn blood.

501
00:28:19.741 --> 00:28:23.070
And they culture it for what you may think to something where they introduce it

502
00:28:23.071 --> 00:28:27.300
to he and then they spin it in a centrifuge and they pull out this yellowish

503
00:28:27.301 --> 00:28:28.134
shit.

504
00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:33.140
And this yellowish shit is supposed to be one of the very best drugs for

505
00:28:34.531 --> 00:28:38.910
anti-inflammation.
Known demand is created by your own body.
Sign me up.

506
00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:44.010
Yeah.
I,
uh,
I'm fascinated by it.
You know,
I don't necessarily,

507
00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:47.460
uh,
uh,
no for sure that it's gonna work,

508
00:28:47.461 --> 00:28:50.070
but it's one of those things that all these different athletes,

509
00:28:50.071 --> 00:28:53.940
like Peyton manning had it done on his neck.
Um,
he had,
uh,

510
00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:56.370
two dick different neck surgeries,
I believe,

511
00:28:56.371 --> 00:29:01.180
and he was close to retiring before he had this done.
And,
um,
I know that,
uh,

512
00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:01.990
Chris Weidman,

513
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:04.770
UFC middleweight champion just went over there and had it done on his knee and

514
00:29:04.771 --> 00:29:08.400
he's just raving about it.
Go to London to get it done.
Well,
I'm getting a no,

515
00:29:08.401 --> 00:29:11.330
I went to,
I'm getting mine done in Santa Monica.

516
00:29:11.410 --> 00:29:14.700
They started doing it in Santa Monica now.
Sweet.
Alright.
They um,
the,

517
00:29:14.701 --> 00:29:17.850
the guy learned how to do it from the dude in Germany.

518
00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.340
There's a cat in Germany that figured this out.

519
00:29:20.610 --> 00:29:25.610
Germany's just so far ahead of the United States when it comes to their,

520
00:29:25.651 --> 00:29:27.990
uh,
their experimental medicine.

521
00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:32.010
Everyone in the United States got hamstrung with all that stem cell shit during

522
00:29:32.011 --> 00:29:34.680
the Bush administration where people thought they were just going to start

523
00:29:34.681 --> 00:29:38.490
sucking babies at a chick's pussies and turning them into fucking medicine.

524
00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:43.600
There was a real worry people were going to like actually get abortions on

525
00:29:43.601 --> 00:29:46.780
purpose in order to come to this.
Yeah,
there was,

526
00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:50.880
there was a lot of nuttiness when it came to stem cells and research.
Right?

527
00:29:50.970 --> 00:29:52.020
So we lost a lot.

528
00:29:52.210 --> 00:29:54.460
<v 1>Here's the coolest stem cells story I've ever seen.</v>

529
00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.880
There's this thing you can do for anti aging where you pull your fat cells out

530
00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:02.200
and they do something to them and reinject them as fat stem cells and it can

531
00:30:02.201 --> 00:30:05.500
take like take 20 years off your face and it lasts for a long time.

532
00:30:05.501 --> 00:30:08.920
So a lot of ladies are getting this done and there was a lady in Beverly Hills

533
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:10.390
who got that done the same time.

534
00:30:10.391 --> 00:30:15.391
They injected calcium into her eyelids and because it was a stem cell and it saw

535
00:30:15.761 --> 00:30:18.930
the calcium,
it made bones in her eyelids.
So she click,

536
00:30:19.090 --> 00:30:22.940
she closed her eyes and it would click with bones.
True Story.
Amazing.
So yes,

537
00:30:22.941 --> 00:30:25.420
stem cells are amazing.
I don't think we understand them that well,

538
00:30:25.421 --> 00:30:27.280
but I'm really interested in stimulating mine.

539
00:30:27.281 --> 00:30:29.860
I'm using like electromagnetic fields to do that right now.

540
00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:33.520
<v 0>Yeah,
that seems like students,
stem cells in Europe.</v>

541
00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:37.680
You want to try like generation four or five of that mother fucker.

542
00:30:37.690 --> 00:30:42.690
It's like these poor gals that get their lips done permanently and like get like

543
00:30:43.301 --> 00:30:44.680
crazy facial surgery.

544
00:30:45.070 --> 00:30:47.740
You know there's another thing that they're coming up with in Germany that's

545
00:30:47.741 --> 00:30:52.660
going to make your body restart its production of Collagen.
Sweet.
Yeah.

546
00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:56.440
What you had when you were young and the reason why your face turns all wrinkly

547
00:30:56.441 --> 00:31:00.040
and fucking a lot of that has collagen.
They the same guys.

548
00:31:00.041 --> 00:31:04.660
It's Dr Peter Welling that developed this regino keen.
I'm a therapy.

549
00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:09.030
He's developing something that's going to make your body reproduce Collagen.

550
00:31:09.150 --> 00:31:12.460
They're going to have shit nailed within a hundred years.

551
00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:15.700
No one's ever going to die.
Well,
you had a love for gray on,
right?

552
00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:19.360
I had Aubrey de Grey on my TV show.
Okay.
Never actually made the air.

553
00:31:19.361 --> 00:31:24.160
We goes fucking Philistines,
man.
Tear.
They Edit Abi the grout.
Aubrey's a buddy,

554
00:31:24.161 --> 00:31:26.200
he's,
he's fascinating task.
Love that guy.

555
00:31:26.201 --> 00:31:27.880
But I got to talk to him for about an hour.

556
00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:31.610
<v 1>Did you get hypnotized by his beard?
Yeah.
Sexy as fuck.</v>

557
00:31:32.010 --> 00:31:33.290
I keep looking at him.

558
00:31:33.291 --> 00:31:36.410
He has the coolest beard I've ever seen on a human being and I just try to look

559
00:31:36.411 --> 00:31:39.700
him in the eye and right eye.
Just look at his beard.
So,
hey,
Aubry.
Yeah,

560
00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:44.730
<v 0>great guy.
So this Regina Regina keen stuff,
they take 60 milliliters of blood.</v>

561
00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.670
That seems like a lot.
Wow.
Um,

562
00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:51.330
the blood is then heated and the heating causes the blood to undergo the same

563
00:31:51.331 --> 00:31:55.830
changes.
It would if a person receives a fever and the blood is then put into a

564
00:31:55.831 --> 00:32:00.831
centrifuge and separated and one of the layers of yellowish serum is a layer

565
00:32:01.261 --> 00:32:05.370
full of things.
Great for reducing pain and inflammation.
Cytokines,

566
00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:10.610
cytokines,
cytokines,
k.
E.
N.
E.
S.
Um,

567
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:13.080
it's really interesting shit.

568
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:16.260
I'll let you guys know exactly whether or not it's helping or not helping me,

569
00:32:16.261 --> 00:32:21.030
but I just had the first series of injections stuck into my neck and back this

570
00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:21.560
morning.
There's

571
00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:24.170
<v 1>another German thing they do.
They'll pull your blood out,</v>

572
00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:26.210
they'll mix it with ozone gas,

573
00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:29.840
which causes a whole bunch of anti inflammatory molecules and then they inject

574
00:32:29.841 --> 00:32:31.460
the blood back end after that.

575
00:32:31.461 --> 00:32:35.960
Really strong oxidative exposure and it has not stem cell affects,

576
00:32:35.961 --> 00:32:39.020
but it has really strong anti inflammatory effects.
I've done that one and it's,

577
00:32:39.150 --> 00:32:39.983
it's pretty legit.

578
00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:42.390
<v 0>Well,
according to a lot of these doctors,</v>

579
00:32:42.420 --> 00:32:46.470
inflammation is the cause of a lot of illnesses,

580
00:32:46.471 --> 00:32:51.000
a lot of problems and there's many different factors.
There's diet,

581
00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:54.990
there's certain people have allergies to certain things and are aware of that

582
00:32:54.991 --> 00:32:57.780
cause inflammation.
But diet is a big one.

583
00:32:57.990 --> 00:33:02.490
Having a low inflammatory diet or a low inflammation diet,

584
00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:04.380
it's really good for you and it's good.

585
00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:09.480
We're fucking so hooked on shit that's not good for us.
You know,

586
00:33:09.750 --> 00:33:12.660
like I talked so many people I've talked to about this,
I'm like,

587
00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:16.200
I went gluten free and so many people I talked to about it,
they were like,
well,

588
00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.770
how hard is that hard,
hard is it to do?
My God,
it's gotta be so hard to do.

589
00:33:19.771 --> 00:33:23.340
Like I could never do it.
They just like,
they're just wouldn't.
And I'm like,

590
00:33:23.341 --> 00:33:26.310
I'm telling you,
it's not that hard.
It's really not that big a deal.

591
00:33:26.311 --> 00:33:28.950
You just eat vegetables and meat.
Like everything tastes good,

592
00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:33.690
but it's like you get this idea in your head that you need to have this stuff in

593
00:33:33.691 --> 00:33:36.690
your body all the time.
Bread and sugar and,

594
00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:41.610
but Brad converts directly to sugar.
Even if gluten is,
it's all bullshit.

595
00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:45.450
Like the gluten intolerance is that people have as far as digesting it,

596
00:33:45.451 --> 00:33:46.470
even if that's bullshit,

597
00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:51.060
it's definitely not bullshit that you becoming a person with much more sugar in

598
00:33:51.061 --> 00:33:55.230
their diet.
If you increase the amount of pastas.
And breads eat without a doubt.

599
00:33:55.231 --> 00:33:58.560
When you eat pasta,
when you eat bread,
it converts directly to sugar.

600
00:33:58.710 --> 00:34:01.020
And having sugar in your body causes inflammation.

601
00:34:01.021 --> 00:34:03.780
So gluten without a doubt causes inflammation.

602
00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:06.120
<v 4>There's another thing called agglutination,</v>

603
00:34:06.150 --> 00:34:09.120
which is when your red blood cells stick together so they don't carry nutrients

604
00:34:09.121 --> 00:34:12.390
and oxygen like they should.
And part of gluten is Gliadin,

605
00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:16.530
which is something that we use to cause clotting like it.

606
00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:20.040
It's a clotting factor that's in this grain and it's there as a defense

607
00:34:20.041 --> 00:34:24.070
mechanism to keep animals from eating the grain.
So when people areas as,

608
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:26.400
so what do we do?
We eat it.
Yeah,
we eat it.
And like,
oh,

609
00:34:26.401 --> 00:34:28.510
I wonder why I have autoimmune conditions.

610
00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:33.090
So this is one of the reasons you think that like if that was known that that

611
00:34:33.091 --> 00:34:35.700
would be something that they would just start telling farmers,
hey guys,
guys,

612
00:34:35.701 --> 00:34:39.510
guys stop growing grain.
Like,
well,
look what's going on.
And the farmers would go,

613
00:34:39.540 --> 00:34:44.010
oh,
we didn't even know,
Oh,
it's causing inflammation.
Oh,
sorry.
But no,

614
00:34:44.190 --> 00:34:48.950
it's just like everybody's like,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
I like bread.
There's a,
yeah,

615
00:34:49.410 --> 00:34:52.410
I'm not going to stop eating spaghetti.
That's the gluteomorphin problem.

616
00:34:52.411 --> 00:34:53.700
You know about that.
What's that?

617
00:34:53.730 --> 00:34:56.760
Gluteomorphin is what happens when you partially digest gluten.

618
00:34:56.790 --> 00:35:00.000
It goes through the gut lining and it's called gluteomorphin cause it sounds

619
00:35:00.001 --> 00:35:04.050
like morphine.
It goes to the same opiate receptors that heroin goes to.

620
00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:07.860
There's a reason when you go gluten free you're fine and then you have one Bagel

621
00:35:07.861 --> 00:35:10.140
or croissant and the next day you're like,
I'll just have a little bit.

622
00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:13.350
It's the same.
It's like someone says,
I think I mostly gave up heroin.
Like no,

623
00:35:13.351 --> 00:35:14.150
if you go gluten free,

624
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:17.160
don't have a cheat day once a week cause you'll crave gluten all the time

625
00:35:17.161 --> 00:35:19.630
because of this opiate like effect.
What is it?

626
00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:23.020
<v 0>One thing that I've read and I really like to know,</v>

627
00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:26.650
how long does gluten effect your system?
Like say,

628
00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:29.860
because I've read that it's total bullshit that it goes right through your

629
00:35:29.861 --> 00:35:32.320
system.
Just like everything else.
It's not a healthy thing to eat,

630
00:35:32.530 --> 00:35:35.650
but your body doesn't have most likely,
unless you have CELIAC's disease,

631
00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:38.010
it doesn't have any intolerances towards it.
And then I've

632
00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:41.370
<v 4>met red,
the other that says that it can stay in your system as long as 30 days,</v>

633
00:35:41.371 --> 00:35:44.910
like have a cookie and it'll be in your system for 30 days.
I'm like,

634
00:35:44.911 --> 00:35:47.910
that doesn't even make sense.
The gluten itself won't be in your system,

635
00:35:47.911 --> 00:35:52.050
but the impact of the gluten on your immune reaction can go as long as six

636
00:35:52.051 --> 00:35:54.540
months.
How some people,
well it,

637
00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:58.920
it's kind of like so of Spaghetti fucks you for half a year.
It doesn't fuck you.

638
00:35:58.921 --> 00:36:03.060
It has a declining power over how you feel.
But think about this,

639
00:36:03.061 --> 00:36:06.180
you get one uh,
immune booster,
right?
That's good for a whole year.

640
00:36:06.181 --> 00:36:08.380
It was one exposure.
What's in the immune booster?

641
00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:10.830
Well like you get like a vaccine,
like a flu shot.
Right?
Okay.

642
00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:13.970
So that's good for a whole year.
If they got the right fluid,

643
00:36:14.190 --> 00:36:15.780
that's probably one thing they're going to have some day.

644
00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.280
I like an immune booster,

645
00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:21.420
like something that they just shut you with and your immune system goes well.

646
00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:23.160
They have that for specific things like rabies.

647
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:27.460
Like I got rabies shots cause I was been by vampire bat.
No joke.
Whoa.
And uh,

648
00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:29.490
do you ever worry that you would turn,
you know,

649
00:36:29.491 --> 00:36:31.980
it happened and I just dealt with it.
Just deal with it.

650
00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:36.180
You sitting in your house looking out the window.
I feel in your fangs grow.

651
00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:39.930
That was really weird.
I woke up with a vampire bat literally feeding on my neck.

652
00:36:39.990 --> 00:36:43.320
That is so fucked.
We're worries.
I was in Colorado.

653
00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:46.250
It's the only time this has ever happened in the continental us where we were.

654
00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:49.080
Why were you sleeping?
You're a bat.
I was sleeping in a cabin.

655
00:36:49.081 --> 00:36:51.900
I didn't know the bat was in there.
I would have chosen a better place to sleep.

656
00:36:51.901 --> 00:36:54.840
So the bag was in the cabin.
You're sitting there sleeping.

657
00:36:55.050 --> 00:36:58.580
It swoops down and lands on your neck like a motherfucking movie.
Yep.

658
00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:01.260
And starts sucking the blood out of your,
I was asleep.

659
00:37:02.370 --> 00:37:06.930
I always go for the neck and it seems like so like or something.
Yeah,

660
00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:11.460
I was in a sleeping bag.
It's all tender there.
So I woke up and there was like,

661
00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:14.850
I just like having a dream and that these two like tinglies spots on my neck and

662
00:37:14.851 --> 00:37:17.610
my heart would beat and they tingle and they'd stop and with tingle and it would

663
00:37:17.611 --> 00:37:20.550
stop.
And I was like,
oh my God,
there's a mouse on my neck.

664
00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:24.690
So I reached up and I grabbed it and I was just a kid and this happened and,

665
00:37:24.710 --> 00:37:27.450
and I was,
I tried to squeeze it to kill it and it bit my thumb.

666
00:37:27.451 --> 00:37:30.450
So I throw it as hard as I could on the ground and it never hit the ground.

667
00:37:30.451 --> 00:37:34.500
And I'm like,
what was that?
It wasn't a mouse,
like it was something.

668
00:37:34.501 --> 00:37:37.200
And I was kind of freaked out and we turn on lights and we caught the bat.

669
00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:41.310
We brought it to the hospital and uh,
they told us it's okay to kill it.

670
00:37:41.311 --> 00:37:44.750
And we called all these bad experts and they all said,
yeah,
you know,

671
00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:46.350
you should pour ether in there and kill it.

672
00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:49.680
So we pour ether in this picture where the bat was so they could freeze it and

673
00:37:49.681 --> 00:37:53.730
look for rabies in its brain.
And when we pour the ether,
ether dissolves plastic.

674
00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:57.060
So the bat like falls under the floor in the hospital.
It's flopping around,

675
00:37:57.690 --> 00:38:01.280
I'm sure in Durango,
Colorado,
they still remember this.
So they're the,

676
00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:06.030
the plastic jug,
the poor,
the ether in it just dissolved the juggler it,
yeah,

677
00:38:06.031 --> 00:38:07.530
like the bottom of the jug just fell out.

678
00:38:07.531 --> 00:38:10.680
And so this is like half dead bat covered in plastic goose falls on the floor,

679
00:38:10.681 --> 00:38:14.820
the nurses are running around and I'm sitting there with my neck.
It was,

680
00:38:14.821 --> 00:38:16.080
it was crazy.
But yeah,

681
00:38:16.081 --> 00:38:19.590
so I could get an immune booster because I've had the whole Raby series one shot

682
00:38:19.591 --> 00:38:21.720
with like boost my immunity for a long time.

683
00:38:22.110 --> 00:38:24.960
So it's not that hard of a thought to say,
you know,

684
00:38:24.990 --> 00:38:26.730
if you drank a little bit of poison,

685
00:38:26.970 --> 00:38:29.910
it could cause a problem in your body for a long period of time.

686
00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:35.070
So I was just on Tom,
Tom,
Tom O'bryan,

687
00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:36.070
a friend of mine who's

688
00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:37.870
<v 1>just been studying gluten for like 30 years.</v>

689
00:38:38.230 --> 00:38:42.340
He has a gluten summit coming up in November sometime and I was one of his

690
00:38:42.341 --> 00:38:42.971
guests on there,

691
00:38:42.971 --> 00:38:46.090
but he interviewed like a whole bunch of different physicians who've been doing

692
00:38:46.091 --> 00:38:50.260
research on the immune effects of gluten.
Six months is a real number.

693
00:38:50.470 --> 00:38:53.980
It's not always there and those last few months it's a very tiny effect but it's

694
00:38:53.981 --> 00:38:57.940
measurable and detectable.
How do they measure that and detect that?

695
00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:01.060
That's what's confusing to me.
Like if you had a bowl of spaghetti,

696
00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:05.230
how the fuck could they measure the impact that that has six months in the

697
00:39:05.231 --> 00:39:06.760
future?
It depends on who you are,

698
00:39:06.761 --> 00:39:11.080
but one of the things they could do is they can draw your blood every so often,

699
00:39:11.081 --> 00:39:15.400
like every say month and they can see declining levels of antibodies

700
00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:19.480
specifically to the stuff you ate if you're sensitive to it,
but get this,

701
00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:20.740
when you eat gluten,

702
00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:24.640
it causes cross reactivity in your immune system and there's all panels of cross

703
00:39:24.641 --> 00:39:25.840
reactivity things you can do.

704
00:39:26.080 --> 00:39:31.080
What that means is that if your body is genetically or microbiologically set up

705
00:39:31.091 --> 00:39:31.924
that way,

706
00:39:31.990 --> 00:39:34.780
or let's say you have leaky gut because you didn't take your digestive enzymes,

707
00:39:35.110 --> 00:39:35.351
well,

708
00:39:35.351 --> 00:39:40.120
whatever the cause there is this happens and then the wheat tells your body,
Oh,

709
00:39:40.121 --> 00:39:42.790
you should attack your nervous system.
You should attack your heart tissue.

710
00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:46.240
You should attack your brain.
We tells it that damn straight.

711
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:49.660
Can't believe that fucking week.
I've never talked to weeds,

712
00:39:49.661 --> 00:39:53.920
so I guess I wouldn't never know.
We started talking and listen,
shut up bitch.

713
00:39:54.310 --> 00:39:59.290
I did nothing but bread eating my nerves.
Fuck you man.
You're an asshole.

714
00:40:00.110 --> 00:40:04.120
They found that they took blood from military guys in the military does is they

715
00:40:04.121 --> 00:40:04.841
save the blood.

716
00:40:04.841 --> 00:40:09.520
They draw for like 30 or 40 years and they went back and they looked at guys who

717
00:40:09.521 --> 00:40:12.460
got lupus and they looked at their blood and they found out that they could find

718
00:40:12.461 --> 00:40:13.930
10 years ahead of time.

719
00:40:14.350 --> 00:40:17.710
They could predict they're going to have lupus based on their antibodies to

720
00:40:17.711 --> 00:40:21.130
their own tissues and gluten stimulates those antibodies to your own tissues.

721
00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:24.700
I still don't understand how they would be able to detect six months worth of

722
00:40:24.701 --> 00:40:26.440
the impact of,
of gluten.

723
00:40:26.590 --> 00:40:30.820
I mean they would have to really restrict your diet for six months to isolate

724
00:40:30.821 --> 00:40:34.270
that.
It was just the gluten that caused those issues.
Well for me for instance,

725
00:40:34.271 --> 00:40:36.350
I don't touch gluten and stuff is like Kryptonite to me.
I,

726
00:40:36.430 --> 00:40:38.540
I really don't feel I get like zits and,

727
00:40:38.541 --> 00:40:41.000
and I just feel like crap and then I crave it and it's,

728
00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:44.980
it's just not okay for my immune system.
I like cookies.
Yeah.
You and me both.

729
00:40:45.010 --> 00:40:47.230
I like Spaghetti too,
but I've found gluten.
Spaghetti,

730
00:40:47.231 --> 00:40:51.400
there's some leg legit gluten pasta.
You got to get the kindness not dried.

731
00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:54.700
I found,
I found like the kind that you only boil for like two minutes.

732
00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:59.560
That's like the motion.
Well the kind that looks like,
like fresh pasta.
Oh,

733
00:40:59.561 --> 00:41:03.870
made out of yes or gluten.
I,
yeah,
it's mainly a rise.
Wow.
But,
but,

734
00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:07.760
but [inaudible] something that has no gluten,
but it's amazing.
The,

735
00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:11.200
the gluten free pastas that I've had,
they tastes just like regular pasta.

736
00:41:11.201 --> 00:41:15.150
Like you don't feel like you lose anything.
But the amount of time digesting it,

737
00:41:15.151 --> 00:41:18.100
it's incredibly different the way your body feels after.

738
00:41:18.101 --> 00:41:23.101
Like the other night I had a big bowl of this gluten free pasta with like this

739
00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:28.280
delicious sauce with garlic in it and I swear to God it tasted exactly like

740
00:41:28.601 --> 00:41:29.710
regular linguine.

741
00:41:29.890 --> 00:41:34.160
But the next like hour or two wasn't a struggle.

742
00:41:34.161 --> 00:41:37.610
Instinct conscious.
Yeah.
It wasn't that uh,

743
00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:40.640
that you get if you have a big bowl of like regular spaghetti.

744
00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:43.070
Isn't that the reason why like Chinese or Asian foods,

745
00:41:43.110 --> 00:41:47.210
I don't like you get hungry faster after that for this.
I never understood that.

746
00:41:47.570 --> 00:41:50.480
That was like an old joke.
It's MSG.
Is that what it is?

747
00:41:50.500 --> 00:41:54.350
Can Miss g drives your blood sugar up and then makes it crater and that's why

748
00:41:54.351 --> 00:41:55.670
you get hungry because your body is like,

749
00:41:55.671 --> 00:41:59.270
can I have some more energy to pump this extra glutamate out of my synapsis?
Oh,

750
00:41:59.271 --> 00:42:03.140
that makes sense.
I mean,
I've always tried to avoid MSG.
I don't know why,

751
00:42:03.141 --> 00:42:04.940
but I've heard that it's really bad for you.

752
00:42:05.090 --> 00:42:08.020
So maybe that's why I never understood the joke there.

753
00:42:08.021 --> 00:42:12.110
We say that like if he's really blunt for isn't it proven to cause cancer or

754
00:42:12.111 --> 00:42:14.180
something like that.
I don't know what is,

755
00:42:14.181 --> 00:42:17.840
I don't know about cancer connection there.
It's an exit Tory neurotoxin.

756
00:42:18.050 --> 00:42:20.000
So inside your synapse in our personnel,

757
00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:24.590
monosodium glutamate it,

758
00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:27.080
it'll cause your synapses to fire naturally.

759
00:42:27.081 --> 00:42:28.570
You squirt glutamate into instant apps,

760
00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:32.870
which causes an a little electrical signal to flow and then you suck that

761
00:42:32.871 --> 00:42:35.090
glutamate back out and that's how your brain works.

762
00:42:35.480 --> 00:42:37.610
The problem is when you get extra glutamate like that,

763
00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:39.800
then you have so much that even when you suck the glutamate out,

764
00:42:39.801 --> 00:42:41.570
there's still some left.
So your cells keep firing.

765
00:42:41.571 --> 00:42:44.510
That's what people would get migraines and they get tired,
they get sleepy.

766
00:42:44.720 --> 00:42:47.390
But if you're a restaurant and you toss a little MSG in there,

767
00:42:47.391 --> 00:42:49.280
even stuff that's legally you're allowed to say,

768
00:42:49.281 --> 00:42:52.550
I didn't know Msg even though what you added was 74% MSG,

769
00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:56.930
it's okay to say no MSG.
Then that's FDA.
Oh yeah.
Oh those whores.

770
00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:00.770
So you go to a restaurant and to cook honestly believes like the chef there will

771
00:43:00.771 --> 00:43:02.930
tell you,
look you straight in the eye and say there's no MSG in here.

772
00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:06.380
And he means it because he has things that say on the label,
no MSG.

773
00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:09.020
Because as long as it's at least 25% not Msg,

774
00:43:09.021 --> 00:43:12.200
you don't have to say what's in there.
That's hilarious.
And then he says,
look,

775
00:43:12.201 --> 00:43:15.110
people like it more because you eat this and it causes a food craving.

776
00:43:15.111 --> 00:43:18.260
So then you ordered dessert,
you order another drink.
So from his perspective,

777
00:43:18.261 --> 00:43:20.750
he's like,
hey,
people like it.
They order more food,
I'm more successful.

778
00:43:20.751 --> 00:43:23.030
They like it.
I'm doing it for my people.

779
00:43:23.330 --> 00:43:25.460
But what's the bad that's going on in their bodies?

780
00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:27.560
But what's going on is it just messed with their blood sugar.

781
00:43:27.561 --> 00:43:31.520
It caused massive cravings for sugar specifically cause it drove blood sugar up

782
00:43:31.550 --> 00:43:34.340
and made it drive down.
When it drives down,
you're getting like,

783
00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:36.620
like these cravings.
Like I think I'll have dessert,

784
00:43:36.621 --> 00:43:38.510
I think we'll have the coffee,
I think I'll have another beer,

785
00:43:38.511 --> 00:43:42.110
I'll have another soda.
So you have more yumminess in your life.
Absolutely.

786
00:43:42.111 --> 00:43:44.390
That's the only issue is more yumminess.
Well,

787
00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:48.440
the problem is too that those cells keep firing until they die and you get

788
00:43:48.441 --> 00:43:51.110
headaches and all sorts of other things like that.
But yeah,

789
00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:55.600
so there's no like specific thing that you have to fear for like your Dick's

790
00:43:55.610 --> 00:43:59.810
going to break or your brains can stop work in the brain's stopping working is

791
00:43:59.811 --> 00:44:04.250
what happens over time.
Uh,
I've not heard of buck cancer from investments.
G me.

792
00:44:04.260 --> 00:44:07.620
Your brain stops working.
Yeah,
it kills brain cells.
Really?
Yeah.

793
00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:11.750
What it says online,
there's an Wikipedia.
It's kind of,
I didn't know this,

794
00:44:11.810 --> 00:44:15.680
that it's one of the most abundant naturally occurring non essential amino
acids.

795
00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:20.670
The sodium salt of a glutamate,
glutamate,
glutamic,
how'd he say it?

796
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:24.440
Glutamic acid.
Tannic acid.
One of the most abundant,

797
00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:29.650
naturally occurring non essential amino acids and a tannic acid is but

798
00:44:29.721 --> 00:44:33.030
monosodium glutamate isn't,
that's the thing.
When they Mario,

799
00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:36.630
when they mano sodium eyes it to make up a word.
Um,

800
00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:39.410
that's what makes it highly purified.
That's what makes it too,

801
00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:41.970
that's the sodium salt,
glutamic acid,

802
00:44:41.971 --> 00:44:44.490
which is one of the most of that I should have said it better.
Look at soy sauce.

803
00:44:44.491 --> 00:44:47.670
Soy Sauce is full of naturally occurring MSG,
Umami,
that flavor that,

804
00:44:47.671 --> 00:44:49.110
that savory flavor that we want.

805
00:44:49.111 --> 00:44:52.350
That's basically the MSG tastes for the industry receptors on our tongue.

806
00:44:52.351 --> 00:44:54.900
It tastes good.
Which the bond,
what does that Umami,

807
00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:59.370
when you're a chef it's like the sixth flavor and it's something that comes from

808
00:44:59.371 --> 00:45:00.960
like charring your meat just right.

809
00:45:00.961 --> 00:45:05.340
Kind of searing the outside or using soy sauce.
The classical Emami taste.

810
00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:08.460
It was isolated by Japanese researchers who,

811
00:45:08.461 --> 00:45:12.510
funny enough invented MSG when they're trying to get to the bottom of what's the

812
00:45:12.511 --> 00:45:16.470
special taste that people enjoy.
The problem is that that tastes,

813
00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:17.760
especially in excess,

814
00:45:17.790 --> 00:45:22.050
causes these massive food cravings and drops in blood sugar and it causes brain

815
00:45:22.051 --> 00:45:25.740
cell death.
Uh,
but yummy.
Amen,

816
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:29.670
but put it in cookies.
How much danger is it like,

817
00:45:29.671 --> 00:45:31.050
is it something you should absolutely,

818
00:45:31.051 --> 00:45:33.930
definitely avoid or is it something like along like sugar?

819
00:45:34.140 --> 00:45:37.920
As long as you have it in moderation,
you should be okay.
Especially for kids,

820
00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:42.900
it should be illegal to give kids MSG because their gut isn't that good at

821
00:45:42.901 --> 00:45:45.870
filtering these things out and their blood brain barrier isn't fully formed.

822
00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:49.320
Not that it's that good of a barrier in anyone after that,

823
00:45:49.321 --> 00:45:52.290
it's a question of how healthy your tissues are,
what your genetics are.

824
00:45:52.410 --> 00:45:55.440
I don't think there's any argument that it's good for you.
I've never heard that.

825
00:45:55.441 --> 00:45:59.010
And it likely causes just weakness,
headaches,

826
00:45:59.070 --> 00:46:02.280
brain fog and tiredness and people and they don't know what's happening.

827
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:05.560
It doesn't look good.
When you're reading the,
uh,

828
00:46:06.090 --> 00:46:10.770
exit toxicity reports on a,
on Wikipedia,
it's bad news.
Oh my God.

829
00:46:10.771 --> 00:46:15.300
Yeah.
It's been shown in animal studies to cause damage in areas of the brain

830
00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:18.540
unprotected by the blood brain barrier.
Exactly.

831
00:46:18.541 --> 00:46:23.430
And that a variety of chronic diseases can arise out of this neurotoxic
toxicity,

832
00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:26.730
but it tastes good and it sells more food.
It's important.

833
00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:31.800
There's about 40 different code names for MSG that the food industry is legally

834
00:46:31.801 --> 00:46:35.010
allowed to use.
Spice extracts,
always MSG,

835
00:46:35.011 --> 00:46:38.400
but there are 74% MSG,
hydrolyzed soy protein,

836
00:46:38.401 --> 00:46:41.610
textured vegetable protein malt extract.

837
00:46:41.611 --> 00:46:45.720
How did we get so fucking whore?
Like how,
I mean,

838
00:46:45.721 --> 00:46:48.840
how did the food administration and the FDA,
whoever allows this,

839
00:46:48.990 --> 00:46:52.200
how did they get so horror like that?
They thought this is okay.

840
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:54.270
It was coffee's fault coffee.

841
00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:58.110
It turns out every one of the major package food companies out there right now

842
00:46:58.260 --> 00:46:59.970
started out marketing coffee.

843
00:47:00.570 --> 00:47:03.450
The kind of ancient history of coffee marketing,

844
00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:08.430
the techniques we use to manipulate people to eating the cheapest possible crap

845
00:47:08.431 --> 00:47:10.660
we can sell,
the stuff that causes the most craving.

846
00:47:10.661 --> 00:47:15.000
So they'll buy more of it that you can't eat.
Just one sort of marketing.
Uh,

847
00:47:15.010 --> 00:47:18.330
that all evolved from the very early days and all those companies today,

848
00:47:18.331 --> 00:47:23.331
like post in general mills started out as coffee merchants and they just spread

849
00:47:23.641 --> 00:47:25.940
into these other kinds of food and kind of makes sense.
Do that.

850
00:47:25.950 --> 00:47:29.920
Because if you start out with that coffee,
without a doubt as addictive,

851
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:31.120
<v 0>I mean everybody knows it.</v>

852
00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:34.900
This is a place near me that has two Starbucks right next to each other.

853
00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:37.270
There's a Starbucks,
it's right here.

854
00:47:37.420 --> 00:47:42.160
And then there's a supermarket that's like 30 paces away with a big Starbucks

855
00:47:42.161 --> 00:47:45.850
sign.
So there's a Starbucks in the supermarket and there's a Starbucks store and

856
00:47:45.851 --> 00:47:47.830
they're right next to each other.
It's hilarious.

857
00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:50.140
We're going to have to put a bullet proof on the third corner and just

858
00:47:51.970 --> 00:47:55.450
are you gonna start a chain?
You should.
You should do a bulletproof coffee chain.

859
00:47:55.451 --> 00:47:57.330
Most people have no idea what the fuck this stuff is.

860
00:47:57.710 --> 00:48:02.210
What I give people bullet proof coffee.
They always go like,
Whoa,
Ooh.

861
00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:07.240
The question everybody has about bulletproof.
This is the controversial question,

862
00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:09.710
this process that you have these,

863
00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:13.720
the bunch of questions for folks who don't know what bulletproof coffee is.
Dave,

864
00:48:13.721 --> 00:48:16.690
uh,
invented some,
this is how I found out about Dave Tate.

865
00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:21.720
Fletcher came over to the Ice House studio and he brought this delicious thermos

866
00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:27.520
of amazing coffee that has stevia in it,
butter.
And I was like,

867
00:48:27.521 --> 00:48:29.110
what the fuck are you drinking,
man?

868
00:48:29.350 --> 00:48:34.180
And he's telling me about bulletproof coffee and it's coffee that is mixed with

869
00:48:34.181 --> 00:48:38.020
MCT oil and grass fed butter.

870
00:48:38.021 --> 00:48:40.540
And then more importantly,

871
00:48:40.870 --> 00:48:45.370
I started reading about mycotoxins and how it just generally accepted it is that

872
00:48:45.371 --> 00:48:48.820
there's mycotoxins in a lot of different coffee that you buy,
you know,

873
00:48:48.821 --> 00:48:52.220
and that people aren't testing for it and they just accept it and that you're,

874
00:48:52.221 --> 00:48:53.680
you're drinking this fungus.

875
00:48:54.020 --> 00:48:55.010
<v 4>It's worse than that.</v>

876
00:48:55.940 --> 00:49:00.680
We know this is such a big problem that in the EU there's a limit on one of the

877
00:49:00.710 --> 00:49:04.610
many different ones I test for.
In Singapore,

878
00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:06.650
in South Korea,
in Japan,

879
00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:09.860
there are legal limits on this toxin called Okra toxin.

880
00:49:10.070 --> 00:49:11.330
But in the u s there's no limit.

881
00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:16.220
So where do you think those shipments of coffee that are above the limit where

882
00:49:16.221 --> 00:49:19.430
you can sell it in Europe?
Where do you think they go?
They'll go here.
Yeah.

883
00:49:19.550 --> 00:49:22.670
Holy Shit.
I'm not kidding.
And that's just one of the toxins.

884
00:49:22.710 --> 00:49:26.690
The stuff I test for is not regulated in any country.
So how toxic though,

885
00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:29.120
when you say Mycotoxins,
I mean,
what is,

886
00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:32.120
what are the studies do a Google search for Okra toxin.
Oh,

887
00:49:32.121 --> 00:49:35.120
so eight o C.
H.
R.
A.
T.
O.
X.
I.
N.

888
00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:39.410
I've gotten more than a thousand references to human health conditions indexed

889
00:49:39.411 --> 00:49:41.510
by condition,
getting ready to go up on the website.

890
00:49:41.540 --> 00:49:45.170
This is a major human health hazard,
not just in coffee,
it's in lots of foods.

891
00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:48.530
And on the bulletproof diet there,
I said the B word again.

892
00:49:49.250 --> 00:49:50.900
What I'm doing there is I'm saying,
look,

893
00:49:50.901 --> 00:49:54.740
these are the foods that from a base perspective cause the least inflammation

894
00:49:54.741 --> 00:49:57.590
and the ones that are most likely to be moldy are going to be on the more

895
00:49:57.591 --> 00:49:59.450
dangerous side of things is not going to be,
I'll never eat them.

896
00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:03.370
They'll just be on the watch list.
Sweat this.
This is the,
uh,
the,

897
00:50:03.371 --> 00:50:06.410
the description of it on Wikipedia.
Okra toxin

898
00:50:06.490 --> 00:50:09.100
<v 0>is Okra toxin a is a,</v>

899
00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:14.290
is known to occur in commodities such as cereal,
coffee,
dried fruit and red wine.

900
00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:19.210
It's possibly a human carcinogen and is of special interest as it can be

901
00:50:19.211 --> 00:50:22.180
accumulated in the meat of animals.
Thus,

902
00:50:22.181 --> 00:50:26.560
meat and meat products can be contaminated with this toxin.

903
00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:28.250
Exposure to Okra,

904
00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:33.110
toxins through diet can cause acute toxicity and Mammalian kidneys.

905
00:50:33.140 --> 00:50:37.520
That's you.
You're a mammal fuck face.
And maybe carcinogenic.

906
00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:40.700
That's insane,
isn't it?
Get this,
why doesn't it say coffee though?

907
00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:44.600
There's a reason that you should eat grass fed meat too.

908
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:48.650
This is one of the many reasons because these toxins that are common in grains

909
00:50:48.651 --> 00:50:50.000
and cereals,
they,
by the way,

910
00:50:50.001 --> 00:50:53.690
they feed the crap cereal to the animals that they're going to feed you because

911
00:50:53.691 --> 00:50:54.950
the cereals that have high mold,

912
00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:58.730
they can't feed them to the pregnant cows because pregnant cows miscarry when

913
00:50:58.731 --> 00:51:01.520
they eat the toxic grain.
So they save it for the stuff you're going to eat.

914
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:04.850
That's insane.
It's disgusting.
Oh,
that's so gross.

915
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:09.620
The grain thing is a real big issue.
And a lot of folks don't recognize that guy.

916
00:51:09.621 --> 00:51:12.710
I was at the supermarket the other day and this guy was trying to talk me into

917
00:51:12.711 --> 00:51:16.490
buying grain fed beef because it was fattier and more delicious.
And I was like,

918
00:51:16.491 --> 00:51:19.940
no,
dude,
I know what I want.
Like I'm trying to get grass fed beef for a reason.

919
00:51:20.990 --> 00:51:25.370
You're selling a,
an animal that's sick.
They had,
um,
two different,
uh,

920
00:51:25.640 --> 00:51:29.750
two different rows of meat and on one row it was these grass fed rib eyes.

921
00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:31.040
And they're very small.

922
00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:36.280
It's interesting like the rib steak from a a a grasp at cal is far smaller than

923
00:51:36.501 --> 00:51:39.320
the ones from these corn fed cows and they were right next to each other,

924
00:51:39.321 --> 00:51:44.321
but one of them was like a dark red and the other one was like this Paler,

925
00:51:44.750 --> 00:51:46.910
sicker fattier,

926
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:51.950
sort of like red ish color and that was the ones that were corn fed and I was

927
00:51:51.951 --> 00:51:55.580
like,
wow,
this is like right in front of your face.
That's a healthy animal.

928
00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:58.660
That's a sick animal.
The problem with those sick animals is,

929
00:51:58.690 --> 00:52:00.680
and they are fucking delicious.

930
00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:04.940
If you take one of those sick fat ones and you slap that bitch on the on the

931
00:52:04.941 --> 00:52:09.170
grill and he see all that fat crackling and everything,
it does taste good,

932
00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:13.280
but I like grass fed better.
You don't cook it as long.

933
00:52:13.281 --> 00:52:16.310
It doesn't have nearly as much fat in it.
It's a much quicker cooking method,

934
00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:20.060
but you get used to the taste of it and the texture of it,
they just,

935
00:52:20.090 --> 00:52:22.160
I think it's a better tasting beef.

936
00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:26.300
It is way more way better for you.
That's undisputable.

937
00:52:26.330 --> 00:52:29.090
It's better for it and once you get like used to that taste,

938
00:52:29.091 --> 00:52:30.380
the other stuff doesn't taste good anymore.

939
00:52:30.381 --> 00:52:32.180
It leaves like a coating in your mouth.

940
00:52:32.181 --> 00:52:36.050
Like I went to one of those high end chain steak houses where you spend 80 bucks

941
00:52:36.051 --> 00:52:39.770
on a steak and I'm like,
all right,
I'll get it.
And I cut the fat off the steak,

942
00:52:39.771 --> 00:52:41.780
which I never do because it didn't taste right.

943
00:52:41.810 --> 00:52:43.370
Like I could tell it wasn't good for me,

944
00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:48.140
but when I get the stuff from a cow that's raised on grass,
especially fresh,

945
00:52:48.170 --> 00:52:52.520
like just pasture,
the fats like a yellowish color and it just tastes so good,

946
00:52:52.521 --> 00:52:55.250
you get like a food high from it.
It is a different taste.
It's a,

947
00:52:55.570 --> 00:53:00.140
the fat is way different.
The the,
that yellow fat,
it's really interesting.

948
00:53:00.170 --> 00:53:04.520
It looks different.
You know,
the what really gets me is the way it tastes.

949
00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:08.120
It just tastes like an animal that's more gamey.
Tastes like a wild animal.

950
00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:09.283
You know when you eat,

951
00:53:09.530 --> 00:53:13.070
like a lot of people don't like the Gamey taste of venison,

952
00:53:13.220 --> 00:53:16.040
but a lot of what you're eating when you're eating venison is the diet of the

953
00:53:16.041 --> 00:53:20.420
animal.
Like if you get venison that's from a farm like farm raised venison,

954
00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:24.330
it tastes very different than wild venison.
Wild Venison has like a,

955
00:53:24.331 --> 00:53:26.010
it's like a feeling when you're

956
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:29.820
<v 1>eating it.
Like it's all alive.
Like this is like a powerful piece of meat.</v>

957
00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:32.460
The farm venison that I've had,

958
00:53:32.490 --> 00:53:35.630
I've had some of it that's really good and have at other with it feels like,
man,

959
00:53:35.631 --> 00:53:38.100
he must be given.
These guys have same fucking shit they give cows.

960
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:42.150
It's kind of flat tasting.
It's not a live is a great word for it.

961
00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:45.380
It's not running,
it's not running from bullets.
And I interviewed,
uh,

962
00:53:45.690 --> 00:53:49.970
Glenn Elzinga on,
on my Pi fucking Glenn and didn't know who this guy is.

963
00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:54.210
Like he spent his whole life raising like 500 cattle and we went into all these

964
00:53:54.211 --> 00:53:59.211
crazy details and he said the secret to having the best grass fed mean was that

965
00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:02.460
you wanted to go in and,

966
00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:06.690
and let the cows pick the grass stayed eat and that a cow will naturally get

967
00:54:06.691 --> 00:54:09.060
like the clump of grass that has the most nutrients for it.

968
00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:14.060
Like they have radar for the right kinds of food and his meat has the darkest

969
00:54:14.281 --> 00:54:17.700
yellow fat I've ever had.
So it's,
you know,
it just,

970
00:54:17.701 --> 00:54:20.190
one of the things where you have these guys who make wine,

971
00:54:20.730 --> 00:54:23.940
there's the equivalent level of artistry for people who make beef.

972
00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:26.880
And he told me about how after you slaughter the animal,

973
00:54:26.881 --> 00:54:30.510
like how they do it in an ethical way.
So there's no pain,
no suffering,

974
00:54:30.511 --> 00:54:32.010
they don't see each other die and all that.

975
00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:35.610
But then like when you cool the animal determines whether you have a tender

976
00:54:35.611 --> 00:54:37.980
steak or a tough stake.
So there's this incredibly complex,

977
00:54:37.981 --> 00:54:41.400
like our [inaudible] process.
I did not know all those details,

978
00:54:41.401 --> 00:54:43.230
but I can't wait to have my own cows.
Like,

979
00:54:43.231 --> 00:54:46.410
I'm going to be like a cow hacker one of these days.
A smart move.

980
00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:51.240
I would love to have a small farm,
like a farm for just me and my friends.

981
00:54:51.300 --> 00:54:54.210
You know,
we all like,
I think,
I think it's totally doable.

982
00:54:54.390 --> 00:54:55.740
I've got an offer in on one right now.

983
00:54:56.250 --> 00:54:59.760
Fingers crossed in America and he's in Canada.
Godforsaken land to the north.

984
00:54:59.910 --> 00:55:02.990
It's on an island in the godforsaken land to the north.
But,
uh,
I'm,

985
00:55:02.991 --> 00:55:04.130
I'm really hoping that,
uh,

986
00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:07.620
that we get the financing we're looking for because I will have several cows on

987
00:55:07.621 --> 00:55:10.810
it and I'll invite you over steak dude with the shit.

988
00:55:11.090 --> 00:55:13.710
I go goof around about Canada,
but when the shit hits the fan,

989
00:55:13.711 --> 00:55:18.390
I'm fucking move in there for she z.
I almost moved there in 2008.

990
00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:22.710
I got real close when George W.
Bush was,
it was an office and I was like,

991
00:55:22.711 --> 00:55:26.370
this is the,
that's the year I moved there.
Yeah,
that was whoever,
Toronto,

992
00:55:26.371 --> 00:55:27.000
what are you thinking?

993
00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.660
I was going to go Vancouver cause I don't want to freeze to death.
But uh,

994
00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:33.060
if you're going to freeze to death,
Toronto's the move.
Toronto's bad ass.

995
00:55:33.090 --> 00:55:35.490
It's huge.
It's a great town.
It's,

996
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:39.600
it's got a weird thing going on because you have all the intelligence and

997
00:55:39.601 --> 00:55:44.370
worldliness of a big city,
but you have nice people.
Yeah.
It's like,
it's weird.

998
00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:46.740
I mean there's some Douche in Toronto,
don't get me wrong,

999
00:55:46.770 --> 00:55:48.470
there's Douche bags everywhere.
They're unavoidable.

1000
00:55:48.500 --> 00:55:51.580
I mean there's a certain percentage of human beings that were raised by fuck

1001
00:55:51.581 --> 00:55:55.980
heads.
They did a terrible job and created a shit product.
Just what it is.

1002
00:55:56.190 --> 00:56:01.190
It's the same as if you gave a bunch of people up car parts and had them put

1003
00:56:01.381 --> 00:56:02.490
together their own cars.

1004
00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:05.340
There's some people that are going to put together amazing cars and there's some

1005
00:56:05.341 --> 00:56:05.911
dick heads.

1006
00:56:05.911 --> 00:56:08.910
They're going to develop things with their fucking wheels fly off on the
highway.

1007
00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:13.110
It's exactly right.
People suck.
I gotta tell Ya Canadians,

1008
00:56:13.500 --> 00:56:15.330
they're so friendly.
I love living.

1009
00:56:15.350 --> 00:56:19.590
I'm grateful to have been able to move up there because like even in traffic,

1010
00:56:19.770 --> 00:56:20.820
like people don't cut you off,

1011
00:56:20.821 --> 00:56:23.950
they let you in and like it's just a whole different experience.

1012
00:56:23.951 --> 00:56:27.280
Especially I come down to la where like drivers are more aggressive.

1013
00:56:27.850 --> 00:56:30.460
I'm happy to drive in heavy traffic like this,

1014
00:56:30.461 --> 00:56:33.310
but when I go up there I have to like take a deep breath and calm down.

1015
00:56:33.311 --> 00:56:35.170
Otherwise I'd like cut in front of all these slow cars,

1016
00:56:35.171 --> 00:56:37.610
but then I would be like one of those American jerks and I don't want to do
that.

1017
00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:38.513
<v 0>Well it's,</v>

1018
00:56:38.790 --> 00:56:43.790
they've done these studies on rats where they stuff them into a room and they

1019
00:56:43.951 --> 00:56:47.290
have 10 rats in a room.
Then they have 20 rats and Roman,
they,

1020
00:56:47.520 --> 00:56:51.690
they've shown like what happens with rat population densities.

1021
00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:53.790
So same thing that happens to people in cities.

1022
00:56:53.791 --> 00:56:57.430
Rat start sitting in the corner by themselves and rocking back and forth the

1023
00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:57.781
exhibit,

1024
00:56:57.781 --> 00:57:02.580
all these weird fucking goofy behavior characteristics and they do it in large

1025
00:57:02.581 --> 00:57:04.830
numbers.
That's what you're dealing with in Los Angeles.

1026
00:57:04.831 --> 00:57:09.480
When he sees crazy people cut in front of each other and fucking flying down the

1027
00:57:09.481 --> 00:57:13.920
road.
You know,
doing all this asshole is shit.
There's too many people.

1028
00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:16.680
Too many God damn people.
Yeah,
they're freaking out.

1029
00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:20.250
They're trying to get away from everybody.
But when I was in boulder,

1030
00:57:20.370 --> 00:57:24.120
there's such a marked difference in the way people drive in boulder and boulder.

1031
00:57:24.121 --> 00:57:26.550
People wave to each other.
There's only a hundred thousand of them.

1032
00:57:26.551 --> 00:57:29.150
They would fucking hit the blinkers.
They let you in.

1033
00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:31.740
Nobody's in a rush and you feel different when you're there.

1034
00:57:31.741 --> 00:57:36.200
Like there's a general tone in the air that feels more calm and relaxed.
It's,

1035
00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:39.540
I find it quite fascinating how palpable it is.

1036
00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:41.310
So how do we bring that to big cities?

1037
00:57:41.311 --> 00:57:45.480
Because I tell everybody it's the only way you're going to have to,

1038
00:57:45.510 --> 00:57:47.490
there's going to have to be a mass purging.

1039
00:57:48.420 --> 00:57:49.910
<v 1>That's pretty dark,
Joe.
I mean,</v>

1040
00:57:49.911 --> 00:57:52.240
you don't think there's somebody who can maybe hack the cities to make them look

1041
00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:53.083
more biological.
Okay.

1042
00:57:53.530 --> 00:57:57.760
<v 0>I put zero thought into how to fix it.
When I say kill everybody,
I'm choking.</v>

1043
00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:01.030
Um,
I think though there is an issue,
there's,

1044
00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:02.860
there's certainly an issue of how many people,

1045
00:58:02.861 --> 00:58:07.861
but I think that issue could be possibly managed by having some sort of real

1046
00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:14.880
comprehensive mental health program in this country for adults and have it,

1047
00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:17.500
you know,
everybody's sort of on their own.

1048
00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:19.690
They're on their own from the time they get to high school,

1049
00:58:19.691 --> 00:58:23.260
essentially their parents drop them off at school,
the parents are working,

1050
00:58:23.350 --> 00:58:26.260
they come home and then you know,
the parents are tired from work.

1051
00:58:26.261 --> 00:58:28.520
You basically raising yourself for 14 hours,

1052
00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:31.690
like a little bit of influence by the older people around you.

1053
00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:36.100
Don't get into too much trouble,
but you're kind of like,
that's stupid.
All right.

1054
00:58:36.101 --> 00:58:40.570
It's the most complex part of a child's life and it,
it's the most,

1055
00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:44.050
as far as like when you're establishing your,
your,

1056
00:58:44.051 --> 00:58:48.220
your traits and establishing your,
your way and your ethics and the way,

1057
00:58:48.221 --> 00:58:49.360
the way you're going to live your life,

1058
00:58:49.690 --> 00:58:54.610
you develop a lot of those patterns when you're like 14 and 15 and 16.

1059
00:58:55.090 --> 00:59:00.090
Those are the years that I think it's very important to help people figure out

1060
00:59:00.671 --> 00:59:05.050
how to manage life,
help people figure out how to think,
help inspire them,

1061
00:59:05.051 --> 00:59:07.450
help show them the what,
what,

1062
00:59:07.451 --> 00:59:11.620
what can be gained from setting goals and achieving them and that excellent

1063
00:59:11.621 --> 00:59:15.520
feeling and that it becomes contagious and then you can do more with that and

1064
00:59:15.521 --> 00:59:16.690
you can inspire other people.

1065
00:59:16.691 --> 00:59:20.200
You can surround yourself with a bunch of likeminded people and instead of being

1066
00:59:20.201 --> 00:59:21.100
jealous of each other,

1067
00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:25.010
actually elevate each other and grow stronger as a group than you would as

1068
00:59:25.011 --> 00:59:25.844
individuals.

1069
00:59:26.090 --> 00:59:30.680
There's a lot of things that people just don't get to learn and sometimes you're

1070
00:59:30.681 --> 00:59:34.040
around the wrong people.
You have the wrong job,
you have the wrong career,

1071
00:59:34.041 --> 00:59:36.470
you have the wrong whatever,
and you never get around those people.

1072
00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:40.700
And then one day you're old as fuck and you realize you wasted your life doing

1073
00:59:40.701 --> 00:59:42.290
shitty things that are boring,

1074
00:59:42.410 --> 00:59:45.680
hanging around with assholes who have no social skills,

1075
00:59:45.830 --> 00:59:48.950
nobody elevated anybody and then you're fucking ticker stops.

1076
00:59:49.500 --> 00:59:51.180
<v 1>Yeah,
that's a tragedy.
When that happen.</v>

1077
00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:56.080
<v 0>It is a tragedy.
I don't think that that,
I don't think that that is necessary.</v>

1078
00:59:56.081 --> 01:00:00.490
That aspect of society.
I really feel like it's a mismanaged resource issue.

1079
01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:05.740
I think that human beings essentially,
besides being life and besides being,

1080
01:00:05.741 --> 01:00:08.140
you know,
our brothers and sisters in the community of the world,

1081
01:00:08.350 --> 01:00:12.530
we're also a resource and a life is a resource.
The,

1082
01:00:12.531 --> 01:00:16.270
from what I've always said,
if this country was smart,

1083
01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:19.780
instead of like spending all this money fucking with people in other countries,

1084
01:00:19.930 --> 01:00:21.580
you want to build up,
do you want,

1085
01:00:21.581 --> 01:00:23.800
do you want to figure out how to make this country strong?

1086
01:00:23.801 --> 01:00:28.801
It's not by suppressing or the people inside of it or controlling natural

1087
01:00:30.071 --> 01:00:31.010
resources.
It's not.

1088
01:00:31.300 --> 01:00:35.800
It's by making it so that there's the smallest amount of losers possible.

1089
01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:37.730
Find out what's the weakest link.
Well,

1090
01:00:37.731 --> 01:00:40.940
the weakest link is people that are born as shit economic situations.
Yeah.

1091
01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:42.310
Parents don't give a fuck.

1092
01:00:42.430 --> 01:00:47.430
Find them and help them eliminate the possibility of weak scenarios being the

1093
01:00:50.591 --> 01:00:51.370
cause for weeks

1094
01:00:51.370 --> 01:00:52.990
<v 1>people.
You ever see that study?</v>

1095
01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:57.010
They went to like the poorest neighborhoods and they went to to families with

1096
01:00:57.011 --> 01:01:01.540
young kids and they gave them one brightly colored toy and that was it.

1097
01:01:01.810 --> 01:01:05.200
And then they tracked the results like 15 and 20 years later.

1098
01:01:05.410 --> 01:01:09.220
And there was a noticeable Iq difference in like a life success difference from

1099
01:01:09.221 --> 01:01:12.520
the kids who got just a little bit more mental stimulation for having something

1100
01:01:12.521 --> 01:01:14.500
like child liked to play with instead of just,
you know,

1101
01:01:14.501 --> 01:01:16.000
playing in squalor basically.

1102
01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:19.120
It doesn't take that much to move the needle in a big way.

1103
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:21.930
<v 0>I think also just giving them something is also,</v>

1104
01:01:21.931 --> 01:01:24.690
it gives them like this feeling like someone did something nice to me.

1105
01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:25.740
It feels good.

1106
01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:30.120
It's not having a material possession is not really even,

1107
01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:34.230
what's the important aspect of it?
It's receiving something kind,

1108
01:01:34.231 --> 01:01:35.640
receiving something generous.

1109
01:01:36.190 --> 01:01:37.930
<v 1>I honestly didn't think when I was a kid,</v>

1110
01:01:37.931 --> 01:01:41.680
I mean I didn't grow up wealthy or particularly poor.
Um,

1111
01:01:41.890 --> 01:01:45.970
call it middle class in Albuquerque,
New Mexico,
actually home of breaking bad.

1112
01:01:46.460 --> 01:01:51.280
And uh,
I did not know that it was normal to expect people to help you.

1113
01:01:51.281 --> 01:01:52.090
I seriously just,

1114
01:01:52.090 --> 01:01:55.010
that wasn't part of the way I thought the world worked and I didn't figure it

1115
01:01:55.011 --> 01:01:58.840
out.
So tells my mid twenties and it was like,
holy crap.
So like now I'm like,

1116
01:01:58.841 --> 01:02:01.540
it's pretty easy to pay for the toll for the guy behind you or you know,

1117
01:02:01.541 --> 01:02:03.160
buy a cup of coffee for someone else,

1118
01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:05.320
the way people do at Starbucks and just kind of pay it forward.

1119
01:02:05.470 --> 01:02:08.560
But it changes someone's whole day just to know that like someone gave a crap

1120
01:02:08.561 --> 01:02:09.140
about you

1121
01:02:09.140 --> 01:02:12.860
<v 0>but someone's nice.
Yeah,
that's a sweet thing to do.
It is tipping too.</v>

1122
01:02:12.861 --> 01:02:15.730
That's another big one.
You know,
when someone waits on you give them a little,

1123
01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:18.290
a couple extra box.
It's fun.
It makes it,
you know,

1124
01:02:18.291 --> 01:02:22.440
you don't notice and they feel great.
And so that,
that does spread,
that does,

1125
01:02:22.770 --> 01:02:24.800
it moves on to other people as well.

1126
01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:28.870
<v 1>We got to do is rites of passage like every society forever,</v>

1127
01:02:28.871 --> 01:02:32.170
especially for young men,
there was rites of passage for women that too,

1128
01:02:32.171 --> 01:02:35.700
like the Quinceanera,
but for men,
there really isn't one.

1129
01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:37.610
You talk about being 14 and all that,
you know,

1130
01:02:37.611 --> 01:02:41.680
there's no boy scouts for most people anymore.
Uh,
and the whole,
like,

1131
01:02:41.681 --> 01:02:44.390
you become a man,
you know,
what do you do when you're 16?

1132
01:02:44.420 --> 01:02:46.510
We used to send them out in the desert with a knife and you know,

1133
01:02:46.511 --> 01:02:48.940
willing cloth and saying,
come,
come back or don't.

1134
01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.320
<v 0>That's a good way to not have men.</v>

1135
01:02:50.950 --> 01:02:54.460
It sounds like some sort of a crazy feminist lesbian agenda.

1136
01:02:54.730 --> 01:02:58.540
Try to remove men from the planet.
You guys aren't hard enough.

1137
01:02:58.541 --> 01:03:02.950
You fucking pussies.
You got to go naked with a knife.
It's a slower abortion.

1138
01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:05.500
Yeah,
well it's a late term one.
Yeah,

1139
01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:08.330
<v 1>the late,
but it,
it makes a difference because you know,
it,</v>

1140
01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:11.270
it does something for the psyche for young men.

1141
01:03:11.271 --> 01:03:12.320
And when you're a teenager like that,

1142
01:03:12.321 --> 01:03:14.840
you've got enough hormones raging and all that stuff to kind of feel the sense

1143
01:03:14.841 --> 01:03:15.800
of community and all that.

1144
01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:19.310
So I have no idea how to create rites of passage because that wasn't really a

1145
01:03:19.311 --> 01:03:20.091
huge part of my life.

1146
01:03:20.091 --> 01:03:23.390
But this research I've seen on that says that's pretty important for,

1147
01:03:23.391 --> 01:03:26.330
for kids at different ages.
And then you get this whole thing like,
oh,

1148
01:03:26.331 --> 01:03:29.150
you're 18 now,
you know,
you can go out,
you can hold a gun,
you can vote,

1149
01:03:29.151 --> 01:03:32.360
but you can't drink yet.
Uh,
so you know more power to you,

1150
01:03:32.361 --> 01:03:36.470
but your prefrontal Cortex isn't done until you're 23,
maybe even 25.

1151
01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:39.680
So what about like the development that happens in your twenties when you

1152
01:03:39.681 --> 01:03:41.220
realize around like 23 like,
oh,

1153
01:03:41.270 --> 01:03:44.440
I probably can't drink every night of the week because I'm,
you know,

1154
01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:46.730
not holding up as well as I'd like.
I'm tired all the time.

1155
01:03:46.970 --> 01:03:48.110
So by the time you're 25,

1156
01:03:48.111 --> 01:03:51.230
you're like different than you were when you were 23 then when you're 21 and

1157
01:03:51.231 --> 01:03:55.070
when you're 30 and 40,
you don't stop evolving through the course of your life.

1158
01:03:55.071 --> 01:03:56.330
And like Erickson and guys,

1159
01:03:56.331 --> 01:03:59.330
I'll study that and wrote about the stages of adult development.

1160
01:03:59.331 --> 01:04:01.220
You can Google that and it like,

1161
01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:05.300
why did we stop paying attention to people when they basically turn 18 and it's

1162
01:04:05.301 --> 01:04:07.160
like,
there you go.
Hope you don't end up in jail.

1163
01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:07.641
<v 0>Yeah,</v>

1164
01:04:07.641 --> 01:04:11.090
and we don't even pay attention to them before they even turn 18 but once they

1165
01:04:11.091 --> 01:04:14.450
start talking back,
we just fucking,
you're on your own fuck face.
You know,

1166
01:04:14.930 --> 01:04:15.321
I think,

1167
01:04:15.321 --> 01:04:19.940
and it's once a kid is on a path to like if a kid is on a path to becoming an

1168
01:04:19.941 --> 01:04:22.190
electrical engineer or a on a path to,

1169
01:04:22.490 --> 01:04:26.090
it's very difficult to jump off of a path you've already started.

1170
01:04:26.120 --> 01:04:28.160
That's one of the hardest things to do in life.

1171
01:04:28.370 --> 01:04:30.590
When you already have some momentum and success,

1172
01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:34.070
it makes it actually even harder and it shouldn't.
It should eat,

1173
01:04:34.071 --> 01:04:36.470
should reaffirm like if you've been successful at this,

1174
01:04:36.650 --> 01:04:40.190
you could be successful at anything.
But most people don't think like that.

1175
01:04:40.191 --> 01:04:44.180
They think,
well,
hey,
this is x is my specialty.
If I decide that lot,

1176
01:04:44.181 --> 01:04:47.420
why is my real love?
I'm going to start from scratch.
I don't want to do that.

1177
01:04:47.570 --> 01:04:49.850
You know?
I don't want to tell him.
I don't want to,
you know,

1178
01:04:49.851 --> 01:04:51.290
I'm competing with my colleagues.

1179
01:04:51.291 --> 01:04:53.870
I don't want to all of a sudden be back to square one.

1180
01:04:53.871 --> 01:04:55.640
And these guys are at step seven or eight.

1181
01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:01.000
It's like you're on a train and you're your trains moving and you can jump off,

1182
01:05:01.340 --> 01:05:01.851
but if you do,

1183
01:05:01.851 --> 01:05:06.170
you got to go all the way the fuck back and then you've got to go in another

1184
01:05:06.171 --> 01:05:10.010
direction.
It's like you're not just starting from scratch.

1185
01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:13.430
You have to run all the way back and start from scratch.

1186
01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:18.700
<v 1>Part of the problem here is there's so much regulation,
all these professional</v>

1187
01:05:18.730 --> 01:05:22.930
<v 4>trade organizations that make it damn near impossible for someone who's</v>

1188
01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:26.920
sincerely interested in,
in doing a new career to enter the career,

1189
01:05:26.921 --> 01:05:29.890
whether you want to be a plumber,
like try and just go out there and say,

1190
01:05:29.891 --> 01:05:32.790
you know,
I had read all the books,
I learned all this stuff.
By the time you,

1191
01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:33.670
you do all the things,

1192
01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:37.210
you're going to have invested years and a ton of money just to be allowed to go

1193
01:05:37.211 --> 01:05:39.520
into someone's house and put a wrench on a pipe by yourself.

1194
01:05:39.790 --> 01:05:43.060
And the same thing goes if you want to do some sort of quasi medical,

1195
01:05:43.061 --> 01:05:44.620
like like physical therapists.

1196
01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:48.640
The line between a really good functional movement trainer and a physical

1197
01:05:48.641 --> 01:05:52.120
therapist is pretty blurry in my experience.

1198
01:05:52.390 --> 01:05:56.860
Yet one group has like severe restrictions on who can call themselves that in a

1199
01:05:56.861 --> 01:05:58.690
very rigid requirements for what it takes.

1200
01:05:58.810 --> 01:06:00.340
And the other group may have similar skills,

1201
01:06:00.341 --> 01:06:02.410
but they're not even allowed to talk about some of what they do.

1202
01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:06.640
So I'd like to see a little bit more fluidity around people's careers because

1203
01:06:06.641 --> 01:06:08.830
maybe we say,
all right,
this guy is certified,

1204
01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:11.020
but this guy is doing similar things.
He's not certified.

1205
01:06:11.021 --> 01:06:12.130
He's probably going to charge less,

1206
01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:14.140
but at least he's allowed to talk about what he does.

1207
01:06:14.141 --> 01:06:16.600
But right now there's not know what the fuck he's doing.

1208
01:06:16.970 --> 01:06:20.440
<v 0>That's where it becomes really problematic is how do we know this guy knows what</v>

1209
01:06:20.441 --> 01:06:24.190
the fuck he's doing?
Yeah.
Well I think that it's,

1210
01:06:25.510 --> 01:06:28.780
it's just unfortunate for that a lot of folks get on a path that they're,

1211
01:06:28.781 --> 01:06:30.070
they're not actually enjoying.

1212
01:06:30.370 --> 01:06:34.240
And I think a lot of times you're getting advice from parents or friends or

1213
01:06:34.241 --> 01:06:38.290
girlfriends or boyfriends or there,
you know,
say,
hey,
this is the safer bet,

1214
01:06:38.291 --> 01:06:42.640
this is the more likely scenario for success.
You can't think like that.

1215
01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:45.940
And it didn't work for me.
It doesn't work for anybody.
I mean,

1216
01:06:45.941 --> 01:06:49.030
you can decide it works for you until you see someone who's living the life they

1217
01:06:49.031 --> 01:06:52.130
actually want to live.
Then you're like,
fuck,
you know,

1218
01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:56.800
you think that it's impossible to do something different than what everybody

1219
01:06:56.801 --> 01:06:59.650
else is doing.
It's working in a job,
working in a cubicle,
whatever.

1220
01:06:59.890 --> 01:07:03.340
And then you run into your friend from college who's in a band now and you're

1221
01:07:03.341 --> 01:07:05.440
like,
God dammit.
You know,

1222
01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:08.920
this mother fuckers out touring the world singing songs or like a professional

1223
01:07:08.921 --> 01:07:12.640
comedian or something.
Yeah.
One of those things.
Same Shit,
man.

1224
01:07:12.790 --> 01:07:16.250
I've never had a regular normal job.
Uh,
from the time I was,
uh,

1225
01:07:16.420 --> 01:07:20.860
out of high school,
it was never,
everything's been weird.
I had a job job,

1226
01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:23.190
you know,
teaching martial arts,
but it was never,
you know,

1227
01:07:23.230 --> 01:07:27.820
it was never in a cubicle or I had no possibilities,
cubicles or death,
man,

1228
01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:30.280
it wasn't gonna happen.
I was never going to be able to work in an office.

1229
01:07:30.281 --> 01:07:33.940
I never even thought it was ever a possibility.

1230
01:07:34.270 --> 01:07:35.290
Like when I was in high school,

1231
01:07:35.291 --> 01:07:38.560
my number one thing was I have to get the fuck out of here.

1232
01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:42.100
And then once I'm out of here,
now I can figure this out for myself.

1233
01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:46.570
But whatever it is that allows you to think that that's good and think that

1234
01:07:46.571 --> 01:07:49.720
that's preparing you for something that you actually want to do.
Ooh,

1235
01:07:49.810 --> 01:07:52.000
I got to not allow that in my brain.
Yeah.

1236
01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:55.230
I just knew that those people that were teaching those classes were so

1237
01:07:56.860 --> 01:07:57.700
public school.

1238
01:07:57.730 --> 01:08:02.230
The one good thing about it's sucking so hard is that it makes you analyze these

1239
01:08:02.231 --> 01:08:04.480
poor fucks that are teaching you.
You know,

1240
01:08:04.481 --> 01:08:09.250
if you have a really incompetent professor,
he makes you analyze like these,

1241
01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:14.280
these poor dummies that are no motivation and not getting paid well and they're

1242
01:08:14.321 --> 01:08:16.280
not good doing a job of it either.

1243
01:08:16.490 --> 01:08:18.260
<v 1>They're not,
they don't take any pride in their work.</v>

1244
01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:21.020
It's almost like if you wanted to go all Alex Jonesy,

1245
01:08:21.710 --> 01:08:24.650
it's almost like they designed it to make sure that there's a certain amount of

1246
01:08:24.651 --> 01:08:25.430
losers.

1247
01:08:25.430 --> 01:08:27.710
There's always going to be a certain amount of people that are willing to take

1248
01:08:27.711 --> 01:08:32.711
crappy jobs because they have no skills because it just made education really

1249
01:08:33.051 --> 01:08:34.480
fucking terrible.
Well,

1250
01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:39.590
there's a bunch of people go into teaching because they just generally genuinely

1251
01:08:39.591 --> 01:08:43.280
want to help kids and there they spend a lot of time getting certified,

1252
01:08:43.281 --> 01:08:47.000
especially here in California.
The certification process is crazy.

1253
01:08:47.090 --> 01:08:50.240
So they go to all this and what do they get as a reward for all their college

1254
01:08:50.241 --> 01:08:51.770
and all their extra training credentials.

1255
01:08:51.890 --> 01:08:55.010
They get a job that pays one like $30,000 a year with 42 kids in the room,

1256
01:08:55.011 --> 01:08:56.720
including some who have special needs,

1257
01:08:56.750 --> 01:08:59.720
who they just couldn't fit in the other classroom.
I volunteered,

1258
01:08:59.721 --> 01:09:04.430
I taught eighth graders for a couple of days using a junior achievement.

1259
01:09:04.431 --> 01:09:08.990
This nonprofit that lets like professional people come in and just like teach.

1260
01:09:09.530 --> 01:09:13.380
And I did this in a,
in East Palo Alto a while back,
which is a,

1261
01:09:13.381 --> 01:09:17.240
a really poor part of the bay area.
Like probably the poorest part of uh,

1262
01:09:17.241 --> 01:09:20.400
of the bay area around there.
It's like one side of the freeway,

1263
01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:24.530
Stanford University,
five and $10 million homes.
You go across the road,

1264
01:09:24.531 --> 01:09:28.240
there's dirt roads and like gunfire and it's literally the freeway cuts it down

1265
01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:31.130
the middle.
Yeah,
that's a weird area.
It is.

1266
01:09:31.131 --> 01:09:34.570
And so I'm there and I'm volunteering to teach in this class and I just remember

1267
01:09:34.571 --> 01:09:37.250
it.
I'm usually pretty good in front of a classroom.

1268
01:09:37.251 --> 01:09:38.660
I taught at the University of California,

1269
01:09:38.661 --> 01:09:42.590
so I'm a trained teacher and it was so hard because there were two kids there

1270
01:09:42.591 --> 01:09:45.140
who didn't belong in that class because their brains were tweaked.

1271
01:09:45.320 --> 01:09:48.980
Like they were seriously unable to hear the answer to the question,

1272
01:09:48.981 --> 01:09:50.420
so they would just interrupt constantly.

1273
01:09:50.750 --> 01:09:52.880
And I just looked at the rest of the kids there and they're just sitting there

1274
01:09:52.881 --> 01:09:55.760
kind of glazed over because they're getting nothing from this and I can talk to

1275
01:09:55.761 --> 01:09:58.250
the teacher afterwards and he's like,
there's nothing I can do.

1276
01:09:58.610 --> 01:10:01.670
And this guy was one of those really good,
just warm hearted,

1277
01:10:01.671 --> 01:10:03.530
nice guys who was teaching in a neighborhood.

1278
01:10:03.531 --> 01:10:05.810
He didn't have to teach him because that was where he could make the most good

1279
01:10:06.250 --> 01:10:09.440
and like we need to pay teachers more and we need to make public schools better.

1280
01:10:09.441 --> 01:10:12.290
That's one way to make the whole place more peaceful.
Yeah,

1281
01:10:12.291 --> 01:10:14.090
that's why I was saying it's almost Alex Jones.

1282
01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:17.480
It's like by charging or by paying them $35,000 a year,

1283
01:10:17.481 --> 01:10:20.990
you're ensuring they're going to suck at their job.
A good percentage of them.

1284
01:10:21.020 --> 01:10:22.010
And you'll drive away.

1285
01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:24.320
Some of the most passionate ones cause on top of that they have all the

1286
01:10:24.321 --> 01:10:28.380
bureaucracy and lawsuits and just riggermerall of working for you know,

1287
01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:31.070
kind of an ancient government.
And by actually clear about that,

1288
01:10:31.071 --> 01:10:36.071
I'm not actually implying that it is some sort of a conspiracy as to why the

1289
01:10:37.461 --> 01:10:40.490
schools suck.
I think it's simply a matter of they can get away with not paying.

1290
01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:44.120
I think they can cut resources in that area and then get away with it.

1291
01:10:44.150 --> 01:10:47.360
I think it's just one of those things that people cut and uh,

1292
01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:52.100
I think it's more of a,
an economic matter than anything.

1293
01:10:52.101 --> 01:10:53.810
I don't think it's a big grand conspiracy,

1294
01:10:53.811 --> 01:10:57.080
but that's one of the reasons why people do think it's a conspiracy.

1295
01:10:57.081 --> 01:11:00.620
I mean if you did want it to look at the effects of not having a properly

1296
01:11:00.621 --> 01:11:03.740
motivated group of teachers teaching children and that's the effects,

1297
01:11:03.741 --> 01:11:05.150
you have a terrible education.

1298
01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:09.830
And I looked at the cost of sending my kids in the bay area,
uh,

1299
01:11:10.130 --> 01:11:14.130
just to like kindergarten in a private mid tier school.

1300
01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:18.210
It was going to cost $40,000 a year for two kids post tax.
Like that's,

1301
01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:22.670
that's university level.
But that's because private lot of moles,

1302
01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:25.190
it was too much.
I don't know how to do that.
Um,

1303
01:11:25.350 --> 01:11:29.250
one of the things that led me to move to Canada where I live now was affordable

1304
01:11:29.251 --> 01:11:33.030
school and really good quality schools and you want to have that stable

1305
01:11:33.031 --> 01:11:35.820
community and you want to have like a sense of safety,

1306
01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:37.740
but you also want to have a sense of affordability.

1307
01:11:37.741 --> 01:11:42.741
So school is probably better quality than the one where my kids would have gone

1308
01:11:43.230 --> 01:11:47.370
in the bay area,
but it's 10% the cost.
Right.

1309
01:11:47.371 --> 01:11:51.090
Do they have to like drive and kilometers and shit?
That's a tough one for me.

1310
01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:51.993
With Celsius,

1311
01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:54.690
I just pretend like they're the same and I'm going faster than everyone else and

1312
01:11:54.691 --> 01:11:55.550
I think that's okay.
Right.

1313
01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:59.300
Is it a weird thing when you converted over when you went over there?

1314
01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:02.490
Like what about the money?
Did that freak you out?
It's almost exactly the same.

1315
01:12:02.491 --> 01:12:05.130
So it's just like these plastic things with pictures of English people,

1316
01:12:05.131 --> 01:12:07.920
even though it's Canada.
I never understood why they do that,
but it's colony.

1317
01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:13.080
So I just,
I found it was seamless.
I,
the only thing is the kilometers thing.

1318
01:12:13.081 --> 01:12:15.030
I truly haven't memorized that.

1319
01:12:15.031 --> 01:12:16.890
So I might have been pulled over once or twice a week.

1320
01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:18.630
Not because I was trying to go accessibly,

1321
01:12:18.631 --> 01:12:20.070
fastest because I wasn't paying attention.

1322
01:12:20.071 --> 01:12:22.410
And like 60 kilometers means nothing to my brain.

1323
01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:27.030
Did you have family in Canada or just in my father-in-laws uh,

1324
01:12:27.210 --> 01:12:31.450
is uh,
in Pemberton near Whistler.
Yeah.
So a good place to go hunting.
Yeah.

1325
01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:34.470
It's a nice area,
man.
That whole Vancouver area is very nice.

1326
01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:36.810
Real estate is fucking stupid expensive though.

1327
01:12:36.930 --> 01:12:39.870
It is on the mainland where I live on the island,

1328
01:12:39.900 --> 01:12:44.280
it's pretty affordable and oh yeah.
I fucking bears on an island.

1329
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:46.470
We do have bears on the island.
Grizzly bears,

1330
01:12:46.471 --> 01:12:49.680
black bears and grizzlies just emigrated.
They swam across some straight.

1331
01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:54.070
So there was one in my backyard not that long ago.
A grizzly,
no,
a blackberry.

1332
01:12:54.090 --> 01:12:57.420
I told the kids don't play in the forest and why not?
Well,

1333
01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:59.280
because of the bears will eat you.
And I was serious.

1334
01:12:59.610 --> 01:13:02.680
I don't think they believed me,
but wow.
And then they saw a bear.
Yeah,

1335
01:13:02.690 --> 01:13:03.780
it was literally in our backyard.

1336
01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:07.350
How old were your kids when you moved into Canada?
Uh,
let's see.

1337
01:13:08.130 --> 01:13:12.750
My daughter must have been about two,
maybe three.
And my son was about one.

1338
01:13:12.990 --> 01:13:15.720
Okay.
So they didn't really,
they don't really remember the United States.

1339
01:13:15.721 --> 01:13:16.280
Not much.

1340
01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:19.140
So you brought him to a godforsaken land before they really had any memory of

1341
01:13:19.141 --> 01:13:22.200
how good they had it.
We go back down,
we visit relatives and all that,

1342
01:13:22.201 --> 01:13:23.490
but it's one of those things where I,

1343
01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:26.660
I have so many friends all over the u s and,
and I,

1344
01:13:26.670 --> 01:13:28.840
I'm really attracted to the bay area,
just there.

1345
01:13:28.850 --> 01:13:32.250
There's so much of what I do is there,
and I'm a tech guy,
you know,

1346
01:13:32.251 --> 01:13:34.890
I've been a tech entrepreneur and my kind of,

1347
01:13:35.010 --> 01:13:38.340
my people are there at the same time with Skype and with the Internet and two

1348
01:13:38.341 --> 01:13:41.100
hour direct flight.
It's,
you can live anywhere you want.
You can live in Idaho,

1349
01:13:41.101 --> 01:13:42.860
John.
And you could still even have your studio here.

1350
01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:46.490
Just come here and do it and fly back.
It's,
yeah.
Yeah,
you can.

1351
01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:48.130
It's a weird world we live in now.

1352
01:13:48.131 --> 01:13:51.450
And Terence Mckenna was actually pointing this out way back in the 90s,

1353
01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:55.920
and he was living on the big island.
He had a direct wireless connection,

1354
01:13:56.040 --> 01:14:00.600
like a wireless Internet connection that was like one megabyte back then,

1355
01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:05.100
which is,
you know,
a lot.
Yeah.
Back then it was huge.
It was in the 90s.

1356
01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:09.840
And uh,
he had this like completely off the grid house,

1357
01:14:09.870 --> 01:14:13.990
including an Internet connection and it's Internet connection.
He had a like,

1358
01:14:14.190 --> 01:14:18.340
yeah,
it's some solar panels.
He had a generator backup yet.
Wow.

1359
01:14:18.370 --> 01:14:20.950
Rainwater collecting,
cause he reigns over there.

1360
01:14:20.951 --> 01:14:24.940
It's essentially a tropical rain forest,
you know,
the,
uh,
the big island.

1361
01:14:25.210 --> 01:14:27.940
And so he was collecting rainwater and you know,
he's like,

1362
01:14:27.941 --> 01:14:30.340
why would you live in an office?
I mean,
why would you go to an office?

1363
01:14:30.341 --> 01:14:33.360
What would you live in a city?
Why would you do that when you can,
you can be in,

1364
01:14:33.361 --> 01:14:38.180
in nature and still be,
you know,
still communicate with people.
Just one,

1365
01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:40.720
one word girls.
That's true.

1366
01:14:40.810 --> 01:14:44.180
Like if you want to meet people of the opposite sex cities have,
have their,

1367
01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:45.970
their usefulness.
So when you,
when you're young,

1368
01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:50.530
I think there's a big attractiveness to the cities and I've been fortunate to

1369
01:14:50.531 --> 01:14:53.620
live in big cities and you know,
to have that vibe and that energy,

1370
01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:56.530
big difference.
It is a big difference.
But numbers.
Yeah.

1371
01:14:56.531 --> 01:15:00.100
I think when you're like a tiny little baby and like a two year old cities are

1372
01:15:00.101 --> 01:15:02.410
probably not that good for you.
So that's one of the reasons I am like,
all right,

1373
01:15:02.770 --> 01:15:04.510
you know,
I,
I'm going to maintain my,

1374
01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:08.140
my connections with all my friends and I spend a lot of time traveling and all.

1375
01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:10.990
Uh,
but at the same time I know like when I go home and Kinda,

1376
01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:14.920
there's trees and everything.
Yeah,
no,
it's,
it's a sweet set up.

1377
01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:16.570
That island is beautiful.

1378
01:15:17.050 --> 01:15:21.490
And if you can live anywhere where you can get close to nature fairly quickly,

1379
01:15:21.520 --> 01:15:25.090
it'll be a better place to live.
Yeah.
The problem is if everyone does that,

1380
01:15:25.091 --> 01:15:27.100
we're going to have to rethink how we produce our food.

1381
01:15:27.101 --> 01:15:28.870
We're going to have to distribute food production.

1382
01:15:28.871 --> 01:15:31.060
And we're going to have to make some changes,

1383
01:15:31.061 --> 01:15:34.390
but things would be kind of cool and we might drive less too because we would

1384
01:15:34.391 --> 01:15:36.880
just have to work from home and let's face it,

1385
01:15:36.881 --> 01:15:40.210
how many people are knowledge workers in the u s now versus production workers?

1386
01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:44.620
Yeah,
there's not that much commuting you have to do for probably 50% of the

1387
01:15:44.621 --> 01:15:45.454
population.

1388
01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:50.080
The areas of mass population or the weirdest ones,

1389
01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:52.540
the areas like Los Angeles or New York.

1390
01:15:52.541 --> 01:15:56.020
Those are the weirdest things to try to manage because you see them and you see

1391
01:15:56.021 --> 01:16:00.690
all these people packed into this area and you just go,
what you're,

1392
01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:02.590
there's no way you're going to be able to move around quickly.

1393
01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:05.560
There's no way you're going to get into midtown Manhattan at four o'clock in the

1394
01:16:05.561 --> 01:16:08.560
afternoon,
shoot across town to the other side to meet your friend.

1395
01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:11.410
You're not going to get there.
There's just too many folks there.

1396
01:16:11.411 --> 01:16:16.411
Just too many folks and everyone's just jammed into this one fucking tube.

1397
01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:19.720
It's just not going to happen.
That's,

1398
01:16:19.721 --> 01:16:22.060
I don't know how that is ever going to get managed.

1399
01:16:22.061 --> 01:16:25.840
And it seems like New York City grows in population every year.

1400
01:16:25.870 --> 01:16:30.510
Los Angeles grows in population every year.
I love New York.
I love La.
I like it.

1401
01:16:30.511 --> 01:16:34.980
It's,
it's awesome to come and visit.
And even San Francisco,
I just,
uh,

1402
01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:37.990
having lived in cities like that for awhile,
I,

1403
01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:42.830
I'm kind of getting used to just being outdoors a lot.
Yeah.
And Healthier.
It's a,

1404
01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:45.880
it's a big difference.
And I don't know that I'll stay in,
you know,

1405
01:16:45.940 --> 01:16:48.640
in a smaller town for a long time,
but at least when my kids are young,

1406
01:16:48.641 --> 01:16:51.790
I think it's good for them until you get attacked by a bear and then,
you know,

1407
01:16:51.791 --> 01:16:55.450
like,
uh,
you know what?
This ain't good.

1408
01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:59.690
There's a wash show that I've been watching that on.
It's a,

1409
01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:04.210
I think it's on the discovery channel.
It's called,
um,
uh,
life below zero.

1410
01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:08.200
I haven't seen that.
Oh,
these poor fox,
they're all living in Alaska.

1411
01:17:08.230 --> 01:17:12.140
It's so crazy for those show Motown people who like have to catch enough fish or

1412
01:17:12.141 --> 01:17:13.660
they starve those,

1413
01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:18.700
<v 0>that's a Alaska the last frontier against one of them.
But this is a new one.</v>

1414
01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:22.810
It's all people that live either above or below the Arctic circle and like this

1415
01:17:22.811 --> 01:17:26.730
one guy just has this little cabin and just hunts all day.
It's all does,

1416
01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:29.950
it goes out and tries to find food,
brings it back,
kills it and eats it.

1417
01:17:29.951 --> 01:17:33.190
And then in the morning does it all again and he has no water.

1418
01:17:33.191 --> 01:17:34.960
No not he gets his water from a lake.

1419
01:17:35.310 --> 01:17:39.010
He has to like chip into the ice to water out.
I mean,

1420
01:17:39.550 --> 01:17:43.810
it's crazy.
These,
these poor fucking people,
but they all,

1421
01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:46.660
they all seem to have a good time doing that.
It's real weird.

1422
01:17:46.661 --> 01:17:47.500
It's hard to tell like,

1423
01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:49.900
are you guys having a good time because the camera's on you.

1424
01:17:50.140 --> 01:17:54.910
Are you having a good time?
Because this is actually thrilling and rewarding.
Uh,

1425
01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:56.890
a thrilling and rewarding way to live life.

1426
01:17:57.510 --> 01:18:01.100
<v 1>I knew a guy like that up in Kenai,
Alaska.
His name is George.</v>

1427
01:18:01.101 --> 01:18:04.610
He's got was 84 years old when I went up,
I spent a week fishing with him.

1428
01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:09.880
He owned this hundred year old cannery like right on Cook's cove and you had to

1429
01:18:10.161 --> 01:18:13.850
get there by boat so it was totally isolated and once a week for like a half

1430
01:18:13.850 --> 01:18:13.851
hour,

1431
01:18:13.851 --> 01:18:17.510
he would plug this string of duct tape batteries into his mobile phone and that

1432
01:18:17.511 --> 01:18:20.030
was his only communication with people.
Wow.

1433
01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:23.900
And this guy had been going up there every year and spending nine months a year

1434
01:18:23.930 --> 01:18:28.790
for 50 years living by himself up there.
And I was happy as a clam.

1435
01:18:28.791 --> 01:18:31.830
Like you had a pet bald eagle and named GRANDPA and he'd like feed it fish
crabs.

1436
01:18:31.831 --> 01:18:34.700
You could call it by name and it would come.
Was there a documentary on this guy?

1437
01:18:34.730 --> 01:18:38.380
I don't think so,
no.
He passed away about five years ago and it was George.
Yeah,

1438
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:41.840
George God.
What was his last name?
I'd have to look it up somewhere.

1439
01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:45.510
<v 0>See the problem I have with that story is that the guy was by himself.</v>

1440
01:18:45.870 --> 01:18:47.430
Like you don't get lonely.

1441
01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:51.050
<v 1>He had a wife who passed away 30 years earlier and you know,</v>

1442
01:18:51.070 --> 01:18:55.430
he was one of the original Alaska,
like,
like original guys who drove to Alaska,

1443
01:18:55.460 --> 01:19:00.290
like back in the 1920s or something.
And uh,
had all these stories and,

1444
01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:04.760
and just,
just an amazing dude,
but he was really comfortable.
Like he caught fish.

1445
01:19:04.761 --> 01:19:07.910
That's what he did.
He had like a big net and in fact he had a,

1446
01:19:07.911 --> 01:19:11.330
Rolex is probably the coolest story ever.
I looked at him and I'm like,

1447
01:19:11.331 --> 01:19:11.870
he's kind of,

1448
01:19:11.870 --> 01:19:16.070
this poor guy looked like he was 60 and he was 84 and where's this yellow cover

1449
01:19:16.071 --> 01:19:16.904
all things.

1450
01:19:17.200 --> 01:19:20.900
And I see this beat up Rolex and I did a double take and he laughed and he goes,

1451
01:19:20.901 --> 01:19:23.060
Oh yeah,
I called the Rolex guy,
told him I want a Rolex.

1452
01:19:23.090 --> 01:19:27.530
We flew out here in a plane and he stepped out and you know,
three piece suit,

1453
01:19:27.531 --> 01:19:27.681
you know,

1454
01:19:27.681 --> 01:19:31.520
into the surf you from the float plane and took one look at me wearing my fish

1455
01:19:31.521 --> 01:19:34.550
guts and on and said,
oh,
I'm sorry sir.
You know,
you're,

1456
01:19:34.551 --> 01:19:38.600
you're not a Rolex kind of guy.
And George looks at me.
He goes,
Dave,
I told them,

1457
01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:40.730
oh,
I just need that watch for work.
I already got a dress.

1458
01:19:40.731 --> 01:19:44.570
Watch you one of the galaxy that was gas charge so it wouldn't fog up.

1459
01:19:44.571 --> 01:19:47.690
So he wouldn't get caught in the tide and drowned and like the way these people

1460
01:19:47.691 --> 01:19:52.160
look at the world,
it was so cool.
Like,
wait a minute,
a Rolex guy flew out there.

1461
01:19:52.170 --> 01:19:55.760
Yeah.
And how did even contact Rolex?
You know,

1462
01:19:55.940 --> 01:19:57.980
he was telling me the story from 25 years before.

1463
01:19:57.981 --> 01:20:00.740
So really if you're going to drop 10 K on a watch 30 years ago,

1464
01:20:00.770 --> 01:20:03.170
they're going to fly someone there to sell it to you.
So the dude,

1465
01:20:03.171 --> 01:20:06.500
where do you get the 10 k from beaver pelts and shit?
Nah,
for selling fish.

1466
01:20:06.790 --> 01:20:09.390
Stealing.
Yeah.
He had a great year catching king salmon.

1467
01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:12.050
He had a drift net across like the mouth of a river.

1468
01:20:12.051 --> 01:20:14.280
He decided to buy a $10,000 watch.

1469
01:20:14.310 --> 01:20:18.780
His rationale was it was the only watch on earth that had gas inside it so it

1470
01:20:18.781 --> 01:20:20.670
could never fog up.
And he's like,

1471
01:20:20.671 --> 01:20:23.430
if I'm out on the mudflats planning my things and the tide comes in,

1472
01:20:23.431 --> 01:20:27.360
it comes in like really fast and you have like sticky mud so you can freeze to

1473
01:20:27.361 --> 01:20:28.860
death in like a minute.
So he was like,

1474
01:20:28.861 --> 01:20:31.320
I got to know what time the tide is coming in so I'll spend any amount on the

1475
01:20:31.321 --> 01:20:34.230
watch to keep you from dying.
And Rolex was the only one on earth at the time.

1476
01:20:34.410 --> 01:20:36.930
Wow,
that's interesting.
Does is it,

1477
01:20:36.931 --> 01:20:39.990
it's still the only one or can you get out and like everyone makes watches and

1478
01:20:39.991 --> 01:20:44.070
no fog up anymore.
I mean this is going back.
This guy's old.
That's fascinating.

1479
01:20:44.071 --> 01:20:46.860
Shit.
That's interesting that he knew that too,

1480
01:20:46.861 --> 01:20:49.320
that that was the only watch that doesn't fog up like that.

1481
01:20:49.380 --> 01:20:53.130
I guess when you live up in places like that you just learn stuff.
I just,

1482
01:20:53.131 --> 01:20:56.520
it just seems to me that like living on your own for nine months at a time,

1483
01:20:56.521 --> 01:20:58.080
which just drive you insane.
Well,

1484
01:20:58.081 --> 01:21:00.870
he had people who'd come up and visit him so he'd get like college kids to come

1485
01:21:00.871 --> 01:21:04.830
up and he just kind of had like this rotating hunters and all would come and it

1486
01:21:04.831 --> 01:21:05.850
was,
I mean rustic.

1487
01:21:05.851 --> 01:21:09.240
The only water came in from like a little waterfall with a little pipe and it

1488
01:21:09.241 --> 01:21:12.080
was heated by like coal that floated up on the shore.
It was as,

1489
01:21:12.170 --> 01:21:13.710
as remote as I've ever been.

1490
01:21:14.010 --> 01:21:18.570
And this guy was just like one of the happiest guys I've seen.
Wow.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1491
01:21:18.571 --> 01:21:22.290
They say that people that live in those communities and they're living off the

1492
01:21:22.291 --> 01:21:25.380
land,
the say like the happiest people know mental health issues,

1493
01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:30.150
that that's the way our are dumb bodies are designed or dumb Bot is designed to

1494
01:21:30.151 --> 01:21:34.710
live as our ancestors lived and this life that we live now with Wifi connections

1495
01:21:34.711 --> 01:21:38.790
and all this nuttiness it's just too fucking complicated for us.
You know,

1496
01:21:38.850 --> 01:21:42.960
I asked on Facebook,
uh,
I said,
hey,
I'm going to go talk with Joe,

1497
01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:46.290
which we talk about and definitely got some people asking about EMF.

1498
01:21:46.330 --> 01:21:47.760
You talk about Wifi.
I mean,

1499
01:21:47.761 --> 01:21:51.270
this is one of those guys who had 10 minutes of Wifi a week and that was all he

1500
01:21:51.271 --> 01:21:55.470
ever got and you know,
ate a High Omega three,
you know,

1501
01:21:55.530 --> 01:21:57.630
all the salmon he could eat and not much else.

1502
01:21:58.020 --> 01:22:00.120
And he was also doing cold thermogenesis,
right?

1503
01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:03.870
So he was literally exposing himself to freezing temperatures all the time.

1504
01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:05.760
And he looked 25 years younger than he was.

1505
01:22:05.761 --> 01:22:09.650
He was like not a day over 60 and he was 84 years old when I hang out in

1506
01:22:09.660 --> 01:22:13.860
temperatures are good for you.
Yeah.
So like living in Colorado be a good move.

1507
01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:15.870
It depends if you go outside without a jacket on.

1508
01:22:16.170 --> 01:22:19.780
So if you went outside without a jacket in Colorado at smart deserving you.
Yeah,

1509
01:22:19.781 --> 01:22:20.614
that's pretty much it.

1510
01:22:20.640 --> 01:22:25.640
So I did this experiment about a year and a half ago and for the first month you

1511
01:22:25.921 --> 01:22:28.920
stick your face in ice water and it hurts like hell when you first do it.

1512
01:22:28.921 --> 01:22:32.250
But you need to do that to program your nervous system to get used to being in

1513
01:22:32.251 --> 01:22:35.610
cold water.
And it turns off inflammation throughout your body.

1514
01:22:35.611 --> 01:22:37.290
And after you've done this for about a month,

1515
01:22:37.320 --> 01:22:41.850
you can put ice packs on your body and then this drives you to lose fat and

1516
01:22:41.851 --> 01:22:43.170
makes you make more brown fat,

1517
01:22:43.171 --> 01:22:47.010
less white fat and inflammation really turns down in like kind of a stupid way.

1518
01:22:47.010 --> 01:22:50.820
You feel really like supercharged and you get lean at Tim Ferriss wrote about

1519
01:22:50.821 --> 01:22:54.630
just like putting ice packs on your back but you can take it further.

1520
01:22:54.631 --> 01:22:57.420
So I was sitting in a tub of ice water,

1521
01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:01.380
like up to my neck and it feels like you're going to die for about three minutes

1522
01:23:01.710 --> 01:23:02.491
and then all of a sudden you're,

1523
01:23:02.491 --> 01:23:05.160
your whole body like gives up and you just like get all these endorphins.

1524
01:23:05.290 --> 01:23:09.550
You just feel like amazing and relaxed and right when you're about to start

1525
01:23:09.551 --> 01:23:09.881
shivering,

1526
01:23:09.881 --> 01:23:13.960
you get out and you just burn massive calories and like you look better the next

1527
01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:15.190
morning,
like you're,
you're more lean.

1528
01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:18.610
And so I did that on a really regular basis for quite a while,

1529
01:23:18.611 --> 01:23:21.250
but I'm on the road so much that it's just,
it's hard to do.

1530
01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:25.060
And I fell asleep with ice packs on me in a hotel room once and that didn't end

1531
01:23:25.061 --> 01:23:28.240
well.
I ended up getting like first degree ice burns over 15% of my body.

1532
01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:30.130
Well I don't recommend that that was,

1533
01:23:30.450 --> 01:23:34.510
there's a lot of cold therapy that athletes are using now to help recover things

1534
01:23:34.511 --> 01:23:37.980
they step into for a very brief amount of time.
It's incredibly cold.

1535
01:23:38.230 --> 01:23:39.490
I can't wait to try that.

1536
01:23:39.580 --> 01:23:44.140
It turns out that we've done the science and the faster you can make the skin

1537
01:23:44.141 --> 01:23:47.020
cold the better the anti inflammatory response.

1538
01:23:47.170 --> 01:23:50.140
So they have like liquid nitrogen and they're like blast you with it for just a

1539
01:23:50.141 --> 01:23:54.310
very short period of time and the skin starts making the anti inflammatory

1540
01:23:54.311 --> 01:23:57.580
things and you get the response you're looking for but it doesn't take much time

1541
01:23:57.581 --> 01:23:59.500
and you don't like freeze your ass off like you do.

1542
01:23:59.501 --> 01:24:01.510
When I'm sitting in that tub of ice water,

1543
01:24:01.630 --> 01:24:05.050
just dropping my body temperature till my skin is like 45 degrees and you'd get

1544
01:24:05.051 --> 01:24:09.670
out.
And so when you do that,
like you,
you do an ice bath after hard training.

1545
01:24:09.671 --> 01:24:13.930
A lot of MMA fighters love to do that.
What's the physiological response?

1546
01:24:13.931 --> 01:24:17.110
What happens when you jump into that freezing cold water?

1547
01:24:17.111 --> 01:24:20.410
What's the benefit of that?
You turned down the cytokine response.

1548
01:24:20.411 --> 01:24:23.440
So there's all these different cytokines that are tied to inflammation in the

1549
01:24:23.441 --> 01:24:25.150
body and when you do that,

1550
01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:29.680
it uses what's probably an evolutionary pathway for survival in people.

1551
01:24:29.780 --> 01:24:32.890
I don't think we're certain why it works.
That's one hypothesis about it.

1552
01:24:33.250 --> 01:24:35.710
But when you do that,
it just turns off inflammation.

1553
01:24:35.711 --> 01:24:38.530
So if you had a really heavy workout or hard fight and you do that,

1554
01:24:38.800 --> 01:24:43.420
it stops the inflammation.
And like you said earlier in our talk today,

1555
01:24:44.090 --> 01:24:47.320
inflammation is that the root of most chronic diseases,

1556
01:24:47.321 --> 01:24:49.870
and that's why you target inflammation every which way you can.

1557
01:24:49.870 --> 01:24:53.610
And cold therapy if you've got the time to do it,
is a,

1558
01:24:53.670 --> 01:24:57.460
is a very legitimate thing to do.
The problem is that fast cold therapy thing,

1559
01:24:57.490 --> 01:24:58.330
I just checked it.

1560
01:24:58.340 --> 01:25:01.450
They're like $60,000 it's like more than a really high end float tank.

1561
01:25:01.630 --> 01:25:04.990
So if you want to like outfit your house with like all the bad ass biohacking

1562
01:25:04.991 --> 01:25:06.580
stuff,
you're going to be thrown out some coin.

1563
01:25:06.581 --> 01:25:10.960
Like I couldn't afford the holy shit.
Yeah.
What does it do?

1564
01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:12.730
It's just a super freezer.

1565
01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.490
It's pretty much like you want to see it with liquid nitrogen.
It's not liquid.

1566
01:25:15.530 --> 01:25:18.370
It's gasp.
It's super chilled air.
Like really cold,

1567
01:25:18.371 --> 01:25:20.500
cold enough that if you stayed in it for a minute or two,

1568
01:25:20.501 --> 01:25:24.250
however long is too long,
it would give you frostbite.
Wow.

1569
01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:27.720
So you want to tell your body frostbite is coming and it causes a physical or

1570
01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:28.960
physiological change,

1571
01:25:29.290 --> 01:25:32.290
but then you don't let the frostbite comes so then you don't get the damage that

1572
01:25:32.291 --> 01:25:36.710
would come from being too cold.
Wow,
that's fascinating.
Um,

1573
01:25:36.760 --> 01:25:39.550
is it better than lying in an ice bath?

1574
01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:42.130
I don't know that I have an answer for that.

1575
01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:46.060
There's deep tissue temperature receptor's and then there's peripheral ones

1576
01:25:46.061 --> 01:25:46.894
right on the skin.

1577
01:25:47.320 --> 01:25:50.880
So whether there's an advantage from just getting the skin ones or the ones like

1578
01:25:50.950 --> 01:25:54.670
further down.
I've never seen the research.
Someone might know.

1579
01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.430
I just chatted with Jack Kruse,

1580
01:25:57.490 --> 01:26:00.570
who is one of the neurosurgeons who's done a lot of work on this,
uh,

1581
01:26:00.580 --> 01:26:04.130
including like surgery without anesthetics afterwards,
painkillers

1582
01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:08.000
<v 4>using just ice and all this crazy stuff including like massive weight loss with</v>

1583
01:26:08.001 --> 01:26:11.570
eyes.
Wow.
So there's definitely guys who know about that.

1584
01:26:11.571 --> 01:26:14.930
But in all the research I've seen,
uh,
and other people I've talked to,

1585
01:26:14.931 --> 01:26:18.140
I've never seen a comparison of the two techniques other than one is faster and,

1586
01:26:18.141 --> 01:26:19.730
and it costs more,
but it takes less time.

1587
01:26:19.970 --> 01:26:23.480
<v 0>It's very confusing for athletes when you hear all the different schools of</v>

1588
01:26:23.481 --> 01:26:25.540
thought when it comes to healing.
Like some there,

1589
01:26:25.570 --> 01:26:28.670
I mean I've actually heard people say you should never ice things cause then you

1590
01:26:28.671 --> 01:26:29.261
know,
the,

1591
01:26:29.261 --> 01:26:34.261
the body's natural healing is s is retarded by the ice and then you,

1592
01:26:35.150 --> 01:26:37.640
when you're,
your body's swelling up and heating up,

1593
01:26:37.850 --> 01:26:40.970
it's because your body is trying to fix whatever issue it has.
I don't,

1594
01:26:41.030 --> 01:26:44.770
I don't buy that because I've heard all the arguments against that.
But I've,
um,

1595
01:26:44.870 --> 01:26:49.850
I'm fascinated by the fact that there's people who are quote unquote experts or

1596
01:26:49.851 --> 01:26:51.290
so called expert would tell you that.

1597
01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:54.020
And there's other people that will tell you the total opposite of that.

1598
01:26:54.400 --> 01:26:57.340
<v 4>That's why being a human Guinea pig and this whole quantified self thing really</v>

1599
01:26:57.341 --> 01:26:58.174
matters.

1600
01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:01.790
There's a lot of stuff that makes a lot of sense on its face and you look at it

1601
01:27:01.820 --> 01:27:03.820
go,
oh,
it must make sense.
Therefore it is.

1602
01:27:04.090 --> 01:27:08.140
And like the whole thing about eat less calories and work out more and you'll

1603
01:27:08.141 --> 01:27:12.070
lose weight in a safe way and keep it off.
Well it makes sense.

1604
01:27:12.071 --> 01:27:13.030
It just doesn't work.

1605
01:27:13.360 --> 01:27:16.840
And if you try it and you lose 25 pounds and gain 30 and there's 30 pounds and

1606
01:27:16.841 --> 01:27:19.420
gained 40 and you do that over and over until you're a fat ass,

1607
01:27:19.690 --> 01:27:23.320
at one point you're going to figure out that that is not a way to be healthy and

1608
01:27:23.321 --> 01:27:25.240
thin and strong and to feel good.

1609
01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:28.510
But the problem is not that people are idiots.

1610
01:27:28.540 --> 01:27:30.100
It's that the assumption made a lot of sense.

1611
01:27:30.130 --> 01:27:33.100
So then it becomes dogma and instead of looking at the data,

1612
01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:36.070
we look at what should work and then if it didn't work it's because we didn't do

1613
01:27:36.071 --> 01:27:38.460
it right or we didn't try hard enough and it,

1614
01:27:38.470 --> 01:27:41.650
that little trap gets us all kinds of things that seemed like a good idea on

1615
01:27:41.651 --> 01:27:44.680
their face.
And I'd even say like the whole vegan approach,

1616
01:27:44.910 --> 01:27:49.270
like it sounds like a good idea to be a Ravi again cause you get enzymes and you

1617
01:27:49.271 --> 01:27:52.270
get all these other things.
But I know a lot of people who've got really sick,

1618
01:27:52.271 --> 01:27:55.810
including me from being a raw vegan because of the anti nutrients that were in

1619
01:27:55.840 --> 01:27:56.740
the raw vegetables.

1620
01:27:56.741 --> 01:28:00.070
We were reading like we didn't inactivate the vegetable defense systems.

1621
01:28:00.490 --> 01:28:04.690
So it's great to have a hypothesis and to test it.
But if you don't get the data,

1622
01:28:04.691 --> 01:28:07.090
you don't look at how you're doing and see if it worked,

1623
01:28:07.510 --> 01:28:09.400
then I mean if you're a pro athlete or not,

1624
01:28:09.910 --> 01:28:11.530
especially then you should be getting the numbers.

1625
01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:15.200
<v 0>Yeah.
It's one of the more fascinating aspects of this,
uh,
of,</v>

1626
01:28:15.201 --> 01:28:16.910
of professional athletics.

1627
01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:22.270
Even if you're not into watching sports is the leaps and bounds they're making

1628
01:28:22.550 --> 01:28:26.970
as far as recovery and nutrition and finding out what helps the body perform a

1629
01:28:26.971 --> 01:28:29.710
certain way.
And by doing that,
you know,
it's,

1630
01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:33.170
it's sort of just like the trickle down that you get from cars,

1631
01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:36.620
car companies investing in race cars and then,
you know,

1632
01:28:36.630 --> 01:28:40.130
they develop better brakes for commercial vehicles,
for commercial cars,

1633
01:28:40.340 --> 01:28:45.340
for pedestrian or rather I'm a civilian cars is as opposed to the,

1634
01:28:45.561 --> 01:28:47.420
uh,
the professional race car driver cars.

1635
01:28:47.690 --> 01:28:52.340
But those like really high level engineered cars,
whether it's BMW or a Porsche,

1636
01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:56.720
like all that stuff trickles down to the regular cars that consumers buy.

1637
01:28:57.130 --> 01:29:00.790
<v 4>I kind of liked it when you had victor content on because when I look at the pro</v>

1638
01:29:00.791 --> 01:29:04.320
athletes who are cheating,
like I want to know what they're doing,

1639
01:29:04.321 --> 01:29:06.930
I'd rather that they weren't cheating.
I'd rather that they were,
you know,

1640
01:29:06.940 --> 01:29:10.380
free to tell people the techniques that we're doing because it seems like the

1641
01:29:10.381 --> 01:29:13.410
techniques that we're using at the very edges of human performance,

1642
01:29:13.411 --> 01:29:14.850
whether it's military or pro athletes,

1643
01:29:15.150 --> 01:29:19.470
that those should be trickling through into the medical profession and we have

1644
01:29:19.471 --> 01:29:20.131
like a break.

1645
01:29:20.131 --> 01:29:23.160
There were a lot of times what they're doing is kind of like hidden or it's not

1646
01:29:23.161 --> 01:29:23.880
talked about.

1647
01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:27.780
But rapid recovery for a pro athlete ought to be able to make my grandmother

1648
01:29:27.781 --> 01:29:30.420
heal better too.
And yeah,
I felt like she isn't benefiting.

1649
01:29:30.930 --> 01:29:33.870
<v 0>Absolutely.
And the injuries,
you know,
injuries that athletes get,</v>

1650
01:29:33.900 --> 01:29:35.330
regular people get injuries to the,

1651
01:29:35.540 --> 01:29:40.320
the leaps and bounds they've made and recognizing what benefits,
recovery,

1652
01:29:40.321 --> 01:29:43.860
what doesn't die at that benefits recovery,
what nutrients you need,

1653
01:29:43.861 --> 01:29:47.340
what will you know,
how,
how much,
how important is protein?

1654
01:29:47.341 --> 01:29:51.840
How important or is this,
what vitamins are good for you,
what you know,
all that.

1655
01:29:51.870 --> 01:29:56.130
A lot of that is coming from that science of performance athletics because

1656
01:29:56.490 --> 01:29:59.460
they're just looking for these tiny,
tiny edges everywhere.

1657
01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:03.390
And there's these benefits are so small,
like the wood,

1658
01:30:03.391 --> 01:30:06.630
the what you can get out of like taking cordyceps mushroom or what do you can

1659
01:30:06.631 --> 01:30:10.860
get at B12 or it's not going to make the difference between a guy like you or a

1660
01:30:10.861 --> 01:30:14.450
guy like Hussein bolt.
You know,
you're never going to catch that dude.
You know,

1661
01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:16.070
I'm not going to happen,
but it's going to be too.

1662
01:30:16.071 --> 01:30:20.070
He seen bolts and one of them just once to get a 10th of a second faster.

1663
01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:22.200
And in those small increments,

1664
01:30:22.201 --> 01:30:24.600
that's where we learned so much about the human body.

1665
01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:29.530
<v 4>You know where else is fascinating for me is a world championship poker.
Uh,</v>

1666
01:30:29.550 --> 01:30:32.600
because those guys,
it's all about focus and awareness,
right?

1667
01:30:32.630 --> 01:30:35.190
You've got to pay attention to all the other guys at the table.
All their tells,

1668
01:30:35.191 --> 01:30:38.370
all the things you've got to think strategy and you've gotta just grind it out.

1669
01:30:38.371 --> 01:30:41.910
It's like a marathon for your brain.
It's like they're going for 12 and 14 hours.

1670
01:30:42.390 --> 01:30:43.830
Um,
and uh,

1671
01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:48.480
I just literally got a text message before this but a JC trend who's in the

1672
01:30:48.481 --> 01:30:52.800
world poker championships I think like actually happening right after this.
Uh,

1673
01:30:52.920 --> 01:30:55.740
he's totally on bulletproof coffee and uh,

1674
01:30:55.741 --> 01:30:58.130
so it was one of the other guys but JC is actually,
um,

1675
01:30:58.440 --> 01:31:01.100
I just literally found out he's going to be wearing a bulletproof patch and I'm

1676
01:31:01.101 --> 01:31:03.510
like,
like grateful for that because it wasn't planned.

1677
01:31:04.170 --> 01:31:08.660
I was going to do it every time he said bulletproof makeup.
Bell noise.
Yeah.

1678
01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:12.180
Doorbell.
No.
So for bulletproof but it's a,

1679
01:31:12.181 --> 01:31:15.540
it's one of those things where I look at those guys and I've actually done brain

1680
01:31:15.541 --> 01:31:16.071
training with,

1681
01:31:16.071 --> 01:31:20.460
with [inaudible] who's another one of these guys and there are some of the most

1682
01:31:20.461 --> 01:31:24.270
dedicated cognitive athletes have anyone I can find like you have students in

1683
01:31:24.271 --> 01:31:25.740
all but that's not the same thing.

1684
01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:29.570
Like where do you go to get the pro athlete perspective on,

1685
01:31:29.820 --> 01:31:31.020
on performance improvement.

1686
01:31:31.050 --> 01:31:34.230
But to get it for people who want to like pay attention all the time and like

1687
01:31:34.231 --> 01:31:35.760
think about stuff all the time.
And I don't know,

1688
01:31:35.820 --> 01:31:38.430
is there a better place you can think of that pro poker?

1689
01:31:38.770 --> 01:31:40.480
<v 0>No,
I think those guys are probably,</v>

1690
01:31:40.481 --> 01:31:45.460
if you want someone who's job relies on being clever and thinking many levels.

1691
01:31:46.000 --> 01:31:50.280
Pro Chess.
Oh yeah.
The only other people I got to find some chess.
What,

1692
01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:54.710
what studies have ever been done or,
uh,
have there been any done that,
uh,

1693
01:31:54.940 --> 01:31:59.170
has anybody even personal studies,
um,
with a bulletproof coffee,

1694
01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:00.220
cognition

1695
01:32:00.220 --> 01:32:04.240
<v 1>or anything along those lines?
So there's a study and a,</v>

1696
01:32:04.241 --> 01:32:06.460
I think my guys are probably ready to put up,
uh,
uh,

1697
01:32:06.610 --> 01:32:10.600
the summary Graph from it where we recruited 54 people.

1698
01:32:10.601 --> 01:32:14.320
We got an institutional review board approval for the study,

1699
01:32:14.530 --> 01:32:16.690
like basically from the powers that be,

1700
01:32:16.691 --> 01:32:18.430
that say you're allowed to experiment on humans.

1701
01:32:18.850 --> 01:32:21.670
And we had them go through a period of drinking,

1702
01:32:22.030 --> 01:32:26.860
basically mass market coffee from the corner coffee shop versus drinking

1703
01:32:26.950 --> 01:32:29.440
upgraded coffee,
just black coffee versus black coffee.

1704
01:32:29.740 --> 01:32:32.170
And they did a battery of cognitive tests,
um,

1705
01:32:32.171 --> 01:32:34.150
straight from like psychology research.

1706
01:32:34.450 --> 01:32:38.140
And they did the battery twice a day and they did this whole thing for six
weeks.

1707
01:32:38.980 --> 01:32:39.813
And on,

1708
01:32:40.780 --> 01:32:44.230
I want to make sure I have my data rights either seven or nine or five oh seven.

1709
01:32:44.260 --> 01:32:47.530
I don't have it memorized.
Um,
of,
uh,
of the things we measured,

1710
01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:53.040
there was a very substantial difference between the bulletproof coffee versus

1711
01:32:53.531 --> 01:32:57.850
non bulletproof and this wasn't testing it with the upgraded MCT or even better

1712
01:32:57.851 --> 01:33:01.660
yet the brain octane stuff.
But this was just black coffee versus black coffee,

1713
01:33:01.690 --> 01:33:04.810
then coffee with butter versus coffee with butter.
And it was interesting.

1714
01:33:04.811 --> 01:33:09.130
Butter actually had a negative response on one of the five um,
one of the seven,

1715
01:33:09.131 --> 01:33:12.940
I guess measures of cognitive function that we were looking at.
So this is uh,

1716
01:33:13.250 --> 01:33:16.000
it's pretty darn in legitimate for like a small company.

1717
01:33:16.030 --> 01:33:19.990
Like we funded this ourselves and it wasn't,
it's not a perfect study,

1718
01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:23.350
but it doesn't look like there's a placebo effect because butter was supposed to

1719
01:33:23.351 --> 01:33:25.630
be positive,
but it was pretty much neutral with one negative.

1720
01:33:25.990 --> 01:33:27.820
So we're going to be putting this stuff up,

1721
01:33:27.821 --> 01:33:30.940
but there's like more of the writeup that has to happen in order for it to be

1722
01:33:30.941 --> 01:33:33.610
like an accepted paper and all that.
Now

1723
01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:35.740
<v 0>as far as the negative impacts,</v>

1724
01:33:35.770 --> 01:33:39.430
you attribute the negative impacts of these other people drinking other coffee.

1725
01:33:39.431 --> 01:33:41.620
You attribute that to mycotoxins.

1726
01:33:42.070 --> 01:33:46.620
<v 1>It's not just mold toxins.
Toxins from old are are a major,</v>

1727
01:33:46.650 --> 01:33:47.790
major contributing factor.

1728
01:33:47.791 --> 01:33:52.740
And I demo know that and there's a reason that in this,
this little test we did,

1729
01:33:53.730 --> 01:33:57.600
we found people had a difference there.
I'm particularly sensitive,

1730
01:33:57.601 --> 01:33:59.940
I've got the lab tests that show it and so I,

1731
01:34:00.030 --> 01:34:02.100
I'm a canary for this and I know very,

1732
01:34:02.130 --> 01:34:06.180
very well when coffee has it cause I feel like a Zombie and 28% of the

1733
01:34:06.181 --> 01:34:09.720
population has the same genes I do that make them more susceptible to mold.

1734
01:34:09.920 --> 01:34:14.920
It's in the HLA part of your genetic code and it's how you respond to clotting

1735
01:34:15.271 --> 01:34:20.010
and how you respond to infection.
So I have like a hyperactive immune response,

1736
01:34:20.011 --> 01:34:23.430
which protects me if I was like a rogue invader in Europe,

1737
01:34:23.940 --> 01:34:27.360
I'm well designed to get cut by a sword shot by an Arrow and then go invade your

1738
01:34:27.361 --> 01:34:28.440
town and not get sick.

1739
01:34:28.710 --> 01:34:31.200
The problem is if I'm like breathing toxic mold all the time,

1740
01:34:31.201 --> 01:34:33.750
are drinking it in my coffee,
it's a chronic low level exposure,

1741
01:34:33.751 --> 01:34:37.050
but my body thinks I'm being attacked.
So I tend to clot too much.

1742
01:34:37.051 --> 01:34:40.800
I get sticky blood and I get a chronic inflammation that won't turn off.

1743
01:34:41.310 --> 01:34:45.030
And that's one of the reasons that I'm sensitive to these things and I can feel

1744
01:34:45.031 --> 01:34:47.340
them.
And then I went out and I did the work to quantify it.

1745
01:34:47.610 --> 01:34:50.550
So mold toxins or one of them,
but there's hundreds of mold toxins.

1746
01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:54.870
So I went through and identified which ones are causing this problem the most.

1747
01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:58.070
And I test for those and I talk Okra toxin and I talked

1748
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:59.660
<v 4>about aflatoxin,
like the main ones,</v>

1749
01:34:59.661 --> 01:35:02.510
but there's other ones that are in some strange of coffee that aren't in others.

1750
01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:04.850
And then there's other things called biogenic amines.

1751
01:35:05.090 --> 01:35:08.360
And I look at those as well.
So when you quantify all of that stuff,

1752
01:35:08.390 --> 01:35:11.420
when you get the numbers right and you get them far lower than even the European

1753
01:35:11.421 --> 01:35:13.950
standards,
you end up with some uh,

1754
01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.910
some interesting effects from the coffee that just don't come out because most

1755
01:35:16.911 --> 01:35:20.840
coffee has some good and some bad in it.
So like this is a,

1756
01:35:20.841 --> 01:35:22.130
I wanted to drink coffee,

1757
01:35:22.131 --> 01:35:24.530
I gave up coffee for five years because it was messing with my head.

1758
01:35:24.531 --> 01:35:25.790
So this was my own self interest.

1759
01:35:26.060 --> 01:35:29.930
It's a legitimate scientific exploration on my part,

1760
01:35:30.230 --> 01:35:31.940
partly because I wanted to drink good coffee,

1761
01:35:32.090 --> 01:35:34.000
but also because like this is what I do,
like,

1762
01:35:34.001 --> 01:35:35.750
like this fascinates me and interest me.

1763
01:35:35.751 --> 01:35:38.450
And I did not expect the effects to be this big,
especially on other people.

1764
01:35:38.451 --> 01:35:42.620
But they're real.
And that study and when people say I,
I'm very sure of it

1765
01:35:42.770 --> 01:35:43.710
<v 0>does make sense.</v>

1766
01:35:43.711 --> 01:35:48.210
If there are toxins on coffee and those toxins are bad for you,

1767
01:35:48.360 --> 01:35:51.270
that that would have a negative impact on cognitive function.

1768
01:35:51.300 --> 01:35:55.770
It totally makes sense.
But my question is what are you doing different?

1769
01:35:55.950 --> 01:35:58.440
Like what?
Like,
when you say the bulletproof method,

1770
01:35:58.441 --> 01:36:01.100
what the fuck does that mean man?
The problem,

1771
01:36:01.160 --> 01:36:03.750
like you gotta tell people what you do.

1772
01:36:03.900 --> 01:36:08.400
That makes sense so that they understand how you can actually remove toxins.

1773
01:36:08.520 --> 01:36:12.180
Cause the one piece of criticism that I hear all the time is like,

1774
01:36:12.420 --> 01:36:16.470
how do you know that your coffee doesn't have mycotoxins in it?

1775
01:36:16.471 --> 01:36:19.710
And what is the method for preventing it?
So

1776
01:36:19.850 --> 01:36:24.680
<v 4>how I know is I send it through a medical,
not medical,
uh,
what we'll call it,</v>

1777
01:36:24.681 --> 01:36:27.530
an analytical Abbott Laboratory.
You could do medical stuff with it,

1778
01:36:27.800 --> 01:36:32.120
but I have a set of internal standards that make it bulletproof or not.

1779
01:36:32.121 --> 01:36:34.130
If it doesn't meet the requirements,
it's not,

1780
01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:37.550
it's not coffee than I'm going to be putting in a bag and calling bulletproof.

1781
01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:40.850
But to get it to that point,
that's the proof point.

1782
01:36:41.180 --> 01:36:45.470
Then you go back and you look at every step of coffee production and I'm not

1783
01:36:45.471 --> 01:36:48.680
going to be telling the world how to make bulletproof coffee.
Um,

1784
01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:51.680
I spend a lot of time working on how to do this.

1785
01:36:51.890 --> 01:36:54.500
But what I do is I look at what are the sources for these toxins?

1786
01:36:54.501 --> 01:36:56.240
Why do they form,
how do they form?

1787
01:36:56.570 --> 01:37:01.370
And what's happening is there's old world like they call it second wave coffee

1788
01:37:01.371 --> 01:37:01.541
light,

1789
01:37:01.541 --> 01:37:06.050
like the original kind of Starbucks and Peet's coffee and these kind of even

1790
01:37:06.051 --> 01:37:07.630
before them,
the Folgers and,

1791
01:37:07.631 --> 01:37:10.160
and just the normal coffee companies that have been selling coffee for a long

1792
01:37:10.161 --> 01:37:10.910
time.

1793
01:37:10.910 --> 01:37:15.680
They typically look at economics and then we started looking at at flavor with

1794
01:37:15.681 --> 01:37:18.770
the Starbucks and you have third wave coffee guys who I greatly respect as

1795
01:37:18.771 --> 01:37:19.850
coffee artisans.

1796
01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:23.810
And these are like the modern cool coffee shops where they roast their own beans

1797
01:37:23.811 --> 01:37:25.790
and you know,
it was carefully selected by this.

1798
01:37:26.270 --> 01:37:28.940
And what the first round of people did is they said,

1799
01:37:28.941 --> 01:37:33.560
how do I make coffee cheap and widely available and good enough to make a
profit?

1800
01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:36.230
So that's an economic thing.
The second guy said,

1801
01:37:36.231 --> 01:37:39.140
how do we make really flavorful coffee?
It was a taste thing.

1802
01:37:39.470 --> 01:37:41.300
And I came along and I said,

1803
01:37:41.301 --> 01:37:44.060
how do I make coffee that makes me feel good all the time and I'm willing to

1804
01:37:44.061 --> 01:37:46.100
sacrifice taste.
I'm willing to sacrifice economics.

1805
01:37:46.190 --> 01:37:50.120
So I just had a different lens when I was looking at coffee because of my own

1806
01:37:50.570 --> 01:37:53.930
personal wiring.
And in order to do that,

1807
01:37:53.931 --> 01:37:57.660
I dug in on the side is what happens there on the transport side.

1808
01:37:57.870 --> 01:38:01.230
And there's a whole decision tree about what you can do in order to get coffee

1809
01:38:01.350 --> 01:38:02.101
to be bulletproof.

1810
01:38:02.101 --> 01:38:05.940
And it also depends on what part of the world you're you're dealing with,
right?

1811
01:38:07.140 --> 01:38:09.510
So I've oftentimes recommended Central American coffee.

1812
01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:11.130
There's a little problem though.

1813
01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:15.660
70% of next year's coffee crop in Central America will probably be lost to

1814
01:38:15.661 --> 01:38:19.770
coffee rust,
which is a type of fungus and this fungus 70 versa,

1815
01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:21.870
it's going to completely decimate this.

1816
01:38:21.871 --> 01:38:26.340
And this kind of fungus called rust actually killed some South American things

1817
01:38:26.341 --> 01:38:29.040
and Indonesian coffee for many years historically.

1818
01:38:29.370 --> 01:38:32.220
So it basically kills the plants,
it,

1819
01:38:32.250 --> 01:38:34.830
it eats the leaves so they can't produce any coffee.

1820
01:38:35.130 --> 01:38:38.910
And some of the coffee analysts I've talked to her calling it like,
you know,

1821
01:38:38.970 --> 01:38:41.670
a bloodbath in Central America in terms of coffee.

1822
01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:43.140
You do a search for coffee rust,

1823
01:38:43.170 --> 01:38:45.900
you'll see it and no one's sure how it got there.

1824
01:38:46.230 --> 01:38:49.920
But the Arabica plants that we rely on to make good coffee are particularly

1825
01:38:49.921 --> 01:38:54.180
susceptible and shade grown coffee doesn't get it cause it has a protective

1826
01:38:54.181 --> 01:38:58.230
fungal biome in the soil,
which is something I look for by the way.
Um,

1827
01:38:58.410 --> 01:39:02.250
so when you have a fungus that protects coffee from rust,
it's likely to survive.

1828
01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:07.560
But when you go out to sea sun grown coffee,

1829
01:39:07.561 --> 01:39:11.280
which we do to increase production,
there isn't this other fungus in the soil.

1830
01:39:11.281 --> 01:39:14.310
So then the Russ can just run rampant.
So many clear the forest.

1831
01:39:14.311 --> 01:39:16.170
When we plant coffee in an industrial way,

1832
01:39:16.380 --> 01:39:19.050
it increases the odds of bad fungus moving in.

1833
01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:22.800
And then there's a whole part of processing the coffee where there's different

1834
01:39:22.801 --> 01:39:25.950
techniques and different tweaks you can make in the coffee processing in order

1835
01:39:25.951 --> 01:39:28.470
to influence the cost of the amount of time,

1836
01:39:28.471 --> 01:39:31.350
the amount of materials required to process the coffee.

1837
01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:32.910
And I looked at that and said,

1838
01:39:32.911 --> 01:39:35.580
I'm not trying to save money and I'm not trying to create the world's most

1839
01:39:35.581 --> 01:39:37.080
flavorful coffee possible.

1840
01:39:37.081 --> 01:39:40.170
I'm trying to create high performance coffee and it turns out it tastes pretty

1841
01:39:40.171 --> 01:39:43.080
darn good.
I've had cup of excellence winning coffee,

1842
01:39:43.380 --> 01:39:46.770
which is so phenomenally delicious.
It has mold toxins in it.

1843
01:39:46.771 --> 01:39:49.890
I know very well cause I'm a mold detector for it and I get all the symptoms I

1844
01:39:49.891 --> 01:39:53.100
get when I want to have mold when I drink that and I'm like,
wow,

1845
01:39:53.101 --> 01:39:55.560
it was still worth it because it was such good coffee,

1846
01:39:55.710 --> 01:39:58.140
but I don't want to drink that for breakfast every morning because it,

1847
01:39:58.290 --> 01:39:59.160
it slows me down,

1848
01:39:59.161 --> 01:40:03.060
it messes me up and there's enough people who are very sensitive to it that it's

1849
01:40:03.061 --> 01:40:06.030
transformative and there's a bunch of other people who don't really feel a giant

1850
01:40:06.031 --> 01:40:09.570
difference,
but you can measure it on a cognitive function tests.

1851
01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:12.510
Are you going to release any studies on other people's coughing?

1852
01:40:12.550 --> 01:40:16.170
Are you going to release any expensive to test for it?

1853
01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:21.540
For original question,
please.
Yeah,
I mean,
I keep talking about these,

1854
01:40:21.541 --> 01:40:26.541
these coffees like this has mycotoxins and as 25% of this w w so,

1855
01:40:27.691 --> 01:40:29.880
so right now let,
let's take Starbucks and not to pick on Starbucks,

1856
01:40:29.881 --> 01:40:31.470
they're just a big coffee company.
Whose number is,

1857
01:40:31.471 --> 01:40:36.180
I know they have $816 million worth of coffee in inventory right now.

1858
01:40:36.420 --> 01:40:36.900
Right?

1859
01:40:36.900 --> 01:40:41.700
So in order to get an adequate sample size for $816 million worth of coffee,
um,

1860
01:40:42.050 --> 01:40:46.800
I am a very small company and I spent tens of thousands of dollars on

1861
01:40:46.801 --> 01:40:50.430
quantifying the coffee in order to get the bulletproof process where,

1862
01:40:50.460 --> 01:40:53.860
where it is.
And I regularly test my own coffee,
right?

1863
01:40:53.890 --> 01:40:58.240
So I don't know how I could possibly get a reliable sample,

1864
01:40:58.420 --> 01:41:00.430
especially not knowing the backend processing.

1865
01:41:00.431 --> 01:41:03.760
What I'd like to see is I'd like to see us regulatory authorities adopt European

1866
01:41:03.761 --> 01:41:06.640
standards for coffee.
That'd be a great first step,
right?
Right.

1867
01:41:06.641 --> 01:41:11.200
But bulletproof coffee is popular in Europe as well because those aren't the

1868
01:41:11.201 --> 01:41:12.940
only standards we follow up.
If that's the case,

1869
01:41:12.941 --> 01:41:16.660
where are you getting your numbers from?
As far as like other people's coffees.

1870
01:41:16.661 --> 01:41:20.860
There's about six different studies I referenced at different times and I don't

1871
01:41:20.861 --> 01:41:23.570
have references in front of me on those things.
Um,

1872
01:41:24.130 --> 01:41:29.130
but one of the studies says around 92.3% of South American coffee had mold toxic

1873
01:41:30.371 --> 01:41:33.490
mold spores in it.
And when you look at another one,

1874
01:41:33.491 --> 01:41:35.980
it says 60% there's different studies.

1875
01:41:36.430 --> 01:41:40.330
Most of them say at least 50% of Okra toxin makes it through the brew.

1876
01:41:40.510 --> 01:41:43.860
And I've also talked with someone like the top backend coffee procreating

1877
01:41:43.870 --> 01:41:44.320
experts,

1878
01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:48.910
they know about mold toxins in coffee and the coffee artisanal companies will

1879
01:41:48.911 --> 01:41:51.490
stand up and say,
this can be our coffees mold free,
but they don't measure it.

1880
01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.340
They don't even know which ones to measure or where to measure them.

1881
01:41:54.670 --> 01:41:59.410
That's insane.
Yeah.
So it was a lot of work.
It took a long time to do it.

1882
01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:00.880
And how'd you get on this track?

1883
01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:06.460
My first thing I ever sold as an entrepreneur was I worked at Baskin Robbins.

1884
01:42:06.461 --> 01:42:09.880
I was scooping ice cream to pay for my studies at University of California.

1885
01:42:10.180 --> 01:42:14.230
The reason my tuition 1500% and what?
Oh yeah.

1886
01:42:14.231 --> 01:42:15.520
And while I was at school there,

1887
01:42:15.521 --> 01:42:19.740
this was like back in 1990 I couldn't afford to go to school.
100% yeah,
no,

1888
01:42:19.810 --> 01:42:22.540
no joke.
They were building a new university center.
So they just love you.

1889
01:42:22.541 --> 01:42:25.780
The crap out of students.
I didn't have enough money.
So I started a company,

1890
01:42:25.781 --> 01:42:28.210
I sold caffeine tee-shirts,
said caffeine,
my drug of choice.

1891
01:42:28.420 --> 01:42:31.990
I was like 19 years old and I sold them to 12 countries over the internet and

1892
01:42:31.991 --> 01:42:34.990
that was like,
you know,
ended up getting you an entrepreneur magazine.

1893
01:42:35.080 --> 01:42:36.820
So I've been a coffee guy since I was a kid.

1894
01:42:37.090 --> 01:42:39.730
I had to give up coffee for five years because I would drink it and I would get

1895
01:42:39.731 --> 01:42:43.210
like a headache and I would get sore joints and I would just feel like I drink

1896
01:42:43.211 --> 01:42:45.490
it and I feel great and I crashed and I feel like crap.

1897
01:42:45.970 --> 01:42:49.120
And what happened is I was getting autoimmune things because the toxic molds

1898
01:42:49.121 --> 01:42:53.620
that growing coffee cross react with gluten.
That's a big problems.

1899
01:42:53.621 --> 01:42:54.460
I'm gluten sensitive.

1900
01:42:54.580 --> 01:42:57.700
So what happened is I just gave up coffee and it made me sad and then I would

1901
01:42:57.701 --> 01:43:00.880
drink a cup of coffee and I'd feel great and the next day I drink another cup of

1902
01:43:00.881 --> 01:43:03.640
coffee and I'd feel like a Zombie and like what changed?

1903
01:43:03.670 --> 01:43:05.080
And finally I realized it wasn't me,

1904
01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:08.500
it was the coffee and I started doing my research and I started digging in.

1905
01:43:08.710 --> 01:43:11.390
So call it enlightened self interest,
but like there,

1906
01:43:11.420 --> 01:43:12.910
there's no bs marketing here.

1907
01:43:12.911 --> 01:43:16.870
Like this is me intentionally creating coffee that I could drink every morning

1908
01:43:17.020 --> 01:43:19.300
and putting it out there saying do other people have this?

1909
01:43:19.301 --> 01:43:21.580
And the results were bigger than I thought they'd be.

1910
01:43:21.610 --> 01:43:25.390
I definitely notice a difference when I have your stuff or whether if I go to

1911
01:43:25.391 --> 01:43:30.250
Starbucks,
like sometimes Starbucks is fun.
It's true.
It's very hidden ass.

1912
01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:32.740
I,
and I'm not ultra sensitive to it,

1913
01:43:32.741 --> 01:43:36.520
but there's a difference between the way I feel when I drink bulletproof coffee

1914
01:43:36.521 --> 01:43:38.290
and the way I feel when I drink regular coffee.

1915
01:43:38.470 --> 01:43:41.140
But what other coffees are okay to drink?

1916
01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:43.710
Like how do you know what's okay to drink and what not.
Okay.

1917
01:43:43.770 --> 01:43:48.770
If you can get better odds by going to any coffee shop where there's lots of

1918
01:43:49.511 --> 01:43:54.440
guys or girls with tattoos,
piercings and Mohawks.
Right.

1919
01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:55.730
Why is that?
Well,

1920
01:43:55.731 --> 01:44:00.170
because people who are coffee people and I count myself very enthusiastically

1921
01:44:00.171 --> 01:44:00.531
amongst them,

1922
01:44:00.531 --> 01:44:04.910
like they're people who are obsessive about it and if you go to a coffee shop

1923
01:44:04.911 --> 01:44:08.660
like that,
they're paying more attention to sourcing so you reduce the odds.

1924
01:44:08.930 --> 01:44:13.930
Now I would very happily have just gone to the local and you know in the bay

1925
01:44:14.331 --> 01:44:18.220
area you can get lots,
lots of artisanal coffee shops.
Got to New York,
you,

1926
01:44:18.221 --> 01:44:20.570
you know you got to any big city,
there's you know,

1927
01:44:20.571 --> 01:44:24.320
a hundred guys competing to say am I roasters the shiniest and you know my beans

1928
01:44:24.321 --> 01:44:27.230
come from one but Valdez,
great grandson and all this stuff,
right.

1929
01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:30.770
The problem is that the reliability isn't there and like,

1930
01:44:30.771 --> 01:44:34.160
I'm not going to name names because it's a community.

1931
01:44:34.550 --> 01:44:36.020
I've been to some of the coolest,

1932
01:44:36.140 --> 01:44:40.340
most amazing coffee shops in big cities and I've come out of their drinking

1933
01:44:40.341 --> 01:44:44.360
single estate,
Central American and it is not clean coffee.

1934
01:44:44.420 --> 01:44:46.850
It is wonderful tasting.
It is a work of art,

1935
01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:50.150
but it doesn't cause the human performance I'm looking for and I know very well

1936
01:44:50.151 --> 01:44:51.260
that it has mold toxins in it.

1937
01:44:51.261 --> 01:44:53.030
And I know that if I took it out and I quantified it,

1938
01:44:53.031 --> 01:44:54.020
that I could show the difference.

1939
01:44:54.690 --> 01:44:57.000
<v 0>You should do that.
You should go to places and just,</v>

1940
01:44:57.060 --> 01:44:58.920
it was buy a cup of coffee at Pete's,

1941
01:44:58.921 --> 01:45:03.870
buy a cup of coffee at whatever and just test them just for bucks in every
state.

1942
01:45:03.930 --> 01:45:07.050
How much would it cost to do each day in order to guest

1943
01:45:07.470 --> 01:45:08.760
<v 4>even like,
uh,
uh,</v>

1944
01:45:09.090 --> 01:45:12.960
I looked at like doing a sample size that would be useful for,

1945
01:45:13.080 --> 01:45:15.690
for that we're talking like a quarter million.

1946
01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:16.220
<v 0>No,
no,
no,</v>

1947
01:45:16.220 --> 01:45:20.970
but I'm saying how much would it cost to taste test in an individual cup of

1948
01:45:20.971 --> 01:45:21.804
coffee?

1949
01:45:21.870 --> 01:45:26.490
<v 4>Um,
it depends on which there's different bulletproof panels I run,</v>

1950
01:45:26.610 --> 01:45:28.920
but it could cost in the neighborhood.

1951
01:45:28.950 --> 01:45:31.890
If I was to do like a full intensive analysis could cast around $5,000

1952
01:45:31.970 --> 01:45:35.100
<v 0>$5,000 for a cup of coffee.
Wow.
Only for one.
Yeah.</v>

1953
01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:38.540
So if you wanted to test for different companies will cost you 20 grand and

1954
01:45:38.541 --> 01:45:39.351
that's not four different counties.

1955
01:45:39.351 --> 01:45:41.990
That's four different samples for different crops.
Right.

1956
01:45:41.991 --> 01:45:45.380
So let's say you have a bag,
a hundred pound bag of coffee,
right?

1957
01:45:45.450 --> 01:45:50.060
There wasn't wrapped properly like most of the test as a coffee or just the

1958
01:45:50.090 --> 01:45:54.140
beans.
What?
What about the coffee itself?
Can you,
can you get a result from that?

1959
01:45:54.230 --> 01:45:55.063
<v 4>It would be,</v>

1960
01:45:56.030 --> 01:46:00.060
I'd have to do some work on understanding how you preserve a coffee sample to

1961
01:46:00.061 --> 01:46:01.670
send it into an analytical lab.

1962
01:46:01.790 --> 01:46:05.540
It was say you don't get like a breakdown over time,
even one hour after you,

1963
01:46:05.630 --> 01:46:08.240
you brew coffee.
It changes chemically quite a lot.

1964
01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:13.340
So I have no idea what the breakdown of mold toxins is over time.

1965
01:46:13.341 --> 01:46:14.450
In post brewed coffee,

1966
01:46:14.570 --> 01:46:19.130
we have good data about whether brewing takes out the toxins and there's one

1967
01:46:19.131 --> 01:46:20.690
study that says it takes out most of it,

1968
01:46:20.691 --> 01:46:25.310
but all of the other studies say at least half and some say upwards of about 80%

1969
01:46:25.311 --> 01:46:29.360
remain and it's pretty well known that Okra toxin is a heat stable toxin.

1970
01:46:29.690 --> 01:46:30.820
And that's just one of the ones

1971
01:46:30.950 --> 01:46:33.910
<v 0>testing.
No.
Has Anybody at any of these large chains,</v>

1972
01:46:33.930 --> 01:46:37.060
we don't want to mention any names.
Has Anybody contacted you?

1973
01:46:37.420 --> 01:46:39.570
Has Anybody said hey,
um,

1974
01:46:39.970 --> 01:46:44.290
we're interested in what you figured out and we would like to apply that method

1975
01:46:44.291 --> 01:46:47.560
to our beans or whatever.
Has Anybody done that?

1976
01:46:48.030 --> 01:46:52.770
<v 4>Um,
I haven't had a formal inquiry but there are spies amongst us.</v>

1977
01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:56.220
They're the gods of coffee.
Like,
like people who are,
you know,

1978
01:46:56.270 --> 01:46:58.980
the power brokers behind the whole coffee industry.

1979
01:46:58.981 --> 01:47:02.360
And keep in mind it's like the fourth largest commodity industry on Earth.
Right?

1980
01:47:02.490 --> 01:47:06.240
So what I'm doing is kind of disruptive cause I'm sort of like saying guys,
we,

1981
01:47:06.580 --> 01:47:08.180
we can do better,
right?

1982
01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:12.330
Because you've been doing mostly economics with a tiny bit of people who care a

1983
01:47:12.331 --> 01:47:14.130
lot about flavor and all that.

1984
01:47:14.131 --> 01:47:18.540
But that's actually what about human health and human performance?
So,

1985
01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:22.590
well I'm having some very interesting conversations along that front and I would

1986
01:47:22.591 --> 01:47:25.650
love to see a way to get plantations bulletproof.

1987
01:47:25.700 --> 01:47:28.050
So you're going to wind up like that dude who made the water car.

1988
01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:33.750
I hope car that runs on water.
They're going to ICU.
The ICU.

1989
01:47:34.200 --> 01:47:35.970
If they do it,
I hope it's like iced espresso.

1990
01:47:35.971 --> 01:47:39.450
They drown me in us sweep that shit under the rug so quickly.

1991
01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:40.790
Now it's one of the things I,

1992
01:47:40.910 --> 01:47:45.630
I am a a s I still respect the guys who have done innovative brewing techniques.

1993
01:47:47.750 --> 01:47:51.200
I see what you're doing.
Good move.
I'm all over the time.
You should do,

1994
01:47:51.201 --> 01:47:54.870
you should really start kissing a little coffee.
I'm all over the coffee culture.

1995
01:47:54.930 --> 01:47:57.810
You know,
I thought about piercing myself just so I could fit in better,

1996
01:47:58.260 --> 01:48:02.080
but I mean seriously Joe,
I,
I go to high end coffee shops and I,

1997
01:48:02.081 --> 01:48:05.400
I marvel at the cool stuff they're creating and the cool vibe in the community

1998
01:48:05.401 --> 01:48:07.680
and the culture and I'm not trying to dump on that stuff.

1999
01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:12.090
I'm just saying that if I want to feel at my very best,

2000
01:48:12.660 --> 01:48:16.590
I literally don't drink the coffee,
the fucking horse to death.
I understand that.

2001
01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:21.660
What I'm,
what I was asking though is that if I was a guy who ran,
you know,

2002
01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:25.830
x company,
some gigantic coffee thing,
I must know about you.

2003
01:48:26.310 --> 01:48:29.280
Why now there is no way they could not.
Um,

2004
01:48:29.670 --> 01:48:34.350
there's a denial there,
uh,
where they say,
yeah,
that's all bs.

2005
01:48:34.620 --> 01:48:39.180
But when I talked to some of the guys who have been working with coffee for 25

2006
01:48:39.181 --> 01:48:42.800
and 30 years,
they will tell me flat out,
yeah,

2007
01:48:43.020 --> 01:48:46.830
we know about this problem.
Wasn't that on that show dangerous grounds?

2008
01:48:46.831 --> 01:48:48.210
Wasn't that something that they've covered?

2009
01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:51.380
Was there a show at the book or I guess it wasn't Sean,

2010
01:48:51.590 --> 01:48:54.030
the travel channel by the coffee.
I haven't seen that one.
I've seen,

2011
01:48:54.090 --> 01:48:57.090
I was thinking uncommon grounds,
which is the most phenomenal coffee book ever.

2012
01:48:57.091 --> 01:49:00.300
That book is worth reading.
Oh yeah,
yeah.
It's coffee book.
Yeah.

2013
01:49:00.301 --> 01:49:05.200
It's about the history of coffee.
Yes.
Coffee Table Book.
It's,
uh,

2014
01:49:05.450 --> 01:49:06.061
it's not,

2015
01:49:06.061 --> 01:49:08.500
at least I have it on my kindle so I can't tell you if it's going to have his

2016
01:49:08.501 --> 01:49:09.334
picture rescue or not.

2017
01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:13.170
But it's the whole history of the coffee business going all the way back and

2018
01:49:13.171 --> 01:49:17.880
like coffee's fueled like South American dictators and Central American like

2019
01:49:17.910 --> 01:49:22.140
genocide that like it,
it has changed the shape of economics and food marketing.

2020
01:49:22.340 --> 01:49:27.180
It,
it's an amazing thing to read and understand and um,
you can,

2021
01:49:27.210 --> 01:49:30.690
you can sort of see how,
how the use of coffee has changed,
but people don't know,

2022
01:49:30.691 --> 01:49:33.960
like the revolutionary war and the civil war were totally coffee powered and

2023
01:49:33.961 --> 01:49:35.280
they were a strategic asset.

2024
01:49:35.580 --> 01:49:39.030
And the reason that your parents drink watery coffee is because there was a

2025
01:49:39.540 --> 01:49:42.510
spike in coffee pricing.
So the coffee marketing companies,

2026
01:49:42.511 --> 01:49:45.420
the really big ones like chasing Sandborne,
they got together and they're like,

2027
01:49:45.421 --> 01:49:48.010
let's convince people to use less coffee cup and tell them it's the

2028
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:51.150
<v 1>same so we can still charge more for less coffee.
Huh?</v>

2029
01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:53.650
That's why you have three quarters of a pound of beans in a bag.

2030
01:49:53.651 --> 01:49:54.880
That's the standard size.

2031
01:49:55.180 --> 01:49:58.870
The big mass marketing companies did this 30 years ago and that's why it's three

2032
01:49:58.871 --> 01:50:03.180
quarters of a pound.
That's fascinating.
Now do you think that the,

2033
01:50:03.181 --> 01:50:06.160
the transition there during the Boston tea party thing,

2034
01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:08.140
transition from tea to coffee,

2035
01:50:08.290 --> 01:50:11.980
had anything to do with the way the direction of this country went?

2036
01:50:12.130 --> 01:50:17.080
Why are there so many fucking psychos here?
I think so.
Totally makes sense.

2037
01:50:17.260 --> 01:50:19.750
They get hooked up on this fucking wild jet fuel.

2038
01:50:19.870 --> 01:50:24.850
They've been sipping tea with pinkies up their entire lives over in England and

2039
01:50:24.851 --> 01:50:27.730
then they come over here and they're,
they're gangster anyway,

2040
01:50:27.731 --> 01:50:32.140
just for even making the journey.
It's a crazy move.
You could argue that.

2041
01:50:32.141 --> 01:50:35.140
But the enlightenment in Europe was all about coffee.

2042
01:50:35.350 --> 01:50:36.880
These people met and did all this,

2043
01:50:36.881 --> 01:50:40.780
like the creation of science they were doing at coffee houses,
drinking coffee,

2044
01:50:40.781 --> 01:50:43.450
and the government was trying to shut down coffee houses and they did it a few

2045
01:50:43.451 --> 01:50:47.140
times because all the,
basically revolutionaries,
we're gathering coffee houses.

2046
01:50:47.260 --> 01:50:49.750
So then they come over here,
they start drinking even more coffee,

2047
01:50:49.751 --> 01:50:53.680
which they did in early America.
Quite a lot of coffee.
And then what do you know?

2048
01:50:53.681 --> 01:50:55.780
They throw a revolution.
Totally makes sense.

2049
01:50:55.781 --> 01:50:58.660
Everybody gets all excited when they drink coffee at it makes me feel like a

2050
01:50:58.661 --> 01:51:01.750
revolutionary.
I remember working like doing construction.

2051
01:51:01.751 --> 01:51:03.160
I'd fucking hated my job,

2052
01:51:03.430 --> 01:51:06.100
but I would drink coffee and I actually start enjoying it a little bit.

2053
01:51:06.730 --> 01:51:10.150
I want to knock some nails in.
Just gives you a little endorphin rush.

2054
01:51:10.151 --> 01:51:14.620
It feels that was Dunkin donuts coffee.
That's probably all mycotoxins.

2055
01:51:15.250 --> 01:51:16.840
Probably not all.
To be perfectly honest.

2056
01:51:16.841 --> 01:51:19.330
You may go there and you may get a cop that's perfectly clean.

2057
01:51:19.480 --> 01:51:22.880
Just the odds are really low.
And what are the odds?
If you had to guess,
honestly,

2058
01:51:22.881 --> 01:51:26.030
you're probably just guessing,
right?
I am very much guessing here.
Um,
if,

2059
01:51:26.090 --> 01:51:30.340
if you were to go to any of the mass market coffee companies,
I mean,

2060
01:51:30.341 --> 01:51:33.880
they're blending coffee from all over the place in each ginormous amounts of it.

2061
01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:39.070
Uh,
your odds of getting something that's super clean are,
are like five or 10%,

2062
01:51:39.071 --> 01:51:41.740
if even that,
because wow,
we think about it.

2063
01:51:41.780 --> 01:51:44.370
You get coffee from all these different places.
It's all mixed in a,
you know,

2064
01:51:44.520 --> 01:51:49.270
giant runs and all and then they measure like whatever the legal requirements

2065
01:51:49.271 --> 01:51:51.010
are here and then their own internal things.

2066
01:51:51.190 --> 01:51:55.240
But it's going to be like how do you get it to the highest acceptable level

2067
01:51:55.270 --> 01:51:58.060
versus the cleanest possible level.
It's a different perspective.

2068
01:51:58.061 --> 01:52:01.460
What are the studies that have been done on this shit on mold toxin?

2069
01:52:01.461 --> 01:52:04.090
It was someone can find mold toxins in coffee.

2070
01:52:04.120 --> 01:52:08.410
What does Google a mycotoxin coffee and you'll see like,

2071
01:52:08.650 --> 01:52:12.100
I mean there's a lot of them out there who's done them.
Uh,

2072
01:52:12.370 --> 01:52:16.390
agricultural commodities,
people,
agricultural universities around the world.

2073
01:52:16.420 --> 01:52:19.440
There's some in Italy,
there's some in Argentina,
Brazil,
Portugal,

2074
01:52:19.450 --> 01:52:23.920
exec.com first article.
I do link to a few of that stuff.
He makes you weak.

2075
01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:28.610
How did choose mycotoxin free coffee on natural news?
Yeah.
That,

2076
01:52:28.611 --> 01:52:32.770
that one looks exactly like my article almost.
Exactly.
Oh they fuck you.

2077
01:52:32.940 --> 01:52:33.650
No didn't fuck me.

2078
01:52:33.650 --> 01:52:36.790
They just got their name cause they really of course drink coffee that has been

2079
01:52:36.791 --> 01:52:40.870
made via wet processing because mycotoxins often formed during the drying

2080
01:52:40.871 --> 01:52:45.130
process.
Wet beans are much less likely to contain.
And then driving.
So true.

2081
01:52:45.290 --> 01:52:46.123
That is very true.

2082
01:52:46.220 --> 01:52:48.380
<v 4>Do not drink decaffeinated coffee.</v>

2083
01:52:48.500 --> 01:52:51.590
Caffeine actually protects coffee beans from the growth of mold.

2084
01:52:51.620 --> 01:52:55.220
Caffeine is a protective agent and this is really cool because the whole,

2085
01:52:55.730 --> 01:52:58.610
the whole focus on avoiding anti-nutrients.

2086
01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:02.360
All plants don't want to get eaten by by animals.

2087
01:53:02.361 --> 01:53:04.460
The only plants want to get it and are the ones where you're supposed to poop

2088
01:53:04.461 --> 01:53:08.150
the seeds out to fertilize them.
The rest of plants protect themselves.

2089
01:53:08.480 --> 01:53:11.450
So coffee,
it doesn't want to get mold growing on it.

2090
01:53:11.451 --> 01:53:16.130
So caffeine is an Antifungal agent that the coffee bean itself uses to keep

2091
01:53:16.131 --> 01:53:18.530
molds from eating it because there's so much pressure to eat it.

2092
01:53:19.250 --> 01:53:22.040
There's also these other things called Di terpenes that are in coffee,

2093
01:53:22.041 --> 01:53:25.160
like caffeine Straw on cow hall,
and those are there for the same thing.

2094
01:53:25.190 --> 01:53:28.700
And those different things have other effects on the human body.

2095
01:53:29.150 --> 01:53:32.250
So positive effects.
In fact,
if you look at the,

2096
01:53:32.420 --> 01:53:36.560
the effects of phenol on health,
well these died terpenes are females.
There's,

2097
01:53:36.620 --> 01:53:40.250
there's a lot of polyphenols and coffee more so than in chocolate more than in

2098
01:53:40.251 --> 01:53:43.040
red wine.
So when you look at all these,

2099
01:53:43.041 --> 01:53:46.070
those are there to protect the plant from fungal,

2100
01:53:46.190 --> 01:53:48.740
biological insect and animal predators.

2101
01:53:48.860 --> 01:53:53.000
It just so happens that that one toxin that's made that protects the bean from

2102
01:53:53.001 --> 01:53:56.630
molds,
caffeine,
it has a positive effect on us.

2103
01:53:56.631 --> 01:54:00.110
So we really seek it out.
But if you take it out of the coffee,

2104
01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:02.660
then the coffee has less protection than it should.

2105
01:54:02.930 --> 01:54:04.430
And here's the problem with DECAF.

2106
01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:08.150
DECAF coffee doesn't taste very good.

2107
01:54:08.240 --> 01:54:12.980
So would you take the world's best most like prize winning beans and send them

2108
01:54:12.981 --> 01:54:16.300
through a process that removes their flavor?
No.
You take the moldy as crappiest,

2109
01:54:16.310 --> 01:54:18.200
lowest quality,
lowest grade beans,

2110
01:54:18.201 --> 01:54:21.590
and you decaf those because people who drink decaf don't drink it for flavor.

2111
01:54:22.220 --> 01:54:24.730
If they did,
they wouldn't drink decaf.
Yeah.
Why?
They drink in it?

2112
01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:27.260
My mom asked to drink decaf coffee.
You can't drink.
I be,

2113
01:54:27.530 --> 01:54:32.270
she doesn't have to drink coffee periods.
She loves coffee.
So I made it,

2114
01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:37.070
does it for that day.
I made my decaf beans because of people like that.

2115
01:54:37.100 --> 01:54:40.490
There's good studies that show decaf does good things for you.

2116
01:54:40.940 --> 01:54:45.470
And so I,
it's a very small percentage of people,

2117
01:54:45.471 --> 01:54:50.060
but the way I did is I took bulletproof beans and I send them right over the

2118
01:54:50.061 --> 01:54:52.910
border to the one place on earth where you can just Swiss water process,

2119
01:54:52.911 --> 01:54:57.050
which is in Vancouver and send them back over the border to Portland where my

2120
01:54:57.051 --> 01:55:00.980
roaster is and there that's the best you can if I can make,
and it's clean,

2121
01:55:00.981 --> 01:55:03.800
but it still doesn't taste good,
like it's decaf for God's sake.

2122
01:55:03.801 --> 01:55:05.300
So that's why decab is bad.

2123
01:55:05.330 --> 01:55:07.700
You get bad beans and it removes a protective element.

2124
01:55:07.910 --> 01:55:11.660
So it has to be super fresh DECAF and it has to be made from proper beans.

2125
01:55:11.661 --> 01:55:12.870
And most companies,
in fact,

2126
01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:16.730
no company I know of and it seemed like Starbucks decaf actually have caffeine

2127
01:55:16.731 --> 01:55:19.970
in it.
All DECAF has some caffeine in it.
Yeah.

2128
01:55:20.180 --> 01:55:24.890
But most of the decaf out there is done using volatile organic chemicals like

2129
01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:29.720
hexane and things like that.
And that was good for you.
Totally.
Just same time,

2130
01:55:30.140 --> 01:55:33.380
it's a thing that you can use to dissolve the caffeine out of the coffee.

2131
01:55:33.710 --> 01:55:35.720
So it turns out chemical process.

2132
01:55:35.721 --> 01:55:38.690
DECAF tastes a little better than Swiss water process,

2133
01:55:38.720 --> 01:55:42.530
but it has residues from the solvents that they use.

2134
01:55:43.440 --> 01:55:44.273
So it's a toss up.

2135
01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:48.180
Do you want more flavor and more residues or do you want like cleaner decaf

2136
01:55:48.181 --> 01:55:52.020
coffee?
Now what other foods contain mycotoxins that people should be like?

2137
01:55:52.021 --> 01:55:56.550
Avoid grains are terrible,
terrible problem.
Corn is right.

2138
01:55:56.620 --> 01:56:01.620
A corn like 90 to 98% of corn is infected with fusarium fungus on the stock.

2139
01:56:02.550 --> 01:56:04.890
It actually comes in through those little tassels on the end of it.

2140
01:56:05.100 --> 01:56:07.470
So by the time you get it,
there's already some in there.

2141
01:56:07.500 --> 01:56:11.040
It'll grow in fresh corn on the cob if it's not iced right after you pick it.

2142
01:56:11.370 --> 01:56:14.640
But if you dry the corn,
I mean there's humidity levels,

2143
01:56:14.641 --> 01:56:17.070
there's different amounts of things like that that influenced this.

2144
01:56:17.310 --> 01:56:21.630
But dried corn is universally something that's going to have levels of fusarium

2145
01:56:21.631 --> 01:56:25.050
and the associated toxins that makes,
and depending on the strain of Fusarium,

2146
01:56:25.051 --> 01:56:29.450
you can get try Casa thing.
You can get Okra toxin or you get food Cyrusone,

2147
01:56:29.460 --> 01:56:31.680
which is another toxin.
You don't need to memorize all these names,

2148
01:56:31.681 --> 01:56:35.870
but you should know that dried corn,
even like the vegan dried corn,
you know,

2149
01:56:36.390 --> 01:56:40.230
tortilla chips or whatever,
um,
are a potential risk.
And again,

2150
01:56:40.260 --> 01:56:44.010
it varies by season.
It varies by part of the world.
It varies by how dry it was.

2151
01:56:44.011 --> 01:56:47.370
If it's too dry,
you get mold because the plants are stressed.
If it's too wet,

2152
01:56:47.371 --> 01:56:50.940
you get mold because the plants were too wet.
So it's an agricultural commodity.

2153
01:56:50.941 --> 01:56:52.080
It's not a constant level.

2154
01:56:52.500 --> 01:56:57.500
And the main argument for avoiding these things is that we evolved to handle

2155
01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:01.470
eating something bad,
right?
You throw up,
you feel crappy,
you might,

2156
01:57:01.610 --> 01:57:04.200
you it get a headache,
you might get sick and then you recover.

2157
01:57:04.201 --> 01:57:07.080
You excrete the toxins and you'd go on and you kill the next will you pick the

2158
01:57:07.081 --> 01:57:08.880
next tuber.
And that's how it works.

2159
01:57:09.540 --> 01:57:14.540
But we never were meant to eat a low level of these toxins every single day in

2160
01:57:15.151 --> 01:57:17.970
every single meal.
It creates low grade chronic stress,

2161
01:57:17.971 --> 01:57:20.100
which leads to low grade chronic inflammation.

2162
01:57:20.670 --> 01:57:24.060
And the level of safety for Okra toxin.

2163
01:57:24.060 --> 01:57:29.060
Just one of these toxins that the European Union has for their citizens is five

2164
01:57:29.791 --> 01:57:32.880
parts per billion.
You're not going to see mold on your coffee.

2165
01:57:32.881 --> 01:57:36.930
You're not going to taste it is parts per billion.
Why did they set that level?

2166
01:57:37.260 --> 01:57:40.410
It's not because they're smoking crack.

2167
01:57:40.411 --> 01:57:42.480
It's because that's a level where you start seeing a problem.

2168
01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:44.520
Here's one way to know that you got,

2169
01:57:44.670 --> 01:57:47.460
there's like the poor man's mold detector test for your coffee.

2170
01:57:48.030 --> 01:57:52.350
If you drink a cup of coffee and you have to pee soon after you drink it and

2171
01:57:52.351 --> 01:57:57.150
your pee is clear,
that's a really good sign that you got mold toxins.
The reason,

2172
01:57:57.390 --> 01:57:59.640
the reason for that is that those mold toxins,

2173
01:57:59.700 --> 01:58:02.520
Okra toxin is particularly rough on the kidneys and bladder.
In fact,

2174
01:58:02.521 --> 01:58:03.630
it's linked to bladder cancer,

2175
01:58:04.770 --> 01:58:08.970
so your body being pretty smart actually as an evolutionary kind of thing.

2176
01:58:09.360 --> 01:58:13.620
We'll sit there and say,
oh,
I've got this toxin.
It's here.

2177
01:58:13.850 --> 01:58:17.790
Why doesn't it make You pee?
You have to be corn.
It does.
Depending on the corn.

2178
01:58:17.940 --> 01:58:21.900
Corn Makes You pee.
It depends on which you heard that.
Have you noticed?

2179
01:58:21.901 --> 01:58:24.150
Three of the world.
So,
so overheard man,

2180
01:58:24.151 --> 01:58:28.470
I hated it and clunks and I'll like pm you just don't like drinking coffee

2181
01:58:28.471 --> 01:58:31.440
because it makes them p people say caffeine is a diuretic.

2182
01:58:31.441 --> 01:58:34.650
It's a very weak diarrhetic.
What's a very strong diuretic is Okra toxin.

2183
01:58:34.890 --> 01:58:37.910
And wait a minute,
caffeine is a week.
Diarrhea not.

2184
01:58:37.950 --> 01:58:41.710
So when you're drinking red bull and you have to piss like a fucking wild race

2185
01:58:41.711 --> 01:58:43.120
horse,
what's that all about?

2186
01:58:43.121 --> 01:58:46.510
Because there's also oak or toxins is the regular fruit dose in there,

2187
01:58:46.511 --> 01:58:48.940
isn't there?
Fruit Toes makes you pee well.

2188
01:58:48.941 --> 01:58:52.330
So fructose is one of those things that causes advanced glycation end products

2189
01:58:52.331 --> 01:58:55.000
in the body.
It's one of the most damaging sugars to deal with.

2190
01:58:55.210 --> 01:58:57.880
So your body really wants to flush toxins out as fast as it can.

2191
01:58:58.060 --> 01:59:00.760
So whenever you have something that makes you have to pee and pee clear,

2192
01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:04.480
as long as you haven't been like chugging gallons and gallons of water just to

2193
01:59:04.481 --> 01:59:08.920
dilute your pee that way,
what's going on there?
Is your body pulled hydration,

2194
01:59:08.921 --> 01:59:10.390
pull water out of your tissues?

2195
01:59:10.510 --> 01:59:14.380
Put it into your kidneys and bladder so it could reduce the concentration.

2196
01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:17.500
You want to dilute the talks as much as possible and then pee it out as soon as

2197
01:59:17.501 --> 01:59:18.100
possible.

2198
01:59:18.100 --> 01:59:21.550
So what you'll find when you pee and it's clear you're not peeing like to two

2199
01:59:21.551 --> 01:59:24.190
gallons of water,
you have to pee.
It's clear Pete,

2200
01:59:24.220 --> 01:59:26.470
it's your body saying excrete the toxins faster,

2201
01:59:26.471 --> 01:59:29.050
excrete them faster and if you just look at the color,
your pee,

2202
01:59:29.051 --> 01:59:30.700
how often you pee in the volume of your pee,

2203
01:59:30.820 --> 01:59:34.450
you can pretty much tell whether you had toxins and then previous several hours.

2204
01:59:34.690 --> 01:59:36.280
So you think that it's,

2205
01:59:36.340 --> 01:59:39.740
it's actually the fructose that's making people pay when they drink red.

2206
01:59:39.741 --> 01:59:41.540
It just doesn't make you have to pee more.
I'm calf.

2207
01:59:41.541 --> 01:59:45.340
Kathleen has seen has an unquestioning.
I'm not saying caffeine is a diuretic.

2208
01:59:45.341 --> 01:59:47.530
Yeah,
I'm absolutely saying it is a diuretic.

2209
01:59:47.560 --> 01:59:50.020
It's just not as strong a diuretic as bad coffee.

2210
01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:52.990
That the extra big boosts like the super urgent.

2211
01:59:52.991 --> 01:59:54.970
Having to pee is a different feeling.

2212
01:59:54.971 --> 01:59:58.450
Then I need to pee more than I had to pee before.
And if you use a week diuretic,

2213
01:59:58.470 --> 02:00:00.910
your p using is going to be more yellow than it is white.

2214
02:00:00.970 --> 02:00:03.670
Because I find that when I drink red bull's like if I work for the UFC,

2215
02:00:03.671 --> 02:00:07.180
if I drink a red bull,
God Damn,
I got to pee like quickly,

2216
02:00:07.270 --> 02:00:09.340
but I can drink a cup of coffee and be fine.

2217
02:00:09.430 --> 02:00:11.980
I'd have to see what else is in there.
But there's the,
there's the difference.

2218
02:00:12.190 --> 02:00:16.300
Red Bull versus coffee,
like tell with corn.

2219
02:00:16.301 --> 02:00:20.950
Then how do you tell the mycotoxins that are on grain if you're eating on a
Taco,

2220
02:00:20.980 --> 02:00:23.590
okay,
it's got corn in there,
it's got meat from grain fed animals,

2221
02:00:23.770 --> 02:00:26.140
and we can talk about how grain fed animals accumulate.

2222
02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:29.830
This one talks to the commute a lot to the toxins from molds in their food.

2223
02:00:30.050 --> 02:00:32.560
We talked about it earlier with,
oh,
that's true.

2224
02:00:32.561 --> 02:00:34.820
What we did with the grass fed and grain fed.
So there you go.
Yeah.

2225
02:00:34.870 --> 02:00:37.360
And there's some seasonal effects there too,
like especially in pork.

2226
02:00:37.570 --> 02:00:40.030
And so you get all this stuff stacked up and then you're like,
okay,

2227
02:00:40.031 --> 02:00:43.060
I ate this meal.
End of the day was the meat like deep fried or not.

2228
02:00:43.061 --> 02:00:45.490
All of those have different like heck heterocyclic amines,

2229
02:00:45.491 --> 02:00:48.460
acrylamide all these things form.
So your body's going to say,
all right,

2230
02:00:48.610 --> 02:00:51.430
taking all this stuff in as a,
as a total,

2231
02:00:51.431 --> 02:00:54.700
including what was the ratio of protein versus fat and protein versus carbs.

2232
02:00:54.700 --> 02:00:56.860
Too much protein makes you have to pay more to get that out too.

2233
02:00:57.160 --> 02:00:59.080
So it's going to do all that and it's going to do something.

2234
02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:03.250
But if you eat a meal of just corn or just corn and a couple of things like corn

2235
02:01:03.251 --> 02:01:05.140
and butter,
you know,
butter doesn't make,
I have to pee.

2236
02:01:05.800 --> 02:01:07.690
You may notice a difference.
You may not too.

2237
02:01:07.691 --> 02:01:11.620
There's probably also some individual sensitivities there around like allergies

2238
02:01:11.621 --> 02:01:14.560
to corn and xen and whether the corners genetically modified or not.

2239
02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:17.020
But the main point is that if you have to pee urgently,

2240
02:01:17.150 --> 02:01:21.160
you look at what you just did in the previous half hour to two hours maybe.

2241
02:01:21.370 --> 02:01:22.720
And you're very likely to say,
wait,

2242
02:01:22.750 --> 02:01:25.180
there's something in there that was different than the time before because it's

2243
02:01:25.181 --> 02:01:28.030
not normal to go.
I have to pee right now.
If you're getting that,

2244
02:01:28.060 --> 02:01:29.740
there's something going on in your body.

2245
02:01:29.740 --> 02:01:33.820
Anybody saying get this crap out of here.
Is it okay to grow your own corn?

2246
02:01:33.850 --> 02:01:37.330
Can you like grow your own corn and eat that or will that have mycotoxins on it

2247
02:01:37.331 --> 02:01:38.380
as well?
I think so.

2248
02:01:38.470 --> 02:01:42.320
The difficulty with fresh corn is that as soon as you pick it,

2249
02:01:42.590 --> 02:01:45.410
you want it like blanch it and freeze it,
which is what we traditionally did.

2250
02:01:45.440 --> 02:01:49.910
You get frozen corn on the cob if you're going to go to,
yeah.
Why?
Well,

2251
02:01:49.911 --> 02:01:53.480
if you blanch it and freeze it,
then it's,
it doesn't decompose it all.

2252
02:01:53.481 --> 02:01:57.830
You get perfectly fresh.
Corn is,
it tastes just as good as if it was fresh.
Uh,

2253
02:01:57.831 --> 02:01:59.030
it depends how you're going to cook it.

2254
02:01:59.031 --> 02:02:00.730
And one of my favorite ways of doing corners.

2255
02:02:00.740 --> 02:02:03.770
You get fresh organic corn that was literally pick the day before,

2256
02:02:03.771 --> 02:02:05.240
hopefully packed and crushed ice.

2257
02:02:05.241 --> 02:02:08.930
Like that's what the farmer's market should be doing when they bring that stuff

2258
02:02:08.931 --> 02:02:12.230
in.
And then you take that and just toss it on the grill and like let it steam

2259
02:02:12.231 --> 02:02:14.900
inside the inside the Husk,
like it's amazing.

2260
02:02:15.510 --> 02:02:18.620
Roll it in a whole bunch of butter that's going to be pretty darn safe.

2261
02:02:18.621 --> 02:02:20.660
But if that same stuff was two or three days old,

2262
02:02:20.661 --> 02:02:22.160
like it might be in the grocery store and you know,

2263
02:02:22.161 --> 02:02:25.750
the outside's a little bit kind of crinkled,
looking a little gray.
Uh,

2264
02:02:25.760 --> 02:02:28.700
I actually noticed a big difference from that.
Granted,
I'm a canary,

2265
02:02:28.910 --> 02:02:30.770
but if I feel a huge difference,

2266
02:02:30.860 --> 02:02:35.030
there's a difference in the toxin level and what I'm learning in the course of,

2267
02:02:35.031 --> 02:02:39.560
of just writing this and having all these people come to the website and shared

2268
02:02:39.561 --> 02:02:43.970
experiences,
they're there,
they're noticing the same thing.
It's like,
wow,

2269
02:02:43.971 --> 02:02:46.910
I got really tired after that meal and I don't normally get really tired.

2270
02:02:46.911 --> 02:02:49.010
Like what could have caused it.
And then we trace it back and I'm like,

2271
02:02:49.011 --> 02:02:52.430
well here's the most likely mold toxin containing things in there.

2272
02:02:52.431 --> 02:02:56.000
Why don't you experiment with those?
Eat those again.
And it's like wow.

2273
02:02:56.030 --> 02:02:58.700
Like it was,
it was that batch of cashews.
That's what messed me up.

2274
02:02:58.701 --> 02:02:59.331
I didn't understand.

2275
02:02:59.331 --> 02:03:01.970
I lost two hours of productive time today cause I was eating a bad batch of

2276
02:03:01.971 --> 02:03:06.630
cashews.
It happens like that's the nature of food and it's nuts.

2277
02:03:06.970 --> 02:03:10.880
It's nuts and grains,
all the good stuff.

2278
02:03:11.270 --> 02:03:14.540
Do you think that they're going to ever have a method to weed that stuff out and

2279
02:03:14.541 --> 02:03:19.190
find out how to give people a healthy food and we have this as an issue.

2280
02:03:19.220 --> 02:03:23.750
We have the methods.
Okay,
but why don't you,
let me rephrase it then.

2281
02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:27.050
Do you ever think there's going to be a time where this is applied?

2282
02:03:27.051 --> 02:03:29.030
Stuff like this is going to be right now,

2283
02:03:29.031 --> 02:03:33.080
this is a pretty fringe conversation as far as like the mainstream ideas of of

2284
02:03:33.081 --> 02:03:37.260
health and nutrition.
If you talk to a food safety scientist,
you talk to CDC,

2285
02:03:37.261 --> 02:03:41.330
you talk to Fda,
they have mold toxin,
they have salmon Nela,

2286
02:03:41.331 --> 02:03:44.150
they have equal light and they have specialists who are tracking all this stuff.

2287
02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:48.080
The problem is that testing is spotty.
Sampling is a difficult thing to do.

2288
02:03:48.110 --> 02:03:51.920
Like how many samples can you take from where things change over time,

2289
02:03:52.070 --> 02:03:53.510
like those bins where you're,

2290
02:03:53.660 --> 02:03:56.330
you're storing stuff in the bulk section at the grocery store.

2291
02:03:56.510 --> 02:03:58.010
How often are those bins cleaned out?

2292
02:03:58.011 --> 02:04:01.100
Because a lot of this contamination happens.
If you test it after it's picked,

2293
02:04:01.310 --> 02:04:02.143
it's pretty clean.

2294
02:04:02.300 --> 02:04:05.750
You put it in a dirty silo during storage before it's packaged up in that

2295
02:04:05.751 --> 02:04:09.200
organic store where you go to,
it's going to pick up mold spores.
They're,

2296
02:04:09.201 --> 02:04:11.910
and they're going to keep growing on the dried stuff unless you controlled

2297
02:04:11.930 --> 02:04:14.750
humidity and temperature and not a lot of the times do people do that.

2298
02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:18.680
So it's just a really complex supply chain and the bottom line is fresh local

2299
02:04:18.681 --> 02:04:20.780
food avoids this problem entirely.

2300
02:04:21.230 --> 02:04:24.560
This is one of the reasons the industrialization of our food supply is creating

2301
02:04:24.561 --> 02:04:28.170
more chronic stress and people,
and this is an uh,

2302
02:04:28.610 --> 02:04:32.210
a problem that is real.
We know it's real and we know about the acute problems.

2303
02:04:32.211 --> 02:04:35.540
People poisoned by mold.
Toxic people get liver cancer from aflatoxin.

2304
02:04:35.780 --> 02:04:38.460
They test aflatoxin and peanut butter because it was such a problem.

2305
02:04:38.910 --> 02:04:42.510
The problem is that there's a difference between it killed you and it knocked

2306
02:04:42.511 --> 02:04:46.050
you down for a week and you went to the hospital and slowly poisoned and I had a

2307
02:04:46.051 --> 02:04:49.020
crappy day.
Have you talked to somebody has mold in their house,

2308
02:04:49.050 --> 02:04:50.130
black mold in the house.

2309
02:04:50.160 --> 02:04:53.780
I had black mold in my house at least two to actually want to do.

2310
02:04:53.820 --> 02:04:55.140
I can count three times in my life.

2311
02:04:55.710 --> 02:04:58.110
I grew up in a basement that had been flooded.

2312
02:04:58.111 --> 02:05:00.960
We didn't know this in the 80s right?
I had nosebleeds 10 times a day.

2313
02:05:00.961 --> 02:05:02.820
It's one of the reasons I'm as sensitive as I am now.

2314
02:05:03.060 --> 02:05:06.150
So literally it all the time and I would get bruises all over my body for no

2315
02:05:06.151 --> 02:05:10.830
reason.
These are signs haunted.
It was going on is getting you in your sleep.

2316
02:05:11.250 --> 02:05:13.880
It could have been that vampire best could have been men,

2317
02:05:13.920 --> 02:05:16.890
vampires and ghosts both like you,
your yummy.
Here's what,

2318
02:05:17.130 --> 02:05:19.890
here's what actually happened as opposed to the ghost theory.

2319
02:05:19.940 --> 02:05:20.773
I like kind of like that one.

2320
02:05:21.960 --> 02:05:26.100
Your body uses vitamin C to make glutathione in the liver will go to the
science,

2321
02:05:26.101 --> 02:05:28.170
the main detoxification enzyme there.

2322
02:05:28.350 --> 02:05:31.530
Your body also uses vitamin C to make Collagen in your tissues.

2323
02:05:31.830 --> 02:05:34.230
Your arteries and veins are made out of Collagen.

2324
02:05:34.620 --> 02:05:38.970
So if you have to make a life and death decision biologically between detoxing

2325
02:05:38.971 --> 02:05:41.490
the liver and building Collagen,
you will always choose,

2326
02:05:41.491 --> 02:05:44.070
protect the liver first because you can always make more college and later.

2327
02:05:44.370 --> 02:05:47.400
So I was shunting all my vitamins c,
I didn't supplement back then.
You know,

2328
02:05:47.401 --> 02:05:52.230
I'm just a kid eating McDonald's and so I would shut whatever vitamin C was in

2329
02:05:52.231 --> 02:05:55.320
my diet directly to my liver to help detox what I was breathing in.

2330
02:05:55.470 --> 02:05:59.550
And it didn't help that I'm one of the 28% with the genes that don't handle
mold,

2331
02:05:59.551 --> 02:06:01.440
especially aerosol mold very well.

2332
02:06:01.950 --> 02:06:05.190
And that's why I was getting bruising because I couldn't hold my blood in my

2333
02:06:05.191 --> 02:06:08.490
nose or here,
you know,
just in in my arms and legs.

2334
02:06:08.491 --> 02:06:10.080
I just have all these bruises where I couldn't,

2335
02:06:10.110 --> 02:06:12.810
I didn't like I was playing soccer,
but no one,
you know,
it sounds good,

2336
02:06:12.811 --> 02:06:17.730
but I'm going with ghosts.
All right,
I'll buy the ghosts.
What does Gludethyon,

2337
02:06:17.731 --> 02:06:18.270
dude,

2338
02:06:18.270 --> 02:06:22.950
Gludethyon is one of the major cellular antioxidants in the body and it's the

2339
02:06:22.951 --> 02:06:27.951
thing that the liver uses for most of its detoxification and a biochemist or a

2340
02:06:28.051 --> 02:06:30.570
biologist going to say,
well,
there's p four 50 pathways,
blah,
blah blah.

2341
02:06:30.600 --> 02:06:34.350
But basically when you drink,
you suck the glue to fine out of your liver.

2342
02:06:34.351 --> 02:06:37.470
And if you run out of Gludethyon,
you start getting alcohol induced liver damage.

2343
02:06:37.920 --> 02:06:41.800
When you take Tylenol,
it causes liver damage if it depletes your glutathione.

2344
02:06:42.300 --> 02:06:46.230
So it's in your best interest to keep your cellular levels are intracellular

2345
02:06:46.231 --> 02:06:49.320
levels and your liver levels of glutathione as high as you can so you can be

2346
02:06:49.321 --> 02:06:52.980
more resilient in the face of toxins.
And as a kid,

2347
02:06:53.040 --> 02:06:56.400
I didn't have very good glutathione because I was taking all of my vitamins c

2348
02:06:56.401 --> 02:06:59.220
and giving it to my liver because I lived in a basement with toxic mold,

2349
02:06:59.250 --> 02:07:00.083
not knowing it,

2350
02:07:00.330 --> 02:07:04.230
but I had all the asthma and add in a lot of these things that are directly tied

2351
02:07:04.231 --> 02:07:06.870
to what I was breathing.
We just didn't know it at the time.

2352
02:07:07.110 --> 02:07:09.330
If we were to all of these different specialists,
no one could say boot,

2353
02:07:09.331 --> 02:07:12.900
but my symptoms line up perfectly and I have all the lab tests showing my immune

2354
02:07:12.901 --> 02:07:16.980
system is magically reactive to like nine of the top 10 most toxic molds.

2355
02:07:17.100 --> 02:07:21.630
So you take glutathione,
you,
you,
you also take college and like what,

2356
02:07:21.640 --> 02:07:24.540
what does you to actually make those things?

2357
02:07:24.750 --> 02:07:27.600
Because I couldn't find a good grass fed collagen out there.

2358
02:07:27.630 --> 02:07:31.050
And so I prefer getting grass fed animals because it's better for the

2359
02:07:31.051 --> 02:07:34.290
environment and it,
it's better in general from a health perspective.

2360
02:07:34.500 --> 02:07:37.300
So I take grass fed,
pre digested hydrolyzed Collagen,

2361
02:07:37.301 --> 02:07:39.960
so you don't even have to digest it.
It just absorbs.
Um,

2362
02:07:39.961 --> 02:07:43.510
I even put that in my bulletproof coffee sometimes if I'm like if I lifted or I

2363
02:07:43.511 --> 02:07:47.770
did something strenuous that day,
once every year,
once a year.
You live,
come on,

2364
02:07:47.771 --> 02:07:52.460
give me credit now.
That's ridiculous.
I've been working out more on the vibe,
uh,

2365
02:07:52.480 --> 02:07:52.841
lately.

2366
02:07:52.841 --> 02:07:55.840
So I've been increasing my protein intake to account for physical activity

2367
02:07:56.140 --> 02:07:59.290
because I've decided I need to like get my sense of section,

2368
02:07:59.291 --> 02:08:02.440
get my body lined up right.
So I'm doing more work on any fixed sun.

2369
02:08:02.590 --> 02:08:05.830
I hear you man.
All right.
And then I take [inaudible],

2370
02:08:05.980 --> 02:08:09.220
and this has been a problem because go to the hands are really complex.

2371
02:08:09.221 --> 02:08:11.380
Sulfur bearing molecule.
It's big.

2372
02:08:11.470 --> 02:08:15.310
So when you eat glue to Phi on it gets digested and you don't get in know it

2373
02:08:15.311 --> 02:08:18.220
doesn't absorb.
So you can take a pill and nothing happens.

2374
02:08:18.520 --> 02:08:21.910
So the old way of doing this was to take vitamin C and an amino acid called

2375
02:08:21.911 --> 02:08:26.140
inositol cysteine.
And these combined maybe with Alpha lipoic acid,

2376
02:08:26.141 --> 02:08:28.660
if you want to be fancy and help you make Lou fine,

2377
02:08:28.690 --> 02:08:30.190
but it's rate limited by an enzyme.

2378
02:08:30.580 --> 02:08:35.580
So the upgraded gludethyon that I make now uses a technique out of,

2379
02:08:36.670 --> 02:08:38.290
uh,
actually the pharmaceutical industry.

2380
02:08:38.620 --> 02:08:43.620
And we encapsulate the glutathione molecule in phosphatidylcholine,

2381
02:08:43.661 --> 02:08:48.661
which is basically a healthy form of the fat that insulates your nerves in your

2382
02:08:48.971 --> 02:08:52.450
body,
loves Coleen.
In fact,
it's one of the things in Alpha brain,

2383
02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:56.650
there's things that help you have more Coleen.
So it loves this stuff.

2384
02:08:56.680 --> 02:08:59.770
And then we tie another molecule into it called the lactoferrin that your immune

2385
02:08:59.771 --> 02:09:02.560
system loves.
So when this hits the wall of your stomach,
your stomach's like,

2386
02:09:02.620 --> 02:09:04.090
oh yeah.
And it sucks it right in,

2387
02:09:04.240 --> 02:09:08.620
which raises the blood levels much higher than you can get via any other method

2388
02:09:08.621 --> 02:09:12.840
that I've experimented with.
And I've done a lot.
I've done Iv Glutathione,
uh,

2389
02:09:12.841 --> 02:09:15.460
actually quite a lot of it,
um,
going back historically,

2390
02:09:15.640 --> 02:09:18.550
but it costs 150 bucks and it takes an hour to inject the stuff.

2391
02:09:18.820 --> 02:09:23.620
So we're getting fantastic results from people who just take this oral stuff.

2392
02:09:24.190 --> 02:09:27.220
And that's what I take and I take it on a regular basis because I want to be

2393
02:09:27.221 --> 02:09:30.520
more resilient.
Number one,
I wasn't born with a very resilient body.

2394
02:09:30.790 --> 02:09:34.250
I have like one kidney,
like I actually have some spinal Bifida,

2395
02:09:34.251 --> 02:09:34.931
I believe it or not.

2396
02:09:34.931 --> 02:09:38.380
Like my lower spine isn't fully fused so I didn't start out strong and I'm

2397
02:09:38.381 --> 02:09:40.650
pretty stoked with where I am.
But I do things like glue to fine.

2398
02:09:40.660 --> 02:09:42.490
I do things like college and like coffee,

2399
02:09:42.640 --> 02:09:46.210
everything I can find on the planet that brings me back to above the level I've

2400
02:09:46.211 --> 02:09:48.150
ever performed before and like go to Diane.

2401
02:09:48.151 --> 02:09:51.070
And understanding as a kid I didn't have enough of it and that affected my

2402
02:09:51.071 --> 02:09:51.904
health,

2403
02:09:52.210 --> 02:09:55.660
made me more aware of its role in the body today so I could do the stuff that

2404
02:09:55.661 --> 02:09:57.130
I'm doing now,
which honestly,

2405
02:09:57.131 --> 02:10:00.130
like I'd take all my own stuff because it works for me.

2406
02:10:00.600 --> 02:10:01.890
<v 0>That's pretty fascinating.
You know,</v>

2407
02:10:01.891 --> 02:10:06.330
a lot of people were skeptical about the possibilities that they're experiencing

2408
02:10:06.331 --> 02:10:11.250
that much issue in their life because of toxins,
because of,
uh,

2409
02:10:11.910 --> 02:10:12.690
things that are,

2410
02:10:12.690 --> 02:10:17.690
that are just naturally in the Diet and a slow sort of a leak of poison into

2411
02:10:19.381 --> 02:10:21.300
your body.
I never even thought about it that way.

2412
02:10:21.810 --> 02:10:24.480
But if you have a house that has fucking black mold in it,

2413
02:10:24.490 --> 02:10:25.830
that is exactly what it's like.

2414
02:10:26.420 --> 02:10:29.960
Have you have a house that you ever talked to someone or you've had it at,

2415
02:10:30.100 --> 02:10:32.280
and have you ever talked to someone who almost died from that?

2416
02:10:32.760 --> 02:10:37.040
I know dude who was like literally thought he had aids and found out that it was

2417
02:10:37.041 --> 02:10:38.270
just some fungus

2418
02:10:38.290 --> 02:10:42.790
<v 4>slipping in his house.
They tested me phrase,
my doctor said to Dave,
look to you.</v>

2419
02:10:42.920 --> 02:10:44.800
He's a fucking,
the guys were all easy.

2420
02:10:46.510 --> 02:10:49.870
This guy was like really an amazing tot.
He said,
Dave,
people don't,

2421
02:10:49.871 --> 02:10:52.420
don't see me as many times you've seen me.
Like,
you're not getting better.

2422
02:10:52.421 --> 02:10:57.010
I don't know what the deal is here.
Uh,
and he tested the heck out of me.
And uh,

2423
02:10:57.011 --> 02:11:00.630
we finally figured out that it was,
it was toxic mold.
How,

2424
02:11:00.750 --> 02:11:05.520
how much of a real issue is that when people get fat is mold or just talk to

2425
02:11:05.530 --> 02:11:08.470
that just sat with outfits and being fat itself.

2426
02:11:08.471 --> 02:11:11.980
How much of an effect it's being overweight.
It has a big effect.
Right?

2427
02:11:12.340 --> 02:11:15.100
That's less of a of two actually.
It can be triggered by toxins,

2428
02:11:15.101 --> 02:11:17.080
but it's more of a metabolic energy thing.

2429
02:11:17.081 --> 02:11:21.700
And that's the other side of what I do.
Uh,
with the supplements that I make.
It's,

2430
02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:26.560
it's about increasing mitochondrial function and if you have a fueling problem

2431
02:11:26.561 --> 02:11:30.430
in energy management problem in your body and being fat as a great sign of that,

2432
02:11:30.640 --> 02:11:33.100
you need to figure out why and you need to correct it.

2433
02:11:33.340 --> 02:11:36.010
Because when your body works well,
you shouldn't be fat.

2434
02:11:36.220 --> 02:11:39.460
Have you noticed this trend where you're not supposed to bring up the fact that

2435
02:11:39.461 --> 02:11:43.150
people were fat and it's called fat shaming?
Wow.

2436
02:11:43.360 --> 02:11:44.650
I've seen some things on Facebook

2437
02:11:45.260 --> 02:11:50.260
<v 0>discussing fat or even better celebrating the fact that you're thin is fat</v>

2438
02:11:50.481 --> 02:11:55.300
shaming.
Wow.
There was a woman fucking people.
What about thin shaming?
Well,

2439
02:11:55.370 --> 02:11:56.151
you know what it is,
man.

2440
02:11:56.151 --> 02:11:59.330
It's just people trying to find some sort of an excuse for why they are the way

2441
02:11:59.331 --> 02:12:00.390
they are and,

2442
02:12:00.430 --> 02:12:04.280
and the excuse to continue to be the way they are without feeling any

2443
02:12:04.281 --> 02:12:07.760
repercussions from socially,
from other people.
This is a woman,

2444
02:12:07.820 --> 02:12:10.280
she had this picture,
she put it on Facebook,
it's her,

2445
02:12:10.281 --> 02:12:12.770
she's in a bikini show or a like a little,
you know,

2446
02:12:12.771 --> 02:12:14.720
one of the little crossfit outfits or something like that.

2447
02:12:15.110 --> 02:12:19.040
And she has her three kids there.
Oh,
I saw that picture.
And the picture says,

2448
02:12:19.580 --> 02:12:24.130
what's your excuse?
And people were saying,
you're fat shaming.

2449
02:12:24.290 --> 02:12:25.370
A lot of people have different lives.

2450
02:12:25.371 --> 02:12:29.030
Like whether or not someone has a different life and whether or not someone has

2451
02:12:29.031 --> 02:12:32.570
a different issue with their body,
that's not what she's saying.
She's saying,

2452
02:12:32.571 --> 02:12:35.990
what's your excuse?
Because this is what she's been able to do.
You're right.

2453
02:12:36.290 --> 02:12:37.760
Everybody's different.
You're right.

2454
02:12:37.761 --> 02:12:41.750
Some people have a bad situation that they're in financially.

2455
02:12:41.900 --> 02:12:46.250
Some people have bad genetics,
some people,
uh,
they've been taught poorly.

2456
02:12:46.310 --> 02:12:50.540
Whatever diseases,
all the above.
But that's not fat shaming.

2457
02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:53.900
She's celebrating the fact that she's thin.
You know,
and this,

2458
02:12:54.020 --> 02:12:59.020
this fat shaming thing that people love to say now is it completely alleviates

2459
02:12:59.511 --> 02:13:04.100
any responsibility you have for your own physical shape.
It's like they want it.

2460
02:13:04.101 --> 02:13:09.101
They want to take it out of the equation that that social aspect of being fat,

2461
02:13:09.291 --> 02:13:13.580
like there's a reason for it.
The reason for it is it's not healthy for you.

2462
02:13:13.581 --> 02:13:16.730
There's the girl.
If you look at that picture up there,
what's your excuse?
Yeah,

2463
02:13:18.080 --> 02:13:23.080
but there's a reason why that exists is because people see what you're doing and

2464
02:13:23.241 --> 02:13:26.240
they don't like the way it looks on you because they're scared of it being on

2465
02:13:26.241 --> 02:13:29.420
them.
When someone sees a,
in a morbidly obese person,

2466
02:13:29.540 --> 02:13:32.190
the reason why they're staring,
it's not going to to shame that person.

2467
02:13:32.340 --> 02:13:36.720
It's a natural freak out.
Your body recognizes,
oh shit,

2468
02:13:36.870 --> 02:13:41.070
that's possible too.
I could do that.
God Damn,
I better not do that.

2469
02:13:41.160 --> 02:13:43.950
I don't want to do that.
That guy looks,
it looks awful.
Oh my God,

2470
02:13:43.951 --> 02:13:46.230
that guy's going to die.
That's not fat shaming.

2471
02:13:46.320 --> 02:13:51.320
That's a natural thing that people do with a recognize success and failure in

2472
02:13:52.021 --> 02:13:56.550
their environment and that success and failure is as much social success and

2473
02:13:56.551 --> 02:13:59.400
failure as it is physiological health.

2474
02:13:59.430 --> 02:14:01.950
If you see someone that's super unhealthy,

2475
02:14:02.130 --> 02:14:05.510
coughing and smoking a cigarette,
eh,

2476
02:14:05.640 --> 02:14:09.390
that feeling is not cigarette smoking shaming.
Okay.

2477
02:14:09.540 --> 02:14:13.860
That feeling is you're recognized and that someone is doing something incredibly

2478
02:14:13.861 --> 02:14:17.720
unhealthy and that possibility exists for you too.
Here's,

2479
02:14:17.870 --> 02:14:21.860
<v 4>here's the thing Joe.
That feeling is not a rational response.</v>

2480
02:14:21.861 --> 02:14:25.010
It's a self defense system in the body that happens before you even think about

2481
02:14:25.011 --> 02:14:26.820
it.
This is the body going like,

2482
02:14:27.020 --> 02:14:30.350
like naturally animals don't want to spend time with other sick animals either.

2483
02:14:30.351 --> 02:14:34.630
Like they'll move away from the sick ones and when we see someone,
when our body,

2484
02:14:34.780 --> 02:14:36.860
our meat operating systems see someone who is sick,

2485
02:14:36.861 --> 02:14:41.060
we naturally want to create space.
But here's the thing,
so I weighed 300 pounds.

2486
02:14:41.061 --> 02:14:43.400
I was fat for like half of my life and let me tell you,

2487
02:14:43.401 --> 02:14:45.590
every fat person on earth knows they're fat.

2488
02:14:45.650 --> 02:14:48.920
They do not feel happy about it and they desperately want to fix it.

2489
02:14:49.010 --> 02:14:51.730
<v 0>Well they don't want you to rub it in their face Dave Asprey cause that's fat</v>

2490
02:14:51.731 --> 02:14:54.730
shaming.
You make me feel bad.
If you show your six pack,

2491
02:14:54.940 --> 02:14:57.400
if you just pull that up like 15 minutes a month,

2492
02:14:57.401 --> 02:15:02.020
pitch boom and show that six pack on on Instagram,
you're fat shaming.

2493
02:15:03.090 --> 02:15:07.600
That's good.
Fucking workout every morning,
an hour and a half a day.

2494
02:15:07.601 --> 02:15:08.650
Get yourself in shape,

2495
02:15:08.830 --> 02:15:12.340
take a picture and people will be angry because they didn't.

2496
02:15:12.940 --> 02:15:17.170
That's amazing.
There will be the pride of course,

2497
02:15:17.171 --> 02:15:18.670
but they're saying you're fat shaming.

2498
02:15:18.730 --> 02:15:21.940
<v 4>They're angry because they're trying desperately stuff that doesn't work and</v>

2499
02:15:21.941 --> 02:15:25.840
when it doesn't,
not often.
There's some people who just have given up

2500
02:15:26.240 --> 02:15:30.320
<v 0>most,
I would say most people who are talking about fat shaming or just stuffy</v>

2501
02:15:30.321 --> 02:15:31.760
Twinkies down there,
fucking mug.

2502
02:15:31.880 --> 02:15:35.380
<v 4>The people talking about fat shaming have emotional issues.
I would</v>

2503
02:15:35.430 --> 02:15:39.510
<v 0>gas,
but you didn't find support online.
That's what I find fascinating.</v>

2504
02:15:39.660 --> 02:15:40.830
People who agree with them.

2505
02:15:41.010 --> 02:15:44.850
The people that called that woman a fat shamer who was a lot of them and then

2506
02:15:44.851 --> 02:15:49.780
she,
she had to apologize,
but she was disingenuous in her apology.
I just,
I,

2507
02:15:50.250 --> 02:15:53.460
I feel a lot of compassion.
I should explain.
Washington was disingenuous.

2508
02:15:53.580 --> 02:15:57.570
She did some interview where she was talking about,
you know,
like when she said,

2509
02:15:57.571 --> 02:15:58.830
what's your excuse?

2510
02:15:58.980 --> 02:16:03.980
Like she can't came up with some sort of a real softening down version of what

2511
02:16:04.081 --> 02:16:06.960
she meant by what's your excuse,
you know,

2512
02:16:06.980 --> 02:16:11.520
what she meant is she's not fat.
Look,
I'm hot.
What's your excuse?
Here's my kids.

2513
02:16:11.521 --> 02:16:14.460
I'm a hot,
it's pretty obvious what she meant.
And she was like,

2514
02:16:14.461 --> 02:16:17.360
what's your excuse for not meeting your goals or whatnot?

2515
02:16:18.490 --> 02:16:21.520
<v 4>I kind of get mad though when people say your excuses that you're lazy and</v>

2516
02:16:21.521 --> 02:16:23.980
you're excuses that you didn't work out enough and you didn't die it enough.

2517
02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.680
Cause I too,
I beat myself up.
I broke my metabolism,

2518
02:16:26.681 --> 02:16:29.590
I broke my thyroid gland working out all the time,
eating low fat,

2519
02:16:29.591 --> 02:16:32.800
low calorie diet and all it did was make me fat and sick and tired.

2520
02:16:32.910 --> 02:16:35.140
Like it doesn't work.
So it,
it's,

2521
02:16:35.320 --> 02:16:38.650
it's really annoying when you get these people who are genetically gifted,

2522
02:16:38.651 --> 02:16:42.220
have a good metabolism and never got a chronic illness or whatever the heck

2523
02:16:42.520 --> 02:16:45.490
works.
So they could basically look good without too much work.

2524
02:16:45.700 --> 02:16:48.010
And they stand up there and say,
you know,
you didn't do enough of this.

2525
02:16:48.011 --> 02:16:51.040
But when the fat people try and go for a jog,
when you weigh 300 pounds,

2526
02:16:51.041 --> 02:16:53.500
he's trying to go for a jog.
It's destructive on your tissues.

2527
02:16:53.770 --> 02:16:57.130
So you get all these fat people who are trying and just failing miserably and

2528
02:16:57.131 --> 02:17:00.310
feeling bad about themselves cause they did it because they got the wrong
advice.

2529
02:17:00.420 --> 02:17:02.650
Like that's why I started just putting some of this stuff up there.

2530
02:17:02.890 --> 02:17:05.290
I don't have to work,
I don't have food cravings,

2531
02:17:05.380 --> 02:17:08.140
all that stuff I struggled with like for a lot of my life.

2532
02:17:08.170 --> 02:17:10.600
It just isn't something I have to think about it anymore.

2533
02:17:10.990 --> 02:17:13.890
And it kind of upsets me when I see,
you know,

2534
02:17:13.920 --> 02:17:17.770
fat people who are feeling guilty and like fighting all their willpower on
these,

2535
02:17:17.830 --> 02:17:22.120
on these cravings that cause like they're doing it wrong but they don't know

2536
02:17:22.121 --> 02:17:24.130
they're doing it wrong so that then they feel guilty and they get caught in all

2537
02:17:24.131 --> 02:17:27.190
this emotional stuff and like it's unnecessary.
Yeah.

2538
02:17:27.191 --> 02:17:32.191
It seems like there's gotta be a way to get healthy food to people and make it a

2539
02:17:33.191 --> 02:17:35.560
part of everyone's everyday diet.

2540
02:17:36.130 --> 02:17:40.780
But then you start considering the numbers of people in Los Angeles and there's

2541
02:17:40.781 --> 02:17:45.670
20 million people and getting everybody grasp red beef and getting everybody and

2542
02:17:45.671 --> 02:17:49.300
see tea oil take over.
Some golf courses are gonna have to put cows on them.

2543
02:17:49.390 --> 02:17:50.410
Is that what they're going to have to do?

2544
02:17:50.650 --> 02:17:52.370
You could feed an awful lot of cows and some of these crops,

2545
02:17:52.371 --> 02:17:53.920
you're not going to stop people from golfing.

2546
02:17:53.980 --> 02:17:55.450
It's too many rich dudes like golfing.

2547
02:17:56.210 --> 02:17:59.530
I needs to be a fast food company and it just takes over and just starts doing

2548
02:17:59.531 --> 02:18:02.470
it because that's the biggest problem is people just need fast food.

2549
02:18:03.340 --> 02:18:06.010
Fast food is actually healthy.
There's a couple of attempts.

2550
02:18:06.070 --> 02:18:07.600
There's a guy from uh,

2551
02:18:07.630 --> 02:18:11.620
one of the early whole foods guys and some Mcdonald's guys got together and like

2552
02:18:11.890 --> 02:18:14.070
they'll make something that's uh,
I,

2553
02:18:14.250 --> 02:18:15.820
I'm forgetting the name of what they're trying to do,

2554
02:18:15.821 --> 02:18:17.380
but they'll make something that's better than it was.

2555
02:18:17.380 --> 02:18:20.710
But is it going to be non GMO even?
Is it going to be gluten free now?

2556
02:18:20.711 --> 02:18:23.950
Probably not because we have to understand the core tenants of what makes us

2557
02:18:23.951 --> 02:18:27.190
healthy and we have to understand those widely before there's demand for them.

2558
02:18:27.850 --> 02:18:32.470
So the number one predictor for whether you're going to be obese or not is your

2559
02:18:32.471 --> 02:18:35.110
income level.
The poorer you are,
the fatter you are.

2560
02:18:35.140 --> 02:18:39.820
That's especially true in America and that's a food quality issue and it,
it's,

2561
02:18:40.150 --> 02:18:43.780
it's just not fair the way things are set up that way.
But if you're poor,

2562
02:18:43.781 --> 02:18:46.150
you have a hard time getting food that doesn't make you inflamed,

2563
02:18:46.151 --> 02:18:47.110
it doesn't break your insulin,

2564
02:18:47.111 --> 02:18:51.730
it doesn't contain things that make you weak in it and like it's,
it's tragic.

2565
02:18:51.731 --> 02:18:53.140
It shouldn't be that way.
But that's how it is.

2566
02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:57.880
There's a blog I read about Finn privilege just to sit there.

2567
02:18:57.881 --> 02:19:00.610
That's another thing.
That's another way of saying fat shaming.

2568
02:19:00.970 --> 02:19:05.080
The other side of saying fat shaming is that being thin you are enjoying thin

2569
02:19:05.081 --> 02:19:09.230
privilege and that by like dating success and all that,
oh,

2570
02:19:09.290 --> 02:19:13.660
not just dating success but the way people dress you and the way you move around

2571
02:19:13.661 --> 02:19:17.800
in society that you enjoy thin privilege and what they're trying to do is

2572
02:19:17.801 --> 02:19:22.801
compare being in shape with being a white male like white male privilege is

2573
02:19:23.441 --> 02:19:26.410
white male privilege is almost shameful.
You know,

2574
02:19:26.411 --> 02:19:28.070
it's almost shameful to have this white

2575
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:32.980
<v 0>male privilege while people are still,
it's,
it makes you feel,
uh,
like the,
the,</v>

2576
02:19:32.990 --> 02:19:36.050
like if someone talks about white male privilege,
what do you think of,

2577
02:19:36.230 --> 02:19:39.710
you think of someone being aloof to the concerns of,

2578
02:19:39.780 --> 02:19:44.780
of Brown people and poor people and racism and also aloof to the fact that they

2579
02:19:46.431 --> 02:19:51.431
got super lucky they got this lucky roll the dice and were born in this way that

2580
02:19:52.521 --> 02:19:56.570
allows them to be,
I mean if you think about white males,

2581
02:19:56.980 --> 02:19:59.210
think about white males and you think about wealth.

2582
02:19:59.530 --> 02:20:02.870
Majority of the like super wealthy people are white males.

2583
02:20:03.050 --> 02:20:05.510
The majority of the people that are in positions of power,

2584
02:20:05.511 --> 02:20:07.970
whether it's presidents,
mayors,
white males,

2585
02:20:08.180 --> 02:20:11.570
so that white male being a white male and have that privilege is almost like

2586
02:20:11.571 --> 02:20:15.470
being in a pig.
It's like being the man.
So thin privilege.

2587
02:20:15.680 --> 02:20:18.470
They've figured out a way to make being thin,
being a pig

2588
02:20:20.410 --> 02:20:24.180
<v 4>that is so thin,
privileged,
not on fat,
not I'm lazy,</v>

2589
02:20:24.200 --> 02:20:27.100
not I really food like just you know,

2590
02:20:27.101 --> 02:20:30.220
re re re renaming words to mean something.

2591
02:20:30.280 --> 02:20:34.330
<v 0>Yes,
it's,
it's a little bit of that but it's also,
it's um,
you pulled up the blog,</v>

2592
02:20:34.331 --> 02:20:35.590
right?
Brian did you pull up one of the blocks?

2593
02:20:36.070 --> 02:20:40.690
It's also alleviating themselves a person responsibility and finding a new

2594
02:20:40.691 --> 02:20:42.970
victim or a new,
a new culprit.

2595
02:20:43.090 --> 02:20:48.090
And the culprit is not their own lack of self respect or their own willpower or

2596
02:20:48.461 --> 02:20:52.480
their own ability to discipline themselves or their own ability to educate

2597
02:20:52.481 --> 02:20:54.880
themselves on proper nutrition that's out of the equation.

2598
02:20:55.270 --> 02:20:57.790
No longer their responsibility.
Now instead,

2599
02:20:57.791 --> 02:21:00.840
they'll concentrate on thin people having,
uh,

2600
02:21:00.850 --> 02:21:04.420
an acid fits in an actual airplane seat.
And you know,

2601
02:21:04.570 --> 02:21:08.440
being able to squeeze on an actual escalator,
you know,

2602
02:21:08.441 --> 02:21:11.950
all of these things that these fat fucks are complaining about and calling

2603
02:21:11.951 --> 02:21:12.200
[inaudible]

2604
02:21:12.200 --> 02:21:14.360
<v 4>privilege,
you've gotta knock willpower of that list.</v>

2605
02:21:14.600 --> 02:21:19.250
There is no lack of willpower and fat people.
You willpower's a finite resource.

2606
02:21:19.280 --> 02:21:21.620
You have so much against,
we prove this beyond a doubt.

2607
02:21:21.770 --> 02:21:24.560
What do you mean willpower?
There's a whole book about this now,

2608
02:21:24.561 --> 02:21:26.960
and I'm of course for getting the name of the author,

2609
02:21:27.230 --> 02:21:30.140
but they actually showed that there's so many decisions you can make.

2610
02:21:30.180 --> 02:21:31.340
I wrote about this a while back.

2611
02:21:31.341 --> 02:21:34.490
There's decision making fatigue and there's x amount of willpower and you can

2612
02:21:34.491 --> 02:21:35.990
apply that willpower to change the world.

2613
02:21:36.050 --> 02:21:39.020
Or you can apply that willpower to say no to the bowl of chips in front of you,

2614
02:21:39.530 --> 02:21:42.740
right?
And if you're a fat person and your energy reserves are low,

2615
02:21:42.741 --> 02:21:44.270
and I say this from personal experience,

2616
02:21:44.450 --> 02:21:48.740
the amount of willpower it takes to get up off the couch and walk across the

2617
02:21:48.741 --> 02:21:50.060
street and do whatever you're going to do,

2618
02:21:50.090 --> 02:21:52.970
it requires a hell of a lot more where power,
more willpower,

2619
02:21:52.971 --> 02:21:56.600
then you would think it would as a healthy person because your cells aren't

2620
02:21:56.601 --> 02:21:57.770
working,
you don't have the energy,

2621
02:21:57.771 --> 02:22:00.890
and yet you get up and you do it in every step you take is sapping your

2622
02:22:00.891 --> 02:22:04.430
willpower in a way a healthy person doesn't have,
oh,
I see what you're saying.

2623
02:22:04.430 --> 02:22:05.120
Yeah.

2624
02:22:05.120 --> 02:22:05.953
<v 0>Sang that.</v>

2625
02:22:06.380 --> 02:22:11.300
Even though willpower is sort of an individual characteristic and some people

2626
02:22:11.301 --> 02:22:14.090
having,
some people don't.
With fat people,

2627
02:22:14.091 --> 02:22:18.740
it's almost like a catch 22 because the,
although they need it to drop away,

2628
02:22:18.920 --> 02:22:22.150
they're not going to have it because they needed to just move around.
Yeah,
yeah.

2629
02:22:22.160 --> 02:22:22.450
Their

2630
02:22:22.450 --> 02:22:26.250
<v 4>energy levels are lower so they have less willpower and they're using the</v>

2631
02:22:26.251 --> 02:22:29.580
willpower to do simple things that are effortless for you and it's not

2632
02:22:29.581 --> 02:22:30.750
effortless for a fat person.

2633
02:22:30.780 --> 02:22:33.870
That is such an interesting point and one that I really didn't consider.

2634
02:22:34.290 --> 02:22:38.850
That's a very unique point because I never really considered that fat people

2635
02:22:39.090 --> 02:22:42.120
like,
it's almost like they can't help themselves.

2636
02:22:42.150 --> 02:22:47.150
It's almost like there's so well or it's so much more difficult for them to pass

2637
02:22:47.221 --> 02:22:50.940
on shitty food than it is a regular person.
Well,
think of it like this.
Okay.

2638
02:22:50.941 --> 02:22:55.941
If you're a regular person that's thin privilege so that people are real people.

2639
02:22:57.240 --> 02:23:01.940
So now it's a trainee thing.
Let's pretend that you're a fat person,
Joe,
and,

2640
02:23:01.950 --> 02:23:05.840
and we have a Bagel sitting here.
Okay,
good luck.
Pretend to bitch.
Sorry.

2641
02:23:07.250 --> 02:23:09.510
Can't help myself.
So if the jokes,

2642
02:23:09.511 --> 02:23:13.550
they're the bagels can be talking to you over and over since I eat me and a

2643
02:23:13.551 --> 02:23:17.430
healthy person says,
I don't actually have a craving like fuck you Bagel.
Right?

2644
02:23:17.670 --> 02:23:20.310
But if you're not that guy,
I love bagels.
If you're a fat person,

2645
02:23:20.311 --> 02:23:22.770
that Bagel is going to constantly sit there and go eat me,
eat me,
eat me.

2646
02:23:22.771 --> 02:23:25.590
And every time you say consciously,
I'm not gonna eat the Bagel,

2647
02:23:25.680 --> 02:23:27.900
you are spending your willpower.
Wantonly.

2648
02:23:27.990 --> 02:23:31.500
So every time you see an ad for Mars on,
on TV number,
Mars bars,

2649
02:23:31.501 --> 02:23:33.950
or whatever the heck the latest candy is,
and you're like,

2650
02:23:33.960 --> 02:23:34.950
I kind of got a craving know.

2651
02:23:35.220 --> 02:23:38.820
So you spend your entire day saying no to your biological systems that are

2652
02:23:38.821 --> 02:23:43.490
starving for energy.
And this is why you're not depleted.

2653
02:23:43.590 --> 02:23:45.480
You're not lacking willpower.

2654
02:23:45.481 --> 02:23:48.720
You're wasting your willpower saying no to foods that are calling out to you and

2655
02:23:48.721 --> 02:23:52.380
to biologically unnatural way cause your energy systems are broken,
broken,

2656
02:23:52.381 --> 02:23:55.650
and you have less willpower then you should have had because your cells aren't

2657
02:23:55.651 --> 02:23:57.240
functioning right,
your hormones are broken.

2658
02:23:57.660 --> 02:24:02.070
So it never say that fat people are fat because of a lack of willpower.

2659
02:24:02.160 --> 02:24:05.070
The fact that they're walking is a testament to their willpower.

2660
02:24:05.370 --> 02:24:08.040
What they're lacking is knowledge and they're lacking tools.

2661
02:24:08.041 --> 02:24:09.330
And when fat people have those things,

2662
02:24:09.360 --> 02:24:13.080
they immediately go and they get thin again.
Okay.
But if that's the case,

2663
02:24:13.170 --> 02:24:18.000
then what makes someone go out of their way and get that knowledge?

2664
02:24:18.001 --> 02:24:19.740
What makes someone changed their diet?

2665
02:24:19.760 --> 02:24:22.260
What makes someone make the difficult steps to start going to a gym?

2666
02:24:22.830 --> 02:24:25.410
It's kind of willpower.
Dave Asprey.
There's,

2667
02:24:25.590 --> 02:24:27.510
there's definitely willpower component to it,

2668
02:24:27.630 --> 02:24:31.350
but things like social support will increase the amount of willpower you have.

2669
02:24:31.351 --> 02:24:34.860
Things like encouragement and also things like like dying or being disabled or

2670
02:24:34.861 --> 02:24:37.650
finding a diabetic ulcer on your leg and your doctor telling you you're going to

2671
02:24:37.651 --> 02:24:39.360
lose your leg if you don't work your ass out.

2672
02:24:39.870 --> 02:24:42.840
That can temporarily increase willpower enough that you get your cellular

2673
02:24:42.870 --> 02:24:44.190
cellular energy kicked off.

2674
02:24:44.430 --> 02:24:47.550
But what if you use that willpower and you go on a Ravi and diet,
dude,

2675
02:24:47.880 --> 02:24:49.620
you're going to crash.
You might actually lose some weight,

2676
02:24:49.621 --> 02:24:53.610
but you'll end up wrecking your health even more over the next probably one to

2677
02:24:53.611 --> 02:24:57.030
two years.
So what is missing from a raw vegan diet?

2678
02:24:57.780 --> 02:25:01.350
What's missing from Ravi and diet is saturated fat.

2679
02:25:01.860 --> 02:25:03.300
And you can say you get it from coconut oil,

2680
02:25:03.301 --> 02:25:05.310
but you don't get all of it from coconut oil.

2681
02:25:05.580 --> 02:25:09.210
All of those things that you find in the nice yellow rind of fat and things you

2682
02:25:09.211 --> 02:25:13.650
find in oysters and things you find in liver trace nutrients,
iron,
vitamin B,

2683
02:25:13.651 --> 02:25:17.910
12 and can't supplement these things.
You can't supplement those things,

2684
02:25:17.970 --> 02:25:21.330
although I don't know where we're going to get vitamin D without relying on

2685
02:25:21.331 --> 02:25:24.040
animal products unless you get the sunburns.
Shataki

2686
02:25:24.040 --> 02:25:27.820
<v 1>mushrooms is like one source,
a little bit of Sunburns,
Shataki Mushrooms,</v>

2687
02:25:27.821 --> 02:25:31.800
the only vegan vitamin D that we know how to make wow is to take sure talkies,

2688
02:25:32.140 --> 02:25:32.591
pick them,

2689
02:25:32.591 --> 02:25:35.650
turn them over and expose them to UV and they make a small amount of vitamin D.

2690
02:25:35.890 --> 02:25:38.320
So it's the only,
otherwise you need.

2691
02:25:38.321 --> 02:25:42.160
How many ship talkies do you have to eat to be healthy then a Shataki load.

2692
02:25:42.670 --> 02:25:45.730
Ah,
you son of a gun.

2693
02:25:45.731 --> 02:25:49.000
You how was coming?
That was covered.
It's pretty good.

2694
02:25:49.001 --> 02:25:53.470
Dave Aspery that's almost like we said that up in advance.
Wow.

2695
02:25:53.471 --> 02:25:58.000
So vitamin D is a critical issue with,
uh,
with vegans.
It,
it is,

2696
02:25:58.001 --> 02:26:00.040
and maybe they're outside suntanning all the time.

2697
02:26:00.041 --> 02:26:04.480
This is fucking poor kid who goes to school with my kid is a Vegan and his mom

2698
02:26:04.481 --> 02:26:08.770
wears a leather jacket.
It's the most hilarious thing ever.
She's,
yeah,

2699
02:26:08.771 --> 02:26:11.420
she's not a Vegan.
She wants the kid to be a vegans.

2700
02:26:12.370 --> 02:26:14.130
<v 2>Is it true that my friends,</v>

2701
02:26:14.131 --> 02:26:19.131
I lactose intolerant and she recently told me that the Ibuprofen that she has to

2702
02:26:19.891 --> 02:26:21.330
take a lot.
Uh,

2703
02:26:21.331 --> 02:26:25.710
recently I put dairy inside of the Ibuprofen and she started getting really sick

2704
02:26:25.711 --> 02:26:30.711
from it and she found out that that some ibuprofens have dairy as a filler

2705
02:26:31.240 --> 02:26:33.460
<v 1>almost.
They use lactose,
the milk sugar,</v>

2706
02:26:33.520 --> 02:26:38.470
if you're lactose intolerant they'll mess you up.
Often uses lactose,
all of it.

2707
02:26:38.500 --> 02:26:41.550
It's just a pharmaceutical filler.
So when I say your sugar,

2708
02:26:41.551 --> 02:26:42.790
sometimes they use this milk sugar

2709
02:26:42.850 --> 02:26:45.550
<v 2>if fucked her up though for two weeks,
like really sick,</v>

2710
02:26:45.820 --> 02:26:47.530
couldn't get out of bed and it was just from that.

2711
02:26:48.130 --> 02:26:50.230
<v 1>Wow,
that's so weird man.</v>

2712
02:26:51.960 --> 02:26:55.480
It would think that that was something that they would absolutely not put in.

2713
02:26:55.481 --> 02:26:58.750
We know how many people are lactose intolerant.
Absolutely.
That's putting nuts.

2714
02:26:58.751 --> 02:27:02.110
Any medicine,
do you drink milk?
I don't drink milk.

2715
02:27:02.180 --> 02:27:06.910
I am allergic to milk because milk and gluten cross react with toxic molds that

2716
02:27:06.911 --> 02:27:08.920
you breathe.
So cross react.
How so?

2717
02:27:09.010 --> 02:27:12.940
Cross reactive means that there's a an eight amino acid sequence that's present

2718
02:27:12.941 --> 02:27:17.140
in caisson and in gluten and in certain species of toxic mold.

2719
02:27:17.141 --> 02:27:21.070
So if your immune system and the memory B cells get programmed to attack that

2720
02:27:21.071 --> 02:27:22.300
eight amino acid sequence,

2721
02:27:22.540 --> 02:27:26.500
you're going to see those foods as invaders and you're going to get a long,

2722
02:27:26.501 --> 02:27:28.990
low grade inflammatory response to them.
Wow.

2723
02:27:29.020 --> 02:27:33.310
And is this everybody or is this just people that are extra sensitive to it?

2724
02:27:33.340 --> 02:27:36.070
It depends on what you've been exposed to.
It depends on the species.

2725
02:27:36.071 --> 02:27:37.870
It depends on your genetic subtype,

2726
02:27:37.900 --> 02:27:41.380
but 28% of people are going to get that pretty darn unlikely and other people

2727
02:27:41.381 --> 02:27:42.190
can do.

2728
02:27:42.190 --> 02:27:46.270
We've got some are between like 50 and 100 million people in the u s alone with

2729
02:27:46.271 --> 02:27:49.810
autoimmune conditions today.
It's a pretty big problem.
And the question is,

2730
02:27:49.811 --> 02:27:53.890
is it like a problem with the gut biome or is it an external environmental
thing?

2731
02:27:54.130 --> 02:27:59.130
And I can tell you that when we look at the studies of people's immune systems

2732
02:27:59.321 --> 02:28:01.000
are attacking different parts of their bodies.

2733
02:28:01.240 --> 02:28:05.930
There's definitely a problem with these anti nutrients from foods and anti

2734
02:28:05.931 --> 02:28:09.390
nutrients from,
uh,
from uh,

2735
02:28:09.430 --> 02:28:11.530
molds and other toxins in the environment.

2736
02:28:11.860 --> 02:28:14.270
But let's talk more about this raw vegan thing,
right?

2737
02:28:14.380 --> 02:28:15.850
Because your question is what's lacking.

2738
02:28:16.930 --> 02:28:20.260
It's actually what's there that shouldn't be there.
That's a bigger problem.

2739
02:28:20.600 --> 02:28:22.100
And you remember the last time we talked about

2740
02:28:22.260 --> 02:28:25.580
<v 4>Sal Jassen?
Yeah.
So that's one of the many things,</v>

2741
02:28:25.581 --> 02:28:29.990
but there's a whole class of like you can counteract that with,
with calcium.

2742
02:28:29.991 --> 02:28:32.570
Calcium.
Yeah.
You just do the calcium loading thing that,

2743
02:28:32.600 --> 02:28:35.420
that I wrote about and just put it in the water or at least as cook it and drain

2744
02:28:35.421 --> 02:28:37.250
off the water and like you can,
you can account for it.

2745
02:28:37.251 --> 02:28:41.510
You just don't want it to crystallize in your blood.
When I was a raw Vegan,

2746
02:28:41.511 --> 02:28:44.810
I certainly was getting the joint pain and some of the things that came from

2747
02:28:44.811 --> 02:28:47.300
excess oxalic acid cause I was like going crazy on the rock,

2748
02:28:47.330 --> 02:28:50.420
like purple cabbage and Kale.
Like actually I really like that stuff.

2749
02:28:50.421 --> 02:28:53.690
But I did find it was having an effect on me.
And

2750
02:28:55.190 --> 02:28:56.860
there's a whole class of,

2751
02:28:56.880 --> 02:29:01.880
of these things called a glutenins and the broader categories called lectins and

2752
02:29:03.501 --> 02:29:06.110
elected is yet again,
I keep talking about these.

2753
02:29:06.140 --> 02:29:09.020
It's something used in nature as a defense system.

2754
02:29:09.320 --> 02:29:11.480
So our cells in our bodies use Lectin,

2755
02:29:11.481 --> 02:29:13.310
which is a protein that's attracted to a sugar.

2756
02:29:13.580 --> 02:29:16.010
It's one of the many ways our cells communicate with each other.

2757
02:29:16.310 --> 02:29:20.450
And it's particularly used for blood clotting and coagulation types of things.

2758
02:29:20.800 --> 02:29:25.610
Uh,
lots of different plants use lectins as part of their defense mechanism.

2759
02:29:25.940 --> 02:29:28.490
And you've heard of like [inaudible],
you know the,
the breaking bad,

2760
02:29:28.491 --> 02:29:32.780
that little thing that's Jack beans that you can extract that from Jack beans

2761
02:29:32.781 --> 02:29:36.470
and a super tiny,
tiny amount of that stuff is fatal.

2762
02:29:36.890 --> 02:29:39.710
And even when we want to look at like what blood type you are,

2763
02:29:39.740 --> 02:29:43.670
we take lectins that come from food,
things like beans,

2764
02:29:43.880 --> 02:29:45.800
and we put a drop of Lectin in your blood.

2765
02:29:45.801 --> 02:29:48.650
And if your blood coagulates from this Lectin,
your Typo,
if it,

2766
02:29:48.920 --> 02:29:51.940
if it coagulates from this Lectin,
you're type A,
that's actually the test is,

2767
02:29:51.941 --> 02:29:52.790
is using these things.

2768
02:29:53.450 --> 02:29:58.310
So you can deactivate a lot of lectins by cooking them,

2769
02:29:58.760 --> 02:29:59.593
but not all of them.

2770
02:29:59.900 --> 02:30:04.190
And you can also go through and you can rinse them out.

2771
02:30:04.191 --> 02:30:07.580
So like your grandmother,
likely if you ate beans,

2772
02:30:07.610 --> 02:30:10.250
knew that you soak the beans overnight,
your rent some multiple times.

2773
02:30:10.251 --> 02:30:14.540
You do all these steps and that helps.
You can reduce the Lectins,

2774
02:30:14.541 --> 02:30:18.330
but the lectins are still there and they enter your body and they wreak havoc
on,

2775
02:30:18.800 --> 02:30:21.770
on your immune system so they can penetrate the lining of the gut.

2776
02:30:21.800 --> 02:30:24.020
They actually opened up holes in your gut lining,

2777
02:30:24.021 --> 02:30:26.600
which leads to other proteins leaking through.

2778
02:30:27.050 --> 02:30:31.070
So when you go on a raw vegan diet with the purest of intent like I did,

2779
02:30:31.100 --> 02:30:32.870
I was looking at my own health.
I wanted to lose weight.

2780
02:30:32.871 --> 02:30:34.580
I felt great on it for about three months.

2781
02:30:34.940 --> 02:30:38.540
What you can do is you can increase your food sensitivities dramatically because

2782
02:30:38.541 --> 02:30:41.930
you end up cleaving holes in your gut based on the lectins you're eating,

2783
02:30:42.500 --> 02:30:43.100
and it's interesting.

2784
02:30:43.100 --> 02:30:47.270
Some foods are hiring lectins and others like the nightshade family,

2785
02:30:47.360 --> 02:30:51.320
potatoes,
eggplants,
tomatoes and bell peppers,

2786
02:30:51.710 --> 02:30:54.890
and there's actually 200 other members of the family like Goji Berries and

2787
02:30:54.891 --> 02:30:58.970
things.
People don't usually think about.
Those things are highest and Lectins,

2788
02:30:59.300 --> 02:31:02.180
so your body can detoxify a certain amount of lectins.

2789
02:31:02.420 --> 02:31:07.220
Some people are genetically sensitive to say potatoes or tomatoes.

2790
02:31:07.760 --> 02:31:12.760
20% of all rheumatoid arthritis is tied to that nightshade family I just talked

2791
02:31:12.861 --> 02:31:13.101
about,

2792
02:31:13.101 --> 02:31:16.130
so we could eliminate huge amounts of arthritis drugs if we just told people,

2793
02:31:16.131 --> 02:31:20.940
hey,
it might be that stuff.
Guess where the other big of Lectins is?
It's grains,

2794
02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:25.440
particularly wheat.
Wheat has a,
a Lectin,
I believe it's called Wga.

2795
02:31:25.500 --> 02:31:27.300
It also contains a glutinous.

2796
02:31:27.330 --> 02:31:30.030
This is the thing that I talked about earlier that causes clotting of your red

2797
02:31:30.031 --> 02:31:33.780
blood cells.
It cuts a hole in the lining of your gut.
Let's other crap through,

2798
02:31:34.020 --> 02:31:38.160
and then it causes your blood to clot.
So when you go on a Vegan Diet,

2799
02:31:38.161 --> 02:31:41.670
you have to eat a ton of vegetables just to get enough calories to function.

2800
02:31:41.730 --> 02:31:42.780
And when I was arriving,

2801
02:31:42.840 --> 02:31:46.590
I mean I had to buy new salad bowls like this big just so I could get enough

2802
02:31:46.591 --> 02:31:51.210
salad in me and I'd make like these like fatty dressings with like two Avocados

2803
02:31:51.211 --> 02:31:54.330
and like a ton of soaked cashews and sprouted this and I,
you know,

2804
02:31:54.420 --> 02:31:56.790
add some Bragg's amino acids and all this stuff.

2805
02:31:57.060 --> 02:32:00.480
And two hours later I'm having this ginormous lunch and I can like barely chew

2806
02:32:00.481 --> 02:32:03.960
it enough and my calories are still barely where they should be to keep me
going.

2807
02:32:04.110 --> 02:32:06.660
But okay,
I got a ton of nutrient density.

2808
02:32:06.930 --> 02:32:11.760
I also got a ton of anti nutrient density and those anti-nutrients wreak havoc

2809
02:32:11.940 --> 02:32:16.380
on my GI tract and on the other immune reactivity things that I had going on.

2810
02:32:16.410 --> 02:32:21.180
And I've seen this in other people who come to the blog,
they literally say,

2811
02:32:22.020 --> 02:32:25.950
wow,
like I'm recovering from this and I've had this happen to good friends.

2812
02:32:26.220 --> 02:32:30.210
In fact,
one of my guys is a black belt in Aikido.
One of my buddies from school,

2813
02:32:30.420 --> 02:32:33.450
he went on a raw vegan diet and it hit,
wrecked his health.

2814
02:32:33.451 --> 02:32:35.700
He's like one of the more sensitive one of the guys,

2815
02:32:35.810 --> 02:32:40.110
more sensitive to food than anyone else I've met.
Um,
it's kind of amazing,

2816
02:32:40.111 --> 02:32:43.290
but this is happening and this is not about what are you not getting from a Ravi

2817
02:32:43.291 --> 02:32:45.720
and die?
It's what are you getting that we should cook out of our food?

2818
02:32:45.840 --> 02:32:46.581
What do you get?
Yeah.

2819
02:32:46.581 --> 02:32:50.580
So a Vegan die wouldn't be nearly as bad to you as a raw vegan

2820
02:32:52.130 --> 02:32:55.920
and a vegetarian one is a bigger advantage because if you're going to be a

2821
02:32:55.921 --> 02:32:58.650
vegetarian,
you're probably not going to have that big of an issue with protein.

2822
02:32:58.700 --> 02:32:59.970
I'm a fan of moderate protein.

2823
02:32:59.971 --> 02:33:03.240
Unless you're lifting heavy or you're doing some sort of really intense
exercise,

2824
02:33:03.241 --> 02:33:06.390
you need more to replace what you damaged.
You know,
gorillas eat,
you know,

2825
02:33:06.391 --> 02:33:10.470
a ton of celery and stuff and they get reasonable amounts of of density here.

2826
02:33:10.590 --> 02:33:14.330
But what you're missing there on a vegan diet is the saturated fats,

2827
02:33:14.350 --> 02:33:18.480
the the butter.
You really need saturated fat for your brain,
for your hormones,

2828
02:33:18.481 --> 02:33:22.470
for your skin,
and coconut oil itself does not have butyric acid.

2829
02:33:22.471 --> 02:33:27.060
It doesn't have the fatty acid profile that butter does and butter.

2830
02:33:27.061 --> 02:33:29.490
If you're not going to eat animal fat is your next best source.

2831
02:33:29.970 --> 02:33:33.810
Egg yolks are amazing.
You need that cholesterol as a building block.

2832
02:33:33.840 --> 02:33:36.210
Every cell in your body has cholesterol.
You can't copy cells with,
okay,

2833
02:33:36.250 --> 02:33:38.960
<v 0>well it also doesn't make any sense if you don't need the eggs and it doesn't</v>

2834
02:33:38.961 --> 02:33:41.660
make any sense if you don't eat butter,
nobody has to die for eggs.

2835
02:33:41.661 --> 02:33:43.940
Nobody has to die for butter.
It's just that simple.

2836
02:33:43.941 --> 02:33:48.941
You fucks crazy silly bitches out there running away from eggs that can never be

2837
02:33:49.641 --> 02:33:53.720
chickens no matter what happens to them.
Those are eggs,
period.
That's it.

2838
02:33:53.900 --> 02:33:56.090
It's free food from a chicken free food.

2839
02:33:56.150 --> 02:33:56.610
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

2840
02:33:56.610 --> 02:34:01.610
It's one of the more useful ways of converting nonfood proteins.

2841
02:34:02.480 --> 02:34:05.960
Like you can feed scraps to a chicken and they convert it to fool.

2842
02:34:06.080 --> 02:34:09.830
Mother Nature is cool too because even if you feed kind of moldy stuff to a

2843
02:34:09.831 --> 02:34:11.840
chicken,
like lower quality,
spoiled food,

2844
02:34:12.680 --> 02:34:16.430
we're programmed to keep as much at just all animals are our program.

2845
02:34:16.431 --> 02:34:20.350
That way to keep as toxin the way from the the baby or the fetus or the embryo

2846
02:34:20.351 --> 02:34:23.590
as possible.
So most of the toxins don't go through into the egg.

2847
02:34:23.591 --> 02:34:25.330
Some of them can,
particularly metals,

2848
02:34:25.600 --> 02:34:30.600
but the organic toxins and anti nutrients get filtered out by the mom chicken,

2849
02:34:30.640 --> 02:34:31.960
so the eggs are relatively pure.

2850
02:34:31.961 --> 02:34:34.660
Even that crappy industrial eggs that do have some contamination,

2851
02:34:34.661 --> 02:34:35.680
they have arsenic and things,

2852
02:34:35.920 --> 02:34:38.770
but there are a better choice than a lot of foods because of that filtering

2853
02:34:38.771 --> 02:34:43.030
process that happens in the hen.
I have 14 chickens now.
Oh,
you rock.
Yeah,

2854
02:34:43.031 --> 02:34:46.270
I'm jealous.
A new thing that we started doing this year

2855
02:34:46.470 --> 02:34:50.820
<v 0>and every day I get between eight and 12 eggs.</v>

2856
02:34:51.260 --> 02:34:52.870
Are they all in cages or do you let them know?

2857
02:34:53.460 --> 02:34:55.590
I have a whole huge yard where they wander around.

2858
02:34:55.710 --> 02:34:57.480
There's a coop where they go in at night,

2859
02:34:57.510 --> 02:35:00.540
but during the day we opened the door and they just walk out and he'd leave the

2860
02:35:00.541 --> 02:35:02.280
door open at night.
They walk back in.

2861
02:35:02.420 --> 02:35:05.720
<v 4>Do they do in the morning?
No,
that it's only roosters.</v>

2862
02:35:06.020 --> 02:35:08.870
Roosters are the dumbest,
actually.
They're kind of smart,

2863
02:35:08.871 --> 02:35:10.250
but they're just so stubborn.

2864
02:35:10.630 --> 02:35:14.510
I had a rooster that would sleeping outside my bedroom window.
It just,

2865
02:35:14.540 --> 02:35:18.600
you've just moved in and a every night,
wasn't your rooster now?

2866
02:35:18.620 --> 02:35:21.390
I used to live out in the country and,
and he just showed up and,
and I,

2867
02:35:21.500 --> 02:35:24.500
I was like,
I can't handle this.
So I literally,
I woke up at five in the morning.

2868
02:35:24.501 --> 02:35:25.700
I was all discombobulated.

2869
02:35:25.940 --> 02:35:30.370
I'm running around like knock him out of the tree and then the next night he's,

2870
02:35:30.500 --> 02:35:33.350
he's back like they roost on a branch.
So let you shoot him.
Well,

2871
02:35:33.351 --> 02:35:38.300
I got my BB gun out and shoot him with one pump,
just enough to knock him off.

2872
02:35:38.301 --> 02:35:41.330
Not enough to damage him.
It took three months.
Every night I'd like,

2873
02:35:41.331 --> 02:35:43.790
brushed my teeth,
shoot the chicken and go to sleep.

2874
02:35:44.990 --> 02:35:46.370
And not three months before he'd move.

2875
02:35:46.371 --> 02:35:48.590
I sought off the branch he was sitting on while he was on it.

2876
02:35:48.860 --> 02:35:51.710
He just moved up on graph three months and kept doing that and he finally

2877
02:35:51.711 --> 02:35:53.360
learned.
But yeah,
that's hilarious.

2878
02:35:53.420 --> 02:35:57.040
I would have been eaten that chicken on day two.
Uh,
his name was Ed Hannibal.

2879
02:35:57.520 --> 02:35:59.630
I put it named them.
I put a chicken breast,

2880
02:35:59.660 --> 02:36:01.400
like a spoiled one out for the barn cats.

2881
02:36:01.401 --> 02:36:03.560
And he chased off the barn cats and ate a chicken breast.

2882
02:36:03.710 --> 02:36:06.110
And like that's the most disgusting thing ever.
That's why his name was Hannibal.

2883
02:36:06.111 --> 02:36:10.520
I'm not eating that chicken.
He's,
that's hilarious.
He chased off a cat.
Two cats.

2884
02:36:10.760 --> 02:36:15.530
He was a big tough bird.
Yeah.
Those,
those real big fighting roosters.

2885
02:36:15.560 --> 02:36:19.310
He was like a manly rooster.
Yeah.
My old gardener,
he fights roosters.

2886
02:36:19.550 --> 02:36:23.510
I went to his house that he's got a,
uh,
there's,
there's areas in the valley.

2887
02:36:23.511 --> 02:36:27.070
We swear to God,
you're in Mexico.
There's not a fucking single sign.
Right.

2888
02:36:27.070 --> 02:36:27.160
And it's

2889
02:36:27.160 --> 02:36:29.440
<v 0>in English.
And he took me to his,
uh,</v>

2890
02:36:29.441 --> 02:36:34.370
his buddy had a house that in the back of the house they had like,
I dunno,

2891
02:36:34.420 --> 02:36:39.130
mad it at least a hundred cages were chickens were in,
it was nuts.

2892
02:36:39.160 --> 02:36:43.450
One day,
uh,
had this barbecue pit and they would roast a goat and a,

2893
02:36:43.451 --> 02:36:46.690
they'd kill a goat.
They butchered their own animals.
This isn't like the valley.

2894
02:36:47.020 --> 02:36:50.150
They butcher totally illegal.
Butch of their own.
I mean,
it's not,

2895
02:36:50.360 --> 02:36:53.080
isn't none of it's sanitary conditions.
Butcher a goat,

2896
02:36:53.110 --> 02:36:56.110
cook it over a fire and then behind that they would have chicken fights.

2897
02:36:56.350 --> 02:37:00.250
It all bet on it.
Wow.
Yeah.
These fuckers are big man.

2898
02:37:00.370 --> 02:37:02.830
They're big and mean.
And they put razor blades on.

2899
02:37:03.400 --> 02:37:06.520
I didn't watch the actual chicken fights.
I watched them training chickens.

2900
02:37:06.820 --> 02:37:11.470
I didn't watch them actually a slice each other up.
But it was a,
it's weird.

2901
02:37:11.500 --> 02:37:13.540
I don't,
I'm not a fan of the,

2902
02:37:13.541 --> 02:37:18.200
the whole idea of getting these animals to do things like fight for money and

2903
02:37:18.201 --> 02:37:21.800
slice them up with razors and stuff like that.
It seems kind of fucked up.

2904
02:37:21.830 --> 02:37:24.480
But they say that they do it and then they cook them in,

2905
02:37:24.530 --> 02:37:28.790
eat them like this is just like something they do.
That also is fun as well,

2906
02:37:28.791 --> 02:37:29.650
you know,
as a

2907
02:37:29.920 --> 02:37:32.980
<v 1>food.
But my,
my understanding of food is,</v>

2908
02:37:33.000 --> 02:37:35.980
is you didn't want to eat an animal that died in distress.

2909
02:37:36.160 --> 02:37:37.330
They get all these stress hormones.

2910
02:37:37.331 --> 02:37:40.750
It affects the quality of the meat and it affects a lot.

2911
02:37:40.840 --> 02:37:45.490
So I would prefer to eat animals that were raised well and killed ethically

2912
02:37:46.280 --> 02:37:49.990
without knowing it's coming.
Yeah.
They liked watching chickens fight though.

2913
02:37:50.050 --> 02:37:51.070
I think that's what it's about.

2914
02:37:51.071 --> 02:37:54.050
A lot of it is they're betting on these chickens fighting too.
It's,

2915
02:37:54.060 --> 02:37:56.410
it's a cultural thing.
Yeah.
I,

2916
02:37:57.220 --> 02:38:00.790
I've seen enough from Hannibal that that was a smarter rooster then I would have

2917
02:38:00.791 --> 02:38:04.510
thought like he,
he knew that the BB gun was doing it to him.
He didn't know how,

2918
02:38:04.511 --> 02:38:07.930
but he'd like hide in ditches and like threw little chicken commando things and,

2919
02:38:08.110 --> 02:38:08.560
and I,

2920
02:38:08.560 --> 02:38:11.500
I actually gained an appreciation for the intelligence of a rooster from having

2921
02:38:11.501 --> 02:38:12.940
this,
this thing.
It was funny,
you know,

2922
02:38:12.960 --> 02:38:15.880
to watching one rooster intimidate to cats,
walk up,

2923
02:38:15.910 --> 02:38:18.340
eat their food right in front of them,
stare him down and then just walk.

2924
02:38:19.260 --> 02:38:23.260
It was amazing just to watch these interactions.
So I mean I,
I'm with the,

2925
02:38:24.100 --> 02:38:26.650
the,
the way of thinking about when you kill an animal,

2926
02:38:26.770 --> 02:38:30.670
how many deaths does it take to feed someone and give me the beef gimme me the

2927
02:38:30.671 --> 02:38:33.610
lamb,
because that land is going to feed me for a month for one death.

2928
02:38:33.640 --> 02:38:34.510
You kill him,
the chickens,

2929
02:38:34.511 --> 02:38:37.360
it's good for like half a meal and you're still hungry and you got really not so

2930
02:38:37.361 --> 02:38:41.350
good fat out of it anyway.
Chicken fat's not good.
That's most of the Omega six.

2931
02:38:41.351 --> 02:38:43.090
Even if you feed it like all the natural stuff,

2932
02:38:43.091 --> 02:38:47.110
like worms and coconuts and stuff.
So even if you are someone who eats meat,

2933
02:38:47.140 --> 02:38:50.170
he shouldn't just eat chicken.
I'd think it's actually bad for you.

2934
02:38:50.171 --> 02:38:54.970
It's the least compatible protein ratio with us compared to the red meat.

2935
02:38:55.360 --> 02:38:57.970
You can get a little too much iron if you only like tons of red meat.

2936
02:38:57.971 --> 02:39:02.840
But we have eggs for that.
So when I,
I kind of look at the whole,
you know,
what,

2937
02:39:03.100 --> 02:39:05.170
what's best for us?
Okay,
you kill an animal,

2938
02:39:05.171 --> 02:39:09.220
you can eat maybe half of the chicken,
the kills if he's maybe two people.

2939
02:39:09.430 --> 02:39:12.430
The chicken skin is full of Omega six fats that oxidized when you cook it.

2940
02:39:12.431 --> 02:39:14.020
So it's going to be inflammatory when you eat it.

2941
02:39:14.170 --> 02:39:16.840
So you want to take that skin off and you got to do something with the skin.

2942
02:39:16.870 --> 02:39:18.790
What are you going to do with it?
If you have pigs,

2943
02:39:18.791 --> 02:39:20.690
you would feed the skin to the pig with all the other scraps.

2944
02:39:20.691 --> 02:39:22.630
At least you get bacon out of it.
But most people,

2945
02:39:22.660 --> 02:39:25.450
they just throw away the chicken skin or they eat it.
It's to taste delicious.

2946
02:39:25.810 --> 02:39:28.480
It's delicious,
but it's the speed gives bacon tastes.

2947
02:39:28.580 --> 02:39:30.980
<v 0>That's true.
But sometimes this is what you want.</v>

2948
02:39:31.010 --> 02:39:33.920
Sometimes you actually want chickens.
Can I give you that?
Yeah.

2949
02:39:35.000 --> 02:39:38.060
If you ever seen those,
uh,
those,
uh,

2950
02:39:38.090 --> 02:39:42.830
videos on cro intelligence,
will they show how intelligent crows are?
No.

2951
02:39:43.040 --> 02:39:46.850
Oh my God.
Crows are so intelligent that they're almost like,

2952
02:39:47.060 --> 02:39:50.480
they're probably more intelligent than chimps.
It sounds crazy.

2953
02:39:50.481 --> 02:39:54.440
But there's a video of crows use of tools.
Let's end with this.
Brian.
Show the SH.

2954
02:39:54.500 --> 02:39:58.340
Pull this video.
Crows use tools.
Watch those.
That's a cool video.

2955
02:39:58.910 --> 02:40:03.630
This is a fascinating Fazio Cro using t.
There's a,

2956
02:40:03.660 --> 02:40:06.920
there's quite a,
quite a series of different ones,

2957
02:40:07.310 --> 02:40:10.850
but crazy using three tools in a row.
Yeah.

2958
02:40:12.710 --> 02:40:13.710
Give some volume.

2959
02:40:15.810 --> 02:40:18.120
Just doesn't look like it had the crow.
Yeah,

2960
02:40:18.130 --> 02:40:23.130
it's a tool and figures out that they can go and stick the tool and to these

2961
02:40:23.830 --> 02:40:28.500
little tubes and get things.
Whoa.
And then once he does that,

2962
02:40:28.501 --> 02:40:29.630
he gets a toothpick a,

2963
02:40:29.700 --> 02:40:33.640
he sticks at one tool in and he uses that one tool to get a different tool.

2964
02:40:36.240 --> 02:40:41.240
So she's cooking and he's fishing another tool c and he gets a longer tool with

2965
02:40:42.061 --> 02:40:46.350
each tool.
He gets a longer tool.
And then here he goes.

2966
02:40:47.430 --> 02:40:51.030
I had no idea.
Yeah.
So Craig,
and this is quickly,

2967
02:40:51.150 --> 02:40:54.120
this crow figured this all out within a couple of minutes and then he gets the

2968
02:40:54.121 --> 02:40:58.590
food.
See?
So he used a small tool to get the medium tool,

2969
02:40:58.591 --> 02:41:02.190
the medium tool to get the large tool,
the large tool to get the food.
I mean,

2970
02:41:02.340 --> 02:41:05.940
get the fuck out of dodge,
dude.
That's a smart ass animal.

2971
02:41:06.150 --> 02:41:07.440
They are smart as shit.

2972
02:41:08.290 --> 02:41:11.640
<v 1>You also don't taste good.
That'd be eating frozen.
No,</v>

2973
02:41:11.641 --> 02:41:15.000
but it's well known that you had to say they make you eat crow.
It's what you,

2974
02:41:15.030 --> 02:41:18.610
when you're about to die.
Oh,
that's funny.
Yeah.
That's why the cro means,
oh,

2975
02:41:18.630 --> 02:41:19.980
that I never even thought of that.

2976
02:41:20.010 --> 02:41:22.740
It's like the is like when when you're in the desert and there's like nothing

2977
02:41:22.741 --> 02:41:25.290
around,
you'd shoot a crow.
It's like I was going to starve.

2978
02:41:25.291 --> 02:41:28.040
So I hate the cro because apparently it tastes really crappy.
He's got a buyer.

2979
02:41:28.080 --> 02:41:31.260
I would feel bad eating an animal this smart,
and it was just like half a meal.

2980
02:41:31.290 --> 02:41:33.420
Crows aren't even that media,
but like I,
you know,

2981
02:41:33.550 --> 02:41:35.700
I don't feel so bad about a cow.
In fact,

2982
02:41:35.701 --> 02:41:38.910
the next Calli I'm actually going to slaughter it and butcher and myself with

2983
02:41:38.911 --> 02:41:40.020
the butcher.
Yeah.
I want to,

2984
02:41:40.021 --> 02:41:42.260
I also believe that if I'm going to believe it's ethical,

2985
02:41:42.400 --> 02:41:43.380
I just be willing to kill it.

2986
02:41:43.830 --> 02:41:47.400
So I'm going to do it and I'm going to do it in a peaceful way and I'm going to

2987
02:41:47.520 --> 02:41:51.840
enjoy every last bite.
What about game animal?
Do you,
do you eat moose or elk?

2988
02:41:52.350 --> 02:41:53.980
Love the stones.
It's good for you.
Um,

2989
02:41:54.060 --> 02:41:56.970
I've gone deer hunting a few times with my father in law on Pemberton.

2990
02:41:56.971 --> 02:42:01.230
He's got this amazing like access to this like crown land that's no one ever

2991
02:42:01.231 --> 02:42:02.020
goes to.

2992
02:42:02.020 --> 02:42:05.970
Last time I was there I had 17 dear in my sites and not one of them was a buck.

2993
02:42:05.990 --> 02:42:07.890
I like,
it's so frustrating.
I'm like,
for God's sake,

2994
02:42:08.240 --> 02:42:11.990
<v 0>17 dear.
And all of them were girls.
You didn't have a tag for it?</v>

2995
02:42:12.350 --> 02:42:14.660
<v 1>No.
Oh yeah.</v>

2996
02:42:14.661 --> 02:42:19.490
He's Crozer fucking genius that you just took that long stick and took a and got

2997
02:42:19.491 --> 02:42:23.570
a second stick with it.
Yeah.
And then yeah,
I'm going to got meet.
Wow.
Yeah.

2998
02:42:23.720 --> 02:42:27.530
There's about 20 crows that live in my backyard and they freak me out.

2999
02:42:27.531 --> 02:42:30.350
Sometimes I'll go out there and they'll just start off screaming at me.
Oh yeah,

3000
02:42:30.351 --> 02:42:33.930
they're talking,
well they're there going,
Oh God,
this dickheads hear it.

3001
02:42:33.931 --> 02:42:36.860
My dog is so small that I think sometimes that,
I don't know,

3002
02:42:36.861 --> 02:42:40.490
crows might fuck with it or say they always just seem very violent when I come

3003
02:42:40.491 --> 02:42:41.990
outside of Rockwood.
Yeah.

3004
02:42:41.991 --> 02:42:44.540
Or magpies will totally just torture it out to that machine.

3005
02:42:44.541 --> 02:42:46.460
And Magpie Necro they're like black and white.

3006
02:42:46.490 --> 02:42:50.480
They make a different sound and there's like a creepy children of the corn thing

3007
02:42:50.481 --> 02:42:54.080
with magpies cause they're like in bigger flocks.
And when I was a teenager,

3008
02:42:54.980 --> 02:42:56.180
I lived out in the country and,

3009
02:42:56.270 --> 02:42:59.000
and these magpies are decided to like nest in this tree and they were like

3010
02:42:59.001 --> 02:43:03.590
covering my car in,
in Shit,
like,
like hundreds of spots in one night.

3011
02:43:03.860 --> 02:43:07.400
And I had this idea that if I like shot one in the tree,

3012
02:43:07.401 --> 02:43:09.590
they'd like get the message that like go through somewhere else,

3013
02:43:09.710 --> 02:43:12.820
which is actually a bad idea.
Like,
like shouldn't have done that.
Um,

3014
02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:17.200
so I shot one and I winged it.
It was just what the 22.
Um,
and so I was like,

3015
02:43:17.201 --> 02:43:18.670
I got to go finish this thing off.
Like it's,

3016
02:43:18.671 --> 02:43:23.050
I would never leave an animal suffering like that.
So all of these birds like,

3017
02:43:23.051 --> 02:43:26.320
like suddenly got like quiet and they all started like yelling and like making

3018
02:43:26.321 --> 02:43:31.240
like all this like just angry sounds and it was really kind of creepy and I went

3019
02:43:31.241 --> 02:43:33.400
and I found the bird,
it was in the running away and I,

3020
02:43:33.401 --> 02:43:36.430
I put it out of its misery and I felt like kind of guilty after that.

3021
02:43:36.700 --> 02:43:39.220
Not that I haven't,
you know,
shot to burden eaten it or something,

3022
02:43:39.221 --> 02:43:42.430
but it was just like I was just killing it to like stop shitting on my car.

3023
02:43:42.610 --> 02:43:44.050
But just the,
the amount of like,

3024
02:43:44.170 --> 02:43:47.460
just like anger and silence and just weird behavior from all the other birds
was,

3025
02:43:47.490 --> 02:43:48.880
it kind of creeped me out.
It was weird.

3026
02:43:49.450 --> 02:43:51.670
<v 0>You should take the dead one,
hang up by his ankles,</v>

3027
02:43:52.090 --> 02:43:56.470
hang him from a tree with a picture of a human finger on it.
Like this.

3028
02:43:56.570 --> 02:43:59.230
I figured out stupid.
I wouldn't do that today.
Shit in my car.

3029
02:43:59.231 --> 02:44:03.190
He fucks exactly that.
That was a,
that was the,
when we have guns,
we have cities,

3030
02:44:03.191 --> 02:44:03.970
we have cars.

3031
02:44:03.970 --> 02:44:05.320
<v 1>Not the most conscious thing I've ever done.</v>

3032
02:44:05.670 --> 02:44:09.070
Once I get a face either if you're a dangerous person,
there's been studies.

3033
02:44:09.160 --> 02:44:10.420
Oh Wow.
Okay.
Yeah,

3034
02:44:10.421 --> 02:44:13.630
so those magpies so we could put like my face on the scarecrow and they would

3035
02:44:13.631 --> 02:44:14.570
run away.
All

3036
02:44:14.620 --> 02:44:16.790
<v 0>right to find Dave Asprey on Twitter.</v>

3037
02:44:16.791 --> 02:44:21.791
He is a bulletproof exec on Twitter and the website is a bulletproof exec.com or

3038
02:44:23.811 --> 02:44:24.890
bulletproof executive,

3039
02:44:25.040 --> 02:44:29.420
exact.com bulletproof exec.com and you got a lot of shit on that website.

3040
02:44:29.421 --> 02:44:30.950
Really fascinating website.

3041
02:44:31.280 --> 02:44:33.800
You could get lost on that website for a long ass time.

3042
02:44:34.460 --> 02:44:37.130
How long did you spend building that website?
I don't know how many hours,

3043
02:44:37.131 --> 02:44:41.260
but it's been about three years.
Yeah.

3045
02:44:45.920 --> 02:44:49.310
That's what's bizarre.
You,
you come in here and just spew all this out,

3046
02:44:49.311 --> 02:44:53.480
like you're giving some sort of a college lecture on Mycotoxins and it's off the

3047
02:44:53.481 --> 02:44:56.210
top of your head.
Dude.
It's very impressive stuff.
