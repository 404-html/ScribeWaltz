00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.500
We're live.
We're live.
Jesus Christ,
man.
I'm tweeting Ustream.
Dot.

00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:11.970
TV Ford Slash J o.
E r o g.

3
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.240
A n.
Boom tweet,
uh,

4
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.890
fresh from making big foot his bitch.
Ladies and gentlemen,

5
00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.050
Les Stroud.
What's up buddy at Joseph foots fun scene and I,
man,

6
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.620
I know,
I'm like,
he just got off stage at the comedy store,

7
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.880
which I couldn't believe you were there and I was here.
Oh perfect.
So I was like,

8
00:00:32.881 --> 00:00:36.080
yeah,
there's David spade.
Amy Schuler.
It's like Stella.

9
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.380
And then you get totally brought your engineers.

10
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.070
What was like what it are these guys like sleeping?
No,

11
00:00:41.071 --> 00:00:44.820
Brian was getting into the studio store to Brian was at the store and Jamie,

12
00:00:44.821 --> 00:00:48.420
I told him today that you were going to come by.
I alerted him this afternoon.

13
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.580
We had worked out accommodations and here we are.
He got energy,
man.

14
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.500
I,
while you're flying them all morning to write,
I do what I like to do.

15
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.770
If you do what you like to do,
you got an energy.
I know.
And both my,

16
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.950
like my camera man and my field producer,
they're completely,

17
00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:07.680
my bitch is not because they're not here and they're like the biggest fan of
you.

18
00:01:07.681 --> 00:01:11.160
And I'm like,
so,
so you're gone go out to bed and there they've got a bad,

19
00:01:11.161 --> 00:01:14.180
now they're going to bed at the Sheridan.
It's like,
okay,
well your pussy,

20
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.580
so I'm gonna,
I'm gonna go hang with y'all.
Sleep is for the week sometimes.

21
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.420
Sometimes good.
It's good idea to get sleep.
It's a renewable resource.

22
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.390
That's what you got to recognize and if you have an opportunity to do some shit

23
00:01:24.391 --> 00:01:28.560
that you probably couldn't do,
except if you stayed awake,
you got to stay away.

24
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.930
If you don't stay away,
you're not willing to suffer.

25
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.230
You can suffer a little if you can't pull an all nighter,

26
00:01:34.231 --> 00:01:36.840
you don't get all nighter memories.
That's right.
That's right.

27
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.410
I got some all night or memories from when I was in high school.
Van Sleeping,

28
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.780
sleeping meant when you know,

29
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.550
I know I'm getting freaking older and I'm still like,
okay,
I want to sleep less.

30
00:01:47.551 --> 00:01:50.080
Actually you do sleep less when you get older at the top.

31
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.490
Testosterone is not flowing as much and you can't do that like sleep until noon,

32
00:01:53.491 --> 00:01:55.290
shit anymore.
You can't do that as you get older,

33
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.700
which in the end is a cool thing because you can hang out longer.

34
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.740
You're just older,
you can,

35
00:02:01.741 --> 00:02:03.750
but you can also get up at eight o'clock in the morning,

36
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.860
jerk off and go right back to sleep.
That works too.
That does work.
10 sleep,

37
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.710
you just got to,
got to fucking make sure you schedule it.

38
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.940
You got to wait as long as you wait so long as you wake up hard,

39
00:02:14.941 --> 00:02:17.520
then you know you're still alive.
Not So,
not necessarily.

40
00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:21.800
It might mean just have to pick.
He boners the best.
That's Deon.

41
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.970
Deon are useless.
They barely feel them.
Who's Dick is this?

42
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.570
You can't really use them actually either.
Ken,
Ken,
but you can't use,

43
00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.030
it's not the same though.

44
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.510
They come doesn't want to come through the piece and you say lasts longer I yes,

45
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.610
exactly.
It's,
you're like this,
this fuck.

46
00:02:38.611 --> 00:02:41.870
We started at the bottom on this interview,
so we're drinking.

47
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.180
We just got back from the comedy store.
It's one o'clock in the,

48
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.900
it's almost one 1230 in the morning.

49
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.320
It's late last time with you it was like 10:00 AM but it was all dark inside and

50
00:02:52.351 --> 00:02:53.131
we only had it.

51
00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:57.120
We had a beer and what's it only 10:00 AM 10:00 AM in the morning when we were

52
00:02:57.121 --> 00:03:00.220
doing,
but this is the way more realistic.
This is better.
Yeah.
This is,

53
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.290
well I like doing different times.

54
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.240
I think there's good doom during the day sometimes,

55
00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:05.800
but it's also good to do it at night sometimes.

56
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.090
Especially like we've never done it like live like leaving the comedy store and

57
00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:12.490
come in here,
but that's,
it's a move to do.

58
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.090
I mean once the first we own this joint,
we just come in anytime you want.

59
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.330
Why not?
It's like,
it's like cutting an album man.

60
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.550
Neil young used to only do everything after midnight.

61
00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.220
He probably did a naked too probably,
you know back then before TMZ you probably,

62
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.910
everybody's on acid just recorded stuff that sucks.
Throw it away.

63
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.920
I just don't want to picture Neil young naked at this moment.
Just open up.

64
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.680
They usually have strippers recording studios late at night.
Yeah.

65
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.450
It's not just all dudes.
So where are they now?
You don't want to answer.

66
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.300
They fuck up the dynamic.
That's a good set tonight.
Thanks.
That was awesome.

67
00:03:49.301 --> 00:03:51.250
I was telling,
I was telling Joe I was,

68
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.250
I was texting him at one point cause I was listening to,

69
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.290
I was listening on comedy central cause I'm just addicted to standup comedy.

70
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.380
So tonight for me was awesome.
This will just go in and see all those,

71
00:03:59.381 --> 00:04:03.270
all those great comedians.
And I texted him and I,
and I realized,

72
00:04:03.271 --> 00:04:05.830
you know how like some comedians have like a Shtick,
right?

73
00:04:05.831 --> 00:04:09.250
Like the most obvious was like Jeff Foxworthy with as he might be a redneck

74
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:10.800
stuff and and all that.

75
00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.340
And with Joe you were nailing into this stuff and I,
and I was listening to,

76
00:04:15.341 --> 00:04:18.100
so he's got a riff thing that he does.

77
00:04:18.101 --> 00:04:22.870
There are analogies as called it and I start calling the rogue analogy cause

78
00:04:22.871 --> 00:04:24.210
it's like,
it's like,
it's like,

79
00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.580
well you know like when you get up in the morning and he got to say,
it's like,

80
00:04:27.581 --> 00:04:27.680
well,

81
00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.010
like an elephant giving you a blow job through a straw and you shouldn't go.

82
00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.160
Like,
actually that is kind of like an elephant.
Can you blow job here?

83
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.290
I didn't have a joke about it.
No,

84
00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.770
this is bad paraphrase and Liz gentleman from a drunk man dare you.
How dare you.

85
00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.790
But you got the analogy down.
You do that.
I'm not,

86
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.570
I'm not doing like the Joan Rivers blow smoke up your ass.
It's like,
Shit,

87
00:04:49.571 --> 00:04:53.230
you got that down and you,
I mean,
because I'm a standup comedian,

88
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.630
just I love it because I suck at it.

89
00:04:55.631 --> 00:04:57.160
I could never do it scares the crap out of me.

90
00:04:57.161 --> 00:04:58.540
I couldn't tell a joke to save myself.

91
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:01.410
But listening to you to do that and listen to you go into those analogies and

92
00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.930
it's like,
I'm going,
Oh shit man.
That's right.
That is like that.

93
00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:06.160
And it is like an elephant.

94
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.160
I think pretty much anybody's ever made.
Anybody laugh can do stand up.

95
00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.840
It's just a matter of do you want to do it?

96
00:05:13.841 --> 00:05:16.480
If you wanted to do it took a long fucking time,

97
00:05:16.481 --> 00:05:18.820
but we all know guys who sucked at it in the beginning,

98
00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:21.100
but they were just such fans of comedy.

99
00:05:21.101 --> 00:05:24.490
They just kept chipping away until eventually they figured it out and now

100
00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:26.800
they're like legit standups.
It just,
it happens.

101
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:29.350
I figured that you're 15 minutes out there.

102
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:32.110
I just did 90 minutes fats in La and Vegas from my,

103
00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.530
with my music when my concert.
Right and I did these concerts and it was great.

104
00:05:35.531 --> 00:05:36.011
We kicked ass.

105
00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:41.011
I figure my 90 minutes is barely as tough as your 15 minutes and says my friend.

106
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:42.880
It's just different man.

107
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.410
If you put the kind of time that you've put to searching for bigfoot and writing

108
00:05:47.411 --> 00:05:52.330
music into standup comedy,
you'd be really good at it.
Yeah,
but I'm not going to,

109
00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.010
I'm not going to cut,
dude.

110
00:05:54.011 --> 00:05:56.500
How many mistake foot shows are you going to do before you catch this

111
00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:00.840
motherfucker?
Yeah.
I need to know you don't already have them in the cage.

112
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:05.680
And My base,
he told me,
come on man,
I'll tell you,
it's,
it's really,
it's uh,

113
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:08.600
it's uh,
really,
um,
man,
it's,

114
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.310
it's a bizarre thing to be part of all of that and what's going on and,

115
00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.310
and how I ended up in this position was because there's so much bullshit in the

116
00:06:16.311 --> 00:06:19.520
field.
Like there's the nonsense that gets put out with,
you know,

117
00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:24.260
you got to show where you're trying to find big foot and you've got to crank out

118
00:06:24.261 --> 00:06:25.220
13 episodes.

119
00:06:25.221 --> 00:06:28.550
So you need to invent these crazy stories and silly stories and stupid stories

120
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:33.350
and nothing much is going on.
And I nothing,
nothing,
nothing,
nothing.

121
00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:36.770
And I come along and I'm like,
okay,
you let,
you know what?

122
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:38.690
I'll just talk to these guys.

123
00:06:38.691 --> 00:06:43.040
These dudes are into big foot and you say he's there,
you got him in a field,

124
00:06:43.041 --> 00:06:45.740
you're doing it.
Okay,
take me there and I'll tell you what,

125
00:06:45.741 --> 00:06:48.380
lead me there in the field overnight.
Oh,
let's just see what the happens.

126
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.970
And so I approach it.
I did six shows this year.
First one premiered last night.

127
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.850
We were talking about this before the show aired,
but I bears repeating.

128
00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.530
You might have invented the selfie.
Yeah,
yeah,
I know.
I know that.

129
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:02.570
I was underneath the Van Guard of,

130
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.840
it's very borderline because you did a lot of shows where it was just you all

131
00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:12.080
alone in the woods with a camera pointed at yourself and you,

132
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.460
you had the lens.
You know,

133
00:07:13.461 --> 00:07:16.580
like if you look at those little video cameras that less used,

134
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:20.660
you know they have that viewer that you could look at you or you could turn the

135
00:07:20.661 --> 00:07:22.360
camera towards you and flip this view around.

136
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:25.040
He could see what you're filming when you're filming yourself,

137
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.480
which is like a selfie.
So you might've been video selfie.

138
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.890
Nobody was doing it first guy.
Nobody were the first selfie guy.
The thing I,

139
00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:34.580
the thing I did with nobody else was doing was I put it on television,

140
00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:38.030
international broadcast TV.
That's the whole thing.
It's one thing to do it.

141
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:42.320
It's another thing to base a whole freaking show on it.
Way Worse than that.

142
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:45.680
You did it by yourself in the fucking woods.

143
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:50.900
You did it in Africa.
You did in the jungle.
You did it in the swamps.

144
00:07:50.901 --> 00:07:52.370
You did it in the desert.

145
00:07:52.610 --> 00:07:57.610
Just you not like that fucking English guy sleeping in hotel.

146
00:07:58.131 --> 00:07:59.630
We don't even say his name on this show.

147
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:04.340
Good that English fuck sleeping pretending to fall down ice slides.

148
00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:08.510
Johnny Appleseed,
that guy that Johnny Appleseed.
Fuck.
Oh man,

149
00:08:08.511 --> 00:08:11.690
I could go so far and that me that's you're right.

150
00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:13.370
Cause it gives credibility to shit.

151
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.500
That guy only exists because you weren't willing to fake shit.
That's right.

152
00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:20.090
You weren't willing to fix shit.

153
00:08:20.091 --> 00:08:22.190
The producers wanting to fake shit and they said,
okay,

154
00:08:22.191 --> 00:08:24.740
we'll get Johnny Appleseed to fake some shit.
Yeah,
that's,

155
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:30.150
I am swinging from vine to vine looking for steaks.

156
00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.740
Bitch,
you ain't any snakes.
You're gonna eat filet Mignon.

157
00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:37.040
You own at the four seasons.
You fucked as a van waiting to pick you up.

158
00:08:37.041 --> 00:08:41.560
It's air condition.
You've got off all over you.
You sleeping in fine linen,

159
00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:45.490
fine linen and was luck.
It was very pretty though.
It's very pretty.

160
00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.870
Still very pretty.
You're beautiful character.

161
00:08:47.871 --> 00:08:51.800
You've got a different kind of pretty going on.
Yeah,
it was.
It was,
it was,
it was,

162
00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:55.320
it was messed up.
It was,
you know,
I got,
I got asked over long time and I,

163
00:08:55.321 --> 00:08:57.750
like I said,
I'll never put it down on the networks.

164
00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:59.700
I'm still good with the networks and networks are great.

165
00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.030
Didn't I was coming down to my day.

166
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:06.060
I care about that all it comes down to one person.
It's all,
it's one person.

167
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:08.910
All right.
It's one,
it's one ice that that's just like,
oh,

168
00:09:08.911 --> 00:09:11.550
now we need you to crank out a bunch of these.
I actually got asked,

169
00:09:11.551 --> 00:09:15.450
I actually got what one producer asked me.
They said,
no one will ever know.

170
00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:19.920
And I went,
yeah,
they will.
Yeah,
they will.
And I'll know.

171
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:25.470
And that's,
I said,
no,
no,
no.
And along comes the bullshit often.
Well,

172
00:09:25.471 --> 00:09:29.130
it's not their fault.
It's like that's what they do on every other show.

173
00:09:29.131 --> 00:09:31.230
What they do is these artificial scenarios,

174
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:36.430
even whether it's pawn wars are fucking storage wars or oh,

175
00:09:36.631 --> 00:09:39.870
we gotta get this car finished by Friday,
man.
No,
you don't.

176
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:43.830
You don't don't have to get this car.
You do whatever the fuck you want to do.

177
00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:48.630
Whatever.
I thought,
I remember the last,
the last podcast and Mary,

178
00:09:48.631 --> 00:09:53.160
you said you loved reality TV,
you thought and I said,
ah,

179
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:58.010
I hate reality TV,
and I thought that's that's,
I'm not John.
I know you did man.

180
00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:00.833
As

181
00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:09.600
he's mocking,
she knows me better than you.

182
00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:13.710
I don't love reality shows like some shows it look like life below zero.

183
00:10:13.711 --> 00:10:16.050
That's a dope show.
That's a legit show that show,

184
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:20.030
that show they don't fuck around with.
I was liking that Alaska,

185
00:10:20.031 --> 00:10:25.031
the last frontier show until I saw this fucking bear eating a filleted salmon.

186
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:30.690
I'm like,
Oh,
you're baiting the bears.
You assholes.
All that stuff set up.

187
00:10:31.140 --> 00:10:35.190
I mean a lot of them are life below zero is not set up.
I know that for a fact.

188
00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:39.360
That's a show I had this woman sue Akins on the show lives up there 200 miles

189
00:10:39.361 --> 00:10:42.930
above the arctic circle.
That bitch is gangster as fuck.

190
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:46.050
She lives up there by hers.
She got attacked by a bear.

191
00:10:46.051 --> 00:10:50.160
She got fucked up and broke her hip bit into her skull,
fucked her up,

192
00:10:50.161 --> 00:10:51.030
broke her leg.

193
00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:55.980
She went back and shot that bear and eight it pitch doesn't give a fuck.

194
00:10:55.981 --> 00:11:00.270
She got serious years old.
She's a grandmother.
She smoked cigarettes every day.

195
00:11:00.271 --> 00:11:04.110
She drinks whiskey and she lives by herself in a tent because you can't have

196
00:11:04.111 --> 00:11:07.800
permanent structures like that ladies on hundred percent legit.
Okay?

197
00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:09.120
There's that shows legit.

198
00:11:09.210 --> 00:11:13.260
There's a few of those shows where those people live in such bizarre lives.

199
00:11:13.261 --> 00:11:15.840
So you don't have to set up some film.
We need to get water.

200
00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:19.680
We've got to figure out how to make this pump work again,
that's all stage shit.

201
00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.980
They'll pretend something's broken so they have to fix it.

202
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:26.190
So they have some solution to some drama that comes up.

203
00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.230
But if you live in a harsh enough environment,

204
00:11:28.231 --> 00:11:31.920
you don't have to invent the drama.
And that's what you did.
Well you did.

205
00:11:31.921 --> 00:11:35.880
You were the first motherfucker who went out there.
You really were starving.

206
00:11:35.881 --> 00:11:40.410
You would see you on day one and then you would see you five days later you look

207
00:11:40.411 --> 00:11:45.270
like shit.
Like you couldn't fake that you are dehydrated.
You were shrinking.

208
00:11:45.271 --> 00:11:48.810
You would talk about it.
You couldn't sleep.
You had bugs crawling all over you.

209
00:11:48.811 --> 00:11:52.200
Rats running across your fucking sleeping quarters.
Dude,

210
00:11:52.201 --> 00:11:55.930
you really did it and you,
you,
you did it by yourself.

211
00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:59.260
It's so much different than what these fucking people are doing with these

212
00:11:59.261 --> 00:12:01.510
people we're doing.
Is this baby fucking us?

213
00:12:01.710 --> 00:12:04.450
They're feeding us a spoonful of shit.
They're making it out to me.

214
00:12:04.451 --> 00:12:07.750
They're making a mockery of something.
I mean,
Johnny Appleseed

215
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:14.110
before survivorman there,
there was no survival genre.
There wasn't,

216
00:12:14.610 --> 00:12:17.350
and now the PLF,
the plethora of of shows.

217
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:20.350
I was watched one where there was,

218
00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:25.650
let's just say dual people surviving and and San.

219
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:27.410
We've seen that show too.

220
00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:33.480
I know one of those guys,
that guy is long gone.
He,
he,
he's God.

221
00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:37.950
He could see the real guy.
Was He?
No,
he wasn't legitimate.
If you,

222
00:12:38.070 --> 00:12:41.440
if you're going to go barefoot,
okay,
how about this?
No tools.
You fuck.

223
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:43.780
You won't even wear shoes.
How about dare you?

224
00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:48.370
How dare you treat me like fucking lame ignorance.
You don't have shoes on.

225
00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:51.480
What if you don't have shoes?
What have you don't have matches you fuck no,

226
00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:53.560
you don't have a cell phone or gps.
What if,

227
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:56.020
what if the director is not going to say cut and you go back to your hotel room

228
00:12:56.021 --> 00:12:56.854
after this?

229
00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:01.150
That was like the one I was watching the other night that led into my show.

230
00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.280
There was a sort of like,
what will they do next?

231
00:13:03.281 --> 00:13:04.540
They've got us and you'll look at,

232
00:13:04.541 --> 00:13:07.600
and they're crawling out of the snow shelter in the morning looking like they

233
00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:11.120
just had a shower and just pressed their clothing.
It's like,
you know what,

234
00:13:11.121 --> 00:13:15.160
I've been there.
You don't look like that after a night in the fricking snow,

235
00:13:15.161 --> 00:13:17.710
you'll look like hell.
And they're all nice and clean,

236
00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:19.810
the beard trimmed and everything's good.
And it's like,

237
00:13:19.811 --> 00:13:22.270
what's like the walking dead?
The girl with the dark hair,

238
00:13:22.271 --> 00:13:26.290
she's hot as fuck no matter what.
It's never,
never had zits,
you know,

239
00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.190
I love to do a cameo on that show.
She was like perfectly placed mud.

240
00:13:30.370 --> 00:13:33.820
We have an end.
We know Josh McDermitt.
Oh,
he's the fake scientist.

241
00:13:33.821 --> 00:13:37.790
He's a good friend.
I mean,
I mean tell him,
tell him I'm caught up now.
That's,

242
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.750
that showed us so great.
She's as Christ.
That's good.

243
00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:42.190
I do everything through like my son.

244
00:13:42.191 --> 00:13:44.470
I just wait and he was just like pick a show and he was like in the walking dead

245
00:13:44.471 --> 00:13:47.460
is one of those shows.
We got this big screen at home and say,
oh,
I don't know.

246
00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:50.410
I sat down beside him for like a moment.
Oh,
what are you watching?

247
00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:54.820
And like three hours later I'm binge watching,
blocking down like,
Oh shit,

248
00:13:54.821 --> 00:13:58.420
this is awesome.
Binge Walkin Ism Shit.
That just didn't exist in our time.

249
00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:03.190
We never binge watched and show you couldn't do it.
This is a new phenomenon.

250
00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:05.550
People getting bulging discs and shit in their back.

251
00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:09.760
They're sitting for 20 hours in a row.
People go to the hospital.

252
00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:13.690
It was a fucking getting massages.
People are jacked up,
man.

253
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:16.680
Just from binge-watching.
Well God bless science shadow there.

254
00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:18.730
They're putting survivorman marathons on.
Well,

255
00:14:18.731 --> 00:14:22.720
there'll be like eight hours of survivor man shows and I'll get postings from

256
00:14:22.721 --> 00:14:26.090
people's that they're watched,
all of them.
I'm just like,
wow.

257
00:14:26.091 --> 00:14:29.980
How did you go from doing survivorman to survivor man,
big foot.

258
00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:33.250
Now you told the story on our show that I've repeated ad nauseum.

259
00:14:33.251 --> 00:14:37.120
Cause the fascinating story about your first experience with something that you

260
00:14:37.121 --> 00:14:39.130
couldn't explain.
You were in Alaska,

261
00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:43.210
you flew in very remote location and you heard something that sounded like a

262
00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:45.790
primary.
Yeah,
some bipedal priming.

263
00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:52.160
You know what the bottom line was?
I thought,
okay,
who's the one person that can,

264
00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:55.070
you could take and drop in the middle of nowhere,

265
00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:59.570
in a middle of a big foot hot spot and leave him alone to see what happens.
Well,

266
00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:03.860
will be.
Every man has to be you.
It's got to be me.
It's not me.
So I said,
fuck,

267
00:15:03.861 --> 00:15:07.340
let's do it.
I'll do it.
And then I'll go after the like,

268
00:15:07.341 --> 00:15:10.610
cause I know you hate one of the dudes that I went out with Todd standing.

269
00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:14.450
I don't hate him.
I don't know him,
but I know,
I know bullshit.

270
00:15:14.451 --> 00:15:17.780
When I see bullshit.
We'll listen for the first one,
calling the bullshit.

271
00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:21.140
Let me show them an image.
Let's show an image.
Jamie,
pull up this image.

272
00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:26.470
This is a close up of a big foot,

273
00:15:26.541 --> 00:15:31.160
and I'm doing air quotes,
a big foot.
You got this Jamie,
pull that shit up.

274
00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:33.950
Show that show the prior,
right?
Right,
right.
This is a close up.

275
00:15:33.951 --> 00:15:37.490
This dude just got a big foot to stand still.
He's the only guy in history.

276
00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.040
Got a big foot and he's got two other shots like that.

277
00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.040
So the question I asked you is,
the cool part is,

278
00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:48.800
look how bad that looks like a perfectly trimmed here.

279
00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:51.650
Now why does it look totally different in that picture?
Then the other picture,

280
00:15:51.651 --> 00:15:54.770
I get it.
I see what you're doing.
What is that?
What?
Okay,

281
00:15:54.771 --> 00:15:58.550
but let me ask you again just for a second.
Look at it.
Okay,
now what?

282
00:15:58.551 --> 00:16:01.030
F or what don't you?
What if me?
You fuck.

283
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:04.070
What if we're full of shit and it's real?
No,
we're not.

284
00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:07.190
And that's not how we do.
You know why?

285
00:16:07.191 --> 00:16:10.660
Because every animal that lives every fucking animal that lives,
yeah,

286
00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:13.310
looks like that animal.
No animals.

287
00:16:13.311 --> 00:16:16.010
Look at a person in a fucking animal costume.

288
00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.700
When you see something that looks like a person in an animal costume,

289
00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:24.130
it's a person in an animal costume.
It's our outcomes razor or it's actually is.

290
00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:29.210
Nope,
it's 2015 that is some shitty fucking special effects.

291
00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:34.200
That is a dude in a monkey suit.
100% 100% or Syria wrong.

292
00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:40.490
First of all,
what animal that's Harry ever has his hair matted down like that,

293
00:16:40.491 --> 00:16:43.100
like it's combed and I have to say the exact same thing.

294
00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:47.990
Good ass fucking costume pieces that things got aquanet on it.

295
00:16:48.410 --> 00:16:52.640
It's Harrison great in place.
He's working at fast food joint too.

296
00:16:52.641 --> 00:16:57.110
That looks so stupid.
The idea that that could possibly be big foot.
That's,

297
00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.290
that's 100% a human being.
You know why?

298
00:17:00.291 --> 00:17:04.460
Cause it has human being dimensions to its face.
You look at a gorilla,

299
00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:07.070
you look at a chimp,
you'd look at it orangutan,

300
00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.810
they have a different facial structure.
Oh,
100% day.

301
00:17:10.910 --> 00:17:13.820
That's a human facial structure.
Absolutely.

302
00:17:13.821 --> 00:17:17.420
The ratio between the nose and the eyes and the lips and the mouth.
That's,

303
00:17:17.421 --> 00:17:21.980
that's 100% of human being.
I'm a shitty ass task.

304
00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:26.840
Dr. Joseph [inaudible].
I am a scientist.
Okay,
let me do this.

305
00:17:26.841 --> 00:17:31.220
Sorry.
Let me do this way.
Okay.
So,
um,
okay.
Okay,

306
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:35.560
so let's call it the scale of believability.
Okay?
Okay.

307
00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:40.310
And that's a zero.
All right,
so,
so at,
at this point,
let's forget,

308
00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:43.160
let's forget,
let's forget,
anybody who thinks they don't exist at all,
let's just,

309
00:17:43.161 --> 00:17:44.710
Jamie's at a zero.
What does that,

310
00:17:44.711 --> 00:17:49.711
is that zero to zero and you don't to say it's a series

311
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.860
<v 1>like Joe's looking at me.
Everybody wants to say 100% fired man.</v>

312
00:17:57.150 --> 00:18:01.280
He said it's 100% big foot.
I give him a raise.
Jamie,

313
00:18:02.760 --> 00:18:07.570
come on Jimmy.
Come on.
You know,
that's our big foot.
You Lester,
Lester out.

314
00:18:07.571 --> 00:18:11.010
You know,
that's not big.
Fucking,
let me go back to what I was saying.
Come on.

315
00:18:11.011 --> 00:18:14.670
Be Honest.
If you had a bet,
your your beautiful son over there.
Yeah.

316
00:18:14.730 --> 00:18:16.790
If you had a bed his life as to whether or not there's not.

317
00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:21.600
It's not big chunky suit.
That's not tough at all.

318
00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:23.070
That's not even a little tough.

319
00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:25.950
Why is big foot stand still staring at a fucking camera?

320
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:30.300
I saw leading up to this,
I saw the,
Oh,

321
00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:33.780
the shifts to this footage.

322
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:38.040
The footage.
Right,
but you weren't there.
No,
no,
of course.

323
00:18:38.041 --> 00:18:41.850
It's fucking guy you're hanging out with.
No,
not hanging out with him.
Believe me.

324
00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:46.050
Let me,
let me,
I hung out with so many of them now and it's the whole shit.

325
00:18:46.080 --> 00:18:48.990
That's what I want to get at.
Okay.
Okay,
so let's just pretend.

326
00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:52.590
Forget the people who don't think it exists at all.

327
00:18:52.591 --> 00:18:55.680
Let's go to those who thinks that it does.
This is the biggest problem.

328
00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:59.040
You get to scale a believability on the left side of the scale.

329
00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.740
You've got gigantic path.
It goes,
it's a big upright walking ape.

330
00:19:01.741 --> 00:19:04.110
It's the missing link.
Well,
how about you to Jane Goodall?

331
00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:07.580
I'm side of the scale you've got.
Jane Goodall believes it's real.
Right?
Okay.

332
00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:12.120
Exactly.
As an eight as a species neanderthal,
maybe slightly humanoid.

333
00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.400
He keep coming towards the center of the scale.
It's like,
oh,

334
00:19:14.401 --> 00:19:15.450
it's really stealthy.

335
00:19:15.451 --> 00:19:18.210
It's got certain abilities and you keep come close to the middle of the scale.

336
00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:21.080
It's got tons of incredible intelligence and everything.
Okay,

337
00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:25.020
now you hit the middle of the scale.
Okay.
On the far right of the scale,

338
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:26.880
it's always a far right.
The fucks everything.

339
00:19:26.881 --> 00:19:29.670
I know the far right it does because you know what the fire of the scale is?

340
00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:34.860
Aliens.
That's an alien aliens.
So then you go to and on the far right,

341
00:19:34.890 --> 00:19:37.890
it's like paranormal,
walkability,

342
00:19:37.891 --> 00:19:41.240
fifth dimensional vibration will control all sorts of shit like that.

343
00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:44.190
Trail cameras.
So the crazy,
yeah,
they can control electronics.

344
00:19:44.191 --> 00:19:46.830
They can do infrasound and screw you up like a lion or a tiger.

345
00:19:47.070 --> 00:19:51.420
The craziest part is the argument is not between those who don't think it's real

346
00:19:51.421 --> 00:19:55.350
and those who do.
It's within the scope of all the people who think it.
Israel.

347
00:19:55.620 --> 00:20:00.540
That argument is insane.
Like the backstabbing and the fighting.

348
00:20:00.541 --> 00:20:01.320
It's like no.

349
00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.680
And all the eight believers don't want any of the paranormal believers to say

350
00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:07.270
anything cause they're all whacked and screwed up and we don't want them to.

351
00:20:07.470 --> 00:20:10.320
And all the paranormal believers don't want go to the eight believers saying,

352
00:20:10.321 --> 00:20:13.200
well,
you're all close minded.
You're not open to the fact of that does this.

353
00:20:13.201 --> 00:20:17.910
And it does that.
And it's this big cesspool of argumentative like shit going on.

354
00:20:17.911 --> 00:20:19.580
UWF.
Yeah.
So

355
00:20:22.190 --> 00:20:26.460
it's exactly like WWE is a lot of times,
you know what,

356
00:20:26.461 --> 00:20:29.960
that's dad's WWF is like the 90 [inaudible] stands for like what the,

357
00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:34.800
what the fuck?
Whoa,
Whoa,
whoa.
What the fuck that and what I did,

358
00:20:34.801 --> 00:20:36.430
I dove right into that scale.
Right.

359
00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:41.060
And land myself on the land out in the bush with all these different people and

360
00:20:41.061 --> 00:20:42.580
try to be as objective as well.
Yeah.

361
00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:44.400
What I said is don't make me your poster boy.

362
00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:46.590
I don't want to be a poster boy for eight believers.

363
00:20:46.591 --> 00:20:48.400
I don't be your poster boy for Alien Believers.

364
00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:51.130
<v 2>Just put me out there and show me what you got.
Let's back this up.</v>

365
00:20:51.131 --> 00:20:54.280
For people who don't know,
like you learn what a big foot,

366
00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:58.780
gigantic pickers with the fucking gigantic,
gigantic Opeth Agus is a real animal,

367
00:20:58.781 --> 00:21:00.490
did absolutely did exist,

368
00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:05.540
but they only have a few bones and they founded an apothecary shop and China,

369
00:21:05.801 --> 00:21:10.360
and like the 19 early 19 hundreds some guy found some teeth that he knew were

370
00:21:10.361 --> 00:21:14.110
not,
uh,
any known primate.
And then he said,
where'd you get these teeth?

371
00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:18.610
The people that run the apothecary shop lead him to this area.

372
00:21:18.611 --> 00:21:19.870
They do a dig.

373
00:21:19.871 --> 00:21:24.370
They find some job bones that indicate that this animal was most likely a

374
00:21:24.371 --> 00:21:27.370
bipedal primate,
although that's under some dispute.

375
00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:31.150
So what this means is there was something that was somehow or another related to

376
00:21:31.151 --> 00:21:35.020
other primates if they think it might have been in the orangutan family.

377
00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:40.260
But this is a bipedal enormous animal that absolutely existed at the very latest

378
00:21:42.790 --> 00:21:45.070
100,000 years ago.
It could have been earlier,

379
00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:49.120
but they know a hundred thousand years ago,
that thing was alive.

380
00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:50.950
So a hundred thousand years ago,
which were there,

381
00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:52.720
there were 100% human beings at the time.

382
00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.540
There was a fucking eight to 10 foot tall,

383
00:21:55.690 --> 00:22:00.640
gigantic bipedal ape,
which is big foot.
I mean it fun.

384
00:22:00.730 --> 00:22:05.110
It's a real fucking asshole that's going out at one tidbit to that as a fact

385
00:22:05.111 --> 00:22:07.480
that if it doesn't,
if it,
if it's extinct,

386
00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:12.880
it's the only primate from that era that is extinct.

387
00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:14.110
All the rest are still alive.

388
00:22:14.140 --> 00:22:19.140
That's not totally true because that the Flores man that a hobbit man and the

389
00:22:19.961 --> 00:22:20.890
island of Flores,

390
00:22:21.190 --> 00:22:25.000
that little thing is dead and that thing lived closer to today.

391
00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:28.600
They have bones from that little fucker that was like 13,000 years ago.

392
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:31.120
How you know it's dead.
That's true.
Yeah,
that's true.

393
00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:34.600
I mean that's your red pen deck and that's what everybody's saying is how do you

394
00:22:34.601 --> 00:22:36.670
know they're extinct?
I know that it was so intelligent.

395
00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:39.120
They're just hit and the vast forests of North America,

396
00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:42.160
that's a legit question because if you go out to the forest,

397
00:22:42.161 --> 00:22:45.400
you know you don't find scientists,
you know,

398
00:22:45.401 --> 00:22:47.770
I'm fucking fucking finding scientists everywhere.

399
00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:52.000
Serving every inch of the land.
It is quite possible.
Like,
you know,

400
00:22:52.001 --> 00:22:53.560
there's always these weird animals.

401
00:22:53.561 --> 00:22:57.040
They find like that vampire deer that lives in Vietnam.

402
00:22:57.041 --> 00:23:00.430
Like what the fuck is this?
They have some Fang deer,

403
00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:04.620
like they'd talked about it like villagers or talk about,
and then my VA,

404
00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:06.670
you found a Feng dear.
Okay,
good luck with that.

405
00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:09.790
But they really did find this goddamn thing.
See if you pull that up.

406
00:23:09.791 --> 00:23:13.270
Jamie Fang dear,
I think of Vietnam.
This was like,

407
00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:18.010
this is a mythical animal.
The gigantic chip ends chimpanzee they found as well.

408
00:23:18.011 --> 00:23:20.710
Yeah,
the Bondo ape.
That's a real animal as real.

409
00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:24.040
They know now a logical,
until they found it,

410
00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:27.910
the giant squid mythological until they found it.
Just stories.

411
00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:31.170
And that's the whole thing that happens with the cryptozoology look,

412
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:35.110
that's up with just a story.
It's a deer with fangs,
right.
What the fuck is that?

413
00:23:35.111 --> 00:23:37.210
Now,
if I'd said to you before they discovered it,

414
00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:42.040
you know that there's a deer with fat vampire.
Yeah.
And you said not a chance,

415
00:23:42.041 --> 00:23:44.980
man.
They didn't even find one of them.
No.
There's a,
well,

416
00:23:44.990 --> 00:23:48.050
it's a very densely populate or densely wooded area,

417
00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:51.710
but they know there's a family of them living there.
It's not just one.
They've,

418
00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:55.970
they've observed more than one of these weird deer and the,
uh,
the champs,

419
00:23:55.971 --> 00:24:00.170
the Bondo Champs,
they have photographs of them.
They have tissue samples,

420
00:24:00.171 --> 00:24:03.840
they have hair,
they have photographs of dead ones.
The huge,
yeah,

421
00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:06.500
they know for sure.
That's a real animal and it's different.

422
00:24:06.501 --> 00:24:07.970
It has a crust on its forehead.

423
00:24:07.971 --> 00:24:12.350
They have skulls of full intact skull of a recently dead animal and it was a

424
00:24:12.351 --> 00:24:15.440
crest on his forehead,
like a gorilla,
which chimps don't have.

425
00:24:15.441 --> 00:24:19.790
So it's really confusing,
which takes it out of cryptozoology and into,
into,
into,

426
00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:23.060
yeah,
that's the real animals.
I mean,
they have photos of it,

427
00:24:23.061 --> 00:24:23.960
they have videos of it.

428
00:24:23.961 --> 00:24:27.110
They have scientists that have gone down there and seeing him.
Carl Armaun,

429
00:24:27.111 --> 00:24:31.340
he's a Swiss wildlife photographer.
He started being obsessed with it,

430
00:24:31.341 --> 00:24:34.310
I believe in 96 he started going down there to the Congo,

431
00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:38.720
but it's in this really deep,
deep,
deep.
The Congo is giant.

432
00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:43.730
It's like almost as wide as the entire United States and it's just dense jungle.

433
00:24:43.730 --> 00:24:47.090
Like good fucking luck finding what's in there.
Yeah,
I mean,

434
00:24:47.091 --> 00:24:51.380
but that's what you got big foot.
Yeah.
It's the same deference.
You got nobody.

435
00:24:51.530 --> 00:24:52.730
People aren't going,
you get,

436
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:55.950
and then those who were saying they see them or whatever,
they're doctors,

437
00:24:55.951 --> 00:24:58.910
they're lawyers or conservation officers,
they're hunters,
they're anglers,

438
00:24:58.911 --> 00:25:02.200
they're hikers.
They're not all whack job.
You know,

439
00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:06.740
they're not all whack jobs and you're the one guy when everyone,
everyone goes,

440
00:25:06.741 --> 00:25:10.370
ah,
you know,
it's all bullshit.
Like a damn.
I think less know some shit.

441
00:25:10.790 --> 00:25:14.480
You know when you say that you heard something that sounded like a gorilla and

442
00:25:14.481 --> 00:25:19.130
it's in the,
it's possible.
There's like,
who the fuck's,
he's a wolverine.
Okay,

443
00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:20.930
good luck finding a wolverine.

444
00:25:20.931 --> 00:25:23.630
You could wander around the woods of your whole life and never see a wolverine.

445
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:26.990
Never see a dead one.
But they're out there.
We know they're out there.

446
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
Will you take whatever that is and lessen its population by 90% now you have 10%

447
00:25:33.201 --> 00:25:37.670
of that population and it's smart.
You're going to find that elusive.
Exactly.

448
00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:42.840
60,000 black bears on Ontario.
I've never seen a black bird skeleton.
Yeah.
Oh,

449
00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:46.830
where's the bones?
You know?
Well,
60,000 black and never see a black.

450
00:25:46.940 --> 00:25:50.120
You don't surrender to bones.
Yeah.
Bears eat embarrassed council.

451
00:25:50.121 --> 00:25:51.200
Now if you've got,
let's,

452
00:25:51.201 --> 00:25:56.201
let's say there's 8,000 Sasquatch and Ontario and they're secret and there they

453
00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:00.860
are elusive and they're intelligent,
they're smart,
and they bury their bonds.

454
00:26:00.910 --> 00:26:05.200
It's not going to,
I say eight difficult.
I won't say any of that.

455
00:26:06.170 --> 00:26:10.040
I think if there's any,
there's like,
there's 8,000 you really think is that.

456
00:26:10.041 --> 00:26:13.700
And I don't think there's,
it has to be,
I think this one dude,
ah,

457
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:18.990
that was there and pointed out on the shows like this 1950s hairdo you,

458
00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:23.000
it's one through the trees.
Right?
In loch ness.
That's bullshit though.
Okay.
That,

459
00:26:23.001 --> 00:26:26.960
that what we saw.
If there is a big foot,
that's not it.
That's bullshit.
Yeah.

460
00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:29.840
It's 100% bullshit.
That guy's a liar.

461
00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:32.570
And it's unfortunate because people like that,

462
00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.520
these people that want to make shit up,

463
00:26:34.730 --> 00:26:37.340
they confused the fuck out of everybody who wants to believe.

464
00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:39.130
I think it's also confusing that Pete,
you're,

465
00:26:39.131 --> 00:26:41.990
you're using the word big foot when that's not really what it is.

466
00:26:41.991 --> 00:26:44.010
It's more like finding giant,
you know,

467
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:45.280
<v 1>another one,
the big eights</v>

468
00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:52.530
because putting what the original guy that made the big foot name or whatever

469
00:26:52.531 --> 00:26:53.760
this big monster is,

470
00:26:53.761 --> 00:26:56.260
didn't they already find out that it was fake through the whole thing?
Okay,

471
00:26:56.370 --> 00:26:59.220
<v 2>well no,
that guy didn't make the name.
That's the thing.
That's the,</v>

472
00:26:59.221 --> 00:27:00.810
you're talking about the Patterson footage,

473
00:27:00.811 --> 00:27:05.310
which is no big foot came from turning over the construction equipment and all

474
00:27:05.311 --> 00:27:06.420
the tracks that were found

475
00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:09.470
<v 1>and that there was a fake gun guy who came out and said,</v>

476
00:27:09.760 --> 00:27:11.360
but when you look at what was done there,

477
00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:14.930
the faker see there's a problem is when the fakers are faking.

478
00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:18.080
You know what I'm saying?
I'm like,
Oh,
I did that hoax out.
That was all me.

479
00:27:18.081 --> 00:27:20.780
It's like,
no,
it wasn't,
man,
you were drunk in Wisconsin at the time.

480
00:27:20.781 --> 00:27:21.800
It had nothing to do with you.

481
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:25.670
But guys come out and claim to do that and now that really messes up the water

482
00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:27.230
because now you've got someone who's really,

483
00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:31.880
really just try to find out and the hoaxers are our hoaxing,

484
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.920
you know themselves and they didn't actually hoax it.
And,

485
00:27:35.970 --> 00:27:37.940
and that's the stuff that's messed up.

486
00:27:37.941 --> 00:27:41.180
So like the first thing that guy that people point back to that can't remember

487
00:27:41.181 --> 00:27:44.090
the guy's name who had the tracks and show here's his wouldn't track.
She says,

488
00:27:44.091 --> 00:27:47.150
I did those trucks on that time in the 50s with the like,

489
00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:51.020
actually he didn't and he couldn't have pulled off what they found.

490
00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:56.050
Like you would have needed 20 men and major machines and a big conspiracy just

491
00:27:56.121 --> 00:28:00.260
to make a bunch of tracks going up into the bush.
It's not realistic.

492
00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:03.290
That's what I'm,
that's what I'm about a lot is it's the whole thing as well.

493
00:28:03.291 --> 00:28:05.930
It's a hoax.
It's a hoax.
It's a person that's a hooks.
Hang on a second.

494
00:28:05.931 --> 00:28:09.740
How many people are out in the woods dedicating their life to sticking a

495
00:28:09.741 --> 00:28:14.741
fricking track in the mud in the middle of nowhere in the Sierra Nevadas or the

496
00:28:14.871 --> 00:28:19.040
rocky mountains.
They're not doing it.
Nobody's got time for that shit

497
00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.180
<v 2>better.
A better argument I think,</v>

498
00:28:21.181 --> 00:28:24.970
is that the native Americans had over 200 different names for this thing.
Right.

499
00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:27.720
That's what's more interesting to me because they don't really have a lot of

500
00:28:27.721 --> 00:28:30.570
mythological animals in the native American Lore.

501
00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:32.760
There's not a lot of fake animals.
I mean,

502
00:28:32.761 --> 00:28:35.850
there's a few things that they believe in and they had some weird gods that they

503
00:28:35.851 --> 00:28:37.200
worshiped and you know,

504
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:39.950
they believe that they could dance and make it run on the birds certain track.

505
00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:43.470
But you know,
the Thunderbirds thing is a weird one too,
man,

506
00:28:43.650 --> 00:28:47.520
because we know that there were certain species of bird that were enormous that

507
00:28:47.521 --> 00:28:48.354
went extinct.

508
00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:53.070
We also know there's a thing called the terror bird that live before the last

509
00:28:53.070 --> 00:28:55.530
ice age,
uh,
went away.
I believe they,

510
00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:58.740
they got him down to like 10,000 plus years ago.

511
00:28:58.950 --> 00:29:01.260
So it was like you're talking about the pleistocene,
right?

512
00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:06.230
You're talking about planning the saber saber tooth tigers existed.
Yeah.

513
00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:08.430
Woolly mammoths.
Well,
they had this fucking bird,

514
00:29:08.431 --> 00:29:12.750
this giant seven foot tall bird that was like predatory,

515
00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:17.760
that would run around and there's one of them called the shoe bill that lives in

516
00:29:17.761 --> 00:29:22.200
the Congo that they think was like,
have you ever seen that thing?
Christ,

517
00:29:22.201 --> 00:29:25.500
you got to see this fucking thing.
This is a what?
A creepy ass bird.

518
00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:26.820
It's called a shoe bill.

519
00:29:26.821 --> 00:29:31.821
It's a five foot tall prehistoric bird with a giant face like a fucking hatchet

520
00:29:32.551 --> 00:29:33.384
in its face.

521
00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:37.990
It's got this giant like huge bill and it's like,
it's,

522
00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:42.040
it catches fish.
This is crazy.
BBC They did on the

523
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.970
<v 0>Congo.
Look at that God damn thing.
No,
there's a,
there's better ones of it though.</v>

524
00:29:46.030 --> 00:29:49.300
Dick.
There's better ones,
but there's pull up,
uh,
I,

525
00:29:49.301 --> 00:29:52.770
I'm pretty sure it's shoe bill.
Shoe Bill Byrd,
Africa.

526
00:29:52.771 --> 00:29:56.560
There is it below that.
That one right there below it that,
yeah,

527
00:29:56.561 --> 00:29:58.870
that one neuron all the way.
Yeah.
I see the one in the middle.

528
00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:01.620
The one that went to Jack in that bird.
Yeah,
that one.

529
00:30:01.621 --> 00:30:05.380
They were just clicking on that fucking thing.
Look at that thing.

530
00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:10.410
Make that bigger,
jammy.
Look at that goddamn creepy ass animal.
Yeah,

531
00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:12.760
it's killing the duck.
You hate ducks.

532
00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:14.590
Now go back and there's another one in that,

533
00:30:14.591 --> 00:30:18.430
in that a series of images right below that we see that thing face on.

534
00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:21.070
Look at that word.
It's looking at you head on when you see it's bill.

535
00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:25.150
What a creepy fuck that is.
That's a real bird.

536
00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:30.510
What a creepy goddamn dinosaur that thinks five feet tall and it walks around

537
00:30:31.511 --> 00:30:33.340
like a fucking like a fake animal.

538
00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:39.130
Dark crystal and it jacks things in the water.
It's a horrible looking monster.

539
00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:40.360
You already tapped into something.

540
00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:43.810
You're really super right about the whole native American perspective on Big

541
00:30:43.811 --> 00:30:44.560
Foot and all that.

542
00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:47.200
If you go up into Winnipeg and I was up there with them up there,

543
00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:48.490
they've got like their,
you know,

544
00:30:48.491 --> 00:30:51.700
their seven teachings and stuff and they're based on the Raven and the wolf and

545
00:30:51.701 --> 00:30:55.780
the Fox and the bear.
And right in the middle is savvy,

546
00:30:56.220 --> 00:31:01.060
big foot.
And then the Eagle and the audit,
I think it's just like,

547
00:31:01.540 --> 00:31:04.220
it's not like,
oh yeah,
and there's a thunder bird.
There's a mythological this,
no,

548
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:07.840
no,
it's just seven normal animals.
And in the,

549
00:31:07.841 --> 00:31:12.430
in that span of seven normal animals right in the middle is big foot.

550
00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:16.540
What they consider to be a normal species that's there.

551
00:31:16.541 --> 00:31:17.710
They don't make the difference.

552
00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:20.230
They don't differentiate right now to someone on the subway going,

553
00:31:20.231 --> 00:31:24.190
fuck you Joe Rogan.
I'm shutting this podcast.
Listen to me,
man.

554
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:26.290
We're not saying the big foot's real.
That's not what I'm saying.

555
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:30.660
What I'm saying is that God damn animal was definitely real.
We don't know.

556
00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:35.140
What are you saying?
We know that God damn animal [inaudible] was real.

557
00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:39.700
And here's where it's crazy.
It was real in the exact area.

558
00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:43.900
We absolutely know the human beings migrated from,

559
00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:47.880
they migrated from Asia across the Bering strait when it was a landmass.

560
00:31:48.010 --> 00:31:50.350
When you can cross it walking,

561
00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:55.470
they came to North America and where an animal like that would exist would be in

562
00:31:55.601 --> 00:32:00.460
the heavily dense forest of the Pacific northwest was exactly where he would

563
00:32:00.461 --> 00:32:04.330
come across.
They would come across through Alaska to the Pacific northwest,

564
00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:06.460
and that's where you hear about them.
It's,

565
00:32:06.461 --> 00:32:11.461
it doesn't make sense that you would have a real animal that lived in a real

566
00:32:12.401 --> 00:32:15.340
place that you absolutely know existed,

567
00:32:15.341 --> 00:32:18.160
coexisted with human beings that were just like you and I.

568
00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.630
We've been in this form,

569
00:32:19.690 --> 00:32:24.610
essentially they s the scientists believe for 250,000 plus years,

570
00:32:24.790 --> 00:32:26.260
so a hundred thousand years ago,

571
00:32:26.350 --> 00:32:29.860
they know this thing lived and they know it lived where people were walking

572
00:32:29.861 --> 00:32:33.490
around and they were walking all the way to America.
So the question is,

573
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.300
are they still there?
That's the question.
One of the things,
the,

574
00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:37.180
another question I'd like to ask,

575
00:32:37.181 --> 00:32:42.110
what do you do with someone who's you respect you admire?

576
00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:46.690
They're normal.
They're saying,
and then they say to you,
look man,
fuck,

577
00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:47.930
I don't care what you think.

578
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:53.090
I'm just telling you what I saw and I know what I saw.

579
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:56.900
And that happens a thousand freaking dimes.
People do drugs.

580
00:32:57.050 --> 00:33:00.350
The people that people are delusional,
mass delusion,
like psychotic,

581
00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:05.480
right or not or not.
Or they want you to love them.

582
00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:09.030
So they just want to talk about big foot.
Really,
man.
No,

583
00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:12.860
there's over Mike's House.
These people,
these are people with nothing to gain,

584
00:33:12.861 --> 00:33:14.750
lots to lose,
no money to make.

585
00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:17.240
And in fact half the time you can't even drag the story out of them.

586
00:33:17.250 --> 00:33:19.150
Like I'm like,
okay,
fine.
All right,
I'm going to tell these.

587
00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:24.090
That's like girls who don't pretend they don't want to fuck her
girlfriends.

588
00:33:24.150 --> 00:33:27.140
They will tell you some stuff.
I've never actually done this before.

589
00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:31.280
Don't believe him.
I can't believe I'm doing this well,

590
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:35.780
how do you know how to do that with my ass?
They know they've been there.

591
00:33:35.781 --> 00:33:39.800
They're liars.
That's an in Georgia.
He's King of the analogy.

592
00:33:40.730 --> 00:33:41.271
Listen man,

593
00:33:41.271 --> 00:33:46.271
I think it's entirely possible that there is an undiscovered primate fascinated

594
00:33:47.781 --> 00:33:50.060
by this.
You wanted,
you were supposed to come out with me though,

595
00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:56.680
not pussy down this one to see a give you some time on your own and you found it

596
00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:01.970
and then if you didn't,
I confirm my suspicions.
Here's the problem,
man.

597
00:34:01.971 --> 00:34:03.530
These guys,
they go looking for it.

598
00:34:03.531 --> 00:34:06.560
They're almost all full of shit and a lot of them are nice guys,

599
00:34:06.561 --> 00:34:07.670
but they're true believers.

600
00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:12.140
They're true believers in a sense where they're not looking at things
rationally,

601
00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:16.680
they're not looking at things objective.
And so that's what I do.
You survivor,

602
00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:17.953
man,

603
00:34:22.130 --> 00:34:23.010
Dennis talking,

604
00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:28.010
it'll pull the truth right out of your bones.

605
00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:33.350
So that's what happened though was survivorman big foot.
Big Foot is I'm saying.

606
00:34:33.410 --> 00:34:36.170
Okay.
All right.
Okay.
Okay.

607
00:34:36.171 --> 00:34:40.540
You got big foot and some alien space ships.
Leave me in that valley overnight.

608
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:41.440
Couple minutes.
Let's see what else.

609
00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:45.590
You've got gigantic mythic goes and a herd of 12 of them.
Okay.

610
00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:48.980
Leave me in the valley.
Let me see it.
Let's cut to the short and curlies.

611
00:34:50.300 --> 00:34:55.160
What?
What have you seen?
What is the craziest Shit that you've seen?

612
00:34:56.030 --> 00:34:58.460
What is the one thing that you've seen that you think you could bring up?

613
00:34:58.790 --> 00:35:02.150
You gotta.
You gotta have to watch the episode.
Fuck Outta here dude.

614
00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:06.230
Knock it up high.
So on,
on one of the episodes.
So here.
All right.

615
00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:08.900
I'm one of the episodes of joint.
Can't believe shut up.

616
00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:12.290
I'm going to tell you so you don't have to watch the episode.
Okay,

617
00:35:12.291 --> 00:35:14.630
so spoiler alert on the episode,
you watch the episode,

618
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:18.920
we're going to go up to the top of the mountain and radio and everybody hears,

619
00:35:18.930 --> 00:35:23.900
spoiler finding big foot ain't finance shit.
There's a spoiler.
Hey,

620
00:35:23.901 --> 00:35:27.530
if I,
if,
if,
if I had for you the definitive footage,
here it is.

621
00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:30.140
Obviously by now I would've done a press conference.
Exactly.

622
00:35:30.141 --> 00:35:34.970
That's why the foot footage is bullshit right here.
Eat that.
Took a hit of that.

623
00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.133
Tell you the truth.

624
00:35:37.910 --> 00:35:42.660
We'll talk to you when you're surviving animal food in plastic and then eat it

625
00:35:42.661 --> 00:35:46.020
and then poop it out and eat it later.
Like I'd take the plastic off and eat it.

626
00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:53.000
Jesus Christ.
It seems like it could work.
That's a technique I've never thought.

627
00:35:53.010 --> 00:35:55.380
I mean,
if you're going to be like on your own for five days,

628
00:35:55.381 --> 00:35:56.340
you can eat a bunch of food,

629
00:35:56.341 --> 00:35:59.460
but wrap it up in plastic and then later poop it out then and take it out with

630
00:35:59.461 --> 00:35:59.611
them.

631
00:35:59.611 --> 00:36:01.960
How would you get the nutrients from the food and the first place when we get to

632
00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:02.803
your stomach,

633
00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:06.180
poop it out and understanding meaning like it and then you poop it out and like

634
00:36:06.210 --> 00:36:07.530
before you leave for your trip,

635
00:36:07.531 --> 00:36:10.860
go to go get stuffed like Boston market or something.

636
00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:15.420
Throw in this where you're poorly thought out ideas and then get a bunch of

637
00:36:15.421 --> 00:36:19.980
plastic.
Don't tell him stop,
can't,
can't tell.
Got to eat his poop.
No,
no,
no.

638
00:36:21.690 --> 00:36:24.480
I'm saying like eat like a big meal before you're about to leave.

639
00:36:24.481 --> 00:36:28.510
And he would eat his own food.
It's called the youth.

640
00:36:28.511 --> 00:36:30.930
It's called second harvest.
And then native Americans,

641
00:36:30.931 --> 00:36:34.140
they maybe take a bunch of like protein bars,
wrap them up in plastic,
eat it,

642
00:36:34.141 --> 00:36:37.010
and then poop it out in a couple of days and then unwrap the plastic they need.

643
00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:41.310
What kind of Shit?
A fucking whole protein bar.

644
00:36:42.150 --> 00:36:44.460
Plastic can make it through your digestive track.

645
00:36:45.500 --> 00:36:48.840
Carry the bars in my backpack and just eat 'em three days later,

646
00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:52.980
porous understanding of the human digestive track ever exhibited on a podcast.

647
00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:54.600
I was trying to figure out what you were saying.

648
00:36:54.601 --> 00:36:55.770
I thought you were saying eating poop.

649
00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:59.910
You're not talking about a little Baggie of heroin that a drug mule and I was

650
00:36:59.911 --> 00:37:02.000
thinking like maybe going to make you survive.
You'll,

651
00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:04.890
you'll get another hour's worth of energy from that little heroin bag.

652
00:37:04.891 --> 00:37:08.330
What about petite fed liaison?
He,

653
00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:11.670
he announces wrapped in plastic.
You're going to die.

654
00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.890
People get diverticulitis cause they get a fucking watermelon seeds stuck in

655
00:37:15.930 --> 00:37:18.120
word diverticulitis.
Mayonnaise.

656
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:24.020
Well Brock Lesnar one from the UFC,
God brought divert diverticulitis,

657
00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:27.150
serious operation when they remove 12 inches of his colon.

658
00:37:27.151 --> 00:37:28.140
Then I found out about it.

659
00:37:28.141 --> 00:37:30.930
I looked into it and I thought it was just because of eating meat,

660
00:37:30.931 --> 00:37:33.840
but Anthony Bordain informed me that you can eat a seed.

661
00:37:33.870 --> 00:37:38.310
Like you get like a sunflower seeds or something stuck inside your tract,

662
00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:42.420
your digestive track and it starts an abscess and you'd get sick.
Yeah,
you could.

663
00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:45.600
You can die from a fucking seed getting stuck.
He's like,

664
00:37:45.601 --> 00:37:48.870
all kinds of stuff gets stuck in there,
so it's not necessarily just protein.

665
00:37:49.080 --> 00:37:50.310
There's also control.

666
00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:56.220
The board game is like a Gi tract doctor now you can't eat a Petite Philemon Yon

667
00:37:56.711 --> 00:37:59.010
Shit it out in the woods,
son.
That's all I'm saying.

668
00:37:59.550 --> 00:38:03.270
You gotta have to have a better strategy than that ever.

669
00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:06.150
I guess I was thinking survivor island,
like trying to find a way to cheat.

670
00:38:06.330 --> 00:38:09.570
You can't,
you can't.
You just carry it in your backpack.
You're pregnant.

671
00:38:09.571 --> 00:38:13.880
If you had enough food for a day,
all the food packed up through your body.

672
00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:18.400
What can a calorie consumption are you thinking you're going to have?
You know,

673
00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:20.640
you got to go on a diet.
That's one thing he could do.

674
00:38:20.641 --> 00:38:24.750
You could get fat as fuck and then go out there and just live off your fat for a

675
00:38:24.750 --> 00:38:27.900
few days.
That would actually work like you would could.
I never ever,

676
00:38:27.901 --> 00:38:29.010
and all of a survivor man shows.

677
00:38:29.011 --> 00:38:32.310
I never ever prepared for the show by either trying to trim down and make my

678
00:38:32.311 --> 00:38:35.710
stomach smaller or by bulking up and having all the extra.
I was figure,

679
00:38:35.711 --> 00:38:36.220
well then that's

680
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:39.310
<v 1>not even realistic either.
Whenever I start something,
it's gotta be like,
I just,</v>

681
00:38:39.490 --> 00:38:41.830
you know,
it was going somewhere else and got lost.

682
00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:44.790
You too honest for television and we can't use you anymore.
I know.

683
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:49.870
That's super pseudoscience channel.
What you just said.
I mean,
that is,

684
00:38:49.871 --> 00:38:52.640
what am I?
I've,
I haven't,
I've been told before it,
you know,

685
00:38:52.641 --> 00:38:55.860
unless that's a bit too earnest.
I'm like,
Oh God,
no.

686
00:38:55.950 --> 00:38:58.660
Let's get back to the short and curlies they want.
Have you seen,

687
00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:03.380
what have you seen at the top of the mountain and radium?
Radium.
Where's that?

688
00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:07.990
Radium Springs.
British Columbia.
First time of my life ever.
That's a big area,

689
00:39:07.991 --> 00:39:11.580
right?
Big highlight.
High Salt.
It's a smaller settings here.

690
00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:16.180
First time ever.
First of all,
I've never,
I've never claimed this.

691
00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:19.540
I saw big freaking lights in the sky.
Couldn't explain.

692
00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:22.920
I'm like looking at what the,
and I'm there.

693
00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:26.200
They are just the whole classic Ufo thing.
It was like,
what the,

694
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:28.910
never seen anything like that.
I don't,
I don't claim anything like that.

695
00:39:28.930 --> 00:39:31.270
While you were filming the show while I'm on the top of the mountain,

696
00:39:31.271 --> 00:39:32.950
when I'm filming the show,
I'm looking at the big,

697
00:39:32.951 --> 00:39:35.800
these big ass lights way bigger.
If it was a plane,

698
00:39:35.801 --> 00:39:40.801
it was bigger than the Concord and they just hovered there and gone like that.

699
00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:46.660
Just gone.
Then that same night and some other shit happened,

700
00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:50.710
I woke up and I swear I was in my mommy sleeping bag and I swear something was

701
00:39:50.711 --> 00:39:53.620
sitting on top of me and I couldn't move.
I tried to move and it wasn't like,

702
00:39:53.621 --> 00:39:56.440
you know,
you wake up in a half,
half dream Army were sleeping on.

703
00:39:56.441 --> 00:39:58.780
It's like all frozen.
You're like,
oh shit.
A wolf seeding my arm.

704
00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:00.520
Know this was like the arm on top.

705
00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:02.710
Who the fuck has Jane's got wolves eating their arms.

706
00:40:02.890 --> 00:40:05.620
Don't you sleep in the woods alone too much,
man.

707
00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:09.560
That's what's what you dream about when ever dreamed about getting a c,

708
00:40:09.660 --> 00:40:11.140
you got to come on and do one of these shows with me.

709
00:40:11.141 --> 00:40:14.530
You'll dream about wolves eat and your arms to him.
Hopefully.
No,

710
00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:18.430
I don't want that dream.
It's not a good dream.
Yeah.

711
00:40:18.431 --> 00:40:21.370
The problem is that actually can happen if things go horribly wrong.

712
00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:24.790
Wolf can eat your,
I've been surrounded by wolves while you're out there.
I have,

713
00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:29.320
yes,
I have.
Yup.
I've had them.
I can see them.
There's one,
there's another.

714
00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:31.660
And what were they doing?
They were checking in.
Following,

715
00:40:31.661 --> 00:40:35.260
checking you out of topics.
Yeah.
The checkout is a by yourself.
It's scary.

716
00:40:36.010 --> 00:40:38.110
Although many majors,
you know what it better than that.

717
00:40:38.650 --> 00:40:43.000
Not even a week ago today and they had to spend the majority of the night in a

718
00:40:43.001 --> 00:40:46.300
tree because it was a literally not sensationalizing.

719
00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:50.440
This was a man eating tart tiger down below me on the ground.
What?

720
00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:55.280
Like less than a week ago.
What?
India.
Oh my God.

721
00:40:55.650 --> 00:41:00.070
I did my first survivor man.
Shoot in India.
Fuck,
are you doing fuck that noise.

722
00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:05.030
Oh my God.
Where would you like in the sooner pants?

723
00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:09.280
I was,
uh,
up in,
uh,
you know,
the Jim Corbett Park area in northern India,

724
00:41:09.281 --> 00:41:10.420
north of Delhi,
uh,

725
00:41:10.530 --> 00:41:15.530
about five hour drive north of Delhi and a into the forest there.

726
00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:20.590
And
I was like,
Oh,
you know,
this area is not that bad.
Last when I got there,

727
00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:21.760
after I was there,

728
00:41:22.450 --> 00:41:26.410
I was told that I was dropped in the densest population of tigers in the world,

729
00:41:26.411 --> 00:41:29.980
royal Bengal,
tiger dense population,
the world.
And then she says to me this,

730
00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:34.810
the Madam and she is,
she goes,
well,
and then the one we have,
uh,

731
00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:38.180
has killed 21 people this year so far,
but it's okay.

732
00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:42.260
She only recently started eating the corpses and like,
you gotta be kidding me.

733
00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:45.740
And they told me this after I got out and then I saw a tiger on the first night.

734
00:41:45.741 --> 00:41:46.910
On the second night I heard a growl.

735
00:41:46.911 --> 00:41:49.540
I had to go up into a tree and I spend a majority of the night and I'm,

736
00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:51.880
that's all filmed.
Like I'm filming myself for Survivorman.

737
00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:55.370
I got the whole selfie thing going on and I'm like,
all right.

738
00:41:55.371 --> 00:41:59.060
And I had to like pull my camera up with a rope and I'm holding the camera and

739
00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:01.580
I'm like,
okay,
I'm starting not in sleep,

740
00:42:01.581 --> 00:42:03.560
but just sat and waited and waited and see.

741
00:42:03.561 --> 00:42:07.110
That to me is so much more interesting than that bullshit monkey fake.

742
00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:12.080
That's real shit and big foot.
Yeah,
I know.
That's real shit.

743
00:42:12.081 --> 00:42:13.400
I mean that's a real animal.

744
00:42:13.401 --> 00:42:17.540
I mean if there was a big foot and there was also a tiger,
okay,
if these,

745
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:20.930
absolutely.
We're real thing that,
that,
I put that up on my Twitter the other day.

746
00:42:20.931 --> 00:42:23.780
That's a classic video.
Somebody tweeted it to me and it just,

747
00:42:24.110 --> 00:42:28.760
it's the one thing I'm the most afraid of actually is tigers territory.

748
00:42:28.761 --> 00:42:32.420
But show that again,
Jamie,
this is a video.
We're looking at their posts,

749
00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:37.480
folks who are just listening to this video of this tiger flying through the air

750
00:42:38.511 --> 00:42:41.090
and attacking this guy who's on this elephant.

751
00:42:41.091 --> 00:42:44.300
He's sitting on the top of the elephant and the tiger just decides,

752
00:42:44.301 --> 00:42:49.010
fuck this dude.
And he jumps up through the air fly.

753
00:42:49.011 --> 00:42:52.330
It's lucky he didn't get gored by the,
by the bull elephant with the tusks.
Well,

754
00:42:52.331 --> 00:42:53.390
he get the,
well,

755
00:42:53.391 --> 00:42:57.430
the elephant didn't want to have nothing to do with that fucking cat,
but the,
um,

756
00:42:57.470 --> 00:43:02.030
the guy got fucked up when that thing clauses army tore his arm apart.

757
00:43:02.330 --> 00:43:06.290
Those are razorblades end to be super powerful Predator.

758
00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:10.670
That's what was basically 70 yards away from me.
Man.

759
00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:13.700
I can't believe you didn't like fully researched this.

760
00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:20.210
I thought I did.
It's like what are the worst fucking camping ideas ever?

761
00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:24.890
When you go to India,
you renegotiate everything you do every hour.

762
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:28.600
Every hour is a new renegotiation.
Really?
How so?
We're going to have like,

763
00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:31.190
this person's going to be,
they're going to lead you in an hour later.

764
00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:34.730
So this person's not here,
but we're going to my buddy,

765
00:43:34.731 --> 00:43:37.880
my cousin's going to lead you in an hour later.
My cousin couldn't make it.

766
00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:38.631
And when you can't,

767
00:43:38.631 --> 00:43:41.780
you're not allowed to go in any way because the government says it's just like

768
00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:43.610
every hour was going like that.
So get this.

769
00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:46.280
I go out and probably think you're crazy.
They do think you're nuts.

770
00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:50.390
So I went out to do my first night of survivor man alone.
I'm out in the jungle,

771
00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:55.730
I'm out there.
And,
um,
I'm like,
I'm feeling myself.
I'm like,

772
00:43:55.731 --> 00:43:57.280
all right.
You know,
when you have to do a zoom,

773
00:43:57.290 --> 00:43:59.810
probably doing to stay here and stay here for the night sort of thing.

774
00:43:59.811 --> 00:44:01.700
Get a fire going and doing the whole thing.

775
00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:05.900
I hear some noise and I,
and I,

776
00:44:05.970 --> 00:44:10.970
I go back about four or 500 yards and,
and in the middle of the jungle,

777
00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:11.530
the debt,

778
00:44:11.530 --> 00:44:16.460
the fucking forest 50 people show up and have a Lord Shiva Rave.

779
00:44:16.670 --> 00:44:17.503
And all of a sudden I hear

780
00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:21.980
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

781
00:44:23.770 --> 00:44:27.790
<v 1>and I'm literally,
so I'm in the middle of the forest surviving right now.</v>

782
00:44:28.690 --> 00:44:31.980
Wow.
It was the most bizarre thing.
And it turns out this

783
00:44:31.980 --> 00:44:35.550
<v 0>one time of the whole year in this remote little place where there's this stone</v>

784
00:44:35.551 --> 00:44:38.640
in the forest is the Lord Shiva stone.
All these people,

785
00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:42.300
like 50 people on motorcycles showed up.
And I'm like,

786
00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:45.180
so I'm gonna,
I'm gonna walk deeper that way.

787
00:44:45.181 --> 00:44:47.100
Cause there's tigers and at least they're quiet.

788
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:52.430
And you know what's really bizarre is that there's a big push to save the tiger

789
00:44:52.651 --> 00:44:57.651
in India is a big push to make sure that the murders of humans have healthy

790
00:44:58.081 --> 00:45:01.440
populations,
whereas scare,
we don't want them to go away.

791
00:45:01.750 --> 00:45:05.340
Now come on.
It's weird.
Those are weird.

792
00:45:05.341 --> 00:45:08.280
I'm not saying that we should encourage extinction because they are,

793
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:09.920
even though they're well,

794
00:45:09.921 --> 00:45:14.100
are terrifying and they're predatory and they're dangerous.
They're a beautiful,

795
00:45:14.101 --> 00:45:17.640
amazing life form.
I mean,
I don't want tigers to go extent.

796
00:45:17.641 --> 00:45:19.200
I don't want to be anywhere near them,

797
00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:22.170
but I don't want them to go extinct because I think they're fascinating.

798
00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:23.960
They're great.
They're fast hot.

799
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:27.660
Then you don't go camping where they eat,

800
00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:30.030
so you just,
now that's a thing.

801
00:45:30.031 --> 00:45:32.760
It's like you got to allow the tiger to be the tiger.

802
00:45:32.761 --> 00:45:37.680
If you go and you sleep in an area that's rich with polar bears are tigers and

803
00:45:37.681 --> 00:45:41.640
you have a tiger,
a polar bear problem,
right?
It's like,
well,

804
00:45:41.641 --> 00:45:44.370
why am I having this issue with polar bears because you're sleeping in polar

805
00:45:44.371 --> 00:45:47.750
bear territory,
idiot.
Like isn't this their world?
There's an issue

806
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:51.060
<v 2>area in the India called the cinder bands,</v>

807
00:45:51.061 --> 00:45:54.840
and there's an issue with the water because the water is like got too much salt

808
00:45:54.841 --> 00:45:57.270
in it.
So the animals that irritated all the time,

809
00:45:57.510 --> 00:46:00.080
and there's a lot of typhoons in that area.
So the,

810
00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:03.630
a lot of people die and they get washed into the river and the Tigers develop a

811
00:46:03.631 --> 00:46:04.740
taste for human flesh.

812
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:08.370
So it's one of the rare places where they're actively hunting people on a

813
00:46:08.371 --> 00:46:11.910
regular basis.
And the last two months it's not that rare.
No,

814
00:46:11.911 --> 00:46:15.030
it's not right at all.
I just got,
I sang,
she got back from India lesson five,

815
00:46:15.060 --> 00:46:19.660
six days ago.
It's not,
the tiger attacks are normal.

816
00:46:19.690 --> 00:46:22.380
Super Common.
They're normal.
So their,
their way of life,

817
00:46:22.381 --> 00:46:26.370
they're thinking about what life is.
It's so different than us at any moment.

818
00:46:26.371 --> 00:46:28.230
They get snatched away by a monster.

819
00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:33.620
At any moment you're walking from a lake or a river to your family in a hut and

820
00:46:34.291 --> 00:46:38.700
you hear a twig snap and you turn and you see this 800 pound thing already in

821
00:46:38.701 --> 00:46:43.050
the air on it's way to you.
And they know that's a wraps on [inaudible] deputy.

822
00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:46.320
That's all folks life in the Bush and life in the jungle,
man.

823
00:46:46.590 --> 00:46:51.590
You feel that fucking blade slice into your juggler crushed down your vertebrae?

824
00:46:53.520 --> 00:46:57.000
<v 0>I'd wear deodorant.
Were to blame.</v>

825
00:46:57.400 --> 00:47:01.150
<v 2>Yeah.
He set up a new word.
It's the word of God displayed.</v>

826
00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:04.780
Now's not the time for grammar.
Talking about it.

827
00:47:05.060 --> 00:47:08.530
We're singing can do somewhat correct their grammar.
You slept in a fucking tree.

828
00:47:08.570 --> 00:47:13.350
Yields stayed up there in a tree.
No.
When do you feel confident enough to climb?

829
00:47:15.020 --> 00:47:17.450
<v 0>Fuck.
All right.
So you know why I knew the tiger was there.</v>

830
00:47:17.490 --> 00:47:21.150
The monkeys started going crazy.
The peacock started going crazy.
They all,

831
00:47:21.360 --> 00:47:24.080
they all react.
They're all like,
Holy Shit.
And they,

832
00:47:24.081 --> 00:47:26.820
all the monkeys go up high and they're like,
wow.
Right.
And you know,

833
00:47:26.821 --> 00:47:31.020
and you're looking and you know,
nothing's going on over there.
There's been,

834
00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:33.460
there's a tiger slowly moving through.
You don't hear any twig.

835
00:47:33.461 --> 00:47:38.110
Snap for a tag and you see it.
I saw it.
Yeah,
I saw it on the,
uh,
the night before.

836
00:47:38.111 --> 00:47:42.010
I saw it go across the field that night.
I didn't see it.
I heard it growl,

837
00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:44.770
which was even scarier.
Oh my God.
The monkeys all saw it.

838
00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:47.050
They were all so ain't get so,
and you have to be,

839
00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:49.410
and he's 12 feet up the tree because they can,

840
00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:54.070
they can jump and kind of reach up to 12 feet.
Oh my God.
Yeah.

841
00:47:54.071 --> 00:47:58.120
There's a video of messed up.
There's a video of them,
uh,
attacking some meat.

842
00:47:58.420 --> 00:47:58.871
They A,

843
00:47:58.871 --> 00:48:02.560
they hold it up in the air and the Tigers leap up to get it and you watch it.

844
00:48:02.561 --> 00:48:07.120
You like,
what is that possible that can really pull that video up.

845
00:48:07.121 --> 00:48:08.770
Damien is the most ridiculous video.

846
00:48:08.771 --> 00:48:12.850
This is guy who holds this meetup and this tiger just does something that you

847
00:48:12.851 --> 00:48:15.790
just,
you'd go,
oh,
I kind of like,

848
00:48:16.070 --> 00:48:19.690
I never internalized what it looks like when they jump 12 feet in the air.

849
00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:24.600
Like why watch this?
They hold this meetup,
look at this thing,
this thing fucking,

850
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:29.630
that spring flies and grab its head is like 14 feet in the air.

851
00:48:30.670 --> 00:48:35.170
That's why I climbed at least 12 feet up the tray.
My God,
watch that again.

852
00:48:35.171 --> 00:48:37.390
That's insane.
That animals,

853
00:48:37.391 --> 00:48:41.580
just what it can do with its body to kill things.
I mean it's,

854
00:48:41.650 --> 00:48:45.340
that's what it's designed for,
but the fact that they're sitting there,

855
00:48:45.520 --> 00:48:50.520
these two giant cancer sitting there watching this person feed them like what

856
00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:55.690
Ah,
bizarro world is that has just a bit tuition,
their fence,

857
00:48:55.750 --> 00:49:00.670
they're fenced in and this guy is holding this thing in a crane up in the air

858
00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:04.090
and the tiger jumps up and grabs it.
It's insane.
They're powerful man.

859
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:07.810
Now you don't have web kit and you can,
no,
no,
I didn't crack.

860
00:49:07.811 --> 00:49:11.200
There was an area I was in and uh,
they use the force.

861
00:49:11.230 --> 00:49:14.410
They do of course forces always there.

862
00:49:14.890 --> 00:49:17.650
They wouldn't let me go into an area without an armed guard,
armed guard.

863
00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:20.200
I was like,
Oh dude,
I'm like,
survivor,
man,
I've got to go out.

864
00:49:20.201 --> 00:49:21.780
I got to do this thing and then I've got to be alone.

865
00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:25.460
We do not tell the truth to that.
And,

866
00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:28.810
and I wasn't allowed to be out there without it,
without an armed guard.

867
00:49:29.050 --> 00:49:30.070
So they had land.

868
00:49:30.071 --> 00:49:35.071
I was like maybe half a half a maybe a quarter mile away was like actually pair

869
00:49:35.081 --> 00:49:36.370
of armed guards on either cloud.

870
00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:41.550
While I know whack his guards cause you to be like three feet away.

871
00:49:42.820 --> 00:49:45.460
I'm thinking if this thing 75 yards from Maine and pounces on me,

872
00:49:45.461 --> 00:49:49.030
how fast are you going to get here?
Miles.
A long time.

873
00:49:49.031 --> 00:49:53.230
It takes a long time to get and here's on foot from a quarter of what it does.

874
00:49:53.231 --> 00:49:55.000
Yeah.
How fast can you run a mile?

875
00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:58.120
Like a really fast mile is like a four minute mile.
Right?

876
00:49:58.121 --> 00:50:00.040
That's like the thing that no one thought you could ever do.

877
00:50:00.370 --> 00:50:03.280
So one fourth of that one is a minute.

878
00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:06.130
So stop and think about that on a track.
Yeah,
but,

879
00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:09.340
but just stop and think about a minute of running.
That's what it is.

880
00:50:09.341 --> 00:50:11.080
If you're the like the fastest guy ever,

881
00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:15.700
you run for a minute to get to you to flip the fuck a tiger can do to you.

882
00:50:15.850 --> 00:50:20.850
And why met 89885750650 five you're fucking torn to show rads.

883
00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:31.130
It's like you with a roach,
like literally as for Roche,

884
00:50:31.170 --> 00:50:35.240
as you had terror,
roaches,
body apart.
That's what a tiger could do to you.

885
00:50:35.480 --> 00:50:36.140
It's insane.

886
00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:39.380
The powerful and you're sleeping about or hanging out in a tree above it and of

887
00:50:39.381 --> 00:50:41.300
course you're not going to,
I'm going to give a super shot out.

888
00:50:41.330 --> 00:50:45.440
The fact that they're actually 30% increasing in population in this one area,

889
00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:48.860
which is phenomenal because they are beautiful,
so awesome.

890
00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:49.940
I think there's enough powerful,

891
00:50:49.941 --> 00:50:54.730
beautiful now 72 of them and make sure they fuck,
we need more,

892
00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:59.210
actually need more of them.
Jesus fall on.
I went more.
Sure.

893
00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:03.770
Yeah.
It seems like there's more big foot than there are than there are tigers.

894
00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:08.210
Oh,
well I don't know about that because I've seen a tiger.

895
00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:11.930
I've,
I've,
I've seen it with my own eyes at the zoo.

896
00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:15.260
You in this big foot thing.

897
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:18.320
What if they dropped off one tiger a year in Los Angeles,

898
00:51:18.321 --> 00:51:19.910
but they don't tell you where it's at.
Well,

899
00:51:19.911 --> 00:51:22.160
they kind of have mountain lions wandering around.

900
00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:24.380
They usually don't fuck anybody up.

901
00:51:24.650 --> 00:51:28.100
I got to get this guy out just like out in the bush.
No,
you know,
no,

902
00:51:28.101 --> 00:51:30.770
you need to like have like some shit that's not fake.

903
00:51:30.771 --> 00:51:34.580
Like that guy with his monkey face.
Well you know my shits not fake.

904
00:51:34.581 --> 00:51:37.780
So your shit is not.
Say you wouldn't fake anything.
If I was going to,

905
00:51:37.800 --> 00:51:40.610
and I remember I texted you,
said you went,
I'm shooting the big shows,

906
00:51:40.630 --> 00:51:44.000
you want to come up,
I would take you out and I would,
I would,
I'd find this.

907
00:51:44.070 --> 00:51:47.630
I said,
this is where they say all this shit happens.
We'd go,
we sit up,

908
00:51:47.631 --> 00:51:50.030
we shipped by the fire with the case again when we drink and we,

909
00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:52.040
and we keep the fire gone step all night.

910
00:51:52.580 --> 00:51:56.540
And then in the morning it's like that three o'clock in the morning shit was

911
00:51:56.541 --> 00:51:59.600
insane or well that was nothing.

912
00:51:59.610 --> 00:52:03.800
We told a lot of stories and now I'm really tired.
Yeah,
I get it,
man.

913
00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:05.630
I just hate feeling like an asshole.

914
00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:09.270
And if I was out there wandering around looking for bigfoot and I found out,

915
00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:13.520
I put that I of been at home with my kids.
I could have been writing jokes.

916
00:52:13.521 --> 00:52:17.480
I could have been working out,
I could have been,
you know,
doing something smart.

917
00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:20.330
Eh.
How about like survivor man,
myrtle beach or

918
00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:25.940
we're trying to find bikers.

919
00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:30.680
Can we find them survivorman spring break.

920
00:52:30.681 --> 00:52:32.930
I can be like in a bar trying to build shelters at a bar stools.

921
00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:35.960
What is it that we need to find this fucking thing?

922
00:52:36.140 --> 00:52:40.340
Like if you really stop and think about like how amazing killer whales are and

923
00:52:40.341 --> 00:52:42.890
we know that there are real animal that you can go observe.

924
00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:44.970
They speak in this crazy language.

925
00:52:44.980 --> 00:52:48.860
They don't understand that we don't understand.
Rather they have these families,

926
00:52:48.861 --> 00:52:52.760
they stay with these pods for life.
They're very close to each other.

927
00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:54.290
They have different dialects.

928
00:52:54.291 --> 00:52:57.560
They started observing the sounds at one group makes and it's different from the

929
00:52:57.561 --> 00:53:01.610
sounds.
Another group at another part of the world makes it like they're amazing.

930
00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:06.350
Like they're way more fat.
They kill sharks,
man.
They kill dolphins.

931
00:53:06.351 --> 00:53:08.870
They eat dolphins,
like they're ruthless,

932
00:53:08.871 --> 00:53:13.160
but they're also beautiful and they're really fucking smart.

933
00:53:13.190 --> 00:53:15.800
They're really smart.
I get a weird,

934
00:53:15.801 --> 00:53:19.790
crazy way that just doesn't jive with our idea of,
you know,
like,

935
00:53:19.820 --> 00:53:22.130
oh he doesn't know how to play poker.
Fuck them.
You know,

936
00:53:22.131 --> 00:53:25.010
he doesn't know how to drive a car.
He's a pussy.
He's an idiot.
He was.

937
00:53:25.110 --> 00:53:26.010
You have some weird

938
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:30.150
<v 2>crazy life in the ocean intelligence.</v>

939
00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:33.810
They have intelligence where it's applicable in their environment.

940
00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:37.500
They don't need to know how to type.
Okay.
They don't know how to speak Spanish.

941
00:53:37.501 --> 00:53:40.090
They don't have to.
No one Spanish underwater.

942
00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:43.290
They speak dolphin and they speak well.
They know all that shit.
So I,

943
00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:46.910
bigfoot big foot is like,
if it was real,
he's like,
what is he doing?

944
00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:49.680
He's knocking on blood and shit hanging out there,

945
00:53:49.681 --> 00:53:53.550
hiding his shit to hiding his logs.

946
00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:58.830
Melik find bigfoot shit.
He could find bear shit.
You won't find bear bodies.

947
00:53:58.950 --> 00:54:00.630
But if you're telling me you know,
five bear shit,

948
00:54:00.631 --> 00:54:02.940
it's cause you're going to place it doesn't have any bear.
Right.

949
00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:07.710
Where's the big foot shit?
He's burying it,
man.
That's his big trick.

950
00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:12.630
He doesn't save surfers.
He doesn't,
uh,
you know,
kill we've ever seen like,

951
00:54:12.870 --> 00:54:16.590
like a killer whale demonstrate to its young how to kill a seal.

952
00:54:17.010 --> 00:54:20.670
They show them how to kill it.
They get them up on IFE shell I shelves.

953
00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:23.220
They took the,
I know bells and have them slide out,
you know,

954
00:54:23.221 --> 00:54:27.810
big foot's not taking his dog know that he's not.
But we do have any footage.

955
00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:29.190
We have no evidence,

956
00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:33.720
but we have all this evidence of these amazing killer whales that not only that

957
00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:36.180
they're smart as shit and they don't,
we kill them.

958
00:54:36.210 --> 00:54:39.540
They know we killed them and they still talk to us.
They know we killed them.

959
00:54:39.541 --> 00:54:43.350
They have to know by now if they really communicate and they can express,

960
00:54:43.740 --> 00:54:48.740
I mean they might not totally get it or their concept of life and death might be

961
00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:54.120
really weird,
like way different than ours is.
It's,
it's real possible.

962
00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:57.600
But they're so nice to us.
I killed her wheels.
Don't kill people.

963
00:54:57.780 --> 00:54:59.310
They're not attacking surfers.

964
00:54:59.490 --> 00:55:03.270
They're not fighting back because they found out that how they got this thing

965
00:55:03.271 --> 00:55:06.340
and see.
No,
the ones that are in seaworld fight back.
No,
no.

966
00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:07.910
There's been other ones out in the wild.

967
00:55:07.930 --> 00:55:10.860
They don't go attack people has been some rogue stories for sure.

968
00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:12.570
I'll punch up at her,
sees who got,

969
00:55:13.550 --> 00:55:16.890
she got chest bumped by a big fucking killer whale.

970
00:55:17.130 --> 00:55:21.810
Nobody get eaten and nobody came back with no legs.
That it's not what they do.

971
00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:25.650
You know?
And that's an amazing real life animal.

972
00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:28.860
And if we found out the big foot was real and we go,
oh wow.

973
00:55:28.861 --> 00:55:31.200
It's like a big Orangutang but it walks on two legs.

974
00:55:31.530 --> 00:55:36.000
That ain't shit compared to a killer whale.
It's not shit.
It's not shit.

975
00:55:36.360 --> 00:55:40.240
It's a would knock an asshole who hides his shit.
That's what it is.

976
00:55:40.241 --> 00:55:41.071
It's a good point.

977
00:55:41.071 --> 00:55:44.250
What you're basically saying is you're wasting your time up there in the woods.

978
00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:46.260
No where the guy who's wearing a rubber mask.
Okay.

979
00:55:46.340 --> 00:55:49.020
I could be at least half a girl,
big foot,

980
00:55:49.310 --> 00:55:53.190
big foot titties on your season finale and that,
and the Patterson footage.

981
00:55:53.191 --> 00:55:56.260
That's what it is.
A female you haven't seen.
It's so real.
It's got teddy.

982
00:55:56.261 --> 00:56:00.150
Do you not know about?
Um,
big foot come to me like these,

983
00:56:00.151 --> 00:56:04.410
these big foot erotica novels that were published on amazon.com.
Okay.

984
00:56:04.850 --> 00:56:07.510
You come to big foot,
I think it's called come to big foot.

985
00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:08.940
Jamie CV had pulled up.

986
00:56:08.941 --> 00:56:13.941
This title became a huge bestseller apparently in this PC world that we live in,

987
00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:20.780
in this weird world of sanitized language and social justice warriors,

988
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:26.860
there's still women out there that want to get fucked by the biggest monkey.

989
00:56:26.861 --> 00:56:29.860
They can find her fetish,
man big.
It's not a hair fetish.

990
00:56:29.861 --> 00:56:33.790
She saw primate fetish like they want to get gorilla fuck by something that

991
00:56:33.791 --> 00:56:35.320
doesn't even speak their language.

992
00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:39.820
And there's women that are into this idea of Orotic [inaudible] obviously

993
00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.170
totally in the fantasy.

994
00:56:41.171 --> 00:56:42.910
I'm not saying they really want to get fucked by these guys,

995
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:47.160
but I'm saying there,
most of
these men,

996
00:56:47.190 --> 00:56:48.370
these are these things sell.

997
00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:52.690
So there's women that have a fantasy of actually getting fucked by a Sasquatch,

998
00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:57.450
by a giant,
just like just overwhelming.
It just takes you,
ah,

999
00:56:57.610 --> 00:57:00.370
oh that these women have this.

1000
00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:04.600
They actually have a fantasy of getting fucked by something that can't talk to

1001
00:57:04.601 --> 00:57:09.050
them.
It doesn't have any morals.
It doesn't have any ethics.
Oh,
tell me,

1002
00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:10.820
<v 0>come for big fight.</v>

1003
00:57:15.650 --> 00:57:20.240
<v 2>Virginia Wade.
You're awesome.
I love it.
I hope it's,
I hope it's parody.
Um,</v>

1004
00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:24.950
but I hope it's not too,
I hope it's not the stories.
Look,
man,
we don't know.
Look,

1005
00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:28.010
this is shit the guys liked.
The girls can't figure out.

1006
00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:31.100
Why should we be able to figure out that the soon women that really want to get

1007
00:57:31.101 --> 00:57:33.710
fucked by big foot and even if it's only 10 of them,

1008
00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:36.710
what if there's a lot of women that are listening right now?
You fucking asshole.

1009
00:57:36.711 --> 00:57:40.550
You don't understand.
Women.
Women don't want to get fucked.
No listens my friend.

1010
00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:45.240
You don't want I want,
I said,
sweetie,
you don't want to get fucked by bigfoot.

1011
00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:46.950
I'm arguing with a person.
It's not even real.

1012
00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:50.930
You don't want to get fucked by big foot,
but there's women too.

1013
00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:54.230
Or at least they want to read about it.
It might not be.
Look,

1014
00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:59.260
there's some guys that are into dressing like mascots and having sex with other

1015
00:58:00.141 --> 00:58:02.780
men that that's a real thing.
Okay.

1016
00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:05.690
There's some people that are going to be into getting fucked by big foot.

1017
00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:09.710
It's not a bad thank God dammit Mrs. Anderson from Harry and the Hendersons.

1018
00:58:09.890 --> 00:58:12.440
Yeah.
Well look at that.
The thing was living with the family,

1019
00:58:12.500 --> 00:58:14.150
how do you think that thing was going to go down?

1020
00:58:14.570 --> 00:58:17.750
How long is he going to tolerate that guy just banging that check.

1021
00:58:18.050 --> 00:58:20.810
When is someone going to bring in a female big foot to satisfy him?

1022
00:58:20.811 --> 00:58:25.190
Whereas there does the,
do we have rub,
rub maps for a big thing?
Yeah.

1023
00:58:25.310 --> 00:58:28.640
Same thing.
Just No.
Yeah.
If you got to have a big foot,

1024
00:58:28.641 --> 00:58:31.880
you better find a fucking female big foot for him cause otherwise the reason why

1025
00:58:31.881 --> 00:58:34.520
he's come down to the village and she's tired of looking for females.

1026
00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:35.161
<v 0>Hey man,</v>

1027
00:58:35.161 --> 00:58:38.970
you already alluded to the whole native American thing and there are lots of

1028
00:58:38.971 --> 00:58:43.500
stories and native American Lore of the native women being scooped up,

1029
00:58:44.040 --> 00:58:44.460
picked up.

1030
00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:47.190
And then there's a lot of dudes doing admit their chick ran off with another

1031
00:58:47.191 --> 00:58:47.521
dude.

1032
00:58:47.521 --> 00:58:50.510
So they make up some shit about big foot stealing their woman because this is

1033
00:58:50.511 --> 00:58:52.530
the manliest man around like,
oh,

1034
00:58:52.531 --> 00:58:56.260
could she look at my most offensive native American accent?
Oh Gosh.

1035
00:58:56.261 --> 00:59:01.080
She go off with other men.
Must be Sasquatch.
Oh it must be a big foot.

1036
00:59:01.081 --> 00:59:05.010
Come down.
Fuck my woman.
Cause I know man could compete with my hog.

1037
00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:08.870
That's probably what happened.
That's probably some,
excuse me.

1038
00:59:08.890 --> 00:59:13.020
What it sounded like.
It's like a fish story,
you know,
dude,

1039
00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:15.090
I almost,
I had to act the boat.

1040
00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:21.720
It was at least a hundred pounds bigger than the world back exaggerating.

1041
00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:22.100
I had

1042
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:24.050
<v 2>her in my tp.
Yeah,
no seriously.</v>

1043
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:28.290
Big Foot stole her from the tip of my deck,
my,
you know,

1044
00:59:28.550 --> 00:59:32.060
touch her clit and then she shot out like shoes in the matrix.

1045
00:59:32.061 --> 00:59:36.420
Like she was a tight rubber fans.
She went flying through the air.
Only.

1046
00:59:36.430 --> 00:59:39.380
You only you could have taken this to this place.

1047
00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:43.610
It was on this place because this is in this place of fantasy because until

1048
00:59:43.611 --> 00:59:48.170
there's a photo of big foot until there's DNA.
That makes sense.
I had that guy,

1049
00:59:48.171 --> 00:59:52.940
Todd,
this hotel who's a biologist from the,
um,
I think,
uh,
Nyu.

1050
00:59:53.710 --> 00:59:58.130
It's Nyu.
Um,
he's in New York City.
Very,
very brilliant guy.

1051
00:59:58.250 --> 01:00:01.160
And he was also on that spike show where they went with Dean Cain.

1052
01:00:01.161 --> 01:00:04.220
He went looking for bigfoot.
I didn't watch our show.
I can't watch them anymore.

1053
01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:07.880
But talking to that dude,
like,
he's like,
no one's brought in anything man.

1054
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:10.280
There's not one piece of DNA.

1055
01:00:10.281 --> 01:00:13.220
And he explained how all this stuff gets contaminated.

1056
01:00:13.221 --> 01:00:16.430
Like when you have someone pick something up and they put it in the bag and the

1057
01:00:16.431 --> 01:00:19.280
hand to someone,
oh,
it's some sort of human DNA.

1058
01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:23.270
You can't do that because someone touched it.
And when people touch things,

1059
01:00:23.271 --> 01:00:24.740
you leave DNA on shit.

1060
01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:29.660
You know when you're sweaty ass picks up some hairs in the woods and you drop

1061
01:00:29.661 --> 01:00:32.990
them into it,
but you're not supposed to touch that with your body.
If you do,

1062
01:00:32.991 --> 01:00:35.360
you've contaminated it.
You should have rubber gloves on,

1063
01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:39.230
you should have tongs and you should have a direct chain of custody between

1064
01:00:39.231 --> 01:00:42.800
touching that fucking thing and that being in a laboratory and being analyzed.

1065
01:00:42.801 --> 01:00:45.350
And if you don't,
your studies are bullshit.

1066
01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:48.290
And this guy explained this to me in no uncertain terms.

1067
01:00:48.291 --> 01:00:53.090
And when you look at it that way,
you go,
okay,
that means none of it's real.

1068
01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:56.720
Like not no one's found anything.
They've never found a bone.

1069
01:00:56.721 --> 01:01:00.110
They never found a piece of hair.
They'd never found big foot shit.

1070
01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:05.150
They never found one thing that you could say,
this makes big foot a real animal.

1071
01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:10.420
So all you're going on his stories and all you're going on is the knowledge that

1072
01:01:10.551 --> 01:01:14.840
an animal like that used to exist and the knowledge that they found another

1073
01:01:14.841 --> 01:01:19.841
unknown primate and the island of Flores that was only 10,000 plus years ago,

1074
01:01:19.911 --> 01:01:22.520
I think like maybe 13,000 years ago.
It's in that range,

1075
01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:25.760
which is incredibly recent,
like really,
really,

1076
01:01:25.761 --> 01:01:29.090
really recent for a three foot tall little monkey person.

1077
01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:33.740
You know that use tools but had a small brain like you imagine those things for

1078
01:01:33.741 --> 01:01:38.670
one and around today.
Weird Little Freaky fucking half monkey people.
Cool.
Oh,

1079
01:01:38.671 --> 01:01:42.110
it'd be so scary though.
They'd probably steal your baby and eat it.

1080
01:01:42.270 --> 01:01:46.280
It's such a feminist.
A fuck though.
Ooh,
you live fucking,
wouldn't you?
Yes.

1081
01:01:46.310 --> 01:01:50.540
Come for tiny Sasquatch.
Hobbit.
People home for the Orang.
Pendek.

1082
01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:53.690
It doesn't have the same sort of rhyme to,
it doesn't have you read.

1083
01:01:53.691 --> 01:01:57.580
It's called have you ever fucked an animal before you gay?
Easy Dude.
Before what?

1084
01:01:57.670 --> 01:02:02.330
Before you ate it,
you didn't see that the outtakes.
That's not,
listen,

1085
01:02:02.510 --> 01:02:06.200
this is not alone in that woods and they went looking.

1086
01:02:06.590 --> 01:02:10.490
This sounds like a confession is what I'm thinking.
Let's get back to big foot.

1087
01:02:10.790 --> 01:02:11.623
Okay.

1088
01:02:12.410 --> 01:02:15.770
What is the one thing you've done the show or you had your experience outside

1089
01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:17.270
the show and then you went and did the show.

1090
01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:20.070
What is the one thing while were on the show

1091
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:24.050
<v 4>that really gave you pause?
It really made you think we were videotaping?
Uh,</v>

1092
01:02:24.690 --> 01:02:27.510
trigger motion.
Yeah.

1093
01:02:27.511 --> 01:02:30.660
Motion triggered camera had the all set up,

1094
01:02:30.810 --> 01:02:34.350
put bait out like it's a big foot type thing.

1095
01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:40.710
Put Bait out and watched from one clip to the next clip,

1096
01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:45.680
the Bait,
all of it to chocolate bars in an apple in a WildFit,

1097
01:02:45.950 --> 01:02:50.460
a frame field disappear.
Just disappear.

1098
01:02:50.670 --> 01:02:53.910
It's on the show.
I have no answer for that whatsoever.

1099
01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:57.900
A mouse would have said this is a really sensitive half second triggers.

1100
01:02:58.080 --> 01:03:00.930
A mouse would have set that off and beside that had like many,
many feet.

1101
01:03:00.931 --> 01:03:05.530
Can it be paused?
Oh,
I posit in the show because it can it be paused?

1102
01:03:05.531 --> 01:03:10.350
Like could someone walk up to it and shut its operation off momentarily?

1103
01:03:10.590 --> 01:03:14.130
Go over there,
grab a candy bar,
walk out of frame and then turn it back on.

1104
01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:15.660
That's not possible.
No,
it's not possible.

1105
01:03:16.410 --> 01:03:19.080
Why isn't it possible it doesn't work that way or is it I was alone.

1106
01:03:19.081 --> 01:03:23.650
I was on the top of a mountain.
Not,
I'm not saying I'm the top of the I.

1107
01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:25.500
Is it possible in this circumstance?

1108
01:03:25.830 --> 01:03:29.610
Is it possible with the operation of that trail?
Because what happens is no,

1109
01:03:29.611 --> 01:03:34.290
it's not.
Not because to,
to turn the camera off,
right.

1110
01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:38.720
You have to open it up the second you move up here,
you're not being filmed.
Okay.

1111
01:03:39.530 --> 01:03:42.120
I had another scene where a black bear actually came and took my,

1112
01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:46.260
took my camera and it's all on camera.
You see his mouth biting the Lens.

1113
01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:49.650
You see him pull the camera off the tree is,
he's walking.

1114
01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:52.890
You can kind of see the area of his limb just moving as he's walking.

1115
01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:57.150
And a lot of those you can set up to send the data to Wifi.
Right?

1116
01:03:57.450 --> 01:03:58.283
You can't actually.
Yeah.

1117
01:03:58.290 --> 01:04:01.170
And some of them will send you like text messages when they have images.

1118
01:04:01.171 --> 01:04:02.820
When they see something,
they see movement.

1119
01:04:03.070 --> 01:04:06.180
They'll send you a text message that alerts you that you have movement on your

1120
01:04:06.181 --> 01:04:09.450
camera's.
Yeah.
So you didn't get any of those readings,

1121
01:04:09.451 --> 01:04:11.340
but you did get the candy bars disappearing.

1122
01:04:11.490 --> 01:04:14.670
Disappearing to think the bright lights in the sky stole your candy.

1123
01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:18.690
I don't know,
maybe how much,
what did you think happened for real?
For Real.

1124
01:04:18.720 --> 01:04:23.430
I can't,
I haven't got a freaking clue.
Is it infrared camera?
Yes it is.

1125
01:04:24.210 --> 01:04:25.043
It's so,

1126
01:04:25.530 --> 01:04:29.760
it would be a crazy coincidence if the cameras malfunctioned at the exact moment

1127
01:04:29.761 --> 01:04:33.090
that someone came along and stole the candy.
That doesn't,
that's impossible.

1128
01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:35.880
It's impossible.
But is there a way to the top of a mountain,

1129
01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:41.480
but if say some hoaxer dude knew you were going and was slick about it and was

1130
01:04:42.361 --> 01:04:46.860
like real,
like stealthy,
not most likely.
Not Possible.

1131
01:04:46.890 --> 01:04:49.410
Most likely.
But is it possible,

1132
01:04:49.411 --> 01:04:52.650
is there a device that you could use that would freeze the operation of the

1133
01:04:52.651 --> 01:04:53.484
camera?

1134
01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:57.960
Is there some sort of a magnetic field that you could maybe generate something

1135
01:04:57.961 --> 01:05:01.950
powerful that would cause it to disrupt momentarily enough where you could run

1136
01:05:01.951 --> 01:05:06.810
over and grab the candy if you are big foot only if you make fun,
how come?

1137
01:05:06.811 --> 01:05:10.080
Only if your big foot not,
oh,
I didn't say only.
Okay.

1138
01:05:10.260 --> 01:05:14.670
If your big foot I said every big well that means at the end of the show when I

1139
01:05:14.671 --> 01:05:18.180
wrap it up I say,
I don't have an answer for this.
Right.

1140
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:23.170
The skeptics would say everything fell off the branches and out of the field of

1141
01:05:23.171 --> 01:05:26.830
view before the camera could register the falling,

1142
01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:30.400
even though they were stuck on things up.
Right.
Like this and it's infrared.

1143
01:05:30.530 --> 01:05:31.810
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
They were hanging.

1144
01:05:31.811 --> 01:05:35.950
They weren't just sitting down so they were stuck on the guess branches.

1145
01:05:37.330 --> 01:05:40.920
Okay.
Would a camera be sensitive enough to depict a cause?

1146
01:05:40.980 --> 01:05:43.780
You catch that if a candy bar fell off a branch,

1147
01:05:43.781 --> 01:05:47.530
it seems like not a large enough object fell off on its own.

1148
01:05:47.590 --> 01:05:49.630
I think it could potentially fall out of frame.

1149
01:05:49.690 --> 01:05:54.040
The problem is these things were all stuck and lodged.
There was zero wind,

1150
01:05:55.340 --> 01:05:55.691
but yeah,

1151
01:05:55.691 --> 01:05:59.230
but isn't it more likely that gravity pulled them down the ground and the big

1152
01:05:59.231 --> 01:06:04.210
foots and visible and knows how to shut off cameras?
Oh,
does that question,

1153
01:06:04.390 --> 01:06:07.600
what am I a scientist?
Yes,
you are.
Yes.
Is the answer to that.
Yes.

1154
01:06:07.601 --> 01:06:11.590
I need a lab coat that's more like actually who could answer that question more

1155
01:06:11.591 --> 01:06:15.870
likely.
Probably a scientist more like someone who's not.
What do they measure?

1156
01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:18.430
What probability are they measuring?
My likely,

1157
01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:23.110
well the hell knows what's more likely is what we know exists and it's something

1158
01:06:23.111 --> 01:06:23.944
called gravity.

1159
01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:26.770
We know that that's a fair enough thing and we know something's hanging on a

1160
01:06:26.771 --> 01:06:28.450
tree.
Look,
I've set up things,

1161
01:06:28.451 --> 01:06:30.010
think they're going to be there to the end of the time.

1162
01:06:30.110 --> 01:06:33.970
When it came back a week later,
they were gone crazy on things like that happen.

1163
01:06:34.360 --> 01:06:38.620
Gravity always went and that's possible.
Works on tits.
It works on balls.

1164
01:06:38.890 --> 01:06:43.870
It works on candy bars falling off the trees.
Nobody wins.
Gravity always wins.
So,

1165
01:06:44.050 --> 01:06:48.460
and I think that if it's between gravity and an unknown monkey,

1166
01:06:50.910 --> 01:06:52.210
I'm going to go with gravity.

1167
01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:56.680
You watch a show while definitely watch it now you got to see it but sounds

1168
01:06:56.681 --> 01:06:59.260
crazy though.
It's just like dad is crazy,
but that's it.

1169
01:06:59.261 --> 01:07:02.420
That's not just candy bars disappearing.
That's the number one thing I tried it.

1170
01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:04.720
It is possible that you try to recreate.

1171
01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:08.890
Did you like try to set some candy bars up and like put a timelapse on him or

1172
01:07:08.891 --> 01:07:12.850
put the trail cam on them rather and see if you create it and weren't able to

1173
01:07:12.851 --> 01:07:14.650
recreate it because it didn't fall.

1174
01:07:14.740 --> 01:07:19.360
Did you try to make it fall like put it up like real flimsy and then knock them

1175
01:07:19.361 --> 01:07:21.600
down and see if the camera picks it up?
No,

1176
01:07:21.730 --> 01:07:24.850
that's what I would have done because if the camera didn't pick it up,
I go,

1177
01:07:24.851 --> 01:07:28.330
well there it is.
It fell right.
But wasn't there.

1178
01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:32.680
But then again it fell from what I mean it'd be like if I put that there,

1179
01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:36.010
he told me what the odds are of this falling off of this table before tomorrow

1180
01:07:36.011 --> 01:07:40.270
morning.
Well that's different,
but that's not setting it on a stump.
Right.

1181
01:07:40.300 --> 01:07:44.380
Like setting this that the analogy of the comparisons are saying it.

1182
01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:48.220
They were firmly put in places where they wouldn't just fall.
Right.

1183
01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:52.180
So they were put in places where they were hanging,
put in places.
Okay.

1184
01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:55.510
I'm confused.
I thought you were saying they were hanging from a tree,

1185
01:07:56.230 --> 01:07:59.050
which you picked up.
You said hanging?
I never,
I'm sorry.
I was,

1186
01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:01.090
I thought you said they dropped out of frame.

1187
01:08:01.390 --> 01:08:05.110
Which dean w I was thinking there were,
you said they were stuck in place.

1188
01:08:05.350 --> 01:08:09.010
I thought you meant like there was a branch or something like one,
one apple.

1189
01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:13.930
I was like,
like there's the brands stock brands like this.
Okay.
Okay.
So it was,

1190
01:08:13.931 --> 01:08:18.050
but it was stuck inside the branch,
but it was still like hanging in the air.

1191
01:08:18.230 --> 01:08:22.570
Like the branch.
It was the apple was hanging in the air on the ground.

1192
01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:27.110
I would say no to that.
No.
What was it on the ground?
No,
it was 15 feet up.

1193
01:08:27.650 --> 01:08:31.970
Okay.
But in the branch 15 feet up,
I don't want to get bogged down in semantics.

1194
01:08:31.971 --> 01:08:36.830
People go,
what's the point?
Um,
if it was in the air is 15 feet above the ground.

1195
01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:41.090
Right.
And the apple stuck on the branch,
it could conceivably a fallen off.

1196
01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:42.860
It's nothing like being on this table.

1197
01:08:43.190 --> 01:08:48.110
Being on this table is 100% likely that if you put this lighter here in 24

1198
01:08:48.111 --> 01:08:50.040
hours,
as long as we don't have an earthquake,
the lines,

1199
01:08:50.041 --> 01:08:52.370
or at least we'll be splitting hairs,
but I'll give you that.

1200
01:08:52.460 --> 01:08:53.600
That's not splitting hairs at all.

1201
01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:56.870
We're talking about something that could fall from gravity versus something that

1202
01:08:56.871 --> 01:09:01.280
absolutely cannot move unless some interfering force comes along.
No road.
Well,

1203
01:09:01.281 --> 01:09:05.780
the two chocolate,
but ferocious wind and earthquake could chocolate bars?
No,

1204
01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:08.420
this is the same chocolate bars.
We're sitting here in the middle of the table.

1205
01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:12.630
There was,
okay,
so they were stuck on tree branches.

1206
01:09:12.631 --> 01:09:17.210
This bag and the chocolate bar sitting right like that.

1207
01:09:17.250 --> 01:09:20.390
Right.
Nice.
And like not going anywhere.
Okay.

1208
01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:23.330
So for folks who that he's making his hand like about 16 inches,

1209
01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:28.780
Brian's Dick and inside as take a pen,
which is my dick,

1210
01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:32.150
small black.
It's of happy Dick.
No,

1211
01:09:32.830 --> 01:09:36.410
it's nothing to brag about.
Um,
so okay,

1212
01:09:36.530 --> 01:09:41.220
so that little tiny baby dick in between the both space,
that's where you,
uh,

1213
01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:43.080
that's where you dropped a candy bar.
Right?

1214
01:09:43.090 --> 01:09:46.430
And so the apple stuck in a tree but 15 feet off the ground.

1215
01:09:46.970 --> 01:09:51.800
And then the candy bars,
candy bars.
Now what parts of the carer anymore?
Anyway,

1216
01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:56.490
I do.
I live in America or we were free with as candy does.

1217
01:09:56.830 --> 01:10:00.570
Are they called?
Yeah,
exactly.
I Dunno.
Chocolate,
chocolate.
Hell,

1218
01:10:00.571 --> 01:10:03.990
it's a Kansas trying to confuse us man.
We got him on the run here.

1219
01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.620
It was dry out really fast.
If you ever let an apple out,

1220
01:10:06.621 --> 01:10:07.580
like if it has a little key,

1221
01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:12.640
it turns Brown logic and your science just stop [inaudible] sound this mysticism

1222
01:10:14.451 --> 01:10:18.440
to be uncovered here now.
Um,
the candy bars,

1223
01:10:18.710 --> 01:10:22.580
you left them on the log.
So the candy bar is represented by the baby Dick.
Right.

1224
01:10:23.090 --> 01:10:26.480
And uh,
so this,
this is flat.
It's sitting on a flat surface.

1225
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:29.480
What it kind of an area we're looking at,

1226
01:10:29.481 --> 01:10:31.940
we're looking at like a heavily wooded area.
Is that what it's like?

1227
01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:34.840
Top of the mountain?
Sparse trees,
rocks,
uh,

1228
01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:38.670
rodents got road and sometimes for sure.
Right.
Um,

1229
01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:42.380
wouldn't it be likely that maybe a road and is small enough that it could grab

1230
01:10:42.381 --> 01:10:43.280
that candy bar?

1231
01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:47.240
And maybe the trail cameras set up for like game probably set up for something

1232
01:10:47.241 --> 01:10:50.030
that triggers it's it's camera sensors.
No,
in fact it,

1233
01:10:50.031 --> 01:10:53.360
we showed it with the testing that it actually triggers with dust in the air.

1234
01:10:54.790 --> 01:10:58.530
Just always be on,
oh,
this testing

1235
01:11:00.380 --> 01:11:01.730
things,
dust.

1236
01:11:02.010 --> 01:11:05.450
You remember those scenes and twilight where the sunlight is cutting through the

1237
01:11:05.451 --> 01:11:07.760
trees and you see all the dust in the air,

1238
01:11:07.761 --> 01:11:10.130
all the glistening stuff and shit and birds.

1239
01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:15.360
So it'd be a constant like flash.
It'd be like a movie basically.

1240
01:11:15.361 --> 01:11:17.080
And that's what happened.
It was constantly,

1241
01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:21.360
you could run it together like stop animation.
There's just nothing would stop,

1242
01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:26.030
would keep moving.
So good pickup dust.
All right,
so the bold,
my growing up,

1243
01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:27.520
I know where you're going with this like no,
no,

1244
01:11:27.550 --> 01:11:31.080
I agree with my theory is the road that theory does the only one that makes

1245
01:11:31.081 --> 01:11:35.730
sense to me,
unless a big foot can fuck with cameras and make them stop.

1246
01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:39.900
Is that what you were implying?
That's what I was implying.
It really for real,

1247
01:11:40.230 --> 01:11:43.080
for real.
I was implying I didn't say it.
That's what it was.

1248
01:11:43.170 --> 01:11:47.580
But you will implying the possibility.
You will put that in your what if folder.

1249
01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:51.090
What if because that

1250
01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:55.320
that's what this better be good.

1251
01:11:57.310 --> 01:12:01.290
It's aliens.
I'm not even,
I'm sorry.
I'm not telling you.
Come on.

1252
01:12:01.291 --> 01:12:04.500
We got to joke around with drinking and we have a little Guinness,

1253
01:12:04.501 --> 01:12:08.120
a little marijuana.
We're talking big foot.
You can't take this seriously.
Sorry.

1254
01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:09.953
Um,

1255
01:12:10.290 --> 01:12:15.290
so if it is possible that this animal exhibits some strange power over

1256
01:12:18.211 --> 01:12:20.700
electronics like that would,
that would

1257
01:12:23.150 --> 01:12:25.800
explain a lot of things,
right?
Who explained a lot of shit?

1258
01:12:25.801 --> 01:12:29.220
Like how come there's no pictures of bigfoot?
Funny thing.
Funny thing,

1259
01:12:29.550 --> 01:12:32.640
we found out that it knows how to stop cameras.

1260
01:12:32.790 --> 01:12:35.520
It's smart enough to figure out how to stop cameras.

1261
01:12:35.521 --> 01:12:37.820
Not Smart enough or pants or shoes or any cool shit.

1262
01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:41.640
No cell phones driving a car.
Nope,
no big foot TV.

1263
01:12:42.540 --> 01:12:45.090
But they figured out how to stop cameras cause a,

1264
01:12:45.130 --> 01:12:49.110
that fucking camera is a problem.
Soon as man invented the camera,

1265
01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:53.640
they saw it and were like,
we gotta we gotta figure it out and we got a screech.

1266
01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:56.190
It's the Howells Howell's killer camera.

1267
01:12:58.770 --> 01:13:02.720
Did you do the how?
That was a big,
of course they do the hoop,
the,

1268
01:13:03.030 --> 01:13:05.100
does anybody know what it sounds like?
That's what I said.

1269
01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:07.830
I didn't even know what you're saying.
It'd be like pissing and he'd say,
Oh man,

1270
01:13:07.831 --> 01:13:09.930
dude,
you guys are ugly.
You don't know what you're saying.

1271
01:13:10.210 --> 01:13:13.590
You call him for some Dick.
That's the worst.
When you get there.

1272
01:13:13.591 --> 01:13:17.440
He thinks you're a dick.
Tease just beats the shit out of you.
Oh,
horny.

1273
01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:21.840
Bigfoot wasting his time.
It's like you don't want to be a fake bigfoot Tinder.

1274
01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:26.170
You know what I'm saying?
Tinder big foot pick.
Yeah.
That's what they use.

1275
01:13:26.190 --> 01:13:28.290
10 kids today.
The kids today,

1276
01:13:28.770 --> 01:13:32.910
they felt could just be people from the future fucking with us.
Easily.

1277
01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:38.250
Easily.
Much more likely than bigfoot.
I think time travel,
it's more believable.

1278
01:13:38.740 --> 01:13:42.090
What's more believable is the aliens went back in time,

1279
01:13:42.091 --> 01:13:46.080
grabbed the gigantic tow Pythagoras and just drop it off periodically in the

1280
01:13:46.081 --> 01:13:47.190
woods to fuck with people.

1281
01:13:47.550 --> 01:13:52.080
That's more likely than a large more than tigers.

1282
01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:55.350
Population of gigantic Pythia start running through the woods.

1283
01:13:55.351 --> 01:13:58.800
You're going to love this one.
It gets even better.
Another.
On another occasion.

1284
01:13:58.830 --> 01:14:02.340
It was all about the potential of it being the nephron from the Bible.

1285
01:14:02.341 --> 01:14:07.230
Genesis chapter six
number the chapters.

1286
01:14:07.231 --> 01:14:12.010
It gives a lot of credence to words.
It sounds authoritative.
So there you go.

1287
01:14:12.160 --> 01:14:17.160
<v 2>That's the stuff you start hearing and seeing over and over and over again.</v>

1288
01:14:17.260 --> 01:14:19.090
It's bizarre.
It's a,
it's a slippery slope.

1289
01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:22.690
Is there easily could have been large people at one point in time?
I mean,

1290
01:14:22.691 --> 01:14:26.140
there's large people today.
The idea that this has never happened before.

1291
01:14:26.141 --> 01:14:29.200
You never had Shaquille O'Neal's before.
You never had that guy from China,

1292
01:14:29.201 --> 01:14:33.520
which isn't what's the guy's named gigantic,
gigantic basketball player.

1293
01:14:34.050 --> 01:14:38.530
Yeah,
man.
Thank you.
As a giant.
He's so fucking tall.

1294
01:14:38.531 --> 01:14:41.770
He's taller than Shaquille O'Neal and like seven ten seven 11 or something.

1295
01:14:42.010 --> 01:14:45.760
How tall was he,
Jamie?
Seven seven.
What the fuck?

1296
01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:47.320
So that guy exists today.

1297
01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:50.690
It's very likely that at one point in time in history there,

1298
01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:53.560
there was a batch of those people.
There's a lot of them.
It's souls.

1299
01:14:53.710 --> 01:14:58.180
So possible we very aligned and we're not genetically that much different than

1300
01:14:58.181 --> 01:15:02.140
people that live 50,000 plus years ago.
So you're talking about the Bible,

1301
01:15:02.141 --> 01:15:07.141
which was maybe written somewhere around like four or 5,000 years ago,

1302
01:15:07.481 --> 01:15:10.270
and I think the Dead Sea Scrolls,
I think they got that to like,

1303
01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:13.560
it was not like 5,000 years,
whatever it is.
So it's anyway,

1304
01:15:13.561 --> 01:15:15.820
it's between like what did we have today,

1305
01:15:15.821 --> 01:15:18.850
2015 and the last like whatever thousand years.

1306
01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:24.100
It's super possible that there was a group of huge fucking Yao Mings running

1307
01:15:24.101 --> 01:15:28.720
around back then.
Totally possible.
That's the same genes.
I mean the v they,

1308
01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:31.570
they probably have more access to protein and food today,

1309
01:15:31.571 --> 01:15:34.060
but if they lived in a really rich source like this,

1310
01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:37.600
you know as well as anybody that any bear that lives in an area where there's a

1311
01:15:37.601 --> 01:15:40.660
lot of salmon.
Look how tall that guy is.
Oh my God.

1312
01:15:40.780 --> 01:15:42.310
Who is that guy is the newest giant.

1313
01:15:42.311 --> 01:15:46.810
He's 75 he's a college player now mama do Mgi or something.
I'm like,

1314
01:15:46.811 --> 01:15:51.730
oh my God,
he's still growing.
Yeah,
he's only like 19 guys fucking Christ.

1315
01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:56.680
Now imagine if you're as short as me.
I'm five eight and I stumbled through it.

1316
01:15:56.681 --> 01:16:01.330
And by the way,
back in like the civil war days,
those guys were smaller than me.

1317
01:16:01.540 --> 01:16:02.560
Those guys were tiny.

1318
01:16:02.620 --> 01:16:07.620
Let's say the average size of a grown man in the civil war was like 135 pounds.

1319
01:16:08.710 --> 01:16:11.260
They were these tiny little people that didn't get a lot of food.

1320
01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:14.080
Voyagers are the same.
They used to carry like a hundred pounds on her back.

1321
01:16:14.350 --> 01:16:16.570
And if you found a guy like this,

1322
01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:20.170
if you went to some place and you saw people like this and you got an a boat and

1323
01:16:20.171 --> 01:16:22.540
sailed across the sea,
and the land is on an island,

1324
01:16:22.541 --> 01:16:26.470
it was filled with legit giants.
Goddamn,
you'd have some stories.

1325
01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:29.380
I think that makes more sense.
A big foot.

1326
01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:33.070
The nephilim.

1327
01:16:34.750 --> 01:16:37.570
So the best thing you saw was nothing.

1328
01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:42.260
The best thing you saw was shit disappearing.
Best thing I saw.
Yeah,

1329
01:16:42.261 --> 01:16:45.460
it was shit disappearing.
Shit does pay.
But what about sounds?

1330
01:16:45.461 --> 01:16:50.460
Did you hear anything?
Did you hear any moans or I need grunts before the odd,

1331
01:16:50.490 --> 01:16:55.130
you know,
but what the hell is that?
That could be a bird,
right?

1332
01:16:55.131 --> 01:16:59.190
Your gravy.
A Raven frog.
It could be fraud.
It could be Amazon.

1333
01:16:59.230 --> 01:17:03.120
Whoop frogs make a lot of crazy noises.
They whoop now.

1334
01:17:03.121 --> 01:17:04.280
They make it sound like that for sure.

1335
01:17:04.281 --> 01:17:07.450
And he scream or what was the sound that you heard when you were in your tent?

1336
01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:10.070
You heard a Sasquatch.
Would you say you're talking about

1337
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:13.430
<v 0>the survivor man in Alaska show?
Yes.
What does the side,
what does it sound like?</v>

1338
01:17:13.431 --> 01:17:16.790
Well,
first of all,
picture the scene.
I'm,
I'm,
I'm there.
Let me take my pants off.

1339
01:17:16.850 --> 01:17:21.250
Middle of nowhere.
Sorry.
Hang on.
Do you like this?

1340
01:17:21.251 --> 01:17:25.040
Should be some hand cream over that.
I don't need that shit.
I'll dry jack on.

1341
01:17:25.041 --> 01:17:29.030
My man won't be dependent on lotion like some pussy.
It took them.

1342
01:17:29.031 --> 01:17:31.360
I don't take painted like a bus.
Let's second.

1343
01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:34.880
They just go down like down the hill.
It's got way better.

1344
01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:40.310
Okay.
Sorry.
So picture of scene.
Middle of nowhere.

1345
01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:45.970
Laska and coast by myself.
What do I smell like?
Lavender.

1346
01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:51.950
Sorry.
Okay.
Middle of nowhere.
Alaska coast.
I'm sorry.

1347
01:17:51.951 --> 01:17:55.220
I want it to feel I'm filming a scene.
Survive man.
Seen,
blah,
blah,
blah.

1348
01:17:55.230 --> 01:17:59.180
Just begun to grasp at or something.
And then all of a sudden night,
the trees,

1349
01:17:59.330 --> 01:18:04.130
50 yards away at about 10 foot,
12 foot height.

1350
01:18:04.131 --> 01:18:08.570
Just start like shaking,
just going crazy.
And then I hear a great day.

1351
01:18:08.970 --> 01:18:12.170
<v 6>Ooh,
Ooh.</v>

1352
01:18:12.540 --> 01:18:16.140
<v 0>Like that.
Only way,
way,
way,
way,
way louder.</v>

1353
01:18:16.890 --> 01:18:20.250
Deeper.
Right.
Goes right through your body when it's done.

1354
01:18:20.820 --> 01:18:23.560
The problem is I'm in Alaska,
so unless there's an escaped,

1355
01:18:23.561 --> 01:18:27.510
great eight from the zoo.
What Dal is that?
Cause bears don't do that.

1356
01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:31.470
The skeptics would say that the bear you just ran across a bear that made some

1357
01:18:31.471 --> 01:18:35.070
unusual noises five times in a row and then when he left five times in a row,

1358
01:18:35.071 --> 01:18:36.600
five times in a row and then when he left,

1359
01:18:36.810 --> 01:18:41.780
the whole forest just erupted with breaking trees as it ran away.

1360
01:18:42.990 --> 01:18:47.070
I don't know.
I don't know many bears that do that.
Hence my question.

1361
01:18:47.490 --> 01:18:50.910
What was that wish I knew these people think it's big foot.

1362
01:18:51.090 --> 01:18:54.150
I'm going to go find it.
Indian rave.
No,

1363
01:18:54.151 --> 01:18:58.820
there's no way whatsoever that you were asleep before this happened.
Oh,

1364
01:18:58.890 --> 01:19:02.310
it was two o'clock in the afternoon.
Two o'clock in the afternoon roughly.

1365
01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:04.110
Just so you had more than one experience,
right.

1366
01:19:04.111 --> 01:19:07.020
Cause there was another one when you went for your camera and it ran off.
Right.

1367
01:19:07.180 --> 01:19:09.750
Dow that was that one.
That was just that.
We know what that was at night.

1368
01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:14.100
Did I screw it up?
I'm going to screw it up mid day.
Mid Day.
Okay.
So when,

1369
01:19:14.130 --> 01:19:17.750
when you,
you didn't see anything,
you just heard it as,
see it hurts.

1370
01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:22.050
To this day I haven't seen anything until I can't claim anything.

1371
01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:25.620
I haven't seen it.
That's why I keep saying to show it to him.

1372
01:19:25.710 --> 01:19:28.050
He said so a fucked up thing about people telling you stories.

1373
01:19:28.350 --> 01:19:30.810
I had it in my head that this was a story at nighttime.

1374
01:19:30.870 --> 01:19:34.470
I had it in my head that you were in your tent and then this thing came out at

1375
01:19:34.471 --> 01:19:37.800
nighttime and made all this noise and then you went for your camera and ran off

1376
01:19:37.801 --> 01:19:40.510
until you,
you know,
you want it to be more like that.
Yeah.
I want it to be smooth.

1377
01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:45.240
I didn't have a tent.
It's nighttime scares me and it was midday.
No tent mid day.

1378
01:19:45.270 --> 01:19:47.380
Yeah.
It was just,
it was the survivor man thing.

1379
01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:51.120
If you haven't seen something where you're like,
that might be big foot,

1380
01:19:51.150 --> 01:19:54.270
never seen anything.
Nope.
Nothing.
Nope.
Nope.

1381
01:19:54.660 --> 01:19:57.210
It's why I want to know finding schizophrenia.

1382
01:19:58.710 --> 01:20:02.040
I don't think it's schizophrenia.
I don't think it's schizophrenia.

1383
01:20:02.190 --> 01:20:06.780
I think here's a,
here's a problem.
Heightened states.

1384
01:20:06.990 --> 01:20:08.280
Okay.
Heightened

1385
01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:09.900
<v 2>states of fear,</v>

1386
01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:13.290
heightened states of a alien nation,

1387
01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:17.250
unusual states of the mind,
which uh,

1388
01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:22.280
would definitely coincide with being alone in Alaska by yourself with like a

1389
01:20:25.021 --> 01:20:29.760
fucking bottle opener and a roll of duct tape and a condom.

1390
01:20:29.761 --> 01:20:31.980
I mean that's what you have when you go to these fucking places.

1391
01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:36.510
You go and you bring like a bag of shit that you might ordinarily have on you if

1392
01:20:36.511 --> 01:20:39.420
something went horribly wrong and you found yourself in these places and then

1393
01:20:39.421 --> 01:20:43.560
you figure out a way to survive.
That's a heightened state,
right?

1394
01:20:43.590 --> 01:20:47.880
So anything that happens is going to be suspect.
Yeah.

1395
01:20:47.881 --> 01:20:50.520
There was some stuff going on in your brain,
man.

1396
01:20:50.700 --> 01:20:55.700
Your brain is protecting you from all sorts of weird possibilities.

1397
01:20:56.250 --> 01:20:57.810
Bears and predators.

1398
01:20:57.900 --> 01:21:02.900
Who knows the fuckers out there and people fucking person the middle of nowhere

1399
01:21:03.541 --> 01:21:07.380
like that.
That's,
that might be the most dangerous shit you come across.
Yeah.

1400
01:21:07.570 --> 01:21:11.700
That's Timothy Mcveigh running cross big mother fucker out there and it was some

1401
01:21:11.701 --> 01:21:15.900
crazy unibomber Ted Kaczynski type character.
That's scarier than the tiles.

1402
01:21:15.930 --> 01:21:19.680
Way Scarier than the Tigers.
A guy living by himself.
If you went in deep,
deep,

1403
01:21:19.681 --> 01:21:20.191
deep,
deep,

1404
01:21:20.191 --> 01:21:24.310
deep into the woods like miles and miles and hours and hours of hiking and you

1405
01:21:24.311 --> 01:21:28.950
found a cabin,
you better not knock on that fucking door.
You just better not.

1406
01:21:28.980 --> 01:21:33.930
Who's this guy?
Why is he out here with no one around him?
That guy is crazy.

1407
01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:36.900
You don't,
that might be the scariest thing you could ever find in the woods.

1408
01:21:37.080 --> 01:21:39.690
A person who lives in the woods.
Yeah,
I totally agree.

1409
01:21:39.810 --> 01:21:43.230
I've always said that people go on about the romanticism of some dude living out

1410
01:21:43.231 --> 01:21:46.380
in the Bush by himself for 35 years.
It was like,
he's nuts.

1411
01:21:47.130 --> 01:21:49.710
Guy's an asshole.
Guaranteed.

1412
01:21:50.290 --> 01:21:53.490
It's going to live where there's no people.
Why an asshole?

1413
01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:58.260
People are my favorite thing.
I love people.
Why would you live with is no people.

1414
01:21:58.470 --> 01:22:02.940
What kind of a foot square piece of shit wants to live in a bloodshed in the

1415
01:22:02.941 --> 01:22:05.700
middle of nowhere.
Somebody wants to blow everybody up.

1416
01:22:05.940 --> 01:22:08.590
It's like that Ted Kaczynski guy.
That's how he lived it.

1417
01:22:08.620 --> 01:22:12.180
Guy Was a professor at Berkeley decided to just move to the woods.

1418
01:22:12.181 --> 01:22:15.840
That was his house.
Look at that.
That's scary.
Fuck yeah,
man.

1419
01:22:16.090 --> 01:22:17.760
If you see that thing,
light it on fire,

1420
01:22:17.930 --> 01:22:21.630
it's scary to take your chances to take a chance of escaping from the flames.

1421
01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:26.910
Light that house on fire.
Fuck,
that guy.
Looks like Ohio,
by the way.

1422
01:22:26.911 --> 01:22:27.744
I don't mean that.

1423
01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:31.290
If you listen to his podcasts right now in a tiny little shed in the middle of

1424
01:22:31.291 --> 01:22:34.380
nowhere,
this has always been my dream,
man.
You're shitting on my dream.

1425
01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:38.810
I don't really mean that.
I'm just talking really relaxed,
sweet,

1426
01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:40.350
backpedal going on there,
but it's true.

1427
01:22:40.351 --> 01:22:42.340
If you do live in the woods like that you,

1428
01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:46.380
there's a high possibility that you might be fucking crazy or hiding from the

1429
01:22:46.381 --> 01:22:50.010
law or hiding from the wall when you see people but out there for a lot,

1430
01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:55.050
even if they didn't start out crazy,
you go bush right now.
Tell me this.

1431
01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:58.560
Do you take that in consideration when you think about this experience like

1432
01:22:58.561 --> 01:23:00.750
you're like,
man,
did I fucked this up in my head?

1433
01:23:01.050 --> 01:23:04.770
Did I have no reference point because I was alone for too long out there and did

1434
01:23:04.771 --> 01:23:06.100
I just give myself some

1435
01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:07.840
<v 4>sort of a jolt,</v>

1436
01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:12.460
like an extra emotional charge to my memory that may have distorted it and as I

1437
01:23:12.461 --> 01:23:15.460
repeated it over and over again in my memory,

1438
01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:19.630
I might have twisted it a little bit and jumped it up or move to the side to

1439
01:23:19.631 --> 01:23:23.590
side or you rock solid that that's exactly what happened.

1440
01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:28.180
Absolutely.
Option one,
I haven't got a freaking clue.
I could have been messed up.

1441
01:23:28.930 --> 01:23:30.010
Absolutely agree with you.

1442
01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:32.830
I question all of those experiences and having him out there.

1443
01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:35.620
That was a very honest of you.
That's very honest of you.

1444
01:23:35.830 --> 01:23:37.990
I think that was a raven.
I think that was a squirrel.

1445
01:23:38.410 --> 01:23:39.940
That's a track I can't account for.

1446
01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:42.010
Those branches are just broken because the snow load,

1447
01:23:42.310 --> 01:23:45.050
these ones aren't broken because of snow load.
Just like I don't,

1448
01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:48.400
I haven't freaking clue.
I can be just mumbling.
But at the end,

1449
01:23:48.401 --> 01:23:51.280
that was probably a freaky experience.

1450
01:23:51.430 --> 01:23:56.110
But was that it's freaky as being above the tiger.
What was more freaky?

1451
01:23:56.380 --> 01:24:00.320
Being above the tire.
Yeah,
I would imagine.
Right.
Because this is real.
This is,

1452
01:24:00.370 --> 01:24:04.150
you know,
it's,
as long as it says it's there,
it is confirmed animal.
Yeah.

1453
01:24:04.330 --> 01:24:07.450
Confirmed kills people.
Yeah.
I was gonna say earlier at that place,

1454
01:24:07.451 --> 01:24:11.950
the sooner bands,
they've killed 300,000 people in the last 200 years.

1455
01:24:12.460 --> 01:24:16.840
Tigers were responsible for 300,000 confirmed deaths.
That's insane.

1456
01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:21.430
That is a crazy number.
Like you,
you,
you,
you researched it.

1457
01:24:21.431 --> 01:24:25.990
I listened to that in a documentary and then like,
that can't be true.

1458
01:24:26.260 --> 01:24:29.590
So then I went and I googled all these different sources and that's essentially

1459
01:24:29.591 --> 01:24:31.090
the number.
Somewhere around there,

1460
01:24:31.091 --> 01:24:36.091
somewhere between two and 300,000 that's fucking insane,

1461
01:24:36.191 --> 01:24:40.300
man.
That's insane.
Even if it's like,
okay,
200 years,

1462
01:24:40.301 --> 01:24:45.301
even as 200,000 think about how many fucking people that their kid jack by

1463
01:24:47.851 --> 01:24:51.810
tigers.
That's a fucking pile of people,
man.

1464
01:24:52.050 --> 01:24:56.010
If y'all a pile of 200,000 people,
oh my God,

1465
01:24:56.011 --> 01:24:59.310
that's terrifying.
That's a thousand a year.

1466
01:24:59.870 --> 01:25:04.560
It's hippos.
That's three a day.
Water Buffalo two,
that's three a day,

1467
01:25:04.650 --> 01:25:08.080
right?
1,000 a year.

1468
01:25:08.110 --> 01:25:11.710
It's like three a day or close to it in that neighborhood.
Two to three a day.

1469
01:25:12.010 --> 01:25:15.880
Every fucking day for 200 years.
Oh my God.

1470
01:25:16.660 --> 01:25:21.250
Oh my God.
Like fuck the wolf man.
You know.

1471
01:25:21.670 --> 01:25:24.610
Fuck big foot tigers.

1472
01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:29.590
That's real.
What a crazy animal man.

1473
01:25:29.710 --> 01:25:33.280
And we're like working really hard to make sure they stay alive so they can keep

1474
01:25:33.281 --> 01:25:37.000
eating those Indians.
Fuck man.

1475
01:25:37.030 --> 01:25:39.130
Indians have to be the nicest people ever.

1476
01:25:39.970 --> 01:25:42.940
They know the tigers are gonna eat them and they still want to make sure their

1477
01:25:42.941 --> 01:25:43.870
populations healthy.

1478
01:25:45.410 --> 01:25:46.243
<v 7>Wow.</v>

1479
01:25:46.950 --> 01:25:49.110
<v 4>It must be the nicest people I've met.
Really Nice people.</v>

1480
01:25:49.350 --> 01:25:51.720
They must be ones I know.
Yeah,
I mean it only,

1481
01:25:51.780 --> 01:25:55.470
that's the only way that actually fought very hard to make sure that the tigers

1482
01:25:55.471 --> 01:25:58.980
are kept very safe and that's why they works up.
That's amazing.

1483
01:25:59.010 --> 01:26:02.070
Is that why they worship cows and the cows like walk around the streets so that

1484
01:26:02.071 --> 01:26:04.050
they are like bait?
I couldn't figure out that.

1485
01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:06.890
<v 2>That's actually smart.</v>

1486
01:26:07.650 --> 01:26:11.650
Mark Hauser ways you to get them people with guns good away from me.

1487
01:26:12.930 --> 01:26:14.640
The whole thing is bananas.
The the,

1488
01:26:14.641 --> 01:26:17.990
the fact that they starve but they won't eat the cows and then the fact that

1489
01:26:17.991 --> 01:26:22.100
they want the,
how did they develop this unusual over there,

1490
01:26:23.290 --> 01:26:23.590
Joe.

1491
01:26:23.590 --> 01:26:28.430
Not Pot grows in profuse amounts all over the roads.

1492
01:26:28.640 --> 01:26:31.880
Everywhere you can get it down the street.
His store,
they weigh it for you.

1493
01:26:31.881 --> 01:26:34.360
They mentioned it.
You don't have to go to fucking luck.

1494
01:26:34.730 --> 01:26:37.790
I'm talking about you pull up a new driveway and on either side of your
driveway.

1495
01:26:37.791 --> 01:26:39.080
It's like a field of hotspots.

1496
01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:43.250
Bizarre need to grow it indoors and I can't get rid of it.

1497
01:26:43.280 --> 01:26:46.610
I'm trying to hand it out to people.
Quarter last week.
Jesus Christ.

1498
01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:51.020
You don't need pot to be growing everywhere and come to India.
Avoid Nick Tigers,

1499
01:26:51.021 --> 01:26:55.610
but stay for the weed everywhere.
Man.
This is California.

1500
01:26:56.920 --> 01:27:01.280
Nia for weed.
That's ridiculous.
That's a poor plan.

1501
01:27:02.330 --> 01:27:05.900
Go for the people.
That makes sense.
I would like to go just to treat.

1502
01:27:06.050 --> 01:27:08.550
I would really love to experience like what?

1503
01:27:08.580 --> 01:27:12.380
What it's like to talk to a real guru.
I know goof on a lot of those dudes,

1504
01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:17.210
those Yogis and those.
What's a real guru?
I don't know man.

1505
01:27:17.470 --> 01:27:21.530
I think like all things,
there's got to be someone that's doing it right.

1506
01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:26.620
It's probably insanely difficult to be like a real Yogi.

1507
01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:30.200
Like a real master who's really like a sod.

1508
01:27:30.201 --> 01:27:35.201
Do some dude who just smokes hash all day and meditates and goes into poses with

1509
01:27:35.571 --> 01:27:39.110
Assad.
Do an Indian laughs.
Yeah,
well that's what they do,
right?
It was intense.

1510
01:27:39.111 --> 01:27:43.790
It was wet and I would like to talk to a one of those real dudes who's really

1511
01:27:43.791 --> 01:27:47.000
out there doing it and he's not doing publicity tours,
are trying to sell books.

1512
01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:51.410
He doesn't have a podcast.
He's just out there smoking hash and stretching.

1513
01:27:51.470 --> 01:27:54.440
So what do you,
what do you think of what that guy has living off?
Nothing.

1514
01:27:54.590 --> 01:27:58.310
No food.
No water.
It's bullshit.
100% okay.

1515
01:27:58.390 --> 01:28:01.700
This is a bullshit artist.
That guy's nuts.
That's why you know about them.

1516
01:28:01.970 --> 01:28:04.290
The reason why you know about him,
he's just telling me I don't do it.

1517
01:28:04.400 --> 01:28:09.110
I don't drink.
I just take into [inaudible].
Fuck Outta here.
Shut up.

1518
01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:13.400
I went to this guy's house,
when's this guy's office to film?

1519
01:28:13.401 --> 01:28:16.420
An episode of the Scifi show.
And as I walked in that this,

1520
01:28:16.430 --> 01:28:19.610
the thing that he supposedly could do turned out to be bullshit.

1521
01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:22.640
But as we walked in and he has this picture of,

1522
01:28:22.641 --> 01:28:27.641
this Indian guy is a man from India and he has white paint all over his face and

1523
01:28:27.831 --> 01:28:29.990
he has no shirt on.
He was like this weird dress.

1524
01:28:30.230 --> 01:28:33.500
He's wearing these weird clothes.
He's dressed in and a,
I say,

1525
01:28:33.501 --> 01:28:34.730
who's that guy goes,
oh,

1526
01:28:34.731 --> 01:28:38.930
well he is actually achieved the highest state of enlightenment and he has

1527
01:28:38.931 --> 01:28:43.760
existed without water or food for the past 13 years.
I go,
no,

1528
01:28:43.761 --> 01:28:48.200
he hasn't.
No,
he hasn't.
Why is he fat?
He's,
he's still fat,

1529
01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:51.440
he's still fat.
He doesn't eat,
and he just didn't get the fuck Outta here,
man.

1530
01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:53.810
And then I was like,
well,
I can't believe I'm at this guy's office.

1531
01:28:53.811 --> 01:28:56.060
I'm going to listen to some bullshit thing.

1532
01:28:56.180 --> 01:28:59.930
You can't say a guy has lived without food for 13 years.

1533
01:29:00.050 --> 01:29:02.490
Put that motherfucker in one of those David Blaine

1534
01:29:02.490 --> 01:29:06.870
<v 4>boxes and let's watch him.
Yeah.
What's,
watch him for a few years.
Come on,</v>

1535
01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:09.270
let me see how long it takes for you.
Starve to death.

1536
01:29:09.660 --> 01:29:12.420
You fuckhead the chances to say that

1537
01:29:12.930 --> 01:29:16.310
<v 1>the gories you ever read about the Horace?
What does that in India,
these are the,</v>

1538
01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:21.400
the high enlightened next level from Sadie sort of thing.

1539
01:29:21.930 --> 01:29:25.830
And they,
they live off eating the dead people that are in the guns,

1540
01:29:25.890 --> 01:29:30.240
Ganga Ganga River.
Oh my God.
They,
they'll go down and they'll dealt eat.

1541
01:29:30.241 --> 01:29:34.480
The body's just Google a gory and Google Aghori a and a,

1542
01:29:34.770 --> 01:29:39.410
a,
G,
a,
g,
H,
O,
r,
I think.
And,
and,

1543
01:29:39.710 --> 01:29:44.430
and they,
they practice necrophilia.
Oh my God.
Yeah,
they fucked the dead bodies.

1544
01:29:44.431 --> 01:29:45.510
He do.
Oh.

1545
01:29:45.540 --> 01:29:48.580
And this is part of all the sorts of states of enlightenment there in the eat

1546
01:29:48.690 --> 01:29:51.840
excrement they eat,
they'll drink gear in it.
You just live this way.

1547
01:29:51.841 --> 01:29:55.650
They or the rule of thumb is accept the unacceptable.

1548
01:29:56.400 --> 01:29:57.190
Wow.

1549
01:29:57.190 --> 01:30:01.890
<v 4>It's insane to they're there right now.
Ooze and yeah.</v>

1550
01:30:01.891 --> 01:30:04.290
Well it's all about connecting with Shiva and if you do this,

1551
01:30:04.291 --> 01:30:07.530
you're denying self and blah,
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.
But it's intense.

1552
01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:12.150
Hannibal monks of Vera and Nasa,
Nasa Indian tribe.

1553
01:30:12.151 --> 01:30:15.570
It's a freaking place to go.
Let's drink from skulls and live among the dead.

1554
01:30:16.290 --> 01:30:19.530
Not like fun headlines.

1555
01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:23.310
They do it like God there and they did it.
Did you encounter these people?
Uh,

1556
01:30:23.340 --> 01:30:26.520
I saw one sort of walking through the street kind of thing.
I mean,

1557
01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:31.080
what the fuck man?
They eat the dead.
They,
and that's a natural practice for them.

1558
01:30:31.110 --> 01:30:32.820
Yeah.
And what's the thought behind it?

1559
01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:34.900
<v 1>Uh,</v>

1560
01:30:34.900 --> 01:30:39.900
that they're taking in the worst of the sins of all and that sort of,

1561
01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:42.790
they can connect with Shiva much stronger because of that,

1562
01:30:42.791 --> 01:30:44.050
because it's not affecting them.

1563
01:30:44.220 --> 01:30:47.670
<v 4>What are they wearing all over them?
Is that white ash ash from the dead bodies?</v>

1564
01:30:47.910 --> 01:30:51.570
All my God.
So they take the ash from the dead buys.

1565
01:30:51.571 --> 01:30:53.910
They smear it all over themselves and that went well.

1566
01:30:53.911 --> 01:30:57.750
They're finishing off the leg bone.
Oh my God.
And then they just,

1567
01:30:57.751 --> 01:31:02.100
they meditate and they do yoga.
Yeah.
What in the fuck?

1568
01:31:03.180 --> 01:31:07.230
Jesus Christ.
That guy's got like blood in his beard.
Is that what that is?

1569
01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:11.250
Maybe an artifact of the camera.

1570
01:31:11.670 --> 01:31:15.180
How shitty Joe when eight people and walking dead.
Don't,
don't lie it.

1571
01:31:15.181 --> 01:31:17.280
That made you a little hungry for steak though,
right?

1572
01:31:17.281 --> 01:31:21.750
When you're just chewing that big piece of meat,
it's looked good.
No,

1573
01:31:21.751 --> 01:31:24.750
it looked like he was eating something that wasn't a person.
Right.

1574
01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:28.040
Maybe it personally is good.
Yeah.

1575
01:31:28.340 --> 01:31:30.480
Especially with the people supposedly tastes like pig.

1576
01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:34.410
Cannibals would call them long pig,
like long pig as a,

1577
01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:37.140
an expression for for human meat.

1578
01:31:37.860 --> 01:31:42.030
They apparently we taste a lot like pigs,
which is really weird,
man.

1579
01:31:42.480 --> 01:31:46.500
It's really,
we're cannibalism freaks people out.
Rightly so.
Like seeing that,

1580
01:31:46.501 --> 01:31:49.980
that was a very bizarre video or verbs are a series of images.

1581
01:31:50.340 --> 01:31:53.440
Looking at those people knowing that those people have eaten bodies.
Yeah.

1582
01:31:53.620 --> 01:31:56.010
There's something about looking at someone that you know,

1583
01:31:56.070 --> 01:31:59.410
eats bodies and they don't eat bodies because they're in a plane crash and they

1584
01:31:59.411 --> 01:32:03.830
have to do it to survive the at the bodies because that's just what they
do.

1585
01:32:03.831 --> 01:32:08.380
They kill no,
no,
absolutely not.
In fact,

1586
01:32:08.381 --> 01:32:10.870
they're there.
People come to them to be healed.

1587
01:32:13.420 --> 01:32:17.590
What's their breath like?
Must be insanely bad.

1588
01:32:18.210 --> 01:32:22.060
Um,
they brush,
floss,
anything.
Well,
if they philosophies,

1589
01:32:22.061 --> 01:32:27.061
human hair loss with you ain't got now these people that they get from the river

1590
01:32:27.641 --> 01:32:29.750
that there are people that drown or something like that.

1591
01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:34.660
You know how they cremate their dead download and then they let them,

1592
01:32:34.661 --> 01:32:37.000
they leave them floating along and Oh wait,

1593
01:32:37.001 --> 01:32:40.420
what is this sort of thing said to collect these remains?

1594
01:32:40.421 --> 01:32:45.220
He used them for spiritual enlightenment wearing costumes.
Oh,
uh,

1595
01:32:45.221 --> 01:32:48.520
wearing the corpses,
consuming them or building altars from them.

1596
01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:52.900
What they're parading up dead bodies in the street.
Oh my God.

1597
01:32:52.901 --> 01:32:57.190
They were the corpses.
Wear them like what?
Tie them to their body.

1598
01:32:58.450 --> 01:33:03.010
What advise on a dude's wearing.
One of the corpses.

1599
01:33:03.130 --> 01:33:06.720
That's pretty soon.
That was weird,
man.

1600
01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:10.620
To seeing them walk down with that body knowing that they have like little

1601
01:33:10.621 --> 01:33:14.490
rituals they do with their bodies or what we do is weird too.
Right.

1602
01:33:14.850 --> 01:33:17.640
How's embalming?
And he fucking less creepy than that.

1603
01:33:19.050 --> 01:33:23.490
Embalmings creepy.
It's super creepy.
Yeah.
I'd rather be burned.

1604
01:33:23.530 --> 01:33:25.800
Just are blown up.
That'd be cool to be blown up.

1605
01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:30.120
Joey Diaz had a friend and they knew someone who died,

1606
01:33:30.390 --> 01:33:35.110
like a young lady and the parents showed up at the,
at the,
uh,

1607
01:33:35.190 --> 01:33:40.190
funeral power and the guy came back from doing something with the body and he

1608
01:33:41.041 --> 01:33:45.290
was sweaty and he was out of breath and they were thinking that this guy might

1609
01:33:45.291 --> 01:33:49.740
have fucked their dead daughter.
Like this is a possibility.

1610
01:33:49.860 --> 01:33:50.501
I'm pretty sure Joe,

1611
01:33:50.501 --> 01:33:54.120
he told me this story and they saw this guy sweating and heaving and there was

1612
01:33:54.121 --> 01:33:56.940
this weird feeling in the air and then they fight.

1613
01:33:56.941 --> 01:33:58.470
They found that out a few times.

1614
01:33:58.860 --> 01:34:01.710
There's been quite a few times her guys got busted doing that.
Oh,

1615
01:34:01.711 --> 01:34:04.770
it happens a lot.
Oh my God.
It must.
It must,

1616
01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:08.940
especially with people that are really fucked up in the head and then on top of

1617
01:34:08.941 --> 01:34:10.050
being fucked up in the head,

1618
01:34:10.410 --> 01:34:14.040
they somehow or another get a job where they have access to a dead bodies.

1619
01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:18.300
They get super comfortable around being around dead bodies and they just look at

1620
01:34:18.301 --> 01:34:21.990
this warm tit from some chicken.
You got shot in the head five hours ago.

1621
01:34:21.991 --> 01:34:26.510
This was fun.
Yeah,
and you get seen from a Tarantino movie.

1622
01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:30.700
God Damn,
that's people,
man.

1623
01:34:30.730 --> 01:34:34.150
There's a lot of people out there that I like that messed up.

1624
01:34:34.180 --> 01:34:35.500
But to see that man,

1625
01:34:35.501 --> 01:34:39.250
to see that there's a whole culture based on some how or another that was

1626
01:34:39.251 --> 01:34:41.500
bizarre and there is a whole culture based on it.

1627
01:34:41.501 --> 01:34:42.880
It's not like there's three people,

1628
01:34:42.881 --> 01:34:46.400
there's like lots of them and they have sex with a corpse and they have sex with

1629
01:34:46.401 --> 01:34:48.850
the corpses and they consume them.
They were,
and that they like,

1630
01:34:49.270 --> 01:34:51.310
they're just trying to break all taboos.
Right.

1631
01:34:51.311 --> 01:34:53.620
Is that what they're trying to do except the unacceptable?

1632
01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:56.920
What does he do at drinking from the skull?
Oh my God,

1633
01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:00.400
Jesus Christ.
What does he drinking?
Uh,

1634
01:35:00.450 --> 01:35:05.450
it may be either human urine or feces or carbonate fucking change price son.

1635
01:35:06.630 --> 01:35:11.590
Where's your father?
That's so weird,

1636
01:35:11.591 --> 01:35:15.200
man.
It's a bizarre cultural,
but it's looking at it.
It's like,
it's so weird.
Like,

1637
01:35:15.201 --> 01:35:18.970
look behind him.
You have that,
was that a Buddha or Shiva?
Shiva.

1638
01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:21.890
Shiva image behind him.
So you're,
you know,

1639
01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:25.400
you're dealing with someone who's practicing.
So you might go,
like,

1640
01:35:25.401 --> 01:35:28.820
you might go to be cured of something from this guy and he would like,
they,

1641
01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:34.000
they have the girls knew that guy with his head filled with shit in your head

1642
01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:37.970
has take aspirin and go to cvs and take some aspirin.

1643
01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:42.860
You need more tigers.
Definitely.
I agree.
Yeah.
Tigers to take those assholes out.

1644
01:35:44.120 --> 01:35:47.870
How many of those people get killed a year by tigers?
Probably none.
Well,

1645
01:35:47.871 --> 01:35:51.440
we need to do is get big foot in a tiger together in the octagon and sue,

1646
01:35:51.441 --> 01:35:55.220
who's the king and the God damn forest.
My money's on tiger.
Yeah.

1647
01:35:55.221 --> 01:36:00.080
I take tiger over big foot all day.
When was the last time?
Big Foot jump?

1648
01:36:00.081 --> 01:36:04.370
14 feet through the air to bitch slap somebody.
Yeah,
so that tire can do.

1649
01:36:06.020 --> 01:36:08.910
How many Sasquatch do you actually estimate are up there?

1650
01:36:10.700 --> 01:36:12.830
I don't estimate anything like that.
Do you think there's any,

1651
01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:18.320
do I think there's any,
any?
I think that the possibility of something exists.

1652
01:36:18.321 --> 01:36:21.320
What the fuck it is?
I don't know.
Okay.
If you had to guess though,
if you had to,

1653
01:36:21.380 --> 01:36:25.790
if I gave you,
if we said,
listen,
this is the lottery right now.

1654
01:36:25.791 --> 01:36:30.440
This is the world lottery.
You got two choices.
One side is,

1655
01:36:31.370 --> 01:36:35.360
yes,
this is a real animal.
It exists.
One side has no,

1656
01:36:35.361 --> 01:36:39.890
you got to push all your chips on one side.
Which way are you going to go?
I'd go,

1657
01:36:39.891 --> 01:36:44.470
yes,
I'm going all down all day.

1658
01:36:45.530 --> 01:36:50.030
I'll tell you,
you know why?
Because even though they did find the Hobbit Moans,

1659
01:36:50.210 --> 01:36:54.380
they did find this fanged vampire a deer.

1660
01:36:55.850 --> 01:37:00.850
It just seems like all those things are like way more possible than bigfoot.

1661
01:37:01.610 --> 01:37:06.170
For whatever reason,
big foot feels,
and I know this isn't,
this isn't logical.

1662
01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:10.010
This isn't scientific.
It feels like bullshit.

1663
01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:14.170
There's so much bullshit.
It's thoughts.
Feelings aren't facts and,

1664
01:37:14.300 --> 01:37:18.530
and that's all.
Your mom's a little defensive because on both sides,

1665
01:37:18.620 --> 01:37:20.870
both sides got nothing.
You're right.

1666
01:37:21.260 --> 01:37:26.260
Well that's not totally true because the absence of evidence doesn't necessarily

1667
01:37:27.291 --> 01:37:28.340
mean there's evidence.

1668
01:37:28.370 --> 01:37:33.370
But the fact that there's like these zero evidence lead,

1669
01:37:35.561 --> 01:37:38.330
this not real anecdotal references don't count.

1670
01:37:38.460 --> 01:37:41.150
It doesn't count because people were full of shit.
And this,

1671
01:37:41.180 --> 01:37:45.140
this is the most hilarious one.
The Patterson Footage Jersey.
That looks real.

1672
01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:49.280
The fuck out of here.
That's so dumb.

1673
01:37:49.590 --> 01:37:53.840
The fact that scientists actually examine that thing for decades.
Well,

1674
01:37:53.841 --> 01:37:58.200
I believe the gate perhaps could be a very unusually shaped person,

1675
01:37:58.201 --> 01:37:59.034
but my money,

1676
01:37:59.380 --> 01:38:04.380
so I was not a dude with a monkey suit on with football pads on no

1677
01:38:07.860 --> 01:38:11.220
unknown monkey and none monkey.

1678
01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:16.230
I don't know.
It could be real.
I wouldn't tell you what I'd be most happy,

1679
01:38:17.250 --> 01:38:20.070
most happy if it was real.
I don't know why,

1680
01:38:20.250 --> 01:38:25.250
but if they did find big foot who probably next to my daughter's birth probably

1681
01:38:25.441 --> 01:38:26.820
be the happiest day of my life.

1682
01:38:27.030 --> 01:38:31.470
I'll tell you I my two lesbian bigfoot cause it cause it.
You know what?

1683
01:38:31.471 --> 01:38:35.010
Because it means it's still freaking magic in the world.
That's why if that's,

1684
01:38:35.011 --> 01:38:37.180
if it's real,
it has a lot of magic going on.

1685
01:38:37.190 --> 01:38:39.330
There's some cool shit going on up there.
Okay.
Narnia.

1686
01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:46.230
I ain't going to say and match

1687
01:38:48.690 --> 01:38:50.700
episode 78 of come to me.

1688
01:38:50.701 --> 01:38:55.701
Big Foot magics to what I meant was tool is cool.

1689
01:38:57.931 --> 01:39:00.880
Shit still going.
Yeah.
Well No,
look,
there's a lot of cool shit that's alive.

1690
01:39:00.910 --> 01:39:03.480
That's one of my main points about all this as you're right.

1691
01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:08.510
Why do we need something unknown to get so excited about biology when it's

1692
01:39:09.251 --> 01:39:10.470
things like that shoe build,

1693
01:39:10.471 --> 01:39:15.471
that thing is fucking bizarrely evil looking real giant prehistoric bird.

1694
01:39:17.071 --> 01:39:21.200
It does.
Big Foot is closer to us than we.
That's what,

1695
01:39:21.890 --> 01:39:24.540
than we think.
Right?
And he's been looking at that saying,

1696
01:39:24.541 --> 01:39:27.840
look at that mosque Corker.
Jesus Christ had things evil.

1697
01:39:27.860 --> 01:39:32.250
If you go for cool factor,
that thing is so crazy.
If you've like looked at,
if I,

1698
01:39:32.251 --> 01:39:34.260
if you didn't know that was a real animal.
And he said,

1699
01:39:34.261 --> 01:39:37.150
look at this evil thing and this new hobbit movie,
it's uh,
the,

1700
01:39:37.260 --> 01:39:41.010
one of the things that attacks the hobbit or five foot tall birds that don't
fly.

1701
01:39:41.310 --> 01:39:45.960
And the Predator and they have a giant bill that's like the size of that's like,

1702
01:39:46.050 --> 01:39:50.320
I mean,
what does that thing like two feet long,
they're bills.
It looks fuck out.

1703
01:39:50.340 --> 01:39:53.550
It looks exactly like the dark crystal creature.

1704
01:39:53.551 --> 01:39:57.780
Remember that creature from the dark crystal Similac go.
You're like that.
Well,

1705
01:39:57.781 --> 01:40:01.830
you know,
that's one of the things that they know existed in North America.

1706
01:40:01.831 --> 01:40:04.230
This terror bird that put that to shame.

1707
01:40:04.470 --> 01:40:09.060
That's like a five foot tall version of this terrible bird was even bigger with

1708
01:40:09.061 --> 01:40:12.930
an even bigger beak and they didn't even find out about that thing until,

1709
01:40:12.931 --> 01:40:16.440
I want to say like 20 or 30 years ago they started discovering the fossils.

1710
01:40:16.710 --> 01:40:20.190
I don't,
I might be wrong,
but I don't think it was that long ago.
But yeah,

1711
01:40:20.210 --> 01:40:21.540
he does research,
please.

1712
01:40:21.570 --> 01:40:24.170
That's why I said what did the size of that fucking thing?
I the picture,

1713
01:40:24.190 --> 01:40:27.810
that thing next to a person named Matt,
it's cool as shit,
right?

1714
01:40:27.840 --> 01:40:32.380
I like how it's next to a soldier
that fucking hunt them.

1715
01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:35.610
Plastic army men of that God damn thing.

1716
01:40:36.210 --> 01:40:40.230
What the fuck that was that big?
How tall is that dude?

1717
01:40:40.740 --> 01:40:43.790
Is that Bobby Lee?
How tall is that?
Dixie,

1718
01:40:43.800 --> 01:40:48.630
an army soldier from a toy story.
Six foot tall.
So it says,
it doesn't say,
well,

1719
01:40:48.631 --> 01:40:50.250
I represent the average person,

1720
01:40:50.251 --> 01:40:54.100
which I believe the average male in America is like five 10.
So think about

1721
01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:58.960
<v 2>how God look up big.
It is next to a faux wagon.
What thought?
Fuck man.</v>

1722
01:40:59.830 --> 01:41:03.820
Sure.
Imagine you step out of your back porch and you see something bigger than a

1723
01:41:03.821 --> 01:41:07.000
fucking moose and it's just a giant bird.

1724
01:41:08.230 --> 01:41:11.710
It's predatory.
And he owns a Volkswagen beetle.
What do they eat?

1725
01:41:12.430 --> 01:41:16.210
What the fuck did they eat?
Anything they want.
What do they eat?

1726
01:41:17.410 --> 01:41:21.790
I mean,
that must be a fucking hungry bitch.

1727
01:41:22.990 --> 01:41:27.970
The size of the thing to keep that much mass.
Oh my God.

1728
01:41:28.300 --> 01:41:32.680
He says 180 kilograms,
which is what does that 400 pounds?
300 something pounds.

1729
01:41:33.220 --> 01:41:35.950
400 kilograms is 2.2 pounds per kilogram.

1730
01:41:36.250 --> 01:41:39.190
So 400 kilograms is more than 800 pounds.

1731
01:41:40.550 --> 01:41:45.520
Say Eight eight,
right?
8,000 pounds.
1000 pounds.

1732
01:41:47.010 --> 01:41:50.140
Yeah,
for 400 kilogram somewhere around in the neighborhood.
Right.

1733
01:41:51.070 --> 01:41:55.480
What the fuck?
A thousand pound bird that just runs around biting people.

1734
01:41:55.870 --> 01:41:58.240
And then there's other thing is smaller,
but it looks bigger.

1735
01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:02.620
Why is it look bigger?
But why is it,
why do they,
uh,
it's taller.

1736
01:42:02.680 --> 01:42:05.680
It's taller,
taller and thinner,
but it doesn't have as much mass.
Oh,
okay.

1737
01:42:05.681 --> 01:42:08.740
Well I'm scared of the one I left now.
That fucking ruthless bitch.

1738
01:42:08.741 --> 01:42:10.900
Why is he so much heavier?
It's more than twice as heavy.

1739
01:42:11.260 --> 01:42:13.780
And the other one's taller.
And the one on the right,
if you looked at those,

1740
01:42:13.781 --> 01:42:16.240
you would say,
which one's heavier?
Probably the one on the right,
right.

1741
01:42:16.570 --> 01:42:17.860
I'm getting more scared of the one on the right,

1742
01:42:17.861 --> 01:42:22.810
just because of its beak that keeps him pretty damaging
or not.
Uh,

1743
01:42:23.370 --> 01:42:24.700
I think from Jurassic Park,

1744
01:42:24.701 --> 01:42:28.330
that one looks so predatory that the reason why it's so thin is because it eats

1745
01:42:28.331 --> 01:42:31.120
so much that it burns calories while it's eating.

1746
01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:35.560
It's killing you and burning your count is to constantly be in a state of
murder,

1747
01:42:35.890 --> 01:42:40.750
just to fuel that fucking face.
You then thing grown off of its head.

1748
01:42:41.680 --> 01:42:45.820
Imagine
you've got a giant hatchet,

1749
01:42:46.510 --> 01:42:49.450
big bolt cutters that murders like that dude's yeah.

1750
01:42:49.460 --> 01:42:54.190
Hell and you're nine feet tall in your way.
Whatever it is.

1751
01:42:54.191 --> 01:42:57.430
300 pounds,
300 plus pounds.
Three 60 what does it,

1752
01:42:57.820 --> 01:43:00.040
what's one 80 what's one 80 kilograms?

1753
01:43:04.700 --> 01:43:08.060
Well I thought fuck 500 fucking pounds.

1754
01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:13.100
Bird biting.
You
look in his eyes.

1755
01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:18.160
No mercy missions just dead like you're looking into a mirror just dead as it's

1756
01:43:19.191 --> 01:43:24.110
eating your asshole
alerts.
It's babies that have found one.

1757
01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:27.890
Why is it Amy's coming a lot all over cause they do animal start asshole

1758
01:43:27.910 --> 01:43:30.970
firsthand.
You know that as much as I do right now.

1759
01:43:31.010 --> 01:43:32.750
So they start with your asshole.

1760
01:43:32.751 --> 01:43:34.940
It's one of the things the coyotes do that so horrific.

1761
01:43:35.090 --> 01:43:37.970
When you find deer there's still half alive there.

1762
01:43:38.210 --> 01:43:40.700
Their bottom end is eaten away.

1763
01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:43.850
They eat their asshole and their legs and oftentimes they're still alive.

1764
01:43:44.360 --> 01:43:48.060
They think there might be something like advantages to killing animals at les

1765
01:43:48.061 --> 01:43:51.710
and keeping them alive because it preserves the meat for a little bit than if

1766
01:43:51.711 --> 01:43:53.000
they just went right to the neck.

1767
01:43:53.230 --> 01:43:57.140
Cause like this guy that I was at w up in BC with,
it was a moose hunter.

1768
01:43:57.440 --> 01:44:01.040
So they came across this moose that had been alive for a days and these wolves

1769
01:44:01.041 --> 01:44:05.360
were eating it for days.
It was still alive and they would just eat its legs.

1770
01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:10.100
There was just tearing at it's asshole and they were eating its back legs and

1771
01:44:10.101 --> 01:44:13.250
the Moose couldn't get up.
He couldn't get away.
They were keeping it there.

1772
01:44:13.670 --> 01:44:17.060
But like half of his back end was gone and he was still alive.

1773
01:44:17.930 --> 01:44:21.340
Fuck nature.
Few scary,
scary,

1774
01:44:21.720 --> 01:44:25.670
scary bitch nature and there you are sleeping in trees

1775
01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:30.090
<v 1>but in the middle of it and there was a deer that that happened to an India when</v>

1776
01:44:30.091 --> 01:44:32.160
we were there,
the local dogs had taken it.

1777
01:44:32.161 --> 01:44:35.330
All they did was they broke its both its hind legs and then they,

1778
01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:39.090
then they backed off and they let it sit there.
Oh it's a two broken back legs.

1779
01:44:39.091 --> 01:44:40.860
And we just looked at us like,
oh man.
Oh Man.

1780
01:44:41.100 --> 01:44:43.530
And then he started eating and you know the dogs are going to either rip it

1781
01:44:43.531 --> 01:44:46.170
apart that night or the Tigers were going to come down and take it or the

1782
01:44:46.171 --> 01:44:49.500
leopards.
Woo.
So yeah,
still out there doing,

1783
01:44:49.510 --> 01:44:53.730
I'm still out there sleeping in those places.
You why you still doing this?

1784
01:44:53.731 --> 01:44:55.890
Because you don't have to still do this.
You could do anything.

1785
01:44:55.891 --> 01:44:59.040
You actually in a better mood doing it now than it was in a couple of years ago.

1786
01:44:59.041 --> 01:45:02.340
I'm,
I'm kind of enjoying and I came back on this season like a swan song.

1787
01:45:02.341 --> 01:45:05.340
Like let's,
let's have some fun.
Let's enjoy that.
So I'm going to cool places.

1788
01:45:05.341 --> 01:45:10.170
Mongolia,
what are you going to do on my bitcoin?
Survivorman Tanga India,

1789
01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:12.540
some beautiful,
amazing places.
So

1790
01:45:12.740 --> 01:45:13.461
<v 2>have you seen that?</v>

1791
01:45:13.461 --> 01:45:17.780
A new tribe that they found in Mongolia that rides on Caribou.

1792
01:45:18.170 --> 01:45:22.790
They have like tame Caribou and they ride them around.
It's crazy.
They,

1793
01:45:22.791 --> 01:45:24.410
they use animals to hunt.

1794
01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:28.940
They've trained wolves and they've trained a eagles to hunt for them.
You know,

1795
01:45:28.941 --> 01:45:31.100
they've known that they've been able to do that for a while.

1796
01:45:31.101 --> 01:45:35.510
Like train Golden Eagles to like take out smaller animals they take out dear.

1797
01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:38.870
But this tribe,
they have domesticated Caribou,

1798
01:45:38.990 --> 01:45:42.950
they've domesticated reindeer and they're on on for awhile.
It's wild man.

1799
01:45:42.951 --> 01:45:47.480
They ride them around like their horses.
It's like,
and that's in Mongolia.
Yup.

1800
01:45:48.950 --> 01:45:50.150
Crazy.
That's a crazy part of the

1801
01:45:50.150 --> 01:45:52.490
<v 1>world,
man.
Yup.
That's why I'm really enjoying this season.</v>

1802
01:45:52.491 --> 01:45:54.860
I'm going to places I haven't been before the drought.

1803
01:45:55.020 --> 01:45:59.240
<v 2>Is it like there's a guy look at that that's or a woman have believe that she's</v>

1804
01:45:59.260 --> 01:46:01.920
riding a Caribou like gets up fucking horse.

1805
01:46:03.060 --> 01:46:07.680
Is it welcome?
Like,
like you're doing one thing that it's like,
man,

1806
01:46:07.681 --> 01:46:11.460
am I wasting my time?
Like what is this?
Like what?
I can need to see something.

1807
01:46:12.120 --> 01:46:14.880
But the other hand,
if you did find something,

1808
01:46:15.330 --> 01:46:20.330
if you were up there and you got great footage of this fucking big monkey

1809
01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:26.010
bounding between two or three trees,
just looking at you and saying,
fuck,

1810
01:46:26.011 --> 01:46:30.900
he got me.
Holy Shit.
If we were like,
we weren't crazy,

1811
01:46:30.901 --> 01:46:34.680
these 200 different native American names for this animal,
it wasn't crazy.

1812
01:46:35.010 --> 01:46:39.660
People want to know that.
That thing's real.
That isn't real.
Like I fuck around.

1813
01:46:39.870 --> 01:46:42.510
And I joke around about it not being real,
but the reality is,

1814
01:46:42.511 --> 01:46:44.820
I don't fucking know.
We really don't know.
There's,

1815
01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:48.240
there's too many people that have said that there's something up there.

1816
01:46:48.270 --> 01:46:52.050
It doesn't mean that there's something up there.
It means the woods are scary.

1817
01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:55.110
The dance,
it gets dark out.
People make shit up.

1818
01:46:55.140 --> 01:46:57.550
People know that other people made shit up to hear the stories.

1819
01:46:57.551 --> 01:46:59.520
I think one of their real,
I think I might have saw it too,

1820
01:46:59.521 --> 01:47:03.690
and then it builds up in your mind.
That's possible too.
But it's all impossible.

1821
01:47:03.870 --> 01:47:08.550
There's a giant,
undiscovered primate.
If anybody catches it,

1822
01:47:08.551 --> 01:47:10.800
I hope it's,
you know,
that's,
you know,

1823
01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:14.280
not dean Cain bringing enhancer bastard that's mixed.
Deserve it.

1824
01:47:14.310 --> 01:47:17.460
Let's make lock mix.
Loch ness with big foot.

1825
01:47:17.461 --> 01:47:20.640
What if big foot lived under water and that's where he hid out.
And then like,

1826
01:47:20.810 --> 01:47:25.410
he like the water up there.
That's a stupid idea.
Shot down in flames.

1827
01:47:25.470 --> 01:47:28.790
That doesn't work.
It's not like he lives near a lake.
If they didn't,

1828
01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:33.750
you know what they believe on that show.
Um,
river monsters.
River monsters show.

1829
01:47:34.050 --> 01:47:37.020
They think they figured out what the lake Champlain monsters.

1830
01:47:37.650 --> 01:47:40.020
They think it's a sturgeon.
Enormous sturgeon.

1831
01:47:41.100 --> 01:47:44.000
Cause apparently there are sturgeons there and they've caught sturgeon.

1832
01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:48.900
Sturgeon get e normous enormous.

1833
01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:52.500
Have you ever seen a sturgeon?
Oh my God.
I saw one in real life the other day.

1834
01:47:52.860 --> 01:47:56.220
I saw one in Mexico that someone had caught.
Fuck Dude,

1835
01:47:56.460 --> 01:47:59.310
that's a big goddamn fish.
Then when I saw it was small,

1836
01:47:59.460 --> 01:48:02.610
but they had them on the show that that Jeremy,
whatever his name is,

1837
01:48:02.611 --> 01:48:05.640
one of the gentlemen who runs river monsters that goes a fishing.

1838
01:48:05.641 --> 01:48:09.000
That guy's legit,
right?
Yeah.
He doesn't seem to have any fucker on his shows.

1839
01:48:09.300 --> 01:48:13.560
He was in Lake Champlain and they had a photo of this thing from overhead and it

1840
01:48:13.561 --> 01:48:15.480
looked exactly like a giant sturgeon.

1841
01:48:15.481 --> 01:48:19.140
You're talking like a 16 foot long sturgeon.
Like they really get that big.

1842
01:48:19.650 --> 01:48:24.450
They do still sit and they look like a dinosaur.
Prehistoric animal.

1843
01:48:24.970 --> 01:48:29.100
That's a sturgeon.
Okay.
Yes.
That's a pretty big one.
See,
look at that.

1844
01:48:29.130 --> 01:48:32.790
That's a lake Champlain sturgeon.
So someone caught that in lake Champlain.

1845
01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:34.510
<v 7>Hmm.</v>

1846
01:48:34.510 --> 01:48:36.370
<v 2>I believe that's what that's saying.
Is that what that's saying?</v>

1847
01:48:37.060 --> 01:48:39.070
Is that what I'm saying?
Okay,

1848
01:48:39.071 --> 01:48:42.310
so these are absolutely real sturgeon.

1849
01:48:42.490 --> 01:48:44.950
They've caught in Lake Champlain and there's one that big and that's probably

1850
01:48:44.951 --> 01:48:47.050
like five feet long,
something like that.
That one,

1851
01:48:47.051 --> 01:48:48.280
maybe the other one was a little bit bigger,

1852
01:48:48.700 --> 01:48:50.920
but they believe that there's some enormous ones in there.

1853
01:48:51.500 --> 01:48:53.920
And I think that that river monsters guy,
look at that one.

1854
01:48:53.960 --> 01:48:57.700
That guy's got and his arm.
Look at that one right there.
That's not a surgeon.

1855
01:48:57.701 --> 01:49:00.550
That's a,
that's a pike.
The one next to it.
The one right next to it.

1856
01:49:00.640 --> 01:49:04.360
If you go down,
look at that.
Doesn't pay fucking fish,
man.

1857
01:49:05.290 --> 01:49:09.780
That's a big fish.
That's like a person.
It's a person fish.
But the uh,
the,

1858
01:49:09.860 --> 01:49:11.560
the really big ones,

1859
01:49:11.590 --> 01:49:16.030
if you take a photo of giant sturgeon or a Google giant sturgeon and you'll get

1860
01:49:16.031 --> 01:49:20.160
an image of what they'd look like at their very biggest 16 feet long.
Yeah,

1861
01:49:20.161 --> 01:49:23.650
there were an enormous prehistoric fish.
The only,

1862
01:49:23.651 --> 01:49:28.240
like the Gar is the only one that's creepier.
The alligator Gar.
Creepy,

1863
01:49:28.241 --> 01:49:32.950
aren't they?
They have like armor,
their bodies covered in our,
we look at that,

1864
01:49:33.310 --> 01:49:37.150
look at the fucking size of that thing.
Holy Shit.

1865
01:49:39.290 --> 01:49:40.123
That's a painting.

1866
01:49:41.340 --> 01:49:45.140
Let's say a painting to me is your ticket for falling asleep on these chairs.

1867
01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:48.100
Look real dicks asleep.
Fucking dicks checked out.

1868
01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:50.830
<v 4>Dude.
It's tired of what you've been doing to it.
It's like we're done.</v>

1869
01:49:51.010 --> 01:49:51.843
We're going numb.

1870
01:49:52.150 --> 01:49:54.700
Next thing that we're going to tie ourselves and not hang herself while you're

1871
01:49:54.701 --> 01:49:59.170
sleeping.
It seems that the biggest one that could find,

1872
01:49:59.230 --> 01:50:03.760
oh my God.
Oh my God.
Look at that thing.
It's huge.

1873
01:50:04.300 --> 01:50:09.010
Holy Fuck.
What does that 10 feet long?

1874
01:50:09.940 --> 01:50:13.030
That's probably 10 feet long,
right?
Last,
if you had to guess.

1875
01:50:13.090 --> 01:50:17.920
Nine nine look at he's conservative.
Love them.
Yeah.

1876
01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:20.710
Fucking Christ.
At 70 years old,

1877
01:50:20.770 --> 01:50:25.450
he catches a huge 350 pounds sturgeon in British Columbia.

1878
01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:28.180
That's where he was.
God,

1879
01:50:28.660 --> 01:50:33.520
look at that God damn thing so heavy.
It towed his boats for half an hour.

1880
01:50:34.150 --> 01:50:39.100
Oh my God.
Before the pensioner was able to pull,
Hey Lisa Guy,
leave him alone.

1881
01:50:39.250 --> 01:50:42.640
Just cause he's old.
You've got to pull out the fact that he's on his pension.

1882
01:50:43.390 --> 01:50:46.480
Fuck off.
Six tried to diminish the man's achievement.

1883
01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:51.030
He see Starbuck would just say Starbucks.

1884
01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:55.300
That's his last name is as [inaudible] at Starbucks.
Mr Starbuck.

1885
01:50:56.020 --> 01:50:57.280
Look at the size of that day.

1886
01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:01.420
So those are the alligator gars pull up a giant alligator gar.

1887
01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:05.260
I think these are even more creepy because sturgeons I don't think they eat much

1888
01:51:05.320 --> 01:51:08.830
meat.
They eat like little fish and whatever.
They suck off the bottom right.

1889
01:51:08.860 --> 01:51:12.720
Isn't that the deal with them at a bottom?
Theaters bottom feeders,
but um,

1890
01:51:12.940 --> 01:51:15.220
alligator guards,
they look way more predatory.

1891
01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:20.260
That picture of the mouth down there.
Fuck.
There's one above that,

1892
01:51:20.261 --> 01:51:23.680
Jamie.
Or where was it?
Go back to the,
those other images.

1893
01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:26.940
There was one.
Now there's a better one.

1894
01:51:26.950 --> 01:51:30.430
That guy has its mouth wide open where you can get a good look at that one right

1895
01:51:30.431 --> 01:51:35.350
there.
Right there.
Yeah,
it's actually alligator.
Oh,
what the fuck man?

1896
01:51:36.010 --> 01:51:40.330
Look at that thing.
Oh my God,
that's a Florida Gar.

1897
01:51:40.870 --> 01:51:45.160
How is that a real animal?
That thing looks so crazy.

1898
01:51:45.400 --> 01:51:47.860
That's pretty historic.
Let me see.
The alligator right next to it.

1899
01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:49.900
The one that we thought was it.
See,

1900
01:51:49.901 --> 01:51:51.550
you're right in the images down there on the right.

1901
01:51:51.551 --> 01:51:55.600
Lower right hand side related images.
Yeah,
right there.
Bam.
That is a Gar.

1902
01:51:55.870 --> 01:52:00.370
That's what I was thinking it was.
Let me just go to that image.
Oh my God.

1903
01:52:00.371 --> 01:52:04.550
Look at the size of that thing.
Most people don't even know what this is.
No.

1904
01:52:04.551 --> 01:52:07.630
Most people have no idea what a Gar is.
If you,
bro,
that's a sturgeon.

1905
01:52:08.380 --> 01:52:10.990
If you brought that up to them,
they'd be like,
what?

1906
01:52:11.110 --> 01:52:13.180
Go back to that one where they see the guys,
the jaw,

1907
01:52:13.181 --> 01:52:15.790
where we thought it was an alligator.
The middle of the bar.
Yeah.
Look at that.

1908
01:52:16.030 --> 01:52:19.840
Go to the full image of that.
Let's end with this fucking,

1909
01:52:20.830 --> 01:52:23.440
the world is filled with mixture.
Ladies and gentlemen,

1910
01:52:23.800 --> 01:52:27.280
don't be so quick to say that Sasquatch isn't real when that's fucking thing.

1911
01:52:27.281 --> 01:52:31.320
Swimming around.
Have you seen the penis snake yet?
What does the piece sound?

1912
01:52:31.330 --> 01:52:34.890
This snake that it's called.
There are Roth though.
Chone we need Ya.

1913
01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:38.980
But if you just type in penis snake,
it's a snake from Brazil I believe.
Yes.

1914
01:52:38.990 --> 01:52:43.480
It looks like a penis.
Yeah,
it looks like a big heart or long pianists.

1915
01:52:43.540 --> 01:52:46.040
How about those fucking things in the where those guys

1916
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:46.910
<v 2>pee in the water.</v>

1917
01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:51.290
They have to cut their hand over their dick because there's fish that will fly

1918
01:52:51.291 --> 01:52:54.170
right up your urethra.
Catfish.
Yeah.
This one right here.

1919
01:52:55.510 --> 01:52:58.910
That's a big black one too.
Yeah,
that's a nice one.
That's a nice cut.

1920
01:53:00.310 --> 01:53:01.870
<v 1>Yeah,
it's a cut.
It's a nice card.</v>

1921
01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:04.780
So it's got the helmet cover on this ready to bust out.

1922
01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:08.110
It's got a very long for skin.
Couldn't be right.

1923
01:53:08.111 --> 01:53:12.410
Like it's all tied up in a knot in the,
in the top.
I look at that.
It's wrinkles.

1924
01:53:12.411 --> 01:53:15.130
I mean that looks like a Dick Right there.
That's my deck.

1925
01:53:15.131 --> 01:53:19.390
Looks like if you need to go to a doctor immediately,
your Dixie hydrated.

1926
01:53:19.610 --> 01:53:23.590
It's probably dead.
I mean like what?
Sick Dick.
When I have a sick tick,
tick,

1927
01:53:24.610 --> 01:53:29.370
tick,
tick,
tick.
Whenever,
I don't know,

1928
01:53:29.380 --> 01:53:32.300
four months,
I allow good sick Dick.
Hmm.

1929
01:53:33.980 --> 01:53:36.970
Let me send one of these photos to a girl and see if she thinks it's a dick.

1930
01:53:37.330 --> 01:53:40.110
Like a blue kind of shakes your dating.
I had a bet.

1931
01:53:40.390 --> 01:53:45.370
Tell him it was fucking a dicon.
Narnia.
Just make it black and white.

1932
01:53:45.880 --> 01:53:48.640
It's a Dick on the moon.
Look,
we've got a picture from the rover.

1933
01:53:48.700 --> 01:53:50.520
That's a more door dick.
Come on son.

1934
01:53:51.830 --> 01:53:55.140
This did you see that Scientology documentary and these people out there that'll

1935
01:53:55.150 --> 01:53:58.540
believe anything.
You see that going so that,
yeah,

1936
01:53:59.500 --> 01:54:02.200
<v 2>part of the book.
I didn't see the documentary yet,
but I heard it's amazing.</v>

1937
01:54:03.110 --> 01:54:03.620
<v 7>Okay.</v>

1938
01:54:03.620 --> 01:54:08.060
<v 2>Is there any correlation between the belief and Xenu and the belief in
Sasquatch?</v>

1939
01:54:08.090 --> 01:54:09.320
It's gotta be very similar.

1940
01:54:09.500 --> 01:54:13.820
There is a little bit of this need for this fucking thing to be real.

1941
01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:18.050
That clouds the judgment and I applaud the fact that you went into this as

1942
01:54:18.051 --> 01:54:22.250
objectively as a unique individual as you could.
It's no,
you know,

1943
01:54:22.251 --> 01:54:25.730
no one is completely objective.
I think we all strive to be,

1944
01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:29.630
especially if you're really trying to give a good audit of your life and trying

1945
01:54:29.631 --> 01:54:31.010
to figure out how you're running things.

1946
01:54:31.310 --> 01:54:35.180
How objective am I being about this Goddamn big foot thing?
You know,
it's tricky.

1947
01:54:35.220 --> 01:54:37.280
Use a lot invested in it.
You know,
you're out there.

1948
01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:40.310
It would suck if it wasn't real.
And you've been out there what,

1949
01:54:40.311 --> 01:54:41.144
how many times now?

1950
01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:46.420
<v 1>Not to me at all.
But at this point,
this is a eight h nine shows.</v>

1951
01:54:46.990 --> 01:54:50.680
I still got the same way.
It's like bring it,
bring it down.

1952
01:54:51.070 --> 01:54:55.110
Does that guy that you're with,
you said you had issues with him?
Uh,

1953
01:54:55.310 --> 01:54:57.140
and while there's a whole bunch of different people that I go out there with

1954
01:54:57.190 --> 01:54:59.620
[inaudible] I don't have any issues with Todd.
Everybody else does.

1955
01:54:59.621 --> 01:55:00.470
I don't know everybody else.

1956
01:55:00.780 --> 01:55:05.400
<v 2>Yeah.
So is it possible that what we're looking at right there actually was a big</v>

1957
01:55:05.401 --> 01:55:06.234
foot.

1958
01:55:06.270 --> 01:55:06.650
<v 7>Okay.</v>

1959
01:55:06.650 --> 01:55:09.380
<v 1>I Dunno,
I haven't got a clue.
If you had to put all your money,</v>

1960
01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:14.080
<v 2>so if you have the at all you can</v>

1961
01:55:14.170 --> 01:55:16.720
<v 1>no matter what.
And knowing him and knowing that stuff,</v>

1962
01:55:16.750 --> 01:55:21.010
I still sit with 50 50 on,
it was just like well could be or couldn't be

1963
01:55:21.150 --> 01:55:22.200
<v 2>l o l</v>

1964
01:55:22.570 --> 01:55:23.120
<v 7>yeah.</v>

1965
01:55:23.120 --> 01:55:27.020
<v 1>Ah,
cause you're 99.9 hundred and 100 here.</v>

1966
01:55:27.021 --> 01:55:32.021
100% that's affecting was just sitting there while everybody else that even

1967
01:55:32.871 --> 01:55:36.830
claims to have seen one says they fucking bolt because the blink again.

1968
01:55:36.831 --> 01:55:39.050
I want to see the blame.
That's how a person winks.

1969
01:55:39.510 --> 01:55:40.343
<v 7>Watch.</v>

1970
01:55:41.110 --> 01:55:44.550
<v 2>Oh my God.
And what's smash cut from there to there.</v>

1971
01:55:44.850 --> 01:55:47.680
What happened there will blink.
Ooh,
Ooh,
Ooh.

1972
01:55:48.770 --> 01:55:50.790
They should be playing.
Well that's on.
Nope.

1973
01:55:52.500 --> 01:55:56.040
Have you tried to get that guy to take a polygraph test though?
Nah,

1974
01:55:56.041 --> 01:55:57.630
that's not a bad idea.
Well what the fuck?

1975
01:55:57.980 --> 01:55:59.570
What am I going to figure this whole thing out for it?

1976
01:56:00.150 --> 01:56:04.170
I need to be a secret show.
I called Jim and it wouldn't allow me on the show.

1977
01:56:04.210 --> 01:56:07.800
They're busy.
Shit.
We'll go one episode with me.
I be like,

1978
01:56:08.130 --> 01:56:11.890
this guy's full of shit less.
We're out in the woods.
He that's bullshit.

1979
01:56:12.660 --> 01:56:16.440
That's what we should do is come on son,
take this polygraph test.

1980
01:56:16.590 --> 01:56:19.650
You'd be the skeptic.
I'll be the open guy.
Oh Tom.
Okay.

1981
01:56:19.770 --> 01:56:22.680
And you could just do that every show.
How I'm probably both be the skeptic.

1982
01:56:22.681 --> 01:56:25.800
Let's be done with this.
That's true,
but I still stay at the staff to say,

1983
01:56:25.840 --> 01:56:28.290
this is,
I watched the show.
First of all,

1984
01:56:29.010 --> 01:56:33.540
I think that the area where you're at is so remote.
It's incredible.

1985
01:56:33.541 --> 01:56:37.620
I mean it's an incredible piece of wilderness and one of the things that when we

1986
01:56:37.621 --> 01:56:39.510
went big foot hunting for that Scifi show,

1987
01:56:39.930 --> 01:56:43.080
this guy told us he was a really cool guy.
He goes,
look,

1988
01:56:43.170 --> 01:56:46.560
even if there is no big foot,
we're still camping.
We're still out here camping.

1989
01:56:46.561 --> 01:56:47.850
We're having a good time.
When I enjoy it,

1990
01:56:47.880 --> 01:56:50.100
it's best part and he really did feel that way.

1991
01:56:50.130 --> 01:56:53.070
We got was not bullshitting so that area,
like it's,

1992
01:56:53.071 --> 01:56:57.360
there's nothing lost and exploring that area is it is on the show.
I said,

1993
01:56:57.361 --> 01:57:00.720
you know what?
Let's look at it this way.
Let's say they don't exist at all.

1994
01:57:01.290 --> 01:57:02.190
Worst case scenario,

1995
01:57:02.220 --> 01:57:05.910
I get an awesome night and my tent on the edge of a lake and it's beautiful and

1996
01:57:05.911 --> 01:57:10.860
you are experiencing this intense wild nature,
which makes you feel like real,

1997
01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:12.630
really connected to life.

1998
01:57:13.020 --> 01:57:16.470
That's the thing about when you're in those woods and you're in those remote

1999
01:57:16.471 --> 01:57:20.140
areas,
you must feel intensely connected to life.
Yeah.

2000
01:57:20.330 --> 01:57:23.340
Did in a weird way that you don't get connected,
reconnected?

2001
01:57:23.341 --> 01:57:26.090
Is that the way to describe it?
I would think reconnected.
Yeah.

2002
01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:28.710
In a way you're never going to get in a city.
That's right.

2003
01:57:28.740 --> 01:57:32.160
It's a different experience.
Like you,
you feel different.
You feel different.

2004
01:57:32.161 --> 01:57:37.130
When you were,
you're like so attached to the nature that's around you.

2005
01:57:37.131 --> 01:57:40.730
You,
you,
you were immersed in it.
You're a part of it.
When you're,

2006
01:57:40.890 --> 01:57:42.000
when you're in the woods,

2007
01:57:42.270 --> 01:57:47.010
the woods doesn't give a fuck about your four o one k plan and doesn't give a

2008
01:57:47.011 --> 01:57:49.800
fuck if you have your insurance card and your glove compartment.

2009
01:57:50.010 --> 01:57:53.370
It doesn't give a fuck if you're left tire starting to run low.

2010
01:57:53.610 --> 01:57:54.540
It doesn't give a fuck.

2011
01:57:55.080 --> 01:57:57.810
Nature doesn't give a fuck about any of the variables that you present.

2012
01:57:57.960 --> 01:58:01.530
It's like this is what we have to offer.
It's a wild shootout.

2013
01:58:01.560 --> 01:58:05.970
It's a wild shootout between predators and prey and there's limited food supply

2014
01:58:05.971 --> 01:58:08.820
and there's a bunch of animals darting around left and right and shitting in the

2015
01:58:08.821 --> 01:58:13.140
woods.
Good luck.
Good luck.
That's,
that's what you feel when you're out there.

2016
01:58:13.141 --> 01:58:14.340
You feel this like,
wow,

2017
01:58:14.580 --> 01:58:18.990
maybe the stock market really isn't like the epicenter of the universe.

2018
01:58:19.140 --> 01:58:23.730
Maybe it doesn't really matter in the greater scheme of the universe whether or

2019
01:58:23.731 --> 01:58:25.650
not I owe money on my student loans,

2020
01:58:25.980 --> 01:58:30.420
maybe it doesn't really matter if I'm in credit card debt and my wife is banging

2021
01:58:30.421 --> 01:58:32.850
her trainer,
maybe it doesn't matter.
That's why I squint.

2022
01:58:32.860 --> 01:58:34.800
Go out to the Bush when you were at.
Yeah.
When you're out there,

2023
01:58:34.830 --> 01:58:37.120
it puts the whole ball of wax a,

2024
01:58:37.210 --> 01:58:41.890
you might be completely wrapped up in your own weird thing to the point where

2025
01:58:41.891 --> 01:58:46.660
you don't recognize the fact that you're a part of nature.
You're not.

2026
01:58:46.661 --> 01:58:48.850
You just removed because you have walls,

2027
01:58:48.851 --> 01:58:52.990
you have electricity and you have a hat on,
but you're a part of nature,

2028
01:58:52.991 --> 01:58:57.220
an unavoidable part of it.
You're in there,
you're in it.

2029
01:58:57.750 --> 01:58:59.260
It's even if big foot is bullshit,

2030
01:58:59.950 --> 01:59:04.950
there's still something that nature is so wild that the possibility of big foot

2031
01:59:05.711 --> 01:59:10.590
isn't outside of the realm of what you would consider to have a,

2032
01:59:10.591 --> 01:59:14.410
a potential reality to it.
It's not outside of it.
It's in the realm.

2033
01:59:15.880 --> 01:59:20.490
Bingo.
Survivorman thank fun tune in.
If you,

2034
01:59:20.890 --> 01:59:24.160
if you do find something,
would you please bring it to us immediately?

2035
01:59:24.161 --> 01:59:27.100
Can we get a scoop?
Okay.
You got this good for real thrill.

2036
01:59:28.120 --> 01:59:32.470
<v 1>Snapchat,
meaningful
exchange.
Our snapchats and yeah,</v>

2037
01:59:32.700 --> 01:59:37.420

You fuck he sends you this fucking thing.

2038

This is the type of person he is.
He sends me this,

2040
01:59:42.680 --> 01:59:47.270
this text message that Isis as a closed down the four oh five.

2041
01:59:47.480 --> 01:59:51.190
Let's see if it affects any of the areas where you live.
Click this link.
Oh

2042
01:59:53.240 --> 01:59:56.060
yeah.
And here's the click the link and

2043
01:59:59.760 --> 02:00:02.240
<v 1>I ain't go Jamie.
Seriously.
Yeah.</v>

2044
02:00:02.310 --> 02:00:06.430
It was in the airport in Mexico and I was like,
you mother fucker.

2045
02:00:06.840 --> 02:00:10.790
I paid Verizon Rumi data for the buck deck.

2046
02:00:11.250 --> 02:00:15.240
I don't think it was that much.
You know,
throw you in jail for that.

2047
02:00:15.450 --> 02:00:19.840
<v 2>Right.
Um,
I'm actually in Mexico.
They're nice people.
They're not so uptight.</v>

2048
02:00:20.170 --> 02:00:22.960
They're there.
That's a fucking great part of the world.

2049
02:00:23.110 --> 02:00:26.670
If it wasn't for all the drug war shit and all the bullshit like Mexican people,

2050
02:00:26.680 --> 02:00:29.200
the nicest fucking people.
They're so nice.

2051
02:00:29.201 --> 02:00:32.410
And if I had like one food to choose from to the day I die,

2052
02:00:32.680 --> 02:00:37.390
it would be a tough call between Italian food and Mexican food.
Really?

2053
02:00:37.460 --> 02:00:42.270
<v 1>Yes.
What do you think?
Italian?
102% a year.
A pasta eater,
right?
No,
no,
no.</v>

2054
02:00:42.350 --> 02:00:46.490
I rarely eat pasta,
but I also know that,
uh,
Mexicans food,

2055
02:00:46.491 --> 02:00:48.710
it's just like three minutes,
three ingredients,
you know,

2056
02:00:48.711 --> 02:00:50.870
it's just everything's the same.
It's been,
or

2057
02:00:51.100 --> 02:00:55.090
<v 2>no,
no,
no.
You got to a t,
you know,
you get a real Mexican joint like you have,</v>

2058
02:00:55.091 --> 02:00:57.750
like they do the best skirt steak in the world,
like the,

2059
02:00:57.751 --> 02:00:59.620
the best like skirt steak,

2060
02:01:00.010 --> 02:01:04.990
the Mexican restaurants where they marinate it and they,
God damn,
man,

2061
02:01:05.410 --> 02:01:09.020
there's a lot of Mexican dishes that,
where they do it correctly.

2062
02:01:09.021 --> 02:01:13.780
Like we had some fish in Mexico,
like fresh caught snapper,
like oh ho Ho.

2063
02:01:13.870 --> 02:01:15.750
They have the best.
They invented [inaudible].

2064
02:01:16.090 --> 02:01:19.630
They invented cooking things in lime juice.
You have like really good.

2065
02:01:19.631 --> 02:01:23.740
So BJ from fresh fish.
Oh,
it's unbelievably delicious.

2066
02:01:24.010 --> 02:01:26.830
With a little bit of lime and some Cilantro in there.

2067
02:01:26.831 --> 02:01:31.180
A little bit of onions and tomatoes.
Is Pizza part of this?

2068
02:01:31.230 --> 02:01:32.860
These kids in pizzas doughy.

2069
02:01:32.920 --> 02:01:37.540
The problem with me and invented by the Jenny's anyway,
whatever it is,
bro,

2070
02:01:37.541 --> 02:01:40.020
we took it.
We made a little bit better.
You know what I'm saying?
Okay,

2071
02:01:40.020 --> 02:01:44.480
<v 4>so the nodal we took good with Bulla box assaults on that.
I don't know my,</v>

2072
02:01:44.481 --> 02:01:47.300
I'm not an efficient Natto in the fucking history of gluten,

2073
02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:51.440
but I do know that when I eat too much of it,
it fucks me up.
It's just a convert.

2074
02:01:51.710 --> 02:01:55.130
Your body converts it to sugar.
I call that a year eating a bowl of sugar.

2075
02:01:55.131 --> 02:01:58.160
When you eat a bowl of pasta,
you're eating a bowl of white flour,

2076
02:01:58.220 --> 02:02:01.040
you're eating a bowl of sugar.
I mean,
that's really what your body thinks it is.

2077
02:02:01.041 --> 02:02:04.520
You get this crazy insulin fucking thing happening,
your body's like,

2078
02:02:04.521 --> 02:02:07.400
what is all this is why you don't get that.

2079
02:02:07.401 --> 02:02:12.350
If you just eat like vegetables and meats and even beans don't give you that

2080
02:02:12.351 --> 02:02:17.060
spike the same way that the Po that those pasta dishes and heavy heavy bred

2081
02:02:17.061 --> 02:02:19.820
dishes,
which is not good for you man.
They're just not,

2082
02:02:19.940 --> 02:02:24.290
they tastes fucking amazing.
You know,
like a good lasagna.

2083
02:02:24.410 --> 02:02:25.550
Oh Christ.

2084
02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:29.410
That belly stretching feeling when you know you've eaten something virtually in

2085
02:02:29.480 --> 02:02:34.130
indigestible,
but it's awesome tour of Italy.
Sure.

2086
02:02:34.170 --> 02:02:35.900
That's great.
I'm sure I,
you know,

2087
02:02:35.910 --> 02:02:39.140
I would love to know what pasta was light before they started monkeying around

2088
02:02:39.141 --> 02:02:40.730
with wheat because they,

2089
02:02:40.790 --> 02:02:44.420
they think that like somewhere around the early 19 hundreds they started like

2090
02:02:44.870 --> 02:02:47.420
doing something to wheat to make it more durable,

2091
02:02:47.750 --> 02:02:52.580
to make a greater yields and to make it being able to be a little bit more hardy

2092
02:02:52.790 --> 02:02:56.700
and they just changed the way we grows.

2093
02:02:56.720 --> 02:03:00.980
They changed the actual consistency of the plant and from then on it became like

2094
02:03:01.010 --> 02:03:04.460
harder and harder for people that digested.
Apparently.
That's the idea.

2095
02:03:04.910 --> 02:03:08.300
And then the other idea is that these processed flours,

2096
02:03:08.510 --> 02:03:11.900
it's just your advisor's not,
that's not how it's supposed to be eaten by.

2097
02:03:11.900 --> 02:03:13.970
Doesn't know what to do with that.
It's like,
what the fuck is this?

2098
02:03:13.971 --> 02:03:15.230
Like eat a bowl of sugar.

2099
02:03:15.231 --> 02:03:18.530
Like if you had some sugar and you put that doesn't exist in nature and nature,

2100
02:03:18.531 --> 02:03:22.190
sugar comes attached to fiber to come at.
It comes attached to vitamins.

2101
02:03:22.460 --> 02:03:26.000
It's like a reward for eating fruit.
Like you get a,
you eat oranges,

2102
02:03:26.001 --> 02:03:29.180
it tastes delicious.
You getting that sugar,
but you're also getting vitamin C,

2103
02:03:29.181 --> 02:03:30.590
you're getting all that fiber.
It's a,

2104
02:03:30.591 --> 02:03:34.430
it's like a trick to get you to eat something delicious so that you will shit

2105
02:03:34.431 --> 02:03:38.420
out the seeds and fertilize those seats.
Like nature's got a whole system set up.

2106
02:03:38.790 --> 02:03:40.640
It doesn't exist.
What I'll bowl of sugar,

2107
02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:43.910
you pour a bowl of sugar on your fucking frosted flakes.

2108
02:03:44.060 --> 02:03:47.660
Like that's something that doesn't exist in nature.
Tell me you didn't do that.

2109
02:03:47.810 --> 02:03:50.360
Did you ever have frosted flakes and you poured sugar on top of them?

2110
02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:53.540
Like double frost,
them bitches.
Narita.
That sounds great though.

2111
02:03:53.620 --> 02:03:56.240
I've done licious it's delicious.
You know,

2112
02:03:56.870 --> 02:04:01.350
darkness and Double Frost and frosted flakes fucking sucked his sugar.

2113
02:04:01.351 --> 02:04:04.970
It was shuck spoonfuls of it.
And then you drink the milk.

2114
02:04:05.910 --> 02:04:09.830
[inaudible] coconut water.
Nope.
It's better.
It's better.

2115
02:04:11.150 --> 02:04:15.850
Frosted flake milk might be the best thing.
Our
Champagne.

2116
02:04:16.550 --> 02:04:20.220
How much are you paying for that Cabernet Sauvignon?
You need frosted flakes.

2117
02:04:20.250 --> 02:04:23.760
Goddamn frosted flakes.
Milk put that shit.
Great.

2118
02:04:23.990 --> 02:04:27.620
If you were in the mood for frosted flakes milk at the end of a bowl of frosted

2119
02:04:27.621 --> 02:04:31.240
flakes that you double sugared and someone already you a glass of Cabernet
Blake,

2120
02:04:31.250 --> 02:04:33.170
get that sloppy,
nasty,

2121
02:04:33.171 --> 02:04:37.860
bitter shit out of my face about to feast on some flakes.

2122
02:04:37.861 --> 02:04:42.510
Milk,
raisin bran with sugar.
What do you think before eats?

2123
02:04:50.650 --> 02:04:53.040
It's gotta be a lot.
He's pretty big.

2124
02:04:53.710 --> 02:04:57.690
If you had to guess off elk,
elk,

2125
02:04:58.320 --> 02:05:01.770
probably some mushrooms.
What did they say?
They say elk.
Mushrooms,
berries,
roots,

2126
02:05:01.771 --> 02:05:05.940
tubers,
shoots,
grasses,
deer.
But it was elk.

2127
02:05:06.570 --> 02:05:10.040
Wouldn't you find like a carcass like sampling?
We found uh,

2128
02:05:10.500 --> 02:05:14.820
a moose carcass.
I was up in BC that had been killed by wolves.
All these,
these,

2129
02:05:14.910 --> 02:05:16.560
these researchers say they do find them.

2130
02:05:17.410 --> 02:05:21.900
Really these researchers are the ones that where I got to go on.

2131
02:05:21.901 --> 02:05:23.760
It's just people who were into this subject matter.
Right.

2132
02:05:23.761 --> 02:05:27.180
So did they take photos of these carcasses?
They have photos to put them on.

2133
02:05:27.181 --> 02:05:29.290
Now they're taking photos and they're measuring them.

2134
02:05:29.291 --> 02:05:33.480
And that was doing everything scientifically now.
But if you had a carcass,
right,

2135
02:05:33.481 --> 02:05:38.460
you'd probably be able to get some DNA off that if something was Predator preys.

2136
02:05:38.540 --> 02:05:40.470
And how old of this,
but you know,
you already said yourself,

2137
02:05:40.471 --> 02:05:42.270
the DNA thing is pretty unstable,
right?

2138
02:05:43.470 --> 02:05:46.650
Out of all those sources of all the different people that are quote unquote

2139
02:05:46.651 --> 02:05:50.040
researchers,
what do you think is the most credible organization?

2140
02:05:52.080 --> 02:05:56.510
Les Stroud.
They put staff and crew survivorman big foot.

2141
02:05:56.940 --> 02:06:01.350
I,
yeah.
Credible.
Yeah.
Four Chan,
four Chan,

2142
02:06:01.860 --> 02:06:05.880
I think I read it.
Whoever's got nothing to whoever doesn't have a stake in it.

2143
02:06:05.990 --> 02:06:09.570
Yeah.
Right.
But doesn't everybody have a stake in it?
If they really can start?

2144
02:06:09.960 --> 02:06:12.600
Once you spend a night in the woods,

2145
02:06:12.601 --> 02:06:15.840
you have a stake in it more than the guy who watches it on TV and goes big

2146
02:06:15.850 --> 02:06:19.080
church.
That's it.
You have more of a mistake.
That's an emotional state.

2147
02:06:19.081 --> 02:06:21.600
I'm talking about financials and will you have a financial stake too?

2148
02:06:21.601 --> 02:06:24.450
Because it's not free to go live in the woods.
If you do,

2149
02:06:24.451 --> 02:06:26.850
you ain't got to eat food that you have to buy.

2150
02:06:26.851 --> 02:06:29.940
You have to make sure that you're not working back in the city and earning
money.

2151
02:06:29.941 --> 02:06:33.910
So it'll cost you money in that regard.
You have to have gear which costs money.

2152
02:06:33.920 --> 02:06:38.100
You're talking about.
You have to have camping gear.
Okay,
why am I talking about?

2153
02:06:38.101 --> 02:06:41.750
What do you mean?
What the fuck that got to do?
Well,
so there's a steak.
You,

2154
02:06:41.751 --> 02:06:44.400
you spent,
you spent your time,
which is money,

2155
02:06:45.090 --> 02:06:49.050
time equals money to most people and you put that eats a stake in that you've

2156
02:06:49.051 --> 02:06:52.830
invested in me.
I mean,
if you're outside of the profit,
if you're out for profit,

2157
02:06:52.980 --> 02:06:56.550
okay.
Those guys,
they're suspect,
right?
They gotta be suspect.

2158
02:06:57.390 --> 02:07:00.450
Of course they have to be.
Cause if you're a normal human being,

2159
02:07:00.451 --> 02:07:04.470
you're going to have a bias.
If that's like how you feed yourself,

2160
02:07:04.471 --> 02:07:05.760
like the finding big foot folks.

2161
02:07:06.240 --> 02:07:11.220
Like if you really got those dudes high on pot and told them to tell the real

2162
02:07:11.221 --> 02:07:15.890
truth about every episode,
like that's a good idea.
What when you were hooting,

2163
02:07:15.930 --> 02:07:19.860
you knew that Bobo was hooting back,
right?
Right.

2164
02:07:20.610 --> 02:07:23.340
But when the camera was on and you have the night vision on like,
man,

2165
02:07:23.341 --> 02:07:27.750
I heard it too.
I heard it.
I heard it for sure.
Wow.

2166
02:07:28.020 --> 02:07:31.260
What a night.
We definitely got a call back.

2167
02:07:31.740 --> 02:07:35.380
Something called us back and knocked wood.
Who invented what?
Knocking?

2168
02:07:35.680 --> 02:07:36.513
Who's that fuck.

2169
02:07:36.940 --> 02:07:40.860
I wish I knew somebody just decided that they knocked back and knocked,

2170
02:07:40.861 --> 02:07:45.610
came up with a base of wood.
Does anybody,
does,
does anybody to challenge that?

2171
02:07:45.640 --> 02:07:49.540
Is there two schools of thought when it comes to wood knockin?
Nah,

2172
02:07:49.560 --> 02:07:52.750
it just is what it is.
Either do it or you don't.
Some do,
some don't.

2173
02:07:52.780 --> 02:07:56.620
But do you think that Sasquatch is wack sticks against trees?
I don't know.

2174
02:07:56.621 --> 02:07:58.030
All I know is they're talking about,

2175
02:07:58.031 --> 02:08:00.500
they hear the sounds of like sticks being laggy and street,

2176
02:08:00.501 --> 02:08:02.850
so that's why they do it.
Yeah.
One of the guys,
when we were in,
um,

2177
02:08:03.060 --> 02:08:07.050
north Pacific northwest,
he was very skeptical about the wood knocking.
So like,

2178
02:08:07.060 --> 02:08:10.390
I'm not buying it.
There's like different camps guys.
Like,
well,

2179
02:08:10.391 --> 02:08:11.410
that's what I said.
Yeah.

2180
02:08:11.470 --> 02:08:15.540
It's at scale of believability and they're all in fighting with,

2181
02:08:15.700 --> 02:08:19.390
because everybody wants to be able to say,
I'm the one who figured it out.

2182
02:08:19.750 --> 02:08:24.140
I got the film footage.
Like,
is there a Michael Jordan of bigfoot researchers?

2183
02:08:25.310 --> 02:08:27.610
Is there one dude that everybody bows down to?

2184
02:08:28.030 --> 02:08:31.780
The one at the Hicks and Gracie of bigfoot researchers and he's gotta be,

2185
02:08:31.840 --> 02:08:34.870
I don't know.
Are you a knock or,
yeah.

2186
02:08:34.871 --> 02:08:39.520
Are you a knocker a hooper?
Oop.
Oop,

2187
02:08:39.521 --> 02:08:41.950
oop,
oop,
oop,
oop.

2188
02:08:43.030 --> 02:08:47.140
What do you think about that Samurai chatter you ever heard that you never heard

2189
02:08:47.141 --> 02:08:49.750
Samarai chatter.
The Samurai chatter was a guy,

2190
02:08:50.050 --> 02:08:55.050
I want to say it was like from the 1970s who a recorded some of vocalizations

2191
02:08:55.930 --> 02:09:00.190
that sounded like woo woo.
And he claimed that these were big foot.

2192
02:09:00.400 --> 02:09:04.060
He never looked into this.
I haven't heard that one.
Yeah,
we had a sound expert,

2193
02:09:04.920 --> 02:09:09.460
uh,
um,
analyze these for that Scifi show.

2194
02:09:09.670 --> 02:09:14.320
To me it sounds like total horse shit and he's like a human voice.

2195
02:09:14.321 --> 02:09:17.290
Can't make that noise.
I'm like,
yes,
I can hear.
I'll do it.

2196
02:09:18.150 --> 02:09:21.520
Like I just did it.
Like don't say a person can't make that.

2197
02:09:21.730 --> 02:09:25.750
This is a recording recordings,
especially from like 1970s equipment.

2198
02:09:26.140 --> 02:09:28.390
When you're in the woods,
like field equipment,

2199
02:09:28.391 --> 02:09:32.380
like you're not getting an absolute exact representation of the sound that

2200
02:09:32.381 --> 02:09:35.410
you're recording.
You're getting some sort of whatever the,

2201
02:09:36.010 --> 02:09:40.240
the gear is capable of picking up like a really good microphone.

2202
02:09:40.241 --> 02:09:43.060
Like these microphones,
these uh,
shores.
Right.
What do these things,

2203
02:09:43.090 --> 02:09:45.490
it makes these,
yeah,
these are like a really good microphone.

2204
02:09:45.491 --> 02:09:49.570
This is about as close to a Rep.
Like when you hear yourself in a podcast,
you go,

2205
02:09:49.630 --> 02:09:52.360
that's definitely made.
That sounds exactly like me,

2206
02:09:52.780 --> 02:09:55.900
but this is a recording of you.
Like it's not you,

2207
02:09:56.110 --> 02:10:01.110
it's taking you and it's recording the best possible version of your voice.

2208
02:10:01.721 --> 02:10:05.110
It can.
It's not you talking again.
So when you hear it,

2209
02:10:06.400 --> 02:10:11.400
you're hearing the machine that is picked up some sound that you made and it's

2210
02:10:13.151 --> 02:10:17.050
put this down as best it could in 1978 or whatever the fuck it is.

2211
02:10:17.380 --> 02:10:19.840
But it's not going to be exact.
It's just not.

2212
02:10:20.050 --> 02:10:23.830
So when anybody says a human being can't even make that sound.
Well you're right.

2213
02:10:24.220 --> 02:10:25.540
It has to be a tape recorder.

2214
02:10:25.660 --> 02:10:28.720
That's what makes that sound and has to record it from a human being.

2215
02:10:28.900 --> 02:10:32.980
But once you go through that,
like you're in some gray area,
like who knows?

2216
02:10:33.080 --> 02:10:37.580
It could sound like if you,
do you find it?
Did you find it?

2217
02:10:37.940 --> 02:10:41.840
Samurai chatter find this Samurai chatter.
Big Foot sounds you're going to hell.

2218
02:10:41.930 --> 02:10:43.370
So this sound expert with like,

2219
02:10:43.430 --> 02:10:47.330
what's that like part sale is at best buy or no,

2220
02:10:47.450 --> 02:10:50.650
he is a ear bud efficient auto.
Oh,

2221
02:10:50.651 --> 02:10:55.400
so he has a pair of headphones.
Well he has the beats studio pro,

2222
02:10:55.880 --> 02:11:00.650
the Blue K,
he gets the Bluetooth ones.
Where the guy,
I'm the man.
I'm the man.

2223
02:11:00.680 --> 02:11:03.980
That guy.
He's the,
he's got the kind,

2224
02:11:03.981 --> 02:11:07.460
that awkward really hook around the back of the ear when the earbuds?
No,

2225
02:11:07.461 --> 02:11:10.900
he was a real sound expert.
He was a,
and he also was like,
uh,

2226
02:11:10.960 --> 02:11:15.960
he was in the navy like he deciphered languages in the navy way off in the

2227
02:11:16.420 --> 02:11:20.770
remotest parts of the Sierras.
Northern California.
First of all,

2228
02:11:20.771 --> 02:11:23.920
I don't trust this British fuck.
Reminds me of Johnny Appleseed.

2229
02:11:26.780 --> 02:11:27.880
Apple see mother fucker out.

2230
02:11:27.881 --> 02:11:32.710
What the hell it was and I'm so they took up the tape recorder one time and this

2231
02:11:32.711 --> 02:11:33.550
is what the recorded,

2232
02:11:43.720 --> 02:11:45.170
<v 8>it's very bizarre indeed.</v>

2233
02:11:52.820 --> 02:11:56.030
<v 4>How many rubber bands you think that kind of has around his balls was making</v>

2234
02:11:56.031 --> 02:11:58.210
that noise?
Sounds like an open Mike comp.

2235
02:12:03.930 --> 02:12:08.690
We decided to record the sounds on a CD and a cassette and make them available.

2236
02:12:12.310 --> 02:12:15.170
See this is a part of the problem we're dealing with from the big for community,

2237
02:12:15.171 --> 02:12:19.640
right?
Yeah.
That's my shit.
That kind of shit.
Yup,
exactly.

2238
02:12:20.720 --> 02:12:22.430
And when you hear stuff like that,
like what do you think that is?

2239
02:12:23.780 --> 02:12:25.020
I haven't got a clue like you say.

2240
02:12:25.021 --> 02:12:26.930
I mean that could have been easily recorded by anybody.

2241
02:12:27.290 --> 02:12:29.860
What do you think it was Brian?
Totally.
Somebody just doing those noises.

2242
02:12:29.861 --> 02:12:32.750
I of course,
they just sounded like an idiot doing it.

2243
02:12:32.751 --> 02:12:35.000
Like you could picture that person what they're doing,

2244
02:12:35.001 --> 02:12:39.590
making those noises like like an idiot.
I'm offended by his skepticism.

2245
02:12:42.570 --> 02:12:45.800
Well,
if it wasn't what it was,
the cubic foot.
Well,
listen,

2246
02:12:45.810 --> 02:12:48.440
I wasn't a human then.

2247
02:12:48.441 --> 02:12:51.740
What was why we were filming the show and I went over this.

2248
02:12:51.741 --> 02:12:55.460
These are some things are considered and one time when were at the ice house,

2249
02:12:55.700 --> 02:13:00.380
we got so high that I believe the Patterson footage was real for a few seconds.

2250
02:13:00.710 --> 02:13:01.251
I was like,

2251
02:13:01.251 --> 02:13:05.310
what if I'm an asshole and what of this whole time that is a real big foot and I

2252
02:13:05.311 --> 02:13:09.560
just been mocking it.
I was so high and then I came down.
I was like,
bitch,

2253
02:13:09.561 --> 02:13:13.680
that's a guy and might be simply the fucking stupid thing.
It's so odd.

2254
02:13:13.820 --> 02:13:16.640
It's if it looks like someone in a monkey suit,

2255
02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:20.660
most likely it's someone in a monkey suit.
When you look at a Giraffe,

2256
02:13:20.661 --> 02:13:24.530
you never go,
oh,
that looks like a person in a fucking giraffe outfit.
No,

2257
02:13:24.531 --> 02:13:29.000
they look like giraffes.
Like they have a very giraffe like way of walking.

2258
02:13:29.330 --> 02:13:33.330
That stupid fucking thing walks like a person.
But I might be wrong.

2259
02:13:34.920 --> 02:13:36.630
What do you think about that when you think about the Patterson?

2260
02:13:37.500 --> 02:13:41.140
I haven't explored it enough.
I Dunno.
I think the coolest,
I think we call,

2261
02:13:41.200 --> 02:13:43.270
if you were wrong,
how could it be possible?
You,

2262
02:13:43.271 --> 02:13:46.410
you don't really haven't like looked into this even looked into all the,

2263
02:13:46.530 --> 02:13:51.160
I sat with the guy who was there.
Which guy?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Sorry.

2264
02:13:52.550 --> 02:13:53.383
<v 7>Okay.</v>

2265
02:13:53.460 --> 02:13:56.160
<v 4>I just didn't smell bullshit on him when he was talking.</v>

2266
02:13:56.510 --> 02:13:58.830
It sounded like he was just talking right from his heart.

2267
02:13:58.831 --> 02:13:59.850
Like this is what I saw.

2268
02:14:00.730 --> 02:14:03.480
Any of our aculeate gambling or being a part of it though.
Right.

2269
02:14:04.030 --> 02:14:07.560
They accused Roger Patterson,
the guy who filmed it,

2270
02:14:07.770 --> 02:14:12.300
who went to jail for writing a bad check to pay for the very camera.

2271
02:14:12.301 --> 02:14:16.430
He used to film big foot.
No one con man.
Right.
And then there was the,

2272
02:14:16.490 --> 02:14:17.310
was there though.

2273
02:14:17.310 --> 02:14:22.110
And then there was the other guy who said he was in the suit was his name Pablo.

2274
02:14:22.260 --> 02:14:26.570
But he was also proven to be bullshitting.
No Way.
Shooters are bullshitting.
Yeah.

2275
02:14:26.571 --> 02:14:31.410
That's the problem.
Herana Miss [inaudible].
Mm.
Yeah.
I remembered,

2276
02:14:32.100 --> 02:14:36.660
um,
who was a big guy who walked a lot like big foot.
Like this is video footage.

2277
02:14:36.690 --> 02:14:41.690
A montage of Bob Hieronymus next to the Patterson footage and he walks just like

2278
02:14:42.091 --> 02:14:44.970
it.
Nailed it.
You ever seen that?
No.
Yeah.

2279
02:14:44.971 --> 02:14:48.150
He's a big gangly looking cowboy and motherfucker on those dudes.

2280
02:14:48.151 --> 02:14:51.140
There's those giant belt buckles and it looks normal on him.

2281
02:14:51.490 --> 02:14:56.040
You know a certain dudes,
you see him with a giant like Rodeo belt buckle.

2282
02:14:56.041 --> 02:14:59.240
You go there.
Okay.
That's a,
what do you mean?
Where you can pull it off here?

2283
02:14:59.241 --> 02:15:03.540
Look at this.
Look at this guy.
Hilarious,
right?
I mean,
c'mon,

2284
02:15:03.720 --> 02:15:07.920
that's him.
Tell us about her on a mess.
I mean,
that is Bob Herana Miss.

2285
02:15:07.921 --> 02:15:11.740
And that is the big foot thing behind him.
I mean,
Jesus Christ.
Yeah,

2286
02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:16.900
it's him.
I mean,
fucking get outta here.
That's that dude.

2287
02:15:16.930 --> 02:15:19.590
Hilarious.
Yeah,
he's just getting somebody seen that before.

2288
02:15:19.591 --> 02:15:20.750
That's fucking hilarious.
Yeah,

2289
02:15:20.770 --> 02:15:24.150
it just get some gorilla arms that are like extra long at the end.

2290
02:15:24.151 --> 02:15:27.750
You know you got some fake hand,
had some fake fur thing on

2291
02:15:30.110 --> 02:15:32.840
or it's a female Sasquatch.

2292
02:15:34.880 --> 02:15:38.210
What'd you think?
Did that titties?
Okay.
If you had to push all your chips,

2293
02:15:38.211 --> 02:15:42.650
you got all your money here.
Who are we going to go here less?
What do we do?

2294
02:15:42.860 --> 02:15:47.120
I don't know.
We're going all in on,
yes,

2295
02:15:47.121 --> 02:15:50.180
Miss is telling the truth all in on.
I don't gamble.
Wow.

2296
02:15:50.181 --> 02:15:54.080
That's why I'm going out there.
You don't gamble at all?
I can't get more shit.

2297
02:15:54.290 --> 02:15:57.290
Come on side.
A little bit of roulette.
A bet on fights would have.

2298
02:15:57.291 --> 02:16:02.060
George said that I was fighting.
I did strong Canadian anyway.
You Bet.
You Bet.

2299
02:16:02.330 --> 02:16:06.530
So this is like a educated guess as well.
Oh,

How about this?
How about this?

2300
02:16:06.560 --> 02:16:11.030
Forget it all that.
Okay,

Nothing crazy.

2301
02:16:11.960 --> 02:16:16.100
Nothing crazy.

2305
02:16:26.490 --> 02:16:31.310

02:16:55.980 --> 02:16:58.420
If all these assholes has got to find this fucking,

2313
02:16:58.450 --> 02:17:03.430

That shithead Dyer,

2314
02:17:03.431 --> 02:17:05.860
the guy who says he shot big foot.
Oh,

2315
02:17:06.610 --> 02:17:08.560
Their stories are all very fantastical.
Yeah.

2316
02:17:08.561 --> 02:17:11.230
That's why I just look them all straight and vase and go show me what you got.

2317

Oh,

I'll stay up there tonight and see what happens.

2319
02:17:15.281 --> 02:17:17.330
If one fucking dude had it though.

2320
02:17:17.450 --> 02:17:21.790
I imagine one day it takes one footage.
It takes once all the texts.

2321
02:17:21.970 --> 02:17:24.070
One Dude,
God damn son.

2322
02:17:26.040 --> 02:17:29.200
That would be the coolest shit ever.
Well,
why?
That's what I want to know.

2323
02:17:29.201 --> 02:17:30.700
Why would that be cool with than a tiger?

2324
02:17:30.850 --> 02:17:32.500
Why would that be cool with than a killer whale?

2325
02:17:32.620 --> 02:17:34.840
Why would that be cooler than a shoe?
Because if it's there,

2326
02:17:34.841 --> 02:17:38.410
we think it's a missing link.
That's why there's no missing link.

2327
02:17:38.411 --> 02:17:41.590
It doesn't really work that way.
That's like some archaic thinking.

2328
02:17:42.040 --> 02:17:45.310
Very nonscientific and there's no archaic thinking going on in North America

2329
02:17:45.311 --> 02:17:47.380
today.
No,
just not

2330
02:17:50.660 --> 02:17:53.950
the religious freedom.
Alec as Nick,
anything to do with,

2331
02:17:54.280 --> 02:17:57.840
that's not what it's about,
man.
Fuck Jesus.
You don't even fucking know.

2332
02:17:59.970 --> 02:18:04.060
It's just,
it seems to be,
out of all the things that are alike,

2333
02:18:04.660 --> 02:18:08.560
all the mysteries,
it's one of the most probable,

2334
02:18:08.740 --> 02:18:13.090
which is one of the most exciting things about it.
Like the loch ness monster.

2335
02:18:13.120 --> 02:18:13.870
Oh Man.

2336
02:18:13.870 --> 02:18:18.370
What are the idea that some long neck dinosaur thing is living in the middle of

2337
02:18:18.371 --> 02:18:23.050
a lake in Scotland?
Fucking get outta here.
I'm not buying it on that,

2338
02:18:23.230 --> 02:18:26.080
you know,
but I believe that more than bigfoot.

2339
02:18:26.560 --> 02:18:29.590
Do you lock nest 100% more?
See,
I don't.

2340
02:18:29.800 --> 02:18:31.960
I think that's way more unlikely.

2341
02:18:31.990 --> 02:18:36.990
It's way more unlikely that some sort of a cold blooded reptile that's enormous.

2342
02:18:37.811 --> 02:18:42.010
It lives in a lock has gone undetected for this long with a breeding population

2343
02:18:42.190 --> 02:18:46.030
that's way too open.
That's like,
even if you do,
I mean even if it is huge,

2344
02:18:46.060 --> 02:18:49.150
it's still just water.
You can find you.
You would see more of them.

2345
02:18:49.410 --> 02:18:53.260
You know what I'm saying?
It did exist.
I don't think it would exist.
Yes.

2346
02:18:53.290 --> 02:18:57.360
Well Dude Jenkin Oh,
Pythius thing that did exist.
That difference.

2347
02:18:57.370 --> 02:19:02.370
The difference between Unicorns and leprechauns and the lochness monster and big

2348
02:19:02.600 --> 02:19:07.570
foot mushrooms,
big foot,
probably big foot leaks,
leaves,
tracks.

2349
02:19:07.690 --> 02:19:09.820
If you want to meet the Leprechauns,
you can meet him.

2350
02:19:11.290 --> 02:19:12.520
You just got to take enough mushrooms.

2351
02:19:13.230 --> 02:19:16.090
You can meet leprechauns like you really can.

2352
02:19:16.590 --> 02:19:21.430
If you eat the proper dosage of any really potent psychedelic mushroom

2353
02:19:21.970 --> 02:19:24.060
psychedelics,
DMT with any,

2354
02:19:24.061 --> 02:19:28.430
anything that's a really intense transformative psychedelics,
you can see

2355
02:19:28.490 --> 02:19:32.060
<v 2>things that make gremlins seemed totally normal.</v>

2356
02:19:32.750 --> 02:19:35.770
I think that's the root of all that shit.
That's the root of all those.

2357
02:19:35.780 --> 02:19:38.540
I mean this is all people that were eating plants that they didn't even know

2358
02:19:38.541 --> 02:19:41.300
what the fuck they did.
They didn't understand the mechanisms behind them.

2359
02:19:41.870 --> 02:19:45.590
They had rituals around cultivating them and keeping them

2360
02:19:47.010 --> 02:19:47.450
<v 7>okay.</v>

2361
02:19:47.450 --> 02:19:49.820
<v 2>That might be a part of the big foot thing too,
man.</v>

2362
02:19:50.060 --> 02:19:53.330
I mean bigfoot might not even be a real thing.

2363
02:19:53.600 --> 02:19:57.830
It might be a real thing that you only can experience when you're having a

2364
02:19:57.831 --> 02:20:01.520
psychedelic trip,
like the idea of big foot in a physical sense.

2365
02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:03.680
It might not even be real.

2366
02:20:04.010 --> 02:20:07.550
It might be something that when you eat enough psychedelics,

2367
02:20:07.551 --> 02:20:12.500
it tunes into some part of your memory that recreates this thing that lived a

2368
02:20:12.501 --> 02:20:13.334
long time ago.

2369
02:20:13.490 --> 02:20:17.600
<v 0>Best question asked about big foot.
It's not what it is is why?
Why,</v>

2370
02:20:17.660 --> 02:20:20.700
why is it even there?
No.
The best question is,
is is it where the fuck has it?

2371
02:20:21.320 --> 02:20:24.070
Where the fuck is it?
You're looking for it.
You're asking the wrong questions.

2372
02:20:25.010 --> 02:20:27.730
That's what's wrong.
Okay.
This is like almost two hours.
I'm tapping it.
Yeah,

2373
02:20:27.770 --> 02:20:31.710
it's more than two hours.
It's almost three.
It's almost three.
I'm tapping out.

2374
02:20:31.820 --> 02:20:36.020
Okay.
Survivor man,
big foot.
When is it airing?

2375
02:20:36.050 --> 02:20:39.950
When can people watch it?
Discovery Channel,
science channels.
Wednesdays,
Fridays.

2376
02:20:40.220 --> 02:20:42.350
Even if you're a nonbeliever,
ladies and gentlemen,

2377
02:20:42.380 --> 02:20:46.490
I rather recommend three bong hits and some good friends and you will enjoy this

2378
02:20:46.600 --> 02:20:51.320
God damn show Les Stroud Euro.
You're a fucking man's man.

2379
02:20:51.350 --> 02:20:53.450
I love Ya.
I'm always happy to talk to you.

2380
02:20:54.260 --> 02:20:56.930
I really do mean that if there's a Sasquatch out there,

2381
02:20:56.931 --> 02:21:01.850
I sincerely hope that you find it and I sincerely hope to really is a Sasquatch.

2382
02:21:01.970 --> 02:21:06.160
Would that be the cool Shit Brian is out?
No,

2383
02:21:06.360 --> 02:21:08.970
I don't know.
I mean,
if there was a such thing as a slash cross,

2384
02:21:08.971 --> 02:21:11.370
I don't know if it was cool,
I'd just be like,
there's a new monkey.

2385
02:21:11.371 --> 02:21:15.130
I don't think it's the coolest thing.
That would be way cooler.
No.

2386
02:21:15.140 --> 02:21:18.000
What if it talks like a Samurai,
if it talks like,

2387
02:21:19.800 --> 02:21:22.050
alright.
Um,
one more time.

2388
02:21:22.100 --> 02:21:24.080
<v 2>When,
when can people watch it?
What network?</v>

2389
02:21:24.840 --> 02:21:28.440
<v 0>Discovery Channel.
Discovery.
Science Channel.
Science Channel.
He's Fridays,</v>

2390
02:21:28.590 --> 02:21:30.210
Wednesdays and Fridays.
At what time?

2391
02:21:30.540 --> 02:21:34.230
Usually 10 real less drought on Twitter.

2392
02:21:34.440 --> 02:21:38.580
Real less drought on Instagram.
Facebook.
Same thing.
Facebook.
Thank you,
man.

2393
02:21:38.640 --> 02:21:43.530
This is fine.
It's very impromptu.
Did it grab you from the comedy store?
Yes.

2394
02:21:43.620 --> 02:21:46.500
Yes.
Perfect.
All right.
Goodnight everybody.
See Ya.

2395
02:21:52.160 --> 02:21:52.250
<v 7>Okay.</v>
