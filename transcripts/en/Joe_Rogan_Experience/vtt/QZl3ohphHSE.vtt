<v Speaker 1>The Joe Rogan experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.</v>

2
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.340
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're live.</v>

3
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.160
<v Speaker 1>We can't hear ourselves because Brian </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cox,</v>

4
00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:22.230
<v Speaker 1>even though he's a musician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

5
00:00:22.231 --> 00:00:25.650
<v Speaker 1>no headphone where we can still hear us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can hear you.</v>

6
00:00:25.651 --> 00:00:27.090
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just can't hear whether or not,</v>

7
00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.230
<v Speaker 1>but we wouldn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>

8
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.420
<v Speaker 1>What would we do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows he's got headphones on.</v>

9
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.150
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is revolutionary from now on.</v>

10
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.010
<v Speaker 1>No more headphones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous.</v>

11
00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.130
<v Speaker 1>What would you use them for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

12
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.240
<v Speaker 1>it's like watching television while </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on television.</v>

13
00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like if you were on TV and you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>watching a video monitor,</v>

14
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.440
<v Speaker 1>it seems weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

15
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.990
<v Speaker 1>it's a little redundant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we should leave.</v>

16
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.140
<v Speaker 1>Cast them aside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

17
00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.820
<v Speaker 1>let's just a revolutionary act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Push them.</v>

18
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.730
<v Speaker 1>Push them away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like not just put them down.</v>

19
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.100
<v Speaker 1>Push them away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We reject you.</v>

20
00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.420
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>headphones.</v>

21
00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:59.640
<v Speaker 1>We reject you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazing technology.</v>

22
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.920
<v Speaker 1>Infinite monkey cage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

23
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.790
<v Speaker 1>What's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>

24
00:01:02.791 --> 00:01:03.210
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>

25
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.470
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge fan of your work.</v>

26
00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.570
<v Speaker 1>I said that when he came in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have to tell people online.</v>

27
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.790
<v Speaker 1>This is a huge treat for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very excited.</v>

28
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.330
<v Speaker 1>Space has been my all time adult freak </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

29
00:01:12.331 --> 00:01:15.450
<v Speaker 1>Pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love watching space documentaries.</v>

30
00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:17.940
<v Speaker 1>I love watching television shows on </v>
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

31
00:01:17.941 --> 00:01:20.460
<v Speaker 1>So having you in here is a huge treat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>

32
00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.260
<v Speaker 1>What's infinite monkey cage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a long running now,</v>

33
00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.340
<v Speaker 1>a BBC radio show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea initially was to get </v>

34
00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.590
<v Speaker 1>scientists to talk about their science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it may be.</v>

35
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.570
<v Speaker 1>You said cosmology or archeology?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human origins,</v>

36
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.040
<v Speaker 1>mathematics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

37
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.240
<v Speaker 1>And then I do it with a standup comedian</v>
<v Speaker 1>called Robin Inns.</v>

38
00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.290
<v Speaker 1>It's very good friend of mine and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>always also invite another guest who </v>

39
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.391
<v Speaker 1>will be a comedian sometimes or an actor</v>
<v Speaker 1>or someone who will kind of ask those </v>

40
00:01:50.391 --> 00:01:52.670
<v Speaker 1>questions that come in from left field </v>
<v Speaker 1>and.</v>

41
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.530
<v Speaker 1>But it always goes off into some as as </v>
<v Speaker 1>your podcast do it just,</v>

42
00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.240
<v Speaker 1>you never know where it's going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're gonna call it a front of a live</v>

43
00:02:00.241 --> 00:02:05.241
<v Speaker 1>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually London and we record for about </v>

44
00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:08.210
<v Speaker 1>two hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually in broadcast every about 30 </v>

45
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.210
<v Speaker 1>minutes and as a podcast as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a bit longer,</v>

46
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.770
<v Speaker 1>but we decided to bring it to the states</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there are lots of scientists in </v>

47
00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.031
<v Speaker 1>the states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of comedians and people like </v>

48
00:02:17.031 --> 00:02:19.101
<v Speaker 1>yourself that you're going to do it with</v>
<v Speaker 1>us in three weeks in their wealth of </v>

49
00:02:19.101 --> 00:02:22.610
<v Speaker 1>Thursday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the twelfth in La and so we just want </v>

50
00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.071
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to record them for the </v>

51
00:02:26.071 --> 00:02:26.250
<v Speaker 1>BBC and they're going to be on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast and broadcast in the UK but also</v>

52
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.780
<v Speaker 1>in front of a live audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a.</v>

53
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.370
<v Speaker 1>someone asked me this morning actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I said,</v>

54
00:02:29.371 --> 00:02:31.940
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of like a variety show that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you had an accent.</v>

55
00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.450
<v Speaker 1>Do you have those in the states?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They said yeah,</v>

56
00:02:33.451 --> 00:02:38.451
<v Speaker 1>we used to have them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We used to happen the and used to do </v>

57
00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:38.451
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I said,</v>

58
00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:40.180
<v Speaker 1>well it's kind of like Dave Dimartino </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a phd and he would have.</v>

59
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.290
<v Speaker 1>It would have been that black and white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit of singing and dancing,</v>

60
00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.560
<v Speaker 1>bit of quantum mechanics basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that's so </v>

61
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.621
<v Speaker 1>important about what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what Neil degrasse Tyson does is that </v>

62
00:02:51.621 --> 00:02:51.870
<v Speaker 1>you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

63
00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:56.871
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were entertaining as well as having </v>

64
00:02:56.871 --> 00:02:58.350
<v Speaker 1>a genuine passion and a deep knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>of science.</v>

65
00:02:58.351 --> 00:03:02.170
<v Speaker 1>So it's not just like here's the cold </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard facts,</v>

66
00:03:02.171 --> 00:03:04.180
<v Speaker 1>which are amazing and fascinating on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own,</v>

67
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:09.450
<v Speaker 1>but you guys both have this way of sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of germinating these ideas into people's</v>

68
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 1>minds that might not ordinarily accept </v>
<v Speaker 1>them because,</v>

69
00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people in America </v>

70
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:19.600
<v Speaker 1>especially that associate learning with </v>
<v Speaker 1>boring.</v>

71
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:21.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>

72
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.360
<v Speaker 1>the important point series point science</v>
<v Speaker 1>is too important not to be part of </v>

73
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:29.020
<v Speaker 1>popular culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if we.</v>

74
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.350
<v Speaker 1>Popular Culture is the thing that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>discuss.</v>

75
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.000
<v Speaker 1>So if we seed that to talent shows or </v>
<v Speaker 1>sports or whatever it is,</v>

76
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:42.300
<v Speaker 1>then we're removing the most important </v>
<v Speaker 1>area of human endeavor out of general </v>

77
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.660
<v Speaker 1>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think there's a very,</v>

78
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.660
<v Speaker 1>there's a responsibility on scientists </v>
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>

79
00:03:46.661 --> 00:03:47.830
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I accept that.</v>

80
00:03:47.831 --> 00:03:50.710
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't talk at the level that I let you</v>

81
00:03:50.711 --> 00:03:54.310
<v Speaker 1>out at a as an undergraduate lecture </v>
<v Speaker 1>course at university or even a Postgrad,</v>

82
00:03:54.311 --> 00:03:59.311
<v Speaker 1>electrical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the level of my thesis and my </v>

83
00:03:59.311 --> 00:03:59.311
<v Speaker 1>research,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do that,</v>

84
00:03:59.311 --> 00:04:01.630
<v Speaker 1>but it's extremely important that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't just see all the ground.</v>

85
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.690
<v Speaker 1>We don't want people in in bars tonight </v>
<v Speaker 1>or wherever in restaurants to only talk </v>

86
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.630
<v Speaker 1>to be talking about the grammys last </v>
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

87
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.700
<v Speaker 1>We like them to be talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that the universe may be infinite </v>

88
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.991
<v Speaker 1>in extent that asking questions such as </v>
<v Speaker 1>how many civilizations other in the </v>

89
00:04:18.991 --> 00:04:20.560
<v Speaker 1>Milky Way Galaxy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question,</v>

90
00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:22.660
<v Speaker 1>the answer might be not very many.</v>

91
00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:27.870
<v Speaker 1>If that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then what does that mean for the way </v>

92
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.870
<v Speaker 1>that we behave?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are important questions,</v>

93
00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.280
<v Speaker 1>but they will never be debated it unless</v>
<v Speaker 1>we take the time and and make the effort</v>

94
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.480
<v Speaker 1>to to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to make the science and the ideas and </v>

95
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.480
<v Speaker 1>the debate around them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Part of popular culture,</v>

96
00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.620
<v Speaker 1>the Internet has also opened up a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>people's ideas about what science can be</v>

97
00:04:45.101 --> 00:04:50.101
<v Speaker 1>and also it opened up a lot of people's </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas about the actual popularity of </v>

98
00:04:50.101 --> 00:04:51.400
<v Speaker 1>science because there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until,</v>

99
00:04:51.401 --> 00:04:52.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe 10,</v>

100
00:04:52.181 --> 00:04:57.181
<v Speaker 1>20 years ago with the notable exception </v>
<v Speaker 1>of like maybe Carl Sagan and a few other</v>

101
00:04:57.551 --> 00:05:00.940
<v Speaker 1>famous people that became famous for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

102
00:05:00.941 --> 00:05:04.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either cosmologists are mathematicians.</v>

103
00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.980
<v Speaker 1>It's very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rare.</v>

104
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.020
<v Speaker 1>But now you're seeing guys like </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

105
00:05:08.021 --> 00:05:11.320
<v Speaker 1>guys like Neil degrasse Tyson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like more and more Richard Dawkins,</v>

106
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:12.760
<v Speaker 1>Christopher Hitchens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while he's alive,</v>

107
00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.650
<v Speaker 1>these interesting intellectuals become </v>
<v Speaker 1>much more mainstream.</v>

108
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.860
<v Speaker 1>They become a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people realized it wasn't that </v>

109
00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.440
<v Speaker 1>folks weren't interested in these </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjects before it was this.</v>

110
00:05:24.441 --> 00:05:26.230
<v Speaker 1>They really weren't being presented </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

111
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.440
<v Speaker 1>If you don't get enough ratings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you put your show on Thursday night </v>

112
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.500
<v Speaker 1>at 8:00</v>
<v Speaker 1>PM and you don't get x amount of number </v>

113
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.840
<v Speaker 1>of people watching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the studio loses interest.</v>

114
00:05:34.841 --> 00:05:37.780
<v Speaker 1>The people that produce it start looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>at other jobs.</v>

115
00:05:37.781 --> 00:05:38.100
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

116
00:05:38.101 --> 00:05:40.210
<v Speaker 1>this one wasn't going to work and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>start moving on.</v>

117
00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:42.400
<v Speaker 1>And that's just the reality of </v>
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>

118
00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:47.320
<v Speaker 1>And I think that with the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are able to look at some of these</v>

119
00:05:47.321 --> 00:05:48.940
<v Speaker 1>subjects and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

120
00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.820
<v Speaker 1>someone will send out a tweet or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook link or something like that,</v>

121
00:05:51.821 --> 00:05:52.630
<v Speaker 1>and then you'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

122
00:05:52.631 --> 00:05:55.930
<v Speaker 1>this got a million people to look at it </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the last 12 weeks.</v>

123
00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this has</v>

124
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:03.160
<v Speaker 2>sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of having this immediate </v>

125
00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:03.530
<v Speaker 2>timeframe where everybody has to pay </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention or the show dies,</v>

126
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.030
<v Speaker 2>now ideas are allowed to sort of grow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

127
00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.050
<v Speaker 2>I think you're absolutely right about </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

128
00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.130
<v Speaker 2>I think we as a culture underestimate </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

129
00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:16.190
<v Speaker 2>I think this is what you found with your</v>
<v Speaker 2>podcast.</v>

130
00:06:16.191 --> 00:06:21.191
<v Speaker 2>I think that there are millions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people out there who are interested in </v>

131
00:06:21.191 --> 00:06:24.761
<v Speaker 2>ideas interested in the latest things we</v>
<v Speaker 2>found out about the universe and nature </v>

132
00:06:24.761 --> 00:06:26.170
<v Speaker 2>and the way that it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

133
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.240
<v Speaker 2>and they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll come to it.</v>

134
00:06:29.241 --> 00:06:30.740
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you build an audience,</v>

135
00:06:30.741 --> 00:06:35.741
<v Speaker 2>I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's very important for the reasons </v>

136
00:06:35.741 --> 00:06:36.440
<v Speaker 2>that I outlined our civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carl Sagan,</v>

137
00:06:36.441 --> 00:06:41.441
<v Speaker 2>I always used to say that our </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization is based on science and </v>

138
00:06:41.441 --> 00:06:41.990
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in democracies,</v>

139
00:06:41.991 --> 00:06:44.000
<v Speaker 2>if your democracy is going to function </v>
<v Speaker 2>properly,</v>

140
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.240
<v Speaker 2>then people need to know about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cutting edge discoveries and the things </v>

141
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.710
<v Speaker 2>that we found out which form the basis </v>
<v Speaker 2>of our civilization.</v>

142
00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:56.780
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can your democracy function </v>

143
00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.421
<v Speaker 2>properly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's partly the responsibility of </v>

144
00:06:58.421 --> 00:07:02.231
<v Speaker 2>the education system of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I see actually the media on the </v>

145
00:07:02.231 --> 00:07:07.181
<v Speaker 2>Internet and actually on television and </v>
<v Speaker 2>radio as part of the education system </v>

146
00:07:07.181 --> 00:07:11.000
<v Speaker 2>now I know that the media doesn't see </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself as that often exceeds itself as a</v>

147
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.590
<v Speaker 2>a corporate effort to generate money for</v>
<v Speaker 2>shareholders that I.</v>

148
00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.440
<v Speaker 2>I'd criticize that quite strongly </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

149
00:07:18.441 --> 00:07:23.441
<v Speaker 2>and we were fortunate in Britain that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got the BBC whose job it is to be </v>

150
00:07:23.661 --> 00:07:25.490
<v Speaker 2>part of the education system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In part it's,</v>

151
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:27.230
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a national institution.</v>

152
00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:32.410
<v Speaker 2>So having a strong public service </v>
<v Speaker 2>broadcaster I think is is one of the </v>

153
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:32.810
<v Speaker 2>best things you can do as a country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

154
00:07:32.811 --> 00:07:36.890
<v Speaker 2>imagine a American.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it will be an anathema to the big</v>

155
00:07:36.891 --> 00:07:41.891
<v Speaker 2>corporations who run the TV channels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but imagine you had a channel which </v>

156
00:07:41.891 --> 00:07:46.271
<v Speaker 2>which really had a lot of money to BBC </v>
<v Speaker 2>is well funded that everybody </v>

157
00:07:46.271 --> 00:07:49.691
<v Speaker 2>contributed to in the states whose job </v>
<v Speaker 2>was to act in the interests of the </v>

158
00:07:49.691 --> 00:07:51.080
<v Speaker 2>nation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whose job it was to say,</v>

159
00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:52.340
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to put these.</v>

160
00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:55.070
<v Speaker 2>We're going to make these big signs </v>
<v Speaker 2>documentaries and put them on,</v>

161
00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:57.500
<v Speaker 2>and yet we'll make entertainment shows </v>
<v Speaker 2>and drama shows as well.</v>

162
00:07:57.501 --> 00:08:00.620
<v Speaker 2>We're going to make them because we </v>
<v Speaker 2>think people need to know this stuff.</v>

163
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:03.470
<v Speaker 2>We want to infuse the next generation of</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists and engineers.</v>

164
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:05.510
<v Speaker 2>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's important actually.</v>

165
00:08:05.630 --> 00:08:08.180
<v Speaker 2>It's important not to expose people </v>
<v Speaker 2>continually to,</v>

166
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.640
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

167
00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:14.290
<v Speaker 2>drivel basically populists driven </v>
<v Speaker 2>because people.</v>

168
00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.220
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People want to think,</v>

169
00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.170
<v Speaker 2>I really believed that people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested.</v>

170
00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:23.210
<v Speaker 2>I rarely go into a bar or a restaurant </v>
<v Speaker 2>or a party and people say,</v>

171
00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:24.290
<v Speaker 2>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And anybody say,</v>

172
00:08:24.291 --> 00:08:29.291
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I work at the large Hadron collider at </v>

173
00:08:29.291 --> 00:08:31.301
<v Speaker 2>cern in Geneva.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We recreate the conditions that were </v>

174
00:08:31.301 --> 00:08:31.301
<v Speaker 2>present less than a billion two the </v>
<v Speaker 2>second after the big bang.</v>

175
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:36.610
<v Speaker 2>It's very rare that someone just says </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever and it goes until somebody else</v>

176
00:08:37.170 --> 00:08:38.570
<v Speaker 2>they're interested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

177
00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:39.530
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

178
00:08:39.531 --> 00:08:40.540
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the,</v>

179
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.760
<v Speaker 2>and maybe you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the optimistic view as you say,</v>

180
00:08:43.761 --> 00:08:44.990
<v Speaker 2>is that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

181
00:08:44.991 --> 00:08:49.991
<v Speaker 2>the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll remove this culprit layer of </v>

182
00:08:49.991 --> 00:08:51.140
<v Speaker 2>middle management in a way this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the television executive,</v>

183
00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:54.980
<v Speaker 2>but maybe if you can remove that filter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's like,</v>

184
00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:55.510
<v Speaker 2>I thought</v>

185
00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:59.250
<v Speaker 1>the malfunctioning kidney in the flow of</v>
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>

186
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:01.170
<v Speaker 1>maybe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

187
00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:04.140
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good thing in a way it is,</v>

188
00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:04.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

189
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:07.920
<v Speaker 1>it's really kind of an archaic idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that you know,</v>

190
00:09:07.921 --> 00:09:08.610
<v Speaker 1>at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

191
00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.600
<v Speaker 1>Thursday night at 8:00,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when the show airs,</v>

192
00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:16.680
<v Speaker 1>airs for an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well now you could of course dvr things </v>

193
00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.460
<v Speaker 1>and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course there's a lot of television </v>

194
00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:19.460
<v Speaker 1>shows up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things on demand,</v>

195
00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.060
<v Speaker 1>so you can download them later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that that's the model,</v>

196
00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:26.061
<v Speaker 1>the model is the distribution through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the internet and this idea of sending </v>

197
00:09:26.061 --> 00:09:29.691
<v Speaker 1>things through the satellites and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they're doing it now with </v>

198
00:09:29.691 --> 00:09:29.691
<v Speaker 1>television networks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's.</v>

199
00:09:29.691 --> 00:09:31.350
<v Speaker 1>It's not gonna work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not gonna last,</v>

200
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:36.700
<v Speaker 1>as soon as companies like Netflix and </v>
<v Speaker 1>now Amazon is creating their own </v>

201
00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:41.211
<v Speaker 1>television shows as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are Internet based companies and </v>

202
00:09:41.211 --> 00:09:45.591
<v Speaker 1>they truly understand what the Internet </v>
<v Speaker 1>is all about and when Amazon or rather </v>

203
00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:50.930
<v Speaker 1>when Netflix releases a series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they released the entire series who can </v>

204
00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:52.710
<v Speaker 1>download like all 10 episodes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can binge watch them,</v>

205
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.500
<v Speaker 1>which is a great way to get people </v>
<v Speaker 1>hooked on shows as well.</v>

206
00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:01.100
<v Speaker 1>This idea that the only way you're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to watch something is if it's on NBC or </v>

207
00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:04.020
<v Speaker 1>CBS or ABC and then those people that </v>
<v Speaker 1>run those networks,</v>

208
00:10:04.021 --> 00:10:05.910
<v Speaker 1>they're in a panic because they got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get people to watch.</v>

209
00:10:05.911 --> 00:10:10.911
<v Speaker 1>So they'll throw on some reality show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But housewives that are fighting to the </v>

210
00:10:10.911 --> 00:10:13.650
<v Speaker 1>death and people tune in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is I hosted fear factor.</v>

211
00:10:13.651 --> 00:10:14.110
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

212
00:10:14.111 --> 00:10:19.111
<v Speaker 1>I understand what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a part of the problem or part of </v>

213
00:10:19.111 --> 00:10:22.581
<v Speaker 1>the solution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's what you wanted to watch on </v>

214
00:10:22.581 --> 00:10:22.581
<v Speaker 1>television,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

215
00:10:22.581 --> 00:10:22.590
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just trying to get by,</v>

216
00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:25.980
<v Speaker 1>like they're just trying to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the next American idol,</v>

217
00:10:25.981 --> 00:10:27.290
<v Speaker 1>what's the next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

218
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.800
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Show the voice,</v>

219
00:10:28.801 --> 00:10:33.801
<v Speaker 1>like what do I have to do to get 18 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million people who sit in front and </v>

220
00:10:33.801 --> 00:10:37.341
<v Speaker 1>watch a ball being passed from one man </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the other and they try to get across </v>

221
00:10:37.341 --> 00:10:37.560
<v Speaker 1>the line and everybody goes crazy.</v>

222
00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:42.920
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea that that's the only way we </v>

223
00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:46.881
<v Speaker 1>can get our information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only way you're going to get </v>

224
00:10:46.881 --> 00:10:49.760
<v Speaker 1>entertainment or any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that's coming at you that's </v>

225
00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:49.920
<v Speaker 1>being produced and created,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's dead.</v>

226
00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:54.970
<v Speaker 1>They.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I find interesting about this </v>

227
00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:57.740
<v Speaker 1>debate there is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the media is obviously tremendously </v>

228
00:10:57.740 --> 00:10:58.430
<v Speaker 1>powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously they,</v>

229
00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:01.560
<v Speaker 1>they interface between most people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>

230
00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:04.320
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I worry about,</v>

231
00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:05.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

232
00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:10.490
<v Speaker 1>the increase of choice in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a very good thing in some </v>

233
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:14.691
<v Speaker 1>respects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in other respects that you can get </v>

234
00:11:14.691 --> 00:11:14.691
<v Speaker 1>to eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>audiences,</v>

235
00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:16.440
<v Speaker 1>audiences will become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get to.</v>

236
00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.880
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say that for example,</v>

237
00:11:17.881 --> 00:11:20.280
<v Speaker 1>I am interested in playing computer </v>
<v Speaker 1>games,</v>

238
00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:21.240
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so as a,</v>

239
00:11:21.241 --> 00:11:23.700
<v Speaker 1>as a 17 year old something interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's what you're into,</v>

240
00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:28.880
<v Speaker 1>you can just watch that 24 slash seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>you just so you're not exposed to new </v>

241
00:11:29.101 --> 00:11:31.930
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I would say is that choice really the</v>

242
00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:35.280
<v Speaker 1>choice is really what you mean is </v>
<v Speaker 1>enfolding choice.</v>

243
00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:40.430
<v Speaker 1>So you mean well here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's the spread of ideas that our </v>

244
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:43.581
<v Speaker 1>culture has generated over you no more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than 3000 years of civilization and you,</v>

245
00:11:44.451 --> 00:11:46.440
<v Speaker 1>you will stumble across things you </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't know about.</v>

246
00:11:46.441 --> 00:11:48.930
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you become interested in ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>Egypt.</v>

247
00:11:48.931 --> 00:11:50.770
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it could become interested in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

248
00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:54.430
<v Speaker 1>the evolution of Homo Sapiens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Rift Valley 200,000</v>

249
00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:55.960
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you find that fascinating,</v>

250
00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:58.500
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not exposed to those ideas,</v>

251
00:11:58.530 --> 00:12:03.530
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and culture has no way of exposing you </v>

252
00:12:03.530 --> 00:12:04.060
<v Speaker 2>to those ideas beyond the education </v>
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

253
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.700
<v Speaker 2>Then we were in a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a problem.</v>

254
00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
<v Speaker 2>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the solution is to </v>

255
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:12.000
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that there's,</v>

256
00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:12.850
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's something to be said.</v>

257
00:12:12.851 --> 00:12:17.851
<v Speaker 2>It will never come back now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the old fashioned model that we had </v>

258
00:12:17.851 --> 00:12:20.200
<v Speaker 2>in Britain for many years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the BBC was really quite dominant,</v>

259
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:21.850
<v Speaker 2>was that you could almost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say,</v>

260
00:12:21.851 --> 00:12:24.040
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to put x factor on,</v>

261
00:12:24.041 --> 00:12:29.041
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or dancing with the stars or whatever </v>

262
00:12:29.041 --> 00:12:30.721
<v Speaker 2>that thing is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then after we're going to put a </v>

263
00:12:30.721 --> 00:12:31.790
<v Speaker 2>documentary on about astronomy and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea is that some of that,</v>

264
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:36.960
<v Speaker 2>the people who were watching the talent </v>
<v Speaker 2>show it will drift into the documentary </v>

265
00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:40.651
<v Speaker 2>guy I didn't know I was interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the moon of Jupiter called Europa as an </v>

266
00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:42.660
<v Speaker 2>ocean surrounding it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They may have life on it.</v>

267
00:12:42.661 --> 00:12:47.661
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know I was interested and that </v>

268
00:12:47.661 --> 00:12:48.280
<v Speaker 2>that model works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're right though,</v>

269
00:12:48.281 --> 00:12:49.390
<v Speaker 2>it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably.</v>

270
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.010
<v Speaker 2>So I think the great challenge is how do</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

271
00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:53.620
<v Speaker 2>how do you expose people to new ideas in</v>
<v Speaker 2>our culture?</v>

272
00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:58.890
<v Speaker 2>How do you get debates going?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you stimulate that kind of </v>

273
00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:00.580
<v Speaker 2>excitement about knowledge in this new </v>
<v Speaker 2>media world?</v>

274
00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:01.180
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you know,</v>

275
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:04.260
<v Speaker 3>but you're sort of an evangelist in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>sense.</v>

276
00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:06.510
<v Speaker 3>Then you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean it in in a religious way.</v>

277
00:13:06.511 --> 00:13:07.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

278
00:13:07.161 --> 00:13:12.161
<v Speaker 3>you're someone who evangelizes about the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas of science and of space like you </v>

279
00:13:12.161 --> 00:13:15.000
<v Speaker 3>think it's very important to spread </v>
<v Speaker 3>these ideas and that 17 year old kid who</v>

280
00:13:15.001 --> 00:13:17.940
<v Speaker 3>watched his video games all day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which easily could've been me,</v>

281
00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:20.820
<v Speaker 3>that that kid will never break out of </v>
<v Speaker 3>that mold.</v>

282
00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:24.420
<v Speaker 3>I think that the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the 17 year old kid,</v>

283
00:13:24.421 --> 00:13:29.421
<v Speaker 3>if he wants to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if he really is completely obsessed and </v>

284
00:13:29.421 --> 00:13:32.511
<v Speaker 3>he wants to watch video games all day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only thing that's going to fix that </v>

285
00:13:32.511 --> 00:13:35.680
<v Speaker 3>is just going to eventually get bored </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's going to want to try something </v>

286
00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:37.200
<v Speaker 3>new and having the infinite options that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are available today.</v>

287
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:39.630
<v Speaker 3>Someone could send him a text.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

288
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:42.270
<v Speaker 3>three words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Infinite monkey cage.</v>

289
00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:43.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Google it and the guy,</v>

290
00:13:43.891 --> 00:13:44.550
<v Speaker 3>he'll be right.</v>

291
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:49.580
<v Speaker 3>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm bored with video games and then </v>

292
00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:50.460
<v Speaker 3>he'll have access to all kinds of shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>that like if he was just waiting for the</v>

293
00:13:50.461 --> 00:13:54.500
<v Speaker 3>BBC to spoon feed him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's never going to do it.</v>

294
00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:59.570
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that having the stupid shows </v>

295
00:13:59.570 --> 00:13:59.940
<v Speaker 3>that we have here in America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you watch reality shows,</v>

296
00:13:59.941 --> 00:14:04.941
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that you'll notice is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the anger that people have about these </v>

297
00:14:04.941 --> 00:14:09.081
<v Speaker 3>shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the anger that to being forced fed this </v>

298
00:14:09.081 --> 00:14:09.510
<v Speaker 3>fucking stupid shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're still watching it.</v>

299
00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:13.010
<v Speaker 3>That anger sometimes that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

300
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:18.230
<v Speaker 3>that rejection of it almost in your soul</v>
<v Speaker 3>forces people to go explore other ideas </v>

301
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:23.050
<v Speaker 3>or it inspires people to go explore </v>
<v Speaker 3>other ideas.</v>

302
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:24.150
<v Speaker 3>Interesting muddle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

303
00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:29.300
<v Speaker 3>Frustrate the to deploy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just suddenly get so angry about the Ama</v>

304
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:32.880
<v Speaker 3>Guide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>soul crushing.</v>

305
00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:38.700
<v Speaker 3>It was the building this culture that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you go seek out knowledge.</v>

306
00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:42.060
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that there's something to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

307
00:14:42.061 --> 00:14:47.061
<v Speaker 3>because one time I was in my hotel room </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was watching keeping up with the </v>

308
00:14:47.061 --> 00:14:47.550
<v Speaker 3>Kardashians and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

309
00:14:47.551 --> 00:14:49.170
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was in between shows like,</v>

310
00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:54.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just flipping through the channels and </v>

311
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:56.290
<v Speaker 3>it was on and it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm shopping and I can't find what I </v>

312
00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:56.750
<v Speaker 3>want to get.</v>

313
00:14:56.780 --> 00:15:00.020
<v Speaker 3>This is so frustrating and my sister </v>
<v Speaker 3>won't stop bothering me.</v>

314
00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:03.440
<v Speaker 3>And they're like texting each other and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so fucking mind numbing.</v>

315
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:07.510
<v Speaker 3>And somehow or another I'm sucked into </v>
<v Speaker 3>it like it's a tornado and it's carrying</v>

316
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:12.550
<v Speaker 3>away up into the sky and then I changed </v>
<v Speaker 3>the next channel and it's some biology </v>

317
00:15:13.761 --> 00:15:18.761
<v Speaker 3>thing on crocodiles and it's instantly </v>
<v Speaker 3>fascinating and it's these people that </v>

318
00:15:18.861 --> 00:15:23.861
<v Speaker 3>live on denial and this scientist who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>down there and he's studying these </v>

319
00:15:23.861 --> 00:15:27.731
<v Speaker 3>crocodiles and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's the villagers who are worried </v>

320
00:15:27.731 --> 00:15:27.731
<v Speaker 3>about these things eating them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I'm thinking,</v>

321
00:15:27.731 --> 00:15:28.940
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is so fucking fascinating.</v>

322
00:15:28.941 --> 00:15:32.180
<v Speaker 3>These people are living next to </v>
<v Speaker 3>dinosaurs.</v>

323
00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:36.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean they have a real issue with </v>
<v Speaker 3>dinosaurs eating their family like.</v>

324
00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:41.920
<v Speaker 3>Or You could watch these just simple </v>
<v Speaker 3>apes talk about shiny things and they'll</v>

325
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:46.340
<v Speaker 3>talk about shiny things and millions of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking people do,</v>

326
00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:49.190
<v Speaker 3>but that the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the anger of can't take this anymore.</v>

327
00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:52.340
<v Speaker 3>And then you switched the channel or go </v>
<v Speaker 3>online.</v>

328
00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:55.490
<v Speaker 3>I really think that does.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a yin and a Yang to the world,</v>

329
00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:00.520
<v Speaker 3>the strongest case for the cadets that </v>
<v Speaker 3>compresses your very soul and existence </v>

330
00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:07.430
<v Speaker 3>into such a small space that you out </v>
<v Speaker 3>into a world of ideas.</v>

331
00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:10.550
<v Speaker 3>So that that's what's analogous to </v>
<v Speaker 3>California.</v>

332
00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:12.980
<v Speaker 3>Because in California we have too much </v>
<v Speaker 3>sun.</v>

333
00:16:13.130 --> 00:16:14.720
<v Speaker 3>We have so much sun that it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>rain.</v>

334
00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:19.900
<v Speaker 3>We need 11 trillion gallons of water </v>
<v Speaker 3>just to make up for the water that </v>

335
00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:22.550
<v Speaker 3>didn't rain in the last three years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a fucking disaster,</v>

336
00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:28.180
<v Speaker 3>but if you lived in a place like Alaska </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the winter where there's no fucking </v>

337
00:16:29.091 --> 00:16:34.091
<v Speaker 3>son at all and just looking for little </v>
<v Speaker 3>peaks in the clouds or those those days </v>

338
00:16:34.101 --> 00:16:37.070
<v Speaker 3>in Portland where it's just 39 days in a</v>
<v Speaker 3>row,</v>

339
00:16:37.071 --> 00:16:39.680
<v Speaker 3>there's no fucking son.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just did crazy.</v>

340
00:16:39.681 --> 00:16:44.681
<v Speaker 3>You can't take it anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then one day that sun is there and </v>

341
00:16:44.681 --> 00:16:44.681
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

342
00:16:44.681 --> 00:16:46.640
<v Speaker 3>it's so beautiful.</v>

343
00:16:46.650 --> 00:16:48.950
<v Speaker 3>Some May.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas in La were like,</v>

344
00:16:48.951 --> 00:16:51.290
<v Speaker 3>fucking son,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're so tired of the sun.</v>

345
00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:54.020
<v Speaker 3>We just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People get used to shit.</v>

346
00:16:54.021 --> 00:16:56.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to call it the Rogan muddle </v>
<v Speaker 3>when she's.</v>

347
00:16:56.560 --> 00:17:01.560
<v Speaker 3>When she's just depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every rogue of muddle the broadcast in </v>

348
00:17:02.290 --> 00:17:06.630
<v Speaker 3>the fuck out of them and they'll surely </v>
<v Speaker 3>at some point the cosmos.</v>

349
00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:13.120
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then when it comes on and then they </v>

350
00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:15.020
<v Speaker 3>get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well not everyone.</v>

351
00:17:15.021 --> 00:17:18.710
<v Speaker 3>There's gonna be some people that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>always going to be.</v>

352
00:17:18.770 --> 00:17:21.050
<v Speaker 3>They're going to always gravitate </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards nonsense.</v>

353
00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:25.490
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing you can do about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just we're so varied.</v>

354
00:17:25.491 --> 00:17:30.491
<v Speaker 3>We're so the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the spectrum of human beings from the </v>

355
00:17:30.491 --> 00:17:32.450
<v Speaker 3>smartest to the dumbest is so wide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no getting around that.</v>

356
00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:34.160
<v Speaker 3>Life experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 3>genetics,</v>

357
00:17:34.161 --> 00:17:35.690
<v Speaker 3>whatever causes it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

358
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:40.870
<v Speaker 3>but there's just certain people that do </v>
<v Speaker 3>not give a fuck and they're going to </v>

359
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:42.410
<v Speaker 3>always be there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but concentrating on them,</v>

360
00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:43.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

361
00:17:43.341 --> 00:17:43.850
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

362
00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:47.930
<v Speaker 3>and like it's profitable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you could sell them shit.</v>

363
00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:50.100
<v Speaker 3>It's a really good if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're</v>

364
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:51.850
<v Speaker 1>in the business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he days.</v>

365
00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:52.980
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still,</v>

366
00:17:52.981 --> 00:17:55.910
<v Speaker 1>you said Lee though I'm perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>optimistic of Va.</v>

367
00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:59.910
<v Speaker 1>I think you could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we can sell them.</v>

368
00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:02.290
<v Speaker 1>It sounds almost them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this group.</v>

369
00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.870
<v Speaker 1>Some of them you could sell it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

370
00:18:05.220 --> 00:18:07.110
<v Speaker 1>I still think you can sell ideas to </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

371
00:18:07.111 --> 00:18:09.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to mystic about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those people maybe not,</v>

372
00:18:09.961 --> 00:18:14.961
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's $350 million people in this </v>

373
00:18:14.961 --> 00:18:15.580
<v Speaker 1>country alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>we underestimate people.</v>

374
00:18:15.581 --> 00:18:16.230
<v Speaker 1>I think I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

375
00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.850
<v Speaker 1>I've rarely met someone who wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in.</v>

376
00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:24.100
<v Speaker 1>Let me take your sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you going to take home and bring it </v>

377
00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:26.220
<v Speaker 1>around some dummies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some fucking dummies out there.</v>

378
00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:29.160
<v Speaker 1>a lot of smart folks like yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're hanging out at cern,</v>

379
00:18:29.370 --> 00:18:34.370
<v Speaker 1>will a bunch of other physicists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about black holes and </v>

380
00:18:34.370 --> 00:18:34.370
<v Speaker 1>chelation effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

381
00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:37.660
<v Speaker 1>I've never been into the cafeteria at </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain.</v>

382
00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.360
<v Speaker 1>Anyone who's not interested in asking </v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

383
00:18:39.361 --> 00:18:44.361
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hosted fear factor for six years and </v>

384
00:18:44.361 --> 00:18:44.361
<v Speaker 1>I'm a cage fighting commentator.</v>

385
00:18:44.361 --> 00:18:49.160
<v Speaker 1>There's dummIes out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a unfixable dummies and it's </v>

386
00:18:49.621 --> 00:18:54.621
<v Speaker 1>probably not their fault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's probably one of the greatest </v>

387
00:18:54.621 --> 00:18:57.981
<v Speaker 1>pieces of evidence to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Points towards natural selection and </v>

388
00:18:57.981 --> 00:19:00.600
<v Speaker 1>point sorts of variability of life and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that human beings.</v>

389
00:19:00.601 --> 00:19:05.550
<v Speaker 1>We very so strongly that in comparison </v>
<v Speaker 1>to other wild animals,</v>

390
00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:10.700
<v Speaker 1>if you see wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me and you see wolves that are slightly </v>

391
00:19:10.700 --> 00:19:14.241
<v Speaker 1>larger and slightly more dominant and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wolves that are slightly smaller and </v>

392
00:19:14.241 --> 00:19:14.670
<v Speaker 1>slightly more timid and they get pushed </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the pack,</v>

393
00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:19.790
<v Speaker 1>but they're all fucking wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You See people and you see Brian Cox and</v>

394
00:19:19.831 --> 00:19:24.831
<v Speaker 1>then you see kim kardashians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you guys are both on the same </v>

395
00:19:24.831 --> 00:19:28.371
<v Speaker 1>timeline here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're both alive in this point in </v>

396
00:19:28.371 --> 00:19:31.371
<v Speaker 1>history and one of you is talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking shoes and the other one is </v>

397
00:19:31.371 --> 00:19:33.570
<v Speaker 1>trying to figure out what happened right</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the big bang and one of them has a</v>

398
00:19:33.571 --> 00:19:35.370
<v Speaker 1>fuck load more people paying attention.</v>

399
00:19:35.370 --> 00:19:40.370
<v Speaker 1>Brian cox and it ate you buddy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the chick with the fake ass was </v>

400
00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:43.110
<v Speaker 1>getting all the eyeballs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carl sagan is great book,</v>

401
00:19:43.111 --> 00:19:45.450
<v Speaker 1>the demon haunted world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love that book.</v>

402
00:19:45.690 --> 00:19:50.690
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he makes the point that the thing is </v>

403
00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:50.690
<v Speaker 1>these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone has a vote and rightly so.</v>

404
00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:52.410
<v Speaker 1>We live in a democracy right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mIght say,</v>

405
00:19:52.411 --> 00:19:54.240
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could we have some kInd of icu,</v>

406
00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:59.280
<v Speaker 1>such threshold for the votes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but therefore the direction of our </v>

407
00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.820
<v Speaker 1>societies ease in principle in the hands</v>
<v Speaker 1>of everyone.</v>

408
00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:08.070
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we can't just accept the fact that </v>

409
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

410
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:11.721
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well one percent of the world's </v>

411
00:20:11.721 --> 00:20:13.221
<v Speaker 1>population is going to pay attention to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to reality and the rest of them are </v>

412
00:20:13.221 --> 00:20:14.910
<v Speaker 1>going to pay attention to reality tv and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be,</v>

413
00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:20.090
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to be okay because the </v>

414
00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:20.290
<v Speaker 1>99 percent will be on the web.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're voting for that.</v>

415
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:25.310
<v Speaker 1>They have control and rightly so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We live in a over the direction of our </v>

416
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:27.390
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So education is extremely important.</v>

417
00:20:27.391 --> 00:20:32.391
<v Speaker 1>It is important for people to sit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for us to try and make available the </v>

418
00:20:32.391 --> 00:20:35.460
<v Speaker 1>great swathe of knowledge that we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>accumulated over the last.</v>

419
00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:39.270
<v Speaker 1>We were absolutely in agreement about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

420
00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:44.540
<v Speaker 1>I just think that the open nature of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>internet enhances that more than stifles</v>

421
00:20:46.411 --> 00:20:47.350
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

422
00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:49.930
<v Speaker 3>there's only good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I only see good.</v>

423
00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:55.140
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm a big fan of old shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love to go watch old television shows </v>

424
00:20:56.350 --> 00:20:57.520
<v Speaker 3>and old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

425
00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:02.760
<v Speaker 3>old movies and old especially old </v>
<v Speaker 3>standup comedy performances because </v>

426
00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.230
<v Speaker 3>there's not just because it's sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>like a time machine.</v>

427
00:21:05.231 --> 00:21:05.590
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

428
00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:08.230
<v Speaker 3>you're lookIng back at this moment </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's been captured,</v>

429
00:21:08.231 --> 00:21:13.231
<v Speaker 3>which is absolutely fascinating to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But also the stark differences to the </v>

430
00:21:13.231 --> 00:21:18.150
<v Speaker 3>obvious differences between culture then</v>
<v Speaker 3>and culture now between the awareness of</v>

431
00:21:18.371 --> 00:21:21.610
<v Speaker 3>the people that like there's some movies</v>
<v Speaker 3>that were really good movies,</v>

432
00:21:21.611 --> 00:21:22.930
<v Speaker 3>but if you try to wash them today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>

433
00:21:22.931 --> 00:21:24.370
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's that fucking dumb today?</v>

434
00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.740
<v Speaker 3>Like no one is that dumb today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard.</v>

435
00:21:26.741 --> 00:21:31.300
<v Speaker 3>Like the education level of the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are communicating in these movies,</v>

436
00:21:31.450 --> 00:21:36.450
<v Speaker 3>the way they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they view life is very obviously </v>

437
00:21:36.450 --> 00:21:36.880
<v Speaker 3>different than the way we view life </v>
<v Speaker 3>today.</v>

438
00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:42.120
<v Speaker 3>Like you could noT put father knows best</v>
<v Speaker 3>on television today because people </v>

439
00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:43.510
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not like not enough.</v>

440
00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:48.720
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gotta it's gotta go to a higher </v>

441
00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.050
<v Speaker 3>frequency because human beings are very </v>
<v Speaker 3>different today than they were in 1950.</v>

442
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.500
<v Speaker 3>I think our culture is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>clearest influences.</v>

443
00:21:53.770 --> 00:21:57.460
<v Speaker 3>There's some amazing stuff from 1950,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so amazing books that were written.</v>

444
00:21:57.461 --> 00:22:02.461
<v Speaker 3>There's amazing films that were made,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the reality is the culture has </v>

445
00:22:02.461 --> 00:22:04.690
<v Speaker 3>shifted dramatically in the last 64 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

446
00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:10.260
<v Speaker 3>there's no getting around that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's changing and I think having </v>

447
00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:14.070
<v Speaker 3>something like the internet just pushes </v>
<v Speaker 3>that in a direction and the guidelines.</v>

448
00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:16.930
<v Speaker 3>You who gets upset,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a guy like you who gets upset,</v>

449
00:22:16.931 --> 00:22:19.750
<v Speaker 3>all these reality shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really just proof that that this is</v>

450
00:22:19.751 --> 00:22:24.751
<v Speaker 3>what you're designed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like designed to educate these </v>

451
00:22:24.751 --> 00:22:25.240
<v Speaker 3>people that are annoying you in these </v>
<v Speaker 3>programs that are stupid.</v>

452
00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:28.450
<v Speaker 3>That's actually just fuel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just giving you more.</v>

453
00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:33.600
<v Speaker 3>It's giving you an adversary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's giving you motivation to stop it </v>

454
00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:34.420
<v Speaker 3>from happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's.</v>

455
00:22:34.421 --> 00:22:39.421
<v Speaker 3>If everybody was going to college and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody was super educated and really </v>

456
00:22:39.421 --> 00:22:44.221
<v Speaker 3>aware of the problems with plastic and </v>
<v Speaker 3>fossil fuels and boy,</v>

457
00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:47.260
<v Speaker 3>what a weird world we live in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably nothing would ever get done.</v>

458
00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:52.500
<v Speaker 3>Like the battle between the dummies and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the people like yourself is essential.</v>

459
00:22:53.201 --> 00:22:55.850
<v Speaker 3>It's essential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then yang idea,</v>

460
00:22:55.900 --> 00:23:00.900
<v Speaker 3>the thesis that the defining the motor </v>
<v Speaker 3>of civilization and human advancement is</v>

461
00:23:01.600 --> 00:23:04.050
<v Speaker 3>irritation with dumb people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it is.</v>

462
00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:07.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't appreciate naps unless I work </v>
<v Speaker 3>out hard.</v>

463
00:23:07.750 --> 00:23:11.590
<v Speaker 3>I don't appreciate vacations unless I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>just exhausted.</v>

464
00:23:11.980 --> 00:23:15.880
<v Speaker 3>I have to be exhausted with work to </v>
<v Speaker 3>appreciate vacations.</v>

465
00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:17.230
<v Speaker 3>I must say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's one of the threads,</v>

466
00:23:17.231 --> 00:23:18.910
<v Speaker 3>so maybe we started talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>infinite monkey cage.</v>

467
00:23:18.911 --> 00:23:23.911
<v Speaker 3>He's one of the threads through the </v>
<v Speaker 3>whole series is a slight annoyance that </v>

468
00:23:23.911 --> 00:23:26.410
<v Speaker 3>we turned into into something that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting.</v>

469
00:23:26.411 --> 00:23:27.400
<v Speaker 3>Generates ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pros,</v>

470
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:30.040
<v Speaker 3>I mean one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had a letter about the title,</v>

471
00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:34.270
<v Speaker 3>the infinite monkey cage complaining and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they shouldn't catch monkeys.</v>

472
00:23:34.710 --> 00:23:38.980
<v Speaker 3>It was cruel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crew is like an infinite.</v>

473
00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:41.390
<v Speaker 3>It's an infinite cage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's me.</v>

474
00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:43.930
<v Speaker 3>It's recently love room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's arguably the universe.</v>

475
00:23:43.931 --> 00:23:46.220
<v Speaker 3>There's an infinite cage and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>another</v>

476
00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.870
<v Speaker 1>less it came in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it might have been a response.</v>

477
00:23:47.871 --> 00:23:49.430
<v Speaker 1>So we'd send that back and they said </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>

478
00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:53.240
<v Speaker 1>It's also support in this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>darwinian myth,</v>

479
00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:57.590
<v Speaker 1>the darwinian myth that we're somehow </v>
<v Speaker 1>share a common ancestor with a monkey.</v>

480
00:23:58.160 --> 00:23:59.860
<v Speaker 1>So how so?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

481
00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:04.930
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was an experiment done that </v>

482
00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:04.970
<v Speaker 1>disproved all your nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like experiments.</v>

483
00:24:04.971 --> 00:24:07.400
<v Speaker 1>We like evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So This is really interesting.</v>

484
00:24:07.401 --> 00:24:12.401
<v Speaker 1>What's the evidence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we read down and they said there was </v>

485
00:24:12.401 --> 00:24:15.341
<v Speaker 1>an experiment done in a zoo in Alabama </v>
<v Speaker 1>or somewhere where they got 10 monkeys </v>

486
00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:21.250
<v Speaker 1>and they gave them tight writers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>after a week all they done was shit on </v>

487
00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:26.231
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the idea that an infinite number of </v>

488
00:24:26.231 --> 00:24:26.570
<v Speaker 1>monkeys could write shakespeare and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

489
00:24:27.270 --> 00:24:32.270
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there's a difference between 10 </v>

490
00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:33.170
<v Speaker 1>monkeys and an infinite number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>monkeys.</v>

491
00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:34.450
<v Speaker 1>There's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

492
00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:39.250
<v Speaker 1>10 is not very close to infinity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just these complaints about the.</v>

493
00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:44.470
<v Speaker 1>And we were my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend robin into our co presented </v>

494
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:44.470
<v Speaker 1>where the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

495
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:46.490
<v Speaker 1>he said it's not an incremental process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this kind of infinite monkey thing.</v>

496
00:24:46.610 --> 00:24:51.610
<v Speaker 1>It's not like if you have 100 monkeys </v>
<v Speaker 1>then eventually they'll produce a </v>

497
00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:53.780
<v Speaker 1>leaflet and then if you have a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll do maybe a book.</v>

498
00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:57.680
<v Speaker 1>if you had 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll do shakespeare.</v>

499
00:24:57.890 --> 00:24:59.630
<v Speaker 1>And it's not really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we mean it,</v>

500
00:24:59.631 --> 00:25:02.220
<v Speaker 1>it's an infinite number of monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd need to type out the words.</v>

501
00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:04.070
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got a lot of.</v>

502
00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:06.110
<v Speaker 1>We enjoy the complaint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've got a lot from.</v>

503
00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:11.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Got a lot of complaints from deepak </v>

504
00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:11.700
<v Speaker 1>chopra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

505
00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:11.700
<v Speaker 1>these days he's a silly version late,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

506
00:25:11.700 --> 00:25:13.360
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that one of those things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

507
00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:18.440
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like one of those expressions </v>

508
00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.991
<v Speaker 1>that people always use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you take an infinite number of </v>

509
00:25:19.991 --> 00:25:21.851
<v Speaker 1>monkeys and given the typewriters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll type out shakespeare's works of </v>

510
00:25:21.851 --> 00:25:21.851
<v Speaker 1>shakespeare.</v>

511
00:25:21.851 --> 00:25:21.980
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that true?</v>

512
00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:27.160
<v Speaker 1>While it is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an infinite number of monkeys have </v>

513
00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:27.160
<v Speaker 1>infinite number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're going to fail.</v>

514
00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.670
<v Speaker 1>They're going to fuck it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No monkeys.</v>

515
00:25:28.730 --> 00:25:32.510
<v Speaker 1>You don't know who's still wonky with </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to me earlier about infinity,</v>

516
00:25:32.511 --> 00:25:37.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you get an infinite number of </v>

517
00:25:37.511 --> 00:25:37.511
<v Speaker 1>monkeys aren't there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the same animal,</v>

518
00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:40.730
<v Speaker 1>so the same exact animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to type the exact works of</v>

519
00:25:40.731 --> 00:25:43.880
<v Speaker 1>shakespeare that they will because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an infinite number of nuts.</v>

520
00:25:43.890 --> 00:25:47.030
<v Speaker 1>Every possible combination of less </v>
<v Speaker 1>oppressive must happen.</v>

521
00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:49.670
<v Speaker 1>Dan is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would it happen?</v>

522
00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:54.700
<v Speaker 1>What is the odds of it happening in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exact same order of the works of </v>

523
00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:56.630
<v Speaker 1>shakespeare isn't even calculus than </v>
<v Speaker 1>zero.</v>

524
00:25:57.020 --> 00:26:02.020
<v Speaker 1>Less than zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but integrated in there so that if </v>

525
00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:03.460
<v Speaker 1>you've got an infinite number of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then,</v>

526
00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.080
<v Speaker 1>then you will get everything that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly happen.</v>

527
00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:11.320
<v Speaker 1>Will happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could you imagine if one monkey just </v>

528
00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:11.320
<v Speaker 1>randomly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they gave it a key,</v>

529
00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.340
<v Speaker 1>you know what we're talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire universe,</v>

530
00:26:13.341 --> 00:26:18.341
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're talking about an infinite </v>

531
00:26:18.341 --> 00:26:19.421
<v Speaker 1>number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what if they just get lucky as fuck </v>

532
00:26:19.421 --> 00:26:21.560
<v Speaker 1>and give one monkey a typewriter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this little dude just starts banging out</v>

533
00:26:21.561 --> 00:26:24.200
<v Speaker 1>the entire works of shakespeare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's still a monkey.</v>

534
00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:26.870
<v Speaker 1>He's stIll like playing with his butt </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

535
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:31.950
<v Speaker 1>swInging around and having a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not doing anything else other than </v>

536
00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:32.720
<v Speaker 1>when they put them in front of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>keyboard.</v>

537
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:36.200
<v Speaker 1>He types out all the works of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shakespeare in exactly the right order,</v>

538
00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:39.650
<v Speaker 1>the exact punctuatIon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the exact spaces in between letters.</v>

539
00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:42.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the universe is infinite,</v>

540
00:26:42.990 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 1>which it may</v>

541
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.480
<v Speaker 2>well be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

542
00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:48.600
<v Speaker 2>there are many ways the universe can be </v>
<v Speaker 2>infinite,</v>

543
00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.310
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

544
00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:55.340
<v Speaker 2>that would happen because everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is in accord with the laws of </v>

545
00:26:55.711 --> 00:26:57.900
<v Speaker 2>physics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then it can happen.</v>

546
00:26:58.200 --> 00:27:03.200
<v Speaker 2>And everything that can happen in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>infinite universe will happen because </v>

547
00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:06.600
<v Speaker 2>the universe is formerly infinite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I contend,</v>

548
00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:11.660
<v Speaker 2>and we'll probably get emails about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to think whether there's any </v>

549
00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:11.660
<v Speaker 2>counter argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there is.</v>

550
00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:15.771
<v Speaker 2>I contend that in an infinite universe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the most unlIkely possibility must </v>

551
00:27:15.961 --> 00:27:20.961
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact formally an infinite number of </v>

552
00:27:20.961 --> 00:27:21.240
<v Speaker 2>times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maybe shakespeare,</v>

553
00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:23.460
<v Speaker 3>a monkey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just looked.</v>

554
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.960
<v Speaker 3>Maybe if someone's pet monkey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can imagine.</v>

555
00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:27.800
<v Speaker 3>We can calculate it</v>

556
00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:33.960
<v Speaker 2>when someone can do it online now </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there are how many letters are </v>

557
00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.050
<v Speaker 2>there in shakespeare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the complete works of shakespeare so you</v>

558
00:27:36.051 --> 00:27:41.051
<v Speaker 2>can google that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone will tell you and we know 26 </v>

559
00:27:41.051 --> 00:27:41.630
<v Speaker 2>possibilities and so off we go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so,</v>

560
00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:44.120
<v Speaker 2>so how?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the probability?</v>

561
00:27:44.121 --> 00:27:47.310
<v Speaker 2>What are the odds of randomly typing on </v>
<v Speaker 2>site writer,</v>

562
00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:52.770
<v Speaker 2>let's say at one letter per second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long will it take and what are the </v>

563
00:27:52.770 --> 00:27:53.750
<v Speaker 2>odds that your type out the complete </v>
<v Speaker 2>works of shakespeare?</v>

564
00:27:53.751 --> 00:27:56.510
<v Speaker 2>That's a no number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know where my head,</v>

565
00:27:56.511 --> 00:28:01.511
<v Speaker 2>but it can be calculated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's my challenge to your viewers </v>

566
00:28:01.511 --> 00:28:02.660
<v Speaker 2>and listeners sending that email.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone will do it.</v>

567
00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:05.030
<v Speaker 2>There'll be someone working at mit or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

568
00:28:05.031 --> 00:28:06.980
<v Speaker 2>you can do it in five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an easy song</v>

569
00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:12.200
<v Speaker 3>and then you'd have to calculate how </v>
<v Speaker 3>many monkeys start out with romeo and </v>

570
00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.060
<v Speaker 3>juliet and then just start shitting on </v>
<v Speaker 3>their typewriter.</v>

571
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:18.350
<v Speaker 3>That I.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know the answer to that is more than </v>

572
00:28:18.350 --> 00:28:20.760
<v Speaker 3>the other ones and the first chapter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Perfect.</v>

573
00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:24.630
<v Speaker 3>And then just shit all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The last word.</v>

574
00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:26.700
<v Speaker 3>The last single digit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

575
00:28:26.701 --> 00:28:31.701
<v Speaker 3>I bet every keystroke along the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a monkey shitting on their </v>

576
00:28:31.701 --> 00:28:32.520
<v Speaker 3>typewriter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you get like the first paragraph.</v>

577
00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:35.280
<v Speaker 3>Shit all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy got to the second paragraph.</v>

578
00:28:35.281 --> 00:28:35.790
<v Speaker 3>Shit all over it.</v>

579
00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:40.850
<v Speaker 2>Place to go back to having a monkey cage</v>
<v Speaker 2>complaint letter that proves that </v>

580
00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:40.850
<v Speaker 2>darwin's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

581
00:28:42.210 --> 00:28:43.980
<v Speaker 2>that's the Logic that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

582
00:28:43.981 --> 00:28:45.570
<v Speaker 2>Can I just say that if someone doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember,</v>

583
00:28:45.571 --> 00:28:47.540
<v Speaker 2>I just came into the podcast at that </v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

584
00:28:47.541 --> 00:28:47.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

585
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:49.320
<v Speaker 3>No he doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

586
00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:51.210
<v Speaker 3>you can't cherry pick that quote.</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

587
00:28:51.211 --> 00:28:53.340
<v Speaker 3>Just Brian Cox has nothing darwin's </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>

588
00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:57.210
<v Speaker 3>That'll be in the press.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a great website,</v>

589
00:28:57.240 --> 00:29:02.240
<v Speaker 3>a twitter handle called take that darwin</v>
<v Speaker 3>where people that are educationally </v>

590
00:29:03.061 --> 00:29:06.210
<v Speaker 3>challenged will question darwin's </v>
<v Speaker 3>theories like that.</v>

591
00:29:06.211 --> 00:29:07.690
<v Speaker 3>My favorite one is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

592
00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:13.040
<v Speaker 3>people came from monkeys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Monkeys are still around like dave </v>

593
00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:15.510
<v Speaker 3>retweet that all day because someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>adjust that fundamental misunderstanding</v>

594
00:29:15.511 --> 00:29:17.580
<v Speaker 3>of evolution that that really is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

595
00:29:17.581 --> 00:29:20.250
<v Speaker 3>you're going right where I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 3>start maybe with the book.</v>

596
00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:25.520
<v Speaker 3>The only wAy to truly test is to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we'll really need to do is take </v>

597
00:29:25.520 --> 00:29:28.620
<v Speaker 3>monkeys and give them psychedelic drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to do this.</v>

598
00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:33.680
<v Speaker 3>Someone needs to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't need to take an island where the </v>

599
00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:34.380
<v Speaker 3>monkeys can't escape and give them </v>
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic drugs and leave them puzzles</v>

600
00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:39.560
<v Speaker 3>and see what they figured out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why does that test anything doesn't.</v>

601
00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:41.980
<v Speaker 3>I would just be fun</v>

602
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.980
<v Speaker 1>to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a.</v>

603
00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:48.990
<v Speaker 1>A guy named terrence mckenna who I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 1>huge fan of who had a a theory called </v>

604
00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:51.100
<v Speaker 1>the stoned ape theory and he backed it </v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

605
00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:56.160
<v Speaker 1>allegedly remember who this is coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a with climate to logical data on </v>

606
00:29:56.950 --> 00:30:01.950
<v Speaker 1>that time of the world that he believes </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the evolution of human beings,</v>

607
00:30:03.910 --> 00:30:07.240
<v Speaker 1>the a big part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the development of the human brain might</v>

608
00:30:07.241 --> 00:30:10.690
<v Speaker 1>have come from them experimenting with </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic mushrooms.</v>

609
00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:13.810
<v Speaker 1>That as the rain forest receded into </v>
<v Speaker 1>grasslands,</v>

610
00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:19.140
<v Speaker 1>animals were forced to try new foods out</v>
<v Speaker 1>because their habitat was changing and </v>

611
00:30:19.211 --> 00:30:24.211
<v Speaker 1>they would climb down for these trees </v>
<v Speaker 1>and flip over these cow patties to get </v>

612
00:30:24.211 --> 00:30:27.310
<v Speaker 1>bugs and worms and things along those </v>
<v Speaker 1>lines and that this time of the world,</v>

613
00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:32.580
<v Speaker 1>it was very common to have these </v>
<v Speaker 1>psilocybin mushrooms growing all over </v>

614
00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:32.860
<v Speaker 1>the place and that the monkeys that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would eat them,</v>

615
00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:38.010
<v Speaker 1>he had a bunch of theories like </v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently it's been proven that in low </v>

616
00:30:38.010 --> 00:30:40.450
<v Speaker 1>doses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psilocybin increases visual acuity,</v>

617
00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:42.640
<v Speaker 1>which would make you able to see things </v>
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>

618
00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:47.820
<v Speaker 1>which would make you a better hunter </v>
<v Speaker 1>also makes you horny so it would make </v>

619
00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:51.931
<v Speaker 1>people more likely to breed and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would favor the people or the monkeys </v>

620
00:30:51.931 --> 00:30:51.931
<v Speaker 1>rather.</v>

621
00:30:51.931 --> 00:30:53.650
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the subhuman primates,</v>

622
00:30:53.651 --> 00:30:56.650
<v Speaker 1>whatever you call them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that that went along that line.</v>

623
00:30:56.770 --> 00:31:01.770
<v Speaker 1>What is it is one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will I be accepted theories about </v>

624
00:31:01.770 --> 00:31:05.740
<v Speaker 1>hominid evolution is that is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>climate change played a key role and </v>

625
00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:09.130
<v Speaker 1>actually there's in my life to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>receiving universe,</v>

626
00:31:09.131 --> 00:31:13.000
<v Speaker 1>we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We focused on a a theory which links the</v>

627
00:31:13.001 --> 00:31:18.001
<v Speaker 1>climate change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly in the rift valley because </v>

628
00:31:18.001 --> 00:31:20.340
<v Speaker 1>we know that the big jumps in brain size</v>
<v Speaker 1>all occurred and enriched valley of </v>

629
00:31:20.340 --> 00:31:23.320
<v Speaker 1>africa and it's quite remarkable </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually and that that broadly speaking,</v>

630
00:31:23.321 --> 00:31:28.321
<v Speaker 1>accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think although I love argument with </v>

631
00:31:28.321 --> 00:31:28.321
<v Speaker 1>anthropologists because the dates or his</v>
<v Speaker 1>spouse,</v>

632
00:31:28.321 --> 00:31:33.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's broadly accepted that and it </v>

633
00:31:33.090 --> 00:31:35.281
<v Speaker 1>seems that the big gym sitting in brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>size occurred at times when the soul </v>

634
00:31:35.281 --> 00:31:38.250
<v Speaker 1>bates was most elliptical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the slb oscillates.</v>

635
00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:43.260
<v Speaker 1>It becomes more elliptical than most </v>
<v Speaker 1>circular and there are many different </v>

636
00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:45.781
<v Speaker 1>oscillations driven by gravitational </v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction with the planets like </v>

637
00:31:45.781 --> 00:31:49.171
<v Speaker 1>jupiter in particular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it seems like when the ssl based </v>

638
00:31:49.171 --> 00:31:52.240
<v Speaker 1>mostly elliptical the the rate of </v>
<v Speaker 1>climate change and the rift valley is </v>

639
00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:56.700
<v Speaker 1>higher and more extreme and it seems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be the case that this relatively strong </v>

640
00:31:58.151 --> 00:32:03.151
<v Speaker 1>evidence for the case that when you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>these rapid times of climate change you </v>

641
00:32:03.151 --> 00:32:06.541
<v Speaker 1>mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you get increases in hominin brain </v>

642
00:32:06.541 --> 00:32:09.631
<v Speaker 1>size and therefore increase in </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence is a big wig at one point </v>

643
00:32:09.631 --> 00:32:09.631
<v Speaker 1>eight.</v>

644
00:32:09.631 --> 00:32:13.350
<v Speaker 1>One point 8 million years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a very big increase in the </v>

645
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:16.480
<v Speaker 1>number of species in the rift valley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of which homo erectus was one of them,</v>

646
00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:21.160
<v Speaker 1>which eventually led to us and a big a </v>
<v Speaker 1>big jump in brain size as well,</v>

647
00:32:21.161 --> 00:32:24.880
<v Speaker 1>and this was at a time when there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong evidence for rapid climate change</v>

648
00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:25.990
<v Speaker 1>in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that region.</v>

649
00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:31.260
<v Speaker 1>So that makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the adaptability of these animals </v>

650
00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:32.950
<v Speaker 1>experimented with new food sources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying out new hunting methods.</v>

651
00:32:33.130 --> 00:32:35.140
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of them changed from herbivore,</v>

652
00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:37.900
<v Speaker 1>omnivore a lot of the primates that were</v>
<v Speaker 1>observed.</v>

653
00:32:37.901 --> 00:32:38.500
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

654
00:32:38.650 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 1>That's where it gets controversial</v>

655
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:43.660
<v Speaker 2>when you look at the academic research </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the what,</v>

656
00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:48.880
<v Speaker 2>so you the darwinian idea that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you get this pressure from climate </v>

657
00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.930
<v Speaker 2>change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then what's the selection effect?</v>

658
00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:53.510
<v Speaker 2>Because climaTe change happens over many</v>
<v Speaker 2>generations,</v>

659
00:32:53.511 --> 00:32:55.550
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't happen over one generation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

660
00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:56.630
<v Speaker 2>so the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

661
00:32:56.631 --> 00:32:59.270
<v Speaker 2>what actually is doing the selecting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are we selecting for?</v>

662
00:32:59.271 --> 00:33:04.271
<v Speaker 2>Why is this group I'm more likely to </v>
<v Speaker 2>breed and be more successful if it's </v>

663
00:33:04.271 --> 00:33:05.510
<v Speaker 2>more intelligent?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So some people say,</v>

664
00:33:05.511 --> 00:33:07.580
<v Speaker 2>well it's because we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were forced into groups,</v>

665
00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:11.480
<v Speaker 2>so it's group dynamics is the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you end up with bigger tribes,</v>

666
00:33:11.481 --> 00:33:16.481
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of individuals cooperating </v>

667
00:33:16.481 --> 00:33:18.371
<v Speaker 2>together and that's what's been selected</v>
<v Speaker 2>for and you need to be intelligent for </v>

668
00:33:18.371 --> 00:33:18.371
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people say as you said,</v>

669
00:33:18.371 --> 00:33:23.021
<v Speaker 2>that it's more adaptability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maybe they have to learn to go </v>

670
00:33:23.021 --> 00:33:26.381
<v Speaker 2>fishing or they have to learn to eat a </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular different crops and then </v>

671
00:33:26.381 --> 00:33:26.381
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's.</v>

672
00:33:26.381 --> 00:33:28.600
<v Speaker 2>So that's a big area of debate about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what might have been the,</v>

673
00:33:28.601 --> 00:33:30.410
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the selection pressure,</v>

674
00:33:30.411 --> 00:33:33.680
<v Speaker 2>this precise selection pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it does seem pretty nAiled down that</v>

675
00:33:33.681 --> 00:33:37.130
<v Speaker 2>climate change certainly in that region </v>
<v Speaker 2>of africa,</v>

676
00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:42.160
<v Speaker 2>in Ethiopia and Tanzania and through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>rift valley had played a role in driving</v>

677
00:33:42.381 --> 00:33:44.590
<v Speaker 2>us towards intelligence and essentially </v>
<v Speaker 2>shape scales.</v>

678
00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:45.620
<v Speaker 2>Very small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way.</v>

679
00:33:45.621 --> 00:33:50.621
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you go back 4 million years and </v>

680
00:33:50.621 --> 00:33:51.830
<v Speaker 2>you'll.</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like australopithecus are around.</v>

681
00:33:51.831 --> 00:33:53.660
<v Speaker 2>We should basically outright </v>
<v Speaker 2>chimpanzees.</v>

682
00:33:53.720 --> 00:33:55.850
<v Speaker 2>The brain is not much bigger than a </v>
<v Speaker 2>modern day chimp.</v>

683
00:33:56.390 --> 00:34:01.390
<v Speaker 2>But then you go to 200,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago and that's when homosapiens </v>

684
00:34:01.390 --> 00:34:02.990
<v Speaker 2>first emerge and just over 200,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

685
00:34:02.991 --> 00:34:06.140
<v Speaker 2>which is not very long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's quite remarkable actually,</v>

686
00:34:06.290 --> 00:34:11.290
<v Speaker 2>and that the modern theories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get spread out of africa that </v>

687
00:34:11.290 --> 00:34:14.381
<v Speaker 2>60,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago and they made it into europe </v>

688
00:34:14.381 --> 00:34:17.201
<v Speaker 2>about 43,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago also into north America and </v>

689
00:34:17.201 --> 00:34:18.020
<v Speaker 2>south America only 15,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

690
00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:20.900
<v Speaker 2>So it's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite a rapid spread.</v>

691
00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:26.200
<v Speaker 2>And the fact that we've only been around</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a species for at most a quarter of a </v>

692
00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:30.820
<v Speaker 2>million years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a quarter of 1 million years is quite </v>

693
00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:30.820
<v Speaker 2>remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

694
00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:33.780
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you think about what we've </v>

695
00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:33.780
<v Speaker 4>accomplished,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was flying into los angeles last night</v>

696
00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:37.820
<v Speaker 4>and I was thinking if you could take the</v>
<v Speaker 4>pioneers that came from europe in the 17</v>

697
00:34:39.071 --> 00:34:44.071
<v Speaker 4>and 18 hundreds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guys who were on those wagons with </v>

698
00:34:44.071 --> 00:34:47.911
<v Speaker 4>the wooden wheels and they're pulling </v>
<v Speaker 4>them with horses across the country </v>

699
00:34:47.911 --> 00:34:49.030
<v Speaker 4>trying to see what's over there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you could show them like,</v>

700
00:34:49.031 --> 00:34:54.031
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what's going to go down in 2015 </v>

701
00:34:54.031 --> 00:34:54.031
<v Speaker 4>hop on this plane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look out this window.</v>

702
00:34:54.031 --> 00:34:55.330
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at that grid.</v>

703
00:34:55.630 --> 00:34:59.410
<v Speaker 4>TheY would freak the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They saw all the electricity.</v>

704
00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:02.740
<v Speaker 4>That's the sky of los angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in my opinion.</v>

705
00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:07.800
<v Speaker 4>Los angeles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>More beautiful at night than any other </v>

706
00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.540
<v Speaker 4>city because it's so spread out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's all lights as you're flying in.</v>

707
00:35:09.541 --> 00:35:11.530
<v Speaker 4>It looks so science fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

708
00:35:11.531 --> 00:35:11.940
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

709
00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:12.250
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

710
00:35:12.350 --> 00:35:15.710
<v Speaker 2>recently interviewed the astronaut </v>
<v Speaker 2>charlie duke who landed on the moon,</v>

711
00:35:15.790 --> 00:35:17.770
<v Speaker 2>the apollo astronauts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said to me,</v>

712
00:35:17.820 --> 00:35:20.690
<v Speaker 2>his father couldn't believe it because </v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

713
00:35:20.691 --> 00:35:23.140
<v Speaker 2>he was alive when the wright brothers </v>
<v Speaker 2>flew.</v>

714
00:35:23.630 --> 00:35:28.630
<v Speaker 2>So he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his father's spanned the time from the </v>

715
00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:29.330
<v Speaker 2>wright brothers to an,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was alive and then he,</v>

716
00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:33.640
<v Speaker 2>some walked on the moon in one lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>60 years.</v>

717
00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:34.690
<v Speaker 2>Seventy years.</v>

718
00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:37.500
<v Speaker 4>The real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the real mind fuck is</v>

719
00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:43.140
<v Speaker 1>with the creation of the plane to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time someone dropped an atomic bomb from</v>

720
00:35:43.141 --> 00:35:45.230
<v Speaker 1>the plane is less than 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

721
00:35:45.250 --> 00:35:47.910
<v Speaker 1>And the nuclear physics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't know.</v>

722
00:35:48.270 --> 00:35:51.690
<v Speaker 1>We didn't know there was an italian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rutherford discovered the atomic nucleus</v>

723
00:35:51.691 --> 00:35:55.920
<v Speaker 1>in manchester in a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it 1912 or so?</v>

724
00:35:55.930 --> 00:35:56.880
<v Speaker 1>I should know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>

725
00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:57.990
<v Speaker 1>17,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

726
00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:03.170
<v Speaker 1>12 and 13.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he discovers the nucleus and within </v>

727
00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:05.370
<v Speaker 1>30 years you have an atomic bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't even know.</v>

728
00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:10.500
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and rutherford we actually asked at the </v>

729
00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:10.500
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>

730
00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:10.500
<v Speaker 1>it's the usual question we get as </v>
<v Speaker 1>physicists.</v>

731
00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:11.730
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the use of this?</v>

732
00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:12.960
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

733
00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.970
<v Speaker 1>and rutherford said that there's no use </v>
<v Speaker 1>to it.</v>

734
00:36:14.971 --> 00:36:19.971
<v Speaker 1>You said anyone who thinks that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could use this as an energy source is </v>

735
00:36:19.971 --> 00:36:22.701
<v Speaker 1>talking moonshine and within 30 or 40 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years you have nuclear reactors </v>

736
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:25.530
<v Speaker 1>producing power and you have atomic </v>
<v Speaker 1>bombs.</v>

737
00:36:25.670 --> 00:36:28.140
<v Speaker 1>A rapid rapid progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

738
00:36:28.141 --> 00:36:32.020
<v Speaker 1>that's one thing that's been constant </v>
<v Speaker 1>about people and predicting the future.</v>

739
00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:33.990
<v Speaker 1>And we've always got it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

740
00:36:33.991 --> 00:36:34.270
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

741
00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:36.810
<v Speaker 1>we miss some of the rapid advances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

742
00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:37.630
<v Speaker 1>we talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

743
00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:42.710
<v Speaker 1>there's a computer on a phone here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the fact that the modern </v>

744
00:36:42.901 --> 00:36:46.290
<v Speaker 1>electronics is a single lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The transistor is what,</v>

745
00:36:46.291 --> 00:36:51.291
<v Speaker 1>19 forties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think bell labs here in the us not </v>

746
00:36:51.291 --> 00:36:52.920
<v Speaker 1>long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that you go from that to this.</v>

747
00:36:53.130 --> 00:36:58.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean we talked about the apollo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is significantly more </v>

748
00:36:58.130 --> 00:37:01.131
<v Speaker 1>powerful than anything that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>available in the world when apollo was </v>

749
00:37:01.131 --> 00:37:04.971
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The room rooms filled with computers at </v>

750
00:37:04.971 --> 00:37:08.721
<v Speaker 1>nasa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we're nowhere near as powerful as </v>

751
00:37:08.721 --> 00:37:08.721
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing.</v>

752
00:37:08.721 --> 00:37:11.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's those google glasses that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are wearing is a sign of things </v>

753
00:37:11.330 --> 00:37:11.910
<v Speaker 1>to come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In my opinion,</v>

754
00:37:11.911 --> 00:37:12.870
<v Speaker 1>they just stopped making them.</v>

755
00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:18.230
<v Speaker 1>But there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a new company that has like a </v>

756
00:37:18.230 --> 00:37:21.021
<v Speaker 1>goggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a skiing goggle and it </v>

757
00:37:21.021 --> 00:37:21.570
<v Speaker 1>allows you to move things in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>you like a virtual desktop.</v>

758
00:37:21.571 --> 00:37:24.270
<v Speaker 1>You can spin squares,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold things in place,</v>

759
00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:26.340
<v Speaker 1>throw things to the side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they disappear.</v>

760
00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:27.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

761
00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:28.800
<v Speaker 1>we're going to get really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

762
00:37:28.801 --> 00:37:31.350
<v Speaker 1>really weird within the next couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>decades.</v>

763
00:37:31.950 --> 00:37:36.950
<v Speaker 1>I've actually seen some of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology is a company called magic </v>

764
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:37.590
<v Speaker 1>leap and I've been there in miami.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you saw it in person.</v>

765
00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:40.230
<v Speaker 1>What does it look really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does indeed.</v>

766
00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:40.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

767
00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:43.710
<v Speaker 1>you can put three d objects into your </v>
<v Speaker 1>field of vision.</v>

768
00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:45.630
<v Speaker 1>So how is that working?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've,</v>

769
00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:47.480
<v Speaker 1>you've actually seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

770
00:37:48.030 --> 00:37:48.930
<v Speaker 1>dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't talk,</v>

771
00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:52.300
<v Speaker 1>but I'll tell you that it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a remarkable thing about google.</v>

772
00:37:52.301 --> 00:37:53.590
<v Speaker 1>It just bought the company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually we,</v>

773
00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.020
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we played it.</v>

774
00:37:55.080 --> 00:38:00.080
<v Speaker 1>We played some videos of it and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't figure out whether we were </v>

775
00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:00.080
<v Speaker 1>watching a simulation.</v>

776
00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:04.670
<v Speaker 1>We're watching what the future holds or </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're watching an actual demonstration </v>

777
00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:04.810
<v Speaker 1>of that technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

778
00:38:04.890 --> 00:38:06.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be impressive.</v>

779
00:38:06.271 --> 00:38:11.271
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's interesting what You said </v>

780
00:38:11.271 --> 00:38:11.271
<v Speaker 1>because it brings the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

781
00:38:11.271 --> 00:38:11.271
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

782
00:38:11.271 --> 00:38:14.590
<v Speaker 1>the web this limited information into </v>
<v Speaker 1>your field of vision so you can </v>

783
00:38:14.590 --> 00:38:16.470
<v Speaker 1>manipulate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there are questions about,</v>

784
00:38:16.471 --> 00:38:18.870
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's real and what isn't and who,</v>

785
00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:20.400
<v Speaker 1>who cares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

786
00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:22.850
<v Speaker 1>really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's so interest.</v>

787
00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:27.960
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you dabble at all in the theory of </v>

788
00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:30.240
<v Speaker 1>some sort of an artificial world that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>live in,</v>

789
00:38:30.450 --> 00:38:33.960
<v Speaker 1>these ideas of simulation do dabble in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that or is it just too much?</v>

790
00:38:33.961 --> 00:38:34.800
<v Speaker 1>And actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>

791
00:38:34.801 --> 00:38:35.220
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

792
00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:35.650
<v Speaker 1>a</v>

793
00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.250
<v Speaker 2>colleague of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned,</v>

794
00:38:37.251 --> 00:38:41.620
<v Speaker 2>there are some physicists who you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's a possibility,</v>

795
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:44.110
<v Speaker 2>a strong possibility that we're living </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a simulation.</v>

796
00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:45.430
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>

797
00:38:45.490 --> 00:38:47.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's speculative out their stuff,</v>

798
00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:52.110
<v Speaker 2>but it's an attempt to explain some </v>
<v Speaker 2>properties of the universe that are,</v>

799
00:38:52.130 --> 00:38:54.850
<v Speaker 2>that are interesting and unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

800
00:38:54.890 --> 00:38:57.640
<v Speaker 2>so one of my favorite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think at the moment,</v>

801
00:38:57.641 --> 00:39:00.220
<v Speaker 2>piece of cutting edge physics and </v>
<v Speaker 2>cosmology,</v>

802
00:39:00.280 --> 00:39:01.180
<v Speaker 2>cosmology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should say,</v>

803
00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:04.380
<v Speaker 2>the study of the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the origin and evolution of the universe</v>

804
00:39:04.381 --> 00:39:07.030
<v Speaker 2>is going through a revolution at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment and he's coming from data.</v>

805
00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:12.270
<v Speaker 2>So it's coming from measurements of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things like the cosmic microwave </v>

806
00:39:12.270 --> 00:39:15.421
<v Speaker 2>background radiation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the oldest light in the </v>

807
00:39:15.421 --> 00:39:15.421
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're making it.</v>

808
00:39:15.421 --> 00:39:18.520
<v Speaker 2>So just to rewind and say what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And 380,000</v>

809
00:39:18.521 --> 00:39:23.521
<v Speaker 2>years after the big bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the universe became transparent for the </v>

810
00:39:23.521 --> 00:39:23.521
<v Speaker 2>first time to light.</v>

811
00:39:23.521 --> 00:39:28.440
<v Speaker 2>And that's because it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was cooling down as he would </v>

812
00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:28.440
<v Speaker 2>expanding and cooling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then atoms formed,</v>

813
00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:31.210
<v Speaker 2>it became cool enough for atoms to form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And at that moment,</v>

814
00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:33.040
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very quickly,</v>

815
00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:38.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the universe becomes transparent and so </v>

816
00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:40.351
<v Speaker 2>photons of light can travel on through </v>
<v Speaker 2>the universe and they've been doing so </v>

817
00:39:40.351 --> 00:39:40.960
<v Speaker 2>ever since.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we can take a photograph of that.</v>

818
00:39:40.990 --> 00:39:43.300
<v Speaker 2>And we have done with a series of </v>
<v Speaker 2>satellites,</v>

819
00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:45.400
<v Speaker 2>the most recent of which is called </v>
<v Speaker 2>plank,</v>

820
00:39:45.430 --> 00:39:46.960
<v Speaker 2>which is european satellite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This up there.</v>

821
00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:51.550
<v Speaker 2>So this is a picture of baby picture of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the universe as it was 380,000</v>

822
00:39:51.551 --> 00:39:53.980
<v Speaker 2>years after the big bang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's very beautiful picture,</v>

823
00:39:54.490 --> 00:39:59.490
<v Speaker 2>but in explaining that a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's given support to theories called </v>

824
00:39:59.490 --> 00:40:03.511
<v Speaker 2>inflationary cosmology theories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So inflationary cosmology theories say </v>

825
00:40:03.511 --> 00:40:06.400
<v Speaker 2>that before the universe was hot and </v>
<v Speaker 2>dense,</v>

826
00:40:06.460 --> 00:40:08.950
<v Speaker 2>which we tend to call the big bang </v>
<v Speaker 2>before that,</v>

827
00:40:08.951 --> 00:40:13.951
<v Speaker 2>the universe was still there and he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing something else which was an </v>

828
00:40:13.951 --> 00:40:13.951
<v Speaker 2>exponential expansion.</v>

829
00:40:13.951 --> 00:40:17.080
<v Speaker 2>So it was expanding exponentially fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way faster than the speed of light.</v>

830
00:40:17.350 --> 00:40:22.350
<v Speaker 2>Then it stops and all the energy that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was causing that expansion gets dumped </v>

831
00:40:22.350 --> 00:40:23.080
<v Speaker 2>into space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heats it up,</v>

832
00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:26.320
<v Speaker 2>and that's what we see as the particles </v>
<v Speaker 2>and energy today.</v>

833
00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:28.460
<v Speaker 2>So those theories are kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested,</v>

834
00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:34.050
<v Speaker 2>but they also suggest there are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are things called eternal </v>

835
00:40:34.050 --> 00:40:38.581
<v Speaker 2>inflation theories that say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well how long did that period of </v>

836
00:40:38.581 --> 00:40:39.310
<v Speaker 2>expansion go on for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And does it all stop at one?</v>

837
00:40:39.311 --> 00:40:42.370
<v Speaker 2>So does it stop in patches?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if it stops in patches,</v>

838
00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:45.880
<v Speaker 2>you get it stopped a little patch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd get a big bang in the universe and</v>

839
00:40:45.881 --> 00:40:48.320
<v Speaker 2>it starts another patch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get another big bang the universe,</v>

840
00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:54.070
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so these theories suggest perhaps there </v>

841
00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:56.770
<v Speaker 2>were an infinite number possibly have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>big banks in inverted commerce,</v>

842
00:40:56.890 --> 00:41:00.070
<v Speaker 2>which would mean there are an infinite </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of universities like ours and,</v>

843
00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:05.380
<v Speaker 2>and they're beIng created now all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time and they will continue to be </v>

844
00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:05.380
<v Speaker 2>created ever.</v>

845
00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:09.460
<v Speaker 2>so you get this fractal multiverse ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>growing exponentially fast.</v>

846
00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:14.820
<v Speaker 2>And really bizarrely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that those theories have some support </v>

847
00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:15.850
<v Speaker 2>from the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the cosmic microwave background.</v>

848
00:41:15.870 --> 00:41:18.040
<v Speaker 2>There are theories that explain the </v>
<v Speaker 2>structures we see.</v>

849
00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:21.610
<v Speaker 2>I should just underline the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is speculative in a sentence,</v>

850
00:41:21.611 --> 00:41:22.630
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's um,</v>

851
00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:27.390
<v Speaker 2>but it's relatively mainstream that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But one of my colleagues noticed,</v>

852
00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:32.490
<v Speaker 2>some physicists have noticed is if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>were some kind of omnipotent deity </v>

853
00:41:32.490 --> 00:41:36.260
<v Speaker 2>programmer and you want it to run what's</v>
<v Speaker 2>called a monte carlo simulation to say,</v>

854
00:41:36.261 --> 00:41:38.900
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll vary the strength of gravity in one</v>

855
00:41:38.901 --> 00:41:41.270
<v Speaker 2>universe and vary the massive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the electron and another one.</v>

856
00:41:41.271 --> 00:41:46.271
<v Speaker 2>I'm very these physical constants and </v>
<v Speaker 2>see what happens then this is probably </v>

857
00:41:46.271 --> 00:41:50.291
<v Speaker 2>this kind of thing you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what he would kind of look like </v>

858
00:41:50.291 --> 00:41:53.890
<v Speaker 2>so that you can make an argument that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the universe in some sense looks like </v>

859
00:41:54.261 --> 00:41:59.261
<v Speaker 2>one of these kinds of so called monte </v>
<v Speaker 2>carlo simulations because it gives you </v>

860
00:41:59.261 --> 00:42:03.221
<v Speaker 2>the possibility of generating every </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible number of different ratio to </v>

861
00:42:04.021 --> 00:42:06.290
<v Speaker 2>the strengths of the forces of nature </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all these things.</v>

862
00:42:06.490 --> 00:42:10.130
<v Speaker 2>So I just have to emphasize this is way </v>
<v Speaker 2>out there way on the edge,</v>

863
00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:15.340
<v Speaker 2>but it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what is fun and interesting though </v>

864
00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:17.910
<v Speaker 2>is it the wind all the way back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the inflationary cosmology bit is,</v>

865
00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:22.920
<v Speaker 2>is probably the most widely accepted </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory at the moment for how the </v>

866
00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:26.470
<v Speaker 2>universe got to be the way it is and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>does lend itself to this idea that there</v>

867
00:42:26.471 --> 00:42:28.840
<v Speaker 2>may be a multiverse and and it may be </v>
<v Speaker 2>that in,</v>

868
00:42:28.880 --> 00:42:31.070
<v Speaker 2>in each different pocket universe if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd like.</v>

869
00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:32.810
<v Speaker 2>You can have different physical </v>
<v Speaker 2>constants.</v>

870
00:42:32.900 --> 00:42:34.940
<v Speaker 2>So most of them wouldn't allow life to </v>
<v Speaker 2>exist.</v>

871
00:42:35.330 --> 00:42:38.910
<v Speaker 2>But some of them would say our universe </v>
<v Speaker 2>looks very fine tuned.</v>

872
00:42:38.911 --> 00:42:43.280
<v Speaker 2>and if you look at it in a sense it </v>
<v Speaker 2>looks like that they belong with nature.</v>

873
00:42:43.281 --> 00:42:45.650
<v Speaker 2>We're very slightly different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't get carbon,</v>

874
00:42:45.651 --> 00:42:48.830
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>produced In stars in large quantities,</v>

875
00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:51.410
<v Speaker 2>which you need in order to the stars </v>
<v Speaker 2>die,</v>

876
00:42:51.411 --> 00:42:55.640
<v Speaker 2>the carbon and the oxygen come out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they rican lapse into another generation</v>

877
00:42:55.641 --> 00:42:58.550
<v Speaker 2>of stars and solar systems and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>how you get the heavy elements that make</v>

878
00:42:58.551 --> 00:43:02.390
<v Speaker 2>up our bodies and so all those things </v>
<v Speaker 2>look you need.</v>

879
00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:07.640
<v Speaker 2>You either try and find an explanation </v>
<v Speaker 2>for why the laws of nature of the way </v>

880
00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:11.711
<v Speaker 2>they are or you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go to one of these multiverse </v>

881
00:43:11.711 --> 00:43:15.611
<v Speaker 2>theories and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well actually goes back to what we </v>

882
00:43:15.611 --> 00:43:17.561
<v Speaker 2>talked about earlier about the infinite </v>
<v Speaker 2>monkeys and me actually every </v>

883
00:43:17.561 --> 00:43:18.110
<v Speaker 2>possibility occurs in nature and then we</v>
<v Speaker 2>shouldn't.</v>

884
00:43:18.111 --> 00:43:23.111
<v Speaker 2>Shouldn't be surprised that we live in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>universe that's seems fine tuned for </v>

885
00:43:23.111 --> 00:43:26.921
<v Speaker 2>life seems perfect for us to exist in </v>
<v Speaker 2>because every possible combination of </v>

886
00:43:27.031 --> 00:43:32.031
<v Speaker 2>the laws of nature exists somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is where cosmology is at the </v>

887
00:43:32.031 --> 00:43:32.390
<v Speaker 2>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this is genuine.</v>

888
00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:37.600
<v Speaker 2>You could go onto the web and google it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll find a thousand review papers on </v>

889
00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:41.180
<v Speaker 2>what's called an inflationary cosmology </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it is cool and interest in actually.</v>

890
00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:42.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's beyond that.</v>

891
00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:44.530
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very.</v>

892
00:43:45.460 --> 00:43:49.670
<v Speaker 3>The idea of something being infinite and</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just infinite,</v>

893
00:43:49.671 --> 00:43:52.030
<v Speaker 3>but infinite numbers of these infinite </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

894
00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:54.590
<v Speaker 3>infinite numbers of infinite </v>
<v Speaker 3>universities,</v>

895
00:43:54.950 --> 00:43:57.130
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these theories exist.</v>

896
00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:02.400
<v Speaker 3>So This idea of computer simulation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea that the world we live in,</v>

897
00:44:02.681 --> 00:44:07.681
<v Speaker 3>the universe we live in is a simulation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the question that you asked </v>

898
00:44:07.681 --> 00:44:09.220
<v Speaker 3>actually because we went on as </v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful.</v>

899
00:44:09.221 --> 00:44:10.900
<v Speaker 3>Don't change a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You stay you.</v>

900
00:44:12.610 --> 00:44:17.610
<v Speaker 3>The idea being that one day if human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings continue to increase our </v>

901
00:44:20.621 --> 00:44:23.140
<v Speaker 3>technological abilities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one day we're like,</v>

902
00:44:23.141 --> 00:44:28.141
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about this magic leap and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about the goggles that </v>

903
00:44:28.141 --> 00:44:30.190
<v Speaker 3>allow you to see a virtual world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to,</v>

904
00:44:30.250 --> 00:44:32.070
<v Speaker 3>if we don't ourselves up or get hit</v>

905
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:37.070
<v Speaker 1>by an asteroid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to come up with something </v>

906
00:44:37.070 --> 00:44:39.780
<v Speaker 1>that is indistinguishable from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality that we see right now.</v>

907
00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:45.560
<v Speaker 1>And when people start examining the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nature of the universe and they start </v>

908
00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:50.301
<v Speaker 1>looking at the fractal nature of things </v>
<v Speaker 1>and looking at like what you were </v>

909
00:44:50.301 --> 00:44:53.481
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you were going to be some </v>

910
00:44:53.481 --> 00:44:53.481
<v Speaker 1>omnipotent deity that creates the </v>
<v Speaker 1>university,</v>

911
00:44:53.481 --> 00:44:57.820
<v Speaker 1>probably do something like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like every single combination and throw </v>

912
00:44:57.820 --> 00:45:00.501
<v Speaker 1>them out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when we discover is is James Gates </v>

913
00:45:00.501 --> 00:45:03.550
<v Speaker 1>that was the guy's name investigates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>investigates.</v>

914
00:45:03.810 --> 00:45:08.810
<v Speaker 1>It was a guy who spoke to neil degrasse </v>
<v Speaker 1>tyson about string theory and that </v>

915
00:45:08.810 --> 00:45:12.801
<v Speaker 1>they've found in string theory the </v>
<v Speaker 1>computer code that was created by humans</v>

916
00:45:14.131 --> 00:45:19.131
<v Speaker 1>and like the 19 thirties they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They figured this out and that this </v>

917
00:45:19.131 --> 00:45:21.480
<v Speaker 1>actually exists in these codes in string</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory.</v>

918
00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:26.600
<v Speaker 1>and his idea was that that somehow </v>
<v Speaker 1>another proves that there is some </v>

919
00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:27.900
<v Speaker 1>evidence support that life.</v>

920
00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:30.630
<v Speaker 1>The reality that we see right now is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>simulation.</v>

921
00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:35.640
<v Speaker 1>Or it could be that which way more </v>
<v Speaker 1>likely that you're just discovering some</v>

922
00:45:35.641 --> 00:45:39.420
<v Speaker 1>sort of code that the entire universe is</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on.</v>

923
00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:44.660
<v Speaker 1>That.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you look at things being fractal </v>

924
00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:46.971
<v Speaker 1>and you look at the idea of there being </v>
<v Speaker 1>not just infinite expansion but infinite</v>

925
00:45:47.011 --> 00:45:49.620
<v Speaker 1>contraction and that there is no </v>
<v Speaker 1>smallest point.</v>

926
00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:51.930
<v Speaker 1>There's just smaller than we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>measure.</v>

927
00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:55.200
<v Speaker 1>But when we talk about subatomic </v>
<v Speaker 1>particles and we talk about things being</v>

928
00:45:55.350 --> 00:46:00.350
<v Speaker 1>like adam's being mostly air and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>you go deeper and deeper and you don't </v>

929
00:46:00.350 --> 00:46:03.861
<v Speaker 1>know what the fuck is going on and </v>
<v Speaker 1>particles are blinking in and out of </v>

930
00:46:03.861 --> 00:46:05.370
<v Speaker 1>existence and existing at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both moving and still la.</v>

931
00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:08.340
<v Speaker 1>but could it be that you just got to </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep going?</v>

932
00:46:08.370 --> 00:46:09.990
<v Speaker 1>We just can't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

933
00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:11.400
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the answer is,</v>

934
00:46:11.430 --> 00:46:13.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean we still have three know what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck's going on.</v>

935
00:46:13.450 --> 00:46:17.280
<v Speaker 1>Some level of political.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look to the lhc,</v>

936
00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:20.970
<v Speaker 1>the large hadron collider,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the place where we generate the</v>

937
00:46:20.971 --> 00:46:25.971
<v Speaker 1>highest energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's the biggest microscope in the </v>

938
00:46:25.971 --> 00:46:25.971
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In essence,</v>

939
00:46:25.971 --> 00:46:28.290
<v Speaker 1>we have an extremely good understanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the laws of physics at that level and</v>

940
00:46:28.810 --> 00:46:31.380
<v Speaker 1>up to and including the discovery of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>higgs particle.</v>

941
00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:34.500
<v Speaker 1>It's been proven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that debate at all the higgs?</v>

942
00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:39.510
<v Speaker 1>Because I remember there was some people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that were debating whether or not the </v>

943
00:46:39.510 --> 00:46:41.010
<v Speaker 1>higgs boson bows on the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a new,</v>

944
00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:46.080
<v Speaker 1>the analytical data that we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered and it has all the right </v>

945
00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:47.250
<v Speaker 1>properties to be the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The predicted standard model higgs,</v>

946
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:48.990
<v Speaker 1>politically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please explain what that means.</v>

947
00:46:49.510 --> 00:46:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Political.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was predicted back in the sixties.</v>

948
00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:52.720
<v Speaker 1>My pizza higgs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this man,</v>

949
00:46:52.830 --> 00:46:54.720
<v Speaker 1>his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's a.</v>

950
00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:59.190
<v Speaker 1>The idea is basically the early on in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the expansion history of the universe,</v>

951
00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:01.170
<v Speaker 1>so let's say less than a billionth of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>second,</v>

952
00:47:01.171 --> 00:47:03.930
<v Speaker 1>after the big bang as the universe </v>
<v Speaker 1>cooled,</v>

953
00:47:04.230 --> 00:47:07.680
<v Speaker 1>it went through something condensed out </v>
<v Speaker 1>into empty space.</v>

954
00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:09.790
<v Speaker 1>So if people call a phase transition </v>
<v Speaker 1>over,</v>

955
00:47:09.930 --> 00:47:12.910
<v Speaker 1>but it's analogous to a window pane on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cold winter's day.</v>

956
00:47:12.911 --> 00:47:17.911
<v Speaker 1>Die of cold winter days in la dia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you were to get ice on a window,</v>

957
00:47:19.620 --> 00:47:20.880
<v Speaker 1>it's analogous to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

958
00:47:20.881 --> 00:47:24.630
<v Speaker 1>it's a vapor condensing it into ice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you drop the temperature changes into</v>

959
00:47:24.631 --> 00:47:29.631
<v Speaker 1>something else to into eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the same way that the theory is </v>

960
00:47:29.631 --> 00:47:30.400
<v Speaker 1>that as the universe cooled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something condensed</v>

961
00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:31.990
<v Speaker 2>out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so empty space isn't empty.</v>

962
00:47:32.050 --> 00:47:34.900
<v Speaker 2>It's full of higgs particles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you like,</v>

963
00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:37.000
<v Speaker 2>or a higgs field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So every bit.</v>

964
00:47:37.001 --> 00:47:42.001
<v Speaker 2>So this means this space now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just space between the galaxies in </v>

965
00:47:42.001 --> 00:47:44.941
<v Speaker 2>this room that every square meter over </v>
<v Speaker 2>this room is full of the higgs field.</v>

966
00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:48.670
<v Speaker 2>And our fundamental particles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the electrons,</v>

967
00:47:48.671 --> 00:47:53.671
<v Speaker 2>let's say in our bodies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interact with that higgs field and in </v>

968
00:47:53.671 --> 00:47:54.750
<v Speaker 2>that process they acquire mass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's the,</v>

969
00:47:54.751 --> 00:47:59.530
<v Speaker 2>it's the mass generation mechanism is </v>
<v Speaker 2>why some particles are massive,</v>

970
00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:03.520
<v Speaker 2>like electrons and quarks and some </v>
<v Speaker 2>things like photons are not massive.</v>

971
00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:06.430
<v Speaker 2>They're massless and then travel through</v>
<v Speaker 2>the universe at the speed of light.</v>

972
00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:11.940
<v Speaker 2>So that's the theory now that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>suggested and built a mathematically </v>

973
00:48:12.101 --> 00:48:14.920
<v Speaker 2>essentially there's early evidence for </v>
<v Speaker 2>it at the time back in the sixties,</v>

974
00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:16.590
<v Speaker 2>but over the years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

975
00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:19.300
<v Speaker 2>the theory called the standard model of </v>
<v Speaker 2>particle physics,</v>

976
00:48:19.301 --> 00:48:21.040
<v Speaker 2>past all experimental tests.</v>

977
00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:22.990
<v Speaker 2>So we got to the point where we thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

978
00:48:22.991 --> 00:48:25.240
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we will build a machine that will either</v>

979
00:48:25.241 --> 00:48:28.690
<v Speaker 2>disprove or prove that theory and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>lhc is such a machine.</v>

980
00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:32.760
<v Speaker 2>If that theory is correct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which now seems to be it,</v>

981
00:48:32.830 --> 00:48:37.830
<v Speaker 2>the prediction is you must find the </v>
<v Speaker 2>higgs particle at the lhc or some kind </v>

982
00:48:38.711 --> 00:48:40.540
<v Speaker 2>of higgs particle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And indeed we found it.</v>

983
00:48:41.050 --> 00:48:42.790
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as we can tell.</v>

984
00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:44.470
<v Speaker 2>So that means that we found a new </v>
<v Speaker 2>particle.</v>

985
00:48:44.471 --> 00:48:49.471
<v Speaker 2>It has the right mass as predicted in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the window that was predicted by the </v>

986
00:48:49.471 --> 00:48:53.071
<v Speaker 2>theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It behaves in every way the theory </v>

987
00:48:53.071 --> 00:48:55.621
<v Speaker 2>Predicts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now what we have to do is be </v>

988
00:48:55.621 --> 00:48:56.890
<v Speaker 2>experimental physicists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the alex turns back on again in about</v>

989
00:48:56.890 --> 00:48:58.310
<v Speaker 2>a month actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's been upgraded,</v>

990
00:48:58.320 --> 00:49:00.400
<v Speaker 2>it's been fixed and it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's maintenance.</v>

991
00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:03.430
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to make more higgs </v>
<v Speaker 2>particles now and that means we can make</v>

992
00:49:03.431 --> 00:49:08.431
<v Speaker 2>more precision measurements and find out</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it is the particle predicted by </v>

993
00:49:08.431 --> 00:49:11.020
<v Speaker 2>peter higgs or maybe it's one of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of particles,</v>

994
00:49:11.021 --> 00:49:14.170
<v Speaker 2>just possibly likely not now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it might be.</v>

995
00:49:14.250 --> 00:49:15.940
<v Speaker 2>So it might be five of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

996
00:49:16.510 --> 00:49:19.330
<v Speaker 2>which would suggest that theories called</v>
<v Speaker 2>supersymmetric theories are right.</v>

997
00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:24.540
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we need to know exactly which </v>

998
00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:25.090
<v Speaker 2>precisely had the thing behaves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why we have more work to do,</v>

999
00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:30.360
<v Speaker 2>but it looks like it's very sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very sure that it is a higgs particle </v>

1000
00:49:30.941 --> 00:49:35.941
<v Speaker 2>that you can just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can mess around and build isa </v>

1001
00:49:35.941 --> 00:49:37.540
<v Speaker 2>terrick theories that get around it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is a new particle there.</v>

1002
00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:39.970
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it looks like one of these things,</v>

1003
00:49:40.180 --> 00:49:45.180
<v Speaker 2>but that's the remarkable thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about it because it was wagner </v>

1004
00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:46.750
<v Speaker 2>when a great physicist wrote an essay </v>
<v Speaker 2>back in the sixties,</v>

1005
00:49:46.751 --> 00:49:51.751
<v Speaker 2>I think called the unreasonable </v>
<v Speaker 2>effectiveness of mathematics and the </v>

1006
00:49:51.751 --> 00:49:54.841
<v Speaker 2>physical sciences and the unreasonable </v>
<v Speaker 2>effectiveness is demonstrated by this </v>

1007
00:49:54.841 --> 00:49:59.061
<v Speaker 2>discovery because it really is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mathematical prediction is we think </v>

1008
00:49:59.061 --> 00:50:00.820
<v Speaker 2>there's a new fundamental particle that </v>
<v Speaker 2>does the job of giving math to the other</v>

1009
00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:05.850
<v Speaker 2>particles and this is how it does it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is how it behaves and this is what </v>

1010
00:50:05.850 --> 00:50:06.430
<v Speaker 2>it will look like and this is what it </v>
<v Speaker 2>will do.</v>

1011
00:50:06.910 --> 00:50:11.910
<v Speaker 2>And then 50 years later you build the </v>
<v Speaker 2>biggest machine ever built 60 miles into</v>

1012
00:50:12.731 --> 00:50:14.650
<v Speaker 2>conference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of it's in France,</v>

1013
00:50:14.651 --> 00:50:16.900
<v Speaker 2>a bit of it's in Switzerland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tense scientists,</v>

1014
00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:18.930
<v Speaker 2>hundred and 50 countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1015
00:50:18.931 --> 00:50:23.931
<v Speaker 2>you accelerate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Protons are the nuclei of hydrogen </v>

1016
00:50:23.931 --> 00:50:23.931
<v Speaker 2>around this thing at 99 point nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine,</v>

1017
00:50:23.931 --> 00:50:23.931
<v Speaker 2>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine,</v>

1018
00:50:23.931 --> 00:50:24.490
<v Speaker 2>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine percent.</v>

1019
00:50:24.491 --> 00:50:29.491
<v Speaker 2>The speed of light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go around the 16 miles thousand </v>

1020
00:50:29.491 --> 00:50:30.010
<v Speaker 2>times a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can collide $600,</v>

1021
00:50:30.011 --> 00:50:35.011
<v Speaker 2>million of them together every second to</v>
<v Speaker 2>recreate the conditions that were </v>

1022
00:50:35.011 --> 00:50:38.201
<v Speaker 2>present less than a billionth of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>second after the universe began </v>

1023
00:50:38.201 --> 00:50:39.200
<v Speaker 2>photographing in the big east digital </v>
<v Speaker 2>cameras ever built.</v>

1024
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:42.620
<v Speaker 2>The one I Work on called atlas is 40,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 meters in diameter,</v>

1025
00:50:43.670 --> 00:50:46.190
<v Speaker 2>vast vast thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>7,000</v>

1026
00:50:46.191 --> 00:50:51.191
<v Speaker 2>tons of digital camera in a cabin beside</v>
<v Speaker 2>st paul's cathedral underneath the </v>

1027
00:50:51.651 --> 00:50:56.651
<v Speaker 2>ground in Switzerland and you find it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find this guy,</v>

1028
00:50:57.710 --> 00:51:02.710
<v Speaker 2>but he's a higgs working with many of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the people predicted to exist 50 years </v>

1029
00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:04.100
<v Speaker 2>ago because he did some sums and so it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a real.</v>

1030
00:51:04.230 --> 00:51:06.410
<v Speaker 2>It's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the universe does behave like that.</v>

1031
00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:10.310
<v Speaker 2>There is a condensate in the vacuum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is a higgs condensate.</v>

1032
00:51:10.590 --> 00:51:15.590
<v Speaker 2>It does give mass to do the particles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a tremendous testament to the </v>

1033
00:51:15.740 --> 00:51:17.720
<v Speaker 2>power of human reasoning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1034
00:51:17.830 --> 00:51:20.840
<v Speaker 2>and it means that we understand physics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It means that we.</v>

1035
00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:22.560
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the important things about</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1036
00:51:22.561 --> 00:51:25.370
<v Speaker 2>It means that our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our understanding of fundamental physics</v>

1037
00:51:25.371 --> 00:51:27.980
<v Speaker 2>is not horribly wrong at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1038
00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:33.010
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's good enough to predict something </v>

1039
00:51:33.010 --> 00:51:35.831
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a remarkable achievement that </v>

1040
00:51:35.831 --> 00:51:35.831
<v Speaker 2>is mind blowing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is truly,</v>

1041
00:51:35.831 --> 00:51:37.910
<v Speaker 2>truly mind blowing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know when peter higgs?</v>

1042
00:51:37.911 --> 00:51:42.911
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the day that the discovery was </v>

1043
00:51:42.911 --> 00:51:45.431
<v Speaker 2>announced at cern,</v>
<v Speaker 2>packed auditorium and peter was there </v>

1044
00:51:45.431 --> 00:51:47.360
<v Speaker 2>and a journalist went up to him </v>
<v Speaker 2>afterwards and just what I've said,</v>

1045
00:51:47.361 --> 00:51:52.361
<v Speaker 2>this is what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This machine did a family thing and </v>

1046
00:51:52.361 --> 00:51:52.361
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do you feel?</v>

1047
00:51:52.361 --> 00:51:52.400
<v Speaker 2>Professor hagen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>

1048
00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:54.590
<v Speaker 2>it's very nice to be right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes</v>

1049
00:51:57.260 --> 00:52:02.050
<v Speaker 3>really understated british and yes he </v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

1050
00:52:02.090 --> 00:52:07.090
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's exactly how a cup of tea american</v>

1051
00:52:08.871 --> 00:52:13.160
<v Speaker 3>would show up with a fur coat on </v>
<v Speaker 3>diamonds around his glasses.</v>

1052
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:15.500
<v Speaker 3>We have a big pimp cane and then someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>had come up,</v>

1053
00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:21.010
<v Speaker 3>have given the nobel prize to beyonce </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that'd be grammys last night,</v>

1054
00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:27.530
<v Speaker 3>wasn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was it was.</v>

1055
00:52:27.531 --> 00:52:29.390
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was in Kenya.</v>

1056
00:52:29.391 --> 00:52:31.250
<v Speaker 3>West wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It keeps jumping on stage.</v>

1057
00:52:31.590 --> 00:52:33.800
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he jumped on stage once,</v>

1058
00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:35.930
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't do it again last night.</v>

1059
00:52:35.931 --> 00:52:36.550
<v Speaker 3>Did he?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently,</v>

1060
00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:40.040
<v Speaker 3>ginny almost have it go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

1061
00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:45.490
<v Speaker 3>I can't be bothered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I just keep thinking part of the </v>

1062
00:52:45.490 --> 00:52:45.690
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just want to talk about kanye west,</v>

1063
00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:49.550
<v Speaker 3>the middle of the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the last discussions I called the</v>

1064
00:52:49.551 --> 00:52:54.500
<v Speaker 3>other guy jay zed called z zed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a british thing.</v>

1065
00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:59.270
<v Speaker 3>People don't know like a zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Six is a type of corvette.</v>

1066
00:52:59.510 --> 00:53:04.510
<v Speaker 3>They call it zedo six.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So jason was copy of the large hadron </v>

1067
00:53:07.161 --> 00:53:11.360
<v Speaker 3>collider also figured out or or proved </v>
<v Speaker 3>proved cork.</v>

1068
00:53:11.490 --> 00:53:13.060
<v Speaker 3>Gluon plasma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1069
00:53:13.070 --> 00:53:14.930
<v Speaker 3>so that is explain that the</v>

1070
00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:19.930
<v Speaker 2>universe in the history of the universe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so so way after the higgs mechanism </v>

1071
00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:20.240
<v Speaker 2>kicks in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get an.</v>

1072
00:53:20.690 --> 00:53:24.890
<v Speaker 2>You have a period when it's still too </v>
<v Speaker 2>hot for protons and neutrons to form the</v>

1073
00:53:24.930 --> 00:53:28.440
<v Speaker 2>building blocks of atomic nuclei or </v>
<v Speaker 2>protons and neutrons day.</v>

1074
00:53:28.580 --> 00:53:33.510
<v Speaker 2>So a proton is made of two up quarks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quarks and a damn clock and a neutron is</v>

1075
00:53:33.511 --> 00:53:36.240
<v Speaker 2>made a $2 and then up and then some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the stuff in there,</v>

1076
00:53:36.241 --> 00:53:40.190
<v Speaker 2>glue gluons and things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what the universe was winter aphasia</v>

1077
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:45.230
<v Speaker 2>and it was too hot for that to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you get this plasmid is see of the </v>

1078
00:53:45.230 --> 00:53:49.461
<v Speaker 2>free quarks and gluons and all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>things just before it gets cold enough </v>

1079
00:53:49.461 --> 00:53:53.571
<v Speaker 2>to condense into protons and neutrons </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we investigate that by colliding a </v>

1080
00:53:53.571 --> 00:53:58.490
<v Speaker 2>heavier things in protons together at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the lhc so we can do silver atoms or a </v>

1081
00:53:58.980 --> 00:54:01.380
<v Speaker 2>silver nuclei or lead nuclei and things </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1082
00:54:01.410 --> 00:54:06.410
<v Speaker 2>The lhc can do that and it produces this</v>
<v Speaker 2>fat a millionth of a second after the </v>

1083
00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:06.660
<v Speaker 2>big bang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So quite a long time.</v>

1084
00:54:07.050 --> 00:54:12.050
<v Speaker 2>Quite a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a lot has happened in that </v>

1085
00:54:12.050 --> 00:54:14.991
<v Speaker 2>relatively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we can do that as well and see how </v>

1086
00:54:14.991 --> 00:54:17.511
<v Speaker 2>that phase of the universe behaved and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff is supposed to be just </v>

1087
00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:19.620
<v Speaker 2>immeasurably heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1088
00:54:20.130 --> 00:54:21.540
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the atomic nuclei.</v>

1089
00:54:21.570 --> 00:54:22.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1090
00:54:22.141 --> 00:54:27.141
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you look at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it astrophysical example would be a </v>

1091
00:54:27.141 --> 00:54:28.650
<v Speaker 2>neutron star,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is basically a big nucleus,</v>

1092
00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:33.680
<v Speaker 2>nuclear dense material.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The end point of a collapse star when </v>

1093
00:54:33.680 --> 00:54:35.220
<v Speaker 2>it's run out of fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's not too big.</v>

1094
00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:36.900
<v Speaker 2>It's too big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll turn into a black hole.</v>

1095
00:54:37.070 --> 00:54:41.700
<v Speaker 2>So neutron star would be a one and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>half times the mass of the sun.</v>

1096
00:54:41.730 --> 00:54:45.510
<v Speaker 2>Let's say something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it will be a radius of 10 miles,</v>

1097
00:54:46.110 --> 00:54:49.620
<v Speaker 2>so it would easily fit in the la </v>
<v Speaker 2>metropolitan area.</v>

1098
00:54:49.650 --> 00:54:52.800
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it would have the mass of the sub or</v>

1099
00:54:52.801 --> 00:54:56.400
<v Speaker 2>greater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's an atomic nucleus density.</v>

1100
00:54:56.580 --> 00:54:59.700
<v Speaker 2>That's how you can imagine it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something as massive as some compressing</v>

1101
00:54:59.701 --> 00:55:03.690
<v Speaker 2>something 10 miles across and we see </v>
<v Speaker 2>these things all over the years.</v>

1102
00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:05.710
<v Speaker 2>Neutron stars are fascinating things.</v>

1103
00:55:08.310 --> 00:55:13.310
<v Speaker 2>Someone online was explaining it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some physicists was explaining that if </v>

1104
00:55:13.310 --> 00:55:17.691
<v Speaker 2>you had this court glue on plasma and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the size of a sugar cube,</v>

1105
00:55:18.210 --> 00:55:22.140
<v Speaker 2>it was some ungodly amount of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1106
00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:24.740
<v Speaker 2>like he couldn't even imagine it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1107
00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:26.100
<v Speaker 2>mount everest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1108
00:55:26.101 --> 00:55:31.101
<v Speaker 2>that kind of who'd be like mount everest</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't quite enormous broke my brain,</v>

1109
00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:39.320
<v Speaker 2>be thinking about all our lady to </v>
<v Speaker 2>earlier all the mess our mass is in the </v>

1110
00:55:39.841 --> 00:55:44.841
<v Speaker 2>nuclei and if you've got all our nuclei </v>
<v Speaker 2>mining your nuclei and stuffed them </v>

1111
00:55:44.841 --> 00:55:47.480
<v Speaker 2>together into that density that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1112
00:55:47.490 --> 00:55:50.490
<v Speaker 2>it would be a grain of sand or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>less.</v>

1113
00:55:51.210 --> 00:55:53.000
<v Speaker 2>So you could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1114
00:55:53.001 --> 00:55:58.001
<v Speaker 2>you think about the unit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the modern theories of the big </v>

1115
00:55:58.001 --> 00:55:59.130
<v Speaker 2>bang it talked about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these inflationary cosmology theories,</v>

1116
00:55:59.350 --> 00:56:01.860
<v Speaker 2>those suggest that the entire observable</v>
<v Speaker 2>universe,</v>

1117
00:56:01.890 --> 00:56:04.530
<v Speaker 2>which has now got $350 billion galaxies </v>
<v Speaker 2>in it,</v>

1118
00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:07.660
<v Speaker 2>was some point the size of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

1119
00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:12.670
<v Speaker 2>a baseball or less so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we imagine that we speak of in,</v>

1120
00:56:13.031 --> 00:56:18.031
<v Speaker 2>in modern physics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have theories to address the time </v>

1121
00:56:18.031 --> 00:56:20.430
<v Speaker 2>when the entire observable universe was </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that you could hold,</v>

1122
00:56:20.431 --> 00:56:22.910
<v Speaker 2>so you've got enough energy in there to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make $350,</v>

1123
00:56:23.290 --> 00:56:28.290
<v Speaker 2>galaxies each with 200 billion stars and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's remarkable that we're not quite </v>

1124
00:56:28.841 --> 00:56:31.130
<v Speaker 2>there with the laws of physics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're not far that.</v>

1125
00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:34.270
<v Speaker 2>Those are the kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the physics we're doing at lhc.</v>

1126
00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:39.630
<v Speaker 2>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're trying to explore the laws of </v>

1127
00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:41.761
<v Speaker 2>nature and seat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>find the laws of nature will describe </v>

1128
00:56:41.761 --> 00:56:43.530
<v Speaker 2>the universe when it was that hot and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that dense and we are quite close.</v>

1129
00:56:43.550 --> 00:56:48.550
<v Speaker 2>I say we were good from about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>billionth of a second after the big </v>

1130
00:56:48.550 --> 00:56:51.751
<v Speaker 2>bang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then that's where we have our theories </v>

1131
00:56:51.751 --> 00:56:51.751
<v Speaker 2>that talk about the higgs boson and </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

1132
00:56:51.751 --> 00:56:52.870
<v Speaker 2>and so we understand that very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1133
00:56:52.871 --> 00:56:53.400
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1134
00:56:53.401 --> 00:56:56.560
<v Speaker 2>the challenge now is to get back beyond </v>
<v Speaker 2>that and that's where you,</v>

1135
00:56:56.820 --> 00:56:58.900
<v Speaker 2>that's where string theory attempts to </v>
<v Speaker 2>live,</v>

1136
00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:00.970
<v Speaker 2>which you mentioned earlier string </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory.</v>

1137
00:57:00.971 --> 00:57:03.480
<v Speaker 2>We don't know if it's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have no evidence to that.</v>

1138
00:57:03.510 --> 00:57:08.170
<v Speaker 2>That is an approach to trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>describe the universe before,</v>

1139
00:57:08.690 --> 00:57:11.500
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those times when our current laws work,</v>

1140
00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:15.500
<v Speaker 4>the idea of a birth and a death of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>universe trouble.</v>

1141
00:57:15.501 --> 00:57:20.501
<v Speaker 4>Some people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the idea that we have sort of </v>

1142
00:57:20.501 --> 00:57:23.591
<v Speaker 4>artificially subscribed the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 4>this had to start somewhere and that it </v>

1143
00:57:23.591 --> 00:57:27.971
<v Speaker 4>may very well be an infinite expansion </v>
<v Speaker 4>and contraction like waves going in </v>

1144
00:57:27.971 --> 00:57:32.950
<v Speaker 4>waves going out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea being that the entire universe </v>

1145
00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:36.341
<v Speaker 4>may one day get to a point where it </v>
<v Speaker 4>pulls down into itself and becomes one </v>

1146
00:57:37.131 --> 00:57:42.131
<v Speaker 4>event.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Horizon one infinite peace of mass and </v>

1147
00:57:42.131 --> 00:57:43.880
<v Speaker 4>then starts all over again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that possible?</v>

1148
00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:45.890
<v Speaker 4>The current,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you look at the,</v>

1149
00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:51.190
<v Speaker 2>how the universe is expanding at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment than it is accelerating in its </v>

1150
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:55.721
<v Speaker 2>expansion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the measurements tell us that the </v>

1151
00:57:55.721 --> 00:57:57.530
<v Speaker 2>expansion rate itself is getting faster </v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

1152
00:57:57.560 --> 00:57:59.010
<v Speaker 2>we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1153
00:57:59.430 --> 00:58:01.880
<v Speaker 2>a name for that and we call it dark </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy.</v>

1154
00:58:02.150 --> 00:58:07.150
<v Speaker 2>And so the of older 65,</v>
<v Speaker 2>70 percent of the energy in the universe</v>

1155
00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:12.940
<v Speaker 2>appears to be taken up in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in driving this increasingly fast </v>

1156
00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:17.351
<v Speaker 2>expansion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so that looks like if nothing </v>

1157
00:58:17.351 --> 00:58:17.351
<v Speaker 2>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then that becomes dominant.</v>

1158
00:58:17.351 --> 00:58:17.650
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1159
00:58:17.690 --> 00:58:20.170
<v Speaker 2>so it continues to accelerate and </v>
<v Speaker 2>expansion.</v>

1160
00:58:20.300 --> 00:58:24.280
<v Speaker 2>And in the end you get something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>looks like this inflationary period that</v>

1161
00:58:24.290 --> 00:58:27.170
<v Speaker 2>I said may,</v>
<v Speaker 2>may have existed before the universe was</v>

1162
00:58:27.171 --> 00:58:28.910
<v Speaker 2>hot and dense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it looks like.</v>

1163
00:58:29.130 --> 00:58:31.070
<v Speaker 2>So that looks like what's happening at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the moment.</v>

1164
00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:36.400
<v Speaker 2>So whether that can stop where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether there's something that can stop </v>

1165
00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:38.210
<v Speaker 2>it in the same way as it seems to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped very early in the history by the</v>

1166
00:58:38.211 --> 00:58:39.830
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And whether that's true,</v>

1167
00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:41.930
<v Speaker 2>nobody knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know the mechanism,</v>

1168
00:58:42.290 --> 00:58:45.170
<v Speaker 2>but the measurements tellers have </v>
<v Speaker 2>distant.</v>

1169
00:58:45.171 --> 00:58:48.170
<v Speaker 2>Particularly looking at supernova in </v>
<v Speaker 2>distant galaxies.</v>

1170
00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:51.230
<v Speaker 2>And also actually from this cosmic </v>
<v Speaker 2>microwave background radiation.</v>

1171
00:58:51.231 --> 00:58:56.231
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned earlier that the detailed </v>
<v Speaker 2>modeling and measurements of that old </v>

1172
00:58:56.231 --> 00:58:58.400
<v Speaker 2>consistent and that the university is </v>
<v Speaker 2>accelerating in its expansion,</v>

1173
00:58:58.670 --> 00:59:03.670
<v Speaker 2>so that would suggest that it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to rebound because it's </v>

1174
00:59:03.670 --> 00:59:07.030
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a big rip scenario almost </v>

1175
00:59:07.030 --> 00:59:10.211
<v Speaker 2>where everything's accelerated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That space time is stretching it a </v>

1176
00:59:10.211 --> 00:59:12.470
<v Speaker 2>faster and faster rate at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems to be what's happening,</v>

1177
00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:17.900
<v Speaker 4>so you feel that it's much more likely </v>
<v Speaker 4>that there are infinite numbers of these</v>

1178
00:59:20.161 --> 00:59:25.161
<v Speaker 4>things happening,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that there's not just one big bang that </v>

1179
00:59:25.161 --> 00:59:26.750
<v Speaker 4>creates this universe and we're watching</v>
<v Speaker 4>this universe expand,</v>

1180
00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:31.930
<v Speaker 4>but that there's infinite numbers of </v>
<v Speaker 4>these things that are happening at the </v>

1181
00:59:31.930 --> 00:59:32.870
<v Speaker 4>exact same time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That said,</v>

1182
00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:35.160
<v Speaker 2>that's most speculative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1183
00:59:35.161 --> 00:59:39.810
<v Speaker 2>so the waY that the inflation is </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably textbook.</v>

1184
00:59:39.870 --> 00:59:42.780
<v Speaker 2>Now you got some physicists that will </v>
<v Speaker 2>argue with it,</v>

1185
00:59:42.781 --> 00:59:47.781
<v Speaker 2>but broadly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think many astrophysicists think the </v>

1186
00:59:47.781 --> 00:59:51.621
<v Speaker 2>inflation is the best theory we have </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it makes predictions that agree </v>

1187
00:59:51.621 --> 00:59:51.621
<v Speaker 2>with observation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's.</v>

1188
00:59:51.621 --> 00:59:56.541
<v Speaker 2>It's the best theory in terms of making </v>
<v Speaker 2>the best predictions at the moment in </v>

1189
00:59:56.541 --> 00:59:58.350
<v Speaker 2>this is that exact suggested expansion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very fast,</v>

1190
00:59:58.351 --> 01:00:00.450
<v Speaker 2>super luminal faster than light </v>
<v Speaker 2>expansion.</v>

1191
01:00:00.690 --> 01:00:05.690
<v Speaker 2>That stops and the end point of that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>what we used to call the Big bang and </v>

1192
01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:07.740
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's broadly speaking,</v>

1193
01:00:08.290 --> 01:00:13.290
<v Speaker 2>textbook stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what you teach and undergraduate </v>

1194
01:00:13.290 --> 01:00:15.741
<v Speaker 2>Cosmology causes that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then some physicists argue that the </v>

1195
01:00:16.021 --> 01:00:19.950
<v Speaker 2>natural extension to those theories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the theories called eternal inflation,</v>

1196
01:00:20.010 --> 01:00:22.030
<v Speaker 2>which are what you said where you said </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1197
01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:24.390
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this exponential expansion of space time</v>

1198
01:00:24.391 --> 01:00:29.391
<v Speaker 2>is always going on and it stopped just </v>
<v Speaker 2>in little patches and that little patch </v>

1199
01:00:29.391 --> 01:00:33.210
<v Speaker 2>is where you generate a new pocKet </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe if you like,</v>

1200
01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:38.300
<v Speaker 2>of which ours is one example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can have an infinite number of </v>

1201
01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:41.451
<v Speaker 2>those and they were being that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be being produced now and you can </v>

1202
01:00:41.451 --> 01:00:42.570
<v Speaker 2>asK the question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how long has that been going on?</v>

1203
01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:48.020
<v Speaker 2>And the answer is nobody knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a debate even amongst the </v>

1204
01:00:48.020 --> 01:00:51.681
<v Speaker 2>people who believe in those theories </v>
<v Speaker 2>about whether it could have gone on </v>

1205
01:00:51.681 --> 01:00:53.220
<v Speaker 2>forever or whether it would have started</v>
<v Speaker 2>in what a colleague of mine at durham,</v>

1206
01:00:53.221 --> 01:00:55.530
<v Speaker 2>carlos frank calls the mother of all big</v>
<v Speaker 2>bangs.</v>

1207
01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:59.280
<v Speaker 2>So was the mother of all bIg bangs that </v>
<v Speaker 2>set this process in motion.</v>

1208
01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:02.340
<v Speaker 2>And in that thing that got said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that big fractal thing,</v>

1209
01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:07.360
<v Speaker 2>you get loads of little bit guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the answer is this is cutting edge </v>

1210
01:01:07.360 --> 01:01:07.680
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very exciting.</v>

1211
01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:08.700
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so,</v>

1212
01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:12.480
<v Speaker 2>so I'd say just to be very precise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the inflationary bit,</v>

1213
01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:17.700
<v Speaker 2>the simple bits which was first put </v>
<v Speaker 2>forward in the eighties actually by alan</v>

1214
01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:20.610
<v Speaker 2>guth and people like that in the us and </v>
<v Speaker 2>andre,</v>

1215
01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:25.620
<v Speaker 2>linda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another one that looks right in the </v>

1216
01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:28.131
<v Speaker 2>sense that it matches data very well and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the consequences of it are argued about </v>

1217
01:01:28.131 --> 01:01:29.880
<v Speaker 2>an interactive areas of research at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>

1218
01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:31.620
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that</v>

1219
01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:36.840
<v Speaker 4>people were terrified of about the large</v>
<v Speaker 4>hadron collider is that in trying to </v>

1220
01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:40.130
<v Speaker 4>find the higgs that you might </v>
<v Speaker 4>accidentally create black holes,</v>

1221
01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:45.380
<v Speaker 4>little tiny one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it would just go eat and through the </v>

1222
01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:45.380
<v Speaker 4>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a,</v>

1223
01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:48.331
<v Speaker 4>like a little ping pong ball that's shot</v>
<v Speaker 4>through the entire planet that that's </v>

1224
01:01:48.331 --> 01:01:51.040
<v Speaker 4>idiots like me that thought that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>holy shit,</v>

1225
01:01:54.190 --> 01:01:57.280
<v Speaker 4>is it possible to create a big bang or </v>
<v Speaker 4>excuse me,</v>

1226
01:01:57.281 --> 01:01:58.210
<v Speaker 4>a black hole?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that,</v>

1227
01:01:58.211 --> 01:02:00.790
<v Speaker 4>is it possible theoretically to have </v>
<v Speaker 4>enough power?</v>

1228
01:02:00.940 --> 01:02:03.610
<v Speaker 4>Like if you don't have it right now with</v>
<v Speaker 4>the large hadron collider,</v>

1229
01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:08.760
<v Speaker 4>is it possible that a larger machine </v>
<v Speaker 4>will be created and human beings can </v>

1230
01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:09.580
<v Speaker 4>recreate a black hole?</v>

1231
01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:11.600
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's possible.</v>

1232
01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:16.660
<v Speaker 2>And it's possible if You have extra </v>
<v Speaker 2>dimensions in the universe.</v>

1233
01:02:17.570 --> 01:02:19.410
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the thing is that,</v>

1234
01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:24.470
<v Speaker 2>so we need gravity's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A very weak force is by far the weakest </v>

1235
01:02:24.470 --> 01:02:27.861
<v Speaker 2>of the four fundamental forces of nature</v>
<v Speaker 2>be billions and billions of times a </v>

1236
01:02:27.861 --> 01:02:27.861
<v Speaker 2>week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other ones,</v>

1237
01:02:27.861 --> 01:02:29.730
<v Speaker 2>which you can tell because you can pick </v>
<v Speaker 2>up your phone,</v>

1238
01:02:29.790 --> 01:02:34.790
<v Speaker 2>even though the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>planet earth is trying to stop me doing </v>

1239
01:02:34.790 --> 01:02:37.671
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I can just resist the pull of </v>

1240
01:02:37.671 --> 01:02:37.671
<v Speaker 2>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So gravity is very weak.</v>

1241
01:02:37.671 --> 01:02:38.490
<v Speaker 2>So that gives you a clue that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

1242
01:02:38.491 --> 01:02:40.980
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what energy?</v>

1243
01:02:41.010 --> 01:02:43.230
<v Speaker 2>How far do I have to go back in time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you like,</v>

1244
01:02:43.410 --> 01:02:46.580
<v Speaker 2>towards the big bang before it's so hot </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>

1245
01:02:46.620 --> 01:02:48.870
<v Speaker 2>that gravity is as strong as the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>forces.</v>

1246
01:02:48.930 --> 01:02:50.910
<v Speaker 2>The strength of the force is varies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should say,</v>

1247
01:02:50.911 --> 01:02:51.300
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

1248
01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:53.930
<v Speaker 2>with energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they changed so that.</v>

1249
01:02:54.210 --> 01:02:57.660
<v Speaker 2>And we've seen this behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so so two of the forces,</v>

1250
01:02:57.690 --> 01:03:02.690
<v Speaker 2>so-called electromagnetism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the most familiar on </v>

1251
01:03:02.690 --> 01:03:03.390
<v Speaker 2>electricity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that one a and the weak nuclear force,</v>

1252
01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.880
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the forces that operates</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the atomic nucleus.</v>

1253
01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:11.150
<v Speaker 2>They are the same force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're manifestations of the same </v>

1254
01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:11.150
<v Speaker 2>force,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we've seen this experimentally,</v>

1255
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:13.890
<v Speaker 2>and in fact the higgs boson is part of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that process.</v>

1256
01:03:14.250 --> 01:03:17.610
<v Speaker 2>And so we've seen the energies that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>become the same force.</v>

1257
01:03:17.790 --> 01:03:20.120
<v Speaker 2>So the idea is the other force,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the strong nuclear force,</v>

1258
01:03:20.210 --> 01:03:25.210
<v Speaker 2>if you go to higher energies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>temperatures convergys and they'd have </v>

1259
01:03:25.210 --> 01:03:25.350
<v Speaker 2>some things called grand unified </v>
<v Speaker 2>theories,</v>

1260
01:03:25.710 --> 01:03:28.570
<v Speaker 2>and then gravity makes it a lethargic </v>
<v Speaker 2>way back and,</v>

1261
01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:31.440
<v Speaker 2>and unifies with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something called the planck energy,</v>

1262
01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:35.220
<v Speaker 2>which is immense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The short timescales after the origin of</v>

1263
01:03:35.221 --> 01:03:37.050
<v Speaker 2>the universe have you on so very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very hot,</v>

1264
01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:39.150
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so way in excess of anything.</v>

1265
01:03:39.570 --> 01:03:43.200
<v Speaker 2>So if you just want to just create black</v>
<v Speaker 2>holes in a lab,</v>

1266
01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:46.440
<v Speaker 2>then the nike thing is you'd have to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>to those energies and there's nowhere in</v>

1267
01:03:46.441 --> 01:03:47.560
<v Speaker 2>the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd never do it.</v>

1268
01:03:47.561 --> 01:03:50.100
<v Speaker 2>So you'd have a part accelerated the </v>
<v Speaker 2>side of the observable universe and they</v>

1269
01:03:50.101 --> 01:03:55.101
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be big enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you allow extra dimensions in </v>

1270
01:03:55.101 --> 01:03:59.991
<v Speaker 2>space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you might imagine that we will live </v>

1271
01:03:59.991 --> 01:04:02.601
<v Speaker 2>in a three dimensional space and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's time as well as four dimensions </v>

1272
01:04:02.601 --> 01:04:06.170
<v Speaker 2>if you allow it to be five or six or 30.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing to string theory that they keep </v>

1273
01:04:06.811 --> 01:04:09.480
<v Speaker 2>changing their mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's 13 now,</v>

1274
01:04:09.870 --> 01:04:14.870
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then what you can do is you can </v>

1275
01:04:15.901 --> 01:04:19.890
<v Speaker 2>arrange for that energy scale at which </v>
<v Speaker 2>gravity becomes important to to,</v>

1276
01:04:19.930 --> 01:04:24.930
<v Speaker 2>to to come up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the temperatures to drop so you can </v>

1277
01:04:24.930 --> 01:04:26.460
<v Speaker 2>arraign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can arrange in some contrived way to</v>

1278
01:04:26.461 --> 01:04:30.120
<v Speaker 2>get to the point where you could </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly access gravity,</v>

1279
01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:33.120
<v Speaker 2>see gravity in action as it were in </v>
<v Speaker 2>particle accelerators,</v>

1280
01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:38.500
<v Speaker 2>at things as big as the lhc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in that case you would produce we </v>

1281
01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:44.300
<v Speaker 2>little black holes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would then evaporate away very </v>

1282
01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:44.300
<v Speaker 2>quickly.</v>

1283
01:04:44.300 --> 01:04:45.420
<v Speaker 2>We think through a process called </v>
<v Speaker 2>hawking radiation and they be.</v>

1284
01:04:45.421 --> 01:04:50.421
<v Speaker 2>They began.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can conceive of a way that you </v>

1285
01:04:50.421 --> 01:04:51.900
<v Speaker 2>could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if given a big of a leap,</v>

1286
01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:56.930
<v Speaker 2>that there are extra dimensions in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe and given that they're </v>

1287
01:04:56.930 --> 01:04:59.391
<v Speaker 2>configured in the right way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you can imagine that you could do </v>

1288
01:04:59.391 --> 01:04:59.391
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The the.</v>

1289
01:04:59.391 --> 01:05:02.370
<v Speaker 2>The interesting point though is that so </v>
<v Speaker 2>lhc is,</v>

1290
01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:04.710
<v Speaker 2>is it's a tremendous technological </v>
<v Speaker 2>achievement,</v>

1291
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:10.190
<v Speaker 2>but it collides particles together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>energies that are just insignificant </v>

1292
01:05:10.190 --> 01:05:12.600
<v Speaker 2>compared to the energies that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>available in the universe to nature.</v>

1293
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:14.880
<v Speaker 2>So cosmic rays,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1294
01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.870
<v Speaker 2>hit the earth with energies far in </v>
<v Speaker 2>excess of those that we generated,</v>

1295
01:05:18.890 --> 01:05:23.890
<v Speaker 2>lhc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So whatever physics she can conceivably </v>

1296
01:05:23.890 --> 01:05:27.511
<v Speaker 2>access of these parcels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>accelerators is already been access now </v>

1297
01:05:27.511 --> 01:05:31.620
<v Speaker 2>in the upper atmosphere of the planet </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the cosmic ray collisions are </v>

1298
01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:35.101
<v Speaker 2>immensely higher energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So so you can make little black holes </v>

1299
01:05:35.101 --> 01:05:36.730
<v Speaker 2>because they're extra dimensions in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>

1300
01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:40.210
<v Speaker 2>Then they are raining down on us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they're here.</v>

1301
01:05:40.480 --> 01:05:43.570
<v Speaker 2>They get made because the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the energies of the lhc is,</v>

1302
01:05:43.571 --> 01:05:48.571
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>astrophysical processes all over the </v>

1303
01:05:48.571 --> 01:05:49.210
<v Speaker 2>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>way in excess way exceed those energies.</v>

1304
01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:52.690
<v Speaker 2>We were not very good at doing high </v>
<v Speaker 2>energy collisions compared to nature.</v>

1305
01:05:53.070 --> 01:05:58.070
<v Speaker 2>That's a supernova,</v>
<v Speaker 2>explosions and compared to all the and </v>

1306
01:05:58.070 --> 01:05:59.110
<v Speaker 2>cosmic rays because it cosmic ray </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually that was detected,</v>

1307
01:05:59.111 --> 01:06:04.111
<v Speaker 2>I think the highest energy one was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>had the energy of a professional tennis </v>

1308
01:06:04.111 --> 01:06:06.700
<v Speaker 2>player serve so hundred mile an hour </v>
<v Speaker 2>tennis ball.</v>

1309
01:06:07.180 --> 01:06:08.860
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a single particle.</v>

1310
01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:12.280
<v Speaker 2>So imagine getting hit by a hundred mile</v>
<v Speaker 2>an hour.</v>

1311
01:06:12.430 --> 01:06:14.650
<v Speaker 2>Professional tennis players serve on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>back of their head,</v>

1312
01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:20.060
<v Speaker 2>their cosmic rays with that energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the one particle of would be equal </v>

1313
01:06:20.651 --> 01:06:25.270
<v Speaker 2>to 100 miles an hour tennis ball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these are credible energies.</v>

1314
01:06:25.390 --> 01:06:28.420
<v Speaker 2>Way beyond any how many particles would </v>
<v Speaker 2>be in a tennis ball.</v>

1315
01:06:29.230 --> 01:06:30.010
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a good question.</v>

1316
01:06:30.011 --> 01:06:32.080
<v Speaker 2>That.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's do some sort of thing.</v>

1317
01:06:32.130 --> 01:06:33.070
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I have a gander.</v>

1318
01:06:33.071 --> 01:06:36.850
<v Speaker 2>Rose number is what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Six times 10 to the 23,</v>

1319
01:06:36.851 --> 01:06:37.810
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

1320
01:06:37.870 --> 01:06:42.870
<v Speaker 2>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the number of particles in the </v>

1321
01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:44.350
<v Speaker 2>number of atoms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say in 12 grams of carbon.</v>

1322
01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:49.570
<v Speaker 2>So it solved the old of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So tends to the 23.</v>

1323
01:06:49.571 --> 01:06:53.980
<v Speaker 2>Is it 10 to 24 is a million million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>million million,</v>

1324
01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:55.470
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that.</v>

1325
01:06:55.480 --> 01:06:56.920
<v Speaker 2>So a million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>million,</v>

1326
01:06:56.920 --> 01:07:01.920
<v Speaker 2>million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>million particles would be what you'd </v>

1327
01:07:01.920 --> 01:07:03.511
<v Speaker 2>have in atoms or carbon you'd have in a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You find me on the spot here on you if </v>

1328
01:07:03.511 --> 01:07:06.190
<v Speaker 2>that's what you'd have in about what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sixty,</v>

1329
01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:08.500
<v Speaker 2>60 grams of carbon or something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1330
01:07:08.510 --> 01:07:10.660
<v Speaker 2>So you've asked to guess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd say something like that.</v>

1331
01:07:12.730 --> 01:07:17.020
<v Speaker 2>And that's chemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See I don't do chemistry,</v>

1332
01:07:17.170 --> 01:07:22.170
<v Speaker 2>but that's out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just floating around and we got rid of </v>

1333
01:07:22.170 --> 01:07:22.170
<v Speaker 2>the galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when a hyper nova,</v>

1334
01:07:22.170 --> 01:07:24.030
<v Speaker 2>you still trying to do the math made?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

1335
01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:26.840
<v Speaker 2>Because we live on the web.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to get it right.</v>

1336
01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:28.690
<v Speaker 2>I get older.</v>
<v Speaker 2>people do that all the time.</v>

1337
01:07:28.691 --> 01:07:33.691
<v Speaker 2>The show's all about wrong answers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're just talking.</v>

1338
01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:37.000
<v Speaker 2>It's not your field of study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand,</v>

1339
01:07:37.030 --> 01:07:38.530
<v Speaker 2>but it should be really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good.</v>

1340
01:07:38.531 --> 01:07:43.010
<v Speaker 2>Chemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think chemistry or physics,</v>

1341
01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:46.220
<v Speaker 2>but bigger blogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've watched a documentary once on hyper</v>

1342
01:07:46.221 --> 01:07:51.221
<v Speaker 2>novas that when they were first </v>
<v Speaker 2>discovering the gamma burst in the </v>

1343
01:07:51.221 --> 01:07:54.031
<v Speaker 2>galaxy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they thought it was aliens having wars </v>

1344
01:07:54.031 --> 01:07:54.031
<v Speaker 2>with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the.</v>

1345
01:07:54.031 --> 01:07:55.630
<v Speaker 2>One of the ideas that were being bandied</v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

1346
01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:56.410
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1347
01:07:56.411 --> 01:08:01.180
<v Speaker 2>people do legitimately look for </v>
<v Speaker 2>signatures from alien civilizations like</v>

1348
01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:02.170
<v Speaker 2>that sort of.</v>

1349
01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:04.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's kinda mad people who do it,</v>

1350
01:08:04.930 --> 01:08:06.490
<v Speaker 2>but they're actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can do.</v>

1351
01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:11.520
<v Speaker 2>There are papers written about because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you might say what would the signature </v>

1352
01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:13.060
<v Speaker 2>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of an interstellar star looked like?</v>

1353
01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:16.400
<v Speaker 2>Presumably be a matter and antimatter </v>
<v Speaker 2>drive or something like that.</v>

1354
01:08:16.610 --> 01:08:21.610
<v Speaker 2>So you get these very Clear signatures </v>
<v Speaker 2>of matter and antimatter annihilation </v>

1355
01:08:21.610 --> 01:08:23.540
<v Speaker 2>that we know about because we do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that particular photons,</v>

1356
01:08:23.541 --> 01:08:26.570
<v Speaker 2>gamma rays with particular energies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can,</v>

1357
01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:28.460
<v Speaker 2>you can actually say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well shall we have a look?</v>

1358
01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:32.930
<v Speaker 2>What would it look like if we saw an </v>
<v Speaker 2>interstellar civilization and interspace</v>

1359
01:08:32.950 --> 01:08:35.150
<v Speaker 2>fair in civilization?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could we detect the signatures?</v>

1360
01:08:35.360 --> 01:08:38.420
<v Speaker 2>So there's a bit of work done on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we don't see any.</v>

1361
01:08:38.450 --> 01:08:40.030
<v Speaker 2>We don't see any evidence for anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1362
01:08:40.050 --> 01:08:45.050
<v Speaker 2>when you see someone like the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that run seti search for </v>

1363
01:08:45.050 --> 01:08:48.011
<v Speaker 2>extraterrestrial intelligence and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're always like asking for funding </v>

1364
01:08:48.011 --> 01:08:48.011
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1365
01:08:48.011 --> 01:08:48.011
<v Speaker 2>we need more funding.</v>

1366
01:08:48.011 --> 01:08:49.070
<v Speaker 2>We have to figure this out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one day,</v>

1367
01:08:49.071 --> 01:08:51.970
<v Speaker 2>what if we shut down?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then the signal comes like,</v>

1368
01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:53.990
<v Speaker 2>that seems to me to be like one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>biggest,</v>

1369
01:08:53.991 --> 01:08:58.991
<v Speaker 2>like hail mary wishes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like hoping that you're going to find a </v>

1370
01:08:58.991 --> 01:09:01.880
<v Speaker 2>radio signal from a galaxy far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>far away that has intelligent life.</v>

1371
01:09:01.881 --> 01:09:02.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean our galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1372
01:09:02.961 --> 01:09:04.850
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting though that if you ask </v>
<v Speaker 2>astronomers,</v>

1373
01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:08.060
<v Speaker 2>so you say what's the probability of </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization has been out there.</v>

1374
01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:09.650
<v Speaker 2>Then they will point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1375
01:09:09.651 --> 01:09:14.651
<v Speaker 2>to the new data from the capitalist </v>
<v Speaker 2>space telescope which tells us that </v>

1376
01:09:14.651 --> 01:09:18.371
<v Speaker 2>there are probably around 20 billion </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth like planets in the milky way </v>

1377
01:09:18.371 --> 01:09:23.291
<v Speaker 2>galaxy in the sense that they're small </v>
<v Speaker 2>rocky planets in what's called the </v>

1378
01:09:23.291 --> 01:09:25.370
<v Speaker 2>habitable zone around stars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The goldIlocks main sequence.</v>

1379
01:09:25.371 --> 01:09:27.410
<v Speaker 2>Stars like the earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the sun.</v>

1380
01:09:27.540 --> 01:09:28.670
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so 20 billion.</v>

1381
01:09:28.671 --> 01:09:33.671
<v Speaker 2>So maybe one in 10 stars in the sky has </v>
<v Speaker 2>an earth like planets around it </v>

1382
01:09:34.401 --> 01:09:35.090
<v Speaker 2>potentially.</v>

1383
01:09:35.690 --> 01:09:37.950
<v Speaker 2>So that's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you think 20 billion devices,</v>

1384
01:09:37.990 --> 01:09:40.760
<v Speaker 2>surely life must have a on on some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>

1385
01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:43.040
<v Speaker 2>The answer is probably yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suspect.</v>

1386
01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:44.230
<v Speaker 2>I suspect we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>

1387
01:09:44.231 --> 01:09:46.310
<v Speaker 2>we may find life on mars in the next 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

1388
01:09:46.311 --> 01:09:48.860
<v Speaker 2>but it will be microbes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the question then becomes,</v>

1389
01:09:48.861 --> 01:09:53.861
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how likely is it for simple life if it </v>

1390
01:09:53.861 --> 01:09:54.860
<v Speaker 2>arises to make its way into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization?</v>

1391
01:09:55.520 --> 01:10:00.520
<v Speaker 2>And that's where the biologists come in </v>
<v Speaker 2>and kind of calm the astronomers down </v>

1392
01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:00.520
<v Speaker 2>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1393
01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:03.260
<v Speaker 2>you might think there are lots of places</v>
<v Speaker 2>for life we would agree,</v>

1394
01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:08.740
<v Speaker 2>but on earth it took three point 8 </v>
<v Speaker 2>billion years to go from the origin of </v>

1395
01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:13.010
<v Speaker 2>life to a civilization which is about a </v>
<v Speaker 2>third of the age of the universe,</v>

1396
01:10:13.011 --> 01:10:15.740
<v Speaker 2>give or take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you had to have an unbroken,</v>

1397
01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:18.420
<v Speaker 2>stable line of life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1398
01:10:18.550 --> 01:10:18.980
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1399
01:10:18.981 --> 01:10:19.700
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1400
01:10:19.701 --> 01:10:21.620
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that evolves in the,</v>

1401
01:10:21.621 --> 01:10:23.360
<v Speaker 2>in the right way as it were to.</v>

1402
01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:25.340
<v Speaker 2>So first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets complex.</v>

1403
01:10:25.341 --> 01:10:25.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it took.</v>

1404
01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:31.340
<v Speaker 2>There's a thing called the cambrian </v>
<v Speaker 2>explosion in the history of life on </v>

1405
01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:32.480
<v Speaker 2>earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was about 550 million years ago or</v>

1406
01:10:32.481 --> 01:10:34.310
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we sounds like a long time.</v>

1407
01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:39.880
<v Speaker 2>But for 3 billion years before that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was nothing that we would Call </v>

1408
01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:43.220
<v Speaker 2>complex single celled organisms doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>some clever Stuff like photosynthesis,</v>

1409
01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:48.400
<v Speaker 2>but not much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then suddenly you get a big jump in </v>

1410
01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:49.370
<v Speaker 2>the oxygen content.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of the atmosphere on earth,</v>

1411
01:10:49.670 --> 01:10:53.930
<v Speaker 2>which was to do with photosynthesis and </v>
<v Speaker 2>some geology in play with it.</v>

1412
01:10:54.230 --> 01:10:59.230
<v Speaker 2>That's how the oxygen gets into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>atmosphere and then you get a big jump </v>

1413
01:10:59.230 --> 01:11:01.280
<v Speaker 2>and you get complex life emerging and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then pretty quickly,</v>

1414
01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:03.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>half a billion years or so,</v>

1415
01:11:03.410 --> 01:11:06.470
<v Speaker 2>you go from complex things to to </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization.</v>

1416
01:11:06.710 --> 01:11:09.190
<v Speaker 2>But even then you think about homo </v>
<v Speaker 2>sapien.</v>

1417
01:11:09.191 --> 01:11:11.540
<v Speaker 2>As we mentioneD earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they only arose 200,000</v>

1418
01:11:11.541 --> 01:11:12.020
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>

1419
01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:17.620
<v Speaker 2>So for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the vast majority of the history of </v>

1420
01:11:17.620 --> 01:11:20.331
<v Speaker 2>life on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that has been nothing that could do </v>

1421
01:11:20.331 --> 01:11:20.820
<v Speaker 2>anything clever in the sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking,</v>

1422
01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:23.100
<v Speaker 2>building spacecraft and radio </v>
<v Speaker 2>telescopes.</v>

1423
01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:28.420
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so does it really legitimate debate </v>

1424
01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:30.800
<v Speaker 2>about whether the undoubted increase in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know now that there are homes for </v>

1425
01:11:31.351 --> 01:11:33.540
<v Speaker 2>life out there in the milky way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're very common.</v>

1426
01:11:33.650 --> 01:11:38.650
<v Speaker 2>We know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't know is the probability </v>

1427
01:11:38.650 --> 01:11:39.690
<v Speaker 2>that life will emerge in the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

1428
01:11:39.930 --> 01:11:42.000
<v Speaker 2>And secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the probabIlity that will be turned into</v>

1429
01:11:42.001 --> 01:11:44.190
<v Speaker 2>a civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's very low.</v>

1430
01:11:44.430 --> 01:11:46.710
<v Speaker 2>So I think like I think the ability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I guessed,</v>

1431
01:11:46.711 --> 01:11:51.711
<v Speaker 2>I would say the probability that life </v>
<v Speaker 2>will emerge given the right conditions </v>

1432
01:11:51.711 --> 01:11:54.831
<v Speaker 2>is very high and what one piece of </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence you could put forward to that </v>

1433
01:11:54.831 --> 01:11:59.181
<v Speaker 2>is that it did appear to emerge on earth</v>
<v Speaker 2>as soon as he could after the formation </v>

1434
01:11:59.181 --> 01:11:59.220
<v Speaker 2>of the earth and the oceans.</v>

1435
01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:02.940
<v Speaker 2>So you get life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then it took a long time on earth.</v>

1436
01:12:03.030 --> 01:12:04.060
<v Speaker 2>So you mIght say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the,</v>

1437
01:12:04.540 --> 01:12:09.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the provost of it doing anything </v>

1438
01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:09.540
<v Speaker 2>intelligent and interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite low,</v>

1439
01:12:09.540 --> 01:12:11.130
<v Speaker 2>maybe less than one in 20 billion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in which case you.</v>

1440
01:12:11.450 --> 01:12:14.850
<v Speaker 2>We ended up being the only civilization </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the milky way at the moment.</v>

1441
01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:19.960
<v Speaker 2>It is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can make the argument and my </v>

1442
01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:23.541
<v Speaker 2>experience is academic biologists tend </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be on the cautious side and an </v>

1443
01:12:23.541 --> 01:12:24.780
<v Speaker 2>astronomist tend to be on the optimistic</v>
<v Speaker 2>side.</v>

1444
01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:27.030
<v Speaker 2>It's all relative though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

1445
01:12:27.031 --> 01:12:32.031
<v Speaker 2>Because even if we are only one out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this entire milky way galaxy,</v>

1446
01:12:32.790 --> 01:12:37.790
<v Speaker 2>you still believe that it's possible for</v>
<v Speaker 2>an infinite number of monkeys to create </v>

1447
01:12:37.790 --> 01:12:39.610
<v Speaker 2>the works of shakespeare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So really look at the entire.</v>

1448
01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:42.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they have to.</v>

1449
01:12:42.510 --> 01:12:47.510
<v Speaker 2>We did that with remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you look at the entire universe </v>

1450
01:12:47.611 --> 01:12:52.611
<v Speaker 2>than the idea of there being not just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>life form like human beings,</v>

1451
01:12:53.611 --> 01:12:58.611
<v Speaker 2>but the exact same life form is not just</v>
<v Speaker 2>once but an infinite number of times in </v>

1452
01:12:58.921 --> 01:12:59.400
<v Speaker 2>the universe.</v>

1453
01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:00.630
<v Speaker 2>That's the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

1454
01:13:00.631 --> 01:13:03.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are 350 billion galaxies in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the observable universe,</v>

1455
01:13:03.661 --> 01:13:08.661
<v Speaker 2>so it would be surely there are </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilizations out there and more </v>

1456
01:13:08.661 --> 01:13:08.661
<v Speaker 2>advanced as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1457
01:13:08.661 --> 01:13:13.221
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that's the shore and it has to </v>

1458
01:13:13.221 --> 01:13:13.221
<v Speaker 2>be the case in an infinite universe as </v>
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>

1459
01:13:13.230 --> 01:13:15.480
<v Speaker 2>but it confined ourselves to the milky </v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

1460
01:13:15.840 --> 01:13:20.840
<v Speaker 2>which is really the only place we have </v>
<v Speaker 2>any hope of exploring or contacting </v>

1461
01:13:20.851 --> 01:13:23.760
<v Speaker 2>anyone will never contacted anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even in the andromeda galaxy.</v>

1462
01:13:24.030 --> 01:13:26.490
<v Speaker 2>Two point 2 million light years away,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we won't.</v>

1463
01:13:26.850 --> 01:13:27.790
<v Speaker 2>We won't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

1464
01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:30.150
<v Speaker 2>But the milky way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's someone there,</v>

1465
01:13:30.510 --> 01:13:33.060
<v Speaker 2>we could at least aspire to contact </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

1466
01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:37.470
<v Speaker 2>so it's worth the effort to listen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't spend much money on it.</v>

1467
01:13:37.471 --> 01:13:42.471
<v Speaker 2>It's we're spending too little on the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it would be a tremendous </v>

1468
01:13:42.471 --> 01:13:43.260
<v Speaker 2>discovery if we made it as far as </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

1469
01:13:43.290 --> 01:13:48.290
<v Speaker 2>It's worth listening because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he started back with Frank Drake </v>

1470
01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:48.960
<v Speaker 2>and carl sagan and others back in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sixties,</v>

1471
01:13:49.290 --> 01:13:54.290
<v Speaker 2>then they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No planets have been discovered beyond </v>

1472
01:13:54.290 --> 01:13:54.290
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beyond the solar system numb.</v>

1473
01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:58.830
<v Speaker 2>So you the only planet we knew our </v>
<v Speaker 2>planets now,</v>

1474
01:13:58.950 --> 01:14:03.950
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've discovered thousands of planets </v>

1475
01:14:03.950 --> 01:14:07.280
<v Speaker 2>confirm discoveries and the statistics </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you there are billions of them out </v>

1476
01:14:07.921 --> 01:14:12.921
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So virtually every style probably has a </v>

1477
01:14:12.921 --> 01:14:12.921
<v Speaker 2>planetary system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1478
01:14:12.921 --> 01:14:13.930
<v Speaker 2>so the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the statistics have gone in the favor of</v>

1479
01:14:13.931 --> 01:14:17.050
<v Speaker 2>seti from the astronomical perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as I say,</v>

1480
01:14:17.410 --> 01:14:21.400
<v Speaker 2>you've also got to have the time to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like us,</v>

1481
01:14:21.690 --> 01:14:22.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1482
01:14:22.210 --> 01:14:23.860
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a torturous process.</v>

1483
01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:26.470
<v Speaker 2>There's no inevitability to evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's not,</v>

1484
01:14:26.471 --> 01:14:27.030
<v Speaker 2>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1485
01:14:27.440 --> 01:14:32.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to be seen as some march to </v>

1486
01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:32.440
<v Speaker 2>complexity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Evolution is,</v>

1487
01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:32.440
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1488
01:14:32.440 --> 01:14:33.130
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does.</v>

1489
01:14:33.131 --> 01:14:35.860
<v Speaker 2>What it does is single celled organisms </v>
<v Speaker 2>were very,</v>

1490
01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:38.400
<v Speaker 2>very good at just surviving and getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>on with it for,</v>

1491
01:14:38.401 --> 01:14:43.401
<v Speaker 2>over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for most of the history of life on </v>

1492
01:14:43.401 --> 01:14:43.401
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>

1493
01:14:43.401 --> 01:14:45.870
<v Speaker 2>So it may be that complex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>multicellular life is kind of a just an </v>

1494
01:14:45.870 --> 01:14:45.970
<v Speaker 2>aberration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>

1495
01:14:45.971 --> 01:14:50.971
<v Speaker 2>It's just a bit of a lucky accident.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's all really just perspective when</v>

1496
01:14:51.611 --> 01:14:56.611
<v Speaker 2>you think about it because there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though there is enormous galaxy,</v>

1497
01:14:57.220 --> 01:15:02.220
<v Speaker 2>relatively speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one tiny on that big little thing </v>

1498
01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:03.160
<v Speaker 2>in comparison to the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>

1499
01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:07.030
<v Speaker 2>So even if we could find something out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1500
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:10.600
<v Speaker 2>the likelihood of it being as advanced </v>
<v Speaker 2>as us are very small,</v>

1501
01:15:10.850 --> 01:15:14.320
<v Speaker 2>but it's just a matter of how far we can</v>
<v Speaker 2>reach or how far we can see.</v>

1502
01:15:14.690 --> 01:15:17.690
<v Speaker 2>I w I wouldn't go there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>NobodY knows it.</v>

1503
01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:22.880
<v Speaker 2>The what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what people do now I think is that the </v>

1504
01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:23.920
<v Speaker 2>milky way is probably the boundary of </v>
<v Speaker 2>our aspirations.</v>

1505
01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:28.950
<v Speaker 2>It's for this generation or forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so what if we live a 100,000</v>

1506
01:15:30.311 --> 01:15:35.311
<v Speaker 2>years in public?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep the galaxies are hundred thousand </v>

1507
01:15:35.311 --> 01:15:37.180
<v Speaker 2>light years across the $200 million star</v>
<v Speaker 2>systems in it.</v>

1508
01:15:37.930 --> 01:15:40.140
<v Speaker 2>It's big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's too big it.</v>

1509
01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:41.710
<v Speaker 2>But that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not.</v>

1510
01:15:42.010 --> 01:15:47.010
<v Speaker 2>So you could just about perhaps conceive</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the far future of beginning to spread</v>

1511
01:15:48.041 --> 01:15:50.530
<v Speaker 2>out into the milky way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could conceive of that,</v>

1512
01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:54.550
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it given hundreds thousands of years,</v>

1513
01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:56.800
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then if you then you go,</v>

1514
01:15:56.801 --> 01:16:01.801
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where's the next galaxy andromeda to </v>

1515
01:16:01.801 --> 01:16:04.830
<v Speaker 2>over 2 million light years away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea that you would get across a </v>

1516
01:16:04.830 --> 01:16:08.881
<v Speaker 2>distance of 2 million light years with </v>
<v Speaker 2>any conceivable technology is to me </v>

1517
01:16:08.881 --> 01:16:09.790
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1518
01:16:09.791 --> 01:16:13.930
<v Speaker 2>it takes light a light beam to 2 million</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

1519
01:16:14.110 --> 01:16:16.150
<v Speaker 2>So if you want to talk to someone in </v>
<v Speaker 2>andromeda,</v>

1520
01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:18.050
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will take 200,</v>

1521
01:16:18.150 --> 01:16:23.150
<v Speaker 2>2 million years to get a message out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and 2 million years to get it </v>

1522
01:16:23.150 --> 01:16:23.910
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's a full million round trip.</v>

1523
01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:27.630
<v Speaker 2>That's the nearest galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's big,</v>

1524
01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:28.370
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's big,</v>

1525
01:16:28.870 --> 01:16:33.870
<v Speaker 2>but it's so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can imagine possibly the milky </v>

1526
01:16:33.870 --> 01:16:33.870
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

1527
01:16:33.870 --> 01:16:36.100
<v Speaker 2>It's some chance if there are other </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilizations there talking to them.</v>

1528
01:16:36.610 --> 01:16:39.490
<v Speaker 2>But I think beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just cannot conceive of how it will be</v>

1529
01:16:39.491 --> 01:16:43.570
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this relative though a perspective to</v>

1530
01:16:43.571 --> 01:16:48.571
<v Speaker 2>the single celled organisms that existed</v>
<v Speaker 2>billions of years ago in comparison to </v>

1531
01:16:48.571 --> 01:16:52.321
<v Speaker 2>us?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do we really think that we're the end </v>

1532
01:16:52.321 --> 01:16:52.321
<v Speaker 2>all be all?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is the last stop on the road to</v>

1533
01:16:52.321 --> 01:16:56.821
<v Speaker 2>evolution isn't impossible that we get </v>
<v Speaker 2>so advanced if we lIve to be another </v>

1534
01:16:56.821 --> 01:17:00.460
<v Speaker 2>billion years that we Can all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideas that we have in oUr head about the</v>

1535
01:17:00.461 --> 01:17:02.690
<v Speaker 2>laws of space and time and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1536
01:17:02.691 --> 01:17:07.691
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what particle physicists are trying to </v>

1537
01:17:07.691 --> 01:17:10.040
<v Speaker 2>figure out and what string theorists are</v>
<v Speaker 2>prescribing as far as,</v>

1538
01:17:10.041 --> 01:17:15.041
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 different dimensions that we just </v>

1539
01:17:15.041 --> 01:17:16.750
<v Speaker 2>send it to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that that's pretty unfair to </v>

1540
01:17:16.750 --> 01:17:20.291
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I want to get into that because I </v>

1541
01:17:20.291 --> 01:17:20.291
<v Speaker 2>don't understand string theory.</v>

1542
01:17:20.291 --> 01:17:20.291
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1543
01:17:20.291 --> 01:17:23.610
<v Speaker 2>but I understand what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either my.</v>

1544
01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:27.860
<v Speaker 2>But my idea is that if we continue to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the same path,</v>

1545
01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:33.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean isn't it possible that we will </v>
<v Speaker 2>achieve some unfathomable level of </v>

1546
01:17:33.321 --> 01:17:38.321
<v Speaker 2>technological proficiency or have </v>
<v Speaker 2>control over matter or have or have an </v>

1547
01:17:39.081 --> 01:17:44.081
<v Speaker 2>understanding of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's such a deep level that we can </v>

1548
01:17:44.090 --> 01:17:46.820
<v Speaker 2>violate all these things that we now </v>
<v Speaker 2>consider laws.</v>

1549
01:17:46.821 --> 01:17:48.170
<v Speaker 2>Like the laws of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1550
01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:51.470
<v Speaker 2>So the laws would have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>approximation as to some deeper laws.</v>

1551
01:17:51.810 --> 01:17:54.950
<v Speaker 2>They're the einstein's theories of </v>
<v Speaker 2>relativity.</v>

1552
01:17:55.390 --> 01:17:58.910
<v Speaker 2>The best theories we have at the moment </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have space and time,</v>

1553
01:17:59.130 --> 01:18:04.130
<v Speaker 2>space time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thank god for einstein and well it </v>

1554
01:18:04.130 --> 01:18:06.020
<v Speaker 2>wasn't general relativity actually 100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years old this year.</v>

1555
01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:09.940
<v Speaker 2>So that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing and I'm so the,</v>

1556
01:18:10.020 --> 01:18:15.020
<v Speaker 2>the speed of light as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a fundamental part of the structure </v>

1557
01:18:15.171 --> 01:18:17.960
<v Speaker 2>of space and time actually is central to</v>
<v Speaker 2>that theory.</v>

1558
01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:22.250
<v Speaker 2>It's actually the thing that protects </v>
<v Speaker 2>and cause and effect.</v>

1559
01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:27.460
<v Speaker 2>So it protects if you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the past from the present and the </v>

1560
01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:27.460
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it,</v>

1561
01:18:27.460 --> 01:18:30.260
<v Speaker 2>it's built in in a very fundamental way </v>
<v Speaker 2>to that theory.</v>

1562
01:18:30.830 --> 01:18:33.100
<v Speaker 2>So you are right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in principle that.</v>

1563
01:18:33.530 --> 01:18:35.420
<v Speaker 2>And it's a speed limit in that theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way.</v>

1564
01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:38.270
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are strange things happened as you</v>

1565
01:18:38.271 --> 01:18:39.920
<v Speaker 2>approach the speed of light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

1566
01:18:39.921 --> 01:18:44.270
<v Speaker 2>the theory says that time slows down </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that's traveling relative to us.</v>

1567
01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:49.390
<v Speaker 2>So if someone there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the number I know is the number for the </v>

1568
01:18:49.390 --> 01:18:50.150
<v Speaker 2>protons in the lhc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the protons go 99 point nine,</v>

1569
01:18:50.151 --> 01:18:50.630
<v Speaker 2>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine,</v>

1570
01:18:50.631 --> 01:18:51.080
<v Speaker 2>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nine,</v>

1571
01:18:51.081 --> 01:18:53.190
<v Speaker 2>nine percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The speed of light at that.</v>

1572
01:18:53.300 --> 01:18:58.300
<v Speaker 2>So imagine one of those flying pastors </v>
<v Speaker 2>now and you imagine it at a watch for </v>

1573
01:18:58.300 --> 01:19:02.391
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suddenly the watch and you'd see it's </v>

1574
01:19:02.391 --> 01:19:04.691
<v Speaker 2>what past 7,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>times more slowly our watch it and it </v>

1575
01:19:04.691 --> 01:19:06.860
<v Speaker 2>would live 7,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>times more slowly than those.</v>

1576
01:19:07.010 --> 01:19:08.960
<v Speaker 2>So conversely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it was watching us,</v>

1577
01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:09.650
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1578
01:19:09.690 --> 01:19:10.220
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1579
01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:13.430
<v Speaker 2>that it would see the same effect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can,</v>

1580
01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:17.330
<v Speaker 2>so you can move through time at </v>
<v Speaker 2>different rates,</v>

1581
01:19:17.331 --> 01:19:22.331
<v Speaker 2>essentially united starting this theory </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the faster you go relative to </v>

1582
01:19:22.331 --> 01:19:22.340
<v Speaker 2>somebody else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the slower your watch ticks.</v>

1583
01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:27.460
<v Speaker 2>I got an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We combine your world and the </v>

1584
01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:29.240
<v Speaker 2>kardashians and we shoot them in a space</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the speed of light and they don't age</v>

1585
01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:30.800
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>

1586
01:19:30.801 --> 01:19:32.630
<v Speaker 2>So exactly what you said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cool thing about.</v>

1587
01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:37.920
<v Speaker 2>That's what I was going to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing about relativity is if you go </v>

1588
01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:38.390
<v Speaker 2>at the speed of light,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't age,</v>

1589
01:19:38.420 --> 01:19:43.220
<v Speaker 2>no time passes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that kind of pointed.</v>

1590
01:19:43.250 --> 01:19:45.290
<v Speaker 2>You can't go at the speed of light </v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you're massless.</v>

1591
01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:47.760
<v Speaker 2>But that's kind of tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he'd be a message.</v>

1592
01:19:47.770 --> 01:19:52.770
<v Speaker 2>You have to have you ever seen her ass?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good luck making that thing massless </v>

1593
01:19:52.770 --> 01:19:52.770
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

1594
01:19:52.770 --> 01:19:55.430
<v Speaker 2>It's so be limited to travel below the </v>
<v Speaker 2>speed of light,</v>

1595
01:19:55.920 --> 01:20:00.920
<v Speaker 2>not just you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if she only weighed only one gram </v>

1596
01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:02.230
<v Speaker 2>in mass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's such a lot more than that.</v>

1597
01:20:02.850 --> 01:20:06.080
<v Speaker 2>Plus that's not a very aerodynamic </v>
<v Speaker 2>object either.</v>

1598
01:20:06.090 --> 01:20:07.950
<v Speaker 2>So we're launching that sucker.</v>

1599
01:20:08.210 --> 01:20:08.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

1600
01:20:08.701 --> 01:20:10.530
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't matter in space because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>a vacuum.</v>

1601
01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:14.150
<v Speaker 1>So you're all right today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're dynamics still.</v>

1602
01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:16.640
<v Speaker 1>So it's a fundamental thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

1603
01:20:16.641 --> 01:20:21.641
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're going at that fundamental </v>

1604
01:20:21.641 --> 01:20:21.641
<v Speaker 1>speed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no time,</v>

1605
01:20:21.641 --> 01:20:26.180
<v Speaker 1>there's no distance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually there all the distances shrink </v>

1606
01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:26.180
<v Speaker 1>to zero.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a,</v>

1607
01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:27.810
<v Speaker 1>it's a long dress aids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fundamental part of the structure</v>

1608
01:20:27.811 --> 01:20:29.880
<v Speaker 1>of space and time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's always been possible.</v>

1609
01:20:29.910 --> 01:20:34.910
<v Speaker 1>So you would need a different theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's literally impossible change </v>

1610
01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:37.810
<v Speaker 1>theory to go at the speed of light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're massless engage,</v>

1611
01:20:37.860 --> 01:20:39.380
<v Speaker 1>you have to go at the speed of light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ken,</v>

1612
01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:44.420
<v Speaker 1>could you go just under the speed of </v>
<v Speaker 1>light and then time would just slowed </v>

1613
01:20:44.420 --> 01:20:45.750
<v Speaker 1>down so it wouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't,</v>

1614
01:20:45.751 --> 01:20:48.930
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't stop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would slow drastically.</v>

1615
01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:49.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1616
01:20:49.891 --> 01:20:51.200
<v Speaker 1>So as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>99 point nine,</v>

1617
01:20:51.201 --> 01:20:51.570
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>

1618
01:20:51.571 --> 01:20:51.990
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>

1619
01:20:51.991 --> 01:20:54.600
<v Speaker 1>nine percent gives you a factor of </v>
<v Speaker 1>7,000.</v>

1620
01:20:54.870 --> 01:20:59.870
<v Speaker 1>Now here's the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you somehow or another we're able to </v>

1621
01:20:59.870 --> 01:20:59.990
<v Speaker 1>go 99 point nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine,</v>

1622
01:20:59.991 --> 01:21:04.890
<v Speaker 1>nine percent of the speed of light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would happen in your perspective as</v>

1623
01:21:04.891 --> 01:21:07.140
<v Speaker 1>far as time would?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would time,</v>

1624
01:21:07.230 --> 01:21:09.400
<v Speaker 1>normal rate and their normal rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1625
01:21:09.450 --> 01:21:12.340
<v Speaker 1>So you would age at a normal rate in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your perspective?</v>

1626
01:21:12.341 --> 01:21:14.310
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But back home,</v>

1627
01:21:14.311 --> 01:21:19.311
<v Speaker 1>like if you came back around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you went out into space and you went </v>

1628
01:21:19.311 --> 01:21:19.890
<v Speaker 1>10 years at the speed of light and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1629
01:21:19.891 --> 01:21:20.910
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you came back,</v>

1630
01:21:20.970 --> 01:21:23.460
<v Speaker 1>everything would change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'd be exactly the same.</v>

1631
01:21:23.470 --> 01:21:26.130
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would change for you though?</v>

1632
01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:28.800
<v Speaker 1>Something has to change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if the distances.</v>

1633
01:21:29.150 --> 01:21:34.150
<v Speaker 1>So if you travel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the other thing is let's talk about </v>

1634
01:21:34.150 --> 01:21:35.300
<v Speaker 1>the protons in the lhc again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're their,</v>

1635
01:21:35.301 --> 01:21:40.301
<v Speaker 1>they're their times past in 7,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>signs more slowly from the perspective </v>

1636
01:21:40.301 --> 01:21:41.370
<v Speaker 1>of someone stood on the ground watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>them go round,</v>

1637
01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:44.250
<v Speaker 1>but from their perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>time's going at the same rate,</v>

1638
01:21:44.310 --> 01:21:45.870
<v Speaker 1>but something must change.</v>

1639
01:21:45.870 --> 01:21:47.370
<v Speaker 1>So what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The distance.</v>

1640
01:21:47.610 --> 01:21:52.170
<v Speaker 1>So the lhc is no longer 16 miles in </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumference,</v>

1641
01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:55.030
<v Speaker 1>it's about now I know the number in </v>
<v Speaker 1>metric,</v>

1642
01:21:55.031 --> 01:22:00.031
<v Speaker 1>so it's four meters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's what is that in three feet or </v>

1643
01:22:00.031 --> 01:22:00.690
<v Speaker 1>meters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like three point zero feet.</v>

1644
01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:01.270
<v Speaker 1>Twelve feet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1645
01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:06.760
<v Speaker 1>So it's titled feet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's squashes and so distance is </v>

1646
01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:08.220
<v Speaker 1>shrink from the perspective of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>protons,</v>

1647
01:22:08.610 --> 01:22:12.660
<v Speaker 1>so time passes at the same rate that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>normal rate for them for on their watch,</v>

1648
01:22:12.900 --> 01:22:17.280
<v Speaker 1>but the distances seem to seem to shrink</v>
<v Speaker 1>or do shrink not seem to.</v>

1649
01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:22.340
<v Speaker 1>They do deep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you concerned at all about </v>

1650
01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:26.720
<v Speaker 1>artificial life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you concerned at all about the </v>

1651
01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:30.800
<v Speaker 1>creation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the inevitable creation of something </v>

1652
01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:34.580
<v Speaker 1>that in some way replicates independent </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought and acts on its own accord?</v>

1653
01:22:35.370 --> 01:22:40.370
<v Speaker 1>I always wonder if human beings are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a sense a technological </v>

1654
01:22:41.881 --> 01:22:46.881
<v Speaker 1>caterpillar that's becoming a butterfly </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we just don't realize it in all of </v>

1655
01:22:46.881 --> 01:22:50.841
<v Speaker 1>our work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at one of the things that </v>

1656
01:22:50.841 --> 01:22:50.841
<v Speaker 1>human beings are absolutely fascinated </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

1657
01:22:50.841 --> 01:22:55.101
<v Speaker 1>whether or not it benefits us or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're fascinated with technological </v>

1658
01:22:55.101 --> 01:22:55.920
<v Speaker 1>innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we want faster computers,</v>

1659
01:22:55.921 --> 01:22:57.720
<v Speaker 1>even if we don't even have applications </v>
<v Speaker 1>for them,</v>

1660
01:22:58.050 --> 01:23:00.450
<v Speaker 1>we want cars that goes zero to 60 in two</v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds.</v>

1661
01:23:00.630 --> 01:23:03.800
<v Speaker 1>We want everything to go quicker and </v>
<v Speaker 1>better and we we,</v>

1662
01:23:03.830 --> 01:23:06.010
<v Speaker 1>we don't get satisfied.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody ever looks</v>

1663
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:07.690
<v Speaker 4>at computers and goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're good,</v>

1664
01:23:07.930 --> 01:23:10.000
<v Speaker 4>we're good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We don't need a bigger laptop.</v>

1665
01:23:10.001 --> 01:23:12.670
<v Speaker 4>We don't need a stronger hard drive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everything seemed fine.</v>

1666
01:23:12.790 --> 01:23:16.700
<v Speaker 4>Let's stop innovating on computers and </v>
<v Speaker 4>move towards cancer research or no,</v>

1667
01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:18.430
<v Speaker 4>we will never.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're never going to stop.</v>

1668
01:23:18.610 --> 01:23:22.780
<v Speaker 4>And I always wonder if what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whatever drives us.</v>

1669
01:23:22.930 --> 01:23:27.930
<v Speaker 4>What if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what if is similar in some way to </v>

1670
01:23:27.930 --> 01:23:31.350
<v Speaker 4>caterpillar building a cocoon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get about to give birth to this new </v>

1671
01:23:31.350 --> 01:23:33.340
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Totally unaware and that artificial life</v>

1672
01:23:33.341 --> 01:23:38.341
<v Speaker 4>that our work with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's code or whether it's </v>

1673
01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:43.210
<v Speaker 4>electronics or whether it's three d </v>
<v Speaker 4>printing,</v>

1674
01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:48.360
<v Speaker 4>a combination of all those technologies </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming together to create some new form </v>

1675
01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:52.921
<v Speaker 4>of life and we don't think of life being</v>
<v Speaker 4>possible in an electronic sense because </v>

1676
01:23:52.921 --> 01:23:57.901
<v Speaker 4>we think of life as being cells and </v>
<v Speaker 4>blood and all the things that we are,</v>

1677
01:23:58.450 --> 01:24:03.450
<v Speaker 4>but is it possible that we might just be</v>
<v Speaker 4>building the next thing that you know,</v>

1678
01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:04.510
<v Speaker 4>we look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1679
01:24:04.511 --> 01:24:06.520
<v Speaker 4>we've only been alive for 200,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

1680
01:24:06.790 --> 01:24:11.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we might be shitting out the new </v>

1681
01:24:11.790 --> 01:24:14.341
<v Speaker 4>version of life with our constant </v>
<v Speaker 4>fascination with materialism.</v>

1682
01:24:15.570 --> 01:24:17.290
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is materialism ultimately,</v>

1683
01:24:17.291 --> 01:24:21.140
<v Speaker 4>if not a push for innovation and </v>
<v Speaker 4>technology?</v>

1684
01:24:21.141 --> 01:24:24.490
<v Speaker 4>A big part of what materialism is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is keeping up with the jones' is getting</v>

1685
01:24:24.491 --> 01:24:26.050
<v Speaker 4>the latest and greatest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at this.</v>

1686
01:24:26.051 --> 01:24:29.830
<v Speaker 4>This guy has got a new tv.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It sees your fucking brain.</v>

1687
01:24:29.831 --> 01:24:31.120
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it looks through your soul.</v>

1688
01:24:31.130 --> 01:24:33.330
<v Speaker 4>You could play back your history.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know it,</v>

1689
01:24:33.331 --> 01:24:35.770
<v Speaker 4>it gets a fingerprint it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You read it,</v>

1690
01:24:35.771 --> 01:24:39.190
<v Speaker 4>it takes your dna and it shows you what </v>
<v Speaker 4>your ancestors were doing.</v>

1691
01:24:39.191 --> 01:24:40.690
<v Speaker 4>Two billion years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1692
01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:41.770
<v Speaker 4>well there's another aspects</v>

1693
01:24:41.770 --> 01:24:46.770
<v Speaker 2>of r and d besides consumerism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't that the increased life </v>

1694
01:24:46.770 --> 01:24:46.770
<v Speaker 2>expectancy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>decreased child mortality,</v>

1695
01:24:46.770 --> 01:24:48.980
<v Speaker 2>although of great things too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I agree with you.</v>

1696
01:24:49.010 --> 01:24:54.010
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see any reason why I'm ai is in </v>

1697
01:24:54.111 --> 01:24:59.111
<v Speaker 2>principle not possible because I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that although you know the research,</v>

1698
01:25:01.041 --> 01:25:03.440
<v Speaker 2>we don't understand the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it must,</v>

1699
01:25:03.441 --> 01:25:07.160
<v Speaker 2>it must be an object that operates in </v>
<v Speaker 2>accord with the laws of physics.</v>

1700
01:25:07.430 --> 01:25:07.840
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1701
01:25:07.850 --> 01:25:12.850
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I strongly suspect that our conscious </v>

1702
01:25:12.850 --> 01:25:13.130
<v Speaker 2>experience is emergent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it emerges.</v>

1703
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:15.290
<v Speaker 2>So there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an algorithm there.</v>

1704
01:25:15.510 --> 01:25:20.510
<v Speaker 2>Very complex algorithm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't see why it can't be </v>

1705
01:25:20.510 --> 01:25:21.230
<v Speaker 2>simulated in a sufficiently powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>computer in principle.</v>

1706
01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:24.260
<v Speaker 2>So I don't see why you can't have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>conscious competer.</v>

1707
01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:27.560
<v Speaker 2>I don't personally see why you can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Therefore,</v>

1708
01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:30.950
<v Speaker 2>if that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can given them and as you say,</v>

1709
01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:31.420
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1710
01:25:31.421 --> 01:25:33.340
<v Speaker 2>the rate of increase in computing power.</v>

1711
01:25:33.350 --> 01:25:35.270
<v Speaker 2>Is it rapid?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not there yet.</v>

1712
01:25:35.540 --> 01:25:40.540
<v Speaker 2>There is a project in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in europe are very big project to build </v>

1713
01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:41.210
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a brain simulator.</v>

1714
01:25:41.390 --> 01:25:44.030
<v Speaker 2>It's a long way off and you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about billions of dollars,</v>

1715
01:25:44.090 --> 01:25:45.740
<v Speaker 2>but I'm at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1716
01:25:45.741 --> 01:25:49.790
<v Speaker 2>as you say that 40 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a billion dollars when you vote,</v>

1717
01:25:49.791 --> 01:25:52.210
<v Speaker 2>you have an iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>

1718
01:25:52.250 --> 01:25:53.270
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1719
01:25:53.290 --> 01:25:58.290
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and actually energy said three d </v>

1720
01:25:58.290 --> 01:26:01.451
<v Speaker 2>printers a essentially seem to be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first step on the road to self </v>

1721
01:26:01.451 --> 01:26:05.721
<v Speaker 2>replicating machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you've the computing power that can </v>

1722
01:26:05.721 --> 01:26:07.970
<v Speaker 2>be intelligent and you've got a means of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it being a replicator.</v>

1723
01:26:08.420 --> 01:26:11.600
<v Speaker 2>Then I don't see why you can't build ais</v>
<v Speaker 2>that replicate.</v>

1724
01:26:12.020 --> 01:26:14.750
<v Speaker 2>And actually going back to the cosmology</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a minute,</v>

1725
01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:18.410
<v Speaker 2>one of the arguments against the </v>
<v Speaker 2>existence of civilizations,</v>

1726
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:24.430
<v Speaker 2>more advanced civilizations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nose in the milky way is that they </v>

1727
01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:24.430
<v Speaker 2>would have done that.</v>

1728
01:26:24.820 --> 01:26:28.670
<v Speaker 2>And this is an argument from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mathematician called paul nyman and also</v>

1729
01:26:28.671 --> 01:26:31.070
<v Speaker 2>a physicist called fermi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called the fermi paradox.</v>

1730
01:26:31.340 --> 01:26:34.260
<v Speaker 2>That let's assume that let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's fast forward a ge said,</v>

1731
01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:36.890
<v Speaker 2>let's fastforward our civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ten thousand years,</v>

1732
01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:39.050
<v Speaker 2>leT's say blink of an eye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>

1733
01:26:39.170 --> 01:26:44.170
<v Speaker 2>We'Ve only been around for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've been around for less than that as </v>

1734
01:26:44.170 --> 01:26:44.170
<v Speaker 2>a civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's aa 10,000.</v>

1735
01:26:44.170 --> 01:26:47.270
<v Speaker 2>What are we going to look like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will we have built self replicating ais?</v>

1736
01:26:47.870 --> 01:26:52.870
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless there's some reason in principle </v>

1737
01:26:52.870 --> 01:26:52.870
<v Speaker 2>why you count.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do you do?</v>

1738
01:26:52.870 --> 01:26:55.100
<v Speaker 2>You send those out there replicators.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can go to asteroids.</v>

1739
01:26:55.101 --> 01:26:58.310
<v Speaker 2>Mine print three d print a version of </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves,</v>

1740
01:26:58.340 --> 01:27:03.340
<v Speaker 2>go off again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>they exponentiate they can crawl over </v>

1741
01:27:03.340 --> 01:27:04.220
<v Speaker 2>the galaxy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exploring for free.</v>

1742
01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:07.280
<v Speaker 2>They send them out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we see no evidence of those things.</v>

1743
01:27:07.281 --> 01:27:11.210
<v Speaker 2>And they called von neumann machines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's one of the great.</v>

1744
01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:16.360
<v Speaker 2>You can either say that there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>something in principle that stops you </v>

1745
01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:19.301
<v Speaker 2>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So actually there is something special </v>

1746
01:27:19.301 --> 01:27:21.581
<v Speaker 2>about intelligence and you just can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>with some reason why you can't build a </v>

1747
01:27:21.581 --> 01:27:23.060
<v Speaker 2>computer that's artificially </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligent.</v>

1748
01:27:23.061 --> 01:27:25.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't see why that would be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1749
01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:27.390
<v Speaker 2>you could argue you can't build the self</v>
<v Speaker 2>replicating,</v>

1750
01:27:27.391 --> 01:27:32.391
<v Speaker 2>but you can because we are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're replicators and we operate in </v>

1751
01:27:32.391 --> 01:27:32.391
<v Speaker 2>accord with the laws of physics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there.</v>

1752
01:27:32.391 --> 01:27:37.120
<v Speaker 2>So there's a replicated or the reason we</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't see them is because there aren't </v>

1753
01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:40.130
<v Speaker 2>any civilizations that ever got to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>level in the milky way.</v>

1754
01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:42.730
<v Speaker 2>So we're the tip of the spear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one what?</v>

1755
01:27:42.731 --> 01:27:44.280
<v Speaker 2>We can't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We couldn't be the first.</v>

1756
01:27:44.380 --> 01:27:46.520
<v Speaker 2>It's very difficult to see how we could </v>
<v Speaker 2>be the first.</v>

1757
01:27:46.521 --> 01:27:48.200
<v Speaker 2>Someone has to be the first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why can't it be us?</v>

1758
01:27:48.230 --> 01:27:53.230
<v Speaker 2>But because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the milky way has been around </v>

1759
01:27:53.230 --> 01:27:53.230
<v Speaker 2>for the age of the universal use.</v>

1760
01:27:53.230 --> 01:27:55.490
<v Speaker 2>Say don't you know the earth is 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years old,</v>

1761
01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:57.050
<v Speaker 2>do you not go on with the [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 2>side?</v>

1762
01:27:58.490 --> 01:28:03.490
<v Speaker 2>So the timescales,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking billions of years really </v>

1763
01:28:03.490 --> 01:28:03.490
<v Speaker 2>into planets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>billions of years,</v>

1764
01:28:03.490 --> 01:28:07.080
<v Speaker 2>but it has to happen in a one time was </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere and then sudden.</v>

1765
01:28:07.130 --> 01:28:11.750
<v Speaker 2>And if you get one wave of these ais </v>
<v Speaker 2>away into space,</v>

1766
01:28:12.290 --> 01:28:17.290
<v Speaker 2>then you can show using computer models </v>
<v Speaker 2>with realistic assumptions about rocky </v>

1767
01:28:17.290 --> 01:28:21.651
<v Speaker 2>power and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can cover the galaxy in on </v>

1768
01:28:21.651 --> 01:28:23.130
<v Speaker 2>timescales of much less than a billion </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

1769
01:28:23.180 --> 01:28:26.240
<v Speaker 2>Actually million years less than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a.</v>

1770
01:28:26.241 --> 01:28:29.540
<v Speaker 2>You can shoW that you can cover the </v>
<v Speaker 2>galaxy and your von neumann probes.</v>

1771
01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:31.960
<v Speaker 2>You're replicators in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1772
01:28:32.090 --> 01:28:34.520
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say a million,</v>

1773
01:28:34.521 --> 01:28:35.420
<v Speaker 2>2 million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>3 million,</v>

1774
01:28:35.421 --> 01:28:40.421
<v Speaker 2>10 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't matter because we've got </v>

1775
01:28:40.421 --> 01:28:40.421
<v Speaker 2>billions of years and yet we see no </v>
<v Speaker 2>evidence of them,</v>

1776
01:28:40.421 --> 01:28:42.050
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what are we to make of that?</v>

1777
01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:47.800
<v Speaker 2>Either there's something wrong with our </v>
<v Speaker 2>arguments that we're putting forward </v>

1778
01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:49.340
<v Speaker 2>that actually you can't build self </v>
<v Speaker 2>replicating intelligent robots.</v>

1779
01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:54.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't see why not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe there's something wrong with </v>

1780
01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:56.681
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or really civilizations are so rare that</v>

1781
01:28:57.020 --> 01:28:59.960
<v Speaker 2>as you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are the first to get to that level,</v>

1782
01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:01.530
<v Speaker 2>but that's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

1783
01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:06.560
<v Speaker 2>That that will be an interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always think I'm a segue sentence to </v>

1784
01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:10.951
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so imagine we're the only civilization </v>

1785
01:29:10.951 --> 01:29:14.001
<v Speaker 2>in the galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What a tremendous responsibility there </v>

1786
01:29:14.001 --> 01:29:15.570
<v Speaker 2>is honors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine what that knowledge should do to</v>

1787
01:29:15.571 --> 01:29:18.270
<v Speaker 2>our political processes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way that we think about ourselves,</v>

1788
01:29:18.271 --> 01:29:23.271
<v Speaker 2>the way that we get on together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine how ridiculous it is to divide </v>

1789
01:29:23.271 --> 01:29:26.550
<v Speaker 2>our little world or into countries and </v>
<v Speaker 2>another little war every now and again,</v>

1790
01:29:26.551 --> 01:29:27.930
<v Speaker 2>important nuclear missiles at each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>

1791
01:29:28.050 --> 01:29:33.050
<v Speaker 2>if in fact there's nowhere else in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>milky way galaxy where anybody thinks </v>

1792
01:29:33.050 --> 01:29:36.420
<v Speaker 2>anybody can look at the styles and think</v>
<v Speaker 2>about and have these conversations.</v>

1793
01:29:36.750 --> 01:29:41.750
<v Speaker 2>What a ridiculous way to behave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think the cosmology is gives a </v>

1794
01:29:42.571 --> 01:29:46.920
<v Speaker 2>perspective which is not necessarily </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to be humbling,</v>

1795
01:29:46.950 --> 01:29:48.900
<v Speaker 2>it is humbling and that's perhaps a good</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

1796
01:29:49.230 --> 01:29:49.830
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't need.</v>

1797
01:29:49.830 --> 01:29:53.640
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to be depressed about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It could be quite elating you say,</v>

1798
01:29:53.641 --> 01:29:58.641
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with what we are according to the </v>

1799
01:29:58.641 --> 01:29:59.700
<v Speaker 2>evidence and the data at the moment is </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost indescribably special.</v>

1800
01:30:00.150 --> 01:30:02.100
<v Speaker 2>Our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our tininess,</v>

1801
01:30:02.380 --> 01:30:07.380
<v Speaker 2>our potential uniqueness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our insignificance in a cosmic scale </v>

1802
01:30:08.700 --> 01:30:11.520
<v Speaker 2>actually makes us special because we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>the only place.</v>

1803
01:30:11.780 --> 01:30:12.750
<v Speaker 2>And so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these,</v>

1804
01:30:12.780 --> 01:30:17.780
<v Speaker 2>these ideas are worth pursuing I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>because they make you think about these </v>

1805
01:30:18.361 --> 01:30:20.700
<v Speaker 2>issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't it also point to our ego that we</v>

1806
01:30:20.701 --> 01:30:25.701
<v Speaker 2>think that our biological processes any </v>
<v Speaker 2>more important than the exploding sons </v>

1807
01:30:25.701 --> 01:30:28.540
<v Speaker 2>that are required to create carbon life </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the first place or,</v>

1808
01:30:28.810 --> 01:30:33.810
<v Speaker 2>or any of the processes of the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The answer that I think is that you're </v>

1809
01:30:33.810 --> 01:30:33.810
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in a,</v>

1810
01:30:33.810 --> 01:30:34.920
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a signal,</v>

1811
01:30:35.010 --> 01:30:40.010
<v Speaker 2>in a completely logical sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we no more important or less important </v>

1812
01:30:40.010 --> 01:30:41.580
<v Speaker 2>than the stars themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right,</v>

1813
01:30:41.581 --> 01:30:42.720
<v Speaker 2>which is natural objects.</v>

1814
01:30:43.110 --> 01:30:48.110
<v Speaker 2>But I would counter by saying that </v>
<v Speaker 2>people look for meaning in the universe.</v>

1815
01:30:48.421 --> 01:30:53.421
<v Speaker 2>People like to look for meaning gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>this one thing that we've done since we </v>

1816
01:30:53.421 --> 01:30:55.530
<v Speaker 2>began to look at the stars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The universe means something to me,</v>

1817
01:30:55.640 --> 01:30:56.550
<v Speaker 2>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does.</v>

1818
01:30:56.580 --> 01:30:59.340
<v Speaker 2>Meaning exists because it means </v>
<v Speaker 2>something to us.</v>

1819
01:30:59.370 --> 01:31:02.910
<v Speaker 2>So we know that it would be ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 2>to say the university is meaningless.</v>

1820
01:31:02.911 --> 01:31:04.890
<v Speaker 2>It means something in my relatively our </v>
<v Speaker 2>families,</v>

1821
01:31:04.891 --> 01:31:05.790
<v Speaker 2>we have loved ones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>etc.</v>

1822
01:31:06.390 --> 01:31:09.660
<v Speaker 2>So the fact that that meaning might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>emergent,</v>

1823
01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:14.160
<v Speaker 2>it might appear from the laws of nature </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it is almost certainly transient.</v>

1824
01:31:14.430 --> 01:31:16.530
<v Speaker 2>Unless we build these self replicating </v>
<v Speaker 2>machines,</v>

1825
01:31:16.531 --> 01:31:21.531
<v Speaker 2>we will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to last forever as a </v>

1826
01:31:21.531 --> 01:31:21.531
<v Speaker 2>civilization probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that to me,</v>

1827
01:31:21.531 --> 01:31:24.420
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't in any way water down the </v>
<v Speaker 2>significance of it.</v>

1828
01:31:25.050 --> 01:31:28.410
<v Speaker 2>So I think again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cosmology can be,</v>

1829
01:31:28.740 --> 01:31:30.950
<v Speaker 2>can be a poWerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1830
01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:36.080
<v Speaker 2>aid to philosophical thoughts in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense because you have to accept that </v>

1831
01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:37.110
<v Speaker 2>there's meaning in the universe because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it means something to us.</v>

1832
01:31:37.410 --> 01:31:41.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't see why it has to be eternal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see why there was that meaning,</v>

1833
01:31:41.331 --> 01:31:43.650
<v Speaker 2>does it imply purpose?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's any purpose to the</v>

1834
01:31:43.651 --> 01:31:45.990
<v Speaker 2>universe brings any point to our </v>
<v Speaker 2>existence.</v>

1835
01:31:46.410 --> 01:31:49.890
<v Speaker 2>But the fact that we exist at all is </v>
<v Speaker 2>worth celebrating.</v>

1836
01:31:50.160 --> 01:31:52.020
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to add anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

1837
01:31:52.021 --> 01:31:53.730
<v Speaker 2>you almost did it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're devalued it.</v>

1838
01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:55.980
<v Speaker 2>So why would you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is remarkable.</v>

1839
01:31:56.130 --> 01:31:59.830
<v Speaker 2>We emerged a single celled organisms </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably before that.</v>

1840
01:31:59.831 --> 01:31:59.930
<v Speaker 2>We</v>

1841
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:03.400
<v Speaker 3>emerged some chemical reactions in in </v>
<v Speaker 3>hydrothermal vents,</v>

1842
01:32:03.401 --> 01:32:08.401
<v Speaker 3>probably down in the deep primordial </v>
<v Speaker 3>oceans of ancient earth and over three </v>

1843
01:32:08.401 --> 01:32:09.730
<v Speaker 3>point 8 billion years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've come to the point where we can sit</v>

1844
01:32:09.731 --> 01:32:12.550
<v Speaker 3>and think about the styles and have </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations like this.</v>

1845
01:32:12.820 --> 01:32:17.680
<v Speaker 3>Is that not enough?</v>
<v Speaker 3>can we just leave it there?</v>

1846
01:32:17.980 --> 01:32:20.800
<v Speaker 3>Why does it have to be a point?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There isn't a point.</v>

1847
01:32:20.920 --> 01:32:23.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's appalling to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's worth celebrating.</v>

1848
01:32:24.340 --> 01:32:26.140
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it certainly is to us.</v>

1849
01:32:26.380 --> 01:32:27.460
<v Speaker 3>To us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing,</v>

1850
01:32:27.461 --> 01:32:32.461
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a lot of ways isn't looking </v>

1851
01:32:32.461 --> 01:32:34.600
<v Speaker 3>throughout the incredible cosmos for </v>
<v Speaker 3>signs of life,</v>

1852
01:32:34.780 --> 01:32:39.250
<v Speaker 3>like looking in a sea of parked mercedes</v>
<v Speaker 3>benz for dust,</v>

1853
01:32:39.640 --> 01:32:42.070
<v Speaker 3>like one of these cars must be fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>dusty.</v>

1854
01:32:43.150 --> 01:32:44.830
<v Speaker 3>JuSt cleaned them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to find it.</v>

1855
01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:48.580
<v Speaker 3>And you're ignoring the incredible </v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanisms that are in front of you.</v>

1856
01:32:48.581 --> 01:32:51.460
<v Speaker 3>There's an amazing technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>antilock brakes.</v>

1857
01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:54.970
<v Speaker 3>Fucking 12 inch computer screens that </v>
<v Speaker 3>ended up gauges anymore.</v>

1858
01:32:55.140 --> 01:32:57.610
<v Speaker 3>The cars drive for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they steer for you,</v>

1859
01:32:57.611 --> 01:32:59.170
<v Speaker 3>they break for you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're like,</v>

1860
01:32:59.171 --> 01:33:02.050
<v Speaker 3>one of these motherfuckers has dust on </v>
<v Speaker 3>it just like us.</v>

1861
01:33:05.230 --> 01:33:10.230
<v Speaker 3>These planets,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and we talked about our planet being </v>

1862
01:33:10.230 --> 01:33:11.560
<v Speaker 3>four point 6 billion years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>the universe is 13 point eight.</v>

1863
01:33:11.650 --> 01:33:16.650
<v Speaker 3>We're looking for things that live 100 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years were like just got to be one out </v>

1864
01:33:16.650 --> 01:33:19.861
<v Speaker 3>there that sing songs somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a better rapper than jay zed and</v>

1865
01:33:21.551 --> 01:33:23.910
<v Speaker 3>he's out there in the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got to find him.</v>

1866
01:33:25.140 --> 01:33:30.140
<v Speaker 3>We to find him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a search and we're ignoring </v>

1867
01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:32.700
<v Speaker 3>steroids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gamma rays and better rap.</v>

1868
01:33:33.910 --> 01:33:37.230
<v Speaker 3>We should read,</v>
<v Speaker 3>write and masses and reasons.</v>

1869
01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:42.840
<v Speaker 3>Again though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't take anything away from the </v>

1870
01:33:42.840 --> 01:33:43.800
<v Speaker 3>fascination of just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1871
01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:48.840
<v Speaker 3>one of the beautiful things about being </v>
<v Speaker 3>a human being is that we think about </v>

1872
01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:52.051
<v Speaker 3>these things and that we can communicate</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that you getting on this podcast </v>

1873
01:33:52.051 --> 01:33:56.911
<v Speaker 3>can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're planting all these seeds in </v>

1874
01:33:56.911 --> 01:33:58.711
<v Speaker 3>people's minds that are making them </v>
<v Speaker 3>consider these thoughts and now it </v>

1875
01:33:58.711 --> 01:33:59.210
<v Speaker 3>spreads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's.</v>

1876
01:33:59.220 --> 01:34:03.970
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the most fascInating </v>
<v Speaker 3>things about the idea of intelligence is</v>

1877
01:34:03.971 --> 01:34:08.971
<v Speaker 3>that intelligence begets intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Intelligence sort of stimulates other </v>

1878
01:34:08.971 --> 01:34:10.600
<v Speaker 3>intelligent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not simply,</v>

1879
01:34:10.710 --> 01:34:15.710
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the reasons why you love </v>

1880
01:34:15.710 --> 01:34:15.710
<v Speaker 3>educating is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1881
01:34:15.710 --> 01:34:16.210
<v Speaker 3>how important this is for you and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>want,</v>

1882
01:34:16.211 --> 01:34:21.211
<v Speaker 3>you've seen the spark and people's eyes </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you explain these things to them </v>

1883
01:34:21.211 --> 01:34:25.020
<v Speaker 3>and you realize that that person might </v>
<v Speaker 3>spread that spark somewhere else and </v>

1884
01:34:25.020 --> 01:34:26.830
<v Speaker 3>this is really what this process is </v>
<v Speaker 3>about in the first place,</v>

1885
01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:31.840
<v Speaker 3>but it has meaning to us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in the grand scheme of things,</v>

1886
01:34:32.870 --> 01:34:35.620
<v Speaker 3>we're just exporting kardashians through</v>
<v Speaker 3>the universe.</v>

1887
01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:42.240
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we could make it stop by exploiting.</v>

1888
01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:46.600
<v Speaker 3>They could see the resistance of </v>
<v Speaker 3>exploring the kardashians makes people,</v>

1889
01:34:46.780 --> 01:34:51.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the new version of cosmos with neil </v>

1890
01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:52.510
<v Speaker 3>degrasse tyson bag that gets out there </v>
<v Speaker 3>to which said,</v>

1891
01:34:52.590 --> 01:34:55.460
<v Speaker 3>that makes me optimistic actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I wouldn't have either.</v>

1892
01:34:56.310 --> 01:34:57.770
<v Speaker 3>I think it's all together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd done</v>

1893
01:34:58.220 --> 01:34:58.970
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1894
01:34:58.971 --> 01:34:59.410
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1895
01:34:59.570 --> 01:35:01.220
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to because carl sagan,</v>

1896
01:35:01.370 --> 01:35:02.590
<v Speaker 2>great hero of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1897
01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:05.990
<v Speaker 2>the fact that it would be doing them on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fox in a network,</v>

1898
01:35:06.340 --> 01:35:09.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a 13 episodes of it is.</v>

1899
01:35:09.090 --> 01:35:10.310
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

1900
01:35:10.340 --> 01:35:12.260
<v Speaker 2>There are people out there who want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

1901
01:35:13.060 --> 01:35:13.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1902
01:35:14.100 --> 01:35:19.100
<v Speaker 3>Are most certainly and more so now than </v>
<v Speaker 3>I think ever before and more so in the </v>

1903
01:35:19.100 --> 01:35:24.011
<v Speaker 3>future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think even though there is evidence </v>

1904
01:35:24.011 --> 01:35:26.471
<v Speaker 3>that people are dumb as shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's still more evidence that people </v>

1905
01:35:26.471 --> 01:35:27.520
<v Speaker 3>were super curious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's just a,</v>

1906
01:35:27.521 --> 01:35:31.430
<v Speaker 3>it's a numbers thing and if you spoon </v>
<v Speaker 3>feed people the same thing over and over</v>

1907
01:35:31.431 --> 01:35:32.600
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you know,</v>

1908
01:35:32.601 --> 01:35:34.130
<v Speaker 3>there's the argument for a limited </v>
<v Speaker 3>network,</v>

1909
01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:40.510
<v Speaker 3>especially american style or you could </v>
<v Speaker 3>just sort of do it the bbc way,</v>

1910
01:35:42.201 --> 01:35:45.710
<v Speaker 3>but the bbc way is beautiful and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of sandwiches,</v>

1911
01:35:45.711 --> 01:35:47.790
<v Speaker 3>these brilliant shows in between other </v>
<v Speaker 3>shows like,</v>

1912
01:35:48.350 --> 01:35:51.080
<v Speaker 3>but not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's not enough room.</v>

1913
01:35:51.170 --> 01:35:52.700
<v Speaker 3>There's too many things out there now </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

1914
01:35:52.730 --> 01:35:57.730
<v Speaker 3>you only have 24 hours in a day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no fucking way you're going to </v>

1915
01:35:57.730 --> 01:35:57.730
<v Speaker 3>have enough programming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just.</v>

1916
01:35:57.730 --> 01:35:59.440
<v Speaker 3>Unless you have an infinite number of </v>
<v Speaker 3>bbcs like he,</v>

1917
01:35:59.470 --> 01:36:00.470
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't.</v>

1918
01:36:00.500 --> 01:36:05.500
<v Speaker 3>There's just too much shit going on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The world is too vast and that's not </v>

1919
01:36:05.500 --> 01:36:09.161
<v Speaker 3>discounting anything that the bbc has </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever done because one of my favorite </v>

1920
01:36:09.161 --> 01:36:09.161
<v Speaker 3>networks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

1921
01:36:09.161 --> 01:36:12.500
<v Speaker 3>I have this Congo series that I've </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably watched a dozen times about the</v>

1922
01:36:12.501 --> 01:36:17.501
<v Speaker 3>bbc,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is one of the most fascinating </v>

1923
01:36:17.501 --> 01:36:19.901
<v Speaker 3>documentary documentaries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just on a particular area of the </v>

1924
01:36:19.901 --> 01:36:20.840
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but on life itself.</v>

1925
01:36:20.841 --> 01:36:25.841
<v Speaker 3>Adapting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like the primary sort of theme </v>

1926
01:36:25.841 --> 01:36:29.801
<v Speaker 3>to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to that documentary where they're </v>

1927
01:36:29.801 --> 01:36:31.571
<v Speaker 3>talking about these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these parts of the world that were </v>

1928
01:36:31.571 --> 01:36:33.920
<v Speaker 3>changed really rapidly over a period of </v>
<v Speaker 3>a couple thousand years where we used to</v>

1929
01:36:33.921 --> 01:36:38.921
<v Speaker 3>be planes and then it became these dense</v>
<v Speaker 3>rain forest and there's all these </v>

1930
01:36:38.921 --> 01:36:43.091
<v Speaker 3>animals that are sort of trapped in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>world like rhinos and plains animals.</v>

1931
01:36:43.491 --> 01:36:46.130
<v Speaker 3>And Were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was a piece on these,</v>

1932
01:36:46.140 --> 01:36:51.140
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these type of antelope color diker that </v>

1933
01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:53.210
<v Speaker 3>swims underwater a 100 yards.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can fucking swim.</v>

1934
01:36:53.330 --> 01:36:54.950
<v Speaker 3>They eat fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1935
01:36:54.951 --> 01:36:58.280
<v Speaker 3>it's craziness if swimming and swimming </v>
<v Speaker 3>as well,</v>

1936
01:36:58.281 --> 01:37:03.281
<v Speaker 3>it's related to an antelope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the idea is that you're talking </v>

1937
01:37:03.281 --> 01:37:03.890
<v Speaker 3>about a very short period of time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a couple thousand years.</v>

1938
01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:07.280
<v Speaker 3>That's had this rapid amount of change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These animals have had to adapt.</v>

1939
01:37:07.450 --> 01:37:09.470
<v Speaker 3>That is very strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>New environment.</v>

1940
01:37:10.770 --> 01:37:11.730
<v Speaker 2>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1941
01:37:11.850 --> 01:37:13.250
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1942
01:37:13.270 --> 01:37:14.160
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1943
01:37:14.330 --> 01:37:19.330
<v Speaker 2>inability of some people to understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>that evolution and therefore react </v>

1944
01:37:19.330 --> 01:37:21.630
<v Speaker 2>against it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all actually just,</v>

1945
01:37:21.940 --> 01:37:24.910
<v Speaker 2>just religiously motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of it is,</v>

1946
01:37:24.911 --> 01:37:29.911
<v Speaker 2>but some of it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's also a lack of </v>

1947
01:37:29.911 --> 01:37:31.981
<v Speaker 2>understanding of the timescales involved</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how fast animals can adapt and </v>

1948
01:37:31.981 --> 01:37:34.170
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what a powerful sieve,</v>

1949
01:37:34.250 --> 01:37:37.840
<v Speaker 2>if you like evolution is you can see it </v>
<v Speaker 2>richard dawkins often,</v>

1950
01:37:37.841 --> 01:37:40.420
<v Speaker 2>right when he's writing beautifully </v>
<v Speaker 2>about these things,</v>

1951
01:37:40.421 --> 01:37:45.320
<v Speaker 2>writes about and look at domestic dogs </v>
<v Speaker 2>and look how quickly the,</v>

1952
01:37:45.370 --> 01:37:50.370
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wolf got turned into these sort of </v>

1953
01:37:50.370 --> 01:37:51.460
<v Speaker 2>ready for poodles to german shepherds to</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever It is.</v>

1954
01:37:51.461 --> 01:37:55.590
<v Speaker 2>All those things that now that selection</v>
<v Speaker 2>by humans,</v>

1955
01:37:55.680 --> 01:37:57.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're selecting particular traits,</v>

1956
01:37:57.900 --> 01:38:02.900
<v Speaker 2>but the environment and the interaction </v>
<v Speaker 2>with other species is as powerful as </v>

1957
01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:04.470
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's as efficient as that.</v>

1958
01:38:04.500 --> 01:38:07.720
<v Speaker 2>It's the environment is a very powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>selector of,</v>

1959
01:38:07.810 --> 01:38:08.550
<v Speaker 2>of traits.</v>

1960
01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:12.330
<v Speaker 2>Then so you can see that evolution </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens quickly.</v>

1961
01:38:12.331 --> 01:38:15.750
<v Speaker 2>Speciation happens quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not quite with the dogs.</v>

1962
01:38:15.751 --> 01:38:20.751
<v Speaker 2>They still the same species,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can see how given a bit of time </v>

1963
01:38:20.751 --> 01:38:24.080
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get the poodles and keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>going on that line and get the wolves </v>

1964
01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:27.590
<v Speaker 2>and keep going on that line and </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually you're going to get things </v>

1965
01:38:27.590 --> 01:38:29.791
<v Speaker 2>that look so different that if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>separate them and don't let them into </v>

1966
01:38:29.791 --> 01:38:33.420
<v Speaker 2>breed that you're going to end up with </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that can't breed with that </v>

1967
01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:36.321
<v Speaker 2>anymore and that's kind of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>definition of a new space is one of the </v>

1968
01:38:36.321 --> 01:38:37.230
<v Speaker 2>definitions of a new species.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can see how It can happen,</v>

1969
01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:41.910
<v Speaker 2>but I think one of the problems is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>timescales are not understood.</v>

1970
01:38:41.911 --> 01:38:44.940
<v Speaker 2>When you talk about thousands of years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's quite a long time.</v>

1971
01:38:45.210 --> 01:38:46.680
<v Speaker 2>Ten thousand years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a long time,</v>

1972
01:38:47.310 --> 01:38:48.660
<v Speaker 2>200,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

1973
01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:52.200
<v Speaker 2>You go back that long and we didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>exist as a species.</v>

1974
01:38:52.380 --> 01:38:54.420
<v Speaker 2>We weren't there so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1975
01:38:54.421 --> 01:38:55.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>100,000</v>

1976
01:38:55.561 --> 01:38:58.170
<v Speaker 2>years Is a hell of a long time.</v>

1977
01:38:59.620 --> 01:39:00.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Too,</v>

1978
01:39:00.250 --> 01:39:05.250
<v Speaker 4>too long too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think in our mind to process like we </v>

1979
01:39:05.250 --> 01:39:07.330
<v Speaker 4>can kind of process a lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1980
01:39:07.331 --> 01:39:10.960
<v Speaker 4>we can process birth to a hundred years </v>
<v Speaker 4>while he lived to be 100.</v>

1981
01:39:11.200 --> 01:39:12.070
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of what?</v>

1982
01:39:12.071 --> 01:39:16.810
<v Speaker 4>A lot of things that guy must've seen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But to process 100 of those.</v>

1983
01:39:17.170 --> 01:39:19.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>100 hundreds.</v>

1984
01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:22.330
<v Speaker 4>How about a thousand?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How about 100,000?</v>

1985
01:39:22.480 --> 01:39:23.420
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1986
01:39:23.480 --> 01:39:25.120
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just too much going on.</v>

1987
01:39:25.121 --> 01:39:26.890
<v Speaker 4>There's too much change that a long </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1988
01:39:26.950 --> 01:39:31.950
<v Speaker 4>Do you subscribe to the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I've heard this debated about that </v>

1989
01:39:31.950 --> 01:39:35.491
<v Speaker 4>human intelligence may be in some form </v>
<v Speaker 4>exponential and that all the knowledge </v>

1990
01:39:36.580 --> 01:39:41.580
<v Speaker 4>that people have acquIred mean obviously</v>
<v Speaker 4>not like in a physical sense like </v>

1991
01:39:41.580 --> 01:39:41.610
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

1992
01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:43.390
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not born with an understanding of</v>

1993
01:39:43.391 --> 01:39:46.240
<v Speaker 4>math and language and all these things </v>
<v Speaker 4>are learned,</v>

1994
01:39:46.270 --> 01:39:51.270
<v Speaker 4>but that intelligence may somehow </v>
<v Speaker 4>another be not just passed on from </v>

1995
01:39:52.091 --> 01:39:57.091
<v Speaker 4>generation to generation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but enhanced by life's experiences and </v>

1996
01:39:57.091 --> 01:40:00.550
<v Speaker 4>that the genes that are transmitted from</v>
<v Speaker 4>you to your children may be in fact more</v>

1997
01:40:00.551 --> 01:40:05.551
<v Speaker 4>powerful than the genes you were given </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that as you've lived your life and </v>

1998
01:40:05.551 --> 01:40:08.410
<v Speaker 4>acquired information and knowledge and </v>
<v Speaker 4>understanding and whatever,</v>

1999
01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:10.630
<v Speaker 4>whatever intelligence means,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2000
01:40:10.650 --> 01:40:15.370
<v Speaker 4>whatever sort of intangible idea </v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligence truly is,</v>

2001
01:40:15.550 --> 01:40:17.620
<v Speaker 4>but that this mind power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

2002
01:40:17.621 --> 01:40:21.070
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this accumulation over the 200,000</v>

2003
01:40:21.071 --> 01:40:26.071
<v Speaker 4>years that human beings have existed and</v>
<v Speaker 4>people breeding and getting to this </v>

2004
01:40:26.071 --> 01:40:27.820
<v Speaker 4>point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that this might exponentially be growing</v>

2005
01:40:27.821 --> 01:40:28.570
<v Speaker 4>and expanding.</v>

2006
01:40:28.570 --> 01:40:31.030
<v Speaker 4>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that in any way possible that we're,</v>

2007
01:40:31.290 --> 01:40:31.530
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2008
01:40:32.010 --> 01:40:35.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm not an expert on genetics?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

2009
01:40:35.820 --> 01:40:40.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's any evidence as </v>
<v Speaker 2>far as I know that our iq average iq to </v>

2010
01:40:42.331 --> 01:40:45.960
<v Speaker 2>change much over the last few hundred </v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

2011
01:40:45.961 --> 01:40:47.090
<v Speaker 2>certainly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2012
01:40:47.490 --> 01:40:48.990
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as far as I know,</v>

2013
01:40:48.991 --> 01:40:53.160
<v Speaker 2>that's not the way that it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the you need,</v>

2014
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:59.010
<v Speaker 2>I think some kind of selector that would</v>
<v Speaker 2>say you'd have to take the most </v>

2015
01:41:00.070 --> 01:41:03.520
<v Speaker 2>intelligent levels by some measure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say.</v>

2016
01:41:03.970 --> 01:41:08.970
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and have them be more successful at </v>

2017
01:41:08.970 --> 01:41:10.960
<v Speaker 2>producing offspring than the people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are less intelligent.</v>

2018
01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:11.530
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to do,</v>

2019
01:41:11.710 --> 01:41:13.140
<v Speaker 4>but isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need some mechanism.</v>

2020
01:41:13.580 --> 01:41:18.580
<v Speaker 4>Why haven't they done like those do the </v>
<v Speaker 4>sperm banks were really super </v>

2021
01:41:18.580 --> 01:41:20.770
<v Speaker 4>intelligent people and like the kids </v>
<v Speaker 4>that come out of it or smartest shit.</v>

2022
01:41:21.640 --> 01:41:24.400
<v Speaker 2>Oh well that I could imagine that might </v>
<v Speaker 2>be true.</v>

2023
01:41:25.630 --> 01:41:27.420
<v Speaker 2>I think the correct answer </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientifically,</v>

2024
01:41:27.430 --> 01:41:32.430
<v Speaker 2>if you don't know the link between,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know enough about the genetics </v>

2025
01:41:32.430 --> 01:41:35.521
<v Speaker 2>and the genome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the human genome to say which bits are </v>

2026
01:41:35.521 --> 01:41:36.350
<v Speaker 2>producing brain power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If research they.</v>

2027
01:41:36.370 --> 01:41:38.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is it that you know,</v>

2028
01:41:38.051 --> 01:41:43.051
<v Speaker 2>which genes are really intelligent gene </v>
<v Speaker 2>or set of genes and I think that that's </v>

2029
01:41:43.061 --> 01:41:44.980
<v Speaker 2>not known I think is the right thing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

2030
01:41:45.070 --> 01:41:50.070
<v Speaker 2>but I emphasize it's not my field,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it must have something to ponder.</v>

2031
01:41:50.111 --> 01:41:55.111
<v Speaker 2>When you think about evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think about genetic knowledge and </v>

2032
01:41:55.111 --> 01:41:58.261
<v Speaker 2>that the like certain things that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would perhaps argue with that the idea </v>

2033
01:41:58.261 --> 01:42:02.050
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know there's some interest in this,</v>

2034
01:42:02.051 --> 01:42:04.150
<v Speaker 2>but I think that the standard answer is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>

2035
01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:07.890
<v Speaker 2>the knowledge let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I become educated that,</v>

2036
01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:13.000
<v Speaker 2>that I think the standard answer is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would not have any impact on the </v>

2037
01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:17.131
<v Speaker 2>jeans that I passed to my offspring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's any known </v>

2038
01:42:17.131 --> 01:42:19.140
<v Speaker 2>mechanism to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have knowledge in imprinted,</v>

2039
01:42:19.170 --> 01:42:22.630
<v Speaker 2>so back into your genetic code such that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can be sent onto your thing,</v>

2040
01:42:22.810 --> 01:42:25.900
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you may have seen otherwise.</v>

2041
01:42:26.250 --> 01:42:28.720
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not aware of any research.</v>

2042
01:42:28.880 --> 01:42:33.880
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to like look into a kid's head</v>
<v Speaker 2>and find out exactly where all the </v>

2043
01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:33.880
<v Speaker 2>information is coming from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2044
01:42:33.880 --> 01:42:35.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think there's a known.</v>

2045
01:42:35.590 --> 01:42:40.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there isn't a known a known.</v>

2046
01:42:40.290 --> 01:42:41.240
<v Speaker 2>Was that just something we have to</v>

2047
01:42:41.340 --> 01:42:46.340
<v Speaker 4>tri caster just freeze up on us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People at home right now are freaking </v>

2048
01:42:46.340 --> 01:42:49.561
<v Speaker 4>the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were just about to get to the bottom </v>

2049
01:42:49.561 --> 01:42:51.691
<v Speaker 4>of this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm instincts like humans have certain </v>

2050
01:42:51.691 --> 01:42:51.691
<v Speaker 4>instincts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2051
01:42:51.691 --> 01:42:55.210
<v Speaker 4>Like there's people have fears like </v>
<v Speaker 4>genetically sort of predisposed fears to</v>

2052
01:42:55.211 --> 01:42:57.310
<v Speaker 4>like scary dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>animals.</v>

2053
01:42:57.340 --> 01:43:02.340
<v Speaker 4>I mean we know you don't have to have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>dog bite you to know the dogs fucking </v>

2054
01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:05.581
<v Speaker 4>terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what is that like when a dog is </v>

2055
01:43:05.581 --> 01:43:05.740
<v Speaker 4>growling?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like kids are afraid of teeth,</v>

2056
01:43:05.890 --> 01:43:07.540
<v Speaker 4>they're afraid of big teeth and </v>
<v Speaker 4>monsters.</v>

2057
01:43:07.541 --> 01:43:09.190
<v Speaker 4>Like even children that grow up in </v>
<v Speaker 4>cities,</v>

2058
01:43:09.340 --> 01:43:14.340
<v Speaker 4>they're afraid of monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the idea behind that that I've </v>

2059
01:43:14.340 --> 01:43:14.350
<v Speaker 4>heard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was rupert sheldrake there,</v>

2060
01:43:14.351 --> 01:43:19.351
<v Speaker 4>was talking about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was saying that it may very well be </v>

2061
01:43:19.351 --> 01:43:23.401
<v Speaker 4>that these memories of being preyed upon</v>
<v Speaker 4>by like cats like that.</v>

2062
01:43:25.481 --> 01:43:28.480
<v Speaker 4>These genetic memories that are from our</v>
<v Speaker 4>ancient,</v>

2063
01:43:28.481 --> 01:43:29.800
<v Speaker 4>ancient,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ancient ancestors.</v>

2064
01:43:29.801 --> 01:43:32.430
<v Speaker 4>When we didn't have homes and we were </v>
<v Speaker 4>living in trees and we were.</v>

2065
01:43:32.830 --> 01:43:37.830
<v Speaker 4>Things were running after us trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>eat us and these ideas are passed down </v>

2066
01:43:37.830 --> 01:43:40.390
<v Speaker 4>from animal to animal and eventually </v>
<v Speaker 4>human to human.</v>

2067
01:43:40.610 --> 01:43:45.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's as far as I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no solid evidence that suggests </v>

2068
01:43:45.981 --> 01:43:49.040
<v Speaker 2>that things you experience as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a,</v>

2069
01:43:49.520 --> 01:43:54.520
<v Speaker 2>as an adult or child,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the experiences themselves can be can be</v>

2070
01:43:54.651 --> 01:43:59.651
<v Speaker 2>passed on the other than the verbally to</v>
<v Speaker 2>them when they're listening to your </v>

2071
01:43:59.651 --> 01:44:02.891
<v Speaker 2>stories that I'm not aware of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any mechanism that's known that would </v>

2072
01:44:02.891 --> 01:44:02.950
<v Speaker 2>allow that to happen,</v>

2073
01:44:02.990 --> 01:44:07.990
<v Speaker 4>haven't they've proven that genetics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>epigenetics and the in some some memes </v>

2074
01:44:08.451 --> 01:44:12.590
<v Speaker 4>like even useless ones like racism can </v>
<v Speaker 4>be transmitted from parent to child.</v>

2075
01:44:12.950 --> 01:44:15.260
<v Speaker 4>Not that I'm aware of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know.</v>

2076
01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:19.030
<v Speaker 4>Obviously not my field of study either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>just a.</v>

2077
01:44:19.031 --> 01:44:23.570
<v Speaker 4>I'm just fascinated by the idea that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't totally understand all of the.</v>

2078
01:44:24.620 --> 01:44:28.490
<v Speaker 4>All the ingredients of the mind and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's certainly true.</v>

2079
01:44:28.610 --> 01:44:31.040
<v Speaker 4>That's certainly true,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not aware of.</v>

2080
01:44:31.180 --> 01:44:36.180
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I doubt it because I can't see a </v>

2081
01:44:36.180 --> 01:44:37.310
<v Speaker 4>mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brown butter?</v>

2082
01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:38.310
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are we back up,</v>

2083
01:44:38.311 --> 01:44:40.160
<v Speaker 4>jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's going on?</v>

2084
01:44:40.220 --> 01:44:42.430
<v Speaker 4>Tri caster froze.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2085
01:44:42.490 --> 01:44:44.420
<v Speaker 4>what a piece of shit that we paid </v>
<v Speaker 4>$15,000</v>

2086
01:44:44.421 --> 01:44:46.670
<v Speaker 4>for.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How dare you try castor people?</v>

2087
01:44:47.090 --> 01:44:52.090
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we should probably be excited that </v>

2088
01:44:52.090 --> 01:44:54.401
<v Speaker 4>someone figured that fucking thing out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You think it might have to do with the </v>

2089
01:44:54.401 --> 01:44:54.740
<v Speaker 4>box and it gets heated up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have no idea.</v>

2090
01:44:54.860 --> 01:44:56.740
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just shit out on us.</v>

2091
01:44:57.910 --> 01:44:59.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>most likely,</v>

2092
01:44:59.601 --> 01:45:00.650
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How dare they?</v>

2093
01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:07.240
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that was proposed that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I read recently was that black holes </v>

2094
01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:07.850
<v Speaker 4>aren't real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that nonsense?</v>

2095
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:10.280
<v Speaker 4>Is that like one person's controversial </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea?</v>

2096
01:45:11.330 --> 01:45:11.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2097
01:45:12.180 --> 01:45:12.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically,</v>

2098
01:45:12.931 --> 01:45:15.900
<v Speaker 2>it's not necessarily nonsense just </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's one person's idea,</v>

2099
01:45:15.901 --> 01:45:20.901
<v Speaker 2>but it's likely to be nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen that particular theory,</v>

2100
01:45:21.211 --> 01:45:22.480
<v Speaker 2>so I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the.</v>

2101
01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:26.250
<v Speaker 2>We have a lot of good evidence for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>existence of black holes.</v>

2102
01:45:26.270 --> 01:45:31.270
<v Speaker 2>Not least theY predicted there </v>
<v Speaker 2>prediction of einstein's theory of </v>

2103
01:45:31.270 --> 01:45:34.971
<v Speaker 2>general relativity and they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're on solid theoretical ground and </v>

2104
01:45:34.971 --> 01:45:37.380
<v Speaker 2>we've seen the signatures of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>

2105
01:45:37.710 --> 01:45:40.020
<v Speaker 2>the object at the center of the milky </v>
<v Speaker 2>way galaxy,</v>

2106
01:45:40.770 --> 01:45:45.770
<v Speaker 2>we know what the masses of that object,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we've measured the orbits of </v>

2107
01:45:45.770 --> 01:45:49.281
<v Speaker 2>stars very close to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We know what the maximum size of the </v>

2108
01:45:49.281 --> 01:45:52.941
<v Speaker 2>object can be because it can be bigger </v>
<v Speaker 2>than the orbits of the styles that go </v>

2109
01:45:52.941 --> 01:45:53.600
<v Speaker 2>around it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so we measure its mass.</v>

2110
01:45:53.620 --> 01:45:58.620
<v Speaker 2>I think it's about 4 million times the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mass of the sun and the only way that </v>

2111
01:45:58.620 --> 01:46:02.070
<v Speaker 2>our current laws of physics allow such </v>
<v Speaker 2>an object to exist and be so small is </v>

2112
01:46:02.070 --> 01:46:06.320
<v Speaker 2>for it to be a black hole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's good evidence that black </v>

2113
01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:06.840
<v Speaker 2>holes are around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can always say,</v>

2114
01:46:06.841 --> 01:46:07.410
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2115
01:46:07.411 --> 01:46:12.411
<v Speaker 2>we've never been to one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're very hard to photograph because </v>

2116
01:46:12.411 --> 01:46:12.411
<v Speaker 2>they're black,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can,</v>

2117
01:46:12.411 --> 01:46:14.190
<v Speaker 2>but you can photograph the stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 2>falls into them.</v>

2118
01:46:14.191 --> 01:46:16.530
<v Speaker 2>You can see the signature of stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>fallen into them,</v>

2119
01:46:17.040 --> 01:46:17.670
<v Speaker 2>which we do</v>

2120
01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:20.010
<v Speaker 4>and they've,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they've.</v>

2121
01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:23.100
<v Speaker 4>What was it like?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was somewhere in the two thousands.</v>

2122
01:46:23.130 --> 01:46:28.130
<v Speaker 4>They figured out that at the center of </v>
<v Speaker 4>every galaxies of supermassive black </v>

2123
01:46:28.130 --> 01:46:29.370
<v Speaker 4>hole that is like one half of one </v>
<v Speaker 4>percent of the mass,</v>

2124
01:46:29.371 --> 01:46:30.780
<v Speaker 4>the galaxy or something along those </v>
<v Speaker 4>lines.</v>

2125
01:46:30.781 --> 01:46:30.990
<v Speaker 4>We</v>

2126
01:46:30.990 --> 01:46:31.990
<v Speaker 2>think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As I said,</v>

2127
01:46:31.991 --> 01:46:36.991
<v Speaker 2>I think off the top of my head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's about 4 million times the </v>

2128
01:46:36.991 --> 01:46:39.771
<v Speaker 2>mass of the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the larger galaxies would have a </v>

2129
01:46:39.771 --> 01:46:39.771
<v Speaker 2>larger black hole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure if it's that.</v>

2130
01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:45.200
<v Speaker 2>It's not well understood actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's not well understood how </v>

2131
01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:48.411
<v Speaker 2>galaxies form in the first place and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what role the supermassive black holes </v>

2132
01:46:48.451 --> 01:46:53.451
<v Speaker 2>having the formation of the galaxies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's a real active area of </v>

2133
01:46:53.451 --> 01:46:54.990
<v Speaker 2>research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually a good question.</v>

2134
01:46:55.040 --> 01:47:00.040
<v Speaker 4>The thing that I was reading was there </v>
<v Speaker 4>were debating the possibility that </v>

2135
01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:01.240
<v Speaker 4>inside each one of these supermassive </v>
<v Speaker 4>black holes,</v>

2136
01:47:01.241 --> 01:47:03.980
<v Speaker 4>so like there being hundreds of billions</v>
<v Speaker 4>of galaxies,</v>

2137
01:47:03.981 --> 01:47:06.650
<v Speaker 4>each one of them with a black hole in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the center of it,</v>

2138
01:47:06.651 --> 01:47:11.651
<v Speaker 4>a supermassive black hole in through </v>
<v Speaker 4>that black hole is a whole nother </v>

2139
01:47:11.651 --> 01:47:13.040
<v Speaker 4>universe with hundreds of billions of </v>
<v Speaker 4>galaxies.</v>

2140
01:47:13.041 --> 01:47:18.041
<v Speaker 4>Each with black holes go through that </v>
<v Speaker 4>whole hundred billion more galaxies.</v>

2141
01:47:18.950 --> 01:47:21.110
<v Speaker 4>Each with black holes go through that </v>
<v Speaker 4>hundred dollars,</v>

2142
01:47:21.111 --> 01:47:22.140
<v Speaker 4>billion more that</v>

2143
01:47:22.170 --> 01:47:26.940
<v Speaker 2>each galaxy itself literally as a portal</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a completely different universe.</v>

2144
01:47:26.941 --> 01:47:31.941
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we don't have a problem with </v>

2145
01:47:31.941 --> 01:47:36.770
<v Speaker 2>black holes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that their prediction of einstein's </v>

2146
01:47:36.770 --> 01:47:37.870
<v Speaker 2>theory?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the earliest predictions,</v>

2147
01:47:37.871 --> 01:47:40.470
<v Speaker 2>there's a thing called the swatch child </v>
<v Speaker 2>metric,</v>

2148
01:47:40.530 --> 01:47:44.360
<v Speaker 2>which describes black holes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was done I think in 1915 or 16 years,</v>

2149
01:47:44.370 --> 01:47:49.370
<v Speaker 2>right as soon as relativity was </v>
<v Speaker 2>published is when they're showing that </v>

2150
01:47:49.370 --> 01:47:50.700
<v Speaker 2>these things could exist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2151
01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:52.710
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't.</v>

2152
01:47:52.900 --> 01:47:57.690
<v Speaker 2>The theory itself Breaks down and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>the theory of black holes,</v>

2153
01:47:57.940 --> 01:48:02.940
<v Speaker 2>the general relativity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the theory that explained </v>

2154
01:48:02.940 --> 01:48:02.940
<v Speaker 2>einstein's theory rejects so predicts </v>
<v Speaker 2>their existence,</v>

2155
01:48:02.940 --> 01:48:05.850
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The characteristics of black holes,</v>

2156
01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:08.790
<v Speaker 2>the physics inside black holes is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>understood.</v>

2157
01:48:08.990 --> 01:48:10.920
<v Speaker 2>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our theories don't work.</v>

2158
01:48:11.070 --> 01:48:15.210
<v Speaker 2>We need what's called a quantum theory </v>
<v Speaker 2>of gravity to make progress there.</v>

2159
01:48:15.390 --> 01:48:20.390
<v Speaker 2>So that's the unification of quantum </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory and relativity and general </v>

2160
01:48:20.390 --> 01:48:24.171
<v Speaker 2>relativity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is what string theory is an </v>

2161
01:48:24.171 --> 01:48:26.571
<v Speaker 2>attempt to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't know whether that's the </v>

2162
01:48:26.571 --> 01:48:26.571
<v Speaker 2>right theory.</v>

2163
01:48:26.571 --> 01:48:26.571
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2164
01:48:26.571 --> 01:48:26.571
<v Speaker 2>so we will see this is the edge of </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge.</v>

2165
01:48:26.571 --> 01:48:31.520
<v Speaker 2>So we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know what we don't know how to </v>

2166
01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:32.610
<v Speaker 2>describe black holes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably we have a theory that's capable</v>

2167
01:48:32.611 --> 01:48:37.611
<v Speaker 2>of describing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can describe the edge of this thing </v>

2168
01:48:37.611 --> 01:48:37.740
<v Speaker 2>about an event horizon and all that </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff that works.</v>

2169
01:48:37.860 --> 01:48:39.840
<v Speaker 2>That's not a problem in einstein's </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory,</v>

2170
01:48:40.170 --> 01:48:43.230
<v Speaker 2>so the idea that if you have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sufficiently den subject,</v>

2171
01:48:43.740 --> 01:48:48.740
<v Speaker 2>then there's a region around it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm out of which light contest scape </v>

2172
01:48:48.870 --> 01:48:51.720
<v Speaker 2>because space and time are to curb for </v>
<v Speaker 2>light to get out.</v>

2173
01:48:51.960 --> 01:48:53.010
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

2174
01:48:53.011 --> 01:48:56.100
<v Speaker 2>The theory describes that properly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you go,</v>

2175
01:48:56.130 --> 01:49:01.130
<v Speaker 2>when you start asking questions about </v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens at the center of a black </v>

2176
01:49:01.130 --> 01:49:01.130
<v Speaker 2>hole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a singularity,</v>

2177
01:49:01.130 --> 01:49:04.970
<v Speaker 2>that very idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called a singularity tells you </v>

2178
01:49:04.970 --> 01:49:05.730
<v Speaker 2>their infinities in the theory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The theory is doing things is infinitely</v>

2179
01:49:05.731 --> 01:49:07.050
<v Speaker 2>dentist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's infinitely small.</v>

2180
01:49:07.050 --> 01:49:07.890
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2181
01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:09.420
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it won't be it.</v>

2182
01:49:09.850 --> 01:49:14.850
<v Speaker 2>We don't have infinities in general in </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature other than perhaps the size of </v>

2183
01:49:14.850 --> 01:49:15.500
<v Speaker 2>the university as you say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so,</v>

2184
01:49:15.550 --> 01:49:16.000
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2185
01:49:16.170 --> 01:49:19.950
<v Speaker 2>so there's something going on there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we don't have the physical theory.</v>

2186
01:49:19.951 --> 01:49:24.090
<v Speaker 2>We don't have the tools to describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an active area of research.</v>

2187
01:49:24.300 --> 01:49:26.520
<v Speaker 2>So I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a good answer in science.</v>

2188
01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:29.010
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so speculations fun,</v>

2189
01:49:29.340 --> 01:49:30.450
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but ultimately,</v>

2190
01:49:30.451 --> 01:49:31.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about,</v>

2191
01:49:31.980 --> 01:49:34.870
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about a regime of nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2192
01:49:35.040 --> 01:49:35.880
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>

2193
01:49:36.180 --> 01:49:41.180
<v Speaker 2>which are current theories and not </v>
<v Speaker 2>capable of describing with any </v>

2194
01:49:41.180 --> 01:49:41.180
<v Speaker 2>authority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

2195
01:49:41.180 --> 01:49:45.381
<v Speaker 2>that's the inside of a black hole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about this before the </v>

2196
01:49:45.381 --> 01:49:48.951
<v Speaker 2>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the difference between the way you </v>

2197
01:49:48.951 --> 01:49:51.531
<v Speaker 2>present your shows and the bbc and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way you're sort of forced to present </v>

2198
01:49:51.531 --> 01:49:56.101
<v Speaker 2>your shows on the science channel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this was one of the very issues as a</v>

2199
01:49:56.750 --> 01:50:01.420
<v Speaker 2>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's dealing with unknowns,</v>

2200
01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:06.480
<v Speaker 2>dealing with what you're describing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things like black holes or like the </v>

2201
01:50:06.821 --> 01:50:11.821
<v Speaker 2>event horizon of a black hole that there</v>
<v Speaker 2>are points in time where you have to say</v>

2202
01:50:12.490 --> 01:50:13.300
<v Speaker 2>we don't know yet.</v>

2203
01:50:13.540 --> 01:50:18.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That we were talking earlier and I said </v>

2204
01:50:18.540 --> 01:50:19.750
<v Speaker 2>because at the moment we're a cyber </v>
<v Speaker 2>series in the uk called human universe,</v>

2205
01:50:19.751 --> 01:50:21.710
<v Speaker 2>which has been on in the uk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2206
01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:26.910
<v Speaker 2>five episodes one hour long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we also make them with science </v>

2207
01:50:26.910 --> 01:50:30.661
<v Speaker 2>channel and besides channels one hour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's 43 minutes because they have </v>

2208
01:50:30.661 --> 01:50:30.661
<v Speaker 2>adverts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2209
01:50:30.661 --> 01:50:31.930
<v Speaker 2>Commercials.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So fine,</v>

2210
01:50:31.990 --> 01:50:34.530
<v Speaker 2>that's the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we've got to take 17 minutes out.</v>

2211
01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:39.530
<v Speaker 2>But also we have some interaction about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well how do we nuance things for the.</v>

2212
01:50:40.150 --> 01:50:45.150
<v Speaker 2>Because you'll do things for a british </v>
<v Speaker 2>market that will be different in </v>

2213
01:50:45.150 --> 01:50:48.340
<v Speaker 2>american market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of my favorites recently was </v>

2214
01:50:48.340 --> 01:50:50.881
<v Speaker 2>that one of the programs is about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>multiverse that we just talked about </v>

2215
01:50:50.881 --> 01:50:54.391
<v Speaker 2>earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that may be an infinite number </v>

2216
01:50:54.391 --> 01:50:56.251
<v Speaker 2>of universes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The universe may have been around </v>

2217
01:50:56.251 --> 01:50:58.291
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There may be no beginning to the </v>

2218
01:50:58.291 --> 01:50:58.291
<v Speaker 2>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all speculative,</v>

2219
01:50:58.291 --> 01:50:58.291
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2220
01:50:58.291 --> 01:50:58.900
<v Speaker 2>Then they have it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what does that mean?</v>

2221
01:50:58.901 --> 01:51:01.090
<v Speaker 2>It means that our existence is </v>
<v Speaker 2>inevitable.</v>

2222
01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:06.360
<v Speaker 2>We have to exist in an infinite universe</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we are because we have to be.</v>

2223
01:51:07.030 --> 01:51:12.030
<v Speaker 2>So there's no purpose to our existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no universal meaning to our </v>

2224
01:51:12.131 --> 01:51:13.240
<v Speaker 2>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are,</v>

2225
01:51:13.241 --> 01:51:16.030
<v Speaker 2>because we have to be an in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the british virgin,</v>

2226
01:51:16.031 --> 01:51:17.320
<v Speaker 2>I say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to the camera.</v>

2227
01:51:17.321 --> 01:51:22.321
<v Speaker 2>How does that make you feel?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the wonderful thing is nobody knows </v>

2228
01:51:22.321 --> 01:51:23.020
<v Speaker 2>this is new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Physics is right at the edge.</v>

2229
01:51:23.021 --> 01:51:28.021
<v Speaker 2>It's speculative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're beginning to address it with </v>

2230
01:51:28.021 --> 01:51:31.621
<v Speaker 2>the data and the theories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we need theologians and philosophers </v>

2231
01:51:31.621 --> 01:51:32.970
<v Speaker 2>and artists and novelists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to discuss these things.</v>

2232
01:51:33.160 --> 01:51:38.160
<v Speaker 2>What does it mean for us?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we're at our existence is inevitable </v>

2233
01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:39.730
<v Speaker 2>and we're not special,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet we may still be valuable.</v>

2234
01:51:39.920 --> 01:51:44.920
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the last thing I say in a british </v>

2235
01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:47.911
<v Speaker 2>version is so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what do you think say to the </v>

2236
01:51:47.911 --> 01:51:50.041
<v Speaker 2>audience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think it's beautiful and it's </v>

2237
01:51:50.041 --> 01:51:50.041
<v Speaker 2>filmed over tokyo over tokyo skylight I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think is beautiful.</v>

2238
01:51:50.380 --> 01:51:52.510
<v Speaker 2>But I did get a note from the science </v>
<v Speaker 2>channel saying,</v>

2239
01:51:52.810 --> 01:51:55.600
<v Speaker 2>well the thing is that this is not the </v>
<v Speaker 2>style on the.</v>

2240
01:51:55.720 --> 01:51:57.670
<v Speaker 2>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we tend to try and leave the viewer with</v>

2241
01:51:57.671 --> 01:51:58.720
<v Speaker 2>some concrete things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

2242
01:51:59.050 --> 01:52:04.050
<v Speaker 2>So can you tell them what it means for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the song and what the meaning of life,</v>

2243
01:52:05.770 --> 01:52:10.770
<v Speaker 2>the meaning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the great existential question of what </v>

2244
01:52:10.770 --> 01:52:11.320
<v Speaker 2>does it mean to exist?</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want me to answer that?</v>

2245
01:52:12.060 --> 01:52:13.030
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'd be better for,</v>

2246
01:52:13.090 --> 01:52:14.710
<v Speaker 2>for our audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

2247
01:52:14.711 --> 01:52:18.820
<v Speaker 2>well I really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a bit.</v>

2248
01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:21.030
<v Speaker 2>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2249
01:52:21.090 --> 01:52:22.690
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you tell me what to say?</v>

2250
01:52:22.720 --> 01:52:25.720
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps I'd love it if.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look if science channel,</v>

2251
01:52:26.140 --> 01:52:31.140
<v Speaker 2>if you know the meaning of life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then we tell me and I'll gladly say on </v>

2252
01:52:31.331 --> 01:52:32.080
<v Speaker 2>the blog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2253
01:52:32.420 --> 01:52:35.650
<v Speaker 2>So it was kind of interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's that difference in style,</v>

2254
01:52:35.800 --> 01:52:37.320
<v Speaker 2>but I loved it that they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can we do.</v>

2255
01:52:37.370 --> 01:52:40.100
<v Speaker 2>We really do want you to broadcast the </v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning of life undiscovered.</v>

2256
01:52:40.290 --> 01:52:45.290
<v Speaker 2>Nine o'clock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I can see how it'd be great </v>

2257
01:52:45.290 --> 01:52:45.290
<v Speaker 2>sell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2258
01:52:45.290 --> 01:52:45.440
<v Speaker 2>undiscovered tonight after sharks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2259
01:52:45.441 --> 01:52:50.441
<v Speaker 2>whatever they put on extra shot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were going to do the meaning of life </v>

2260
01:52:50.441 --> 01:52:53.570
<v Speaker 2>with professor Brian Cox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian cox will tell you what it means to</v>

2261
01:52:53.571 --> 01:52:58.571
<v Speaker 2>exist for your existence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be inevitable in a possibly infinite </v>

2262
01:52:58.571 --> 01:52:59.600
<v Speaker 2>cosmos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Find out at nine I either.</v>

2263
01:52:59.710 --> 01:53:02.750
<v Speaker 2>So it would be good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't be completely subjective.</v>

2264
01:53:03.300 --> 01:53:07.700
<v Speaker 2>What life means to you doesn't you know </v>
<v Speaker 2>jamie as a differences that need.</v>

2265
01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:10.100
<v Speaker 2>This is what we do do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do do in the series I.</v>

2266
01:53:10.110 --> 01:53:13.520
<v Speaker 2>This is what it's about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a love letter to the human race,</v>

2267
01:53:13.521 --> 01:53:14.750
<v Speaker 2>human universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>

2268
01:53:15.170 --> 01:53:20.170
<v Speaker 2>You see that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certainly if you buy the one hour </v>

2269
01:53:20.170 --> 01:53:22.961
<v Speaker 2>version,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how it's gonna pan out in </v>

2270
01:53:22.961 --> 01:53:22.961
<v Speaker 2>43,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you,</v>

2271
01:53:22.961 --> 01:53:23.720
<v Speaker 2>if you get the one which you can buy </v>
<v Speaker 2>from good retailers on the internet,</v>

2272
01:53:24.480 --> 01:53:25.910
<v Speaker 2>it turns Out you need a.</v>

2273
01:53:26.590 --> 01:53:29.210
<v Speaker 2>It's not an itunes at the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you need it.</v>

2274
01:53:29.211 --> 01:53:34.070
<v Speaker 2>You need a 10 ati blu ray player.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will say you do that,</v>

2275
01:53:34.071 --> 01:53:36.230
<v Speaker 2>not all us dvd players play 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eight year.</v>

2276
01:53:36.231 --> 01:53:39.300
<v Speaker 2>I content your plates and aup content,</v>
<v Speaker 2>technical stuff.</v>

2277
01:53:39.730 --> 01:53:42.170
<v Speaker 2>One of them is called interlaced and one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of them is called progressive scan.</v>

2278
01:53:42.171 --> 01:53:44.590
<v Speaker 2>There's virtually no difference except </v>
<v Speaker 2>that in europe we tend to.</v>

2279
01:53:44.750 --> 01:53:49.750
<v Speaker 2>So some of your blue ray players in </v>
<v Speaker 2>America will play it and some of them </v>

2280
01:53:49.750 --> 01:53:50.770
<v Speaker 2>won't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It turns out I just found out they,</v>

2281
01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:54.050
<v Speaker 2>it's the one that the under blue ray,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can buy it.</v>

2282
01:53:54.470 --> 01:53:59.470
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I encourage you to because it's </v>

2283
01:53:59.470 --> 01:53:59.470
<v Speaker 2>wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

2284
01:53:59.470 --> 01:53:59.470
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2285
01:53:59.470 --> 01:54:00.230
<v Speaker 2>but so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's something so,</v>

2286
01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:02.150
<v Speaker 2>but it'll be unsigned channel anyway in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a few months,</v>

2287
01:54:02.151 --> 01:54:04.150
<v Speaker 2>but it will cut down a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

2288
01:54:04.180 --> 01:54:07.370
<v Speaker 2>but the central message is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it we talked about earlier,</v>

2289
01:54:07.371 --> 01:54:07.730
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2290
01:54:08.060 --> 01:54:10.220
<v Speaker 2>it leads you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think to value the human race.</v>

2291
01:54:10.340 --> 01:54:12.440
<v Speaker 2>So there's like we filmed in Ethiopia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I love.</v>

2292
01:54:12.441 --> 01:54:17.441
<v Speaker 2>I always love filling in Ethiopia </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we were in the rift valley </v>

2293
01:54:17.441 --> 01:54:18.050
<v Speaker 2>filming this story about the emergence </v>
<v Speaker 2>of humans from the rift valley.</v>

2294
01:54:18.650 --> 01:54:21.710
<v Speaker 2>And then we filmed in some I call the </v>
<v Speaker 2>danica depression,</v>

2295
01:54:21.740 --> 01:54:24.130
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other than death valley,</v>

2296
01:54:24.131 --> 01:54:26.600
<v Speaker 2>you advise with death valley often for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hottest place on earth,</v>

2297
01:54:26.870 --> 01:54:29.500
<v Speaker 2>but it's far more barren and death </v>
<v Speaker 2>valley.</v>

2298
01:54:29.501 --> 01:54:34.501
<v Speaker 2>So if in northern Ethiopia on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>eritrean border there are volcanoes and </v>

2299
01:54:34.501 --> 01:54:38.531
<v Speaker 2>it's bleak and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a tribe of people call the </v>

2300
01:54:38.531 --> 01:54:41.321
<v Speaker 2>fr that lived there and they fascinating</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I stayed with them a few years ago </v>

2301
01:54:41.321 --> 01:54:42.680
<v Speaker 2>and they don't have a concept for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

2302
01:54:42.681 --> 01:54:45.260
<v Speaker 2>of possessions because they don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

2303
01:54:45.290 --> 01:54:48.350
<v Speaker 2>They just live on these volcanoes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this wasteland.</v>

2304
01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:53.600
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they say if you put something down </v>

2305
01:54:53.600 --> 01:54:55.810
<v Speaker 2>like a something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they will legitimately pick it up </v>

2306
01:54:55.810 --> 01:54:55.810
<v Speaker 2>and they'll.</v>

2307
01:54:55.810 --> 01:54:57.470
<v Speaker 2>And they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'm going to use it for a while.</v>

2308
01:54:57.710 --> 01:55:01.640
<v Speaker 2>So when your film crew you kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no cultural idea.</v>

2309
01:55:01.650 --> 01:55:03.680
<v Speaker 2>They're not stealing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not taking stuff.</v>

2310
01:55:03.780 --> 01:55:06.140
<v Speaker 2>They don't have that idea because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't have anything.</v>

2311
01:55:06.410 --> 01:55:08.930
<v Speaker 2>So they leave the camera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they might get your camera.</v>

2312
01:55:09.070 --> 01:55:11.280
<v Speaker 2>And we had some guards with those from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the for tribe,</v>

2313
01:55:11.290 --> 01:55:13.790
<v Speaker 2>but it's a bit dangerous there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he had an ak 47,</v>

2314
01:55:13.791 --> 01:55:17.750
<v Speaker 2>this guy and he sat there with his ak 47</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then we woke up one day and we had a</v>

2315
01:55:17.751 --> 01:55:22.751
<v Speaker 2>mountaineer with us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he got one of his mountaineering </v>

2316
01:55:22.751 --> 01:55:23.520
<v Speaker 2>ropes attached to his ak 47 and he sat </v>
<v Speaker 2>there now with this rope.</v>

2317
01:55:23.990 --> 01:55:28.990
<v Speaker 2>So the guy said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she should I ask for it back because I </v>

2318
01:55:28.990 --> 01:55:31.190
<v Speaker 2>know number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's attached to an ak 47,</v>

2319
01:55:31.940 --> 01:55:36.940
<v Speaker 2>which gives him the advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We didn't believe we get into an </v>

2320
01:55:36.940 --> 01:55:36.940
<v Speaker 2>argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And number two,</v>

2321
01:55:36.940 --> 01:55:37.850
<v Speaker 2>it's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea of possession.</v>

2322
01:55:37.970 --> 01:55:40.670
<v Speaker 2>But the reason I started saying that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we were filming.</v>

2323
01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:44.070
<v Speaker 2>We talk about meaning in life and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>said to this man who was called</v>

2324
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:46.980
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you didn't allie a guy at if our tribe,</v>

2325
01:55:47.040 --> 01:55:50.970
<v Speaker 1>small men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably four foot tall old.</v>

2326
01:55:51.060 --> 01:55:56.060
<v Speaker 1>And we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking to you about this through </v>

2327
01:55:56.060 --> 01:55:56.060
<v Speaker 1>a translator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said to us on camera,</v>

2328
01:55:56.060 --> 01:55:56.670
<v Speaker 1>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said your,</v>

2329
01:55:56.671 --> 01:55:59.610
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your eyes have your age,</v>

2330
01:55:59.640 --> 01:56:01.970
<v Speaker 1>but your ears have your father's age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

2331
01:56:01.971 --> 01:56:05.250
<v Speaker 1>your is here the past and your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See the president.</v>

2332
01:56:05.670 --> 01:56:10.670
<v Speaker 1>And this is the way you should live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just thought what a beautiful </v>

2333
01:56:10.921 --> 01:56:14.460
<v Speaker 1>thing that came out of this man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so we put that in the series just in</v>

2334
01:56:14.470 --> 01:56:17.460
<v Speaker 1>subtitled it and left it there because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's full of little.</v>

2335
01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:22.050
<v Speaker 1>Just people celebrating those people is </v>
<v Speaker 1>something you'd never see.</v>

2336
01:56:22.051 --> 01:56:27.051
<v Speaker 1>You don't think there are people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>live on volcanoes in northern Ethiopia </v>

2337
01:56:27.051 --> 01:56:27.630
<v Speaker 1>that say wonderful things about your </v>
<v Speaker 1>ears.</v>

2338
01:56:27.631 --> 01:56:32.631
<v Speaker 1>I've been your father's age and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>your eye in the past being used through </v>

2339
01:56:32.631 --> 01:56:35.910
<v Speaker 1>your ears to manipulate an informed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way you behave in the present.</v>

2340
01:56:35.940 --> 01:56:40.940
<v Speaker 1>Beautiful deep thoughts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we tried to fill the series with </v>

2341
01:56:40.940 --> 01:56:44.751
<v Speaker 1>those things as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a mixture of cosmology and the </v>

2342
01:56:44.751 --> 01:56:45.310
<v Speaker 1>celebration of the wonder of human </v>
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>

2343
01:56:45.311 --> 01:56:48.780
<v Speaker 1>The diversity of human thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was beautiful stuff in there.</v>

2344
01:56:49.170 --> 01:56:51.630
<v Speaker 1>A love letter to the human race and why </v>
<v Speaker 1>not?</v>

2345
01:56:51.631 --> 01:56:53.970
<v Speaker 1>Because we deserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we're so adaptabLe.</v>

2346
01:56:53.971 --> 01:56:58.971
<v Speaker 1>The idea that people can live like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>with no possessions the same time where </v>

2347
01:56:58.971 --> 01:57:00.220
<v Speaker 1>people will live in a world that the r </v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

2348
01:57:00.300 --> 01:57:04.110
<v Speaker 1>one of our biggest issues is that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>live to accumulate possessions.</v>

2349
01:57:04.410 --> 01:57:09.410
<v Speaker 1>And the idea of materialism is it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like it very much like you were </v>

2350
01:57:09.601 --> 01:57:14.601
<v Speaker 1>talking about the 17 year old boy that </v>
<v Speaker 1>only pays attention to video games that </v>

2351
01:57:14.601 --> 01:57:18.680
<v Speaker 1>becoming obsessed with anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's becoming obsessed with </v>

2352
01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:19.740
<v Speaker 1>objects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming obsessed with ideas.</v>

2353
01:57:19.900 --> 01:57:21.750
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're human beings,</v>

2354
01:57:21.810 --> 01:57:22.500
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2355
01:57:22.710 --> 01:57:27.710
<v Speaker 1>we are so flexible for so flexible in </v>
<v Speaker 1>how we can exist as a culture or as a </v>

2356
01:57:28.681 --> 01:57:33.060
<v Speaker 1>community that our ideas are so rigid </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people have to be this way.</v>

2357
01:57:33.060 --> 01:57:38.060
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't run around on the Internet </v>

2358
01:57:38.060 --> 01:57:38.770
<v Speaker 1>saying that there's no meaning to life </v>
<v Speaker 1>when jesus,</v>

2359
01:57:38.771 --> 01:57:43.771
<v Speaker 1>his name is being broadcast right now on</v>
<v Speaker 1>christian ministries all throughout the </v>

2360
01:57:43.771 --> 01:57:45.720
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They understand what the meaning of Life</v>

2361
01:57:45.721 --> 01:57:47.040
<v Speaker 1>is all about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian cox,</v>

2362
01:57:47.320 --> 01:57:49.500
<v Speaker 1>you are the one who is ignorant to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways of the lord.</v>

2363
01:57:49.530 --> 01:57:53.290
<v Speaker 1>And I do think that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I found is that travel.</v>

2364
01:57:53.291 --> 01:57:54.630
<v Speaker 1>Why would I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I filmed in,</v>

2365
01:57:54.930 --> 01:57:57.300
<v Speaker 1>I just fill it in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually freeing for the monkey cage</v>

2366
01:57:57.301 --> 01:58:00.090
<v Speaker 1>free monkey age because because we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing the show is in their life.</v>

2367
01:58:00.300 --> 01:58:02.070
<v Speaker 1>You have to have a different kind of us </v>
<v Speaker 1>visa.</v>

2368
01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:02.870
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2369
01:58:02.871 --> 01:58:04.350
<v Speaker 1>so and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the visa you have to put,</v>

2370
01:58:04.351 --> 01:58:06.630
<v Speaker 1>where were you been in the last five </v>
<v Speaker 1>years?</v>

2371
01:58:06.631 --> 01:58:11.631
<v Speaker 1>How many countries have you visited </v>
<v Speaker 1>within the last five years and it at 38 </v>

2372
01:58:11.880 --> 01:58:13.830
<v Speaker 1>I'd been to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fill in these things.</v>

2373
01:58:14.010 --> 01:58:15.960
<v Speaker 1>30 eight countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

2374
01:58:15.961 --> 01:58:16.860
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>

2375
01:58:16.861 --> 01:58:17.730
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>

2376
01:58:18.220 --> 01:58:23.220
<v Speaker 1>And what's interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I found it really honestly is that </v>

2377
01:58:23.220 --> 01:58:27.291
<v Speaker 1>when you go to Ethiopia or India or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan out into the wilds and these </v>

2378
01:58:27.291 --> 01:58:29.460
<v Speaker 1>places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people tend to be relatively.</v>

2379
01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:34.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone I've met is first of all but </v>

2380
01:58:34.760 --> 01:58:36.861
<v Speaker 1>interested in stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So through the translator with the </v>

2381
01:58:36.861 --> 01:58:40.580
<v Speaker 1>tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talk about the styles and I say as </v>

2382
01:58:40.580 --> 01:58:40.580
<v Speaker 1>I've got stars and they're interested so</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they don't,</v>

2383
01:58:40.650 --> 01:58:42.100
<v Speaker 1>they've never been to school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They</v>

2384
01:58:42.100 --> 01:58:43.390
<v Speaker 2>have their own education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're up,</v>

2385
01:58:43.391 --> 01:58:45.910
<v Speaker 2>they're learning about how to live in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>volcanic wasteland,</v>

2386
01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:51.240
<v Speaker 2>but yet they're interested and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>things they're interested in common I </v>

2387
01:58:51.240 --> 01:58:55.471
<v Speaker 2>find.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I genuinely am anyone that I found </v>

2388
01:58:55.471 --> 01:58:56.050
<v Speaker 2>uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was uncomfortable with.</v>

2389
01:58:56.080 --> 01:58:59.470
<v Speaker 2>I haven't met any of the maniacs that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>consider,</v>

2390
01:58:59.600 --> 01:59:01.630
<v Speaker 2>we think of as in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2391
01:59:01.631 --> 01:59:03.280
<v Speaker 2>we think well it's okay here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2392
01:59:03.290 --> 01:59:08.290
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in north America or in europe or </v>

2393
01:59:08.290 --> 01:59:08.290
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're okay,</v>

2394
01:59:08.290 --> 01:59:08.290
<v Speaker 2>but there's all these wild people out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

2395
01:59:08.290 --> 01:59:09.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something I know.</v>

2396
01:59:09.570 --> 01:59:11.410
<v Speaker 2>I just haven't seen any evidence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2397
01:59:11.411 --> 01:59:16.411
<v Speaker 2>And so that's part of human universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just trying to put these </v>

2398
01:59:16.411 --> 01:59:16.411
<v Speaker 2>impressions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2399
01:59:16.411 --> 01:59:17.500
<v Speaker 2>they believe different stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you might think,</v>

2400
01:59:17.780 --> 01:59:18.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said,</v>

2401
01:59:18.521 --> 01:59:20.380
<v Speaker 2>there's the people who say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well jesus is the way,</v>

2402
01:59:20.381 --> 01:59:25.381
<v Speaker 2>but then you'll go to India and you'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>find that there are people who are </v>

2403
01:59:25.381 --> 01:59:28.640
<v Speaker 2>hindus who strange beliefs towards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2404
01:59:29.210 --> 01:59:31.900
<v Speaker 2>ganesh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the blue elephant garden v,</v>

2405
01:59:33.150 --> 01:59:36.760
<v Speaker 2>they're part of that fabric of </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding the universe.</v>

2406
01:59:37.090 --> 01:59:40.480
<v Speaker 2>And I find it wonderful actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It tells you something,</v>

2407
01:59:40.510 --> 01:59:40.890
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2408
01:59:40.920 --> 01:59:45.920
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are some things that are cultural </v>

2409
01:59:45.920 --> 01:59:45.920
<v Speaker 2>and some things that are not religions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cultural.</v>

2410
01:59:45.920 --> 01:59:47.620
<v Speaker 2>You go different places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have different religions.</v>

2411
01:59:47.650 --> 01:59:51.250
<v Speaker 2>That's not to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although I don't have any interest,</v>

2412
01:59:51.430 --> 01:59:53.530
<v Speaker 2>any interest in religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always said people ask me quite a lot,</v>

2413
01:59:53.550 --> 01:59:54.630
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you really been gardens?</v>

2414
01:59:54.640 --> 01:59:55.490
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2415
01:59:55.510 --> 01:59:57.970
<v Speaker 2>but I don't really even think about it </v>
<v Speaker 2>until I get asked.</v>

2416
01:59:58.060 --> 02:00:00.730
<v Speaker 2>I would've never just stumbled across </v>
<v Speaker 2>that concept to myself.</v>

2417
02:00:01.170 --> 02:00:01.720
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2418
02:00:01.740 --> 02:00:04.120
<v Speaker 2>I get asked a lot now because I do </v>
<v Speaker 2>science on television.</v>

2419
02:00:04.360 --> 02:00:06.010
<v Speaker 2>I know he said the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is I don't really.</v>

2420
02:00:06.011 --> 02:00:07.860
<v Speaker 2>I'm not really interested.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think about it.</v>

2421
02:00:07.861 --> 02:00:09.160
<v Speaker 2>It's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that upset anybody?</v>

2422
02:00:10.020 --> 02:00:15.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of because I don't want to be </v>

2423
02:00:15.020 --> 02:00:15.020
<v Speaker 2>dismissed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to be missy and they just</v>

2424
02:00:15.020 --> 02:00:15.020
<v Speaker 2>talk about your own personal interests.</v>

2425
02:00:15.020 --> 02:00:17.760
<v Speaker 2>Does that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does that upset you?</v>

2426
02:00:17.800 --> 02:00:18.400
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're.</v>

2427
02:00:18.920 --> 02:00:20.590
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is I'm just reaffirming </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're saying.</v>

2428
02:00:20.770 --> 02:00:22.660
<v Speaker 2>You're just talking about your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>personal interests,</v>

2429
02:00:22.870 --> 02:00:27.870
<v Speaker 2>like why do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why does your personal lack of an </v>

2430
02:00:27.870 --> 02:00:30.250
<v Speaker 2>interest in something upset people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it seems to right?</v>

2431
02:00:30.310 --> 02:00:35.310
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can do because I think it says </v>

2432
02:00:35.310 --> 02:00:36.190
<v Speaker 2>central part of the framework they use </v>
<v Speaker 2>to explain the world and meeting and all</v>

2433
02:00:36.191 --> 02:00:37.570
<v Speaker 2>these questions that we're discussing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should.</v>

2434
02:00:37.571 --> 02:00:40.390
<v Speaker 2>Difficult questions and I think don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>have answers,</v>

2435
02:00:40.620 --> 02:00:41.950
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't eat it.</v>

2436
02:00:41.960 --> 02:00:45.040
<v Speaker 2>It's a complicated question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it mean to be alive?</v>

2437
02:00:45.300 --> 02:00:49.120
<v Speaker 2>And as we said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it obviously means something personally,</v>

2438
02:00:49.121 --> 02:00:51.340
<v Speaker 2>but I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are complicated question,</v>

2439
02:00:51.790 --> 02:00:56.790
<v Speaker 2>but I think what's interesting is you go</v>
<v Speaker 2>around the world and you see that these </v>

2440
02:00:56.790 --> 02:00:57.160
<v Speaker 2>questions are common and people think </v>
<v Speaker 2>about them in wherever they are,</v>

2441
02:00:57.161 --> 02:01:02.161
<v Speaker 2>wherever their level of education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have some framework for </v>

2442
02:01:02.161 --> 02:01:04.351
<v Speaker 2>understanding that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are also commonalities are </v>

2443
02:01:04.351 --> 02:01:04.351
<v Speaker 2>large.</v>

2444
02:01:04.351 --> 02:01:08.340
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the curiosity about the stars is </v>

2445
02:01:08.340 --> 02:01:10.590
<v Speaker 2>something that you see everywhere you </v>
<v Speaker 2>see the curiosity about the origins of </v>

2446
02:01:10.590 --> 02:01:13.240
<v Speaker 2>the universe and there are stories which</v>
<v Speaker 2>are different all over the world.</v>

2447
02:01:13.810 --> 02:01:17.230
<v Speaker 2>All in my view and in the human universe</v>
<v Speaker 2>view with an equally valid,</v>

2448
02:01:17.550 --> 02:01:18.030
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>

2449
02:01:18.031 --> 02:01:19.730
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're all worth it.</v>

2450
02:01:19.731 --> 02:01:22.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't consider it from them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're interesting.</v>

2451
02:01:22.660 --> 02:01:27.660
<v Speaker 2>They're interesting responses to nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's these people that live </v>

2452
02:01:27.660 --> 02:01:29.770
<v Speaker 2>around this volcano.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do they survive?</v>

2453
02:01:29.771 --> 02:01:32.400
<v Speaker 2>What are they eating?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they have goats.</v>

2454
02:01:32.570 --> 02:01:33.430
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2455
02:01:33.431 --> 02:01:38.431
<v Speaker 2>they managed to feed on the Limited tiny</v>
<v Speaker 2>amounts of limited vegetation that's </v>

2456
02:01:38.861 --> 02:01:40.310
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very little water.</v>

2457
02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:43.040
<v Speaker 2>So they're very careful with the water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2458
02:01:43.220 --> 02:01:48.220
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've developed this way of living </v>

2459
02:01:48.220 --> 02:01:48.500
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're remarkable,</v>

2460
02:01:48.710 --> 02:01:51.260
<v Speaker 2>tough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really tough bunch of people.</v>

2461
02:01:51.261 --> 02:01:56.261
<v Speaker 2>How many people live up there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know actually how big the font </v>

2462
02:01:56.261 --> 02:01:59.500
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's one of the Ethiopia is very </v>

2463
02:01:59.500 --> 02:01:59.500
<v Speaker 2>tribal and it goes into Eritrea as well.</v>

2464
02:01:59.500 --> 02:02:00.560
<v Speaker 2>So it's in this area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the top of the rift valley.</v>

2465
02:02:00.890 --> 02:02:04.970
<v Speaker 2>It's called the triple afar junction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a tectonics plate tectonics.</v>

2466
02:02:04.971 --> 02:02:07.340
<v Speaker 2>It's where all the volt vulcanism at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>top of the rift is.</v>

2467
02:02:07.550 --> 02:02:09.590
<v Speaker 2>So it's the generator of the rift </v>
<v Speaker 2>valley,</v>

2468
02:02:09.591 --> 02:02:11.480
<v Speaker 2>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is beautiful actually.</v>

2469
02:02:11.481 --> 02:02:14.270
<v Speaker 2>Is it an idea?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because this is the cradle of humanity.</v>

2470
02:02:14.530 --> 02:02:14.910
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

2471
02:02:14.930 --> 02:02:17.960
<v Speaker 2>so you've got this is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I find it a magical place actually.</v>

2472
02:02:17.961 --> 02:02:22.961
<v Speaker 2>Ethiopia for that reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it said I recommend it actually had </v>

2473
02:02:22.961 --> 02:02:24.800
<v Speaker 2>addie sandberg is a beautiful city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said high altitude city.</v>

2474
02:02:25.190 --> 02:02:26.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so Ethiopia tend to think of,</v>

2475
02:02:26.930 --> 02:02:28.580
<v Speaker 2>especially if you're a kid of my </v>
<v Speaker 2>generation,</v>

2476
02:02:28.581 --> 02:02:30.710
<v Speaker 2>you think in live aid and the big famine</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Ethiopia,</v>

2477
02:02:30.711 --> 02:02:32.840
<v Speaker 2>you think it is dusty place and it is in</v>
<v Speaker 2>some areas,</v>

2478
02:02:33.230 --> 02:02:34.460
<v Speaker 2>but actually the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the capital,</v>

2479
02:02:34.490 --> 02:02:37.520
<v Speaker 2>it's a very green countries is high </v>
<v Speaker 2>altitude,</v>

2480
02:02:37.521 --> 02:02:42.521
<v Speaker 2>quite pleasant city as some african </v>
<v Speaker 2>cities when they're very hot and they </v>

2481
02:02:42.521 --> 02:02:42.521
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>

2482
02:02:42.521 --> 02:02:46.970
<v Speaker 2>It can be very unusual for people like </v>
<v Speaker 2>us from places are not dusty and hot and</v>

2483
02:02:47.270 --> 02:02:50.010
<v Speaker 2>but at is not like that actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was and I,</v>

2484
02:02:50.011 --> 02:02:54.480
<v Speaker 2>I find this an idea when I go there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like the idea that because you,</v>

2485
02:02:54.481 --> 02:02:56.390
<v Speaker 2>you kind of almost know that we came </v>
<v Speaker 2>from there.</v>

2486
02:02:56.391 --> 02:02:58.310
<v Speaker 2>Somehow you come armed with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>knowledge.</v>

2487
02:02:58.311 --> 02:03:03.311
<v Speaker 2>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we were all related to someone who </v>

2488
02:03:03.311 --> 02:03:06.491
<v Speaker 2>lived here in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in and around adis abba in the rift </v>

2489
02:03:06.491 --> 02:03:11.170
<v Speaker 2>200,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago were all related to someone </v>

2490
02:03:11.170 --> 02:03:11.540
<v Speaker 2>who lived there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we wandered out from there.</v>

2491
02:03:11.541 --> 02:03:15.770
<v Speaker 2>I find that a powerful thought actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he dismisses,</v>

2492
02:03:15.890 --> 02:03:20.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the great deal of talk of differences </v>

2493
02:03:20.890 --> 02:03:20.930
<v Speaker 2>amongst us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually you go to Ethiopia,</v>

2494
02:03:20.931 --> 02:03:24.710
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you realize very soon that we're not far</v>

2495
02:03:24.711 --> 02:03:26.560
<v Speaker 2>back because you said you trace your </v>
<v Speaker 2>generators,</v>

2496
02:03:27.020 --> 02:03:27.940
<v Speaker 2>parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>father,</v>

2497
02:03:27.950 --> 02:03:29.100
<v Speaker 2>grandfather back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right back.</v>

2498
02:03:29.450 --> 02:03:32.390
<v Speaker 2>You don't go far back before you get to </v>
<v Speaker 2>an ethiopian.</v>

2499
02:03:33.180 --> 02:03:35.720
<v Speaker 2>She's quite wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

2500
02:03:35.721 --> 02:03:36.560
<v Speaker 2>It's so pretty</v>

2501
02:03:36.640 --> 02:03:40.010
<v Speaker 4>active enhancing to to see people in </v>
<v Speaker 4>this day and age.</v>

2502
02:03:40.011 --> 02:03:45.011
<v Speaker 4>I was watching a documentary on people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that live in the amazon that are barely </v>

2503
02:03:45.620 --> 02:03:48.380
<v Speaker 4>contacted by the western world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They sort of,</v>

2504
02:03:48.540 --> 02:03:52.160
<v Speaker 4>they made have like american underwear </v>
<v Speaker 4>or something that someone gives them.</v>

2505
02:03:52.400 --> 02:03:53.640
<v Speaker 4>But other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you know,</v>

2506
02:03:53.810 --> 02:03:58.810
<v Speaker 4>these people have been living </v>
<v Speaker 4>essentially very similar to the way </v>

2507
02:03:58.810 --> 02:04:00.920
<v Speaker 4>they've been living thousands of years </v>
<v Speaker 4>ago and they're getting by.</v>

2508
02:04:01.010 --> 02:04:04.010
<v Speaker 4>They're fine and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes you realize like how,</v>

2509
02:04:04.490 --> 02:04:09.490
<v Speaker 4>how this world that we live in right now</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we think everybody has to have an </v>

2510
02:04:09.490 --> 02:04:11.750
<v Speaker 4>email address,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody has to at least have some form</v>

2511
02:04:11.751 --> 02:04:13.610
<v Speaker 4>of public transportation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2512
02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:14.570
<v Speaker 4>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't.</v>

2513
02:04:14.571 --> 02:04:16.850
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to have anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These people all walk around,</v>

2514
02:04:17.060 --> 02:04:20.610
<v Speaker 4>they walk around in the jungle and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>live and they've been living like.</v>

2515
02:04:20.620 --> 02:04:25.620
<v Speaker 4>And They know what to eat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what not to eat and they know </v>

2516
02:04:25.620 --> 02:04:27.821
<v Speaker 4>what to avoid and they have babies and </v>
<v Speaker 4>their culture continues and they don't </v>

2517
02:04:27.821 --> 02:04:31.160
<v Speaker 4>even write things down and they'd been </v>
<v Speaker 4>living like that for a long time.</v>

2518
02:04:31.250 --> 02:04:32.990
<v Speaker 4>And they're people just like you and </v>
<v Speaker 4>just like me.</v>

2519
02:04:33.230 --> 02:04:34.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With the same.</v>

2520
02:04:35.660 --> 02:04:39.210
<v Speaker 2>I find the same level of curiosity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>interest is,</v>

2521
02:04:39.250 --> 02:04:41.520
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of sometime more so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>

2522
02:04:41.521 --> 02:04:42.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2523
02:04:42.540 --> 02:04:44.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2524
02:04:44.360 --> 02:04:46.680
<v Speaker 2>So it's very interested in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>

2525
02:04:46.790 --> 02:04:49.130
<v Speaker 3>The people that you contacted in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ethiopia,</v>

2526
02:04:49.160 --> 02:04:50.690
<v Speaker 3>how many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many are in their group,</v>

2527
02:04:50.930 --> 02:04:52.990
<v Speaker 3>the ones that you were in contact with </v>
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

2528
02:04:53.540 --> 02:04:58.540
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'd be guessing 100 or so in this </v>

2529
02:04:58.540 --> 02:04:59.500
<v Speaker 2>kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they have a writteN history?</v>

2530
02:05:00.040 --> 02:05:01.060
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2531
02:05:01.210 --> 02:05:03.070
<v Speaker 2>Oral history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2532
02:05:03.100 --> 02:05:06.650
<v Speaker 2>So these are stories passed down from </v>
<v Speaker 2>generation,</v>

2533
02:05:06.651 --> 02:05:08.830
<v Speaker 2>so they're great storytellers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2534
02:05:08.890 --> 02:05:13.890
<v Speaker 2>The results in these isolated tribes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviouslY Ethiopia is a </v>

2535
02:05:13.890 --> 02:05:18.181
<v Speaker 2>fascinating country because it's one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the few countries in africa that in an </v>

2536
02:05:18.181 --> 02:05:18.750
<v Speaker 2>ancient country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they,</v>

2537
02:05:18.770 --> 02:05:19.090
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

2538
02:05:19.100 --> 02:05:20.950
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in biblical times.</v>

2539
02:05:21.030 --> 02:05:26.030
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got these myths about when you </v>

2540
02:05:26.030 --> 02:05:26.030
<v Speaker 2>get to our this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they say we've got the uh,</v>

2541
02:05:26.030 --> 02:05:27.940
<v Speaker 2>the ark of the covenant running </v>
<v Speaker 2>cathedral in adis.</v>

2542
02:05:28.360 --> 02:05:29.200
<v Speaker 2>Then you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I see it?</v>

2543
02:05:29.201 --> 02:05:29.710
<v Speaker 2>And they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2544
02:05:31.030 --> 02:05:33.400
<v Speaker 2>but iT's there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I like the mythology.</v>

2545
02:05:33.401 --> 02:05:37.030
<v Speaker 2>The mythology is that the queen of sheba</v>
<v Speaker 2>was up there and stole it,</v>

2546
02:05:37.450 --> 02:05:42.450
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and came back and brought it back </v>

2547
02:05:42.450 --> 02:05:42.820
<v Speaker 2>selling author of king solomon and </v>
<v Speaker 2>solomon wouldn't.</v>

2548
02:05:42.930 --> 02:05:44.020
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you've got this.</v>

2549
02:05:44.230 --> 02:05:46.500
<v Speaker 2>It's all intertwined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the fact that they're,</v>

2550
02:05:46.501 --> 02:05:51.501
<v Speaker 2>they're written history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The central ethiopian written history </v>

2551
02:05:51.501 --> 02:05:51.501
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

2552
02:05:51.501 --> 02:05:53.290
<v Speaker 2>is in the biblical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in its,</v>

2553
02:05:53.350 --> 02:05:58.350
<v Speaker 2>in its spanish ancient Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were part of that thing that Egypt </v>

2554
02:05:58.350 --> 02:05:58.350
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2555
02:05:58.350 --> 02:06:03.060
<v Speaker 2>and in Ethiopia and then into jerusalem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those areas palestine and then out to </v>

2556
02:06:03.590 --> 02:06:04.450
<v Speaker 2>you that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2557
02:06:04.451 --> 02:06:09.451
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that thousand year old 2000 year old </v>

2558
02:06:09.451 --> 02:06:10.060
<v Speaker 2>history is part of that country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very centrally part of it.</v>

2559
02:06:10.390 --> 02:06:11.980
<v Speaker 2>Whereas usually in africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2560
02:06:12.020 --> 02:06:14.860
<v Speaker 2>you get countries that were divided up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they came after the second world war</v>

2561
02:06:14.861 --> 02:06:19.090
<v Speaker 2>and he post-imperial things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Ethiopia is a real,</v>

2562
02:06:20.010 --> 02:06:23.890
<v Speaker 2>a more grounded place in history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a fascinating place.</v>

2563
02:06:24.070 --> 02:06:29.070
<v Speaker 2>What is the area that's supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>contain the ark of the covenant that </v>

2564
02:06:29.070 --> 02:06:29.680
<v Speaker 2>cathedral allegedly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2565
02:06:29.930 --> 02:06:31.870
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this,</v>

2566
02:06:32.260 --> 02:06:33.760
<v Speaker 2>as I say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't allowed to see it,</v>

2567
02:06:33.761 --> 02:06:37.270
<v Speaker 2>so I'm very tied that exist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but only people were supposed to be like</v>

2568
02:06:37.271 --> 02:06:38.320
<v Speaker 2>looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many,</v>

2569
02:06:38.360 --> 02:06:41.980
<v Speaker 2>how nobody argues with this myth.</v>

2570
02:06:42.600 --> 02:06:47.220
<v Speaker 3>So is it like al capone's vault where </v>
<v Speaker 3>like it took joe geraldo rivera to break</v>

2571
02:06:47.221 --> 02:06:48.930
<v Speaker 3>down the wall before we realized there </v>
<v Speaker 3>was nothing in it.</v>

2572
02:06:49.080 --> 02:06:54.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is there like a room that no one goes </v>

2573
02:06:54.080 --> 02:06:55.851
<v Speaker 3>into?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think other than the priests and </v>

2574
02:06:55.851 --> 02:06:59.870
<v Speaker 3>things really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's because someone wants to </v>

2575
02:06:59.870 --> 02:07:04.851
<v Speaker 3>build the cathedral in and obviously the</v>
<v Speaker 3>queen of shiva stolen in the first </v>

2576
02:07:04.851 --> 02:07:05.550
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not there anymore.</v>

2577
02:07:05.551 --> 02:07:08.400
<v Speaker 3>It is let from jerusalem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2578
02:07:08.401 --> 02:07:09.740
<v Speaker 3>and brought it to Ethiopia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2579
02:07:09.741 --> 02:07:11.130
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And took it down to Ethiopia.</v>

2580
02:07:11.630 --> 02:07:16.630
<v Speaker 3>Managing if it is something that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some technological object from a </v>

2581
02:07:16.630 --> 02:07:16.820
<v Speaker 3>forgotten time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you under it and go,</v>

2582
02:07:16.830 --> 02:07:18.050
<v Speaker 3>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2583
02:07:18.720 --> 02:07:23.720
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop do you remember?</v>

2584
02:07:24.211 --> 02:07:25.190
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was,</v>

2585
02:07:25.220 --> 02:07:29.780
<v Speaker 3>there was some work that was done on </v>
<v Speaker 3>ancient batteries where they've,</v>

2586
02:07:29.790 --> 02:07:31.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they believe that some,</v>

2587
02:07:31.601 --> 02:07:36.601
<v Speaker 3>some of the artifacts they found like </v>
<v Speaker 3>egyptian pyramids perhaps might have </v>

2588
02:07:36.601 --> 02:07:36.601
<v Speaker 3>functioned in</v>

2589
02:07:36.601 --> 02:07:39.170
<v Speaker 2>a very similar way to a modern battery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw that.</v>

2590
02:07:39.180 --> 02:07:39.580
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2591
02:07:39.640 --> 02:07:43.810
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's possible I suppose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we,</v>

2592
02:07:44.290 --> 02:07:45.970
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we talked about timescales.</v>

2593
02:07:45.971 --> 02:07:48.950
<v Speaker 2>It's three and a half thousand for my </v>
<v Speaker 2>fans and years.</v>

2594
02:07:49.260 --> 02:07:49.720
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2595
02:07:49.730 --> 02:07:52.480
<v Speaker 2>the earliest pyramids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

2596
02:07:52.481 --> 02:07:53.620
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2597
02:07:53.621 --> 02:07:54.640
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't know.</v>

2598
02:07:54.670 --> 02:07:57.190
<v Speaker 2>We know quite a lot about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the egyptians.</v>

2599
02:07:57.490 --> 02:07:59.290
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's about human universe,</v>

2600
02:07:59.300 --> 02:08:01.620
<v Speaker 2>especially my monkey cage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'll talk about giving university as</v>

2601
02:08:01.621 --> 02:08:04.300
<v Speaker 2>well because we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we found um,</v>

2602
02:08:04.600 --> 02:08:09.600
<v Speaker 2>my wife actually started learning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Egyptians were just interested in </v>

2603
02:08:09.600 --> 02:08:12.181
<v Speaker 2>hieroglyphics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She just got some classes and the </v>

2604
02:08:12.181 --> 02:08:13.060
<v Speaker 2>literature from ancient Egypt is </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating.</v>

2605
02:08:13.061 --> 02:08:16.900
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about three year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2000 bc is things that have been written</v>

2606
02:08:16.901 --> 02:08:21.130
<v Speaker 2>down and the earliest I locked in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want it in the book of human universe,</v>

2607
02:08:21.131 --> 02:08:22.630
<v Speaker 2>which you can get in the us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should say.</v>

2608
02:08:22.930 --> 02:08:23.680
<v Speaker 2>I went into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2609
02:08:23.681 --> 02:08:24.910
<v Speaker 2>I want dailies literature.</v>

2610
02:08:24.940 --> 02:08:27.400
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's basically the,</v>

2611
02:08:27.430 --> 02:08:32.430
<v Speaker 2>one of the earliest things I could find </v>
<v Speaker 2>was basically monty python's parrot </v>

2612
02:08:32.430 --> 02:08:33.820
<v Speaker 2>sketch because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a complaint.</v>

2613
02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:36.160
<v Speaker 2>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wish to register a complaint.</v>

2614
02:08:37.490 --> 02:08:38.870
<v Speaker 2>It's a piece of papaya,</v>
<v Speaker 2>iris.</v>

2615
02:08:39.190 --> 02:08:41.530
<v Speaker 2>And it's a complaint about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2616
02:08:41.830 --> 02:08:42.510
<v Speaker 2>I think it was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2617
02:08:42.511 --> 02:08:43.040
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2618
02:08:43.041 --> 02:08:44.990
<v Speaker 2>the coffin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>

2619
02:08:45.080 --> 02:08:50.080
<v Speaker 2>as a coffee manufacturer who had </v>
<v Speaker 2>supplied this coffee and there was the </v>

2620
02:08:50.080 --> 02:08:50.830
<v Speaker 2>wrong size and it was kind of a bit of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>ripoff.</v>

2621
02:08:50.860 --> 02:08:53.230
<v Speaker 2>And this person said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm complaining about this,</v>

2622
02:08:53.231 --> 02:08:55.060
<v Speaker 2>I want to send it back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is terrible.</v>

2623
02:08:55.061 --> 02:08:56.510
<v Speaker 2>I want my money back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they'd say,</v>

2624
02:08:56.511 --> 02:08:58.090
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have two coffIns instead.</v>

2625
02:08:58.091 --> 02:08:59.830
<v Speaker 2>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want a voucher.</v>

2626
02:08:59.831 --> 02:09:03.370
<v Speaker 2>I want my money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so you see this was wonderful,</v>

2627
02:09:03.371 --> 02:09:07.710
<v Speaker 2>is it's a modern voice that echoes down </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ages from ancient Egypt that they,</v>

2628
02:09:07.720 --> 02:09:09.520
<v Speaker 2>most of them are either admin.</v>

2629
02:09:09.610 --> 02:09:13.330
<v Speaker 2>Things about my garden was nicked a bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>of my garden.</v>

2630
02:09:13.331 --> 02:09:15.700
<v Speaker 2>You moved the fence in the night or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>

2631
02:09:15.880 --> 02:09:18.230
<v Speaker 2>All complaining about some piece of </v>
<v Speaker 2>commerce like this is,</v>

2632
02:09:18.340 --> 02:09:22.240
<v Speaker 2>I've been ripped off by the shopkeeper </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's terrible and it's wonderful.</v>

2633
02:09:22.480 --> 02:09:25.240
<v Speaker 2>But then they're also poems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fantastic poems,</v>

2634
02:09:25.280 --> 02:09:30.280
<v Speaker 2>there's one about a woman talking to her</v>
<v Speaker 2>husband and under the awareness,</v>

2635
02:09:32.380 --> 02:09:34.800
<v Speaker 2>the husband talking to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so you go through and he's saying,</v>

2636
02:09:34.810 --> 02:09:36.970
<v Speaker 2>why did you leave me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why didn't you love me?</v>

2637
02:09:37.620 --> 02:09:42.620
<v Speaker 2>It's quite touch in a meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you realize towards the end </v>

2638
02:09:42.620 --> 02:09:42.620
<v Speaker 2>that this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2639
02:09:42.620 --> 02:09:42.620
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2640
02:09:42.620 --> 02:09:44.260
<v Speaker 2>woman died,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's dead,</v>

2641
02:09:44.770 --> 02:09:48.820
<v Speaker 2>but he's still talking to it like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the egyptians thought that,</v>

2642
02:09:49.270 --> 02:09:50.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she'd moved on,</v>

2643
02:09:50.770 --> 02:09:55.770
<v Speaker 2>conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a conscious decision to go into the </v>

2644
02:09:55.770 --> 02:09:58.591
<v Speaker 2>afterlife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so there's this kind of bitterness </v>

2645
02:09:58.591 --> 02:10:01.290
<v Speaker 2>being expressed and this really moving </v>
<v Speaker 2>piece of poetry and then you realize </v>

2646
02:10:01.290 --> 02:10:02.950
<v Speaker 2>that it's 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years old us,</v>

2647
02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:04.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's wonderful actually.</v>

2648
02:10:05.020 --> 02:10:07.930
<v Speaker 2>So you found,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we haven't changed at the point that you</v>

2649
02:10:07.931 --> 02:10:10.250
<v Speaker 2>find from this old literature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what will the,</v>

2650
02:10:10.300 --> 02:10:15.300
<v Speaker 2>one of the oldest pieces of human </v>
<v Speaker 2>language was the cuneiform right from </v>

2651
02:10:15.330 --> 02:10:17.920
<v Speaker 2>somewhere?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read this one thing that was,</v>

2652
02:10:18.190 --> 02:10:21.340
<v Speaker 2>there was a passage they were talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that was about divorce.</v>

2653
02:10:21.730 --> 02:10:23.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>iT was about marriage and divorce.</v>

2654
02:10:23.890 --> 02:10:25.660
<v Speaker 2>There was something along like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2655
02:10:26.110 --> 02:10:31.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget what it was like a sort of a </v>

2656
02:10:31.110 --> 02:10:33.860
<v Speaker 2>very short poem about divorce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about marriage</v>

2657
02:10:34.040 --> 02:10:35.270
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2658
02:10:36.050 --> 02:10:40.220
<v Speaker 1>for your relief or for your pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Divorce was very bizarre,</v>

2659
02:10:40.221 --> 02:10:45.221
<v Speaker 1>like the concept of two people uniting </v>
<v Speaker 1>by ritual existed six,</v>

2660
02:10:46.460 --> 02:10:47.360
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

2661
02:10:47.361 --> 02:10:52.361
<v Speaker 1>6,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago and they wrote about it in </v>

2662
02:10:52.361 --> 02:10:53.490
<v Speaker 1>these little scratches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2663
02:10:53.491 --> 02:10:58.491
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cuneiform which looks like ancient </v>

2664
02:10:58.491 --> 02:11:00.671
<v Speaker 1>nails with a flat top and a that points </v>
<v Speaker 1>down and then a certain pattern they've </v>

2665
02:11:01.221 --> 02:11:03.890
<v Speaker 1>been able to figure out that it means </v>
<v Speaker 1>some form,</v>

2666
02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:08.920
<v Speaker 1>some language that you can kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>attempt to translate to our modern </v>

2667
02:11:08.920 --> 02:11:10.160
<v Speaker 1>languages in a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clunky,</v>

2668
02:11:10.340 --> 02:11:11.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you ever read like Russia,</v>

2669
02:11:12.140 --> 02:11:15.530
<v Speaker 1>like the russian translations from </v>
<v Speaker 1>russian to english.</v>

2670
02:11:15.740 --> 02:11:19.130
<v Speaker 1>It's so bizarre because their language </v>
<v Speaker 1>is so alien to us.</v>

2671
02:11:19.131 --> 02:11:24.131
<v Speaker 1>It's so different that the way they use </v>
<v Speaker 1>pronouns and the subtext and all the </v>

2672
02:11:24.131 --> 02:11:28.710
<v Speaker 1>different aspects that we sort of take </v>
<v Speaker 1>for granted about language don't </v>

2673
02:11:28.710 --> 02:11:29.140
<v Speaker 1>translate correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2674
02:11:29.290 --> 02:11:34.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you think you mentioned that </v>

2675
02:11:34.290 --> 02:11:34.290
<v Speaker 1>hieroglyphics.</v>

2676
02:11:34.290 --> 02:11:38.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could I like the fact that the voice is </v>

2677
02:11:38.700 --> 02:11:41.210
<v Speaker 1>so familiar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We haven't changed the library of </v>

2678
02:11:41.210 --> 02:11:44.441
<v Speaker 1>alexandria man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the burning of the library of </v>

2679
02:11:44.441 --> 02:11:45.260
<v Speaker 1>alexandria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we had never taken place and we could</v>

2680
02:11:45.261 --> 02:11:50.261
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another go back and read all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the shit that they knew about </v>

2681
02:11:50.261 --> 02:11:54.431
<v Speaker 1>construction methods and how they built </v>
<v Speaker 1>those things and what was the purpose </v>

2682
02:11:54.431 --> 02:11:58.391
<v Speaker 1>behind them and what was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>significance of the astronaut </v>

2683
02:11:58.391 --> 02:11:59.250
<v Speaker 1>astrological alignment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

2684
02:11:59.260 --> 02:12:00.380
<v Speaker 1>what were they doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why were they,</v>

2685
02:12:01.150 --> 02:12:06.150
<v Speaker 1>what they were doing was so insane in </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparison to the greater some of </v>

2686
02:12:06.861 --> 02:12:09.200
<v Speaker 1>humanity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you look at humans,</v>

2687
02:12:09.420 --> 02:12:12.110
<v Speaker 1>2,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>bc and then you look at Egypt,</v>

2688
02:12:12.111 --> 02:12:14.330
<v Speaker 1>you like jesus christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck happened here?</v>

2689
02:12:14.510 --> 02:12:19.510
<v Speaker 1>How did you guys figure this shit out </v>
<v Speaker 1>that no one else anywhere near w w was </v>

2690
02:12:20.000 --> 02:12:22.680
<v Speaker 1>anywhere close to this level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sophistication.</v>

2691
02:12:23.080 --> 02:12:26.930
<v Speaker 1>Modern construction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second thing you can take from this,</v>

2692
02:12:26.960 --> 02:12:31.960
<v Speaker 1>because if you look at ancient Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so of course if you go to some of the </v>

2693
02:12:31.960 --> 02:12:33.950
<v Speaker 1>temples down there on denial and look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in particular,</v>

2694
02:12:33.951 --> 02:12:35.900
<v Speaker 1>it's just astonishing achievement.</v>

2695
02:12:36.280 --> 02:12:37.760
<v Speaker 1>I you that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You look at Greece,</v>

2696
02:12:37.790 --> 02:12:42.790
<v Speaker 1>you look at the greek literature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you look at the library of </v>

2697
02:12:42.790 --> 02:12:42.800
<v Speaker 1>alexandria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which the knowledge was lost because the</v>

2698
02:12:42.801 --> 02:12:47.801
<v Speaker 1>barbarians came and burn the thing down </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you realize that civilizations rise </v>

2699
02:12:47.801 --> 02:12:50.990
<v Speaker 1>and fall and knowledge can be lost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the the,</v>

2700
02:12:50.991 --> 02:12:52.580
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the romans,</v>

2701
02:12:52.581 --> 02:12:55.610
<v Speaker 1>I suspect though they were eternal as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization,</v>

2702
02:12:55.611 --> 02:12:57.440
<v Speaker 1>they were continuing to progress the </v>
<v Speaker 1>greeks before.</v>

2703
02:12:57.441 --> 02:12:59.720
<v Speaker 1>they haven't felt that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The egyptians thought that they didn't.</v>

2704
02:13:00.220 --> 02:13:04.970
<v Speaker 1>we think that now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's interesting to reflect,</v>

2705
02:13:04.971 --> 02:13:07.550
<v Speaker 1>I think on the fact that you don't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make progress.</v>

2706
02:13:07.980 --> 02:13:11.750
<v Speaker 1>The progress is in your own hands so you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can choose to make progress.</v>

2707
02:13:12.080 --> 02:13:15.140
<v Speaker 1>They didn't choose to make progress for </v>
<v Speaker 1>various reasons.</v>

2708
02:13:15.141 --> 02:13:20.141
<v Speaker 1>They stopped making progress and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>vanished and knowledge vantage with a </v>

2709
02:13:20.141 --> 02:13:21.350
<v Speaker 1>lot of the time and I think it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lesson for us.</v>

2710
02:13:21.380 --> 02:13:22.430
<v Speaker 1>We could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2711
02:13:22.431 --> 02:13:27.431
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just maybe we've got into this </v>

2712
02:13:27.431 --> 02:13:27.431
<v Speaker 1>position now with our technology were </v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

2713
02:13:27.431 --> 02:13:29.510
<v Speaker 1>it just won't go like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only we can take it for granted.</v>

2714
02:13:29.930 --> 02:13:32.370
<v Speaker 1>Which I think goes back to right back to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the start of the conversation</v>

2715
02:13:32.790 --> 02:13:34.770
<v Speaker 2>about how do we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do we say to people,</v>

2716
02:13:35.150 --> 02:13:35.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2717
02:13:35.550 --> 02:13:40.550
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a remarkable thing that we've </v>

2718
02:13:40.550 --> 02:13:40.550
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it don't take it for granted.</v>

2719
02:13:40.550 --> 02:13:44.661
<v Speaker 2>He's not just going to tick along while </v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys sit there and watch sports all </v>

2720
02:13:44.661 --> 02:13:44.661
<v Speaker 2>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2721
02:13:44.661 --> 02:13:46.380
<v Speaker 2>That's not the way that you make </v>
<v Speaker 2>progress.</v>

2722
02:13:46.381 --> 02:13:49.850
<v Speaker 2>Somebody got to do something and we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>all got to support the people.</v>

2723
02:13:50.070 --> 02:13:55.070
<v Speaker 2>Even if you don't want to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then support the people that want to do </v>

2724
02:13:55.070 --> 02:13:55.070
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you look at the,</v>

2725
02:13:55.250 --> 02:13:56.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

2726
02:13:56.100 --> 02:14:01.100
<v Speaker 2>I was filming with them on friday for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing I'm doing in britain with a rusty </v>

2727
02:14:01.100 --> 02:14:04.690
<v Speaker 2>spigot who's an apollo nine c test flu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lunar module and apollo nine in </v>

2728
02:14:04.690 --> 02:14:08.781
<v Speaker 2>1968.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First test flight of it in earth orbit </v>

2729
02:14:08.781 --> 02:14:10.020
<v Speaker 2>before they went to the moon in july of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that year.</v>

2730
02:14:10.680 --> 02:14:12.700
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

2731
02:14:12.990 --> 02:14:17.620
<v Speaker 2>so he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we landed on the moon actually in India.</v>

2732
02:14:17.650 --> 02:14:22.650
<v Speaker 2>We were in a simulator is terrific and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he showed me how to do it and it's </v>

2733
02:14:22.650 --> 02:14:22.650
<v Speaker 2>fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you look at nasa,</v>

2734
02:14:22.650 --> 02:14:27.500
<v Speaker 2>the investment in nasa at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was never more than four percent of </v>

2735
02:14:27.500 --> 02:14:28.470
<v Speaker 2>the federal expenditure and actually it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was often less than that,</v>

2736
02:14:28.600 --> 02:14:30.750
<v Speaker 2>so it wasn't particularly expensive on </v>
<v Speaker 2>average,</v>

2737
02:14:30.751 --> 02:14:32.700
<v Speaker 2>maybe about three percent of federal </v>
<v Speaker 2>expenditure,</v>

2738
02:14:33.210 --> 02:14:38.210
<v Speaker 2>but it laid the foundation I could argue</v>
<v Speaker 2>for american technological dominance in </v>

2739
02:14:38.210 --> 02:14:41.100
<v Speaker 2>the last quarter of the 20th century </v>
<v Speaker 2>because for example,</v>

2740
02:14:41.150 --> 02:14:46.150
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the average age of the engineers in the </v>

2741
02:14:46.150 --> 02:14:47.520
<v Speaker 2>nasa mission control when apollo 11 </v>
<v Speaker 2>landed on the moon was below 30,</v>

2742
02:14:48.030 --> 02:14:50.190
<v Speaker 2>below 30 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those engineers.</v>

2743
02:14:50.670 --> 02:14:52.620
<v Speaker 2>So what happened to them after the </v>
<v Speaker 2>apollo program,</v>

2744
02:14:52.621 --> 02:14:56.070
<v Speaker 2>they went out to work for boeing and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2745
02:14:56.520 --> 02:15:01.520
<v Speaker 2>microsoft bell labs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bell labs or lockheed martin or whoever </v>

2746
02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:01.520
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these people.</v>

2747
02:15:02.060 --> 02:15:07.060
<v Speaker 2>So you get this explosion in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in technological achievement,</v>

2748
02:15:07.111 --> 02:15:12.070
<v Speaker 2>in economic growth in America is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrific place to be a because in,</v>

2749
02:15:12.071 --> 02:15:17.071
<v Speaker 2>in many ways because of the growth that </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened in those 30 or 40 years since </v>

2750
02:15:17.071 --> 02:15:17.880
<v Speaker 2>apollo and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2751
02:15:18.240 --> 02:15:21.240
<v Speaker 2>but that was because of a conscious </v>
<v Speaker 2>investment led by,</v>

2752
02:15:21.241 --> 02:15:23.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kennedy's great speech and also inspired</v>

2753
02:15:23.191 --> 02:15:24.390
<v Speaker 2>by the cold war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

2754
02:15:24.390 --> 02:15:28.440
<v Speaker 2>There's many reasons why I did it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but ultimately that investment paid vast</v>

2755
02:15:28.441 --> 02:15:33.441
<v Speaker 2>dividends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look at nasa today and the </v>

2756
02:15:33.441 --> 02:15:36.081
<v Speaker 2>investment is way down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the ambition that the America had to </v>

2757
02:15:36.091 --> 02:15:39.480
<v Speaker 2>go to the moon because it's there and to</v>
<v Speaker 2>beat the russians yet,</v>

2758
02:15:39.510 --> 02:15:44.360
<v Speaker 2>but to do it and then that ambition </v>
<v Speaker 2>seems to be missing to me and I looked,</v>

2759
02:15:44.361 --> 02:15:44.800
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2760
02:15:45.090 --> 02:15:50.090
<v Speaker 2>I looked to this country actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think it is the country know </v>

2761
02:15:50.090 --> 02:15:50.210
<v Speaker 2>the country could have done that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get no,</v>

2762
02:15:50.220 --> 02:15:52.680
<v Speaker 2>the country could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gun moon will go.</v>

2763
02:15:52.770 --> 02:15:57.660
<v Speaker 2>I think before this decade is out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll go and they hadn't flown anyone in</v>

2764
02:15:57.661 --> 02:15:59.910
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When kennedy made that speech,</v>

2765
02:16:00.060 --> 02:16:02.250
<v Speaker 2>you hadn't flown anyone in space and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

2766
02:16:02.251 --> 02:16:03.720
<v Speaker 2>within 10 years I'm going to walk on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>moon.</v>

2767
02:16:03.870 --> 02:16:08.870
<v Speaker 2>That's an american thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think this is part of what's great </v>

2768
02:16:08.870 --> 02:16:12.141
<v Speaker 2>about this country and I regret the fact</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that doesn't seem to be there at </v>

2769
02:16:12.141 --> 02:16:15.411
<v Speaker 2>the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and going back to why I started saying </v>

2770
02:16:15.411 --> 02:16:15.411
<v Speaker 2>that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2771
02:16:15.411 --> 02:16:18.180
<v Speaker 2>the idea that progress is progress is </v>
<v Speaker 2>comes to the bold,</v>

2772
02:16:18.240 --> 02:16:18.420
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2773
02:16:18.420 --> 02:16:20.820
<v Speaker 2>I would say so the idea that it will </v>
<v Speaker 2>just come,</v>

2774
02:16:20.940 --> 02:16:24.360
<v Speaker 2>they will just make progress and is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily right.</v>

2775
02:16:24.390 --> 02:16:25.800
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>history tells us it's wrong,</v>

2776
02:16:26.040 --> 02:16:31.040
<v Speaker 2>so you've got to have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe bold visions and visionary </v>

2777
02:16:31.040 --> 02:16:32.500
<v Speaker 2>leaders and leaders are just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2778
02:16:32.740 --> 02:16:35.260
<v Speaker 2>this is not a great deflection of </v>
<v Speaker 2>resources.</v>

2779
02:16:35.470 --> 02:16:36.250
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I say,</v>

2780
02:16:36.251 --> 02:16:39.850
<v Speaker 2>it was always less than three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four percent of federal expenditure,</v>

2781
02:16:40.270 --> 02:16:45.270
<v Speaker 2>but it's a great reflection of national </v>
<v Speaker 2>will and it's a great generator of fsc,</v>

2782
02:16:45.490 --> 02:16:50.490
<v Speaker 2>of engineers and scientists who are </v>
<v Speaker 2>inspired by those things and trained in </v>

2783
02:16:50.490 --> 02:16:54.781
<v Speaker 2>that process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy into the economy make the </v>

2784
02:16:54.781 --> 02:16:56.641
<v Speaker 2>economy better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a study that suggested it was a </v>

2785
02:16:56.641 --> 02:16:59.821
<v Speaker 2>14 to one return on every dollar </v>
<v Speaker 2>invested in apollo by 1980 and people </v>

2786
02:17:00.191 --> 02:17:03.850
<v Speaker 2>can argue about the um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 10 to was 14 to one.</v>

2787
02:17:03.851 --> 02:17:08.851
<v Speaker 2>Was it 22?</v>
<v Speaker 2>One is the return to the private sector </v>

2788
02:17:08.851 --> 02:17:09.630
<v Speaker 2>or return to the government that gdp </v>
<v Speaker 2>into,</v>

2789
02:17:09.670 --> 02:17:12.290
<v Speaker 2>in just into wealth generated.</v>

2790
02:17:12.600 --> 02:17:17.600
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so each one made tang each one of those </v>

2791
02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:20.260
<v Speaker 2>dollars generating at least 10 and maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 in a decade.</v>

2792
02:17:20.320 --> 02:17:25.320
<v Speaker 2>And it's obvious how it did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because look at those young engineers </v>

2793
02:17:25.320 --> 02:17:26.590
<v Speaker 2>and look at the technologies that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>developed for a follow.</v>

2794
02:17:26.740 --> 02:17:29.230
<v Speaker 2>Someone said to me at nasa ames up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>san francisco,</v>

2795
02:17:29.440 --> 02:17:34.440
<v Speaker 2>virtually virtually every technology and</v>
<v Speaker 2>commercial aviation today got invented </v>

2796
02:17:34.440 --> 02:17:37.930
<v Speaker 2>there in at nasa ames.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually most of it,</v>

2797
02:17:38.050 --> 02:17:40.030
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can point to one place and go,</v>

2798
02:17:40.130 --> 02:17:45.130
<v Speaker 2>that's where everything I take for </v>
<v Speaker 2>granted when I get in an aircraft came </v>

2799
02:17:45.130 --> 02:17:47.300
<v Speaker 2>from that almost directly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it's because of the,</v>

2800
02:17:47.320 --> 02:17:52.320
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ending of the cold war or the lack </v>

2801
02:17:52.320 --> 02:17:52.320
<v Speaker 2>of competition with Russia?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's.</v>

2802
02:17:52.320 --> 02:17:53.860
<v Speaker 2>We were on top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we just got soft.</v>

2803
02:17:53.861 --> 02:17:56.020
<v Speaker 2>There was no need to keep pushing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressing.</v>

2804
02:17:56.170 --> 02:18:01.170
<v Speaker 2>There wasn't an adversary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There wasn't this technological </v>

2805
02:18:01.170 --> 02:18:04.171
<v Speaker 2>adversary that's out there that gives </v>
<v Speaker 2>people the motivation to continue to </v>

2806
02:18:04.171 --> 02:18:04.171
<v Speaker 2>invest.</v>

2807
02:18:04.171 --> 02:18:05.870
<v Speaker 2>Forty percent of the gross domestic </v>
<v Speaker 2>product or whatever,</v>

2808
02:18:05.890 --> 02:18:07.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever the.</v>

2809
02:18:07.240 --> 02:18:10.840
<v Speaker 2>The amount of money we need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2810
02:18:10.841 --> 02:18:13.120
<v Speaker 2>It seems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to look at britain,</v>

2811
02:18:13.150 --> 02:18:17.590
<v Speaker 2>so I talk about my country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which did the big thing around the world</v>

2812
02:18:17.591 --> 02:18:20.230
<v Speaker 2>and then declined.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't run the world anymore.</v>

2813
02:18:20.530 --> 02:18:22.660
<v Speaker 2>Handed it over to you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys had a little island.</v>

2814
02:18:22.661 --> 02:18:24.220
<v Speaker 2>He ran it out of an island.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty dope.</v>

2815
02:18:24.520 --> 02:18:26.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have a big ass continent.</v>

2816
02:18:27.340 --> 02:18:30.190
<v Speaker 2>We set off in the wrong place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did it out of Rhode Island.</v>

2817
02:18:31.420 --> 02:18:34.130
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of smaller than California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2818
02:18:34.230 --> 02:18:36.550
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty crazy for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>not bad,</v>

2819
02:18:36.770 --> 02:18:40.820
<v Speaker 2>but it seems to me that what we lack is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

2820
02:18:40.821 --> 02:18:42.760
<v Speaker 2>These things are not expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

2821
02:18:42.761 --> 02:18:44.650
<v Speaker 2>they're vital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They generate money,</v>

2822
02:18:44.910 --> 02:18:49.910
<v Speaker 2>so it seems to me it's leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's visionary leadership by </v>

2823
02:18:49.910 --> 02:18:50.620
<v Speaker 2>inspiration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2824
02:18:50.710 --> 02:18:52.480
<v Speaker 2>and it doesn't take it well.</v>

2825
02:18:52.510 --> 02:18:53.960
<v Speaker 2>I was gonna say it doesn't take much </v>
<v Speaker 2>clear.</v>

2826
02:18:53.970 --> 02:18:55.770
<v Speaker 2>It took a kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

2827
02:18:55.771 --> 02:18:57.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean that speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a remarkable speech.</v>

2828
02:18:57.490 --> 02:19:02.490
<v Speaker 2>Rallies a nation beyond something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not a particularly large </v>

2829
02:19:02.490 --> 02:19:04.350
<v Speaker 2>diversion of resources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the point and certainly given the</v>

2830
02:19:04.390 --> 02:19:07.080
<v Speaker 2>what you get back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems to me the investment in r and d</v>

2831
02:19:07.081 --> 02:19:12.081
<v Speaker 2>in science and technology and education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are the things that formed the </v>

2832
02:19:12.081 --> 02:19:12.370
<v Speaker 2>foundation of our future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

2833
02:19:12.460 --> 02:19:14.800
<v Speaker 2>And everybody agrees with that and I get</v>
<v Speaker 2>very involved.</v>

2834
02:19:14.801 --> 02:19:18.010
<v Speaker 2>I get involved in politics in britain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not party politics,</v>

2835
02:19:18.011 --> 02:19:21.370
<v Speaker 2>but this lobbying for this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spend money on the young,</v>

2836
02:19:21.520 --> 02:19:24.820
<v Speaker 2>spend money on education system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spend money on inspiration,</v>

2837
02:19:25.030 --> 02:19:30.030
<v Speaker 2>make sure that there's a generation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these great engineers and scientists </v>

2838
02:19:30.500 --> 02:19:33.140
<v Speaker 2>that America is currently well leading </v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

2839
02:19:33.200 --> 02:19:34.750
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2840
02:19:35.210 --> 02:19:37.160
<v Speaker 2>and make sure that they're still there </v>
<v Speaker 2>and make sure.</v>

2841
02:19:37.280 --> 02:19:38.120
<v Speaker 2>And how do you get them?</v>

2842
02:19:38.120 --> 02:19:43.120
<v Speaker 2>How do you inspire them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want kids to want to be a </v>

2843
02:19:43.120 --> 02:19:43.670
<v Speaker 2>singer's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly annex x factor.</v>

2844
02:19:43.671 --> 02:19:48.671
<v Speaker 2>I don't want them to be famed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When there was a survey done recently I </v>

2845
02:19:48.671 --> 02:19:48.671
<v Speaker 2>think where they said to the lower </v>
<v Speaker 2>school kids what you want to be when you</v>

2846
02:19:48.671 --> 02:19:49.520
<v Speaker 2>grow up and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2847
02:19:49.550 --> 02:19:51.080
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of them said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>famous,</v>

2848
02:19:51.800 --> 02:19:53.840
<v Speaker 2>famous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean famous?</v>

2849
02:19:53.900 --> 02:19:55.760
<v Speaker 2>You want to walk on the moon?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you want to.</v>

2850
02:19:55.761 --> 02:19:58.170
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to invent the world's </v>
<v Speaker 2>fastest computer?</v>

2851
02:19:58.171 --> 02:20:00.170
<v Speaker 2>Don't do you want it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean famous?</v>

2852
02:20:00.200 --> 02:20:05.200
<v Speaker 2>You've got to be famous for something </v>
<v Speaker 2>not famous because you want a talent </v>

2853
02:20:05.200 --> 02:20:05.200
<v Speaker 2>show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We go back to the pole.</v>

2854
02:20:05.200 --> 02:20:09.560
<v Speaker 2>Can kardashians?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd never seen the cardassians by the </v>

2855
02:20:09.560 --> 02:20:11.831
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who the hell they are and </v>

2856
02:20:11.831 --> 02:20:11.831
<v Speaker 2>thank god I don't because I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't,</v>

2857
02:20:11.831 --> 02:20:12.590
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we have them in britain </v>
<v Speaker 2>that maybe we do,</v>

2858
02:20:12.591 --> 02:20:13.490
<v Speaker 2>but they get over there.</v>

2859
02:20:13.520 --> 02:20:14.510
<v Speaker 2>Do they get over that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd done it,</v>

2860
02:20:14.570 --> 02:20:16.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I want to pick on that lot.</v>

2861
02:20:16.220 --> 02:20:17.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're doing what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2862
02:20:17.421 --> 02:20:21.800
<v Speaker 2>But the point is you don't want to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of those without being disrespect.</v>

2863
02:20:21.801 --> 02:20:23.680
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're having a good time,</v>

2864
02:20:24.470 --> 02:20:29.470
<v Speaker 2>find insult people and then at the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>time people kind make their make their </v>

2865
02:20:29.510 --> 02:20:30.010
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2866
02:20:30.020 --> 02:20:32.550
<v Speaker 2>and do well and they're not criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not evil people.</v>

2867
02:20:32.660 --> 02:20:37.660
<v Speaker 2>They're not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those is what do you want to aspire to </v>

2868
02:20:37.660 --> 02:20:37.660
<v Speaker 2>be as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a kid?</v>

2869
02:20:37.660 --> 02:20:38.840
<v Speaker 2>What do you want to aspire to be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's true.</v>

2870
02:20:38.841 --> 02:20:40.940
<v Speaker 2>They're in their sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted it to be neil armstrong,</v>

2871
02:20:41.270 --> 02:20:46.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or one of the engineers in mission </v>

2872
02:20:46.270 --> 02:20:46.270
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a government government has.</v>

2873
02:20:46.270 --> 02:20:47.520
<v Speaker 2>I know it's kind of unfashionable in </v>
<v Speaker 2>some circles,</v>

2874
02:20:47.720 --> 02:20:50.630
<v Speaker 2>but government sets the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sets the direction in the,</v>

2875
02:20:50.840 --> 02:20:51.570
<v Speaker 2>it has to.</v>

2876
02:20:52.130 --> 02:20:53.540
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2877
02:20:53.990 --> 02:20:56.930
<v Speaker 2>companies can do it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have the big companies like apple</v>

2878
02:20:56.931 --> 02:21:00.230
<v Speaker 2>and google and so people do aspire to </v>
<v Speaker 2>work with those companies,</v>

2879
02:21:00.410 --> 02:21:05.410
<v Speaker 2>but I think the grand direction of </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization is set by set by </v>

2880
02:21:05.410 --> 02:21:08.660
<v Speaker 2>governments and visionaries and and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's not expensive,</v>

2881
02:21:09.050 --> 02:21:10.850
<v Speaker 2>but it's terrifically expensive not to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do it.</v>

2882
02:21:11.240 --> 02:21:16.240
<v Speaker 2>For governmenTs to the idea of </v>
<v Speaker 2>government is really been hijacked in </v>

2883
02:21:16.240 --> 02:21:17.720
<v Speaker 2>this country and come apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Money being catalytic,</v>

2884
02:21:18.580 --> 02:21:19.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2885
02:21:19.790 --> 02:21:21.920
<v Speaker 2>it depends what you mean by government </v>
<v Speaker 2>and big government,</v>

2886
02:21:21.921 --> 02:21:24.210
<v Speaker 2>small government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>special interest groups and the</v>

2887
02:21:24.210 --> 02:21:28.050
<v Speaker 4>law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's just too much money involved.</v>

2888
02:21:28.080 --> 02:21:33.080
<v Speaker 4>The complaints being there's legal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like absolutely legal corruption in this</v>

2889
02:21:34.471 --> 02:21:39.471
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we're giant corporations are </v>

2890
02:21:39.471 --> 02:21:42.801
<v Speaker 4>allowed to invest enormous sums of money</v>
<v Speaker 4>into candidates that will,</v>

2891
02:21:43.020 --> 02:21:46.920
<v Speaker 4>once they get into office,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you do the bidding of these corporations</v>

2892
02:21:46.921 --> 02:21:48.720
<v Speaker 4>manipulate laws,</v>
<v Speaker 4>move things around,</v>

2893
02:21:48.760 --> 02:21:51.720
<v Speaker 4>make things easier for these </v>
<v Speaker 4>corporations to manipulate our society.</v>

2894
02:21:52.080 --> 02:21:54.540
<v Speaker 4>That's a realIty and that's very </v>
<v Speaker 4>unfortunate.</v>

2895
02:21:54.541 --> 02:21:59.541
<v Speaker 4>But I think that's a reality that's also</v>
<v Speaker 4>being a roading or eroding rather by </v>

2896
02:21:59.541 --> 02:22:03.891
<v Speaker 4>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think people understanding the </v>

2897
02:22:03.891 --> 02:22:06.501
<v Speaker 4>mechanisms involved in government is </v>
<v Speaker 4>making them want to change those </v>

2898
02:22:06.501 --> 02:22:08.640
<v Speaker 4>mechanisms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People pushing for ideas lIke being able</v>

2899
02:22:08.641 --> 02:22:13.641
<v Speaker 4>to vote online.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is like people were really </v>

2900
02:22:13.641 --> 02:22:15.270
<v Speaker 4>frustrated by this oil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How come I can bank online?</v>

2901
02:22:15.480 --> 02:22:20.480
<v Speaker 4>how come you can deal with the entire </v>
<v Speaker 4>world's economy through computers and </v>

2902
02:22:20.480 --> 02:22:20.480
<v Speaker 4>the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can't vote?</v>

2903
02:22:20.670 --> 02:22:24.420
<v Speaker 4>How come is it because you don't want it</v>
<v Speaker 4>to be that easy for people to give their</v>

2904
02:22:24.421 --> 02:22:26.310
<v Speaker 4>opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people to vote because</v>

2905
02:22:26.520 --> 02:22:30.510
<v Speaker 1>the world of the internet and the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>of of actual voting there too,</v>

2906
02:22:30.520 --> 02:22:35.520
<v Speaker 1>there's a big gap between them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a big gap that would instantly </v>

2907
02:22:35.520 --> 02:22:38.360
<v Speaker 1>shift right over if you were allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>vote online and these people this,</v>

2908
02:22:38.420 --> 02:22:39.690
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's problems with that.</v>

2909
02:22:39.691 --> 02:22:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>corruption,</v>

2910
02:22:40.531 --> 02:22:45.531
<v Speaker 1>oh this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you're the one who's always worried </v>

2911
02:22:45.531 --> 02:22:45.531
<v Speaker 1>about hacking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2912
02:22:45.531 --> 02:22:45.531
<v Speaker 1>guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be the case.</v>

2913
02:22:45.531 --> 02:22:46.460
<v Speaker 1>No matter what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's goIng to.</v>

2914
02:22:46.500 --> 02:22:49.470
<v Speaker 1>There's all sorts of problems with </v>
<v Speaker 1>voting the conventional way.</v>

2915
02:22:49.680 --> 02:22:54.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've had giant scandals and diebold </v>

2916
02:22:54.680 --> 02:22:56.610
<v Speaker 1>voting machines that contained the third</v>
<v Speaker 1>party access,</v>

2917
02:22:57.110 --> 02:22:59.700
<v Speaker 1>the ability to manipulate the data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all been proven.</v>

2918
02:22:59.701 --> 02:23:04.701
<v Speaker 1>There was a documentary called hacking </v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy that showed how ludicrous it </v>

2919
02:23:04.701 --> 02:23:07.290
<v Speaker 1>is to think that our system that's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>place right now is is infallible,</v>

2920
02:23:07.380 --> 02:23:08.250
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>

2921
02:23:08.251 --> 02:23:13.251
<v Speaker 1>it's massively flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The technology that exists because of </v>

2922
02:23:13.511 --> 02:23:18.511
<v Speaker 1>the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the ability to exchange </v>

2923
02:23:18.511 --> 02:23:19.140
<v Speaker 1>information instantaneously with each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other is unprecedented,</v>

2924
02:23:19.530 --> 02:23:23.790
<v Speaker 1>and I think that is going to shift the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea of government that's going to shit.</v>

2925
02:23:23.790 --> 02:23:28.790
<v Speaker 1>It's going to scatter all these crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are running things right </v>

2926
02:23:28.790 --> 02:23:30.180
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to be viable anymore.</v>

2927
02:23:30.181 --> 02:23:35.181
<v Speaker 1>just like kings aren't viable anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't be henry the eighth in 2015 </v>

2928
02:23:35.181 --> 02:23:36.990
<v Speaker 1>unless you're the guy in North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like the last one,</v>

2929
02:23:37.290 --> 02:23:42.290
<v Speaker 1>but most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most governments can't be run the way </v>

2930
02:23:42.290 --> 02:23:44.610
<v Speaker 1>they were run thousands of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's too much access to information.</v>

2931
02:23:44.760 --> 02:23:47.610
<v Speaker 1>We know you're not a god.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know you're just a person.</v>

2932
02:23:47.820 --> 02:23:48.410
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

2933
02:23:48.450 --> 02:23:53.450
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have this ability to exchange these </v>

2934
02:23:53.450 --> 02:23:55.350
<v Speaker 1>ideas so quickly that the word gets out </v>
<v Speaker 1>too fast.</v>

2935
02:23:55.690 --> 02:24:00.690
<v Speaker 1>You're listening to tim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ben is lee when he talks about the </v>

2936
02:24:00.690 --> 02:24:01.380
<v Speaker 1>worldwide web and eventually by the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>it said,</v>

2937
02:24:01.400 --> 02:24:05.580
<v Speaker 1>of course the web bits of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then then he talks in those terms.</v>

2938
02:24:05.581 --> 02:24:10.581
<v Speaker 1>Actually he's quite idealistic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly I am a freedom of information </v>

2939
02:24:11.281 --> 02:24:13.350
<v Speaker 1>free exchange of information and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're right.</v>

2940
02:24:13.350 --> 02:24:15.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean it goes right back to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of the conversation,</v>

2941
02:24:15.571 --> 02:24:18.420
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it is a good thing or a bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing on the web.</v>

2942
02:24:18.500 --> 02:24:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Let's say a good thing or a bad thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you must be right in this sentence </v>

2943
02:24:23.500 --> 02:24:26.481
<v Speaker 1>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as people you know you need to </v>

2944
02:24:26.481 --> 02:24:29.160
<v Speaker 1>set and we're having this conversation </v>
<v Speaker 1>at quite a high level.</v>

2945
02:24:29.180 --> 02:24:34.180
<v Speaker 1>if you know we're talking about great </v>
<v Speaker 1>movements and great shifts in </v>

2946
02:24:34.180 --> 02:24:36.540
<v Speaker 1>civilization and so I suppose you need </v>
<v Speaker 1>a.</v>

2947
02:24:36.960 --> 02:24:40.140
<v Speaker 1>You need the perspective first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you need the.</v>

2948
02:24:40.400 --> 02:24:45.240
<v Speaker 1>You need your appetite stimulating for </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge and information and to use not</v>

2949
02:24:45.390 --> 02:24:48.090
<v Speaker 1>to use the internet or the web to get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>as yourself,</v>

2950
02:24:48.150 --> 02:24:53.150
<v Speaker 1>you need to have some instinct that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to just go find the little </v>

2951
02:24:53.150 --> 02:24:56.691
<v Speaker 1>sliver of information that interests me </v>
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps inflammation that's </v>

2952
02:24:56.691 --> 02:24:57.250
<v Speaker 1>nonsensical and is also the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2953
02:24:57.270 --> 02:25:02.270
<v Speaker 1>how you you can go and be a conspiracy </v>
<v Speaker 1>theorist and find plenty of information </v>

2954
02:25:02.270 --> 02:25:05.811
<v Speaker 1>to support your conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He will see that tool kit so you can </v>

2955
02:25:05.811 --> 02:25:06.180
<v Speaker 1>always talks about this in the demon </v>
<v Speaker 1>haunted world.</v>

2956
02:25:06.181 --> 02:25:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by giving people a toolkit.</v>

2957
02:25:08.130 --> 02:25:09.800
<v Speaker 1>Bullshit detectors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he called it,</v>

2958
02:25:09.801 --> 02:25:12.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the education science,</v>

2959
02:25:12.210 --> 02:25:16.560
<v Speaker 1>the scientific method that that's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit detector kit basically.</v>

2960
02:25:16.740 --> 02:25:19.220
<v Speaker 1>So if you can get that in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get that in.</v>

2961
02:25:19.230 --> 02:25:21.600
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this is the priority really in </v>
<v Speaker 1>schools to say,</v>

2962
02:25:21.601 --> 02:25:24.250
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to know how to think,</v>

2963
02:25:24.340 --> 02:25:27.490
<v Speaker 2>how to look information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>assess where the information came from,</v>

2964
02:25:27.660 --> 02:25:32.500
<v Speaker 2>understanding if it's likely to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>tainted or biased or good or bad,</v>

2965
02:25:32.501 --> 02:25:36.460
<v Speaker 2>or how do I assess this vast quantity </v>
<v Speaker 2>information out there?</v>

2966
02:25:36.670 --> 02:25:38.110
<v Speaker 2>How do I not get it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas myself,</v>

2967
02:25:38.200 --> 02:25:40.480
<v Speaker 2>how do I decide that I'm only going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>read,</v>

2968
02:25:40.510 --> 02:25:44.170
<v Speaker 2>I'm only going to is the external forums</v>
<v Speaker 2>that say that we didn't land on the moon</v>

2969
02:25:44.171 --> 02:25:46.420
<v Speaker 2>and there was a big conspiracy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone covered it up.</v>

2970
02:25:46.570 --> 02:25:49.210
<v Speaker 2>How?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How can I broaden my reach to say,</v>

2971
02:25:49.211 --> 02:25:54.211
<v Speaker 2>is that really true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shall I check some other stuff like the </v>

2972
02:25:54.211 --> 02:25:57.030
<v Speaker 2>telescopes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That way you can look at the spacecraft </v>

2973
02:25:57.030 --> 02:25:57.030
<v Speaker 2>on the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that kind of bits of evidence.</v>

2974
02:25:57.310 --> 02:26:02.310
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's very important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it ironic that in this day and age</v>

2975
02:26:02.861 --> 02:26:07.861
<v Speaker 2>we accumulate more data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there was some statistic about </v>

2976
02:26:07.861 --> 02:26:10.630
<v Speaker 2>in every two days we accumulate more </v>
<v Speaker 2>data,</v>

2977
02:26:10.660 --> 02:26:15.660
<v Speaker 2>more like numbers and a lot of it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably instagram pictures and twitter </v>

2978
02:26:15.660 --> 02:26:19.270
<v Speaker 2>and shit that's useless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that more hard data gets accumulated</v>

2979
02:26:19.271 --> 02:26:22.990
<v Speaker 2>or processed or or or produced by humans</v>
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

2980
02:26:23.170 --> 02:26:27.640
<v Speaker 2>Then the entire time of human history up</v>
<v Speaker 2>to that point,</v>

2981
02:26:27.910 --> 02:26:30.520
<v Speaker 2>which is fucking staggering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2982
02:26:30.550 --> 02:26:35.550
<v Speaker 2>but it also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of it takes place on computers.</v>

2983
02:26:36.160 --> 02:26:41.160
<v Speaker 2>The most of it is ones and zeros.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of it takes place in a language </v>

2984
02:26:41.160 --> 02:26:44.730
<v Speaker 2>that you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I can't even read if it was written </v>

2985
02:26:44.730 --> 02:26:44.730
<v Speaker 2>on a piece of paper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one.</v>

2986
02:26:44.730 --> 02:26:48.150
<v Speaker 2>And it's a big subject.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how do you use data and how do we </v>

2987
02:26:48.150 --> 02:26:48.150
<v Speaker 2>use it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's.</v>

2988
02:26:48.220 --> 02:26:52.180
<v Speaker 2>There's an example that the program I do</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the uk called stargazing live.</v>

2989
02:26:52.210 --> 02:26:55.330
<v Speaker 2>She'll live astronomy show on the bbc </v>
<v Speaker 2>and lots of people watch it.</v>

2990
02:26:55.331 --> 02:27:00.331
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of people like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that we do a citizen </v>

2991
02:27:00.331 --> 02:27:03.190
<v Speaker 2>science projects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so for example last year that we use the</v>

2992
02:27:03.191 --> 02:27:06.730
<v Speaker 2>european space agency's database of </v>
<v Speaker 2>photographs of the surface of mars.</v>

2993
02:27:07.240 --> 02:27:09.130
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's ever looked at them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2994
02:27:09.180 --> 02:27:09.850
<v Speaker 2>There's too many of them.</v>

2995
02:27:10.000 --> 02:27:15.000
<v Speaker 2>So we've got too many pitches of miles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one know human eyes have ever looked </v>

2996
02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:18.631
<v Speaker 2>at these pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we ran a project where we wanted to </v>

2997
02:27:18.631 --> 02:27:22.141
<v Speaker 2>answer a question about some features </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're seeing moving across the </v>

2998
02:27:22.141 --> 02:27:26.101
<v Speaker 2>surface of mars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weather features that we thought may be </v>

2999
02:27:26.101 --> 02:27:30.181
<v Speaker 2>seasonal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe in the martian winter they </v>

3000
02:27:30.181 --> 02:27:30.181
<v Speaker 2>moved down to the equator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me back up again in the summer.</v>

3001
02:27:30.181 --> 02:27:34.260
<v Speaker 2>Didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then we proved that they were indeed </v>

3002
02:27:34.260 --> 02:27:36.751
<v Speaker 2>seasonal by getting millions of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who watched the program to go look at </v>

3003
02:27:36.751 --> 02:27:40.861
<v Speaker 2>the pictures for the first time so you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can go online now and look at pictures </v>

3004
02:27:40.861 --> 02:27:44.611
<v Speaker 2>of mars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's saY that nobody's ever seen it </v>

3005
02:27:44.611 --> 02:27:46.120
<v Speaker 2>because it's too much data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the of the planet,</v>

3006
02:27:46.420 --> 02:27:50.170
<v Speaker 2>so imagine the amount of data generated </v>
<v Speaker 2>on this planet that no one's ever done,</v>

3007
02:27:50.560 --> 02:27:55.560
<v Speaker 2>that no one's ever looked at this date.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll be data about what a increases </v>

3008
02:27:55.560 --> 02:27:57.280
<v Speaker 2>the likelihood of certain cancers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

3009
02:27:57.370 --> 02:28:02.370
<v Speaker 2>there'll be the lifestyle that does that</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't engender that alone will be </v>

3010
02:28:02.370 --> 02:28:04.750
<v Speaker 2>there in the data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no one's quite got their head around</v>

3011
02:28:04.751 --> 02:28:08.410
<v Speaker 2>now to go and mine that data and try to </v>
<v Speaker 2>use it.</v>

3012
02:28:08.460 --> 02:28:13.460
<v Speaker 2>It just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Using the data is extremely difficult </v>

3013
02:28:13.460 --> 02:28:13.460
<v Speaker 2>and challenging,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're right,</v>

3014
02:28:13.460 --> 02:28:17.701
<v Speaker 2>it's there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one ever looks at it will not only </v>

3015
02:28:17.701 --> 02:28:20.791
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of somehow or another </v>

3016
02:28:20.791 --> 02:28:22.300
<v Speaker 2>preserving this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there was some event super volcano</v>

3017
02:28:22.300 --> 02:28:27.300
<v Speaker 3>eruption,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like they're constantly worried about </v>

3018
02:28:27.300 --> 02:28:27.300
<v Speaker 3>yellowstone and there's one in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Indonesia,</v>

3019
02:28:27.300 --> 02:28:29.810
<v Speaker 3>I believe it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they believe is connected to a mass</v>

3020
02:28:29.811 --> 02:28:33.020
<v Speaker 3>extinction event that killed off a giant</v>
<v Speaker 3>swath of the population.</v>

3021
02:28:33.060 --> 02:28:33.750
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're nasty.</v>

3022
02:28:33.760 --> 02:28:37.670
<v Speaker 3>They're the super volcanoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Terrifying one of those to go and if one</v>

3023
02:28:37.671 --> 02:28:42.671
<v Speaker 3>of those hits and somehow or another,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the power goes out all around the world </v>

3024
02:28:42.671 --> 02:28:45.080
<v Speaker 3>and the only people that survive are </v>
<v Speaker 3>those folks that live by the volcano.</v>

3025
02:28:45.410 --> 02:28:48.050
<v Speaker 3>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're starting from scratch.</v>

3026
02:28:48.260 --> 02:28:51.050
<v Speaker 3>Like I mean relatively in terms of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe.</v>

3027
02:28:51.051 --> 02:28:53.270
<v Speaker 3>That's nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you big baby.</v>

3028
02:28:53.390 --> 02:28:58.390
<v Speaker 3>You got to wait another 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>years civilization to reemerge and </v>

3029
02:28:58.390 --> 02:28:59.970
<v Speaker 3>someone to reinvent the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3030
02:28:59.990 --> 02:29:04.990
<v Speaker 3>and the ark of the covenant and still </v>
<v Speaker 3>locked up in Ethiopia because they </v>

3031
02:29:04.990 --> 02:29:08.231
<v Speaker 3>already did this and they already </v>
<v Speaker 3>figured out how to make nuclear bomb or </v>

3032
02:29:08.231 --> 02:29:08.231
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

3033
02:29:08.231 --> 02:29:08.490
<v Speaker 3>When those the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the,</v>

3034
02:29:08.580 --> 02:29:09.350
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

3035
02:29:09.620 --> 02:29:14.620
<v Speaker 3>For our immediate life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so critical to not just acquire </v>

3036
02:29:14.620 --> 02:29:16.310
<v Speaker 3>this information,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but to nurture it and to spread it.</v>

3037
02:29:16.311 --> 02:29:17.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's your whole idea,</v>

3038
02:29:17.391 --> 02:29:17.670
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

3039
02:29:17.760 --> 02:29:21.740
<v Speaker 3>you're just talking about expanding </v>
<v Speaker 3>science and education and getting people</v>

3040
02:29:21.741 --> 02:29:24.650
<v Speaker 3>excited and involved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean jack shit.</v>

3041
02:29:24.651 --> 02:29:29.651
<v Speaker 3>If The fucking earth spits out a giant </v>
<v Speaker 3>ball of lava that engulfs half of north </v>

3042
02:29:29.651 --> 02:29:32.030
<v Speaker 3>America and that kills 90 percent of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>planet,</v>

3043
02:29:32.210 --> 02:29:34.640
<v Speaker 3>like we're starting from scratch and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not.</v>

3044
02:29:34.670 --> 02:29:37.070
<v Speaker 3>None of this is going to be any good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No computers,</v>

3045
02:29:37.071 --> 02:29:38.750
<v Speaker 3>no hard drives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no flash drives,</v>

3046
02:29:38.751 --> 02:29:40.580
<v Speaker 3>no fucking database.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all bullshit.</v>

3047
02:29:40.581 --> 02:29:43.190
<v Speaker 3>The cloud go fuck your cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not really in the cloud.</v>

3048
02:29:43.310 --> 02:29:45.530
<v Speaker 3>I've got news for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's down on earth and oh,</v>

3049
02:29:45.680 --> 02:29:46.490
<v Speaker 3>it's in the cloud.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3050
02:29:46.491 --> 02:29:47.810
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no cloud.</v>

3051
02:29:47.960 --> 02:29:49.340
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't exist.</v>

3052
02:29:49.400 --> 02:29:51.470
<v Speaker 3>You go up and look around for your </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking data.</v>

3053
02:29:51.500 --> 02:29:54.780
<v Speaker 3>It's not there in someone's goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 3>building.</v>

3054
02:29:54.930 --> 02:29:56.540
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a fucking building.</v>

3055
02:29:56.690 --> 02:30:00.050
<v Speaker 3>Stop saying it's in the cloud because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not a dirty,</v>

3056
02:30:00.051 --> 02:30:00.920
<v Speaker 3>stinky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>live.</v>

3057
02:30:03.170 --> 02:30:08.170
<v Speaker 3>That's reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unless you're launching that fucking </v>

3058
02:30:08.170 --> 02:30:11.231
<v Speaker 3>shit up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would have taken all the hard drives </v>

3059
02:30:11.231 --> 02:30:11.840
<v Speaker 3>of all the world and launching it into </v>
<v Speaker 3>space and you know,</v>

3060
02:30:11.910 --> 02:30:13.640
<v Speaker 3>on a 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>year loop.</v>

3061
02:30:13.760 --> 02:30:16.300
<v Speaker 3>So it comes back around and lands to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3062
02:30:16.470 --> 02:30:21.470
<v Speaker 3>you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>90 nine point nine percent of the speed </v>

3063
02:30:21.470 --> 02:30:21.610
<v Speaker 3>of light.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the data you're getting back again,</v>

3064
02:30:22.070 --> 02:30:27.070
<v Speaker 3>it comes back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could you imagine if that's what happens</v>

3065
02:30:28.491 --> 02:30:32.630
<v Speaker 3>like one day just they do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they pick a strategic location that they</v>

3066
02:30:32.631 --> 02:30:36.680
<v Speaker 3>believe will be a large population of </v>
<v Speaker 3>life and it really lands 10,000</v>

3067
02:30:36.681 --> 02:30:38.750
<v Speaker 3>years later and we go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh fuck,</v>

3068
02:30:38.780 --> 02:30:43.780
<v Speaker 3>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at all the shIt they knew and it's </v>

3069
02:30:43.780 --> 02:30:46.270
<v Speaker 3>all in dos or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some something that we could read like </v>

3070
02:30:46.270 --> 02:30:49.600
<v Speaker 3>fairly easily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They run it through some computers and </v>

3071
02:30:49.600 --> 02:30:49.600
<v Speaker 3>they realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

3072
02:30:49.600 --> 02:30:50.000
<v Speaker 3>fucking people been around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember my first,</v>

3073
02:30:50.001 --> 02:30:51.550
<v Speaker 3>my first operating system on a pc?</v>

3074
02:30:51.550 --> 02:30:55.360
<v Speaker 3>There's dust five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember that I was postdoc.</v>

3075
02:30:56.130 --> 02:31:01.130
<v Speaker 3>The first computer that I ever had had </v>
<v Speaker 3>windows 95 and windows 95 was the big </v>

3076
02:31:01.551 --> 02:31:06.551
<v Speaker 3>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend chris made computers with </v>

3077
02:31:06.551 --> 02:31:09.110
<v Speaker 3>windows three point two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three point one when she ran on dust.</v>

3078
02:31:09.120 --> 02:31:09.590
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

3079
02:31:09.591 --> 02:31:14.591
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had no windows when I first got my </v>

3080
02:31:14.591 --> 02:31:14.591
<v Speaker 3>first pc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3081
02:31:14.591 --> 02:31:14.591
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

3082
02:31:14.660 --> 02:31:19.660
<v Speaker 3>And if you think about how recent you </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of guy named matt on that.</v>

3083
02:31:21.750 --> 02:31:22.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3084
02:31:22.410 --> 02:31:24.540
<v Speaker 3>If someone sends you a picture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's way bigger than that.</v>

3085
02:31:25.030 --> 02:31:26.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every fucking pictures.</v>

3086
02:31:26.191 --> 02:31:27.110
<v Speaker 3>100 million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3087
02:31:27.590 --> 02:31:32.590
<v Speaker 3>And if you think that that was 1995,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was only 20 years ago and in 20 years</v>

3088
02:31:34.080 --> 02:31:36.250
<v Speaker 3>a blink of an eye,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3089
02:31:36.960 --> 02:31:41.960
<v Speaker 3>a blink of an eye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we should get back to dos you </v>

3090
02:31:41.960 --> 02:31:41.960
<v Speaker 3>think?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3091
02:31:41.960 --> 02:31:46.190
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because you want to know that it </v>

3092
02:31:46.190 --> 02:31:46.190
<v Speaker 3>competes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It worked.</v>

3093
02:31:46.190 --> 02:31:50.020
<v Speaker 3>You got to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to have these little also exec </v>

3094
02:31:50.020 --> 02:31:50.590
<v Speaker 3>that files that designed the memory of.</v>

3095
02:31:50.620 --> 02:31:52.930
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that like more work than you need,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

3096
02:31:53.120 --> 02:31:54.560
<v Speaker 3>It's a big deal in the sentence because </v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

3097
02:31:54.610 --> 02:31:59.610
<v Speaker 3>we have a problem with getting kids to </v>
<v Speaker 3>write code because they'll think it's a </v>

3098
02:31:59.971 --> 02:32:01.680
<v Speaker 3>lot of work to write code,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3099
02:32:01.770 --> 02:32:06.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like in the old days with the </v>

3100
02:32:06.770 --> 02:32:08.151
<v Speaker 3>computers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have friends that make video games </v>

3101
02:32:08.151 --> 02:32:10.140
<v Speaker 3>and one of the most shocking things was </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3102
02:32:10.141 --> 02:32:14.520
<v Speaker 3>the sheer amount of hours that go into </v>
<v Speaker 3>coding video games.</v>

3103
02:32:14.880 --> 02:32:16.950
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the folks at id software,</v>

3104
02:32:16.951 --> 02:32:20.090
<v Speaker 3>they let me in behind the scenes and </v>
<v Speaker 3>epic games to cliff.</v>

3105
02:32:20.110 --> 02:32:25.110
<v Speaker 3>He be our friend cliff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was on the podcast before I would </v>

3106
02:32:25.110 --> 02:32:28.491
<v Speaker 3>watch those guys work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They would do 16 hour days and they </v>

3107
02:32:28.491 --> 02:32:32.031
<v Speaker 3>would just be coding and drinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking caffeine and just staring in </v>

3108
02:32:32.031 --> 02:32:35.580
<v Speaker 3>front of these monitors and just running</v>
<v Speaker 3>over thousands of lines of code.</v>

3109
02:32:35.581 --> 02:32:36.720
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3110
02:32:36.930 --> 02:32:38.820
<v Speaker 3>that's how you make a fucking video </v>
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>

3111
02:32:39.100 --> 02:32:42.560
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of 100 million dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things are unbelievable.</v>

3112
02:32:42.561 --> 02:32:43.620
<v Speaker 3>They like movies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3113
02:32:43.980 --> 02:32:47.540
<v Speaker 3>they're bigger than movies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The average huge gambling,</v>

3114
02:32:47.541 --> 02:32:48.780
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grand theft auto.</v>

3115
02:32:48.930 --> 02:32:52.010
<v Speaker 3>When those games get released,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're there.</v>

3116
02:32:52.050 --> 02:32:55.650
<v Speaker 3>The amount of money that they generate </v>
<v Speaker 3>Is rival to like avatar.</v>

3117
02:32:55.651 --> 02:32:59.850
<v Speaker 3>Some huge spectacular hit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like not an average movie,</v>

3118
02:32:59.851 --> 02:33:02.220
<v Speaker 3>but it just gigantic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>monumental,</v>

3119
02:33:02.280 --> 02:33:07.280
<v Speaker 3>epic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>huge successful movie that's like an </v>

3120
02:33:07.280 --> 02:33:09.630
<v Speaker 3>average video game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Grand theft auto and madden.</v>

3121
02:33:09.631 --> 02:33:12.870
<v Speaker 3>When those madden games come out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fucking world changes.</v>

3122
02:33:12.871 --> 02:33:17.871
<v Speaker 3>Like I mean people generally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's so much income that gets poured </v>

3123
02:33:17.871 --> 02:33:21.231
<v Speaker 3>into those video games and you realize </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's a lot of just people just </v>

3124
02:33:21.231 --> 02:33:23.991
<v Speaker 3>coding because standing in front of </v>
<v Speaker 3>computers and just pounding on a </v>

3125
02:33:23.991 --> 02:33:24.720
<v Speaker 3>keyboard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's madness.</v>

3126
02:33:25.180 --> 02:33:30.180
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe that's the way that western </v>

3127
02:33:30.180 --> 02:33:30.180
<v Speaker 3>civilization falls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The coders stopped,</v>

3128
02:33:30.180 --> 02:33:32.970
<v Speaker 3>people stopped fucking going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to stop breeding.</v>

3129
02:33:33.270 --> 02:33:34.110
<v Speaker 3>That's just gonna happen.</v>

3130
02:33:34.590 --> 02:33:39.590
<v Speaker 3>Women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Women will stop having sex with motors </v>

3131
02:33:39.590 --> 02:33:41.040
<v Speaker 3>and it's all going to fucking end all </v>
<v Speaker 3>their accumulated knowledge that we were</v>

3132
02:33:41.041 --> 02:33:44.220
<v Speaker 3>talking about before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the coders making children that are</v>

3133
02:33:44.221 --> 02:33:45.570
<v Speaker 3>better coders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>

3134
02:33:45.810 --> 02:33:49.080
<v Speaker 3>Just ends one day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe you can wrIte four tran.</v>

3135
02:33:49.440 --> 02:33:54.440
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One day we wake up and we realized that </v>

3136
02:33:54.440 --> 02:33:55.200
<v Speaker 3>no one's making video games anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we go to these places where they made</v>

3137
02:33:55.201 --> 02:33:55.950
<v Speaker 3>video games.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like,</v>

3138
02:33:55.951 --> 02:33:58.710
<v Speaker 3>hello,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's dead cobwebs everywhere.</v>

3139
02:33:59.400 --> 02:34:01.730
<v Speaker 3>They just died and no one fucked up the </v>
<v Speaker 3>apocalypse.</v>

3140
02:34:02.940 --> 02:34:04.260
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3141
02:34:04.290 --> 02:34:09.290
<v Speaker 3>imagine if computer coders ceased to </v>
<v Speaker 3>exist and all of us were forced to back </v>

3142
02:34:10.291 --> 02:34:14.550
<v Speaker 3>engineer computer code if today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like for somehow or another,</v>

3143
02:34:14.551 --> 02:34:19.551
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how many people in this </v>
<v Speaker 3>world have a deep understanding of </v>

3144
02:34:19.551 --> 02:34:21.430
<v Speaker 3>computer operating systems or computer </v>
<v Speaker 3>code,</v>

3145
02:34:21.550 --> 02:34:26.550
<v Speaker 3>but I couldn't imagine it's more than </v>
<v Speaker 3>one percent and if we lost one percent </v>

3146
02:34:26.550 --> 02:34:27.820
<v Speaker 3>of the population just disappeared from </v>
<v Speaker 3>the earth.</v>

3147
02:34:28.030 --> 02:34:33.030
<v Speaker 3>And then the rest of us dopes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're left to observe our cell phone </v>

3148
02:34:33.030 --> 02:34:35.170
<v Speaker 3>crashing or fucking tri caster over </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

3149
02:34:35.350 --> 02:34:40.350
<v Speaker 3>That shit the bed on us mid broadcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if that's a critical part of our,</v>

3150
02:34:42.370 --> 02:34:46.870
<v Speaker 3>our society of civilization itself and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it totally overlooked.</v>

3151
02:34:46.990 --> 02:34:49.840
<v Speaker 3>So you coders out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>god bless,</v>

3152
02:34:50.160 --> 02:34:52.000
<v Speaker 3>keep breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep breathing,</v>

3153
02:34:52.040 --> 02:34:57.040
<v Speaker 3>and breathing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Breathing and breathing with the praise </v>

3154
02:34:57.260 --> 02:34:58.600
<v Speaker 3>odin for the coders.</v>

3155
02:35:00.910 --> 02:35:02.780
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so amazing.</v>

3156
02:35:02.830 --> 02:35:07.830
<v Speaker 3>If you really think of how much our life</v>
<v Speaker 3>in our civilization revolves around </v>

3157
02:35:08.170 --> 02:35:12.700
<v Speaker 3>electronics and around computer code,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which you a monkey cage and essentially,</v>

3158
02:35:12.701 --> 02:35:14.920
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's stunning.</v>

3159
02:35:15.130 --> 02:35:20.130
<v Speaker 3>If you really stop and think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every single thing that used to be </v>

3160
02:35:20.130 --> 02:35:24.180
<v Speaker 3>mechanical and a and an analog is now </v>
<v Speaker 3>computer like cars.</v>

3161
02:35:24.640 --> 02:35:29.640
<v Speaker 3>ThIs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the main for car enthusiasts is one of </v>

3162
02:35:29.640 --> 02:35:30.880
<v Speaker 3>the main complaints is that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel what a car is doing anymore.</v>

3163
02:35:31.030 --> 02:35:35.470
<v Speaker 3>One of the thrIlls of driving an older </v>
<v Speaker 3>car like especially in old sports car,</v>

3164
02:35:35.471 --> 02:35:37.270
<v Speaker 3>they're not as fast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't handle as well,</v>

3165
02:35:37.450 --> 02:35:42.190
<v Speaker 3>but you feel everything you feel the </v>
<v Speaker 3>road because it's a mechanical steering.</v>

3166
02:35:42.191 --> 02:35:47.191
<v Speaker 3>There's no assisting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you go to like a 1973 porsche </v>

3167
02:35:47.191 --> 02:35:47.800
<v Speaker 3>nine slash 11,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no.</v>

3168
02:35:47.950 --> 02:35:50.110
<v Speaker 3>There's no hydraulic assist in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>steering.</v>

3169
02:35:50.230 --> 02:35:52.360
<v Speaker 3>It's all mechanical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel every pebble.</v>

3170
02:35:52.450 --> 02:35:56.200
<v Speaker 3>You literally feel the mechanism turning</v>
<v Speaker 3>the tire.</v>

3171
02:35:56.201 --> 02:36:01.201
<v Speaker 3>You feel the tires losing their grip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all transmitted through your seat </v>

3172
02:36:01.201 --> 02:36:01.990
<v Speaker 3>and through your hands and people live </v>
<v Speaker 3>for this.</v>

3173
02:36:01.991 --> 02:36:05.380
<v Speaker 3>It's like exciting stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you drive a modern porsche,</v>

3174
02:36:05.710 --> 02:36:10.710
<v Speaker 3>it's like there's a million operations </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are going on behind the scenes and </v>

3175
02:36:10.710 --> 02:36:14.551
<v Speaker 3>every second to avoid collisions and </v>
<v Speaker 3>slow your tires down and breaking on the</v>

3176
02:36:14.711 --> 02:36:16.530
<v Speaker 3>right side because you're turning left.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3177
02:36:16.540 --> 02:36:18.820
<v Speaker 3>all this shit that's going on that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't even know.</v>

3178
02:36:18.850 --> 02:36:23.850
<v Speaker 3>You don't even feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a magnetic ride control system </v>

3179
02:36:23.850 --> 02:36:25.000
<v Speaker 3>that's adjusting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's like there's certain cars now,</v>

3180
02:36:25.120 --> 02:36:30.120
<v Speaker 3>like I believe mercedes benz has a </v>
<v Speaker 3>camera that looks at the road in front </v>

3181
02:36:30.161 --> 02:36:34.570
<v Speaker 3>of you and gauges whether or not the </v>
<v Speaker 3>suspension should be compliant or rigid.</v>

3182
02:36:34.870 --> 02:36:38.650
<v Speaker 3>It adjusts and you can go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think up to like 30 miles an hour.</v>

3183
02:36:38.770 --> 02:36:42.160
<v Speaker 3>You just take your hand off the wheel </v>
<v Speaker 3>and put it in cruise control and fucking</v>

3184
02:36:42.161 --> 02:36:47.161
<v Speaker 3>turns based on the lines on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that said that the first </v>

3185
02:36:47.161 --> 02:36:49.890
<v Speaker 3>sentence being is going to be a nine </v>
<v Speaker 3>slash 1117?</v>

3186
02:36:51.280 --> 02:36:56.280
<v Speaker 3>I hope it's an american car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hope it's corvette or maybe perhaps a </v>

3187
02:36:56.280 --> 02:36:58.951
<v Speaker 3>truck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe an f150 takes out godless </v>

3188
02:36:58.951 --> 02:36:59.890
<v Speaker 3>heathens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just drives around,</v>

3189
02:37:00.110 --> 02:37:01.330
<v Speaker 3>eats assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3190
02:37:01.410 --> 02:37:02.440
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder,</v>

3191
02:37:02.500 --> 02:37:03.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3192
02:37:03.011 --> 02:37:08.011
<v Speaker 3>I think for sure if we can live you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm 47,</v>

3193
02:37:08.140 --> 02:37:09.120
<v Speaker 3>how old are you?</v>
<v Speaker 3>40 seven.</v>

3194
02:37:09.220 --> 02:37:12.280
<v Speaker 3>40 seven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if we could live another,</v>

3195
02:37:12.370 --> 02:37:16.700
<v Speaker 3>if we get really lucky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we live another 50 years based on modern</v>

3196
02:37:16.760 --> 02:37:19.700
<v Speaker 3>interpretation of science and medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually 46 by the way,</v>

3197
02:37:19.740 --> 02:37:22.920
<v Speaker 3>hopefully 70 march just because now got </v>
<v Speaker 3>lexus open.</v>

3198
02:37:23.160 --> 02:37:28.160
<v Speaker 3>Get at least you added the right way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know if you like.</v>

3199
02:37:28.521 --> 02:37:29.480
<v Speaker 3>I'm 40 ish.</v>

3200

<v Speaker 3>I have a friend who won't tell me his </v>
<v Speaker 3>age in edwards.</v>

3201
02:37:31.880 --> 02:37:33.770
<v Speaker 3>He won't tell me how old he is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A motherfucker.</v>

3202

<v Speaker 3>I think he's my age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he won't say it.</v>

3203
02:37:38.170 --> 02:37:43.170
<v Speaker 3>I should.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should've said 47 because then we </v>

3204
02:37:43.170 --> 02:37:43.170
<v Speaker 3>could pay the real change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 3>If you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If,</v>

3209
02:37:49.810 --> 02:37:54.810
<v Speaker 3>if you consider this idea that we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we everything goes correct and we </v>

3210

<v Speaker 3>the exponential increase in technology,</v>

3216
02:38:17.391 --> 02:38:22.391

<v Speaker 2>Can't remember when,</v>

<v Speaker 2>these elan musk type guy guys.</v>

<v Speaker 2>he's built one of these things and he </v>

3236

<v Speaker 2>gets one of his employees to come and do</v>
<v Speaker 2>a turing test on it,</v>

3237
02:39:03.420 --> 02:39:06.830
<v Speaker 2>which is to see if he thinks that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing has sentience,</v>

3238
02:39:06.860 --> 02:39:11.860
<v Speaker 2>this ai.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But she's beautiful and it kind of goes </v>

3239
02:39:11.860 --> 02:39:12.920
<v Speaker 2>off from there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But alex wrote the beach and he wrote 28</v>

3240
02:39:12.921 --> 02:39:13.520
<v Speaker 2>days later</v>

3241
02:39:14.560 --> 02:39:14.980
<v Speaker 3>say</v>

3242
02:39:15.460 --> 02:39:18.100
<v Speaker 2>really brilliant science fiction film,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>

3243
02:39:18.220 --> 02:39:23.220
<v Speaker 2>it is slow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of these issues that we've been </v>

3244
02:39:23.220 --> 02:39:23.220
<v Speaker 2>talking about about what it is to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>human,</v>

3245
02:39:23.220 --> 02:39:27.061
<v Speaker 2>are the ais bathers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are they better than it was morally </v>

3246
02:39:27.061 --> 02:39:27.380
<v Speaker 2>physically strange?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it that.</v>

3247
02:39:27.750 --> 02:39:30.640
<v Speaker 2>Why is this girl so beautiful white </v>
<v Speaker 2>wine?</v>

3248
02:39:30.641 --> 02:39:32.950
<v Speaker 2>Did he make this beautiful woman?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

3249
02:39:32.951 --> 02:39:37.951
<v Speaker 2>it's a great film.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I recommend that to everyone who's </v>

3250
02:39:37.951 --> 02:39:37.951
<v Speaker 2>listening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sounds amazing.</v>

3251
02:39:37.951 --> 02:39:39.790
<v Speaker 2>when is it going to be released here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It must be very soon because it's been.</v>

3252
02:39:39.791 --> 02:39:41.290
<v Speaker 2>It's just been out in the uk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did very well.</v>

3253
02:39:42.070 --> 02:39:47.070
<v Speaker 3>Is it going to be released in theaters </v>
<v Speaker 3>or is a digital release April 10th in </v>

3254
02:39:47.070 --> 02:39:47.270
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you'd.</v>

3255
02:39:48.310 --> 02:39:49.180
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that sounds.</v>

3256
02:39:49.181 --> 02:39:50.370
<v Speaker 3>That's a great concept.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3257
02:39:50.630 --> 02:39:52.720
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've said for a long time,</v>

3258
02:39:52.721 --> 02:39:55.780
<v Speaker 3>but I believe the first artificial </v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence be sex slaves.</v>

3259
02:39:56.110 --> 02:39:57.790
<v Speaker 3>People are going to make artificial </v>
<v Speaker 3>sucks.</v>

3260
02:39:57.791 --> 02:40:02.791
<v Speaker 3>People.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People that are going to have sex with </v>

3261
02:40:02.791 --> 02:40:03.730
<v Speaker 3>like is it cheating to use a device?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it cheating to masturbate?</v>

3262
02:40:03.731 --> 02:40:06.520
<v Speaker 3>Some people say yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was reading a forum article was people</v>

3263
02:40:06.940 --> 02:40:11.940
<v Speaker 3>arguing as guys arguing with his wife.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's saying if he doesn't stop </v>

3264
02:40:11.940 --> 02:40:14.851
<v Speaker 3>masturbating,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's going to divorce him specifically </v>

3265
02:40:14.851 --> 02:40:14.851
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3266
02:40:14.851 --> 02:40:17.950
<v Speaker 4>augie with his hand and say he ended the</v>
<v Speaker 4>insightful advice.</v>

3267
02:40:18.110 --> 02:40:20.250
<v Speaker 4>Seven faithfulness just beat his hand </v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

3268
02:40:20.870 --> 02:40:22.590
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then,</v>

3269
02:40:22.650 --> 02:40:27.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it goes from masturbation to </v>

3270
02:40:27.650 --> 02:40:30.800
<v Speaker 4>masturbation using technology and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>internet to watch pornography to </v>

3271
02:40:30.800 --> 02:40:32.420
<v Speaker 4>masturbation using a device.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they have these,</v>

3272
02:40:32.421 --> 02:40:32.880
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3273
02:40:32.881 --> 02:40:34.190

<v Speaker 4>I'm sure.</v>

3274
02:40:34.200 --> 02:40:35.850
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's good.</v>

3275
02:40:35.920 --> 02:40:38.880
<v Speaker 4>I should go with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The new version of it.</v>

3276
02:40:39.180 --> 02:40:42.720
<v Speaker 4>My friend duncan called me up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was at the improv and when,</v>

3277
02:40:43.110 --> 02:40:44.730

3278
02:40:44.731 --> 02:40:49.731
<v Speaker 4>I was about to go onstage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like five minutes for I go on </v>

3279

<v Speaker 4>three d virtual reality conference and </v>

<v Speaker 4>It's a fucking game changer,</v>

3281
02:40:55.321 --> 02:40:56.610
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is the craziest shit.</v>

3282
02:40:56.611 --> 02:41:00.510
<v Speaker 4>I said that it was the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hd quaLity was stunning.</v>

3283
02:41:00.540 --> 02:41:04.010
<v Speaker 4>I did 70.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me have a look at the one that we,</v>

3284
02:41:04.030 --> 02:41:05.190
<v Speaker 4>there's an oculus and something else.</v>

3285
02:41:05.190 --> 02:41:06.900
<v Speaker 4>They use them for the past four,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is not going.</v>

3286
02:41:06.960 --> 02:41:08.460
<v Speaker 4>It's not out yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We did it in 12 months.</v>

3287
02:41:08.461 --> 02:41:09.270
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something like that.</v>

3288
02:41:09.810 --> 02:41:14.400
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing that they showed me this </v>
<v Speaker 4>demo and it's a real.</v>

3289
02:41:14.850 --> 02:41:17.150
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very,</v>

3290
02:41:17.151 --> 02:41:22.151
<v Speaker 4>very good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that is going to be a game </v>

3291
02:41:22.151 --> 02:41:22.151
<v Speaker 4>changer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3292
02:41:22.151 --> 02:41:24.511
<v Speaker 4>they decided to do first person </v>
<v Speaker 4>pornography with these things that </v>

3293
02:41:24.511 --> 02:41:26.100
<v Speaker 4>supposed to just be like there was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>real issue that people are going to have</v>

3294
02:41:26.101 --> 02:41:30.390
<v Speaker 4>with being addicted to this stuff </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I don't believe that our minds.</v>

3295
02:41:30.391 --> 02:41:35.391
<v Speaker 4>I think one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the reasons why people have such </v>

3296
02:41:35.391 --> 02:41:36.150
<v Speaker 4>a deep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what we were talking about earlier,</v>

3297
02:41:36.200 --> 02:41:41.200
<v Speaker 4>that people get angry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a dumb programming and people get angry </v>

3298
02:41:41.200 --> 02:41:41.200
<v Speaker 4>at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3299
02:41:41.200 --> 02:41:45.620
<v Speaker 4>dumb songs and dump television shows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the reasons I think we have this </v>

3300
02:41:46.020 --> 02:41:48.330
<v Speaker 4>instinct to get upset at it is we.</v>

3301
02:41:48.420 --> 02:41:53.420
<v Speaker 4>I think we inherently understand that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not designed to process the media </v>

3302
02:41:54.391 --> 02:41:57.540
<v Speaker 4>that we've created.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're designed to imitate the successful</v>

3303
02:41:57.541 --> 02:42:02.541
<v Speaker 4>behaviors or other tribal members.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were designed to listen to people </v>

3304
02:42:02.541 --> 02:42:03.330
<v Speaker 4>like you talk and be inspired,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you're right here.</v>

3305
02:42:03.331 --> 02:42:04.760
<v Speaker 4>I'm looking right at you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It evolved,</v>

3306
02:42:04.830 --> 02:42:05.570
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not,</v>

3307
02:42:05.590 --> 02:42:06.400
<v Speaker 4>you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3308
02:42:06.480 --> 02:42:11.480
<v Speaker 4>I don't mean it in that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean in a sense of how we function </v>

3309
02:42:11.480 --> 02:42:11.730
<v Speaker 4>evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry,</v>

3310
02:42:11.790 --> 02:42:14.520
<v Speaker 4>I don't mean design,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you,</v>

3311
02:42:14.680 --> 02:42:17.290
<v Speaker 4>if you take that into consideration,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

3312
02:42:17.360 --> 02:42:17.750
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3313
02:42:17.780 --> 02:42:22.780
<v Speaker 4>what about a screen that's 60 feet tall </v>
<v Speaker 4>and brad pitt comes on and his bone </v>

3314
02:42:23.131 --> 02:42:24.870
<v Speaker 4>structure is fucking perfect and if it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

3315
02:42:24.871 --> 02:42:29.871
<v Speaker 4>they manipulate it and make it perfect </v>
<v Speaker 4>with three g cgi and every time he talks</v>

3316
02:42:30.270 --> 02:42:33.720
<v Speaker 4>music's playing and every word out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>his mouth is carefully considered.</v>

3317
02:42:33.721 --> 02:42:35.820
<v Speaker 4>Although It looks spontaneous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not.</v>

3318
02:42:36.060 --> 02:42:41.060
<v Speaker 4>They've carefully considered this for </v>
<v Speaker 4>weeks and weeks for maximum impact on </v>

3319
02:42:41.060 --> 02:42:44.601
<v Speaker 4>your psyche and your sitting there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the music's playing and he kisses </v>

3320
02:42:44.601 --> 02:42:46.740
<v Speaker 4>angelina jolie and oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we're not designed for that.</v>

3321
02:42:46.860 --> 02:42:49.740
<v Speaker 4>So our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our very exisTence,</v>

3322
02:42:49.741 --> 02:42:54.741
<v Speaker 4>the world that we live in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our model of it is based like ninetY </v>

3323
02:42:54.741 --> 02:42:57.570
<v Speaker 4>percent on bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ten percent of real life experiences,</v>

3324
02:42:57.720 --> 02:43:02.720
<v Speaker 4>90 percent on movies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I have a friend who got in a fight </v>

3325
02:43:02.720 --> 02:43:07.011
<v Speaker 4>with a guy and the guy said to him while</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're about to fight some drunken </v>

3326
02:43:07.011 --> 02:43:09.150
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>prepare to dine in hell tonight.</v>

3327
02:43:09.151 --> 02:43:12.010
<v Speaker 4>We dine in hell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He yelled out a fucking quote</v>

3328
02:43:12.010 --> 02:43:15.070
<v Speaker 3>from a stupid movie when they were about</v>
<v Speaker 3>to fist fight.</v>

3329
02:43:15.370 --> 02:43:16.530
<v Speaker 3>They were fist fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

3330
02:43:16.660 --> 02:43:18.580
<v Speaker 3>which could potentially leave it lead to</v>
<v Speaker 3>death.</v>

3331
02:43:18.581 --> 02:43:23.581
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're involved in like actively </v>

3332
02:43:23.581 --> 02:43:24.280
<v Speaker 3>trying to hurt another human being,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all fucking bets are out the window.</v>

3333
02:43:24.630 --> 02:43:25.900
<v Speaker 3>This is chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3334
02:43:26.290 --> 02:43:28.540
<v Speaker 3>And the guy's yelling at a movie quote </v>
<v Speaker 3>tonight.</v>

3335
02:43:28.541 --> 02:43:33.370
<v Speaker 3>We dine in the beginning of a beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 3>friendship.</v>

3336
02:43:33.500 --> 02:43:38.500
<v Speaker 3>We're just randomly sharing quotes back </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the grid.</v>

3337
02:43:40.400 --> 02:43:44.690
<v Speaker 3>We're off to see the wiz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

3338
02:43:46.090 --> 02:43:49.750

<v Speaker 3>My brother were crazy.</v>

3339
02:43:50.050 --> 02:43:53.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't think the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the inspiration that I get from songs,</v>

3340
02:43:53.691 --> 02:43:56.080
<v Speaker 3>like there's songs that I'll listen to,</v>

3344
02:43:59.951 --> 02:44:01.420
<v Speaker 3>When you live,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen to those songs,</v>

3345
02:44:01.540 --> 02:44:04.210
<v Speaker 3>you can lift more weights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can work out harder.</v>

3346
02:44:04.300 --> 02:44:05.710
<v Speaker 3>Like you're tired,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're on the elliptical.</v>

3347
02:44:05.711 --> 02:44:10.711
<v Speaker 3>Machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Queen comes on like dragon attack and </v>

3348
02:44:10.711 --> 02:44:10.711
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

3349
02:44:10.711 --> 02:44:11.950
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body reacts to it.</v>

3350
02:44:11.950 --> 02:44:16.950
<v Speaker 3>You have a physiological response to </v>
<v Speaker 3>media is something that's been created </v>

3351
02:44:16.950 --> 02:44:19.090
<v Speaker 3>that doesn't exist in nature with all of</v>
<v Speaker 3>nature's majesty,</v>

3352
02:44:19.270 --> 02:44:24.270
<v Speaker 3>with fucking waterfalls and flowers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It never figured out how to make sound </v>

3353
02:44:24.270 --> 02:44:26.890
<v Speaker 3>come out of a headset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just incredible.</v>

3354
02:44:26.990 --> 02:44:28.020
<v Speaker 3>It just makes your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

3355
02:44:28.021 --> 02:44:28.480
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>

<v Speaker 3>your fucking goosebumps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Raise up.</v>

3357
02:44:30.640 --> 02:44:33.850
<v Speaker 3>We've created some weird shit and in </v>
<v Speaker 3>creating that weird shit,</v>

3358
02:44:33.851 --> 02:44:38.851
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're altering our very version of the </v>

3359
02:44:38.851 --> 02:44:40.480
<v Speaker 3>reality that we observe with our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our real senses,</v>

3360
02:44:40.481 --> 02:44:43.690
<v Speaker 3>our eyes and our ears and our fingers </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we're changing it.</v>

3361
02:44:43.691 --> 02:44:48.691
<v Speaker 3>And this oculus rift shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to take it to a whole new </v>

3362
02:44:48.691 --> 02:44:48.691
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3363
02:44:48.691 --> 02:44:50.950
<v Speaker 3>it's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be as addictive as reality</v>

3364
02:44:50.951 --> 02:44:52.480
<v Speaker 3>tv is what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's stupidity.</v>

3365
02:44:52.690 --> 02:44:55.060
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be way more addictive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you could like,</v>

3366
02:44:55.240 --> 02:44:57.370
<v Speaker 3>look at any part of those people while </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're talking,</v>

3367
02:44:57.670 --> 02:44:58.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3368
02:44:58.391 --> 02:45:01.450
<v Speaker 3>you could do whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can move around in their world while</v>

3369
02:45:01.451 --> 02:45:02.560
<v Speaker 3>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while they're existing.</v>

3370
02:45:02.680 --> 02:45:03.580
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to have a real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a real</v>

3371
02:45:03.580 --> 02:45:04.840
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've seen wally.</v>

3372
02:45:05.120 --> 02:45:06.610
<v Speaker 1>I haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wally.</v>

3373
02:45:07.090 --> 02:45:08.680
<v Speaker 1>Wally was a good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3374
02:45:08.681 --> 02:45:10.000
<v Speaker 1>it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a great film,</v>

3375
02:45:10.090 --> 02:45:15.090
<v Speaker 1>but everyone just ends up every human is</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically a fat useless slub that floats</v>

3376
02:45:18.191 --> 02:45:22.530
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can't even walk just on a big space line</v>

3377
02:45:22.600 --> 02:45:25.420
<v Speaker 1>floating around in space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm useless.</v>

3378
02:45:25.510 --> 02:45:27.540
<v Speaker 1>Just gone watching tv.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

3379
02:45:27.541 --> 02:45:30.640
<v Speaker 1>That sort of sped pessimistic version of</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

3380
02:45:31.080 --> 02:45:33.250
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your version of reality?</v>

3381
02:45:33.700 --> 02:45:36.340
<v Speaker 1>This is because we're wrapping up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're running at three hours in when you</v>

3382
02:45:36.370 --> 02:45:39.130
<v Speaker 1>turn into a pumpkin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're right about there.</v>

3383
02:45:39.400 --> 02:45:40.670
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is he,</v>

3384
02:45:40.750 --> 02:45:43.120
<v Speaker 1>what do you think is going to happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>with us?</v>

3385
02:45:43.900 --> 02:45:46.000
<v Speaker 1>Are you pessimistic?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you optimistic?</v>

3386
02:45:46.030 --> 02:45:50.020
<v Speaker 1>Do you enjoy the way the direction we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving ultimately?</v>

3387
02:45:51.490 --> 02:45:52.900
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3388
02:45:53.650 --> 02:45:57.080
<v Speaker 1>our scientific and engineering </v>
<v Speaker 1>achievement.</v>

3389
02:45:57.090 --> 02:46:01.120
<v Speaker 1>So astonishing and going beautifully </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

3390
02:46:01.600 --> 02:46:04.120
<v Speaker 1>I think it needs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>needs.</v>

3391
02:46:04.840 --> 02:46:07.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm optimistic I think,</v>

3392
02:46:07.360 --> 02:46:10.310
<v Speaker 1>but I think it just needs a little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm slightly</v>

3393
02:46:10.310 --> 02:46:14.150
<v Speaker 2>pessimistic at the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it just needs this little nudge.</v>

3394
02:46:14.360 --> 02:46:19.360
<v Speaker 2>I think just a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got the weed in countries like </v>

3395
02:46:19.360 --> 02:46:19.620
<v Speaker 2>ours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3396
02:46:19.680 --> 02:46:24.680
<v Speaker 2>We've got these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these education systems and these </v>

3397
02:46:24.680 --> 02:46:24.680
<v Speaker 2>universities that are broadly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very good.</v>

3398
02:46:24.680 --> 02:46:29.321
<v Speaker 2>They need a bit more money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're pretty good and we've got a </v>

3399
02:46:29.321 --> 02:46:33.790
<v Speaker 2>culture that allows us to be open minded</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we have democracies and all these </v>

3400
02:46:33.790 --> 02:46:37.571
<v Speaker 2>things are very difficult to get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think we often miss the great </v>

3401
02:46:37.571 --> 02:46:39.800
<v Speaker 2>things that we have in place in places </v>
<v Speaker 2>like the us and europe.</v>

3402
02:46:40.160 --> 02:46:42.770
<v Speaker 2>Definitely really very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

3403
02:46:42.810 --> 02:46:47.510
<v Speaker 2>so it just takes a recognition of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what we started again,</v>

3404
02:46:47.511 --> 02:46:52.511
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you just remind people what </v>

3405
02:46:52.511 --> 02:46:52.850
<v Speaker 2>wonderful opportunities they have and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what wonderful things there are to do.</v>

3406
02:46:53.180 --> 02:46:58.180
<v Speaker 2>And he just turned the reality tv off </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a bit and go and read a book or </v>

3407
02:46:58.411 --> 02:47:00.530
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a kindle book.</v>

3408
02:47:00.610 --> 02:47:03.920
<v Speaker 2>Everyone doesn't have to be a real book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then,</v>

3409
02:47:04.190 --> 02:47:05.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what wonderful things could we achieve?</v>

3410
02:47:06.040 --> 02:47:09.440
<v Speaker 2>So I'm kind of optimistic there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you do</v>

3411
02:47:09.770 --> 02:47:10.290
<v Speaker 4>beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3412
02:47:10.291 --> 02:47:15.291
<v Speaker 4>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean obviously there's some real </v>

3413
02:47:15.291 --> 02:47:17.111
<v Speaker 4>issues with culture and society,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I often wonder as we talked about </v>

3414
02:47:17.111 --> 02:47:21.161
<v Speaker 4>before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if those issues just inspire us to </v>

3415
02:47:21.161 --> 02:47:23.831
<v Speaker 4>improve and change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you can't have a gun without a </v>

3416
02:47:23.831 --> 02:47:27.221
<v Speaker 4>yang,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you have a bunch of shit going </v>

3417
02:47:27.221 --> 02:47:27.221
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is,</v>

3418
02:47:27.221 --> 02:47:27.950
<v Speaker 4>it's like a constant ebb and flow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I always,</v>

3419
02:47:28.220 --> 02:47:31.120
<v Speaker 4>I always ponder whether or not that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>

3420
02:47:31.190 --> 02:47:36.190
<v Speaker 4>almost a mechanism for progress or a </v>
<v Speaker 4>mechanism for advancement and that </v>

3421
02:47:36.190 --> 02:47:36.920
<v Speaker 4>without it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't get that.</v>

3422
02:47:37.130 --> 02:47:37.730
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3423
02:47:38.450 --> 02:47:40.010
<v Speaker 2>It's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is possible.</v>

3424
02:47:40.160 --> 02:47:41.670
<v Speaker 2>So we can be optimistic at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>

3425
02:47:42.040 --> 02:47:44.530
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we wrapped it up nice.</v>

3426
02:47:44.531 --> 02:47:46.720
<v Speaker 4>I think we brought it home in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>beautiful way.</v>

3427
02:47:46.820 --> 02:47:48.400
<v Speaker 4>I can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I say just because,</v>

3428
02:47:48.401 --> 02:47:51.280
<v Speaker 4>because my promoters sat over there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I know he's been sitting there for three</v>

3429
