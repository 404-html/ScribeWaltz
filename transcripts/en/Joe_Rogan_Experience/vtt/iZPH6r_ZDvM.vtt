1
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.600
<v Speaker 1>Three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:04.470
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

3
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:12.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do what you're doing.</v>

4
00:00:12.611 --> 00:00:13.510
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing over there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man?</v>

5
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.510
<v Speaker 2>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.450
<v Speaker 2>actually I was thinking about making </v>
<v Speaker 2>sure that I'm in a position mentally and</v>

7
00:00:19.451 --> 00:00:23.320
<v Speaker 2>spiritually to talk openly and clearly </v>
<v Speaker 2>connect,</v>

8
00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.760
<v Speaker 2>but you're doing it with fists on </v>
<v Speaker 2>interest.</v>

9
00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.680
<v Speaker 2>You're going to talk openly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're going to be strong about it.</v>

10
00:00:29.681 --> 00:00:34.681
<v Speaker 2>It's not like this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this thing that the meditation </v>

11
00:00:34.681 --> 00:00:35.560
<v Speaker 2>thing where you're just gently touching </v>
<v Speaker 2>your fingers together.</v>

12
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

13
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.810
<v Speaker 2>I suppose then I'm looking to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>embodied as well.</v>

14
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.850
<v Speaker 2>Tense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like a hybrid.</v>

15
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

16
00:00:44.021 --> 00:00:46.420
<v Speaker 2>That's what we've got become these days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little bit of both.</v>

17
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.490
<v Speaker 2>A little bit of spiritual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of warrior,</v>

18
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.130
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've got to survive in this world,</v>

19
00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.070
<v Speaker 2>so you can't be all the theories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can't be.</v>

20
00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.490
<v Speaker 2>It can't all be in the consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

21
00:01:00.491 --> 00:01:01.750
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise you'll never get anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

22
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.430
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll just be constantly dealing with </v>

23
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.081
<v Speaker 2>other people's wants and wishes and no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless you going to make the decision to</v>

24
00:01:10.341 --> 00:01:15.341
<v Speaker 2>be one of those cave people unless you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because last time I was thinking about </v>

25
00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:15.341
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this,</v>

26
00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:15.341
<v Speaker 2>put on robes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meditate.</v>

27
00:01:15.341 --> 00:01:20.260
<v Speaker 2>I that I only live in the consciousness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but given my extreme levels of </v>

28
00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.020
<v Speaker 2>attachment that I've experienced over </v>
<v Speaker 2>the years to physical things,</v>

29
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's my path.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

30
00:01:24.581 --> 00:01:26.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the world,</v>

31
00:01:26.141 --> 00:01:31.141
<v Speaker 2>I'm sending books,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm having a baby or caring about what </v>

32
00:01:31.141 --> 00:01:35.251
<v Speaker 2>people think about me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm wondering if I'm going to be in a </v>

33
00:01:35.251 --> 00:01:35.251
<v Speaker 2>film.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm dealing with the world,</v>

34
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.410
<v Speaker 2>being a man in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being the type of man I am.</v>

35
00:01:38.411 --> 00:01:39.070
<v Speaker 2>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

36
00:01:39.071 --> 00:01:44.071
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just real life myself off in a </v>

37
00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:44.071
<v Speaker 2>cave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

38
00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:46.000
<v Speaker 2>there's a certain amount of attraction </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I think we all have this idea like,</v>

39
00:01:46.001 --> 00:01:47.740
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to get away from it all.</v>

40
00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.950
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going on whether you like it or </v>

41
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.950
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's happening.</v>

42
00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.510
<v Speaker 2>Even if you're not there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you should probably be there just to </v>

43
00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.510
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is this?</v>

44
00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is this?</v>

45
00:01:58.271 --> 00:02:02.050
<v Speaker 2>Even in Christianity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christ says in the world,</v>

46
00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.140
<v Speaker 2>but not of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So trying not to be defined and </v>

47
00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.410
<v Speaker 2>determined by other people's opinions of</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

48
00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.200
<v Speaker 2>the systems and structures that are set </v>
<v Speaker 2>up around you,</v>

49
00:02:11.201 --> 00:02:14.080
<v Speaker 2>particularly if you question those </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems and structures and think,</v>

50
00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.910
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't trust that system.</v>

51
00:02:15.911 --> 00:02:17.560
<v Speaker 2>I agree with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

52
00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.330
<v Speaker 2>just having how you don't want to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>defined by that.</v>

53
00:02:19.331 --> 00:02:23.110
<v Speaker 2>But the fact is we are here and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are certain people you know,</v>

54
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.470
<v Speaker 2>but do have a monastic tendency that </v>
<v Speaker 2>should be meditating,</v>

55
00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.130
<v Speaker 2>that aren't equipped for the material </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

56
00:02:30.131 --> 00:02:35.131
<v Speaker 2>And one of the great things that make me</v>
<v Speaker 2>sad about at times is if you don't have </v>

57
00:02:35.131 --> 00:02:37.530
<v Speaker 2>economic and productive value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you are nobody.</v>

58
00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.540
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there were some people that don't </v>

59
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.801
<v Speaker 2>know how to resource themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've found a way of turning yourself </v>

60
00:02:43.801 --> 00:02:44.890
<v Speaker 2>into an economy of creating a kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I found my own way.</v>

61
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.350
<v Speaker 2>If I can make my mental illness work for</v>
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>

62
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.060
<v Speaker 2>people me money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be this crazy,</v>

63
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not everyone gets those kinds of </v>

64
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.770
<v Speaker 2>breaks or has that kind of skillset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

65
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:59.191
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously there's some people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that really do thrive on that monastic </v>

66
00:02:59.191 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen</v>

67
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.950
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a vice documentary on this guy?</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

73
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.510
<v Speaker 3>a vice piece called Heimos Arctic </v>
<v Speaker 3>adventure.</v>

74
00:03:19.511 --> 00:03:21.070
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arctic refuge.</v>

75
00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.720
<v Speaker 3>Hi Mo.</v>

<v Speaker 3>HE lIves in the elastic arctic national </v>
<v Speaker 3>wildlife refuge,</v>

78
00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.900
<v Speaker 3>100 miles from tHe nearest human and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>lives there with his wife and he lives </v>

79
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.521
<v Speaker 3>in this little log house that he's sort </v>
<v Speaker 3>of built himself and he thrives up </v>

80
00:03:42.131 --> 00:03:44.120
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very strange because we're,</v>

81
00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.720
<v Speaker 3>we're attracted to these people like to </v>
<v Speaker 3>just go,</v>

82
00:03:46.721 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wHat do you do all day,</v>

83
00:03:47.771 --> 00:03:48.280
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

84
00:03:48.281 --> 00:03:53.281
<v Speaker 3>what's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's your life like and what do you </v>

85
00:03:53.281 --> 00:03:53.281
<v Speaker 3>do?</v>

86
00:03:53.281 --> 00:03:57.140
<v Speaker 3>And he has like a vcr and he plays old </v>
<v Speaker 3>movies and it's a fascinating thing </v>

87
00:03:57.821 --> 00:04:00.370
<v Speaker 3>because I think when you watch soMeone </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that,</v>

88
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.160
<v Speaker 3>you always run it through your head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

89
00:04:03.161 --> 00:04:04.330
<v Speaker 3>could I live like that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

90
00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:05.260
<v Speaker 3>is this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this,</v>

91
00:04:05.261 --> 00:04:07.300
<v Speaker 3>got happier?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he says he is.</v>

92
00:04:07.301 --> 00:04:08.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he says that the,</v>

93
00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:13.860
<v Speaker 3>the hunter gatherer lifestyle that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>lives is a uniquely attractive to people</v>

94
00:04:15.701 --> 00:04:20.701
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uniquely satisfying and it's </v>

95
00:04:20.701 --> 00:04:20.740
<v Speaker 3>something that we don't get in our </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyday world,</v>

96
00:04:20.741 --> 00:04:25.741
<v Speaker 3>so we're never like completely even.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas he is just running around </v>

97
00:04:25.741 --> 00:04:27.220
<v Speaker 3>fishing and hunting caribou and stuff,</v>

98
00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.880
<v Speaker 4>we're fitting in with someone's else's </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea of what life should be.</v>

99
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.460
<v Speaker 4>The system within which most of us </v>
<v Speaker 4>operate is not this.</v>

100
00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.660
<v Speaker 4>What I would do if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I had to free star,</v>

101
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't mean just personally me,</v>

102
00:04:41.271 --> 00:04:43.100
<v Speaker 4>russell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean anthropologically yeah.</v>

103
00:04:43.101 --> 00:04:47.090
<v Speaker 4>We're designed to be nabad nomadic </v>
<v Speaker 4>tribes people.</v>

104
00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.750
<v Speaker 4>When my podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as I said gestion by you,</v>

105
00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.170
<v Speaker 4>I had on as a guest,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yuval noah harari,</v>

106
00:04:54.171 --> 00:04:59.171
<v Speaker 4>he wrote that book sapiens and he does a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of anthropology stuff and says about</v>

107
00:04:59.271 --> 00:05:00.160
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

108
00:05:00.161 --> 00:05:05.161
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're designed to live in tribes of </v>

109
00:05:05.161 --> 00:05:07.001
<v Speaker 4>about 75 to 100 people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or at least that's what chimpanzees do </v>

110
00:05:07.001 --> 00:05:10.240
<v Speaker 4>when they get bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>THere's normally a conflict and a </v>

111
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.581
<v Speaker 4>separation and a split in that nomadic </v>
<v Speaker 4>tribes would follow the food sources </v>

112
00:05:13.041 --> 00:05:15.650
<v Speaker 4>that were available to them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>so in a way,</v>

113
00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.700
<v Speaker 4>if you can replicate that or get close </v>
<v Speaker 4>to that in some way of your own,</v>

114
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.760
<v Speaker 4>in your own life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it would make sense that it would make </v>

115
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.760
<v Speaker 4>you happy.</v>

116
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.970
<v Speaker 4>And we're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you were saying that about the guy </v>

117
00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.970
<v Speaker 4>is a hundred miles away from the nearest</v>
<v Speaker 4>person I fought people,</v>

118
00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:32.000
<v Speaker 4>there's people that live in suburbia </v>
<v Speaker 4>that mentally or 100 miles away from the</v>

119
00:05:32.001 --> 00:05:33.680
<v Speaker 4>nearest person that you're just really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your life is.</v>

120
00:05:33.681 --> 00:05:36.050
<v Speaker 4>You sit in front of a screen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't connect with.</v>

121
00:05:36.051 --> 00:05:38.330
<v Speaker 4>People hAve not spoke to people for </v>
<v Speaker 4>days.</v>

122
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.600
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think about this when people make </v>

123
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.041
<v Speaker 4>these desperate attempts to connect </v>
<v Speaker 4>through dog in his finger in my country </v>

124
00:05:45.041 --> 00:05:48.641
<v Speaker 4>where people meet up in labels and just </v>
<v Speaker 4>having anonymous sex masturbating in </v>

125
00:05:48.641 --> 00:05:52.361
<v Speaker 4>public dogging.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a uniquely british for nominal </v>

126
00:05:52.361 --> 00:05:52.450
<v Speaker 4>dogging.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where I heard of this.</v>

127
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:57.790
<v Speaker 4>Well welcome,</v>
<v Speaker 4>welcome to britain docking is people go </v>

128
00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.110
<v Speaker 4>la bise quite buyers and it still could </v>
<v Speaker 4>be sort of suburban is a bit like </v>

129
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.110
<v Speaker 4>swinging,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

130
00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:02.270
<v Speaker 4>but it's like you pull up in a car with </v>
<v Speaker 4>this isn't.</v>

131
00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:03.290
<v Speaker 4>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never done this.</v>

132
00:06:03.291 --> 00:06:05.990
<v Speaker 4>I'm just clarifying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You put up in a car with a partner,</v>

133
00:06:05.991 --> 00:06:06.530
<v Speaker 4>it could be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

134
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:11.531
<v Speaker 4>I think it's kind of heterosexual thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>or home that you can do it wherever you </v>

135
00:06:11.531 --> 00:06:11.531
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wherever your persuasion is.</v>

136
00:06:11.531 --> 00:06:14.120
<v Speaker 4>This particular place of particular </v>
<v Speaker 4>people and you know the lights go on and</v>

137
00:06:14.121 --> 00:06:19.121
<v Speaker 4>people jerk off and you know you can </v>
<v Speaker 4>have sex and so thinking these are </v>

138
00:06:19.121 --> 00:06:22.271
<v Speaker 4>desperate attempt to find some </v>
<v Speaker 4>connection to nature to sort of drop </v>

139
00:06:22.271 --> 00:06:27.120
<v Speaker 4>anchor and hit your prime or self to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>into who you are because you wake up and</v>

140
00:06:27.141 --> 00:06:32.141
<v Speaker 4>you've got to do your job and you've got</v>
<v Speaker 4>a screen in front of you and you're a </v>

141
00:06:32.141 --> 00:06:32.450
<v Speaker 4>consumer and you're not living in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>world anymore.</v>

142
00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.600
<v Speaker 4>You want some visceral experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things I get from these New </v>

143
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.600
<v Speaker 4>York guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

144
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.600
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your person.</v>

145
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.510
<v Speaker 4>That's questing after with the whether </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the artery or the dmt,</v>

146
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.680
<v Speaker 4>looking for what is it that we're meant </v>
<v Speaker 4>to be as humans and I'm doing that in my</v>

147
00:06:45.681 --> 00:06:50.681
<v Speaker 4>own way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Having unfortunately written off </v>

148
00:06:50.681 --> 00:06:51.140
<v Speaker 4>substances because my stupid stupid </v>
<v Speaker 4>mistakes in my twenties.</v>

149
00:06:51.141 --> 00:06:56.141
<v Speaker 4>I can't go into the dmt iowaska world's </v>
<v Speaker 4>much as I would like to and like I want </v>

150
00:06:56.141 --> 00:06:58.520
<v Speaker 4>to find how is it that I be me in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>world and yeah,</v>

151
00:06:58.521 --> 00:07:00.480
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it is through isolation </v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't.</v>

152
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:01.220
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

153
00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:04.430
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to try and get an island and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to participate.</v>

154
00:07:04.431 --> 00:07:07.580
<v Speaker 4>I think it's like write what you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We are nature.</v>

155
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.370
<v Speaker 4>We created this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a form of nature.</v>

156
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.880
<v Speaker 4>Our civilizations are manifestations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but is it the best we can do?</v>

157
00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:18.910
<v Speaker 4>Can we change it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can we pull back from what seems more </v>

158
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:20.480
<v Speaker 4>than ever like some kind of apocalypse </v>
<v Speaker 4>with your current president?</v>

159
00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:25.810
<v Speaker 4>No disrespect them with our country </v>
<v Speaker 4>breakfast of sort of like a weird time </v>

160
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.800
<v Speaker 4>of fracture and the manifestation of </v>
<v Speaker 4>ugliness stuff bubbling up.</v>

161
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:30.530
<v Speaker 4>Affiliate like dark unconscious matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bubbling up,</v>

162
00:07:30.531 --> 00:07:35.531
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was in the airport traveling to here </v>

163
00:07:35.531 --> 00:07:35.900
<v Speaker 4>and I was in New York and like just the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that are working the lines.</v>

164
00:07:35.901 --> 00:07:40.560
<v Speaker 4>When you put your cases through that </v>
<v Speaker 4>people felt seem heavy and low and like,</v>

165
00:07:40.590 --> 00:07:43.140
<v Speaker 4>because if you're british Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just something that you know,</v>

166
00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:48.180
<v Speaker 4>you kind of make jokes about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you hope that there isn't going to be a </v>

167
00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.561
<v Speaker 4>nuclear war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he seems like a sort of a comic </v>

168
00:07:50.561 --> 00:07:50.561
<v Speaker 4>figure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but here I sort of sent,</v>

169
00:07:50.561 --> 00:07:51.200
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's pain now.</v>

170
00:07:51.201 --> 00:07:56.201
<v Speaker 4>I know there's a lot of people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously liked him enough to have made </v>

171
00:07:56.201 --> 00:07:58.661
<v Speaker 4>him president of United States,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think even in those cases he </v>

172
00:07:58.661 --> 00:08:00.020
<v Speaker 4>speaks to a particular rage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Something that wasn't being addressed.</v>

173
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:05.230
<v Speaker 4>The failure of neoliberalism that lies </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the last 30 years of a kind of </v>

174
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:07.130
<v Speaker 4>politics that was just about management </v>
<v Speaker 4>and not about giving people truth.</v>

175
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:09.210
<v Speaker 4>I don't know joe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>

176
00:08:09.211 --> 00:08:10.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like our individual journeys.</v>

177
00:08:10.731 --> 00:08:15.731
<v Speaker 4>How can our individual journeys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>informal social and tribal journeys now </v>

178
00:08:15.731 --> 00:08:19.361
<v Speaker 4>national journeys and he's ever even </v>
<v Speaker 4>hope anymore for such a thing as United </v>

179
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:24.610
<v Speaker 4>States of America or great britain.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or should we start looking at smaller </v>

180
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:24.610
<v Speaker 4>projects?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you know,</v>

181
00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:26.690
<v Speaker 4>if the United States of America and </v>
<v Speaker 4>great britain leads the colonialism,</v>

182
00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:28.640
<v Speaker 4>mass capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>consumerism,</v>

183
00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:30.740
<v Speaker 4>ecological meltdown.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If that's what you believe in,</v>

184
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.580
<v Speaker 4>then maybe we need to look at breaking </v>
<v Speaker 4>down some of these great institutions.</v>

185
00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:39.980
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if what's going on is that our </v>
<v Speaker 3>biology and what we've been sort of </v>

186
00:08:40.141 --> 00:08:45.141
<v Speaker 3>programmed to for the thousands of years</v>
<v Speaker 3>of living these tribal existences where </v>

187
00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:50.180
<v Speaker 3>in these travel existence where you had </v>
<v Speaker 3>the small groups of 50 to 60 or 100 </v>

188
00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:54.051
<v Speaker 3>people plus that this is the new thing </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that part of our chaos is are trying</v>

189
00:08:55.681 --> 00:08:58.380
<v Speaker 3>to adapt to the new thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost inevitable.</v>

190
00:08:58.381 --> 00:09:03.381
<v Speaker 3>We've created this incredible way where </v>
<v Speaker 3>we can get food to people so more people</v>

191
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:09.980
<v Speaker 3>had babies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>more people stayed in these areas where </v>

192
00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:10.260
<v Speaker 3>they're not growing food and then you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have.</v>

193
00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.710
<v Speaker 3>You're dealing with these massive </v>
<v Speaker 3>numbers of people you know,</v>

194
00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:17.430
<v Speaker 3>in la 20 plus million and we're trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to figure out like how do we get along?</v>

195
00:09:17.431 --> 00:09:20.790
<v Speaker 3>Like how do all these different </v>
<v Speaker 3>ideologies coincide?</v>

196
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:21.600
<v Speaker 3>How do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do we,</v>

197
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:23.180
<v Speaker 3>how do we cooperate?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do we,</v>

198
00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.980
<v Speaker 3>how do we figure out what to do with all</v>
<v Speaker 3>our waste?</v>

199
00:09:26.340 --> 00:09:29.370
<v Speaker 3>I don't figure out what to do with what </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're doing to the environment.</v>

200
00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:32.220
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do we figure out who's right,</v>

201
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:37.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it is a the doom and gloom people </v>

202
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:38.010
<v Speaker 3>correct or that we're going to be okay </v>
<v Speaker 3>people correct.</v>

203
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:38.870
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what's,</v>

204
00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:40.980
<v Speaker 3>what's the right attitude to take about </v>
<v Speaker 3>this?</v>

205
00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:45.040
<v Speaker 4>Many of those significant movements that</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're talking about,</v>

206
00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:49.300
<v Speaker 4>agriculture and industrialization and </v>
<v Speaker 4>urbanization,</v>

207
00:09:49.301 --> 00:09:54.301
<v Speaker 4>agriculture obviously meaning food </v>
<v Speaker 4>available on mass industrialization,</v>

208
00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:58.930
<v Speaker 4>products available on mass urbanization,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people living together en masse.</v>

209
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:03.250
<v Speaker 4>None of these things are good for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>people on mass.</v>

210
00:10:03.251 --> 00:10:07.420
<v Speaker 4>They're good for a select straw of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people that primarily benefit.</v>

211
00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:08.970
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the app,</v>

212
00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:14.070
<v Speaker 4>they say that the average diet of human </v>
<v Speaker 4>being got worse after agriculture before</v>

213
00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:16.780
<v Speaker 4>that varied diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People with loads of stuff after I coach</v>

214
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:17.920
<v Speaker 4>her urine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>potatoes,</v>

215
00:10:17.921 --> 00:10:19.780
<v Speaker 4>now peasant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're on rice now,</v>

216
00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:24.840
<v Speaker 4>peasants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think each of these movements are to </v>

217
00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.670
<v Speaker 4>benefit a particular aspect of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>system of particular class,</v>

218
00:10:27.671 --> 00:10:30.160
<v Speaker 4>a particular structure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a particular economic class,</v>

219
00:10:30.161 --> 00:10:33.250
<v Speaker 4>and you know me and you ain't doing bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have relatively near the top,</v>

220
00:10:33.251 --> 00:10:34.700
<v Speaker 4>but we're not the engineers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It.</v>

221
00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:39.810
<v Speaker 4>There are corporations and elites to use</v>
<v Speaker 4>that very popular word these days that </v>

222
00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.490
<v Speaker 4>benefit from things being like this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

223
00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:47.580
<v Speaker 4>When you're saying is there a way that </v>
<v Speaker 4>we can all coalesce and get along in </v>

224
00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:48.040
<v Speaker 4>urban conurbations are 20 million </v>
<v Speaker 4>people?</v>

225
00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:50.560
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because the power is to centralized.</v>

226
00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:51.940
<v Speaker 4>Don't break down.</v>

227
00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:54.290
<v Speaker 3>Mostly we are getting along maybe </v>
<v Speaker 3>mostly.</v>

228
00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:59.320
<v Speaker 3>Mostly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mostly we are getting along in these </v>

229
00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:00.290
<v Speaker 3>weird groups and even with our whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>static that we have with each other.</v>

230
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:05.790
<v Speaker 3>Even with the weird weirdness of it all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the diffusion of responsibility that </v>

231
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.650
<v Speaker 3>comes with these gigantic groups and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>see things happening,</v>

232
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:12.680
<v Speaker 3>you just get away from them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We still for the most part of getting </v>

233
00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:12.710
<v Speaker 3>along in this weird new world,</v>

234
00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:14.960
<v Speaker 4>I think you'll write it in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>joe,</v>

235
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:16.490
<v Speaker 4>like I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a demon,</v>

236
00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:18.350
<v Speaker 4>clean guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think human beings really,</v>

237
00:11:18.351 --> 00:11:20.970
<v Speaker 4>really beautiful and brilliant and like </v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't feel like,</v>

238
00:11:20.971 --> 00:11:22.280
<v Speaker 4>oh god,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is such a mess.</v>

239
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:27.640
<v Speaker 4>what I think is is that we're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>inhabit systems that are not designed </v>

240
00:11:27.981 --> 00:11:30.750
<v Speaker 4>for us to live within and I think that </v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

241
00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:35.800
<v Speaker 4>people are getting on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I also think that there's a lot of </v>

242
00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.930
<v Speaker 4>tension in cities that everyone's one </v>
<v Speaker 4>right turn or one traffic light away </v>

243
00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:39.650
<v Speaker 4>from getting out of their car and </v>
<v Speaker 4>smashing someone in the face.</v>

244
00:11:39.651 --> 00:11:41.150
<v Speaker 4>You could like feel it bubbling under in</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

245
00:11:41.151 --> 00:11:46.151
<v Speaker 4>in that the feeling I had in the airport</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that the people that were working </v>

246
00:11:46.151 --> 00:11:47.100
<v Speaker 4>there were under undue stress.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

247
00:11:47.101 --> 00:11:52.101
<v Speaker 4>this is just one anecdote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I feel that we're being forced to </v>

248
00:11:52.101 --> 00:11:52.850
<v Speaker 4>live on a particular aspect of our </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness,</v>

249
00:11:52.851 --> 00:11:56.590
<v Speaker 4>a particular bandwidth of where we kind </v>
<v Speaker 4>of a bit fry in the foot a little bit.</v>

250
00:11:56.590 --> 00:12:00.340
<v Speaker 4>Too much desire and I'm talking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>most people.</v>

251
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:05.370
<v Speaker 4>We're again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not poor no more so I'm able to </v>

252
00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:05.620
<v Speaker 4>create money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Creates distance.</v>

253
00:12:05.621 --> 00:12:07.570
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Money's like you can fuck off problems.</v>

254
00:12:07.571 --> 00:12:09.280
<v Speaker 4>I'm getting in a nice car and I'm out of</v>
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>

255
00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:12.520
<v Speaker 4>but like I remember the feeling and a </v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of people are living like that where</v>

256
00:12:12.521 --> 00:12:15.400
<v Speaker 4>the tensions up in their face and so </v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

257
00:12:15.401 --> 00:12:20.401
<v Speaker 4>I agree that people do muddle along and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's I think shows you that we're not </v>

258
00:12:20.401 --> 00:12:24.600
<v Speaker 4>as in a darwinistic model or or or some </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the ideas derived from darwinism </v>

259
00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:28.831
<v Speaker 4>rather like the selfish gene and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>richard dawkins idea that people just </v>

260
00:12:28.831 --> 00:12:28.831
<v Speaker 4>want to survive and we just want to kill</v>
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>

261
00:12:28.831 --> 00:12:30.160
<v Speaker 4>Fucking with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what propels us forward.</v>

262
00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.480
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

263
00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:33.610
<v Speaker 4>we're coke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're cooperative,</v>

264
00:12:33.640 --> 00:12:35.590
<v Speaker 4>collaborative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>artistic,</v>

265
00:12:35.591 --> 00:12:37.210
<v Speaker 4>imaginative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>beautiful people,</v>

266
00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:40.360
<v Speaker 4>but we've created systems around the </v>
<v Speaker 4>worst aspects of our nature.</v>

267
00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.220
<v Speaker 4>Greed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>selfishness.</v>

268
00:12:42.250 --> 00:12:46.600
<v Speaker 4>This is what capitalism and consumerism </v>
<v Speaker 4>on and this is so all encompassing.</v>

269
00:12:46.601 --> 00:12:49.840
<v Speaker 4>Our cultures are domed by them and we </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't see beyond them.</v>

270
00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:55.140
<v Speaker 4>We exist within them and I feel like if </v>
<v Speaker 4>we were to break down those kinds of </v>

271
00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:56.770
<v Speaker 4>systems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>live in smaller assemblies,</v>

272
00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:01.800
<v Speaker 4>smaller groups where power is as close </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the people that affects as possible,</v>

273
00:13:01.841 --> 00:13:03.040
<v Speaker 4>where people would vote on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

274
00:13:03.041 --> 00:13:04.600
<v Speaker 4>this is how we want to use our </v>
<v Speaker 4>resources.</v>

275
00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:07.420
<v Speaker 4>This is where we want to run our street,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our hospital,</v>

276
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.220
<v Speaker 4>our prisons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our schools,</v>

277
00:13:09.221 --> 00:13:11.140
<v Speaker 4>our systems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is how we want them to run.</v>

278
00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:13.300
<v Speaker 4>Then things which really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really slow down,</v>

279
00:13:13.301 --> 00:13:18.301
<v Speaker 4>but man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the rush into things would slow </v>

280
00:13:18.301 --> 00:13:20.431
<v Speaker 4>down and get a lot slower,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think that people would be </v>

281
00:13:20.431 --> 00:13:22.891
<v Speaker 4>empowered and you wouldn't have </v>
<v Speaker 4>resources and power filtered to a small </v>

282
00:13:22.891 --> 00:13:22.891
<v Speaker 4>group of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

283
00:13:22.891 --> 00:13:27.500
<v Speaker 4>I think you're definitely right and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think you should probably start a cult </v>

284
00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.090
<v Speaker 4>idea about how to run it and how to keep</v>

285
00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:33.210
<v Speaker 3>so the resources in the community,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that also this discontent </v>

286
00:13:33.210 --> 00:13:37.471
<v Speaker 3>that we have is a sign that people being</v>
<v Speaker 3>upset with how this is and the momentum </v>

287
00:13:37.471 --> 00:13:39.670
<v Speaker 3>of the way things have sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>established themselves today.</v>

288
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:45.030
<v Speaker 3>That we is what we need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the momentum and the motivation </v>

289
00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:47.440
<v Speaker 3>that we need to try to improve upon </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

290
00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:49.830
<v Speaker 3>I think we're uniquely qualified to do </v>
<v Speaker 3>that today because we're.</v>

291
00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:52.720
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about it so you can be the</v>
<v Speaker 3>doom and gloom guy today.</v>

292
00:13:52.721 --> 00:13:57.721
<v Speaker 3>I'll be rose colored glasses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I think that this tension that we </v>

293
00:13:57.721 --> 00:14:00.691
<v Speaker 3>have in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even like a guy like Donald Trump or </v>

294
00:14:00.691 --> 00:14:03.451
<v Speaker 3>brexit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the good thing about those </v>

295
00:14:03.451 --> 00:14:06.241
<v Speaker 3>things is that people are looking at </v>
<v Speaker 3>what they don't like about the way we </v>

296
00:14:06.241 --> 00:14:10.601
<v Speaker 3>were running the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they don't like about our culture </v>

297
00:14:10.601 --> 00:14:12.940
<v Speaker 3>and they're getting upset about it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hopefully we'll sort it out that way and</v>

298
00:14:12.941 --> 00:14:16.000
<v Speaker 3>that being completely content with </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything and everybody just sitting on</v>

299
00:14:16.001 --> 00:14:21.001
<v Speaker 3>the couch and smiling all day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't lead to necessarily lead to </v>

300
00:14:21.001 --> 00:14:25.081
<v Speaker 3>progress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're more informed now than </v>

301
00:14:25.081 --> 00:14:26.740
<v Speaker 3>we've ever been before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I would hope that with our ability to</v>

302
00:14:26.741 --> 00:14:31.741
<v Speaker 3>communicate and being more informed now </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we have the potential to move </v>

303
00:14:31.741 --> 00:14:32.050
<v Speaker 3>towards a better society.</v>

304
00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:36.630
<v Speaker 4>I agree with that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I also think that that was important</v>

305
00:14:36.631 --> 00:14:41.631
<v Speaker 4>in the world is who has power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>power being the ability to affect </v>

306
00:14:41.631 --> 00:14:41.631
<v Speaker 4>change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

307
00:14:41.631 --> 00:14:42.540
<v Speaker 4>I'm not one of those people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

308
00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:45.180
<v Speaker 4>I'm not like baffled by what happened </v>
<v Speaker 4>with trump.</v>

309
00:14:45.181 --> 00:14:45.930
<v Speaker 4>I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

310
00:14:45.931 --> 00:14:50.931
<v Speaker 4>there's an indication that a good many </v>
<v Speaker 4>people feel extremely angry and </v>

311
00:14:50.931 --> 00:14:54.171
<v Speaker 4>disenfranchised the same as brexit and </v>
<v Speaker 4>our country and I recognize and </v>

312
00:14:54.171 --> 00:14:54.830
<v Speaker 4>understand it similarly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think,</v>

313
00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:57.380
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't everything be zippity doo dah.</v>

314
00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.900
<v Speaker 4>If hillary clinton was president of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>United States,</v>

315
00:14:59.901 --> 00:15:04.901
<v Speaker 4>that was where the way stuff was going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what the previous 30 years has </v>

316
00:15:04.901 --> 00:15:04.910
<v Speaker 4>been like in your country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My country,</v>

317
00:15:04.911 --> 00:15:09.890
<v Speaker 4>managerial politicians with no vision.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've seen the failure of recent sort of</v>

318
00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:12.980
<v Speaker 4>that they've kind of promises that were </v>
<v Speaker 4>offered by an administrations recently.</v>

319
00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:15.730
<v Speaker 4>I think that what trump is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what brexit is,</v>

320
00:15:15.731 --> 00:15:19.970
<v Speaker 4>is a big fuck you to the system like we </v>
<v Speaker 4>want something different,</v>

321
00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:23.780
<v Speaker 4>but for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a way these things are good because I</v>

322
00:15:24.110 --> 00:15:26.930
<v Speaker 4>believe that people that fill those </v>
<v Speaker 4>things are right and I would like to see</v>

323
00:15:26.931 --> 00:15:28.910
<v Speaker 4>more power delivered to ordinary people.</v>

324
00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:33.940
<v Speaker 4>Genuine change happening now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think it won't happen unless you </v>

325
00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:33.940
<v Speaker 4>sort of look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

326
00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:34.700
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where is the power?</v>

327
00:15:34.701 --> 00:15:39.701
<v Speaker 4>Really the power really is with people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that this system works for a sort of a </v>

328
00:15:39.701 --> 00:15:42.350
<v Speaker 4>particular corporate elite,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a particular straw.</v>

329
00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000
<v Speaker 4>I Don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Politicians and bureaucrats and I hope </v>

330
00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.341
<v Speaker 4>that what the sort of cataclysms of </v>
<v Speaker 4>recent recent news lead to is devolution</v>

331
00:15:51.530 --> 00:15:56.530
<v Speaker 4>of power new systems because even in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>time that I've been in the country on </v>

332
00:15:56.530 --> 00:15:56.720
<v Speaker 4>this trip,</v>
<v Speaker 4>joe,</v>

333
00:15:56.721 --> 00:16:01.721
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there'd been that mad sort of massacre </v>

334
00:16:01.721 --> 00:16:04.640
<v Speaker 4>that it sort of for me is it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this tells me that this is a sick </v>

335
00:16:05.391 --> 00:16:06.430
<v Speaker 4>society,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>

336
00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:07.830
<v Speaker 4>not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

337
00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.320
<v Speaker 4>and britain's wonderful of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

338
00:16:09.321 --> 00:16:11.000
<v Speaker 4>we went round plundering the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy,</v>

339
00:16:11.001 --> 00:16:12.440
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've got enough problems with our own,</v>

340
00:16:12.441 --> 00:16:14.990
<v Speaker 4>but like for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is causing this?</v>

341
00:16:14.991 --> 00:16:16.430
<v Speaker 4>Why is this hAppening?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

342
00:16:16.431 --> 00:16:18.080
<v Speaker 4>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't see it in isolation.</v>

343
00:16:18.081 --> 00:16:23.081
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe in lone wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the system is coughing up these </v>

344
00:16:23.081 --> 00:16:26.390
<v Speaker 4>events and there are patterns and </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's things that we can read and </v>

345
00:16:26.390 --> 00:16:26.390
<v Speaker 4>there are things that we can change to </v>
<v Speaker 4>improve it.</v>

346
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:29.350
<v Speaker 3>Certainly a part of the guy that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>that shooter was certainly a part of our</v>

347
00:16:29.351 --> 00:16:30.520
<v Speaker 3>society.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

348
00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:32.550
<v Speaker 3>So if we have a set culture,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

349
00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:34.360
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's eVidenCe of it.</v>

350
00:16:34.361 --> 00:16:35.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it not,</v>

351
00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.700
<v Speaker 3>it's not a completely set cultuRe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

352
00:16:36.701 --> 00:16:38.290
<v Speaker 3>we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not all dying,</v>

353
00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.520
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not all,</v>

354
00:16:39.521 --> 00:16:43.660
<v Speaker 3>we don't have all have this disease,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some of us most certainly do.</v>

355
00:16:43.690 --> 00:16:48.690
<v Speaker 3>So this thing that you're saying like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that people looked at Donald Trump as a </v>

356
00:16:48.690 --> 00:16:50.580
<v Speaker 3>big fuck you to system the tipping over </v>
<v Speaker 3>the apple cart.</v>

357
00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:52.960
<v Speaker 3>I think that's absolutely what people </v>
<v Speaker 3>were hoping for.</v>

358
00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.030
<v Speaker 3>And then there's a bunch of people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>just love saying,</v>

359
00:16:55.031 --> 00:16:57.190
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a bunch of people that went,</v>

360
00:16:57.191 --> 00:16:58.700
<v Speaker 3>fuck you is flying around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

361
00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:00.040
<v Speaker 3>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just get in it.</v>

362
00:17:00.041 --> 00:17:05.041
<v Speaker 3>Fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you're seeing a lot of that </v>

363
00:17:05.041 --> 00:17:05.041
<v Speaker 3>with Donald Trump supporters as well.</v>

364
00:17:05.041 --> 00:17:07.150
<v Speaker 3>You're seeing people that they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking for some excitement,</v>

365
00:17:07.151 --> 00:17:09.370
<v Speaker 3>they're looking for some fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're looking,</v>

366
00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:11.260
<v Speaker 3>you're seeing people that enjoy chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

367
00:17:11.261 --> 00:17:16.261
<v Speaker 3>maybe they're trapped in cubicles and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're just completely frustrated by </v>

368
00:17:16.261 --> 00:17:19.621
<v Speaker 3>this fucking grind day to day grind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like literally being their soul,</v>

369
00:17:21.341 --> 00:17:25.030
<v Speaker 3>being ground down a cheese grater every </v>
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>

370
00:17:25.270 --> 00:17:30.270
<v Speaker 3>being forced to stay under these </v>
<v Speaker 3>fluorescent lights and it was fucking </v>

371
00:17:30.270 --> 00:17:33.571
<v Speaker 3>small little box dealing with human </v>
<v Speaker 3>resources in the corporate environment </v>

372
00:17:33.571 --> 00:17:35.980
<v Speaker 3>and they're going fucking crazy and </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything that happens that,</v>

373
00:17:36.010 --> 00:17:38.110
<v Speaker 3>that tips that over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all fight club,</v>

374
00:17:38.111 --> 00:17:39.520
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just going to get punched in the</v>

375
00:17:39.521 --> 00:17:41.050
<v Speaker 3>face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're looking to go crazy.</v>

376
00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:43.240
<v Speaker 3>Then there's a lot of that as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

377
00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:48.130
<v Speaker 3>but I think this chaos,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the worst parts about it,</v>

378
00:17:48.131 --> 00:17:49.200
<v Speaker 3>there's no good too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

379
00:17:49.201 --> 00:17:50.040
<v Speaker 3>There's no good to mass</v>

380
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:55.040
<v Speaker 2>shootings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what comes out of all these things </v>

381
00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:57.801
<v Speaker 2>is the discussions and the intense </v>
<v Speaker 2>realization that we have real problems </v>

382
00:17:57.801 --> 00:18:01.870
<v Speaker 2>with real problems with the way we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>communicating with each other and I </v>

383
00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:05.271
<v Speaker 2>don't necessarily know if the solution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it would certainly be a solution </v>

384
00:18:05.271 --> 00:18:08.691
<v Speaker 2>for those Involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you get 100 amazing people and </v>

385
00:18:08.691 --> 00:18:08.691
<v Speaker 2>everybody just starts a co op and Maine </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere.</v>

386
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:09.210
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

387
00:18:09.211 --> 00:18:11.460
<v Speaker 2>it'd be great for those involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for,</v>

388
00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:13.710
<v Speaker 2>for all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean even while that,</v>

389
00:18:13.711 --> 00:18:15.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's almost like the monastic </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle we're talking about.</v>

390
00:18:15.901 --> 00:18:18.780
<v Speaker 2>If everybody just isolates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all going on around you.</v>

391
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:23.870
<v Speaker 2>If you put your phone in a drawer and </v>
<v Speaker 2>never use it again and you stay off the </v>

392
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:24.600
<v Speaker 2>grid and you get your water from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>spring,</v>

393
00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:29.840
<v Speaker 2>all those people out there still </v>
<v Speaker 2>drinking water with antidepressants in </v>

394
00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.650
<v Speaker 2>it and there's a bunch of fucking small </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the people have to deal with.</v>

395
00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:36.650
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of problems with </v>
<v Speaker 2>hurricanes now because the water's </v>

396
00:18:36.650 --> 00:18:36.930
<v Speaker 2>warmer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's inevitable.</v>

397
00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:40.140
<v Speaker 2>it's inevitable that this is all you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>decide,</v>

398
00:18:40.141 --> 00:18:45.141
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only have 100 years in this planet </v>

399
00:18:45.141 --> 00:18:45.141
<v Speaker 2>fund this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to ride this out.</v>

400
00:18:45.141 --> 00:18:47.910
<v Speaker 2>But if you do make a kid and you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've got a bunch of them.</v>

401
00:18:47.940 --> 00:18:49.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean you would see what's gonna happen</v>
<v Speaker 2>to them.</v>

402
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:51.690
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to think about what happens with</v>

403
00:18:51.691 --> 00:18:54.330
<v Speaker 2>them as well were we're all this global </v>
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>

404
00:18:54.331 --> 00:18:54.930
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

405
00:18:54.931 --> 00:18:59.931
<v Speaker 2>we are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why I don't go for the head </v>

406
00:18:59.931 --> 00:18:59.970
<v Speaker 2>dominique lifestyle of our fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got a century.</v>

407
00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:05.510
<v Speaker 2>let's line up some blowjobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried that route and that fellow john,</v>

408
00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.250
<v Speaker 2>let's get a century worth of pillow </v>
<v Speaker 2>tops.</v>

409
00:19:10.230 --> 00:19:12.650
<v Speaker 2>Line up some blow jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ice cream here,</v>

410
00:19:12.780 --> 00:19:17.780
<v Speaker 2>brother Joe Cook because I like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in the possibility of change and</v>

411
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:21.810
<v Speaker 2>I've been like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

412
00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:22.830
<v Speaker 2>I mentioned it again.</v>

413
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:24.700
<v Speaker 2>I started a podcast because you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

414
00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:26.840
<v Speaker 2>cost and he's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's good fun.</v>

415
00:19:26.841 --> 00:19:31.841
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I do on mine is I get like a </v>

416
00:19:31.841 --> 00:19:32.550
<v Speaker 2>because I'm doing a university degree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>religion and global politics.</v>

417
00:19:32.551 --> 00:19:35.240
<v Speaker 2>In fact this thing happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened to me really is I hit full</v>

418
00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:38.060
<v Speaker 2>on a full right now I know a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things on it.</v>

419
00:19:38.061 --> 00:19:39.240
<v Speaker 2>Gonna work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ice cream,</v>

420
00:19:39.241 --> 00:19:40.430
<v Speaker 2>the blow jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the attention,</v>

421
00:19:40.450 --> 00:19:41.730
<v Speaker 2>the privilege,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heroin,</v>

422
00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:42.630
<v Speaker 2>crack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these things.</v>

423
00:19:42.631 --> 00:19:44.190
<v Speaker 2>I control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cough is not working.</v>

424
00:19:44.191 --> 00:19:46.770
<v Speaker 2>I can't control them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to find a way through this.</v>

425
00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:51.210
<v Speaker 2>Oddly peculiarly it's a sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>personal version of spirituality.</v>

426
00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what I've found.</v>

427
00:19:53.071 --> 00:19:58.071
<v Speaker 2>William blake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the great english poet says each artist </v>

428
00:19:58.071 --> 00:19:58.710
<v Speaker 2>must find his own religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to find our own way.</v>

429
00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.290
<v Speaker 2>What works for you is not going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same as what works for me.</v>

430
00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:03.060
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are ways that we're coLlective,</v>

431
00:20:03.061 --> 00:20:04.780
<v Speaker 2>but there are ways where we are </v>
<v Speaker 2>individually.</v>

432
00:20:05.130 --> 00:20:07.350
<v Speaker 2>So fulbright are going to have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>educate myself,</v>

433
00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:09.060
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to have to do things that mean</v>
<v Speaker 2>something to me.</v>

434
00:20:09.061 --> 00:20:11.430
<v Speaker 2>A big part of that was like write me and</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>

435
00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:12.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my own small,</v>

436
00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:16.180
<v Speaker 2>fragile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brittle way brazilian jujitsu go,</v>

437
00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:21.330
<v Speaker 2>I've never done stuff like that before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So go and live in your body being there </v>

438
00:20:21.330 --> 00:20:25.010
<v Speaker 2>and go genesis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jimmy marlow and giving them a drop </v>

439
00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:25.010
<v Speaker 2>because all these guys are such big fans</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your show,</v>

440
00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:28.761
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I go there and I do sessions with </v>

441
00:20:28.761 --> 00:20:30.621
<v Speaker 2>chris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that titanium skeleton of a man that </v>

442
00:20:30.621 --> 00:20:31.660
<v Speaker 2>twists me up and can cause paIn in ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what,</v>

443
00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:36.680
<v Speaker 2>how was he even doing that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like when I try to do this stuff </v>

444
00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:36.680
<v Speaker 2>back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't work or it puts me in my body</v>

445
00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:36.930
<v Speaker 2>in a different way.</v>

446
00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.560
<v Speaker 2>Learning the history of the ideas that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're in in religion.</v>

447
00:20:40.561 --> 00:20:41.450
<v Speaker 2>The way that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

448
00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:46.730
<v Speaker 2>the distinction between politics and </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion is an sort of an imaginary </v>

449
00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:50.301
<v Speaker 2>distinction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When people talk about religious </v>

450
00:20:50.301 --> 00:20:52.561
<v Speaker 2>violence versus secular violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're saying their violence is a </v>

451
00:20:52.561 --> 00:20:55.401
<v Speaker 2>rational and our violence is okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've learned some amazing stuff in the </v>

452
00:20:55.401 --> 00:20:56.650
<v Speaker 2>last few years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the and as a result of that,</v>

453
00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.290
<v Speaker 2>the kind of guests I get on my podcast </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this guy,</v>

454
00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:00.860
<v Speaker 2>can ross mate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd love him on yours.</v>

455
00:21:00.910 --> 00:21:03.340
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a diplomat in the foreign service</v>

456
00:21:03.341 --> 00:21:06.280
<v Speaker 2>around the time of the weapons of mass </v>
<v Speaker 2>destruction and nine slash 11.</v>

457
00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.520
<v Speaker 2>He believed in the system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

458
00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:10.330
<v Speaker 2>all he wanted was to work in the foreign</v>
<v Speaker 2>service.</v>

459
00:21:10.331 --> 00:21:12.440
<v Speaker 2>He knew they were lying while it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on,</v>

460
00:21:12.441 --> 00:21:13.900
<v Speaker 2>so he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no.</v>

461
00:21:13.901 --> 00:21:18.901
<v Speaker 2>This thing I believed in is not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he's being asked to participate in </v>

462
00:21:18.901 --> 00:21:18.901
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

463
00:21:18.901 --> 00:21:23.880
<v Speaker 2>He come out of a foreign office and </v>
<v Speaker 2>believes that no centralized power can </v>

464
00:21:24.221 --> 00:21:29.221
<v Speaker 2>ever work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to have devolved power </v>

465
00:21:29.221 --> 00:21:29.530
<v Speaker 2>assemblies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anarchism is the word,</v>

466
00:21:29.630 --> 00:21:34.630
<v Speaker 2>and a key doesn't mean chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anarchy means devolve power to the </v>

467
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:37.570
<v Speaker 2>smallest possible groups that there's no</v>
<v Speaker 2>power between you and I and jamie,</v>

468
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:42.630
<v Speaker 2>that we're equal in here and we should </v>
<v Speaker 2>run the space according to what all of </v>

469
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:43.540
<v Speaker 2>us think is a group that hospitals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>schools,</v>

470
00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:48.570
<v Speaker 2>or institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>community should be run on a democratic </v>

471
00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:49.210
<v Speaker 2>basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need to minimize the amount of</v>

472
00:21:49.211 --> 00:21:51.330
<v Speaker 2>centralized or eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need roads to be running,</v>

473
00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:56.340
<v Speaker 2>needs to be some security and all those </v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of things based will be minimized </v>

474
00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:59.341
<v Speaker 2>where possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what this guy came away with and </v>

475
00:21:59.341 --> 00:21:59.920
<v Speaker 2>he explained it real well to me and what</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked the increasingly.</v>

476
00:21:59.921 --> 00:22:04.390
<v Speaker 2>What I think is that when you talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>that make the cheese grater on the soul,</v>

477
00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:04.960
<v Speaker 2>that's the.</v>

478
00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:06.670
<v Speaker 2>That's the phenomenon of the west,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

479
00:22:06.671 --> 00:22:11.671
<v Speaker 2>that's what people in our countries are </v>
<v Speaker 2>going through is alienation is talked </v>

480
00:22:11.671 --> 00:22:14.620
<v Speaker 2>about like in one of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>navigates taught me about marxism,</v>

481
00:22:14.621 --> 00:22:18.610
<v Speaker 2>that marxist theory of the way that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>criticized and broke down capitalism,</v>

482
00:22:18.611 --> 00:22:20.890
<v Speaker 2>how operates it weren't just talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the economics,</v>

483
00:22:20.891 --> 00:22:23.740
<v Speaker 2>so mark's was a great economist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

484
00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:29.280
<v Speaker 2>capitalism will lead to individuals </v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling worthless and meaningless </v>

485
00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:29.280
<v Speaker 2>because they'll just be cogs in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>machine.</v>

486
00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:32.720
<v Speaker 2>It will break people's spirits and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is what's happened because people sell.</v>

487
00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:34.930
<v Speaker 2>Not the only thing that's happened go </v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

488
00:22:34.931 --> 00:22:39.070
<v Speaker 2>It's also created incredible technology </v>
<v Speaker 2>and medical innovation,</v>

489
00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.220
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of different ways that we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>make the world easier.</v>

490
00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:45.710
<v Speaker 2>Do you think we could keep those things </v>
<v Speaker 2>without the cheese grater soulmate?</v>

491
00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:47.950
<v Speaker 2>Because I think we couLd think we could </v>
<v Speaker 2>call the stuff now.</v>

492
00:22:47.951 --> 00:22:49.030
<v Speaker 2>We could progress with it.</v>

493
00:22:49.030 --> 00:22:52.000
<v Speaker 2>We could have different fare or ways of </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing that and people were like,</v>

494
00:22:52.001 --> 00:22:54.670
<v Speaker 2>I think people sort of kill that </v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation too early because there's,</v>

495
00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:59.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's working for the enough </v>

496
00:22:59.880 --> 00:22:59.880
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

497
00:22:59.880 --> 00:22:59.880
<v Speaker 2>The throwing out the baby with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bathwater.</v>

498
00:22:59.880 --> 00:22:59.880
<v Speaker 2>I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

499
00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:04.660
<v Speaker 2>That's what the whole thing of marxism </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the abandonment of capitalism and so </v>

500
00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:04.660
<v Speaker 2>let's go this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

501
00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:08.080
<v Speaker 2>you look at what happened when people </v>
<v Speaker 2>adopted marxism and left the lead to the</v>

502
00:23:08.081 --> 00:23:10.300
<v Speaker 2>death of millions and millions of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

503
00:23:10.301 --> 00:23:15.301
<v Speaker 2>as capitalism and a lot of places we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>been all f's but it's not reported in </v>

504
00:23:15.301 --> 00:23:19.501
<v Speaker 2>the same way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not saying that we will want to </v>

505
00:23:19.501 --> 00:23:19.501
<v Speaker 2>live in communist Russia or the soviet </v>
<v Speaker 2>union or China.</v>

506
00:23:19.501 --> 00:23:20.500
<v Speaker 2>Terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible things happened there,</v>

507
00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:23.370
<v Speaker 2>but that's what we always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We always revert to say,</v>

508
00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:24.160
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there not?</v>

509
00:23:24.161 --> 00:23:26.260
<v Speaker 2>Is it not possible thAt we could for </v>
<v Speaker 2>start?</v>

510
00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:28.330
<v Speaker 2>They didn't do it properly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They ignored it.</v>

511
00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.490
<v Speaker 2>That's what everybody says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no one's ever done it properly.</v>

512
00:23:30.820 --> 00:23:32.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have more freedom today.</v>

513
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:35.500
<v Speaker 2>Human beings have more freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more freedom to behave,</v>

514
00:23:35.501 --> 00:23:40.501
<v Speaker 2>more freedom to communicate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more freedom to excel with this </v>

515
00:23:40.501 --> 00:23:43.471
<v Speaker 2>capitalist society that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>criticizing today than any human beings </v>

516
00:23:43.471 --> 00:23:43.471
<v Speaker 2>that have ever lived,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

517
00:23:43.471 --> 00:23:45.290
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of negatIve about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred percent,</v>

518
00:23:45.291 --> 00:23:50.291
<v Speaker 2>but it's also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of benefits and positive </v>

519
00:23:50.291 --> 00:23:50.291
<v Speaker 2>about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were a lot of soulless people that</v>

520
00:23:50.291 --> 00:23:54.581
<v Speaker 2>are just counting numbers and throwing </v>
<v Speaker 2>them on a hard drive somewhere and </v>

521
00:23:54.581 --> 00:23:54.581
<v Speaker 2>buying yachts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true too,</v>

522
00:23:54.581 --> 00:23:56.980
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean we shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>continue to evolve and inspiring.</v>

523
00:23:56.990 --> 00:24:01.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't think evolution is finished.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know there's loads of good things </v>

524
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:01.990
<v Speaker 2>about capitalism buffing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's carry on.</v>

525
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:03.350
<v Speaker 2>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What we can do is could we be doing this</v>

526
00:24:03.351 --> 00:24:04.760
<v Speaker 2>better or I believe that we could.</v>

527
00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:08.210
<v Speaker 2>I believe that this has taken us about </v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as it could go because of certain</v>

528
00:24:08.211 --> 00:24:13.211
<v Speaker 2>ecological imperatives in this spiritual</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing that you definitely mentioned that</v>

529
00:24:13.311 --> 00:24:16.940
<v Speaker 2>it's destroying the souls of a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and it's not necessary.</v>

530
00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:18.140
<v Speaker 2>When is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

531
00:24:18.141 --> 00:24:23.141
<v Speaker 2>the war we were promised in the fifties </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the technological revolution will </v>

532
00:24:23.141 --> 00:24:23.270
<v Speaker 2>mean you'll work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have an hour a day.</v>

533
00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:28.290
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they know when delivered on that </v>

534
00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:28.290
<v Speaker 2>and people just went,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

535
00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:30.640
<v Speaker 2>actually you carry on fucking work in </v>
<v Speaker 2>and we'll siphon the profit up hill and </v>

536
00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:34.190
<v Speaker 2>we could have leisure by societies buy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that as long as there is a form </v>

537
00:24:34.221 --> 00:24:39.221
<v Speaker 2>of centralized power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people at the center of that power will </v>

538
00:24:39.221 --> 00:24:40.310
<v Speaker 2>not share it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you have to go,</v>

539
00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:45.520
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this community is going to be run by </v>

540
00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:47.141
<v Speaker 2>those people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This community is going to be run by </v>

541
00:24:47.141 --> 00:24:49.181
<v Speaker 2>those people and that also solves a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the other problems that are defining </v>

542
00:24:49.181 --> 00:24:49.490
<v Speaker 2>our times of people seem to want </v>
<v Speaker 2>different things.</v>

543
00:24:49.490 --> 00:24:52.550
<v Speaker 2>Some people want to say absolutely no </v>
<v Speaker 2>homosexuality.</v>

544
00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:54.530
<v Speaker 2>Some people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want total sexual freedom.</v>

545
00:24:54.531 --> 00:24:59.531
<v Speaker 2>Some people want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want to live in what would be called </v>

546
00:24:59.531 --> 00:24:59.531
<v Speaker 2>a religious extreme way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people say atheist,</v>

547
00:24:59.531 --> 00:25:04.480
<v Speaker 2>well that can't exist under one banner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think any more problem with </v>

548
00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:08.021
<v Speaker 2>people saying no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Homosexuality is that they're deciding </v>

549
00:25:08.021 --> 00:25:11.180
<v Speaker 2>about freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other people's freedoms to exist for</v>

550
00:25:11.181 --> 00:25:15.410
<v Speaker 2>other people's freedoms to behave and to</v>
<v Speaker 2>express themselves the way they want to,</v>

551
00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:19.190
<v Speaker 2>and the real problem with that is a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the people that want to control other</v>

552
00:25:19.191 --> 00:25:21.020
<v Speaker 2>people's freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they really.</v>

553
00:25:21.021 --> 00:25:26.021
<v Speaker 2>The reason why they're doing is they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to suppress their own urges and </v>

554
00:25:26.021 --> 00:25:26.021
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

555
00:25:26.021 --> 00:25:29.980
<v Speaker 2>One of the things I'm most interested in</v>
<v Speaker 2>is how much of our activity is </v>

556
00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:31.370
<v Speaker 2>unconscious activity so much with doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

557
00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:36.400
<v Speaker 2>We don't know why we're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The book here that I'm promoting </v>

558
00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:36.660
<v Speaker 2>recovery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I written this book is my version of the</v>

559
00:25:36.661 --> 00:25:38.720
<v Speaker 2>12 steps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some of it last night we were in it.</v>

560
00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:43.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The 12 steps is a is a journey from </v>

561
00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.230
<v Speaker 2>unconsciousness to consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what essentially is unconsciously</v>

562
00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:50.320
<v Speaker 2>pursue pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You unconsciously pursue patterns </v>

563
00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:53.531
<v Speaker 2>because you don't know you're doing it </v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're a smack it or a crack head </v>

564
00:25:53.531 --> 00:25:56.351
<v Speaker 2>like me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eventually it gets you into such </v>

565
00:25:56.351 --> 00:25:56.351
<v Speaker 2>trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to address it,</v>

566
00:25:56.351 --> 00:26:00.430
<v Speaker 2>but most people hover along on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheese grater level lives of quiet </v>

567
00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:01.640
<v Speaker 2>desperation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never realizing,</v>

568
00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:03.860
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is possible to be happy.</v>

569
00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:06.740
<v Speaker 2>It is possible to be contented,</v>
<v Speaker 2>move towards nature,</v>

570
00:26:06.741 --> 00:26:08.450
<v Speaker 2>you while yourself doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can run.</v>

571
00:26:08.451 --> 00:26:10.490
<v Speaker 2>This is what I'm good at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is why I'm doing a note.</v>

572
00:26:10.491 --> 00:26:15.491
<v Speaker 2>The way you run your life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know they will know and telling you </v>

573
00:26:15.491 --> 00:26:15.491
<v Speaker 2>what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to compromise.</v>

574
00:26:15.491 --> 00:26:17.570
<v Speaker 2>You want to learn all of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>fascinating staff and fulfill yourself.</v>

575
00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:21.470
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you've created a road for yourself to</v>

576
00:26:21.471 --> 00:26:26.471
<v Speaker 2>do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not everybody can and more people </v>

577
00:26:26.471 --> 00:26:26.780
<v Speaker 2>could and I think there'll always be </v>
<v Speaker 2>resistance.</v>

578
00:26:26.781 --> 00:26:29.390
<v Speaker 2>They'll always be corrupting because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in me like I don't,</v>

579
00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:32.510
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't spend another second </v>
<v Speaker 2>condemning Donald Trump because I've got</v>

580
00:26:32.511 --> 00:26:35.930
<v Speaker 2>an arsenal in me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a greedy person that wants attention</v>

581
00:26:35.931 --> 00:26:39.350
<v Speaker 2>and wants people to love me and buy my </v>
<v Speaker 2>book and take care of my interests.</v>

582
00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.800
<v Speaker 2>You're introspective thinking has led </v>
<v Speaker 2>you to stop that path.</v>

583
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:44.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's essentially</v>

584
00:26:44.430 --> 00:26:49.430
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You saw the flaws and hedonistic </v>

585
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:51.891
<v Speaker 3>behavior and you hit the pause button </v>
<v Speaker 3>you thinking about and that's very </v>

586
00:26:51.891 --> 00:26:53.070
<v Speaker 3>attractive to people because we all see </v>
<v Speaker 3>that in ourselves.</v>

587
00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:56.430
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you talk about like what what I</v>

588
00:26:56.431 --> 00:27:01.431
<v Speaker 3>do and what I've done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most important thing that I've ever </v>

589
00:27:01.431 --> 00:27:01.431
<v Speaker 3>done is surround myself with people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love.</v>

590
00:27:01.431 --> 00:27:06.070
<v Speaker 3>Like I've a really good group of friends</v>
<v Speaker 3>and interesting people and that that </v>

591
00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.700
<v Speaker 3>leads to more like they find more </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting people.</v>

592
00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:12.780
<v Speaker 3>It branches out and spreads out and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>people listening to this,</v>

593
00:27:12.781 --> 00:27:16.560
<v Speaker 3>they become like minded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They pursue their happiness,</v>

594
00:27:16.830 --> 00:27:19.230
<v Speaker 3>they pursue their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their actual desires,</v>

595
00:27:19.231 --> 00:27:20.340
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what interests them,</v>

596
00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:21.360
<v Speaker 3>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

597
00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:23.790
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they would like to do for their,</v>

598
00:27:24.210 --> 00:27:25.820
<v Speaker 3>for their career,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for their life,</v>

599
00:27:25.821 --> 00:27:27.120
<v Speaker 3>for their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their craft.</v>

600
00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:30.150
<v Speaker 3>Like what do you enjoy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like find that thing.</v>

601
00:27:30.151 --> 00:27:32.220
<v Speaker 3>Surround yourself with likeminded </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

602
00:27:32.430 --> 00:27:37.430
<v Speaker 3>And I think we all get fuel from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that were around and it's one of </v>

603
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:41.271
<v Speaker 3>the most underrated aspects of being a </v>
<v Speaker 3>person in a community is if you're </v>

604
00:27:41.271 --> 00:27:44.370
<v Speaker 3>around a bunch of ambitious people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>are creative,</v>

605
00:27:44.371 --> 00:27:48.780
<v Speaker 3>who are open minded and honest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are inspired by that and you seek to</v>

606
00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:50.500
<v Speaker 3>have like likeminded thought.</v>

607
00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:51.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're right about that.</v>

608
00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:53.940
<v Speaker 4>I think that's another one in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>column,</v>

609
00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:56.840
<v Speaker 4>the against column for disappearing into</v>
<v Speaker 4>the cave.</v>

610
00:27:56.841 --> 00:27:59.050
<v Speaker 4>And being an hmi or a monkey or </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

611
00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:03.050
<v Speaker 4>because I heard someone say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we exist in dialectic,</v>

612
00:28:03.051 --> 00:28:05.960
<v Speaker 4>which means we exist in relationship and</v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation with one another.</v>

613
00:28:05.961 --> 00:28:10.961
<v Speaker 4>Who are you without other people?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'll nobody in it in an aluminium </v>

614
00:28:10.961 --> 00:28:13.390
<v Speaker 4>capsule floating through space.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does your personality match?</v>

615
00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:15.680
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're right about that,</v>

616
00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:20.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we exist in these relationships </v>

617
00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:22.811
<v Speaker 4>with one another.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I suppose what I have sought out is </v>

618
00:28:22.811 --> 00:28:23.960
<v Speaker 4>to connect with people on the level of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the damage,</v>

619
00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:26.470
<v Speaker 4>on the level of the wound,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the level of the vulnerability.</v>

620
00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:27.990
<v Speaker 4>Knowing a pessimistic that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

621
00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:30.620
<v Speaker 4>ring ourselves out into the gut away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

622
00:28:30.621 --> 00:28:35.621
<v Speaker 4>that's recognized that we're flawed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that together we can create </v>

623
00:28:35.621 --> 00:28:35.750
<v Speaker 4>supportive,</v>
<v Speaker 4>compassionate,</v>

624
00:28:36.020 --> 00:28:37.820
<v Speaker 4>loving communities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And for me,</v>

625
00:28:37.821 --> 00:28:42.821
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the stein point for that is a life that </v>

626
00:28:42.821 --> 00:28:46.361
<v Speaker 4>is predicated on spirituality as opposed</v>
<v Speaker 4>to materialism predicated on what my </v>

627
00:28:47.211 --> 00:28:52.211
<v Speaker 4>consciousness does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I stopped thinking what my </v>

628
00:28:52.211 --> 00:28:54.941
<v Speaker 4>consciousness does when I meditate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now I don't have the advantage of the </v>

629
00:28:54.941 --> 00:28:57.350
<v Speaker 4>dmt experiences in the ios got </v>
<v Speaker 4>fascinated by it,</v>

630
00:28:57.351 --> 00:29:00.530
<v Speaker 4>listened to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She tried kundalini because you do that</v>

631
00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:05.570
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever had any sort of </v>

632
00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:05.570
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic experience through doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>kundalini because the people that I know</v>

633
00:29:05.570 --> 00:29:09.801
<v Speaker 3>that are really into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they say that they can achieve people </v>

634
00:29:09.801 --> 00:29:12.891
<v Speaker 3>that I know that I've done dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll say they can achieve the same sort </v>

635
00:29:12.891 --> 00:29:12.900
<v Speaker 3>of states.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

636
00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:13.860
<v Speaker 3>With kundalini.</v>

637
00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:15.360
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're doing it well.</v>

638
00:29:15.420 --> 00:29:20.420
<v Speaker 4>Kundalini is one of the things I believe</v>
<v Speaker 4>in this particular toe at my finger by </v>

639
00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:21.480
<v Speaker 4>mark mahoney of shamrock tattoos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>los angeles.</v>

640
00:29:21.481 --> 00:29:26.481
<v Speaker 4>He's the kundalini serpent as drawn by </v>
<v Speaker 4>called young one of the great early </v>

641
00:29:26.481 --> 00:29:29.880
<v Speaker 4>figures of psychoanalysis,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the fire in the belly,</v>

642
00:29:29.890 --> 00:29:32.790
<v Speaker 4>the animal energy of survival,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the energy of creativity,</v>

643
00:29:33.090 --> 00:29:38.090
<v Speaker 4>the serpent energy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the reptile energy that's deep in our </v>

644
00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:38.090
<v Speaker 4>dna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When we were listened to,</v>

645
00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:42.291
<v Speaker 4>when we were creatures that crawled on </v>
<v Speaker 4>our belly and lives in a still can be </v>

646
00:29:42.291 --> 00:29:42.291
<v Speaker 4>the serpent,</v>

647
00:29:42.291 --> 00:29:45.370
<v Speaker 2>the snake within can become crowned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can become royal.</v>

648
00:29:45.371 --> 00:29:50.371
<v Speaker 2>Your animal desires can become royal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that the kundalini as I </v>

649
00:29:50.371 --> 00:29:51.880
<v Speaker 2>understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is about harnessing those energies,</v>

650
00:29:51.881 --> 00:29:54.280
<v Speaker 2>bringing it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd do like a yoga and I have.</v>

651
00:29:54.310 --> 00:29:56.620
<v Speaker 2>I do have pretty tripped how experiences</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I feel like,</v>

652
00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:57.850
<v Speaker 2>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm awake,</v>

653
00:29:57.851 --> 00:29:59.980
<v Speaker 2>but I am not me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am not my thoughts.</v>

654
00:29:59.981 --> 00:30:02.740
<v Speaker 2>I feel this sense of transcendence 90 </v>
<v Speaker 2>fold them retrospectively.</v>

655
00:30:02.741 --> 00:30:07.741
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the moment there's no me to register </v>

656
00:30:07.741 --> 00:30:07.741
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's only afterwards went,</v>

657
00:30:07.741 --> 00:30:07.990
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I lost myself there.</v>

658
00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:10.390
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel weird when you finger people</v>
<v Speaker 2>with that finger?</v>

659
00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.900
<v Speaker 2>Because it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

660
00:30:12.930 --> 00:30:16.900
<v Speaker 2>Don't send that snake in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to be honest,</v>

661
00:30:16.901 --> 00:30:21.160
<v Speaker 2>fingerings are less significant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My life finger is a very weird.</v>

662
00:30:21.161 --> 00:30:24.790
<v Speaker 2>It seems so rude in the expression </v>
<v Speaker 2>fingering.</v>

663
00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:27.100
<v Speaker 2>It's a dirty business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not functional.</v>

664
00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:32.140
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no need for it in the adult </v>

665
00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:32.140
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like it,</v>

666
00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:32.500
<v Speaker 2>it's not for a lot of people love it.</v>

667
00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:33.490
<v Speaker 2>People ask for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>

668
00:30:33.491 --> 00:30:38.260
<v Speaker 2>do not give them the snake combat </v>
<v Speaker 2>reptile.</v>

669
00:30:38.261 --> 00:30:39.790
<v Speaker 2>Right over open.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The shark was,</v>

670
00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:44.880
<v Speaker 2>is this the right moment to tell you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dreamt about you last night knowing </v>

671
00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:48.090
<v Speaker 2>it's a risk always to tell someone that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you dreamt about them because once it's </v>

672
00:30:48.090 --> 00:30:48.310
<v Speaker 2>out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's out there.</v>

673
00:30:48.311 --> 00:30:49.570
<v Speaker 2>So and particularly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

674
00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:52.120
<v Speaker 2>check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we were in this dream.</v>

675
00:30:52.121 --> 00:30:57.121
<v Speaker 2>We're in some sort of semi organic </v>
<v Speaker 2>forest type world,</v>

676
00:30:57.341 --> 00:31:02.341
<v Speaker 2>but they had an industrial component,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhat labyrinthian makers that </v>

677
00:31:02.341 --> 00:31:04.480
<v Speaker 2>component like that as if you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

678
00:31:04.481 --> 00:31:06.760
<v Speaker 2>he walks how they've made the most of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the woods,</v>

679
00:31:06.761 --> 00:31:08.620
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to build little huts and stuff and maybe</v>

680
00:31:08.621 --> 00:31:13.621
<v Speaker 2>they'll have a little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if the walks have another </v>

681
00:31:13.621 --> 00:31:13.621
<v Speaker 2>couple of thousand years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a little.</v>

682
00:31:13.621 --> 00:31:14.200
<v Speaker 2>He was trained.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what they would have done.</v>

683
00:31:14.230 --> 00:31:15.700
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were lovely,</v>

684
00:31:15.701 --> 00:31:16.630
<v Speaker 2>cuddly little guys.</v>

685
00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:18.040
<v Speaker 2>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a solvent.</v>

686
00:31:18.041 --> 00:31:23.041
<v Speaker 2>It is small industrial component to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were somewhere within that world and </v>

687
00:31:23.041 --> 00:31:25.900
<v Speaker 2>we were doing brazilian jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's used the word rolling.</v>

688
00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:31.260
<v Speaker 2>Now there was a sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is how we know is a dream cause </v>

689
00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:31.260
<v Speaker 2>there was a moment where I had you </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside control.</v>

690
00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:35.310
<v Speaker 2>Now from that moment I moved towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>choke and you did something where you </v>

691
00:31:35.310 --> 00:31:39.630
<v Speaker 2>arched and flipped over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very acrobatic and very elegantly don't </v>

692
00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:40.210
<v Speaker 2>even know if it's an actual move or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was very,</v>

693
00:31:40.211 --> 00:31:41.740
<v Speaker 2>very beautiful and a for ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>

694
00:31:41.741 --> 00:31:44.020
<v Speaker 2>This spa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going quite well this rolling,</v>

695
00:31:44.021 --> 00:31:48.070
<v Speaker 2>but it seems that joe rogan is better at</v>
<v Speaker 2>brazilian jujitsu than me,</v>

696
00:31:48.130 --> 00:31:53.130
<v Speaker 2>but that even in the dream world that </v>
<v Speaker 2>seemed like something kaiden </v>

697
00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:53.130
<v Speaker 2>understanding of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

698
00:31:53.130 --> 00:31:53.130
<v Speaker 2>there's</v>

699
00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:58.910
<v Speaker 3>so what's brilliant about it and what's </v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting about it is that the more </v>

700
00:31:58.910 --> 00:32:00.430
<v Speaker 3>time you put into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more you understand the moves,</v>

701
00:32:00.431 --> 00:32:03.340
<v Speaker 3>the more moves you require,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more moves you drill,</v>

702
00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:08.760
<v Speaker 3>the better you get at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more it's literally like a language </v>

703
00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:13.370
<v Speaker 3>and that as your vocabulary increases </v>
<v Speaker 3>and your ability to like.</v>

704
00:32:13.751 --> 00:32:17.230
<v Speaker 3>Even if your vocabulary is very broad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you don't talk a lot,</v>

705
00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:19.990
<v Speaker 3>he'd probably have stumbling </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations.</v>

706
00:32:19.991 --> 00:32:24.991
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you get used to talking all the </v>

707
00:32:24.991 --> 00:32:25.960
<v Speaker 3>time and you're having a conversation </v>
<v Speaker 3>with someone and the words kind of flow,</v>

708
00:32:25.961 --> 00:32:30.961
<v Speaker 3>but if you're talking to someone and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're weird and they bark out things </v>

709
00:32:30.961 --> 00:32:31.690
<v Speaker 3>and they talk over you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

710
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:33.190
<v Speaker 3>it's awkward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And herky jerky,</v>

711
00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:38.400
<v Speaker 3>much like jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu is almost like a Connecticut </v>

712
00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:39.710
<v Speaker 3>language,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there is a puzzle that's solved,</v>

713
00:32:39.711 --> 00:32:41.720
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's a problem,</v>

714
00:32:41.721 --> 00:32:42.860
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this person's.</v>

715
00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:46.880
<v Speaker 3>the problem is this person is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>apply all these different techniques,</v>

716
00:32:46.881 --> 00:32:51.881
<v Speaker 3>whether they're chokes or joint locks on</v>
<v Speaker 3>you and you are trying to both defend </v>

717
00:32:51.881 --> 00:32:54.140
<v Speaker 3>that and then put it on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You put yours on them.</v>

718
00:32:54.710 --> 00:32:56.170
<v Speaker 3>It's beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard you say before,</v>

719
00:32:56.180 --> 00:33:01.180
<v Speaker 3>high pressure problem solving or mma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always describe as high level problem </v>

720
00:33:03.111 --> 00:33:06.420
<v Speaker 3>solving with dire physical consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Physical clickers,</v>

721
00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:11.470
<v Speaker 3>mma is the most,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most high level of all the problem </v>

722
00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:13.070
<v Speaker 3>solving because there's the consequences</v>
<v Speaker 3>are so grave getting kicked in the head,</v>

723
00:33:13.071 --> 00:33:15.980
<v Speaker 3>getting elbowed and kneed like those </v>
<v Speaker 3>things are so.</v>

724
00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:21.640
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu I think is better for you for </v>
<v Speaker 3>sure physically because the consequences</v>

725
00:33:22.701 --> 00:33:24.350
<v Speaker 3>are not nearly as grave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get choked out,</v>

726
00:33:24.351 --> 00:33:25.970
<v Speaker 3>you're fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get your arm,</v>

727
00:33:26.190 --> 00:33:27.200
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you tap out.</v>

728
00:33:27.201 --> 00:33:27.980
<v Speaker 3>If your lungs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

729
00:33:27.981 --> 00:33:28.970
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have.</v>

730
00:33:29.210 --> 00:33:31.580
<v Speaker 3>As long as you're willing to tap out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to be willing to tap.</v>

731
00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:33.260
<v Speaker 3>Now you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll get through it.</v>

732
00:33:33.261 --> 00:33:34.370
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you get injured,</v>

733
00:33:34.371 --> 00:33:37.050
<v Speaker 3>you just get it fixed and take six </v>
<v Speaker 3>months off,</v>

734
00:33:37.051 --> 00:33:42.051
<v Speaker 3>she'll be back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like that connect language thing you </v>

735
00:33:42.051 --> 00:33:44.741
<v Speaker 3>said.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That really makes sense to me because I </v>

736
00:33:44.741 --> 00:33:44.741
<v Speaker 3>feel like when I'm doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not going.</v>

737
00:33:44.741 --> 00:33:45.130
<v Speaker 3>Hello?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

738
00:33:45.790 --> 00:33:50.790
<v Speaker 3>Show me the way to the train door door.</v>

739
00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:55.970
<v Speaker 3>People that are like punch me in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right direction.</v>

740
00:33:55.980 --> 00:34:00.560
<v Speaker 3>You go thousand ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why exactly do you watch jujitsu?</v>

741
00:34:00.561 --> 00:34:01.960
<v Speaker 3>It all online?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

742
00:34:01.970 --> 00:34:06.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't watch those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes I look at videos of named </v>

743
00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:06.970
<v Speaker 3>grace.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's or something and they're effortless</v>

744
00:34:06.970 --> 00:34:11.950
<v Speaker 3>capacities and charisma.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should watch just because you're </v>

745
00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:15.071
<v Speaker 3>enjoying it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Watch like current top of the food </v>

746
00:34:15.071 --> 00:34:15.520
<v Speaker 3>chain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jujitsu guys like hoffa mendez,</v>

747
00:34:15.521 --> 00:34:16.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watch some.</v>

748
00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:18.840
<v Speaker 3>Marcello garcia watched some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

749
00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:23.920
<v Speaker 3>some of the young guys coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gary tone and it's fascinating to watch </v>

750
00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:26.120
<v Speaker 3>them apply these new strategies to this </v>
<v Speaker 3>old language,</v>

751
00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:31.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because that's really essentially what </v>

752
00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:32.651
<v Speaker 3>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean what you're seeing is these new </v>

753
00:34:32.651 --> 00:34:33.110
<v Speaker 3>approaches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu is this never ending thing.</v>

754
00:34:33.490 --> 00:34:35.120
<v Speaker 3>I mean it really just doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't.</v>

755
00:34:35.150 --> 00:34:40.150
<v Speaker 3>The the like boxing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>although it's very complex and it </v>

756
00:34:40.150 --> 00:34:42.470
<v Speaker 3>doesn't seem as complex to someone on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the outside,</v>

757
00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:47.740
<v Speaker 3>but When you watch like a guy like floyd</v>
<v Speaker 3>mayweather or sugar ray leonard or </v>

758
00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:48.260
<v Speaker 3>someone who's just a master at their </v>
<v Speaker 3>craft,</v>

759
00:34:48.261 --> 00:34:50.450
<v Speaker 3>which you use see how complex it truly </v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

760
00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:53.750
<v Speaker 3>You see all the different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the all the different nuances to it,</v>

761
00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:55.310
<v Speaker 3>but it's still punching,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

762
00:34:55.311 --> 00:35:00.311
<v Speaker 3>There's just still too punching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas jujitsu is this fucking tangle </v>

763
00:35:00.311 --> 00:35:02.900
<v Speaker 3>of bodies and possibilities and </v>
<v Speaker 3>potential.</v>

764
00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:05.510
<v Speaker 3>There's so many different ways to </v>
<v Speaker 3>approach it.</v>

765
00:35:05.511 --> 00:35:08.360
<v Speaker 3>There's people that are chokers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's people that are armed lock guys.</v>

766
00:35:08.361 --> 00:35:10.370
<v Speaker 3>There's people that are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They like to get you with their legs,</v>

767
00:35:10.371 --> 00:35:15.371
<v Speaker 3>their triangle people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they all have their own little way </v>

768
00:35:15.371 --> 00:35:18.161
<v Speaker 3>of approaching this conversation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you've learned a few sort of </v>

769
00:35:18.161 --> 00:35:19.250
<v Speaker 3>grammatical pathways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fruit that kinetic language and think,</v>

770
00:35:19.251 --> 00:35:20.350
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to mf that.</v>

771
00:35:20.351 --> 00:35:23.030
<v Speaker 3>That particular area,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so watching videos online,</v>

772
00:35:23.031 --> 00:35:24.870
<v Speaker 3>it's like watching a video of Alan Watts</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking.</v>

773
00:35:24.890 --> 00:35:25.760
<v Speaker 3>You go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

774
00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:30.880
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>TerenCe mckenna or timothy leary or </v>

775
00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:34.361
<v Speaker 3>whoever it is that you think is </v>
<v Speaker 3>fascinating when you hear them talk and </v>

776
00:35:34.361 --> 00:35:36.260
<v Speaker 3>it develops new pathways and </v>
<v Speaker 3>possibilities for your own thinking.</v>

777
00:35:36.410 --> 00:35:37.960
<v Speaker 3>and it was one of the things I was gonna</v>
<v Speaker 3>say earlier though,</v>

778
00:35:37.961 --> 00:35:38.300
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>

779
00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:39.900
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I was thinking while we were having</v>

780
00:35:39.901 --> 00:35:44.901
<v Speaker 3>this conversation about the future and </v>
<v Speaker 3>about possibilities and about </v>

781
00:35:44.901 --> 00:35:48.380
<v Speaker 3>civilization that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with all due respect what you and I are </v>

782
00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:48.380
<v Speaker 3>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both of us were.</v>

783
00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:50.790
<v Speaker 3>This is a very rudimentary way of trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to figure this out.</v>

784
00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:51.720
<v Speaker 3>I think were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were,</v>

785
00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:54.200
<v Speaker 3>were clubbing at it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

786
00:35:54.930 --> 00:35:59.730
<v Speaker 3>and I think people are listening to this</v>
<v Speaker 3>that will do a far better job than us in</v>

787
00:35:59.731 --> 00:36:00.580
<v Speaker 3>the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

788
00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:03.390
<v Speaker 3>And I think that that's important and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that we're doing our best,</v>

789
00:36:03.391 --> 00:36:04.170
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're taking our tests,</v>

790
00:36:04.171 --> 00:36:09.171
<v Speaker 3>but when Henry Ford created the model t,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't intend it to race against the </v>

791
00:36:09.171 --> 00:36:09.540
<v Speaker 3>la ferrari.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

792
00:36:09.541 --> 00:36:11.430
<v Speaker 3>he didn't know what the fuck a la </v>
<v Speaker 3>ferrari was,</v>

793
00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:16.550
<v Speaker 3>but if he didn't make that model t the </v>
<v Speaker 3>la ferrari and wouldn't have been </v>

794
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.550
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>

795
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:17.640
<v Speaker 3>But you can't go back and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Henry Ford fucking suck,</v>

796
00:36:17.641 --> 00:36:22.641
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ride this piece of shit with its leaf </v>

797
00:36:22.641 --> 00:36:22.641
<v Speaker 3>springs at stupid tires,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

798
00:36:22.641 --> 00:36:26.160
<v Speaker 3>and then get into 2017 corvette zr one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You go,</v>

799
00:36:26.161 --> 00:36:27.150
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

800
00:36:27.151 --> 00:36:30.900
<v Speaker 3>this is where it's at now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like all these things have to be in</v>

801
00:36:30.901 --> 00:36:33.810
<v Speaker 3>place for the next evolution of it to </v>
<v Speaker 3>advance,</v>

802
00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:39.020
<v Speaker 3>and I think we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're looking at today with our society </v>

803
00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:39.960
<v Speaker 3>is we're hoping that there's a solution </v>
<v Speaker 3>out there were the,</v>

804
00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.360
<v Speaker 3>there is a solution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's god damn slow.</v>

805
00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:45.360
<v Speaker 3>Just like all evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's god damn slow.</v>

806
00:36:45.361 --> 00:36:48.900
<v Speaker 3>It's faster than single celled organisms</v>
<v Speaker 3>to a giraffe,</v>

807
00:36:49.230 --> 00:36:52.980
<v Speaker 3>but it's still fucking slow and we're a </v>
<v Speaker 3>part of it.</v>

808
00:36:53.010 --> 00:36:54.570
<v Speaker 3>All of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just you and I,</v>

809
00:36:54.571 --> 00:36:59.571
<v Speaker 3>but the people that are listening to </v>
<v Speaker 3>this and the people that are having </v>

810
00:36:59.571 --> 00:37:01.821
<v Speaker 3>their own podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their own conversations and doing ted </v>

811
00:37:01.821 --> 00:37:03.570
<v Speaker 3>talks and writing books.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all apart of thinking this out and</v>

812
00:37:03.571 --> 00:37:08.571
<v Speaker 3>these little pieces all fit together </v>
<v Speaker 3>slowly but surely and create this mosaic</v>

813
00:37:08.881 --> 00:37:13.881
<v Speaker 3>of ideas and potential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what we're experiencing now is just </v>

814
00:37:13.881 --> 00:37:18.141
<v Speaker 3>what we can experience in this realm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like in this world with this life that </v>

815
00:37:18.141 --> 00:37:22.341
<v Speaker 3>we're currently stuck in and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone 50 years from now we'll be </v>

816
00:37:22.561 --> 00:37:24.990
<v Speaker 3>looking back at our stumbling </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation,</v>

817
00:37:24.991 --> 00:37:29.991
<v Speaker 3>trying to figure out a way to engineer </v>
<v Speaker 3>society correctly and they'll have a </v>

818
00:37:29.991 --> 00:37:29.991
<v Speaker 3>much better way of doing it.</v>

819
00:37:29.991 --> 00:37:31.710
<v Speaker 4>I Think that's a very beautiful </v>
<v Speaker 4>progressive argument.</v>

820
00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:36.110
<v Speaker 4>I agree with much of what you've said </v>
<v Speaker 4>except some adequate joe.</v>

821
00:37:36.330 --> 00:37:41.330
<v Speaker 4>Even things I've heard on this podcast </v>
<v Speaker 4>say when you have graham hancock or a </v>

822
00:37:41.330 --> 00:37:45.560
<v Speaker 4>particularly intuitive when you got them</v>
<v Speaker 4>more sanctioned academic guy on there </v>

823
00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:46.810
<v Speaker 4>and they felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

824
00:37:46.850 --> 00:37:48.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you bastard.</v>

825
00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:51.290
<v Speaker 4>You're the people that I love that</v>

826
00:37:51.330 --> 00:37:52.290
<v Speaker 3>such a rebel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

827
00:37:52.291 --> 00:37:57.291
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fascinating to see these people </v>

828
00:37:57.291 --> 00:37:59.500
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>attacking him for his ideas and his </v>

829
00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:01.581
<v Speaker 3>research,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now having less and less ground </v>

830
00:38:01.581 --> 00:38:03.921
<v Speaker 3>stand on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Graham's ideas had been more proven in </v>

831
00:38:03.921 --> 00:38:05.100
<v Speaker 3>the last 10,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 years than ever before the case.</v>

832
00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:10.280
<v Speaker 3>Finding these new civilizations and </v>
<v Speaker 3>finding these new evidence that human </v>

833
00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:14.451
<v Speaker 3>beings have existed on this continent </v>
<v Speaker 3>far longer and that they're traveling </v>

834
00:38:14.451 --> 00:38:14.790
<v Speaker 3>all over the world for far longer and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the civilization,</v>

835
00:38:14.791 --> 00:38:16.070
<v Speaker 3>it's probably quite a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

836
00:38:16.190 --> 00:38:20.400
<v Speaker 4>Than we thought that's right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so we don't therefore know that this</v>

837
00:38:20.490 --> 00:38:24.990
<v Speaker 4>idea of continual progression,</v>
<v Speaker 4>linear progression is the only one.</v>

838
00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:29.310
<v Speaker 4>It is possible that when it comes to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>realm of consciousness,</v>

839
00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:34.670
<v Speaker 4>ancient people knew something that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>are struggling to understand that and I,</v>

840
00:38:35.881 --> 00:38:36.270
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

841
00:38:36.270 --> 00:38:41.270
<v Speaker 2>recognize that your model t to ferrari </v>
<v Speaker 2>metaphor is a good one and actually </v>

842
00:38:42.761 --> 00:38:47.761
<v Speaker 2>speaking to young people now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do feel that they're kind of more </v>

843
00:38:47.761 --> 00:38:47.761
<v Speaker 2>switched on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Geez,</v>

844
00:38:47.761 --> 00:38:51.670
<v Speaker 2>look at a baby With an ipad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems lIke they know already and,</v>

845
00:38:52.050 --> 00:38:53.500
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what I feel is,</v>

846
00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:55.660
<v Speaker 2>and this might just be my personal </v>
<v Speaker 2>narcissism,</v>

847
00:38:55.661 --> 00:38:58.720
<v Speaker 2>but I like to think of myself as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pinnacle of consciousness.</v>

848
00:38:58.721 --> 00:39:01.330
<v Speaker 2>That there isn't some other realm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even though god,</v>

849
00:39:01.331 --> 00:39:03.160
<v Speaker 2>I want that dmt so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

850
00:39:03.250 --> 00:39:05.200
<v Speaker 2>why are you afraid of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because it's not.</v>

851
00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:10.230
<v Speaker 2>It's not a like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not an intoxicant because I'm a 12 </v>

852
00:39:10.230 --> 00:39:12.380
<v Speaker 2>step guy and I'm a sobriety shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stop other 12 step that you're not going</v>

853
00:39:12.410 --> 00:39:16.060
<v Speaker 2>to fuckIng book about that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>promote.</v>

854
00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:21.480
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to fall slip addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not this idea that you're going to </v>

855
00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.320
<v Speaker 2>fall apart and become a junkie again.</v>

856
00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:28.320
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That part of her is that you can say </v>

857
00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:31.591
<v Speaker 2>that joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also a in an integral part of my </v>

858
00:39:31.591 --> 00:39:35.221
<v Speaker 2>recovery is the idea of surrender and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think that's an integral part of a lot </v>

859
00:39:35.221 --> 00:39:36.580
<v Speaker 2>of spiritual beliefs and internal part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of dmt.</v>

860
00:39:37.110 --> 00:39:39.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

861
00:39:39.161 --> 00:39:44.161
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but like to bypass the idea of my egoic </v>

00:39:44.161 --> 00:39:47.910
<v Speaker 2>offer ship my egoic or flurry of I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>russell and this is what I believe and </v>

863
00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:49.090
<v Speaker 2>this is what I'm going to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've surrendered to a way of life.</v>

864
00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:51.750
<v Speaker 2>I've surrendered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I can find some people with 25,</v>

865
00:39:51.751 --> 00:39:54.970
<v Speaker 2>thIrty years in recovery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>clean time that go.</v>

866
00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:58.430
<v Speaker 2>You're allowed to take the empty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like fucking hammered a pipe.</v>

867
00:39:58.450 --> 00:40:03.450
<v Speaker 2>You don't need there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There isn't a face or they're </v>

868
00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:03.450
<v Speaker 2>sanctioning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

869
00:40:03.450 --> 00:40:04.960
<v Speaker 2>in a way I learned by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't even need dmt.</v>

870
00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:06.130
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't need it,</v>

871
00:40:06.131 --> 00:40:07.270
<v Speaker 2>but you seem like you want it.</v>

872
00:40:07.450 --> 00:40:09.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I love the transcendent.</v>

873
00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:14.970
<v Speaker 2>I love it because I've know and I've </v>
<v Speaker 2>always known that this experience of </v>

874
00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:16.120
<v Speaker 2>being in a body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the conscious,</v>

875
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:21.150
<v Speaker 2>individualistic mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and remember I've taken loads of acid </v>

876
00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:21.760
<v Speaker 2>when I was a kid as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that this is not all of it.</v>

877
00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:26.790
<v Speaker 2>This is just we're just reading one </v>
<v Speaker 2>bandwidth of data with our century </v>

878
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:29.410
<v Speaker 2>instruments that there is limitless </v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness and limitless reality.</v>

879
00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:32.170
<v Speaker 2>Do you miss that asked experience?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

880
00:40:32.410 --> 00:40:33.170
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

881
00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:34.960
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

882
00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:39.990
<v Speaker 2>Is the concern that if you fell into it </v>
<v Speaker 2>like whether it was mushrooms or </v>

883
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:43.831
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you fell into that experience </v>

884
00:40:43.831 --> 00:40:46.711
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it would lead you in a downward </v>

885
00:40:46.711 --> 00:40:47.200
<v Speaker 2>spiral of addiction in a sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that in a sense,</v>

886
00:40:47.201 --> 00:40:52.201
<v Speaker 2>it's that and the fact is as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've turned my life around or my life </v>

887
00:40:52.201 --> 00:40:54.180
<v Speaker 2>has been turned around by this program,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by this system and like,</v>

888
00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:54.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

889
00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:56.590
<v Speaker 2>the 12 seven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does have something in it.</v>

890
00:40:56.590 --> 00:40:58.200
<v Speaker 2>That's quite what I want to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I said,</v>

891
00:40:58.210 --> 00:41:03.210
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ascetic is a little thing like it's </v>

892
00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:03.210
<v Speaker 2>about the nile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

893
00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:06.601
<v Speaker 2>Because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the reason that I've written this </v>

894
00:41:06.601 --> 00:41:06.601
<v Speaker 2>book was an interpretation to 12 steps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>

895
00:41:06.601 --> 00:41:11.070
<v Speaker 2>it's because I think it's a masterpiece </v>
<v Speaker 2>I think is a masterpiece at a time when </v>

896
00:41:11.070 --> 00:41:14.101
<v Speaker 2>people are struggling with ideologies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tIme when people are struggling with </v>

897
00:41:14.101 --> 00:41:15.940
<v Speaker 2>religion because the bad things about </v>
<v Speaker 2>religion is so obvious,</v>

898
00:41:15.941 --> 00:41:20.941
<v Speaker 2>the bigotry and the violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those things are so clear to us even </v>

899
00:41:20.941 --> 00:41:24.001
<v Speaker 2>though there are many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many beautiful things about islam and </v>

900
00:41:24.001 --> 00:41:24.330
<v Speaker 2>many beautiful things about christianity</v>
<v Speaker 2>are focused,</v>

901
00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:28.690
<v Speaker 2>tends to turn on the bigotry and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hatred that is present it or used out of</v>

902
00:41:28.691 --> 00:41:33.691
<v Speaker 2>those ideologies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The 12 steps is accessible to anybody </v>

903
00:41:33.691 --> 00:41:34.340
<v Speaker 2>and can be used</v>

904
00:41:34.340 --> 00:41:38.450
<v Speaker 4>as a code to unravel your connection to </v>
<v Speaker 4>your own individual experience,</v>

905
00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:41.000
<v Speaker 4>your own self centerdness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your own self obsession.</v>

906
00:41:41.001 --> 00:41:46.001
<v Speaker 4>Now this might not be a problem that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>have that this might be the line that </v>

907
00:41:46.001 --> 00:41:46.001
<v Speaker 4>separates us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Me,</v>

908
00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:50.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm self obsessed and I have the first </v>
<v Speaker 4>league like this is hoW it works.</v>

909
00:41:50.601 --> 00:41:55.601
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you admit there's something that you </v>

910
00:41:55.601 --> 00:41:55.601
<v Speaker 4>want to change and like that could be </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a smack head,</v>

911
00:41:55.601 --> 00:41:59.470
<v Speaker 4>pretty obvious then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or you're a sex addict and that's a </v>

912
00:41:59.470 --> 00:42:01.871
<v Speaker 4>harder thing to admit because it can be </v>
<v Speaker 4>rewarding if you're into adult human </v>

913
00:42:01.871 --> 00:42:05.111
<v Speaker 4>females in a culture like I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if he ultimately leaves you lonely </v>

914
00:42:05.111 --> 00:42:08.981
<v Speaker 4>and unable to have a family and you feel</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're having a negative emotional </v>

915
00:42:08.981 --> 00:42:11.090
<v Speaker 4>effect on others and yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you need to admit it's a problem.</v>

916
00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:14.990
<v Speaker 4>The secoNd thing is could your life be </v>
<v Speaker 4>better and the of course it could,</v>

917
00:42:14.991 --> 00:42:19.991
<v Speaker 4>and the third thing is being willing to </v>
<v Speaker 4>accept help from others and whether </v>

918
00:42:19.991 --> 00:42:22.580
<v Speaker 4>that's a community or from your </v>
<v Speaker 4>understanding of a higher power.</v>

919
00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:27.670
<v Speaker 4>Now I happen to have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe in god in the sense that I </v>

920
00:42:27.670 --> 00:42:30.881
<v Speaker 4>believe that there's limitless </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness that my individual </v>

921
00:42:30.881 --> 00:42:30.881
<v Speaker 4>consciousness is connected to something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that I can't understand,</v>

922
00:42:30.881 --> 00:42:33.020
<v Speaker 4>that no one can ever understand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>

923
00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:36.410
<v Speaker 4>as I've heard on one of my own podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as a matter of fact,</v>

924
00:42:36.411 --> 00:42:38.690
<v Speaker 4>yanis varoufakis who lived this </v>
<v Speaker 4>political movement in Greece.</v>

925
00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:41.300
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we will never know whether consciousness</v>

926
00:42:41.301 --> 00:42:46.301
<v Speaker 4>proceeded matter or matter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>proceeded consciousness and in a way </v>

927
00:42:46.301 --> 00:42:48.260
<v Speaker 4>it's irrelevant now because spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this quality is here.</v>

928
00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:51.920
<v Speaker 4>It's here and it's a big pile of what </v>
<v Speaker 4>human beings are and it isn't dealt with</v>

929
00:42:51.921 --> 00:42:55.550
<v Speaker 4>by consumerism and it isn't dealt with </v>
<v Speaker 4>by contemporary politics.</v>

930
00:42:55.551 --> 00:42:57.620
<v Speaker 4>People don't talk about love,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kindness,</v>

931
00:42:57.621 --> 00:43:00.380
<v Speaker 4>togetherness there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but these are the dominant things in our</v>

932
00:43:00.381 --> 00:43:01.940
<v Speaker 4>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's What's most important to me.</v>

933
00:43:01.941 --> 00:43:03.260
<v Speaker 4>The people that I love,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you said,</v>

934
00:43:03.261 --> 00:43:04.310
<v Speaker 4>the connections with the people.</v>

935
00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:09.310
<v Speaker 4>You have to become your reality,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a political system that reduces you </v>

936
00:43:09.350 --> 00:43:12.350
<v Speaker 4>to a component of an economic machine is</v>
<v Speaker 4>never going to fulfill you.</v>

937
00:43:12.351 --> 00:43:17.351
<v Speaker 4>So what I now believe is that by what I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think this book and do is give people a </v>

938
00:43:17.451 --> 00:43:22.451
<v Speaker 4>guide to reach in their own spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 4>truth because it's completely non </v>

939
00:43:22.451 --> 00:43:26.420
<v Speaker 4>prescriptive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like your version of god is going </v>

940
00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:28.571
<v Speaker 4>to be different from mine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your personal inventory that you draw </v>

941
00:43:28.571 --> 00:43:28.730
<v Speaker 4>up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we will reveal the truths of the way you</v>

942
00:43:28.731 --> 00:43:30.320
<v Speaker 4>see the world and the problems you've </v>
<v Speaker 4>made.</v>

943
00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:35.530
<v Speaker 4>The communIties that you belong to will </v>
<v Speaker 4>support you and you can change your </v>

944
00:43:35.530 --> 00:43:35.960
<v Speaker 4>patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can make amends for your past,</v>

945
00:43:35.961 --> 00:43:40.961
<v Speaker 4>you can continue to stay present,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and a vital part of this program is </v>

946
00:43:40.961 --> 00:43:44.321
<v Speaker 4>prayer and meditation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>continued connection to the moments you </v>

947
00:43:44.321 --> 00:43:45.260
<v Speaker 4>don't lose yourself in your past or the </v>
<v Speaker 4>projections of your future.</v>

948
00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:50.770
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether or not that prohibits me from </v>

949
00:43:50.770 --> 00:43:51.350
<v Speaker 4>experimenting with psychedelics in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>long term.</v>

950
00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:56.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for me the jury's out because I do want </v>

951
00:43:56.650 --> 00:43:56.650
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And bill wilson,</v>

952
00:43:56.650 --> 00:43:59.681
<v Speaker 4>the guy who founded these fellowships </v>
<v Speaker 4>was fascinated by asset and subsequent </v>

953
00:43:59.681 --> 00:44:03.310
<v Speaker 4>like even when he was so bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it took a lot of acid and I think that </v>

954
00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:03.310
<v Speaker 4>guy was a prophet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was on a mission.</v>

955
00:44:03.310 --> 00:44:06.420
<v Speaker 4>He was trying to discover what is truth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is reality?</v>

956
00:44:06.421 --> 00:44:10.850
<v Speaker 4>We discussed much in the 12 step program</v>
<v Speaker 4>though is because I think it's like most</v>

957
00:44:10.851 --> 00:44:12.410
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it becomes orthodox.</v>

958
00:44:12.411 --> 00:44:13.610
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like most religions,</v>

959
00:44:13.611 --> 00:44:18.611
<v Speaker 4>most systems in the end they become </v>
<v Speaker 4>orthodox and it does such a good job at </v>

960
00:44:18.611 --> 00:44:20.540
<v Speaker 4>helping with its primary purpose of </v>
<v Speaker 4>stopping people,</v>

961
00:44:20.541 --> 00:44:21.950
<v Speaker 4>being alcoholic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stopping people,</v>

962
00:44:21.951 --> 00:44:26.951
<v Speaker 4>being drug addicts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's such an amazing job and it's </v>

963
00:44:26.951 --> 00:44:26.951
<v Speaker 4>doing that job and it should continue to</v>
<v Speaker 4>do that job well.</v>

964
00:44:26.951 --> 00:44:31.640
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I wanted to do is extract </v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing that I think is amazing about </v>

965
00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:31.640
<v Speaker 4>it and say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my god,</v>

966
00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:36.560
<v Speaker 4>anyone could use this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you hear this again and again from </v>

967
00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:36.560
<v Speaker 4>people that have got long time pro clean</v>
<v Speaker 4>in these programs,</v>

968
00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:41.420
<v Speaker 4>everyone should work this program.</v>
<v Speaker 4>EveryoNe should know what is the impact </v>

969
00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:41.580
<v Speaker 4>cause your mom treated you tHat way or </v>
<v Speaker 4>your dad,</v>

970
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:44.430
<v Speaker 4>they saw associate at intuit score.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You were abused.</v>

971
00:44:44.570 --> 00:44:46.500
<v Speaker 4>You are still carrying it in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>consciousness.</v>

972
00:44:46.501 --> 00:44:48.000
<v Speaker 4>We've touched on it a moment ago,</v>
<v Speaker 4>joe,</v>

973
00:44:48.300 --> 00:44:53.300
<v Speaker 4>if you're like I say this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't choose between having a </v>

974
00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:56.301
<v Speaker 4>program and not having a program.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You choose between having a conscious </v>

975
00:44:56.301 --> 00:44:59.031
<v Speaker 4>program and an unconscious program.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're not working in a conscious </v>

976
00:44:59.031 --> 00:45:00.270
<v Speaker 4>program,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are being worked by your unconscious</v>

977
00:45:00.271 --> 00:45:01.560
<v Speaker 4>program.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what I do.</v>

978
00:45:01.561 --> 00:45:03.810
<v Speaker 4>If a man makes me feel intimidated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what I do.</v>

979
00:45:03.811 --> 00:45:05.550
<v Speaker 4>If a woman makes me feel like I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>important,</v>

980
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:08.070
<v Speaker 4>this is what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I have a bad day program,</v>

981
00:45:08.071 --> 00:45:08.940
<v Speaker 4>program,</v>
<v Speaker 4>program,</v>

982
00:45:08.941 --> 00:45:10.920
<v Speaker 4>the program of your class,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the program of your school,</v>

983
00:45:10.921 --> 00:45:12.000
<v Speaker 4>your family,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your culture,</v>

984
00:45:12.001 --> 00:45:17.001
<v Speaker 4>your time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this 12 step system can be buggy </v>

985
00:45:17.001 --> 00:45:18.090
<v Speaker 4>from it and it's not anybody else </v>
<v Speaker 4>telling you what to do because it's your</v>

986
00:45:18.091 --> 00:45:20.730
<v Speaker 4>own version of a higher power.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's your own version of a truth,</v>

987
00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:23.760
<v Speaker 4>except it's guided by the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>become free,</v>

988
00:45:23.790 --> 00:45:28.790
<v Speaker 4>connect to who you really are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and become benevolent and loving to </v>

989
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:28.790
<v Speaker 4>others.</v>

990
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:33.000
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it really important that you said </v>

991
00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.701
<v Speaker 3>earlier about there's no political </v>
<v Speaker 3>system or no,</v>

992
00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:40.040
<v Speaker 3>no politicians that are talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>love and values and caring and a sense </v>

993
00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:44.871
<v Speaker 3>of community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the solution to what </v>

994
00:45:44.871 --> 00:45:46.740
<v Speaker 3>we're fearing about brexit and Donald </v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump and the rise of,</v>

995
00:45:46.770 --> 00:45:51.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the just this attorney of the apple </v>

996
00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:51.770
<v Speaker 3>card,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

997
00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:55.380
<v Speaker 3>this thing that people are seeing right </v>
<v Speaker 3>now that they don't like and this,</v>

998
00:45:55.381 --> 00:45:56.070
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

999
00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:59.170
<v Speaker 3>the hateful rhetoric that people are </v>
<v Speaker 3>most disturbed about,</v>

1000
00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:00.420
<v Speaker 3>particularly with brexit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1001
00:46:00.421 --> 00:46:05.421
<v Speaker 3>That's like the big thing that people </v>
<v Speaker 3>are really disturbed about is that it </v>

1002
00:46:05.421 --> 00:46:05.880
<v Speaker 3>was fueled by this fear of the other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

1003
00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:10.900
<v Speaker 3>That's right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but isn't it possible that the when if </v>

1004
00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:12.330
<v Speaker 3>people decided that that didn't work </v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

1005
00:46:12.331 --> 00:46:17.331
<v Speaker 3>whether it's brexit or trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the response to that would be the </v>

1006
00:46:17.331 --> 00:46:21.471
<v Speaker 3>rise of this ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rise of someone who's going to talk </v>

1007
00:46:21.471 --> 00:46:23.580
<v Speaker 3>about love and community and someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>who's going to be genuine.</v>

1008
00:46:23.850 --> 00:46:26.730
<v Speaker 3>I mean we don't have that person now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't mean that that person can</v>

1009
00:46:26.731 --> 00:46:29.600
<v Speaker 3>exist and we've only had 45 different </v>
<v Speaker 3>presidents we had.</v>

1010
00:46:29.620 --> 00:46:34.620
<v Speaker 3>We haven't had any,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every single version of what's possible </v>

1011
00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:37.880
<v Speaker 3>for a human being to be interfacing with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the entire civilization of the United </v>

1012
00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:39.690
<v Speaker 3>States of America.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's pretty clear that what that</v>

1013
00:46:39.691 --> 00:46:44.691
<v Speaker 3>system delivers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that those power systems are </v>

1014
00:46:44.691 --> 00:46:44.760
<v Speaker 3>evolving in this direction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that this is,</v>

1015
00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:49.920
<v Speaker 3>if not the pinnacle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's possible that there are </v>

1016
00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:52.011
<v Speaker 3>better versions of a president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think that systems that at that </v>

1017
00:46:52.011 --> 00:46:52.110
<v Speaker 3>centralized will always deliver </v>
<v Speaker 3>inequality.</v>

1018
00:46:52.111 --> 00:46:55.560
<v Speaker 3>I think it's impossible for them not to </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that they should be evolved,</v>

1019
00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:57.450
<v Speaker 3>altered,</v>
<v Speaker 3>devolved in a in a sense,</v>

1020
00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:02.210
<v Speaker 4>but I do agree.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the things that in the I think is</v>

1021
00:47:02.211 --> 00:47:05.480
<v Speaker 4>positive about cataclysm in politics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if something like brexit,</v>

1022
00:47:05.570 --> 00:47:07.010
<v Speaker 4>when brexit happened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when trump happened,</v>

1023
00:47:07.011 --> 00:47:08.390
<v Speaker 4>I felt this sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a bit,</v>

1024
00:47:08.391 --> 00:47:11.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm eric know I'm a dharma mccormick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I live in mischief,</v>

1025
00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:15.140
<v Speaker 4>I live in the madness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's just behind reality and I've been</v>

1026
00:47:15.141 --> 00:47:16.340
<v Speaker 4>away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is good.</v>

1027
00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:19.790
<v Speaker 4>Not for the people's lives will be </v>
<v Speaker 4>negatively effective when we've seen the</v>

1028
00:47:19.791 --> 00:47:23.750
<v Speaker 4>rise of divisive politics and like kinda</v>
<v Speaker 4>softened quite old fashioned ideas about</v>

1029
00:47:23.751 --> 00:47:26.060
<v Speaker 4>sort of ethno nationalism and that kind </v>
<v Speaker 4>of stuff.</v>

1030
00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:28.670
<v Speaker 4>But the good thing is it precisely as </v>
<v Speaker 4>you say,</v>

1031
00:47:28.671 --> 00:47:33.671
<v Speaker 4>joe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it does open the conversation up </v>

1032
00:47:33.671 --> 00:47:33.671
<v Speaker 4>for someone to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1033
00:47:33.671 --> 00:47:37.230
<v Speaker 4>hold on a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we've just left out love </v>

1034
00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:37.230
<v Speaker 4>kindness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>unity,</v>

1035
00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:38.530
<v Speaker 4>togetherness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like these things perhaps people will be</v>

1036
00:47:38.531 --> 00:47:39.930
<v Speaker 4>open to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas I think if,</v>

1037
00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:41.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if we'd stayed in the european union,</v>

1038
00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:43.870
<v Speaker 4>if we'd had hillary clinton as </v>
<v Speaker 4>president,</v>

1039
00:47:43.900 --> 00:47:47.320
<v Speaker 4>things is a bit more business as usual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're not forced with.</v>

1040
00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:49.750
<v Speaker 4>We're not staring into the face of </v>
<v Speaker 4>madness.</v>

1041
00:47:49.751 --> 00:47:51.880
<v Speaker 4>We're not forced to address.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Things are going wrong.</v>

1042
00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:55.020
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I talked to my friends sturgeon,</v>

1043
00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:57.770
<v Speaker 3>a dental sturgill simpson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the musician.</v>

1044
00:47:58.070 --> 00:48:02.900
<v Speaker 3>He a brilliant musician and he sent me </v>
<v Speaker 3>this text message of a conversation that</v>

1045
00:48:02.910 --> 00:48:07.910
<v Speaker 3>he had with dr rick strassman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dr rick strassman as the guy out of the </v>

1046
00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:10.220
<v Speaker 3>university of New Mexico ran those </v>
<v Speaker 3>clinical tests on dmt,</v>

1047
00:48:10.221 --> 00:48:11.660
<v Speaker 3>wrote the book,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dmt,</v>

1048
00:48:11.661 --> 00:48:16.661
<v Speaker 3>the spirit molecule,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was quoting when he was talking </v>

1049
00:48:16.661 --> 00:48:18.320
<v Speaker 3>about the times that we live in and how </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up everything is.</v>

1050
00:48:18.350 --> 00:48:21.830
<v Speaker 3>He was quoting this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget,</v>

1051
00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:27.010
<v Speaker 3>I think it was a monk who said this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we are constantly in a fight </v>

1052
00:48:27.010 --> 00:48:31.120
<v Speaker 3>between 49 point nine percent and 50 </v>
<v Speaker 3>point one percent good and evil and that</v>

1053
00:48:34.491 --> 00:48:39.491
<v Speaker 3>they fluctuate back and forth and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>we feel like we are just like a speck of</v>

1054
00:48:42.201 --> 00:48:47.201
<v Speaker 3>dust because we are both a speck of dust</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the most important thing in the </v>

1055
00:48:48.381 --> 00:48:48.740
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>

1056
00:48:48.980 --> 00:48:53.980
<v Speaker 3>Because the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The actions of one individual literally </v>

1057
00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:55.460
<v Speaker 3>can influence the course of the human </v>
<v Speaker 3>race.</v>

1058
00:48:55.461 --> 00:49:00.461
<v Speaker 3>The course of our civilization and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>this period of flux is what creates </v>

1059
00:49:00.461 --> 00:49:03.200
<v Speaker 3>growth and change and that the tipping </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the apple cart and the.</v>

1060
00:49:03.201 --> 00:49:08.201
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the positive thing about having someone </v>

1061
00:49:08.201 --> 00:49:09.881
<v Speaker 3>like Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't like Donald Trump more than </v>

1062
00:49:09.881 --> 00:49:09.881
<v Speaker 3>I like hillary clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like either one of them,</v>

1063
00:49:10.050 --> 00:49:15.050
<v Speaker 3>hillary clinton represented to me was </v>
<v Speaker 3>this lifelong politician who didn't </v>

1064
00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:18.170
<v Speaker 3>support gay marriage until 2013,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which she was to me.</v>

1065
00:49:18.171 --> 00:49:20.570
<v Speaker 3>What she represented to me was an </v>
<v Speaker 3>obvious magician,</v>

1066
00:49:20.690 --> 00:49:25.690
<v Speaker 3>someone who I could see them pulling the</v>
<v Speaker 3>cards out on their sleeve and I'm </v>

1067
00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:29.321
<v Speaker 3>supposed to not pay attention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's bullshit and what he represents is </v>

1068
00:49:29.321 --> 00:49:33.851
<v Speaker 3>the ego unfettered in figuring out with </v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy hair and a family in the middle </v>

1069
00:49:35.210 --> 00:49:40.210
<v Speaker 3>sands and the whole deal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just this chaos ego putting his </v>

1070
00:49:40.210 --> 00:49:44.230
<v Speaker 3>name on buildings and then we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>realizing that both of these are </v>

1071
00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:44.230
<v Speaker 3>terrible options.</v>

1072
00:49:45.140 --> 00:49:47.880
<v Speaker 3>System is a terrible system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This way.</v>

1073
00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:52.910
<v Speaker 3>When we have what's essentially a </v>
<v Speaker 3>popularity contest to see who controls </v>

1074
00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:53.750
<v Speaker 3>nuclear weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's insane.</v>

1075
00:49:54.410 --> 00:49:59.410
<v Speaker 3>It's literally insane and that the only </v>
<v Speaker 3>way this is going to change is by having</v>

1076
00:49:59.421 --> 00:50:04.421
<v Speaker 3>this incredibly upsetting moment for </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody where they're looking around </v>

1077
00:50:04.421 --> 00:50:04.421
<v Speaker 3>going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is going on?</v>

1078
00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:09.730
<v Speaker 3>And then new ideas get introduced and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know what those new ideas are </v>

1079
00:50:10.191 --> 00:50:15.191
<v Speaker 3>going to be or who's going to introduce </v>
<v Speaker 3>them or how someone is gonna come along </v>

1080
00:50:15.191 --> 00:50:19.871
<v Speaker 3>within the next three years and </v>
<v Speaker 3>challenge this current system in a way </v>

1081
00:50:19.871 --> 00:50:22.820
<v Speaker 3>that's appealing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not just to the right and to the left,</v>

1082
00:50:22.821 --> 00:50:26.120
<v Speaker 3>but maybe in some way to just human </v>
<v Speaker 3>beings.</v>

1083
00:50:26.180 --> 00:50:31.180
<v Speaker 3>Maybe in some way human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 3>They realize like what's what's we're </v>

1084
00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:34.551
<v Speaker 3>not going to get by in this world by </v>
<v Speaker 3>enforcing right wing politics and ideas </v>

1085
00:50:35.241 --> 00:50:40.241
<v Speaker 3>and and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this sort of ideology or left wing </v>

1086
00:50:40.241 --> 00:50:44.140
<v Speaker 3>ideas and politics ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but freedom and love and community and </v>

1087
00:50:44.870 --> 00:50:48.410
<v Speaker 3>to be free to practice your own level of</v>
<v Speaker 3>conservatism on your own.</v>

1088
00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:53.520
<v Speaker 3>But the idea that I don't want any gays </v>
<v Speaker 3>and want to have a little tribe were no </v>

1089
00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:54.440
<v Speaker 3>gays are allowed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That seems to me to be counterproductive</v>

1090
00:50:54.441 --> 00:50:56.440
<v Speaker 3>and that seems to be the counter </v>
<v Speaker 3>revolutionary.</v>

1091
00:50:57.060 --> 00:51:02.060
<v Speaker 3>All of that idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Any suppressing of people's individual </v>

1092
00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:02.060
<v Speaker 3>right to express themselves.</v>

1093
00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:06.710
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree with almost everything you said </v>

1094
00:51:06.710 --> 00:51:07.330
<v Speaker 4>there and I've got a sense of been </v>
<v Speaker 4>involved in academia.</v>

1095
00:51:07.331 --> 00:51:09.120
<v Speaker 4>Do you know one of the main changes or </v>
<v Speaker 4>make notes?</v>

1096
00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:10.190
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1097
00:51:10.250 --> 00:51:11.420
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Notes now.</v>

1098
00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:13.800
<v Speaker 4>I never would have dreamt to that when I</v>
<v Speaker 4>was a younger man.</v>

1099
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:15.450
<v Speaker 4>Excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Native beginning.</v>

1100
00:51:15.480 --> 00:51:16.930
<v Speaker 4>You talked about this idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fitbit,</v>

1101
00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:18.170
<v Speaker 4>the percent aisle,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1102
00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:23.240
<v Speaker 4>good and evil that couldn't even now </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a great quote by the rational </v>

1103
00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:24.660
<v Speaker 4>for sultanates and the line between good</v>
<v Speaker 4>and evil runs not between creeds,</v>

1104
00:51:24.661 --> 00:51:27.690
<v Speaker 4>religions and empires,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but through every human heart.</v>

1105
00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:33.000
<v Speaker 4>So nice quote for that quote now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's a personal theory that the </v>

1106
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:37.310
<v Speaker 4>reason that I dollar tree is bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they becomes like an in most </v>

1107
00:51:37.310 --> 00:51:40.641
<v Speaker 4>religions say don't worship individuals </v>
<v Speaker 4>is precisely because they understand </v>

1108
00:51:40.641 --> 00:51:42.960
<v Speaker 4>that don't make one individual have too </v>
<v Speaker 4>much power.</v>

1109
00:51:43.170 --> 00:51:48.170
<v Speaker 4>Even now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>historically we know that gandy had </v>

1110
00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:48.170
<v Speaker 4>skeletons in the closet.</v>

1111
00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:48.170
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Great gandy,</v>

1112
00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:52.690
<v Speaker 4>wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Great hero of bringing down the british </v>

1113
00:51:52.690 --> 00:51:52.690
<v Speaker 4>empire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bringing it about freedom and love.</v>

1114
00:51:52.690 --> 00:51:57.590
<v Speaker 4>Interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gandy said there's no point ass kicking </v>

1115
00:51:57.590 --> 00:51:58.110
<v Speaker 4>the british out of India and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>replicate in their systems.</v>

1116
00:51:58.111 --> 00:52:00.180
<v Speaker 4>This is a country of 70,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>villages.</v>

1117
00:52:00.181 --> 00:52:05.181
<v Speaker 4>These 70,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>visitors villages are or should be </v>

1118
00:52:05.181 --> 00:52:06.540
<v Speaker 4>autonomous run on their own craft or </v>
<v Speaker 4>craft economies,</v>

1119
00:52:06.541 --> 00:52:11.541
<v Speaker 4>trade with one another only in access,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so like he was trying to get like </v>

1120
00:52:11.541 --> 00:52:12.350
<v Speaker 4>important ideas out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like,</v>

1121
00:52:12.450 --> 00:52:14.790
<v Speaker 4>like your great civil rights leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 4>malcolm x,</v>

1122
00:52:14.850 --> 00:52:16.870
<v Speaker 4>martin luther king,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these are men that had flow.</v>

1123
00:52:16.880 --> 00:52:19.740
<v Speaker 4>Malcolm x did prison time for unusual </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit,</v>

1124
00:52:20.090 --> 00:52:21.450
<v Speaker 4>but Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 4>King,</v>

1125
00:52:21.490 --> 00:52:23.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>extra marrow of stuff.</v>

1126
00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:25.930
<v Speaker 4>People are not perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're great hero.</v>

1127
00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:29.520
<v Speaker 4>Pioneer people are people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we have to change this.</v>

1128
00:52:29.610 --> 00:52:34.610
<v Speaker 4>What I think is is that we can't have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>popularity contest to decide who's in </v>

1129
00:52:34.610 --> 00:52:35.370
<v Speaker 4>charge of nuclear weapons.</v>

1130
00:52:35.400 --> 00:52:38.430
<v Speaker 4>These kinds of systems need to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>devolved because it's mental.</v>

1131
00:52:38.431 --> 00:52:39.340
<v Speaker 4>We know that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

1132
00:52:39.350 --> 00:52:42.900
<v Speaker 4>I agree with your analysis of hillary </v>
<v Speaker 4>clinton and Donald Trump entirely.</v>

1133
00:52:42.901 --> 00:52:47.901
<v Speaker 4>I think that the reason that you have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>mad option like Donald Trump being </v>

1134
00:52:47.901 --> 00:52:48.660
<v Speaker 4>successful,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's when people had had enough of those</v>

1135
00:52:48.661 --> 00:52:51.660
<v Speaker 4>cheap tricks and cards up sleeves and </v>
<v Speaker 4>financial corruption.</v>

1136
00:52:51.780 --> 00:52:55.320
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the apple carts going over chaos too.</v>

1137
00:52:55.321 --> 00:52:57.900
<v Speaker 4>I agree,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is an important part of evolution.</v>

1138
00:52:57.901 --> 00:53:00.990
<v Speaker 4>We rest on chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These patterns that we observe,</v>

1139
00:53:01.030 --> 00:53:06.030
<v Speaker 4>just temporary or show their sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>cult leader and sort of poetic figure </v>

1140
00:53:07.230 --> 00:53:12.230
<v Speaker 4>leader said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we talk about civilization as if it's </v>

1141
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:15.981
<v Speaker 4>this great thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is civilization a clearing in the </v>

1142
00:53:15.981 --> 00:53:15.981
<v Speaker 4>forest?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1143
00:53:15.981 --> 00:53:18.720
<v Speaker 4>for a moment we create our cities in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>forest closes in and has it again.</v>

1144
00:53:18.930 --> 00:53:22.350
<v Speaker 4>We're all theSe ancient civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Graham hancock talked about,</v>

1145
00:53:22.351 --> 00:53:24.370
<v Speaker 4>so lucidly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where are they now?</v>

1146
00:53:25.170 --> 00:53:26.520
<v Speaker 4>It up by the amazon</v>

1147
00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:31.320
<v Speaker 2>and I think great quote in a herman </v>
<v Speaker 2>melville's moby dick that says,</v>

1148
00:53:31.460 --> 00:53:33.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>noah's flood is still happening.</v>

1149
00:53:33.811 --> 00:53:38.811
<v Speaker 2>We are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The majority of the earth is still </v>

1150
00:53:38.811 --> 00:53:38.811
<v Speaker 2>flooded in war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>

1151
00:53:38.811 --> 00:53:41.670
<v Speaker 2>we are connected to these events.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are out there in that chaos.</v>

1152
00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:43.320
<v Speaker 2>So I suppose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gosh,</v>

1153
00:53:43.321 --> 00:53:45.450
<v Speaker 2>what I'm trying to say here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joe,</v>

1154
00:53:45.750 --> 00:53:48.180
<v Speaker 2>is that when we recognize that we're all</v>
<v Speaker 2>flawed,</v>

1155
00:53:48.210 --> 00:53:50.250
<v Speaker 2>that we're all fallible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to sort of thing.</v>

1156
00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:55.420
<v Speaker 2>We have to think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how can we build systems that tend </v>

1157
00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:55.620
<v Speaker 2>towards the better aspects of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>nature,</v>

1158
00:53:55.650 --> 00:54:00.650
<v Speaker 2>not the worst aspects of our nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we recognize that any politician in </v>

1159
00:54:00.650 --> 00:54:02.340
<v Speaker 2>a position of power for too long we will</v>
<v Speaker 2>make mistakes,</v>

1160
00:54:02.370 --> 00:54:07.370
<v Speaker 2>will be floored.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That power has to be spread out as much </v>

1161
00:54:07.370 --> 00:54:09.810
<v Speaker 2>as possible and as close to the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it affects as as is feasible.</v>

1162
00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:11.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's always going to be an issue with</v>

1163
00:54:11.821 --> 00:54:15.540
<v Speaker 2>someone being able to acquire </v>
<v Speaker 2>$100,000,000,000</v>

1164
00:54:15.541 --> 00:54:18.710
<v Speaker 2>like the amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeff Bezos guy like that,</v>

1165
00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:21.550
<v Speaker 2>that is going to corrupt people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

1166
00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:23.280
<v Speaker 2>why would you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

1167
00:54:23.281 --> 00:54:28.281
<v Speaker 2>why would you keep working?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you want that amount of money </v>

1168
00:54:28.281 --> 00:54:28.281
<v Speaker 2>and what's your plan?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's your end game?</v>

1169
00:54:28.281 --> 00:54:28.650
<v Speaker 2>You're trying to make the world a better</v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

1170
00:54:28.651 --> 00:54:32.460
<v Speaker 2>You're going to try to acquire more </v>
<v Speaker 2>brown boxes with your logo on them.</v>

1171
00:54:32.810 --> 00:54:33.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you.</v>

1172
00:54:33.330 --> 00:54:33.930
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>

1173
00:54:34.290 --> 00:54:35.380
<v Speaker 3>Where's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where's it going?</v>

1174
00:54:35.470 --> 00:54:37.630
<v Speaker 3>And it seems to me that there's a game,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1175
00:54:37.631 --> 00:54:40.480
<v Speaker 3>Everybody plays this game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people play it for $10 an hour.</v>

1176
00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:45.600
<v Speaker 3>Some people play it for $10,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>a year and that once you make </v>

1177
00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:45.600
<v Speaker 3>$10,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>a year,</v>

1178
00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:48.130
<v Speaker 3>you want infinite growth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want 11 next year?</v>

1179
00:54:48.131 --> 00:54:53.131
<v Speaker 3>I would like to tell my stockholders </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we have caused to celebrate and we </v>

1180
00:54:53.290 --> 00:54:55.450
<v Speaker 3>have 20 percent increase in our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1181
00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:57.310
<v Speaker 3>bottom line this year and everybody's </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking good.</v>

1182
00:54:57.340 --> 00:54:59.450
<v Speaker 3>Let's go to tahiti.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1183
00:54:59.530 --> 00:55:01.090
<v Speaker 3>And then like where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>

1184
00:55:01.150 --> 00:55:03.310
<v Speaker 3>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not going to last.</v>

1185
00:55:03.311 --> 00:55:04.720
<v Speaker 3>You're not going to live forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>

1186
00:55:04.990 --> 00:55:06.030
<v Speaker 3>What is the end game?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1187
00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:08.260
<v Speaker 3>there's no end game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're caught up in the current game,</v>

1188
00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:10.330
<v Speaker 3>in the current game.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are literally,</v>

1189
00:55:10.331 --> 00:55:15.331
<v Speaker 3>capitalists are literally living in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>moment because you have to just </v>

1190
00:55:15.331 --> 00:55:19.360
<v Speaker 3>stockpiling shit that they're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about the overall objective,</v>

1191
00:55:19.390 --> 00:55:22.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a sky down looking from the,</v>

1192
00:55:22.331 --> 00:55:23.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking from the heavens</v>

1193
00:55:23.830 --> 00:55:25.330
<v Speaker 2>down on earth like what the fuck are we </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing?</v>

1194
00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:30.360
<v Speaker 2>They're not thinking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nor are they accepting that limitless </v>

1195
00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:33.271
<v Speaker 2>growth is literally impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That we have finite resources on a </v>

1196
00:55:33.271 --> 00:55:33.430
<v Speaker 2>finite planet,</v>

1197
00:55:34.250 --> 00:55:39.250
<v Speaker 3>not for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also you get caught up in the </v>

1198
00:55:39.411 --> 00:55:41.810
<v Speaker 3>momentum of whatever you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1199
00:55:41.811 --> 00:55:46.811
<v Speaker 3>whatever you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just get caught up in it and you </v>

1200
00:55:46.811 --> 00:55:46.811
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1201
00:55:46.811 --> 00:55:47.930
<v Speaker 3>If you're doing something and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to get better at it,</v>

1202
00:55:47.931 --> 00:55:52.931
<v Speaker 3>whether it's make a better paintings or </v>
<v Speaker 3>acquire more wealth like you these </v>

1203
00:55:53.620 --> 00:55:56.840
<v Speaker 3>requests and you try to get better at </v>
<v Speaker 3>these quests,</v>

1204
00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:57.500
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's,</v>

1205
00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:02.520
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a real issue with human beings </v>

1206
00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:03.650
<v Speaker 3>and I think it has evolutionary roots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it has roots in our,</v>

1207
00:56:03.890 --> 00:56:08.890
<v Speaker 3>our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our need and desire to make better </v>

1208
00:56:08.890 --> 00:56:09.230
<v Speaker 3>structures and shelters to make better </v>
<v Speaker 3>weapons,</v>

1209
00:56:09.231 --> 00:56:14.231
<v Speaker 3>to make a better civilization so that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>can stay alive longer so that we can </v>

1210
00:56:14.231 --> 00:56:15.230
<v Speaker 3>ensure that our children will be alive </v>
<v Speaker 3>longer.</v>

1211
00:56:15.590 --> 00:56:20.590
<v Speaker 3>I think there's roots in that that are </v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of just sort of bastardized and </v>

1212
00:56:21.081 --> 00:56:26.081
<v Speaker 3>twisted in this world of ideas where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where you're talking about like money </v>

1213
00:56:26.081 --> 00:56:30.691
<v Speaker 3>and and and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and stocks and bonds and mutual funds </v>

1214
00:56:30.691 --> 00:56:33.160
<v Speaker 3>and hedge funds and it's like jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's,</v>

1215
00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:36.950
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like we have these ancient </v>
<v Speaker 3>instincts for,</v>

1216
00:56:36.990 --> 00:56:39.960
<v Speaker 3>for constant improvement that just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

1217
00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:43.050
<v Speaker 3>these human reward systems get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just get corrupt.</v>

1218
00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:48.100
<v Speaker 4>Did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My theory on this idea is that we have </v>

1219
00:56:48.411 --> 00:56:50.810
<v Speaker 4>biochemical drives,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as you've just described,</v>

1220
00:56:50.840 --> 00:56:54.680
<v Speaker 4>that compel us to move forward and to </v>
<v Speaker 4>survive.</v>

1221
00:56:54.860 --> 00:56:59.150
<v Speaker 4>But we also have a culture that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>continually stimulate in fear and desire</v>

1222
00:56:59.330 --> 00:57:04.160
<v Speaker 4>in order to cost us in a particular </v>
<v Speaker 4>economic role that have consumer.</v>

1223
00:57:04.430 --> 00:57:09.430
<v Speaker 4>And the reason that I believe that this </v>
<v Speaker 4>program and indeed this book are </v>

1224
00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:14.381
<v Speaker 4>important,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is because it is a code to awakening a </v>

1225
00:57:14.381 --> 00:57:16.970
<v Speaker 4>code to becoming conscious and once you </v>
<v Speaker 4>are conscious you aren't beholden to the</v>

1226
00:57:16.971 --> 00:57:21.971
<v Speaker 4>same systems.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So much of our behAvior is a result of </v>

1227
00:57:21.971 --> 00:57:23.090
<v Speaker 4>what we don't know about ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We are motivated.</v>

1228
00:57:23.330 --> 00:57:28.330
<v Speaker 4>we're trying to fulfill ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 4>because there is that biochemical </v>

1229
00:57:28.330 --> 00:57:31.811
<v Speaker 4>imperative to get more to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which as an addict I experienced and </v>

1230
00:57:31.811 --> 00:57:33.180
<v Speaker 4>have experienced an extreme sex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sex,</v>

1231
00:57:33.181 --> 00:57:33.710
<v Speaker 4>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sex,</v>

1232
00:57:33.711 --> 00:57:38.711
<v Speaker 4>sex till.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no more getting out of my head </v>

1233
00:57:38.711 --> 00:57:41.141
<v Speaker 4>till it's inconceivable that I could do </v>
<v Speaker 4>that anymore without killing myself a </v>

1234
00:57:41.141 --> 00:57:43.100
<v Speaker 4>one in status and power and prestige.</v>

1235
00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:48.100
<v Speaker 4>And see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reason that I think this system </v>

1236
00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:48.470
<v Speaker 4>works outside of addiction in it's as </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's currently recognized is I've had to</v>

1237
00:57:48.471 --> 00:57:50.900
<v Speaker 4>work in all sorts of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once I got rid of drugs,</v>

1238
00:57:50.901 --> 00:57:52.430
<v Speaker 4>I got obsessed with sex.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once I get,</v>

1239
00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:57.520
<v Speaker 4>once I get a handle on sex,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've stopped being obsessed with what </v>

1240
00:57:57.520 --> 00:57:57.520
<v Speaker 4>other people think of me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Power,</v>

1241
00:57:57.520 --> 00:58:02.170
<v Speaker 4>fame and money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and what I'm continually recognizing is </v>

1242
00:58:02.170 --> 00:58:05.171
<v Speaker 4>none of these things can be fulfilling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're not connected to who you </v>

1243
00:58:05.171 --> 00:58:05.171
<v Speaker 4>really are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that can give you a moment.</v>

1244
00:58:05.171 --> 00:58:09.881
<v Speaker 4>Then you're free to pursue your art or </v>
<v Speaker 4>your creation of structures in a </v>

1245
00:58:09.881 --> 00:58:14.591
<v Speaker 4>conscious way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not doing it because you feel </v>

1246
00:58:14.591 --> 00:58:15.740
<v Speaker 4>unconsciously a bit worthless or a bit </v>
<v Speaker 4>crap or like it might fulfill you.</v>

1247
00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:17.400
<v Speaker 4>It becomes pragmatic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eric,</v>

1248
00:58:17.470 --> 00:58:21.070
<v Speaker 3>do you also feel that like less </v>
<v Speaker 3>concentrating on yourself and less being</v>

1249
00:58:21.071 --> 00:58:26.071
<v Speaker 3>self obsessed is allowed you to have </v>
<v Speaker 3>more open communication with other </v>

1250
00:58:26.071 --> 00:58:28.870
<v Speaker 3>people and more healthy like back and </v>
<v Speaker 3>forth,</v>

1251
00:58:28.871 --> 00:58:30.490
<v Speaker 3>fulfilling communication with other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1252
00:58:30.491 --> 00:58:35.491
<v Speaker 3>which literally makes you happier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas you thought that being obsessed </v>

1253
00:58:35.491 --> 00:58:39.181
<v Speaker 3>with yourself and being obsessed with </v>
<v Speaker 3>success and adulation and or sex or </v>

1254
00:58:39.761 --> 00:58:44.761
<v Speaker 3>whatever those other things were that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you were obsessed with was going to </v>

1255
00:58:44.761 --> 00:58:47.161
<v Speaker 3>fulfill those needs and they weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that community and bonding and </v>

1256
00:58:47.590 --> 00:58:49.450
<v Speaker 3>that's a big part of jujitsu as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1257
00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:50.560
<v Speaker 3>So I think part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1258
00:58:50.570 --> 00:58:51.400
<v Speaker 3>big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big,</v>

1259
00:58:51.401 --> 00:58:52.600
<v Speaker 3>big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big part of jujitsu.</v>

1260
00:58:52.601 --> 00:58:55.210
<v Speaker 3>It's like we're a family when you're in </v>
<v Speaker 3>there choking each other,</v>

1261
00:58:55.211 --> 00:58:59.980
<v Speaker 3>as weird as that sounds like there's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a bond between those people that</v>

1262
00:58:59.981 --> 00:59:01.870
<v Speaker 3>are in those classes all over the world </v>
<v Speaker 3>that are.</v>

1263
00:59:01.890 --> 00:59:03.260
<v Speaker 3>They're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They they,</v>

1264
00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:08.470
<v Speaker 3>they recognize this community in that as</v>
<v Speaker 3>well as it being an extreme pursuit and </v>

1265
00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:12.190
<v Speaker 3>as well as it being something that is </v>
<v Speaker 3>developing your human potential,</v>

1266
00:59:12.490 --> 00:59:14.890
<v Speaker 3>you're also.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're also creating this really intense</v>

1267
00:59:14.891 --> 00:59:17.830
<v Speaker 3>community of likeminded people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Comedians feel that.</v>

1268
00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:23.150
<v Speaker 3>I definitely feel that with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel that with most comedians that </v>

1269
00:59:23.150 --> 00:59:24.860
<v Speaker 3>come in here and I know what you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are the same thing in a lot of ways.</v>

1270
00:59:25.110 --> 00:59:25.870
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1271
00:59:25.871 --> 00:59:30.871
<v Speaker 4>I think that's very important and in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>way it's a return to what you were </v>

1272
00:59:30.871 --> 00:59:33.931
<v Speaker 4>saying at the beginning of our </v>
<v Speaker 4>conversation that there are certain </v>

1273
00:59:33.931 --> 00:59:37.171
<v Speaker 4>anthropology core requirements that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>need to feel lIke you're part of a </v>

1274
00:59:37.171 --> 00:59:41.701
<v Speaker 4>tribe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need to feel connected to one </v>

1275
00:59:41.701 --> 00:59:44.161
<v Speaker 4>another and in my very limited pop in </v>
<v Speaker 4>there once a week experiences of bjj </v>

1276
00:59:45.010 --> 00:59:50.010
<v Speaker 4>when I've done classes with other people</v>
<v Speaker 4>instead of just the one on one with the </v>

1277
00:59:50.010 --> 00:59:50.510
<v Speaker 4>instructor because he looks after me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1278
00:59:50.511 --> 00:59:52.330
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's delicate because he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>brilliant,</v>

1279
00:59:52.331 --> 00:59:55.390
<v Speaker 4>but when it's with like other people </v>
<v Speaker 4>that are similar beginner level,</v>

1280
00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:58.330
<v Speaker 4>there's moments of real intensity within</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1281
00:59:58.331 --> 01:00:03.331
<v Speaker 4>but afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a sense of fraternity and love and </v>

1282
01:00:03.331 --> 01:00:05.560
<v Speaker 4>closeness and like some stuff that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>not familiar with have not used to being</v>

1283
01:00:05.561 --> 01:00:10.561
<v Speaker 4>close to men in that kind of way and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's amazing and beautiful and probably </v>

1284
01:00:10.561 --> 01:00:14.851
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very natural and impute important side </v>

1285
01:00:14.851 --> 01:00:18.630
<v Speaker 4>of my life that I didn't explore because</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did download the myth of our time that</v>

1286
01:00:18.911 --> 01:00:23.911
<v Speaker 4>you are an individual and you carve your</v>
<v Speaker 4>own way in this world and what's </v>

1287
01:00:23.911 --> 01:00:27.460
<v Speaker 4>important is your power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your ability to affect change on others.</v>

1288
01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:31.270
<v Speaker 4>Your ability to sleep with women,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the adulation of others.</v>

1289
01:00:31.450 --> 01:00:34.360
<v Speaker 4>And as I've got older and having </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience a degree of it,</v>

1290
01:00:34.361 --> 01:00:35.410
<v Speaker 4>I recognize,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1291
01:00:35.411 --> 01:00:36.880
<v Speaker 4>it's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't work.</v>

1292
01:00:36.910 --> 01:00:41.910
<v Speaker 4>And symbol things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Connection and community have become </v>

1293
01:00:41.910 --> 01:00:43.450
<v Speaker 4>more and more valuable to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's an ongoing thing because if you</v>

1294
01:00:43.810 --> 01:00:45.700
<v Speaker 4>set,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the percentage is so close,</v>

1295
01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:46.920
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not getting involved.</v>

1296
01:00:46.930 --> 01:00:51.930
<v Speaker 4>Recently in a campaign that it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got involved in a campaign to save a </v>

1297
01:00:51.930 --> 01:00:55.141
<v Speaker 4>house in the state a couple of years </v>
<v Speaker 4>back about these women asked me to tell </v>

1298
01:00:55.141 --> 01:00:57.991
<v Speaker 4>them our state's going to get turned </v>
<v Speaker 4>into commercial flats were all getting </v>

1299
01:00:57.991 --> 01:00:57.991
<v Speaker 4>evicted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We live here with our families.</v>

1300
01:00:57.991 --> 01:00:59.980
<v Speaker 4>I back their campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've got them on the tv,</v>

1301
01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:05.160
<v Speaker 4>this corporate power back down and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>was amazing because like ordinary </v>

1302
01:01:05.291 --> 01:01:06.830
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ordinary family be,</v>

1303
01:01:06.831 --> 01:01:09.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like the rebels be in the empire.</v>

1304
01:01:09.551 --> 01:01:12.490
<v Speaker 4>It's like an amazing achievement of </v>
<v Speaker 4>those people.</v>

1305
01:01:12.491 --> 01:01:15.750
<v Speaker 4>But my ego,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like there I am,</v>

1306
01:01:15.790 --> 01:01:18.940
<v Speaker 4>the power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am the power fed back into it.</v>

1307
01:01:18.941 --> 01:01:20.580
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so like I,</v>

1308
01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:25.630
<v Speaker 4>I see it as an ongoing thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that my life now is how can I convey</v>

1309
01:01:25.870 --> 01:01:29.140
<v Speaker 4>ideas that I think will help people in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>way that is accessible?</v>

1310
01:01:29.141 --> 01:01:31.690
<v Speaker 4>How can I be useful?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And knowing that my,</v>

1311
01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:36.870
<v Speaker 4>my role in this is to make sure that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't slip into the yoga egomania again </v>

1312
01:01:37.151 --> 01:01:39.490
<v Speaker 4>because I would love to be a cult leader</v>
<v Speaker 4>on some days.</v>

1313
01:01:39.590 --> 01:01:42.590
<v Speaker 3>Thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about it though and being aware</v>

1314
01:01:42.591 --> 01:01:45.500
<v Speaker 3>of it is one of the most important steps</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we're all,</v>

1315
01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:47.030
<v Speaker 3>we're all a work in progress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1316
01:01:47.031 --> 01:01:49.040
<v Speaker 3>there's no perfect person out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't exist.</v>

1317
01:01:49.041 --> 01:01:50.990
<v Speaker 3>And we've already discussed this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>ad nauseum,</v>

1318
01:01:51.410 --> 01:01:51.890
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1319
01:01:51.891 --> 01:01:53.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm a work in progress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a work in progress.</v>

1320
01:01:53.961 --> 01:01:55.580
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never met anybody who wasn't.</v>

1321
01:01:55.730 --> 01:01:58.400
<v Speaker 3>And I never met anybody who doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>vacillate at least a little bit,</v>

1322
01:01:58.401 --> 01:02:03.401
<v Speaker 3>larry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There were some days you're better than </v>

1323
01:02:03.401 --> 01:02:03.401
<v Speaker 3>other days and those days where you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>not as good,</v>

1324
01:02:03.401 --> 01:02:07.421
<v Speaker 3>you feel uncomfortable about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And those are the lid would lead to </v>

1325
01:02:07.421 --> 01:02:07.421
<v Speaker 3>better days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you find yourself slipping,</v>

1326
01:02:07.421 --> 01:02:11.480
<v Speaker 3>those slipping moments are actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>critical because they give you some self</v>

1327
01:02:11.481 --> 01:02:13.070
<v Speaker 3>awareness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You realize why I fucked up,</v>

1328
01:02:13.071 --> 01:02:14.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I yelled,</v>

1329
01:02:14.361 --> 01:02:17.090
<v Speaker 3>fuck you at my car window when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't have or whatever it was,</v>

1330
01:02:17.091 --> 01:02:17.390
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1331
01:02:17.470 --> 01:02:18.190
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

1332
01:02:18.220 --> 01:02:20.070
<v Speaker 4>this system is what provides</v>

1333
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:21.580
<v Speaker 2>you a way out at like the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1334
01:02:21.581 --> 01:02:24.940
<v Speaker 2>the recovery system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this 12 step system is that you like,</v>

1335
01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:27.690
<v Speaker 2>you would not rely on one person to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect.</v>

1336
01:02:27.691 --> 01:02:32.040
<v Speaker 2>You recognize everyone is fallible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but together as a community we can start</v>

1337
01:02:32.041 --> 01:02:35.310
<v Speaker 2>to have better objectives and in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>instance like I fuck up all the time,</v>

1338
01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:40.520
<v Speaker 2>but this step nine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>step 10 or about making amends when you </v>

1339
01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:43.230
<v Speaker 2>make a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I would like now I literally do this.</v>

1340
01:02:43.231 --> 01:02:44.710
<v Speaker 2>If there's a moment where I shout fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1341
01:02:44.730 --> 01:02:49.730
<v Speaker 2>but somebody or it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go shuffling back a day later </v>

1342
01:02:49.730 --> 01:02:50.880
<v Speaker 2>listening to this thing where I said </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>

1343
01:02:50.881 --> 01:02:53.880
<v Speaker 2>That was wrong with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That must have affected your feelings to</v>

1344
01:02:53.910 --> 01:02:56.770
<v Speaker 2>find someone in traffic there you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you.</v>

1345
01:02:57.220 --> 01:02:58.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll try and do it real quick.</v>

1346
01:02:59.170 --> 01:03:04.170
<v Speaker 2>You've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got fast and a lot of my fuck </v>

1347
01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:04.170
<v Speaker 2>you's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's on a phone call or maybe it's</v>

1348
01:03:04.170 --> 01:03:05.300
<v Speaker 2>in a shop or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The air like,</v>

1349
01:03:05.540 --> 01:03:09.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean in a way is about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suppose becoming a benevolent force in</v>

1350
01:03:09.511 --> 01:03:11.850
<v Speaker 2>this world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I tend towards that better,</v>

1351
01:03:11.851 --> 01:03:14.520
<v Speaker 2>50 point one percent as opposed to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>49,</v>

1352
01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:19.590
<v Speaker 2>then I'm becoming an a progressive agent</v>
<v Speaker 2>or a bird benevolent agent as opposed to</v>

1353
01:03:19.591 --> 01:03:21.480
<v Speaker 2>another person intoxicated.</v>

1354
01:03:22.090 --> 01:03:27.090
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a microcosm of what we were</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about earlier about society </v>

1355
01:03:27.090 --> 01:03:30.001
<v Speaker 3>itself is that one day in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look what the way we behave today is </v>

1356
01:03:30.001 --> 01:03:33.610
<v Speaker 3>light years past the way they behaved in</v>
<v Speaker 3>during the inquisition.</v>

1357
01:03:33.870 --> 01:03:34.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1358
01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:39.920
<v Speaker 3>in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I imagine especially today because </v>

1359
01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:42.490
<v Speaker 3>people have so much access to the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>other people have behaved.</v>

1360
01:03:42.850 --> 01:03:47.440
<v Speaker 3>We have so much data on just written </v>
<v Speaker 3>words,</v>

1361
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:52.480
<v Speaker 3>listening to people talk and podcasts </v>
<v Speaker 3>and speeches and watching videos.</v>

1362
01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:55.590
<v Speaker 3>There's so much more data than there </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever was available.</v>

1363
01:03:55.591 --> 01:03:57.700
<v Speaker 3>One hundred,</v>
<v Speaker 3>200 a thousand years ago,</v>

1364
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:03.000
<v Speaker 3>that in the future we're going to have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>much better way of communicating based </v>

1365
01:04:03.851 --> 01:04:05.770
<v Speaker 3>on the learning and growth if we </v>
<v Speaker 3>survive.</v>

1366
01:04:05.771 --> 01:04:10.771
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think that's the same thing with </v>

1367
01:04:10.771 --> 01:04:10.771
<v Speaker 3>You and I and everybody listening to </v>
<v Speaker 3>this as a human being.</v>

1368
01:04:10.771 --> 01:04:15.420
<v Speaker 3>If you continue to grow and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>fall into all these traps as time goes </v>

1369
01:04:15.420 --> 01:04:16.750
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will be a better version.</v>

1370
01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:21.960
<v Speaker 3>It's slow and it's fucking brutal and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's painful sometimes because it's </v>

1371
01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:22.810
<v Speaker 3>just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>You feel like,</v>

1372
01:04:22.811 --> 01:04:25.150
<v Speaker 3>god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't I have my shit together?</v>

1373
01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:26.220
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>

1374
01:04:27.060 --> 01:04:32.060
<v Speaker 3>I was saying this about Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like someone was writing off Donald </v>

1375
01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:32.060
<v Speaker 3>Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he's never going to learn.</v>

1376
01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:32.060
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's who he is.</v>

1377
01:04:32.060 --> 01:04:36.481
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did you just stop learning when you're </v>

1378
01:04:36.481 --> 01:04:36.481
<v Speaker 3>70,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1379
01:04:36.481 --> 01:04:36.481
<v Speaker 3>70?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1380
01:04:36.481 --> 01:04:37.510
<v Speaker 3>It's over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no more data's getting in there.</v>

1381
01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:38.350
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1382
01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:38.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1383
01:04:39.070 --> 01:04:41.920
<v Speaker 3>maybe Donald Trump could have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>revelation one day,</v>

1384
01:04:41.950 --> 01:04:46.950
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe Donald Trump could realize the </v>

1385
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:47.270
<v Speaker 3>error of his ways and the way he </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicates is his,</v>

1386
01:04:47.330 --> 01:04:52.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's causing more problems and he's </v>

1387
01:04:52.330 --> 01:04:52.330
<v Speaker 3>fixing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1388
01:04:52.330 --> 01:04:54.380
<v Speaker 3>maybe he'll be not even to point him out</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's just,</v>

1389
01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:56.230
<v Speaker 3>he's just one of us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1390
01:04:56.430 --> 01:05:00.220
<v Speaker 3>To all of us that I think we're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're all slowly,</v>

1391
01:05:00.221 --> 01:05:05.221
<v Speaker 3>brutally piecing this thing together and</v>
<v Speaker 3>hopefully we're better at it than we </v>

1392
01:05:05.221 --> 01:05:08.170
<v Speaker 3>were a week ago and hopefully we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>better at it than we were six months ago</v>

1393
01:05:08.350 --> 01:05:09.550
<v Speaker 3>and that it's going to continue.</v>

1394
01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:14.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that feels like the general tendency in </v>

1395
01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:14.960
<v Speaker 2>my own life to put out the general </v>
<v Speaker 2>tendency in your life.</v>

1396
01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:15.320
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

1397
01:05:15.470 --> 01:05:20.470
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the things that's helped </v>

1398
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:20.470
<v Speaker 3>tremendously as this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being able to have these long three hour</v>

1399
01:05:20.470 --> 01:05:24.811
<v Speaker 3>conversations with people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you sit down and talk to them with no </v>

1400
01:05:24.811 --> 01:05:25.310
<v Speaker 3>distractions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't exist anywhere else.</v>

1401
01:05:25.311 --> 01:05:26.680
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't exist in nature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Someone.</v>

1402
01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:28.540
<v Speaker 3>Someone said this to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they said,</v>

1403
01:05:28.541 --> 01:05:33.541
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you always say on your Podcast that you </v>

1404
01:05:33.541 --> 01:05:33.541
<v Speaker 3>just try to have a conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

1405
01:05:33.541 --> 01:05:33.541
<v Speaker 3>but who the fuck has these kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations?</v>

1406
01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:36.940
<v Speaker 3>We just sit down and stare at each other</v>
<v Speaker 3>and talk for hours at a time.</v>

1407
01:05:36.941 --> 01:05:38.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get your right.</v>

1408
01:05:38.771 --> 01:05:40.720
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is just a conversation still,</v>

1409
01:05:40.721 --> 01:05:41.650
<v Speaker 3>but you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that,</v>

1410
01:05:41.651 --> 01:05:44.310
<v Speaker 3>it's sort of an accelerated form of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a.</v>

1411
01:05:44.350 --> 01:05:45.370
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1412
01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:47.830
<v Speaker 3>you could kind of apply it to everything</v>
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>

1413
01:05:47.831 --> 01:05:50.550
<v Speaker 3>If you spent enough time doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1414
01:05:50.551 --> 01:05:51.330
<v Speaker 3>you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1415
01:05:51.350 --> 01:05:53.290
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get better at it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to.</v>

1416
01:05:53.590 --> 01:05:58.590
<v Speaker 3>A lot of the podcasts is thinking right </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's an examining your own behavior </v>

1417
01:05:58.590 --> 01:06:02.161
<v Speaker 3>and examining the way you interface with</v>
<v Speaker 3>other people and I do more of that than </v>

1418
01:06:02.161 --> 01:06:06.571
<v Speaker 3>I ever have before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you want to change about </v>

1419
01:06:06.571 --> 01:06:06.820
<v Speaker 3>yourself?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just keep going the same way.</v>

1420
01:06:06.821 --> 01:06:10.540
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get better at being nice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get better at being honest,</v>

1421
01:06:10.541 --> 01:06:12.360
<v Speaker 3>get better at being in loving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1422
01:06:12.361 --> 01:06:14.300
<v Speaker 3>it sounds hokey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hippie bullshit.</v>

1423
01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:15.750
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1424
01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:16.960
<v Speaker 3>I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to be nicer.</v>

1425
01:06:16.961 --> 01:06:18.790
<v Speaker 3>To me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to have better relationships with</v>

1426
01:06:18.791 --> 01:06:21.190
<v Speaker 3>my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>better relationships with my family,</v>

1427
01:06:21.191 --> 01:06:23.920
<v Speaker 3>better relationships with people that I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't even know that.</v>

1428
01:06:23.921 --> 01:06:27.910
<v Speaker 3>I mean I just want to interface with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world in a more positive way.</v>

1429
01:06:28.140 --> 01:06:33.140
<v Speaker 3>I think one of the most important things</v>
<v Speaker 3>to realize is all the interactions that </v>

1430
01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:34.510
<v Speaker 3>we have with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a dependent upon to individuals or more.</v>

1431
01:06:34.510 --> 01:06:39.510
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's You and whoever you encounter </v>

1432
01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:42.530
<v Speaker 3>and the way you encountered them is </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to change the way they behave to </v>

1433
01:06:42.530 --> 01:06:47.371
<v Speaker 3>you and everybody always wants to put it</v>
<v Speaker 3>off on the person who behaved a certain </v>

1434
01:06:47.371 --> 01:06:49.240
<v Speaker 3>way to them and in some ways you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1435
01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:54.480
<v Speaker 3>but in other ways your reaction is </v>
<v Speaker 3>completely dependent on your own way of </v>

1436
01:06:55.691 --> 01:07:00.691
<v Speaker 3>approaching it and your reaction may </v>
<v Speaker 3>change the way they react and you'll </v>

1437
01:07:00.691 --> 01:07:02.800
<v Speaker 3>complete the right like any.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if the,</v>

1438
01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:05.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>throwIng a pool against that brick wall,</v>

1439
01:07:05.021 --> 01:07:10.021
<v Speaker 3>it will bounce back a certain way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if that became a softer surface or </v>

1440
01:07:10.021 --> 01:07:10.021
<v Speaker 3>indeed a furry wall to quote one of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>own films,</v>

1441
01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:15.150
<v Speaker 3>that it will bounce back in a different </v>
<v Speaker 3>way so that they did another thing </v>

1442
01:07:15.150 --> 01:07:17.050
<v Speaker 3>that's in the program than necessity for</v>
<v Speaker 3>forgiveness.</v>

1443
01:07:17.770 --> 01:07:22.770
<v Speaker 3>If you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you instead of blaming your past and </v>

1444
01:07:22.770 --> 01:07:23.080
<v Speaker 3>blaming other people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you come to a point of forgiveness.</v>

1445
01:07:23.290 --> 01:07:27.280
<v Speaker 3>This creates the silver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the nexus for change.</v>

1446
01:07:27.281 --> 01:07:28.040
<v Speaker 3>As long as you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

1447
01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:33.100
<v Speaker 3>that person felt me out when I was a kid</v>
<v Speaker 3>or my bad wasn't a loving figure in my </v>

1448
01:07:33.521 --> 01:07:34.990
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As long as I hold onto that belief,</v>

1449
01:07:34.991 --> 01:07:36.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm trapped by it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1450
01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:39.670
<v Speaker 3>I say I relinquished that now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not happening anymore.</v>

1451
01:07:39.910 --> 01:07:42.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm willing to move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's another human being.</v>

1452
01:07:42.071 --> 01:07:45.670
<v Speaker 3>They were doing the best they could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Suddenly you're liberate it in your path</v>

1453
01:07:45.671 --> 01:07:46.780
<v Speaker 3>changes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

1454
01:07:46.781 --> 01:07:48.400
<v Speaker 3>joe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you were saying just then mate,</v>

1455
01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:53.700
<v Speaker 3>about like wanting to help people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you have any particular projects are </v>

1456
01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:56.791
<v Speaker 3>specifically about that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously this podcast is a tool for </v>

1457
01:07:56.791 --> 01:08:00.991
<v Speaker 3>education,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but do you have anything that </v>

1458
01:08:00.991 --> 01:08:00.991
<v Speaker 3>specifically about right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do this thing like,</v>

1459
01:08:00.991 --> 01:08:05.521
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take in martial arts in the community </v>

1460
01:08:05.521 --> 01:08:05.521
<v Speaker 3>type stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1461
01:08:05.521 --> 01:08:07.000
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think it'd be really good at that if</v>

1462
01:08:07.001 --> 01:08:08.620
<v Speaker 3>I had more time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just don't.</v>

1463
01:08:08.621 --> 01:08:10.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't have enough time to do what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>already doing,</v>

1464
01:08:10.810 --> 01:08:15.810
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In terms of just sheer numbers of hours </v>

1465
01:08:15.810 --> 01:08:15.950
<v Speaker 3>in the day and I think</v>

1466
01:08:16.310 --> 01:08:19.250
<v Speaker 2>I can't just work because if I just </v>
<v Speaker 2>worked,</v>

1467
01:08:19.251 --> 01:08:21.830
<v Speaker 2>my work won't be any good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have to live.</v>

1468
01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:26.860
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the most important things </v>
<v Speaker 2>about standup comedy is you can't just </v>

1469
01:08:26.860 --> 01:08:30.161
<v Speaker 2>do comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to do other things and this is </v>

1470
01:08:30.161 --> 01:08:30.161
<v Speaker 2>something that took me a long time to </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out like you can't,</v>

1471
01:08:30.161 --> 01:08:35.040
<v Speaker 2>like you ever see a lot of comics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just started talking about airline </v>

1472
01:08:35.040 --> 01:08:38.291
<v Speaker 2>travel and hotel rooms and your life is </v>
<v Speaker 2>your life and they can relate to it,</v>

1473
01:08:39.591 --> 01:08:40.610
<v Speaker 2>so that's what they talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

1474
01:08:40.611 --> 01:08:44.510
<v Speaker 2>That to me is a failure of gathering </v>
<v Speaker 2>research.</v>

1475
01:08:45.190 --> 01:08:46.650
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's life,</v>

1476
01:08:46.670 --> 01:08:48.620
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But your life has to.</v>

1477
01:08:48.621 --> 01:08:53.621
<v Speaker 2>I think in order to have a continual </v>
<v Speaker 2>body of work again,</v>

1478
01:08:53.850 --> 01:08:56.570
<v Speaker 2>he can't just constantly talk about </v>
<v Speaker 2>airline travel.</v>

1479
01:08:56.840 --> 01:09:01.840
<v Speaker 2>You have input.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My thing in the beginning of this was </v>

1480
01:09:01.840 --> 01:09:05.741
<v Speaker 2>about airline travel and the low level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>low frequency anxiety I experienced in </v>

1481
01:09:05.741 --> 01:09:06.380
<v Speaker 2>airline workers.</v>

1482
01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:11.410
<v Speaker 2>It certainly wasn't a comedic bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was cultural analysis and did to </v>

1483
01:09:11.410 --> 01:09:14.260
<v Speaker 2>a degree revealed that I'm in the middle</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a press junket and that's my life at </v>

1484
01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:17.501
<v Speaker 2>the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could just as easily have told you </v>

1485
01:09:17.501 --> 01:09:17.501
<v Speaker 2>about bees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a bee keeper.</v>

1486
01:09:17.501 --> 01:09:17.501
<v Speaker 2>I've bees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1487
01:09:17.501 --> 01:09:19.430
<v Speaker 2>Do you swim in the river?</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have experiences,</v>

1488
01:09:19.640 --> 01:09:22.130
<v Speaker 2>you have said for we sort of one be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not keeping one b,</v>

1489
01:09:22.420 --> 01:09:25.810
<v Speaker 2>one b,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one one doesn't work.</v>

1490
01:09:25.811 --> 01:09:27.010

<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

1491

<v Speaker 2>I said responsibility to have now.</v>

1492

<v Speaker 2>Sixty thousand pounds.</v>

01:09:34.810 --> 01:09:34.810
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he doesn't.</v>

1494
01:09:34.810 --> 01:09:34.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>

1495
01:09:34.810 --> 01:09:34.810
<v Speaker 2>It's given me and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's your standard,</v>

01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:47.090
<v Speaker 2>towards the new netflix special that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do in either march or april.</v>

1500
01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:48.950
<v Speaker 2>I have to figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1501
01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:53.980
<v Speaker 2>want to do it in boston and I don't want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do when it's too cold because that </v>

1502
01:09:53.980 --> 01:09:55.030
<v Speaker 2>1000 seat place in boston.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think wilbur.</v>

1503
01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:55.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they will.</v>

1504
01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:58.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's awesome little theater because it's</v>

1505
01:09:58.911 --> 01:10:03.911
<v Speaker 2>really 900 seats and it's really three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>300 seat comedy clubs.</v>

1506
01:10:03.940 --> 01:10:06.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's three stacked on top of each other.</v>

1507
01:10:06.351 --> 01:10:08.310
<v Speaker 2>It's a great venue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1508
01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:13.560
<v Speaker 2>you'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're going to do an hour of free </v>

1509
01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:13.560
<v Speaker 2>nights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>

1510
01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:16.510
<v Speaker 2>you'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if you got to a free 20 minute </v>

1511
01:10:16.510 --> 01:10:16.510
<v Speaker 2>average?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what your pit.</v>

1512
01:10:16.510 --> 01:10:16.630
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyways,</v>

1513
01:10:16.640 --> 01:10:21.640
<v Speaker 2>if you don't mind me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's difficult to talk about it on the </v>

1514
01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:22.070
<v Speaker 2>podcast because without going into </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual.</v>

1515
01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:27.960
<v Speaker 2>But can you tell about the area or I'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you about my arrows to show you </v>

1516
01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:30.330
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think I talked about like when I </v>

1517
01:10:30.330 --> 01:10:30.980
<v Speaker 2>got heavily involved in politics and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>found myself on tv shows and doing rants</v>

1518
01:10:31.040 --> 01:10:32.840
<v Speaker 2>on telly and getting into arguments.</v>

1519
01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:34.220
<v Speaker 2>Those are great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but otherwise thank you.</v>

1520
01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:35.690
<v Speaker 2>I love doing those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Love the one you did.</v>

1521
01:10:35.691 --> 01:10:37.500
<v Speaker 2>Was it fox news that you did one with </v>
<v Speaker 2>it?</v>

1522
01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:39.800
<v Speaker 2>Breaking down like what are we doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>here?</v>

1523
01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:41.980
<v Speaker 2>I love doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked that love,</v>

1524
01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:44.570
<v Speaker 2>ridicule available.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you get into the analysis,</v>

1525
01:10:44.680 --> 01:10:49.680
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a fucking runaway train and once </v>

1526
01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:51.941
<v Speaker 2>you start a sentence and you start going</v>
<v Speaker 2>very fast and powerful and they'll be </v>

1527
01:10:51.941 --> 01:10:51.941
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

1528
01:10:51.941 --> 01:10:51.941
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>

1529
01:10:51.941 --> 01:10:51.941
<v Speaker 2>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

1530
01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:56.600
<v Speaker 2>And there's not a lot of ums or uhs to </v>
<v Speaker 2>interject and they're sitting there.</v>

1531
01:10:56.601 --> 01:10:57.690
<v Speaker 2>They're all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1532
01:10:57.691 --> 01:11:02.691
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the little starry eyed in the first </v>

1533
01:11:02.691 --> 01:11:02.691
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Second of all though,</v>

1534
01:11:02.691 --> 01:11:03.520
<v Speaker 2>the runaway trains happened like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1535
01:11:03.750 --> 01:11:08.750
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>under the ride's over five minutes </v>

1536
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:10.751
<v Speaker 2>later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like tin cans or rolling down the aisle </v>

1537
01:11:10.751 --> 01:11:10.751
<v Speaker 2>and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1538
01:11:10.751 --> 01:11:12.290
<v Speaker 2>it's a good technique because see that </v>
<v Speaker 2>what we were saying about bjj,</v>

1539
01:11:12.291 --> 01:11:15.090
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that language don't know the language,</v>

1540
01:11:15.091 --> 01:11:17.040
<v Speaker 2>the language comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a language I've worked on.</v>

1541
01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:19.830
<v Speaker 2>So one of my techniques is never create </v>
<v Speaker 2>space.</v>

1542
01:11:19.831 --> 01:11:24.300
<v Speaker 2>Give them no space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no space,</v>

1543
01:11:24.301 --> 01:11:29.301
<v Speaker 2>no space smush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if you take the actual jujitsu out </v>

1544
01:11:29.301 --> 01:11:29.301
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm brilliant.</v>

1545
01:11:29.301 --> 01:11:32.040
<v Speaker 2>Or jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just the actual physical contact.</v>

1546
01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:35.990
<v Speaker 2>Hold locks and chokes judges who shows </v>
<v Speaker 2>itself in all forms.</v>

1547
01:11:36.270 --> 01:11:37.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is true.</v>

1548
01:11:37.621 --> 01:11:39.720
<v Speaker 2>Transcendence to find one universal </v>
<v Speaker 2>language,</v>

1549
01:11:39.721 --> 01:11:42.420
<v Speaker 2>one universal myth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one mind one consciousness,</v>

1550
01:11:42.450 --> 01:11:43.340
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

1551
01:11:43.590 --> 01:11:44.550
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way broadly.</v>

1552
01:11:44.551 --> 01:11:46.330
<v Speaker 2>And you'll see it in all things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Ryan Hamilton,</v>

1553
01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:48.750
<v Speaker 2>masashi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was pretty good for five rings.</v>

1554
01:11:48.810 --> 01:11:53.810
<v Speaker 2>Just drop that in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chinese philosophy or something like </v>

1555
01:11:53.810 --> 01:11:54.960
<v Speaker 2>that to my arm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is he?</v>

1556
01:11:54.961 --> 01:11:59.030
<v Speaker 2>Some sort of master?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a samurai that was a,</v>

1557
01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:00.230
<v Speaker 2>he was a ronan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was,</v>

1558
01:12:00.231 --> 01:12:05.231
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during the time where samurais roamed </v>

1559
01:12:05.231 --> 01:12:05.520
<v Speaker 2>the earth and got into these one-on-one </v>
<v Speaker 2>sword fights.</v>

1560
01:12:05.521 --> 01:12:08.400
<v Speaker 2>And he killed 62 men in one-on-one sword</v>
<v Speaker 2>fights.</v>

1561
01:12:08.970 --> 01:12:10.530
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>life in a bad motherfucker.</v>

1562
01:12:10.530 --> 01:12:13.080
<v Speaker 2>He wrote an amazing book on strategy in </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

1563
01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:17.250
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things that he emphasized</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that book is that a real warrior must</v>

1564
01:12:17.251 --> 01:12:22.251
<v Speaker 2>be balanced.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You must be good at art and calligraphy </v>

1565
01:12:22.251 --> 01:12:22.251
<v Speaker 2>and poetry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

1566
01:12:22.251 --> 01:12:25.610
<v Speaker 2>Can't have any holes in your game that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a balanced person in order to </v>

1567
01:12:25.610 --> 01:12:26.970
<v Speaker 2>survive in these intense moments of </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorts,</v>

1568
01:12:26.971 --> 01:12:31.971
<v Speaker 2>flying at your face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had never teach a man to fight who </v>

1569
01:12:31.971 --> 01:12:31.971
<v Speaker 2>doesn't know how to dance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's quite good in it.</v>

1570
01:12:32.350 --> 01:12:37.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how to dance set paycheck </v>
<v Speaker 2>they like.</v>

1571
01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:41.010
<v Speaker 2>But what I sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I've done is I've found things like</v>

1572
01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:46.190
<v Speaker 2>the approach from a different angle of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like pointing out the things that I did </v>

1573
01:12:46.190 --> 01:12:47.730
<v Speaker 2>wrong in my political campaigning where </v>
<v Speaker 2>I floored and fed into my ego.</v>

1574
01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:51.240
<v Speaker 2>I do a good long bit about the birth of </v>
<v Speaker 2>my daughter,</v>

1575
01:12:51.570 --> 01:12:54.630
<v Speaker 2>like purely from the perspective of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>watching a birth,</v>

1576
01:12:54.631 --> 01:12:55.350
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1577
01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:55.990
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1578
01:12:56.040 --> 01:12:56.780
<v Speaker 2>commentary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1579
01:12:56.790 --> 01:12:59.160
<v Speaker 2>sports commentary on the baby coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>

1580
01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:00.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't use the beat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1581
01:13:00.370 --> 01:13:05.370
<v Speaker 2>the rhythms of sports commentary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just actually describing what </v>

1582
01:13:05.370 --> 01:13:08.781
<v Speaker 2>happened and what it did to my mind to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be present at the birth of my daughter </v>

1583
01:13:08.781 --> 01:13:09.630
<v Speaker 2>to experience something that's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>defined,</v>

1584
01:13:09.631 --> 01:13:12.780
<v Speaker 2>but so animal tearing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>flesh roaring and all that stuff.</v>

1585
01:13:12.781 --> 01:13:15.030
<v Speaker 2>But It's like god is in their house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1586
01:13:15.330 --> 01:13:20.330
<v Speaker 2>So it did it beyond that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in every time I building up into a </v>

1587
01:13:20.330 --> 01:13:20.880
<v Speaker 2>point of divinity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I undercut it with like,</v>

1588
01:13:20.881 --> 01:13:23.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how sort of mad it looks and the obvious</v>

1589
01:13:23.290 --> 01:13:26.210
<v Speaker 2>stuff I guess you'd call it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like I do that so.</v>

1590
01:13:26.290 --> 01:13:29.790
<v Speaker 2>And the whole show rebif,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I'm doing from a netflix,</v>

1591
01:13:29.791 --> 01:13:32.640
<v Speaker 2>I believe at some point soon it's like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>is about,</v>

1592
01:13:32.641 --> 01:13:37.641
<v Speaker 2>it's called rebirth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the point of it is how having the </v>

1593
01:13:37.641 --> 01:13:37.641
<v Speaker 2>babies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>men,</v>

1594
01:13:37.641 --> 01:13:41.780
<v Speaker 2>I've been reborn to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of it's about recognizing the </v>

1595
01:13:41.780 --> 01:13:45.621
<v Speaker 2>limits because I think I got very </v>
<v Speaker 2>narcissistically involved in politics </v>

1596
01:13:45.621 --> 01:13:49.340
<v Speaker 2>the same way and possibly getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>narcissistically involved in </v>

1597
01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:49.450
<v Speaker 2>spirituality right now because I still </v>
<v Speaker 2>have this yearning,</v>

1598
01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:52.410
<v Speaker 2>this thing that wants to change other </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's lives,</v>

1599
01:13:52.411 --> 01:13:55.170
<v Speaker 2>changed the world in inverted commas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1600
01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:59.360
<v Speaker 2>but like the comedy comes from </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognizing my own flaws within you.</v>

1601
01:13:59.361 --> 01:14:04.361
<v Speaker 2>Do you do any sort of like really </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult to exercise outside of a </v>

1602
01:14:04.361 --> 01:14:06.090
<v Speaker 2>jujitsu?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever do ever get involved in,</v>

1603
01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:07.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any like yoga,</v>

1604
01:14:07.891 --> 01:14:10.020
<v Speaker 2>like intense yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like long periods of time,</v>

1605
01:14:10.021 --> 01:14:12.070
<v Speaker 2>like 90 minute hot yoga classes</v>

1606
01:14:12.070 --> 01:14:15.820
<v Speaker 3>or running or anything where you really </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to push yourself physically,</v>

1607
01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:21.060
<v Speaker 3>really push a run and then listen to </v>
<v Speaker 3>your podcasts and sam harris' podcast </v>

1608
01:14:21.060 --> 01:14:23.080
<v Speaker 3>sometimes or wherever and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I do.</v>

1609
01:14:23.260 --> 01:14:25.140
<v Speaker 3>I do do yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not like.</v>

1610
01:14:25.200 --> 01:14:28.150
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting that you specifically </v>
<v Speaker 3>say push yourself to the limit.</v>

1611
01:14:28.151 --> 01:14:29.150
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think that's an important </v>
<v Speaker 3>part?</v>

1612
01:14:29.151 --> 01:14:34.151
<v Speaker 3>I think there's a freeing aspect and </v>
<v Speaker 3>pushing boundaries and physical </v>

1613
01:14:34.151 --> 01:14:36.430
<v Speaker 3>boundaries because it's exhausting and </v>
<v Speaker 3>not just exhausting physically,</v>

1614
01:14:36.431 --> 01:14:39.560
<v Speaker 3>but mentally too because there's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>strain on your.</v>

1615
01:14:39.561 --> 01:14:41.950
<v Speaker 3>Your body's desire to quit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like your,</v>

1616
01:14:41.960 --> 01:14:46.960
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your mind's desire to seek comfort and </v>

1617
01:14:46.960 --> 01:14:50.191
<v Speaker 3>that in pushing past that you find this </v>
<v Speaker 3>freedom and you also find a </v>

1618
01:14:50.191 --> 01:14:50.890
<v Speaker 3>vulnerability and who you are as a </v>
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>

1619
01:14:51.230 --> 01:14:56.230
<v Speaker 3>It's very difficult to think greatly of </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself and to Be egos autistic when </v>

1620
01:14:56.230 --> 01:14:58.750
<v Speaker 3>you know that you're so fucking tired,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to put your hands on your knees</v>

1621
01:14:58.751 --> 01:15:00.400
<v Speaker 3>and your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're heaving and you know,</v>

1622
01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:02.510
<v Speaker 3>and then you have to keep going and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

1623
01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:03.240
<v Speaker 3>don't be opposed to you.</v>

1624
01:15:03.250 --> 01:15:04.030
<v Speaker 3>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep going.</v>

1625
01:15:04.150 --> 01:15:05.110
<v Speaker 3>And so you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't,</v>

1626
01:15:05.290 --> 01:15:09.490
<v Speaker 3>you realize who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You feel yourself for who you really are</v>

1627
01:15:09.491 --> 01:15:13.680
<v Speaker 3>as opposed to like adulation and looking</v>
<v Speaker 3>at yourself as this,</v>

1628
01:15:13.681 --> 01:15:15.820
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this thing that's above it all.</v>

1629
01:15:15.970 --> 01:15:19.150
<v Speaker 3>Like you realize the flaws in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>mental process,</v>

1630
01:15:19.151 --> 01:15:21.640
<v Speaker 3>the flaws in your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your physical abilities.</v>

1631
01:15:21.880 --> 01:15:24.250
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's very humbling you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1632
01:15:24.251 --> 01:15:29.251
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can see that doing that in a bodily </v>

1633
01:15:29.251 --> 01:15:29.251
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it will be useful.</v>

1634
01:15:29.251 --> 01:15:30.070
<v Speaker 3>But like I tell you the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the trouble for me,</v>

1635
01:15:30.071 --> 01:15:35.071
<v Speaker 3>and I think a lot of addicts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not the like of course they self </v>

1636
01:15:35.071 --> 01:15:38.101
<v Speaker 3>obsession,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but self obsession isn't usually about </v>

1637
01:15:38.101 --> 01:15:38.770
<v Speaker 3>fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>IT's normally I'm worthless.</v>

1638
01:15:38.830 --> 01:15:40.870
<v Speaker 3>That's why he comes mostly from that </v>
<v Speaker 3>position,</v>

1639
01:15:40.871 --> 01:15:43.270
<v Speaker 3>but it's also you're thInking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>yourself all the time,</v>

1640
01:15:43.271 --> 01:15:48.271
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is the problem that needs to be </v>

1641
01:15:48.271 --> 01:15:48.271
<v Speaker 3>decoded.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think you're right,</v>

1642
01:15:48.271 --> 01:15:48.910
<v Speaker 3>that physical exercise is really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really important.</v>

1643
01:15:48.910 --> 01:15:51.400
<v Speaker 3>The level to the level to which I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>I always feel better.</v>

1644
01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:56.460
<v Speaker 3>It's not my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I have to work even to bloody do </v>

1645
01:15:56.460 --> 01:15:59.221
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd rather spend a ton of time thinking </v>

1646
01:15:59.221 --> 01:16:01.360
<v Speaker 3>or doing something thinking I'm fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming is thinking that's what's,</v>

1647
01:16:01.361 --> 01:16:03.820
<v Speaker 3>what's confusing about it to people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's thinking,</v>

1648
01:16:03.821 --> 01:16:05.500
<v Speaker 3>but it's thinking in a very different </v>
<v Speaker 3>Way.</v>

1649
01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:10.800
<v Speaker 3>Like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's thinking when your body's at </v>

1650
01:16:10.800 --> 01:16:12.961
<v Speaker 3>rest and you're just using your mind </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether there's also thinking when your </v>

1651
01:16:12.961 --> 01:16:14.080
<v Speaker 3>mind is trying to manage your body under</v>
<v Speaker 3>extreme stress.</v>

1652
01:16:14.081 --> 01:16:17.530
<v Speaker 3>And that is also a mental exercise and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where people get it wrong.</v>

1653
01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:22.740
<v Speaker 3>When people look at people that exercise</v>
<v Speaker 3>and especially people that work out </v>

1654
01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:25.510
<v Speaker 3>really hard and they think of them as </v>
<v Speaker 3>meatheads or as like someone who's based</v>

1655
01:16:25.570 --> 01:16:30.570
<v Speaker 3>or primal and unevolved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I feel like there's a high level of </v>

1656
01:16:30.570 --> 01:16:33.320
<v Speaker 3>mental evolution involved and being able</v>
<v Speaker 3>to push yourself like,</v>

1657
01:16:33.610 --> 01:16:36.700
<v Speaker 3>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really admire people that,</v>

1658
01:16:36.830 --> 01:16:39.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you'll see like a lot of old people</v>

1659
01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:40.450
<v Speaker 3>that are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1660
01:16:40.750 --> 01:16:45.750
<v Speaker 3>I see him in yoga class all the time </v>
<v Speaker 3>that just never fucking stop in there.</v>

1661
01:16:46.691 --> 01:16:48.730
<v Speaker 3>And they don't have extreme physical </v>
<v Speaker 3>abilities at all.</v>

1662
01:16:48.731 --> 01:16:51.610
<v Speaker 3>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's nothing athletic aBout them.</v>

1663
01:16:51.611 --> 01:16:53.770
<v Speaker 3>They're not strong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're in there grinding.</v>

1664
01:16:54.070 --> 01:16:56.170
<v Speaker 3>and in doing so you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1665
01:16:56.171 --> 01:16:58.600
<v Speaker 3>it can't possibly be comfortable for </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1666
01:16:58.601 --> 01:17:00.780
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look at their saggy arms and their old</v>

1667
01:17:00.790 --> 01:17:03.400
<v Speaker 3>legs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not like some graceful person is</v>

1668
01:17:03.401 --> 01:17:06.670
<v Speaker 3>able to do this easily.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a person who's really struggling</v>

1669
01:17:06.910 --> 01:17:10.310
<v Speaker 3>and in real struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like that is a mental</v>

1670
01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:15.370
<v Speaker 2>energy that's involved in forcing your </v>
<v Speaker 2>body to go through these uncomfortable </v>

1671
01:17:15.370 --> 01:17:17.000
<v Speaker 2>emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That I think is very freeing.</v>

1672
01:17:17.140 --> 01:17:18.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>

1673
01:17:18.561 --> 01:17:23.561
<v Speaker 2>What you said as well about balance and </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly what you're saying is that I'm </v>

1674
01:17:23.561 --> 01:17:24.380
<v Speaker 2>a person who will benefit from more of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1675
01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:27.660
<v Speaker 2>I see a guy in the gym once and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't stop exercising.</v>

1676
01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:29.300
<v Speaker 2>He was old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like in his seventies.</v>

1677
01:17:29.301 --> 01:17:30.410
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't stop exercising,</v>

1678
01:17:30.411 --> 01:17:32.620
<v Speaker 2>don't let your body find out these </v>
<v Speaker 2>dying.</v>

1679
01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:37.220
<v Speaker 2>I just keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't let your body find out.</v>

1680
01:17:37.221 --> 01:17:38.510
<v Speaker 2>It's dying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's great.</v>

1681
01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:39.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty cool.</v>

1682
01:17:39.501 --> 01:17:40.090
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1683
01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:40.970
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1684
01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:43.940
<v Speaker 2>but like I think that in any form of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1685
01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:47.000
<v Speaker 2>I think that some variety of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you do the yoga,</v>

1686
01:17:47.060 --> 01:17:48.800
<v Speaker 2>you do the brazilian jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do the running.</v>

1687
01:17:48.801 --> 01:17:51.020
<v Speaker 2>I think it's very important of different</v>
<v Speaker 2>forms of exercise,</v>

1688
01:17:51.021 --> 01:17:56.021
<v Speaker 2>different forms of mental activity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different forms of stimulation to live </v>

1689
01:17:56.021 --> 01:17:57.710
<v Speaker 2>like good because this is what this </v>
<v Speaker 2>machine is designed to do.</v>

1690
01:17:57.710 --> 01:18:02.710
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I returned to the problem of capitalism </v>

1691
01:18:02.710 --> 01:18:05.290
<v Speaker 2>is that it reduces you to your role </v>
<v Speaker 2>within an economic system as opposed to </v>

1692
01:18:05.330 --> 01:18:07.490
<v Speaker 2>why not gap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go for a run through a bit of fishing.</v>

1693
01:18:07.710 --> 01:18:09.350
<v Speaker 2>Could wander around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shoot some arrows,</v>

1694
01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:11.930
<v Speaker 2>do whatever it is you're into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I spend some time,</v>

1695
01:18:11.931 --> 01:18:14.150
<v Speaker 2>meditate in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>spend some time exercising,</v>

1696
01:18:14.151 --> 01:18:16.500
<v Speaker 2>spent a time in loving physical combat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1697
01:18:16.510 --> 01:18:18.500
<v Speaker 2>the reason you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no fucking time because he's.</v>

1698
01:18:18.501 --> 01:18:21.630
<v Speaker 2>Your job is to stand on the line or in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that cheese grater.</v>

1699
01:18:21.770 --> 01:18:24.500
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just get your soul ground down.</v>

1700
01:18:24.501 --> 01:18:26.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's necessary anymore.</v>

1701
01:18:26.810 --> 01:18:31.810
<v Speaker 2>It's not necessarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's certainly isn't necessarily enough </v>

1702
01:18:31.810 --> 01:18:33.380
<v Speaker 2>to justify spending eight hours plus a </v>
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>

1703
01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:36.080
<v Speaker 2>five days a week inside some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>box.</v>

1704
01:18:36.090 --> 01:18:41.090
<v Speaker 2>I know a while ago you said we are both </v>
<v Speaker 2>a speck of dust and limitless </v>

1705
01:18:41.090 --> 01:18:43.550
<v Speaker 2>consciousness and this I agree with to </v>
<v Speaker 2>limitless expansion,</v>

1706
01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:48.640
<v Speaker 2>limitless contraction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>possible within consciousness and what </v>

1707
01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:51.971
<v Speaker 2>you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that one idea can change the world </v>

1708
01:18:51.971 --> 01:18:54.200
<v Speaker 2>very quickly and that's why they'd be </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems regulate the kind of information</v>

1709
01:18:54.201 --> 01:18:59.201
<v Speaker 2>that's available and the way that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>transmitted and also the fact that it </v>

1710
01:18:59.201 --> 01:18:59.480
<v Speaker 2>exists within the same economic model.</v>

1711
01:18:59.670 --> 01:19:01.460
<v Speaker 2>You can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long as you're making money,</v>

1712
01:19:01.461 --> 01:19:04.160
<v Speaker 2>as long as the money's getting directed </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the right way.</v>

1713
01:19:04.430 --> 01:19:06.440
<v Speaker 2>People will let us talk about real </v>
<v Speaker 2>radical stuff.</v>

1714
01:19:06.441 --> 01:19:07.820
<v Speaker 2>They're quite comfortable for us to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1715
01:19:07.821 --> 01:19:10.530
<v Speaker 2>you should break down the system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should devolve at twilight,</v>

1716
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:11.810
<v Speaker 2>this conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas with geico,</v>

1717
01:19:11.830 --> 01:19:16.830
<v Speaker 2>p attachable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's an australian gay rights activist </v>

1718
01:19:16.830 --> 01:19:20.951
<v Speaker 2>who lives in the uk and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like when you're talking like this </v>

1719
01:19:20.951 --> 01:19:24.410
<v Speaker 2>with no disrespect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>disrespect for the great civil rights </v>

1720
01:19:24.410 --> 01:19:24.410
<v Speaker 2>heroes in the people that have had civil</v>
<v Speaker 2>rights struggles,</v>

1721
01:19:24.411 --> 01:19:29.411
<v Speaker 2>but he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's experienced as a gay rights </v>

1722
01:19:29.411 --> 01:19:29.411
<v Speaker 2>activist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

1723
01:19:29.411 --> 01:19:30.980
<v Speaker 2>in the end they will yield when it's to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do with those things,</v>

1724
01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:32.840
<v Speaker 2>your race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexuality.</v>

1725
01:19:32.841 --> 01:19:34.170
<v Speaker 2>People sort of know you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you,</v>

1726
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:35.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the system will use,</v>

1727
01:19:35.730 --> 01:19:36.530
<v Speaker 2>they will you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>

1728
01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:37.730
<v Speaker 2>Gay marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course.</v>

1729
01:19:37.731 --> 01:19:38.300
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1730
01:19:38.301 --> 01:19:38.840
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1731
01:19:38.841 --> 01:19:41.310
<v Speaker 2>we can't fucking have slavery in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>end.</v>

1732
01:19:41.350 --> 01:19:43.430
<v Speaker 2>And of course these monumental human </v>
<v Speaker 2>struggles.</v>

1733
01:19:43.431 --> 01:19:48.431
<v Speaker 2>I'm not diminishing them because.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you go near people's financial </v>

1734
01:19:48.431 --> 01:19:52.241
<v Speaker 2>interest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are fucked either they'll get you </v>

1735
01:19:52.241 --> 01:19:52.241
<v Speaker 2>there when you start saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1736
01:19:52.241 --> 01:19:53.930
<v Speaker 2>why don't we not pay our mortgages?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey everyone,</v>

1737
01:19:53.931 --> 01:19:58.120
<v Speaker 2>let's not pay tax to stop using oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1738
01:19:58.130 --> 01:19:59.650
<v Speaker 2>You fucking your out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1739
01:19:59.680 --> 01:20:01.670
<v Speaker 2>I see it so straight away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's sort of like,</v>

1740
01:20:01.671 --> 01:20:05.480
<v Speaker 2>this is what's interesting to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like was like these are the,</v>

1741
01:20:05.570 --> 01:20:08.040
<v Speaker 2>these are the access points,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are the points where</v>

1742
01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:10.170
<v Speaker 4>there is vulnerability.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not suggesting that we will organize</v>

1743
01:20:10.171 --> 01:20:15.171
<v Speaker 4>ourself into a radical crew of tax </v>
<v Speaker 4>avoiders or mortgage renegades or </v>

1744
01:20:15.721 --> 01:20:17.250
<v Speaker 4>wherever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but even though</v>

1745
01:20:17.930 --> 01:20:19.300
<v Speaker 3>are both doing well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're in,</v>

1746
01:20:19.340 --> 01:20:21.590
<v Speaker 3>like you said before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not in that weird,</v>

1747
01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:26.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>upper stratosphere where you're living </v>

1748
01:20:26.980 --> 01:20:30.611
<v Speaker 3>on the hamptons and some fucking hundred</v>
<v Speaker 3>acre ridiculous seaside mansion you </v>

1749
01:20:31.491 --> 01:20:36.491
<v Speaker 3>where your helicopter and private jet </v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere and you're worth </v>

1750
01:20:36.491 --> 01:20:38.240
<v Speaker 3>$100,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's a weird world.</v>

1751
01:20:38.270 --> 01:20:41.040
<v Speaker 3>That's a weird world that very few </v>
<v Speaker 3>people exist in.</v>

1752
01:20:41.090 --> 01:20:43.670
<v Speaker 3>Once they get there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't want to leave.</v>

1753
01:20:43.671 --> 01:20:45.920
<v Speaker 3>Once you start flying private </v>
<v Speaker 3>everywhere,</v>

1754
01:20:46.190 --> 01:20:49.160
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to leave.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Once you have a match and you don't want</v>

1755
01:20:49.161 --> 01:20:52.520
<v Speaker 3>a department,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you have a bentley,</v>

1756
01:20:52.521 --> 01:20:53.910
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>

1757
01:20:53.911 --> 01:20:56.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like nobody wants to go down.</v>

1758
01:20:56.151 --> 01:20:57.260
<v Speaker 3>You want to keep moving up.</v>

1759
01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:02.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's weird because those things </v>

1760
01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:02.480
<v Speaker 4>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They tend to happen in.</v>

1761
01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:05.270
<v Speaker 4>So if they haven't been in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you've got that money for </v>

1762
01:21:05.270 --> 01:21:05.270
<v Speaker 4>entertainment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe you're still sort of,</v>

1763
01:21:05.270 --> 01:21:09.471
<v Speaker 4>you've got some connection to your roots</v>
<v Speaker 4>and your entertainment and not maybe </v>

1764
01:21:09.471 --> 01:21:13.050
<v Speaker 4>you'll still connected to the source.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when it's in tech and finance,</v>

1765
01:21:13.051 --> 01:21:14.400
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got a vested interest.</v>

1766
01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:17.640
<v Speaker 4>My friend jason segel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the brilliant actor goes,</v>

1767

<v Speaker 4>you think all that stuff's about you,</v>

1769
01:21:20.461 --> 01:21:25.461
<v Speaker 4>the jets and the billboards and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's just the symptoms of other </v>

1770
01:21:25.461 --> 01:21:28.911
<v Speaker 4>people making money out of you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not that you have a tool in your </v>

1771
01:21:28.911 --> 01:21:28.911
<v Speaker 4>parlor machine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll be processed to be kicked out.</v>

1772
01:21:28.911 --> 01:21:30.360
<v Speaker 4>It's not a carousel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a train.</v>

1773
01:21:30.361 --> 01:21:33.540
<v Speaker 4>It will run out of energy and as soon as</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not providing your route.</v>

<v Speaker 4>infinite jest,</v>

1788
01:22:10.850 --> 01:22:15.850
<v Speaker 4>postulated a world where all stadiums </v>
<v Speaker 4>were named after brands were countries </v>

1789
01:22:15.850 --> 01:22:18.910
<v Speaker 4>and regions were named after brands,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's sort of happening.</v>

1790
01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:24.040
<v Speaker 4>It's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The flags of our nations are merely a </v>

1791
01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:26.840
<v Speaker 4>veil over the true corporate interests.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The british empire was always about east</v>

01:23:16.290 --> 01:23:17.960
<v Speaker 4>Would you mind to use it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'll just ask me.</v>

1813
01:23:18.140 --> 01:23:19.170
<v Speaker 4>Give me a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I my liquid.</v>

1815
01:23:22.491 --> 01:23:25.010

<v Speaker 4>data.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1817
01:23:26.530 --> 01:23:27.470
<v Speaker 4>One.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey.</v>

1818
01:23:27.471 --> 01:23:29.700
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I learned an important lesson of you and</v>

1819
01:23:29.701 --> 01:23:34.701
<v Speaker 4>this was it when I was a light came on </v>
<v Speaker 4>last time you were doing sort of a very </v>

1820
01:23:34.701 --> 01:23:39.551
<v Speaker 4>big a ufc event in I think vegas and my </v>
<v Speaker 4>mates,</v>

1821
01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:42.930
<v Speaker 4>like from the gym that I go to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>genesis theme,</v>

1822
01:23:42.970 --> 01:23:47.970
<v Speaker 4>I've already mentioned that they were </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming over for a stack though they </v>

1823
01:23:47.970 --> 01:23:47.970
<v Speaker 4>didn't ask me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I sort of thought,</v>

1824
01:23:47.970 --> 01:23:52.240
<v Speaker 4>oh listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could further inveigle myself into </v>

1825
01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:54.590
<v Speaker 4>this little crew of martial artist by </v>
<v Speaker 4>hooking them up with joe rogan tickets.</v>

1826
01:23:54.591 --> 01:23:55.190
<v Speaker 4>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1827
01:23:55.191 --> 01:23:56.330
<v Speaker 4>I'll do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like every,</v>

1828
01:23:56.340 --> 01:23:57.530
<v Speaker 4>the politician,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so forth.</v>

1829
01:23:57.531 --> 01:24:01.310
<v Speaker 4>So I text you a joe who hook up my mates</v>
<v Speaker 4>with this thing and he went,</v>

1830
01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:01.880
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1831
01:24:01.881 --> 01:24:03.830
<v Speaker 4>who are these people is important to </v>
<v Speaker 4>you?</v>

1832
01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:05.350
<v Speaker 4>And I took a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a form.</v>

1833
01:24:05.390 --> 01:24:09.320
<v Speaker 4>They are important and like them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but was my motivations here.</v>

1834
01:24:09.410 --> 01:24:10.970
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is a good thing.</v>

1835
01:24:10.971 --> 01:24:15.971
<v Speaker 4>I took a moment to reflect on it for </v>
<v Speaker 4>shayla do this will come up with </v>

1836
01:24:15.971 --> 01:24:15.971
<v Speaker 4>tickets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1837
01:24:15.971 --> 01:24:16.810
<v Speaker 4>maybe I'm doing this for the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 4>reasons.</v>

1838
01:24:16.820 --> 01:24:21.260
<v Speaker 4>I took a moment of rest are reflected.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't do it well it was a little less</v>

1839
01:24:21.261 --> 01:24:26.261
<v Speaker 4>than.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a little less than because you </v>

1840
01:24:26.261 --> 01:24:27.401
<v Speaker 4>gave me pause for rest by.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you were doing a standup show </v>

1841
01:24:27.401 --> 01:24:29.831
<v Speaker 4>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was to and they were already had </v>

1842
01:24:29.831 --> 01:24:29.831
<v Speaker 4>tickets for your standup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it was.</v>

1843
01:24:29.831 --> 01:24:33.300
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how could you give them backstage </v>

1844
01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:34.541
<v Speaker 4>passes?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And your answer wasn't an immediate ben </v>

1845
01:24:34.541 --> 01:24:34.541
<v Speaker 4>dover.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1846
01:24:34.541 --> 01:24:34.541
<v Speaker 4>of course I'll do what you want mr.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brand.</v>

1847
01:24:34.541 --> 01:24:37.970
<v Speaker 4>It was a bit more questioning like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well who are these guys?</v>

1848
01:24:38.350 --> 01:24:41.320
<v Speaker 3>The reason why I ask,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always ask is because sometimes people</v>

1849
01:24:41.321 --> 01:24:41.890
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1850
01:24:41.891 --> 01:24:44.830
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they've been bothering me about it.</v>

1851
01:24:44.831 --> 01:24:48.520
<v Speaker 3>It's a guy I work with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or people have said,</v>

1852
01:24:48.521 --> 01:24:49.710
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would you do this?</v>

1853
01:24:49.711 --> 01:24:51.340
<v Speaker 3>It's my best friend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love this guy.</v>

1854
01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:52.150
<v Speaker 3>And then I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1855
01:24:52.270 --> 01:24:53.220
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>

1856
01:24:53.230 --> 01:24:58.230
<v Speaker 3>so you give people little junction </v>
<v Speaker 3>because sometimes those people are </v>

1857
01:24:58.230 --> 01:25:01.141
<v Speaker 3>paying now because somebody might be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>pain in the ass to you and you might </v>

1858
01:25:01.141 --> 01:25:02.890
<v Speaker 3>just be getting in line and I didn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>know you as well,</v>

1859
01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:03.940
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I'm like,</v>

1860
01:25:03.941 --> 01:25:07.120
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I really admired the way you handled</v>

1861
01:25:07.121 --> 01:25:08.190
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I said,</v>

1862
01:25:08.210 --> 01:25:10.180
<v Speaker 3>do you want to give my number?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was the thing,</v>

1863
01:25:10.181 --> 01:25:12.070
<v Speaker 3>and you went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1864
01:25:13.020 --> 01:25:14.170
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I'll give him your number.</v>

1865
01:25:15.590 --> 01:25:20.590
<v Speaker 4>It seemed like I might be overcome me </v>
<v Speaker 4>and made me look at my own motivations </v>

1866
01:25:20.590 --> 01:25:24.430
<v Speaker 4>and I suppose that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anything that is called the great Carl </v>

1867
01:25:24.430 --> 01:25:24.430
<v Speaker 4>Young,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the mystic,</v>

1868
01:25:24.430 --> 01:25:29.291
<v Speaker 4>and one of the pioneers of </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychoanalysis said anything that </v>

1869
01:25:29.291 --> 01:25:29.720
<v Speaker 4>crosses your path that you didn't intend</v>
<v Speaker 4>for,</v>

1870
01:25:29.721 --> 01:25:32.810
<v Speaker 4>that is god in inverted commerce and </v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunity to learn.</v>

1871
01:25:32.990 --> 01:25:35.250
<v Speaker 4>So this is how I try to approach my life</v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

1872
01:25:35.251 --> 01:25:35.660
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hmm,</v>

1873
01:25:35.661 --> 01:25:38.090
<v Speaker 4>I didn't plan for that to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the lesson here?</v>

1874
01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:40.400
<v Speaker 4>What can I learn from this situation?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>

1875
01:25:40.401 --> 01:25:40.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anyway,</v>

1876
01:25:40.881 --> 01:25:42.620
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure damn guys would have been </v>
<v Speaker 4>fantastic.</v>

1877
01:25:42.621 --> 01:25:44.880
<v Speaker 4>I though they did later show me videos </v>
<v Speaker 4>of what went on.</v>

1878
01:25:44.930 --> 01:25:49.930
<v Speaker 4>I think it was just stack them and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were carrying on like idiots called up </v>

1879
01:25:49.930 --> 01:25:50.420
<v Speaker 4>and down corridors drunk at their mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So perhaps it was for the best,</v>

1880
01:25:50.750 --> 01:25:52.790
<v Speaker 4>but generally I'm sure that nothing </v>
<v Speaker 4>would have gone wrong.</v>

1881
01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:54.860
<v Speaker 4>But when I look at my own motivation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

1882
01:25:54.861 --> 01:25:57.260
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do you want to do this?</v>

1883
01:25:57.320 --> 01:25:59.540
<v Speaker 4>You're doing it a little bit because you</v>
<v Speaker 4>want to look cool.</v>

1884
01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:01.490
<v Speaker 4>Don't bother doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you know,</v>

1885
01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:06.520
<v Speaker 4>that's a little small in the way that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>walked the path for a small amendment </v>

1886
01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:08.510
<v Speaker 4>down a line.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I will ask again.</v>

1887
01:26:08.511 --> 01:26:09.110
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually joe,</v>

1888
01:26:09.111 --> 01:26:11.060
<v Speaker 4>could you sort these guys out with </v>
<v Speaker 4>tickets for this or that?</v>

1889
01:26:11.210 --> 01:26:13.790
<v Speaker 4>But I'll do it with the right </v>
<v Speaker 4>motivation,</v>

1890
01:26:13.970 --> 01:26:15.290
<v Speaker 4>the right connection.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>

1891
01:26:15.291 --> 01:26:20.291
<v Speaker 4>this again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as I keep saying this journey from </v>

1892
01:26:20.291 --> 01:26:21.620
<v Speaker 4>unconsciousness to consciousness is what</v>
<v Speaker 4>has been the myth of my own life.</v>

1893
01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:26.920
<v Speaker 4>I think we have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whether or not we're in just limitless </v>

1894
01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:27.020
<v Speaker 4>chaos in an ever expanding universe </v>
<v Speaker 4>without meaning,</v>

1895
01:26:27.021 --> 01:26:28.580
<v Speaker 4>without point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>without love,</v>

1896
01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:29.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it may be.</v>

1897
01:26:29.691 --> 01:26:32.540
<v Speaker 4>That is the way you know that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>people see the world that way.</v>

1898
01:26:32.540 --> 01:26:37.540
<v Speaker 4>It's not how I see the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see there as being meaning in </v>

1899
01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:37.540
<v Speaker 4>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>poetry and everything,</v>

1900
01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:39.050
<v Speaker 4>beauty in everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and certainly in my own life.</v>

1901
01:26:39.051 --> 01:26:42.620
<v Speaker 4>I like to find the story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What am I meant to learn here?</v>

1902
01:26:42.770 --> 01:26:46.130
<v Speaker 4>What am I meant to do here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did I learn from being ahead in the</v>

1903
01:26:46.140 --> 01:26:49.220
<v Speaker 4>story that I learned from being </v>
<v Speaker 4>promiscuous,</v>

1904
01:26:49.390 --> 01:26:53.300
<v Speaker 4>from being a drug addict and it all </v>
<v Speaker 4>seemed to make a kind of sense.</v>

1905
01:26:53.301 --> 01:26:57.590
<v Speaker 4>It all seems to be guiding me towards </v>
<v Speaker 4>something and that thing does seem to be</v>

1906
01:26:57.800 --> 01:26:59.240
<v Speaker 4>love,</v>
<v Speaker 4>service,</v>

1907
01:26:59.360 --> 01:27:00.920
<v Speaker 4>kindness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>awareness.</v>

1908
01:27:00.980 --> 01:27:03.910
<v Speaker 4>Not trying to manipulate people and not </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to get shit off people.</v>

1909
01:27:03.950 --> 01:27:08.950
<v Speaker 4>Time is a good journey and I feel like </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's sad if people don't get to do their</v>

1910
01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:13.990
<v Speaker 4>own version of that journey because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're on the cheese grater or because </v>

1911
01:27:13.990 --> 01:27:18.011
<v Speaker 4>they're pursuing some myths,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some code from their childhood that </v>

1912
01:27:18.011 --> 01:27:20.891
<v Speaker 4>they're not good enough or that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't deserve to be happy or they can't </v>

1913
01:27:20.891 --> 01:27:21.770
<v Speaker 4>achieve anything where whatever rung </v>
<v Speaker 4>their call on,</v>

1914
01:27:21.980 --> 01:27:26.980
<v Speaker 4>whether it's the wrong of booze or drugs</v>
<v Speaker 4>or the wrong of staring at social media </v>

1915
01:27:26.980 --> 01:27:30.641
<v Speaker 4>the whole time with the rung of hatred </v>
<v Speaker 4>of others or the wrong of being caught </v>

1916
01:27:30.641 --> 01:27:30.641
<v Speaker 4>in bad relationships and a crap job.</v>

1917
01:27:30.860 --> 01:27:35.860
<v Speaker 4>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that we can accelerate that </v>

1918
01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:38.531
<v Speaker 4>evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that there are codes that can </v>

1919
01:27:38.531 --> 01:27:40.571
<v Speaker 4>slip through and the same way that an </v>
<v Speaker 4>amazon can spring up in 15 years and be </v>

1920
01:27:40.571 --> 01:27:42.050
<v Speaker 4>this great economic monolift,</v>
<v Speaker 4>new ideas,</v>

1921
01:27:42.320 --> 01:27:46.340
<v Speaker 4>new faith's new ideologies can slip into</v>
<v Speaker 4>the net.</v>

1922
01:27:46.341 --> 01:27:48.650
<v Speaker 4>Particularly now we have this access to </v>
<v Speaker 4>technology.</v>

1923
01:27:48.651 --> 01:27:53.651
<v Speaker 4>You've slipped past the gatekeepers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have your own media empire out of </v>

1924
01:27:53.651 --> 01:27:53.651
<v Speaker 4>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1925
01:27:53.651 --> 01:27:57.380
<v Speaker 4>and you've limited it because it's too </v>
<v Speaker 4>you built around you as an individual in</v>

1926
01:27:57.381 --> 01:27:58.520
<v Speaker 4>your perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 4>et cetera.</v>

1927
01:27:58.850 --> 01:28:03.850
<v Speaker 4>But these are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are ways now of getting </v>

1928
01:28:03.850 --> 01:28:03.850
<v Speaker 4>information out there that excites me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1929
01:28:03.850 --> 01:28:04.750
<v Speaker 3>And They should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1930
01:28:04.751 --> 01:28:09.751
<v Speaker 3>and what we were talking about too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about being a hedonist and doing things </v>

1931
01:28:09.751 --> 01:28:11.860
<v Speaker 3>wrong and fucking up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what can you learn from them?</v>

1932
01:28:12.130 --> 01:28:17.130
<v Speaker 3>I think every time you fuck something up</v>
<v Speaker 3>and every time you do something badly </v>

1933
01:28:17.130 --> 01:28:17.920
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lesson that you get out of the</v>

1934
01:28:17.921 --> 01:28:21.130
<v Speaker 3>weird feelings of failure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of discontent.</v>

1935
01:28:21.131 --> 01:28:23.710
<v Speaker 3>And those lessons are extremely </v>
<v Speaker 3>valuable.</v>

1936
01:28:24.010 --> 01:28:26.140
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a person who doesn't make mistakes and a</v>

1937
01:28:26.141 --> 01:28:28.810
<v Speaker 3>person who doesn't do anything wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they never learned shit.</v>

1938
01:28:28.811 --> 01:28:31.300
<v Speaker 3>You don't learn anything from doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything perfectly.</v>

1939
01:28:31.301 --> 01:28:36.301
<v Speaker 3>every time it doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one knew no one and the more bold and</v>

1940
01:28:36.311 --> 01:28:41.311
<v Speaker 3>brash you are and the more you take </v>
<v Speaker 3>chances and the more you put yourself </v>

1941
01:28:41.621 --> 01:28:44.190
<v Speaker 3>into these weird positions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even in these like,</v>

1942
01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:45.780
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure when you're,</v>

1943
01:28:45.781 --> 01:28:50.781
<v Speaker 3>you were a sex addict and you're in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>hedonistic whirlwind experience,</v>

1944
01:28:51.160 --> 01:28:56.160
<v Speaker 3>you're still,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're taking in all this data and </v>

1945
01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:59.521
<v Speaker 3>you're taking all this in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the hollow feeling that you had that </v>

1946
01:28:59.521 --> 01:29:02.191
<v Speaker 3>you didn't like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is what propelled you to your new </v>

1947
01:29:02.191 --> 01:29:02.191
<v Speaker 3>stage of once you</v>

1948
01:29:02.191 --> 01:29:03.360
<v Speaker 4>emerge from it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1949
01:29:03.361 --> 01:29:08.361
<v Speaker 4>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every so often because it's like </v>

1950
01:29:08.361 --> 01:29:08.930
<v Speaker 4>pleasure laden an orgy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's the point of view.</v>

1951
01:29:08.970 --> 01:29:10.770
<v Speaker 4>I mean this flesh everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's this bits of it.</v>

1952
01:29:10.771 --> 01:29:12.690
<v Speaker 4>They're brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was no in,</v>

1953
01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:17.720
<v Speaker 4>hold on a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This isn't working and this is a thing </v>

1954
01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:17.720
<v Speaker 4>that I thought would really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really work,</v>

1955
01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:18.540
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like sometimes the,</v>

1956
01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:23.640
<v Speaker 4>the great gift of promiscuity is you get</v>
<v Speaker 4>to experience the intimacy with all of </v>

1957
01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:27.711
<v Speaker 4>these strangers and it seemed exciting </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the type of sexuality that I've </v>

1958
01:29:27.711 --> 01:29:30.420
<v Speaker 4>always had is more about worship than </v>
<v Speaker 4>any kind of domination I adore.</v>

1959
01:29:30.421 --> 01:29:31.740
<v Speaker 4>I adore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1960
01:29:31.741 --> 01:29:33.330
<v Speaker 4>so it's not about like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to control you,</v>

1961
01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:37.290
<v Speaker 4>so by like all these wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 4>experiences and encounters,</v>

1962
01:29:37.530 --> 01:29:42.530
<v Speaker 4>but within it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this kind of ongoing seem of loneliness </v>

1963
01:29:42.530 --> 01:29:45.150
<v Speaker 4>and ignorable and also this is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing,</v>

1964
01:29:45.270 --> 01:29:50.270
<v Speaker 4>when you get the things your culture </v>
<v Speaker 4>tells you you should be doing and you </v>

1965
01:29:50.270 --> 01:29:53.601
<v Speaker 4>experience them now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now you know you can stop chasing the </v>

1966
01:29:53.601 --> 01:29:53.850
<v Speaker 4>carrot because you've had a bite out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1967
01:29:53.850 --> 01:29:54.330
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1968
01:29:54.350 --> 01:29:55.920
<v Speaker 4>mini bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you know,</v>

1969
01:29:56.110 --> 01:30:01.110
<v Speaker 4>not an,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a hard one to learn because </v>

1970
01:30:01.110 --> 01:30:01.110
<v Speaker 4>anything that's got an orgasm at the end</v>
<v Speaker 4>of it,</v>

1971
01:30:01.110 --> 01:30:01.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a degree of pleasure to be had,</v>

1972
01:30:01.980 --> 01:30:04.620
<v Speaker 4>but it takes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it takes a while to recognize what this,</v>

1973
01:30:04.710 --> 01:30:07.440
<v Speaker 4>the emotional cost or made a spiritual </v>
<v Speaker 4>cost on other people.</v>

1974
01:30:07.620 --> 01:30:09.930
<v Speaker 4>The fact that it's prevented me from </v>
<v Speaker 4>becoming a father,</v>

1975
01:30:09.931 --> 01:30:12.010
<v Speaker 4>from becoming a husband,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from berlin,</v>

1976
01:30:12.030 --> 01:30:14.740
<v Speaker 4>from becoming rooted from becoming </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually whole,</v>

1977
01:30:14.741 --> 01:30:16.890
<v Speaker 4>from becoming a man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from becoming connected.</v>

1978
01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:22.270
<v Speaker 4>It takes a while to spot that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of people don't get the </v>

1979
01:30:22.270 --> 01:30:23.220
<v Speaker 4>opportunity to break out that pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would never have spotted it.</v>

1980
01:30:23.310 --> 01:30:25.410
<v Speaker 4>Had a not first being a heroin addict </v>
<v Speaker 4>and got,</v>

1981
01:30:25.411 --> 01:30:27.030
<v Speaker 4>hold on a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're doing that thing again.</v>

1982
01:30:27.240 --> 01:30:30.480
<v Speaker 4>Same with fame and celebrity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well toxic,</v>

1983
01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:35.560
<v Speaker 4>well toxic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exciting and brilliant and loads of </v>

1984
01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:35.560
<v Speaker 4>lovely people in there.</v>

1985
01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:35.560
<v Speaker 4>And I still like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1986
01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:36.630
<v Speaker 4>I might make another film,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what happened,</v>

1987
01:30:36.810 --> 01:30:40.950
<v Speaker 4>but like it's because I'd had the </v>
<v Speaker 4>template and the experiences of awe,</v>

1988
01:30:40.951 --> 01:30:45.951
<v Speaker 4>this is addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're expecting this thing to make you </v>

1989
01:30:45.951 --> 01:30:48.291
<v Speaker 4>feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now what's happened is I am as a </v>

1990
01:30:48.291 --> 01:30:50.961
<v Speaker 4>baseline disabused of the idea that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>material world will give me anything </v>

1991
01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:56.000
<v Speaker 4>that it will ever fulfill me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I am responsible for my own </v>

1992
01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:00.291
<v Speaker 4>connection and that my role here is to </v>
<v Speaker 4>serve other people and help them in if </v>

1993
01:31:00.540 --> 01:31:04.890
<v Speaker 4>my objective in life is or what can I do</v>
<v Speaker 4>to augment myself to make myself better.</v>

1994
01:31:05.030 --> 01:31:05.700
<v Speaker 4>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1995
01:31:05.730 --> 01:31:08.190
<v Speaker 4>even self improvement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree with all of that.</v>

1996
01:31:08.191 --> 01:31:09.480
<v Speaker 4>I agree with entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's brilliant,</v>

1997
01:31:09.481 --> 01:31:10.980
<v Speaker 4>brilliant thing and it's necessary I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think,</v>

1998
01:31:11.220 --> 01:31:15.540
<v Speaker 4>but like in order that I may be of </v>
<v Speaker 4>service to others rather than.</v>

1999
01:31:15.670 --> 01:31:18.210
<v Speaker 4>Because then I'll just look great in </v>
<v Speaker 4>this arm chair ranking.</v>

2000
01:31:18.210 --> 01:31:22.770
<v Speaker 4>Self improvement is about being better </v>
<v Speaker 4>at what fulfills you the most,</v>

2001
01:31:22.771 --> 01:31:25.020
<v Speaker 4>which is almost always establishing </v>
<v Speaker 4>community.</v>

2002
01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:30.440
<v Speaker 4>So don't you think then joe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we could do something that's a bit </v>

2003
01:31:30.440 --> 01:31:32.961
<v Speaker 4>more explicitly that from the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You already have this huge community </v>

2004
01:31:32.961 --> 01:31:37.460
<v Speaker 4>there around the joe rogan experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is there something in it bother you?</v>

2005
01:31:38.180 --> 01:31:41.160
<v Speaker 4>Like couldn't there be something that </v>
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't cost you that much?</v>

2006
01:31:41.161 --> 01:31:43.440
<v Speaker 4>That might be sort of wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Didn't do these things,</v>

2007
01:31:43.441 --> 01:31:45.090
<v Speaker 4>not float into your world,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and people go,</v>

2008
01:31:45.091 --> 01:31:46.200
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're an influential figure.</v>

2009
01:31:46.201 --> 01:31:48.970
<v Speaker 4>You're unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have this strong male energy.</v>

2010
01:31:48.990 --> 01:31:53.990
<v Speaker 4>Be very open to learning and very open </v>
<v Speaker 4>to it and you're like,</v>

2011
01:31:54.241 --> 01:31:55.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree with you.</v>

2012
01:31:55.040 --> 01:31:56.850
<v Speaker 4>A left wing categories right when </v>
<v Speaker 4>categories,</v>

2013
01:31:56.851 --> 01:32:01.851
<v Speaker 4>that shit's all got to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think that there's a real </v>

2014
01:32:01.851 --> 01:32:03.010
<v Speaker 4>opportunity for you to have a huge </v>
<v Speaker 4>impact on communities.</v>

2015
01:32:03.011 --> 01:32:05.530
<v Speaker 4>They're very neglected.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Young males,</v>

2016
01:32:05.531 --> 01:32:08.890
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not knowing how to use their bodies,</v>

2017
01:32:08.891 --> 01:32:12.010
<v Speaker 4>young males are that violence is </v>
<v Speaker 4>becoming a problem for.</v>

2018
01:32:12.100 --> 01:32:17.100
<v Speaker 4>there's not that many people that are in</v>
<v Speaker 4>as powerful position as you to sort of </v>

2019
01:32:17.100 --> 01:32:19.630
<v Speaker 4>the wrecks to them in a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that something that you know about?</v>

2020
01:32:19.631 --> 01:32:22.360
<v Speaker 4>Is that something that's come into your </v>
<v Speaker 4>orbit?</v>

2021
01:32:22.810 --> 01:32:23.140
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2022
01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:25.490
<v Speaker 3>you're doing it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2023
01:32:25.491 --> 01:32:29.030
<v Speaker 3>you're doing it right now about </v>
<v Speaker 3>communicating in a way that you're going</v>

2024
01:32:29.031 --> 01:32:31.490
<v Speaker 3>to get to way more people than you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to do it in a physical sense.</v>

2025
01:32:31.870 --> 01:32:36.870
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by spreading these ideas and </v>

2026
01:32:36.870 --> 01:32:37.880
<v Speaker 3>communicating online in a podcast and </v>
<v Speaker 3>allowing people to download it for free.</v>

2027
01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:43.120
<v Speaker 3>Getting into your phone and your head </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know you're jogging and you're </v>

2028
01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:47.380
<v Speaker 3>driving your car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're getting ideas and the way more </v>

2029
01:32:47.380 --> 01:32:50.591
<v Speaker 3>people's heads and you ever would by </v>
<v Speaker 3>physically being there physically being </v>

2030
01:32:50.591 --> 01:32:50.720
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's very retro.</v>

2031
01:32:53.630 --> 01:32:54.680
<v Speaker 3>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2032
01:32:54.681 --> 01:32:57.050
<v Speaker 3>you can only be there for so many people</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what are you going to do?</v>

2033
01:32:57.051 --> 01:32:58.080
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could.</v>

2034
01:32:58.170 --> 01:33:03.170
<v Speaker 3>I do comedy shows for a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I mean physically being there and </v>

2035
01:33:03.170 --> 01:33:04.250
<v Speaker 3>doing something and organizing some sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of thing.</v>

2036
01:33:04.490 --> 01:33:08.880
<v Speaker 3>That's what you venture into some weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>cult thing that's for the culture.</v>

2037
01:33:08.950 --> 01:33:13.950
<v Speaker 3>Shit gets slippery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's covered in baby oil and you </v>

2038
01:33:13.950 --> 01:33:14.200
<v Speaker 3>just fucking trying to grip nothing.</v>

2039
01:33:14.330 --> 01:33:16.370
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're in a jungle now.</v>

2040
01:33:18.220 --> 01:33:23.220
<v Speaker 4>Massively side may be a right job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's an interesting thing to </v>

2041
01:33:23.391 --> 01:33:28.391
<v Speaker 4>observe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do think that's right and it made a </v>

2042
01:33:28.391 --> 01:33:28.391
<v Speaker 4>lot of people in england like the go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2043
01:33:28.391 --> 01:33:28.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I heard you on joe rogan.</v>

2044
01:33:28.830 --> 01:33:33.830
<v Speaker 4>I listen to joe rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People talk about it and it's </v>

2045
01:33:33.830 --> 01:33:35.711
<v Speaker 4>interesting because it's different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it's accessing information that </v>

2046
01:33:35.711 --> 01:33:40.061
<v Speaker 4>people would not have always been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People come for the fight stuff or come </v>

2047
01:33:40.061 --> 01:33:41.150
<v Speaker 4>for the entertainers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then they're getting hit with graham</v>

2048
01:33:41.151 --> 01:33:46.151
<v Speaker 4>hancock or some neurologist or wherever </v>
<v Speaker 4>the behavioralist or wherever is a good </v>

2049
01:33:46.151 --> 01:33:47.030
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2050
01:33:47.031 --> 01:33:47.320
<v Speaker 4>I think</v>

2051
01:33:47.380 --> 01:33:50.260
<v Speaker 3>the wide variety of guests is very </v>
<v Speaker 3>important too,</v>

2052
01:33:50.290 --> 01:33:55.290
<v Speaker 3>for me personally because otherwise I'd </v>
<v Speaker 3>get bored if I only talk to comedians </v>

2053
01:33:55.290 --> 01:33:56.020
<v Speaker 3>are only talked to mma fighters or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

2054
01:33:56.021 --> 01:33:58.120
<v Speaker 3>or even only cocked to scientist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd get bored.</v>

2055
01:33:58.380 --> 01:33:59.140
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>

2056
01:33:59.410 --> 01:34:01.300
<v Speaker 3>I like talking to a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

2057
01:34:01.301 --> 01:34:02.860
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't plan any of this.</v>

2058
01:34:02.861 --> 01:34:07.861
<v Speaker 3>So the way that sort of an an folded is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is been pretty organic to use an </v>

2059
01:34:10.601 --> 01:34:11.150
<v Speaker 3>overused.</v>

2060
01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:18.240
<v Speaker 4>tell me please just briefly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is there something about the phenomena </v>

2061
01:34:18.240 --> 01:34:21.040
<v Speaker 4>of conor mcgregor that is unique?</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is it that is happening?</v>

2062
01:34:21.190 --> 01:34:23.620
<v Speaker 4>What has happened with him?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does he mean?</v>

2063
01:34:23.621 --> 01:34:28.621
<v Speaker 4>What does he mean into ufc?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What happens to him now that I'll post </v>

2064
01:34:28.800 --> 01:34:33.800
<v Speaker 4>mayweather fight?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is he an example of sort of an </v>

2065
01:34:33.800 --> 01:34:33.850
<v Speaker 4>outlier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a pioneer?</v>

2066
01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:36.580
<v Speaker 4>How will he be regarded?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does he represent?</v>

2067
01:34:36.581 --> 01:34:38.680
<v Speaker 4>Is he an entertainment product?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Easy.</v>

2068
01:34:38.681 --> 01:34:41.410
<v Speaker 4>A great athlete is a combination of all </v>
<v Speaker 4>those things.</v>

2069
01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:46.560
<v Speaker 4>What does he mean for the sport of ufc </v>
<v Speaker 4>and what do you think will happen in </v>

2070
01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:50.880
<v Speaker 4>mixed martial arts and boxing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think we'll see more of those </v>

2071
01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:50.880
<v Speaker 4>kinds of events?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2072
01:34:50.880 --> 01:34:52.270
<v Speaker 4>you never going to see another one like </v>
<v Speaker 4>him,</v>

2073
01:34:52.330 --> 01:34:53.640
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because he's a unique</v>

2074
01:34:53.730 --> 01:34:54.380
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's.</v>

2075
01:34:54.410 --> 01:34:59.410
<v Speaker 3>He's literally being himself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're going see a bunch of people try </v>

2076
01:34:59.410 --> 01:35:03.341
<v Speaker 3>to mimic that and in a sense he sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>mimicked the people that came before </v>

2077
01:35:03.341 --> 01:35:07.811
<v Speaker 3>him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the chill sonance and the muhammad </v>

2078
01:35:07.811 --> 01:35:07.811
<v Speaker 3>ali's and the people that were really </v>
<v Speaker 3>good at talking shit.</v>

2079
01:35:08.060 --> 01:35:11.570
<v Speaker 3>The difference is that what connor's </v>
<v Speaker 3>been able to do,</v>

2080
01:35:11.571 --> 01:35:14.930
<v Speaker 3>he's the first guy in the ufc that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>been able to do that,</v>

2081
01:35:14.931 --> 01:35:19.931
<v Speaker 3>that's had spectacular results and also </v>
<v Speaker 3>showed his real character in losing and </v>

2082
01:35:21.351 --> 01:35:26.351
<v Speaker 3>then coming back and winning very </v>
<v Speaker 3>quickly afterwards at the same guy like </v>

2083
01:35:26.351 --> 01:35:30.131
<v Speaker 3>the nate diaz fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that was a very important </v>

2084
01:35:30.131 --> 01:35:31.850
<v Speaker 3>character exposing fight because he lost</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fight.</v>

2085
01:35:31.851 --> 01:35:36.851
<v Speaker 3>He got humbled and then he jumped right </v>
<v Speaker 3>back on the horse and then wound up </v>

2086
01:35:36.851 --> 01:35:38.900
<v Speaker 3>winning and then he comes back and blows</v>
<v Speaker 3>eddie alvarez out of the water to become</v>

2087
01:35:38.901 --> 01:35:43.250
<v Speaker 3>the first two division concurrent </v>
<v Speaker 3>champion in the sport.</v>

2088
01:35:43.490 --> 01:35:48.490
<v Speaker 3>I think he's a unique guy in a very.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's almost like we don't have a word </v>

2089
01:35:48.591 --> 01:35:53.591
<v Speaker 3>strong enough.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unique is not really a strong enough </v>

2090
01:35:53.591 --> 01:35:55.991
<v Speaker 3>word.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he is founded on a belief in a very </v>

2091
01:35:55.991 --> 01:35:55.991
<v Speaker 3>basic way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got brilliant,</v>

2092
01:35:55.991 --> 01:35:56.700
<v Speaker 3>brilliant ability,</v>
<v Speaker 3>massive.</v>

2093
01:35:56.780 --> 01:36:01.780
<v Speaker 3>He's incredibly smart and a very.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's very innovative in his techniques </v>

2094
01:36:03.141 --> 01:36:05.370
<v Speaker 3>and his approaches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

2095
01:36:05.540 --> 01:36:09.620
<v Speaker 3>I think he has phenomenal coaching as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

2096
01:36:09.630 --> 01:36:12.770
<v Speaker 3>And animal movements.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fuck is that walk well,</v>

2097
01:36:12.771 --> 01:36:14.690
<v Speaker 3>he's just getting that thing that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>does.</v>

2098
01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:19.720
<v Speaker 3>He throws his name doesn't mean anything</v>
<v Speaker 3>loose.</v>

2099
01:36:20.300 --> 01:36:24.680
<v Speaker 3>He's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He cocking okay.</v>

2100
01:36:24.900 --> 01:36:29.900
<v Speaker 3>When I come out and stay sometimes it </v>
<v Speaker 3>says just an amazing thing to do with </v>

2101
01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:30.290
<v Speaker 3>the body heat cooking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You say cocky.</v>

2102
01:36:30.430 --> 01:36:31.340
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>

2103
01:36:31.341 --> 01:36:33.200
<v Speaker 3>these guys fucking out and look what </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's doing.</v>

2104
01:36:33.260 --> 01:36:35.360
<v Speaker 3>He's letting the other guy know that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>so loose.</v>

2105
01:36:35.370 --> 01:36:39.170
<v Speaker 3>You can kind of struck with his arms </v>
<v Speaker 3>like rubber bands flying around,</v>

2106
01:36:39.710 --> 01:36:41.600
<v Speaker 3>but I mean he's a combination of a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of things.</v>

2107
01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:46.600
<v Speaker 3>He has a brilliant team.</v>
<v Speaker 3>John kavanagh is coach is a brilliant </v>

2108
01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:46.600
<v Speaker 3>coach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's got,</v>

2109
01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:47.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing jujitsu,</v>

2110
01:36:47.450 --> 01:36:50.480
<v Speaker 3>coaching and striking coaching in his </v>
<v Speaker 3>mind.</v>

2111
01:36:50.481 --> 01:36:53.060
<v Speaker 3>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he understands how to apply these things</v>

2112
01:36:53.180 --> 01:36:55.110
<v Speaker 3>and his ability to perform under </v>
<v Speaker 3>pressure.</v>

2113
01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:58.460
<v Speaker 3>This is fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You saw that in the mayweather fight.</v>

2114
01:36:58.790 --> 01:37:03.790
<v Speaker 3>I mean even though he lost that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he hit me with some pretty good shots </v>

2115
01:37:03.790 --> 01:37:07.790
<v Speaker 3>and he won the first three rounds </v>
<v Speaker 3>against the greatest boxer of all time.</v>

2116
01:37:07.850 --> 01:37:09.500
<v Speaker 3>So then the extraordinary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>extraordinary.</v>

2117
01:37:09.501 --> 01:37:14.501
<v Speaker 3>I mean you can say easily that made </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it was taking those rounds off </v>

2118
01:37:14.501 --> 01:37:14.501
<v Speaker 3>and I agree he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you could say that may,</v>

2119
01:37:14.501 --> 01:37:19.341
<v Speaker 3>whether it was bringing them to deep </v>
<v Speaker 3>water because he knew it would exhaust </v>

2120
01:37:19.341 --> 01:37:21.841
<v Speaker 3>him because he didn't give him enough </v>
<v Speaker 3>time to train for it because you really </v>

2121
01:37:21.841 --> 01:37:21.841
<v Speaker 3>only gave them two months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was very brilliant.</v>

2122
01:37:21.841 --> 01:37:22.760
<v Speaker 3>I made with his part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knew that he wouldn't be efficient.</v>

2123
01:37:22.761 --> 01:37:25.280
<v Speaker 3>He would tire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although as a kinetic,</v>

2124
01:37:25.281 --> 01:37:29.510
<v Speaker 3>big explosive movements at conor likes </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do their very taxing and he knew that</v>

2125
01:37:29.630 --> 01:37:34.630
<v Speaker 3>he was not going to have the efficiency </v>
<v Speaker 3>to go 12 hard rounds with a master </v>

2126
01:37:34.630 --> 01:37:35.900
<v Speaker 3>defensive fighter like mayweather and </v>
<v Speaker 3>made whether it was right,</v>

2127
01:37:36.260 --> 01:37:38.870
<v Speaker 3>but he didn't want to get hit with that </v>
<v Speaker 3>upper cut that he got cracked within the</v>

2128
01:37:38.871 --> 01:37:43.871
<v Speaker 3>first round.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't want to to to like connor's </v>

2129
01:37:43.871 --> 01:37:47.090
<v Speaker 3>movement was very unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It took floyd a while to decipher.</v>

2130
01:37:47.091 --> 01:37:52.091
<v Speaker 3>It has been way better for him if he </v>
<v Speaker 3>just blew connor out of the water from </v>

2131
01:37:52.091 --> 01:37:53.780
<v Speaker 3>one round on and just completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>outclassed him.</v>

2132
01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:58.960
<v Speaker 3>But he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the reasons why I didn't is </v>

2133
01:37:58.960 --> 01:37:59.250
<v Speaker 3>because connor's an extraordinary person</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he has greatness.</v>

2134
01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:04.820
<v Speaker 3>Greatness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he didn't really have the proper </v>

2135
01:38:04.820 --> 01:38:07.161
<v Speaker 3>opportunity in only being able to </v>
<v Speaker 3>prepare for two months and only having </v>

2136
01:38:07.161 --> 01:38:08.670
<v Speaker 3>this one professional boxing match.</v>

2137
01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:12.060
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot of things stacked </v>
<v Speaker 3>against him and yet I feel,</v>

2138
01:38:12.061 --> 01:38:14.910
<v Speaker 3>although he clearly lost,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he performed admirably.</v>

2139
01:38:15.270 --> 01:38:17.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it hurts his stock in any </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

2140
01:38:17.491 --> 01:38:21.180
<v Speaker 3>I think it elevates them and I think his</v>
<v Speaker 3>next fight in the ufc,</v>

2141
01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:26.440
<v Speaker 3>a whoever it would will be will be </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably the biggest fight in ufc </v>

2142
01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:28.020
<v Speaker 3>history if they can do it correctly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>depending upon who it is,</v>

2143
01:38:28.170 --> 01:38:33.170
<v Speaker 3>especially if it's nate diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nate diaz is a huge name and if nate </v>

2144
01:38:33.170 --> 01:38:34.260
<v Speaker 3>diaz and him decided to do it one more </v>
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>

2145
01:38:34.290 --> 01:38:37.200
<v Speaker 3>I think that would be the biggest fight </v>
<v Speaker 3>ever in the historY of the sport because</v>

2146
01:38:37.201 --> 01:38:39.870
<v Speaker 3>I think connor has eclipsed the sport </v>
<v Speaker 3>largely,</v>

2147
01:38:40.170 --> 01:38:40.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

2148
01:38:40.601 --> 01:38:45.601
<v Speaker 3>and maybe for now maybe someone else </v>
<v Speaker 3>will come along in the next year or two </v>

2149
01:38:45.601 --> 01:38:45.690
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that does it.</v>

2150
01:38:45.780 --> 01:38:48.000
<v Speaker 3>I mean look has only been around for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>few years.</v>

2151
01:38:48.390 --> 01:38:53.390
<v Speaker 3>I tweeted to him in 2013 or 14,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget what it was when he had won a </v>

2152
01:38:55.261 --> 01:39:00.261
<v Speaker 3>big fight in the uk and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>congratulations on an amazing </v>

2153
01:39:00.261 --> 01:39:00.261
<v Speaker 3>performance.</v>

2154
01:39:00.261 --> 01:39:02.970
<v Speaker 3>I really hope to see in the ufc someday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was like four years ago.</v>

2155
01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:04.290
<v Speaker 3>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The most.</v>

2156
01:39:04.470 --> 01:39:09.470
<v Speaker 3>So in four years he's gone from being </v>
<v Speaker 3>this unknown fighter that only like the </v>

2157
01:39:09.470 --> 01:39:13.340
<v Speaker 3>really hardcore fanatics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like myself knew about to him being this</v>

2158
01:39:14.190 --> 01:39:19.110
<v Speaker 3>worldwide phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's the biggest combat sport athlete,</v>

2159
01:39:19.111 --> 01:39:20.850
<v Speaker 3>not just of today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever.</v>

2160
01:39:21.180 --> 01:39:23.670
<v Speaker 3>There's no one like him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one like him,</v>

2161
01:39:23.671 --> 01:39:26.010
<v Speaker 3>no one that has the kind of popularity </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he has.</v>

2162
01:39:26.220 --> 01:39:31.220
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this fucking guy has thousands and </v>

2163
01:39:31.220 --> 01:39:32.400
<v Speaker 3>thousands of people fly from Ireland to </v>
<v Speaker 3>vegas.</v>

2164
01:39:32.401 --> 01:39:35.880
<v Speaker 3>Every time he fights the weigh ins.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like you're in dublin.</v>

2165
01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:37.740
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking crazy,</v>

2166
01:39:37.741 --> 01:39:39.150
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you look out,</v>

2167
01:39:39.151 --> 01:39:41.730
<v Speaker 3>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I interview him at the weigh ins in</v>

2168
01:39:41.731 --> 01:39:43.560
<v Speaker 3>the ufc in vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you look out,</v>

2169
01:39:43.561 --> 01:39:48.561
<v Speaker 3>you see nothing but irish flags.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see people screaming and cheering </v>

2170
01:39:48.561 --> 01:39:50.280
<v Speaker 3>and singing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mandalay bay during the floyd mayweather</v>

2171
01:39:50.281 --> 01:39:55.281
<v Speaker 3>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is not even the venue where the </v>

2172
01:39:55.281 --> 01:39:55.320
<v Speaker 3>fight was being held.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mandalay bay was packed.</v>

2173
01:39:55.500 --> 01:39:59.790
<v Speaker 3>Bumper to bumper with irishman walking </v>
<v Speaker 3>down the hallway,</v>

2174
01:39:59.880 --> 01:40:04.110
<v Speaker 3>cheering and singing songs in sync.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was insane.</v>

2175
01:40:04.390 --> 01:40:06.150
<v Speaker 3>Brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no one like him.</v>

2176
01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:06.880
<v Speaker 4>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

2177
01:40:06.881 --> 01:40:09.430
<v Speaker 4>you have to have the greatness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we've had the greatest.</v>

2178
01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:14.440
<v Speaker 4>Who gives a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's just another person because like I </v>

2179
01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:14.440
<v Speaker 4>said about van gough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2180
01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:14.440
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2181
01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:18.550
<v Speaker 4>it gives a fuck if you cut your ear off,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you paint paintings,</v>

2182
01:40:18.551 --> 01:40:20.950
<v Speaker 4>have god be good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>game is good,</v>

2183
01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:25.360
<v Speaker 4>but then like the law,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are often great geniuses in sport,</v>

2184
01:40:25.361 --> 01:40:26.710
<v Speaker 4>but to have that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you say,</v>

2185
01:40:26.711 --> 01:40:31.711
<v Speaker 4>this fall that he used like that </v>
<v Speaker 4>romantic ideas of Ireland and he's an </v>

2186
01:40:31.961 --> 01:40:36.961
<v Speaker 4>irish ness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that became an important part of his </v>

2187
01:40:36.961 --> 01:40:36.961
<v Speaker 4>perception,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's obviously resonating in a very,</v>

2188
01:40:36.961 --> 01:40:40.420
<v Speaker 4>very powerful way to have that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>devotion or Ireland.</v>

2189
01:40:40.421 --> 01:40:40.530
<v Speaker 4>Ireland's</v>

2190
01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:45.550
<v Speaker 3>very important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ireland's a very important part of the </v>

2191
01:40:45.550 --> 01:40:48.101
<v Speaker 3>equation as well because their </v>
<v Speaker 3>appreciation and love and support of </v>

2192
01:40:48.261 --> 01:40:49.550
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's unprecedented.</v>

2193
01:40:49.940 --> 01:40:54.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen brazilian fans that love josie</v>

2194
01:40:54.311 --> 01:40:58.030
<v Speaker 3>aldo and I've seen brazilian fans that </v>
<v Speaker 3>love anderson silva and you know,</v>

2195
01:40:58.031 --> 01:41:03.031
<v Speaker 3>the worshiped by their countrymen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it pales in comparison to the amount</v>

2196
01:41:03.581 --> 01:41:05.050
<v Speaker 3>of love that conor mcgregor gatz.</v>

2197
01:41:05.190 --> 01:41:09.000
<v Speaker 4>I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then then myth aligns with his myth,</v>

2198
01:41:09.030 --> 01:41:14.030
<v Speaker 4>the myth of the irish people as being </v>
<v Speaker 4>oppressed by british colonialism and </v>

2199
01:41:14.030 --> 01:41:17.841
<v Speaker 4>having to fight for their freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It resonates with what this man </v>

2200
01:41:17.841 --> 01:41:21.210
<v Speaker 4>represents and perhaps this is always </v>
<v Speaker 4>what happens with figures of greatness,</v>

2201
01:41:21.211 --> 01:41:24.810
<v Speaker 4>whether it's within the realm of sport </v>
<v Speaker 4>or within the realm of politics,</v>

2202
01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:28.200
<v Speaker 4>temporarily a person sort of captures a </v>
<v Speaker 4>particular mood,</v>

2203
01:41:28.201 --> 01:41:30.060
<v Speaker 4>a particular energy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is what I think again,</v>

2204
01:41:30.061 --> 01:41:33.410
<v Speaker 4>is to do with unconsciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think people are go like a con,</v>

2205
01:41:33.480 --> 01:41:35.550
<v Speaker 4>like are aware of these kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 4>feelings.</v>

2206
01:41:35.551 --> 01:41:38.990
<v Speaker 4>I think it's stimulated on a level </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not about for.</v>

2207
01:41:39.270 --> 01:41:44.270
<v Speaker 4>This is one of the things I'm very </v>
<v Speaker 4>interested in what lies beyond the </v>

2208
01:41:44.270 --> 01:41:44.270
<v Speaker 4>rational.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2209
01:41:44.270 --> 01:41:45.000
<v Speaker 4>what lexia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can equate,</v>

2210
01:41:45.001 --> 01:41:45.930
<v Speaker 4>we can work out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can just.</v>

2211
01:41:45.931 --> 01:41:50.931
<v Speaker 4>But there seems to be some ingredient </v>
<v Speaker 4>even in conor mcgregor that you can't </v>

2212
01:41:50.931 --> 01:41:50.931
<v Speaker 4>quite pin down.</v>

2213
01:41:50.931 --> 01:41:51.030
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's the greatness as a boxer.</v>

2214
01:41:51.031 --> 01:41:52.140
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The irish people,</v>

2215
01:41:52.270 --> 01:41:57.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's also some flavor is being </v>

2216
01:41:57.270 --> 01:41:58.050
<v Speaker 4>caught and I wonder if you can ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>preempt or understand these things.</v>

2217
01:41:58.051 --> 01:42:03.051
<v Speaker 4>I wOnder if you can ever drill down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but like the sort of the work of Joseph </v>

2218
01:42:03.051 --> 01:42:03.450
<v Speaker 4>Campbell,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the work of Carl Young,</v>

2219
01:42:03.451 --> 01:42:04.620
<v Speaker 4>the worker bees people to say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2220
01:42:04.621 --> 01:42:07.590
<v Speaker 4>they are unconscious archetypes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are unconscious themes,</v>

2221
01:42:07.591 --> 01:42:10.020
<v Speaker 4>there were stories that are running </v>
<v Speaker 4>below the surface,</v>

2222
01:42:10.021 --> 01:42:13.110
<v Speaker 4>patterns,</v>
<v Speaker 4>coordInates that can be connected to.</v>

2223
01:42:13.320 --> 01:42:18.320
<v Speaker 4>Some people will not believe the </v>
<v Speaker 4>profession of in know how to harness </v>

2224
01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:22.911
<v Speaker 4>these energies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have enough people feeling not </v>

2225
01:42:22.911 --> 01:42:26.031
<v Speaker 4>good enough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they will spend money trying to feel </v>

2226
01:42:26.031 --> 01:42:29.241
<v Speaker 4>better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's the purchase of a car or a </v>

2227
01:42:29.241 --> 01:42:30.270
<v Speaker 4>coffee or whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the key ingredient is make people</v>

2228
01:42:30.271 --> 01:42:35.271
<v Speaker 4>feel not good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you can rehab and redirect people's </v>

2229
01:42:35.271 --> 01:42:38.441
<v Speaker 4>sexual eNergy so that their sexual </v>
<v Speaker 4>energy is directed at products and </v>

2230
01:42:38.441 --> 01:42:39.810
<v Speaker 4>consumerism,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then you will sell Your product.</v>

2231
01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:43.440
<v Speaker 4>But for me it seems like such a shame to</v>
<v Speaker 4>waste this force,</v>

2232
01:42:43.441 --> 01:42:48.441
<v Speaker 4>to waste this knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to waste his energy just to turn people </v>

2233
01:42:48.441 --> 01:42:52.191
<v Speaker 4>into consumers just to turn everything </v>
<v Speaker 4>on this planet into a commodity when </v>

2234
01:42:52.191 --> 01:42:55.710
<v Speaker 4>what we could be doing is using these </v>
<v Speaker 4>energy to imagine new worlds,</v>

2235
01:42:55.711 --> 01:42:58.980
<v Speaker 4>to imagine new systems,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to use our greatness,</v>

2236
01:42:59.100 --> 01:43:01.560
<v Speaker 4>to use our greatness to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

2237
01:43:01.590 --> 01:43:04.710
<v Speaker 4>Joe Love one another to create new </v>
<v Speaker 4>tribes.</v>

2238
01:43:04.770 --> 01:43:05.700
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if he.</v>

2240
01:43:06.211 --> 01:43:07.840
<v Speaker 4>you tied a lot of things together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was.</v>

2241
01:43:08.310 --> 01:43:13.310
<v Speaker 4>It was pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty good rent that coffee's really </v>

2242
01:43:13.310 --> 01:43:13.320
<v Speaker 4>kicked in and actually that's no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's serious.</v>

2243
01:43:13.321 --> 01:43:18.321
<v Speaker 4>I think I could do another one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I won't fucking handling 250 </v>

2244
01:43:18.321 --> 01:43:18.321
<v Speaker 4>milligrams.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll mainland this shit.</v>

2245
01:43:18.321 --> 01:43:21.820
<v Speaker 4>I'll pour mii you want another one?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do like it.</v>

2246
01:43:21.830 --> 01:43:26.830
<v Speaker 4>You do have a terrible drug problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is a drug.</v>

2247
01:43:27.590 --> 01:43:29.540
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what were you saying about connor's?</v>

2248
01:43:29.541 --> 01:43:32.930
<v Speaker 3>I think undeniable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a hero and he dares to be great.</v>

2249
01:43:33.050 --> 01:43:36.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean he dares to be great in a way </v>
<v Speaker 3>that very few people do and he stands in</v>

2250
01:43:36.171 --> 01:43:41.171
<v Speaker 3>front of the opponent and looks at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>entire crowd and goes and goes like that</v>

2251
01:43:41.631 --> 01:43:46.631
<v Speaker 3>and puts his hands up like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean literally is like some </v>

2252
01:43:46.631 --> 01:43:47.240
<v Speaker 3>archetypical fixture figure from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>past.</v>

2253
01:43:47.241 --> 01:43:52.241
<v Speaker 3>I mean beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean what he's also doing by doing </v>

2254
01:43:52.241 --> 01:43:52.241
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

2255
01:43:52.241 --> 01:43:55.970
<v Speaker 3>he's letting the opponent realize like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in there with greatness.</v>

2256
01:43:55.971 --> 01:43:58.490
<v Speaker 3>You're in there with someone who's </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredibly comfortable in the moment and</v>

2257
01:43:58.491 --> 01:44:02.180
<v Speaker 3>someone who truly believes that he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>great and the results that he's had,</v>

2258
01:44:02.450 --> 01:44:05.890
<v Speaker 3>like you can't deny that they have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>factor in,</v>

2259
01:44:05.891 --> 01:44:08.270
<v Speaker 3>in his future success and in the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>people love them,</v>

2260
01:44:08.271 --> 01:44:13.271
<v Speaker 3>the way knocked out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although with one punch to win the </v>

2261
01:44:13.271 --> 01:44:14.300
<v Speaker 3>title,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean this giant buildup over this long</v>

2262
01:44:14.300 --> 01:44:17.270
<v Speaker 3>period of time and then he just fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>starches them with one shot,</v>

2263
01:44:17.300 --> 01:44:20.420
<v Speaker 3>13 seconds of the fight and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>deafening roar.</v>

2264
01:44:20.421 --> 01:44:25.421
<v Speaker 3>The irish in that arena,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when that happened was it was fucking </v>

2265
01:44:25.421 --> 01:44:25.421
<v Speaker 3>insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like a hero,</v>

2266
01:44:25.421 --> 01:44:26.300
<v Speaker 3>like a mythical creature.</v>

2267
01:44:26.710 --> 01:44:31.710
<v Speaker 2>I suppose the role of the hero is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>embody and represent some inspire to </v>

2268
01:44:32.910 --> 01:44:35.370
<v Speaker 2>inspire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inspire the crowd to put me right.</v>

2269
01:44:35.860 --> 01:44:37.690
<v Speaker 3>Those people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those 15,000</v>

2270
01:44:37.720 --> 01:44:42.720
<v Speaker 3>plus people that saw that fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows how much energy that gave them</v>

2271
01:44:43.510 --> 01:44:47.350
<v Speaker 3>to then go forth and pursue their own </v>
<v Speaker 3>dreams because that's a big part of what</v>

2272
01:44:47.351 --> 01:44:52.351
<v Speaker 3>heroes represent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What a what a big part of someone who's </v>

2273
01:44:52.351 --> 01:44:55.800
<v Speaker 3>accomplishing anything spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not just that people get to watch </v>

2274
01:44:55.800 --> 01:44:57.040
<v Speaker 3>it and get this thrill of watching this </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience,</v>

2275
01:44:57.340 --> 01:45:00.760
<v Speaker 3>but also that you get energized to go </v>
<v Speaker 3>and pursue your own ideas.</v>

2276
01:45:00.761 --> 01:45:00.870
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2277
01:45:01.060 --> 01:45:01.890
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is true.</v>

2278
01:45:01.891 --> 01:45:02.940
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2279
01:45:02.941 --> 01:45:07.941
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think an integral component of the </v>

2280
01:45:07.941 --> 01:45:09.960
<v Speaker 2>mythic figure of the hero is sacrificing</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking credit.</v>

2281
01:45:10.180 --> 01:45:15.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm in the bloody world judge conor </v>
<v Speaker 2>mcgregor and any stage from any angle </v>

2282
01:45:15.180 --> 01:45:15.180
<v Speaker 2>because people that are brave enough to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do that,</v>

2283
01:45:15.180 --> 01:45:17.360
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like the,</v>

2284
01:45:17.820 --> 01:45:22.820
<v Speaker 2>what I've felt it while it resonates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've asked when somebody is willing to </v>

2285
01:45:22.820 --> 01:45:26.601
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice themselves is because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>temporarily makes us recognize when </v>

2286
01:45:26.601 --> 01:45:28.230
<v Speaker 2>someone's willing to die for what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in.</v>

2287
01:45:28.231 --> 01:45:29.100
<v Speaker 2>Whether that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2288
01:45:29.101 --> 01:45:34.101
<v Speaker 2>these civil rights leaders and miserable</v>
<v Speaker 2>for malcolm x knew he was going to die </v>

2289
01:45:34.101 --> 01:45:35.790
<v Speaker 2>for doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he did it anyway.</v>

2290
01:45:35.970 --> 01:45:38.430
<v Speaker 2>Gandy had a good sense that he was going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to die.</v>

2291
01:45:38.610 --> 01:45:43.020
<v Speaker 2>He did it anyway because what he </v>
<v Speaker 2>believed in was more important than what</v>

2292
01:45:43.021 --> 01:45:45.780
<v Speaker 2>he was as an individual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that when that happens,</v>

2293
01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:47.220
<v Speaker 2>it reminds us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2294
01:45:47.221 --> 01:45:49.050
<v Speaker 2>there's something like you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inspire.</v>

2295
01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:54.200
<v Speaker 2>It puts breath into us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It reminds us we have the capacity for </v>

2296
01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:55.320
<v Speaker 2>greatness and we are not just contained </v>
<v Speaker 2>by our body.</v>

2297
01:45:55.500 --> 01:45:58.500
<v Speaker 2>We all these streams of energy in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment,</v>

2298
01:45:58.501 --> 01:46:01.410
<v Speaker 2>perhaps there is no disconnection </v>
<v Speaker 2>between conor mcgregor in that crowd.</v>

2299
01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:06.090
<v Speaker 2>There is a oneness of purpose in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>single punch punching for all of them in</v>

2300
01:46:06.091 --> 01:46:11.091
<v Speaker 2>that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that saddens me is that </v>

2301
01:46:11.091 --> 01:46:13.360
<v Speaker 2>is ultimately not ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at least seemingly housed by an </v>

2302
01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:17.780
<v Speaker 2>economic idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the old thing that prisons are </v>

2303
01:46:17.780 --> 01:46:17.780
<v Speaker 2>the sort of contains it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?</v>

2304
01:46:18.220 --> 01:46:20.610
<v Speaker 2>You got to pay money to go there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ultimately,</v>

2305
01:46:20.611 --> 01:46:25.611
<v Speaker 2>it's a commodified thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conor mcgregor is a commodity that all </v>

2306
01:46:25.611 --> 01:46:27.090
<v Speaker 2>that makes people aware of the stakes </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are at hand,</v>

2307
01:46:27.091 --> 01:46:29.250
<v Speaker 2>that makes people aware of the magnitude</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the event.</v>

2308
01:46:29.430 --> 01:46:32.550
<v Speaker 2>If you can get pack 22,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people into an arena like that,</v>

2309
01:46:32.551 --> 01:46:34.650
<v Speaker 2>it makes people aware of the magnitude </v>
<v Speaker 2>of it all.</v>

2310
01:46:34.860 --> 01:46:37.290
<v Speaker 2>If it just happens on a soccer field,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one's watching.</v>

2311
01:46:37.560 --> 01:46:38.490
<v Speaker 2>It's not the same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2312
01:46:38.491 --> 01:46:43.491
<v Speaker 2>you're quite right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not criticizing the crowd because </v>

2313
01:46:43.491 --> 01:46:44.460
<v Speaker 2>they're or because the crowd is </v>
<v Speaker 2>important and that's what it's doing.</v>

2314
01:46:44.461 --> 01:46:49.461
<v Speaker 2>It's representing something bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like it's a shame and I feel </v>

2315
01:46:49.461 --> 01:46:54.100
<v Speaker 2>I say when you take it like we've taken </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the arts because there's more </v>

2316
01:46:54.100 --> 01:46:56.691
<v Speaker 2>sensitivity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's more cerebral and it's less </v>

2317
01:46:56.691 --> 01:46:57.210
<v Speaker 2>embodied,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so ca qubein.</v>

2318
01:46:57.300 --> 01:46:58.350
<v Speaker 2>He's like someone like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2319
01:46:58.351 --> 01:47:00.660
<v Speaker 2>like someone in the matrix waking up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their pod.</v>

2320
01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:03.290
<v Speaker 2>He woke up in the pot of fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2321
01:47:03.300 --> 01:47:08.300
<v Speaker 2>he knew he was a genius.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knew that he was connecting with </v>

2322
01:47:08.300 --> 01:47:11.661
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He knew it was representing something </v>

2323
01:47:11.661 --> 01:47:12.790
<v Speaker 2>and we also use mentally ill and a drug </v>
<v Speaker 2>addict and he killed himself and it.</v>

2324
01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:17.800
<v Speaker 2>But I think that there is a sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>comparison there that he knew that he </v>

2325
01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:17.940
<v Speaker 2>was becoming commodified.</v>

2326
01:47:17.940 --> 01:47:22.050
<v Speaker 2>He was being reduced to a commodity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He woke up in the pod and for our fuck,</v>

2327
01:47:22.350 --> 01:47:24.660
<v Speaker 2>all of these things that are coming from</v>
<v Speaker 2>my heart,</v>

2328
01:47:24.661 --> 01:47:26.400
<v Speaker 2>this truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I isolation,</v>

2329
01:47:26.401 --> 01:47:31.401
<v Speaker 2>alienation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the kinds of things that he was singing </v>

2330
01:47:31.401 --> 01:47:31.401
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in itself became a product.</v>

2331
01:47:31.401 --> 01:47:35.660
<v Speaker 2>The machine can handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The machine can take people talking </v>

2332
01:47:35.660 --> 01:47:38.991
<v Speaker 2>about that connecting to people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>deepest fears of India that inadequacy </v>

2333
01:47:38.991 --> 01:47:41.640
<v Speaker 2>and worthlessness and it can turn that </v>
<v Speaker 2>into a product and sell it to them.</v>

2334
01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:46.760
<v Speaker 2>I think you're getting caught up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>money as always being a negative anD I </v>

2335
01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:50.931
<v Speaker 2>think connor is actually eMbrace The </v>
<v Speaker 2>money as a part of the narrative and I </v>

2336
01:47:50.931 --> 01:47:55.371
<v Speaker 2>think you know another person who's done</v>
<v Speaker 2>that without bragging about that as </v>

2337
01:47:55.371 --> 01:47:58.371
<v Speaker 2>manny pacquiao,</v>
<v Speaker 2>manny pacquiao was made hundreds of </v>

2338
01:47:58.371 --> 01:48:02.090
<v Speaker 2>millions of dollars in the same form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has actually used that to spread well </v>

2339
01:48:02.090 --> 01:48:05.040
<v Speaker 2>throughout the Philippines and hands out</v>
<v Speaker 2>money to people and he's famously.</v>

2340
01:48:05.360 --> 01:48:10.360
<v Speaker 2>I'm generous in that regard and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>with connor's done is it's part of his </v>

2341
01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:14.841
<v Speaker 2>hero mythologies and he's sitting on a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's sitting on a throne on a pile of </v>

2342
01:48:14.841 --> 01:48:16.440
<v Speaker 2>gold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really a part of it all.</v>

2343
01:48:16.470 --> 01:48:17.850
<v Speaker 2>He's a king.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is a hero.</v>

2344
01:48:17.851 --> 01:48:20.610
<v Speaker 2>Now the heart of the story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not criticizing him as an individual</v>

2345
01:48:20.611 --> 01:48:22.840
<v Speaker 2>and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>conor mcgregor the money.</v>

2346
01:48:22.860 --> 01:48:24.410
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm criticizing the seed.</v>

2347
01:48:24.470 --> 01:48:29.470
<v Speaker 2>Money is a part of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not necessarily negative and I </v>

2348
01:48:29.470 --> 01:48:32.520
<v Speaker 2>don't think it is negative at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but joe money is literally a symbol.</v>

2349
01:48:32.550 --> 01:48:34.920
<v Speaker 2>It is nothing but that represent </v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

2350
01:48:34.950 --> 01:48:39.950
<v Speaker 2>I promised to pay the bearer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>we believe this is one up in semantics </v>

2351
01:48:39.950 --> 01:48:41.850
<v Speaker 2>because he could definitely go out and </v>
<v Speaker 2>buy a house with that.</v>

2352
01:48:41.851 --> 01:48:46.851
<v Speaker 2>Money is real as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he can go out and buy mansions and </v>

2353
01:48:46.851 --> 01:48:48.180
<v Speaker 2>cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's real as fuck.</v>

2354
01:48:48.330 --> 01:48:52.050
<v Speaker 2>The idea that it represents like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I promise to give you this.</v>

2355
01:48:52.051 --> 01:48:53.190
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a promissory note,</v>

2356
01:48:53.191 --> 01:48:54.840
<v Speaker 2>but it's fucking real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2357
01:48:54.841 --> 01:48:57.750
<v Speaker 2>he has all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has 100 million dollars.</v>

2358
01:48:57.870 --> 01:49:02.870
<v Speaker 2>It is a part of the store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is sitting on a throne on a pile of </v>

2359
01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:03.570
<v Speaker 2>gold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He does have a crown,</v>

2360
01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:06.990
<v Speaker 2>is a crown on his fucking neck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's real.</v>

2361
01:49:08.300 --> 01:49:13.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I don't see conor mcgregor is the </v>

2362
01:49:13.300 --> 01:49:14.260
<v Speaker 2>terminus of this point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

2363
01:49:14.430 --> 01:49:19.430
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is an opportunity to critique what </v>

2364
01:49:19.430 --> 01:49:22.950
<v Speaker 2>the culture is telling us and what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture is doing to us.</v>

2365
01:49:22.951 --> 01:49:23.750
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2366
01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:25.110
<v Speaker 2>I understand that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2367
01:49:25.111 --> 01:49:28.410
<v Speaker 2>with money you can acquire goods and </v>
<v Speaker 2>services,</v>

2368
01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:33.240
<v Speaker 2>but what I'm saying is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that our system for evaluate in worth</v>

2369
01:49:33.270 --> 01:49:38.270
<v Speaker 2>has become about commodities instead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps about beauty or about love.</v>

2370
01:49:38.850 --> 01:49:39.630
<v Speaker 2>Not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2371
01:49:39.690 --> 01:49:44.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying that conor mcgregor </v>
<v Speaker 2>should give away all this money and </v>

2372
01:49:44.690 --> 01:49:44.690
<v Speaker 2>start marchIng around a be the new jesus</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Ireland.</v>

2373
01:49:44.690 --> 01:49:46.710
<v Speaker 2>Then that will be fucking fascinating to</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch unfold.</v>

2374
01:49:47.020 --> 01:49:48.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying that isn't</v>

2375
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:52.090
<v Speaker 4>it discussed question,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it not a little unfortunate,</v>

2376
01:49:52.270 --> 01:49:57.270
<v Speaker 4>but greatness is ultimately given to us </v>
<v Speaker 4>as a product that that is how it is </v>

2377
01:49:57.581 --> 01:49:59.470
<v Speaker 4>received.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how it's understood.</v>

2378
01:49:59.710 --> 01:50:04.710
<v Speaker 4>Is it possible that there will be other </v>
<v Speaker 4>ways of demonstrating greatness as he </v>

2379
01:50:04.710 --> 01:50:05.760
<v Speaker 4>does?</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know when he's fighting?</v>

2380
01:50:05.770 --> 01:50:07.750
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kurt cobain did when he was playing,</v>

2381
01:50:07.990 --> 01:50:11.560
<v Speaker 4>but ultimately the dominant thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that dominant puppet here,</v>

2382
01:50:11.561 --> 01:50:14.080
<v Speaker 4>the thing pulling the strings is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>dollar.</v>

2383
01:50:14.350 --> 01:50:15.280
<v Speaker 4>I don't tHink it is.</v>

2384
01:50:15.670 --> 01:50:18.220
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a part of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Much like you know,</v>

2385
01:50:18.221 --> 01:50:20.200
<v Speaker 3>your clothes are a part of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2386
01:50:20.201 --> 01:50:23.110
<v Speaker 3>what you look like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's the dominant thing.</v>

2387
01:50:23.380 --> 01:50:26.080
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a big part of how you sell </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2388
01:50:26.290 --> 01:50:28.150
<v Speaker 3>like this is going to be the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 3>fight ever.</v>

2389
01:50:28.151 --> 01:50:31.870
<v Speaker 3>He's going to make x million dollars and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way condamine,</v>

2390
01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:34.090
<v Speaker 3>but connor uses that as a part of his </v>
<v Speaker 3>narrative.</v>

2391
01:50:34.130 --> 01:50:37.210
<v Speaker 3>He drives around in a drop top bentley </v>
<v Speaker 3>and he's,</v>

2392
01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:39.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got beautiful watches and suits and</v>

2393
01:50:39.971 --> 01:50:41.650
<v Speaker 3>say fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and pin striping.</v>

2394
01:50:41.651 --> 01:50:46.651
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's part of what he's done by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>By creating this incredible mythology </v>

2395
01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:53.760
<v Speaker 3>mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's necessarily in any </v>

2396
01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:53.760
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shape or form negative.</v>

2397
01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:53.760
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a part of the story.</v>

2398
01:50:53.760 --> 01:50:54.990
<v Speaker 4>Say with hip hop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2399
01:50:54.991 --> 01:50:59.991
<v Speaker 4>This is possibly a similar way of </v>
<v Speaker 4>looking at the same idea and this isn't </v>

2400
01:50:59.991 --> 01:50:59.991
<v Speaker 4>saying I know the answer to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what I mean?</v>

2401
01:50:59.991 --> 01:51:00.020
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not.</v>

2402
01:51:00.021 --> 01:51:03.420
<v Speaker 4>The kind of work is being out and I want</v>
<v Speaker 4>to teach you there.</v>

2403
01:51:03.480 --> 01:51:05.700
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to fucking work out myself.</v>

2404
01:51:05.880 --> 01:51:07.220
<v Speaker 4>Say with hip hop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hip hop first.</v>

2405
01:51:07.230 --> 01:51:09.930
<v Speaker 4>When it comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it comes out as this angry raw.</v>

2406
01:51:10.050 --> 01:51:11.220
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not really pay.</v>

2407
01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:13.310
<v Speaker 3>Originally it came out as like a happy </v>
<v Speaker 3>ron,</v>

2408
01:51:13.450 --> 01:51:16.800
<v Speaker 3>a hip hop hibbett to the hippity hip hop</v>
<v Speaker 3>activity beat.</v>

2409
01:51:16.801 --> 01:51:18.610
<v Speaker 3>Don't stop this bit with</v>

2410
01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:22.850
<v Speaker 4>for combat or at the beginning and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>like it becomes a social whole.</v>

2411
01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:23.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

2412
01:51:23.750 --> 01:51:27.140
<v Speaker 4>Heal and bambara and yesterday early hip</v>
<v Speaker 4>hop pioneers and then we go through this</v>

2413
01:51:27.141 --> 01:51:28.640
<v Speaker 4>sort of that phase of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2414
01:51:28.641 --> 01:51:30.350
<v Speaker 4>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It goes through the early part of it.</v>

2415
01:51:30.380 --> 01:51:30.910
<v Speaker 4>Jolly</v>

2416
01:51:31.900 --> 01:51:34.230
<v Speaker 3>alliance to rap,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gangster rap,</v>

2417
01:51:36.260 --> 01:51:39.930
<v Speaker 3>like anger of we are going to have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>voice straight outta compton.</v>

2418
01:51:40.020 --> 01:51:45.020
<v Speaker 4>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then that in itself becomes about </v>

2419
01:51:45.020 --> 01:51:48.220
<v Speaker 4>like what is the subsequent mutations of</v>
<v Speaker 4>hip hop as it becomes sort of claimed by</v>

2420
01:51:48.221 --> 01:51:51.030
<v Speaker 4>a dominant system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It becomes about jewelry,</v>

2421
01:51:51.300 --> 01:51:54.450
<v Speaker 4>bling,</v>
<v Speaker 4>particular attitudes and lou,</v>

2422
01:51:54.510 --> 01:51:57.630
<v Speaker 4>do you not see what I'm saying that </v>
<v Speaker 4>there's sort of almost like a trend.</v>

2423
01:51:57.660 --> 01:52:02.160
<v Speaker 4>Things get pulled into a certain strand,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a certain way of being.</v>

2424
01:52:02.170 --> 01:52:02.410
<v Speaker 4>It</v>

2425
01:52:02.410 --> 01:52:03.970
<v Speaker 3>does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't have to look.</v>

2426
01:52:03.971 --> 01:52:07.330
<v Speaker 3>It didn't with some guys like the really</v>
<v Speaker 3>like here's a perfect example,</v>

2427
01:52:07.331 --> 01:52:09.250
<v Speaker 3>one of the best rappers ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nas,</v>

2428
01:52:09.670 --> 01:52:13.450
<v Speaker 3>nas never fell into that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nas remains one of the best lyricists of</v>

2429
01:52:13.451 --> 01:52:17.770
<v Speaker 3>all time remains brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of his rap has meaning.</v>

2430
01:52:17.771 --> 01:52:19.990
<v Speaker 3>It's creative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting.</v>

2431
01:52:20.380 --> 01:52:22.900
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't fall into all the bullshit </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the bling,</v>

2432
01:52:22.901 --> 01:52:26.200
<v Speaker 3>although he has plenty of money and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>has all the trappings.</v>

2433
01:52:26.410 --> 01:52:31.410
<v Speaker 3>He's got this sort of style about him </v>
<v Speaker 3>where I believe his father was a jazz </v>

2434
01:52:31.751 --> 01:52:34.480
<v Speaker 3>musician and he grew up with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2435
01:52:34.481 --> 01:52:38.290
<v Speaker 3>with art in his family and he's an </v>
<v Speaker 3>artist first and foremost,</v>

2436
01:52:38.291 --> 01:52:41.350
<v Speaker 3>and although he's a brilliant rapper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's my favorite rapper.</v>

2437
01:52:41.710 --> 01:52:46.250
<v Speaker 3>I think that he's never really fallen </v>
<v Speaker 3>into all the bullshit blang,</v>

2438
01:52:46.250 --> 01:52:47.660
<v Speaker 2>mansions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>

2439
01:52:47.661 --> 01:52:52.661
<v Speaker 2>Like the display of it all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he has these things but it's not </v>

2440
01:52:52.661 --> 01:52:55.760
<v Speaker 2>the primary display when you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about nas,</v>

2441
01:52:55.761 --> 01:52:58.970
<v Speaker 2>like as an artist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a musician and because again,</v>

2442
01:52:58.971 --> 01:53:03.971
<v Speaker 2>like I suppose what I'm interested in is</v>
<v Speaker 2>how like sort of cultural movements </v>

2443
01:53:03.971 --> 01:53:08.710
<v Speaker 2>start off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems by saying something that's </v>

2444
01:53:08.710 --> 01:53:11.771
<v Speaker 2>important and powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's punk or hip hop like </v>

2445
01:53:11.771 --> 01:53:14.441
<v Speaker 2>becomes a voice to the disembodied or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>way of conveying a embodied </v>

2446
01:53:14.441 --> 01:53:18.500
<v Speaker 2>disenfranchised comes a voice for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or like in a similar thing with punk </v>

2447
01:53:18.500 --> 01:53:22.331
<v Speaker 2>punk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very observable because it was </v>

2448
01:53:22.331 --> 01:53:23.120
<v Speaker 2>relatively short term movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The bands like the pistols and the clash</v>

2449
01:53:23.121 --> 01:53:28.121
<v Speaker 2>and all these stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these bands come out of england and it </v>

2450
01:53:28.121 --> 01:53:28.880
<v Speaker 2>quickly became sort of commodified and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sold back to people.</v>

2451
01:53:28.881 --> 01:53:31.740
<v Speaker 2>What I'm saying is is like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this could be resolved,</v>

2452
01:53:31.750 --> 01:53:36.750
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm now during the second candidate </v>

2453
01:53:36.750 --> 01:53:36.750
<v Speaker 2>caveman coffee in his skin deep.</v>

2454
01:53:36.750 --> 01:53:38.630
<v Speaker 2>the pimps in my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is too much for one man.</v>

2455
01:53:38.631 --> 01:53:41.370
<v Speaker 2>I think it's 5:40</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the two kiDs as well.</v>

2456
01:53:41.470 --> 01:53:43.220
<v Speaker 2>Do the dMT now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm almost there.</v>

2457
01:53:43.370 --> 01:53:45.000
<v Speaker 2>So like um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm saying is,</v>

2458
01:53:45.001 --> 01:53:48.980
<v Speaker 2>is that things start with this original </v>
<v Speaker 2>germ greatness,</v>

2459
01:53:49.300 --> 01:53:54.300
<v Speaker 2>a glory heroism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's anger and there's an </v>

2460
01:53:54.300 --> 01:53:56.750
<v Speaker 2>external system though joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can turn into a product and sell it</v>

2461
01:53:56.751 --> 01:54:01.751
<v Speaker 2>to people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that does strip it of </v>

2462
01:54:01.751 --> 01:54:03.620
<v Speaker 2>its,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of its real value and you all saying,</v>

2463
01:54:03.621 --> 01:54:04.820
<v Speaker 2>I suppose no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter.</v>

2464
01:54:04.821 --> 01:54:09.821
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That can just be the architecture of it </v>

2465
01:54:09.821 --> 01:54:09.821
<v Speaker 2>or the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the aspects of it.</v>

2466
01:54:09.821 --> 01:54:14.160
<v Speaker 2>And I'm just saying as long as we have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>system that is ultimately about making </v>

2467
01:54:14.181 --> 01:54:16.400
<v Speaker 2>money and turning everything into </v>
<v Speaker 2>profit.</v>

2468
01:54:16.401 --> 01:54:18.580
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I'm not saying this </v>
<v Speaker 2>about any of the individualized.</v>

2469
01:54:18.590 --> 01:54:19.700
<v Speaker 2>In fact that's the point I'm making.</v>

2470
01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:23.620
<v Speaker 2>He is great now as this great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>

2471
01:54:23.630 --> 01:54:24.020
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>

2472
01:54:24.021 --> 01:54:24.410
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

2473
01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:27.410
<v Speaker 2>But ultimately you great me great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're like,</v>

2474
01:54:27.440 --> 01:54:32.440
<v Speaker 2>please god like a pool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But everyone's pulled in the direction </v>

2475
01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:33.990
<v Speaker 2>of prophets of like is a thing you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>got to swIm for.</v>

2476
01:54:34.010 --> 01:54:39.010
<v Speaker 2>Like now as we become free,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there something different that could </v>

2477
01:54:39.010 --> 01:54:39.050
<v Speaker 2>be done here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can something truly glorious?</v>

2478
01:54:39.051 --> 01:54:44.051
<v Speaker 2>Be down here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you describe that moment of </v>

2479
01:54:44.051 --> 01:54:45.680
<v Speaker 2>vegas temporarily being overwhelmed </v>
<v Speaker 2>noise.</v>

2480
01:54:45.681 --> 01:54:48.410
<v Speaker 2>It has been in recent days by tragedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>death and blood,</v>

2481
01:54:48.500 --> 01:54:53.500
<v Speaker 2>but it a glorious spirit of Ireland and </v>
<v Speaker 2>a hero that isn't the unfortunate that </v>

2482
01:54:54.591 --> 01:54:59.591
<v Speaker 2>that energy can't be literally used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>create better worlds,</v>

2483
01:55:00.380 --> 01:55:03.110
<v Speaker 2>better systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>better lives or that really happens is a</v>

2484
01:55:03.111 --> 01:55:05.630
<v Speaker 2>load of people make bunch of money and </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>

2485
01:55:05.631 --> 01:55:08.690
<v Speaker 2>And I don't necessarily mean the fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>protagonists,</v>

2486
01:55:08.750 --> 01:55:13.750
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like people talk a lot about our </v>

2487
01:55:13.750 --> 01:55:13.750
<v Speaker 2>athletes and too much money I don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>agree with.</v>

2488
01:55:13.750 --> 01:55:15.920
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the few ways that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>ordinary working class people can make a</v>

2489
01:55:15.921 --> 01:55:20.921
<v Speaker 2>lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there are people at the top of that </v>

2490
01:55:20.921 --> 01:55:21.050
<v Speaker 2>chain is siphoning significant amount of</v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

2491
01:55:21.051 --> 01:55:23.270
<v Speaker 2>I've all of those little industries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2492
01:55:23.271 --> 01:55:24.090
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's my question.</v>

2493
01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:26.510
<v Speaker 2>Responsible for making it happen in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first place.</v>

2494
01:55:26.511 --> 01:55:31.511
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can't leave It up to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>athletes to put something like that </v>

2495
01:55:31.511 --> 01:55:31.511
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need a dana,</v>

2496
01:55:31.511 --> 01:55:31.970
<v Speaker 2>why you need a floyd mayweather and </v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

2497
01:55:32.030 --> 01:55:34.760
<v Speaker 2>The money team productions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need people to promote it.</v>

2498
01:55:34.761 --> 01:55:39.761
<v Speaker 2>You need people to put together a press </v>
<v Speaker 2>junket and a world tour and then you </v>

2499
01:55:39.761 --> 01:55:41.250
<v Speaker 2>need people to organize the paper view </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then ben.</v>

2500
01:55:41.270 --> 01:55:44.070
<v Speaker 2>Then the real ultimate result is the</v>

2501
01:55:44.070 --> 01:55:48.150
<v Speaker 3>inspiration that all the people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>watch it get the inspiration,</v>

2502
01:55:48.151 --> 01:55:51.480
<v Speaker 3>the entertainment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's completely up to the individual</v>

2503
01:55:51.481 --> 01:55:56.481
<v Speaker 3>whether or not they pursue greatness or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whether they just pursue money and it's </v>

2504
01:55:56.481 --> 01:56:00.951
<v Speaker 3>a trap if there's trappings in both ways</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the trappings of greatness with no </v>

2505
01:56:00.951 --> 01:56:05.751
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's the sadness of someone who dies </v>

2506
01:56:05.751 --> 01:56:05.751
<v Speaker 3>great,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but penniless and homeless.</v>

2507
01:56:05.751 --> 01:56:10.220
<v Speaker 3>and then there's the guy who just threw </v>
<v Speaker 3>it all away from money and that never </v>

2508
01:56:10.220 --> 01:56:11.760
<v Speaker 3>ever realized its full potential.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is equally sad.</v>

2509
01:56:11.790 --> 01:56:16.790
<v Speaker 3>But I think the in that is that we are </v>
<v Speaker 3>showing a particular aspect of our own </v>

2510
01:56:17.701 --> 01:56:21.180
<v Speaker 3>conditioning there in believing in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>myth of the individual,</v>

2511
01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:24.150
<v Speaker 3>but the Individual will always try and </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have greatness,</v>

2512
01:56:24.151 --> 01:56:29.151
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like now you did say like the great </v>

2513
01:56:29.151 --> 01:56:30.950
<v Speaker 3>person that dies penniless know it's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of a shame that we don't create </v>

2514
01:56:30.950 --> 01:56:34.770
<v Speaker 3>benevolent systems that are helpful to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the vulnerable.</v>

2515
01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:36.780
<v Speaker 3>Wherever you're talking about sport,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2516
01:56:36.790 --> 01:56:39.530
<v Speaker 3>If you're talking about is completely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2517
01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:44.600
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there has to be some sort of a support </v>

2518
01:56:44.600 --> 01:56:46.431
<v Speaker 3>team behind the individual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's deplete completely dependent </v>

2519
01:56:46.431 --> 01:56:47.170
<v Speaker 3>upon the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't have john cavanagh,</v>

2520
01:56:47.400 --> 01:56:51.460
<v Speaker 3>you don't have a straight blast gym,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have ido portal and then dylan</v>

2521
01:56:51.461 --> 01:56:53.550
<v Speaker 3>dannis and all the different people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>train connor.</v>

2522
01:56:53.551 --> 01:56:56.580
<v Speaker 3>You don't have connor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you have all those things,</v>

2523
01:56:56.581 --> 01:57:01.290
<v Speaker 3>it's entirely dependent upon the one </v>
<v Speaker 3>individual that takes that knowledge and</v>

2524
01:57:01.291 --> 01:57:06.291
<v Speaker 3>goes in there and performs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's so scary about It and </v>

2525
01:57:06.291 --> 01:57:09.231
<v Speaker 3>that's what's so rewarding to people </v>
<v Speaker 3>that watch it because they know it's so </v>

2526
01:57:09.231 --> 01:57:09.720
<v Speaker 3>dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so crazy.</v>

2527
01:57:09.721 --> 01:57:14.721
<v Speaker 3>It's so fraught with peril to be the one</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's so much lies upon the the one </v>

2528
01:57:16.020 --> 01:57:21.020
<v Speaker 3>that the weight on his shoulders is </v>
<v Speaker 3>massive and that's one of the most </v>

2529
01:57:21.020 --> 01:57:24.171
<v Speaker 3>substantial things and the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>impressive things about connor is the </v>

2530
01:57:24.171 --> 01:57:27.801
<v Speaker 3>way it handles the weight of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>pressure that it goes in there and does </v>

2531
01:57:27.801 --> 01:57:32.361
<v Speaker 3>this in in the giant big moment that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>stands there in front of everybody and </v>

2532
01:57:32.361 --> 01:57:36.300
<v Speaker 3>throws his arms out like he's the king </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then everybody goes fucking crazy.</v>

2533
01:57:36.330 --> 01:57:37.730
<v Speaker 3>That he's glorious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2534
01:57:37.780 --> 01:57:40.890
<v Speaker 3>It's nothing to do with money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it does,</v>

2535
01:57:40.891 --> 01:57:43.200
<v Speaker 3>but money is a part of it all its </v>
<v Speaker 3>greatness.</v>

2536
01:57:43.440 --> 01:57:47.550
<v Speaker 3>Greatness is the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The money is a side effect of greatness.</v>

2537
01:57:47.551 --> 01:57:51.150
<v Speaker 3>That shit when he does that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't mean come on man.</v>

2538
01:57:51.210 --> 01:57:56.210
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful case that because I don't ever</v>
<v Speaker 3>want conor mcgregor to listen to this </v>

2539
01:57:56.210 --> 01:58:00.740
<v Speaker 3>and things like brian's criticized.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We didn't make like fucking shoulders on</v>

2540
01:58:02.461 --> 01:58:04.590
<v Speaker 3>that son of a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially that left.</v>

2541
01:58:04.591 --> 01:58:08.880
<v Speaker 3>No wonder why knocked people dead easy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to tell from the angle,</v>

2542
01:58:08.881 --> 01:58:11.590
<v Speaker 3>but big fucks people up at that left </v>
<v Speaker 3>hand.</v>

2543
01:58:11.640 --> 01:58:16.640
<v Speaker 3>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not a critique of any </v>

2544
01:58:16.640 --> 01:58:17.220
<v Speaker 3>individual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is my.</v>

2545
01:58:17.610 --> 01:58:22.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm trying to understand how systems </v>
<v Speaker 3>work and that's why I'm trying to </v>

2546
01:58:22.610 --> 01:58:25.881
<v Speaker 3>understand and I'm suggesting that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're all favorite ways of doing </v>

2547
01:58:25.881 --> 01:58:27.030
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even they let me say this,</v>

2548
01:58:27.060 --> 01:58:28.950
<v Speaker 3>this system doesn't mean jack shit.</v>

2549
01:58:28.950 --> 01:58:32.100
<v Speaker 3>If someone can't rise,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy is dIfferent.</v>

2550
01:58:32.280 --> 01:58:34.500
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the system exists all day long,</v>

2551
01:58:34.501 --> 01:58:36.090
<v Speaker 3>24 slash seven,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three 65.</v>

2552
01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:38.190
<v Speaker 3>The systems going on this weekend in </v>
<v Speaker 3>vegas,</v>

2553
01:58:38.460 --> 01:58:40.080
<v Speaker 3>there's going to be to world title </v>
<v Speaker 3>fights.</v>

2554
01:58:40.081 --> 01:58:45.081
<v Speaker 3>It's not nearly the amount of attention </v>
<v Speaker 3>being paid to these two world title </v>

2555
01:58:45.081 --> 01:58:49.291
<v Speaker 3>fights this weekend is conor mcgregor </v>
<v Speaker 3>pulling his dick out and taking a piss </v>

2556
01:58:49.291 --> 01:58:53.971
<v Speaker 3>in a punch bowl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He could do that on paper view and more </v>

2557
01:58:53.971 --> 01:58:53.971
<v Speaker 3>people would watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

2558
01:58:53.971 --> 01:58:56.530
<v Speaker 3>Because he's done so much In the past as</v>
<v Speaker 3>an individual.</v>

2559
01:58:56.531 --> 01:58:58.900
<v Speaker 3>The greatness that he is shown,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

2560
01:58:58.930 --> 01:59:02.200
<v Speaker 3>It's more than just money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more than just the system.</v>

2561
01:59:02.201 --> 01:59:06.400
<v Speaker 3>The system exists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a matter of one person figuring out</v>

2562
01:59:06.401 --> 01:59:11.401
<v Speaker 3>the frequency that this system operates </v>
<v Speaker 3>on and showing this unbelievable </v>

2563
01:59:12.041 --> 01:59:17.041
<v Speaker 3>performance inside that system and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the individual and that </v>

2564
01:59:17.041 --> 01:59:18.070
<v Speaker 3>individual is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you talk about his past,</v>

2565
01:59:18.071 --> 01:59:18.610
<v Speaker 3>when he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2566
01:59:18.611 --> 01:59:23.611
<v Speaker 3>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was working as a construction worker </v>

2567
01:59:23.611 --> 01:59:23.611
<v Speaker 3>or as a plumber or some shit and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2568
01:59:23.611 --> 01:59:25.780
<v Speaker 3>he'd done some amateur boxing and some </v>
<v Speaker 3>mma fights.</v>

2569
01:59:25.780 --> 01:59:30.780
<v Speaker 3>He was a regular guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He grew up in a working class </v>

2570
01:59:30.780 --> 01:59:30.780
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't rich.</v>

2571
01:59:30.780 --> 01:59:31.300
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing substantial about him.</v>

2572
01:59:31.390 --> 01:59:36.390
<v Speaker 3>He even his own parents say they never </v>
<v Speaker 3>thought that he was going to be this </v>

2573
01:59:36.390 --> 01:59:36.700
<v Speaker 3>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He figured out a way through it.</v>

2574
01:59:36.701 --> 01:59:39.520
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't born the king.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wasn't some,</v>

2575
01:59:39.550 --> 01:59:41.710
<v Speaker 3>some person who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

2576
01:59:41.740 --> 01:59:44.740
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason was gifted with this</v>
<v Speaker 3>existence,</v>

2577
01:59:44.940 --> 01:59:47.260
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he worked his way through it,</v>

2578
01:59:47.261 --> 01:59:50.290
<v Speaker 3>figured it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and once he got to the greatest stage in</v>

2579
01:59:50.291 --> 01:59:52.210
<v Speaker 3>the world when the pressure was at its </v>
<v Speaker 3>highest,</v>

2580
01:59:52.390 --> 01:59:54.640
<v Speaker 3>he shown like the brightest star in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe.</v>

2581
01:59:54.641 --> 01:59:56.590
<v Speaker 3>And that's What's so exciting about him.</v>

2582
01:59:56.680 --> 01:59:59.200
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's beautiful and fascinating,</v>

2583
01:59:59.500 --> 02:00:02.480
<v Speaker 2>but my question is about </v>
<v Speaker 2>commodification.</v>

2584
02:00:02.870 --> 02:00:04.000
<v Speaker 2>Money freak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're free.</v>

2585
02:00:05.730 --> 02:00:07.210
<v Speaker 2>You're not free to amend that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold them,</v>

2586
02:00:07.211 --> 02:00:10.930
<v Speaker 2>but when you say you take a look at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>empty right or take a lot,</v>

2587
02:00:10.931 --> 02:00:15.931
<v Speaker 2>I've taken a few taking it 99 times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you have them experiences,</v>

2588
02:00:17.560 --> 02:00:19.660
<v Speaker 2>what does it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you come back from it,</v>

2589
02:00:19.840 --> 02:00:24.430
<v Speaker 2>what is it that you feel about the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>that systems are organized?</v>

2590
02:00:24.431 --> 02:00:29.431
<v Speaker 2>Do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you come back from it quite </v>

2591
02:00:29.431 --> 02:00:29.431
<v Speaker 2>fatalistic?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2592
02:00:29.431 --> 02:00:29.431
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's just the way the world is.</v>

2593
02:00:29.431 --> 02:00:29.431
<v Speaker 2>Do you Think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold on a minute.</v>

2594
02:00:29.431 --> 02:00:31.690
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking mental.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's so much stuff going on.</v>

2595
02:00:31.691 --> 02:00:34.270
<v Speaker 2>Things could be different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think about the way that you</v>

2596
02:00:34.271 --> 02:00:36.130
<v Speaker 2>think about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think about these systems.</v>

2597
02:00:36.131 --> 02:00:41.131
<v Speaker 2>I think you spent a lot of time thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the elites in the one percent and </v>

2598
02:00:41.131 --> 02:00:41.131
<v Speaker 2>the systems.</v>

2599
02:00:41.131 --> 02:00:41.740
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2600
02:00:42.060 --> 02:00:43.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't think about that stuff very </v>
<v Speaker 2>much.</v>

2601
02:00:44.400 --> 02:00:49.150
<v Speaker 2>nor do I think mostly about why I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>interested in is god and oneness.</v>

2602
02:00:49.210 --> 02:00:53.290
<v Speaker 2>And I think that greatness is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation of god.</v>

2603
02:00:53.291 --> 02:00:58.291
<v Speaker 2>I think that is coming through conor </v>
<v Speaker 2>mcgregor or kurt cobain or jimi hendrix </v>

2604
02:00:58.291 --> 02:01:02.401
<v Speaker 2>or Dorothy Parker is some kind of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beauty that that person is the perfect </v>

2605
02:01:02.711 --> 02:01:07.711
<v Speaker 2>vessel for iconography is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>realization of greatness or the </v>

2606
02:01:07.711 --> 02:01:11.180
<v Speaker 2>realization of god in inverted commerce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Given them this is the singing,</v>

2607
02:01:11.200 --> 02:01:13.810
<v Speaker 2>the stO playing the star spangled banner</v>
<v Speaker 2>at woodstock.</v>

2608
02:01:13.900 --> 02:01:15.430
<v Speaker 2>unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here is some,</v>

2609
02:01:15.790 --> 02:01:19.540
<v Speaker 2>some moment that pulls us all together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now what my curiosity is about the empty</v>

2610
02:01:19.720 --> 02:01:24.720
<v Speaker 2>is that does dmt make you experience </v>
<v Speaker 2>that oneness or that loss of self in a </v>

2611
02:01:24.720 --> 02:01:26.890
<v Speaker 2>way that's kind of religious or </v>
<v Speaker 2>spiritual?</v>

2612
02:01:26.891 --> 02:01:29.380
<v Speaker 2>What does it do to your tense loss of </v>
<v Speaker 2>self?</v>

2613
02:01:29.430 --> 02:01:33.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean as intense as any thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's.</v>

2614
02:01:33.051 --> 02:01:33.210
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

2615
02:01:33.310 --> 02:01:38.310
<v Speaker 3>not even.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't say as there's no </v>

2616
02:01:38.310 --> 02:01:40.851
<v Speaker 3>comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't say as intense as anything </v>

2617
02:01:40.851 --> 02:01:40.851
<v Speaker 3>because there's not a word</v>

2618
02:01:40.851 --> 02:01:42.020
<v Speaker 2>that I could say that's going to come </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of my mouth.</v>

2619
02:01:42.021 --> 02:01:44.360
<v Speaker 2>It's going to do it justice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The words haven't been invented.</v>

2620
02:01:44.361 --> 02:01:48.290
<v Speaker 2>They don't exist because it does all </v>
<v Speaker 2>words that we have created.</v>

2621
02:01:48.291 --> 02:01:51.320
<v Speaker 2>They represent things that we can </v>
<v Speaker 2>reference in the material world.</v>

2622
02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:53.870
<v Speaker 2>When you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you have a dmt experience,</v>

2623
02:01:53.871 --> 02:01:55.940
<v Speaker 2>you're literally having a conversation </v>
<v Speaker 2>with god.</v>

2624
02:01:55.941 --> 02:02:00.941
<v Speaker 2>You're experiencing something that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything and something that's </v>

2625
02:02:00.941 --> 02:02:02.900
<v Speaker 2>infinitely powerful infinitely wise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way I've described it,</v>

2626
02:02:02.901 --> 02:02:07.901
<v Speaker 2>as you're seeing this insane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>infinite world of complex geometric </v>

2627
02:02:09.711 --> 02:02:11.780
<v Speaker 2>patterns that are made out of love and </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding,</v>

2628
02:02:12.040 --> 02:02:13.070
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2629
02:02:13.140 --> 02:02:17.010
<v Speaker 2>But there's things in there that might </v>
<v Speaker 2>have these entities.</v>

2630
02:02:17.030 --> 02:02:22.030
<v Speaker 2>He feels something in there that knows </v>
<v Speaker 2>you and I don't know if it's you that </v>

2631
02:02:22.030 --> 02:02:26.891
<v Speaker 2>knows you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you that gets your bullshit </v>

2632
02:02:26.891 --> 02:02:27.500
<v Speaker 2>separations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dissolve is my,</v>

2633
02:02:27.530 --> 02:02:32.530
<v Speaker 2>is my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My suspicion is that there is no </v>

2634
02:02:32.530 --> 02:02:32.530
<v Speaker 2>separate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no subject object.</v>

2635
02:02:32.530 --> 02:02:34.040
<v Speaker 2>There is only oneness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you yourself just said,</v>

2636
02:02:34.041 --> 02:02:37.490
<v Speaker 2>it's about starts to feel like it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>about loving and one show.</v>

2637
02:02:37.910 --> 02:02:42.910
<v Speaker 2>So that level of consciousness exists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So my belief is that our systems we </v>

2638
02:02:42.991 --> 02:02:47.991
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our athletic systems are in attainment </v>

2639
02:02:47.991 --> 02:02:50.051
<v Speaker 2>systems and certainly our economic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>political and social systems should be </v>

2640
02:02:50.051 --> 02:02:53.261
<v Speaker 2>as close to as possible to that feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that feeling should be our guiding </v>

2641
02:02:54.741 --> 02:02:57.620
<v Speaker 2>light.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not criticizing conor mcgregor,</v>

2642
02:02:57.621 --> 02:03:01.520
<v Speaker 2>the great genius who like I'm fascinated</v>
<v Speaker 2>by and door all kumbaya know anyone.</v>

2643
02:03:01.580 --> 02:03:06.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it odd that you have personally </v>

2644
02:03:06.580 --> 02:03:08.660
<v Speaker 2>experienced in your way through dmt and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I have free yoga and meditation and she,</v>

2645
02:03:08.740 --> 02:03:09.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was a kid,</v>

2646
02:03:09.860 --> 02:03:14.860
<v Speaker 2>they sense of oneness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this love that seems to transcend my </v>

2647
02:03:14.860 --> 02:03:18.041
<v Speaker 2>personal form and everything I believe </v>
<v Speaker 2>in and yet when it comes to our systems </v>

2648
02:03:18.041 --> 02:03:18.380
<v Speaker 2>for organizing this plane that we live </v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

2649
02:03:18.381 --> 02:03:23.381
<v Speaker 2>the material plane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the choices we make are not about that </v>

2650
02:03:23.381 --> 02:03:25.410
<v Speaker 2>love and understanding there about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of a,</v>

2651
02:03:25.860 --> 02:03:29.330
<v Speaker 2>about resources and elitism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2652
02:03:29.331 --> 02:03:31.820
<v Speaker 2>so he's interested in the one percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>and all that stuff.</v>

2653
02:03:31.840 --> 02:03:36.840
<v Speaker 2>I'm a bit interested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what more interested in is why are </v>

2654
02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:40.150
<v Speaker 2>our systems not more representative of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the divine puba truth that we can access</v>

2655
02:03:41.240 --> 02:03:42.890
<v Speaker 2>through spirituality?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2656
02:03:42.891 --> 02:03:47.891
<v Speaker 2>I think our systems are based on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>monkey need for survival and this sort </v>

2657
02:03:47.891 --> 02:03:47.891
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not good is it?</v>

2658
02:03:47.891 --> 02:03:49.160
<v Speaker 2>We should get beyond that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2659
02:03:49.161 --> 02:03:54.161
<v Speaker 2>I think we will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it takes a long fuCking </v>

2660
02:03:54.161 --> 02:03:54.161
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like we were talking about before.</v>

2661
02:03:54.161 --> 02:03:58.901
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you want to get the world to do </v>

2662
02:03:58.901 --> 02:03:58.901
<v Speaker 2>dmt tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2663
02:03:58.901 --> 02:03:58.901
<v Speaker 2>if we had a dmt day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boy,</v>

2664
02:03:58.901 --> 02:04:00.970
<v Speaker 2>that would change a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very interested in that.</v>

2665
02:04:01.750 --> 02:04:06.750
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the role of the role of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the shame and the role of the artist I </v>

2666
02:04:06.750 --> 02:04:08.150
<v Speaker 2>think is the role of the comic and even </v>
<v Speaker 2>the role of the shaman.</v>

2667
02:04:08.151 --> 02:04:10.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's important point that gets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That gets distorted.</v>

2668
02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:15.640
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of people that go down to </v>
<v Speaker 2>south America because they have this </v>

2669
02:04:15.640 --> 02:04:18.881
<v Speaker 2>romantic vision of what a shaman is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to do to them and that they're </v>

2670
02:04:18.881 --> 02:04:18.881
<v Speaker 2>going to go and experience and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>they.</v>

2671
02:04:18.881 --> 02:04:23.600
<v Speaker 2>They encounter some shyster who really </v>
<v Speaker 2>just learned how to make iowasca to prey</v>

2672
02:04:23.601 --> 02:04:24.730
<v Speaker 2>on gringos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's.</v>

2673
02:04:24.731 --> 02:04:29.731
<v Speaker 2>That's a big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>big part of the narrative that a lot of </v>

2674
02:04:29.731 --> 02:04:30.370
<v Speaker 2>people experience when they go down and </v>
<v Speaker 2>do that with the wrong people or.</v>

2675
02:04:30.600 --> 02:04:35.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not happens mainly thing because of </v>

2676
02:04:35.600 --> 02:04:37.500
<v Speaker 2>systems of commodification.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Materialism and profiteering does,</v>

2677
02:04:37.501 --> 02:04:38.310
<v Speaker 2>but it also.</v>

2678
02:04:38.310 --> 02:04:41.850
<v Speaker 3>It happens because people are just like </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at an opportunity there.</v>

2679
02:04:41.851 --> 02:04:43.010
<v Speaker 3>They're opportunistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're.</v>

2680
02:04:43.011 --> 02:04:45.000
<v Speaker 3>They're desperate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they had been mistreated,</v>

2681
02:04:45.001 --> 02:04:46.650
<v Speaker 3>maybe they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't.</v>

2682
02:04:46.980 --> 02:04:51.180
<v Speaker 3>They don't have a particularly healthy </v>
<v Speaker 3>view of human beings.</v>

2683
02:04:51.420 --> 02:04:52.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I recognize this.</v>

2684
02:04:52.531 --> 02:04:56.190
<v Speaker 2>I'm standing for men in my mind just </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the course of this conversation.</v>

2685
02:04:56.600 --> 02:04:58.140
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said earlier,</v>

2686
02:04:58.320 --> 02:05:01.440
<v Speaker 2>there's the potential for good and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential for bad in all of us.</v>

2687
02:05:01.450 --> 02:05:06.450
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I see our culture as a magnet and </v>

2688
02:05:06.450 --> 02:05:09.561
<v Speaker 2>the magnet is pulling out the worst </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff and what I think is it would be </v>

2689
02:05:09.561 --> 02:05:12.360
<v Speaker 2>possible to have a magnet that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>pulling out the best stuff,</v>

2690
02:05:12.361 --> 02:05:12.870
<v Speaker 2>but it has some</v>

2691
02:05:12.940 --> 02:05:14.970
<v Speaker 3>the best of to like what happened in </v>
<v Speaker 3>houston.</v>

2692
02:05:15.000 --> 02:05:20.000
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have this giant hurricane that </v>

2693
02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:21.651
<v Speaker 3>comes down in houston and I have put my </v>
<v Speaker 3>friend John Dudley went down down there </v>

2694
02:05:21.651 --> 02:05:25.191
<v Speaker 3>and brought supplies and was feeding </v>
<v Speaker 3>people and organized a bunch of other </v>

2695
02:05:25.191 --> 02:05:28.791
<v Speaker 3>people to help and do the same thing and</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a ton of people that were </v>

2696
02:05:28.791 --> 02:05:31.581
<v Speaker 3>doing the same ton of people that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>donating their time and their money and </v>

2697
02:05:31.581 --> 02:05:32.880
<v Speaker 3>they were using their boats to help get </v>
<v Speaker 3>people out of their homes.</v>

2698
02:05:33.030 --> 02:05:35.460
<v Speaker 3>And there's a video that I saw.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was an amazing video.</v>

2699
02:05:35.461 --> 02:05:37.850
<v Speaker 3>These two guys talking after they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>even know each other and they were,</v>

2700
02:05:37.870 --> 02:05:42.870
<v Speaker 3>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were being interviewed and they </v>

2701
02:05:42.870 --> 02:05:44.511
<v Speaker 3>were saying that the love that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>experienced helping all these people </v>

2702
02:05:44.511 --> 02:05:45.660
<v Speaker 3>pull,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pulling them out of the wreckage of this</v>

2703
02:05:45.661 --> 02:05:50.661
<v Speaker 3>horrible natural disaster that was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like nothing they'd ever felt </v>

2704
02:05:50.661 --> 02:05:54.850
<v Speaker 3>that this love was amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that all these people were being </v>

2705
02:05:54.850 --> 02:05:54.850
<v Speaker 3>completely altruistic.</v>

2706
02:05:54.850 --> 02:05:58.700
<v Speaker 3>They being completely generous and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>helping and just the I think in times of</v>

2707
02:05:59.251 --> 02:06:02.430
<v Speaker 3>crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you familiar with sebastian younger?</v>

2708
02:06:02.740 --> 02:06:07.740
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sebastian younger is an amazing war </v>

2709
02:06:07.740 --> 02:06:09.200
<v Speaker 3>journalist and he wrote a great book </v>
<v Speaker 3>Called tribe and his.</v>

2710
02:06:09.750 --> 02:06:14.750
<v Speaker 3>His book is essentially all about how </v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings really only feel at their </v>

2711
02:06:16.891 --> 02:06:21.891
<v Speaker 3>best and they're happiest when they are </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming together to overcome something </v>

2712
02:06:21.891 --> 02:06:26.150
<v Speaker 3>and so that in this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in this moment of overcoming this </v>

2713
02:06:26.150 --> 02:06:29.690
<v Speaker 3>incredible natural disaster that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>blame it on industrial capitalism and </v>

2714
02:06:30.241 --> 02:06:35.241
<v Speaker 3>global warming,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blame all that on the fucking the </v>

2715
02:06:35.241 --> 02:06:35.241
<v Speaker 3>hurricane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>At the end of the day,</v>

2716
02:06:35.241 --> 02:06:36.210
<v Speaker 3>it's a force of nature that no one saw </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming.</v>

2717
02:06:36.360 --> 02:06:38.520
<v Speaker 3>No one can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no one that pulled that trigger.</v>

2718
02:06:38.550 --> 02:06:43.550
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a guy in vegas that pulled that </v>

2719
02:06:43.550 --> 02:06:45.141
<v Speaker 3>trigger,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's no one that pulled the </v>

2720
02:06:45.141 --> 02:06:45.141
<v Speaker 3>trigger on that hurricane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was collective.</v>

2721
02:06:45.141 --> 02:06:45.141
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was.</v>

2722
02:06:45.141 --> 02:06:46.170
<v Speaker 3>It was a thing of nature.</v>

2723
02:06:46.300 --> 02:06:48.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't do that together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is beautiful.</v>

2724
02:06:48.781 --> 02:06:53.781
<v Speaker 2>What a coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Agree that anything we're human beings </v>

2725
02:06:53.781 --> 02:06:55.671
<v Speaker 2>come together like that is glorious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But both of those examples that you're </v>

2726
02:06:55.671 --> 02:06:56.380
<v Speaker 2>using as you yourself alluded to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2727
02:06:56.390 --> 02:06:59.860
<v Speaker 2>you can look at what conditions create </v>
<v Speaker 2>hurricane maybe,</v>

2728
02:06:59.910 --> 02:07:00.550
<v Speaker 2>possibly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2729
02:07:00.551 --> 02:07:01.050
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2730
02:07:01.051 --> 02:07:03.090
<v Speaker 2>We don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could have that hurricane.</v>

2731
02:07:03.150 --> 02:07:07.500
<v Speaker 2>Has hurricanes have happened forever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's my point.</v>

2732
02:07:07.530 --> 02:07:09.990
<v Speaker 2>That's only 50 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other 50 percent of my point is that</v>

2733
02:07:09.991 --> 02:07:12.840
<v Speaker 2>that guy pulling the trigger isn't just </v>
<v Speaker 2>an individual.</v>

2734
02:07:12.841 --> 02:07:15.330
<v Speaker 2>He is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you said when I was touching you on</v>

2735
02:07:15.331 --> 02:07:16.710
<v Speaker 2>the fucking shaming thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all,</v>

2736
02:07:16.711 --> 02:07:21.711
<v Speaker 2>maybe that shaman had a bad day and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why it's become a slippery </v>

2737
02:07:21.711 --> 02:07:21.711
<v Speaker 2>shaman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2738
02:07:21.711 --> 02:07:22.560
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a great band.</v>

2739
02:07:22.620 --> 02:07:24.460
<v Speaker 2>Slippery shaman like so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2740
02:07:24.570 --> 02:07:26.420
<v Speaker 2>so this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shoot,</v>

2741
02:07:26.670 --> 02:07:29.010
<v Speaker 2>like of course we all have individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>culpability,</v>

2742
02:07:29.011 --> 02:07:33.120
<v Speaker 2>but similarly he is a product of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture is a product of this again,</v>

2743
02:07:33.180 --> 02:07:34.610
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

2744
02:07:34.620 --> 02:07:36.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is one form of analysis</v>

2745
02:07:36.520 --> 02:07:41.520
<v Speaker 4>that says a meteorological disasters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're detached from reality and of </v>

2746
02:07:41.520 --> 02:07:45.420
<v Speaker 4>course meteorology is its own fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing and individual freewill near.</v>

2747
02:07:45.430 --> 02:07:47.070
<v Speaker 4>There are some newer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you know,</v>

2748
02:07:47.110 --> 02:07:52.110
<v Speaker 4>say that doesn't even fucking exists for</v>
<v Speaker 4>out in nature out in a meteorology.</v>

2749
02:07:52.391 --> 02:07:55.060
<v Speaker 4>The biochemistry of our system is </v>
<v Speaker 4>governing everything.</v>

2750
02:07:55.330 --> 02:08:00.330
<v Speaker 4>But certainly there are connections </v>
<v Speaker 4>between each of us that create the way </v>

2751
02:08:00.330 --> 02:08:01.280
<v Speaker 4>that we behave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2752
02:08:01.300 --> 02:08:03.640
<v Speaker 4>if like if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I haven't experienced in here where I</v>

2753
02:08:03.641 --> 02:08:08.641
<v Speaker 4>walk out feeling intimidated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe I'll be less kind to the people I </v>

2754
02:08:08.641 --> 02:08:13.021
<v Speaker 4>work with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a less extreme example of a brutal </v>

2755
02:08:13.021 --> 02:08:14.410
<v Speaker 4>murders and the more obvious example </v>
<v Speaker 4>aware of it,</v>

2756
02:08:14.440 --> 02:08:19.440
<v Speaker 3>we're aware of it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is one of the reasons why </v>

2757
02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:20.290
<v Speaker 3>altruistic behavior kind behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>loving community,</v>

2758
02:08:20.291 --> 02:08:22.420
<v Speaker 3>these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these things are rewarded because we</v>

2759
02:08:22.421 --> 02:08:26.800
<v Speaker 3>do understand that those do enforce a </v>
<v Speaker 3>better way of people behaving.</v>

2760
02:08:26.801 --> 02:08:29.670
<v Speaker 3>And that real determinism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like people like if you,</v>

2761
02:08:29.680 --> 02:08:34.680
<v Speaker 3>if you really truly don't have freewill,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well we know that we would like people </v>

2762
02:08:35.621 --> 02:08:40.621
<v Speaker 3>to behave kinder because whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>factors that play into people going out </v>

2763
02:08:41.231 --> 02:08:43.180
<v Speaker 3>and behaving in a nicer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kinder way,</v>

2764
02:08:43.360 --> 02:08:46.750
<v Speaker 3>there are part of that that we know that</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the fuel of that</v>

2765
02:08:46.850 --> 02:08:51.850
<v Speaker 4>so isn't then the role of us as </v>
<v Speaker 4>individuals finding our own conor </v>

2766
02:08:51.850 --> 02:08:52.670
<v Speaker 4>mcgregor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our own greatness,</v>

2767
02:08:52.690 --> 02:08:57.690
<v Speaker 4>out own heroism to create as much as </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible a spice for the altruism,</v>

2768
02:08:58.040 --> 02:09:03.040
<v Speaker 4>a spice for that philanthropy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a space for that togetherness to create </v>

2769
02:09:03.040 --> 02:09:03.040
<v Speaker 4>those moments,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you said,</v>

2770
02:09:03.040 --> 02:09:05.000
<v Speaker 4>without hurricane web and we've all </v>
<v Speaker 4>experienced there.</v>

2771
02:09:05.001 --> 02:09:07.220
<v Speaker 4>I know when I do something nice for </v>
<v Speaker 4>other people,</v>

2772
02:09:07.450 --> 02:09:08.210
<v Speaker 4>I start to feel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2773
02:09:08.211 --> 02:09:10.310
<v Speaker 4>this is what I'm meant to be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what I'm meant to be doing.</v>

2774
02:09:10.460 --> 02:09:13.160
<v Speaker 4>But I in my own personal life gets </v>
<v Speaker 4>sidetracked by our fuck.</v>

2775
02:09:13.161 --> 02:09:18.161
<v Speaker 4>I've got these economic imperatives on </v>
<v Speaker 4>want to fucking feel great about myself </v>

2776
02:09:18.161 --> 02:09:19.220
<v Speaker 4>because of other people's applause or </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2777
02:09:19.221 --> 02:09:24.221
<v Speaker 4>verification like it like because we are</v>
<v Speaker 4>all flawed because we are continually </v>

2778
02:09:24.221 --> 02:09:25.670
<v Speaker 4>going to battle between the monkey in </v>
<v Speaker 4>us.</v>

2779
02:09:25.710 --> 02:09:28.730
<v Speaker 4>The primary little creature in us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the great angel within us,</v>

2780
02:09:29.300 --> 02:09:34.300
<v Speaker 4>what if we have an agreement on a social</v>
<v Speaker 4>level that what we're aiming towards is </v>

2781
02:09:34.300 --> 02:09:35.720
<v Speaker 4>the most benevolent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the most beautiful,</v>

2782
02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:37.810
<v Speaker 4>and on an individual level we try and do</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

2783
02:09:37.820 --> 02:09:42.820
<v Speaker 4>and communally we encourage each other </v>
<v Speaker 4>towards it knowing that we're going to </v>

2784
02:09:42.820 --> 02:09:44.690
<v Speaker 4>fuck up and fail all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that we're heading in that direction</v>

2785
02:09:44.691 --> 02:09:49.691
<v Speaker 4>together instead of what we have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a system that is about make as </v>

2786
02:09:49.691 --> 02:09:50.450
<v Speaker 4>much money as you can and get out.</v>

2787
02:09:50.450 --> 02:09:52.400
<v Speaker 4>You only have 100 years line up the blow</v>
<v Speaker 4>jobs.</v>

2788
02:09:52.580 --> 02:09:57.580
<v Speaker 4>That is the system that we have that is </v>
<v Speaker 4>capitalist consumers and that's what </v>

2789
02:09:57.580 --> 02:09:58.310
<v Speaker 4>it's based on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a machine.</v>

2790
02:09:58.370 --> 02:10:03.370
<v Speaker 4>The machine makes money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's got to have infinite expanse and </v>

2791
02:10:03.370 --> 02:10:03.370
<v Speaker 4>infinite growth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is,</v>

2792
02:10:03.370 --> 02:10:05.840
<v Speaker 4>that is the system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that it's very fatalistic</v>

2793
02:10:05.841 --> 02:10:07.350
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It look fantastic.</v>

2794
02:10:07.420 --> 02:10:08.660
<v Speaker 4>I think we can change the world</v>

2795
02:10:09.140 --> 02:10:10.190
<v Speaker 3>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you're not.</v>

2796
02:10:10.280 --> 02:10:13.700
<v Speaker 3>You're not living that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the system that you're talking about,</v>

2797
02:10:13.730 --> 02:10:15.650
<v Speaker 3>it's escapable you've escaped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2798
02:10:15.730 --> 02:10:18.160
<v Speaker 3>And we.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about it and it's just no,</v>

2799
02:10:18.260 --> 02:10:23.260
<v Speaker 3>there's no like willy wonka golden </v>
<v Speaker 3>ticket that's going to get you out of </v>

2800
02:10:23.260 --> 02:10:23.260
<v Speaker 3>the system.</v>

2801
02:10:23.260 --> 02:10:25.180
<v Speaker 4>I don't trust him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shady fucking on polymers.</v>

2802
02:10:25.190 --> 02:10:30.190
<v Speaker 4>Where do you get them?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I doN't think I should even be working </v>

2803
02:10:30.190 --> 02:10:32.330
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Too much chocolate loss in that truck </v>

2804
02:10:32.330 --> 02:10:32.330
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That poor boy drowning.</v>

2805
02:10:32.330 --> 02:10:32.750
<v Speaker 4>And there was johnny depp behaving like </v>
<v Speaker 4>a young girl.</v>

2806
02:10:36.190 --> 02:10:38.990
<v Speaker 2>I've been lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A fucking movie man.</v>

2807
02:10:39.080 --> 02:10:41.450
<v Speaker 2>He's a weird way of talking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of questions.</v>

2808
02:10:41.451 --> 02:10:45.960
<v Speaker 2>I think it was about Michael Jackson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chocolate chocolates,</v>

2809
02:10:47.310 --> 02:10:51.790
<v Speaker 2>the peter pan type deal that clean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to grow up you.</v>

2810
02:10:52.420 --> 02:10:55.090
<v Speaker 2>I think you need to go back to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is.</v>

2811
02:10:55.600 --> 02:10:58.360
<v Speaker 2>It's chocolate factory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Johnny.</v>

2812
02:10:58.690 --> 02:11:00.830
<v Speaker 2>Look at my.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>

2813
02:11:00.840 --> 02:11:05.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this fatalistic thing that it's just </v>

2814
02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:05.840
<v Speaker 2>designed to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>

2815
02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:05.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's designed to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>

2816
02:11:05.901 --> 02:11:07.310
<v Speaker 2>I just think it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just,</v>

2817
02:11:07.430 --> 02:11:10.670
<v Speaker 2>it is an agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I even agree with that.</v>

2818
02:11:10.671 --> 02:11:15.671
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that what we live in is the </v>

2819
02:11:15.671 --> 02:11:15.671
<v Speaker 2>manifestation of our most primal </v>
<v Speaker 2>desires.</v>

2820
02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:18.620
<v Speaker 2>Greed or not even necessarily great </v>
<v Speaker 2>survival.</v>

2821
02:11:18.860 --> 02:11:21.200
<v Speaker 2>And I think that if you extrapolate on </v>
<v Speaker 2>that system,</v>

2822
02:11:21.201 --> 02:11:26.201
<v Speaker 2>you end up with what we've got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think an alternative way of being </v>

2823
02:11:26.201 --> 02:11:27.710
<v Speaker 2>something that might be a corrective </v>
<v Speaker 2>path for us is to look at those.</v>

2824
02:11:28.030 --> 02:11:31.160
<v Speaker 2>This feelings that you described of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>altruism in that hurricane,</v>

2825
02:11:31.400 --> 02:11:36.400
<v Speaker 2>the feeling of greatness in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual and the way that an </v>

2826
02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:36.400
<v Speaker 2>individual can pull communities together</v>
<v Speaker 2>is sort of like a.</v>

2827
02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:38.870
<v Speaker 2>It's not a binary choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know the world's more complicated than</v>

2828
02:11:38.871 --> 02:11:43.871
<v Speaker 2>that joe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like I suppose my quest and indeed </v>

2829
02:11:43.871 --> 02:11:45.380
<v Speaker 2>fuck me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my book is about how I individually have</v>

2830
02:11:45.410 --> 02:11:50.410
<v Speaker 2>got my head and I wrenched myself away </v>
<v Speaker 2>from selfishness and greed and pride on </v>

2831
02:11:50.410 --> 02:11:54.380
<v Speaker 2>a daily basis and pull myself towards </v>
<v Speaker 2>our tourism and love and self betterment</v>

2832
02:11:54.410 --> 02:11:56.960
<v Speaker 2>apart of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep myself fit mentally,</v>

2833
02:11:56.961 --> 02:11:59.600
<v Speaker 2>spiritually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I can be a better part of this.</v>

2834
02:12:00.230 --> 02:12:02.570
<v Speaker 2>Excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>system and perhaps through myself,</v>

2835
02:12:02.571 --> 02:12:05.390
<v Speaker 2>improvement create better systems </v>
<v Speaker 2>because there is all this energy.</v>

2836
02:12:05.391 --> 02:12:10.391
<v Speaker 2>There's all this power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's a shame that it gets </v>

2837
02:12:10.391 --> 02:12:10.650
<v Speaker 2>siphoned in a particular direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that,</v>

2838
02:12:10.720 --> 02:12:14.060
<v Speaker 2>that feeling you express and as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>express it and express it,</v>

2839
02:12:14.061 --> 02:12:19.061
<v Speaker 2>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that resonates with people and I think </v>

2840
02:12:19.061 --> 02:12:20.360
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're talking about is the 49 point</v>

2841
02:12:20.361 --> 02:12:25.361
<v Speaker 2>nine percent and 50 point one percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>that rick strassman was describing.</v>

2842
02:12:25.430 --> 02:12:28.220
<v Speaker 2>It was this constant battle and it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not an easy path.</v>

2843
02:12:28.280 --> 02:12:30.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't think the system operates it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The 50,</v>

2844
02:12:30.081 --> 02:12:35.081
<v Speaker 2>49,</v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore I think the system's way way </v>

2845
02:12:35.081 --> 02:12:37.691
<v Speaker 2>towards the negative system like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cultural system and the economic system,</v>

2846
02:12:37.940 --> 02:12:42.940
<v Speaker 2>human beings in this world is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>capitalist country or where they say I </v>

2847
02:12:43.431 --> 02:12:45.440
<v Speaker 2>don't know enough about what goes down </v>
<v Speaker 2>in China.</v>

2848
02:12:45.500 --> 02:12:47.870
<v Speaker 2>So I'll say like sort of global </v>
<v Speaker 2>capitalism.</v>

2849
02:12:47.871 --> 02:12:49.550
<v Speaker 2>Say and again I'm not a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>economist.</v>

2850
02:12:49.551 --> 02:12:52.310
<v Speaker 2>I'm just picking up shit from listening </v>

<v Speaker 3>it was literally hurting my ears.</v>

<v Speaker 3>little small chain.</v>

2908
02:15:10.520 --> 02:15:15.520
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it shows you that they could </v>

2909
02:15:15.520 --> 02:15:19.390
<v Speaker 3>figure out a way through just their art </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get to this weird position where I </v>

2910
02:15:20.121 --> 02:15:22.790
<v Speaker 3>mean if not really does make a Billion </v>
<v Speaker 3>dollars.</v>

2911
02:15:22.791 --> 02:15:26.330
<v Speaker 3>Like fuck still makes amazing music </v>
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>

2912
02:15:26.570 --> 02:15:31.570
<v Speaker 3>That's my point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My point is that his music never went </v>

2913
02:15:31.570 --> 02:15:31.570
<v Speaker 3>commercial smoothies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking fantastic.</v>

2914
02:15:31.570 --> 02:15:34.930
<v Speaker 5>Someone was saying I was reading some </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff that he supposedly tried.</v>

2915
02:15:34.931 --> 02:15:39.931
<v Speaker 5>Remember he had a rap battle up beef had</v>
<v Speaker 5>a couple of beats jz with like puff </v>

2916
02:15:39.931 --> 02:15:42.520
<v Speaker 5>daddy the hate me now thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh that he like,</v>

2917
02:15:42.521 --> 02:15:44.650
<v Speaker 5>he also wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ghost wrote for wilson myth.</v>

2918
02:15:44.651 --> 02:15:46.330
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what that really means.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's sold out,</v>

2919
02:15:46.331 --> 02:15:49.090
<v Speaker 5>but that's not selling out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's just writing for a friend.</v>

2920
02:15:49.330 --> 02:15:51.580
<v Speaker 5>But the rap battles I think is more just</v>
<v Speaker 5>an ego thing.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Someone talk shit about him.</v>

<v Speaker 2>the steps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I talk through like this is what it's </v>

2945
02:17:02.611 --> 02:17:02.611
<v Speaker 2>like to be in mY fucking head.</v>

2947
02:17:03.671 --> 02:17:07.780
<v Speaker 2>causes all these problems all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I run into these people and say,</v>

2948
02:17:07.781 --> 02:17:09.880
<v Speaker 2>all I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've run into them and I start,</v>

2949
02:17:09.881 --> 02:17:12.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go and talk to them </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I feel so self conscious because</v>

2950
02:17:12.251 --> 02:17:13.530
<v Speaker 2>I've looked kind of like cool.</v>

2951

<v Speaker 2>I've got these people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to feel inadequate.</v>

2953
02:17:16.840 --> 02:17:19.930
<v Speaker 2>All I know is how I feel and that's all </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll ever know unless I learn.</v>

2954
02:17:19.990 --> 02:17:24.520
<v Speaker 2>I can learn a new system for being bill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This guy comes over and says hello while</v>

2955
02:17:24.521 --> 02:17:26.200
<v Speaker 2>I stand now on the goose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit,</v>

2956
02:17:26.260 --> 02:17:29.890
<v Speaker 2>we're on this sort of riverbank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vaguely embarrassed by bear.</v>

2957
02:17:29.891 --> 02:17:34.090
<v Speaker 2>My dog bears looping enthusiasm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard you on joe rogan.</v>

2958
02:17:34.091 --> 02:17:35.380
<v Speaker 2>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joe rogan,</v>

2959
02:17:35.381 --> 02:17:40.381
<v Speaker 2>the former mixed martial artist </v>
<v Speaker 2>commentate a comedian and host of the </v>

2960
02:17:40.381 --> 02:17:44.341
<v Speaker 2>world's most downloaded podcast is </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself an interesting example of new </v>

2961
02:17:44.341 --> 02:17:46.870
<v Speaker 2>emerging models of masculinity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fusion of right wing individualism,</v>

2962
02:17:46.871 --> 02:17:49.180
<v Speaker 2>a new age tolerance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a fierce auto didact.</v>

2963
02:17:49.420 --> 02:17:52.900
<v Speaker 2>he has become a champion of american </v>
<v Speaker 2>libertarianism is to me,</v>

2964
02:17:52.901 --> 02:17:55.780
<v Speaker 2>fascinating because he's clever and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good fighter.</v>

2965
02:17:56.260 --> 02:18:01.260
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's me mentioning you in passing </v>

2966
02:18:01.260 --> 02:18:01.260
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went over whenever he wrote here.</v>

2967
02:18:01.260 --> 02:18:04.590
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you better put in seemingly because I </v>

2968
02:18:04.590 --> 02:18:05.140
<v Speaker 2>think a footnote in reductive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're saying miksang,</v>

2969
02:18:05.141 --> 02:18:08.140
<v Speaker 2>right wing individualism and newark,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what do you think about that,</v>

2970
02:18:08.141 --> 02:18:09.100
<v Speaker 2>joe?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are.</v>

2971
02:18:10.300 --> 02:18:13.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how much right wing I have </v>
<v Speaker 2>in me.</v>

2972
02:18:13.220 --> 02:18:18.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm exactly libertarian libertarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>right wing stuff is probably,</v>

2973
02:18:18.251 --> 02:18:20.050
<v Speaker 2>if you talk to a real bright winger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'd go,</v>

2974
02:18:20.051 --> 02:18:21.670
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck you're talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2975
02:18:21.671 --> 02:18:22.510
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2976
02:18:22.511 --> 02:18:25.510
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of libertarianism would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have sort of covered it better,</v>

2977
02:18:25.511 --> 02:18:27.340
<v Speaker 2>but this was written a point where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't.</v>

2978
02:18:27.400 --> 02:18:32.350
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't listened to as much stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I've changed in this amount.</v>
