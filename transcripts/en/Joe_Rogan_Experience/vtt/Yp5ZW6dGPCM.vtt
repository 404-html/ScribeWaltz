00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.650
<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience,</v>

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.680
<v Speaker 1>how much of a real issue is it when people get fat is mold or just knocks fat?</v>

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.390
<v Speaker 1>Fat itself isn't being fat itself.</v>

4
00:00:09.391 --> 00:00:11.730
<v Speaker 1>How much of an effect is being overweight?</v>

5
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.630
<v Speaker 1>It has a big effect,</v>

6
00:00:12.631 --> 00:00:13.260
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

7
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.670
<v Speaker 1>That's less of a a two actually.</v>

8
00:00:14.671 --> 00:00:16.020
<v Speaker 1>It can be triggered by toxins,</v>

9
00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:17.970
<v Speaker 1>but it's more of a metabolic energy thing.</v>

10
00:00:17.971 --> 00:00:19.650
<v Speaker 1>And that's the other side of what I do.</v>

11
00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:20.040
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

12
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.450
<v Speaker 1>with the supplements that I make,</v>

13
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:22.950
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

14
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.170
<v Speaker 1>it's about increasing mitochondrial function.</v>

15
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.820
<v Speaker 1>And if you have a fueling problem in energy management problem in your body and</v>

16
00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:31.320
<v Speaker 1>being fat as a great sign of that,</v>

17
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.020
<v Speaker 1>you need to figure out why and you need to correct it.</v>

18
00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.880
<v Speaker 1>Because when your body works well,</v>

19
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:36.900
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be fat.</v>

20
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.380
<v Speaker 1>Have you noticed this trend where you're not supposed to bring up the fact that</v>

21
00:00:40.381 --> 00:00:42.510
<v Speaker 1>people are fat and it's called fat shaming?</v>

22
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:44.280
<v Speaker 1>Have we seen this?</v>

23
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.890
<v Speaker 1>I've seen some things on Facebook discussing,</v>

24
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.170
<v Speaker 1>discussing fat or even better celebrating the fact that you're thin is fat</v>

25
00:00:51.391 --> 00:00:52.224
<v Speaker 1>shaming.</v>

26
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:53.130
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

27
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.890
<v Speaker 1>There was a woman fucking people.</v>

28
00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.010
<v Speaker 1>What about thin shaming?</v>

29
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.221
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

30
00:00:56.221 --> 00:00:56.821
<v Speaker 1>you know what it is,</v>

31
00:00:56.821 --> 00:00:57.061
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

32
00:00:57.061 --> 00:01:00.240
<v Speaker 1>It's just people trying to find some sort of an excuse for why they are the way</v>

33
00:01:00.241 --> 00:01:04.950
<v Speaker 1>they are and then the excuse to continue to be the way they are without feeling</v>

34
00:01:04.951 --> 00:01:07.770
<v Speaker 1>any repercussions from socially from other people.</v>

35
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.700
<v Speaker 1>This is a woman,</v>

36
00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.481
<v Speaker 1>she had this picture,</v>

37
00:01:09.481 --> 00:01:10.440
<v Speaker 1>she put it on Facebook,</v>

38
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.191
<v Speaker 1>it's her.</v>

39
00:01:11.191 --> 00:01:13.290
<v Speaker 1>She's in a bikini show or like a little,</v>

40
00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.651
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:13.651 --> 00:01:15.630
<v Speaker 1>one of those little crossfit outfits or something like that,</v>

42
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.520
<v Speaker 1>and she has her three kids there.</v>

43
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:17.971
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

44
00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:19.950
<v Speaker 1>I saw that picture and the picture says,</v>

45
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.570
<v Speaker 1>what's your excuse?</v>

46
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.030
<v Speaker 1>And people were saying,</v>

47
00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:25.050
<v Speaker 1>you're fat shaming.</v>

48
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.280
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people have different lives,</v>

49
00:01:26.281 --> 00:01:29.940
<v Speaker 1>like whether or not someone has a different life and whether or not someone has</v>

50
00:01:29.941 --> 00:01:31.080
<v Speaker 1>a different issue with their body,</v>

51
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:32.760
<v Speaker 1>that's not what she's saying.</v>

52
00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:33.481
<v Speaker 1>She's saying,</v>

53
00:01:33.481 --> 00:01:34.261
<v Speaker 1>what's your excuse?</v>

54
00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:36.090
<v Speaker 1>Because this is what she's been able to do.</v>

55
00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.170
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

56
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.040
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's different.</v>

57
00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.641
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>

58
00:01:38.641 --> 00:01:42.630
<v Speaker 1>Some people have a bad situation that they're in financially.</v>

59
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.460
<v Speaker 1>Some people have bad genetics,</v>

60
00:01:44.461 --> 00:01:47.130
<v Speaker 1>some people they've been taught poorly.</v>

61
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:48.690
<v Speaker 1>Whatever diseases,</v>

62
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.853
<v Speaker 1>all the above.</v>

63
00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.450
<v Speaker 1>But that's not fat shaming.</v>

64
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.730
<v Speaker 1>She's celebrating the fact that she's thin.</v>

65
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

66
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.980
<v Speaker 1>and this,</v>

67
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.980
<v Speaker 1>this fat shaming thing that people love to say now is it completely alleviates</v>

68
00:02:00.421 --> 00:02:03.390
<v Speaker 1>any responsibility you have for your own physical shape.</v>

69
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.980
<v Speaker 1>It's like they want it.</v>

70
00:02:04.981 --> 00:02:09.981
<v Speaker 1>They want to take it out of the equation that that social aspect of being fat,</v>

71
00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:11.790
<v Speaker 1>like there's a reason for it.</v>

72
00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.490
<v Speaker 1>The reason for it is it's not healthy for you.</v>

73
00:02:14.491 --> 00:02:15.324
<v Speaker 1>There's the girl.</v>

74
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.620
<v Speaker 1>If you look at that picture up there,</v>

75
00:02:16.621 --> 00:02:17.401
<v Speaker 1>what's your excuse?</v>

76
00:02:17.401 --> 00:02:18.234
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

77
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.640
<v Speaker 1>but either there's a reason why that exists is because people see what you're</v>

78
00:02:23.641 --> 00:02:26.610
<v Speaker 1>doing and they don't like the way it looks on you because they're scared of it</v>

79
00:02:26.611 --> 00:02:27.510
<v Speaker 1>being on them.</v>

80
00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.300
<v Speaker 1>When someone sees a in a morbidly obese person,</v>

81
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.510
<v Speaker 1>the reason why they're staring,</v>

82
00:02:31.511 --> 00:02:33.090
<v Speaker 1>he's not going to try to shame that person.</v>

83
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.220
<v Speaker 1>It's a natural freak out.</v>

84
00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.810
<v Speaker 1>Your body recognizes,</v>

85
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.673
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>

86
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.180
<v Speaker 1>that's possible too.</v>

87
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:40.380
<v Speaker 1>I could do that.</v>

88
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.011
<v Speaker 1>God down.</v>

89
00:02:41.011 --> 00:02:41.970
<v Speaker 1>I better not do that.</v>

90
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.960
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do that.</v>

91
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.561
<v Speaker 1>That guy looks,</v>

92
00:02:43.561 --> 00:02:44.490
<v Speaker 1>it looks awful.</v>

93
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:44.851
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

94
00:02:44.851 --> 00:02:45.720
<v Speaker 1>that guy's going to die.</v>

95
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.130
<v Speaker 1>That's not fat shaming.</v>

96
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.190
<v Speaker 1>That's a natural thing that people do with a recognize success and failure in</v>

97
00:02:52.921 --> 00:02:57.450
<v Speaker 1>their environment and that success and failure is as much social success and</v>

98
00:02:57.451 --> 00:03:00.310
<v Speaker 1>failure as it is physiological health.</v>

99
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.860
<v Speaker 1>If you see someone that's super unhealthy,</v>

100
00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.440
<v Speaker 1>coughing and smoking a cigarette,</v>

101
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.520
<v Speaker 1>that feeling is not cigarette smoking shaming,</v>

102
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 1>okay?</v>

103
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.770
<v Speaker 1>That feeling is you're recognizing that someone is doing something incredibly</v>

104
00:03:14.771 --> 00:03:17.830
<v Speaker 1>unhealthy and that possibility exists for you too.</v>

105
00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.730
<v Speaker 1>Here's,</v>

106
00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:19.241
<v Speaker 1>here's the thing,</v>

107
00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:19.600
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

108
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.750
<v Speaker 1>that feeling is not a rational response.</v>

109
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.900
<v Speaker 1>It's a self defense system in the body that happens before you even think about</v>

110
00:03:25.901 --> 00:03:26.230
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

111
00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.710
<v Speaker 1>This is the body going like,</v>

112
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.270
<v Speaker 1>like naturally animals don't want to spend time with other sick animals either.</v>

113
00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:34.600
<v Speaker 1>Like they'll move away from the sick ones and when we see someone,</v>

114
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:35.643
<v Speaker 1>when our body,</v>

115
00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.000
<v Speaker 1>our meat operating systems,</v>

116
00:03:37.001 --> 00:03:37.751
<v Speaker 1>see someone who is sick,</v>

117
00:03:37.751 --> 00:03:39.190
<v Speaker 1>we naturally want to create space.</v>

118
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:40.780
<v Speaker 1>But here's the thing,</v>

119
00:03:40.781 --> 00:03:41.980
<v Speaker 1>so I weighed 300 pounds.</v>

120
00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:44.290
<v Speaker 1>I was fat for like half of my life and let me tell you,</v>

121
00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:46.480
<v Speaker 1>every fat person on earth knows they're fat.</v>

122
00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.870
<v Speaker 1>They do not feel happy about it and they desperately want to fix it,</v>

123
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.310
<v Speaker 1>but they don't want you to rub it in their face.</v>

124
00:03:51.311 --> 00:03:51.941
<v Speaker 1>Dave Asprey,</v>

125
00:03:51.941 --> 00:03:53.140
<v Speaker 1>cause that's fat shaming.</v>

126
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.630
<v Speaker 1>You make me feel bad if you show your six pack,</v>

127
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.300
<v Speaker 1>if you just pull that up like 15 minutes a month,</v>

128
00:03:58.301 --> 00:04:01.660
<v Speaker 1>pitch boom and show that six pack on on Instagram,</v>

129
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.930
<v Speaker 1>you're fat shaming areas that could fucking workout every morning,</v>

130
00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.500
<v Speaker 1>an hour and a half a day.</v>

131
00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.550
<v Speaker 1>Get yourself in shape,</v>

132
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.240
<v Speaker 1>take a picture and people will be angry because they didn't.</v>

133
00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.800
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>

134
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:15.350
<v Speaker 1>There will be that.</v>

135
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

136
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:16.950
<v Speaker 1>That's not what the scribe.</v>

137
00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.070
<v Speaker 1>Well of course,</v>

138
00:04:18.071 --> 00:04:19.600
<v Speaker 1>but they're saying you're fat shaming.</v>

139
00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.840
<v Speaker 1>They're angry because they're trying desperately stuff that doesn't work and</v>

140
00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:26.740
<v Speaker 1>when it doesn't knock often there's some people who just have given up.</v>

141
00:04:26.741 --> 00:04:27.760
<v Speaker 1>I would say most,</v>

142
00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.210
<v Speaker 1>I would say most people who are talking about fat shaming or just stuffing</v>

143
00:04:31.211 --> 00:04:31.961
<v Speaker 1>Twinkies down there,</v>

144
00:04:31.961 --> 00:04:32.770
<v Speaker 1>fucking mug.</v>

145
00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:35.680
<v Speaker 1>The people talking about fat shaming have emotional issues,</v>

146
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:36.700
<v Speaker 1>I would guess,</v>

147
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.950
<v Speaker 1>but you ain't find support online.</v>

148
00:04:38.951 --> 00:04:40.390
<v Speaker 1>That's what I find fascinating.</v>

149
00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.710
<v Speaker 1>People agree with them.</v>

150
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.020
<v Speaker 1>The people that called that woman a fat shamer.</v>

151
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.960
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of them and she,</v>

152
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.410
<v Speaker 1>she had to apologize,</v>

153
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.480
<v Speaker 1>but she was disingenuous in your apology.</v>

154
00:04:49.481 --> 00:04:50.370
<v Speaker 1>And I just,</v>

155
00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.130
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

156
00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.370
<v Speaker 1>I feel a lot of compassion for she explain why she just disingenuous.</v>

157
00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.860
<v Speaker 1>She did some interview where she was talking about,</v>

158
00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:57.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

159
00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.450
<v Speaker 1>like when she said,</v>

160
00:04:58.451 --> 00:04:59.710
<v Speaker 1>what's your excuse?</v>

161
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.860
<v Speaker 1>Like she can't came up with some sort of a real softening down version of what</v>

162
00:05:04.991 --> 00:05:05.801
<v Speaker 1>she meant by,</v>

163
00:05:05.801 --> 00:05:07.060
<v Speaker 1>what's your excuse,</v>

164
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.841
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

165
00:05:07.841 --> 00:05:10.060
<v Speaker 1>But what she meant is she's not fat.</v>

166
00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.391
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

167
00:05:10.391 --> 00:05:11.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm hot.</v>

168
00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:11.711
<v Speaker 1>What's your excuse?</v>

169
00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:12.401
<v Speaker 1>Here's my kids.</v>

170
00:05:12.401 --> 00:05:12.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm a hot,</v>

171
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.290
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty obvious what she meant.</v>

172
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.341
<v Speaker 1>And she was like,</v>

173
00:05:15.341 --> 00:05:18.000
<v Speaker 1>what's your excuse for not meeting your goals or what?</v>

174
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:20.200
<v Speaker 1>I kind of get mad though,</v>

175
00:05:20.201 --> 00:05:23.260
<v Speaker 1>when people say your excuses that you're lazy and you're excuses that you didn't</v>

176
00:05:23.261 --> 00:05:26.380
<v Speaker 1>work out enough and you didn't it enough because I beat myself up.</v>

177
00:05:26.381 --> 00:05:27.580
<v Speaker 1>I broke my metabolism,</v>

178
00:05:27.581 --> 00:05:29.740
<v Speaker 1>I broke my thyroid gland working out all the time,</v>

179
00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:30.461
<v Speaker 1>eating a low fat,</v>

180
00:05:30.461 --> 00:05:33.670
<v Speaker 1>low calorie diet and all it did was make me fat and sick and tired.</v>

181
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:34.870
<v Speaker 1>Like it doesn't work.</v>

182
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.500
<v Speaker 1>So it,</v>

183
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.220
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

184
00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.790
<v Speaker 1>it's really annoying when you get these people who are genetically gifted have a</v>

185
00:05:39.791 --> 00:05:43.840
<v Speaker 1>good metabolism and never got a chronic illness or whatever the heck works.</v>

186
00:05:43.841 --> 00:05:46.360
<v Speaker 1>So they could basically look good without too much work.</v>

187
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.480
<v Speaker 1>And they stand up there and say,</v>

188
00:05:47.481 --> 00:05:47.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

189
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:48.910
<v Speaker 1>you didn't do enough of this.</v>

190
00:05:48.911 --> 00:05:51.040
<v Speaker 1>But when the fat people try and go for a jog,</v>

191
00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:51.940
<v Speaker 1>when you weigh 300 pounds,</v>

192
00:05:51.941 --> 00:05:52.720
<v Speaker 1>he's trying to go for a jog.</v>

193
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.620
<v Speaker 1>It's destructive on your tissues so you can all these fat people who are trying</v>

194
00:05:56.621 --> 00:05:59.840
<v Speaker 1>and just failing miserably and feeling bad about themselves cause they did it</v>

195
00:05:59.841 --> 00:06:01.190
<v Speaker 1>because they got the wrong advice.</v>

196
00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.560
<v Speaker 1>Like this is why I started just putting some of this stuff up there.</v>

197
00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to work,</v>

198
00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:06.170
<v Speaker 1>I don't have food cravings,</v>

199
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.020
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff I had struggled with like for a lot of my life.</v>

200
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.480
<v Speaker 1>It just isn't something I have to think about anymore.</v>

201
00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:14.570
<v Speaker 1>And it kind of upsets me when I see,</v>

202
00:06:14.571 --> 00:06:14.811
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

203
00:06:14.811 --> 00:06:18.500
<v Speaker 1>fat people who are feeling guilty and like fighting all their willpower on</v>

204
00:06:18.501 --> 00:06:18.710
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

205
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:23.000
<v Speaker 1>on these cravings that cause like they're doing it wrong but they don't know</v>

206
00:06:23.001 --> 00:06:25.010
<v Speaker 1>they're doing it wrong so that then they feel guilty and they get caught in all</v>

207
00:06:25.011 --> 00:06:26.990
<v Speaker 1>this emotional stuff and like it's unnecessary.</v>

208
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:28.071
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

209
00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:33.071
<v Speaker 1>It seems like there's gotta be a way to get healthy food to people and make it a</v>

210
00:06:34.071 --> 00:06:36.470
<v Speaker 1>part of everyone's everyday diet.</v>

211
00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:41.310
<v Speaker 1>But then you start considering the numbers of people in Los Angeles and if</v>

212
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:42.680
<v Speaker 1>there's 20 million people,</v>

213
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:42.981
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

214
00:06:42.981 --> 00:06:47.981
<v Speaker 1>getting everybody grasp red beef and getting everybody and see tea oil take</v>

215
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:48.381
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>

216
00:06:48.381 --> 00:06:50.180
<v Speaker 1>Some golf courses are gonna have to put cows on them.</v>

217
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:51.290
<v Speaker 1>Is that what they're going to have to do?</v>

218
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.240
<v Speaker 1>You can feed an awful lot of cows and some of these grounds,</v>

219
00:06:53.241 --> 00:06:54.800
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to stop people from golfing.</v>

220
00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:56.360
<v Speaker 1>It's too many rich dudes like golfing.</v>

221
00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:00.410
<v Speaker 1>I needs to be a fast food company and it just takes over and just starts doing</v>

222
00:07:00.411 --> 00:07:03.350
<v Speaker 1>it because that's the biggest problem is people just need fast food,</v>

223
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:04.910
<v Speaker 1>fast food.</v>

224
00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:05.743
<v Speaker 1>Actually healthy.</v>

225
00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:06.920
<v Speaker 1>There's a couple attempts.</v>

226
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:08.120
<v Speaker 1>There's a guy from,</v>

227
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.510
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

228
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:12.500
<v Speaker 1>one of the early wholefoods guys and some Mcdonald's guys got together and like</v>

229
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.150
<v Speaker 1>they'll make something that's,</v>

230
00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:14.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

231
00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:15.180
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

232
00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm forgetting the name of what they're trying to do,</v>

233
00:07:16.701 --> 00:07:18.260
<v Speaker 1>but they'll make something that's better than it was.</v>

234
00:07:18.261 --> 00:07:19.880
<v Speaker 1>But is it going to be non GMO even?</v>

235
00:07:19.881 --> 00:07:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Is it going to be gluten free now?</v>

236
00:07:21.591 --> 00:07:24.830
<v Speaker 1>Probably not because we have to understand the core tenants of what makes us</v>

237
00:07:24.831 --> 00:07:28.070
<v Speaker 1>healthy and we have to understand those widely before there's demand for them.</v>

238
00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:28.670
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

239
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:29.330
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

240
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:33.350
<v Speaker 1>so the number one predictor for whether you're going to be obese or not is your</v>

241
00:07:33.351 --> 00:07:34.184
<v Speaker 1>income level.</v>

242
00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:35.180
<v Speaker 1>The poorer you are,</v>

243
00:07:35.181 --> 00:07:36.020
<v Speaker 1>the fatter you are.</v>

244
00:07:36.021 --> 00:07:39.410
<v Speaker 1>That's especially true in America and that's a food quality issue.</v>

245
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:40.130
<v Speaker 1>And it,</v>

246
00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:40.963
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

247
00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:43.280
<v Speaker 1>it's just not fair the way things are set up that way.</v>

248
00:07:43.281 --> 00:07:44.690
<v Speaker 1>But if you're poor,</v>

249
00:07:44.691 --> 00:07:47.050
<v Speaker 1>you have a hard time getting food that doesn't make you inflamed.</v>

250
00:07:47.051 --> 00:07:48.020
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't break your insulin.</v>

251
00:07:48.021 --> 00:07:50.240
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't contain things that make you weak in it.</v>

252
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.850
<v Speaker 1>And like it's,</v>

253
00:07:51.851 --> 00:07:52.641
<v Speaker 1>it's tragic.</v>

254
00:07:52.641 --> 00:07:53.331
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't be that way.</v>

255
00:07:53.331 --> 00:07:54.164
<v Speaker 1>But that's how it is.</v>

256
00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:58.760
<v Speaker 1>There's a blog I read about thin privilege just to sit there.</v>

257
00:07:58.761 --> 00:07:59.481
<v Speaker 1>That's another thing.</v>

258
00:07:59.481 --> 00:08:01.490
<v Speaker 1>That's another way of saying fat shaming.</v>

259
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:05.960
<v Speaker 1>The other side of saying fat shaming is that being thin you are enjoying thin</v>

260
00:08:05.961 --> 00:08:09.770
<v Speaker 1>privilege and that by creating success and all that,</v>

261
00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.570
<v Speaker 1>not just dating success but the way people dress you and the way you move around</v>

262
00:08:14.571 --> 00:08:18.680
<v Speaker 1>in society that you enjoy thin privilege and what they're trying to do is</v>

263
00:08:18.681 --> 00:08:23.681
<v Speaker 1>compare being in shape with being a white male like white male privilege is</v>

264
00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.720
<v Speaker 1>white male privilege is almost shameful.</v>

265
00:08:26.930 --> 00:08:27.291
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

266
00:08:27.291 --> 00:08:30.590
<v Speaker 1>it's almost shameful to have this white male privilege while people are still,</v>

267
00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:30.981
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

268
00:08:30.981 --> 00:08:32.120
<v Speaker 1>it makes you feel,</v>

269
00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:32.900
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

270
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:33.531
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

271
00:08:33.531 --> 00:08:33.860
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

272
00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.200
<v Speaker 1>like if someone talks about white male privilege,</v>

273
00:08:36.201 --> 00:08:40.450
<v Speaker 1>what do you think of you think of someone being aloof to the concerns of,</v>

274
00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:45.570
<v Speaker 1>of Brown people and poor people and racism and also allude to the fact that they</v>

275
00:08:47.301 --> 00:08:52.301
<v Speaker 1>got super lucky they got this lucky roll the dice and were born in this way that</v>

276
00:08:53.391 --> 00:08:54.980
<v Speaker 1>allows them to be,</v>

277
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:59.140
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you think about white males in thinking about white males and you</v>

278
00:08:59.141 --> 00:09:00.090
<v Speaker 1>think about wealth,</v>

279
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:03.750
<v Speaker 1>majority of the like super wealthy people are white males.</v>

280
00:09:03.930 --> 00:09:06.390
<v Speaker 1>The majority of the people that are in positions of power,</v>

281
00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:07.320
<v Speaker 1>whether it's presidents,</v>

282
00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.100
<v Speaker 1>mayor,</v>

283
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:08.933
<v Speaker 1>white males,</v>

284
00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.940
<v Speaker 1>so that white male being a white male and having that privilege,</v>

285
00:09:11.941 --> 00:09:13.260
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like being in a pig.</v>

286
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.350
<v Speaker 1>It's like being the man so thin privilege.</v>

287
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:18.540
<v Speaker 1>They haven't figured out a way to make being thin,</v>

288
00:09:18.541 --> 00:09:19.374
<v Speaker 1>being a pig</v>

289
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:22.910
<v Speaker 1>that is so thin,</v>

290
00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:23.391
<v Speaker 1>privileged,</v>

291
00:09:23.391 --> 00:09:24.240
<v Speaker 1>not I'm fat,</v>

292
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.760
<v Speaker 1>not on lazy food.</v>

293
00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:27.990
<v Speaker 1>Like just you know,</v>

294
00:09:27.991 --> 00:09:31.350
<v Speaker 1>re re I didn't re renaming words to mean something different.</v>

295
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:31.720
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

296
00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:32.670
<v Speaker 1>it's a little bit of that,</v>

297
00:09:32.671 --> 00:09:33.540
<v Speaker 1>but it's also,</v>

298
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:34.290
<v Speaker 1>it's um,</v>

299
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:35.190
<v Speaker 1>you pulled up the blog,</v>

300
00:09:35.191 --> 00:09:35.371
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

301
00:09:35.371 --> 00:09:36.450
<v Speaker 1>Brian did you pull up one of the ones?</v>

302
00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:41.550
<v Speaker 1>It's also alleviating themselves a personal responsibility and finding a new</v>

303
00:09:41.551 --> 00:09:42.810
<v Speaker 1>victim or a new,</v>

304
00:09:42.910 --> 00:09:47.910
<v Speaker 1>a new culprit and the culprit is not their own lack of self respect or their own</v>

305
00:09:48.241 --> 00:09:52.920
<v Speaker 1>willpower or their own ability to discipline themselves or their own ability to</v>

306
00:09:52.921 --> 00:09:55.740
<v Speaker 1>educate themselves on proper nutrition that's out of the equation.</v>

307
00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.810
<v Speaker 1>It's no longer their responsibility.</v>

308
00:09:57.811 --> 00:10:01.080
<v Speaker 1>Now instead they'll concentrate on thin people having,</v>

309
00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:01.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

310
00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:05.310
<v Speaker 1>an acid fits in an actual airplane seat and you know,</v>

311
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.880
<v Speaker 1>being able to squeeze on an actual escalator,</v>

312
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:09.301
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

313
00:10:09.301 --> 00:10:10.320
<v Speaker 1>all of these things,</v>

314
00:10:10.390 --> 00:10:13.530
<v Speaker 1>these fat fucks are complaining about and calling thin privilege.</v>

315
00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.700
<v Speaker 1>You've got knock willpower.</v>

316
00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:15.450
<v Speaker 1>That list,</v>

317
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:20.130
<v Speaker 1>there is no lack of will power and fat people willpower's a finite resource.</v>

318
00:10:20.131 --> 00:10:20.821
<v Speaker 1>You have so much.</v>

319
00:10:20.821 --> 00:10:22.470
<v Speaker 1>You can we prove this beyond a doubt.</v>

320
00:10:22.650 --> 00:10:23.880
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean willpower?</v>

321
00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:25.440
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole book about this now,</v>

322
00:10:25.441 --> 00:10:27.840
<v Speaker 1>and I'm of course for getting the name of the author,</v>

323
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:31.020
<v Speaker 1>but they actually show that there's so many decisions you can make.</v>

324
00:10:31.021 --> 00:10:32.220
<v Speaker 1>I wrote about this a while back,</v>

325
00:10:32.221 --> 00:10:35.370
<v Speaker 1>there's decision making fatigue and there's x amount of willpower and you can</v>

326
00:10:35.371 --> 00:10:36.870
<v Speaker 1>apply that willpower to change the world.</v>

327
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:39.900
<v Speaker 1>Or you can apply that willpower to say no to the bullet chips in front of you.</v>

328
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:40.950
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

329
00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.590
<v Speaker 1>And if you're a fat person and your energy reserves are low,</v>

330
00:10:43.591 --> 00:10:45.150
<v Speaker 1>and I say this from personal experience,</v>

331
00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:49.590
<v Speaker 1>the amount of willpower it takes to get up off the couch and walk across the</v>

332
00:10:49.591 --> 00:10:50.940
<v Speaker 1>street and do whatever you're going to do,</v>

333
00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:52.780
<v Speaker 1>it requires a hell of a lot more power,</v>

334
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:53.850
<v Speaker 1>more willpower.</v>

335
00:10:53.850 --> 00:10:57.480
<v Speaker 1>Then you would think it would as a healthy person because your cells aren't</v>

336
00:10:57.481 --> 00:10:57.751
<v Speaker 1>working,</v>

337
00:10:57.751 --> 00:10:58.650
<v Speaker 1>you don't have the energy,</v>

338
00:10:58.651 --> 00:11:01.740
<v Speaker 1>and yet you get up and you do it in every step you take is sapping your</v>

339
00:11:01.741 --> 00:11:03.720
<v Speaker 1>willpower in a way a healthy person doesn't have.</v>

340
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.621
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

341
00:11:04.621 --> 00:11:05.370
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying.</v>

342
00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:10.370
<v Speaker 1>So you're saying that even though willpower is sort of an individual</v>

343
00:11:10.681 --> 00:11:12.430
<v Speaker 1>characteristic and some people having,</v>

344
00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:13.290
<v Speaker 1>some people don't.</v>

345
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:14.970
<v Speaker 1>With fat people,</v>

346
00:11:14.971 --> 00:11:17.360
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like a catch 22 because the,</v>

347
00:11:17.361 --> 00:11:19.590
<v Speaker 1>although they need it to drop away,</v>

348
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.100
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to have it because they needed to just move around.</v>

349
00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:27.120
<v Speaker 1>Their energy levels are lower so they have less willpower and they're using the</v>

350
00:11:27.121 --> 00:11:29.880
<v Speaker 1>willpower to do simple things that are effortless for you.</v>

351
00:11:29.881 --> 00:11:31.620
<v Speaker 1>And it's not effortless for a fat person.</v>

352
00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:34.740
<v Speaker 1>That is such an interesting point and one that I really didn't consider.</v>

353
00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:39.690
<v Speaker 1>That's a very unique point because I never really considered that fat people</v>

354
00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:40.390
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

355
00:11:40.390 --> 00:11:42.990
<v Speaker 1>it's almost like they can't help themselves.</v>

356
00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.720
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like there's so we'll,</v>

357
00:11:44.721 --> 00:11:49.400
<v Speaker 1>or it's so much more difficult for them to pass on shitty food than it is a</v>

358
00:11:49.410 --> 00:11:50.220
<v Speaker 1>regular person.</v>

359
00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:50.401
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

360
00:11:50.401 --> 00:11:51.300
<v Speaker 1>think of it like this.</v>

361
00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:51.841
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

362
00:11:51.841 --> 00:11:52.980
<v Speaker 1>If you're a regular person,</v>

363
00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:54.270
<v Speaker 1>that's thin privilege.</v>

364
00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:56.340
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

365
00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:57.970
<v Speaker 1>so people are real people.</v>

366
00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.330
<v Speaker 1>So now it's a trainee thing.</v>

367
00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:02.320
<v Speaker 1>Let's pretend that you're a fat person,</v>

368
00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:02.640
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

369
00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:02.800
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

370
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.150
<v Speaker 1>and we have a Bagel sitting here.</v>

371
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:04.540
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

372
00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:04.841
<v Speaker 1>good luck.</v>

373
00:12:04.841 --> 00:12:05.890
<v Speaker 1>Pretend to bitch.</v>

374
00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:07.173
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

375
00:12:08.050 --> 00:12:08.890
<v Speaker 1>Can't help myself.</v>

376
00:12:09.370 --> 00:12:10.390
<v Speaker 1>So the jokes,</v>

377
00:12:10.391 --> 00:12:13.300
<v Speaker 1>they're the bagels can be talking to you over and over and say,</v>

378
00:12:13.301 --> 00:12:15.340
<v Speaker 1>eat me and it healthy person says,</v>

379
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't actually have a craving like fuck you Bagel.</v>

380
00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

381
00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:19.480
<v Speaker 1>But if you're a tech guy,</v>

382
00:12:19.481 --> 00:12:20.270
<v Speaker 1>I love bagels.</v>

383
00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:21.190
<v Speaker 1>If you're a fat person,</v>

384
00:12:21.191 --> 00:12:23.050
<v Speaker 1>that Bagel is going to constantly sit and go eat me,</v>

385
00:12:23.051 --> 00:12:23.321
<v Speaker 1>eat me,</v>

386
00:12:23.321 --> 00:12:23.621
<v Speaker 1>eat me.</v>

387
00:12:23.621 --> 00:12:25.330
<v Speaker 1>And every time you say it consciously,</v>

388
00:12:25.331 --> 00:12:29.290
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to eat the Bagel you are spending your willpower wantonly so every</v>

389
00:12:29.291 --> 00:12:31.160
<v Speaker 1>time you see an ad for Mars on,</v>

390
00:12:31.161 --> 00:12:34.000
<v Speaker 1>on TV now Mars bars or whatever the heck the latest candy is,</v>

391
00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:34.860
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>

392
00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:35.060
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

393
00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:35.550
<v Speaker 1>I've got to credit.</v>

394
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:36.070
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

395
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:39.700
<v Speaker 1>So you spend your entire day saying no to your biological systems that are</v>

396
00:12:39.701 --> 00:12:41.290
<v Speaker 1>starving for energy.</v>

397
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:44.350
<v Speaker 1>And this is why you're not deplete it.</v>

398
00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.330
<v Speaker 1>You're not lacking willpower.</v>

399
00:12:46.331 --> 00:12:49.570
<v Speaker 1>You're wasting your willpower saying no to foods that are calling out to you and</v>

400
00:12:49.571 --> 00:12:52.510
<v Speaker 1>to biologically unnatural way cause your energy systems are broken,</v>

401
00:12:52.810 --> 00:12:56.320
<v Speaker 1>broken and you have less willpower then you should have had because your cells</v>

402
00:12:56.321 --> 00:12:57.041
<v Speaker 1>aren't functioning right.</v>

403
00:12:57.041 --> 00:12:58.120
<v Speaker 1>Your hormones are broken.</v>

404
00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:01.600
<v Speaker 1>So it never say that fat people are fat.</v>

405
00:13:01.601 --> 00:13:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Because of a lack of willpower.</v>

406
00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:05.950
<v Speaker 1>The fact that they're walking is a testament to their willpower.</v>

407
00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:08.890
<v Speaker 1>What they're lacking is knowledge and they're lacking tools.</v>

408
00:13:08.891 --> 00:13:10.180
<v Speaker 1>And when fat people have those things,</v>

409
00:13:10.210 --> 00:13:12.400
<v Speaker 1>they immediately go and they get thin again.</v>

410
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:12.860
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

411
00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:13.960
<v Speaker 1>But if that's the case,</v>

412
00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:18.880
<v Speaker 1>then what makes someone go out of their way and get that knowledge?</v>

413
00:13:18.881 --> 00:13:20.620
<v Speaker 1>What makes someone changed their diet?</v>

414
00:13:20.650 --> 00:13:23.140
<v Speaker 1>What makes someone make the difficult steps to start going to a gym?</v>

415
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.640
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of willpower.</v>

416
00:13:24.650 --> 00:13:25.483
<v Speaker 1>Dave Asprey.</v>

417
00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:26.440
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

418
00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.390
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely willpower component to it,</v>

419
00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:32.200
<v Speaker 1>but things like social support will increase the amount of willpower you have.</v>

420
00:13:32.201 --> 00:13:35.710
<v Speaker 1>Things like encouragement and also things like like dying or being disabled or</v>

421
00:13:35.711 --> 00:13:38.500
<v Speaker 1>finding a diabetic ulcer on your leg and your doctor telling you you're going to</v>

422
00:13:38.501 --> 00:13:40.210
<v Speaker 1>lose your leg if you don't work your ass out.</v>

423
00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:44.170
<v Speaker 1>That can temporarily increase willpower enough that you get your cell cellular</v>

424
00:13:44.171 --> 00:13:45.040
<v Speaker 1>energy kicked off.</v>

425
00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:45.430
<v Speaker 1>Did.</v>

426
00:13:45.430 --> 00:13:47.330
<v Speaker 1>I was reading a thing the other day,</v>

427
00:13:47.331 --> 00:13:47.691
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

428
00:13:47.691 --> 00:13:51.870
<v Speaker 1>I've been railing on about this lately about the idea of people are,</v>

429
00:13:51.871 --> 00:13:56.830
<v Speaker 1>are going on about what they're calling for fat shaming and fat shaming is</v>

430
00:13:56.831 --> 00:13:59.230
<v Speaker 1>making people feel bad for being overweight.</v>

431
00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:04.440
<v Speaker 1>And I've read this one article where this woman was talking about how she was</v>

432
00:14:04.691 --> 00:14:09.250
<v Speaker 1>being fat shamed because she went to a family function and everyone was gushing</v>

433
00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.360
<v Speaker 1>about her cousin.</v>

434
00:14:10.660 --> 00:14:15.130
<v Speaker 1>Her cousin lost 20 pounds and the that they were making such a big deal out of</v>

435
00:14:15.131 --> 00:14:15.341
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

436
00:14:15.341 --> 00:14:19.840
<v Speaker 1>that it was clear to her that they were judging her for not losing the 20</v>

437
00:14:19.841 --> 00:14:20.141
<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>

438
00:14:20.141 --> 00:14:23.830
<v Speaker 1>So it made her feel awful and she didn't understand how they couldn't understand</v>

439
00:14:23.831 --> 00:14:25.720
<v Speaker 1>that what they were doing was fat shaming her,</v>

440
00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:29.890
<v Speaker 1>complimenting someone on losing weight,</v>

441
00:14:29.891 --> 00:14:33.910
<v Speaker 1>you're fat shaming the person who hasn't lost the weight and that it made her</v>

442
00:14:33.911 --> 00:14:36.700
<v Speaker 1>feel awful and that it was incredibly insensitive of them.</v>

443
00:14:36.701 --> 00:14:37.180
<v Speaker 1>And that,</v>

444
00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:38.013
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

445
00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated by that kind of thinking.</v>

446
00:14:41.141 --> 00:14:41.831
<v Speaker 1>I really am.</v>

447
00:14:41.831 --> 00:14:43.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm fascinated by that sort of like,</v>

448
00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:48.550
<v Speaker 1>like reverse victimology sort of a thing where instead of you being the victim</v>

449
00:14:48.551 --> 00:14:49.720
<v Speaker 1>of your own handiwork,</v>

450
00:14:49.721 --> 00:14:54.721
<v Speaker 1>you become like a persecuted person because they don't accept you for the flaws</v>

451
00:14:55.071 --> 00:14:59.450
<v Speaker 1>that you have or even mentioned the possibility of those flaws existing by</v>

452
00:14:59.451 --> 00:15:03.050
<v Speaker 1>virtue of complimenting someone for having gotten over the same flaws that you</v>

453
00:15:03.051 --> 00:15:03.884
<v Speaker 1>possess.</v>

454
00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:08.920
<v Speaker 1>Polaris think without even knowing the specifics on us on particular issues</v>

455
00:15:08.931 --> 00:15:09.920
<v Speaker 1>anytime somebody is.</v>

456
00:15:09.921 --> 00:15:12.230
<v Speaker 1>So we linked to embrace the victim role.</v>

457
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:12.800
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

458
00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.150
<v Speaker 1>his mouth traveled right away.</v>

459
00:15:14.630 --> 00:15:15.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

460
00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:19.850
<v Speaker 1>do you know there's a reality to losing weight that we have this Dave Asprey guy</v>

461
00:15:19.851 --> 00:15:23.690
<v Speaker 1>who's an expert in a lot of aspects of nutrition.</v>

462
00:15:23.691 --> 00:15:26.540
<v Speaker 1>He's a fascinating guy and one of the things he was talking about where is he</v>

463
00:15:26.541 --> 00:15:29.870
<v Speaker 1>was giving a overweight people a pass because you're saying the level of</v>

464
00:15:29.871 --> 00:15:33.590
<v Speaker 1>addiction that these people actually have for food to say that they don't have</v>

465
00:15:33.591 --> 00:15:37.970
<v Speaker 1>willpower is really unfair because there are so overweight.</v>

466
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:42.230
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of these folks are so far gone that they used up all of their</v>

467
00:15:42.231 --> 00:15:46.700
<v Speaker 1>willpower just to get up in the morning just to walk to the bus stop,</v>

468
00:15:46.701 --> 00:15:47.210
<v Speaker 1>just to go,</v>

469
00:15:47.210 --> 00:15:47.721
<v Speaker 1>go to work,</v>

470
00:15:47.721 --> 00:15:48.620
<v Speaker 1>just to get their,</v>

471
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:49.370
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

472
00:15:49.370 --> 00:15:50.690
<v Speaker 1>their chores done during the day.</v>

473
00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Like they don't have the same level of energy that a healthy person has.</v>

474
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:57.350
<v Speaker 1>So to tribute them to having like this,</v>

475
00:15:57.590 --> 00:16:02.330
<v Speaker 1>there's this like backlog of energy than not tapping into because they're weak</v>

476
00:16:02.331 --> 00:16:02.930
<v Speaker 1>willed.</v>

477
00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:04.250
<v Speaker 1>It's not that like they're,</v>

478
00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:06.020
<v Speaker 1>they're already so far in the hole,</v>

479
00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:08.720
<v Speaker 1>it's almost impossible for them to get motivation.</v>

480
00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:12.020
<v Speaker 1>They have to get something like incredibly extreme has to happen to them.</v>

481
00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.800
<v Speaker 1>And I thought that was really unique and and looking at it that way I people to,</v>

482
00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:16.540
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

483
00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:17.300
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

484
00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:18.111
<v Speaker 1>People out of shape.</v>

485
00:16:18.111 --> 00:16:18.944
<v Speaker 1>People who are depressed,</v>

486
00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:22.460
<v Speaker 1>you could see the in with people that are ruining their life too,</v>

487
00:16:22.461 --> 00:16:23.750
<v Speaker 1>whether it's through addictions,</v>

488
00:16:23.751 --> 00:16:23.931
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

489
00:16:23.931 --> 00:16:25.040
<v Speaker 1>you see that as well.</v>

490
00:16:25.041 --> 00:16:27.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like why can't they see it the way other people see it?</v>

491
00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:29.180
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like they can't,</v>

492
00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:32.480
<v Speaker 1>like they're so trapped up in the momentum of whatever it is.</v>

493
00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:34.040
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's gambling or food.</v>

494
00:16:34.250 --> 00:16:34.431
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

495
00:16:34.431 --> 00:16:37.940
<v Speaker 1>I've seen people with food addictions that you can watch the gears spinning in</v>

496
00:16:37.941 --> 00:16:39.500
<v Speaker 1>their mind when food is near my,</v>

497
00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:41.720
<v Speaker 1>like they know they're supposed to lose weight and they know they're not</v>

498
00:16:41.721 --> 00:16:42.554
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be eating it,</v>

499
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:46.340
<v Speaker 1>but the the gears start spinning in their mind and that becomes the primary</v>

500
00:16:46.341 --> 00:16:47.570
<v Speaker 1>focus of their existence.</v>

501
00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:48.910
<v Speaker 1>Get that fucking doughnut.</v>

502
00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:49.840
<v Speaker 1>I need that donut.</v>

503
00:16:50.070 --> 00:16:51.440
<v Speaker 1>That donut is huge.</v>

504
00:16:51.740 --> 00:16:51.961
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

505
00:16:51.961 --> 00:16:52.191
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

506
00:16:52.191 --> 00:16:56.660
<v Speaker 1>it's critical for fueling whenever whatever it trouble is going on in their mind</v>

507
00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:02.060
<v Speaker 1>and it's a weird aspect of human beings and you don't do that any favors by</v>

508
00:17:02.061 --> 00:17:07.061
<v Speaker 1>pretending that encouraging someone who lost weight is a bad thing.</v>

509
00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:11.420
<v Speaker 1>The idea that socially that's irresponsible because you're fat and you're near</v>

510
00:17:11.421 --> 00:17:11.900
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

511
00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:12.141
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

512
00:17:12.141 --> 00:17:15.050
<v Speaker 1>it's actually responsible because that terrible feeling that you have,</v>

513
00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:19.970
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to be the bump that pushes you towards eating a salad instead of a</v>

514
00:17:19.971 --> 00:17:23.720
<v Speaker 1>cheeseburger should be the bump that makes you write down everything you eat</v>

515
00:17:23.721 --> 00:17:25.490
<v Speaker 1>that day and state some goals.</v>

516
00:17:25.580 --> 00:17:26.480
<v Speaker 1>This is what I'm going to do.</v>

517
00:17:26.481 --> 00:17:29.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to use my willpower to overcome this horrible obsession that I have.</v>

518
00:17:29.991 --> 00:17:30.824
<v Speaker 1>Was shitty food.</v>

519
00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:32.540
<v Speaker 1>That's also possible.</v>

520
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:33.660
<v Speaker 1>It's also possible by,</v>

521
00:17:33.661 --> 00:17:38.090
<v Speaker 1>by you going home and blaming everybody in the blog that you've projected</v>

522
00:17:38.091 --> 00:17:41.510
<v Speaker 1>yourself away from any potential benefit from having these bad feelings.</v>

523
00:17:41.511 --> 00:17:41.841
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

524
00:17:41.841 --> 00:17:42.760
<v Speaker 1>he's the same as the amount.</v>

525
00:17:42.761 --> 00:17:45.680
<v Speaker 1>The competition is somebody who never learned how to lose,</v>

526
00:17:45.710 --> 00:17:49.220
<v Speaker 1>and the same in a avoiding criticism like you gotta you gotta look it.</v>

527
00:17:49.221 --> 00:17:49.410
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>

528
00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:50.310
<v Speaker 1>it feels like shit,</v>

529
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:52.020
<v Speaker 2>but that feel like shit.</v>

530
00:17:52.050 --> 00:17:53.970
<v Speaker 2>Correct it so it doesn't feel like shit anymore.</v>
