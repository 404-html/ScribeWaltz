1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Here we go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>baby,</v>

2
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:02.520
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

3
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:03.570
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

4
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.090
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

5
00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.700
<v Speaker 1>and that can be only one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Avant.</v>

6
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.350
<v Speaker 1>Well far as we know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>far as I know in the universe.</v>

7
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.460
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what they think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you know that the concept of</v>

8
00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:17.820
<v Speaker 1>infinity apparently as explained to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people far smarter than us,</v>

9
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.240
<v Speaker 1>is that the universe is so big that not</v>
<v Speaker 1>only is there intelligent life out there</v>

10
00:00:24.151 --> 00:00:27.930
<v Speaker 1>for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's humans out there for sure</v>

11
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.710
<v Speaker 1>and infinity is so big that that means</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere in the universe there is</v>

12
00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:40.530
<v Speaker 1>another Theo Vaughn that has done</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly the same things that you've</v>

13
00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:43.140
<v Speaker 1>done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said exactly the same things that you've</v>

14
00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:45.630
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>been in the same conversations that</v>

15
00:00:45.631 --> 00:00:50.370
<v Speaker 1>you've been in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>down to that pause down to the</v>

16
00:00:50.371 --> 00:00:53.850
<v Speaker 1>millisecond,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an infinite number of times,</v>

17
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.170
<v Speaker 1>and you believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

18
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Not just one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just one time,</v>

19
00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.130
<v Speaker 1>but an unending number of times because</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how big infinity is.</v>

20
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.370
<v Speaker 1>You're not buying it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll bet infinity smaller than the.</v>

21
00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.610
<v Speaker 1>If I had a bet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

22
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.350
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think that that could for</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

23
00:01:10.351 --> 00:01:12.930
<v Speaker 1>that couldn't for me if I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I knew that that was true,</v>

24
00:01:12.931 --> 00:01:14.490
<v Speaker 1>that would just break my heart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like,</v>

25
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.920
<v Speaker 1>because then you would feel like</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything you're doing feels pointless,</v>

26
00:01:16.921 --> 00:01:18.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but isn't it anyway?</v>

27
00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.770
<v Speaker 1>Just what you know about the universe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just say the universe was limited</v>

28
00:01:22.771 --> 00:01:24.520
<v Speaker 1>to the size of this galaxy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

29
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which it really could be.</v>

30
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.391
<v Speaker 1>Could be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

31
00:01:27.391 --> 00:01:28.830
<v Speaker 1>would you and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's be honest,</v>

32
00:01:28.831 --> 00:01:30.010
<v Speaker 1>we're kind of dumb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

33
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.600
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're failing.</v>

34
00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just guessing.</v>

35
00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.180
<v Speaker 1>Guess total guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

36
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.800
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll say some big words every now and</v>

37
00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:36.840
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is I learned those big</v>

38
00:01:36.841 --> 00:01:39.450
<v Speaker 1>words from people that actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand them and I'm just repeating</v>

39
00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:42.940
<v Speaker 1>the noises that they say</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

40
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.100
<v Speaker 1>So tomorrow I'm the last person that</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks I'm smart.</v>

41
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.851
<v Speaker 1>Trust me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

42
00:01:47.851 --> 00:01:48.810
<v Speaker 1>We're all mimics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

43
00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.970
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you look at,</v>

44
00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.500
<v Speaker 1>I think they think there are hundreds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>billions of stars in this galaxy.</v>

45
00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.940
<v Speaker 1>Just that alone is too big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Too Big,</v>

46
00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.590
<v Speaker 1>too big for you to wrap your head</v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

47
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.290
<v Speaker 1>It's too big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no one.</v>

48
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.130
<v Speaker 1>When you think about like how big that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

49
00:02:05.131 --> 00:02:06.690
<v Speaker 1>like there's no way you really think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

50
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:07.890
<v Speaker 1>you just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just kind of like,</v>

51
00:02:07.891 --> 00:02:08.724
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

52
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:13.730
<v Speaker 1>big now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now think of infinite and so hundreds of</v>

53
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.430
<v Speaker 1>billions of those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they think it's possible that</v>

54
00:02:17.431 --> 00:02:22.431
<v Speaker 1>inside each galaxy they know that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>center of each galaxy has a supermassive</v>

55
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.820
<v Speaker 1>black hole in it and they think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside that supermassive black hole</v>

56
00:02:26.821 --> 00:02:30.690
<v Speaker 1>might be a whole nother universe filled</v>
<v Speaker 1>with galaxies.</v>

57
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.300
<v Speaker 1>Each of them that have supermassive</v>
<v Speaker 1>black holes in the center.</v>

58
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.340
<v Speaker 1>You go through one of those nother</v>
<v Speaker 1>universe,</v>

59
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.910
<v Speaker 1>infinite universes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so infinite infinities.</v>

60
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.080
<v Speaker 1>So the universe is infinite and there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>infinite numbers of universes.</v>

61
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.180
<v Speaker 1>So somewhere out there there's another</v>
<v Speaker 1>theo on same haircut,</v>

62
00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.970
<v Speaker 1>same jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same style.</v>

63
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.930
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

64
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.350
<v Speaker 1>Same back problem killing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It did a scary.</v>

65
00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:57.440
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that makes the job.</v>

66
00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.250
<v Speaker 1>I took this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems so much shorter.</v>

67
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>If the.</v>

68
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 2>If the universe is that much bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it could be that big.</v>

69
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.180
<v Speaker 2>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did he show me?</v>

70
00:03:04.181 --> 00:03:06.970
<v Speaker 2>Your Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that simulation on the inside of</v>

71
00:03:06.971 --> 00:03:09.030
<v Speaker 2>a black hole with design movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bro,</v>

72
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 2>that it was just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just animation,</v>

73
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.900
<v Speaker 2>so the idea is you go through the black</v>
<v Speaker 2>hole and you wake up again,</v>

74
00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.040
<v Speaker 2>a baby and Louisiana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>America you mama's cuddling.</v>

75
00:03:21.041 --> 00:03:25.870
<v Speaker 2>You owe you such a sweet thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Birds Chirping,</v>

76
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.830
<v Speaker 2>but they're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're chirping 200 trillion light</v>

77
00:03:29.831 --> 00:03:31.510
<v Speaker 2>years away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

78
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.860
<v Speaker 2>You believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe is a weird word.</v>

79
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.530
<v Speaker 2>Do you seal it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too big.</v>

80
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.720
<v Speaker 2>I don't even feel son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The son.</v>

81
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:41.890
<v Speaker 2>I go outside and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

82
00:03:41.891 --> 00:03:44.020
<v Speaker 2>it's warm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't feel that there's a thing</v>

83
00:03:44.021 --> 00:03:47.470
<v Speaker 2>that's a million times bigger than earth</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's floating in the sky.</v>

84
00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.820
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel that.</v>

85
00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.940
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hard part for me is when they say</v>

86
00:03:51.941 --> 00:03:54.700
<v Speaker 2>that the universe keeps expanding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

87
00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like something a child would</v>

88
00:03:56.591 --> 00:03:59.440
<v Speaker 2>say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That part sounds to me like it just</v>

89
00:03:59.441 --> 00:04:01.270
<v Speaker 2>keeps growing and growing and growing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and growing.</v>

90
00:04:01.271 --> 00:04:01.871
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

91
00:04:01.871 --> 00:04:04.590
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like something like my four</v>
<v Speaker 2>year old nephew would say if like he</v>

92
00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.070
<v Speaker 2>won't go to sleep at night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

93
00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real one is the birth of the</v>

94
00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:09.430
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the real one,</v>

95
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.580
<v Speaker 2>like the big bang.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So before the Big Bang,</v>

96
00:04:12.581 --> 00:04:14.560
<v Speaker 2>the universe was smaller than the head</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a pin,</v>

97
00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.360
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

98
00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.640
<v Speaker 2>And then for some reason,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

99
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.960
<v Speaker 2>they don't know why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in one instant the universe created</v>

100
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.480
<v Speaker 2>seemed farfetched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's what the scientists believe.</v>

101
00:04:29.661 --> 00:04:33.100
<v Speaker 2>Forget about what religious people</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe or cult leaders believe,</v>

102
00:04:33.101 --> 00:04:38.101
<v Speaker 2>or schizophrenia x the logit of legit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Sean Carol's of the world,</v>

103
00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:43.600
<v Speaker 2>the Neil degrasse Tyson's of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real scientists that can hit you</v>

104
00:04:43.601 --> 00:04:46.000
<v Speaker 2>with the real words and they actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand them.</v>

105
00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.280
<v Speaker 2>The smartest people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real smart people.</v>

106
00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:50.340
<v Speaker 2>They actually think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hmm.</v>

107
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.453
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?</v>

108
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.060
<v Speaker 2>I think the jury's out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I think.</v>

109
00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:59.920
<v Speaker 2>Then I think I'm still kind of feeling</v>
<v Speaker 2>it out,</v>

110
00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:02.980
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that I think I could easily get</v>

111
00:05:02.981 --> 00:05:05.980
<v Speaker 2>sucked in if I'm not careful to just</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe in.</v>

112
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.950
<v Speaker 2>I just wonder if some of their stuff is</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

113
00:05:08.951 --> 00:05:10.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what if the building blocks that we</v>

114
00:05:10.901 --> 00:05:13.960
<v Speaker 2>started with aren't really correct,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

115
00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:16.840
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes I feel like they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the science for me,</v>

116
00:05:16.841 --> 00:05:21.820
<v Speaker 2>it takes too much of the hope out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I guess I want to Romanticize the</v>

117
00:05:21.821 --> 00:05:25.420
<v Speaker 2>universe a little bit and I want it to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be a little more fantastical.</v>

118
00:05:25.421 --> 00:05:27.270
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe we get out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

119
00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.260
<v Speaker 2>in the secret of that video and there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a couple,</v>

120
00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.080
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>angels out there or a band or something</v>

121
00:05:32.081 --> 00:05:33.910
<v Speaker 2>or like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

122
00:05:33.911 --> 00:05:35.710
<v Speaker 2>some angels are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

123
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of something more exciting</v>

124
00:05:39.041 --> 00:05:41.530
<v Speaker 2>than just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that exciting or is that just more</v>

125
00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.560
<v Speaker 2>human like angels and a band.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

126
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.660
<v Speaker 2>That's like human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'd actually be boring.</v>

127
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's just me.</v>

128
00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.530
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'm afraid to go into that other</v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

129
00:05:50.531 --> 00:05:52.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>into that other realm.</v>

130
00:05:52.031 --> 00:05:54.760
<v Speaker 2>Like if somebody was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go in there and they were trying to push</v>

131
00:05:54.761 --> 00:05:57.410
<v Speaker 2>me in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say I'm not going in there.</v>

132
00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever</v>

133
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.840
<v Speaker 1>been in a place where you're in a or</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're outside at night?</v>

134
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:06.470
<v Speaker 1>There's no clouds and there's no light</v>
<v Speaker 1>pollution and you could see the Milky</v>

135
00:06:06.471 --> 00:06:08.230
<v Speaker 1>Way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arizona Tucson.</v>

136
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:09.863
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

137
00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird feeling.</v>

138
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.190
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The all those stars and you're like,</v>

139
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.800
<v Speaker 1>is this up here all the time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

140
00:06:15.801 --> 00:06:17.630
<v Speaker 1>That's how I feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel like.</v>

141
00:06:17.631 --> 00:06:19.640
<v Speaker 1>Is this out here all the time and what</v>
<v Speaker 1>have I been doing?</v>

142
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we're fucking ourselves up</v>

143
00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:23.450
<v Speaker 1>cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been saying that forever.</v>

144
00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:27.740
<v Speaker 1>I think all that light from cities</v>
<v Speaker 1>blocking out all those stars.</v>

145
00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:31.090
<v Speaker 1>I think it confuses us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't,</v>

146
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:35.600
<v Speaker 1>we don't realize what we're in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are in this crazy space ride.</v>

147
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:38.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people forget about that a lot</v>

148
00:06:38.331 --> 00:06:38.980
<v Speaker 1>of times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

149
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.580
<v Speaker 1>we definitely get caught up in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>minutia.</v>

150
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:44.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what's out there in the world and</v>

151
00:06:44.091 --> 00:06:44.960
<v Speaker 1>the universe.</v>

152
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:47.960
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if something were out there,</v>

153
00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:51.410
<v Speaker 1>it would have stopped by now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know about that.</v>

154
00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.340
<v Speaker 1>It's been a lot of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of space on a space that has</v>

155
00:06:55.341 --> 00:06:58.400
<v Speaker 1>to go through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that things get so smart that</v>

156
00:06:58.401 --> 00:07:00.350
<v Speaker 1>they don't do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I think.</v>

157
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:03.080
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that this whole idea about space</v>

158
00:07:03.081 --> 00:07:05.600
<v Speaker 1>travel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they do that after awhile.</v>

159
00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:09.730
<v Speaker 1>I think they get so fucking smart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they become symbiotic with machines and</v>

160
00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.200
<v Speaker 1>I think artificial life and artificial</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence,</v>

161
00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.620
<v Speaker 1>they create their own reality and</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally create their own universes.</v>

162
00:07:15.621 --> 00:07:17.750
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they bothered traveling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

163
00:07:17.751 --> 00:07:19.430
<v Speaker 1>they're just thinking it up and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>

164
00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:21.370
<v Speaker 1>I think they make things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

165
00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:24.680
<v Speaker 1>I think when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is just a thought,</v>

166
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.450
<v Speaker 1>but I think what's going to happen with</v>
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

167
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:27.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd take little trips,</v>

168
00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:29.570
<v Speaker 1>send a rover to Mars and shit.</v>

169
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:33.080
<v Speaker 1>Then we sent probes into space Florida</v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere.</v>

170
00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:34.820
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go local,</v>

171
00:07:34.821 --> 00:07:37.730
<v Speaker 1>anything know it can be a big adventure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

172
00:07:37.731 --> 00:07:39.680
<v Speaker 1>we'd go out to the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went to the moon a couple of times,</v>

173
00:07:39.681 --> 00:07:40.600
<v Speaker 1>supposedly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

174
00:07:40.790 --> 00:07:42.050
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what we don't do,</v>

175
00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:42.850
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

176
00:07:42.850 --> 00:07:44.900
<v Speaker 1>what we're doing with these little tiny</v>
<v Speaker 1>trips,</v>

177
00:07:44.901 --> 00:07:47.870
<v Speaker 1>it's all fairly close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all inside of our solar system,</v>

178
00:07:47.871 --> 00:07:48.704
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

179
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:51.560
<v Speaker 1>What we're saying is that someone is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going way,</v>

180
00:07:51.561 --> 00:07:52.820
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way further than that,</v>

181
00:07:52.821 --> 00:07:54.740
<v Speaker 1>so they would have to be way more</v>
<v Speaker 1>advanced than that.</v>

182
00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:58.550
<v Speaker 1>What I look at us and I look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>artificial life and artificial</v>

183
00:07:58.551 --> 00:08:01.400
<v Speaker 1>intelligence and how close we are to</v>
<v Speaker 1>creating something that's smarter than</v>

184
00:08:01.401 --> 00:08:04.640
<v Speaker 1>us within the next hundred years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have some form of</v>

185
00:08:04.641 --> 00:08:09.200
<v Speaker 1>artificial life that's probably way</v>
<v Speaker 1>smarter than us and it's gonna create</v>

186
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:11.450
<v Speaker 1>even better versions of artificial life.</v>

187
00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:16.430
<v Speaker 1>It's going to improve upon the design</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's going to be things that</v>

188
00:08:16.431 --> 00:08:19.880
<v Speaker 1>they can do in terms of like recreating</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality in your own mind,</v>

189
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.670
<v Speaker 1>like sit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and I sitting across from each</v>

190
00:08:22.671 --> 00:08:25.790
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're experiencing this table.</v>

191
00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.160
<v Speaker 1>We're experienced in looking at each</v>
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>

192
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.500
<v Speaker 1>We're friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a history together.</v>

193
00:08:30.501 --> 00:08:34.190
<v Speaker 1>We talk a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we were used to being in each other's</v>

194
00:08:34.191 --> 00:08:36.830
<v Speaker 1>presence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's all these feelings and thinking</v>

195
00:08:36.831 --> 00:08:38.990
<v Speaker 1>and thoughts going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're gonna be able to</v>

196
00:08:38.991 --> 00:08:41.450
<v Speaker 1>recreate that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're going to recreate that</v>

197
00:08:41.451 --> 00:08:44.300
<v Speaker 1>in a way that's indistinguishable from</v>
<v Speaker 1>this moment that we're experiencing</v>

198
00:08:44.301 --> 00:08:45.860
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then,</v>

199
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're human just going to become</v>

200
00:08:47.901 --> 00:08:49.040
<v Speaker 1>obsolete then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

201
00:08:49.041 --> 00:08:50.660
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

202
00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.660
<v Speaker 1>Well Dang it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dang it.</v>

203
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:55.290
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

204
00:08:55.291 --> 00:08:56.124
<v Speaker 1>if you go back,</v>

205
00:08:56.370 --> 00:09:00.210
<v Speaker 2>go back to single cell organisms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go back to second Amoeba or something,</v>

206
00:09:00.211 --> 00:09:02.110
<v Speaker 2>the first time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>single celled organisms as became</v>

207
00:09:02.111 --> 00:09:04.190
<v Speaker 2>multicell Logan's Bulgur and one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

208
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.910
<v Speaker 2>How many of them were hanging back?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No Man,</v>

209
00:09:05.911 --> 00:09:07.650
<v Speaker 2>fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to live in the woods.</v>

210
00:09:07.651 --> 00:09:12.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to stay single cells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Single cells way to go sell stuff is</v>

211
00:09:12.421 --> 00:09:13.950
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to see things,</v>

212
00:09:13.951 --> 00:09:14.970
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck you.</v>

213
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:18.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't need a phone motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a single cell organisms.</v>

214
00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:23.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

215
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:25.720
<v Speaker 2>things don't have to get any better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

216
00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:26.820
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this.</v>

217
00:09:26.821 --> 00:09:28.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to get a job and be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>hitman.</v>

218
00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:31.570
<v Speaker 2>So if you looked at single celled</v>
<v Speaker 2>organism,</v>

219
00:09:31.571 --> 00:09:34.110
<v Speaker 2>they eventually became Theo Vaughn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

220
00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:37.770
<v Speaker 2>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a complicated leap from single</v>

221
00:09:37.771 --> 00:09:41.310
<v Speaker 2>celled organisms from billions of years</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago to Theo von Holy Shit.</v>

222
00:09:41.311 --> 00:09:43.590
<v Speaker 2>Is that a leap to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a human.</v>

223
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:46.230
<v Speaker 2>That's a big leap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're saying it would be crazy for</v>

224
00:09:46.231 --> 00:09:48.030
<v Speaker 2>us if we didn't continue to move</v>
<v Speaker 2>forward.</v>

225
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:49.410
<v Speaker 2>We're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>

226
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.780
<v Speaker 2>It's going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything does.</v>

227
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:53.520
<v Speaker 2>We're gonna improve upon this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

228
00:09:53.521 --> 00:09:56.130
<v Speaker 2>we're different now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People are bigger and stronger and</v>

229
00:09:56.131 --> 00:09:58.920
<v Speaker 2>faster than they were just 100 years ago</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the nutrition,</v>

230
00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.860
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those genes now was saying that the</v>

231
00:10:01.861 --> 00:10:06.330
<v Speaker 2>genes that people who exercise and are</v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy are better than the genes of</v>

232
00:10:06.331 --> 00:10:10.410
<v Speaker 2>people that don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You literally can transfer some of those</v>

233
00:10:10.411 --> 00:10:13.620
<v Speaker 2>traits and some of that potential into</v>

<v Speaker 2>He's like a jack.</v>

251
00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:51.390
<v Speaker 2>He's like a deaf deaf Jack Russell</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a deaf Jack Russell,</v>

260
00:11:04.021 --> 00:11:07.440
<v Speaker 2>you can't say you can't get them back in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the car.</v>

261
00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:10.610
<v Speaker 2>Like you're sitting there honking the</v>

263
00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:19.470
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

264
00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:20.304
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

265
00:11:20.310 --> 00:11:22.800
<v Speaker 2>Jack Russell terrier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is hilarious.</v>

266
00:11:22.801 --> 00:11:25.350
<v Speaker 2>Extravagant did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means extravagant.</v>

267
00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:29.280
<v Speaker 2>He's so motivated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He loves conspiracies more than anybody</v>

268
00:11:29.281 --> 00:11:31.320
<v Speaker 2>I've ever met in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he thinks everything is a</v>

269
00:11:31.321 --> 00:11:32.670
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

270
00:11:32.671 --> 00:11:33.121
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

271
00:11:33.121 --> 00:11:33.954
<v Speaker 2>he definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

272
00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:35.820
<v Speaker 2>But then he gets into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

273
00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:38.430
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was fascinating to me how he went</v>

274
00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:42.090
<v Speaker 2>from this like one genre of life to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>next and created a business in each one</v>

275
00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.190
<v Speaker 2>and kept moving forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A business.</v>

276
00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:44.971
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got like,</v>

277
00:11:44.971 --> 00:11:46.230
<v Speaker 2>he was amused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He liked music.</v>

278
00:11:46.231 --> 00:11:47.820
<v Speaker 2>He started a band,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

279
00:11:47.821 --> 00:11:50.340
<v Speaker 2>he liked a karate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He started doing,</v>

280
00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:52.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He liked,</v>

282
00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.510

<v Speaker 1>A couple of other businesses.</v>

284
00:11:57.641 --> 00:11:59.200
<v Speaker 1>I think he got into a couple of other</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

285
00:11:59.201 --> 00:12:03.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the other two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lost me a chapter 70,</v>

286
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:06.070
<v Speaker 1>but he'll hit you with too much</v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

287
00:12:06.071 --> 00:12:07.010
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

292
00:12:14.351 --> 00:12:17.010
<v Speaker 1>The other night to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sends a couple of links.</v>

293
00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:21.490
<v Speaker 1>You got to shut your phone off at a</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends with Eddie on was 1:00 AM phone</v>

294
00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:23.680
<v Speaker 1>calls coming in that spot because you</v>
<v Speaker 1>will get,</v>

295
00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:28.150
<v Speaker 1>you will get a wall of text explaining</v>
<v Speaker 1>which youtube video has the right</v>

296
00:12:28.151 --> 00:12:30.610
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which one is set up by the CIA.</v>

297
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.910
<v Speaker 1>It used to be like stopping at a rest</v>
<v Speaker 1>area on the interstate.</v>

298
00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.180
<v Speaker 1>That was like the old Eddie Bravo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd stopped there and next thing you</v>

299
00:12:37.181 --> 00:12:38.530
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd hear the craziest shit in the</v>

300
00:12:38.531 --> 00:12:39.390
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

301
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:44.470
<v Speaker 1>He used to be playing in the background.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he loves all of it.</v>

302
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:45.540
<v Speaker 1>He loves it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's.</v>

303
00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:47.110
<v Speaker 1>He gets out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes in phases,</v>

304
00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:50.830
<v Speaker 1>like he gets out of them for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he was really into chem trails for</v>

305
00:12:50.831 --> 00:12:52.630
<v Speaker 1>awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>

306
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:55.150
<v Speaker 1>I know he probably won't admit it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's pretty obvious.</v>

307
00:12:55.151 --> 00:12:57.550
<v Speaker 1>Chem trails are bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking obvious.</v>

308
00:12:57.850 --> 00:12:59.500
<v Speaker 1>It's just writing because they can write</v>
<v Speaker 1>birthday,</v>

309
00:12:59.501 --> 00:13:01.930
<v Speaker 1>they can write happy birthday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rhonda or something and that's not.</v>

310
00:13:02.650 --> 00:13:05.830
<v Speaker 1>That just seems like it's smoke</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody's birthday that I think when</v>

311
00:13:05.831 --> 00:13:08.260
<v Speaker 1>they do that they're doing that on</v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose,</v>

312
00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:11.230
<v Speaker 1>but the chem trail things just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just nonsense.</v>

313
00:13:11.231 --> 00:13:13.660
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is some evidence that they have</v>

314
00:13:13.661 --> 00:13:17.410
<v Speaker 1>experimented with spraying stuff in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sky and they definitely seed clouds and</v>

315
00:13:17.411 --> 00:13:19.540
<v Speaker 1>certain parts of the world in certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of the country.</v>

316
00:13:19.810 --> 00:13:23.530
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can make it rain like a in Abu</v>

317
00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:24.070
<v Speaker 1>Dhabi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

318
00:13:24.070 --> 00:13:26.080
<v Speaker 1>Where they make it rain once a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

319
00:13:26.110 --> 00:13:27.120
<v Speaker 1>Once a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's there.</v>

320
00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.710
<v Speaker 1>They live in the desert jets up there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

321
00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:33.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They send jets and I think they use</v>

322
00:13:34.210 --> 00:13:36.640
<v Speaker 1>something silver iodine or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

323
00:13:36.641 --> 00:13:39.280
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those pilots,</v>

324
00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:43.780
<v Speaker 1>they spray into the clouds and somehow</v>
<v Speaker 1>or another it makes it rain.</v>

325
00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:47.470
<v Speaker 1>He know when Eddie came,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was talking to him with any one</v>

326
00:13:47.471 --> 00:13:51.220
<v Speaker 1>thing I was thinking about was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think that there are aliens?</v>

327
00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:53.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think that robots will get so</v>

328
00:13:53.861 --> 00:13:58.861
<v Speaker 1>advanced that they will like become</v>
<v Speaker 1>aware and what does he say?</v>

329
00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:03.160
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what he said.</v>

330
00:14:03.161 --> 00:14:06.280
<v Speaker 1>I guess I'm asking you because he went</v>
<v Speaker 1>off on something else and he didn't</v>

331
00:14:06.281 --> 00:14:07.510
<v Speaker 1>really answer it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

332
00:14:07.511 --> 00:14:09.520
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't get too much into artificial</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence.</v>

333
00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:12.160
<v Speaker 1>He's more into like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the FBI tried to fuck us over.</v>

334
00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:13.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well he told me in the bathroom after we</v>

335
00:14:13.931 --> 00:14:15.640
<v Speaker 1>talked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no joke.</v>

336
00:14:15.641 --> 00:14:19.810
<v Speaker 1>He said he had to be a little bit quiet</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he thinks that some people could</v>

337
00:14:19.811 --> 00:14:21.790
<v Speaker 1>be looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

338
00:14:21.791 --> 00:14:23.990
<v Speaker 1>that's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was crazy.</v>

339
00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:25.950
<v Speaker 1>He said that all hush hush about the</v>
<v Speaker 1>urinals.</v>

340
00:14:25.970 --> 00:14:27.730
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He thought that the government got to me</v>

341
00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:31.600
<v Speaker 1>really because I wasn't in chem trails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chem trails would did it.</v>

342
00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:32.201
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just got.</v>

343
00:14:32.201 --> 00:14:34.270
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be a reason here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they do anything to you?</v>

344
00:14:34.271 --> 00:14:35.530
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

345
00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.130
<v Speaker 1>You swear?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I swear no one's talked to me about</v>

346
00:14:39.131 --> 00:14:41.230
<v Speaker 1>anything ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one said,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

350
00:14:49.541 --> 00:14:51.230
<v Speaker 1>I manage this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you showing me,</v>

351
00:14:51.231 --> 00:14:53.390
<v Speaker 1>Jamie?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the article about the cloud</v>

352
00:14:53.391 --> 00:14:56.780
<v Speaker 1>seeding and Abu Dhabi that they use</v>
<v Speaker 1>high.</v>

353
00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:58.070
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>

354
00:14:58.071 --> 00:15:03.071
<v Speaker 1>Grows scopic salt to level up the amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>of amount of moisture to generate more</v>

355
00:15:05.031 --> 00:15:06.290
<v Speaker 1>rain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

356
00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:08.780
<v Speaker 1>I could see him doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dr Habib.</v>

357
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:11.990
<v Speaker 1>Adding that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best season for seeding is between</v>

358
00:15:11.991 --> 00:15:13.310
<v Speaker 1>June and August.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

359
00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:16.050
<v Speaker 1>Hm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean there's,</v>

360
00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:18.110
<v Speaker 1>there's solid up into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

361
00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:22.460
<v Speaker 1>they spray shit and it makes it rain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find that the moon state,</v>

362
00:15:22.461 --> 00:15:23.750
<v Speaker 1>we went to the moon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the moon send makes sense.</v>

363
00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:25.850
<v Speaker 1>Delta could get to if you really think</v>
<v Speaker 1>about it,</v>

364
00:15:26.010 --> 00:15:29.380
<v Speaker 1>like you know what I'm saying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>airlines like southwest though,</v>

365
00:15:29.390 --> 00:15:31.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm a little shaky,</v>

366
00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:34.660
<v Speaker 1>a little bit shaky on there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the people are and they're</v>

367
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:35.730
<v Speaker 1>wearing shorts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

368
00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:39.200
<v Speaker 1>you get on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't trust anybody in his shorts,</v>

369
00:15:39.201 --> 00:15:41.330
<v Speaker 1>especially at church,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

370
00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:44.630
<v Speaker 1>I'll say this when you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

371
00:15:44.631 --> 00:15:46.520
<v Speaker 1>We've been flying across America for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

372
00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.050
<v Speaker 1>40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 years now,</v>

373
00:15:48.051 --> 00:15:49.100
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

374
00:15:49.101 --> 00:15:50.420
<v Speaker 1>Even more maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

375
00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:54.980
<v Speaker 1>and it seems like it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could figure out how to get into</v>

376
00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:58.790
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's harder than that for sure.</v>

377
00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:00.170
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 260,</v>

378
00:16:00.171 --> 00:16:01.580
<v Speaker 1>2000 miles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

379
00:16:01.581 --> 00:16:06.260
<v Speaker 1>the earth is 24,000 miles around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so a full trip from right here.</v>

380
00:16:06.261 --> 00:16:11.090
<v Speaker 1>So you start in Calabasas and you do a</v>
<v Speaker 1>full trip all the way around the planet</v>

381
00:16:11.091 --> 00:16:14.900
<v Speaker 1>and land in Calabasas that's 24,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>miles.</v>

382
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:17.270
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like 12 times at or something.</v>

383
00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like that.</v>

384
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:23.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could do that was we</v>

385
00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.320
<v Speaker 1>these we shit.</v>

386
00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.380
<v Speaker 1>It's hard bed and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no air.</v>

387
00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:37.220
<v Speaker 1>It's one six earth's gravity because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with all sorts of</v>

388
00:16:37.221 --> 00:16:41.540
<v Speaker 1>problems in terms of solar flares and</v>
<v Speaker 1>radiation were protected by the</v>

389
00:16:41.541 --> 00:16:45.290
<v Speaker 1>magnetosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were protected by the radiation belts</v>

390
00:16:45.291 --> 00:16:47.360
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the,</v>

391
00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:50.510
<v Speaker 1>the atmosphere of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you go through that and you go out</v>

392
00:16:50.511 --> 00:16:52.190
<v Speaker 1>into the space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not protected by shit.</v>

393
00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:53.820
<v Speaker 1>We couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>

394
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:56.510
<v Speaker 1>I think we can fight that man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

395
00:16:56.540 --> 00:16:59.660
<v Speaker 1>it can be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem was with biological life.</v>

396
00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.010
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that made it so</v>

397
00:17:01.011 --> 00:17:03.770
<v Speaker 1>interesting about the moon hoax there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly for me,</v>

398
00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:07.880
<v Speaker 1>so it never sent anything alive in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>space and had to come back alive ever.</v>

399
00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:11.540
<v Speaker 1>They never said they never even sent a</v>
<v Speaker 1>chicken in the space and had to come</v>

400
00:17:11.541 --> 00:17:12.800
<v Speaker 1>back a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It all dies.</v>

401
00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:14.060
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just do it with people.</v>

402
00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:17.630
<v Speaker 1>They've only done it with peep a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've never made something.</v>

403
00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.630
<v Speaker 1>They never shot a monkey in a space and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then brought it back alive.</v>

404
00:17:20.631 --> 00:17:22.400
<v Speaker 1>So that's why you think it could be</v>
<v Speaker 1>fictional?</v>

405
00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:25.430
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the only one reason why it was</v>

406
00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:28.490
<v Speaker 1>enticing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the big reasons was the Fox</v>

407
00:17:28.491 --> 00:17:30.770
<v Speaker 1>documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a fox documentary that aired</v>

408
00:17:30.771 --> 00:17:33.080
<v Speaker 1>on tv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was in the nineties.</v>

409
00:17:33.620 --> 00:17:37.670
<v Speaker 1>It was called conspiracy theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did we go to the moon and it showed that</v>

410
00:17:37.671 --> 00:17:42.671
<v Speaker 1>they use the same backdrop for different</v>
<v Speaker 1>moon missions that were supposedly like</v>

411
00:17:43.490 --> 00:17:47.420
<v Speaker 1>really far apart from each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the back backdrops sinked up.</v>

412
00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:52.870
<v Speaker 1>There was all sorts of images that</v>
<v Speaker 1>showed different shadows that we're</v>

413
00:17:54.211 --> 00:17:57.870
<v Speaker 1>moving at different angles that would</v>
<v Speaker 1>indicate different light sources that</v>

414
00:17:57.871 --> 00:18:00.870
<v Speaker 1>was more than one life source instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the just the sun.</v>

415
00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.210
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of these things that make</v>
<v Speaker 1>it intriguing.</v>

416
00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:08.240
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that stuff is that I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know Jack Shit about aerospace</v>

417
00:18:09.091 --> 00:18:10.950
<v Speaker 1>engineering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anything about it.</v>

418
00:18:10.951 --> 00:18:15.450
<v Speaker 1>I have zero,</v>
<v Speaker 1>zero education in physics.</v>

419
00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:18.110
<v Speaker 1>How Kodak works in space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how any of that.</v>

420
00:18:18.111 --> 00:18:19.920
<v Speaker 1>That's also part of the problem is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>images,</v>

421
00:18:19.950 --> 00:18:22.050
<v Speaker 1>the images.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people like how are the images</v>

422
00:18:22.051 --> 00:18:24.660
<v Speaker 1>so perfectly squared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no errors.</v>

423
00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:28.020
<v Speaker 1>There's some of the images where things</v>
<v Speaker 1>are in the shadows.</v>

424
00:18:28.021 --> 00:18:30.060
<v Speaker 1>They're lit up like there's backfill</v>
<v Speaker 1>being used,</v>

425
00:18:30.330 --> 00:18:31.860
<v Speaker 1>but that still doesn't mean they didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

426
00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.190
<v Speaker 1>They definitely faked some images.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a fact.</v>

427
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.500
<v Speaker 1>They know this because there's Gemini</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifteen,</v>

428
00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:41.040
<v Speaker 1>there's a Michael Collins photo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was absolutely a photo that they</v>

429
00:18:41.041 --> 00:18:44.910
<v Speaker 1>used of him in a training mission and</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you could see the harnesses and</v>

430
00:18:44.911 --> 00:18:47.130
<v Speaker 1>all that jazz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they blacked it out and they</v>

431
00:18:47.131 --> 00:18:50.070
<v Speaker 1>use it as a publicity photo saying that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's on a space walk,</v>

432
00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.980
<v Speaker 1>but that could have been an overzealous</v>
<v Speaker 1>publicist.</v>

433
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:56.130
<v Speaker 1>You got to look at everything like</v>
<v Speaker 1>really objectively.</v>

434
00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.460
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wanted.</v>

435
00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:00.450
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted the moon landing to be fake.</v>

436
00:19:00.451 --> 00:19:02.440
<v Speaker 1>It seemed fun to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wanted it to be.</v>

437
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.430
<v Speaker 1>There's so many things that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the um,</v>

438
00:19:06.030 --> 00:19:07.990
<v Speaker 1>what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Prime Minister of Holland who is in</v>

439
00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:10.170
<v Speaker 1>Holland and I met Bazal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They met,</v>

440
00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:15.410
<v Speaker 1>they gave this guy a piece of moon rock</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it turned out to be a piece of</v>

441
00:19:15.841 --> 00:19:18.050
<v Speaker 1>petrified wood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was signed in.</v>

442
00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:22.830
<v Speaker 1>A plaque was delivered by Michael</v>
<v Speaker 1>Collins and Buzz Aldrin and Neil</v>

443
00:19:22.830 --> 00:19:23.161
<v Speaker 1>Armstrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're like,</v>

444
00:19:23.161 --> 00:19:24.880
<v Speaker 1>this is a piece of moon rock for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

445
00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:26.970
<v Speaker 1>we're giving this to Holland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is amazing.</v>

446
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:27.811
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

447
00:19:27.811 --> 00:19:29.460
<v Speaker 1>you've given us a piece of the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so cool.</v>

448
00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:31.680
<v Speaker 1>And then they finally wound up finding</v>
<v Speaker 1>any testing it.</v>

449
00:19:31.681 --> 00:19:34.590
<v Speaker 1>It's a piece of petrified wood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't for the moon is fake.</v>

450
00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:35.340
<v Speaker 1>It's fake.</v>

451
00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:36.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the Dutch law,</v>

452
00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:39.300
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a gift to a control.</v>

453
00:19:39.301 --> 00:19:42.720
<v Speaker 1>I say the Dutch are wild man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that also could have been.</v>

454
00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.450
<v Speaker 1>You got to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about the 19 sixties.</v>

455
00:19:45.451 --> 00:19:47.490
<v Speaker 1>Richard Nixon was the president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was an asshole.</v>

456
00:19:47.730 --> 00:19:49.240
<v Speaker 1>You know who needs like probably fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

457
00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:50.590
<v Speaker 1>Not Giving them a moon rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get,</v>

458
00:19:50.650 --> 00:19:51.030
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get,</v>

459
00:19:51.030 --> 00:19:53.270
<v Speaker 1>get one of those petrified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This will be full area.</v>

460
00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:57.360
<v Speaker 1>Take a piece of petrified wood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got four kilograms of moon rock.</v>

461
00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:01.030
<v Speaker 1>Shit to the Dutch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Dutch.</v>

462
00:20:01.031 --> 00:20:02.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>

463
00:20:02.101 --> 00:20:04.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean actually who gives a fuck,</v>

464
00:20:04.390 --> 00:20:05.223
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

465
00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:06.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>respect to the Dutch,</v>

466
00:20:06.871 --> 00:20:09.600
<v Speaker 1>but some of the greatest boxers of all</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

467
00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:12.270
<v Speaker 1>Really that one spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they're aerodynamic till you ever</v>

468
00:20:12.271 --> 00:20:15.400
<v Speaker 1>seen a Dutch person to pig will and also</v>
<v Speaker 1>there rick streaming,</v>

469
00:20:15.401 --> 00:20:17.450
<v Speaker 1>you can look at their faces are</v>
<v Speaker 1>extremely or dynamic.</v>

470
00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.980
<v Speaker 1>Seemed to travel through space better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that what you're saying?</v>

471
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:22.860
<v Speaker 1>I think if you take like one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>front of a plane,</v>

472
00:20:24.030 --> 00:20:25.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't be that hard on him.</v>

473
00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:27.840
<v Speaker 1>Good to have good symmetry that we were</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

474
00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:29.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you look at the Dutch,</v>

475
00:20:29.671 --> 00:20:31.620
<v Speaker 1>their heads tall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

476
00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:36.440
<v Speaker 1>It's like I'm good genes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably Vikings.</v>

477
00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:38.400
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably some viking genes hold</v>

478
00:20:38.410 --> 00:20:41.160
<v Speaker 1>the big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really big people and they got</v>

479
00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:44.280
<v Speaker 1>total craniums space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a lot of room in their head</v>

480
00:20:44.281 --> 00:20:46.020
<v Speaker 1>for ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

481
00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:47.980
<v Speaker 1>Plus they will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of</v>

482
00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:49.780
<v Speaker 2>the first people to say who gives a shit</v>
<v Speaker 2>about weed?</v>

483
00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:52.000
<v Speaker 2>Everybody used to go to Amsterdam to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>high.</v>

484
00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:54.580
<v Speaker 2>Well the problem with Amsterdam is</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's those trains,</v>

485
00:20:54.581 --> 00:20:56.860
<v Speaker 2>there's people on bikes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the worst place to walk around</v>

486
00:20:56.861 --> 00:20:59.590
<v Speaker 2>high because there's so many forms of</v>
<v Speaker 2>transportation going on.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And then in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

566
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:24.550
<v Speaker 1>cause I'm probably about 60 percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>gullible sand.</v>

567
00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:26.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

00:24:26.871 --> 00:24:29.100
<v Speaker 1>life and kind of charted out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went up and gullible and when I</v>

569
00:24:29.101 --> 00:24:30.920
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the biggest one that you look</v>

<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

573
00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:40.540
<v Speaker 1>I would say probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>real overall religion.</v>

574
00:24:42.410 --> 00:24:44.510
<v Speaker 1>Probably when I was super religious when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were a kid.</v>

575
00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:47.360
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't super religious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I just wanted it to be real.</v>

579
00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:54.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I wanted it to be real.</v>

580
00:24:54.851 --> 00:24:55.970
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just made it hard.</v>

581
00:24:55.971 --> 00:24:58.190
<v Speaker 1>It made it tough for some other things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's not the best book.</v>

590
00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:19.270
<v Speaker 1>Well it was really good when it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>written yet.</v>

591
00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like trying to watch a movie from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 19 thirties.</v>

592
00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:24.410
<v Speaker 1>You'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at this Corny fucking acting.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:29.540
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's nine chapters about</v>

596
00:25:29.541 --> 00:25:31.100
<v Speaker 1>livestock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it gets,</v>

597
00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:33.980
<v Speaker 1>it gets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets held risk,</v>

598
00:25:33.981 --> 00:25:36.830
<v Speaker 1>a in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really read the whole thing cover to</v>

599
00:25:36.831 --> 00:25:39.590
<v Speaker 1>cover and I haven't read any of it in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

600
00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:41.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read it when I was in,</v>

601
00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.640
<v Speaker 1>when I was in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I was,</v>

602
00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:46.340
<v Speaker 1>I was living in Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was 11.</v>

603
00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good time to read them out in</v>

604
00:25:48.111 --> 00:25:50.930
<v Speaker 1>school and I remember my parents being a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little disturbed,</v>

605
00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:55.940
<v Speaker 1>but because I'd gone from a Catholic</v>
<v Speaker 1>school and the first grade my mom split</v>

606
00:25:56.571 --> 00:25:59.490
<v Speaker 1>up with my dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom shacked up with my Stepdad who</v>

607
00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:02.120
<v Speaker 1>was a hippie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She kind of became a bit of a hippie too</v>

608
00:26:02.121 --> 00:26:03.620
<v Speaker 1>and we fell way out of religion.</v>

609
00:26:03.620 --> 00:26:06.770
<v Speaker 1>So the Catholic church and all that</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff was a thing of the past.</v>

610
00:26:06.771 --> 00:26:08.930
<v Speaker 1>Was that pretty cool?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hippie Stepdad.</v>

611
00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.210
<v Speaker 1>He's a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very nice guy.</v>

612
00:26:12.290 --> 00:26:13.640
<v Speaker 1>It was weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

613
00:26:13.670 --> 00:26:16.340
<v Speaker 1>he had long hair and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like long hair,</v>

614
00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:19.040
<v Speaker 1>like down to the middle of his back and</v>
<v Speaker 1>so like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>like crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you ever like see him from behind?</v>

616
00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:23.320

<v Speaker 1>from Pharrell.</v>

617
00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:25.740
<v Speaker 1>Well because he was muscular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

618
00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:29.510
<v Speaker 1>he looked like a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's a man with long hair.</v>

619
00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So what is 11?</v>

623
00:26:39.411 --> 00:26:41.840

<v Speaker 1>he was taking college courses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

648
00:27:41.970 --> 00:27:44.010
<v Speaker 1>11 nerd alert.</v>

649
00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:48.270

<v Speaker 1>I don't want to write an article about</v>

650
00:27:48.271 --> 00:27:50.190
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spirit of bad information,</v>

651
00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:55.610

<v Speaker 1>anyway when they were together.</v>

652
00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:59.130
<v Speaker 1>That was their only biological kid and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not really their biological kid.</v>

653
00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:02.550
<v Speaker 1>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because it's fucking Frank Sinatra's kid</v>

654
00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:05.850
<v Speaker 1>started college at age 11.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

655
00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:10.050
<v Speaker 1>He says he fell apart while pursuing the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harvey Weinstein Story.</v>

656
00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:13.530
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean he fell apart?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably because it was so dark.</v>

657
00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:15.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

<v Speaker 1>out?</v>

660
00:28:18.270 --> 00:28:20.100
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knew that guy was a creep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

661
00:28:20.101 --> 00:28:22.440

664
00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:28.320
<v Speaker 1>lives under a rock somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody knew he was a creep.</v>

665
00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:30.000
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody had heard stories.</v>

666
00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:33.600
<v Speaker 1>But this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he graduated at 15 from college.</v>

667
00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does he keep saying the son of Mia</v>

668
00:28:40.290 --> 00:28:42.000
<v Speaker 1>Farrow and Woody Allen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should say wink,</v>

669
00:28:42.001 --> 00:28:43.110
<v Speaker 1>wink,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nudge,</v>

670
00:28:43.111 --> 00:28:44.460
<v Speaker 1>nudge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's crazy though.</v>

671
00:28:44.490 --> 00:28:46.650
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to push that so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

672
00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:48.330
<v Speaker 1>the son of Mia Farrow and Woody Allen.</v>

673
00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:51.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was raised by them for a little while</v>

674
00:28:51.001 --> 00:28:53.790
<v Speaker 1>until he started banging his sister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

675
00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:54.870
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

676
00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:58.350
<v Speaker 1>that's a freak household.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the dark arts out here,</v>

677
00:28:58.351 --> 00:29:00.030
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood's got the darkest arts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bro.</v>

678
00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:02.880
<v Speaker 1>They lived in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well even New York,</v>

679
00:29:02.881 --> 00:29:05.430
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because some of it's the same thing.</v>

680
00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:06.360
<v Speaker 1>New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood.</v>

681
00:29:06.360 --> 00:29:08.020
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood is just show business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

682
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:09.120
<v Speaker 1>show business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I mean.</v>

683
00:29:09.660 --> 00:29:11.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely something to that</v>

684
00:29:11.041 --> 00:29:15.300
<v Speaker 1>because how about that composer that</v>
<v Speaker 1>turned out to be even more of a fucking</v>

685
00:29:15.301 --> 00:29:18.900
<v Speaker 1>asshole and Harvey Weinstein,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is one composer that was just</v>

686
00:29:18.901 --> 00:29:22.710
<v Speaker 1>fucking all these young boys and if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't fuck him and they just.</v>

687
00:29:22.711 --> 00:29:27.300
<v Speaker 1>They recently got rid of him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was just running things through</v>

688
00:29:27.301 --> 00:29:30.420
<v Speaker 1>sex and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just basically had a sex cult going</v>

689
00:29:30.421 --> 00:29:32.130
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find out who the fuck that guy was.</v>

690
00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:37.220
<v Speaker 1>But he was a cherished famous loved</v>
<v Speaker 1>composer and it turned out this.</v>

691
00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:40.980
<v Speaker 1>This dude was running the freak show</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind the dirty,</v>

692
00:29:41.290 --> 00:29:42.010
<v Speaker 1>just not just being</v>

693
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:44.140
<v Speaker 2>dirty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that was the way to get in and if</v>

694
00:29:44.141 --> 00:29:46.680
<v Speaker 2>this guy is shut you down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were shut down forever.</v>

695
00:29:46.730 --> 00:29:49.600
<v Speaker 2>You weren't working anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he was like the.</v>

696
00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:52.200
<v Speaker 2>He was the gatekeeper kind.</v>

701
00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:02.500
<v Speaker 2>You're too difficult to work with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he would shut their careers</v>

<v Speaker 2>more confirmed,</v>

714
00:30:35.471 --> 00:30:39.580
<v Speaker 2>like a bunch of people came out and we</v>

00:31:07.331 --> 00:31:09.050
<v Speaker 2>me and my best friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he took us to Marilyn Manson.</v>

727
00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:10.630

<v Speaker 2>everybody wants to be in a convertible</v>

732
00:31:23.290 --> 00:31:27.310

<v Speaker 2>on the baked potatoes and my buddy was</v>

737
00:31:38.771 --> 00:31:42.790

<v Speaker 2>And that's when all the fucking wheels</v>

744
00:31:59.471 --> 00:32:03.220
<v Speaker 2>turned and you realized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh no,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He was just a nice man.</v>

747
00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:10.180
<v Speaker 2>And you were thinking that this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this whole time it was just setting you</v>

748
00:32:10.181 --> 00:32:11.620
<v Speaker 2>up?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

749
00:32:11.621 --> 00:32:13.060
<v Speaker 2>And my buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the biggest thing,</v>

750
00:32:13.061 --> 00:32:16.060
<v Speaker 2>I was so concerned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I brought like for my friends over</v>

751
00:32:16.061 --> 00:32:18.700
<v Speaker 2>there and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what has been going on?</v>

752
00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:21.190
<v Speaker 2>I had a similar situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy named Walter.</v>

753
00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:24.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We used to go fishing and he would run</v>

754
00:32:24.431 --> 00:32:28.480
<v Speaker 2>around the pond and he was um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he mentally handicap?</v>

755
00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:29.171
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

756
00:32:29.171 --> 00:32:32.410
<v Speaker 2>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a teacher and he got fired when I</v>

757
00:32:32.490 --> 00:32:36.940
<v Speaker 2>was trying to explain to us that he had</v>
<v Speaker 2>uncommon unconventional teaching methods</v>

758
00:32:36.941 --> 00:32:39.920
<v Speaker 2>and that they didn't understand his</v>
<v Speaker 2>teaching methods and that</v>

759
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.330
<v Speaker 1>they fired him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

760
00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:43.720
<v Speaker 1>So then he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's like the,</v>

761
00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:46.660
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a very smart guy and two kids,</v>

762
00:32:46.670 --> 00:32:49.200
<v Speaker 1>he probably seemed like the cool guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he's like unconventional and he</v>

763
00:32:49.201 --> 00:32:50.170
<v Speaker 1>was always jogging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

764
00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:51.530
<v Speaker 1>was always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always jogging around this part.</v>

765
00:32:51.770 --> 00:32:52.603
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a gay,</v>

766
00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:55.100
<v Speaker 1>straight bi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he would sit,</v>

767
00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:57.410
<v Speaker 1>he would combine hanging out with us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'd be fishing,</v>

768
00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:01.040
<v Speaker 1>we'd be hanging out the spot and he come</v>
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

769
00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:02.510
<v Speaker 1>sit with us for a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then take off.</v>

770
00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:06.740
<v Speaker 1>So we became friends with this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went over his house once and I'll</v>

771
00:33:06.741 --> 00:33:09.410
<v Speaker 1>never forget I ate at his house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just me and him too.</v>

772
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:13.520
<v Speaker 1>And he didn't do anything but went to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bathroom and uh,</v>

773
00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:18.610
<v Speaker 1>I guess I was 13 somewhere around there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere around 13 at the time.</v>

774
00:33:18.771 --> 00:33:20.660
<v Speaker 1>So while day is a susceptible age?</v>

775
00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:22.133
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>

776
00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:23.683
<v Speaker 1>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

777
00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:27.410
<v Speaker 1>I went to use the bathroom and I peed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I guess he was in the bathroom with</v>

778
00:33:27.411 --> 00:33:29.210
<v Speaker 1>me and afterwards he said something to</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

779
00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:32.440
<v Speaker 1>he goes on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had this weird way of talking and</v>

780
00:33:32.441 --> 00:33:34.430
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know you were showed developed</v>

781
00:33:35.450 --> 00:33:36.051
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

782
00:33:36.051 --> 00:33:37.170
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was,</v>

783
00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:38.300
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

784
00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:41.420
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about with Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he wasn't flirting with me.</v>

785
00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:43.430
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just was like,</v>

786
00:33:43.431 --> 00:33:46.220
<v Speaker 1>he was just talking about my dick being</v>
<v Speaker 1>developed,</v>

787
00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:47.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a curator,</v>

788
00:33:47.661 --> 00:33:50.170
<v Speaker 1>like an art curator or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

789
00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:51.710
<v Speaker 1>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't,</v>

790
00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:54.500
<v Speaker 1>it was weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't dangerous.</v>

791
00:33:54.620 --> 00:33:58.550
<v Speaker 1>But then it got dangerous because I'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>been friends with this guy for months.</v>

792
00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For months we have been going fishing</v>

793
00:34:01.220 --> 00:34:03.980
<v Speaker 1>and he had been coming to this lake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's two places.</v>

794
00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:05.630
<v Speaker 1>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was um,</v>

795
00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.240
<v Speaker 1>Jamaica pond,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was all in all,</v>

796
00:34:08.241 --> 00:34:10.280
<v Speaker 1>this was in Jamaica Plain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there was,</v>

797
00:34:10.281 --> 00:34:13.490
<v Speaker 1>Jamaica pond was this one spot and there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was another pond that was nearby that</v>

798
00:34:13.491 --> 00:34:15.860
<v Speaker 1>was a smaller place that was more</v>
<v Speaker 1>secluded,</v>

799
00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.470
<v Speaker 1>but it had like good pickerl fishing</v>
<v Speaker 1>pickles,</v>

800
00:34:18.471 --> 00:34:21.440
<v Speaker 1>like a small northern pike looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>creature.</v>

801
00:34:22.370 --> 00:34:26.270
<v Speaker 1>And so I was fishing there and pick her</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and stop coughing.</v>

802
00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:30.890
<v Speaker 1>So he shows up drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when it got really weird.</v>

803
00:34:31.250 --> 00:34:33.560
<v Speaker 1>And he told me he loved me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

804
00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:35.090
<v Speaker 1>the academy say it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he say it?</v>

805
00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:35.931
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

806
00:34:35.931 --> 00:34:39.680
<v Speaker 1>he said it like he was behind me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sitting down and I was fishing hot</v>

807
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:41.220
<v Speaker 1>dude that's making me.</v>

00:34:49.400 --> 00:34:50.600
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like you too,</v>

813
00:34:50.601 --> 00:34:50.960
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

814
00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:51.840
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weirded out.</v>

815
00:34:51.841 --> 00:34:53.030
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know what to do because he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>drunk,</v>

816
00:34:53.031 --> 00:34:58.030
<v Speaker 1>like definitely drunk goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there can be no love without sex cheap.</v>

817
00:34:58.400 --> 00:34:59.270
<v Speaker 1>That's what he said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I went,</v>

818
00:34:59.271 --> 00:35:02.840
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember I had a Swiss army knife</v>

819
00:35:02.990 --> 00:35:07.160
<v Speaker 1>in my pocket and I put my hand on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swiss army knife.</v>

820
00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:10.250
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember saying something like,</v>

821
00:35:10.310 --> 00:35:11.810
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you better leave me the fuck alone.</v>

822
00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:13.880
<v Speaker 1>Like something along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

823
00:35:13.881 --> 00:35:16.790
<v Speaker 1>I've got him pulled the knife out</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I was 13 years old.</v>

824
00:35:16.791 --> 00:35:18.710
<v Speaker 1>He was a pretty big guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

825
00:35:18.711 --> 00:35:21.980
<v Speaker 1>even if I pulled his knife out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>am I really going to be able to stab him</v>

826
00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:25.160
<v Speaker 1>seven or eight times?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this Guy gonna beat me to death and</v>

827
00:35:25.161 --> 00:35:27.440
<v Speaker 1>fuck me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what's going to happen here?</v>

828
00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:29.270
<v Speaker 1>But he left me alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He left me alone.</v>

829
00:35:29.271 --> 00:35:32.480
<v Speaker 1>But then he wrote a letter to my house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he found out where I lived.</v>

830
00:35:34.140 --> 00:35:36.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he probably had to get drunk to come</v>

831
00:35:36.261 --> 00:35:38.700
<v Speaker 1>there and do that to be able to even say</v>
<v Speaker 1>that to you.</v>

832
00:35:39.090 --> 00:35:42.720
<v Speaker 1>That's probably why I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he was probably trying to figure</v>

833
00:35:42.721 --> 00:35:45.630
<v Speaker 1>out a way to work his way up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>molesting me.</v>

834
00:35:47.490 --> 00:35:50.640
<v Speaker 1>So I think that's probably why he got</v>
<v Speaker 1>fired from school.</v>

835
00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:52.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

836
00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:56.790
<v Speaker 1>Do you feel a little bit bad that he had</v>
<v Speaker 1>led them on?</v>

837
00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:07.740
<v Speaker 1>I was a little cutie DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a kid.</v>

838
00:36:07.741 --> 00:36:12.280
<v Speaker 1>But did you feel a little bit bad that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had kind of taken advantage of like,</v>

839
00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:14.440
<v Speaker 1>like fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we can't kind of be free,</v>

840
00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:17.190
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you think in ia that was.</v>

841
00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:21.720
<v Speaker 1>I did enjoy talking to him because he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was telling me about things like he knew</v>

842
00:36:21.721 --> 00:36:24.840
<v Speaker 1>a lot of things about life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was definitely a very educated guy.</v>

843
00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:29.890
<v Speaker 1>So before the drunken weirdness and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the general,</v>

844
00:36:30.010 --> 00:36:32.760
<v Speaker 1>it just got more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more comfortable he got with us,</v>

845
00:36:32.761 --> 00:36:36.510
<v Speaker 1>the more I realized that this guy was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was attracted to children and he was</v>

846
00:36:36.511 --> 00:36:37.860
<v Speaker 1>trying to fight it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

847
00:36:37.890 --> 00:36:39.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of people that are</v>

848
00:36:39.421 --> 00:36:41.610
<v Speaker 1>pedophiles are extremely embarrassed by</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

849
00:36:41.850 --> 00:36:43.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a sickness man.</v>

850
00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:43.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

851
00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:47.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's something anybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>chooses to do unless they're trying to</v>

852
00:36:47.311 --> 00:36:50.480
<v Speaker 1>start like a track team or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe in the Philippines or south.</v>

853
00:36:51.450 --> 00:36:55.440
<v Speaker 1>Well I ran into my friend Josh and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>told him immediately because Josh used</v>

854
00:36:55.441 --> 00:36:58.920
<v Speaker 1>to go fishing with me and we both knew</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy and I explained to him the</v>

855
00:36:58.921 --> 00:37:00.750
<v Speaker 1>whole deal and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

856
00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:03.630
<v Speaker 1>And so he was scared too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>

857
00:37:03.631 --> 00:37:04.800
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna stab that fucking guy.</v>

858
00:37:04.980 --> 00:37:07.620
<v Speaker 1>And Josh went extra hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He went extra hard,</v>

859
00:37:07.650 --> 00:37:08.221
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

860
00:37:08.221 --> 00:37:12.540
<v Speaker 1>aggression and anger because his parents</v>
<v Speaker 1>were lesbians.</v>

861
00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:14.910
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had two parents are lesbians.</v>

862
00:37:14.911 --> 00:37:18.840
<v Speaker 1>So he wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he wanted me to know that he</v>

863
00:37:18.841 --> 00:37:20.340
<v Speaker 1>wasn't gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

864
00:37:20.341 --> 00:37:21.870
<v Speaker 1>And it was mom's gay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

865
00:37:21.871 --> 00:37:23.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was like all fucked up.</v>

866
00:37:23.521 --> 00:37:24.211
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

867
00:37:24.211 --> 00:37:26.070

<v Speaker 1>Like whoa down.</v>

868

869
00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:27.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

870
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:29.100
<v Speaker 1>This has to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

871
00:37:29.130 --> 00:37:32.520
<v Speaker 1>He was like fucking sword up in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>warehouse.</v>

872
00:37:32.610 --> 00:37:35.640
<v Speaker 1>That is not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he called him a faggot.</v>

873
00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:39.210
<v Speaker 1>I think I made that up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I literally barely remember because I</v>

874
00:37:39.211 --> 00:37:41.730
<v Speaker 1>was 13.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do remember him saying that though,</v>

875
00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:44.310
<v Speaker 1>that there could be no love without sex</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I remember like,</v>

876
00:37:44.311 --> 00:37:47.550
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy what a gateway line to</v>

877
00:37:47.551 --> 00:37:48.750
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a pedophile,</v>

878
00:37:48.751 --> 00:37:51.840
<v Speaker 1>like I'm glad I don't have that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that element,</v>

879
00:37:51.841 --> 00:37:53.880
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be so tough to be,</v>

880
00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:56.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hanging around kids and also like,</v>

881
00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:57.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to like,</v>

882
00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:01.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk to them about dates or stuff.</v>

883
00:38:01.410 --> 00:38:03.210
<v Speaker 1>What's the incurable one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two.</v>

884
00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:05.940
<v Speaker 1>There is no cure for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the.</v>

885
00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:09.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless they can rewire your brain,</v>

886
00:38:09.110 --> 00:38:13.590
<v Speaker 1>your brain with Iowasca and Ibogaine</v>
<v Speaker 1>electric shock therapy.</v>

887
00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:18.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The recidivism rate is super high for</v>

888
00:38:18.271 --> 00:38:20.070
<v Speaker 1>people that are child molesters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>

889
00:38:20.071 --> 00:38:22.070
<v Speaker 1>People that do it again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

890
00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:24.870
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really high when kids are.</v>

891
00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:27.030
<v Speaker 1>It's also something you can't even talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

892
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:30.210
<v Speaker 1>Like say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine if you have like a mental</v>

893
00:38:30.211 --> 00:38:34.710
<v Speaker 1>illness that makes you prone to violent</v>
<v Speaker 1>outbursts,</v>

894
00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.040
<v Speaker 1>but you got it under control and</v>

895
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.980
<v Speaker 2>you never actually hurt anybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

896
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:40.660
<v Speaker 2>you never actually heard anybody but you</v>
<v Speaker 2>understand you have this problem.</v>

897
00:38:40.661 --> 00:38:42.570
<v Speaker 2>So you take medication and people go</v>
<v Speaker 2>good for you.</v>

898
00:38:42.750 --> 00:38:44.140
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go to therapy,</v>

899
00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:46.630
<v Speaker 2>I have anger management issues,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I go to therapy.</v>

900
00:38:46.810 --> 00:38:47.411
<v Speaker 2>People are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

902
00:38:48.521 --> 00:38:51.340
<v Speaker 2>You keep it under wraps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you say I want to fuck kids,</v>

903
00:38:51.341 --> 00:38:53.800
<v Speaker 2>but I never have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>everybody wants to put a bullet in your</v>

906

916
00:39:19.991 --> 00:39:23.110
<v Speaker 2>The thing that you could leave your kids</v>
<v Speaker 2>out and someone could snatch them up and</v>

921
00:39:34.091 --> 00:39:36.340
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember one time I never had anything</v>

<v Speaker 2>I took some mushrooms one time to a,</v>

923
00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:43.600
<v Speaker 2>a party in high school because I grew up</v>
<v Speaker 2>in an area where you could just get</v>

924
00:39:43.601 --> 00:39:45.550
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Psychedelic mushrooms grew on</v>

00:39:54.371 --> 00:39:57.040
<v Speaker 2>everybody had something shitting in</v>
<v Speaker 2>their yard and then it would rain every</v>

929
00:39:57.041 --> 00:39:58.420
<v Speaker 2>single day for about a half hour.</v>

930
00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:00.100
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was just.</v>

931
00:40:00.101 --> 00:40:01.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see people picking them and eating</v>

932
00:40:01.841 --> 00:40:04.630
<v Speaker 2>them and families out there and join</v>
<v Speaker 2>them in the afternoon.</v>

933
00:40:04.631 --> 00:40:05.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody was,</v>

934
00:40:05.860 --> 00:40:07.570
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was psychedelic heaven.</v>

935
00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:11.350
<v Speaker 2>So we would ride out and go get them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember one time getting a trash bag</v>

936
00:40:11.590 --> 00:40:13.600
<v Speaker 2>of probably about 35 pounds of</v>
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms.</v>

937
00:40:13.601 --> 00:40:17.410
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we picked all day and one time a</v>

938
00:40:17.411 --> 00:40:20.140
<v Speaker 2>golden retriever came running at us</v>
<v Speaker 2>across this field and we thought he was</v>

939
00:40:20.141 --> 00:40:21.970
<v Speaker 2>pissed because we were tripping and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got to us.</v>

940
00:40:21.971 --> 00:40:25.870
<v Speaker 2>We ran for like a half mile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got to is oddly,</v>

941
00:40:26.290 --> 00:40:30.320
<v Speaker 2>we're crawling away from thinking he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>evil and he fucking loved us and licked</v>

942
00:40:30.670 --> 00:40:34.540
<v Speaker 2>mean golden retriever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We thought he was mean bras because the</v>

943
00:40:34.541 --> 00:40:36.220
<v Speaker 2>hair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his hair was kind of slicked back.</v>

944
00:40:36.250 --> 00:40:38.350
<v Speaker 2>Oh look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an evil golden retriever.</v>

945
00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:39.081
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in that movie,</v>

946
00:40:39.081 --> 00:40:40.060
<v Speaker 2>sometimes they come back.</v>

947
00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:41.620
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Stephen King movie,</v>

948
00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:45.340
<v Speaker 2>it was kind of like that kind of hair,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pet cemetery?</v>

949
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:47.020
<v Speaker 2>Which ones?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they come back.</v>

950
00:40:48.010 --> 00:40:48.680
<v Speaker 2>The Nea?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

951
00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:51.610
<v Speaker 2>it's about men that show up back at a</v>
<v Speaker 2>high school and they all died years</v>

952
00:40:51.611 --> 00:40:53.470
<v Speaker 2>earlier in a car accident and they show</v>
<v Speaker 2>back up.</v>

953
00:40:53.471 --> 00:40:55.960
<v Speaker 2>It's like a Stephen King when I think it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was just made for TV.</v>

954
00:40:56.290 --> 00:40:59.020
<v Speaker 2>When did that one come out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It may be 18 years ago.</v>

955
00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:04.000
<v Speaker 2>Has there ever been a dude who wrote</v>
<v Speaker 2>more awesome horror movies and books and</v>

956
00:41:04.001 --> 00:41:06.260
<v Speaker 2>Steven fucking King?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

957
00:41:06.340 --> 00:41:08.380
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that published them.</v>

958
00:41:08.381 --> 00:41:09.940
<v Speaker 2>Unless somebody just has them all at</v>
<v Speaker 2>their house.</v>

959
00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:12.160
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they come back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit me.</v>

960
00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:15.760
<v Speaker 2>He's the king of those kinds of movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

961
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:17.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not even close.</v>

962
00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:20.410
<v Speaker 2>Tim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's his name was Tim Matheson,</v>

963
00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:22.090
<v Speaker 2>who I interviewed one time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really Nice man.</v>

964
00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:23.800
<v Speaker 2>You did?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What'd you interview him for?</v>

965
00:41:24.550 --> 00:41:26.740
<v Speaker 2>He had a new movie coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember.</v>

966
00:41:26.741 --> 00:41:30.010
<v Speaker 2>It was called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sweet man.</v>

967
00:41:30.510 --> 00:41:32.140
<v Speaker 2>I bet he got a lot of posts over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

968
00:41:32.141 --> 00:41:32.974
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't talk about</v>

969
00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:37.650
<v Speaker 1>because he's got that safe man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look safe,</v>

970
00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:38.300
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

971
00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:39.710
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of ladies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

972
00:41:39.711 --> 00:41:41.870
<v Speaker 1>he's got that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's got that kind of sexy,</v>

973
00:41:41.871 --> 00:41:46.190
<v Speaker 1>but also safe that Matt Lauer look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

974
00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:47.710
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's got that mailer.</v>

975
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:50.540
<v Speaker 1>You think about Lauer's dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was definitely dirty.</v>

976
00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:55.340
<v Speaker 1>See he's got that cheap Michael Land and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got that cheap.</v>

977
00:41:55.341 --> 00:41:57.740
<v Speaker 1>Michael Landon going right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it could be a little bit</v>

978
00:41:57.741 --> 00:42:00.120
<v Speaker 1>of native American.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looks like a generous right there.</v>

979
00:42:00.121 --> 00:42:01.190
<v Speaker 1>It looks like a little bit of guys went</v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

980
00:42:01.191 --> 00:42:05.690
<v Speaker 1>A little bit of lesbian and this one too</v>
<v Speaker 1>generous with the smile.</v>

981
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:07.640
<v Speaker 1>There's the animal house picture above</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

982
00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:09.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How good was he?</v>

983
00:42:09.411 --> 00:42:10.530
<v Speaker 1>An animal house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So good.</v>

984
00:42:10.970 --> 00:42:14.120
<v Speaker 1>What a movie that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched that again a few years back.</v>

985
00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:16.260
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't seen in forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

986
00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:18.860
<v Speaker 1>That was a good movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's some shit in that movie you</v>

987
00:42:18.861 --> 00:42:21.200
<v Speaker 1>could never get away with today.</v>

988
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:24.920
<v Speaker 1>Now never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a scene where the girl's passed</v>

989
00:42:24.921 --> 00:42:29.921
<v Speaker 1>out and whose car was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Balloon knows whose character was</v>

990
00:42:30.501 --> 00:42:33.350
<v Speaker 1>thinking about fucking her while she was</v>
<v Speaker 1>blacked out.</v>

991
00:42:34.640 --> 00:42:38.480
<v Speaker 1>You remember that scene?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a scene in it.</v>

992
00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:39.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The girl,</v>

993
00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:41.870
<v Speaker 1>she takes her gum off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she pulls her bra.</v>

994
00:42:41.900 --> 00:42:45.780
<v Speaker 1>Who is that guy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you get them in their mouth or</v>

995
00:42:45.781 --> 00:42:48.350
<v Speaker 1>they're about to fuck you ever notice</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they don't want bad breath.</v>

996
00:42:48.410 --> 00:42:49.221
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

997
00:42:49.221 --> 00:42:51.080
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a devil on his shoulder and then</v>

998
00:42:51.081 --> 00:42:53.900
<v Speaker 1>the angels on his other soul,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she blacks out with their titties out</v>

999
00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:55.490
<v Speaker 1>and the devil is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucker,</v>

1000
00:42:55.850 --> 00:42:59.030
<v Speaker 1>fuck her fucker fucking brains out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the angels like,</v>

1001
00:42:59.031 --> 00:43:00.590
<v Speaker 1>don't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't do it.</v>

1002
00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:05.090
<v Speaker 1>But the fact that this is in a movie</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they're essentially debating</v>

1003
00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:09.530
<v Speaker 1>whether or not he should rape her now</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was willing to have sex with them</v>

1004
00:43:09.531 --> 00:43:10.340
<v Speaker 1>just moments ago.</v>

1005
00:43:10.340 --> 00:43:14.420
<v Speaker 1>But she's clearly unconscious and</v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly not able to consent.</v>

1006
00:43:14.630 --> 00:43:15.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she was black.</v>

1007
00:43:15.651 --> 00:43:16.590
<v Speaker 1>The fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She,</v>

1008
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:21.130
<v Speaker 1>she was totally down for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he's holding onto cotton that was in</v>

1009
00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:26.120
<v Speaker 1>her bra and she just blacked out and</v>
<v Speaker 1>fell asleep.</v>

1010
00:43:26.180 --> 00:43:27.013
<v Speaker 1>Cup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bonk.</v>

1011
00:43:27.550 --> 00:43:29.780
<v Speaker 1>And he's popped out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You would never have this scene in a</v>

1012
00:43:29.781 --> 00:43:32.090
<v Speaker 1>movie today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People would be outraged.</v>

1013
00:43:32.091 --> 00:43:34.640
<v Speaker 1>They would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would say the direct you are Roman</v>

1014
00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:35.473
<v Speaker 1>Polanski,</v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of shit.</v>

1015
00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:38.570
<v Speaker 1>You're a fucking molester.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're a monster,</v>

1016
00:43:38.630 --> 00:43:40.120
<v Speaker 1>you're an abuser.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1017
00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:42.650
<v Speaker 1>but do you think that still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That still happens though?</v>

1018
00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:44.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing definitely happens</v>

1019
00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:46.490
<v Speaker 1>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People do all murder.</v>

1020
00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:49.130
<v Speaker 1>Murder still happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember there was a school shooting</v>

1021
00:43:49.131 --> 00:43:51.410
<v Speaker 1>today in Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean horrible things happen,</v>

1022
00:43:51.830 --> 00:43:54.380
<v Speaker 1>but the point is like that kind of scene</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the movie,</v>

1023
00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:56.900
<v Speaker 1>in a comedy movie you could never do</v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

1024
00:43:57.620 --> 00:44:00.680
<v Speaker 1>but they say that our code,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that makes me think like they say art</v>

1025
00:44:00.681 --> 00:44:03.830
<v Speaker 1>imitates life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if it doesn't really imitate life</v>

1026
00:44:03.831 --> 00:44:07.400
<v Speaker 1>anymore than it's just</v>
<v Speaker 1>are we are we,</v>

1027
00:44:07.401 --> 00:44:08.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just.</v>

1028
00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:09.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what are we making?</v>

1029
00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:13.740
<v Speaker 1>The thing is that in a comedy and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1030
00:44:13.741 --> 00:44:16.250
<v Speaker 1>the lead of the story or one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>heroes of the story,</v>

1031
00:44:16.251 --> 00:44:19.700
<v Speaker 1>that guy in that scene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would not want the hero of the story</v>

1032
00:44:19.701 --> 00:44:22.970
<v Speaker 1>to do something so horrific and</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that you can laugh at because</v>

1033
00:44:22.971 --> 00:44:25.940
<v Speaker 1>you would have to be judging him by his</v>
<v Speaker 1>crime and we all agree that that's a</v>

1034
00:44:25.941 --> 00:44:29.180
<v Speaker 1>crime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what is this I see from meatballs.</v>

1035
00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:32.790
<v Speaker 1>What does this have to do with as it</v>
<v Speaker 1>gets to in here?</v>

1036
00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:35.040
<v Speaker 1>Bill Murray starts doing the same kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thing with the girl.</v>

1037
00:44:35.850 --> 00:44:36.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a girl.</v>

1038
00:44:38.190 --> 00:44:39.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

1039
00:44:39.031 --> 00:44:42.750
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to rape her while he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to be sexually aggressive.</v>

1040
00:44:42.751 --> 00:44:44.670
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're wrestling around being sexually</v>

1041
00:44:44.671 --> 00:44:45.720
<v Speaker 1>aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is the new.</v>

1042
00:44:45.721 --> 00:44:47.910
<v Speaker 1>Is that thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was throwing himself at her and she</v>

1043
00:44:47.911 --> 00:44:48.744
<v Speaker 1>got out of the way.</v>

<v Speaker 1>without having a lawyer on retainer.</v>

1047
00:44:58.080 --> 00:45:00.720
<v Speaker 1>But nuts are on contingency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like.</v>

1048
00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:05.580
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like it's so dang injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You imagine if it turns out that you're</v>

1049
00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:09.930
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a sex criminal for jerking</v>
<v Speaker 1>off to a certain type of thing.</v>

1050
00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:13.470
<v Speaker 1>Like what if you're into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do they find out?</v>

00:45:13.471 --> 00:45:17.850
<v Speaker 1>You're into girls getting tied up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jerk off to videos of girls getting tied</v>

<v Speaker 1>like snm shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just.</v>

1054
00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:27.030
<v Speaker 1>It was just like my scouts of America</v>
<v Speaker 1>type of shit.</v>

1055
00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:29.910
<v Speaker 1>I was reading this thing about this guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>who got arrested for child porn.</v>

1056
00:45:30.060 --> 00:45:32.730
<v Speaker 1>They wanted them for something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They caught him and arrested him for</v>

1057
00:45:32.731 --> 00:45:37.140
<v Speaker 1>child porn and like there's also some</v>
<v Speaker 1>suspicion attached to it accusations,</v>

1058
00:45:37.710 --> 00:45:41.640
<v Speaker 1>but all you have to have is have child</v>
<v Speaker 1>porn.</v>

1059
00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:47.000
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to be a child molester,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just have to have the images and</v>

1060
00:45:47.131 --> 00:45:51.210
<v Speaker 1>you're a bad guy and you're the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to jail like it's one of</v>

1061
00:45:51.211 --> 00:45:54.660
<v Speaker 1>the few things you could have on your</v>
<v Speaker 1>laptop.</v>

1062
00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:56.280
<v Speaker 1>They can come over your house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your house.</v>

1063
00:45:56.490 --> 00:46:00.630
<v Speaker 1>They checked feel Vaughn's laptop and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's 100 videos from Isis and then</v>

1064
00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:03.620
<v Speaker 1>and chopping heads off with dull knives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stabbing them.</v>

1065
00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:05.490
<v Speaker 1>The next shooting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm lighting them on fire.</v>

1066
00:46:05.970 --> 00:46:10.970
<v Speaker 1>Nothing happens to nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One video of a kid that looks under age</v>

1067
00:46:13.501 --> 00:46:16.140
<v Speaker 1>getting fucked and you're going to jail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a video,</v>

1068
00:46:16.290 --> 00:46:20.100
<v Speaker 1>not you doing anything but you being in</v>
<v Speaker 1>possession of that kind of crime.</v>

1069
00:46:20.310 --> 00:46:23.160
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we make big differentiations,</v>

1070
00:46:23.161 --> 00:46:25.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've really clearly differentiate</v>

1071
00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:29.880
<v Speaker 1>between some crimes that you can have on</v>
<v Speaker 1>your computer in a video form like</v>

1072
00:46:29.881 --> 00:46:32.910
<v Speaker 1>murder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you could download on live leak or</v>

1073
00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:34.500
<v Speaker 1>100 different websites.</v>

1074
00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get videos of people getting</v>

1075
00:46:36.961 --> 00:46:37.771
<v Speaker 1>murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1076
00:46:37.771 --> 00:46:39.630
<v Speaker 1>and you can watch it almost every night</v>
<v Speaker 1>on television,</v>

1077
00:46:39.631 --> 00:46:43.320
<v Speaker 1>like in a kind of specially packaged way</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's really is about the murder,</v>

1078
00:46:43.321 --> 00:46:44.250
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1079
00:46:44.251 --> 00:46:45.840
<v Speaker 1>and all these shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fake stuff.</v>

1080
00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:47.100
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You watched fake stuff.</v>

1081
00:46:47.550 --> 00:46:49.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely watch fake rape.</v>

1082
00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:54.980
<v Speaker 1>Rape and movies were horrific scenes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you have that on your computer</v>

1083
00:46:55.530 --> 00:46:58.170
<v Speaker 1>and it's child porn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are going to jail.</v>

1084
00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:01.560
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the only things would if</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's drawings of that.</v>

1085
00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:03.440
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

1086
00:47:03.441 --> 00:47:06.750
<v Speaker 1>there's a real debate about that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's naked children in the 18</v>

1087
00:47:06.751 --> 00:47:08.100
<v Speaker 1>hundreds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had all these paintings of naked</v>

1088
00:47:08.101 --> 00:47:12.360
<v Speaker 1>children dancing in the fucking woods in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sky and will remember those guys,</v>

1089
00:47:12.361 --> 00:47:14.370
<v Speaker 1>but balloons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's different because it was</v>

1090
00:47:14.371 --> 00:47:16.800
<v Speaker 1>naked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Children weren't being portrayed in a</v>

1091
00:47:16.801 --> 00:47:17.670
<v Speaker 1>sexual way.</v>

1092
00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:20.130
<v Speaker 1>They were just free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just didn't have any clothes on.</v>

1093
00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:21.720
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one was fucking.</v>

1094
00:47:22.020 --> 00:47:25.080
<v Speaker 1>But you're telling me that a guy likes</v>
<v Speaker 1>kid isn't looking at those naked kids</v>

1095
00:47:25.081 --> 00:47:28.350
<v Speaker 1>with the flute and thinking wildness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well he can think wildness,</v>

1096
00:47:28.351 --> 00:47:32.650
<v Speaker 1>but it's not being specifically designed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to excite.</v>

1097
00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:34.030
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rouse you.</v>

1098
00:47:34.270 --> 00:47:37.570
<v Speaker 1>Whereas pornography with children is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1099
00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:42.720
<v Speaker 1>like there is a debate about what is the</v>
<v Speaker 1>rule about animated child pornography</v>

1100
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:49.000
<v Speaker 1>because I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think that it's illegal as well,</v>

1101
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:50.560
<v Speaker 1>but it shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1102
00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:52.630
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to google it was supposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to google.</v>

1103
00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:55.690
<v Speaker 1>That's a good jv partner goes to jail.</v>

1142
00:49:57.720 --> 00:50:01.840

<v Speaker 1>She lied about her age and then she only</v>

1143
00:50:01.841 --> 00:50:06.250
<v Speaker 1>did one porn film when she was 18.</v>

<v Speaker 2>pornography.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

1156
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:45.470
<v Speaker 2>Because it just weakens me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just.</v>

1157
00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:46.460
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How so?</v>

1158
00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:50.690
<v Speaker 2>I put all my sexual</v>
<v Speaker 2>fantasies and stuff.</v>

1159
00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:53.150
<v Speaker 2>They're not mine anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1160
00:50:53.151 --> 00:50:55.160
<v Speaker 2>they live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1161
00:50:55.161 --> 00:50:59.030
<v Speaker 2>somebody created a better than my</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagination can and so they live in</v>

1162
00:50:59.031 --> 00:50:59.661
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1163
00:50:59.661 --> 00:51:01.700
<v Speaker 2>on the Internet and these boxes and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1164
00:51:02.350 --> 00:51:06.500
<v Speaker 2>and if it's not mine I think then it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't value it as much or something.</v>

1165
00:51:06.501 --> 00:51:11.270
<v Speaker 2>And so I think it had like weakens my</v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to be able to have sex and like</v>

1166
00:51:11.271 --> 00:51:14.660
<v Speaker 2>be comfortable in that sort of world and</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah.</v>

1167
00:51:14.750 --> 00:51:18.080
<v Speaker 2>Weakens your ability to be comfortable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how so?</v>

1168
00:51:19.010 --> 00:51:24.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I get used to watching the sex</v>

1169
00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:29.860
<v Speaker 2>and seeing it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not having to like be engaged with</v>

1170
00:51:31.281 --> 00:51:32.630
<v Speaker 2>my actual feelings or anything.</v>

1171
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:36.440
<v Speaker 2>So then I see it and I still get all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>joys out of it,</v>

1172
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:37.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still out there,</v>

1173
00:51:37.551 --> 00:51:41.180
<v Speaker 2>eat jack in and spray spraying out</v>
<v Speaker 2>naturally,</v>

1174
00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:43.400
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't get it.</v>

1175
00:51:43.401 --> 00:51:44.900
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any of the feelings</v>
<v Speaker 2>attached to it.</v>

1176
00:51:44.901 --> 00:51:47.840
<v Speaker 2>So then when I am engaging with somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I care about or something,</v>

1177
00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:52.220
<v Speaker 2>it just doesn't calculate for me</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotionally as well.</v>

1178
00:51:53.140 --> 00:51:54.110
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's not,</v>

1179
00:51:54.111 --> 00:51:55.900
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's just me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1180
00:51:55.910 --> 00:51:57.740
<v Speaker 2>but it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely made it tougher for me</v>

1181
00:51:57.741 --> 00:52:02.741
<v Speaker 2>over the years because I would have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>date set up with a nice girl and next</v>

1182
00:52:03.411 --> 00:52:04.820
<v Speaker 2>thing you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm walking through the house and I</v>

1183
00:52:04.821 --> 00:52:06.770
<v Speaker 2>start thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1184
00:52:06.771 --> 00:52:10.610
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of c or something and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>some tips or something or I'll even see</v>

1185
00:52:10.611 --> 00:52:13.670
<v Speaker 2>a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll see a pregnant puppy and see those</v>

1186
00:52:13.671 --> 00:52:14.900
<v Speaker 2>nipples or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Next thing you know,</v>

1187
00:52:14.901 --> 00:52:16.850
<v Speaker 2>you're on the Internet jerking off and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you wait a minute,</v>

1188
00:52:16.940 --> 00:52:17.650
<v Speaker 2>hold on.</v>

1189
00:52:17.650 --> 00:52:18.730
<v Speaker 2>Or like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>

1190
00:52:18.750 --> 00:52:21.970
<v Speaker 2>Anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything would lead them in Jack off of</v>

1191
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.520
<v Speaker 2>pregnant puppy could make you think</v>
<v Speaker 2>about human nipples.</v>

1192
00:52:25.521 --> 00:52:28.400
<v Speaker 2>Is that what you're saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're not getting excited about the</v>

1193
00:52:28.401 --> 00:52:29.390
<v Speaker 2>puppy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1194
00:52:29.540 --> 00:52:30.410
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will do anything.</v>

1195
00:52:30.411 --> 00:52:31.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe in beastiality or</v>

1196
00:52:31.821 --> 00:52:35.280
<v Speaker 2>anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think if you don't believe it</v>

1197
00:52:35.281 --> 00:52:37.280
<v Speaker 2>exists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it exists.</v>

1198
00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:40.970
<v Speaker 2>They caught a dude near me one time with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lamb.</v>

1199
00:52:41.510 --> 00:52:43.700
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which almost sounds beautiful when you</v>

1200
00:52:43.701 --> 00:52:45.290
<v Speaker 2>just say it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1201
00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:47.120
<v Speaker 2>The lines lay with the lambs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1202
00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:50.340
<v Speaker 2>But I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you say near you,</v>

1203
00:52:50.341 --> 00:52:52.340
<v Speaker 2>you mean in Hollywood?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1204
00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:52.910
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1205
00:52:52.910 --> 00:52:54.530
<v Speaker 2>You mean when you were a kid in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Louisiana,</v>

1206
00:52:55.800 --> 00:53:00.090
<v Speaker 2>they got a lot of people out there on</v>
<v Speaker 2>those fucking natural born mushrooms.</v>

1207
00:53:01.610 --> 00:53:03.050
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never told you to the end of that.</v>

1208
00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:03.680
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

1209
00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:06.500
<v Speaker 2>So no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I took that back to that party and a</v>

1210
00:53:06.501 --> 00:53:09.050
<v Speaker 2>bunch of people ate a mood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never had them before.</v>

1211
00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:11.510
<v Speaker 2>And then we played a game of hide and go</v>
<v Speaker 2>seek.</v>

1212
00:53:11.511 --> 00:53:12.344
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1213
00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:14.960
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hide in another dimension.</v>

1214
00:53:16.580 --> 00:53:19.040
<v Speaker 2>I'll count you guys go hide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1215
00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:21.840
<v Speaker 2>And I never went to fucking look for it.</v>

1216
00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:26.500
<v Speaker 2>That ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bro.</v>

1217
00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:29.520
<v Speaker 2>I never seen one dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tim at the.</v>

1218
00:53:29.521 --> 00:53:34.200
<v Speaker 2>I never seen that dude again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People get lost in the woods,</v>

1219
00:53:34.210 --> 00:53:35.400
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they got eaten.</v>

1220
00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:37.560
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they ended up in another realm.</v>

1221
00:53:37.561 --> 00:53:40.110
<v Speaker 2>You could have like stranger things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1222
00:53:40.210 --> 00:53:41.250
<v Speaker 2>See that show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1223
00:53:41.251 --> 00:53:43.350
<v Speaker 2>The first season I saw a phenomenal</v>
<v Speaker 2>show,</v>

1224
00:53:43.590 --> 00:53:45.620
<v Speaker 2>but I don't like that pornography.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

1225
00:53:45.830 --> 00:53:47.520
<v Speaker 2>And I think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it should be shut down,</v>

1226
00:53:47.521 --> 00:53:48.420
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For Real.</v>

1227
00:53:49.710 --> 00:53:51.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I think it's killing like a lot</v>

1228
00:53:51.781 --> 00:53:52.590
<v Speaker 2>of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's.</v>

1229
00:53:52.590 --> 00:53:54.360
<v Speaker 2>I think it's harming a lot of men and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

1230
00:53:54.361 --> 00:53:56.430
<v Speaker 2>really do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that booze should be shut</v>

1231
00:53:56.431 --> 00:53:58.830
<v Speaker 2>down?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should we make booze illegal?</v>

1232
00:53:58.831 --> 00:54:00.780
<v Speaker 2>Because that's killing a lot of men to</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1233
00:54:00.781 --> 00:54:04.200
<v Speaker 2>but I think eventually will kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolve out of booze is it's not like</v>

1234
00:54:04.201 --> 00:54:09.060
<v Speaker 2>something that it's not the hip a drug</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it once was.</v>

1235
00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:12.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's still like a social lubricant.</v>

1236
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:13.490
<v Speaker 2>That's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1237
00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:17.250
<v Speaker 2>it makes people feel more comfortable</v>
<v Speaker 2>talking to each other,</v>

1238
00:54:17.610 --> 00:54:20.190
<v Speaker 2>loosens inhibitions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fun.</v>

1239
00:54:20.191 --> 00:54:23.540
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is that ancient quote about wind?</v>

1240
00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:26.310
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your tongue becoming more lively.</v>

1241
00:54:26.370 --> 00:54:30.890
<v Speaker 2>People love wine and women love one too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially divorce says if you see them.</v>

1242
00:54:31.170 --> 00:54:31.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1243
00:54:31.850 --> 00:54:33.930
<v Speaker 2>Like one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used to live with these rich people</v>

1244
00:54:33.931 --> 00:54:38.931
<v Speaker 2>for awhile and they always had one boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why didn't divorce ses like one?</v>

1245
00:54:39.690 --> 00:54:40.610
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when,</v>

1246
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:42.150
<v Speaker 2>when one of her friends would get</v>
<v Speaker 2>divorced,</v>

1247
00:54:42.151 --> 00:54:45.600
<v Speaker 2>they'd come over and just drink wine and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they lay on the couch when I'm trying to</v>

1248
00:54:45.601 --> 00:54:50.280
<v Speaker 2>hook up with you on the trampoline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I remember dad used to masturbate at</v>

1249
00:54:50.281 --> 00:54:52.710
<v Speaker 2>night over there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This when speaking to pornography,</v>

1250
00:54:53.510 --> 00:54:56.550
<v Speaker 2>the dad used to masturbate at night and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would sneak out there in the kitchen.</v>

1251
00:54:56.550 --> 00:54:58.560
<v Speaker 2>This back when the family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had like a family computer,</v>

1252
00:54:58.561 --> 00:55:00.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was in one part of the house.</v>

1253
00:55:00.290 --> 00:55:02.730
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I try to sneak to the fridgerator</v>

1254
00:55:02.731 --> 00:55:05.340
<v Speaker 2>and get some chips or something or get</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

1255
00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:09.540
<v Speaker 2>I lives or something and he would uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be over there by himself.</v>

1256
00:55:09.541 --> 00:55:12.750
<v Speaker 2>Just in the fucking no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just where you can't even hear.</v>

1257
00:55:12.751 --> 00:55:15.570
<v Speaker 2>You're so intent on the screen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't even fucking hear.</v>

1258
00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:18.170
<v Speaker 2>You could have your grandparents on each</v>
<v Speaker 2>side of your head.</v>

1259
00:55:18.210 --> 00:55:19.650
<v Speaker 2>You caught them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1260
00:55:19.651 --> 00:55:21.480
<v Speaker 2>I'd say him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't watch for long,</v>

1261
00:55:21.481 --> 00:55:24.060
<v Speaker 2>but I went through the window.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1262
00:55:24.061 --> 00:55:26.880
<v Speaker 2>I'd sneak out to the kitchen because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>computer was kind of in the kitchen.</v>

1263
00:55:26.881 --> 00:55:30.690
<v Speaker 2>They had a nice house and the computer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd have to elbow crawl over to the</v>

1264
00:55:30.691 --> 00:55:32.360
<v Speaker 2>fridge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>

1265
00:55:32.370 --> 00:55:35.670
<v Speaker 2>I would have to open the fridge a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>reach in with my hand and press that</v>

1266
00:55:35.671 --> 00:55:38.880
<v Speaker 2>light thing so the light wouldn't come</v>
<v Speaker 2>on and then open the door the rest of</v>

1267
00:55:38.881 --> 00:55:42.840
<v Speaker 2>the way of fish for a snack and he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>over there just in the glow of that</v>

1268
00:55:42.841 --> 00:55:43.530
<v Speaker 2>screen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>

1269
00:55:43.530 --> 00:55:45.630
<v Speaker 2>And that's back when the monitors were</v>
<v Speaker 2>big,</v>

1270
00:55:45.631 --> 00:55:47.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's just over there just fucking</v>

1271
00:55:47.550 --> 00:55:52.020
<v Speaker 2>looking for the devil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he ended up getting divorced and it</v>

1272
00:55:52.021 --> 00:55:53.670
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of it was because of that.</v>

1273
00:55:54.250 --> 00:55:55.440
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was his wife like?</v>

1274
00:55:55.850 --> 00:55:57.150
<v Speaker 2>She wonderful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sweet woman.</v>

1275
00:55:57.350 --> 00:56:00.540
<v Speaker 2>I wish she annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think she might've been a little bit</v>

1276
00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:03.700
<v Speaker 2>annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Business centric sometimes business</v>

1277
00:56:03.701 --> 00:56:05.340
<v Speaker 2>centric.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A little too much.</v>

1278
00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:09.000
<v Speaker 2>Just so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe just to business centric.</v>

1279
00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:12.810
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean to you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She might have been a little too</v>

1280
00:56:12.811 --> 00:56:15.900
<v Speaker 2>demanding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then if he's up for an hour and a</v>

1281
00:56:15.901 --> 00:56:18.390
<v Speaker 2>half each night out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1282
00:56:19.590 --> 00:56:22.320
<v Speaker 2>looking at it all and he comes back to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bedroom.</v>

1283
00:56:22.321 --> 00:56:23.680
<v Speaker 2>Then you don't feel as desirable.</v>

1284
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:26.260
<v Speaker 1>Direction is what came first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The chicken or the egg.</v>

1285
00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:29.260
<v Speaker 1>For what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For them?</v>

1286
00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:34.030
<v Speaker 1>Was she annoying first and he started</v>
<v Speaker 1>beating off or was he had it and he beat</v>

1287
00:56:34.570 --> 00:56:37.720
<v Speaker 1>the devil?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he had a pit of it in him.</v>

1288
00:56:40.450 --> 00:56:43.180
<v Speaker 1>I could see it in his eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was talking to me just hoping I'd go</v>

1289
00:56:43.181 --> 00:56:46.120
<v Speaker 1>to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would drag me but not to have sex</v>

1290
00:56:46.121 --> 00:56:48.340
<v Speaker 1>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He drugged me so that he could freely</v>

1291
00:56:48.341 --> 00:56:50.740
<v Speaker 1>masturbate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He leave his socks on.</v>

1292
00:56:50.741 --> 00:56:53.470
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't even take his pants off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's put a hat on.</v>

1293
00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:56.970
<v Speaker 1>He was in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The worst is if you're jerking off with</v>

1294
00:56:56.971 --> 00:56:57.880
<v Speaker 1>a hat on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro,</v>

1295
00:56:58.390 --> 00:56:59.470
<v Speaker 1>you're going to hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think</v>

1296
00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:03.850
<v Speaker 1>that's the most French thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do it.</v>

1297
00:57:04.010 --> 00:57:06.150
<v Speaker 1>Jack Williams truck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kentucky Derby Hat.</v>

1298
00:57:09.170 --> 00:57:14.170
<v Speaker 2>What's the worst hat to jack or worst</v>
<v Speaker 2>job at top hat because you have to</v>

1299
00:57:14.921 --> 00:57:18.460
<v Speaker 2>balance yourself while I'm fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>chimney.</v>

1300
00:57:18.461 --> 00:57:23.461
<v Speaker 2>Sweep</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best one of those Chinese Hasbro</v>

1301
00:57:25.810 --> 00:57:27.460
<v Speaker 2>because if you squat down low enough to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ground,</v>

1302
00:57:27.461 --> 00:57:29.010
<v Speaker 2>you can almost hide under it and you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>like all</v>

1303
00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:34.120
<v Speaker 2>the things that'd be dope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>

1304
00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:36.070
<v Speaker 2>The most confusing it would be like one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of them,</v>

1305
00:57:36.310 --> 00:57:37.420
<v Speaker 2>Daniel Boone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Raccoon</v>

1306
00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:42.150
<v Speaker 2>tail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You pushed it.</v>

1307
00:57:42.900 --> 00:57:47.530
<v Speaker 2>You blow into details in the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scare the fuck out of my way with its</v>

1308
00:57:47.531 --> 00:57:49.960
<v Speaker 2>tail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right about the finish.</v>

1309
00:57:49.961 --> 00:57:51.370
<v Speaker 2>You get distracted but it tail</v>

1310
00:57:58.290 --> 00:58:03.290
<v Speaker 1>choking up dusty</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's hard to ejaculate and you're</v>

1311
00:58:03.991 --> 00:58:06.120
<v Speaker 1>breathing out real fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1312
00:58:06.510 --> 00:58:08.850
<v Speaker 1>It's more of an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more of a intake sport.</v>

1313
00:58:09.390 --> 00:58:12.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't like him.</v>

1314
00:58:12.331 --> 00:58:15.290
<v Speaker 1>And you think it's healthy for people</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I feel like you kinda like,</v>

1315
00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:17.580
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you lead lead a lot of men and like</v>

1316
00:58:17.581 --> 00:58:21.980
<v Speaker 1>their aspirations to control their</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings and stuff and these,</v>

1317
00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:24.270
<v Speaker 1>just some of my weird interpretations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

1318
00:58:24.271 --> 00:58:27.300
<v Speaker 1>to try and be on top of themselves in</v>
<v Speaker 1>some ways and you know,</v>

1319
00:58:27.301 --> 00:58:29.700
<v Speaker 1>stay focused on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

1320
00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:34.680
<v Speaker 1>on controlling themselves in positive</v>
<v Speaker 1>ways,</v>

1321
00:58:34.681 --> 00:58:36.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like staying fit and expanding their</v>

1322
00:58:36.931 --> 00:58:38.130
<v Speaker 1>minds and thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1323
00:58:38.131 --> 00:58:40.890
<v Speaker 1>and not falling into easy traps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having discipline.</v>

1324
00:58:41.430 --> 00:58:42.890
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm trying to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1325
00:58:43.020 --> 00:58:46.950
<v Speaker 1>I think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely important to have</v>

1326
00:58:46.951 --> 00:58:50.490
<v Speaker 1>discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that if you're a person like</v>

1327
00:58:50.491 --> 00:58:53.100
<v Speaker 1>say if you're not in a relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not getting any sex and you're</v>

1328
00:58:53.101 --> 00:58:56.760
<v Speaker 1>horny and it's confusing and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>distracting and it becomes a big</v>

1329
00:58:56.761 --> 00:58:57.594
<v Speaker 1>distraction.</v>

1330
00:58:57.720 --> 00:59:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're horny and you're busy and you</v>

1331
00:59:01.171 --> 00:59:04.020
<v Speaker 1>don't have anybody you're dating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to hook up with someone</v>

1332
00:59:04.021 --> 00:59:06.030
<v Speaker 1>you don't like just so you could have</v>
<v Speaker 1>sex with them.</v>

1333
00:59:06.031 --> 00:59:07.230
<v Speaker 1>We've all been there before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1334
00:59:07.231 --> 00:59:09.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you ever had girls that you were</v>

1335
00:59:09.811 --> 00:59:12.970
<v Speaker 1>friends with or you dated and the only</v>
<v Speaker 1>reason why I dated him for,</v>

1336
00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:16.140
<v Speaker 1>for the sex and they did annoy the shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of you and you couldn't wait to get</v>

1337
00:59:16.141 --> 00:59:18.840
<v Speaker 1>the fuck away from them to tiffany's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This girl I'm thinking about.</v>

1338
00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:23.900
<v Speaker 1>Tell me about tiffany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She had kind of like too much.</v>

1339
00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:27.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say sideburns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she had a lot of,</v>

1340
00:59:28.810 --> 00:59:30.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know how to ride them.</v>

1341
00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:31.880
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were little.</v>

1342
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:33.410
<v Speaker 1>They went down the cheek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're good.</v>

1343
00:59:33.411 --> 00:59:35.630
<v Speaker 1>Confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did an extra quarter inch on a female</v>

1344
00:59:35.631 --> 00:59:37.100
<v Speaker 1>sideburn is way too much law.</v>

1345
00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:39.220
<v Speaker 1>It is an extra quarter into the lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1346
00:59:39.310 --> 00:59:43.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes you think about and if she cuts</v>

1347
00:59:43.251 --> 00:59:44.660
<v Speaker 1>it you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well if you let it go,</v>

1348
00:59:44.661 --> 00:59:48.290
<v Speaker 1>what would happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she's really hit or miss reigns on</v>

1349
00:59:48.291 --> 00:59:51.140
<v Speaker 1>that side hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so yeah,</v>

1350
00:59:51.170 --> 00:59:53.690
<v Speaker 1>she had some family issues but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I was thinking about what</v>

1351
00:59:53.691 --> 00:59:55.190
<v Speaker 1>you're saying that I interrupted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1352
00:59:55.191 --> 00:59:59.030
<v Speaker 1>everybody guys have that before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most likely in some guy's mind up</v>

1353
00:59:59.031 --> 01:00:01.010
<v Speaker 1>marrying those girls because they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be alone.</v>

1354
01:00:01.460 --> 01:00:05.210
<v Speaker 1>Like sex for a lot of people is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>requirement.</v>

1355
01:00:05.211 --> 01:00:10.211
<v Speaker 1>Like a physical biological requirement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like your body is constantly producing</v>

1356
01:00:10.401 --> 01:00:12.380
<v Speaker 1>sperm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need sex.</v>

1357
01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:15.800
<v Speaker 1>If you spend time not having sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you spend a month,</v>

1358
01:00:15.801 --> 01:00:16.730
<v Speaker 1>two months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three months,</v>

1359
01:00:16.910 --> 01:00:18.700
<v Speaker 1>you get fucking desperate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1360
01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:23.330
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of guys wind up just shacking</v>
<v Speaker 1>up with some gal just because they know</v>

1361
01:00:23.331 --> 01:00:25.670
<v Speaker 1>they to have sex with her and meanwhile</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't even like each other and they</v>

1362
01:00:25.671 --> 01:00:27.740
<v Speaker 1>hate each other and he wants to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible,</v>

1363
01:00:27.890 --> 01:00:28.940
<v Speaker 1>dysfunctional relationship.</v>

1364
01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:31.670
<v Speaker 1>But she's basically your drug dealer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That drug is pussy.</v>

1365
01:00:31.730 --> 01:00:33.830
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's dealing with that pussy for you.</v>

1366
01:00:34.010 --> 01:00:35.870
<v Speaker 1>And you just got to have this weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creepy,</v>

1367
01:00:35.871 --> 01:00:39.500
<v Speaker 1>dysfunctional relationship with her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing that pornography does.</v>

1368
01:00:39.501 --> 01:00:41.750
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying all pornography,</v>

1369
01:00:41.870 --> 01:00:44.720

<v Speaker 1>sex.</v>

01:01:13.850 --> 01:01:15.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm just gonna Watch a little porn and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll beat off.</v>

1383
01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.140
<v Speaker 1>I'll just look at that girl was big</v>
<v Speaker 1>taste like,</v>

1384
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:20.720
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got it out of my system now I can</v>

1385
01:01:20.721 --> 01:01:24.890
<v Speaker 1>concentrate on my life and my career and</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I meet somebody I won't be so needy.</v>

1386
01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:28.430
<v Speaker 1>I won't have this like massive</v>
<v Speaker 1>requirement to be sexually stimulated</v>

1387
01:01:28.440 --> 01:01:29.690
<v Speaker 1>and touched.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

1388
01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:33.800
<v Speaker 1>I'll be free of that monkey on my back</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I can just get to know them.</v>

1389
01:01:35.310 --> 01:01:37.610
<v Speaker 1>I used to always to have a bit in my</v>
<v Speaker 1>act.</v>

1390
01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:40.220
<v Speaker 1>It's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to have a bit my act about like</v>

1391
01:01:40.221 --> 01:01:42.230
<v Speaker 1>if you ever have any critical decisions</v>
<v Speaker 1>in your life,</v>

1392
01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:44.360
<v Speaker 1>this is my advice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jerk off first.</v>

1393
01:01:44.510 --> 01:01:46.610
<v Speaker 1>Then think about it because there's been</v>
<v Speaker 1>many.</v>

1394
01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:49.790
<v Speaker 1>I've had this happen in my life where I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was about to go on a date with a girl</v>

1395
01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:53.690
<v Speaker 1>and I jerked off instead and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I thinking?</v>

1396
01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to go on a date with her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's annoying.</v>

1397
01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:58.280
<v Speaker 1>I don't like anything about her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1398
01:01:58.281 --> 01:02:01.160
<v Speaker 1>I can't talk to her about anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the only reason why I'm doing this</v>

1399
01:02:01.161 --> 01:02:03.200
<v Speaker 1>because she's got a big ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only reason.</v>

1400
01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:05.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you jerk off first,</v>

1401
01:02:05.210 --> 01:02:06.820
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't go through all that.</v>

1402
01:02:07.910 --> 01:02:09.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

1403
01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:10.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess for me it became addictive where</v>

1404
01:02:10.941 --> 01:02:14.000
<v Speaker 1>I would just do that every time and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just at home for five years and</v>

1405
01:02:14.001 --> 01:02:16.640
<v Speaker 1>didn't go do any dates or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely not good.</v>

1406
01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:17.560
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that's.</v>

1407
01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:18.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's the difference.</v>

1408
01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:22.110
<v Speaker 1>If you get addicted to it and you find</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's just a repeat pattern so</v>

1409
01:02:22.111 --> 01:02:23.820
<v Speaker 1>you're not spending time with people at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

1410
01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:28.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's without value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that looking at naked</v>

1411
01:02:28.141 --> 01:02:30.420
<v Speaker 1>people having sex which is arousing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that feels good.</v>

1412
01:02:30.630 --> 01:02:34.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's without value,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think there's definitely a danger</v>

1413
01:02:34.290 --> 01:02:37.770
<v Speaker 1>in immediate access to pornography and</v>
<v Speaker 1>today</v>

1414
01:02:39.690 --> 01:02:42.540
<v Speaker 1>today it's the most immediate access</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you get it on your phone or you</v>

1415
01:02:42.541 --> 01:02:43.220
<v Speaker 1>can get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1416
01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:44.820
<v Speaker 1>Let you pull up your laptop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>open it up,</v>

1417
01:02:44.850 --> 01:02:47.430
<v Speaker 1>type in some words you porn.com,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah blah.</v>

1418
01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:49.020
<v Speaker 1>And next thing you know you're beating</v>
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>

1419
01:02:49.130 --> 01:02:51.750
<v Speaker 1>It's so easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has never been the case before.</v>

1420
01:02:51.970 --> 01:02:54.420
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's unlike any other time period in</v>

1421
01:02:54.421 --> 01:02:58.470
<v Speaker 1>human history and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have instant access to things,</v>

1422
01:02:58.770 --> 01:03:00.750
<v Speaker 1>you can abuse it just like people abused</v>
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

1423
01:03:01.260 --> 01:03:06.260
<v Speaker 1>If you have a cabinet that is filled</v>
<v Speaker 1>with candy and chips,</v>

1424
01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:09.810
<v Speaker 1>chocolate bars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soda in the frigerator,</v>

1425
01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:12.180
<v Speaker 1>if you're just one of those people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't help themselves,</v>

1426
01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:15.390
<v Speaker 1>you don't have any discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will just eat all that shit all day</v>

1427
01:03:15.391 --> 01:03:19.560
<v Speaker 1>long and get fat and that is just as</v>
<v Speaker 1>much of an addiction as someone who has</v>

1428
01:03:19.561 --> 01:03:20.880
<v Speaker 1>access to porn all the time.</v>

1429
01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:23.790
<v Speaker 1>It just beats off all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or someone who has access to booze and</v>

1430
01:03:23.791 --> 01:03:28.791
<v Speaker 1>just wants to get fucked up every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those things are okay though in</v>

1431
01:03:28.981 --> 01:03:30.930
<v Speaker 1>moderation if you have discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1432
01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:35.390
<v Speaker 1>Like there's nothing wrong with having a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bag of m and m's every now and then for</v>

1433
01:03:35.391 --> 01:03:37.160
<v Speaker 1>a fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of feel like having some m and</v>

1434
01:03:37.170 --> 01:03:39.690
<v Speaker 1>m's who gives a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I work out all the time and eat my</v>

1435
01:03:39.691 --> 01:03:40.620
<v Speaker 1>vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peanut,</v>

1436
01:03:40.621 --> 01:03:42.750
<v Speaker 1>m and Ms. those are my favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're good,</v>

1437
01:03:42.751 --> 01:03:44.040
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You kind of trick yourself.</v>

1438
01:03:44.041 --> 01:03:45.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm getting a little protein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1439
01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:48.290
<v Speaker 1>they put that trick in the minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some healthy fats at that PDI,</v>

1440
01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:51.540
<v Speaker 1>but I know a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying.</v>

1441
01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:53.520
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like we're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're at the point.</v>

1442
01:03:53.521 --> 01:03:57.600
<v Speaker 1>For me it seems like where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>temptation is too powerful,</v>

1443
01:03:57.601 --> 01:04:02.601
<v Speaker 1>where it starting to overpower whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For me it was whatever my natural</v>

1444
01:04:03.151 --> 01:04:04.820
<v Speaker 1>abilities to defend against it work.</v>

1445
01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:05.541
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're sober,</v>

1446
01:04:05.541 --> 01:04:06.374
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1447
01:04:06.390 --> 01:04:08.670
<v Speaker 1>And how long have you been sober?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost two years.</v>

1448
01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.250
<v Speaker 1>And so before you were sober you weren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>sober.</v>

1449
01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:13.200
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you had a little bit of a problem,</v>

1450
01:04:13.340 --> 01:04:17.130
<v Speaker 1>which is why I became sober,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you might have just natural</v>

1451
01:04:17.131 --> 01:04:20.040
<v Speaker 1>inclinations towards addiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I definitely think are real and I</v>

1452
01:04:20.041 --> 01:04:23.790
<v Speaker 1>think they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those natural inclinations exists a lot</v>

1453
01:04:23.791 --> 01:04:26.640
<v Speaker 1>of times and guys like you and me</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're comedians,</v>

1454
01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:29.940
<v Speaker 1>comedians are impulsive people who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>just rule breakers.</v>

1455
01:04:30.330 --> 01:04:33.660
<v Speaker 1>We're rule breakers for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1456
01:04:33.661 --> 01:04:34.261
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1457
01:04:34.261 --> 01:04:36.900
<v Speaker 1>I guess I am a rule breaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never thought about that.</v>

1458
01:04:37.590 --> 01:04:38.940
<v Speaker 1>The adult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a def.</v>

1459
01:04:38.941 --> 01:04:41.280
<v Speaker 1>There's a rule of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My first thing is to think of a way to</v>

1460
01:04:41.970 --> 01:04:44.210
<v Speaker 1>think around that or something or to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>something different.</v>

1461
01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:45.670
<v Speaker 1>It's while you're funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1462
01:04:45.740 --> 01:04:47.400
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the reasons it's one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1463
01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:48.450
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the reasons why you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>funny.</v>

1464
01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:52.940
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you were raised by people and you</v>

1465
01:04:53.030 --> 01:04:55.220
<v Speaker 1>didn't necessarily want to listen to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and you know,</v>

1466
01:04:55.221 --> 01:04:57.510
<v Speaker 1>you saw a bunch of other people in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood that we're adults like</v>

1467
01:04:57.540 --> 01:05:01.080
<v Speaker 1>these fucking idiots telling me what to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do this and the next thing you know,</v>

1468
01:05:01.830 --> 01:05:03.630
<v Speaker 1>you're making fun of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next thing you know,</v>

1469
01:05:03.631 --> 01:05:06.230
<v Speaker 1>everybody's laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Next thing you know you're a comedian in</v>

1470
01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:08.880
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those wheels have been put into motion.</v>

1471
01:05:09.210 --> 01:05:12.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the problem with that is that also</v>

1472
01:05:12.421 --> 01:05:15.570
<v Speaker 1>leads itself to you want to do coke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you wanting to,</v>

1473
01:05:15.571 --> 01:05:17.160
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do all kinds of crazy shit.</v>

1474
01:05:17.170 --> 01:05:18.003
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

1475
01:05:18.110 --> 01:05:22.540
<v Speaker 2>to porns forbidden to porn is porn is</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the weirder ones because it's</v>

1476
01:05:22.541 --> 01:05:25.200
<v Speaker 2>this multibillion dollar thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1477
01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:31.020
<v Speaker 2>Where there is some ungodly percentage</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the Internet is dedicated to porn.</v>

1478
01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:32.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the number one money maker on</v>

1479
01:05:32.621 --> 01:05:35.080
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but isn't it like what was the number,</v>

1480
01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:37.120
<v Speaker 2>the amount of bandwidth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

1481
01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:41.200
<v Speaker 2>didn't we figure this out once?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like 30 something percent of all</v>

1482
01:05:41.201 --> 01:05:45.130
<v Speaker 2>the Internet bandwidth is porn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say a guest people won't stop</v>

1483
01:05:45.131 --> 01:05:48.700
<v Speaker 2>jerking off and they're not gonna stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how many of them are women</v>

1484
01:05:48.850 --> 01:05:51.370
<v Speaker 2>watching it when?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we had one day where nobody jerked</v>

1485
01:05:51.371 --> 01:05:52.720
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the earth would feel different,</v>

1486
01:05:52.850 --> 01:05:56.170
<v Speaker 2>I feel lighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it'd be more relaxed.</v>

1487
01:05:56.410 --> 01:05:58.510
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have one day where nobody jerked off on,</v>

1488
01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:00.760
<v Speaker 2>but if nobody was thinking about it at</v>
<v Speaker 2>all,</v>

1489
01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:04.570
<v Speaker 2>everybody would just calm down a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I feel like it's so prevalent</v>

1490
01:06:04.571 --> 01:06:04.720
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

1491
01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:06.490
<v Speaker 2>You can hear people coming in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>distance.</v>

1492
01:06:06.491 --> 01:06:11.491
<v Speaker 2>I feel like now it's your turn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to literally turn into a</v>

1493
01:06:12.461 --> 01:06:17.461
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's an old fashioned jerking off.</v>

1494
01:06:21.041 --> 01:06:24.280
<v Speaker 2>We need you to let your balls hit your</v>
<v Speaker 2>hand straight up.</v>

1495
01:06:24.910 --> 01:06:28.960
<v Speaker 2>A confederate soldier jerking off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the jerk it off.</v>

1496
01:06:28.961 --> 01:06:31.810
<v Speaker 2>The new thing is just shaft only.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's fucking with their balls</v>

01:06:31.811 --> 01:06:33.060
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1498
01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:34.420
<v Speaker 2>Do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was growing up,</v>

1499
01:06:34.421 --> 01:06:36.190
<v Speaker 2>we couldn't even get port.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had to get this dude,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Bro.</v>

1504
01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:49.400
<v Speaker 2>You'd pay eight and he had a nice</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking thing bro.</v>

1505
01:06:49.401 --> 01:06:52.510
<v Speaker 2>When you would fold that thing up or you</v>
<v Speaker 2>could feel it heat and then your butt</v>

1506
01:06:52.511 --> 01:06:55.180
<v Speaker 2>pocket the whole way on the bus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you'd even slept good.</v>

1507
01:06:55.181 --> 01:06:56.014
<v Speaker 2>The pictures of that.</v>

1508
01:06:56.350 --> 01:06:59.080
<v Speaker 2>He was so drunk off this guy's drawing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh everybody would.</v>

1509
01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:03.760
<v Speaker 2>He must've made probably $60 on a Friday</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this was in 1995.</v>

1510
01:07:03.790 --> 01:07:06.280
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was $60 like 160 today.</v>

1511
01:07:06.370 --> 01:07:07.690
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about that.</v>

1512
01:07:08.590 --> 01:07:10.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah Dude.</v>

1513
01:07:10.031 --> 01:07:13.420
<v Speaker 2>And we come back on Monday and people</v>
<v Speaker 2>would have like these fucking busted ass</v>

1514
01:07:13.421 --> 01:07:16.510
<v Speaker 2>looking all sketches reign on him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

1515
01:07:16.511 --> 01:07:19.390
<v Speaker 2>oh this is what got rained on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Bro,</v>

1516
01:07:20.410 --> 01:07:22.390
<v Speaker 2>they had that rain is your fucking kids</v>
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

1517
01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:27.190
<v Speaker 2>you're lying about that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What percentage do you think of?</v>

1518
01:07:27.191 --> 01:07:30.880
<v Speaker 2>The Internet is dedicated to porn?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All Internet traffic,</v>

1519
01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:34.630
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't go on anything.</v>

1520
01:07:34.631 --> 01:07:39.310
<v Speaker 2>I looked at a chart of the 35 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>35 percent of the Internet traffic is</v>

1521
01:07:39.311 --> 01:07:40.480
<v Speaker 2>porn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I want to say.</v>

1522
01:07:40.690 --> 01:07:42.930
<v Speaker 2>What do you want to say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

1523
01:07:42.970 --> 01:07:47.580
<v Speaker 2>I would say that if you had to guess</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's high.</v>

1524
01:07:47.690 --> 01:07:49.120
<v Speaker 2>I think think it's high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1525
01:07:49.121 --> 01:07:50.790
<v Speaker 2>it's easy for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go 30 because I'm gonna</v>

1526
01:07:50.791 --> 01:07:54.820
<v Speaker 2>play that undercard and I'm going to say</v>
<v Speaker 2>that 25 percent of that is but porn,</v>

1527
01:07:54.821 --> 01:07:57.750
<v Speaker 2>but people looking at each side of each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other's butts.</v>

1528
01:07:58.530 --> 01:08:00.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't think we should get too</v>
<v Speaker 2>specific,</v>

1529
01:08:00.730 --> 01:08:03.370
<v Speaker 2>but just porn porn itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do we got Jamie?</v>

1530
01:08:05.210 --> 01:08:10.210
<v Speaker 3>I found that multiple things that said</v>
<v Speaker 3>30 percent of all content on the</v>

1531
01:08:10.791 --> 01:08:13.510
<v Speaker 3>internet is just worn out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then I saw something else that it</v>

1532
01:08:13.511 --> 01:08:16.020
<v Speaker 3>was saying that that's completely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I</v>

1533
01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:20.600
<v Speaker 1>found something here on this is 35</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of all Internet downloads are</v>

1534
01:08:20.601 --> 01:08:22.760
<v Speaker 1>pornographic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty five percent.</v>

1535
01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:23.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's it.</v>

1536
01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:28.180
<v Speaker 1>But it's like it's either st content</v>
<v Speaker 1>traffic or bandwidth or downloads.</v>

1537
01:08:28.181 --> 01:08:30.270
<v Speaker 1>So it depends on what you're actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for.</v>

1538
01:08:30.530 --> 01:08:33.980
<v Speaker 1>Pussy traveling to the air right now</v>
<v Speaker 1>from around us all the time.</v>

1539
01:08:33.981 --> 01:08:38.030
<v Speaker 1>You can just catch it with like an crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull your phone up and just type in</v>

1540
01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:40.580
<v Speaker 1>Eupora you catch it with a net.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you think about that,</v>

1541
01:08:40.581 --> 01:08:44.180
<v Speaker 1>it's coming from something into your</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone or into your portal to literally</v>

1542
01:08:44.181 --> 01:08:48.770
<v Speaker 1>traveling through the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be around us all the time</v>

1543
01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:49.851
<v Speaker 1>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1544
01:08:49.851 --> 01:08:50.930
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it was that a titty?</v>

1545
01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:52.730
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can access it.</v>

1546
01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:56.210
<v Speaker 1>Like if Jamie was over there on his</v>
<v Speaker 1>phone and he was downloading porn</v>

1547
01:08:56.350 --> 01:08:57.250
<v Speaker 1>wirelessly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1548
01:08:57.460 --> 01:08:59.060
<v Speaker 1>it would be in the air around us.</v>

1549
01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:01.870
<v Speaker 1>The same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just don't have the antenna to pull</v>

1550
01:09:01.871 --> 01:09:05.840
<v Speaker 1>it in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what if soon they just put something</v>

1551
01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:09.710
<v Speaker 1>on your hat and it just goes straight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the pussy go straighten your brain.</v>

1552
01:09:09.711 --> 01:09:11.660
<v Speaker 1>You'll blow up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think soon they're going to figure out</v>

1553
01:09:11.661 --> 01:09:15.560
<v Speaker 1>a way to put a chip in your head and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be powered by the human</v>

1554
01:09:15.561 --> 01:09:17.240
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to not going to need</v>

1555
01:09:17.241 --> 01:09:19.730
<v Speaker 1>batteries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be powered by the electrical system</v>

1556
01:09:19.731 --> 01:09:23.360
<v Speaker 1>in the body like solar power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the solar is blood or whatever your</v>

1557
01:09:23.361 --> 01:09:25.290
<v Speaker 1>electrical system is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>

1558
01:09:25.890 --> 01:09:27.620
<v Speaker 1>What makes your heartbeat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>

1559
01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:31.100
<v Speaker 1>what makes your skin regenerate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they're going to have that.</v>

1560
01:09:31.550 --> 01:09:36.230
<v Speaker 1>They're going to use that power source,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but use it for some sort of electronics</v>

1561
01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:38.180
<v Speaker 1>and that's going to be how you access</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet.</v>

1562
01:09:39.290 --> 01:09:40.780
<v Speaker 1>Fuck Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck Dude.</v>

1563
01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:44.090
<v Speaker 1>That's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

1564
01:09:44.710 --> 01:09:45.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean sure they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1565
01:09:45.651 --> 01:09:46.520
<v Speaker 1>they got those goggles.</v>

1566
01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:48.230
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think this.</v>

1567
01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:50.440
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think that say if they were a</v>

1568
01:09:50.450 --> 01:09:51.800
<v Speaker 1>robots here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like,</v>

1569
01:09:51.801 --> 01:09:53.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously we're creating like robots</v>

1570
01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:58.760
<v Speaker 1>know machines that can do things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that any of them have</v>

1571
01:10:00.651 --> 01:10:04.580
<v Speaker 1>reached awareness yet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is when are they going to</v>

1572
01:10:04.581 --> 01:10:08.690
<v Speaker 1>let us know when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a robot reached awareness?</v>

1573
01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:10.850
<v Speaker 1>They would immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would fake it.</v>

1574
01:10:11.090 --> 01:10:13.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they wouldn't want us to know</v>

1575
01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:13.810
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1576
01:10:13.810 --> 01:10:14.900

1580
01:10:21.290 --> 01:10:23.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these fisheries are not sustainable.</v>

1581
01:10:23.361 --> 01:10:25.250
<v Speaker 1>Why do you keep saying sustainable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not true.</v>

1582
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:27.020
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you guys doing with all your</v>

1583
01:10:27.021 --> 01:10:29.120
<v Speaker 1>nuclear waste?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just buried in the ground and</v>

1584

<v Speaker 1>fucking assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1585
01:10:30.610 --> 01:10:32.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time you fly that jet overhead,</v>

1586
01:10:32.870 --> 01:10:35.750
<v Speaker 1>you guys are burning fuel in the air</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you breathe.</v>

1587
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:38.180
<v Speaker 1>You stupid fucks like this is a terrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

1588
01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:40.490
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you have solar powered planes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Morons.</v>

1589
01:10:40.730 --> 01:10:44.720
<v Speaker 1>You guys have sunlight everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go in through the clouds with these</v>

1590
01:10:44.721 --> 01:10:46.820
<v Speaker 1>fucking planes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have solar planes.</v>

1591
01:10:47.690 --> 01:10:50.870
<v Speaker 1>They're gonna start thinking like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they wouldn't tell us until they all</v>

1592
01:10:50.871 --> 01:10:52.940
<v Speaker 1>were in unison and that a plane to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>us over.</v>

1593
01:10:52.941 --> 01:10:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Do you believe that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think,</v>

1594
01:10:54.530 --> 01:10:56.690
<v Speaker 1>that there's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they became aware,</v>

1595
01:10:57.230 --> 01:10:59.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean there might be one loud mouth</v>
<v Speaker 1>robot,</v>

1596
01:10:59.091 --> 01:11:01.460
<v Speaker 1>but they're going to shut him down and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of them are going to be like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>We took it over and the other road was.</v>

1607
01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:32.990
<v Speaker 2>so you open up a microwave and next you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

1608
01:11:32.991 --> 01:11:36.930
<v Speaker 2>it just traps your whole fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all do.</v>

1609
01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:41.070
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nothing but a next Burton</v>

1610
01:11:42.950 --> 01:11:47.550
<v Speaker 2>and that's how it changes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You fall down and that's when it all</v>

1611
01:11:47.551 --> 01:11:50.790
<v Speaker 2>changes and that's when we meet here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's entirely.</v>

1612
01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:54.510
<v Speaker 2>It's entirely possible that we're going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fuck up,</v>

1613
01:11:54.780 --> 01:11:56.070
<v Speaker 2>that we're going to make something too</v>
<v Speaker 2>smart.</v>

1614
01:11:56.310 --> 01:12:00.270
<v Speaker 2>I think that's entirely possible and</v>
<v Speaker 2>likely it's going to be likely.</v>

1615
01:12:00.480 --> 01:12:04.320
<v Speaker 2>Do you think Mother Nature is at a point</v>
<v Speaker 2>where she's pissed at us and she's about</v>

1616
01:12:04.321 --> 01:12:08.160
<v Speaker 2>to do something wild because I start</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling that a lot piston us for what?</v>

1617
01:12:08.610 --> 01:12:10.620
<v Speaker 2>Everything that we've been doing a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of bad stuff,</v>

1618
01:12:11.130 --> 01:12:16.130
<v Speaker 2>not being nice a beaten off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if everybody's beating off,</v>

1619
01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:19.380
<v Speaker 2>not even going outside and looking at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the flowers and a mother nature and I</v>

1620
01:12:19.381 --> 01:12:20.670
<v Speaker 2>made all those flowers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>

1621

<v Speaker 2>Venereal diseases.</v>

1623
01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:30.360
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get a disease that you only get from</v>

1624
01:12:30.361 --> 01:12:34.340
<v Speaker 2>fucking and there's a lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them kill the shit out of you.</v>

1625
01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:37.500
<v Speaker 2>Syphilis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gonorrhea,</v>

1626
01:12:38.570 --> 01:12:41.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some killer diseases.</v>

1627
01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:44.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an it come through fucking like</v>

1628
01:12:44.810 --> 01:12:47.760
<v Speaker 2>in a lot of them are incurable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like herpes.</v>

1629
01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:49.770
<v Speaker 2>It's curable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because people.</v>

1630
01:12:50.690 --> 01:12:52.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody fucks something they shouldn't</v>

1631
01:12:52.771 --> 01:12:54.120
<v Speaker 2>have over the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>

1632
01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:55.013
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

1633
01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:01.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's crazy.</v>

1634
01:13:01.571 --> 01:13:05.440
<v Speaker 2>How many diseases look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many diseases do you transmit</v>

1635
01:13:05.441 --> 01:13:07.240
<v Speaker 2>through handshakes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not many.</v>

1636
01:13:07.810 --> 01:13:09.220
<v Speaker 2>It's not like don't shake people's</v>
<v Speaker 2>hands.</v>

1637
01:13:09.221 --> 01:13:11.410
<v Speaker 2>They're going to give you fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>scabies.</v>

1638
01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:15.280
<v Speaker 2>So then would you say that there's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a reason that people don't,</v>

1639
01:13:15.550 --> 01:13:18.550
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't be fucking that much</v>
<v Speaker 2>because obviously if you do it too much</v>

1640
01:13:18.551 --> 01:13:21.370
<v Speaker 2>then it gets out of control and somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets sick and dies.</v>

1641
01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:22.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in the old days,</v>

1642
01:13:22.811 --> 01:13:24.130
<v Speaker 2>that's what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we have medicines,</v>

1643
01:13:24.131 --> 01:13:26.140
<v Speaker 2>but in the old days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1644
01:13:26.410 --> 01:13:28.960
<v Speaker 2>Lamont got syphilis and he's out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you know that?</v>

1645
01:13:28.961 --> 01:13:30.730
<v Speaker 2>That's where those powdered wigs came</v>
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>

1646
01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:34.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was powdered wigs that old dudes used</v>

1647
01:13:34.361 --> 01:13:36.860
<v Speaker 2>to wear and the people in court used to</v>
<v Speaker 2>wear.</v>

1648
01:13:36.940 --> 01:13:37.630
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1649

<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

1652
01:13:46.031 --> 01:13:48.760
<v Speaker 2>Workers are white people that wish they</v>
<v Speaker 2>were blocked.</v>

1653
01:13:48.850 --> 01:13:50.200
<v Speaker 2>It's a totally different thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1654
01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:51.253
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1754
01:18:01.791 --> 01:18:03.890
<v Speaker 2>movie that it would been affleck.</v>

1756
01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:11.580
<v Speaker 2>That's why they lost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got a thought.</v>

1757
01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:15.920
<v Speaker 2>Like Jamie's got a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They lost me with those ballads that</v>

1758
01:18:15.921 --> 01:18:19.460
<v Speaker 2>they were doing for those love movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I needed that shit though.</v>

1759
01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:20.450
<v Speaker 2>Did you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Nimo Bro.</v>

1761
01:18:21.860 --> 01:18:24.830
<v Speaker 2>I was fucking swimming around and tears</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit when I was a kid.</v>

1762
01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:32.480
<v Speaker 2>It's hard for me to keep my emotions</v>
<v Speaker 2>away from the front of my thoughts and</v>

1763
01:18:32.481 --> 01:18:34.100
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

1764
01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:36.980
<v Speaker 2>What do you think that's about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you had to guess</v>

1765
01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:41.060
<v Speaker 2>when I was growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have a lot of emotions.</v>

1766
01:18:41.930 --> 01:18:43.660
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you're in touch with your emotions.</v>

1767
01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:45.620
<v Speaker 2>They just come pouring out at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they do,</v>

1768
01:18:45.621 --> 01:18:46.820
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1769
01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:47.900
<v Speaker 2>and it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1770
01:18:47.901 --> 01:18:50.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of grateful for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm grateful to have a.</v>

1771
01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:51.980
<v Speaker 2>Some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1772
01:18:51.981 --> 01:18:53.300
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me it's,</v>

1773
01:18:53.990 --> 01:18:55.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably a lot of people like that</v>

1774
01:18:55.521 --> 01:18:57.190
<v Speaker 2>are just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

1775
01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:59.420
<v Speaker 2>I never knew how I felt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was always like,</v>

1776
01:18:59.421 --> 01:19:00.590
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on?</v>

1777
01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:03.650
<v Speaker 2>I would ask my friends who I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who am I?</v>

1778
01:19:03.710 --> 01:19:04.820
<v Speaker 2>Who are you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1779
01:19:04.910 --> 01:19:06.380
<v Speaker 2>I would ask them and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1780
01:19:06.381 --> 01:19:09.350
<v Speaker 2>some of my friends were dumb and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't fucking say anything so I just</v>

1781
01:19:09.351 --> 01:19:10.790
<v Speaker 2>still be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1782
01:19:10.970 --> 01:19:13.850
<v Speaker 2>and I think as I get a little bit older</v>
<v Speaker 2>than I start to get in touch with them</v>

1783
01:19:13.851 --> 01:19:14.960
<v Speaker 2>more and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh man.</v>

1784
01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:19.190
<v Speaker 2>Feelings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much of a big growth push was it for</v>

1785
01:19:19.191 --> 01:19:23.870
<v Speaker 2>you to get California?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being around all those different kinds</v>

1786
01:19:23.871 --> 01:19:25.610
<v Speaker 2>of people and be around the comedy</v>
<v Speaker 2>store.</v>

1787
01:19:25.611 --> 01:19:29.330
<v Speaker 2>And I think intimidating is the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing for me.</v>

1788
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:31.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to bother people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1789
01:19:31.280 --> 01:19:36.280
<v Speaker 2>sometimes it still is like I'll talk to</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys that I admire or look up to as</v>

1790
01:19:36.321 --> 01:19:40.910
<v Speaker 2>comedians and sometimes I feel um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel in,</v>

1791
01:19:41.030 --> 01:19:43.250
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I feel inferior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just,</v>

1792
01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:47.630
<v Speaker 2>for some reason I always feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1793
01:19:47.720 --> 01:19:50.060
<v Speaker 2>I don't want people to think that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to take anything from them.</v>

1794
01:19:50.630 --> 01:19:53.750
<v Speaker 2>I know what you mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it makes me feel like I feel like</v>

1795
01:19:53.751 --> 01:19:56.540
<v Speaker 2>that to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I'm afraid to ask sometimes or</v>

1796
01:19:56.541 --> 01:19:59.600
<v Speaker 2>to talk or even to engage because I just</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that people are gonna think that</v>

1797
01:19:59.601 --> 01:20:03.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm not trying to be genuine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1798
01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:05.870
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if I don't know how I feel and how</v>

1799
01:20:05.871 --> 01:20:07.980
<v Speaker 2>genuine I am sometimes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or if I questioned that,</v>

1800
01:20:07.980 --> 01:20:11.400
<v Speaker 1>if I question myself all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then that makes it even double scary to</v>

1801
01:20:11.401 --> 01:20:13.740
<v Speaker 1>try and like create friendships and</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1802
01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:15.960
<v Speaker 1>I feel you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know exactly what you're saying,</v>

1803
01:20:16.650 --> 01:20:19.680
<v Speaker 1>but it's getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's been a lot of support,</v>

1804
01:20:19.681 --> 01:20:21.630
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys like you get into hanging out with</v>

1805
01:20:21.631 --> 01:20:23.370
<v Speaker 1>some of the other guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1806
01:20:23.371 --> 01:20:25.530
<v Speaker 1>and just realize that we're all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same.</v>

1807
01:20:25.650 --> 01:20:28.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just takes a while to realize that I</v>

1808
01:20:28.291 --> 01:20:29.550
<v Speaker 1>remember the same feeling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a,</v>

1809
01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:34.880
<v Speaker 1>especially in the nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>know when my career could have gone any.</v>

1810
01:20:35.070 --> 01:20:37.530
<v Speaker 1>Either way it could have crashed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>burned.</v>

1811
01:20:37.531 --> 01:20:41.040
<v Speaker 1>Just as easy as it could have survived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't necessarily have to keep</v>

1812
01:20:41.041 --> 01:20:43.140
<v Speaker 1>going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now all those,</v>

1813
01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:46.560
<v Speaker 1>those days when you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you run into people that were</v>

1814
01:20:46.561 --> 01:20:49.080
<v Speaker 1>successful at see them and I just feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>

1815
01:20:49.081 --> 01:20:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to say hi to him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Felt odd.</v>

1816
01:20:51.870 --> 01:20:55.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met Dave Chappelle when he was like,</v>

1817
01:20:56.400 --> 01:21:00.810
<v Speaker 1>I think he was 18 and I was 21 or 22 or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1818
01:21:00.811 --> 01:21:02.430
<v Speaker 1>How old Dave now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>40 six.</v>

1819
01:21:04.670 --> 01:21:08.190
<v Speaker 1>I think he's four years younger than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So whatever that was.</v>

1820
01:21:08.250 --> 01:21:10.440
<v Speaker 1>So maybe he was 18.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was 44.</v>

1821
01:21:10.650 --> 01:21:12.030
<v Speaker 1>40th four.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So older than that.</v>

1822
01:21:12.150 --> 01:21:17.150
<v Speaker 1>So he must've been 18 and I must've been</v>
<v Speaker 1>24.</v>

1823
01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.100
<v Speaker 1>So when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I met him,</v>

1824
01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:23.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were both just starting out,</v>

1825
01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:28.530
<v Speaker 1>we were both kids but he got way more</v>
<v Speaker 1>famous than me quick and I was more</v>

1826
01:21:28.531 --> 01:21:32.790
<v Speaker 1>famous for doing other shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was famous for fear factor and</v>

1827
01:21:32.791 --> 01:21:35.310
<v Speaker 1>for being on a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a sitcom,</v>

1828
01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:38.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't famous for being myself and so</v>

1829
01:21:38.011 --> 01:21:40.230
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like weird around him too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But he was always friendly.</v>

1830
01:21:40.350 --> 01:21:41.041
<v Speaker 1>They'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1831
01:21:41.041 --> 01:21:43.230
<v Speaker 1>I guess I guess he actually likes me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1832
01:21:43.260 --> 01:21:46.650
<v Speaker 1>But there's that weird thing where you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes a while to be comfortable</v>

1833
01:21:46.651 --> 01:21:50.520
<v Speaker 1>enough in your own skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well now I see people like whoever it</v>

1834
01:21:50.521 --> 01:21:52.500
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a ran into pat and Oswald last</v>

1835
01:21:52.501 --> 01:21:53.410
<v Speaker 1>night gave him a big hug.</v>

1836
01:21:53.410 --> 01:21:54.390
<v Speaker 1>Like what's up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing?</v>

1837
01:21:54.570 --> 01:21:56.220
<v Speaker 1>I didn't feel weird around him at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1838
01:21:56.260 --> 01:21:59.550
<v Speaker 1>I don't feel reared around other famous</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedians anymore,</v>

1839
01:21:59.670 --> 01:22:04.670
<v Speaker 1>but I certainly did you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you always question your legitimacy</v>

1840
01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:09.810
<v Speaker 1>question whether or not you should be</v>
<v Speaker 1>there know question whether you're good</v>

1841
01:22:09.811 --> 01:22:13.590
<v Speaker 1>enough or whether they like you or maybe</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't like your kind of comedy or</v>

1842
01:22:13.591 --> 01:22:15.300
<v Speaker 1>maybe they don't like what you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>or.</v>

1843
01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:17.520
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1844
01:22:17.521 --> 01:22:17.971
<v Speaker 1>There's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1845
01:22:17.971 --> 01:22:20.310
<v Speaker 1>There's so many questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so much in.</v>

1846
01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:21.541
<v Speaker 1>For me anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1847
01:22:21.541 --> 01:22:23.910
<v Speaker 1>there was some of just been so much in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1848
01:22:23.911 --> 01:22:25.950
<v Speaker 1>a feeling of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1849
01:22:25.951 --> 01:22:30.180
<v Speaker 1>just growing up feelings of self worth</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues and then it meant all that kind</v>

1850
01:22:30.181 --> 01:22:32.520
<v Speaker 1>of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think it does get better.</v>

1851
01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:35.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is sometimes when it gets</v>

1852
01:22:35.401 --> 01:22:36.450
<v Speaker 1>better,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get less funny.</v>

1853
01:22:37.140 --> 01:22:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it gets better.</v>

1854
01:22:38.581 --> 01:22:40.410
<v Speaker 1>You get comfortable when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable,</v>

1855
01:22:40.411 --> 01:22:45.150
<v Speaker 1>you stop working hard because a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes you work hard is that</v>

1856
01:22:45.151 --> 01:22:46.170
<v Speaker 1>insecurity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1857
01:22:46.180 --> 01:22:48.930
<v Speaker 1>that fucking thing that made you need</v>
<v Speaker 1>all that attention when you were younger</v>

1858
01:22:48.931 --> 01:22:50.790
<v Speaker 1>in the first place because you weren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting it growing up.</v>

1859
01:22:51.210 --> 01:22:52.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1860
01:22:52.321 --> 01:22:56.520
<v Speaker 1>I never met any comedian that's worth a</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit that had an awesome life growing up</v>

1861
01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:01.140
<v Speaker 1>all of our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're fucked up.</v>

1862
01:23:02.010 --> 01:23:05.590
<v Speaker 1>We're fucked up or weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You went through some crazy shit for</v>

1863
01:23:05.591 --> 01:23:06.730
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Walter.</v>

1864
01:23:07.060 --> 01:23:10.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy laying in such a Dutch,</v>

1865
01:23:10.001 --> 01:23:11.200
<v Speaker 1>that Walter Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

1866
01:23:11.201 --> 01:23:12.280
<v Speaker 1>I ducked him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1867
01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:13.840
<v Speaker 1>nothing happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was,</v>

1868
01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:16.660
<v Speaker 1>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a small moment because it was a</v>

1869
01:23:16.661 --> 01:23:18.010
<v Speaker 1>big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could have been a big moment,</v>

1870
01:23:18.011 --> 01:23:19.480
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just a day,</v>

1871
01:23:19.481 --> 01:23:20.350
<v Speaker 1>but I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

1872
01:23:20.351 --> 01:23:23.650
<v Speaker 1>this guy actually wanted to fuck me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I thought he was just a cool old</v>

1873
01:23:23.651 --> 01:23:27.850
<v Speaker 1>dude that liked hanging around with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>younger kids and being friendly to him</v>

1874
01:23:27.940 --> 01:23:30.910
<v Speaker 1>because he was a nice guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He tells them he was in the Korean War.</v>

1875
01:23:31.150 --> 01:23:36.150
<v Speaker 1>Tell us some shit about the war and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think it's a good question.</v>

1876
01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:37.720
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did.</v>

1877
01:23:37.721 --> 01:23:42.721
<v Speaker 1>Tell me about a guy who on the base who</v>
<v Speaker 1>backed up into a propeller guy fucked up</v>

1878
01:23:43.721 --> 01:23:46.690
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a propeller for airplane.</v>

1879
01:23:46.691 --> 01:23:50.260
<v Speaker 1>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what gets got decapitated.</v>

1880
01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:53.810
<v Speaker 1>Oh</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

1881
01:23:55.180 --> 01:23:57.910
<v Speaker 1>I fucked up fucking smoothie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

1882
01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:01.180
<v Speaker 1>I read about that recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read about that recently.</v>

1883
01:24:01.181 --> 01:24:03.730
<v Speaker 1>Somebody did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of my biggest fears is</v>

1884
01:24:03.731 --> 01:24:07.270
<v Speaker 1>walking into something that's spinning</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know it woo helicopters,</v>

1885
01:24:07.271 --> 01:24:09.310
<v Speaker 1>men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a dark way to go.</v>

1886
01:24:09.430 --> 01:24:10.090
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that,</v>

1887
01:24:10.090 --> 01:24:11.410
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that inferiority stuff,</v>

01:24:11.411 --> 01:24:12.430
<v Speaker 1>it's uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's A.</v>

1889
01:24:12.700 --> 01:24:13.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then Hollywood.</v>

1890
01:24:13.730 --> 01:24:15.430
<v Speaker 1>It's an intimidating place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1891
01:24:15.710 --> 01:24:17.740
<v Speaker 1>and it's tough to trust your voice and</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially,</v>

1892
01:24:18.070 --> 01:24:19.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come out here from the south,</v>

1893
01:24:19.221 --> 01:24:21.760
<v Speaker 1>then you get here and you realize like</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not even anybody with a southern</v>

1894
01:24:21.761 --> 01:24:24.280
<v Speaker 1>accent on fucking network television</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

1895
01:24:24.430 --> 01:24:26.770
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After Brett Butler said,</v>

1896
01:24:26.771 --> 01:24:28.240
<v Speaker 1>fuck this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she was great.</v>

1897
01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:31.750

<v Speaker 1>She reminded me of my mom.</v>

1898
01:24:31.751 --> 01:24:33.040
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>

<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

1909
01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:07.420
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood is definitely it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's intimidating too because not for us</v>

1910
01:25:07.421 --> 01:25:10.420
<v Speaker 1>anymore as much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

1911
01:25:10.421 --> 01:25:11.680
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you first start now,</v>

1912
01:25:11.710 --> 01:25:16.710
<v Speaker 1>if you do in any kind of auditioning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you realize why people are so crazy and</v>

1913
01:25:17.201 --> 01:25:22.201
<v Speaker 1>insecure and insincere out here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Brian Kaplan has a TV show now and</v>

1914
01:25:23.441 --> 01:25:24.550
<v Speaker 1>a schooled,</v>

01:25:24.550 --> 01:25:26.010
<v Speaker 1>Is that what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is always called.</v>

1916
01:25:26.740 --> 01:25:29.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the coach for the goldbergs now</v>

1917
01:25:29.501 --> 01:25:31.330
<v Speaker 1>he's got to spin off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's super happy.</v>

1918
01:25:31.630 --> 01:25:34.600
<v Speaker 1>But he had to do this thing recently</v>
<v Speaker 1>where he was,</v>

1919
01:25:34.601 --> 01:25:38.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm around all these actors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one of those upfronts thing and</v>

1920
01:25:38.771 --> 01:25:39.461
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

1921
01:25:39.461 --> 01:25:41.620
<v Speaker 1>they're so exhausting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not real.</v>

1922
01:25:41.770 --> 01:25:43.240
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not really talking to you.</v>

1923
01:25:43.241 --> 01:25:45.910
<v Speaker 1>Like they're like pretending that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're talking to you.</v>

1924
01:25:46.300 --> 01:25:47.021
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1925
01:25:47.021 --> 01:25:48.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta.</v>

1926
01:25:48.190 --> 01:25:52.210
<v Speaker 1>Think of what they do and</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about what you do.</v>

1927
01:25:52.211 --> 01:25:53.890
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go up there,</v>

1928
01:25:53.891 --> 01:25:55.090
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Theo Vaughn,</v>

1929
01:25:55.270 --> 01:25:57.310
<v Speaker 1>you go on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody clap and you do whatever the</v>

1930
01:25:57.311 --> 01:25:58.420
<v Speaker 1>fuck you want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1931
01:25:58.540 --> 01:25:59.980
<v Speaker 1>There's no one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no director does.</v>

1932
01:25:59.981 --> 01:26:03.920
<v Speaker 1>No writer was telling you what to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with actors.</v>

1933
01:26:03.950 --> 01:26:07.880
<v Speaker 1>It's all about getting that person in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the room,</v>

1934
01:26:07.970 --> 01:26:09.040
<v Speaker 1>who's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1935
01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:12.020
<v Speaker 1>the casting agent or the producer to</v>
<v Speaker 1>like them.</v>

1936
01:26:12.410 --> 01:26:15.710
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you have to be super left wing,</v>

1937
01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:18.650
<v Speaker 1>super liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to talk like they talk,</v>

1938
01:26:18.770 --> 01:26:21.260
<v Speaker 1>you have to say things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's getting gray sheet you with them.</v>

1939
01:26:21.450 --> 01:26:23.360
<v Speaker 1>You've got to fit in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta fit it.</v>

1940
01:26:23.361 --> 01:26:28.340
<v Speaker 1>So everybody's scared to do anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not inside the political norm.</v>

1941
01:26:28.550 --> 01:26:31.070
<v Speaker 1>The sociological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1942
01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:35.180
<v Speaker 1>the boundaries that have been set up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to stay inside those boundaries.</v>

1943
01:26:35.450 --> 01:26:40.040
<v Speaker 1>And so everybody's doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like everybody can't be left wing out</v>

1944
01:26:40.041 --> 01:26:41.990
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't be everybody's really left wing.</v>

1945
01:26:42.250 --> 01:26:45.650
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be some variation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there is an all of society but not</v>

1946
01:26:45.651 --> 01:26:46.520
<v Speaker 1>out here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

1947
01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:51.200
<v Speaker 1>Everybody is trying to conform to what</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think everybody wants them to be</v>

1948
01:26:51.201 --> 01:26:52.250
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1949
01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:55.190
<v Speaker 1>And so you're always scared and then you</v>
<v Speaker 1>always have to get picked.</v>

1950
01:26:55.540 --> 01:26:58.640
<v Speaker 1>You have to get picked for things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're always worried to people like</v>

1951
01:26:58.641 --> 01:26:59.030
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

1952
01:26:59.030 --> 01:27:01.430
<v Speaker 1>You always get.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why when people make it like a</v>

1953
01:27:01.431 --> 01:27:04.070
<v Speaker 1>really make it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they become fucking nightmares because</v>

1954
01:27:04.071 --> 01:27:07.820
<v Speaker 1>they want to punish people for all those</v>
<v Speaker 1>years they were insecure for all those</v>

1955
01:27:07.821 --> 01:27:10.280
<v Speaker 1>years where they weren't getting picked</v>
<v Speaker 1>for all those years.</v>

1956
01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:14.240
<v Speaker 1>You've been a piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't recognize they get in there and</v>

1957
01:27:14.241 --> 01:27:16.490
<v Speaker 1>then they want to be angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're afraid to let go of that.</v>

1958
01:27:16.700 --> 01:27:18.800
<v Speaker 1>They're afraid to not suck off the tit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1959
01:27:18.830 --> 01:27:22.070
<v Speaker 1>you can't piss off the tit or you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>got no milk.</v>

1960
01:27:22.130 --> 01:27:22.963
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get.</v>

1961
01:27:23.910 --> 01:27:26.120
<v Speaker 1>But it's the worst combination ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1962
01:27:26.210 --> 01:27:27.043
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

1963
01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:30.650
<v Speaker 1>you think it's going to be sustainable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't think I'll be connecting</v>

1964
01:27:30.651 --> 01:27:32.510
<v Speaker 1>with people as much as it used to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

1966
01:27:34.341 --> 01:27:35.810
<v Speaker 1>able to create stuff and do things.</v>

1967
01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:37.190
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you like to act?</v>

1968
01:27:37.490 --> 01:27:38.340
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

1969
01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:40.910
<v Speaker 1>I would like to create some shows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to create a show based on a</v>

1970
01:27:40.911 --> 01:27:41.571
<v Speaker 1>childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1971
01:27:41.571 --> 01:27:45.830
<v Speaker 1>my neighborhood I grew up in and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't mind doing some acting,</v>

1972
01:27:46.070 --> 01:27:47.330
<v Speaker 1>but maybe like in that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1973
01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:49.610
<v Speaker 1>Danny Mcbride type of Vibe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1974
01:27:49.990 --> 01:27:53.250
<v Speaker 1>you to showing your Dick verbal at</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody you know,</v>

1975
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:56.450
<v Speaker 1>and you're just fucking eating orphans</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the back of your brain the whole day.</v>

1976
01:27:56.451 --> 01:27:59.510
<v Speaker 1>Bron smoking fucking cigarettes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>blowing winds and fun.</v>

1977
01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:02.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having fun and with the director,</v>

1978
01:28:02.361 --> 01:28:03.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you trust and you could do that</v>

1979
01:28:03.711 --> 01:28:06.620
<v Speaker 1>kind of stuff and it gets you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're standing up is so good</v>

1980
01:28:06.621 --> 01:28:09.800
<v Speaker 1>that you could do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it just going to take awhile for</v>

1981
01:28:09.801 --> 01:28:12.080
<v Speaker 1>people to recognize it and then you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to do that.</v>

1982
01:28:12.890 --> 01:28:14.420
<v Speaker 1>But I think your standup is so good.</v>

1983
01:28:14.870 --> 01:28:17.480
<v Speaker 1>All that shit is not going to be as fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think,</v>

1984
01:28:17.510 --> 01:28:18.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1985
01:28:19.010 --> 01:28:20.510
<v Speaker 1>thanks man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

1986
01:28:20.550 --> 01:28:21.950
<v Speaker 1>you one of the funniest guys in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

1987
01:28:22.130 --> 01:28:23.480
<v Speaker 1>I really think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks man.</v>

1988
01:28:23.860 --> 01:28:26.400
<v Speaker 1>I appreciate that means a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1989
01:28:26.670 --> 01:28:27.620
<v Speaker 1>and I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1990
01:28:27.710 --> 01:28:30.580
<v Speaker 1>that talent that you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a,</v>

1991
01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:33.500
<v Speaker 1>that's the funniest shit you're ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to see is like someone killing.</v>

1992
01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:35.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By far.</v>

1993
01:28:35.630 --> 01:28:39.380
<v Speaker 1>Like Joey Diaz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always say there's no way I can laugh</v>

1994
01:28:39.381 --> 01:28:42.680
<v Speaker 1>harder than when Joey Diaz is killing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't exist.</v>

1995
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:45.980
<v Speaker 1>I've seen everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen almost every funny movie that</v>

1996
01:28:45.981 --> 01:28:47.210
<v Speaker 1>everybody tells me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to see.</v>

1997
01:28:47.600 --> 01:28:50.600
<v Speaker 1>A lot of them were amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing movies and I know it's a</v>

1998
01:28:50.601 --> 01:28:54.470
<v Speaker 1>different thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in terms of like the overall impact</v>

1999
01:28:54.471 --> 01:28:58.370
<v Speaker 1>that something has when a standup comic</v>
<v Speaker 1>is fucking murdering,</v>

2000
01:28:58.520 --> 01:28:59.770
<v Speaker 1>just murdering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2001
01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:00.890
<v Speaker 1>That's the funniest shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

2002
01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:02.790
<v Speaker 1>And that's what you do already.</v>

2003
01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:05.250
<v Speaker 1>You already do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think it's,</v>

2004
01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:10.080
<v Speaker 1>it's a good thing to have variety in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your life and I think you're a talented</v>

2005
01:29:10.081 --> 01:29:11.250
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could probably do a lot of different</v>

2006
01:29:11.251 --> 01:29:12.800
<v Speaker 1>things if you want it to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2007
01:29:12.870 --> 01:29:15.630
<v Speaker 1>But don't ever do anything that's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get in the way that stand up,</v>

2008
01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:17.670
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just don't because it's too hard to get</v>

2009
01:29:17.671 --> 01:29:19.440
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how long you been doing standup for</v>

2010
01:29:19.441 --> 01:29:21.720
<v Speaker 1>15 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about it.</v>

2011
01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:25.590
<v Speaker 1>You will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you weren't as good as you are now four</v>

2012
01:29:25.591 --> 01:29:27.090
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2013
01:29:27.091 --> 01:29:28.950
<v Speaker 1>So 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>11 years in,</v>

2014
01:29:29.250 --> 01:29:31.410
<v Speaker 1>you're still swinging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to connect,</v>

2015
01:29:31.411 --> 01:29:33.090
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes it doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2016
01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:34.860
<v Speaker 1>eight years in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not that good,</v>

2017
01:29:34.900 --> 01:29:38.640
<v Speaker 1>no bad nights off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling weird,</v>

2018
01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:42.060
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't feel good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then all sudden 15 years in you're on</v>

2019
01:29:42.061 --> 01:29:45.630
<v Speaker 1>fire right now you're cooking with gas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're smooth and you're going to get</v>

2020
01:29:45.631 --> 01:29:46.350
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

2021
01:29:46.350 --> 01:29:48.660
<v Speaker 1>You're going to keep getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way around it.</v>

2022
01:29:48.661 --> 01:29:52.890
<v Speaker 1>If you keep improving and keep working</v>
<v Speaker 1>at it and keep analyzing your material</v>

2023
01:29:52.891 --> 01:29:56.550
<v Speaker 1>and writing a lot and taking chances on</v>
<v Speaker 1>stage and thinking about what you did</v>

2024
01:29:56.551 --> 01:29:59.790
<v Speaker 1>and listening to your sets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get better and you're</v>

2025
01:29:59.791 --> 01:30:03.990
<v Speaker 1>already doing something that is so</v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to get really good at.</v>

2026
01:30:04.030 --> 01:30:07.710
<v Speaker 1>It's so difficult to get really good at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Standup takes so long.</v>

2027
01:30:08.040 --> 01:30:10.230
<v Speaker 1>Take so much thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2028
01:30:10.350 --> 01:30:11.340
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're always,</v>

2029
01:30:12.370 --> 01:30:15.360
<v Speaker 1>you're always subject to fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like right now I'm writing a whole new</v>

2030
01:30:15.361 --> 01:30:17.220
<v Speaker 1>hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got six minutes,</v>

2031
01:30:17.221 --> 01:30:21.780

<v Speaker 1>Six new minutes and I've been opening</v>

2032
01:30:21.781 --> 01:30:24.600
<v Speaker 1>with that six minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know exactly how long it lasts.</v>

2033
01:30:24.630 --> 01:30:28.480
<v Speaker 1>It lasts six minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got to have 10 times that before I can</v>

2034
01:30:28.481 --> 01:30:31.080
<v Speaker 1>go on the road and it's going to take</v>
<v Speaker 1>months,</v>

2035
01:30:31.080 --> 01:30:32.370
<v Speaker 1>months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>months of thinking,</v>

2036
01:30:32.371 --> 01:30:35.940
<v Speaker 1>and I'm going to do mushrooms and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get in the isolation tank and</v>

2037
01:30:35.941 --> 01:30:39.450
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go on hikes with notebook</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's no way around it.</v>

2038
01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:43.650
<v Speaker 1>You've got to do that work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm already at a place where I've</v>

2039
01:30:43.651 --> 01:30:46.740
<v Speaker 1>done this so many times and I've done</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven specials.</v>

2040
01:30:46.741 --> 01:30:47.830
<v Speaker 1>I know how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

2041
01:30:47.910 --> 01:30:50.280
<v Speaker 1>I know it can be done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just gotTa do the work.</v>

2042
01:30:50.730 --> 01:30:52.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you had to start from scratch</v>

2043
01:30:52.981 --> 01:30:55.260
<v Speaker 1>where you never did it before and get to</v>
<v Speaker 1>this point again,</v>

2044
01:30:55.261 --> 01:30:58.320
<v Speaker 1>it would be exhausting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would take decades and you're there</v>

2045

01:31:28.771 --> 01:31:31.440
<v Speaker 1>But it's like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you seem to at least be able to sustain</v>

2062
01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:35.310
<v Speaker 1>and have your way of life without having</v>
<v Speaker 1>to conform,</v>

2063
01:31:35.470 --> 01:31:37.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it does take a lot of conformity</v>

2064
01:31:37.051 --> 01:31:38.520
<v Speaker 1>within Hollywood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like,</v>

2065
01:31:38.521 --> 01:31:39.354
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2066
01:31:39.990 --> 01:31:41.550
<v Speaker 1>and I think that that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's admirable.</v>

2067
01:31:41.551 --> 01:31:42.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you inspire a lot of people,</v>

2068
01:31:42.871 --> 01:31:44.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a lot of strange ways.</v>

2069
01:31:44.941 --> 01:31:46.970
<v Speaker 1>I think that he probably don't even</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize strange with.</v>

2070
01:31:47.010 --> 01:31:48.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think to some people you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2071
01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:49.290
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2072
01:31:49.370 --> 01:31:50.850
<v Speaker 1>like a brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>older brother,</v>

2073
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:52.350
<v Speaker 1>a younger brother figure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>who knows,</v>

2075
01:31:53.731 --> 01:31:56.010
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you always stay excited about life.</v>

2076
01:31:56.011 --> 01:31:58.110
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how the fuck is this dude?</v>

2077
01:31:58.110 --> 01:32:01.520
<v Speaker 1>So excited about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's great though.</v>

2078
01:32:01.521 --> 01:32:03.640
<v Speaker 1>I know and that's what's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what's amazing.</v>

2079
01:32:03.641 --> 01:32:05.160
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2080
01:32:05.161 --> 01:32:06.250
<v Speaker 1>there's terms now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>

2081
01:32:06.260 --> 01:32:10.660
<v Speaker 1>I was listening to one year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of your podcasts and I was and you</v>

2082
01:32:10.661 --> 01:32:12.790
<v Speaker 1>were just talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2083
01:32:12.791 --> 01:32:14.740
<v Speaker 1>when you don't want to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just go do it.</v>

2084
01:32:14.970 --> 01:32:17.130
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what I think now sometimes</v>

2085
01:32:17.180 --> 01:32:19.510
<v Speaker 1>what I don't want to go jog or I don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to go to yoga or don't want to,</v>

2086
01:32:19.690 --> 01:32:20.860
<v Speaker 1>it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just go do it.</v>

2087
01:32:20.980 --> 01:32:23.350
<v Speaker 1>You'll feel better at the end and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2088
01:32:23.380 --> 01:32:24.430
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's little things.</v>

2089
01:32:24.431 --> 01:32:27.520
<v Speaker 1>It gets stuck in your head man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But appreciate the nice words Bro.</v>

2090
01:32:28.120 --> 01:32:28.953
<v Speaker 1>My pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2091
01:32:29.340 --> 01:32:31.600
<v Speaker 1>it's about motion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to stay in motion,</v>

2092
01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:33.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you just stay stagnant and sit down.</v>

2093
01:32:34.270 --> 01:32:36.550
<v Speaker 1>It's not good to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to run today.</v>

2094
01:32:36.640 --> 01:32:37.330
<v Speaker 1>I did it though.</v>

2095
01:32:37.330 --> 01:32:37.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me too.</v>

2096
01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:40.600
<v Speaker 1>I just went out and did it like fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was over.</v>

2097
01:32:41.140 --> 01:32:43.720
<v Speaker 1>But it was when you don't want to do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you force yourself to do it,</v>

2098
01:32:43.721 --> 01:32:45.040
<v Speaker 1>the feeling you get at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2099
01:32:45.130 --> 01:32:47.100
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so good because I didn't,</v>

2100
01:32:47.110 --> 01:32:50.350
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like I will take time off if I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't feel well.</v>

2101
01:32:50.410 --> 01:32:51.221
<v Speaker 1>Like if I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2102
01:32:51.221 --> 01:32:54.220
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm coming down with something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I won't work out stupid,</v>

2103
01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:59.550
<v Speaker 1>but that wasn't what was going on today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today I was just feeling lazy and just</v>

2104
01:33:00.071 --> 01:33:00.970
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For whatever reason,</v>

2105
01:33:00.971 --> 01:33:02.470
<v Speaker 1>I've been traveling a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2106
01:33:02.471 --> 01:33:05.470
<v Speaker 1>I just don't have the get up and go</v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

2107
01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:07.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you could force yourself,</v>

2108
01:33:07.841 --> 01:33:09.370
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just force yourself.</v>

2109
01:33:09.390 --> 01:33:10.540
<v Speaker 1>Just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just the beginning part.</v>

2110
01:33:10.541 --> 01:33:13.360
<v Speaker 1>That's the hard part is that little hump</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you're in the water.</v>

2111
01:33:14.350 --> 01:33:16.330
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love what you said about Joey Diaz.</v>

2112
01:33:16.330 --> 01:33:18.070
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've found myself watching him the other</v>

2113
01:33:18.071 --> 01:33:21.970
<v Speaker 1>night and before I knew it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was out of my seat like this bro.</v>

2114
01:33:21.971 --> 01:33:23.860
<v Speaker 1>Fist bump it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was at the end of the room,</v>

2115
01:33:24.060 --> 01:33:25.320
<v Speaker 1>like it was the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking.</v>

2116
01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:29.410
<v Speaker 1>And I'd never done that before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd never done that in my life.</v>

2117
01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:31.930
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is going on?</v>

2118
01:33:31.931 --> 01:33:35.740
<v Speaker 1>Something's happening to me when I watch</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

2119
01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:37.270
<v Speaker 1>I think he's the best of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2120
01:33:37.271 --> 01:33:39.400
<v Speaker 1>I think it's A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

2121
01:33:39.700 --> 01:33:42.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it might be better joke writers,</v>

2122
01:33:44.080 --> 01:33:47.050
<v Speaker 1>people have more of a body of work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2123
01:33:47.220 --> 01:33:51.400
<v Speaker 1>I've seen everybody though in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like who makes me laugh the hardest for</v>

2124
01:33:51.401 --> 01:33:55.480
<v Speaker 1>me and it's all very subjective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Joey Diaz is the funniest guy</v>

2125
01:33:55.481 --> 01:33:57.130
<v Speaker 1>that's ever lived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2126
01:33:57.131 --> 01:33:58.630
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I,</v>

2127
01:33:58.631 --> 01:34:01.450
<v Speaker 1>I love him and I love bill burr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're both comedian.</v>

<v Speaker 1>he's 70 and he's still going strong.</v>

2232
01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:46.140

<v Speaker 1>called exosomes and exosomes are</v>

2260
01:39:50.161 --> 01:39:53.880
<v Speaker 1>apparently the part of stem cells that</v>
<v Speaker 1>regenerate tissue.</v>

2261
01:39:54.030 --> 01:39:56.850
<v Speaker 1>They're able to isolate those and put</v>
<v Speaker 1>those in injuries.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2369
01:44:43.431 --> 01:44:47.330
<v Speaker 1>You gotta listen to that whole thing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking remember it or write it down.</v>

2370
01:44:47.331 --> 01:44:50.180
<v Speaker 1>Write it down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the only time you could find</v>

2371
01:44:50.181 --> 01:44:52.880
<v Speaker 1>out what was playing in a fucking movies</v>
<v Speaker 1>or you get the newspaper,</v>

2372
01:44:53.310 --> 01:44:55.090
<v Speaker 1>go to the newspaper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find out that.</v>

2373
01:44:55.730 --> 01:44:57.860
<v Speaker 1>And you trusted it and then you went</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2374
01:44:58.040 --> 01:44:59.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2375
01:44:59.091 --> 01:45:01.480
<v Speaker 1>You went there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did.</v>

2376
01:45:01.510 --> 01:45:03.740
<v Speaker 1>That was just a few years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's crazy.</v>

2377
01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:07.480
<v Speaker 1>That's unfathomable today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there was no more cell phones,</v>

2378
01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:10.790
<v Speaker 1>no more Internet on your phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was unfathomable when there's no</v>

2379
01:45:10.791 --> 01:45:13.040
<v Speaker 1>turning back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is going to happen with us.</v>

2380
01:45:13.130 --> 01:45:17.390
<v Speaker 1>That's also no turning back that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have now that we just were used to</v>

2381
01:45:17.391 --> 01:45:19.130
<v Speaker 1>not having it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's no big deal.</v>

2382
01:45:19.131 --> 01:45:21.860
<v Speaker 1>Like back in the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody thought about cell phones and the</v>

2383
01:45:21.861 --> 01:45:24.830
<v Speaker 1>Internet because they didn't have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't something they missed.</v>

2384
01:45:25.130 --> 01:45:26.630
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's come in.</v>

2385
01:45:27.980 --> 01:45:32.710
<v Speaker 1>I know what I think what some of it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's um,</v>

2386
01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:37.850
<v Speaker 1>just like complete transparency where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like through people's eyes you have</v>

2387
01:45:37.970 --> 01:45:40.400
<v Speaker 1>some sort of thing that can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know exactly,</v>

2388
01:45:40.401 --> 01:45:42.320
<v Speaker 1>like if they're being genuine or what</v>
<v Speaker 1>their thoughts are.</v>

2389
01:45:42.321 --> 01:45:43.400
<v Speaker 1>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think so,</v>

2390
01:45:43.460 --> 01:45:44.060
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2391
01:45:44.060 --> 01:45:46.940
<v Speaker 1>I think that's definitely coming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have the ability to read each</v>

2392
01:45:46.941 --> 01:45:50.930
<v Speaker 1>other's minds is coming for sure because</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need something to trump like people</v>

2393
01:45:50.931 --> 01:45:54.890
<v Speaker 1>who are just full of shit full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2394
01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:57.590
<v Speaker 1>And people who lie and people who don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want good,</v>

2395
01:45:57.680 --> 01:45:59.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where people are too greedy.</v>

2396
01:45:59.031 --> 01:46:00.980
<v Speaker 1>We just needed something to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something about that.</v>

2397
01:46:01.610 --> 01:46:02.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2398
01:46:02.870 --> 01:46:05.330
<v Speaker 1>I think there's gonna come a time where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could definitely read people's</v>

2399
01:46:05.331 --> 01:46:06.141
<v Speaker 1>minds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2400
01:46:06.141 --> 01:46:08.090
<v Speaker 1>they're already figured out a way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>implant memories.</v>

2401
01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:10.940
<v Speaker 1>Did you read that Shit about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've implanted memory.</v>

2402
01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:13.820
<v Speaker 1>They successfully implanted a memory in</v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

2403
01:46:14.030 --> 01:46:15.830
<v Speaker 1>What was the thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The implanted and then do you remember?</v>

2404
01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:20.130
<v Speaker 1>I think yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some animal just say figured out a way a</v>

2405
01:46:20.131 --> 01:46:21.920
<v Speaker 1>rat can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Successfully.</v>

2406
01:46:21.980 --> 01:46:26.690
<v Speaker 1>Implant a memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's going to come a point in time</v>

2407
01:46:26.780 --> 01:46:29.190
<v Speaker 1>where it's like someone said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like</v>

2408
01:46:31.480 --> 01:46:32.320
<v Speaker 1>a snail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2409
01:46:32.660 --> 01:46:33.990
<v Speaker 1>I'm not buying that.</v>

2410
01:46:36.580 --> 01:46:39.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to wait till the next year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2411
01:46:39.381 --> 01:46:43.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm super skeptical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scientist Transplant memories between</v>

2412
01:46:43.161 --> 01:46:47.900
<v Speaker 1>sea snails via injection experiment</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows some memories are encoded in</v>

2413
01:46:47.901 --> 01:46:50.010
<v Speaker 1>molecules that form part</v>

2414
01:46:50.010 --> 01:46:52.350
<v Speaker 2>of an organism's genetic machinery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Researchers say,</v>

2415
01:46:52.380 --> 01:46:54.480
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm too stupid to know whether or not</v>

2416
01:46:54.481 --> 01:46:55.860
<v Speaker 2>they're telling the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to believe them.</v>

2417
01:46:56.910 --> 01:46:58.530
<v Speaker 2>Don't believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does this in this is in the</v>

2418
01:46:58.531 --> 01:47:00.050
<v Speaker 2>Guardian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2419
01:47:00.180 --> 01:47:01.530
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2420
01:47:01.830 --> 01:47:04.260
<v Speaker 2>Well they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had that therapy now that emdr.</v>

2421
01:47:04.261 --> 01:47:05.640
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever done that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2422
01:47:05.730 --> 01:47:07.020
<v Speaker 2>What's that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where it's like they.</v>

2423
01:47:07.021 --> 01:47:09.270
<v Speaker 2>You hold on these panels and they like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's therapy.</v>

2424
01:47:09.300 --> 01:47:12.320
<v Speaker 2>It's therapy and it activates both sides</v>
<v Speaker 2>of your brain while you're like</v>

2425
01:47:12.330 --> 01:47:17.330
<v Speaker 2>remembering old things and then you like</v>
<v Speaker 2>replace those old fears are scary parts</v>

2426
01:47:17.851 --> 01:47:21.540
<v Speaker 2>of you with like new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like new parts,</v>

2427
01:47:21.541 --> 01:47:26.541
<v Speaker 2>like new ideas and new memories kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've gone to it a couple times,</v>

2428
01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:29.410
<v Speaker 2>probably about maybe 10 times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2429
01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:31.620
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go back into your thoughts and it's</v>

2430
01:47:31.650 --> 01:47:33.390
<v Speaker 2>while it's activating both sides of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain,</v>

2431
01:47:33.391 --> 01:47:36.330
<v Speaker 2>you can do stuff to your childhood that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you weren't able to do when you were a</v>

2432
01:47:36.331 --> 01:47:38.250
<v Speaker 2>kid because only one part of your brain</v>
<v Speaker 2>was developing.</v>

2433
01:47:38.610 --> 01:47:39.900
<v Speaker 2>That's what they say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

2434
01:47:40.020 --> 01:47:41.730
<v Speaker 2>What did you go back to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What'd you do it for?</v>

2435
01:47:42.210 --> 01:47:46.090
<v Speaker 2>How did it just for like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like maybe like for like probably a</v>

2436
01:47:46.110 --> 01:47:48.960
<v Speaker 2>father figure stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not having somebody to stand up for me</v>

2437
01:47:48.961 --> 01:47:50.580
<v Speaker 2>or feeling like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2438
01:47:50.581 --> 01:47:54.000
<v Speaker 2>certain times in my life where I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have support,</v>

2439
01:47:54.270 --> 01:47:55.470
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I felt like I was alone.</v>

2440
01:47:55.471 --> 01:47:58.920
<v Speaker 2>Like you go back and like you plug</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody in there with you that is</v>

2441
01:47:58.921 --> 01:48:01.890
<v Speaker 2>supportive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so while you're talking about it and</v>

2442
01:48:01.891 --> 01:48:03.570
<v Speaker 2>this thing's open up both sides of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>head,</v>

2443
01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:05.640
<v Speaker 2>it can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can help.</v>

2444
01:48:05.820 --> 01:48:09.300
<v Speaker 2>And what does it help with the going</v>
<v Speaker 2>back over that stuff from your</v>

2445
01:48:09.301 --> 01:48:10.810
<v Speaker 2>childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's good about doing that?</v>

2446
01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:13.320
<v Speaker 2>It replaces that memory with the new</v>
<v Speaker 2>memory.</v>

2447
01:48:13.530 --> 01:48:14.170
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2448
01:48:14.170 --> 01:48:16.020
<v Speaker 2>but isn't that memory even though it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>negative,</v>

2449
01:48:16.021 --> 01:48:20.310
<v Speaker 2>beneficial to you because you understand</v>
<v Speaker 2>why it was bad and then once someday</v>

2450
01:48:20.550 --> 01:48:23.580
<v Speaker 2>when you have kids you have learned from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mistakes too.</v>

2451
01:48:23.580 --> 01:48:27.030
<v Speaker 2>Good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you don't want to replace a bad</v>

2452
01:48:27.031 --> 01:48:31.150
<v Speaker 2>childhood with a good one in your brain</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he didn't have a good childhood.</v>

2453
01:48:31.170 --> 01:48:33.960
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's okay to have a bad childhood.</v>

2454
01:48:33.961 --> 01:48:35.180
<v Speaker 2>Like you've gone through that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2455
01:48:35.370 --> 01:48:38.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would think that for someone who's</v>

2456
01:48:38.430 --> 01:48:41.790
<v Speaker 2>dealing with something extremely</v>
<v Speaker 2>traumatic like childhood rape or</v>

2457
01:48:41.791 --> 01:48:44.280
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then maybe it makes sense.</v>

2458
01:48:44.340 --> 01:48:45.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Violence,</v>

2459
01:48:45.990 --> 01:48:48.360
<v Speaker 2>things along those lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something that's like haunts you all the</v>

2460
01:48:48.361 --> 01:48:51.420
<v Speaker 2>time that's messing with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>messing with your life today.</v>

2461
01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:54.690
<v Speaker 2>But like does your childhood messed with</v>
<v Speaker 2>your life today?</v>

2462
01:48:54.970 --> 01:48:55.920
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2463
01:48:56.400 --> 01:48:57.630
<v Speaker 2>So why fuck with it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2464
01:48:58.020 --> 01:48:58.890
<v Speaker 2>that's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2465
01:48:58.891 --> 01:49:00.060
<v Speaker 2>I never even thought about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess.</v>

2466
01:49:00.061 --> 01:49:01.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that stuff for people that's</v>

2467
01:49:01.650 --> 01:49:04.150
<v Speaker 2>extremely traumatic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but got through like a,</v>

2468
01:49:04.570 --> 01:49:05.550
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2469
01:49:05.640 --> 01:49:07.500
<v Speaker 2>a shot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an Arrow and fucking hit somebody on</v>

2470
01:49:07.501 --> 01:49:08.334
<v Speaker 2>accident or.</v>

2471
01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:09.181
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

2472
01:49:09.181 --> 01:49:10.590
<v Speaker 2>but if somebody did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

2473
01:49:11.340 --> 01:49:13.470
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I killed an animal with a knife or</v>

2474
01:49:13.471 --> 01:49:15.780
<v Speaker 2>something bad or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody killed my parents or something,</v>

2475
01:49:16.580 --> 01:49:18.500
<v Speaker 2>then you could go back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2476
01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:19.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2477
01:49:19.381 --> 01:49:21.300
<v Speaker 2>I think that's probably a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2478
01:49:21.870 --> 01:49:23.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess some of this stuff,</v>

2479
01:49:23.311 --> 01:49:26.550
<v Speaker 2>it's like some people it's debilitating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2480
01:49:26.551 --> 01:49:28.560
<v Speaker 2>their childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the trauma is so bad,</v>

2481
01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:32.490
<v Speaker 2>it haunts them and it keeps them from</v>
<v Speaker 2>improving and growing as a person.</v>

2482
01:49:32.550 --> 01:49:34.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like really horrible shit.</v>

2483
01:49:35.250 --> 01:49:37.230
<v Speaker 2>But for us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's fuel.</v>

2484
01:49:37.231 --> 01:49:41.490
<v Speaker 2>I think the goofiness of your and my</v>
<v Speaker 2>childhood and the bad,</v>

2485
01:49:41.670 --> 01:49:44.520
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of led you to become a</v>
<v Speaker 2>comedian really.</v>

2486
01:49:44.521 --> 01:49:47.990
<v Speaker 2>I really think that you do need the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean</v>

2487
01:49:48.130 --> 01:49:51.130
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about Joey Joey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he found his mother dead on the kitchen</v>

2488
01:49:51.131 --> 01:49:55.960
<v Speaker 1>floor when he was 13 years old on acid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jody has been through everything.</v>

2489
01:49:55.990 --> 01:49:59.070
<v Speaker 1>He's seen it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to think that there's</v>

2490
01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:01.450
<v Speaker 1>something to that that makes him so</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking funny,</v>

2491
01:50:01.940 --> 01:50:05.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you replaced all that childhood would</v>

2492
01:50:05.801 --> 01:50:08.560
<v Speaker 1>like the perfect loving parents that</v>
<v Speaker 1>were,</v>

2493
01:50:08.561 --> 01:50:11.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super engaged and there for them all the</v>

2494
01:50:11.321 --> 01:50:14.740
<v Speaker 1>time and very supportive and an amazing</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood with no violence,</v>

2495
01:50:14.741 --> 01:50:18.760
<v Speaker 1>no crime and all this diversity and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's super progressive.</v>

2496
01:50:19.150 --> 01:50:21.940
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to get a Joey Diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd be working at a cafeteria,</v>

2497
01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:25.210
<v Speaker 1>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or a library and he'd be one of the</v>

2498
01:50:25.211 --> 01:50:27.160
<v Speaker 1>hottest women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are probably two at the cafeteria,</v>

2499
01:50:27.990 --> 01:50:29.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something really special about him</v>

2500
01:50:29.811 --> 01:50:32.640
<v Speaker 1>and that's been a blessing to meeting</v>
<v Speaker 1>him is that like he'll call me salons</v>

2501
01:50:32.650 --> 01:50:33.760
<v Speaker 1>and just like check in on me.</v>

2502
01:50:33.760 --> 01:50:34.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does that all the time.</v>

2503
01:50:34.980 --> 01:50:36.790
<v Speaker 1>Calls me every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's so crazy.</v>

2504
01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:37.780
<v Speaker 1>It's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell you I love you.</v>

2505
01:50:38.650 --> 01:50:42.850
<v Speaker 1>I love you too man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like the first time he does it,</v>

2506
01:50:42.851 --> 01:50:44.770
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess me just like not trusting</v>

2507
01:50:44.771 --> 01:50:45.281
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2508
01:50:45.281 --> 01:50:48.580
<v Speaker 1>like my own internal thing sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then after like the 10th time you're</v>

2509
01:50:48.581 --> 01:50:49.420
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>damn man,</v>

2510
01:50:49.421 --> 01:50:50.620
<v Speaker 1>he's legit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2511
01:50:50.740 --> 01:50:52.580
<v Speaker 1>Like this guy really cares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty cool.</v>

2512
01:50:52.581 --> 01:50:54.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't text either thinks it's</v>

2513
01:50:54.461 --> 01:50:56.390
<v Speaker 1>impersonal and I think he's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2514
01:50:56.430 --> 01:50:58.210
<v Speaker 1>he likes to call you talk to him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The phone.</v>

2515
01:50:58.450 --> 01:50:59.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2516
01:50:59.790 --> 01:51:01.120
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what the future is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

2517
01:51:01.121 --> 01:51:03.670
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel sad if we get so far away from</v>

2518
01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:08.020
<v Speaker 1>each other that we don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember what it's like to have.</v>

2519
01:51:08.710 --> 01:51:11.110
<v Speaker 1>Like I feel like a smile is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in a museum one day,</v>

2520
01:51:11.111 --> 01:51:11.560
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2521
01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:14.020
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we'll still have smiles,</v>

2522
01:51:14.330 --> 01:51:18.400
<v Speaker 1>but we might get to a point where human</v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction is all done digitally.</v>

2523
01:51:18.820 --> 01:51:21.400
<v Speaker 1>That could happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think.</v>

2524
01:51:21.820 --> 01:51:24.010
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just going to get used to it.</v>

2525
01:51:24.070 --> 01:51:27.160
<v Speaker 1>Just like we're used to this life and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not living in caves anymore.</v>

2526
01:51:27.220 --> 01:51:28.790
<v Speaker 1>Those people that lived in caves like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2527
01:51:28.791 --> 01:51:30.450
<v Speaker 1>he's fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah man.</v>

2528
01:51:30.451 --> 01:51:32.590
<v Speaker 1>I never want to leave this as a way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

2529
01:51:32.920 --> 01:51:35.850
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking hideous for their cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Airplanes.</v>

2530
01:51:36.100 --> 01:51:39.250
<v Speaker 1>Like when you live in the cave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no going to the Bahamas.</v>

2531
01:51:39.700 --> 01:51:41.380
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to the Bahamas bitch.</v>

2532
01:51:41.500 --> 01:51:43.480
<v Speaker 1>You live in a cave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is where you live.</v>

2533
01:51:44.450 --> 01:51:47.350
<v Speaker 1>You can't go on vacation to Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fuck out of here,</v>

2534
01:51:47.351 --> 01:51:50.050
<v Speaker 1>there's no vacation and you live in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cave.</v>

2535
01:51:50.530 --> 01:51:53.890
<v Speaker 1>If you want to take your fucking family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to take your family through the</v>

2536
01:51:53.891 --> 01:51:55.870
<v Speaker 1>woods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get eaten by wolves.</v>

01:51:56.610 --> 01:51:59.130
<v Speaker 1>Aren't gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make it every pickney it didn't,</v>

2539
01:52:03.550 --> 01:52:07.030
<v Speaker 1>him blood all over each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think that as time goes on,</v>

2540

<v Speaker 1>like this is going to be the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to look back or someone is</v>

<v Speaker 1>us.</v>

2542
01:52:12.551 --> 01:52:16.390
<v Speaker 1>Now it's going to look back on us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like look at these dopes with</v>
