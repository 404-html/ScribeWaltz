<v Speaker 1>hockey.</v>

<v Speaker 1>hitting me in the ribs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

83
00:03:11.851 --> 00:03:11.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like them.</v>

84
00:03:11.951 --> 00:03:16.951

<v Speaker 1>I'll just iced the fool right there on </v>

85
00:03:16.951 --> 00:03:18.781
<v Speaker 1>the middle of the court.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it is weird that hockey is the only </v>

86
00:03:18.781 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 1>sport where you're allowed to beat </v>
<v Speaker 1>people up in the middle of the game.</v>

87
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Buddy Scott Parker,</v>

88
00:03:21.371 --> 00:03:23.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean he is the enforcer for the car as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

89
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.700
<v Speaker 1>He's retired now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean that was his job.</v>

90
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.720
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would tell me he was like mentally </v>

91
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.061
<v Speaker 1>have to prepare like him and I talk a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot about just the preparation of </v>

92
00:03:33.061 --> 00:03:34.600
<v Speaker 1>fighting and how he'd get game ready </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he knew he was fighting.</v>

93
00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:39.601
<v Speaker 1>Whoever was the other enforcers or he'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>be ready and it's cool like interacting </v>

94
00:03:39.601 --> 00:03:40.210
<v Speaker 1>with them in that sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

95
00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:41.590
<v Speaker 1>they like promote it like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

96
00:03:41.591 --> 00:03:43.750
<v Speaker 1>you're messing with my goalie or all </v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

97
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.330
<v Speaker 1>So they send up the enforce or like it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

98
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.580
<v Speaker 1>it's because it's Canadian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What a cool job.</v>

99
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:49.750
<v Speaker 1>It's a great job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

100
00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:53.110
<v Speaker 1>Like you're Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get Him in here.</v>

101
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.560
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's just funny that no other sport </v>

102
00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.350
<v Speaker 1>or any other sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you fight,</v>

103
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.770
<v Speaker 1>you're not just ejected from the game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're subject to penalties.</v>

104
00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.550
<v Speaker 1>You might get suspended in hockey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a normal thing.</v>

105
00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:07.690
<v Speaker 1>You mean if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

106
00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:12.750
<v Speaker 1>if versus you've played just hold off </v>
<v Speaker 1>and jump need someone's whole face off </v>

107
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:13.780
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of the game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be huge.</v>

108
00:04:13.781 --> 00:04:16.580
<v Speaker 1>And then they'd be in big trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's [inaudible] hockey?</v>

109
00:04:16.581 --> 00:04:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Like did not that stable because you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>on skates.</v>

110
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:24.330
<v Speaker 1>Like it takes a lot of fucking skate </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge to be able to brawl while </v>

111
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.260
<v Speaker 1>you're on skates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can barely fucking stand on skates.</v>

112
00:04:26.261 --> 00:04:27.190
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how to ice skate.</v>

113
00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.540
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm terrible at it.</v>

114
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.110
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

115
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:34.550
<v Speaker 1>I did it about two years ago and thought</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was cool to try to do the hockey stop </v>

116
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.640

<v Speaker 1>fucking eyes and that was,</v>

117
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:38.890
<v Speaker 1>that was the end of my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

118
00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:43.420
<v Speaker 1>my hockey dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm fighting him no idea.</v>

119
00:04:43.421 --> 00:04:46.030
<v Speaker 1>So I would imagine if you could teach a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dude like,</v>

120
00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.670
<v Speaker 1>dude who's like a figure skater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>teach them some,</v>

121
00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.790
<v Speaker 1>like real good kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could fuck somebody up,</v>

122
00:04:51.791 --> 00:04:53.200
<v Speaker 1>but you're not allowed to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

123
00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.470
<v Speaker 1>You can't just figure skate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll kick someone's fucking head off.</v>

124
00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.990
<v Speaker 1>Juggler die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

125
00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.140
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

126
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.660
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they can raise either knee</v>
<v Speaker 1>or anything.</v>

127
00:05:02.661 --> 00:05:04.630
<v Speaker 1>They can't bring any scuffs off your </v>
<v Speaker 1>feet down.</v>

128
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.780
<v Speaker 1>What about superman?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Punch wouldn't be effective.</v>

129
00:05:07.781 --> 00:05:11.220
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't even know that you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>throwing a kick came at him like full,</v>

130
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.720
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

131
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.790
<v Speaker 1>thor in the movie.</v>

132
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.260
<v Speaker 1>Troy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Excuse me.</v>

133
00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:20.270
<v Speaker 1>So like a trick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

134
00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:21.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

135
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have to be something.</v>

136
00:05:22.391 --> 00:05:24.010
<v Speaker 1>No one expected half deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

137
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.100
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just weird that they don't have </v>

138
00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.361
<v Speaker 1>that basketball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basketball becomes less and less </v>

139
00:05:30.361 --> 00:05:30.361
<v Speaker 1>popular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

140
00:05:30.361 --> 00:05:32.140
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they would have to bring it in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what did you know in hockey?</v>

141
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.410
<v Speaker 1>The enforcers can't wear a face mask.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kill it.</v>

142
00:05:35.411 --> 00:05:37.720
<v Speaker 1>They can only wear a helmet with no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With no guard.</v>

143
00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:39.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like a penalty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they do.</v>

144
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.640
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they can't take punishment.</v>

145
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:43.600
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

146
00:05:43.601 --> 00:05:48.601
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if one guy had it on and one guy </v>

147
00:05:48.601 --> 00:05:50.491
<v Speaker 1>didn't exactly say it but not have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still lady's grabbing just throttle </v>

148
00:05:50.491 --> 00:05:51.730
<v Speaker 1>punch through the plastic and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>insane,</v>

149
00:05:51.731 --> 00:05:53.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

150
00:05:53.351 --> 00:05:54.820
<v Speaker 1>It is kind of insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Insane.</v>

151
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:55.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

152
00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:56.920
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucked up job.</v>

153
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.220
<v Speaker 2>That's a weird gray area sport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think a lot of it is also because </v>

154
00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:04.250
<v Speaker 2>it's Canadian Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're just them.</v>

155
00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.070
<v Speaker 2>There's more men up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll give you,</v>

156
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:08.070
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

157
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.340
<v Speaker 2>It's like there's a lot of policies in </v>
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

158
00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot of men in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of places and there's a lot of </v>

159
00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.560
<v Speaker 2>posts and in Canada I think fistfights </v>
<v Speaker 2>or moral or a normal thing like think </v>

160
00:06:19.101 --> 00:06:24.101
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're back pre biblical and we're in a </v>

161
00:06:24.101 --> 00:06:24.560
<v Speaker 2>political sciences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

162
00:06:24.561 --> 00:06:27.350
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna throw my head in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cool,</v>

163
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.440
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And all of these policies you think so </v>

164
00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:32.680
<v Speaker 2>many women,</v>
<v Speaker 2>us,</v>

165
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:37.750
<v Speaker 2>Alpha males would have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would just go and like I think I'm </v>

166
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:37.750
<v Speaker 2>gonna take your girl and just beat his </v>
<v Speaker 2>ass.</v>

167
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.700
<v Speaker 2>And the problem with that is you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>never fucking sleep those days man.</v>

168
00:06:40.701 --> 00:06:44.300
<v Speaker 2>Like the old days and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you never sleep,</v>

169
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:49.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would hear footsteps you like all </v>

170
00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:49.330
<v Speaker 2>fucking great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look out your window.</v>

171
00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:50.770
<v Speaker 2>There's a thousand dudes coming over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hill.</v>

172
00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:51.120
<v Speaker 2>I just did.</v>

173
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:59.020
<v Speaker 2>But those wish a motherfucker would days</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Mongols that fucking just shooting </v>

174
00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.191
<v Speaker 2>arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one has a gun and fucking launching </v>

175
00:07:03.191 --> 00:07:04.120
<v Speaker 2>people on catapults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those kind of three big we have,</v>

176
00:07:04.121 --> 00:07:05.330
<v Speaker 2>you know we got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have,</v>

177
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:08.870
<v Speaker 2>maybe they just barely came with arrows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Swords definitely.</v>

178
00:07:08.871 --> 00:07:10.940
<v Speaker 2>But what do they figure out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arrows,</v>

179
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:16.360
<v Speaker 2>like all those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the arrows are on the hieroglyphs </v>

180
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.791
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's like 2000 BC at least because </v>

181
00:07:18.791 --> 00:07:22.010
<v Speaker 2>I think the pyramid is 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 2>BC.</v>

182
00:07:22.011 --> 00:07:27.011
<v Speaker 2>I think they dated that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think if you're talking about when </v>

183
00:07:27.011 --> 00:07:31.310
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the invention of the arrows should </v>

184
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:31.310
<v Speaker 2>probably know this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should know this,</v>

185
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:33.960
<v Speaker 2>but I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

186
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:35.810
<v Speaker 2>So long ass time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

187
00:07:35.811 --> 00:07:38.000
<v Speaker 2>They figured out a few things first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

188
00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:41.660
<v Speaker 2>They figured out like spears and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>they figured out catapults.</v>

189
00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:46.661
<v Speaker 2>Probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was probably the next boat trip </v>

190
00:07:46.661 --> 00:07:46.661
<v Speaker 2>trebuchet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

191
00:07:46.661 --> 00:07:50.310
<v Speaker 2>Trevor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that trip is not a catapult </v>

192
00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:50.330
<v Speaker 2>trebuchet and though is called a </v>
<v Speaker 2>trebuchet.</v>

193
00:07:50.630 --> 00:07:53.750
<v Speaker 2>Can you google it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trebuchet.</v>

194
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:57.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Should I be Shay?</v>

195
00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.970
<v Speaker 2>That was fucking quit google.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not bad trebuchet.</v>

196
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:03.110
<v Speaker 2>That's the original Caterpillar fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling me,</v>

197
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:06.710
<v Speaker 2>son.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

198
00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:11.740
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even it's even spelled the way you </v>

199
00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:11.740
<v Speaker 2>pronounced it.</v>

200
00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:16.340
<v Speaker 2>Loose lip shade with a mouthful of </v>
<v Speaker 2>school.</v>

201
00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:21.480
<v Speaker 2>What do you got there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that stuff a Copenhagen long </v>

202
00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:21.480
<v Speaker 2>cut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wintergreen.</v>

203
00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:21.800
<v Speaker 2>Dangerous for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that bad for you?</v>

204
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.980
<v Speaker 2>Probably not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any more dangerous than marijuana.</v>

205
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:26.390
<v Speaker 2>Marijuana is not dangerous for you at </v>
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>

206
00:08:26.391 --> 00:08:27.110
<v Speaker 2>How dare you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sir?</v>

207
00:08:27.111 --> 00:08:32.111
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel like that is either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put that stuff does not like chew </v>

208
00:08:32.111 --> 00:08:36.041
<v Speaker 2>people's faces off and shit because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's one dude who shows up at a </v>

209
00:08:36.041 --> 00:08:40.150
<v Speaker 2>little kid schools to warn them of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangers of chewing tobacco in his </v>

210
00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:41.660
<v Speaker 2>missing half his face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember that dude on TV.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't mean to freak you out when I'm </v>

212

<v Speaker 2>going out with my boots on babies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

<v Speaker 2>astronaut thing you got there.</v>

218
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:56.660
<v Speaker 2>Don't need to shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going in head first.</v>

219
00:08:56.661 --> 00:08:59.760
<v Speaker 2>They'll bring it off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

220
00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.950
<v Speaker 2>That's my mentality though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joey.</v>

221
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.470
<v Speaker 2>Like if I got in a car accident and lost</v>
<v Speaker 2>a leg or an arm,</v>

222
00:09:04.471 --> 00:09:05.530
<v Speaker 2>I'd just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd tell him,</v>

225
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:09.600
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be tough.</v>

226
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:12.030
<v Speaker 2>It'd be tough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They got some good prosthetics now.</v>

227
00:09:12.031 --> 00:09:14.460
<v Speaker 2>A lot of these guys that come back from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Iraq and Afghanistan,</v>

228
00:09:14.461 --> 00:09:15.960
<v Speaker 2>they do marathons now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Poor.</v>

229
00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:17.730
<v Speaker 2>Let me credit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible.</v>

230
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:21.810
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

231
00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:23.010
<v Speaker 2>It really is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

232
00:09:23.011 --> 00:09:24.900
<v Speaker 2>But God damn it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You'd be,</v>

234
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:29.330
<v Speaker 2>you were real close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a couple things.</v>

235
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:34.360
<v Speaker 2>They sequence the gene of the flatworm </v>
<v Speaker 2>recently and they're looking to try to </v>

236
00:09:34.471 --> 00:09:36.510
<v Speaker 2>figure out because of flatworms can </v>
<v Speaker 2>regenerate.</v>

237
00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:41.780
<v Speaker 2>Like he'd cut them in half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They become two completely different </v>

238
00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.070
<v Speaker 2>flatworms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they also have the same </v>

239
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:46.221
<v Speaker 2>memories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if one flatworm knows where the </v>

240
00:09:46.221 --> 00:09:47.640
<v Speaker 2>food is and you cut them in half of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>both halves know where the food is.</v>

241
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:52.910
<v Speaker 2>So it's very confusing to them because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to figure out what is </v>

242
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:52.910
<v Speaker 2>that memory or is that just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

243
00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:57.460
<v Speaker 2>like lawyers and it's good question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think specifically the w,</v>

244
00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:00.360
<v Speaker 2>what they know and the way they know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what they believed that it's a memory,</v>

245
00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:03.030
<v Speaker 2>some type of a memory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obviously a crude memory,</v>

246
00:10:03.390 --> 00:10:05.220
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they think that they're going to be able</v>

247
00:10:05.221 --> 00:10:08.800
<v Speaker 2>to figure out whether the next hundred </v>
<v Speaker 2>years how to replace limbs that you,</v>

248
00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:10.020
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be able to regenerate </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

249
00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.880
<v Speaker 2>The way of frog does or an alligator </v>
<v Speaker 2>does.</v>

250
00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:15.570
<v Speaker 2>Think about that next 100 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about what,</v>

251
00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:17.910
<v Speaker 2>think about this iphone six year and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>next.</v>

252
00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:23.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember the flip phone and the </v>

253
00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.170
<v Speaker 2>texting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were so happy with it too,</v>

254
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:26.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking of that,</v>

255
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:27.810
<v Speaker 2>do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have kids,</v>

256
00:10:27.811 --> 00:10:30.350
<v Speaker 2>so do you remember when you were 15,</v>
<v Speaker 2>16 years?</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

268
00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:58.100

<v Speaker 2>middle of nowhere and that's way I can </v>

269

<v Speaker 2>get Internet.</v>

270
00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:01.080

<v Speaker 2>I'd have to start the download before I </v>

277

<v Speaker 2>went to bed and maybe by noon the next </v>

<v Speaker 2>online for a flight.</v>

280
00:11:27.990 --> 00:11:30.320
<v Speaker 2>Netflix is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Netflix?</v>

281
00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:33.120
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we cannot load a Netflix.</v>

282
00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.380
<v Speaker 2>They have satellite Internet now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody know.</v>

283
00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:37.920
<v Speaker 2>You can get it all over the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

285
00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:39.240

<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

286
00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:44.360
<v Speaker 2>just like direct TV,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just point the dish with the </v>

287
00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.750
<v Speaker 2>satellite in the sky and it's not fast </v>
<v Speaker 2>as like a fiber optic,</v>

288
00:11:45.751 --> 00:11:47.490
<v Speaker 2>but it's pretty fast when you look into </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

289
00:11:47.491 --> 00:11:48.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to get that.</v>

290
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.750
<v Speaker 2>What I got going on is that's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>biblical.</v>

291
00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:52.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds.</v>

292
00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:53.890
<v Speaker 2>That sounds horrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You like</v>

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:55.840
<v Speaker 1>you live in like a couple of decades </v>

00:11:56.150 --> 00:12:01.150
<v Speaker 1>I am and there's nothing they can do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't lay wires or anything like </v>

295
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:02.970
<v Speaker 1>that now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have.</v>

296
00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:05.110
<v Speaker 1>They don't have it out there in my area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've tried.</v>

297
00:12:05.111 --> 00:12:07.120
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to look into that satellite </v>
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>

300
00:12:10.781 --> 00:12:15.781
<v Speaker 1>Albuquerque.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're there because of Jackson's </v>

301
00:12:15.781 --> 00:12:15.781
<v Speaker 1>because you could be close to Jackson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

302
00:12:15.781 --> 00:12:17.920
<v Speaker 1>I moved to Albuquerque to help Linda </v>
<v Speaker 1>Garcia with the Roger Ward to fight.</v>

303
00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:19.810
<v Speaker 1>And I never left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I literally called my grandma,</v>

304
00:12:19.811 --> 00:12:21.460
<v Speaker 1>my grandma she's watching right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>

00:13:54.361 --> 00:13:56.860
<v Speaker 1>that I got in Edgewood to buy in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Colorado would have been out of control.</v>

351
00:13:56.920 --> 00:13:57.580
<v Speaker 1>Outrageous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

352
00:13:57.581 --> 00:13:59.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I told my grandfather is where I want to</v>

353
00:13:59.241 --> 00:14:01.120
<v Speaker 1>went.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My grandfather said done.</v>

354
00:14:01.121 --> 00:14:02.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a phone call.</v>

355
00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.540
<v Speaker 1>My grandpa said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>done just what you want.</v>

356
00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:05.550
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drove down with cash in hand,</v>

357
00:14:05.570 --> 00:14:07.610
<v Speaker 1>bought me the property just slightly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

358
00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:10.360
<v Speaker 1>It was the greatest dude on the planet </v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

359
00:14:10.361 --> 00:14:10.930
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

360
00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.260
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I started training there and him and</v>

361
00:14:13.261 --> 00:14:16.930
<v Speaker 1>my grandma would come down and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking curiosity now.</v>

362
00:14:16.931 --> 00:14:18.790
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

363
00:14:18.791 --> 00:14:20.830
<v Speaker 1>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like a dream for me.</v>

364
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:25.860
<v Speaker 1>And so now now I'm rooted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so did you build out there?</v>

365
00:14:27.731 --> 00:14:29.940
<v Speaker 1>Was there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was there a structure to there?</v>

366
00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.100
<v Speaker 1>There was a house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

367
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:33.130
<v Speaker 1>And we extended the house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>built the gym,</v>

368
00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.830
<v Speaker 1>now I just built dorms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which,</v>

369
00:14:35.910 --> 00:14:37.840
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to build anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone listening,</v>

370
00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:43.140
<v Speaker 1>make sure you get permits because I of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course didn't because I'm a fucking </v>

371
00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:43.140
<v Speaker 1>idiot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>loser.</v>

372
00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:46.860
<v Speaker 1>And a wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I got a big red flag notice on my </v>

373
00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:46.860
<v Speaker 1>door.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Said,</v>

374
00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:46.860
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get your permits done.</v>

375
00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:47.650
<v Speaker 1>Got a picture here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to see it?</v>

376
00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:48.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do want to say it.</v>

377
00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:51.260
<v Speaker 1>So what do they do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it delay you any further?</v>

378
00:14:51.261 --> 00:14:53.890
<v Speaker 1>Because it's a cease and assist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>

379
00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:54.720
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

380
00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:56.510
<v Speaker 1>well they don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Jesus.</v>

381
00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:01.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well notice the stop.</v>

382
00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:03.110
<v Speaker 1>Stop work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bam.</v>

383
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:04.840
<v Speaker 1>So I had to jump through hoops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

384
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:07.760
<v Speaker 1>go hire hiring one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to spend all day.</v>

385
00:15:07.761 --> 00:15:11.270
<v Speaker 1>I had to go to the Santa Fe county and </v>
<v Speaker 1>really like get everything in line,</v>

386
00:15:11.271 --> 00:15:12.740
<v Speaker 1>show my plans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blah blah blah.</v>

387
00:15:12.770 --> 00:15:15.680
<v Speaker 1>Pay The money and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically get the ball rolling for the,</v>

388
00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:16.400
<v Speaker 1>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

389
00:15:16.550 --> 00:15:18.500
<v Speaker 1>for the performance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got it done now.</v>

390
00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:23.580
<v Speaker 1>So there's places out here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you want to build something in </v>

391
00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:24.470
<v Speaker 1>like Malibu near the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes fucking years and you got to go</v>

392
00:15:24.471 --> 00:15:27.200
<v Speaker 1>through all sorts of red tape and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>corruption and nonsense.</v>

393
00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.470
<v Speaker 1>You have to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

394
00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:32.900
<v Speaker 1>So I just felt it and I shouldn't have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a buddy lives in Topanga.</v>

395
00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:35.510
<v Speaker 1>He's under the coastal commission and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>just said,</v>

396
00:15:35.511 --> 00:15:36.650
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they catch me,</v>

397
00:15:36.651 --> 00:15:39.170
<v Speaker 1>they catch me and he just built up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did all this shit to his house.</v>

398
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:41.720
<v Speaker 1>It's been a fuck load of money on his </v>
<v Speaker 1>house and just got away with it,</v>

399
00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:43.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can get away with it.</v>

400
00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:48.830
<v Speaker 1>He can with wires hanging out of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>wall,</v>

401
00:15:48.831 --> 00:15:53.390
<v Speaker 1>stop work to get fined and then never </v>
<v Speaker 1>get permits for years.</v>

402
00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:54.770
<v Speaker 1>So I tried to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

403
00:15:54.771 --> 00:15:58.660
<v Speaker 1>let people learn from my mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm kind of learning trial by fire,</v>

404
00:15:58.890 --> 00:16:03.890
<v Speaker 1>kind of how I've lived my whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how many dorms did you build out </v>

405
00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:03.890
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

406
00:16:03.890 --> 00:16:05.660
<v Speaker 1>well as of right now it's a glorified </v>
<v Speaker 1>horse.</v>

407
00:16:05.661 --> 00:16:06.830
<v Speaker 1>Stable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

408
00:16:06.831 --> 00:16:11.831
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no dorms being built because of </v>

409
00:16:11.831 --> 00:16:11.920
<v Speaker 1>the work stoppage.</v>

410
00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:14.390
<v Speaker 1>Stopped a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a way to get a permit again.</v>

411
00:16:14.450 --> 00:16:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now it's a,</v>

412
00:16:15.410 --> 00:16:17.300
<v Speaker 1>it's a horse that because there was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>horse stable underneath,</v>

413
00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:18.470
<v Speaker 1>giant horse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stable.</v>

414
00:16:18.471 --> 00:16:23.471
<v Speaker 1>And then I built a rooms that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably going to paint in holding the </v>

415
00:16:23.471 --> 00:16:27.881
<v Speaker 1>archery gear in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a whole bunch of beds that I need </v>

416
00:16:27.881 --> 00:16:29.630
<v Speaker 1>a store and in a couple and I got guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>that come out that'll probably store and</v>

417
00:16:29.631 --> 00:16:34.631
<v Speaker 1>some of those rooms with two beds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that this is what's going </v>

418
00:16:34.631 --> 00:16:37.901
<v Speaker 1>to be your transition after you're done </v>
<v Speaker 1>finding that you'll eventually just run </v>

419
00:16:37.901 --> 00:16:37.901
<v Speaker 1>a camp?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know Joe,</v>

420
00:16:37.901 --> 00:16:38.360
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

421
00:16:38.420 --> 00:16:43.420
<v Speaker 1>teaching to me like if you and I were </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing something I could show you </v>

422
00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.540
<v Speaker 1>something you had a problem with for me </v>
<v Speaker 1>to like come in and teach a class and be</v>

423
00:16:45.541 --> 00:16:48.290
<v Speaker 1>really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how that fucking even works</v>

424
00:16:48.291 --> 00:16:48.650
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

425
00:16:48.650 --> 00:16:49.890
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at that time,</v>

426
00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:54.950
<v Speaker 1>what would it be hard about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe getting a curriculum or </v>

427
00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:55.700
<v Speaker 1>something thei thought out like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>for my boat.</v>

632
00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:49.370
<v Speaker 1>Now had this not been the situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in,</v>

633
00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:52.700
<v Speaker 1>I would have congratulated this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do for the most epic fucking water spray</v>

634
00:24:52.770 --> 00:24:56.180
<v Speaker 1>I've ever seen thrown into another </v>
<v Speaker 1>person's boat because at the last second</v>

635
00:24:56.181 --> 00:25:01.181
<v Speaker 1>he cuts and throws the most massive wave</v>
<v Speaker 1>that just drench is everyone's phone and</v>

636
00:25:01.221 --> 00:25:03.710
<v Speaker 1>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like he hits you like a tidal wave and I</v>

637
00:25:03.711 --> 00:25:05.270
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was fucking pissed.</v>

638
00:25:05.270 --> 00:25:10.270
<v Speaker 1>So I tried boat to the shore and I get </v>
<v Speaker 1>off the boat and I run about 200 yards </v>

639
00:25:10.270 --> 00:25:14.570
<v Speaker 1>down the shore trying to get him to come</v>
<v Speaker 1>to me because my girl stood up and she's</v>

640
00:25:14.571 --> 00:25:15.440
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's fucking it.</v>

641
00:25:15.441 --> 00:25:16.730
<v Speaker 1>And that's all I had to hear when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt,</v>

642
00:25:16.731 --> 00:25:17.930
<v Speaker 1>when she stood up and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's like,</v>

643
00:25:17.931 --> 00:25:19.670
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

644
00:25:19.671 --> 00:25:20.510
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>

645
00:25:20.590 --> 00:25:21.560
<v Speaker 1>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all I need to know.</v>

646
00:25:21.620 --> 00:25:22.040
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

647
00:25:22.670 --> 00:25:24.050
<v Speaker 1>So I tried to get this dude to run to </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

648
00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:29.030
<v Speaker 1>He does not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He comes straight from my girl,</v>

649
00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:31.340
<v Speaker 1>gets off his boat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pointing his finger at her,</v>

650
00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:36.930

<v Speaker 1>A lot of crazy gorilla pounding the dude</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the sand is going through my mind.</v>

654
00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:49.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't always trained myself and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dude gets up and tries to hit me with </v>

655
00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:50.050

<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>

698
00:27:35.861 --> 00:27:38.370
<v Speaker 4>I'm not exaggerating that didn't I just </v>
<v Speaker 4>haul off and beat him down?</v>

699
00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.100
<v Speaker 4>Which I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking I'm maturing in my,</v>

700
00:27:41.101 --> 00:27:42.420
<v Speaker 4>in my water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You aren't mature.</v>

701
00:27:42.421 --> 00:27:46.500
<v Speaker 4>I am going to tell you that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just amazing how people will try to</v>

702
00:27:46.501 --> 00:27:51.501
<v Speaker 4>sue over things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that becomes like the lottery to </v>

703
00:27:51.501 --> 00:27:51.900
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know the two guys sued?</v>

704
00:27:51.910 --> 00:27:56.910
<v Speaker 4>The people always ask that came in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can you take a picture choking me like </v>

705
00:27:56.910 --> 00:27:58.740
<v Speaker 4>the UFC doesn't want anybody choking </v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody in pictures.</v>

706
00:27:58.741 --> 00:28:02.790
<v Speaker 4>I've been told that I tell them no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Matt Hughes were both sued.</v>

707
00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:07.970
<v Speaker 4>The Matthew story is kind of hilarious </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the guy asked Matt he to put </v>

708
00:28:07.970 --> 00:28:08.040
<v Speaker 4>them in a rear naked choke for picture.</v>

709
00:28:08.130 --> 00:28:10.230
<v Speaker 4>So Matt Hughes does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the guy says,</v>

710
00:28:10.231 --> 00:28:15.231
<v Speaker 4>hey look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got evidence has got choked me and he </v>

711
00:28:15.231 --> 00:28:15.231
<v Speaker 4>hurt me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he tries to sue.</v>

712
00:28:15.231 --> 00:28:16.860
<v Speaker 4>Well they do an investigation on the guy</v>
<v Speaker 4>and find out the guy's a cop.</v>

713
00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:22.060
<v Speaker 4>Then they dig deeper and find out he's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>dirty cop and the dude wants up getting </v>

714
00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:25.530
<v Speaker 4>popped and goes to jail because of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the chocolate Dell one,</v>

715
00:28:25.531 --> 00:28:29.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure chuck had to wind up </v>
<v Speaker 4>paying something like three times,</v>

716
00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:31.140
<v Speaker 4>three times,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three times,</v>

717
00:28:31.141 --> 00:28:34.140
<v Speaker 4>three times they've been sued them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And my neighbor,</v>

718
00:28:34.141 --> 00:28:37.690
<v Speaker 4>I'm sued me for what he said that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

719
00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:39.210
<v Speaker 4>my dogs attacked his horse.</v>

720
00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:43.800
<v Speaker 4>Did they know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely not.</v>

721
00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.800
<v Speaker 4>Some body else's dog did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he was a neighbor.</v>

722
00:28:46.801 --> 00:28:50.340
<v Speaker 4>So we said mind to guy just moved in and</v>
<v Speaker 4>his horse ran through the fence.</v>

723
00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:55.790
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're any kind of a horse owner at </v>

724
00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:58.531
<v Speaker 4>all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't just move into somewhere and </v>

725
00:28:58.531 --> 00:28:58.531
<v Speaker 4>take the reins up your horse and let him</v>
<v Speaker 4>go.</v>

726
00:28:58.531 --> 00:28:59.850
<v Speaker 4>We have no idea what the perimeter you </v>
<v Speaker 4>need.</v>

727
00:28:59.851 --> 00:29:01.440
<v Speaker 4>You need to take your horse out and walk</v>
<v Speaker 4>the perimeter.</v>

728
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:03.540
<v Speaker 4>He lets his horse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the horse runs through the fence.</v>

729
00:29:03.541 --> 00:29:05.160
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and my dogs chased him to the fence.</v>

730
00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:10.840
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was cheaper for me just to pay the </v>

731
00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:10.840
<v Speaker 4>guy off than to go to court and fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

732
00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:14.610
<v Speaker 4>So it's just unbelievable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

733
00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:17.040
<v Speaker 4>That kind of shit drives me fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>

734
00:29:17.041 --> 00:29:19.860
<v Speaker 4>In my old roommate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>me and Leonard Garcia used to live in.</v>

735
00:29:19.861 --> 00:29:21.420
<v Speaker 4>We'd have guys come down for training </v>
<v Speaker 4>camp.</v>

736
00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:26.720
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this lady got as good man after we,</v>

737
00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.250
<v Speaker 4>after when I bought this new house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we moved in.</v>

738
00:29:29.251 --> 00:29:34.251
<v Speaker 4>She then claimed students that we were </v>
<v Speaker 4>subleasing are ran out to our training </v>

00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:39.350
<v Speaker 4>Why 12,000?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gives a fuck.</v>

741
00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:41.800
<v Speaker 4>I don't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She must've been hurting for money.</v>

742
00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:46.480
<v Speaker 3>So she was years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She owned the house at one point.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He used to work for Jackson's Greg </v>

744
00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:52.870
<v Speaker 1>Jackson's guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably would if I saw him anyway.</v>

745
00:29:52.871 --> 00:29:54.630
<v Speaker 1>So the ladies hurting for money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

747
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:57.720
<v Speaker 1>her house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the house she's living in.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I use her as my realtor to buy my ranch.</v>

754
00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:14.370
<v Speaker 1>That's how fucking crazy this gets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

755
00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:17.660
<v Speaker 1>So I use her or we do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soon as we get the paperwork done,</v>

756
00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:20.220
<v Speaker 1>she turns around and sues us for </v>
<v Speaker 1>subleasing are ran out.</v>

757
00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:23.430
<v Speaker 1>And my grandma's honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can vouch for this fucking crazy.</v>

758
00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:28.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said that the whole time we were </v>

759
00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.141
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we were having people come down to </v>

760
00:30:30.141 --> 00:30:30.141
<v Speaker 1>training.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>

761
00:30:30.141 --> 00:30:32.420
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're renting it out to them and making </v>

762
00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:32.420
<v Speaker 1>money off of her property.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

763
00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:33.870
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course I got the notices to go to</v>

764
00:30:33.871 --> 00:30:34.920
<v Speaker 1>court.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't show up to court.</v>

765
00:30:34.921 --> 00:30:35.410
<v Speaker 1>So they passed.</v>

766
00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:41.280
<v Speaker 3>Brian could have fought it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I did.</v>

767
00:30:41.281 --> 00:30:41.950
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

768
00:30:41.951 --> 00:30:42.880
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you do,</v>

769
00:30:42.881 --> 00:30:47.881
<v Speaker 3>that takes forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem with those things is it's </v>

770
00:30:47.881 --> 00:30:47.881
<v Speaker 3>like these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

771
00:30:47.881 --> 00:30:48.360
<v Speaker 3>blake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know what a patent troll is?</v>

772
00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:52.270
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] patent trolls are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They get patents on things.</v>

773
00:30:52.271 --> 00:30:55.830
<v Speaker 3>They buy up patents and patents and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll sue like a,</v>

774
00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:57.520
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a company like apple,</v>

775
00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:02.850
<v Speaker 3>like they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were going to have to podcasters </v>

776
00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:05.430
<v Speaker 3>for awhile and what they do is they'll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they went after Adam Carolla for </v>

777
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:05.430
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>

778
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:08.530
<v Speaker 3>some sort of sort of patent and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>went after a few other people,</v>

779
00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:13.620
<v Speaker 3>but apple had a wound up paying like 7 </v>
<v Speaker 3>million bucks or something like that </v>

780
00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:13.750
<v Speaker 3>because for apple to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

781
00:31:13.751 --> 00:31:16.930
<v Speaker 3>they have so much fucking money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's easier for them to pay off a patent</v>

782
00:31:16.931 --> 00:31:21.931
<v Speaker 3>troll than it is to address it in court </v>
<v Speaker 3>and spent all their resources and you </v>

783
00:31:21.970 --> 00:31:24.070
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they might like the UFC is doing this,</v>

784
00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:29.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the antitrust lawsuit that like this is </v>

785
00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:29.860
<v Speaker 3>going to cost them $100,</v>
<v Speaker 3>million dollars in legal fees.</v>

786
00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:34.060
<v Speaker 3>But it's either that or pay people off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd rather spend the money.</v>

787
00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:36.240
<v Speaker 3>They'd rather pay the legal fees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

788
00:31:36.770 --> 00:31:38.350
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because principle for them.</v>

789
00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.650
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>principle and also sets a precedent.</v>

790
00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:42.990
<v Speaker 3>And you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

791
00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:45.940
<v Speaker 3>if you start paying out then other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people start coming out of the woodwork.</v>

792
00:31:45.941 --> 00:31:50.941
<v Speaker 3>But what's a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a weird world we live in where you </v>

793
00:31:50.941 --> 00:31:52.480
<v Speaker 3>can just sue over shit like that Alpha </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain.</v>

794
00:31:52.481 --> 00:31:54.580
<v Speaker 3>So brain size.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Man with the balance was good.</v>

799
00:32:05.831 --> 00:32:08.600
<v Speaker 3>But the whole thing done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

800
00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:10.990
<v Speaker 3>it was suspended.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you pull that off?</v>

801
00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.470
<v Speaker 3>Because I'm fucking super athletic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alpha.</v>

00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:23.660
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when we were at elevate,</v>

<v Speaker 4>wakeboarding and go,</v>

1017
00:40:50.131 --> 00:40:51.280

<v Speaker 4>why not?</v>

1018
00:40:51.281 --> 00:40:54.250
<v Speaker 4>So you just kinda treat it like it's any</v>
<v Speaker 4>other ordinary life.</v>

1019
00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:59.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because back in the day when I used to </v>

1020
00:40:59.400 --> 00:40:59.400
<v Speaker 4>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he'd be on two,</v>

1021
00:40:59.400 --> 00:40:59.400
<v Speaker 4>three days notice I had nothing to worry</v>
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>

1022
00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:03.000
<v Speaker 4>It's just a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But what do you worry about an incident </v>

1023
00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.271
<v Speaker 4>happening?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the incident that kept you from </v>

1024
00:41:06.271 --> 00:41:06.271
<v Speaker 4>going and fighting for the King of </v>
<v Speaker 4>Thailand.</v>

1025
00:41:06.271 --> 00:41:06.271
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1026
00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:11.280
<v Speaker 4>that's the real,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the big thing is to win the </v>

1027
00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:11.280
<v Speaker 4>title,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1028
00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:11.950
<v Speaker 4>The most guys when they get to your </v>
<v Speaker 4>position,</v>

1029
00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:17.190
<v Speaker 4>they kind of start playing it safe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the difference between you and a </v>

1030
00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:19.210
<v Speaker 4>lot of these guys because a lot of guys </v>
<v Speaker 4>are wild in the beginning,</v>

1031
00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:23.710
<v Speaker 4>but then somewhere along the line they </v>
<v Speaker 4>start realizing the consequences and the</v>

1032
00:41:23.711 --> 00:41:25.990
<v Speaker 4>stakes and they start playing it safe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1033
00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:27.640
<v Speaker 4>I just start to play it safe kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>guy.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I could go.</v>

1035
00:41:28.510 --> 00:41:31.150
<v Speaker 4>I could go wakeboarding the week of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight and blow my knee out.</v>

1036
00:41:31.450 --> 00:41:34.580

00:41:57.581 --> 00:41:57.860
<v Speaker 4>surgeries other than the stomach?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1045
00:41:57.890 --> 00:41:59.930
<v Speaker 4>no surgeries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Amazing.</v>

1046
00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:01.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In fact,</v>

1047
00:42:01.491 --> 00:42:03.030
<v Speaker 4>in front of the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>before the uh,</v>

1048
00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:04.930
<v Speaker 4>my last fight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1049
00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:10.260
<v Speaker 4>I supposed to get an Mri on my knees and</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had an MRI of my chest because my </v>

1050
00:42:10.260 --> 00:42:13.430
<v Speaker 4>fucking ribs are so separated and I made</v>
<v Speaker 4>it very crystal clear to the EFC.</v>

1051
00:42:13.431 --> 00:42:18.431
<v Speaker 4>I will go get this MRI,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but regardless of the outcome it comes.</v>

1052
00:42:19.401 --> 00:42:20.960
<v Speaker 4>I'm still fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that okay with you guys?</v>

1053
00:42:20.961 --> 00:42:22.400
<v Speaker 4>And it was long and they said yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I was like,</v>

1054
00:42:22.401 --> 00:42:24.020
<v Speaker 4>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They wanted you to get an Mri.</v>

1055
00:42:24.030 --> 00:42:26.140
<v Speaker 4>You wanted to get a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wanted me to want to do together.</v>

1056
00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:31.360
<v Speaker 4>So you were complaining of some pain </v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe or you're realizing there's </v>

1057
00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:32.240
<v Speaker 4>something wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like my chest was super separated,</v>

1058
00:42:32.241 --> 00:42:33.890
<v Speaker 4>like I couldn't even take a bridge pop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pop,</v>

1059
00:42:33.891 --> 00:42:35.920
<v Speaker 4>pop like in my solar plexus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So uh,</v>

1060
00:42:36.950 --> 00:42:41.950
<v Speaker 4>went to Dallas and I went and trained </v>
<v Speaker 4>with some kids in the gym and the dude </v>

1061
00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:45.260
<v Speaker 4>through a knee with no Shin Pad and just</v>
<v Speaker 4>crushed me and my solar blacks and like </v>

1062
00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:49.010
<v Speaker 4>separated it bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So like what fight was this for the law?</v>

1063
00:42:49.290 --> 00:42:51.260
<v Speaker 4>Midecky fight.</v>

1065
00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:57.190
<v Speaker 4>I am the one who is supposed to be with </v>
<v Speaker 4>qbe that he pulled out for the third </v>

1066
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.620
<v Speaker 4>fucking time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that guy gets hurt a lot.</v>

1067
00:42:58.150 --> 00:42:59.630
<v Speaker 4>These are all fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucked up.</v>

1068
00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:02.920
<v Speaker 4>A lot of those guys that are fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>cane,</v>

1069
00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:08.220
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of those fucking guys are super </v>

1070
00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:09.020
<v Speaker 4>strong mentally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just ridiculously aggressive.</v>

1071
00:43:09.410 --> 00:43:11.180
<v Speaker 4>Those guys wind up blowing shit out.</v>

1072
00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:13.740
<v Speaker 4>Like canes blown out his knees,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bone on his shoulder.</v>

1073
00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:16.900
<v Speaker 4>Both shoulders had surgeries on him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck yeah.</v>

1074
00:43:16.970 --> 00:43:20.570
<v Speaker 4>That style of fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially that intense grappling style,</v>

1075
00:43:20.650 --> 00:43:25.650
<v Speaker 4>like you just weighed less injuries and </v>
<v Speaker 4>kickboxing and then stand up striking </v>

1076
00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:30.040
<v Speaker 4>like boxing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many fucking fights get canceled in </v>

1077
00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.410
<v Speaker 4>boxing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's rare as fuck man.</v>

1078
00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:34.410
<v Speaker 4>Fight Mayweather.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

1079
00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:35.380
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't pull it.</v>

1080
00:43:35.381 --> 00:43:36.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>almost.</v>

1081
00:43:36.170 --> 00:43:38.930
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember a big fight ever.</v>

1082
00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:44.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean it would have to be something </v>
<v Speaker 4>severe and usually it's like doing </v>

1083
00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:45.380
<v Speaker 4>during strength and conditioning </v>
<v Speaker 4>training or something,</v>

1084
00:43:45.430 --> 00:43:47.640
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or running or something maybe.</v>

1085
00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:52.960
<v Speaker 4>But it's very rare that someone pulls </v>
<v Speaker 4>out of a bar or they'd have to break </v>

1086
00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:53.270
<v Speaker 4>their hand or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's rare.</v>

1087
00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:55.120
<v Speaker 4>But in MMA,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Goddamn,</v>

1088
00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:56.170
<v Speaker 4>it's common,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fuck,</v>

1089
00:43:56.210 --> 00:43:59.150
<v Speaker 4>there's so many weird scrambling </v>
<v Speaker 4>situations that you get involved in,</v>

1090
00:43:59.151 --> 00:44:04.151
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>within you bring in guys to train with </v>

1091
00:44:04.151 --> 00:44:04.151
<v Speaker 4>and sometimes those guys.</v>

1092
00:44:04.151 --> 00:44:08.620
<v Speaker 4>That's the other thing that what you </v>
<v Speaker 4>just said to bringing in guys to train </v>

1093
00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:11.501
<v Speaker 4>with man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that is one of the biggest </v>

1094
00:44:11.501 --> 00:44:11.501
<v Speaker 4>mistakes that guys make is that these </v>
<v Speaker 4>young guys,</v>

1095
00:44:11.501 --> 00:44:13.220
<v Speaker 4>they bring into camp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't even know these guys.</v>

1096
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:15.220
<v Speaker 4>These guys tried to make a name look at.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I just don't think it's wise to </v>

1148
00:46:19.580 --> 00:46:19.920
<v Speaker 3>communicate with people that are just </v>
<v Speaker 3>insulting online.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you what you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I as much as he talked,</v>

1273
00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:37.070
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like,</v>

1274
00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:38.720
<v Speaker 4>like those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like them too.</v>

1275
00:51:38.740 --> 00:51:42.020
<v Speaker 4>I really do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean because there is no front on them</v>

1276
00:51:42.021 --> 00:51:47.021
<v Speaker 4>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They are what you see is what you would </v>

1277
00:51:47.021 --> 00:51:47.630
<v Speaker 4>like if I were to run into the Diaz </v>
<v Speaker 4>brothers out in the street.</v>

1278
00:51:47.631 --> 00:51:50.060
<v Speaker 4>We're fucking throwing down and there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>no question.</v>

1279
00:51:50.061 --> 00:51:51.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's just who they are.</v>

1280
00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:52.370
<v Speaker 4>I mean they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1281
00:51:52.371 --> 00:51:55.570
<v Speaker 4>so it's not like they put on this front,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this persona that they're big tub.</v>

1282
00:51:55.580 --> 00:51:57.260
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's who they are.</v>

1283
00:51:57.410 --> 00:51:59.430
<v Speaker 4>Twenty four slash 24 slash seven and </v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1284
00:51:59.630 --> 00:52:00.620
<v Speaker 4>it's awesome to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1285
00:52:00.621 --> 00:52:03.660
<v Speaker 4>I think both of them I got nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 4>respect for both.</v>

1286
00:52:03.680 --> 00:52:08.680
<v Speaker 4>So when you guys were all retired or </v>
<v Speaker 4>you'll have a drink together and have a </v>

1287
00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:12.010
<v Speaker 4>drink with them now I don't have any.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have any animosity or any anger </v>

1288
00:52:12.010 --> 00:52:13.280
<v Speaker 4>or hate towards either one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would definitely hang out with both of</v>

1289
00:52:13.281 --> 00:52:13.700
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1290
00:52:13.850 --> 00:52:16.370
<v Speaker 4>and it sucks that fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1291
00:52:16.371 --> 00:52:20.390
<v Speaker 4>nick is in trouble with this whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>marijuana thing and it was awful.</v>

1292
00:52:20.810 --> 00:52:25.810
<v Speaker 4>It's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it just shows how bad the Nevada </v>

1293
00:52:25.810 --> 00:52:28.541
<v Speaker 4>state athletic commission is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they were angry because he took the </v>

1294
00:52:28.541 --> 00:52:31.391
<v Speaker 4>fifth because he didn't want it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fucking guy passed two World Anti </v>

1295
00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:35.840
<v Speaker 4>Doping Agency tests to test are blood </v>
<v Speaker 4>tests that way.</v>

1296
00:52:35.900 --> 00:52:40.900
<v Speaker 4>More accurate than the fucking urine </v>
<v Speaker 4>test that Nevada state athletic </v>

1297
00:52:40.900 --> 00:52:42.110
<v Speaker 4>commission gave him with Quest </v>
<v Speaker 4>Diagnostics,</v>

1298
00:52:42.111 --> 00:52:44.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and nothing against quest diagnostics.</v>

1299
00:52:44.181 --> 00:52:47.240
<v Speaker 4>But that method of testing is not as </v>
<v Speaker 4>accurate.</v>

1300
00:52:47.290 --> 00:52:50.810
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the dude was within the realm.</v>

1301
00:52:50.811 --> 00:52:55.811
<v Speaker 4>I mean he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was legally passed and they try to </v>

1302
00:52:55.811 --> 00:52:58.151
<v Speaker 4>stay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're stealing money from them and </v>

1303
00:52:58.151 --> 00:52:59.681
<v Speaker 4>they suspended him for five years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are fucking kangaroo court that's </v>

1304
00:52:59.681 --> 00:53:00.890
<v Speaker 4>five years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ridiculous.</v>

1305
00:53:01.070 --> 00:53:04.130
<v Speaker 4>At any job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean if I said,</v>

1306
00:53:04.131 --> 00:53:05.720
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're off the air for five years,</v>

1307
00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:10.840
<v Speaker 4>you're fucking ruined man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's five years irrelevant after </v>

1308
00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:12.530
<v Speaker 4>almost a year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you're not,</v>

1309
00:53:12.531 --> 00:53:13.720
<v Speaker 4>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

1310
00:53:13.730 --> 00:53:17.090
<v Speaker 4>he is one of the names in the sport.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>

1311
00:53:17.091 --> 00:53:21.110
<v Speaker 4>But I mean five years he's getting older</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he's like 33 or 34.</v>

1312
00:53:21.140 --> 00:53:22.370
<v Speaker 4>How old is nick now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hold on.</v>

1313
00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:24.830

<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1314
00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:26.160
<v Speaker 4>So five</v>

1315
00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:31.160
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's fucking 37 and he's not doing any </v>

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1319
00:53:34.021 --> 00:53:36.990

1320
00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:41.910
<v Speaker 3>When we were kids,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when a boxer like hit his thirties,</v>

1321
00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:42.690
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1324
00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:50.910
<v Speaker 3>But then the age of trt came along,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially with mma,</v>

1325
00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:52.810
<v Speaker 3>things got real weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these guys,</v>

1330
00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:08.480
<v Speaker 3>the Diaz brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one thing you've got to say about them </v>

1331
00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:08.910
<v Speaker 3>as these fucking dudes take care of </v>
<v Speaker 3>their bodies.</v>

1332
00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:10.400
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they eat healthiest.</v>

1333
00:54:10.410 --> 00:54:13.800
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nick's always eating all organic food.</v>

1334
00:54:13.950 --> 00:54:16.770
<v Speaker 3>He eats really healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's constantly shaped constantly.</v>

1335
00:54:16.771 --> 00:54:19.280
<v Speaker 3>When if this guy is smoking pot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1336
00:54:19.290 --> 00:54:21.330
<v Speaker 3>he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not doing meth.</v>

1337
00:54:22.230 --> 00:54:23.490
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1338
00:54:23.550 --> 00:54:24.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's taking care of his body.</v>

1339
00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:27.450
<v Speaker 3>It,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like he's doing steroids.</v>

1340
00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:32.600
<v Speaker 3>It's not like he's doing something </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's making them freakishly fast or </v>

1341
00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:33.600
<v Speaker 3>ridiculously strong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's actually the complete opposite.</v>

1342
00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:36.810
<v Speaker 3>It's the whole thing is it's so </v>
<v Speaker 3>frustrating,</v>

1343
00:54:36.811 --> 00:54:41.811
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that these clowns have any power over </v>

1344
00:54:41.811 --> 00:54:42.180
<v Speaker 3>people like you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It drives me crazy.</v>

1345
00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:47.360
<v Speaker 3>It drives me crazy that people like you </v>
<v Speaker 3>need these fools that have never been </v>

1346
00:54:47.360 --> 00:54:49.020
<v Speaker 3>punched in the face.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've never been strangled.</v>

1347
00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:54.140
<v Speaker 3>They'd never fought a day in their life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they're the ones that get to decide </v>

1348
00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:54.720
<v Speaker 3>what happens to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1349
00:54:54.721 --> 00:54:59.721
<v Speaker 3>they're the ones who get to tell Nick </v>
<v Speaker 3>Diaz he has to sit out for five years </v>

1350
00:54:59.721 --> 00:55:00.750
<v Speaker 3>and they have the pencil pushers of </v>
<v Speaker 3>American man.</v>

1351
00:55:00.751 --> 00:55:04.260
<v Speaker 3>They're the people that in high school </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't,</v>

1352
00:55:04.540 --> 00:55:05.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like those are,</v>

1353
00:55:05.770 --> 00:55:09.070
<v Speaker 4>those are the guys that now they have </v>
<v Speaker 4>something to prove now.</v>

1354
00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:12.580
<v Speaker 4>Now he's high and mighty,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1355
00:55:12.581 --> 00:55:13.660
<v Speaker 4>and maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

1356
00:55:13.661 --> 00:55:15.730
<v Speaker 4>but there's a lot of pencil pushers that</v>
<v Speaker 4>are good dudes,</v>

1357
00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:17.020
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a good women.</v>

1358
00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:22.200
<v Speaker 4>It's not the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem is people in positions of </v>

1359
00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:22.960
<v Speaker 4>power that are accustomed to that </v>
<v Speaker 4>position of power and then they treat it</v>

1360
00:55:22.961 --> 00:55:26.140
<v Speaker 4>like a fucking king or a queen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're tyrants.</v>

1361
00:55:26.440 --> 00:55:31.440
<v Speaker 4>That's my buddy Scott Parker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was it parked from the avalanche that </v>

1362
00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:35.300

<v Speaker 4>He just actually ran the dairy dairy.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Is that the,</v>

1364
00:55:37.751 --> 00:55:38.800

<v Speaker 4>the forest.</v>

1365
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:43.950
<v Speaker 4>The forest actually you have four sides </v>
<v Speaker 4>because those guys will fight all the </v>

1366
00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:43.950
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1367
00:55:43.950 --> 00:55:44.860
<v Speaker 4>He'll probably like two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>three times a week.</v>

1368
00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:46.690
<v Speaker 4>That's huge.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>

1369
00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:48.700
<v Speaker 4>he's my snowmobile and partner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1370

<v Speaker 4>pump.</v>

1372
00:55:53.701 --> 00:55:53.701
<v Speaker 4>So I don't know if you've ever ridden a </v>
<v Speaker 4>snowmobile,</v>

1373
00:55:53.701 --> 00:55:57.040
<v Speaker 4>but you get stuck in like five,</v>
<v Speaker 4>six feet of power and now you're stuck.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's good to have good friends.</v>

1381
00:56:13.311 --> 00:56:18.311

<v Speaker 4>Especially ones that can lift a fucking </v>

1384
00:56:24.010 --> 00:56:25.990
<v Speaker 3>it's even more frustrating when someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets.</v>

1385
00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:28.240
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're an accountant and they suspend</v>

1386
00:56:28.241 --> 00:56:29.470
<v Speaker 3>you for five years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1387
00:56:29.471 --> 00:56:34.471
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could always get a job doing </v>

1388
00:56:34.471 --> 00:56:35.791
<v Speaker 3>something else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then five years from now you get </v>

1389
00:56:35.791 --> 00:56:37.531
<v Speaker 3>reinstated as an accountant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when you're an athlete you got this </v>

1390
00:56:37.531 --> 00:56:37.531
<v Speaker 3>short window.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1391
00:56:37.531 --> 00:56:38.950
<v Speaker 3>I think nick started fight when he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>18,</v>

1392
00:56:39.730 --> 00:56:44.730
<v Speaker 3>so he's 32 now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got a few years left at Max.</v>

1393
00:56:44.850 --> 00:56:46.690
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Max Max.</v>

1394
00:56:48.170 --> 00:56:53.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's conceivable that he could </v>
<v Speaker 3>come back at 37 since he does take care </v>

1395
00:56:53.170 --> 00:56:57.031
<v Speaker 3>of his body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's maybe it's a very tough </v>

1396
00:56:57.031 --> 00:56:57.670
<v Speaker 3>financially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing right?</v>

1397
00:56:58.150 --> 00:57:00.250
<v Speaker 3>You're accustomed to a lifestyle in </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting.</v>

1398
00:57:00.310 --> 00:57:01.780
<v Speaker 3>I am at least.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1399
00:57:02.260 --> 00:57:04.480
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a super degenerative my money.</v>

1400
00:57:04.481 --> 00:57:05.990
<v Speaker 3>Everyone knows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not mean.</v>

1401
00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:08.650
<v Speaker 3>What if I were to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if something happened to me today,</v>

1402
00:57:08.860 --> 00:57:13.860
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what would do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would have to go on the road and </v>

1403
00:57:13.860 --> 00:57:15.901
<v Speaker 3>started doing seminars,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but euro because of your style and </v>

1404
00:57:15.901 --> 00:57:17.290
<v Speaker 3>because of Nick's style,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys are both really well loved.</v>

1405
00:57:17.410 --> 00:57:18.850
<v Speaker 3>Like if something like that happened </v>
<v Speaker 3>with you,</v>

1406
00:57:18.970 --> 00:57:21.910
<v Speaker 3>you could go do seminars and make a few </v>
<v Speaker 3>grand every week and maybe,</v>

1407
00:57:21.911 --> 00:57:23.580
<v Speaker 3>maybe not in Dublin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How not to go anywhere.</v>

1408
00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:29.480
<v Speaker 3>Thought you could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you and connor fought and duked it </v>

1409
00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:30.610
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had an epic contest,</v>

1410
00:57:30.611 --> 00:57:32.050
<v Speaker 3>then you could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1411
00:57:32.100 --> 00:57:37.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm just a big stick in the more.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you beat them a couple times </v>

1412
00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:40.650
<v Speaker 3>decisively,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'd have to beat them to where they </v>

1413
00:57:40.650 --> 00:57:40.650
<v Speaker 3>have to just give in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd have to say,</v>

1414
00:57:40.650 --> 00:57:40.650
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you had to beat them,</v>

1415
00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:44.620
<v Speaker 3>beat them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you're fucking cut down to 1:45,</v>

1416
00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:48.580
<v Speaker 3>you torture them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking connor example.</v>

1417
00:57:48.760 --> 00:57:50.320
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I appreciate the fuck out of.</v>

1418
00:57:50.321 --> 00:57:52.930
<v Speaker 3>Look at that guy's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's getting eyes on the sport.</v>

1419
00:57:53.500 --> 00:57:55.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he really pisses me up.</v>

1420
00:57:55.631 --> 00:57:57.760
<v Speaker 3>I feel like just tell him when he was in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fucking president,</v>

1421
00:57:57.761 --> 00:57:59.260
<v Speaker 3>but I wanted to rip him so bad.</v>

1422
00:57:59.290 --> 00:58:00.670
<v Speaker 3>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wanted to kill my own bag.</v>

1423
00:58:00.671 --> 00:58:02.830
<v Speaker 3>You know a car and you can blow me like </v>
<v Speaker 3>a cup of hot soup.</v>

1424
00:58:02.831 --> 00:58:05.500
<v Speaker 3>You son of a bitch but me like a cup of </v>
<v Speaker 3>hot soup.</v>

1425
00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:09.010
<v Speaker 3>You blow on a cup of hot soup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what it is?</v>

1426
00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:10.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1427
00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:13.430
<v Speaker 3>Don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if he just blows you like that,</v>

1428
00:58:14.110 --> 00:58:16.570
<v Speaker 3>that's why it's confusing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The vernacular is really odd.</v>

1429
00:58:16.840 --> 00:58:21.840
<v Speaker 3>Like blow jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't understand where that blow me </v>

1430
00:58:21.840 --> 00:58:24.190
<v Speaker 3>like a couple hot soup first time.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1435
00:58:36.401 --> 00:58:37.120
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

1436
00:58:37.330 --> 00:58:41.410
<v Speaker 3>if you get a fight with me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have made it to your wife honey.</v>

1437
00:58:41.530 --> 00:58:43.990

<v Speaker 3>Nick's antics inside the octagon fuck </v>

1445
00:59:01.141 --> 00:59:01.141
<v Speaker 3>would a lot of people's heads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1446
00:59:01.141 --> 00:59:04.630
<v Speaker 3>Like the first fight with Robbie lawler.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I remember there was a first time I</v>

1447
00:59:04.631 --> 00:59:06.570
<v Speaker 3>ever saw nick talk shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was the first fight with brock.</v>

1448
00:59:06.571 --> 00:59:08.110
<v Speaker 3>He logs Robbie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was dangerous.</v>

1449
00:59:08.260 --> 00:59:13.260
<v Speaker 3>So Nick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nick took that shit talking to def con </v>

1450
00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:15.580
<v Speaker 3>five and he got into the octagon and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>first thing he does,</v>

1451
00:59:15.581 --> 00:59:20.581
<v Speaker 3>he gets into the octagon.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He looks over at robby goes stockton </v>

1452
00:59:20.581 --> 00:59:22.490
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker stockton and he starts </v>
<v Speaker 3>walking around Stockton Mother and rob.</v>

1453
00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:24.250
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck is he talking about?</v>

1454
00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:25.040
<v Speaker 3>That even mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1455
00:59:25.170 --> 00:59:28.790
<v Speaker 3>Then the entire time the fight is going </v>
<v Speaker 3>on like,</v>

1456
00:59:28.791 --> 00:59:29.120
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1457
00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:30.530
<v Speaker 3>Bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you gonna do Bitch,</v>

1458
00:59:30.590 --> 00:59:32.330
<v Speaker 3>what you gonna do Bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it hit them all.</v>

1459
00:59:32.331 --> 00:59:33.560
<v Speaker 3>Bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just stung you bitch.</v>

1460
00:59:33.740 --> 00:59:38.740
<v Speaker 3>And it'd be popping them and every time </v>
<v Speaker 3>robby lawler didn't talk back to them </v>

1461
00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:41.300
<v Speaker 3>but you could clearly see he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he didn't anticipate that,</v>

1462
00:59:41.330 --> 00:59:43.970
<v Speaker 3>but I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As far as nick and nate go,</v>

1463
00:59:44.090 --> 00:59:49.030
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if that's like a game plan </v>
<v Speaker 3>that there that's just like them.</v>

1464
00:59:49.330 --> 00:59:51.100
<v Speaker 3>Like I think if they were on the street </v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd be like,</v>

1465
00:59:51.180 --> 00:59:56.180
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's like real life talk like </v>

1466
00:59:56.180 --> 00:59:56.180
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what they know.</v>

1467
00:59:56.180 --> 00:59:57.340
<v Speaker 3>But it's still a bit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1468
00:59:57.410 --> 00:59:58.400
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's them,</v>

1469
00:59:58.460 --> 01:00:03.460
<v Speaker 3>that's them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying is still a </v>

1470
01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:04.160
<v Speaker 3>psychological think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an excellent tactic.</v>

1471
01:00:04.190 --> 01:00:05.690
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and do you think silver?</v>

1472
01:00:05.740 --> 01:00:09.020
<v Speaker 3>It fucked Anderson Silva's head up dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody laid out on the mat.</v>

1473
01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:09.970
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He laid down,</v>

1474
01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:16.700
<v Speaker 3>got a and get a nap in the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 3>pound for pound fighter in the history </v>

1475
01:00:18.351 --> 01:00:23.351
<v Speaker 3>of the sport and he lays down and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>he gets up with his hands out like what </v>

1476
01:00:23.351 --> 01:00:23.351
<v Speaker 3>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what pitched fucking.</v>

1477
01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:26.060
<v Speaker 3>And he didn't do any of that leading up </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the fight,</v>

1478
01:00:26.061 --> 01:00:29.840
<v Speaker 3>which was even more fucked up because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't think Anderson expected it at all.</v>

1479
01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:32.090
<v Speaker 3>And then when he was in there talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit to him,</v>

1480
01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:37.010
<v Speaker 3>you could see Anderson just like moving </v>
<v Speaker 3>around and not doing anything frozen.</v>

1481
01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:38.480
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking about like,</v>

1482
01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:43.490
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bitch and Anderson had never experienced</v>

1483
01:00:43.491 --> 01:00:44.660
<v Speaker 3>that before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man,</v>

1484
01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:50.100
<v Speaker 3>come did he is Anderson is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the greatest psychological fall I've </v>

1485
01:00:51.110 --> 01:00:56.110
<v Speaker 3>ever seen in my career to witness him go</v>
<v Speaker 3>from the guy who beat Stephan Bonner who</v>

1486
01:00:57.231 --> 01:00:59.630
<v Speaker 3>steps his back up against the cage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drops his hands,</v>

1487
01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:00.170
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>

1488
01:01:00.270 --> 01:01:02.870
<v Speaker 3>go ahead and then moves out of the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then decides,</v>

1489
01:01:02.871 --> 01:01:03.950
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now I'm gonna attack,</v>

1490
01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:05.570
<v Speaker 3>hits bonded with the need of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>stomach,</v>

1491
01:01:05.571 --> 01:01:07.870
<v Speaker 3>drops out and then pound them out and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Tkos.</v>

1492
01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:12.900
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it looks like a guy in the </v>

1493
01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:12.900
<v Speaker 3>fucking matrix.</v>

1494
01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:15.850
<v Speaker 3>I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then to go from that confidence to </v>

1495
01:01:15.850 --> 01:01:16.130
<v Speaker 3>the two Weidman fights,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1496
01:01:16.131 --> 01:01:21.131
<v Speaker 3>they did a number on him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did a number on him like I'd never </v>

1497
01:01:21.131 --> 01:01:21.131
<v Speaker 3>seen before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1498
01:01:21.131 --> 01:01:25.810
<v Speaker 3>it's fascinating to see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fascinating to see how a guy could </v>

1499
01:01:25.810 --> 01:01:27.650
<v Speaker 3>be almost just unbeatable.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then Weidman,</v>

1500
01:01:27.651 --> 01:01:28.490
<v Speaker 3>after the second fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1501
01:01:28.491 --> 01:01:31.040
<v Speaker 3>you gotta think about the second fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anderson broke his leg,</v>

1502
01:01:31.070 --> 01:01:31.820
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure did.</v>

1503
01:01:31.821 --> 01:01:34.860
<v Speaker 3>Well Weidman didn't knock him out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He broke his leg and he had him hurt bad</v>

1504
01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:36.740
<v Speaker 3>first round.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then after that fight,</v>

1505
01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:38.180
<v Speaker 3>Wyden was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

1506
01:01:38.210 --> 01:01:39.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to find them again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to hurt him.</v>

1507
01:01:40.790 --> 01:01:41.430
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

1508
01:01:43.020 --> 01:01:45.320
<v Speaker 3>just for Anderson to hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's got to be like,</v>

1509
01:01:45.350 --> 01:01:47.930
<v Speaker 3>that's a mind fuck man playing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean you're coming up.</v>

1510
01:01:48.050 --> 01:01:53.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean the mind is such a motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you could just get your mind to </v>

1511
01:01:54.051 --> 01:01:56.480
<v Speaker 3>do what your heart wants to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>life will be so much easier.</v>

1512
01:01:57.100 --> 01:01:59.390
<v Speaker 3>I think there are so many times I'm in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the cage.</v>

1513
01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:07.900
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know if my brain knew what </v>

1514
01:02:07.900 --> 01:02:09.200
<v Speaker 3>my heart was trying to say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's what I wanted to do.</v>

1515
01:02:09.201 --> 01:02:13.640
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's so and then you fuck bro.</v>

1516
01:02:13.641 --> 01:02:15.200
<v Speaker 3>I can't even put words on it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1517
01:02:15.201 --> 01:02:17.420
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you do any mental training?</v>

1518
01:02:17.421 --> 01:02:20.030
<v Speaker 3>Do you do any meditating or any </v>
<v Speaker 3>visualization?</v>

1519
01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:22.470
<v Speaker 4>Fucking ice cold budweiser rather than </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about,</v>

1520
01:02:23.370 --> 01:02:25.830
<v Speaker 4>God dammit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking fight is a fight.</v>

1521
01:02:25.831 --> 01:02:27.390
<v Speaker 4>But I probably maybe should.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1522
01:02:27.930 --> 01:02:30.300
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's in this sport.</v>

1523
01:02:30.301 --> 01:02:30.880
<v Speaker 4>It's not like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Gotcha.</v>

1524
01:02:30.930 --> 01:02:31.980
<v Speaker 4>I was telling him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Blake Griffin Day like,</v>

1525
01:02:31.981 --> 01:02:34.320
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have a bad day.</v>

1526
01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:36.290
<v Speaker 4>You fall back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let your team pick up slack.</v>

1527
01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:39.030
<v Speaker 4>If I have a bad day on the worst fighter</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the world,</v>

1528
01:02:39.031 --> 01:02:42.990
<v Speaker 4>my twitter feed is just nothing but you </v>
<v Speaker 4>pussy fucking die.</v>

1529
01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:48.380
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a difference between a guy </v>

1530
01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:48.380
<v Speaker 4>losing a basketball game two and getting</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit on by fans.</v>

1531
01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:49.740
<v Speaker 4>All you have to stay offline for a </v>
<v Speaker 4>couple of days.</v>

1532
01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:55.060
<v Speaker 4>You know when you hit that three pointer</v>
<v Speaker 4>to win the game and you're a fucking </v>

1533
01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:55.060
<v Speaker 4>hero again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>back to your backup.</v>

1534
01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:59.780
<v Speaker 4>But for a fighter man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially because fighting like when a </v>

1535
01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:02.760
<v Speaker 4>kid or especially an idiot looks at a </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighter,</v>

1536
01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:05.730
<v Speaker 4>they look at something that is so </v>
<v Speaker 4>unattainable,</v>

1537
01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:07.800
<v Speaker 4>they might as well be talking to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>Unicorn,</v>

1538
01:03:07.970 --> 01:03:12.970
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they might as well have been talking to </v>

1539
01:03:12.970 --> 01:03:12.970
<v Speaker 4>a god.</v>

1540
01:03:12.970 --> 01:03:15.380
<v Speaker 4>They might as well be talking to someone</v>
<v Speaker 4>who's not even real so they feel like </v>

1541
01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:18.860
<v Speaker 4>they can talk shit to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you say God and something real like </v>

1542
01:03:19.150 --> 01:03:21.120
<v Speaker 4>you're not even say since I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1543
01:03:21.690 --> 01:03:23.380
<v Speaker 4>that's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know like your,</v>

1544
01:03:23.390 --> 01:03:26.700
<v Speaker 4>your Apollo and Zeus or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1545
01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:29.360
<v Speaker 4>Because like you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1546
01:03:29.370 --> 01:03:31.560
<v Speaker 4>you are not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't relate to you.</v>

1547
01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:33.570
<v Speaker 4>And when the rightness thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're sitting there,</v>

1548
01:03:33.571 --> 01:03:35.430
<v Speaker 4>they're fucking keyboard getting crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1549
01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:37.620
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I just did was I think I might have</v>

1550
01:03:37.621 --> 01:03:42.621
<v Speaker 4>deleted something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean the crazy thing about fighting is</v>

1551
01:03:43.470 --> 01:03:45.420
<v Speaker 4>if you and I were to go out and fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>right now,</v>

1552
01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:47.340
<v Speaker 4>there's no emotion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no thought.</v>

1553
01:03:47.341 --> 01:03:49.980
<v Speaker 4>It's just fucking get it right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But now December 18th,</v>

<v Speaker 4>problem.</v>

1555
01:03:53.250 --> 01:03:55.050
<v Speaker 4>It's not the fight that bothers me.</v>

1556
01:03:55.350 --> 01:03:58.290
<v Speaker 4>Nothing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I think I speak for all fighters.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I feel the mental game is so hard to </v>

1613
01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:57.121
<v Speaker 4>grasp because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Henry Smith and Jafari or calling out </v>

1614
01:05:57.121 --> 01:05:57.240
<v Speaker 4>what I should do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1615
01:05:57.310 --> 01:05:59.000
<v Speaker 4>I see what I should do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1616
01:05:59.050 --> 01:06:01.420
<v Speaker 4>If I don't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just like frozen,</v>

1617
01:06:01.810 --> 01:06:05.860
<v Speaker 4>like a stick in the mud.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But do you think that like,</v>

1618
01:06:06.270 --> 01:06:07.260
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when you,</v>

1619
01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:08.740
<v Speaker 4>when you're in the heart of battle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1620
01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:10.900
<v Speaker 4>Let me ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you're at your best,</v>

1621
01:06:10.930 --> 01:06:14.260
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like let's say a particularly impressive</v>

1622
01:06:14.261 --> 01:06:16.360
<v Speaker 4>fight like the Jim Miller,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jim Miller fight,</v>

1623
01:06:16.361 --> 01:06:18.370
<v Speaker 4>you were on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just look,</v>

1624
01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:22.030
<v Speaker 4>you look so dominant in that fight and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you look so focused and you just,</v>

1625
01:06:22.150 --> 01:06:24.100
<v Speaker 4>your combinations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're distancing.</v>

1626
01:06:24.101 --> 01:06:26.470
<v Speaker 4>Everything was on point when you're in </v>
<v Speaker 4>that zone,</v>

1627
01:06:26.471 --> 01:06:31.471
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you like right before you stopped </v>

1628
01:06:31.471 --> 01:06:31.471
<v Speaker 4>him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>

1629
01:06:31.471 --> 01:06:32.170
<v Speaker 4>what is in your mind?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you empty or you blank?</v>

1630
01:06:33.150 --> 01:06:35.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to be a fucking thousand </v>
<v Speaker 4>percent honest with you.</v>

1631
01:06:35.470 --> 01:06:40.470
<v Speaker 4>I'm like a video game in a third person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I see myself from behind my head </v>

1632
01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:48.360
<v Speaker 4>playing myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'll fucking moon and taking my brain </v>

1633
01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:49.600
<v Speaker 4>talking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's how I see the fights.</v>

1634
01:06:50.010 --> 01:06:55.010
<v Speaker 4>I don't see the fight in me finding use </v>
<v Speaker 4>from like a helicopter view above my </v>

1635
01:06:55.010 --> 01:06:58.780
<v Speaker 4>fucking right shoulder and I see it like</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I'm in the zone and I'm so,</v>

1636
01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:01.270
<v Speaker 4>you know what I'm talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>emotional step back.</v>

1637
01:07:01.271 --> 01:07:03.590
<v Speaker 4>And I'd like do this like little hop </v>
<v Speaker 4>hopping that like puts me like.</v>

1638
01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:07.420
<v Speaker 4>Then I like go behind fucking dialed in </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's like deep,</v>

1639
01:07:07.421 --> 01:07:08.810
<v Speaker 4>deep,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything just flows right.</v>

1640
01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:13.880
<v Speaker 4>And I see myself out of body is crazy as</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck.</v>

1641
01:07:13.930 --> 01:07:17.500
<v Speaker 4>Sounds right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>From like a third party.</v>

1642
01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:20.890
<v Speaker 4>Well I haven't heard it before from </v>
<v Speaker 4>anybody else,</v>

1643
01:07:20.891 --> 01:07:25.891
<v Speaker 4>but it doesn't sound crazy because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think what you're talking about is it's </v>

1644
01:07:25.891 --> 01:07:27.440
<v Speaker 4>not you like your outside of you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I am.</v>

1645
01:07:27.630 --> 01:07:32.630
<v Speaker 4>I'm literally outside of me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I'm telling that person what </v>

1646
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:37.300
<v Speaker 4>to do from an outside perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you're at your best like that,</v>

1647
01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:38.850
<v Speaker 4>would you say you've done them?</v>

1648
01:07:38.860 --> 01:07:42.880
<v Speaker 4>Fight the entire fight the entire from </v>
<v Speaker 4>bell to bell.</v>

1649
01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:45.490
<v Speaker 4>The Donald fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was outside.</v>

1650
01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:47.980
<v Speaker 4>I mean there wasn't a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there wasn't a point we touched.</v>

1651
01:07:48.010 --> 01:07:53.010
<v Speaker 4>I remember clear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll seeing myself run across and </v>

1652
01:07:53.010 --> 01:07:56.521
<v Speaker 4>touch gloves and he was fucking on dee.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was the fight before the Dunham </v>

1653
01:07:56.521 --> 01:07:56.521
<v Speaker 4>fight?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dos Anjos.</v>

1654
01:07:56.800 --> 01:07:59.830
<v Speaker 4>So do you think that because of the dos </v>
<v Speaker 4>Anjos loss,</v>

1655
01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:02.350
<v Speaker 4>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got more focused,</v>

1656
01:08:02.351 --> 01:08:05.740
<v Speaker 4>more intense and then came out in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Dunham fight and you were just on fire.</v>

1657
01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:07.270
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish I had an answer for that.</v>

1658
01:08:07.271 --> 01:08:08.400
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1659
01:08:08.410 --> 01:08:11.190
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I totally underestimated the dust dust.</v>

1660
01:08:11.290 --> 01:08:13.060
<v Speaker 4>Sondra.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sondra stocking will not happen again.</v>

1661
01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:15.130
<v Speaker 4>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's gotten a lot better.</v>

1662
01:08:15.330 --> 01:08:15.980
<v Speaker 4>Know that guy works</v>

1663
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:17.350
<v Speaker 3>hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

1664
01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:22.360
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's your adversary and you're fighting </v>

1665
01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:23.060
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you're at your best,</v>

1666
01:08:23.061 --> 01:08:25.450
<v Speaker 3>would you say that you don't have any </v>
<v Speaker 3>emotions at all?</v>

1667
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:26.670
<v Speaker 3>Zero,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1668
01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:27.530
<v Speaker 3>Zero at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>

1669
01:08:27.650 --> 01:08:28.520
<v Speaker 3>at zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1670
01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:31.820
<v Speaker 3>And then when you're frustrated and </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in a bad place,</v>

1671
01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.070
<v Speaker 3>you're battling your emotions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trying to calm them down.</v>

1672
01:08:34.470 --> 01:08:35.870
<v Speaker 3>Try and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1673
01:08:35.871 --> 01:08:38.420
<v Speaker 3>It's like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like trying to find second gear.</v>

1674
01:08:39.390 --> 01:08:41.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1675
01:08:41.370 --> 01:08:43.250
<v Speaker 3>it's like the worst sound in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

1676
01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:46.570
<v Speaker 3>That's what it fucking feels like when </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>

1677
01:08:46.571 --> 01:08:48.620
<v Speaker 3>I try to grinding,</v>
<v Speaker 3>grinding,</v>

1678
01:08:48.621 --> 01:08:52.280
<v Speaker 3>grinding like cold motherfucker that's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he talked to yourself,</v>

1679
01:08:53.660 --> 01:08:57.320
<v Speaker 3>you fucking pussy goal and that's what's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going through my mind.</v>

1680
01:08:57.321 --> 01:08:58.510
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fat,</v>

1681
01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:00.560
<v Speaker 3>can't find it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just can't find second gear.</v>

1682
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:05.950
<v Speaker 3>And it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're in that place is the most </v>

1683
01:09:05.950 --> 01:09:06.500
<v Speaker 3>frustrating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The absolute most frustrating man.</v>

1684
01:09:06.501 --> 01:09:09.010
<v Speaker 3>There's nothing that means like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do,</v>

1685
01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:09.740
<v Speaker 3>what do you do?</v>

1686
01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:15.040
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you think that it's possible that </v>

1687
01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:16.400
<v Speaker 3>through mental training and through </v>
<v Speaker 3>specific techniques you could get better</v>

1688
01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:21.580
<v Speaker 3>at achieving that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you would call maybe like a flow </v>

1689
01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:23.630
<v Speaker 3>state the same way you got better at </v>
<v Speaker 3>being a fighter?</v>

1690
01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:26.630
<v Speaker 3>Like think about your first days of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fighting when you first learned Moitai,</v>

1691
01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:28.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you weren't like,</v>

1692
01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:32.360
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you when I first saw you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw you when you on the tap out show.</v>

1693
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:33.800
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it was like,</v>

1694
01:09:33.890 --> 01:09:37.970
<v Speaker 3>who is this wild motherfucker hanging </v>
<v Speaker 3>out with masks and throwing head kicks.</v>

1695
01:09:38.090 --> 01:09:41.270
<v Speaker 3>But the cool thing about you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what I felt you um,</v>

1696
01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:43.760
<v Speaker 3>you sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were a pr,</v>

1697
01:09:43.790 --> 01:09:47.660
<v Speaker 3>the personification of an idea that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Eddie Bravo and I both had.</v>

1698
01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:52.960
<v Speaker 3>And that idea was if you get a guy who's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a really good kickboxer but also has a </v>

1699
01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:57.881
<v Speaker 3>really good guard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their fucking super dangerous because </v>

1700
01:09:57.881 --> 01:10:00.410
<v Speaker 3>they're not worried about getting taken </v>
<v Speaker 3>down so they throw those kicks freely.</v>

1701
01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:03.110
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of your early fights by submission</v>

1702
01:10:03.111 --> 01:10:04.100
<v Speaker 3>off your back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Correct?</v>

1703
01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:05.750
<v Speaker 3>Because yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've just,</v>

1704
01:10:06.070 --> 01:10:08.170
<v Speaker 3>well for one of my wrestling was zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1705
01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:09.620
<v Speaker 3>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not like I was like,</v>

1706
01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:12.130
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's kicked freely and defend.</v>

1707
01:10:12.310 --> 01:10:13.250
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they just take me down.</v>

1708
01:10:13.251 --> 01:10:14.270
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fun.</v>

1709
01:10:14.271 --> 01:10:16.510
<v Speaker 3>As you were to watch back then when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>first watched you,</v>

1710
01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:18.680
<v Speaker 3>are you telling me now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that what's going on here?</v>

1711
01:10:18.710 --> 01:10:18.900
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1712
01:10:18.901 --> 01:10:20.420
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a lot better now,</v>

1713
01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:21.290
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1714
01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:24.530
<v Speaker 3>You're a lot better now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you got better at that.</v>

1715
01:10:24.890 --> 01:10:29.890
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that you could get better </v>
<v Speaker 3>the same way with your mind float and </v>

1716
01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:32.420
<v Speaker 3>don't you think that you should practice</v>
<v Speaker 3>that though?</v>

1717
01:10:32.570 --> 01:10:34.020
<v Speaker 3>I should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I should.</v>

1718
01:10:34.370 --> 01:10:36.440
<v Speaker 3>I want to work on that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to work on that.</v>

1719
01:10:36.441 --> 01:10:41.150
<v Speaker 3>I think if you had a coach that could </v>
<v Speaker 3>work through about this mind.</v>

1720
01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:46.630
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's been times when I've been </v>

1721
01:10:46.630 --> 01:10:50.050
<v Speaker 3>hitting pads and I fucking go into flow </v>
<v Speaker 3>state.</v>

1722
01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:53.580
<v Speaker 3>You're in the zone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go into it fucking blah blah,</v>

1723
01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:54.970
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen you do it.</v>

1724
01:10:54.971 --> 01:10:58.490
<v Speaker 3>I've seen videos of you doing two days </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago by and I don't see it.</v>

1725
01:10:58.910 --> 01:11:00.860
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how it goes though,</v>

1726
01:11:00.861 --> 01:11:01.940
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then sometimes it's like,</v>

1727
01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:03.830
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is like,</v>

1728
01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:07.550
<v Speaker 3>it's like a drug man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that state exists in everything.</v>

1729
01:11:07.551 --> 01:11:11.690
<v Speaker 3>I think singers experience it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think also to basketball players,</v>

1730
01:11:11.691 --> 01:11:14.760
<v Speaker 3>all sorts of different athletes </v>
<v Speaker 3>experience that state and it's all about</v>

1731
01:11:14.761 --> 01:11:19.761
<v Speaker 3>trying to find that state that state </v>
<v Speaker 3>exists in standup comedy that state </v>

1732
01:11:19.761 --> 01:11:20.550
<v Speaker 3>exists in and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think in every,</v>

1733
01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:25.640
<v Speaker 3>every thing that's difficult to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a time we use zone into his own </v>

1734
01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:27.210
<v Speaker 3>hand man or zone out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1735
01:11:27.211 --> 01:11:28.470
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is,</v>

1736
01:11:28.471 --> 01:11:33.471
<v Speaker 3>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it only comes if you've dotted all your </v>

1737
01:11:33.471 --> 01:11:35.220
<v Speaker 3>i's and crossed all your t's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to have no worries at all about</v>

1738
01:11:35.221 --> 01:11:36.350
<v Speaker 3>your preparation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh No,</v>

1739
01:11:36.351 --> 01:11:36.580
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1740
01:11:37.980 --> 01:11:39.870
<v Speaker 3>That all has to be absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1741
01:11:39.871 --> 01:11:44.871
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think the drinking has any effect </v>

1742
01:11:45.511 --> 01:11:47.530
<v Speaker 3>on your physical performance or do you </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that you,</v>

1743
01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:52.760
<v Speaker 3>you do it at a level where you're not </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking with your endurance thing?</v>

1744
01:11:53.041 --> 01:11:58.041

<v Speaker 3>So I mean,</v>

1935
01:18:51.490 --> 01:18:52.400
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess I don't,</v>

1936
01:18:52.401 --> 01:18:55.460
<v Speaker 3>I don't smoke weed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I've done it of course.</v>

1937
01:18:55.461 --> 01:19:00.461
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did a backpacking trip with a couple </v>

1938
01:19:00.461 --> 01:19:00.461
<v Speaker 3>of buddies of mine and they brought </v>
<v Speaker 3>weeds.</v>

1939
01:19:00.461 --> 01:19:01.470
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course I smoked it,</v>

1940
01:19:01.471 --> 01:19:02.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>packing,</v>

1941
01:19:02.330 --> 01:19:07.330
<v Speaker 3>we'd go hand to hand and I was in charge</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the hands and I was in charge of the </v>

1942
01:19:07.330 --> 01:19:08.720
<v Speaker 3>GPS.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So where we're going,</v>

1943
01:19:08.721 --> 01:19:13.721
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was two miles as the crow flies </v>

1944
01:19:13.721 --> 01:19:13.721
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>every fucking time they asked me where I</v>

1945
01:19:13.721 --> 01:19:13.721
<v Speaker 3>was gone because we kept moving.</v>

1946
01:19:13.721 --> 01:19:15.260
<v Speaker 3>But the spot we're going to stay the </v>
<v Speaker 3>same.</v>

1947
01:19:15.290 --> 01:19:19.820
<v Speaker 3>So everywhere we went it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's two miles as the crow flies.</v>

1948
01:19:19.821 --> 01:19:23.240
<v Speaker 3>So miles as the crow flies is such a </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking mountain turn.</v>

1949
01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:28.540
<v Speaker 3>People who have never hiked,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea what you're talking </v>

1950
01:19:28.540 --> 01:19:28.540
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1951
01:19:28.540 --> 01:19:30.770
<v Speaker 3>But that's the idea folks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that if you go down and then up will,</v>

1952
01:19:30.771 --> 01:19:35.771
<v Speaker 3>the distance between those points </v>
<v Speaker 3>straight as a crow would fly is like a </v>

1953
01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:38.090
<v Speaker 3>mile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're going like a mile and a half,</v>

1954
01:19:38.091 --> 01:19:43.091
<v Speaker 3>two miles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe three if you were still fucking </v>

1955

<v Speaker 3>sport.</v>

2006
01:21:43.020 --> 01:21:45.310
<v Speaker 3>So dos Anjos is a beast.</v>

<v Speaker 3>good time and everything like that.</v>

2011
01:21:54.901 --> 01:21:57.480
<v Speaker 3>This is something he's been working </v>
<v Speaker 3>towards for a long,</v>

2012
01:21:57.481 --> 01:22:00.780
<v Speaker 3>long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like while he's peeing,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I could just tell you this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is how this guy is all the time.</v>

2014
01:22:03.241 --> 01:22:06.060
<v Speaker 3>Like he's not putting on a show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a great guy too.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's always like,</v>

2017
01:22:10.441 --> 01:22:12.150
<v Speaker 3>when you hear about him getting in </v>
<v Speaker 3>fights with people,</v>

2018
01:22:12.270 --> 01:22:14.340
<v Speaker 3>like the fact that he barely net kicked </v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy.</v>

2019
01:22:14.610 --> 01:22:16.260
<v Speaker 3>If a lot of people said that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>him,</v>

2022

<v Speaker 3>Bravo or sheffield staring at me.</v>

<v Speaker 3>fear.</v>

2024
01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:33.960
<v Speaker 3>That's my buddy Mike Maxwell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but made a bunch of a fear.</v>

2025
01:22:33.970 --> 01:22:35.490
<v Speaker 3>Sheffield,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sheffield,</v>

2026
01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:37.770
<v Speaker 3>my girlfriend and my girlfriend's last </v>
<v Speaker 3>name Sheffield.</v>

2027
01:22:37.771 --> 01:22:38.880
<v Speaker 3>So that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2028
01:22:38.881 --> 01:22:40.370
<v Speaker 3>that's very different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think about art,</v>

2029
01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:42.570
<v Speaker 3>you think about your girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things got weird,</v>

2030
01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:47.130
<v Speaker 3>that kind of super fucking weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend Mike made a bunch of different</v>

2031
01:22:47.131 --> 01:22:50.130
<v Speaker 3>pictures of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what Joey back there.</v>

2032
01:22:50.131 --> 01:22:54.510
<v Speaker 3>We've got to revise the Joey Joey Diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wondering now which one was he?</v>

2033
01:22:55.240 --> 01:22:57.480
<v Speaker 3>That's in the back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It didn't work out.</v>

2034
01:22:57.810 --> 01:23:00.510
<v Speaker 3>These are reduced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I just bought some new guns.</v>

2035
01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:01.650
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw a man.</v>

2036
01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:04.290
<v Speaker 3>So what is an integrity suppressed 300 </v>
<v Speaker 3>win mag.</v>

2037
01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:06.010
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then that's where</v>

2038
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:11.010
<v Speaker 4>the suppressor is part of the barrel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The suppressor for people that don't </v>

2039
01:23:11.010 --> 01:23:11.650
<v Speaker 4>know guns as a silencer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it makes it really quiet.</v>

2040
01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:16.450
<v Speaker 4>Sounds like a faggot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And really all you hear is nothing.</v>

2041
01:23:18.540 --> 01:23:19.870
<v Speaker 4>So you have a $300,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2042
01:23:19.871 --> 01:23:22.690
<v Speaker 4>So it's a motherfucker of a gun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So much kick.</v>

2043
01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:27.780
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so this has very little kick to because </v>

2044
01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:29.881
<v Speaker 4>it's zero kick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So normally if you're gay people they </v>

2045
01:23:29.881 --> 01:23:30.400
<v Speaker 4>shoot and the double tap,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2046
01:23:30.730 --> 01:23:33.890
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you can do whatever you want.</v>

2047
01:23:33.891 --> 01:23:35.590
<v Speaker 4>And that's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Insane.</v>

2048
01:23:36.250 --> 01:23:38.320
<v Speaker 4>So we're super,</v>
<v Speaker 4>super sonic rounds,</v>

2049
01:23:38.321 --> 01:23:39.010
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which is,</v>

2050
01:23:39.100 --> 01:23:41.500
<v Speaker 4>it breaks the sound barrier that's in </v>
<v Speaker 4>California,</v>

2051
01:23:41.501 --> 01:23:42.310
<v Speaker 4>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>This gun?</v>

2052
01:23:42.430 --> 01:23:43.440
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>

2053
01:23:43.441 --> 01:23:44.980
<v Speaker 4>everything is legal in California.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have no idea,</v>

2054
01:23:45.490 --> 01:23:49.720
<v Speaker 4>but.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they make sub subsonic ammo again.</v>

2055
01:23:49.721 --> 01:23:51.030
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you don't hear it right?</v>

2056
01:23:51.070 --> 01:23:56.070
<v Speaker 4>But we're shooting supersonic animal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just to prove a point why all you could </v>

2057
01:23:56.070 --> 01:23:56.070
<v Speaker 4>hear is the bulk.</v>

2058
01:23:56.070 --> 01:23:56.470
<v Speaker 4>Clinique,</v>
<v Speaker 4>clinique,</v>

2059
01:23:56.590 --> 01:24:00.790
<v Speaker 4>clinique insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the guy that came out to my house,</v>

2060
01:24:00.791 --> 01:24:03.400
<v Speaker 4>it's a keystone armory plugging them </v>
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>

2061
01:24:03.401 --> 01:24:04.840
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll please do.</v>

2062
01:24:06.040 --> 01:24:09.880
<v Speaker 4>They would spit down the barrel because </v>
<v Speaker 4>suppressors aren't made a gun.</v>

2063
01:24:09.881 --> 01:24:11.050
<v Speaker 4>How many rounds is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whole?</v>

2064
01:24:11.051 --> 01:24:13.540
<v Speaker 4>Thirty two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My 300 wind bangs,</v>

2065
01:24:13.541 --> 01:24:15.040
<v Speaker 4>Banjo Bolt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Action Rifles.</v>

2066
01:24:15.770 --> 01:24:17.260
<v Speaker 4>The same one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2067
01:24:17.261 --> 01:24:22.261
<v Speaker 4>So I'm going to leave it is an,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were literally shooting it in my </v>

2068
01:24:22.261 --> 01:24:24.610
<v Speaker 4>backyard and the guys across the street,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we call them over.</v>

2069
01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:25.120
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

2070
01:24:25.121 --> 01:24:28.360
<v Speaker 4>we thought you guys were just using your</v>
<v Speaker 4>nail guns shooting built in house.</v>

2071
01:24:28.420 --> 01:24:29.710
<v Speaker 4>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like clink clink,</v>

2072
01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:32.590
<v Speaker 4>clink cookie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they have nine millimeter,</v>

2073
01:24:32.650 --> 01:24:34.310
<v Speaker 4>45.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

2074
01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:38.050
<v Speaker 4>it sounds like a Pelican.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't even,</v>

2075
01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:40.180
<v Speaker 4>probably can't even possess them in </v>
<v Speaker 4>California,</v>

2076
01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:41.650
<v Speaker 4>which is really weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2077
01:24:41.830 --> 01:24:44.800
<v Speaker 4>in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hunting without a silencer is rude.</v>

2078
01:24:45.730 --> 01:24:49.210
<v Speaker 4>Like they all have suppressors because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't want to hurt people's ears.</v>

2079
01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:54.240
<v Speaker 4>Like they don't like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't make sense that you can hunt </v>

2080
01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:55.810
<v Speaker 4>with an archery equipment archery setup,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is totally silent.</v>

2081
01:24:55.860 --> 01:24:58.330
<v Speaker 4>It's that bad as Talladega short of </v>
<v Speaker 4>having ever been in Talladega.</v>

2082
01:24:58.360 --> 01:25:00.730
<v Speaker 4>Never been telling me about Talladega.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So fun.</v>

2083
01:25:01.360 --> 01:25:04.930
<v Speaker 4>Talladega and Daytona.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you guys are Nascar fans or if you're</v>

2084
01:25:04.931 --> 01:25:06.490
<v Speaker 4>not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you need to go.</v>

2085
01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:10.150
<v Speaker 4>Just experience the infield.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't want to really like watching.</v>

2086
01:25:10.151 --> 01:25:12.420
<v Speaker 4>I like watching,</v>
<v Speaker 4>turning left and then right.</v>

2087
01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:15.640
<v Speaker 4>I like a lot of movement in my racing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like that formula.</v>

2088
01:25:15.641 --> 01:25:17.760
<v Speaker 4>One thing was around a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>

2089
01:25:17.790 --> 01:25:21.430
<v Speaker 4>Kevin Harvick is a dear friend of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>number four all day.</v>

2090
01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:26.700
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they have this left turners on the </v>

2091
01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:29.440
<v Speaker 4>planet forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody left her as we're going here.</v>

2092
01:25:29.441 --> 01:25:31.930
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2132
01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:10.180
<v Speaker 3>question.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I tried to suppress it,</v>

2133
01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:14.600
<v Speaker 3>but part of being a commentator is like </v>

<v Speaker 3>don't think about that.</v>

2139
01:27:25.701 --> 01:27:26.210
<v Speaker 3>When I'm think about.</v>

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2146
01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:39.980
<v Speaker 3>She loves you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she,</v>

2147
01:27:40.010 --> 01:27:45.010
<v Speaker 3>she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she just likes to be no silence and it's</v>

2148
01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:46.580
<v Speaker 3>integrity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

2149
01:27:46.650 --> 01:27:48.740
<v Speaker 3>She should,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that they should offer that and</v>

2150
01:27:48.741 --> 01:27:49.350
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2151
01:27:49.370 --> 01:27:54.370
<v Speaker 3>Joe are to the fans can weigh the scale.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

2152
01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:59.640
<v Speaker 3>I know that it's important for me to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to be as objective about,</v>

2153
01:28:00.510 --> 01:28:05.510
<v Speaker 3>but I also have to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if something's happening and some guys </v>

2154
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:09.460
<v Speaker 3>that you see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes the judges don't agree with </v>

2155
01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:09.840
<v Speaker 3>the fans,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you will,</v>

2156
01:28:09.890 --> 01:28:10.510
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

<v Speaker 3>One side but big.</v>

2158
01:28:13.850 --> 01:28:18.350
<v Speaker 3>But I probably am better at it than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>judges.</v>

2159
01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:18.770
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

2160
01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:23.830
<v Speaker 3>There's a real problem and that's an </v>
<v Speaker 3>arrogant thing to say that they're </v>

2161
01:28:23.830 --> 01:28:24.420
<v Speaker 3>watch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't.</v>

01:34:27.461 --> 01:34:29.620
<v Speaker 3>If you had a rock on the end of a rope,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just swung it.</v>

2298
01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:34.270
<v Speaker 3>That's the way limit throws rock and </v>
<v Speaker 3>roll a rock on her rope.</v>

2299
01:34:34.720 --> 01:34:35.800
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2300
01:34:36.100 --> 01:34:37.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a great video.</v>

2301
01:34:37.900 --> 01:34:42.900
<v Speaker 3>We're a connor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Love him or hate him is a teaching when </v>

2302
01:34:42.900 --> 01:34:44.710
<v Speaker 3>he's coaching this this season of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ultimate fighter and they're doing these</v>

2303
01:34:44.711 --> 01:34:48.940
<v Speaker 3>real specific drills and he said a cool </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that I think John Kavanagh says.</v>

2304
01:34:49.150 --> 01:34:54.150
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is upgrading your software without </v>

2305
01:34:54.150 --> 01:34:56.350
<v Speaker 3>damaging your hardware.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's two schools of thought.</v>

2306
01:34:56.370 --> 01:34:56.780
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2307
01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 3>There's that school of thought,</v>

2308
01:34:57.980 --> 01:34:59.900
<v Speaker 4>like fight smart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>train smart,</v>

2309
01:35:00.140 --> 01:35:05.140
<v Speaker 4>and then there's the school of thought </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you hard ride jet skis over the </v>

2310
01:35:05.721 --> 01:35:08.120
<v Speaker 4>top of cliffs the day before you fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2311
01:35:08.121 --> 01:35:08.870
<v Speaker 4>we made.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>

2312
01:35:08.900 --> 01:35:12.020
<v Speaker 4>let's go fucking swim with sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2313
01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:13.760
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's your school thoughts,</v>

2314
01:35:13.830 --> 01:35:16.440
<v Speaker 4>sort of a different school of thought.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very much so.</v>

2315
01:35:16.441 --> 01:35:16.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2316
01:35:16.901 --> 01:35:21.901
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how hard training sessions are you </v>

2318
01:35:22.640 --> 01:35:23.510
<v Speaker 4>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

2319
01:35:23.511 --> 01:35:25.790
<v Speaker 4>I mean some days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some days,</v>

2320

<v Speaker 4>not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some days.</v>

2321
01:35:26.721 --> 01:35:27.530
<v Speaker 4>Not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I might,</v>

2322
01:35:27.650 --> 01:35:29.540
<v Speaker 4>I may wake up on Tuesday like I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 4>filling it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>just say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

2327
01:35:40.121 --> 01:35:42.080
<v Speaker 4>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people think that that actually</v>

2328
01:35:42.081 --> 01:35:44.380
<v Speaker 4>is a smart thing that that's active </v>
<v Speaker 4>recovery.</v>

2329
01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:49.460
<v Speaker 4>I'm tired,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll call it sold the day.</v>

2330
01:35:49.730 --> 01:35:51.950
<v Speaker 4>Do you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you like to still do things though?</v>

2331

<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah man.</v>

2333
01:35:56.980 --> 01:35:58.280
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>But if you think about that,</v>

2334
01:35:58.300 --> 01:36:00.860
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you're still working,</v>

2335
01:36:00.861 --> 01:36:02.660

01:38:13.111 --> 01:38:18.111
<v Speaker 3>a life worth living,</v>

2388
01:38:18.111 --> 01:38:19.410
<v Speaker 3>to write something appealing to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy's willing to not have sex.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I think that's what I searched for every</v>

2412
01:39:11.150 --> 01:39:11.940
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2413
01:39:11.941 --> 01:39:15.650
<v Speaker 3>like fighting is fucking love it and get</v>
<v Speaker 3>six times a year if I'm lucky.</v>

2414
01:39:15.651 --> 01:39:17.700
<v Speaker 3>And this year I'm good at one time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2415
01:39:17.701 --> 01:39:22.701
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's why I do the things I do </v>

2416
01:39:22.701 --> 01:39:24.090
<v Speaker 3>because it gives me that feeling that </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm searching for that scared.</v>

2417
01:39:24.330 --> 01:39:26.070
<v Speaker 3>What am I doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

2418
01:39:26.071 --> 01:39:29.160
<v Speaker 3>Feeling where you'd like proven yourself</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you'd like it to be true.</v>

2419
01:39:29.520 --> 01:39:31.680
<v Speaker 3>And those are two things that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>people shy away from.</v>

2420
01:39:31.730 --> 01:39:33.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>know competition.</v>

2421
01:39:33.481 --> 01:39:35.830
<v Speaker 3>If you can right now and said you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>better bowhunter me.</v>

2422
01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:38.060
<v Speaker 3>I bet we'll set the motherfucker </v>
<v Speaker 3>targeted.</v>

2423
01:39:38.070 --> 01:39:39.780
<v Speaker 3>Let's go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's do it.</v>

2424
01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:41.580
<v Speaker 3>And that's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean so.</v>

2425
01:39:41.730 --> 01:39:43.950
<v Speaker 3>Well that's also the only way you get </v>
<v Speaker 3>good at anything.</v>

2426
01:39:44.190 --> 01:39:49.190
<v Speaker 3>People shy away from that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just there's only one way you could </v>

2427
01:39:49.190 --> 01:39:52.440
<v Speaker 3>surround yourself with bad motherfuckers</v>
<v Speaker 3>are doing exactly what you do and you </v>

2428
01:39:52.440 --> 01:39:53.640
<v Speaker 3>force yourself to keep up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we inspire each other.</v>

2429
01:39:53.641 --> 01:39:58.641
<v Speaker 3>That is the problem in this sport </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I see that in the gym all the </v>

2430
01:39:58.641 --> 01:39:58.641
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see it,</v>

2431
01:39:58.641 --> 01:40:00.840
<v Speaker 3>the guys sparring day comes or grabbing </v>
<v Speaker 3>day comes.</v>

2432
01:40:00.841 --> 01:40:04.480
<v Speaker 3>You see all the guys finding the guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>they know they can be.</v>

2433
01:40:04.890 --> 01:40:06.590
<v Speaker 3>They don't go after the guy that kills </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2434
01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:09.120
<v Speaker 3>Me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want you motherfucker.</v>

2435
01:40:09.250 --> 01:40:11.880
<v Speaker 3>But I want to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want the toughest challenge.</v>

2436
01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:13.320
<v Speaker 3>You're the baddest dude you want.</v>

2437
01:40:13.320 --> 01:40:14.340
<v Speaker 3>Let's go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck me,</v>

2438
01:40:14.350 --> 01:40:16.410
<v Speaker 3>I want the one that's going to stir you </v>
<v Speaker 3>up inside.</v>

2439
01:40:16.740 --> 01:40:19.650
<v Speaker 3>Fucking burn me where you submit me </v>
<v Speaker 3>three times in five minutes.</v>

2440
01:40:19.770 --> 01:40:22.380
<v Speaker 3>Not going to happen again because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know what I mean?</v>

2441
01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:25.050
<v Speaker 3>That's how I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fucking fuck me.</v>

2442
01:40:25.890 --> 01:40:27.690
<v Speaker 3>I'm calling my coach like I just got </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up.</v>

2443
01:40:28.610 --> 01:40:29.820
<v Speaker 3>Let's fix this problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2444
01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:35.120
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that I want the guys that pushed </v>

2445
01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:35.120
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need those.</v>

2446
01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:35.120
<v Speaker 3>I need that in my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2447
01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:36.000
<v Speaker 3>when you get to the level that you're at</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

2448
01:40:36.001 --> 01:40:41.001
<v Speaker 3>you also realize that those guys that </v>
<v Speaker 3>push you or the reason why you put in </v>

2449
01:40:41.001 --> 01:40:44.340
<v Speaker 3>that extra effort that takes you to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>top of your ability and there's that.</v>

2450
01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:47.460
<v Speaker 3>There's this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a few guys that we all know that</v>

2451
01:40:47.461 --> 01:40:50.460
<v Speaker 3>never quite reached the top of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>ability.</v>

2452
01:40:50.461 --> 01:40:53.500
<v Speaker 3>Like you hear about them in the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're fucking on fire.</v>

2453
01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:54.970
<v Speaker 3>They just have the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2454
01:40:55.420 --> 01:41:00.420
<v Speaker 3>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have days where they world beaters </v>

2455
01:41:00.420 --> 01:41:03.210
<v Speaker 3>and for whatever reason they don't ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>get it together in the moment of crisis </v>

2456
01:41:03.210 --> 01:41:05.200
<v Speaker 3>is Jim Heroes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2457
01:41:05.380 --> 01:41:10.380
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the sport is an believable man.</v>

2458
01:41:10.661 --> 01:41:15.661
<v Speaker 3>It's like you have to be able to go out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there and fight at your best every </v>

2459
01:41:15.661 --> 01:41:17.050
<v Speaker 3>single day and you have to execute under</v>
<v Speaker 3>insane pressure.</v>

2460
01:41:17.080 --> 01:41:19.630
<v Speaker 3>That's the most admirable quality about </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2461
01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:24.830
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like sometimes when I look around like </v>

2462
01:41:24.830 --> 01:41:25.360
<v Speaker 3>that was one of the craziest things </v>
<v Speaker 3>about Rhonda fight was after she knocked</v>

2463
01:41:25.361 --> 01:41:30.361
<v Speaker 3>out bench go hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she just strutted around the cage and </v>

2464
01:41:30.361 --> 01:41:33.380
<v Speaker 3>looked up at.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody just took it all in stride.</v>

2465
01:41:33.410 --> 01:41:38.410
<v Speaker 3>It shifts face,</v>
<v Speaker 3>planted that chick on a straight out of </v>

2466
01:41:38.410 --> 01:41:38.410
<v Speaker 3>compton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Add.</v>

2467
01:41:38.410 --> 01:41:39.280
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean she really did.</v>

2468
01:41:39.310 --> 01:41:41.260
<v Speaker 3>Which the movie was fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>unbelievable.</v>

2469
01:41:41.261 --> 01:41:42.850
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You haven't seen the movie?</v>

2470
01:41:42.870 --> 01:41:43.540
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see them.</v>

2471
01:41:43.650 --> 01:41:44.830
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure it's great.</v>

2472
01:41:44.831 --> 01:41:49.831
<v Speaker 3>It's great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the fact that she face plant that </v>

2473
01:41:49.831 --> 01:41:50.050
<v Speaker 3>are on that and then just walked around </v>
<v Speaker 3>the that moment,</v>

2474
01:41:50.410 --> 01:41:52.660
<v Speaker 3>like that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who the fuck understands that moment?</v>

2475
01:41:52.661 --> 01:41:57.661
<v Speaker 3>But her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who are you or anybody who experiences </v>

<v Speaker 3>you know the,</v>

2477
01:41:57.661 --> 01:41:59.470
<v Speaker 3>the moment where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think of like the Edson Barboza fight we</v>

2478
01:41:59.471 --> 01:42:04.471
<v Speaker 3>crack on with that jab and then take his</v>
<v Speaker 3>back like that moment when when your </v>

2479
01:42:04.471 --> 01:42:07.800
<v Speaker 3>taps and you stand up and the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>crowd goes fucking ape shit because it </v>

2480
01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:09.130
<v Speaker 3>was chaos up until that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2481
01:42:09.131 --> 01:42:10.750
<v Speaker 3>He came out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guns blazing.</v>

2482
01:42:10.930 --> 01:42:12.660
<v Speaker 3>Then you caught him with that Jab.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He went down.</v>

2483
01:42:12.670 --> 01:42:15.580
<v Speaker 3>You've got his back and strangle them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That moment man.</v>

2484
01:42:15.700 --> 01:42:17.950
<v Speaker 3>When you were in the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the fire.</v>

2485
01:42:17.980 --> 01:42:20.530
<v Speaker 3>In that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Barbara has as he blinks,</v>

2486
01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:24.700
<v Speaker 3>but in that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about 20 seconds before that moment,</v>

2487
01:42:24.701 --> 01:42:25.360
<v Speaker 3>I knew I got him.</v>

2488
01:42:25.570 --> 01:42:30.570
<v Speaker 3>How'd you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because he hit me with fucking </v>

2489
01:42:30.570 --> 01:42:30.570
<v Speaker 3>everything he had in the kitchen sink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when he unloaded Babe Babe,</v>

<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>

2629
01:48:15.661 --> 01:48:17.400
<v Speaker 3>Unless you take the right amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>mushrooms,</v>

2630
01:48:17.820 --> 01:48:19.070
<v Speaker 3>you can meet leprechauns.</v>

2633
01:48:25.820 --> 01:48:30.080

<v Speaker 3>at the way in,</v>

2640
01:48:44.731 --> 01:48:48.000
<v Speaker 3>he looked extremely drawn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His cheeks were sucked in.</v>

2641
01:48:48.001 --> 01:48:50.280
<v Speaker 3>His body looked really small.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you're Ryan.</v>

2642
01:48:50.281 --> 01:48:55.281
<v Speaker 3>Him had some weird little altercation in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hallway and it wasn't staged,</v>

2643
01:48:55.770 --> 01:49:00.770

<v Speaker 3>He said duty feels really small.</v>

2647
01:49:07.830 --> 01:49:12.830
<v Speaker 3>Like he loses a lot of weight.</v>

<v Speaker 3>able to fight like a fucking assassin,</v>

2707
01:51:27.820 --> 01:51:31.060
<v Speaker 3>even under all the shit talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's ever talked to before,</v>

<v Speaker 3>if you look at him when he's on point,</v>

2712
01:51:39.820 --> 01:51:42.520
<v Speaker 3>you look at it like his fight with Uriah</v>
<v Speaker 3>for instance.</v>

2713
01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:45.940
<v Speaker 3>Some fucking terrifying leg kicks.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's a beast.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I feel like he's in his head.</v>

2720
01:52:03.251 --> 01:52:08.140
<v Speaker 3>I know that trash talk wouldn't work on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but we were talking about that earlier.</v>

2721
01:52:08.141 --> 01:52:10.340
<v Speaker 3>You're coming in too late for this </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation you're talking about.</v>

2722
01:52:10.600 --> 01:52:14.410
<v Speaker 3>He went over to talking about the nate </v>
<v Speaker 3>Diaz fight were jumpers here.</v>

2723
01:52:14.420 --> 01:52:16.550
<v Speaker 3>We would travel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>travel,</v>

2724
01:52:16.810 --> 01:52:21.810
<v Speaker 3>travel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like it to go and it's a great fight </v>

2725
01:52:21.810 --> 01:52:22.480
<v Speaker 3>and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you gotta also,</v>

2726
01:52:22.481 --> 01:52:27.481
<v Speaker 3>I gotta be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I look at Aldo and even though all </v>

2727
01:52:27.481 --> 01:52:28.570
<v Speaker 3>those been dominant for so long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's one of the best fighters.</v>

2728
01:52:29.040 --> 01:52:29.950
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

2729
01:52:30.010 --> 01:52:33.640
<v Speaker 3>he's had a lot of tough fights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those eventually will catch up to you.</v>

2730
01:52:33.790 --> 01:52:37.390
<v Speaker 3>It's like the Chad Mendez fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The last fight was a really good fight.</v>

2731
01:52:37.610 --> 01:52:41.680
<v Speaker 3>It was like a back and forth fight and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Mendez hit him with some fucking bombs.</v>

2732
01:52:41.980 --> 01:52:46.100
<v Speaker 3>It was a great back and forth fight and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he tagged Mendez with a big shot at</v>

2733
01:52:46.100 --> 01:52:51.100
<v Speaker 2>the end of the first round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the Buzzer rang and then he hit </v>

2734
01:52:51.100 --> 01:52:51.100
<v Speaker 2>him like a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a little late,</v>

2735
01:52:51.100 --> 01:52:55.720
<v Speaker 2>wasn't agregious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a little late and at fuck Mendez up </v>

2736
01:52:55.720 --> 01:52:55.720
<v Speaker 2>and Mendez still came back and cracked </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

2737
01:52:55.820 --> 01:52:58.340
<v Speaker 2>It was a back and forth war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a very close fight.</v>

2738
01:52:58.400 --> 01:53:03.400
<v Speaker 2>Has although fought anyone who hits as </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard as Mcgregor Co.</v>

2739
01:53:03.590 --> 01:53:05.960
<v Speaker 2>Well Chad mendez hits pretty fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>hard.</v>

2740
01:53:06.040 --> 01:53:10.160
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think connor may have some special</v>

2741
01:53:10.161 --> 01:53:12.500
<v Speaker 2>poWer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not like a magic power,</v>

2742
01:53:12.620 --> 01:53:16.090
<v Speaker 2>but I think he's one of those guys that </v>
<v Speaker 2>just really as super heavy hand.</v>

2743
01:53:16.091 --> 01:53:19.640
<v Speaker 2>It's so aCcurate is very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's just very smart man.</v>

2744
01:53:19.641 --> 01:53:21.950
<v Speaker 2>The way he fights is very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very intelligent.</v>

2745
01:53:22.220 --> 01:53:27.220
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was joking around with donald about </v>

2746
01:53:27.220 --> 01:53:27.220
<v Speaker 2>his training Methods that he calls it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Him and john.</v>

2747

<v Speaker 2>Kevin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was coast.</v>

2748
01:53:27.460 --> 01:53:32.460
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they described it as upgrading your </v>

2749
01:53:32.460 --> 01:53:32.460
<v Speaker 2>software without damaging your hardware.</v>

2750
01:53:32.630 --> 01:53:37.630
<v Speaker 2>So they're doing all these like really </v>
<v Speaker 2>technical drills on hitting specific </v>

2751
01:53:37.630 --> 01:53:37.630
<v Speaker 2>points,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like you might not be on paper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're.</v>

2877
01:59:23.041 --> 01:59:28.041
<v Speaker 2>They're saying that he might be worth </v>

2878
01:59:28.120 --> 01:59:29.560
<v Speaker 2>crop economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all oil.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Guess who controls it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't do anything without that.</v>

2881
01:59:33.281 --> 01:59:35.110
<v Speaker 2>Russians?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Politics has always been that way.</v>

2882
01:59:35.110 --> 01:59:40.110
<v Speaker 2>It's always been run by azhar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's always been run really by a group </v>

2883
01:59:40.110 --> 01:59:40.110
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2884
01:59:40.110 --> 01:59:44.340
<v Speaker 2>used to be the pull up bureau,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for the most part he's just doing </v>

2885
01:59:44.340 --> 01:59:47.161
<v Speaker 2>what the old russian model was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was get the biggest guns and </v>

2886
01:59:47.161 --> 01:59:50.780
<v Speaker 2>killing what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it a crazy when you see a guy </v>

2887
01:59:50.780 --> 01:59:55.621
<v Speaker 2>who's running like essentially a </v>
<v Speaker 2>complete undercover gangster </v>

2888
01:59:55.621 --> 01:59:55.730
<v Speaker 2>organisation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Monarchy.</v>

2889
01:59:55.900 --> 01:59:57.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dominating entire country.</v>

2890
01:59:57.630 --> 01:59:59.140
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he apparently,</v>

2891
01:59:59.350 --> 02:00:02.470
<v Speaker 2>when they were trying to attract </v>
<v Speaker 2>investment in the nineties,</v>

2892
02:00:02.770 --> 02:00:07.770
<v Speaker 2>the problem was american companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>german companies or french companies </v>

2893
02:00:07.770 --> 02:00:10.180
<v Speaker 2>coming in and these gangsters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these russian guys would come in and go,</v>

2894
02:00:10.450 --> 02:00:11.920
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to pay us money.</v>

2895
02:00:12.220 --> 02:00:17.220
<v Speaker 2>And couple of them said no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they just shot him right there in </v>

2896
02:00:17.220 --> 02:00:17.220
<v Speaker 2>the office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So putting inside of this was gonna be a</v>

2897
02:00:17.220 --> 02:00:19.060
<v Speaker 2>disaster for any kind of foreign </v>
<v Speaker 2>investment.</v>

2898
02:00:19.300 --> 02:00:21.060
<v Speaker 2>So putin said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>

2899
02:00:21.360 --> 02:00:22.450
<v Speaker 2>well I know how to deal with this.</v>

2900
02:00:22.480 --> 02:00:27.480
<v Speaker 2>We know exactly where they are and when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they were having big guys hanging out </v>

2901
02:00:27.480 --> 02:00:27.970
<v Speaker 2>together in their own club houses or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

2902
02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.610
<v Speaker 2>he had these spetsnaz guys show up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their,</v>

2903
02:00:30.850 --> 02:00:35.850
<v Speaker 2>in their vans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just show up in the middle of the </v>

2904
02:00:35.850 --> 02:00:37.980
<v Speaker 2>day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>open up and just killed a shitload of </v>

2905

<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like 100,</v>

2906
02:00:37.980 --> 02:00:39.520
<v Speaker 2>201 day they had a moment of silence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently before he had his,</v>

2907
02:00:39.720 --> 02:00:41.200
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before he had his,</v>

<v Speaker 2>200 citizens that were killed and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>won their business.</v>

2912
02:00:48.550 --> 02:00:53.550
<v Speaker 2>And that was the message to anybody who </v>
<v Speaker 2>saId you want to shake that foreign </v>

<v Speaker 2>like an hour.</v>

3094
02:08:36.220 --> 02:08:37.360
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ask him yourself.</v>

3095
02:08:37.361 --> 02:08:38.550
<v Speaker 2>He's right here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I turned.</v>

3096
02:08:38.570 --> 02:08:40.690
<v Speaker 2>He's looking at a book I read called </v>
<v Speaker 2>fiasco.</v>

3097
02:08:40.691 --> 02:08:42.640
<v Speaker 2>I remember he had his glasses on and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

<v Speaker 2>how you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he goes,</v>

3099
02:08:44.051 --> 02:08:44.650
<v Speaker 2>I met you.</v>

3100
02:08:44.660 --> 02:08:48.300
<v Speaker 2>We talked backstage and all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 2>I realized my eyes.</v>

3101
02:08:48.420 --> 02:08:53.420
<v Speaker 2>I folded my arms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for whatever reason my fucking arms </v>

3102
02:08:53.420 --> 02:08:58.320
<v Speaker 2>were really high and my elbows were </v>
<v Speaker 2>pointed right at him and in my mind I </v>

3103
02:08:58.320 --> 02:08:58.320
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brian,</v>

3104
02:08:58.320 --> 02:08:58.570
<v Speaker 2>please let go of your arms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't do this.</v>

3105
02:08:58.571 --> 02:08:59.680
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I go,</v>

3106
02:08:59.740 --> 02:09:01.120
<v Speaker 2>and this is what I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

3107
02:09:01.330 --> 02:09:02.650
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you ski?</v>

3108
02:09:03.010 --> 02:09:04.810
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>usually we do,</v>

3109
02:09:04.811 --> 02:09:07.270
<v Speaker 2>but this year we just let the kids do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we're just sitting,</v>

3110
02:09:07.600 --> 02:09:12.600
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I went and I meant to say I fucking </v>

3111
02:09:12.600 --> 02:09:15.040
<v Speaker 2>meant to say I've been skiing all day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My feet are killing me and I'm not going</v>

3112
02:09:15.041 --> 02:09:16.700
<v Speaker 2>to ski anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I meant.</v>

3113
02:09:16.710 --> 02:09:18.220
<v Speaker 2>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been skiing all day.</v>

3114
02:09:18.370 --> 02:09:21.100
<v Speaker 2>My boots are shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to ski anymore.</v>

3115
02:09:21.640 --> 02:09:24.310
<v Speaker 2>And instead I went with my fucking arms </v>
<v Speaker 2>like this,</v>

3116
02:09:24.311 --> 02:09:26.380
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my feet are killing me.</v>

3117
02:09:27.520 --> 02:09:28.990
<v Speaker 2>And he just looked at me and there was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>pause.</v>

02:13:31.721 --> 02:13:31.721
<v Speaker 2>this area and you drive the range rover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3206
02:13:31.721 --> 02:13:35.370
<v Speaker 2>That's your status.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that that term society,</v>

3207
02:13:37.110 --> 02:13:42.110
<v Speaker 2>I think that's changing pretty well </v>
<v Speaker 2>because of the internet people like </v>

3208
02:13:42.961 --> 02:13:47.961
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of people that don't </v>

3209
02:13:47.961 --> 02:13:48.300
<v Speaker 2>think like that and now they can all </v>
<v Speaker 2>agree.</v>

3210
02:13:48.660 --> 02:13:52.860
<v Speaker 2>Whereas before what was put out in front</v>
<v Speaker 2>of you was what was on commercials.</v>

3211
02:13:53.010 --> 02:13:55.590
<v Speaker 2>What was you saw the hero have in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie?</v>

3212
02:13:55.740 --> 02:14:00.740
<v Speaker 2>Burt reynolds as a trans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I fucking need a trans am like all </v>

3213
02:14:00.740 --> 02:14:04.401
<v Speaker 2>that stuff was the only way we </v>
<v Speaker 2>associated with ideas about items,</v>

3214
02:14:05.280 --> 02:14:08.490
<v Speaker 2>but now because the internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll talk to people that go,</v>

3215
02:14:08.491 --> 02:14:09.850
<v Speaker 2>you know what man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

3216
02:14:09.860 --> 02:14:14.860
<v Speaker 2>I live in a fucking trailer that drive </v>
<v Speaker 2>around in my truck and I just go to </v>

3217
02:14:14.860 --> 02:14:15.630
<v Speaker 2>different places and I climb mountains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like that.</v>

3218
02:14:15.640 --> 02:14:17.770
<v Speaker 2>Alex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He lives in a van.</v>

3219
02:14:17.790 --> 02:14:20.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's cool too.</v>

3220
02:14:20.071 --> 02:14:21.960
<v Speaker 2>And he'll find fans.</v>

3221
02:14:21.970 --> 02:14:23.880
<v Speaker 2>The people that admire him because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3222
02:14:24.040 --> 02:14:25.740
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that like.</v>

3223
02:14:25.741 --> 02:14:30.741
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that some people who chase </v>

3224
02:14:30.741 --> 02:14:30.741
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has a lot of meaning.</v>

3225
02:14:30.741 --> 02:14:31.530
<v Speaker 2>Some people were humiliated by being </v>
<v Speaker 2>poor when they were kids.</v>

3226
02:14:31.760 --> 02:14:33.750
<v Speaker 2>Money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes them feel powerful,</v>

3227
02:14:33.751 --> 02:14:34.500
<v Speaker 2>safe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

3228
02:14:34.501 --> 02:14:37.920
<v Speaker 2>But like I was thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was trying to isolate of the two times</v>

3229
02:14:37.921 --> 02:14:42.921
<v Speaker 2>I'm the most happy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the two things that mattereD to me </v>

3230
02:14:42.921 --> 02:14:43.620
<v Speaker 2>the most with my friends and getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>better at something.</v>

3231

<v Speaker 2>you're not fucking just tickled pink.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you drive,</v>

3238
02:15:05.641 --> 02:15:10.641
<v Speaker 2>it's a pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you enjoy it and it changes your </v>
