1
00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:05.610
<v Speaker 1>Low Freak bitches and then there was another time when I had to get permission</v>

2
00:00:05.611 --> 00:00:06.291
<v Speaker 1>to discern bad.</v>

3
00:00:06.291 --> 00:00:07.980
<v Speaker 1>One of my cameramen from the US army,</v>

4
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:09.923
<v Speaker 1>Jake,</v>

5
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.950
<v Speaker 1>camera guy from Australia that I hired who lives there and I had a decent bet</v>

6
00:00:13.951 --> 00:00:16.950
<v Speaker 1>him from the US army because he was going on a mission with the Afghans.</v>

7
00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:17.790
<v Speaker 1>When you say he lives there,</v>

8
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:18.920
<v Speaker 1>he lives in Afghanistan.</v>

9
00:00:18.921 --> 00:00:19.560
<v Speaker 1>In Kabul.</v>

10
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.340
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

11
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.870
<v Speaker 1>He's a war is a war journalist.</v>

12
00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.490
<v Speaker 1>She lives there all year round.</v>

13
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:23.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

14
00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.540
<v Speaker 1>and now he's moving to places where he can cover isis.</v>

15
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:31.020
<v Speaker 1>He's an interesting guy and so and so.</v>

16
00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:34.440
<v Speaker 1>Jake had to embed with the Afghans and I had to go meet with a general to get</v>

17
00:00:34.441 --> 00:00:37.230
<v Speaker 1>permission to get him in bed with the Afghans [inaudible].</v>

18
00:00:37.231 --> 00:00:41.190
<v Speaker 1>There was no US forces on the ground where he was going and it was a place</v>

19
00:00:41.191 --> 00:00:42.090
<v Speaker 1>called the Tangi Valley.</v>

20
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.260
<v Speaker 1>Very Dangerous Valley.</v>

21
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.290
<v Speaker 1>The site of the law,</v>

22
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.930
<v Speaker 1>single largest loss of life of US service members at 38,</v>

23
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.960
<v Speaker 1>died in a Chinook that was shot down by RPG in that valley and it was a really</v>

24
00:00:54.031 --> 00:00:57.360
<v Speaker 1>important mission because the Tango Valley is just outside Kabul,</v>

25
00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.970
<v Speaker 1>but it's a Taliban stronghold so they can,</v>

26
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.590
<v Speaker 1>they can plan their operations and attack cool very quickly from the tiny</v>

27
00:01:04.591 --> 00:01:05.424
<v Speaker 1>valley.</v>

28
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.460
<v Speaker 1>And so it was important that we told the story and so I went to talk with the</v>

29
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.480
<v Speaker 1>General Townsend and he said,</v>

30
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:13.261
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

31
00:01:13.261 --> 00:01:14.500
<v Speaker 1>so you know,</v>

32
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.590
<v Speaker 1>are you prepared to see your camera guy?</v>

33
00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:17.510
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

34
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.700
<v Speaker 1>in an orange jumpsuit on his knees,</v>

36
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.370
<v Speaker 1>on the Internet because the place you're putting in,</v>

37
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.220
<v Speaker 1>that's the kind of thing that happens and nobody's going to go get him.</v>

38
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.730
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

39
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.270
<v Speaker 1>no US allies or us,</v>

40
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.153
<v Speaker 1>we'll go get him.</v>

41
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:30.120
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

42
00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.050
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't said yes.</v>

43
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.230
<v Speaker 1>And that was probably the hardest moment because I had to make a conscious</v>

44
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.430
<v Speaker 1>conscious decision.</v>

45
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.391
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

46
00:01:36.391 --> 00:01:38.220
<v Speaker 1>Then just say yes.</v>

47
00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.840
<v Speaker 1>Did you express this to him?</v>

48
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:41.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

49
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.611
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

50
00:01:41.611 --> 00:01:41.851
<v Speaker 1>Jake,</v>

51
00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:43.110
<v Speaker 1>Jake knows jake.</v>

52
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.510
<v Speaker 1>Jake knew Jake's.</v>

53
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:46.230
<v Speaker 1>Jake's.</v>

54
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.160
<v Speaker 1>Did you tell him that?</v>

55
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.660
<v Speaker 1>That that was the sentence.</v>

56
00:01:48.661 --> 00:01:50.250
<v Speaker 1>That was the way it was described to you.</v>

57
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

58
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:51.240
<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

59
00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.073
<v Speaker 1>What did he say?</v>

60
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.831
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>

61
00:01:52.831 --> 00:01:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Ricky and his cheerful Australian attitudes.</v>

62
00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.230
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>

63
00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:59.800
<v Speaker 1>Fucking Australians.</v>

64
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:00.350
<v Speaker 1>They're crazy,</v>

65
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.020
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>

66
00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.853
<v Speaker 1>crazy</v>

67
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.580
<v Speaker 1>bull.</v>

68
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.950
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>

69
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:05.460
<v Speaker 1>he's a boy.</v>

70
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.293
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

71
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:07.740
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like a nutty dude.</v>

72
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.251
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

73
00:02:08.251 --> 00:02:09.510
<v Speaker 1>what motivates that guy?</v>

74
00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.750
<v Speaker 1>Jake?</v>

75
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:11.583
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

76
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.940
<v Speaker 1>was in the Australian army and I think he was involved with some,</v>

77
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.270
<v Speaker 1>some event that was really traumatizing involving,</v>

78
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

79
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.610
<v Speaker 1>some kids getting hurt and killed.</v>

80
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.810
<v Speaker 1>And so it was somewhere in Indonesia where the Australians were I think.</v>

81
00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.950
<v Speaker 1>And so he ever since has been involved ever since that event.</v>

82
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:30.330
<v Speaker 1>And then a left the army,</v>

83
00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.000
<v Speaker 1>he's been trying to tell the story of how war affects kids and so he's got a</v>

84
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:38.620
<v Speaker 1>special focus on kids and so that's,</v>

85
00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:39.680
<v Speaker 1>that's what motivates jake,</v>

86
00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:40.514
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

87
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.260
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>

88
00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.810
<v Speaker 1>he does this three 65.</v>

89
00:02:42.811 --> 00:02:43.890
<v Speaker 1>He's over there all the time.</v>

90
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.430
<v Speaker 1>All the time to some yearn for a normal life.</v>

91
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.480
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

92
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.190
<v Speaker 1>he actually learns for the next gunfight.</v>

93
00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.980
<v Speaker 1>He yearns for the next gunfight.</v>

94
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.320
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

95
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.550
<v Speaker 1>he's one of those guys that chase has gunfights around the world who looked just</v>

96
00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of sexual appetites and I know there's guys I know guys</v>

97
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.200
<v Speaker 2>don't like to be smacked around and tied up.</v>

98
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.970
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>

99
00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.130
<v Speaker 2>I have a friend who likes doing that fucking weird shit.</v>

100
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.881
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

101
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:08.290
<v Speaker 2>I used to work for a dominatrix.</v>

102
00:03:08.291 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't working for her as a Dominatrix,</v>

103
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:10.981
<v Speaker 2>but she,</v>

104
00:03:10.981 --> 00:03:14.530
<v Speaker 2>I worked in her clothing store and she was also a dominatrix this German woman</v>

105
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.750
<v Speaker 2>and she would go piss on people.</v>

106
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:18.850
<v Speaker 2>She would just like,</v>

107
00:03:18.851 --> 00:03:21.680
<v Speaker 2>it was so funny and she had this crazy accent and she'd answer,</v>

108
00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

109
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.140
<v Speaker 2>one line she was ordering,</v>

110
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:23.621
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

111
00:03:23.621 --> 00:03:25.120
<v Speaker 2>fabric and then the other line she's like,</v>

112
00:03:25.121 --> 00:03:25.954
<v Speaker 2>what are you into?</v>

113
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.310
<v Speaker 2>Do you want me to jog around the block?</v>

114
00:03:27.311 --> 00:03:28.091

<v Speaker 2>she had to wear white underwear and he just wanted to use a flashlight and look</v>

121
00:03:41.141 --> 00:03:42.760
<v Speaker 2>up her skirt for like an hour.</v>

122
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.110
<v Speaker 2>She would get paid so much.</v>

123
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.590
<v Speaker 2>At one time I went over to her house to get paid and she had a man blind folded</v>

124
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.580
<v Speaker 2>on the floor crawling and he was just smelling her boots while she was writing</v>

125

00:03:55.571 --> 00:03:56.620
<v Speaker 2>It was so funny.</v>

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.520
<v Speaker 3>Did you ever hear the Central Park Story?</v>

131
00:03:58.521 --> 00:03:59.354
<v Speaker 3>It wouldn't be annoying.</v>

132
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:00.323
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

133
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.940
<v Speaker 3>this is a class three.</v>

134
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:05.470
<v Speaker 3>Here we go.</v>

135
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:06.190
<v Speaker 3>Tell this story.</v>

136
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.023
<v Speaker 3>Crack my fingers.</v>

137
00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:08.350
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

138
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.561
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

139
00:04:08.561 --> 00:04:09.394
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

140
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.460
<v Speaker 3>we're coming out of somewhere,</v>

141
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.440
<v Speaker 3>maybe a 12 step meeting or whatever,</v>

142
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:15.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

143
00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.550
<v Speaker 3>and there's a hot hot black chick walks by and recognizes me from.</v>

144
00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:23.410
<v Speaker 3>And I wasn't even maybe from a club.</v>

145
00:04:23.411 --> 00:04:23.980
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>

146
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.090
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I did one TV show her two when my life should I show it to her?</v>

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:31.490
<v Speaker 3>just trying to get a real clear picture of what actually happened.</v>

238
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:33.400
<v Speaker 3>It couldn't be any clearer.</v>

<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

242
00:06:37.341 --> 00:06:40.130

00:06:44.091 --> 00:06:47.180
<v Speaker 3>let's take a ride up to central park and we were walking through central park</v>

250
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.140

251
00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:52.453
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

252
