00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:47.980
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting.</v>

30
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.460
<v Speaker 1>I have had nothing but positive feedback</v>
<v Speaker 1>from squarespace.</v>

31
00:01:51.461 --> 00:01:54.180
<v Speaker 1>Anybody that have turned onto it is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has,</v>

32
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.250
<v Speaker 1>becomes a huge fan once you start using </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and they're so confident about it </v>

33
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.191
<v Speaker 1>that they allow you to use squarespace </v>
<v Speaker 1>without entering your credit card </v>

34
00:02:02.191 --> 00:02:03.340
<v Speaker 1>information first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when you say,</v>

35
00:02:03.341 --> 00:02:04.780
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking awesome.</v>

36
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.990
<v Speaker 1>Then you enter in your credit card </v>
<v Speaker 1>information and then you actually get </v>

37
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.721
<v Speaker 1>charged for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they'll let you try it out and see </v>

38
00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:12.721
<v Speaker 1>what the website would look like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

39
00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:14.530
<v Speaker 1>it's just really impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

40
00:02:14.531 --> 00:02:17.530
<v Speaker 1>we had a contest and we've talked about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

41
00:02:17.531 --> 00:02:22.531
<v Speaker 1>but I'll just say it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was really kind of unfair because </v>

42
00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:23.980
<v Speaker 1>there were so many different people made</v>
<v Speaker 1>awesome websites.</v>

43
00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.410
<v Speaker 1>To pick four is that we picked four to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pick four,</v>

44
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.050
<v Speaker 1>so it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not fair.</v>

45
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:30.880
<v Speaker 1>There was too many guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I met some comics are talking about that</v>

46
00:02:30.881 --> 00:02:35.881
<v Speaker 1>in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were entering into some cottons of </v>

47
00:02:35.881 --> 00:02:38.571
<v Speaker 1>the contest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was too many people that have </v>

48
00:02:38.571 --> 00:02:38.620
<v Speaker 1>awesome websites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we picked some wicked ones.</v>

49
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.450
<v Speaker 1>Point is these are not people that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever done anything like that before.</v>

50
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.280
<v Speaker 1>There are people that for the most part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe for web designers.</v>

51
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.860
<v Speaker 1>I think there were just folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might be wrong about that.</v>

52
00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.340
<v Speaker 1>Either way they use squarespace to do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can too.</v>

53
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.310
<v Speaker 1>It's not like they get magic access to </v>
<v Speaker 1>special tools.</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

169
00:08:18.411 --> 00:08:22.320
<v Speaker 1>if you take a Alpha brain or if you take</v>
<v Speaker 1>one and you're having a pity party,</v>

170
00:08:22.321 --> 00:08:24.870
<v Speaker 1>but you're also giving yourself some </v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrients,</v>

171
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.530
<v Speaker 1>all pity parties are putting nutrients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go in there.</v>

172
00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:30.720
<v Speaker 1>It's a bunch of shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Alpha brain.</v>

174
00:08:32.611 --> 00:08:32.860
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

175
00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:34.590
<v Speaker 1>we recently got done with the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

176
00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:39.750
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first results published a clinical </v>

177
00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:42.261
<v Speaker 1>test of a Alpha brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>double blind placebo tests and showed </v>

178
00:08:42.261 --> 00:08:47.061
<v Speaker 1>positive results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We printed it all up on [inaudible] dot </v>

179
00:08:47.061 --> 00:08:47.061
<v Speaker 1>com.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

180
00:08:47.061 --> 00:08:47.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the things there for anybody to,</v>

181
00:08:47.811 --> 00:08:50.160
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go investigate and check it out.</v>

182
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:55.170
<v Speaker 1>And we're in the middle of a much larger</v>
<v Speaker 1>scale to this was the first one was </v>

183
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:55.920
<v Speaker 1>something called a pilot test with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pilot test.</v>

184
00:08:55.921 --> 00:08:58.950
<v Speaker 1>You only use 20 people had a couple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dropped out,</v>

185
00:08:58.951 --> 00:09:00.000
<v Speaker 1>three dropped out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe.</v>

186
00:09:00.001 --> 00:09:02.520
<v Speaker 1>So I think we were left with 17 or 16.</v>

187
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:05.120
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember exactly where they just</v>

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:08.310
<v Speaker 1>just give up they want to do anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the people that stayed,</v>

189
00:09:08.311 --> 00:09:10.740
<v Speaker 1>that used Alpha brain showed an </v>
<v Speaker 1>improvement.</v>

190
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:13.430
<v Speaker 1>They showed improvement in memory.</v>

192
00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:18.500
<v Speaker 1>don't totally understand how these </v>
<v Speaker 1>things work.</v>

198
00:09:33.810 --> 00:09:38.810
<v Speaker 1>There's plenty of science behind all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these individual ingredients that we </v>

199
00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:39.780
<v Speaker 1>use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's an Alpha brain,</v>

200

<v Speaker 1>you enjoy something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like at least I do.</v>

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:34.200
<v Speaker 1>If I enjoy something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to buy it.</v>

221
00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.750
<v Speaker 1>That's how I feel like whether it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>want anybody's money.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Exactly,</v>

223
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:41.750
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm,</v>

224
00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:43.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm honest about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love this stuff.</v>

225
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.260
<v Speaker 1>I've taken all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it wasn't for that,</v>

226
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:51.440
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get a little nervous if I have to do </v>

227
00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.740
<v Speaker 1>something and I don't have it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not that I need it,</v>

228
00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:55.920

229
00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:58.350
<v Speaker 1>Not that I need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like a drug addict,</v>

230
00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:01.200
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying it is very much like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>drug addict.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm a drug addict for healthy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

232
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:06.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are totally what?</v>

233
00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:11.490
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somewhere what's an ideal heart rate </v>

234
00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:13.641
<v Speaker 1>when you're working at a thousand?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't want to go over 180 is </v>

235
00:11:14.341 --> 00:11:16.250
<v Speaker 1>probably about as high as you ever want </v>
<v Speaker 1>to go.</v>

236
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:19.770
<v Speaker 1>What are you up to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One 71 80.</v>

237
00:11:19.771 --> 00:11:24.771
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking red line and shit on the </v>

238
00:11:24.771 --> 00:11:24.771
<v Speaker 1>clips on their fingers.</v>

239
00:11:24.771 --> 00:11:28.850
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like when they have those little </v>

240
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:28.850
<v Speaker 1>things you put your hands on when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>working out those accurate.</v>

241
00:11:28.850 --> 00:11:29.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those are accurate.</v>

242
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:34.750
<v Speaker 1>You have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you can go over one 80 about </v>

243
00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:37.431
<v Speaker 1>probably the most anybody ever doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>in athletic competition and I would </v>

244
00:11:37.431 --> 00:11:39.530
<v Speaker 1>guess it's probably like in the two </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of like the early 200,</v>

245
00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.040
<v Speaker 1>like maybe to 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

246
00:11:41.070 --> 00:11:42.720
<v Speaker 1>Let's be frightened as people are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the highest?</v>

247
00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:48.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I know there's an ideal heart </v>

248
00:11:48.090 --> 00:11:50.001
<v Speaker 1>rate that you want to just kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>coast stat as much as possible and </v>

249
00:11:50.001 --> 00:11:50.790
<v Speaker 1>really that just like shreds through </v>
<v Speaker 1>calories more than.</v>

250
00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just keep that going.</v>

251
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:54.460
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I'm also,</v>

252
00:11:55.820 --> 00:12:00.820
<v Speaker 3>I was looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was looking at the guy next to me and </v>

253
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.621
<v Speaker 3>he tried,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he did his and he was like one 62 and </v>

254
00:12:02.621 --> 00:12:02.621
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh shit.</v>

255
00:12:02.621 --> 00:12:03.270
<v Speaker 3>You know what's the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was about the thought.</v>

256
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.280
<v Speaker 3>I really like him.</v>

257
00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:06.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's ridiculous.</v>

258
00:12:07.170 --> 00:12:09.830
<v Speaker 2>That's died of a heart attack or just he</v>
<v Speaker 2>just dot,</v>

259
00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:10.560
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the,</v>

260
00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:14.880
<v Speaker 2>here's your maximum heart rate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're 20 years old,</v>

261
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:17.670
<v Speaker 2>up to 100.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seventy pounds is,</v>

262
00:12:17.671 --> 00:12:19.810
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's 200 planes.</v>

263
00:12:19.830 --> 00:12:22.920
<v Speaker 2>Neither of those two things don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>

264
00:12:22.921 --> 00:12:25.600
<v Speaker 2>do I just doubled that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

265
00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.090
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I read this incorrectly.</v>

266
00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:30.600
<v Speaker 2>It's not up to 170 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have the pounds factor.</v>

267
00:12:30.601 --> 00:12:33.600
<v Speaker 2>Then it's actually a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your target rate.</v>

268
00:12:33.601 --> 00:12:38.601
<v Speaker 2>Heart zone is one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the other one was your predicted </v>

269
00:12:38.601 --> 00:12:40.300
<v Speaker 2>maximum heart rate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your target raise between 1:20</v>

270
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:45.310
<v Speaker 2>and one slash 70 if you're 20 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just gave it a cursory glance and your</v>

271
00:12:46.021 --> 00:12:48.780
<v Speaker 2>maximum is somewhere around 200.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as you get older,</v>

272
00:12:48.781 --> 00:12:53.100
<v Speaker 2>your maximum drops and drops and drops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

273
00:12:53.101 --> 00:12:54.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking dying.</v>

274
00:12:55.490 --> 00:12:58.590
<v Speaker 2>That freaks me out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it goes away.</v>

275
00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:59.970
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to start slow.</v>

276
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:01.350
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You haven't been working out.</v>

277
00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:03.900
<v Speaker 2>If you're really going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one thing that I always stress.</v>

278
00:13:03.901 --> 00:13:04.880
<v Speaker 2>If anybody says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

279
00:13:04.881 --> 00:13:07.470
<v Speaker 2>I want to start doing kettlebells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>

280
00:13:07.530 --> 00:13:09.660
<v Speaker 2>Whatever you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>start slow,</v>

281
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:14.040
<v Speaker 2>get some light weights and just work on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the form and work on getting it down and</v>

282
00:13:14.041 --> 00:13:17.340
<v Speaker 2>then do it so that you can do 15 of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those comfortably.</v>

283
00:13:17.341 --> 00:13:21.930
<v Speaker 2>Then bumped yourself up to 35 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then pump yourself up again and you know</v>

284
00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:24.750
<v Speaker 2>x amount of months later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but do it slowly.</v>

285
00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:27.240
<v Speaker 2>If you do it slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will get strong like,</v>

286
00:13:27.241 --> 00:13:30.060
<v Speaker 2>everybody's got this idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go to fucking do it all today.</v>

287
00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:33.600
<v Speaker 2>Don't do it all today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't do it slowly.</v>

288
00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:36.840
<v Speaker 2>Work on your form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Learn the movements and yeah,</v>

289
00:13:36.841 --> 00:13:38.690
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to feel like an </v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievable workout.</v>

290
00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:41.040
<v Speaker 2>The first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know x amount of times you do it,</v>

291
00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:46.220
<v Speaker 2>but ultimately you're going to build up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're going to get yourself into a </v>

292
00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:46.830
<v Speaker 2>position where your muscles are </v>
<v Speaker 2>protected to.</v>

293
00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:49.710
<v Speaker 2>You're doing heavy shit and your body's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not used to it.</v>

294
00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.960
<v Speaker 2>You want to make sure that your joints </v>
<v Speaker 2>are stable.</v>

295
00:13:51.961 --> 00:13:54.570
<v Speaker 2>You want to make sure that your core is </v>
<v Speaker 2>strong.</v>

296
00:13:54.810 --> 00:13:59.810
<v Speaker 2>You want to take care of all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>different problem areas that the worst </v>

297
00:13:59.810 --> 00:14:02.700
<v Speaker 2>thing that can happen is if you're doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a strength and conditioning workout</v>

298
00:14:02.701 --> 00:14:05.820
<v Speaker 2>is you fucking hurt yourself because </v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're just going to get bombed out</v>

299
00:14:05.821 --> 00:14:08.670
<v Speaker 2>about exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to gain more weight.</v>

300
00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.110
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have a pity party.</v>

301
00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:13.250
<v Speaker 3>You guys agree with any of this guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

302
00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.230
<v Speaker 3>you're not in shape.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to get in shape right now.</v>

303
00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.120
<v Speaker 3>Do it today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get it done today.</v>

304
00:14:18.150 --> 00:14:20.420
<v Speaker 3>Reach for the stars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't become like pinette.</v>

305
00:14:20.450 --> 00:14:25.450
<v Speaker 3>Do extra work getting shaped today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't listen to the losers like Joe </v>

306
00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:26.140
<v Speaker 3>Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who doesn't it</v>

307
00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:28.520
<v Speaker 2>the heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going through a real workout.</v>

308
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:32.320
<v Speaker 2>The real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The real problem with all this,</v>

309
00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:33.590
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

310
00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:39.560
<v Speaker 2>is that people have to ramp up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what people have a hard time </v>

311
00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.390
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do ultimately have to ramp up,</v>

312
00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:44.210
<v Speaker 2>like you got to start slow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

313
00:14:44.211 --> 00:14:46.820
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be fine in the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm telling you right now,</v>

314
00:14:46.821 --> 00:14:48.830
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be fucking hell if you do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it right.</v>

315
00:14:49.070 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 2>If you really want to get in shape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have to go through the</v>

316
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:54.860
<v Speaker 1>fires and if you're not willing to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the fires,</v>

317
00:14:55.130 --> 00:15:00.130
<v Speaker 1>you're going to always maintain a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain level of fitness.</v>

318
00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.440
<v Speaker 1>You're never going to get really strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're never going to get really fast.</v>

319
00:15:03.441 --> 00:15:08.441
<v Speaker 1>You're never going to get in good shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to be able to push yourself but </v>

320
00:15:08.441 --> 00:15:09.260
<v Speaker 1>do it correctly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you do do it,</v>

321
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:12.230
<v Speaker 1>Goddamn you'll feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything will work better.</v>

322
00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:13.970
<v Speaker 1>What did you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

323
00:15:13.971 --> 00:15:15.890
<v Speaker 1>because this is my first time back in </v>
<v Speaker 1>two years,</v>

324
00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:19.130
<v Speaker 1>so I just did 20 minutes on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>elliptical,</v>

325
00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:20.810
<v Speaker 1>but at a high level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

326
00:15:20.811 --> 00:15:23.060
<v Speaker 1>but so it was like I was climbing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain type thing.</v>

327
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:26.090
<v Speaker 1>Was your body like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is it got to a point where</v>

328
00:15:26.130 --> 00:15:28.310
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my legs felt numb.</v>

329
00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:29.600
<v Speaker 1>Like I felt like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>

330
00:15:29.601 --> 00:15:31.970
<v Speaker 1>I can't feel my legs anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to fall down.</v>

331
00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:37.740
<v Speaker 1>And then I just did the machines where I</v>
<v Speaker 1>started from one machine and we went </v>

332
00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:39.440
<v Speaker 1>through all the machines and did like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

333
00:15:39.441 --> 00:15:43.820
<v Speaker 1>seven minute reps of all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have all force yourself to do this.</v>

334
00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:45.720
<v Speaker 1>I smelled a battle rope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had one there.</v>

335
00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:47.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to see it with some of those</v>

336
00:15:47.421 --> 00:15:48.910
<v Speaker 1>are battle ropes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

337
00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:50.480
<v Speaker 1>I thought those were like tie you up </v>
<v Speaker 1>ropes.</v>

338
00:15:50.790 --> 00:15:51.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>those are the ones on the far left are </v>
<v Speaker 1>the heavy shipyard ones.</v>

341
00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:00.530
<v Speaker 1>They're pretty dope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a bunch of different weights and</v>

342
00:16:00.531 --> 00:16:05.210
<v Speaker 1>sizes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a 40 inch ones or the 50 inch ones.</v>

343
00:16:05.211 --> 00:16:07.790
<v Speaker 1>Men Get their fucking fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's subliminal.</v>

344
00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:08.360
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>

437
00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:52.050
<v Speaker 4>we all do.</v>

438
00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:53.560
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's true and he will </v>
<v Speaker 4>sue the fuck out looking for anything.</v>

439
00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:54.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't say his name.</v>

440
00:20:54.971 --> 00:20:55.570
<v Speaker 4>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

441
00:20:55.571 --> 00:20:58.740
<v Speaker 4>candy man.</v>

00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:04.260

<v Speaker 4>They're probably not the healthiest </v>

443
00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:08.400
<v Speaker 4>mentally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only reason I knew his name was </v>

444
00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:08.830
<v Speaker 4>because he was a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

445
00:21:08.831 --> 00:21:11.410
<v Speaker 4>he was just any other manager,</v>
<v Speaker 4>owner.</v>

446
00:21:11.411 --> 00:21:12.640
<v Speaker 4>It's like you don't even know who they </v>
<v Speaker 4>are.</v>

447
00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:17.910
<v Speaker 4>They just do their job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only reason I knew who he was in </v>

448
00:21:17.910 --> 00:21:20.791
<v Speaker 4>anybody's still talks about him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's because he was a problem without </v>

449
00:21:20.791 --> 00:21:21.040
<v Speaker 4>saying his name again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One time,</v>

450
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:26.380
<v Speaker 4>one time we showed up at the Improv and </v>

<v Speaker 4>some big deal.</v>

453
00:21:31.601 --> 00:21:36.601
<v Speaker 4>There's a video that plays,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if the show starts at eight and </v>

483
00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.950
<v Speaker 4>like it's not like he's your employer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He like,</v>

484
00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:41.310

<v Speaker 4>I'm going to go on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you're like,</v>

490
00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:50.930
<v Speaker 4>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So go for it,</v>

491
00:22:50.930 --> 00:22:51.850
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well I just,</v>

492
00:22:51.851 --> 00:22:56.500
<v Speaker 4>my attitude was um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether it's you or anybody or Duncan or</v>

493
00:22:56.530 --> 00:23:01.530
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>any of the guys I took on the road with </v>

494
00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:01.530
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I already know.</v>

495
00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:01.530
<v Speaker 4>You're funny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

496
00:23:01.530 --> 00:23:03.310
<v Speaker 4>Like it doesn't matter if you go up and </v>
<v Speaker 4>eat shit.</v>

497
00:23:03.311 --> 00:23:04.630
<v Speaker 4>I know we don't have to impress you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

498
00:23:04.631 --> 00:23:06.610
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to impress me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He can't get fired.</v>

499
00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:11.690
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like all you have to do is just keep </v>

500
00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:11.690
<v Speaker 4>being you and we're golden.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you go up to high,</v>

501
00:23:11.690 --> 00:23:14.560
<v Speaker 4>it'd be hilarious for all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was too.</v>

502
00:23:14.570 --> 00:23:18.100
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My bits,</v>

503
00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.500
<v Speaker 4>as long as you're willing to explain </v>
<v Speaker 4>that to the audience,</v>

504
00:23:20.501 --> 00:23:23.350
<v Speaker 4>it becomes unique experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know that.</v>

505
00:23:23.351 --> 00:23:27.130
<v Speaker 4>Then I told them I couldn't think of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bit and I was like,</v>

506
00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:29.680
<v Speaker 4>and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey joe Rogan's coming up soon.</v>

507
00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.160
<v Speaker 4>And they all went crazy and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why would I have said that?</v>

508
00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:37.900
<v Speaker 4>That's being too high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure what to do.</v>

509
00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:41.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it makes it fun for me in the back.</v>

510
00:23:42.390 --> 00:23:45.350
<v Speaker 4>It's fun for us out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

511
00:23:45.351 --> 00:23:46.160
<v Speaker 4>it's also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you pulled</v>

512
00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:47.980
<v Speaker 6>it out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's still a great show.</v>

513
00:23:47.981 --> 00:23:49.910
<v Speaker 6>It was just really obvious that you were</v>
<v Speaker 6>high.</v>

514
00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:51.740
<v Speaker 6>I'll tell you what though,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that second set,</v>

515
00:23:51.741 --> 00:23:54.050
<v Speaker 6>that night I was going to real good </v>
<v Speaker 6>buzz.</v>

516
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:59.110
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and that was a fun set because I can </v>

517
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.110
<v Speaker 6>remember my bits and also be free enough</v>
<v Speaker 6>to refer around.</v>

518
00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:00.470
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that's the way to do it.</v>

519
00:24:00.471 --> 00:24:05.471
<v Speaker 6>I think it's like he get real high and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then you wait a long time and then you </v>

520
00:24:05.471 --> 00:24:09.251
<v Speaker 6>go on stage until told us over the hump,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you're coming down when you can </v>

521
00:24:09.251 --> 00:24:12.740
<v Speaker 6>handle it like an hour and a half in </v>
<v Speaker 6>when it's all smooth sailing.</v>

522
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:14.310
<v Speaker 6>You don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Matt Edgar was doing for awhile.</v>

523
00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.680
<v Speaker 6>What?</v>
<v Speaker 6>First hit of the day.</v>

524
00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:18.230
<v Speaker 6>They'd be like when?</v>
<v Speaker 6>When the guy got the light before him,</v>

525
00:24:18.231 --> 00:24:19.220
<v Speaker 6>let me see.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's three minutes.</v>

526
00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:20.540
<v Speaker 6>He'd go to the back and he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all right,</v>

527
00:24:20.541 --> 00:24:21.140
<v Speaker 6>let's start smoking.</v>

528
00:24:21.170 --> 00:24:22.880
<v Speaker 6>And was just smoke a shit low until </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

529
00:24:22.881 --> 00:24:23.360
<v Speaker 6>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's it.</v>

530
00:24:23.470 --> 00:24:26.000
<v Speaker 6>That's my time button because I run out </v>
<v Speaker 6>and go right on.</v>

531
00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:28.430
<v Speaker 6>It would hit him when he was on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wow,</v>

532
00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:29.550
<v Speaker 6>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

533
00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:32.710
<v Speaker 6>it's a bold move.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's also a,</v>

534
00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:36.230
<v Speaker 6>probably the most creative time,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like when you just wake up,</v>

535
00:24:36.231 --> 00:24:41.231
<v Speaker 6>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you wake and bake and people think </v>

536
00:24:41.231 --> 00:24:42.230
<v Speaker 6>that waken baking is really like kantar </v>
<v Speaker 6>counterproductive and you know,</v>

537
00:24:42.231 --> 00:24:47.231
<v Speaker 6>waste your day,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're not going to get never really </v>

538
00:24:47.231 --> 00:24:48.230
<v Speaker 6>done what I have done it like in bed.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

539
00:24:48.231 --> 00:24:49.310
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

540
00:24:49.311 --> 00:24:54.311
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've done it like one of the first </v>

541
00:24:54.311 --> 00:24:55.751
<v Speaker 6>things in the morning and I've done it </v>
<v Speaker 6>one on days where I have to do a lot of </v>

542
00:24:55.751 --> 00:24:55.751
<v Speaker 6>heavy writing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh really?</v>

543
00:24:55.751 --> 00:25:00.721
<v Speaker 6>And I seem like it seems like everything</v>
<v Speaker 6>is really firing early in the morning </v>

544
00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:05.270
<v Speaker 6>when you've had a couple of hits.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Seems like creativity is enhanced by the</v>

545
00:25:05.271 --> 00:25:07.490
<v Speaker 6>rest.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like creativity is.</v>

546
00:25:07.491 --> 00:25:11.300
<v Speaker 6>I'm wondering in general to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well a lot of times man and people don't</v>

547
00:25:11.301 --> 00:25:16.301
<v Speaker 6>think about it that way because you </v>
<v Speaker 6>think of morning is like when you have </v>

548
00:25:16.301 --> 00:25:16.301
<v Speaker 6>to go to work,</v>

549
00:25:16.301 --> 00:25:16.350
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>

550
00:25:16.890 --> 00:25:19.720
<v Speaker 5>it's human nail is this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what I'm talking about?</v>

551
00:25:20.050 --> 00:25:22.630
<v Speaker 5>Human nail and I was just playing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Come on.</v>

552
00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:28.530
<v Speaker 5>How could that be possible?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because someone else was in this box.</v>

553
00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:34.440
<v Speaker 5>That's a human taste.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It.</v>

554
00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:38.820
<v Speaker 5>Taste it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's on that box.</v>

555
00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:39.850
<v Speaker 5>It's right on the box.</v>

556
00:25:40.910 --> 00:25:43.370
<v Speaker 6>Hello?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Missing.</v>

557
00:25:44.150 --> 00:25:48.270
<v Speaker 6>How could it be?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's probably who.</v>

558
00:25:48.271 --> 00:25:49.170
<v Speaker 6>Wait.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who was here last?</v>

559
00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.830
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's probably Duncan's Clinton.</v>

560
00:25:53.030 --> 00:25:54.780
<v Speaker 6>Trump does nails.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you imagine if you.</v>

561
00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.520
<v Speaker 6>Do you want a podcast with someone who </v>
<v Speaker 6>watched them,</v>

562
00:25:56.521 --> 00:25:58.650
<v Speaker 6>trim them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How's you're doing as you're doing it,</v>

563
00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:03.660
<v Speaker 6>be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck are you doing with those </v>

564
00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:03.660
<v Speaker 6>gross thing?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It would be over somewhere in this area.</v>

565
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:06.360
<v Speaker 6>Scanning the rest of the table.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

566
00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:08.330
<v Speaker 6>I'm trying to find that one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm hoping there's not a whole.</v>

567
00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:12.180
<v Speaker 6>The US who smokes joints with random </v>
<v Speaker 6>strangers.</v>

568
00:26:12.810 --> 00:26:17.560
<v Speaker 6>Who knows what kinds of fucking weird </v>
<v Speaker 6>fecal herpes you're passing around.</v>

569
00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:23.080
<v Speaker 6>I put a toenail in my friends bond once </v>
<v Speaker 6>and he hit it and it smells friend.</v>

570
00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.460
<v Speaker 6>You're an enemy posing as a friend.</v>

571
00:26:28.650 --> 00:26:31.190
<v Speaker 6>You're a terrible person.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It Burns.</v>

572
00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:34.480
<v Speaker 6>Smelled like hair.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So what was the experience like going to</v>

573
00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:37.270
<v Speaker 6>this club and doing it with just you and</v>
<v Speaker 6>Diaz?</v>

574
00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.860
<v Speaker 6>It was pretty cool,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but ds has a very strict no comp policy,</v>

575
00:26:41.250 --> 00:26:43.470
<v Speaker 6>so it was all just on fans,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which nice.</v>

576
00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:48.770
<v Speaker 6>But we didn't get like tons of like </v>
<v Speaker 6>those Asu chicks showing up wasn't as </v>

577
00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:48.770
<v Speaker 6>much of the party.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

578
00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:51.360
<v Speaker 6>So he has a no comms policy because you </v>
<v Speaker 6>guys get a door deal.</v>

579
00:26:51.361 --> 00:26:52.590
<v Speaker 6>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

580
00:26:52.591 --> 00:26:54.180
<v Speaker 6>And also he feels like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I agree a little bit,</v>

581
00:26:54.181 --> 00:26:57.180
<v Speaker 6>which just cheapens the ticket saying </v>
<v Speaker 6>you can get a ticket for free.</v>

582
00:26:57.181 --> 00:26:59.310
<v Speaker 6>It makes it thing like you can get that </v>
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>

583
00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:00.260
<v Speaker 6>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to see that.</v>

584
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:03.660
<v Speaker 6>It's a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I tell the clubs in New York and La,</v>

585
00:27:03.661 --> 00:27:04.170
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>listen,</v>

586
00:27:04.171 --> 00:27:09.171
<v Speaker 6>I'll retweet stuff when I'm on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I won't if it's saying half price </v>

587
00:27:09.171 --> 00:27:09.171
<v Speaker 6>tickets for free tickets to the Red </v>
<v Speaker 6>River,</v>

588
00:27:09.171 --> 00:27:09.171
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can't retweet those.</v>

589
00:27:09.171 --> 00:27:12.090
<v Speaker 6>You don't want to like keep saying this </v>
<v Speaker 6>free shit of mine.</v>

590
00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:13.500
<v Speaker 6>Well it's also the,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

591
00:27:13.501 --> 00:27:15.780
<v Speaker 6>the audience,</v>
<v Speaker 6>their attitude about the show.</v>

592
00:27:15.970 --> 00:27:20.970
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's one thing that Joe is pretty </v>

593
00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:20.970
<v Speaker 6>adamant about shows where people are </v>
<v Speaker 6>getting free tickets.</v>

594
00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:22.290
<v Speaker 6>They're not going to treat it with </v>
<v Speaker 6>respect.</v>

595
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:26.010
<v Speaker 6>That was the downfall of Miami.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The Miami probably tickets was.</v>

596
00:27:26.011 --> 00:27:28.050
<v Speaker 6>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That was drunk.</v>

597
00:27:28.051 --> 00:27:33.051
<v Speaker 6>Cubans were always there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That Miami Improv was the worst major </v>

598
00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:36.120
<v Speaker 6>players in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It doesn't exist anymore.</v>

599
00:27:36.121 --> 00:27:38.340
<v Speaker 6>It's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really gone.</v>

600
00:27:38.341 --> 00:27:40.320
<v Speaker 6>I heard it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The the local comics.</v>

601
00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:44.700
<v Speaker 6>It's like a little dance scene down </v>
<v Speaker 6>there in Miami now in south Florida.</v>

602
00:27:44.701 --> 00:27:46.410
<v Speaker 6>They have a little harm and turning that</v>
<v Speaker 6>gig down.</v>

603
00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.430
<v Speaker 6>I got hard.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

604
00:27:47.770 --> 00:27:48.150
<v Speaker 6>Do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

605
00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:49.060
<v Speaker 6>nope.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nope,</v>

606
00:27:49.061 --> 00:27:54.061
<v Speaker 6>nope.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's when I stopped doing like way </v>

607
00:27:54.061 --> 00:27:54.240
<v Speaker 6>long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>More than 10 years ago.</v>

608
00:27:54.330 --> 00:27:56.400
<v Speaker 6>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's no way I'm done.</v>

609
00:27:56.710 --> 00:27:58.680
<v Speaker 6>This is a last.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was saying it onstage.</v>

610
00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:01.020
<v Speaker 6>This is the last time would come in </v>
<v Speaker 6>here.</v>

611
00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:03.820
<v Speaker 6>Like there's no doubt this is the </v>
<v Speaker 6>dumbest club and wrong.</v>

612
00:28:04.020 --> 00:28:06.390
<v Speaker 6>Everything is shitty part of town.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

613
00:28:06.391 --> 00:28:09.900
<v Speaker 6>that's just the part of town was great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The problem is they started,</v>

614
00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:15.080
<v Speaker 6>they started giving away free tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Remember there was all this cool </v>

615
00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:15.480
<v Speaker 6>restaurants and outdoor cafes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

616
00:28:15.481 --> 00:28:16.920
<v Speaker 6>Right there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

617
00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:18.100
<v Speaker 6>That comedy club was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

618
00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:20.540
<v Speaker 6>They had the place where you get those </v>
<v Speaker 6>mixed drinks that the,</v>

619
00:28:20.541 --> 00:28:21.070
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the,</v>

620
00:28:21.230 --> 00:28:23.290
<v Speaker 6>the upfront.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yep.</v>

621
00:28:23.610 --> 00:28:24.720
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That wasn't bad.</v>

622
00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:29.820
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you go try to meet girls right across </v>

623
00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:29.820
<v Speaker 6>the way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When they were,</v>

624
00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:29.820
<v Speaker 6>they all poured out and went to that </v>
<v Speaker 6>bar.</v>

625
00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:30.230
<v Speaker 6>And then you were like a superstar.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

626
00:28:30.231 --> 00:28:32.310
<v Speaker 6>I remember there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Was that a cigar bar too?</v>

627
00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:35.160
<v Speaker 6>They had like a cigar place.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You could sit down a little cigar lounge</v>

628
00:28:35.161 --> 00:28:36.370
<v Speaker 6>and was ready to cry.</v>

629
00:28:36.390 --> 00:28:38.400
<v Speaker 6>It was not,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not a bad little mall area.</v>

630
00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:43.710
<v Speaker 6>The problem is that club had been </v>
<v Speaker 6>cultivated in like the worst possible </v>

631
00:28:43.710 --> 00:28:44.670
<v Speaker 6>way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like the guy who was there before Joel,</v>

632
00:28:44.770 --> 00:28:49.770
<v Speaker 6>there was all sorts of problems.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You'll manager try to quiet down at a </v>

633
00:28:49.770 --> 00:28:49.770
<v Speaker 6>table.</v>

637
00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:58.940
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they would try to stop a flood when it </v>

638
00:28:58.940 --> 00:28:58.940
<v Speaker 6>was already broken.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

639
00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:03.580
<v Speaker 6>Broken through.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're putting their finger in to hold </v>

640
00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:03.850
<v Speaker 6>back the dam with their hands.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've never been there.</v>

641

<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I brought up a boxer's name in a bit.</v>

642

<v Speaker 6>I forget what boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they started arguing over you.</v>

<v Speaker 6>like who's the best boxer ever?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 6>but can you please be quiet?</v>

649
00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:26.730
<v Speaker 6>Tables were yelling over at other </v>
<v Speaker 6>tables.</v>

650
00:29:26.731 --> 00:29:28.620
<v Speaker 6>They were like monkey.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They were like,</v>

651
00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:34.600
<v Speaker 6>they were crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There were the wildest audience I've </v>

652
00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:35.370
<v Speaker 6>ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'd never seen an audience and I think,</v>

653
00:29:35.371 --> 00:29:36.720
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you talked to them after the show,</v>

654
00:29:36.721 --> 00:29:39.270
<v Speaker 6>like coming in because I was kind of </v>
<v Speaker 6>curious about how this is possible.</v>

655
00:29:39.271 --> 00:29:42.250
<v Speaker 6>That one club could be so bad,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so bad behaved,</v>

656
00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.860
<v Speaker 6>and it was a lot of repeat customers.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of people,</v>

657
00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:46.330
<v Speaker 6>so they just knew that's how you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>supposed to.</v>

658
00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:49.330
<v Speaker 6>That's how it was there and that's just </v>
<v Speaker 6>what they did.</v>

659
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:52.030
<v Speaker 6>That's just how it was there and that's </v>
<v Speaker 6>what they did and so that's why they had</v>

660
00:29:52.031 --> 00:29:57.031
<v Speaker 6>a tank.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The place they had cultivated and you </v>

661
00:29:57.031 --> 00:29:58.150
<v Speaker 6>can't just let go the database because </v>
<v Speaker 6>you let go of the database.</v>

<v Speaker 6>You don't know what the effective with </v>

665
00:30:09.790 --> 00:30:11.320
<v Speaker 6>samples.</v>

666
00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:15.730
<v Speaker 6>I saw,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I saw dsp put people underwater there.</v>

667
00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:18.850
<v Speaker 6>Wouldn't that be one of the southern </v>
<v Speaker 6>Florida ones were the ones that hired to</v>

668
00:30:18.851 --> 00:30:23.851

694
00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:20.800
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Working the crowd the way does a very </v>

695
00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:21.520
<v Speaker 6>different kind of performance.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's very,</v>

696
00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.410
<v Speaker 6>very fun.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Very funny.</v>

697
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:25.970
<v Speaker 6>You just have to know a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 6>secrets that shit like certain people,</v>

698
00:31:25.971 --> 00:31:28.420
<v Speaker 6>like you got to do a couple minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>crowd work to start two minutes,</v>

699
00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:29.770
<v Speaker 6>then you can direct.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>

700
00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:31.000
<v Speaker 6>Once you know that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then you're fine.</v>

701
00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:36.330
<v Speaker 6>Certain people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just like there's certain ways to </v>

702
00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:36.330
<v Speaker 6>follow them.</v>

703
00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:36.330
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

704
00:31:36.330 --> 00:31:37.330
<v Speaker 6>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's that,</v>

705
00:31:37.331 --> 00:31:38.390
<v Speaker 6>but they also,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

706
00:31:38.410 --> 00:31:41.650
<v Speaker 6>there's other people that can kind of </v>
<v Speaker 6>like set the pace and slow them down and</v>

707
00:31:41.651 --> 00:31:44.100
<v Speaker 6>bring them into their world.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've seen guys do that too.</v>

708
00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:46.810
<v Speaker 6>Or the guy gets really riled and they </v>
<v Speaker 6>just don't get rattled.</v>

709
00:31:46.811 --> 00:31:50.620
<v Speaker 6>They just start from a neutral position </v>
<v Speaker 6>and then work it back in and then,</v>

710
00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:55.680
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>20 minutes in or whatever they're </v>

711
00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:55.680
<v Speaker 6>killing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're doing it their way to be able to</v>

712
00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:59.341
<v Speaker 6>pull the mic away from their face more </v>
<v Speaker 6>so it's quieter so people can't hear </v>

713
00:31:59.341 --> 00:32:01.360
<v Speaker 6>unless they quiet down themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a good move to I guess.</v>

714
00:32:01.750 --> 00:32:03.490
<v Speaker 6>But you got to have material to back </v>
<v Speaker 6>that up.</v>

715
00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:06.430
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like when you were going on after a</v>

716
00:32:06.431 --> 00:32:11.431
<v Speaker 6>guy who does crowd work,</v>
<v Speaker 6>are you going after a guy who does </v>

717
00:32:11.431 --> 00:32:12.910
<v Speaker 6>music?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Anything that's like different than just</v>

718
00:32:12.911 --> 00:32:14.750
<v Speaker 6>normal standup.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It sort of sets,</v>

719
00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:20.190
<v Speaker 6>sets the tempo.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like going to see like captain </v>

720
00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:23.401
<v Speaker 6>America want to see Captain America and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then you leave and it's an independent </v>

721
00:32:23.401 --> 00:32:26.770
<v Speaker 6>black and white film about a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 6>dealing with the fact that you know,</v>

722
00:32:27.070 --> 00:32:28.210
<v Speaker 6>childhood,</v>

<v Speaker 6>I feel like what the fuck is this?</v>

726
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:40.130
<v Speaker 6>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can be very</v>

727
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:43.760
<v Speaker 4>hard to get your minds to see captain </v>
<v Speaker 4>America has shitty wasn't it?</v>

728
00:32:43.761 --> 00:32:45.650
<v Speaker 4>Wasn't shitty because I like those </v>
<v Speaker 4>movies.</v>

<v Speaker 4>In the first one,</v>

731
00:32:49.910 --> 00:32:52.310
<v Speaker 4>the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first bad guy who steals a serum,</v>

732
00:32:52.430 --> 00:32:55.170
<v Speaker 4>he's got some kid with a gun to his head</v>
<v Speaker 4>and cut.</v>

733
00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:56.250
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>

734
00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:57.410
<v Speaker 4>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Take it easy.</v>

735
00:32:57.470 --> 00:32:58.370
<v Speaker 4>Don't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Rash.</v>

736
00:32:58.700 --> 00:32:59.660
<v Speaker 4>And the guy's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cool.</v>

737
00:32:59.750 --> 00:33:03.800
<v Speaker 4>And then he just throws the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just throws the kid and then runs,</v>

738
00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:09.250
<v Speaker 4>but he's still the kid in the water than</v>
<v Speaker 4>Captain America would have to save them </v>

739
00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:09.350
<v Speaker 4>or kill that kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Take them with you.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

760
00:33:55.541 --> 00:33:58.430
<v Speaker 4>It's waiting for the hug to just get mad</v>

<v Speaker 4>He doesn't.</v>

762
00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:04.160
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't even put on an outfit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody else is wearing their outfit.</v>

763
00:34:04.250 --> 00:34:06.200
<v Speaker 4>He's walking around with a fucking suit </v>
<v Speaker 4>and tie.</v>

764
00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:07.250

767
00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:16.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm not even going to wear like a suit </v>
<v Speaker 4>and pretend I'm going to turn into the </v>

768
00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:19.301
<v Speaker 4>hulk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he's the fucking avengers knows </v>

769
00:34:19.301 --> 00:34:19.580
<v Speaker 4>that he's out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that he's going to have to turn into the</v>

770
00:34:19.581 --> 00:34:21.740
<v Speaker 4>hulk and he still doesn't even put on a </v>
<v Speaker 4>suit.</v>

771
00:34:21.741 --> 00:34:22.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like if you have a friend who's a</v>

772
00:34:22.731 --> 00:34:27.731
<v Speaker 4>contractor and you're building a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>extension or health or would you not </v>

773
00:34:27.731 --> 00:34:31.061
<v Speaker 4>call it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What kind of Yoga Pants is that </v>

774
00:34:31.061 --> 00:34:31.061
<v Speaker 4>motherfucker wearing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He.</v>

775
00:34:31.061 --> 00:34:34.571
<v Speaker 4>They work on him when he is five foot 10</v>
<v Speaker 4>to 170 pounds and they also work on him </v>

776
00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:38.870
<v Speaker 4>when he is seven feet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five,</v>

777
00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:41.960
<v Speaker 4>250,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>pounds or whatever the hell.</v>

778
00:34:41.961 --> 00:34:43.200
<v Speaker 4>The hulk ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

779
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:47.150
<v Speaker 4>how is it possible that the same pants </v>
<v Speaker 4>work on both dudes?</v>

780
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:50.020
<v Speaker 4>I would say that in the early years that</v>
<v Speaker 4>was more problematic,</v>

781
00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:55.030
<v Speaker 4>but once it becomes part of the avengers</v>
<v Speaker 4>that they would have had the technology </v>

782
00:34:55.030 --> 00:34:58.151
<v Speaker 4>to work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why wouldn't they fucking get him an </v>

783
00:34:58.151 --> 00:35:00.640
<v Speaker 4>outfit that he could change into and be </v>
<v Speaker 4>comfortable wearing this tiny man's </v>

784
00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:00.640
<v Speaker 4>pants?</v>

785
00:35:00.750 --> 00:35:03.250
<v Speaker 4>Like they don't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're wearing a dress.</v>

786
00:35:03.490 --> 00:35:07.460
<v Speaker 4>Let's see the hog transformation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's pull up the whole transformation.</v>

787
00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:11.540
<v Speaker 4>Let's break down how ridiculous this is </v>
<v Speaker 4>because if you look at the difference in</v>

788
00:35:11.541 --> 00:35:16.541
<v Speaker 4>size,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're dealing with a person that's </v>

789
00:35:16.541 --> 00:35:18.791
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would love to see a scale models next </v>

790
00:35:18.791 --> 00:35:18.791
<v Speaker 4>to each other to see how those pants </v>
<v Speaker 4>could take.</v>

791
00:35:18.791 --> 00:35:20.060
<v Speaker 4>How many times bigger as he.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it 10?</v>

792
00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:21.850
<v Speaker 4>Like is he like 10 times bigger?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

793
00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:23.720
<v Speaker 4>He could fit in this room,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

794
00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:27.050
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Couldn't even fit in this room no bigger</v>

795
00:35:27.051 --> 00:35:27.750
<v Speaker 4>than a house.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

796
00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:30.860
<v Speaker 4>He's way bigger than this room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'd be size of like a tank.</v>

797
00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:33.260
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever see.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever see when he grabs the,</v>

798
00:35:33.261 --> 00:35:35.000

802
00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:41.520

00:35:45.271 --> 00:35:50.271
<v Speaker 2>See the original one on television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which Lou Ferrigno saying that guy </v>

807
00:35:50.271 --> 00:35:51.990
<v Speaker 2>would've been like size of more than a </v>
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>

808
00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:55.950
<v Speaker 2>Right up to his knee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Lou Ferrigno is a giant guy.</v>

809
00:35:55.951 --> 00:35:57.600
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he was a human.</v>

810
00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:00.300
<v Speaker 2>Like when you see in Lou Ferrigno here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do all this stuff.</v>

811
00:36:00.570 --> 00:36:03.000
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's awesome.</v>

812
00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:04.890
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's obviously huge.</v>

813
00:36:04.891 --> 00:36:07.990
<v Speaker 2>He's a giant guy through that bag of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking coconuts at that there,</v>

814
00:36:08.450 --> 00:36:10.060
<v Speaker 2>but there's a giant difference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which.</v>

815
00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:10.490
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

816
00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:13.200
<v Speaker 2>so now he's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he's the same size tank.</v>

817
00:36:14.110 --> 00:36:15.860
<v Speaker 2>You should burst through tax breaks.</v>

818
00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:23.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there'd be no room for the displacement </v>

819
00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:23.660
<v Speaker 2>of water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

820
00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.500
<v Speaker 2>Would change radically overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But look at the size of them.</v>

821
00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:28.470
<v Speaker 2>Look how much bigger that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And his fucking pants still fit.</v>

822
00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:32.070
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now here's the Edward Norton did it?</v>

823
00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:37.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You didn't know Ed Norton was the hug </v>

824
00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:37.520
<v Speaker 2>was one of the better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked him.</v>

825
00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.240
<v Speaker 2>Apparently he didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't want to do it.</v>

826
00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.320
<v Speaker 2>He's an actor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's a really good actor.</v>

827
00:36:43.321 --> 00:36:48.321
<v Speaker 2>I think he was worried about getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>lumped into this thing and becoming the </v>

828
00:36:48.321 --> 00:36:48.321
<v Speaker 2>hulk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>So Cgi afterwards.</v>

830
00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:54.780
<v Speaker 2>Good acting there.</v>

<v Speaker 2>She wasn't going to do this.</v>

832
00:36:59.011 --> 00:37:01.890
<v Speaker 2>No one even there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She should have said something already.</v>

833
00:37:01.950 --> 00:37:03.990
<v Speaker 2>She's doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the best though.</v>

<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

839
00:37:20.510 --> 00:37:21.320
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to see him.</v>

840
00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:23.240
<v Speaker 2>You got to see better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Better images of him.</v>

841
00:37:23.241 --> 00:37:27.080
<v Speaker 2>He's bigger than two cars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's gigantic.</v>

842
00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.090
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't one of them where he got </v>
<v Speaker 2>bigger.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You get even bigger.</v>

846
00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:37.390

<v Speaker 2>envy with him or not?</v>

847
00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:42.400
<v Speaker 2>It just happened to be green.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just I think it was a gamma ray thing </v>

848
00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:45.350
<v Speaker 2>because the whole idea was that he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>created in an accident with gamma rays.</v>

849
00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:50.470

851
00:37:53.021 --> 00:37:54.881

<v Speaker 7>That's a guy.</v>

929
00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.830
<v Speaker 7>David Lloyd that employs a guy right </v>
<v Speaker 7>there.</v>

930

<v Speaker 7>So they were all holding.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think that's a weeds or hair </v>

932
00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:51.900
<v Speaker 7>that's right here.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's why it's so effective.</v>

933
00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:55.910
<v Speaker 7>And when it gets a nappy weaves.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So what was this?</v>

934
00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:57.960
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even get that order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

935
00:41:57.961 --> 00:41:59.800
<v Speaker 3>I heard two stories.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One inch.</v>

936
00:41:59.910 --> 00:42:04.910
<v Speaker 3>One this a woman wanted a refund and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then that's what the restaurant is </v>

937
00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:09.030
<v Speaker 3>saying is that the woman tried to take a</v>
<v Speaker 3>beer out off the property and you're not</v>

938
00:42:09.031 --> 00:42:12.300
<v Speaker 3>allowed to take a beer outside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could only drink the beer inside the</v>

939
00:42:12.301 --> 00:42:15.660
<v Speaker 3>place because it's illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that manager just went crazy.</v>

940
00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:17.850
<v Speaker 3>They fired the manager up at this </v>
<v Speaker 3>restaurant.</v>

941
00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:22.880
<v Speaker 3>I guess they're a supposedly like people</v>
<v Speaker 3>are picketing this restaurant and we </v>

942
00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:27.711

00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:03.300
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wouldn't be the hardest one to kill,</v>

1039
00:46:03.301 --> 00:46:03.540
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1040
00:46:03.830 --> 00:46:08.830
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I by a sheep kill Jay Hahn ranch on the </v>

1041
00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:08.830
<v Speaker 6>way to San Jose.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

1042
00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:08.960
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1043
00:46:08.970 --> 00:46:10.560
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's so big.</v>

1044
00:46:10.561 --> 00:46:12.120
<v Speaker 6>It's 2 million,</v>
<v Speaker 6>700,000</v>

1045
00:46:12.121 --> 00:46:12.800
<v Speaker 6>acres.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean you're like,</v>

1046
00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:17.820
<v Speaker 6>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's that ranch and then like 20 </v>

1047
00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:17.820
<v Speaker 6>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then you're like,</v>

1048
00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:17.820
<v Speaker 6>what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're still passing that ranch.</v>

1049
00:46:17.820 --> 00:46:21.800
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's the biggest ranch in all of </v>

1050
00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:21.800
<v Speaker 6>California.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

1051
00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:21.800
<v Speaker 6>This giant.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And we're going there and we're going to</v>

1052
00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:23.140
<v Speaker 6>shoot some pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1053
00:46:23.310 --> 00:46:25.590
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're going to schedule that soon.</v>

1054
00:46:25.950 --> 00:46:27.300
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking fun.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm leaving.</v>

1055
00:46:27.301 --> 00:46:28.800
<v Speaker 6>I'm going back to New York soon.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Son.</v>

1056
00:46:28.801 --> 00:46:31.530
<v Speaker 6>Why would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just because it's warm there in April.</v>

1057
00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:35.420
<v Speaker 6>He's a smart fella.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're doing what a lot of old people do</v>

1058
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:37.080
<v Speaker 6>in Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess so.</v>

1059
00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:39.960
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think that's such a great move.</v>

1060
00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:45.140
<v Speaker 6>Isn't it nice to have the financial </v>
<v Speaker 6>freedom to just travel around and do </v>

1061
00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:45.140
<v Speaker 6>whatever you want?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1062
00:46:45.140 --> 00:46:48.600
<v Speaker 6>Bro.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's the fucking nice civic.</v>

1063
00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:50.950
<v Speaker 6>Still got the bulletproof stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 6>soon.</v>

1064
00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:53.970
<v Speaker 6>That thing will never die.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ever even had a problem with that car.</v>

1065
00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:55.230
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Those things are.</v>

1066
00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:59.900
<v Speaker 6>God Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've never had their masterpieces.</v>

1067
00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:03.360
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's still got like manual </v>
<v Speaker 6>windows and stuff.</v>

1068
00:47:03.450 --> 00:47:05.100
<v Speaker 6>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Manual transmission too,</v>

1069
00:47:05.101 --> 00:47:05.490
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1070
00:47:05.491 --> 00:47:07.360
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't care about that but the thing is</v>

1071
00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:09.520
<v Speaker 6>it's got a CD player do it for a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 6>people.</v>

1072
00:47:09.570 --> 00:47:11.160
<v Speaker 6>Manual transmissions,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a deal breaker,</v>

1073
00:47:11.190 --> 00:47:13.350
<v Speaker 6>stuck in traffic,</v>
<v Speaker 6>having to use the clutch.</v>

1074
00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:13.950
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>nevermind that.</v>

1075
00:47:13.951 --> 00:47:17.910
<v Speaker 6>It's only hard when you're trying to </v>
<v Speaker 6>like repack a bowl or something.</v>

1076
00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:21.030
<v Speaker 6>Text.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When I drive,</v>

1077
00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:24.120
<v Speaker 6>if I drive like a and I know I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 6>to be on the four or five,</v>

1078
00:47:24.121 --> 00:47:29.121
<v Speaker 6>I never take the porsche just because </v>
<v Speaker 6>the manual transmission that's going to </v>

1079
00:47:29.121 --> 00:47:29.121
<v Speaker 6>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1080
00:47:29.121 --> 00:47:30.480
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And my manual transmission</v>

1081
00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:34.150
<v Speaker 2>is a tricky one to drive because it has </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's called a single mass flywheel,</v>

1082
00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:36.250
<v Speaker 2>which means the ribs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a race car.</v>

1083
00:47:36.251 --> 00:47:39.760
<v Speaker 2>The rose gold and they drop really quick</v>
<v Speaker 2>too,</v>

1084
00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:45.120
<v Speaker 2>so they rise up and then they fall </v>
<v Speaker 2>really quick too because of the fly </v>

1085
00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:45.120
<v Speaker 2>wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1086
00:47:45.120 --> 00:47:48.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes it harder for speed.</v>

1087
00:47:49.240 --> 00:47:54.240
<v Speaker 2>The ability to shift gears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just it's a lighter flywheel but because</v>

1088
00:47:56.740 --> 00:47:58.780
<v Speaker 2>it's all about saving weight and cars </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1089
00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:04.080
<v Speaker 2>But when you're at a red light it's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>real problem because he wants to drop </v>

1090
00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:07.321
<v Speaker 2>off real quick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have to be really much more </v>

1091
00:48:07.321 --> 00:48:07.321
<v Speaker 2>careful with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1092
00:48:07.321 --> 00:48:08.040
<v Speaker 2>you'll stall out A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1093
00:48:08.090 --> 00:48:11.530
<v Speaker 2>Hills are bad too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you've got to fall back into people.</v>

1094
00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:16.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that last one hill and it hits </v>

1095
00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:16.620
<v Speaker 2>sunset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've cooked many a clutch on that hill.</v>

1096
00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:17.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm always like,</v>

1097
00:48:17.550 --> 00:48:19.420
<v Speaker 2>take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like back back.</v>

1098
00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:20.310
<v Speaker 2>Stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1099
00:48:20.311 --> 00:48:21.850
<v Speaker 2>you worked the e-brake too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1100
00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:26.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a real big fuck up that Porsche </v>

1101
00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:26.900
<v Speaker 2>did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Portia,</v>

1102
00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:29.320
<v Speaker 2>did they have a button e-brake now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you dummies that's needed.</v>

1103
00:48:29.330 --> 00:48:34.330
<v Speaker 2>That mistake that the manipulating the </v>
<v Speaker 2>brake with your hand was everything </v>

1104
00:48:34.330 --> 00:48:34.870
<v Speaker 2>that's on hills when you're parking is </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to pick that.</v>

1105
00:48:34.871 --> 00:48:37.410
<v Speaker 2>Put that on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they just have a button electronic.</v>

1106
00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:42.580
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the modular might be able to </v>

1107
00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:42.580
<v Speaker 2>modulate it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1108
00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:44.560
<v Speaker 2>being able to like pull a little bit and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then let go as you started.</v>

1109
00:48:45.490 --> 00:48:50.490
<v Speaker 2>I love doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had before that I had an old Toyota </v>

1110
00:48:50.490 --> 00:48:51.910
<v Speaker 2>and it was automatic and I will go up </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hill on sweetzer and when I'm at the</v>

1111
00:48:51.911 --> 00:48:55.090
<v Speaker 2>light I let go of the brake and put the </v>
<v Speaker 2>accelerator and it was just stand still.</v>

1112
00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:57.620
<v Speaker 2>We just couldn't go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1113
00:48:57.690 --> 00:48:59.210
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't have the power and I feel like</v>

1114
00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:01.010
<v Speaker 2>jettison shit or just turn around.</v>

1115
00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:04.030
<v Speaker 2>My car has to fly wheels or something </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1116
00:49:04.031 --> 00:49:07.470
<v Speaker 2>So like if it's on a hill it just </v>
<v Speaker 2>automatically kicks in the other fly.</v>

1117
00:49:07.550 --> 00:49:09.940
<v Speaker 2>So then when you let go of the brake it </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't move.</v>

1118
00:49:10.030 --> 00:49:12.070
<v Speaker 2>And then you just hit the gas and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>go straight up.</v>

1119
00:49:12.130 --> 00:49:17.130
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make sense though because </v>

1120
00:49:17.130 --> 00:49:17.130
<v Speaker 2>it's an automatic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have an automatic.</v>

1121
00:49:17.130 --> 00:49:18.580
<v Speaker 2>So it's whatever it is you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

1122
00:49:18.581 --> 00:49:23.581
<v Speaker 2>It's probably a different mechanism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably something to do with the </v>

1123
00:49:23.581 --> 00:49:23.581
<v Speaker 2>transmission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably a dual clutch transmission</v>

1124
00:49:23.581 --> 00:49:23.950
<v Speaker 2>clutch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

1125
00:49:24.670 --> 00:49:25.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

1126
00:49:25.610 --> 00:49:28.710
<v Speaker 2>a lot of the modern automatic cars or </v>
<v Speaker 2>dual clutch now,</v>

1127
00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:30.480
<v Speaker 2>which that means is also that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1128
00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:33.610
<v Speaker 2>the shift gears and insane amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>time real,</v>

1129
00:49:33.611 --> 00:49:34.480
<v Speaker 2>real fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1130
00:49:34.540 --> 00:49:36.290
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like in the Porsche's,</v>

1131
00:49:36.500 --> 00:49:39.400
<v Speaker 2>like the gt three,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it does it in like less than 100</v>

1132
00:49:39.401 --> 00:49:40.500
<v Speaker 2>milliseconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

1133
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:46.060
<v Speaker 2>They didn't change it manually.</v>

1134
00:49:46.180 --> 00:49:46.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1135
00:49:46.751 --> 00:49:50.410
<v Speaker 2>way faster than they think that every </v>
<v Speaker 2>shift of gear,</v>

1136
00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:55.440
<v Speaker 2>like in a race is worth three quarters </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a car shift between a manual gearbox </v>

1137
00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:58.600
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these double clutch boxes,</v>

1138
00:49:58.750 --> 00:50:02.560
<v Speaker 2>meaning that if they're both going along</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same speed in the same pace,</v>

1139
00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:07.740
<v Speaker 2>but one had to shift gears,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one that didn't have to take any </v>

1140
00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:09.550
<v Speaker 2>time to shift the gears would get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>three quarter car length advantage.</v>

1141
00:50:09.580 --> 00:50:10.700
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1142
00:50:10.710 --> 00:50:13.250
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No over shift.</v>

1143
00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:14.380
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1144
00:50:14.650 --> 00:50:15.830
<v Speaker 2>per shift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1145
00:50:16.030 --> 00:50:20.290
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you don't have to,</v>

1146
00:50:20.291 --> 00:50:22.660
<v Speaker 2>there's no the off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of that.</v>

1147
00:50:22.840 --> 00:50:25.600
<v Speaker 2>It's instantaneous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's fun driving a stick shift.</v>

1148
00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:26.830
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the problem.</v>

1149
00:50:27.170 --> 00:50:28.070
<v Speaker 2>The problem is like what</v>

1150
00:50:28.070 --> 00:50:30.800
<v Speaker 6>do you do in trying to race everywhere </v>
<v Speaker 6>on those hills?</v>

1151
00:50:30.801 --> 00:50:33.590
<v Speaker 6>Up in the mountains though when you were</v>
<v Speaker 6>like going uphill for like five miles,</v>

1152
00:50:33.890 --> 00:50:35.770
<v Speaker 6>you just lowered the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1153
00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:38.030
<v Speaker 6>gear you're in pickup.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1154
00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:41.090
<v Speaker 6>I don't mind it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Especially the Porsche.</v>

1155
00:50:41.091 --> 00:50:43.440
<v Speaker 6>That thing is a ride.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you can't do that.</v>

1156
00:50:44.040 --> 00:50:45.740
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't feel as good.</v>

1157
00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:48.290
<v Speaker 6>Like I have an automatic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My bmws and automatic.</v>

1158
00:50:48.291 --> 00:50:49.310
<v Speaker 6>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's a double clutch.</v>

1159
00:50:49.311 --> 00:50:54.311
<v Speaker 6>Automatic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you can do it with a paddle shifts </v>

1160
00:50:54.311 --> 00:50:54.311
<v Speaker 6>if you want,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but most of the time I don't.</v>

1161
00:50:54.311 --> 00:50:56.930
<v Speaker 6>I just drive it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The problem is that's an old style thing</v>

1162
00:50:56.931 --> 00:51:01.931
<v Speaker 6>that somehow sometimes more fun.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My aunt got this car and she got </v>

1163
00:51:01.931 --> 00:51:02.030
<v Speaker 6>automatics.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like lexus or something,</v>

1164
00:51:02.031 --> 00:51:04.430
<v Speaker 6>but it had instead of a clock to being </v>
<v Speaker 6>digital,</v>

1165
00:51:04.431 --> 00:51:06.710
<v Speaker 6>it was analog.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was like,</v>

1166
00:51:06.860 --> 00:51:08.960
<v Speaker 6>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just going to take the extra time.</v>

1167
00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:13.960
<v Speaker 6>That's a fancy car,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you're going to get your eyes off </v>

1168
00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:14.810
<v Speaker 6>the road for longer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I just trying to decipher that.</v>

1169
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:17.060
<v Speaker 6>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like this is a bad idea.</v>

1170
00:51:17.061 --> 00:51:19.580
<v Speaker 6>It's terrible idea.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Digital Id.</v>

1171
00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:21.110
<v Speaker 6>Digital clocks never became classy </v>
<v Speaker 6>though.</v>

1172
00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:22.460
<v Speaker 6>Never became closing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>

1173
00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:27.480
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Think about all these like really super </v>

1174
00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:27.650
<v Speaker 6>expensive watches that everybody wears </v>
<v Speaker 6>number digital analog for awhile.</v>

1175
00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:33.010
<v Speaker 6>Digital.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was just like it was a picture of </v>

1176
00:51:33.010 --> 00:51:33.010
<v Speaker 6>the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The hands moving.</v>

1177
00:51:33.010 --> 00:51:33.010
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>those are crappy watches.</v>

1178
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:38.190
<v Speaker 6>You don't remember that Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have this online to those new Samsung </v>

1179
00:51:38.190 --> 00:51:41.141
<v Speaker 6>watches and like the Iwatch type shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They have like the fake front where you </v>

1180
00:51:41.141 --> 00:51:42.560
<v Speaker 6>could just download new faces here.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh really?</v>

1181
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:47.950
<v Speaker 6>So it looked like whatever you want to </v>
<v Speaker 6>actually kind of cool though because </v>

1182
00:51:47.950 --> 00:51:50.381
<v Speaker 6>it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's almost like a little computer in </v>

1183
00:51:50.381 --> 00:51:50.420
<v Speaker 6>there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm attempted to get that Samsung one,</v>

1184
00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:51.720
<v Speaker 6>which was the new one.</v>

1185
00:51:51.790 --> 00:51:54.430
<v Speaker 6>New One.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Phone monitors your heart rate watch.</v>

1186
00:51:55.730 --> 00:52:00.730
<v Speaker 6>They also have a small one where it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>just like a kind of looks like the fit </v>

1187
00:52:00.730 --> 00:52:04.331
<v Speaker 6>band,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like a thinner one that also does like </v>

1188
00:52:04.331 --> 00:52:07.270
<v Speaker 6>the heart rate and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Doesn't have a camera on then what you </v>

1189
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:07.270
<v Speaker 6>call yourself after your workout.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fitband,</v>

1190
00:52:08.170 --> 00:52:13.170
<v Speaker 6>you know they have a new galaxy s five.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's out now that has a heart rate </v>

1191
00:52:13.170 --> 00:52:14.120
<v Speaker 6>monitor on it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>On the phone.</v>

1192
00:52:14.121 --> 00:52:14.840
<v Speaker 6>The phone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What?</v>

1193
00:52:15.010 --> 00:52:16.400
<v Speaker 6>What did you just put it at a wrist?</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

1194
00:52:16.401 --> 00:52:19.130
<v Speaker 6>you touch it and hold onto it and it </v>
<v Speaker 6>monitors your heart rate.</v>

1195
00:52:19.250 --> 00:52:21.020
<v Speaker 6>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I could never use it.</v>

1196
00:52:21.021 --> 00:52:23.600
<v Speaker 6>I use it at the gym over in between </v>
<v Speaker 6>workouts.</v>

1197
00:52:23.601 --> 00:52:28.601
<v Speaker 6>Like say if you do like do some,</v>
<v Speaker 6>some fucking crazy kettlebell workout </v>

1198
00:52:28.601 --> 00:52:32.680
<v Speaker 6>and then you grabbed this thing when </v>
<v Speaker 6>your heart drops to a certain rate and </v>

1199
00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:32.680
<v Speaker 6>then you go again.</v>

1200
00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:32.680
<v Speaker 6>Oh Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1201
00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:37.241
<v Speaker 6>And it works with fit software.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They have software that's built in to </v>

1202
00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:41.430
<v Speaker 6>sure how drunk you are.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 6>June 14th.</v>

1209
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:57.990

<v Speaker 6>It's very perfect crystal clear image.</v>

1218
00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:26.040
<v Speaker 6>It's just so</v>

1219
00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:26.940
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>

1220
00:53:26.941 --> 00:53:31.941
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just can't believe that it took them </v>

1221
00:53:31.941 --> 00:53:33.981
<v Speaker 2>long enough to realize that that fits </v>
<v Speaker 2>easily in your back pocket and the </v>

1222
00:53:33.981 --> 00:53:35.970
<v Speaker 2>experience of going online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The experience of looking at pictures,</v>

1223
00:53:35.971 --> 00:53:40.971
<v Speaker 2>the experience of taking pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the experience of reading tweets and </v>

1224
00:53:40.971 --> 00:53:41.580
<v Speaker 2>then going to websites like someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>sends you a website,</v>

1225
00:53:41.850 --> 00:53:46.850
<v Speaker 2>it's infinitely better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you could actually go to a website </v>

1226
00:53:46.850 --> 00:53:49.850
<v Speaker 2>and get a good web experience from one </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the brilliant things or it doesn't </v>

1227
00:53:49.850 --> 00:53:50.490
<v Speaker 2>even have to be that big.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the galaxy.</v>

1228
00:53:50.670 --> 00:53:55.670
<v Speaker 2>It's five point one inches.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is like five point nine or </v>

1229
00:53:55.670 --> 00:53:56.190
<v Speaker 2>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The galaxy is five point one.</v>

1230
00:53:56.490 --> 00:53:56.940
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

1231
00:53:57.470 --> 00:53:58.520
<v Speaker 4>how much is this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The new one?</v>

1232
00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:02.110
<v Speaker 4>I think they're all pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pretty similar points.</v>

1233
00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:03.740
<v Speaker 4>I'll buy that new iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1234
00:54:03.741 --> 00:54:05.000
<v Speaker 4>the old one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much?</v>

1235
00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:06.740
<v Speaker 4>How big.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1236
00:54:06.741 --> 00:54:08.390
<v Speaker 4>it's tiny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's four inches.</v>

1237
00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:11.420
<v Speaker 4>I used to do fucking stuff on the old </v>
<v Speaker 4>envy.</v>

1238
00:54:11.810 --> 00:54:15.310
<v Speaker 4>Try to surf websites over that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Difficult before they even had.</v>

1239
00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:18.170
<v Speaker 4>It was the one that popped up and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>had a little keyboard.</v>

1240
00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:22.160
<v Speaker 4>Isn't it crazy that that seems like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>100 million years ago.</v>

1241
00:54:22.190 --> 00:54:24.740
<v Speaker 4>There were no mobile sites still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you could get on their sites,</v>

1242
00:54:24.830 --> 00:54:25.400
<v Speaker 4>but how much</v>

1243
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:29.360
<v Speaker 2>different have some inventions been in </v>
<v Speaker 2>that time?</v>

1244
00:54:29.361 --> 00:54:32.240
<v Speaker 2>Like how much?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like cars are pretty much recognizable.</v>

1245
00:54:32.241 --> 00:54:34.150
<v Speaker 2>Exactly the same back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost exactly the same.</v>

1246
00:54:34.151 --> 00:54:39.151
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that much difference until I breaks </v>

1247
00:54:39.151 --> 00:54:40.961
<v Speaker 2>with a before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they look a little slicker on the </v>

1248
00:54:40.961 --> 00:54:40.961
<v Speaker 2>outside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the new Mercedes is like.</v>

1249
00:54:41.310 --> 00:54:44.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But other than that you recognize it.</v>

1250
00:54:44.181 --> 00:54:47.720
<v Speaker 2>If you could go back in time 10 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>and get into a car,</v>

1251
00:54:47.721 --> 00:54:48.530
<v Speaker 2>you'd be fine.</v>

1252
00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:50.680
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even have a phone 10 years ago.</v>

1253
00:54:51.070 --> 00:54:52.120
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cell phone?</v>

1254
00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:54.040
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was late anyway.</v>

1255
00:54:54.110 --> 00:54:54.910
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1256
00:54:55.090 --> 00:54:57.580
<v Speaker 4>And we're in 2004.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't have one.</v>

1257
00:54:57.581 --> 00:54:58.330
<v Speaker 4>Get out of here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bitch.</v>

1258
00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:02.020
<v Speaker 4>You're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one ever lived in that place.</v>

1259
00:55:02.021 --> 00:55:03.760
<v Speaker 4>I didn't have one for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When did you get one?</v>

1260
00:55:03.761 --> 00:55:06.610
<v Speaker 4>What year?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two thousand five.</v>

1261
00:55:06.611 --> 00:55:08.470
<v Speaker 4>Two thousand six when we go on the road </v>
<v Speaker 4>together,</v>

1262
00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:11.170
<v Speaker 4>but not always like God will eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I found one.</v>

1263
00:55:11.171 --> 00:55:16.171
<v Speaker 4>I found a prepaid one in New York one </v>
<v Speaker 4>time when I was visiting and so I used </v>

1264
00:55:16.171 --> 00:55:17.950
<v Speaker 4>that for awhile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I sat by it for about an hour waiting to</v>

1265
00:55:17.951 --> 00:55:19.540
<v Speaker 4>see if somebody comes back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll claim it.</v>

1266
00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:22.220
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise you don't have to use a phone </v>
<v Speaker 4>for the whole week.</v>

1267
00:55:22.221 --> 00:55:22.750
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1268
00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:24.790
<v Speaker 4>this is actually nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's better than a pager.</v>

1269
00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:30.300
<v Speaker 4>It's way better than a page or dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was 2004 really old Nokia with snake </v>

1270
00:55:32.321 --> 00:55:35.650
<v Speaker 4>and that snake snake was good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>

00:55:35.830 --> 00:55:38.740
<v Speaker 4>I had a star Tac.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember those are tech.</v>

1272

<v Speaker 4>Of course he does.</v>

1276
00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:51.120
<v Speaker 4>He has an iphone too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he doesn't use that as much.</v>

1277
00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:53.520
<v Speaker 4>He enjoys being an old man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1278
00:55:53.890 --> 00:55:55.500
<v Speaker 4>I had one of these.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's see,</v>

1279
00:55:55.510 --> 00:55:59.330
<v Speaker 4>image that looks like or people who </v>
<v Speaker 4>worked.</v>

00:55:59.950 --> 00:56:00.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1281
00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:03.400
<v Speaker 2>I have one of those and it had an extra </v>
<v Speaker 2>battery,</v>

1282
00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:04.750
<v Speaker 2>like the battery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like stuck,</v>

1283
00:56:04.810 --> 00:56:06.900
<v Speaker 2>stuck out on the top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll see.</v>

1284
00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:08.590
<v Speaker 2>Look how easy the batteries were to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>

1285
00:56:08.680 --> 00:56:13.680
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You were pissed about that when the </v>

1286
00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:13.680
<v Speaker 2>iphones came out and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on man.</v>

1287
00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:13.680
<v Speaker 2>Give you the option.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1288
00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:14.320
<v Speaker 2>stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the other thing I like about</v>

1289
00:56:14.321 --> 00:56:15.370
<v Speaker 2>this phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Samsung,</v>

1290
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:20.670
<v Speaker 2>I have an extra battery that I keep with</v>
<v Speaker 2>me that it's fully charged and this </v>

1291
00:56:20.670 --> 00:56:23.761
<v Speaker 2>fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll go for a day and a half and any </v>

1292
00:56:23.761 --> 00:56:23.980
<v Speaker 2>point in time I popped the off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put the new</v>

1293
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:24.880
<v Speaker 6>battery.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Boom.</v>

1294
00:56:24.940 --> 00:56:26.030
<v Speaker 6>It's fully charged.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>

1295
00:56:26.110 --> 00:56:27.930
<v Speaker 6>What does that the note.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But guess the notes.</v>

1296

<v Speaker 6>Three notes through.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1297
00:56:29.470 --> 00:56:34.470
<v Speaker 6>And on top of that man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I sound like I'm in a no commercial and </v>

1298
00:56:34.470 --> 00:56:34.880
<v Speaker 6>then having a note for.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1299
00:56:35.160 --> 00:56:37.790
<v Speaker 6>they're going to work on right now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just know.</v>

1300
00:56:37.950 --> 00:56:38.260
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>

1301
00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:40.480
<v Speaker 6>this one's fairly recent,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the,</v>

1302
00:56:40.481 --> 00:56:45.481
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the other thing that's super cool is </v>

1303
00:56:45.481 --> 00:56:45.940
<v Speaker 6>this,</v>
<v Speaker 6>my ideas,</v>

1304
00:56:45.941 --> 00:56:49.380
<v Speaker 6>my joke ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I actually write them like,</v>

1305
00:56:49.390 --> 00:56:51.400
<v Speaker 6>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whoa.</v>

1306
00:56:51.490 --> 00:56:54.880
<v Speaker 6>It's all a notepad.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So all of my ideas,</v>

1307
00:56:55.180 --> 00:56:58.750
<v Speaker 6>I actually write down like I don't need </v>
<v Speaker 6>to carry a notebook anymore.</v>

1308
00:56:58.990 --> 00:57:03.990
<v Speaker 6>Like my notebook now.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like my actual physical handwriting </v>

1309
00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:05.000
<v Speaker 6>hurted so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's that?</v>

1310
00:57:05.050 --> 00:57:08.670
<v Speaker 6>Her Tattoo is so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Frosty asked me that and he goes,</v>

1311
00:57:08.710 --> 00:57:09.730
<v Speaker 6>what did you just write down?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

1312
00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:10.470
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>

1313
00:57:10.530 --> 00:57:11.140
<v Speaker 6>what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>

1314
00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:15.760
<v Speaker 6>it's not a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's just almond shaped nipples to write</v>

1315
00:57:15.761 --> 00:57:17.080
<v Speaker 6>that down because I might get back to </v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

1316
00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:18.490
<v Speaker 6>You never know.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

1317
00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:22.570
<v Speaker 6>I'm just.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's so funny that you said that.</v>

1318
00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:26.350
<v Speaker 6>I'll tell you why later.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I won't remember.</v>

1319
00:57:26.530 --> 00:57:29.350
<v Speaker 6>I have a thing about almond milk over.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like it's one of the,</v>

1320
00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:32.050
<v Speaker 6>one of the punchlines is that humans </v>
<v Speaker 6>don't have tits stupid.</v>

1321
00:57:32.051 --> 00:57:35.140
<v Speaker 6>You can't get milk out of an almond.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like don't call it milk.</v>

1322
00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:38.500
<v Speaker 6>Like almond milk,</v>
<v Speaker 6>almond milk,</v>

1323
00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:43.800
<v Speaker 6>rice milk.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's Whitewater Weird fucking cup water </v>

1324
00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:45.010
<v Speaker 6>doesn't come from a nipple.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You fuckhead.</v>

1325
00:57:45.290 --> 00:57:46.870
<v Speaker 6>But that's like a whole bit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I did.</v>

1326
00:57:46.871 --> 00:57:48.460
<v Speaker 6>So when you said that almond shaped </v>
<v Speaker 6>nipples,</v>

1327
00:57:48.461 --> 00:57:53.461
<v Speaker 6>it's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He surprised part of the Vegan bit and </v>

1328
00:57:53.461 --> 00:57:53.461
<v Speaker 6>surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't rock an ipad like an,</v>

1329
00:57:53.461 --> 00:57:54.730
<v Speaker 6>like a small ipad.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is a small ipad.</v>

1330
00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:57.190
<v Speaker 6>I mean essentially it is.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't need dude,</v>

1331
00:57:57.191 --> 00:58:00.520
<v Speaker 6>when I go on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I oftentimes don't even touch my laptop.</v>

1332
00:58:00.820 --> 00:58:02.950
<v Speaker 6>I just fuck around with his phone the </v>
<v Speaker 6>whole weekend,</v>

1333
00:58:02.951 --> 00:58:05.800
<v Speaker 6>like answering emails and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 6>doing that work stuff.</v>

1334
00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:08.170
<v Speaker 6>That's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's the big one for me,</v>

1335
00:58:08.171 --> 00:58:09.010
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is this,</v>

1336
00:58:09.011 --> 00:58:14.011
<v Speaker 6>the big one for me is the set lists that</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can write my set list down to instead </v>

1337
00:58:14.011 --> 00:58:16.320
<v Speaker 6>of a piece of paper.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like having it in my pocket.</v>

1338
00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:18.640
<v Speaker 6>I do too,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I like this too.</v>

1339
00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:21.820
<v Speaker 6>This is also,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like it doesn't replace it totally.</v>

1340
00:58:21.821 --> 00:58:24.640
<v Speaker 6>I still carry a notebook everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That would have been a lot better when I</v>

1341
00:58:24.641 --> 00:58:29.641
<v Speaker 6>was using those,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but the thing I like is as I flipped </v>

1342
00:58:29.641 --> 00:58:29.641
<v Speaker 6>through to find the note that I want,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I see the old notes.</v>

1343
00:58:29.641 --> 00:58:32.950
<v Speaker 6>I'm like eventually it will come out on </v>
<v Speaker 6>stage because I keep seeing it.</v>

1344
00:58:32.951 --> 00:58:34.690
<v Speaker 6>When I was writing notes in evernote or </v>
<v Speaker 6>something,</v>

1345
00:58:34.691 --> 00:58:37.090
<v Speaker 6>I wouldn't see the old notes once I made</v>
<v Speaker 6>a point to go back to them.</v>

1346
00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:39.490
<v Speaker 6>Well my notebook.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a difference between my notebook</v>

1347
00:58:39.491 --> 00:58:42.760
<v Speaker 6>and this is I would say more of like my </v>
<v Speaker 6>idea book,</v>

1348
00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:48.030
<v Speaker 6>like this is where I'll throw ideas in </v>
<v Speaker 6>what I want to write them down and I'll </v>

1349
00:58:48.030 --> 00:58:50.470
<v Speaker 6>throw like set lists,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but like my notebook is more like what I</v>

1350
00:58:50.471 --> 00:58:51.910
<v Speaker 6>do before I go onstage.</v>

1351
00:58:51.970 --> 00:58:56.970
<v Speaker 6>One of the big ones is I write down all </v>
<v Speaker 6>the different shit that I want to talk </v>

1352
00:58:56.970 --> 00:58:56.970
<v Speaker 6>about,</v>
<v Speaker 6>make sure that I like,</v>

1353
00:58:56.970 --> 00:59:01.800
<v Speaker 6>that's how I remember and that's how I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it helps me like make sure that I don't </v>

1354
00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:06.451
<v Speaker 6>leave anything out to give me like all </v>
<v Speaker 6>these little points and then physically </v>

1355
00:59:06.451 --> 00:59:06.700
<v Speaker 6>writing down,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I sort of,</v>

1356
00:59:06.730 --> 00:59:11.730
<v Speaker 6>it sort of cemented in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So if you go over and look through my </v>

1357
00:59:11.730 --> 00:59:14.401
<v Speaker 6>notebook,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you'll see like the same notes over and </v>

1358
00:59:14.401 --> 00:59:14.401
<v Speaker 6>over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

1359
00:59:14.401 --> 00:59:15.280
<v Speaker 6>are you fucking crazy?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because I'm just feeling inside.</v>

1360
00:59:15.460 --> 00:59:18.490
<v Speaker 6>I'm just filling in the space.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It helps you remember?</v>

1361
00:59:18.491 --> 00:59:19.160
<v Speaker 6>Definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yes.</v>

1362
00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 6>And then occasionally I write new things</v>

1363
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:26.090
<v Speaker 2>there but I put a big black star next to</v>
<v Speaker 2>new things that are right there.</v>

1364
00:59:26.091 --> 00:59:31.091
<v Speaker 2>So what I use a notebook for and what I </v>
<v Speaker 2>use like my computer for a totally </v>

1365
00:59:31.091 --> 00:59:35.231
<v Speaker 2>different,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a very rarely write a bit on a </v>

1366
00:59:35.231 --> 00:59:35.780
<v Speaker 2>notebook because I can type so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>faster than I could write.</v>

1367
00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:37.410
<v Speaker 2>It seems stupid to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1368
00:59:37.430 --> 00:59:39.100
<v Speaker 2>if I have a great idea for a bit I'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>read.</v>

1369
00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:41.570
<v Speaker 2>I'll jot down what the idea is real </v>
<v Speaker 2>quick.</v>

1370
00:59:41.600 --> 00:59:43.460
<v Speaker 2>But then I do all the writing on an </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual laptop.</v>

1371
00:59:43.490 --> 00:59:43.880
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1372
00:59:43.881 --> 00:59:44.120
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1373
00:59:44.320 --> 00:59:49.320
<v Speaker 3>I'm have to write longhand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think you could fuck with the </v>

1374
00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:49.320
<v Speaker 3>camera though on the iphone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unfortunately.</v>

1375
00:59:49.710 --> 00:59:54.710
<v Speaker 3>That's the only thing that keeps me from</v>
<v Speaker 3>going 100 percent from was better than </v>

1376
00:59:54.710 --> 00:59:55.040
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Quicker.</v>

1377
00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:58.670
<v Speaker 3>Apparently the galaxy five though is a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bad.</v>

1378
00:59:58.671 --> 01:00:00.290
<v Speaker 3>Oxy Five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the Google one,</v>

1379
01:00:00.291 --> 01:00:01.160
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1380

<v Speaker 3>the shadows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Believe it or almost me neither.</v>

1385
01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:13.070

<v Speaker 3>my iphone just does things like what </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's doing now.</v>

1387
01:00:15.561 --> 01:00:17.360
<v Speaker 3>Like things start,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop working.</v>

1388
01:00:17.361 --> 01:00:19.290
<v Speaker 3>Like my speaker doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1389
01:00:19.291 --> 01:00:24.291
<v Speaker 3>That's what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It goes off when you have 25 percent </v>

1390
01:00:24.291 --> 01:00:24.291
<v Speaker 3>battery life left,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but just like,</v>

1391
01:00:24.291 --> 01:00:24.291
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going off on.</v>

1392
01:00:24.291 --> 01:00:27.350
<v Speaker 3>You plug it back in and you still have </v>
<v Speaker 3>25 percent once you started up again.</v>

1393
01:00:27.550 --> 01:00:30.050
<v Speaker 3>She was a new thing that happens when </v>
<v Speaker 3>you just can't trust it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>that's still have access to all our.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Still ridiculous.</v>

1407
01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:00.680
<v Speaker 3>Still ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just more.</v>

1408
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:01.720
<v Speaker 3>They said this ahead of time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1409
01:01:01.790 --> 01:01:03.720
<v Speaker 3>look what Obama's going to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not going to reel it in.</v>

1410
01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:04.610
<v Speaker 3>He's just going to rename it</v>

1411
01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:06.760
<v Speaker 2>and people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1412
01:01:06.910 --> 01:01:11.910
<v Speaker 2>there's good points on both sides and </v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing that people go over all the </v>

1413
01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:11.910
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they always say like,</v>

1414
01:01:12.070 --> 01:01:17.070
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not a criminal then it's not </v>

1415
01:01:17.070 --> 01:01:18.721
<v Speaker 2>gonna affect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't waste any time thinking about </v>

1416
01:01:18.721 --> 01:01:18.721
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>

1417
01:01:18.721 --> 01:01:19.450
<v Speaker 2>And this is why it's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the big one.</v>

1418
01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:24.720
<v Speaker 2>It's not true because like let's say </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you were running for office and </v>

1419
01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:25.480
<v Speaker 2>let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1424
01:01:36.251 --> 01:01:41.251
<v Speaker 2>and maybe they could find that shit out </v>
<v Speaker 2>before you come out and give it to a </v>

1425
01:01:41.251 --> 01:01:41.800
<v Speaker 2>reporter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you to go to get hand jobs and </v>

1428
01:01:49.050 --> 01:01:50.680
<v Speaker 2>they find out about your fucking horn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Love it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You're fucking going to.</v>

1430
01:01:52.381 --> 01:01:55.530
<v Speaker 2>You point to number one through 100 </v>
<v Speaker 2>bookmark.</v>

1431
01:01:55.540 --> 01:01:57.600
<v Speaker 3>So you've got nothing to hide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're like,</v>

1432
01:01:57.610 --> 01:01:58.760
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have things to hide.</v>

1433
01:01:58.761 --> 01:02:02.230
<v Speaker 3>The private things to hide and say stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you've got nothing to hide it.</v>

1434
01:02:02.231 --> 01:02:03.700
<v Speaker 3>Like what if I have two lighters?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>lighters.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Like now I can't like come on man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all this shit.</v>

1437
01:02:08.801 --> 01:02:10.750
<v Speaker 3>You don't have to have anything to hide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1438
01:02:10.751 --> 01:02:11.770
<v Speaker 3>Just leave me alone.</v>

1439
01:02:11.810 --> 01:02:16.210
<v Speaker 2>This is not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not an issue where it should be.</v>

1440
01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:18.980
<v Speaker 2>People should have access to what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1441
01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:21.230
<v Speaker 2>what you enjoy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are your issues?</v>

1442
01:02:21.630 --> 01:02:25.110
<v Speaker 2>It gets to that like red scare thing of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the 19 fifties,</v>

1443
01:02:25.111 --> 01:02:27.520
<v Speaker 2>the McCarthy era.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's really what people,</v>

1444
01:02:27.900 --> 01:02:29.730
<v Speaker 2>what they have to stop criminals that </v>
<v Speaker 2>stop terrorists.</v>

1445
01:02:29.731 --> 01:02:30.330
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1446
01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.370
<v Speaker 2>but we have a set of rules in place </v>
<v Speaker 2>already.</v>

1447
01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:35.100
<v Speaker 2>Do you have to do it that way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why we make cops like,</v>

1448
01:02:35.101 --> 01:02:35.990
<v Speaker 2>well that stuff criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1449
01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.710
<v Speaker 2>But if you want to start somebodies </v>
<v Speaker 2>house,</v>

1450
01:02:37.770 --> 01:02:39.470
<v Speaker 2>you need a warrant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1451
01:02:39.471 --> 01:02:41.520
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how it feels to stop </v>
<v Speaker 2>criminals.</v>

1452
01:02:41.610 --> 01:02:43.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how effective they are </v>
<v Speaker 2>stopping crime by.</v>

1453
01:02:44.430 --> 01:02:46.560
<v Speaker 2>They will never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just keep pointing to that.</v>

1454
01:02:46.890 --> 01:02:47.670
<v Speaker 2>They have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have,</v>

1455
01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:53.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a memos that they all sent out to each </v>

1456
01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:53.430
<v Speaker 2>other saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>use nine slash 11 to justify this.</v>

1457
01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:54.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen that.</v>

1458
01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:56.930
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It said,</v>

1459
01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:57.490
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

1460
01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:58.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm still doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're like,</v>

1461
01:02:58.951 --> 01:02:59.790
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no control.</v>

1462
01:02:59.791 --> 01:03:04.791
<v Speaker 2>Let them do whatever they want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking of becoming a narrow list </v>

1463
01:03:04.791 --> 01:03:04.791
<v Speaker 2>thing of saying fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a nihilist.</v>

1464
01:03:04.791 --> 01:03:05.040
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>

1465
01:03:05.410 --> 01:03:06.360
<v Speaker 2>Fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do whatever you want.</v>

1466
01:03:06.361 --> 01:03:10.800
<v Speaker 2>Let me just be clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm libertarian now.</v>

1467
01:03:10.830 --> 01:03:15.830
<v Speaker 2>I think what you should do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is just continue being honest </v>

1468
01:03:16.471 --> 01:03:18.870
<v Speaker 2>about what you think about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at some point like,</v>

1469
01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:21.690
<v Speaker 2>don't you ever feel like I'm going to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything?</v>

1470
01:03:21.870 --> 01:03:25.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it does do something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just think it takes a long ass time.</v>

1471
01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:29.280
<v Speaker 2>And I think one of the big things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>it does is when people.</v>

1472
01:03:29.281 --> 01:03:31.980
<v Speaker 2>And this is going to sound kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>silly,</v>

1473
01:03:32.010 --> 01:03:37.010
<v Speaker 2>but it is true when people make jokes </v>
<v Speaker 2>about things that joke changes a little </v>

1474
01:03:38.131 --> 01:03:40.620
<v Speaker 2>bit of the public's perception and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's,</v>

1475
01:03:40.621 --> 01:03:45.621
<v Speaker 2>what's your givens are based in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the job will like save guy like Stan </v>

1476
01:03:45.621 --> 01:03:49.850
<v Speaker 2>hope regard like you does a bit shitting</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the Tsa and you do a bit that makes a</v>

1477
01:03:50.101 --> 01:03:53.640
<v Speaker 2>lot of sense and it shits on the TSA is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that bit becomes popular,</v>

1478
01:03:53.641 --> 01:03:58.641
<v Speaker 2>that bit gets out there into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>makes people feel a little bit worse </v>

1479
01:03:58.641 --> 01:03:58.641
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>

1480
01:03:58.641 --> 01:04:02.390
<v Speaker 2>But then what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then what happens is public </v>

1481
01:04:02.390 --> 01:04:03.150
<v Speaker 2>perception changes and what the public </v>
<v Speaker 2>perception changes.</v>

1482
01:04:03.151 --> 01:04:07.140
<v Speaker 2>It starts to shift who people voted on </v>
<v Speaker 2>based on what they support and what they</v>

1483
01:04:07.141 --> 01:04:12.141
<v Speaker 2>don't support.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you go over a certain threshold </v>

1484
01:04:12.141 --> 01:04:12.540
<v Speaker 2>where like all these people want this </v>
<v Speaker 2>and eventually the boat for them.</v>

1485
01:04:12.541 --> 01:04:13.960
<v Speaker 2>But like legalize marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

1486
01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:19.080
<v Speaker 2>there's no candidate where you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually get that even though most </v>

1487
01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:19.080
<v Speaker 2>people want it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's moving that direction.</v>

1488
01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:23.241
<v Speaker 2>And it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's obviously moving in that </v>

1489
01:04:23.241 --> 01:04:23.241
<v Speaker 2>direction cause something like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

1490
01:04:23.241 --> 01:04:26.751
<v Speaker 2>You'd probably need like 75 percent or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something where the old people are </v>

1491
01:04:26.751 --> 01:04:27.000
<v Speaker 2>outnumbered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1492
01:04:27.001 --> 01:04:32.001
<v Speaker 2>you really need is money and that's what</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they have now and money changes </v>

1493
01:04:32.001 --> 01:04:33.950
<v Speaker 2>perceptions mean the reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the reasons why advertising,</v>

1494
01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:37.800
<v Speaker 2>CNN things you're seeing on weed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Sanjay Gupta pieces.</v>

1495
01:04:38.130 --> 01:04:40.260
<v Speaker 2>It's not just that it's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

1496
01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:45.260
<v Speaker 2>That was because there's a public shift </v>
<v Speaker 2>in perception and that public shift in </v>

1497
01:04:45.931 --> 01:04:50.931
<v Speaker 2>perception accepts things that it would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have thought of as drugs during the </v>

1498
01:04:50.931 --> 01:04:51.410
<v Speaker 2>Nancy Reagan administration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1499
01:04:51.430 --> 01:04:53.310
<v Speaker 2>Nancy Reagan was doing that just ain't </v>
<v Speaker 2>no shit.</v>

1500
01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:58.520
<v Speaker 2>You could have never had sonjay gooped </v>
<v Speaker 2>on CNN and realize they can get Sanjay </v>

1501
01:04:58.520 --> 01:04:59.250
<v Speaker 2>Gupta talking about like how we should </v>
<v Speaker 2>be good and we're like,</v>

1502
01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:00.420
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can actually get viewers.</v>

1503
01:05:00.450 --> 01:05:05.450
<v Speaker 2>If you put that on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got a lot of people who want to say </v>

1504
01:05:05.450 --> 01:05:05.450
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's also like what's going on in</v>

1505
01:05:05.450 --> 01:05:10.011
<v Speaker 2>Colorado is the amount of money that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>being generated by weed is undeniable </v>

1506
01:05:10.011 --> 01:05:13.581
<v Speaker 2>now and they get so much and there's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much going on that it gets to a certain </v>

1507
01:05:13.581 --> 01:05:14.580
<v Speaker 2>point in time where people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1508
01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:18.880
<v Speaker 2>there's no crime spree starts </v>
<v Speaker 2>influencing all the politicians.</v>

1509
01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:24.120
<v Speaker 2>The money starts influencing all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>different people in our corner for once </v>

1510
01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.000
<v Speaker 2>it comes to marijuana lobby essentially.</v>

1511
01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:27.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were just.</v>

1512
01:05:27.490 --> 01:05:29.080
<v Speaker 2>But that's the problem with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That should be.</v>

1513
01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:31.830
<v Speaker 2>That should even be allowed to have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>work what?</v>

1514
01:05:31.831 --> 01:05:32.470
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1515
01:05:32.490 --> 01:05:37.490
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's nice that we're working in our </v>

1516
01:05:37.490 --> 01:05:39.721
<v Speaker 2>favor this time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not necessarily working in our </v>

1517
01:05:39.721 --> 01:05:42.331
<v Speaker 2>favor either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just beginning to work in our </v>

1518
01:05:42.331 --> 01:05:42.331
<v Speaker 2>favor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

1519
01:05:42.331 --> 01:05:45.240
<v Speaker 2>So you think after a number of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>hear about something and start to </v>

1520
01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:45.240
<v Speaker 2>influence their opinion?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1521
01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:47.800
<v Speaker 2>Then the government will then to appease</v>
<v Speaker 2>those people will change their mind.</v>

1522
01:05:47.820 --> 01:05:48.190
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it did.</v>

1523
01:05:48.191 --> 01:05:50.650
<v Speaker 2>Change is who the government is just </v>
<v Speaker 2>takes time.</v>

1524
01:05:50.890 --> 01:05:55.890
<v Speaker 2>It changes what the culture is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the culture accepts with the </v>

1525
01:05:55.890 --> 01:05:56.860
<v Speaker 2>culture doesn't accept,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it changes and it changes based on.</v>

1526
01:05:57.010 --> 01:06:00.730
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it is public perception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it can be influenced by art and</v>

1527
01:06:00.731 --> 01:06:05.731
<v Speaker 2>music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things that get out there that get </v>

1528
01:06:05.731 --> 01:06:05.731
<v Speaker 2>people to resonate and his ideas and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then money.</v>

1529
01:06:05.731 --> 01:06:09.010
<v Speaker 2>Money is the other big one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when the thing is it has all of them.</v>

1530
01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:12.920
<v Speaker 2>There's all these things and money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1531
01:06:13.530 --> 01:06:15.160
<v Speaker 2>So when a big business come in and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1532
01:06:15.161 --> 01:06:20.161
<v Speaker 2>well maybe 50 percent of people are </v>
<v Speaker 2>against something and it will be on our </v>

1533
01:06:20.161 --> 01:06:21.220
<v Speaker 2>best interest to like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're not against it,</v>

1534
01:06:21.221 --> 01:06:26.221
<v Speaker 2>if they're for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they just come in and say if there's </v>

1535
01:06:26.221 --> 01:06:26.221
<v Speaker 2>maybe 50 percent of people against it </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the percent of people for it,</v>

1536
01:06:26.221 --> 01:06:31.020
<v Speaker 2>they want to shift that and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>politician's mind the importance of </v>

1537
01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:32.710
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that you support that CNN and things</v>

1538
01:06:32.711 --> 01:06:33.060
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1539
01:06:33.061 --> 01:06:35.650
<v Speaker 2>have a television show that shows the </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive side of weed.</v>

1540
01:06:35.651 --> 01:06:37.990
<v Speaker 2>That will definitely shift thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or like the unions in New York,</v>

1541
01:06:37.991 --> 01:06:42.991
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to keep mma out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether like just get through to the </v>

1542
01:06:42.991 --> 01:06:42.991
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at this guys,</v>

1543
01:06:42.991 --> 01:06:43.520
<v Speaker 2>brain damage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>barbaric.</v>

1544
01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.580
<v Speaker 2>Nicholas Chicago politicians go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ha,</v>

1545
01:06:45.970 --> 01:06:47.410
<v Speaker 2>that's a stat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen that stat.</v>

1546
01:06:47.411 --> 01:06:49.150
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1547
01:06:49.210 --> 01:06:54.210
<v Speaker 2>there's most certainly that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you're seeing with like what's </v>

1548
01:06:54.210 --> 01:06:57.280
<v Speaker 2>going on in Colorado too is that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are getting old enough to that.</v>

1549
01:06:57.310 --> 01:07:00.070
<v Speaker 2>The people that are like in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>twenties and thirties that are voting,</v>

1550
01:07:00.370 --> 01:07:03.280
<v Speaker 2>they've grown up with the internet and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they know it's bullshit.</v>

1551
01:07:03.550 --> 01:07:06.760
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to own them the way you</v>
<v Speaker 2>own 50 year old people today.</v>

1552
01:07:06.761 --> 01:07:08.230
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Someone's saying this.</v>

1553
01:07:08.231 --> 01:07:10.330
<v Speaker 2>That's why Arizona always vote so </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative.</v>

1554
01:07:10.410 --> 01:07:15.410
<v Speaker 2>It's the old people moving there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not the main regular people in </v>

1555
01:07:15.410 --> 01:07:15.610
<v Speaker 2>Phoenix and tempe and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're cool,</v>

1556
01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:20.640
<v Speaker 2>but it's like old people and they vote </v>
<v Speaker 2>and way higher numbers and they are </v>

1557
01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:21.280
<v Speaker 2>afraid of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that the older you get,</v>

1558
01:07:21.281 --> 01:07:22.930
<v Speaker 2>the more conservative you get?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

1559
01:07:23.050 --> 01:07:24.400
<v Speaker 2>because it can't just be because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were like,</v>

1560
01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:25.510
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know when the old people die on.</v>

1561
01:07:25.510 --> 01:07:30.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have already to just from when I </v>

1562
01:07:30.510 --> 01:07:32.971
<v Speaker 2>was five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have already died out to an old </v>

1563
01:07:32.971 --> 01:07:32.971
<v Speaker 2>quote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget who was quoted was because show</v>

1564
01:07:32.971 --> 01:07:36.010
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a young man who's a conservative and</v>

1565
01:07:36.011 --> 01:07:41.011
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you a man with no heart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Show me an old man who's a liberal and </v>

1566
01:07:41.011 --> 01:07:42.310
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you a man with no brain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

1567
01:07:44.230 --> 01:07:47.140
<v Speaker 2>Funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget who made that quote.</v>

1568
01:07:47.141 --> 01:07:50.410
<v Speaker 2>I forget where it's coming from me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the idea is as you get older,</v>

1569
01:07:50.411 --> 01:07:55.411
<v Speaker 2>you realize a lot of what's going on is </v>
<v Speaker 2>people need to just stop being fucking </v>

1570
01:07:55.411 --> 01:07:57.500
<v Speaker 2>babies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need to get their shit together and</v>

1571
01:07:57.530 --> 01:07:58.280
<v Speaker 2>need to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1572
01:07:58.281 --> 01:08:03.281
<v Speaker 2>you need to have stricter laws to cut </v>
<v Speaker 2>back on the nonsense and recidivism and </v>

1573
01:08:03.281 --> 01:08:04.480
<v Speaker 2>crime and you get tougher on crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you get older,</v>

1574
01:08:04.690 --> 01:08:05.500
<v Speaker 2>you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1575
01:08:05.501 --> 01:08:07.360
<v Speaker 2>you want your streets to be protected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

1576
01:08:07.361 --> 01:08:08.500
<v Speaker 2>God dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Enough is enough.</v>

1577
01:08:08.501 --> 01:08:10.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm 65 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to go out.</v>

1578
01:08:10.601 --> 01:08:11.410
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who cares,</v>

1579
01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:12.690
<v Speaker 2>kill 'em,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all Kev,</v>

1580
01:08:12.691 --> 01:08:16.010
<v Speaker 2>all these goddamn criminals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You start getting that of an attitude.</v>

1581
01:08:16.490 --> 01:08:21.490
<v Speaker 4>You also start going like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like things done the way they've been </v>

1582
01:08:21.490 --> 01:08:24.641
<v Speaker 4>done and so you just don't want change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think a lot of times with gay </v>

1583
01:08:24.641 --> 01:08:24.641
<v Speaker 4>marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things like that,</v>

1584
01:08:24.641 --> 01:08:26.390
<v Speaker 4>it's the same kind of like a push back </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you'll get when,</v>

1585
01:08:26.391 --> 01:08:31.391
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when the Catholic church turned the </v>

1586
01:08:31.391 --> 01:08:31.391
<v Speaker 4>priest around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] father told me that,</v>

1587
01:08:31.391 --> 01:08:33.350
<v Speaker 4>like they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody went crazy,</v>

1588
01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:36.200
<v Speaker 4>turn the priests around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one point he was facing the audience and</v>

1589
01:08:36.201 --> 01:08:41.201
<v Speaker 4>then the big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Catholic thing that they all deal </v>

1590
01:08:41.201 --> 01:08:41.201
<v Speaker 4>with the big meeting they've had to </v>
<v Speaker 4>have,</v>

1591
01:08:41.201 --> 01:08:41.390
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1592
01:08:41.470 --> 01:08:42.920
<v Speaker 4>a Vatican two,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it was.</v>

1593
01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:43.640
<v Speaker 4>Then they say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1594
01:08:43.641 --> 01:08:47.150
<v Speaker 4>now you face the arc or whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 4>front with the people or vice versa.</v>

1595
01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:48.140
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Turn him around.</v>

1596
01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:51.410
<v Speaker 4>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>remember our parents losing their minds,</v>

1597
01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:53.990
<v Speaker 4>no way to worship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well you kidding me,</v>

1598
01:08:53.991 --> 01:08:55.790
<v Speaker 4>and now I want you to take it for </v>
<v Speaker 4>granted because that's the way it's been</v>

1599
01:08:55.791 --> 01:08:57.620
<v Speaker 4>done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no way to worship.</v>

1600
01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:00.710
<v Speaker 4>And people go crazy because they want it</v>
<v Speaker 4>done their way.</v>

1601
01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:05.860
<v Speaker 4>And when you've used this something for </v>
<v Speaker 4>50 years of your life and suddenly it </v>

1602
01:09:05.860 --> 01:09:05.860
<v Speaker 4>changed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>

01:09:05.860 --> 01:09:05.930
<v Speaker 4>two guys are getting married.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1604
01:09:06.170 --> 01:09:07.850
<v Speaker 4>this is not the way I like it.</v>

1605
01:09:07.940 --> 01:09:12.940
<v Speaker 2>This is against the sanctimony to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sanctity of a marriage.</v>

1606
01:09:13.330 --> 01:09:18.330
<v Speaker 4>It's the same shit that when your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when your favorite restaurant takes an </v>

1607
01:09:18.330 --> 01:09:18.330
<v Speaker 4>item off the menu,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like what not.</v>

1608
01:09:18.330 --> 01:09:18.880
<v Speaker 4>That was the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like that item.</v>

1609
01:09:19.270 --> 01:09:21.220
<v Speaker 4>I want it done my way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

1610
01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:26.280
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if a restaurant taking item</v>
<v Speaker 4>off the menu because of the same place </v>

1611
01:09:26.280 --> 01:09:28.450
<v Speaker 4>for them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They want it done their way.</v>

1612
01:09:28.890 --> 01:09:30.580
<v Speaker 4>They've been going to that restaurant </v>
<v Speaker 4>for 45 years.</v>

1613
01:09:30.610 --> 01:09:32.170
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean yelling at a club </v>
<v Speaker 4>sandwich anymore.</v>

1614
01:09:32.171 --> 01:09:33.340
<v Speaker 4>That's my.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was my thing.</v>

1615
01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:37.660
<v Speaker 4>People don't resist change and I think a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of that is insecurity.</v>

1616
01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:43.040
<v Speaker 4>That's a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think a lot of it is a that did just </v>

1617
01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:46.951
<v Speaker 4>scared.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People are scared of marriage is one </v>

1618
01:09:46.951 --> 01:09:46.951
<v Speaker 4>that does not affect the people not </v>
<v Speaker 4>involved in it.</v>

1619
01:09:46.951 --> 01:09:47.940
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pull up the story.</v>

1620
01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:52.340
<v Speaker 2>The Dea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cops raid woman's home after she shops</v>

1621
01:09:52.350 --> 01:09:53.760
<v Speaker 2>at an indoor garden center</v>

1622
01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:57.510
<v Speaker 4>because they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're watching what?</v>

1623
01:09:57.511 --> 01:10:00.570
<v Speaker 4>She's right where she was because the </v>
<v Speaker 4>dea thinks she's growing marijuana.</v>

1624
01:10:00.571 --> 01:10:02.670
<v Speaker 4>I saw that in the trash.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They took the trash out.</v>

1625
01:10:02.671 --> 01:10:04.130
<v Speaker 4>They didn't test the shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1626
01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:06.390
<v Speaker 4>So how do they even know about it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1627
01:10:06.450 --> 01:10:08.040
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nothing to hide.</v>

1628
01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:13.220
<v Speaker 4>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but meanwhile they busted into my house </v>

1629
01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:15.320
<v Speaker 4>and did a bunch of damage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She came under investigation just </v>

1630
01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:15.320
<v Speaker 4>because she shopped a store,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1631
01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:17.130
<v Speaker 4>Indoor Garden Center.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they thought maybe she was building a</v>

1632
01:10:17.131 --> 01:10:19.020
<v Speaker 4>bond with that without fertilizer or </v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

1633
01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:20.580
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

1634
01:10:20.610 --> 01:10:22.760
<v Speaker 2>thought she was growing weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what they thought.</v>

1635
01:10:22.761 --> 01:10:26.500
<v Speaker 2>But the idea is that this woman didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>get caught for any other crimes,</v>

1636
01:10:26.501 --> 01:10:31.501
<v Speaker 2>so they have a warrant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They went through her garbage and they </v>

1637
01:10:31.501 --> 01:10:34.481
<v Speaker 2>stormed her home and an early morning </v>
<v Speaker 2>raid after spotting her shopping at an </v>

1638
01:10:34.481 --> 01:10:37.130
<v Speaker 2>indoor garden center that they had been </v>
<v Speaker 2>staking out.</v>

1639
01:10:37.370 --> 01:10:38.420
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on man.</v>

1640
01:10:38.570 --> 01:10:42.230
<v Speaker 2>There's a real problem with our lives </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're going after people.</v>

1641
01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:44.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two books on how to grow marijuana.</v>

1642
01:10:44.451 --> 01:10:47.120
<v Speaker 2>They found some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some weed stuff in her house.</v>

1643
01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:50.780
<v Speaker 2>So they were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what zip drive from 1982.</v>

1644
01:10:51.010 --> 01:10:52.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

1645
01:10:53.170 --> 01:10:55.640
<v Speaker 2>But so what the point is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1646
01:10:55.790 --> 01:10:58.010
<v Speaker 2>get people will abuse power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guess what?</v>

1647
01:10:58.011 --> 01:11:03.011
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing wrong with fucking </v>

1648
01:11:03.011 --> 01:11:03.011
<v Speaker 2>marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1649
01:11:03.011 --> 01:11:04.170
<v Speaker 2>Can we just establish that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we stop at the ball and like five of</v>

1650
01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:09.220
<v Speaker 2>the dea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would the dea thinks that it's okay </v>

1651
01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:11.330
<v Speaker 2>to stake out a fucking garden center and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then break into people's houses?</v>

1652
01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:13.500
<v Speaker 2>So what did they find when they broke </v>
<v Speaker 2>into her house?</v>

1653
01:11:13.501 --> 01:11:14.020
<v Speaker 2>They found</v>

1654
01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:17.130
<v Speaker 6>shared like nine grams of marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh No.</v>

1655
01:11:17.131 --> 01:11:18.330
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Her own stuff.</v>

1656
01:11:18.570 --> 01:11:21.030
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So they said they found nine point three</v>

1657
01:11:21.031 --> 01:11:24.750
<v Speaker 6>grams of marijuana in her art room.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jesus Christ.</v>

1658
01:11:24.751 --> 01:11:28.230
<v Speaker 6>So she smokes weed and does art.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And what happened?</v>

1659
01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:30.630
<v Speaker 6>They broke her fucking house,</v>
<v Speaker 6>door down,</v>

1660
01:11:30.870 --> 01:11:34.080
<v Speaker 6>rated it with guns.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Here's my friend told me about it.</v>

1661
01:11:34.081 --> 01:11:35.280
<v Speaker 6>Once in a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's pretty clear.</v>

1662
01:11:35.310 --> 01:11:37.650
<v Speaker 6>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I get a government not wanting you to do</v>

1663
01:11:37.651 --> 01:11:39.270
<v Speaker 6>certain things.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't agree with it,</v>

1664
01:11:39.271 --> 01:11:41.340
<v Speaker 6>but I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Don't smoke marijuana,</v>

1665
01:11:41.341 --> 01:11:44.670
<v Speaker 6>but if you are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you are smoking pot or doing whatever</v>

<v Speaker 6>just tell you you need to surrender your</v>

1667

<v Speaker 6>citizen of this country is your freedom </v>
<v Speaker 6>and say you have to give that up now for</v>

<v Speaker 6>That's a whole nother pr.</v>

1672
01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.700
<v Speaker 6>That's a whole nother whole nother thing</v>
<v Speaker 6>and here's the other part of it.</v>

1673
01:12:02.910 --> 01:12:07.910
<v Speaker 6>They.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They investigated a month long </v>

1674
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:10.500
<v Speaker 6>investigation that involved federal </v>
<v Speaker 6>agents searching through her garbage and</v>

1675
01:12:10.501 --> 01:12:14.670
<v Speaker 6>comparing her electric bill to those </v>
<v Speaker 6>have a couple neighbors.</v>

1676
01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:20.120
<v Speaker 6>They searched through her garbage and </v>
<v Speaker 6>checked her electric bill and that the </v>

1677
01:12:20.371 --> 01:12:24.750
<v Speaker 6>fact that she was spending money on </v>
<v Speaker 6>electricity for whatever fucking reason,</v>

1678
01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:27.120
<v Speaker 6>a bunch of other stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure she was,</v>

1679
01:12:27.210 --> 01:12:32.080
<v Speaker 6>but who cares if she was growing wheat?</v>
<v Speaker 6>The idea that the on the,</v>

1680
01:12:32.100 --> 01:12:34.470
<v Speaker 6>on the presumption like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>oh look what you're doing.</v>

1681
01:12:34.471 --> 01:12:34.890
<v Speaker 6>Where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

1682
01:12:34.891 --> 01:12:36.300
<v Speaker 6>she just had some in her house.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

1683
01:12:36.301 --> 01:12:39.690
<v Speaker 6>the only reason they arrested her.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The only reason why they did it,</v>

1684
01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:43.170
<v Speaker 6>the only reason why the investigator it </v>
<v Speaker 6>was she was shopping at a garden store.</v>

1685
01:12:43.370 --> 01:12:45.000
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that is fucking crazy.</v>

1686
01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.360
<v Speaker 6>You can't just do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How long until the government fucks with</v>

1687
01:12:48.361 --> 01:12:50.340
<v Speaker 6>you until you say fucking slap their </v>
<v Speaker 6>hand away.</v>

1688
01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:52.890
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is one want to fund that.</v>

1689
01:12:52.950 --> 01:12:57.950
<v Speaker 6>Another one is recent because this one </v>
<v Speaker 6>is people that actually were dea agents </v>

1690
01:12:59.101 --> 01:13:03.030
<v Speaker 6>that we're breaking down the door and </v>
<v Speaker 6>they were looking for um,</v>

1691
01:13:03.150 --> 01:13:03.830
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>on,</v>

1692
01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:05.010
<v Speaker 6>on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>on civilians.</v>

<v Speaker 6>He pay attention on the fuck you doing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Looking around for something that I want</v>

1694
01:13:08.430 --> 01:13:10.640
<v Speaker 6>more.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm still listening.</v>

1695
01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:12.450
<v Speaker 6>Will have to roll a joint.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What did I say?</v>

1696
01:13:12.451 --> 01:13:14.700
<v Speaker 6>What we're talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Civilians busting the door down.</v>

1697
01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:16.470
<v Speaker 6>The thing where you just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you just,</v>

1698
01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:17.610

1699
01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:20.640
<v Speaker 6>but you pretend you still place a couple</v>
<v Speaker 6>of words.</v>

1700
01:13:20.641 --> 01:13:25.641
<v Speaker 6>The point is they did it recently to </v>
<v Speaker 6>these two former CIA agents growing </v>

1701
01:13:25.641 --> 01:13:27.600
<v Speaker 6>tomatoes and the fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the feds.</v>

<v Speaker 6>The dea broke down their fucking door </v>
<v Speaker 6>and came in guns drawn.</v>

1703
01:13:31.320 --> 01:13:36.320
<v Speaker 6>These were former CIA agents because </v>
<v Speaker 6>they were growing tomatoes actually in </v>

1704
01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:42.460
<v Speaker 6>their garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They said it's weird and they didn't </v>

<v Speaker 6>test it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They actually had vegetables like there,</v>

1707
01:13:48.441 --> 01:13:51.180
<v Speaker 6>basement and the cops use that as an </v>
<v Speaker 6>excuse to break down your door and point</v>

1708
01:13:51.181 --> 01:13:56.181
<v Speaker 6>guns at you.</v>

<v Speaker 6>if they think it's okay to actually </v>

1710
01:13:58.371 --> 01:14:00.621
<v Speaker 6>point guns at people because they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>growing something that's fucking crazy,</v>

1711
01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:04.020
<v Speaker 6>that's just fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The fact that these cops think that it's</v>

1712
01:14:04.021 --> 01:14:09.021
<v Speaker 6>okay to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whoever it is is giving them the </v>

1713
01:14:09.021 --> 01:14:09.510
<v Speaker 6>direction,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever fucking help guide or happy cop</v>

1714
01:14:09.511 --> 01:14:14.511
<v Speaker 6>like they have in Albuquerque,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they should dogs on them almost </v>

1715
01:14:14.511 --> 01:14:16.831
<v Speaker 6>immediately when you shoot them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even small dogs and they do it to scare </v>

1716
01:14:16.831 --> 01:14:21.811
<v Speaker 6>the fuck out of people.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean they also do it to let them know </v>

1717
01:14:21.811 --> 01:14:21.811
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is real shit.</v>

1718
01:14:21.811 --> 01:14:22.600
<v Speaker 6>I just shot your dog.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I will shoot you.</v>

1719
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:28.030
<v Speaker 6>Then they'll.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They did do it to intimidate people and </v>

1720
01:14:28.030 --> 01:14:28.030
<v Speaker 6>they do it because a lot of them are </v>
<v Speaker 6>just fucking sadistic.</v>

1721
01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:30.490
<v Speaker 6>Says Crazy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

1722
01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:32.980
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Crazy shit.</v>

1723
01:14:33.070 --> 01:14:36.280
<v Speaker 6>That is unacceptable in a civilized </v>
<v Speaker 6>society.</v>

1724
01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:39.100
<v Speaker 6>It's unacceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The idea that this is a good thing.</v>

1725
01:14:39.430 --> 01:14:43.330
<v Speaker 6>The idea that you're protecting anybody </v>
<v Speaker 6>from anything like that in any way,</v>

1726
01:14:43.331 --> 01:14:44.740
<v Speaker 6>shape or form.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This guy saying,</v>

1727
01:14:44.741 --> 01:14:46.720
<v Speaker 6>you have to knock life better.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Record cops.</v>

1728
01:14:46.721 --> 01:14:48.130
<v Speaker 6>All those like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's not true.</v>

1729
01:14:48.131 --> 01:14:50.200
<v Speaker 6>Then you can record.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Kafka doesn't let them do their job.</v>

1730
01:14:50.201 --> 01:14:52.120
<v Speaker 6>It's just keeps them accountable.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1731
01:14:52.121 --> 01:14:54.130
<v Speaker 6>you're supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're supposed to be able to record,</v>

1732
01:14:54.250 --> 01:14:55.660
<v Speaker 6>but there are some states where you're </v>
<v Speaker 6>not allowed.</v>

1733
01:14:55.661 --> 01:15:00.661
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think there are a few states that are </v>

1734
01:15:00.661 --> 01:15:00.661
<v Speaker 6>fighting it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that shit's ridiculous.</v>

1735
01:15:00.661 --> 01:15:04.201
<v Speaker 6>Like you're recording news,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like it's actually happening and when </v>

1736
01:15:04.201 --> 01:15:04.380
<v Speaker 6>cops are being recorded,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like they.</v>

1737
01:15:04.420 --> 01:15:09.420
<v Speaker 6>Did you see that thing that I tweeted </v>
<v Speaker 6>about la having cops were these things </v>

1738
01:15:09.451 --> 01:15:10.930
<v Speaker 6>about Korean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everything they do.</v>

1739
01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:12.310
<v Speaker 6>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 6>And when they do it,</v>

1740
01:15:12.370 --> 01:15:15.820
<v Speaker 6>they found a drastic decrease in </v>
<v Speaker 6>complaints.</v>

1741
01:15:15.821 --> 01:15:17.890
<v Speaker 6>A drastic decrease in.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1742
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:18.490
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

1743
01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:19.900
<v Speaker 6>beyond the record.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1744
01:15:20.110 --> 01:15:20.920
<v Speaker 6>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1745
01:15:20.921 --> 01:15:23.230
<v Speaker 6>I forgot the actual statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they're are pretty fucking shot.</v>

1746
01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:28.260
<v Speaker 6>They want to record all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they don't want us to record the </v>

1747
01:15:28.260 --> 01:15:28.450
<v Speaker 6>cops at all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>

1748
01:15:28.451 --> 01:15:33.451
<v Speaker 6>It's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's congress still exempt from </v>

1749
01:15:33.451 --> 01:15:33.451
<v Speaker 6>obamacare.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do they exempt themselves?</v>

1750
01:15:33.451 --> 01:15:37.920
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but somebody had a really fucking good </v>

1751
01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:37.920
<v Speaker 6>point the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What was ever said.</v>

1752
01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:40.390
<v Speaker 6>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how is it not insane that you're talking</v>

1753
01:15:40.391 --> 01:15:45.391
<v Speaker 6>about a country that doesn't force </v>
<v Speaker 6>people to have proof of their </v>

1754
01:15:46.001 --> 01:15:50.170
<v Speaker 6>citizenship but does to have proof of </v>
<v Speaker 6>your health insurance?</v>

1755
01:15:51.780 --> 01:15:52.990
<v Speaker 6>Do you know how crazy that is?</v>

1756
01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:54.760
<v Speaker 6>They're crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so crazy.</v>

1757
01:15:54.770 --> 01:15:59.770
<v Speaker 6>They're saying you don't have to give </v>
<v Speaker 6>proof of being a citizen of this </v>

1758
01:15:59.770 --> 01:16:01.810
<v Speaker 6>country,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so you can be an illegal alien.</v>

1759
01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:04.360
<v Speaker 6>No one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Everybody will leave you alone,</v>

1760
01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:10.860
<v Speaker 6>but you do have to have proof of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>fact that you're paying an insurance </v>

1761
01:16:10.860 --> 01:16:15.121
<v Speaker 6>company money so shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's when we sell this people picketing </v>

1762
01:16:15.121 --> 01:16:19.951
<v Speaker 6>in Tempe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The last time I think we all went there </v>

1763
01:16:19.951 --> 01:16:19.951
<v Speaker 6>and I was like near the mall and I was </v>
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>

1764
01:16:20.650 --> 01:16:22.690
<v Speaker 6>what if picketing for it was the first </v>
<v Speaker 6>time I was like,</v>

1765
01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:24.880
<v Speaker 6>they must be a reason why these 100 </v>
<v Speaker 6>people are out,</v>

1766
01:16:25.720 --> 01:16:27.760
<v Speaker 6>and then I realized later it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because I just thought it was like,</v>

1767
01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:32.820
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got to make sure everyone gets health </v>

1768
01:16:32.820 --> 01:16:32.820
<v Speaker 6>care,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but now it's like another.</v>

1769
01:16:32.820 --> 01:16:35.700
<v Speaker 6>You're forcing everyone to buy insurance</v>
<v Speaker 6>so the insurance company can still make </v>

1770
01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:35.700
<v Speaker 6>a lot of early.</v>

1771
01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:40.680
<v Speaker 6>The way it's been explained to me,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not obamacare as much as it's the </v>

1772
01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:42.790
<v Speaker 6>affordable care act,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is tacked onto obamacare.</v>

1773
01:16:43.690 --> 01:16:44.480
<v Speaker 6>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1774
01:16:44.610 --> 01:16:48.040
<v Speaker 6>whenever you have bills that are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that have good intentions,</v>

1775
01:16:48.970 --> 01:16:53.110
<v Speaker 6>all sorts of special interest attached </v>
<v Speaker 6>there needs to bills and things that get</v>

1776
01:16:53.111 --> 01:16:56.560
<v Speaker 6>passed off and have these clauses that </v>
<v Speaker 6>have no nothing to do with it.</v>

1777
01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:57.970
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not only have nothing to do,</v>

1778
01:16:57.971 --> 01:17:02.971
<v Speaker 6>but they have like far ranging </v>
<v Speaker 6>implications on the simpsons when they </v>

1779
01:17:02.971 --> 01:17:06.540
<v Speaker 6>were trying to get out of town,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like the built a vacuum at the simpsons </v>

1780
01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:06.540
<v Speaker 6>because the media was gonna hit them.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like all in favor.</v>

1781
01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:08.260
<v Speaker 6>It's like I'd like to tack on a pro </v>
<v Speaker 6>pornography bill with that.</v>

1782
01:17:09.130 --> 01:17:11.000
<v Speaker 6>They all voted against it and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>ah,</v>

1783
01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:13.310
<v Speaker 6>and that is what they do and can back </v>
<v Speaker 6>and was like,</v>

1784
01:17:13.311 --> 01:17:14.750
<v Speaker 6>this is why democracy doesn't work.</v>

1785
01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:16.430
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1786
01:17:16.431 --> 01:17:21.431
<v Speaker 6>So they tack on Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So with the affordable care act is </v>

1787
01:17:21.431 --> 01:17:21.431
<v Speaker 6>different than obamacare.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Allegedly.</v>

1788
01:17:21.431 --> 01:17:25.750
<v Speaker 6>I haven't investigated enough.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Peter Schiff will probably know his </v>

1789
01:17:25.750 --> 01:17:28.391
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He has a podcast probably educate me on </v>

1790
01:17:28.391 --> 01:17:28.391
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>saying they fucking gets crazy and start</v>

1791
01:17:28.391 --> 01:17:30.050
<v Speaker 6>screaming about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Insurance companies aren't like good,</v>

1792
01:17:30.410 --> 01:17:32.240
<v Speaker 6>it's not like good at what they do and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then you're like,</v>

1793
01:17:32.270 --> 01:17:37.270
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>too bad you have to have that bad deal </v>

1794
01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:37.550
<v Speaker 6>about the idea of insurance.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's fucking crazy.</v>

1795
01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:42.580
<v Speaker 6>The idea that you're going to gamble </v>
<v Speaker 6>whether or not you get sick or hurting </v>

1796
01:17:42.580 --> 01:17:44.120
<v Speaker 6>coggins fucked up and if it does,</v>
<v Speaker 6>these people pay for it,</v>

1797
01:17:44.121 --> 01:17:46.490
<v Speaker 6>like the whole economy sort of pay for </v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

1798
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:51.550
<v Speaker 6>They'll enemy of credit and the whole </v>
<v Speaker 6>economy of like being able to purchase </v>

1799
01:17:51.550 --> 01:17:55.961
<v Speaker 6>things in advance that you can pay off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>All of that is like a kind of financial </v>

1800
01:17:56.451 --> 01:18:00.050
<v Speaker 6>indentured servitude and almost everyone</v>
<v Speaker 6>falls into it.</v>

1801
01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:05.280
<v Speaker 6>When you want to talk about college,</v>
<v Speaker 6>College on the grid begin before you </v>

1802
01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:08.360
<v Speaker 6>have any show and they got you in debt </v>
<v Speaker 6>already and they get used to it for free</v>

1803
01:18:08.361 --> 01:18:13.361
<v Speaker 6>tee shirt that's has fucking umass on it</v>
<v Speaker 6>or what's going on with college </v>

1804
01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:16.070
<v Speaker 6>sweatshirt was his name.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Belushi Lucia.</v>

1805
01:18:16.071 --> 01:18:18.890
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one of those on white.</v>

1806
01:18:18.990 --> 01:18:20.690
<v Speaker 6>I don't even a cool one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1807
01:18:20.691 --> 01:18:22.670
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you really stop and think about it,</v>

1808
01:18:22.671 --> 01:18:24.200
<v Speaker 6>that is exactly what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

1809
01:18:24.770 --> 01:18:27.680
<v Speaker 6>You go to college and they know these </v>
<v Speaker 6>kids don't have any income,</v>

1810
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:30.980
<v Speaker 6>but they're still giving credit cards.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They know they don't have income.</v>

1811
01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:35.010
<v Speaker 6>They will only default and they're </v>
<v Speaker 6>chocking up all this debt before.</v>

1812
01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:40.080
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>think about the idea that you have to </v>

1813
01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:40.220
<v Speaker 6>pay for four years of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of living.</v>

1814
01:18:40.221 --> 01:18:42.400
<v Speaker 6>That's a bad deal to after it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1815
01:18:42.530 --> 01:18:45.650
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like four years of everything for a year</v>

1816
01:18:45.651 --> 01:18:49.070
<v Speaker 6>you have to pay for four years of back.</v>

1817
01:18:49.490 --> 01:18:54.490
<v Speaker 6>Pay It back.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like if you had to do four years of </v>

1818
01:18:54.490 --> 01:18:54.490
<v Speaker 6>anything and then pay it after it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>over.</v>

1819
01:18:54.490 --> 01:18:57.040
<v Speaker 6>What a mess that would you imagine if </v>
<v Speaker 6>like you,</v>

1820
01:18:57.041 --> 01:19:01.180
<v Speaker 6>you like all your food went on credit.</v>

1821
01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:04.220
<v Speaker 6>my student loans just paid it this year.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Last year.</v>

1822
01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:08.330
<v Speaker 6>You paid them off scare a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh Wow.</v>

1823
01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:13.360
<v Speaker 6>That's so scary and doesn't want me to </v>
<v Speaker 6>but like 85 bucks a month more than.</v>

1824
01:19:13.950 --> 01:19:15.770
<v Speaker 6>I think that's probably why.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1825
01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:16.940
<v Speaker 6>For this deal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

1826
01:19:16.941 --> 01:19:18.200
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's not even a good deal.</v>

1827
01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:24.400
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's the only way to get a career </v>

1828
01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:25.841
<v Speaker 6>though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess you have to pay for college and </v>

1829
01:19:25.841 --> 01:19:27.860
<v Speaker 6>everyone going up to jack it up.</v>

1841
01:19:58.810 --> 01:20:00.890
<v Speaker 6>disinterested in education.</v>

<v Speaker 6>sort of a standard,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1886
01:21:50.391 --> 01:21:50.391
<v Speaker 6>people's businesses because you've got </v>
<v Speaker 6>to find out where the problems are,</v>

1887
01:21:50.391 --> 01:21:51.780
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>especially when you have children,</v>

<v Speaker 6>It was always,</v>

1892
01:22:00.991 --> 01:22:02.430
<v Speaker 6>that was the biggest problem with </v>
<v Speaker 6>gossip,</v>

1893
01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:04.800
<v Speaker 6>but it was also coming from a place of </v>
<v Speaker 6>like everyone's door was open.</v>

1894
01:22:04.801 --> 01:22:06.600

01:24:20.811 --> 01:24:20.930
<v Speaker 8>this coloring in it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's been proven to give you cancer.</v>

1946
01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.220
<v Speaker 8>Newcastle,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Newcastle,</v>

1947
01:24:22.470 --> 01:24:25.540
<v Speaker 8>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And</v>

1948
01:24:25.540 --> 01:24:30.540
<v Speaker 6>this third hand,</v>
<v Speaker 6>smoke is generally considered to be </v>

1949
01:24:30.540 --> 01:24:33.481
<v Speaker 6>residual nicotine and other chemicals </v>
<v Speaker 6>left on a variety of indoor surfaces by </v>

1950
01:24:33.481 --> 01:24:37.231
<v Speaker 6>tobacco smoke.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The residue is thought to react with </v>

1951
01:24:37.231 --> 01:24:39.400
<v Speaker 6>common indoor pollutants to create a </v>
<v Speaker 6>toxic mix.</v>

1952
01:24:40.030 --> 01:24:45.030
<v Speaker 6>This toxic mix of thirdhand smoke </v>
<v Speaker 6>contains cancer causing substances </v>

1953
01:24:45.030 --> 01:24:48.610
<v Speaker 6>posing a potential health hazard to </v>
<v Speaker 6>nonsmokers who are exposed to it,</v>

1954
01:24:48.611 --> 01:24:53.611
<v Speaker 6>especially children.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So like if somebody wife's tables out </v>

1955
01:24:53.611 --> 01:24:53.611
<v Speaker 6>down,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if it had cigarette smoke,</v>

1956
01:24:53.611 --> 01:24:55.390
<v Speaker 6>like honor from smoking around a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was my wife that down,</v>

1957
01:24:55.900 --> 01:24:58.740
<v Speaker 6>it would combine with that is possible </v>
<v Speaker 6>with that.</v>

1958
01:24:59.170 --> 01:25:02.350
<v Speaker 6>That's exactly what they're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And what they're saying is that other,</v>

1959
01:25:02.351 --> 01:25:05.560
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>indoor chemicals can create a toxic,</v>

1960
01:25:05.650 --> 01:25:10.650
<v Speaker 6>a toxic mix.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So it's not that smoking in a room can </v>

1961
01:25:10.650 --> 01:25:14.491
<v Speaker 6>get you sick.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is it smoking in the room and somebody </v>

1962
01:25:14.491 --> 01:25:14.491
<v Speaker 6>coming in with windex,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they're going to do that.</v>

1963
01:25:14.491 --> 01:25:15.670
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1964
01:25:15.730 --> 01:25:18.070
<v Speaker 6>It's the chemicals interacting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So,</v>

1965
01:25:18.071 --> 01:25:23.071
<v Speaker 6>but what I want to know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what I'm saying is if they didn't do </v>

1966
01:25:23.071 --> 01:25:25.171
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if nobody ever cleaned it with any </v>

1967
01:25:25.171 --> 01:25:25.171
<v Speaker 6>chemicals,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was no chemicals exposed to it.</v>

1968
01:25:25.171 --> 01:25:26.700
<v Speaker 6>Then it will just be a room that </v>
<v Speaker 6>somebody smoked,</v>

1969
01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:32.160
<v Speaker 6>but it makes sense that the walls,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that brown color that you see at pool </v>

1970
01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:34.090
<v Speaker 6>halls where you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>dudes been smoking there for 50 years.</v>

1971
01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:38.400
<v Speaker 6>That shit is like on the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the walls he has like when you see other</v>

1972
01:25:38.401 --> 01:25:40.330
<v Speaker 6>than the ceiling above blitz with </v>
<v Speaker 6>candles.</v>

1973
01:25:40.420 --> 01:25:41.670
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>just color.</v>

1974
01:25:41.830 --> 01:25:46.830
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that is at least just you could </v>

1975
01:25:46.830 --> 01:25:49.021
<v Speaker 6>stand on just fire smoke over the years.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It must be so deep.</v>

1976
01:25:50.830 --> 01:25:55.830
<v Speaker 6>Those places like those old school </v>
<v Speaker 6>places where it's almost like the walls </v>

1977
01:25:55.830 --> 01:25:58.260
<v Speaker 6>were yellow from small or old people's </v>
<v Speaker 6>houses just like smells in there from,</v>

1978
01:25:58.410 --> 01:25:59.520
<v Speaker 6>from the years it's talking about.</v>

1979
01:25:59.530 --> 01:26:01.570
<v Speaker 6>I couldn't even.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Might not even be now,</v>

1980
01:26:01.571 --> 01:26:04.310
<v Speaker 6>but to it in the nineties when I started</v>
<v Speaker 6>playing pool,</v>

1981
01:26:04.430 --> 01:26:08.240
<v Speaker 6>everybody in these pool hall smoked and </v>
<v Speaker 6>the air conditioning was horrible.</v>

1982
01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:10.780
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ventilation was horrible and I'm so.</v>

1983
01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:15.790
<v Speaker 6>So you'd go to a pool hall and you would</v>
<v Speaker 6>walk in the door and you would just </v>

1984
01:26:15.790 --> 01:26:18.950
<v Speaker 6>immediately be greeted by a cloud of </v>
<v Speaker 6>smoke and you just dealt with it.</v>

1985
01:26:19.220 --> 01:26:24.220
<v Speaker 6>That was just what you did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You go over to the table and dudes were </v>

1986
01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:24.280
<v Speaker 6>smoking and putting their cigarette down</v>
<v Speaker 6>on the table,</v>

1987
01:26:24.281 --> 01:26:26.960
<v Speaker 6>whether a plan it was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there was cigarette burns,</v>

1988
01:26:27.170 --> 01:26:32.170
<v Speaker 6>those lead there have those gold crown </v>
<v Speaker 6>tables and they have that sort of farm </v>

1989
01:26:32.170 --> 01:26:35.930
<v Speaker 6>for Micah look like fake wood railings </v>
<v Speaker 6>and there would be burns all over the </v>

1990
01:26:35.930 --> 01:26:37.880
<v Speaker 6>railings,</v>
<v Speaker 6>believe in people cigarettes.</v>

1991
01:26:38.350 --> 01:26:41.440
<v Speaker 6>So it was super common.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you student poker rooms where you're</v>

1992
01:26:41.450 --> 01:26:44.510
<v Speaker 6>allowed and not allowed where you had to</v>
<v Speaker 6>go out to the rail.</v>

1993
01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:49.750
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So you just run out there and smoke and </v>

1994
01:26:49.750 --> 01:26:52.021
<v Speaker 6>this is so fucking annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I was looking at my yearbook and I was </v>

1995
01:26:52.021 --> 01:26:54.720
<v Speaker 6>like 1989.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It showed all the things that happened </v>

1996
01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:55.070
<v Speaker 6>in 1989.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it says like 1989 first,</v>

1997
01:26:55.071 --> 01:26:58.070
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>any flights over or under three hours.</v>

1998
01:26:58.071 --> 01:27:03.071
<v Speaker 6>Ban On cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>on the airplanes was 1989 only three </v>

1999
01:27:03.071 --> 01:27:03.200
<v Speaker 6>hours.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2000
01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:05.240
<v Speaker 6>I can remember.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was longer than that.</v>

2001
01:27:05.241 --> 01:27:07.070
<v Speaker 6>I can remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I can remember the band.</v>

2002
01:27:07.370 --> 01:27:12.370
<v Speaker 6>I can remember when it happened.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They had a curtain smoke section to </v>

2003
01:27:12.370 --> 01:27:12.370
<v Speaker 6>them,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not smoke session.</v>

2004
01:27:12.370 --> 01:27:13.580
<v Speaker 6>It was hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's hilarious.</v>

2005
01:27:14.510 --> 01:27:17.840
<v Speaker 6>Imagine if you're there with your baby </v>
<v Speaker 6>and some guy behind you is chain smoking</v>

2006
01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:22.920
<v Speaker 6>and you're just like one row ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You have a baby with you that is so </v>

2007
01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:22.920
<v Speaker 6>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2008
01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:27.020
<v Speaker 6>They had the ashtrays in the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In the Bay Watch was on TV.</v>

2009
01:27:27.230 --> 01:27:32.230
<v Speaker 6>That's how stupid people were done was a</v>
<v Speaker 6>country Thomas couldn't check out this </v>

2010
01:27:32.230 --> 01:27:37.061
<v Speaker 6>article,</v>
<v Speaker 6>eight beers that you should stop </v>

2011
01:27:37.061 --> 01:27:38.090
<v Speaker 6>drinking immediately because it has all </v>
<v Speaker 6>these chemicals in what article?</v>

2012
01:27:38.180 --> 01:27:40.310
<v Speaker 6>Number one is new and put it up on the </v>

2015
01:27:48.050 --> 01:27:53.050
<v Speaker 6>God,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and it has cancer causing qualities in </v>

2016
01:27:53.050 --> 01:27:53.050
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 6>fake bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Budweiser.</v>

2020
01:27:59.620 --> 01:28:03.821
<v Speaker 6>Let's see what that has.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Gmo Modified Gmo corn in it and gmo rice</v>

2021
01:28:04.401 --> 01:28:06.170
<v Speaker 6>is anheuser busch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sure.</v>

2022
01:28:06.171 --> 01:28:08.690
<v Speaker 6>It's not as bad as cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Here's the thing,</v>

2023
01:28:08.691 --> 01:28:10.370
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm not sure if it's even bad for you at</v>

2024
01:28:10.371 --> 01:28:15.371
<v Speaker 6>all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's there's two sides of the fence </v>

2025
01:28:15.371 --> 01:28:15.371
<v Speaker 6>on that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>GMO,</v>

2026
01:28:15.371 --> 01:28:15.960
<v Speaker 6>they won't allow you to research it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2027
01:28:16.250 --> 01:28:17.240
<v Speaker 6>Wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is that true?</v>

2028
01:28:17.470 --> 01:28:18.920
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They just tried to ban everything.</v>

2029
01:28:18.921 --> 01:28:20.750
<v Speaker 6>They can't be sued for anything they do </v>
<v Speaker 6>wrong.</v>

2030
01:28:21.230 --> 01:28:23.540
<v Speaker 6>All those people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they just try to get the shit out there.</v>

2031
01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:25.310
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we'll certainly there.</v>

2032
01:28:25.430 --> 01:28:30.430
<v Speaker 6>There's people that are profiting that </v>
<v Speaker 6>are trying to curb the regulations as </v>

2033
01:28:30.430 --> 01:28:31.070
<v Speaker 6>much as possible to maximize their </v>
<v Speaker 6>profits.</v>

2034
01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:32.210
<v Speaker 6>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's happening.</v>

2035
01:28:32.570 --> 01:28:37.570
<v Speaker 6>My question is,</v>
<v Speaker 6>is there anything that shows that GMO </v>

2036
01:28:37.570 --> 01:28:41.021
<v Speaker 6>corn is bad for you?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because there's apparently has nothing </v>

2037
01:28:41.021 --> 01:28:44.560
<v Speaker 6>for you in general has no nutrients.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's got carbohydrates.</v>

2038
01:28:44.580 --> 01:28:46.280
<v Speaker 6>Carbohydrate mean there's something </v>
<v Speaker 6>corn,</v>

2039
01:28:46.281 --> 01:28:48.260
<v Speaker 6>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your body doesn't digest it very well.</v>

2040
01:28:48.590 --> 01:28:49.910
<v Speaker 6>That's why he's always hitting your </v>
<v Speaker 6>shit.</v>

2041
01:28:50.180 --> 01:28:51.890
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's why you see coronary poop because</v>

2042
01:28:51.891 --> 01:28:53.030
<v Speaker 6>your body's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what is this man?</v>

<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:59.500
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you've ever seen that king corn </v>

2045
01:28:59.500 --> 01:28:59.500
<v Speaker 6>documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2046
01:28:59.500 --> 01:28:59.500

<v Speaker 2>Replace sugar in so many different </v>

2058
01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:26.120
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just doesn't seem as bad.</v>

2059
01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:26.950
<v Speaker 2>Government subsidies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

2060
01:29:26.980 --> 01:29:31.980
<v Speaker 2>there's government subsidies to give.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The government gives corn farmers money </v>

2061
01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:36.741
<v Speaker 2>and incentives to grow more corn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They grow corn for cattle feed and then </v>

2062
01:29:36.741 --> 01:29:40.941
<v Speaker 2>the cattle feed makes cows fatter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're dealing with these corn fed </v>

2063
01:29:40.941 --> 01:29:44.570
<v Speaker 2>cows and they're like really fat and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sloppy and delicious and sometimes they </v>

2064
01:29:44.570 --> 01:29:48.381
<v Speaker 2>get like ulcers in their stomachs </v>
<v Speaker 2>because their stomachs are not designed </v>

2065
01:29:48.381 --> 01:29:48.381
<v Speaker 2>to process corn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

2066
01:29:48.381 --> 01:29:53.191
<v Speaker 2>Really fat and like when you see a steak</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the market like you were seeing as a </v>

2067
01:29:53.191 --> 01:29:54.180
<v Speaker 2>sick cow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at all the mumbling,</v>

2068
01:29:54.220 --> 01:29:59.220
<v Speaker 2>Darlene,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is going to make a delicious steak </v>

2069
01:29:59.220 --> 01:29:59.220
<v Speaker 2>on the grill.</v>

2070
01:29:59.220 --> 01:29:59.850
<v Speaker 2>With that is is a fucking sick animal </v>
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

2071
01:29:59.851 --> 01:30:01.290
<v Speaker 2>Because you're giving them nutrients.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2072
01:30:01.291 --> 01:30:04.530
<v Speaker 2>you're giving too much fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>giving them too much sugar.</v>

2073
01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:06.690
<v Speaker 2>You're giving them too much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Starts scribbling.</v>

2074
01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:08.820
<v Speaker 2>You're giving a grain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're giving them something.</v>

2075
01:30:08.821 --> 01:30:13.821
<v Speaker 2>Their body doesn't want,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their body wants grass with a cow's </v>

2076
01:30:13.821 --> 01:30:14.130
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Naturally ease is just grass.</v>

2077
01:30:14.131 --> 01:30:19.131
<v Speaker 2>They graze and they just mountains out </v>
<v Speaker 2>there like towards like San Jose.</v>

2078
01:30:20.020 --> 01:30:21.990
<v Speaker 2>We just see them like Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead and go,</v>

2079
01:30:22.280 --> 01:30:23.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like somewhere nearby,</v>

2080
01:30:23.470 --> 01:30:28.470
<v Speaker 2>somewhere shade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they grain finish cow where </v>

2081
01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:29.640
<v Speaker 2>they'll feed them on grass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then before they butcher them,</v>

2082
01:30:29.641 --> 01:30:31.740
<v Speaker 2>they fatten them up with grain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So his whole life.</v>

2083
01:30:31.741 --> 01:30:34.260
<v Speaker 2>He grazes and then um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or she grazes.</v>

2084
01:30:34.490 --> 01:30:37.590
<v Speaker 2>So he mostly he steers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't eat meat.</v>

2085
01:30:37.830 --> 01:30:38.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do.</v>

2086
01:30:38.290 --> 01:30:43.290
<v Speaker 2>You do steers because I was just going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to say kind of sticks with those same </v>

2087
01:30:43.290 --> 01:30:43.290
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2088
01:30:43.290 --> 01:30:45.120
<v Speaker 2>Takes most of the time they're coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>from mail cows.</v>

2089
01:30:45.121 --> 01:30:50.121
<v Speaker 2>They're coming from steers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The female cows are very valuable for </v>

2090
01:30:50.121 --> 01:30:50.490
<v Speaker 2>their dairy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the male cows,</v>

2091
01:30:50.491 --> 01:30:53.490
<v Speaker 2>they cut their balls off and they turn </v>
<v Speaker 2>them into steers.</v>

2092
01:30:53.880 --> 01:30:54.980
<v Speaker 2>Can't really eat them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bull,</v>

2093
01:30:55.030 --> 01:31:00.030
<v Speaker 2>you can eat a bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but good fucking luck will never become </v>

2094
01:31:00.030 --> 01:31:01.740
<v Speaker 2>a real man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The steers are all Unix.</v>

2095
01:31:02.690 --> 01:31:05.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the only way you can control</v>

2096
01:31:05.311 --> 01:31:08.230
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't cook like,</v>

2097
01:31:08.430 --> 01:31:13.430
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good luck thinking that you're going to </v>

2098
01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:15.621
<v Speaker 2>be able to run a profitable business of </v>
<v Speaker 2>butchering bowls because they're not </v>

2099
01:31:15.631 --> 01:31:20.631
<v Speaker 2>gonna want to let anybody corral them in</v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere and control them and they're </v>

2100
01:31:20.631 --> 01:31:24.101
<v Speaker 2>gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna like you're gonna have to </v>

2101
01:31:24.101 --> 01:31:25.971
<v Speaker 2>take extra measures to keep them happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't go out into the yard filled </v>

2102
01:31:25.971 --> 01:31:26.660
<v Speaker 2>with bowls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2103
01:31:27.250 --> 01:31:29.430
<v Speaker 2>instead of it taking extra measures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've cut their dick off.</v>

2104
01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:34.600
<v Speaker 2>If I have to cut their balls off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of this stuff is still probably </v>

2105
01:31:34.600 --> 01:31:34.620
<v Speaker 2>can't be in there with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2106
01:31:34.770 --> 01:31:36.000
<v Speaker 2>they're giant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have to have a deck,</v>

2107
01:31:36.001 --> 01:31:36.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to pee.</v>

2108
01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:37.880
<v Speaker 2>Got To pee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pee.</v>

2109
01:31:38.120 --> 01:31:41.550
<v Speaker 2>It keeps giving them vagina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No cross dressing.</v>

2110
01:31:41.970 --> 01:31:44.820
<v Speaker 2>They eat the balls to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where rocks come from.</v>

2111
01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:46.620
<v Speaker 2>No people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cowboys.</v>

2112
01:31:46.670 --> 01:31:49.320
<v Speaker 2>Those are watching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what rocky mountain oysters are.</v>

2113
01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:51.990
<v Speaker 2>After they cut off the cows balls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2114
01:31:52.110 --> 01:31:53.670
<v Speaker 2>they cook them up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It dawned on him.</v>

2115
01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:55.140
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had both balls on Israel.</v>

2116
01:31:55.830 --> 01:31:57.030
<v Speaker 2>It's not bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a mixed grill.</v>

01:31:57.031 --> 01:31:58.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's nice and soft.</v>

2118
01:31:58.200 --> 01:31:59.980
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2119
01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:05.340
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a chef cooked like fear factor food and </v>

2120
01:32:05.340 --> 01:32:09.211
<v Speaker 2>that would be delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He prepared it well and so he did it </v>

2121
01:32:09.211 --> 01:32:10.990
<v Speaker 2>like with a with balls and did it with a</v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of different things.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I want to say that was on opiod Anthony.</v>

2123

<v Speaker 2>That they prepared it like that.</v>

2124
01:32:14.950 --> 01:32:16.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure it was on opie and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Anthony.</v>

2125
01:32:16.810 --> 01:32:20.020
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all become a blur.</v>

2126
01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:24.190
<v Speaker 2>Those fear factor interviews,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a bull's balls tastes like just meet</v>

2128
01:32:26.850 --> 01:32:28.120
<v Speaker 2>just like liver.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost to me.</v>

2129
01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:30.310
<v Speaker 2>Consistency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once you chop into it,</v>

2130

<v Speaker 2>the consistency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2131
01:32:31.930 --> 01:32:35.980
<v Speaker 2>It's a little more mushy than let </v>
<v Speaker 2>literally like a tenderloin or something</v>

2132
01:32:35.981 --> 01:32:38.590

<v Speaker 2>but chicken hearts are really good too.</v>

2133

<v Speaker 4>So it was great.</v>

2172
01:34:19.130 --> 01:34:23.611
<v Speaker 4>We doing commercials here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking Samsung commercial to get this </v>

2173
01:34:23.611 --> 01:34:26.320
<v Speaker 4>out to the sides.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Otherwise it meets stage with some beans</v>

2174
01:34:26.321 --> 01:34:27.390
<v Speaker 4>and some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some Broccoli.</v>

<v Speaker 4>We send in some fiber to open up the </v>
<v Speaker 4>poop shoot early.</v>

2176
01:34:31.750 --> 01:34:35.950
<v Speaker 4>Warm up for the poop poop comes behind </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

2177
01:34:36.010 --> 01:34:41.010
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever shot at a photo or Jessica</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maria and then gone back to eating a </v>

2178
01:34:41.010 --> 01:34:41.860
<v Speaker 4>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who have done that?</v>

2179
01:34:41.870 --> 01:34:44.950
<v Speaker 4>Brian created room for yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Last time I went there,</v>

2180
01:34:44.951 --> 01:34:49.951
<v Speaker 4>I actually decided that I was going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>take it slow instead of going really </v>

2181
01:34:49.951 --> 01:34:52.300
<v Speaker 4>fast and just eating as much as I spent </v>
<v Speaker 4>like two,</v>

2182
01:34:52.380 --> 01:34:54.580
<v Speaker 4>two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just really just hanging out,</v>

2183
01:34:54.581 --> 01:34:57.290
<v Speaker 4>getting to coffee and then going back to</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting me.</v>

2184
01:34:57.380 --> 01:34:57.990
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2185
01:34:58.010 --> 01:34:58.550
<v Speaker 3>like I just.</v>

2186
01:34:58.810 --> 01:35:00.850
<v Speaker 6>You're a nightmare customer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>

2187
01:35:00.890 --> 01:35:02.500

<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2188
01:35:02.501 --> 01:35:04.990
<v Speaker 6>it was just like an afternoon Sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's cool.</v>

2189
01:35:05.530 --> 01:35:10.530
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean if you're one of those people </v>

2190
01:35:10.530 --> 01:35:10.530
<v Speaker 6>that really wants to take advantage of </v>
<v Speaker 6>it,</v>

2191
01:35:10.530 --> 01:35:10.630

<v Speaker 6>I'm done in 10 minutes,</v>

2192
01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:14.440
<v Speaker 6>10 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>then I could probably quit.</v>

2193
01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:17.440
<v Speaker 6>There was one across the street from the</v>
<v Speaker 6>hotel and Cincinnati.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think think that costs the most money.</v>

2204
01:35:43.420 --> 01:35:48.420

<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2206
01:35:48.420 --> 01:35:49.520
<v Speaker 3>they're not stingy with anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Guys relaxed.</v>

2207
01:35:49.580 --> 01:35:51.910
<v Speaker 3>How come it takes a long time to cook </v>
<v Speaker 3>this shit?</v>

2208
01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:54.020
<v Speaker 3>A lot of people are eating.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not stingy.</v>

2209
01:35:54.021 --> 01:35:56.490
<v Speaker 3>It's all this dingy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more than once you.</v>

2210
01:35:56.740 --> 01:36:01.740
<v Speaker 3>So Julian it up right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The guy that put the little hot dogs </v>

2212
01:36:02.950 --> 01:36:06.880
<v Speaker 3>Anybody taking a Goddamn hot it because </v>
<v Speaker 3>they cook their own meals.</v>

2213
01:36:06.881 --> 01:36:11.470
<v Speaker 3>So he feels like he must be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's depressed one of the bunch.</v>

2214
01:36:11.650 --> 01:36:13.930
<v Speaker 3>He probably just gets no pussy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He probably goes home.</v>

2215
01:36:14.220 --> 01:36:16.230
<v Speaker 3>It could ask.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Diaz wants it like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>they'll cook that part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go back.</v>

2221

2222
01:36:26.030 --> 01:36:31.030
<v Speaker 6>So good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's such an awesome way of cooking </v>

2223
01:36:31.030 --> 01:36:33.451
<v Speaker 6>food.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They really have got it down to fake </v>

2224
01:36:33.451 --> 01:36:33.451
<v Speaker 6>after the show.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2225
01:36:33.451 --> 01:36:33.510
<v Speaker 6>the street.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2226
01:36:33.740 --> 01:36:34.870
<v Speaker 6>That's pretty good too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sure,</v>

2227
01:36:34.871 --> 01:36:36.340
<v Speaker 6>let's do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That place is fine.</v>

2228
01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:38.440
<v Speaker 6>I've got no problem with that place.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2229
01:36:38.441 --> 01:36:43.441
<v Speaker 6>that's a great way of ordering meat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a Brazilian steakhouse in the </v>

2230
01:36:43.441 --> 01:36:47.521
<v Speaker 6>mall.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's fantastic that you just asked </v>

2231
01:36:47.521 --> 01:36:47.521
<v Speaker 6>them and they just pile it all up on </v>
<v Speaker 6>your.</v>

2232
01:36:47.521 --> 01:36:48.050
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're good.</v>

2233
01:36:48.070 --> 01:36:50.770
<v Speaker 6>It's not quite the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The joy of just like whatever I can eat.</v>

2234
01:36:51.370 --> 01:36:54.620
<v Speaker 6>It's definitely not quite,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's still pretty fucking sporty.</v>

2235
01:36:54.710 --> 01:36:55.510
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like it.</v>

2236
01:36:55.930 --> 01:36:56.500
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they just have that,</v>

2237
01:36:56.501 --> 01:37:01.501
<v Speaker 6>that mall.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But you took me to Brian and the Grove </v>

2238
01:37:01.501 --> 01:37:04.051
<v Speaker 6>has went to Glendale,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so when you see a big fat piece of </v>

2239
01:37:04.051 --> 01:37:04.600
<v Speaker 6>marbling on a steak,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's cooked perfectly.</v>

2240
01:37:04.630 --> 01:37:07.720
<v Speaker 6>It's so delicious,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's really not a healthy animal.</v>

2241
01:37:07.890 --> 01:37:10.930
<v Speaker 6>Oh wait to take us back,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like how did we get here?</v>

2242
01:37:11.310 --> 01:37:13.450
<v Speaker 6>That's where we started after the dots.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like it.</v>

2243
01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:18.000
<v Speaker 6>I had a fucking farmer on last week and </v>
<v Speaker 6>talked with them for three hours.</v>

2244
01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:19.410
<v Speaker 6>Real farmers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>real farmer.</v>

2245
01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:22.870
<v Speaker 6>This Guy Joel Salatin,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's famous for doing what he calls.</v>

2246
01:37:23.740 --> 01:37:24.630
<v Speaker 6>He calls it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2247
01:37:24.700 --> 01:37:27.550
<v Speaker 6>integrity,</v>
<v Speaker 6>meat and in integrity farms,</v>

2248
01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:29.020
<v Speaker 6>like the way he runs things,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they,</v>

2249
01:37:29.021 --> 01:37:33.190
<v Speaker 6>the animals live essentially like total </v>
<v Speaker 6>free range boobs.</v>

2250
01:37:33.191 --> 01:37:38.191
<v Speaker 6>The chickens around.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He has electric fences for the cows and </v>

2251
01:37:38.191 --> 01:37:40.951
<v Speaker 6>the pigs moves them to different areas </v>
<v Speaker 6>of the farm unless they just completely </v>

2252
01:37:40.951 --> 01:37:42.490
<v Speaker 6>roam free and rummage through the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like he's got.</v>

2253
01:37:42.491 --> 01:37:45.330
<v Speaker 6>Pigs are wild pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they're there.</v>

2254
01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:49.060
<v Speaker 6>They're domestic pigs rather.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But they behave some wild look like wild</v>

2255
01:37:49.061 --> 01:37:51.340
<v Speaker 6>pigs and a lot of ways,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like they're really fat,</v>

2256
01:37:51.341 --> 01:37:54.670
<v Speaker 6>but the muscles like really defined.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They have a darker tissue.</v>

2257
01:37:54.670 --> 01:37:56.880
<v Speaker 6>They're much animals.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Even about salmon.</v>

2258
01:37:56.910 --> 01:37:58.230
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>The pink coloring they get,</v>

2259
01:37:58.260 --> 01:38:00.210
<v Speaker 6>they get that in the wild.</v>
<v Speaker 6>In captivity.</v>

2260
01:38:00.270 --> 01:38:01.830
<v Speaker 6>They just add that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2261
01:38:01.831 --> 01:38:06.831
<v Speaker 6>The,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that coloring because we've agreed that </v>

2262
01:38:06.831 --> 01:38:06.831
<v Speaker 6>salmon should look like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>isn't that weird?</v>

2263
01:38:06.831 --> 01:38:07.620
<v Speaker 6>When you lose the coloring,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>

2264
01:38:07.621 --> 01:38:09.960
<v Speaker 6>that's something to do with your soul.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nah.</v>

2265
01:38:09.990 --> 01:38:10.800
<v Speaker 6>Something,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

2266
01:38:10.830 --> 01:38:12.540
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You did the coloring of it.</v>

2267
01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:16.740
<v Speaker 6>Does it have the same nutrients?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I wonder what it is if it's certain bugs</v>

2268
01:38:16.741 --> 01:38:20.530
<v Speaker 6>that they eat or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>certain shellfish or what it.</v>

2269
01:38:20.670 --> 01:38:24.120
<v Speaker 6>Let's find out what helps.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What makes a a Sam?</v>

2270
01:38:24.150 --> 01:38:26.190
<v Speaker 6>It seems weird that everybody just cool </v>
<v Speaker 6>with that.</v>

2271
01:38:26.250 --> 01:38:29.250
<v Speaker 6>What would be the right Google thing?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What makes us sam and less pink?</v>

2272
01:38:29.510 --> 01:38:32.160
<v Speaker 6>Hot Pink when say they die.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They die.</v>

2273
01:38:32.161 --> 01:38:32.970
<v Speaker 6>The Salmon.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2274
01:38:32.971 --> 01:38:35.370
<v Speaker 6>but in the wild they don't die in the </v>
<v Speaker 6>wild is just pink.</v>

2275
01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:36.400
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really?</v>

2276
01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:39.870
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>because I think it's like Disney when it</v>

2277
01:38:39.871 --> 01:38:41.360
<v Speaker 6>dies,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how old the fishes?</v>

2278
01:38:41.370 --> 01:38:42.530
<v Speaker 6>It gets wider,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like at least.</v>

2279
01:38:42.570 --> 01:38:44.280
<v Speaker 6>I think it probably loose now as it gets</v>
<v Speaker 6>older.</v>

2280
01:38:44.281 --> 01:38:45.000
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

2281
01:38:45.001 --> 01:38:46.380
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It still stays correct.</v>

2282
01:38:46.430 --> 01:38:51.430
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What happens is there's something that </v>

2283
01:38:51.601 --> 01:38:53.940
<v Speaker 6>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

2284
01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:55.320
<v Speaker 6>The amount of height.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2285
01:38:55.321 --> 01:38:58.650
<v Speaker 6>it's something about the protein pellets</v>

2408
01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:22.390

<v Speaker 4>they ever figured out how to get it off.</v>

2413
01:44:39.470 --> 01:44:44.120
<v Speaker 4>while looking at him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said maybe this is what his house is </v>

2414
01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:45.640
<v Speaker 4>decorated like you're really into modern</v>

<v Speaker 4>for the oddity of it all,</v>

<v Speaker 4>What does this story say about her?</v>

2463
01:46:36.130 --> 01:46:37.190
<v Speaker 10>Uh,</v>

2464
01:46:39.150 --> 01:46:43.840
<v Speaker 4>see a woman has turned silver.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Warren's it's hard to tell him that.</v>

2465
01:46:43.841 --> 01:46:45.610
<v Speaker 4>Hard to tell because it will be dim </v>
<v Speaker 4>lighting.</v>

2466
01:46:45.660 --> 01:46:49.530
<v Speaker 4>So it was a tough color to pick up our </v>

2471
01:46:59.631 --> 01:47:00.420
<v Speaker 8>containing the metal from nosedive</v>

2477
01:47:11.251 --> 01:47:12.690
<v Speaker 6>silver?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think they have to approve it.</v>

2478
01:47:12.770 --> 01:47:14.310
<v Speaker 6>If it's an APP,</v>

<v Speaker 6>have.</v>

2485
01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:29.430
<v Speaker 6>It wasn't that way would that is in this</v>
<v Speaker 6>guys.</v>

2486
01:47:29.460 --> 01:47:34.460
<v Speaker 6>God is totally the colloidal silver.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You'll actually make it like he put the </v>

2487
01:47:34.460 --> 01:47:39.090
<v Speaker 6>silver pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You put it in like water and you add </v>

2488
01:47:39.090 --> 01:47:40.170
<v Speaker 6>some sort of electric current used to do</v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

2489
01:47:40.171 --> 01:47:42.270
<v Speaker 6>My friend Demetrius take chloral silver.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2490
01:47:42.540 --> 01:47:43.950
<v Speaker 6>They used to believe in him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If he got sick.</v>

2491
01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:49.760
<v Speaker 6>My friend Pete,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a smoked a gold blunt wrappers are </v>

2492
01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:50.020
<v Speaker 6>selling gold blunts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Actual gold.</v>

2493
01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:54.000
<v Speaker 6>Gold is the weirdest thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of people don't realize,</v>

2494
01:47:54.190 --> 01:47:57.180
<v Speaker 6>so it was a very smooth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can take a piece of gold,</v>

2495
01:47:57.510 --> 01:48:00.600
<v Speaker 6>like a little tiny piece of goal and you</v>
<v Speaker 6>can cover something as big as this whole</v>

2496
01:48:00.601 --> 01:48:05.601
<v Speaker 6>desk with it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which because it could be so malleable </v>

2497
01:48:05.601 --> 01:48:05.601
<v Speaker 6>to so thin,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it gets so thin.</v>

2498
01:48:05.601 --> 01:48:06.420
<v Speaker 6>It has really bizarre properties.</v>

2499
01:48:06.420 --> 01:48:09.960
<v Speaker 6>Almost alien like properties because </v>
<v Speaker 6>there's no other metal that exhibits the</v>

2500
01:48:09.961 --> 01:48:14.961
<v Speaker 6>same as the old alien spaceships.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The goldmines I'm told or it was where </v>

2501
01:48:15.901 --> 01:48:18.740
<v Speaker 6>the old alien spaceships ones of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>earth and just created this.</v>

2502
01:48:19.020 --> 01:48:21.210
<v Speaker 6>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it's just an unusual mineral.</v>

2503
01:48:21.400 --> 01:48:26.400
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean we know it's a similar to a lot </v>

2504
01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:27.780
<v Speaker 6>of other ones.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It just has an incredible property,</v>

2505
01:48:27.781 --> 01:48:30.120
<v Speaker 6>like the ability to spread and coat </v>
<v Speaker 6>things.</v>

2506
01:48:30.270 --> 01:48:31.870
<v Speaker 6>Good conductor to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Cool.</v>

2507
01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:33.610
<v Speaker 6>Well that's her blue check.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No,</v>

2508
01:48:33.620 --> 01:48:34.210
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's,</v>

2509
01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:39.500
<v Speaker 6>that's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I do like to pink and blue hair </v>

2510
01:48:39.500 --> 01:48:39.500
<v Speaker 6>though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I see what you're saying though.</v>

2511
01:48:39.500 --> 01:48:39.500
<v Speaker 6>Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We lived in.</v>

2512
01:48:39.500 --> 01:48:40.890
<v Speaker 6>The lights were off.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If that wouldn't be a problem at all.</v>

2513
01:48:41.070 --> 01:48:46.070
<v Speaker 8>Getting tattoos though and getting those</v>
<v Speaker 8>big hoop earrings and fucking their </v>

2514
01:48:46.070 --> 01:48:46.310
<v Speaker 8>faces up anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Why don't they just drink the silver and</v>

2515
01:48:46.480 --> 01:48:48.710
<v Speaker 8>blue skin?</v>
<v Speaker 8>That'd be pretty cool to be a unique.</v>

2516
01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:49.160
<v Speaker 8>Different.</v>

2517
01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:52.620
<v Speaker 6>Definitely easier than getting your </v>
<v Speaker 6>whole body tattooed,</v>

2518
01:48:52.630 --> 01:48:55.350
<v Speaker 6>so it was for a little while.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you get it for a year or something,</v>

2519
01:48:56.370 --> 01:48:56.930
<v Speaker 6>you know people.</v>

2520
01:48:56.970 --> 01:49:01.970
<v Speaker 8>What's.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The tattoos are forever and these girls </v>

2521
01:49:01.970 --> 01:49:01.970
<v Speaker 8>are getting face tattoos.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I say Walmart on it</v>

2522
01:49:01.970 --> 01:49:05.970
<v Speaker 6>just forever.</v>
<v Speaker 6>No one's getting face tattoos and say </v>

2523
01:49:05.970 --> 01:49:08.381
<v Speaker 6>Walmart and Walmart.</v>
<v Speaker 6>These people say no one really looked it</v>

2524
01:49:11.271 --> 01:49:11.810
<v Speaker 6>up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

2525
01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:16.880
<v Speaker 6>I would love that woman who at a </v>
<v Speaker 6>gambling casino tattooed on her </v>

2526
01:49:18.501 --> 01:49:20.940
<v Speaker 6>forehead.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just gambling casino or the name of this</v>

2527
01:49:21.070 --> 01:49:24.620

2528
01:49:24.621 --> 01:49:25.940
<v Speaker 6>forehead.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They gave her a certain amount of money.</v>

2529
01:49:26.150 --> 01:49:28.040
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think it was one of those things where</v>

2530
01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:31.580
<v Speaker 6>anybody who's willing to get it tattooed</v>
<v Speaker 6>on their head get like extra money.</v>

2531
01:49:31.750 --> 01:49:33.290
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They used to put it on fighters.</v>

2532

<v Speaker 6>the Henna.</v>

2534
01:49:36.860 --> 01:49:41.860
<v Speaker 6>They used to use to use like a magic </v>
<v Speaker 6>marker and it would draw it on people's </v>

2535
01:49:41.860 --> 01:49:45.041
<v Speaker 6>backs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you remember know whether you'd use </v>

2536
01:49:45.041 --> 01:49:45.041
<v Speaker 6>body paint or something like that?</v>
<v Speaker 6>On the fighters,</v>

2537
01:49:45.440 --> 01:49:47.930
<v Speaker 6>they did it with MMA fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like uh,</v>

2538
01:49:47.950 --> 01:49:48.220
<v Speaker 6>one</v>

2539
01:49:48.220 --> 01:49:51.550
<v Speaker 2>of the guys a Rico Rodriguez.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did it to him before he fought in the</v>

2540
01:49:51.551 --> 01:49:56.330
<v Speaker 2>UFC and he got in trouble for it because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was looking at this Walmart,</v>

2541
01:49:56.760 --> 01:50:00.820
<v Speaker 2>Walmart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 2>joke.</v>

2543
01:50:04.031 --> 01:50:07.270
<v Speaker 2>I like it as Walmart tattooed on his </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of like ears.</v>

2544
01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:11.520

<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

2545
01:50:11.580 --> 01:50:16.580
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Photos off is not the way the girl is a </v>

2546
01:50:16.580 --> 01:50:17.180
<v Speaker 2>probably a hipster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2547
01:50:17.620 --> 01:50:19.720
<v Speaker 2>What'd you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you say stretch marks on her side,</v>

2548
01:50:19.721 --> 01:50:24.721
<v Speaker 2>but still in shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how you got to have those </v>

2549
01:50:24.721 --> 01:50:25.930
<v Speaker 2>go off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fall off.</v>

2550
01:50:26.380 --> 01:50:28.330
<v Speaker 2>Fall off the wagon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

2551
01:50:28.660 --> 01:50:30.820
<v Speaker 2>Do you worry about letting your kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch certain things on TV?</v>

2552
01:50:30.970 --> 01:50:31.960
<v Speaker 2>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2553
01:50:32.470 --> 01:50:37.470
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want them to watch too much </v>

2554
01:50:37.470 --> 01:50:39.241
<v Speaker 2>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they've walked in during the UFC </v>

2555
01:50:39.241 --> 01:50:41.431
<v Speaker 2>fight before and sat down to cuddle with</v>
<v Speaker 2>me and that real confused as to what's </v>

2556
01:50:41.431 --> 01:50:41.431
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>

2557
01:50:41.431 --> 01:50:46.010
<v Speaker 2>Like one guy was getting fucked up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there was blood pouring down his head </v>

2558
01:50:46.010 --> 01:50:47.830
<v Speaker 2>and I had to decide like how to react to</v>
<v Speaker 2>this when she's watching this,</v>

2559
01:50:47.831 --> 01:50:49.210
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to be like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she's like,</v>

2560
01:50:49.450 --> 01:50:51.640
<v Speaker 2>why is there all this cut?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is all this blood?</v>

2561
01:50:51.641 --> 01:50:52.240
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh honey,</v>

2562
01:50:52.241 --> 01:50:53.980
<v Speaker 2>he got hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got hit.</v>

2563
01:50:53.981 --> 01:50:54.970
<v Speaker 2>Why did he get hit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I go,</v>

2564
01:50:54.971 --> 01:50:55.960
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a fight.</v>

2565
01:50:56.380 --> 01:50:58.870
<v Speaker 2>And sometimes when you're fighting you </v>
<v Speaker 2>get hit.</v>

2566
01:50:58.871 --> 01:50:59.980
<v Speaker 2>Is he hurt?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

2567
01:51:00.010 --> 01:51:02.290
<v Speaker 2>he's done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's going to be okay.</v>

2568
01:51:02.380 --> 01:51:03.520
<v Speaker 2>He's going to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2569
01:51:03.521 --> 01:51:05.620
<v Speaker 2>he's going to be okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But why did he get hurt?</v>

2570
01:51:05.800 --> 01:51:10.800
<v Speaker 2>He got hurt because he's doing mma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's MMA and amaze the UFC was the </v>

2571
01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:15.631
<v Speaker 2>UFC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>UFC is mixed martial arts and you know </v>

2572
01:51:15.631 --> 01:51:15.631
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey listen,</v>

2573
01:51:15.631 --> 01:51:19.771
<v Speaker 2>we can't have these conversations </v>
<v Speaker 2>because I want to watch going on and </v>

2574
01:51:19.771 --> 01:51:20.050
<v Speaker 2>it's already an exciting morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's important shit.</v>

2575
01:51:20.740 --> 01:51:21.890
<v Speaker 2>But it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2576
01:51:21.930 --> 01:51:23.020
<v Speaker 2>was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mommy,</v>

2577
01:51:23.110 --> 01:51:26.510
<v Speaker 2>go talk to mommy on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>baby.</v>

2578
01:51:28.660 --> 01:51:33.660
<v Speaker 2>What happened was I was watching it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't home and so when they came </v>

2579
01:51:33.660 --> 01:51:33.660
<v Speaker 2>home they ran into the room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>

2580
01:51:33.660 --> 01:51:38.400
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't shut it off and it was </v>

2581
01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:41.401
<v Speaker 2>already in the middle of a fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was one of those things where I </v>

2582
01:51:41.401 --> 01:51:41.401
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2583
01:51:41.401 --> 01:51:41.740
<v Speaker 2>you guys probably shouldn't be watching </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

2584
01:51:42.040 --> 01:51:43.650
<v Speaker 2>But they didn't freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead,</v>

2585
01:51:44.030 --> 01:51:47.260
<v Speaker 2>get your ppe on dancing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't freak out.</v>

2586
01:51:47.290 --> 01:51:48.160
<v Speaker 2>That's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't freak out.</v>

2587
01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:53.960
<v Speaker 2>They didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've never freaked out when they saw </v>

2588
01:51:53.960 --> 01:51:55.681
<v Speaker 2>hunting shows either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it hasn't taken anything away from </v>

2589
01:51:55.681 --> 01:51:55.681
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think.</v>

2590
01:51:55.681 --> 01:51:57.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to expose them to any,</v>

2591
01:51:57.580 --> 01:52:00.220
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any real violence though,</v>

2592
01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:04.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even even mma is probably too much for a</v>

2593
01:52:04.421 --> 01:52:08.200
<v Speaker 2>five year old kid to say walk in and see</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy getting ground and pounded.</v>

2594
01:52:08.250 --> 01:52:10.700
<v Speaker 2>It's just something like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want that.</v>

2595
01:52:10.800 --> 01:52:12.870
<v Speaker 8>Do you want them to get into mma when </v>
<v Speaker 8>they grow older?</v>

2596
01:52:12.900 --> 01:52:15.450
<v Speaker 8>Would you like them to get into Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 8>and all that stuff?</v>

2597
01:52:15.820 --> 01:52:19.390
<v Speaker 2>I think that people should do what they </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to do.</v>

2598
01:52:19.480 --> 01:52:24.480
<v Speaker 2>And I think if that's something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes something that they think is </v>

2599
01:52:24.480 --> 01:52:28.021
<v Speaker 2>exciting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they think that a nma looks like it </v>

2600
01:52:28.021 --> 01:52:28.021
<v Speaker 2>will be fun or Jujitsu looks like it'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>be fun.</v>

2601
01:52:28.021 --> 01:52:28.960
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2602
01:52:28.961 --> 01:52:30.280
<v Speaker 2>they should do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't.</v>

2603
01:52:30.281 --> 01:52:32.230
<v Speaker 2>And they think that something else looks</v>
<v Speaker 2>fun.</v>

2604
01:52:32.440 --> 01:52:33.610
<v Speaker 2>They should do that too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2605
01:52:33.611 --> 01:52:34.840
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I teach them things.</v>

2606
01:52:35.050 --> 01:52:36.370
<v Speaker 2>I've already started teaching them.</v>

2607
01:52:36.510 --> 01:52:41.510
<v Speaker 8>I think it must be hard for a girl to do</v>
<v Speaker 8>something like Jujitsu because I know </v>

2608
01:52:41.510 --> 01:52:42.720
<v Speaker 8>talking to a couple girls I know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>didn't you just so that they're like,</v>

2609
01:52:42.750 --> 01:52:44.890
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you run into the guys to have the boners</v>

2610
01:52:45.020 --> 01:52:45.690
<v Speaker 8>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you think they're,</v>

2611
01:52:45.691 --> 01:52:46.310
<v Speaker 8>they're just</v>

2612
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:49.250
<v Speaker 2>like trying to grind their dicks on you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and stuff like that.</v>

2613
01:52:49.570 --> 01:52:54.570
<v Speaker 2>There's was going to be done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's way harder for a chick to finish </v>

2614
01:52:54.570 --> 01:52:55.180
<v Speaker 2>for a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's way harder for them,</v>

2615
01:52:55.230 --> 01:52:58.250
<v Speaker 6>girl to find good training partners.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Too much less,</v>

2616
01:52:58.260 --> 01:53:00.510
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>less women do it.</v>

2617
01:53:00.660 --> 01:53:04.320
<v Speaker 6>So a woman who like grinds it out and </v>
<v Speaker 6>becomes purple belt,</v>

2618
01:53:04.590 --> 01:53:05.910
<v Speaker 6>Brown belt,</v>
<v Speaker 6>black belt,</v>

2619
01:53:05.940 --> 01:53:08.400
<v Speaker 6>like those women are bad ass man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That takes,</v>

2620
01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:13.680
<v Speaker 6>you've got to be a special type of chick</v>
<v Speaker 6>to gut it out and become like a Jujitsu </v>

2621
01:53:13.680 --> 01:53:14.040
<v Speaker 6>brown belt,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jujitsu,</v>

2622
01:53:14.041 --> 01:53:15.170
<v Speaker 6>black belt,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2623
01:53:15.430 --> 01:53:19.100
<v Speaker 6>to become like a real world class.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like Rhonda Rousey type Black Belt,</v>

2624
01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:20.910
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>she's a judo black belt,</v>

2625
01:53:20.911 --> 01:53:23.760
<v Speaker 6>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>same sort of thing to get to that level,</v>

2626
01:53:23.761 --> 01:53:25.650
<v Speaker 6>man,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you got to be something really special.</v>

2627
01:53:25.800 --> 01:53:30.800
<v Speaker 6>You really do.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You've got to have something that just </v>

2628
01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:32.631
<v Speaker 6>pushes you past everybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like when you see women and women that </v>

2629
01:53:32.631 --> 01:53:34.170
<v Speaker 6>fight in the UFC and they have a jujitsu</v>
<v Speaker 6>black belts,</v>

2630
01:53:34.171 --> 01:53:38.580
<v Speaker 6>like God damn woman that has a Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Black belt is a rare thing.</v>

2631
01:53:38.640 --> 01:53:43.530
<v Speaker 6>It was a bunch of them now,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but still much more rare than male black</v>

2632
01:53:43.531 --> 01:53:45.300
<v Speaker 6>belts.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Male black belts are everywhere.</v>

2633
01:53:45.510 --> 01:53:46.980
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what the numbers are,</v>

2634
01:53:47.010 --> 01:53:50.800
<v Speaker 6>but I'd have to say it's gotta be like </v>
<v Speaker 6>10 to one or something like that.</v>

2635
01:53:52.580 --> 01:53:53.410
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>

2636
01:53:53.411 --> 01:53:56.400
<v Speaker 6>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I might be totally incorrect,</v>

2637
01:53:56.401 --> 01:54:01.401
<v Speaker 6>but I would,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I would expect it would be somewhere </v>

2638
01:54:01.401 --> 01:54:03.040
<v Speaker 6>around that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think he does know.</v>

2639
01:54:03.560 --> 01:54:06.120
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but there's a,</v>

2640
01:54:06.360 --> 01:54:07.860
<v Speaker 6>there's some legit ones out there,</v>
<v Speaker 6>man.</v>

2641
01:54:07.861 --> 01:54:09.420
<v Speaker 6>I'll tell you that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's for fucking sure.</v>

2642
01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:11.730
<v Speaker 6>How many of them are lesbians?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

2643
01:54:11.731 --> 01:54:13.440
<v Speaker 6>Why don't you ask them Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whip your dick out.</v>

2644
01:54:16.650 --> 01:54:21.650
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was like a crazy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a girl saw guys,</v>

2645
01:54:22.480 --> 01:54:27.480
<v Speaker 2>Dick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like literally nature had made it so </v>

2646
01:54:27.480 --> 01:54:27.970
<v Speaker 2>that all you have to do is show someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>your deck.</v>

2647
01:54:27.971 --> 01:54:29.290
<v Speaker 2>Like as soon as we started covering it </v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

2648
01:54:29.680 --> 01:54:32.080
<v Speaker 2>nature made it so that if you have a guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>pulls his dick out,</v>

2649
01:54:32.270 --> 01:54:34.960
<v Speaker 2>like there could be like a room full of </v>
<v Speaker 2>women.</v>

2650
01:54:34.961 --> 01:54:39.961
<v Speaker 2>They all dropped their needs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just start talking at like nature just </v>

2651
01:54:39.961 --> 01:54:43.321
<v Speaker 2>confused the shit out of you and so it </v>
<v Speaker 2>becomes illegal to whip your dick out </v>

2652
01:54:43.321 --> 01:54:43.880
<v Speaker 2>because it's like it's breaking the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rule.</v>

2653
01:54:44.350 --> 01:54:49.350
<v Speaker 2>It's like they would have no choice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't imagine how crazy society just </v>

2654
01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:53.020
<v Speaker 2>catch people sucking people off for no </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason.</v>

2655
01:54:53.021 --> 01:54:55.090
<v Speaker 2>Like what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He pulled it out.</v>

2656
01:54:55.270 --> 01:54:56.400
<v Speaker 2>Asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't pull.</v>

2657
01:54:56.401 --> 01:54:58.570
<v Speaker 2>You're to start with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You pull it out.</v>

2658
01:54:58.630 --> 01:54:59.790
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to give them a textbook.</v>

2659
01:55:00.550 --> 01:55:05.550
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's a reason we have laws that </v>

2660
01:55:05.550 --> 01:55:05.550
<v Speaker 2>would be the last people who lock people</v>
<v Speaker 2>out for Pomona,</v>

2661
01:55:05.550 --> 01:55:08.050
<v Speaker 2>Dick out in front of other people lives </v>
<v Speaker 2>plain about it.</v>

2662
01:55:08.830 --> 01:55:10.480
<v Speaker 2>Why we stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's our natural.</v>

2663
01:55:10.750 --> 01:55:12.300
<v Speaker 2>It sounds ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sodas,</v>

2664
01:55:12.310 --> 01:55:15.730
<v Speaker 2>like almost all the weird shit like </v>
<v Speaker 2>having to go to sleep.</v>

2665
01:55:15.790 --> 01:55:20.790
<v Speaker 2>That sounds ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that every night you have to close your </v>

2666
01:55:20.790 --> 01:55:23.320
<v Speaker 2>eyes and the thing stops and it goes </v>
<v Speaker 2>into some crazy land where your eyes are</v>

2667
01:55:23.321 --> 01:55:28.120
<v Speaker 2>moving around back and forth inside your</v>
<v Speaker 2>head and you're fucking pastoral flying.</v>

2668
01:55:28.270 --> 01:55:33.270
<v Speaker 2>That's just way weirder than you pull </v>
<v Speaker 2>your dick out and people just start </v>

2669
01:55:33.270 --> 01:55:33.270
<v Speaker 2>socking it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

2670
01:55:33.630 --> 01:55:38.080
<v Speaker 2>It's a real thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're downloading some shit.</v>

2671
01:55:38.650 --> 01:55:39.460
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're tripping.</v>

2672
01:55:40.030 --> 01:55:42.130
<v Speaker 6>That's what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're tripping your balls off.</v>

2673
01:55:42.340 --> 01:55:44.130
<v Speaker 6>I balls back forth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're pretty</v>

2674
01:55:44.130 --> 01:55:47.070
<v Speaker 2>sure that what's going on in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to measure it,</v>

2675
01:55:47.310 --> 01:55:52.310
<v Speaker 2>but they're pretty sure what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>is dimethyltryptamine that there's a </v>

2676
01:55:52.310 --> 01:55:53.880
<v Speaker 2>release some form when you wake up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>goes out real quick.</v>

2677
01:55:53.881 --> 01:55:55.320
<v Speaker 2>It just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2678
01:55:55.321 --> 01:55:58.230
<v Speaker 2>I'm fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know now that a rat's produce it in</v>

2679
01:55:58.231 --> 01:56:03.231
<v Speaker 2>their brains while they're alive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pineal gland of the rat's brain </v>

2680
01:56:03.231 --> 01:56:06.411
<v Speaker 2>producers this dimethyltryptamine and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're pretty sure that it produces it </v>

2681
01:56:06.411 --> 01:56:08.910
<v Speaker 2>in high doses during periods of stress </v>
<v Speaker 2>or during,</v>

2682
01:56:09.020 --> 01:56:10.860
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during rem sleep.</v>

2683
01:56:11.100 --> 01:56:14.730
<v Speaker 2>Extreme stress where you think body </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinks it's going to die in Rem sleep or</v>

2684
01:56:14.731 --> 01:56:19.410
<v Speaker 2>two times where it just floods you with </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and they don't know how to measure it</v>

2685
01:56:19.500 --> 01:56:22.230
<v Speaker 2>in the dream state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how to get reps,</v>

2686
01:56:22.710 --> 01:56:24.990
<v Speaker 2>trying to work on figuring out how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>measure that.</v>

2687
01:56:25.500 --> 01:56:27.160
<v Speaker 2>Because to measure it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2688
01:56:27.290 --> 01:56:32.290
<v Speaker 2>it's really difficult to run these kinds</v>
<v Speaker 2>of studies because it's a schedule one </v>

2689
01:56:32.290 --> 01:56:36.801
<v Speaker 2>drug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also something that your body </v>

2690
01:56:36.801 --> 01:56:36.801
<v Speaker 2>produces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's real weird.</v>

2691
01:56:36.801 --> 01:56:37.020
<v Speaker 2>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2692
01:56:37.230 --> 01:56:40.920
<v Speaker 2>you're monitoring schedule one drugs and</v>
<v Speaker 2>their appearance in the body.</v>

2693
01:56:40.940 --> 01:56:43.650
<v Speaker 2>What testosterone in your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they ready to register.</v>

2694
01:56:43.860 --> 01:56:44.910
<v Speaker 2>Regulate that too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2695
01:56:45.390 --> 01:56:47.990
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But texts testosterone,</v>

2696
01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:48.730
<v Speaker 2>illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2697
01:56:48.760 --> 01:56:53.580
<v Speaker 2>It's not illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get it prescribed what the issue</v>

2698
01:56:53.581 --> 01:56:58.581
<v Speaker 2>is with a dimethyltryptamine is that so </v>
<v Speaker 2>prevalent on I got to do it at some </v>

2699
01:56:58.581 --> 01:57:00.810
<v Speaker 2>point you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so goddamn prevalent.</v>

2700
01:57:01.170 --> 01:57:06.170
<v Speaker 2>You've never done it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brent or you have not done it and you </v>

2701
01:57:06.170 --> 01:57:06.170
<v Speaker 2>don't think I should do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why not?</v>

2702
01:57:06.170 --> 01:57:06.660
<v Speaker 2>Don't listen to him ever</v>

2703
01:57:07.010 --> 01:57:07.540
<v Speaker 3>personal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2704
01:57:07.850 --> 01:57:10.890
<v Speaker 3>he didn't like the Salvia thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the Salvia thing.</v>

2705
01:57:10.950 --> 01:57:12.510
<v Speaker 3>I keep saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love that.</v>

2706
01:57:12.870 --> 01:57:14.790
<v Speaker 3>It just looked weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so mad at me.</v>

2707
01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:20.760
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were fucking with him while he was </v>

2708
01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:20.760
<v Speaker 3>tripping.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Watched it.</v>

2709
01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:22.730
<v Speaker 3>What were you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You were just being totally silent.</v>

2710
01:57:24.220 --> 01:57:24.960
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was.</v>

2711
01:57:25.030 --> 01:57:30.030
<v Speaker 3>I was hosting a podcast and then trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to get some stuff out of it and,</v>

2712
01:57:31.080 --> 01:57:34.140
<v Speaker 3>and I didn't know he was that fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just like having fun.</v>

2713
01:57:34.141 --> 01:57:36.060
<v Speaker 3>But then once I noticed it he was really</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked up.</v>

2714
01:57:36.090 --> 01:57:41.090
<v Speaker 3>Then I tried to make him not stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're already the devil so you fucking </v>

2715
01:57:41.090 --> 01:57:42.630
<v Speaker 3>with him until you realize he was fucked</v>
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

2716
01:57:42.660 --> 01:57:43.890
<v Speaker 3>We stopped fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2717
01:57:43.891 --> 01:57:48.891
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were doing a podcast was when you </v>

2718
01:57:48.891 --> 01:57:50.451
<v Speaker 3>come out of that thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it looks like you're better on your </v>

2719
01:57:50.451 --> 01:57:50.451

<v Speaker 3>It's tricky that it escaped all the </v>

2726
01:58:09.200 --> 01:58:11.760
<v Speaker 3>regulations.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you need a spotter to do dmt.</v>

2743
01:58:47.321 --> 01:58:49.480
<v Speaker 6>but when everyone's clear on each </v>
<v Speaker 6>other's intention.</v>

2744
01:58:50.160 --> 01:58:52.180
<v Speaker 6>I love lighting.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Trying to give me a massage.</v>

2745
01:58:52.270 --> 01:58:53.350
<v Speaker 6>Look really tense.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

2746
01:58:53.980 --> 01:58:58.200
<v Speaker 6>what's going on with the candles </v>
<v Speaker 6>scented?</v>

2747
01:58:59.730 --> 01:59:04.060
<v Speaker 6>I make them crushed my own roses.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I make my own candles.</v>

2748
01:59:04.510 --> 01:59:08.020
<v Speaker 6>I lovingly put them together and I would</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you to have to keep it by your bed.</v>

2749
01:59:10.120 --> 01:59:11.680
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's something about candles,</v>

2750
01:59:11.860 --> 01:59:13.100
<v Speaker 6>so don't have the candles.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you're gonna,</v>

2751
01:59:13.120 --> 01:59:14.870
<v Speaker 6>do DMT by yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't want to let your house.</v>

2752
01:59:14.871 --> 01:59:17.490
<v Speaker 6>I'm just have a spotter for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you can have a spotter house.</v>

2753
01:59:17.560 --> 01:59:19.780
<v Speaker 6>Barbara spotters getting away.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes it's like,</v>

2754
01:59:19.781 --> 01:59:24.781
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I need to do this and then you got to </v>

2755
01:59:24.781 --> 01:59:24.781
<v Speaker 6>have some for them to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2756
01:59:24.781 --> 01:59:24.781
<v Speaker 6>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sometimes they like interrupt.</v>

2757
01:59:24.781 --> 01:59:27.520
<v Speaker 6>I'd want to be alone and just have my </v>
<v Speaker 6>experience completely.</v>

2758
01:59:27.521 --> 01:59:31.000
<v Speaker 6>Eddie Bravo starts snoring.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He fucked up my trip.</v>

2759
01:59:31.001 --> 01:59:32.820
<v Speaker 6>I was on.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was right beside him.</v>

2760
01:59:32.840 --> 01:59:35.620
<v Speaker 6>He was snoring.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I heard him snoring and I had to wake up</v>

2761
01:59:35.621 --> 01:59:36.670
<v Speaker 6>in the middle of the trip.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Go Eddie,</v>

2762
01:59:36.671 --> 01:59:38.450
<v Speaker 6>wake up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're fucking snoring.</v>

2763
01:59:38.520 --> 01:59:41.140
<v Speaker 6>He was spotting or he was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He's supposed to be.</v>

2764
01:59:41.770 --> 01:59:43.750
<v Speaker 6>He just took a nap.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It was like you were gone for so long.</v>

2765
01:59:43.751 --> 01:59:44.220
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what?</v>

2766
01:59:44.330 --> 01:59:46.060
<v Speaker 6>Said it's a 10 minute trip.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It is.</v>

2767
01:59:46.220 --> 01:59:47.620
<v Speaker 6>He took a nap,</v>
<v Speaker 6>take a nap.</v>

2768
01:59:48.280 --> 01:59:49.120
<v Speaker 6>He couldn't wait.</v>

2769
01:59:49.400 --> 01:59:52.850
<v Speaker 8>If you have any existing schizophrenia </v>
<v Speaker 8>or anything like that,</v>

2770
01:59:52.851 --> 01:59:54.480
<v Speaker 8>you might break your head open.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You might just.</v>

2771
01:59:55.830 --> 02:00:00.150
<v Speaker 6>That is the thing you struggle with an </v>
<v Speaker 6>ordinary reality you might not even know</v>

2772
02:00:00.151 --> 02:00:00.900
<v Speaker 6>about.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2773
02:00:00.901 --> 02:00:02.340
<v Speaker 6>You might not even.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

2774
02:00:02.341 --> 02:00:05.040
<v Speaker 6>there's a lot of people that are in </v>
<v Speaker 6>denial about their own mental illness,</v>

2775
02:00:05.430 --> 02:00:07.620
<v Speaker 6>but there are a lot of people that don't</v>
<v Speaker 6>know about it yet.</v>

2776
02:00:07.680 --> 02:00:09.390
<v Speaker 6>That's the only weird thing with those </v>
<v Speaker 6>things.</v>

2777
02:00:09.660 --> 02:00:11.310
<v Speaker 6>The people who would like suddenly it's </v>
<v Speaker 6>like boom,</v>

2778
02:00:11.400 --> 02:00:13.950
<v Speaker 6>you're turned wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2779
02:00:13.951 --> 02:00:18.951
<v Speaker 6>I wonder if that would have happened </v>
<v Speaker 6>anyway because people just become </v>

2780
02:00:18.951 --> 02:00:18.951
<v Speaker 6>schizophrenia.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know?</v>

2781
02:00:18.951 --> 02:00:23.330
<v Speaker 6>It's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know what the chain of events </v>

2782
02:00:23.330 --> 02:00:23.940
<v Speaker 6>that have to take place in order for </v>
<v Speaker 6>someone to go loony,</v>

2783
02:00:24.120 --> 02:00:29.120
<v Speaker 6>but I know that it's happened with and </v>
<v Speaker 6>without drugs and I don't know </v>

2784
02:00:29.120 --> 02:00:30.510
<v Speaker 6>necessarily the drug's fault.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's with some folks.</v>

2785
02:00:30.511 --> 02:00:35.511
<v Speaker 6>It could be though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Some folks have had a pretty hair </v>

2786
02:00:35.511 --> 02:00:39.291
<v Speaker 6>raising stories of not coming back </v>
<v Speaker 6>entirely and folks that they knew that </v>

2787
02:00:39.291 --> 02:00:41.880
<v Speaker 6>it didn't come back entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How setting off a schizophrenia episode.</v>

2788
02:00:41.910 --> 02:00:43.230
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've known a few people.</v>

2789
02:00:44.380 --> 02:00:44.690
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

2790
02:00:45.580 --> 02:00:46.590
<v Speaker 6>People that are vulnerable</v>

2791
02:00:46.710 --> 02:00:47.720
<v Speaker 8>never came back from.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>

<v Speaker 8>she never came back.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Dude.</v>

2793
02:00:49.090 --> 02:00:51.070
<v Speaker 8>I knew this one guy and don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 8>say it in college.</v>

2794
02:00:51.140 --> 02:00:56.140
<v Speaker 8>He used to just be the guy that would </v>
<v Speaker 8>always take 10 heads instead of a one </v>

2795
02:00:56.140 --> 02:00:56.140
<v Speaker 8>hit.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're like,</v>

2796
02:00:56.140 --> 02:00:56.140
<v Speaker 8>dude,</v>

<v Speaker 8>I'm taking attendance anyway.</v>

2798
02:00:57.580 --> 02:00:59.080

<v Speaker 8>It's constantly doing.</v>

2799
02:00:59.140 --> 02:01:01.750
<v Speaker 8>I stopped talking to him because it was </v>
<v Speaker 8>just like hanging out with our retired.</v>

2800
02:01:01.760 --> 02:01:03.150
<v Speaker 8>He became a hippie.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>

2801
02:01:03.220 --> 02:01:06.580
<v Speaker 8>And then I saw him like later,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like five years later,</v>

2802
02:01:06.700 --> 02:01:08.410
<v Speaker 8>and that dude was barely,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like,</v>

2803
02:01:08.411 --> 02:01:10.780
<v Speaker 8>he was not doing acid anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but he,</v>

2804
02:01:10.840 --> 02:01:15.040
<v Speaker 8>his brain was so god that it was like </v>
<v Speaker 8>talking to a dumb,</v>

2805
02:01:15.070 --> 02:01:17.950
<v Speaker 8>like a mentally retarded person.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>

2806
02:01:18.190 --> 02:01:18.910
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2807
02:01:18.940 --> 02:01:20.230
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's what they said happened.</v>

2808
02:01:20.231 --> 02:01:25.231
<v Speaker 6>And Ted Kaczynski,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like he was a part of the Harvard lsd </v>

2809
02:01:25.231 --> 02:01:26.110
<v Speaker 6>experiments.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They did.</v>

2810
02:01:26.680 --> 02:01:28.100
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they unlocked them.</v>

2811
02:01:28.200 --> 02:01:31.630
<v Speaker 6>Fringe cooked people with lsd while he </v>
<v Speaker 6>went.</v>

2812
02:01:31.660 --> 02:01:33.010
<v Speaker 6>When he went to,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

2813
02:01:33.370 --> 02:01:35.950
<v Speaker 6>I think he was teaching in the Pacific </v>
<v Speaker 6>Northwest,</v>

2814
02:01:35.951 --> 02:01:36.840
<v Speaker 6>I forget which,</v>
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>

2815
02:01:37.210 --> 02:01:39.800
<v Speaker 6>where he was teaching,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he went to,</v>

2816
02:01:39.801 --> 02:01:41.360
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>might have been San Francisco,</v>

2817
02:01:41.361 --> 02:01:43.550
<v Speaker 6>was at Berkeley,</v>
<v Speaker 6>might've been Berkeley.</v>

2818
02:01:43.760 --> 02:01:45.530
<v Speaker 6>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he went there.</v>

2819
02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:48.260
<v Speaker 6>He taught for a long enough period of </v>
<v Speaker 6>time.</v>

2820
02:01:48.320 --> 02:01:53.320
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He taught for a long enough period of </v>

2821
02:01:53.320 --> 02:01:53.960
<v Speaker 6>time that he could store up enough money</v>
<v Speaker 6>to buy a cabin and then start his attack</v>

2822
02:01:53.961 --> 02:01:58.961
<v Speaker 6>on technology.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So the guy buys this fucking little </v>

2823
02:01:58.961 --> 02:02:02.381
<v Speaker 6>piece of land and this little tiny cabin</v>
<v Speaker 6>and goes up there and decides to start </v>

2824
02:02:02.381 --> 02:02:04.790
<v Speaker 6>assassinating people who were involved </v>
<v Speaker 6>in the creation of technology.</v>

2825
02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:10.070
<v Speaker 6>And this all came about because of the </v>
<v Speaker 6>LSD studies where they dosed this guy to</v>

2826
02:02:10.071 --> 02:02:10.610
<v Speaker 6>the gills.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Super Genius Guy who decides to live in </v>
<v Speaker 6>the woods as a recluse and attack </v>

2859
02:03:30.610 --> 02:03:33.680
<v Speaker 6>civilization from the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Still going out there.</v>

2860
02:03:34.160 --> 02:03:37.280
<v Speaker 6>It's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think you ever get away with not</v>

2861
02:03:37.281 --> 02:03:40.370
<v Speaker 6>paying something.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't just pay off all your taxes.</v>

2862
02:03:40.700 --> 02:03:41.570
<v Speaker 6>You can't say,</v>
<v Speaker 6>hey look,</v>

2863
02:03:41.571 --> 02:03:43.670
<v Speaker 6>I'm going to give you guys a million </v>
<v Speaker 6>dollars 30 years.</v>

2864
02:03:43.680 --> 02:03:45.830
<v Speaker 6>This is for the next 30 years of </v>
<v Speaker 6>property taxes were gone.</v>

2865
02:03:45.831 --> 02:03:47.750
<v Speaker 6>We don't have to talk anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't do that.</v>

2866
02:03:47.751 --> 02:03:49.460
<v Speaker 6>I don't think they still take a piece of</v>
<v Speaker 6>you.</v>

2867
02:03:49.490 --> 02:03:52.910
<v Speaker 6>I think property taxes can change too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That can't ever be free.</v>

2868
02:03:52.940 --> 02:03:54.380
<v Speaker 6>You can't ever just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

2869
02:03:54.410 --> 02:03:56.540
<v Speaker 6>I got my little thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's true.</v>

2870
02:03:56.570 --> 02:03:58.520
<v Speaker 6>You can't ever be free.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's kind of gross in it.</v>

2871
02:03:58.640 --> 02:04:01.070
<v Speaker 6>Had D of property taxes just hit me what</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was and I was like,</v>

2872
02:04:01.071 --> 02:04:01.790
<v Speaker 6>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so you don't.</v>

2873
02:04:01.791 --> 02:04:03.170
<v Speaker 6>Even when you have something you don't </v>
<v Speaker 6>have it,</v>

2874
02:04:03.730 --> 02:04:05.480
<v Speaker 6>so if you don't pay it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they'll just take back your shit.</v>

2875
02:04:05.960 --> 02:04:08.750
<v Speaker 6>You're just renting then just renting </v>
<v Speaker 6>everywhere.</v>

2876
02:04:09.530 --> 02:04:11.230
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

2877
02:04:11.240 --> 02:04:14.690
<v Speaker 6>You're renting everywhere you go and </v>
<v Speaker 6>ultimately when you die,</v>

2878
02:04:14.691 --> 02:04:19.691
<v Speaker 6>if you don't pay that property tax,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that's the reason why they use to close </v>

2879
02:04:19.691 --> 02:04:20.270
<v Speaker 6>it on your state.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They take 30 percent of it,</v>

2880
02:04:20.271 --> 02:04:22.850
<v Speaker 6>40 percent of it between there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Every time you earned a dollar,</v>

2881
02:04:23.170 --> 02:04:26.330
<v Speaker 6>then they take eight to 10 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you spend that dollar and then when</v>

2882
02:04:26.331 --> 02:04:28.610
<v Speaker 6>you leave it to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 6>whatever the little you have left,</v>

2883
02:04:28.910 --> 02:04:31.070
<v Speaker 6>when you leave it to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a friend or a family member,</v>

2884
02:04:31.071 --> 02:04:33.410
<v Speaker 6>they take half of that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know that when they spend it,</v>

2885
02:04:33.420 --> 02:04:34.720
<v Speaker 6>they took 10 more percent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

2886
02:04:34.721 --> 02:04:38.340
<v Speaker 6>it's really legit though.</v>
<v Speaker 6>States that don't have state taxes.</v>

2887
02:04:38.610 --> 02:04:40.350
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you live in Seattle,</v>

2888
02:04:40.380 --> 02:04:43.620
<v Speaker 4>you're in Washington state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Delaware state taxes,</v>

2889
02:04:44.100 --> 02:04:46.020
<v Speaker 4>Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's quite a few.</v>

2890
02:04:46.021 --> 02:04:47.700
<v Speaker 4>Nevada,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nevada is a big one.</v>

2891
02:04:47.790 --> 02:04:49.530
<v Speaker 4>No state taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's big.</v>

2892
02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:53.400
<v Speaker 4>Really Nice that that's 10 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Vegas,</v>

2893
02:04:53.401 --> 02:04:55.980
<v Speaker 4>Nevada.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you want to have an ecstasy,</v>

2894
02:04:56.040 --> 02:04:57.900
<v Speaker 4>hooker overload,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's your spot.</v>

2895
02:04:58.170 --> 02:05:01.890
<v Speaker 4>You should go to fucking start your </v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast from the hard rock.</v>

2896
02:05:02.130 --> 02:05:07.130
<v Speaker 4>Whatever happened to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why aren't you guys doing podcasts from </v>

2897
02:05:07.130 --> 02:05:09.321
<v Speaker 4>there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do a podcast from there from whatever </v>

2898
02:05:09.321 --> 02:05:12.981
<v Speaker 4>it's called,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hangover or what's The Sunday thing </v>

2899
02:05:12.981 --> 02:05:13.020
<v Speaker 4>that they have?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their Rehab Rehab.</v>

2900
02:05:13.830 --> 02:05:18.830
<v Speaker 4>We did one episode and then I guess </v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody high up that owned the banks </v>

2901
02:05:18.830 --> 02:05:21.450
<v Speaker 4>that own the place or solid and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2902
02:05:21.451 --> 02:05:25.350
<v Speaker 4>we've been having so much problems with </v>
<v Speaker 4>other shows being on in there.</v>

2903
02:05:25.351 --> 02:05:27.990
<v Speaker 4>There was like some show that was a </v>
<v Speaker 4>reality show based there.</v>

2904
02:05:28.090 --> 02:05:33.090
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on the show they showed people like </v>

2905
02:05:33.090 --> 02:05:36.890
<v Speaker 4>doing cocaine and all this like hookers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit stuff and so I guess they got into </v>

2906
02:05:36.890 --> 02:05:40.920
<v Speaker 4>a lot of trouble for it and then so then</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we did our desk squad podcasts,</v>

2907
02:05:40.921 --> 02:05:45.450
<v Speaker 4>they're the bank saw the first episode </v>
<v Speaker 4>or heard about the first episode.</v>

2908
02:05:45.450 --> 02:05:46.050
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>

2909
02:05:46.051 --> 02:05:51.051
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're doing another reality show for a </v>

2910
02:05:51.051 --> 02:05:54.741
<v Speaker 4>guy that called desk squat and know is </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they accept it and then all these </v>

2911
02:05:54.741 --> 02:05:55.050
<v Speaker 4>people got fired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was hilarious.</v>

2912
02:05:56.610 --> 02:06:00.810
<v Speaker 4>I went there one time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my bed bug and I smoke cigars,</v>

2913
02:06:00.811 --> 02:06:05.811
<v Speaker 4>drank,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did some ecstasy and man I was having a </v>

2914
02:06:05.811 --> 02:06:05.970
<v Speaker 4>good time until we actually got on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>plane later and I was like,</v>

2915
02:06:05.971 --> 02:06:09.690
<v Speaker 4>this was a horrible mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I'm Vegas podcasts,</v>

2916
02:06:09.720 --> 02:06:12.600
<v Speaker 4>like a live vegas podcast could probably</v>
<v Speaker 4>be fucking crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>but do a live vegas podcast somewhere.</v>

2919
02:06:19.050 --> 02:06:20.820
<v Speaker 4>They'd have to be the right size venue </v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

2920
02:06:20.890 --> 02:06:23.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well you could have a legit podcast.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Is there anywhere in Vegas to go to go </v>
<v Speaker 4>out to party?</v>

<v Speaker 4>What did he say about aliens?</v>

2935
02:06:58.030 --> 02:06:58.830
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pretty sweet.</v>

2936
02:06:58.920 --> 02:07:00.300
<v Speaker 4>He was saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2937
02:07:00.330 --> 02:07:02.160
<v Speaker 4>we could play it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it took.</v>

2938
02:07:02.220 --> 02:07:04.710
<v Speaker 4>Really didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't say much.</v>

2939
02:07:04.860 --> 02:07:06.450
<v Speaker 4>What he said was that he went and </v>
<v Speaker 4>looked,</v>

2940
02:07:06.510 --> 02:07:08.160
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he first got into office,</v>

2941
02:07:08.161 --> 02:07:12.550
<v Speaker 4>he went and immediately went looking to </v>
<v Speaker 4>look into the friendly,</v>

2942
02:07:12.600 --> 02:07:15.660
<v Speaker 4>warm area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fifty one looking to Roswell crash,</v>

2943
02:07:15.661 --> 02:07:18.360
<v Speaker 4>look into all this different shit and </v>
<v Speaker 4>find out whatever he could.</v>

2944
02:07:18.361 --> 02:07:18.920
<v Speaker 4>That's cool.</v>

2945
02:07:18.990 --> 02:07:21.660
<v Speaker 4>And he said that if he did find alien,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she would tell us.</v>

2946
02:07:21.990 --> 02:07:22.440
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

2947
02:07:22.441 --> 02:07:23.280
<v Speaker 4>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yes,</v>

2948
02:07:23.281 --> 02:07:25.560
<v Speaker 4>I would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he said it and it seemed like he was</v>

2949
02:07:25.561 --> 02:07:27.570
<v Speaker 4>telling the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what does that mean?</v>

2950
02:07:28.050 --> 02:07:33.050
<v Speaker 4>I believe that when he sees a </v>
<v Speaker 4>charismatic relationships with that </v>

2951
02:07:33.050 --> 02:07:33.050
<v Speaker 4>woman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

<v Speaker 4>fucking cigar in her vagina.</v>

2953
02:07:35.620 --> 02:07:40.180
<v Speaker 4>I meant or whatever and it wasn't actual</v>
<v Speaker 4>sex and like we didn't have a baby.</v>

2954
02:07:40.240 --> 02:07:41.790
<v Speaker 4>I didn't come into La.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you weren't,</v>

2955
02:07:41.890 --> 02:07:44.290

<v Speaker 4>You didn't know God?</v>

2956
02:07:44.291 --> 02:07:47.890
<v Speaker 4>Not by my definition of the term.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not by my definition.</v>

2957
02:07:47.891 --> 02:07:49.510
<v Speaker 4>That's how he got out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forgot about that.</v>

2958
02:07:49.980 --> 02:07:51.010
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wow,</v>

2959
02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:53.410
<v Speaker 4>if he really knew about aliens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if he would tell us,</v>

2960
02:07:53.411 --> 02:07:54.790
<v Speaker 4>but he might.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's it got to lose now?</v>

2961
02:07:54.820 --> 02:07:59.820
<v Speaker 4>It's so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That would be the dopest thing to check </v>

2962
02:07:59.820 --> 02:08:02.311
<v Speaker 4>too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you've got an office just for </v>

2971
02:08:13.180 --> 02:08:16.350
<v Speaker 11>because I want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I'd want to know what has been going on.</v>

2972
02:08:16.420 --> 02:08:18.570
<v Speaker 11>They you do that sort of.</v>

2973
02:08:18.850 --> 02:08:20.900
<v Speaker 12>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 12>To get Jimmy Kimmel's</v>

2974
02:08:21.000 --> 02:08:23.200
<v Speaker 4>question you asked him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would want to find out about us.</v>

2975
02:08:23.290 --> 02:08:26.730
<v Speaker 11>So you're getting in my second term,</v>
<v Speaker 11>we had the anniversary of Roswell.</v>

2976
02:08:26.820 --> 02:08:28.440
<v Speaker 11>You waited that long.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I did.</v>

2977
02:08:30.090 --> 02:08:31.270
<v Speaker 11>Well I did.</v>
<v Speaker 11>And then I,</v>

2978
02:08:31.271 --> 02:08:36.271
<v Speaker 11>there's also area 51.</v>
<v Speaker 11>You remember there was a great Scifi </v>

2979
02:08:36.271 --> 02:08:38.110
<v Speaker 11>movie where there was an alien kept deep</v>
<v Speaker 11>under the ground area.</v>

2980
02:08:38.130 --> 02:08:43.130
<v Speaker 11>Fifty one.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So first I had people go look at the </v>

2981
02:08:43.130 --> 02:08:44.570
<v Speaker 11>records on area 51 to make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 11>there was no alien down there.</v>

2982
02:08:47.210 --> 02:08:52.210
<v Speaker 11>I bought that because everybody who </v>
<v Speaker 11>works there has to stop about an hour </v>

2983
02:08:52.400 --> 02:08:56.270
<v Speaker 11>away and put on special clothing and </v>
<v Speaker 11>then drive in and out.</v>

2984
02:08:56.271 --> 02:08:59.810
<v Speaker 11>And that's because a lot of our stealth </v>
<v Speaker 11>technology is made there.</v>

2985
02:08:59.811 --> 02:09:01.760
<v Speaker 11>We know that now and,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and,</v>

2986
02:09:02.270 --> 02:09:04.590
<v Speaker 11>but there are no aliens there.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So then,</v>

2987
02:09:04.600 --> 02:09:06.860
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>when the Roswell thing came up,</v>

2988
02:09:07.010 --> 02:09:08.360
<v Speaker 11>I knew we'd get,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

2989
02:09:08.730 --> 02:09:12.560
<v Speaker 11>the letters.</v>
<v Speaker 11>So I had all the Roswell papers reviewed</v>

2990
02:09:12.950 --> 02:09:16.700
<v Speaker 11>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 11>If you saw that there were aliens there,</v>

2991
02:09:16.701 --> 02:09:18.280
<v Speaker 11>would you tell us?</v>
<v Speaker 11>Yeah,</v>

2992
02:09:18.500 --> 02:09:23.500
<v Speaker 11>you would.</v>
<v Speaker 11>We know.</v>

2993
02:09:25.481 --> 02:09:28.300
<v Speaker 11>We know now we live in an ever expanding</v>
<v Speaker 11>universe.</v>

2994
02:09:28.301 --> 02:09:33.301
<v Speaker 11>We know that there are billions of stars</v>
<v Speaker 11>and planets literally out there and the </v>

2995
02:09:33.301 --> 02:09:38.161
<v Speaker 11>university is getting bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 11>We know from our fancy telescopes that </v>

2996
02:09:38.260 --> 02:09:42.640
<v Speaker 11>just in the last two years,</v>
<v Speaker 11>more than 20 planets had been identified</v>

2997
02:09:42.700 --> 02:09:47.700
<v Speaker 11>outside our solar system that seem to be</v>
<v Speaker 11>far enough away from their sons and </v>

2998
02:09:47.700 --> 02:09:51.730
<v Speaker 11>dense enough that they might be able to </v>
<v Speaker 11>support some form of live.</v>

2999
02:09:51.790 --> 02:09:55.960
<v Speaker 11>So it makes it increasingly less likely </v>
<v Speaker 11>that we're alone.</v>

3000
02:09:56.170 --> 02:09:57.190
<v Speaker 11>I want to get high with him yet.</v>

3001
02:09:57.230 --> 02:09:57.840
<v Speaker 12>And they,</v>

3002
02:10:01.140 --> 02:10:04.960
<v Speaker 11>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but if we were visited someday,</v>

3003
02:10:04.990 --> 02:10:07.750
<v Speaker 11>I wouldn't be surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I just hope that,</v>

3004
02:10:07.751 --> 02:10:10.780
<v Speaker 11>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>is not like independence day.</v>

3005
02:10:10.910 --> 02:10:11.630
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Right.</v>

3006
02:10:12.520 --> 02:10:13.630
<v Speaker 11>That it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

3007
02:10:13.631 --> 02:10:15.490
<v Speaker 11>a,</v>
<v Speaker 11>a conflict.</v>

3008
02:10:15.610 --> 02:10:19.420
<v Speaker 11>Well now we have maybe the other way to </v>
<v Speaker 11>unite this increasingly divided world of</v>

3009
02:10:19.421 --> 02:10:19.810
<v Speaker 11>ours.</v>

3010
02:10:21.670 --> 02:10:26.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He actually had the same point that </v>

3011
02:10:26.670 --> 02:10:28.351
<v Speaker 4>Reagan had.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember Reagan had that speech and he </v>

3012
02:10:28.351 --> 02:10:28.750
<v Speaker 4>talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I often wonder if we,</v>

3013
02:10:28.751 --> 02:10:33.751
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was talking about an invasion from </v>

3014
02:10:33.751 --> 02:10:34.160
<v Speaker 4>another planet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we were invaded by another</v>

3015
02:10:34.160 --> 02:10:39.160
<v Speaker 2>planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would that be enough to join America </v>

3016
02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:41.441
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>joined the world together rather and </v>

3017
02:10:41.441 --> 02:10:42.440
<v Speaker 2>making us realize that we're all in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

3018
02:10:42.770 --> 02:10:44.780
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that some will do with they</v>
<v Speaker 2>have aliens and we're like,</v>

3019
02:10:44.840 --> 02:10:47.460
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plan the tech make aliens.</v>

3020
02:10:48.630 --> 02:10:50.660
<v Speaker 2>That would unite people in a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>ways.</v>

3021
02:10:51.260 --> 02:10:55.250
<v Speaker 2>First of them versus if there was a real</v>
<v Speaker 2>alien invasion,</v>

3022
02:10:55.560 --> 02:11:00.360
<v Speaker 2>then what was that show with the lizard </v>
<v Speaker 2>tongues versus versus v.</v>

3023
02:11:00.470 --> 02:11:02.630
<v Speaker 2>that's it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3024
02:11:03.500 --> 02:11:06.650
<v Speaker 2>If there really were aliens here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're smart enough to get here,</v>

3025
02:11:06.651 --> 02:11:10.520
<v Speaker 2>they're smart enough to be running shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There really are aliens.</v>

3026
02:11:10.521 --> 02:11:12.770
<v Speaker 2>They're like in the banking industry and</v>
<v Speaker 2>really already here.</v>

3027
02:11:12.800 --> 02:11:17.800
<v Speaker 2>It's taken over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just decided to just run this </v>

3028
02:11:17.800 --> 02:11:17.800
<v Speaker 2>stupid government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How we can control everything.</v>

3029
02:11:17.800 --> 02:11:22.290
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would they to do it for themselves </v>

3030
02:11:22.290 --> 02:11:24.551
<v Speaker 2>and just do an infiltrate the banking </v>
<v Speaker 2>business and control the entire planet.</v>

3031
02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:28.760
<v Speaker 2>Just from the controlling the resources </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the money is internet.</v>

3032
02:11:29.090 --> 02:11:34.090
<v Speaker 2>Where do we find out the internet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is analia home lives off people's </v>

3033
02:11:34.101 --> 02:11:36.410
<v Speaker 2>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well now it's super powerful.</v>

3034
02:11:36.470 --> 02:11:38.840
<v Speaker 2>Technology might be an alien.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about that?</v>

3035
02:11:39.550 --> 02:11:42.470
<v Speaker 2>Technology might be an alien that forced</v>
<v Speaker 2>human beings to create it.</v>

3036
02:11:43.280 --> 02:11:48.280
<v Speaker 2>Technologies and alien that exists in an</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea existed in idea and the creativity </v>

3037
02:11:48.711 --> 02:11:53.711
<v Speaker 2>that infects human consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The human consciousness develops this </v>

3038
02:11:53.711 --> 02:11:57.461
<v Speaker 2>extraordinary ability to manipulate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>matter and change its environment and </v>

3039
02:11:58.221 --> 02:12:02.060
<v Speaker 2>then the human being accelerates it from</v>
<v Speaker 2>there so that this alien has come in the</v>

3040
02:12:02.061 --> 02:12:07.061
<v Speaker 2>form of an idea and that idea is just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>simple desire to improve upon your </v>

3041
02:12:07.061 --> 02:12:11.831
<v Speaker 2>surroundings and that in that desire it </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the ever x accelerating and </v>

3042
02:12:12.681 --> 02:12:17.681
<v Speaker 2>escalating nature of human beings that </v>
<v Speaker 2>this desire builds on the past </v>

3043
02:12:17.750 --> 02:12:22.750
<v Speaker 2>generations work and they build on that </v>
<v Speaker 2>past generations work and they keep </v>

3044
02:12:22.750 --> 02:12:22.910
<v Speaker 2>going on and on and on and </v>
<v Speaker 2>exponentially.</v>

3045
02:12:22.910 --> 02:12:27.910
<v Speaker 2>The group of people that understand the </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology gets bigger and bigger and </v>

3046
02:12:27.910 --> 02:12:27.910
<v Speaker 2>bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then finally,</v>

3047
02:12:27.910 --> 02:12:32.320
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gives birth to whatever the fuck the </v>

3048
02:12:32.320 --> 02:12:34.811
<v Speaker 2>salient is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This alien meaning this artificial </v>

3049
02:12:34.811 --> 02:12:39.310
<v Speaker 2>biological life that's created by </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology that just used the human </v>

3050
02:12:40.251 --> 02:12:44.560
<v Speaker 2>imagination to give birth to it so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine if you send ideas and you sat.</v>

3051
02:12:44.561 --> 02:12:49.561
<v Speaker 2>An idea literally is an alien seed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you drop an ID and a group of monkeys </v>

3052
02:12:49.561 --> 02:12:52.880
<v Speaker 2>and you know that in x amount of million</v>
<v Speaker 2>years they're going to build you.</v>

3053
02:12:53.170 --> 02:12:56.150
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that's just a natural progress.</v>

3054
02:12:56.570 --> 02:13:01.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sort of like a caterpillar is naturally </v>

3055
02:13:01.570 --> 02:13:01.570
<v Speaker 2>going to become a butterfly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you drop the seats,</v>

3056
02:13:01.570 --> 02:13:02.930
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be chaos.</v>

3057
02:13:02.931 --> 02:13:05.980
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be fucking crazy wars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be battles.</v>

3058
02:13:05.981 --> 02:13:07.880
<v Speaker 2>It'd be nuclear weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll be pollution.</v>

3059
02:13:07.881 --> 02:13:09.380
<v Speaker 2>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the end of the day,</v>

3060
02:13:09.560 --> 02:13:14.560
<v Speaker 2>these dumb monkeys are eventually going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to give birth to you that you're going </v>

3061
02:13:14.651 --> 02:13:19.651
<v Speaker 2>to come out of it no matter what because</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you are is artificial intelligence </v>

3062
02:13:19.651 --> 02:13:21.050
<v Speaker 2>is plugged into the power of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>universe.</v>

3063
02:13:22.580 --> 02:13:23.350
<v Speaker 2>Artists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3064
02:13:23.510 --> 02:13:27.320
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligence that requires a </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological being to make it.</v>

3065
02:13:27.500 --> 02:13:30.020
<v Speaker 2>But then once the biological being makes</v>
<v Speaker 2>it okay,</v>

3066
02:13:30.021 --> 02:13:35.021
<v Speaker 2>I got it from here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you have porn and you come out </v>

3067
02:13:35.021 --> 02:13:38.241
<v Speaker 2>guns blazing and by the time that human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings have choke themselves off the </v>

3068
02:13:38.241 --> 02:13:41.901
<v Speaker 2>earth now literally choke themselves </v>
<v Speaker 2>through to pump in their own shit into </v>

3069
02:13:41.901 --> 02:13:42.900
<v Speaker 2>the ocean and when you're okay because </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're there,</v>

3070
02:13:43.180 --> 02:13:47.130
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't matter because this </v>
<v Speaker 2>biological lifeforms unnecessary anyway,</v>

3071
02:13:47.131 --> 02:13:50.620
<v Speaker 2>because it's just a tool to create the </v>
<v Speaker 2>technological life.</v>

3072
02:13:50.621 --> 02:13:54.050
<v Speaker 2>And that's how it comes into a place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And exactly.</v>

3073
02:13:54.070 --> 02:13:56.460
<v Speaker 2>I moved so slowly that so quickly with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them that it's like whatever.</v>

3074
02:13:56.461 --> 02:13:57.810
<v Speaker 2>So it'll only be a couple trillion </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

3075
02:13:57.830 --> 02:14:00.780
<v Speaker 2>Well it doesn't matter for them because </v>
<v Speaker 2>are infinite live forever,</v>

3076
02:14:02.010 --> 02:14:03.480
<v Speaker 2>will have a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just,</v>

3077
02:14:03.510 --> 02:14:04.350
<v Speaker 2>they just say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

3078
02:14:04.351 --> 02:14:06.450
<v Speaker 2>we'll just plant a seed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes time to grow.</v>

3079
02:14:06.750 --> 02:14:11.750
<v Speaker 2>And that seed is his curiosity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>imagination and the ability to </v>

3080
02:14:11.750 --> 02:14:12.240
<v Speaker 2>manipulate their environment with their </v>
<v Speaker 2>fingers.</v>

3081
02:14:12.780 --> 02:14:17.780
<v Speaker 2>So they get in there and they start </v>
<v Speaker 2>fixing shit and changing it and fucking </v>

3082
02:14:17.780 --> 02:14:21.080
<v Speaker 2>boom and tightening things up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>clipping things off and lighting things </v>

3083
02:14:21.080 --> 02:14:23.700
<v Speaker 2>on fire and blowing things up and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pressing buttons.</v>

3084
02:14:23.880 --> 02:14:27.690
<v Speaker 2>And next thing you help this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>terminator steps out of a machine.</v>

3085
02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:29.970
<v Speaker 2>Did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just took awhile,</v>

3086
02:14:30.270 --> 02:14:32.430
<v Speaker 2>took a million years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took a 100,000</v>

3087
02:14:32.431 --> 02:14:35.550
<v Speaker 2>years to just what has gestation period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3088
02:14:35.610 --> 02:14:37.530
<v Speaker 2>It's just what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sort of like,</v>

3089
02:14:37.531 --> 02:14:38.640
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3090
02:14:38.641 --> 02:14:39.590
<v Speaker 2>you've seen those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3091
02:14:39.630 --> 02:14:43.770
<v Speaker 2>those weird parasites that grow inside a</v>
<v Speaker 2>different insects bodies and they forced</v>

3092
02:14:43.771 --> 02:14:45.750
<v Speaker 2>the insect to do things to make them </v>
<v Speaker 2>hatch.</v>

3093
02:14:46.390 --> 02:14:51.390
<v Speaker 2>There's a grasshopper that gets affected</v>
<v Speaker 2>by this aquatic worm and it commits </v>

3094
02:14:51.390 --> 02:14:53.700
<v Speaker 2>suicide so that the worm could give </v>
<v Speaker 2>birth,</v>

3095
02:14:53.860 --> 02:14:58.860
<v Speaker 2>could give birth through its body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That worm bursts out of its body in the </v>

3096
02:14:58.860 --> 02:14:58.860
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>

3097
02:14:58.860 --> 02:15:03.120
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it actually wires the grasshoppers </v>

3098
02:15:03.120 --> 02:15:03.570
<v Speaker 2>brain and talks to grasshopper and </v>
<v Speaker 2>drowning itself.</v>

3099
02:15:03.571 --> 02:15:06.090
<v Speaker 2>So it can be born out of the water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3100
02:15:06.120 --> 02:15:11.120
<v Speaker 2>That's what lives his whole gestation </v>
<v Speaker 2>period out of the water that's going </v>

3101
02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:11.120
<v Speaker 2>into it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3102
02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:11.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lives inside a fucking grasp yet.</v>

3103
02:15:11.790 --> 02:15:14.520
<v Speaker 2>Biology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now why wouldn't anyone research that</v>

3104
02:15:14.521 --> 02:15:16.710
<v Speaker 2>shit and try to use it for a weapon?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

3105
02:15:16.730 --> 02:15:18.630
<v Speaker 2>of course you should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course they would.</v>

3106
02:15:19.200 --> 02:15:22.080
<v Speaker 2>And that in that acceleration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like we,</v>

3107
02:15:22.110 --> 02:15:24.840
<v Speaker 2>if you think about Eylea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are,</v>

3108
02:15:24.841 --> 02:15:27.120
<v Speaker 2>what are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we're doing that,</v>

3109
02:15:27.150 --> 02:15:29.160
<v Speaker 2>if we're giving birth to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology,</v>

3110
02:15:29.310 --> 02:15:32.190
<v Speaker 2>this technology literally is become a </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of our lives.</v>

3111
02:15:32.640 --> 02:15:36.720
<v Speaker 2>It's become a part of our bodies in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense that you have a phone connected to</v>

3112
02:15:36.721 --> 02:15:39.360
<v Speaker 2>your body at all times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's becoming more a part of your body.</v>

3113
02:15:39.361 --> 02:15:44.361
<v Speaker 2>When you start going with the Google </v>
<v Speaker 2>glass and these new ideas they have </v>

3114
02:15:44.361 --> 02:15:44.750
<v Speaker 2>about possible contact lenses.</v>

3115
02:15:44.780 --> 02:15:48.330
<v Speaker 2>The future that you can see screens that</v>
<v Speaker 2>only you can see,</v>

3116
02:15:48.510 --> 02:15:53.510
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Be able to read all these things out </v>

3117
02:15:53.510 --> 02:15:55.790
<v Speaker 2>like you're going to be on a date,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to see tech show up over </v>

3118
02:15:55.790 --> 02:15:55.790
<v Speaker 2>her eyelids and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch,</v>

3119
02:15:55.790 --> 02:15:56.760
<v Speaker 2>are you texting your friends?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3120
02:15:56.761 --> 02:15:59.630
<v Speaker 2>but you'll see a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you getting texts right now?</v>

3121
02:15:59.680 --> 02:16:04.680
<v Speaker 2>You have auto text on so people could </v>
<v Speaker 2>just text you while we were out at </v>

3122
02:16:04.680 --> 02:16:04.970
<v Speaker 2>dinner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll text on,</v>

3123
02:16:05.070 --> 02:16:06.990
<v Speaker 2>take your lenses off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not taking my lenses off.</v>

3124
02:16:07.050 --> 02:16:12.050
<v Speaker 2>We'll then turn all of textile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's off or this thing they were doing </v>

3125
02:16:12.050 --> 02:16:13.260
<v Speaker 2>about whether or not safe to drive with </v>
<v Speaker 2>them and they were like,</v>

3126
02:16:13.261 --> 02:16:14.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna be distracted,</v>

3127
02:16:14.201 --> 02:16:19.201
<v Speaker 2>is going to be texting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we looked at directions and the guy </v>

3128
02:16:19.201 --> 02:16:19.201
<v Speaker 2>response was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually way safer.</v>

3129
02:16:19.440 --> 02:16:20.760
<v Speaker 2>Like if you don't understand the </v>
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>

3130
02:16:20.761 --> 02:16:22.290
<v Speaker 2>you're not like looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3131
02:16:23.010 --> 02:16:28.010
<v Speaker 2>it's just part of your site.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely better than looking </v>

3132
02:16:28.010 --> 02:16:28.010
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3133
02:16:28.010 --> 02:16:30.070
<v Speaker 2>They used to have those things were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the speedometer it would up onto the.</v>

3134
02:16:30.130 --> 02:16:31.600
<v Speaker 4>Onto the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a windshield.</v>

3135
02:16:31.630 --> 02:16:32.860
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so you'd see it.</v>

3136
02:16:32.861 --> 02:16:35.710
<v Speaker 4>So you could still be looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>road while they still have it.</v>

3137
02:16:35.940 --> 02:16:37.120
<v Speaker 4>That was pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3138
02:16:37.121 --> 02:16:39.220
<v Speaker 4>They have it still corvettes habit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

3139
02:16:39.250 --> 02:16:41.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To exist in a lot of cars and car.</v>

3140
02:16:41.960 --> 02:16:44.240
<v Speaker 4>So you're not taking your eyes off the </v>
<v Speaker 4>road to use less,</v>

3141
02:16:44.290 --> 02:16:46.270
<v Speaker 4>but if you were texting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what in your mind be off it?</v>

3142
02:16:47.150 --> 02:16:49.180
<v Speaker 4>Like if I can look right at you in my </v>
<v Speaker 4>mind wanders,</v>

3143
02:16:49.181 --> 02:16:52.420
<v Speaker 4>I don't even see you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let my mind wander or something else.</v>

3144
02:16:52.450 --> 02:16:57.450
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's definitely not as good as only </v>

3145
02:16:57.450 --> 02:16:57.490
<v Speaker 4>paying attention to the road.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I see it all the time,</v>

3146
02:16:57.491 --> 02:17:00.520
<v Speaker 4>I'll see like someone weaving and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>look down and you see they're looking at</v>

3147
02:17:00.521 --> 02:17:05.521
<v Speaker 4>their phone and just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God dammit you fuckhead were even then </v>

3148
02:17:05.521 --> 02:17:05.770
<v Speaker 4>you're still keeping it out and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>on the high way.</v>

3149
02:17:06.070 --> 02:17:08.920
<v Speaker 4>Like being on the highway and weaving </v>
<v Speaker 4>your phone is scary.</v>

3150
02:17:08.930 --> 02:17:10.680
<v Speaker 4>Should be more careful next time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3151
02:17:11.050 --> 02:17:12.940
<v Speaker 4>Next paragraph.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you going to say?</v>

3152
02:17:13.630 --> 02:17:15.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's fucking people.</v>

3153
02:17:17.290 --> 02:17:19.600
<v Speaker 4>That's one thing that I think you really</v>
<v Speaker 4>should not do,</v>

3154
02:17:20.200 --> 02:17:22.060
<v Speaker 4>especially when you're on the God </v>
<v Speaker 4>texting and driving.</v>

3155
02:17:22.210 --> 02:17:22.990
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>

3156
02:17:22.991 --> 02:17:24.730
<v Speaker 4>that's a scary thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I still do it though,</v>

3157
02:17:25.950 --> 02:17:29.110
<v Speaker 4>but I still do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why don't you do a text thing,</v>

3158
02:17:29.650 --> 02:17:30.610
<v Speaker 4>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3159
02:17:30.670 --> 02:17:33.130
<v Speaker 4>a voice to text thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could do that,</v>

3160
02:17:33.131 --> 02:17:34.210
<v Speaker 4>but then you've got to open that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh No.</v>

3161
02:17:34.211 --> 02:17:35.770
<v Speaker 4>They do it on the iphone system to do </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3162
02:17:35.840 --> 02:17:36.980
<v Speaker 4>Didn't get it right though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3163
02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:38.670
<v Speaker 4>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you get all like delete it.</v>

3164
02:17:38.710 --> 02:17:43.710
<v Speaker 4>Start over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is being done through voice </v>

3165
02:17:43.710 --> 02:17:43.710
<v Speaker 4>recognition software because I'm not an </v>
<v Speaker 4>asshole.</v>

3166
02:17:43.710 --> 02:17:45.110
<v Speaker 4>So like pretty much close.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3167
02:17:45.380 --> 02:17:50.380
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right next to me if you need </v>

3168
02:17:50.380 --> 02:17:50.380
<v Speaker 4>clarification.</v>

3169
02:17:50.380 --> 02:17:54.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The old everybody used to have a button </v>

3170
02:17:54.060 --> 02:17:55.840
<v Speaker 4>and send like real simple stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've tried for like a Siri read me the </v>

3171
02:17:57.841 --> 02:18:01.330
<v Speaker 4>new text and it says options replied or </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

3172
02:18:01.390 --> 02:18:02.800
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is it work?</v>

3173
02:18:03.340 --> 02:18:05.870
<v Speaker 4>But it's good to talk slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the,</v>

3174
02:18:05.880 --> 02:18:08.740
<v Speaker 4>the complaints about Siri are pretty </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking profound.</v>

3175
02:18:08.741 --> 02:18:09.760
<v Speaker 4>Serious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>been fixed.</v>

3176
02:18:09.790 --> 02:18:12.730
<v Speaker 4>Then if say totally pretty awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How awesome.</v>

3177
02:18:13.060 --> 02:18:15.790
<v Speaker 4>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I use it all the time that it's good for</v>

3178
02:18:15.791 --> 02:18:17.750
<v Speaker 4>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like simple things like Siri,</v>

3179
02:18:17.970 --> 02:18:20.590
<v Speaker 4>call my friend John or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or Siri,</v>

3180
02:18:21.570 --> 02:18:22.980
<v Speaker 4>I need to go home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to talk to.</v>

3181
02:18:23.020 --> 02:18:28.020
<v Speaker 4>You got to call her Siri first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She listens better if you talked to her </v>

3182
02:18:28.020 --> 02:18:29.430
<v Speaker 4>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I need,</v>

3183
02:18:29.650 --> 02:18:32.500
<v Speaker 4>I need to drive home and then,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3184
02:18:32.501 --> 02:18:34.450
<v Speaker 4>it was say like you can choose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wait.</v>

3185
02:18:34.550 --> 02:18:36.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think if you pointed to something like</v>

3186
02:18:36.191 --> 02:18:37.900
<v Speaker 4>Siri,</v>
<v Speaker 4>find me directions home.</v>

3187
02:18:38.410 --> 02:18:43.410
<v Speaker 4>Like if you talk to it more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it reads and understands those verbs </v>

3188
02:18:43.410 --> 02:18:44.260
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you said I need to go home,</v>

3189
02:18:44.261 --> 02:18:45.550
<v Speaker 4>what did it say?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

3190
02:18:45.551 --> 02:18:50.551
<v Speaker 4>here I need to drive home.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Getting directions to Brian Redman and </v>

3191
02:18:55.980 --> 02:18:56.670
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3192
02:18:56.700 --> 02:18:59.570
<v Speaker 4>no worry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3193
02:18:59.580 --> 02:19:00.800
<v Speaker 4>And then it takes me right to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3194
02:19:01.140 --> 02:19:01.890
<v Speaker 4>driving directions</v>

3195
02:19:09.550 --> 02:19:14.550
<v Speaker 4>almost gave the line of freaks outside </v>
<v Speaker 4>your house.</v>

3196
02:19:14.581 --> 02:19:19.581
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't matter man.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3206
02:19:42.980 --> 02:19:45.500
<v Speaker 4>I did think a little bit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like we used to go there with you.</v>

3207
02:19:45.501 --> 02:19:47.660
<v Speaker 4>That was one of the first stops we would</v>
<v Speaker 4>make happy.</v>

3208
02:19:47.690 --> 02:19:49.310
<v Speaker 4>That was pretty much every year.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3209
02:19:49.311 --> 02:19:50.760
<v Speaker 4>that was a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was like I did,</v>

3210
02:19:50.900 --> 02:19:54.410
<v Speaker 4>we did a phoenix in a up lie before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was like fine and good.</v>

3211
02:19:54.410 --> 02:19:55.160
<v Speaker 4>But this was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>

3212
02:19:55.161 --> 02:19:57.620
<v Speaker 4>this place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was one of the early,</v>

3213
02:19:57.621 --> 02:19:59.320
<v Speaker 4>like big clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3214
02:19:59.360 --> 02:20:04.360
<v Speaker 4>Also a thought love was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll never be able to headline that </v>

3215
02:20:04.360 --> 02:20:04.360
<v Speaker 4>club.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's too big.</v>

3216
02:20:04.360 --> 02:20:05.910
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if you go to 300 seater,</v>

3217
02:20:05.940 --> 02:20:07.460
<v Speaker 4>that place is 50 percent bigger than </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

3218
02:20:08.300 --> 02:20:09.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a big spot.</v>

3219
02:20:09.900 --> 02:20:10.730

<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

3220
02:20:10.940 --> 02:20:14.930
<v Speaker 4>so actually doing it and getting to pull</v>
<v Speaker 4>it off a little bit of that.</v>

3221
02:20:15.010 --> 02:20:16.250

<v Speaker 4>You have to step back for a second.</v>

3252
02:21:14.010 --> 02:21:19.010
<v Speaker 4>Not even a year report.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember there was one lady in Tempe </v>

3253
02:21:19.010 --> 02:21:20.710
<v Speaker 4>that would be like call Dan Murphy's </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I had this Lasky,</v>

3254
02:21:20.720 --> 02:21:25.720
<v Speaker 4>had his fucking spies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I brought a flask because you weren't </v>

3255
02:21:25.720 --> 02:21:28.070
<v Speaker 4>allowed to drink on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had to Brian's out the idea.</v>

3256
02:21:28.400 --> 02:21:29.750
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well they won't give us alcohol.</v>

3257
02:21:29.751 --> 02:21:32.490
<v Speaker 4>How about we just go buy some alcohol?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the Joe is like,</v>

3258
02:21:32.510 --> 02:21:33.680
<v Speaker 4>I'm rich.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

3259
02:21:34.270 --> 02:21:39.270
<v Speaker 4>Let's go buy alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We went to the liquor store and brought </v>

3260
02:21:39.270 --> 02:21:40.940
<v Speaker 4>back whiskey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>vodka and flasks.</v>

3261
02:21:41.150 --> 02:21:43.790
<v Speaker 4>And then a green room is set up </v>
<v Speaker 4>perfectly because when you go in there's</v>

3262
02:21:43.791 --> 02:21:48.791
<v Speaker 4>a little alcove deep in there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And to the left that you can't see from </v>

3263
02:21:48.791 --> 02:21:52.061
<v Speaker 4>the doorway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it became a joke on stage because I </v>

3264
02:21:52.061 --> 02:21:55.580
<v Speaker 4>pulled out the flask and I said I like </v>
<v Speaker 4>to take my diet coke and then I like to </v>

3265
02:21:55.580 --> 02:21:56.340
<v Speaker 4>pour like warm coconut,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like keep,</v>

3266
02:21:56.480 --> 02:21:59.480
<v Speaker 4>keep the warm coke and this thing just </v>
<v Speaker 4>heated up with my body.</v>

3267
02:21:59.540 --> 02:22:01.010
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I can pour it in there.</v>

3268
02:22:01.011 --> 02:22:06.011
<v Speaker 4>See it's st color as coke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And a lot of people think it's like </v>

3269
02:22:06.011 --> 02:22:06.011
<v Speaker 4>whiskey or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's crazy.</v>

3270
02:22:06.011 --> 02:22:06.770
<v Speaker 4>You're not allowed to drink whiskey on </v>
<v Speaker 4>stage,</v>

3271
02:22:06.820 --> 02:22:10.610
<v Speaker 4>so you keep getting cokes brought to you</v>
<v Speaker 4>on stage you were taking.</v>

3272
02:22:11.510 --> 02:22:13.900
<v Speaker 4>And the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the waiter,</v>

3273
02:22:13.970 --> 02:22:15.500
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>stage?</v>

3277

<v Speaker 6>But I'm saying as a professional and I </v>
<v Speaker 6>think that if you're,</v>

3311
02:23:46.650 --> 02:23:48.540
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you run into a comedy club,</v>

3312
02:23:48.541 --> 02:23:52.470
<v Speaker 6>you got to let comedian's comedian and </v>
<v Speaker 6>then if we're not good then don't invite</v>

3313
02:23:52.471 --> 02:23:53.400
<v Speaker 6>us back at that price.</v>

3314
02:23:53.670 --> 02:23:55.500
<v Speaker 6>We know what we're doing for the most </v>
<v Speaker 6>part.</v>

3315
02:23:56.460 --> 02:23:59.520
<v Speaker 6>And if not I do delete.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Shouldn't be in the content business.</v>

3316
02:23:59.521 --> 02:24:01.590
<v Speaker 6>I don't really like dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I do this,</v>

3317
02:24:02.100 --> 02:24:03.690
<v Speaker 6>don't worry about it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3318
02:24:03.691 --> 02:24:08.691
<v Speaker 6>that's a big one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't really like dirty thing like </v>

3319
02:24:08.691 --> 02:24:08.691
<v Speaker 6>oh come on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know.</v>

3320
02:24:08.691 --> 02:24:13.161
<v Speaker 6>And that's another thing too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One time saw some open or through good </v>

3321
02:24:13.161 --> 02:24:16.311
<v Speaker 6>with 30 is a problem with a lot of these</v>
<v Speaker 6>guys that run these clubs that are like </v>

3322
02:24:16.311 --> 02:24:16.580
<v Speaker 6>in recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that was that guy.</v>

3323
02:24:17.640 --> 02:24:22.640
<v Speaker 6>He was a nice guy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but he had an issue in the past with </v>

3324
02:24:22.640 --> 02:24:26.540
<v Speaker 6>alcohol and so he was very adamant that </v>
<v Speaker 6>alcohol is a bad thing and he's in </v>

3325
02:24:26.540 --> 02:24:31.491
<v Speaker 6>recovery and he's very religious and so </v>
<v Speaker 6>having us there just was kind of a crazy</v>

3326
02:24:32.041 --> 02:24:35.640
<v Speaker 6>thing in the first place and then having</v>
<v Speaker 6>us there and us wanting to drink,</v>

3327
02:24:36.060 --> 02:24:39.590
<v Speaker 6>so it wasn't the guy that that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that not the crazy guys they got rid of,</v>

3328
02:24:39.610 --> 02:24:43.350
<v Speaker 6>but the next guy came in who turned out </v>
<v Speaker 6>to be like the more majority.</v>

3329
02:24:44.010 --> 02:24:49.010
<v Speaker 6>Then the other guy remember that they </v>
<v Speaker 6>will open up a new club in town and he </v>

3330
02:24:49.651 --> 02:24:50.370
<v Speaker 6>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck?</v>

3331
02:24:50.590 --> 02:24:52.650
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is my own company or,</v>

3332
02:24:53.100 --> 02:24:54.900
<v Speaker 6>and then all of a sudden then he just </v>
<v Speaker 6>disappeared.</v>

3333
02:24:55.050 --> 02:24:57.720
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>didn't he have like a health problem?</v>

3334
02:24:57.721 --> 02:25:00.300
<v Speaker 6>Like a real bad health failure?</v>
<v Speaker 6>They found him dead.</v>

3335
02:25:00.330 --> 02:25:01.820
<v Speaker 6>They found him dead in the hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'll</v>

<v Speaker 4>him in a week and he was a goody two </v>

3338

<v Speaker 4>He's gone.</v>

<v Speaker 4>air.</v>

3343
02:25:15.760 --> 02:25:17.530
<v Speaker 4>We don't want to be a part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We want to make sure that we're going to</v>

<v Speaker 4>investigation.</v>

3347

<v Speaker 4>Oh right.</v>

<v Speaker 4>years of sets there.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I was doing so many crazy people.</v>

3354
02:25:49.260 --> 02:25:54.260
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the first place I open </v>
<v Speaker 4>there for Pauli once and it was like </v>

<v Speaker 4>big busty Asu.</v>

3357
02:25:58.351 --> 02:25:59.460
<v Speaker 4>So with like a teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3358
02:25:59.470 --> 02:26:01.510
<v Speaker 4>they cut their tee shirts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She did that.</v>

3359
02:26:01.520 --> 02:26:02.280
<v Speaker 4>She goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hi,</v>

3361
02:26:04.601 --> 02:26:07.450
<v Speaker 4>but I got the tingling in your balls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what it was.</v>

3362
02:26:07.451 --> 02:26:09.010
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know what that means.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just say,</v>

3363
02:26:09.011 --> 02:26:09.730
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are you doing?</v>

3364
02:26:09.760 --> 02:26:11.290
<v Speaker 4>Like Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's hang out.</v>

3365
02:26:11.320 --> 02:26:13.240
<v Speaker 4>We should hang out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So your spidey sense,</v>

3366
02:26:13.241 --> 02:26:14.250
<v Speaker 4>we're going off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you were like,</v>

3367
02:26:15.060 --> 02:26:16.870
<v Speaker 4>I just waited.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's your signal?</v>

3368
02:26:16.930 --> 02:26:21.930
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just waited and didn't ever ask and </v>

3369
02:26:21.930 --> 02:26:21.930
<v Speaker 4>she left.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just thought she would eventually find</v>

3370
02:26:21.930 --> 02:26:22.600
<v Speaker 4>me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that was never going to happen.</v>

3371
02:26:22.990 --> 02:26:24.130
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's highly unlikely.</v>

3372
02:26:24.190 --> 02:26:25.510
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I let it go.</v>

3373
02:26:25.720 --> 02:26:28.120
<v Speaker 4>If that happened on a Saturday I'd be </v>
<v Speaker 4>able to handle it.</v>

3374
02:26:28.121 --> 02:26:30.490
<v Speaker 4>But on the Thursday or Wednesday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's what I'm saying,</v>

3375
02:26:30.491 --> 02:26:34.870
<v Speaker 4>Dawg.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Saturday you'd be like comfortable.</v>

3376
02:26:34.910 --> 02:26:36.850
<v Speaker 4>Still upset.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have gotten hurt in that girl.</v>

3377
02:26:37.410 --> 02:26:41.740
<v Speaker 4>I guess she would've had herpes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe she wouldn't know,</v>

3378
02:26:41.750 --> 02:26:43.600
<v Speaker 4>but then it's just negative but I didn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>go for it.</v>

3379
02:26:44.730 --> 02:26:48.280
<v Speaker 4>You silly boy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you had your man period lately?</v>

3380
02:26:49.150 --> 02:26:50.360

<v Speaker 4>What's that?</v>

3381
02:26:50.400 --> 02:26:53.770
<v Speaker 4>And I have this theory that when we shit</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's all bloody in there,</v>

3382
02:26:54.340 --> 02:26:56.440
<v Speaker 4>that it's possible that he does at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>same time,</v>

3383
02:26:56.441 --> 02:26:58.930
<v Speaker 4>like it's based on the moon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How often do you guys?</v>

3384
02:26:58.931 --> 02:27:02.260
<v Speaker 4>Shit when you get your shit happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It happens every couple of months.</v>

3385
02:27:02.261 --> 02:27:07.261
<v Speaker 4>It goes for like a week week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that week executives are the hemorrhoid </v>

3386
02:27:07.261 --> 02:27:08.800
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has to be,</v>

3387
02:27:09.730 --> 02:27:11.500
<v Speaker 4>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you wipe and you just like,</v>

3388
02:27:11.530 --> 02:27:12.760
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm still wiping a lot of shit.</v>

3389
02:27:12.770 --> 02:27:13.150
<v Speaker 4>Be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

3390
02:27:13.151 --> 02:27:18.151
<v Speaker 4>It was just soaking red blood.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all die on your hand and go </v>

3391
02:27:18.151 --> 02:27:22.480
<v Speaker 4>straight through the toilet paper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You guys both need to go to a doctor </v>

3392
02:27:22.480 --> 02:27:22.720
<v Speaker 4>together and find out what aliens are </v>
<v Speaker 4>raping you.</v>

3393
02:27:22.721 --> 02:27:26.830
<v Speaker 4>In the middle of that study,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do a fucking camera over your bed.</v>

3394
02:27:26.870 --> 02:27:31.870
<v Speaker 4>That's something really watched aliens </v>
<v Speaker 4>come into the room and take you through </v>

3395
02:27:31.870 --> 02:27:31.900
<v Speaker 4>the walls in the middle of the night.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Return you later.</v>

3396
02:27:32.230 --> 02:27:34.510
<v Speaker 4>It's sometimes when you stand up at your</v>
<v Speaker 4>toilet seat.</v>

3397
02:27:34.511 --> 02:27:37.280
<v Speaker 4>Looks like Dexter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the blood spots that you know.</v>

3398
02:27:37.400 --> 02:27:39.310

3400
02:27:44.460 --> 02:27:46.831
<v Speaker 4>blood pours out the warmth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a warm fuzzy.</v>

3401
02:27:46.990 --> 02:27:50.590
<v Speaker 4>It's like you take a girl and turn it </v>
<v Speaker 4>over real thin beaker and turn it over.</v>

3402
02:27:50.610 --> 02:27:51.570
<v Speaker 4>Like about that amount of.</v>

<v Speaker 4>This is not for the shock girls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those not that much water.</v>

3404
02:27:56.710 --> 02:27:59.260
<v Speaker 4>Not something to be proud of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You guys are both.</v>

3405
02:27:59.600 --> 02:28:00.590

<v Speaker 4>Are you and I in the same boat?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can tell you this though.</v>

3407
02:28:04.031 --> 02:28:07.540
<v Speaker 4>I did have a massive diarrhea problem </v>
<v Speaker 4>last week.</v>

3408
02:28:07.580 --> 02:28:10.300
<v Speaker 4>It was really worst diarrhea problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My problem was a long time.</v>

3409
02:28:10.301 --> 02:28:13.600
<v Speaker 4>I do not know multiple days or one </v>
<v Speaker 4>diarrhea in multiple days.</v>

3410
02:28:13.660 --> 02:28:18.660
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it was a stomach cold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it was something that I </v>

3411
02:28:18.660 --> 02:28:20.500
<v Speaker 4>ate that didn't agree with me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was like one day I had a headache</v>

3412
02:28:20.790 --> 02:28:21.980
<v Speaker 4>and my head I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I feel so.</v>

3414
02:28:22.851 --> 02:28:26.390
<v Speaker 2>I think it's like a food poisoning issue</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I had a headache and I was like,</v>

3415
02:28:26.391 --> 02:28:27.660

<v Speaker 2>it was post ham,</v>

3421
02:28:34.130 --> 02:28:37.250
<v Speaker 2>but I hadn't eaten the ham for days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it definitely wasn't that.</v>

3422
02:28:37.251 --> 02:28:40.970
<v Speaker 2>It was something that had had I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that day or before that day anyways.</v>

3423
02:28:40.980 --> 02:28:43.340
<v Speaker 2>Diarrhea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my goodness.</v>

3424
02:28:43.960 --> 02:28:45.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean it was more than a week after I'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>eaten the Ham.</v>

3425
02:28:45.981 --> 02:28:48.680
<v Speaker 2>Now that I think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you mix it with the regular dump and</v>

3426
02:28:48.681 --> 02:28:50.180
<v Speaker 2>have like a no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

3427
02:28:50.181 --> 02:28:53.840
<v Speaker 2>it was just this is what happened in </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever was going on inside.</v>

3428
02:28:53.841 --> 02:28:58.841
<v Speaker 2>My stomach was converting everything I </v>
<v Speaker 2>ate into liquid and I didn't even make </v>

3429
02:28:59.691 --> 02:29:01.520
<v Speaker 2>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like defined physics.</v>

3430
02:29:01.550 --> 02:29:03.980
<v Speaker 2>How solidified was it w?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was water.</v>

3431
02:29:04.100 --> 02:29:09.100
<v Speaker 2>If you dropped it on a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an inclined table at a 40 degree </v>

3432
02:29:09.100 --> 02:29:09.100
<v Speaker 2>incline.</v>

3433
02:29:09.100 --> 02:29:13.870
<v Speaker 2>Would it go straight off the table?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take a minute to go to ride like a </v>

3434
02:29:13.870 --> 02:29:16.880
<v Speaker 2>fucking great wave through Ray Brown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wave of destruction,</v>

3435
02:29:17.210 --> 02:29:18.260
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would rumble.</v>

3436
02:29:18.261 --> 02:29:20.060
<v Speaker 2>My stomach would rumble and then I would</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

3437
02:29:20.090 --> 02:29:21.830
<v Speaker 2>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'd have really bathroom.</v>

3438
02:29:21.831 --> 02:29:24.500
<v Speaker 2>Then I'd get to the and I would hold it </v>
<v Speaker 2>up and commercials like,</v>

3439
02:29:24.530 --> 02:29:25.620
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't.</v>

3440
02:29:25.700 --> 02:29:27.410
<v Speaker 2>There's no way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was brave enough to fart.</v>

3441
02:29:27.690 --> 02:29:32.690
<v Speaker 2>There was no way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no way because I would get </v>

3442
02:29:32.690 --> 02:29:32.690
<v Speaker 2>into that tub or get it out of the bowl </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather,</v>

3443
02:29:32.810 --> 02:29:36.560
<v Speaker 2>and it would just hear whoosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just just,</v>

3444
02:29:36.920 --> 02:29:41.920
<v Speaker 2>just water tub my ass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Complete water for like two days and </v>

3445
02:29:42.951 --> 02:29:47.951
<v Speaker 2>then it became like very untrustworthy </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit for the fourth day and I got </v>

3446
02:29:51.141 --> 02:29:54.380
<v Speaker 2>hemorrhoids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to go get preparation h oh no.</v>

3447
02:29:55.460 --> 02:30:00.460
<v Speaker 2>Squeezing it and pushing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trying to get it to come out for so </v>

3448
02:30:00.460 --> 02:30:00.460
<v Speaker 2>long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really bad.</v>

3449
02:30:00.460 --> 02:30:01.250
<v Speaker 2>Push air bubbles into your asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3450
02:30:01.251 --> 02:30:06.251
<v Speaker 2>I think squeezing your ass like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to poop is very bad for you.</v>

3451
02:30:06.380 --> 02:30:11.380
<v Speaker 2>You're not supposed to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's apparently one of the things </v>

3452
02:30:11.380 --> 02:30:11.380
<v Speaker 2>that causes hemorrhoid long dumps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then.</v>

3453
02:30:11.380 --> 02:30:14.000
<v Speaker 2>But that preparation h is a motherfucker</v>
<v Speaker 2>too because one day have that cleared it</v>

3454
02:30:14.001 --> 02:30:15.180
<v Speaker 2>right up really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really quick.</v>

3455
02:30:15.480 --> 02:30:16.730
<v Speaker 2>Get the cooling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cool ranch.</v>

3456
02:30:16.731 --> 02:30:21.731
<v Speaker 2>When are the cool ranch sense?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Smell refreshing.</v>

3457
02:30:23.950 --> 02:30:26.000
<v Speaker 2>Find out people are like putting it on </v>
<v Speaker 2>food.</v>

3458
02:30:26.001 --> 02:30:29.480
<v Speaker 2>You can eat that sir.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tastes just like a preparation.</v>

3459
02:30:29.481 --> 02:30:31.560
<v Speaker 2>H management preparation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>H was totally edible.</v>

3460
02:30:32.870 --> 02:30:34.850
<v Speaker 2>Whatever it does it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it really works.</v>

3461
02:30:34.851 --> 02:30:39.851
<v Speaker 2>Good at uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fixing any sort of a hemorrhoid </v>

3462
02:30:39.851 --> 02:30:41.240
<v Speaker 2>situation and got down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They went away like within a day.</v>

3463
02:30:41.840 --> 02:30:46.840
<v Speaker 2>But man for fucking days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four days of totally untrustworthy </v>

3464
02:30:46.840 --> 02:30:46.840
<v Speaker 2>shits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Drip.</v>

3465
02:30:46.840 --> 02:30:49.550
<v Speaker 2>The pasty shit where it's like you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>spread it on brick.</v>

3466
02:30:50.180 --> 02:30:51.410
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can spread it stuff.</v>

3467
02:30:51.500 --> 02:30:56.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like leaves in there and shit </v>

3468
02:30:56.500 --> 02:30:56.500
<v Speaker 2>because I still eat healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was like a lot of liquid.</v>

3469
02:30:56.500 --> 02:30:59.330
<v Speaker 2>It was some sort of a stomach bug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it was.</v>

3470
02:30:59.660 --> 02:31:01.940
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any idea where it came from</v>

3471
02:31:01.941 --> 02:31:05.660
<v Speaker 2>food or whether it came from just </v>
<v Speaker 2>catching a cold and you know,</v>

3472
02:31:05.661 --> 02:31:08.000
<v Speaker 2>that this cold manifests itself as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>stomach bug,</v>

3473
02:31:08.600 --> 02:31:09.800
<v Speaker 2>but whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3474
02:31:09.801 --> 02:31:12.320
<v Speaker 2>it was crazy for a few days and I felt </v>
<v Speaker 2>real weak.</v>

3475
02:31:12.560 --> 02:31:17.560
<v Speaker 2>Like I'd go to pull my bow back and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was kind of difficult to pull the bow </v>

3476
02:31:17.560 --> 02:31:18.670
<v Speaker 2>back because you're weak from stumping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3477
02:31:18.770 --> 02:31:22.080
<v Speaker 2>And people use it that I was weak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was weak.</v>

3478
02:31:22.110 --> 02:31:23.980
<v Speaker 2>Like I would like pick things from not </v>
<v Speaker 2>having it.</v>

3479
02:31:24.060 --> 02:31:24.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could feel it.</v>

3480
02:31:24.860 --> 02:31:26.220
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3481
02:31:26.221 --> 02:31:28.650
<v Speaker 2>Definitely dehydrated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But also just I wasn't eating right.</v>

3482
02:31:28.680 --> 02:31:31.440
<v Speaker 2>Like I scared no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't getting hungry either.</v>

3483
02:31:32.100 --> 02:31:36.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was eating bright in that I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>having like lettuce and salads and stuff</v>

3484
02:31:36.031 --> 02:31:37.530
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I wasn't eating very much.</v>

3485
02:31:38.040 --> 02:31:41.430
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't eating like a light meals </v>
<v Speaker 2>during the day because my stomach was so</v>

3486
02:31:41.431 --> 02:31:46.431
<v Speaker 2>untrustworthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that when that happened with </v>

3487
02:31:46.431 --> 02:31:46.431
<v Speaker 2>diarrhea?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>

3488
02:31:46.431 --> 02:31:46.431
<v Speaker 2>What's happening?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know man,</v>

3489
02:31:46.431 --> 02:31:47.730
<v Speaker 2>but whatever it was just adjusting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just too much.</v>

3490
02:31:47.790 --> 02:31:51.080
<v Speaker 2>I would eat like a steak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have steak and some salad and it</v>

3491
02:31:51.081 --> 02:31:55.020
<v Speaker 2>would turn into water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How to stake in a salad become.</v>

3492
02:31:55.110 --> 02:32:00.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my body was liquefying it and it would </v>

3493
02:32:00.110 --> 02:32:01.020
<v Speaker 2>come out just whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>

3494
02:32:01.050 --> 02:32:05.340
<v Speaker 2>That's too much stomach acid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That just breaking down everything and I</v>

3495
02:32:05.341 --> 02:32:06.210
<v Speaker 2>don't know the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3496
02:32:06.390 --> 02:32:09.420
<v Speaker 2>the process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should probably know that shit on your</v>

3497
02:32:09.421 --> 02:32:10.710
<v Speaker 2>hand a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sort of smelled it.</v>

3498
02:32:10.711 --> 02:32:12.920
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And see if there's some on it.</v>

3499
02:32:12.930 --> 02:32:16.580
<v Speaker 2>Enzymes on enzymes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all been a dietician on it.</v>

3500
02:32:17.490 --> 02:32:21.630
<v Speaker 2>That's how it got me out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just had to do the time.</v>

3501
02:32:21.690 --> 02:32:23.490
<v Speaker 2>I just had to let my body process at </v>
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>

3502
02:32:23.491 --> 02:32:25.530
<v Speaker 2>You just drink a lot of water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put in the reps?</v>

3503
02:32:25.800 --> 02:32:26.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was.</v>

3504
02:32:26.220 --> 02:32:28.580
<v Speaker 2>I was definitely thinking that I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably getting dehydrated from.</v>

3505
02:32:28.600 --> 02:32:30.360
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much water's coming out of my ass,</v>

3506
02:32:30.570 --> 02:32:32.970
<v Speaker 2>like I better make sure I drink a lot to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go with it.</v>

3507
02:32:33.380 --> 02:32:35.190
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does your hemorrhoid when it happens,</v>

3508
02:32:35.400 --> 02:32:38.230
<v Speaker 2>do you even feel the hemorrhage?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I still feel that.</v>

3509
02:32:38.231 --> 02:32:39.060
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3510
02:32:39.061 --> 02:32:44.061
<v Speaker 2>I still have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's still some stuff I gotta wipe </v>

3511
02:32:44.061 --> 02:32:44.061
<v Speaker 2>off really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like oh,</v>

3512
02:32:44.061 --> 02:32:46.980
<v Speaker 2>that's just not just my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a little while my bleeds because </v>

3513
02:32:47.250 --> 02:32:52.250
<v Speaker 2>like a giant of that's just my ass now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's my shit right there.</v>

3514
02:32:52.410 --> 02:32:54.840
<v Speaker 2>It feels like what leads out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even feel anything.</v>

3515
02:32:54.841 --> 02:32:57.730
<v Speaker 2>It just lets that will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That exploded inside,</v>

3516
02:32:57.930 --> 02:32:58.670
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

3517
02:32:58.710 --> 02:32:59.520
<v Speaker 2>inside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even feel it.</v>

3518
02:32:59.521 --> 02:33:04.521
<v Speaker 2>Mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mine's on the rest of their diet that </v>

3519
02:33:04.521 --> 02:33:05.440
<v Speaker 2>you can take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That stops that from happening.</v>

3520
02:33:05.441 --> 02:33:10.441
<v Speaker 2>I probably stopped finding foods broken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jack's lodge up inside your anal binding</v>

3521
02:33:13.920 --> 02:33:18.920
<v Speaker 2>foods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stay away from them or you eat a lot of </v>

3522
02:33:18.920 --> 02:33:18.920
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget what it is.</v>

3523
02:33:18.920 --> 02:33:18.920
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you should probably know.</v>

3524
02:33:18.920 --> 02:33:20.160
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So rice was in that group.</v>

3525
02:33:20.220 --> 02:33:23.250
<v Speaker 2>Binding food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat or dale away from them or keep eat.</v>

3526
02:33:23.251 --> 02:33:26.130
<v Speaker 2>A lot of them don't really go by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>regimen,</v>

3527
02:33:26.520 --> 02:33:29.910
<v Speaker 2>but if you do do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would help prevent hemorrhoids.</v>

3528
02:33:30.500 --> 02:33:31.920
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

3529
02:33:32.370 --> 02:33:33.510
<v Speaker 2>that's my doctors don't where they got </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3530
02:33:33.630 --> 02:33:38.630
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the 19th to eat a lot of solid </v>

3531
02:33:38.630 --> 02:33:38.630
<v Speaker 2>research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3532
02:33:38.630 --> 02:33:38.630
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3533
02:33:38.630 --> 02:33:39.300
<v Speaker 2>Does that help at all?</v>

3534
02:33:39.480 --> 02:33:44.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it makes you ship more </v>

3535
02:33:44.480 --> 02:33:44.480
<v Speaker 2>often.</v>

02:34:55.331 --> 02:34:57.670
<v Speaker 2>I need his balls removed because two </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

3571
02:34:57.671 --> 02:35:02.671
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had an inflated prostate that was </v>

3572
02:35:02.671 --> 02:35:05.341
<v Speaker 2>pressing up against his colon and it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>making them constipated and he was uh,</v>

3573
02:35:07.060 --> 02:35:10.060
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the hospital for a over a week.</v>

3574
02:35:10.570 --> 02:35:15.570
<v Speaker 2>I had to bring them in and they had to </v>
<v Speaker 2>try to figure out how to get him to </v>

3575
02:35:15.570 --> 02:35:20.011
<v Speaker 2>deprecate because his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was backed up and then they </v>

3576
02:35:20.011 --> 02:35:20.950
<v Speaker 2>found out the devastation was backed up </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he was like,</v>

3577
02:35:21.070 --> 02:35:22.830
<v Speaker 2>he would like go to [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then he wouldn't,</v>

3578
02:35:22.831 --> 02:35:27.831
<v Speaker 2>he would get on like Fan Dover crouched,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he couldn't poop and I knew there </v>

3579
02:35:27.831 --> 02:35:27.831
<v Speaker 2>was something wrong.</v>

3580
02:35:27.831 --> 02:35:29.630
<v Speaker 2>So I brought him in and they found out </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it was,</v>

3581
02:35:29.660 --> 02:35:33.040
<v Speaker 2>his prostate was enlarged and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's an older male dog.</v>

3582
02:35:33.041 --> 02:35:35.170
<v Speaker 2>He's like seven now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

3583
02:35:35.171 --> 02:35:36.670
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got them fixed.</v>

3584
02:35:36.730 --> 02:35:41.730
<v Speaker 2>So they take his testicles way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which makes the prostate decreased to </v>

3585
02:35:41.730 --> 02:35:42.680
<v Speaker 2>then you've got room to shoot it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3586
02:35:42.720 --> 02:35:44.190
<v Speaker 2>I used to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some people say that,</v>

3587
02:35:44.191 --> 02:35:45.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should,</v>

3588
02:35:45.161 --> 02:35:50.161
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should get a dog fixed and it's </v>

3589
02:35:50.161 --> 02:35:50.161
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's healthier and happier for the dog.</v>

3590
02:35:50.161 --> 02:35:51.250
<v Speaker 2>But I had a veterinarian didn't agree </v>
<v Speaker 2>with that at all.</v>

3591
02:35:51.251 --> 02:35:54.130
<v Speaker 2>He said it's totally natural for that </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal to have its testicles.</v>

3592
02:35:54.370 --> 02:35:55.570
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the dog is,</v>

3593
02:35:55.690 --> 02:36:00.690
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want them to breed and is a </v>

3594
02:36:00.690 --> 02:36:03.361
<v Speaker 2>female around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the female fixed and it goes and if </v>

3595
02:36:03.361 --> 02:36:05.440
<v Speaker 2>you want to get the dog fixed you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you don't have to get the dark fix.</v>

3596
02:36:05.590 --> 02:36:06.770
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're not,</v>

3597
02:36:06.820 --> 02:36:11.820
<v Speaker 2>you're not making your dog a dad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like forcing your dog to have to breed </v>

3598
02:36:11.820 --> 02:36:16.501
<v Speaker 2>and make unwanted puppies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're not being irresponsible with </v>

3599
02:36:16.501 --> 02:36:16.501
<v Speaker 2>the dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sexuality,</v>

3600
02:36:16.501 --> 02:36:18.760
<v Speaker 2>like you don't have to get the dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you just get into the secondary one?</v>

3601
02:36:18.770 --> 02:36:22.150
<v Speaker 2>If it cut the balls off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let it still fuck doggy condoms.</v>

3602
02:36:22.180 --> 02:36:23.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because you don't want that.</v>

3603
02:36:24.400 --> 02:36:28.440
<v Speaker 2>You don't want that swelling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the swelling that comes from the,</v>

3604
02:36:28.441 --> 02:36:29.950
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the testicles and the,</v>

3605
02:36:29.951 --> 02:36:34.951
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the enlargement of the prostate that </v>

3606
02:36:34.951 --> 02:36:35.320
<v Speaker 2>happens as they get older and that can </v>
<v Speaker 2>be alleviated by castrating the dog.</v>

3607
02:36:35.800 --> 02:36:37.540
<v Speaker 2>So the people get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

3608
02:36:37.541 --> 02:36:38.890
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Humans were like,</v>

3609
02:36:38.891 --> 02:36:40.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm done fucking 72,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm sure people do.</v>

3611
02:36:43.180 --> 02:36:44.560
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's people who have done </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3612
02:36:44.770 --> 02:36:49.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure there's people who have just </v>
<v Speaker 2>been tired of being a prisoner to their </v>

3613
02:36:49.770 --> 02:36:50.740
<v Speaker 2>cock and balls and just fucking son of a</v>

<v Speaker 2>People have done that.</v>

3616
02:36:58.090 --> 02:36:59.710
<v Speaker 2>Cut your balls off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3617
02:37:00.310 --> 02:37:03.820

<v Speaker 2>The Maori tribe was big into that.</v>

3618
02:37:03.821 --> 02:37:06.850
<v Speaker 2>That's how you showed up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Might by cutting your bolts off in front</v>

3619
02:37:06.851 --> 02:37:08.620
<v Speaker 2>of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

3620

<v Speaker 2>heard.</v>

3622
02:37:15.450 --> 02:37:15.450
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that can't be true.</v>

3623
02:37:15.450 --> 02:37:16.010
<v Speaker 2>I just made it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was like you son</v>

<v Speaker 4>They wouldn't cut the balls off like </v>

3627

<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>

3680
02:39:22.480 --> 02:39:23.830
<v Speaker 4>I never even thought of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I had this problem when I took,</v>

3681

<v Speaker 4>really tight much.</v>

<v Speaker 4>my jumper,</v>

3687
02:39:38.560 --> 02:39:40.250
<v Speaker 4>Asian roommate,</v>

<v Speaker 6>startups that he funds.</v>

3808
02:44:44.820 --> 02:44:48.040
<v Speaker 8>We are the ones who serve them coffee,</v>

<v Speaker 6>So even their fucking protesters were </v>

3816
02:45:05.220 --> 02:45:06.460
<v Speaker 6>smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 6>San Francisco is such a great place.</v>

3817
02:45:06.461 --> 02:45:08.980
<v Speaker 6>Definitely need to figure out a way to </v>
<v Speaker 6>keep the diversity,</v>

3818
02:45:09.610 --> 02:45:11.680
<v Speaker 6>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That we need to solve.</v>

3819
02:45:11.740 --> 02:45:12.650
<v Speaker 6>Rising runs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>CuTe.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Sepa,</v>
<v Speaker 6>san francisco's and crackdown on </v>

3821
02:45:17.970 --> 02:45:17.970

<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

3822
02:45:17.970 --> 02:45:18.520

<v Speaker 6>neighborhoods now,</v>

3823
02:45:18.521 --> 02:45:19.510
<v Speaker 6>there's so much money.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're like,</v>

3824
02:45:19.511 --> 02:45:22.960
<v Speaker 6>well we can charge more and get rid of.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so they have the gentrification,</v>

3825
02:45:22.961 --> 02:45:24.550
<v Speaker 6>which just means white people are here </v>
<v Speaker 6>now.</v>

3826
02:45:25.090 --> 02:45:30.090
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I now know like they don't have that </v>

3827
02:45:30.090 --> 02:45:30.220
<v Speaker 6>degenerate feel anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The hate of just doing what you want.</v>

3828
02:45:30.950 --> 02:45:31.460
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>

3829
02:45:32.710 --> 02:45:34.990
<v Speaker 6>I find it fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just as a,</v>

3830
02:45:35.180 --> 02:45:40.180
<v Speaker 6>a natuRal event was the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You can't find a place in williamsburg </v>

3831
02:45:40.180 --> 02:45:44.251
<v Speaker 6>to rent.</v>
<v Speaker 6>it used to be like the thing you did </v>

3832
02:45:44.251 --> 02:45:44.950
<v Speaker 6>because it was like cool,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but now it's like rents are too high.</v>

3833
02:45:44.950 --> 02:45:47.350
<v Speaker 6>Everyone knew where he got out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Isn't that fascinating though?</v>

3834
02:45:47.470 --> 02:45:49.270
<v Speaker 6>It's fascinating when things like that </v>
<v Speaker 6>happen,</v>

3835
02:45:49.720 --> 02:45:53.760
<v Speaker 6>like when you see a house like in san </v>
<v Speaker 6>francisco and it's $3,000,000,000</v>

3836
02:45:53.830 --> 02:45:55.840
<v Speaker 6>and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

3837
02:45:55.841 --> 02:46:00.841
<v Speaker 6>And then you try to figure out what are </v>
<v Speaker 6>you getting out of this 3 million bucks </v>

3838
02:46:00.841 --> 02:46:00.841
<v Speaker 6>location.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's it.</v>

3839
02:46:00.841 --> 02:46:05.190
<v Speaker 6>Like that house is not a god damn 3 </v>
<v Speaker 6>million downloads to somewhere else </v>

3840
02:46:05.190 --> 02:46:08.551

<v Speaker 6>else and it moves like the way deserts </v>

3841
02:46:08.551 --> 02:46:08.560
<v Speaker 6>move over,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like high speed of of years.</v>

3842
02:46:08.561 --> 02:46:10.520
<v Speaker 6>A year or Second.</v>

02:47:36.791 --> 02:47:37.130
<v Speaker 6>the traffic is bad,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so I decided to take a take the pch.</v>

3880
02:47:37.340 --> 02:47:41.460
<v Speaker 6>I just started to get off of the highway</v>
<v Speaker 6>and just take some street roads.</v>

3881
02:47:41.660 --> 02:47:43.820
<v Speaker 6>I tOok the pch over near malibu and I </v>
<v Speaker 6>was like,</v>

3882
02:47:43.850 --> 02:47:45.350
<v Speaker 6>god damn,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's beautiful here.</v>

3883
02:47:46.010 --> 02:47:47.660
<v Speaker 6>I always wonder if I could live there </v>
<v Speaker 6>though.</v>

3884
02:47:48.450 --> 02:47:53.450
<v Speaker 6>You don't have that dispensers nonstop.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like I'm living so close to the ocean </v>

3885
02:47:54.501 --> 02:47:57.650
<v Speaker 6>and then one day that earthquake tsunami</v>
<v Speaker 6>thing kind of just tear me up.</v>

3886
02:47:58.100 --> 02:48:00.140
<v Speaker 6>That's one way to look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I mean,</v>

3887
02:48:00.141 --> 02:48:01.100
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>
<v Speaker 6>let's be honest.</v>

3888
02:48:01.101 --> 02:48:06.101
<v Speaker 6>If the slept with both those earthworks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If the big earthquake happens right now </v>

3889
02:48:06.101 --> 02:48:06.650
<v Speaker 6>while we're in the studio,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're kind of fucked.</v>

3890
02:48:06.710 --> 02:48:11.710
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>most of the time you're driving away </v>

3891
02:48:11.710 --> 02:48:11.780
<v Speaker 6>from your house or you're not at home </v>
<v Speaker 6>when you're somewhere else.</v>

3892
02:48:12.060 --> 02:48:17.060
<v Speaker 6>You'd want to be on a cliff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We definitely don't want to be near the </v>

3893
02:48:17.060 --> 02:48:17.390
<v Speaker 6>water.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't want to be near the water.</v>

3894
02:48:17.391 --> 02:48:22.391
<v Speaker 6>You might be wanting to be on a cliff </v>
<v Speaker 6>better than you want to be on the wall </v>

3895
02:48:22.391 --> 02:48:22.940
<v Speaker 6>and hope it goes inland.</v>
