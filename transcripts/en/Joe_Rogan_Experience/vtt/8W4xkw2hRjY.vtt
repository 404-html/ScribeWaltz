00:04:05.741 --> 00:04:05.891
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

151
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:06.131
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

152
00:04:06.131 --> 00:04:08.530
<v Speaker 1>he's a appear this weekend at the punchline.</v>

153
00:04:08.531 --> 00:04:08.951
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

154
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:10.060
<v Speaker 1>if you're in Sacramento,</v>

155
00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:13.660
<v Speaker 1>he's one of the funniest fucking dudes is working today.</v>

156
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:14.620
<v Speaker 1>Fucking funny.</v>

157
00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.861
<v Speaker 1>Look good.</v>

158
00:04:14.861 --> 00:04:16.600
<v Speaker 1>He wrote me after I tweeted it to him.</v>

159
00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:17.623
<v Speaker 1>Oh</v>

160
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:19.150
<v Speaker 1>thanks man.</v>

161
00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:20.050
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be lucrative.</v>

162
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.680
<v Speaker 1>We're both laughing about it on the plane.</v>

163
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.340
<v Speaker 1>We couldn't stop saying it.</v>

164
00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:28.750
<v Speaker 1>How lucrative do you get,</v>

165
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.400
<v Speaker 1>cause I kept pretty low grid.</v>

166
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:32.383
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

167
00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:33.550
<v Speaker 1>You mean lucrative?</v>

168
00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.080
<v Speaker 2>It's really good to surround yourself with people who inspire you because they,</v>

169
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.860
<v Speaker 2>they talk about having a cognitive model for behavior change.</v>

170
00:04:41.861 --> 00:04:44.170
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're trying to get better in some way,</v>

171
00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:45.130
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

172
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.240
<v Speaker 2>if you can visual,</v>

173
00:04:46.241 --> 00:04:49.480
<v Speaker 2>if you know somebody who's already done it or doing positive things in their</v>

174
00:04:49.481 --> 00:04:50.170
<v Speaker 2>lives,</v>

175
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.650
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

176
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.250
<v Speaker 2>it requires less energy for your brain to imagine yourself doing it.</v>

177
00:04:54.251 --> 00:04:54.570
<v Speaker 2>Like if you're,</v>

178
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.791
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

179
00:04:54.791 --> 00:04:55.391
<v Speaker 2>if you don't,</v>

180
00:04:55.391 --> 00:04:57.760
<v Speaker 2>if you're not trying to be anybody who's trying to get healthy or trying to get</v>

181
00:04:57.761 --> 00:04:58.900
<v Speaker 2>fit or whatever it is,</v>

182
00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:00.010
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

183
00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.400
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

184
00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.200
<v Speaker 2>it's literally harder to imagine.</v>

185
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.580
<v Speaker 2>And so it's like more exhausting for you to try to imagine yourself getting</v>

186
00:05:06.581 --> 00:05:07.210
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>

187
00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.250
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you're surrounded by people who are doing it,</v>

188
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:10.870
<v Speaker 2>it becomes familiar to your brain.</v>

189
00:05:10.871 --> 00:05:13.630
<v Speaker 2>There's all sorts of examples that your brain can call on.</v>

190
00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:14.050
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

191
00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.250
<v Speaker 2>it literally takes less energy for you to imagine yourself actually doing it.</v>

192
00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:19.540
<v Speaker 2>And weirdly,</v>

193
00:05:19.541 --> 00:05:22.360
<v Speaker 2>they found at Stanford University using,</v>

194
00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

195
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:23.590
<v Speaker 2>like avatars.</v>

196
00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.520
<v Speaker 2>If you can see an Avatar that is designed to look like you,</v>

197
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.650
<v Speaker 2>like doing the sort of things you want to do,</v>

198
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:30.251
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>

199
00:05:30.251 --> 00:05:31.240
<v Speaker 2>being really physically fit,</v>

200
00:05:31.241 --> 00:05:32.670
<v Speaker 2>like working out in the game world.</v>

201
00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.550
<v Speaker 2>If you just watch an avatar custom design to look like you doing that,</v>

202
00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.760
<v Speaker 2>it lowers the cognitive threshold for you to do it.</v>

203
00:05:39.761 --> 00:05:41.830
<v Speaker 2>And then you will do more in real life.</v>

204
00:05:41.831 --> 00:05:42.161
<v Speaker 2>You'll like,</v>

205
00:05:42.161 --> 00:05:42.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

206
00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.820
<v Speaker 2>you will work out more or you'll spend more time committed to those goals just</v>

207
00:05:48.281 --> 00:05:52.600
<v Speaker 2>by having watched this sort of mirror version of yourself having done it.</v>

208
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.440
<v Speaker 1>But he's that guy now that really is who he is.</v>

209
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.060
<v Speaker 1>He's like all the time,</v>

210
00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.810
<v Speaker 1>four hours.</v>

211
00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 1>You call</v>

212
00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.910
<v Speaker 3>him up in the middle of the night.</v>

213
00:05:58.911 --> 00:05:59.744
<v Speaker 3>He's dice man.</v>

214
00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:00.451
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

215
00:06:00.451 --> 00:06:01.460
<v Speaker 3>He became that guy.</v>

216
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.301
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

217
00:06:02.301 --> 00:06:03.134
<v Speaker 3>We uh,</v>

218
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.880
<v Speaker 3>I opened up for him for like two,</v>

219
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:05.721
<v Speaker 3>three years.</v>

220
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:06.481
<v Speaker 3>He really,</v>

221
00:06:06.481 --> 00:06:06.740
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

222
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.900
<v Speaker 3>he picked me out of the comedy story.</v>

223
00:06:08.901 --> 00:06:10.530
<v Speaker 3>He came up to me and uh,</v>

224
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:11.750
<v Speaker 3>at first he goes,</v>

225
00:06:11.751 --> 00:06:12.584
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

226
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:13.730
<v Speaker 3>you know what you should do.</v>

227
00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:14.470
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>

228
00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:15.303
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

229
00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:17.270
<v Speaker 3>When you go on stage,</v>

230
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.070
<v Speaker 3>put a sack</v>

231
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:26.030
<v Speaker 3>pants and then you'll be like the comedian who's just got a big cock</v>

232
00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:28.610
<v Speaker 3>and this is like,</v>

233
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.950
<v Speaker 3>this is like my guy I looked up to</v>

234
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:33.470
<v Speaker 3>and he's telling me.</v>

235
00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:35.510
<v Speaker 3>And then I actually went home that night,</v>

236
00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:36.344
<v Speaker 3>gone.</v>

237
00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:37.293
<v Speaker 3>Should I do,</v>

238
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:40.630
<v Speaker 3>should I be cat gay?</v>

239
00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.320
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

240
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:43.483
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

241
00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:45.411
<v Speaker 3>anyway,</v>

242
00:06:45.411 --> 00:06:47.180
<v Speaker 3>we was just kind of beard,</v>

243
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:48.140
<v Speaker 3>little friendship.</v>

244
00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:52.520
<v Speaker 3>And he asked me if I wanted to go to Las Vegas with him at the Stardust hotel</v>

245
00:06:52.521 --> 00:06:53.354
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>

246
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:54.680

249
00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:58.041

252
00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:00.260
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

253
00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.980
<v Speaker 3>So they all came out to see and I hung out with them on the road.</v>

254
00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.810
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

255
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.040
<v Speaker 3>the first time we played Vegas,</v>

256
00:07:07.041 --> 00:07:07.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

257
00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:08.930
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe I'm here.</v>

258
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.370
<v Speaker 3>Wayne Newton theater.</v>

259
00:07:10.371 --> 00:07:11.600
<v Speaker 3>I wonder what we're going to do,</v>

260
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:11.900
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

261
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.310
<v Speaker 3>excited and we'll go,</v>

262
00:07:13.311 --> 00:07:16.400
<v Speaker 3>probably go out dinner and we'll go out to a club,</v>

263
00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.320
<v Speaker 3>hang by the pool,</v>

264
00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:19.480
<v Speaker 3>probably got a Cabana.</v>

265
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:21.490
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

266
00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:22.323
<v Speaker 3>we'll go and grow.</v>

267
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.710
<v Speaker 3>We're going to furniture shopping today.</v>

268
00:07:24.890 --> 00:07:25.220
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

269
00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:26.053
<v Speaker 3>Huh.</v>

270
00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.410
<v Speaker 3>And Las Vegas.</v>

271
00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:31.790
<v Speaker 3>So we went furniture shopping because he had a house out there and he was</v>

272
00:07:31.791 --> 00:07:33.080
<v Speaker 3>furnishing his house.</v>

273
00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:36.140
<v Speaker 3>So we would go to furniture stores and he would told me,</v>

274
00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.670
<v Speaker 3>sit on the couch.</v>

275
00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:38.653
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

276
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:39.913
<v Speaker 3>When you think,</v>

277
00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:42.350
<v Speaker 3>say grand guy,</v>

278
00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.640
<v Speaker 3>it's better than anything.</v>

279
00:07:43.641 --> 00:07:44.930
<v Speaker 3>I got it at my house.</v>

280
00:07:44.931 --> 00:07:45.920
<v Speaker 3>It's fantastic.</v>

281
00:07:45.921 --> 00:07:47.510
<v Speaker 3>And we would go to eat.</v>

282
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:49.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean this was a process.</v>

283
00:07:49.281 --> 00:07:51.020
<v Speaker 3>We were laying on carpets.</v>

284
00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.370
<v Speaker 3>I just see if the carpet was comfortable and uh,</v>

285
00:07:55.371 --> 00:07:55.990
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

286
00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:56.750
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

287
00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:57.231
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

288
00:07:57.231 --> 00:07:58.190
<v Speaker 3>I guess this is what you,</v>

289
00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:58.971
<v Speaker 3>you do.</v>

290
00:07:58.971 --> 00:08:02.630
<v Speaker 3>This is my first time on the road and were furniture shop,</v>

291
00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.960
<v Speaker 3>but let's go on.</v>

292
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:05.260
<v Speaker 3>Then I made it a casino.</v>

293
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:06.350
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we go for dinner and he's like,</v>

294
00:08:06.351 --> 00:08:07.184
<v Speaker 3>are you kidding me?</v>

295
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:08.660
