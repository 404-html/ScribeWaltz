00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.360
<v Speaker 1>Here we go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.940
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.373
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

4
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:09.930
<v Speaker 2>And we're live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gentlemen,</v>

5
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.340
<v Speaker 2>thanks for being here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Appreciate it.</v>

6
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.140
<v Speaker 2>Let everybody know who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lane.</v>

7
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.770
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a meathead who likes science,</v>

8
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.760
<v Speaker 2>got no bodybuilding when I was young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

9
00:00:20.761 --> 00:00:24.840
<v Speaker 2>and then did a bs in biochemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>phd in Nutritional Science.</v>

10
00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.420
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kept lifting,</v>

11
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.170
<v Speaker 2>did powerlifting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>won two national championships,</v>

12
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.043
<v Speaker 2>got silver medal at worlds within worlds</v>
<v Speaker 2>squat record and it also bodybuilding </v>

13
00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:38.660
<v Speaker 2>and one of the natural pro card.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They actually have natural bodybuilding,</v>

14
00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.970
<v Speaker 2>believe it or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

15
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.040
<v Speaker 2>throughout that time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just know when I first got into it,</v>

16
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.173
<v Speaker 2>one magazine said one thing and even in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same magazine they have an article </v>

17
00:00:47.971 --> 00:00:50.010
<v Speaker 2>one month next month that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>contradicted.</v>

18
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.513
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to try and figure this </v>

19
00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:53.910
<v Speaker 2>shit out for myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

20
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.330
<v Speaker 2>which is the place that a lot of people </v>
<v Speaker 2>listening are at right now.</v>

21
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.343
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's,</v>

22
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.020
<v Speaker 2>it's tough because it's kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who do you trust because,</v>

23
00:01:01.021 --> 00:01:03.300
<v Speaker 2>nope,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not everybody has the time or the energy</v>

24
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.460
<v Speaker 2>to go and do a degree in this stuff.</v>

25
00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.050
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that was me.</v>

26
00:01:07.051 --> 00:01:09.450
<v Speaker 2>I kinda got down the rabbit hole of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

27
00:01:09.451 --> 00:01:11.400
<v Speaker 2>let's try and figure this nutrition </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff out.</v>

28
00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.280
<v Speaker 2>And of course the more I learn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more I realized I didn't know.</v>

29
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.110
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

30
00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:18.570
<v Speaker 2>it just became a passion for me to enter</v>
<v Speaker 2>this day.</v>

31
00:01:18.571 --> 00:01:20.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm still very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love this stuff.</v>

32
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.740
<v Speaker 2>This is what gets me up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets me going.</v>

33
00:01:22.741 --> 00:01:23.574
<v Speaker 2>Well guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you are very important guys who </v>

34
00:01:25.021 --> 00:01:25.854
<v Speaker 2>actually trained very hard and really </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand the science this is because </v>

35
00:01:29.461 --> 00:01:30.870
<v Speaker 2>it's usually one or the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

36
00:01:30.871 --> 00:01:31.760
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

37
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.903
<v Speaker 2>And I like when I was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I graduated my phd in 2010 when we </v>

38
00:01:37.381 --> 00:01:38.214
<v Speaker 2>started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We actually both knew each other from </v>

39
00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:41.400
<v Speaker 2>the bodybuilding.com</v>
<v Speaker 2>message boards,</v>

40
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.110
<v Speaker 2>so that was back before social media</v>

41
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.630
<v Speaker 3>trained together back in 2006 or seven</v>

42
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.200
<v Speaker 2>seven and experimental biology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this big,</v>

43
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.363
<v Speaker 2>there's a big symposium every year for </v>
<v Speaker 2>science geeks and we were both going to </v>

44
00:01:53.151 --> 00:01:53.984
<v Speaker 2>it and we found out about each other on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the forums and we went and trained </v>

45
00:01:56.901 --> 00:01:58.430
<v Speaker 2>together and he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a beast.</v>

46
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:00.290
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

47
00:02:00.291 --> 00:02:01.124
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we really hit it off and we've been </v>

48
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.253
<v Speaker 2>friends since then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for everybody who's looking for a </v>

49
00:02:04.941 --> 00:02:06.180
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so sorry,</v>

50
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.030
<v Speaker 2>we're probably going to be pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>friendly.</v>

51
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.560
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be a conversation.</v>

52
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.350
<v Speaker 2>We don't need to have a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dom,</v>

53
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.423
<v Speaker 2>you've been on the podcast before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for people didn't listen to that </v>

54
00:02:14.421 --> 00:02:15.254
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please tell them who you are and what </v>

55
00:02:15.771 --> 00:02:16.270
<v Speaker 2>you do.</v>

56
00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.081
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

57
00:02:17.081 --> 00:02:18.550
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>keep this sucker google.</v>

58
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.971
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

59
00:02:18.971 --> 00:02:19.910
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

60
00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.640
<v Speaker 3>I will go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Getting back,</v>

61
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:22.493
<v Speaker 3>I majored in nutrition actually as an </v>
<v Speaker 3>Undergrad but didn't actually see a </v>

62
00:02:24.701 --> 00:02:27.730
<v Speaker 3>career in it that much.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I went into neuroscience,</v>

63
00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.940
<v Speaker 3>the net 90,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's a decade of the brain and uh,</v>

64
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:31.803
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my formal training is in neuroscience </v>

65
00:02:33.641 --> 00:02:34.474
<v Speaker 3>and it got steered towards basically </v>
<v Speaker 3>changing the neuropharmacology of the </v>

66
00:02:37.781 --> 00:02:38.614
<v Speaker 3>brain with nutrition and that's what the</v>
<v Speaker 3>key to genic diet does and it has </v>

67
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.910
<v Speaker 3>tremendous benefits I think for military</v>
<v Speaker 3>personnel,</v>

68
00:02:45.911 --> 00:02:46.480
<v Speaker 3>which is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

69
00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.830
<v Speaker 3>funded by the office of navy research </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the Department of Defense to develop</v>

70
00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.310
<v Speaker 3>ketogenic strategies to enhance </v>
<v Speaker 3>readiness,</v>

71
00:02:54.311 --> 00:02:58.690
<v Speaker 3>a resilience and performance and safety </v>
<v Speaker 3>and military personnel.</v>

72
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 3>And what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what did,</v>

73
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.090
<v Speaker 3>why specifically does the key to genic </v>
<v Speaker 3>diet helped military people?</v>

74
00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:08.550
<v Speaker 3>I know there's a thing with a navy seals</v>
<v Speaker 3>with preventing epilepsy.</v>

75
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so a central nervous system,</v>

76
00:03:11.171 --> 00:03:12.004
<v Speaker 3>oxygen toxicity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a limitation of that is a limitation of </v>

77
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:16.084
<v Speaker 3>navy seal diving is oxygen toxicity </v>
<v Speaker 3>seizures and a antiepileptic drugs are </v>

78
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:22.720
<v Speaker 3>not really a viable option because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>can,</v>

79
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.600
<v Speaker 3>their side effects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can decrease cognitive resilience,</v>

80
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.453
<v Speaker 3>physical resilience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it key to jenks strategy is something </v>

81
00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:31.294
<v Speaker 3>that's being studied now from a basic </v>
<v Speaker 3>science mechanistic perspective to </v>

82
00:03:34.061 --> 00:03:35.800
<v Speaker 3>animal work to now human studies.</v>

83
00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:37.770
<v Speaker 3>So it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

84
00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:38.763
<v Speaker 3>out in the field yet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but some guys are actually doing it and </v>

85
00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:45.760
<v Speaker 3>I studied the science of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so when people don't understand what</v>

86
00:03:45.761 --> 00:03:46.640
<v Speaker 3>we're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

87
00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.553
<v Speaker 3>for some folks who have epilepsy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ketogenic diet has been shown to </v>

88
00:03:50.351 --> 00:03:51.820
<v Speaker 3>stop seizures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

89
00:03:51.821 --> 00:03:55.930
<v Speaker 3>Go Google the Charlie Foundation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's how I actually got linkedin.</v>

90
00:03:55.931 --> 00:03:58.770
<v Speaker 3>And actually I met a natural drug free </v>
<v Speaker 3>bodybuilder.</v>

91
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.830
<v Speaker 3>His name was Mike Dancer and he had </v>
<v Speaker 3>severe terminal epilepsy,</v>

92
00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.360
<v Speaker 3>Google,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike Dancer,</v>

93
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:07.630
<v Speaker 3>Ketogenic Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you'll find an amazing story about a</v>

94
00:04:07.631 --> 00:04:08.464
<v Speaker 3>guy who used nutrition to manage his </v>
<v Speaker 3>epilepsy when drugs failed and he used </v>

95
00:04:13.631 --> 00:04:14.464
<v Speaker 3>it to prep and when bodybuilding shows </v>
<v Speaker 3>and compete in bodybuilding and the </v>

96
00:04:17.411 --> 00:04:22.411
<v Speaker 3>rebreathers sometimes caused seizures </v>
<v Speaker 3>with some of the soldiers they can.</v>

97
00:04:22.841 --> 00:04:23.650
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

98
00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.620
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just 50 feet of sea water using a closed</v>

99
00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:28.950
<v Speaker 3>circuit rebreather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a drager,</v>

100
00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.720
<v Speaker 3>rebreathers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>50 feet of seawater.</v>

101
00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:31.603
<v Speaker 3>Your potential for getting oxygen </v>
<v Speaker 3>toxicity seizures can occur in just 10 </v>

102
00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:35.674
<v Speaker 3>minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's a little bit of time and </v>

103
00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:37.714
<v Speaker 3>that's not very deep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's no way to predict that and </v>

104
00:04:40.421 --> 00:04:42.430
<v Speaker 3>there's no way as of now to prevent </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

105
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.353
<v Speaker 3>So we study physiological biomarkers </v>
<v Speaker 3>that could warn people of an impending </v>

106
00:04:47.051 --> 00:04:47.884
<v Speaker 3>seizure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we also develop countermeasures to </v>

107
00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:53.980
<v Speaker 3>mitigate oxygen toxicity seizures.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I focus mostly on drugs.</v>

108
00:04:53.981 --> 00:04:56.650
<v Speaker 3>I'm in a pharmacology and physiology </v>
<v Speaker 3>department,</v>

109
00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.950
<v Speaker 3>but I realized that people with </v>
<v Speaker 3>epilepsy,</v>

110
00:04:59.951 --> 00:05:01.840
<v Speaker 3>the ketogenic diet was more effective </v>
<v Speaker 3>than drugs.</v>

111
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.030
<v Speaker 3>So I got steered into,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

112
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.770
<v Speaker 3>nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was my undergrad.</v>

113
00:05:05.771 --> 00:05:06.604
<v Speaker 3>And then that kicked off about 10 years </v>
<v Speaker 3>ago and I've just been deep into </v>

114
00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.570
<v Speaker 3>probably a dozen or more different </v>
<v Speaker 3>applications of nutritional ketosis.</v>

115
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:14.583
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And laying up and paying attention to </v>

116
00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:16.564
<v Speaker 3>online for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the things you do a great job </v>

117
00:05:18.581 --> 00:05:21.400
<v Speaker 3>with is just calling bullshit on.</v>

118
00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you loved call bullshit clearly,</v>

119
00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.640
<v Speaker 3>but whenever people are overstating </v>
<v Speaker 3>claims or people get ridiculous,</v>

120
00:05:27.641 --> 00:05:28.474
<v Speaker 3>and I think this is one of the things </v>
<v Speaker 3>that is a problem with any diet where </v>

121
00:05:31.721 --> 00:05:35.740
<v Speaker 3>people get really enthusiastic about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That becomes an ideology.</v>

122
00:05:35.741 --> 00:05:38.930
<v Speaker 3>Whether it's the key to genic died or </v>
<v Speaker 3>the carnivore diet or the,</v>

123
00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:40.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fill in the blanks,</v>

124
00:05:40.511 --> 00:05:41.344
<v Speaker 3>Vegan Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People decide this is the end all be </v>

125
00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.490
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to cure cancer.</v>

126
00:05:45.491 --> 00:05:47.410
<v Speaker 3>Make you smarter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dick's going to grow a foot.</v>

127
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:48.693
<v Speaker 3>All these things are gonna happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you do a great job of calling </v>

128
00:05:51.161 --> 00:05:53.680
<v Speaker 3>bullshit on that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

129
00:05:53.681 --> 00:05:54.310
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

130
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:56.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm not anti Quito,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not anti.</v>

131
00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm anti</v>

132
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.813
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the problems we have is </v>

133
00:06:01.671 --> 00:06:04.070
<v Speaker 2>nutrition is replacing religion for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of people.</v>

134
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.490
<v Speaker 2>So you find something that you identify </v>
<v Speaker 2>with and then people start to try to say</v>

135
00:06:10.941 --> 00:06:13.970
<v Speaker 2>because they identify with that movement</v>
<v Speaker 2>or like for example,</v>

136
00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:16.400
<v Speaker 2>vegans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they identify with many of them.</v>

137
00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.840
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>protection of animals,</v>

138
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:20.570
<v Speaker 2>not my job to judge their ethics on that</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of thing,</v>

139
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:22.213
<v Speaker 2>but then they kind of tried to backtrack</v>
<v Speaker 2>to find the science to support them as </v>

140
00:06:24.861 --> 00:06:27.380
<v Speaker 2>well and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they pick and choose.</v>

141
00:06:27.381 --> 00:06:29.180
<v Speaker 2>And this is guilty of all groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just vegans.</v>

142
00:06:29.181 --> 00:06:31.580
<v Speaker 2>This is also a lot of key digital diet </v>
<v Speaker 2>cell.</v>

143
00:06:31.581 --> 00:06:34.640
<v Speaker 2>It's a carnivore diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever have you.</v>

144
00:06:34.641 --> 00:06:35.474
<v Speaker 2>If it has the word diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's zealots out there who are going </v>

145
00:06:38.301 --> 00:06:42.950
<v Speaker 2>after it and I will stick up for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've stuck up at a scientific conference</v>

146
00:06:42.951 --> 00:06:43.910
<v Speaker 2>for the key to genic diet.</v>

147
00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.140
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were,</v>

148
00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.740
<v Speaker 2>we were having a round table about </v>
<v Speaker 2>something different and somebody said,</v>

149
00:06:48.741 --> 00:06:49.574
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know that the ketogenic diet in </v>

150
00:06:50.451 --> 00:06:52.730
<v Speaker 2>prayers exercise performance and </v>
<v Speaker 2>endurance athletes.</v>

151
00:06:52.731 --> 00:06:56.040
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's necessarily true of</v>

152
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:57.343
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty ambivalent or ambiguous as </v>

153
00:07:00.321 --> 00:07:02.810
<v Speaker 2>to whether or not it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems to be kind of individual.</v>

154
00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:04.700
<v Speaker 2>But on the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the average,</v>

155
00:07:04.701 --> 00:07:06.770
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't seem to impair exercise </v>
<v Speaker 2>performance.</v>

156
00:07:06.771 --> 00:07:09.980
<v Speaker 2>So it's kind of what you like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But when you have people who,</v>

157
00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:10.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

158
00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:12.260
<v Speaker 2>like a Gary Taubes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who says,</v>

159
00:07:12.261 --> 00:07:13.580
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calories don't matter.</v>

160
00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.780
<v Speaker 2>It's all carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of thing of the carbohydrate,</v>

161
00:07:17.781 --> 00:07:22.100
<v Speaker 2>insulin model of obesity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the research is you're able to do</v>

162
00:07:22.101 --> 00:07:26.660
<v Speaker 2>a lot of hand waving about insulin and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you burn so much fat,</v>

163
00:07:26.661 --> 00:07:29.090
<v Speaker 2>when you're on a high fat diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is true by the way you,</v>

164
00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:29.993
<v Speaker 2>you burn a lot of fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what they don't talk about is that </v>

165
00:07:31.581 --> 00:07:32.414
<v Speaker 2>it's it's overall fat balance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much fat you store versus how much </v>

166
00:07:37.041 --> 00:07:39.500
<v Speaker 2>fat you burn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you're on a high fat diet,</v>

167
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.020
<v Speaker 2>you store a lot of fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you also burn a lot of fat.</v>

168
00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:42.913
<v Speaker 2>The overall caloric balance is what </v>
<v Speaker 2>determines whether or not you will have </v>

169
00:07:45.621 --> 00:07:49.670
<v Speaker 2>net storage or net deposition in St </v>
<v Speaker 2>Louis for high carb Diet as well.</v>

170
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:50.923
<v Speaker 2>You know this idea that with high </v>
<v Speaker 2>insulin it just completely shuts down </v>

171
00:07:54.291 --> 00:07:57.110
<v Speaker 2>all fat burning everywhere that that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>just not true.</v>

172
00:07:57.111 --> 00:07:59.630
<v Speaker 2>Now if you have high carbohydrate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will burn less fat,</v>

173
00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.030
<v Speaker 2>but you're also storing less fat as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

174
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:03.373
<v Speaker 2>and again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the net caloric balance is going to be </v>

175
00:08:05.181 --> 00:08:06.014
<v Speaker 2>what determines how much you store </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you don't really store </v>

176
00:08:09.621 --> 00:08:11.810
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates as fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For most people,</v>

177
00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:12.703
<v Speaker 2>they did a study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a overfeeding women where they overfed </v>

178
00:08:16.011 --> 00:08:16.844
<v Speaker 2>them 50 percent above their caloric </v>
<v Speaker 2>maintenance and they found that of 282 </v>

179
00:08:19.971 --> 00:08:22.460
<v Speaker 2>grams of fat that they stored during the</v>
<v Speaker 2>day and adipose.</v>

180
00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:26.630
<v Speaker 2>Only four grams came from carbohydrate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two hundred and 78 came from fat,</v>

181
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:28.950
<v Speaker 3>so glucose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about fructose?</v>

182
00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:33.450
<v Speaker 3>Fructose causes we think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nonalcoholic fatty liver disease,</v>

183
00:08:33.451 --> 00:08:34.670
<v Speaker 3>so that could be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

184
00:08:35.290 --> 00:08:36.123
<v Speaker 3>Denovo Denovo lipogenesis is higher with</v>
<v Speaker 3>fructose and you're thinking about </v>

185
00:08:40.051 --> 00:08:44.100
<v Speaker 3>people consuming it in a liquid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>drinks a 100 to 200 grams a day,</v>

186
00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:46.470
<v Speaker 3>which is not uncommon even for my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not uncommon,</v>

187
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:51.680
<v Speaker 2>so fructose does seem to have a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit of different hepatic metabolism,</v>

188
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.333
<v Speaker 2>but I was actually across the hall from </v>
<v Speaker 2>a professor who was doing a lot of the </v>

189
00:08:56.581 --> 00:08:57.414
<v Speaker 2>research on fructose and obesity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fatty liver disease and even he came to </v>

190
00:09:01.291 --> 00:09:02.124
<v Speaker 2>the conclusion that if you overfeed </v>
<v Speaker 2>fruit dose and it creates a caloric </v>

191
00:09:06.031 --> 00:09:09.900
<v Speaker 2>surplus and you're overfeeding for dose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you can have some wonky stuff start</v>

192
00:09:09.901 --> 00:09:12.170
<v Speaker 2>to go on relative to other macros.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Die.</v>

193
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:13.013
<v Speaker 2>Try to keep this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>try to keep this right next to your </v>

194
00:09:14.011 --> 00:09:15.140
<v Speaker 2>face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Got It.</v>

195
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:16.620
<v Speaker 2>Cause that's what she said is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful.</v>

196
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:19.620
<v Speaker 2>I talk loud and a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good.</v>

197
00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:22.050
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you're,</v>

198
00:09:22.051 --> 00:09:25.920
<v Speaker 2>if you're doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're creating that caloric surplus,</v>

199
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.980
<v Speaker 2>what you find is when you're in net </v>
<v Speaker 2>storage,</v>

200
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:34.100
<v Speaker 2>when you're driving more nutrients into </v>
<v Speaker 2>adipose and sometimes liver depending on</v>

201
00:09:35.641 --> 00:09:36.720
<v Speaker 2>metabolism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it takes,</v>

202
00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.760
<v Speaker 2>it takes a lot of fructose to do that.</v>

203
00:09:38.910 --> 00:09:43.200
<v Speaker 2>And a caloric surplus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start to create a lot of wonky stuff</v>

204
00:09:43.201 --> 00:09:44.034
<v Speaker 2>going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Mitochondria starts to become </v>

205
00:09:45.961 --> 00:09:48.840
<v Speaker 2>dysfunctional and people make a big deal</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

206
00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:49.980
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you have,</v>

207
00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:52.890
<v Speaker 2>we have claimed now that everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>causes,</v>

208
00:09:53.110 --> 00:09:55.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obesity and type two diabetes.</v>

209
00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:57.300
<v Speaker 2>For,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for first it was fats,</v>

210
00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.153
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's actually a professors out </v>

211
00:10:00.211 --> 00:10:02.220
<v Speaker 2>there who actually will claim the </v>
<v Speaker 2>protein gives you diabetes.</v>

212
00:10:02.221 --> 00:10:03.780
<v Speaker 2>And it's type something for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I mean,</v>

213
00:10:03.781 --> 00:10:07.200
<v Speaker 2>the Mitochondria becomes dysfunctional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does the Mitochondrial,</v>

214
00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:09.480
<v Speaker 2>how does that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

215
00:10:09.481 --> 00:10:12.510
<v Speaker 2>so I'm going to state for everybody that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going out on a limb.</v>

216
00:10:12.511 --> 00:10:14.010
<v Speaker 2>This is my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

217
00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:19.320
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the research on obesity </v>
<v Speaker 2>and diabetes,</v>

218
00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.480
<v Speaker 2>what happens is you have everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>start to elevate in the bloodstream,</v>

219
00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:25.463
<v Speaker 2>so if you measure like there was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>professor who thought that branch chain </v>

220
00:10:27.601 --> 00:10:28.434
<v Speaker 2>amino acids were causing obesity because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were elevated in the blood stream </v>

221
00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.880
<v Speaker 2>during or sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during type two diabetes,</v>

222
00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:36.300
<v Speaker 2>well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>branched chain amino acids are elevated,</v>

223
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.210
<v Speaker 2>so fatty acids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so triacylglycerides,</v>

224
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:40.403
<v Speaker 2>so as glucose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so is it really those things causing it </v>

225
00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:44.843
<v Speaker 2>or is it possible that when you are </v>
<v Speaker 2>overfeeding relative to what you burn </v>

226
00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:50.003
<v Speaker 2>relative to that turnover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Mitochondria start to become </v>

227
00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:54.203
<v Speaker 2>dysfunctional?</v>

228
00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:59.460
<v Speaker 2>Probably a lot due to inactivity and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mitochondria is,</v>

229
00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.800
<v Speaker 2>as we call it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the powerhouse of the cell.</v>

230
00:11:01.801 --> 00:11:02.634
<v Speaker 2>As you probably learned in high school </v>
<v Speaker 2>biology or whatever they taught it to </v>

231
00:11:05.041 --> 00:11:08.730
<v Speaker 2>you as that is where everything fluxes </v>
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>

232
00:11:08.790 --> 00:11:09.623
<v Speaker 2>So that is where you're creating ATP.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where you're burning through </v>

233
00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.160
<v Speaker 2>lipids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates,</v>

234
00:11:14.250 --> 00:11:17.370
<v Speaker 2>that sort of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that becomes dysfunctional and you're</v>

235
00:11:17.371 --> 00:11:20.880
<v Speaker 2>not getting in a flux enough pull </v>
<v Speaker 2>through that Mitochondria,</v>

236
00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:25.020
<v Speaker 2>what happens is you start to back up </v>
<v Speaker 2>every part of metabolism,</v>

237
00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:26.123
<v Speaker 2>so all the metabolic byproducts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost all of them inhibit everything </v>

238
00:11:29.251 --> 00:11:31.740
<v Speaker 2>within the cell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a metabolomic signature for that</v>

239
00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:32.653
<v Speaker 2>and Epi phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to call it that would be </v>

240
00:11:34.771 --> 00:11:38.220
<v Speaker 2>elevated branched chain amino acids </v>
<v Speaker 2>because the consequence of that and some</v>

241
00:11:38.221 --> 00:11:40.950
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so these things start these byproducts,</v>

242
00:11:40.951 --> 00:11:41.784
<v Speaker 2>these metabolic byproducts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're not flexing enough </v>

243
00:11:43.351 --> 00:11:44.184
<v Speaker 2>through the cell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They start accumulating within the cell </v>

244
00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:46.913
<v Speaker 2>and start to inhibit the krebs cycle </v>
<v Speaker 2>glycolysis and so everything starts </v>

245
00:11:50.131 --> 00:11:50.964
<v Speaker 2>backing up to the point where you also </v>
<v Speaker 2>start inhibiting the insulin receptor </v>

246
00:11:54.730 --> 00:11:58.510
<v Speaker 2>and now you have glucose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fatty acids and amino acids.</v>

247
00:11:58.600 --> 00:11:59.433
<v Speaker 2>Also backing up to the point where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>start to overspill into the bloodstream </v>

248
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:03.843
<v Speaker 2>and you see these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this accumulation of all of them in the </v>

249
00:12:07.331 --> 00:12:12.331
<v Speaker 2>bloodstream in type two diabetes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I actually think that again,</v>

250
00:12:12.671 --> 00:12:16.570
<v Speaker 2>me going out on a limb that obesity </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't cause type two diabetes and type</v>

251
00:12:16.571 --> 00:12:17.404
<v Speaker 2>two diabetes doesn't cause obesity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That they develop in concert from the </v>

252
00:12:20.681 --> 00:12:23.560
<v Speaker 2>same problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is overfeeding under activity,</v>

253
00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:24.993
<v Speaker 2>so a lot of it is about how much </v>
<v Speaker 2>nutrients you're fluxing into cells </v>

254
00:12:29.051 --> 00:12:32.830
<v Speaker 2>versus how much energy you're creating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fluxing them through the cell on out,</v>

255
00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:35.710
<v Speaker 2>so when you're overfeeding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it be carbohydrate,</v>

256
00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:39.310
<v Speaker 2>fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your fluxing more energy in than you can</v>

257
00:12:39.311 --> 00:12:40.144
<v Speaker 2>dispose of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now you have to do something with </v>

258
00:12:42.581 --> 00:12:43.121
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

259
00:12:43.121 --> 00:12:43.954
<v Speaker 2>when you run out of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you do that much to it and </v>

260
00:12:47.141 --> 00:12:48.850
<v Speaker 2>Mitochondria start to become </v>
<v Speaker 2>dysfunctional,</v>

261
00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:50.343
<v Speaker 2>dysfunctional,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start to not have enough places to </v>

262
00:12:52.661 --> 00:12:53.494
<v Speaker 2>put it away and it starts spilling into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bloodstream and now you cause all </v>

263
00:12:55.451 --> 00:12:56.284
<v Speaker 2>kinds of problems.</v>

264
00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:57.423
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things that we really </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to talk about here is high carb </v>

265
00:13:00.341 --> 00:13:04.450
<v Speaker 2>versus low carb because this is a just a</v>
<v Speaker 2>giant point of contention today.</v>

266
00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:05.284
<v Speaker 2>Nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in terms of athletes with </v>

267
00:13:08.141 --> 00:13:10.930
<v Speaker 2>performance in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a big factor.</v>

268
00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.300
<v Speaker 2>Whether or not high carb or low carb is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way to go.</v>

269
00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:14.283
<v Speaker 2>And there's a lot of zealots on both </v>
<v Speaker 2>sides and there's a lot of bullshit and </v>

270
00:13:16.331 --> 00:13:17.164
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of online experts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the great thing about </v>

271
00:13:20.351 --> 00:13:21.184
<v Speaker 2>bringing you two guys in here is because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could really actually explained the </v>

272
00:13:23.681 --> 00:13:24.514
<v Speaker 2>science behind it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you've been great lane at pointing </v>

273
00:13:29.171 --> 00:13:32.530
<v Speaker 2>out that there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a magic bullet and you know,</v>

274
00:13:32.531 --> 00:13:37.030
<v Speaker 2>and so many people like to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stress it that way,</v>

275
00:13:37.031 --> 00:13:37.864
<v Speaker 2>that they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they like to portray ketogenic diet is </v>

276
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:40.571
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it,</v>

277
00:13:40.571 --> 00:13:41.680
<v Speaker 2>this is the end all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be all.</v>

278
00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:42.513
<v Speaker 2>I figured out what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the way everyone should be </v>

279
00:13:44.261 --> 00:13:46.060
<v Speaker 2>eating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't think so?</v>

280
00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.033
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you look at the weight loss </v>

281
00:13:50.531 --> 00:13:53.230
<v Speaker 2>problem in our society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

282
00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:54.153
<v Speaker 2>and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm writing a book called fat loss </v>

283
00:13:55.121 --> 00:13:57.370
<v Speaker 2>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I talk about this in detail,</v>

284
00:13:57.790 --> 00:13:58.623
<v Speaker 2>we don't have a weight loss problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Six out of every seven people were able </v>

285
00:14:01.301 --> 00:14:02.134
<v Speaker 2>to lose a significant amount of body </v>
<v Speaker 2>weight in their life who are obese or </v>

286
00:14:04.541 --> 00:14:05.374
<v Speaker 2>overweight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem is the weight regained </v>

287
00:14:07.331 --> 00:14:10.530
<v Speaker 2>statistics are absolutely terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

288
00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.420
<v Speaker 2>within one year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>70 percent will put it all back on.</v>

289
00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:17.920
<v Speaker 2>Within two years it's 85 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Within three years it's 95 percent.</v>

290
00:14:17.921 --> 00:14:22.510
<v Speaker 2>So that means diets have a 95 percent </v>
<v Speaker 2>failure rate and of those people,</v>

291
00:14:22.511 --> 00:14:23.344
<v Speaker 2>one third to two thirds will add more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than they originally lost and this gets </v>

292
00:14:27.011 --> 00:14:29.410
<v Speaker 2>kind of into Yoyo dieting and I talked </v>
<v Speaker 2>about that as well.</v>

293
00:14:29.830 --> 00:14:30.663
<v Speaker 2>But the real problem is that people </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't stick to pick something that's </v>

294
00:14:36.431 --> 00:14:40.510
<v Speaker 2>sustainable for them all the recert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there's one bit of research out there</v>

295
00:14:40.511 --> 00:14:41.344
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we have that shows how to create </v>

296
00:14:43.781 --> 00:14:44.614
<v Speaker 2>lasting weight loss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you look at the people who were the </v>

297
00:14:46.031 --> 00:14:48.970
<v Speaker 2>five percent who actually keep it off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

298
00:14:49.570 --> 00:14:51.160
<v Speaker 2>it's that they pick something that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>sustainable,</v>

299
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:54.380
<v Speaker 2>whether it be key to genic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it be low carb,</v>

300
00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:56.930
<v Speaker 2>high or low fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>

301
00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.380
<v Speaker 2>Vegan something that they can sustain </v>
<v Speaker 2>and make a lifestyle.</v>

302
00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:04.430
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if you look at Meta analyses for</v>

303
00:15:04.431 --> 00:15:06.310
<v Speaker 2>our listeners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>med analyses are,</v>

304
00:15:06.370 --> 00:15:07.203
<v Speaker 2>are kind of a study of studies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they take researchers take studies </v>

305
00:15:11.781 --> 00:15:12.614
<v Speaker 2>that have similar parameters and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of lumped them together and they </v>

306
00:15:15.771 --> 00:15:16.281
<v Speaker 2>look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

307
00:15:16.281 --> 00:15:18.200
<v Speaker 2>what's the consensus amongst these </v>
<v Speaker 2>studies?</v>

308
00:15:18.201 --> 00:15:20.360
<v Speaker 2>And they have advanced statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They used to run this.</v>

309
00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:22.243
<v Speaker 2>If you look at low carb versus low fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no difference in adherence </v>

310
00:15:27.111 --> 00:15:27.944
<v Speaker 2>overall on the whole there's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference and there's no difference in </v>

311
00:15:30.141 --> 00:15:33.950
<v Speaker 2>weight loss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no difference in blood lipids,</v>

312
00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:34.843
<v Speaker 2>even glycaemic control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there was a study where they met </v>

313
00:15:36.891 --> 00:15:39.260
<v Speaker 2>analysis of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was 23 studies,</v>

314
00:15:39.261 --> 00:15:41.780
<v Speaker 2>over 3000 people where they looked at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

315
00:15:41.781 --> 00:15:44.180
<v Speaker 2>if you control calories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so calories are equated,</v>

316
00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:50.380
<v Speaker 2>does low carb versus low fat make a </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference on weight loss,</v>

317
00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:52.810
<v Speaker 2>glycemic control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those sorts of things.</v>

318
00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:53.893
<v Speaker 3>The key to genic diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So by definition we have an objective </v>

319
00:15:56.721 --> 00:15:57.554
<v Speaker 3>biomarker that defines the ketogenic </v>
<v Speaker 3>diet is the only diet that actually has </v>

320
00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:01.124
<v Speaker 3>something that you can measure in your </v>
<v Speaker 3>blood that say you're on this diet and </v>

321
00:16:03.861 --> 00:16:08.630
<v Speaker 3>when your ketone levels are elevated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that confers many different benefits,</v>

322
00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.553
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that I believe can enhance adherence to </v>

323
00:16:12.981 --> 00:16:14.780
<v Speaker 3>the Diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Before we get into the woods here,</v>

324
00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.033
<v Speaker 3>I want to clarify one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the difference between someone being on </v>

325
00:16:19.641 --> 00:16:20.474
<v Speaker 3>a diet and being able to sustain it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>not being able to stand in gaining all </v>

326
00:16:22.581 --> 00:16:23.414
<v Speaker 3>that weight back.</v>

327
00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:27.000
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that a discipline issue?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

328
00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:30.510
<v Speaker 2>partly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we kind of had to start looking at,</v>

329
00:16:30.930 --> 00:16:31.860
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we,</v>

330
00:16:31.861 --> 00:16:34.290
<v Speaker 2>if we go in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me read,</v>

331
00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:35.213
<v Speaker 2>let me read circle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have to find what requires the least </v>

332
00:16:38.491 --> 00:16:40.200
<v Speaker 2>amount of discipline for somebody to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stick to.</v>

333
00:16:40.201 --> 00:16:43.140
<v Speaker 2>Because discipline is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is while some people have more,</v>

334
00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:45.690
<v Speaker 2>some people have less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

335
00:16:45.990 --> 00:16:46.823
<v Speaker 2>it is a finite resource.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when do we normally find that people </v>

336
00:16:50.581 --> 00:16:53.160
<v Speaker 2>like kind of drop off whatever they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

337
00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:55.980
<v Speaker 2>It's when they're stressed out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>

338
00:16:55.981 --> 00:16:58.530
<v Speaker 2>stressing them out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going through a divorce,</v>

339
00:16:58.650 --> 00:16:59.970
<v Speaker 2>those kinds of things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

340
00:16:59.971 --> 00:17:00.804
<v Speaker 2>That's where are our discipline kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanes because we're trying to be so </v>

341
00:17:03.871 --> 00:17:06.660
<v Speaker 2>disciplined for this other thing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's draining us.</v>

342
00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:11.990
<v Speaker 2>So what happens with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with diet is in people who are busy,</v>

343
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:14.610
<v Speaker 2>people who have a lot of stress in their</v>
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

344
00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:16.540
<v Speaker 2>that's where they really start </v>
<v Speaker 2>overeating.</v>

345
00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:20.070
<v Speaker 2>So we have to find something that I look</v>
<v Speaker 2>at it.</v>

346
00:17:20.130 --> 00:17:22.320
<v Speaker 2>Let's find something that requires the </v>
<v Speaker 2>minimal amount of,</v>

347
00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:26.280
<v Speaker 2>of discipline for a person so that when </v>
<v Speaker 2>your life goes to absolute shit,</v>

348
00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:30.810
<v Speaker 2>you can still stick to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so for some people that is a very,</v>

349
00:17:30.811 --> 00:17:31.644
<v Speaker 2>very individual thing and they see this </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the dietary studies that what works </v>

350
00:17:36.241 --> 00:17:37.074
<v Speaker 2>for one person to create a deficit and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sustainable isn't the same way for </v>

351
00:17:40.651 --> 00:17:43.320
<v Speaker 2>another person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Dom even commented on this about his</v>

352
00:17:43.321 --> 00:17:44.154
<v Speaker 2>wife Chella,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she does much better on a higher ratio </v>

353
00:17:47.671 --> 00:17:48.810
<v Speaker 2>of carbohydrates to fats.</v>

354
00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:49.891
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

355
00:17:49.891 --> 00:17:50.160
<v Speaker 3>early</v>

356
00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:50.993
<v Speaker 2>on it was obvious that she wasn't going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to change her diet at the time that we </v>

357
00:17:54.151 --> 00:17:55.980
<v Speaker 2>met like 10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most we,</v>

358
00:17:55.981 --> 00:18:00.390
<v Speaker 2>I was really getting into this and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>really felt that for me at least,</v>

359
00:18:00.391 --> 00:18:03.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but she would stop at checkers and get a</v>

360
00:18:03.001 --> 00:18:07.590
<v Speaker 2>burger with a sugary drink it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she's tremendously carbon tolerance.</v>

361
00:18:07.591 --> 00:18:12.591
<v Speaker 2>She was very skinny as a kid and she </v>
<v Speaker 2>tolerated a carbohydrate.</v>

362
00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:15.290
<v Speaker 2>She's very carbohydrate tolerance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did I say intolerant?</v>

363
00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:15.900
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

364
00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.010
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

365
00:18:17.011 --> 00:18:18.150
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

366
00:18:18.151 --> 00:18:23.151
<v Speaker 2>if the Diet low carb I feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and maybe in key to genic,</v>

367
00:18:23.341 --> 00:18:24.174
<v Speaker 2>putting it in under that umbrella works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think for up to 25 to 30 percent of </v>

368
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:30.270
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

369
00:18:30.370 --> 00:18:32.790
<v Speaker 2>especially at their carbohydrate </v>
<v Speaker 2>intolerant.</v>

370
00:18:33.210 --> 00:18:38.210
<v Speaker 2>And I believe that it does that by </v>
<v Speaker 2>virtue of elevating Ketones,</v>

371
00:18:38.791 --> 00:18:40.400
<v Speaker 2>shifting your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

372
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:42.930
<v Speaker 2>the neuropharmacology of the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

373
00:18:42.931 --> 00:18:44.370
<v Speaker 2>it works through Grelin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it works through,</v>

374
00:18:44.371 --> 00:18:45.204
<v Speaker 2>there's new science emerging right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>showing that appetite regulation is </v>

375
00:18:49.501 --> 00:18:50.334
<v Speaker 2>influenced a positively by a nutritional</v>
<v Speaker 2>ketosis in ways that were just starting </v>

376
00:18:55.531 --> 00:18:55.890
<v Speaker 2>to learn.</v>

377
00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:57.720
<v Speaker 2>Now what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can certainly feel it.</v>

378
00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:00.150
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the things about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketogenetic diet.</v>

379
00:19:00.151 --> 00:19:00.984
<v Speaker 2>When you're in that state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden you're just not hungry </v>

380
00:19:03.001 --> 00:19:06.210
<v Speaker 2>to say there's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an overwhelming need for food.</v>

381
00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:06.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

382
00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.880
<v Speaker 2>I haven't had anything to eat today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

383
00:19:08.881 --> 00:19:09.714
<v Speaker 2>when I was eating massive plates of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pasta Twenty five years ago and I went </v>

384
00:19:14.041 --> 00:19:17.760
<v Speaker 2>to this this long without food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would start getting shaky.</v>

385
00:19:17.761 --> 00:19:19.710
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have a hypoglycemic response.</v>

386
00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:20.573
<v Speaker 2>And I'm completely resilient to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that has major implications for </v>

387
00:19:23.581 --> 00:19:26.910
<v Speaker 2>military personnel being keto adapted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just for performance,</v>

388
00:19:26.911 --> 00:19:31.200
<v Speaker 2>preventing seizures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think for a cognitive function too.</v>

389
00:19:31.530 --> 00:19:33.270
<v Speaker 2>But you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

390
00:19:33.330 --> 00:19:37.170
<v Speaker 2>it's very liberating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So meal frequency is not an issue.</v>

391
00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:38.063
<v Speaker 2>So if you're in austere environments </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you have limited food </v>

392
00:19:40.111 --> 00:19:42.180
<v Speaker 2>availability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that becomes a major issue.</v>

393
00:19:42.181 --> 00:19:45.150
<v Speaker 2>And if you're working as a scientist and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

394
00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:46.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're working with animals,</v>

395
00:19:46.501 --> 00:19:48.060
<v Speaker 2>you're doing experiments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't have time to eat.</v>

396
00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:50.820
<v Speaker 2>I need to maintain that cognitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>function.</v>

397
00:19:50.821 --> 00:19:52.130
<v Speaker 2>I needed to be sharp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

398
00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:55.380
<v Speaker 2>with limited boot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it worked very good for me throughout</v>

399
00:19:55.381 --> 00:19:56.590
<v Speaker 2>my professorship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

400
00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:57.523
<v Speaker 2>getting tenure and things like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>where I could just put more time and </v>

401
00:19:59.041 --> 00:20:02.130
<v Speaker 2>energy into my work without having to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stop,</v>

402
00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:03.900
<v Speaker 2>prepare a meal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat a meal,</v>

403
00:20:03.901 --> 00:20:04.734
<v Speaker 2>clean up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I think I wasted a lot of time </v>

404
00:20:06.901 --> 00:20:09.090
<v Speaker 2>doing that when I was eating five to six</v>
<v Speaker 2>meals a day.</v>

405
00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.153
<v Speaker 2>He said something that I think you've </v>
<v Speaker 2>called bullshit on before the phrase </v>

406
00:20:14.251 --> 00:20:17.130
<v Speaker 2>carb intolerant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>

407
00:20:17.131 --> 00:20:19.110
<v Speaker 2>So that was actually going to be one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the things that could say,</v>

408
00:20:19.111 --> 00:20:20.670
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have something we can disagree about.</v>

409
00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:22.770
<v Speaker 2>Carb tolerance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>carb,</v>

410
00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:25.590
<v Speaker 2>carb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you would say how we define that?</v>

411
00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:26.430
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

412
00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:28.320
<v Speaker 2>So if you have to find it by a blood </v>
<v Speaker 2>marker,</v>

413
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:29.940
<v Speaker 2>your glucose response to a meal.</v>

414
00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:32.730
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a couple of things.</v>

415
00:20:32.830 --> 00:20:36.240
<v Speaker 2>I want to come right out and frame this </v>
<v Speaker 2>whole discussion real quick.</v>

416
00:20:36.241 --> 00:20:39.930
<v Speaker 2>So we both agree that in terms of weight</v>
<v Speaker 2>loss and body composition,</v>

417
00:20:39.931 --> 00:20:43.020
<v Speaker 2>that your total calorie intake per day </v>
<v Speaker 2>is the most important thing,</v>

418
00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:44.940
<v Speaker 2>correct?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

419
00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:49.450
<v Speaker 2>I believe the key to genic strategy is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>way to regulate that,</v>

420
00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:52.150
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So with,</v>

421
00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:53.770
<v Speaker 2>with carbon tolerance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

422
00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:57.730
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the benefits of like on </v>
<v Speaker 2>blood glucose,</v>

423
00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:58.623
<v Speaker 2>blood lipids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is almost 90 to 95 percent explained </v>

424
00:21:02.591 --> 00:21:03.424
<v Speaker 2>by weight loss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can take people put them on a </v>

425
00:21:05.711 --> 00:21:07.570
<v Speaker 2>high carb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very low fat diet,</v>

426
00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:10.660
<v Speaker 2>their blood glucose in their blood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lipids will drop,</v>

427
00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:15.940
<v Speaker 2>eat even with like higher insulin levels</v>
<v Speaker 2>than people who are in a a low carb diet</v>

428
00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:19.540
<v Speaker 2>if they're on a calorie restricted </v>
<v Speaker 2>calorie restricted.</v>

429
00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:20.463
<v Speaker 2>Now again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that becomes a very individual </v>

430
00:21:21.971 --> 00:21:22.840
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

431
00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:24.070
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if somebody says,</v>

432
00:21:24.071 --> 00:21:24.904
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like a ketogenic diet because for me </v>

433
00:21:26.231 --> 00:21:28.330
<v Speaker 2>it helps me to create a calorie deficit.</v>

434
00:21:28.330 --> 00:21:29.680
<v Speaker 2>I can stick to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

435
00:21:29.681 --> 00:21:31.690
<v Speaker 2>knock yourself out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is no problem.</v>

436
00:21:31.750 --> 00:21:32.583
<v Speaker 2>But that is not always gonna work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people don't feel that satiated on </v>

437
00:21:35.891 --> 00:21:39.070
<v Speaker 2>a ketogenic diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are people who do feel hungrier on</v>

438
00:21:39.071 --> 00:21:41.770
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that is a very individual response.</v>

439
00:21:41.771 --> 00:21:44.650
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we look at studies we're looking at</v>

440
00:21:44.651 --> 00:21:45.640
<v Speaker 2>means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

441
00:21:45.641 --> 00:21:48.850
<v Speaker 2>So we're talking about averages and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are outliers,</v>

442
00:21:48.851 --> 00:21:51.190
<v Speaker 2>like if you look at any Gaussian </v>
<v Speaker 2>distribution chart,</v>

443
00:21:51.191 --> 00:21:52.024
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of how populations </v>
<v Speaker 2>distributed based on a certain </v>

444
00:21:53.891 --> 00:21:54.724
<v Speaker 2>treatment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have about 60 to 70 percent that </v>

445
00:21:56.741 --> 00:21:58.390
<v Speaker 2>fall into the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the average.</v>

446
00:21:59.050 --> 00:22:00.870
<v Speaker 2>Then you have another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

447
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:01.783
<v Speaker 2>10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 percent that are kind of do a little </v>

448
00:22:03.191 --> 00:22:06.550
<v Speaker 2>bit better one way versus the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you have five percent on either</v>

449
00:22:06.551 --> 00:22:07.384
<v Speaker 2>end that are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

450
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:09.160
<v Speaker 2>two and a half percent on either end </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are outliers.</v>

451
00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:12.280
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So just to frame this again,</v>

452
00:22:12.281 --> 00:22:13.180
<v Speaker 2>let's take weightlifting.</v>

453
00:22:13.210 --> 00:22:15.160
<v Speaker 2>We know weightlifting makes you bigger </v>
<v Speaker 2>and stronger,</v>

454
00:22:15.310 --> 00:22:16.870
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that is not up for debate.</v>

455
00:22:16.930 --> 00:22:17.763
<v Speaker 2>We agree on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are studies that have shown that </v>

456
00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:21.093
<v Speaker 2>some people who are beginners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you should be gaining a lot of </v>

457
00:22:23.141 --> 00:22:24.530
<v Speaker 2>muscle very quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

458
00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:25.503
<v Speaker 2>some people will go from the first time </v>
<v Speaker 2>they walk into the gym Squat Ninety </v>

459
00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:28.451
<v Speaker 2>Five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>12 weeks,</v>

460
00:22:28.451 --> 00:22:29.620
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're squatting 400 pounds.</v>

461
00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:33.130
<v Speaker 2>Some people don't get stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've actually been.</v>

462
00:22:33.131 --> 00:22:33.964
<v Speaker 2>Studies were over 12 weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is a few individuals who did not </v>

463
00:22:35.861 --> 00:22:38.830
<v Speaker 2>get stronger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so those are your outliers right there.</v>

464
00:22:38.831 --> 00:22:41.320
<v Speaker 2>So if we circle this back to Ketogenic </v>
<v Speaker 2>Diet,</v>

465
00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:45.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sitting here and saying that </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody may actually physiologically do</v>

466
00:22:45.461 --> 00:22:50.320
<v Speaker 2>better on a ketogenic diet versus a a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lower fat diet.</v>

467
00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:54.700
<v Speaker 2>That's a very individual response,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when we start making recommendations</v>

468
00:22:54.701 --> 00:22:55.534
<v Speaker 2>for people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we should start with is okay </v>

469
00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:57.823
<v Speaker 2>created calorie deficit that allows you </v>
<v Speaker 2>to lose some weight because if we look </v>

470
00:23:01.181 --> 00:23:04.570
<v Speaker 2>at the studies and we look at if we </v>
<v Speaker 2>equate for protein,</v>

471
00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:05.620
<v Speaker 2>because that's a big thing.</v>

472
00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:09.610
<v Speaker 2>So if you look at some of the studies </v>
<v Speaker 2>were Volec did where he compared like,</v>

473
00:23:10.100 --> 00:23:10.933
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of food guide pyramid type </v>

474
00:23:12.911 --> 00:23:13.744
<v Speaker 2>diet to a ketogenic diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The ketogenic diets were a little bit </v>

475
00:23:16.841 --> 00:23:17.674
<v Speaker 2>higher protein.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That protein has a thermogenic effect </v>

476
00:23:19.481 --> 00:23:23.590
<v Speaker 2>and also an appetite suppression effect </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you equate for those.</v>

477
00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:24.513
<v Speaker 2>And there's been 32 studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a recent med analysis done of </v>

478
00:23:27.041 --> 00:23:29.770
<v Speaker 2>32 studies and acquainted for calories </v>
<v Speaker 2>and protein.</v>

479
00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:31.443
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely no difference in fat loss </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you equate for those two calories </v>

480
00:23:35.591 --> 00:23:36.424
<v Speaker 2>and protein because protein is a big one</v>
<v Speaker 2>because protein has a big benefit on </v>

481
00:23:39.791 --> 00:23:43.780
<v Speaker 2>thermogenesis and weight loss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also a lean body,</v>

482
00:23:43.781 --> 00:23:46.370
<v Speaker 2>mass retention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is huge because one of the reasons</v>

483
00:23:46.371 --> 00:23:48.560
<v Speaker 2>people regain weight is because when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they lose weight,</v>

484
00:23:48.561 --> 00:23:50.630
<v Speaker 2>they tend to lose fat and muscle and </v>
<v Speaker 2>when they regain it,</v>

485
00:23:50.631 --> 00:23:53.660
<v Speaker 2>it's almost all fat in the initial phase</v>
<v Speaker 2>as far as</v>

486
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:57.050
<v Speaker 3>and may not have included data with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>key to genic diet.</v>

487
00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:58.550
<v Speaker 3>So I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

488
00:23:58.551 --> 00:24:00.800
<v Speaker 3>when I did the die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've seen a lot of blood work,</v>

489
00:24:00.801 --> 00:24:02.330
<v Speaker 3>so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my hemoglobin h,</v>

490
00:24:02.331 --> 00:24:04.100
<v Speaker 3>one c,</v>
<v Speaker 3>triglycerides,</v>

491
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:06.440
<v Speaker 3>hs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crp goes down,</v>

492
00:24:06.441 --> 00:24:08.480
<v Speaker 3>insulin goes down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blood pressure goes down,</v>

493
00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.550
<v Speaker 3>and that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that all those,</v>

494
00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:14.120
<v Speaker 3>all those changes happened without my </v>
<v Speaker 3>bodyweight changing.</v>

495
00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:16.640
<v Speaker 3>So that would kind of argue against </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

496
00:24:16.641 --> 00:24:19.000
<v Speaker 3>You needed to catch us deficit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

497
00:24:19.001 --> 00:24:22.030
<v Speaker 3>and I've seen it many times,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but once you could,</v>

498
00:24:22.031 --> 00:24:22.864
<v Speaker 3>I could be eating 80 to 90 percent carbs</v>
<v Speaker 3>and reduced my body weight and get </v>

499
00:24:27.171 --> 00:24:29.930
<v Speaker 3>changes in all that I could actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>increase my carbs.</v>

500
00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:33.260
<v Speaker 3>And if I create a calorie deficit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

501
00:24:33.261 --> 00:24:34.730
<v Speaker 3>my hemoglobin h,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one c will go down,</v>

502
00:24:34.731 --> 00:24:35.960
<v Speaker 3>my sugar will go down and things like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

503
00:24:35.961 --> 00:24:40.250
<v Speaker 3>So that is really the draw that's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that trumps everything,</v>

504
00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.830
<v Speaker 3>that calorie deficit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that that's an important thing.</v>

505
00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:43.783
<v Speaker 2>So that's what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I think a lot of people </v>

506
00:24:44.721 --> 00:24:45.800
<v Speaker 2>miss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

507
00:24:45.910 --> 00:24:48.410
<v Speaker 2>I think that that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'll say is.</v>

508
00:24:48.411 --> 00:24:50.960
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying like,</v>

509
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:51.560
<v Speaker 2>I think</v>

510
00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:52.393
<v Speaker 3>it's very powerful too that these </v>
<v Speaker 3>changes that I just mentioned can occur </v>

511
00:24:55.161 --> 00:24:58.610
<v Speaker 3>without a will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>without changing your body weight.</v>

512
00:24:58.760 --> 00:24:59.750
<v Speaker 3>So they are just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

513
00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:04.100
<v Speaker 3>you're fundamentally changing your </v>
<v Speaker 3>metabolism when you do that from car.</v>

514
00:25:04.101 --> 00:25:07.070
<v Speaker 3>And that has pretty wide ranging </v>
<v Speaker 3>implications.</v>

515
00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:11.030
<v Speaker 2>So I think that what I'm going to say is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you,</v>

516
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:13.310
<v Speaker 2>if we're going to talk about people </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting healthier,</v>

517
00:25:13.910 --> 00:25:14.743
<v Speaker 2>the first thing we need to start with is</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's not lose 50 percent are going </v>

518
00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:19.760
<v Speaker 2>about five percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

519
00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:21.590
<v Speaker 2>So if I tell somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

520
00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:24.830
<v Speaker 2>find a diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can stick to that sustainable.</v>

521
00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:26.083
<v Speaker 2>And if you can lose 10 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can lose 10 percent of your body </v>

522
00:25:27.951 --> 00:25:29.060
<v Speaker 2>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even for obese people,</v>

523
00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:32.870
<v Speaker 2>they get almost all the health benefits </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the first 10 percent now.</v>

524
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:34.303
<v Speaker 2>Now maybe some people like you or people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who respond really well to a ketogenic </v>

525
00:25:37.071 --> 00:25:37.904
<v Speaker 2>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

526
00:25:37.910 --> 00:25:38.743
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's outliers or people on the other </v>

527
00:25:40.581 --> 00:25:41.414
<v Speaker 2>sides of the Gaussian curve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do a little bit better on there </v>

528
00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.553
<v Speaker 2>then great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you find a ketogenic diet is </v>

529
00:25:47.541 --> 00:25:49.850
<v Speaker 2>completely unsustainable for you and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not,</v>

530
00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:50.703
<v Speaker 2>you're not able to stick to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're trying to do it because </v>

531
00:25:52.611 --> 00:25:55.280
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to get a little bit better</v>
<v Speaker 2>blood glucose regulation.</v>

532
00:25:55.610 --> 00:25:56.620
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

533
00:25:56.850 --> 00:25:57.683
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're kind of shooting yourself in the </v>

534
00:25:58.401 --> 00:26:02.270
<v Speaker 2>foot because if you could stick to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like let's say for the individual,</v>

535
00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.580
<v Speaker 2>a higher carb diet was easier for them </v>
<v Speaker 2>to stick to.</v>

536
00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:05.653
<v Speaker 2>They could lose weight on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then that's the bulk of their health </v>

537
00:26:08.211 --> 00:26:09.044
<v Speaker 2>benefits they're going to get from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm having a hard time with these terms </v>

538
00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:15.590
<v Speaker 2>easier because I don't know exactly why </v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be easier,</v>

539
00:26:15.591 --> 00:26:18.230
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't be easier and I always wonder </v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

540
00:26:18.231 --> 00:26:21.080
<v Speaker 2>is this a discipline issue because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's your experience.</v>

541
00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:23.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes down for this,</v>

542
00:26:23.330 --> 00:26:24.070
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My</v>

543
00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:24.903
<v Speaker 3>preference,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I believe that by when you follow </v>

544
00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:31.360
<v Speaker 3>low carb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not even ketogenic diet,</v>

545
00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:35.680
<v Speaker 3>the variability of the fluctuations in </v>
<v Speaker 3>your insulin and Blood Glucose,</v>

546
00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:38.530
<v Speaker 3>the Postprandial dip in blood glucose </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you get after it,</v>

547
00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:39.633
<v Speaker 3>that's virtually abolished or </v>
<v Speaker 3>significantly attenuated and then you </v>

548
00:26:42.521 --> 00:26:44.280
<v Speaker 3>have a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

549
00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:47.250
<v Speaker 3>ketones are working through Grelin for </v>
<v Speaker 3>example.</v>

550
00:26:47.251 --> 00:26:48.084
<v Speaker 3>You could just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you could eat a normal diet and drink </v>

551
00:26:49.261 --> 00:26:52.260
<v Speaker 3>ketones and it's actually suppressing </v>
<v Speaker 3>your appetite through Grelin.</v>

552
00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:56.400
<v Speaker 3>So we know that these changes or </v>
<v Speaker 3>reductions in and you're saying,</v>

553
00:26:56.550 --> 00:26:57.383
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

554
00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:01.530
<v Speaker 3>so um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so these changes are happening,</v>

555
00:27:01.531 --> 00:27:05.880
<v Speaker 3>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my sister for example,</v>

556
00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:06.743
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>follow the Ketogenic Diet and found it </v>

557
00:27:09.241 --> 00:27:10.074
<v Speaker 3>easy to follow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But she gained weight because she was </v>

558
00:27:11.281 --> 00:27:13.260
<v Speaker 3>eating all these fat bombs that she was </v>
<v Speaker 3>making.</v>

559
00:27:13.290 --> 00:27:14.123
<v Speaker 3>So she far and a lot of people don't </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily need a nutritionist to tell </v>

560
00:27:19.441 --> 00:27:20.274
<v Speaker 3>them what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they needed like a nutritional </v>

561
00:27:21.271 --> 00:27:22.810
<v Speaker 3>psychotherapist or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

562
00:27:22.870 --> 00:27:25.860
<v Speaker 3>their,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their relationship with food is really.</v>

563
00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:28.560
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's what lane has a firm </v>
<v Speaker 3>grasp on.</v>

564
00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:29.423
<v Speaker 3>There's no substitute for experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Lane has worked with so many </v>

565
00:27:31.861 --> 00:27:34.230
<v Speaker 3>different clients and knows that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

566
00:27:34.231 --> 00:27:37.710
<v Speaker 3>you could probably follow the cue j dot </v>
<v Speaker 3>your listeners are probably fans of die.</v>

567
00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:40.290
<v Speaker 3>I can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love fatty food,</v>

568
00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:42.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a high fat food look our food.</v>

569
00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.360
<v Speaker 3>But generally speaking it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

570
00:27:45.361 --> 00:27:49.320
<v Speaker 3>you have to approach it from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective of sort of eating behavior.</v>

571
00:27:49.410 --> 00:27:52.260
<v Speaker 3>And I think that that's really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People want to go off the Diet.</v>

572
00:27:52.261 --> 00:27:53.580
<v Speaker 3>It's just a natural human trait.</v>

573
00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:55.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a weird psychological trait,</v>

574
00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:57.150
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just want to cheat.</v>

575
00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:59.940
<v Speaker 4>You want to just stuff your face with </v>
<v Speaker 4>cupcakes every now and then.</v>

576
00:27:59.941 --> 00:28:00.774
<v Speaker 4>And then you just feel like it's too </v>
<v Speaker 4>much torture to keep yourself on this </v>

577
00:28:03.301 --> 00:28:06.360
<v Speaker 4>narrow path of high fat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>low carb,</v>

578
00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:08.400
<v Speaker 4>moderate protein.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

579
00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.950
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 years ago that was the case.</v>

580
00:28:11.951 --> 00:28:15.250
<v Speaker 3>But now there is key to genic brownies </v>
<v Speaker 3>or cookies.</v>

581
00:28:15.251 --> 00:28:17.230
<v Speaker 3>There's many different food companies </v>
<v Speaker 3>like shirt</v>

582
00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:20.180
<v Speaker 4>got chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've tried,</v>

583
00:28:20.181 --> 00:28:22.840
<v Speaker 4>I tried so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Go to Quito.</v>

584
00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:24.713
<v Speaker 4>I have a real one and a kito cookie and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then fucking real fucking gets eaten </v>

585
00:28:28.301 --> 00:28:29.920
<v Speaker 4>every time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

586
00:28:29.950 --> 00:28:31.880
<v Speaker 4>well they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they are evolving.</v>

587
00:28:31.881 --> 00:28:32.200
<v Speaker 4>Just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

588
00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.410
<v Speaker 4>food technology and evolving some of </v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

589
00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:36.010
<v Speaker 4>no foods,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make some good stuff.</v>

590
00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:38.170
<v Speaker 4>Go to go to Quito,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nutrition.org.</v>

591
00:28:38.171 --> 00:28:40.580
<v Speaker 4>And there's some things there that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>would say about 10 or 20</v>

592
00:28:40.620 --> 00:28:41.453
<v Speaker 3>percent passed the test,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meaning that they taste okay and they </v>

593
00:28:44.071 --> 00:28:48.330
<v Speaker 3>actually do what they say they actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>elevate ketones or you know,</v>

594
00:28:48.331 --> 00:28:49.440
<v Speaker 3>don't call it the glycine</v>

595
00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:53.210
<v Speaker 4>on some of those Keto Kookies seem like </v>
<v Speaker 4>they have no foundation.</v>

596
00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:56.870
<v Speaker 4>Like you bite in the Galway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like as you're eating them,</v>

597
00:28:57.290 --> 00:28:58.123
<v Speaker 4>it's like they dissolve.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you have like a good toll house </v>

598
00:29:00.951 --> 00:29:01.784
<v Speaker 4>cookie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a good real chocolate chip cookie and </v>

599
00:29:03.981 --> 00:29:05.930
<v Speaker 4>you bite into that soccer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

600
00:29:05.931 --> 00:29:06.764
<v Speaker 4>it's bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But God damn it feels good while it's </v>

601
00:29:08.511 --> 00:29:10.760
<v Speaker 4>being tried.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The quest protein cookies.</v>

602
00:29:10.790 --> 00:29:11.780
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're pretty good.</v>

603
00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:12.653
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pretty good.</v>

604
00:29:13.220 --> 00:29:13.791
<v Speaker 4>Pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

605
00:29:13.791 --> 00:29:15.490
<v Speaker 4>They can't fuck with real cookies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

606
00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:17.280
<v Speaker 4>Well I dip.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I dip them in,</v>

607
00:29:17.281 --> 00:29:18.690
<v Speaker 4>in like sour cream,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

608
00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:19.643
<v Speaker 4>And then I eat them or coconut cream so </v>
<v Speaker 4>that then it becomes good to just get a </v>

609
00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.760
<v Speaker 4>commitment to a life that you bring that</v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

610
00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.150
<v Speaker 4>Interesting though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

611
00:29:31.130 --> 00:29:33.970
<v Speaker 4>if you look at people that think they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>addicted to sugar,</v>

612
00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:34.813
<v Speaker 4>that sugar is a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you look at things like cookies and </v>

613
00:29:35.961 --> 00:29:40.220
<v Speaker 4>cakes and it's actually they have more </v>
<v Speaker 4>calories from fats than they do sugars.</v>

614
00:29:40.550 --> 00:29:42.340
<v Speaker 4>It's sugar and fat together</v>

615
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:43.173
<v Speaker 2>is hyper palatable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But so we know one of the things I was </v>

616
00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:47.720
<v Speaker 2>going to bring up as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

617
00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:48.843
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this idea that the sugar is so </v>

618
00:29:50.621 --> 00:29:52.540
<v Speaker 2>inherently bad and you said that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cookie,</v>

619
00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:54.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we view that as an inherently bad thing.</v>

620
00:29:55.210 --> 00:29:57.130
<v Speaker 2>But what if I told you that a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

621
00:29:57.250 --> 00:29:59.080
<v Speaker 2>not everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's different,</v>

622
00:29:59.110 --> 00:30:01.270
<v Speaker 2>but there are certain people who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you tell them,</v>

623
00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:02.980
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have that cookie every once in a</v>

624
00:30:02.981 --> 00:30:05.620
<v Speaker 2>while if you track it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>work it into your macronutrient intake,</v>

625
00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:06.800
<v Speaker 2>that that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

626
00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:08.530
<v Speaker 2>that actually improve their adherence to</v>
<v Speaker 2>diet.</v>

627
00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:12.430
<v Speaker 2>So because you give them a reward,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

628
00:30:12.570 --> 00:30:13.990
<v Speaker 2>not a reward system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not a dog,</v>

629
00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:18.400
<v Speaker 2>don't reward yourself with food because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because increased flexibility,</v>

630
00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:20.800
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually usually improves adherence.</v>

631
00:30:21.250 --> 00:30:22.083
<v Speaker 2>So we see this actually with training to</v>
<v Speaker 2>a athletes are when you do a flexible </v>

632
00:30:25.781 --> 00:30:28.600
<v Speaker 2>training model where they have to get in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a certain amount of training,</v>

633
00:30:28.601 --> 00:30:30.690
<v Speaker 2>but they kind of can pick and choose </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>

634
00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:33.790
<v Speaker 2>which days are hard and which days are a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit they actually do better.</v>

635
00:30:34.330 --> 00:30:35.163
<v Speaker 2>Diet is very similar to that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now you always have to sacrifice </v>

636
00:30:39.161 --> 00:30:41.600
<v Speaker 2>something in order to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

637
00:30:41.650 --> 00:30:42.850
<v Speaker 2>if you want to lose weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

638
00:30:42.851 --> 00:30:45.490
<v Speaker 2>So if you're doing a ketogenic diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you're sacrificing is saying,</v>

639
00:30:45.491 --> 00:30:48.280
<v Speaker 2>well I like the spontaneous reductions </v>
<v Speaker 2>in appetite,</v>

640
00:30:48.281 --> 00:30:49.114
<v Speaker 2>so I don't mind eating these foods so I </v>
<v Speaker 2>can get that if you're doing like kind </v>

641
00:30:54.281 --> 00:30:56.110
<v Speaker 2>of what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to say I popularized it,</v>

642
00:30:56.111 --> 00:30:56.944
<v Speaker 2>but myself and some other people on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>message boards popularized something </v>

643
00:30:58.601 --> 00:30:59.434
<v Speaker 2>called flexible dieting where you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>eat essentially whatever you want as </v>

644
00:31:03.401 --> 00:31:05.950
<v Speaker 2>long as you hit your protein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrate and fat targets.</v>

645
00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:09.100
<v Speaker 2>Now what you're sacrificing is okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're tracking every day.</v>

646
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:11.220
<v Speaker 2>Do you do that through an APP?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Through what?</v>

647
00:31:11.290 --> 00:31:12.290
<v Speaker 2>An APP?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

648
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:13.180
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm old school.</v>

649
00:31:13.181 --> 00:31:17.260
<v Speaker 2>I actually just do it through excel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've my girlfriend holly,</v>

650
00:31:17.261 --> 00:31:22.261
<v Speaker 2>she has an app on her phone and she,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she has me like if she's driving,</v>

651
00:31:22.290 --> 00:31:23.470
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh well you put in what I just ate.</v>

652
00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:24.161
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Babe,</v>

653
00:31:24.161 --> 00:31:27.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea how to work this thing.</v>

654
00:31:27.311 --> 00:31:31.810
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So because when I went to do my graduate</v>

655
00:31:31.811 --> 00:31:34.180
<v Speaker 2>studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I wanted to find magic foods.</v>

656
00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:36.370
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to find something that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>

657
00:31:36.910 --> 00:31:39.790
<v Speaker 2>how else can you make a living?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to set yourself apart.</v>

658
00:31:39.791 --> 00:31:42.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean if I'm over here saying it's hard</v>
<v Speaker 2>for me to sell what I,</v>

659
00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:44.890
<v Speaker 2>what I do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I'm saying,</v>

660
00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:45.753
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything in moderation and you got to </v>

661
00:31:47.411 --> 00:31:48.244
<v Speaker 2>be diligent and you got to have these </v>
<v Speaker 2>behaviors and that doesn't sound sexy </v>

662
00:31:50.381 --> 00:31:52.030
<v Speaker 2>when there's another guy over here </v>
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>

663
00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:53.770
<v Speaker 2>now bro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just carbs.</v>

664
00:31:53.771 --> 00:31:55.780
<v Speaker 2>I know what tablet isms complicated and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

665
00:31:55.781 --> 00:31:58.190
<v Speaker 2>but it's just carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

666
00:31:58.810 --> 00:31:59.643
<v Speaker 2>when I started working with people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I've worked with over 1500 people </v>

667
00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:04.930
<v Speaker 2>coaching and nutrition online over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>past 13 years,</v>

668
00:32:04.931 --> 00:32:06.600
<v Speaker 2>which actually probably taught me more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than my,</v>

669
00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:09.140
<v Speaker 2>my phd did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

670
00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:10.593
<v Speaker 2>what I found was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that people were so different </v>

671
00:32:12.731 --> 00:32:15.430
<v Speaker 2>individually in terms of what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what made them tick,</v>

672
00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:16.593
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I feel like I should probably go </v>

673
00:32:18.041 --> 00:32:18.874
<v Speaker 2>back and get some kind of interesting to</v>
<v Speaker 2>biologically what makes them tick or a </v>

674
00:32:21.401 --> 00:32:22.930
<v Speaker 2>psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both,</v>

675
00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:23.853
<v Speaker 2>both,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I can't sit here and say by the </v>

676
00:32:25.931 --> 00:32:30.931
<v Speaker 2>research that that carbohydrate versus </v>
<v Speaker 2>fat makes a difference on fat loss.</v>

677
00:32:32.050 --> 00:32:32.883
<v Speaker 2>But what I can tell you is that some </v>
<v Speaker 2>people just seem to do better on lower </v>

678
00:32:36.641 --> 00:32:37.780
<v Speaker 2>carb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>higher fat.</v>

679
00:32:37.990 --> 00:32:39.980
<v Speaker 2>But also some people I with just seem to</v>

680
00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:42.050
<v Speaker 4>do better with higher carb,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lower fat.</v>

681
00:32:42.290 --> 00:32:43.123
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether that's a psychological thing or </v>

682
00:32:44.271 --> 00:32:46.940
<v Speaker 4>a physiological thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to tease out medically to.</v>

683
00:32:46.941 --> 00:32:49.580
<v Speaker 4>I think we all have different snips,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

684
00:32:49.610 --> 00:32:50.443
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

685
00:32:50.450 --> 00:32:53.480
<v Speaker 4>some people have suppressed fatty acid </v>
<v Speaker 4>oxidation pathways,</v>

686
00:32:53.481 --> 00:32:56.060
<v Speaker 4>other are like screaming fast </v>
<v Speaker 4>metabolizers,</v>

687
00:32:56.061 --> 00:32:58.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or fat or sugar metabolizers.</v>

688
00:32:58.610 --> 00:32:59.720
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

689
00:32:59.721 --> 00:33:00.554
<v Speaker 4>but if you look at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I remember I had a conversation </v>

690
00:33:03.381 --> 00:33:04.214
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

691
00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:05.093
<v Speaker 4>with the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the researcher Dr Nakamura at Illinois </v>

692
00:33:07.851 --> 00:33:12.050
<v Speaker 4>who was doing some of that fructose </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff when I was,</v>

693
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:13.820
<v Speaker 4>when I was a first year Grad student.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>

694
00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:14.791
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's this,</v>

695
00:33:14.791 --> 00:33:17.150
<v Speaker 4>this high fructose corn syrup,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what's causing obesity.</v>

696
00:33:17.151 --> 00:33:18.740
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he's like,</v>

697
00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:21.230
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's easy to over consume.</v>

698
00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:22.153
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you take a soda and you drink </v>

699
00:33:24.141 --> 00:33:25.760
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not less hungry than you were.</v>

700
00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:26.990
<v Speaker 4>Stopped,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very satiating.</v>

701
00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:28.333
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you're,</v>

702
00:33:28.340 --> 00:33:29.173
<v Speaker 4>if you're controlling your calories,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't seem to be more lysogenic </v>

703
00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:33.290
<v Speaker 4>than comparable carbohydrate.</v>

704
00:33:33.490 --> 00:33:34.720
<v Speaker 4>And I remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

705
00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:35.693
<v Speaker 4>that can't be right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All these people say that high fructose </v>

706
00:33:37.671 --> 00:33:39.290
<v Speaker 4>corn syrup,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was like the worst thing in the world</v>

707
00:33:39.291 --> 00:33:41.030
<v Speaker 4>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was,</v>

708
00:33:41.060 --> 00:33:44.390
<v Speaker 4>there was a few studies that really </v>
<v Speaker 4>changed my opinion on sugar.</v>

709
00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:48.620
<v Speaker 4>Now the listeners are going to hear this</v>
<v Speaker 4>and think that I'm advocating for sugar.</v>

710
00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.513
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not talking about in the context of a </v>

711
00:33:50.991 --> 00:33:55.991
<v Speaker 4>calorie surplus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a surplus than the ovary can,</v>

712
00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:58.550
<v Speaker 4>which kind of explains the state of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>United States,</v>

713
00:33:58.551 --> 00:33:59.384
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

714
00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:02.360
<v Speaker 4>partly partly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you look at sugar intake,</v>

715
00:34:02.890 --> 00:34:03.723
<v Speaker 4>there's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this Kinda gets back to the </v>

716
00:34:04.461 --> 00:34:06.230
<v Speaker 4>carbohydrate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>insulin obesity model.</v>

717
00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:07.273
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you look at sugar intake over the </v>

718
00:34:08.331 --> 00:34:09.950
<v Speaker 4>last 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>100 years,</v>

719
00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:11.113
<v Speaker 4>it went up very steadily with obesity </v>
<v Speaker 4>until around the mid nineties and then </v>

720
00:34:14.931 --> 00:34:17.690
<v Speaker 4>it took a sharp dip while obesity </v>
<v Speaker 4>continued to climb.</v>

721
00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:19.970
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just correlation data.</v>

722
00:34:20.390 --> 00:34:24.590
<v Speaker 4>But if you do look at the overall </v>
<v Speaker 4>calorie intake versus obesity rates,</v>

723
00:34:24.591 --> 00:34:27.200
<v Speaker 4>it's like an r squared of like point </v>
<v Speaker 4>nine four,</v>

724
00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:28.093
<v Speaker 4>which is really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he really sugar include high fructose </v>

725
00:34:30.291 --> 00:34:31.820
<v Speaker 4>corn syrup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that lumped into.</v>

726
00:34:31.821 --> 00:34:34.060
<v Speaker 4>So this was added sugars,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this was added sugars,</v>

727
00:34:34.190 --> 00:34:38.870
<v Speaker 4>but there was a study done by a </v>
<v Speaker 4>metabolic ward studies.</v>

728
00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:40.010
<v Speaker 4>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna stop you there.</v>

729
00:34:40.580 --> 00:34:42.850
<v Speaker 4>Are you saying that this is added </v>
<v Speaker 4>sugars,</v>

730
00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:43.933
<v Speaker 4>not high fructose fructose corn syrup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you talk about the graph of </v>

731
00:34:46.431 --> 00:34:49.460
<v Speaker 4>consumption,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that sugar dropped off,</v>

732
00:34:49.461 --> 00:34:51.520
<v Speaker 4>but high fructose corn syrup did not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that our,</v>

733
00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:54.350
<v Speaker 4>because that took over many of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>products.</v>

734
00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:58.850
<v Speaker 4>So it's an increase in obesity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a decrease in sugar consumption.</v>

735
00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:02.120
<v Speaker 4>But you're not saying a decrease in high</v>
<v Speaker 4>fructose corn syrup consumption.</v>

736
00:35:02.121 --> 00:35:04.370
<v Speaker 4>So I don't know that I'd have to look </v>
<v Speaker 4>that up.</v>

737
00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:05.420
<v Speaker 4>So here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's,</v>

738
00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:07.940
<v Speaker 4>here's me being a scientist in saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>the three magic words,</v>

739
00:35:07.941 --> 00:35:08.774
<v Speaker 4>I don't know that one of the last </v>
<v Speaker 4>conferences I went to showed that like </v>

740
00:35:11.751 --> 00:35:15.340
<v Speaker 4>the rise over the last 10 to 15 years </v>
<v Speaker 4>like skyrocketing,</v>

741
00:35:15.350 --> 00:35:18.050
<v Speaker 4>like high fructose corn syrup and sugar </v>
<v Speaker 4>was taken out.</v>

742
00:35:18.051 --> 00:35:21.910
<v Speaker 4>High Fructose Corn Syrup is subsidized </v>
<v Speaker 4>but farmers a lot cheaper and more.</v>

743
00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:24.980
<v Speaker 4>Would you agree that it's essentially </v>
<v Speaker 4>your body way?</v>

744
00:35:25.330 --> 00:35:29.290
<v Speaker 4>Processes is essentially the same sugar </v>
<v Speaker 4>versus high fructose corn syrup cows the</v>

745
00:35:29.300 --> 00:35:30.200
<v Speaker 4>calorie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

746
00:35:30.470 --> 00:35:34.460
<v Speaker 4>so sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sucrose is 50 percent glucose.</v>

747
00:35:34.461 --> 00:35:35.294
<v Speaker 4>Fifty percent fructose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>high fructose corn syrup is 55 percent </v>

748
00:35:37.621 --> 00:35:38.190
<v Speaker 4>fructose,</v>

749
00:35:38.190 --> 00:35:39.023
<v Speaker 2>45 percent glucose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're saying that that five </v>

750
00:35:41.581 --> 00:35:44.400
<v Speaker 2>percent is what's creating obesity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eh?</v>

751
00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:46.680
<v Speaker 2>Now again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychologically,</v>

752
00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:49.170
<v Speaker 2>some people just down sodas like it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>their job,</v>

753
00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.550
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you're doing that,</v>

754
00:35:50.551 --> 00:35:52.500
<v Speaker 2>especially as children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a big,</v>

755
00:35:52.501 --> 00:35:53.334
<v Speaker 2>big no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

756
00:35:53.350 --> 00:35:54.183
<v Speaker 2>he kissed the Mexican kind with the cane</v>
<v Speaker 2>sugar kids now with high with </v>

757
00:35:57.690 --> 00:36:00.840
<v Speaker 2>nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that did not exist.</v>

758
00:36:00.841 --> 00:36:04.650
<v Speaker 2>But I would say that we've got a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>kid like kids from corn syrup.</v>

759
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:05.543
<v Speaker 2>I think it's due to an excess surplus </v>
<v Speaker 2>calories and those surplus calories </v>

760
00:36:10.711 --> 00:36:12.690
<v Speaker 2>being high fructose corn syrup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're,</v>

761
00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:14.960
<v Speaker 2>if you're used to eating a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of calories and you may,</v>

762
00:36:14.961 --> 00:36:17.590
<v Speaker 2>and we back when we were actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>maintaining your weight back in the,</v>

763
00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:18.473
<v Speaker 2>before the sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were reading about 2100 calories a </v>

764
00:36:20.161 --> 00:36:21.540
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the average.</v>

765
00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.880
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now it's like 2,800</v>

766
00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:25.580
<v Speaker 2>is the average consumption.</v>

767
00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:27.650
<v Speaker 2>The United States amongst adults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

768
00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:29.800
<v Speaker 2>I think I eat a lot more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

769
00:36:29.830 --> 00:36:32.700
<v Speaker 2>but you trained but you train and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a higher lean body mass.</v>

770
00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:33.893
<v Speaker 2>So that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

771
00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.190
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now some people,</v>

772
00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:35.700
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

773
00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:37.450
<v Speaker 2>that's a whole other rabbit hole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

774
00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:39.990
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

775
00:36:40.620 --> 00:36:43.650
<v Speaker 2>if you start adding sodas in which </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't satiating at all,</v>

776
00:36:43.651 --> 00:36:45.960
<v Speaker 2>they don't positively affect your hunger</v>
<v Speaker 2>hormones.</v>

777
00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:47.143
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you continue your same normal food </v>

778
00:36:49.291 --> 00:36:50.370
<v Speaker 2>intake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom.</v>

779
00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:51.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can start to store,</v>

780
00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:52.620
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

781
00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:54.510
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can't tell somebody,</v>

782
00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:55.613
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way you can lose weight and </v>

783
00:36:56.311 --> 00:36:58.800
<v Speaker 2>drink a soda because that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

784
00:36:59.130 --> 00:36:59.963
<v Speaker 2>there was a study done by a servlet and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they looked at high-glycemic a diet </v>

785
00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:07.080
<v Speaker 2>versus low glycemic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I mean extreme.</v>

786
00:37:07.260 --> 00:37:08.093
<v Speaker 2>They did a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one group had over 100 grams of sugar a </v>

787
00:37:10.141 --> 00:37:13.710
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another group had a 10 grams or less per</v>

788
00:37:13.711 --> 00:37:17.610
<v Speaker 2>day are sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was 11 grams or less per day and they</v>

789
00:37:17.611 --> 00:37:19.140
<v Speaker 2>looked at the differences in weight </v>
<v Speaker 2>loss,</v>

790
00:37:19.230 --> 00:37:20.700
<v Speaker 2>blood lipids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that kind of stuff.</v>

791
00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:22.603
<v Speaker 2>Did that everyday for carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the group that ate 10 grams of sugar </v>

792
00:37:25.981 --> 00:37:29.460
<v Speaker 2>or less a day to day eat the same amount</v>
<v Speaker 2>of total carbohydrates,</v>

793
00:37:29.490 --> 00:37:30.730
<v Speaker 2>same amount of total carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

794
00:37:30.731 --> 00:37:31.564
<v Speaker 2>So low-glycemic versus high-glycemic </v>
<v Speaker 2>processed carbs can spike your glucose </v>

795
00:37:34.561 --> 00:37:35.910
<v Speaker 2>more than sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

796
00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:38.220
<v Speaker 2>So they did have a fire at higher fiber </v>
<v Speaker 2>intake.</v>

797
00:37:38.370 --> 00:37:40.020
<v Speaker 2>But what the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

798
00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:43.110
<v Speaker 2>they did find that they had a higher </v>
<v Speaker 2>insulin responses to the meal.</v>

799
00:37:43.111 --> 00:37:45.870
<v Speaker 2>The high sugar group did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but no differences in weight loss.</v>

800
00:37:46.290 --> 00:37:47.010
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both,</v>

801
00:37:47.010 --> 00:37:48.840
<v Speaker 2>both groups lost weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

802
00:37:48.990 --> 00:37:50.810
<v Speaker 2>the only real difference was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

803
00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:54.180
<v Speaker 2>the lower glycemic group had a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit better.</v>

804
00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:56.400
<v Speaker 2>Both groups improved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>improved cholesterol.</v>

805
00:37:56.730 --> 00:37:57.563
<v Speaker 2>The lower glycemic group had just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit better improvement probably </v>

806
00:38:00.931 --> 00:38:01.764
<v Speaker 2>because they were eating higher fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which can bind cholesterol and you </v>

807
00:38:03.781 --> 00:38:04.614
<v Speaker 2>excrete it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like to see what happened if </v>

808
00:38:05.161 --> 00:38:05.994
<v Speaker 2>they equated.</v>

809
00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:08.080
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

810
00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:11.670
<v Speaker 2>it's creating that calorie deficit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both groups lost weight.</v>

811
00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:12.533
<v Speaker 2>Now is it more difficult to create a </v>
<v Speaker 2>calorie deficit if you're eating a lot </v>

812
00:38:16.891 --> 00:38:18.480
<v Speaker 2>of sugar?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

813
00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:19.523
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I always tell people your diet is </v>

814
00:38:21.721 --> 00:38:24.660
<v Speaker 2>like a budget if you're practicing </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like flexible dieting.</v>

815
00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:25.733
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if I've got somebody like myself who </v>

816
00:38:27.841 --> 00:38:28.674
<v Speaker 2>has above average muscle mass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully I can say that people on the </v>

817
00:38:31.201 --> 00:38:35.720
<v Speaker 2>Internet probably going to do is wear a </v>
<v Speaker 2>shirt with his name on it.</v>

818
00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.460
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

819
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:40.660
<v Speaker 2>I'll say it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have above average muscle mass.</v>

820
00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:41.770
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're welcome.</v>

821
00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:42.653
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you have above average last </v>

822
00:38:44.891 --> 00:38:46.090
<v Speaker 2>semester,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you train hard,</v>

823
00:38:46.150 --> 00:38:46.983
<v Speaker 2>you have a faster metabolism naturally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've seen people who could </v>

824
00:38:48.941 --> 00:38:50.650
<v Speaker 2>maintain their body weight on six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>7,000</v>

825
00:38:50.651 --> 00:38:53.830
<v Speaker 2>calories a day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have a higher metabolic rate,</v>

826
00:38:54.010 --> 00:38:57.190
<v Speaker 2>you have a really big budget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you make $100,000,000</v>

827
00:38:57.191 --> 00:38:58.024
<v Speaker 2>a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it a big deal for you to go out and </v>

828
00:38:58.841 --> 00:38:59.674
<v Speaker 2>buy a $500,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>sports car if you can still pay your </v>

829
00:39:01.691 --> 00:39:04.120
<v Speaker 2>mortgage and pay all the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>requirements that you have?</v>

830
00:39:04.390 --> 00:39:05.290
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's fine.</v>

831
00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:09.660
<v Speaker 2>But if you make 80 grand a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should you go out and buy a $500,000</v>

832
00:39:09.661 --> 00:39:11.320
<v Speaker 2>sports car?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably not.</v>

833
00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:12.213
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you make 30 you should be on </v>

834
00:39:13.730 --> 00:39:14.600
<v Speaker 2>Nikita.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Done.</v>

835
00:39:17.340 --> 00:39:19.000
<v Speaker 2>Well you'd have increased for </v>
<v Speaker 2>deficiency.</v>

836
00:39:19.001 --> 00:39:23.190
<v Speaker 2>So it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like people up.</v>

837
00:39:23.230 --> 00:39:24.063
<v Speaker 2>So pop tarts somehow became the model of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the flexible dieting movement because </v>

838
00:39:27.131 --> 00:39:27.964
<v Speaker 2>people were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's why it's Kinda like </v>

839
00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:33.220
<v Speaker 2>counterculture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So pop tart zealots out there.</v>

840
00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:34.540
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so whenever you have.</v>

841
00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:37.120
<v Speaker 2>So clean eating became a thing amongst </v>
<v Speaker 2>bodybuilding's,</v>

842
00:39:37.210 --> 00:39:40.050
<v Speaker 2>we say eat clean even though there's no </v>
<v Speaker 2>objective,</v>

843
00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:43.410
<v Speaker 2>there's no objective definition of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

844
00:39:43.510 --> 00:39:44.890
<v Speaker 2>so people were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

845
00:39:44.891 --> 00:39:47.050
<v Speaker 2>well I'm getting shredded night pop tart</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyday.</v>

846
00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:50.710
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of your followers do that.</v>

847
00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:54.640
<v Speaker 2>They do now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I don't even like pop tarts.</v>

848
00:39:54.641 --> 00:39:56.260
<v Speaker 2>He'd be honest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you start this?</v>

849
00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:56.741
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

850
00:39:56.741 --> 00:39:57.870
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

851
00:39:57.910 --> 00:39:59.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hang on,</v>

852
00:39:59.711 --> 00:40:00.544
<v Speaker 2>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me put the context of this so it's </v>

853
00:40:02.261 --> 00:40:04.000
<v Speaker 2>more about people saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

854
00:40:04.001 --> 00:40:07.820
<v Speaker 2>I can still eat these foods I enjoy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still losing weight because I'm with</v>

855
00:40:07.821 --> 00:40:07.960
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

856
00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:10.000
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a calorie deficit and I'm hitting</v>
<v Speaker 2>my protein,</v>

857
00:40:10.001 --> 00:40:10.834
<v Speaker 2>carb and fat targets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're somebody with a slow </v>

858
00:40:13.211 --> 00:40:16.990
<v Speaker 2>metabolism and you're not exercising </v>
<v Speaker 2>very much and maybe all you're eating is</v>

859
00:40:16.991 --> 00:40:20.740
<v Speaker 2>100 grams of carbs a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should you spend 75 grams of those carbs</v>

860
00:40:20.741 --> 00:40:22.750
<v Speaker 2>on two pop tarts?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hell No.</v>

861
00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:23.673
<v Speaker 2>That's a terrible idea because you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>not going to be able to hit your other </v>

862
00:40:25.901 --> 00:40:27.640
<v Speaker 2>micronutrients and those sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

863
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:30.460
<v Speaker 2>but if you're eating 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>calories,</v>

864
00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:34.180
<v Speaker 2>like an Alberto Nunez friend of ours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're eating 4,000</v>

865
00:40:34.181 --> 00:40:35.830
<v Speaker 2>calories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>date and losing weight,</v>

866
00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:38.260
<v Speaker 2>is it a big deal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he has to pop tarts?</v>

867
00:40:38.560 --> 00:40:42.250
<v Speaker 2>Not really because he actually had one </v>
<v Speaker 2>competitor.</v>

868
00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:43.383
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a competitor who had such a fast </v>

869
00:40:44.831 --> 00:40:49.831
<v Speaker 2>metabolism that he was actually having a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of gi dysfunction because he,</v>

870
00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:51.340
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

871
00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:52.173
<v Speaker 2>he was eating like 700 grams of carbs in</v>
<v Speaker 2>200 grams of fat per day just to </v>

872
00:40:54.551 --> 00:40:56.650
<v Speaker 2>maintain his weight and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

873
00:40:56.651 --> 00:40:58.780
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel bloated all the time.</v>

874
00:40:58.930 --> 00:40:59.470
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

875
00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:01.030
<v Speaker 2>what are you eating?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what are your foods?</v>

876
00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:02.530
<v Speaker 2>And it was chicken,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rice and Broccoli,</v>

877
00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:04.960
<v Speaker 2>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a peanut butter for fats.</v>

878
00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:05.741
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

879
00:41:05.741 --> 00:41:08.290
<v Speaker 2>no wonder dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're having 150 grams of fiber a day.</v>

880
00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:09.133
<v Speaker 2>You're literally full of Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like your shit is like literally backed </v>

881
00:41:11.591 --> 00:41:13.000
<v Speaker 2>up to your esophagus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

882
00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:14.950
<v Speaker 2>So I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do me a favor,</v>

883
00:41:14.970 --> 00:41:16.930
<v Speaker 2>eats and pizza,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat some pop tarts,</v>

884
00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:21.160
<v Speaker 2>eat some more calorically dense foods </v>
<v Speaker 2>and see how you felt for three days.</v>

885
00:41:21.850 --> 00:41:23.020
<v Speaker 2>He emailed me after three days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was like,</v>

886
00:41:23.050 --> 00:41:24.550
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel so much better.</v>

887
00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:25.773
<v Speaker 2>I dropped like three pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel amazing because he doesn't make </v>

888
00:41:28.061 --> 00:41:31.630
<v Speaker 2>any sense because he got fired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The pop tart generation.</v>

889
00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:34.130
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he also inspired and I watched this play</v>

890
00:41:34.130 --> 00:41:36.080
<v Speaker 3>out online and she sounded really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

891
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:37.303
<v Speaker 3>lane actually inspired a generation of </v>
<v Speaker 3>drug free bodybuilders to go and do </v>

892
00:41:43.191 --> 00:41:44.690
<v Speaker 3>their phds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

893
00:41:44.691 --> 00:41:47.420
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually one's in my lab right now,</v>

894
00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:49.770
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>student Andrew for a little while.</v>

895
00:41:49.970 --> 00:41:52.730
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>amazing student and I think he,</v>

896
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:56.420
<v Speaker 3>he learned a lot just from watching lane</v>
<v Speaker 3>or so,</v>

897
00:41:56.421 --> 00:41:57.620
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think,</v>

898
00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:58.833
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it was amazing to see these guys </v>

899
00:42:00.861 --> 00:42:01.694
<v Speaker 3>eating that amount of pop tarts and junk</v>
<v Speaker 3>foods and Bob and I learned a lot from </v>

900
00:42:04.371 --> 00:42:06.170
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think they could do it with,</v>

901
00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:07.580
<v Speaker 3>with better carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

902
00:42:07.710 --> 00:42:12.350
<v Speaker 3>So what works for performance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what works for bodybuilding may not be,</v>

903
00:42:12.351 --> 00:42:15.500
<v Speaker 3>is probably not optimal for longevity </v>
<v Speaker 3>and health.</v>

904
00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:18.110
<v Speaker 3>So that's an important point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

905
00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:19.720
<v Speaker 3>lean winds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

906
00:42:20.030 --> 00:42:22.520
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the audio is okay.</v>

907
00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:27.350
<v Speaker 3>So I know where he's coming from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

908
00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:28.670
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to hear his opinion.</v>

909
00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:31.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So before you do that,</v>

910
00:42:31.310 --> 00:42:33.470
<v Speaker 3>why do you think that it would be an </v>
<v Speaker 3>issue?</v>

911
00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:37.850
<v Speaker 3>What would be the issue with sugar and </v>
<v Speaker 3>with pop tarts and junk food?</v>

912
00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:40.780
<v Speaker 3>What will be the negative effects?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Biologic?</v>

913
00:42:40.781 --> 00:42:41.614
<v Speaker 3>I think the accumulation of the Post </v>
<v Speaker 3>Prandial spikes in glucose and insulin </v>

914
00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:47.173
<v Speaker 3>over time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in the context of a calorie </v>

915
00:42:49.641 --> 00:42:51.680
<v Speaker 3>surplus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could be a bad thing.</v>

916
00:42:51.710 --> 00:42:54.110
<v Speaker 3>If you are doing a calorie surplus to </v>
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>

917
00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:57.110
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to gain weight and mass over time,</v>

918
00:42:57.140 --> 00:43:00.640
<v Speaker 3>which bodybuilders do following contest </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the off season,</v>

919
00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:01.923
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's even more important almost </v>

920
00:43:04.131 --> 00:43:04.964
<v Speaker 3>to actually stick with foods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrate sources that are lower </v>

921
00:43:10.401 --> 00:43:11.430
<v Speaker 3>glycemic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

922
00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:12.283
<v Speaker 3>you can only tolerate so much fiber.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think if you are running a </v>

923
00:43:14.931 --> 00:43:18.740
<v Speaker 3>calories or if you are doing a ketogenic</v>
<v Speaker 3>diet and you have a calorie surplus,</v>

924
00:43:18.770 --> 00:43:20.610
<v Speaker 3>that could be a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your triglycerides,</v>

925
00:43:20.611 --> 00:43:21.710
<v Speaker 3>your triglycerides will go up.</v>

926
00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:22.783
<v Speaker 3>So you are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're putting too much fat in the </v>

927
00:43:23.841 --> 00:43:26.480
<v Speaker 3>system and that what it would go up on a</v>
<v Speaker 3>higher carb diet,</v>

928
00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:29.360
<v Speaker 3>higher carb diet too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

929
00:43:29.361 --> 00:43:32.450
<v Speaker 3>I mean I kind of would stay along the </v>
<v Speaker 3>lines of maybe protein,</v>

930
00:43:32.451 --> 00:43:34.160
<v Speaker 3>but you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you titrate it in,</v>

931
00:43:34.210 --> 00:43:38.630
<v Speaker 3>in a reasonable amount.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I just think that the negative,</v>

932
00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:40.033
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that could come out of that is that </v>

933
00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.260
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

934
00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:45.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm following a blood glucose curve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

935
00:43:45.951 --> 00:43:47.270
<v Speaker 3>And insulin curve,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

936
00:43:47.271 --> 00:43:49.520
<v Speaker 3>and I see this very dramatically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

937
00:43:49.690 --> 00:43:52.210
<v Speaker 3>my student who is a type one diabetic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Andrew [inaudible],</v>

938
00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:53.453
<v Speaker 3>who's in and he wears a Dexcom </v>
<v Speaker 3>continuous blood glucose monitoring </v>

939
00:43:56.631 --> 00:43:57.464
<v Speaker 3>system and his insulin requirements </v>
<v Speaker 3>dramatically dropped with low carb and </v>

940
00:44:02.331 --> 00:44:05.990
<v Speaker 3>his glucose fluctuations dramatically </v>
<v Speaker 3>improved.</v>

941
00:44:05.991 --> 00:44:10.550
<v Speaker 3>And that's going to pay big dividends </v>
<v Speaker 3>probably if you have type one diabetes,</v>

942
00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:11.570
<v Speaker 3>you ever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

943
00:44:11.570 --> 00:44:13.300
<v Speaker 3>the 10 top things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

944
00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:14.960
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on how humans die,</v>

945
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:17.540
<v Speaker 3>you have a greater risk for every one of</v>
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

946
00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:18.643
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dramatic cuts 10 years off your life if </v>

947
00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:25.340
<v Speaker 3>the tighter you can keep your glucose </v>
<v Speaker 3>levels,</v>

948
00:44:25.341 --> 00:44:26.174
<v Speaker 3>your blood glucose and your insulin </v>
<v Speaker 3>levels that in the long run I feel it's </v>

949
00:44:28.671 --> 00:44:29.220
<v Speaker 3>going to pay.</v>

950
00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:31.620
<v Speaker 3>Big Science still has to show that</v>

951
00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:34.590
<v Speaker 2>I think it's not totally clear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

952
00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:38.640
<v Speaker 2>but I think we can for type one </v>
<v Speaker 2>diabetics,</v>

953
00:44:38.641 --> 00:44:40.680
<v Speaker 2>which I think we can apply that data to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

954
00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:43.290
<v Speaker 2>to the population if they control their </v>
<v Speaker 2>glucose levels,</v>

955
00:44:43.410 --> 00:44:46.560
<v Speaker 2>that pays big dividends in the long run </v>
<v Speaker 2>lane.</v>

956
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:49.420
<v Speaker 2>So a couple things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

957
00:44:49.430 --> 00:44:51.270
<v Speaker 2>You touched on a couple of points I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to bring up,</v>

958
00:44:51.300 --> 00:44:54.470
<v Speaker 2>but I want to address one thing first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a,</v>

959
00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:58.080
<v Speaker 2>the higher post Prandial insulin in </v>
<v Speaker 2>those negative effects on health.</v>

960
00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:00.570
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you have,</v>

961
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:03.030
<v Speaker 2>they've done studies on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on BMI versus insulin.</v>

962
00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:06.270
<v Speaker 2>Now Bmi as a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can debate about how useful a measure</v>

963
00:45:06.271 --> 00:45:07.104
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in general it reflects body fat in </v>

964
00:45:08.371 --> 00:45:10.310
<v Speaker 2>the average population,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not lifters,</v>

965
00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:12.780
<v Speaker 2>but in the average BMI,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

966
00:45:12.781 --> 00:45:13.614
<v Speaker 2>for people who are listening is a ratio </v>
<v Speaker 2>of your height versus your weight that </v>

967
00:45:16.741 --> 00:45:19.290
<v Speaker 2>generally reflects obesity and you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>obese.</v>

968
00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:22.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you lift weights,</v>

969
00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:25.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm morbidly obese.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It seems so silly.</v>

970
00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:26.813
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at the general </v>

971
00:45:27.571 --> 00:45:30.690
<v Speaker 2>population who doesn't exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually pretty darn accurate.</v>

972
00:45:31.290 --> 00:45:34.230
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets factored into your insurance,</v>

973
00:45:34.410 --> 00:45:39.410
<v Speaker 2>which is not as it relates to your can </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at you and say some bs.</v>

974
00:45:39.780 --> 00:45:41.970
<v Speaker 2>Some insurances will do like a waist to </v>
<v Speaker 2>chest measurement,</v>

975
00:45:41.971 --> 00:45:42.751
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which helps,</v>

976
00:45:42.751 --> 00:45:46.500
<v Speaker 2>but anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so post Prandial Insulin,</v>

977
00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:47.393
<v Speaker 2>they've looked at the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>between people who have their BMS and </v>

978
00:45:50.371 --> 00:45:51.204
<v Speaker 2>post prandial insulin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They find that people with higher BMI </v>

979
00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:54.233
<v Speaker 2>have higher post Prandial insulin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the opposite relationship does not </v>

980
00:45:57.091 --> 00:46:00.000
<v Speaker 2>hold true for people who have higher </v>
<v Speaker 2>insulin,</v>

981
00:46:00.030 --> 00:46:03.510
<v Speaker 2>do not necessarily have higher bmi and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've done this in med analysis.</v>

982
00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:04.643
<v Speaker 2>So what that says is again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you are obese type two diabetic </v>

983
00:46:08.491 --> 00:46:09.324
<v Speaker 2>metabolic syndrome profile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you will have elevated levels of </v>

984
00:46:11.701 --> 00:46:12.534
<v Speaker 2>insulin because your body's becoming </v>
<v Speaker 2>insensitive to it because of all the </v>

985
00:46:15.751 --> 00:46:16.584
<v Speaker 2>dysfunction that we talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just because you secrete higher </v>

986
00:46:19.441 --> 00:46:22.770
<v Speaker 2>insulin doesn't mean that you're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to have more body fat.</v>

987
00:46:22.770 --> 00:46:23.603
<v Speaker 2>And there was a study done actually by </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the proponents of the </v>

988
00:46:25.471 --> 00:46:29.770
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrate insulin hypothesis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

989
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:30.743
<v Speaker 2>that looked at what's called Mendelian </v>
<v Speaker 2>randomization where basically the idea </v>

990
00:46:34.921 --> 00:46:37.770
<v Speaker 2>is you have different gene variants like</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were talking about.</v>

991
00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:41.130
<v Speaker 2>And if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

992
00:46:41.170 --> 00:46:43.780
<v Speaker 2>like they've done this with ldl </v>
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol are.</v>

993
00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:44.940
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

994
00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:45.893
<v Speaker 2>ldl cholesterol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We believe most people believe the ldl </v>

995
00:46:47.371 --> 00:46:50.430
<v Speaker 2>cholesterol has some contribution </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards heart disease.</v>

996
00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:52.860
<v Speaker 2>It's a pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say it's a pretty strong now.</v>

997
00:46:52.861 --> 00:46:57.861
<v Speaker 2>People can over controversial text </v>
<v Speaker 2>dependent and individual.</v>

998
00:46:58.110 --> 00:47:00.300
<v Speaker 2>When they look at these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these gene variants,</v>

999
00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:03.150
<v Speaker 2>people who have gene variants where they</v>
<v Speaker 2>run lower ldl,</v>

1000
00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:07.570
<v Speaker 2>have lower rates of heart disease,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are higher heart rates.</v>

1001
00:47:08.580 --> 00:47:12.150
<v Speaker 2>If you look at that with insulin at </v>
<v Speaker 2>best,</v>

1002
00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:17.420
<v Speaker 2>insulin explains 10 percent of obesity </v>
<v Speaker 2>at absolute best and that study actually</v>

1003
00:47:18.571 --> 00:47:22.020
<v Speaker 2>showed that high level of bias.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was between one to 10 percent.</v>

1004
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:25.740
<v Speaker 2>So we're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not putting out the,</v>

1005
00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:26.593
<v Speaker 2>the idea that maybe insulin has some </v>
<v Speaker 2>effect talking about fasting or post </v>

1006
00:47:29.831 --> 00:47:30.280
<v Speaker 2>Prandial</v>

1007
00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:31.270
<v Speaker 3>insulin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1008
00:47:31.330 --> 00:47:32.830
<v Speaker 3>overall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>overall,</v>

1009
00:47:32.930 --> 00:47:35.080
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm guessing probably more so fasting.</v>

1010
00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:37.770
<v Speaker 3>How did they measure insulin?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we,</v>

1011
00:47:37.800 --> 00:47:40.230
<v Speaker 3>we have hemoglobin h,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one c for like uh,</v>

1012
00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:42.030
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so there was another unit that,</v>

1013
00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:42.993
<v Speaker 2>there was another med analysis where </v>
<v Speaker 2>they looked at a higher carb versus </v>

1014
00:47:46.990 --> 00:47:50.290
<v Speaker 2>lower carb diets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>equating calories,</v>

1015
00:47:50.350 --> 00:47:53.560
<v Speaker 2>looking at Hba one c and saw that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

1016
00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:54.473
<v Speaker 2>the differences in weight loss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're no different like we've discussed </v>

1017
00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:59.980
<v Speaker 2>when calories are acquainted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also the differences in Hba.</v>

1018
00:47:59.981 --> 00:48:02.110
<v Speaker 2>One C reduction were different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were the same.</v>

1019
00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:03.873
<v Speaker 2>Now you asked about health and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>consuming some of these quote unquote </v>

1020
00:48:07.631 --> 00:48:08.464
<v Speaker 2>bad foods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do it in the but you said in the </v>

1021
00:48:10.991 --> 00:48:12.910
<v Speaker 2>context of a caloric surplus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

1022
00:48:13.210 --> 00:48:16.300
<v Speaker 2>which is the important thing because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they helped to create a surplus,</v>

1023
00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:19.840
<v Speaker 2>but in a deficit that what's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>downside?</v>

1024
00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:22.420
<v Speaker 2>Because kind of when you talk to people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who were not,</v>

1025
00:48:22.590 --> 00:48:23.423
<v Speaker 2>not ketogenic necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but proponents of quote unquote clean </v>

1026
00:48:25.331 --> 00:48:26.164
<v Speaker 2>eating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which again has no real objective </v>

1027
00:48:27.761 --> 00:48:30.310
<v Speaker 2>definition when you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1028
00:48:30.311 --> 00:48:31.920
<v Speaker 2>well a pop tart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe you can lose weight up,</v>

1029
00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:32.890
<v Speaker 2>it can't be good for you.</v>

1030
00:48:34.210 --> 00:48:36.520
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then we have to have some objective</v>

1031
00:48:36.521 --> 00:48:38.410
<v Speaker 2>measurement to show this by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1032
00:48:38.411 --> 00:48:40.900
<v Speaker 2>Like because otherwise it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you believe in magic?</v>

1033
00:48:41.110 --> 00:48:44.230
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you look at processed foods,</v>

1034
00:48:44.231 --> 00:48:45.064
<v Speaker 2>what they have found with processed </v>
<v Speaker 2>foods is that you have a lower energy </v>

1035
00:48:47.741 --> 00:48:49.150
<v Speaker 2>expenditure from them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

1036
00:48:49.151 --> 00:48:50.970
<v Speaker 2>so you have a certain amount of what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>call t e,</v>

1037
00:48:50.971 --> 00:48:51.804
<v Speaker 2>f thermic effective food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A higher protein has a higher t f than </v>

1038
00:48:55.571 --> 00:48:57.280
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrate and fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

1039
00:48:57.281 --> 00:48:58.114
<v Speaker 2>So we know the higher protein diets </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually cause more weight loss and </v>

1040
00:49:00.011 --> 00:49:00.844
<v Speaker 2>better lean body mass protection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of that is through the increase </v>

1041
00:49:03.671 --> 00:49:06.610
<v Speaker 2>thermogenesis of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the TF thermic effect of food.</v>

1042
00:49:07.030 --> 00:49:08.230
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with processed foods,</v>

1043
00:49:08.231 --> 00:49:09.064
<v Speaker 2>you have a lower tef okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that doesn't mean you can't eat any </v>

1044
00:49:11.741 --> 00:49:14.550
<v Speaker 2>processed foods and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and lose weight you can eat,</v>

1045
00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:17.080
<v Speaker 2>just means you might have to eat a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little bit lower calories overall.</v>

1046
00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:18.153
<v Speaker 2>Does that make sense?</v>

1047
00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:21.800
<v Speaker 3>There was a key to genic pop tart and it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was made with,</v>

1048
00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:27.150
<v Speaker 3>with almond tastes like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We know that if we amens were probably,</v>

1049
00:49:27.190 --> 00:49:28.023
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other nuts or things just given an </v>

1050
00:49:30.001 --> 00:49:31.000
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1051
00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:35.730
<v Speaker 3>we don't fully digest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>assimilate and utilize those calories.</v>

1052
00:49:35.731 --> 00:49:38.880
<v Speaker 3>They pass through us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So with the pop tart,</v>

1053
00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:41.070
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it's pretty high with like raw,</v>

1054
00:49:41.071 --> 00:49:41.904
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a salad with nuts and things like </v>

1055
00:49:43.441 --> 00:49:44.274
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it becomes significant over time </v>

1056
00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:47.063
<v Speaker 3>with the pop tart,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you can basically 100 percent of </v>

1057
00:49:49.291 --> 00:49:54.291
<v Speaker 3>that is going into your system and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>causing a hormonal response.</v>

1058
00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:55.493
<v Speaker 3>So the food that we eat creates is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>only calories but creates a hormonal </v>

1059
00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:02.543
<v Speaker 3>response and also from the brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective can change the </v>

1060
00:50:04.591 --> 00:50:06.180
<v Speaker 3>neuropharmacology of your brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1061
00:50:06.181 --> 00:50:07.014
<v Speaker 3>that's how I got into the key to genic </v>
<v Speaker 3>diet because it fundamentally changes </v>

1062
00:50:09.751 --> 00:50:12.420
<v Speaker 3>neurotransmitter systems and reward </v>
<v Speaker 3>systems.</v>

1063
00:50:12.421 --> 00:50:13.950
<v Speaker 3>And things like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

1064
00:50:13.951 --> 00:50:15.180
<v Speaker 3>but hormones,</v>

1065
00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:16.713
<v Speaker 2>people get so hung up on hormones and </v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you look at the research data </v>

1066
00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:21.850
<v Speaker 2>just doesn't support it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like with Insula,</v>

1067
00:50:21.851 --> 00:50:22.684
<v Speaker 2>whatnot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now in terms of like losing weight and </v>

1068
00:50:24.491 --> 00:50:25.324
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're what happens with Leptin and </v>

1069
00:50:26.261 --> 00:50:28.430
<v Speaker 2>Ghrelin and all those kinds of things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a huge.</v>

1070
00:50:29.150 --> 00:50:31.520
<v Speaker 2>One of the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things we talked about before</v>

1071
00:50:31.580 --> 00:50:32.413
<v Speaker 2>the podcast started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had about a 30 minute podcast and we </v>

1072
00:50:33.861 --> 00:50:37.450
<v Speaker 2>did actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1073
00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:38.293
<v Speaker 2>people say things like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons people are really </v>

1074
00:50:40.251 --> 00:50:41.084
<v Speaker 2>mistrustful of kind of the calories in </v>
<v Speaker 2>calories out model is because it is </v>

1075
00:50:44.931 --> 00:50:49.820
<v Speaker 2>viewed as a to isolated variables,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calories in,</v>

1076
00:50:49.821 --> 00:50:52.220
<v Speaker 2>calories out or separate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not true.</v>

1077
00:50:52.550 --> 00:50:54.530
<v Speaker 2>Calories in effects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Calories out.</v>

1078
00:50:55.070 --> 00:50:56.900
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are a moving target.</v>

1079
00:50:56.901 --> 00:50:57.734
<v Speaker 2>So people will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I ate in a calorie deficit and I </v>

1080
00:50:58.791 --> 00:51:00.530
<v Speaker 2>didn't lose weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1081
00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:01.393
<v Speaker 2>you ate and what you thought was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>calorie deficit and you didn't lose </v>

1082
00:51:03.771 --> 00:51:05.360
<v Speaker 2>weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you didn't lose weight,</v>

1083
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:08.300
<v Speaker 2>it was not a calorie deficit by </v>
<v Speaker 2>definition.</v>

1084
00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:10.910
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So retaining water or something.</v>

1085
00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:14.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's when we look at dieting,</v>

1086
00:51:14.550 --> 00:51:18.200
<v Speaker 2>like just dieting in general over time </v>
<v Speaker 2>lowers your metabolic rate,</v>

1087
00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:20.510
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you take somebody,</v>

1088
00:51:20.511 --> 00:51:22.190
<v Speaker 2>they actually did a rat study.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

1089
00:51:22.250 --> 00:51:23.083
<v Speaker 2>rats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but rats tend to respond pretty similar </v>

1090
00:51:25.041 --> 00:51:25.874
<v Speaker 2>to humans into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you agree with that in terms of </v>

1091
00:51:26.811 --> 00:51:27.320
<v Speaker 2>blood?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1092
00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:29.930
<v Speaker 2>you do a lot of rats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rats and mouse studies.</v>

1093
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.740
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1094
00:51:30.740 --> 00:51:33.140
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of overlap there.</v>

1095
00:51:33.141 --> 00:51:33.974
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're good model.</v>

1096
00:51:34.490 --> 00:51:35.323
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we have to put that out there </v>

1097
00:51:36.201 --> 00:51:38.540
<v Speaker 2>because we want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't want to oversell it.</v>

1098
00:51:38.600 --> 00:51:39.433
<v Speaker 2>They did A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>depends on the context of what you're </v>

1099
00:51:41.001 --> 00:51:42.080
<v Speaker 2>studying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

1100
00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:46.640
<v Speaker 2>like you don't want it to be like animal</v>
<v Speaker 2>studies can be helpful,</v>

1101
00:51:46.641 --> 00:51:50.480
<v Speaker 2>but you don't want to do like an insulin</v>
<v Speaker 2>study in cows because cows are ruminants</v>

1102
00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:53.720
<v Speaker 2>in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't care about insulin anyway,</v>

1103
00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:55.040
<v Speaker 2>they took rats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they took them to,</v>

1104
00:51:55.041 --> 00:51:56.090
<v Speaker 2>to diet cycles.</v>

1105
00:51:56.330 --> 00:51:57.163
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is kind of back to the Yoyo </v>

1106
00:51:58.430 --> 00:51:59.970
<v Speaker 2>dieting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1107
00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:00.853
<v Speaker 2>and they looked at okay and they took </v>
<v Speaker 2>obese rats of them down to a kind of </v>

1108
00:52:05.390 --> 00:52:06.223
<v Speaker 2>normal level than they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>than they basically gave him as much </v>

1109
00:52:08.361 --> 00:52:09.194
<v Speaker 2>food as they want to let him eat back to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the original obese level dye to them </v>

1110
00:52:13.161 --> 00:52:16.550
<v Speaker 2>down again to the previous level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then let him read back up.</v>

1111
00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:18.770
<v Speaker 2>What they found was absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 2>astonishing.</v>

1112
00:52:19.100 --> 00:52:19.933
<v Speaker 2>There are food efficiency with so far up</v>
<v Speaker 2>because their metabolic rate became </v>

1113
00:52:22.761 --> 00:52:24.200
<v Speaker 2>suppressed every time they died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It down.</v>

1114
00:52:24.201 --> 00:52:27.590
<v Speaker 2>Your body has this self defense system </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you activate every time you dye it.</v>

1115
00:52:27.591 --> 00:52:29.840
<v Speaker 2>I talk about this in my shameless plug </v>
<v Speaker 2>book.</v>

1116
00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:32.340
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the first time they died,</v>

1117
00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:36.510
<v Speaker 2>if that's the kind of one times rate </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they lost a fat ass,</v>

1118
00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:38.233
<v Speaker 2>when they let them regain it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they regained it twice as fast as they </v>

1119
00:52:40.851 --> 00:52:41.660
<v Speaker 2>lost it.</v>

1120
00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:43.370
<v Speaker 2>Then the second time they tried to lose </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1121
00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:47.930
<v Speaker 2>they lost it at half the original rate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then when they regained it,</v>

1122
00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:48.853
<v Speaker 2>the second time they gave you gained it </v>
<v Speaker 2>three times as fast their food </v>

1123
00:52:51.801 --> 00:52:54.650
<v Speaker 2>efficiency would weigh up the ability to</v>
<v Speaker 2>lose it.</v>

1124
00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:56.000
<v Speaker 2>Have you noticed?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you noticed?</v>

1125
00:52:56.001 --> 00:52:56.990
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's that?</v>

1126
00:52:57.680 --> 00:53:00.950
<v Speaker 2>Lucid get faster as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1127
00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:01.993
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They took him twice as long to lose the </v>

1128
00:53:04.221 --> 00:53:05.650
<v Speaker 2>same amount of weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

1129
00:53:05.651 --> 00:53:07.610
<v Speaker 2>I probably didn't explain it very well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1130
00:53:07.611 --> 00:53:08.444
<v Speaker 2>I took him twice as long to lose the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same amount of weight and they regained </v>

1131
00:53:10.131 --> 00:53:10.964
<v Speaker 2>it in a third the time of the original.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your body's getting accustomed to </v>

1132
00:53:14.181 --> 00:53:15.710
<v Speaker 2>famine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1133
00:53:15.770 --> 00:53:16.603
<v Speaker 2>Because every time you diet it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we see this with yo Yo dieters who </v>

1134
00:53:19.161 --> 00:53:19.994
<v Speaker 2>spend.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many people do you know that seemed </v>

1135
00:53:21.141 --> 00:53:24.620
<v Speaker 2>to be perpetually on a diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they just had that short overfeeding</v>

1136
00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:26.530
<v Speaker 2>period in between diets underneath.</v>

1137
00:53:27.460 --> 00:53:28.293
<v Speaker 2>It really does because every time you </v>
<v Speaker 2>died you're activating your body self </v>

1138
00:53:30.711 --> 00:53:34.650
<v Speaker 2>defense system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many fighters do you know that every</v>

1139
00:53:34.651 --> 00:53:37.080
<v Speaker 2>time they die it gets harder and harder </v>
<v Speaker 2>for them to make weight.</v>

1140
00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:38.780
<v Speaker 2>While they're doing more than that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're.</v>

1141
00:53:38.781 --> 00:53:41.520
<v Speaker 2>They're cutting weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cutting weight is ruthless.</v>

1142
00:53:41.521 --> 00:53:43.590
<v Speaker 2>They're essentially almost dying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1143
00:53:43.591 --> 00:53:46.920
<v Speaker 2>But part of that is there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're having to crash diet super low.</v>

1144
00:53:46.921 --> 00:53:48.630
<v Speaker 2>So what is the signal you're telling </v>
<v Speaker 2>your body?</v>

1145
00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:50.730
<v Speaker 2>Because you have to always think about </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1146
00:53:50.731 --> 00:53:54.630
<v Speaker 2>From an evolutionary perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Phd advisor was great about this,</v>

1147
00:53:54.631 --> 00:53:56.580
<v Speaker 2>he'd always asked his name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was Dr Don Lemon,</v>

1148
00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:58.860
<v Speaker 2>brilliant guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he would say,</v>

1149
00:53:59.130 --> 00:54:01.410
<v Speaker 2>why do you think the body did this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1150
00:54:01.411 --> 00:54:02.244
<v Speaker 2>if you think about what are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>regulatory mechanisms of becoming fat </v>

1151
00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:08.610
<v Speaker 2>versus becoming too thin?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1152
00:54:08.611 --> 00:54:11.340
<v Speaker 2>So one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one danger is you starve to death.</v>

1153
00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:14.580
<v Speaker 2>The other danger is you get so fat that </v>
<v Speaker 2>a Predator can come get you,</v>

1154
00:54:14.970 --> 00:54:18.180
<v Speaker 2>which is more dangerous in the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>20,000</v>

1155
00:54:18.181 --> 00:54:19.160
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's family,</v>

1156
00:54:20.210 --> 00:54:21.043
<v Speaker 2>it's family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your body creates much tighter </v>

1157
00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:26.550
<v Speaker 2>defense system there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you diet,</v>

1158
00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:30.230
<v Speaker 2>your metabolic rate slows way down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you've,</v>

1159
00:54:30.250 --> 00:54:31.083
<v Speaker 2>you've ever these guys who cut weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so by the time they're ready to get a </v>

1160
00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:35.820
<v Speaker 2>fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

1161
00:54:36.510 --> 00:54:39.660
<v Speaker 2>their metabolic rates really slow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then what happens after they fight,</v>

1162
00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:41.900
<v Speaker 2>they eat a crap ton of food because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're there,</v>

1163
00:54:42.090 --> 00:54:44.640
<v Speaker 2>they're Grelin is way up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leptin is way down,</v>

1164
00:54:44.641 --> 00:54:47.670
<v Speaker 2>insulin is way down and they regain it </v>
<v Speaker 2>really fast.</v>

1165
00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:49.510
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what</v>

1166
00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:53.120
<v Speaker 3>to assume?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just to interject that if you die it for</v>

1167
00:54:53.121 --> 00:54:54.950
<v Speaker 3>16 weeks for a show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

1168
00:54:54.951 --> 00:54:55.784
<v Speaker 3>or a contest that what you actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>educated me in like 10 years ago and I </v>

1169
00:55:00.651 --> 00:55:04.640
<v Speaker 3>thought there was this like post contest</v>
<v Speaker 3>rebound and in two weeks there'd be this</v>

1170
00:55:04.641 --> 00:55:07.580
<v Speaker 3>anabolic window or whatever for fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It actually,</v>

1171
00:55:07.610 --> 00:55:10.550
<v Speaker 3>if you die hard for 16 weeks to make </v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

1172
00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:11.473
<v Speaker 3>it takes an equal amount of time to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>your metabolism back actually to that </v>

1173
00:55:14.481 --> 00:55:15.314
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Again,</v>

1174
00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:17.720
<v Speaker 3>maybe d.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So lane coined the term,</v>

1175
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:19.220
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Reverse dieting river,</v>

1176
00:55:19.370 --> 00:55:23.120
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I call,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pointed it and did this with metabolic</v>

1177
00:55:23.121 --> 00:55:23.954
<v Speaker 3>chambers and in rats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then use a variety of different </v>

1178
00:55:25.701 --> 00:55:29.650
<v Speaker 3>approaches to determine how fast it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it actually takes to,</v>

1179
00:55:29.690 --> 00:55:31.770
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to bring your metabolism backup.</v>

1180
00:55:31.790 --> 00:55:35.840
<v Speaker 3>And if different strategies can be used </v>
<v Speaker 3>to ramp up your metabolism,</v>

1181
00:55:35.950 --> 00:55:37.720
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because when you regain it,</v>

1182
00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:43.090
<v Speaker 2>you regain fat really quickly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but your metabolic rate is more sluggish</v>

1183
00:55:43.091 --> 00:55:43.924
<v Speaker 2>to return.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they actually did a study with the </v>

1184
00:55:45.790 --> 00:55:46.623
<v Speaker 2>biggest loser participants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is why I'm so big on what is </v>

1185
00:55:48.811 --> 00:55:51.280
<v Speaker 2>sustainable that it has to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>sustainable.</v>

1186
00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:55.060
<v Speaker 2>They looked at um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they last on average,</v>

1187
00:55:55.061 --> 00:55:58.690
<v Speaker 2>like a quite a bit of weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember the exact numbers,</v>

1188
00:55:58.691 --> 00:55:59.524
<v Speaker 2>but they lost a bunch of weight over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 weeks because they starve them and </v>

1189
00:56:01.781 --> 00:56:02.614
<v Speaker 2>they exercised the crap out of them and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they saw that their metabolic rate </v>

1190
00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:08.913
<v Speaker 2>dropped 500 calories more than you would</v>
<v Speaker 2>predict just by the amount of body fat </v>

1191
00:56:14.290 --> 00:56:15.123
<v Speaker 2>and lean body mass they lose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what's called metabolic </v>

1192
00:56:16.571 --> 00:56:17.404
<v Speaker 2>adaptation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you defined the metabolic rate </v>

1193
00:56:18.911 --> 00:56:20.210
<v Speaker 2>dropping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you mean by that?</v>

1194
00:56:20.220 --> 00:56:21.190
<v Speaker 2>What's the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So?</v>

1195
00:56:21.191 --> 00:56:24.220
<v Speaker 2>So you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we can calculate all this stuff.</v>

1196
00:56:24.220 --> 00:56:26.530
<v Speaker 2>So your overall total daily energy </v>
<v Speaker 2>expenditure,</v>

1197
00:56:26.531 --> 00:56:29.590
<v Speaker 2>you're tde is made up of your basal </v>
<v Speaker 2>metabolic rate,</v>

1198
00:56:29.770 --> 00:56:30.603
<v Speaker 2>which is what you burn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what we're doing right now just </v>

1199
00:56:32.261 --> 00:56:34.780
<v Speaker 2>sitting around doing oxygen consumption </v>
<v Speaker 2>car to production.</v>

1200
00:56:34.890 --> 00:56:39.730
<v Speaker 2>I actually actually to be real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just laying down doing nothing.</v>

1201
00:56:39.731 --> 00:56:41.770
<v Speaker 2>So basically the energy you burn keeping</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lights on,</v>

1202
00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:43.360
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one component.</v>

1203
00:56:43.361 --> 00:56:45.670
<v Speaker 2>It's about 50 to 60 percent in most </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1204
00:56:46.150 --> 00:56:48.760
<v Speaker 2>Then you have your neat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is like this,</v>

1205
00:56:48.761 --> 00:56:51.520
<v Speaker 2>like I'm moving my hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm ambulatory movement,</v>

1206
00:56:51.521 --> 00:56:52.354
<v Speaker 2>non voluntary movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This stuff will actually go down when </v>

1207
00:56:54.431 --> 00:56:56.860
<v Speaker 2>you diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you've ever been around,</v>

1208
00:56:56.861 --> 00:56:58.150
<v Speaker 2>people will go down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1209
00:56:58.151 --> 00:57:00.280
<v Speaker 2>You stopped fidget.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spontaneous movement goes down.</v>

1210
00:57:00.670 --> 00:57:04.180
<v Speaker 2>It's a huge modifier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like if you look at either the DVD,</v>

1211
00:57:04.181 --> 00:57:06.040
<v Speaker 2>when I was prepping for a show back in </v>
<v Speaker 2>2010,</v>

1212
00:57:06.220 --> 00:57:09.250
<v Speaker 2>I blink slower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not kidding.</v>

1213
00:57:09.251 --> 00:57:10.600
<v Speaker 2>You and I talk slower.</v>

1214
00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:13.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mind you were like on volume.</v>

1215
00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:15.160
<v Speaker 2>It looks like you're.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're right.</v>

1216
00:57:15.161 --> 00:57:18.400
<v Speaker 2>Now I'm all hyped up on in the life of </v>
<v Speaker 2>lane with that says,</v>

1217
00:57:19.810 --> 00:57:22.540
<v Speaker 2>oh absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you're so your body,</v>

1218
00:57:22.541 --> 00:57:24.310
<v Speaker 2>this is your body genic di would help </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1219
00:57:24.580 --> 00:57:26.680
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you think about.</v>

1220
00:57:27.250 --> 00:57:28.600
<v Speaker 2>So there's neat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's that.</v>

1221
00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:30.790
<v Speaker 2>Then your exercise activity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is intuitive,</v>

1222
00:57:30.791 --> 00:57:32.410
<v Speaker 2>that's how many calories you burn </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercising,</v>

1223
00:57:32.411 --> 00:57:34.120
<v Speaker 2>and then there's what's called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>thermic effect of food,</v>

1224
00:57:34.121 --> 00:57:34.954
<v Speaker 2>which we already discussed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How much energy required to get energy </v>

1225
00:57:37.121 --> 00:57:38.030
<v Speaker 2>out of food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1226
00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:39.783
<v Speaker 2>And all those add up to your total daily</v>
<v Speaker 2>energy expenditure and we can predict </v>

1227
00:57:43.990 --> 00:57:47.920
<v Speaker 2>based on equations how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what your metabolic rate should be.</v>

1228
00:57:48.340 --> 00:57:49.173
<v Speaker 2>So these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their metabolic rate was 500 calories a </v>

1229
00:57:51.071 --> 00:57:51.904
<v Speaker 2>day lower than it should have been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just based off the weight they lost </v>

1230
00:57:54.911 --> 00:57:59.110
<v Speaker 2>because if you lose muscle and lose fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have less weight to carry around,</v>

1231
00:57:59.200 --> 00:57:59.470
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1232
00:57:59.470 --> 00:58:01.300
<v Speaker 2>So your metabolic rate goes down just </v>
<v Speaker 2>from that,</v>

1233
00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:03.670
<v Speaker 2>but it goes down way more than it </v>
<v Speaker 2>should.</v>

1234
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:04.983
<v Speaker 2>That is your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first prong of your body self </v>

1235
00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:10.210
<v Speaker 2>defense system to stop you from starving</v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself is to become more efficient.</v>

1236
00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:12.340
<v Speaker 2>We hear the word efficiency and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

1237
00:58:12.341 --> 00:58:12.790
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's.</v>

1238
00:58:12.790 --> 00:58:15.850
<v Speaker 2>That's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about if your body fat levels were</v>

1239
00:58:15.851 --> 00:58:18.490
<v Speaker 2>a gas tank and you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had a car,</v>

1240
00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:20.680
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would not want to be efficient,</v>

1241
00:58:20.740 --> 00:58:22.500
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You to have one of the old suburbans,</v>

1242
00:58:22.530 --> 00:58:24.130
<v Speaker 2>it was like half a mile per gallon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1243
00:58:24.131 --> 00:58:26.470
<v Speaker 2>You don't want the Prius because you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>go way longer.</v>

1244
00:58:26.890 --> 00:58:27.723
<v Speaker 2>So going back to that study on rats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they became so much more efficient with </v>

1245
00:58:30.821 --> 00:58:31.654
<v Speaker 2>their food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is the second prong of your </v>

1246
00:58:33.431 --> 00:58:37.510
<v Speaker 2>body is self defense system is to not </v>
<v Speaker 2>only slow down your metabolic rate while</v>

1247
00:58:37.511 --> 00:58:38.344
<v Speaker 2>you're dieting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to start activating systems that </v>

1248
00:58:40.961 --> 00:58:42.160
<v Speaker 2>deal with restoring.</v>

1249
00:58:42.640 --> 00:58:44.290
<v Speaker 2>Once you actually start overeating </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

1250
00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:45.633
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever done a long diet or known </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody who did it and then they start </v>

1251
00:58:47.861 --> 00:58:49.660
<v Speaker 2>eating again?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like everything sticks to you.</v>

1252
00:58:50.010 --> 00:58:51.700
<v Speaker 2>It's like you just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you like,</v>

1253
00:58:51.701 --> 00:58:54.580
<v Speaker 2>how did I gain five pounds from one day </v>
<v Speaker 2>and people are like,</v>

1254
00:58:54.610 --> 00:58:55.443
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's water.</v>

1255
00:58:55.450 --> 00:58:56.283
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>water doesn't stay around for six </v>

1256
00:58:56.861 --> 00:58:57.694
<v Speaker 2>months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's not water that is your body </v>

1257
00:59:00.791 --> 00:59:01.624
<v Speaker 2>preparing all these systems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so even like enzymes that deal with fat </v>

1258
00:59:04.361 --> 00:59:05.194
<v Speaker 2>storage while you're dieting actually go</v>
<v Speaker 2>up because it's preparing your body for </v>

1259
00:59:08.291 --> 00:59:09.124
<v Speaker 2>restoring and then even probably the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most interesting thing is it all falls </v>

1260
00:59:13.811 --> 00:59:17.020
<v Speaker 2>back on the importance of tracking </v>
<v Speaker 2>Macros,</v>

1261
00:59:17.050 --> 00:59:17.883
<v Speaker 2>which is completely ignored with guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming off of a fight or fitness </v>

1262
00:59:23.190 --> 00:59:26.180
<v Speaker 2>competitors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let yourself blow up really quickly.</v>

1263
00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:30.470
<v Speaker 2>It's a myth that your body is set up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be anabolic or to gain muscle.</v>

1264
00:59:30.500 --> 00:59:32.530
<v Speaker 2>That is for your setup for fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1265
00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:36.860
<v Speaker 2>but the point I'm trying to make is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way most people diet,</v>

1266
00:59:37.070 --> 00:59:38.240
<v Speaker 2>which is this kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1267
00:59:38.241 --> 00:59:39.074
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've probably been around people who </v>

1268
00:59:39.861 --> 00:59:42.050
<v Speaker 2>do this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot of people,</v>

1269
00:59:42.550 --> 00:59:45.260
<v Speaker 2>they they pick the next fad diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever's popular,</v>

1270
00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:46.153
<v Speaker 2>they do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they lose some weight and the navy gain </v>

1271
00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:47.893
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Dad lost 30 pounds on a ketogenic </v>

1272
00:59:48.651 --> 00:59:51.410
<v Speaker 2>diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>regained 50 right now.</v>

1273
00:59:51.710 --> 00:59:55.190
<v Speaker 2>The real problem is in the macros.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now he does,</v>

1274
00:59:55.940 --> 00:59:57.710
<v Speaker 2>but the real problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's down 50 pounds again,</v>

1275
00:59:57.830 --> 01:00:02.830
<v Speaker 2>but the real problem is if we used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>think adipose tissue is like a sponge,</v>

1276
01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:05.900
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you ate too much,</v>

1277
01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:07.940
<v Speaker 2>you just threw more in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1278
01:00:07.941 --> 01:00:11.600
<v Speaker 2>Soaked up extra nutrients,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then if you started,</v>

1279
01:00:11.780 --> 01:00:13.640
<v Speaker 2>if you're in a caloric deficit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were losing weight.</v>

1280
01:00:13.670 --> 01:00:15.980
<v Speaker 2>It just gave up some of its nutrients.</v>

1281
01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:18.380
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the guy who fasted for 365 days and</v>

1282
01:00:18.381 --> 01:00:20.960
<v Speaker 2>didn't die because he had so much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much fat.</v>

1283
01:00:22.610 --> 01:00:26.360
<v Speaker 2>We now know that body fat fits every </v>
<v Speaker 2>definition of a,</v>

1284
01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:28.670
<v Speaker 2>of an inadequate system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a tissue.</v>

1285
01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:32.810
<v Speaker 2>It is an actual organ because it sends </v>
<v Speaker 2>out hormonal signals,</v>

1286
01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:35.150
<v Speaker 2>it integrates hormonal signals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it talks to the brain,</v>

1287
01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:38.720
<v Speaker 2>the Hindbrain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the arcuate nucleus is integrated in all</v>

1288
01:00:38.721 --> 01:00:43.220
<v Speaker 2>of metabolism in a big way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and typically you have.</v>

1289
01:00:43.370 --> 01:00:46.820
<v Speaker 2>The way we gain fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lose fat is based on the fat cell size.</v>

1290
01:00:47.150 --> 01:00:50.120
<v Speaker 2>So you have a set number of fat cells </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the other expand,</v>

1291
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:50.983
<v Speaker 2>or they shrink pretty intuitive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless now you can create more fat </v>

1292
01:00:55.641 --> 01:00:56.474
<v Speaker 2>cells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you become so obese that you </v>

1293
01:00:58.341 --> 01:00:59.990
<v Speaker 2>literally can't stuff any more fat in </v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

1294
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:01.063
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So obese people have fat cell </v>

1295
01:01:02.601 --> 01:01:06.410
<v Speaker 2>hyperplasia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times what's really interesting</v>

1296
01:01:06.411 --> 01:01:08.600
<v Speaker 2>is people at the end of a diet when </v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

1297
01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:09.763
<v Speaker 2>when your thyroid hormone is lower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your sympathetic nervous system tone is </v>

1298
01:01:12.201 --> 01:01:12.770
<v Speaker 2>lower.</v>

1299
01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:14.330
<v Speaker 2>This unique hormonal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>May Lou,</v>

1300
01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:17.930
<v Speaker 2>if you overfeed to rapidly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a researcher named Mclean out of</v>

1301
01:01:17.931 --> 01:01:18.764
<v Speaker 2>Colorado that actually showed that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can actually increase your fat cell </v>

1302
01:01:20.781 --> 01:01:25.310
<v Speaker 2>number if you overfeed to rapidly right </v>
<v Speaker 2>after a diet.</v>

1303
01:01:26.090 --> 01:01:26.990
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was in rats,</v>

1304
01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:31.190
<v Speaker 2>full disclosure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was fascinating stuff.</v>

1305
01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:33.133
<v Speaker 2>Now you're increasing your body's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it makes sense from an evolutionary </v>

1306
01:01:36.081 --> 01:01:37.880
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your body's like,</v>

1307
01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:39.380
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had this famine.</v>

1308
01:01:39.410 --> 01:01:40.730
<v Speaker 2>We don't want to deal with this shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

1309
01:01:40.731 --> 01:01:43.310
<v Speaker 2>We want to make sure that we can store </v>
<v Speaker 2>as much stuff as possible,</v>

1310
01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:46.970
<v Speaker 2>so we're going to create some new.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This dude is rapidly overfeeding.</v>

1311
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:49.700
<v Speaker 2>We're going to create some new fat cells</v>
<v Speaker 2>to make sure we're not going to miss any</v>

1312
01:01:49.701 --> 01:01:50.534
<v Speaker 2>of this energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to capture every single bit </v>

1313
01:01:51.501 --> 01:01:51.740
<v Speaker 2>of it.</v>

1314
01:01:51.740 --> 01:01:54.220
<v Speaker 5>I like what you're saying and it makes a</v>
<v Speaker 5>lot of sense.</v>

1315
01:01:54.460 --> 01:01:56.440
<v Speaker 5>You're talking about weight loss and </v>
<v Speaker 5>weight gain,</v>

1316
01:01:56.441 --> 01:01:57.274
<v Speaker 5>but you were specifically discussing </v>
<v Speaker 5>hormonal changes in the body due to the </v>

1317
01:02:00.521 --> 01:02:01.354
<v Speaker 5>ketogenic diet that are beneficial and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that these hormonal changes and the </v>

1318
01:02:05.021 --> 01:02:05.854
<v Speaker 5>changes to the way the brain functions </v>
<v Speaker 5>would be a benefit of following that </v>

1319
01:02:10.241 --> 01:02:13.120
<v Speaker 5>diet versus just working on calories.</v>

1320
01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:14.673
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's at that book I gave you the </v>

1321
01:02:15.971 --> 01:02:18.550
<v Speaker 2>complete book of Ketones by Dr Marion.</v>

1322
01:02:20.310 --> 01:02:21.180
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1323
01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:22.413
<v Speaker 3>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's actually out yet </v>

1324
01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:28.600
<v Speaker 3>because prep guide going to get jacked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So ketones are hints of Beta.</v>

1325
01:02:29.891 --> 01:02:31.140
<v Speaker 3>There a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1326
01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:33.353
<v Speaker 3>there are sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by definition have a metabolic </v>

1327
01:02:35.521 --> 01:02:38.580
<v Speaker 3>superiority as a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a fuel source,</v>

1328
01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:39.743
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they readily cross the blood brain </v>

1329
01:02:40.801 --> 01:02:41.634
<v Speaker 3>barrier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can largely replace glucose as the </v>

1330
01:02:43.501 --> 01:02:44.334
<v Speaker 3>primary energy source in your brain </v>
<v Speaker 3>under periods of fasting a or ketogenic </v>

1331
01:02:47.731 --> 01:02:49.440
<v Speaker 3>diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that,</v>

1332
01:02:49.950 --> 01:02:50.783
<v Speaker 3>that offers a lot of advantages to </v>
<v Speaker 3>someone dieting because it makes you </v>

1333
01:02:55.591 --> 01:02:58.200
<v Speaker 3>resilient.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the guy that fast at 382 days,</v>

1334
01:02:58.590 --> 01:03:01.650
<v Speaker 3>his glucose was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like 30 and dipped down the 20.</v>

1335
01:03:02.230 --> 01:03:04.380
<v Speaker 3>That would be universally fatal for most</v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

1336
01:03:04.381 --> 01:03:06.690
<v Speaker 3>But as ketones were elevated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so he did not feel hunger.</v>

1337
01:03:06.900 --> 01:03:08.360
<v Speaker 3>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is true.</v>

1338
01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.790
<v Speaker 3>Like the Cahill Studies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>George Cahill,</v>

1339
01:03:10.860 --> 01:03:15.060
<v Speaker 3>a studies at Harvard medical school </v>
<v Speaker 3>where they fasted subjects for 40 days,</v>

1340
01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:19.350
<v Speaker 3>they injected insulin to increase what </v>
<v Speaker 3>are,</v>

1341
01:03:19.370 --> 01:03:23.520
<v Speaker 3>did two that I remember presenting this </v>
<v Speaker 3>Atliens camp a while back.</v>

1342
01:03:23.730 --> 01:03:25.230
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I,</v>

1343
01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:26.160
<v Speaker 3>when I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1344
01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:28.380
<v Speaker 3>read this study,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to call him on the phone,</v>

1345
01:03:28.381 --> 01:03:30.480
<v Speaker 3>he was living,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he passed away in 2012,</v>

1346
01:03:30.481 --> 01:03:31.314
<v Speaker 3>but we had a number of conversations </v>
<v Speaker 3>before he passed away and I was amazed </v>

1347
01:03:34.501 --> 01:03:35.334
<v Speaker 3>that he got ethics approval to do that </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's basically like killing </v>

1348
01:03:37.621 --> 01:03:38.454
<v Speaker 3>someone injecting 20 I use of insulin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what was fascinating that they were </v>

1349
01:03:42.361 --> 01:03:43.194
<v Speaker 3>asymptomatic for hypoglycemia at a level</v>
<v Speaker 3>of hypoglycemia that's typically </v>

1350
01:03:47.350 --> 01:03:48.183
<v Speaker 3>universally fatal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they were also a very cognitively </v>

1351
01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:54.720
<v Speaker 3>lucid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that was a dramatic demonstration at</v>

1352
01:03:54.721 --> 01:03:56.340
<v Speaker 3>the time it was thought that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1353
01:03:56.490 --> 01:04:00.900
<v Speaker 3>the brain could only use glucose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is a paradigm shift in the way,</v>

1354
01:04:01.130 --> 01:04:01.963
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we understand sort of fuel utilization </v>

1355
01:04:04.231 --> 01:04:05.064
<v Speaker 3>and particularly in the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that has major and I can go on and </v>

1356
01:04:09.241 --> 01:04:11.190
<v Speaker 3>talking about the different applications</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the Ketogenic Diet,</v>

1357
01:04:11.191 --> 01:04:12.630
<v Speaker 3>which I did on the first podcast.</v>

1358
01:04:12.930 --> 01:04:13.763
<v Speaker 3>But from a perspective of someone </v>
<v Speaker 3>dieting to lose weight dieting as a </v>

1359
01:04:18.961 --> 01:04:21.270
<v Speaker 3>lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing intermittent fasting,</v>

1360
01:04:21.271 --> 01:04:22.104
<v Speaker 3>the key to genic diet makes intermittent</v>
<v Speaker 3>fasting much easier because your brains </v>

1361
01:04:24.451 --> 01:04:27.690
<v Speaker 3>adapted to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That for me had tremendous,</v>

1362
01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:33.100
<v Speaker 3>a practical applications that allowed me</v>
<v Speaker 3>to excel through academia.</v>

1363
01:04:33.210 --> 01:04:35.880
<v Speaker 3>I was able to do a lot more work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not get hungry.</v>

1364
01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:37.920
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

1365
01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:39.990
<v Speaker 3>Lena,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we haven't trained in a while,</v>

1366
01:04:39.991 --> 01:04:42.930
<v Speaker 3>but when we train last night we did dead</v>
<v Speaker 3>lifts.</v>

1367
01:04:42.931 --> 01:04:46.930
<v Speaker 3>I mean we were doing both deadlifting </v>
<v Speaker 3>six 75 for reps and I was on,</v>

1368
01:04:47.130 --> 01:04:48.150
<v Speaker 3>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was on the,</v>

1369
01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:49.433
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1370
01:04:50.070 --> 01:04:50.903
<v Speaker 3>the classical ketogenic diet then that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was just doing it and it out to </v>

1371
01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:56.970
<v Speaker 3>your school versus like an 80 to 90 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent fat.</v>

1372
01:04:57.020 --> 01:05:00.180
<v Speaker 3>And I was doing that for about a year </v>
<v Speaker 3>and um,</v>

1373
01:05:00.930 --> 01:05:01.763
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dead lifting like three times my body </v>

1374
01:05:03.001 --> 01:05:04.380
<v Speaker 3>weight for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for Reps,</v>

1375
01:05:04.770 --> 01:05:06.930
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it didn't hurt me.</v>

1376
01:05:07.050 --> 01:05:08.700
<v Speaker 3>I can't say that would be the case for </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone,</v>

1377
01:05:08.701 --> 01:05:13.020
<v Speaker 3>but I also titrated the calories in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't really at a calorie deficit.</v>

1378
01:05:13.021 --> 01:05:13.854
<v Speaker 3>I lost a little bit of ways.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I guess by definition I was at a </v>

1379
01:05:16.291 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 3>calorie deficit now for people that are</v>

1380
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:20.830
<v Speaker 4>thinking about gains,</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to gain weight,</v>

1381
01:05:20.890 --> 01:05:23.140
<v Speaker 4>they would think that the key to genic </v>
<v Speaker 4>at that 80,</v>

1382
01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:25.240
<v Speaker 4>90 percent fat would not be enough </v>
<v Speaker 4>protein.</v>

1383
01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:30.300
<v Speaker 4>I believe that the ketogenic diet shines</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you are in a calorie deficit.</v>

1384
01:05:30.610 --> 01:05:33.640
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my mentor for the cancer work,</v>

1385
01:05:33.641 --> 01:05:34.474
<v Speaker 4>Tom Seyfried had published a study </v>
<v Speaker 4>showing an unrestricted ketogenic diet </v>

1386
01:05:38.111 --> 01:05:41.380
<v Speaker 4>can actually promote cancer growth in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain tumor model.</v>

1387
01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:43.940
<v Speaker 4>Unrestricted meaning too much calories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1388
01:05:43.941 --> 01:05:44.774
<v Speaker 4>They were feeding mice a sugary at key </v>
<v Speaker 4>to genic formula that was on the market </v>

1389
01:05:47.861 --> 01:05:48.694
<v Speaker 4>at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1390
01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:49.990
<v Speaker 4>it was a sweetened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>

1391
01:05:49.991 --> 01:05:50.824
<v Speaker 4>It was sweet and cute.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Agentic formula with hydrogenated fats </v>

1392
01:05:53.410 --> 01:05:54.340
<v Speaker 4>and other things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1393
01:05:54.940 --> 01:05:55.773
<v Speaker 4>it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as sweetened with maybe with aspartame </v>

1394
01:05:58.211 --> 01:05:59.044
<v Speaker 4>or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they might tend to overeat it and </v>

1395
01:06:01.391 --> 01:06:02.770
<v Speaker 4>when they overeat it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1396
01:06:02.771 --> 01:06:07.590
<v Speaker 4>it creates a plethora of metabolic </v>
<v Speaker 4>abnormalities and uh,</v>

1397
01:06:08.490 --> 01:06:10.810
<v Speaker 4>you also get those same mountain rallies</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you over eat carbs.</v>

1398
01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:12.220
<v Speaker 4>You didn't say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's me being,</v>

1399
01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:13.593
<v Speaker 4>just as a side note,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much does it drive you guys crazy </v>

1400
01:06:15.041 --> 01:06:19.370
<v Speaker 4>when you hear about this fat acceptance </v>
<v Speaker 4>thing or fat is healthy when you be fat.</v>

1401
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:24.040
<v Speaker 4>So much of this going around to </v>
<v Speaker 4>massively obese people,</v>

1402
01:06:24.170 --> 01:06:26.110
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to say it's okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fine.</v>

1403
01:06:26.111 --> 01:06:27.820
<v Speaker 4>You're your football players,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1404
01:06:27.821 --> 01:06:30.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by definition they're pretty healthy.</v>

1405
01:06:30.251 --> 01:06:31.270
<v Speaker 4>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they lift,</v>

1406
01:06:31.271 --> 01:06:34.930
<v Speaker 4>they train a metabolically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their bloodwork kind of looks okay,</v>

1407
01:06:34.990 --> 01:06:35.823
<v Speaker 4>so you have guts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they're not surprise you with my </v>

1408
01:06:38.711 --> 01:06:39.544
<v Speaker 4>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1409
01:06:39.750 --> 01:06:40.870
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

1410
01:06:41.070 --> 01:06:42.130
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we talked about this earlier,</v>

1411
01:06:42.131 --> 01:06:44.050
<v Speaker 4>I'll take the heat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a libertarian,</v>

1412
01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:44.973
<v Speaker 4>so if somebody says I'm fat and unhappy </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I liked my life and I know what the </v>

1413
01:06:49.571 --> 01:06:52.060
<v Speaker 4>risks are that I say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>knock yourself out.</v>

1414
01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:55.180
<v Speaker 4>I've ended up before the judge will make</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody else happy.</v>

1415
01:06:55.181 --> 01:06:57.850
<v Speaker 4>But now the problem is if you complained</v>
<v Speaker 4>about being fat,</v>

1416
01:06:57.940 --> 01:06:58.773
<v Speaker 4>that you got to do something about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>otherwise you're not going to have any </v>

1417
01:07:00.881 --> 01:07:01.420
<v Speaker 4>patients for.</v>

1418
01:07:01.420 --> 01:07:04.450
<v Speaker 4>That goes back to the discipline there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can be fit,</v>

1419
01:07:04.510 --> 01:07:08.110
<v Speaker 4>but fat that you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because you have morbidly obese people.</v>

1420
01:07:08.111 --> 01:07:08.944
<v Speaker 4>Like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you lose 10 percent of your body </v>

1421
01:07:09.851 --> 01:07:10.684
<v Speaker 4>weight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's overweight people who run </v>

1422
01:07:11.891 --> 01:07:13.780
<v Speaker 4>marathons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Texture.</v>

1423
01:07:13.980 --> 01:07:15.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't tell me they're not in shape.</v>

1424
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:16.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1425
01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:17.473
<v Speaker 4>know for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just you're just carrying extra </v>

1426
01:07:18.671 --> 01:07:19.391
<v Speaker 4>weight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1427
01:07:19.391 --> 01:07:21.790
<v Speaker 4>look at Daniel Cormier.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not obese.</v>

1428
01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:24.220
<v Speaker 4>He's not obese,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he has some fat.</v>

1429
01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:28.240
<v Speaker 4>Don't come get me down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought steep meo chick.</v>

1430
01:07:28.390 --> 01:07:29.223
<v Speaker 4>He was more than 40 pounds over his </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting weight as a light heavyweight </v>

1431
01:07:32.591 --> 01:07:33.424
<v Speaker 4>champion and he was actually heavier </v>
<v Speaker 4>than steep a bay and serves the </v>

1432
01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:39.540
<v Speaker 4>practical friend of mine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

1433
01:07:39.570 --> 01:07:43.180
<v Speaker 4>but that is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The performance is not the same thing as</v>

1434
01:07:43.181 --> 01:07:44.014
<v Speaker 4>aesthetics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me tell you what it meant to shape </v>

1435
01:07:45.010 --> 01:07:46.900
<v Speaker 4>what I looked like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That I looked amazing.</v>

1436
01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:49.660
<v Speaker 4>You felt like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I felt like shit ready to pass out.</v>

1437
01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:51.033
<v Speaker 4>Literally for me to stand up was a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>was I remember being on the couch and </v>

1438
01:07:54.251 --> 01:07:59.251
<v Speaker 4>there was a stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some show on [inaudible] dot com.</v>

1439
01:07:59.550 --> 01:08:00.383
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was a stupid show on TV and the </v>

1440
01:08:02.501 --> 01:08:04.510
<v Speaker 4>remote was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this goes back to neat.</v>

1441
01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:07.510
<v Speaker 4>There was a remote over there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like five feet away.</v>

1442
01:08:08.170 --> 01:08:09.003
<v Speaker 4>I sat and watched the whole show because</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just didn't feel like getting the </v>

1443
01:08:10.451 --> 01:08:11.284
<v Speaker 4>fucking remote.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So isn't it ironic because you look so </v>

1444
01:08:14.411 --> 01:08:15.980
<v Speaker 4>good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when you jacked</v>

1445
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:16.813
<v Speaker 2>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look like you just fucking running </v>

1446
01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:21.320
<v Speaker 2>forever breakthrough walls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now there is a threshold,</v>

1447
01:08:21.321 --> 01:08:22.154
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the Ray Williams who is the </v>

1448
01:08:23.811 --> 01:08:26.960
<v Speaker 2>world's best power lifter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he looks obese,</v>

1449
01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:28.093
<v Speaker 2>dude squats legit 180 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that an issue there with power </v>

1450
01:08:31.701 --> 01:08:32.534
<v Speaker 2>lifter?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a good percentage of them carrying </v>

1451
01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:35.143
<v Speaker 2>around a lot of body fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not as much as you would think </v>

1452
01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:40.130
<v Speaker 2>anymore like in the super heavyweight ts</v>
<v Speaker 2>because like for example,</v>

1453
01:08:40.131 --> 01:08:40.964
<v Speaker 2>the IPF,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of the IOC recognized </v>

1454
01:08:42.711 --> 01:08:43.544
<v Speaker 2>Power Lifting Federation that I compete </v>
<v Speaker 2>in their cutoff for super heavy weights </v>

1455
01:08:46.881 --> 01:08:47.714
<v Speaker 2>to 65.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're going to be a super </v>

1456
01:08:48.801 --> 01:08:51.200
<v Speaker 2>heavyweight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>might as well just be 3:50,</v>

1457
01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:52.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was that Dude Jamie,</v>

1458
01:08:53.580 --> 01:08:57.320
<v Speaker 2>that's ray as bets re re look at the bar</v>
<v Speaker 2>bending.</v>

1459
01:08:57.380 --> 01:08:58.370
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1460
01:08:58.520 --> 01:08:59.970
<v Speaker 2>he's a beast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a beast,</v>

1461
01:09:00.170 --> 01:09:01.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gentlemen,</v>

1462
01:09:01.250 --> 01:09:03.230
<v Speaker 2>Super Nice Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a blind sumner,</v>

1463
01:09:03.231 --> 01:09:03.650
<v Speaker 2>another one.</v>

1464
01:09:03.650 --> 01:09:07.600
<v Speaker 2>But like when I sit my squat record of </v>
<v Speaker 2>six 68 at 200,</v>

1465
01:09:07.601 --> 01:09:08.434
<v Speaker 2>five pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was in pretty good shape for </v>

1466
01:09:10.041 --> 01:09:10.874
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for me to get to like eight percent </v>

1467
01:09:12.621 --> 01:09:13.454
<v Speaker 2>body fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no problem for me to get from eight </v>

1468
01:09:15.201 --> 01:09:16.034
<v Speaker 2>percent and I'm calibrating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for me to get to from eight percent </v>

1469
01:09:19.341 --> 01:09:22.690
<v Speaker 2>to three percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so fucking nightmare your body again.</v>

1470
01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:27.140
<v Speaker 2>Really get down to three on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that would be if you floated.</v>

1471
01:09:27.390 --> 01:09:29.120
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are no actual,</v>

1472
01:09:29.330 --> 01:09:31.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>accurate measures of body fat.</v>

1473
01:09:31.251 --> 01:09:32.084
<v Speaker 2>That's the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why it's not really like the </v>

1474
01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:34.873
<v Speaker 2>relatively within themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're activists dependent upon </v>

1475
01:09:36.801 --> 01:09:39.290
<v Speaker 2>hydration factors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1476
01:09:39.291 --> 01:09:41.810
<v Speaker 2>So people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not to make too much of a side tangent,</v>

1477
01:09:41.811 --> 01:09:46.250
<v Speaker 2>but people look at Dexa dual x Ray </v>
<v Speaker 2>absorption technology and they say,</v>

1478
01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:47.420
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the gold standard.</v>

1479
01:09:47.810 --> 01:09:51.700
<v Speaker 2>Texas actually really finicky.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I remember Dec,</v>

1480
01:09:51.701 --> 01:09:54.740
<v Speaker 2>seeing rats in studies that we do it in </v>
<v Speaker 2>duplicate,</v>

1481
01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:56.053
<v Speaker 2>so we do it twice and sometimes you'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>have like differences just decorating </v>

1482
01:09:59.510 --> 01:10:00.620
<v Speaker 2>the same rat twice.</v>

1483
01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:02.990
<v Speaker 2>It depends on the machine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your hydration status,</v>

1484
01:10:02.991 --> 01:10:04.490
<v Speaker 2>because water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to gain,</v>

1485
01:10:04.550 --> 01:10:05.383
<v Speaker 2>you know what the best way to gain eight</v>
<v Speaker 2>pounds of lean body mass within five </v>

1486
01:10:08.751 --> 01:10:10.490
<v Speaker 2>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go do a Dexa,</v>

1487
01:10:10.550 --> 01:10:12.320
<v Speaker 2>then drink a gallon of water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go back to the next,</v>

1488
01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:13.670
<v Speaker 2>another Dexa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll be eight pounds.</v>

1489
01:10:13.671 --> 01:10:14.504
<v Speaker 2>Lean body mass heavier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can impress your friends because </v>

1490
01:10:15.981 --> 01:10:17.830
<v Speaker 2>it's the two compartment model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More lean body mass.</v>

1491
01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:20.000
<v Speaker 2>It's a to compartment model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Same thing with calipers.</v>

1492
01:10:20.001 --> 01:10:22.220
<v Speaker 2>It's only measuring your amount of fat </v>
<v Speaker 2>tissue.</v>

1493
01:10:22.430 --> 01:10:25.130
<v Speaker 2>So anything that's not fat is lean body </v>
<v Speaker 2>mass.</v>

1494
01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:27.710
<v Speaker 2>So if you guys are using that to track </v>
<v Speaker 2>progress,</v>

1495
01:10:27.711 --> 01:10:28.544
<v Speaker 2>if anybody use that to track progress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's only accurate relative to the </v>

1496
01:10:32.991 --> 01:10:33.824
<v Speaker 2>measurement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your calipers me nothing for what </v>

1497
01:10:35.721 --> 01:10:37.840
<v Speaker 2>your dexa measurements going to be and </v>
<v Speaker 2>vice versa.</v>

1498
01:10:37.890 --> 01:10:39.830
<v Speaker 2>I see it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the change,</v>

1499
01:10:39.831 --> 01:10:40.664
<v Speaker 2>like if I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I'm calibrating a consistently at 10 </v>

1500
01:10:44.151 --> 01:10:44.984
<v Speaker 2>percent and then it drops to eight and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then seven and I can be relatively </v>

1501
01:10:47.751 --> 01:10:50.270
<v Speaker 2>confident that I'm losing body fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing for Dexa,</v>

1502
01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:52.190
<v Speaker 2>but you have to do it at the same time </v>
<v Speaker 2>of day,</v>

1503
01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:54.830
<v Speaker 2>same hydration status,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of that kind of stuff.</v>

1504
01:10:55.250 --> 01:10:57.530
<v Speaker 2>And I don't really use dexhub because </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

1505
01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:58.753
<v Speaker 2>in order to get an accurate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd have to use it like every day for </v>

1506
01:11:01.461 --> 01:11:03.920
<v Speaker 2>it to be actual relative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You use pictures,</v>

1507
01:11:03.921 --> 01:11:04.754
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when he was dying and got to a </v>

1508
01:11:05.991 --> 01:11:08.780
<v Speaker 2>certain way off tangent here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I looked at him as,</v>

1509
01:11:08.781 --> 01:11:09.470
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1510
01:11:09.470 --> 01:11:13.290
<v Speaker 2>like stop there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then he would go for another and get</v>

1511
01:11:13.291 --> 01:11:14.124
<v Speaker 2>to a level where</v>

1512
01:11:14.190 --> 01:11:15.780
<v Speaker 4>he looked very gaunt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1513
01:11:15.781 --> 01:11:19.530
<v Speaker 4>you looked what looks good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like seeing him in person.</v>

1514
01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:22.470
<v Speaker 4>Like I need this personality was </v>
<v Speaker 4>changing.</v>

1515
01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:23.910
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of Freaky,</v>

1516
01:11:23.911 --> 01:11:25.650
<v Speaker 4>disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Looking towards the end,</v>

1517
01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:27.053
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and many people who maybe follow the </v>

1518
01:11:28.321 --> 01:11:31.290
<v Speaker 4>sport but don't compete,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't really realize what the difference</v>

1519
01:11:31.291 --> 01:11:34.380
<v Speaker 4>between five percent or six percent and </v>
<v Speaker 4>three percent is.</v>

1520
01:11:34.670 --> 01:11:37.590
<v Speaker 4>So that separates the competitors from </v>
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>

1521
01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:38.753
<v Speaker 4>That's your Bros online.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really fighting evolution at that point </v>

1522
01:11:41.310 --> 01:11:43.710
<v Speaker 4>because your body is trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your close to starvation,</v>

1523
01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:46.110
<v Speaker 4>literally your body is trying to keep </v>
<v Speaker 4>you from doing that,</v>

1524
01:11:46.500 --> 01:11:48.240
<v Speaker 4>so like you think about food all the </v>
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>

1525
01:11:48.241 --> 01:11:50.280
<v Speaker 4>you actually become.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a friend of mine,</v>

1526
01:11:50.490 --> 01:11:53.130
<v Speaker 4>Chris Foster,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a professor at l a.</v>

1527
01:11:53.290 --> 01:11:56.820
<v Speaker 4>He was doing his phd at the same time as</v>
<v Speaker 4>me and him.</v>

1528
01:11:56.880 --> 01:12:00.060
<v Speaker 4>My other friend Dr Jeremy Lin and Dr </v>
<v Speaker 4>Lindy Russo,</v>

1529
01:12:00.300 --> 01:12:03.030
<v Speaker 4>Chris's wife Chris was doing a contest </v>
<v Speaker 4>prep,</v>

1530
01:12:03.031 --> 01:12:07.560
<v Speaker 4>but I prepped him for the show and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>was a six months study of He's a natural</v>

1531
01:12:07.570 --> 01:12:08.403
<v Speaker 4>bodybuilder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so drug free and they looked at the </v>

1532
01:12:10.171 --> 01:12:12.000
<v Speaker 4>hormonal responses,</v>
<v Speaker 4>his weight,</v>

1533
01:12:12.001 --> 01:12:15.060
<v Speaker 4>his body fat and even like measures of </v>
<v Speaker 4>mood.</v>

1534
01:12:15.450 --> 01:12:16.283
<v Speaker 4>Chris is like the most.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was a beast like to 60 or I'm not a </v>

1535
01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:22.260
<v Speaker 4>natural joy free by 2:20</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the off season,</v>

1536
01:12:22.261 --> 01:12:25.220
<v Speaker 4>but one day he just looked like he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1537
01:12:25.221 --> 01:12:26.054
<v Speaker 4>he's a big guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he's like a very mellow dude by the </v>

1538
01:12:28.650 --> 01:12:29.530
<v Speaker 4>end.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His mood measurements.</v>

1539
01:12:29.531 --> 01:12:31.080
<v Speaker 4>We're measuring like that of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychopath.</v>

1540
01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:32.290
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1541
01:12:32.330 --> 01:12:37.330
<v Speaker 4>It just changes your mood around </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighters who like they get when they get</v>

1542
01:12:37.351 --> 01:12:38.184
<v Speaker 4>that lean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just like he could barely talk to </v>

1543
01:12:39.631 --> 01:12:43.260
<v Speaker 4>you and we'll think about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think about like they're actually trying</v>

1544
01:12:43.261 --> 01:12:45.930
<v Speaker 4>to peak for a fight at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They feel the most like shit.</v>

1545
01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:46.793
<v Speaker 4>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're so focused on cardio they want </v>

1546
01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:50.120
<v Speaker 4>to make to send to a.</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're.</v>

1547
01:12:50.130 --> 01:12:53.120
<v Speaker 4>They're focused on just dehydration and </v>
<v Speaker 4>making that way.</v>

1548
01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:55.370
<v Speaker 4>I've seen some of the protocols.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've.</v>

1549
01:12:55.470 --> 01:12:56.303
<v Speaker 4>There's some good ones out there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but some of the stuff I've seen them </v>

1550
01:12:57.510 --> 01:12:58.021
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>God,</v>

1551
01:12:58.021 --> 01:13:01.830
<v Speaker 4>I wish I could talk to somebody in that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in that realm because it's so.</v>

1552
01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:03.210
<v Speaker 4>It's so much bro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Science,</v>

1553
01:13:03.211 --> 01:13:04.610
<v Speaker 4>it's so dangerous to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's.</v>

1554
01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:05.473
<v Speaker 4>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can only do it three or four times </v>

1555
01:13:06.841 --> 01:13:09.690
<v Speaker 4>and then your body starts to reject it </v>
<v Speaker 4>and these guys have to go up and wait.</v>

1556
01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:10.720
<v Speaker 4>Like you were talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1557
01:13:10.721 --> 01:13:11.860
<v Speaker 4>you explained to you why.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1558
01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:12.881
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Guess what?</v>

1559
01:13:12.881 --> 01:13:15.780
<v Speaker 4>What happens when they go up a weight?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes they start crushing it.</v>

1560
01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:19.770
<v Speaker 4>Do they do much better?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's testosterone right?</v>

1561
01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:21.780
<v Speaker 4>At plummeted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but his,</v>

1562
01:13:21.810 --> 01:13:25.720
<v Speaker 4>his bazell requirements as calories </v>
<v Speaker 4>department was like 1200.</v>

1563
01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:28.140
<v Speaker 4>The crazy thing is I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1564
01:13:28.141 --> 01:13:28.974
<v Speaker 4>there had been some critics of my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my kind of a view of metabolic </v>

1565
01:13:32.131 --> 01:13:33.900
<v Speaker 4>adaptation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The body is self defense system,</v>

1566
01:13:33.901 --> 01:13:36.210
<v Speaker 4>full full disclosure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people criticized me about that.</v>

1567
01:13:36.211 --> 01:13:37.230
<v Speaker 4>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1568
01:13:37.231 --> 01:13:38.064
<v Speaker 4>if you look at metabolic adaptation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it only explains it's only a 15 percent </v>

1569
01:13:41.041 --> 01:13:44.010
<v Speaker 4>adaptation relative to the whole </v>
<v Speaker 4>adaptation.</v>

1570
01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:47.010
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you look at Chris's numbers,</v>

1571
01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:47.993
<v Speaker 4>I think on average that's probably right</v>
<v Speaker 4>on an average diet with an average </v>

1572
01:13:50.131 --> 01:13:50.964
<v Speaker 4>person you take,</v>
<v Speaker 4>somebody's trying to get really lean or </v>

1573
01:13:52.501 --> 01:13:54.870
<v Speaker 4>somebody who jojo diets or somebody </v>
<v Speaker 4>crash diets.</v>

1574
01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:57.450
<v Speaker 4>And now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if again,</v>

1575
01:13:57.570 --> 01:13:58.403
<v Speaker 4>it's proportionate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you challenge your body with </v>

1576
01:14:00.211 --> 01:14:01.044
<v Speaker 4>something extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to respond in an extreme </v>

1577
01:14:02.401 --> 01:14:03.234
<v Speaker 4>fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So every case study we have on natural </v>

1578
01:14:05.701 --> 01:14:06.534
<v Speaker 4>bodybuilders and there's about 10 of </v>
<v Speaker 4>them now who look at their contest </v>

1579
01:14:09.061 --> 01:14:09.894
<v Speaker 4>preparation and coming out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I use them to just because this is </v>

1580
01:14:11.591 --> 01:14:12.130
<v Speaker 4>the realm I grew</v>

1581
01:14:12.130 --> 01:14:12.963
<v Speaker 2>up in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shows that they're hypogonadal by the </v>

1582
01:14:15.161 --> 01:14:15.994
<v Speaker 2>time that they're at stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So hypogonadal meaning their </v>

1583
01:14:19.330 --> 01:14:21.340
<v Speaker 2>testosterone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their testosterone is clinically low.</v>

1584
01:14:21.610 --> 01:14:22.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>naturally.</v>

1585
01:14:23.020 --> 01:14:24.800
<v Speaker 2>And these are guys like me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I actually run.</v>

1586
01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:27.940
<v Speaker 2>I actually have a pretty naturally high </v>
<v Speaker 2>testosterone level.</v>

1587
01:14:27.941 --> 01:14:30.310
<v Speaker 2>Like when every.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time ever since I'm 16 years old,</v>

1588
01:14:30.311 --> 01:14:32.820
<v Speaker 2>when I got tested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been like over 800.</v>

1589
01:14:33.010 --> 01:14:35.380
<v Speaker 2>If I'm eating enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I was at contest,</v>

1590
01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:36.453
<v Speaker 2>I was under 300.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is part of how your body fights </v>

1591
01:14:39.161 --> 01:14:39.994
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your body does not want you to be that </v>

1592
01:14:40.901 --> 01:14:41.734
<v Speaker 2>lean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're kind of raining this back </v>

1593
01:14:44.711 --> 01:14:45.544
<v Speaker 2>into the discussion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is why I talk about why it's so </v>

1594
01:14:47.741 --> 01:14:50.920
<v Speaker 2>important to pick something that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>sustainable for you as an individual.</v>

1595
01:14:51.190 --> 01:14:52.023
<v Speaker 2>Because if you do this shit where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>Yoyo Diet or you don't come out of it </v>

1596
01:14:55.331 --> 01:14:57.850
<v Speaker 2>appropriately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it will fuck you up.</v>

1597
01:14:57.970 --> 01:14:58.720
<v Speaker 2>I mean we've.</v>

1598
01:14:58.720 --> 01:15:02.440
<v Speaker 2>We've all females,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in a lot of track record,</v>

1599
01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:03.293
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've worked with a lot of females now </v>

1600
01:15:04.721 --> 01:15:05.554
<v Speaker 2>because especially in physique sports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of really bad coaching </v>

1601
01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:10.800
<v Speaker 2>starvation diets than for women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1602
01:15:10.810 --> 01:15:14.010
<v Speaker 2>it just messes with their reproductive </v>
<v Speaker 2>cycle to stop having peer mentors,</v>

1603
01:15:15.370 --> 01:15:16.203
<v Speaker 2>which I'm going to and of itself doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>seem to have necessarily what does that </v>

1604
01:15:19.380 --> 01:15:23.140
<v Speaker 2>no menstrual cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it doesn't necessarily end of itself,</v>

1605
01:15:23.141 --> 01:15:24.670
<v Speaker 2>seemed to be a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1606
01:15:25.660 --> 01:15:26.493
<v Speaker 2>have negative health consequences in </v>
<v Speaker 2>terms of longevity or disease or </v>

1607
01:15:28.751 --> 01:15:30.580
<v Speaker 2>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

1608
01:15:30.581 --> 01:15:33.820
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you can't get pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's a big deal for some women,</v>

1609
01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:34.863
<v Speaker 2>but the women don't want to hear is you </v>
<v Speaker 2>may have to gain some body fat to get </v>

1610
01:15:37.511 --> 01:15:38.680
<v Speaker 2>that back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1611
01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:41.680
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is why,</v>

1612
01:15:41.710 --> 01:15:46.450
<v Speaker 2>like I really start with sustainability </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then from there I go to,</v>

1613
01:15:46.510 --> 01:15:48.280
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

1614
01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:50.110
<v Speaker 2>So if we've got what's sustainable for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you now,</v>

1615
01:15:50.111 --> 01:15:52.180
<v Speaker 2>can we get a little bit better?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we do a little bit more fiber?</v>

1616
01:15:52.650 --> 01:15:54.940
<v Speaker 2>Like I think in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1617
01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:56.133
<v Speaker 2>I criticize Paleo diets because I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>their validation for their model is </v>

1618
01:15:59.381 --> 01:16:02.560
<v Speaker 2>absolutely fucking stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1619
01:16:02.590 --> 01:16:03.423
<v Speaker 2>the kind of evolutionary validation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that we didn't drink milk and </v>

1620
01:16:06.461 --> 01:16:08.500
<v Speaker 2>we didn't eat beans in this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

1621
01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:10.053
<v Speaker 2>but coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the question shouldn't be what we </v>

1622
01:16:12.221 --> 01:16:13.054
<v Speaker 2>were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question should be what makes sense </v>

1623
01:16:15.131 --> 01:16:17.950
<v Speaker 2>and what is healthy now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you look at studies on dairy,</v>

1624
01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:23.230
<v Speaker 2>almost all studies show people who take </v>
<v Speaker 2>in dairy are healthier,</v>

1625
01:16:23.290 --> 01:16:25.360
<v Speaker 2>better bone density,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more lean body mass,</v>

1626
01:16:25.361 --> 01:16:26.670
<v Speaker 2>lower body fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it isn't.</v>

1627
01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:28.750
<v Speaker 2>Are there a lot of people that think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that dairy is bad for you?</v>

1628
01:16:28.950 --> 01:16:30.370
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here it causes inflammation.</v>

1629
01:16:30.610 --> 01:16:32.190
<v Speaker 2>Megan's but early,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1630
01:16:32.270 --> 01:16:33.010
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

1631
01:16:33.010 --> 01:16:33.843
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some like clean eaters to think that </v>

1632
01:16:35.471 --> 01:16:37.530
<v Speaker 2>dairy somehow causes the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the research data.</v>

1633
01:16:38.410 --> 01:16:39.243
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1634
01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:41.800
<v Speaker 3>In dairy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1635
01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:42.713
<v Speaker 3>various proteins that a alpha locked </v>
<v Speaker 3>albumin or that can basically initiate </v>

1636
01:16:48.240 --> 01:16:50.130
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an immune response in the body.</v>

1637
01:16:50.220 --> 01:16:51.053
<v Speaker 3>So I know when I'm okay with dairy fat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can get like 100 grams a day of dairy </v>

1638
01:16:54.781 --> 01:16:55.800
<v Speaker 3>fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if I'm,</v>

1639
01:16:55.860 --> 01:16:56.693
<v Speaker 3>if I drink a whey protein shake,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially at night I wake up all </v>

1640
01:16:58.831 --> 01:17:03.831
<v Speaker 3>congested and pure whey concentrate a </v>
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>

1641
01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:07.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>way concentrated or just like a,</v>

1642
01:17:08.110 --> 01:17:09.920
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a yogurt or,</v>

1643
01:17:10.210 --> 01:17:12.170
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think it's a spectrum,</v>

1644
01:17:12.171 --> 01:17:13.004
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's not like you have it or you </v>

1645
01:17:14.151 --> 01:17:14.990
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1646
01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:19.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a spectrum and bovine protein is</v>

1647
01:17:19.731 --> 01:17:24.400
<v Speaker 3>kind of viewed a foreign body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean once it enters the bloodstream it</v>

1648
01:17:24.410 --> 01:17:25.243
<v Speaker 3>can.</v>

1649
01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:26.153
<v Speaker 2>It's only if it enters the blood stream </v>
<v Speaker 2>because if digestion is working </v>

1650
01:17:28.901 --> 01:17:29.734
<v Speaker 2>properly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to get any of that in </v>

1651
01:17:30.791 --> 01:17:33.080
<v Speaker 2>the bloodstream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all going to be chewed up into some</v>

1652
01:17:33.081 --> 01:17:35.110
<v Speaker 2>of the die and try peptides.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of it makes,</v>

1653
01:17:35.111 --> 01:17:36.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean like insulins have 15,</v>

1654
01:17:36.670 --> 01:17:38.950
<v Speaker 3>the amino acid and if you take enough </v>
<v Speaker 3>insulin,</v>

1655
01:17:38.980 --> 01:17:42.310
<v Speaker 3>like you can basically go hypoglycemic </v>
<v Speaker 3>if you orally consume it.</v>

1656
01:17:42.311 --> 01:17:43.440
<v Speaker 3>That's why you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I</v>

1657
01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:45.400
<v Speaker 2>think it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's 81,</v>

1658
01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.640
<v Speaker 2>81 I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh well it doesn't matter.</v>

1659
01:17:47.690 --> 01:17:49.000
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1660
01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:50.230
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1661
01:17:50.231 --> 01:17:55.231
<v Speaker 2>So even something that's a 50 amino </v>
<v Speaker 2>acids can get through this,</v>

1662
01:17:56.321 --> 01:18:00.590
<v Speaker 2>this term lactose intolerance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that's actually resigning?</v>

1663
01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:02.250
<v Speaker 2>That's actually sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1664
01:18:02.350 --> 01:18:06.030
<v Speaker 2>So this is an issue with people's </v>
<v Speaker 2>individual dietary system.</v>

1665
01:18:06.060 --> 01:18:06.893
<v Speaker 2>Some people have a alpha elect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>albumin sensitive sensitivity where </v>

1666
01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:13.990
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they've got some kind of leaky gut.</v>

1667
01:18:14.050 --> 01:18:15.580
<v Speaker 2>So normally your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

1668
01:18:15.790 --> 01:18:17.830
<v Speaker 2>your injunctions are tight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1669
01:18:17.831 --> 01:18:19.210
<v Speaker 2>So your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your small intestine,</v>

1670
01:18:19.260 --> 01:18:22.000
<v Speaker 2>your intestines are like kind of fingers</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they pick up nutrients.</v>

1671
01:18:22.001 --> 01:18:23.890
<v Speaker 2>This I'm really generalizing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but theo cells,</v>

1672
01:18:23.891 --> 01:18:27.890
<v Speaker 2>the tight junction is a little little </v>
<v Speaker 2>anchor that holds that gets loose,</v>

1673
01:18:28.180 --> 01:18:29.013
<v Speaker 2>dysfunctional with that that can allow </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain nutrients through the wall and </v>

1674
01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:35.890
<v Speaker 2>that will initiate a bodies in loon </v>
<v Speaker 2>response.</v>

1675
01:18:35.891 --> 01:18:40.891
<v Speaker 2>Holly is a CELIAC and she.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if she has gluten it you will know it</v>

1676
01:18:41.830 --> 01:18:44.170
<v Speaker 2>because she will have a huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammatory response.</v>

1677
01:18:44.170 --> 01:18:46.690
<v Speaker 2>But in people who have normal digestion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just doesn't happen.</v>

1678
01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:48.213
<v Speaker 2>Going back to the Paleo thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I was going to say is even though </v>

1679
01:18:51.071 --> 01:18:53.710
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I disagree with their relevance,</v>

1680
01:18:53.711 --> 01:18:55.780
<v Speaker 2>if you told me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1681
01:18:55.781 --> 01:18:59.350
<v Speaker 2>you take their general recommendations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat limit sugar,</v>

1682
01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:01.900
<v Speaker 2>eat more whole foods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat higher protein.</v>

1683
01:19:01.901 --> 01:19:05.170
<v Speaker 2>I think in general that's pretty good </v>
<v Speaker 2>recommendations for most people.</v>

1684
01:19:05.530 --> 01:19:06.700
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you said,</v>

1685
01:19:06.701 --> 01:19:07.534
<v Speaker 2>I'm anti bullshit so I'm not going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>let you make claims about why something </v>

1686
01:19:11.321 --> 01:19:12.154
<v Speaker 2>works when that's not why it works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when we look at like the differences </v>

1687
01:19:16.661 --> 01:19:17.494
<v Speaker 2>in diets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I think what I would say generally </v>

1688
01:19:19.331 --> 01:19:20.164
<v Speaker 2>to pr people is that here's the great </v>
<v Speaker 2>news as far as fat loss goes and health </v>

1689
01:19:25.211 --> 01:19:27.880
<v Speaker 2>markers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to lose weight,</v>

1690
01:19:28.990 --> 01:19:31.090
<v Speaker 2>if you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you control your calories,</v>

1691
01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:31.953
<v Speaker 2>so a calorie deficit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you eat enough protein because protein </v>

1692
01:19:34.631 --> 01:19:35.464
<v Speaker 2>helps spare lean body mass and is </v>
<v Speaker 2>thermogenic so it increases your energy </v>

1693
01:19:38.501 --> 01:19:39.334
<v Speaker 2>output and then you can kind of do </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever you want with carbs and fats </v>

1694
01:19:43.451 --> 01:19:44.284
<v Speaker 2>and whatever you prefer and you'll still</v>
<v Speaker 2>lose the same amount of weight and get </v>

1695
01:19:46.121 --> 01:19:48.310
<v Speaker 2>about all the health benefits.</v>

1696
01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:52.270
<v Speaker 2>But it has to be something that you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>sustain because if you can't sustain it,</v>

1697
01:19:52.271 --> 01:19:53.740
<v Speaker 2>you're going to put all that weight back</v>
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>

1698
01:19:53.950 --> 01:19:58.210
<v Speaker 2>That's what the research data shows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So donald loves sustaining it,</v>

1699
01:19:58.211 --> 01:20:01.930
<v Speaker 2>meaning for life balanced diet that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could stick with versus for life,</v>

1700
01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:02.793
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a calorie deficit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's really only a temporary thing to </v>

1701
01:20:04.991 --> 01:20:05.890
<v Speaker 2>lose weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1702
01:20:05.891 --> 01:20:08.640
<v Speaker 2>So now obviously you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't eat a deficit forever,</v>

1703
01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:09.533
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because then you would starve yourself </v>

1704
01:20:10.081 --> 01:20:12.780
<v Speaker 2>to death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the body corrects that.</v>

1705
01:20:12.810 --> 01:20:14.660
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you drop body weight,</v>

1706
01:20:14.670 --> 01:20:15.503
<v Speaker 2>your metabolic rate slows down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not in a calorie deficit forever </v>

1707
01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:20.790
<v Speaker 2>when we talk about losing weight and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then maintaining it,</v>

1708
01:20:20.910 --> 01:20:22.770
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So eating in a maintenance,</v>

1709
01:20:23.130 --> 01:20:28.130
<v Speaker 2>so eating basically the behaviors you </v>
<v Speaker 2>use in the style of dieting you use,</v>

1710
01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:31.770
<v Speaker 2>you have to continue that if you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>maintain it.</v>

1711
01:20:31.771 --> 01:20:34.290
<v Speaker 2>So if you like key to Janet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you like key to genic,</v>

1712
01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:38.820
<v Speaker 2>you liked you to genic mo and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a big fan of meat.</v>

1713
01:20:40.020 --> 01:20:41.880
<v Speaker 2>If you can sustain that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1714
01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:43.350
<v Speaker 2>like people out there as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

1715
01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:44.273
<v Speaker 2>people will probably tell you you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to get cancer and you're going to </v>

1716
01:20:45.331 --> 01:20:46.164
<v Speaker 2>do this and you're gonna do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of those health benefits are just </v>

1717
01:20:48.841 --> 01:20:53.070
<v Speaker 2>from not having excess body fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>excess body fat,</v>

1718
01:20:53.071 --> 01:20:57.000
<v Speaker 2>and the metabolic dysregulation of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>metabolic type syndrome.</v>

1719
01:20:57.570 --> 01:21:00.570
<v Speaker 2>That's what cause 90 percent of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems.</v>

1720
01:21:00.990 --> 01:21:02.190
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

1721
01:21:02.191 --> 01:21:05.910
<v Speaker 2>which is why I get crazy when people say</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fat is healthy.</v>

1722
01:21:06.510 --> 01:21:07.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well here's the problem.</v>

1723
01:21:07.891 --> 01:21:09.930
<v Speaker 2>It's like we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have like reactionary culture.</v>

1724
01:21:10.230 --> 01:21:14.520
<v Speaker 2>So we have been through your set point </v>
<v Speaker 2>is to we have reactionary culture,</v>

1725
01:21:14.580 --> 01:21:17.700
<v Speaker 2>so you see this all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we had,</v>

1726
01:21:17.910 --> 01:21:20.130
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to eliminate saturated fat,</v>

1727
01:21:20.131 --> 01:21:20.964
<v Speaker 2>you gotta eliminate dietary fat and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat grains and limit your proteins and </v>

1728
01:21:25.921 --> 01:21:29.250
<v Speaker 2>we got fatter and so the reaction to </v>
<v Speaker 2>that was don't eat any carbs.</v>

1729
01:21:29.610 --> 01:21:31.710
<v Speaker 2>Saturated fat isn't bad for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

1730
01:21:31.711 --> 01:21:34.050
<v Speaker 2>eat as much saturated fat as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>

1731
01:21:34.051 --> 01:21:34.884
<v Speaker 2>Put butter in your coffee like no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's good data to show that the </v>

1732
01:21:39.901 --> 01:21:40.734
<v Speaker 2>research data that I've seen in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>opinion shows that saturated fat </v>

1733
01:21:43.831 --> 01:21:46.950
<v Speaker 2>absolutely was demonized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not as bad as we thought,</v>

1734
01:21:47.790 --> 01:21:51.150
<v Speaker 2>but it's if you eat too much of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not great either,</v>

1735
01:21:51.300 --> 01:21:54.030
<v Speaker 2>especially with carbohydrates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh absolutely.</v>

1736
01:21:54.450 --> 01:21:55.283
<v Speaker 2>Because now you're increasing your.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you're increasing your liver </v>

1737
01:21:56.881 --> 01:21:59.210
<v Speaker 2>production of saturated fats as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1738
01:21:59.260 --> 01:22:01.080
<v Speaker 2>When your body gets into a fat burning </v>
<v Speaker 2>stage,</v>

1739
01:22:01.081 --> 01:22:03.900
<v Speaker 2>and then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you pile on carbohydrates,</v>

1740
01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:06.030
<v Speaker 2>then your body wants to store those </v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates.</v>

1741
01:22:06.031 --> 01:22:06.864
<v Speaker 2>As with the Calorie surplus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you actually technically you store the </v>

1742
01:22:10.411 --> 01:22:12.930
<v Speaker 2>fats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you started because you carbohydrate,</v>

1743
01:22:13.020 --> 01:22:14.640
<v Speaker 2>you burn the carbohydrates stored,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1744
01:22:14.710 --> 01:22:16.890
<v Speaker 2>So carbohydrate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you say,</v>

1745
01:22:16.891 --> 01:22:17.491
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why does,</v>

1746
01:22:17.491 --> 01:22:18.324
<v Speaker 2>if you don't store Kobo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I talk about this in my book because </v>

1747
01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:22.950
<v Speaker 2>people will go too far to each direction</v>
<v Speaker 2>to say,</v>

1748
01:22:22.951 --> 01:22:23.820
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you said you don't.</v>

1749
01:22:23.990 --> 01:22:27.120
<v Speaker 2>You only use you hardly story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any carbohydrate is actual fat.</v>

1750
01:22:27.630 --> 01:22:30.870
<v Speaker 2>Why don't we eat zero fat and mostly </v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrates?</v>

1751
01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:34.260
<v Speaker 2>Well then your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body's not dumb,</v>

1752
01:22:34.350 --> 01:22:35.280
<v Speaker 2>your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we didn't.</v>

1753
01:22:35.490 --> 01:22:36.323
<v Speaker 2>You didn't get here today and get </v>
<v Speaker 2>through evolution in tens of thousand </v>

1754
01:22:39.031 --> 01:22:40.610
<v Speaker 2>years of hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1755
01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:41.453
<v Speaker 2>living by your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being stupid so your body can ramp up </v>

1756
01:22:44.911 --> 01:22:45.744
<v Speaker 2>Denovo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lipogenesis so that you can create fat </v>

1757
01:22:48.750 --> 01:22:51.540
<v Speaker 2>from carbohydrate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If fat gets low in carbohydrate intake,</v>

1758
01:22:51.541 --> 01:22:53.170
<v Speaker 2>gets high enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Essential fatty acid.</v>

1759
01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:57.360
<v Speaker 2>There was a research study or a med </v>
<v Speaker 2>analysis done by Kevin Hall,</v>

1760
01:22:57.361 --> 01:22:58.194
<v Speaker 2>who's an Nih researcher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they showed that if you equate </v>

1761
01:23:02.791 --> 01:23:03.624
<v Speaker 2>calories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get a extra benefit from fat </v>

1762
01:23:07.631 --> 01:23:09.910
<v Speaker 2>restriction versus carb restriction on </v>
<v Speaker 2>fat loss.</v>

1763
01:23:09.970 --> 01:23:12.970
<v Speaker 2>So you get about 26 grams extra fat loss</v>
<v Speaker 2>per day.</v>

1764
01:23:13.210 --> 01:23:17.830
<v Speaker 2>Calories equated a protein acquainted if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you restrict fat versus carp.</v>

1765
01:23:17.950 --> 01:23:18.783
<v Speaker 2>Now before everybody goes crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably due to a little bit of </v>

1766
01:23:22.150 --> 01:23:26.110
<v Speaker 2>inefficiencies in ramping up Denovo </v>
<v Speaker 2>lipogenesis because there's.</v>

1767
01:23:26.650 --> 01:23:27.483
<v Speaker 2>It takes energy to move that system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but 26 grams of fat loss per day to me </v>

1768
01:23:31.630 --> 01:23:34.360
<v Speaker 2>is not a physiological like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care about that.</v>

1769
01:23:34.920 --> 01:23:36.610
<v Speaker 2>That's nothing compared to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1770
01:23:36.790 --> 01:23:37.623
<v Speaker 2>if you like low car better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't worry about losing extra 26 grams </v>

1771
01:23:40.931 --> 01:23:43.330
<v Speaker 2>of fat if you like glow car better and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you can sustain that,</v>

1772
01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:44.193
<v Speaker 2>then do low carb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that we seem to be </v>

1773
01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:46.893
<v Speaker 2>getting into here is the difference </v>
<v Speaker 2>between losing weight and optimal </v>

1774
01:23:51.011 --> 01:23:51.844
<v Speaker 2>performance and then optimal performance</v>
<v Speaker 2>mentally hormonally versus optimal </v>

1775
01:23:56.591 --> 01:23:59.080
<v Speaker 2>performance physically in terms of like </v>
<v Speaker 2>athletic,</v>

1776
01:23:59.170 --> 01:24:00.640
<v Speaker 2>athletic pursuits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's,</v>

1777
01:24:00.670 --> 01:24:01.503
<v Speaker 2>here's something else</v>

1778
01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:03.660
<v Speaker 3>type of person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's,</v>

1779
01:24:03.661 --> 01:24:04.494
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't want to put a a teenager </v>

1780
01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:09.210
<v Speaker 3>that's playing football on a ketogenic </v>
<v Speaker 3>diet necessarily.</v>

1781
01:24:10.150 --> 01:24:12.570
<v Speaker 3>Why would that be?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1782
01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:14.880
<v Speaker 3>maybe if they were overweight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that could be beneficial,</v>

1783
01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:15.773
<v Speaker 3>but I think it would decrease his </v>
<v Speaker 3>performance unless he goes through the </v>

1784
01:24:18.481 --> 01:24:21.660
<v Speaker 3>Keto adaptation phase,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's a lot of the.</v>

1785
01:24:21.670 --> 01:24:22.503
<v Speaker 3>At when you're a teenager,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're I would say your carbohydrate </v>

1786
01:24:26.101 --> 01:24:28.100
<v Speaker 3>tolerance is very high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to do.</v>

1787
01:24:28.190 --> 01:24:29.380
<v Speaker 3>I want to adjust this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For My,</v>

1788
01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:30.293
<v Speaker 3>my mind was very high.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could eat huge plates of pasta that I </v>

1789
01:24:32.701 --> 01:24:35.220
<v Speaker 3>could not eat now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just simply couldn't.</v>

1790
01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:37.373
<v Speaker 3>So I think as we age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say our carbohydrate tolerance </v>

1791
01:24:40.770 --> 01:24:45.770
<v Speaker 3>decreases with age because our metabolic</v>
<v Speaker 3>machinery is not as hungry for glucose.</v>

1792
01:24:47.791 --> 01:24:51.210
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're set up and hormonally our </v>
<v Speaker 3>insulin sensitivity is not as high.</v>

1793
01:24:51.211 --> 01:24:52.044
<v Speaker 3>Glycolytic pathways are reduced,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things like that that happens as a </v>

1794
01:24:54.271 --> 01:24:55.104
<v Speaker 3>consequence of age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it makes sense that as we transition </v>

1795
01:24:58.061 --> 01:25:01.260
<v Speaker 3>into age for longevity and for health </v>
<v Speaker 3>span,</v>

1796
01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:03.040
<v Speaker 3>maybe not lifespan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but health span,</v>

1797
01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:04.073
<v Speaker 3>a carbohydrate restriction makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even in some cases the key to genic </v>

1798
01:25:07.201 --> 01:25:09.570
<v Speaker 3>diet makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1799
01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:10.970
<v Speaker 2>but if you look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1800
01:25:10.971 --> 01:25:14.960
<v Speaker 2>so I have to push backs on that and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>not necessarily disagreeing with you.</v>

1801
01:25:16.210 --> 01:25:19.640
<v Speaker 2>I kind of am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at longevity data,</v>

1802
01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:23.600
<v Speaker 2>the actual longevity Davao people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>restrict fat versus carbs live longer.</v>

1803
01:25:24.050 --> 01:25:25.910
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what a new study that came </v>
<v Speaker 2>out showed.</v>

1804
01:25:26.270 --> 01:25:27.103
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

1805
01:25:27.420 --> 01:25:28.253
<v Speaker 3>I'm describing it as also a means of of </v>
<v Speaker 3>because people put on weight as they </v>

1806
01:25:32.411 --> 01:25:33.244
<v Speaker 3>age,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're the low carb and with the </v>

1807
01:25:34.211 --> 01:25:35.044
<v Speaker 3>ketogenic diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that becomes a practical strategy to </v>

1808
01:25:39.231 --> 01:25:42.920
<v Speaker 3>create a sustainable calorie deficit for</v>
<v Speaker 3>losing weight.</v>

1809
01:25:42.921 --> 01:25:43.754
<v Speaker 3>Sustaining that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and also if you elevate ketones over </v>

1810
01:25:45.831 --> 01:25:46.664
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of the new research that's coming </v>

1811
01:25:48.321 --> 01:25:49.220
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1812
01:25:49.221 --> 01:25:52.640
<v Speaker 3>over the last five years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ketones is not just a superior source of</v>

1813
01:25:52.641 --> 01:25:53.474
<v Speaker 3>energy metabolically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it also has epigenetic effects on </v>

1814
01:25:56.511 --> 01:25:57.344
<v Speaker 3>the body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It activate gene pathways that can </v>

1815
01:25:58.761 --> 01:26:02.480
<v Speaker 3>confer resistance against oxidative </v>
<v Speaker 3>stress,</v>

1816
01:26:02.510 --> 01:26:06.110
<v Speaker 3>that longevity pathways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>anti inflammatory pathway in the context</v>

1817
01:26:06.111 --> 01:26:07.370
<v Speaker 3>of a deficit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1818
01:26:07.371 --> 01:26:10.640
<v Speaker 3>not in the context of deficit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could feed ketones,</v>

1819
01:26:10.730 --> 01:26:14.200
<v Speaker 3>take a ketone supplement,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it activates a,</v>

1820
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:15.223
<v Speaker 3>just simply elevating Beta </v>
<v Speaker 3>hydroxybutyrate functions as a histone </v>

1821
01:26:18.231 --> 01:26:21.200
<v Speaker 3>deacetylase inhibitor and can activate </v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

1822
01:26:21.201 --> 01:26:22.034
<v Speaker 3>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a gene programs that can confer </v>

1823
01:26:25.010 --> 01:26:27.470
<v Speaker 3>resistance against many different </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

1824
01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:28.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oxidative stress pathways,</v>

1825
01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:29.833
<v Speaker 3>and also activate or suppress and </v>
<v Speaker 3>inflammatory pathway that's linked with </v>

1826
01:26:34.131 --> 01:26:37.940
<v Speaker 3>many age related chronic diseases and </v>
<v Speaker 3>autoimmune pathways.</v>

1827
01:26:37.941 --> 01:26:41.900
<v Speaker 3>It decreases the activation of the NLRP </v>
<v Speaker 3>three inflammasome.</v>

1828
01:26:42.230 --> 01:26:43.063
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1829
01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:43.993
<v Speaker 2>what about people living longer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're talking about that epidemiology </v>

1830
01:26:46.911 --> 01:26:47.744
<v Speaker 2>study that was like a questionnaire or </v>
<v Speaker 2>people what they ate over a long period </v>

1831
01:26:51.351 --> 01:26:52.184
<v Speaker 2>of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Highly criticized studies and there's a </v>

1832
01:26:55.911 --> 01:26:58.790
<v Speaker 2>lot of co founders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why I'm not as hard to say.</v>

1833
01:26:58.791 --> 01:26:59.624
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to say that the study shows </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if you eat carbs versus fat that </v>

1834
01:27:03.391 --> 01:27:04.710
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you live.</v>

1835
01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:05.553
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say one was causing effect,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of cited in a piece of evidence </v>

1836
01:27:10.160 --> 01:27:10.993
<v Speaker 2>because I don't cherry pick because if </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to give the argument I want </v>

1837
01:27:13.731 --> 01:27:15.920
<v Speaker 2>to give the whole argument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was playing devil's advocate.</v>

1838
01:27:16.250 --> 01:27:18.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that necessarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1839
01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:19.423
<v Speaker 2>if you eat a low carb diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to cause you to live a </v>

1840
01:27:20.631 --> 01:27:22.100
<v Speaker 2>shorter life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't believe that,</v>

1841
01:27:22.610 --> 01:27:23.443
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's important to put all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the data out there because what I see a </v>

1842
01:27:26.241 --> 01:27:27.074
<v Speaker 2>lot of is people just cherry picking and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will pose those with those studies </v>

1843
01:27:29.961 --> 01:27:30.794
<v Speaker 2>they get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They become co founders and everybody </v>

1844
01:27:32.481 --> 01:27:33.460
<v Speaker 2>will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1845
01:27:33.500 --> 01:27:35.390
<v Speaker 2>eat carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You live fat.</v>

1846
01:27:35.391 --> 01:27:37.400
<v Speaker 2>Diets are going to kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it just gets crazy.</v>

1847
01:27:37.401 --> 01:27:38.050
<v Speaker 2>Here's the wire.</v>

1848
01:27:38.050 --> 01:27:39.490
<v Speaker 3>Some of the animal work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1849
01:27:39.491 --> 01:27:40.324
<v Speaker 3>Lena and I both did animal work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think some of the animal work is </v>

1850
01:27:42.401 --> 01:27:43.234
<v Speaker 3>almost more reliable because you have an</v>
<v Speaker 3>inbred strain of animal and you have </v>

1851
01:27:47.531 --> 01:27:50.050
<v Speaker 3>very tight control if you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>genetically identical,</v>

1852
01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:52.060
<v Speaker 3>freely living human,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1853
01:27:52.061 --> 01:27:55.870
<v Speaker 3>he's doing many different things and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's genetic variability,</v>

1854
01:27:56.090 --> 01:27:56.923
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but with animals that it may not always </v>

1855
01:27:58.721 --> 01:28:01.060
<v Speaker 3>be predictive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's informative,</v>

1856
01:28:01.061 --> 01:28:03.120
<v Speaker 3>but not always predictive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think some of the,</v>

1857
01:28:03.430 --> 01:28:04.263
<v Speaker 3>the data,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I read some of the human studies and </v>

1858
01:28:05.831 --> 01:28:09.820
<v Speaker 3>become a more confused,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but going back to the animal data,</v>

1859
01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:14.560
<v Speaker 3>I'm almost more comfortable with some of</v>
<v Speaker 3>these outcomes for animal studies.</v>

1860
01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:15.450
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

1861
01:28:15.450 --> 01:28:19.620
<v Speaker 2>one thing I want to bring up that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>think is really important is we have,</v>

1862
01:28:19.650 --> 01:28:20.483
<v Speaker 2>I think we're all getting to this point </v>
<v Speaker 2>and people out there think that there's </v>

1863
01:28:23.611 --> 01:28:26.250
<v Speaker 2>like this perfect diet that's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>cure everything.</v>

1864
01:28:26.251 --> 01:28:28.550
<v Speaker 2>And all of our ails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact,</v>

1865
01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:32.690
<v Speaker 2>the uncomfortable truth in the fact of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the matter is that if one diet is an.</v>

1866
01:28:32.691 --> 01:28:33.524
<v Speaker 2>I don't know this specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but my guess is if one diet is a better </v>

1867
01:28:36.061 --> 01:28:37.980
<v Speaker 2>for cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be worse for heart disease.</v>

1868
01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:40.770
<v Speaker 2>Or if one diet is better for insulin </v>
<v Speaker 2>resistance,</v>

1869
01:28:41.460 --> 01:28:44.820
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's worse for cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's better for cognitive performance,</v>

1870
01:28:44.821 --> 01:28:46.600
<v Speaker 2>it might be worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't,</v>

1871
01:28:46.630 --> 01:28:50.050
<v Speaker 2>we don't know yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's kind of where is your space at</v>

1872
01:28:50.470 --> 01:28:51.303
<v Speaker 2>now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is why I go back to those big </v>

1873
01:28:52.331 --> 01:28:55.240
<v Speaker 2>picture things of most of the health </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefits.</v>

1874
01:28:55.241 --> 01:28:58.060
<v Speaker 2>Just come from having more muscle.</v>

1875
01:28:58.480 --> 01:29:00.610
<v Speaker 2>Lift weights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lift weights.</v>

1876
01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:01.693
<v Speaker 2>If you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're debating about diets and </v>

1877
01:29:02.581 --> 01:29:03.414
<v Speaker 2>you're not lifting weights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are fucking missing the point </v>

1878
01:29:06.150 --> 01:29:06.983
<v Speaker 2>because that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry I curse a so that I do it on </v>

1879
01:29:10.831 --> 01:29:11.664
<v Speaker 2>twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've seen me.</v>

1880
01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:12.930
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1881
01:29:12.990 --> 01:29:14.550
<v Speaker 2>it's very good at emphasizing your </v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

1882
01:29:14.570 --> 01:29:15.480
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1883
01:29:15.590 --> 01:29:17.460
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fan of it.</v>

1884
01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:18.930
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking awesome.</v>

1885
01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:20.320
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1886
01:29:20.580 --> 01:29:22.140
<v Speaker 2>somebody criticized me for one day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1887
01:29:22.141 --> 01:29:23.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's great about my job?</v>

1888
01:29:23.610 --> 01:29:26.190
<v Speaker 2>I can say fuck as much as I want and </v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody's going to fire me.</v>

1889
01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:28.570
<v Speaker 2>So that is great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1890
01:29:29.220 --> 01:29:31.800
<v Speaker 2>but the big picture things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lift weights,</v>

1891
01:29:31.980 --> 01:29:34.980
<v Speaker 2>create more lean body mass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be active.</v>

1892
01:29:35.100 --> 01:29:36.990
<v Speaker 2>That's a huge thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you're overweight,</v>

1893
01:29:36.991 --> 01:29:37.920
<v Speaker 2>if you're active,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

1894
01:29:37.921 --> 01:29:39.990
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna live fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But on the whole,</v>

1895
01:29:39.991 --> 01:29:40.824
<v Speaker 2>you're going to live longer than the </v>
<v Speaker 2>person who's inactive and then control </v>

1896
01:29:44.491 --> 01:29:47.550
<v Speaker 2>your weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you can even see if you can get to</v>

1897
01:29:47.551 --> 01:29:49.410
<v Speaker 2>a normal weight and maintain it or </v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry,</v>

1898
01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:52.770
<v Speaker 2>normal body fat and maintain it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or if you're a high body fat,</v>

1899
01:29:52.771 --> 01:29:55.080
<v Speaker 2>if you can get to a lower body fat and </v>
<v Speaker 2>maintain it.</v>

1900
01:29:55.940 --> 01:29:57.120
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's 90,</v>

1901
01:29:57.540 --> 01:29:58.373
<v Speaker 2>95 percent of the battle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All this other stuff is five percent </v>

1902
01:30:00.661 --> 01:30:02.940
<v Speaker 2>that we're worrying about that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going back and forth about.</v>

1903
01:30:03.210 --> 01:30:06.540
<v Speaker 2>And that's why I don't want to miss the </v>
<v Speaker 2>context because when people like,</v>

1904
01:30:06.541 --> 01:30:07.374
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll pick on him because he was who </v>

1905
01:30:09.301 --> 01:30:10.560
<v Speaker 2>asked for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gary Taubes.</v>

1906
01:30:10.561 --> 01:30:13.050
<v Speaker 2>But I'm happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm happier we got done for this.</v>

1907
01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:14.960
<v Speaker 2>But I'm going to just interject.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey God,</v>

1908
01:30:15.380 --> 01:30:16.213
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait.</v>

1909
01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:23.000
<v Speaker 2>When people like Gary Taubes say things </v>
<v Speaker 2>like carbs or are causing obesity,</v>

1910
01:30:23.131 --> 01:30:23.964
<v Speaker 2>just carbs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you create this problem where if people </v>

1911
01:30:28.321 --> 01:30:32.100
<v Speaker 2>don't like eating high fat diet or a low</v>
<v Speaker 2>carb diet and they can't sustain it,</v>

1912
01:30:32.101 --> 01:30:34.650
<v Speaker 2>they just feel like they're a big </v>
<v Speaker 2>failure and they just quit.</v>

1913
01:30:35.010 --> 01:30:35.843
<v Speaker 2>Because what's the point?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If carbs are causing fat and I can't </v>

1914
01:30:37.321 --> 01:30:38.154
<v Speaker 2>stop eating carbs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what am I going to have a real hard </v>

1915
01:30:40.201 --> 01:30:42.570
<v Speaker 2>problem with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're saying.</v>

1916
01:30:42.630 --> 01:30:45.450
<v Speaker 2>Discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's important or this nonsense,</v>

1917
01:30:45.630 --> 01:30:49.140
<v Speaker 2>but I think my point is that if you give</v>
<v Speaker 2>people flexibility,</v>

1918
01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:52.200
<v Speaker 2>it usually improves adherence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1919
01:30:52.201 --> 01:30:54.540
<v Speaker 2>And you're talking about from your point</v>
<v Speaker 2>of view,</v>

1920
01:30:54.541 --> 01:30:55.620
<v Speaker 2>coaching people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1921
01:30:55.640 --> 01:30:56.473
<v Speaker 2>And what I would like to see is I would </v>
<v Speaker 2>like to see a diet that's protein and </v>

1922
01:30:58.441 --> 01:31:01.260
<v Speaker 2>calorie controlled study,</v>
<v Speaker 2>protein calorie controlled.</v>

1923
01:31:01.261 --> 01:31:03.030
<v Speaker 2>If anybody knows of one that has done </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

1924
01:31:03.031 --> 01:31:03.864
<v Speaker 2>let me know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Protein and calorie controlled and then </v>

1925
01:31:05.281 --> 01:31:09.120
<v Speaker 2>let people self select higher carb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>higher fat.</v>

1926
01:31:09.570 --> 01:31:10.403
<v Speaker 2>What do you prefer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let them self select and see how well </v>

1927
01:31:12.571 --> 01:31:13.404
<v Speaker 2>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I bet you would see improvements in </v>

1928
01:31:15.001 --> 01:31:16.470
<v Speaker 2>adherence in both groups.</v>

1929
01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:17.913
<v Speaker 3>Dom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were going to.</v>

1930
01:31:18.120 --> 01:31:18.953
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a diet strategy that controls </v>

1931
01:31:23.641 --> 01:31:26.910
<v Speaker 3>your appetite and does not have your </v>
<v Speaker 3>appetite controlling you.</v>

1932
01:31:27.300 --> 01:31:28.133
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I think is accomplished with a </v>

1933
01:31:29.510 --> 01:31:30.343
<v Speaker 3>ketogenetic diet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's also one that's a well </v>

1934
01:31:32.551 --> 01:31:34.260
<v Speaker 3>formulated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One that's controls,</v>

1935
01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:36.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that has fiber and adequate protein.</v>

1936
01:31:37.230 --> 01:31:42.230
<v Speaker 3>A is a strategy that allows you to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>far less fixated on food,</v>

1937
01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:44.640
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're not as hungry and you can</v>

1938
01:31:44.641 --> 01:31:46.590
<v Speaker 3>decrease your meal frequency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if there's,</v>

1939
01:31:46.591 --> 01:31:49.440
<v Speaker 3>I know there's people out there that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>busy people,</v>

1940
01:31:49.441 --> 01:31:50.790
<v Speaker 3>ceos of companies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1941
01:31:50.791 --> 01:31:52.650
<v Speaker 3>students or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1942
01:31:52.651 --> 01:31:53.484
<v Speaker 3>that simply do not have time to prepare </v>
<v Speaker 3>and eat a meals too when they get </v>

1943
01:31:59.561 --> 01:32:00.394
<v Speaker 3>hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So by reducing meal frequency you can </v>

1944
01:32:03.731 --> 01:32:04.564
<v Speaker 3>increase your productivity and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're kind of coaching your body to be </v>

1945
01:32:07.650 --> 01:32:12.550
<v Speaker 3>a better fat burning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's definitely benefits.</v>

1946
01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:13.473
<v Speaker 3>So when you are on a ketogenic diet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you are storing more fat but you are </v>

1947
01:32:16.661 --> 01:32:17.470
<v Speaker 3>burning more fat.</v>

1948
01:32:17.470 --> 01:32:18.303
<v Speaker 3>So think about your adipose tissue as </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bags which have fat coming into </v>

1949
01:32:22.550 --> 01:32:26.470
<v Speaker 3>them and fat leaving them and the fat </v>
<v Speaker 3>oxidation pathways or elevated.</v>

1950
01:32:26.740 --> 01:32:29.680
<v Speaker 3>And when I eat a ton of fat at night </v>
<v Speaker 3>before I go to bed,</v>

1951
01:32:29.900 --> 01:32:30.733
<v Speaker 3>I am like some people carb load.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like fat loading at night and I'm </v>

1952
01:32:34.061 --> 01:32:37.970
<v Speaker 3>pulling off those fat stores during the </v>
<v Speaker 3>day through my adolescence.</v>

1953
01:32:38.620 --> 01:32:40.330
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think about it like that.</v>

1954
01:32:40.331 --> 01:32:41.950
<v Speaker 3>So instead of just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1955
01:32:42.010 --> 01:32:45.730
<v Speaker 3>carbing up at nighttime and I tend to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would wake up hungry,</v>

1956
01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:46.593
<v Speaker 3>I would probably dump insulin and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>wake up with a hypoglycemic cravings in </v>

1957
01:32:49.901 --> 01:32:53.260
<v Speaker 3>the middle of the night if I did that </v>
<v Speaker 3>time restricted eating a,</v>

1958
01:32:53.290 --> 01:32:54.330
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like today,</v>

1959
01:32:54.400 --> 01:32:55.233
<v Speaker 3>like I'm fasting and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and most days that I want to be as </v>

1960
01:32:57.101 --> 01:33:00.580
<v Speaker 3>productive as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will not have my first meal which will</v>

1961
01:33:00.581 --> 01:33:03.190
<v Speaker 3>be typically a ketogenic meal around </v>
<v Speaker 3>4:00</v>

1962
01:33:03.190 --> 01:33:03.610
<v Speaker 3>PM.</v>

1963
01:33:03.610 --> 01:33:05.860
<v Speaker 3>And what time to eat at night?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1964
01:33:05.861 --> 01:33:06.694
<v Speaker 3>I will start,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll do a small meal like at work and </v>

1965
01:33:08.591 --> 01:33:12.520
<v Speaker 3>then I'll eat my big meal at about 7:00,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe 7:00</v>

1966
01:33:12.521 --> 01:33:15.010
<v Speaker 3>and then snack throughout the night and </v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe eat within,</v>

1967
01:33:15.310 --> 01:33:17.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started eating at 4:00</v>

1968
01:33:17.770 --> 01:33:19.360
<v Speaker 3>PM and I finished eating and about 10:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>PM.</v>

1969
01:33:19.420 --> 01:33:21.550
<v Speaker 3>So you basically start eating at the end</v>
<v Speaker 3>of your day.</v>

1970
01:33:21.690 --> 01:33:23.020
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

1971
01:33:25.060 --> 01:33:27.760
<v Speaker 3>and that's very liberating for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

1972
01:33:27.820 --> 01:33:29.710
<v Speaker 3>And I didn't even know this was </v>
<v Speaker 3>possible,</v>

1973
01:33:29.711 --> 01:33:30.544
<v Speaker 3>but that's like back 10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know it was possible to have </v>

1974
01:33:32.981 --> 01:33:33.814
<v Speaker 3>that amount of control over my appetite </v>
<v Speaker 3>and actually feel as lucid and as </v>

1975
01:33:38.021 --> 01:33:41.070
<v Speaker 3>energetic and be able to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1976
01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:42.073
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get with lane and do deadlifts with him </v>

1977
01:33:43.750 --> 01:33:44.583
<v Speaker 3>and actually maintain my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my performance and my strength in the </v>

1978
01:33:46.571 --> 01:33:48.730
<v Speaker 3>gym.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't feel like I'm an outlier either.</v>

1979
01:33:48.800 --> 01:33:49.633
<v Speaker 2>I think it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think that anecdotes are good </v>

1980
01:33:53.630 --> 01:33:55.490
<v Speaker 2>because anecdotes calls us to look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1981
01:33:56.090 --> 01:33:57.600
<v Speaker 2>But I can tell you like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1982
01:33:57.710 --> 01:33:59.630
<v Speaker 2>so for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I usually four times a day,</v>

1983
01:33:59.910 --> 01:34:03.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I protein right now I'm in a gaining</v>

1984
01:34:03.741 --> 01:34:05.720
<v Speaker 2>phase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'm trying to purposely gain weight.</v>

1985
01:34:05.780 --> 01:34:07.880
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully some lean body mass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm coming back from an injury.</v>

1986
01:34:07.881 --> 01:34:09.620
<v Speaker 2>So trying to regain some weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lean body mass.</v>

1987
01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:13.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm eating about 400 to 450 grams of </v>
<v Speaker 2>carbohydrate today.</v>

1988
01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:15.740
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were times when I'll go seven,</v>

1989
01:34:15.770 --> 01:34:16.603
<v Speaker 2>eight hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't eat and I don't really get </v>

1990
01:34:17.661 --> 01:34:19.010
<v Speaker 2>hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1991
01:34:19.130 --> 01:34:20.900
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's 16 hours.</v>

1992
01:34:21.490 --> 01:34:22.323
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>

1993
01:34:22.580 --> 01:34:23.990
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>

1994
01:34:24.620 --> 01:34:26.180
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think I would.</v>

1995
01:34:26.240 --> 01:34:27.073
<v Speaker 2>I go some some nights I'll sleep and </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll wake up and I'll go 12 slash 13 </v>

1996
01:34:30.081 --> 01:34:31.830
<v Speaker 2>hours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'll go in sometimes and,</v>

1997
01:34:32.210 --> 01:34:34.100
<v Speaker 2>and I don't usually get hungry now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

1998
01:34:34.101 --> 01:34:37.580
<v Speaker 2>that's just think that is just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1999
01:34:37.581 --> 01:34:38.414
<v Speaker 2>if you look at some of the things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>all disagree with or are the idea that </v>

2000
01:34:41.571 --> 01:34:42.404
<v Speaker 2>insulin has these big fluctuations and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you become hypoglycemic and that causes </v>

2001
01:34:44.841 --> 01:34:47.810
<v Speaker 2>over feeding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In some people that's the case,</v>

2002
01:34:47.811 --> 01:34:50.810
<v Speaker 2>but most people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they're eating a,</v>

2003
01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:54.050
<v Speaker 2>especially with a higher protein diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that doesn't usually happen.</v>

2004
01:34:54.740 --> 01:34:55.040
<v Speaker 2>I want</v>

2005
01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:57.980
<v Speaker 3>to add that the population,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people are</v>

2006
01:34:57.980 --> 01:34:58.813
<v Speaker 4>not bodybuilders and the population of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of people that lean mostly communicates </v>

2007
01:35:03.021 --> 01:35:08.021
<v Speaker 4>with our on the border of being </v>
<v Speaker 4>metabolically elite and also have a very</v>

2008
01:35:08.451 --> 01:35:09.284
<v Speaker 4>high carb tolerance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're a bodybuilder with a large </v>

2009
01:35:11.211 --> 01:35:15.950
<v Speaker 4>amount of lean body mass,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you are pretty much metabolically set up</v>

2010
01:35:15.980 --> 01:35:16.813
<v Speaker 4>to be a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have a high carb tolerance so that the </v>

2011
01:35:19.281 --> 01:35:20.114
<v Speaker 4>general population is not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So let's talk about Clark polaroids </v>

2012
01:35:22.191 --> 01:35:24.800
<v Speaker 4>because I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's one thing that will disagree on.</v>

2013
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:26.390
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that people are more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2014
01:35:26.391 --> 01:35:27.224
<v Speaker 4>less carb tolerant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that people have sought slower </v>

2015
01:35:30.861 --> 01:35:33.620
<v Speaker 4>and faster metabolic rates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you have a faster metabolic rate,</v>

2016
01:35:33.710 --> 01:35:34.543
<v Speaker 4>you'll be more tolerant by default </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you could just tolerate more </v>

2017
01:35:36.411 --> 01:35:37.300
<v Speaker 4>calories.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I agree with.</v>

2018
01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:41.340
<v Speaker 4>But in a bodybuilder that's 220 pounds </v>
<v Speaker 4>on average,</v>

2019
01:35:41.810 --> 01:35:42.740
<v Speaker 4>on average.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

2020
01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:43.783
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you look at somebody who's on a </v>

2021
01:35:45.531 --> 01:35:46.364
<v Speaker 4>ketogenic diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're actually by definition of carb </v>

2022
01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:49.513
<v Speaker 4>tolerance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are carbohydrate intolerant </v>

2023
01:35:50.870 --> 01:35:53.190
<v Speaker 4>because if you challenge them with a </v>
<v Speaker 4>Bolus of glucose,</v>

2024
01:35:53.191 --> 01:35:54.620
<v Speaker 4>when they click,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can't clear it.</v>

2025
01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:56.230
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that,</v>

2026
01:35:56.250 --> 01:35:58.280
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just because what they're adapted</v>

2027
01:35:58.281 --> 01:35:58.971
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2028
01:35:58.971 --> 01:36:00.590
<v Speaker 4>But there are fat adapted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2029
01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:01.490
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>

2030
01:36:01.490 --> 01:36:02.480
<v Speaker 4>So I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2031
01:36:02.481 --> 01:36:04.520
<v Speaker 4>the first experimental biology we ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>went to,</v>

2032
01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:06.170
<v Speaker 4>this is why,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2033
01:36:06.230 --> 01:36:09.580
<v Speaker 4>even scientists get this shit so wrong </v>
<v Speaker 4>sometimes because again,</v>

2034
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:10.423
<v Speaker 4>they get so in their echo chamber,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't bother to look outside of it </v>

2035
01:36:12.890 --> 01:36:17.180
<v Speaker 4>going to the gym when we first met and </v>
<v Speaker 4>went lane stopped and had a huge meal,</v>

2036
01:36:17.210 --> 01:36:18.710
<v Speaker 4>which to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2037
01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:22.520
<v Speaker 4>you feel like doing or we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>stop and eat pizza for I go squat.</v>

2038
01:36:22.540 --> 01:36:26.630
<v Speaker 4>It's a real heavy fatty meal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Visit the bathroom about five times.</v>

2039
01:36:26.631 --> 01:36:28.280
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't,</v>

2040
01:36:28.340 --> 01:36:29.720
<v Speaker 4>I forgot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think I did eat,</v>

2041
01:36:29.721 --> 01:36:30.554
<v Speaker 4>but it was very abnormal for me to go </v>
<v Speaker 4>eat a meal heavy meal on the way that </v>

2042
01:36:33.771 --> 01:36:34.604
<v Speaker 4>Jim,</v>
<v Speaker 4>holly's like you,</v>

2043
01:36:34.610 --> 01:36:35.750
<v Speaker 4>she,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she hates training,</v>

2044
01:36:35.751 --> 01:36:36.170
<v Speaker 4>fed.</v>

2045
01:36:36.170 --> 01:36:38.330
<v Speaker 4>She wants to be fast and she feels </v>
<v Speaker 4>better that way.</v>

2046
01:36:38.331 --> 01:36:40.250
<v Speaker 4>But that's the individual differences,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2047
01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:42.860
<v Speaker 4>That's the individual differences.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Part of it.</v>

2048
01:36:42.950 --> 01:36:46.400
<v Speaker 4>Part of it may be you're just adapted to</v>
<v Speaker 4>that as well and what you're used to.</v>

2049
01:36:46.401 --> 01:36:47.234
<v Speaker 4>So maybe a psychological thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but some people may just do better that </v>

2050
01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:50.053
<v Speaker 4>we're blood is diverted to your </v>
<v Speaker 4>digestive system and processes and </v>

2051
01:36:53.421 --> 01:36:56.010
<v Speaker 4>that's less blood for the muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you're,</v>

2052
01:36:56.011 --> 01:36:59.200
<v Speaker 4>you're expending energy to digest </v>
<v Speaker 4>breakdown.</v>

2053
01:36:59.220 --> 01:37:02.900
<v Speaker 4>Then similarly is that there has been </v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty debunked.</v>

2054
01:37:03.170 --> 01:37:04.170
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2055
01:37:05.050 --> 01:37:08.090
<v Speaker 4>But something happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's just a fundamental.</v>

2056
01:37:08.110 --> 01:37:12.450
<v Speaker 4>You've got a logical concept that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>are diverting blood resource to,</v>

2057
01:37:12.480 --> 01:37:13.313
<v Speaker 4>to a particular job of a scientist is to</v>
<v Speaker 4>question even those theories we hold </v>

2058
01:37:16.851 --> 01:37:20.010
<v Speaker 4>most to be true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Neil degrasse Tyson says,</v>

2059
01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:20.990
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it,</v>

2060
01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:21.833
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think a small meal actually it can </v>

2061
01:37:23.061 --> 01:37:23.894
<v Speaker 4>be beneficial,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's not like you're using Mongo </v>

2062
01:37:26.950 --> 01:37:28.370
<v Speaker 4>hydrates during the meal.</v>

2063
01:37:28.370 --> 01:37:29.203
<v Speaker 4>You're not using the product.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And how has it been debunked that they </v>

2064
01:37:33.021 --> 01:37:33.854
<v Speaker 4>see that performance isn't worse and </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you don't like is the performance </v>

2065
01:37:38.901 --> 01:37:39.734
<v Speaker 4>specifically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's not a limitation of blood flow </v>

2066
01:37:42.680 --> 01:37:44.450
<v Speaker 4>because you've eaten something to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>muscle.</v>

2067
01:37:44.510 --> 01:37:46.400
<v Speaker 4>There's not a limitation of blood flow </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the muscle.</v>

2068
01:37:46.740 --> 01:37:49.220
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but again,</v>

2069
01:37:49.221 --> 01:37:52.400
<v Speaker 4>some people just do better if they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>faster or have small meals.</v>

2070
01:37:52.520 --> 01:37:54.350
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it may be a psychological thing,</v>

2071
01:37:54.351 --> 01:37:55.184
<v Speaker 4>but I like to feel like I've had a lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>of food and I'm fully fueled for a long </v>

2072
01:37:58.561 --> 01:37:59.394
<v Speaker 4>training session,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but some people will feel kind of </v>

2073
01:38:00.691 --> 01:38:01.340
<v Speaker 4>training.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2074
01:38:01.340 --> 01:38:04.080
<v Speaker 4>like if you're doing something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>squats in a very controlled,</v>

2075
01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:06.990
<v Speaker 4>but if you were doing something like it </v>
<v Speaker 4>might be different.</v>

2076
01:38:06.991 --> 01:38:08.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you were doing Jujitsu,</v>

2077
01:38:08.550 --> 01:38:10.230
<v Speaker 4>but I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you would probably throw up.</v>

2078
01:38:10.530 --> 01:38:11.520
<v Speaker 4>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2079
01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:13.410
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did it very briefly.</v>

2080
01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:15.690
<v Speaker 4>Awesome sport.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I did it very briefly,</v>

2081
01:38:15.691 --> 01:38:16.524
<v Speaker 4>informally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Also really can't have a big meal and </v>

2082
01:38:18.181 --> 01:38:19.014
<v Speaker 4>then go train and get fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd probably have gone to the bathroom </v>

2083
01:38:21.421 --> 01:38:23.370
<v Speaker 4>every few minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't work on a grant.</v>

2084
01:38:23.610 --> 01:38:25.890
<v Speaker 4>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not supposed to talk about guns,</v>

2085
01:38:25.891 --> 01:38:28.470
<v Speaker 4>but mean if I go to the range and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>supposed to have guns.</v>

2086
01:38:28.471 --> 01:38:29.880
<v Speaker 4>My.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's talk about guns.</v>

2087
01:38:29.950 --> 01:38:31.480
<v Speaker 4>When you talk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We talked a lot before.</v>

2088
01:38:32.700 --> 01:38:37.320
<v Speaker 4>My groups are tighter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can better control and if I go in in a</v>

2089
01:38:37.321 --> 01:38:39.610
<v Speaker 4>fed state,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just not as focused as that.</v>

2090
01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:40.473
<v Speaker 4>My vision,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my vision is not as acute in the right </v>

2091
01:38:42.661 --> 01:38:45.480
<v Speaker 4>after a big meal as if I'm fast at 16 </v>
<v Speaker 4>hours,</v>

2092
01:38:45.510 --> 01:38:46.343
<v Speaker 4>but this is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is the hard thing with anecdote </v>

2093
01:38:47.670 --> 01:38:49.670
<v Speaker 4>because we can't tease out whether or </v>
<v Speaker 4>not that's.</v>

2094
01:38:49.740 --> 01:38:50.573
<v Speaker 4>That is an actual physiological thing or</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether you just feel better and you </v>

2095
01:38:53.551 --> 01:38:54.384
<v Speaker 4>think you'll do better so you do better </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the brain is unbelievably </v>

2096
01:38:57.181 --> 01:38:57.630
<v Speaker 4>powerful.</v>

2097
01:38:57.630 --> 01:38:58.463
<v Speaker 4>There was a study and um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I may butcher it because I can't </v>

2098
01:39:00.751 --> 01:39:01.584
<v Speaker 4>remember it exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they took people who had legit </v>

2099
01:39:03.091 --> 01:39:03.924
<v Speaker 4>allergy problems and they gave them a </v>
<v Speaker 4>sugar pill and they said this will </v>

2100
01:39:07.651 --> 01:39:10.650
<v Speaker 4>improve your allergies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It should not have done anything.</v>

2101
01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:12.593
<v Speaker 4>Over half the people reported their </v>
<v Speaker 4>symptoms got better and 30 percent </v>

2102
01:39:15.450 --> 01:39:20.100
<v Speaker 4>actually physiologically got better </v>
<v Speaker 4>because their brain was telling them get</v>

2103
01:39:20.101 --> 01:39:22.680
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's pretty crazy.</v>

2104
01:39:22.890 --> 01:39:23.723
<v Speaker 4>So that's part of probably the best diet</v>
<v Speaker 4>for you might be the Diet you can stick </v>

2105
01:39:27.691 --> 01:39:29.910
<v Speaker 4>to and just feel real positive about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2106
01:39:30.060 --> 01:39:30.893
<v Speaker 4>Because you feel like this might be </v>
<v Speaker 4>someone what's going on with a lot of </v>

2107
01:39:33.481 --> 01:39:34.314
<v Speaker 4>this low carb stuff that people say they</v>
<v Speaker 4>feel so fantastic because there's some </v>

2108
01:39:37.531 --> 01:39:40.290
<v Speaker 4>sort of a placebo effect that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>possible.</v>

2109
01:39:40.320 --> 01:39:41.153
<v Speaker 4>I think part of it is too is that's why </v>
<v Speaker 4>animals studies are given me more </v>

2110
01:39:44.221 --> 01:39:45.054
<v Speaker 4>confidence when I can look at rats or </v>
<v Speaker 4>mice on a ketogenic diet and see and </v>

2111
01:39:49.170 --> 01:39:50.340
<v Speaker 4>objectable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2112
01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:53.250
<v Speaker 4>objective increase or decrease in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>parameter.</v>

2113
01:39:53.250 --> 01:39:55.440
<v Speaker 4>Then I gained confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But here's the thing.</v>

2114
01:39:55.441 --> 01:39:58.020
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that that's a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you feel good about it,</v>

2115
01:39:58.110 --> 01:40:01.140
<v Speaker 4>that's great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just don't try to get on twitter and</v>

2116
01:40:01.141 --> 01:40:01.974
<v Speaker 4>tell everybody all you're going to gain </v>
<v Speaker 4>fat in a deficit because you're eating </v>

2117
01:40:03.991 --> 01:40:04.824
<v Speaker 4>carbs right up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you go to a witch doctor and you </v>

2118
01:40:06.601 --> 01:40:08.220
<v Speaker 4>really believe it might actually help </v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

2119
01:40:08.410 --> 01:40:10.020
<v Speaker 4>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of the,</v>

2120
01:40:10.050 --> 01:40:10.883
<v Speaker 4>one of the number one characteristics of</v>
<v Speaker 4>cancer survivors is that they're </v>

2121
01:40:15.390 --> 01:40:17.160
<v Speaker 4>actually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have a belief in God.</v>

2122
01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:20.550
<v Speaker 4>They believe that they're going to make </v>
<v Speaker 4>it through that.</v>

2123
01:40:20.551 --> 01:40:23.020
<v Speaker 4>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some people cause or effect.</v>

2124
01:40:23.021 --> 01:40:25.170
<v Speaker 4>Some people will argue religious people </v>
<v Speaker 4>will argue,</v>

2125
01:40:25.171 --> 01:40:26.004
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they believe in God and so God is </v>

2126
01:40:26.821 --> 01:40:27.654
<v Speaker 4>helping them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other argument to that is they </v>

2127
01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:33.440
<v Speaker 4>believe that they are going to make it </v>
<v Speaker 4>through there and so they have a moral,</v>

2128
01:40:33.450 --> 01:40:34.283
<v Speaker 4>a better likelihood of doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so your brain is believe in the </v>

2129
01:40:37.831 --> 01:40:38.664
<v Speaker 4>ketogenic diet and believe in God and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think that's a great thing and that day </v>

2130
01:40:43.910 --> 01:40:47.340
<v Speaker 4>they have remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe that you know,</v>

2131
01:40:47.341 --> 01:40:47.710
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2132
01:40:47.710 --> 01:40:49.410
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm a person of faith,</v>

2133
01:40:49.411 --> 01:40:54.411
<v Speaker 4>but I also believe that if you have </v>
<v Speaker 4>faith in the methodology to the patients</v>

2134
01:40:54.610 --> 01:40:55.443
<v Speaker 3>that have communicated with me that </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually believed that this approach is </v>

2135
01:40:58.211 --> 01:40:59.044
<v Speaker 3>gonna work and then they reached that </v>
<v Speaker 3>actual therapeutic state of ketogenetic </v>

2136
01:41:01.931 --> 01:41:06.820
<v Speaker 3>diet have results that kind of defy what</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would expect scientifically.</v>

2137
01:41:06.821 --> 01:41:11.821
<v Speaker 3>So I believe it's working </v>
<v Speaker 3>physiologically and also psychologically</v>

2138
01:41:12.010 --> 01:41:14.740
<v Speaker 3>there is immuno psycho therapy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2139
01:41:14.741 --> 01:41:15.574
<v Speaker 3>Or immunology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So our brain can actually control many </v>

2140
01:41:20.081 --> 01:41:20.914
<v Speaker 3>different physiological processes </v>
<v Speaker 3>including our immune system and that </v>

2141
01:41:24.730 --> 01:41:25.563
<v Speaker 3>that is something that's under </v>
<v Speaker 3>appreciated and under studied and that </v>

2142
01:41:27.731 --> 01:41:32.320
<v Speaker 3>really needs to be studied in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 3>eating a large meal before training.</v>

2143
01:41:33.070 --> 01:41:36.610
<v Speaker 3>Surely your body has to use up some of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the resources to digest.</v>

2144
01:41:36.940 --> 01:41:38.950
<v Speaker 3>You don't think that it's blood flow to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the muscle.</v>

2145
01:41:39.540 --> 01:41:40.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been debunked.</v>

2146
01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:45.420
<v Speaker 2>They show that the blood flow to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscle is not limiting.</v>

2147
01:41:45.450 --> 01:41:47.880
<v Speaker 2>If you've had a meal before you train.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2148
01:41:48.390 --> 01:41:52.560
<v Speaker 2>Now the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but some people don't like that.</v>

2149
01:41:52.590 --> 01:41:54.390
<v Speaker 2>It's a very individual thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It probably,</v>

2150
01:41:54.420 --> 01:41:56.710
<v Speaker 2>it may be a psychological thing with me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

2151
01:41:56.810 --> 01:41:57.643
<v Speaker 2>I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand that I'm an idiot like </v>

2152
01:41:59.041 --> 01:42:00.630
<v Speaker 2>everybody else out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2153
01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:01.673
<v Speaker 2>So I'm subject to bias and a </v>
<v Speaker 2>psychological influence like anybody </v>

2154
01:42:06.661 --> 01:42:09.120
<v Speaker 2>else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just used that to my advantage.</v>

2155
01:42:09.300 --> 01:42:11.310
<v Speaker 2>If I feel good about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why would I not do it?</v>

2156
01:42:12.390 --> 01:42:13.950
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you train in the morning,</v>

2157
01:42:13.951 --> 01:42:14.784
<v Speaker 2>do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like heading to the gym first thing in </v>

2158
01:42:16.141 --> 01:42:16.974
<v Speaker 2>the morning?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holly tries to stop me because then I </v>

2159
01:42:18.541 --> 01:42:20.400
<v Speaker 2>usually end up going to the bathroom for</v>
<v Speaker 2>like five times,</v>

2160
01:42:20.401 --> 01:42:21.234
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll eat a little bit less in the </v>

2161
01:42:23.311 --> 01:42:24.144
<v Speaker 2>morning if I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I'm going to go straight in and </v>

2162
01:42:25.411 --> 01:42:26.244
<v Speaker 2>train.</v>

2163
01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:27.780
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things that,</v>

2164
01:42:27.870 --> 01:42:31.950
<v Speaker 2>that going back that so many scientists </v>
<v Speaker 2>miss is that context,</v>

2165
01:42:31.951 --> 01:42:34.260
<v Speaker 2>like most people miss context,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but scientists,</v>

2166
01:42:34.261 --> 01:42:35.094
<v Speaker 2>even ms dot context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first experimental biology study </v>

2167
01:42:37.500 --> 01:42:40.380
<v Speaker 2>or first experimental biology symposium </v>
<v Speaker 2>we ever went to,</v>

2168
01:42:40.710 --> 01:42:45.710
<v Speaker 2>there was a poster where they fed people</v>
<v Speaker 2>a ketogenic diet or they fed them a high</v>

2169
01:42:46.201 --> 01:42:47.034
<v Speaker 2>carb diet and then at the end of six </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks they challenged them with 100 </v>

2170
01:42:49.651 --> 01:42:53.850
<v Speaker 2>grams of glucose and looked how long it </v>
<v Speaker 2>took for them to clear that glucose.</v>

2171
01:42:54.390 --> 01:42:55.223
<v Speaker 2>The ketogenic diet people would have </v>
<v Speaker 2>been worse than type two diabetics at </v>

2172
01:42:59.461 --> 01:43:01.030
<v Speaker 2>clearing glucose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

2173
01:43:01.440 --> 01:43:03.780
<v Speaker 2>Whereas people eating a high carb diet </v>
<v Speaker 2>cleared it just fine.</v>

2174
01:43:03.990 --> 01:43:04.823
<v Speaker 2>Right now if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you just looked at these numbers as </v>

2175
01:43:06.571 --> 01:43:07.940
<v Speaker 2>Dr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>

2176
01:43:08.010 --> 01:43:09.480
<v Speaker 2>you're diabetic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2177
01:43:09.481 --> 01:43:10.314
<v Speaker 2>that's what they were adapted to and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenged the person with the poster I </v>

2178
01:43:12.991 --> 01:43:13.740
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he,</v>

2179
01:43:13.740 --> 01:43:16.590
<v Speaker 2>for all you kidogenic diet people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>hate me on twitter,</v>

2180
01:43:16.980 --> 01:43:18.460
<v Speaker 2>I defend the Akita,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't it?</v>

2181
01:43:18.510 --> 01:43:21.180
<v Speaker 2>When it is time to be defended,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said to the girl,</v>

2182
01:43:22.350 --> 01:43:25.860
<v Speaker 2>if you had fed a high fat meal to these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

2183
01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:28.230
<v Speaker 2>you would have seen the same thing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>reverse.</v>

2184
01:43:28.890 --> 01:43:31.590
<v Speaker 2>If you would have fed a high fat meals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who are out of the ketogenic diet</v>

2185
01:43:31.770 --> 01:43:32.603
<v Speaker 2>and then a high carb diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would have seen really elevated </v>

2186
01:43:35.730 --> 01:43:38.660
<v Speaker 2>triglycerides,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ldl cholesterol,</v>

2187
01:43:38.820 --> 01:43:40.060
<v Speaker 2>ldl cholesterol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Calabar,</v>

2188
01:43:40.070 --> 01:43:43.590
<v Speaker 2>Crohn's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people who were carpet acted because</v>

2189
01:43:43.591 --> 01:43:46.170
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't being cleared because that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not what you're adapted to.</v>

2190
01:43:46.230 --> 01:43:48.590
<v Speaker 2>But people miss that whole context is a</v>

2191
01:43:48.610 --> 01:43:51.480
<v Speaker 3>good analogy in his book.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That book where if you have a,</v>

2192
01:43:51.540 --> 01:43:53.000
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a factory,</v>

2193
01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:57.260
<v Speaker 3>military factory that's making planes </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then it has to switch over to making</v>

2194
01:43:57.290 --> 01:43:59.810
<v Speaker 3>a ship's right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you,</v>

2195
01:43:59.811 --> 01:44:03.830
<v Speaker 3>it takes a lot of time to change sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the processes that take place.</v>

2196
01:44:04.130 --> 01:44:06.950
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the same thing as sort of happening.</v>

2197
01:44:06.951 --> 01:44:08.840
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're giving your body a different fuel</v>

2198
01:44:08.841 --> 01:44:09.674
<v Speaker 3>source.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it has to ramp up the enzymatic </v>

2199
01:44:12.170 --> 01:44:14.330
<v Speaker 3>machinery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pathways,</v>

2200
01:44:14.331 --> 01:44:18.410
<v Speaker 3>the regulatory pathways and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>transporters even to basically use those</v>

2201
01:44:18.411 --> 01:44:19.191
<v Speaker 3>fuels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2202
01:44:19.191 --> 01:44:20.024
<v Speaker 3>And the misunderstanding of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or at least an ignorance as one of the </v>

2203
01:44:22.101 --> 01:44:25.310
<v Speaker 3>more frustrating things online when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>hear like nonsense people,</v>

2204
01:44:25.530 --> 01:44:30.530
<v Speaker 3>these Internet air quote experts talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about the negative aspects of the key to</v>

2205
01:44:31.221 --> 01:44:33.200
<v Speaker 3>genic dye that they tried it and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>felt weak.</v>

2206
01:44:33.590 --> 01:44:34.820
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean you tried it,</v>

2207
01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:35.990
<v Speaker 3>you tried it for a day.</v>

2208
01:44:36.010 --> 01:44:38.150
<v Speaker 3>Do you try it for three days?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got it for a month.</v>

2209
01:44:38.151 --> 01:44:39.080
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get the fuck Outta here.</v>

2210
01:44:39.081 --> 01:44:40.640
<v Speaker 3>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2211
01:44:40.641 --> 01:44:42.280
<v Speaker 3>It's important.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when,</v>

2212
01:44:42.300 --> 01:44:43.133
<v Speaker 3>when you review a study and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you have a study in your book </v>

2213
01:44:47.001 --> 01:44:47.834
<v Speaker 3>actually that shows in the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You basically say the key to genic diet </v>

2214
01:44:51.231 --> 01:44:53.600
<v Speaker 3>can hurt your performance in the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2215
01:44:53.601 --> 01:44:54.434
<v Speaker 3>and you reference a race walking study </v>
<v Speaker 3>where I think they did the key to genic </v>

2216
01:44:57.531 --> 01:45:00.260
<v Speaker 3>diet for like three weeks or something </v>
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>

2217
01:45:00.261 --> 01:45:01.130
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2218
01:45:01.220 --> 01:45:02.053
<v Speaker 3>I think we came back around and said </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it's probably fine once you're </v>

2219
01:45:04.461 --> 01:45:06.660
<v Speaker 3>adapted to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once you're adapted to it,</v>

2220
01:45:07.040 --> 01:45:08.450
<v Speaker 3>what's the time period we're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about?</v>

2221
01:45:08.990 --> 01:45:09.823
<v Speaker 3>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did not feel myself after it took me </v>

2222
01:45:12.291 --> 01:45:13.124
<v Speaker 3>about three to four months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then you've got to realize that </v>

2223
01:45:15.201 --> 01:45:17.600
<v Speaker 3>there's a learning curve to doing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ketogenic Diet.</v>

2224
01:45:17.600 --> 01:45:19.430
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if I go back to my notes,</v>

2225
01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:20.533
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean my performance in the gym and </v>

2226
01:45:22.371 --> 01:45:24.830
<v Speaker 3>just general wellbeing took about three </v>
<v Speaker 3>to four months.</v>

2227
01:45:24.910 --> 01:45:28.070
<v Speaker 3>Do you use an app to a child or </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything?</v>

2228
01:45:28.580 --> 01:45:29.413
<v Speaker 3>I did a my fitness pal and stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I just know I'm a creature of habit </v>

2229
01:45:33.531 --> 01:45:37.220
<v Speaker 3>so we basically just buy the same food </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the time and I can,</v>

2230
01:45:37.221 --> 01:45:38.054
<v Speaker 3>I measure things on scales and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 3>just as a scientist so I can look at </v>

2231
01:45:41.330 --> 01:45:45.710
<v Speaker 3>some powder on a scale and do 250 </v>
<v Speaker 3>milligrams or minus,</v>

2232
01:45:45.740 --> 01:45:46.573
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10,</v>

2233
01:45:46.580 --> 01:45:47.790
<v Speaker 3>10 milligram.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>

2234
01:45:47.791 --> 01:45:51.530
<v Speaker 3>I've measured things out to where I can </v>
<v Speaker 3>look at a plate and basically give you.</v>

2235
01:45:51.531 --> 01:45:52.364
<v Speaker 3>The macro is pretty tight and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you do that or have you </v>

2236
01:45:55.131 --> 01:45:56.900
<v Speaker 3>ever done Quito for long periods of </v>
<v Speaker 3>time?</v>

2237
01:45:56.960 --> 01:45:58.400
<v Speaker 3>I've done it before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2238
01:45:58.401 --> 01:46:00.680
<v Speaker 3>And he hasn't been Keto adapted though.</v>

2239
01:46:00.770 --> 01:46:02.980
<v Speaker 3>I would argue that the ketones in my </v>
<v Speaker 3>life,</v>

2240
01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:07.070
<v Speaker 3>but I just wanted to do it for about </v>
<v Speaker 3>eight weeks.</v>

2241
01:46:07.250 --> 01:46:09.020
<v Speaker 3>So you could argue that I didn't do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>long enough,</v>

2242
01:46:09.021 --> 01:46:11.660
<v Speaker 3>but my thing is like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all my blood markers are healthy.</v>

2243
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:13.280
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see.</v>

2244
01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:14.263
<v Speaker 3>So I did Quito at maintenance and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't see really much improvement in </v>

2245
01:46:16.701 --> 01:46:18.680
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything kind of stayed the same.</v>

2246
01:46:18.681 --> 01:46:19.240
<v Speaker 3>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

2247
01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:21.410
<v Speaker 3>what different energy when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when was this,</v>

2248
01:46:21.530 --> 01:46:22.363
<v Speaker 3>what year was this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would've been probably after my </v>

2249
01:46:26.871 --> 01:46:29.060
<v Speaker 3>bodybuilding show before I got back into</v>
<v Speaker 3>powerlifting.</v>

2250
01:46:29.160 --> 01:46:32.690
<v Speaker 3>So it would have been some in like 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you like post about it?</v>

2251
01:46:32.691 --> 01:46:34.940
<v Speaker 3>And so I want to go back because I </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't,</v>

2252
01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:35.833
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to really like get the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrath of anybody on me at the time </v>

2253
01:46:40.100 --> 01:46:41.960
<v Speaker 3>trying it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I'm old and can take a rest.</v>

2254
01:46:41.961 --> 01:46:44.280
<v Speaker 3>I just don't care that much anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

2255
01:46:44.420 --> 01:46:45.253
<v Speaker 3>I didn't live performance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't go down that in the first few </v>

2256
01:46:47.751 --> 01:46:49.800
<v Speaker 3>weeks it did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then it was fine.</v>

2257
01:46:50.190 --> 01:46:53.130
<v Speaker 2>I just like the flexibility of having </v>
<v Speaker 2>some carbs.</v>

2258
01:46:53.710 --> 01:46:54.543
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked having that flexibility because </v>

2259
01:46:55.591 --> 01:46:57.140
<v Speaker 2>if you it popcorn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember.</v>

2260
01:46:57.150 --> 01:46:57.983
<v Speaker 2>Yes I do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you know popcorn is great though </v>

2261
01:46:59.791 --> 01:47:01.770
<v Speaker 2>because they see as higher protein and </v>
<v Speaker 2>higher fiber.</v>

2262
01:47:02.100 --> 01:47:04.760
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if,</v>

2263
01:47:05.990 --> 01:47:08.130
<v Speaker 2>if I was going to commit to it as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle,</v>

2264
01:47:08.340 --> 01:47:10.680
<v Speaker 2>then that will be fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but unless you're willing to,</v>

2265
01:47:10.920 --> 01:47:11.753
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's not something you're willing </v>

2266
01:47:12.601 --> 01:47:16.620
<v Speaker 2>to stick to for life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to rethink if you're wanting to</v>

2267
01:47:16.621 --> 01:47:20.430
<v Speaker 2>do it or not benefiting going on and off</v>
<v Speaker 2>ketogenic diets.</v>

2268
01:47:20.431 --> 01:47:21.264
<v Speaker 2>Correct.</v>

2269
01:47:22.270 --> 01:47:25.240
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you do a key to genic diet and you</v>

2270
01:47:25.241 --> 01:47:26.074
<v Speaker 3>want to stay in a state of Ketosis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the days that I do intermittent fasting </v>

2271
01:47:28.991 --> 01:47:31.480
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I didn't do like five years ago,</v>

2272
01:47:31.630 --> 01:47:35.560
<v Speaker 3>I don't necessarily do the key.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do a high higher protein,</v>

2273
01:47:35.590 --> 01:47:36.423
<v Speaker 3>low carb,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but my macros or not key to genic </v>

2274
01:47:38.890 --> 01:47:41.800
<v Speaker 3>typically not all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes they are,</v>

2275
01:47:42.790 --> 01:47:43.623
<v Speaker 3>but there are different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you could do intermittent fasting </v>

2276
01:47:45.430 --> 01:47:48.760
<v Speaker 3>with a car based diet and still get </v>
<v Speaker 3>ketones.</v>

2277
01:47:48.810 --> 01:47:50.590
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the end of your fast.</v>

2278
01:47:50.591 --> 01:47:51.424
<v Speaker 3>You could do low carb ketogenic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually think it's a little bit </v>

2279
01:47:54.101 --> 01:47:56.800
<v Speaker 3>better to be metabolically flexible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I'll throw in.</v>

2280
01:47:56.801 --> 01:47:57.634
<v Speaker 3>I tend to eat a lot of vegetables and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then throw in some fruits to have a few </v>

2281
01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:04.480
<v Speaker 3>days a week where a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it may kick me out of Ketosis,</v>

2282
01:48:04.481 --> 01:48:07.660
<v Speaker 3>but during the middle of the day when I </v>
<v Speaker 3>need to be at my best,</v>

2283
01:48:07.661 --> 01:48:08.494
<v Speaker 3>I pretty much always I'm running low to </v>
<v Speaker 3>moderate ketones during the day and I </v>

2284
01:48:11.921 --> 01:48:14.260
<v Speaker 3>can do that with different strategies </v>
<v Speaker 3>now you know,</v>

2285
01:48:14.261 --> 01:48:16.230
<v Speaker 3>with my body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because as much as I kick you out ptosis</v>

2286
01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:17.011
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I kind of.</v>

2287
01:48:17.011 --> 01:48:22.011
<v Speaker 3>That's at nighttime,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lady and a half of a dark chocolate.</v>

2288
01:48:23.591 --> 01:48:26.920
<v Speaker 3>One or two things of dark chocolate and </v>
<v Speaker 3>a which is maybe 15,</v>

2289
01:48:26.921 --> 01:48:27.754
<v Speaker 3>20 grams of carbs and maybe a half cup </v>
<v Speaker 3>of blueberries and then a big salad and </v>

2290
01:48:33.161 --> 01:48:34.360
<v Speaker 3>some vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Typically</v>

2291
01:48:34.620 --> 01:48:36.810
<v Speaker 2>green vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you say kicked you out of Ketosis,</v>

2292
01:48:36.870 --> 01:48:40.170
<v Speaker 2>so if you measure your blood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your ketones dropped below what level?</v>

2293
01:48:40.830 --> 01:48:44.790
<v Speaker 3>A point five and I typically don't even </v>
<v Speaker 3>measure at night,</v>

2294
01:48:44.791 --> 01:48:45.624
<v Speaker 3>but I wake up in the morning and I might</v>
<v Speaker 3>be about point five and then that goes </v>

2295
01:48:48.631 --> 01:48:50.940
<v Speaker 3>up throughout the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the middle part of the day,</v>

2296
01:48:50.970 --> 01:48:53.550
<v Speaker 3>I'm typically running one between one to</v>
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>

2297
01:48:53.551 --> 01:48:54.384
<v Speaker 3>sometimes three milli moles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The urine strips are only effective in </v>

2298
01:48:59.131 --> 01:49:01.080
<v Speaker 3>the early stages of Ketosis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that correct?</v>

2299
01:49:01.110 --> 01:49:06.090
<v Speaker 3>Yak because in the beginning you spill </v>
<v Speaker 3>out a lot of ketones in your urine,</v>

2300
01:49:06.091 --> 01:49:09.840
<v Speaker 3>but as you increase ketone transport and</v>
<v Speaker 3>utilization over time,</v>

2301
01:49:09.870 --> 01:49:12.540
<v Speaker 3>less of them end up in your urine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much time does that,</v>

2302
01:49:12.660 --> 01:49:14.760
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>depends on the person.</v>

2303
01:49:14.761 --> 01:49:15.594
<v Speaker 3>But after about two or three weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you may see less of a color change on </v>

2304
01:49:18.721 --> 01:49:20.880
<v Speaker 3>the urine strips,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you didn't change your diet.</v>

2305
01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:24.480
<v Speaker 3>Is there another effective method other </v>
<v Speaker 3>than the pricking the finger?</v>

2306
01:49:24.540 --> 01:49:25.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2307
01:49:25.280 --> 01:49:26.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think the blood,</v>

2308
01:49:26.901 --> 01:49:27.900
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2309
01:49:27.901 --> 01:49:31.060
<v Speaker 3>Abbott Labs makes the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>precision Xtra.</v>

2310
01:49:31.130 --> 01:49:33.300
<v Speaker 3>There's the Quito Mojo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which I also use.</v>

2311
01:49:33.301 --> 01:49:34.134
<v Speaker 3>We use in the lab with a Quito Mojo is a</v>
<v Speaker 3>blood measurement and glucose </v>

2312
01:49:38.071 --> 01:49:38.904
<v Speaker 3>measurement device.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's essentially a because Abbott </v>

2313
01:49:41.941 --> 01:49:43.020
<v Speaker 3>cornered the market,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2314
01:49:43.021 --> 01:49:43.854
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they basically allow you to check your </v>

2315
01:49:45.601 --> 01:49:49.180
<v Speaker 3>ketones for a dollar a strip instead of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2316
01:49:49.181 --> 01:49:52.030
<v Speaker 3>three or $4 or $5,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's still pricking your finger,</v>

2317
01:49:52.780 --> 01:49:55.180
<v Speaker 3>pricking your finger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't use the dove,</v>

2318
01:49:55.190 --> 01:49:57.400
<v Speaker 3>I actually use a syringe and just take a</v>
<v Speaker 3>running,</v>

2319
01:49:57.401 --> 01:49:59.890
<v Speaker 3>start in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jab my finger now because it doesn't get</v>

2320
01:49:59.940 --> 01:50:02.460
<v Speaker 3>calluses like you do on your fingers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So knowing a,</v>

2321
01:50:02.500 --> 01:50:03.910
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Kinda used to it,</v>

2322
01:50:03.911 --> 01:50:05.260
<v Speaker 3>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2323
01:50:05.350 --> 01:50:10.160
<v Speaker 3>the urine strip is actually pretty good </v>
<v Speaker 3>relative marker and the uh,</v>

2324
01:50:10.300 --> 01:50:11.133
<v Speaker 3>Siemens a multistage sg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll measure ketones and then nine </v>

2325
01:50:15.971 --> 01:50:19.380
<v Speaker 3>other things like that measure kidney </v>
<v Speaker 3>function and,</v>

2326
01:50:19.381 --> 01:50:21.160
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your blood glucose and things like that.</v>

2327
01:50:21.161 --> 01:50:21.994
<v Speaker 3>So I recommend that it's twenty five </v>
<v Speaker 3>cents a strip and then there's the </v>

2328
01:50:24.041 --> 01:50:25.870
<v Speaker 3>breath,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a key tonics meter.</v>

2329
01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:29.420
<v Speaker 3>You blow into it and it measures breath </v>
<v Speaker 3>acetone and uh,</v>

2330
01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:32.800
<v Speaker 3>the level is also another breath acetone</v>
<v Speaker 3>measurement system.</v>

2331
01:50:32.801 --> 01:50:34.150
<v Speaker 3>Ask about that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah,</v>

2332
01:50:34.151 --> 01:50:36.040
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>breath,</v>

2333
01:50:36.041 --> 01:50:38.830
<v Speaker 3>acetone highly correlates the fat </v>
<v Speaker 3>oxidation.</v>

2334
01:50:38.950 --> 01:50:41.110
<v Speaker 3>So if your breath,</v>
<v Speaker 3>acetone is high,</v>

2335
01:50:41.111 --> 01:50:44.020
<v Speaker 3>you are burning a lot of fat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I sit there an issue with people that</v>

2336
01:50:44.021 --> 01:50:47.560
<v Speaker 3>are key in the state of Ketosis and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>get pulled over for drunk driving.</v>

2337
01:50:48.820 --> 01:50:49.653
<v Speaker 3>A couple of lawyers contacted me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's some cases going on right now </v>

2338
01:50:51.641 --> 01:50:56.050
<v Speaker 3>and they wanted me to weigh in on that </v>
<v Speaker 3>breathalyzers because of the,</v>

2339
01:50:56.150 --> 01:50:59.160
<v Speaker 3>what'd you say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Acetone breath is.</v>

2340
01:50:59.920 --> 01:51:02.770
<v Speaker 3>It uses the same technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a breath acetone,</v>

2341
01:51:02.771 --> 01:51:03.604
<v Speaker 3>and if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that if you drink alcohol and do </v>

2342
01:51:07.001 --> 01:51:10.720
<v Speaker 3>a breath ketone meter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can kind of pin it depending on what</v>

2343
01:51:10.721 --> 01:51:14.980
<v Speaker 3>meter you're using.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're using a breath for breath,</v>

2344
01:51:14.981 --> 01:51:16.040
<v Speaker 3>ketone meter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're using,</v>

2345
01:51:16.090 --> 01:51:18.440
<v Speaker 3>if you have a breath,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2346
01:51:18.730 --> 01:51:22.000
<v Speaker 3>alcohol measurement and you're in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>state of Ketosis,</v>

2347
01:51:22.001 --> 01:51:26.110
<v Speaker 3>I have not seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Depending on the device that you'll have</v>

2348
01:51:26.111 --> 01:51:28.150
<v Speaker 3>a false positive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If that's your question,</v>

2349
01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:30.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some devices can,</v>

2350
01:51:30.190 --> 01:51:31.300
<v Speaker 3>it depends on the device.</v>

2351
01:51:31.330 --> 01:51:33.850
<v Speaker 2>So one thing I'll bring up because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>

2352
01:51:33.940 --> 01:51:34.773
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you work with these kinds of </v>

2353
01:51:35.561 --> 01:51:40.240
<v Speaker 2>metabolically elite people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the problems I say what you're</v>

2354
01:51:40.241 --> 01:51:41.074
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you kind of take yourself up to </v>

2355
01:51:42.221 --> 01:51:45.250
<v Speaker 2>the point where you're sort of getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of ketosis and then going back in,</v>

2356
01:51:45.640 --> 01:51:46.473
<v Speaker 2>that's probably fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most people aren't going to do it </v>

2357
01:51:48.671 --> 01:51:49.870
<v Speaker 2>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to be like,</v>

2358
01:51:49.990 --> 01:51:51.490
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a cheesecake,</v>

2359
01:51:51.640 --> 01:51:53.350
<v Speaker 2>or oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't take it anymore.</v>

2360
01:51:53.351 --> 01:51:54.370
<v Speaker 2>And I had pizza,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

2361
01:51:54.700 --> 01:51:57.040
<v Speaker 2>that's really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you see progress,</v>

2362
01:51:57.050 --> 01:51:57.883
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who intermittent fast decrease </v>

2363
01:51:59.571 --> 01:52:02.780
<v Speaker 3>that window time and overconsume on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2364
01:52:02.781 --> 01:52:04.160
<v Speaker 3>So that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a big problem.</v>

2365
01:52:04.190 --> 01:52:04.940
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

2366
01:52:04.940 --> 01:52:07.490
<v Speaker 2>actually I wanted to bring up </v>
<v Speaker 2>intermittent fasting too because I think</v>

2367
01:52:07.670 --> 01:52:09.170
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you.</v>

2368
01:52:09.860 --> 01:52:12.910
<v Speaker 2>So the studies on intermittent fasting </v>
<v Speaker 2>show that um,</v>

2369
01:52:13.400 --> 01:52:15.230
<v Speaker 2>you lose the same amount of calories are</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same,</v>

2370
01:52:15.290 --> 01:52:16.970
<v Speaker 2>you lose same amount of weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same by the fat,</v>

2371
01:52:17.840 --> 01:52:18.673
<v Speaker 2>maybe might be at risk for a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>more lean body mass loss just because </v>

2372
01:52:21.591 --> 01:52:23.840
<v Speaker 2>you're attributing protein synthesis </v>
<v Speaker 2>left less often.</v>

2373
01:52:24.650 --> 01:52:25.483
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do have a little bit lower insulin </v>

2374
01:52:27.891 --> 01:52:28.724
<v Speaker 2>levels it seems like now whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's again beneficial based on the </v>

2375
01:52:32.310 --> 01:52:34.790
<v Speaker 2>research that we talked about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unlikely insulin sensitivity,</v>

2376
01:52:35.570 --> 01:52:37.760
<v Speaker 2>insulin sensitivity was a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>better again.</v>

2377
01:52:37.761 --> 01:52:38.594
<v Speaker 2>So there are some techniques you can do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people bring up things like a </v>

2378
01:52:41.340 --> 01:52:45.500
<v Speaker 2>typology and inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>

2379
01:52:45.770 --> 01:52:49.190
<v Speaker 2>I kind of get um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the soil,</v>

2380
01:52:49.191 --> 01:52:51.050
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you just calorically restrict,</v>

2381
01:52:51.080 --> 01:52:54.290
<v Speaker 2>you increase autophagy and you increase,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you decrease inflammation.</v>

2382
01:52:54.650 --> 01:52:55.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2383
01:52:55.110 --> 01:52:55.943
<v Speaker 3>you don't get an autophagy is dependent </v>
<v Speaker 3>upon the decrease in certain amino </v>

2384
01:53:00.931 --> 01:53:01.764
<v Speaker 3>acids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Glucose and insulin and you achieve </v>

2385
01:53:04.830 --> 01:53:05.663
<v Speaker 3>those biomarkers states at a more </v>
<v Speaker 3>significant level doing intermittent </v>

2386
01:53:10.501 --> 01:53:12.990
<v Speaker 3>fasting and then you would and they are </v>
<v Speaker 3>the autophagy regulate.</v>

2387
01:53:13.020 --> 01:53:13.853
<v Speaker 3>Can you send me the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the the reason I am amp amp kinase </v>

2388
01:53:18.030 --> 01:53:18.863
<v Speaker 3>leucine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so if you're eating various meals </v>

2389
01:53:21.720 --> 01:53:22.553
<v Speaker 3>throughout the day three times a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you know your blood leucine levels </v>

2390
01:53:25.891 --> 01:53:26.710
<v Speaker 3>will be</v>

2391
01:53:26.710 --> 01:53:28.810
<v Speaker 2>you gotta keep it in context of 24 </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>

2392
01:53:28.930 --> 01:53:29.763
<v Speaker 2>So people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people do this with fat storage and </v>

2393
01:53:32.921 --> 01:53:33.940
<v Speaker 2>oxidation as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>

2394
01:53:33.941 --> 01:53:35.170
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

2395
01:53:35.171 --> 01:53:37.960
<v Speaker 2>if you're fasting all this time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're burning so much body fat.</v>

2396
01:53:38.170 --> 01:53:39.003
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then by definition if you're eating </v>

2397
01:53:40.541 --> 01:53:43.120
<v Speaker 2>less at these times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to eat more at this time.</v>

2398
01:53:43.180 --> 01:53:44.013
<v Speaker 2>If you're keeping calories the same and </v>
<v Speaker 2>so during that time post-meal you're </v>

2399
01:53:47.381 --> 01:53:51.100
<v Speaker 2>going to store a lot more fat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have much higher insulin</v>

2400
01:53:51.160 --> 01:53:51.850
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe not.</v>

2401
01:53:51.850 --> 01:53:52.750
<v Speaker 2>Maybe lower overall</v>

2402
01:53:53.370 --> 01:53:54.203
<v Speaker 3>metabolism.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're overshooting and those calories </v>

2403
01:53:56.911 --> 01:53:57.700
<v Speaker 3>have to go.</v>

2404
01:53:57.700 --> 01:54:02.360
<v Speaker 2>So point being over 24 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't see differences in fat loss or</v>

2405
01:54:02.361 --> 01:54:04.580
<v Speaker 2>fat gain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Intermittent fasting versus non.</v>

2406
01:54:05.150 --> 01:54:05.983
<v Speaker 2>I would be interested in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflammation stuff and the autophagy </v>

2407
01:54:07.551 --> 01:54:08.384
<v Speaker 2>stuff because again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>caloric restriction in of itself </v>

2408
01:54:09.710 --> 01:54:13.130
<v Speaker 2>increases or decreases inflammation </v>
<v Speaker 2>increases a tough to.</v>

2409
01:54:13.131 --> 01:54:13.964
<v Speaker 2>Interestingly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the sugar studies they did with </v>

2410
01:54:15.511 --> 01:54:18.020
<v Speaker 2>with higher sugar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with still calorically restricted,</v>

2411
01:54:18.350 --> 01:54:19.183
<v Speaker 2>they showed decreases in inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So inflammation is largely an issue of </v>

2412
01:54:24.650 --> 01:54:25.483
<v Speaker 2>caloric restriction or excess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you guys think that that's what's </v>

2413
01:54:28.701 --> 01:54:30.950
<v Speaker 2>going on with this carnivore diet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2414
01:54:30.970 --> 01:54:32.750
<v Speaker 2>the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hard now.</v>

2415
01:54:33.080 --> 01:54:35.120
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a calorie restriction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

2416
01:54:35.630 --> 01:54:40.370
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to look at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I give you a plate of French fries,</v>

2417
01:54:40.910 --> 01:54:44.660
<v Speaker 2>like 200 grams of French fries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can get a lot of calories from that.</v>

2418
01:54:44.870 --> 01:54:48.110
<v Speaker 2>If I gave you 200 grams of meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even a real fatty meat,</v>

2419
01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:49.393
<v Speaker 2>it's not nearly the same like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to be much more satiated </v>

2420
01:54:52.311 --> 01:54:53.144
<v Speaker 2>from the protein.</v>

2421
01:54:53.570 --> 01:54:56.280
<v Speaker 2>Like you can only eat so much meat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2422
01:54:56.720 --> 01:54:57.740
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2423
01:54:57.741 --> 01:54:58.574
<v Speaker 2>like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go too far down the </v>

2424
01:55:00.021 --> 01:55:05.021
<v Speaker 2>carnivore diet whole,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the stuff I see with people yet,</v>

2425
01:55:06.260 --> 01:55:08.720
<v Speaker 2>do I think you can eat meat and improve </v>
<v Speaker 2>your blood markers?</v>

2426
01:55:08.990 --> 01:55:10.820
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

2427
01:55:10.970 --> 01:55:12.780
<v Speaker 2>Of course you could eat pop tarts and </v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

2428
01:55:12.980 --> 01:55:14.330
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the point is,</v>

2429
01:55:14.331 --> 01:55:18.020
<v Speaker 2>is like when we get into this kind of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>have only eat meat.</v>

2430
01:55:18.290 --> 01:55:20.320
<v Speaker 2>You don't need vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2431
01:55:21.140 --> 01:55:22.490
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean again,</v>

2432
01:55:22.491 --> 01:55:23.324
<v Speaker 2>it's epidemiology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's some really tight men </v>

2433
01:55:25.371 --> 01:55:30.350
<v Speaker 2>analyses that have been done looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>colorectal cancer and low fiber intake.</v>

2434
01:55:30.680 --> 01:55:31.513
<v Speaker 2>And I would not be comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 2>recommending people not eat enough </v>

2435
01:55:34.971 --> 01:55:35.960
<v Speaker 2>vegetables and fiber.</v>

2436
01:55:36.100 --> 01:55:36.933
<v Speaker 3>I feel uncomfortable eating a steak or a</v>
<v Speaker 3>burger without something like Broccoli </v>

2437
01:55:42.711 --> 01:55:44.550
<v Speaker 3>or a salad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you negate</v>

2438
01:55:44.790 --> 01:55:49.380
<v Speaker 4>many of the potentially carcinogenic </v>
<v Speaker 4>compounds that are in red meat.</v>

2439
01:55:49.470 --> 01:55:51.030
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's a whole nother debate.</v>

2440
01:55:51.210 --> 01:55:53.220
<v Speaker 4>But I think eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2441
01:55:53.221 --> 01:55:54.860
<v Speaker 4>he admired and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

2442
01:55:54.900 --> 01:55:55.733
<v Speaker 4>polyaromatic hydrocarbons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Chris Kresser actually brought that up </v>

2443
01:55:57.960 --> 01:56:01.350
<v Speaker 4>yesterday talking about meat consumption</v>
<v Speaker 4>with vegetables,</v>

2444
01:56:01.860 --> 01:56:04.080
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with brought cruciferous vegetables,</v>

2445
01:56:04.081 --> 01:56:04.914
<v Speaker 4>Broccolis in Salads.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't personally would not eat </v>

2446
01:56:07.441 --> 01:56:08.640
<v Speaker 4>red meat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So full disclosure,</v>

2447
01:56:08.641 --> 01:56:09.474
<v Speaker 4>I mean I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause I get accused on twitter of being </v>

2448
01:56:11.311 --> 01:56:12.144
<v Speaker 4>a car guy and I'm not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was live research was funded by the </v>

2449
01:56:15.781 --> 01:56:18.580
<v Speaker 4>egg board,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the beef beef,</v>

2450
01:56:18.700 --> 01:56:22.260
<v Speaker 4>a national beef something or another.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sorry guys.</v>

2451
01:56:22.350 --> 01:56:25.380
<v Speaker 4>And then the national dairy council,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so you know,</v>

2452
01:56:25.470 --> 01:56:26.303
<v Speaker 4>full disclosure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the way all you guys out there who </v>

2453
01:56:28.530 --> 01:56:29.850
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're just taking my word for it,</v>

2454
01:56:29.851 --> 01:56:30.684
<v Speaker 4>but who think that like industry is this</v>
<v Speaker 4>evil thing that comes in and controls </v>

2455
01:56:34.921 --> 01:56:35.754
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I met one person in my entire phd from </v>

2456
01:56:41.160 --> 01:56:44.010
<v Speaker 4>the funding sources and I met them for </v>
<v Speaker 4>literally 30 seconds.</v>

2457
01:56:44.100 --> 01:56:44.933
<v Speaker 4>They were at a uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was an experimental biology and they </v>

2458
01:56:46.651 --> 01:56:47.910
<v Speaker 4>said hi,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thanks for.</v>

2459
01:56:47.940 --> 01:56:49.830
<v Speaker 4>Thank you for the grant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Great.</v>

2460
01:56:49.831 --> 01:56:50.611
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Great job.</v>

2461
01:56:50.611 --> 01:56:51.690
<v Speaker 4>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was it.</v>

2462
01:56:52.140 --> 01:56:55.290
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm not saying that there isn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>nefarious things that can happen,</v>

2463
01:56:55.291 --> 01:56:58.500
<v Speaker 4>but like when I heard when I like the </v>
<v Speaker 4>show would Nina,</v>

2464
01:56:58.950 --> 01:57:02.130
<v Speaker 4>everything was about who funded it and </v>
<v Speaker 4>this and that and,</v>

2465
01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:05.310
<v Speaker 4>but that's why they have to disclose </v>
<v Speaker 4>those things on papers.</v>

2466
01:57:05.311 --> 01:57:06.144
<v Speaker 4>And also this is why scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>science is self regulating because </v>

2467
01:57:09.211 --> 01:57:10.044
<v Speaker 4>somebody is going to repeat your study </v>
<v Speaker 4>and if they don't find the same thing </v>

2468
01:57:12.571 --> 01:57:13.404
<v Speaker 4>you found you're gonna be in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I get criticized for conflict of </v>

2469
01:57:16.891 --> 01:57:19.080
<v Speaker 4>interest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've seen it on social media and things.</v>

2470
01:57:19.330 --> 01:57:20.163
<v Speaker 4>So I should probably say I am not a </v>
<v Speaker 4>medical doctor or even a registered </v>

2471
01:57:23.551 --> 01:57:24.384
<v Speaker 4>Dietitian and a phd scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so don't take my word is medical or </v>

2472
01:57:28.051 --> 01:57:29.040
<v Speaker 4>nutrition advice.</v>

2473
01:57:29.460 --> 01:57:31.110
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we do.</v>

2474
01:57:31.111 --> 01:57:34.980
<v Speaker 4>Our research is funded not only by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Department of Defense and Office of navy</v>

2475
01:57:34.981 --> 01:57:35.814
<v Speaker 4>research,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also by companies that actually </v>

2476
01:57:37.891 --> 01:57:41.580
<v Speaker 4>develop ketone food products and also </v>
<v Speaker 4>exogenous ketone supplements.</v>

2477
01:57:41.850 --> 01:57:46.560
<v Speaker 4>And our university owns the rights to </v>
<v Speaker 4>those patents.</v>

2478
01:57:46.620 --> 01:57:48.940
<v Speaker 4>I don't have any products myself or </v>
<v Speaker 4>come.</v>

2479
01:57:48.990 --> 01:57:49.823
<v Speaker 4>We have a company,</v>
<v Speaker 4>ketone technologies and Quito nutrition </v>

2480
01:57:51.511 --> 01:57:56.310
<v Speaker 4>has the information website,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at this time we have no products but</v>

2481
01:57:56.311 --> 01:57:57.144
<v Speaker 4>the university licenses our intellectual</v>
<v Speaker 4>property and products are made out of </v>

2482
01:58:01.051 --> 01:58:03.360
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I get patent royalties and I put the</v>

2483
01:58:03.361 --> 01:58:08.040
<v Speaker 4>patent royalties back into our research.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So buying various exogenous ketones,</v>

2484
01:58:08.330 --> 01:58:10.530
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>products that are on the market can come</v>

2485
01:58:10.531 --> 01:58:15.300
<v Speaker 4>back and help support the science and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the application of this for him.</v>

2486
01:58:15.360 --> 01:58:16.500
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2487
01:58:16.760 --> 01:58:18.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tend not to state that,</v>

2488
01:58:18.931 --> 01:58:21.120
<v Speaker 4>but I get called out for not stating </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2489
01:58:21.121 --> 01:58:21.954
<v Speaker 4>So I think it's important to vouch for </v>
<v Speaker 4>him because he's actually writing a </v>

2490
01:58:24.991 --> 01:58:26.070
<v Speaker 4>chapter in my new book.</v>

2491
01:58:26.490 --> 01:58:29.100
<v Speaker 4>So we're going to have a chapter about </v>
<v Speaker 4>the ketogenic diet if you're going to do</v>

2492
01:58:29.101 --> 01:58:30.270
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is how to do it right.</v>

2493
01:58:30.450 --> 01:58:32.040
<v Speaker 4>So the new book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fat loss forever,</v>

2494
01:58:32.100 --> 01:58:33.540
<v Speaker 4>shameless plug,</v>
<v Speaker 4>'em,</v>

2495
01:58:33.870 --> 01:58:34.703
<v Speaker 4>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just want all the money that I make </v>

2496
01:58:38.761 --> 01:58:42.850
<v Speaker 4>from the book to go back into the lab.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So Nice.</v>

2497
01:58:43.210 --> 01:58:47.620
<v Speaker 4>Like that's Walter Longo has a similar </v>
<v Speaker 4>with prolon with his line too.</v>

2498
01:58:47.621 --> 01:58:49.300
<v Speaker 4>I know his profits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

2499
01:58:49.340 --> 01:58:51.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the profits that he takes,</v>

2500
01:58:51.071 --> 01:58:51.904
<v Speaker 4>he puts back into research is unbiased.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anybody that says there are is full of </v>

2501
01:58:54.551 --> 01:58:56.080
<v Speaker 4>crap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We all have our biases.</v>

2502
01:58:56.110 --> 01:58:57.400
<v Speaker 4>We all have things that we think work </v>
<v Speaker 4>better.</v>

2503
01:58:57.401 --> 01:58:58.090
<v Speaker 4>Another.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

2504
01:58:58.090 --> 01:59:00.120
<v Speaker 4>But I think the fundamental,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>

2505
01:59:00.160 --> 01:59:00.993
<v Speaker 4>if you meet a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and hopefully I equip myself well in </v>

2506
01:59:03.761 --> 01:59:06.730
<v Speaker 4>this and I think dom does as well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that one,</v>

2507
01:59:06.731 --> 01:59:07.564
<v Speaker 4>you have an open mind but not so open </v>
<v Speaker 4>that your brain falls out and to you </v>

2508
01:59:11.201 --> 01:59:13.750
<v Speaker 4>care more about getting the right answer</v>
<v Speaker 4>than being right.</v>

2509
01:59:14.080 --> 01:59:17.770
<v Speaker 4>When I went to do my phd,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was eating eight meals a day.</v>

2510
01:59:18.130 --> 01:59:18.963
<v Speaker 4>I was eating 300 grams of protein a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was looking for more reasons to eat </v>

2511
01:59:22.031 --> 01:59:25.270
<v Speaker 4>more protein and eat it more frequently </v>
<v Speaker 4>when I left my phd,</v>

2512
01:59:25.470 --> 01:59:30.470
<v Speaker 4>four meals a day and a little bit less </v>
<v Speaker 4>protein and less frequently.</v>

2513
01:59:31.210 --> 01:59:36.210
<v Speaker 4>And your fractory to the phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're always eating 500 grams of protein</v>

2514
01:59:37.181 --> 01:59:39.100
<v Speaker 4>a day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was eating like two or three,</v>

2515
01:59:39.101 --> 01:59:43.640
<v Speaker 4>two pound London broils and washing it </v>
<v Speaker 4>down with a product metrics with hmb and</v>

2516
01:59:43.641 --> 01:59:44.474
<v Speaker 4>it like in between meals back in the mid</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] 90 [inaudible] and that was </v>

2517
01:59:48.851 --> 01:59:49.720
<v Speaker 4>the coolest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It.</v>

2518
01:59:49.730 --> 01:59:53.200
<v Speaker 4>Well actually that was the coolest thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>about my research was it changed the way</v>

2519
01:59:53.260 --> 01:59:55.760
<v Speaker 4>I actually changed the way I responded,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I was,</v>

2520
01:59:55.810 --> 01:59:57.490
<v Speaker 4>I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was my bias coming in,</v>

2521
01:59:57.491 --> 01:59:59.320
<v Speaker 4>but I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I looked at the research data.</v>

2522
01:59:59.320 --> 02:00:01.060
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>either I believe this or I don't,</v>

2523
02:00:01.070 --> 02:00:04.240
<v Speaker 4>and if I believe this I can't justify x,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Y,</v>

2524
02:00:04.241 --> 02:00:05.330
<v Speaker 4>Z.</v>
<v Speaker 4>can I get.</v>

2525
02:00:05.350 --> 02:00:06.183
<v Speaker 4>Can I go back to the epidemiology </v>
<v Speaker 4>studies in regards to colon and rectal </v>

2526
02:00:09.701 --> 02:00:12.340
<v Speaker 4>cancer?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There really haven't been any studies on</v>

2527
02:00:12.341 --> 02:00:14.680
<v Speaker 4>people that just eat meat though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2528
02:00:14.930 --> 02:00:15.763
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about people who eat meat</v>
<v Speaker 4>on a regular basis and that usually is </v>

2529
02:00:18.831 --> 02:00:19.664
<v Speaker 4>the standard American diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of other bullshit and their sugar </v>

2530
02:00:22.101 --> 02:00:23.870
<v Speaker 4>bonds and there's tons of the co </v>
<v Speaker 4>founders.</v>

2531
02:00:24.460 --> 02:00:25.293
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would be fascinated to see some sort </v>

2532
02:00:29.351 --> 02:00:33.130
<v Speaker 4>of long term studies on someone who's on</v>
<v Speaker 4>a very strict carnivore diet.</v>

2533
02:00:33.490 --> 02:00:34.323
<v Speaker 4>I'm really fascinated by this because </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm seeing all these people have all </v>

2534
02:00:37.001 --> 02:00:39.130
<v Speaker 4>these benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I am skeptical.</v>

2535
02:00:39.131 --> 02:00:41.100
<v Speaker 4>Hippo face every step of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2536
02:00:41.140 --> 02:00:42.430
<v Speaker 4>I'm not know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

2537
02:00:42.431 --> 02:00:44.890
<v Speaker 4>if it's allowing them to create a </v>
<v Speaker 4>caloric restriction.</v>

2538
02:00:45.110 --> 02:00:46.540
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and somebody says,</v>

2539
02:00:46.541 --> 02:00:48.730
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've tried every other diet out there.</v>

2540
02:00:49.080 --> 02:00:51.670
<v Speaker 4>I've tried to eat high fiber and I've </v>
<v Speaker 4>tried enough vegetables.</v>

2541
02:00:51.671 --> 02:00:54.370
<v Speaker 4>I kept,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I can stick to this and I can create</v>

2542
02:00:54.380 --> 02:00:57.070
<v Speaker 4>and I can lose some fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then I want to say,</v>

2543
02:00:57.071 --> 02:00:58.780
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well maybe that's the best diet for you.</v>

2544
02:00:58.890 --> 02:00:59.723
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just know so many people that are </v>

2545
02:01:00.371 --> 02:01:01.980
<v Speaker 4>benefiting from it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a,</v>

2546
02:01:02.080 --> 02:01:02.671
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and,</v>

2547
02:01:02.671 --> 02:01:04.750
<v Speaker 4>and not just a part of that on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>podcast.</v>

2548
02:01:04.751 --> 02:01:05.584
<v Speaker 4>So far I know a lot of other people and </v>
<v Speaker 4>if the members followed by a doctor and </v>

2549
02:01:08.231 --> 02:01:09.064
<v Speaker 4>collecting blood work along the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean those doctors can write case </v>

2550
02:01:11.921 --> 02:01:12.754
<v Speaker 4>reports so I'd be glad to assist in a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in a case report of people are tracking </v>

2551
02:01:16.271 --> 02:01:19.810
<v Speaker 4>all their blood markers and doing there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but most of the people aren't though.</v>

2552
02:01:20.140 --> 02:01:20.950
<v Speaker 4>That's what's going on.</v>

2553
02:01:20.950 --> 02:01:21.783
<v Speaker 4>Most of these knuckleheads are just </v>
<v Speaker 4>eating meat and saying they feel great </v>

2554
02:01:23.711 --> 02:01:28.711
<v Speaker 4>and well there's a war on vegetables.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like fucking very strange.</v>

2555
02:01:29.500 --> 02:01:33.190
<v Speaker 4>Remember that people don't discount </v>
<v Speaker 4>psychology.</v>

2556
02:01:33.250 --> 02:01:36.100
<v Speaker 4>People are feeling very positively about</v>
<v Speaker 4>it because it's the flavor of the month.</v>

2557
02:01:36.260 --> 02:01:37.093
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2558
02:01:37.100 --> 02:01:39.950
<v Speaker 4>and I have no hate towards carnivore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know who the.</v>

2559
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:44.120
<v Speaker 4>I think Dr Baker Zombie one big guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2560
02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:47.540
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if I eat hot dogs,</v>

2561
02:01:47.541 --> 02:01:50.090
<v Speaker 4>eat grass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean my dogs go out and eat around the</v>

2562
02:01:50.091 --> 02:01:50.800
<v Speaker 4>grant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2563
02:01:50.800 --> 02:01:54.350
<v Speaker 4>to get some cat cats are obligate </v>
<v Speaker 4>carnivores.</v>

2564
02:01:54.351 --> 02:01:56.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So cats interestingly are one thing that</v>

2565
02:01:56.591 --> 02:01:57.340
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't.</v>

2566
02:01:57.340 --> 02:01:59.480
<v Speaker 4>There is a carb tolerance within.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't tolerate them well.</v>

2567
02:01:59.481 --> 02:02:02.480
<v Speaker 4>They'll become obese.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the Vegan cat.</v>

2568
02:02:03.290 --> 02:02:05.820
<v Speaker 4>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the.</v>

2569
02:02:06.740 --> 02:02:11.740
<v Speaker 4>I think the thing is that I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe in any one diet.</v>

2570
02:02:12.360 --> 02:02:13.193
<v Speaker 4>I'm not trying to sell anyone dot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would like to sell you on a ketogenic </v>

2571
02:02:16.011 --> 02:02:16.280
<v Speaker 4>diet.</v>

2572
02:02:16.280 --> 02:02:17.113
<v Speaker 4>I really want to see you do it for like </v>
<v Speaker 4>four or five months just to see if </v>

2573
02:02:18.981 --> 02:02:20.660
<v Speaker 4>you're experiencing the same benefits as</v>
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>

2574
02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:24.350
<v Speaker 4>Pretty obvious that you really haven't </v>
<v Speaker 4>done it like whole hog.</v>

2575
02:02:24.500 --> 02:02:26.360
<v Speaker 4>I agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Totally.</v>

2576
02:02:26.361 --> 02:02:28.610
<v Speaker 4>And I think I could probably put </v>
<v Speaker 4>together a meal plan,</v>

2577
02:02:28.930 --> 02:02:30.680
<v Speaker 4>Quito,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cookies and things like that.</v>

2578
02:02:30.681 --> 02:02:34.540
<v Speaker 4>Where you thinking cookies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My cookies.</v>

2579
02:02:35.100 --> 02:02:36.280
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I technically like,</v>

2580
02:02:36.430 --> 02:02:37.700
<v Speaker 4>hang on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hang on.</v>

2581
02:02:38.090 --> 02:02:38.923
<v Speaker 4>See?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did a ketogenetic diet and it was </v>

2582
02:02:40.821 --> 02:02:42.770
<v Speaker 4>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I felt fine about two months.</v>

2583
02:02:42.771 --> 02:02:45.200
<v Speaker 4>Didn't stuff suffer that much?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was your blood markers?</v>

2584
02:02:45.740 --> 02:02:48.020
<v Speaker 4>They didn't really change a whole lot </v>
<v Speaker 4>like I had.</v>

2585
02:02:48.050 --> 02:02:48.883
<v Speaker 4>I think some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would consider them insignificant </v>

2586
02:02:50.511 --> 02:02:53.110
<v Speaker 4>changes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I maintained um,</v>

2587
02:02:53.400 --> 02:02:55.820
<v Speaker 4>about your millimoles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My melanoma.</v>

2588
02:02:55.850 --> 02:02:56.683
<v Speaker 4>Do Urine Ketones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>blood ketones or did you look at my </v>

2589
02:02:59.091 --> 02:02:59.720
<v Speaker 4>blood?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't.</v>

2590
02:02:59.720 --> 02:03:01.750
<v Speaker 4>I didn't measure those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2591
02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:04.100
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just am your instincts.</v>

2592
02:03:04.570 --> 02:03:05.403
<v Speaker 4>And what stage were you in from moderate</v>
<v Speaker 4>to high in terms of would have been the </v>

2593
02:03:09.201 --> 02:03:12.770
<v Speaker 4>modified ketogenic diet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I would have been not super,</v>

2594
02:03:12.860 --> 02:03:15.990
<v Speaker 4>but I would have been barely ketosis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2595
02:03:16.340 --> 02:03:17.600
<v Speaker 4>I would have been above point Tom </v>
<v Speaker 4>Wednesday.</v>

2596
02:03:18.470 --> 02:03:19.303
<v Speaker 4>So he's eight weeks into it and that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>about the point I was kinda feeling </v>

2597
02:03:22.491 --> 02:03:23.560
<v Speaker 4>crummy and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But.</v>

2598
02:03:23.570 --> 02:03:24.280
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2599
02:03:24.280 --> 02:03:26.810
<v Speaker 4>so I actually ended up three,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well not crummy,</v>

2600
02:03:26.811 --> 02:03:29.450
<v Speaker 4>but I cognitively,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was kicking in.</v>

2601
02:03:29.480 --> 02:03:30.313
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I was a political flag and the gym </v>

2602
02:03:32.690 --> 02:03:35.900
<v Speaker 4>and then it started to fill out and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a learning curve too.</v>

2603
02:03:35.990 --> 02:03:36.823
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's see.</v>

2604
02:03:36.890 --> 02:03:39.130
<v Speaker 4>My thing was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if I can get the same,</v>

2605
02:03:39.170 --> 02:03:40.003
<v Speaker 4>if I can get the same benefits just by </v>
<v Speaker 4>restricting my calories and keeping </v>

2606
02:03:42.771 --> 02:03:43.604
<v Speaker 4>higher protein,</v>
<v Speaker 4>same fence in terms of cognitive </v>

2607
02:03:45.861 --> 02:03:47.270
<v Speaker 4>function,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in terms of.</v>

2608
02:03:47.450 --> 02:03:48.920
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well that's science.</v>

2609
02:03:49.070 --> 02:03:51.200
<v Speaker 4>I would say.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we study,</v>

2610
02:03:51.201 --> 02:03:52.034
<v Speaker 4>you could look at pub med,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything from polycystic ovary </v>

2611
02:03:54.711 --> 02:03:56.670
<v Speaker 4>syndrome to acne,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2612
02:03:56.671 --> 02:03:58.520
<v Speaker 4>type two diabetes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>type one diabetes.</v>

2613
02:03:58.520 --> 02:04:03.350
<v Speaker 4>Now that's a little bit controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a genetic metabolic Migraines,</v>

2614
02:04:03.351 --> 02:04:04.184
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a whole host of neurological disorders </v>

2615
02:04:06.291 --> 02:04:07.124
<v Speaker 4>simply because Beta hydroxybutyrate is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe sort of from there is an </v>

2616
02:04:12.141 --> 02:04:15.140
<v Speaker 4>objective truth that it's a superior </v>
<v Speaker 4>metabolic fuel and if,</v>

2617
02:04:15.141 --> 02:04:17.420
<v Speaker 4>how do you define nearly molar levels in</v>
<v Speaker 4>your blood,</v>

2618
02:04:17.690 --> 02:04:21.020
<v Speaker 4>that's a significant amount of energy in</v>
<v Speaker 4>your blood that your tissues can use.</v>

2619
02:04:21.080 --> 02:04:22.820
<v Speaker 4>How are you defining severe metabolic </v>
<v Speaker 4>fuel?</v>

2620
02:04:23.470 --> 02:04:28.340
<v Speaker 4>The objective of the Delta g of ATP </v>
<v Speaker 4>hydrolysis in the heart is enhanced.</v>

2621
02:04:28.341 --> 02:04:32.000
<v Speaker 4>So essentially you're making more ATP </v>
<v Speaker 4>for a given amount of oxygen,</v>

2622
02:04:32.150 --> 02:04:34.730
<v Speaker 4>just protecting your metabolic rate </v>
<v Speaker 4>could be slower.</v>

2623
02:04:35.030 --> 02:04:38.070
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe you are</v>

2624
02:04:39.050 --> 02:04:40.130
<v Speaker 3>efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2625
02:04:40.170 --> 02:04:42.420
<v Speaker 3>so you're more metabolically efficient </v>
<v Speaker 3>potentially,</v>

2626
02:04:42.421 --> 02:04:44.880
<v Speaker 3>but I don't think in the context of fat </v>
<v Speaker 3>loss,</v>

2627
02:04:44.881 --> 02:04:49.440
<v Speaker 3>but it's also enhancing insulin </v>
<v Speaker 3>sensitivity and simply feeding ketones.</v>

2628
02:04:49.750 --> 02:04:50.583
<v Speaker 3>A independent of carbohydrate </v>
<v Speaker 3>restriction increases fat oxidation in </v>

2629
02:04:54.031 --> 02:04:55.500
<v Speaker 3>the muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those had been published.</v>

2630
02:04:55.530 --> 02:04:56.363
<v Speaker 3>There's bits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's been studies to look at like a </v>

2631
02:04:58.081 --> 02:05:01.140
<v Speaker 3>ketogenetic diet versus a knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 3>eugenic higher carb diet,</v>

2632
02:05:01.950 --> 02:05:02.783
<v Speaker 3>and they show that basically by going </v>
<v Speaker 3>kidogenic you reduce overall insulin </v>

2633
02:05:06.030 --> 02:05:09.180
<v Speaker 3>area under the curve by 20 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was the number they got.</v>

2634
02:05:09.720 --> 02:05:11.880
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I was type one diabetic,</v>

2635
02:05:11.940 --> 02:05:13.380
<v Speaker 3>I would 100 percent do the kidogenic </v>
<v Speaker 3>diet.</v>

2636
02:05:13.500 --> 02:05:15.030
<v Speaker 3>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

2637
02:05:15.270 --> 02:05:17.340
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That this is not controversial.</v>

2638
02:05:17.370 --> 02:05:19.540
<v Speaker 3>This is not medical,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is not medical advice.</v>

2639
02:05:19.600 --> 02:05:21.240
<v Speaker 3>And me personally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually,</v>

2640
02:05:21.241 --> 02:05:23.970
<v Speaker 3>when I used to give talks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would say for these things,</v>

2641
02:05:23.971 --> 02:05:24.804
<v Speaker 3>but if you're a type one diabetic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you want to avoid the ketogenic diet as </v>

2642
02:05:28.231 --> 02:05:30.210
<v Speaker 3>much as possible because there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>diabetic,</v>

2643
02:05:30.330 --> 02:05:31.163
<v Speaker 3>something called Diabetic Ketoacidosis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's like my student Andrew Cute </v>

2644
02:05:34.560 --> 02:05:37.640
<v Speaker 3>neck at USF as if you've also got a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of insulin.</v>

2645
02:05:37.680 --> 02:05:38.513
<v Speaker 3>He has a blog on Keto nutrition.org.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go to it and it's a very detailed </v>

2646
02:05:42.871 --> 02:05:43.704
<v Speaker 3>description about carbohydrate </v>
<v Speaker 3>restriction and managing your blood </v>

2647
02:05:46.861 --> 02:05:50.390
<v Speaker 3>glucose and it goes into really into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>weeds if you want to reset it.</v>

2648
02:05:50.510 --> 02:05:52.920
<v Speaker 3>So can I stop you there though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could you elaborate on that?</v>

2649
02:05:52.921 --> 02:05:55.980
<v Speaker 3>So you used to say that if you are type </v>
<v Speaker 3>one diabetic,</v>

2650
02:05:55.981 --> 02:05:56.814
<v Speaker 3>you wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did because it was very controversial </v>

2651
02:05:58.681 --> 02:06:01.710
<v Speaker 3>territory.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Describe what a diabetic ketoacidosis.</v>

2652
02:06:01.740 --> 02:06:02.573
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you're type one diabetic you make </v>

2653
02:06:05.851 --> 02:06:07.920
<v Speaker 3>little or no insulin at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2654
02:06:07.921 --> 02:06:08.700
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2655
02:06:08.700 --> 02:06:10.860
<v Speaker 3>I guess maybe just going back to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>normal person,</v>

2656
02:06:11.070 --> 02:06:13.590
<v Speaker 3>when they fast or they do the kidogenic </v>
<v Speaker 3>diet,</v>

2657
02:06:13.890 --> 02:06:14.723
<v Speaker 3>it increases fat oxidation in the liver </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that fat oxidation actually </v>

2658
02:06:18.091 --> 02:06:20.790
<v Speaker 3>accumulates Acetol Coa Aa and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>creates ketones,</v>

2659
02:06:20.791 --> 02:06:21.624
<v Speaker 3>acetoacetate and Beta hydroxybutyrate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it curves in the context of insulin </v>

2660
02:06:24.721 --> 02:06:27.000
<v Speaker 3>suppression.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you're still abnormal insulin,</v>

2661
02:06:27.001 --> 02:06:28.860
<v Speaker 3>but it's very low,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2662
02:06:28.950 --> 02:06:31.200
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then when your ketones get elevated,</v>

2663
02:06:31.201 --> 02:06:33.960
<v Speaker 3>you spill some out in the urine and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's how you eliminate them.</v>

2664
02:06:33.990 --> 02:06:35.640
<v Speaker 3>Your muscles,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your brain burns them.</v>

2665
02:06:36.120 --> 02:06:38.450
<v Speaker 3>And if they get really high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a,</v>

2666
02:06:38.490 --> 02:06:41.700
<v Speaker 3>an increase in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a small increase in insulin release</v>

2667
02:06:41.730 --> 02:06:42.563
<v Speaker 3>when your ketones get real high and that</v>
<v Speaker 3>insulin ramps down fat oxidation in the </v>

2668
02:06:46.291 --> 02:06:49.290
<v Speaker 3>liver and decreases ketone production.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

2669
02:06:49.291 --> 02:06:50.124
<v Speaker 3>and there's other things too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't want to get too much into </v>

2670
02:06:51.541 --> 02:06:53.400
<v Speaker 3>the weeds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're a very,</v>

2671
02:06:53.401 --> 02:06:56.220
<v Speaker 3>a normal person is finely tuned to </v>
<v Speaker 3>create,</v>

2672
02:06:56.490 --> 02:06:57.323
<v Speaker 3>to maintain physiological ketones within</v>
<v Speaker 3>a certain range with nutritional </v>

2673
02:07:00.871 --> 02:07:02.580
<v Speaker 3>ketosis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with diabetic,</v>

2674
02:07:02.670 --> 02:07:05.430
<v Speaker 3>a type one diabetes that's completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>thrown out the window.</v>

2675
02:07:05.610 --> 02:07:08.670
<v Speaker 3>So without insulin being there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2676
02:07:08.671 --> 02:07:12.050
<v Speaker 3>the absence of insulin essentially </v>
<v Speaker 3>creates runaway ketogenesis.</v>

2677
02:07:12.060 --> 02:07:12.893
<v Speaker 3>And your ketones become very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very high in the context of very high </v>

2678
02:07:16.261 --> 02:07:17.340
<v Speaker 3>glucose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

2679
02:07:17.370 --> 02:07:19.800
<v Speaker 3>So you have high glucose and high </v>
<v Speaker 3>ketones.</v>

2680
02:07:19.830 --> 02:07:24.240
<v Speaker 3>It creates a metabolic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a disruption.</v>

2681
02:07:24.241 --> 02:07:25.074
<v Speaker 3>It creates an acidotic state and </v>
<v Speaker 3>electrolyte imbalances and coma and </v>

2682
02:07:28.831 --> 02:07:29.664
<v Speaker 3>death,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is not going to happen in people </v>

2683
02:07:31.141 --> 02:07:33.360
<v Speaker 3>who are healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who are just doing a ketogenic diet.</v>

2684
02:07:33.450 --> 02:07:34.200
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

2685
02:07:34.200 --> 02:07:37.960
<v Speaker 3>but is the type one diabetes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>

2686
02:07:38.260 --> 02:07:39.970
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my student,</v>

2687
02:07:40.050 --> 02:07:40.883
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>using his own example because I think </v>

2688
02:07:42.160 --> 02:07:45.280
<v Speaker 3>maybe he was using 20 or 30,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I use of insulin a day,</v>

2689
02:07:45.510 --> 02:07:48.190
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then starts carbohydrate restriction</v>

2690
02:07:48.280 --> 02:07:49.113
<v Speaker 3>and even a modified ketogenic diet and </v>
<v Speaker 3>can reduce that insulin requirement to </v>

2691
02:07:54.430 --> 02:07:55.151
<v Speaker 3>four,</v>
<v Speaker 3>five,</v>

2692
02:07:55.151 --> 02:07:56.080
<v Speaker 3>six.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I use a day.</v>

2693
02:07:56.140 --> 02:08:01.140
<v Speaker 3>So literally knocking it down to 20 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent of what he would have changed in</v>

2694
02:08:01.691 --> 02:08:04.560
<v Speaker 3>your perception when you did not </v>
<v Speaker 3>recommend it a beat.</v>

2695
02:08:04.561 --> 02:08:05.394
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a Harvard study that basically </v>

2696
02:08:06.431 --> 02:08:09.610
<v Speaker 3>looked at a group called type one grit </v>
<v Speaker 3>on facebook.</v>

2697
02:08:09.611 --> 02:08:14.290
<v Speaker 3>There was a group called type one grit </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's got thousands of people who use</v>

2698
02:08:14.291 --> 02:08:15.124
<v Speaker 3>a low carbohydrate approach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not necessarily a ketogenic diet </v>

2699
02:08:18.131 --> 02:08:18.580
<v Speaker 3>approach.</v>

2700
02:08:18.580 --> 02:08:19.690
<v Speaker 3>Some are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2701
02:08:19.691 --> 02:08:24.691
<v Speaker 3>but it's very carbohydrate restricted in</v>
<v Speaker 3>terms of what a doctor,</v>

2702
02:08:25.990 --> 02:08:29.050
<v Speaker 3>an endocrinologist would prescribe for a</v>
<v Speaker 3>type one diabetic.</v>

2703
02:08:29.051 --> 02:08:29.884
<v Speaker 3>It would almost make it look like </v>
<v Speaker 3>suicide to some people and low </v>

2704
02:08:32.441 --> 02:08:36.250
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrate dramatically decreases your</v>
<v Speaker 3>insulin requirements.</v>

2705
02:08:36.580 --> 02:08:37.413
<v Speaker 3>And if you look at your continuous blood</v>
<v Speaker 3>glucose recordings over the course of a </v>

2706
02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:42.880
<v Speaker 3>week,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those numbers are much,</v>

2707
02:08:42.881 --> 02:08:43.714
<v Speaker 3>much tighter and that's going to pay </v>
<v Speaker 3>huge dividends in the long run when it </v>

2708
02:08:46.901 --> 02:08:47.734
<v Speaker 3>comes to a longevity and health span.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know the potential for going </v>

2709
02:08:52.511 --> 02:08:54.550
<v Speaker 3>blind or decreasing your kidney </v>
<v Speaker 3>function,</v>

2710
02:08:54.551 --> 02:08:56.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>buy these huge post prandial spikes.</v>

2711
02:08:57.040 --> 02:08:58.060
<v Speaker 3>Essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're type one day,</v>

2712
02:08:58.090 --> 02:09:01.060
<v Speaker 3>you're always chasing your glucose with </v>
<v Speaker 3>insulin injections,</v>

2713
02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:02.230
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or an insulin pump.</v>

2714
02:09:02.500 --> 02:09:06.990
<v Speaker 3>If you're carbohydrate restricted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're basically not it.</v>

2715
02:09:07.010 --> 02:09:10.630
<v Speaker 3>It's very liberating because you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your dependence on insulin is far,</v>

2716
02:09:10.631 --> 02:09:11.630
<v Speaker 3>far less,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2717
02:09:11.680 --> 02:09:12.513
<v Speaker 3>some controversially,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people have gotten completely off </v>

2718
02:09:15.641 --> 02:09:17.230
<v Speaker 3>of insulin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would not recommend that,</v>

2719
02:09:17.260 --> 02:09:18.610
<v Speaker 3>but some people are actually doing that.</v>

2720
02:09:18.830 --> 02:09:19.940
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2721
02:09:20.170 --> 02:09:21.980
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>highly not recommended.</v>

2722
02:09:21.981 --> 02:09:24.740
<v Speaker 2>I hear this from critics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>critics of the kidogenic diet,</v>

2723
02:09:24.830 --> 02:09:27.620
<v Speaker 2>and this is a BS criticism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The again,</v>

2724
02:09:27.650 --> 02:09:30.170
<v Speaker 2>here's me defending the ketogenic diet </v>
<v Speaker 2>is well,</v>

2725
02:09:30.171 --> 02:09:30.770
<v Speaker 2>you'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll be,</v>

2726
02:09:30.770 --> 02:09:35.770
<v Speaker 2>you'll become a people who are healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll have diabetic ketoacidosis.</v>

2727
02:09:36.290 --> 02:09:38.420
<v Speaker 2>That is not going to happen because by </v>
<v Speaker 2>definition,</v>

2728
02:09:38.421 --> 02:09:41.150
<v Speaker 2>if your ketones are high and your health</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're relatively healthy,</v>

2729
02:09:41.151 --> 02:09:43.850
<v Speaker 2>not type one diabetic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your blood glucose is low.</v>

2730
02:09:44.570 --> 02:09:47.480
<v Speaker 2>It's when both are elevated that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous.</v>

2731
02:09:47.750 --> 02:09:49.670
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you're a type one diabetic,</v>

2732
02:09:49.700 --> 02:09:53.900
<v Speaker 2>like Andrew who are just using a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit of insulin to get that baseline,</v>

2733
02:09:54.200 --> 02:09:55.033
<v Speaker 2>so get your glucose levels down to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>baseline level and then you're using a </v>

2734
02:09:58.131 --> 02:10:01.850
<v Speaker 2>carb restricted diet that creates </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketones while your blood glucose.</v>

2735
02:10:01.851 --> 02:10:06.851
<v Speaker 2>Is that a normal basal level that again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a Dr Medical Advice,</v>

2736
02:10:08.120 --> 02:10:09.650
<v Speaker 2>that should not be dangerous</v>

2737
02:10:09.780 --> 02:10:13.950
<v Speaker 3>right now over the years because he's a </v>
<v Speaker 3>power lifter and he's a super big dude.</v>

2738
02:10:13.951 --> 02:10:16.980
<v Speaker 3>He's like 250 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when he goes to the gym,</v>

2739
02:10:16.981 --> 02:10:17.814
<v Speaker 3>he has learned that he can pulse a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit of insulin and maybe ramp up </v>

2740
02:10:20.581 --> 02:10:23.100
<v Speaker 3>is protein or maybe even take it a </v>
<v Speaker 3>little bit of carbohydrates,</v>

2741
02:10:23.101 --> 02:10:23.934
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the next day he's still doing low carb </v>

2742
02:10:25.681 --> 02:10:28.140
<v Speaker 3>throughout the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he's learned to leverage,</v>

2743
02:10:28.240 --> 02:10:29.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a type one diabetic,</v>

2744
02:10:30.090 --> 02:10:31.050
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2745
02:10:31.051 --> 02:10:32.190
<v Speaker 3>you have that advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2746
02:10:32.191 --> 02:10:33.024
<v Speaker 3>Because you can manipulate for body </v>
<v Speaker 3>composition alterations or things like </v>

2747
02:10:36.471 --> 02:10:37.820
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he,</v>

2748
02:10:37.821 --> 02:10:38.654
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he has learned to adjust his protein to </v>

2749
02:10:40.551 --> 02:10:43.310
<v Speaker 3>maximize his sort of gains and </v>
<v Speaker 3>performance in the gym.</v>

2750
02:10:43.790 --> 02:10:46.730
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but nonetheless he goes from,</v>

2751
02:10:47.090 --> 02:10:51.320
<v Speaker 3>he went from a strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he transitioned to a strategy that would</v>

2752
02:10:51.321 --> 02:10:55.670
<v Speaker 3>be a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd look to be almost suicidal from the</v>

2753
02:10:55.671 --> 02:10:56.504
<v Speaker 3>perspective of an endocrinologist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doctor managing type one to do that </v>

2754
02:10:59.541 --> 02:11:02.870
<v Speaker 3>level of carbohydrate restriction would </v>
<v Speaker 3>be a.</v>

2755
02:11:02.870 --> 02:11:07.250
<v Speaker 3>and now we actually have hard science to</v>
<v Speaker 3>show that that can not only can be done,</v>

2756
02:11:07.490 --> 02:11:08.323
<v Speaker 3>that gets that dramatically decreases </v>
<v Speaker 3>the variability of your blood glucose </v>

2757
02:11:12.620 --> 02:11:16.580
<v Speaker 3>fluctuations throughout the day from a </v>
<v Speaker 3>weekly perspective and your requirements</v>

2758
02:11:16.581 --> 02:11:17.414
<v Speaker 3>for insulin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whenever you could use less insulin to </v>

2759
02:11:19.341 --> 02:11:21.500
<v Speaker 3>manage your blood glucose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a good thing.</v>

2760
02:11:21.710 --> 02:11:25.900
<v Speaker 3>I would say it's very hard for a doctor </v>
<v Speaker 3>to argue against any type.</v>

2761
02:11:25.910 --> 02:11:29.480
<v Speaker 3>Would I be using less insulin and </v>
<v Speaker 3>keeping tighter numbers?</v>

2762
02:11:29.481 --> 02:11:34.330
<v Speaker 3>There's no way to argue against that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if you can follow the Diet so that it</v>

2763
02:11:34.340 --> 02:11:35.740
<v Speaker 3>gets back to adherence again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

2764
02:11:35.770 --> 02:11:36.181
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

2765
02:11:36.181 --> 02:11:39.960
<v Speaker 4>so it's one of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you said,</v>

2766
02:11:39.961 --> 02:11:42.600
<v Speaker 4>I'd like to see you try it and do it </v>
<v Speaker 4>whatnot.</v>

2767
02:11:42.900 --> 02:11:44.460
<v Speaker 4>And you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would probably be fine,</v>

2768
02:11:44.580 --> 02:11:49.290
<v Speaker 4>but I enjoy having a variety of foods </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I enjoy having a variety of fuels as</v>

2769
02:11:49.291 --> 02:11:49.771
<v Speaker 4>well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2770
02:11:49.771 --> 02:11:51.780
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure you do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'd still like to see you try it.</v>

2771
02:11:52.920 --> 02:11:56.550
<v Speaker 4>Like those two are mutually exclusive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>

2772
02:11:56.610 --> 02:11:57.970
<v Speaker 4>But I liked having a scientist</v>

2773
02:11:58.060 --> 02:12:00.820
<v Speaker 3>chapter in his book that's coming out </v>
<v Speaker 3>that we worked,</v>

2774
02:12:00.850 --> 02:12:02.590
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>tea together and uh,</v>

2775
02:12:02.660 --> 02:12:03.493
<v Speaker 3>just took some of the concepts that I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't you find here your preferences </v>

2776
02:12:06.491 --> 02:12:08.680
<v Speaker 3>change as well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in terms of your hunger pangs,</v>

2777
02:12:08.710 --> 02:12:10.840
<v Speaker 3>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't crave sugary foods,</v>

2778
02:12:10.841 --> 02:12:12.520
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you do.</v>

2779
02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:13.810
<v Speaker 3>You like them?</v>

2780
02:12:13.810 --> 02:12:14.643
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at you like I'm getting hungry </v>

2781
02:12:18.730 --> 02:12:20.820
<v Speaker 4>thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

2782
02:12:20.830 --> 02:12:22.570
<v Speaker 4>Give me the sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whereas the pizza,</v>

2783
02:12:22.670 --> 02:12:24.970
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no I don't.</v>

2784
02:12:24.971 --> 02:12:26.140
<v Speaker 4>When did you have for breakfast this </v>
<v Speaker 4>morning?</v>

2785
02:12:26.200 --> 02:12:29.920
<v Speaker 4>What did I have for breakfast spot?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had a steak and eggs.</v>

2786
02:12:31.030 --> 02:12:33.630
<v Speaker 4>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the toast.</v>

2787
02:12:33.940 --> 02:12:34.691
<v Speaker 4>Toast.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

2788
02:12:34.691 --> 02:12:36.000
<v Speaker 4>you son of a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stabbed.</v>

2789
02:12:36.400 --> 02:12:38.230
<v Speaker 4>Stab him in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The face is wrong with you.</v>

2790
02:12:38.231 --> 02:12:39.640
<v Speaker 4>Why don't you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Spike.</v>

2791
02:12:40.470 --> 02:12:44.680
<v Speaker 4>Big serving of nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So lots of energy.</v>

2792
02:12:45.460 --> 02:12:46.020
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2793
02:12:46.020 --> 02:12:46.940
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2794
02:12:47.110 --> 02:12:50.890
<v Speaker 4>it's individual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I want to point out that if somebody</v>

2795
02:12:50.891 --> 02:12:53.260
<v Speaker 4>likes a kid and I've had people do </v>
<v Speaker 4>ketogenic diet,</v>

2796
02:12:53.380 --> 02:12:54.213
<v Speaker 4>I've had people you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get ready for shows and the key to take </v>

2797
02:12:56.110 --> 02:12:59.230
<v Speaker 4>time that why did you put them on </v>
<v Speaker 4>occasion because that's what they liked.</v>

2798
02:12:59.620 --> 02:13:00.131
<v Speaker 4>They were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were,</v>

2799
02:13:00.131 --> 02:13:00.964
<v Speaker 4>they had that preference for that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it got to a point where for some </v>

2800
02:13:03.761 --> 02:13:06.700
<v Speaker 4>people their calories get so low if they</v>
<v Speaker 4>have slow metabolic rates,</v>

2801
02:13:07.120 --> 02:13:11.260
<v Speaker 4>that the level of fat restriction it </v>
<v Speaker 4>would take them to is probably not great</v>

2802
02:13:11.261 --> 02:13:12.094
<v Speaker 4>for hormone levels.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I tended to pull a little bit more </v>

2803
02:13:14.981 --> 02:13:18.460
<v Speaker 4>carb relative to fat and so we didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>start out targeted them as key to Jenny,</v>

2804
02:13:18.461 --> 02:13:21.460
<v Speaker 4>but by the end they were um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

2805
02:13:21.780 --> 02:13:22.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2806
02:13:22.380 --> 02:13:25.260
<v Speaker 3>so you had to resort to something that </v>
<v Speaker 3>actually works.</v>

2807
02:13:25.740 --> 02:13:26.573
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop it,</v>

2808
02:13:27.060 --> 02:13:28.580
<v Speaker 3>stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stop</v>

2809
02:13:28.950 --> 02:13:31.860
<v Speaker 4>Basal metabolic because metabolic </v>
<v Speaker 4>declines.</v>

2810
02:13:31.861 --> 02:13:33.540
<v Speaker 4>You get to a point that you get to a </v>
<v Speaker 4>point,</v>

2811
02:13:33.570 --> 02:13:36.820
<v Speaker 4>especially to get that lean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I'm somebody who's a,</v>

2812
02:13:37.490 --> 02:13:40.140
<v Speaker 4>like again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>more average muscle mass and pretty fast</v>

2813
02:13:40.141 --> 02:13:40.974
<v Speaker 4>metabolism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Usually I had to get down to like under </v>

2814
02:13:43.410 --> 02:13:46.680
<v Speaker 4>2000 calories a day to get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get ready for a show.</v>

2815
02:13:47.040 --> 02:13:50.310
<v Speaker 4>So for me I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had my carbohydrates for briefly under</v>

2816
02:13:50.311 --> 02:13:53.270
<v Speaker 4>100 grams of carbs per day in that show </v>
<v Speaker 4>prep December.</v>

2817
02:13:53.380 --> 02:13:54.213
<v Speaker 4>But I was sober.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was sticking your fingers and </v>

2818
02:13:55.561 --> 02:13:56.394
<v Speaker 4>measuring your glucose in the bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I forget where my theory is that when </v>

2819
02:13:59.731 --> 02:14:02.220
<v Speaker 4>you do that and you carb restrict and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you will,</v>

2820
02:14:02.240 --> 02:14:04.620
<v Speaker 4>you calorie restrict rather and get </v>
<v Speaker 4>down,</v>

2821
02:14:04.650 --> 02:14:05.483
<v Speaker 4>he wants that shit's over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just want to reward yourself as </v>

2822
02:14:08.401 --> 02:14:09.234
<v Speaker 4>often as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when someone comes along with </v>

2823
02:14:10.381 --> 02:14:12.390
<v Speaker 4>something like a key to genic diet and </v>
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>

2824
02:14:12.391 --> 02:14:13.490
<v Speaker 4>no bread,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no pop,</v>

2825
02:14:13.530 --> 02:14:14.970
<v Speaker 4>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just,</v>

2826
02:14:14.971 --> 02:14:16.110
<v Speaker 4>you just don't want to do it.</v>

2827
02:14:16.470 --> 02:14:18.840
<v Speaker 4>You get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you get the same.</v>

2828
02:14:19.620 --> 02:14:20.453
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the adherence and the relapse is the </v>

2829
02:14:22.861 --> 02:14:25.540
<v Speaker 4>same whether it's key to genic or </v>
<v Speaker 4>another diet relapse,</v>

2830
02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:28.510
<v Speaker 4>like regaining weight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

2831
02:14:29.930 --> 02:14:34.930
<v Speaker 4>like Pasta and bread because there's no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no foods actually create.</v>

2832
02:14:35.870 --> 02:14:37.620
<v Speaker 4>They've sent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have great stuff there.</v>

2833
02:14:37.621 --> 02:14:40.950
<v Speaker 4>Waffles are excellent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have like a hamburger buns now.</v>

2834
02:14:41.250 --> 02:14:44.850
<v Speaker 4>Anything I really like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've made sandwiches with their stuff.</v>

2835
02:14:45.220 --> 02:14:47.760
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what knocks me out more than anything of</v>

2836
02:14:47.761 --> 02:14:50.130
<v Speaker 4>Ketosis is just too much meat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2837
02:14:50.420 --> 02:14:51.680
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Genesis,</v>

2838
02:14:52.170 --> 02:14:55.920
<v Speaker 4>that's the one that gets me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

2839
02:14:55.921 --> 02:15:00.921
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kind of go back to that.</v>

2840
02:15:01.321 --> 02:15:04.320
<v Speaker 4>The data is very mixed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

2841
02:15:04.321 --> 02:15:05.154
<v Speaker 4>if we look at the overall data set,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very mixed and all diets have terrible </v>

2842
02:15:08.191 --> 02:15:09.280
<v Speaker 4>adherence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2843
02:15:09.750 --> 02:15:11.970
<v Speaker 4>But a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that's discipline.</v>

2844
02:15:12.690 --> 02:15:13.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we also,</v>

2845
02:15:13.710 --> 02:15:16.140
<v Speaker 4>now we've got some crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to talk about people aren't</v>

2846
02:15:16.141 --> 02:15:17.210
<v Speaker 4>disciplined really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really.</v>

2847
02:15:17.310 --> 02:15:20.820
<v Speaker 4>I really have a giant hard problem,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but how does it know so many disciplined</v>

2848
02:15:20.821 --> 02:15:22.020
<v Speaker 4>people?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I just,</v>

2849
02:15:22.021 --> 02:15:25.350
<v Speaker 4>I feel their momentum and vibration and </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2850
02:15:25.360 --> 02:15:26.193
<v Speaker 4>I just want to concentrate on what </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're doing because all these people </v>

2851
02:15:27.751 --> 02:15:30.300
<v Speaker 4>that can't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like that's contagious.</v>

2852
02:15:30.540 --> 02:15:33.360
<v Speaker 4>You started thinking about people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>can adhere to diets and fall off.</v>

2853
02:15:33.390 --> 02:15:36.630
<v Speaker 4>I get it for you because it's something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you do professionally.</v>

2854
02:15:36.810 --> 02:15:40.290
<v Speaker 4>But I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna make it so for you,</v>

2855
02:15:40.291 --> 02:15:41.124
<v Speaker 4>the ketogenic diet clicks or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or eating more meat clicks that that's </v>

2856
02:15:44.521 --> 02:15:47.380
<v Speaker 4>something that you really enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You like the state you lost.</v>

2857
02:15:47.660 --> 02:15:48.690
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love Pasta.</v>

2858
02:15:48.750 --> 02:15:53.750
<v Speaker 4>It makes discipline easier because the </v>
<v Speaker 4>data doesn't support that.</v>

2859
02:15:56.251 --> 02:15:57.084
<v Speaker 4>It makes discipline easier in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 4>your adherence or in terms of your </v>

2860
02:15:59.911 --> 02:16:01.530
<v Speaker 4>longterm adherence?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Both.</v>

2861
02:16:01.890 --> 02:16:03.570
<v Speaker 4>Both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So but,</v>

2862
02:16:03.571 --> 02:16:04.800
<v Speaker 4>but hang on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hang on.</v>

2863
02:16:04.950 --> 02:16:05.783
<v Speaker 4>For some people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for some people this works better </v>

2864
02:16:09.330 --> 02:16:10.163
<v Speaker 4>because they feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have better adherence for other </v>

2865
02:16:12.991 --> 02:16:15.610
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you say now you've got some people,</v>

2866
02:16:15.611 --> 02:16:16.171
<v Speaker 4>if you say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>

2867
02:16:16.171 --> 02:16:17.990
<v Speaker 4>you can have a cookie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It would,</v>

2868
02:16:18.300 --> 02:16:20.820
<v Speaker 4>it would screw them because they would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would just go crazy.</v>

2869
02:16:21.180 --> 02:16:22.013
<v Speaker 4>But for other people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you allow them more flexibility </v>

2870
02:16:23.730 --> 02:16:24.660
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>adherence improves.</v>

2871
02:16:24.661 --> 02:16:28.620
<v Speaker 4>What I'm saying is we need to give </v>
<v Speaker 4>people all the options on the table,</v>

2872
02:16:28.650 --> 02:16:30.160
<v Speaker 4>not demonize any one</v>

2873
02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:32.620
<v Speaker 5>diet and say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

2874
02:16:32.800 --> 02:16:37.240
<v Speaker 5>maybe you try to figure out what works </v>
<v Speaker 5>for lack of sounding Bro,</v>

2875
02:16:37.390 --> 02:16:40.420
<v Speaker 5>what works for you and what you can </v>
<v Speaker 5>sustain.</v>

2876
02:16:41.050 --> 02:16:43.750
<v Speaker 5>Go from there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but see this is totally in agreement.</v>

2877
02:16:43.800 --> 02:16:45.550
<v Speaker 5>I am as well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you keep saying,</v>

2878
02:16:45.580 --> 02:16:48.640
<v Speaker 5>Ken sustained.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You definitely can sustain more than you</v>

2879
02:16:48.641 --> 02:16:49.474
<v Speaker 5>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The real problem is a giant percentage </v>

2880
02:16:52.061 --> 02:16:53.560
<v Speaker 5>of the people are weak.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

2881
02:16:53.561 --> 02:16:55.450
<v Speaker 5>I would agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess in the 30,</v>

2882
02:16:55.451 --> 02:16:57.850
<v Speaker 5>40 percent people just quit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>give up,</v>

2883
02:16:57.851 --> 02:16:58.684
<v Speaker 5>don't do what they're supposed to do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't do as many reps as it's supposed </v>

2884
02:17:01.241 --> 02:17:02.074
<v Speaker 5>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't work out and take days off just </v>

2885
02:17:03.940 --> 02:17:06.760
<v Speaker 5>because they're lazy and those are the </v>
<v Speaker 5>people that get off the Diet.</v>

2886
02:17:06.761 --> 02:17:08.350
<v Speaker 5>It's a discipline issue more than </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything.</v>

2887
02:17:08.410 --> 02:17:09.243
<v Speaker 3>The that is really big.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think various foods that are </v>

2888
02:17:12.181 --> 02:17:15.000
<v Speaker 3>emerging on the market right now at base</v>
<v Speaker 3>systems,</v>

2889
02:17:15.030 --> 02:17:15.863
<v Speaker 3>Virta health actually has a great app </v>
<v Speaker 3>based system that actually coaches you </v>

2890
02:17:18.601 --> 02:17:21.060
<v Speaker 3>through that and I think that's very </v>
<v Speaker 3>helpful.</v>

2891
02:17:21.150 --> 02:17:21.983
<v Speaker 3>So I think new technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>foods and we'll make it will increase </v>

2892
02:17:26.131 --> 02:17:27.150
<v Speaker 3>adherence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>

2893
02:17:27.151 --> 02:17:27.984
<v Speaker 3>when you have a person who knows and </v>
<v Speaker 3>understands all the health benefits </v>

2894
02:17:30.780 --> 02:17:33.360
<v Speaker 3>associated with nutritional ketosis or </v>
<v Speaker 3>just a low carb,</v>

2895
02:17:33.390 --> 02:17:36.750
<v Speaker 3>I think that can be a motivating factor </v>
<v Speaker 3>to make them stick to the Diet,</v>

2896
02:17:37.350 --> 02:17:39.870
<v Speaker 3>but for a guy like you who's rational </v>
<v Speaker 3>and discipline,</v>

2897
02:17:39.871 --> 02:17:41.970
<v Speaker 3>but people their self destructive and </v>
<v Speaker 3>weak,</v>

2898
02:17:42.360 --> 02:17:47.360
<v Speaker 3>they're going to need a burger and fries</v>
<v Speaker 3>and need to share their choice.</v>

2899
02:17:49.590 --> 02:17:51.420
<v Speaker 3>What's the point of the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversation than the well,</v>

2900
02:17:51.421 --> 02:17:52.254
<v Speaker 3>the part of their conversations to avoid</v>
<v Speaker 3>those motherfuckers because they're </v>

2901
02:17:53.851 --> 02:17:56.100
<v Speaker 3>going to drag you down to their mediocre</v>
<v Speaker 3>level.</v>

2902
02:17:57.920 --> 02:18:01.950
<v Speaker 3>I think you need to sympathize with them</v>
<v Speaker 3>a little bit because I think the market,</v>

2903
02:18:01.951 --> 02:18:06.951
<v Speaker 3>and I think this is a fruitful area for </v>
<v Speaker 3>entrepreneurs to create technologies and</v>

2904
02:18:07.471 --> 02:18:11.700
<v Speaker 3>foods that can actually enhance </v>
<v Speaker 3>adherence to stop eating strategies.</v>

2905
02:18:11.701 --> 02:18:14.220
<v Speaker 3>We know about that too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's a combination.</v>

2906
02:18:14.630 --> 02:18:17.210
<v Speaker 5>How much of it is what you're willing to</v>
<v Speaker 5>accept from yourself.</v>

2907
02:18:17.420 --> 02:18:18.253
<v Speaker 5>If you're.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you are willing to accept this </v>

2908
02:18:19.300 --> 02:18:24.050
<v Speaker 5>seesaw,</v>
<v Speaker 5>obesity thing that so many people get on</v>

2909
02:18:24.110 --> 02:18:27.320
<v Speaker 5>on and off this Yoyo effect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're willing to accept that,</v>

2910
02:18:27.650 --> 02:18:28.483
<v Speaker 5>that's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I just feel like it's a mental </v>

2911
02:18:30.921 --> 02:18:31.940
<v Speaker 5>state.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really do.</v>

2912
02:18:31.941 --> 02:18:32.774
<v Speaker 5>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Once you achieve a certain amount of </v>

2913
02:18:34.071 --> 02:18:36.230
<v Speaker 5>success,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people start sabotaging themselves.</v>

2914
02:18:36.500 --> 02:18:37.333
<v Speaker 5>They start,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they start dwelling on the fact that </v>

2915
02:18:39.111 --> 02:18:41.600
<v Speaker 5>they're doing well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but how long can they sustain this?</v>

2916
02:18:41.770 --> 02:18:46.190
<v Speaker 5>I starts being a big fat mind fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and that's when you say like,</v>

2917
02:18:46.191 --> 02:18:48.230
<v Speaker 5>what's sustainable?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's this data?</v>

2918
02:18:48.231 --> 02:18:51.490
<v Speaker 5>A lot more than you're willing to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>what sustainable is?</v>

2919
02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:52.353
<v Speaker 5>Stove yell a bit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The person out there that's listening </v>

2920
02:18:54.471 --> 02:18:55.910
<v Speaker 5>knows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you know what I mean?</v>

2921
02:18:56.120 --> 02:18:56.953
<v Speaker 5>It's like there's a thing like we're </v>
<v Speaker 5>giving people these fucking escape </v>

2922
02:18:59.930 --> 02:19:01.910
<v Speaker 5>clauses.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're giving them these,</v>

2923
02:19:01.911 --> 02:19:04.010
<v Speaker 5>these,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these parachutes they can pull.</v>

2924
02:19:04.190 --> 02:19:07.670
<v Speaker 5>Don't pull the parachute motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just have a cheat day.</v>

2925
02:19:07.700 --> 02:19:10.100
<v Speaker 5>That's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but don't get off your diet.</v>

2926
02:19:10.101 --> 02:19:11.150
<v Speaker 5>Have a cheat meal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2927
02:19:11.151 --> 02:19:14.150
<v Speaker 5>fucking giant Sunday.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Throw some syrup on that bitch.</v>

2928
02:19:14.151 --> 02:19:16.250
<v Speaker 5>Get that whip cream going.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do it once,</v>

2929
02:19:16.400 --> 02:19:21.400
<v Speaker 5>but don't live your life like that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's nonsense and I think that for.</v>

2930
02:19:22.910 --> 02:19:23.743
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wouldn't disagree with anything you </v>

2931
02:19:24.321 --> 02:19:26.060
<v Speaker 5>said.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People need to hear.</v>

2932
02:19:26.061 --> 02:19:27.590
<v Speaker 5>Not this like this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

2933
02:19:27.591 --> 02:19:28.100
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you</v>

2934
02:19:28.100 --> 02:19:28.933
<v Speaker 2>can't sustain it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Quito giant Sam Houston state to </v>

2935
02:19:31.830 --> 02:19:35.170
<v Speaker 2>state their control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you do sustainable,</v>

2936
02:19:35.270 --> 02:19:36.103
<v Speaker 2>if you found for three days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that will give you a lot of confidence </v>

2937
02:19:38.541 --> 02:19:41.750
<v Speaker 2>that you have control over food fasting </v>
<v Speaker 2>for three days.</v>

2938
02:19:41.751 --> 02:19:42.584
<v Speaker 2>No Diet is sustainable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not sustainable over if you look </v>

2939
02:19:44.931 --> 02:19:45.764
<v Speaker 2>for the general population and you get a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of weak bitches and you get them </v>

2940
02:19:48.621 --> 02:19:49.454
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many of them are going to keep it </v>

2941
02:19:50.061 --> 02:19:50.894
<v Speaker 2>together?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many of them are going to run </v>

2942
02:19:51.111 --> 02:19:51.944
<v Speaker 2>everyday?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many of you going to work out every </v>

2943
02:19:52.491 --> 02:19:53.301
<v Speaker 2>day?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>

2944
02:19:53.301 --> 02:19:54.230
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very few.</v>

2945
02:19:54.231 --> 02:19:56.450
<v Speaker 2>You're dealing with outliers in </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular.</v>

2946
02:19:56.570 --> 02:19:57.403
<v Speaker 2>Just by virtue of what you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many people are willing to put the </v>

2947
02:20:00.261 --> 02:20:03.710
<v Speaker 2>work in to achieve this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That not how many,</v>

2948
02:20:04.070 --> 02:20:05.450
<v Speaker 2>how many people are gonna achieve this </v>
<v Speaker 2>physique?</v>

2949
02:20:05.600 --> 02:20:06.980
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very few.</v>

2950
02:20:06.981 --> 02:20:09.380
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're talking about outliers.</v>

2951
02:20:09.560 --> 02:20:10.393
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about how.</v>

2952
02:20:10.460 --> 02:20:12.320
<v Speaker 2>That's what I like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like outliers.</v>

2953
02:20:12.470 --> 02:20:17.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't like people that are good to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hear that that's dangerous,</v>

2954
02:20:18.620 --> 02:20:19.453
<v Speaker 2>so like that shit is worse than carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why we talk a lot in the book </v>

2955
02:20:22.911 --> 02:20:26.060
<v Speaker 2>about behaviors because if you change </v>
<v Speaker 2>your behavior,</v>

2956
02:20:26.510 --> 02:20:27.343
<v Speaker 2>that's what we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's not enough research </v>

2957
02:20:28.971 --> 02:20:29.804
<v Speaker 2>focused on is let's look at the people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who actually achieve weight loss and if </v>

2958
02:20:33.591 --> 02:20:35.210
<v Speaker 2>you look at people who achieve it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>keep it off,</v>

2959
02:20:35.510 --> 02:20:37.040
<v Speaker 2>they do it through many different </v>
<v Speaker 2>methods,</v>

2960
02:20:37.041 --> 02:20:38.510
<v Speaker 2>whether it's low carb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>low fat,</v>

2961
02:20:38.540 --> 02:20:39.373
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's look at the behaviors that </v>

2962
02:20:41.691 --> 02:20:44.600
<v Speaker 2>they make and those behaviors can tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>us a lot about people.</v>

2963
02:20:44.601 --> 02:20:45.434
<v Speaker 2>One thing we know is they practice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've made themselves very often they </v>

2964
02:20:50.120 --> 02:20:50.953
<v Speaker 2>so they're accountable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They practice some form of cognitive </v>

2965
02:20:54.111 --> 02:20:55.850
<v Speaker 2>restraint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's weighing food,</v>

2966
02:20:55.851 --> 02:20:58.970
<v Speaker 2>recording macros,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ketogenic fat restriction,</v>

2967
02:20:58.971 --> 02:20:59.804
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and also they exercise regularly and </v>

2968
02:21:03.740 --> 02:21:04.573
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's physiological benefits to that </v>

2969
02:21:05.541 --> 02:21:09.440
<v Speaker 2>exercise lowers the body fat set point </v>
<v Speaker 2>that your body will defend.</v>

2970
02:21:09.920 --> 02:21:11.720
<v Speaker 2>So it actually has a physiological </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefit,</v>

2971
02:21:12.020 --> 02:21:15.260
<v Speaker 2>but also just mentally like you said.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I never.</v>

2972
02:21:15.261 --> 02:21:17.960
<v Speaker 2>If you took me back 30 years ago and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>told me,</v>

2973
02:21:18.470 --> 02:21:18.920
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>les,</v>

2974
02:21:18.920 --> 02:21:20.690
<v Speaker 2>or when I was 10 years old and you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2975
02:21:20.930 --> 02:21:23.540
<v Speaker 2>when I was bullied and picked on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had no self esteem,</v>

2976
02:21:23.960 --> 02:21:24.793
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna fucking squat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>668 pounds one day on your back at 201 </v>

2977
02:21:29.361 --> 02:21:32.330
<v Speaker 2>pounds and set a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been broken since then,</v>

2978
02:21:32.331 --> 02:21:34.610
<v Speaker 2>but a world record,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have been like,</v>

2979
02:21:34.820 --> 02:21:36.980
<v Speaker 2>there's no fucking way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way,</v>

2980
02:21:37.280 --> 02:21:41.210
<v Speaker 2>but when you have disciplined like you </v>
<v Speaker 2>said and you that doesn't,</v>

2981
02:21:41.211 --> 02:21:43.130
<v Speaker 2>just people say you should have more </v>
<v Speaker 2>confidence.</v>

2982
02:21:43.430 --> 02:21:47.180
<v Speaker 2>That's a fucking horseshit advice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Confidence is built through.</v>

2983
02:21:47.360 --> 02:21:48.193
<v Speaker 2>You set a goal and you achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You set a goal and achieve it and you </v>

2984
02:21:50.331 --> 02:21:51.164
<v Speaker 2>don't start out to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to set a world record and </v>

2985
02:21:52.941 --> 02:21:53.930
<v Speaker 2>that's your first goal.</v>

2986
02:21:54.440 --> 02:21:55.340
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like,</v>

2987
02:21:55.341 --> 02:21:56.174
<v Speaker 2>what will Smith say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say you lay a brick as perfectly as you </v>

2988
02:21:57.921 --> 02:21:58.754
<v Speaker 2>can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lay it.</v>

2989
02:21:58.910 --> 02:21:59.743
<v Speaker 2>You do it again and you do it again and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you do it again and you talked to </v>

2990
02:22:02.180 --> 02:22:06.350
<v Speaker 2>anybody who's successful in anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't start out saying,</v>

2991
02:22:06.950 --> 02:22:09.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do this earth shattering </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing right?</v>

2992
02:22:09.890 --> 02:22:10.723
<v Speaker 2>They started out and built that </v>
<v Speaker 2>confidence over years and years of </v>

2993
02:22:14.450 --> 02:22:17.210
<v Speaker 2>achieving small goals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which then led them to their big goal.</v>

2994
02:22:17.211 --> 02:22:18.044
<v Speaker 2>Now we're onto something because I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the mental state in which you </v>

2995
02:22:20.151 --> 02:22:22.160
<v Speaker 2>approach anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a workout routine,</v>

2996
02:22:22.190 --> 02:22:24.350
<v Speaker 2>a lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way you decide to live your life,</v>

2997
02:22:24.351 --> 02:22:26.940
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and here's one of the things that people</v>

2998
02:22:26.941 --> 02:22:27.774
<v Speaker 2>are cynical about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably one of the best sources </v>

2999
02:22:30.091 --> 02:22:30.924
<v Speaker 2>of fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is inspiration from other motivated </v>

3000
02:22:33.001 --> 02:22:33.834
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go to David Goggins instagram page </v>

<v Speaker 2>he's awesome,</v>

<v Speaker 2>but go to people like him.</v>

3004
02:22:42.210 --> 02:22:43.043
<v Speaker 2>Cameron Hanes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to go to go to the rock like these </v>

3005
02:22:46.141 --> 02:22:47.940
<v Speaker 2>fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just do it.</v>

3006
02:22:48.180 --> 02:22:51.270
<v Speaker 2>There's no escape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no acute sustain that.</v>

3007
02:22:51.300 --> 02:22:53.100
<v Speaker 2>That's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to hear that shit.</v>

3008
02:22:53.460 --> 02:22:55.170
<v Speaker 2>That's nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Failing is good.</v>

3009
02:22:55.171 --> 02:22:56.220
<v Speaker 2>It's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you fail,</v>

3010
02:22:57.330 --> 02:22:59.140
<v Speaker 2>then you're not going to get back on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>horse.</v>

3011
02:22:59.141 --> 02:23:03.240
<v Speaker 2>You're not pushing yourself hard enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I say sustainability,</v>

3012
02:23:03.690 --> 02:23:04.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's,</v>

3013
02:23:04.800 --> 02:23:07.920
<v Speaker 2>if it's because everybody has stuff that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they find,</v>

3014
02:23:07.921 --> 02:23:08.754
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find a carb restricted diet to be </v>

3015
02:23:10.171 --> 02:23:12.650
<v Speaker 2>easier to stick to three feels better </v>
<v Speaker 2>for it,</v>

3016
02:23:12.820 --> 02:23:14.280
<v Speaker 2>better for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's fine,</v>

3017
02:23:14.520 --> 02:23:16.410
<v Speaker 2>but if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if somebody is over here and says,</v>

3018
02:23:16.411 --> 02:23:17.820
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm eating a low fat diet.</v>

3019
02:23:17.910 --> 02:23:19.860
<v Speaker 2>I feel great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My blood markers are good.</v>

3020
02:23:19.920 --> 02:23:22.740
<v Speaker 2>I have plenty of energy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's wrong with that?</v>

3021
02:23:22.950 --> 02:23:26.270
<v Speaker 2>Nothing's wrong with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's well Libertarian,</v>

3022
02:23:26.380 --> 02:23:28.770
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unquestionably exists,</v>

3023
02:23:28.830 --> 02:23:29.430
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's A.</v>

3024
02:23:29.430 --> 02:23:31.220
<v Speaker 2>There's a giant difference between all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of this.</v>

3025
02:23:31.260 --> 02:23:33.090
<v Speaker 2>Some people eat peanuts and they die,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3026
02:23:33.190 --> 02:23:34.450
<v Speaker 2>We all know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just.</v>

3027
02:23:34.680 --> 02:23:36.300
<v Speaker 2>The body's just very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very different.</v>

3028
02:23:36.301 --> 02:23:39.120
<v Speaker 2>They're very exactly their caloric </v>
<v Speaker 2>requirements,</v>

3029
02:23:39.260 --> 02:23:41.540
<v Speaker 2>the nutritional requirements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3030
02:23:41.550 --> 02:23:42.840
<v Speaker 2>That's what's hard about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3031
02:23:42.870 --> 02:23:47.040
<v Speaker 2>Is Finding this one thing that is best </v>
<v Speaker 2>for you.</v>

3032
02:23:47.210 --> 02:23:49.500
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And objectively and you know,</v>

3033
02:23:49.501 --> 02:23:53.010
<v Speaker 2>and being really analyzing your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your actual physical performance,</v>

3034
02:23:53.011 --> 02:23:54.720
<v Speaker 2>which very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very few people do.</v>

3035
02:23:54.870 --> 02:23:55.651
<v Speaker 2>They kind of say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3036
02:23:55.651 --> 02:23:57.780
<v Speaker 2>I feel pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but by what marker,</v>

3037
02:23:57.830 --> 02:23:58.440
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you,</v>

3038
02:23:58.440 --> 02:24:01.200
<v Speaker 2>what's your personal best?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you trying to accomplish?</v>

3039
02:24:01.201 --> 02:24:03.700
<v Speaker 2>Are you monitoring your heart rate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you monitoring your workout?</v>

3040
02:24:03.701 --> 02:24:07.230
<v Speaker 2>Put like what are you doing to show that</v>
<v Speaker 2>this diet is optimal for you?</v>

3041
02:24:07.540 --> 02:24:08.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3042
02:24:08.731 --> 02:24:10.110
<v Speaker 2>and part of that is like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3043
02:24:10.410 --> 02:24:11.243
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to get a lot of money that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be spent to get that data for </v>

3044
02:24:15.541 --> 02:24:16.110
<v Speaker 2>an individual.</v>

3045
02:24:16.110 --> 02:24:19.440
<v Speaker 2>So part of it is going to have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you feel good on and what do you</v>

3046
02:24:19.441 --> 02:24:20.274
<v Speaker 2>feel like is again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most sustainable for you because no </v>

3047
02:24:24.241 --> 02:24:28.020
<v Speaker 2>matter what that people want to diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what people really want is they want,</v>

3048
02:24:28.290 --> 02:24:29.123
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to have to track and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't wanna have to sacrifice anything </v>

3049
02:24:31.500 --> 02:24:32.940
<v Speaker 2>and I want to get to my goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3050
02:24:32.970 --> 02:24:34.050
<v Speaker 2>tough shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not going to happen.</v>

3051
02:24:34.500 --> 02:24:36.150
<v Speaker 2>You have to pick what you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>sacrifice,</v>

3052
02:24:36.151 --> 02:24:37.410
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you say,</v>

3053
02:24:37.440 --> 02:24:41.650
<v Speaker 2>I hate tracking calories so I'm just not</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to eat carbs because I,</v>

3054
02:24:41.651 --> 02:24:44.520
<v Speaker 2>I can regulate my body weight that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah,</v>

3055
02:24:44.521 --> 02:24:45.354
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a post on twitter that was one of </v>

3056
02:24:46.901 --> 02:24:48.480
<v Speaker 2>my most popular twitter posts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

3057
02:24:48.870 --> 02:24:49.703
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>health improvements are largely driven </v>

3058
02:24:51.331 --> 02:24:55.150
<v Speaker 2>by caloric restriction and weight loss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if,</v>

3059
02:24:55.480 --> 02:24:59.190
<v Speaker 2>if you like Vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you like Quito Carnivore,</v>

3060
02:24:59.220 --> 02:25:03.450
<v Speaker 2>if you and I just listed a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>different diets and they help you create</v>

3061
02:25:03.451 --> 02:25:06.330
<v Speaker 2>a restriction and it keeps you at a </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthy weight,</v>

3062
02:25:07.110 --> 02:25:08.400
<v Speaker 2>then fuck yeah.</v>

3063
02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:10.920
<v Speaker 2>Hell yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if somebody says,</v>

3064
02:25:10.921 --> 02:25:13.590
<v Speaker 2>I like eating a Vegan Diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not interested in losing weight,</v>

3065
02:25:13.591 --> 02:25:16.410
<v Speaker 2>but Ketogenic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intermittent fasting is very,</v>

3066
02:25:16.411 --> 02:25:17.244
<v Speaker 2>very easy for me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I loved the food and I feel better and </v>

3067
02:25:19.761 --> 02:25:20.594
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think all my biomarkers are improving </v>

3068
02:25:22.890 --> 02:25:23.723
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you don't need any other reasoning </v>

3069
02:25:24.550 --> 02:25:26.620
<v Speaker 2>for why you should do it with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It works.</v>

3070
02:25:26.860 --> 02:25:27.760
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I ask you this?</v>

3071
02:25:27.761 --> 02:25:28.594
<v Speaker 2>When you say diets aren't sustainable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the data doesn't show that what you're </v>

3072
02:25:30.321 --> 02:25:31.154
<v Speaker 2>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calorie restricted diets that overall </v>

3073
02:25:32.590 --> 02:25:35.470
<v Speaker 2>weight loss diets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you talking about dietary choices in</v>

3074
02:25:35.471 --> 02:25:37.990
<v Speaker 2>terms of like key to genic direct </v>
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>

3075
02:25:38.380 --> 02:25:42.670
<v Speaker 2>So it's that if you lose weight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we cannot keep it off.</v>

3076
02:25:42.910 --> 02:25:43.743
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is the big problem is that most </v>

3077
02:25:46.451 --> 02:25:51.280
<v Speaker 2>people are able to lose weight and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>cannot keep it off because one,</v>

3078
02:25:51.320 --> 02:25:55.600
<v Speaker 2>the self defense system that we talked </v>
<v Speaker 2>about is really weight too quickly.</v>

3079
02:25:55.600 --> 02:25:58.510
<v Speaker 2>Their body gets into this state where </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's always trying to regain that weight</v>

3080
02:25:58.511 --> 02:25:59.560
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Part of it,</v>

3081
02:25:59.561 --> 02:26:00.371
<v Speaker 2>part of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3082
02:26:00.371 --> 02:26:04.120
<v Speaker 2>like losing it more quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's debate about this,</v>

3083
02:26:04.121 --> 02:26:09.121
<v Speaker 2>but I would say that it's you have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>create a more extreme deficit to do that</v>

3084
02:26:09.490 --> 02:26:13.270
<v Speaker 2>and so you are activating your body self</v>
<v Speaker 2>defense system more intensely.</v>

3085
02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:14.193
<v Speaker 2>If I had to say it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the rebound is usually bigger as </v>

3086
02:26:16.691 --> 02:26:18.490
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's.</v>

3087
02:26:18.580 --> 02:26:19.413
<v Speaker 2>It's trying to find a way of cake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we get this weight off and then </v>

3088
02:26:22.271 --> 02:26:27.271
<v Speaker 2>let's really emphasize to people that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the diet after the Diet,</v>

3089
02:26:28.480 --> 02:26:31.210
<v Speaker 2>nobody talks about this except for us in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the book.</v>

3090
02:26:32.110 --> 02:26:36.400
<v Speaker 2>Nobody talks about this like co writer </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the book,</v>

3091
02:26:36.430 --> 02:26:37.263
<v Speaker 2>Peter Baker and I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we spent were spent chapters talking </v>

3092
02:26:39.371 --> 02:26:42.340
<v Speaker 2>about when you go and transition into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

3093
02:26:42.341 --> 02:26:44.680
<v Speaker 2>we've lost the weight we want to lose </v>
<v Speaker 2>were healthier.</v>

3094
02:26:45.400 --> 02:26:46.233
<v Speaker 2>You have to have the same amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>discipline and intensity to then </v>

3095
02:26:49.661 --> 02:26:53.020
<v Speaker 2>maintain that loss because if you let </v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

3096
02:26:53.080 --> 02:26:53.913
<v Speaker 2>if you let your foot off the gas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now you don't necessarily have to be at </v>

3097
02:26:56.891 --> 02:26:57.724
<v Speaker 2>the same caloric restriction level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you just let yourself go on a </v>

3098
02:27:01.201 --> 02:27:02.110
<v Speaker 2>vacation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to eat.</v>

3099
02:27:02.230 --> 02:27:03.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat what I want,</v>

3100
02:27:04.350 --> 02:27:05.183
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gained 10 pounds and everybody knows </v>

3101
02:27:06.701 --> 02:27:07.534
<v Speaker 2>people like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who they go and they do this and you've </v>

3102
02:27:09.701 --> 02:27:10.534
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've literally just undid months of </v>

3103
02:27:13.871 --> 02:27:14.704
<v Speaker 2>hard work in one week would say if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>could maintain that for a set amount of </v>

3104
02:27:18.581 --> 02:27:19.720
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say six months.</v>

3105
02:27:19.810 --> 02:27:22.720
<v Speaker 2>So I think that if someone can maintain </v>
<v Speaker 2>that weight loss for six months,</v>

3106
02:27:22.750 --> 02:27:26.440
<v Speaker 2>that's like sort of like the tipping </v>
<v Speaker 2>point where they can go on.</v>

3107
02:27:27.320 --> 02:27:28.740
<v Speaker 2>Got My wheel house right here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go up.</v>

3108
02:27:29.100 --> 02:27:32.230
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's a great point.</v>

3109
02:27:32.231 --> 02:27:33.064
<v Speaker 2>So Leptin as you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you've heard of people talking </v>

3110
02:27:35.801 --> 02:27:37.360
<v Speaker 2>about Leptin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when you lose fat,</v>

3111
02:27:37.390 --> 02:27:38.223
<v Speaker 2>Leptin secretion goes down because fat </v>
<v Speaker 2>cells secrete it and it's Kinda like </v>

3112
02:27:42.131 --> 02:27:43.660
<v Speaker 2>your body's thermostat and body fat.</v>

3113
02:27:43.690 --> 02:27:45.710
<v Speaker 2>Everybody has like a set point their </v>
<v Speaker 2>body likes to be.</v>

3114
02:27:45.711 --> 02:27:46.544
<v Speaker 2>Yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so if you lose body fat used to create </v>

3115
02:27:47.861 --> 02:27:49.510
<v Speaker 2>less Leptin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hunger goes up,</v>

3116
02:27:49.690 --> 02:27:50.523
<v Speaker 2>metabolic rate goes down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Krellan tries to yes and girl is in </v>

3117
02:27:52.781 --> 02:27:54.670
<v Speaker 2>opposition to Leptin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you,</v>

3118
02:27:54.700 --> 02:27:56.800
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is your body like a thermostat,</v>

3119
02:27:56.801 --> 02:28:00.490
<v Speaker 2>so if on a thermostat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you said it's 75 goes to low,</v>

3120
02:28:00.520 --> 02:28:01.840
<v Speaker 2>kick the heat on bumper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back up,</v>

3121
02:28:02.230 --> 02:28:04.720
<v Speaker 2>goes to high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kick the cooling and go back down,</v>

3122
02:28:04.760 --> 02:28:07.030
<v Speaker 2>left and acts that way with your </v>
<v Speaker 2>metabolic rate and your hunger.</v>

3123
02:28:08.290 --> 02:28:11.440
<v Speaker 2>When you get down to a low body fat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Leptin is low,</v>

3124
02:28:11.860 --> 02:28:14.500
<v Speaker 2>your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a drive to regain that weight.</v>

3125
02:28:14.530 --> 02:28:16.590
<v Speaker 2>You're your hungers higher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your boss,</v>

3126
02:28:16.620 --> 02:28:18.790
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your metabolic rate is lower.</v>

3127
02:28:19.840 --> 02:28:22.070
<v Speaker 2>Leptin still stays low even</v>

3128
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:22.903
<v Speaker 4>years after a diet and people who have </v>
<v Speaker 4>kept the weight off so you would think </v>

3129
02:28:29.361 --> 02:28:31.820
<v Speaker 4>there'd still be a biological drive to </v>
<v Speaker 4>regain the weight.</v>

3130
02:28:33.110 --> 02:28:35.480
<v Speaker 4>That said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I'm going to go out on a limb here,</v>

3131
02:28:35.570 --> 02:28:37.820
<v Speaker 4>so any of my scientists who are </v>
<v Speaker 4>listening on this,</v>

3132
02:28:37.821 --> 02:28:40.220
<v Speaker 4>feel free to call me out on the carpet </v>
<v Speaker 4>if you think I'm wrong,</v>

3133
02:28:41.540 --> 02:28:42.373
<v Speaker 4>but just like obese people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obese people actually have high levels </v>

3134
02:28:44.781 --> 02:28:47.420
<v Speaker 4>of Leptin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have high levels of Leptin,</v>

3135
02:28:47.450 --> 02:28:50.420
<v Speaker 4>but they become leptin resistant up to </v>
<v Speaker 4>an insensitive,</v>

3136
02:28:50.450 --> 02:28:52.370
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you stay at a re,</v>

3137
02:28:52.420 --> 02:28:53.253
<v Speaker 4>there is evidence that if you stay at a </v>
<v Speaker 4>reduced body weight for one or two </v>

3138
02:28:55.671 --> 02:28:56.504
<v Speaker 4>years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that can become your new set point </v>

3139
02:28:59.301 --> 02:29:00.134
<v Speaker 4>that your body defense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what can happen is even if your </v>

3140
02:29:01.941 --> 02:29:04.490
<v Speaker 4>Leptin doesn't go out or two years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not six months,</v>

3141
02:29:04.520 --> 02:29:05.720
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a little bit longer,</v>

3142
02:29:05.890 --> 02:29:07.930
<v Speaker 4>a little bit longer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's a good stock aneurysm.</v>

3143
02:29:07.940 --> 02:29:10.070
<v Speaker 4>What's happening?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3144
02:29:10.071 --> 02:29:12.230
<v Speaker 4>I think it's probably multifaceted </v>
<v Speaker 4>because nothing,</v>

3145
02:29:12.260 --> 02:29:15.650
<v Speaker 4>your body is so redundant.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Usually nothing is ever one thing.</v>

3146
02:29:15.710 --> 02:29:16.543
<v Speaker 4>Typically your set point,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think one of the things that happens </v>

3147
02:29:19.731 --> 02:29:23.270
<v Speaker 4>is probably your body becomes more </v>
<v Speaker 4>sensitive to the Leptin you have because</v>

3148
02:29:23.271 --> 02:29:24.104
<v Speaker 4>you're leaner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now I want to talk about performance </v>

3149
02:29:26.360 --> 02:29:27.193
<v Speaker 4>because this is a big thing with </v>
<v Speaker 4>athletes and particularly in my field </v>

3150
02:29:29.991 --> 02:29:30.824
<v Speaker 4>with fighters.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Many of them were reluctant to try </v>

3151
02:29:33.291 --> 02:29:38.291
<v Speaker 4>ketogenic diet initially because of the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first few weeks are pretty rough and</v>

3152
02:29:39.071 --> 02:29:40.130
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it really enhanced,</v>

3153
02:29:40.250 --> 02:29:41.083
<v Speaker 4>inhibits training and you get that Keto </v>
<v Speaker 4>flu feeling and I've experienced that </v>

3154
02:29:44.661 --> 02:29:45.494
<v Speaker 4>too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but overall is the key to genic diet a </v>

3155
02:29:49.461 --> 02:29:50.294
<v Speaker 4>good strategy for someone that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>involved in some sort of a brutal </v>

3156
02:29:54.591 --> 02:29:58.940
<v Speaker 4>athletic pursuit like football or </v>
<v Speaker 4>wrestling.</v>

3157
02:29:59.090 --> 02:30:03.770
<v Speaker 4>It can be absolutely,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it will be dependent upon being keto</v>

3158
02:30:03.771 --> 02:30:08.750
<v Speaker 4>adapted over time and actually training </v>
<v Speaker 4>in a state of Ketosis.</v>

3159
02:30:08.810 --> 02:30:11.000
<v Speaker 4>So you forced those adaptations over </v>
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

3160
02:30:11.001 --> 02:30:14.300
<v Speaker 4>We know that the ketogenic diet is </v>
<v Speaker 4>glycogen sparing overtime.</v>

3161
02:30:14.330 --> 02:30:17.540
<v Speaker 4>Glycolytic pathways will be decreased </v>
<v Speaker 4>over time,</v>

3162
02:30:17.541 --> 02:30:22.520
<v Speaker 4>so that may impair a anaerobic power </v>
<v Speaker 4>output initially,</v>

3163
02:30:22.580 --> 02:30:25.590
<v Speaker 4>but I think that most people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some people,</v>

3164
02:30:26.090 --> 02:30:29.450
<v Speaker 4>I think a good amount of people could </v>
<v Speaker 4>adapt back to,</v>

3165
02:30:29.451 --> 02:30:30.284
<v Speaker 4>especially if they're taking things like</v>
<v Speaker 4>creatine monohydrate and taking various </v>

3166
02:30:32.931 --> 02:30:35.390
<v Speaker 4>supplements that can kind of fill that </v>
<v Speaker 4>gap,</v>

3167
02:30:35.720 --> 02:30:36.553
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to meet the glycolytic anaerobic energy </v>

3168
02:30:39.120 --> 02:30:39.820
<v Speaker 4>demands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3169
02:30:39.820 --> 02:30:41.110
<v Speaker 4>that tighter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3170
02:30:41.350 --> 02:30:42.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Zack bitter,</v>

3171
02:30:42.291 --> 02:30:43.124
<v Speaker 4>who holds the American record for the </v>
<v Speaker 4>fastest 24 hour run or 24 the fastest </v>

3172
02:30:48.861 --> 02:30:53.300
<v Speaker 4>100 mile run.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He did it in an 11 hours and 40 minutes.</v>

3173
02:30:53.310 --> 02:30:55.130
<v Speaker 4>Insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He ran 100 miles.</v>

3174
02:30:55.280 --> 02:30:56.113
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking just nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now she can correspond with him on </v>

3175
02:30:59.181 --> 02:31:00.180
<v Speaker 4>twitter one time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not,</v>

3176
02:31:00.270 --> 02:31:01.790
<v Speaker 4>not by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very,</v>

3177
02:31:02.780 --> 02:31:04.730
<v Speaker 4>very smart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jeff Bolek I think,</v>

3178
02:31:04.731 --> 02:31:06.950
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>brought him to my attention and actually</v>

3179
02:31:06.951 --> 02:31:07.784
<v Speaker 4>we're looking at some of the muscle </v>
<v Speaker 4>biopsies from various athletes that are </v>

3180
02:31:11.181 --> 02:31:12.230
<v Speaker 4>doing similar things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3181
02:31:12.231 --> 02:31:15.800
<v Speaker 4>he is on a ketogenic diet essentially,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when he does these long races,</v>

3182
02:31:16.010 --> 02:31:18.050
<v Speaker 4>he takes in a considerable amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>glucose.</v>

3183
02:31:18.360 --> 02:31:19.410
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3184
02:31:19.520 --> 02:31:20.290
<v Speaker 4>He</v>

3185
02:31:20.290 --> 02:31:23.130
<v Speaker 3>uses those gels and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>take hundreds and hundreds,</v>

3186
02:31:23.131 --> 02:31:23.964
<v Speaker 3>probably relatively sparingly compared </v>
<v Speaker 3>to a person that's already like very </v>

3187
02:31:27.541 --> 02:31:29.040
<v Speaker 3>carb adapted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

3188
02:31:29.041 --> 02:31:29.874
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you just,</v>

3189
02:31:29.880 --> 02:31:31.860
<v Speaker 3>you just want to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially a hundred mile race,</v>

3190
02:31:31.861 --> 02:31:35.790
<v Speaker 3>you titrate in smaller instead of </v>
<v Speaker 3>drinking 50 or 100 grams of carbs,</v>

3191
02:31:36.120 --> 02:31:36.953
<v Speaker 3>20 grams of carbs every hour or two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe more than enough to say if you </v>

3192
02:31:42.880 --> 02:31:44.960
<v Speaker 3>need to correct us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3193
02:31:44.980 --> 02:31:45.813
<v Speaker 3>Zach has a podcast that he also does </v>
<v Speaker 3>with Sean Baker and he basically eats </v>

3194
02:31:49.651 --> 02:31:50.700
<v Speaker 3>mostly meat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3195
02:31:50.960 --> 02:31:53.220
<v Speaker 3>Zach's diet consists of mostly like rib </v>
<v Speaker 3>eyes,</v>

3196
02:31:53.400 --> 02:31:55.980
<v Speaker 3>so he's fully Quito to Andy's using </v>
<v Speaker 3>glucose.</v>

3197
02:31:55.981 --> 02:31:59.260
<v Speaker 3>I think glucose and this may aggravate </v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the top.</v>

3198
02:31:59.670 --> 02:32:00.503
<v Speaker 3>I think glucose is one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>powerful performance enhancing </v>

3199
02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:06.190
<v Speaker 3>substances out there really on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>record show that,</v>

3200
02:32:06.240 --> 02:32:07.073
<v Speaker 3>especially in the context of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where your glycogen levels are being </v>

3201
02:32:09.991 --> 02:32:11.880
<v Speaker 3>depleted over time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3202
02:32:12.120 --> 02:32:12.953
<v Speaker 3>and even from a training perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very small amounts of glucose are anti </v>

3203
02:32:15.511 --> 02:32:16.344
<v Speaker 3>catabolic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe argue anabolic in the context of </v>

3204
02:32:19.231 --> 02:32:20.000
<v Speaker 3>certain scenarios.</v>

3205
02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:20.833
<v Speaker 3>So Lloyd May,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether drinks coca cola or small </v>

3206
02:32:22.801 --> 02:32:25.440
<v Speaker 3>amounts right after he trains.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3207
02:32:25.590 --> 02:32:27.060
<v Speaker 3>is there any benefit to that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3208
02:32:27.061 --> 02:32:27.894
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get glycogen </v>

3209
02:32:28.231 --> 02:32:29.064
<v Speaker 3>replenishment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's research out of a layman's lab </v>

3210
02:32:33.120 --> 02:32:35.580
<v Speaker 3>years ago that showed that actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>sucrose replenishes glycogen,</v>

3211
02:32:35.590 --> 02:32:36.423
<v Speaker 3>the muscle faster than pure glucose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is interesting probably because </v>

3212
02:32:39.601 --> 02:32:40.434
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fruit dose gets taken up by the </v>

3213
02:32:41.101 --> 02:32:42.660
<v Speaker 3>liver.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the glucose you do eat,</v>

3214
02:32:42.661 --> 02:32:44.760
<v Speaker 3>the liver doesn't steal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>steal any of it,</v>

3215
02:32:44.761 --> 02:32:45.610
<v Speaker 3>and it goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3216
02:32:45.670 --> 02:32:49.440
<v Speaker 3>your glucose go into muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I would say ketones to.</v>

3217
02:32:49.500 --> 02:32:53.460
<v Speaker 3>So if the science is very new but </v>
<v Speaker 3>exogenous ketones,</v>

3218
02:32:53.480 --> 02:32:54.560
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially in the,</v>

3219
02:32:54.940 --> 02:32:59.940
<v Speaker 3>in the context of aerobic performance </v>
<v Speaker 3>key genics or like a ketone Ester,</v>

3220
02:33:00.900 --> 02:33:03.720
<v Speaker 3>a key genics products is great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ketone esters,</v>

3221
02:33:03.721 --> 02:33:05.760
<v Speaker 3>most of the science behind ketone </v>
<v Speaker 3>esters.</v>

3222
02:33:05.790 --> 02:33:07.650
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there are,</v>

3223
02:33:07.740 --> 02:33:08.573
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>valid applications for the ketone salts </v>

3224
02:33:10.081 --> 02:33:12.180
<v Speaker 3>that are emerging on the market too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like eugenics.</v>

3225
02:33:12.420 --> 02:33:13.253
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that the science just over the </v>

3226
02:33:16.950 --> 02:33:18.360
<v Speaker 3>last couple of years has been </v>
<v Speaker 3>incredible,</v>

3227
02:33:18.380 --> 02:33:19.350
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>emerging on that.</v>

3228
02:33:19.351 --> 02:33:21.810
<v Speaker 3>And I think it's something to watch over</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

3229
02:33:21.811 --> 02:33:24.390
<v Speaker 3>It's a new fuel source.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the fourth macronutrient,</v>

3230
02:33:24.540 --> 02:33:25.620
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have carbs,</v>

3231
02:33:25.621 --> 02:33:28.440
<v Speaker 3>proteins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fats and alcohol.</v>

3232
02:33:28.441 --> 02:33:29.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Arguably it can be.</v>

3233
02:33:29.790 --> 02:33:30.623
<v Speaker 3>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I view ketones as they are a calorie </v>

3234
02:33:32.731 --> 02:33:35.180
<v Speaker 3>containing energy source.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they are a fourth macronutrient.</v>

3235
02:33:35.181 --> 02:33:36.001
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me ask you this.</v>

3236
02:33:36.001 --> 02:33:40.080
<v Speaker 3>If you were doing nutritional consultant</v>
<v Speaker 3>for say someone who's a UFC champion and</v>

3237
02:33:40.081 --> 02:33:41.240
<v Speaker 3>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3238
02:33:41.250 --> 02:33:44.010
<v Speaker 3>I want to get on the optimal diet for </v>
<v Speaker 3>performance.</v>

3239
02:33:44.250 --> 02:33:48.150
<v Speaker 3>You don't think that a ketogenic diet is</v>
<v Speaker 3>the optimal diet for performance,</v>

3240
02:33:48.160 --> 02:33:48.993
<v Speaker 3>is that safe to say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or you would have to experience for a </v>

3241
02:33:52.420 --> 02:33:54.750
<v Speaker 3>long period one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's going to be individual.</v>

3242
02:33:54.870 --> 02:33:56.610
<v Speaker 3>You certainly wouldn't do it in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>midst of a camp,</v>

3243
02:33:56.611 --> 02:33:59.230
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If somebody month the,</v>

3244
02:33:59.290 --> 02:34:00.150
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3245
02:34:00.740 --> 02:34:03.210
<v Speaker 3>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's such a new season thing to.</v>

3246
02:34:03.250 --> 02:34:06.990
<v Speaker 3>It's such a nuanced question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the problem is you don't necessarily</v>

3247
02:34:06.991 --> 02:34:09.510
<v Speaker 3>get an off season the in the because if </v>
<v Speaker 3>they call you with a fight,</v>

3248
02:34:09.880 --> 02:34:13.110
<v Speaker 3>not look nicely upon if you turn it </v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

3249
02:34:13.350 --> 02:34:14.970
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3250
02:34:16.530 --> 02:34:18.010
<v Speaker 3>I think on the research I've</v>

3251
02:34:18.010 --> 02:34:18.843
<v Speaker 4>seen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you're hard pressed to convince </v>

3252
02:34:21.131 --> 02:34:26.131
<v Speaker 4>me that a ketogenic diet is worse than a</v>
<v Speaker 4>non ketogenic diet on endurance.</v>

3253
02:34:26.830 --> 02:34:27.663
<v Speaker 4>I think that's pretty clear and there </v>
<v Speaker 4>may actually be some benefits depending </v>

3254
02:34:31.421 --> 02:34:33.580
<v Speaker 4>on the individual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3255
02:34:33.670 --> 02:34:38.670
<v Speaker 4>as far as repeated sprints or things </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you need that anaerobic system,</v>

3256
02:34:39.910 --> 02:34:41.760
<v Speaker 4>I am not ready to say that acute jake </v>
<v Speaker 4>died.</v>

3257
02:34:41.761 --> 02:34:46.480
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be as good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that a non ketogenic diet offers</v>

3258
02:34:46.481 --> 02:34:47.314
<v Speaker 4>you now this is where ketone supplements</v>
<v Speaker 4>may be actually the best thing possible </v>

3259
02:34:51.370 --> 02:34:52.203
<v Speaker 4>because you could be using glucose so </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're getting that fuel source and </v>

3260
02:34:56.321 --> 02:34:59.020
<v Speaker 4>taking a ketone supplement where you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting that fuel as well.</v>

3261
02:34:59.021 --> 02:35:02.620
<v Speaker 4>Not on a ketogenic diet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but taking ketone supplements that will.</v>

3262
02:35:02.860 --> 02:35:05.350
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3263
02:35:05.620 --> 02:35:06.453
<v Speaker 4>I think honestly I want to see more </v>
<v Speaker 4>research so I want to see more reduced </v>

3264
02:35:09.550 --> 02:35:09.890
<v Speaker 4>fat.</v>

3265
02:35:09.890 --> 02:35:12.710
<v Speaker 3>It's carbohydrates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe amino acids,</v>

3266
02:35:12.740 --> 02:35:13.970
<v Speaker 3>Korea 10.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3267
02:35:14.030 --> 02:35:14.863
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just basically trying to leverage all </v>

3268
02:35:17.810 --> 02:35:21.410
<v Speaker 3>the various substrates that your body </v>
<v Speaker 3>can use specially under,</v>

3269
02:35:21.680 --> 02:35:23.760
<v Speaker 3>if we're talking about anaerobic </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ketogenic,</v>

3270
02:35:24.360 --> 02:35:28.790
<v Speaker 3>something you want to have a suite of </v>
<v Speaker 3>different fuel sources,</v>

3271
02:35:28.791 --> 02:35:29.624
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and not rely you like metal bought the </v>

3272
02:35:31.041 --> 02:35:34.190
<v Speaker 3>term metabolic flexibility,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of used use quite often.</v>

3273
02:35:34.340 --> 02:35:35.173
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think if you train and get your </v>

3274
02:35:36.411 --> 02:35:41.090
<v Speaker 3>body fat and Keto adapted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that provides benefits for recovery.</v>

3275
02:35:41.091 --> 02:35:44.060
<v Speaker 3>It provides benefits if you're getting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are the benefits for recovery,</v>

3276
02:35:44.240 --> 02:35:45.710
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>enhanced,</v>

3277
02:35:45.770 --> 02:35:46.520
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3278
02:35:46.520 --> 02:35:49.280
<v Speaker 3>lower inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lower chronic inflammation over time,</v>

3279
02:35:49.310 --> 02:35:50.143
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>chronic inflammation can contribute to </v>

3280
02:35:51.741 --> 02:35:53.900
<v Speaker 3>insulin resistance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>poor Glycan,</v>

3281
02:35:54.310 --> 02:35:59.310
<v Speaker 3>a neuro inflammation if you're getting </v>
<v Speaker 3>concussions or even subconcussive events</v>

3282
02:35:59.661 --> 02:36:02.300
<v Speaker 3>over time can actually cause a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>damage.</v>

3283
02:36:02.301 --> 02:36:03.134
<v Speaker 3>And I think the mechanism that decreases</v>
<v Speaker 3>inflammation with the kidogenic diet as </v>

3284
02:36:06.561 --> 02:36:07.394
<v Speaker 3>opposed to a non a number of mechanisms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean just simply lowering insulin </v>

3285
02:36:11.241 --> 02:36:14.360
<v Speaker 3>spikes in glucose.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the NLRP three inflammasome,</v>

3286
02:36:14.390 --> 02:36:16.910
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is something that we looked at.</v>

3287
02:36:16.911 --> 02:36:17.744
<v Speaker 3>There was a study where actually we used</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ketone ester and it's published in </v>

3288
02:36:20.481 --> 02:36:22.700
<v Speaker 3>the journal Nature Medicine showing </v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

3289
02:36:22.830 --> 02:36:24.980
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in response to Lps,</v>

3290
02:36:24.981 --> 02:36:27.470
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a inflammatory,</v>

3291
02:36:27.500 --> 02:36:28.333
<v Speaker 3>very powerful inflammatory stimulant </v>
<v Speaker 3>that it reduces that and suppresses </v>

3292
02:36:31.370 --> 02:36:36.260
<v Speaker 3>inflammatory pathways for a particular </v>
<v Speaker 3>pathway compared to,</v>

3293
02:36:36.920 --> 02:36:39.740
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>compared to,</v>

3294
02:36:39.980 --> 02:36:40.813
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you mean</v>

3295
02:36:41.510 --> 02:36:44.210
<v Speaker 4>so well with your study,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're always comparing to things.</v>

3296
02:36:44.370 --> 02:36:45.350
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what will you,</v>

3297
02:36:45.440 --> 02:36:47.480
<v Speaker 4>what was the control group?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A,</v>

3298
02:36:48.010 --> 02:36:52.360
<v Speaker 3>the control group for the inflammation </v>
<v Speaker 3>or it was just compared to know,</v>

3299
02:36:52.420 --> 02:36:54.570
<v Speaker 3>like control thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's just like,</v>

3300
02:36:54.710 --> 02:36:55.840
<v Speaker 3>did you give us any CBO?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3301
02:36:55.900 --> 02:36:56.733
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

3302
02:36:56.770 --> 02:37:00.670
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so in the context of being in a state of</v>

3303
02:37:00.671 --> 02:37:04.300
<v Speaker 3>Ketosis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it reduces an inflammatory pathway.</v>

3304
02:37:04.301 --> 02:37:06.460
<v Speaker 3>Think of it as a hub and when that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>activated,</v>

3305
02:37:06.910 --> 02:37:07.743
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a host of inflammatory </v>

3306
02:37:08.951 --> 02:37:13.951
<v Speaker 3>cytokines that flow throughout your body</v>
<v Speaker 3>and your brain and causes persistent low</v>

3307
02:37:13.991 --> 02:37:18.680
<v Speaker 3>grade a neuro inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>inflammation in the body that can impede</v>

3308
02:37:19.220 --> 02:37:20.053
<v Speaker 3>recovery processes over time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think that really contributes to </v>

3309
02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:26.330
<v Speaker 3>brain health too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I might be getting a little far ahead</v>

3310
02:37:26.331 --> 02:37:28.850
<v Speaker 3>of myself because that is its animal </v>
<v Speaker 3>work,</v>

3311
02:37:29.060 --> 02:37:29.893
<v Speaker 3>but it's convincing animal work,</v>
<v Speaker 3>looking at a particular pathway that's </v>

3312
02:37:32.661 --> 02:37:36.740
<v Speaker 3>pretty well defined before you get to </v>
<v Speaker 3>this is their one zero variation between</v>

3313
02:37:36.770 --> 02:37:41.770
<v Speaker 3>a low carb versus ketosis in elevation </v>
<v Speaker 3>of ketone levels in your blood.</v>

3314
02:37:42.950 --> 02:37:44.690
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I mean in terms of a,</v>

3315
02:37:45.170 --> 02:37:46.003
<v Speaker 3>is there a benefit to the ketogenic to </v>
<v Speaker 3>being in a state of Ketosis with this </v>

3316
02:37:50.451 --> 02:37:53.520
<v Speaker 3>reduction of inflammation versus low </v>
<v Speaker 3>carb a?</v>

3317
02:37:53.640 --> 02:37:58.040
<v Speaker 3>I believe there is just by elevating the</v>
<v Speaker 3>metabolite,</v>

3318
02:37:58.100 --> 02:37:58.933
<v Speaker 3>a Beta hydroxy butyrate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I do think even low carb has some </v>

3319
02:38:03.440 --> 02:38:06.500
<v Speaker 3>antiinflammatory effects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but optimal would be ketosis.</v>

3320
02:38:06.760 --> 02:38:07.860
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3321
02:38:08.300 --> 02:38:09.133
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's going to be optimal </v>

3322
02:38:10.821 --> 02:38:11.654
<v Speaker 3>for everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know there's going to be benefits </v>

3323
02:38:13.670 --> 02:38:18.670
<v Speaker 3>to maintaining low to moderate levels of</v>
<v Speaker 3>ketones for neurological health and also</v>

3324
02:38:19.220 --> 02:38:23.130
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for recovery and maybe performance lane.</v>

3325
02:38:23.150 --> 02:38:26.060
<v Speaker 3>You were wincing at the mention of </v>
<v Speaker 3>inflammation</v>

3326
02:38:26.680 --> 02:38:27.513
<v Speaker 2>more so that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we mentioned recovery from exercise </v>

3327
02:38:29.501 --> 02:38:30.610
<v Speaker 2>and inflammation and calories</v>

3328
02:38:30.640 --> 02:38:34.360
<v Speaker 3>deficit is a very powerful anti and anti</v>
<v Speaker 3>inflammatory.</v>

3329
02:38:34.390 --> 02:38:36.120
<v Speaker 3>So I mean Lane Lane address.</v>

3330
02:38:36.380 --> 02:38:37.213
<v Speaker 2>Thank you for the context.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My fellow scientists known Zilla </v>

3331
02:38:38.720 --> 02:38:42.050
<v Speaker 2>appreciate that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one thing I want to,</v>

3332
02:38:42.210 --> 02:38:43.043
<v Speaker 2>because because people get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's easy to get into black and white </v>

3333
02:38:44.541 --> 02:38:46.340
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We hear inflammation and we think,</v>

3334
02:38:46.341 --> 02:38:46.591
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3335
02:38:46.591 --> 02:38:47.540
<v Speaker 2>that's bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's bad.</v>

3336
02:38:48.530 --> 02:38:51.650
<v Speaker 2>So there's some studies that tell us </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite a bit about inflammation.</v>

3337
02:38:51.680 --> 02:38:54.740
<v Speaker 2>Your body actually has an optimal level </v>
<v Speaker 2>of inflammation,</v>

3338
02:38:55.070 --> 02:38:55.903
<v Speaker 2>too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Little inflammation is actually bad as </v>

3339
02:38:57.261 --> 02:38:59.990
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you first chronic.</v>

3340
02:38:59.991 --> 02:39:01.130
<v Speaker 2>I was talking about chronic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3341
02:39:01.150 --> 02:39:02.570
<v Speaker 2>This is a lot of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of scientists,</v>

3342
02:39:02.571 --> 02:39:03.404
<v Speaker 2>ms dot two is an acute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can tell about tor and cancer and </v>

3343
02:39:05.901 --> 02:39:06.734
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>acute versus chronic and how scientists </v>

3344
02:39:07.941 --> 02:39:11.090
<v Speaker 2>even messed this stuff up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you.</v>

3345
02:39:11.220 --> 02:39:12.053
<v Speaker 2>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at studies of recovery from </v>

3346
02:39:13.401 --> 02:39:16.670
<v Speaker 2>exercise and muscle growth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm focusing on this,</v>

3347
02:39:16.730 --> 02:39:17.900
<v Speaker 2>but I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll bring it back around.</v>

3348
02:39:19.310 --> 02:39:24.310
<v Speaker 2>If you give Ibuprofen to healthy people </v>
<v Speaker 2>who have normal levels of inflammation,</v>

3349
02:39:25.240 --> 02:39:27.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ibuprofen inhibits muscle growth.</v>

3350
02:39:28.490 --> 02:39:32.030
<v Speaker 2>If you give it to elderly people with </v>
<v Speaker 2>high levels of inflammation,</v>

3351
02:39:32.270 --> 02:39:37.270
<v Speaker 2>they grow more muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this means that the body for recovery</v>

3352
02:39:37.880 --> 02:39:40.790
<v Speaker 2>has an optimal level of inflammation at </v>
<v Speaker 2>likes to be in.</v>

3353
02:39:40.791 --> 02:39:43.910
<v Speaker 2>There is a a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a kind of a curve here.</v>

3354
02:39:44.270 --> 02:39:47.770
<v Speaker 2>It's a cox two inhibitor and Beta </v>
<v Speaker 2>hydroxybutyrate is also a costume,</v>

3355
02:39:47.850 --> 02:39:48.683
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so the part of growing muscle and </v>

3356
02:39:51.681 --> 02:39:52.514
<v Speaker 2>recovery is actually inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Macrophages and all these sorts of </v>

3357
02:39:56.361 --> 02:39:59.630
<v Speaker 2>things are involved in that process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now if it gets run away,</v>

3358
02:39:59.631 --> 02:40:02.030
<v Speaker 2>if it's too much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a good thing,</v>

3359
02:40:02.031 --> 02:40:03.950
<v Speaker 2>but if it's too little,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also not a good thing.</v>

3360
02:40:04.160 --> 02:40:04.993
<v Speaker 2>Andy Galpin did a great job on your show</v>
<v Speaker 2>of talking about a recovery versus </v>

3361
02:40:09.081 --> 02:40:10.520
<v Speaker 2>adaptation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3362
02:40:10.610 --> 02:40:11.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things he said,</v>

3363
02:40:11.961 --> 02:40:13.040
<v Speaker 2>if you do ice baths,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

3364
02:40:13.140 --> 02:40:16.140
<v Speaker 2>these sorts of things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your in the short term,</v>

3365
02:40:16.141 --> 02:40:16.974
<v Speaker 2>allowing yourself to recover faster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're also limiting how much </v>

3366
02:40:19.621 --> 02:40:21.270
<v Speaker 2>adaptation you're going to incur.</v>

3367
02:40:21.680 --> 02:40:24.600
<v Speaker 2>And I loved that because it was people </v>
<v Speaker 2>miss this.</v>

3368
02:40:24.630 --> 02:40:26.000
<v Speaker 2>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3369
02:40:26.010 --> 02:40:27.990
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're somebody in the off season,</v>

3370
02:40:28.020 --> 02:40:31.200
<v Speaker 2>if you're trying to grow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get more lean body mass or trying to get</v>

3371
02:40:31.201 --> 02:40:34.920
<v Speaker 2>better at something,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's probably good to let your body like</v>

3372
02:40:35.850 --> 02:40:36.683
<v Speaker 2>for lack of better term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have some inflammation and not in the </v>

3373
02:40:39.031 --> 02:40:41.610
<v Speaker 2>longterm but in response to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>training session.</v>

3374
02:40:42.120 --> 02:40:43.950
<v Speaker 2>But then if you're in a camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

3375
02:40:43.951 --> 02:40:44.784
<v Speaker 2>this is where it's context dependent or </v>
<v Speaker 2>like I'm a power lifter getting ready </v>

3376
02:40:47.520 --> 02:40:50.010
<v Speaker 2>for a meet and I'm supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>squatting four times a week.</v>

3377
02:40:50.040 --> 02:40:50.873
<v Speaker 2>I've done that before and I'm so sore </v>
<v Speaker 2>that I can't squat my fourth session </v>

3378
02:40:54.860 --> 02:40:55.693
<v Speaker 2>than an ice bath or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not worried about growing muscle in </v>

3379
02:40:57.481 --> 02:40:58.314
<v Speaker 2>that time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm worried about getting recovered </v>

3380
02:41:00.361 --> 02:41:01.194
<v Speaker 2>enough that I can go do my next training</v>
<v Speaker 2>session because that is a lot more </v>

3381
02:41:03.301 --> 02:41:05.010
<v Speaker 2>important for my competition coming up.</v>

3382
02:41:05.460 --> 02:41:07.260
<v Speaker 2>Then having that little bit of extra </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscle.</v>

3383
02:41:07.290 --> 02:41:09.350
<v Speaker 2>So in camp,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably a good idea.</v>

3384
02:41:09.390 --> 02:41:11.820
<v Speaker 2>Postseason not a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3385
02:41:11.821 --> 02:41:14.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean unless again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all contextual dependent,</v>

3386
02:41:14.131 --> 02:41:14.964
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you start getting so sore that </v>

3387
02:41:16.471 --> 02:41:20.040
<v Speaker 2>you can only train like twice a week,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then maybe a certain level,</v>

3388
02:41:20.370 --> 02:41:21.203
<v Speaker 2>but that points back to that there's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>optimal range of inflammation that your </v>

3389
02:41:25.441 --> 02:41:28.470
<v Speaker 2>body probably should be in that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>optimal for health as well.</v>

3390
02:41:28.710 --> 02:41:31.270
<v Speaker 2>Now I don't think like doing a ketogenic</v>
<v Speaker 2>diet for somebody,</v>

3391
02:41:31.300 --> 02:41:33.180
<v Speaker 2>it's going to take them out of that </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily,</v>

3392
02:41:33.450 --> 02:41:34.283
<v Speaker 2>but I always want to give context </v>
<v Speaker 2>because people hear these things and </v>

3393
02:41:37.111 --> 02:41:39.990
<v Speaker 2>they always think it's a positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in terms of recovery,</v>

3394
02:41:40.170 --> 02:41:41.003
<v Speaker 3>I believe that it can enhance the </v>
<v Speaker 3>adaptive process associated with </v>

3395
02:41:44.071 --> 02:41:44.904
<v Speaker 3>recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I also believe that being in a </v>

3396
02:41:46.561 --> 02:41:49.980
<v Speaker 3>ketogenic state will enhance your </v>
<v Speaker 3>readiness,</v>

3397
02:41:50.490 --> 02:41:55.490
<v Speaker 3>your resilience and your recovery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So from a military perspective too,</v>

3398
02:41:55.600 --> 02:41:57.380
<v Speaker 3>I believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3399
02:41:57.450 --> 02:41:58.283
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that needs to be validated and </v>

3400
02:41:59.940 --> 02:42:00.940
<v Speaker 3>study,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's something that,</v>

3401
02:42:01.030 --> 02:42:02.210
<v Speaker 3>that we study.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you,</v>

3402
02:42:02.220 --> 02:42:05.100
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry to interrupt you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when you advise us to the military,</v>

3403
02:42:05.340 --> 02:42:06.173
<v Speaker 3>do they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you put them on a specific meal plan </v>

3404
02:42:07.921 --> 02:42:08.910
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or do they have,</v>

3405
02:42:08.911 --> 02:42:10.020
<v Speaker 3>it's more like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3406
02:42:10.021 --> 02:42:13.770
<v Speaker 3>how to do that grants whereas is being </v>
<v Speaker 3>studied at a very fundamental,</v>

3407
02:42:13.771 --> 02:42:14.604
<v Speaker 3>very controlled level from cells to </v>
<v Speaker 3>animal models to human clinical trials </v>

3408
02:42:19.620 --> 02:42:20.453
<v Speaker 3>going on and where the data is being </v>
<v Speaker 3>collected now and some of it is taken </v>

3409
02:42:23.731 --> 02:42:27.210
<v Speaker 3>empirically and anecdotally from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>field or just from various,</v>

3410
02:42:27.250 --> 02:42:28.830
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>exclusive channels.</v>

3411
02:42:28.831 --> 02:42:30.390
<v Speaker 3>I guess I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3412
02:42:30.480 --> 02:42:32.980
<v Speaker 3>so that I am coming at it as a biased </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm,</v>

3413
02:42:32.981 --> 02:42:34.950
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of speaking ahead of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>science,</v>

3414
02:42:35.640 --> 02:42:36.473
<v Speaker 3>but I do think that science already </v>
<v Speaker 3>exist showing that you have a greater </v>

3415
02:42:42.121 --> 02:42:42.954
<v Speaker 3>adaptive effect just by virtue of </v>
<v Speaker 3>lowering inflammation over time in </v>

3416
02:42:46.771 --> 02:42:47.880
<v Speaker 3>athletes especially.</v>

3417
02:42:48.090 --> 02:42:50.880
<v Speaker 3>This probably pertains more to endurance</v>
<v Speaker 3>athletes,</v>

3418
02:42:51.060 --> 02:42:53.790
<v Speaker 3>so it really needs to be studied in </v>
<v Speaker 3>resistance trend,</v>

3419
02:42:53.791 --> 02:42:55.170
<v Speaker 3>mma fighters and things like that.</v>

3420
02:42:55.820 --> 02:42:58.820
<v Speaker 2>So there was a recent study that I can't</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember the researchers,</v>

3421
02:42:58.821 --> 02:42:59.900
<v Speaker 2>Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll send it to you.</v>

3422
02:43:00.170 --> 02:43:01.003
<v Speaker 2>I had a lot of criticisms of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they did show that ketogenic versus </v>

3423
02:43:04.581 --> 02:43:09.020
<v Speaker 2>non ketogenic diet and people who were </v>
<v Speaker 2>lifting weights trying to get bigger,</v>

3424
02:43:09.530 --> 02:43:10.363
<v Speaker 2>that there was actually slightly less </v>
<v Speaker 2>mass using the ketogenic diet where you </v>

3425
02:43:13.901 --> 02:43:15.640
<v Speaker 2>think that would be because of the less </v>
<v Speaker 2>protein?</v>

3426
02:43:16.330 --> 02:43:17.530
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they equated protein.</v>

3427
02:43:17.590 --> 02:43:19.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure I want to say they </v>
<v Speaker 2>equate it.</v>

3428
02:43:19.601 --> 02:43:21.940
<v Speaker 2>Protein now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know for sure.</v>

3429
02:43:22.120 --> 02:43:24.220
<v Speaker 2>So I don't want to say authoritative </v>
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>

3430
02:43:24.270 --> 02:43:26.330
<v Speaker 2>but I believe to stay in Ketosis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to.</v>

3431
02:43:26.410 --> 02:43:30.610
<v Speaker 2>How did they adjust for calories?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe they did.</v>

3432
02:43:30.760 --> 02:43:33.550
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could be wrong and so I'll go back and</v>

3433
02:43:33.551 --> 02:43:35.710
<v Speaker 2>look and I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll send it to you if you want it.</v>

3434
02:43:35.990 --> 02:43:38.410
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is possible like again,</v>

3435
02:43:38.470 --> 02:43:40.630
<v Speaker 2>for every given me there's a Gotcha in </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain things.</v>

3436
02:43:40.630 --> 02:43:41.463
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like these things that activate </v>

3437
02:43:43.571 --> 02:43:44.740
<v Speaker 2>different pathways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3438
02:43:45.220 --> 02:43:46.053
<v Speaker 2>part of what ketones may signal as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>deficit because usually you don't have </v>

3439
02:43:48.791 --> 02:43:50.260
<v Speaker 2>them in a surplus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3440
02:43:50.710 --> 02:43:52.240
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3441
02:43:52.630 --> 02:43:55.360
<v Speaker 2>we don't know if you can like for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

3442
02:43:55.361 --> 02:43:56.920
<v Speaker 2>like a tough dog,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3443
02:43:56.921 --> 02:43:59.080
<v Speaker 2>Like if we're talking about performance </v>
<v Speaker 2>and muscle,</v>

3444
02:43:59.680 --> 02:44:01.370
<v Speaker 2>everybody here is a tough gig and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very,</v>

3445
02:44:01.450 --> 02:44:02.283
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's such a weird way to pronounce </v>

3446
02:44:02.951 --> 02:44:07.630
<v Speaker 2>that because it's auto and phagocytosis </v>
<v Speaker 2>so it shouldn't be out of age.</v>

3447
02:44:07.660 --> 02:44:10.960
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a very rapidly emerging science.</v>

3448
02:44:10.961 --> 02:44:14.590
<v Speaker 2>And Naomi Whittell wrote a book about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this and it just,</v>

3449
02:44:14.591 --> 02:44:17.380
<v Speaker 2>it's like a New York Times bestseller </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that really covers a science.</v>

3450
02:44:17.381 --> 02:44:19.540
<v Speaker 2>So licensed since two or three years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3451
02:44:19.541 --> 02:44:22.480
<v Speaker 2>License almost remodeling and </v>
<v Speaker 2>degradation of proteins,</v>

3452
02:44:22.481 --> 02:44:23.790
<v Speaker 2>but very high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>

3453
02:44:23.820 --> 02:44:26.590
<v Speaker 2>what gets me is like people who are big </v>
<v Speaker 2>on intermittent fasting,</v>

3454
02:44:27.090 --> 02:44:27.850
<v Speaker 2>they'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3455
02:44:27.850 --> 02:44:29.880
<v Speaker 2>increases a tough Gig,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you also,</v>

3456
02:44:29.990 --> 02:44:30.823
<v Speaker 2>they're also saying you can grow all </v>
<v Speaker 2>this muscle and it's going to be best </v>

3457
02:44:32.891 --> 02:44:33.724
<v Speaker 2>for building muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not true because autophagy </v>

3458
02:44:36.070 --> 02:44:38.050
<v Speaker 2>autophagy is part of protein </v>
<v Speaker 2>degradation.</v>

3459
02:44:38.350 --> 02:44:43.350
<v Speaker 2>So if you're increasing that system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by definition that's less muscle.</v>

3460
02:44:43.420 --> 02:44:45.460
<v Speaker 2>So you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always a give me an a Gotcha.</v>

3461
02:44:45.461 --> 02:44:47.230
<v Speaker 2>For one benefit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there might be a drawback.</v>

3462
02:44:47.231 --> 02:44:49.360
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on your individual situation,</v>

3463
02:44:49.690 --> 02:44:51.220
<v Speaker 2>maybe it makes more sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3464
02:44:51.430 --> 02:44:52.263
<v Speaker 2>Like having the most muscle mass </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible may not be the best thing for </v>

3465
02:44:56.081 --> 02:44:58.540
<v Speaker 2>health.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we know that having,</v>

3466
02:44:58.630 --> 02:45:00.760
<v Speaker 2>having more muscle mass than normal is </v>
<v Speaker 2>good for health,</v>

3467
02:45:01.120 --> 02:45:01.953
<v Speaker 2>but maybe having like absolute peak </v>
<v Speaker 2>muscle mass may not be the best thing </v>

3468
02:45:04.361 --> 02:45:05.194
<v Speaker 2>for help,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

3469
02:45:05.200 --> 02:45:06.033
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why I was trying to say earlier </v>

3470
02:45:08.560 --> 02:45:12.220
<v Speaker 2>there's never going to be one diet that </v>
<v Speaker 2>just fixes all of our problems.</v>

3471
02:45:12.370 --> 02:45:15.640
<v Speaker 2>It depends on the individual and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're trying to get out of it.</v>

3472
02:45:16.000 --> 02:45:17.080
<v Speaker 2>Just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3473
02:45:17.380 --> 02:45:20.740
<v Speaker 2>if I went to a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and again I'm not a have much.</v>

3474
02:45:20.950 --> 02:45:23.350
<v Speaker 2>I watched MMA for years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Loved your commentary.</v>

3475
02:45:23.350 --> 02:45:25.480
<v Speaker 2>That's where I learned a lot of stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>about eminent mma,</v>

3476
02:45:25.780 --> 02:45:28.240
<v Speaker 2>but if I went to a Brazilian Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 2>instructor and I said,</v>

3477
02:45:28.450 --> 02:45:29.283
<v Speaker 2>what's the best technique?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got to look at me like I'm an </v>

3478
02:45:31.451 --> 02:45:32.740
<v Speaker 2>idiot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3479
02:45:32.950 --> 02:45:35.270
<v Speaker 2>Because he's not going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3480
02:45:35.290 --> 02:45:36.123
<v Speaker 2>a arm bar every time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the best technique for Jujitsu </v>

3481
02:45:38.890 --> 02:45:40.270
<v Speaker 2>and that's when people say what's the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best diet?</v>

3482
02:45:40.271 --> 02:45:41.690
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3483
02:45:41.710 --> 02:45:43.780
<v Speaker 2>It's completely contextual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dependent,</v>

3484
02:45:44.110 --> 02:45:44.943
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Depends on you and in the case of </v>

3485
02:45:46.451 --> 02:45:48.010
<v Speaker 2>inmate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>depends on your opponent as well.</v>

3486
02:45:48.100 --> 02:45:51.250
<v Speaker 2>What your goals are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your strategies and your tactics.</v>

3487
02:45:51.280 --> 02:45:52.113
<v Speaker 2>I think what we were trying to really </v>
<v Speaker 2>emphasize is that individuality </v>

3488
02:45:55.480 --> 02:45:58.030
<v Speaker 2>dependent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also I really want to emphasize that</v>

3489
02:45:58.031 --> 02:46:00.010
<v Speaker 2>this show was calories matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3490
02:46:00.130 --> 02:46:03.340
<v Speaker 2>calories matter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even in even if you're eating low carb,</v>

3491
02:46:03.850 --> 02:46:08.850
<v Speaker 2>you can't just eat as much as you want </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Herbie is a very viable option</v>

3492
02:46:10.940 --> 02:46:15.940
<v Speaker 4>to induce and sustain a calorie deficit </v>
<v Speaker 4>that can contribute to body composition.</v>

3493
02:46:17.060 --> 02:46:18.910
<v Speaker 4>But even like you brought up a floyd </v>
<v Speaker 4>mayweather,</v>

3494
02:46:18.940 --> 02:46:19.773
<v Speaker 4>whether earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which I thought was great because you </v>

3495
02:46:20.781 --> 02:46:23.720
<v Speaker 4>said he drinks a coke after trading.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3496
02:46:23.750 --> 02:46:26.000
<v Speaker 4>it's hard to argue with his results.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But then again,</v>

3497
02:46:26.240 --> 02:46:27.073
<v Speaker 4>sometimes elite athletes can get away </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a lot of really dumb shit because </v>

3498
02:46:31.041 --> 02:46:31.874
<v Speaker 4>they're so genetically superior that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they were going to do well no matter </v>

3499
02:46:34.281 --> 02:46:35.114
<v Speaker 4>what.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did Michael Jordan eat a big Mac before </v>

3500
02:46:36.351 --> 02:46:37.670
<v Speaker 4>every game?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3501
02:46:37.730 --> 02:46:40.760
<v Speaker 4>not true steak and baked potato,</v>
<v Speaker 4>steak and baked potato.</v>

3502
02:46:41.090 --> 02:46:41.923
<v Speaker 4>Whereas the big MACs Myth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>myth come from fucking by Mcdonald's </v>

3503
02:46:44.610 --> 02:46:49.610
<v Speaker 4>model steak and baked potatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sounds like my wife can eat two or three</v>

3504
02:46:50.031 --> 02:46:50.864
<v Speaker 4>big MACs and a sitting and wash it down </v>
<v Speaker 4>with a full sugar coke and still gain </v>

3505
02:46:54.051 --> 02:46:56.240
<v Speaker 4>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I cringe,</v>

3506
02:46:56.241 --> 02:46:58.250
<v Speaker 4>but she.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people can do that.</v>

3507
02:46:58.430 --> 02:46:59.690
<v Speaker 4>Some people can do this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

3508
02:47:00.510 --> 02:47:01.450
<v Speaker 4>But this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's.</v>

3509
02:47:01.490 --> 02:47:02.323
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did he become this great because he ate </v>

3510
02:47:04.401 --> 02:47:07.760
<v Speaker 4>this way or can he eat this way because </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's this great athlete.</v>

3511
02:47:07.830 --> 02:47:09.770
<v Speaker 4>I probably the latter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3512
02:47:10.220 --> 02:47:11.053
<v Speaker 4>So we wouldn't recommend like somebody </v>
<v Speaker 4>like if somebody is sitting at home and </v>

3513
02:47:14.001 --> 02:47:15.680
<v Speaker 4>they want to become the greatest boxer </v>
<v Speaker 4>ever,</v>

3514
02:47:15.890 --> 02:47:16.723
<v Speaker 4>don't go pro ball.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Public drinking coke isn't the first </v>

3515
02:47:18.921 --> 02:47:19.790
<v Speaker 4>step.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3516
02:47:20.150 --> 02:47:20.983
<v Speaker 4>But this is what we do with nutrition </v>
<v Speaker 4>because we pick out people that we </v>

3517
02:47:23.391 --> 02:47:24.750
<v Speaker 4>follow and we go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh I,</v>

3518
02:47:24.830 --> 02:47:28.400
<v Speaker 4>I'm just gonna do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's so individualized.</v>

3519
02:47:28.410 --> 02:47:32.120
<v Speaker 4>The sidelines and marathons,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they'll hand off coax to people.</v>

3520
02:47:33.350 --> 02:47:34.183
<v Speaker 4>I've seen it because people just want it</v>
<v Speaker 4>for fuel and people just wanting it for </v>

3521
02:47:37.401 --> 02:47:38.234
<v Speaker 4>fuel tasted it is not a bad idea when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're doing something that's as </v>

3522
02:47:40.911 --> 02:47:43.010
<v Speaker 4>grueling as American.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to say it's a bad idea.</v>

3523
02:47:43.011 --> 02:47:43.370
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>

3524
02:47:43.370 --> 02:47:45.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not against it either.</v>

3525
02:47:45.021 --> 02:47:46.760
<v Speaker 4>If you're a carpenter now it makes </v>
<v Speaker 4>sense.</v>

3526
02:47:47.270 --> 02:47:48.260
<v Speaker 4>Dense,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3527
02:47:48.680 --> 02:47:49.513
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you want calorie dense stuff when </v>

3528
02:47:50.460 --> 02:47:52.820
<v Speaker 4>you're absolutely a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

3529
02:47:52.880 --> 02:47:56.990
<v Speaker 4>context is so important because we don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>ever drink a coke.</v>

3530
02:47:56.991 --> 02:47:58.820
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you were starving to death,</v>

3531
02:47:58.821 --> 02:48:00.620
<v Speaker 4>I promise you you drink a coke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3532
02:48:00.621 --> 02:48:02.080
<v Speaker 4>so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>

3533
02:48:02.230 --> 02:48:03.063
<v Speaker 4>And if you need quick energy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's probably not the worst thing that </v>

3534
02:48:05.481 --> 02:48:08.570
<v Speaker 4>floyd mayweather could possibly do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Posts but not optimal.</v>

3535
02:48:08.820 --> 02:48:10.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people eat those honey waffles,</v>

3536
02:48:10.971 --> 02:48:13.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when they're doing hikes and stuff.</v>

3537
02:48:13.280 --> 02:48:14.720
<v Speaker 4>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the end of the day,</v>

3538
02:48:14.900 --> 02:48:15.740
<v Speaker 4>if,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if he,</v>

3539
02:48:15.741 --> 02:48:18.050
<v Speaker 4>if his car was hydrated and take it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what it is,</v>

3540
02:48:18.051 --> 02:48:18.884
<v Speaker 4>but if he's eating five,</v>
<v Speaker 4>600 grams of carbohydrate a day isn't </v>

3541
02:48:21.710 --> 02:48:22.543
<v Speaker 4>really hurting him to have 40 grams of </v>
<v Speaker 4>sugar from a coke if he's like </v>

3542
02:48:25.510 --> 02:48:27.350
<v Speaker 4>maintaining his bodyweight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>performing optimally.</v>

3543
02:48:28.460 --> 02:48:31.190
<v Speaker 4>When you think about the kind of </v>
<v Speaker 4>grueling workouts that guy puts his,</v>

3544
02:48:31.690 --> 02:48:34.430
<v Speaker 4>maybe that's the only way he can maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

3545
02:48:34.431 --> 02:48:35.280
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

3546
02:48:35.480 --> 02:48:36.313
<v Speaker 4>I am theorizing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's the only way he can get </v>

3547
02:48:38.931 --> 02:48:39.764
<v Speaker 4>enough food in is to eat really energy </v>
<v Speaker 4>dense sources of food to maintain his </v>

3548
02:48:43.740 --> 02:48:45.350
<v Speaker 4>bodyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And if you started saying,</v>

3549
02:48:45.351 --> 02:48:48.470
<v Speaker 4>well we need you to eat chicken breast </v>
<v Speaker 4>and Broccoli and you know,</v>

3550
02:48:48.471 --> 02:48:50.960
<v Speaker 4>this organic rice and all this kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He,</v>

3551
02:48:51.050 --> 02:48:51.883
<v Speaker 4>he might start dropping weight like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>stone and his performance go in the </v>

3552
02:48:53.931 --> 02:48:57.590
<v Speaker 4>tank.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is why context is so important.</v>

3553
02:48:57.650 --> 02:49:01.190
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when we talk about people think,</v>

3554
02:49:01.880 --> 02:49:02.713
<v Speaker 4>how many times have you seen two guys in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the octagon and just looked at their </v>

3555
02:49:05.451 --> 02:49:06.284
<v Speaker 4>bodies and gun,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this one going to smash this other guy </v>

3556
02:49:08.281 --> 02:49:09.114
<v Speaker 4>like just in the primal part of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>brain because he was built like a tank </v>

3557
02:49:13.140 --> 02:49:13.973
<v Speaker 4>and then the other guy who looks like </v>
<v Speaker 4>nothing just goes out and completely </v>

3558
02:49:15.361 --> 02:49:15.800
<v Speaker 4>obliterate.</v>

3559
02:49:15.800 --> 02:49:16.700
<v Speaker 4>It,</v>
<v Speaker 4>happens all the time,</v>

3560
02:49:16.701 --> 02:49:17.940
<v Speaker 4>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all the time.</v>

3561
02:49:18.120 --> 02:49:22.110
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's completely context dependent.</v>

3562
02:49:22.120 --> 02:49:22.953
<v Speaker 4>The biggest thing is to make sure that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't run out of fuel during these </v>

3563
02:49:25.651 --> 02:49:26.670
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3564
02:49:27.030 --> 02:49:29.970
<v Speaker 4>Or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And whatever your sport is.</v>

3565
02:49:29.971 --> 02:49:30.780
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

3566
02:49:30.780 --> 02:49:34.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm known as a carb guy and I had this </v>
<v Speaker 4>powerlifter one time telling me,</v>

3567
02:49:34.860 --> 02:49:36.750
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't you think you should carb load the</v>

3568
02:49:36.751 --> 02:49:38.100
<v Speaker 4>night before?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

3569
02:49:38.640 --> 02:49:39.473
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're doing nine reps like you're </v>

3570
02:49:40.770 --> 02:49:42.270
<v Speaker 4>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you get three attempts on each lift,</v>

3571
02:49:42.300 --> 02:49:43.440
<v Speaker 4>squat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bench press and deadlift.</v>

3572
02:49:44.100 --> 02:49:46.470
<v Speaker 4>You're not depleting glycogen Harb </v>
<v Speaker 4>Limited.</v>

3573
02:49:47.390 --> 02:49:48.480
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

3574
02:49:48.510 --> 02:49:51.840
<v Speaker 4>Really amazed me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even like you can fast for a week,</v>

3575
02:49:51.870 --> 02:49:53.010
<v Speaker 4>which I did,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and deadly.</v>

3576
02:49:53.040 --> 02:49:58.040
<v Speaker 4>And it's not a significant a inhibitor </v>
<v Speaker 4>of your.</v>

3577
02:49:59.160 --> 02:49:59.993
<v Speaker 4>Of your performance running would be </v>
<v Speaker 4>hills or something like that or doing </v>

3578
02:50:04.880 --> 02:50:06.750
<v Speaker 4>rowing prolonged,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3579
02:50:06.790 --> 02:50:08.060
<v Speaker 4>resistance training,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two or three,</v>

3580
02:50:08.120 --> 02:50:10.800
<v Speaker 4>three hours,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it's probably not optimal to go and</v>

3581
02:50:10.930 --> 02:50:13.350
<v Speaker 4>fasted to a strength,</v>
<v Speaker 4>an athletic event,</v>

3582
02:50:13.380 --> 02:50:14.640
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

3583
02:50:14.641 --> 02:50:17.160
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to pick the context,</v>

3584
02:50:17.161 --> 02:50:17.994
<v Speaker 4>the individual and honestly people </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably aren't gonna want to hear this </v>

3585
02:50:20.581 --> 02:50:21.414
<v Speaker 4>from a scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we don't know enough about this </v>

3586
02:50:22.591 --> 02:50:26.610
<v Speaker 4>stuff yet to really say for each </v>
<v Speaker 4>individual person what's best for them.</v>

3587
02:50:26.610 --> 02:50:28.950
<v Speaker 4>And that's why we kinda got to go by </v>
<v Speaker 4>feel.</v>

3588
02:50:28.951 --> 02:50:29.784
<v Speaker 4>We know you don't have to go drinking </v>
<v Speaker 4>gatorade throughout your one hour </v>

3589
02:50:31.981 --> 02:50:33.840
<v Speaker 4>workout in the gym.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Typically,</v>

3590
02:50:33.870 --> 02:50:34.703
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

3591
02:50:34.760 --> 02:50:36.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm drinking ketones,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

3592
02:50:36.330 --> 02:50:37.163
<v Speaker 4>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not going to offer you any </v>

3593
02:50:38.311 --> 02:50:40.960
<v Speaker 4>advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>

3594
02:50:41.010 --> 02:50:44.730
<v Speaker 4>And I did that for many years actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think guys still do it now.</v>

3595
02:50:44.790 --> 02:50:45.623
<v Speaker 4>Of course when we see it all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got to make your shake in the gym and </v>

3596
02:50:48.391 --> 02:50:49.820
<v Speaker 4>drink a interim work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One thing that,</v>

3597
02:50:49.830 --> 02:50:50.663
<v Speaker 4>one of the things that drove me nuts was</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kinda gotten a little back and forth </v>

3598
02:50:53.671 --> 02:50:58.380
<v Speaker 4>with Tim noakes on twitter and he kind </v>
<v Speaker 4>of made it out to seem that,</v>

3599
02:50:58.920 --> 02:50:59.753
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people were just missing some of his </v>

3600
02:51:01.441 --> 02:51:05.250
<v Speaker 4>research because people in academia or </v>
<v Speaker 4>that peer review is broken.</v>

3601
02:51:05.280 --> 02:51:06.810
<v Speaker 4>Who's a tim noakes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3602
02:51:06.811 --> 02:51:08.490
<v Speaker 4>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a big proponent.</v>

3603
02:51:08.490 --> 02:51:10.380
<v Speaker 4>He's a professor in South Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to say,</v>

3604
02:51:10.960 --> 02:51:14.730
<v Speaker 4>and very knowledgeable and opinionated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but very knowledgeable.</v>

3605
02:51:14.731 --> 02:51:15.930
<v Speaker 4>He said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

3606
02:51:15.931 --> 02:51:16.764
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's because you've never challenged </v>

3607
02:51:17.401 --> 02:51:20.670
<v Speaker 4>convention because I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was and and dog knows.</v>

3608
02:51:20.671 --> 02:51:21.504
<v Speaker 4>I have challenged every convention in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fitness industry that there ever </v>

3609
02:51:24.151 --> 02:51:25.860
<v Speaker 4>was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's just,</v>

3610
02:51:26.220 --> 02:51:26.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when,</v>

3611
02:51:26.760 --> 02:51:29.320
<v Speaker 4>when people asked me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's vocal about it.</v>

3612
02:51:29.520 --> 02:51:30.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Assertive,</v>

3613
02:51:30.361 --> 02:51:31.770
<v Speaker 4>but also open minded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3614
02:51:31.771 --> 02:51:36.640
<v Speaker 4>I'm very open minded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just don't like if you can't show me a</v>

3615
02:51:36.710 --> 02:51:38.580
<v Speaker 4>hard evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3616
02:51:38.850 --> 02:51:42.930
<v Speaker 4>like there was a great quote from Thomas</v>
<v Speaker 4>Soul that I saw the other day.</v>

3617
02:51:43.290 --> 02:51:44.123
<v Speaker 4>It said you could ask these in science </v>
<v Speaker 4>and go a long way in terms of sorting </v>

3618
02:51:47.551 --> 02:51:51.690
<v Speaker 4>out bullshit compared to what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3619
02:51:51.810 --> 02:51:54.230
<v Speaker 4>where's your heart evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3620
02:51:54.330 --> 02:51:56.250
<v Speaker 4>and what is the cost,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3621
02:51:56.670 --> 02:51:57.930
<v Speaker 4>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

3622
02:51:57.931 --> 02:52:02.931
<v Speaker 4>low carb is better compared to what and </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the cost on performance or any of</v>

3623
02:52:03.991 --> 02:52:06.140
<v Speaker 4>these other things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then where's</v>

3624
02:52:06.160 --> 02:52:07.630
<v Speaker 2>your heart evidence?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3625
02:52:07.631 --> 02:52:09.610
<v Speaker 2>So this is why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

3626
02:52:09.611 --> 02:52:12.760
<v Speaker 2>science over time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

3627
02:52:12.761 --> 02:52:13.594
<v Speaker 2>you can have industry influences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can have muddled data and some </v>

3628
02:52:16.841 --> 02:52:18.460
<v Speaker 2>scientists fake data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've,</v>

3629
02:52:18.580 --> 02:52:22.270
<v Speaker 2>we've both come across this scientist </v>
<v Speaker 2>who have fake data are frustrating.</v>

3630
02:52:22.271 --> 02:52:22.990
<v Speaker 2>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3631
02:52:22.990 --> 02:52:25.240
<v Speaker 2>it makes me so incensed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

3632
02:52:25.241 --> 02:52:27.010
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't say anybody by name,</v>

3633
02:52:27.280 --> 02:52:28.113
<v Speaker 2>but I used to be in business with </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody who I found out that I had no </v>

3634
02:52:31.841 --> 02:52:32.674
<v Speaker 2>hard evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I had a lot of circumstantial </v>

3635
02:52:34.901 --> 02:52:39.310
<v Speaker 2>evidence that they were faking data and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's even happens in cancer research.</v>

3636
02:52:39.340 --> 02:52:44.200
<v Speaker 2>It's a huge role even in cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I took this person out to dinner and</v>

3637
02:52:44.201 --> 02:52:45.490
<v Speaker 2>I told them was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3638
02:52:45.491 --> 02:52:47.440
<v Speaker 2>we're done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this thing we're doing is done.</v>

3639
02:52:47.840 --> 02:52:50.710
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and thank goodness I did because it came</v>

3640
02:52:50.711 --> 02:52:51.544
<v Speaker 2>out later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people started replicating trying to </v>

3641
02:52:52.541 --> 02:52:53.374
<v Speaker 2>replicate this data and nobody can </v>
<v Speaker 2>replicate this data and and they still </v>

3642
02:52:57.461 --> 02:53:00.930
<v Speaker 2>had a pretty big following even now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

3643
02:53:00.940 --> 02:53:02.140
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those things,</v>

3644
02:53:02.160 --> 02:53:02.993
<v Speaker 2>it makes me so mad because then people </v>
<v Speaker 2>would get so frustrated because they </v>

3645
02:53:06.131 --> 02:53:08.950
<v Speaker 2>feel like if they feel like scientists </v>
<v Speaker 2>or just an industry's pocket,</v>

3646
02:53:09.430 --> 02:53:10.660
<v Speaker 2>why are they going to believe anything?</v>

3647
02:53:10.660 --> 02:53:12.070
<v Speaker 2>Any of us say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3648
02:53:12.071 --> 02:53:14.410
<v Speaker 2>it's so frustrating and that's why </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivation,</v>

3649
02:53:15.190 --> 02:53:16.300
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>power,</v>

3650
02:53:16.900 --> 02:53:18.130
<v Speaker 2>ego.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If a labs,</v>

3651
02:53:18.160 --> 02:53:18.993
<v Speaker 2>it's a company's funding you for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular supplement and you come out </v>

3652
02:53:22.151 --> 02:53:22.984
<v Speaker 2>with consistently with negative data,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the incentive for them to keep </v>

3653
02:53:26.351 --> 02:53:27.250
<v Speaker 2>funding you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you,</v>

3654
02:53:27.251 --> 02:53:30.220
<v Speaker 2>if you're always showing positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>results on supplement studies,</v>

3655
02:53:30.610 --> 02:53:32.250
<v Speaker 2>settlements will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Companies will want to fund you.</v>

3656
02:53:32.260 --> 02:53:33.340
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now of course,</v>

3657
02:53:33.520 --> 02:53:35.350
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so seamlessly,</v>

3658
02:53:35.470 --> 02:53:36.303
<v Speaker 2>so danger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I also want people to keep in mind </v>

3659
02:53:37.520 --> 02:53:40.240
<v Speaker 2>that it's gotta be done in a very </v>
<v Speaker 2>controlled,</v>

3660
02:53:40.241 --> 02:53:42.250
<v Speaker 2>blinded fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the only way around it.</v>

3661
02:53:42.310 --> 02:53:45.040
<v Speaker 2>I keep reminding people like people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>say things like,</v>

3662
02:53:45.100 --> 02:53:48.280
<v Speaker 2>we found the cure for cancer and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government is suppressing it,</v>

3663
02:53:48.281 --> 02:53:50.860
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

3664
02:53:50.861 --> 02:53:51.694
<v Speaker 2>all the scientists are just in the pie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You what you're saying is you're saying </v>

3665
02:53:54.101 --> 02:53:58.690
<v Speaker 2>that every scientist on the planet who </v>
<v Speaker 2>does cancer research is an immoral,</v>

3666
02:53:59.140 --> 02:54:00.250
<v Speaker 2>unethical piece of shit.</v>

3667
02:54:01.060 --> 02:54:01.893
<v Speaker 2>That's what you're saying because you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>just telling me they don't have friends </v>

3668
02:54:04.781 --> 02:54:08.650
<v Speaker 2>and family who are dealing with cancer </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're suppressing this research.</v>

3669
02:54:08.651 --> 02:54:10.030
<v Speaker 2>Come on now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3670
02:54:10.031 --> 02:54:11.560
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the other big.</v>

3671
02:54:11.930 --> 02:54:12.763
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a small government guy and I'm like </v>

3672
02:54:14.651 --> 02:54:15.484
<v Speaker 2>I said Libertarian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the things that makes me </v>

3673
02:54:16.811 --> 02:54:17.644
<v Speaker 2>cringe about libertarian sometimes as </v>
<v Speaker 2>these big elaborate conspiracy theories </v>

3674
02:54:20.651 --> 02:54:21.484
<v Speaker 2>that come up around science and whatnot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you realize like a senator can't </v>

3675
02:54:24.041 --> 02:54:24.874
<v Speaker 2>even a text,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a dick pic to is his side chick without </v>

3676
02:54:27.641 --> 02:54:29.410
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it winded up all over twitter.</v>

3677
02:54:29.411 --> 02:54:31.690
<v Speaker 2>You think they constructed these big </v>
<v Speaker 2>elaborate theories.</v>

3678
02:54:31.691 --> 02:54:35.080
<v Speaker 2>They can't even tie their shoes in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>morning without spending $10,000.</v>

3679
02:54:35.081 --> 02:54:35.914
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the idea that like all this research </v>

3680
02:54:37.961 --> 02:54:41.920
<v Speaker 2>is being suppressed by the government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying it's never happened,</v>

3681
02:54:41.921 --> 02:54:45.760
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's pretty darn rare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well Gentlemen,</v>

3682
02:54:45.761 --> 02:54:48.790
<v Speaker 2>we just did three plus hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

3683
02:54:49.490 --> 02:54:54.490
<v Speaker 2>Felt like six.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just appreciate you giving us.</v>

3684
02:54:56.960 --> 02:54:59.470
<v Speaker 2>Thanks for illuminating this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is still.</v>

3685
02:54:59.650 --> 02:55:00.483
<v Speaker 2>It's so complex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's part of the problem and I think </v>

3686
02:55:02.471 --> 02:55:03.304
<v Speaker 2>we give you 100 of these shows and we'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>never cover all the topics are all the </v>

3687
02:55:06.710 --> 02:55:07.543
<v Speaker 2>issues are all the details and I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so incredibly difficult for people </v>

3688
02:55:10.701 --> 02:55:13.580
<v Speaker 2>to find the right diet and program that </v>
<v Speaker 2>works for them.</v>

3689
02:55:13.690 --> 02:55:14.523
<v Speaker 3>I'd like to add one thing that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>science is rapidly emerging and the </v>

3690
02:55:16.961 --> 02:55:17.794
<v Speaker 3>metabolic health summit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is happening in a the end of </v>

3691
02:55:21.610 --> 02:55:24.760
<v Speaker 3>January,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beginning of February next year 2019,</v>

3692
02:55:25.120 --> 02:55:25.953
<v Speaker 3>we'll be bringing in the leading </v>
<v Speaker 3>scientists that are talking about all </v>

3693
02:55:29.561 --> 02:55:30.394
<v Speaker 3>the different topics right now including</v>
<v Speaker 3>your weight loss and that's going to be </v>

3694
02:55:33.011 --> 02:55:33.844
<v Speaker 3>in la.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's actually there's a flyer in your </v>

3695
02:55:35.531 --> 02:55:36.364
<v Speaker 3>book there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look inside there giving you a </v>

3696
02:55:38.591 --> 02:55:39.424
<v Speaker 3>flyer.</v>

3697
02:55:39.510 --> 02:55:40.600
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>La,</v>

3698
02:55:40.601 --> 02:55:45.250
<v Speaker 2>a January 31st to February third in Long</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beach Metabolic</v>

3699
02:55:45.250 --> 02:55:46.083
<v Speaker 3>health summit.com.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be very comprehensive </v>

3700
02:55:51.190 --> 02:55:53.890
<v Speaker 3>group of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of basic scientists,</v>

3701
02:55:53.891 --> 02:55:58.420
<v Speaker 3>clinical scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>entrepreneurs and people everyday people</v>

3702
02:55:58.480 --> 02:56:01.870
<v Speaker 3>that are just interested in this space.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You going and I will be added.</v>

3703
02:56:01.871 --> 02:56:04.460
<v Speaker 3>I'm helping to sort of organize and </v>
<v Speaker 3>promote it,</v>

3704
02:56:04.480 --> 02:56:05.313
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also moderating some of the things </v>

3705
02:56:06.611 --> 02:56:09.280
<v Speaker 3>we're going to hit on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basically every topic that was discussed</v>

3706
02:56:09.281 --> 02:56:12.550
<v Speaker 3>in my last podcast in this podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the leading scientists I'm going to show</v>

3707
02:56:12.551 --> 02:56:13.590
<v Speaker 3>up and heckle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3708
02:56:13.640 --> 02:56:14.473
<v Speaker 3>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we definitely went lay in there too and </v>

3709
02:56:15.851 --> 02:56:16.684
<v Speaker 3>I think it would be great to have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>panel discussion that addresses this </v>

3710
02:56:19.511 --> 02:56:22.580
<v Speaker 3>with a couple more experts and </v>
<v Speaker 3>personalities and in that</v>

3711
02:56:23.180 --> 02:56:26.230
<v Speaker 2>it's amazing how much information you </v>
<v Speaker 2>have to absorb.</v>

3712
02:56:26.550 --> 02:56:27.383
<v Speaker 2>It's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done so many diet podcasts and am </v>

3713
02:56:30.221 --> 02:56:32.520
<v Speaker 2>still a moron.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why you'll,</v>

3714
02:56:32.650 --> 02:56:34.180
<v Speaker 2>I always tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3715
02:56:34.690 --> 02:56:35.523
<v Speaker 2>it's hard because if you're not going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do a degree yourself or do research </v>

3716
02:56:37.901 --> 02:56:40.000
<v Speaker 2>yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so hard to know who,</v>

3717
02:56:40.060 --> 02:56:42.250
<v Speaker 2>like you kind of have to pick people </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you trust.</v>

3718
02:56:42.550 --> 02:56:43.383
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's so hard to know who to trust </v>

3719
02:56:45.041 --> 02:56:46.960
<v Speaker 2>because there was something that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3720
02:56:47.050 --> 02:56:47.883
<v Speaker 2>Greg knuckles really smart guy said that</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think kind of ties things together </v>

3721
02:56:51.371 --> 02:56:52.204
<v Speaker 2>nicely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

3722
02:56:52.570 --> 02:56:53.403
<v Speaker 2>people are really good at knowing when </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody has more knowledge than them </v>

3723
02:56:55.901 --> 02:56:58.060
<v Speaker 2>about a subject.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you talked to somebody for a little</v>

3724
02:56:58.061 --> 02:56:58.894
<v Speaker 2>bit and you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really can get an impression pretty </v>

3725
02:56:59.981 --> 02:57:02.170
<v Speaker 2>quickly if they know more or less than </v>
<v Speaker 2>you are about the same.</v>

3726
02:57:02.650 --> 02:57:06.730
<v Speaker 2>What they're really bad at doing is </v>
<v Speaker 2>figuring out amongst two people who know</v>

3727
02:57:06.731 --> 02:57:07.564
<v Speaker 2>more than them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is the more knowledgeable of the </v>

3728
02:57:08.831 --> 02:57:09.580
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>

3729
02:57:09.580 --> 02:57:10.413
<v Speaker 2>They are very bad at picking that out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you kinda got to pick people who you </v>

3730
02:57:14.141 --> 02:57:14.974
<v Speaker 2>trust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

3731
02:57:15.100 --> 02:57:19.420
<v Speaker 2>if you're looking for people to trust,</v>
<v Speaker 2>notice the three magic words that me and</v>

3732
02:57:19.421 --> 02:57:21.580
<v Speaker 2>him both sit on here today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At one point,</v>

3733
02:57:21.940 --> 02:57:26.410
<v Speaker 2>I don't know it well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Usually experts,</v>

3734
02:57:26.680 --> 02:57:29.680
<v Speaker 2>they don't make broad claims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't use superlatives.</v>

3735
02:57:29.710 --> 02:57:32.080
<v Speaker 2>They don't say things like best,</v>
<v Speaker 2>worst,</v>

3736
02:57:32.230 --> 02:57:33.063
<v Speaker 2>never always.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're usually putting context to </v>

3737
02:57:35.861 --> 02:57:36.694
<v Speaker 2>everything and they're providing you </v>
<v Speaker 2>with information that helps illuminate </v>

3738
02:57:40.691 --> 02:57:42.190
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That everything is nuanced.</v>

3739
02:57:42.970 --> 02:57:44.290
<v Speaker 2>And that's why like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure,</v>

3740
02:57:44.291 --> 02:57:45.580
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll relate it to mma.</v>

3741
02:57:45.910 --> 02:57:46.743
<v Speaker 2>If you talk to anybody who's an expert </v>
<v Speaker 2>in any different discipline and you </v>

3742
02:57:50.231 --> 02:57:51.064
<v Speaker 2>asked them abroad question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get a really broad </v>

3743
02:57:52.721 --> 02:57:55.150
<v Speaker 2>answer and if you ask them a specific </v>
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>

3744
02:57:55.151 --> 02:57:57.310
<v Speaker 2>give him a lot of contexts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they'll give you a specific answer.</v>

3745
02:57:57.730 --> 02:57:59.260
<v Speaker 2>But I would you agree with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

3746
02:57:59.350 --> 02:58:02.100
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think someone's strong on one</v>

3747
02:58:02.100 --> 02:58:02.933
<v Speaker 3>side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dig kind of deep and look for conflicts </v>

3748
02:58:04.801 --> 02:58:05.634
<v Speaker 3>of interest to and kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that's kind of an important </v>

3749
02:58:08.131 --> 02:58:08.964
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I try to be transparent as much as </v>

3750
02:58:10.261 --> 02:58:12.810
<v Speaker 3>possible on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on sort of things we're involved in.</v>

3751
02:58:12.840 --> 02:58:16.170
<v Speaker 3>So I think that super important without </v>
<v Speaker 3>bias too.</v>

3752
02:58:16.171 --> 02:58:18.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean I sell stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've got a book out,</v>

3753
02:58:18.450 --> 02:58:20.820
<v Speaker 3>I've got another book coming out of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>website,</v>

3754
02:58:21.110 --> 02:58:21.943
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's.</v>

3755
02:58:21.990 --> 02:58:23.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're not actually.</v>

3756
02:58:23.160 --> 02:58:26.160
<v Speaker 3>Well not advocating any particular </v>
