00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.030
<v Speaker 1>Lots of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of challenges growing up and then </v>

2
00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.500
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden when I was actually away</v>
<v Speaker 1>from all of the stuff that else familiar</v>

3
00:00:07.501 --> 00:00:12.501
<v Speaker 1>with people that were familiar with me </v>
<v Speaker 1>with nice to be able to be in a setting </v>

4
00:00:12.501 --> 00:00:15.441
<v Speaker 1>where uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was actually excelling and achieving </v>

5
00:00:15.441 --> 00:00:16.720
<v Speaker 1>things anonymously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

6
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.770
<v Speaker 1>there was things that were happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>that all of a sudden I was shining in a </v>

7
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.500
<v Speaker 1>way but not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

8
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.700
<v Speaker 1>none of my people back in the where I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was from knew anything about it.</v>

9
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.320
<v Speaker 1>But I was doing really well.</v>

10
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.350
<v Speaker 2>Discipline and resolve and doing any </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult endeavor is so important for a</v>

11
00:00:33.351 --> 00:00:34.430
<v Speaker 2>young man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

12
00:00:34.431 --> 00:00:39.431
<v Speaker 2>and this is one of the sort of themes </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've brought up on this podcast many </v>

13
00:00:39.431 --> 00:00:42.731
<v Speaker 2>times is it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there's no coming of age rituals in </v>

14
00:00:42.731 --> 00:00:46.631
<v Speaker 2>our culture anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I always thought they were retarded </v>

15
00:00:46.631 --> 00:00:46.631
<v Speaker 2>when I was young.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

16
00:00:46.631 --> 00:00:50.561
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are these fucking idiots hanging </v>

17
00:00:50.561 --> 00:00:50.561
<v Speaker 2>themselves by their tits and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or you know,</v>

18
00:00:50.561 --> 00:00:53.740
<v Speaker 2>putting their hands in the bullet ant </v>
<v Speaker 2>bins.</v>

19
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.750
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is wrong with these </v>

20
00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.750
<v Speaker 2>people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would they like,</v>

21
00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm 18.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a man.</v>

22
00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.750
<v Speaker 2>Done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

23
00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:59.240
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>

24
00:00:59.241 --> 00:01:01.550
<v Speaker 2>You really need to go through something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need to,</v>

25
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.870
<v Speaker 2>you need to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

26
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.990
<v Speaker 2>you need to have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why so many cultures have either </v>

27
00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.381
<v Speaker 2>a psychedelic experiences that young </v>
<v Speaker 2>people go through or what we talked </v>

28
00:01:11.381 --> 00:01:12.740
<v Speaker 2>about this yesterday or deal poisons </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's,</v>

29
00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.080
<v Speaker 2>it's not a psychedelic because it's not </v>
<v Speaker 2>in their area,</v>

30
00:01:15.081 --> 00:01:17.810
<v Speaker 2>so they take something that almost kills</v>
<v Speaker 2>them and then when it's over,</v>

31
00:01:17.811 --> 00:01:20.110
<v Speaker 2>they're just so happy to be healthy </v>
<v Speaker 2>again and alive.</v>

32
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.550
<v Speaker 2>And they sort of realized they've gone </v>
<v Speaker 2>through a tunnel.</v>

33
00:01:22.551 --> 00:01:24.050
<v Speaker 2>They made it through a passage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've,</v>

34
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.370
<v Speaker 2>they've reached an actual new level and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're missing that man.</v>

35
00:01:28.371 --> 00:01:31.310
<v Speaker 2>We get out of fucking high school and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then we're just lost.</v>

36
00:01:31.311 --> 00:01:34.430
<v Speaker 2>Were panicking completely terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to starve to death.</v>

37
00:01:34.431 --> 00:01:39.431
<v Speaker 2>Is clinging onto the first job or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first opportunity for some sort of </v>

38
00:01:39.431 --> 00:01:40.040
<v Speaker 2>security that we can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

39
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.080
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only good thing that I could ever </v>

40
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.711
<v Speaker 2>think about having sort of some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>a mandatory military experience for most</v>

41
00:01:50.391 --> 00:01:53.720
<v Speaker 2>United States citizens is to two fold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One,</v>

42
00:01:53.721 --> 00:01:58.721
<v Speaker 2>so people could understand what the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>the military is really all about and of </v>

43
00:01:58.721 --> 00:01:58.721
<v Speaker 2>this nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>raw,</v>

44
00:01:58.721 --> 00:02:03.320
<v Speaker 2>raw chicken Hawk bullshit where people </v>
<v Speaker 2>support this idea of sending our fucking</v>

45
00:02:03.321 --> 00:02:08.321
<v Speaker 2>trained killers to these places where we</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know anybody and fucking them up </v>

46
00:02:08.321 --> 00:02:08.990
<v Speaker 2>in the name of justice or whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it is.</v>

47
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.180
<v Speaker 2>We would get a better idea of what that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

48
00:02:11.181 --> 00:02:16.181
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be harder to pull the wool over </v>

49
00:02:16.181 --> 00:02:17.531
<v Speaker 2>people's eyes because it's so easy for </v>
<v Speaker 2>all these people that will have nothing </v>

50
00:02:17.531 --> 00:02:20.831
<v Speaker 2>to do with shooting anybody ever to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>we support the troops and support you </v>

51
00:02:20.831 --> 00:02:25.461
<v Speaker 2>are heroes and you're the reason why we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can be free and nonsensical statements </v>

52
00:02:25.851 --> 00:02:30.851
<v Speaker 2>that mean the reason why that shit flies</v>
<v Speaker 2>is because we got a nice blanket.</v>

53
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.830
<v Speaker 2>This blanket of security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the USA,</v>

54
00:02:33.831 --> 00:02:35.870
<v Speaker 2>whatever the fuck it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>throw it over your head.</v>

55
00:02:35.871 --> 00:02:37.610
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't really have to think about the</v>

56
00:02:37.611 --> 00:02:41.030
<v Speaker 2>actual horrors of military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we forced people to join,</v>

57
00:02:41.031 --> 00:02:46.031
<v Speaker 2>and I'm not saying we should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that the only benefit that we would </v>

58
00:02:46.031 --> 00:02:49.391
<v Speaker 2>get out of that as it people would kind </v>
<v Speaker 2>of get an idea of what reality really </v>

59
00:02:49.391 --> 00:02:49.391
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

60
00:02:49.391 --> 00:02:51.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a fine line you.</v>

61
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.200
<v Speaker 1>There's no way to really kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to really be able to direct that </v>

62
00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.941
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really as an individual and an </v>

63
00:03:00.941 --> 00:03:03.100
<v Speaker 1>individual thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be people that figure </v>

64
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.460
<v Speaker 1>out a way to make that work for them in </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of being lazy.</v>

65
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.850
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got out of shape in the army when I </v>

66
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.251
<v Speaker 1>got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I went in because back when I sold </v>

67
00:03:11.251 --> 00:03:11.740
<v Speaker 1>the system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they,</v>

68
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.450
<v Speaker 1>when I went in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they uh,</v>

69
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.720
<v Speaker 1>they wanted people in so they weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really pushing people to heart and </v>

70
00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.850
<v Speaker 1>within a period of time when we didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a lot of obvious conflict going on,</v>

71
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:26.851
<v Speaker 1>so it seemed like everything was sorted </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself out and why am I going to the </v>

72
00:03:26.851 --> 00:03:30.871
<v Speaker 1>military other than just getting a </v>
<v Speaker 1>college fund out of it and then it's </v>

73
00:03:30.871 --> 00:03:30.871
<v Speaker 1>fucking off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

74
00:03:30.871 --> 00:03:30.880
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

75
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.420
<v Speaker 1>so they were kind of like kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>lowered the standard a little bit to </v>

76
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.570
<v Speaker 1>kind of get more people in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a mistake,</v>

77
00:03:37.571 --> 00:03:39.670
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still learned a lot of.</v>

78
00:03:39.671 --> 00:03:42.100
<v Speaker 1>What year was this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is from 80 to 85.</v>

79
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.170
<v Speaker 2>I came real close to joining an 85 when </v>
<v Speaker 2>they got into high school,</v>

80
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.090

<v Speaker 2>they had an army taekwondo team.</v>

81
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.720

<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 2>easy just job,</v>

83
00:03:50.671 --> 00:03:53.610
<v Speaker 2>but they would pay you to train and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>give you a or they told you,</v>

84
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.430

97
00:04:29.371 --> 00:04:32.610

104
00:04:53.971 --> 00:04:54.310
<v Speaker 2>see them sitting down like reading the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bible before they'd fight and I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>every time he would fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he would,</v>

111
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.150
<v Speaker 2>he would sit down and read the Bible </v>
<v Speaker 2>before we would go out there and he was </v>

<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

116
00:05:22.601 --> 00:05:24.250
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's the move,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe the army.</v>

117
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.910
<v Speaker 2>And I looked back on it now and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

118
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.550
<v Speaker 2>that weird feeling of indecision than I </v>
<v Speaker 2>had when I got out of high school.</v>

119
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.830
<v Speaker 2>It makes me so sympathetic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

120
00:05:32.831 --> 00:05:37.831
<v Speaker 2>And that's why whenever anybody tries to</v>
<v Speaker 2>criticize the actual people that are </v>

121
00:05:38.261 --> 00:05:39.580
<v Speaker 2>over there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the actual troops,</v>

122
00:05:39.581 --> 00:05:40.030
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

123
00:05:40.031 --> 00:05:41.130
<v Speaker 2>that is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

124
00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:42.910
<v Speaker 2>Well they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the one that is actually pulling</v>

125
00:05:42.911 --> 00:05:44.060
<v Speaker 2>the trigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the one like,</v>

126
00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.080
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't even know what kind of </v>

127
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.080
<v Speaker 2>momentum is behind being a part of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>machine like that.</v>

128
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.240
<v Speaker 2>And being a 20 year old man or an 18 </v>
<v Speaker 2>year old man and you know,</v>

129
00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.800
<v Speaker 2>and wanting to respect and admiration of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your peers and you're fucking,</v>

130
00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.410
<v Speaker 2>your ceo is telling you whatever the guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

131
00:06:00.411 --> 00:06:05.411
<v Speaker 2>the head guy is telling you that they'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>give you an extra leave if you kill a </v>

132
00:06:05.411 --> 00:06:05.720
<v Speaker 2>guy with a knife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And have you ever seen those guys?</v>

133
00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.720
<v Speaker 2>The describing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a video,</v>

134
00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.310
<v Speaker 2>I don't want anybody to look at it right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

135
00:06:10.311 --> 00:06:14.960
<v Speaker 2>but there's a video called American </v>
<v Speaker 2>soldier throws away his metals.</v>

136
00:06:14.961 --> 00:06:16.230
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

137
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:22.270
<v Speaker 2>Iraq veterans against the war videos </v>
<v Speaker 2>where this guy talks extremely candidly </v>

138
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.970
<v Speaker 2>about his time in Iraq and killing </v>
<v Speaker 2>civilians.</v>

139
00:06:25.971 --> 00:06:28.850
<v Speaker 2>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's intense shit because,</v>

140
00:06:28.851 --> 00:06:30.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's not proud of this.</v>

141
00:06:30.501 --> 00:06:34.670
<v Speaker 2>And he's swallowing his words and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking incredibly honestly,</v>

142
00:06:34.671 --> 00:06:38.120
<v Speaker 2>but it's fucking his chief officer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoever the fuck it was,</v>

143
00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:40.040
<v Speaker 2>the head guy told them they'd given four</v>
<v Speaker 2>days leave.</v>

144
00:06:40.041 --> 00:06:43.700
<v Speaker 2>They killed a guy with a knife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they had an extra incentive to kill a</v>

145
00:06:43.701 --> 00:06:44.540
<v Speaker 2>guy with a knife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

146
00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:46.550
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>

147
00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.410
<v Speaker 2>fuck yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck yeah,</v>

148
00:06:48.411 --> 00:06:49.390
<v Speaker 2>freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

149
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:51.810
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

150
00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:53.580
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

151
00:06:53.581 --> 00:06:55.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody in some way I think,</v>

152
00:06:55.321 --> 00:06:58.530
<v Speaker 1>I think you're right about trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out a way that have some,</v>

153
00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.730
<v Speaker 1>some more perspective on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

154
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:07.130
<v Speaker 1>just putting the situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting people in this situation where </v>

155
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:09.891
<v Speaker 1>they have to kind of go through that for</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and kind of discover your </v>

156
00:07:09.891 --> 00:07:13.320
<v Speaker 1>inner warrior in Michigan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That kind of becoming a person.</v>

157
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:17.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm a male or female,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just trying to figure out what that next</v>

158
00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:22.940
<v Speaker 1>step for you is separating from the nest</v>
<v Speaker 1>and becoming your own person and you </v>

159
00:07:23.281 --> 00:07:25.360
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to uh,</v>

160
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:27.510
<v Speaker 1>we can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can talk around it all you want,</v>

161
00:07:27.511 --> 00:07:30.780
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>monsters in the world.</v>

162
00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.270
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them are us in,</v>

163
00:07:33.271 --> 00:07:33.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

164
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:34.740
<v Speaker 1>that's what comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

165
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.260
<v Speaker 1>we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have the capacity for amazing,</v>

166
00:07:37.261 --> 00:07:38.040
<v Speaker 1>wonderful things.</v>

167
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.650
<v Speaker 1>We have the capacity for some </v>
<v Speaker 1>horrendous,</v>

168
00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:45.710
<v Speaker 1>awful things as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think part of that having that </v>

169
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:50.570
<v Speaker 1>warrior awakened in you is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is more about understanding the monster </v>

170
00:07:52.831 --> 00:07:57.831
<v Speaker 1>in you and understanding how to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>that at bay and understand how to keep </v>

171
00:07:57.831 --> 00:07:58.530
<v Speaker 1>that in check so that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

172
00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:02.460
<v Speaker 1>making it a global,</v>
<v Speaker 1>global perspective.</v>

173
00:08:02.461 --> 00:08:05.480
<v Speaker 1>And I am in no way am I a hippie or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

174
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm delusional about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not just going to have world peace</v>

175
00:08:09.361 --> 00:08:10.850
<v Speaker 1>someday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

176
00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.030
<v Speaker 1>it's just not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

177
00:08:12.031 --> 00:08:17.031
<v Speaker 1>you hit the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be struggling with our </v>

178
00:08:17.031 --> 00:08:17.031
<v Speaker 1>inner monster forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some,</v>

179
00:08:17.031 --> 00:08:21.020
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are monsters that are just out </v>

180
00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:23.400
<v Speaker 1>more in areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reality is we have to keep that </v>

181
00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:23.610
<v Speaker 1>in check.</v>

182
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:29.080
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we lack any sort of a logical use guide </v>

183
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:30.900
<v Speaker 2>for being a human.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

184
00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:35.980
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're essentially go on the experiences </v>

185
00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:37.040
<v Speaker 2>of people before us and occasionally we </v>
<v Speaker 2>get wisdom.</v>

186
00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:41.450
<v Speaker 2>Like that poem that you read or that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>excerpt that you read,</v>

187
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:45.410
<v Speaker 2>which is genius and brilliant from a man</v>
<v Speaker 2>who lived 200 years ago.</v>

188
00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:46.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

189
00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:51.230
<v Speaker 2>more than likely you get a fucking Moron</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a dad who pump bullshit in your head</v>

190
00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:53.480
<v Speaker 2>until you're 18.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you leave and you're like,</v>

191
00:08:53.481 --> 00:08:58.440
<v Speaker 2>these fucking niggers are trying to take</v>
<v Speaker 2>jobs and like fucking kid.</v>

192
00:08:58.441 --> 00:09:00.390
<v Speaker 2>He's in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a shovel.</v>

193
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:01.620
<v Speaker 2>The job for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

194
00:09:01.621 --> 00:09:03.570
<v Speaker 2>you're quitting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

195
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:04.520
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

196
00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:09.970
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a weird thing I've tried to hire </v>

197
00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:12.501
<v Speaker 2>your nephew is they keep morons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are allowed to raise more and you're </v>

198
00:09:12.961 --> 00:09:16.860
<v Speaker 2>allowed to homeschool them to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Allow it to sit them down and teach them</v>

199
00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:22.220
<v Speaker 2>the same idiotic nonsense that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>learned and keep the same pattern of </v>

200
00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:23.460
<v Speaker 2>fear and ignorance going.</v>

201
00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:25.560
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very strange.</v>

202
00:09:25.590 --> 00:09:27.750
<v Speaker 2>It's very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's no way to cure that either.</v>

203
00:09:27.751 --> 00:09:32.751
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is any man to tell any other man in </v>

204
00:09:32.751 --> 00:09:35.590
<v Speaker 2>until we have some really incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>sophisticated ways of measuring </v>

205
00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:37.180
<v Speaker 2>convenance that are just rock solid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

206
00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:37.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

207
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:41.370
<v Speaker 2>like a litmus liquor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd used to do a joke in my act about if</v>

208
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:46.630
<v Speaker 2>you could find out if you were an idiot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as easy as he could find out if you're </v>

209
00:09:46.630 --> 00:09:49.491
<v Speaker 2>pregnant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just go and lick something and look </v>

210
00:09:49.491 --> 00:09:49.491
<v Speaker 2>at and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a fucking idiot.</v>

211
00:09:49.491 --> 00:09:50.190
<v Speaker 2>There's no way this is broken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You throw it away.</v>

212
00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.790
<v Speaker 2>There'd be a pile of idiot detectors up </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the fucking moon and you'd be like,</v>

213
00:09:53.850 --> 00:09:58.850
<v Speaker 2>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking throw it down and grab another </v>

214
00:09:58.850 --> 00:09:59.550
<v Speaker 2>one until that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you say a man can't have a baby?</v>

215
00:09:59.551 --> 00:10:00.960
<v Speaker 2>How do you make,</v>
<v Speaker 2>say a guy,</v>

216
00:10:00.961 --> 00:10:01.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

217
00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:03.480
<v Speaker 2>can't raise a family and teach it.</v>

218
00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:05.430
<v Speaker 2>It's on his own values.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can't.</v>

219
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:08.280
<v Speaker 2>I think there's not going to want to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>all 1984.</v>

220
00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:11.280
<v Speaker 2>But I think in terms of like say for </v>
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

221
00:10:11.281 --> 00:10:13.380
<v Speaker 2>health benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the,</v>

222
00:10:13.381 --> 00:10:14.870
<v Speaker 2>if you go in to get some kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

223
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:16.480
<v Speaker 2>something for your cold or your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

224
00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.280
<v Speaker 2>you're just basically sick now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

225
00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:21.150
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your arm chopped off.</v>

226
00:10:21.151 --> 00:10:21.720
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

227
00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:24.720
<v Speaker 2>we understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But as far as just general health,</v>

228
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:30.350
<v Speaker 2>if uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if for some reason you go in for that </v>

229
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:30.440
<v Speaker 2>kind of general health stuff and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

230
00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:35.540
<v Speaker 2>I think they should be able to run your </v>
<v Speaker 2>credit card statement to see if you'd </v>

231
00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:35.540
<v Speaker 2>been to Mcdonald's lately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've been at Mcdonald's,</v>

232
00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:39.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drinking coca cola or eating the candies</v>

233
00:10:39.361 --> 00:10:40.610
<v Speaker 2>are hitting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hitting the,</v>

234
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:41.940
<v Speaker 2>hitting the fast food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

235
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:42.560
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

236
00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:45.900
<v Speaker 2>you don't get anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had this idea for a long times that</v>

237
00:10:45.901 --> 00:10:49.680
<v Speaker 2>the way to strengthen America is really </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make less losers.</v>

238
00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.500
<v Speaker 2>So anytime there's any sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation like that,</v>

239
00:10:53.190 --> 00:10:57.720
<v Speaker 2>there should be some resources dedicated</v>
<v Speaker 2>to pulling people out of that in a,</v>

240
00:10:57.721 --> 00:10:59.730
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a really enthusiastic way.</v>

241
00:10:59.731 --> 00:11:04.110
<v Speaker 2>The same way this research is dedicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>to rebuilding Iraq after we blow it up.</v>

242
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:09.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean there should be a way to like let</v>
<v Speaker 2>people know the infrastructure of </v>

243
00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:12.030
<v Speaker 2>America needs to be rebuilt to that </v>
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure of humanity.</v>

244
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.940
<v Speaker 2>The infrastructure in the age of </v>
<v Speaker 2>information with all the,</v>

245
00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.810
<v Speaker 2>all the stuff that we know about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

246
00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:22.880
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's important about being a human </v>

247
00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:25.101
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We shouldn't invest some resources into </v>

248
00:11:25.101 --> 00:11:27.351
<v Speaker 2>that and developing human beings in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>way and if you're going to provide them </v>

249
00:11:27.351 --> 00:11:30.781
<v Speaker 2>with free healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>should also provide them with some sort </v>

250
00:11:30.781 --> 00:11:33.201
<v Speaker 2>of an education and some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some actually acceptable form where </v>

251
00:11:34.141 --> 00:11:39.141
<v Speaker 2>they're going to really absorb it of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you're doing to your body stupid </v>

252
00:11:39.141 --> 00:11:39.600
<v Speaker 2>and taxpayers shouldn't be paying for </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

253
00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:44.720
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we might have to put you in a state </v>

254
00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.780
<v Speaker 2>where everybody eats big macs for magic </v>
<v Speaker 2>force you into some place.</v>

255
00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:46.410
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna,</v>

256
00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:48.930
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna have to move to South </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dakota because that's the big Mac state.</v>

257
00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.500
<v Speaker 2>You want to keep eating big macs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

258
00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.290
<v Speaker 2>well you can still be on the government </v>
<v Speaker 2>nipple.</v>

259
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:54.020
<v Speaker 2>I was writing a at one point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

260
00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:59.090
<v Speaker 1>that was kind of like that where it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>some detective and he starts realizing </v>

261
00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:00.850
<v Speaker 1>that there's some people just keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappearing and you know,</v>

262
00:12:00.851 --> 00:12:05.851
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a missing persons case and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of turns into like a lot of </v>

263
00:12:05.851 --> 00:12:06.190
<v Speaker 1>missing people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he started kind of looking over,</v>

264
00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of put the board up.</v>

265
00:12:07.511 --> 00:12:10.600
<v Speaker 1>They got their faces up there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize all these people that are really</v>

266
00:12:10.601 --> 00:12:14.800
<v Speaker 1>large and then all sudden it turned into</v>
<v Speaker 1>this total saifai thing where it's like,</v>

267
00:12:14.801 --> 00:12:17.530
<v Speaker 1>actually the aliens have like kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>infiltrated the government.</v>

268
00:12:17.531 --> 00:12:19.660
<v Speaker 1>They've like engineered this and hear </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

269
00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:23.710
<v Speaker 1>The corn products saw the syrup and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're basically like,</v>

270
00:12:23.711 --> 00:12:24.580
<v Speaker 1>the government's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

271
00:12:24.581 --> 00:12:25.150
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

272
00:12:25.151 --> 00:12:30.151
<v Speaker 1>for whatever technology will will take </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and we'll feed our people this and </v>

273
00:12:30.151 --> 00:12:32.380
<v Speaker 1>the aliens are harvesting the fat people</v>
<v Speaker 1>put in their rocket ships to</v>

274
00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:38.860
<v Speaker 2>tailor our,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their rocket ships like whale oil or </v>

275
00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:41.560
<v Speaker 2>fossil fuels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we'll just kind of harvesting why </v>

276
00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:41.560
<v Speaker 2>not orange people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had this,</v>

277
00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.190
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said Rob Wolf yesterday,</v>

278
00:12:43.191 --> 00:12:45.230
<v Speaker 2>the author,</v>
<v Speaker 2>author of the Paleo Solution,</v>

279
00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:46.340
<v Speaker 2>brilliant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brilliant guy,</v>

280
00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:51.610
<v Speaker 2>but what he was talking about government</v>
<v Speaker 2>subsidies and corn and the reason why </v>

281
00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:53.000
<v Speaker 2>there's so much corn out there and corn </v>
<v Speaker 2>syrup and it's used in so many different</v>

282
00:12:53.001 --> 00:12:54.920
<v Speaker 2>things and it's so terrible for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like.</v>

283
00:12:54.921 --> 00:12:57.220
<v Speaker 2>And it's not even economically feasible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

284
00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:00.350
<v Speaker 2>the government is actually paying these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to grow this shit because there's</v>

285
00:13:00.351 --> 00:13:02.960
<v Speaker 2>not a lot of profit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And growing it like somehow or another,</v>

286
00:13:02.961 --> 00:13:07.961
<v Speaker 2>some hustle has bitten,</v>
<v Speaker 2>been put into place and the direct </v>

287
00:13:07.961 --> 00:13:10.010
<v Speaker 2>result of it is a billion fat fucks and </v>
<v Speaker 2>its harvest.</v>

288
00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.830
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing they're coming,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to suck us up,</v>

289
00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:14.240
<v Speaker 2>they're going to put us in a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>engine.</v>

290
00:13:14.241 --> 00:13:15.020
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the twist would be,</v>

291
00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:20.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all of a sudden there's a very </v>

292
00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:20.460
<v Speaker 1>large family and they're not being </v>
<v Speaker 1>harvested like what's going on?</v>

293
00:13:20.461 --> 00:13:21.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's just,</v>

294
00:13:21.210 --> 00:13:22.860
<v Speaker 1>they're genetically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's their,</v>

295
00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:24.830
<v Speaker 1>that's their genetics they had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

296
00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.710
<v Speaker 1>they haven't been fed the corn syrup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they're,</v>

297
00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:30.580
<v Speaker 1>they're just being passed over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it has nothing to do with actual,</v>

298
00:13:30.581 --> 00:13:35.581
<v Speaker 1>like large people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to do with people that are </v>

299
00:13:35.581 --> 00:13:36.240
<v Speaker 1>specifically like gorging on the corn </v>
<v Speaker 1>syrup.</v>

300
00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we really do encounter alien life and</v>

301
00:13:39.631 --> 00:13:42.750
<v Speaker 2>that alien life actually eats biological</v>
<v Speaker 2>matter,</v>

302
00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.450
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be fucked just the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

303
00:13:45.451 --> 00:13:47.250
<v Speaker 2>Pigs are fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same.</v>

304
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:52.430
<v Speaker 2>Pigs are fucking smart man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stopped eating pork for a couple of </v>

305
00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:54.510
<v Speaker 2>months once a couple of years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>

306
00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.120
<v Speaker 2>like a nightmare.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty rough time.</v>

307
00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.290
<v Speaker 2>I saw my brother's keeper talk to you </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

308
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:02.040
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Talk to you anymore.</v>

309
00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:04.200
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever seen the documentary?</v>
<v Speaker 2>My brother's keeper.</v>

310
00:14:04.201 --> 00:14:07.020
<v Speaker 2>It's about these slow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were slow.</v>

311
00:14:07.021 --> 00:14:11.340
<v Speaker 2>They had some sort of a mental </v>
<v Speaker 2>retardation and they ran a farm and I'm.</v>

312
00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:16.550
<v Speaker 2>One of them was accused of a murder or </v>
<v Speaker 2>something heinous and probably most </v>

313
00:14:16.561 --> 00:14:18.510
<v Speaker 2>likely been pinned on them because they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were slow.</v>

314
00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:20.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys running the farm,</v>

315
00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:23.320
<v Speaker 2>they went to kill a pig when they pulled</v>
<v Speaker 2>out the shotgun,</v>

316
00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:29.100
<v Speaker 2>the shotgun and the pig is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>running left and right.</v>

317
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:34.670
<v Speaker 2>Trying to get away from this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It recognizing the gun and freaks out </v>

318
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:35.470
<v Speaker 2>and filing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gets out and shoots and I'm.</v>

319
00:14:35.471 --> 00:14:36.660
<v Speaker 2>I remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

320
00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:41.690
<v Speaker 2>pinks are fucking so I can't be in pigs </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you could shoot a cow in front </v>

321
00:14:41.690 --> 00:14:43.410
<v Speaker 2>of another cow and then the other cows </v>
<v Speaker 2>barely react and be like,</v>

322
00:14:43.411 --> 00:14:44.190
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

323
00:14:44.191 --> 00:14:45.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't have a problem with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm like,</v>

324
00:14:45.630 --> 00:14:50.630
<v Speaker 2>shooting that pig is kind of fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The aliens are going to treat us just </v>

325
00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:51.320
<v Speaker 2>like all due.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Respect my,</v>

326
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:52.450
<v Speaker 2>my boat.</v>

327
00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:53.840
<v Speaker 3>You know my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my pig brother,</v>

328
00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:58.970
<v Speaker 3>Bacon dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apparently the slow cooking method,</v>

329
00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
<v Speaker 3>robb wolf was explaining is the shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're supposed to put a grill electric </v>

330
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.770
<v Speaker 3>grill on 200 and cooker for two hours </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the Bacon becomes insane.</v>

331
00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.930
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not ready to commit to that.</v>

332
00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:11.600
<v Speaker 3>The crispy sounds great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like an asshole.</v>

333
00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:14.690
<v Speaker 3>Like he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'd be like an incense.</v>

334
00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:19.720
<v Speaker 3>Almost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your whole house would smell like bacon </v>

335
00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:19.720
<v Speaker 3>for two hours while it cooks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

336
00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.170
<v Speaker 3>That's a good way to become a fat fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>twitching,</v>

337
00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:24.320
<v Speaker 3>but if there are aliens and they are a </v>
<v Speaker 3>million years more advanced than us,</v>

338
00:15:24.321 --> 00:15:29.120
<v Speaker 3>they're going to eat the shit out of our</v>
<v Speaker 3>folk law for the stuffing ourselves with</v>

339
00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:32.710
<v Speaker 3>all this fast food and car and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're grain fed cattle.</v>

340
00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:36.140
<v Speaker 3>Cattle aren't supposed to eat grain near</v>
<v Speaker 3>neither people and those are.</v>

341
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.060
<v Speaker 3>That's what they had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They finished them on that shit.</v>

342
00:15:38.061 --> 00:15:41.530
<v Speaker 3>That's all nice and fat and juicy </v>
<v Speaker 3>furniture finish him.</v>

343
00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:44.120
<v Speaker 3>Are you still working on a perfect </v>
<v Speaker 3>circle at all?</v>

344
00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:49.130
<v Speaker 3>Are we ever going to see another album?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I know for a while you were </v>

345
00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:50.630
<v Speaker 3>working on something and then it kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>dissolved into.</v>

346
00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.240
<v Speaker 3>I don't know even know what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>

347
00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.130
<v Speaker 3>but you never know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's always,</v>

348
00:15:55.280 --> 00:16:00.280
<v Speaker 3>there's always possibilities.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My ex girlfriend had a perfect circle </v>

349
00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.671
<v Speaker 3>tattoo and I always had to look at it </v>
<v Speaker 3>every time it was right on her butt.</v>

350
00:16:04.291 --> 00:16:06.560
<v Speaker 3>So every time I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not very comfortable.</v>

351
00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:11.060
<v Speaker 3>So let's go back to when the power went </v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

352
00:16:11.061 --> 00:16:12.410
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We were talking about Hicks.</v>

353
00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:15.370
<v Speaker 3>You guys put Hicks on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

354
00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:18.530
<v Speaker 3>you thanked him on a cd because you got </v>
<v Speaker 3>ahold of one of his,</v>

355
00:16:18.531 --> 00:16:20.720
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cassettes and you enjoyed it and,</v>

356
00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:22.820
<v Speaker 3>but you never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys never actually toured together.</v>

357
00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:23.640
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we closed,</v>

358
00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:25.670
<v Speaker 3>we planned on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was basically a plan.</v>

359
00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:29.540
<v Speaker 3>We were kind of setting into motion in </v>
<v Speaker 3>like mid 93,</v>

360
00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.510
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking and that's when it's time when,</v>

361
00:16:32.511 --> 00:16:34.790
<v Speaker 3>when he came down and it was kind of </v>
<v Speaker 3>part of why he was coming down.</v>

362
00:16:34.791 --> 00:16:36.080
<v Speaker 3>We're trying to figure out what we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to do.</v>

363
00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.350
<v Speaker 3>Comedians and rock musicians like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

364
00:16:39.351 --> 00:16:44.351
<v Speaker 3>it's a weird combination of bobcat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Goldthwait did a lot of work with </v>

365
00:16:44.351 --> 00:16:45.230
<v Speaker 3>Nirvana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He opened up for them.</v>

366
00:16:45.231 --> 00:16:50.231
<v Speaker 3>We come in here and he told some </v>
<v Speaker 3>hilarious stories about them just </v>

367
00:16:50.231 --> 00:16:52.850
<v Speaker 3>fucking and shit at him screaming at him</v>
<v Speaker 3>and fucking murder in their eyes.</v>

368
00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.660
<v Speaker 3>Fucking state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's friends with them and they want him</v>

369
00:16:56.661 --> 00:16:58.400
<v Speaker 3>to go out there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

370
00:16:58.401 --> 00:16:58.960
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I,</v>

371
00:16:59.020 --> 00:16:59.980
<v Speaker 3>I actually approached,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

372
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:01.550
<v Speaker 3>David Cross a couple of years ago,</v>

376
00:17:06.501 --> 00:17:08.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to eat dick in front of a</v>

377

<v Speaker 3>It was all weird combination.</v>

379
00:17:13.911 --> 00:17:16.690
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're not providing them what</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're there to see you.</v>

384
00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:28.460
<v Speaker 3>project,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because it's,</v>

385
00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:29.170
<v Speaker 3>it's just that there's just all this </v>
<v Speaker 3>different stuff going on.</v>

386
00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:32.600
<v Speaker 3>You've got film and you've got your </v>
<v Speaker 3>video and you've got animation,</v>

387
00:17:32.601 --> 00:17:36.890

<v Speaker 3>So that's just.</v>

390
00:17:38.811 --> 00:17:41.180
<v Speaker 3>And then in the middle of our study </v>
<v Speaker 3>would come out and interrupt and go,</v>

391
00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:46.190
<v Speaker 3>I forgot a joke and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just from the audience out for a minute </v>

392
00:17:46.641 --> 00:17:50.220

<v Speaker 3>drink and my chair</v>

<v Speaker 2>So jealous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to buy one so bad at talking </v>

399
00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:10.320
<v Speaker 2>about getting one as a portable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A podcast studio.</v>

400
00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:11.110
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should do,</v>

401
00:18:11.130 --> 00:18:13.440
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then come to people's towns and do.</v>

402
00:18:13.810 --> 00:18:18.810
<v Speaker 2>Because we could have a four G,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four g connection for verizon.</v>

403
00:18:18.961 --> 00:18:21.920
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty Goddamn sporty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If we just find a place that can support</v>

404
00:18:21.921 --> 00:18:23.710
<v Speaker 2>the show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we would have to have a.</v>

405
00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:29.030
<v Speaker 2>We would have to have one for each show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we'd have to have a contract for </v>

406
00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:29.040
<v Speaker 2>each show because then we'd go over our </v>
<v Speaker 2>data.</v>

407
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:33.210
<v Speaker 2>So it would have to get like 50 of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would have to get a sponsor.</v>

408
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:36.450
<v Speaker 2>Will this team ting wants a sponsor of </v>
<v Speaker 2>something new,</v>

409
00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:39.900

<v Speaker 2>Maybe they could do that.</v>

410
00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:40.500
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's cool.</v>

<v Speaker 2>when you got into Hex for me,</v>

413
00:18:45.151 --> 00:18:50.151
<v Speaker 2>I was a young comedian living in Boston </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was working at the comedy </v>

414
00:18:50.701 --> 00:18:55.701
<v Speaker 2>connection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had been doing it probably about a </v>

415
00:18:55.701 --> 00:18:55.701
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was probably like 1989.</v>

416
00:18:55.701 --> 00:18:57.180
<v Speaker 2>Would you live in Boston?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I live in Newton.</v>

417
00:18:58.090 --> 00:18:59.850
<v Speaker 2>I live in Davis Square.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did you really?</v>

418
00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:00.480
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

419
00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:02.880
<v Speaker 2>I used to work at Boston pet center down</v>
<v Speaker 2>on leach mere.</v>

420
00:19:03.090 --> 00:19:04.430
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not there anymore.</v>

421
00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:06.480
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some awful something there.</v>

422
00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:09.420
<v Speaker 2>Boston is a great place to grow up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a terrible place to die.</v>

423
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:13.020
<v Speaker 2>And I felt like I was dying there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

424
00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.730
<v Speaker 2>It's like the people are cool.</v>

425
00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:16.440
<v Speaker 2>They're smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting.</v>

426
00:19:16.441 --> 00:19:18.450
<v Speaker 2>It's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a real town,</v>

427
00:19:18.451 --> 00:19:21.390
<v Speaker 2>but it's too fucking cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just too fucking old.</v>

428
00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:26.450
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like I kind of feel like there's a </v>

429
00:19:26.450 --> 00:19:27.090
<v Speaker 2>parallel between San Francisco and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Boston in a way.</v>

430
00:19:27.091 --> 00:19:30.990
<v Speaker 2>As far as that bitter cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's take San Fran everyday son.</v>

431
00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:36.110
<v Speaker 2>I'll take San Fran all day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like San Fran have maybe 100 times </v>

432
00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:36.820
<v Speaker 2>better than Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I and I,</v>

433
00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:38.180
<v Speaker 2>I guess like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

434
00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:41.430
<v Speaker 2>I'll take that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

435
00:19:41.431 --> 00:19:44.290
<v Speaker 2>I think the sand France had just changed</v>
<v Speaker 2>their licensed places.</v>

436
00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.310
<v Speaker 2>Say you're doing it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

437
00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:49.580
<v Speaker 2>You think they're doing it wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They just know what you're doing.</v>

438
00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:51.690
<v Speaker 2>No matter what you're doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing it wrong.</v>

439
00:19:51.710 --> 00:19:52.340
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

440
00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:57.400
<v Speaker 2>they go over the deep end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they go over my preferable and that </v>

441
00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:58.350
<v Speaker 2>goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go over the lefty deepen,</v>

442
00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:02.370
<v Speaker 2>which seems weird coming from like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>cage fighting commentator type dude.</v>

443
00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:04.170
<v Speaker 2>But I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

444
00:20:04.171 --> 00:20:09.171
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like people that are kind and I think </v>

445
00:20:09.171 --> 00:20:11.721
<v Speaker 2>that even if the people on the left are </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it the wrong way and even if </v>

446
00:20:11.721 --> 00:20:13.440
<v Speaker 2>they're crazy and self righteous and </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretentious,</v>

447
00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:18.860
<v Speaker 2>I think the idea behind it is they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to be as kind to as many groups </v>

448
00:20:18.991 --> 00:20:23.991
<v Speaker 2>of people you know and offer a </v>
<v Speaker 2>commensurate environment for as many </v>

449
00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:30.140
<v Speaker 2>groups of people as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I support that even though I think a </v>

450
00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:32.961
<v Speaker 2>lot of what they think is nonsense and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't go along with human nature </v>

451
00:20:32.961 --> 00:20:37.260
<v Speaker 2>and behavior and Alpha them sometimes it</v>
<v Speaker 2>grabbed their neck and shake them like a</v>

452
00:20:37.261 --> 00:20:40.740
<v Speaker 2>fucking child and we'll get it to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>that bitch do some squats,</v>

453
00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:43.200
<v Speaker 2>have a fucking stake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

454
00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:46.280
<v Speaker 2>you're on planet Earth Bacon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get up,</v>

455
00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:48.780
<v Speaker 2>bitch up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have a fucking shot of whiskey.</v>

456
00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:52.460
<v Speaker 2>Let's do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just a Boston is just a,</v>

457
00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:56.470
<v Speaker 2>a Boston is liberal in the same way too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just angry.</v>

459
00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:02.210

<v Speaker 2>There was some Irish anger going on </v>

460
00:21:02.210 --> 00:21:02.330
<v Speaker 2>there and ugly cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>there and like it was like one of my </v>

462
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:07.350
<v Speaker 2>first times back in Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

463
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:09.270
<v Speaker 2>back be back in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dry capital</v>

00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:23.500
<v Speaker 2>Capital of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to find a good one in Boston.</v>

469
00:21:23.501 --> 00:21:28.501
<v Speaker 2>And when you find a good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you cling to them like a cork in </v>

470
00:21:28.501 --> 00:21:28.501
<v Speaker 2>the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please keep me afloat,</v>

471
00:21:28.501 --> 00:21:29.930
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

472
00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:33.160
<v Speaker 2>I saw him at the comedy connection and </v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

473
00:21:33.161 --> 00:21:37.110
<v Speaker 2>I saw him because he was on the Rodney </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dangerfield special and uh,</v>

474
00:21:37.111 --> 00:21:39.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was an aspiring comedian.</v>

475
00:21:39.271 --> 00:21:44.271
<v Speaker 2>So I went to see everybody was on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rodney dangerfield special when they </v>

476
00:21:44.271 --> 00:21:44.580
<v Speaker 2>came through town and Boston was one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those pit stops.</v>

477
00:21:44.581 --> 00:21:45.960
<v Speaker 2>It was like Chicago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boston,</v>

478
00:21:45.961 --> 00:21:47.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was places where people would come</v>

479
00:21:47.341 --> 00:21:52.341
<v Speaker 2>through and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would guarantee that they would be </v>

480
00:21:52.341 --> 00:21:52.680
<v Speaker 2>in your town eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

481
00:21:53.820 --> 00:21:56.580
<v Speaker 2>Hicks went up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he went up at the comedy connection,</v>

482
00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:01.730
<v Speaker 2>or the first time I actually saw him was</v>
<v Speaker 2>at Nick's comedy stop and he went up </v>

483
00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:02.820
<v Speaker 2>after this guy was incredible hack.</v>

484
00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:06.080
<v Speaker 2>The guy was like cop donut jokes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cartoons,</v>

485
00:22:06.081 --> 00:22:10.050
<v Speaker 2>smoking pot and make them all the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>hackneyed obvious premises.</v>

486
00:22:10.051 --> 00:22:12.660
<v Speaker 2>And he was killing audiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>filled idiots.</v>

487
00:22:12.661 --> 00:22:17.661
<v Speaker 2>Nobody knew who Hicks was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me and maybe 50 other comedians in the </v>

488
00:22:17.661 --> 00:22:21.021
<v Speaker 2>back of the room at a 300 people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>were in the audience places packed by 20</v>

489
00:22:21.571 --> 00:22:24.090
<v Speaker 2>minutes into the show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Half the people have left,</v>

490
00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:26.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean literally cleared out at least 50</v>

491
00:22:26.701 --> 00:22:31.701
<v Speaker 2>percent by the end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was maybe 100 people left and it was </v>

492
00:22:31.701 --> 00:22:33.480
<v Speaker 2>a 50 audience members in 50 comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we.</v>

493
00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.560
<v Speaker 2>And he didn't give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He never came.</v>

494
00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:39.690
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one joke would go wrong for me.</v>

495
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:42.900
<v Speaker 2>I would go into a tailspin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would panic,</v>

496
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:44.140
<v Speaker 2>I would go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Duh.</v>

497
00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:47.520
<v Speaker 2>I would rush my jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say fuck too much.</v>

498
00:22:47.521 --> 00:22:48.240
<v Speaker 2>I would just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would,</v>

499
00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:52.350
<v Speaker 2>I would not have any confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's in the middle of this bit about how</v>

500
00:22:52.351 --> 00:22:56.280
<v Speaker 2>Satan fugs John Davidson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who don't remember John Davidson,</v>

501
00:22:56.281 --> 00:22:57.770
<v Speaker 2>was the host of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>

502
00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.680
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was the,</v>

503
00:22:59.730 --> 00:23:01.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of them,</v>

504
00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:03.180
<v Speaker 2>it was like the Internet before there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was the internet,</v>

505
00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:08.300
<v Speaker 2>so it's a demon with his thorny cock is </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking John Davidson in the ass and </v>

506
00:23:10.741 --> 00:23:15.741
<v Speaker 2>John Davidson swells up and the off </v>
<v Speaker 2>season because he's pregnant with </v>

507
00:23:15.741 --> 00:23:18.250
<v Speaker 2>Lucifer's baby and he shits out Oprah </v>
<v Speaker 2>Winfrey or,</v>

508
00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:21.780
<v Speaker 2>or Geraldo Rivera depending on where </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hicks was at.</v>

509
00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:25.560
<v Speaker 2>And so hicks is standing onstage </v>
<v Speaker 2>shitting.</v>

510
00:23:25.950 --> 00:23:27.150
<v Speaker 2>So he's pausing going,</v>

511
00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:35.620
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's fucking minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 minutes of just just straining and </v>

512
00:23:36.531 --> 00:23:40.040
<v Speaker 3>people just getting up and leaving and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he looks up in the middle of it goes.</v>

513
00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:45.860
<v Speaker 3>It's usually clears the room.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're</v>

514
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:51.010
<v Speaker 2>just flying in and I got to see him bomb</v>
<v Speaker 2>horribly but yet still kill for 50 to </v>

515
00:23:54.141 --> 00:23:55.300
<v Speaker 2>100 people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I got,</v>

516
00:23:55.301 --> 00:23:57.860
<v Speaker 2>I got him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You kill for the whole,</v>

517
00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:01.820
<v Speaker 2>the whole crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what an interesting guy.</v>

518
00:24:01.821 --> 00:24:05.330
<v Speaker 2>It's like he was doing something that </v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody else was doing.</v>

519
00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:08.340
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was injecting Noam Chomsky and,</v>

520
00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:08.850
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

521
00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.720
<v Speaker 2>and philosophy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Terence Mckenna.</v>

522
00:24:11.721 --> 00:24:13.370
<v Speaker 2>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

523
00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:18.380
<v Speaker 2>Like I didn't even like when I first saw</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kennison kinison was the first time I </v>

524
00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:19.860
<v Speaker 2>ever thought I could do comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

525
00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:24.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw these guys rolling up their </v>

526
00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:24.940
<v Speaker 2>sleeves talking about did you ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>notice?</v>

527
00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:27.380
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I kinda Kinda could do that.</v>

528
00:24:27.381 --> 00:24:29.390
<v Speaker 2>I guess I kind of could do that if I had</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do that.</v>

529
00:24:29.630 --> 00:24:32.450
<v Speaker 2>But then I saw kinison and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

530
00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:37.480
<v Speaker 2>fucking came and I was married and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was angry and it was funny and I was </v>

531
00:24:38.241 --> 00:24:38.660
<v Speaker 2>laughing.</v>

532
00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:43.660
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe that maybe there's a comedy for </v>

533
00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:43.660
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I could find my comedy.</v>

534
00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:44.950
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then when I saw him,</v>

535
00:24:44.980 --> 00:24:46.250
<v Speaker 2>so I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

536
00:24:46.251 --> 00:24:49.760
<v Speaker 2>this guy just flipped the whole fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing on its head.</v>

537
00:24:49.761 --> 00:24:52.220
<v Speaker 2>Like now it's now it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

538
00:24:52.221 --> 00:24:57.221
<v Speaker 2>it's about formulating a philosophy on </v>
<v Speaker 2>life and that there is a possibility </v>

539
00:24:58.341 --> 00:25:00.530
<v Speaker 2>outside of the direction that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>going in.</v>

540
00:25:00.531 --> 00:25:03.590
<v Speaker 2>And then it is possible for the human </v>
<v Speaker 2>beings and the,</v>

541
00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:04.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

542
00:25:04.101 --> 00:25:06.640
<v Speaker 2>the human civilization to rise up and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

543
00:25:06.641 --> 00:25:09.050
<v Speaker 2>and be about love and be about </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding.</v>

544
00:25:09.051 --> 00:25:14.030
<v Speaker 2>It'd be about intellectual curiosity and</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be free of judgment.</v>

545
00:25:14.031 --> 00:25:16.120
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy's a fucking comedian.</v>

546
00:25:16.121 --> 00:25:18.170
<v Speaker 2>Like this is the craziest Shit I've ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen.</v>

547
00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:23.700
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like his jokes were an </v>
<v Speaker 2>afterthought to inject this philosophy </v>

548
00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:23.930
<v Speaker 2>into the audience.</v>

549
00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:24.950
<v Speaker 1>I think partly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

550
00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:27.750
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I've loved.</v>

551
00:25:27.751 --> 00:25:28.150
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

552
00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:33.170
<v Speaker 1>I kind of like a spend a little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I spent all the time in that little </v>

553
00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:37.431
<v Speaker 1>comedy world for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was very always very inspiring to me to </v>

554
00:25:37.431 --> 00:25:40.191
<v Speaker 1>watch comedians like him basically just </v>
<v Speaker 1>stick to their guns and finish their ach</v>

555
00:25:40.321 --> 00:25:42.030
<v Speaker 1>without getting that nervous sweat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

556
00:25:42.031 --> 00:25:47.031
<v Speaker 1>it was always inspiring to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's always my favorite comedy clubs</v>

557
00:25:48.061 --> 00:25:49.540
<v Speaker 1>to go to were the ones that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

558
00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.350
<v Speaker 1>you end up if you're sitting out front </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

559

<v Speaker 1>comedy club,</v>

561

<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

562
00:25:59.700 --> 00:26:02.760
<v Speaker 1>he can like take bets to see how quickly</v>
<v Speaker 1>the room's going to clear.</v>

563
00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:09.680

<v Speaker 1>a whole,</v>

567
00:26:17.761 --> 00:26:20.730
<v Speaker 1>like a debunking comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't understand.</v>

573
00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.270
<v Speaker 1>Like that's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that hack?</v>

574
00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:37.620
<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

575
00:26:37.740 --> 00:26:42.740
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that whole thing went on for like an </v>

576
00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:42.740
<v Speaker 1>hour,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour and a half.</v>

577
00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:42.740
<v Speaker 1>I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the back of the room,</v>

578
00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:43.950
<v Speaker 1>just peeing myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Them go through this.</v>

579
00:26:43.951 --> 00:26:44.100
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

580
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:49.100
<v Speaker 2>then some dude gets out after them as </v>
<v Speaker 2>their act and does everything that they </v>

581
00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:50.070
<v Speaker 2>just went through and the audience is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

582
00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.890
<v Speaker 2>oh that's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can I have another break?</v>

583
00:26:54.390 --> 00:26:58.140
<v Speaker 2>And then David Cross gets up and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>just clears the room was awesome.</v>

584
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:00.840
<v Speaker 2>Opening line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

585
00:27:00.841 --> 00:27:02.660
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw Schindler's list the other day,</v>

586
00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:05.940
<v Speaker 2>Schindler's list finally saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that funny.</v>

587
00:27:07.050 --> 00:27:09.570
<v Speaker 2>This whole table of people just get up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and out the door like,</v>

588
00:27:09.571 --> 00:27:10.980
<v Speaker 2>and it just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every joke that he said,</v>

589
00:27:10.981 --> 00:27:15.981
<v Speaker 2>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're watching like me just set off a </v>

590
00:27:15.981 --> 00:27:15.981
<v Speaker 2>bomb there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just set off a bomb.</v>

591
00:27:15.981 --> 00:27:17.890
<v Speaker 2>They cleared the room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was Crosses,</v>

592
00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:23.210
<v Speaker 2>rarely credited,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in my opinion of watching it all </v>

593
00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:26.211
<v Speaker 2>happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the originator of the idea of </v>

594
00:27:26.211 --> 00:27:27.660
<v Speaker 2>alternative comedy because I saw him do </v>
<v Speaker 2>an alternative comedy in 1988.</v>

595
00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:32.460
<v Speaker 2>He was in Boston and Cambridge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would go up and he would do,</v>

596
00:27:32.790 --> 00:27:34.800
<v Speaker 2>I remember one time he was doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

597
00:27:34.801 --> 00:27:37.620
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise video where would teach you,</v>

598
00:27:37.650 --> 00:27:39.060
<v Speaker 2>teach you how to stretch.</v>

599
00:27:39.330 --> 00:27:41.430
<v Speaker 2>So you've played the exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Video districts.</v>

600
00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:46.600
<v Speaker 2>I really do feel a stretch and he was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like doing this like long and people </v>

601
00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:50.790
<v Speaker 2>like nervously giggling and not showing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were not sure where it was going and it </v>

602
00:27:50.790 --> 00:27:52.430
<v Speaker 2>never went anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It never went anywhere.</v>

603
00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.630
<v Speaker 2>But it was amusing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt,</v>

604
00:27:54.631 --> 00:27:59.631
<v Speaker 2>I felt he was like a better version of </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I'm Andy Kaufman was doing because </v>

605
00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:04.940
<v Speaker 2>Andy Kaufman would get up in front of </v>
<v Speaker 2>like colleges and like read the great </v>

606
00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:05.880
<v Speaker 2>gatsby and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's Kinda fucked.</v>

607
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:09.150
<v Speaker 2>It's not really funny at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this is kind of crazy.</v>

608
00:28:09.151 --> 00:28:10.980
<v Speaker 2>Like it is now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is now.</v>

609
00:28:11.010 --> 00:28:16.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a delayed reaction to like </v>

610
00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:17.160
<v Speaker 2>witness it as great longterm absorption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Cross was.</v>

611
00:28:17.220 --> 00:28:18.870
<v Speaker 2>He was funny while I was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

612
00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:20.790
<v Speaker 2>it was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was just so silly.</v>

613
00:28:21.030 --> 00:28:22.680
<v Speaker 2>It was actually funny while he was doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

614
00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:28.100
<v Speaker 2>Do you like comedy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like music because I'm completely </v>

615
00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:30.720
<v Speaker 2>unmusical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any skill.</v>

616
00:28:30.721 --> 00:28:32.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any talent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have.</v>

617
00:28:33.150 --> 00:28:35.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't see those bars.</v>

618
00:28:35.581 --> 00:28:38.490
<v Speaker 2>That might as well be Tibetan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

619
00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:40.470
<v Speaker 2>Sanskrit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is.</v>

620
00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:43.960
<v Speaker 2>So when I see someone perform music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I,</v>

621
00:28:44.010 --> 00:28:45.720
<v Speaker 2>when I'm in awe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

622
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:48.360
<v Speaker 2>to me it's a beautiful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wonderful experience.</v>

623
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:51.570
<v Speaker 2>Do you feel the same way about comedy </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you don't do comedy?</v>

624
00:28:51.571 --> 00:28:56.571
<v Speaker 2>Do you watch comedy and just get a free </v>
<v Speaker 2>sense of enjoyment that you might not </v>

625
00:28:56.571 --> 00:28:58.080
<v Speaker 2>get from watching something that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>

626
00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:03.620
<v Speaker 2>I generally enjoy more scripted like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>film comedy when I see a group of guys </v>

627
00:29:03.961 --> 00:29:06.590
<v Speaker 2>who have figured out not a formula,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's just a,</v>

628
00:29:06.690 --> 00:29:11.690
<v Speaker 2>there's a rhythm to their comedy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've actually created a character </v>

629
00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:11.690
<v Speaker 2>behind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

630
00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:14.460
<v Speaker 2>that actor brings something to the table</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you want to look at.</v>

631
00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:19.700
<v Speaker 2>And then their timing in this scenario </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's clearly there are just play </v>

632
00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:19.700
<v Speaker 2>acting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

633
00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:24.081
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're just playing dress up pretend and </v>

634
00:29:24.081 --> 00:29:24.081
<v Speaker 2>you still laugh because the writing </v>
<v Speaker 2>solid,</v>

635
00:29:24.081 --> 00:29:28.761
<v Speaker 2>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they bring to the table with their </v>

636
00:29:28.761 --> 00:29:28.761
<v Speaker 2>writing is solid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So like,</v>

637
00:29:28.761 --> 00:29:28.761
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're seeing things like,</v>

638
00:29:28.761 --> 00:29:30.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the movie super troopers,</v>

639
00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:35.060
<v Speaker 2>it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those guys had to have a lot of fun </v>

640
00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:35.060
<v Speaker 2>making that film because everything was </v>
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

641
00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:36.930
<v Speaker 2>the writing was perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a quotable film.</v>

642
00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:38.760
<v Speaker 2>It's like every step of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's every,</v>

643
00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:41.980
<v Speaker 2>every scene is quotable and they're </v>
<v Speaker 2>having fun.</v>

644
00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:43.260
<v Speaker 1>And then you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

645
00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:46.600
<v Speaker 1>almost almost any will farrell brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those guys just.</v>

646
00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:47.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

647
00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:52.920
<v Speaker 1>John C dot reilly's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just a master at just bringing his </v>

648
00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.580
<v Speaker 1>thing to the table and then making your </v>
<v Speaker 1>script come alive.</v>

649
00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:57.130
<v Speaker 1>It's just a great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That to me is like,</v>

650
00:29:57.131 --> 00:29:58.510
<v Speaker 1>and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I look at that and I go,</v>

651
00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:03.990
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck did you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have no idea how they did that and I </v>

652
00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:07.081
<v Speaker 1>have no idea how to be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just saw I'm watching them just like </v>

653
00:30:07.081 --> 00:30:09.930
<v Speaker 1>nail these things out of the park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you could put all that script on </v>

654
00:30:09.930 --> 00:30:09.930
<v Speaker 1>the paper and show it to me and I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>just go,</v>

655
00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:12.160
<v Speaker 1>which I don't have where to start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

656
00:30:12.190 --> 00:30:13.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is this funny?</v>

657
00:30:13.810 --> 00:30:18.070
<v Speaker 2>One of my favorite all time Comedians is</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mitch Hedberg and one of the reasons why</v>

658
00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:21.250
<v Speaker 2>Mitch is one of my favorites is because </v>
<v Speaker 2>none of his stuff was funny on paper.</v>

659
00:30:21.550 --> 00:30:24.460
<v Speaker 2>It didn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you would see that he goes,</v>

660
00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:27.790
<v Speaker 2>it was somebody asked me do I want a </v>
<v Speaker 2>frozen banana?</v>

661
00:30:27.910 --> 00:30:28.990
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

662
00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:32.440
<v Speaker 2>but I want a regular banana later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yes.</v>

663
00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:37.000
<v Speaker 2>Now if you saw that on paper and be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

664
00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:39.220
<v Speaker 2>why is that funny?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is,</v>

665
00:30:39.221 --> 00:30:42.280
<v Speaker 2>I might have butchered his joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it was pretty close,</v>

666
00:30:42.670 --> 00:30:44.410
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that.</v>

667
00:30:44.411 --> 00:30:47.890
<v Speaker 2>I love that he redefined comedy in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>certain way to.</v>

668
00:30:47.891 --> 00:30:48.880
<v Speaker 2>Because he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he made,</v>

669
00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:54.210
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was a heroin addict and he had only </v>

670
00:30:54.210 --> 00:30:56.740
<v Speaker 2>clean comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean his stuff was squeaky clean.</v>

671
00:30:57.510 --> 00:31:02.510
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile he was gang green and his leg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he was fucking shooting in this </v>

672
00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:03.370
<v Speaker 2>same vein too many times.</v>

673
00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:08.860
<v Speaker 2>It was really a strange guy and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>material was all so odd and if you loved</v>

674
00:31:13.021 --> 00:31:17.440
<v Speaker 2>Mitch Hedberg it was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like Mitch Hedberg would go on after</v>

675
00:31:17.441 --> 00:31:21.320
<v Speaker 2>these guys that would like sing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>dance and do song parodies and you know,</v>

676
00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:24.460
<v Speaker 2>they would close with a rap and he would</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat dick.</v>

677
00:31:24.610 --> 00:31:29.610
<v Speaker 2>He would eat dick so bad that the club </v>
<v Speaker 2>owner would try to switch him with the </v>

678
00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:30.600
<v Speaker 2>Middle Act and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

679
00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:33.220
<v Speaker 2>the Middle East has been doing stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have him close.</v>

680
00:31:33.221 --> 00:31:35.250
<v Speaker 2>We're going to give him your money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they're,</v>

681
00:31:35.251 --> 00:31:40.251
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his manager would call it and it'd be </v>

682
00:31:40.251 --> 00:31:41.880
<v Speaker 2>like a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it wasn't necessarily that he was a </v>

683
00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.000
<v Speaker 2>not a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a funny comic,</v>

684
00:31:43.001 --> 00:31:47.950
<v Speaker 2>it was like it was completely the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>setup for his type of comedy.</v>

685
00:31:47.951 --> 00:31:52.951
<v Speaker 2>Whereas it's a delicate environment </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you could take a guy like Kennis </v>

686
00:31:52.951 --> 00:31:53.560
<v Speaker 2>and it didn't matter who went on before </v>
<v Speaker 2>him,</v>

687
00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:58.710
<v Speaker 2>when he stormed out of this fucking room</v>
<v Speaker 2>has changed.</v>

688
00:31:59.351 --> 00:32:04.351
<v Speaker 2>The environment has changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hedberg would get up there with </v>

689
00:32:04.351 --> 00:32:04.351
<v Speaker 2>sunglasses on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

690
00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:08.800
<v Speaker 2>and it just goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bear never played tennis against a wall.</v>

691
00:32:08.801 --> 00:32:13.801
<v Speaker 2>They're relentless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would just start giggling and it </v>

692
00:32:16.831 --> 00:32:18.880
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be a slow build.</v>

693
00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.200
<v Speaker 2>And he was one of the rare guys that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have a nonsequitors.</v>

694
00:32:22.210 --> 00:32:24.610
<v Speaker 2>Everything was being nonsequitor every </v>
<v Speaker 2>single bit.</v>

695
00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:27.010
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is that drawing on the wall?</v>

696
00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:32.220
<v Speaker 2>That's a vagina.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what a child would draw like in </v>

697
00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:32.220
<v Speaker 2>high school maybe.</v>

698
00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:36.430
<v Speaker 1>And in Walsh's a drawing of what he </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks Barbie looks like.</v>

699
00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:39.120
<v Speaker 1>And it's right next to Pam Anderson up.</v>

700
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:45.530
<v Speaker 3>We had an artist on one of our other </v>
<v Speaker 3>podcasts to interrupt you,</v>

701
00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:49.580
<v Speaker 3>but I just kept screaming at me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This whole place is a giant distraction.</v>

702
00:32:49.590 --> 00:32:51.260
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a flashlight right here.</v>

703
00:32:51.261 --> 00:32:54.260
<v Speaker 3>Are former sponsor fucking cats all over</v>
<v Speaker 3>the table.</v>

704
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:56.110
<v Speaker 3>Super Mario brothers behind the </v>
<v Speaker 3>appointment.</v>

705
00:32:56.200 --> 00:33:00.350
<v Speaker 3>There's a mannequin tit stormtrooper </v>
<v Speaker 3>helmet.</v>

706
00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:02.480
<v Speaker 3>Ron Paul's in here somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Where's Ron?</v>

707
00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:03.920
<v Speaker 3>Ron?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Paul's over there somewhere.</v>

708
00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:05.900
<v Speaker 3>She's leaving.</v>

709
00:33:06.130 --> 00:33:07.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

710
00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:12.160
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a weird little setup we have </v>

711
00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:12.160
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is what?</v>

712
00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:12.160
<v Speaker 2>That fucking painting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

713
00:33:12.160 --> 00:33:12.810
<v Speaker 2>That's what I've been wanting to ask.</v>

714
00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:16.570
<v Speaker 3>Yours burned that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look far away,</v>

715
00:33:16.571 --> 00:33:18.310
<v Speaker 3>if you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you look at it far away,</v>

716
00:33:18.311 --> 00:33:21.370
<v Speaker 3>it looks like a naked girl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

717
00:33:22.630 --> 00:33:24.730
<v Speaker 3>Thanks Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thanks a lot man.</v>

718
00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:25.780
<v Speaker 3>Appreciate it.</v>

719
00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:29.960
<v Speaker 2>I only said that for humor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really mean that.</v>

720
00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:35.070
<v Speaker 2>So I have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have questions for you and it's a </v>

721
00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:39.190
<v Speaker 2>regarding Anderson Silva.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to know what you think is coming </v>

722
00:33:39.771 --> 00:33:40.360
<v Speaker 2>next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this,</v>

723
00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:42.620
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you on the inside of that?</v>

724
00:33:42.621 --> 00:33:47.621
<v Speaker 2>Is it a what's happening?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most likely it will be one of two </v>

725
00:33:47.621 --> 00:33:52.481
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Depending on what they can talk them </v>

726
00:33:52.481 --> 00:33:54.101
<v Speaker 2>into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anderson is a very rare position where </v>

727
00:33:54.101 --> 00:33:55.070
<v Speaker 2>he sort of gets chooses opponents for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most part.</v>

728
00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.690
<v Speaker 2>It'll be there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

729
00:33:56.750 --> 00:34:01.750
<v Speaker 2>based on like he didn't want to fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chael Sonnen because he talks so much </v>

730
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.750
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't want to do it,</v>

731
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:03.320
<v Speaker 2>but he also did because he wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>silence them,</v>

732
00:34:03.321 --> 00:34:05.630
<v Speaker 2>so they just had a financially motivated</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

733
00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:09.740
<v Speaker 2>It will most likely be either this kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chris Weidman,</v>

734
00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:14.690
<v Speaker 2>who's the best up and coming 195 pounds </v>
<v Speaker 2>or one of the best.</v>

735
00:34:14.691 --> 00:34:17.180
<v Speaker 2>He hasn't fought a lot of guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's a,</v>

736
00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:18.590
<v Speaker 2>I think I've heard about stamping.</v>

737
00:34:18.620 --> 00:34:23.620
<v Speaker 2>Pretty solid dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just destroyed Mark Munoz who's also a </v>

738
00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:27.101
<v Speaker 2>top 10 contender.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the way he did it was just so just </v>

739
00:34:27.101 --> 00:34:30.830
<v Speaker 2>complete and total the way he </v>
<v Speaker 2>anticipated all of his moves countered.</v>

740
00:34:30.831 --> 00:34:33.580
<v Speaker 2>I'm almost strangled them three or four </v>
<v Speaker 2>times the first day.</v>

741
00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:34.560
<v Speaker 2>Pretty Young Kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

742
00:34:34.561 --> 00:34:36.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a spectacular wrestler.</v>

743
00:34:36.681 --> 00:34:38.960
<v Speaker 2>So it's him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might get it,</v>

744
00:34:38.961 --> 00:34:41.840
<v Speaker 2>but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a bit of a tough sell because,</v>

745
00:34:41.841 --> 00:34:43.670
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of folks in the mainstream</v>

746
00:34:43.671 --> 00:34:45.710
<v Speaker 2>that don't know who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's more of a,</v>

747
00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:48.620
<v Speaker 2>someone who he.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He can beat Anderson Silva.</v>

748
00:34:48.621 --> 00:34:53.621
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look who the fuck knows what's gonna </v>

749
00:34:53.621 --> 00:34:55.100
<v Speaker 2>actually happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it may be possible that he could </v>

750
00:34:55.100 --> 00:34:55.100
<v Speaker 2>pull it off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has the right set of skills,</v>

751
00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:57.090
<v Speaker 2>but he's not known as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

752
00:34:57.140 --> 00:35:01.280
<v Speaker 2>but the other option is if George St </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pierre Beats Carlos Condit.</v>

753
00:35:01.490 --> 00:35:05.360
<v Speaker 2>Okay then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then they have some fucking crazy Susan.</v>

754
00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:10.540
<v Speaker 2>Is that the guy that they mentioned at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the end of the fight when they were </v>

755
00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:11.900
<v Speaker 2>saying so are you going to fight him?</v>

756
00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:13.970
<v Speaker 2>And he went to find him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

757
00:35:13.971 --> 00:35:15.140
<v Speaker 2>that's John Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

758
00:35:15.141 --> 00:35:15.930
<v Speaker 2>John's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

759
00:35:15.931 --> 00:35:17.270
<v Speaker 2>You said he doesn't want to fight Jon </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jones,</v>

760
00:35:17.271 --> 00:35:20.420
<v Speaker 2>but Jon Jones really isn't a totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>different weight class.</v>

761
00:35:20.450 --> 00:35:23.840
<v Speaker 2>Not just Anderson has dabbled in the 205</v>
<v Speaker 2>pound weight class,</v>

762
00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:26.540
<v Speaker 2>but really he makes one 85 pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>easily.</v>

763
00:35:26.570 --> 00:35:31.570
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't have a problem making one 85 </v>
<v Speaker 2>a and John Jones could never make one </v>

764
00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:32.960
<v Speaker 2>85.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Jones is six foot three,</v>

765
00:35:32.961 --> 00:35:36.740
<v Speaker 2>240 pounds to 30 least when he's walking</v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

766
00:35:36.890 --> 00:35:38.150
<v Speaker 2>And then he cuts down to two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

767
00:35:38.151 --> 00:35:39.360
<v Speaker 2>five slowly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

768
00:35:39.361 --> 00:35:40.510
<v Speaker 2>over his camp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

769
00:35:40.511 --> 00:35:45.511
<v Speaker 2>cut.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably cut my loses the last probably </v>

770
00:35:45.511 --> 00:35:46.170
<v Speaker 2>10 pounds in water weight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just a way bigger guy.</v>

771
00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:51.260
<v Speaker 2>He's way bigger and he's a really strong</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrestler and stylistically he's a </v>

772
00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:53.010
<v Speaker 2>nightmare and apparently they have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mutual admiration for each other.</v>

773
00:35:53.011 --> 00:35:57.150
<v Speaker 2>That's it can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it can be bypassed,</v>

774
00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:02.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the right amount of money and both </v>

775
00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:02.260
<v Speaker 2>guys probably agreed to it if the right </v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of money on the table,</v>

776
00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:03.420
<v Speaker 2>but right now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

777
00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:08.630
<v Speaker 2>they both stated their admiration for </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other and they're probably number </v>

778
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:12.081
<v Speaker 2>one and number two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pound for pound fighters in the world </v>

779
00:36:12.081 --> 00:36:12.081
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

780
00:36:12.081 --> 00:36:14.750
<v Speaker 2>People would like to see that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But honestly I think George St Pierre </v>

781
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:15.630
<v Speaker 2>and Anderson are more physically the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same size.</v>

782
00:36:15.631 --> 00:36:16.580
<v Speaker 2>It's closer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

783
00:36:16.770 --> 00:36:20.620
<v Speaker 2>George has a struggle to make one 70 </v>
<v Speaker 2>whereas Anderson is a,</v>

784
00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:23.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he makes one 85 pretty easy.</v>

785
00:36:23.371 --> 00:36:28.371
<v Speaker 2>George could make one 85 and be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>basically the same size and that would </v>

786
00:36:28.371 --> 00:36:32.391
<v Speaker 2>be an amazing fight that I think if,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if George can get through Carlos condit </v>

787
00:36:32.391 --> 00:36:35.040
<v Speaker 2>and that they believe they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight in the fall,</v>

788
00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:38.490
<v Speaker 2>depending on George's recovering from an</v>
<v Speaker 2>acl surgery.</v>

789
00:36:38.750 --> 00:36:40.570
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>

790
00:36:41.020 --> 00:36:41.960
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had to.</v>

791
00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:45.300
<v Speaker 2>And if George gets through that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's cool that,</v>

792
00:36:45.301 --> 00:36:46.890
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if he beats Carlos Condit,</v>

793
00:36:46.891 --> 00:36:47.910
<v Speaker 2>which is an f,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

794
00:36:47.940 --> 00:36:50.220
<v Speaker 2>Carlos has really good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a very tough.</v>

795
00:36:50.250 --> 00:36:55.250
<v Speaker 2>But if he beats him then they go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably a Dallas stadium,</v>

796
00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:58.680
<v Speaker 2>probably doing that big giant fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>60,000</v>

797
00:36:58.681 --> 00:36:59.970
<v Speaker 2>square foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That'd be awesome.</v>

798
00:37:00.630 --> 00:37:02.330
<v Speaker 2>That'd be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just looking forward to the next,</v>

799
00:37:02.340 --> 00:37:07.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the community with what happens next </v>

800
00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:09.070
<v Speaker 2>because I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a pretty amazing Anderson's a,</v>

801
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:10.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a Ninja.</v>

802
00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:11.760
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he really is.</v>

803
00:37:12.150 --> 00:37:17.150
<v Speaker 2>He's a real master martial artists in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>way that like what,</v>

804
00:37:17.340 --> 00:37:20.320
<v Speaker 2>what he does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's maybe a,</v>

805
00:37:20.321 --> 00:37:24.440
<v Speaker 2>a tiny handful of human beings on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>planet who can move the way he moves.</v>

806
00:37:24.570 --> 00:37:26.520
<v Speaker 2>And so I think going back to some of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

807
00:37:26.570 --> 00:37:29.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that relaxed state we were talking about</v>

808
00:37:29.431 --> 00:37:30.140
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

809
00:37:30.310 --> 00:37:32.970
<v Speaker 2>it's really watching him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watching him operate.</v>

810
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:35.500
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is like Jordan at his,</v>

811
00:37:35.570 --> 00:37:37.170
<v Speaker 2>at his top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>top of his game.</v>

812
00:37:37.171 --> 00:37:38.760
<v Speaker 2>That's just the panther,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

813
00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:41.600
<v Speaker 2>this art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this ballet movement.</v>

814
00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:42.250
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

815
00:37:42.370 --> 00:37:44.100
<v Speaker 2>just a fluid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

816
00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:45.870
<v Speaker 2>And a connected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

817
00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:47.660
<v Speaker 2>and I think a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of that's just,</v>

818
00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:50.520
<v Speaker 2>it seemed like a lot of that's missing </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the UFC these days right here.</v>

819
00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:53.040
<v Speaker 2>Any mixed martial arts forum that seems </v>
<v Speaker 2>to lead.</v>

820
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:54.590
<v Speaker 2>There's that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

821
00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:58.350
<v Speaker 2>there's the awesome gladiator go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what to do is bang it out,</v>

822
00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:02.490
<v Speaker 2>but there's that art that I just kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>missed from the earlier days of watching</v>

823
00:38:02.491 --> 00:38:04.980
<v Speaker 2>it be the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the bracket system where you had to</v>

824
00:38:04.981 --> 00:38:06.370
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

825
00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:09.540
<v Speaker 2>suck it up and get through three dudes </v>
<v Speaker 2>in one night.</v>

826
00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:11.580
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the old wrestling days.</v>

827
00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:12.930
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what Anderson is,</v>

828
00:38:12.931 --> 00:38:16.980
<v Speaker 2>is so much better than everyone else </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you get to see that art.</v>

829
00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:21.330
<v Speaker 2>Whereas like you see a couple of dudes </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are really close to each other,</v>

830
00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.810
<v Speaker 2>go at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't eat.</v>

831
00:38:23.970 --> 00:38:26.030
<v Speaker 2>They don't have that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

832
00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:31.090
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that giant skill level above their </v>

833
00:38:31.090 --> 00:38:32.610
<v Speaker 2>opponent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas Anderson does like when it comes</v>

834
00:38:32.611 --> 00:38:36.730
<v Speaker 2>to striking Anderson's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most accurate fighter we've ever had</v>

835
00:38:36.731 --> 00:38:41.731
<v Speaker 2>inside the octagon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like no one has been as accurate with </v>

836
00:38:41.731 --> 00:38:41.731
<v Speaker 2>him and he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's so,</v>

837
00:38:41.731 --> 00:38:43.840
<v Speaker 2>he's so fluid in the way he moves.</v>

838
00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:49.200
<v Speaker 2>He does things and its opponents don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>even realize he's done them until they </v>

839
00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:49.630
<v Speaker 2>land and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

840
00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:52.960
<v Speaker 2>He's like the master of like sneaking </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit in.</v>

841
00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:57.730
<v Speaker 2>It's a really unusual dude and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason why he's able to do that,</v>

842
00:38:57.731 --> 00:39:02.731
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mixed martial arts as a whole is really </v>

843
00:39:02.731 --> 00:39:05.290
<v Speaker 2>only been around since 1993 and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>seeing this constant evolution of it,</v>

844
00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:10.590
<v Speaker 2>but Anderson represents at right now </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's possible the furthest,</v>

845
00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:13.690
<v Speaker 2>furthest evolution of the game as far as</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's ever gone.</v>

846
00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:18.460
<v Speaker 2>But the reality is in his individual </v>
<v Speaker 2>disciplines,</v>

847
00:39:18.461 --> 00:39:22.220
<v Speaker 2>he's not as good as the best guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are better kickboxers therapy,</v>

848
00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:27.260
<v Speaker 2>better Jujitsu guys like him and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like one day we're going to see a guy </v>

849
00:39:27.551 --> 00:39:32.551
<v Speaker 2>who can do to Anderson Silva,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what Anderson Silva could do details on </v>

850
00:39:32.551 --> 00:39:32.551
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

851
00:39:32.551 --> 00:39:36.931
<v Speaker 2>we haven't seen it yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we're going to see a guy who has </v>

852
00:39:36.931 --> 00:39:38.590
<v Speaker 2>hixon Gracie Jujitsu and bought her rate</v>
<v Speaker 2>type striking.</v>

853
00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:39.340
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

854
00:39:39.341 --> 00:39:41.720
<v Speaker 2>and when that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the man and that's.</v>

855
00:39:41.870 --> 00:39:46.870
<v Speaker 2>It's inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the sport is moving in that </v>

856
00:39:46.870 --> 00:39:49.801
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like this constantly accelerating </v>

857
00:39:49.801 --> 00:39:52.321
<v Speaker 2>process and right now it's the only </v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are successful are the </v>

858
00:39:52.321 --> 00:39:54.880
<v Speaker 2>completely fanatical and obsessed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't get by and sheer athleticism.</v>

859
00:39:55.340 --> 00:40:00.340
<v Speaker 2>You see some basketball players that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they probably don't work out as hard as </v>

860
00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:00.500
<v Speaker 2>they could and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they maybe don't,</v>

861
00:40:00.501 --> 00:40:05.501
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're good enough to get by and </v>

862
00:40:05.501 --> 00:40:05.501
<v Speaker 2>they have enough gifts to get by in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>pro basketball player,</v>

863
00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:07.310
<v Speaker 2>tall and arrogant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you get to the,</v>

864
00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:12.600
<v Speaker 2>when you get to the top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the upper echelons of the ultimate </v>

865
00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:15.481
<v Speaker 2>fighting championship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no room for anybody but the </v>

866
00:40:15.481 --> 00:40:17.941
<v Speaker 2>fanatical.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no room for anybody but the </v>

867
00:40:17.941 --> 00:40:18.100
<v Speaker 2>obsessed and the Rory Mcdonald's of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

868
00:40:18.101 --> 00:40:20.980
<v Speaker 2>these young guys that are coming up that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are just insanely good.</v>

869
00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:25.980
<v Speaker 2>And every time you see them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're much better than they were six </v>

870
00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:25.980
<v Speaker 2>months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the future.</v>

871
00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:28.090
<v Speaker 2>And that's one that's inspiring because </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

872
00:40:28.091 --> 00:40:28.470
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

873
00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:33.510
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that chess game that we spoke of </v>

874
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:36.541
<v Speaker 2>earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it's more interesting to </v>

875
00:40:36.541 --> 00:40:38.701
<v Speaker 2>watch because although I don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>necessarily the frame of reference for </v>

876
00:40:38.701 --> 00:40:41.911
<v Speaker 2>what's actually happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you actually go back and look at </v>

877
00:40:41.911 --> 00:40:41.911
<v Speaker 2>the tape and go click by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>click and go,</v>

878
00:40:41.911 --> 00:40:46.590
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what you're talking </v>

879
00:40:46.590 --> 00:40:46.960
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>John and your corner just going this and</v>

880
00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:48.670
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

881
00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:52.810
<v Speaker 2>it's a chest moves and it's millimeters </v>
<v Speaker 2>and with a guy like Anderson,</v>

882
00:40:52.811 --> 00:40:55.900
<v Speaker 2>there's no one to tell him to do that </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he's that guy.</v>

883
00:40:56.530 --> 00:40:58.060
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anderson really doesn't have it.</v>

884
00:40:58.061 --> 00:41:03.061
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has guys that coach him and Moitai </v>

885
00:41:03.061 --> 00:41:05.340
<v Speaker 2>and coach them in Jujitsu when it comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>to mma and nobody always going to tell </v>

886
00:41:05.340 --> 00:41:07.210
<v Speaker 2>editors what to do and knows exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>what to do.</v>

887
00:41:07.210 --> 00:41:10.450
<v Speaker 2>He's at the top of the mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's beautiful to watch someone who's at</v>

888
00:41:10.451 --> 00:41:13.220
<v Speaker 2>the very best of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the like the,</v>

889
00:41:13.221 --> 00:41:16.330
<v Speaker 2>the peak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the apex of whatever that is right now.</v>

890
00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:21.680
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's fucking motorcycle racing </v>

891
00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:21.680
<v Speaker 2>or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gymnastics.</v>

892
00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:25.711
<v Speaker 2>When you see a guy who was at the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a quote from the movie vision </v>

893
00:41:25.711 --> 00:41:26.020
<v Speaker 2>quest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever see that movie?</v>

894

<v Speaker 2>That's a great.</v>

897
00:41:31.871 --> 00:41:34.330
<v Speaker 2>Because I forgot all about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't watched it lately though.</v>

898
00:41:34.331 --> 00:41:36.170
<v Speaker 2>In event held up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should watch it now.</v>

899
00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:37.700
<v Speaker 2>We should list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the girl's name?</v>

900
00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:40.250
<v Speaker 2>The girl with the black hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was hot as fuck.</v>

901
00:41:40.570 --> 00:41:45.570
<v Speaker 2>I'm member.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She moved into his house and he was </v>

902
00:41:45.570 --> 00:41:46.910
<v Speaker 2>caught smelling her panties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sylvester stallone.</v>

903

<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>

904
00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:54.640
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a scene in the movie where the </v>

905
00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:57.010
<v Speaker 2>guy is a google that now the kid is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>top and you know,</v>

906
00:41:57.390 --> 00:42:02.390
<v Speaker 2>he's like one of the top wrestlers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's about to face a state champion </v>

907
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:06.311
<v Speaker 2>wrestler and is huge thing and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>blown away by it and he's working as a </v>

908
00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:12.010
<v Speaker 2>delivery man at a hotel is working as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>room service guy and one of the cooks in</v>

909
00:42:12.351 --> 00:42:17.351
<v Speaker 2>the hotel and him have this conversation</v>
<v Speaker 2>about the guy seeing a Palae or I think </v>

910
00:42:18.741 --> 00:42:23.741
<v Speaker 2>it was Paleo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I've seen some incredible soccer </v>

911
00:42:23.741 --> 00:42:24.650
<v Speaker 2>game and seeing this guy do something </v>
<v Speaker 2>that just for that one moment you.</v>

912
00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:29.780
<v Speaker 2>You rejoiced in that guy's movements in </v>
<v Speaker 2>his ability to do something astounding.</v>

913
00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:34.960
<v Speaker 2>And for one moment I like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Raised the entire group of people that </v>

914
00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:39.161
<v Speaker 2>were watching it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For one moment we were above the apes </v>

915

981
00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:42.460
<v Speaker 2>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a sexual ride that Jennifer Aniston </v>

982
00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:44.460
<v Speaker 2>is completely incapable of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet she's way too self control,</v>

983
00:45:44.850 --> 00:45:49.130
<v Speaker 2>self conscious to controlled too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>too reserved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Angelina Jolie had billy Bob tattooed on</v>

985
00:45:53.661 --> 00:45:56.940
<v Speaker 2>her fucking arm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She fucked billy Bob Thornton,</v>

986
00:45:57.180 --> 00:46:02.180
<v Speaker 2>tattooed his name on her arm and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>carried his blood in a vial around her </v>

990
00:46:10.530 --> 00:46:12.110
<v Speaker 2>That was a great science.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just.</v>

991
00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:15.630
<v Speaker 2>And I think for some reason maybe I </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lindsay Lohan.</v>

992
00:46:15.690 --> 00:46:20.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what kind of bell rope she </v>

994
00:46:20.690 --> 00:46:21.660

<v Speaker 2>outweighs any of that.</v>

995
00:46:21.661 --> 00:46:26.661
<v Speaker 2>Just the drama that's attached to any of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff I think is just like not a </v>

996
00:46:26.661 --> 00:46:29.230
<v Speaker 2>part of my world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friend Tony always said it best.</v>

997
00:46:29.350 --> 00:46:34.350
<v Speaker 2>He said psychotic and erotic are next </v>
<v Speaker 2>door neighbors and they really.</v>

998
00:46:34.711 --> 00:46:36.900
<v Speaker 2>They're so close to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could see that.</v>

999
00:46:36.901 --> 00:46:41.570
<v Speaker 2>And the craziest girls I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the craziest girl I've ever dated was.</v>

1000
00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:44.910
<v Speaker 2>This is Lindsay Lohan,</v>

1001
00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:50.160
<v Speaker 4>some big ass tin cups,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cups.</v>

1002
00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:55.910
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to get in your ass Nigga.</v>

00:47:16.830 --> 00:47:20.570
<v Speaker 4>just remember the chorus which got some </v>
<v Speaker 4>big ass.</v>

1005
00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:25.600
<v Speaker 4>Today's it goes into it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to see them.</v>

1006
00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:33.980
<v Speaker 4>Do you see this is a different version </v>
<v Speaker 4>of man.</v>

1007
00:47:39.071 --> 00:47:43.750
<v Speaker 4>I'm telling you this</v>

1008
00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:47.820
<v Speaker 2>different version because the other one </v>
<v Speaker 2>was more sing silent.</v>

1009
00:47:47.910 --> 00:47:51.030
<v Speaker 2>Angelina's Xiao Li gas on a big ass </v>
<v Speaker 2>titties.</v>

1010
00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:56.260
<v Speaker 2>It was like more rhythmic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think these guys bit them big problem </v>

1011
00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:58.560
<v Speaker 2>in the rap community from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the comedy community,</v>

1012
00:47:58.830 --> 00:48:00.810
<v Speaker 2>which brings me back to bill Hicks at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1013
00:48:00.811 --> 00:48:01.680
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1014
00:48:01.681 --> 00:48:06.681
<v Speaker 2>I was a big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge fan of Denis leary for about six </v>

1015
00:48:06.681 --> 00:48:06.870
<v Speaker 2>months until I saw Hicks and then I </v>
<v Speaker 2>went,</v>

1016
00:48:06.871 --> 00:48:08.820
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You guys doing the same jokes?</v>

00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:09.950
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

1019
00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:12.230
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and no disrespect to bill,</v>

1020
00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:16.520

<v Speaker 1>that was his world.</v>

1023
00:48:20.481 --> 00:48:22.110
<v Speaker 1>He was staying in that world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

1024
00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:24.140
<v Speaker 1>this is his whole purpose is to do this </v>

00:48:43.061 --> 00:48:43.061
<v Speaker 1>like watching everybody tried to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1033
00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:44.460
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>

1034
00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:49.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>binkies trying to get that position and </v>

1035
00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:51.780
<v Speaker 1>our shakes and all that and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I feel like Larry was,</v>

1036
00:48:53.810 --> 00:48:58.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to lay on him as far </v>

1037
00:48:58.810 --> 00:48:58.810
<v Speaker 1>as like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1038
00:48:58.810 --> 00:49:01.310
<v Speaker 1>biting that style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter because as it went on,</v>

1039
00:49:01.311 --> 00:49:04.160
<v Speaker 1>what he ended up doing with all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he ended up becoming.</v>

1040
00:49:04.161 --> 00:49:06.710
<v Speaker 1>He making his own thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even though it kind of,</v>

1041
00:49:06.711 --> 00:49:11.711
<v Speaker 1>maybe you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it clearly just clearly carbon copied </v>

1042
00:49:11.711 --> 00:49:13.970
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in his defense I feel like,</v>

1043
00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:17.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back then it was war,</v>

1044
00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:22.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're trying to make your make your </v>

1045
00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:22.140
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

1046
00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:22.140
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't give that.</v>

1047
00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:22.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't give him that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was really,</v>

1048
00:49:22.750 --> 00:49:24.880
<v Speaker 2>he could have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could have come up with his own shit.</v>

1049
00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:25.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I think,</v>

1050
00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:30.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had the same problem with them for </v>

1051
00:49:30.690 --> 00:49:30.690
<v Speaker 1>many years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

1052
00:49:30.690 --> 00:49:30.940

1081
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:44.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like overnight and I was in.</v>

1082
00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:49.930
<v Speaker 1>I was in a hotel in Detroit or flying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe the next morning and uh,</v>

1083
00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:56.260
<v Speaker 1>I woke up in the middle of the night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like just bolt upright at whatever time </v>

1084
00:50:57.351 --> 00:50:58.870
<v Speaker 1>that was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can remember at the time was.</v>

1085
00:50:58.871 --> 00:51:03.871
<v Speaker 1>But like I basically was awake and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>we got up the next morning and my pager </v>

1086
00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:09.160
<v Speaker 1>beeper got a message from Dunkin is </v>
<v Speaker 1>manager and it was like bill pass last </v>

1087
00:51:09.710 --> 00:51:14.710
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the time that was quoted he passed </v>

1088
00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:16.190
<v Speaker 1>was when I woke up in bed and was pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>creepy.</v>

1089
00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:21.790
<v Speaker 2>Your stomach actually via wherever he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

1090
00:51:21.791 --> 00:51:23.710
<v Speaker 2>through Detroit to tap me on his way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1091
00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:25.540
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry to make you go to Detroit.</v>

1092
00:51:27.220 --> 00:51:30.490
<v Speaker 2>It's probably a really quick trip when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in hyperspace.</v>

1093
00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:36.040
<v Speaker 2>It's probably right next door.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He reached over and press found out </v>

1094
00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:36.040
<v Speaker 2>about his.</v>

1095
00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:39.110
<v Speaker 1>I found out about his problem because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>had an awful nightmare when we were.</v>

1096
00:51:39.150 --> 00:51:44.150
<v Speaker 1>I was at a one of those kinds of motels </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you get the you can pull your car </v>

1097
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:47.791
<v Speaker 1>right up to the outside and it was kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of like the two stories and you kind of </v>

1098
00:51:47.791 --> 00:51:47.791
<v Speaker 1>walk through the breezeway between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

1099
00:51:47.791 --> 00:51:51.460
<v Speaker 1>He's and there was like a hundred people</v>
<v Speaker 1>there and everybody's bawling their eyes</v>

1100
00:51:51.461 --> 00:51:54.880
<v Speaker 1>out and bill wasn't there and I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this dream about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I called the.</v>

1102
00:51:57.430 --> 00:52:00.190
<v Speaker 1>I called his manager the next day and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1103
00:52:00.490 --> 00:52:04.030
<v Speaker 1>I had this fucked up dream about bill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

1104
00:52:04.930 --> 00:52:06.580

1105
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:12.910
<v Speaker 1>And nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because nobody knew yet that he had </v>

1106
00:52:12.910 --> 00:52:14.581
<v Speaker 1>pancreatic cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had this fucked up dream and I called </v>

1111
00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:25.760
<v Speaker 2>do you believe mean there's no way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was coincidental?</v>

1112
00:52:25.850 --> 00:52:26.870
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No Way.</v>

1113
00:52:26.900 --> 00:52:27.770
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no way.</v>

1114
00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:29.840

<v Speaker 2>What's going on there?</v>

1115
00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:30.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there a zero,</v>

1116
00:52:30.890 --> 00:52:35.890
<v Speaker 2>zero,</v>
<v Speaker 2>zero dimension that is next door </v>

1117
00:52:35.890 --> 00:52:36.830
<v Speaker 2>neighbor that you can tap into that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>have no idea.</v>

1118
00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:41.840
<v Speaker 2>Edix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Diarrhetics what the fuck is that?</v>

1119
00:52:42.861 --> 00:52:43.310
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

1120
00:52:43.311 --> 00:52:44.270
<v Speaker 2>but it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty</v>

1121
00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:47.230
<v Speaker 1>and I had a couple moments like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>with him over that time.</v>

1122
00:52:47.231 --> 00:52:48.220
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when he died,</v>

1123
00:52:48.221 --> 00:52:49.120
<v Speaker 1>like I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1124
00:52:49.330 --> 00:52:50.620
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course they woke up in the middle.</v>

1125
00:52:50.730 --> 00:52:55.730
<v Speaker 2>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never had anything like that </v>

1126
00:52:55.730 --> 00:52:55.730
<v Speaker 2>happened to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I absolutely believe it's possible.</v>

1127
00:52:55.730 --> 00:52:55.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1128
00:52:56.110 --> 00:52:57.610
<v Speaker 1>it was a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a weird time.</v>

1129
00:52:57.990 --> 00:53:02.990
<v Speaker 2>They see the most provable form of any </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of psychic phenomenon is the </v>

1130
00:53:02.990 --> 00:53:03.420
<v Speaker 2>ability to know when someone's looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>at you,</v>

1131
00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:05.550
<v Speaker 2>they said that statistically you can </v>
<v Speaker 2>prove,</v>

1132
00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:09.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have people stand and have their</v>

1133
00:53:09.181 --> 00:53:13.950
<v Speaker 2>back facing a group of people and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can statistically tell with,</v>

1134
00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:15.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain amount of uncertainty,</v>

1135
00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:20.600
<v Speaker 2>guesswork,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could show on a graph that </v>

1136
00:53:20.600 --> 00:53:20.600
<v Speaker 2>people can tell when people are looking </v>
<v Speaker 2>at them,</v>

1137
00:53:21.600 --> 00:53:23.460
<v Speaker 2>if that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that is possible,</v>

1138
00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:26.010
<v Speaker 2>valid than these other things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely on some</v>

1139
00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:28.320
<v Speaker 1>level valid because it's energy.</v>

1140
00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:31.600
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever heard of the work of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rupert Sheldrake?</v>

1141
00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:35.390
<v Speaker 2>He's this guy who believes in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>morphogenetic field and he's,</v>

1142
00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:39.370
<v Speaker 2>he's done research showing that dogs can</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell when their owners are coming home.</v>

1143
00:53:39.730 --> 00:53:44.730
<v Speaker 2>He believes there is some sort of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>frequency that we're all tuning into </v>

1144
00:53:44.730 --> 00:53:48.781
<v Speaker 2>that all of our consciousness connected </v>
<v Speaker 2>to some type of grid and you can </v>

1145
00:53:48.781 --> 00:53:52.240
<v Speaker 2>recognize when that's in motion and you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can recognize things and events,</v>

1146
00:53:52.270 --> 00:53:55.420
<v Speaker 2>things that are happening and it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a matter of us being sensitive</v>

1147
00:53:55.421 --> 00:53:57.370
<v Speaker 2>enough to tune it in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1148
00:53:57.371 --> 00:53:58.100
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1149
00:53:59.230 --> 00:54:04.230
<v Speaker 2>I think that's really one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>weirdest things about being a human </v>

1150
00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:04.540
<v Speaker 2>being.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1151
00:54:04.710 --> 00:54:05.920
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1152
00:54:05.921 --> 00:54:06.970
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not doing that.</v>

1153
00:54:07.120 --> 00:54:09.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't think he is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might be.</v>

1154
00:54:09.131 --> 00:54:10.960
<v Speaker 2>I doubt if he does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll be okay.</v>

1155
00:54:11.140 --> 00:54:12.730
<v Speaker 2>He's just a mess.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's from Ohio,</v>

1156
00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:15.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I rescued him from Columbus.</v>

1157
00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:18.190
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1158
00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:23.640
<v Speaker 2>I want to believe that we're slowly but </v>
<v Speaker 2>surely moving from the phase of grunts </v>

1159
00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:27.850
<v Speaker 2>to language to written language to </v>
<v Speaker 2>internet,</v>

1160
00:54:27.851 --> 00:54:30.580
<v Speaker 2>to psychic ability to communication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1161
00:54:30.790 --> 00:54:34.060
<v Speaker 2>I want to think that it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's so much room for fuckery.</v>

1162
00:54:34.061 --> 00:54:36.410
<v Speaker 2>There's so much room for fake psychics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1163
00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:38.250
<v Speaker 2>So when I hear a story like yours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1164
00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:39.580
<v Speaker 2>ah Ha,</v>

1165
00:54:41.810 --> 00:54:46.810
<v Speaker 1>I have no reason to lie about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like it's going to make or </v>

1166
00:54:46.810 --> 00:54:46.810
<v Speaker 1>break my career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1167
00:54:46.810 --> 00:54:48.780
<v Speaker 1>So what does sound cool?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds pretty cool.</v>

1168
00:54:48.810 --> 00:54:51.540
<v Speaker 1>Pretty bitchy to bring up at a party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're in front of a fire.</v>

1169
00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:52.110
<v Speaker 1>Touch me.</v>

1170
00:54:54.330 --> 00:54:59.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody wants to fucking claim </v>

1171
00:54:59.330 --> 00:54:59.330
<v Speaker 2>psychic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody wants to claim it.</v>

1172
00:54:59.330 --> 00:54:59.830
<v Speaker 2>It's so hard.</v>

1173
00:54:59.890 --> 00:55:01.420
<v Speaker 1>Trust people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't take no shit.</v>

1174
00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:02.280
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

1175
00:55:02.290 --> 00:55:07.290
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem with all of that is that </v>

1176
00:55:07.290 --> 00:55:07.290
<v Speaker 1>we're not probably on some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1177
00:55:07.290 --> 00:55:11.540
<v Speaker 1>a universal level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not really allowed to completely </v>

1178
00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:14.551
<v Speaker 1>be able to tap in and rely on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although I do firmly believed that each </v>

1179
00:55:14.551 --> 00:55:16.930
<v Speaker 1>one of us has to kind of really </v>
<v Speaker 1>listening to the,</v>

1180
00:55:16.931 --> 00:55:21.931
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the intuitive side of ourselves to kind </v>

1181
00:55:21.931 --> 00:55:24.901
<v Speaker 1>of just follow your heart and know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>path you're supposed to choose because </v>

1182
00:55:24.901 --> 00:55:27.580
<v Speaker 1>we all kind of have a role to play at </v>
<v Speaker 1>second and you kind of have to find that</v>

1183
00:55:27.581 --> 00:55:32.581
<v Speaker 1>happy medium between like making </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself happy and making sure you're </v>

1184
00:55:32.581 --> 00:55:33.400
<v Speaker 1>fulfill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also kind of doing,</v>

1185
00:55:34.030 --> 00:55:35.170
<v Speaker 1>doing your part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1186
00:55:35.330 --> 00:55:35.910
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they work.</v>

1187
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:40.990
<v Speaker 2>The intuitive is such an interesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>point because your intuition depends on </v>

1188
00:55:43.431 --> 00:55:46.310
<v Speaker 2>your respect for your consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Respend.</v>

1189
00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:51.470
<v Speaker 2>It depends on your respect for your </v>
<v Speaker 2>honesty about your own actions and your </v>

1190
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:55.061
<v Speaker 2>own thoughts and your own ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I find that when I am the most at </v>

1191
00:55:55.061 --> 00:55:58.130
<v Speaker 2>peace with my own actions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then I am a much,</v>

1192
00:55:58.131 --> 00:56:00.860
<v Speaker 2>a much better in tune with other people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I've,</v>

1193
00:56:00.861 --> 00:56:02.880
<v Speaker 2>I've met people that were completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>full of shit.</v>

1194
00:56:02.881 --> 00:56:07.881
<v Speaker 2>And like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how does this guy not know that he's </v>

1195
00:56:07.881 --> 00:56:10.241
<v Speaker 2>full of Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not know that no one's going to buy </v>

1196
00:56:10.241 --> 00:56:10.241
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you how,</v>

1197
00:56:10.241 --> 00:56:10.900
<v Speaker 2>because he's lying to himself because </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's lying.</v>

1198
00:56:10.910 --> 00:56:11.390
<v Speaker 2>He's lying</v>

1199
00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:17.520
<v Speaker 1>in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Positive reinforcement for his negative </v>

1200
00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:17.520
<v Speaker 1>actions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he keeps winning,</v>

1201
00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:18.400
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if it's negative,</v>

1202
00:56:19.210 --> 00:56:21.640
<v Speaker 1>that's just going to reinforce that and </v>
<v Speaker 1>reinforce that big</v>

1203
00:56:21.930 --> 00:56:26.930
<v Speaker 2>when I'm most honest myself is when I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>get the most intuitive reads off of </v>

1204
00:56:27.101 --> 00:56:28.750
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had one friend,</v>

<v Speaker 2>involved with friends that would turn </v>

1207
00:56:37.661 --> 00:56:41.830
<v Speaker 2>out to be crazy and idiots and thieves </v>
<v Speaker 2>and nuts and worst,</v>

1208
00:56:42.160 --> 00:56:43.210
<v Speaker 2>the worst,</v>

1231
00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:47.620
<v Speaker 3>younger when I was like [inaudible] 93,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to Lollapalooza and I was really </v>

1232
00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:50.240
<v Speaker 3>a hippie kind of back there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then in a tool was one of the.</v>

1233
00:57:51.010 --> 00:57:53.030
<v Speaker 3>Because I used to be at nine snail fan </v>

1240
00:58:14.030 --> 00:58:14.030
<v Speaker 3>amazing when you're on mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I watched a documentary about it once </v>
<v Speaker 2>where they showed pine cones and </v>

1261
00:59:01.761 --> 00:59:05.720
<v Speaker 2>pineapples and sunflowers and all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>different things show that there's some </v>

1262
00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:10.401
<v Speaker 2>sort,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a mathematical code to </v>

1263
00:59:10.401 --> 00:59:10.401
<v Speaker 2>nature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1264
00:59:10.401 --> 00:59:14.180
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think the funny thing is like </v>

1265
00:59:14.180 --> 00:59:14.180
<v Speaker 2>people</v>

1266
00:59:14.180 --> 00:59:15.130
<v Speaker 3>myself actually trying to like force </v>
<v Speaker 3>those numbers on a song.</v>

1267
00:59:15.131 --> 00:59:16.450
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's kind of funny.</v>

1268
00:59:16.451 --> 00:59:20.710
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of clunky because the song is </v>
<v Speaker 3>that any song is that,</v>

1269
00:59:20.711 --> 00:59:21.800
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1270
00:59:21.801 --> 00:59:22.040
<v Speaker 3>to Kinda</v>

1271
00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:24.610
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

1272
00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:25.850
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1273
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:28.300
<v Speaker 2>my kid blocks like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

1274
00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:29.840
<v Speaker 2>look through square.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they stack,</v>

1275
00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:31.370
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

1276
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:33.170
<v Speaker 2>every,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything is that.</v>

1277
00:59:33.171 --> 00:59:35.860
<v Speaker 2>So it like actually like write your </v>
<v Speaker 2>faces,</v>

1278
00:59:36.230 --> 00:59:39.920
<v Speaker 2>force that into a song is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a little a sophomore.</v>

1279
00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:45.190
<v Speaker 2>So I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm reprimanding myself for being a </v>

1280
00:59:45.190 --> 00:59:45.190
<v Speaker 2>little silly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1281
00:59:45.190 --> 00:59:45.190
<v Speaker 2>you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will.</v>

1282
00:59:45.190 --> 00:59:47.870
<v Speaker 2>I thought it was an homage to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1283
00:59:47.871 --> 00:59:49.220
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the order of the universe.</v>

1284
00:59:49.221 --> 00:59:51.500
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think there was silly at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's as a fan.</v>

1285
00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:53.400
<v Speaker 2>I enjoyed it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>

1286
00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:55.250
<v Speaker 2>it was just short for fanatic and I have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go now.</v>

1287
00:59:55.940 --> 01:00:00.940
<v Speaker 2>That's why you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at someone with a nose job and </v>

1288
01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:00.940
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is going on here?</v>

1289
01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:03.380
<v Speaker 2>Some of these ruined the sequence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've ruined the FIBONACCI sequence.</v>

1290
01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:06.680
<v Speaker 2>Now you gotta make you gotTa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Make Lemons into lemonade.</v>

1291
01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:09.110
<v Speaker 2>You gotTa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotta make soup out of the Ham hocks</v>

1292
01:00:09.111 --> 01:00:10.250
<v Speaker 2>and the beans that you've been given.</v>

1293
01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:13.160
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just is what it is.</v>

1294
01:00:13.410 --> 01:00:14.720
<v Speaker 2>When,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1295
01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:20.190
<v Speaker 2>when you really find out that there </v>
<v Speaker 2>truly is a mathematical sequence that </v>

1296
01:00:20.991 --> 01:00:25.991
<v Speaker 2>the whole universe is based on it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of those things that really </v>

1297
01:00:25.991 --> 01:00:27.590
<v Speaker 2>makes you step back and go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are,</v>

1298
01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:32.920
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we might as well be fucking cave men </v>

1299
01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:32.960
<v Speaker 2>because even though we like to think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that with our four g connections and our</v>

1300
01:00:32.961 --> 01:00:37.961
<v Speaker 2>satellite dishes in our cars that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow or another have elevated from </v>

1301
01:00:37.961 --> 01:00:39.020
<v Speaker 2>the biological.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Bob was,</v>

1302
01:00:39.021 --> 01:00:44.021
<v Speaker 2>so it was still so base.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're still so stuck in the Rut of the </v>

1303
01:00:44.021 --> 01:00:45.290
<v Speaker 2>mud and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1304
01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:46.710
<v Speaker 2>we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We really,</v>

1305
01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:51.720
<v Speaker 2>really have barely wrapped our heads </v>
<v Speaker 2>around how complicated and insane and </v>

1306
01:00:51.861 --> 01:00:55.490
<v Speaker 2>diverse this whole thing really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The FIBONACCI sequence.</v>

1307
01:00:55.491 --> 01:00:57.190
<v Speaker 2>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like one of those real,</v>

1308
01:00:57.230 --> 01:01:02.230
<v Speaker 2>real mindfox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes you just pause and there was a </v>

1309
01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:06.460
<v Speaker 2>particle physicist recently or </v>
<v Speaker 2>theoretical physicist that was talking </v>

1310
01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:09.701
<v Speaker 2>about when they study quantum mechanics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they find that there's some sort of an </v>

1311
01:01:10.431 --> 01:01:12.470
<v Speaker 2>embedded code to it all.</v>

1312
01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:16.970
<v Speaker 2>That it's not just an embedded code.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a recognizable code that is used in</v>

1313
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.500
<v Speaker 2>mathematicians and they said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1314
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:22.160
<v Speaker 2>fucking the whole universe is a program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets a program,</v>

1315
01:01:22.310 --> 01:01:23.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether you call it,</v>

1316
01:01:23.690 --> 01:01:28.690
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a biological program or </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether there's intelligent design has </v>

1317
01:01:28.690 --> 01:01:31.070
<v Speaker 2>been done by some engineer from pro </v>
<v Speaker 2>beefiest movie,</v>

1318
01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:33.320
<v Speaker 2>whatever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a program to this.</v>

1319
01:01:34.930 --> 01:01:39.930
<v Speaker 2>I was always playing around with just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>story where you actually day on the way </v>

1320
01:01:39.930 --> 01:01:44.531
<v Speaker 2>to time travel would be to somehow </v>
<v Speaker 2>connect into the base of your DNA and </v>

1321
01:01:44.531 --> 01:01:48.301
<v Speaker 2>there's actually a time code in the DNA </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you have to like reset it so that </v>

1322
01:01:48.301 --> 01:01:51.350
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden you just end up in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>other time zone,</v>

1323
01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:53.810
<v Speaker 2>but then you would.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your software wouldn't be compatible,</v>

1324
01:01:53.811 --> 01:01:55.970
<v Speaker 2>so this whole script fell apart just </v>
<v Speaker 2>before my eyes.</v>

1325
01:01:57.980 --> 01:02:02.980
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if you did decide you were going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to go into another dimension and you go </v>

1326
01:02:02.980 --> 01:02:06.551
<v Speaker 2>into the the other dementia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would just be engulfed in complete </v>

1327
01:02:06.551 --> 01:02:08.780
<v Speaker 2>madness because you don't have the tools</v>
<v Speaker 2>to deal with that new.</v>

1328
01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:11.570
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like that.</v>

1329
01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:16.680
<v Speaker 2>Like you go to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to hit enter and you're </v>

1330
01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:16.680
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1331
01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:19.331
<v Speaker 2>I forgot a zero.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just fucking kaleidoscope</v>

1332
01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:25.400
<v Speaker 3>until the end of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like that movie or the twilight </v>

1333
01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:27.270
<v Speaker 3>zone episode.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When was at Burgess,</v>

1334
01:02:27.271 --> 01:02:32.271
<v Speaker 3>meredith was all just all he wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do was read and just leave me alone </v>

1335
01:02:32.271 --> 01:02:36.621
<v Speaker 3>leave and he's in inside of a library </v>
<v Speaker 3>and a nuclear explosion happens and </v>

1336
01:02:36.621 --> 01:02:40.821
<v Speaker 3>everyone's dead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's surrounded by all these books </v>

1337
01:02:40.821 --> 01:02:40.821
<v Speaker 3>and then he breaks his glasses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

1338
01:02:40.821 --> 01:02:42.540
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck it.</v>

1339
01:02:42.541 --> 01:02:47.541
<v Speaker 3>Just forever in this downward spiral of </v>
<v Speaker 3>inability to perceive his environment.</v>

1340
01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:52.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm worried about him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's all right.</v>

1341
01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:55.470
<v Speaker 3>I was worried about him for the first </v>
<v Speaker 3>five years.</v>

1342
01:02:55.471 --> 01:02:57.270
<v Speaker 3>I knew it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When we got into,</v>

1343
01:02:58.860 --> 01:03:03.860
<v Speaker 3>we got into a groove and I know he knows</v>
<v Speaker 3>exactly what he's doing.</v>

1344
01:03:04.640 --> 01:03:06.300
<v Speaker 3>That's the only way to kill the hanging </v>
<v Speaker 3>over.</v>

1345
01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:08.640
<v Speaker 3>You just start.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When he starts slurring,</v>

1346
01:03:08.641 --> 01:03:10.160
<v Speaker 3>you're going to get nervous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's.</v>

1347
01:03:10.570 --> 01:03:12.500
<v Speaker 3>He's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1348
01:03:12.730 --> 01:03:13.950
<v Speaker 3>He's always looking at you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1349
01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:16.830
<v Speaker 3>He's got monitors too,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so even when he's not looking at you,</v>

1350
01:03:16.831 --> 01:03:21.831
<v Speaker 3>he's looking at you through monitors and</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you really need to think about is </v>

1351
01:03:21.831 --> 01:03:24.090
<v Speaker 3>the fact that out over a sold out show </v>
<v Speaker 3>tonight at the thing.</v>

1352
01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:24.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Ice House.</v>

1353
01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:26.400
<v Speaker 3>The ice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'll be up there.</v>

1354
01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:29.110
<v Speaker 3>He's a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's got some funny jokes.</v>

1355
01:03:30.930 --> 01:03:33.120
<v Speaker 3>You should come tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm working.</v>

1356
01:03:35.940 --> 01:03:38.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you should let people invite themselves.</v>

1357
01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:43.840
<v Speaker 3>That way you don't get rejected now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm actually pouring wine tonight at </v>

1358
01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:44.760
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh you.</v>

1359
01:03:44.761 --> 01:03:46.380
<v Speaker 3>If people want to go see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where is it at?</v>

1360
01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:48.330
<v Speaker 3>It's a every Royce.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an old,</v>

1361
01:03:48.690 --> 01:03:53.690
<v Speaker 3>old Pasadena down the street here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard crazy stories about you with </v>

1362
01:03:53.690 --> 01:03:56.010
<v Speaker 3>these at signings A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard shows.</v>

1363
01:03:56.011 --> 01:04:01.011
<v Speaker 3>There's shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shows that you've done when you tone </v>

1364
01:04:01.011 --> 01:04:01.110
<v Speaker 3>your entire back to the audience during </v>
<v Speaker 3>the entire performance.</v>

1365
01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:06.440
<v Speaker 3>Have you done that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have really an awful sensitivity to a </v>

1366
01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:08.190
<v Speaker 3>flash.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A flash.</v>

1367
01:04:08.191 --> 01:04:10.230
<v Speaker 3>Cameras flashing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if I,</v>

1368
01:04:10.231 --> 01:04:11.550
<v Speaker 3>if the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you just can't,</v>

1369
01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:13.830
<v Speaker 3>people can't control themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just have to.</v>

1370
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:18.910
<v Speaker 3>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't focus on what I'm doing because </v>

1371
01:04:18.910 --> 01:04:21.801
<v Speaker 3>I'll actually go into a convulsion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I have really had to take an </v>

1372
01:04:21.801 --> 01:04:23.040
<v Speaker 3>epileptic convulsion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't finish the set.</v>

1373
01:04:23.070 --> 01:04:25.290
<v Speaker 3>So I'm sorry I have to turn my fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>back to you.</v>

<v Speaker 3>so you sensed that he was friendly.</v>

1405
01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:49.000
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>So beautiful.</v>

1409
01:05:56.081 --> 01:06:01.081
<v Speaker 3>You give them links to the arm around </v>
<v Speaker 3>and when you thought you were like the </v>

1413
01:06:07.841 --> 01:06:09.700
<v Speaker 3>to fight that art look.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He throws his arms up.</v>

1414
01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:12.430
<v Speaker 3>He was just thinking Dick against his,</v>

<v Speaker 3>It shows me everything that happened.</v>

1425
01:06:39.551 --> 01:06:41.680
<v Speaker 3>We actually had a guest singer come out </v>
<v Speaker 3>on that song,</v>

1426

<v Speaker 3>singer doing a thing to show you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just held them back control.</v>

1489
01:09:45.780 --> 01:09:47.720
<v Speaker 3>it's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would never notice the difference,</v>

1490
01:09:48.020 --> 01:09:53.020
<v Speaker 3>especially when you're listening to it </v>
<v Speaker 3>on this fucking thing like that </v>

1491
01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:55.580
<v Speaker 3>Portlandia episode like let's have on </v>
<v Speaker 3>these little speakers.</v>

1492
01:09:55.940 --> 01:10:00.940
<v Speaker 3>Do you have one of those artists that </v>
<v Speaker 3>emerged through the digital takeover of,</v>

1493
01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.490
<v Speaker 3>of music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was that like for you to watch that</v>

1494
01:10:04.491 --> 01:10:07.250
<v Speaker 3>happen where all of a sudden your shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>was online and you know,</v>

1495
01:10:07.251 --> 01:10:08.300
<v Speaker 3>to go through the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1496
01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:11.340
<v Speaker 3>the whole,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the whole scene with a.</v>

1497
01:10:12.130 --> 01:10:14.810
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean some people just kind of tried to</v>

1498
01:10:14.811 --> 01:10:16.650
<v Speaker 3>fight it and there's other people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>did know,</v>

1499
01:10:16.780 --> 01:10:19.730
<v Speaker 3>had to do whatever they had to do to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to kind of embrace it.</v>

1500
01:10:20.130 --> 01:10:25.010
<v Speaker 3>I know there's one thing I know for sure</v>
<v Speaker 3>you cannot download my wine.</v>

1501
01:10:26.850 --> 01:10:29.390
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not a digital format.</v>

1502
01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:34.420
<v Speaker 3>Not yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not until we have those printers that </v>

1503
01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:36.731
<v Speaker 3>can print out your wine show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crazy as that sounds retarded.</v>

1504
01:10:37.850 --> 01:10:42.850
<v Speaker 3>Just five years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That sounds more walking around with a </v>

1505
01:10:42.850 --> 01:10:43.790
<v Speaker 3>phone that's not connected to anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's funny.</v>

1506
01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:49.720
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jay Leno has one of these three d </v>

1507
01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:52.451
<v Speaker 3>printers in his shop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He puts a video online of him making </v>

1508
01:10:52.451 --> 01:10:52.850
<v Speaker 3>parts for old cars with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1509
01:10:53.390 --> 01:10:54.950
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1510
01:10:54.951 --> 01:10:57.620
<v Speaker 3>you just run it through a scanner and </v>
<v Speaker 3>next thing you know it's.</v>

1511
01:10:57.950 --> 01:10:59.650
<v Speaker 3>There it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1512
01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:02.430
<v Speaker 3>And that's the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm loving this wine now.</v>

1513
01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:05.900
<v Speaker 3>I actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually see that's the problem.</v>

1514
01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:12.460
<v Speaker 3>His problem is it's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like at all the problems in the </v>

1515
01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:12.460
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>

1516
01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:14.310
<v Speaker 3>When was the last time you were at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Olive Garden?</v>

1517
01:11:14.900 --> 01:11:17.580
<v Speaker 1>A lot longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You motherfucker,</v>

1518
01:11:17.581 --> 01:11:20.250
<v Speaker 1>you did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have to go there for me to be my</v>

1519
01:11:20.251 --> 01:11:21.300
<v Speaker 1>first time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1520
01:11:21.301 --> 01:11:23.400
<v Speaker 1>you have never been.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not snooty.</v>

1521
01:11:25.100 --> 01:11:27.390
<v Speaker 1>Is it hard to find good restaurants in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arizona?</v>

1522
01:11:27.670 --> 01:11:28.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1523
01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:29.700
<v Speaker 1>Where we are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

1524
01:11:29.701 --> 01:11:34.701
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a handful of pretty awesome </v>

1525
01:11:34.701 --> 01:11:36.381
<v Speaker 1>places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's not as many as we would </v>

1526
01:11:36.381 --> 01:11:36.381
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1527
01:11:36.381 --> 01:11:40.040
<v Speaker 1>how far are you away from Phoenix?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two hours to Tucson worth four hours </v>

1528
01:11:41.131 --> 01:11:46.131
<v Speaker 1>from Tucson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the other area of note is </v>

1529
01:11:46.131 --> 01:11:46.560
<v Speaker 1>Sedona,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1530
01:11:46.561 --> 01:11:51.561
<v Speaker 1>That's where the donor has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even Sedona has only a couple places </v>

1531
01:11:51.561 --> 01:11:53.100
<v Speaker 1>that are really good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you'll take that just for the small.</v>

1532
01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:54.620
<v Speaker 1>I just cook myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1533
01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:59.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just do my own Ravioli's and we know </v>

1534
01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:00.240
<v Speaker 1>we have our own gardens and orchards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1535
01:12:00.241 --> 01:12:01.710
<v Speaker 1>that is a cool thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a cook.</v>

1536
01:12:01.770 --> 01:12:04.290
<v Speaker 1>I just started doing that this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grow my own vegetables.</v>

1537
01:12:04.290 --> 01:12:06.350
<v Speaker 1>We'll have like a salad made out of her </v>
<v Speaker 1>own vegetables.</v>

1538
01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:11.360
<v Speaker 1>There's something cool about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something hunter gatherer that </v>

1539
01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:12.180
<v Speaker 1>just so and it's anybody and even in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>big city like this,</v>

1540
01:12:12.181 --> 01:12:15.630
<v Speaker 1>if you have one of those apartments that</v>
<v Speaker 1>has like a little bit of dirt near you,</v>

1541
01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:19.240
<v Speaker 1>you can make your own food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any any square,</v>

1542
01:12:19.290 --> 01:12:23.280
<v Speaker 1>five square feet of dirt near you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in this community.</v>

1543
01:12:23.281 --> 01:12:27.240
<v Speaker 1>You can grow enough stuff that you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>get with your neighbors and the trade.</v>

1544
01:12:27.270 --> 01:12:32.270
<v Speaker 1>That's my ultimate goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do the garlic and I'll do the potatoes </v>

1545
01:12:32.270 --> 01:12:32.580
<v Speaker 1>and tomatoes and then you're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>trading.</v>

1546
01:12:32.581 --> 01:12:35.660
<v Speaker 1>You're happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I see a cue,</v>

1547
01:12:35.690 --> 01:12:37.890
<v Speaker 1>like do something crazy like start a </v>
<v Speaker 1>vineyard,</v>

1548
01:12:38.030 --> 01:12:43.030
<v Speaker 1>you know that that to me is far more </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated than what I ever wanted to </v>

1549
01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:43.330
<v Speaker 1>accomplish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I want to accomplish,</v>

1550
01:12:43.390 --> 01:12:47.750
<v Speaker 1>find a way to live sustainably of one </v>
<v Speaker 1>piece of land.</v>

1551
01:12:48.270 --> 01:12:52.240
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's a farm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a small family farm or what,</v>

1552
01:12:52.290 --> 01:12:53.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>livestock,</v>

1553
01:12:53.551 --> 01:12:57.360
<v Speaker 1>just as romantic as it sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not necessarily that feasible.</v>

1554
01:12:57.390 --> 01:12:57.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

1555
01:12:57.870 --> 01:13:00.030
<v Speaker 1>there was a lot of draw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of things that just,</v>

1556
01:13:00.150 --> 01:13:02.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nature will nature will school you,</v>

1557
01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:07.940
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it ends up really coming down to a </v>

1558
01:13:07.940 --> 01:13:09.200
<v Speaker 1>collaboration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really does come down to,</v>

1559
01:13:09.350 --> 01:13:12.060
<v Speaker 1>to not just hunter gatherer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cultivator,</v>

1560
01:13:12.061 --> 01:13:17.061
<v Speaker 1>but also community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to kind of work together to </v>

1561
01:13:17.061 --> 01:13:17.061
<v Speaker 1>make any of that work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>

1562
01:13:17.061 --> 01:13:21.441
<v Speaker 1>that's the reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people that have that </v>

1563
01:13:21.441 --> 01:13:23.510
<v Speaker 1>romantic notion of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just going to go out to the woods </v>

1564
01:13:23.510 --> 01:13:25.551
<v Speaker 1>and just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just live off the land and you're </v>

1565
01:13:25.551 --> 01:13:25.890
<v Speaker 1>going to live a very short life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where a cult comes in.</v>

1566
01:13:25.950 --> 01:13:28.650
<v Speaker 1>That's where the coal comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So by the land.</v>

1567
01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:29.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's definitely,</v>

1568
01:13:30.180 --> 01:13:32.280
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely possible to do those </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of things.</v>

1569
01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:34.100
<v Speaker 1>But as far as quality of life and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>longevity,</v>

1570
01:13:34.620 --> 01:13:36.390
<v Speaker 1>longevity of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1571
01:13:36.510 --> 01:13:39.630
<v Speaker 1>the collaboration ends up actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>fitting better that community,</v>

1572
01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:43.950
<v Speaker 1>that village ends up really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really working hard to find that though,</v>

1573
01:13:43.951 --> 01:13:46.890
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to find some likeminded people</v>

1574
01:13:46.891 --> 01:13:49.610
<v Speaker 1>that you can enjoy it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's already happening.</v>

1575
01:13:49.730 --> 01:13:51.120
<v Speaker 1>There's an entire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's entire,</v>

1576
01:13:51.121 --> 01:13:54.900
<v Speaker 1>even where we live in Arizona,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's entire communities that have,</v>

1577
01:13:54.920 --> 01:13:55.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1578
01:13:55.410 --> 01:13:58.890
<v Speaker 1>the garden garden communities and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1579
01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:00.670
<v Speaker 1>we're making pasta is now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1580
01:14:01.050 --> 01:14:05.040
<v Speaker 1>that are from 100 percent Arizona wheat </v>
<v Speaker 1>so we can grow wheat,</v>

1581
01:14:05.041 --> 01:14:09.450
<v Speaker 1>we make the flower and I can actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>make pastas for you to go with the wine,</v>

1582
01:14:09.451 --> 01:14:11.710
<v Speaker 1>which we also grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the things we can't,</v>

1583
01:14:11.820 --> 01:14:13.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't make salt,</v>

1584
01:14:14.190 --> 01:14:19.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like spices you would like to </v>

1585
01:14:19.190 --> 01:14:20.791
<v Speaker 1>have and that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's ends up being your back to the </v>

1586
01:14:20.791 --> 01:14:20.791
<v Speaker 1>trading,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trading your.</v>

1587
01:14:20.791 --> 01:14:22.780
<v Speaker 1>Whereas with other communities and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>

1588
01:14:24.070 --> 01:14:27.610
<v Speaker 1>But then just all the nutrition that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>just get the basic,</v>

1589
01:14:27.670 --> 01:14:32.670
<v Speaker 1>a fulfillment of that homegrown stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It resonates on a microfiber level in </v>

1590
01:14:35.321 --> 01:14:36.310
<v Speaker 1>your body for sure.</v>

1591
01:14:36.460 --> 01:14:37.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty bad ass.</v>

1592
01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:40.390
<v Speaker 2>And Arizona is a tricky place to because</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guys don't get a lot of rain.</v>

1593
01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:42.970
<v Speaker 2>We get a little bit of rain and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a matter of.</v>

1594
01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:43.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1595
01:14:43.040 --> 01:14:45.560
<v Speaker 1>making sure you're planting in the right</v>
<v Speaker 1>spot where the rain gets to</v>

1596
01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:49.840
<v Speaker 2>the cisterns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cisterns,</v>

1597
01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:51.640
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you have water storage?</v>

1598
01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:55.330
<v Speaker 2>Carry the rain water and figure out a </v>
<v Speaker 2>way to move it.</v>

1599
01:14:56.180 --> 01:14:57.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's um,</v>

1600
01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.550
<v Speaker 2>if you ever thought about living </v>
<v Speaker 2>somewhere where it rains a lot,</v>

1601
01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:03.710

1628
01:16:16.830 --> 01:16:21.830
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a show called monster quest </v>

1629
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.830
<v Speaker 2>where there were jaguars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1630
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.830
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1631
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.950

<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1633
01:16:24.011 --> 01:16:25.330
<v Speaker 2>Jaguar in South America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>

1634
01:16:25.331 --> 01:16:27.810
<v Speaker 2>So they've started to see Jaguars in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1635
01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:28.350
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1636
01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:29.800
<v Speaker 2>in Arizona.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hunting.</v>

1637
01:16:29.801 --> 01:16:31.190
<v Speaker 2>Republicans are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1638
01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:32.000
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1639
01:16:32.050 --> 01:16:33.760
<v Speaker 2>just after a pio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just,</v>

1640
01:16:33.761 --> 01:16:38.761
<v Speaker 2>after that Joe Arpaio Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's gotta be a weird thing </v>

1641
01:16:38.761 --> 01:16:38.761
<v Speaker 2>representing your state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1642
01:16:38.761 --> 01:16:40.900
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you tell people you're from Arizona</v>

1643
01:16:40.901 --> 01:16:41.530
<v Speaker 2>and they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

1644
01:16:41.531 --> 01:16:43.300
<v Speaker 2>that's that fucking guy that makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>people wear pink.</v>

1645
01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:45.270
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1646
01:16:45.570 --> 01:16:46.350
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

1647
01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:47.550
<v Speaker 2>it's a wonderful</v>

1648
01:16:47.550 --> 01:16:51.360
<v Speaker 1>state to live in because it's the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>state of the union where the 48 state,</v>

1649
01:16:51.810 --> 01:16:54.450
<v Speaker 1>so we're kind of the infants and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of the mavericks in a way.</v>

1650
01:16:54.451 --> 01:16:57.780
<v Speaker 1>So there's all this unresolved like </v>
<v Speaker 1>archaic shit that goes on there,</v>

1651
01:16:57.781 --> 01:17:00.750
<v Speaker 1>but there's all this amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful stuff as well that we actually</v>

1652
01:17:00.751 --> 01:17:04.500
<v Speaker 1>get to do because we're not kind of part</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the east coast.</v>

1653
01:17:04.501 --> 01:17:08.010
<v Speaker 1>Like this is how it's done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have been here for 200 years.</v>

1654
01:17:08.490 --> 01:17:11.250
<v Speaker 1>It's actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're kind of still finding our way in a</v>

1655
01:17:11.251 --> 01:17:12.290
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there's,</v>

1656
01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:17.620
<v Speaker 1>there's the good and the bad that goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that and there's probably a lot </v>

1657
01:17:17.620 --> 01:17:18.680
<v Speaker 1>more bad that always it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't,</v>

1658
01:17:18.681 --> 01:17:22.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm not exposed to it because I'm good </v>
<v Speaker 1>on that note.</v>

1659
01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:23.700
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1660
01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:26.240
<v Speaker 1>the wine industry in general is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was met with like,</v>

1661
01:17:26.930 --> 01:17:27.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1662
01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:29.090
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1663
01:17:29.091 --> 01:17:30.950
<v Speaker 1>it's alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's wine,</v>

1664
01:17:30.951 --> 01:17:31.530
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1665
01:17:31.850 --> 01:17:36.850
<v Speaker 1>the religious right in the room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the conservative Republicans </v>

1666
01:17:36.850 --> 01:17:36.890
<v Speaker 1>initially were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

1667
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:41.950
<v Speaker 1>But now we've changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we completely changed the </v>

1668
01:17:41.950 --> 01:17:46.030
<v Speaker 1>agricultural and economic landscape of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that state with what we're doing with </v>

1669
01:17:46.030 --> 01:17:47.540
<v Speaker 1>the vineyards to the point where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>governor,</v>

1670
01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:52.870
<v Speaker 1>God bless her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has actually gone on record with the </v>

1671
01:17:52.870 --> 01:17:54.590
<v Speaker 1>municipalities and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>support what he's doing,</v>

1672
01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:57.800
<v Speaker 1>get behind them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how that's.</v>

1673
01:17:58.100 --> 01:18:02.330
<v Speaker 1>So to have a conservative person who was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like probably teetotal or anti alcohol,</v>

1674
01:18:02.331 --> 01:18:07.331
<v Speaker 1>all that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or have somebody like that who you </v>

1675
01:18:07.331 --> 01:18:07.331
<v Speaker 1>already know her story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like to have them support.</v>

1676
01:18:07.490 --> 01:18:10.850
<v Speaker 1>What you're doing is you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're definitely making a mark.</v>

1677
01:18:11.050 --> 01:18:12.590
<v Speaker 2>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a beautiful thing.</v>

1678
01:18:12.591 --> 01:18:14.420
<v Speaker 2>If you're governor wasn't a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>moron.</v>

1679
01:18:14.730 --> 01:18:16.610
<v Speaker 2>That chick scary dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's.</v>

1680
01:18:16.611 --> 01:18:21.611
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you've ever seen some of the debates </v>

1681
01:18:21.611 --> 01:18:23.201
<v Speaker 2>with her holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they asked her questions and she </v>

1682
01:18:23.201 --> 01:18:24.370
<v Speaker 2>just locked up and just stopped talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're like,</v>

1683
01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:29.380
<v Speaker 2>you're not allowed to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not a lot of stop talking and then she </v>

1684
01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:29.380
<v Speaker 2>still won.</v>

1685
01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:31.220
<v Speaker 1>Whatever that means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1686
01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:33.330
<v Speaker 1>She supports you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1687
01:18:33.331 --> 01:18:34.030
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1688
01:18:34.060 --> 01:18:39.060
<v Speaker 1>it's an amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's amazing thing to witness the kind </v>

1689
01:18:39.060 --> 01:18:39.090
<v Speaker 1>of the naysayers coming around to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1690
01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:41.050
<v Speaker 1>having to like explain to them over and </v>
<v Speaker 1>over again.</v>

1691
01:18:41.051 --> 01:18:46.051
<v Speaker 1>There's like these small communities in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe that they weather whatever storm </v>

1692
01:18:46.051 --> 01:18:47.610
<v Speaker 1>you throw it out and they don't care </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's king or dictator frozen it.</v>

1693
01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:52.920
<v Speaker 1>Third small communities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're small community to grow their </v>

1694
01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:52.920
<v Speaker 1>own food and the and the cornerstone of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

1695
01:18:53.200 --> 01:18:56.830
<v Speaker 1>of their economic stability is our </v>
<v Speaker 1>vineyards and you know,</v>

1696
01:18:56.831 --> 01:19:01.831
<v Speaker 1>something that takes dedication and time</v>
<v Speaker 1>and focus and commitment to a long term </v>

1697
01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:07.680
<v Speaker 1>thing and then everything around it can </v>
<v Speaker 1>then sustain itself based on that being </v>

1698
01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:08.020
<v Speaker 1>the hub.</v>

1699
01:19:08.620 --> 01:19:13.620
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever recognize how unique this is</v>
<v Speaker 2>for someone who has achieved your </v>

1700
01:19:13.620 --> 01:19:16.420
<v Speaker 2>position as a musician and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has some,</v>

1701
01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:21.700
<v Speaker 2>has so much cultural influence to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>this sort of radical change and just go </v>

1702
01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:26.671
<v Speaker 2>off and start a vineyard and become a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a small local business?</v>

1703
01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:29.760
<v Speaker 1>No aid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The community like that.</v>

1704
01:19:29.761 --> 01:19:34.761
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a really kind of an unusual </v>

1705
01:19:34.761 --> 01:19:34.761
<v Speaker 1>departure.</v>

1706
01:19:34.761 --> 01:19:36.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's only a departure if you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>only looking at the part of my life that</v>

1707
01:19:36.451 --> 01:19:38.790
<v Speaker 1>had to do with music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're looking at the part of my life</v>

1708
01:19:38.791 --> 01:19:40.570
<v Speaker 1>that came before the music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1709
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:42.420
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was part of the military.</v>

1710
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:47.950
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was accepted to west point it become </v>

1711
01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:49.050
<v Speaker 1>an officer and I chose not to go to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to go into the arts.</v>

1712
01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:51.930
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I was in some way already doing these</v>

1713
01:19:51.931 --> 01:19:53.070
<v Speaker 1>kinds of things in a way,</v>

<v Speaker 1>politicians.</v>

1715
01:19:55.620 --> 01:20:00.620
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was kind of part of that part of that </v>

1716
01:20:00.620 --> 01:20:01.380
<v Speaker 1>structure to begin with organized </v>
<v Speaker 1>sports,</v>

1717
01:20:01.440 --> 01:20:02.910
<v Speaker 1>military ballet.</v>

1718
01:20:05.550 --> 01:20:07.050
<v Speaker 2>So you've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've pocket pool,</v>

1719
01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:12.140
<v Speaker 2>you've managed to really be your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>unique individual.</v>

1720
01:20:12.241 --> 01:20:17.241
<v Speaker 2>You've really managed to not find a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pattern to fall into but rather fall </v>

1721
01:20:17.241 --> 01:20:19.050
<v Speaker 2>into the pattern that you felt </v>
<v Speaker 2>personally</v>

1722
01:20:19.070 --> 01:20:20.810
<v Speaker 1>drawn to kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1723
01:20:20.811 --> 01:20:23.210
<v Speaker 1>going back to just following your </v>
<v Speaker 1>intuition about what your decision.</v>

1724
01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:25.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean when you're standing there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're having to make a decision,</v>

1725
01:20:25.701 --> 01:20:28.130
<v Speaker 1>like when you received that appointment </v>
<v Speaker 1>in your hand going,</v>

1726
01:20:28.131 --> 01:20:30.410
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be an officer,</v>

1727
01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:32.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go to west point when I get</v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

1728
01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:35.570
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see my future all the way to the,</v>

1729
01:20:35.600 --> 01:20:37.160
<v Speaker 1>to the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1730
01:20:37.161 --> 01:20:42.161
<v Speaker 1>classmates of mine are now like kernels </v>
<v Speaker 1>in charge of several divisions in </v>

1731
01:20:42.230 --> 01:20:44.510
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that would be,</v>

1732
01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:46.370
<v Speaker 1>that would be what I'd be doing right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

1733
01:20:46.430 --> 01:20:47.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1734
01:20:47.330 --> 01:20:52.330
<v Speaker 1>I can't say that for sure because I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>not nearly the day dedicated soldier </v>

1735
01:20:52.330 --> 01:20:54.020
<v Speaker 1>that those guys are and that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>vision.</v>

1736
01:20:54.021 --> 01:20:56.360
<v Speaker 1>But as far as that part of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporation,</v>

1737
01:20:56.361 --> 01:20:59.910
<v Speaker 1>that part of that company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I was what I was,</v>

1738
01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:01.940
<v Speaker 1>that's my path was laid out in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

1739
01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:06.380
<v Speaker 1>So to see that and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can be a part of that whole thing or I</v>

1740
01:21:06.381 --> 01:21:10.520
<v Speaker 1>can follow this feeling in my stomach </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now and go,</v>

1741
01:21:11.180 --> 01:21:16.180
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm going to go to art school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So to actually make that decision and </v>

1742
01:21:16.180 --> 01:21:17.900
<v Speaker 1>have all your friends and your family </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of go,</v>

1743
01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:23.320
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck did you just do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was long before you'd ever </v>

1744
01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:25.880
<v Speaker 1>heard about me and to know that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I was supposed to do.</v>

1745
01:21:26.790 --> 01:21:30.320
<v Speaker 1>And to follow that against anybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>else's advice.</v>

1746
01:21:30.770 --> 01:21:33.150
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1747
01:21:33.170 --> 01:21:34.430
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a strong,</v>

1748
01:21:34.460 --> 01:21:37.910
<v Speaker 1>a strong statement when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>following one's intuition,</v>

1749
01:21:38.160 --> 01:21:40.020
<v Speaker 2>do you realize how inspirational that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is?</v>

1750
01:21:40.021 --> 01:21:41.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a guy like me or two,</v>

1751
01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:44.460
<v Speaker 2>especially two guys coming up that may,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1752
01:21:44.520 --> 01:21:46.140
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or they have a vision,</v>

1753
01:21:46.141 --> 01:21:49.020
<v Speaker 2>they have an idea and they see someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>like you that they admire,</v>

1754
01:21:49.021 --> 01:21:54.021
<v Speaker 2>that has done that and really has so </v>
<v Speaker 2>obviously carved out the life that they </v>

1755
01:21:54.991 --> 01:21:58.530
<v Speaker 2>really wanted to live based on their </v>
<v Speaker 2>intuition,</v>

1756
01:21:58.531 --> 01:22:01.470
<v Speaker 2>based on their idea which so few people </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever actually do.</v>

1757
01:22:01.650 --> 01:22:03.450
<v Speaker 2>We recognize that influence me because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>

1758
01:22:03.451 --> 01:22:05.130
<v Speaker 2>that's a huge thing for folks.</v>

1759
01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:06.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always.</v>

1760
01:22:06.230 --> 01:22:08.090
<v Speaker 1>It's always going to come down to what </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1761
01:22:08.690 --> 01:22:10.910
<v Speaker 1>what you were going to decide for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1762
01:22:11.090 --> 01:22:13.080
<v Speaker 1>it's Kinda hard to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a,</v>

1763

<v Speaker 1>my old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Michigan.</v>

1766
01:22:17.601 --> 01:22:20.560

<v Speaker 1>I did go to a church that's,</v>

1767
01:22:20.570 --> 01:22:22.600
<v Speaker 1>I might disappoint you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>a pastor,</v>

1770
01:22:25.820 --> 01:22:26.850
<v Speaker 1>I should say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1771
01:22:27.130 --> 01:22:32.130
<v Speaker 1>and the only reason I went to this place</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the guy made this guy made </v>

1772
01:22:32.130 --> 01:22:32.130
<v Speaker 1>sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Super Low key,</v>

1773
01:22:32.130 --> 01:22:34.040
<v Speaker 1>awesome speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He told stories,</v>

1774
01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:35.540
<v Speaker 1>had no judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1775
01:22:36.070 --> 01:22:41.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one point I was having problems </v>

1776
01:22:41.070 --> 01:22:43.391
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people or thought that it was way too </v>

1777
01:22:43.391 --> 01:22:44.960
<v Speaker 1>into kiss and Alice Cooper wanted to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>to talk to the preacher and he called me</v>

1778
01:22:44.961 --> 01:22:47.060
<v Speaker 1>in the Avi and I kind of went into his </v>
<v Speaker 1>place and he went,</v>

1779
01:22:47.150 --> 01:22:49.640
<v Speaker 1>he shut the door and go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so tell me all about this band.</v>

1780
01:22:49.910 --> 01:22:52.670
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can eat freely and as a small look,</v>

1781
01:22:52.690 --> 01:22:55.130
<v Speaker 1>and he just listened to all of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1782
01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:57.220
<v Speaker 1>Then he started kissing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1783
01:22:59.630 --> 01:23:04.630
<v Speaker 1>can you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you say that with your pants off or </v>

1784
01:23:04.630 --> 01:23:05.150
<v Speaker 1>nothing like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was nothing.</v>

1785
01:23:05.170 --> 01:23:10.170
<v Speaker 1>He was just into like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what is it about this that like </v>

1786
01:23:10.170 --> 01:23:10.170
<v Speaker 1>resonates with you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

1787
01:23:10.170 --> 01:23:13.060
<v Speaker 1>What is it that inspires you about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I was like telling me stories.</v>

1788
01:23:13.061 --> 01:23:14.320
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a storyteller.</v>

1789
01:23:15.160 --> 01:23:17.890
<v Speaker 1>I like that you'd like to tell stories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You should tell him more stories.</v>

1790
01:23:18.190 --> 01:23:23.190
<v Speaker 1>And I started writing poetry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started writing stuff based on that </v>

1791
01:23:23.190 --> 01:23:24.800
<v Speaker 1>conversation with him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>

1792
01:23:24.970 --> 01:23:29.970
<v Speaker 1>out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they used to tell the story that I </v>

1793
01:23:29.970 --> 01:23:29.970
<v Speaker 1>thought was very pertinent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1794
01:23:29.970 --> 01:23:33.870
<v Speaker 1>you'd go off to camp and you'd have some</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience there and you come back and </v>

1795
01:23:34.361 --> 01:23:37.060
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you experienced out there,</v>

1796
01:23:37.090 --> 01:23:42.090
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever camp that was you went to </v>

1797
01:23:42.090 --> 01:23:42.090
<v Speaker 1>metaphorically and you come back to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>general populous,</v>

1798
01:23:42.130 --> 01:23:42.680
<v Speaker 1>it's you.</v>

1799
01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:47.760
<v Speaker 1>He would always tell the story about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Moses coming down from the mountain and </v>

1800
01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:49.850
<v Speaker 1>having his mountain top experience and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then coming back down to the rat race to</v>

1801
01:23:49.860 --> 01:23:52.360
<v Speaker 1>where people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a changed person.</v>

1802
01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:57.390
<v Speaker 1>There's something different in his eyes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's watching everything that's </v>

1803
01:23:57.390 --> 01:24:00.271
<v Speaker 1>happening and there's no possible way he</v>
<v Speaker 1>will ever be able to like explain to his</v>

1804
01:24:01.490 --> 01:24:06.490
<v Speaker 1>people that he sees daily what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened because they didn't happen to </v>

1805
01:24:06.490 --> 01:24:06.490
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happened to him.</v>

1806
01:24:06.490 --> 01:24:10.220
<v Speaker 1>He saw it and it just has to kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1807
01:24:10.350 --> 01:24:13.070
<v Speaker 1>his life on that and not be disappointed</v>
<v Speaker 1>in his,</v>

1808
01:24:13.090 --> 01:24:16.180
<v Speaker 1>in his friends and family and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>community because they didn't see it.</v>

1809
01:24:16.181 --> 01:24:17.260
<v Speaker 1>So it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not their fault.</v>

1810
01:24:17.261 --> 01:24:18.880
<v Speaker 1>They didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't experience that.</v>

1811
01:24:18.881 --> 01:24:23.170
<v Speaker 1>But he has to like not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has to kind of understand that a,</v>

1812
01:24:23.890 --> 01:24:28.890
<v Speaker 1>everybody has to go through that </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves if they're going to go </v>

1813
01:24:28.890 --> 01:24:28.890
<v Speaker 1>through it.</v>

1814
01:24:28.890 --> 01:24:31.350
<v Speaker 1>Like the other thing we talked about </v>
<v Speaker 1>with kids going into the military and </v>

1815
01:24:31.350 --> 01:24:32.170
<v Speaker 1>having that like that moment where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on your own,</v>

1816
01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:37.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you stick your hand in the jar with the </v>

1817
01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:37.560
<v Speaker 1>ants and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>

1818
01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:39.790
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about that coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming an adult,</v>

1819
01:24:40.320 --> 01:24:43.180
<v Speaker 1>a Houston.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would tell that story and it was very</v>

1820
01:24:43.181 --> 01:24:45.730
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very important lesson for me to go,</v>

1821
01:24:45.731 --> 01:24:48.250
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on your own with these decisions.</v>

1822
01:24:48.251 --> 01:24:50.590
<v Speaker 1>You kind of have to have these things </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not everybody's going to get it,</v>

1823
01:24:50.620 --> 01:24:52.300
<v Speaker 1>so don't worry about everybody getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1824
01:24:52.430 --> 01:24:57.430
<v Speaker 2>Just as long as folks though to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>that sort of confidence to branch out </v>

1825
01:24:57.430 --> 01:24:59.780
<v Speaker 2>independently on their own with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>vision that are terrifying.</v>

1826
01:24:59.930 --> 01:25:03.290
<v Speaker 2>It's terrifying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the only way you really.</v>

1827
01:25:03.430 --> 01:25:05.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can find your own path.</v>

1828
01:25:05.150 --> 01:25:10.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so hard for people to accept and </v>

1829
01:25:10.150 --> 01:25:10.150
<v Speaker 2>so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not what people want to hear.</v>

1830
01:25:10.150 --> 01:25:10.150
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1831
01:25:10.150 --> 01:25:10.670
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

1832
01:25:10.880 --> 01:25:12.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems.</v>

1833
01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:16.100
<v Speaker 2>It's so terrifying to be completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>independent of all the people around you</v>

1834
01:25:16.101 --> 01:25:17.420
<v Speaker 2>giving you other advice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

1835
01:25:18.220 --> 01:25:21.080
<v Speaker 1>so I want to do it and if you see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that's,</v>

1836
01:25:21.160 --> 01:25:22.440
<v Speaker 1>that's how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how things happen.</v>

1837
01:25:22.441 --> 01:25:27.441
<v Speaker 1>You see something that's not being done </v>
<v Speaker 1>or you see something that's your you </v>

1838
01:25:27.441 --> 01:25:27.770
<v Speaker 1>want to have happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it's not happening,</v>

1839
01:25:27.780 --> 01:25:28.230
<v Speaker 1>go do it.</v>

1840
01:25:28.420 --> 01:25:33.420
<v Speaker 2>It's got to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to be honest with yourself as </v>

1841
01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:35.081
<v Speaker 2>well to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to actually know what you </v>

1842
01:25:35.081 --> 01:25:36.701
<v Speaker 2>really truly want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people will talk themselves </v>

1843
01:25:36.701 --> 01:25:39.311
<v Speaker 2>into things that they want because </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's maybe security in it or they </v>

1844
01:25:39.311 --> 01:25:43.100
<v Speaker 2>could see a connect the dots future.</v>

1858
01:26:08.450 --> 01:26:13.450

<v Speaker 1>country at 10,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1887

<v Speaker 1>pride and satisfaction in your work.</v>
