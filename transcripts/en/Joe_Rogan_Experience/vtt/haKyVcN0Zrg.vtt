00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.770
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the things that is driving me crazy about a lot of this tweeting and</v>

3
00:00:07.291 --> 00:00:07.831
<v Speaker 1>craziness.</v>

4
00:00:07.831 --> 00:00:12.831
<v Speaker 1>Like I was in a New York City for the fights and me and my friend Cam Haines who</v>

5
00:00:13.771 --> 00:00:15.960
<v Speaker 1>went to the gym and young Jamie was there too.</v>

6
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.880
<v Speaker 1>But you weren't with us when we were stuck in the,</v>

7
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.580
<v Speaker 1>in the swarm of humans with just me and cam.</v>

8
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.290
<v Speaker 1>We've got to the gym no problem.</v>

9
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.640
<v Speaker 1>But on our way back,</v>

10
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.020
<v Speaker 1>the protest had marched through the area that we walked through and all of a</v>

11
00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:29.220
<v Speaker 1>sudden we couldn't go anywhere.</v>

12
00:00:29.221 --> 00:00:30.840
<v Speaker 1>It was just jammed with people.</v>

13
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.750
<v Speaker 1>So you're literally shoulder to shoulder with people.</v>

14
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Like just everybody's touching everybody.</v>

15
00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:36.001
<v Speaker 1>There's just,</v>

16
00:00:36.001 --> 00:00:37.020
<v Speaker 1>you had to deal with it.</v>

17
00:00:37.021 --> 00:00:37.980
<v Speaker 1>There was nothing to do with,</v>

18
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.530
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the reasons why a fanny pack is so important folks.</v>

19
00:00:40.531 --> 00:00:41.760
<v Speaker 1>Cause you keep your money in your front.</v>

20
00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.241
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

21
00:00:42.241 --> 00:00:44.310
<v Speaker 1>Nobody's pickpocket and I can think zipped up,</v>

22
00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.260
<v Speaker 1>my shirt goes over that I'm going to know and to get there,</v>

23
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.360
<v Speaker 1>it's going to take some work cause pickpockets do go to those things you need to</v>

24
00:00:51.361 --> 00:00:52.470
<v Speaker 1>be aware of.</v>

25
00:00:52.471 --> 00:00:54.060
<v Speaker 1>You're one of those super lefties.</v>

26
00:00:54.061 --> 00:00:56.610
<v Speaker 1>It likes to go and castrate you Shit Jack.</v>

27
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.270
<v Speaker 1>So while we're walking this one guy with this perfectly manicured beard,</v>

28
00:01:02.311 --> 00:01:02.851
<v Speaker 1>I'll never forget,</v>

29
00:01:02.851 --> 00:01:05.400
<v Speaker 1>he had a really nice like wool jacket on.</v>

30
00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.120
<v Speaker 1>He was,</v>

31
00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.590
<v Speaker 1>he was obviously like a wealthy liberal character and he's screaming out.</v>

32
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean screaming in my fucking ear.</v>

33
00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.610
<v Speaker 1>He's right here.</v>

34
00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:14.941
<v Speaker 1>He's real.</v>

35
00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:15.840
<v Speaker 1>He's touching me,</v>

36
00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:16.641
<v Speaker 1>he's touching me.</v>

37
00:01:16.641 --> 00:01:18.620
<v Speaker 1>The shoulders know Donald Trump.</v>

38
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.101
<v Speaker 1>K,</v>

39
00:01:19.101 --> 00:01:19.431
<v Speaker 1>k.</v>

40
00:01:19.431 --> 00:01:20.810
<v Speaker 1>K.</v>

41
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.811
<v Speaker 1>Racist,</v>

42
00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:21.644
<v Speaker 1>sexist.</v>

43
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.410
<v Speaker 1>But he wouldn't stop.</v>

44
00:01:24.411 --> 00:01:25.430
<v Speaker 1>He wouldn't stop.</v>

45
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.050
<v Speaker 1>And part of me wanting to go,</v>

46
00:01:27.051 --> 00:01:27.471
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

47
00:01:27.471 --> 00:01:28.304
<v Speaker 1>could you just like,</v>

48
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:29.990
<v Speaker 1>if you want to go in the protest,</v>

49
00:01:29.991 --> 00:01:31.310
<v Speaker 1>the protest is in the street.</v>

50
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.140
<v Speaker 1>Like you're on the sidewalk.</v>

51
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.610
<v Speaker 1>This isn't the protest.</v>

52
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.791
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

53
00:01:34.791 --> 00:01:35.780
<v Speaker 1>this is the salon.</v>

54
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.230
<v Speaker 1>This is some noncommittal shit you're doing here.</v>

55
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.860
<v Speaker 1>Like if you want to be out in,</v>

56
00:01:39.861 --> 00:01:40.760
<v Speaker 1>he'll be all in.</v>

57
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:41.211
<v Speaker 1>But he's like,</v>

58
00:01:41.211 --> 00:01:42.380
<v Speaker 1>he's doing drive bys.</v>

59
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.750
<v Speaker 1>He's like a walk by screaming protests.</v>

60
00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.370
<v Speaker 1>But does it really do anything?</v>

61
00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:47.690
<v Speaker 1>He saw a black guy and a distance.</v>

62
00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:49.030
<v Speaker 1>I swear to God he starts going shut up.</v>

63
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.120
<v Speaker 1>Black lives matter.</v>

64
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.120
<v Speaker 1>Black lives matter.</v>

65
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.013
<v Speaker 1>Hell No.</v>

66
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.963
<v Speaker 1>Oh hell.</v>

67
00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.280
<v Speaker 1>He's just trying to get everybody to join him with my friend Michael Shermer</v>

68
00:01:57.281 --> 00:01:59.290
<v Speaker 1>likes to call virtue signaling.</v>

69
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.101
<v Speaker 1>That's what it is.</v>

70
00:02:00.101 --> 00:02:03.030
<v Speaker 1>He's peacocking his virtue and just trying,</v>

71
00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.950
<v Speaker 1>just trying to get everybody to jump on.</v>

72
00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.890
<v Speaker 1>There was a woman with a sign that said Rape Millennia,</v>

73
00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.563
<v Speaker 1>Cisa,</v>

74
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.350
<v Speaker 1>and apparently that's about writing that thing out.</v>

75
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

76
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.571
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>

77
00:02:17.571 --> 00:02:18.840
<v Speaker 1>It's a Hashtag on Twitter.</v>

78
00:02:18.841 --> 00:02:19.674
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

79
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:20.420
<v Speaker 2>look as a,</v>

80
00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.020
<v Speaker 2>as a Brit observing what's been happening in America as an outsider,</v>

81
00:02:24.021 --> 00:02:28.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm enormously encouraged by the legalization of cannabis movement that is,</v>

82
00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.160
<v Speaker 2>that is taking place here and and,</v>

83
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.790
<v Speaker 2>and what it and what it all means.</v>

84
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.691
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

85
00:02:32.691 --> 00:02:33.650
<v Speaker 2>I liked to smoke a joint,</v>

86
00:02:33.651 --> 00:02:35.120
<v Speaker 2>but this is not about getting high.</v>

87
00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:36.200
<v Speaker 2>It's not about recreation.</v>

88
00:02:36.201 --> 00:02:40.910
<v Speaker 2>What this is about is recognizing the sovereignty of adults to make decisions</v>

89
00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:42.110
<v Speaker 2>over their own bodies,</v>

90
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.830
<v Speaker 2>their own health and their own consciousness while doing no harm to others.</v>

91
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:46.760
<v Speaker 2>That's what it's about,</v>

92
00:02:46.761 --> 00:02:49.250
<v Speaker 2>and that's a really fucking important issue.</v>

93
00:02:49.251 --> 00:02:50.150
<v Speaker 2>That is for me,</v>

94
00:02:50.151 --> 00:02:53.510
<v Speaker 2>that is the most important issue because if we live in a society that is not</v>

95
00:02:53.511 --> 00:02:57.050
<v Speaker 2>prepared to recognize adults sovereignty over one's own body,</v>

96
00:02:57.051 --> 00:02:58.220
<v Speaker 2>in one's own consciousness,</v>

97
00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.540
<v Speaker 2>then that cannot be a free society in any meaningful way.</v>

98
00:03:01.541 --> 00:03:05.830
<v Speaker 2>And so I applaud the people of America in those states who have voted for full</v>

99
00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 2>legalization.</v>

100
00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.090
<v Speaker 2>That's a brilliant thing to do and that's going to have an impact around the</v>

101
00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:11.470
<v Speaker 2>world because the war on drugs,</v>

102
00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.420
<v Speaker 2>all the ideology and lies about cannabis are all going to be proved wrong.</v>

103
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.180
<v Speaker 2>We're going to know that the emperor wears no clothes,</v>

104
00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:23.170
<v Speaker 2>that you can legalize cannabis and civilization does not fall apart as the war</v>

105
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:25.300
<v Speaker 2>on drugs lobby had been telling us for ages.</v>

106
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:26.403
<v Speaker 2>It's going to,</v>

107
00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.670
<v Speaker 2>it's going to change everything.</v>

108
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:29.980
<v Speaker 2>And it's a beautiful thing because it's the American people.</v>

109
00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:34.981
<v Speaker 2>Whereas the American state America as a governmental state presence on the world</v>

110
00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:39.040
<v Speaker 2>stage has been the dark force behind the war on drugs.</v>

111
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.083
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>

112
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:41.010
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>

113
00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.380
<v Speaker 2>for me a beautiful thing that is the American people's state by state who are</v>

114
00:03:44.381 --> 00:03:45.760
<v Speaker 2>winding that back and saying,</v>

115
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.950
<v Speaker 2>we will not put up with this shit anymore.</v>

116
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.851
<v Speaker 3>I'm not sure.</v>

117
00:03:48.851 --> 00:03:50.020
<v Speaker 3>I think we need to under,</v>

118
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:50.261
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

119
00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:54.460
<v Speaker 3>the more we figure out about like way a language golf in language,</v>

120
00:03:54.461 --> 00:03:55.010
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

121
00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.390
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

122
00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.021
<v Speaker 3>there's really,</v>

123
00:03:56.021 --> 00:03:56.351
<v Speaker 3>Jimmy,</v>

124
00:03:56.351 --> 00:03:56.980
<v Speaker 3>if you look,</v>

125
00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.300
<v Speaker 3>you might be able to dig it up.</v>

126
00:03:58.301 --> 00:03:58.691
<v Speaker 3>There's a,</v>

127
00:03:58.691 --> 00:04:01.480
<v Speaker 3>there's a guy I want to say is that northern Arizona University who worked on</v>

128
00:04:01.481 --> 00:04:02.860
<v Speaker 3>prairie dog language,</v>

129
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:04.050
<v Speaker 3>if you have you heard about this,</v>

130
00:04:04.051 --> 00:04:05.320
<v Speaker 3>this is crazy research.</v>

131
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.550
<v Speaker 3>So one of the reasons we've never been able to study animal communication,</v>

132
00:04:09.551 --> 00:04:10.660
<v Speaker 3>and I could screw this up,</v>

133
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:11.920
<v Speaker 3>but we'll try it,</v>

134
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.560
<v Speaker 3>is we couldn't talk back,</v>

135
00:04:14.561 --> 00:04:14.771
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

136
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:15.910
<v Speaker 3>We couldn't talk to them.</v>

137
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.140
<v Speaker 3>So what he did is he recorded it,</v>

138
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.280
<v Speaker 3>ton of prairie dog communication and then started sort of decoding what little</v>

139
00:04:23.471 --> 00:04:27.010
<v Speaker 3>things mean and but use the computer to play it back to them.</v>

140
00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.740
<v Speaker 3>So what he discovered is prairie dogs,</v>

141
00:04:29.741 --> 00:04:31.750
<v Speaker 3>which you don't think of it as particularly intelligent.</v>

142
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.610
<v Speaker 3>When they'd started decoding their language,</v>

143
00:04:33.611 --> 00:04:34.450
<v Speaker 3>they started to realize it.</v>

144
00:04:34.451 --> 00:04:37.060
<v Speaker 3>Prairie dogs were teeny say things like,</v>

145
00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.930
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

146
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.860
<v Speaker 3>be careful of that right path over there cause there's a fat guy in a purple</v>

147
00:04:41.861 --> 00:04:43.630
<v Speaker 3>sweater coming this way.</v>

148
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:45.930
<v Speaker 3>That detailed like in the beginning of the [inaudible].</v>

149
00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:46.121
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

150
00:04:46.121 --> 00:04:50.020
<v Speaker 3>They used to think animals only sort of communicated in like nouns and verbs.</v>

151
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.210
<v Speaker 3>Present tense nouns and verbs,</v>

152
00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.930
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

153
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:53.960
<v Speaker 3>Snake of the,</v>

154
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.491
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

155
00:04:54.491 --> 00:04:56.780
<v Speaker 3>there are some certain calls that are monkeys two days,</v>

156
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:57.340
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

157
00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.120
<v Speaker 3>The three calls now they're starting to realize they've got adjectives,</v>

158
00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.470
<v Speaker 3>they've got tenses.</v>

159
00:05:02.471 --> 00:05:03.304
<v Speaker 3>They can think in the,</v>

160
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.680
<v Speaker 3>for a while they thought animals lived in a perpetual,</v>

161
00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:06.190
<v Speaker 3>pleasant,</v>

162
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.671
<v Speaker 3>present,</v>

163
00:05:06.671 --> 00:05:07.220
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

164
00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:11.140
<v Speaker 3>Like the argument was all animals are always in flow bright,</v>

165
00:05:11.141 --> 00:05:12.370
<v Speaker 3>which is the every focused,</v>

166
00:05:12.371 --> 00:05:14.590
<v Speaker 3>everything in the now it turns out that's not the case at all.</v>

167
00:05:14.591 --> 00:05:15.311
<v Speaker 3>They have passed,</v>

168
00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:16.240
<v Speaker 3>they have futures.</v>

169
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:20.110
<v Speaker 3>We asked this question a lot running an animal sanctuary because if we,</v>

170
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:21.850
<v Speaker 3>if we're caring for a dog,</v>

171
00:05:21.851 --> 00:05:23.590
<v Speaker 3>it's not just older special needs.</v>

172
00:05:23.591 --> 00:05:24.660
<v Speaker 3>It's compromise.</v>

173
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.120
<v Speaker 3>Shelter was on death row is probably if it's ended up with us because we work</v>

174
00:05:28.121 --> 00:05:29.380
<v Speaker 3>with the worst of the worst of the worst.</v>

175
00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.400
<v Speaker 3>It's been very,</v>

176
00:05:30.401 --> 00:05:31.570
<v Speaker 3>very badly abused,</v>

177
00:05:31.571 --> 00:05:31.891
<v Speaker 3>et Cetera,</v>

178
00:05:31.891 --> 00:05:32.201
<v Speaker 3>et cetera.</v>

179
00:05:32.201 --> 00:05:36.190
<v Speaker 3>And the question my wife and I always used to talk about was do they know,</v>

180
00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.090
<v Speaker 3>do they like,</v>

181
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.740
<v Speaker 3>do they feel grateful to us?</v>

182
00:05:38.741 --> 00:05:39.250
<v Speaker 3>Do they,</v>

183
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:42.040
<v Speaker 3>can they remember their past enough to know that,</v>

184
00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.700
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

185
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.470
<v Speaker 3>the present is different and we were,</v>

186
00:05:44.471 --> 00:05:44.801
<v Speaker 3>we were,</v>

187
00:05:44.801 --> 00:05:45.341
<v Speaker 3>what was different?</v>

188
00:05:45.341 --> 00:05:46.600
<v Speaker 3>Like those kinds of questions.</v>

189
00:05:46.601 --> 00:05:47.370
<v Speaker 3>And after,</v>

190
00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

191
00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.420
<v Speaker 3>10 12 years of doing this work,</v>

192
00:05:49.421 --> 00:05:49.901
<v Speaker 3>hard core,</v>

193
00:05:49.901 --> 00:05:51.700
<v Speaker 3>I think they really know and I think,</v>

194
00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:52.151
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

195
00:05:52.151 --> 00:05:52.780
<v Speaker 3>they live in a,</v>

196
00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.570
<v Speaker 3>in a timescale that's a lot broader than we've given them credit for.</v>

197
00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.680
<v Speaker 3>When you do see</v>

198
00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.480
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff on TV,</v>

199
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:00.800
<v Speaker 1>one thing that you can't deny,</v>

200
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:02.930
<v Speaker 1>it might not affect you and it might not affect me,</v>

201
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:06.800
<v Speaker 1>but there are certain people that fall the tone of the leaders of this country.</v>

202
00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:12.100
<v Speaker 1>And when you have a guy who's the president who you know is going to say</v>

203
00:06:12.291 --> 00:06:12.981
<v Speaker 1>insulting,</v>

204
00:06:12.981 --> 00:06:16.680
<v Speaker 1>should call John Stewart a pussy and an in a tweet at one 30 in the morning,</v>

205
00:06:16.681 --> 00:06:20.540
<v Speaker 1>like that sets the tone for the country and it's going to make some people very</v>

206
00:06:20.541 --> 00:06:21.200
<v Speaker 1>happy.</v>

207
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:24.050
<v Speaker 1>There's some people that love to talk shit they loved and salt people on the</v>

208
00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:24.231
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

209
00:06:24.231 --> 00:06:25.064
<v Speaker 1>fuck yeah,</v>

210
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.120
<v Speaker 1>open season.</v>

211
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:27.171
<v Speaker 1>The way I described it,</v>

212
00:06:27.171 --> 00:06:30.830
<v Speaker 1>I said political correctness took a missile to the dick cause that's what it was</v>

213
00:06:30.831 --> 00:06:31.021
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

214
00:06:31.021 --> 00:06:31.520
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

215
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:32.180
<v Speaker 1>this is the,</v>

216
00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:35.450
<v Speaker 1>this is the guy at the top of the totem pole and we,</v>

217
00:06:35.451 --> 00:06:38.350
<v Speaker 1>we can relax our standards now and all the things that have been annoying you,</v>

218
00:06:38.351 --> 00:06:42.010
<v Speaker 1>but people nitpicking about behaviors and insults and you know,</v>

219
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.230
<v Speaker 1>safe words and safe spaces and all that stuff's Kinda gone.</v>

220
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:46.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

221
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:47.121
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

222
00:06:47.121 --> 00:06:47.450
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

223
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:51.380
<v Speaker 1>So it does affect the way people think and behave right there.</v>

224
00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:54.580
<v Speaker 1>There's almost nobody who won't use the word Pussy in public there.</v>

225
00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.510
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember so many months ago when that just wasn't a thing?</v>

226
00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:00.650
<v Speaker 1>That's so true.</v>

227
00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.640
<v Speaker 1>You couldn't say that.</v>

228
00:07:01.641 --> 00:07:02.840
<v Speaker 1>That's so drew.</v>

229
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:06.440
<v Speaker 1>It became like a constant like dinner table talk.</v>

230
00:07:06.441 --> 00:07:08.600
<v Speaker 1>Like people sit around and talk at saint grabbed the busy.</v>

231
00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:09.140
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

232
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.060
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be from women.</v>

233
00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.580
<v Speaker 1>That's how it got even better.</v>

234
00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:14.240
<v Speaker 1>My girlfriend said it's true.</v>

235
00:07:14.241 --> 00:07:15.230
<v Speaker 1>It's so true.</v>

236
00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.670
<v Speaker 1>That is so true.</v>

237
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:17.960
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>

238
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

239
00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.333
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

240
00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:19.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

241
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.780
<v Speaker 1>I think that we go one way and we go to the other and I think that people get</v>

242
00:07:23.781 --> 00:07:25.280
<v Speaker 1>tired of too much left and they want some.</v>

243
00:07:25.281 --> 00:07:25.580
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

244
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.340
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's why we went from Carter to Reagan.</v>

245
00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.140
<v Speaker 1>That's why we went from Bush to Clinton.</v>

246
00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:31.640
<v Speaker 1>I just think that's what we do,</v>

247
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:33.130
<v Speaker 1>I think is what we've always done.</v>

248
00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:42.560
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
