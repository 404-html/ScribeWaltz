1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.220
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just seems the problem with the</v>

2
00:00:02.221 --> 00:00:03.690
<v Speaker 1>marijuana is five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>

3
00:00:03.691 --> 00:00:04.770
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

4
00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.290
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dennis Mckenna,</v>

5
00:00:07.291 --> 00:00:10.830
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we were just discussing how I was</v>

6
00:00:10.831 --> 00:00:14.400
<v Speaker 1>saying that marijuana can be your friend</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it can enhance your life,</v>

7
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.890
<v Speaker 1>but if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take too much,</v>

8
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.320
<v Speaker 1>it's such a seductive little creature</v>
<v Speaker 1>because a little bit of it as like,</v>

9
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is nice,</v>

10
00:00:22.741 --> 00:00:25.140
<v Speaker 1>this feels good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you get too crazy,</v>

11
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.170
<v Speaker 1>especially if you get too crazy with</v>
<v Speaker 1>edibles,</v>

12
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.450
<v Speaker 1>it'll take you and take you away on this</v>
<v Speaker 1>wild journey of paranoia and,</v>

13
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.280
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you'll,</v>

14
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.190
<v Speaker 1>it'll lock you up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like some people just need to take a</v>

15
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.470
<v Speaker 1>couple of weeks off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just relax.</v>

16
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.340
<v Speaker 1>That's always a good idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

17
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.691
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

18
00:00:42.691 --> 00:00:46.050
<v Speaker 1>I think people underestimate cannabis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it can be like,</v>

19
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.960
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't really sort of knock you off</v>

20
00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:52.440
<v Speaker 1>your center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's edible and like all</v>

21
00:00:52.441 --> 00:00:54.330
<v Speaker 1>these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to learn how to use it.</v>

22
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's basically that's what you</v>

23
00:00:56.581 --> 00:00:59.280
<v Speaker 1>gotta do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll have to learn how to use it,</v>

24
00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.470
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

25
00:01:01.471 --> 00:01:04.890
<v Speaker 1>that's my raps rap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a great wrap.</v>

26
00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:06.390
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so important.</v>

27
00:01:06.391 --> 00:01:08.370
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's so important for people to</v>

28
00:01:08.371 --> 00:01:12.480
<v Speaker 1>realize that he got to let like regular</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

29
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.630
<v Speaker 1>like you like natural sober you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's important to be in touch with that.</v>

30
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.130
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't want them always be high</v>
<v Speaker 1>or always be caffeinated or always be</v>

31
00:01:23.131 --> 00:01:24.900
<v Speaker 1>anything like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

32
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.160
<v Speaker 1>I mean we're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

33
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.880
<v Speaker 1>people get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

34
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.940
<v Speaker 1>to these places and they fail to do a</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality check on themselves,</v>

35
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:33.661
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

36
00:01:33.661 --> 00:01:36.060
<v Speaker 1>I get emails from people all the time</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

37
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.650
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

38
00:01:37.651 --> 00:01:42.240
<v Speaker 1>life's been pretty weird lately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took mushrooms five times last week</v>

39
00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.730
<v Speaker 1>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

40
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.030
<v Speaker 1>how about you lay off for a while and</v>
<v Speaker 1>give her a chance because you know,</v>

41
00:01:51.451 --> 00:01:52.590
<v Speaker 1>they tell these stories.</v>

42
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.000
<v Speaker 1>It's like the idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

43
00:01:54.001 --> 00:01:57.250
<v Speaker 1>let's find your center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go back to baseline layoff,</v>

44
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.660
<v Speaker 1>the sauce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is you're taking and just</v>

45
00:02:00.661 --> 00:02:03.750
<v Speaker 1>chill out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to rediscover your center.</v>

46
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.500
<v Speaker 1>It seems like common sense advice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people don't do it.</v>

47
00:02:07.501 --> 00:02:09.480
<v Speaker 1>Does he?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My common sense advice but common sense</v>

48
00:02:09.481 --> 00:02:11.880
<v Speaker 1>is not common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think everybody knows that.</v>

49
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.520
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you have to do is look around,</v>

50
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.190
<v Speaker 1>realize what is it about people though</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one thing,</v>

51
00:02:17.191 --> 00:02:21.690
<v Speaker 1>dosage in any sort of a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't even have to be a substance.</v>

52
00:02:21.691 --> 00:02:23.820
<v Speaker 1>It can be an activity like gambling for</v>
<v Speaker 1>instance,</v>

53
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.260
<v Speaker 1>like once it gets in your bones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just seems like you're so compelled</v>

54
00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.050
<v Speaker 1>to just continue that behavior and and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of stopping is almost more</v>

55
00:02:36.841 --> 00:02:39.330
<v Speaker 1>painful than the idea of wrecking your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

56
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.921
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

57
00:02:39.921 --> 00:02:40.820
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

58
00:02:40.821 --> 00:02:43.590
<v Speaker 1>this addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is basically these things are</v>

59
00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.600
<v Speaker 1>reinforcing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They activate those pleasure circuits in</v>

60
00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.330
<v Speaker 1>the brain mediated mainly through</v>
<v Speaker 1>dopamine and all of these.</v>

61
00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the so called drugs with abuse,</v>

62
00:02:56.821 --> 00:02:58.890
<v Speaker 1>which I think is a terrible word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible,</v>

63
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

64
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reinforcing drugs,</v>

65
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:06.520
<v Speaker 2>the pleasure drugs work directly or</v>
<v Speaker 2>indirectly through the delta circuits</v>

66
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:10.390
<v Speaker 2>and the dopamine is like your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your button for pleasure.</v>

67
00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:13.990
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the same way that Serotonin is kind</v>

68
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:17.890
<v Speaker 2>of on the opposite side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's your button for more like euphoria,</v>

69
00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.540
<v Speaker 2>feeling good but not the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have the punch.</v>

70
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.990
<v Speaker 2>I guess that the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why people can get addicted to</v>

71
00:03:25.991 --> 00:03:28.240
<v Speaker 2>gambling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can get addicted to sex,</v>

72
00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:30.730
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't get addicted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>television.</v>

73
00:03:30.731 --> 00:03:33.840
<v Speaker 2>All of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have to be substances because</v>

74
00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:36.850
<v Speaker 2>they all hit those same circuits,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

75
00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.560
<v Speaker 2>except the psychedelics which don't work</v>
<v Speaker 2>on that reward circuitry.</v>

76
00:03:41.561 --> 00:03:43.900
<v Speaker 2>They work on a different set of</v>
<v Speaker 2>circuits,</v>

77
00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:48.640
<v Speaker 2>but yet even with those you are behavior</v>
<v Speaker 2>patterns can become addictive and then</v>

78
00:03:48.641 --> 00:03:51.790
<v Speaker 2>you can start just doing psychedelics</v>
<v Speaker 2>too much and it's not even the</v>

79
00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:53.140
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics that are doing it.</v>

80
00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.700
<v Speaker 2>It's just this compulsive need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly change your state of mind.</v>

81
00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.250
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's quite true.</v>

82
00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:01.600
<v Speaker 2>And if people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

83
00:04:01.601 --> 00:04:03.820
<v Speaker 2>the way they use psychedelics is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is</v>

84
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.560
<v Speaker 2>there are many ways to use it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but basically use the thoughtfully,</v>

85
00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can</v>

86
00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:16.420
<v Speaker 2>all the question about recreational use</v>
<v Speaker 2>versus spiritual use versus therapeutic</v>

87
00:04:16.421 --> 00:04:18.790
<v Speaker 2>use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean these are all ways to approach it</v>

88
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:22.480
<v Speaker 2>and I am not a person who says you must</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it this way.</v>

89
00:04:22.481 --> 00:04:26.140
<v Speaker 2>You must do it that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I do say is do it from an informed</v>

90
00:04:26.141 --> 00:04:29.860
<v Speaker 2>place and do approach it thoughtfully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

91
00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.480
<v Speaker 2>because I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in other words,</v>

92
00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.480
<v Speaker 2>don't you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>planned for it.</v>

93
00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:36.970
<v Speaker 2>Respect the medicine in a certain way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

94
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.240
<v Speaker 2>use it in a circumstance where you can</v>
<v Speaker 2>learn from the medicine rather than have</v>

95
00:04:42.401 --> 00:04:45.060
<v Speaker 2>the medicine be sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

96
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.560
<v Speaker 2>overlay a but over whatever else you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>doing.</v>

97
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is something that demands</v>
<v Speaker 2>attention and I think that's the best</v>

98
00:04:52.031 --> 00:04:54.820
<v Speaker 2>way to use psychedelics and for</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever,</v>

99
00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:58.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever spin you put on it is that</v>

100
00:04:58.301 --> 00:05:02.280
<v Speaker 2>spiritual as a therapeutic is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>recreational as Shamani.</v>

101
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.960
<v Speaker 2>These are all labeled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The important thing is that,</v>

102
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have the,</v>

103
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.550
<v Speaker 2>you approach the medicine itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The medicine is the teacher,</v>

104
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.320
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not The sitter,</v>

105
00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:16.400
<v Speaker 2>not the Shaman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the psychotherapist.</v>

106
00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.510
<v Speaker 2>If they're doing the right their job</v>
<v Speaker 2>correctly,</v>

107
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.910
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their job is to let you have your</v>

108
00:05:24.911 --> 00:05:28.990
<v Speaker 2>encounter with the medicine and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>medicine is what you learned from.</v>

109
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:34.240
<v Speaker 2>They're there to facilitate that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can intervene if you get anxious or</v>

110
00:05:34.241 --> 00:05:36.240
<v Speaker 2>have things go on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure you know,</v>

111
00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.590
<v Speaker 2>nobody comes to the door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing.</v>

112
00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.060
<v Speaker 2>But basically it's to facilitate a</v>
<v Speaker 2>learning opportunity where you and your</v>

113
00:05:43.061 --> 00:05:44.680
<v Speaker 2>teacher,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the medicine,</v>

114
00:05:44.681 --> 00:05:49.681
<v Speaker 2>be at Iowasca or mushrooms or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can have this intense one on one</v>

115
00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.960
<v Speaker 2>interaction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

116
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 2>I feel like with psychedelics as well as</v>
<v Speaker 2>with all these other</v>

117
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:59.430
<v Speaker 1>things that we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any kind of drug,</v>

118
00:05:59.431 --> 00:06:01.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean even coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alcohol,</v>

119
00:06:01.791 --> 00:06:04.220
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and behavior patterns,</v>

120
00:06:04.221 --> 00:06:06.740
<v Speaker 1>all these different things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think one of the things that happens</v>

121
00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:11.660
<v Speaker 1>with human beings is you get so far</v>
<v Speaker 1>along in your life in these behavior</v>

122
00:06:11.661 --> 00:06:16.661
<v Speaker 1>patterns become so tight grooves that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are carved into your psyche and then as</v>

123
00:06:19.881 --> 00:06:23.050
<v Speaker 1>you become an adult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you start to learn like,</v>

124
00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:24.740
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's got to be a better way to handle</v>

125
00:06:24.741 --> 00:06:26.540
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me figure out how to do this.</v>

126
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.600
<v Speaker 1>And it's almost like getting a car when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're really young and not learning how</v>

127
00:06:31.701 --> 00:06:35.300
<v Speaker 1>to drive until you're like in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>twenties and so you're just driving this</v>

128
00:06:35.301 --> 00:06:37.760
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's smashing into trees and grinding</v>

129
00:06:37.761 --> 00:06:40.520
<v Speaker 1>the gears and then somewhere along the</v>
<v Speaker 1>line you're like,</v>

130
00:06:40.521 --> 00:06:41.960
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm fucking myself up.</v>

131
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.420
<v Speaker 1>I have to figure out a way to do this</v>
<v Speaker 1>correctly.</v>

132
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:46.850
<v Speaker 1>And there's two different approaches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>

133
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.220
<v Speaker 1>the abstinence approach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is very popular.</v>

134
00:06:49.221 --> 00:06:49.791
<v Speaker 1>People say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

135
00:06:49.791 --> 00:06:51.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm straight edge now.</v>

136
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't do anything and that's it and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

137
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:56.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just do wheat grass and I run hills and</v>

138
00:06:56.361 --> 00:06:57.410
<v Speaker 1>stuff and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

139
00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.030
<v Speaker 1>you could do that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

140
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.340
<v Speaker 1>you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You definitely can do that too,</v>

141
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.850
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think that there's anything</v>

142
00:07:04.851 --> 00:07:08.150
<v Speaker 1>wrong with any of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's something wrong with the</v>

143
00:07:08.151 --> 00:07:11.990
<v Speaker 1>way we use them and I think it's one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the inherent problems with things being</v>

144
00:07:11.991 --> 00:07:16.991
<v Speaker 1>illegal is that we can't discuss this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have people like you or centers</v>

145
00:07:17.211 --> 00:07:22.130
<v Speaker 1>where people can go where people can</v>
<v Speaker 1>become educated on the proper way to use</v>

146
00:07:22.131 --> 00:07:24.770
<v Speaker 1>these drugs or medicines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever you want to call them,</v>

147
00:07:24.771 --> 00:07:29.150
<v Speaker 1>these compounds and get something out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them that can really be beneficial.</v>

148
00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.630
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly right.</v>

149
00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:33.340
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've said this many,</v>

150
00:07:33.341 --> 00:07:34.890
<v Speaker 2>many times that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

151
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.960
<v Speaker 2>drug education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they call drug education in this</v>

152
00:07:37.961 --> 00:07:42.070
<v Speaker 2>country is a joke because the whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>emphasis is on don't use them.</v>

153
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.800
<v Speaker 2>That's absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like telling,</v>

154
00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:49.630
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an 18 year old guy full of testosterone</v>

155
00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:51.580
<v Speaker 2>don't have sex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>

156
00:07:51.581 --> 00:07:54.910
<v Speaker 2>it's built into the genetics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to go for that.</v>

157
00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:59.800
<v Speaker 2>What you have to do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they can bring themselves to</v>

158
00:07:59.801 --> 00:08:04.690
<v Speaker 2>acknowledge in the drug education field</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it's not about telling people not to</v>

159
00:08:04.691 --> 00:08:07.810
<v Speaker 2>use drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's about teaching people how to use</v>

160
00:08:07.811 --> 00:08:11.020
<v Speaker 2>drugs</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they choose to.</v>

161
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.480
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like any other skill,</v>

162
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:17.620
<v Speaker 2>people have to learn to drive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to learn to do yoga.</v>

163
00:08:17.621 --> 00:08:19.510
<v Speaker 2>They have to learn to do whatever they</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

164
00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.620
<v Speaker 2>There's an educational process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tell people many times,</v>

165
00:08:23.621 --> 00:08:27.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my shtick is there is no such thing as a</v>

166
00:08:27.371 --> 00:08:30.610
<v Speaker 2>bad drug and that's another problem with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dialogue.</v>

167
00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:35.610
<v Speaker 2>The badness is projected onto the drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The drugs are simply compounds with a</v>

168
00:08:35.651 --> 00:08:36.880
<v Speaker 2>certain form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ecology.</v>

169
00:08:36.881 --> 00:08:40.690
<v Speaker 2>There's no moral aspect to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The moral dimension comes in.</v>

170
00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:44.560
<v Speaker 2>How do people use them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where you know it's human</v>

171
00:08:44.561 --> 00:08:47.200
<v Speaker 2>behavior that's moral or immoral life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say,</v>

172
00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:49.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no such thing as a bad drug.</v>

173
00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:55.350
<v Speaker 2>Plenty of bad ways to use drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that comes from the not the calm</v>

174
00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.590
<v Speaker 2>town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been really disturbed lately by</v>

175
00:08:58.591 --> 00:09:02.630
<v Speaker 2>these new super potent painkillers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

176
00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:06.510
<v Speaker 2>it's fentanyl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the stuff that killed prince and</v>

177
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:10.680
<v Speaker 2>carfentanil now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the big men say fentanyl is bad</v>

178
00:09:10.681 --> 00:09:15.480
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>carfentanil is something like 100 to a</v>

179
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.310
<v Speaker 2>thousand times more potent than</v>
<v Speaker 2>fentanyl.</v>

180
00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:19.500
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

181
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:24.590
<v Speaker 2>So as Spec,</v>
<v Speaker 2>literally a pinhead or less of the</v>

182
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:29.250
<v Speaker 2>Carfentanil is a lethal dose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

183
00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is really not good,</v>

184
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:37.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I am certainly not an expert on,</v>

185
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:39.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sources and all this,</v>

186
00:09:39.031 --> 00:09:43.890
<v Speaker 2>but apparently this stuff is being made</v>
<v Speaker 2>in China imported here and they use it</v>

187
00:09:43.891 --> 00:09:48.150
<v Speaker 2>to cut heroin because it's so strong</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people are dying left and right.</v>

188
00:09:48.740 --> 00:09:53.010
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of Carfentanil is far more,</v>

189
00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:58.110
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>far more toxic than heroin or even</v>

190
00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:59.400
<v Speaker 2>fentanyl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

191
00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:01.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're so,</v>

192
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is so much,</v>

193
00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.260
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much confusing and,</v>

194
00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:10.050
<v Speaker 2>and fuzzy thinking about the whole drug</v>
<v Speaker 2>issue,</v>

195
00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:11.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

196
00:10:11.881 --> 00:10:15.300
<v Speaker 2>as long as we're talking about opiates</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the moment,</v>

197
00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:17.670
<v Speaker 2>which is not really what I came in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about.</v>

198
00:10:17.671 --> 00:10:19.470
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

199
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:24.500
<v Speaker 2>you've heard of Kratom yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right now the DEA and the FDA.</v>

200
00:10:24.661 --> 00:10:27.270
<v Speaker 2>It's a plant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's used in Thailand.</v>

201
00:10:27.271 --> 00:10:30.060
<v Speaker 2>It is an OPA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt about it hits the</v>

202
00:10:30.061 --> 00:10:33.300
<v Speaker 2>opiate receptors and they want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>schedule it,</v>

203
00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:37.530
<v Speaker 2>but the problem is that in Thailand</v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional areas,</v>

204
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:42.590
<v Speaker 2>it's often used to get off of heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's potentially part of the</v>

205
00:10:43.441 --> 00:10:45.720
<v Speaker 2>solution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not part of the problem.</v>

206
00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:46.880
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

207
00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:51.890
<v Speaker 2>it's relatively easy to quit and the big</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing about Kratom it doesn't cause</v>

208
00:10:52.651 --> 00:10:57.150
<v Speaker 2>respiratory depression and respiratory</v>
<v Speaker 2>depression is what kills people from</v>

209
00:10:57.270 --> 00:10:59.370
<v Speaker 2>narco,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from heroin overdoses.</v>

210
00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:04.370
<v Speaker 2>It's the alkaloids and Metro Jina and do</v>
<v Speaker 2>not do that and Kratom is currently in</v>

211
00:11:05.311 --> 00:11:08.940
<v Speaker 2>those weird semi illegal states and this</v>
<v Speaker 2>semi legal state,</v>

212
00:11:08.941 --> 00:11:13.941
<v Speaker 2>but the DEA would love to schedule it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again they had plans to and there</v>

213
00:11:15.061 --> 00:11:18.450
<v Speaker 2>was some pushback about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people were saying things like,</v>

214
00:11:18.451 --> 00:11:19.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>

215
00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:24.630
<v Speaker 2>let's take a second look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This may be part of the solution because</v>

216
00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:29.250
<v Speaker 2>it could be a kind of a in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the herbal methadone.</v>

217
00:11:29.251 --> 00:11:32.250
<v Speaker 2>I mean Methadone's not the best way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but something that people could</v>

218
00:11:32.251 --> 00:11:37.251
<v Speaker 2>substitute and then gradually taper off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kratom has some weird sort of property.</v>

219
00:11:37.861 --> 00:11:40.530
<v Speaker 2>We're at low doses is a stimulant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

220
00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:43.320
<v Speaker 2>I've tried it before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but only at low doses I've had,</v>

221
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:45.190
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a company that sells it,</v>

222
00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.040
<v Speaker 2>that we have it right here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

223
00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:48.930
<v Speaker 2>there are lots of companies that sell</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

224
00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His company,</v>

225
00:11:50.671 --> 00:11:55.510
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>urban ice organics,</v>

226
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.070
<v Speaker 2>that's the name of the company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

227
00:11:57.071 --> 00:12:00.400
<v Speaker 2>but I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take two or three of those and it's</v>

228
00:12:00.401 --> 00:12:04.600
<v Speaker 2>like a cup of coffee and it's like no</v>
<v Speaker 2>weirdness.</v>

229
00:12:04.601 --> 00:12:08.230
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't feel high that at a low dose.</v>

230
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.510
<v Speaker 2>It is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is that a stimulant?</v>

231
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:13.210
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just unique pharmacology.</v>

232
00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:16.450
<v Speaker 2>How strange though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at higher doses it's a,</v>

233
00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:20.560
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely an OPA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And is it something that impairs motor</v>

234
00:12:20.561 --> 00:12:22.150
<v Speaker 2>skills?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

235
00:12:22.151 --> 00:12:23.800
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not so much.</v>

236
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:28.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean just in the sense that it's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>being high on morphine or heroin does.</v>

237
00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:31.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

238
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.730
<v Speaker 2>so it really can give you that kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>feeling.</v>

239
00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.380
<v Speaker 2>Absolute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

240
00:12:35.381 --> 00:12:36.910
<v Speaker 2>that's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

241
00:12:36.911 --> 00:12:40.660
<v Speaker 2>it hits the opiate receptors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then it also hits few other</v>

242
00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:44.950
<v Speaker 2>receptors as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is part of the stimulating effect.</v>

243
00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:50.310
<v Speaker 2>But you know why the pharmaceutical</v>
<v Speaker 2>companies are not all over this plan?</v>

244
00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:55.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand because for a long</v>
<v Speaker 2>time the holy grail and drug discovery</v>

245
00:12:56.351 --> 00:13:01.351
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to analgesics is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The narcotic that is not toxic,</v>

246
00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the analgesic that is not toxic,</v>

247
00:13:05.381 --> 00:13:08.950
<v Speaker 2>hopefully not addicting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not gonna happen.</v>

248
00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:12.190
<v Speaker 2>And is there an ld 50 for this stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Old Short.</v>

249
00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:17.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's an ld 50 for most things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For people in a lethal dose at 50</v>

250
00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:19.690
<v Speaker 2>percent it would be hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

251
00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:23.230
<v Speaker 2>the full dose for 50 percent of the size</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the sample.</v>

252
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:28.680
<v Speaker 2>But in the herbal form it would be hard</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get anywhere near a lethal dose.</v>

253
00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:33.530
<v Speaker 2>You have to giant brick of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably probably you throw up before he</v>

254
00:13:33.531 --> 00:13:35.200
<v Speaker 2>ever got to the league,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you,</v>

255
00:13:35.201 --> 00:13:40.201
<v Speaker 2>if you isolated one of the alkaloids,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven hydroxy metro is the strongest one</v>

256
00:13:41.151 --> 00:13:43.690
<v Speaker 2>that's about 100 times stronger than</v>
<v Speaker 2>morphine.</v>

257
00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.070
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

258
00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:46.450
<v Speaker 2>so definitely effect.</v>

259
00:13:46.780 --> 00:13:48.970
<v Speaker 2>So is there any issue with that stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

260
00:13:48.971 --> 00:13:52.570
<v Speaker 2>with people who have had problems with</v>
<v Speaker 2>pain pills in the past,</v>

261
00:13:52.571 --> 00:13:54.880
<v Speaker 2>maybe they start indulging this a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>bit too much and.</v>

262
00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:58.300
<v Speaker 2>Well it's a better alternative than the</v>
<v Speaker 2>pain pills.</v>

263
00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.750
<v Speaker 2>It's very good for people who want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get off that shit.</v>

264
00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:03.200
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I say that?</v>

265
00:14:03.930 --> 00:14:08.470
<v Speaker 2>This is the Internet want to get off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those kinds of things.</v>

266
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.710
<v Speaker 2>They don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can't quit cold Turkey,</v>

267
00:14:11.711 --> 00:14:16.711
<v Speaker 2>but they could go on Kratom and</v>
<v Speaker 2>gradually cut down because the</v>

268
00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:22.860
<v Speaker 2>withdrawal symptoms for Kratom or much</v>
<v Speaker 2>less apparently than for heroin and the</v>

269
00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.030
<v Speaker 2>and these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just don't grab you.</v>

270
00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:28.300
<v Speaker 2>So this is a gateway out of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>addiction,</v>

271
00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:32.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or they could even just maintain because</v>

272
00:14:32.231 --> 00:14:37.231
<v Speaker 2>it's not particularly dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous or impairs function or so and</v>

273
00:14:37.241 --> 00:14:38.680
<v Speaker 2>they could maintain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>

274
00:14:38.681 --> 00:14:41.980
<v Speaker 2>lots of people take heroin and managed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to maintain.</v>

275
00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:45.670
<v Speaker 2>Well I know a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not everyone can do that.</v>

276
00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:48.760
<v Speaker 2>They find some really good</v>
<v Speaker 2>anti-inflammation properties and this</v>

277
00:14:48.761 --> 00:14:50.710
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like people who exercise a lot,</v>

278
00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:51.950
<v Speaker 2>create them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

279
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wouldn't surprise me at all if that's</v>

280
00:14:54.471 --> 00:14:56.070
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

281
00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most plants have multiple effects.</v>

282
00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.210
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the differences between</v>
<v Speaker 2>plants and pharmaceuticals.</v>

283
00:15:02.690 --> 00:15:07.690
<v Speaker 2>Plants have families of molecules and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they often have complimentary tie kinds</v>

284
00:15:08.751 --> 00:15:10.060
<v Speaker 2>of activities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

285
00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:14.680
<v Speaker 2>so Kratom is one of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've known about it for awhile.</v>

286
00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:17.450
<v Speaker 2>It needs a lot more work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but potentially it's very,</v>

287
00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.630
<v Speaker 2>very interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

288
00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:24.440
<v Speaker 2>and of course the other one and in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of universe of,</v>

289
00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of OPA treatment is Ibogaine,</v>

290
00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:32.170
<v Speaker 2>which is not a completely different kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of thing I will gain is not itself a,</v>

291
00:15:32.361 --> 00:15:36.080
<v Speaker 2>an OPA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people use it to get off opiates</v>

292
00:15:36.081 --> 00:15:41.081
<v Speaker 2>because the experience is profound,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then it does something that a lot of</v>

293
00:15:44.271 --> 00:15:48.620
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics don't do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is it interrupts that craving for</v>

294
00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:53.680
<v Speaker 2>opiates depending on how it's structured</v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere from a few days to a few weeks.</v>

295
00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:59.420
<v Speaker 2>And the thing I think that determines</v>
<v Speaker 2>the effectiveness of,</v>

296
00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:04.510
<v Speaker 2>of Ibogaine as a treatment for opiates</v>
<v Speaker 2>is if the person has prepared for what</v>

297
00:16:04.761 --> 00:16:06.490
<v Speaker 2>happens afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

298
00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.750
<v Speaker 2>You got to prepare for what happens</v>
<v Speaker 2>after.</v>

299
00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.110
<v Speaker 2>If you go back to your old neighborhood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your old buddies,</v>

300
00:16:12.111 --> 00:16:14.220
<v Speaker 2>your old habits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not gonna work.</v>

301
00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:17.330
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not making a serious commitment</v>

302
00:16:17.331 --> 00:16:20.780
<v Speaker 2>to make it work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you have a plan going to go to</v>

303
00:16:20.781 --> 00:16:23.360
<v Speaker 2>this clinic at this treatment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get cleaned up,</v>

304
00:16:23.810 --> 00:16:25.400
<v Speaker 2>then what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

305
00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:28.550
<v Speaker 2>and that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's really.</v>

306
00:16:28.551 --> 00:16:33.530
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the main factor that</v>
<v Speaker 2>determines whether Ibogaine is effective</v>

307
00:16:33.531 --> 00:16:37.100
<v Speaker 2>or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it is for a lot of people it works.</v>

308
00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:39.380
<v Speaker 2>It's a problematic substance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

309
00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:43.520
<v Speaker 2>it's a controlled substance in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>states,</v>

310
00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:47.840
<v Speaker 2>but only in about six countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that actually prohibited?</v>

311
00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:50.840
<v Speaker 2>Most countries it's either in a gray</v>
<v Speaker 2>area,</v>

312
00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:53.660
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's a gray area.</v>

313
00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:57.420
<v Speaker 2>It's unregulated is the term couple of</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries,</v>

314
00:16:57.421 --> 00:17:00.570
<v Speaker 2>so put it on prescription drugs status,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

315
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:05.710
<v Speaker 2>Brazil and New Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's the framework is there.</v>

316
00:17:05.901 --> 00:17:09.860
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean there's a rush of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people to go to Ibogaine clinics in</v>

317
00:17:09.861 --> 00:17:13.730
<v Speaker 2>those countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really hasn't created a rush.</v>

318
00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:17.930
<v Speaker 2>But the framework is there of people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to want to do that.</v>

319
00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:22.960
<v Speaker 2>So I began this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another one of these that needs more</v>

320
00:17:23.301 --> 00:17:28.301
<v Speaker 2>investigation than is potentially part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the problem to the opiate epidemic.</v>

321
00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:31.270
<v Speaker 2>There is a rumor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will.</v>

322
00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:32.890
<v Speaker 2>They're more than rumors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

323
00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:35.660
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

324
00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:40.900
<v Speaker 2>Ibogaine activists are trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain states to provisionally approved</v>

325
00:17:42.741 --> 00:17:45.230
<v Speaker 2>the use of Ibogaine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

326
00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:47.960
<v Speaker 2>special lever from the federal</v>
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>

327
00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:51.510
<v Speaker 2>Fremont.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think New York has now applied for</v>

328
00:17:51.511 --> 00:17:55.800
<v Speaker 2>this because their problem is so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like basically they're saying to</v>

329
00:17:55.801 --> 00:17:58.920
<v Speaker 2>the government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's something that may work,</v>

330
00:17:59.250 --> 00:18:04.250
<v Speaker 2>just grant permission on the state side</v>
<v Speaker 2>statewide basis to have this medicine.</v>

331
00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:07.800
<v Speaker 2>We'll see where that goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

332
00:18:07.801 --> 00:18:08.970
<v Speaker 2>as you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you,</v>

333
00:18:10.810 --> 00:18:14.130
<v Speaker 2>I think we're all in this community</v>
<v Speaker 2>acutely aware of now.</v>

334
00:18:14.131 --> 00:18:19.131
<v Speaker 2>The government is again rumbling about</v>
<v Speaker 2>how they're going to revive the war on</v>

335
00:18:19.471 --> 00:18:20.310
<v Speaker 2>drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

336
00:18:20.311 --> 00:18:22.020
<v Speaker 2>it was a stupid idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The end of.</v>

337
00:18:22.021 --> 00:18:24.240
<v Speaker 2>It's even more stupid now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but hey,</v>

338
00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:29.300
<v Speaker 2>that's government did stupidity are us</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of their,</v>

339
00:18:29.881 --> 00:18:33.370
<v Speaker 2>their angle on things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this jeff sessions characters real</v>

340
00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.270
<v Speaker 2>see how it goes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not too worried because I think</v>

341
00:18:36.271 --> 00:18:38.670
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be so much pushback on</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

342
00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:40.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the other thing about trump.</v>

343
00:18:40.501 --> 00:18:44.370
<v Speaker 2>He seems to be a populist and if there</v>
<v Speaker 2>is too much pushback from that</v>

344
00:18:44.371 --> 00:18:46.350
<v Speaker 2>direction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think he's going to try to avoid that</v>

345
00:18:46.351 --> 00:18:51.180
<v Speaker 2>as much as possible when they did a</v>
<v Speaker 2>recent survey of the United States.</v>

346
00:18:51.181 --> 00:18:52.420
<v Speaker 2>And how many people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

347
00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:56.160
<v Speaker 2>think that marijuana should be legal</v>
<v Speaker 2>like recreationally legal.</v>

348
00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.820
<v Speaker 2>It's 60 percent now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is for the first time ever.</v>

349
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:03.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And states have done it and I just don't</v>

350
00:19:03.991 --> 00:19:05.730
<v Speaker 2>think you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

351
00:19:05.731 --> 00:19:08.220
<v Speaker 2>you can't go back to the war on drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

352
00:19:08.221 --> 00:19:10.770
<v Speaker 2>it was a miserable failure when it</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

353
00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:15.850
<v Speaker 2>There's no over 40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They pounded over a trillion dollars</v>

354
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.410
<v Speaker 2>down this rat hole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are more drugs,</v>

355
00:19:19.411 --> 00:19:22.710
<v Speaker 2>more kinds of drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>easier to get cheaper than ever.</v>

356
00:19:22.711 --> 00:19:26.550
<v Speaker 2>So where's the success and more people</v>
<v Speaker 2>in prison as a result of this.</v>

357
00:19:26.551 --> 00:19:30.210
<v Speaker 2>So where's the success drug?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing,</v>

358
00:19:30.211 --> 00:19:32.830
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing they can point to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not like anyone was saved.</v>

359
00:19:32.910 --> 00:19:33.743
<v Speaker 2>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

360
00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:36.910
<v Speaker 2>The problem is that these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

361
00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:39.630
<v Speaker 2>facts don't carry much weight with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

362
00:19:39.631 --> 00:19:44.631
<v Speaker 2>they're kind of off in their own private</v>
<v Speaker 2>ideological fantasy and uh,</v>

363
00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:47.370
<v Speaker 2>the fact that the war on drugs doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>work,</v>

364
00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:49.470
<v Speaker 2>doesn't matter to them.</v>

365
00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:52.560
<v Speaker 2>It's like these are bad people who need</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be punished.</v>

366
00:19:52.590 --> 00:19:55.140
<v Speaker 2>That's their,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their stance on it.</v>

367
00:19:55.141 --> 00:19:58.510
<v Speaker 2>It's not about anything other than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

368
00:19:58.530 --> 00:19:59.940
<v Speaker 2>I think that's really important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you just said.</v>

369
00:19:59.941 --> 00:20:02.700
<v Speaker 2>These are bad people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're really talking in these</v>

370
00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:04.920
<v Speaker 2>simplistic terms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the thing that session</v>

371
00:20:04.921 --> 00:20:08.820
<v Speaker 2>said that marijuana is not something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that good people use.</v>

372
00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:13.470
<v Speaker 2>Preposterous grandmas are out there that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are listening to this going,</v>

373
00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.460
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is this guy talking about</v>
<v Speaker 2>this?</v>

374
00:20:15.461 --> 00:20:16.650
<v Speaker 2>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

375
00:20:17.670 --> 00:20:19.470
<v Speaker 2>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's clear that,</v>

376
00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:24.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a jot of reflection or,</v>

377
00:20:24.840 --> 00:20:25.920
<v Speaker 2>or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

378
00:20:25.950 --> 00:20:29.640
<v Speaker 2>careful thought goes into these kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 2>statements.</v>

379
00:20:29.641 --> 00:20:31.710
<v Speaker 2>This is what bothers me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean many,</v>

380
00:20:31.711 --> 00:20:35.190
<v Speaker 2>many things bothered me about trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the chief things,</v>

381
00:20:35.191 --> 00:20:39.690
<v Speaker 2>one of the major,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess you could say flaws in his</v>

382
00:20:39.691 --> 00:20:43.390
<v Speaker 2>character among many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you listen to him talk,</v>

383
00:20:43.391 --> 00:20:47.410
<v Speaker 2>he listened to his general thing and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>realize this is not a man who's ever had</v>

384
00:20:47.411 --> 00:20:49.600
<v Speaker 2>a reflective thoughts in this life.</v>

385
00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:51.640
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no there,</v>

386
00:20:51.641 --> 00:20:53.710
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no inner self,</v>

387
00:20:53.711 --> 00:20:55.030
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

388
00:20:55.031 --> 00:20:56.030
<v Speaker 2>people say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

389
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:59.500
<v Speaker 2>just give that man some Iowasca and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>will straighten them out.</v>

390
00:20:59.501 --> 00:21:01.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's,</v>

391
00:21:01.091 --> 00:21:05.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there has to be something inside to</v>

392
00:21:05.111 --> 00:21:06.280
<v Speaker 2>straighten out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

393
00:21:06.281 --> 00:21:08.980
<v Speaker 2>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that maybe I would like to speak</v>

394
00:21:08.981 --> 00:21:11.410
<v Speaker 2>to him alone and find out who he really</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

395
00:21:11.411 --> 00:21:13.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think when someone's speaking in</v>

396
00:21:13.421 --> 00:21:15.010
<v Speaker 2>front of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

397
00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:18.350
<v Speaker 2>a big group of press or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>

398
00:21:18.351 --> 00:21:21.100
<v Speaker 2>anytime there's a camera on them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really hard to figure out who that</v>

399
00:21:21.101 --> 00:21:24.250
<v Speaker 2>person is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being alone with someone would be very</v>

400
00:21:24.251 --> 00:21:25.630
<v Speaker 2>illuminating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would.</v>

401
00:21:25.780 --> 00:21:28.870
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe alone he's different,</v>

402
00:21:28.871 --> 00:21:32.110
<v Speaker 2>but he is such a creature of media and</v>
<v Speaker 2>television.</v>

403
00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:33.820
<v Speaker 2>It's inexorable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

404
00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:37.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So maybe there is a thoughtful person</v>

405
00:21:37.541 --> 00:21:40.480
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I sure don't see any evidence of</v>

406
00:21:40.481 --> 00:21:41.120
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

407
00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:45.640
<v Speaker 2>And that's unfortunate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean because that's whatever you could</v>

408
00:21:45.641 --> 00:21:48.610
<v Speaker 2>say about Obama and there's many bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that,</v>

409
00:21:48.611 --> 00:21:50.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was not a perfect president.</v>

410
00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:55.680
<v Speaker 2>He was very thoughtful and smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

411
00:21:57.311 --> 00:22:01.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm not so sure trump is smart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's smart in a certain way,</v>

412
00:22:01.511 --> 00:22:06.511
<v Speaker 2>but not the way that we need our leaders</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be smart,</v>

413
00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:08.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this age we need to,</v>

414
00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:09.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyway,</v>

415
00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:13.900
<v Speaker 2>we could go on all day about this and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really what we wanted to.</v>

416
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:16.930
<v Speaker 2>We could go on about this all day and</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's definitely not.</v>

417
00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.690
<v Speaker 2>Let's instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's shift gears and talk about this</v>

418
00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:24.430
<v Speaker 2>celebration of 50 years of psychedelic</v>
<v Speaker 2>research and what you're doing now,</v>

419
00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:26.350
<v Speaker 2>and it's in Birmingham.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hazara is.</v>

420
00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:29.530
<v Speaker 2>It's in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in Buckinghamshire,</v>

421
00:22:30.070 --> 00:22:32.590
<v Speaker 2>England.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew it was a B.</v>

422
00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:34.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of those places.</v>

423
00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:38.980
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is something that I've wanted to do</v>

424
00:22:39.010 --> 00:22:40.090
<v Speaker 2>for a long time.</v>

425
00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:45.180
<v Speaker 2>And what the backstory is that in 1967</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was a conference that was</v>

426
00:22:47.171 --> 00:22:49.060
<v Speaker 2>sponsored,</v>
<v Speaker 2>believe it or not,</v>

427
00:22:49.061 --> 00:22:52.660
<v Speaker 2>by the health education and Welfare</v>
<v Speaker 2>Department of Health,</v>

428
00:22:52.661 --> 00:22:55.900
<v Speaker 2>education and Welfare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>National Institute of Mental Health,</v>

429
00:22:56.470 --> 00:23:01.470
<v Speaker 2>US government paid for this symposium</v>
<v Speaker 2>held in San Francisco in 1967 called the</v>

430
00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:06.640
<v Speaker 2>ethno pharmacologic search for</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychoactive drugs.</v>

431
00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:10.120
<v Speaker 2>And all the biggies were there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

432
00:23:10.121 --> 00:23:14.290
<v Speaker 2>Shogun was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Andrew Weil was there,</v>

433
00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:15.790
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shelties,</v>

434
00:23:15.791 --> 00:23:18.280
<v Speaker 2>of course he was probably the one that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

435
00:23:18.281 --> 00:23:22.660
<v Speaker 2>more or less around whom it coalesce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this was a chance for</v>

436
00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:27.400
<v Speaker 2>interdisciplinary people to come</v>
<v Speaker 2>together in a private conference and</v>

437
00:23:27.401 --> 00:23:29.740
<v Speaker 2>share knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was done.</v>

438
00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:34.480
<v Speaker 2>And they published this symposium volume</v>
<v Speaker 2>called Ethno pharmacologic search for</v>

439
00:23:34.481 --> 00:23:38.590
<v Speaker 2>psychoactive drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was us public health service</v>

440
00:23:38.650 --> 00:23:41.410
<v Speaker 2>publication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could get it from the US government</v>

441
00:23:41.411 --> 00:23:45.200
<v Speaker 2>printing office for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

442
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:50.180
<v Speaker 2>but the originally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea was that about every 10 years</v>

443
00:23:50.181 --> 00:23:52.400
<v Speaker 2>or so late,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how followup conferences,</v>

444
00:23:52.401 --> 00:23:52.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

445
00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:53.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>67,</v>

446
00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:59.210
<v Speaker 2>the war on drugs came along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The government became embarrassed that</v>

447
00:23:59.211 --> 00:24:03.650
<v Speaker 2>they had anything to do with this and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was never any followup conference.</v>

448
00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:08.680
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I though that book that came out was</v>

449
00:24:08.901 --> 00:24:12.920
<v Speaker 2>very influential to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was one of the big influences in my</v>

450
00:24:12.921 --> 00:24:17.921
<v Speaker 2>life as a 16 year old when I was just</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting interested in psychedelics.</v>

451
00:24:18.170 --> 00:24:23.150
<v Speaker 2>So for many years I've wanted to do a</v>
<v Speaker 2>followup conference.</v>

452
00:24:23.151 --> 00:24:26.960
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to do it on the 30th</v>
<v Speaker 2>anniversary back in [inaudible] 97,</v>

453
00:24:26.961 --> 00:24:31.760
<v Speaker 2>but it never came together to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this is the 50th anniversary.</v>

454
00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:33.080
<v Speaker 2>It's now or never.</v>

455
00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:40.120
<v Speaker 2>And so it's now apparently we are gonna</v>
<v Speaker 2>do this thing and uh,</v>

456
00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:45.110
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna be kind of much in the spirit</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the original conference.</v>

457
00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:48.440
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not going to keep it completely</v>

458
00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:49.940
<v Speaker 2>closed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

459
00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:53.840
<v Speaker 2>because we're not that kind of people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not much,</v>

460
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:58.280
<v Speaker 2>not a lot of room for people to actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>come to the place that's going to be,</v>

461
00:24:58.281 --> 00:25:00.680
<v Speaker 2>which is this place called tearing ham</v>
<v Speaker 2>hall.</v>

462
00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.330
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks exactly like Downton Abbey.</v>

463
00:25:05.331 --> 00:25:09.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a English country house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>beautiful place,</v>

464
00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:12.200
<v Speaker 2>but not a place set up for a huge</v>
<v Speaker 2>conference.</v>

465
00:25:12.201 --> 00:25:17.201
<v Speaker 2>They'll be maybe 10 guests stayed there</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a bunch of people staying close by,</v>

466
00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:20.720
<v Speaker 2>but the point is not so much the people</v>
<v Speaker 2>attending.</v>

467
00:25:20.721 --> 00:25:23.390
<v Speaker 2>It's going to be live streamed on</v>
<v Speaker 2>facebook,</v>

468
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:27.680
<v Speaker 2>which anyone can tune into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

469
00:25:27.770 --> 00:25:32.770
<v Speaker 2>then we're going to publish the</v>

474
00:25:48.621 --> 00:25:52.400
<v Speaker 2>one from this conference and we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll package them together as a</v>

<v Speaker 2>strategy for I'm getting the money to</v>
<v Speaker 2>pay for this thing and we're doing okay,</v>

477

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I give you the website,</v>

<v Speaker 2>fifty.com.</v>

479
00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:15.140
<v Speaker 2>What is done for ethno pharmacologic</v>
<v Speaker 2>search for psychoactive drugs,</v>

480
00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:20.320
<v Speaker 2>Fifty 50th anniversary.com.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's also a facebook page</v>

481
00:26:20.661 --> 00:26:23.180
<v Speaker 2>which were the live streaming is going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be.</v>

482
00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:26.720
<v Speaker 2>So if you go there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can order the book,</v>

485
00:26:34.790 --> 00:26:36.590
<v Speaker 2>that's what we're gonna do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we've,</v>

486
00:26:36.780 --> 00:26:38.030
<v Speaker 2>I've been very lucky.</v>

487
00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.080
<v Speaker 2>Have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

488
00:26:39.081 --> 00:26:42.890
<v Speaker 2>some people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know how these conferences are,</v>

489
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:47.400
<v Speaker 2>you don't do it on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I sort of floated this idea,</v>

490
00:26:47.401 --> 00:26:49.920
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people stepped up and said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

491
00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:52.170
<v Speaker 2>I want to be involved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All be involved,</v>

492
00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:55.440
<v Speaker 2>not only people that are helping</v>
<v Speaker 2>organizing it,</v>

493
00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:57.990
<v Speaker 2>but also people that are providing some</v>
<v Speaker 2>funding.</v>

494
00:26:57.991 --> 00:27:02.550
<v Speaker 2>So now we have the money to pay people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bringing them from all over the world.</v>

495
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.140
<v Speaker 2>There'll be about</v>
<v Speaker 2>18 presenters,</v>

496
00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:09.620
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

497
00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:12.960
<v Speaker 2>and some really good people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some very high profile people.</v>

498
00:27:12.961 --> 00:27:16.260
<v Speaker 2>David Nichols will be there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mark Plotkin,</v>

499
00:27:16.290 --> 00:27:21.290
<v Speaker 2>who runs the Amazon conservation team,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

500
00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:24.120
<v Speaker 2>a number of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

501
00:27:24.121 --> 00:27:28.770
<v Speaker 2>those are maybe the two highest profile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people that are known in the field</v>

502
00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:30.000
<v Speaker 2>and there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

503
00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:33.180
<v Speaker 2>you can look at the website [inaudible]</v>
<v Speaker 2>dot com.</v>

504
00:27:33.181 --> 00:27:37.350
<v Speaker 2>You can look at the program and if it</v>
<v Speaker 2>appeals to you,</v>

505
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:39.780
<v Speaker 2>get on the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

506
00:27:39.781 --> 00:27:42.180
<v Speaker 2>get on the live stream so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

507
00:27:42.210 --> 00:27:45.570
<v Speaker 2>those technologies did not exist in</v>
<v Speaker 2>1967.</v>

508
00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:48.660
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they do now.</v>

509
00:27:49.020 --> 00:27:52.050
<v Speaker 2>So why not let the world in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

510
00:27:52.051 --> 00:27:55.360
<v Speaker 2>we can't have everybody come to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Buckingham Shyer,</v>

511
00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:58.560
<v Speaker 2>but we can have them all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's the idea.</v>

512
00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure the response to this is going</v>

513
00:28:00.891 --> 00:28:04.050
<v Speaker 2>to be tremendous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can live stream it and live</v>

514
00:28:04.051 --> 00:28:06.000
<v Speaker 2>streaming on facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be huge.</v>

515
00:28:06.030 --> 00:28:07.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a great idea.</v>

516
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:09.610
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hope so.</v>

517
00:28:09.630 --> 00:28:12.630
<v Speaker 2>It is for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's an awesome use of the technology</v>

518
00:28:12.631 --> 00:28:16.520
<v Speaker 2>because there really isn't something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that that people can tune into and</v>

519
00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:21.740
<v Speaker 2>watch 18 different people speak and of</v>
<v Speaker 2>course it'll all be documented so it</v>

520
00:28:21.741 --> 00:28:25.080
<v Speaker 2>will be archived,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will generate a dvt out of it,</v>

521
00:28:25.650 --> 00:28:28.260
<v Speaker 2>but mainly it's the ball,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the books.</v>

522
00:28:28.261 --> 00:28:32.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean the idea of actually collecting</v>
<v Speaker 2>real physical books might seem like a</v>

523
00:28:32.971 --> 00:28:37.200
<v Speaker 2>quite 20th century idea to people and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

524
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:38.580
<v Speaker 2>we have to do it while you still can.</v>

525
00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:42.870
<v Speaker 2>I like the idea of having a nice box</v>
<v Speaker 2>set.</v>

526
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

527
00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:47.790
<v Speaker 2>people don't have to get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can get the single one.</v>

528
00:28:47.791 --> 00:28:52.110
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they're interested they could do it.</v>

529
00:28:52.890 --> 00:28:55.310
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

530
00:28:55.650 --> 00:29:00.510
<v Speaker 2>thanks for letting me come out and let</v>
<v Speaker 2>people know about this and tweeting it</v>

531
00:29:00.540 --> 00:29:02.070
<v Speaker 2>and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is all.</v>

532
00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:05.580
<v Speaker 2>This is all very helpful and it looks</v>
<v Speaker 2>like there's going to be a lot of</v>

533
00:29:05.581 --> 00:29:09.240
<v Speaker 2>response.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then of course the psychedelic</v>

534
00:29:09.241 --> 00:29:11.700
<v Speaker 2>science conferences coming up and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>

535
00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:17.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the symposium symposium guys there.</v>

536
00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:21.270
<v Speaker 2>They're running the stage at the maps</v>
<v Speaker 2>conference,</v>

537
00:29:21.271 --> 00:29:23.490
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a stage in the marketplace.</v>

538
00:29:23.491 --> 00:29:27.960
<v Speaker 2>So I'm going to be on there and they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>collaborating with us to on this</v>

539
00:29:27.961 --> 00:29:31.020
<v Speaker 2>project.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm pretty excited about it.</v>

540
00:29:31.170 --> 00:29:33.270
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do you organize the 18 different</v>

541
00:29:33.271 --> 00:29:37.170
<v Speaker 2>people that are talking and the subjects</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's no overlap and so that,</v>

542
00:29:37.270 --> 00:29:37.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

543
00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:40.410
<v Speaker 2>the message becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stays vibrant,</v>

544
00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:42.200
<v Speaker 2>will it?</v>

545
00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:44.220
<v Speaker 2>It hasn't really been a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

546
00:29:44.230 --> 00:29:45.560
<v Speaker 2>for one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

547
00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:50.320
<v Speaker 2>I pretty much knew who I wanted to come</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know what their specialty is.</v>

548
00:29:50.321 --> 00:29:54.730
<v Speaker 2>So I invited these people and they cover</v>
<v Speaker 2>a variety of specialties.</v>

549
00:29:54.731 --> 00:29:59.731
<v Speaker 2>So not really too much duplication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone brings something unique,</v>

550
00:30:01.001 --> 00:30:03.220
<v Speaker 2>their own perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

551
00:30:04.030 --> 00:30:06.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's,</v>

552
00:30:06.121 --> 00:30:07.930
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty easy really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

553
00:30:07.931 --> 00:30:12.931
<v Speaker 2>the idea of the ethno pharmacologic</v>
<v Speaker 2>search for psychoactive drugs is the</v>

554
00:30:13.811 --> 00:30:15.820
<v Speaker 2>apt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

555
00:30:15.821 --> 00:30:18.370
<v Speaker 2>we want it to focus on the frontier of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

556
00:30:18.371 --> 00:30:21.520
<v Speaker 2>This is still a very active area and we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't want,</v>

557
00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:24.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not another conference about Iowasca not</v>

558
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:25.663
<v Speaker 2>on the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

559
00:30:26.170 --> 00:30:28.660
<v Speaker 2>and that's all wonderful and I'm totally</v>
<v Speaker 2>behind it.</v>

560
00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:31.420
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>truth in advertising,</v>

561
00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:36.540
<v Speaker 2>we got four talks on Iowasca,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but different aspects of Iowasca that</v>

562
00:30:37.391 --> 00:30:40.540
<v Speaker 2>haven't really been discussed so much at</v>
<v Speaker 2>conferences.</v>

563
00:30:40.541 --> 00:30:43.900
<v Speaker 2>And then we have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we do have one gentleman talking about</v>

564
00:30:43.901 --> 00:30:45.820
<v Speaker 2>Kratom,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so these are things that we're not even</v>

577
00:31:22.391 --> 00:31:23.830
<v Speaker 2>on the radar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

578
00:31:23.831 --> 00:31:27.850
<v Speaker 2>in 1967.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's kind of the idea that there's</v>

579
00:31:27.851 --> 00:31:32.851
<v Speaker 2>been 50 years more work at a lot of work</v>
<v Speaker 2>and never any followup conferences.</v>

580
00:31:33.131 --> 00:31:37.510
<v Speaker 2>So that's the excuse for doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This will be the followup conference and</v>

581
00:31:37.511 --> 00:31:42.511
<v Speaker 2>if it gets momentum then maybe we'll be</v>
<v Speaker 2>able to do number three and number four.</v>

582
00:31:43.391 --> 00:31:45.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably by the time number four comes</v>

583
00:31:45.431 --> 00:31:48.100
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be drooling in my oatmeal,</v>

584
00:31:48.101 --> 00:31:52.640
<v Speaker 2>so I may not have much to do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be some new science.</v>

585
00:31:52.641 --> 00:31:54.250
<v Speaker 2>It's going to kick you right back into</v>
<v Speaker 2>gear.</v>

586
00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:56.490
<v Speaker 2>Let's hope so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot going on right now.</v>

587
00:31:56.491 --> 00:32:00.010
<v Speaker 2>Hold it on for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you're catching the wave at the</v>

588
00:32:00.011 --> 00:32:01.140
<v Speaker 2>right time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dennis.</v>

589
00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:05.170
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes I wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

590
00:32:06.170 --> 00:32:08.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm super positive for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

591
00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:11.980
<v Speaker 2>what is the status of Salvia Salvia</v>
<v Speaker 2>divinorum?</v>

592
00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:16.360
<v Speaker 2>What is the legal status?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Salvia divinorum is more or less legal</v>

593
00:32:16.361 --> 00:32:18.430
<v Speaker 2>on the federal level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still sold.</v>

594
00:32:18.431 --> 00:32:22.160
<v Speaker 2>I think a few states have banned it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

595
00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:25.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure which states how funny that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the opposite way,</v>

596
00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:28.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most things are federally illegal and</v>

597
00:32:28.001 --> 00:32:30.490
<v Speaker 2>then the states legalize them like</v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana at least,</v>

598
00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:34.810
<v Speaker 2>but salvias for people to know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Super Potent Psychedelic,</v>

599
00:32:34.811 --> 00:32:38.680
<v Speaker 2>super potent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I'm super bizarre,</v>

600
00:32:39.050 --> 00:32:42.650
<v Speaker 2>very weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think maybe that's kind of the</v>

601
00:32:42.651 --> 00:32:47.651
<v Speaker 2>built in a built in</v>
<v Speaker 2>protection against abuse because a lot</v>

602
00:32:49.311 --> 00:32:51.260
<v Speaker 2>of people don't care for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

603
00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:54.620
<v Speaker 2>it's like once isn't enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never again many pI.</v>

604
00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:58.280
<v Speaker 2>mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not something that you're likely</v>

605
00:32:58.281 --> 00:33:00.070
<v Speaker 2>to get addicted to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

606
00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:05.120
<v Speaker 2>unless you're just a very peculiar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's dysphoric,</v>

607
00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:08.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not pleasant.</v>

608
00:33:08.270 --> 00:33:11.570
<v Speaker 2>Most people find it quite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite unpleasant,</v>

609
00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:14.390
<v Speaker 2>even terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

610
00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:15.410
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>years back.</v>

611
00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.820
<v Speaker 2>But I think one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the,</v>

612
00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:19.700
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that protects against,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if people smoke it,</v>

613
00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:24.260
<v Speaker 2>which is not the traditional way at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

614
00:33:24.261 --> 00:33:28.340
<v Speaker 2>it's like it minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The traditional way is you choose a</v>

615
00:33:28.341 --> 00:33:33.341
<v Speaker 2>fresh leaves and it's the sage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's some variation of the sage plant,</v>

616
00:33:33.531 --> 00:33:34.341
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

617
00:33:34.341 --> 00:33:36.440
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is a sage or a mint.</v>

618
00:33:36.441 --> 00:33:39.620
<v Speaker 2>It's in the mint family and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called the sage,</v>

619
00:33:39.621 --> 00:33:42.230
<v Speaker 2>but it's really a mint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always wondered if there was some sort</v>

620
00:33:42.231 --> 00:33:44.900
<v Speaker 2>of correlation between the name's sage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning wisdom,</v>

621
00:33:44.901 --> 00:33:46.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then this stuff.</v>

622
00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:48.170
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just total bum luck.</v>

623
00:33:48.171 --> 00:33:50.420
<v Speaker 2>Some would like you to think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think.</v>

624
00:33:50.421 --> 00:33:53.960
<v Speaker 2>I think Daniel Siebert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's one of the specialists,</v>

625
00:33:53.961 --> 00:33:58.961
<v Speaker 2>he has a website called sage wisdom.org</v>
<v Speaker 2>or.com and good stuff.</v>

626
00:34:00.291 --> 00:34:01.760
<v Speaker 2>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's into Kratom.</v>

627
00:34:01.761 --> 00:34:03.410
<v Speaker 2>He provides,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

628
00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:05.930
<v Speaker 2>Salvia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He provides good information on it</v>

629
00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:08.150
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people,</v>

630
00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:11.900
<v Speaker 2>at least my own experience in many</v>
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

631
00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:13.220
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

632
00:34:13.221 --> 00:34:14.180
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting.</v>

633
00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:19.180
<v Speaker 2>It's profoundly strange.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what do you bring back from it?</v>

634
00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:21.500
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the question.</v>

635
00:34:21.501 --> 00:34:26.450
<v Speaker 2>What do you bring back from it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's partly why,</v>

636
00:34:27.410 --> 00:34:28.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people are,</v>

637
00:34:28.581 --> 00:34:30.770
<v Speaker 2>they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't seek it out.</v>

638
00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:34.910
<v Speaker 2>Particularly my friends are people that</v>
<v Speaker 2>do like it.</v>

639
00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:37.410
<v Speaker 2>I know a lot of people that do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

640
00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:39.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only did it once and I had this very</v>

641
00:34:39.711 --> 00:34:41.870
<v Speaker 2>bizarre out of body experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

642
00:34:41.871 --> 00:34:43.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I took enough.</v>

643
00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:44.570
<v Speaker 2>I had a friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ari,</v>

644
00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:48.410
<v Speaker 2>who took a lot who over the course of 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>minutes lived,</v>

645
00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:52.160
<v Speaker 2>maybe he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he believes in the neighborhood of five</v>

646
00:34:52.161 --> 00:34:57.161
<v Speaker 2>to six months and in this dimension</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you had a life and he had friends</v>

647
00:34:57.651 --> 00:35:02.651
<v Speaker 2>and he had a job and relationships and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he went through this and came back and</v>

648
00:35:05.091 --> 00:35:06.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 minutes later he's like,</v>

649
00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:08.960
<v Speaker 2>this is going to be impossible to</v>
<v Speaker 2>describe,</v>

650
00:35:08.990 --> 00:35:09.810
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

651
00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:14.810
<v Speaker 2>I lived a life I had like this</v>
<v Speaker 2>alternative reality that I went through</v>

652
00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:17.450
<v Speaker 2>for multiple months.</v>

653
00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:20.540
<v Speaker 2>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those kinds of experiences,</v>

654
00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:23.720
<v Speaker 2>believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are not that uncommon mountain Salvia,</v>

655
00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:28.790
<v Speaker 2>somebody told me once they had the</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience where you know they were in a</v>

656
00:35:28.791 --> 00:35:32.630
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were like seven or eight years old.</v>

657
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:35.870
<v Speaker 2>It was Christmas morning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were at the Christmas trees</v>

658
00:35:35.871 --> 00:35:39.990
<v Speaker 2>celebrating Christmas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>opening the presents with a family that</v>

659
00:35:39.991 --> 00:35:44.991
<v Speaker 2>this guy had no connection to the team</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>

660
00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:47.460
<v Speaker 2>what do you make of that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

661
00:35:47.461 --> 00:35:51.540
<v Speaker 2>I think Salvia is interesting in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that regard,</v>

662
00:35:51.541 --> 00:35:52.260
<v Speaker 2>in that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

663
00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:55.270
<v Speaker 2>some of these ones that</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

664
00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:57.600
<v Speaker 2>they're worth exploring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

665
00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:01.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you can distort time or</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually go into,</v>

666
00:36:01.590 --> 00:36:04.230
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>parallel dimensions or whatever that's</v>

667
00:36:04.231 --> 00:36:07.350
<v Speaker 2>looking into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it takes more intrepid</v>

668
00:36:07.351 --> 00:36:11.490
<v Speaker 2>psychonauts than I am to look into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I would encourage people to</v>

669
00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.950
<v Speaker 2>carefully explore this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

670
00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:19.040
<v Speaker 2>years ago when I first explored DMT,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could get five Meo dmt online.</v>

671
00:36:21.210 --> 00:36:24.810
<v Speaker 2>There was a chemical company you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>buy it and I bought like a,</v>

672
00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:29.130
<v Speaker 2>like a jug of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a container of it,</v>

673
00:36:29.160 --> 00:36:34.160
<v Speaker 2>like the size of this Stevia container,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is for people don't know enough to</v>

674
00:36:34.441 --> 00:36:39.420
<v Speaker 2>get high for the rest of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>DMT once a month for the rest of you and</v>

675
00:36:39.421 --> 00:36:40.770
<v Speaker 2>that's all you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

676
00:36:40.771 --> 00:36:45.771
<v Speaker 2>especially five meo five meo brings you</v>
<v Speaker 2>to someplace that feels like the</v>

677
00:36:46.861 --> 00:36:51.570
<v Speaker 2>ultimate center of the universe and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing and it's you.</v>

678
00:36:51.571 --> 00:36:53.300
<v Speaker 2>You're a part of the whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

679
00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:55.650
<v Speaker 2>it's also no visuals which is really</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird.</v>

680
00:36:55.651 --> 00:37:00.330
<v Speaker 2>Or if it is a visual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like these opaque geometric</v>

681
00:37:00.331 --> 00:37:05.331
<v Speaker 2>patterns that exist in this bizarre</v>
<v Speaker 2>white and you just cease to exist and it</v>

682
00:37:05.581 --> 00:37:09.570
<v Speaker 2>feels terrifying and strange and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

683
00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:11.760
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no accounting for taste.</v>

684
00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.020
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

685
00:37:13.140 --> 00:37:17.430
<v Speaker 2>It is like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are no visuals so that's something</v>

686
00:37:17.431 --> 00:37:22.431
<v Speaker 2>strange about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but many people feel like if it puts you</v>

687
00:37:22.831 --> 00:37:25.860
<v Speaker 2>in this void place or the zero energy</v>
<v Speaker 2>point.</v>

688
00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:28.230
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've had James Orac on</v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

689
00:37:28.231 --> 00:37:31.110
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wrote the book tryptamine palace.</v>

690
00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:35.350
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is all about five methoxy dmt with</v>

691
00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:36.960
<v Speaker 2>how do you spell his last name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

692
00:37:37.070 --> 00:37:40.110
<v Speaker 2>Orac,</v>
<v Speaker 2>O r o c k,</v>

693
00:37:40.111 --> 00:37:43.650
<v Speaker 2>I think the name of his book is</v>
<v Speaker 2>tryptamine palace.</v>

694
00:37:45.390 --> 00:37:46.320
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

695
00:37:46.350 --> 00:37:50.590
<v Speaker 2>his thing is five methoxy and has thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

696
00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:53.280
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

697
00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:55.200
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's an interesting book.</v>

698
00:37:55.230 --> 00:37:58.360
<v Speaker 2>And now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Sonoran towed,</v>

699
00:37:58.370 --> 00:37:59.380
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've heard that.</v>

700
00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:04.910
<v Speaker 2>That's five methoxy toad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You excrete something on like glass,</v>

701
00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:10.320
<v Speaker 2>you excrete the venom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you actually have to torture the toad a</v>

702
00:38:10.321 --> 00:38:11.840
<v Speaker 2>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

703
00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:15.090
<v Speaker 2>or squeeze the venom which is in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>parotid glands.</v>

704
00:38:15.091 --> 00:38:19.170
<v Speaker 2>You squeeze it out on a slide,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dry it out,</v>

705
00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:24.230
<v Speaker 2>and then you can smoke it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's about 11 to 15 percent,</v>

706
00:38:24.631 --> 00:38:26.080
<v Speaker 2>five mil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>

707
00:38:26.490 --> 00:38:30.570
<v Speaker 2>it's a heavy hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do they know why this toad produces this</v>

708
00:38:30.571 --> 00:38:31.140
<v Speaker 2>in venom?</v>

709
00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:34.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it psychoactive when you eat it low?</v>

710
00:38:34.081 --> 00:38:35.500
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

711
00:38:35.501 --> 00:38:40.501
<v Speaker 2>Most tolds</v>
<v Speaker 2>produced [inaudible],</v>

712
00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:43.660
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is very close to five methoxy it.</v>

713
00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:48.880
<v Speaker 2>And in fact it's named after the toads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That genus of toads is Bufo,</v>

714
00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:51.280
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] is found in most of these</v>

715
00:38:51.281 --> 00:38:56.281
<v Speaker 2>toads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but bufo our various is the only species</v>

716
00:38:57.341 --> 00:39:01.360
<v Speaker 2>known that contains five methoxy DMT.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's got this Molech,</v>

717
00:39:01.450 --> 00:39:04.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a probably single gene mutation</v>

718
00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:07.990
<v Speaker 2>that lets it produced this methoxy</v>
<v Speaker 2>related,</v>

719
00:39:08.050 --> 00:39:11.500
<v Speaker 2>a compound which is much stronger than</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] name.</v>

720
00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:14.590
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>

721
00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:19.620
<v Speaker 2>just to caution people sometimes in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>media you hear about people are licking</v>

722
00:39:19.811 --> 00:39:21.340
<v Speaker 2>toads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not going to do it.</v>

723
00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.410
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not liquid and toads,</v>

724
00:39:23.700 --> 00:39:27.410
<v Speaker 2>they're smoking isn't aware that it just</v>
<v Speaker 2>gets,</v>

725
00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:31.660
<v Speaker 2>tend to lick him because they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're nasty things that will be,</v>

726
00:39:31.870 --> 00:39:34.440
<v Speaker 2>that will kill you if you look at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>pie,</v>

727
00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:35.380
<v Speaker 2>realized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

728
00:39:35.381 --> 00:39:37.840
<v Speaker 2>these cardiac glycosides Oh God.</v>

729
00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:42.460
<v Speaker 2>But pirate realizing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>burning it destroys all those things so</v>

730
00:39:42.461 --> 00:39:43.160
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

731
00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:46.660
<v Speaker 2>that it's okay to smoke it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's definitely a dangerous tool.</v>

732
00:39:46.661 --> 00:39:50.710
<v Speaker 2>Lick it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people don't like licking toads</v>

733
00:39:50.711 --> 00:39:52.630
<v Speaker 2>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably.</v>

734
00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:53.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That</v>

735
00:39:55.480 --> 00:40:00.480
<v Speaker 2>various fairy tales is that the human</v>
<v Speaker 2>body produced five Meo DMT as well.</v>

736
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:03.470
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

737
00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:07.180
<v Speaker 2>And is it produced in the same area?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the liver and the lungs and</v>

738
00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:10.120
<v Speaker 2>presumably the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pineal gland,</v>

739
00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:11.710
<v Speaker 2>all of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

740
00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:14.200
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes it does.</v>

741
00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:19.260
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of controversy about</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether,</v>

742
00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:23.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these endogenous tryptamines dmt</v>

743
00:40:23.171 --> 00:40:26.680
<v Speaker 2>primarily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but five vimeo is definitely there as</v>

744
00:40:26.681 --> 00:40:28.810
<v Speaker 2>well until they have a function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

745
00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:33.900
<v Speaker 2>there is a lot of speculation and not a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of facts about whether they actually</v>

746
00:40:34.781 --> 00:40:37.210
<v Speaker 2>have a function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

747
00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:38.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

748
00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.090
<v Speaker 2>they're made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

749
00:40:41.440 --> 00:40:42.220
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

750
00:40:42.220 --> 00:40:44.290
<v Speaker 2>there's one school of thought that says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

751
00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:47.110
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're sorta like physiological noise,</v>

752
00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:49.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll never reach a point where you</v>

753
00:40:49.481 --> 00:40:54.070
<v Speaker 2>could actually perceive any effect</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the enzymes,</v>

754
00:40:54.100 --> 00:40:56.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think kind of secular insight.</v>

755
00:40:56.350 --> 00:41:01.330
<v Speaker 2>We'll just chop up dmt very readily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so close to human metabolism.</v>

756
00:41:01.331 --> 00:41:04.090
<v Speaker 2>It's not gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna be very ephemeral in the</v>

757
00:41:04.091 --> 00:41:06.280
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it is released,</v>

758
00:41:07.450 --> 00:41:12.450
<v Speaker 2>but other people maintain that under</v>
<v Speaker 2>some circumstances the DMT can be stored</v>

759
00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:17.670
<v Speaker 2>in vesicles and neuro vesicles and</v>
<v Speaker 2>released on demand or when some stimulus</v>

760
00:41:19.570 --> 00:41:24.570
<v Speaker 2>leads to its release like stress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some stress of some sort will go out and</v>

761
00:41:24.971 --> 00:41:29.560
<v Speaker 2>grab that painting that that young guy</v>
<v Speaker 2>sent the guy who has a pineal gland</v>

762
00:41:29.561 --> 00:41:32.690
<v Speaker 2>tumor who makes this really crazy trip</v>
<v Speaker 2>to mean art.</v>

763
00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:33.993
<v Speaker 2>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've</v>

764
00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:37.670
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy sent me one of his pieces and</v>

765
00:41:37.671 --> 00:41:38.600
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

766
00:41:38.601 --> 00:41:40.430
<v Speaker 1>he has a tumor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know his name?</v>

767
00:41:40.431 --> 00:41:42.710
<v Speaker 1>Jamie will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll find his name.</v>

768
00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:46.100
<v Speaker 1>I'll give this guy some some love,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he,</v>

769
00:41:46.370 --> 00:41:49.310
<v Speaker 1>he look at his artwork and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

770
00:41:49.311 --> 00:41:50.710
<v Speaker 1>that's what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

771
00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:55.320
<v Speaker 1>almost like Alex grey stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Alex Gray stuff is a,</v>

772
00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:56.810
<v Speaker 1>it's art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

773
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:59.390
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely representative of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>tryptamine world.</v>

774
00:41:59.391 --> 00:42:01.760
<v Speaker 1>It's beautiful and fantastic and</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

775
00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:02.870
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's art.</v>

776
00:42:03.260 --> 00:42:08.260
<v Speaker 1>This guy's stuff seems like a trip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it gets the chaos of the tryptamine</v>

777
00:42:08.961 --> 00:42:11.570
<v Speaker 1>experience is sort of replicated in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>artwork.</v>

778
00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:12.793
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

779
00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:15.470
<v Speaker 1>And so this young guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we'll find out his name,</v>

780
00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:16.730
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

781
00:42:16.731 --> 00:42:17.870
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sent this.</v>

782
00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:21.830
<v Speaker 1>I first heard of have this gentleman</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the.</v>

783
00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:24.590
<v Speaker 1>Holy Moly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a look at this.</v>

784
00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:27.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I first heard of this guy from John.</v>

785
00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:27.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hiya.</v>

786
00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:29.540
<v Speaker 1>Who organized this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alex?</v>

787
00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:34.160
<v Speaker 1>A up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there is enough.</v>

788
00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:39.680
<v Speaker 1>So I think this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a zero gravity environment.</v>

789
00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:43.730
<v Speaker 1>Any way that you want it to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is pretty amazing.</v>

790
00:42:43.770 --> 00:42:45.470
<v Speaker 1>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

791
00:42:45.530 --> 00:42:46.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

792
00:42:46.191 --> 00:42:49.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm waiting for the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're building a new studio and when</v>

793
00:42:49.191 --> 00:42:51.800
<v Speaker 1>that's done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll have this up prominently featured,</v>

794
00:42:51.801 --> 00:42:54.290
<v Speaker 1>but this kid's work is just incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie,</v>

795
00:42:54.291 --> 00:42:56.030
<v Speaker 1>see if you could find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who He is,</v>

796
00:42:56.031 --> 00:42:57.980
<v Speaker 1>but he should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is He?</v>

797
00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:03.020
<v Speaker 1>I hope he's healthy letting himself be</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at by medical people.</v>

798
00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:04.760
<v Speaker 1>I think he's just happy to be tripping</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

799
00:43:05.010 --> 00:43:10.010
<v Speaker 1>This is going to leave about science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sean Thornton.</v>

800
00:43:11.150 --> 00:43:12.710
<v Speaker 1>Shout out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shout out to Sean Thornton.</v>

801
00:43:12.711 --> 00:43:13.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this work there.</v>

802
00:43:13.671 --> 00:43:14.960
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Artists got cancer.</v>

803
00:43:14.961 --> 00:43:17.000
<v Speaker 1>The pineal gland is paintings will leave</v>
<v Speaker 1>you speechless.</v>

804
00:43:17.001 --> 00:43:18.620
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

809
00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:30.170
<v Speaker 1>he's in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in some sort of way,</v>

810
00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:33.140
<v Speaker 1>anecdotal evidence that it's produced in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pineal gland.</v>

811
00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:35.750
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Cottonwood Research Foundation that</v>

812
00:43:35.751 --> 00:43:39.650
<v Speaker 1>Dr Rick Strassman is a part of in his</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing work from DMT,</v>

813
00:43:39.651 --> 00:43:40.670
<v Speaker 1>the spirit molecule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

814
00:43:40.671 --> 00:43:43.460
<v Speaker 1>the documentary that you and I were in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his,</v>

815
00:43:43.461 --> 00:43:46.090
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his work has shown that it's a,</v>

816
00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:49.160
<v Speaker 1>it is produced by the pineal gland in</v>
<v Speaker 1>live rats.</v>

817
00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:53.030
<v Speaker 1>So we know now for a fact that at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that mammal,</v>

818
00:43:53.090 --> 00:43:54.860
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's produced in the pineal gland,</v>

819
00:43:54.861 --> 00:43:57.500
<v Speaker 1>but that's always been for people that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

820
00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:00.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went to the Vatican last summer and</v>

821
00:44:00.501 --> 00:44:02.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the really cool things was the</v>

822
00:44:02.910 --> 00:44:07.910
<v Speaker 1>giant pine cone that they have in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>center of one of the outer areas.</v>

823
00:44:09.950 --> 00:44:14.950
<v Speaker 1>And I was really lucky to have a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>good guide who is a professor.</v>

824
00:44:15.500 --> 00:44:19.700
<v Speaker 1>And he was explaining to me that that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was representative of the pineal gland.</v>

825
00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:21.460
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

826
00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:25.640
<v Speaker 1>it was really fascinating because</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this enormous pine cone and it's</v>

827
00:44:25.641 --> 00:44:29.510
<v Speaker 1>surrounded by these two peacocks are two</v>
<v Speaker 1>peacocks on the side there where they're</v>

828
00:44:29.511 --> 00:44:32.130
<v Speaker 1>supposed to represent a mortality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a strange way.</v>

829
00:44:32.490 --> 00:44:35.820
<v Speaker 1>So I don't know what that whole vision</v>
<v Speaker 1>was supposed to mean,</v>

830
00:44:35.821 --> 00:44:38.230
<v Speaker 1>but he was very adamant that that pine</v>
<v Speaker 1>cone there,</v>

831
00:44:38.231 --> 00:44:42.420
<v Speaker 1>you see it up there on the screen that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is representative of the pineal</v>

832
00:44:42.421 --> 00:44:47.280
<v Speaker 1>gland and also in ancient Egypt and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of the hieroglyphs you see that as</v>

833
00:44:47.281 --> 00:44:48.120
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

834
00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:49.321
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

835
00:44:49.321 --> 00:44:52.890
<v Speaker 1>pineal itself means because it is shaped</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a pine cone.</v>

836
00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:55.860
<v Speaker 1>That's why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why it's named that.</v>

837
00:44:55.861 --> 00:44:58.620
<v Speaker 1>But I have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is very interesting.</v>

838
00:44:58.650 --> 00:44:59.640
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was pretty fascinating.</v>

839
00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:03.420
<v Speaker 1>What was also fascinating was this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although he knew that that was</v>

840
00:45:03.421 --> 00:45:06.900
<v Speaker 1>representative of the pineal gland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did not know that the pineal pineal</v>

841
00:45:06.901 --> 00:45:09.810
<v Speaker 1>gland produce dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't even aware of what the EMT</v>

842
00:45:09.811 --> 00:45:10.644
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

843
00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:13.800
<v Speaker 1>So he and I had this really cool</v>
<v Speaker 1>conversation about it where it was like,</v>

844
00:45:13.850 --> 00:45:17.340
<v Speaker 1>what know this crazy Italian accent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is amazing.</v>

845
00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:21.570
<v Speaker 1>And he's writing things down and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing to telling him about strassman's</v>

846
00:45:21.571 --> 00:45:24.960
<v Speaker 1>work and you and your brother and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these different things to look into and</v>

847
00:45:25.450 --> 00:45:26.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a.</v>

848
00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.070
<v Speaker 1>my wife was rolling her eyes like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh Jesus,</v>

849
00:45:29.071 --> 00:45:29.970
<v Speaker 1>not this shit again.</v>

850
00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:35.580
<v Speaker 1>You just have happy taken out in public</v>
<v Speaker 1>joe.</v>

851
00:45:35.581 --> 00:45:40.080
<v Speaker 1>You always embarrassed when she just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She knew as soon as the guy said,</v>

852
00:45:40.081 --> 00:45:42.150
<v Speaker 1>pineal gland in my eyes lit up and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

853
00:45:42.151 --> 00:45:44.520
<v Speaker 1>here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about drugs.</v>

854
00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:50.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a guy,</v>

855
00:45:50.130 --> 00:45:55.080
<v Speaker 1>a couple of interesting people have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>mention in this context.</v>

856
00:45:55.081 --> 00:45:57.640
<v Speaker 1>One of them is a researcher</v>

857
00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:00.330
<v Speaker 2>guy named Ed Frick.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ska Ska.</v>

858
00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:02.860
<v Speaker 2>How do you spell that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good question.</v>

859
00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:09.090
<v Speaker 2>Ed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>F R e e C K S K,</v>

860
00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:14.200
<v Speaker 2>I think I may have to correct myself on</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

861
00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:17.320
<v Speaker 2>He's a pharmacologist and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>neurochemical,</v>

862
00:46:17.321 --> 00:46:22.321
<v Speaker 2>neuro chemist and psychiatrist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he is the one that's really kind of</v>

863
00:46:23.081 --> 00:46:28.081
<v Speaker 2>leading the charge for endogenous</v>
<v Speaker 2>functions of DMT and has good evidence</v>

864
00:46:29.410 --> 00:46:31.810
<v Speaker 2>which has been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

865
00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:34.900
<v Speaker 2>disputed by some.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Dave Nichols is kind of on the</v>

866
00:46:34.901 --> 00:46:36.190
<v Speaker 2>other side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

867
00:46:36.191 --> 00:46:36.970
<v Speaker 2>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dmt.</v>

868
00:46:36.970 --> 00:46:40.120
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have any internal function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these people are diluted,</v>

869
00:46:40.570 --> 00:46:43.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seems to me to be really cocky too.</v>

870
00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:46.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's surprising that Dave</v>

871
00:46:46.990 --> 00:46:51.160
<v Speaker 2>who's a very careful scientist would</v>
<v Speaker 2>have such,</v>

872
00:46:51.350 --> 00:46:54.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>such pre formed ideas,</v>

873
00:46:54.140 --> 00:46:55.640
<v Speaker 2>very rigid idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

874
00:46:56.110 --> 00:47:00.640
<v Speaker 2>There's a conference in the UK at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>end of June called breaking convention,</v>

875
00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:02.560
<v Speaker 2>which you may have heard of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a big.</v>

876
00:47:02.650 --> 00:47:07.390
<v Speaker 2>It's like a psychedelic conference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dave and the Ed are going to be there.</v>

877
00:47:07.391 --> 00:47:09.740
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully keeping them up.</v>

878
00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:10.743
<v Speaker 2>I don't want any.</v>

879
00:47:13.290 --> 00:47:16.780
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be talking about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>and doing into Beta on it.</v>

880
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:19.640
<v Speaker 1>Breaking Convention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might tell people to Google that.</v>

881
00:47:19.641 --> 00:47:21.770
<v Speaker 1>That's very interesting conference for</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>

882
00:47:21.771 --> 00:47:26.060
<v Speaker 1>What makes Dave so confident?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean when you consider the potency of</v>

883
00:47:26.061 --> 00:47:30.070
<v Speaker 1>it and the knowledge that that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>produced in the body and then also the</v>

884
00:47:30.071 --> 00:47:32.590
<v Speaker 1>knowledge of the effects of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are just astounding.</v>

885
00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:35.020
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could anyone say that you know for</v>

886
00:47:35.021 --> 00:47:37.190
<v Speaker 1>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does he done it as David?</v>

887
00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:40.570
<v Speaker 1>Of course he's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could he do it and not go?</v>

888
00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:41.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>

889
00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:43.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he does,</v>

890
00:47:43.391 --> 00:47:47.110
<v Speaker 1>but then there's also this very</v>
<v Speaker 1>reductionist side to him.</v>

891
00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:52.270
<v Speaker 1>Then basically just as a pharmacologist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says it's never going to reach,</v>

892
00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:56.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sufficient concentration in the plasma</v>

893
00:47:56.801 --> 00:47:58.420
<v Speaker 1>to have an effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

894
00:47:58.421 --> 00:48:01.210
<v Speaker 1>I think he's wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I told him,</v>

895
00:48:01.211 --> 00:48:02.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was teasing him,</v>

896
00:48:02.501 --> 00:48:03.790
<v Speaker 1>I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

897
00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:05.020
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wrote back,</v>

898
00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:07.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that famous phrase,</v>

899
00:48:07.721 --> 00:48:11.290
<v Speaker 1>the Arthur c dot Clark once said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

900
00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:13.990
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when a distinguished but elderly</v>

901
00:48:13.991 --> 00:48:16.720
<v Speaker 1>scientists says that something is</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible,</v>

902
00:48:17.170 --> 00:48:21.490
<v Speaker 1>he's very likely correct when he says</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's impossible.</v>

903
00:48:21.491 --> 00:48:23.110
<v Speaker 1>He's almost certainly wrong.</v>

904
00:48:25.990 --> 00:48:27.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're talking about that,</v>

905
00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:31.990
<v Speaker 1>just general bio diversity of human</v>
<v Speaker 1>beings and how some people.</v>

906
00:48:32.270 --> 00:48:34.360
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about other human</v>
<v Speaker 1>neurochemistry,</v>

907
00:48:34.361 --> 00:48:35.620
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like depression,</v>

908
00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:39.070
<v Speaker 1>like some people are super happy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>have no problem with their dope,</v>

909
00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:40.780
<v Speaker 1>meaner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>serotonin levels and there's other</v>

910
00:48:40.781 --> 00:48:43.750
<v Speaker 1>people that have real issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

911
00:48:43.780 --> 00:48:45.340
<v Speaker 1>Well there is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

912
00:48:45.341 --> 00:48:48.490
<v Speaker 1>So just look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the variability of that,</v>

913
00:48:48.491 --> 00:48:51.910
<v Speaker 1>and then also how that can be</v>
<v Speaker 1>manipulated with exercise and all these</v>

914
00:48:51.911 --> 00:48:53.800
<v Speaker 1>other different things that can raise</v>
<v Speaker 1>those levels up.</v>

915
00:48:54.310 --> 00:48:57.790
<v Speaker 1>What about the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in terms of like holotropic</v>

916
00:48:57.791 --> 00:49:01.980
<v Speaker 1>breathing or all these different</v>
<v Speaker 1>shamonic breathing and yoga exercises?</v>

917
00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:03.550
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kundalini Yoga,</v>

918
00:49:03.551 --> 00:49:06.030
<v Speaker 1>which I haven't experienced it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't let Jonah,</v>

919
00:49:06.040 --> 00:49:10.900
<v Speaker 1>but I did have a very bizarre experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly recently on yoga where I went</v>

920
00:49:10.901 --> 00:49:15.901
<v Speaker 1>into class on a pretty pretty high dose</v>
<v Speaker 1>of cannabis and I started tripping in</v>

921
00:49:16.511 --> 00:49:19.510
<v Speaker 1>the middle of one of the more intense</v>
<v Speaker 1>poses.</v>

922
00:49:19.930 --> 00:49:24.930
<v Speaker 1>It was just something akin to the very</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginnings of a dmt trip where I started</v>

923
00:49:26.531 --> 00:49:30.040
<v Speaker 1>seeing patterns and seeing things moving</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some sort of a.</v>

924
00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:34.530
<v Speaker 1>It didn't go anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't pursue it in terms of</v>

925
00:49:34.750 --> 00:49:38.920
<v Speaker 1>attempting to make that happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would imagine that if it's made in</v>

926
00:49:38.921 --> 00:49:40.580
<v Speaker 1>the body and then the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

927
00:49:40.930 --> 00:49:43.930
<v Speaker 1>the effects of it are reproducible when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take it.</v>

928
00:49:44.090 --> 00:49:49.090
<v Speaker 1>I mean taking dmt is a very few people</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a very small percentage that don't</v>

929
00:49:49.661 --> 00:49:51.220
<v Speaker 1>have an experience when they take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

930
00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:55.630
<v Speaker 1>Very small percentage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do we know what that number is?</v>

931
00:49:56.320 --> 00:50:01.090
<v Speaker 1>Probably something like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I would say a wild guess,</v>

932
00:50:01.091 --> 00:50:05.320
<v Speaker 1>but a two percent or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>anomalous.</v>

933
00:50:05.350 --> 00:50:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Why should there be people who don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have any effect?</v>

934
00:50:09.311 --> 00:50:11.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a whole other question about</v>

935
00:50:11.411 --> 00:50:16.090
<v Speaker 1>what's strange about their metabolism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's interesting that you raise this</v>

936
00:50:16.091 --> 00:50:19.930
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of these yoga techniques,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially Kundalini,</v>

937
00:50:19.931 --> 00:50:24.931
<v Speaker 1>is probably about inducing dmt synthesis</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the pineal or wherever it occurs.</v>

938
00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 1>There's also a very</v>

939
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:31.370
<v Speaker 2>interesting technology that has come to</v>
<v Speaker 2>light.</v>

940
00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:35.360
<v Speaker 2>I just found out about it last summer</v>
<v Speaker 2>called the adage know light.</v>

941
00:50:35.450 --> 00:50:38.840
<v Speaker 2>Have you heard of this age?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A J.</v>

942
00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:42.380
<v Speaker 2>A N a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So write down on the light.com.</v>

943
00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:46.280
<v Speaker 2>The Sky who's developed this very</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting fellow.</v>

944
00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:51.910
<v Speaker 2>He's named a guy heroin and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he used to work for apple.</v>

945
00:50:53.391 --> 00:50:57.740
<v Speaker 2>He actually worked very closely with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steve Jobs when Steve Jobs had next</v>

946
00:50:57.770 --> 00:51:01.100
<v Speaker 2>computing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he's basically a computer programmer</v>

947
00:51:01.101 --> 00:51:04.670
<v Speaker 2>and the engineer worked with Steve Jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then he,</v>

948
00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:09.700
<v Speaker 2>for some reason he decided he had to</v>
<v Speaker 2>move to Thailand and become a zen monk,</v>

949
00:51:10.310 --> 00:51:13.760
<v Speaker 2>which he did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he continued to work with technology</v>

950
00:51:13.761 --> 00:51:16.490
<v Speaker 2>and he developed this thing called the</v>
<v Speaker 2>original light,</v>

951
00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:21.670
<v Speaker 2>which he claims induces dmt synthesis in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the pineal.</v>

952
00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:26.300
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at a conference last summer</v>

953
00:51:26.330 --> 00:51:30.350
<v Speaker 2>actually tearing him at this place where</v>
<v Speaker 2>this one is going to be and he was</v>

954
00:51:30.351 --> 00:51:31.184
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

955
00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:34.700
<v Speaker 2>I tried it a couple of times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by Golly,</v>

956
00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:37.760
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot like dmt dealing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

957
00:51:38.870 --> 00:51:39.840
<v Speaker 2>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

958
00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:40.723
<v Speaker 2>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

959
00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:42.950
<v Speaker 2>it looks like a floor lamp.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

960
00:51:43.040 --> 00:51:44.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

961
00:51:44.361 --> 00:51:48.350
<v Speaker 2>It's got a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got this array of ld leds on a,</v>

962
00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:50.150
<v Speaker 2>on a holder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You lie under it.</v>

963
00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:55.280
<v Speaker 2>And if they're just white leds and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>programs that from his ipad,</v>

964
00:51:55.281 --> 00:52:00.281
<v Speaker 2>I guess in different sequences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you lie under this thing for a few</v>

965
00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:03.860
<v Speaker 2>minutes and pretty soon you get into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>zone,</v>

966
00:52:03.861 --> 00:52:08.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these visuals begin to manifest and it</v>

967
00:52:08.781 --> 00:52:13.781
<v Speaker 2>looks a great deal like dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So them and he claims,</v>

968
00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:17.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's synthesizing dmt and the pineal and</v>

969
00:52:17.931 --> 00:52:22.931
<v Speaker 2>it is very much like dmt would be if</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's released at the site of action,</v>

970
00:52:24.861 --> 00:52:27.300
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dmt is when you smoke it,</v>

971
00:52:27.301 --> 00:52:30.170
<v Speaker 2>it brings some big body load,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which you have to wear that goofy</v>

972
00:52:30.171 --> 00:52:31.004
<v Speaker 2>outfit.</v>

973
00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:32.730
<v Speaker 2>What's with the orange outfit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seriously,</v>

974
00:52:32.731 --> 00:52:37.340
<v Speaker 2>I can tell that they're in Thailand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I understand that.</v>

975
00:52:37.341 --> 00:52:41.150
<v Speaker 2>The expression of muchness the pious</v>
<v Speaker 2>outfit,</v>

976
00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:44.630
<v Speaker 2>let it go folks just where wear a tee</v>
<v Speaker 2>shirt or whatever.</v>

977
00:52:44.631 --> 00:52:48.380
<v Speaker 2>I would just have to get into a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

978
00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:52.670
<v Speaker 2>into an econ student to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I wouldn't do it a couple times.</v>

979
00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:54.620
<v Speaker 2>How many times did you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

980
00:52:54.621 --> 00:52:58.730
<v Speaker 2>I was not there long enough to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it a couple times and this woman's</v>

981
00:52:58.731 --> 00:53:02.000
<v Speaker 2>setting is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is just effective sitting as it as lying</v>

982
00:53:02.001 --> 00:53:03.060
<v Speaker 2>down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

983
00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:05.720
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I expect so you lie,</v>

984
00:53:05.870 --> 00:53:10.020
<v Speaker 2>you lie down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I laid down and close your eyes and know</v>

985
00:53:10.021 --> 00:53:10.761
<v Speaker 2>it well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

986
00:53:10.761 --> 00:53:13.610
<v Speaker 2>you close your eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Doesn't matter because it's coming</v>

987
00:53:13.611 --> 00:53:15.640
<v Speaker 2>through.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have eyeshades on</v>

988
00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:22.150
<v Speaker 2>and usually he's playing some music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then you know in me like the</v>

989
00:53:22.821 --> 00:53:26.340
<v Speaker 2>reductionist kicks in and says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well guy,</v>

990
00:53:26.370 --> 00:53:27.420
<v Speaker 2>this is interesting.</v>

991
00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:31.170
<v Speaker 2>How do you know it's really dmt that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

992
00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:35.340
<v Speaker 2>that you're stimulating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we've been going back and forth on</v>

993
00:53:35.341 --> 00:53:37.540
<v Speaker 2>that and how can you test that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there,</v>

994
00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:41.310
<v Speaker 2>there are ways to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but most of them involve some fairly</v>

995
00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:47.520
<v Speaker 2>drastic procedures like you can do that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't want to do on people</v>

996
00:53:47.521 --> 00:53:50.370
<v Speaker 2>because they wouldn't give you</v>
<v Speaker 2>permission if they had any sense.</v>

997
00:53:50.371 --> 00:53:54.210
<v Speaker 2>But you could do two rats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could do something called micro</v>

998
00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:57.300
<v Speaker 2>dialysis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can put a centrally,</v>

999
00:53:57.301 --> 00:53:59.500
<v Speaker 2>a microscopic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a</v>

1000
00:54:01.110 --> 00:54:06.110
<v Speaker 2>tube that's absorbed the next to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>pineal and you can collect samples that</v>

1001
00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:09.750
<v Speaker 2>you detect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not something that people would</v>

1002
00:54:09.810 --> 00:54:12.420
<v Speaker 2>volunteer for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about just take,</v>

1003
00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:16.020
<v Speaker 2>take your word for it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I just want to know does it really</v>

1004
00:54:16.021 --> 00:54:18.570
<v Speaker 2>reduce it or not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am not saying it does,</v>

1005
00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:21.870
<v Speaker 2>but it's a lot like dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about hovering something like that</v>

1006
00:54:21.871 --> 00:54:24.970
<v Speaker 2>over a sensory deprivation tank,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like being inside of it and having it</v>

1007
00:54:24.971 --> 00:54:29.220
<v Speaker 2>hover over your head so you have the</v>
<v Speaker 2>added experience of out of body with</v>

1008
00:54:29.221 --> 00:54:29.640
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

1009
00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:33.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean I would think that'd be pretty</v>
<v Speaker 2>intense and not hard to recreate.</v>

1010
00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:36.540
<v Speaker 2>Probably not you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably what you'd probably want to do</v>

1011
00:54:36.541 --> 00:54:38.790
<v Speaker 2>with that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this to have some kind of goggles</v>

1012
00:54:38.791 --> 00:54:43.230
<v Speaker 2>essentially that could be connected to</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

1013
00:54:43.290 --> 00:54:45.990
<v Speaker 2>to his program by Bluetooth or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

1014
00:54:45.991 --> 00:54:49.170
<v Speaker 2>so then you're wearing the goggles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're in the isolation tank,</v>

1015
00:54:50.070 --> 00:54:53.790
<v Speaker 2>but if you just hover it over your head,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you just have an arm like a computer</v>

1016
00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:59.030
<v Speaker 2>monitor arm and just swing it over the</v>
<v Speaker 2>head and so you turned it on,</v>

1017
00:54:59.190 --> 00:55:00.360
<v Speaker 2>close the door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 10,</v>

1018
00:55:00.370 --> 00:55:03.840
<v Speaker 2>close your eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lay back and maybe it has like a 32nd</v>

1019
00:55:03.841 --> 00:55:07.140
<v Speaker 2>window or lets you settle in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You then begins the program.</v>

1020
00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:11.160
<v Speaker 2>Lots of ways you could approach it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That just seems to me doing really ramp</v>

1021
00:55:11.161 --> 00:55:13.140
<v Speaker 2>it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now here's the question.</v>

1022
00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:17.700
<v Speaker 2>Interesting though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just one of an array of,</v>

1023
00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:21.510
<v Speaker 2>you know what you might call</v>
<v Speaker 2>neurotechnology is you know,</v>

1024
00:55:21.511 --> 00:55:23.580
<v Speaker 2>or even spiritual technologies.</v>

1025
00:55:24.030 --> 00:55:26.340
<v Speaker 2>Maybe this'll make psychedelics</v>
<v Speaker 2>obsolete.</v>

1026
00:55:26.610 --> 00:55:28.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a great way that you could do it</v>

1027
00:55:28.291 --> 00:55:31.680
<v Speaker 2>without actually having to hold onto an</v>
<v Speaker 2>illegal drug.</v>

1028
00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:33.190
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does.</v>

1029
00:55:33.191 --> 00:55:36.360
<v Speaker 2>You're carrying your illegal drug with</v>
<v Speaker 2>you so far,</v>

1030
00:55:36.361 --> 00:55:38.970
<v Speaker 2>they can arrest you for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although I'm sure they're trying to</v>

1031
00:55:38.971 --> 00:55:41.670
<v Speaker 2>figure out a way that was your brother's</v>
<v Speaker 2>classic line.</v>

1032
00:55:41.671 --> 00:55:46.671
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's holding everyone's holding</v>
<v Speaker 2>now with this stuff.</v>

1033
00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:50.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you experience the communication</v>

1034
00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:54.690
<v Speaker 2>that you get with DMT?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because that to me has always been the</v>

1035
00:55:54.691 --> 00:55:58.830
<v Speaker 2>most profound aspect of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this feeling that I'm in the presence</v>

1036
00:55:58.831 --> 00:56:03.831
<v Speaker 2>of something and then they sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>telekinetic understanding the words but</v>

1037
00:56:04.441 --> 00:56:07.380
<v Speaker 2>not hearing the words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>

1038
00:56:07.381 --> 00:56:11.490
<v Speaker 2>I didn't get that because I think I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>not under long enough.</v>

1039
00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:15.480
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have much time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was only under each time it was</v>

1040
00:56:15.481 --> 00:56:17.760
<v Speaker 2>under maybe 20 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which isn't.</v>

1041
00:56:18.150 --> 00:56:23.070
<v Speaker 2>I think if I'd stayed in that place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I could settle into it for an hour,</v>

1042
00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:25.750
<v Speaker 2>I think that probably would manifest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1043
00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:28.920
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Diana is what,</v>

1044
00:56:28.950 --> 00:56:30.640
<v Speaker 2>why do you think this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do you think would change?</v>

1045
00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:33.850
<v Speaker 2>Takes Awhile for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the thing to fully,</v>

1046
00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:36.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1047
00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:41.500
<v Speaker 2>whatever the term is for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it is dmt for the DM t to reach a</v>

1048
00:56:44.621 --> 00:56:47.290
<v Speaker 2>critical level where you're seeing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of stuff,</v>

1049
00:56:47.390 --> 00:56:50.350
<v Speaker 2>you feel this because it was ramping up</v>
<v Speaker 2>during your experience.</v>

1050
00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:53.980
<v Speaker 2>I felt like it was that if I had stuck</v>
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>

1051
00:56:53.981 --> 00:56:55.840
<v Speaker 2>I thought it would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1052
00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:59.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought it would develop and we've</v>

1053
00:56:59.171 --> 00:57:00.910
<v Speaker 2>talked about too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've talked about,</v>

1054
00:57:01.460 --> 00:57:04.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking about how to establish that</v>

1055
00:57:04.901 --> 00:57:09.730
<v Speaker 2>this really is dmt and other approach</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we've tried is to take a or the</v>

1056
00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:12.280
<v Speaker 2>guys tried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have access to the light,</v>

1057
00:57:12.370 --> 00:57:14.410
<v Speaker 2>I can't afford it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but guys,</v>

1058
00:57:15.670 --> 00:57:19.830
<v Speaker 2>it costs about 3,300 bucks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1059
00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:24.250
<v Speaker 2>which is not bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but beyond my pay grade,</v>

1060
00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:27.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to buy for you for a present,</v>
<v Speaker 2>buy it and keep it.</v>

1061
00:57:27.941 --> 00:57:29.160
<v Speaker 2>You're going to buy two of them.</v>

1062
00:57:29.180 --> 00:57:32.080
<v Speaker 2>I'll buy one for you and me will</v>
<v Speaker 2>correspond.</v>

1063
00:57:32.490 --> 00:57:33.490
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

1064
00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:38.500
<v Speaker 2>well now we're going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I might mention that the guy is offering</v>

1065
00:57:38.501 --> 00:57:42.370
<v Speaker 2>a conference special here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't have to wear the outfit.</v>

1066
00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:43.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No you don't.</v>

1067
00:57:43.930 --> 00:57:47.110
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll get a discount on it.</v>

1068
00:57:47.111 --> 00:57:50.710
<v Speaker 2>If you go through the facebook site,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I'm about to put this beautiful,</v>

1069
00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:55.690
<v Speaker 2>we can talk about this offline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but through facebook some portion of it</v>

1070
00:57:55.720 --> 00:57:58.050
<v Speaker 2>will go toward supporting this</v>
<v Speaker 2>conference.</v>

1071
00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:01.710
<v Speaker 2>So I would love that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm very curious about this because I'm,</v>

1072
00:58:01.970 --> 00:58:05.170
<v Speaker 2>I know that I have a good buddy of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friend Danny,</v>

1073
00:58:05.171 --> 00:58:10.000
<v Speaker 2>who's done a Kundalini for quite a long</v>
<v Speaker 2>time and he can reproduce dmt states.</v>

1074
00:58:10.001 --> 00:58:14.470
<v Speaker 2>He's actually had dmt experiences</v>
<v Speaker 2>independently of the Kundalini and he</v>

1075
00:58:14.471 --> 00:58:16.870
<v Speaker 2>says it's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He says he can get there and I believe</v>

1076
00:58:16.871 --> 00:58:17.590
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

1077
00:58:17.590 --> 00:58:19.780
<v Speaker 2>I just too lazy or something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is.</v>

1078
00:58:19.781 --> 00:58:21.670
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not inclined.</v>

1079
00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:23.880
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a genetic component,</v>

1080
00:58:23.881 --> 00:58:25.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like this gentleman,</v>

1081
00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:30.100
<v Speaker 2>although he has a tumor [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure why.</v>

1082
00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:34.480
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he doesn't want medical people</v>
<v Speaker 2>poking and prodding him,</v>

1083
00:58:34.481 --> 00:58:38.350
<v Speaker 2>but he would be a perfect subject to</v>
<v Speaker 2>settle a lot of issues.</v>

1084
00:58:38.450 --> 00:58:41.340
<v Speaker 2>She was willing to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1085
00:58:41.560 --> 00:58:43.990
<v Speaker 2>cooperate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean just having a look at his</v>

1086
00:58:43.991 --> 00:58:46.630
<v Speaker 2>cerebral spinal fluid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would be the obvious,</v>

1087
00:58:46.740 --> 00:58:50.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fluid to sample for this would be very</v>

1088
00:58:50.441 --> 00:58:51.430
<v Speaker 2>interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1089
00:58:51.560 --> 00:58:54.100
<v Speaker 2>But I could understand his reluctance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he has reluctance.</v>

1090
00:58:54.550 --> 00:58:58.360
<v Speaker 2>People are drilling into your dome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kinda suck out brain juice.</v>

1091
00:58:58.670 --> 00:59:01.750
<v Speaker 2>Does it sound fun?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it is interesting though,</v>

1092
00:59:01.751 --> 00:59:06.751
<v Speaker 2>that these compounds are in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in some way a part of normal human</v>

1093
00:59:07.271 --> 00:59:10.150
<v Speaker 2>neurochemistry and why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1094
00:59:10.151 --> 00:59:11.590
<v Speaker 2>And Dave Nichols,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does he believe?</v>

1095
00:59:13.090 --> 00:59:15.100
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if he believes anything.</v>

1096
00:59:15.101 --> 00:59:16.110
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1097
00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:18.660
<v Speaker 2>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1098
00:59:19.390 --> 00:59:21.170
<v Speaker 2>he just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just skeptical that,</v>

1099
00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:26.320
<v Speaker 2>that in normal physiological processes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dmt has much of a function.</v>

1100
00:59:26.420 --> 00:59:30.020
<v Speaker 2>What about dreams?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dreams are a possibility and that's</v>

1101
00:59:30.021 --> 00:59:31.190
<v Speaker 2>always been the big one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1102
00:59:31.250 --> 00:59:34.010
<v Speaker 2>That's always been the big one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's totally plausible.</v>

1103
00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:37.090
<v Speaker 2>You'll have to get him on here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tim,</v>

1104
00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:38.600
<v Speaker 2>explain it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would love to.</v>

1105
00:59:39.220 --> 00:59:40.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1106
00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:42.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure.</v>

1107
00:59:42.561 --> 00:59:47.150
<v Speaker 2>He just has this idea that I think for</v>
<v Speaker 2>one thing,</v>

1108
00:59:47.151 --> 00:59:47.990
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1109
00:59:48.030 --> 00:59:50.860
<v Speaker 2>he's kind of a reductionist guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the,</v>

1110
00:59:51.350 --> 00:59:55.650
<v Speaker 2>all the new age stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new excitement about the empty them,</v>

1111
00:59:55.660 --> 00:59:58.070
<v Speaker 2>hi Neil and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It kind of puts them off.</v>

1112
00:59:58.790 --> 01:00:03.630
<v Speaker 2>But on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't assume that we know everything.</v>

1113
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.210
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we know nothing,</v>

1114
01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:06.770
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if it's there,</v>

1115
01:00:06.771 --> 01:00:08.540
<v Speaker 2>I think it probably does have a</v>
<v Speaker 2>function,</v>

1116
01:00:09.270 --> 01:00:12.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not surprising that it's there,</v>

1117
01:00:12.591 --> 01:00:13.610
<v Speaker 2>it's everywhere.</v>

1118
01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:17.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's DMT is interesting molecule because</v>

1119
01:00:17.451 --> 01:00:19.520
<v Speaker 2>it's two steps from Tryptofan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1120
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:23.780
<v Speaker 2>Tryptophan is an amino acid and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>essential amino acid,</v>

1121
01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:29.320
<v Speaker 2>one of the 20 that goes into proteins.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So tryptophan is an every living thing</v>

1122
01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:34.390
<v Speaker 2>on this planet and there are two enzymes</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are also pretty much universal in</v>

1123
01:00:35.871 --> 01:00:40.871
<v Speaker 2>cells that can convert dmt or Tryptofan</v>
<v Speaker 2>to dmt in two simple steps.</v>

1124
01:00:42.410 --> 01:00:44.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to get too into the</v>

1125
01:00:44.241 --> 01:00:48.080
<v Speaker 2>chemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but basically you remove the amino acid</v>

1126
01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:51.860
<v Speaker 2>portion of the amino acid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get tryptamine and from there you</v>

1127
01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:54.980
<v Speaker 2>add the methyl groups and there you are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1128
01:00:55.160 --> 01:01:00.160
<v Speaker 2>which is why DMT is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very common in plants for example.</v>

1129
01:01:01.521 --> 01:01:03.390
<v Speaker 2>And Anna Animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I,</v>

1130
01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:08.500
<v Speaker 2>I tell people nature is drenched in dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Drenched is a great transcribe DMT.</v>

1131
01:01:08.990 --> 01:01:13.990
<v Speaker 2>There are thousands and thousands and</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of species of plants that</v>

1132
01:01:14.481 --> 01:01:16.490
<v Speaker 2>contain DMT for sure.</v>

1133
01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.440
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they haven't,</v>

1134
01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:22.310
<v Speaker 2>there hasn't been any survey or anything</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1135
01:01:22.311 --> 01:01:25.910
<v Speaker 2>But if you look at the gender that have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of DMT,</v>

1136
01:01:25.911 --> 01:01:30.380
<v Speaker 2>like Acacia is a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Australian acacias are some of the</v>

1137
01:01:30.381 --> 01:01:35.381
<v Speaker 2>strongest sources of DMT.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's 1700 species of vacation,</v>

1138
01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:42.880
<v Speaker 2>probably 75 percent of them contain DMT</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sure you're aware of the Israeli</v>

1139
01:01:44.210 --> 01:01:48.170
<v Speaker 2>scientists that believe that the story</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Noah,</v>

1140
01:01:48.310 --> 01:01:52.160
<v Speaker 2>it's not Moses rather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the burning Bush was the Acacia tree</v>

1141
01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:57.140
<v Speaker 2>and they think that that was the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the confusion of all the translations.</v>

1142
01:01:57.141 --> 01:01:59.600
<v Speaker 2>And of course the oral history passed</v>
<v Speaker 2>down over many,</v>

1143
01:01:59.601 --> 01:02:01.490
<v Speaker 2>many years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then finally written down.</v>

1144
01:02:01.670 --> 01:02:06.260
<v Speaker 2>But this idea of the burning Bush</v>
<v Speaker 2>delivering the word of God was most</v>

1145
01:02:06.261 --> 01:02:11.000
<v Speaker 2>likely in some way a psychedelic trip</v>
<v Speaker 2>induced by DMT and most likely because</v>

1146
01:02:11.001 --> 01:02:14.190
<v Speaker 2>of the acacia tree,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most likely the acacia tree,</v>

1147
01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:16.460
<v Speaker 2>because that was in the area,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1148
01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:20.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean an interesting idea.</v>

1149
01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:22.590
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's interesting that the,</v>

1150
01:02:22.650 --> 01:02:23.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1151
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:29.000
<v Speaker 2>sort of the way that the burning Bush</v>
<v Speaker 2>presented itself was like dmt presents</v>

1152
01:02:29.911 --> 01:02:32.760
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You cannot take your eyes away from it,</v>

1153
01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:34.880
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time you cannot look at.</v>

1154
01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:38.820
<v Speaker 2>But Pharma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't even know what you're saying.</v>

1155
01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:42.820
<v Speaker 2>There was this something that he smoked</v>
<v Speaker 2>was in incense.</v>

1156
01:02:42.821 --> 01:02:44.960
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he exposed to this and uh,</v>

1157
01:02:45.690 --> 01:02:48.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because that will make a difference</v>

1158
01:02:48.061 --> 01:02:52.320
<v Speaker 2>because you can't eat dmt because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>destroyed by monoamine oxidase.</v>

1159
01:02:52.321 --> 01:02:56.160
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the whole basis of Iowasca in</v>

1160
01:02:56.161 --> 01:02:59.430
<v Speaker 2>terms of these Acacias,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1161
01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:01.260
<v Speaker 2>the question comes up also.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll.</v>

1162
01:03:01.261 --> 01:03:03.840
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of them are native to Australia.</v>

1163
01:03:03.900 --> 01:03:08.670
<v Speaker 2>So did the aborigines know about this</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you look at their art,</v>

1164
01:03:08.950 --> 01:03:10.890
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looks like dmt.</v>

1165
01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:14.470
<v Speaker 2>It's very psychedelic art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't really looked at very much</v>

1166
01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:18.930
<v Speaker 2>point to list kind of designs in</v>
<v Speaker 2>aboriginal art.</v>

1167
01:03:18.931 --> 01:03:22.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're extremely psychedelics if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could find some of that.</v>

1168
01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:24.790
<v Speaker 2>But they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

1169
01:03:24.850 --> 01:03:28.410
<v Speaker 2>the aborigines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they had to know about it.</v>

1170
01:03:28.590 --> 01:03:33.220
<v Speaker 2>They're just not talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one possible way that they could</v>

1171
01:03:33.221 --> 01:03:36.570
<v Speaker 2>have used it because the dmt and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>acacias is so high.</v>

1172
01:03:36.570 --> 01:03:39.390
<v Speaker 2>The leaves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of these cases there are two</v>

1173
01:03:39.391 --> 01:03:41.640
<v Speaker 2>percent dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1174
01:03:41.730 --> 01:03:46.730
<v Speaker 2>So if you were to take leaves and throw</v>
<v Speaker 2>them on a fire in a enclosed space,</v>

1175
01:03:47.761 --> 01:03:52.440
<v Speaker 2>like a sweat lodge type space,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could potentially get quite loaded</v>

1176
01:03:52.441 --> 01:03:54.960
<v Speaker 2>on dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no indication that they smoked</v>

1177
01:03:54.961 --> 01:03:58.620
<v Speaker 2>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they may have fumigated themselves</v>

1178
01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:00.060
<v Speaker 2>with tmt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1179
01:04:00.061 --> 01:04:02.640
<v Speaker 2>that completely makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're talking about a burning Bush.</v>

1180
01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:03.481
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1181
01:04:03.481 --> 01:04:04.490
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's.</v>

1182
01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:06.750
<v Speaker 2>How does that make its way to Israel</v>
<v Speaker 2>though?</v>

1183
01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:08.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe this,</v>

1184
01:04:09.090 --> 01:04:11.700
<v Speaker 2>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows where anything makes its way.</v>

1185
01:04:11.701 --> 01:04:14.340
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these folks technologies,</v>

1186
01:04:14.430 --> 01:04:17.760
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the,</v>

1187
01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:20.550
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the new world,</v>

1188
01:04:20.580 --> 01:04:22.010
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1189
01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:24.780
<v Speaker 2>in the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the historical sense,</v>

1190
01:04:25.530 --> 01:04:29.100
<v Speaker 2>people have remarked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are there so more so many more</v>

1191
01:04:29.101 --> 01:04:31.890
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic plants in the new world and</v>
<v Speaker 2>old world,</v>

1192
01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:36.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something about people people's</v>

1193
01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:41.070
<v Speaker 2>relationship to plants in this very high</v>
<v Speaker 2>biodiversity environment.</v>

1194
01:04:41.070 --> 01:04:43.410
<v Speaker 2>People are mucking around with plants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1195
01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:49.460
<v Speaker 2>Like a perpetual question that comes up</v>
<v Speaker 2>is how did they figure out how to</v>

1196
01:04:51.481 --> 01:04:56.481
<v Speaker 2>combine banisteriopsis and CITCO trick</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get the activity of Iowasca?</v>

1197
01:04:57.991 --> 01:05:01.470
<v Speaker 2>How out of 80,000 species and the Amazon</v>
<v Speaker 2>did they figure out.</v>

1198
01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:05.280
<v Speaker 2>Can you guys please,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the uninitiated,</v>

1199
01:05:05.281 --> 01:05:07.250
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why that's important with the model you</v>

1200
01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:08.011
<v Speaker 2>not?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1201
01:05:08.011 --> 01:05:12.330
<v Speaker 2>it's important because banisteriopsis</v>
<v Speaker 2>contains these alkaloids called Beta</v>

1202
01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:15.480
<v Speaker 2>lanes that are monoamine oxidase</v>
<v Speaker 2>inhibitors,</v>

1203
01:05:15.481 --> 01:05:20.481
<v Speaker 2>and monoamine oxidase is the enzyme in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gut that breaks down Dmt,</v>

1204
01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:26.740
<v Speaker 2>so you can drink tea with dmt in it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can eat it all day.</v>

1205
01:05:26.770 --> 01:05:31.770
<v Speaker 2>Nothing's going to happen because this</v>
<v Speaker 2>enzyme will inactivate it.</v>

1206
01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:35.560
<v Speaker 2>And that's probably a reflection of an</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary process,</v>

1207
01:05:35.561 --> 01:05:38.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've adapted to toxins in our</v>

1208
01:05:38.261 --> 01:05:39.820
<v Speaker 2>environment basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1209
01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:43.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you inhibit that with the alkaloids</v>

1210
01:05:43.481 --> 01:05:46.120
<v Speaker 2>from the banisteriopsis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're very potent,</v>

1211
01:05:46.121 --> 01:05:51.121
<v Speaker 2>very selective Mao inhibitors that</v>
<v Speaker 2>protects it from degradation in the gut.</v>

1212
01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:55.570
<v Speaker 2>It can cross into the blood and into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>blood brain barrier.</v>

1213
01:05:55.571 --> 01:06:00.571
<v Speaker 2>So that's the basis of the oral activity</v>
<v Speaker 2>and people make much about how they sort</v>

1214
01:06:04.121 --> 01:06:07.060
<v Speaker 2>of stumbled on this combination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1215
01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:10.120
<v Speaker 2>And in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of our presenters at this</v>

1216
01:06:10.121 --> 01:06:13.450
<v Speaker 2>conference,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Manuel Torres as an archeologist,</v>

1217
01:06:13.451 --> 01:06:15.970
<v Speaker 2>has been looking at this for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for quite a while.</v>

1218
01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:19.570
<v Speaker 2>If,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is a,</v>

1219
01:06:19.880 --> 01:06:22.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the sort of Gee whiz</v>

1220
01:06:22.241 --> 01:06:24.350
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did these primitive people figure</v>

1221
01:06:24.351 --> 01:06:26.380
<v Speaker 2>out how to combine these plants?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1222
01:06:26.770 --> 01:06:29.530
<v Speaker 2>I agree with remarkable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you talk to the Shaman and they'll</v>

1223
01:06:29.531 --> 01:06:29.921
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1224
01:06:29.921 --> 01:06:33.700
<v Speaker 2>the plants told us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what does that mean?</v>

1225
01:06:33.701 --> 01:06:37.420
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and but what,</v>

1226
01:06:37.480 --> 01:06:42.160
<v Speaker 2>what is interesting to me in a way or</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I've been thinking about lately,</v>

1227
01:06:42.161 --> 01:06:44.260
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the archeology of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

1228
01:06:44.290 --> 01:06:49.240
<v Speaker 2>the snuffs that there are two or three</v>
<v Speaker 2>different kinds of snuffs that are used</v>

1229
01:06:49.241 --> 01:06:54.241
<v Speaker 2>in South America that contain DMT,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the antigen anthracite snuffs and the</v>

1230
01:06:54.611 --> 01:06:58.420
<v Speaker 2>Varroa snuffs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the antigen anthracnose knifes are</v>

1231
01:06:58.510 --> 01:06:59.200
<v Speaker 2>ancient.</v>

1232
01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:03.910
<v Speaker 2>We have archeological evidence that puts</v>
<v Speaker 2>that back to 10,</v>

1233
01:07:04.030 --> 01:07:09.030
<v Speaker 2>11,000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are by far the most ancient</v>

1234
01:07:10.511 --> 01:07:14.530
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics used in the new world or</v>
<v Speaker 2>these snuffs that contain dmt.</v>

1235
01:07:15.010 --> 01:07:19.060
<v Speaker 2>Nobody is asking the question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what possessed these people to take the</v>

1236
01:07:19.061 --> 01:07:21.820
<v Speaker 2>seeds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>grind them up and shove them up their</v>

1237
01:07:21.821 --> 01:07:22.810
<v Speaker 2>nose.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1238
01:07:22.811 --> 01:07:27.700
<v Speaker 2>this is not something that intuitively</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would do,</v>

1239
01:07:28.570 --> 01:07:33.570
<v Speaker 2>and yet that seems to me as easily as</v>
<v Speaker 2>puzzling is how did they find the</v>

1240
01:07:33.581 --> 01:07:37.120
<v Speaker 2>combination for Iowa Ska?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's really addressed that.</v>

1241
01:07:37.210 --> 01:07:40.870
<v Speaker 2>My first impulse when I meet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I find a new plant is not</v>

1242
01:07:40.871 --> 01:07:44.110
<v Speaker 2>necessarily to snort it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't that the place of the</v>

1243
01:07:44.111 --> 01:07:47.380
<v Speaker 2>pharmacological daredevil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's always this one person</v>

1244
01:07:47.381 --> 01:07:48.550
<v Speaker 2>who's out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1245
01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:49.570
<v Speaker 2>Jack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I found,</v>

1246
01:07:49.830 --> 01:07:50.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>

1247
01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:54.190
<v Speaker 2>that curiosity that need to explore</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

1248
01:07:54.220 --> 01:07:55.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly right.</v>

1249
01:07:55.660 --> 01:08:00.630
<v Speaker 2>Somebody stumbled on this and I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same is true of Iowaska.</v>

1250
01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:03.610
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because the fact dmt is not that</v>

1251
01:08:03.611 --> 01:08:07.960
<v Speaker 2>uncommon truth to tell made a carbon</v>
<v Speaker 2>liens are not that uncommon.</v>

1252
01:08:07.961 --> 01:08:12.010
<v Speaker 2>So sooner or later people are going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>stumble on this combination.</v>

1253
01:08:12.490 --> 01:08:14.710
<v Speaker 2>Once they did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>

1254
01:08:15.470 --> 01:08:17.630
<v Speaker 2>they share with them knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just took time.</v>

1255
01:08:17.670 --> 01:08:19.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes time.</v>

1256
01:08:19.330 --> 01:08:20.420
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think there's.</v>

1257
01:08:20.450 --> 01:08:22.760
<v Speaker 2>It is possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean obviously it's possible,</v>

1258
01:08:22.761 --> 01:08:27.761
<v Speaker 2>but is there any evidence that points to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea that primitive primates maybe</v>

1259
01:08:29.900 --> 01:08:34.900
<v Speaker 2>didn't have this monoamine oxidase and</v>
<v Speaker 2>their system and that or if they did,</v>

1260
01:08:35.211 --> 01:08:39.380
<v Speaker 2>they had it in lower amounts and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>allowed more dimethyltryptamine to enter</v>

1261
01:08:39.381 --> 01:08:41.890
<v Speaker 2>into the body from consuming plants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like is,</v>

1262
01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:46.760
<v Speaker 2>is there a potential link between</v>
<v Speaker 2>consuming various plants?</v>

1263
01:08:46.761 --> 01:08:48.050
<v Speaker 2>Like we're talking about thousands of</v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

1264
01:08:48.051 --> 01:08:50.720
<v Speaker 2>Like you could eat a salad if you didn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have model amy and oxidase and you've</v>

1265
01:08:50.721 --> 01:08:52.550
<v Speaker 2>got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can eat a salad and potentially</v>

1266
01:08:52.551 --> 01:08:53.120
<v Speaker 2>trip.</v>

1267
01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:56.200
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you didn't have it right is right and</v>

1268
01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:59.210
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you see Jaguars that do trip,</v>

1269
01:08:59.270 --> 01:09:01.700
<v Speaker 2>like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's all this footage of Jaguars in</v>

1270
01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:05.480
<v Speaker 2>the jungle eating these plants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are they doing?</v>

1271
01:09:06.710 --> 01:09:09.080
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do we know or we don't know what.</v>

1272
01:09:09.081 --> 01:09:12.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure how much I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much credence I put into that</v>

1273
01:09:12.530 --> 01:09:14.600
<v Speaker 2>footage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it could be like catnip,</v>

1274
01:09:14.710 --> 01:09:16.740
<v Speaker 2>like maybe looks like happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1275
01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:19.850
<v Speaker 2>but they're eating Bev stereopsis</v>
<v Speaker 2>apparently,</v>

1276
01:09:19.851 --> 01:09:23.500
<v Speaker 2>which doesn't have dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got the Beta carbon blades but,</v>

1277
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:27.560
<v Speaker 2>but harming alone contained some</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychoactive compounds.</v>

1278
01:09:27.561 --> 01:09:28.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>

1279
01:09:28.610 --> 01:09:33.200
<v Speaker 2>And there are three main Beta car</v>
<v Speaker 2>bylines in baptistery stereopsis.</v>

1280
01:09:33.600 --> 01:09:35.360
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what I'm talking about,</v>

1281
01:09:35.450 --> 01:09:40.450
<v Speaker 2>half the conference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My talk is about Beta carbon cleans a</v>

1282
01:09:41.091 --> 01:09:44.240
<v Speaker 2>lot of activity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea that they're not psychoactive,</v>

1283
01:09:44.241 --> 01:09:47.840
<v Speaker 2>that they're just Mao inhibitors is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>really true.</v>

1284
01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:51.510
<v Speaker 2>It's an incomplete picture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are a,</v>

1285
01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:54.780
<v Speaker 2>a lot of other activities with Beta</v>
<v Speaker 2>carbon,</v>

1286
01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:59.060
<v Speaker 2>so a lot of attention recently refocused</v>
<v Speaker 2>on harming,</v>

1287
01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:02.120
<v Speaker 2>which is the main Beta Carmelina and</v>
<v Speaker 2>three opsis.</v>

1288
01:10:02.150 --> 01:10:07.150
<v Speaker 2>Turns out it has all kinds of activities</v>
<v Speaker 2>that have been sort of overlooked and</v>

1289
01:10:08.450 --> 01:10:12.280
<v Speaker 2>now not least of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it stimulates a neurogenesis.</v>

1290
01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:17.380
<v Speaker 2>It stimulates a nerve cell growth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is big news because it's huge.</v>

1291
01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:22.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And potentially it,</v>

1292
01:10:22.990 --> 01:10:25.700
<v Speaker 2>it inhibits a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

1293
01:10:25.780 --> 01:10:30.470
<v Speaker 2>a kinase which has to do with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>kinases approach,</v>

1294
01:10:30.530 --> 01:10:33.080
<v Speaker 2>a protein that phosphorolates things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1295
01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:37.370
<v Speaker 2>Very common.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All kinds of kinases around the body,</v>

1296
01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:42.880
<v Speaker 2>but it inhibits this one particular</v>
<v Speaker 2>kinase called our k one,</v>

1297
01:10:43.190 --> 01:10:47.630
<v Speaker 2>whatever that means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is associated with the,</v>

1298
01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:52.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the stimulation of a nerve growth</v>

1299
01:10:52.101 --> 01:10:56.600
<v Speaker 2>from neural stem cells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is all petri plate test tube stuff,</v>

1300
01:10:57.230 --> 01:11:00.980
<v Speaker 2>but it's not unreasonable to think that</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is going on in the bud.</v>

1301
01:11:01.220 --> 01:11:05.480
<v Speaker 2>So if that plays a part in neurogenesis</v>
<v Speaker 2>that could potentially have some real</v>

1302
01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:09.890
<v Speaker 2>benefits to people that have things like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Parkinson's or nerve disorders or</v>

1303
01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:15.040
<v Speaker 2>exactly maybe ptsd or a cte rather it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could add or you know,</v>

1304
01:11:17.131 --> 01:11:22.131
<v Speaker 2>especially dementia's like fog and</v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive Alzheimer's or other types of</v>

1305
01:11:23.671 --> 01:11:28.200
<v Speaker 2>dementia that are not strictly</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alzheimer's that are just kind of senile</v>

1306
01:11:28.201 --> 01:11:29.034
<v Speaker 2>dementia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dementias.</v>

1307
01:11:29.630 --> 01:11:32.700
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I hope it's true because this is</v>

1308
01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:33.850
<v Speaker 2>going to kick you right back.</v>

1309
01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:38.910
<v Speaker 2>This is my main prophylactic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get civility.</v>

1310
01:11:38.911 --> 01:11:43.380
<v Speaker 2>I figured if I take Iowasca regularly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably going to be okay.</v>

1311
01:11:43.381 --> 01:11:44.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right back in the game.</v>

1312
01:11:44.971 --> 01:11:49.971
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if that's the case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What one of the talks that I listened to</v>

1313
01:11:50.710 --> 01:11:52.890
<v Speaker 2>have your brothers from way back in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

1314
01:11:52.891 --> 01:11:57.840
<v Speaker 2>He was talking about a scientific</v>
<v Speaker 2>nomenclature related to harming and that</v>

1315
01:11:57.841 --> 01:11:59.120
<v Speaker 2>before they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1316
01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:04.230
<v Speaker 2>one of the recent or one of the early</v>
<v Speaker 2>explorers to South America when they</v>

1317
01:12:04.231 --> 01:12:06.710
<v Speaker 2>found this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were calling it telepathy.</v>

1318
01:12:07.290 --> 01:12:09.860
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were calling it telepathy because</v>

1319
01:12:09.861 --> 01:12:14.760
<v Speaker 2>it induced these groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>states of telepathy because rumor,</v>

1320
01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:15.600
<v Speaker 2>rumor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>deuce.</v>

1321
01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:16.181
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

1322
01:12:16.181 --> 01:12:18.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you want to get into the,</v>

1323
01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:22.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what you could call the sordid history</v>

1324
01:12:22.471 --> 01:12:27.471
<v Speaker 2>of the chemistry investigations of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iowaska because harming and harm ilene</v>

1325
01:12:30.330 --> 01:12:31.200
<v Speaker 2>and Tetra,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hydro,</v>

1326
01:12:31.201 --> 01:12:33.500
<v Speaker 2>heart and Liza were originally found in</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>

1327
01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:37.730
<v Speaker 2>which is where they got their names,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is Siri unruh.</v>

1328
01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:40.730
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a lot of people use that as an</v>

1329
01:12:40.740 --> 01:12:44.400
<v Speaker 2>alternative mal when they are making it</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iowasca analogues.</v>

1330
01:12:44.940 --> 01:12:49.940
<v Speaker 2>So that's how those alkaloids got their</v>
<v Speaker 2>names and then when chemists came along,</v>

1331
01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:55.620
<v Speaker 2>kind of all through the 19th century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they started looking at banisteriopsis</v>

1332
01:12:55.621 --> 01:12:59.190
<v Speaker 2>and they would isolate things and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't know what to call them.</v>

1333
01:12:59.730 --> 01:13:03.060
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they call them to let the</v>
<v Speaker 2>theme because of the rumors.</v>

1334
01:13:03.061 --> 01:13:07.330
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they were called a bet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listerine and uh,</v>

1335
01:13:07.390 --> 01:13:10.170
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a hi iin and because they didn't really</v>

1336
01:13:10.171 --> 01:13:12.150
<v Speaker 2>know what the compound was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1337
01:13:13.050 --> 01:13:14.340
<v Speaker 2>And then it turned out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1338
01:13:14.341 --> 01:13:18.000
<v Speaker 2>it's actually harming anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Harming was isolated earlier.</v>

1339
01:13:18.001 --> 01:13:20.460
<v Speaker 2>So then they got their nomenclature</v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1340
01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:25.650
<v Speaker 2>There was a long period where they'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>never collected voucher specimens.</v>

1341
01:13:25.651 --> 01:13:30.360
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of this work was in some ways</v>
<v Speaker 2>useless because they forgot to collect</v>

1342
01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:33.840
<v Speaker 2>the actual plants that they did to</v>
<v Speaker 2>isolation from.</v>

1343
01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:37.560
<v Speaker 2>It got a little more rigorous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a group,</v>

1344
01:13:37.680 --> 01:13:42.680
<v Speaker 2>a couple of investigators that actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>thought to collect the plants that they</v>

1345
01:13:43.231 --> 01:13:46.770
<v Speaker 2>did the isolation with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then they could document the source.</v>

1346
01:13:46.771 --> 01:13:47.604
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1347
01:13:48.090 --> 01:13:51.300
<v Speaker 2>people think this is not important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but an ethno pharmacology.</v>

1348
01:13:51.301 --> 01:13:53.610
<v Speaker 2>It's quite important,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1349
01:13:53.670 --> 01:13:56.820
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a long time,</v>

1350
01:13:57.030 --> 01:14:00.510
<v Speaker 2>just just a side thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1351
01:14:00.511 --> 01:14:05.511
<v Speaker 2>for a long time there was a plan called</v>
<v Speaker 2>dystonia amazonic that was reputed to be</v>

1352
01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:11.530
<v Speaker 2>one of the sources of these alkaloids</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the components used to make</v>

1353
01:14:11.531 --> 01:14:16.531
<v Speaker 2>Iowasca fat got loose in the literature</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it took years to straighten this out</v>

1354
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:22.830
<v Speaker 2>because it's not true and there was no</v>
<v Speaker 2>doubt there is no voucher specimen to</v>

1355
01:14:23.111 --> 01:14:25.810
<v Speaker 2>show that this was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1356
01:14:25.811 --> 01:14:30.811
<v Speaker 2>it was not Prestoni Amazonia got so bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>that shelties actually had to publish a</v>

1357
01:14:31.721 --> 01:14:36.721
<v Speaker 2>paper that said Prestoni Amazonia</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazonian Hallucinogen or not turns out</v>

1358
01:14:38.770 --> 01:14:40.500
<v Speaker 2>not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1359
01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:45.840
<v Speaker 2>so you have to be aware of bad</v>
<v Speaker 2>documentation if you're going to collect</v>

1360
01:14:46.811 --> 01:14:48.460
<v Speaker 2>plants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>know what you're collecting.</v>

1361
01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:53.260
<v Speaker 2>So the chemists that might come along</v>
<v Speaker 2>and work with that can refer back to it,</v>

1362
01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:55.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise you,</v>

1363
01:14:56.680 --> 01:15:01.680
<v Speaker 2>it's just good science and chemists</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think in terms of the Botany Bay,</v>

1364
01:15:02.421 --> 01:15:05.890
<v Speaker 2>they just have something there and</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to isolate something from it.</v>

1365
01:15:05.891 --> 01:15:09.190
<v Speaker 2>But you've got to be what it helps to</v>
<v Speaker 2>know what the identity of it is.</v>

1366
01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:12.340
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it seems to me that that part of the</v>

1367
01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:16.470
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Amazon jungle and are really a</v>

1368
01:15:16.510 --> 01:15:20.390
<v Speaker 2>troubling relationship with it currently</v>
<v Speaker 2>is so it,</v>

1369
01:15:20.450 --> 01:15:21.150
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1370
01:15:21.150 --> 01:15:25.030
<v Speaker 2>it's so analogous to the way human</v>
<v Speaker 2>beings are kind of interfacing with the</v>

1371
01:15:25.031 --> 01:15:26.590
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that's a good way to look at it</v>

1372
01:15:26.591 --> 01:15:30.310
<v Speaker 2>there because there's so many different</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful things that they're learning</v>

1373
01:15:30.311 --> 01:15:34.990
<v Speaker 2>about this one area while people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>chopping it down left and right and</v>

1374
01:15:34.991 --> 01:15:38.620
<v Speaker 2>slashing and burning and making room for</v>
<v Speaker 2>cattle grazing and all this other crazy</v>

1375
01:15:38.621 --> 01:15:40.090
<v Speaker 2>shit that's going on down there.</v>

1376
01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:43.930
<v Speaker 2>While you know there's so much to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>learned still.</v>

1377
01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:47.680
<v Speaker 2>Well yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there is a Mrs. This is a good</v>

1378
01:15:47.681 --> 01:15:49.650
<v Speaker 2>illustration of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1379
01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:52.990
<v Speaker 2>our sort of penny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>penny wise and pound foolish.</v>

1380
01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.310
<v Speaker 2>Less about these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are literally trillions of dollars</v>

1381
01:15:57.311 --> 01:16:00.910
<v Speaker 2>if you just want to look at it in terms</v>
<v Speaker 2>of dollars and cents,</v>

1382
01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:05.680
<v Speaker 2>which is not the best way to look at it</v>
<v Speaker 2>because after all this ecosystem,</v>

1383
01:16:05.681 --> 01:16:08.590
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the burning of the rain forest,</v>

1384
01:16:08.591 --> 01:16:13.591
<v Speaker 2>it's about 30 percent of human global</v>
<v Speaker 2>greenhouse gas emissions.</v>

1385
01:16:14.051 --> 01:16:17.740
<v Speaker 2>If you could just stop burning down the</v>
<v Speaker 2>data for us.</v>

1386
01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:19.810
<v Speaker 2>Thirty percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 percent,</v>

1387
01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:21.400
<v Speaker 2>they figure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1388
01:16:21.610 --> 01:16:25.600
<v Speaker 2>But then on the other side of economics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there have been assessments,</v>

1389
01:16:25.601 --> 01:16:26.650
<v Speaker 2>how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what w,</v>

1390
01:16:26.690 --> 01:16:29.470
<v Speaker 2>w,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what use do you make of the Amazonian</v>

1391
01:16:29.471 --> 01:16:32.320
<v Speaker 2>biome to maximize its value?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1392
01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:36.550
<v Speaker 2>If you do cattle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's worth so much per hectare if you do</v>

1393
01:16:36.950 --> 01:16:38.000
<v Speaker 2>a woods.</v>

1394
01:16:38.770 --> 01:16:39.581
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1395
01:16:39.581 --> 01:16:42.160
<v Speaker 2>it's a big issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the big issue.</v>

1396
01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:46.300
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is,</v>

1397
01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:53.070
<v Speaker 2>in terms of undiscovered potentially</v>
<v Speaker 2>undiscovered blockbuster drugs,</v>

1398
01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:58.980
<v Speaker 2>there's probably at least a trillion</v>
<v Speaker 2>dollars worth of undiscovered drugs in</v>

1399
01:16:59.141 --> 01:17:02.410
<v Speaker 2>the Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which will of course never be discovered</v>

1400
01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:05.740
<v Speaker 2>because we're going to wreck it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're already busy.</v>

1401
01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:10.760
<v Speaker 2>Recommend insane amounts of species of</v>
<v Speaker 2>plants in the Amazon has 80,000 species.</v>

1402
01:17:13.690 --> 01:17:17.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's about 250,000 species of</v>

1403
01:17:17.511 --> 01:17:21.830
<v Speaker 2>plants overall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>always revising this number and they</v>

1404
01:17:21.831 --> 01:17:26.831
<v Speaker 2>always seem to revise it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But between 250 to 300,000 species of so</v>

1405
01:17:27.351 --> 01:17:30.340
<v Speaker 2>called higher plants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1406
01:17:30.410 --> 01:17:33.500
<v Speaker 2>in the Amazon it's one of the most bio</v>
<v Speaker 2>diverse region,</v>

1407
01:17:33.510 --> 01:17:36.290
<v Speaker 2>about 80,000 species.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1408
01:17:36.291 --> 01:17:38.960
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of these,</v>

1409
01:17:38.961 --> 01:17:42.880
<v Speaker 2>less than 10 percent of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even close to 10 percent of this,</v>

1410
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:47.950
<v Speaker 2>this incredible molecular and bio and</v>
<v Speaker 2>biological diversity has been looked at</v>

1411
01:17:51.830 --> 01:17:54.470
<v Speaker 2>as potential sources of new medicines.</v>

1412
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:57.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a whole area of folk</v>

1413
01:17:57.261 --> 01:18:01.880
<v Speaker 2>medicine and folk knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to systematically look through these</v>

1414
01:18:01.881 --> 01:18:06.350
<v Speaker 2>species and isolate things of interest</v>
<v Speaker 2>hasn't been done.</v>

1415
01:18:06.520 --> 01:18:07.610
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very.</v>

1416
01:18:07.611 --> 01:18:09.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been going on for years.</v>

1417
01:18:09.321 --> 01:18:11.900
<v Speaker 2>There's been a lot of work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not really touching.</v>

1418
01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:17.210
<v Speaker 2>A big proportion of</v>
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical companies are not</v>

1419
01:18:17.211 --> 01:18:19.130
<v Speaker 2>interested in this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1420
01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:21.710
<v Speaker 2>interestingly enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to</v>

1421
01:18:23.410 --> 01:18:26.330
<v Speaker 2>know their corporations and despite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1422
01:18:26.331 --> 01:18:29.750
<v Speaker 2>they tell you they're finding new</v>
<v Speaker 2>medicines that will cure people and help</v>

1423
01:18:29.751 --> 01:18:31.700
<v Speaker 2>people to a certain extent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>

1424
01:18:31.701 --> 01:18:33.860
<v Speaker 2>But remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bottom line is profit.</v>

1425
01:18:34.550 --> 01:18:36.830
<v Speaker 2>They want to own everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1426
01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:41.860
<v Speaker 2>they don't want to share intellectual</v>
<v Speaker 2>property with the savages down there</v>

1427
01:18:43.461 --> 01:18:46.010
<v Speaker 2>that are the stewards of this knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1428
01:18:46.011 --> 01:18:49.010
<v Speaker 2>why should we let these people have any</v>
<v Speaker 2>part of it?</v>

1429
01:18:49.011 --> 01:18:52.370
<v Speaker 2>So they want to make everything</v>
<v Speaker 2>synthetically.</v>

1430
01:18:52.370 --> 01:18:56.390
<v Speaker 2>They want it all to come out of vats</v>
<v Speaker 2>their laboratories.</v>

1431
01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:59.600
<v Speaker 2>But it's totally wrong approach because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1432
01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:04.960
<v Speaker 2>the frequency of compounds that make it</v>
<v Speaker 2>from discovery to the clinic are very,</v>

1433
01:19:05.841 --> 01:19:09.770
<v Speaker 2>is very low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when they abandoned natural products</v>

1434
01:19:09.771 --> 01:19:14.771
<v Speaker 2>about 25 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the frequency of drug discovery,</v>

1435
01:19:14.871 --> 01:19:18.470
<v Speaker 2>that pharmaceutical discovery pipeline</v>
<v Speaker 2>as they call it,</v>

1436
01:19:18.890 --> 01:19:23.890
<v Speaker 2>dried up and it took a long time for</v>
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceutical industry to realize,</v>

1437
01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:28.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially we threw the baby out with</v>

1438
01:19:28.191 --> 01:19:31.700
<v Speaker 2>the bathwater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to go back to natural products</v>

1439
01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:35.180
<v Speaker 2>because that's where you find the</v>
<v Speaker 2>molecular diversity,</v>

1440
01:19:35.181 --> 01:19:38.750
<v Speaker 2>the scaffolds done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which we can build these drugs,</v>

1441
01:19:38.751 --> 01:19:39.291
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1442
01:19:39.291 --> 01:19:44.240
<v Speaker 2>you think of the complex molecules that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you find in nature,</v>

1443
01:19:44.990 --> 01:19:46.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it may,</v>

1444
01:19:46.190 --> 01:19:48.740
<v Speaker 2>that may not be what makes it to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>clinic,</v>

1445
01:19:48.770 --> 01:19:51.320
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It may be a derivative of that or an</v>

1446
01:19:51.321 --> 01:19:54.590
<v Speaker 2>analog of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's still the plants that give you</v>

1447
01:19:54.591 --> 01:19:56.630
<v Speaker 2>the ideas for the structure.</v>

1448
01:19:57.620 --> 01:20:02.390
<v Speaker 2>If you can follow me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that you're gonna grow this</v>

1449
01:20:02.570 --> 01:20:07.570
<v Speaker 2>rain forest tree in plantations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you can go and isolate a compound,</v>

1450
01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:12.220
<v Speaker 2>determine the structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then you can probably synthesize and</v>

1451
01:20:12.221 --> 01:20:14.850
<v Speaker 2>the analog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the idea comes from nature.</v>

1452
01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:18.720
<v Speaker 2>And this isn't part of the problem in</v>
<v Speaker 2>that isolating one individual compound</v>

1453
01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:23.040
<v Speaker 2>from a plant that might have multiple</v>
<v Speaker 2>compounds that work synergistically.</v>

1454
01:20:23.220 --> 01:20:24.900
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's another difference,</v>

1455
01:20:24.901 --> 01:20:25.730
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1456
01:20:25.730 --> 01:20:26.880
<v Speaker 2>I guess the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1457
01:20:27.450 --> 01:20:31.260
<v Speaker 2>the FDA and just the whole drug</v>
<v Speaker 2>discovery process,</v>

1458
01:20:31.261 --> 01:20:35.280
<v Speaker 2>they like single compounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>magic bullets.</v>

1459
01:20:35.330 --> 01:20:40.330
<v Speaker 2>They like the synthetic compounds that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is completely define molecularly and we</v>

1460
01:20:41.941 --> 01:20:44.130
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't like these all these other</v>

1461
01:20:44.610 --> 01:20:47.340
<v Speaker 2>related compounds like Marinol for</v>
<v Speaker 2>instance,</v>

1462
01:20:47.341 --> 01:20:48.690
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Synthetic thc,</v>

1463
01:20:48.691 --> 01:20:53.691
<v Speaker 2>which is not nearly as pleasant for</v>
<v Speaker 2>people who have cancer or glaucoma or</v>

1464
01:20:54.271 --> 01:20:57.180
<v Speaker 2>any host of very good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very good example.</v>

1465
01:20:57.181 --> 01:20:59.610
<v Speaker 2>Maryknoll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does what it does,</v>

1466
01:20:59.611 --> 01:21:04.170
<v Speaker 2>but the multicomponent preparations of</v>
<v Speaker 2>cannabis are much more effective.</v>

1467
01:21:04.290 --> 01:21:09.290
<v Speaker 2>That's true of almost all herbal</v>
<v Speaker 2>medicine now when they isolate thc,</v>

1468
01:21:10.200 --> 01:21:12.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of how many different</v>

1469
01:21:12.031 --> 01:21:12.940
<v Speaker 2>cannabinoids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1470
01:21:13.890 --> 01:21:18.330
<v Speaker 2>I think there's about 400 different</v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of cannabinoids in cannabis.</v>

1471
01:21:18.990 --> 01:21:23.490
<v Speaker 2>So when you're getting THC,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting one for</v>

1472
01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:27.810
<v Speaker 2>$400.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lot of other things in cannabis as well.</v>

1473
01:21:27.811 --> 01:21:31.740
<v Speaker 2>But I believe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember reading there were about 400</v>

1474
01:21:31.741 --> 01:21:35.280
<v Speaker 2>kinds of chemicals and cannabis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So good example.</v>

1475
01:21:35.281 --> 01:21:39.690
<v Speaker 2>Incredibly complex plant chemically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1476
01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:41.820
<v Speaker 2>and as they all are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's,</v>

1477
01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:44.670
<v Speaker 2>that's a good example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never taken Marinol,</v>

1478
01:21:44.671 --> 01:21:49.080
<v Speaker 2>but everyone that I know that has said</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a pale imitation of what</v>

1479
01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:50.850
<v Speaker 2>cannabis gives you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1480
01:21:50.970 --> 01:21:55.970
<v Speaker 2>Well if it's for one particular for one</v>
<v Speaker 2>particular use,</v>

1481
01:21:57.691 --> 01:22:00.050
<v Speaker 2>which is what the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's pain,</v>

1482
01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:01.740
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it's used for?</v>

1483
01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:04.950
<v Speaker 2>But even then the people that take it</v>
<v Speaker 2>for that,</v>

1484
01:22:04.951 --> 01:22:07.410
<v Speaker 2>I've said that it's not nearly as</v>
<v Speaker 2>effective as just.</v>

1485
01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:12.850
<v Speaker 2>This is a good example of the sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>cognitive dissonance of,</v>

1486
01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:17.960
<v Speaker 2>of the FDA and the whole regulatory</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing because for years the FDA has been</v>

1487
01:22:18.301 --> 01:22:18.901
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1488
01:22:18.901 --> 01:22:23.100
<v Speaker 2>cannabis has no medical use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no recognize medical use.</v>

1489
01:22:23.490 --> 01:22:26.370
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is this one drug that the FDA</v>

1490
01:22:26.371 --> 01:22:31.320
<v Speaker 2>has approved Marinol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has some small amount of the</v>

1491
01:22:31.530 --> 01:22:35.460
<v Speaker 2>therapeutic use of cannabis does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just so incredible with so much</v>

1492
01:22:35.461 --> 01:22:38.940
<v Speaker 2>information available today that they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>making such poor choices in that regard</v>

1493
01:22:38.941 --> 01:22:43.320
<v Speaker 2>that someone can't step up and logically</v>
<v Speaker 2>address this thing and say,</v>

1494
01:22:43.321 --> 01:22:43.790
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're.</v>

1495
01:22:43.790 --> 01:22:47.730
<v Speaker 2>You're getting a fraction of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>benefits of this just because of this</v>

1496
01:22:48.030 --> 01:22:50.970
<v Speaker 2>bizarre need that human beings have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>patent things,</v>

1497
01:22:51.150 --> 01:22:52.460
<v Speaker 2>to own things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1498
01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:55.260
<v Speaker 2>And it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the plants can't be patented and they</v>

1499
01:22:55.261 --> 01:22:57.390
<v Speaker 2>can be formulations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cam,</v>

1500
01:22:57.930 --> 01:22:59.100
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1501
01:22:59.101 --> 01:23:00.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1502
01:23:00.660 --> 01:23:05.660
<v Speaker 2>gw pharmaceuticals which has brought up</v>
<v Speaker 2>sativas sits standardized a cannabis</v>

1503
01:23:08.861 --> 01:23:12.280
<v Speaker 2>preparation that you take orally as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>mouth spray.</v>

1504
01:23:12.850 --> 01:23:15.610
<v Speaker 2>So it's a natural product.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's patented,</v>

1505
01:23:15.700 --> 01:23:19.390
<v Speaker 2>it has all the cannabinoids are well</v>
<v Speaker 2>characterized.</v>

1506
01:23:19.391 --> 01:23:24.391
<v Speaker 2>It's essentially a standardized extract.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that sort of represents where this is</v>

1507
01:23:25.361 --> 01:23:27.160
<v Speaker 2>going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's a positive.</v>

1508
01:23:27.250 --> 01:23:28.960
<v Speaker 2>That's a positive branch of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1509
01:23:29.620 --> 01:23:32.620
<v Speaker 2>That's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That more reflects what cannibus should</v>

1510
01:23:32.621 --> 01:23:35.320
<v Speaker 2>be as a medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so it's essentially all the</v>

1511
01:23:35.321 --> 01:23:38.920
<v Speaker 2>properties of cannabis and what they've</v>
<v Speaker 2>patented is the formulization,</v>

1512
01:23:38.921 --> 01:23:40.990
<v Speaker 2>is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've had that the formulation?</v>

1513
01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:43.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And probably the use as well.</v>

1514
01:23:43.241 --> 01:23:46.420
<v Speaker 2>That's another way you can get patents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how is that formulation?</v>

1515
01:23:46.421 --> 01:23:49.690
<v Speaker 2>You need to know that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't tell you.</v>

1516
01:23:49.750 --> 01:23:54.750
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an oral aerosol sprays.</v>

1517
01:23:55.181 --> 01:23:58.950
<v Speaker 2>So there's issues that come up with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that it?</v>

1518
01:23:59.050 --> 01:24:02.230
<v Speaker 2>That's a company called jumbo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Makes us spray.</v>

1519
01:24:02.650 --> 01:24:03.940
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1520
01:24:04.280 --> 01:24:05.350
<v Speaker 2>it's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1521
01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:07.750
<v Speaker 2>it's similar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's similar to that.</v>

1522
01:24:07.990 --> 01:24:09.740
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1523
01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:14.560
<v Speaker 2>it's an oral,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an oral aerosol and insurance.</v>

1524
01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:17.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well standardized in terms of what</v>

1525
01:24:17.051 --> 01:24:21.010
<v Speaker 2>cannabis cannabinoids are in there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they brought it out initially</v>

1526
01:24:21.011 --> 01:24:26.011
<v Speaker 2>for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>multiple sclerosis that was the</v>

1527
01:24:26.110 --> 01:24:30.370
<v Speaker 2>treatment and then for seizures and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're gradually expanding,</v>

1528
01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:31.590
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1529
01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:35.890
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting how marijuana has gone</v>
<v Speaker 2>from,</v>

1530
01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:38.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sort of reviled drug of abuse to</v>

1531
01:24:38.951 --> 01:24:41.860
<v Speaker 2>now it's the medicine of the future.</v>

1532
01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:45.160
<v Speaker 2>That's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1533
01:24:45.161 --> 01:24:46.280
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>

1534
01:24:46.281 --> 01:24:48.070
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it does have a lot of</v>

1535
01:24:48.071 --> 01:24:51.070
<v Speaker 2>applications and why it should be</v>
<v Speaker 2>illegal.</v>

1536
01:24:51.071 --> 01:24:54.520
<v Speaker 2>There's no reason for this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1537
01:24:54.970 --> 01:24:58.600
<v Speaker 2>but obviously there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's in someone's interest to keep it</v>

1538
01:24:58.601 --> 01:25:00.850
<v Speaker 2>illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that would be my only concern with</v>

1539
01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:06.780
<v Speaker 2>this patented formula formula that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've sort of figured out is that</v>

1540
01:25:07.901 --> 01:25:12.640
<v Speaker 2>other people can't make a formula as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well as like in patenting.</v>

1541
01:25:12.670 --> 01:25:15.040
<v Speaker 2>Do they own the process?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what if it's a very obvious</v>

1542
01:25:15.041 --> 01:25:15.874
<v Speaker 2>process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1543
01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:18.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the IOWASCA process.</v>

1544
01:25:18.910 --> 01:25:23.080
<v Speaker 2>It's a very obvious process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The monoamine oxidase inhibitor along</v>

1545
01:25:23.081 --> 01:25:25.540
<v Speaker 2>with the plant that contains dmt boiled</v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

1546
01:25:25.541 --> 01:25:28.180
<v Speaker 2>everybody knows how to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If somebody figures out a way how to</v>

1547
01:25:28.181 --> 01:25:29.350
<v Speaker 2>patent that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does that,</v>

1548
01:25:29.740 --> 01:25:33.430
<v Speaker 2>does that become a real problem?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that they own the rights to</v>

1549
01:25:33.431 --> 01:25:35.080
<v Speaker 2>something that's been around forever?</v>

1550
01:25:35.110 --> 01:25:37.840
<v Speaker 2>It does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does become a problem.</v>

1551
01:25:37.990 --> 01:25:38.950
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1552
01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:42.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you say,</v>

1553
01:25:42.251 --> 01:25:45.330
<v Speaker 2>with something like that where,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1554
01:25:45.340 --> 01:25:49.000
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty obvious how you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that complicated.</v>

1555
01:25:49.001 --> 01:25:52.060
<v Speaker 2>There's no innovative technology there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

1556
01:25:52.420 --> 01:25:55.600
<v Speaker 2>there's no art.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no art of innovation,</v>

1557
01:25:55.601 --> 01:26:00.601
<v Speaker 2>which is what would make it patentable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were attempts to patent Iowasca a</v>

1558
01:26:01.270 --> 01:26:03.860
<v Speaker 2>few years ago and it got to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1559
01:26:03.870 --> 01:26:08.870
<v Speaker 2>what actually it was patented and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>delegation of indigenous healers from</v>

1560
01:26:09.771 --> 01:26:10.820
<v Speaker 2>Ecuador,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Colombia,</v>

1561
01:26:10.821 --> 01:26:15.821
<v Speaker 2>and Peru came to the US patent office</v>
<v Speaker 2>and petitioned against this and said,</v>

1562
01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:20.120
<v Speaker 2>we've been using this medicine for</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of years.</v>

1563
01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:21.850
<v Speaker 2>How is it that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1564
01:26:21.860 --> 01:26:26.240
<v Speaker 2>it was a guy named Lauren Miller who</v>
<v Speaker 2>really didn't know what he was doing.</v>

1565
01:26:26.570 --> 01:26:30.290
<v Speaker 2>I forget what his company was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was when I was still doing my</v>

1566
01:26:30.291 --> 01:26:34.310
<v Speaker 2>postdoc at Nih.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this was like mid eighties.</v>

1567
01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:38.960
<v Speaker 2>He tried to patent that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then what it turned out was it was a</v>

1568
01:26:38.961 --> 01:26:41.180
<v Speaker 2>completely specious patent.</v>

1569
01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:46.800
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a patent on a particular strain</v>

1570
01:26:46.881 --> 01:26:51.440
<v Speaker 2>of banisteriopsis that he collected that</v>
<v Speaker 2>had an anomalous flower color,</v>

1571
01:26:51.441 --> 01:26:54.710
<v Speaker 2>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was the basis of the patent</v>

1572
01:26:54.711 --> 01:26:57.800
<v Speaker 2>will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's absurd because flower color is</v>

1573
01:26:58.010 --> 01:26:59.990
<v Speaker 2>highly variable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was,</v>

1574
01:27:00.290 --> 01:27:04.070
<v Speaker 2>it was a useless patent in every</v>
<v Speaker 2>respect.</v>

1575
01:27:04.430 --> 01:27:08.540
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Patent Ofa Office overturn the</v>

1576
01:27:08.541 --> 01:27:13.541
<v Speaker 2>patent as they well should have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I believe it was reinstated for</v>

1577
01:27:14.571 --> 01:27:16.880
<v Speaker 2>some reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't really followed this up,</v>

1578
01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:22.480
<v Speaker 2>but I think by that time everyone kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of came to the conclusion that it was,</v>

1579
01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:26.720
<v Speaker 2>it was absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was no reason to do it and he</v>

1580
01:27:26.721 --> 01:27:29.420
<v Speaker 2>didn't really have the resources to</v>
<v Speaker 2>develop it.</v>

1581
01:27:29.421 --> 01:27:31.510
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he was not a,</v>

1582
01:27:31.511 --> 01:27:34.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he lost a lot of respect because it's</v>

1583
01:27:34.491 --> 01:27:39.491
<v Speaker 2>not so much that you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the intellectual property thing</v>

1584
01:27:39.801 --> 01:27:41.450
<v Speaker 2>is the real issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1585
01:27:41.451 --> 01:27:43.640
<v Speaker 2>if you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's why the pharmaceutical</v>

1586
01:27:43.641 --> 01:27:48.290
<v Speaker 2>companies want to stay away from</v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional medicines by and large</v>

1587
01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:51.240
<v Speaker 2>because it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1588
01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:54.410
<v Speaker 2>the enthesis people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are the stewards of the knowledge.</v>

1589
01:27:54.420 --> 01:27:57.290
<v Speaker 2>They know how to use the plant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They maintain the plant,</v>

1590
01:27:57.410 --> 01:27:59.600
<v Speaker 2>their habitat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1591
01:27:59.601 --> 01:28:04.601
<v Speaker 2>it's where the plant is found.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so they rightly should have a place</v>

1592
01:28:06.771 --> 01:28:08.030
<v Speaker 2>at the table,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1593
01:28:08.031 --> 01:28:11.240
<v Speaker 2>if you're going to commercialize this</v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional medicine,</v>

1594
01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:15.860
<v Speaker 2>they should get something back isn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>traditionally we've been ripping things</v>

1595
01:28:15.861 --> 01:28:19.700
<v Speaker 2>off from indigenous people for a long</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

1596
01:28:19.701 --> 01:28:21.800
<v Speaker 2>It's called bio piracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1597
01:28:21.830 --> 01:28:26.830
<v Speaker 2>And that's how they operate generally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's an issue,</v>

1598
01:28:27.470 --> 01:28:30.440
<v Speaker 2>but there are ways to address that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just basically,</v>

1599
01:28:31.610 --> 01:28:34.180
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come to terms with it and acknowledge</v>

1600
01:28:34.190 --> 01:28:39.190
<v Speaker 2>that their knowledge does count for</v>
<v Speaker 2>something and they should have,</v>

1601
01:28:39.530 --> 01:28:42.260
<v Speaker 2>they should have a part of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the proceeds.</v>

1602
01:28:42.261 --> 01:28:45.980
<v Speaker 2>If you build a map,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you make a billion dollar drug out of</v>

1603
01:28:45.981 --> 01:28:47.810
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should be able to give something</v>

1604
01:28:47.811 --> 01:28:50.870
<v Speaker 2>back to indigenous people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know.</v>

1605
01:28:50.930 --> 01:28:54.560
<v Speaker 2>So it's complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It does seem complicated.</v>

1606
01:28:54.561 --> 01:28:58.520
<v Speaker 2>It also seems like when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when everything becomes commercial,</v>

1607
01:28:59.060 --> 01:29:02.130
<v Speaker 2>it becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it like when you look at the idea</v>

1608
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:04.110
<v Speaker 1>that pharmaceutical drug companies at</v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

1609
01:29:04.530 --> 01:29:09.530
<v Speaker 1>when you look at a corporation and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>think of this idea of infinite growth</v>

1610
01:29:09.631 --> 01:29:12.240
<v Speaker 1>and this is what they're subscribing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the constant trying to make more and</v>

1611
01:29:12.241 --> 01:29:17.130
<v Speaker 1>more money and then you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think about compounds and compounds</v>

1612
01:29:17.131 --> 01:29:21.270
<v Speaker 1>being legal and them trying to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out a way to market these things.</v>

1613
01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:25.380
<v Speaker 1>It seems to become.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be a big issue that we're</v>

1614
01:29:25.381 --> 01:29:28.590
<v Speaker 1>relying on that at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like the tail of the</v>

1615
01:29:28.591 --> 01:29:31.380
<v Speaker 1>Scorpion and the frog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Frog says,</v>

1616
01:29:31.410 --> 01:29:32.760
<v Speaker 1>tells the Scorpion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

1617
01:29:32.761 --> 01:29:36.480
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you a ride across the river,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do me a favor and don't sting me</v>

1618
01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:39.690
<v Speaker 1>because you deal with both drowned and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then halfway through the Scorpion</v>

1619
01:29:39.691 --> 01:29:40.710
<v Speaker 1>stings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the frog goes,</v>

1620
01:29:40.711 --> 01:29:41.970
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the Scorpion goes,</v>

1621
01:29:41.971 --> 01:29:43.020
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's my nature.</v>

1622
01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:48.690
<v Speaker 1>It seems like the nature of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations is just to make money.</v>

1623
01:29:48.690 --> 01:29:53.690
<v Speaker 1>So relying on them to bring these</v>
<v Speaker 1>intense psychedelic compounds to the</v>

1624
01:29:54.241 --> 01:29:57.660
<v Speaker 1>market or to even saying the market's</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible word,</v>

1625
01:29:58.080 --> 01:30:01.340
<v Speaker 1>to just bring them to daily use or bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>them to the.</v>

1626
01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:06.720
<v Speaker 1>Making them free to use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the corporations,</v>

1627
01:30:07.220 --> 01:30:08.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you say,</v>

1628
01:30:08.851 --> 01:30:12.660
<v Speaker 1>their main job as they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as they see it though,</v>

1629
01:30:12.661 --> 01:30:16.080
<v Speaker 1>they don't say so in public is basically</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll make money,</v>

1630
01:30:16.081 --> 01:30:18.590
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to patent these compounds and making</v>

1631
01:30:18.591 --> 01:30:22.200
<v Speaker 1>money and make more money every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the best way to know there's no</v>

1632
01:30:22.201 --> 01:30:24.240
<v Speaker 1>revenue model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelics,</v>

1633
01:30:24.241 --> 01:30:29.220
<v Speaker 1>there's no way for them to make money</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to that mall is a way to not</v>

1634
01:30:29.221 --> 01:30:31.140
<v Speaker 1>make money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't give that guy who's got a leaf</v>

1635
01:30:31.141 --> 01:30:32.640
<v Speaker 1>over his dick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a billion dollars,</v>

1636
01:30:33.260 --> 01:30:35.520
<v Speaker 1>that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been happy shooting arrows at</v>

1637
01:30:35.521 --> 01:30:37.820
<v Speaker 1>monkeys for 10,000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of.</v>

1638
01:30:38.380 --> 01:30:40.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just not.</v>

1639
01:30:40.251 --> 01:30:42.330
<v Speaker 1>So they're not going to do that if they</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to.</v>

1640
01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:45.450
<v Speaker 1>Well they won't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1641
01:30:45.451 --> 01:30:49.200
<v Speaker 1>these are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want these psychedelics if you use</v>

1642
01:30:49.201 --> 01:30:52.950
<v Speaker 1>them therapeutically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are things you might take a few</v>

1643
01:30:52.951 --> 01:30:56.550
<v Speaker 1>times in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want drugs you take four times a</v>

1644
01:30:56.551 --> 01:31:00.780
<v Speaker 1>day for the rest of your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the revenue model and the revenue</v>

1645
01:31:00.781 --> 01:31:03.850
<v Speaker 1>model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there is one with psychedelics is not</v>

1646
01:31:03.870 --> 01:31:07.770
<v Speaker 1>that because they have to be used in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>context,</v>

1647
01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:09.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>set and setting,</v>

1648
01:31:09.751 --> 01:31:11.610
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The revenue model,</v>

1649
01:31:11.611 --> 01:31:15.120
<v Speaker 1>if there is one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to have centers to have places you</v>

1650
01:31:15.121 --> 01:31:18.780
<v Speaker 1>can go and take psychedelics in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>controlled setting.</v>

1651
01:31:19.410 --> 01:31:22.160
<v Speaker 1>They won't look like clinics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll look like spa was,</v>

1652
01:31:22.450 --> 01:31:23.283
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1653
01:31:23.940 --> 01:31:26.910
<v Speaker 1>take the family for a weekend and have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice,</v>

1654
01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:30.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>silicide when vacation while you're busy</v>

1655
01:31:30.811 --> 01:31:33.600
<v Speaker 1>getting your massages and doing yoga and</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

1656
01:31:33.601 --> 01:31:38.601
<v Speaker 1>That's how it's gonna work if it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's allowed to go forward.</v>

1657
01:31:39.950 --> 01:31:42.270
<v Speaker 1>That's the model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1658
01:31:44.130 --> 01:31:44.941
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1659
01:31:44.941 --> 01:31:46.080
<v Speaker 1>we'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1660
01:31:47.340 --> 01:31:52.340
<v Speaker 1>I've often said the very idea that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>could patent or prohibit a plant is</v>

1661
01:31:57.390 --> 01:31:58.890
<v Speaker 1>absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is absurd.</v>

1662
01:31:59.260 --> 01:32:00.850
<v Speaker 1>Especially one that's nontoxic.</v>

1663
01:32:00.940 --> 01:32:04.620
<v Speaker 2>What is not patented is prohibited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1664
01:32:04.650 --> 01:32:07.870
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the way they approach in most</v>

1665
01:32:07.871 --> 01:32:10.060
<v Speaker 2>circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which were real weird,</v>

1666
01:32:10.061 --> 01:32:13.780
<v Speaker 2>is that we give these caveats to</v>
<v Speaker 2>religions.</v>

1667
01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:18.700
<v Speaker 2>Like that's what's going on now with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iowasca is that there are some companies</v>

1668
01:32:18.701 --> 01:32:22.150
<v Speaker 2>that have had an exemption through the</v>
<v Speaker 2>supreme court.</v>

1669
01:32:22.151 --> 01:32:23.770
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't say companies,</v>

1670
01:32:23.771 --> 01:32:25.570
<v Speaker 2>but it basically that's what they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are churches,</v>

1671
01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:29.230
<v Speaker 2>there are churches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really just another way of</v>

1672
01:32:29.231 --> 01:32:33.970
<v Speaker 2>saying a company out there to their</v>
<v Speaker 2>institution.</v>

1673
01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:38.650
<v Speaker 2>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and now people are beginning to sort of</v>

1674
01:32:38.770 --> 01:32:40.960
<v Speaker 2>recognize this or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or ask the question,</v>

1675
01:32:41.350 --> 01:32:43.600
<v Speaker 2>so you've got your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got the UDP,</v>

1676
01:32:43.690 --> 01:32:48.690
<v Speaker 2>which is one of these churches that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're the ones that took their case</v>

1677
01:32:49.331 --> 01:32:54.331
<v Speaker 2>all the way to the Supreme Court and got</v>
<v Speaker 2>approved unanimously under actually the</v>

1678
01:32:55.001 --> 01:32:59.980
<v Speaker 2>first case that John Roberts decided</v>
<v Speaker 2>after he became chief justice.</v>

1679
01:32:59.981 --> 01:33:04.981
<v Speaker 2>So very conservative court that</v>
<v Speaker 2>unanimously ruled that yes,</v>

1680
01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:08.260
<v Speaker 2>the udv is a real religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is fascinating.</v>

1681
01:33:08.290 --> 01:33:11.290
<v Speaker 2>They have the right to use it well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It clearly is a real religion.</v>

1682
01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:13.810
<v Speaker 2>It is a real religious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just fascinating that a conservative</v>

1683
01:33:13.811 --> 01:33:16.690
<v Speaker 2>court would have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would almost be boxed into doing that</v>

1684
01:33:16.691 --> 01:33:19.060
<v Speaker 2>because of their views on Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>

1685
01:33:19.150 --> 01:33:21.190
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't not do it.</v>

1686
01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:26.080
<v Speaker 2>And then the central dimey same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't have to go all the way,</v>

1687
01:33:26.081 --> 01:33:30.160
<v Speaker 2>but essentially they have the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>approval and they're piggybacking on</v>

1688
01:33:30.161 --> 01:33:33.040
<v Speaker 2>this and it's their Christian based</v>
<v Speaker 2>religions as well.</v>

1689
01:33:33.090 --> 01:33:35.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they're Christian race religion.</v>

1690
01:33:35.171 --> 01:33:38.020
<v Speaker 2>So now the question is when you go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peru,</v>

1691
01:33:38.140 --> 01:33:40.420
<v Speaker 2>there's Iowasca.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's used.</v>

1692
01:33:40.660 --> 01:33:45.660
<v Speaker 2>It's not as institutionalized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of idiosyncratic.</v>

1693
01:33:46.271 --> 01:33:48.430
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got these practitioners that the</v>

1694
01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:52.840
<v Speaker 2>traditionals called vegetal small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no institution,</v>

1695
01:33:52.841 --> 01:33:54.940
<v Speaker 2>there's no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no doctrine.</v>

1696
01:33:54.941 --> 01:33:57.250
<v Speaker 2>There's no hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no.</v>

1697
01:33:57.310 --> 01:34:01.900
<v Speaker 2>There's just freelance practitioners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Question is,</v>

1698
01:34:02.020 --> 01:34:07.020
<v Speaker 2>is that a religious activity and should</v>
<v Speaker 2>it be protected and this is what some</v>

1699
01:34:07.690 --> 01:34:12.690
<v Speaker 2>smart lawyers are now addressing with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the use of Iowaska in the more</v>

1700
01:34:12.881 --> 01:34:14.020
<v Speaker 2>traditional way.</v>

1701
01:34:14.660 --> 01:34:19.660
<v Speaker 2>I tend to have essentially taken that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've appropriated that tradition and</v>

1702
01:34:19.811 --> 01:34:20.291
<v Speaker 2>they say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1703
01:34:20.291 --> 01:34:22.660
<v Speaker 2>we want nothing to do with these digitas</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

1704
01:34:22.980 --> 01:34:24.970
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is our religion.</v>

1705
01:34:25.090 --> 01:34:26.620
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's our sacrament.</v>

1706
01:34:26.830 --> 01:34:31.240
<v Speaker 2>They don't even.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They get upset if you even call it a</v>

1707
01:34:31.241 --> 01:34:33.730
<v Speaker 2>drug or a medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To them it's a sacrament.</v>

1708
01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:37.750
<v Speaker 2>That's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but elsewhere it isn't medicine,</v>

1709
01:34:38.620 --> 01:34:40.970
<v Speaker 2>but it is also a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1710
01:34:41.020 --> 01:34:46.020
<v Speaker 2>a religious activity of visually smell</v>
<v Speaker 2>has a spiritual aspect.</v>

1711
01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:50.230
<v Speaker 2>It should be regarded as a religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll see where that goes.</v>

1712
01:34:50.260 --> 01:34:54.430
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like with the UDV and these</v>
<v Speaker 2>other churches that what they've done is</v>

1713
01:34:54.431 --> 01:34:58.370
<v Speaker 2>they've used this scaffolding of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity as a Trojan horse</v>

1714
01:34:58.910 --> 01:35:01.610
<v Speaker 1>that's allowing this Iowasca to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>through.</v>

1715
01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:05.270
<v Speaker 1>Strassman was telling me his experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>with it,</v>

1716
01:35:05.750 --> 01:35:10.750
<v Speaker 1>with them where they were all wearing</v>
<v Speaker 1>golf shirts and they have uniforms and</v>

1717
01:35:11.260 --> 01:35:16.260
<v Speaker 1>they're taking these insane doses of</v>
<v Speaker 1>super potent Iowasca and you know,</v>

1718
01:35:17.240 --> 01:35:22.240
<v Speaker 1>and then they're all singing and singing</v>
<v Speaker 1>songs about Jesus and strassman has like</v>

1719
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:27.890
<v Speaker 1>a really like very mellow and easygoing</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

1720
01:35:27.891 --> 01:35:30.950
<v Speaker 1>Really pleasant guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was explaining how he sat down with</v>

1721
01:35:30.951 --> 01:35:32.750
<v Speaker 1>these people in the morning after all</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is over.</v>

1722
01:35:32.751 --> 01:35:34.520
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck are you people doing?</v>

1723
01:35:36.050 --> 01:35:39.200
<v Speaker 1>Browser raised and he's taking about his</v>
<v Speaker 1>trip from the night before.</v>

1724
01:35:39.380 --> 01:35:41.630
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people are taking like super</v>

1725
01:35:41.631 --> 01:35:46.160
<v Speaker 1>potent doses of IOWASCA and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>singing about Jesus with golf shirts on.</v>

1726
01:35:46.161 --> 01:35:47.630
<v Speaker 1>It's like what the F,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1727
01:35:47.631 --> 01:35:51.890
<v Speaker 1>they have like plastic folding chairs</v>
<v Speaker 1>and shit and like on furniture and it's</v>

1728
01:35:51.891 --> 01:35:53.270
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is this?</v>

1729
01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:57.830
<v Speaker 1>What it is is it's a religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a religion,</v>

1730
01:35:57.831 --> 01:35:59.300
<v Speaker 1>that's what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1731
01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:02.360
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's okay.</v>

1732
01:36:03.050 --> 01:36:05.720
<v Speaker 1>Read it away,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spread it and spread it on.</v>

1733
01:36:05.721 --> 01:36:06.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is I,</v>

1734
01:36:06.770 --> 01:36:09.860
<v Speaker 1>I worked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I haven't had much to do with central</v>

1735
01:36:09.861 --> 01:36:12.710
<v Speaker 1>Thai May.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that I just haven't had the</v>

1736
01:36:12.711 --> 01:36:16.910
<v Speaker 1>opportunity nor am I particularly</v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in going to ceremonies where</v>

1737
01:36:16.911 --> 01:36:19.990
<v Speaker 1>I am told that I have to dance the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole.</v>

1738
01:36:20.490 --> 01:36:23.690
<v Speaker 1>Not My thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know the UDP well,</v>

1739
01:36:24.210 --> 01:36:26.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we did the biomedical study with</v>

1740
01:36:26.841 --> 01:36:29.690
<v Speaker 1>them and the nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they're wonderful people.</v>

1741
01:36:29.691 --> 01:36:32.270
<v Speaker 1>They're very kind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1742
01:36:32.630 --> 01:36:35.600
<v Speaker 1>their families are good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're very nice people.</v>

1743
01:36:35.630 --> 01:36:38.070
<v Speaker 1>But I would never join.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They asked me to join.</v>

1744
01:36:38.090 --> 01:36:38.780
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1745
01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:42.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't do cults.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be happy to come drink with you</v>

1746
01:36:42.831 --> 01:36:47.690
<v Speaker 1>anytime that religion or the Groucho</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marx one said,</v>

1747
01:36:47.691 --> 01:36:50.840
<v Speaker 1>I think to paraphrase him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would never be a member of any group</v>

1748
01:36:50.841 --> 01:36:51.674
<v Speaker 1>that would have me.</v>

1749
01:36:51.940 --> 01:36:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty much what I told them.</v>

1750
01:36:54.321 --> 01:36:57.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want me heritage by nature,</v>

1751
01:36:57.921 --> 01:37:02.921
<v Speaker 1>but I'm happy to share your brew and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do make fine brood.</v>

1752
01:37:03.770 --> 01:37:07.070
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does your organization tweeted out for</v>

1753
01:37:07.071 --> 01:37:08.300
<v Speaker 1>you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'm not showing up at the</v>

1754
01:37:08.330 --> 01:37:10.610
<v Speaker 1>stockholders meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not good at joy,</v>

1755
01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:15.880
<v Speaker 1>but it seems to me with my experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>with dmt that it's so powerful and so</v>

1756
01:37:16.071 --> 01:37:19.550
<v Speaker 1>profound that I wonder if that's a way</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Christianity works.</v>

1757
01:37:19.750 --> 01:37:22.550
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this idea of Jesus and the saints</v>

1758
01:37:22.551 --> 01:37:26.150
<v Speaker 1>in Heaven and God and all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>different manifested deities,</v>

1759
01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:31.280
<v Speaker 1>like people thumb their nose at it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>say it's ridiculous and preposterous,</v>

1760
01:37:31.281 --> 01:37:36.281
<v Speaker 1>but everything on Dmt is ridiculous and</v>
<v Speaker 1>preposterous and I wonder if under the</v>

1761
01:37:36.471 --> 01:37:38.990
<v Speaker 1>guise of the UDV and they're singing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're dancing,</v>

1762
01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:44.440
<v Speaker 1>if Jesus is real in a sense that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually communicate with a thing that</v>

1763
01:37:44.451 --> 01:37:47.750
<v Speaker 1>takes the form of Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In that sense,</v>

1764
01:37:48.080 --> 01:37:49.790
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what they're seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1765
01:37:49.791 --> 01:37:54.590
<v Speaker 1>I really wonder if they're going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole idea of psychedelics for the</v>

1766
01:37:54.591 --> 01:37:56.100
<v Speaker 1>non initiated is a big</v>

1767
01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:59.700
<v Speaker 2>part of it is how you're going into the</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience set and setting and also your</v>

1768
01:37:59.701 --> 01:38:02.030
<v Speaker 2>mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also the,</v>

1769
01:38:02.170 --> 01:38:06.450
<v Speaker 2>the state of mind that you approach</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things can greatly affect your</v>

1770
01:38:06.451 --> 01:38:09.530
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hence bad trips for people that have an</v>

1771
01:38:09.540 --> 01:38:12.780
<v Speaker 2>unstable psychological state of mind or</v>
<v Speaker 2>they try to fight the experience.</v>

1772
01:38:13.110 --> 01:38:16.200
<v Speaker 2>I really wonder if these people are</v>
<v Speaker 2>embracing the,</v>

1773
01:38:16.380 --> 01:38:18.210
<v Speaker 2>all the beautiful concepts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christianity,</v>

1774
01:38:18.211 --> 01:38:19.330
<v Speaker 2>the love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1775
01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:22.440
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the family idea,</v>

1776
01:38:22.441 --> 01:38:24.090
<v Speaker 2>that blood brotherhood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1777
01:38:24.450 --> 01:38:29.400
<v Speaker 2>the idea of brothers and sisters</v>
<v Speaker 2>together in this sense of unity and love</v>

1778
01:38:29.401 --> 01:38:33.180
<v Speaker 2>of the creator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If this under this idea,</v>

1779
01:38:33.210 --> 01:38:36.900
<v Speaker 2>if Christianity is actually an effective</v>
<v Speaker 2>approach.</v>

1780
01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:38.040
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

1781
01:38:38.040 --> 01:38:40.920
<v Speaker 2>I think what your experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1782
01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:45.540
<v Speaker 2>it is not confined to Christianity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you articulated is just basically</v>

1783
01:38:45.870 --> 01:38:50.870
<v Speaker 2>kind of the characteristics of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>religious experience or spiritual</v>

1784
01:38:51.991 --> 01:38:55.830
<v Speaker 2>experience without necessarily tying it</v>
<v Speaker 2>to Christianity.</v>

1785
01:38:55.831 --> 01:38:57.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>compassion,</v>

1786
01:38:57.691 --> 01:38:59.070
<v Speaker 2>respect for each other.</v>

1787
01:38:59.670 --> 01:39:00.540
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1788
01:39:00.541 --> 01:39:02.730
<v Speaker 2>these are elements of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1789
01:39:02.740 --> 01:39:04.020
<v Speaker 2>kind of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1790
01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:06.840
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what you call a generic</v>

1791
01:39:06.841 --> 01:39:09.090
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are elements of the religious</v>

1792
01:39:09.091 --> 01:39:13.260
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The interesting thing about the UDV and</v>

1793
01:39:13.261 --> 01:39:18.261
<v Speaker 2>these other churches is that they have</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually created a structure where this</v>

1794
01:39:18.511 --> 01:39:21.960
<v Speaker 2>can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas most religions,</v>

1795
01:39:21.961 --> 01:39:26.490
<v Speaker 2>the last thing they want you to do is</v>
<v Speaker 2>have an actual religious experience.</v>

1796
01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:28.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all made.</v>

1797
01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:33.270
<v Speaker 2>It's all set up to make sure that</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't happen because it just</v>

1798
01:39:33.330 --> 01:39:37.440
<v Speaker 2>experiences are dangerous as a very</v>
<v Speaker 2>profound thing.</v>

1799
01:39:37.441 --> 01:39:40.830
<v Speaker 2>You just said that most religious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last thing they want is for you to</v>

1800
01:39:40.831 --> 01:39:44.100
<v Speaker 2>have a real religious experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's all set up to make sure that</v>

1801
01:39:44.101 --> 01:39:47.850
<v Speaker 2>doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only the priests get to have it or that</v>

1802
01:39:47.851 --> 01:39:51.240
<v Speaker 2>was the original thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then of course they don't have it</v>

1803
01:39:51.241 --> 01:39:53.450
<v Speaker 2>either because they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1804
01:39:53.520 --> 01:39:58.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's gotten a ways from that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>missing is that that they original idea</v>

1805
01:40:01.201 --> 01:40:05.100
<v Speaker 2>of the rules of Christianity might have</v>
<v Speaker 2>come from that.</v>

1806
01:40:05.340 --> 01:40:08.820
<v Speaker 2>The Moses and the burning Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these ideas that are passed on,</v>

1807
01:40:08.821 --> 01:40:11.880
<v Speaker 2>love thy neighbor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff might have been from that</v>

1808
01:40:11.881 --> 01:40:14.850
<v Speaker 2>very experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Might've been from that various that</v>

1809
01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:16.590
<v Speaker 2>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thing is,</v>

1810
01:40:17.340 --> 01:40:19.920
<v Speaker 2>and this happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not just Christianity,</v>

1811
01:40:19.921 --> 01:40:24.921
<v Speaker 2>it's like it's like any powerful</v>
<v Speaker 2>spiritual technology.</v>

1812
01:40:25.801 --> 01:40:28.080
<v Speaker 2>Anything that is numinous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1813
01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:31.320
<v Speaker 2>I talk a lot about the mysterium</v>
<v Speaker 2>tremendum,</v>

1814
01:40:31.321 --> 01:40:33.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The DMT,</v>

1815
01:40:33.301 --> 01:40:35.550
<v Speaker 2>the psychedelic experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a mysterium,</v>

1816
01:40:35.551 --> 01:40:39.570
<v Speaker 2>tremendum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that is mysterious,</v>

1817
01:40:39.660 --> 01:40:41.730
<v Speaker 2>tremendous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrifying,</v>

1818
01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:47.010
<v Speaker 2>spiritually powerful and must be</v>
<v Speaker 2>controlled,</v>

1819
01:40:47.070 --> 01:40:47.903
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1820
01:40:48.060 --> 01:40:49.440
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All those things.</v>

1821
01:40:49.441 --> 01:40:51.420
<v Speaker 2>It's too powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in these,</v>

1822
01:40:51.421 --> 01:40:55.150
<v Speaker 2>in these power structure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's always someone who says,</v>

1823
01:40:55.540 --> 01:40:59.710
<v Speaker 2>who wants to sort of put a collar around</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

1824
01:40:59.711 --> 01:41:03.030
<v Speaker 2>put a lasso around that to seize the</v>
<v Speaker 2>reins if the,</v>

1825
01:41:03.031 --> 01:41:08.031
<v Speaker 2>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a temptation to grab it and use</v>

1826
01:41:08.741 --> 01:41:12.880
<v Speaker 2>it for your own purposes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is usually a man usually.</v>

1827
01:41:12.881 --> 01:41:15.490
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if any women women don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>seem to be,</v>

1828
01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:19.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's not in built to do the</v>

1829
01:41:20.020 --> 01:41:24.340
<v Speaker 2>dominance thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's very often a male figure who</v>

1830
01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:28.510
<v Speaker 2>can take it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any spiritual technology coopt at to</v>

1831
01:41:28.511 --> 01:41:31.180
<v Speaker 2>their purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1832
01:41:31.570 --> 01:41:35.860
<v Speaker 2>which is often sex or money or power or</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of those things.</v>

1833
01:41:36.050 --> 01:41:36.960
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's always a man.</v>

1834
01:41:36.961 --> 01:41:38.660
<v Speaker 1>Now of course it's a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dammit.</v>

1835
01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:42.690
<v Speaker 1>Why do we suck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We just do,</v>

1836
01:41:42.720 --> 01:41:43.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1837
01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:49.350
<v Speaker 1>that's why there's 7 billion people</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we're sneaky and we get your</v>

1838
01:41:49.351 --> 01:41:50.300
<v Speaker 1>pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

1839
01:41:50.540 --> 01:41:53.610
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty much yet.</v>

1840
01:41:53.660 --> 01:41:56.040
<v Speaker 1>We're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't want to be like this ladies.</v>

1841
01:41:56.310 --> 01:42:00.660
<v Speaker 1>It's not our fault God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's always a man.</v>

1842
01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:02.130
<v Speaker 1>It really is always a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1843
01:42:02.150 --> 01:42:03.050
<v Speaker 1>there's no arguing with it,</v>

1844
01:42:03.110 --> 01:42:05.750
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you get this all the time,</v>

1845
01:42:05.810 --> 01:42:06.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

1846
01:42:06.900 --> 01:42:11.900
<v Speaker 2>in any kind of quote unquote spiritual</v>
<v Speaker 2>tradition that happens in the,</v>

1847
01:42:12.620 --> 01:42:14.650
<v Speaker 2>in the IOWASCA thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we know,</v>

1848
01:42:14.651 --> 01:42:18.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not uncommon to sexual abuse</v>

1849
01:42:18.650 --> 01:42:22.670
<v Speaker 1>sort of very common lately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lately more and more so you hear these</v>

1850
01:42:22.671 --> 01:42:24.690
<v Speaker 1>stories of these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

1851
01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:26.720
<v Speaker 1>my friend Amber Lyon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had it had happened to her,</v>

1852
01:42:26.721 --> 01:42:30.050
<v Speaker 1>like on one of her first experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scott was groping her and where she was</v>

1853
01:42:30.051 --> 01:42:33.260
<v Speaker 1>under and she's realizing what's going</v>
<v Speaker 1>on and just realize like,</v>

1854
01:42:33.261 --> 01:42:36.780
<v Speaker 1>this is probably how some of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people sort of like,</v>

1855
01:42:36.830 --> 01:42:39.710
<v Speaker 1>they found this technology and you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>call it technology if you want,</v>

1856
01:42:39.711 --> 01:42:42.110
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this pathway to this incredible</v>

1857
01:42:42.111 --> 01:42:44.090
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They provide it to people,</v>

1858
01:42:44.450 --> 01:42:49.130
<v Speaker 1>but they're not really much in into</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking that journey themselves really</v>

1859
01:42:49.131 --> 01:42:54.131
<v Speaker 1>into exploiting this thing for financial</v>
<v Speaker 1>gain and for power and influence.</v>

1860
01:42:54.570 --> 01:42:59.570
<v Speaker 2>That is what it's morphed into now that</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's the tourism phenomena and all</v>

1861
01:42:59.641 --> 01:43:01.290
<v Speaker 2>that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>

1862
01:43:01.890 --> 01:43:03.990
<v Speaker 2>they see it as a way to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1863
01:43:04.710 --> 01:43:08.820
<v Speaker 2>to exactly that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to power influence and money,</v>

1864
01:43:09.150 --> 01:43:11.040
<v Speaker 2>which just illustrates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

1865
01:43:11.100 --> 01:43:15.930
<v Speaker 2>it's all about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's nothing inherently good or bad</v>

1866
01:43:15.931 --> 01:43:17.610
<v Speaker 2>about these technologies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There</v>

1867
01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:22.440
<v Speaker 2>can be a wonderful thing if it's used</v>
<v Speaker 2>properly.</v>

1868
01:43:22.450 --> 01:43:25.890
<v Speaker 2>That can be a really terrible thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all about the use you make of it,</v>

1869
01:43:25.950 --> 01:43:30.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the moral dimension that comes with,</v>

1870
01:43:31.050 --> 01:43:32.760
<v Speaker 2>with how you use it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1871
01:43:32.761 --> 01:43:36.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean there are ios scarecrows that</v>
<v Speaker 2>have no,</v>

1872
01:43:36.890 --> 01:43:38.910
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say they don't listen to their</v>

1873
01:43:38.911 --> 01:43:42.390
<v Speaker 2>medicine since they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do these things,</v>

1874
01:43:42.391 --> 01:43:46.920
<v Speaker 2>they're not really absorbing the lessons</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they should be getting from the</v>

1875
01:43:46.921 --> 01:43:50.640
<v Speaker 2>medicine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Others do listen to their medicine and</v>

1876
01:43:50.650 --> 01:43:51.483
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1877
01:43:51.860 --> 01:43:52.670
<v Speaker 2>it's</v>

1878
01:43:52.670 --> 01:43:56.960
<v Speaker 1>not so easy to sort out who's the good</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones and who's the bad was sort of like</v>

1879
01:43:56.961 --> 01:43:59.090
<v Speaker 1>what you were talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people that have this simplistic</v>

1880
01:43:59.091 --> 01:44:01.890
<v Speaker 1>idea that all you have to do is get</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump high on dmt and he's going</v>

1881
01:44:01.891 --> 01:44:04.460
<v Speaker 1>to see the light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not necessarily the case,</v>

1882
01:44:04.461 --> 01:44:07.820
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it would be wasted on him.</v>

1883
01:44:07.821 --> 01:44:12.821
<v Speaker 1>I think we would have to do at least at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least an indwelling catheter,</v>

1884
01:44:13.100 --> 01:44:18.100
<v Speaker 1>maybe three hours of continuous</v>
<v Speaker 1>infusion.</v>

1885
01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:23.240
<v Speaker 1>Wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong term,</v>

1886
01:44:24.160 --> 01:44:25.970
<v Speaker 1>intravenous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very,</v>

1887
01:44:27.070 --> 01:44:30.040
<v Speaker 1>very freudian decided to go through his</v>
<v Speaker 1>dick.</v>

1888
01:44:30.270 --> 01:44:31.660
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is hilarious.</v>

1889
01:44:32.470 --> 01:44:33.490
<v Speaker 1>Not that we'll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll,</v>

1890
01:44:33.910 --> 01:44:36.040
<v Speaker 1>we'll go through the vein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1891
01:44:36.270 --> 01:44:37.660
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he might have nailed it the</v>

1892
01:44:37.661 --> 01:44:41.110
<v Speaker 1>first time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might be the way to get it,</v>

1893
01:44:41.430 --> 01:44:45.310
<v Speaker 1>but maybe the way to get it to them as</v>
<v Speaker 1>some perfect Russian robot fucked off.</v>

1894
01:44:45.870 --> 01:44:48.310
<v Speaker 1>Just locks them up and you know.</v>

1895
01:44:48.370 --> 01:44:50.760
<v Speaker 1>Right when he gets inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

1896
01:44:50.860 --> 01:44:55.080
<v Speaker 1>She gets them in full guard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Locks them in place and catheter.</v>

1897
01:44:55.081 --> 01:44:57.500
<v Speaker 1>Like delivery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1898
01:44:58.580 --> 01:45:00.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they can program at like,</v>

1899
01:45:00.290 --> 01:45:03.380
<v Speaker 1>like Dmt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like little nanobots that go right</v>

1900
01:45:03.381 --> 01:45:05.600
<v Speaker 1>through the hole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right through the penis hole,</v>

1901
01:45:06.730 --> 01:45:09.640
<v Speaker 1>right into the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just run out of her right in there</v>

1902
01:45:09.641 --> 01:45:12.600
<v Speaker 1>and he's whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just takes off.</v>

1903
01:45:12.780 --> 01:45:15.090
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there has to be something.</v>

1904
01:45:15.340 --> 01:45:17.670
<v Speaker 1>Somebody animated that have an effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please.</v>

1905
01:45:17.671 --> 01:45:20.430
<v Speaker 1>So many anime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know there's somebody out there that</v>

1906
01:45:20.431 --> 01:45:25.260
<v Speaker 1>wants to do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way to do it.</v>

1907
01:45:25.500 --> 01:45:27.600
<v Speaker 1>Just some perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>super hot.</v>

1908
01:45:27.630 --> 01:45:32.630
<v Speaker 1>10 Russian hooker looking chick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No offense to Russian hookers,</v>

1909
01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:36.720
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or Donald Trump or Donald Trump even.</v>

1910
01:45:36.810 --> 01:45:39.120
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump was a baby at one point in</v>

1911
01:45:39.121 --> 01:45:39.721
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1912
01:45:39.721 --> 01:45:41.490
<v Speaker 1>and you and I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we both have children.</v>

1913
01:45:41.491 --> 01:45:43.860
<v Speaker 1>We know this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a delicate process of turning an</v>

1914
01:45:43.861 --> 01:45:45.040
<v Speaker 1>adult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1915
01:45:45.330 --> 01:45:46.970
<v Speaker 1>making it an adult out of a child.</v>

1916
01:45:47.020 --> 01:45:51.930
<v Speaker 1>A lot of factors come into play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but almost all babies are born well.</v>

1917
01:45:51.931 --> 01:45:55.200
<v Speaker 1>They'd certainly have their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality in many ways,</v>

1918
01:45:55.201 --> 01:45:58.050
<v Speaker 1>a blank slate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they're in a lot of ways,</v>

1919
01:45:58.051 --> 01:46:00.120
<v Speaker 1>a victim of the environment that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>raised in.</v>

1920
01:46:00.800 --> 01:46:05.800
<v Speaker 1>And that's one of the weird things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've developed in my own self over the</v>

1921
01:46:06.510 --> 01:46:08.850
<v Speaker 1>last few years is just thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 1>people as babies.</v>

1922
01:46:09.270 --> 01:46:13.080
<v Speaker 1>I think if everyone has a baby now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since I've had kids,</v>

1923
01:46:13.470 --> 01:46:15.330
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously I think of them as</v>

1924
01:46:15.331 --> 01:46:17.940
<v Speaker 1>being adults,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think of them as an adult that</v>

1925
01:46:17.941 --> 01:46:21.090
<v Speaker 1>used to be a baby.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I never used to do that before I had</v>

1926
01:46:21.091 --> 01:46:22.590
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to think of people as being a</v>

1927
01:46:22.591 --> 01:46:24.000
<v Speaker 1>static state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1928
01:46:24.001 --> 01:46:24.661
<v Speaker 1>you and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1929
01:46:24.661 --> 01:46:27.180
<v Speaker 1>this is Dennis Mckenna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how Dennis Mckenna has always</v>

1930
01:46:27.181 --> 01:46:28.260
<v Speaker 1>been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now I go,</v>

1931
01:46:28.261 --> 01:46:29.820
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dennis used to be a little boy,</v>

1932
01:46:30.060 --> 01:46:31.440
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dennis was a baby.</v>

1933
01:46:31.470 --> 01:46:32.720
<v Speaker 1>He used to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1934
01:46:32.790 --> 01:46:35.540
<v Speaker 1>and then he saw a lot of songs and a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of things,</v>

1935
01:46:35.700 --> 01:46:36.760
<v Speaker 1>but you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1936
01:46:36.890 --> 01:46:40.800
<v Speaker 1>Like trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's almost as much of a victim as he is</v>

1937
01:46:40.801 --> 01:46:43.980
<v Speaker 1>a perpetrator in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is.</v>

1938
01:46:44.610 --> 01:46:48.870
<v Speaker 1>Trump's a good example of somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean in some ways he's still a child.</v>

1939
01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:49.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

1940
01:46:49.470 --> 01:46:50.130
<v Speaker 1>He never</v>

1941
01:46:50.130 --> 01:46:53.560
<v Speaker 2>really grew up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's part of the problem and</v>

1942
01:46:53.590 --> 01:46:56.340
<v Speaker 2>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he has so much power and money,</v>

1943
01:46:56.341 --> 01:46:59.970
<v Speaker 2>everyone kowtows to his impulses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1944
01:47:00.060 --> 01:47:05.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean somebody like jared and Ivanka or</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a stabilizing influence on him,</v>

1945
01:47:05.550 --> 01:47:08.670
<v Speaker 2>old or older,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though I'm sure their agenda is</v>

1946
01:47:08.671 --> 01:47:11.370
<v Speaker 2>totally evil as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Confused.</v>

1947
01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:14.040
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they definitely don't deserve the amount</v>

1948
01:47:14.041 --> 01:47:15.900
<v Speaker 2>of power that they're wielding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nor does anybody.</v>

1949
01:47:15.901 --> 01:47:20.370
<v Speaker 2>What's more fascinating about him than</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything is that what he holds up to the</v>

1950
01:47:20.371 --> 01:47:22.050
<v Speaker 2>golden standard is success,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1951
01:47:22.290 --> 01:47:23.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is the guy that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1952
01:47:23.850 --> 01:47:27.000
<v Speaker 2>everything has to have his name on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So trump this and trump that,</v>

1953
01:47:27.001 --> 01:47:31.350
<v Speaker 2>and if you looked at the great American</v>
<v Speaker 2>vision of success,</v>

1954
01:47:31.351 --> 01:47:34.260
<v Speaker 2>it's to become some sort of super rich</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultra billionaire,</v>

1955
01:47:34.380 --> 01:47:38.670
<v Speaker 2>but even though everybody knows he's the</v>
<v Speaker 2>super rich ultra billionaire,</v>

1956
01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:42.690
<v Speaker 2>he still is deceptive about his own</v>
<v Speaker 2>success.</v>

1957
01:47:42.810 --> 01:47:46.770
<v Speaker 2>He still has to lie about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He still has to distort it far past,</v>

1958
01:47:46.980 --> 01:47:49.350
<v Speaker 2>whether it's the numbers that came to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the inauguration,</v>

1959
01:47:49.351 --> 01:47:52.020
<v Speaker 2>whether it's the numbers that he won the</v>
<v Speaker 2>electoral college by.</v>

1960
01:47:52.260 --> 01:47:54.510
<v Speaker 2>He lies about all these different things</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's an.</v>

1961
01:47:54.520 --> 01:47:56.970
<v Speaker 2>It's inherent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a part of him.</v>

1962
01:47:56.971 --> 01:48:00.720
<v Speaker 2>This intense lack of satisfaction with</v>
<v Speaker 2>any result,</v>

1963
01:48:01.470 --> 01:48:04.530
<v Speaker 2>any result,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it's winning by a mile,</v>

1964
01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:06.740
<v Speaker 2>he must win by 100 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1965
01:48:07.110 --> 01:48:08.880
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's childish.</v>

1966
01:48:09.090 --> 01:48:12.480
<v Speaker 2>That's like an intense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's that same intense</v>

1967
01:48:12.481 --> 01:48:16.350
<v Speaker 2>dissatisfaction that's inherently very</v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous in a leader because it's</v>

1968
01:48:16.351 --> 01:48:20.940
<v Speaker 2>leading him to make these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these critical judgments that aren't</v>

1969
01:48:20.941 --> 01:48:25.680
<v Speaker 2>based entirely unreality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but rather what he wants people to</v>

1970
01:48:25.681 --> 01:48:26.990
<v Speaker 2>perceive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1971
01:48:27.210 --> 01:48:28.560
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's quite right.</v>

1972
01:48:28.590 --> 01:48:31.470
<v Speaker 2>I think that's dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what we were saying before,</v>

1973
01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:34.890
<v Speaker 2>no thoughtfulness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no thoughtfulness and the man,</v>

1974
01:48:34.891 --> 01:48:37.890
<v Speaker 2>there's no reflection,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reflection,</v>

1975
01:48:37.891 --> 01:48:38.730
<v Speaker 2>a lack of humility.</v>

1976
01:48:38.730 --> 01:48:42.760
<v Speaker 2>So this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not what you want in your</v>

1977
01:48:42.780 --> 01:48:45.680
<v Speaker 2>leaders because we see what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1978
01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:49.590
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going back and forth with the</v>

1979
01:48:49.591 --> 01:48:54.590
<v Speaker 2>Soviets is going back and forth with</v>
<v Speaker 2>North Korea and it's like a schoolyard</v>

1980
01:48:54.610 --> 01:48:55.443
<v Speaker 2>spot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1981
01:48:55.590 --> 01:48:58.020
<v Speaker 2>but these people have nuclear weapons to</v>
<v Speaker 2>throw.</v>

1982
01:48:58.021 --> 01:49:01.080
<v Speaker 2>So we need to back off from that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald,</v>

1983
01:49:01.081 --> 01:49:02.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just.</v>

1984
01:49:02.970 --> 01:49:06.030
<v Speaker 2>But he can't do that because he has to</v>
<v Speaker 2>respond.</v>

1985
01:49:06.031 --> 01:49:09.060
<v Speaker 2>He has this impulse to respond.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1986
01:49:09.061 --> 01:49:10.260
<v Speaker 2>I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1987
01:49:10.950 --> 01:49:12.000
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

1988
01:49:12.060 --> 01:49:15.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean if he's not going to be exposed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

1989
01:49:15.590 --> 01:49:20.590
<v Speaker 2>I was pretty sure unfortunately because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would help him and you know,</v>

1990
01:49:21.781 --> 01:49:23.670
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is disturbing to me.</v>

1991
01:49:23.671 --> 01:49:28.671
<v Speaker 2>Many things about donald and this sort</v>
<v Speaker 2>of reality distortion and has created</v>

1992
01:49:28.861 --> 01:49:31.150
<v Speaker 2>his people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1993
01:49:31.170 --> 01:49:34.290
<v Speaker 2>they take it seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean they're sort of like intimidated</v>

1994
01:49:34.291 --> 01:49:36.480
<v Speaker 2>by it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not enough people are standing up and</v>

1995
01:49:36.481 --> 01:49:38.910
<v Speaker 2>saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this is not true.</v>

1996
01:49:38.911 --> 01:49:41.970
<v Speaker 2>This is not true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're completely diluted about this</v>

1997
01:49:41.971 --> 01:49:43.170
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1998
01:49:43.650 --> 01:49:48.040
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a some sort of impulse to</v>
<v Speaker 2>show some respect</v>

1999
01:49:48.820 --> 01:49:52.270
<v Speaker 1>when no respect is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is do you know,</v>

2000
01:49:52.860 --> 01:49:55.500
<v Speaker 1>respect for the office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the office,</v>

2001
01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:57.160
<v Speaker 1>for whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

2002
01:49:57.760 --> 01:50:01.540
<v Speaker 1>but then when he comes out with these</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that are obviously not true,</v>

2003
01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:04.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are no alternative facts.</v>

2004
01:50:05.410 --> 01:50:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Alternative facts are lies as our candy</v>
<v Speaker 1>coating of Bullshit alternative facts is</v>

2005
01:50:13.241 --> 01:50:15.190
<v Speaker 1>the muscle areas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>candy coating of bullshit ever.</v>

2006
01:50:16.300 --> 01:50:18.850
<v Speaker 1>My,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my hope is that we get through this</v>

2007
01:50:18.851 --> 01:50:22.090
<v Speaker 1>without nuclear war and then we realized</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we can't have a fucking president</v>

2008
01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:26.290
<v Speaker 1>and the idea of having one alpha champ</v>
<v Speaker 1>run the entire group of 300 plus million</v>

2009
01:50:26.291 --> 01:50:30.670
<v Speaker 1>people is insane and it doesn't work</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have technology,</v>

2010
01:50:30.671 --> 01:50:33.520
<v Speaker 1>when you have this ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate instantaneously,</v>

2011
01:50:34.060 --> 01:50:37.630
<v Speaker 1>globally with everybody constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

2012
01:50:37.660 --> 01:50:42.550
<v Speaker 1>it's an archaic idea that served its</v>
<v Speaker 1>time but needs to be revamped.</v>

2013
01:50:43.270 --> 01:50:45.430
<v Speaker 1>How would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good question.</v>

2014
01:50:45.460 --> 01:50:48.790
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not the guy to be the architect of</v>

2015
01:50:48.791 --> 01:50:52.030
<v Speaker 1>the future civilization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would think that putting as much</v>

2016
01:50:52.031 --> 01:50:56.590
<v Speaker 1>power as we put into one individual is</v>
<v Speaker 1>insanely problematic.</v>

2017
01:50:56.740 --> 01:50:59.260
<v Speaker 1>It's just you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with all these ego</v>

2018
01:50:59.261 --> 01:51:01.510
<v Speaker 1>issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decision making issues,</v>

2019
01:51:01.870 --> 01:51:04.390
<v Speaker 1>and also the camps that two separate</v>
<v Speaker 1>camps,</v>

2020
01:51:04.391 --> 01:51:06.430
<v Speaker 1>the right left camp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy too.</v>

2021
01:51:06.610 --> 01:51:08.140
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2022
01:51:08.260 --> 01:51:09.093
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2023
01:51:09.310 --> 01:51:14.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean I think one way to approach it</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have to be such a such a</v>

2024
01:51:15.100 --> 01:51:20.100
<v Speaker 1>tremendous shift from what we've got</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be to go to a parliamentary system</v>

2025
01:51:21.760 --> 01:51:23.740
<v Speaker 1>like Canada has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

2026
01:51:23.950 --> 01:51:28.950
<v Speaker 1>where you represent your party and if</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other party gets enough,</v>

2027
01:51:30.310 --> 01:51:34.210
<v Speaker 1>they can vote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vote you out without going through the</v>

2028
01:51:34.211 --> 01:51:37.750
<v Speaker 1>whole impeachment process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no impeachment process.</v>

2029
01:51:37.751 --> 01:51:42.250
<v Speaker 1>The parties can form a coalition and</v>
<v Speaker 1>vote the prime minister out,</v>

2030
01:51:42.490 --> 01:51:45.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's much easier to topple a</v>

2031
01:51:45.011 --> 01:51:47.200
<v Speaker 1>government and in some ways that's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good thing.</v>

2032
01:51:47.350 --> 01:51:51.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more resilient and Canada's a good,</v>

2033
01:51:51.700 --> 01:51:53.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are many parliamentary</v>

2034
01:51:53.141 --> 01:51:56.380
<v Speaker 1>democracies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the one that's closest.</v>

2035
01:51:56.830 --> 01:52:01.830
<v Speaker 1>I think there's also an issue with</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with the real problems of the</v>

2036
01:52:02.111 --> 01:52:07.111
<v Speaker 1>world in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time where they're the realities of</v>

2037
01:52:07.631 --> 01:52:10.330
<v Speaker 1>say Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on over there are so</v>

2038
01:52:10.331 --> 01:52:15.280
<v Speaker 1>horrific and they're so far removed from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the realities that we deal with here.</v>

2039
01:52:15.730 --> 01:52:18.790
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you almost need to have someone who has</v>

2040
01:52:18.850 --> 01:52:22.450
<v Speaker 1>some sort of experience with those</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in those lands to understand and</v>

2041
01:52:22.451 --> 01:52:27.451
<v Speaker 1>put it into perspective and I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're entirely lacking of that</v>

2042
01:52:27.701 --> 01:52:31.270
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in terms of our culture,</v>

2043
01:52:31.570 --> 01:52:36.570
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we understand what a</v>
<v Speaker 1>brutal military military dictatorship is</v>

2044
01:52:36.731 --> 01:52:39.760
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we see it on television and it</v>

2045
01:52:39.761 --> 01:52:44.500
<v Speaker 1>seems almost too abstract,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the president has to deal with that</v>

2046
01:52:44.560 --> 01:52:46.190
<v Speaker 1>in a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a very real way</v>

2047
01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:50.300
<v Speaker 2>and no one person can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's what advisors are for.</v>

2048
01:52:50.450 --> 01:52:53.030
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you don't have good advisors or</v>

2049
01:52:53.031 --> 01:52:56.720
<v Speaker 2>if you choose to ignore them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you're in deep shit.</v>

2050
01:52:56.840 --> 01:52:58.160
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2051
01:52:58.450 --> 01:53:03.450
<v Speaker 2>I mean donald appoints advisors who</v>
<v Speaker 2>already share his delusions of course.</v>

2052
01:53:03.680 --> 01:53:05.840
<v Speaker 2>So there's nobody there to say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>

2053
01:53:06.290 --> 01:53:07.730
<v Speaker 2>you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2054
01:53:07.731 --> 01:53:10.370
<v Speaker 2>and based on experience and expertise</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all this,</v>

2055
01:53:10.371 --> 01:53:15.371
<v Speaker 2>you're wrong and you need to rethink it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what bothers me about one among</v>

2056
01:53:17.451 --> 01:53:20.630
<v Speaker 2>many things about the way that he</v>
<v Speaker 2>proceeds.</v>

2057
01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:24.530
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the thing that bothers me most about the</v>

2058
01:53:24.531 --> 01:53:29.531
<v Speaker 2>change in administrations is that they</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically looked at climate change.</v>

2059
01:53:30.340 --> 01:53:31.850
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't believe it.</v>

2060
01:53:31.851 --> 01:53:34.070
<v Speaker 2>It's not happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not.</v>

2061
01:53:34.071 --> 01:53:38.450
<v Speaker 2>It's not even on the table,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and actually that needs to be the thing</v>

2062
01:53:38.570 --> 01:53:41.420
<v Speaker 2>on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That should be the primary thing we're</v>

2063
01:53:41.421 --> 01:53:46.421
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All this other stuff is important,</v>

2064
01:53:46.580 --> 01:53:51.260
<v Speaker 2>but we're talking about the accelerating</v>
<v Speaker 2>changes that are,</v>

2065
01:53:51.320 --> 01:53:56.320
<v Speaker 2>that are essentially under,</v>
<v Speaker 2>under mining the mechanisms that keep</v>

2066
01:53:58.010 --> 01:54:00.440
<v Speaker 2>the earth habitable by life.</v>

2067
01:54:00.440 --> 01:54:04.070
<v Speaker 2>This is a pretty important issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to have people that say,</v>

2068
01:54:04.071 --> 01:54:05.170
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it isn't.</v>

2069
01:54:05.430 --> 01:54:08.960
<v Speaker 2>We don't believe in climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well I'm sorry,</v>

2070
01:54:08.961 --> 01:54:12.170
<v Speaker 2>climate change is real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't care what the fuck you believe</v>

2071
01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:17.440
<v Speaker 2>it is real and free for this</v>
<v Speaker 2>administration to not only ignore it,</v>

2072
01:54:17.721 --> 01:54:22.721
<v Speaker 2>but then roll back all these other</v>
<v Speaker 2>measures that were put into place is a,</v>

2073
01:54:24.140 --> 01:54:26.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just the stupidest idea.</v>

2074
01:54:26.331 --> 01:54:30.050
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't imagine not just roll back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but removing the funding for monitoring</v>

2075
01:54:30.500 --> 01:54:34.100
<v Speaker 2>removing is really scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Suppressing the inflammation and all</v>

2076
01:54:34.101 --> 01:54:35.480
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2077
01:54:35.600 --> 01:54:37.910
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you look at the people in the,</v>

2078
01:54:38.060 --> 01:54:41.360
<v Speaker 2>in the trump administration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're either from the energy industry,</v>

2079
01:54:41.690 --> 01:54:43.530
<v Speaker 2>Rex Tillerson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2080
01:54:44.300 --> 01:54:48.550
<v Speaker 2>I think the government has become</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially a subsidiary of Exxonmobil</v>

2081
01:54:49.650 --> 01:54:52.340
<v Speaker 2>and not the other way around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

2082
01:54:52.370 --> 01:54:53.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's uh,</v>

2083
01:54:53.961 --> 01:54:56.000
<v Speaker 2>that's what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's terrifying.</v>

2084
01:54:56.001 --> 01:54:58.790
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Goldman Sachs or Exxon Mobil.</v>

2085
01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:01.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>corporations around the world.</v>

2086
01:55:01.401 --> 01:55:04.010
<v Speaker 2>We've known this for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Governments are just,</v>

2087
01:55:04.011 --> 01:55:07.930
<v Speaker 2>puppets does this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In some ways it's just too eerily</v>

2088
01:55:07.940 --> 01:55:10.410
<v Speaker 2>parallel to what we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the rainforest,</v>

2089
01:55:10.610 --> 01:55:15.470
<v Speaker 2>like with all these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all this potential in the rainforest and</v>

2090
01:55:15.471 --> 01:55:18.530
<v Speaker 2>almost this race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the race to see like,</v>

2091
01:55:18.770 --> 01:55:22.190
<v Speaker 2>can we get to these incredible new</v>
<v Speaker 2>plants that we haven't discovered</v>

2092
01:55:22.340 --> 01:55:24.830
<v Speaker 2>before?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We fuck it up by cutting down all the</v>

2093
01:55:24.831 --> 01:55:29.831
<v Speaker 2>hardwoods and burning all the forest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we get to this potential future</v>

2094
01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:35.420
<v Speaker 2>utopia of people being able to read each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other's minds.</v>

2095
01:55:35.421 --> 01:55:37.900
<v Speaker 2>Being able to communicate simultaneously</v>
<v Speaker 2>all throughout the winter,</v>

2096
01:55:38.060 --> 01:55:40.610
<v Speaker 2>understanding each other regardless of</v>
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>

2097
01:55:40.611 --> 01:55:44.070
<v Speaker 2>Can we get to that before we blow up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before we</v>

2098
01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:47.850
<v Speaker 1>get into a nuclear war with North Korea?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it is crazy shit,</v>

2099
01:55:47.950 --> 01:55:50.400
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This insane administration that's</v>

2100
01:55:50.401 --> 01:55:55.401
<v Speaker 1>existing in this sort of chaotic manner</v>
<v Speaker 1>alongside some of the brightest minds</v>

2101
01:55:56.251 --> 01:55:58.620
<v Speaker 1>and most innovative people that have</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever walked the face of the planet that</v>

2102
01:55:58.621 --> 01:56:03.621
<v Speaker 1>are influencing things in a way today</v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's really unparalleled in terms</v>

2103
01:56:03.631 --> 01:56:06.690
<v Speaker 1>of human history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the potential that any new invention or</v>

2104
01:56:06.691 --> 01:56:11.691
<v Speaker 1>innovation can enact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's understanding new compounds</v>

2105
01:56:11.851 --> 01:56:14.790
<v Speaker 1>that we discovered in the rain forest or</v>
<v Speaker 1>some new technology that's made in</v>

2106
01:56:14.791 --> 01:56:16.200
<v Speaker 1>Silicon Valley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2107
01:56:16.350 --> 01:56:18.540
<v Speaker 1>it's an amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing parallel.</v>

2108
01:56:19.140 --> 01:56:19.861
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2109
01:56:19.861 --> 01:56:22.230
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does seem like it does seem like a</v>

2110
01:56:22.231 --> 01:56:26.550
<v Speaker 1>race in some ways between idiocy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>genius.</v>

2111
01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:31.460
<v Speaker 1>They're incredibly brilliant people and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're developing.</v>

2112
01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:34.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are solutions to the problems that</v>

2113
01:56:34.111 --> 01:56:35.190
<v Speaker 1>face us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2114
01:56:35.610 --> 01:56:38.550
<v Speaker 1>But they have on the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the know nothings,</v>

2115
01:56:38.551 --> 01:56:40.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are marching into the future,</v>

2116
01:56:41.010 --> 01:56:43.410
<v Speaker 1>eyes firmly fixed on the rear view</v>
<v Speaker 1>mirror.</v>

2117
01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:44.640
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

2118
01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:47.280
<v Speaker 1>coal technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the greatest thing.</v>

2119
01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:49.410
<v Speaker 1>Let's go back to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2120
01:56:49.740 --> 01:56:51.700
<v Speaker 1>is that stupid or what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2121
01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:56.430
<v Speaker 1>cold technology is obsolete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's stupid and you know,</v>

2122
01:56:56.431 --> 01:56:58.410
<v Speaker 1>there are better solutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2123
01:56:58.411 --> 01:57:00.460
<v Speaker 1>or the whole attitude towards drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2124
01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:02.790
<v Speaker 1>the war on drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The war on drugs was great.</v>

2125
01:57:03.090 --> 01:57:06.390
<v Speaker 1>Let's go back to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean these are people who are not</v>

2126
01:57:06.750 --> 01:57:11.750
<v Speaker 1>living in the present for one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not planning for the future and they</v>

2127
01:57:11.761 --> 01:57:14.340
<v Speaker 1>don't really want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like our minds are made up.</v>

2128
01:57:14.400 --> 01:57:17.970
<v Speaker 1>We know drug abuse has got to be bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's prohibit it.</v>

2129
01:57:17.971 --> 01:57:22.500
<v Speaker 1>Let's go back to the old model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not capable of entertaining a</v>

2130
01:57:22.590 --> 01:57:25.100
<v Speaker 1>new ideas and that's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2131
01:57:25.290 --> 01:57:28.470
<v Speaker 1>what do you think about the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I've heard this brought up and I've,</v>

2132
01:57:28.500 --> 01:57:33.500
<v Speaker 1>I've entertained at my own self that</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we need some sort of enemy or some</v>

2133
01:57:34.681 --> 01:57:39.681
<v Speaker 1>sort of thing to resist in order to rise</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the full potential of innovation,</v>

2134
01:57:39.841 --> 01:57:43.920
<v Speaker 1>of ideas of that we almost need some</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of mountain to conquer.</v>

2135
01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:47.010
<v Speaker 1>We need some sort of a force to be aware</v>
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>

2136
01:57:47.220 --> 01:57:49.590
<v Speaker 1>It really makes people rise up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've seen more,</v>

2137
01:57:50.100 --> 01:57:55.100
<v Speaker 1>more people politically active and</v>
<v Speaker 1>politically engaged now post election</v>

2138
01:57:55.290 --> 01:57:58.710
<v Speaker 1>than I ever did before the election</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I didn't expect trump to win.</v>

2139
01:57:58.780 --> 01:58:00.300
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now that he did,</v>

2140
01:58:00.301 --> 01:58:05.160
<v Speaker 1>it's like it's raised up this resistance</v>
<v Speaker 1>to this insane level that I've never</v>

2141
01:58:05.161 --> 01:58:06.930
<v Speaker 1>experienced before in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2142
01:58:06.931 --> 01:58:09.720
<v Speaker 1>it feels to me like Kent State all over</v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

2143
01:58:09.721 --> 01:58:13.260
<v Speaker 1>It feels to know where it was a real</v>
<v Speaker 1>shock that he won.</v>

2144
01:58:13.261 --> 01:58:14.190
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2145
01:58:14.340 --> 01:58:16.260
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been a wake up call.</v>

2146
01:58:16.770 --> 01:58:20.760
<v Speaker 1>So now there is this strong resistance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2147
01:58:20.790 --> 01:58:22.290
<v Speaker 1>movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2148
01:58:22.380 --> 01:58:26.430
<v Speaker 1>and there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a good thing that that's</v>

2149
01:58:26.431 --> 01:58:30.540
<v Speaker 1>happened at also journalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How suddenly found itself again,</v>

2150
01:58:31.050 --> 01:58:32.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some journalists,</v>

2151
01:58:33.130 --> 01:58:36.090
<v Speaker 1>some sectors of it are beginning to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2152
01:58:36.150 --> 01:58:38.940
<v Speaker 1>for so long they were essentially</v>
<v Speaker 1>stenographers.</v>

2153
01:58:38.950 --> 01:58:41.300
<v Speaker 1>They would repeat whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mouthpieces,</v>

2154
01:58:41.440 --> 01:58:42.273
<v Speaker 1>the government.</v>

2155
01:58:42.310 --> 01:58:47.310
<v Speaker 2>Now the journalists are questioning</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything and asking tough questions of</v>

2156
01:58:48.131 --> 01:58:51.340
<v Speaker 2>these clowns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm expecting answers and it's kind of</v>

2157
01:58:51.341 --> 01:58:51.820
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2158
01:58:51.820 --> 01:58:54.490
<v Speaker 2>when I was young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted it to be a journalist,</v>

2159
01:58:54.491 --> 01:58:57.760
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I thought Walter cronkite was the cat's</v>

2160
01:58:57.850 --> 01:59:00.340
<v Speaker 2>pajamas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to be like him,</v>

2161
01:59:00.341 --> 01:59:03.070
<v Speaker 2>I wanted or I wanted it to be a foreign</v>
<v Speaker 2>correspondent.</v>

2162
01:59:04.060 --> 01:59:09.060
<v Speaker 2>I just admire journalism and for a long</v>
<v Speaker 2>time I have not found anything to admire</v>

2163
01:59:09.251 --> 01:59:10.360
<v Speaker 2>in it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're,</v>

2164
01:59:10.690 --> 01:59:13.000
<v Speaker 2>they've all been lobotomized or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something,</v>

2165
01:59:13.740 --> 01:59:15.670
<v Speaker 2>but they're rediscovering it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2166
01:59:15.671 --> 01:59:20.200
<v Speaker 2>the good ones are rediscovering it and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reemergence of investigative</v>

2167
01:59:20.230 --> 01:59:23.320
<v Speaker 2>journalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And right now I think that's the,</v>

2168
01:59:23.620 --> 01:59:25.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's our best hope because I think</v>

2169
01:59:25.961 --> 01:59:26.794
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2170
01:59:27.700 --> 01:59:30.190
<v Speaker 2>these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll just keep digging.</v>

2171
01:59:30.250 --> 01:59:34.120
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be so much bad stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>come up about trump and the oldest</v>

2172
01:59:34.121 --> 01:59:37.030
<v Speaker 2>collusion with the Russians and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2173
01:59:37.031 --> 01:59:40.720
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially enough to impeach him.</v>

2174
01:59:40.720 --> 01:59:45.010
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will the Republicans find enough spine</v>

2175
01:59:45.011 --> 01:59:46.200
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2176
01:59:46.340 --> 01:59:47.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do that.</v>

2177
01:59:48.520 --> 01:59:50.320
<v Speaker 2>But they did with Nixon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2178
01:59:50.500 --> 01:59:52.120
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think some,</v>

2179
01:59:52.180 --> 01:59:55.300
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what he did was not nearly as bad as</v>

2180
01:59:55.301 --> 01:59:59.020
<v Speaker 2>what trump is doing and so we'll see</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it goes,</v>

2181
01:59:59.021 --> 02:00:02.080
<v Speaker 2>but shameless in a way that Nixon never</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch shameless.</v>

2182
02:00:02.370 --> 02:00:02.860
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

2183
02:00:02.860 --> 02:00:03.551
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2184
02:00:03.551 --> 02:00:08.551
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I take a certain comfort in the thought</v>

2185
02:00:09.611 --> 02:00:10.610
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2186
02:00:10.660 --> 02:00:13.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have all these draconian things.</v>

2187
02:00:13.090 --> 02:00:16.240
<v Speaker 2>They want to do a rollback,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the environmental regulations,</v>

2188
02:00:16.720 --> 02:00:18.770
<v Speaker 2>whole immigration thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2189
02:00:18.880 --> 02:00:20.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a war on drugs,</v>

2190
02:00:20.950 --> 02:00:25.270
<v Speaker 2>but none of it is going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of it actually will happen with the</v>

2191
02:00:25.271 --> 02:00:27.820
<v Speaker 2>immigration stuff is pretty real here in</v>
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>

2192
02:00:27.821 --> 02:00:28.350
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2193
02:00:28.350 --> 02:00:32.310
<v Speaker 2>I see he is showing up at home depots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They showed up at home people's.</v>

2194
02:00:32.320 --> 02:00:37.320
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who was born in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's Mexican and they asked him where he</v>

2195
02:00:37.521 --> 02:00:38.420
<v Speaker 1>was born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They pulled me,</v>

2196
02:00:38.421 --> 02:00:42.140
<v Speaker 1>he's a veteran and he knew like how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with this and he knew what's legal</v>

2197
02:00:42.141 --> 02:00:43.120
<v Speaker 1>and what's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

2198
02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:46.250
<v Speaker 1>it's a grown man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's in his fifties and the citizen</v>

2199
02:00:46.470 --> 02:00:51.470
<v Speaker 1>citizen and a veteran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he served the country in Iraq.</v>

2200
02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:54.230
<v Speaker 1>And so they're coming up to him and ask</v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

2201
02:00:54.590 --> 02:00:56.120
<v Speaker 1>where are you born?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he's like,</v>

2202
02:00:56.121 --> 02:00:58.060
<v Speaker 1>you can't ask me that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know was like,</v>

2203
02:00:58.070 --> 02:00:59.480
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not allowed to ask me where I'm</v>

2204
02:00:59.481 --> 02:01:00.314
<v Speaker 1>born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

2205
02:01:00.620 --> 02:01:01.341
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>

2206
02:01:01.341 --> 02:01:03.920
<v Speaker 1>who are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what were immigration and whatever</v>

2207
02:01:03.921 --> 02:01:05.690
<v Speaker 1>the ice stands for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he goes,</v>

2208
02:01:05.691 --> 02:01:07.950
<v Speaker 1>let me see some documentation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the guy shows him his badge and his</v>

2209
02:01:07.951 --> 02:01:08.301
<v Speaker 1>gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2210
02:01:08.301 --> 02:01:11.090
<v Speaker 1>that's not your fucking documentation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pull out your goddamn documentation.</v>

2211
02:01:11.300 --> 02:01:12.950
<v Speaker 1>And he pulls out his military id.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2212
02:01:12.951 --> 02:01:14.510
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's my documentation.</v>

2213
02:01:14.690 --> 02:01:16.100
<v Speaker 1>This is me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck are you?</v>

2214
02:01:16.650 --> 02:01:18.050
<v Speaker 1>Why are you asking people where they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>born?</v>

2215
02:01:18.051 --> 02:01:19.580
<v Speaker 1>I was born in California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2216
02:01:19.581 --> 02:01:22.220
<v Speaker 1>You're not allowed to just go up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and ask them where they're born,</v>

2217
02:01:22.430 --> 02:01:25.940
<v Speaker 1>but people that don't know that they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're getting arrested,</v>

2218
02:01:25.970 --> 02:01:27.770
<v Speaker 1>they're getting taken and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting deported.</v>

2219
02:01:27.771 --> 02:01:31.130
<v Speaker 1>They're taking people that are dropping</v>
<v Speaker 1>off their children at school,</v>

2220
02:01:31.610 --> 02:01:35.690
<v Speaker 1>the grabbing people and there's a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 1>of cases of this and you're just hearing</v>

2221
02:01:35.691 --> 02:01:40.580
<v Speaker 1>about the cases that get to the press.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So many them that you're never going to</v>

2222
02:01:40.581 --> 02:01:43.310
<v Speaker 1>hear about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is just rampant and this never</v>

2223
02:01:43.311 --> 02:01:45.800
<v Speaker 1>existed before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not In the Bush administration.</v>

2224
02:01:46.110 --> 02:01:47.930
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean not in Bush.</v>

2225
02:01:47.931 --> 02:01:50.870
<v Speaker 1>Senior immediate just didn't happen</v>
<v Speaker 1>before in any conservative</v>

2226
02:01:50.871 --> 02:01:52.970
<v Speaker 1>administration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't treat it like this.</v>

2227
02:01:52.971 --> 02:01:54.050
<v Speaker 1>This is a weird time.</v>

2228
02:01:54.450 --> 02:01:55.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is a very weird time,</v>

2229
02:01:55.980 --> 02:01:57.540
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's temporary.</v>

2230
02:01:57.800 --> 02:01:58.571
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope so,</v>

2231
02:01:58.571 --> 02:02:01.510
<v Speaker 1>but what you said about journalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's important to point out that</v>

2232
02:02:01.550 --> 02:02:03.820
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just as they fucked up,</v>

2233
02:02:03.821 --> 02:02:05.860
<v Speaker 1>just as hard with the left as they did</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the right.</v>

2234
02:02:06.220 --> 02:02:08.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they let the Clintons get away with a</v>

2235
02:02:08.501 --> 02:02:11.020
<v Speaker 1>lot of horseshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They gotta let Obama get away with a lot</v>

2236
02:02:11.021 --> 02:02:12.020
<v Speaker 1>of horseshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>

2237
02:02:12.330 --> 02:02:14.350
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they said talking points.</v>

2238
02:02:14.351 --> 02:02:17.560
<v Speaker 1>They were given talking points and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>ran with those talking points so that</v>

2239
02:02:17.561 --> 02:02:20.580
<v Speaker 1>they would get access to the president</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they will get access to congressmen,</v>

2240
02:02:20.581 --> 02:02:22.870
<v Speaker 1>the senators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they did it forever and it wasn't</v>

2241
02:02:22.871 --> 02:02:26.980
<v Speaker 1>journalism and you're right and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason why this guy got into place</v>

2242
02:02:26.981 --> 02:02:28.750
<v Speaker 1>in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this situation right now.</v>

2243
02:02:28.960 --> 02:02:33.960
<v Speaker 1>It's just as much of a fault of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>have not holding the left to the fire as</v>

2244
02:02:35.201 --> 02:02:36.130
<v Speaker 1>it is to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2245
02:02:36.160 --> 02:02:37.180
<v Speaker 1>what's going on right now.</v>

2246
02:02:37.830 --> 02:02:38.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2247
02:02:38.701 --> 02:02:42.000
<v Speaker 2>journalism has a lot to answer for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt about it.</v>

2248
02:02:42.090 --> 02:02:45.540
<v Speaker 2>I just have a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2249
02:02:45.541 --> 02:02:47.160
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's a delusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would just,</v>

2250
02:02:47.220 --> 02:02:48.110
<v Speaker 2>I would just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2251
02:02:48.160 --> 02:02:50.490
<v Speaker 2>I liked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would like to think that journalism is</v>

2252
02:02:50.491 --> 02:02:52.950
<v Speaker 2>finding its voice and finding its</v>
<v Speaker 2>function.</v>

2253
02:02:52.980 --> 02:02:54.780
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's function is to,</v>

2254
02:02:55.290 --> 02:02:56.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as somebody said,</v>

2255
02:02:56.431 --> 02:02:58.020
<v Speaker 2>I think it was I have stone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2256
02:02:58.021 --> 02:03:02.310
<v Speaker 2>the function is to comfort the afflicted</v>
<v Speaker 2>and afflict the comfortable.</v>

2257
02:03:02.311 --> 02:03:05.550
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's essentially the journalistic</v>

2258
02:03:05.551 --> 02:03:09.510
<v Speaker 2>mandates or express the truth and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>truth,</v>

2259
02:03:09.511 --> 02:03:12.420
<v Speaker 2>see the truth and form.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't assume,</v>

2260
02:03:12.990 --> 02:03:15.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>play the propaganda game,</v>

2261
02:03:15.390 --> 02:03:19.520
<v Speaker 2>be able to look beyond it and they have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be in this environment and the,</v>

2262
02:03:19.521 --> 02:03:22.410
<v Speaker 2>where people keep calling fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have to be undeniable.</v>

2263
02:03:22.830 --> 02:03:25.590
<v Speaker 2>And I think in that sense they are</v>
<v Speaker 2>reinvigorated,</v>

2264
02:03:25.670 --> 02:03:27.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's one of the things that,</v>

2265
02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:28.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2266
02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:32.520
<v Speaker 2>you're seeing that's one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the times talked about like after</v>

2267
02:03:32.521 --> 02:03:34.140
<v Speaker 2>it was over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after the election was over,</v>

2268
02:03:34.141 --> 02:03:35.310
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are,</v>

2269
02:03:35.380 --> 02:03:39.660
<v Speaker 2>we're going to reinvigorate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>refocused our dedication on journalism.</v>

2270
02:03:40.590 --> 02:03:45.090
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's a good sign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the other side of it is that we can</v>

2271
02:03:45.091 --> 02:03:46.600
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2272
02:03:46.620 --> 02:03:51.420
<v Speaker 2>the way the trump administration</v>
<v Speaker 2>proceeds with all these things,</v>

2273
02:03:51.421 --> 02:03:54.830
<v Speaker 2>they wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the inevitably just get bogged down in</v>

2274
02:03:54.840 --> 02:03:57.830
<v Speaker 2>litigation protest to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2275
02:03:58.110 --> 02:04:00.540
<v Speaker 2>at some point they do have to answer to</v>
<v Speaker 2>Congress.</v>

2276
02:04:01.530 --> 02:04:02.740
<v Speaker 2>So I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2277
02:04:02.930 --> 02:04:06.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean the wheels were already coming</v>
<v Speaker 2>off before he even took the oath of</v>

2278
02:04:06.361 --> 02:04:09.240
<v Speaker 2>office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've continued to come off and it's</v>

2279
02:04:09.241 --> 02:04:14.241
<v Speaker 2>just gonna get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a sort of a degenerate into</v>

2280
02:04:15.450 --> 02:04:19.620
<v Speaker 2>litigation acrimony and the ability to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get anything passed.</v>

2281
02:04:19.621 --> 02:04:21.180
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2282
02:04:21.750 --> 02:04:24.690
<v Speaker 2>which is all good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean essentially in this case,</v>

2283
02:04:24.691 --> 02:04:29.460
<v Speaker 2>chaos is our friend because they won't</v>
<v Speaker 2>be able to advance this draconian</v>

2284
02:04:29.461 --> 02:04:30.780
<v Speaker 2>agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank God.</v>

2285
02:04:30.781 --> 02:04:34.950
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hopefully circumstances will enable us</v>

2286
02:04:34.951 --> 02:04:37.550
<v Speaker 2>to get rid of them quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2287
02:04:37.620 --> 02:04:38.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2288
02:04:38.491 --> 02:04:40.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not entirely confident in that.</v>

2289
02:04:41.020 --> 02:04:43.290
<v Speaker 1>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing to me when I'm looking</v>

2290
02:04:43.291 --> 02:04:45.840
<v Speaker 1>at these protests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what was going on yesterday where</v>

2291
02:04:46.020 --> 02:04:49.140
<v Speaker 1>people are just beating the shit out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other in the streets is people with</v>

2292
02:04:49.141 --> 02:04:52.260
<v Speaker 1>red hats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the red hats are the bad people.</v>

2293
02:04:52.261 --> 02:04:54.420
<v Speaker 1>It's so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so strange.</v>

2294
02:04:54.421 --> 02:04:55.980
<v Speaker 1>Scene people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these make America great again.</v>

2295
02:04:55.981 --> 02:05:00.180
<v Speaker 1>Hats fighting with people that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing masks and motorcycle helmets and</v>

2296
02:05:00.181 --> 02:05:03.540
<v Speaker 1>their sticks and people were throwing</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoke bombs.</v>

2297
02:05:03.541 --> 02:05:04.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is crazy.</v>

2298
02:05:04.981 --> 02:05:09.981
<v Speaker 1>I really never thought we'd see such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>clear right versus left civil war.</v>

2299
02:05:11.010 --> 02:05:13.080
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like these little battles,</v>

2300
02:05:13.270 --> 02:05:17.430
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be ramping up and becoming</v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more common and,</v>

2301
02:05:17.431 --> 02:05:19.350
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and becoming more and more violent.</v>

2302
02:05:19.740 --> 02:05:21.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems that it is,</v>

2303
02:05:21.570 --> 02:05:24.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so what can we do?</v>

2304
02:05:24.270 --> 02:05:27.420
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not out on the streets protesting</v>

2305
02:05:27.421 --> 02:05:28.990
<v Speaker 2>on one side or another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2306
02:05:28.991 --> 02:05:30.150
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2307
02:05:30.300 --> 02:05:30.930
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2308
02:05:30.930 --> 02:05:34.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then basically I think for me,</v>

2309
02:05:35.880 --> 02:05:38.370
<v Speaker 2>I continue to do it what I'm doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think,</v>

2310
02:05:38.490 --> 02:05:43.490
<v Speaker 2>I think these plant medicines are the</v>
<v Speaker 2>single most important catalyst for</v>

2311
02:05:43.531 --> 02:05:48.150
<v Speaker 2>changing consciousness on a global level</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's what has to happen.</v>

2312
02:05:48.390 --> 02:05:52.230
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not saying I have nothing</v>
<v Speaker 2>messianic about it.</v>

2313
02:05:52.231 --> 02:05:53.310
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2314
02:05:53.311 --> 02:05:57.180
<v Speaker 2>I tell people I work for the plants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's valuable to bring</v>

2315
02:05:57.181 --> 02:06:01.710
<v Speaker 2>people to that experience in a place</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is safe.</v>

2316
02:06:01.711 --> 02:06:03.810
<v Speaker 2>They don't have to worry about those</v>
<v Speaker 2>issues.</v>

2317
02:06:04.140 --> 02:06:07.800
<v Speaker 2>They can have this direct download with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mysterious tremendum,</v>

2318
02:06:07.810 --> 02:06:11.280
<v Speaker 2>if you want to call it that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can change hearts and minds.</v>

2319
02:06:11.281 --> 02:06:15.210
<v Speaker 2>I think that globally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that Ios is a catalyst for that.</v>

2320
02:06:15.270 --> 02:06:18.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why has it suddenly gone global in the</v>

2321
02:06:18.901 --> 02:06:21.060
<v Speaker 2>last 20 years?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2322
02:06:21.270 --> 02:06:25.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's a sign that Gaia,</v>

2323
02:06:25.200 --> 02:06:30.200
<v Speaker 2>if you believe in that concept that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>earth itself is an intelligent entity is</v>

2324
02:06:30.781 --> 02:06:34.860
<v Speaker 2>give them a little bit hysterical and is</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to get our attention,</v>

2325
02:06:34.980 --> 02:06:38.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wake up the monkeys and this is the way</v>

2326
02:06:38.701 --> 02:06:42.600
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So ios gives an ambassador from the</v>

2327
02:06:42.601 --> 02:06:47.601
<v Speaker 2>community of species to what I call the</v>
<v Speaker 2>programmatic primates.</v>

2328
02:06:47.970 --> 02:06:52.200
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this out of control species that,</v>

2329
02:06:52.201 --> 02:06:53.160
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>needs,</v>

2330
02:06:53.161 --> 02:06:56.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good talking to say,</v>

2331
02:06:57.630 --> 02:07:00.120
<v Speaker 2>wake up your recognized place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2332
02:07:00.121 --> 02:07:01.650
<v Speaker 2>and you don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2333
02:07:01.651 --> 02:07:02.700
<v Speaker 2>it seems like so</v>

2334
02:07:02.770 --> 02:07:05.710
<v Speaker 1>systems always tried to balance</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves out,</v>

2335
02:07:05.870 --> 02:07:09.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's through warfare or disease</v>

2336
02:07:09.700 --> 02:07:13.990
<v Speaker 1>or some new government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you surfing the old power or whether</v>

2337
02:07:13.991 --> 02:07:18.460
<v Speaker 1>it's through predators and prey and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always some weird sort of</v>

2338
02:07:18.461 --> 02:07:23.461
<v Speaker 1>reaction to some thing gaining too much</v>
<v Speaker 1>power and whether it's ideas or</v>

2339
02:07:24.431 --> 02:07:29.431
<v Speaker 1>ideologies or patterns that they gained</v>
<v Speaker 1>too much power and then something shows</v>

2340
02:07:29.561 --> 02:07:34.390
<v Speaker 1>up that sort of tends to diminish that</v>
<v Speaker 1>erode the very foundation of it.</v>

2341
02:07:34.690 --> 02:07:36.220
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what I feel</v>

2342
02:07:36.220 --> 02:07:41.080
<v Speaker 2>about psychedelics that in many ways</v>
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing and even the sneaky</v>

2343
02:07:41.081 --> 02:07:43.600
<v Speaker 2>door,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the people that talk about cannabis</v>

2344
02:07:43.601 --> 02:07:44.670
<v Speaker 2>being a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2345
02:07:44.770 --> 02:07:49.540
<v Speaker 2>some sort of a gateway drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not a gateway drug to the bad ones.</v>

2346
02:07:49.720 --> 02:07:52.540
<v Speaker 2>I think if anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a gateway drug to the ones that are</v>

2347
02:07:52.541 --> 02:07:56.580
<v Speaker 2>going to change the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it doesn't do it on its own it,</v>

2348
02:07:56.920 --> 02:07:57.460
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2349
02:07:57.460 --> 02:08:02.340
<v Speaker 2>this concept of a gateway drug is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2350
02:08:02.410 --> 02:08:04.490
<v Speaker 2>it's just stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In sense,</v>

2351
02:08:04.690 --> 02:08:08.200
<v Speaker 2>this is something that the drug warriors</v>
<v Speaker 2>have come up with.</v>

2352
02:08:09.400 --> 02:08:10.600
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm here to tell you,</v>

2353
02:08:10.630 --> 02:08:14.470
<v Speaker 2>coffee is a gateway drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Probably chocolate ice cream is a</v>

2354
02:08:15.070 --> 02:08:18.110
<v Speaker 2>gateway drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've all taken these things and you</v>

2355
02:08:18.111 --> 02:08:19.360
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look where we are now.</v>

2356
02:08:19.460 --> 02:08:20.830
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2357
02:08:21.610 --> 02:08:25.510
<v Speaker 2>so gateway drug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just the concept is absurd.</v>

2358
02:08:25.511 --> 02:08:28.090
<v Speaker 2>What's it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If it was sold in the,</v>

2359
02:08:28.180 --> 02:08:32.230
<v Speaker 2>in a environment where there were a</v>
<v Speaker 2>choice to have all sorts of other</v>

2360
02:08:32.231 --> 02:08:34.390
<v Speaker 2>illegal drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't be a gateway drug,</v>

2361
02:08:34.391 --> 02:08:35.224
<v Speaker 2>but it no.</v>

2362
02:08:35.730 --> 02:08:39.460
<v Speaker 2>Well the alcohol one is the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>ridiculous one because it's everywhere</v>

2363
02:08:39.461 --> 02:08:42.700
<v Speaker 2>and it's the one that inhibits your</v>
<v Speaker 2>really loosens your inhibitions more</v>

2364
02:08:42.701 --> 02:08:46.300
<v Speaker 2>than any other drug may is responsible</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the most foolish behavior.</v>

2365
02:08:46.560 --> 02:08:48.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's everywhere.</v>

2366
02:08:48.041 --> 02:08:51.400
<v Speaker 2>You can get it at every restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get it almost everywhere you go</v>

2367
02:08:51.460 --> 02:08:53.350
<v Speaker 2>this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even to the point where it's not even</v>

2368
02:08:53.351 --> 02:08:55.720
<v Speaker 2>recognized as a drug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

2369
02:08:55.810 --> 02:08:59.020
<v Speaker 2>Cognitive dissonance for years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2370
02:08:59.021 --> 02:09:04.021
<v Speaker 2>the FDA could not classify tobacco as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>drug because it was a different</v>

2371
02:09:05.170 --> 02:09:06.490
<v Speaker 2>regulatory framework.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2372
02:09:06.491 --> 02:09:09.190
<v Speaker 2>of course it's a drug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2373
02:09:09.250 --> 02:09:11.110
<v Speaker 2>and somebody said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2374
02:09:11.111 --> 02:09:15.460
<v Speaker 2>it's the only drug you can use when used</v>
<v Speaker 2>as instructed will kill you.</v>

2375
02:09:18.180 --> 02:09:21.820
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it funny that the word drug,</v>

2376
02:09:21.821 --> 02:09:22.680
<v Speaker 2>I'm not funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's,</v>

2377
02:09:22.690 --> 02:09:26.680
<v Speaker 2>isn't it problematic at the very least</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the drug is sort of this gigantic</v>

2378
02:09:26.681 --> 02:09:30.850
<v Speaker 2>blanket that we throw over all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that perturb consciousness,</v>

2379
02:09:31.060 --> 02:09:32.220
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wrong,</v>

2380
02:09:32.330 --> 02:09:35.170
<v Speaker 2>good and bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>positive and negative.</v>

2381
02:09:35.410 --> 02:09:37.960
<v Speaker 2>No beneficial effects whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is,</v>

2382
02:09:38.470 --> 02:09:43.030
<v Speaker 2>this is another reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is another example of why this</v>

2383
02:09:43.031 --> 02:09:48.010
<v Speaker 2>conversation about drugs is so shallow</v>
<v Speaker 2>because we're talking about drugs.</v>

2384
02:09:48.760 --> 02:09:52.450
<v Speaker 2>Completely scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You say people don't use drugs.</v>

2385
02:09:52.630 --> 02:09:57.630
<v Speaker 2>What about what about which drugs?</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we talk about which drugs,</v>

2386
02:09:57.821 --> 02:10:00.940
<v Speaker 2>because there's thousands of drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So which one are we talking about?</v>

2387
02:10:01.120 --> 02:10:05.290
<v Speaker 2>Or we just battled drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just calling them drugs is a problem.</v>

2388
02:10:07.040 --> 02:10:10.360
<v Speaker 2>Could you call dmt the same thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>you call alcohol?</v>

2389
02:10:10.450 --> 02:10:14.770
<v Speaker 2>It seems to me to be so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just not a useful term.</v>

2390
02:10:14.830 --> 02:10:15.663
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2391
02:10:15.760 --> 02:10:17.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then also,</v>

2392
02:10:17.920 --> 02:10:21.670
<v Speaker 2>I mean the problem that they're facing</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that we have to acknowledge,</v>

2393
02:10:21.820 --> 02:10:25.390
<v Speaker 2>which I've been saying a lot lately,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you know,</v>

2394
02:10:25.540 --> 02:10:27.750
<v Speaker 2>we're made of drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2395
02:10:28.350 --> 02:10:29.260
<v Speaker 2>Drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

2396
02:10:29.320 --> 02:10:32.620
<v Speaker 2>We are made of drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2397
02:10:32.680 --> 02:10:37.680
<v Speaker 2>We're biochemical engines that run on</v>
<v Speaker 2>trucks which are neurotransmitters and</v>

2398
02:10:38.841 --> 02:10:42.080
<v Speaker 2>hormones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And enzymes and all of these things and</v>

2399
02:10:42.140 --> 02:10:44.870
<v Speaker 2>biochemical system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're involved with signal</v>

2400
02:10:44.871 --> 02:10:49.760
<v Speaker 2>transduction with organisms are networks</v>
<v Speaker 2>of communication.</v>

2401
02:10:50.120 --> 02:10:53.240
<v Speaker 2>They're mediated by neurotransmitters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>neurotransmitters,</v>

2402
02:10:53.241 --> 02:10:57.410
<v Speaker 2>if you isolated them from the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put them into a bottle and sold them.</v>

2403
02:10:57.470 --> 02:10:59.710
<v Speaker 2>That would be a drug,</v>
<v Speaker 2>will they?</v>

2404
02:10:59.740 --> 02:11:04.340
<v Speaker 2>These are drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this idea that we are inherently</v>

2405
02:11:04.341 --> 02:11:08.900
<v Speaker 2>biochemical systems and people don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to acknowledge that,</v>

2406
02:11:09.530 --> 02:11:11.240
<v Speaker 2>but that's the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2407
02:11:11.241 --> 02:11:15.650
<v Speaker 2>we're made of drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the people that want to have the drug</v>

2408
02:11:15.920 --> 02:11:18.590
<v Speaker 2>free America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

2409
02:11:20.100 --> 02:11:23.930
<v Speaker 2>we're made out of drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Drugs are built into who we are.</v>

2410
02:11:24.010 --> 02:11:29.010
<v Speaker 2>That's why drugs taken from plants or</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the outside have the effects that</v>

2411
02:11:29.091 --> 02:11:30.110
<v Speaker 2>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2412
02:11:30.111 --> 02:11:33.790
<v Speaker 2>because they affect these systems that</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2413
02:11:33.830 --> 02:11:34.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our,</v>

2414
02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:36.620
<v Speaker 2>our big brains.</v>

2415
02:11:36.620 --> 02:11:39.380
<v Speaker 2>This is kind of a consequence of</v>
<v Speaker 2>evolution.</v>

2416
02:11:39.381 --> 02:11:42.320
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have these enormous brains that</v>

2417
02:11:42.330 --> 02:11:45.620
<v Speaker 2>evolved very quickly and we like</v>
<v Speaker 2>novelty.</v>

2418
02:11:45.650 --> 02:11:48.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have all of these brain receptors.</v>

2419
02:11:48.261 --> 02:11:52.250
<v Speaker 2>We like to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd like to stimulate those receptors</v>

2420
02:11:52.251 --> 02:11:57.251
<v Speaker 2>because it makes us feel good or it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting or for all sorts of reasons.</v>

2421
02:11:58.190 --> 02:12:00.980
<v Speaker 2>We like to tweak our states of</v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness.</v>

2422
02:12:01.460 --> 02:12:05.240
<v Speaker 2>It's just built into who we are and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a bad thing.</v>

2423
02:12:05.420 --> 02:12:07.220
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a problem with the way you're</v>

2424
02:12:07.221 --> 02:12:11.420
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have too many facts and use too much</v>

2425
02:12:11.421 --> 02:12:16.340
<v Speaker 2>science and you don't have enough Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jesus in your life.</v>

2426
02:12:16.520 --> 02:12:19.040
<v Speaker 2>If you have Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't need all this nonsense,</v>

2427
02:12:19.230 --> 02:12:21.680
<v Speaker 2>and then that jeff sessions would make</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense to you.</v>

2428
02:12:21.710 --> 02:12:23.150
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That may be true,</v>

2429
02:12:23.210 --> 02:12:26.140
<v Speaker 2>but unfortunately I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

2430
02:12:26.150 --> 02:12:30.440
<v Speaker 2>I'll just continue to be diluted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Believe in science is so important,</v>

2431
02:12:30.450 --> 02:12:33.680
<v Speaker 2>so that makes that so important that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>embraced Jesus and you just</v>

2432
02:12:35.400 --> 02:12:36.230
<v Speaker 2>can't do it.</v>

2433
02:12:36.230 --> 02:12:39.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm a recovering Catholic.</v>

2434
02:12:39.551 --> 02:12:40.820
<v Speaker 2>I've been there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

2435
02:12:40.880 --> 02:12:43.220
<v Speaker 2>I know the drill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know the territory,</v>

2436
02:12:43.660 --> 02:12:46.550
<v Speaker 2>but it's really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In all honesty though,</v>

2437
02:12:46.551 --> 02:12:50.510
<v Speaker 2>it's so important that you are saying</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things so people can change their</v>

2438
02:12:50.511 --> 02:12:51.980
<v Speaker 2>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When they realized that,</v>

2439
02:12:52.010 --> 02:12:54.500
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are really just water balloons of</v>

2440
02:12:54.501 --> 02:12:57.250
<v Speaker 2>drugs were just filled up with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're,</v>

2441
02:12:57.420 --> 02:13:00.950
<v Speaker 2>that's what operates the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That essentially is what we are.</v>

2442
02:13:00.980 --> 02:13:03.350
<v Speaker 2>That's what adrenaline is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All these different things are.</v>

2443
02:13:03.360 --> 02:13:05.720
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say it first.</v>

2444
02:13:05.730 --> 02:13:07.760
<v Speaker 2>You know who said it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was Salvador Dali.</v>

2445
02:13:08.420 --> 02:13:12.140
<v Speaker 2>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so how do you come up with the ideas for</v>

2446
02:13:12.141 --> 02:13:15.920
<v Speaker 2>all these crazy art do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You must be on drugs,</v>

2447
02:13:15.921 --> 02:13:16.491
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>

2448
02:13:16.491 --> 02:13:18.410
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am drugs.</v>

2449
02:13:19.430 --> 02:13:22.430
<v Speaker 2>Which I guess that put the conversation</v>
<v Speaker 2>to an end.</v>

2450
02:13:22.431 --> 02:13:24.620
<v Speaker 2>So if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's quite true.</v>

2451
02:13:25.160 --> 02:13:27.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm speaking of are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2452
02:13:28.070 --> 02:13:30.470
<v Speaker 2>without.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to get too far down this,</v>

2453
02:13:30.471 --> 02:13:33.810
<v Speaker 2>but a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem with organized religion I</v>

2454
02:13:33.811 --> 02:13:37.740
<v Speaker 2>think is that it denies biology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2455
02:13:37.770 --> 02:13:39.360
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The idea of students.</v>

2456
02:13:39.420 --> 02:13:42.090
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somehow being in the body,</v>

2457
02:13:42.150 --> 02:13:47.150
<v Speaker 2>being this chemical system and enjoying</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it is to be that is forbidden</v>

2458
02:13:48.481 --> 02:13:51.120
<v Speaker 2>somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is partly a reflection of our</v>

2459
02:13:52.170 --> 02:13:54.640
<v Speaker 2>devaluation of nature,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2460
02:13:54.840 --> 02:13:57.840
<v Speaker 2>which is at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That includes our own nature as well as</v>

2461
02:13:57.841 --> 02:14:01.860
<v Speaker 2>nature out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Psychedelics are the antidote to this,</v>

2462
02:14:02.250 --> 02:14:04.950
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make you appreciate your</v>

2463
02:14:04.951 --> 02:14:09.951
<v Speaker 2>relationship with nature so they they</v>
<v Speaker 2>can catalyze changes.</v>

2464
02:14:10.350 --> 02:14:14.160
<v Speaker 2>A consciousness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why I say the most effective</v>

2465
02:14:14.161 --> 02:14:19.161
<v Speaker 2>thing that I can do as somebody who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>concerned with the planet is bring</v>

2466
02:14:19.381 --> 02:14:24.381
<v Speaker 2>people to situations where they can</v>
<v Speaker 2>encounter the medicine and make of it</v>

2467
02:14:24.600 --> 02:14:27.120
<v Speaker 2>what they will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm not there to tell them what</v>

2468
02:14:27.121 --> 02:14:27.900
<v Speaker 2>to make of it.</v>

2469
02:14:27.900 --> 02:14:32.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm there to tell them this will be the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most intense personal experience that</v>

2470
02:14:32.341 --> 02:14:36.810
<v Speaker 2>you'll ever have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's up to you how you evaluated it and</v>

2471
02:14:36.811 --> 02:14:38.400
<v Speaker 2>you can't tell them because in all</v>
<v Speaker 2>honesty,</v>

2472
02:14:38.401 --> 02:14:41.190
<v Speaker 2>you're still working out yourself and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm certainly,</v>

2473
02:14:41.191 --> 02:14:45.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't want it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a big believer in use your own mind.</v>

2474
02:14:45.640 --> 02:14:49.350
<v Speaker 2>Use Your own brain to work this out and</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what we have it.</v>

2475
02:14:49.460 --> 02:14:52.080
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's one of the most important things</v>

2476
02:14:52.081 --> 02:14:55.070
<v Speaker 2>about recognizing someone who's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2477
02:14:55.071 --> 02:14:57.870
<v Speaker 2>a quote unquote fake shaman or someone</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's using it wrong.</v>

2478
02:14:58.020 --> 02:15:01.260
<v Speaker 2>Someone is telling you exactly what it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is and what you're going to experience</v>

2479
02:15:01.261 --> 02:15:03.870
<v Speaker 2>like no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the most beautiful things that</v>

2480
02:15:03.871 --> 02:15:07.560
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic drugs do as they dissolve.</v>

2481
02:15:07.561 --> 02:15:10.890
<v Speaker 2>Any notion that you might have that</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone has a hold of this thing.</v>

2482
02:15:10.920 --> 02:15:12.900
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very much so.</v>

2483
02:15:13.020 --> 02:15:17.790
<v Speaker 2>That is exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If somebody tells me I'm a great</v>

2484
02:15:17.791 --> 02:15:20.220
<v Speaker 2>showman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm gonna lead you through this,</v>

2485
02:15:20.221 --> 02:15:22.740
<v Speaker 2>I'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know I'm out of there because they</v>

2486
02:15:22.770 --> 02:15:25.980
<v Speaker 2>obviously have not understood what it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>

2487
02:15:25.980 --> 02:15:30.500
<v Speaker 2>If somebody says I'm not a shop and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>just helped,</v>

2488
02:15:31.110 --> 02:15:33.000
<v Speaker 2>I just held.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to facilitate,</v>

2489
02:15:33.010 --> 02:15:37.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the medicine that there's a shaman</v>

2490
02:15:37.180 --> 02:15:39.870
<v Speaker 2>will say I'm not a showman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just know a few tricks.</v>

2491
02:15:39.990 --> 02:15:42.180
<v Speaker 2>That guy is the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want a drink.</v>

2492
02:15:42.181 --> 02:15:43.830
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just got a few tricks.</v>

2493
02:15:44.580 --> 02:15:45.990
<v Speaker 2>Tricks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have trouble,</v>

2494
02:15:45.991 --> 02:15:48.390
<v Speaker 2>I can help you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise I'll just step back and let</v>

2495
02:15:48.391 --> 02:15:49.470
<v Speaker 2>you do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2496
02:15:49.471 --> 02:15:53.520
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the essential thing because the</v>

2497
02:15:53.580 --> 02:15:56.760
<v Speaker 2>medicine itself is the showman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While I have you here,</v>

2498
02:15:56.790 --> 02:15:59.370
<v Speaker 2>I have to ask you two questions because</v>
<v Speaker 2>I keep forgetting to do this.</v>

2499
02:15:59.440 --> 02:16:00.900
<v Speaker 2>Do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

2500
02:16:00.960 --> 02:16:03.720
<v Speaker 2>cannabinoid receptors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the relationship between</v>

2501
02:16:03.721 --> 02:16:08.721
<v Speaker 2>cannabinoid receptors in human beings</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the actual use of cannabis or the</v>

2502
02:16:09.271 --> 02:16:13.560
<v Speaker 2>evolutionary use of cannabis?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like over the course of human</v>

2503
02:16:13.561 --> 02:16:18.561
<v Speaker 2>development is our cannabinoid receptors</v>
<v Speaker 2>in place because people have consumed</v>

2504
02:16:18.931 --> 02:16:23.070
<v Speaker 2>cannabis throughout history or they had</v>
<v Speaker 2>just a natural function of biology?</v>

2505
02:16:23.280 --> 02:16:25.950
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there a natural function of biology,</v>

2506
02:16:25.980 --> 02:16:27.660
<v Speaker 2>like a lot of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2507
02:16:27.661 --> 02:16:29.770
<v Speaker 2>like opiate receptors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same thing,</v>

2508
02:16:30.880 --> 02:16:35.880
<v Speaker 2>cannabinoid receptors and there are many</v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds and they're all over the body.</v>

2509
02:16:37.091 --> 02:16:39.760
<v Speaker 2>They're not just in the brain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do all sorts of things.</v>

2510
02:16:39.761 --> 02:16:44.140
<v Speaker 2>They're involved with immune functions</v>
<v Speaker 2>and inflammation and it's quite</v>

2511
02:16:44.141 --> 02:16:47.140
<v Speaker 2>complicated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why cbd oil works and it's not</v>

2512
02:16:47.141 --> 02:16:49.960
<v Speaker 2>psychoactive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not psychoactive at works on different</v>

2513
02:16:49.961 --> 02:16:52.300
<v Speaker 2>receptors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's at least three kinds of</v>

2514
02:16:52.570 --> 02:16:57.570
<v Speaker 2>cannabinoid receptors and evolutionarily</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2515
02:16:59.210 --> 02:17:00.011
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2516
02:17:00.011 --> 02:17:04.270
<v Speaker 2>they're not contaminated receptors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's the endocannabinoid system.</v>

2517
02:17:04.271 --> 02:17:08.140
<v Speaker 2>They are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are responsive to things that we</v>

2518
02:17:08.141 --> 02:17:11.950
<v Speaker 2>make in the body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a Nanda mind and there's another</v>

2519
02:17:12.010 --> 02:17:14.530
<v Speaker 2>one who I always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which I always forget,</v>

2520
02:17:14.531 --> 02:17:19.531
<v Speaker 2>but these are indogenous compounds that</v>
<v Speaker 2>bind to cannabinoid receptors,</v>

2521
02:17:19.870 --> 02:17:24.400
<v Speaker 2>so just like their endogenous compounds</v>
<v Speaker 2>that bind to the opiate receptors.</v>

2522
02:17:24.401 --> 02:17:28.180
<v Speaker 2>These are peptides like endorphins and</v>
<v Speaker 2>enkephalins,</v>

2523
02:17:28.290 --> 02:17:30.370
<v Speaker 2>those sorts of things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2524
02:17:31.930 --> 02:17:36.130
<v Speaker 2>but the receptor is just happened to</v>
<v Speaker 2>bind these plant alkaloids,</v>

2525
02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:37.930
<v Speaker 2>but that's not why they evolved.</v>

2526
02:17:38.470 --> 02:17:41.500
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have functions in the body related</v>

2527
02:17:41.501 --> 02:17:43.780
<v Speaker 2>to analgesias and sleep and that sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

2528
02:17:44.140 --> 02:17:48.220
<v Speaker 2>Same with the contaminated receptors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They evolved not because they were</v>

2529
02:17:48.250 --> 02:17:52.810
<v Speaker 2>cannabis plants out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but because the body made these</v>

2530
02:17:53.350 --> 02:17:57.310
<v Speaker 2>endocannabinoids and they mediated all</v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of functions like Amanda,</v>

2531
02:17:57.311 --> 02:17:58.270
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things,</v>

2532
02:17:58.271 --> 02:18:00.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2533
02:18:00.461 --> 02:18:02.440
<v Speaker 2>can I mentally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a little different than something</v>

2534
02:18:02.441 --> 02:18:06.340
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a dmt or Psilocybin,</v>

2535
02:18:06.820 --> 02:18:11.820
<v Speaker 2>which work kind of very specifically on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the serotonin receptors and that's how</v>

2536
02:18:13.391 --> 02:18:16.960
<v Speaker 2>they mediate their effects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The effects of cannabinoids are more</v>

2537
02:18:17.470 --> 02:18:19.960
<v Speaker 2>widespread.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could say more multi,</v>

2538
02:18:19.990 --> 02:18:24.990
<v Speaker 2>multi valence is maybe a good word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's not because the plants were</v>

2539
02:18:26.831 --> 02:18:28.510
<v Speaker 2>there that we've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these things.</v>

2540
02:18:28.511 --> 02:18:31.000
<v Speaker 2>We had this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were neurologically,</v>

2541
02:18:32.650 --> 02:18:36.850
<v Speaker 2>no modern humans you might say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and curious,</v>

2542
02:18:36.851 --> 02:18:39.730
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sampling and everything we could get our</v>

2543
02:18:39.731 --> 02:18:42.460
<v Speaker 2>hands on in the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's stuffing ended up,</v>

2544
02:18:42.461 --> 02:18:45.610
<v Speaker 2>our nose are usually drinking it or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2545
02:18:46.270 --> 02:18:49.510
<v Speaker 2>Naturally you're going to stumble over</v>
<v Speaker 2>these compounds because,</v>

2546
02:18:49.511 --> 02:18:50.590
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2547
02:18:50.800 --> 02:18:55.690
<v Speaker 2>the bio is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is these are just abundant in the bio.</v>

2548
02:18:55.720 --> 02:18:59.170
<v Speaker 2>So it's not really a chicken or the egg</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of situation.</v>

2549
02:18:59.171 --> 02:19:02.140
<v Speaker 2>Like what came first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cannabinoid receptor or the</v>

2550
02:19:02.260 --> 02:19:05.060
<v Speaker 2>consumption of cannabis receptors were</v>
<v Speaker 2>there first.</v>

2551
02:19:05.140 --> 02:19:07.460
<v Speaker 2>How do we know that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2552
02:19:08.080 --> 02:19:11.740
<v Speaker 2>how do we know that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because we can actually trace,</v>

2553
02:19:11.800 --> 02:19:14.260
<v Speaker 2>we can trace the phylogeny of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

2554
02:19:14.290 --> 02:19:18.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have molecular methods now where we</v>

2555
02:19:18.821 --> 02:19:22.420
<v Speaker 2>can actually traits the ancestry of</v>
<v Speaker 2>receptors,</v>

2556
02:19:22.480 --> 02:19:23.920
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

2557
02:19:23.921 --> 02:19:25.900
<v Speaker 2>we have ways to measure this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2558
02:19:26.540 --> 02:19:28.760
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cannabinoid receptors,</v>

2559
02:19:29.030 --> 02:19:31.880
<v Speaker 2>you can look at the phylogeny and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>

2560
02:19:31.881 --> 02:19:36.830
<v Speaker 2>they were present in the president in</v>
<v Speaker 2>mammals long before we were around,</v>

2561
02:19:37.590 --> 02:19:39.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Tryptofan.</v>

2562
02:19:39.610 --> 02:19:41.690
<v Speaker 2>It's the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tryptophan,</v>

2563
02:19:41.691 --> 02:19:43.940
<v Speaker 2>which is the amino acid we were talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

2564
02:19:44.490 --> 02:19:47.270
<v Speaker 2>precursor to many of these psychedelics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2565
02:19:47.720 --> 02:19:51.200
<v Speaker 2>So how old is tripped a fan as an amino</v>
<v Speaker 2>acid?</v>

2566
02:19:51.230 --> 02:19:56.230
<v Speaker 2>You can look back at the phylogeny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>turns out damn old,</v>

2567
02:19:57.830 --> 02:20:02.720
<v Speaker 2>possibly three point 8 billion years</v>
<v Speaker 2>old.</v>

2568
02:20:02.780 --> 02:20:07.780
<v Speaker 2>The genes for Tryptofan have been found</v>
<v Speaker 2>in phylogenetic groups that go back that</v>

2569
02:20:09.801 --> 02:20:11.960
<v Speaker 2>far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The so called trip oppor on.</v>

2570
02:20:12.020 --> 02:20:14.420
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2571
02:20:14.421 --> 02:20:17.420
<v Speaker 2>so these things have been around for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>long time.</v>

2572
02:20:17.750 --> 02:20:18.980
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2573
02:20:18.981 --> 02:20:21.650
<v Speaker 2>in the most primitive organisms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2574
02:20:21.730 --> 02:20:24.550
<v Speaker 2>Serotonin is another good example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Serotonin is,</v>

2575
02:20:25.210 --> 02:20:29.720
<v Speaker 2>which most of the psychedelics work on</v>
<v Speaker 2>Serotonin is thought to be the oldest</v>

2576
02:20:30.020 --> 02:20:34.920
<v Speaker 2>neurotransmitter phylogenetically older</v>
<v Speaker 2>than dopamine and norepinephrine.</v>

2577
02:20:35.330 --> 02:20:37.440
<v Speaker 2>Some of these other things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tryptofan,</v>

2578
02:20:38.030 --> 02:20:42.380
<v Speaker 2>Serotonin is receptors are very old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2579
02:20:42.420 --> 02:20:47.420
<v Speaker 2>phylogenetically evolutionarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how does that correlate with a</v>

2580
02:20:48.620 --> 02:20:50.430
<v Speaker 2>runner's high,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2581
02:20:50.480 --> 02:20:54.080
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when people have this runner's high and</v>

2582
02:20:54.081 --> 02:20:57.620
<v Speaker 2>apparently it has some sort of an effect</v>
<v Speaker 2>on cannabinoid receptors,</v>

2583
02:20:58.070 --> 02:21:01.820
<v Speaker 2>what is going on there and does it</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually mimic the high that someone</v>

2584
02:21:01.821 --> 02:21:03.110
<v Speaker 2>gets from consuming cannabis?</v>

2585
02:21:03.530 --> 02:21:07.700
<v Speaker 2>It May,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard the runner's high discussed</v>

2586
02:21:07.701 --> 02:21:10.400
<v Speaker 2>in terms of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the opiate receptors,</v>

2587
02:21:10.410 --> 02:21:15.410
<v Speaker 2>the endorphin and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe cannabis to what we do know is</v>

2588
02:21:16.251 --> 02:21:21.251
<v Speaker 2>that in states of high stress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can boost the production of these</v>

2589
02:21:22.791 --> 02:21:27.110
<v Speaker 2>indigenous compounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why high stress is one way to</v>

2590
02:21:27.111 --> 02:21:30.170
<v Speaker 2>induce altered states of consciousness</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the match.</v>

2591
02:21:30.200 --> 02:21:31.460
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2592
02:21:31.461 --> 02:21:35.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't need drugs because I can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can run and get high or I can do</v>

2593
02:21:35.751 --> 02:21:38.330
<v Speaker 2>meditation and get high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry dude,</v>

2594
02:21:38.360 --> 02:21:41.290
<v Speaker 2>you're still on drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cars were made,</v>

2595
02:21:41.540 --> 02:21:46.540
<v Speaker 2>were made of drug and he figured out a</v>
<v Speaker 2>way to boost your endogenous DMT</v>

2596
02:21:46.820 --> 02:21:51.440
<v Speaker 2>cannabinoid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when PA getting crazy,</v>

2597
02:21:51.470 --> 02:21:55.580
<v Speaker 2>they're actually in some way doing some</v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of a natural drug trip.</v>

2598
02:21:56.090 --> 02:21:57.230
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Essentially,</v>

2599
02:21:57.231 --> 02:22:02.231
<v Speaker 2>because we are drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no state you can experience</v>

2600
02:22:03.140 --> 02:22:05.540
<v Speaker 2>including the state that we're in right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now,</v>

2601
02:22:05.930 --> 02:22:09.680
<v Speaker 2>that is not a reflection of our</v>
<v Speaker 2>neurochemistry.</v>

2602
02:22:10.760 --> 02:22:13.510
<v Speaker 2>We're in a hallucination right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a,</v>

2603
02:22:13.880 --> 02:22:18.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a reality that our brains take</v>

2604
02:22:18.440 --> 02:22:23.440
<v Speaker 2>information in from the environment</v>
<v Speaker 2>through our sensory neural interface.</v>

2605
02:22:23.721 --> 02:22:28.350
<v Speaker 2>They combine it with</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we know from memories and</v>

2606
02:22:28.351 --> 02:22:31.920
<v Speaker 2>associations and the Cortex,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they essentially create a model of</v>

2607
02:22:31.921 --> 02:22:35.160
<v Speaker 2>reality and that's the reality we're</v>
<v Speaker 2>inhabiting,</v>

2608
02:22:35.190 --> 02:22:37.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of what the brain does,</v>

2609
02:22:37.111 --> 02:22:41.280
<v Speaker 2>it receives information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of the brain's function is to</v>

2610
02:22:41.310 --> 02:22:43.770
<v Speaker 2>filter stuff out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2611
02:22:43.830 --> 02:22:47.520
<v Speaker 2>if we received everything from the</v>
<v Speaker 2>environment all the time,</v>

2612
02:22:47.521 --> 02:22:49.890
<v Speaker 2>we'd be nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We wouldn't be able to take it.</v>

2613
02:22:50.430 --> 02:22:55.430
<v Speaker 2>So there are these gating mechanisms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's called neural gating and we are</v>

2614
02:22:56.400 --> 02:23:00.120
<v Speaker 2>genetically programmed to and through</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience as well,</v>

2615
02:23:00.720 --> 02:23:02.590
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2616
02:23:03.780 --> 02:23:07.800
<v Speaker 2>to have these gating mechanisms that</v>
<v Speaker 2>filters a lot of stuff out so that we</v>

2617
02:23:07.801 --> 02:23:11.460
<v Speaker 2>can function.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise reality would be a blooming</v>

2618
02:23:11.461 --> 02:23:13.320
<v Speaker 2>buzzing confusion all the time.</v>

2619
02:23:13.320 --> 02:23:15.240
<v Speaker 2>We wouldn't be able to focus on</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>

2620
02:23:16.200 --> 02:23:17.920
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of.</v>

2621
02:23:18.030 --> 02:23:21.750
<v Speaker 2>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gating is,</v>

2622
02:23:21.810 --> 02:23:23.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's malleable,</v>

2623
02:23:23.350 --> 02:23:28.350
<v Speaker 2>it can change depending on the input.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're in a crowded restaurant for</v>

2624
02:23:28.441 --> 02:23:29.510
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's,</v>

2625
02:23:29.550 --> 02:23:31.590
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to hear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of noise in the</v>

2626
02:23:31.591 --> 02:23:36.591
<v Speaker 2>background.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You adapt to that by filtering out most</v>

2627
02:23:36.991 --> 02:23:38.430
<v Speaker 2>of what's there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2628
02:23:38.431 --> 02:23:41.550
<v Speaker 2>You just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can suppress it to some degrees so</v>

2629
02:23:41.551 --> 02:23:44.070
<v Speaker 2>you can talk to the person across from</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

2630
02:23:44.071 --> 02:23:45.300
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not paying attention.</v>

2631
02:23:45.690 --> 02:23:49.500
<v Speaker 2>But at the next table you hear somebody</v>
<v Speaker 2>say your name,</v>

2632
02:23:50.130 --> 02:23:53.160
<v Speaker 2>suddenly you're gating mechanism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2633
02:23:53.161 --> 02:23:55.470
<v Speaker 2>you get that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that gets through the filtering</v>

2634
02:23:55.471 --> 02:23:57.600
<v Speaker 2>mechanism itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Somebody is talking to me,</v>

2635
02:23:57.601 --> 02:23:59.550
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what they're saying about me</v>
<v Speaker 2>over there,</v>

2636
02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:01.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing.</v>

2637
02:24:01.261 --> 02:24:05.160
<v Speaker 2>So it relates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a lot of what the brain does when</v>

2638
02:24:05.161 --> 02:24:08.940
<v Speaker 2>you essentially create this</v>
<v Speaker 2>hallucination,</v>

2639
02:24:09.090 --> 02:24:11.270
<v Speaker 2>if you want to call it that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

2640
02:24:11.550 --> 02:24:16.380
<v Speaker 2>of the reality that we inhabit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can call it a model of reality.</v>

2641
02:24:16.440 --> 02:24:20.790
<v Speaker 2>It's not reality itself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a reasonable facsimile of reality</v>

2642
02:24:20.791 --> 02:24:23.550
<v Speaker 2>that we inhabit and everybody's is</v>
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>

2643
02:24:23.580 --> 02:24:26.160
<v Speaker 2>Hence different views.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone is different,</v>

2644
02:24:26.161 --> 02:24:29.490
<v Speaker 2>but close enough that we can talk to</v>
<v Speaker 2>each other and all that.</v>

2645
02:24:29.491 --> 02:24:30.180
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2646
02:24:30.180 --> 02:24:34.920
<v Speaker 2>But it's not the pure objective reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2647
02:24:34.921 --> 02:24:38.010
<v Speaker 2>which doesn't really exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it exists out there,</v>

2648
02:24:38.011 --> 02:24:40.830
<v Speaker 2>but we don't know what it looks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't exist to humans doesn't</v>

2649
02:24:40.831 --> 02:24:42.870
<v Speaker 2>exist to us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't perceive it.</v>

2650
02:24:42.960 --> 02:24:45.060
<v Speaker 2>We receive our own art,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2651
02:24:45.061 --> 02:24:50.061
<v Speaker 2>our own a model essentially of reality</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think you explaining that</v>

2652
02:24:52.560 --> 02:24:57.560
<v Speaker 2>different experiences create literally</v>
<v Speaker 2>drug trips also can explain love affairs</v>

2653
02:24:58.680 --> 02:25:03.000
<v Speaker 2>where people become incredibly addicted</v>
<v Speaker 2>to each other and addicted to the</v>

2654
02:25:03.001 --> 02:25:07.680
<v Speaker 2>experience of being around the person</v>
<v Speaker 2>and what that does to you and that</v>

2655
02:25:07.681 --> 02:25:10.560
<v Speaker 2>literally you are on drugs when you were</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone of course.</v>

2656
02:25:10.650 --> 02:25:12.840
<v Speaker 2>And you know that's been studied,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2657
02:25:12.840 --> 02:25:16.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean oxytocin and probably opiate</v>

2658
02:25:16.730 --> 02:25:21.730
<v Speaker 2>movies in Saratoga mean all of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>things are part of what mediates</v>

2659
02:25:23.480 --> 02:25:25.690
<v Speaker 2>relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including sex hormones.</v>

2660
02:25:26.370 --> 02:25:28.120
<v Speaker 2>So all of those things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of those things,</v>

2661
02:25:28.210 --> 02:25:31.150
<v Speaker 2>sex hormones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tour psychoactive drugs in a certain</v>

2662
02:25:31.151 --> 02:25:32.890
<v Speaker 2>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is not to say,</v>

2663
02:25:32.950 --> 02:25:37.780
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is not saying that these</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences are genuine or valuable or</v>

2664
02:25:37.781 --> 02:25:40.810
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are obviously,</v>

2665
02:25:40.990 --> 02:25:43.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>personal relationships are important.</v>

2666
02:25:44.220 --> 02:25:49.220
<v Speaker 2>It is not a to my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not an evaluation to say we'll it's</v>

2667
02:25:49.661 --> 02:25:51.640
<v Speaker 2>chemically mediated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

2668
02:25:51.700 --> 02:25:53.260
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's chemically mediated.</v>

2669
02:25:53.261 --> 02:25:56.080
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make it invalid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

2670
02:25:56.081 --> 02:25:57.460
<v Speaker 2>it means that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2671
02:25:57.520 --> 02:26:00.660
<v Speaker 2>these molecules are pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't do that.</v>

2672
02:26:01.030 --> 02:26:02.590
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the feeling is fantastic.</v>

2673
02:26:02.591 --> 02:26:04.750
<v Speaker 2>Like why would that invalidate it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's still real.</v>

2674
02:26:04.751 --> 02:26:06.610
<v Speaker 2>It's still awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but people,</v>

2675
02:26:06.670 --> 02:26:07.900
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2676
02:26:07.901 --> 02:26:10.930
<v Speaker 2>they have these artificial distinctions</v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

2677
02:26:10.931 --> 02:26:11.870
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2678
02:26:12.130 --> 02:26:17.130
<v Speaker 2>my mystical experiences more valuable</v>
<v Speaker 2>than yours because you had to have</v>

2679
02:26:17.321 --> 02:26:19.800
<v Speaker 2>silicide and then I got there on that</v>
<v Speaker 2>couch,</v>

2680
02:26:20.470 --> 02:26:22.570
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't on the match.</v>

2681
02:26:22.720 --> 02:26:24.880
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're still a prisoner of your</v>

2682
02:26:24.881 --> 02:26:26.560
<v Speaker 2>neurochemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No matter what.</v>

2683
02:26:26.830 --> 02:26:31.830
<v Speaker 2>It just so happens that silicide been,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it drug taken in the right</v>

2684
02:26:31.961 --> 02:26:36.010
<v Speaker 2>circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the right amount will reliably induce</v>

2685
02:26:36.011 --> 02:26:39.430
<v Speaker 2>a mystical experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nothing wrong with that.</v>

2686
02:26:40.810 --> 02:26:42.490
<v Speaker 2>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could even study it.</v>

2687
02:26:42.491 --> 02:26:46.750
<v Speaker 2>Suddenly science can study mystical</v>
<v Speaker 2>experiences because we have a reliable</v>

2688
02:26:46.751 --> 02:26:51.700
<v Speaker 2>trigger that will nine times out of 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>induce mystical experience in the right</v>

2689
02:26:51.701 --> 02:26:54.110
<v Speaker 2>circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then we can take somebody.</v>

2690
02:26:55.140 --> 02:26:57.880
<v Speaker 2>Maybe somebody is meditated for 20</v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

2691
02:26:57.881 --> 02:27:01.930
<v Speaker 2>are done yoga or done other things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hoping that they might have a mystical</v>

2692
02:27:01.931 --> 02:27:04.660
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good for them,</v>

2693
02:27:04.960 --> 02:27:08.830
<v Speaker 2>but then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can take me an ordinary schmuck or</v>

2694
02:27:08.831 --> 02:27:11.200
<v Speaker 2>somebody like me who hasn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>particularly,</v>

2695
02:27:11.230 --> 02:27:16.230
<v Speaker 2>not particularly spiritually evolved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I can take solace Simon then.</v>

2696
02:27:16.450 --> 02:27:17.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it works.</v>

2697
02:27:18.100 --> 02:27:23.050
<v Speaker 1>That reminds me of a great story that</v>
<v Speaker 1>your brother told once about a,</v>

2698
02:27:23.110 --> 02:27:26.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a monk who studied a city of levitation</v>

2699
02:27:26.830 --> 02:27:30.940
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did it for like 30 years and then met</v>

2700
02:27:30.941 --> 02:27:32.920
<v Speaker 1>the Buddha and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2701
02:27:32.921 --> 02:27:36.190
<v Speaker 1>I can walk on water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've studied the city of levitation for</v>

2702
02:27:36.191 --> 02:27:38.290
<v Speaker 1>30 years and now I can walk across the</v>
<v Speaker 1>river.</v>

2703
02:27:38.650 --> 02:27:39.490
<v Speaker 1>And the Buddhist said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2704
02:27:39.491 --> 02:27:41.050
<v Speaker 1>but the ferries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only a nickel</v>

2705
02:27:46.260 --> 02:27:47.110
<v Speaker 1>30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2706
02:27:47.410 --> 02:27:51.130
<v Speaker 1>you could've just taken mushrooms for</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking of mushrooms is this is</v>

2707
02:27:51.131 --> 02:27:53.350
<v Speaker 1>something that I get wrong all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the other things I wanted to</v>

2708
02:27:53.351 --> 02:27:54.250
<v Speaker 1>ask you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

2709
02:27:54.730 --> 02:27:55.630
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2710
02:27:55.690 --> 02:28:00.690
<v Speaker 1>there's some very close relationship</v>
<v Speaker 1>that mushrooms have and the absorption</v>

2711
02:28:01.031 --> 02:28:03.800
<v Speaker 1>of mushrooms have to dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

2712
02:28:03.820 --> 02:28:07.780
<v Speaker 1>what is the chemical differentiation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2713
02:28:07.810 --> 02:28:08.480
<v Speaker 1>Very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

2714
02:28:08.480 --> 02:28:10.660
<v Speaker 2>very slight actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2715
02:28:13.550 --> 02:28:18.230
<v Speaker 2>the temptation to start drawing</v>
<v Speaker 2>structures is almost irresistible.</v>

2716
02:28:18.231 --> 02:28:19.430
<v Speaker 2>Write some stuff down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go ahead.</v>

2717
02:28:20.310 --> 02:28:21.143
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here has,</v>

2718
02:28:21.410 --> 02:28:22.640
<v Speaker 2>do we have a visual?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now?</v>

2719
02:28:22.641 --> 02:28:24.440
<v Speaker 2>We don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'll save that piece of paper.</v>

2720
02:28:24.441 --> 02:28:25.880
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2721
02:28:26.120 --> 02:28:28.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to get too far into it,</v>

2722
02:28:28.911 --> 02:28:30.440
<v Speaker 2>but basically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2723
02:28:30.441 --> 02:28:34.940
<v Speaker 2>So you've had organic chemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

2724
02:28:34.970 --> 02:28:35.860
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2725
02:28:37.160 --> 02:28:41.060
<v Speaker 2>Well then this spam organic chemistry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are what you are.</v>

2726
02:28:41.061 --> 02:28:43.910
<v Speaker 2>Organic Chemistry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well this may be a useless thing,</v>

2727
02:28:43.911 --> 02:28:47.810
<v Speaker 2>but</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could see it up on the wall here.</v>

2728
02:28:47.840 --> 02:28:49.340
<v Speaker 2>We've got it up on the screen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2729
02:28:49.490 --> 02:28:50.770
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2730
02:28:50.771 --> 02:28:52.400
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there you go.</v>

2731
02:28:52.460 --> 02:28:53.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't have to draw,</v>

2732
02:28:53.490 --> 02:28:55.130
<v Speaker 2>Struck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can look at it right here so you</v>

2733
02:28:55.131 --> 02:28:56.990
<v Speaker 2>don't have to turn around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look to your right Dennis.</v>

2734
02:28:57.000 --> 02:28:58.480
<v Speaker 2>Turn test.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2735
02:28:59.210 --> 02:29:00.500
<v Speaker 2>so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2736
02:29:00.920 --> 02:29:03.980
<v Speaker 2>So you can see if you've.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's Serotonin,</v>

2737
02:29:03.981 --> 02:29:06.020
<v Speaker 2>silicon and dimethyl trip to me.</v>

2738
02:29:06.020 --> 02:29:09.280
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see that silicon and domiciled</v>

2739
02:29:09.450 --> 02:29:11.930
<v Speaker 2>trip to Maine are very close in</v>
<v Speaker 2>structure.</v>

2740
02:29:11.931 --> 02:29:14.210
<v Speaker 2>The only difference is that hydroxy</v>
<v Speaker 2>group,</v>

2741
02:29:14.810 --> 02:29:17.030
<v Speaker 2>that age group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the only difference.</v>

2742
02:29:17.031 --> 02:29:21.350
<v Speaker 2>So with the silicon is exactly the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing as an end dimethyltryptamine.</v>

2743
02:29:21.380 --> 02:29:25.940
<v Speaker 2>That's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why that single trivial difference is</v>

2744
02:29:25.941 --> 02:29:30.410
<v Speaker 2>what makes tillison orally active and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm a whole trip to mean there's not.</v>

2745
02:29:30.530 --> 02:29:32.750
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

2746
02:29:32.751 --> 02:29:37.751
<v Speaker 2>Because what's going on with that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This static diagram,</v>

2747
02:29:38.230 --> 02:29:41.320
<v Speaker 2>the different molecular model would show</v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

2748
02:29:41.330 --> 02:29:45.920
<v Speaker 2>but what's going on is that that</v>
<v Speaker 2>nitrogen there in when tillison's and</v>

2749
02:29:46.100 --> 02:29:50.870
<v Speaker 2>physiological solution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nitrogen is charged,</v>

2750
02:29:51.080 --> 02:29:55.450
<v Speaker 2>has a positive charge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The oxygen doesn't have the h there,</v>

2751
02:29:55.460 --> 02:30:00.460
<v Speaker 2>it has a negative charge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the nitrogen curls back and is in</v>

2752
02:30:02.121 --> 02:30:07.121
<v Speaker 2>close association with the oxygen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If this makes any sense,</v>

2753
02:30:07.890 --> 02:30:12.890
<v Speaker 2>so the enzyme can't get to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's orally active because</v>

2754
02:30:13.011 --> 02:30:15.320
<v Speaker 2>essentially it can't get to that</v>
<v Speaker 2>nitrogen.</v>

2755
02:30:15.740 --> 02:30:18.950
<v Speaker 2>What that enzyme does is cleave off that</v>
<v Speaker 2>nitrogen,</v>

2756
02:30:18.951 --> 02:30:23.951
<v Speaker 2>mano aiming oxidase.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It takes away that nitrogen and it can't</v>

2757
02:30:24.921 --> 02:30:27.280
<v Speaker 2>do it with allison,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's why I sold.</v>

2758
02:30:27.281 --> 02:30:29.810
<v Speaker 2>Listens orally active.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't require in them mail</v>

2759
02:30:29.900 --> 02:30:33.050
<v Speaker 2>inhibitor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just in some ways it's the perfect</v>

2760
02:30:33.051 --> 02:30:35.210
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic because it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2761
02:30:35.390 --> 02:30:39.110
<v Speaker 2>no preparation needed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just bend over and pick the</v>

2762
02:30:39.111 --> 02:30:41.750
<v Speaker 2>mushroom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll preparation is required,</v>

2763
02:30:41.751 --> 02:30:46.751
<v Speaker 2>which is probably why very ancient man</v>
<v Speaker 2>knew about psilocybin.</v>

2764
02:30:47.670 --> 02:30:49.760
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They couldn't not have,</v>

2765
02:30:49.790 --> 02:30:54.050
<v Speaker 2>if they were living in an environment</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it was found.</v>

2766
02:30:55.190 --> 02:30:56.150
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2767
02:30:56.151 --> 02:30:58.150
<v Speaker 2>what's really incredible is that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2768
02:30:58.280 --> 02:31:03.280
<v Speaker 2>people are using suicide and these days</v>
<v Speaker 2>in what they call micro dosing,</v>

2769
02:31:04.010 --> 02:31:07.550
<v Speaker 2>taking very small doses and seeing these</v>
<v Speaker 2>profound benefits.</v>

2770
02:31:07.840 --> 02:31:10.820
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that I'm aware of is</v>

2771
02:31:10.821 --> 02:31:15.740
<v Speaker 2>kickboxers are using it and kick boxers</v>
<v Speaker 2>are using it in a good buddy of mine is</v>

2772
02:31:15.741 --> 02:31:18.200
<v Speaker 2>using.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It says that he can see things happen</v>

2773
02:31:18.201 --> 02:31:20.310
<v Speaker 2>before they happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And like it was almost like he's reading</v>

2774
02:31:20.310 --> 02:31:24.940
<v Speaker 1>people's minds before they're about to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do something even on micro toast.</v>

2775
02:31:24.970 --> 02:31:27.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's very interesting in the intense</v>

2776
02:31:27.991 --> 02:31:30.270
<v Speaker 1>environment of sparring and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the,</v>

2777
02:31:30.271 --> 02:31:34.110
<v Speaker 1>the intense physical Connecticut</v>
<v Speaker 1>interaction of kickboxing is that he's</v>

2778
02:31:34.111 --> 02:31:36.480
<v Speaker 1>seeing what people are going to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>before they do it in a way that he's</v>

2779
02:31:36.481 --> 02:31:39.240
<v Speaker 1>never able to do quote unquote on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>notch.</v>

2780
02:31:39.780 --> 02:31:40.620
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2781
02:31:40.621 --> 02:31:42.330
<v Speaker 1>I'm not surprised at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2782
02:31:42.340 --> 02:31:44.130
<v Speaker 1>and why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why aren't you surprised?</v>

2783
02:31:44.131 --> 02:31:45.270
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think is happening?</v>

2784
02:31:46.240 --> 02:31:49.240
<v Speaker 2>Because I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2785
02:31:49.241 --> 02:31:53.770
<v Speaker 2>these things let you step out of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>box a little bit.</v>

2786
02:31:53.800 --> 02:31:58.800
<v Speaker 2>They let you step out of your usual</v>
<v Speaker 2>reference frame and notice things going</v>

2787
02:31:58.811 --> 02:32:02.770
<v Speaker 2>on in the environment that again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this gating mechanism you were talking</v>

2788
02:32:02.771 --> 02:32:05.050
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're programmed to filter stuff out.</v>

2789
02:32:05.560 --> 02:32:10.560
<v Speaker 2>Psychedelics temporarily disrupt that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They let the background come forward and</v>

2790
02:32:10.871 --> 02:32:14.110
<v Speaker 2>you notice things about the environment</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we're,</v>

2791
02:32:14.250 --> 02:32:18.550
<v Speaker 2>that normally you would suppress because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not relevant to immediate</v>

2792
02:32:18.670 --> 02:32:22.480
<v Speaker 2>survival.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've read some of the</v>

2793
02:32:22.481 --> 02:32:26.470
<v Speaker 2>work by Simon Powell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wrote the silicide been the solution.</v>

2794
02:32:26.530 --> 02:32:29.500
<v Speaker 2>He writes very intelligently about</v>
<v Speaker 2>psilocybin.</v>

2795
02:32:30.430 --> 02:32:33.430
<v Speaker 2>In this latest book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Magic Mushroom Explorer,</v>

2796
02:32:33.431 --> 02:32:38.431
<v Speaker 2>he talks about how psilocybin is a lens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Essentially you can think of it as a</v>

2797
02:32:41.021 --> 02:32:46.021
<v Speaker 2>lens through which you can look at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

2798
02:32:46.151 --> 02:32:51.151
<v Speaker 2>You can look at natural phenomena and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will notice things about that,</v>

2799
02:32:51.640 --> 02:32:55.180
<v Speaker 2>those phenomena that you normally</v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't overlook because we're</v>

2800
02:32:55.181 --> 02:32:56.140
<v Speaker 2>programmed to do it.</v>

2801
02:32:56.140 --> 02:32:59.500
<v Speaker 2>So in a sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he talks about how silicide but is a</v>

2802
02:32:59.501 --> 02:33:01.270
<v Speaker 2>scientific instrument.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2803
02:33:01.300 --> 02:33:05.590
<v Speaker 2>it's a lens through which you can look</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the world and see aspects of it that</v>

2804
02:33:05.591 --> 02:33:08.800
<v Speaker 2>are always there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you've never noticed them before</v>

2805
02:33:08.801 --> 02:33:11.350
<v Speaker 2>because we're programmed not to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

2806
02:33:11.810 --> 02:33:13.270
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2807
02:33:13.300 --> 02:33:18.250
<v Speaker 2>Kary Mullis is famous because his</v>
<v Speaker 2>discoveries in molecular biology,</v>

2808
02:33:18.251 --> 02:33:23.251
<v Speaker 2>he attributes to his insights about</v>
<v Speaker 2>molecular processes that he got from lsd</v>

2809
02:33:25.600 --> 02:33:29.800
<v Speaker 2>that he could get down with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>molecules as he put it and see how all</v>

2810
02:33:29.801 --> 02:33:34.460
<v Speaker 2>this is working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And obviously he invented a preliminary</v>

2811
02:33:34.570 --> 02:33:37.050
<v Speaker 2>chain reaction which she got the Nobel</v>
<v Speaker 2>prize for.</v>

2812
02:33:37.660 --> 02:33:42.310
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like this is a delusion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a real thing that he was able to</v>

2813
02:33:42.311 --> 02:33:44.920
<v Speaker 2>notice that no one else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying?</v>

2814
02:33:44.921 --> 02:33:49.270
<v Speaker 2>He was able to put himself in a place</v>
<v Speaker 2>where he could notice these phenomenon.</v>

2815
02:33:49.360 --> 02:33:51.880
<v Speaker 2>And I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's really true.</v>

2816
02:33:51.880 --> 02:33:56.200
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go to take a walk in the forest</v>

2817
02:33:56.201 --> 02:33:58.370
<v Speaker 2>with an indigenous person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2818
02:33:58.390 --> 02:34:03.390
<v Speaker 2>who in some ways as in this less of this</v>
<v Speaker 2>sensory gating in a more open place all</v>

2819
02:34:05.981 --> 02:34:09.310
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They will notice things about the</v>

2820
02:34:09.311 --> 02:34:10.990
<v Speaker 2>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2821
02:34:11.110 --> 02:34:16.110
<v Speaker 2>that you are completely oblivious to</v>
<v Speaker 2>until they pointed out,</v>

2822
02:34:16.720 --> 02:34:17.830
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they'll say,</v>

2823
02:34:17.831 --> 02:34:20.980
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never noticed the leaf cutter ants are</v>

2824
02:34:20.981 --> 02:34:23.710
<v Speaker 2>behaving this way or these different</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

2825
02:34:24.550 --> 02:34:29.550
<v Speaker 2>Their sensory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a sort of experience of a environment</v>

2826
02:34:30.490 --> 02:34:35.490
<v Speaker 2>like the forest is very different than</v>
<v Speaker 2>ours because we're used to.</v>

2827
02:34:36.340 --> 02:34:38.920
<v Speaker 2>We're just not out in nature the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

2828
02:34:38.921 --> 02:34:43.921
<v Speaker 2>And I daresay I think one of the things</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in some ways inserts a barrier</v>

2829
02:34:45.551 --> 02:34:48.370
<v Speaker 2>between us is literacy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2830
02:34:48.400 --> 02:34:50.170
<v Speaker 2>we're all literate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2831
02:34:50.260 --> 02:34:53.620
<v Speaker 2>And we like being literate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's good that we're literate,</v>

2832
02:34:54.310 --> 02:34:58.390
<v Speaker 2>but in order to be literate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to have this separation between</v>

2833
02:34:58.391 --> 02:35:01.300
<v Speaker 2>the self and the external environment.</v>

2834
02:35:01.300 --> 02:35:04.330
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to pick up a book and read it.</v>

2835
02:35:04.690 --> 02:35:06.610
<v Speaker 2>I am here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the point of view.</v>

2836
02:35:06.611 --> 02:35:08.470
<v Speaker 2>Here's the book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2837
02:35:08.500 --> 02:35:13.500
<v Speaker 2>so that creates that relationship and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you sacrifice,</v>

2838
02:35:14.650 --> 02:35:19.650
<v Speaker 2>you focus on one particular sensory</v>
<v Speaker 2>modality and you sacrifice all the other</v>

2839
02:35:20.081 --> 02:35:24.640
<v Speaker 2>input that is coming up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I'm making say no,</v>

2840
02:35:24.641 --> 02:35:26.080
<v Speaker 2>you absolutely are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You absolutely are.</v>

2841
02:35:26.110 --> 02:35:27.280
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>

2842
02:35:27.370 --> 02:35:32.370
<v Speaker 2>that's what these substances can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can essentially reverse this</v>

2843
02:35:34.130 --> 02:35:39.130
<v Speaker 2>background foreground relationship that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're so used to suddenly what's right</v>

2844
02:35:40.211 --> 02:35:44.980
<v Speaker 2>in front of you is not so important and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can pay attention to the things in</v>

2845
02:35:44.981 --> 02:35:49.240
<v Speaker 2>the background that you're normally your</v>
<v Speaker 2>program to suppress and ignore because,</v>

2846
02:35:49.750 --> 02:35:52.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to be ready for the saber tooth</v>

2847
02:35:52.420 --> 02:35:54.260
<v Speaker 2>tiger to come across,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2848
02:35:54.280 --> 02:35:57.550
<v Speaker 2>over the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mountain or whatever,</v>

2849
02:35:57.850 --> 02:35:59.020
<v Speaker 2>you know what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

2850
02:35:59.980 --> 02:36:03.370
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's good in that sense.</v>

2851
02:36:03.400 --> 02:36:07.570
<v Speaker 2>They teach different ways of perception,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2852
02:36:07.630 --> 02:36:10.210
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's a very useful thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>to learn.</v>

2853
02:36:10.600 --> 02:36:13.030
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>indigenous people call these</v>

2854
02:36:13.031 --> 02:36:16.930
<v Speaker 2>psychedelics plant teachers and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>call them teachers for a reason.</v>

2855
02:36:17.910 --> 02:36:19.780
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much of the,</v>

2856
02:36:20.740 --> 02:36:24.040
<v Speaker 2>what you experienced comes directly from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the experience.</v>

2857
02:36:24.041 --> 02:36:28.240
<v Speaker 2>But much of it also comes from your</v>
<v Speaker 2>change perception.</v>

2858
02:36:28.241 --> 02:36:31.570
<v Speaker 2>And suddenly you realize there's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>different way to be in the world.</v>

2859
02:36:31.600 --> 02:36:36.600
<v Speaker 2>There's a different way to perceive what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you experienced that normally you don't.</v>

2860
02:36:39.190 --> 02:36:40.090
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2861
02:36:40.210 --> 02:36:45.210
<v Speaker 2>we're programmed to filter out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you've ever read or had</v>

2862
02:36:45.710 --> 02:36:48.340
<v Speaker 2>Stephen Buhner on your show.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2863
02:36:48.760 --> 02:36:51.460
<v Speaker 2>He writes very intelligently about this</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>

2864
02:36:51.461 --> 02:36:55.960
<v Speaker 2>He's written a book called a plant</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence on the imaginal realm,</v>

2865
02:36:56.800 --> 02:37:00.010
<v Speaker 2>and it's all about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2866
02:37:00.610 --> 02:37:01.443
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2867
02:37:02.650 --> 02:37:07.270
<v Speaker 2>essentially let his rap is you can learn</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2868
02:37:07.300 --> 02:37:09.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can learn this way of perceiving</v>

2869
02:37:09.580 --> 02:37:11.560
<v Speaker 2>whether you do it with psychedelics or</v>
<v Speaker 2>not.</v>

2870
02:37:11.640 --> 02:37:16.310
<v Speaker 2>You can actually learn it and it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an interesting.</v>

2871
02:37:16.730 --> 02:37:21.730
<v Speaker 2>It's a better way to relate to nature or</v>
<v Speaker 2>more an alternative way to relate to the</v>

2872
02:37:22.030 --> 02:37:26.330
<v Speaker 2>insured in any way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like we have these pre assumed</v>

2873
02:37:26.350 --> 02:37:30.050
<v Speaker 2>definitions of things that we rely upon</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of seeing things for what they</v>

2874
02:37:30.051 --> 02:37:31.870
<v Speaker 2>really are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you,</v>

2875
02:37:32.080 --> 02:37:33.320
<v Speaker 2>you Kinda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2876
02:37:33.321 --> 02:37:35.630
<v Speaker 2>You box them up and you package them and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

2877
02:37:35.660 --> 02:37:37.220
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well there's a car,</v>

2878
02:37:37.380 --> 02:37:39.530
<v Speaker 2>there is a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then one day you look at the car and</v>

2879
02:37:39.531 --> 02:37:43.430
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a box that has a controlled</v>

2880
02:37:43.431 --> 02:37:48.431
<v Speaker 2>explosion in cased in iron and that</v>
<v Speaker 2>rules on rubber tires and see exactly</v>

2881
02:37:48.621 --> 02:37:51.590
<v Speaker 2>what they're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a different way to look at</v>

2882
02:37:51.591 --> 02:37:54.690
<v Speaker 2>things if you step out of the box.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yes,</v>

2883
02:37:54.691 --> 02:37:59.240
<v Speaker 2>it is all those things and it's also a</v>
<v Speaker 2>car and it's good if you did that all</v>

2884
02:37:59.241 --> 02:38:00.560
<v Speaker 2>the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd never get anything done.</v>

2885
02:38:00.650 --> 02:38:03.170
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

2886
02:38:03.290 --> 02:38:05.480
<v Speaker 2>But I mean it's interesting in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>respect,</v>

2887
02:38:05.481 --> 02:38:08.030
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with psychedelics,</v>

2888
02:38:09.560 --> 02:38:13.090
<v Speaker 2>because we're verbal people and we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2889
02:38:13.120 --> 02:38:17.150
<v Speaker 2>were inhabited,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inhabited world of language as much as</v>

2890
02:38:17.151 --> 02:38:22.151
<v Speaker 2>the physical world and we're almost</v>
<v Speaker 2>compelled to try to put some kind of</v>

2891
02:38:23.810 --> 02:38:28.810
<v Speaker 2>linguistic wrapper over everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And which is one reason why if you smoke</v>

2892
02:38:30.081 --> 02:38:31.340
<v Speaker 2>DMT,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2893
02:38:31.341 --> 02:38:34.910
<v Speaker 2>you have a complete revelation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

2894
02:38:34.911 --> 02:38:39.911
<v Speaker 2>That's all of these things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's in most cases you aren't even</v>

2895
02:38:42.200 --> 02:38:47.200
<v Speaker 2>down yet before you're trying to explain</v>
<v Speaker 2>it to yourself.</v>

2896
02:38:47.390 --> 02:38:50.060
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're trying to stuff this thing in a</v>

2897
02:38:50.061 --> 02:38:55.061
<v Speaker 2>box because it was so impactful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's inherently in the EFL bowl.</v>

2898
02:38:55.790 --> 02:38:58.130
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't really describe it in</v>

2899
02:38:58.131 --> 02:39:03.131
<v Speaker 2>language,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but boy is there a desire to somehow</v>

2900
02:39:03.950 --> 02:39:07.520
<v Speaker 2>tame this thing which is</v>
<v Speaker 2>incomprehensible,</v>

2901
02:39:07.521 --> 02:39:11.540
<v Speaker 2>totally transcendent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that doesn't stop you from rapping</v>

2902
02:39:11.541 --> 02:39:16.541
<v Speaker 2>about it immediately to try to stuff it</v>
<v Speaker 2>into a box because it's too impactful.</v>

2903
02:39:18.140 --> 02:39:20.870
<v Speaker 2>And so on the individual level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what people do.</v>

2904
02:39:20.871 --> 02:39:23.590
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what religions do too,</v>

2905
02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:26.780
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They try to take something like this and</v>

2906
02:39:26.781 --> 02:39:29.720
<v Speaker 2>stuff it into a box because in and of</v>
<v Speaker 2>itself,</v>

2907
02:39:30.080 --> 02:39:33.200
<v Speaker 2>without that wrapping or that</v>
<v Speaker 2>linguistic,</v>

2908
02:39:33.850 --> 02:39:38.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>filters to somehow tame it and,</v>

2909
02:39:39.470 --> 02:39:40.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nullify,</v>

2910
02:39:40.791 --> 02:39:44.240
<v Speaker 2>neutralize its power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These things are very dangerous.</v>

2911
02:39:44.490 --> 02:39:46.400
<v Speaker 2>There are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there also seems to be some sort of a</v>

2912
02:39:46.401 --> 02:39:49.550
<v Speaker 2>physiological component to the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2913
02:39:49.551 --> 02:39:54.551
<v Speaker 2>the DMT trip where once it's over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have a very limited amount of time</v>

2914
02:39:55.190 --> 02:39:57.740
<v Speaker 2>to hang onto those memories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

2915
02:39:57.770 --> 02:39:58.760
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>

2916
02:39:59.060 --> 02:40:04.060
<v Speaker 2>So this is an attempt to entrain that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to grab it and I think put a linguistic,</v>

2917
02:40:05.080 --> 02:40:06.230
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2918
02:40:06.560 --> 02:40:11.560
<v Speaker 2>tag on a certain way so that as a way to</v>
<v Speaker 2>not forget it or,</v>

2919
02:40:12.460 --> 02:40:14.150
<v Speaker 2>or try and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2920
02:40:14.250 --> 02:40:18.420
<v Speaker 2>both reduce its power but give you</v>
<v Speaker 2>something to hang on because right.</v>

2921
02:40:18.960 --> 02:40:22.800
<v Speaker 2>The memory and flooded actually is it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to fade very rapidly.</v>

2922
02:40:22.801 --> 02:40:24.000
<v Speaker 2>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is,</v>

2923
02:40:24.090 --> 02:40:27.870
<v Speaker 2>what's the physiological.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the physiological.</v>

2924
02:40:27.871 --> 02:40:30.690
<v Speaker 2>It's like a lot like dreams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dreams.</v>

2925
02:40:30.780 --> 02:40:33.510
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot like dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's just,</v>

2926
02:40:34.770 --> 02:40:36.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a,</v>

2927
02:40:36.900 --> 02:40:41.900
<v Speaker 2>it's something like that you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably train yourself to remember it</v>

2928
02:40:42.090 --> 02:40:44.430
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like people can train themselves to</v>

2929
02:40:44.431 --> 02:40:46.870
<v Speaker 2>remember their dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2930
02:40:47.040 --> 02:40:49.160
<v Speaker 2>but it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's ephemeral,</v>

2931
02:40:49.260 --> 02:40:51.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does tend to evaporate,</v>

2932
02:40:51.960 --> 02:40:56.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why it's important to go to the</v>

2933
02:40:56.311 --> 02:40:59.150
<v Speaker 2>well once in a file and take a drink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2934
02:40:59.370 --> 02:41:02.760
<v Speaker 2>I am not one of these people that says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you get the message,</v>

2935
02:41:02.761 --> 02:41:06.750
<v Speaker 2>hang up the phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a model that doesn't work for me.</v>

2936
02:41:06.751 --> 02:41:08.760
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might work for some people,</v>

2937
02:41:08.761 --> 02:41:12.600
<v Speaker 2>but I feel like this is not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not an answering machine,</v>

2938
02:41:12.630 --> 02:41:13.800
<v Speaker 2>this is a teacher.</v>

2939
02:41:13.800 --> 02:41:18.150
<v Speaker 2>This is something that is intelligent</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you have a dialogue with,</v>

2940
02:41:18.630 --> 02:41:20.190
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you don't,</v>

2941
02:41:20.530 --> 02:41:22.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>teacher teaches a lesson.</v>

2942
02:41:22.831 --> 02:41:24.270
<v Speaker 2>You don't say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks very much.</v>

2943
02:41:24.750 --> 02:41:25.680
<v Speaker 2>We're done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

2944
02:41:25.920 --> 02:41:30.920
<v Speaker 2>It's an ongoing process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been taking psychedelics for most</v>

2945
02:41:30.931 --> 02:41:32.580
<v Speaker 2>of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good part of my life.</v>

2946
02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:36.570
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I've only learned a fraction</v>
<v Speaker 2>of what they have to teach me,</v>

2947
02:41:37.110 --> 02:41:37.943
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2948
02:41:37.950 --> 02:41:41.760
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm just dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I don't get the message as well as</v>

2949
02:41:41.761 --> 02:41:43.500
<v Speaker 2>other people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think so.</v>

2950
02:41:43.501 --> 02:41:47.400
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're full of surprises.</v>

2951
02:41:47.401 --> 02:41:48.980
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've taken Iowaska,</v>

2952
02:41:50.100 --> 02:41:53.160
<v Speaker 2>Lux,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lost track a long time ago,</v>

2953
02:41:53.161 --> 02:41:57.540
<v Speaker 2>but probably 500 times or more and</v>
<v Speaker 2>people say,</v>

2954
02:41:57.541 --> 02:41:58.350
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2955
02:41:58.350 --> 02:42:01.110
<v Speaker 2>surely you've learned everything there</v>
<v Speaker 2>is to learn.</v>

2956
02:42:01.680 --> 02:42:03.360
<v Speaker 2>Actually No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2957
02:42:03.420 --> 02:42:08.420
<v Speaker 2>I always learned something new</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I learned certain basic things to</v>

2958
02:42:09.691 --> 02:42:11.360
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It always reminds me about,</v>

2959
02:42:11.700 --> 02:42:16.700
<v Speaker 1>well also remember that you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>any chief and you're also acquiring new</v>

2960
02:42:18.391 --> 02:42:22.050
<v Speaker 1>data constantly in the natural world</v>
<v Speaker 1>that needs to be processed and sometimes</v>

2961
02:42:22.410 --> 02:42:26.300
<v Speaker 1>you process it with the tools of</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization versus.</v>

2962
02:42:26.420 --> 02:42:28.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Versus the psychedelics.</v>

2963
02:42:29.610 --> 02:42:31.080
<v Speaker 1>It's A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2964
02:42:31.081 --> 02:42:32.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just interesting.</v>

2965

<v Speaker 1>I wish we could do it more often.</v>

2973

<v Speaker 1>We should do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We definitely should.</v>

2977
02:43:04.830 --> 02:43:07.590
<v Speaker 1>but certain people you ought to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking to you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's do it.</v>

02:43:09.300 --> 02:43:12.040
<v Speaker 1>So please one more time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell people about</v>

2980
02:43:12.040 --> 02:43:15.850

<v Speaker 2>when they can watch it on facebook.</v>

2981
02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:18.200
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it's the e,</v>

2982
02:43:18.201 --> 02:43:18.831
<v Speaker 2>s,</v>
<v Speaker 2>p,</v>

2983
02:43:18.831 --> 02:43:20.740
<v Speaker 2>e d [inaudible] dot com.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

2984
02:43:20.770 --> 02:43:22.960
<v Speaker 2>that's the key thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Esp d 50.</v>

2985
02:43:23.320 --> 02:43:28.320
<v Speaker 2>The conference will be June sixth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seventh and the eighth in the UK.</v>

2986
02:43:28.960 --> 02:43:31.330
<v Speaker 2>You can go there if you want to attend</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

2987
02:43:31.390 --> 02:43:35.350
<v Speaker 2>The cost is high to actually go there</v>
<v Speaker 2>and do it,</v>

2988
02:43:35.890 --> 02:43:39.580
<v Speaker 2>but people could access it on facebook</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if you go to that website then</v>

2989
02:43:39.581 --> 02:43:43.720
<v Speaker 2>there's a link through to the facebook</v>
<v Speaker 2>page and we'll be live streaming it,</v>

2990
02:43:43.840 --> 02:43:44.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the sixth,</v>

2991
02:43:45.070 --> 02:43:48.910
<v Speaker 2>the sixth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seventh and eighth of June at.</v>

2992
02:43:48.911 --> 02:43:51.700
<v Speaker 2>It'll be archived.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I don't expect people in the states</v>

2993
02:43:51.701 --> 02:43:53.490
<v Speaker 2>to get up at three in the morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2994
02:43:53.530 --> 02:43:55.150
<v Speaker 2>to watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although they could,</v>

2995
02:43:55.151 --> 02:43:57.310
<v Speaker 2>if they want to watch it live,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it'll all be,</v>

2996
02:43:57.810 --> 02:43:59.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>archives.</v>

2997
02:43:59.561 --> 02:44:03.490
<v Speaker 2>So they can look at it at any time and</v>
<v Speaker 2>will you transfer it over to other more</v>

2998
02:44:03.491 --> 02:44:06.460
<v Speaker 2>accessible that people that don't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>facebook maybe on youtube or something</v>

2999
02:44:06.461 --> 02:44:07.630
<v Speaker 2>along those lines of Vimeo?</v>

3000
02:44:08.560 --> 02:44:11.440
<v Speaker 2>Eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We haven't made plans to live stream it</v>

3001
02:44:11.441 --> 02:44:13.770
<v Speaker 2>on vimeo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how you do that.</v>

3002
02:44:13.780 --> 02:44:16.510
<v Speaker 2>I think you can live stream it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you could definitely take the video</v>

3003
02:44:16.511 --> 02:44:18.760
<v Speaker 2>recording.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps if you have a physical</v>

3004
02:44:18.780 --> 02:44:19.630
<v Speaker 2>recording,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'll.</v>

3005
02:44:19.631 --> 02:44:23.530
<v Speaker 2>It'll all be up there eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just live stream real time.</v>

3006
02:44:23.531 --> 02:44:28.531
<v Speaker 2>Facebook will be where we do it mostly</v>
<v Speaker 2>because everyone has told me this is how</v>

3007
02:44:28.841 --> 02:44:29.674
<v Speaker 2>you do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

3008
02:44:29.790 --> 02:44:33.010
<v Speaker 2>well I will definitely tweet that out to</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody and I'll let everybody know</v>

3009
02:44:33.011 --> 02:44:36.010
<v Speaker 2>and I'll put it on all the available</v>
<v Speaker 2>social media.</v>

<v Speaker 2>book and the book will come out probably</v>

3012
02:44:43.121 --> 02:44:48.040
<v Speaker 2>the end of November and it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 2>take a few months for everybody to get</v>

<v Speaker 2>presentation,</v>

3015
