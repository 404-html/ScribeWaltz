<v Speaker 3>it was such a retard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a t one line installed in my </v>

234
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:14.411
<v Speaker 3>house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to ask you to go to pit bull </v>

235
00:10:14.411 --> 00:10:16.411
<v Speaker 3>websites.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like dogs because I just had to </v>

236
00:10:16.411 --> 00:10:19.871
<v Speaker 3>throw away a lot of my computers and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>was so sad because you would go through </v>

237
00:10:19.871 --> 00:10:23.861
<v Speaker 3>and look at all the video cards and look</v>
<v Speaker 3>how cool they looked back then and </v>

238
00:10:23.861 --> 00:10:23.990
<v Speaker 3>they're just shit now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

239
00:10:23.991 --> 00:10:26.240
<v Speaker 3>your iphone is a million times faster </v>
<v Speaker 3>than that video cards.</v>

240
00:10:26.241 --> 00:10:27.500
<v Speaker 3>So really incredible,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

241
00:10:27.530 --> 00:10:29.990
<v Speaker 3>If you think about like back in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>quake two days,</v>

242
00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:35.020
<v Speaker 3>like quake two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to have what was called a two </v>

243
00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:37.940
<v Speaker 3>video cards in sli formation mean </v>
<v Speaker 3>they're both linked up.</v>

244
00:10:37.941 --> 00:10:42.941
<v Speaker 3>You have to separate video cards and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they linked together through this </v>

245
00:10:42.941 --> 00:10:46.181
<v Speaker 3>computer cable and it doubles your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your bandwidth as far as the ability to </v>

246
00:10:46.181 --> 00:10:46.520
<v Speaker 3>offer that to you.</v>

247
00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:49.730
<v Speaker 3>Dragged me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could he get fucking candles?</v>

248
00:10:49.731 --> 00:10:53.270
<v Speaker 3>Are Guns for the quake thing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like the special kind of animals?</v>

249
00:10:53.271 --> 00:10:53.770
<v Speaker 3>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

250
00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:54.360
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

251
00:10:54.361 --> 00:10:59.361
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You play quake with a mouse and </v>

252
00:10:59.361 --> 00:10:59.361
<v Speaker 3>keyboard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

253
00:10:59.361 --> 00:10:59.361
<v Speaker 3>There was something you were playing </v>
<v Speaker 3>where I had to,</v>

254
00:10:59.361 --> 00:11:00.320
<v Speaker 3>we had to get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a while.</v>

255
00:11:00.321 --> 00:11:01.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

256
00:11:01.011 --> 00:11:06.011
<v Speaker 3>I had a controller called the something </v>
<v Speaker 3>three deed and had a track ball and uh,</v>

257
00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.340
<v Speaker 3>a gun on it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really cool.</v>

258
00:11:09.341 --> 00:11:10.070
<v Speaker 3>I came with them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

259
00:11:10.071 --> 00:11:15.071
<v Speaker 3>I gotta get this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the track balls just not quite as </v>

260
00:11:15.071 --> 00:11:18.101
<v Speaker 3>accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was some guys that were really </v>

261
00:11:18.101 --> 00:11:18.280
<v Speaker 3>good with that controller,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the thing was about that controller,</v>

262
00:11:18.281 --> 00:11:20.570
<v Speaker 3>it was very controversial because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't.</v>

263
00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:23.330
<v Speaker 3>If you learn how to use that control and</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you wouldn't be good at the mouse.</v>

264
00:11:23.331 --> 00:11:28.331
<v Speaker 3>And the keyboard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which was widely accepted by almost </v>

265
00:11:28.331 --> 00:11:28.331
<v Speaker 3>everybody to be the most accurate way.</v>

266
00:11:28.331 --> 00:11:29.570
<v Speaker 3>Some guys get really good at using the </v>
<v Speaker 3>control,</v>

267
00:11:29.571 --> 00:11:34.571
<v Speaker 3>but there were still fucking themselves </v>
<v Speaker 3>by not just going with a mouse and </v>

268
00:11:34.571 --> 00:11:37.241
<v Speaker 3>keyboard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Would you do what you do a live quake </v>

269
00:11:37.241 --> 00:11:37.460
<v Speaker 3>match in front of an audience?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Every says Kevin prayer.</v>

270
00:11:37.830 --> 00:11:38.420
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

271
00:11:38.421 --> 00:11:39.170
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that'd be fun.</v>

272
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:40.880
<v Speaker 3>And comic con 2000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

273
00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:45.910
<v Speaker 3>if I can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it all depends on the phone if I </v>

274
00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:48.401
<v Speaker 3>can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you don't have to train for it and </v>

275
00:11:48.401 --> 00:11:48.401
<v Speaker 3>know that's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem is if I started training,</v>

276
00:11:48.401 --> 00:11:49.790
<v Speaker 3>I would get obsessed again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

277
00:11:49.791 --> 00:11:54.791
<v Speaker 3>But you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you don't know the rush gets crazy </v>

278
00:11:54.791 --> 00:11:54.791
<v Speaker 3>rush of getting really</v>

279
00:11:54.791 --> 00:11:59.070
<v Speaker 4>good at quake is it's so intense because</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're playing in these three d games </v>

280
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:04.810
<v Speaker 4>where you're running down hallways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have a variety of weapons on you and</v>

281
00:12:04.811 --> 00:12:09.811
<v Speaker 4>you're chasing motherfuckers trying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>kill them and when you kill them they </v>

282
00:12:09.811 --> 00:12:10.150
<v Speaker 4>splatter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're shooting rockets at them and it's</v>

283
00:12:10.151 --> 00:12:15.151
<v Speaker 4>all in real time and the graphics are </v>
<v Speaker 4>amazing and you're seeing it through a </v>

284
00:12:15.151 --> 00:12:18.991
<v Speaker 4>first person perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Either you're seeing a gun in front of </v>

285
00:12:18.991 --> 00:12:18.991
<v Speaker 4>you or seemed crosshairs in front of </v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

286
00:12:18.991 --> 00:12:23.281
<v Speaker 4>but you're manipulating the character </v>
<v Speaker 4>and the better you get at your hand eye </v>

287
00:12:23.281 --> 00:12:23.620
<v Speaker 4>coordination and your understanding of </v>
<v Speaker 4>maps,</v>

288
00:12:23.770 --> 00:12:26.050
<v Speaker 4>the more effectively you can just fuck </v>
<v Speaker 4>people up.</v>

289
00:12:26.051 --> 00:12:27.250
<v Speaker 4>Like there's many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many,</v>

290
00:12:27.251 --> 00:12:29.650
<v Speaker 4>many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>many levels and video game skills.</v>

291
00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:33.370
<v Speaker 4>And I never got really good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got good for a regular person.</v>

292
00:12:33.371 --> 00:12:35.020
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I never got like really good.</v>

293
00:12:35.021 --> 00:12:37.560
<v Speaker 4>But I played some really good guys and </v>
<v Speaker 4>just got slow</v>

294
00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:40.100
<v Speaker 2>when I was doing my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

295
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:45.170
<v Speaker 2>when I was doing a hang,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not hang over a ride along that movie I </v>

296
00:12:45.170 --> 00:12:47.820
<v Speaker 2>shot in uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Atlanta with ice cube and Kevin Hart.</v>

297
00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:53.210
<v Speaker 2>I would go into Kevin Hart's a trailer </v>
<v Speaker 2>all the time because it would just hang </v>

298
00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:56.451
<v Speaker 2>out in these hilarious and he'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he and his buddies would be taking that </v>

299
00:12:56.451 --> 00:12:57.770
<v Speaker 2>madden basketball game so far.</v>

303
00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:06.120
<v Speaker 2>games and get pissed off at each other </v>
<v Speaker 2>if they lost.</v>

304
00:13:06.121 --> 00:13:07.330
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they're really a tight group.</v>

305
00:13:07.331 --> 00:13:09.520
<v Speaker 2>They love each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was war.</v>

306
00:13:09.521 --> 00:13:11.530
<v Speaker 2>That fucking game was war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I come in,</v>

307
00:13:11.531 --> 00:13:12.270
<v Speaker 2>Hey Kevin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we plan.</v>

308
00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:15.640
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't even eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're addictive.</v>

309
00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:17.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's super different.</v>

310
00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:18.900
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't fuck around with them anymore.</v>

311
00:13:18.901 --> 00:13:23.901
<v Speaker 4>I still play pool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't fuck around with video games </v>

312
00:13:23.901 --> 00:13:23.910
<v Speaker 4>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I am still addicted to technology,</v>

313
00:13:23.911 --> 00:13:25.920
<v Speaker 4>which is why like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we uh,</v>

314
00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:27.720
<v Speaker 4>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're really into ting with tim.</v>

315
00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:31.830
<v Speaker 4>Tim provides a is not just the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 4>android phones available,</v>

316
00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:37.040
<v Speaker 4>but we also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they also provide contract free cell </v>

317
00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.540
<v Speaker 4>phone service on a major network.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's on the sprint backbone,</v>

318
00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:43.950
<v Speaker 4>so it's not like you're not in a mom and</v>
<v Speaker 4>pop network.</v>

319
00:13:43.951 --> 00:13:45.140
<v Speaker 4>You're on a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

320
00:13:45.190 --> 00:13:50.190
<v Speaker 4>a huge network and you can do that with </v>
<v Speaker 4>no contracts and the way a sprint has </v>

321
00:13:51.571 --> 00:13:52.850
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not only other,</v>

322
00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:57.860
<v Speaker 4>no contracts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they give you credit on unused </v>

323
00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.891
<v Speaker 4>service.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you use less than you would on </v>

324
00:14:00.891 --> 00:14:01.280
<v Speaker 4>Tang sprint.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sprint,</v>

325
00:14:01.281 --> 00:14:02.630
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well they're using sprint.</v>

326
00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:05.040
<v Speaker 4>Sprint doesn't have the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

327
00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:06.150
<v Speaker 4>Well don't go to sprint.</v>

328
00:14:06.390 --> 00:14:10.950
<v Speaker 4>Take Jesus Christ who lets us get high </v>
<v Speaker 4>and do commercials.</v>

329
00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:16.280
<v Speaker 4>I want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know whose idea that was </v>

330
00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:16.280
<v Speaker 4>laughing because there's so many </v>
<v Speaker 4>entering and so on.</v>

331
00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:16.380
<v Speaker 4>They're awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

332
00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:18.840
<v Speaker 4>I'm ting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyway,</v>

333
00:14:18.841 --> 00:14:23.841
<v Speaker 4>go to [inaudible] dot ting.com</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you can save yourself 25 bucks off </v>

334
00:14:23.841 --> 00:14:28.341
<v Speaker 4>of either one of their phones or one of </v>
<v Speaker 4>their or their service.</v>

335
00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:33.360
<v Speaker 4>And what I was saying was that 10 gives </v>
<v Speaker 4>you credit on unused service.</v>

336
00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.310
<v Speaker 4>So if you use less than you thought you </v>
<v Speaker 4>would,</v>

337
00:14:35.570 --> 00:14:40.570
<v Speaker 4>ting actually drops you down and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and credits you the difference on your </v>

338
00:14:40.570 --> 00:14:41.240
<v Speaker 4>next bill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

339
00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:45.000
<v Speaker 4>that's unheard of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Companies never give you the money back.</v>

340
00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:50.090
<v Speaker 4>That's the ethical way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And what they realized is you can still </v>

341
00:14:50.090 --> 00:14:51.350
<v Speaker 4>make money and provide people</v>

342
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:55.760
<v Speaker 1>a great service and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to fuck people over.</v>

343
00:14:55.761 --> 00:14:58.700
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to rip them off and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can do things in a generous way.</v>

344
00:14:58.701 --> 00:15:00.260
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how [inaudible] operates.</v>

345
00:15:00.261 --> 00:15:01.710
<v Speaker 1>And I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's,</v>

346
00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.110
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a great ethic.</v>

347
00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:05.960
<v Speaker 1>And when you see a company that has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

348
00:15:05.961 --> 00:15:08.300
<v Speaker 1>that that's how they're operating their </v>

<v Speaker 1>like the ethical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

353
00:15:17.691 --> 00:15:20.990
<v Speaker 1>I just got sponsored to buy ting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Brian callen show,</v>

354
00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:26.960
<v Speaker 1>the bride cat got some good guests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not to mention the 10 minute </v>

355
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:26.960
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>

356
00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:27.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

357
00:15:27.501 --> 00:15:28.390
<v Speaker 1>the Ting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

358
00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.390
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they came to me,</v>

359
00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:30.470
<v Speaker 1>I said to myself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

360
00:15:30.471 --> 00:15:32.000
<v Speaker 1>I knew there were a good company for </v>

<v Speaker 1>that's great.</v>

362
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.350
<v Speaker 1>But then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

363
00:15:35.150 --> 00:15:36.700
<v Speaker 1>if you get a sponsored by,</v>

<v Speaker 1>somebody wants to offer you a lot of </v>

365
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.481
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say you're podcast becomes huge and </v>

366
00:15:43.481 --> 00:15:45.480
<v Speaker 1>somebody and some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes companies can become so big </v>

367
00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:45.480
<v Speaker 1>and you're not sure where their </v>
<v Speaker 1>interests are,</v>

368
00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:50.201
<v Speaker 1>what they're doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really does kind of raise some </v>

369
00:15:50.201 --> 00:15:53.200
<v Speaker 1>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be responsible for </v>

370
00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.271
<v Speaker 1>supporting or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or shelling a company that doesn't have </v>

371
00:15:55.271 --> 00:15:55.271
<v Speaker 1>ethical practices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

372
00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.650
<v Speaker 1>it's a hard one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have to anymore.</v>

373
00:15:57.690 --> 00:16:02.690
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's plenty of really good companies </v>

374
00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:04.721
<v Speaker 1>and I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of these companies also </v>

375
00:16:04.721 --> 00:16:06.440
<v Speaker 1>operating on the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Internet is pretty transparent.</v>

376
00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:11.960
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not difficult to compare rates and </v>

377
00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:12.380
<v Speaker 1>services and that with cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

378
00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:13.310
<v Speaker 1>People.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

379
00:16:13.311 --> 00:16:13.970
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

380
00:16:13.971 --> 00:16:16.570
<v Speaker 1>it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they also know that it's an.</v>

381
00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:20.990
<v Speaker 1>He taught every company has enough to </v>
<v Speaker 1>squeeze every last blood out of.</v>

382
00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:26.380
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have something that it's </v>

383
00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:26.380
<v Speaker 1>required,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a service like cell phone service,</v>

384
00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:29.090
<v Speaker 1>it becomes that weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creepy thing where they've got you.</v>

385
00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.010
<v Speaker 1>You fucking need them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

386
00:16:31.011 --> 00:16:32.300
<v Speaker 1>You know you need that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's right.</v>

387
00:16:32.301 --> 00:16:32.860
<v Speaker 1>You need the mic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me.</v>

388
00:16:32.861 --> 00:16:37.861
<v Speaker 1>Mcdonald's says that they have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never turned anybody but like a </v>

389
00:16:37.861 --> 00:16:37.861
<v Speaker 1>hamburger meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you go in and say,</v>

390
00:16:37.861 --> 00:16:39.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't like my hamburger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That give you a free one.</v>

391
00:16:39.141 --> 00:16:40.730
<v Speaker 1>Why the hamburger?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people say,</v>

392
00:16:40.731 --> 00:16:45.731
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you walk in and you're not a $2 </v>

393
00:16:45.731 --> 00:16:47.471
<v Speaker 1>hamburger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The average customer in Mcdonald's </v>

394
00:16:47.471 --> 00:16:49.640
<v Speaker 1>spends I think about $53,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>over a lifetime on Mcdonald's.</v>

395
00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:51.950
<v Speaker 1>They're loyal customers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you walked through that door,</v>

396
00:16:51.951 --> 00:16:53.860
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're worth $53,000.</v>

397
00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:56.690
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting way of living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they treat you like a person,</v>

398
00:16:56.691 --> 00:17:01.691
<v Speaker 1>not a hamburger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't treat you do it because they </v>

399
00:17:01.691 --> 00:17:01.691
<v Speaker 1>want to be nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

400
00:17:01.691 --> 00:17:02.240
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Mcdonald's,</v>

401
00:17:02.241 --> 00:17:04.490
<v Speaker 1>you fucking county number count and </v>
<v Speaker 1>assholes.</v>

402
00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:09.910
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many you just do it because you </v>

403
00:17:09.910 --> 00:17:12.130
<v Speaker 1>don't treat someone like they're $50,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>that some companies like starbucks from </v>

404
00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:14.210
<v Speaker 1>what I understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is very responsible socially.</v>

405
00:17:14.211 --> 00:17:19.211
<v Speaker 1>Like they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very intent on using the money </v>

406
00:17:19.211 --> 00:17:19.211
<v Speaker 1>to make our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

408
00:17:19.211 --> 00:17:23.861

<v Speaker 1>It's a big responsibility and I think </v>

409
00:17:23.861 --> 00:17:26.411
<v Speaker 1>that you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just how about doing it because </v>

410
00:17:26.411 --> 00:17:26.411
<v Speaker 1>it's the right thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't need a lot of sleep out here </v>

459
00:19:33.670 --> 00:19:37.240
<v Speaker 1>The amount of stimulus we're exposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're inundated.</v>

<v Speaker 1>experienced when you go camping.</v>

463
00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.380
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're designed for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're designed to take in nature.</v>

464
00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:52.620
<v Speaker 1>We're not designed for Times Square.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The human body does not know what the </v>

465
00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:52.620
<v Speaker 1>fuck to do with Times Square.</v>

466
00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:54.610
<v Speaker 1>The human body sees giant billboards and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just goes,</v>

467
00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:59.110
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your whole system is out of whack.</v>

468
00:19:59.111 --> 00:20:00.010
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh fuck,</v>

469
00:20:00.011 --> 00:20:01.950
<v Speaker 1>am I even looking at what about you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

470
00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.580
<v Speaker 1>what am I looking at when I'm going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the movies?</v>

471
00:20:03.581 --> 00:20:05.810
<v Speaker 1>What am I looking at when I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I dealing with?</v>

472
00:20:05.811 --> 00:20:09.490
<v Speaker 1>And I'm listening to songs that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the input that we received today,</v>

473
00:20:09.491 --> 00:20:11.170
<v Speaker 1>so we're not designed for any of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

474
00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:15.880
<v Speaker 1>Our bodies not caught up to what </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology can do you fucks.</v>

475
00:20:16.450 --> 00:20:18.790
<v Speaker 1>That's why they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's one theory about autism kids,</v>

476
00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:23.380
<v Speaker 1>kids who have hyperactive minds and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>

477
00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:26.710
<v Speaker 1>central nervous systems that maybe we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolving.</v>

478
00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:30.880
<v Speaker 1>We're literally evolving with technology</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I totally believe that.</v>

479
00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.180
<v Speaker 1>I totally believe that it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

480
00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:36.910
<v Speaker 1>I think it's terrifying for people </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we love our emotions,</v>

481
00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:42.360
<v Speaker 1>but I think the reality is we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably going to eventually outgrow </v>

482
00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:42.360
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

483
00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:45.010
<v Speaker 3>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did I say that I was having fun alive.</v>

<v Speaker 3>today at a circus of thing where they </v>

594
00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:05.891
<v Speaker 3>had a chimp that they muscled and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>took strong men and tried to control </v>

764
00:34:39.051 --> 00:34:40.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think what happens though,</v>

765
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:42.260
<v Speaker 1>when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you've hit the apex of fame,</v>

766
00:34:42.261 --> 00:34:43.940
<v Speaker 1>like when you're a rock star on his </v>
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>

767
00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:47.630
<v Speaker 1>you're the biggest that you don't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>more famous than that.</v>

768
00:34:47.631 --> 00:34:49.870
<v Speaker 1>You just don't on earth on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on earth man.</v>

769
00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:50.770
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

770
00:34:50.771 --> 00:34:53.120
<v Speaker 1>and just to play the stadiums and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>they go crazy.</v>

771
00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:56.840
<v Speaker 1>And I think once you do that and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of,</v>

772
00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:59.810
<v Speaker 1>if you're an interested person in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

773
00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.450
<v Speaker 1>you realize that it's like you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>immune to that.</v>

774
00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:03.890
<v Speaker 1>You actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you'd get immune to it.</v>

775
00:35:03.891 --> 00:35:08.891
<v Speaker 1>I think you'd get immune to that public </v>
<v Speaker 1>and brace and then you've got to find </v>

776
00:35:08.891 --> 00:35:12.131
<v Speaker 1>some way else to keep yourself inspired </v>

811
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:40.800
<v Speaker 1>like just off the top of his head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an animal.</v>

812
00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:44.820
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's so fucking legit fucking dumb.</v>

813
00:36:45.390 --> 00:36:50.390
<v Speaker 1>Stand up for 100 years and a high level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always love to remind dom that I paid </v>

814
00:36:51.481 --> 00:36:54.150
<v Speaker 1>to see him before I ever did comedy </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

815
00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:55.300
<v Speaker 1>Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

816
00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:56.740
<v Speaker 1>I remember his jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did his job.</v>

817
00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:00.210
<v Speaker 1>Got I paid to see him in Nick's comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop.</v>

818
00:37:00.211 --> 00:37:05.211
<v Speaker 1>I actually went two nights in a row </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he missed his flight or </v>

819
00:37:05.211 --> 00:37:08.811
<v Speaker 1>something like that on the first night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so that was how I found out about </v>

820
00:37:08.811 --> 00:37:12.501
<v Speaker 1>Denis leary had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dennis leary went up that night and I </v>

821
00:37:12.501 --> 00:37:12.501
<v Speaker 1>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is this guy?</v>

822
00:37:12.501 --> 00:37:15.360
<v Speaker 1>Where the fuck is dominant?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I painted seat down my rarer.</v>

823
00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:16.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something happened.</v>

824
00:37:16.471 --> 00:37:18.570
<v Speaker 1>There was like a missed flight or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something along those lines.</v>

825
00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:20.400
<v Speaker 1>So I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

826
00:37:20.401 --> 00:37:23.040
<v Speaker 1>this guy who's this guy was like so </v>
<v Speaker 1>bummed out,</v>

827
00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:26.070
<v Speaker 1>but he fucking destroyed.</v>

828
00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:29.530
<v Speaker 1>He destroyed no care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>care for cancer.</v>

829
00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:34.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is before I knew anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the plagiarism or anything about </v>

830
00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:38.421
<v Speaker 1>the bad things you hear about leary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All I knew then I didn't even know who </v>

831
00:37:38.421 --> 00:37:40.540
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he went on and fucking amazing.</v>

832
00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.870
<v Speaker 1>He was like my favorite comedian for </v>
<v Speaker 1>like six months.</v>

833
00:37:42.871 --> 00:37:44.640
<v Speaker 1>Incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you see somebody who's that good at</v>

834
00:37:44.641 --> 00:37:49.641
<v Speaker 1>something you don't stand up for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first time and you have like maybe </v>

835
00:37:49.641 --> 00:37:53.270
<v Speaker 1>designs on what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I just did this interview just now </v>

836
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:55.020
<v Speaker 1>today for the San Antonio thing and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>literally said to the guy,</v>

837
00:37:55.021 --> 00:37:57.720
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still can't believe I can do standup.</v>

838
00:37:57.721 --> 00:38:02.721
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I'm lucky enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I truly lucky enough to go around the </v>

839
00:38:02.721 --> 00:38:06.090
<v Speaker 1>country and make people laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't believe I have that capacity.</v>

840
00:38:06.091 --> 00:38:11.091
<v Speaker 1>Like the great surprise of my life was </v>
<v Speaker 1>waking up one day and realizing I think </v>

841
00:38:11.091 --> 00:38:13.230
<v Speaker 1>maybe I can do this if I really </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice.</v>

842
00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:14.370
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

843
00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:16.410
<v Speaker 1>when did you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when did you come to that?</v>

844
00:38:16.710 --> 00:38:18.570
<v Speaker 1>I will always thought you always knew </v>
<v Speaker 1>you could do.</v>

845
00:38:18.571 --> 00:38:19.650
<v Speaker 1>No Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

846
00:38:19.651 --> 00:38:21.810
<v Speaker 1>I was a silly goose always as you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

847
00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:25.770
<v Speaker 1>I remember I a Patty Jenkins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my old,</v>

848
00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:27.600
<v Speaker 1>my old girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the director said,</v>

849
00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:29.280
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

850
00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:32.310
<v Speaker 1>I made a speech or something at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>wedding or something and I was funny and</v>

851
00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:34.110
<v Speaker 1>she said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got three words for you dude.</v>

852
00:38:34.111 --> 00:38:36.100
<v Speaker 1>Stand up comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not</v>

853
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:37.920
<v Speaker 3>going to walk into a room as this guy or</v>
<v Speaker 3>that like,</v>

854
00:38:37.930 --> 00:38:39.400
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy's really unique.</v>

855
00:38:39.401 --> 00:38:44.401
<v Speaker 3>He's five foot 11,</v>
<v Speaker 3>165 pounds with Brown eyes and Brown </v>

856
00:38:44.401 --> 00:38:44.401
<v Speaker 3>hair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

857
00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:49.420
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to go in there looking </v>

858
00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:49.420
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're funny.</v>

859
00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:50.710
<v Speaker 3>And she got me to start doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

860
00:38:50.711 --> 00:38:53.110
<v Speaker 3>I can't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I went home and wrote a monologue on</v>

861
00:38:53.111 --> 00:38:54.940
<v Speaker 3>what it's like to be reborn.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A penguin,</v>

862
00:38:54.970 --> 00:38:57.490
<v Speaker 3>a legless flightless bird in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the South Pole.</v>

863
00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:59.170
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of a funny idea.</v>

864
00:38:59.171 --> 00:39:00.340
<v Speaker 3>Concept.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

865
00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:05.610
<v Speaker 3>And I wrote it and I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I came up to my friends at night and I </v>

866
00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:05.610
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

867
00:39:05.610 --> 00:39:07.870
<v Speaker 3>I heard this comic doing these jokes and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I pretended it was somebody else.</v>

868
00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:11.530
<v Speaker 3>And they laughed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's slowly how I built a set.</v>

869
00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:13.690
<v Speaker 3>That's a good way of doing it.</v>

870
00:39:13.690 --> 00:39:16.210
<v Speaker 3>And that's so like your personality to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do that.</v>

871
00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:19.000
<v Speaker 3>You're not really a self congratulatory </v>
<v Speaker 3>God.</v>

872
00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:20.280
<v Speaker 3>Terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

873
00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:21.610
<v Speaker 3>that's what you would do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would,</v>

874
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:25.330
<v Speaker 3>you would congratulate someone else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make a pre pretend character.</v>

875
00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:26.830
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friend is so funny.</v>

876
00:39:26.831 --> 00:39:28.030
<v Speaker 3>He says,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's so funny.</v>

877
00:39:28.031 --> 00:39:30.100
<v Speaker 3>I do have so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

878
00:39:30.101 --> 00:39:34.300
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm onto something very clever </v>
<v Speaker 3>way to begin standing up,</v>

879
00:39:34.301 --> 00:39:38.470
<v Speaker 3>kind of like to practice on people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would do that with some of the,</v>

880
00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:40.510
<v Speaker 3>this common cat guy with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what he looks like.</v>

881
00:39:40.511 --> 00:39:43.270
<v Speaker 3>He had red hair and I do the joke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was all before I met you.</v>

882
00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:44.070
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

883
00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:46.540
<v Speaker 3>When I met you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were doing comedy a little bit.</v>

884
00:39:46.570 --> 00:39:48.940
<v Speaker 3>You were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you had gotten into the door.</v>

885
00:39:48.970 --> 00:39:51.400
<v Speaker 3>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I don't blame anybody for this,</v>

886
00:39:51.401 --> 00:39:53.170
<v Speaker 3>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

887
00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:58.230
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an attitude that exists or at least it </v>

888
00:39:58.230 --> 00:40:01.291
<v Speaker 3>used to when you got a series or got </v>
<v Speaker 3>some sort of a sitcom stopped when you </v>

889
00:40:01.291 --> 00:40:01.900
<v Speaker 3>could stop doing your stand up.</v>

890
00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:05.530
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I actually had a good friend and a guy I</v>

891
00:40:05.531 --> 00:40:07.810
<v Speaker 3>respect very much said to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

892
00:40:07.811 --> 00:40:09.400
<v Speaker 3>who's a producer?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

893
00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:11.560
<v Speaker 3>are you talking about like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you,</v>

894
00:40:11.760 --> 00:40:16.760
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just doing this for money like </v>

895
00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:19.410
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stand up is the greatest thing in the </v>

896
00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:19.410
<v Speaker 3>world for you to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't know because you've never done</v>

897
00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:19.410
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

898
00:40:19.410 --> 00:40:21.460
<v Speaker 3>and even if you do it and you suck at </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

899
00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:24.790
<v Speaker 3>if there's a possibility that you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>get good enough to be good at it,</v>

900
00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:29.590
<v Speaker 3>stick with that shit so much fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's way better than the activity.</v>

901
00:40:29.591 --> 00:40:31.540
<v Speaker 3>Also a constant challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you're a Rockstar,</v>

902
00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:34.390
<v Speaker 3>you can sing the same song for 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The stones can still sing.</v>

903
00:40:34.391 --> 00:40:35.590
<v Speaker 3>Start me up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And everybody cheers.</v>

904
00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:37.870
<v Speaker 3>You fucking stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to reinvent yourself.</v>

905
00:40:37.871 --> 00:40:38.930
<v Speaker 3>When they come to see you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

906
00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:40.450
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to see a new bag of tricks,</v>

907
00:40:40.451 --> 00:40:40.690
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>

908

<v Speaker 3>your greatest hits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

910
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:46.960
<v Speaker 3>I put on my special whenever it was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>couple months ago.</v>

911
00:40:46.961 --> 00:40:49.140
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not doing a single bit from that.</v>

912
00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:50.290
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all done.</v>

913
00:40:50.291 --> 00:40:53.590
<v Speaker 3>That shit's dead and burdens what I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All my stuff is no fun to do though,</v>

914
00:40:53.591 --> 00:40:54.660
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because uh,</v>

915
00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:55.410
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

916
00:40:55.420 --> 00:41:00.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been inspired by quite a few guys </v>

917
00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:01.960
<v Speaker 3>that do that on a regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bill Burr does on a regular basis.</v>

918
00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:07.140
<v Speaker 3>Louis CK does on a regular basis and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>think he got a lot of people thinking </v>

919
00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:10.951
<v Speaker 3>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like just throw me thinking and come up </v>

920
00:41:10.951 --> 00:41:12.340
<v Speaker 3>with the Nh totally right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because what you really want to see is a</v>

921
00:41:12.341 --> 00:41:14.920
<v Speaker 3>lot of different material from </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedians.</v>

922
00:41:14.950 --> 00:41:17.990
<v Speaker 3>It's also keeps you in a really active </v>
<v Speaker 3>stays in line.</v>

923
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.800
<v Speaker 3>Like I've really learned how to write </v>
<v Speaker 3>anywhere no matter what.</v>

924
00:41:20.801 --> 00:41:25.801
<v Speaker 3>And I'm always thinking of new stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So we decided like how hard we can push </v>

925
00:41:25.801 --> 00:41:25.801
<v Speaker 3>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

926
00:41:25.801 --> 00:41:26.530
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew our a year.</v>

927
00:41:26.531 --> 00:41:27.490
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

928
00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:32.760
<v Speaker 3>you probably could.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You probably could just fucking go to </v>

929
00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.040
<v Speaker 3>work and then when you do do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like when are coming up with new</v>

930
00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:34.790
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so.</v>

931
00:41:34.791 --> 00:41:39.791
<v Speaker 1>It's so exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the shows have a different </v>

932
00:41:39.791 --> 00:41:40.940
<v Speaker 1>energy to them because you're still </v>
<v Speaker 1>laughing at the shit too.</v>

933
00:41:40.941 --> 00:41:45.020
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's still hitting you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know how you are when you're</v>

934
00:41:45.021 --> 00:41:47.510
<v Speaker 1>creating material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I'm creating a material,</v>

935
00:41:47.511 --> 00:41:49.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know where the fuck it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming from.</v>

936
00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:51.760
<v Speaker 1>I never feel like it's mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never do it.</v>

937
00:41:51.790 --> 00:41:56.790
<v Speaker 1>It's a beautiful notion that you're a </v>
<v Speaker 1>channel for something that already </v>

938
00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:56.790
<v Speaker 1>exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

939
00:41:56.790 --> 00:42:00.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's because the only way to </v>

940
00:42:00.510 --> 00:42:02.261
<v Speaker 1>truly use your creativity correctly is </v>
<v Speaker 1>to take your sense of you out of the </v>

941
00:42:02.261 --> 00:42:07.151
<v Speaker 1>equation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not really that you're tapping </v>

942
00:42:07.151 --> 00:42:09.620
<v Speaker 1>into a muse per se,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as to take you out of the equation,</v>

943
00:42:09.621 --> 00:42:13.460
<v Speaker 1>allows all the creativity to sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>appear and unfold.</v>

944
00:42:13.730 --> 00:42:15.620
<v Speaker 1>It's you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This idea of you.</v>

945
00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:20.650
<v Speaker 1>Ego is such an overwhelmingly </v>
<v Speaker 1>constricting mindset.</v>

946
00:42:21.450 --> 00:42:22.310
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then let me,</v>

947
00:42:22.311 --> 00:42:27.311
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me piggyback on that before you go </v>

948
00:42:27.311 --> 00:42:27.311
<v Speaker 1>on to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love this.</v>

949
00:42:27.311 --> 00:42:27.311
<v Speaker 1>I love what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

950
00:42:27.311 --> 00:42:28.610
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when you say ego,</v>

951
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:33.290
<v Speaker 1>a lot of that for you young people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me get specific and I think a lot of</v>

952
00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:36.320
<v Speaker 1>is we all define ourselves on very </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong lines.</v>

953
00:42:36.321 --> 00:42:41.321
<v Speaker 1>Men especially in this society are told </v>
<v Speaker 1>to define yourself along strong lines.</v>

954
00:42:41.391 --> 00:42:41.860
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

955
00:42:41.861 --> 00:42:43.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a tough guy.</v>

956
00:42:43.161 --> 00:42:48.161
<v Speaker 1>You can't push me whatever it might be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a musician that comes with a lot of </v>

957
00:42:48.161 --> 00:42:51.020
<v Speaker 1>baggage and I think that that one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice things about trying to learning how</v>

958
00:42:51.021 --> 00:42:52.930
<v Speaker 1>to create is to loosen those lines a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little.</v>

959
00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:54.440
<v Speaker 1>Don't try to define yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have.</v>

960
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:55.820
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to be right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>

961
00:42:55.821 --> 00:42:59.060
<v Speaker 1>don't pigeon hole yourself into a tough </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy or I'm this guy,</v>

962
00:42:59.061 --> 00:42:59.300
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

963
00:42:59.450 --> 00:43:00.890
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not when you're creating.</v>

964
00:43:01.210 --> 00:43:04.190
<v Speaker 1>And it goes back to what you said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take yourself out of the equation.</v>

965
00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:09.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people try to define themselves because </v>

966
00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:09.310
<v Speaker 1>they're insecure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

967
00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:10.130
<v Speaker 1>That's how when I was a young man and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was insecure,</v>

968
00:43:10.131 --> 00:43:12.680
<v Speaker 1>this one I tried to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to define myself.</v>

969
00:43:12.681 --> 00:43:14.750
<v Speaker 1>I would try to pretend to be somebody I </v>
<v Speaker 1>would try to,</v>

970
00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:17.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as I wanted to be an individual,</v>

971
00:43:17.991 --> 00:43:21.200
<v Speaker 1>complete individual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I certainly wasn't good at it,</v>

972
00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:22.360
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

973
00:43:22.361 --> 00:43:27.361
<v Speaker 1>at the end it's also like I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just played volleyball with Brendan </v>

974
00:43:27.361 --> 00:43:27.361
<v Speaker 1>Schaub,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mayhem,</v>

975
00:43:27.361 --> 00:43:30.470
<v Speaker 1>Miller and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my buddy Kiran all fighters and,</v>

976
00:43:30.471 --> 00:43:31.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>

977
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:33.320
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sitting there looking at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>

978
00:43:33.350 --> 00:43:33.820
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

979
00:43:34.250 --> 00:43:36.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jason's been fighting for 15 years,</v>

980
00:43:36.411 --> 00:43:39.290
<v Speaker 1>retired now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he's still a fucking rough athletic,</v>

981
00:43:39.291 --> 00:43:41.100
<v Speaker 1>big guide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at fucking shop.</v>

982
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:44.540
<v Speaker 1>Should have a statue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should have a statue built to him that</v>

983
00:43:44.541 --> 00:43:45.320
<v Speaker 1>I can just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

984
00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:46.020
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

985
00:43:46.021 --> 00:43:51.021
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at what the fuck are you </v>

986
00:43:51.021 --> 00:43:51.021
<v Speaker 1>talking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm gay.</v>

987
00:43:51.021 --> 00:43:51.021
<v Speaker 1>I'm gay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm straight.</v>

988
00:43:51.021 --> 00:43:51.530
<v Speaker 1>I just want to talk about Brendan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get very good.</v>

989
00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:56.930
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm looking at how big and strong </v>

990
00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:56.930
<v Speaker 1>these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I thought to myself,</v>

991
00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:59.890
<v Speaker 1>there's always somebody stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's always somebody stronger than </v>

992
00:43:59.890 --> 00:43:59.890
<v Speaker 1>those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

993
00:43:59.890 --> 00:43:59.890
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

994
00:43:59.890 --> 00:44:01.460
<v Speaker 1>that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's going to be one strongest guy.</v>

995
00:44:01.520 --> 00:44:03.180
<v Speaker 1>It's gotta be it's gotta be this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

996
00:44:03.230 --> 00:44:08.230
<v Speaker 1>It's not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always gonna be someone brings </v>

997
00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:08.230
<v Speaker 1>me to my point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the idea that,</v>

998
00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:08.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>

999
00:44:08.900 --> 00:44:13.900
<v Speaker 1>there's not a real difference in some </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways between me and sharp or somebody </v>

1000
00:44:14.571 --> 00:44:16.910
<v Speaker 1>who's really big in the sense that yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're stronger,</v>

1001
00:44:16.911 --> 00:44:18.920
<v Speaker 1>but we're all compared to somebody else.</v>

1002
00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:23.920
<v Speaker 1>We're all kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on what context you're </v>

1003
00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:25.430
<v Speaker 1>standing in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm stronger than this guy over here.</v>

1004
00:44:25.431 --> 00:44:27.710
<v Speaker 1>He's stronger than me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really think about this shit.</v>

1005
00:44:27.850 --> 00:44:28.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

1006
00:44:28.730 --> 00:44:30.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was just thinking about how we,</v>

1007
00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:31.140
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we kind of,</v>

1008
00:44:31.330 --> 00:44:36.330
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about how we try to kind </v>

1009
00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:36.330
<v Speaker 1>of aim for certain things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're 45,</v>

1010
00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:41.750
<v Speaker 1>seven as an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just using an example of anything </v>

1011
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:44.841
<v Speaker 1>you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're a musician you want to </v>

1012
00:44:44.841 --> 00:44:44.841
<v Speaker 1>play like that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying that it,</v>

1013
00:44:44.841 --> 00:44:46.740
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only thing that matters is that as a</v>

1014
00:44:46.741 --> 00:44:51.741
<v Speaker 1>false,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a false way of going about </v>

1015
00:44:51.741 --> 00:44:53.991
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you can do is control your own </v>

1016
00:44:53.991 --> 00:44:53.991
<v Speaker 1>expression and who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all you can do is go.</v>

1017
00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:57.780
<v Speaker 1>There is no the idea of a comparing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>something bigger or something that is an</v>

1018
00:44:57.781 --> 00:45:02.781
<v Speaker 1>illusion almost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the only thing you can do is get </v>

1019
00:45:02.781 --> 00:45:02.781
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1020
00:45:02.781 --> 00:45:06.110
<v Speaker 1>Try to not dilute who you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want to keep it as.</v>

1021
00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:08.790
<v Speaker 1>Because it's so hard to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saying that and doing that.</v>

1022
00:45:08.791 --> 00:45:09.870
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is he saying?</v>

1023
00:45:09.930 --> 00:45:11.710
<v Speaker 1>So what does he mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1024
00:45:11.790 --> 00:45:16.790
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to know that your ego will fuck </v>

1025
00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:20.481
<v Speaker 1>you up your ego even though you feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's part of you and you feel like </v>

1026
00:45:20.481 --> 00:45:24.801
<v Speaker 1>it's good to have it protect you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're bullshit yourself about </v>

1027
00:45:24.801 --> 00:45:28.431
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's super important to know when you </v>

1028
00:45:28.431 --> 00:45:29.970
<v Speaker 1>fuck up and not be in denial because </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're in denial,</v>

1029
00:45:29.971 --> 00:45:32.790
<v Speaker 1>it sets you back because no one's </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>

1030
00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:34.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm not perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not perfect.</v>

1031
00:45:34.181 --> 00:45:35.790
<v Speaker 1>There's not a single perfect human </v>
<v Speaker 1>being.</v>

1032
00:45:35.791 --> 00:45:38.880
<v Speaker 1>The idea is ridiculous because it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>

1033
00:45:38.910 --> 00:45:41.100
<v Speaker 1>You're a different person depending on </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I catch you,</v>

1034
00:45:41.130 --> 00:45:46.130
<v Speaker 1>you're a different person depending on </v>
<v Speaker 1>what time of the day and you know and </v>

1035
00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:46.130
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1036
00:45:46.130 --> 00:45:47.910
<v Speaker 1>what happened to you recently or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1037
00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:50.550
<v Speaker 1>what bad thing has gone down in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1038
00:45:50.550 --> 00:45:53.640
<v Speaker 1>You're a different person in every </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute of every day,</v>

1039
00:45:53.730 --> 00:45:56.120
<v Speaker 1>300,</v>
<v Speaker 1>65 days in a way like,</v>

1040
00:45:56.130 --> 00:45:56.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to,</v>

1041
00:45:56.851 --> 00:45:58.590
<v Speaker 1>trying to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is who I am.</v>

1042
00:45:58.591 --> 00:46:02.190
<v Speaker 1>I'm a tough guy or on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to just learn from mistakes.</v>

1043
00:46:02.220 --> 00:46:05.340
<v Speaker 1>Always of course have the ethic of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1044
00:46:05.341 --> 00:46:07.290
<v Speaker 1>just trying to be a good person who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to be nice.</v>

1045
00:46:07.291 --> 00:46:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Try not to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1046
00:46:07.951 --> 00:46:08.880
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well let me ask you this.</v>

1047
00:46:08.910 --> 00:46:13.910
<v Speaker 1>Like you were saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was thinking about this the other </v>

1048
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:13.910
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1049
00:46:13.910 --> 00:46:16.560
<v Speaker 1>nobody's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can try to strive for perfection.</v>

1050
00:46:16.561 --> 00:46:18.150
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't ever reach it,</v>

1051
00:46:18.151 --> 00:46:20.580
<v Speaker 1>but the idea is you can imagine what </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfection isn't a way.</v>

1052
00:46:20.610 --> 00:46:22.320
<v Speaker 1>Like you ever feel that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever feel like,</v>

1053
00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:27.680
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you're doing this thing which is </v>

1054
00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:29.400
<v Speaker 1>stand up and you keep putting out stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>in your mind's eye.</v>

1055
00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:32.340
<v Speaker 1>You have a notion of what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the perfect.</v>

1056
00:46:32.530 --> 00:46:34.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's all waste.</v>

1057
00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:38.280
<v Speaker 1>This is what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I want or what I would try to do.</v>

1058
00:46:38.410 --> 00:46:41.890
<v Speaker 1>I just try to keep writing funny shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just bright it,</v>

1059
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:45.720
<v Speaker 1>make it funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put it together as well as I know,</v>

1060
00:46:46.290 --> 00:46:48.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I explained this to Ra once,</v>

1061
00:46:48.001 --> 00:46:49.430
<v Speaker 1>but it's applicable to me to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1062
00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Ari and I were talking about comedy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>like what's going on now that he has </v>

1063
00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:55.890
<v Speaker 1>like real fans and this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1064
00:46:55.891 --> 00:46:58.650
<v Speaker 1>this new obligation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I said,</v>

1065
00:46:58.651 --> 00:47:00.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I go,</v>

1066
00:47:00.091 --> 00:47:01.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm an Ra,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shift your fan.</v>

1067
00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:03.390

<v Speaker 1>I think you're really hilarious.</v>

1068
00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:04.850
<v Speaker 1>So if I was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1069
00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:07.950
<v Speaker 1>take me out of the context of being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional stand up comedian.</v>

1070
00:47:07.951 --> 00:47:12.951
<v Speaker 1>If I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I was a guy just to doing something </v>

1071
00:47:12.951 --> 00:47:15.201
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're laughing and I found out about </v>

1072
00:47:15.201 --> 00:47:15.201
<v Speaker 1>Ari,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

1073
00:47:15.201 --> 00:47:15.330
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy is funny.</v>

1074
00:47:15.331 --> 00:47:19.080
<v Speaker 1>I would want to buy his CD.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would want to buy his DVD.</v>

1075
00:47:19.081 --> 00:47:21.120
<v Speaker 1>I would become an arch for your fan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

1076
00:47:21.121 --> 00:47:25.800
<v Speaker 1>but once that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're the only guy who can give me Ari.</v>

1077
00:47:25.810 --> 00:47:28.980
<v Speaker 1>Fear you're the only guy who can produce</v>
<v Speaker 1>that material,</v>

1078
00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:30.280
<v Speaker 1>like you have this weird</v>

1079
00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:33.700
<v Speaker 4>obligation and if you do something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

1080
00:47:33.730 --> 00:47:38.730
<v Speaker 4>comics that were like really big at one </v>
<v Speaker 4>point in time and they sort of stopped </v>

1081
00:47:38.730 --> 00:47:40.720
<v Speaker 4>delivering comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they stopped making,</v>

1082
00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:45.900
<v Speaker 4>making new specials and people sort of </v>
<v Speaker 4>gave up on them because they don't </v>

1083
00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:50.521
<v Speaker 4>really talk about them that much anymore</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they're not getting material </v>

1084
00:47:50.521 --> 00:47:50.521
<v Speaker 4>from them on a regular basis.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1085
00:47:50.521 --> 00:47:55.321
<v Speaker 4>So you're the only Brian callen you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>the only guy you're trying to reach </v>

1086
00:47:55.321 --> 00:47:59.110
<v Speaker 4>Brian Cowen fans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I just try to.</v>

1087
00:47:59.830 --> 00:48:03.070
<v Speaker 4>I know that people think that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous shit that I do is funding and</v>

1088
00:48:03.071 --> 00:48:05.950
<v Speaker 4>I know how to do the ridiculous should I</v>
<v Speaker 4>do so just keep doing it.</v>

1089
00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:07.360
<v Speaker 4>That's my thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1090
00:48:07.361 --> 00:48:10.360
<v Speaker 4>The idea that the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess the idea of perfection is really</v>

1091
00:48:10.361 --> 00:48:13.560
<v Speaker 4>a static notion and you're never static </v>
<v Speaker 4>as a verb.</v>

1092
00:48:13.600 --> 00:48:14.370
<v Speaker 4>I always,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1093
00:48:14.530 --> 00:48:18.490
<v Speaker 4>always trying to update the bits.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a little bit different.</v>

1094
00:48:18.490 --> 00:48:21.310
<v Speaker 4>Every show there's always something new </v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm adding,</v>

1095
00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:23.950
<v Speaker 4>I'm taking away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I approaching it a different way.</v>

1096
00:48:23.951 --> 00:48:25.120
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm fucking with it.</v>

1097
00:48:25.121 --> 00:48:30.121
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to find out how to do it the </v>
<v Speaker 4>right way and I'll learn along the way </v>

1098
00:48:30.121 --> 00:48:34.201
<v Speaker 4>through trial and error and from my own </v>
<v Speaker 4>feelings of being too verbose or too </v>

1099
00:48:34.201 --> 00:48:37.540
<v Speaker 4>clunky or whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so in that way,</v>

1100
00:48:37.541 --> 00:48:42.541
<v Speaker 4>and doing it like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you're never in the equation </v>

1101
00:48:42.541 --> 00:48:43.630
<v Speaker 4>equation the equation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The equation is always the impact of the</v>

1102
00:48:43.631 --> 00:48:44.200
<v Speaker 4>material,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>

1103
00:48:44.201 --> 00:48:49.201
<v Speaker 4>how,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is the best way I can do to make </v>

1104
00:48:49.201 --> 00:48:49.201
<v Speaker 4>this funny,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1105
00:48:49.201 --> 00:48:49.201
<v Speaker 4>what is if I was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1106
00:48:49.201 --> 00:48:51.010
<v Speaker 4>if I'm experiencing this myself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1107
00:48:51.011 --> 00:48:55.330
<v Speaker 4>what is the best way to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you sort of become a passenger,</v>

1108
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:57.550
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like you're the one who has to sort</v>

1109
00:48:57.551 --> 00:48:58.870
<v Speaker 4>of orchestrate it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>

1110
00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:01.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the concept of the Muse,</v>

1111
00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:01.990
<v Speaker 4>I hate when I say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1112
00:49:01.991 --> 00:49:04.230
<v Speaker 4>that many times the concept of the muse </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1113
00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:05.260
<v Speaker 4>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1114
00:49:05.261 --> 00:49:06.880
<v Speaker 4>fakers um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1115
00:49:06.910 --> 00:49:08.080
<v Speaker 4>I really should be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1116
00:49:08.090 --> 00:49:08.700
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm,</v>

1117
00:49:08.701 --> 00:49:09.320
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1118
00:49:09.370 --> 00:49:10.690
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't know anything.</v>

1119
00:49:10.690 --> 00:49:12.370
<v Speaker 4>You didn't know what the fuck are you </v>
<v Speaker 4>even talking about right now.</v>

1120
00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:14.560
<v Speaker 4>But I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel like it's,</v>

1121
00:49:14.561 --> 00:49:19.561
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more you can take yourself out of </v>

1122
00:49:19.561 --> 00:49:19.561
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more you can say,</v>

1123
00:49:19.561 --> 00:49:20.980
<v Speaker 4>I just want to be the best I can be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to be perfect.</v>

1124
00:49:20.981 --> 00:49:25.060
<v Speaker 4>I want to be all that shit is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that guy's not doing any comedy.</v>

1125
00:49:25.090 --> 00:49:27.250
<v Speaker 4>That's that one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who needs all that?</v>

1126
00:49:27.251 --> 00:49:29.740
<v Speaker 4>That's an annoying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that ego thing.</v>

1127
00:49:29.741 --> 00:49:32.830
<v Speaker 4>That's the creepy part of you that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't want to feed.</v>

1128
00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:38.100
<v Speaker 4>You want that to shrivel up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You want that to shrivel up like a </v>

1129
00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:41.881
<v Speaker 4>witch's tit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I remember that there was a </v>

1130
00:49:41.881 --> 00:49:44.660
<v Speaker 4>lawrence,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Olivia was a famous actor and he'd done </v>

1131
00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:44.660
<v Speaker 4>this production of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1132
00:49:44.660 --> 00:49:46.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of Othello or something like that.</v>

1133
00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:51.300
<v Speaker 4>And he was amazing and everybody came </v>
<v Speaker 4>back and said was the most incredible </v>

1134
00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:51.300
<v Speaker 4>performance and he wasn't really black,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dark mood.</v>

1135
00:49:51.490 --> 00:49:52.020
<v Speaker 4>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1136
00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:53.080
<v Speaker 4>what's the matter?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

1137
00:49:53.320 --> 00:49:55.540
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the greatest performance we've anybody's</v>

1138
00:49:55.541 --> 00:49:56.530
<v Speaker 4>ever seen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he said,</v>

1139
00:49:56.531 --> 00:49:58.990
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just have no idea how to repeat it,</v>

1140
00:49:59.490 --> 00:49:59.960
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1141
00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:02.020
<v Speaker 4>and his thinking was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I sense there,</v>

1142
00:50:02.021 --> 00:50:03.800
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just got to go to.</v>

1143
00:50:03.801 --> 00:50:08.801
<v Speaker 4>Then you got to go zen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotta go Zan and understand that if </v>

1144
00:50:08.801 --> 00:50:09.520
<v Speaker 4>you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that means you could do that.</v>

1145
00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:11.500
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't mean you're going to do it </v>
<v Speaker 4>every night.</v>

1146
00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:12.550
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be nice,</v>

1147
00:50:12.551 --> 00:50:15.940
<v Speaker 4>like there's times when I'm talking on </v>
<v Speaker 4>this podcast where every third or fourth</v>

1148
00:50:15.941 --> 00:50:19.490
<v Speaker 4>fucking word is my fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stupid tongue is hitting my teeth wrong.</v>

1152
00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:31.180
<v Speaker 4>There's ebbs and flows to things.</v>

1153
00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:34.930
<v Speaker 4>There's never a perfect absolute </v>
<v Speaker 4>sustainable rhythm for anything.</v>

1154
00:50:35.110 --> 00:50:35.850
<v Speaker 4>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>

1155
00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:38.110
<v Speaker 4>if Lawrence Olivier can crush it like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1156
00:50:38.290 --> 00:50:43.290
<v Speaker 4>what that means is that he can crush it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like that doesn't mean you're gonna </v>

1157
00:50:43.290 --> 00:50:44.200
<v Speaker 4>crush it like that every night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he crushed it like that lie and it's</v>

1158
00:50:44.201 --> 00:50:47.230
<v Speaker 4>alive when things are live,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a different experience.</v>

1159
00:50:47.231 --> 00:50:49.980
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember in the book of five </v>
<v Speaker 4>rings with me on the fast,</v>

1160
00:50:50.010 --> 00:50:55.010
<v Speaker 4>she says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>practice something enough so that the </v>

1161
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:55.510
<v Speaker 4>thing of itself reveals itself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The spirit reveals that.</v>

1162
00:50:55.511 --> 00:50:57.130
<v Speaker 4>What do you think he meant by that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1163
00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:01.390
<v Speaker 4>because the same thing he meant that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>

1164
00:51:01.650 --> 00:51:06.650
<v Speaker 4>if you know the way broadly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can see it in all things and that's </v>

1165
00:51:08.070 --> 00:51:13.070
<v Speaker 4>the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like the way is the spirit of a </v>

1166
00:51:13.070 --> 00:51:16.771
<v Speaker 4>thing is really excellence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whether it's bowling or golf or archery </v>

1167
00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:20.440
<v Speaker 4>or the spirit of a thing is excellence.</v>

1168
00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:25.710
<v Speaker 4>The spirit of a thing is finding how to </v>
<v Speaker 4>control the body and to get it all </v>

1169
00:51:27.031 --> 00:51:29.350
<v Speaker 4>online or how would you run up and do </v>
<v Speaker 4>that?</v>

1170
00:51:29.351 --> 00:51:30.730
<v Speaker 4>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Three point.</v>

1171
00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:33.850
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or three point foul shot.</v>

1172
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:39.000
<v Speaker 4>Did you ever see that film,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that video of that autistic kid that </v>

1173
00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.850
<v Speaker 4>never played basketball before and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>threw him in on the last game to Brian,</v>

1174
00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:44.800
<v Speaker 4>find this on my twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is incredible shit.</v>

1175
00:51:44.801 --> 00:51:45.910
<v Speaker 4>Matt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Incredible,</v>

1176
00:51:45.911 --> 00:51:47.920
<v Speaker 4>incredible shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This kid,</v>

1177
00:51:47.921 --> 00:51:52.921
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of unrelated,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but this kid has a high functioning </v>

1178
00:51:52.921 --> 00:51:57.151
<v Speaker 4>autistic and they put him in on this a </v>
<v Speaker 4>basketball game and he's like,</v>

1179
00:51:58.060 --> 00:52:03.060
<v Speaker 4>you could tell that the kids like loved </v>
<v Speaker 4>by all these teammates and when they </v>

1180
00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:04.850
<v Speaker 4>take this kid and they finally let him </v>
<v Speaker 4>play in the game.</v>

1181
00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:07.540
<v Speaker 4>So they're one of the last games.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The kid gets up,</v>

1182
00:52:08.170 --> 00:52:09.820
<v Speaker 4>the place goes nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They love him,</v>

1183
00:52:09.821 --> 00:52:13.850
<v Speaker 4>they're cheering for him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He throws his first ball and it's a Mrs.</v>

1184
00:52:14.010 --> 00:52:16.210
<v Speaker 4>by like six feet and they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh Jesus Christ.</v>

1185
00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:21.390
<v Speaker 4>And then he can't miss.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's nailing three pointers from the </v>

1186
00:52:21.390 --> 00:52:24.880
<v Speaker 4>outside and the crowd is going fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>

1187
00:52:25.090 --> 00:52:30.090
<v Speaker 4>This kid misses one shot and then gets </v>
<v Speaker 4>in this insane groove of over and over </v>

1188
00:52:31.211 --> 00:52:33.430
<v Speaker 4>and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>slamming three pointers.</v>

1189
00:52:33.431 --> 00:52:37.380
<v Speaker 4>He won like the school record.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See Mrs.</v>

1190
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:40.510
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not it.</v>

1191
00:52:40.511 --> 00:52:41.350
<v Speaker 4>There's A.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1192
00:52:41.351 --> 00:52:42.310
<v Speaker 4>that's one of them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1193
00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:50.120
<v Speaker 7>But Jay Mac wasn't done.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He kept shooting and kept hitting </v>

1194
00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:50.220
<v Speaker 7>another person.</v>

1195
00:52:50.500 --> 00:52:52.270
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>did you start this like inside of it?</v>

1196
00:52:52.271 --> 00:52:53.130
<v Speaker 4>A little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1197
00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:54.160
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The beginning.</v>

1198
00:52:54.161 --> 00:52:59.161
<v Speaker 4>They show the first basket with which he</v>
<v Speaker 4>misses by like six feet and then they </v>

1199
00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:00.880
<v Speaker 4>went crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at them,</v>

1200
00:53:00.881 --> 00:53:05.881
<v Speaker 4>run on the field,</v>
<v Speaker 4>grab them and picking them up and </v>

1201
00:53:05.881 --> 00:53:06.070
<v Speaker 4>carrying them around their shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine how good that kid must've felt.</v>

1202
00:53:06.071 --> 00:53:08.560
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Athletic director.</v>

1203
00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:13.920
<v Speaker 4>If I retired today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this would be the one thing that I </v>

1204
00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:13.920
<v Speaker 4>talked about forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1205
00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:14.370
<v Speaker 4>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you kidding me?</v>

1206
00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:15.440
<v Speaker 4>Going amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

1207
00:53:15.610 --> 00:53:17.920
<v Speaker 4>That's another word for excellence.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think as you,</v>

1208
00:53:17.950 --> 00:53:22.950
<v Speaker 4>as you speak about it as harmony,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything moving in the way it's </v>

1209
00:53:22.950 --> 00:53:23.020
<v Speaker 4>supposed to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that's what it sounds like you were</v>

1210
00:53:23.021 --> 00:53:28.021
<v Speaker 4>talking about that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that that's a form that's kind of like </v>

1211
00:53:28.021 --> 00:53:28.021
<v Speaker 4>hard</v>

1212
00:53:28.021 --> 00:53:31.370
<v Speaker 2>harmonizing with a frequency man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like getting into something and a and a </v>

1213
00:53:31.370 --> 00:53:32.880
<v Speaker 2>pattern and where everything is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything is firing the way it should.</v>

1214
00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:35.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and and understanding what it,</v>

1215
00:53:35.530 --> 00:53:40.530
<v Speaker 4>what it really is like the more like in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Musashi talking about it's totally </v>

1216
00:53:40.530 --> 00:53:45.121
<v Speaker 4>applicable to standup comedy because in </v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about like the more time you </v>

1217
00:53:45.121 --> 00:53:45.970
<v Speaker 4>practice it in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more you observe it in,</v>

1218
00:53:45.971 --> 00:53:50.971
<v Speaker 4>the more you understand it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more it's what it is reveals itself </v>

1219
00:53:50.971 --> 00:53:54.481
<v Speaker 4>to you and then you know how to operate </v>
<v Speaker 4>and try to achieve excellence within it.</v>

1220
00:53:55.510 --> 00:53:57.280
<v Speaker 4>That's ever it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're almost writing it.</v>

1221
00:53:57.310 --> 00:53:58.180
<v Speaker 4>You're almost,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1222
00:53:58.300 --> 00:54:00.130
<v Speaker 4>it's doing the work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1223
00:54:00.131 --> 00:54:03.460
<v Speaker 4>That's why I think that activities are </v>
<v Speaker 4>really important for people.</v>

1224
00:54:03.490 --> 00:54:06.850
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of people that </v>
<v Speaker 4>unfortunately don't engage in activity.</v>

1225
00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:11.620
<v Speaker 4>They don't engage and don't have hobbies</v>
<v Speaker 4>or anything like that.</v>

1226
00:54:11.621 --> 00:54:16.621
<v Speaker 4>I learn a language or do something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do something that's exciting art of </v>

1227
00:54:16.621 --> 00:54:16.621
<v Speaker 4>learning.</v>

1228
00:54:16.621 --> 00:54:17.390
<v Speaker 2>You know the problem with our education </v>
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>

1229
00:54:17.391 --> 00:54:19.310
<v Speaker 2>Gore Vidal was saying this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that what it was,</v>

1230
00:54:19.311 --> 00:54:23.360
<v Speaker 2>that we don't have an education system </v>
<v Speaker 2>that teaches you how to think.</v>

1231
00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:26.360
<v Speaker 2>We don't play so true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>

1232
00:54:26.390 --> 00:54:27.470
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the,</v>

1233
00:54:27.471 --> 00:54:28.970
<v Speaker 2>there is an art to learning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1234
00:54:28.971 --> 00:54:30.320
<v Speaker 2>There's an art to learning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an art</v>

1235
00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:32.480
<v Speaker 4>art to be in a human beings,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1236
00:54:32.570 --> 00:54:34.250
<v Speaker 4>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And no one teaches us.</v>

1237
00:54:34.251 --> 00:54:37.880
<v Speaker 4>We don't know what the fuck we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're all idiots raising other people,</v>

1238
00:54:37.881 --> 00:54:40.640
<v Speaker 4>bar with the same flaws that we were </v>
<v Speaker 4>raised with.</v>

1239
00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:42.560
<v Speaker 4>There's no manual for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

1240
00:54:42.561 --> 00:54:46.630
<v Speaker 4>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you look at what we consider our,</v>

1241
00:54:47.250 --> 00:54:52.250
<v Speaker 4>our,</v>
<v Speaker 4>our source of education as far as like </v>

1242
00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:53.240
<v Speaker 4>what is distributed to us nightly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's the news?</v>

1243
00:54:53.390 --> 00:54:58.390
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's really the education that </v>

1244
00:54:58.390 --> 00:54:58.390
<v Speaker 4>people have today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Once you get out of school,</v>

1245
00:54:58.390 --> 00:55:03.250
<v Speaker 4>unless you're reading books on your own,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where are you getting your information </v>

1246
00:55:03.250 --> 00:55:03.250
<v Speaker 4>about the world?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're getting it from the fucking news.</v>

1247
00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:07.010
<v Speaker 4>The news doesn't really represent what's</v>
<v Speaker 4>a going on in the world,</v>

1248
00:55:07.011 --> 00:55:12.011
<v Speaker 4>and B,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't say anything about how you </v>

1249
00:55:12.011 --> 00:55:12.011
<v Speaker 4>should be dealing with this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how you should be thinking,</v>

1250
00:55:12.011 --> 00:55:14.660
<v Speaker 4>how we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how we should resolve these issues.</v>

1251
00:55:14.810 --> 00:55:18.170
<v Speaker 4>It's like this tattle tale that just </v>
<v Speaker 4>goes running over and tells us about all</v>

1252
00:55:18.171 --> 00:55:19.910
<v Speaker 4>the fucked up shit that's happening in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the world,</v>

1253
00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:23.300
<v Speaker 4>but they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not a dialogue with a person.</v>

1254
00:55:23.301 --> 00:55:24.830
<v Speaker 4>It's like a source of information</v>

1255
00:55:24.890 --> 00:55:28.480
<v Speaker 2>shy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way that that complaint goes back at</v>

1256
00:55:28.481 --> 00:55:29.830
<v Speaker 2>least 3,500</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

1257
00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:32.500
<v Speaker 2>Socrates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was in his trial said,</v>

1258
00:55:32.770 --> 00:55:35.260
<v Speaker 2>you take a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't take a horse to try to ride</v>

1259
00:55:35.261 --> 00:55:39.070
<v Speaker 2>it and not train it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same applies to a human being.</v>

1260
00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:40.840
<v Speaker 2>You got to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to start with,</v>

1261
00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:45.860
<v Speaker 2>with the notion of he was trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>teach philosophy in the sense that you </v>

1262
00:55:45.860 --> 00:55:48.991
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you better know what questions to ask </v>

1263
00:55:48.991 --> 00:55:48.991
<v Speaker 2>throughout your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we should start with young people,</v>

1264
00:55:48.991 --> 00:55:52.510
<v Speaker 2>educate young people the right way with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the right questions.</v>

1265
00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:54.040
<v Speaker 2>If you don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

1266
00:55:54.041 --> 00:55:56.560
<v Speaker 2>then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got to start with a base almost,</v>

1267
00:55:56.561 --> 00:55:57.660
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

1268
00:55:57.700 --> 00:55:58.390
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1269
00:55:58.870 --> 00:55:59.950
<v Speaker 2>we don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't do that.</v>

1270
00:55:59.951 --> 00:56:01.950
<v Speaker 2>Men were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like learning Jujitsu,</v>

1271
00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:04.170
<v Speaker 2>just learning moves without learning the</v>
<v Speaker 2>principles behind it</v>

1272
00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:05.020
<v Speaker 4>first.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1273
00:56:05.021 --> 00:56:10.021
<v Speaker 4>Well it's also like learning Jujitsu </v>
<v Speaker 4>without going over the real correct </v>

1274
00:56:10.021 --> 00:56:13.340
<v Speaker 4>drills,</v>
<v Speaker 4>learning real life applications and,</v>

1275
00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:14.700
<v Speaker 4>and the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1276
00:56:14.910 --> 00:56:16.440
<v Speaker 4>the way school is set up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1277
00:56:16.470 --> 00:56:17.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

1278
00:56:17.261 --> 00:56:19.540
<v Speaker 4>you motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way school is set up,</v>

1279
00:56:19.541 --> 00:56:24.541
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have x amount of thousand kids and </v>

1280
00:56:24.541 --> 00:56:27.970
<v Speaker 4>they have to get these kids through with</v>
<v Speaker 4>a basic understanding of the building </v>

1281
00:56:27.970 --> 00:56:31.541
<v Speaker 4>blocks of our world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have to understand that they have </v>

1282
00:56:31.541 --> 00:56:34.371
<v Speaker 4>done understanding how to structure a </v>
<v Speaker 4>sentence and they understand they have </v>

1283
00:56:34.371 --> 00:56:37.541
<v Speaker 4>to understand form paragraphs and they </v>
<v Speaker 4>had got to know what happened in the </v>

1284
00:56:37.541 --> 00:56:39.850
<v Speaker 4>past and then you're off on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good luck fucker.</v>

1285
00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:40.970
<v Speaker 4>Stopped College.</v>

1286
00:56:41.030 --> 00:56:46.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You talk about taking yourself out of </v>

1287
00:56:46.030 --> 00:56:47.271
<v Speaker 2>the equation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's an Asian thing more than a </v>

1288
00:56:47.271 --> 00:56:47.271
<v Speaker 2>western thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Certainly more than American.</v>

1289
00:56:47.271 --> 00:56:51.860
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they had Chinese people look at a </v>

1290
00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:51.860
<v Speaker 2>fish tank and then they had Americans </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the fish tank,</v>

1291
00:56:51.860 --> 00:56:52.590
<v Speaker 2>the Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1292
00:56:52.620 --> 00:56:57.620
<v Speaker 2>describe the fish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Chinese described how the </v>

1293
00:56:57.620 --> 00:56:57.960
<v Speaker 2>relationship between the rocks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the seaweed,</v>

1294
00:56:57.961 --> 00:57:02.961
<v Speaker 2>the fish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the boat in there and everything they </v>

1295
00:57:02.961 --> 00:57:02.961
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were looking at the entire,</v>

1296
00:57:02.961 --> 00:57:05.820
<v Speaker 2>the entire picture and that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a lot of it is.</v>

1297
00:57:05.821 --> 00:57:08.430
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a paramedic in a medic,</v>

1298
00:57:08.431 --> 00:57:10.380
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Vietnam for two terms,</v>

1299
00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:15.440
<v Speaker 2>two tours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things he found was that </v>

1300
00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:15.450
<v Speaker 2>the Viet Cong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they get injured,</v>

1301
00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:17.130
<v Speaker 2>they wouldn't go into shock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you could,</v>

1302
00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:19.050
<v Speaker 2>you can interrogate them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't go into shock.</v>

1303
00:57:19.410 --> 00:57:22.080
<v Speaker 2>The Americans get it in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times they go into shock.</v>

1304
00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:23.670
<v Speaker 2>It's very dangerous when you go into </v>
<v Speaker 2>shock,</v>

1305
00:57:23.850 --> 00:57:25.560
<v Speaker 2>which is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what shock is</v>

1306
00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:27.210
<v Speaker 4>the lock.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1307
00:57:27.211 --> 00:57:28.670
<v Speaker 4>But you're trying to flush</v>

1308
00:57:29.210 --> 00:57:32.010
<v Speaker 2>blood from your extremities and go right</v>
<v Speaker 2>to where the wound is.</v>

1309
00:57:32.011 --> 00:57:34.880
<v Speaker 2>Like sort of like the core area and your</v>
<v Speaker 2>body can shut down.</v>

1310
00:57:35.090 --> 00:57:37.340
<v Speaker 2>It's very dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is from panic.</v>

1311
00:57:37.341 --> 00:57:38.300
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's from your,</v>

1312
00:57:38.310 --> 00:57:39.470
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your heart races.</v>

1313
00:57:39.471 --> 00:57:42.680
<v Speaker 2>And instead of slowing down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so why?</v>

1314
00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:47.710
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things was that when an </v>

1315
00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:47.710
<v Speaker 2>American would get shot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd go,</v>

1316
00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:47.710
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been shot.</v>

1317
00:57:47.710 --> 00:57:50.780
<v Speaker 2>And you focus on that wound.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Viet Cong would get shot,</v>

1318
00:57:50.781 --> 00:57:53.990
<v Speaker 2>they were taught.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the whole culture wasn't about you.</v>

1319
00:57:53.991 --> 00:57:57.320
<v Speaker 2>You were a leaf on a very big tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put your attention out there.</v>

1320
00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:02.500
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was kind of one of the things </v>

1321
00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:02.500
<v Speaker 2>he took back from Vietnam because </v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody said to him,</v>

1322
00:58:02.500 --> 00:58:06.401
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been teaching this acting class </v>

1323
00:58:06.401 --> 00:58:06.401
<v Speaker 2>from seven to 12 for five years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen you yawn once,</v>

1324
00:58:06.401 --> 00:58:07.040
<v Speaker 2>not once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he says,</v>

1325
00:58:07.041 --> 00:58:08.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1326
00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:11.540
<v Speaker 2>I don't think about myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm never part of this equation,</v>

1327
00:58:11.541 --> 00:58:12.890
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I learned a long time ago.</v>

1328
00:58:12.891 --> 00:58:14.960
<v Speaker 2>Even if I'm tired,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just a form of energy.</v>

1329
00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:17.930
<v Speaker 2>And I spent a lot of time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If I start worrying about being tired,</v>

1330
00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:19.750
<v Speaker 2>I'll get tired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got he,</v>

1331
00:58:19.751 --> 00:58:23.230
<v Speaker 2>he was 55 and he just was very good at </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking themselves completely out of the.</v>

1332
00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:25.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that the,</v>

1333
00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:29.620
<v Speaker 4>you can definitely trip yourself up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but some bad behavior patterns as far as</v>

1334
00:58:29.621 --> 00:58:34.621
<v Speaker 4>your,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your feeling in your health and the </v>

1335
00:58:34.621 --> 00:58:34.870
<v Speaker 4>negativity that you see in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>environment all over the place.</v>

1336
00:58:34.871 --> 00:58:39.871
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we've all been around that one person </v>

1337
00:58:39.871 --> 00:58:39.871
<v Speaker 4>that just complains about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1338
00:58:39.871 --> 00:58:40.500
<v Speaker 4>oh great,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at the hotel we're staying at.</v>

1339
00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:42.640
<v Speaker 4>Oh fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at this fucking place.</v>

1340
00:58:42.670 --> 00:58:43.920
<v Speaker 4>Oh Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>

1341
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.280

<v Speaker 4>70 [inaudible] like,</v>

1342
00:58:46.330 --> 00:58:47.770
<v Speaker 4>will you shut the fuck up man?</v>

1343

<v Speaker 2>who um,</v>

1344
00:58:49.430 --> 00:58:51.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to speak out of turn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if his name,</v>

1345
00:58:51.351 --> 00:58:56.351
<v Speaker 2>but he's a writer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tried to kill himself and he was </v>

1346
00:58:56.351 --> 00:58:58.670
<v Speaker 2>listening to birds and some girl was </v>
<v Speaker 2>there and she was talking to him and she</v>

1347
00:58:58.671 --> 00:58:59.600
<v Speaker 2>said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen to the birds.</v>

1348
00:58:59.601 --> 00:59:00.530
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what are you here?</v>

1349
00:59:00.531 --> 00:59:01.270
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

1350
00:59:01.310 --> 00:59:02.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't like listening to bird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She said,</v>

1351
00:59:02.571 --> 00:59:03.230
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>

1352
00:59:03.550 --> 00:59:05.080
<v Speaker 2>because they're so beautifully says you </v>
<v Speaker 2>hear.</v>

1353
00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:10.100
<v Speaker 2>But I hear a bunch of animals trying to </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight for territory and scratch out and </v>

1354
00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:10.430
<v Speaker 2>yelling at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And she went,</v>

1355
00:59:10.431 --> 00:59:12.380
<v Speaker 2>hey dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't ruin birds for me man.</v>

1356
00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:15.080
<v Speaker 2>Maybe smart as fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be.</v>

1357
00:59:15.081 --> 00:59:16.160
<v Speaker 2>You're kind of smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1358
00:59:16.370 --> 00:59:18.530
<v Speaker 2>And it really is a question of what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>choose to look at,</v>

1359
00:59:18.531 --> 00:59:19.700
<v Speaker 2>what you choose to hear.</v>

1360
00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:22.070
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how emotionally invested</v>

1361
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:24.380
<v Speaker 2>you choose to be in whether these birds </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight to the death.</v>

1362
00:59:24.470 --> 00:59:25.730
<v Speaker 2>I'll see your belief system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1363
00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:26.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1364
00:59:26.841 --> 00:59:27.170
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1365
00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:28.990
<v Speaker 2>you can change your belief system in </v>
<v Speaker 2>some ways.</v>

1366
00:59:29.510 --> 00:59:32.630
<v Speaker 2>Choosing whether or not you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be affected by all this information.</v>

1367
00:59:32.631 --> 00:59:34.730
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what I was going to say is that the,</v>

1368
00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:37.430
<v Speaker 2>when we were talking about the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1369
00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:43.120
<v Speaker 2>needing some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lesson in how to think and how to </v>

1370
00:59:43.120 --> 00:59:45.680
<v Speaker 2>operate the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the human mind,</v>

1371
00:59:45.700 --> 00:59:49.190
<v Speaker 2>if the human body was the just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1372
00:59:49.191 --> 00:59:54.191
<v Speaker 2>just the human experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If that wasn't an instrument that you </v>

1373
00:59:54.191 --> 00:59:57.881
<v Speaker 2>had to learn to use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about navigating the human life </v>

1374
00:59:58.910 --> 01:00:03.910
<v Speaker 2>with the human body and language and </v>
<v Speaker 2>think about if you came from somewhere </v>

1375
01:00:03.981 --> 01:00:07.400
<v Speaker 2>else and the human body wasn't in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>human experience,</v>

1376
01:00:07.401 --> 01:00:12.290
<v Speaker 2>wasn't just a person living a life but </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather was a ride that you had to figure</v>

1377
01:00:12.291 --> 01:00:13.700
<v Speaker 2>out how to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how to master,</v>

1378
01:00:13.730 --> 01:00:18.730
<v Speaker 2>how to accomplish and that the human </v>
<v Speaker 2>animal with its creative abilities with </v>

1379
01:00:18.741 --> 01:00:21.170
<v Speaker 2>disabilities or reach out to people with</v>
<v Speaker 2>its,</v>

1380
01:00:21.171 --> 01:00:26.171
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ability to build buildings and use </v>

1381
01:00:26.171 --> 01:00:26.171
<v Speaker 2>electricity.</v>

1382
01:00:26.171 --> 01:00:26.171
<v Speaker 2>And all these different things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a.</v>

1383
01:00:26.171 --> 01:00:27.440
<v Speaker 2>that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a vehicle.</v>

1384
01:00:27.740 --> 01:00:28.840
<v Speaker 2>That's what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Learn it,</v>

1385
01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:33.870
<v Speaker 2>learn how to use that vehicle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would have intensive study for a lot</v>

1386
01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:40.520
<v Speaker 2>of just trying to figure out how to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>about the correct way of doing this.</v>

1387
01:00:40.670 --> 01:00:41.900
<v Speaker 2>They would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1388
01:00:41.901 --> 01:00:46.901
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to figure out what is the </v>

1389
01:00:46.901 --> 01:00:46.901
<v Speaker 2>best way to think is the best way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1390
01:00:46.901 --> 01:00:48.980
<v Speaker 2>most beneficial way to you to approach </v>
<v Speaker 2>every project as a,</v>

1391
01:00:49.070 --> 01:00:53.690
<v Speaker 2>as a person moving around in this human </v>
<v Speaker 2>world with this human machine,</v>

1392
01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:55.700
<v Speaker 2>it would be like a super complicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>

1393
01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:01.000
<v Speaker 2>but instead it's just two people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fucking some guy shoots a load in the </v>

1394
01:01:01.161 --> 01:01:03.110
<v Speaker 2>girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she swells up blank.</v>

1395
01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.540
<v Speaker 2>A person comes out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one knows shit.</v>

1396
01:01:05.730 --> 01:01:06.920
<v Speaker 2>Sound effects by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

1397
01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:10.550
<v Speaker 2>So the three of them are standing there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one knows what the fuck is going on.</v>

1398
01:01:10.550 --> 01:01:13.540
<v Speaker 2>And they keep doing the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They keep interacting with each other.</v>

1399
01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:16.550
<v Speaker 2>Same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the way the human,</v>

1400
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:22.270
<v Speaker 2>the way the human being and the human </v>
<v Speaker 2>body interacts with the world is so </v>

1401
01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:25.430
<v Speaker 2>bizarre and complicated and to get it </v>
<v Speaker 2>right and correct.</v>

1402
01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:29.460
<v Speaker 2>Take so much fucking thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a mandate saying Hudl.</v>

1403
01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:34.480
<v Speaker 2>It,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just let these things just go loose </v>

1404
01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:35.010
<v Speaker 2>out into the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1405
01:01:35.870 --> 01:01:40.230
<v Speaker 2>Which is why people are desperate and </v>
<v Speaker 2>lonely and all that.</v>

1406
01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:46.030
<v Speaker 2>We're caught in this machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a real machine going on with </v>

1407
01:01:46.030 --> 01:01:47.450
<v Speaker 2>society today and that machine is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1408
01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:51.920
<v Speaker 2>the building of society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the increasing of bandwidth,</v>

1409
01:01:52.090 --> 01:01:54.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the interconnectivity that's provided by</v>

1410
01:01:54.771 --> 01:01:59.771
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all of that and it's all of that </v>

1411
01:01:59.771 --> 01:02:02.930
<v Speaker 2>with this exponentially increasing </v>
<v Speaker 2>momentum behind it.</v>

1412
01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:08.080
<v Speaker 2>And we're all caught up in that and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're caught up in that and we have </v>

1413
01:02:08.080 --> 01:02:08.900
<v Speaker 2>mortgages and we have bills and we have </v>
<v Speaker 2>all these,</v>

1414
01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:09.720
<v Speaker 2>but we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

1415
01:02:09.721 --> 01:02:12.350
<v Speaker 2>we're doing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're feeding this system.</v>

1416
01:02:12.590 --> 01:02:17.590
<v Speaker 2>We're feeding the system of televisions </v>
<v Speaker 2>and computers and cell phones and new </v>

1417
01:02:17.590 --> 01:02:20.940
<v Speaker 2>clothes and distracting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so distracting.</v>

1418
01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:21.590
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1419
01:02:21.610 --> 01:02:26.610
<v Speaker 2>you start unknowledgeable and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Greeks who I said you go from </v>

1420
01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:27.130
<v Speaker 2>knowledge but you don't jump all the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>to wisdom.</v>

1421
01:02:27.430 --> 01:02:29.290
<v Speaker 2>There's an in between place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is correct.</v>

1422
01:02:29.291 --> 01:02:32.710
<v Speaker 2>Opinion correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Opinion comes from when you study,</v>

1423
01:02:32.711 --> 01:02:35.530
<v Speaker 2>as you're reaching for wisdom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start to develop.</v>

1424
01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:39.310
<v Speaker 2>The world crystallizes around you with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the right teaching and and stuff.</v>

1425
01:02:39.550 --> 01:02:44.550
<v Speaker 2>You start to learn what the what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what sort of the correct way to look at </v>

1426
01:02:44.550 --> 01:02:46.720
<v Speaker 2>and reach and follow the correct opinion</v>
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>

1427
01:02:46.721 --> 01:02:51.721
<v Speaker 2>and then you finally get to a point </v>
<v Speaker 2>where you understand and can explain why</v>

1428
01:02:52.391 --> 01:02:54.820
<v Speaker 2>that is the correct opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That takes a long fucking time.</v>

1429
01:02:54.821 --> 01:02:59.821
<v Speaker 2>That's life mastery in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like what you're saying is </v>

1430
01:02:59.821 --> 01:02:59.821
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1431
01:02:59.821 --> 01:03:03.310
<v Speaker 2>it's we don't have a system and we tried</v>
<v Speaker 2>it with public education,</v>

1432
01:03:03.311 --> 01:03:08.311
<v Speaker 2>but we don't have a way or a system to </v>
<v Speaker 2>really teach people how to live the art.</v>

1433
01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:11.590
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no one knows what the fuck they're doing</v>

1434
01:03:11.591 --> 01:03:13.960
<v Speaker 4>and we the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the people that were raised by,</v>

1435
01:03:13.961 --> 01:03:15.460
<v Speaker 4>they didn't know what the fuck they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing either.</v>

1436
01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:17.950
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my parents are very nice people.</v>

1437
01:03:18.220 --> 01:03:21.550
<v Speaker 4>My mother is a with my step dad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've been together forever.</v>

1438
01:03:21.551 --> 01:03:24.550
<v Speaker 4>It's like they're very nice couple.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're very nice people,</v>

1439
01:03:24.940 --> 01:03:28.360
<v Speaker 4>but they were raised by people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't know shit,</v>

1440
01:03:28.750 --> 01:03:33.750
<v Speaker 4>and their parents were raised by people </v>
<v Speaker 4>who didn't know shit and this era that </v>

1441
01:03:33.971 --> 01:03:37.450
<v Speaker 4>we're living in right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like human beings are just starting</v>

1442
01:03:37.451 --> 01:03:42.451
<v Speaker 4>to wake up and realize that we were all </v>
<v Speaker 4>living in this weird sort of momentous </v>

1443
01:03:43.061 --> 01:03:48.061
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His world that moves on momentum and </v>

1444
01:03:48.061 --> 01:03:50.221
<v Speaker 4>momentum doesn't make any sense at all </v>
<v Speaker 4>and we're all just waking up realizing </v>

1445
01:03:50.221 --> 01:03:52.060
<v Speaker 4>that it was set up by people didn't know</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck they were doing.</v>

1446
01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:55.690
<v Speaker 4>I mean they knew how to build buildings </v>
<v Speaker 4>and knew how to use electricity,</v>

1447
01:03:55.870 --> 01:04:00.730
<v Speaker 4>but no one knew how to teach society how</v>
<v Speaker 4>to chill the fuck out,</v>

1448
01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:05.740
<v Speaker 4>relax and enjoy each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not One fucking person besides like </v>

1449
01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:07.930
<v Speaker 4>Martin Luther King and a few people with</v>
<v Speaker 4>some dreamy speeches.</v>

1450
01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:11.830
<v Speaker 4>Not One person emphasizes that in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>role of government.</v>

1451
01:04:11.980 --> 01:04:16.980
<v Speaker 4>Not One person is pushing that like </v>
<v Speaker 4>can't we figure out a way that human </v>

1452
01:04:17.141 --> 01:04:22.141
<v Speaker 4>beings are just nicer to each other?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can't we figure out a way where there's </v>

1453
01:04:22.141 --> 01:04:25.540
<v Speaker 4>maybe a little bit less profit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but also less pollution and less fucking</v>

1454
01:04:25.541 --> 01:04:30.541
<v Speaker 4>with people and less light,</v>
<v Speaker 4>less control over the human population?</v>

1455
01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:37.780
<v Speaker 2>I would say that you're also dealing </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the residue of of a most of human </v>

1456
01:04:37.780 --> 01:04:42.521
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost all of it has been not enough to </v>

1457
01:04:42.521 --> 01:04:42.521
<v Speaker 2>eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1458
01:04:42.521 --> 01:04:42.521
<v Speaker 2>and dying.</v>

1459
01:04:42.521 --> 01:04:42.521
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1460
01:04:42.521 --> 01:04:44.540
<v Speaker 4>it's no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's been a lot of things that led us</v>

1461
01:04:44.541 --> 01:04:47.510
<v Speaker 4>to this point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is also the first point.</v>

1462
01:04:47.511 --> 01:04:52.511
<v Speaker 4>We have a responsibility as the human </v>
<v Speaker 4>beings that have the first access to </v>

1463
01:04:52.701 --> 01:04:57.701
<v Speaker 4>this sort of information to not be </v>
<v Speaker 4>looked at like a bunch of silly Fox by </v>

1464
01:04:57.701 --> 01:05:00.410
<v Speaker 4>the people of the future because that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>a real problem because if I look back,</v>

1465
01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:05.470
<v Speaker 4>I've been living this life right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just looking at all that silly nonsense </v>

1466
01:05:05.470 --> 01:05:06.860
<v Speaker 4>that human beings are involved with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like everybody.</v>

1467
01:05:06.861 --> 01:05:11.861
<v Speaker 4>I looked on twitter and everybody has </v>
<v Speaker 4>these fucking equal signs on their </v>

1468
01:05:11.861 --> 01:05:15.380
<v Speaker 4>twitter Avatar to let every one know </v>
<v Speaker 4>that they're into marriage equality,</v>

1469
01:05:15.870 --> 01:05:17.410
<v Speaker 4>equality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's marriage equality.</v>

1470
01:05:17.650 --> 01:05:17.980
<v Speaker 4>You</v>

1471
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.600
<v Speaker 3>should be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should be.</v>

1472
01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:22.900
<v Speaker 3>That's like saying you're having that on</v>
<v Speaker 3>your twitter Avatar.</v>

1473
01:05:22.990 --> 01:05:25.780
<v Speaker 3>You might as well just say water's wet </v>
<v Speaker 3>is hot,</v>

1474
01:05:25.781 --> 01:05:27.040
<v Speaker 3>hot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's cold,</v>

1475
01:05:27.041 --> 01:05:27.760
<v Speaker 3>cold.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>

1476
01:05:27.761 --> 01:05:31.210
<v Speaker 3>Of course marriage equality makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fact that you even have to to.</v>

1477
01:05:31.270 --> 01:05:36.270
<v Speaker 3>Who are you talking to who does this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But seriously in 2000 and fucking 13,</v>

1478
01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:41.050
<v Speaker 3>anybody we should find out who doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>have that on their avatar.</v>

1479
01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:42.070
<v Speaker 3>It should be that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's.</v>

1480
01:05:42.071 --> 01:05:44.170
<v Speaker 3>How about nobody use her face anymore </v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1481
01:05:44.171 --> 01:05:44.830
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and let's,</v>

1482
01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:48.390
<v Speaker 3>let's find out and do the people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a problem with it.</v>

1483
01:05:48.391 --> 01:05:52.000
<v Speaker 3>It gives a shit whether or not a couple </v>
<v Speaker 3>of lesbians want to marry each other.</v>

1484
01:05:52.330 --> 01:05:55.360
<v Speaker 3>You're an asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're an asshole.</v>

1485
01:05:55.361 --> 01:05:57.250
<v Speaker 3>And maybe nobody tells you you're an </v>
<v Speaker 3>asshole.</v>

1486
01:05:57.410 --> 01:06:02.410
<v Speaker 3>Why do you give a fuck about them?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You worrying at all about what other </v>

1487
01:06:02.411 --> 01:06:04.540
<v Speaker 3>people are doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sucks.</v>

1488
01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:08.530
<v Speaker 3>It sucks for everyone around you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You fuck everything up.</v>

1489
01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:12.070
<v Speaker 3>You care that two people love each other</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they want to sign some paperwork.</v>

1490
01:06:12.071 --> 01:06:14.200
<v Speaker 3>Why do you give a fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you give a fuck of?</v>

1491

1501
01:06:49.151 --> 01:06:52.540
<v Speaker 3>looking back on the past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they looked at those idiots that</v>

1502
01:06:52.541 --> 01:06:55.390
<v Speaker 3>thought that leaches were the best way </v>
<v Speaker 3>to cure your broken leg.</v>

<v Speaker 4>saying no to them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yet you're just chugging down that </v>

1562
01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:18.650
<v Speaker 4>fucking corn fed beef.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These fatty,</v>

1563
01:09:18.680 --> 01:09:21.410
<v Speaker 4>diseased cows,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fat,</v>

1564
01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:26.680
<v Speaker 4>sloppy heart pounding as they pumps </v>
<v Speaker 4>blood through fucking caked up arteries,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Just to fucking amount of fat that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>get on.</v>

1567
01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:36.590
<v Speaker 4>But that's the only way you get a </v>
<v Speaker 4>delicious Ribeye.</v>

1568
01:09:36.620 --> 01:09:38.090
<v Speaker 4>The kind that you really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1569
01:09:38.091 --> 01:09:40.760
<v Speaker 4>you cook it over a little salt and </v>
<v Speaker 4>pepper.</v>

1570
01:09:40.761 --> 01:09:45.761
<v Speaker 4>Don't get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All you need is a little salt and </v>

1571
01:09:45.761 --> 01:09:45.761
<v Speaker 4>pepper.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The,</v>

1572
01:09:45.761 --> 01:09:46.190
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>grass fed beef though.</v>

1573
01:09:46.191 --> 01:09:48.420
<v Speaker 4>Once you get used to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a.</v>

1574
01:09:48.620 --> 01:09:50.810
<v Speaker 4>to me it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel so much better eating.</v>

1575
01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:52.720
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the oils,</v>

1576
01:09:52.730 --> 01:09:53.510
<v Speaker 4>the oils,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

1577
01:09:53.511 --> 01:09:53.770
<v Speaker 4>the room.</v>

1578
01:09:53.770 --> 01:09:55.220
<v Speaker 4>And it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So cows are supposed to eat grass.</v>

1579
01:09:55.330 --> 01:09:57.320
<v Speaker 4>It would.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're definitely,</v>

1580
01:09:57.321 --> 01:10:00.770
<v Speaker 4>you're eating a healthier and for sure </v>
<v Speaker 4>it tastes more like a game.</v>

1581
01:10:00.830 --> 01:10:05.830
<v Speaker 4>And also the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the oils in the meat are very different </v>

1582
01:10:05.830 --> 01:10:08.681
<v Speaker 4>when they grasp the oils.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fatty acids are,</v>

1583
01:10:09.150 --> 01:10:10.010
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe,</v>

1584
01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:11.870
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember what the ratio is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what it is,</v>

1585
01:10:11.871 --> 01:10:16.871
<v Speaker 4>but the fatty acids literally changed </v>
<v Speaker 4>from like Omega three to Omega six or </v>

1586
01:10:16.871 --> 01:10:16.871
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1587
01:10:16.871 --> 01:10:21.350
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so when you eat at a bison or you eat </v>

1588
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:24.470
<v Speaker 4>grass fed beef,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the oils are healthier and,</v>

1589
01:10:24.530 --> 01:10:25.520
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1590
01:10:25.550 --> 01:10:30.550
<v Speaker 4>heart doctors on Dr Oz are prescribing </v>
<v Speaker 4>grassfed beef because it helps with </v>

1591
01:10:31.191 --> 01:10:36.191
<v Speaker 4>inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It actually brings inflammation in the </v>

1592
01:10:36.191 --> 01:10:36.290
<v Speaker 4>body down according to a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>research.</v>

1593
01:10:36.380 --> 01:10:41.380
<v Speaker 4>That's really interesting because I </v>
<v Speaker 4>talked to a woman who was a </v>

1594
01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:41.600
<v Speaker 4>chiropractor.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were talking about desks,</v>

1595
01:10:41.601 --> 01:10:46.601
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I got a disc issue on my back </v>

1596
01:10:46.601 --> 01:10:48.730
<v Speaker 4>and she said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>besides this thing called the mackenzie </v>

1597
01:10:48.730 --> 01:10:51.341
<v Speaker 4>protocol,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a series of stretches that </v>

1598
01:10:51.341 --> 01:10:53.210
<v Speaker 4>they use to elongate the spine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She said changing the Diet is very </v>

1599
01:10:53.210 --> 01:10:53.690
<v Speaker 4>important.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1600
01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:58.720
<v Speaker 4>she recommended a bunch of different uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anti-inflammatories and cutting out all </v>

1601
01:11:00.110 --> 01:11:01.590
<v Speaker 4>week.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1602
01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:02.630
<v Speaker 4>That that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

1603
01:11:02.631 --> 01:11:07.631
<v Speaker 4>believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like people who are eating gluten and </v>

1604
01:11:07.631 --> 01:11:10.980
<v Speaker 4>like that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more and more people are sort of </v>

1605
01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:13.320
<v Speaker 4>understanding that what you're doing is </v>
<v Speaker 4>just slowly poisoning yourself with that</v>

1606
01:11:13.321 --> 01:11:14.070
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can</v>

1607
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:16.020
<v Speaker 3>handle it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's really what's going on.</v>

1608
01:11:16.050 --> 01:11:18.660
<v Speaker 3>And when you cut it out you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh whoa.</v>

1609
01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:20.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why don't feel so good now?</v>

1610
01:11:21.200 --> 01:11:22.170
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on?</v>

1611
01:11:22.390 --> 01:11:27.390
<v Speaker 3>Like that stuff's not good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I stopped eating bread and also because </v>

1612
01:11:27.390 --> 01:11:29.400
<v Speaker 3>it's got a high glycemic index,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Kinda like spikes your insulin.</v>

1613
01:11:29.430 --> 01:11:33.090
<v Speaker 3>So I eat brown rice and yams and I just </v>
<v Speaker 3>feel better when I do that.</v>

1614
01:11:33.340 --> 01:11:35.580
<v Speaker 3>I do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yet I don't.</v>

1615
01:11:35.610 --> 01:11:38.880
<v Speaker 3>I'm not rigid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still will go to a nice restaurant and</v>

1616
01:11:38.881 --> 01:11:43.680
<v Speaker 3>have locked bread with olive oil and </v>
<v Speaker 3>balsamic vinegar and all the way this is</v>

1617
01:11:43.690 --> 01:11:45.270
<v Speaker 3>salience do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they lived to 105.</v>

1618
01:11:47.100 --> 01:11:49.700
<v Speaker 3>I wonder how much bread they they eat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do they eat a lot of bread?</v>

1619
01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:51.720
<v Speaker 3>You know when you go there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you see the bread they eat.</v>

1620
01:11:51.721 --> 01:11:53.190
<v Speaker 3>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is as healthy.</v>

1621
01:11:53.191 --> 01:11:54.490
<v Speaker 3>It's a meal in itself too.</v>

1622
01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:56.550
<v Speaker 3>It's like you see the bread up in like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1623
01:11:56.551 --> 01:11:58.260
<v Speaker 3>you got to northern Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went to this place.</v>

1624
01:11:58.590 --> 01:12:00.840
<v Speaker 3>I walked into this bread place that </v>
<v Speaker 3>bread is,</v>

1625
01:12:00.970 --> 01:12:02.070
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't look like bread.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1626
01:12:02.071 --> 01:12:06.870
<v Speaker 3>It looks like God just like a block of </v>
<v Speaker 3>seeds and nuts and you're like,</v>

1627
01:12:06.871 --> 01:12:08.910
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are you could hit somebody</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the head and they die.</v>

1628
01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:10.760
<v Speaker 3>My grandfather used to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My,</v>

1629
01:12:10.810 --> 01:12:14.580
<v Speaker 3>my grandfather came over here during the</v>
<v Speaker 3>depression on a,</v>

1630
01:12:14.581 --> 01:12:15.630
<v Speaker 3>on a boat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>

1631
01:12:15.690 --> 01:12:19.710
<v Speaker 3>his family hopped in a boat from Italy </v>
<v Speaker 3>and came up with a fun ride by the way.</v>

1632
01:12:19.830 --> 01:12:24.180
<v Speaker 3>And they lived in this like seriously </v>
<v Speaker 3>Italian neighborhood in New Jersey.</v>

1633
01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:25.750
<v Speaker 3>And we used to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1634
01:12:25.830 --> 01:12:28.620
<v Speaker 3>it was almost dead by the time I got </v>
<v Speaker 3>older.</v>

1635
01:12:28.830 --> 01:12:33.830
<v Speaker 3>But when I lived with them for a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I first moved to New York when I </v>

1636
01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:34.470
<v Speaker 3>was 23,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess 23 or 24.</v>

1637
01:12:34.470 --> 01:12:39.470
<v Speaker 3>I live with my grandfather for like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>year and he would still go by his bread </v>

1638
01:12:39.470 --> 01:12:43.910
<v Speaker 3>from this place in New Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's some people that had been </v>

1639
01:12:43.910 --> 01:12:45.210
<v Speaker 3>there from the 19 fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They had been selling bread.</v>

1640
01:12:45.211 --> 01:12:46.320
<v Speaker 3>And this one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>probably even more,</v>

1641
01:12:46.321 --> 01:12:48.520
<v Speaker 3>I think it was actually the thirties </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were there.</v>

1642
01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:50.340
<v Speaker 3>Real Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

1643
01:12:50.341 --> 01:12:50.790
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1644
01:12:50.791 --> 01:12:55.791
<v Speaker 3>It was just old school bread place and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they would go and get the bread every </v>

1645
01:12:55.791 --> 01:12:59.121
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's how the immigrants like </v>

1646
01:12:59.121 --> 01:12:59.121
<v Speaker 3>dropbox,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

1647
01:12:59.121 --> 01:13:02.480
<v Speaker 3>everything was homemade tomato sauce.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My grandmother was always like cooking </v>

1648
01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:03.560
<v Speaker 3>things and it was always homemade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She,</v>

1649
01:13:03.850 --> 01:13:08.850
<v Speaker 3>they grew their own tomatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They turned them into tomato sauce that </v>

1650
01:13:08.850 --> 01:13:11.981
<v Speaker 3>made their own pasta.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My grandmother would be like rolling </v>

1651
01:13:11.981 --> 01:13:12.350
<v Speaker 3>Pasta and nothing came out of screaming </v>
<v Speaker 3>at my grandfather.</v>

1652
01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:13.620
<v Speaker 8>Get off me,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Joe,</v>

1653
01:13:13.990 --> 01:13:16.840
<v Speaker 8>you leave me alone.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm tired of your bullshit.</v>

1654
01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:19.660
<v Speaker 8>I'm going to tell you right now.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm going to move in with my sister.</v>

1655
01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:21.240
<v Speaker 3>You feel like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1656
01:13:21.241 --> 01:13:26.241
<v Speaker 3>they would go crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My grandparents were Sicilian and so it </v>

1657
01:13:26.241 --> 01:13:26.700
<v Speaker 3>was the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing came out of a can.</v>

1658
01:13:26.730 --> 01:13:28.290
<v Speaker 3>My grandfather's fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1659
01:13:28.291 --> 01:13:33.291
<v Speaker 3>they didn't have kids to know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like the idea of paying for </v>

1660
01:13:33.291 --> 01:13:34.980
<v Speaker 3>something which costs more when you can </v>
<v Speaker 3>grow in your backyard.</v>

1661
01:13:34.981 --> 01:13:35.940
<v Speaker 3>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are you stupid?</v>

1662
01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.130
<v Speaker 3>My grandfather would show up with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>wheel of Parmesan or we'll sit.</v>

1663
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:43.350
<v Speaker 3>We had a food pantry and it would sit in</v>
<v Speaker 3>this big closet like food pantry,</v>

1664
01:13:43.351 --> 01:13:45.000
<v Speaker 3>like it was do you could walk into it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1665
01:13:45.001 --> 01:13:50.001
<v Speaker 3>there's a real issue with with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>cheese in this country and milk in that </v>

1666
01:13:50.001 --> 01:13:54.981
<v Speaker 3>people want everything to be pasteurized</v>
<v Speaker 3>and homogenized and that raw milk when </v>

1667
01:13:54.981 --> 01:13:57.750
<v Speaker 3>it's from an excellent source,</v>
<v Speaker 3>should be available to you,</v>

1668
01:13:57.751 --> 01:14:02.751
<v Speaker 3>just like raw eggs are available to you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like raw meat and it should be </v>

1669
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:06.270
<v Speaker 3>clear and obvious as to whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're eating bad food.</v>

1670
01:14:06.450 --> 01:14:08.160
<v Speaker 3>Like when you're eating a steak.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

1671
01:14:08.161 --> 01:14:13.161
<v Speaker 3>And if you buy a stake and the stake </v>
<v Speaker 3>sits in the refrigerator for like five </v>

1672
01:14:13.161 --> 01:14:13.161
<v Speaker 3>or six days,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't</v>

1673
01:14:13.161 --> 01:14:14.020
<v Speaker 4>get to it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it starts to get a little funky.</v>

1674
01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:19.320
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know why that's because it's a </v>

1675
01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:19.690
<v Speaker 4>fucking thing from an animal and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>used to be alive.</v>

1676
01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:24.040
<v Speaker 4>It's decaying and that Shit's real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And as soon as you stop that process,</v>

1677
01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:25.810
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as soon as you step in,</v>

1678
01:14:25.990 --> 01:14:28.810
<v Speaker 4>you're monkeying around with nature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

1679
01:14:28.811 --> 01:14:29.980
<v Speaker 4>And I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

1680
01:14:29.981 --> 01:14:34.981
<v Speaker 4>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know it's helped a lot of people get </v>

1681
01:14:34.981 --> 01:14:34.981
<v Speaker 4>through some really dark times in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>

1682
01:14:34.981 --> 01:14:37.150
<v Speaker 4>We're milk because it was homogenized </v>
<v Speaker 4>and pasteurized.</v>

1683
01:14:37.270 --> 01:14:39.740
<v Speaker 4>They could keep it longer and it fed </v>
<v Speaker 4>people sure,</v>

1684
01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:45.120
<v Speaker 4>but at a certain point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have to realize that all that </v>

1685
01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:46.360
<v Speaker 4>homogenization and pasteurization is not</v>
<v Speaker 4>the healthy way to do it.</v>

1686
01:14:46.480 --> 01:14:49.070
<v Speaker 4>The healthy way to do it is to eat it </v>
<v Speaker 4>fresh like it.</v>

1687
01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:54.100
<v Speaker 4>They like the healthy way to do anything</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then it becomes this industry with </v>

1688
01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:58.381
<v Speaker 4>taking this milk and changing it through</v>
<v Speaker 4>this process of homogenization and </v>

1689
01:14:59.321 --> 01:14:59.950
<v Speaker 4>pasteurization.</v>

1690
01:14:59.950 --> 01:15:01.090
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what happens to those people?</v>

1691
01:15:01.310 --> 01:15:04.090
<v Speaker 4>What if you don't have to homogenize the</v>
<v Speaker 4>pasteurized milk and what will be out of</v>

1692
01:15:04.091 --> 01:15:05.020
<v Speaker 4>business?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>

1693
01:15:05.021 --> 01:15:10.021
<v Speaker 4>Charlie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been given you a lot of money all </v>

1694
01:15:10.021 --> 01:15:10.021
<v Speaker 4>these years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've supported you for governor and 84 I</v>

1695
01:15:10.021 --> 01:15:14.260
<v Speaker 4>support to you again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've got to make raw milk Hillier so </v>

1696
01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:14.260
<v Speaker 4>they illegal firearms,</v>
<v Speaker 4>safety.</v>

1697
01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:16.870
<v Speaker 4>They arrest people for selling Rondo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't get raw cheese.</v>

1698
01:15:16.871 --> 01:15:21.871
<v Speaker 4>Raw Cheese is super fucking hard to get </v>
<v Speaker 4>man because they want you to use </v>

1699
01:15:21.871 --> 01:15:25.831
<v Speaker 4>homogenized and pasteurized milk because</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it's just some joe blow farmer who </v>

1700
01:15:25.831 --> 01:15:28.060
<v Speaker 4>has no access to homogenization </v>
<v Speaker 4>pasteurization,</v>

1701
01:15:28.061 --> 01:15:30.880
<v Speaker 4>just start selling his milk and people </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually like it.</v>

1702
01:15:31.050 --> 01:15:33.340
<v Speaker 4>What the fucking world could end.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's my problem.</v>

1703
01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:35.050
<v Speaker 4>And and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's where,</v>

1704
01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:40.080
<v Speaker 4>that's why the only thing we should all </v>
<v Speaker 4>be talking about is campaign finance </v>

1705
01:15:40.080 --> 01:15:41.410
<v Speaker 4>reform.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea that money in politics,</v>

1706
01:15:41.411 --> 01:15:46.411
<v Speaker 4>as long as there's money in politics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to have very powerful </v>

1707
01:15:46.411 --> 01:15:49.900
<v Speaker 4>wealthy interests controlling even what </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fuck you eat.</v>

1708
01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:50.440
<v Speaker 4>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1709
01:15:50.441 --> 01:15:55.441
<v Speaker 4>and I think it's not a bad option.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what I want to say because if </v>

1710
01:15:55.441 --> 01:16:00.010
<v Speaker 4>you are in a low income household and </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're in a situation where when you buy</v>

1711
01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:03.100
<v Speaker 4>a gallon of milk,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that gallon of milk needs to all be</v>

1712
01:16:03.101 --> 01:16:06.610
<v Speaker 4>used,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it goes the pasteurized milk and if,</v>

1713
01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:07.650
<v Speaker 4>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1714
01:16:07.660 --> 01:16:10.450
<v Speaker 4>if it lasts for a week and a half with </v>
<v Speaker 4>pasteurization,</v>

1715
01:16:10.451 --> 01:16:12.640
<v Speaker 4>but it only lasts three days and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>raw,</v>

1716
01:16:12.790 --> 01:16:14.160
<v Speaker 4>that fucks your family.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure.</v>

1717
01:16:14.161 --> 01:16:16.990
<v Speaker 4>And I completely understand that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what we have to look at then,</v>

1718
01:16:16.991 --> 01:16:18.830
<v Speaker 4>if you were looking at a holistic </v>
<v Speaker 4>approach,</v>

1719
01:16:18.831 --> 01:16:23.260
<v Speaker 4>is how do we eliminate that from </v>
<v Speaker 4>civilized society?</v>

1720
01:16:23.290 --> 01:16:28.290
<v Speaker 4>How do we eliminate people that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>working in such poverty that they're </v>

1721
01:16:28.290 --> 01:16:31.450
<v Speaker 4>worried about their milk being bad?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it goes three days like milk,</v>

1722
01:16:31.451 --> 01:16:33.000
<v Speaker 4>how much milk costs?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what does milk,</v>

1723
01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:34.590
<v Speaker 4>like four bucks or something like that.</v>

1724
01:16:35.230 --> 01:16:36.850
<v Speaker 4>For a lot of people that's a deal </v>
<v Speaker 4>breaker.</v>

1725
01:16:36.851 --> 01:16:37.150
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

1726
01:16:37.170 --> 01:16:37.540
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

1727
01:16:37.541 --> 01:16:38.950
<v Speaker 4>they're really trying to put it all </v>
<v Speaker 4>together.</v>

1728
01:16:39.250 --> 01:16:41.860
<v Speaker 4>That's kind of fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's kind of crazy that,</v>

1729
01:16:41.861 --> 01:16:46.861
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some guy could be working in a job all </v>

1730
01:16:46.861 --> 01:16:51.451
<v Speaker 4>day every day and then they take taxes </v>
<v Speaker 4>out of that and then when you look at </v>

1731
01:16:51.451 --> 01:16:55.681
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he still doesn't have enough money to </v>

1732
01:16:55.681 --> 01:16:57.330
<v Speaker 4>eat natural food.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where the food stamps program </v>

1733
01:16:57.330 --> 01:16:57.330
<v Speaker 4>comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all those things.</v>

1734
01:16:57.330 --> 01:16:58.870
<v Speaker 4>All those answers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not the answer,</v>

1735
01:16:58.871 --> 01:17:01.930
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The answer is sort of a restructuring of</v>

1736
01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:06.960
<v Speaker 4>how much your time is worth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what is in figuring out also how to</v>

1737
01:17:07.901 --> 01:17:10.070
<v Speaker 4>fund some way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's the,</v>

1738
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:11.070
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1739
01:17:11.071 --> 01:17:15.380
<v Speaker 1>the society we live in is really sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a really nutty game,</v>

1740
01:17:15.710 --> 01:17:20.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finding your spot in that game and </v>

1741
01:17:20.710 --> 01:17:23.831
<v Speaker 1>finding had six points from that game </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you just said is finding your </v>

1742
01:17:23.831 --> 01:17:27.700
<v Speaker 1>spots because the dea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as technology grows exponentially and </v>

1743
01:17:27.700 --> 01:17:29.030
<v Speaker 1>our economy will start to change </v>
<v Speaker 1>exponentially.</v>

1744
01:17:29.490 --> 01:17:34.490
<v Speaker 1>There isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to figure out how to make </v>

1745
01:17:34.490 --> 01:17:36.701
<v Speaker 1>yourself useful and traditional labor </v>
<v Speaker 1>and things is not going to be worth and </v>

1746
01:17:38.850 --> 01:17:43.310
<v Speaker 1>stand already is this case is not going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be worth what it was when a robot can</v>

1747
01:17:43.311 --> 01:17:45.380
<v Speaker 1>do it and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then then where does,</v>

1748
01:17:45.381 --> 01:17:47.210
<v Speaker 1>where does a human being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where are you?</v>

1749
01:17:47.211 --> 01:17:48.680
<v Speaker 1>What is your skill set?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have to be.</v>

1750
01:17:48.681 --> 01:17:53.681
<v Speaker 1>My guess is you're going to have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly be taking classes and </v>

1751
01:17:53.681 --> 01:17:55.940
<v Speaker 1>constantly be changing and constantly be</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping up with a,</v>

1752
01:17:55.941 --> 01:18:00.380
<v Speaker 1>with an economy that is always moving at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the speed of life.</v>

1753
01:18:00.410 --> 01:18:01.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

1754
01:18:01.040 --> 01:18:02.650
<v Speaker 1>it's moving very quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Speed of life.</v>

1755
01:18:02.651 --> 01:18:05.780
<v Speaker 1>That's a funny thing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the speed of life and that's really what</v>

1756
01:18:05.781 --> 01:18:10.781
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like this beautiful life is constantly </v>

1757
01:18:10.781 --> 01:18:12.881
<v Speaker 1>ever changing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to think that somehow or another </v>

1758
01:18:12.881 --> 01:18:12.881
<v Speaker 1>you're obligated to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have a job.</v>

1759
01:18:12.881 --> 01:18:14.750
<v Speaker 1>I've been a cobbler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My family were cobblers.</v>

1760
01:18:14.751 --> 01:18:16.340
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't make shoes anymore.</v>

1761
01:18:16.910 --> 01:18:18.980
<v Speaker 1>Change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't change what?</v>

1762
01:18:18.981 --> 01:18:22.220
<v Speaker 1>Either that or make some shoes that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>undeniably dope.</v>

1763
01:18:22.630 --> 01:18:27.630
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants to go to your shoe store</v>
<v Speaker 1>and buy your handmade shoes because </v>

1764
01:18:27.630 --> 01:18:30.851
<v Speaker 1>they're so fucking bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But unless you attain that sort of </v>

1765
01:18:30.851 --> 01:18:31.220
<v Speaker 1>perfection at your craft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not gonna attract people.</v>

1766
01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:32.460
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1767
01:18:32.590 --> 01:18:34.490
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to find something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that like.</v>

1768
01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:38.360
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if you were like really into </v>
<v Speaker 1>owning a record store and you're like,</v>

1769
01:18:38.361 --> 01:18:38.810
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look.</v>

1770
01:18:38.811 --> 01:18:40.070
<v Speaker 1>Everybody needs records.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1771
01:18:40.071 --> 01:18:40.610
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1772
01:18:40.611 --> 01:18:41.810
<v Speaker 1>record store is always going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

1773
01:18:42.050 --> 01:18:47.050
<v Speaker 1>It's a great investment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take my money and I put it </v>

1774
01:18:47.050 --> 01:18:47.050
<v Speaker 1>in her records because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's talk about this.</v>

1775
01:18:47.050 --> 01:18:51.220
<v Speaker 1>Economists always talk about how things </v>
<v Speaker 1>become obsolete and there's always got </v>

1776
01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:51.220
<v Speaker 1>to be there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

1777
01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:55.241
<v Speaker 1>the economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A capitalist economy is based on the </v>

1778
01:18:55.241 --> 01:18:56.150
<v Speaker 1>notion that here's how they do it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to come along and do it better</v>

1779
01:18:56.151 --> 01:19:01.151
<v Speaker 1>for a premium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll come up with a better way to do </v>

1780
01:19:01.151 --> 01:19:01.400
<v Speaker 1>what you're doing and that's the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1781
01:19:01.401 --> 01:19:02.870
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you always got a better car for you,</v>

1782
01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:03.800
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your car is breaking down.</v>

1783
01:19:03.801 --> 01:19:04.790
<v Speaker 1>I got a better car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1784
01:19:04.791 --> 01:19:07.110
<v Speaker 1>I'll fix that problem for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will sort of be.</v>

1785
01:19:07.150 --> 01:19:12.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are always constantly improving </v>

1786
01:19:12.150 --> 01:19:13.901
<v Speaker 1>things and that's one of the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>fascinating things about the human </v>

1787
01:19:13.901 --> 01:19:13.901
<v Speaker 1>condition to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1788
01:19:13.901 --> 01:19:16.080
<v Speaker 1>I loved that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got the apple retina laptop thing.</v>

1789
01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:18.980
<v Speaker 1>Look skinny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny and light.</v>

1790
01:19:19.310 --> 01:19:24.310
<v Speaker 1>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love and you don't need any more </v>

1791
01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:24.310
<v Speaker 1>computer than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like I can,</v>

1792
01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:24.310
<v Speaker 1>I can follow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're so wrong.</v>

1793
01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:25.530
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they come up with a new one,</v>

1794
01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:28.310
<v Speaker 1>it's saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1795
01:19:28.850 --> 01:19:30.460
<v Speaker 1>it's not a huge difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>

1796
01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:32.030
<v Speaker 1>once you get that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all unique.</v>

1797
01:19:32.420 --> 01:19:37.420
<v Speaker 1>It's very easy now to get everything you</v>
<v Speaker 1>need as far as like a visual experience </v>

1798
01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:39.920
<v Speaker 1>or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or just access to information I think to</v>

1799
01:19:40.150 --> 01:19:45.150
<v Speaker 1>try to deny or slow down the idea that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to continue to pump out </v>

1800
01:19:45.261 --> 01:19:50.261
<v Speaker 1>newer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>greater crazier shit and that you're </v>

1801
01:19:50.261 --> 01:19:51.380
<v Speaker 1>going to continue to want it lustfully.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ridiculous at this point.</v>

1802
01:19:51.740 --> 01:19:53.600
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking ridiculous.</v>

1803
01:19:53.660 --> 01:19:58.660
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a part of what humans are and your </v>

1804
01:19:58.660 --> 01:19:59.750
<v Speaker 1>attraction to it is just like your </v>
<v Speaker 1>attraction to tits.</v>

1805
01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:05.140
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make a whole lot of sense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you know you're never </v>

1806
01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:05.270
<v Speaker 1>going to be able to touch them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a girl was great.</v>

1807
01:20:05.271 --> 01:20:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Tits can walk into a room and you just </v>
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

1808
01:20:06.910 --> 01:20:07.410
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1809
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:12.900
<v Speaker 3>the whole fucking good kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just looked at him this round or they</v>

1810
01:20:12.901 --> 01:20:17.901
<v Speaker 3>move when she moves and every girl in </v>
<v Speaker 3>the room was pissed because she's not </v>

1811
01:20:17.901 --> 01:20:17.901
<v Speaker 3>wearing a bra.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1812
01:20:17.901 --> 01:20:20.640
<v Speaker 3>that fucking bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe she's not wearing a bra.</v>

1813
01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:22.620
<v Speaker 3>What a fucking whore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All my God.</v>

1814
01:20:22.621 --> 01:20:25.380
<v Speaker 3>I can't believe she's not wearing a bra.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She shows up in life I can think,</v>

1815
01:20:25.381 --> 01:20:27.210
<v Speaker 3>and she's not even wearing a bra,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this fucking pig.</v>

1816
01:20:27.211 --> 01:20:31.230
<v Speaker 3>She shows up her tits or Pocan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ask Dick in the room,</v>

1817
01:20:32.990 --> 01:20:37.990
<v Speaker 3>otherwise known as many women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember when I was with a bunch of </v>

1818
01:20:37.990 --> 01:20:37.990
<v Speaker 3>girls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1819
01:20:37.990 --> 01:20:38.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>long time ago,</v>

1820
01:20:38.450 --> 01:20:41.570
<v Speaker 3>and then this girl comes in and she had </v>
<v Speaker 3>eyeliner on and she had like.</v>

1821
01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:43.740
<v Speaker 3>She'd drawn a line around her lips.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had this.</v>

1822
01:20:43.741 --> 01:20:48.741
<v Speaker 3>She was like really kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had high heels and all the girls </v>

1823
01:20:48.741 --> 01:20:48.741
<v Speaker 3>were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1824
01:20:48.741 --> 01:20:48.741
<v Speaker 3>look at how gross she is.</v>

1825
01:20:48.741 --> 01:20:51.510
<v Speaker 3>She's just so fucking trashy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>

1826
01:20:51.511 --> 01:20:56.220
<v Speaker 3>that's what I call 1000 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy's type.</v>

1827
01:20:56.221 --> 01:21:01.221
<v Speaker 3>You fucking fucking boring white chicks </v>
<v Speaker 3>from Connecticut with your flat shoes </v>

1828
01:21:01.921 --> 01:21:06.921
<v Speaker 3>and your shitty genes goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>holds those hot girls.</v>

1829
01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:13.980

01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:46.110
<v Speaker 3>Have you liked me anyway because you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have a reoccurring theme.</v>

1872
01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:48.870
<v Speaker 3>You have a reoccurring theme.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're accepting.</v>

1873
01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:50.250
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm not that.</v>

1875
01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:52.860
<v Speaker 3>I'm not this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not that,</v>

1876
01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:54.720
<v Speaker 3>but under this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

1877
01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:58.620
<v Speaker 3>That's a reoccurring thing like it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is very self defining.</v>

1878
01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:03.800
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been been writing script about </v>

1879
01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:03.800
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1880
01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:04.170
<v Speaker 3>but I got to speak about that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go.</v>

1881
01:23:04.580 --> 01:23:07.580
<v Speaker 3>No Way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Started Paul Riser.</v>

1882
01:23:07.820 --> 01:23:08.350
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he is.</v>

1883
01:23:09.270 --> 01:23:13.360
<v Speaker 3>Paul Pfizer and Paul and no disrespect </v>
<v Speaker 3>to Paul Riser.</v>

1884
01:23:13.361 --> 01:23:14.860
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I loved him and aliens.</v>

1885
01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:21.080
<v Speaker 3>That was his greatest movie ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>auditioned for Paul Riser once you ever </v>

1886
01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:22.660
<v Speaker 3>see him in aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wasn't a funny role at all.</v>

1887
01:23:22.661 --> 01:23:25.120
<v Speaker 3>It was like a really creepy guy role and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fucking nailed it.</v>

1888
01:23:25.150 --> 01:23:27.880
<v Speaker 3>Is acting was so believable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1889
01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:30.550
<v Speaker 3>Fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He played a real creep man and he did an</v>

1890
01:23:30.551 --> 01:23:31.620
<v Speaker 3>awesome job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

1891
01:23:31.730 --> 01:23:36.730
<v Speaker 3>that's a great role.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was amazed that he never did more </v>

1892
01:23:36.730 --> 01:23:38.260
<v Speaker 3>serious roles because he was so good in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1893
01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:40.290
<v Speaker 3>I mean maybe he didn't enjoy it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

1894
01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:45.390
<v Speaker 3>I mean he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was in one of the greatest horror </v>

1895
01:23:45.390 --> 01:23:45.390
<v Speaker 3>movies of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1896
01:23:45.390 --> 01:23:49.321
<v Speaker 3>why not just cut your losses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he went and did like a lot of </v>

1897
01:23:49.321 --> 01:23:49.321
<v Speaker 3>comedies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was awesome.</v>

1898
01:23:49.321 --> 01:23:50.980
<v Speaker 3>Just made so much money on mad about </v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

1899
01:23:50.981 --> 01:23:53.260
<v Speaker 3>I think you make $50,</v>
<v Speaker 3>million dollars.</v>

1900
01:23:54.670 --> 01:23:57.490
<v Speaker 3>We had some cameramen that said Helen </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hunt was mean.</v>

1901
01:23:58.540 --> 01:24:01.810
<v Speaker 3>I've heard that people get sick.</v>

<v Speaker 3>They get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She probably wanted to be in theater or </v>

1903
01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:07.210
<v Speaker 3>perhaps film won an Oscar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say.</v>

1904
01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:08.780
<v Speaker 3>I've actually had a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations with.</v>

1905
01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:09.790
<v Speaker 3>Very cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1906
01:24:09.791 --> 01:24:14.791
<v Speaker 3>You never know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She didn't want to be on that Shitty </v>

1907
01:24:14.791 --> 01:24:15.820
<v Speaker 3>Sitcom that I understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is torture.</v>

1908
01:24:15.821 --> 01:24:16.630
<v Speaker 3>Sixth Year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1909
01:24:16.870 --> 01:24:18.520
<v Speaker 3>And I would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do not.</v>

1910
01:24:18.670 --> 01:24:19.190
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1911
01:24:19.191 --> 01:24:22.090
<v Speaker 3>I am absolutely not saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh poor them.</v>

1912
01:24:22.210 --> 01:24:23.470
<v Speaker 3>To you folks out there and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1913
01:24:23.471 --> 01:24:26.050
<v Speaker 3>I'll take that fucking job at a </v>
<v Speaker 3>heartbeat and I know you would,</v>

1914
01:24:26.051 --> 01:24:28.780
<v Speaker 3>and you're right in saying that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and yes it is a good job,</v>

1915
01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:34.200
<v Speaker 3>but there's something about doing a </v>
<v Speaker 3>really bad show that his soul stealing.</v>

1916
01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:40.080
<v Speaker 3>Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've only been involved in one bad </v>

1917
01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:43.441
<v Speaker 3>sitcom ever done some pilots that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>so bad that I was hiding in my dressing </v>

1918
01:24:43.441 --> 01:24:45.340
<v Speaker 3>room because I need good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>funny people around.</v>

1919
01:24:45.730 --> 01:24:47.050
<v Speaker 3>If I'm doing a TV show can be shitty.</v>

1920
01:24:47.050 --> 01:24:52.050
<v Speaker 3>If I liked the people around me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll bear with it for a long time </v>

1921
01:24:52.050 --> 01:24:52.120
<v Speaker 3>because the acting gets in the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just fucking around all day.</v>

1922
01:24:52.290 --> 01:24:55.270
<v Speaker 3>I take one pilots.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I probably did.</v>

1923
01:24:55.271 --> 01:25:00.010
<v Speaker 3>I did like one one big pilot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was an interesting one for this thing</v>

1924
01:25:00.011 --> 01:25:01.690
<v Speaker 3>called overseas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

1925
01:25:01.691 --> 01:25:04.360
<v Speaker 3>I remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember you got that.</v>

1926
01:25:04.470 --> 01:25:05.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>With the,</v>

1927
01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:10.680
<v Speaker 3>the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I was on news radio and he was </v>

1928
01:25:10.680 --> 01:25:11.220
<v Speaker 3>trying to find one guy to play this </v>
<v Speaker 3>piece.</v>

1929
01:25:11.350 --> 01:25:14.950
<v Speaker 3>Core Group of Peace Corps guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like something along those funny.</v>

1930
01:25:14.951 --> 01:25:16.300
<v Speaker 3>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was funny.</v>

1931
01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:21.750
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows why people do and don't do </v>

1932
01:25:21.750 --> 01:25:24.160
<v Speaker 3>certain projects or some pilots go and </v>
<v Speaker 3>then other shows that are just terrible.</v>

1933
01:25:24.161 --> 01:25:26.230
<v Speaker 3>Just stay on the air for a long period </v>
<v Speaker 3>of time.</v>

1934
01:25:26.620 --> 01:25:29.860
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't make any sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the process is fucking hard.</v>

1935
01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:34.920
<v Speaker 3>It's not easy to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like creating a new show and </v>

1936
01:25:34.920 --> 01:25:37.330
<v Speaker 3>figuring out the right way to do it and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the right character and you know,</v>

1937
01:25:37.331 --> 01:25:40.760
<v Speaker 3>and then how much wacky neighbor do we </v>
<v Speaker 3>need and this is not.</v>

1938
01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:43.300
<v Speaker 3>That's like a super complicated thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's chemistry,</v>

1939
01:25:43.301 --> 01:25:44.020
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a.</v>

1940
01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:46.700
<v Speaker 3>all these moving parts have to work in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1941
01:25:47.230 --> 01:25:49.540
<v Speaker 3>Alec Baldwin said one time when a </v>
<v Speaker 3>movie's successful,</v>

1942
01:25:49.541 --> 01:25:51.400
<v Speaker 3>it's a fucking accident.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>

1943
01:25:51.430 --> 01:25:55.270
<v Speaker 3>and the reason it's an accident is there</v>
<v Speaker 3>are so many moving parts that any little</v>

1944
01:25:55.271 --> 01:25:57.280
<v Speaker 3>thing can go wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including the weather,</v>

1945

<v Speaker 3>including some crazy shoots up a movie </v>
<v Speaker 3>theater,</v>

1946
01:25:59.801 --> 01:26:03.010
<v Speaker 3>including whatever it might be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if not,</v>

1947
01:26:03.050 --> 01:26:06.830
<v Speaker 3>if everything isn't working perfectly </v>
<v Speaker 3>and uses the gym,</v>

1948
01:26:06.860 --> 01:26:09.650
<v Speaker 3>the gym carry the ace Ventura thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was doing the getaway.</v>

1949
01:26:09.830 --> 01:26:12.080
<v Speaker 3>It was this huge movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kim bessinger him.</v>

1950
01:26:12.081 --> 01:26:16.490
<v Speaker 3>They were the remake of the Steve </v>
<v Speaker 3>McQueen thing is biggest movie and along</v>

1951

<v Speaker 3>not all this tracking that way and along</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes this little movie called Ace </v>

1953
01:26:23.261 --> 01:26:27.020
<v Speaker 3>Ventura pet detective and fucking just </v>
<v Speaker 3>steals the whole show,</v>

1954
01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:29.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he was saying if a movie does really</v>

1955
01:26:29.211 --> 01:26:30.800
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a fucking accident man.</v>

1956
01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:34.340
<v Speaker 3>Everything's got to be as terror.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pet detective probably did greg,</v>

1957
01:26:34.341 --> 01:26:35.510
<v Speaker 3>because they love Jim Carrey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

1958
01:26:35.511 --> 01:26:38.360
<v Speaker 3>or the fuck you want because nobody saw </v>
<v Speaker 3>that coming.</v>

1959
01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:39.660
<v Speaker 3>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody saw that coming.</v>

1960
01:26:39.670 --> 01:26:40.060
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1961
01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:40.850
<v Speaker 3>we've got Jim Carrey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1962
01:26:40.851 --> 01:26:41.750
<v Speaker 3>What are you going to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jim?</v>

1963
01:26:41.780 --> 01:26:46.780
<v Speaker 3>Good character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does this fucking wacky over the top </v>

1964
01:26:46.780 --> 01:26:47.630
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody loves it.</v>

1965
01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:48.870
<v Speaker 3>I died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1966
01:26:49.010 --> 01:26:52.100
<v Speaker 3>I had so many people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw a critically at the time they were</v>

1967
01:26:52.101 --> 01:26:55.540
<v Speaker 3>just destroying that movie and talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about what if he says shit,</v>

1968
01:26:55.550 --> 01:26:57.840
<v Speaker 3>it is howling,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that,</v>

1969
01:26:57.980 --> 01:27:02.360
<v Speaker 3>that idea that everybody needs to do the</v>
<v Speaker 3>same kind of comedy is so stupid.</v>

1970
01:27:02.420 --> 01:27:06.260
<v Speaker 3>Like you can't appreciate a wacky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know that you like Lewis Black,</v>

1971
01:27:06.290 --> 01:27:09.050
<v Speaker 3>but can't you like a wacky guy too?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what do you,</v>

1972
01:27:09.170 --> 01:27:11.230
<v Speaker 3>why are you like holding them back?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many snap,</v>

1973
01:27:11.231 --> 01:27:12.140
<v Speaker 3>man?</v>

1975
01:27:13.310 --> 01:27:14.030
<v Speaker 3>How did that move?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You do?</v>

1976
01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:16.100
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I heard it was awful.</v>

1977
01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:17.240
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

1978
01:27:17.690 --> 01:27:20.220
<v Speaker 3>It's a magic carrie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then Steve Carell and all.</v>

1979
01:27:20.260 --> 01:27:21.590
<v Speaker 3>It's a new movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't he?</v>

1980
01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:24.980
<v Speaker 3>Didn't he get in trouble because he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>making fun of Charlton Heston?</v>

1981
01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:27.110
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1982
01:27:27.111 --> 01:27:28.730
<v Speaker 3>he did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see the video.</v>

1983
01:27:28.750 --> 01:27:30.380
<v Speaker 3>Do you want to watch it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's pull it up.</v>

1984
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:33.230
<v Speaker 3>Apparently he did some controversial </v>
<v Speaker 3>video where he was,</v>

1985
01:27:33.231 --> 01:27:38.231
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was mocking Charlton Heston who's </v>

1986
01:27:38.231 --> 01:27:40.940
<v Speaker 3>dead and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of his famous keep brushing me.</v>

1987
01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:41.820
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1988
01:27:41.830 --> 01:27:42.140
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

1989
01:27:42.141 --> 01:27:42.940
<v Speaker 3>From you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1990
01:27:42.950 --> 01:27:44.840
<v Speaker 3>you'd taken my rifle when he prime my </v>
<v Speaker 3>cold,</v>

1991
01:27:44.841 --> 01:27:47.060
<v Speaker 3>dead cold hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1992
01:27:47.090 --> 01:27:52.090
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>apparently a Jim Carey took that out of </v>

1993
01:27:52.090 --> 01:27:52.090
<v Speaker 3>context.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who apparently.</v>

1994
01:27:52.090 --> 01:27:53.840
<v Speaker 3>Michael Morris.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no out of context.</v>

1995
01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:57.230
<v Speaker 3>This is out of context.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you say you'll take my rifle out of</v>

1996
01:27:57.231 --> 01:28:02.231
<v Speaker 3>my cold dead hands.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's impossible to take that out of </v>

1997
01:28:02.231 --> 01:28:02.570
<v Speaker 3>context.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You only say that when either a,</v>

1998
01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:05.600
<v Speaker 3>you're joking around or be your fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>psycho.</v>

1999
01:28:05.930 --> 01:28:09.500
<v Speaker 3>There's one or two things and I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>that Charlton Heston was a fucking side.</v>

2000
01:28:09.530 --> 01:28:11.630
<v Speaker 3>There's the third thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was just being dramatic.</v>

2001
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:12.950
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's a psycho.</v>

2002
01:28:13.290 --> 01:28:15.020
<v Speaker 3>That guy like guns and.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2003
01:28:15.021 --> 01:28:16.400
<v Speaker 3>you were going to have to kill them for </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

2004
01:28:17.210 --> 01:28:20.210
<v Speaker 3>Do we have the video,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the funny or die video?</v>

2005
01:28:20.270 --> 01:28:21.380
<v Speaker 3>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2006
01:28:21.381 --> 01:28:22.960
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see this because I.</v>

2007
01:28:23.360 --> 01:28:26.990
<v Speaker 3>This is the first time saying that it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>hall.</v>

2008
01:28:29.530 --> 01:28:33.760
<v Speaker 9>Why did the Ventriloquist quit drinking?</v>
<v Speaker 9>He was I.</v>

2009
01:28:33.761 --> 01:28:34.520
<v Speaker 9>I'd like a room.</v>

2010
01:28:34.860 --> 01:28:35.030
<v Speaker 10>Yeah.</v>

2011
01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:40.790
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I and how to find folks and welcome back</v>

2012
01:28:40.791 --> 01:28:42.900
<v Speaker 3>to d hall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a really long video,</v>

2013
01:28:42.901 --> 01:28:43.540
<v Speaker 3>so hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hold on.</v>

2014
01:28:43.690 --> 01:28:44.110
<v Speaker 3>Often</v>

2015
01:28:47.740 --> 01:28:52.740
<v Speaker 9>it's an absolute pleasure to be here in </v>
<v Speaker 9>the shade of an.</v>

2016
01:28:54.410 --> 01:28:59.410
<v Speaker 9>He would be laughing if it weren't for </v>
<v Speaker 9>the Patriots who answered the call of </v>

2017
01:29:01.130 --> 01:29:03.680
<v Speaker 9>freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 9>The aliens.</v>

2018
01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:09.220
<v Speaker 9>It would explode our every weakness and </v>
<v Speaker 9>suck the brains out of every living </v>

2019
01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:13.851
<v Speaker 9>soul.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They'd be laughing but not like you and </v>

2020
01:29:13.851 --> 01:29:13.851
<v Speaker 9>me.</v>
<v Speaker 9>They'd go,</v>

2021
01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:27.520
<v Speaker 3>this is making me dumb.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or just watch a five minute video.</v>

2022
01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:31.400
<v Speaker 3>That six minute video people really </v>
<v Speaker 3>upset about this.</v>

2023
01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:35.240
<v Speaker 3>It was on CNN.</v>

2024
01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:42.800
<v Speaker 11>Charlton Heston movies are no longer the</v>
<v Speaker 11>angels</v>

2025
01:29:50.580 --> 01:29:52.170
<v Speaker 3>masturbating with a gun in his hand</v>

2026
01:29:52.900 --> 01:29:57.900
<v Speaker 11>from his goal.</v>
<v Speaker 11>That takes a trigger.</v>

2027
01:30:05.140 --> 01:30:10.140
<v Speaker 3>We're watching mental illness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is madness that anybody put that </v>

2028
01:30:10.851 --> 01:30:12.380
<v Speaker 3>together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watched it and went.</v>

2029
01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:15.050
<v Speaker 3>I think it's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's let this out,</v>

2030
01:30:15.220 --> 01:30:20.220
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is your allergies really fucking you up </v>

2032
01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:20.220
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

2033
01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:24.010
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's like super extreme outside </v>

2034
01:30:24.010 --> 01:30:26.381
<v Speaker 3>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like for indoor allergens or dust and </v>

2035
01:30:26.381 --> 01:30:26.381
<v Speaker 3>dander.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have allergies.</v>

2036
01:30:26.381 --> 01:30:26.820
<v Speaker 3>Meaning that I'm lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2037
01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:28.330
<v Speaker 3>I'm lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2038
01:30:28.550 --> 01:30:33.550
<v Speaker 3>except a gluten intolerance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I've ever seen a thing </v>

2039
01:30:34.390 --> 01:30:37.370
<v Speaker 3>like watched a cartoon or something like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that and been offended.</v>

2040
01:30:37.371 --> 01:30:37.660
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

2041
01:30:37.661 --> 01:30:39.470
<v Speaker 3>What are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How can anybody be offended?</v>

2042
01:30:39.800 --> 01:30:44.800
<v Speaker 3>I'm offended that they stole three </v>
<v Speaker 3>minutes of my time watching Jim Carrey </v>

2043
01:30:44.800 --> 01:30:48.881
<v Speaker 3>to a guy that died 80 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My belief system isn't that shot that </v>

2044
01:30:48.881 --> 01:30:48.881
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2045
01:30:48.881 --> 01:30:50.630
<v Speaker 3>you're going to say something that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to throw me into a tizzy.</v>

2046
01:30:50.660 --> 01:30:51.380
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not only that,</v>

2047
01:30:51.381 --> 01:30:54.030
<v Speaker 3>but because there's a reaction to that </v>
<v Speaker 3>where you,</v>

2048
01:30:54.710 --> 01:30:55.070
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

2049
01:30:55.210 --> 01:30:57.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's obviously knowing that.</v>

2050
01:30:57.141 --> 01:30:58.760
<v Speaker 3>What he's doing is sort of </v>
<v Speaker 3>controversial,</v>

2051
01:30:59.060 --> 01:31:00.190
<v Speaker 3>so in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

2052
01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:01.190
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in that,</v>

2053
01:31:01.210 --> 01:31:04.580
<v Speaker 3>in sort of accepting that what he's </v>
<v Speaker 3>doing and what he's making fun of,</v>

2054
01:31:04.600 --> 01:31:08.630
<v Speaker 3>it's so mild because it's like the fact </v>
<v Speaker 3>that he's doing it at all because what's</v>

2055
01:31:08.631 --> 01:31:10.920
<v Speaker 3>supposed to be a controversial about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2056
01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:16.040
<v Speaker 3>he's always to mock Charlton Heston.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you've got like this artificial like </v>

2057
01:31:16.040 --> 01:31:17.870
<v Speaker 3>energy that you think is attached to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit,</v>

2058
01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:19.700
<v Speaker 3>but that's something tached to a bit for</v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

2059
01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:21.830
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it's not controversial to me.</v>

2060
01:31:22.070 --> 01:31:24.260
<v Speaker 3>It's not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I just kind of dumb like,</v>

2061
01:31:24.261 --> 01:31:26.030
<v Speaker 3>why are you even thinking about Charlton</v>
<v Speaker 3>Heston?</v>

2062
01:31:26.210 --> 01:31:29.060
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about a dead guy that </v>
<v Speaker 3>says something weird a long time ago.</v>

2063
01:31:29.260 --> 01:31:31.250
<v Speaker 3>Like if you were really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you really had something to say,</v>

2064
01:31:31.251 --> 01:31:33.320
<v Speaker 3>it should be a lot funnier than that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

2065
01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:34.340
<v Speaker 3>Like that's silly.</v>

2066
01:31:34.750 --> 01:31:36.860
<v Speaker 3>It's silly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's folly,</v>

2067
01:31:37.670 --> 01:31:41.410
<v Speaker 3>but you always wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a guy like Jim Carey who starts off</v>

2068
01:31:41.411 --> 01:31:43.850
<v Speaker 3>as career with that sort of ace Ventura </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

2069
01:31:43.851 --> 01:31:48.851
<v Speaker 3>We've just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or fire Marshall Bill number that </v>

2070
01:31:48.851 --> 01:31:49.200
<v Speaker 3>completely over the top hilarious shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2071
01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:51.100
<v Speaker 3>you can't do that when you're 60.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2072
01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:54.690
<v Speaker 3>Nobody wants to see Jerry Lewis was </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking fake Japanese teeth when he's 60</v>

2073
01:31:54.700 --> 01:31:55.940
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't want to see that.</v>

2074
01:31:56.090 --> 01:31:56.830
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2075
01:31:56.831 --> 01:32:00.970
<v Speaker 3>you don't mind it when he's 25 or 30.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of silly and Wacky,</v>

2076
01:32:01.330 --> 01:32:04.120
<v Speaker 3>but you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a transitionary period for those</v>

2077
01:32:04.121 --> 01:32:08.110
<v Speaker 3>types of comedians where it gets weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit gets weird when they're hitting 40,</v>

2078
01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:09.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Emo,</v>

2079
01:32:09.730 --> 01:32:12.130
<v Speaker 3>Philips,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like sort of sort of dropped that thing,</v>

2080
01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:17.460
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he will do a thing like this where he </v>

2081
01:32:17.460 --> 01:32:17.890
<v Speaker 3>would move all around the stage and </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk,</v>

2082
01:32:17.950 --> 01:32:19.500
<v Speaker 3>trying to crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It hurts my brain.</v>

2084
01:32:22.200 --> 01:32:23.740
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't do it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't do it anymore.</v>

2085
01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:26.840
<v Speaker 3>Now I now he does stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like you're,</v>

2086
01:32:26.841 --> 01:32:29.200
<v Speaker 3>you're in your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in a trap like the,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it ain't going to last.</v>

2090
01:32:33.041 --> 01:32:38.041
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You better learn how to reinvent </v>

2091
01:32:38.041 --> 01:32:38.041
<v Speaker 3>yourself right quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking hard.</v>

2093
01:32:41.851 --> 01:32:44.250

<v Speaker 3>I think he was held by that sort of </v>

2094
01:32:44.250 --> 01:32:45.310
<v Speaker 3>screaming,</v>

01:35:49.130 --> 01:35:51.020
<v Speaker 1>You can't really share with other people</v>
<v Speaker 1>as much,</v>

2173
01:35:51.021 --> 01:35:51.730
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2174
01:35:51.731 --> 01:35:53.420
<v Speaker 1>just the would be like that with </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

2175
01:35:53.540 --> 01:35:55.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it must be like that for brain surgeons,</v>

2176
01:35:55.850 --> 01:35:56.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine this,</v>

2177
01:35:56.540 --> 01:36:01.540
<v Speaker 1>be like some famous neurosurgeon and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a sudden you're on a flight with </v>

2178
01:36:01.540 --> 01:36:01.540
<v Speaker 1>another famous neurosurgeon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2179
01:36:01.540 --> 01:36:05.951
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well do you believe you've been using </v>

2180
01:36:05.951 --> 01:36:05.951
<v Speaker 1>for techniques and finding that stumps </v>
<v Speaker 1>blood clots,</v>

2181
01:36:05.951 --> 01:36:05.951
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's,</v>

2182
01:36:05.951 --> 01:36:08.270
<v Speaker 1>it seems like that would be the case </v>
<v Speaker 1>with everything,</v>

2183
01:36:08.690 --> 01:36:13.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just sort of massage she was talking </v>

2184
01:36:13.690 --> 01:36:13.690
<v Speaker 1>about that you find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2185
01:36:13.690 --> 01:36:15.320
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find what it is.</v>

2186
01:36:15.330 --> 01:36:16.070
<v Speaker 1>It's a language.</v>

2187
01:36:16.100 --> 01:36:16.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2188
01:36:17.060 --> 01:36:18.100
<v Speaker 1>it's a language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every.</v>

2189
01:36:18.110 --> 01:36:19.240
<v Speaker 1>Everything is the language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2190
01:36:19.241 --> 01:36:24.241
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get more and more fluent with </v>

2191
01:36:24.241 --> 01:36:24.241
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2192
01:36:24.241 --> 01:36:24.241
<v Speaker 1>think about what Jujitsu is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jujitsu,</v>

2193
01:36:24.241 --> 01:36:24.410
<v Speaker 1>language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man's physical language,</v>

2194
01:36:24.411 --> 01:36:27.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are answers to what,</v>

2195
01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:30.340
<v Speaker 1>what somebody gives to you and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2196
01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:32.720
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and somebody doesn't speak that language</v>

2197
01:36:32.721 --> 01:36:34.340
<v Speaker 1>is fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2198
01:36:34.460 --> 01:36:35.540
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is that way.</v>

2199
01:36:35.570 --> 01:36:40.570
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also part of that language is </v>

2200
01:36:40.570 --> 01:36:40.570
<v Speaker 1>rhythm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a rhythm,</v>

2201
01:36:40.570 --> 01:36:41.360
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a speed,</v>

2202
01:36:41.361 --> 01:36:44.840
<v Speaker 1>there's a tempo to everything that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>do and it varies on what you're doing,</v>

2203
01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:47.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's a and,</v>

2204
01:36:47.240 --> 01:36:52.240
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and your personality informs what that </v>

2205
01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:52.240
<v Speaker 1>rhythm is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2206
01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:55.301
<v Speaker 1>some guys when they do get to her </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking explosive and crazy and then </v>

2207
01:36:55.301 --> 01:36:56.180
<v Speaker 1>other guys are really passive and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>lock you up when they need to.</v>

2208
01:36:56.550 --> 01:37:00.560
<v Speaker 1>Just all depends on what your expression</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the thing it is you're doing,</v>

2209
01:37:00.561 --> 01:37:05.561
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can always feel and you can </v>

2210
01:37:05.561 --> 01:37:07.781
<v Speaker 1>always tell when someone is authentic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only because they last for a long </v>

2211
01:37:07.821 --> 01:37:09.290
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I really think human beings have.</v>

2212
01:37:09.290 --> 01:37:12.980
<v Speaker 1>You're keyed in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all have antenna for what's legit.</v>

2213
01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:16.250
<v Speaker 1>We all have like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like sensitive antenna for what's.</v>

2214
01:37:16.340 --> 01:37:18.500
<v Speaker 1>You can get fooled for a little while </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're young,</v>

2215
01:37:18.860 --> 01:37:21.000
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2216
01:37:21.560 --> 01:37:24.200
<v Speaker 1>I think we all have a sort of A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're lying to yourself,</v>

2217
01:37:24.201 --> 01:37:27.590
<v Speaker 1>you can get fooled fairly easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing with these scams.</v>

2218
01:37:27.990 --> 01:37:31.520
<v Speaker 1>Most people are aligned to themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people have to lie to themselves in</v>

2219
01:37:31.521 --> 01:37:34.910
<v Speaker 1>order to keep a job or a wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a husband or you know,</v>

2220
01:37:35.180 --> 01:37:35.780
<v Speaker 1>there's a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2221
01:37:35.781 --> 01:37:38.420
<v Speaker 1>it was a lot of people that have to kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of bullshit themselves,</v>

2222
01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:40.220
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

2223
01:37:41.090 --> 01:37:43.100
<v Speaker 1>it's not even that they have to bullshit</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

2224
01:37:43.130 --> 01:37:48.130
<v Speaker 1>It also could be that they got on a path</v>
<v Speaker 1>of bullshitting themselves at one point </v>

2225
01:37:48.130 --> 01:37:50.690
<v Speaker 1>in time to sort of access too thick and </v>
<v Speaker 1>too many responsibilities without though</v>

2226
01:37:50.691 --> 01:37:53.840
<v Speaker 1>they've moved on in their career.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're moving forward in life.</v>

2227
01:37:53.841 --> 01:37:56.050
<v Speaker 1>Like I knew a dude who was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he</v>

2228
01:37:56.050 --> 01:37:57.450
<v Speaker 4>had done movies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2229
01:37:57.480 --> 01:38:00.540
<v Speaker 4>but he was still full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like a movie star.</v>

2230
01:38:00.570 --> 01:38:05.570
<v Speaker 4>But he would lie to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He would lie to you about like fake </v>

2231
01:38:05.570 --> 01:38:08.511
<v Speaker 4>kickboxing matches that he had talked to</v>
<v Speaker 4>you about all these different things </v>

2232
01:38:08.511 --> 01:38:08.700
<v Speaker 4>that he was doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He definitely wasn't doing it.</v>

2233
01:38:08.720 --> 01:38:13.720
<v Speaker 4>He would just make shit up so he.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had still been connected to the all </v>

2234
01:38:13.720 --> 01:38:15.390
<v Speaker 4>this whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever negative thing that he had held</v>

2235
01:38:15.391 --> 01:38:20.391
<v Speaker 4>onto it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's still never realized how to let it </v>

2236
01:38:20.391 --> 01:38:21.150
<v Speaker 4>go while he was advancing and all these </v>
<v Speaker 4>other areas in his life.</v>

2237
01:38:21.450 --> 01:38:25.320
<v Speaker 4>So while he becoming a successful </v>
<v Speaker 4>millionaire movie star,</v>

2238
01:38:25.650 --> 01:38:28.170
<v Speaker 4>he was also still a liar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see that a lot.</v>

2239
01:38:28.870 --> 01:38:31.050
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know somebody who's got just this like</v>

2240
01:38:31.051 --> 01:38:34.500
<v Speaker 4>on paper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their life is so fucking amazing.</v>

2241
01:38:34.530 --> 01:38:37.830
<v Speaker 4>They're looking lots of money,</v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy,</v>

2242
01:38:37.831 --> 01:38:39.660
<v Speaker 4>nice house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>healthy,</v>

2243
01:38:39.930 --> 01:38:41.610
<v Speaker 4>great kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>successful,</v>

2244
01:38:41.611 --> 01:38:46.611
<v Speaker 4>and they are taking lots of anti </v>
<v Speaker 4>depressants just to get out of bed </v>

2245
01:38:46.611 --> 01:38:50.301
<v Speaker 4>because there's something fucking and </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not a chemical thing so much for </v>

2246
01:38:50.301 --> 01:38:50.301
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>

2247
01:38:50.301 --> 01:38:52.110
<v Speaker 4>It's just this malaise,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dissatisfaction,</v>

2248
01:38:52.140 --> 01:38:54.300
<v Speaker 4>anxiety.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're always suffering from.</v>

2249
01:38:54.510 --> 01:38:56.490
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's also an example,</v>

2250
01:38:56.510 --> 01:39:01.510
<v Speaker 4>an excellent example of that super </v>
<v Speaker 4>complicated machine being run by an </v>

2251
01:39:01.510 --> 01:39:06.171
<v Speaker 4>incompetent driver.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it's not an emotional or it's not a </v>

2252
01:39:06.171 --> 01:39:10.640
<v Speaker 4>chemical problem in your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it's not a disease or a disorder </v>

2253
01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:15.591
<v Speaker 4>that's giving you the wrong amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>hormones and it's some sort of a </v>

2254
01:39:15.591 --> 01:39:18.780
<v Speaker 4>behavioral issue that you've picked up </v>
<v Speaker 4>over the years and a pattern of you keep</v>

2255
01:39:18.781 --> 01:39:22.680
<v Speaker 4>repeating over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a sign of someone who was given a</v>

2256
01:39:22.681 --> 01:39:27.681
<v Speaker 4>very complicated thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>human life and didn't know how to fuck </v>

2257
01:39:27.681 --> 01:39:28.770
<v Speaker 4>to drive it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just slammed it into trees and fucked it</v>

2258
01:39:28.771 --> 01:39:31.530
<v Speaker 4>up and got hooked on meth and just went </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy with it.</v>

2259
01:39:31.531 --> 01:39:36.531
<v Speaker 4>Didn't know what it was doing right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Instead of someone who like who had </v>

2260
01:39:36.531 --> 01:39:39.801
<v Speaker 4>never lived in a physical form,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you ethereal and nature and the universe</v>

2261
01:39:40.051 --> 01:39:40.860
<v Speaker 4>gives you an opportunity.</v>

2262
01:39:40.860 --> 01:39:41.310
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>listen,</v>

01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:48.720
<v Speaker 4>we have a baby human available loving </v>
<v Speaker 4>household.</v>

2265
01:39:48.721 --> 01:39:53.721

<v Speaker 4>taking this baby human and developing </v>

2266
01:39:53.721 --> 01:39:58.000
<v Speaker 4>into a full form functional human being.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you've got an excellent support </v>

2267
01:39:58.000 --> 01:40:01.731

<v Speaker 4>but you're going to have to start from </v>

2268
01:40:01.731 --> 01:40:01.731
<v Speaker 4>scratch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

01:40:04.701 --> 01:40:08.631
<v Speaker 4>going to have to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People will teach you at first and then </v>

2271
01:40:08.631 --> 01:40:08.880
<v Speaker 4>you're gonna have to develop a voracious</v>
<v Speaker 4>appetite for knowledge.</v>

2272
01:40:09.090 --> 01:40:14.090
<v Speaker 4>All in all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to take about shit 30 years </v>

2273
01:40:14.090 --> 01:40:16.911
<v Speaker 4>before you even know how to fucking do </v>
<v Speaker 4>anything correctly or fit in with the </v>

2274
01:40:16.911 --> 01:40:18.270
<v Speaker 4>other people in your realm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but hey,</v>

2275
01:40:18.271 --> 01:40:20.550
<v Speaker 4>it's better than being gas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what do you want to do?</v>

2276
01:40:20.820 --> 01:40:23.100
<v Speaker 4>Do you want to be a spirit of the next </v>
<v Speaker 4>stage of afterlife,</v>

2277
01:40:24.690 --> 01:40:29.690
<v Speaker 4>fucking chance and ride a human flesh </v>
<v Speaker 4>machines to the brink of the end of </v>

2278
01:40:31.381 --> 01:40:32.610
<v Speaker 4>civilization.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Come on.</v>

2279
01:40:33.850 --> 01:40:34.990
<v Speaker 4>I liked that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

2280
01:40:35.340 --> 01:40:39.270
<v Speaker 4>that's a really cool theme to write a </v>
<v Speaker 4>story about.</v>

2281
01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:44.360
<v Speaker 4>You want to be gas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you want to ride this human flesh </v>

2282
01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:46.521
<v Speaker 4>machine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very possible that that's what </v>

2283
01:40:46.521 --> 01:40:46.521
<v Speaker 4>happened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2284
01:40:46.521 --> 01:40:47.550
<v Speaker 4>this idea of like the world being a </v>
<v Speaker 4>simulation.</v>

2285
01:40:47.810 --> 01:40:50.610
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's not a simulation in a sense </v>
<v Speaker 4>that maybe a session,</v>

2286
01:40:50.620 --> 01:40:54.520
<v Speaker 4>maybe the whole thing is fucking crazy </v>
<v Speaker 4>and blips</v>

2287
01:40:54.520 --> 01:40:59.520
<v Speaker 1>in and out of realities and maybe you </v>
<v Speaker 1>are some sort of gaseous sole form in </v>

2288
01:41:00.381 --> 01:41:05.381
<v Speaker 1>another dimension and then you live this</v>
<v Speaker 1>life as a person and then you pop out </v>

2289
01:41:05.381 --> 01:41:06.070
<v Speaker 1>the other side and and or some other </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that's so crazy.</v>

2290
01:41:06.071 --> 01:41:11.071
<v Speaker 1>You can't even imagine it right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's not in the realm of </v>

2291
01:41:11.071 --> 01:41:12.550
<v Speaker 1>experiences that a human can possibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience on this earth.</v>

2292
01:41:12.551 --> 01:41:16.840
<v Speaker 1>So much like having a crazy six grand </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushroom trip until you've done it.</v>

2293
01:41:16.841 --> 01:41:21.841
<v Speaker 1>You don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't even imagine what you're </v>

2294
01:41:21.841 --> 01:41:23.641
<v Speaker 1>talking about here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't imagine it and so when you </v>

2295
01:41:23.641 --> 01:41:23.641
<v Speaker 1>talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just talking nonsense.</v>

2296
01:41:23.641 --> 01:41:28.101
<v Speaker 1>You just making noises with your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when we leave this and move to the </v>

2297
01:41:28.101 --> 01:41:28.570
<v Speaker 1>next thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it is,</v>

2298
01:41:28.750 --> 01:41:33.750
<v Speaker 1>if there is such a reality and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible that the next thing will be so </v>

2299
01:41:33.750 --> 01:41:37.331
<v Speaker 1>fucking strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't even imagine like instead of </v>

2300
01:41:37.331 --> 01:41:40.210
<v Speaker 1>thinking about ourselves as this </v>
<v Speaker 1>disconnected a human being,</v>

2301
01:41:40.420 --> 01:41:43.360
<v Speaker 1>driving around in cars and using the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet,</v>

2302
01:41:43.660 --> 01:41:48.010
<v Speaker 1>the next thing could be no physical body</v>
<v Speaker 1>at all,</v>

2303
01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:53.240
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just constantly connected with a </v>

2304
01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:56.461
<v Speaker 1>tangible feeling of contact of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>entities and lifeforms and souls and </v>

2305
01:41:57.221 --> 01:41:57.620
<v Speaker 1>pattern.</v>

2306
01:41:57.620 --> 01:42:00.370
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like being part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Matrix as part of the Internet,</v>

2307
01:42:00.371 --> 01:42:00.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2308
01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:06.120
<v Speaker 1>if you think about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's certainly what I'm just </v>

2309
01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:09.331
<v Speaker 1>listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm listening to fucking all the </v>

2310
01:42:09.331 --> 01:42:09.331
<v Speaker 1>socrates and they says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2311
01:42:09.331 --> 01:42:09.331
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of in prison by this body,</v>

2312
01:42:09.430 --> 01:42:14.430
<v Speaker 1>this body that kind of breaks down this </v>
<v Speaker 1>body that distracts you constantly with </v>

2313
01:42:14.430 --> 01:42:15.520
<v Speaker 1>your appetites,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with food,</v>

2314
01:42:15.521 --> 01:42:16.900
<v Speaker 1>sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just pain,</v>

2315
01:42:16.901 --> 01:42:21.901
<v Speaker 1>sleep and all the things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it distracts you from the work at </v>

2316
01:42:21.901 --> 01:42:25.411
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real work that did this </v>

2317
01:42:25.411 --> 01:42:25.411
<v Speaker 1>contemplation on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

2318
01:42:25.411 --> 01:42:25.411
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth.</v>

2319
01:42:25.411 --> 01:42:27.880
<v Speaker 1>Getting to the truth of the essence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

2320
01:42:27.881 --> 01:42:28.130
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2321
01:42:28.660 --> 01:42:29.710
<v Speaker 1>and it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2322
01:42:29.711 --> 01:42:32.110
<v Speaker 1>if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea is he says,</v>

2323
01:42:32.111 --> 01:42:33.400
<v Speaker 1>he as he was dying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

2324
01:42:33.401 --> 01:42:33.820
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2325
01:42:33.821 --> 01:42:38.260
<v Speaker 1>I spent my whole life trying to separate</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself from this physical body,</v>

2326
01:42:38.261 --> 01:42:40.480
<v Speaker 1>like I treat all my appetite's with </v>
<v Speaker 1>quiet contempt.</v>

2327
01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:45.760
<v Speaker 1>And he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finally I get to be rid of this shit </v>

2328
01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:45.760
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just be a mind.</v>

2329
01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:46.900
<v Speaker 1>And he was like really looking forward </v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

2330
01:42:46.901 --> 01:42:51.901
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of profound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great statement that he treats </v>

2331
01:42:51.901 --> 01:42:53.350
<v Speaker 1>all of his appetites with content.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great sense,</v>

2332
01:42:53.351 --> 01:42:58.351
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so many intellectual sort of share </v>

2333
01:42:58.351 --> 01:42:58.510
<v Speaker 1>that they call it the hair loss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first journey,</v>

2334
01:42:58.511 --> 01:43:02.440
<v Speaker 1>your hunger or your sexuality or as it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a distraction.</v>

2335
01:43:02.441 --> 01:43:04.330
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be treated with quiet contempt</v>

2336
01:43:04.331 --> 01:43:07.720
<v Speaker 1>as you know it should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be treated as the last fucking</v>

2337
01:43:07.750 --> 01:43:10.690
<v Speaker 1>gasps of a fun life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

2338
01:43:10.700 --> 01:43:15.700
<v Speaker 1>We want to just sit around with no </v>
<v Speaker 1>boners on your couch reading a dumb </v>

2339
01:43:15.700 --> 01:43:19.471
<v Speaker 1>book.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the idea is actually getting to the </v>

2340
01:43:19.471 --> 01:43:19.471
<v Speaker 1>essence of the truth is more fun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2341
01:43:19.471 --> 01:43:20.650
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

2342
01:43:20.651 --> 01:43:21.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2343
01:43:21.220 --> 01:43:21.750
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2344
01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:24.400
<v Speaker 1>it's getting the essence of the truth is</v>
<v Speaker 1>more fun.</v>

2345
01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:29.400
<v Speaker 1>But ultimately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are to believe that this is a </v>

2346
01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:29.400
<v Speaker 1>temporary existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fruitless.</v>

2347
01:43:29.400 --> 01:43:29.950
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2348
01:43:29.951 --> 01:43:32.080
<v Speaker 1>that's what she'd been enjoying this </v>
<v Speaker 1>ride.</v>

2349
01:43:32.110 --> 01:43:34.390
<v Speaker 1>That was aristotle's rebuttal to </v>
<v Speaker 1>socrates.</v>

2350
01:43:34.391 --> 01:43:35.770
<v Speaker 1>Aristotle said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

2351
01:43:36.100 --> 01:43:41.100
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should try to strive to be just a </v>

2352
01:43:41.100 --> 01:43:41.100
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But by the way,</v>

2353
01:43:41.100 --> 01:43:43.981
<v Speaker 1>watch a woman give child birth and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me we're not physical fucking </v>

2354
01:43:43.981 --> 01:43:44.470
<v Speaker 1>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're physical beings with appetites and</v>

2355
01:43:44.471 --> 01:43:49.471
<v Speaker 1>you can get yourself to a point where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you feel really good physically and </v>

2356
01:43:49.471 --> 01:43:49.471
<v Speaker 1>mentally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why not do that?</v>

2357
01:43:49.471 --> 01:43:51.340
<v Speaker 1>You know what I always say when it comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>to socrates,</v>

2358
01:43:51.380 --> 01:43:52.310
<v Speaker 1>this is an important</v>

2359
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:55.230
<v Speaker 3>one to repeat whenever anybody says </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything about soccer too.</v>

2360
01:43:55.231 --> 01:43:56.930
<v Speaker 3>So you should always include.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2361
01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:59.000
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he fucked a lot of dudes.</v>

2362
01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:01.100
<v Speaker 3>He actually didn't invent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

2363
01:44:01.101 --> 01:44:06.101
<v Speaker 3>I love all his friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you fuck some boys soccer days </v>

2364
01:44:06.101 --> 01:44:09.190
<v Speaker 3>folks?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things that Credo always </v>

2365
01:44:09.190 --> 01:44:11.771
<v Speaker 3>complained about as he tried to seduce </v>
<v Speaker 3>them and citizen because he was married </v>

2366
01:44:11.771 --> 01:44:12.130
<v Speaker 3>with two kids and he could never do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do so.</v>

2367
01:44:12.170 --> 01:44:13.520
<v Speaker 3>No creative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to seduce them.</v>

2368
01:44:13.530 --> 01:44:14.930
<v Speaker 3>Socrates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>socrates,</v>

2369
01:44:15.410 --> 01:44:18.650
<v Speaker 3>they talk about that motherfucker stand </v>
<v Speaker 3>there during the war and he used to.</v>

2370
01:44:18.680 --> 01:44:20.330
<v Speaker 3>He could nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody.</v>

2371
01:44:20.331 --> 01:44:25.331
<v Speaker 3>They said with Dan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lack of sleep cold and lack of food </v>

2372
01:44:25.331 --> 01:44:29.681
<v Speaker 3>better than socrates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody can drink more wine and stay </v>

2373
01:44:29.681 --> 01:44:31.811
<v Speaker 3>sober.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And one day he stopped and he started </v>

2374
01:44:31.811 --> 01:44:34.541
<v Speaker 3>thinking and the soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>garlic shitty town of he's thinking and </v>

2375
01:44:34.541 --> 01:44:38.231
<v Speaker 3>they all sat there and watched him think</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they took bets on how long he'd </v>

2376
01:44:38.231 --> 01:44:38.231
<v Speaker 3>stand in one place.</v>

2377
01:44:38.231 --> 01:44:42.730
<v Speaker 3>And pretty soon the stan started to come</v>
<v Speaker 3>down and they pulled their fucking cops </v>

2378
01:44:42.730 --> 01:44:45.971
<v Speaker 3>out to watch him sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he stood there all fucking night </v>

2379
01:44:45.971 --> 01:44:47.750
<v Speaker 3>figuring out this problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The answer to an issue.</v>

2380
01:44:47.780 --> 01:44:49.070
<v Speaker 3>To me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meanwhile,</v>

2381
01:44:49.071 --> 01:44:52.280
<v Speaker 3>I bet that's a lie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bet that never happened.</v>

2382
01:44:52.281 --> 01:44:55.940
<v Speaker 3>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exaggerate the shit out of everything.</v>

2383
01:44:55.980 --> 01:44:58.300
<v Speaker 3>Remember talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>

2384
01:44:58.310 --> 01:45:03.310
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even know them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We did that about my talk when I'm </v>

2385
01:45:03.310 --> 01:45:03.310
<v Speaker 3>saying we all do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but our teacher's like,</v>

2386
01:45:03.310 --> 01:45:04.390
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your fight teacher.</v>

2387
01:45:04.391 --> 01:45:06.110
<v Speaker 3>The greatest,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know he can jump over trains.</v>

2388
01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:11.120
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What studies this Kung Fu with allows </v>

2389
01:45:11.120 --> 01:45:11.870
<v Speaker 3>them to kill Moose with his fucking bare</v>
<v Speaker 3>hands.</v>

2390
01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:13.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who knows my.</v>

2391
01:45:13.881 --> 01:45:15.620
<v Speaker 3>When you get to those kind of stories,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

2392
01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:17.510
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what really did happen?</v>

2393
01:45:17.540 --> 01:45:22.540
<v Speaker 3>Who is who is responsible for writing </v>
<v Speaker 3>down the actual events of the time and </v>

2394
01:45:22.560 --> 01:45:25.040
<v Speaker 3>it's funny because if you just go with </v>
<v Speaker 3>human nature,</v>

2395
01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:26.240
<v Speaker 3>we would always think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2396
01:45:26.241 --> 01:45:29.230
<v Speaker 3>what's wrong with a little elaboration?</v>

2397
01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:32.000
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to spice it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Good for the Romans.</v>

2398
01:45:32.001 --> 01:45:34.010
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did a great job.</v>

2399

<v Speaker 4>I thought it was.</v>

2450
01:47:23.580 --> 01:47:25.380
<v Speaker 4>They did it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They did a really good job.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Great music.</v>

2453
01:47:29.311 --> 01:47:30.870
<v Speaker 4>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is bullshit,</v>

<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Here's the thing.</v>

2457
01:47:42.301 --> 01:47:47.301
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is so wrong because it was a great </v>

2458
01:47:47.301 --> 01:47:47.430
<v Speaker 4>show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is a.</v>

2459
01:47:47.610 --> 01:47:49.170
<v Speaker 4>This is the only show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2460
01:47:49.171 --> 01:47:52.320
<v Speaker 4>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're like me and you have any,</v>

2461
01:47:53.250 --> 01:47:55.110
<v Speaker 4>if you eat meat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2462
01:47:55.200 --> 01:48:00.200
<v Speaker 4>and you have any desire for some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 4>intellectual connection to the animal </v>

2463
01:48:00.571 --> 01:48:05.571
<v Speaker 4>that cheat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's not a lot of people that </v>

2464
01:48:05.571 --> 01:48:05.571
<v Speaker 4>represent you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're a thinking person,</v>

2465
01:48:05.571 --> 01:48:07.230
<v Speaker 4>it's not a lot of people that represent </v>
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

2466
01:48:07.380 --> 01:48:12.380
<v Speaker 4>In the sportsman's world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have this idea that sportsmen and </v>

2467
01:48:12.380 --> 01:48:14.880
<v Speaker 4>hunters are this like these idiots,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these,</v>

2468
01:48:14.881 --> 01:48:19.881
<v Speaker 4>these fucking numb minded Republican </v>
<v Speaker 4>Republican robots and they're out there </v>

2469
01:48:22.381 --> 01:48:24.450
<v Speaker 4>just fucking shooting animals because </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're evil.</v>

2470
01:48:25.050 --> 01:48:27.720
<v Speaker 4>Watch this show because this is not that</v>
<v Speaker 4>at all.</v>

2471
01:48:27.721 --> 01:48:31.620
<v Speaker 4>This is Steve Rinella who's a good </v>
<v Speaker 4>friend now to Brian and myself.</v>

2472
01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:36.920
<v Speaker 4>He's an awesome guy and a really well </v>
<v Speaker 4>read individual with a deep knowledge of</v>

2473
01:48:37.441 --> 01:48:42.441
<v Speaker 4>especially the history of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>colonization of the West and and a deep </v>

2474
01:48:43.171 --> 01:48:48.171
<v Speaker 4>love for animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but deep love for animals and an </v>

2475
01:48:48.171 --> 01:48:50.751
<v Speaker 4>understanding of the whole process of </v>
<v Speaker 4>acquiring your own meat and the way he </v>

2476
01:48:51.781 --> 01:48:53.370
<v Speaker 4>does it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he does it through this idea.</v>

2477
01:48:53.370 --> 01:48:56.890
<v Speaker 4>It's called fair chase hunting where </v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not like,</v>

2478
01:48:56.910 --> 01:48:59.070
<v Speaker 4>sometimes they'll like setup and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 4>have a problem with this.</v>

2479
01:48:59.071 --> 01:49:01.350
<v Speaker 4>I'm just saying this is one of the ways </v>
<v Speaker 4>that people go hunting.</v>

2480
01:49:01.351 --> 01:49:06.351
<v Speaker 4>It makes it more effective.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you'll set out bait and the animal </v>

2481
01:49:06.351 --> 01:49:08.190
<v Speaker 4>will come to the food and then when it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the food you're hiding in a blind and</v>

2482
01:49:08.191 --> 01:49:11.420
<v Speaker 4>you shoot it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's like super calm after that.</v>

2483
01:49:11.790 --> 01:49:14.550
<v Speaker 4>That's Ted nugent's entire show by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

2484
01:49:14.551 --> 01:49:16.740
<v Speaker 4>I like Ted nugent and I liked Ted nugent</v>
<v Speaker 4>show.</v>

2485
01:49:16.830 --> 01:49:19.290
<v Speaker 4>I don't agree with them on a lot of his </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that he says,</v>

2486
01:49:19.291 --> 01:49:24.291
<v Speaker 4>especially when it comes to politics and</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a lot of nonsense and a lot of </v>

2487
01:49:24.291 --> 01:49:24.720
<v Speaker 4>his words.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think,</v>

2488
01:49:24.721 --> 01:49:29.721
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a fascinating character and he's </v>

2489
01:49:29.721 --> 01:49:29.790
<v Speaker 4>out there shooting animals and telling </v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody to go fuck themselves.</v>

2490
01:49:29.970 --> 01:49:34.970
<v Speaker 4>He shot a coyote in the head with a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>with an air rifle on the show and then </v>

2491
01:49:34.970 --> 01:49:35.370
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh look,</v>

2492
01:49:35.371 --> 01:49:39.330
<v Speaker 4>a great coyote threw it in the back of </v>
<v Speaker 4>his Ted fucking new children.</v>

2493
01:49:39.370 --> 01:49:40.740
<v Speaker 4>One with an air rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2494
01:49:40.741 --> 01:49:42.270
<v Speaker 4>Think about this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is not,</v>

2495
01:49:42.330 --> 01:49:47.330
<v Speaker 4>I mean this is like he's a big rock star</v>
<v Speaker 4>and at one point in time when I was a </v>

2496
01:49:47.330 --> 01:49:48.070
<v Speaker 4>kid,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ted nugent was fucking huge.</v>

2497
01:49:48.150 --> 01:49:53.150
<v Speaker 4>Lot of cons to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>stranglehold is one of my all time </v>

2498
01:49:53.710 --> 01:49:57.190
<v Speaker 4>favorite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Classic rock hits the live version.</v>

2499
01:49:57.340 --> 01:50:02.140
<v Speaker 4>You got me in that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>God Damn Amazing.</v>

2500
01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:03.190
<v Speaker 4>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's crazy though,</v>

2501
01:50:03.191 --> 01:50:06.280
<v Speaker 4>but I like them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know I don't like me.</v>

2502
01:50:06.350 --> 01:50:07.540
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't like everything about them.</v>

2503
01:50:07.541 --> 01:50:12.541
<v Speaker 4>I don't like them all across the board,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but Steve Rinella represents a </v>

2504
01:50:12.541 --> 01:50:16.051
<v Speaker 4>completely different time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not Ted nugent's leaving bait out </v>

2505
01:50:16.051 --> 01:50:20.110
<v Speaker 4>and he shoot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He shot three deer with a bow and Arrow </v>

2506
01:50:20.110 --> 01:50:21.040
<v Speaker 4>in the first 15 minutes of just show the</v>
<v Speaker 4>other day.</v>

2507
01:50:22.190 --> 01:50:23.320
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even know.</v>

2508
01:50:23.510 --> 01:50:25.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean how many they let you eat that </v>
<v Speaker 4>much.</v>

2509

01:50:31.561 --> 01:50:33.550
<v Speaker 4>they know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They know animal goes to waste.</v>

2515
01:50:33.660 --> 01:50:35.890
<v Speaker 4>They mean he has a guy that butchers and</v>
<v Speaker 4>shit.</v>

2516
01:50:35.891 --> 01:50:40.891
<v Speaker 4>He's shown it on the show before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not mean Ted nugent not doing </v>

2517
01:50:40.891 --> 01:50:41.140
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's definitely given a lot of food way.</v>

2518
01:50:41.380 --> 01:50:42.850
<v Speaker 4>He just likes doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2519
01:50:42.851 --> 01:50:44.930
<v Speaker 4>and whatever man the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2520
01:50:44.970 --> 01:50:46.420
<v Speaker 4>what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why is that bad?</v>

2521
01:50:46.570 --> 01:50:49.790
<v Speaker 4>But the guy who runs this dairy farm or </v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2522
01:50:49.791 --> 01:50:52.120
<v Speaker 4>a slaughter and steers to make your </v>
<v Speaker 4>cheeseburger,</v>

2523
01:50:52.420 --> 01:50:53.700
<v Speaker 4>that guy is acceptable,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2524
01:50:53.780 --> 01:50:56.020
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that doesn't make any sense the way he's</v>

2525
01:50:56.021 --> 01:51:01.021
<v Speaker 4>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even the way Ted nugent doing it by </v>

2526
01:51:01.021 --> 01:51:01.021
<v Speaker 4>leaving out bait and shooting it with an</v>
<v Speaker 4>Arrow when it comes to eat.</v>

2527
01:51:01.021 --> 01:51:03.940
<v Speaker 4>So fucking what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's still way more ethical.</v>

2528
01:51:03.941 --> 01:51:05.050
<v Speaker 4>Way Smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2529
01:51:05.051 --> 01:51:06.100
<v Speaker 4>why wouldn't you do that?</v>

2530
01:51:06.100 --> 01:51:11.100
<v Speaker 4>Don't you have some extra corn?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you want to traipse around the </v>

2531
01:51:11.100 --> 01:51:11.590
<v Speaker 4>fucking forest looking for some animal?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just leave the corn out.</v>

2532
01:51:11.591 --> 01:51:12.220
<v Speaker 4>Shoot it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2533
01:51:12.221 --> 01:51:17.221
<v Speaker 4>what's the goal?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The goal is you have to shoot it until </v>

2534
01:51:17.221 --> 01:51:17.221
<v Speaker 4>you've been out there at five in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>morning,</v>

2535
01:51:17.221 --> 01:51:18.640
<v Speaker 4>freezing your dick off after sleeping in</v>
<v Speaker 4>a tent.</v>

2536
01:51:19.270 --> 01:51:22.540
<v Speaker 4>You fucking use bait right quick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially if you're a hungry man.</v>

2537
01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:24.190
<v Speaker 4>This guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Steve Rinella,</v>

2538
01:51:24.191 --> 01:51:27.760
<v Speaker 4>though he doesn't do any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His is all fair chase hunting and he's a</v>

2539
01:51:27.761 --> 01:51:32.761
<v Speaker 4>really bright guy and we have this </v>
<v Speaker 4>really ignorant stereotype that people </v>

2540
01:51:34.121 --> 01:51:37.750
<v Speaker 4>that grew up in sort of hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fishing backgrounds are dummies.</v>

2541
01:51:38.020 --> 01:51:39.070
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people do,</v>

2542
01:51:39.130 --> 01:51:41.890
<v Speaker 4>a lot of people who don't have any </v>
<v Speaker 4>experience in hunting.</v>

2543
01:51:42.280 --> 01:51:47.280
<v Speaker 4>And I think the beautiful thing about </v>
<v Speaker 4>this show is you guys are fucking great </v>

2544
01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:47.280

2546
01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:49.480
<v Speaker 4>His book,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very good book.</v>

2547

<v Speaker 4>he's just descriptions or captivate you.</v>

2548
01:51:54.040 --> 01:51:57.490
<v Speaker 4>Like he's got a really intelligent way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I learned a lot from.</v>

2549
01:51:57.800 --> 01:51:59.540
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So uh,</v>

2550
01:52:01.060 --> 01:52:04.170
<v Speaker 4>my parents about the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunting in a blind or,</v>

2551
01:52:04.171 --> 01:52:05.800
<v Speaker 4>or fair chase hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2552
01:52:05.801 --> 01:52:07.450
<v Speaker 4>But I was talking about something before</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2553
01:52:07.470 --> 01:52:12.470
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember what the hell it was </v>

2554
01:52:12.470 --> 01:52:12.470

<v Speaker 4>a tangent son hit.</v>

2555
01:52:12.470 --> 01:52:17.400
<v Speaker 4>But the people that have a problem with </v>
<v Speaker 4>basically anything that people do </v>

2556
01:52:17.590 --> 01:52:20.020
<v Speaker 4>because people that have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about all the restaurants?</v>

2557
01:52:20.021 --> 01:52:21.460
<v Speaker 4>Everywhere you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're serving me.</v>

2558
01:52:21.490 --> 01:52:26.490
<v Speaker 4>Like why are you freaking out about </v>
<v Speaker 4>certain specific situations where you </v>

2559
01:52:26.490 --> 01:52:26.760
<v Speaker 4>find meat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>and why is it really meet because are,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what are these animals?</v>

2561
01:52:29.681 --> 01:52:30.700
<v Speaker 4>Can they do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you don't eat them,</v>

2562
01:52:30.710 --> 01:52:33.390
<v Speaker 4>are they just going to live forever or </v>
<v Speaker 4>if they're not gonna live forever,</v>

2563
01:52:33.391 --> 01:52:35.350
<v Speaker 4>they going to live a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 4>time and then what happens to the meat?</v>

2564
01:52:35.380 --> 01:52:37.720
<v Speaker 4>Is it okay to feed it to dogs once they </v>
<v Speaker 4>die of old age?</v>

2565
01:52:37.721 --> 01:52:38.860
<v Speaker 4>Is that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that allowed?</v>

2566
01:52:39.190 --> 01:52:39.720
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what?</v>

2567
01:52:39.721 --> 01:52:41.950
<v Speaker 4>What do we do as humans to control the </v>
<v Speaker 4>population?</v>

2568
01:52:41.980 --> 01:52:44.320
<v Speaker 4>We have spent a lot of money on </v>
<v Speaker 4>sterilization programs.</v>

2569
01:52:44.480 --> 01:52:46.040
<v Speaker 4>What if our health deteriorates because </v>
<v Speaker 4>we're</v>

2570
01:52:46.040 --> 01:52:51.040

<v Speaker 3>You've never seen fucking that guy would</v>

2627
01:55:19.281 --> 01:55:21.950
<v Speaker 3>show up when chuck Liddell was the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking champion in the UFC,</v>

2628
01:55:22.150 --> 01:55:24.890
<v Speaker 3>the UFC light heavyweight champion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he wouldn't walk into a club.</v>

2629
01:55:25.310 --> 01:55:28.860
<v Speaker 3>He W,</v>
<v Speaker 3>w you've never seen gravity like daily.</v>

2630
01:55:29.060 --> 01:55:33.370
<v Speaker 3>He would suck in hot titted asteroids.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boom.</v>

2631
01:55:33.470 --> 01:55:36.830
<v Speaker 3>He was like Jupiter absorbing grit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were just hugging him,</v>

2632
01:55:36.831 --> 01:55:39.110
<v Speaker 3>wanting to take pictures with him and </v>
<v Speaker 3>hugging him,</v>

2633
01:55:39.111 --> 01:55:40.620
<v Speaker 3>want to take pictures with them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>

2634
01:55:40.650 --> 01:55:41.840
<v Speaker 3>It was a swarm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

2635
01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:45.330
<v Speaker 3>have you seen that commercial for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>World War z while the Zombie swarm?</v>

2636
01:55:45.540 --> 01:55:46.740
<v Speaker 3>That's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When chocolate,</v>

2637
01:55:46.741 --> 01:55:48.390
<v Speaker 3>Dell would show up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>girls would just flock to him.</v>

2638
01:55:48.420 --> 01:55:49.350
<v Speaker 3>He's the gladiator.</v>

2639
01:55:49.500 --> 01:55:54.500
<v Speaker 3>They couldn't help the Alpha male he </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to meet and they wanted to talk </v>

2640
01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:54.500
<v Speaker 3>to him and the guy like literally </v>
<v Speaker 3>couldn't move through the room.</v>

2641
01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:59.350
<v Speaker 3>I've never seen anything like it hung </v>
<v Speaker 3>with Mike Tyson and they say the same </v>

2642
01:55:59.350 --> 01:55:59.640
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No idea.</v>

2643
01:55:59.641 --> 01:56:02.760
<v Speaker 3>Especially because in Vegas a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those girls are drunk.</v>

2644
01:56:03.330 --> 01:56:08.330
<v Speaker 3>When you're drunk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's when the real thoughts come out </v>

2645
01:56:08.330 --> 01:56:11.320
<v Speaker 3>and you're like a picture with my DNA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your DNA takes out.</v>

2646
01:56:11.490 --> 01:56:12.240
<v Speaker 3>Give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna.</v>

2647

<v Speaker 3>That's my thing.</v>

2649
01:56:15.240 --> 01:56:16.830
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It should go.</v>

2650
01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:18.780
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no girl would support that.</v>

2651
01:56:18.781 --> 01:56:21.480
<v Speaker 3>It's like you fucking whore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They might need them to,</v>

2652
01:56:21.510 --> 01:56:22.830
<v Speaker 3>but I don't want you to suck his Dick </v>
<v Speaker 3>First.</v>

2653
01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:23.610
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

2654
01:56:25.750 --> 01:56:28.760
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He and in his,</v>

2655
01:56:28.960 --> 01:56:30.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his one man show,</v>

2656
01:56:30.540 --> 01:56:32.510
<v Speaker 3>he starts by saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2657
01:56:32.810 --> 01:56:34.780
<v Speaker 3>if you with those coco cafe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's,</v>

2658
01:56:34.980 --> 01:56:37.440
<v Speaker 3>let me get one of those two buddy in his</v>
<v Speaker 3>one man show.</v>

2659
01:56:37.441 --> 01:56:42.441
<v Speaker 3>He basically says he puts up the number.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see it basically puts up the </v>

2660
01:56:42.441 --> 01:56:42.441
<v Speaker 3>number 400 million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

2661
01:56:42.441 --> 01:56:45.110
<v Speaker 3>I lost all that money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my gosh,</v>

2662
01:56:45.160 --> 01:56:50.160
<v Speaker 3>Dale,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made 400 million and I lost 400 </v>

2663
01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:50.160
<v Speaker 3>million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No Shit.</v>

2664
01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:50.400
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that's what happens.</v>

2665
01:56:50.420 --> 01:56:53.340
<v Speaker 3>You just buy a bunch of tigers and just </v>
<v Speaker 3>like fucking everything.</v>

2666
01:56:53.690 --> 01:56:58.690
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's also the kind of mentality that </v>

2667
01:56:58.690 --> 01:57:00.980
<v Speaker 3>allows you to become a prize fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that kind of mentality that allows you </v>

2668
01:57:00.980 --> 01:57:05.121
<v Speaker 3>to be a person who risks his health and </v>
<v Speaker 3>runs at men in a,</v>

2669
01:57:06.491 --> 01:57:08.950
<v Speaker 3>in a boxing ring and smashes that </v>
<v Speaker 3>brands,</v>

2670
01:57:09.190 --> 01:57:10.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're thinking about the moment,</v>

2671
01:57:10.981 --> 01:57:15.981
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're thinking about training for your </v>

2672
01:57:15.981 --> 01:57:15.981
<v Speaker 3>next fight.</v>

2673
01:57:15.981 --> 01:57:15.981
<v Speaker 3>You thinking about months of </v>
<v Speaker 3>preparation,</v>

2674
01:57:15.981 --> 01:57:17.550
<v Speaker 3>you thinking about the fight itself.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You probably also have to be a little,</v>

2675
01:57:17.610 --> 01:57:19.740
<v Speaker 3>like you have to be pretty aggro,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2676
01:57:20.430 --> 01:57:25.430
<v Speaker 3>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it's also like someone telling you </v>

2677
01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:25.430
<v Speaker 3>what you can and can't do with your </v>
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>

2678
01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:25.430
<v Speaker 3>But like bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Hector Camacho.</v>

2679
01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:30.111
<v Speaker 3>I'll do whatever the fuck I want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get my trio man in </v>

2680
01:57:30.111 --> 01:57:30.111
<v Speaker 3>diamonds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Suck my Dick.</v>

2681
01:57:30.111 --> 01:57:30.111
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Alright.</v>

2682
01:57:30.111 --> 01:57:31.830
<v Speaker 3>So it's going to say macho man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>suck my Dick.</v>

2683
01:57:32.930 --> 01:57:35.880
<v Speaker 3>You get whatever you want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean if you're a champion,</v>

2684
01:57:35.881 --> 01:57:40.881
<v Speaker 3>it's almost like you have to have that </v>
<v Speaker 3>mentality to be that Mike Tyson type of </v>

2685
01:57:40.881 --> 01:57:41.130
<v Speaker 3>a character.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2686
01:57:41.131 --> 01:57:43.230
<v Speaker 3>Bernard Hopkins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like famously frugal,</v>

2687
01:57:43.440 --> 01:57:44.400
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he uh,</v>

2688
01:57:44.460 --> 01:57:49.460
<v Speaker 3>he's just a smart disciplined guy that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>still at 48 years old world boxing </v>

2689
01:57:49.460 --> 01:57:51.180
<v Speaker 3>champion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The craziest thing I've ever.</v>

2690
01:57:51.181 --> 01:57:56.181
<v Speaker 3>No one's ever done that before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's ever done at 48 years old and </v>

2691
01:57:56.181 --> 01:57:56.181
<v Speaker 3>look fucking good.</v>

2692
01:57:56.181 --> 01:57:57.330
<v Speaker 3>He looked great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He box the shit out of that dude.</v>

2693
01:57:57.331 --> 01:57:59.170
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it wasn't a close to crazy.</v>

2694
01:58:00.150 --> 01:58:01.890
<v Speaker 3>He's a master.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's a master.</v>

2695
01:58:01.950 --> 01:58:05.700
<v Speaker 3>He's a master boxer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's like Super Frugal,</v>

2696
01:58:05.850 --> 01:58:08.160
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>But his style is like super frugal.</v>

2697
01:58:08.161 --> 01:58:10.320
<v Speaker 3>That's why at 48 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's still in the mix.</v>

2698
01:58:10.650 --> 01:58:12.140
<v Speaker 3>Whereas a guy like Mike Tyson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when she says,</v>

2699
01:58:13.030 --> 01:58:18.030
<v Speaker 3>and he fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he raged for a few years and then done </v>

2700
01:58:18.030 --> 01:58:20.220
<v Speaker 3>Mike Tyson and Bernard Hopkins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they were boxing at the same time.</v>

2701
01:58:20.640 --> 01:58:22.750
<v Speaker 3>You know Bernard Hopkins is older.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2702
01:58:23.040 --> 01:58:25.620
<v Speaker 3>Bernard Hopkins is the older man and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they were bought in.</v>

2703
01:58:25.621 --> 01:58:28.500
<v Speaker 3>Bernard Hopkins is still a world </v>
<v Speaker 3>champion,</v>

2704
01:58:28.650 --> 01:58:32.830
<v Speaker 3>still speaks fluent is no voice </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems.</v>

2705
01:58:32.850 --> 01:58:35.450
<v Speaker 3>So articulate so articulately,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does not get hit very well.</v>

2706
01:58:35.790 --> 01:58:37.740
<v Speaker 3>Knows how to roll with things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's never been hurt.</v>

2707
01:58:37.950 --> 01:58:39.630
<v Speaker 3>Never been hurt even when he's been </v>
<v Speaker 3>tagged.</v>

2708
01:58:39.631 --> 01:58:41.320
<v Speaker 3>But he's been tagged by guys in drop </v>
<v Speaker 3>them,</v>

2709
01:58:41.680 --> 01:58:41.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2710
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:45.010
<v Speaker 4>he just starts boxing and he's </v>
<v Speaker 4>disciplined is fuck.</v>

2711
01:58:45.011 --> 01:58:47.920
<v Speaker 4>And he sticks that fucking boxing game </v>
<v Speaker 4>in your face.</v>

2712
01:58:48.010 --> 01:58:52.270
<v Speaker 4>And slowly but surely he starts to </v>
<v Speaker 4>overwhelm when he beat Kelly pavlick and</v>

2713
01:58:52.271 --> 01:58:54.250
<v Speaker 4>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he grabbed him apparently,</v>

2714
01:58:54.251 --> 01:58:55.720
<v Speaker 4>and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't let this ruin you.</v>

2715
01:58:56.270 --> 01:58:57.700
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he uh,</v>

2716
01:58:57.970 --> 01:59:00.580
<v Speaker 4>he knew he was going to be the money </v>
<v Speaker 4>walk in the ring to be that good.</v>

2717
01:59:00.581 --> 01:59:02.940
<v Speaker 4>Kelly Pavlich was a fucking killer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a,</v>

2718
01:59:03.170 --> 01:59:08.170
<v Speaker 4>that's an exceptional fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the defining fight was Felix </v>

2719
01:59:08.440 --> 01:59:10.870
<v Speaker 4>Trinidad because Felix Trinidad was </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought to be a destroyer.</v>

2720
01:59:10.990 --> 01:59:15.990
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people were setting up Felix Trinidad </v>

2721
01:59:15.990 --> 01:59:15.990
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

2722
01:59:15.990 --> 01:59:15.990
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fight all these super fights.</v>

2723
01:59:15.990 --> 01:59:18.040
<v Speaker 4>Wasn't going to fight Oscar de la Hoya,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's gonna fight like a lot of different</v>

2724
01:59:18.041 --> 01:59:23.041
<v Speaker 4>people at Felix Trinidad was a killer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a serious high level dangerous </v>

2725
01:59:23.041 --> 01:59:27.061
<v Speaker 4>threat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Bernard Hopkins blocked his fucking </v>

2726
01:59:27.061 --> 01:59:30.720
<v Speaker 4>face off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just boxed his fucking ears off </v>

2727
01:59:30.720 --> 01:59:31.570
<v Speaker 4>credible and,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and just shut them down.</v>

2728
01:59:31.570 --> 01:59:34.450
<v Speaker 4>And it was amazing that people thought </v>
<v Speaker 4>the Trinidad was the favorite going into</v>

2729
01:59:34.451 --> 01:59:38.530
<v Speaker 4>that fight because Bernard Hopkins </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking dominated him.</v>

2730
01:59:38.620 --> 01:59:43.620
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he dominated him and he stopped him and </v>

2731
01:59:43.620 --> 01:59:46.880
<v Speaker 4>it ended Felix Trinidad feel extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was never the same after that </v>

2732
01:59:46.880 --> 01:59:46.880
<v Speaker 4>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was.</v>

2733
01:59:46.880 --> 01:59:47.620
<v Speaker 4>That was the fight where he hit the </v>
<v Speaker 4>wall.</v>

2734
01:59:47.770 --> 01:59:52.770
<v Speaker 4>They say for fighters always have one </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight that like even get hit one time by</v>

2735
01:59:52.961 --> 01:59:54.400
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one punch.</v>

2736
01:59:54.401 --> 01:59:59.401
<v Speaker 4>Usually that changes that whole mix.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well you can say like GSP was not the </v>

2737
02:00:00.521 --> 02:00:05.521
<v Speaker 4>same fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He became very conservative and careful </v>

2738
02:00:05.521 --> 02:00:08.401
<v Speaker 4>after he got knocked out by Matt Serra,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well he definitely became more </v>

2739
02:00:08.401 --> 02:00:11.290
<v Speaker 4>conservative but controls you rather </v>
<v Speaker 4>than GSP,</v>

2740
02:00:11.530 --> 02:00:12.820
<v Speaker 4>which you've got to look out and people </v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

2741
02:00:13.060 --> 02:00:13.730
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2742
02:00:13.731 --> 02:00:18.430
<v Speaker 4>this is gsp slowing down or is GSP.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was GSP that and you know,</v>

2743
02:00:18.431 --> 02:00:20.680
<v Speaker 4>is this time over or new guy's going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>beat them.</v>

2744
02:00:20.830 --> 02:00:23.050
<v Speaker 4>There's always going to be a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking killers out there.</v>

2745
02:00:23.051 --> 02:00:24.220
<v Speaker 4>There's always going to be a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>scary.</v>

2746
02:00:24.490 --> 02:00:29.490
<v Speaker 4>Johny Hendricks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jake ellenberger type dudes looking to </v>

2747
02:00:29.490 --> 02:00:32.501
<v Speaker 4>smash your fucking face and when you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>the champ there's no getting around </v>

2748
02:00:32.501 --> 02:00:35.221
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's most impressive is that the guy </v>

2749
02:00:35.221 --> 02:00:38.320
<v Speaker 4>has been doing this for so fucking long </v>
<v Speaker 4>and when shit starts happening,</v>

2750
02:00:38.560 --> 02:00:41.320
<v Speaker 4>like he blew out his acl,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look getting injured,</v>

2751
02:00:41.470 --> 02:00:43.990
<v Speaker 4>that is a normal part of being an </v>
<v Speaker 4>athlete.</v>

2752
02:00:44.020 --> 02:00:45.760
<v Speaker 4>It happens.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no getting around it.</v>

2753
02:00:46.030 --> 02:00:50.080
<v Speaker 4>You're putting your body through </v>
<v Speaker 4>incredible strains and you're especially</v>

2754
02:00:50.081 --> 02:00:55.081
<v Speaker 4>doing an improvisational sort of a thing</v>
<v Speaker 4>like wrestling or Jujitsu or kickboxing </v>

2755
02:00:55.081 --> 02:00:58.651
<v Speaker 4>where you you don't know how he's gonna </v>
<v Speaker 4>move or you're going to be expiring and </v>

2756
02:00:58.651 --> 02:00:59.360
<v Speaker 4>Shit goes wrong and you can get hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no doubt.</v>

2757
02:00:59.380 --> 02:01:04.380
<v Speaker 4>There's no way of avoiding that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when shit starts breaking and you </v>

2758
02:01:04.380 --> 02:01:09.241
<v Speaker 4>start getting injured and you start </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking about the amount of hours this </v>

2759
02:01:09.241 --> 02:01:12.510
<v Speaker 4>guys put in the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the amount of hours guys put in the </v>

2760
02:01:12.510 --> 02:01:12.510
<v Speaker 4>cage,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he amount of fights,</v>

2761
02:01:12.510 --> 02:01:12.700
<v Speaker 4>amount of wear and tear.</v>

2762
02:01:12.850 --> 02:01:17.850
<v Speaker 4>It's just a matter of how long can you </v>
<v Speaker 4>consistently keep up that sort of </v>

2763
02:01:17.850 --> 02:01:20.730
<v Speaker 4>fighting intensity and all wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 4>based fighting style too,</v>

2764
02:01:21.500 --> 02:01:24.070
<v Speaker 4>which is very taxing on your spinal </v>
<v Speaker 4>cord,</v>

2765
02:01:24.071 --> 02:01:29.071
<v Speaker 4>very taxing on your knees.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know there's a lot of power in </v>

2766
02:01:29.071 --> 02:01:32.700
<v Speaker 4>involved in a wrestling base style.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if you're a technical guy like a </v>

2767
02:01:32.700 --> 02:01:36.541
<v Speaker 4>Ben Aspirin,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like it becomes a difficult style </v>

2768
02:01:36.541 --> 02:01:37.840
<v Speaker 4>to to incorporate what's of about him </v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

2769
02:01:37.841 --> 02:01:41.240
<v Speaker 4>It's gsps his ability and also there's a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of tape on them.</v>

2770
02:01:41.241 --> 02:01:42.830
<v Speaker 4>You can watch a lot on him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can like.</v>

2771
02:01:42.860 --> 02:01:47.860
<v Speaker 4>You can try to figure him out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he fights a different fight in some </v>

2772
02:01:47.860 --> 02:01:48.060
<v Speaker 4>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every time he fights as well.</v>

2773
02:01:48.061 --> 02:01:48.640
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

2774
02:01:48.740 --> 02:01:50.210
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't get me wrong.</v>

2775
02:01:50.211 --> 02:01:55.211
<v Speaker 4>I think like a wrestling based style is </v>
<v Speaker 4>definitely the best way to approach it </v>

2776
02:01:56.420 --> 02:02:01.420
<v Speaker 4>as far as longevity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but even that it's like how much </v>

2777
02:02:01.420 --> 02:02:01.460
<v Speaker 4>longevity can.</v>

2778
02:02:01.640 --> 02:02:06.560
<v Speaker 4>MMA is a brutal Goddamn game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How much longevity can you get a certain</v>

2779
02:02:06.561 --> 02:02:11.561
<v Speaker 4>point in time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone's going to come along and if </v>

2780
02:02:11.561 --> 02:02:11.561
<v Speaker 4>Anderson Silva keeps fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone's probably going to beat him.</v>

2781
02:02:11.561 --> 02:02:16.420
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it might be sort of a Bernard </v>

2782
02:02:16.420 --> 02:02:16.420
<v Speaker 4>Hopkins situation where no one ever </v>
<v Speaker 4>gets.</v>

2783
02:02:16.420 --> 02:02:20.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's so clever and so technical that no </v>

2784
02:02:20.250 --> 02:02:20.250
<v Speaker 4>one ever gets to the point where they </v>
<v Speaker 4>can really humiliate them,</v>

2785
02:02:20.250 --> 02:02:24.910
<v Speaker 4>but there'll be a guy like a chat dawson</v>
<v Speaker 4>who come along and beat Bernard Hopkins </v>

2786
02:02:24.910 --> 02:02:25.430
<v Speaker 4>because he was younger and quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2787
02:02:25.550 --> 02:02:27.560
<v Speaker 4>there's going to be these Andre Ward </v>
<v Speaker 4>type.</v>

2788
02:02:27.561 --> 02:02:31.580
<v Speaker 4>Gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be the dude that,</v>

2789
02:02:31.581 --> 02:02:32.600

<v Speaker 4>I want to say Jermaine,</v>

2791
02:02:36.291 --> 02:02:37.360

2792
02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:39.650
<v Speaker 4>his name.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So a lot of his fights.</v>

2793
02:02:40.730 --> 02:02:45.730
<v Speaker 4>He was the champ and he beat 'em.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that's the right box or </v>

2794
02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:49.860
<v Speaker 4>African.</v>

2805
02:03:09.431 --> 02:03:14.431
<v Speaker 4>a kickboxing champion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm Jermaine Stewart.</v>

2806
02:03:14.730 --> 02:03:17.380
<v Speaker 4>Jimmy Taylor.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2808
02:03:18.760 --> 02:03:19.720
<v Speaker 4>Andrea says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sorry.</v>

2809
02:03:20.140 --> 02:03:23.620
<v Speaker 4>Bad ass looking dude was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw the one tail.</v>

2810
02:03:23.621 --> 02:03:26.320
<v Speaker 4>It's got a shaved head and the crazy </v>
<v Speaker 4>ponytail he fought in the UFC,</v>

2811
02:03:26.321 --> 02:03:27.250
<v Speaker 4>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pretty sure.</v>

2812
02:03:27.820 --> 02:03:29.050
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but uh,</v>

2813
02:03:29.110 --> 02:03:34.110
<v Speaker 4>he beat Kelly pavlock knocked him out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he beat Bernard Hopkins twice and he</v>

2814
02:03:34.421 --> 02:03:36.370
<v Speaker 4>beat him with speed plead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He beat him twice.</v>

2815
02:03:37.250 --> 02:03:40.410
<v Speaker 4>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a bigger guy and he's but pablet.</v>

2816
02:03:40.420 --> 02:03:44.080
<v Speaker 4>Meanwhile pavlock beat him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he was just able to out athlete.</v>

2817
02:03:44.380 --> 02:03:47.100
<v Speaker 4>It's so funny looking at Kylie look like</v>
<v Speaker 4>he like this.</v>

2818
02:03:47.310 --> 02:03:50.440
<v Speaker 4>If you saw him on the beach and shorts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he couldn't look more normal.</v>

2819
02:03:50.441 --> 02:03:55.100
<v Speaker 4>There's not a lot of muscle tone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's covered with some kind of.</v>

2820
02:03:55.240 --> 02:03:57.880
<v Speaker 4>After he had his kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He had a bit of a breakdown.</v>

2821
02:03:57.881 --> 02:04:00.580
<v Speaker 4>Then he went and got about sat too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of alcohol.</v>

2822
02:04:01.020 --> 02:04:02.260
<v Speaker 4>Apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's before that,</v>

2823
02:04:02.261 --> 02:04:03.610
<v Speaker 4>when he was younger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he had no tattoos,</v>

2824
02:04:03.611 --> 02:04:04.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very few.</v>

2825
02:04:04.271 --> 02:04:05.920
<v Speaker 4>It was just annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just retired,</v>

2826
02:04:06.120 --> 02:04:06.820
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>

2827
02:04:06.880 --> 02:04:08.440
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think part of it,</v>

2828
02:04:08.441 --> 02:04:09.850
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the alcohol thing,</v>

2829
02:04:10.510 --> 02:04:13.420
<v Speaker 4>it's very possible that the depression,</v>
<v Speaker 4>alcohol,</v>

2830
02:04:13.421 --> 02:04:16.520
<v Speaker 4>that stuff has to do with head trauma to</v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2831
02:04:16.530 --> 02:04:16.850
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2832
02:04:17.590 --> 02:04:22.590
<v Speaker 4>And he thinks it might be as well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so he's retiring even though he's </v>

2833
02:04:22.590 --> 02:04:22.590
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

2834
02:04:22.590 --> 02:04:24.950
<v Speaker 4>he won recently and he looked really </v>
<v Speaker 4>good too.</v>

2835
02:04:25.380 --> 02:04:28.990
<v Speaker 4>He was in the midst of a comeback.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a talented fucking boxer.</v>

2836
02:04:29.350 --> 02:04:29.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

2837
02:04:30.100 --> 02:04:31.720
<v Speaker 4>But getting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting hit in the head,</v>

2838
02:04:31.750 --> 02:04:34.260
<v Speaker 4>walking around with headaches all day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could have done it,</v>

2839
02:04:34.410 --> 02:04:35.320
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was done.</v>

2840
02:04:35.330 --> 02:04:36.040
<v Speaker 4>It.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Keep it.</v>

2841
02:04:36.710 --> 02:04:37.620
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's not fun.</v>

2842
02:04:37.650 --> 02:04:39.300
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never did it to the extent that he did</v>

2843
02:04:39.301 --> 02:04:41.130
<v Speaker 4>it though when he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he did was incredible.</v>

2844
02:04:41.131 --> 02:04:42.690
<v Speaker 4>And he's a world champion and the amount</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

2845
02:04:42.750 --> 02:04:47.750
<v Speaker 4>just the amount of punishment that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>have to go through just in the rain </v>

2846
02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:49.590
<v Speaker 4>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's his Jesus Christ.</v>

2847
02:04:49.770 --> 02:04:50.400
<v Speaker 4>Just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2848
02:04:50.430 --> 02:04:51.510
<v Speaker 4>my main,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the training ring,</v>

2849
02:04:51.740 --> 02:04:53.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just everyday in the gym,</v>

2850
02:04:53.910 --> 02:04:55.110
<v Speaker 4>these guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2851
02:04:55.360 --> 02:04:57.380
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get caught all the time warm.</v>

2852
02:04:57.390 --> 02:05:01.170
<v Speaker 4>And the last time we fought was 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He Won.</v>

2853
02:05:01.230 --> 02:05:06.230
<v Speaker 4>And apparently he was a,</v>

<v Speaker 2>A lot,</v>

2970
02:09:59.960 --> 02:10:01.200
<v Speaker 2>a lot of different people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

2971
02:10:01.201 --> 02:10:03.870
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got a really interesting take on,</v>

2972
02:10:03.900 --> 02:10:04.710
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2973
02:10:04.740 --> 02:10:05.640
<v Speaker 2>justice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

2974
02:10:05.680 --> 02:10:08.670
<v Speaker 2>I had this Delta Force Guy I was talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about killing an American citizen and he</v>

2975
02:10:08.671 --> 02:10:11.160
<v Speaker 2>was kind of justifying it and vince in </v>
<v Speaker 2>la by Vera got on.</v>

2976
02:10:11.170 --> 02:10:12.240
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me tell you something.</v>

2977
02:10:12.720 --> 02:10:13.760
<v Speaker 2>That's the biggest bunch of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2978
02:10:13.761 --> 02:10:18.761
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he couldn't have been more on the other </v>

2979
02:10:18.761 --> 02:10:18.761
<v Speaker 2>side of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2980
02:10:18.761 --> 02:10:19.130
<v Speaker 2>that the US and the national defense act</v>
<v Speaker 2>and stuff.</v>

2981
02:10:19.160 --> 02:10:20.880
<v Speaker 2>We talk a lot about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He talked,</v>

2982
02:10:20.910 --> 02:10:24.330
<v Speaker 2>he just goes to town on the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is killing our country,</v>

2983
02:10:24.331 --> 02:10:27.420
<v Speaker 2>our due process and everything and he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>very articulate about it.</v>

2984
02:10:27.421 --> 02:10:32.421
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's going down the path of corruption </v>

2985
02:10:32.421 --> 02:10:34.050
<v Speaker 2>and we all see it and because now we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>all on the Internet,</v>

2986
02:10:34.050 --> 02:10:39.050
<v Speaker 1>we all get to talk about it and we get </v>
<v Speaker 1>to express our concerns and get to know </v>

2987
02:10:39.050 --> 02:10:39.720
<v Speaker 1>when the government says trust me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2988
02:10:40.220 --> 02:10:45.220
<v Speaker 1>well keeps happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like this new thing is this </v>

2989
02:10:45.220 --> 02:10:48.650
<v Speaker 1>Monsanto bill that just passed silently </v>
<v Speaker 1>through congress without any mainstream </v>

2990
02:10:49.771 --> 02:10:51.390
<v Speaker 1>exposure where they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2991
02:10:51.720 --> 02:10:56.720
<v Speaker 1>giving Monsanto a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all sorts of subsidies and all sorts of </v>

2992
02:10:57.630 --> 02:10:58.740
<v Speaker 1>abilities to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2993
02:10:58.741 --> 02:11:03.741
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hide the fact that genetically </v>

2994
02:11:03.741 --> 02:11:03.741
<v Speaker 1>modified foods are and things that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>buy.</v>

2995
02:11:04.170 --> 02:11:06.990
<v Speaker 1>It's creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's creepy because it's,</v>

2996
02:11:07.560 --> 02:11:12.560
<v Speaker 1>it's one of those things where it's all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would hope that they would one day </v>

2997
02:11:12.560 --> 02:11:12.870
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

2998
02:11:17.320 --> 02:11:17.770
<v Speaker 12>What was that</v>

2999
02:11:19.330 --> 02:11:22.840
<v Speaker 1>was the whistle to your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

3000
02:11:22.930 --> 02:11:24.250
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the gay shit.</v>

3001
02:11:24.710 --> 02:11:27.780
<v Speaker 1>I actually kinda like changed my ringer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A couple of.</v>

3002
02:11:28.660 --> 02:11:31.120
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck was I even talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about Monsanto.</v>

3003
02:11:31.210 --> 02:11:35.860
<v Speaker 1>I would hope that things would slowly </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to move into a better direction.</v>

3004
02:11:36.350 --> 02:11:39.130
<v Speaker 1>We're going to cut back on corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna attack it.</v>

3005
02:11:39.310 --> 02:11:42.130
<v Speaker 1>We're going to make for a more fair </v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

3006
02:11:42.310 --> 02:11:47.310
<v Speaker 1>We're going to only involve ourselves in</v>
<v Speaker 1>military campaigns that are Justin and </v>

3007
02:11:47.501 --> 02:11:49.660
<v Speaker 1>true and we're going to try to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3008
02:11:49.750 --> 02:11:52.930
<v Speaker 1>you got to change the rest of the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>to change the incentive structure if you</v>

3009
02:11:52.931 --> 02:11:54.010
<v Speaker 1>want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

3010
02:11:54.040 --> 02:11:55.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just weird,</v>

3011
02:11:55.810 --> 02:11:56.500
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3012
02:11:56.560 --> 02:11:59.890
<v Speaker 1>it's the biggest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The biggest danger is that when you have</v>

3013
02:11:59.891 --> 02:12:04.891
<v Speaker 1>good people behaving corruptly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you have a system that allows for </v>

3014
02:12:04.891 --> 02:12:08.161
<v Speaker 1>no other way to do business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that so that your system becomes an </v>

3015
02:12:08.161 --> 02:12:08.161
<v Speaker 1>economy of influence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that meritocracy.</v>

3016
02:12:08.161 --> 02:12:10.270
<v Speaker 1>So who you know is really how you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>

3017
02:12:10.271 --> 02:12:11.890
<v Speaker 1>not what you can do and that's where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3018
02:12:11.950 --> 02:12:16.950
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where we're headed in some </v>

3019
02:12:16.950 --> 02:12:16.950
<v Speaker 1>aspects and you have to be very careful </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

3020
02:12:16.950 --> 02:12:18.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least Lawrence lessig books as that.</v>

3021
02:12:18.161 --> 02:12:19.610
<v Speaker 1>In a republic last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I taught,</v>

3022
02:12:19.630 --> 02:12:21.910
<v Speaker 1>which I've talked about many times on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this podcast,</v>

3023
02:12:22.480 --> 02:12:24.830
<v Speaker 1>is that's a very important book to read </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3024
02:12:24.870 --> 02:12:26.110
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what he does,</v>

3025
02:12:26.111 --> 02:12:26.830
<v Speaker 1>he says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

3026
02:12:26.831 --> 02:12:30.100
<v Speaker 1>let me show you how Washington is </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt with a lot of good people try to</v>

3027
02:12:30.101 --> 02:12:33.100
<v Speaker 1>do the right thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can't do business without being</v>

3028
02:12:33.130 --> 02:12:33.460
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me,</v>

3029
02:12:33.550 --> 02:12:38.550
<v Speaker 1>let me explain to people don't know what</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck we're talking about what this </v>

3030
02:12:38.550 --> 02:12:38.710
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this is a pretty crazy shit.</v>

3031
02:12:39.160 --> 02:12:42.170
<v Speaker 1>It's a genetically modified food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3032
02:12:42.370 --> 02:12:46.210
<v Speaker 1>and the thing they're calling the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Monsanto Protection Act,</v>

3033
02:12:46.300 --> 02:12:51.300
<v Speaker 1>which was signed by President Obama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're calling it the Monsanto </v>

3034
02:12:51.300 --> 02:12:51.300
<v Speaker 1>Protection Act.</v>

3035
02:12:51.300 --> 02:12:51.300
<v Speaker 1>What it actually was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3036
02:12:51.310 --> 02:12:56.290
<v Speaker 1>it was added to an essential spending </v>
<v Speaker 1>bill without congressional hearings.</v>

3037
02:12:56.440 --> 02:13:01.420
<v Speaker 1>So they slept this rider and the rider </v>
<v Speaker 1>strips the power from the federal courts</v>

3038
02:13:01.421 --> 02:13:06.421
<v Speaker 1>to halt the sales and planting of </v>
<v Speaker 1>genetically modified foods even if </v>

3039
02:13:06.421 --> 02:13:08.410
<v Speaker 1>health concerns arise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3040
02:13:09.190 --> 02:13:11.260
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy.</v>

3041
02:13:12.010 --> 02:13:17.010
<v Speaker 1>The provision was simply an industry </v>
<v Speaker 1>ploy to continue to sell genetically </v>

3042
02:13:17.010 --> 02:13:21.121
<v Speaker 1>engineered seeds even without a court,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when a court of law has found that </v>

3043
02:13:21.121 --> 02:13:23.520
<v Speaker 1>they were approved by the u.</v>
<v Speaker 1>s d,</v>

3044
02:13:23.521 --> 02:13:28.521
<v Speaker 1>a illegally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the petition stated it's necessary to </v>

3045
02:13:28.521 --> 02:13:31.270
<v Speaker 1>fund an unprecedented tacked on us </v>
<v Speaker 1>judicial review.</v>

3046
02:13:31.290 --> 02:13:36.290
<v Speaker 1>Congress should not be meddling with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>judicial review process based solely on </v>

3047
02:13:36.301 --> 02:13:38.250
<v Speaker 1>the special interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a handful of companies.</v>

3048
02:13:38.400 --> 02:13:40.690
<v Speaker 1>This is from a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's uh,</v>

3049
02:13:40.750 --> 02:13:44.650
<v Speaker 1>I guess it was I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who wrote that.</v>

3050
02:13:44.830 --> 02:13:45.340
<v Speaker 1>Someone.</v>

3051
02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So essentially they're saying is they </v>

3052
02:13:52.000 --> 02:13:53.981
<v Speaker 1>snuck this in and people are just </v>
<v Speaker 1>finding out about it now and that </v>

3053
02:13:53.981 --> 02:13:56.480
<v Speaker 1>happens all the time in Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to protect the profits of</v>

3054
02:13:56.481 --> 02:13:57.390
<v Speaker 1>this company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

3055
02:13:57.450 --> 02:14:02.450
<v Speaker 1>that's the only way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only reason why you would hide </v>

3056
02:14:02.450 --> 02:14:02.450
<v Speaker 1>information as you're trying to protect </v>
<v Speaker 1>the product,</v>

3057
02:14:02.450 --> 02:14:06.970
<v Speaker 1>because if the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the genetically modified foods are </v>

3058
02:14:06.970 --> 02:14:08.090
<v Speaker 1>safe and they're in there and we find </v>
<v Speaker 1>out they're safe,</v>

3059
02:14:08.300 --> 02:14:13.300
<v Speaker 1>then we don't have to worry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if they might not be safe and you </v>

3060
02:14:13.300 --> 02:14:14.270
<v Speaker 1>want to sue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want you,</v>

3061
02:14:14.480 --> 02:14:16.130
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to know.</v>

3062
02:14:16.190 --> 02:14:18.860
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to be able to blame it </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the genetically modified foods.</v>

3063
02:14:18.861 --> 02:14:20.630
<v Speaker 1>You're not even going to know if it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>genetically modified.</v>

3064
02:14:20.631 --> 02:14:25.631
<v Speaker 1>If you have health issues that arise </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the genetically modified </v>

3065
02:14:25.631 --> 02:14:25.631
<v Speaker 1>foods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't even know the correlation.</v>

3066
02:14:25.631 --> 02:14:26.710
<v Speaker 1>You won't know what if you.</v>

3067
02:14:26.710 --> 02:14:29.780
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have a known issue that's come up</v>

3068
02:14:30.130 --> 02:14:35.130
<v Speaker 1>on amongst a small percentage of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that do respond poorly to jump </v>

3069
02:14:35.130 --> 02:14:36.830
<v Speaker 1>genetically modified foods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you won't even fucking know because</v>

3070
02:14:36.831 --> 02:14:41.831
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to be in the label </v>
<v Speaker 1>because some cons got paid and it's </v>

3071
02:14:41.831 --> 02:14:45.850
<v Speaker 1>crazy because the people who are selling</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetically modified foods should only </v>

3072
02:14:45.850 --> 02:14:48.700
<v Speaker 1>want to be selling healthy genetically </v>
<v Speaker 1>modified foods.</v>

3073
02:14:48.720 --> 02:14:53.720
<v Speaker 1>It is possible that science can figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>out a way to produce more food that's </v>

3074
02:14:53.720 --> 02:14:55.340
<v Speaker 1>more nutritious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is possible,</v>

3075
02:14:55.550 --> 02:14:58.940
<v Speaker 1>but it's also possible that they could </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it up and when.</v>

3076
02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:01.100
<v Speaker 1>When this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when something like this comes along and</v>

3077
02:15:01.101 --> 02:15:02.540
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is all this is,</v>

3078
02:15:02.570 --> 02:15:07.570
<v Speaker 1>they should call this the Monsanto </v>
<v Speaker 1>Information Act because all it is is </v>

3079
02:15:07.570 --> 02:15:09.170
<v Speaker 1>keeping information secret,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping it from people.</v>

3080
02:15:09.290 --> 02:15:10.940
<v Speaker 1>That's never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not only that,</v>

3081
02:15:11.180 --> 02:15:16.180
<v Speaker 1>it's also keep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also changing information in lying </v>

3082
02:15:16.180 --> 02:15:16.970
<v Speaker 1>about what's good for you and what's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're setting up corruption.</v>

3083
02:15:17.100 --> 02:15:17.900
<v Speaker 1>They're setting up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3084
02:15:17.950 --> 02:15:22.950
<v Speaker 1>so corruption can take place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know enough about genetically </v>

3085
02:15:22.950 --> 02:15:22.950
<v Speaker 1>modified foods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'll give you an example,</v>

3086
02:15:22.950 --> 02:15:23.150
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well No,</v>

3087
02:15:23.151 --> 02:15:25.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the food and nutrition board,</v>

3088
02:15:25.521 --> 02:15:30.521
<v Speaker 1>which sets the school standard for 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million children on what they can eat </v>

3089
02:15:30.521 --> 02:15:32.630
<v Speaker 1>because they've been hijacked by </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies like Nestle,</v>

3090
02:15:32.631 --> 02:15:37.631
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the big companies that have an </v>

3091
02:15:37.631 --> 02:15:39.461
<v Speaker 1>interest in selling their products.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coca Cola and stuff and and they hire </v>

3092
02:15:39.461 --> 02:15:39.480
<v Speaker 1>scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>read,</v>

3093
02:15:39.481 --> 02:15:41.660
<v Speaker 1>read the China study talks about this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3094
02:15:41.960 --> 02:15:43.310
<v Speaker 1>I'm paraphrasing here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they'll,</v>

3095
02:15:43.340 --> 02:15:48.340
<v Speaker 1>they'll hide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll stack the deck with scientists </v>

3096
02:15:48.340 --> 02:15:50.501
<v Speaker 1>that they basically hard to say that 25 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of your diet can be simple </v>

3097
02:15:50.631 --> 02:15:52.280
<v Speaker 1>sugars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means I can.</v>

3098
02:15:52.310 --> 02:15:56.630
<v Speaker 1>I can have vending machines in there </v>
<v Speaker 1>that sell soda and twix bars and seven.</v>

3099
02:15:56.631 --> 02:16:01.631
<v Speaker 1>That's part of your lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where when you're ignorant and </v>

3100
02:16:01.631 --> 02:16:02.900
<v Speaker 1>you don't know how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how the system works,</v>

3101
02:16:02.901 --> 02:16:06.890
<v Speaker 1>how the incentive structure works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are going to pay a price for it with</v>

3102
02:16:06.891 --> 02:16:11.891
<v Speaker 1>your health and so are your kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's why I always tell people it's </v>

3103
02:16:11.891 --> 02:16:15.410
<v Speaker 1>you can't not be politically committed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a luxury you can afford,</v>

3104
02:16:15.411 --> 02:16:20.411
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because what happens is it becomes a </v>

3105
02:16:20.411 --> 02:16:20.420
<v Speaker 1>concentration of vested interests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at,</v>

3106
02:16:20.450 --> 02:16:21.920
<v Speaker 1>look at Wall Street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

3107
02:16:21.921 --> 02:16:26.921
<v Speaker 1>they compete with each other until </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone comes in with legislation and </v>

3108
02:16:26.921 --> 02:16:30.070
<v Speaker 1>they get very good at hiring lobbyists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get very good</v>

3109
02:16:30.070 --> 02:16:35.050
<v Speaker 4>at their economy of influence and </v>
<v Speaker 4>figuring out how to buy the right people</v>

3110
02:16:35.080 --> 02:16:40.080
<v Speaker 4>to keep business as usual.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why you have to teach kids to </v>

3111
02:16:41.411 --> 02:16:44.290
<v Speaker 4>entering the system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now to stop that pattern,</v>

3112
02:16:44.580 --> 02:16:49.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have to figure out a way to profit </v>

3113
02:16:49.580 --> 02:16:52.591
<v Speaker 4>overall.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know the whole thing's a problem </v>

3114
02:16:52.591 --> 02:16:53.710
<v Speaker 4>with profit as long as it's earned </v>
<v Speaker 4>honestly,</v>

3115
02:16:53.711 --> 02:16:58.711
<v Speaker 4>and you're playing by the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem is when you have companies </v>

3116
02:16:58.711 --> 02:17:00.190
<v Speaker 4>that stack the deck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know of course,</v>

3117
02:17:00.520 --> 02:17:01.990
<v Speaker 4>and so,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so how does that happen?</v>

3118
02:17:01.991 --> 02:17:04.630
<v Speaker 4>You've got to figure out how that </v>
<v Speaker 4>happens and why it happened,</v>

3119
02:17:04.631 --> 02:17:07.470
<v Speaker 4>and then that's the way you change it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to figure out first how it happens.</v>

3120
02:17:07.471 --> 02:17:12.010
<v Speaker 4>Just so transparent when something like </v>
<v Speaker 4>this Monsanto thing comes up because all</v>

3121
02:17:12.011 --> 02:17:15.840
<v Speaker 4>they're doing is keeping information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all they're doing.</v>

3122
02:17:15.870 --> 02:17:20.870
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They should never be able to keep </v>

3123
02:17:20.870 --> 02:17:20.870
<v Speaker 4>information because if you have a good </v>
<v Speaker 4>product,</v>

3124
02:17:20.870 --> 02:17:23.140
<v Speaker 4>like let's say you're selling oranges,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you can prove,</v>

3125
02:17:23.141 --> 02:17:26.290
<v Speaker 4>if you look at the data that oranges are</v>
<v Speaker 4>very rich in vitamin C,</v>

3126
02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:28.330
<v Speaker 4>they have healthy fiber to them.</v>

3127
02:17:28.480 --> 02:17:32.500
<v Speaker 4>When you eat an orange with your lunch,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's probably a really healthy choice.</v>

3128
02:17:32.620 --> 02:17:37.620
<v Speaker 4>It's good for you and we have a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>data to back that up so all the </v>

3129
02:17:37.620 --> 02:17:39.370
<v Speaker 4>information on oranges is readily </v>
<v Speaker 4>available.</v>

3130
02:17:39.590 --> 02:17:41.140
<v Speaker 4>You can go look it up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know why?</v>

3131
02:17:41.230 --> 02:17:42.990
<v Speaker 4>Because there's nothing bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing to hide.</v>

3132
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:44.440
<v Speaker 4>It's a fucking orange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

3133
02:17:44.620 --> 02:17:47.340
<v Speaker 4>But when you start monkeying around with</v>
<v Speaker 4>oranges and mold,</v>

3134
02:17:47.350 --> 02:17:52.350
<v Speaker 4>this is an orange that doesn't react </v>
<v Speaker 4>badly to certain pesticides and this is </v>

3135
02:17:52.350 --> 02:17:55.780
<v Speaker 4>an orange that creates its own pesticide</v>
<v Speaker 4>and kills off mosquitoes.</v>

3136
02:17:55.781 --> 02:17:58.150
<v Speaker 4>Or this is an orange that you don't tell</v>
<v Speaker 4>me.</v>

3137
02:17:59.650 --> 02:18:02.260
<v Speaker 4>Now we got a real problem because that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>not really an orange.</v>

3138
02:18:02.410 --> 02:18:07.410
<v Speaker 4>That's an orange that you fucked with </v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't know if you really know </v>

3139
02:18:07.410 --> 02:18:10.750
<v Speaker 4>what's going to happen with that orange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I eat one of these a day for the next</v>

3140
02:18:10.751 --> 02:18:13.000
<v Speaker 4>20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that going to write my asshole out?</v>

3141
02:18:13.180 --> 02:18:14.070
<v Speaker 4>You know what is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is it?</v>

3142
02:18:14.071 --> 02:18:14.770
<v Speaker 4>Gonna?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it gonna?</v>

3143
02:18:15.010 --> 02:18:17.320
<v Speaker 4>Erase my memory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At least give me the information.</v>

3144
02:18:17.740 --> 02:18:20.600
<v Speaker 4>I want to know if he's got the gene of a</v>
<v Speaker 4>jelly fish because it was so,</v>

3145
02:18:20.620 --> 02:18:25.620
<v Speaker 4>so it doesn't freeze.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to know that executive told me </v>

3146
02:18:25.620 --> 02:18:25.620
<v Speaker 4>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Show me everything.</v>

3147
02:18:25.620 --> 02:18:28.180
<v Speaker 4>You've got to make my own choices.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't hide information.</v>

3148
02:18:28.181 --> 02:18:30.130
<v Speaker 4>And the idea that they would do that </v>
<v Speaker 4>with our food,</v>

3149
02:18:30.131 --> 02:18:35.131
<v Speaker 4>which is something that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have a health crisis in this country </v>

3150
02:18:35.131 --> 02:18:37.090
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even though we have access to all of the</v>

3151
02:18:37.091 --> 02:18:41.560
<v Speaker 4>information on the back of food,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all of the nutritional information isn't</v>

3152
02:18:41.561 --> 02:18:44.830
<v Speaker 4>readily available and almost anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we buy in the store except for like</v>

3153
02:18:44.831 --> 02:18:47.860
<v Speaker 4>meats and things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when we do that,</v>

3154
02:18:48.430 --> 02:18:53.430
<v Speaker 4>we still don't use it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We still use that information and so </v>

3155
02:18:53.430 --> 02:18:56.311
<v Speaker 4>many people are eating terrible food </v>
<v Speaker 4>everyday and so many people are or </v>

3156
02:18:56.311 --> 02:18:57.700
<v Speaker 4>unhealthy and sick all the time and </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're essentially poisoned themselves.</v>

3157
02:18:57.700 --> 02:19:00.000
<v Speaker 4>So that's with inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

3158
02:19:00.050 --> 02:19:05.050
<v Speaker 4>That's when the fucking information with</v>
<v Speaker 4>readily apparent bad things to eat and </v>

3159
02:19:06.881 --> 02:19:08.770
<v Speaker 4>people choose them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>

3160
02:19:08.771 --> 02:19:09.290
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3161
02:19:09.340 --> 02:19:14.340
<v Speaker 4>you can't stop inflammation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't because what you're doing is </v>

3162
02:19:14.340 --> 02:19:17.680
<v Speaker 4>you're setting yourself up so that you </v>
<v Speaker 4>can lie and protect people in power.</v>

3163
02:19:17.681 --> 02:19:19.450
<v Speaker 4>That's the only reason you shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing it.</v>

3164
02:19:20.200 --> 02:19:25.200
<v Speaker 4>We already have a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We already have a problem with people </v>

3165
02:19:25.200 --> 02:19:28.021
<v Speaker 4>having shitty diets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We already have a problem with this </v>

3166
02:19:28.021 --> 02:19:28.730
<v Speaker 4>weird thing with humans were stuff that </v>
<v Speaker 4>tastes amazing.</v>

3167
02:19:28.731 --> 02:19:33.731
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking killing you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like krispy Kreme donuts are fucking </v>

3168
02:19:33.731 --> 02:19:35.390
<v Speaker 4>delicious,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's a toxin.</v>

3169
02:19:35.420 --> 02:19:37.600
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are like pure sugar.</v>

3170
02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.730
<v Speaker 4>You go to a lot of parts of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you and I do travel a lot.</v>

3171
02:19:41.070 --> 02:19:44.450
<v Speaker 4>There's not a lot of access to real good</v>
<v Speaker 4>food and there's access to,</v>

3172
02:19:44.480 --> 02:19:49.480
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to different restaurant chains or </v>

3173
02:19:49.480 --> 02:19:49.480
<v Speaker 4>there's access to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3174
02:19:49.480 --> 02:19:51.170
<v Speaker 4>just a bunch of fast food and some areas</v>
<v Speaker 4>we can get healthier.</v>

3175
02:19:51.830 --> 02:19:53.190
<v Speaker 4>Supermarkets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can,</v>

3176
02:19:53.210 --> 02:19:55.670
<v Speaker 4>you can always,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but even then we'd get a tomato and it's</v>

3177
02:19:55.671 --> 02:19:57.830
<v Speaker 4>Pale.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is white fucking tomato,</v>

3178
02:19:57.831 --> 02:19:59.840
<v Speaker 4>like what's in that type and hitting the</v>
<v Speaker 4>gas chamber.</v>

3179
02:19:59.841 --> 02:20:01.370
<v Speaker 4>That's how.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why not only that,</v>

3180
02:20:01.380 --> 02:20:04.100
<v Speaker 4>the genetics of the thing have </v>
<v Speaker 4>completely been altered so they can keep</v>

3181
02:20:04.101 --> 02:20:05.810
<v Speaker 4>them on a truck for a week,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

3182
02:20:05.811 --> 02:20:08.030
<v Speaker 4>It's a sort of the same thing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>they've done with,</v>

3183
02:20:08.050 --> 02:20:11.500
<v Speaker 4>with raw milk and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know and people that are screaming at,</v>

3184
02:20:11.560 --> 02:20:15.770
<v Speaker 4>you know what we perceived the oldies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lloyd's and people from boom.</v>

3185
02:20:15.771 --> 02:20:16.550
<v Speaker 4>Raw Milk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3186
02:20:16.551 --> 02:20:16.810
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3187
02:20:16.811 --> 02:20:17.270
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3188
02:20:17.480 --> 02:20:18.860
<v Speaker 4>They're going to die anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

3189
02:20:18.980 --> 02:20:20.360
<v Speaker 4>everyone's going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're gonna die too.</v>

3190
02:20:20.450 --> 02:20:22.010
<v Speaker 4>That's not the point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get what you're saying.</v>

3191
02:20:22.011 --> 02:20:23.630
<v Speaker 4>I know it logically.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're correct,</v>

3192
02:20:23.631 --> 02:20:28.631
<v Speaker 4>ethically correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I understand you're talking about </v>

3193
02:20:28.631 --> 02:20:28.631
<v Speaker 4>transparency.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about,</v>

3194
02:20:28.631 --> 02:20:30.170
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking not just about transparency.</v>

3195
02:20:30.320 --> 02:20:35.320
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking that I'm saying that too </v>
<v Speaker 4>many people are telling too many people </v>

3196
02:20:35.320 --> 02:20:37.910
<v Speaker 4>what is and isn't okay to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a real problem.</v>

3197
02:20:38.120 --> 02:20:43.120
<v Speaker 4>And I always say that the law,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way we should have law in this </v>

3198
02:20:43.120 --> 02:20:46.421
<v Speaker 4>country is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>could you imagine clint eastwood </v>

3199
02:20:46.421 --> 02:20:49.100
<v Speaker 4>arresting you for it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If he had a gun and he pointed at you,</v>

3200
02:20:49.130 --> 02:20:54.130
<v Speaker 4>could you imagine the clinics?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We would arrest you for the credit </v>

3201
02:20:54.130 --> 02:20:54.130
<v Speaker 4>clinic square prints,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or you're growing hemp.</v>

3202
02:20:54.130 --> 02:20:56.300
<v Speaker 4>If you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you could you imagine dirty Harry,</v>

3203
02:20:56.301 --> 02:20:58.800
<v Speaker 4>where he breaks down hemp farms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tell and Oh,</v>

3204
02:20:58.810 --> 02:21:03.810
<v Speaker 4>we're you going to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're going to make food and clothes </v>

3205
02:21:03.810 --> 02:21:05.560
<v Speaker 4>the fuck you are getting a squad car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If anything other than that is a </v>

3206
02:21:06.741 --> 02:21:08.270
<v Speaker 4>bullshit law.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3207
02:21:08.271 --> 02:21:13.271
<v Speaker 4>I could imagine dirty Harry arresting </v>
<v Speaker 4>these cons that are getting paid off by </v>

3208
02:21:13.271 --> 02:21:14.600
<v Speaker 4>Monsanto.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can imagine.</v>

3209
02:21:14.601 --> 02:21:17.830
<v Speaker 4>Dirty Harry catching some scotch </v>
<v Speaker 4>drinking asshole,</v>

3210
02:21:17.940 --> 02:21:19.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in his Senate Room,</v>

3211
02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:20.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3212
02:21:20.720 --> 02:21:23.240
<v Speaker 4>beating some hooker to death and he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3213
02:21:23.241 --> 02:21:27.270
<v Speaker 4>he walks in and you fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got Monsanto through and yeah,</v>

3214
02:21:27.271 --> 02:21:28.130
<v Speaker 4>right dead man.</v>

3215
02:21:28.210 --> 02:21:33.210
<v Speaker 4>You're a bad debt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he shoots him dead man Callahan and </v>

3216
02:21:33.210 --> 02:21:37.421
<v Speaker 4>you're happy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're happy that he shot the evil </v>

3217
02:21:37.421 --> 02:21:37.421
<v Speaker 4>Monsanto guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3218
02:21:37.421 --> 02:21:37.421
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that seems like plenty.</v>

3219
02:21:37.421 --> 02:21:38.390
<v Speaker 4>Should might want to step in on this </v>
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>

3220
02:21:38.810 --> 02:21:41.000
<v Speaker 4>But could you see clinics with a rescue </v>
<v Speaker 4>for having a,</v>

3221
02:21:41.001 --> 02:21:42.880
<v Speaker 4>a roach in your car?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3222
02:21:42.920 --> 02:21:43.820
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course not.</v>

3223
02:21:43.821 --> 02:21:46.640
<v Speaker 4>He would maybe slap you and tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't be stupid.</v>

3224
02:21:46.820 --> 02:21:51.820
<v Speaker 4>Don't be stupid kid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Michael Pollan says you can vote three </v>

3225
02:21:51.820 --> 02:21:52.070
<v Speaker 4>times a day by what you put on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>plate.</v>

3226
02:21:52.130 --> 02:21:52.520
<v Speaker 4>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

3227
02:21:52.521 --> 02:21:53.480
<v Speaker 4>you go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good point.</v>

3228
02:21:53.510 --> 02:21:55.310
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why I've been telling people,</v>

3229
02:21:55.340 --> 02:22:00.340
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one day the stoners are going to unite </v>

3230
02:22:00.340 --> 02:22:03.370
<v Speaker 4>because there's a lot of a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>bullshit out there and you need to </v>

3231
02:22:03.370 --> 02:22:05.831
<v Speaker 4>respect the donor dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the way of the future though is </v>

3232
02:22:05.831 --> 02:22:06.350
<v Speaker 4>probably genetically modified foods.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ultimately.</v>

3233
02:22:06.360 --> 02:22:11.360
<v Speaker 4>Either way the future is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think we can see that many </v>

3234
02:22:11.360 --> 02:22:11.360
<v Speaker 4>people without.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Without funding,</v>

3235
02:22:11.360 --> 02:22:11.760
<v Speaker 4>we can find people with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I.</v>

3236
02:22:11.770 --> 02:22:16.770
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe it and I think as time </v>

3237
02:22:16.770 --> 02:22:18.890
<v Speaker 4>goes on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the origin of those thoughts is profit.</v>

3238
02:22:19.190 --> 02:22:24.190
<v Speaker 4>I do not believe that the origin of </v>
<v Speaker 4>those thoughts is because we're really </v>

3239
02:22:24.190 --> 02:22:26.160
<v Speaker 4>concerned with feeding people because </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not something that's not</v>

3240
02:22:26.160 --> 02:22:29.190
<v Speaker 3>something that you hear from the federal</v>
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>

3241
02:22:29.280 --> 02:22:31.740
<v Speaker 3>That's not something that was taken into</v>
<v Speaker 3>considerations.</v>

3242
02:22:31.741 --> 02:22:36.741
<v Speaker 3>When you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you look at how much money they </v>

3243
02:22:36.741 --> 02:22:37.140
<v Speaker 3>spend on defense contractors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking billions and billions of dollars</v>

3244
02:22:37.141 --> 02:22:39.410
<v Speaker 3>on a daily basis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on a yearly basis rather,</v>

3245
02:22:39.550 --> 02:22:40.980
<v Speaker 3>and defense contractors,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much,</v>

3246
02:22:41.040 --> 02:22:43.410
<v Speaker 3>how much they spend feeding people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking zero.</v>

3247
02:22:43.590 --> 02:22:45.930
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they had the same resources that they</v>

3248
02:22:45.931 --> 02:22:49.590
<v Speaker 3>put into the military and they put that </v>
<v Speaker 3>into feeding people,</v>

3249
02:22:49.591 --> 02:22:54.591
<v Speaker 3>there would be incredibly successful in </v>
<v Speaker 3>feeding people so when they come along </v>

3250
02:22:54.591 --> 02:22:58.341
<v Speaker 3>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need genetically modified foods </v>

3251
02:22:58.341 --> 02:22:58.341
<v Speaker 3>because we need to feed people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're not trying to feed people.</v>

3252
02:22:58.341 --> 02:23:01.050
<v Speaker 3>They're not talking about feed people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want profit should all food,</v>

3253
02:23:01.051 --> 02:23:02.880
<v Speaker 3>all food has been genetically modified,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of it.</v>

3254
02:23:02.881 --> 02:23:07.881
<v Speaker 3>Everything we do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a difference between selective </v>

3255
02:23:07.881 --> 02:23:08.700
<v Speaker 3>breeding and growing and genetically </v>
<v Speaker 3>modifying.</v>

3256
02:23:09.040 --> 02:23:14.040
<v Speaker 3>They are changing things at the genetic </v>
<v Speaker 3>level to give them resistance to </v>

3257
02:23:14.221 --> 02:23:15.120
<v Speaker 3>pesticides.</v>

3258
02:23:15.120 --> 02:23:18.000
<v Speaker 3>But if you're doing a lot of shit out </v>
<v Speaker 3>there like golden rice,</v>

3259
02:23:18.001 --> 02:23:20.950
<v Speaker 3>which is very hot and fast,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well there's not.</v>

3260
02:23:21.470 --> 02:23:24.630
<v Speaker 3>It's not a yes or a no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not yes or no.</v>

3261
02:23:24.631 --> 02:23:26.010
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm saying that you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3262
02:23:26.011 --> 02:23:29.400
<v Speaker 3>I think that the rise of technology,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even in food is inevitable.</v>

3263
02:23:29.840 --> 02:23:32.640
<v Speaker 3>There's a good side to it and they're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There can also be an evil side to it.</v>

3264
02:23:32.641 --> 02:23:33.640
<v Speaker 3>And I think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3265
02:23:34.070 --> 02:23:39.070
<v Speaker 3>I think the question is transparency and</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowing and seeing all the data and </v>

3266
02:23:39.300 --> 02:23:44.300
<v Speaker 3>holding companies accountable and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and realizing that technology is not a </v>

3267
02:23:44.300 --> 02:23:44.970
<v Speaker 3>bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is a good thing.</v>

3268
02:23:45.090 --> 02:23:50.090
<v Speaker 3>We probably,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we have 80 million people on this </v>

3269
02:23:50.090 --> 02:23:51.921
<v Speaker 3>planet in 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're probably going to have to resort </v>

3270
02:23:51.921 --> 02:23:54.321
<v Speaker 3>to genetically modified foods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We already are in some parts of the </v>

3271
02:23:54.321 --> 02:23:57.411
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The question becomes how do you do it </v>

3272
02:23:57.411 --> 02:23:59.511
<v Speaker 3>responsibly and ethically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the real issue is Paul risers character </v>

3273
02:23:59.511 --> 02:24:03.411
<v Speaker 3>from aliens is that country sneaky slimy</v>
<v Speaker 3>guy who wanted to bring the alien back </v>

3274
02:24:04.290 --> 02:24:06.300
<v Speaker 3>and use it as a biological weapon.</v>

3275
02:24:06.300 --> 02:24:11.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was what was wrong with that </v>

3276
02:24:11.300 --> 02:24:14.211
<v Speaker 3>fucking mood.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what you call full circle as </v>

3277
02:24:14.211 --> 02:24:14.490
<v Speaker 3>jealous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what's wrong with lobbyists.</v>

3278
02:24:14.491 --> 02:24:19.491
<v Speaker 3>That's what's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's wrong with influencing the </v>

3279
02:24:19.491 --> 02:24:21.570
<v Speaker 3>congress to let something like this </v>
<v Speaker 3>sneak through where franken foods can be</v>

3280
02:24:21.571 --> 02:24:26.571
<v Speaker 3>in your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your diet and you're not even aware of </v>

3281
02:24:26.571 --> 02:24:26.571
<v Speaker 3>it or the right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3282
02:24:26.571 --> 02:24:26.571
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

3283
02:24:26.571 --> 02:24:28.290
<v Speaker 3>that's exactly right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were and even comes,</v>

3284
02:24:28.300 --> 02:24:29.100
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3285
02:24:29.101 --> 02:24:30.720
<v Speaker 3>not what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That matters.</v>

3286
02:24:30.721 --> 02:24:32.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And even people who might say,</v>

3287
02:24:32.341 --> 02:24:37.341
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're ignorant as to the effect of </v>

3288
02:24:37.341 --> 02:24:37.530
<v Speaker 3>genetically modified foods you're in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are absolutely right.</v>

3289
02:24:37.531 --> 02:24:40.050
<v Speaker 3>I have not read that much about </v>
<v Speaker 3>genetically modified foods.</v>

3290
02:24:40.051 --> 02:24:44.400
<v Speaker 3>I have read both pro and con.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have heard like Carrie Santa Maria had</v>

3291
02:24:44.430 --> 02:24:49.430
<v Speaker 3>some very good points about genetically </v>
<v Speaker 3>modified foods and you have some very </v>

3292
02:24:49.430 --> 02:24:49.430
<v Speaker 3>good points and I've,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've,</v>

3293
02:24:49.430 --> 02:24:51.660
<v Speaker 3>I've seen like at Penn Jillette had some</v>
<v Speaker 3>very good points.</v>

3294
02:24:51.660 --> 02:24:54.510
<v Speaker 3>He and I had a discussion about </v>
<v Speaker 3>genetically modified foods and I respect</v>

3295
02:24:54.511 --> 02:24:57.840
<v Speaker 3>his opinion as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is not that this isn't the argument.</v>

3296
02:24:57.870 --> 02:25:02.130
<v Speaker 3>The argument is about transparency and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's about the access to information and</v>

3297
02:25:02.131 --> 02:25:07.131
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's about someone who is supposed </v>

3298
02:25:07.131 --> 02:25:07.131
<v Speaker 3>to be looking out for the interests of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the people,</v>

3299
02:25:07.131 --> 02:25:10.470
<v Speaker 3>allowing people to withhold information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should never do that.</v>

3300
02:25:10.530 --> 02:25:15.530
<v Speaker 3>You should just never do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should never allow someone who's </v>

3301
02:25:15.530 --> 02:25:17.610
<v Speaker 3>selling something to withhold some weird</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit that they're doing to it that might</v>

3302
02:25:17.611 --> 02:25:22.611
<v Speaker 3>affect your health.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to know if I'm eating it has a </v>

3303
02:25:22.611 --> 02:25:22.611
<v Speaker 3>jelly bean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a jellyfish,</v>

3304
02:25:22.611 --> 02:25:23.740
<v Speaker 3>a gene in it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or it's after.</v>

3305
02:25:23.741 --> 02:25:23.980
<v Speaker 3>I want</v>

3306
02:25:23.980 --> 02:25:25.750
<v Speaker 4>to know that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tell me everything you know,</v>

3307
02:25:25.810 --> 02:25:30.810
<v Speaker 4>and this is sort of semi hypocritical </v>
<v Speaker 4>coming from me because I'm in the </v>

3308
02:25:30.810 --> 02:25:31.240
<v Speaker 4>supplement company,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

3309
02:25:31.300 --> 02:25:36.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm involved with with a supplement </v>
<v Speaker 4>company and then you take the </v>

3310
02:25:36.300 --> 02:25:36.300
<v Speaker 4>supplements you're taking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's also,</v>

3311
02:25:36.300 --> 02:25:40.651
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's enough tangible data on the </v>

3312
02:25:40.651 --> 02:25:42.700
<v Speaker 4>subject that I'm confident in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>results and that I also have benefited.</v>

3313
02:25:43.060 --> 02:25:48.060
<v Speaker 4>I know that I've benefited from taking </v>
<v Speaker 4>supplements I've know that have </v>

3314
02:25:48.060 --> 02:25:50.941
<v Speaker 4>benefited.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know that my health is pretty fucking </v>

3315
02:25:50.941 --> 02:25:52.030
<v Speaker 4>good and I know also a lot of it has to </v>
<v Speaker 4>do with diet.</v>

3316
02:25:52.240 --> 02:25:54.640
<v Speaker 4>A lot of it has to do with exercise and </v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of it has to do with genetics,</v>

3317
02:25:54.641 --> 02:25:57.070
<v Speaker 4>no doubt about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I am very confident.</v>

3318
02:25:57.071 --> 02:26:02.071
<v Speaker 4>I've gone through periods of have even </v>
<v Speaker 4>made experiments where have backed off </v>

3319
02:26:02.071 --> 02:26:03.490
<v Speaker 4>supplements and I get blood work done on</v>
<v Speaker 4>a regular basis.</v>

3320
02:26:03.490 --> 02:26:06.880
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty aware of what the fuck's </v>
<v Speaker 4>going on and when my nutrients,</v>

3321
02:26:06.881 --> 02:26:09.010
<v Speaker 4>we're all at a very high level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I function better.</v>

3322
02:26:09.220 --> 02:26:10.120
<v Speaker 4>I just do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know I do.</v>

3323
02:26:10.121 --> 02:26:12.130
<v Speaker 4>I have more energy and feel better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

3324
02:26:12.131 --> 02:26:15.370
<v Speaker 4>when it's all done in conjunction,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just not enough.</v>

3325
02:26:15.450 --> 02:26:17.740
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you,</v>

3326
02:26:17.860 --> 02:26:22.860
<v Speaker 4>if you look at the negative aspects of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that could possibly come from </v>

3327
02:26:25.061 --> 02:26:30.061
<v Speaker 4>supplementation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's not really enough information </v>

3328
02:26:30.061 --> 02:26:30.061
<v Speaker 4>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like how many,</v>

3329
02:26:30.061 --> 02:26:30.240
<v Speaker 4>how many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3330
02:26:30.700 --> 02:26:33.550
<v Speaker 4>vitamin D pills can you take before it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>makes you sick.</v>

3331
02:26:33.600 --> 02:26:34.120
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many,</v>

3332
02:26:34.310 --> 02:26:36.430
<v Speaker 4>how many people take the wrong amount of</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

3333
02:26:36.610 --> 02:26:37.460
<v Speaker 4>how many people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

3334
02:26:37.510 --> 02:26:40.870
<v Speaker 4>it's a real trial and error thing unless</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're doing blood work.</v>

3335
02:26:40.871 --> 02:26:43.330
<v Speaker 4>So I always encourage people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're interested in your health,</v>

3336
02:26:43.780 --> 02:26:48.780
<v Speaker 4>you got to know what the fuck is really </v>
<v Speaker 4>going on in your same ferris has get </v>

3337
02:26:48.780 --> 02:26:49.300
<v Speaker 4>blood work done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't take,</v>

3338
02:26:49.660 --> 02:26:50.590
<v Speaker 4>don't take guesses.</v>

3339
02:26:50.590 --> 02:26:55.590
<v Speaker 4>He found out he was low and I think my </v>
<v Speaker 4>rick acid and that's why I take coconut </v>

3340
02:26:55.590 --> 02:26:55.590
<v Speaker 4>oil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The only place you can find,</v>

3341
02:26:55.590 --> 02:26:57.580
<v Speaker 4>I think it's called myrick or my silicic</v>
<v Speaker 4>acid.</v>

3342
02:26:57.581 --> 02:26:59.320
<v Speaker 4>The only place you can find it as in </v>
<v Speaker 4>sperm,</v>

3343
02:26:59.321 --> 02:27:02.320
<v Speaker 4>whale oil and coconut oil.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I started taking it.</v>

3344
02:27:02.321 --> 02:27:07.321
<v Speaker 4>I gotta tell you man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I take a teaspoon or a tablespoon </v>

3345
02:27:07.321 --> 02:27:07.321
<v Speaker 4>in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do,</v>

3346
02:27:07.321 --> 02:27:08.170
<v Speaker 4>but maybe a psychological,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I feel better.</v>

3347
02:27:08.171 --> 02:27:13.171
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel better when I do things like the </v>

3348
02:27:13.171 --> 02:27:13.171
<v Speaker 4>Kale shakes I want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I juice Kale when I take a,</v>

3349
02:27:13.171 --> 02:27:18.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>coconut oil is present and I know that </v>

3350
02:27:18.070 --> 02:27:18.070
<v Speaker 4>people are skeptical.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They were like,</v>

3351
02:27:18.070 --> 02:27:20.440
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe people are bullshitting.</v>

3352
02:27:20.441 --> 02:27:22.660
<v Speaker 4>Maybe this is just more in placebo </v>
<v Speaker 4>effect.</v>

3353
02:27:22.661 --> 02:27:24.430
<v Speaker 4>Maybe this is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it makes sense.</v>

3354
02:27:24.510 --> 02:27:26.890
<v Speaker 4>It's a drug man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Treat it like it's not just that.</v>

3355
02:27:26.890 --> 02:27:29.950
<v Speaker 4>It's also like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what exactly is your body?</v>

3356
02:27:30.010 --> 02:27:31.720
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why does it need nutrients?</v>

3357
02:27:31.750 --> 02:27:36.750
<v Speaker 4>What is really going on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's this some sort of a chemical </v>

3358
02:27:36.750 --> 02:27:39.151
<v Speaker 4>process and it just stands to reason </v>
<v Speaker 4>that the more building blocks it gets </v>

3359
02:27:40.630 --> 02:27:43.480
<v Speaker 4>for repair,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for a killing,</v>

3360
02:27:43.481 --> 02:27:46.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>taking out anti radicals,</v>

3361
02:27:46.900 --> 02:27:51.900
<v Speaker 4>free radicals for destroying free </v>
<v Speaker 4>radicals in your system for helping you </v>

3362
02:27:51.900 --> 02:27:54.640
<v Speaker 4>strengthen your immune system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All those different things.</v>

3363
02:27:54.641 --> 02:27:58.630
<v Speaker 4>It just only makes sense that if the </v>
<v Speaker 4>machine has all it needs,</v>

3364
02:27:58.631 --> 02:27:59.940
<v Speaker 4>it will function better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It did.</v>

3365
02:27:59.941 --> 02:28:02.710
<v Speaker 4>Did Tim Ferriss tell you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had him on the podcast and he said he,</v>

3366
02:28:02.740 --> 02:28:03.400
<v Speaker 4>he did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

3367
02:28:03.490 --> 02:28:08.490
<v Speaker 4>he went to the blue zone and Okinawa and</v>
<v Speaker 4>see where they have the one area where </v>

3368
02:28:08.490 --> 02:28:09.130
<v Speaker 4>they live longer than anybody else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it like a choral thing?</v>

3369
02:28:09.220 --> 02:28:10.120
<v Speaker 4>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>

3370
02:28:10.330 --> 02:28:15.330
<v Speaker 4>he said he isolated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was interested in seeing what they </v>

3371
02:28:15.330 --> 02:28:15.330
<v Speaker 4>don't do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One thing they don't eat rice.</v>

3372
02:28:15.330 --> 02:28:16.120
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they blue potatoes,</v>

3373
02:28:16.610 --> 02:28:19.200
<v Speaker 4>a blue potatoes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

3374
02:28:19.240 --> 02:28:22.070
<v Speaker 4>But he also said that I tried</v>

3375
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:24.200
<v Speaker 1>to guess what they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he said there are a couple of things</v>

3376
02:28:24.201 --> 02:28:27.440
<v Speaker 1>that they have that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that very important for health one,</v>

3377
02:28:27.441 --> 02:28:32.000
<v Speaker 1>they never retire and too strong fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>communities and,</v>

3378
02:28:32.570 --> 02:28:34.310
<v Speaker 1>and they always eat just enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>

3379
02:28:34.311 --> 02:28:36.140
<v Speaker 1>there's a saying for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I eat just enough.</v>

3380
02:28:36.200 --> 02:28:41.200
<v Speaker 1>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never stuff but mainly they think the </v>

3381
02:28:41.200 --> 02:28:44.201
<v Speaker 1>two main things and Malcolm Mcdowell </v>
<v Speaker 1>gladwell talks about this community is </v>

3382
02:28:44.201 --> 02:28:47.300
<v Speaker 1>fucking important for longevity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>community and never retiring.</v>

3383
02:28:47.301 --> 02:28:52.301
<v Speaker 1>Being interested in involved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>something is so important for your </v>

3384
02:28:52.301 --> 02:28:52.340
<v Speaker 1>health and it doesn't seem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems metaphysical.</v>

3385
02:28:52.341 --> 02:28:53.720
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem physical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you know,</v>

3386
02:28:53.721 --> 02:28:55.100
<v Speaker 1>you can like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

3387
02:28:55.101 --> 02:29:00.101
<v Speaker 1>this town,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rosetta and heart disease in the </v>

3388
02:29:00.101 --> 02:29:00.560
<v Speaker 1>fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this country with epidemic,</v>

3389
02:29:00.680 --> 02:29:05.680
<v Speaker 1>they'd open up soldiers who are at at 21</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of their car arteries were 80 </v>

3390
02:29:05.680 --> 02:29:06.770
<v Speaker 1>percent clog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was epidemic.</v>

3391
02:29:07.160 --> 02:29:12.160
<v Speaker 1>They go to this place Rosetta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is this really tight Italian </v>

3392
02:29:12.160 --> 02:29:12.560
<v Speaker 1>community in Pennsylvania.</v>

3393
02:29:12.560 --> 02:29:17.560
<v Speaker 1>They Lard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were all overweight and none of </v>

3394
02:29:17.560 --> 02:29:17.560
<v Speaker 1>them were dying of heart disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were all dying of old age.</v>

3395
02:29:17.560 --> 02:29:21.670
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only thing they can isolate it was </v>

3396
02:29:21.670 --> 02:29:23.831
<v Speaker 1>the fact that they were such a tight </v>
<v Speaker 1>loving community that then maybe they </v>

3397
02:29:23.831 --> 02:29:25.280
<v Speaker 1>come from a really strong genetic stock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all from the same part of Italy.</v>

3398
02:29:25.490 --> 02:29:28.790
<v Speaker 1>They took guys from Rosetta and who went</v>
<v Speaker 1>to other parts of the country.</v>

3399
02:29:28.820 --> 02:29:30.620
<v Speaker 1>They were dying of heart disease at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same rate,</v>

3400
02:29:30.890 --> 02:29:32.540
<v Speaker 1>but when they were in this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>

3401
02:29:32.720 --> 02:29:36.920
<v Speaker 1>they had such a strong tight bond within</v>
<v Speaker 1>that community and so much support.</v>

3402
02:29:37.370 --> 02:29:40.110
<v Speaker 1>They were just happy people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were just happy people.</v>

3403
02:29:40.140 --> 02:29:45.140
<v Speaker 1>It totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a physical aspect of human </v>

3404
02:29:45.140 --> 02:29:45.140
<v Speaker 1>interaction that there's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a reaction,</v>

3405
02:29:45.140 --> 02:29:49.961
<v Speaker 1>there's something happening and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>a need for it to the point where they </v>

3406
02:29:49.961 --> 02:29:50.360
<v Speaker 1>punish people in prison,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but taking it away from them.</v>

3407
02:29:50.420 --> 02:29:52.160
<v Speaker 1>If you don't touch a baby when they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they're,</v>

3408
02:29:52.220 --> 02:29:54.320
<v Speaker 1>when they're between zero and one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will die.</v>

3409
02:29:54.321 --> 02:29:59.321
<v Speaker 1>It's called failure to thrive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hospitals have to have people come by </v>

3410
02:29:59.321 --> 02:30:03.461
<v Speaker 1>and hold the babies you cannot have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They used to have an orphanage is they </v>

3411
02:30:03.461 --> 02:30:06.311
<v Speaker 1>put a baby and they wouldn't touch it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they didn't want to give it a </v>

3412
02:30:06.311 --> 02:30:06.311
<v Speaker 1>disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did that.</v>

3413
02:30:06.311 --> 02:30:07.820
<v Speaker 1>The baby would die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's called failure to thrive.</v>

3414
02:30:07.860 --> 02:30:12.350
<v Speaker 1>You don't hold the baby for a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of time during the day.</v>

3415
02:30:12.560 --> 02:30:14.600
<v Speaker 1>They will die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Completely believed.</v>

3416
02:30:14.601 --> 02:30:18.690
<v Speaker 1>That totally makes sense that we don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to accept it as a.</v>

3417
02:30:18.691 --> 02:30:23.690
<v Speaker 1>it's an actual tangible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>measurable sort of a feeling or a thing,</v>

3418

<v Speaker 3>it's.</v>

3673
02:40:37.050 --> 02:40:41.130
<v Speaker 3>It's almost impossible to do and not be </v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous.</v>

3674
02:40:41.131 --> 02:40:43.230
<v Speaker 3>What have you seen that you love besides</v>
<v Speaker 3>les miserables?</v>

<v Speaker 3>injected into my asshole with a laser </v>

3676
02:40:50.131 --> 02:40:51.030
<v Speaker 3>beam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't.</v>

3677
02:40:51.090 --> 02:40:56.090
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't watch on the screen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to experience it through my </v>

3678
02:40:56.090 --> 02:40:56.090
<v Speaker 3>central nervous system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>asshole first.</v>

3679
02:40:56.850 --> 02:40:57.880
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love you.</v>

3680
02:40:58.030 --> 02:41:01.440
<v Speaker 3>I came,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I came in my own mouth.</v>

3681
02:41:01.500 --> 02:41:02.780
<v Speaker 3>It's my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my calm.</v>

3682
02:41:02.820 --> 02:41:05.910
<v Speaker 3>I opened my mouth and it was like </v>
<v Speaker 3>crescendo.</v>

3683
02:41:06.160 --> 02:41:11.160
<v Speaker 3>The jet came out of my cock that was the</v>
<v Speaker 3>exact shape of my mouth on the inside </v>

3684
02:41:12.271 --> 02:41:16.920
<v Speaker 3>and it went in seamlessly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was an air tight airtight seal gallon</v>

3685
02:41:16.950 --> 02:41:19.220
<v Speaker 3>of calm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just like,</v>

3686
02:41:19.250 --> 02:41:24.250
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a wiffle ball bat suspended from </v>

3687
02:41:24.250 --> 02:41:26.430
<v Speaker 3>the tip of my dick out in a fan shape of</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mouth and went right in the hole.</v>

3688
02:41:27.240 --> 02:41:32.240
<v Speaker 3>You haven't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to sit through a fucking </v>

3689
02:41:32.240 --> 02:41:32.240
<v Speaker 3>musical.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One time I remember you told me what was</v>

3690
02:41:32.240 --> 02:41:32.240
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

3691
02:41:32.240 --> 02:41:33.550
<v Speaker 3>it was a murderer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Attention on my murders,</v>

3692
02:41:33.580 --> 02:41:36.010
<v Speaker 3>assault my attention span.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3693
02:41:36.180 --> 02:41:40.290
<v Speaker 3>I had a friend that was a in a musical </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we all went and we watched the first</v>

3694
02:41:40.291 --> 02:41:42.240
<v Speaker 3>half and then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you guys think?</v>

3695
02:41:42.510 --> 02:41:43.470
<v Speaker 3>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3696
02:41:43.471 --> 02:41:46.200
<v Speaker 3>I think she's doing a really great job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but think it was awesome.</v>

3697
02:41:46.560 --> 02:41:51.560
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was a fucking murderers assault on </v>

3698
02:41:51.560 --> 02:41:51.750
<v Speaker 3>your attention span.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How dare you pretend you'd like that?</v>

3699
02:41:51.900 --> 02:41:54.990
<v Speaker 3>Nobody could possibly like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're watching nonsense,</v>

3700
02:41:54.991 --> 02:41:58.200
<v Speaker 3>you're watching songs that suck for no </v>
<v Speaker 3>reason.</v>

3701
02:41:58.201 --> 02:42:01.440
<v Speaker 3>Someone's singing songs for no reason </v>
<v Speaker 3>and those songs are fucking terrible.</v>

3702
02:42:01.710 --> 02:42:04.380
<v Speaker 3>This shit doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shut your mouth.</v>

3703
02:42:04.400 --> 02:42:05.620
<v Speaker 3>You shut your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not enjoying it.</v>

3704
02:42:05.740 --> 02:42:10.740
<v Speaker 3>It'd be weird if I started singing now </v>
<v Speaker 3>to tell you she's what?</v>

<v Speaker 3>when I eat.</v>

3707
02:42:18.140 --> 02:42:21.930

<v Speaker 3>sudden the guy starts to sing.</v>

<v Speaker 3>head for so many years because it was so</v>

3741
02:43:37.621 --> 02:43:40.110
<v Speaker 3>bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like show tunes though.</v>

<v Speaker 3>musical.</v>

3765
02:44:45.160 --> 02:44:46.870
<v Speaker 3>There was a lot of musical elements to </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

3766
02:44:46.871 --> 02:44:51.871

<v Speaker 3>lot of acting sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even like the book of Mormon.</v>

3768
02:44:51.881 --> 02:44:55.430
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that the one where Sean Penn got </v>
<v Speaker 3>really mad at them for making fun of a.</v>

<v Speaker 3>He's a fucking actor.</v>

3773
02:45:03.430 --> 02:45:06.280
<v Speaker 3>There's no getting around that man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The best actors,</v>

3774
02:45:06.281 --> 02:45:11.281
<v Speaker 3>the most,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the coolest ones to hang out with are </v>

3775
02:45:11.281 --> 02:45:11.590
<v Speaker 3>still not nearly as interesting as your </v>
<v Speaker 3>average landscaper.</v>

3776
02:45:11.820 --> 02:45:12.980
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So fact,</v>

3777
02:45:12.990 --> 02:45:14.590
<v Speaker 3>why am I podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never have actors.</v>

3778
02:45:14.591 --> 02:45:15.950
<v Speaker 3>I always want to have like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3779
02:45:16.390 --> 02:45:21.390
<v Speaker 3>other people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like somebody who writes a book or a or </v>

3780
02:45:21.390 --> 02:45:21.390
<v Speaker 3>a soldier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

3781
02:45:21.390 --> 02:45:21.390
<v Speaker 3>Somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lawyer,</v>

3782
02:45:21.390 --> 02:45:22.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's more interesting to me.</v>

3783
02:45:22.410 --> 02:45:27.410
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I remember I was listening to an </v>

3784
02:45:27.410 --> 02:45:27.410
<v Speaker 3>interview and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Brad Pitt's an awesome actor,</v>

3785
02:45:27.410 --> 02:45:28.240
<v Speaker 3>no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was like I was listening,</v>

3786
02:45:28.241 --> 02:45:31.210
<v Speaker 3>I was like on CNN and I wasn't paying </v>
<v Speaker 3>attention on care and I was like,</v>

3787
02:45:31.211 --> 02:45:34.740
<v Speaker 3>who is this idiot that Larry King's </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to Brad attack?</v>

3788
02:45:36.220 --> 02:45:37.930
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean he's going to make them </v>
<v Speaker 3>believe.</v>

3789
02:45:37.931 --> 02:45:41.680
<v Speaker 3>And that's what it doesn't mean he's got</v>
<v Speaker 3>charisma is great to look at.</v>

3790
02:45:41.681 --> 02:45:43.960
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't mean I'm going to listen to </v>
<v Speaker 3>his point of view on life.</v>

3791
02:45:43.961 --> 02:45:46.660
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what also I think that the,</v>

3792
02:45:46.780 --> 02:45:49.960
<v Speaker 3>the ability to transform yourself into </v>
<v Speaker 3>another person like you know,</v>

3793
02:45:51.040 --> 02:45:56.040
<v Speaker 3>doesn't necessarily lend itself to you </v>
<v Speaker 3>being in an eloquent public speaker and </v>

3794
02:45:56.531 --> 02:45:58.750
<v Speaker 3>representative of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of your craft.</v>

3795
02:45:58.900 --> 02:46:00.730
<v Speaker 3>A little.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Probably a Weirdos like,</v>

3796
02:46:01.820 --> 02:46:06.820
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you mean because Daniel Day Lewis lived </v>

3797
02:46:06.820 --> 02:46:06.850
<v Speaker 3>in a log cabin with no electricity </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the whole time he shot Lincoln.</v>

3798
02:46:07.180 --> 02:46:12.180
<v Speaker 3>Hey Dude still sucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's gotta suck when you do that,</v>

3799
02:46:13.340 --> 02:46:18.340
<v Speaker 3>when you spend so much time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Still the fucking shit out of him with </v>

3800
02:46:18.340 --> 02:46:22.640
<v Speaker 3>the box.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We trained for three years to be a </v>

3801
02:46:22.640 --> 02:46:22.640

3802
02:46:22.640 --> 02:46:22.640
<v Speaker 3>I got good and I watched.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3803
02:46:22.640 --> 02:46:26.171

<v Speaker 3>you could've done the movie without </v>

3804

<v Speaker 3>being a boxer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Actually it wasn't.</v>

3805
02:46:26.171 --> 02:46:26.360
<v Speaker 3>It wasn't that it wasn't like the </v>
<v Speaker 3>deciding factor,</v>

3806

<v Speaker 3>why do you lose weight or you've put </v>

3809
