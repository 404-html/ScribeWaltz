<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

20
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.200
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

21
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.540
<v Speaker 1>That's the episode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tremendous.</v>

22
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.830
<v Speaker 1>Haiti,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

23
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.960
<v Speaker 1>This is [inaudible] 86 to seven percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>on Miami.</v>

24
00:01:03.961 --> 00:01:06.570
<v Speaker 1>This is way before American gangster was</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about it.</v>

25
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.823
<v Speaker 1>This was already out that they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing Vietnam heroin and dead bodies </v>

26
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.080
<v Speaker 1>and that's how the episode starts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>report.</v>

27
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.190
<v Speaker 1>It takes Don Johnson to the morgue and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he opens it up from Vietnam and he goes,</v>

28
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.330
<v Speaker 1>this is your friend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stick your hand,</v>

29
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.470
<v Speaker 1>and it was just pure heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was what they did,</v>

30
00:01:22.471 --> 00:01:23.700
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they were doing towards.</v>

31
00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know at the beginning that was,</v>

32
00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:28.530
<v Speaker 1>but it was really the CIA that blaming </v>
<v Speaker 1>it all on some black guy from that</v>

33
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:29.441
<v Speaker 2>Harlem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

34
00:01:29.441 --> 00:01:30.520
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a guy named Mr.</v>

35
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:31.900
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I forget what his name is.</v>

36
00:01:31.901 --> 00:01:36.520
<v Speaker 2>Something banks famous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A drug dealer when he said was,</v>

37
00:01:36.521 --> 00:01:40.000
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't the CIA.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What it was some people in the CIA.</v>

38
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.020
<v Speaker 2>He said it's some cowboys in the ca and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what makes the most sense to me.</v>

39
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.690
<v Speaker 2>Like this idea that the big </v>
<v Speaker 2>organization,</v>

40
00:01:46.691 --> 00:01:50.460
<v Speaker 2>the CIO would be involved in drug </v>
<v Speaker 2>smuggling seems like so crazy.</v>

41
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.890
<v Speaker 2>Joe Rogan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's too many,</v>

42
00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.920
<v Speaker 2>many heads,</v>
<v Speaker 2>plenty of people,</v>

43
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.570
<v Speaker 2>plenty of people that did do it look </v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

44
00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.950
<v Speaker 2>There's plenty of examples.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like there's an example right now,</v>

45
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.180
<v Speaker 2>this thing called the Silk Road,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know about the Silk Road.</v>

46
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:02.523
<v Speaker 2>The Silk Road was this underground drug </v>
<v Speaker 2>dealing like network that this guy had </v>

47
00:02:07.061 --> 00:02:09.640
<v Speaker 2>created and they were just selling mad </v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

48
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.430
<v Speaker 2>Matt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Matt drugs like underground and they had</v>

49
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.520
<v Speaker 2>created this thing like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

50
00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.013
<v Speaker 2>it's a total.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What it is is it operates like </v>

51
00:02:20.711 --> 00:02:23.830
<v Speaker 2>completely under the wire and these dea </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>

52
00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:24.723
<v Speaker 2>I think it was tea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they infiltrated it and they got into </v>

53
00:02:26.921 --> 00:02:27.370
<v Speaker 2>the Silk Road.</v>

54
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.740
<v Speaker 2>One of the first things they did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they started stealing money.</v>

55
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.080
<v Speaker 2>Now these guys are in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to jail right now.</v>

56
00:02:32.081 --> 00:02:32.914
<v Speaker 2>They're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're in court right now and they're </v>

57
00:02:33.941 --> 00:02:34.774
<v Speaker 2>wondering like whether or not this case </v>
<v Speaker 2>is even valid because these guys for </v>

58
00:02:37.841 --> 00:02:42.841
<v Speaker 2>sure had access to this guy's account </v>
<v Speaker 2>and part of what they were trying to try</v>

59
00:02:43.781 --> 00:02:44.614
<v Speaker 2>this guy on his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his complicit in that he was complicit </v>

60
00:02:47.321 --> 00:02:48.154
<v Speaker 2>in the drug selling and there was also </v>
<v Speaker 2>some possibility that people were </v>

61
00:02:50.321 --> 00:02:52.300
<v Speaker 2>murdered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although there was no body.</v>

62
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.283
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of Kinky shit going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>with this and the kinkiest part is that </v>

63
00:02:56.051 --> 00:02:58.050
<v Speaker 2>the agents were stealing money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bitcoins,</v>

64
00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.923
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were stealing of thousands of </v>

65
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.190
<v Speaker 2>dollars in bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they,</v>

66
00:03:02.191 --> 00:03:04.130
<v Speaker 2>they realized that there was a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>value in this.</v>

67
00:03:04.131 --> 00:03:04.964
<v Speaker 2>Like that shit is always gone on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the reason why you have guys </v>

68
00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:09.970
<v Speaker 2>like this that are showing up in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Silk Road case,</v>

69
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.240
<v Speaker 2>there's always been cowboys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's been good guys too.</v>

70
00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.470
<v Speaker 2>There's been guys who were in the CIA </v>
<v Speaker 2>that really did it for America.</v>

71
00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.970
<v Speaker 2>I had this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michael Baker in them.</v>

72
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty good at recognizing bullshit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

73
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:25.630
<v Speaker 2>and he's a longtime CIA operative in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking great guy.</v>

74
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:26.683
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he really does seem like he loves </v>

75
00:03:27.431 --> 00:03:29.830
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I don't think he's bullshitting.</v>

76
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.030
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a lot of those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get in those positions and they get</v>

77
00:03:34.031 --> 00:03:36.490
<v Speaker 2>a group of them together just like they </v>
<v Speaker 2>did with ramp part,</v>

78
00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.373
<v Speaker 2>but those fucking bad cops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get a group of them together and </v>

79
00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:40.930
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look what happened.</v>

80
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.310
<v Speaker 2>Oops.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pop that out.</v>

81
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:43.560
<v Speaker 2>They get together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Go look.</v>

82
00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.370
<v Speaker 2>All these guys are making money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

83
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:46.563
<v Speaker 2>Fuck them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all criminals and scumbags and </v>

84
00:03:48.131 --> 00:03:50.080
<v Speaker 2>cons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just get some of this money,</v>

00:03:54.941 --> 00:03:57.190
<v Speaker 2>We keep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we keep throwing a few of them in jail.</v>

90
00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.000
<v Speaker 2>We do whatever the fuck we got to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We were the were the gang here.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Let's fucking make some money.</v>

92
00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.810
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the CIA?</v>

93
00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.790
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't have said that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're absolutely right.</v>

94
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.610
<v Speaker 3>There was factions like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

95
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:09.513
<v Speaker 3>a brown bag,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a black bag faction that wedding </v>

96
00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:12.810
<v Speaker 3>after,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

97
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.480
<v Speaker 3>the marines would go in and they shoot </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody and throw cards.</v>

98
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.640
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck it was when you have,</v>

99
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:23.670
<v Speaker 3>when you're shipping heroin from </v>
<v Speaker 3>wherever the fuck that is considered all</v>

100
00:04:24.041 --> 00:04:24.874
<v Speaker 3>the way to the United States through </v>
<v Speaker 3>three or two different airports and </v>

101
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.490
<v Speaker 3>people have to unload them and you have </v>
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

102
00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.600
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever.</v>

103
00:04:31.601 --> 00:04:35.260
<v Speaker 3>People walk into your plane when they </v>
<v Speaker 3>first come in to inspect them.</v>

104
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.330
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot of people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to grease.</v>

105
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.233

<v Speaker 3>across with police scanners and try our </v>
<v Speaker 3>best to to make,</v>

108
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:51.910
<v Speaker 3>to infiltrate the.</v>

109
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.140
<v Speaker 3>To bring in that amount of heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to spend a lot of dough.</v>

110
00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.453
<v Speaker 3>That's where your costs come in.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where you set the wholesale and </v>

111
00:04:59.921 --> 00:05:01.600
<v Speaker 3>the retail prices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

112
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.760
<v Speaker 3>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 years ago,</v>

113
00:05:03.761 --> 00:05:06.960
<v Speaker 3>they would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would smuggle it 60 miles and 70,</v>

114
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:07.803
<v Speaker 3>45,</v>
<v Speaker 3>50 miles in from the United States </v>

115
00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:10.744
<v Speaker 3>around Miami and they would dump it </v>
<v Speaker 3>overboard with weights and 12 hours </v>

116
00:05:13.871 --> 00:05:17.830
<v Speaker 3>later the boom would explode and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bales would rise up and you'd come by,</v>

117
00:05:17.831 --> 00:05:18.664
<v Speaker 3>a fishermen will come by and put the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bales and meanwhile the dea was looking </v>

118
00:05:22.361 --> 00:05:25.420
<v Speaker 3>for that boat that was speeding across </v>
<v Speaker 3>on their radar,</v>

119
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.100
<v Speaker 3>but they would throw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

120
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.240
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that takes expensive equipment to devise</v>

121
00:05:31.241 --> 00:05:34.060
<v Speaker 3>something to throw you 50 pounds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>cocaine,</v>

122
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.500
<v Speaker 3>100 feet under the water.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then 12 hours later everything blows</v>

123
00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.550
<v Speaker 3>and your coke rises to the top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And now some guy comes and just picks it</v>

124
00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:42.700
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>

125
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.660
<v Speaker 3>This is brilliant stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this is what the Jay listens.</v>

126
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:48.100
<v Speaker 3>Really what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was one of the things.</v>

127
00:05:48.101 --> 00:05:51.370
<v Speaker 3>They get old after a while to beat the </v>
<v Speaker 3>federal government.</v>

128
00:05:51.371 --> 00:05:52.510
<v Speaker 3>You got to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got.</v>

129
00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.650
<v Speaker 3>And it doesn't listen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

130
00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.520
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

131
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.430
<v Speaker 3>what the budget is for fighting drugs </v>
<v Speaker 3>and what a drug dealer spends a month.</v>

132
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:02.070
<v Speaker 3>I'm talking about a guy that's bringing </v>
<v Speaker 3>in a thousand kilos a month,</v>

133
00:06:02.071 --> 00:06:05.300
<v Speaker 3>the powder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it be heroin or cocaine,</v>

134
00:06:05.301 --> 00:06:06.134
<v Speaker 3>that's big powder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody has got to be turning around </v>

135
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:13.670
<v Speaker 3>and they were flooding the market with </v>
<v Speaker 3>heroin and I remember being a little boy</v>

136
00:06:13.671 --> 00:06:14.504
<v Speaker 3>in New York and going to visit my </v>
<v Speaker 3>godmother and my mother's friends and </v>

137
00:06:17.541 --> 00:06:20.960
<v Speaker 3>seeing people everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not early.</v>

138
00:06:20.961 --> 00:06:23.330
<v Speaker 3>New York to me was a fucking this shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>that they.</v>

139
00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:28.340
<v Speaker 3>What's the show now where people dead </v>
<v Speaker 3>walking around Atlanta walking and I saw</v>

140
00:06:28.401 --> 00:06:32.360
<v Speaker 3>that growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw that growing up as a kid row where</v>

141
00:06:32.361 --> 00:06:35.330
<v Speaker 3>they used to have in Harlem,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Spanish Harlem.</v>

142
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.640
<v Speaker 3>Harlem is scarier than all those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

143
00:06:37.641 --> 00:06:39.440
<v Speaker 3>they had people not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not the lights.</v>

144
00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:42.080
<v Speaker 3>People waiting to cross the street and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they not at the fucking lie.</v>

145
00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.550
<v Speaker 2>They don't have though in New York that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have here in La and New York.</v>

146
00:06:45.551 --> 00:06:49.660
<v Speaker 2>All these cities of buildings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like these streets have there.</v>

147
00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:51.160
<v Speaker 2>Whether these were.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people are.</v>

148
00:06:51.161 --> 00:06:53.770
<v Speaker 2>It's like these are places where other </v>
<v Speaker 2>folks go like,</v>

149
00:06:53.771 --> 00:06:55.830
<v Speaker 2>you got all your homeless people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got,</v>

150
00:06:55.831 --> 00:06:56.501
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

151
00:06:56.501 --> 00:06:57.730
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your poor people.</v>

152
00:06:57.731 --> 00:07:01.030
<v Speaker 2>But there's cars that go through those </v>
<v Speaker 2>areas and it's,</v>

153
00:07:01.031 --> 00:07:01.864
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's well traveled like New York blends </v>

154
00:07:03.611 --> 00:07:04.444
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>La has these blocks that are just </v>

155
00:07:06.851 --> 00:07:09.670
<v Speaker 2>homeless people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when I mean just homeless people,</v>

156
00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:10.983
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they're literally might be a </v>

157
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:17.950
<v Speaker 2>thousand pounds on this block.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Dude.</v>

158
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:18.843
<v Speaker 2>You've seen them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

159
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:19.953
<v Speaker 2>You get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you make a wrong turn and you get right </v>

160
00:07:21.491 --> 00:07:23.860
<v Speaker 2>in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a Michael Jackson video.</v>

161
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.750
<v Speaker 2>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's insane.</v>

162
00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:27.950
<v Speaker 2>In downtown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a.</v>

163
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.173
<v Speaker 2>well they call skid row.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually says if you go on Google </v>

164
00:07:31.031 --> 00:07:31.864
<v Speaker 2>maps and type skid row in Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it actually says skid row and there's a </v>

165
00:07:34.811 --> 00:07:35.950
<v Speaker 2>like a mile long.</v>

166
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:39.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a couple blocks launch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot.</v>

167
00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:41.950
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's more than one area.</v>

168
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:43.053
<v Speaker 2>There's like one long street.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But we used to work when we did fear </v>

169
00:07:45.311 --> 00:07:46.144
<v Speaker 2>factor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we used to work in these buildings and </v>

170
00:07:48.101 --> 00:07:48.934
<v Speaker 2>these buildings were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them abandoned textile </v>

171
00:07:50.411 --> 00:07:51.244
<v Speaker 2>buildings or they were renting amount.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're American apparel actually is </v>

172
00:07:54.401 --> 00:07:55.270
<v Speaker 2>made.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really weird.</v>

173
00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.313
<v Speaker 2>We were in the American apparel factory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had to go through the American </v>

174
00:07:58.871 --> 00:07:59.704
<v Speaker 2>apparel factory to the get to the roof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've watched them like make their </v>

175
00:08:01.991 --> 00:08:03.010
<v Speaker 2>clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

176
00:08:03.011 --> 00:08:04.840
<v Speaker 2>they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do make them in downtown La.</v>

177
00:08:04.841 --> 00:08:06.610
<v Speaker 2>It's like one of the things they pride </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves on.</v>

178
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:07.473
<v Speaker 2>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck.</v>

179
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:09.080
<v Speaker 2>Fucking frys Joey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

180
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.120
<v Speaker 2>But we would go to the top of these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

181
00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.800
<v Speaker 2>hang up on a Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He checked into the fucking is the.</v>

182
00:08:17.801 --> 00:08:19.180
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's all right.</v>

183
00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:22.150
<v Speaker 2>We would go to the top of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>buildings and you could,</v>

184
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.130
<v Speaker 2>you could literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was areas where,</v>

185
00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could see them like leaking out into</v>

186
00:08:26.651 --> 00:08:29.890
<v Speaker 2>the rest is treats and if you drove down</v>
<v Speaker 2>there who drove down the street,</v>

187
00:08:29.891 --> 00:08:31.930
<v Speaker 2>I'm not bullshitting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would see hundreds,</v>

188
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.230
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of homeless people just </v>
<v Speaker 2>swarming the streets.</v>

189
00:08:35.410 --> 00:08:38.230
<v Speaker 2>And there's these areas where they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

190
00:08:38.231 --> 00:08:40.480
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crazy.</v>

191
00:08:40.481 --> 00:08:41.271
<v Speaker 2>Joey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

192
00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:42.104
<v Speaker 2>they have these areas where they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>like they give them food or they have </v>

193
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.010
<v Speaker 2>areas where they can get medical </v>
<v Speaker 2>assistance,</v>

194
00:08:48.011 --> 00:08:50.740
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those areas are particularly dense.</v>

195
00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:51.743
<v Speaker 3>Now when I shot Myp,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the blue eye shadow at a downtown </v>

196
00:08:54.391 --> 00:08:56.050
<v Speaker 3>location,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the pool hall kind</v>

197
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:58.800
<v Speaker 1>of shorter and they had time to homeless</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

198
00:08:58.801 --> 00:08:59.634
<v Speaker 1>When I was standing there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I heard people going in talking about </v>

199
00:09:02.011 --> 00:09:05.790
<v Speaker 1>how they had day rentals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government would pay for 15 days and</v>

200
00:09:05.791 --> 00:09:08.640
<v Speaker 1>they'd be out in the street for 15 days </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

201
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.830
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't see that look advil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

202
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.760
<v Speaker 1>this seems mild compared to what I saw.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When was this?</v>

203
00:09:14.761 --> 00:09:18.420
<v Speaker 1>What year is this come?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they've cleaned it up a little.</v>

204
00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:18.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

205
00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:20.730
<v Speaker 1>It's also during the day I've gotten </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the night.</v>

206
00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Curious.</v>

207
00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:24.710
<v Speaker 1>Go back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

208
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.553
<v Speaker 1>I want to see what the statistics were </v>
<v Speaker 1>good people in every city and it's out </v>

209
00:09:30.481 --> 00:09:32.490
<v Speaker 1>of proportion and some cities more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

210
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:35.970
<v Speaker 1>Pause on that for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Skid row's near downtown La.</v>

211
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:36.803
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand sensors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The population of the district was </v>

212
00:09:37.531 --> 00:09:40.990
<v Speaker 1>7,740.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Skid row is defined as,</v>

213
00:09:41.370 --> 00:09:43.410
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck does that mean?</v>

214
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:47.680
<v Speaker 1>Does it defined in a decision by Jones </v>
<v Speaker 1>versus city of Los Angeles?</v>

215
00:09:47.710 --> 00:09:48.543
<v Speaker 1>The area east of main street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>south of Third Street and west of </v>

216
00:09:51.211 --> 00:09:53.310
<v Speaker 1>Alameda Street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's kind of like a block.</v>

217
00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:57.090
<v Speaker 1>It's like an area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that area has 17,000</v>

218
00:09:57.091 --> 00:09:58.650
<v Speaker 1>homeless people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that right?</v>

219
00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.200
<v Speaker 1>That's a Goddamn Kevin Hart concert.</v>

220
00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:07.890
<v Speaker 1>That's Kevin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kevin,</v>

221
00:10:07.950 --> 00:10:09.810
<v Speaker 1>Kevin Hart sold out Madison Square </v>
<v Speaker 1>Garden.</v>

222
00:10:09.811 --> 00:10:12.440
<v Speaker 1>Three fucking shows in a row.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a monster.</v>

223
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:13.780
<v Speaker 1>Comedies on and off time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

224
00:10:14.730 --> 00:10:16.860
<v Speaker 1>She's the biggest comedian of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kevin.</v>

225
00:10:16.861 --> 00:10:19.680
<v Speaker 1>No one's ever been as big as Kevin Hart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As far as like popularity.</v>

226
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.200
<v Speaker 1>No one even close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't think of one person.</v>

227
00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:24.720
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a couple of guys that </v>
<v Speaker 1>got up to that edge,</v>

228
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:27.330
<v Speaker 1>but I think he's totally taken it to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally different stratosphere.</v>

229
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:29.310
<v Speaker 1>Like Dane got pretty far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got on that edge,</v>

230
00:10:29.610 --> 00:10:30.443
<v Speaker 1>louise on that edge,</v>

245
00:11:15.001 --> 00:11:19.270
<v Speaker 1>and being like the back that can not be </v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoyable hearing screens,</v>

246
00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.333
<v Speaker 1>huge screens and the way they </v>
<v Speaker 1>acoustically setup these things used to </v>

247
00:11:22.951 --> 00:11:24.660
<v Speaker 1>be a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

248
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:27.330
<v Speaker 1>I told you that I used to work at great </v>
<v Speaker 1>woods,</v>

249
00:11:27.630 --> 00:11:29.930
<v Speaker 1>is kind of a funny story because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

250
00:11:29.970 --> 00:11:33.390
<v Speaker 1>it was during a bill cosby show that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was an issue there,</v>

251
00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:36.450
<v Speaker 1>a bill cosby and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was uh,</v>

252
00:11:36.451 --> 00:11:38.910
<v Speaker 1>a Rodney dangerfield show the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>

253
00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:41.710
<v Speaker 1>And the issue was the way great woods is</v>
<v Speaker 1>set up,</v>

254
00:11:42.010 --> 00:11:42.843
<v Speaker 1>it's an amphitheater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you're indoors and part of it and </v>

255
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:45.863
<v Speaker 1>part of it is outdoors in the back of it</v>
<v Speaker 1>leads out to this like lawn area or at </v>

256
00:11:49.951 --> 00:11:51.060
<v Speaker 1>least did when I worked there.</v>

257
00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:54.250
<v Speaker 1>And so you can hear if were under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>canopy,</v>

258
00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:58.120
<v Speaker 1>there was like an acoustic canopy above </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the seats in the front.</v>

259
00:11:58.270 --> 00:11:59.103
<v Speaker 1>But then the back there was no seats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's like you had monsters behind </v>

260
00:12:02.501 --> 00:12:04.030
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he tried to watch a show.</v>

261
00:12:04.031 --> 00:12:07.530
<v Speaker 1>Like there was one big fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I want to say it was,</v>

262
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:12.160
<v Speaker 1>it was Judas priest was a Judas priest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

263
00:12:12.161 --> 00:12:12.994
<v Speaker 1>jethro tull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was jethro Tull was a jethro tull </v>

264
00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:19.590
<v Speaker 1>concert and there was a fucking mad riot</v>
<v Speaker 1>because people started lighting fires up</v>

265
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:20.583
<v Speaker 1>in the hood up in the grass area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were just lighting fires and there </v>

266
00:12:24.311 --> 00:12:25.144
<v Speaker 1>was not enough of us to sort of control </v>
<v Speaker 1>it all because it was getting really </v>

267
00:12:28.571 --> 00:12:31.270
<v Speaker 1>fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I put my security jacket,</v>

268
00:12:31.271 --> 00:12:33.820
<v Speaker 1>I put a Hoodie on over my security </v>
<v Speaker 1>jacket,</v>

269
00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:36.220
<v Speaker 1>zipped it up through the Hoodie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over my head and said,</v>

<v Speaker 1>fuck this job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I just quit.</v>

271

<v Speaker 1>you can't pay me nine bucks an hour to </v>

272
00:12:40.481 --> 00:12:43.540
<v Speaker 1>get killed because this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking madness.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I am God.</v>

279

<v Speaker 1>constitute because he breaks up the </v>

281
00:13:01.811 --> 00:13:05.000
<v Speaker 1>flute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>breaks up the flow.</v>

284
00:13:08.761 --> 00:13:09.594
<v Speaker 1>stuff like we don't like flutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My point was in the backyard of the </v>

285
00:13:12.101 --> 00:13:14.350
<v Speaker 1>green,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the green grass area,</v>

286

<v Speaker 1>you couldn't hear the words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't understand what the fuck it </v>

287
00:13:17.141 --> 00:13:18.400
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was all echos.</v>

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:21.370
<v Speaker 1>Like people were pissed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go,</v>

291

<v Speaker 1>and Ronnie was killing too,</v>

292
00:13:24.041 --> 00:13:25.650
<v Speaker 1>and so it was caused because he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed.</v>

293
00:13:25.651 --> 00:13:26.484
<v Speaker 1>We were just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie and I would talk on about a red </v>

<v Speaker 1>which is a little smaller.</v>

298
00:13:43.661 --> 00:13:46.870
<v Speaker 1>I think on the other side of the Denver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had an issue there,</v>

299
00:13:46.871 --> 00:13:51.871

<v Speaker 1>He put his name on the bill like you </v>

<v Speaker 1>They had his name in the lineup.</v>

321
00:14:45.791 --> 00:14:47.500
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like a guest set or anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

322
00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:51.590
<v Speaker 1>It was a guy they had scheduled on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show and nobody wants to go first.</v>

323
00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:53.960
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to go up first in front </v>
<v Speaker 1>of fucking 15,000</v>

324
00:14:53.961 --> 00:14:54.230
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

<v Speaker 1>first.</v>

326
00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.000
<v Speaker 1>Brody had to go up there and do the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardest spot of the night.</v>

327
00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:00.063
<v Speaker 1>Was second hardest spot of the night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hardest by the night is like </v>

328
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:04.200
<v Speaker 1>following someone who crushes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're going on after Diaz,</v>

329
00:15:04.210 --> 00:15:06.260
<v Speaker 1>that's the hardest part of the night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but any.</v>

330
00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:09.680
<v Speaker 1>The second hardest part of the hardest </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the night is the first guy,</v>

331
00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:10.723
<v Speaker 1>the first guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his first couple of minutes is kind of </v>

332
00:15:11.901 --> 00:15:14.750
<v Speaker 1>like a throwaway and you've got to kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of get everybody loose,</v>

333
00:15:14.930 --> 00:15:17.090
<v Speaker 1>get everybody feeling good and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>boom,</v>

334
00:15:17.091 --> 00:15:20.330
<v Speaker 1>hit them in the material that has got to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have very few bumps in it because you're</v>

335
00:15:20.331 --> 00:15:23.130
<v Speaker 1>trying to hypnotize these fuckers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like the early material,</v>

336
00:15:23.131 --> 00:15:26.330
<v Speaker 1>it's gotta be like real smooth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more herky Jerky,</v>

337
00:15:26.331 --> 00:15:29.600
<v Speaker 1>the earlier stuff is less likely to </v>
<v Speaker 1>trust you.</v>

338
00:15:29.601 --> 00:15:30.434
<v Speaker 1>You motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't even get me into Goddamn </v>

340
00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:34.593

<v Speaker 1>We never heard about like mental illness</v>

383
00:17:15.801 --> 00:17:19.700
<v Speaker 1>when I heard about like completely crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that were locked in an asylum.</v>

384
00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:23.990
<v Speaker 1>But the idea of like your aunt taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>pills because she's bipolar,</v>

385
00:17:23.991 --> 00:17:26.390

<v Speaker 1>everyone knows like,</v>

388
00:17:32.031 --> 00:17:34.490
<v Speaker 1>I think you just get used to people </v>
<v Speaker 1>being fucking crazy.</v>

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.170
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You didn't feel like you had to medicate</v>

<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

391
00:17:36.801 --> 00:17:39.410
<v Speaker 1>I think people were way more crazy in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sixties and seventies.</v>

392
00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:41.930
<v Speaker 1>I'd do Johnny Reid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to kill himself,</v>

393
00:17:41.931 --> 00:17:44.210
<v Speaker 1>but he jumped off a building.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Atlanta in the dumpster.</v>

394
00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.860
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how bad was he?</v>

395
00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:50.010
<v Speaker 1>Broken?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucked up.</v>

396
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:51.653
<v Speaker 3>Fucked up and he throw punches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Johnny Reid was a trip and he got a </v>

397
00:17:59.071 --> 00:18:02.000
<v Speaker 3>check from the government and he gave it</v>
<v Speaker 3>to you first.</v>

398
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:03.623
<v Speaker 3>That's what people thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he lives like he banged his head on </v>

399
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:09.780
<v Speaker 3>a dumpster on my fucking dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He lived and he gives his check from the</v>

400
00:18:09.781 --> 00:18:10.614
<v Speaker 3>government and the first to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bartender and he torment the bartender </v>

401
00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:16.110
<v Speaker 3>to that check was done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they throw them after the first and</v>

402
00:18:16.111 --> 00:18:18.300
<v Speaker 3>they will last a little about the 18th </v>
<v Speaker 3>and 19th.</v>

403
00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:20.770
<v Speaker 3>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I met Johnny Ray.</v>

404
00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.990
<v Speaker 3>He through an east coast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He locked the bathroom from the APP.</v>

405
00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:29.620
<v Speaker 3>You liked the bathrooms and the outside </v>
<v Speaker 3>of these coasts.</v>

406
00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:32.590
<v Speaker 3>When you leave a bar at night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when they close up,</v>

407
00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:36.280
<v Speaker 3>they locked the bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then they put like a lock box.</v>

408
00:18:36.281 --> 00:18:37.440
<v Speaker 3>Have you break in?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't.</v>

409
00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.910
<v Speaker 3>He would go into the bathroom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Johnny [inaudible] like 11:00</v>

410
00:18:39.911 --> 00:18:41.440
<v Speaker 3>in the morning that we lock them in </v>
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>

411
00:18:41.450 --> 00:18:43.330
<v Speaker 3>We leave them in there until like 6:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>at night.</v>

412
00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.140
<v Speaker 3>We come back to have a drink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd open the bathroom and he'd come out</v>

413
00:18:47.141 --> 00:18:49.210
<v Speaker 3>like nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I swear to God like nothing happened.</v>

414
00:18:49.810 --> 00:18:50.643
<v Speaker 3>He was hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One day put my Dick on a chair next to </v>

<v Speaker 3>see what happens,</v>

416
00:19:00.601 --> 00:19:01.710

<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

417
00:19:01.711 --> 00:19:06.330
<v Speaker 3>And he just got up thought Johnny </v>
<v Speaker 3>relived like maybe 12 years ago.</v>

418
00:19:06.331 --> 00:19:07.164
<v Speaker 3>We used to give them bumps at coke and </v>
<v Speaker 3>get them riled up at the bar and they </v>

419
00:19:09.661 --> 00:19:11.200
<v Speaker 3>just leave.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are you talking about?</v>

503
00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:51.410
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

504
00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:54.380
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I was like,</v>

505
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:56.930
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't even make out with her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt I couldn't do anything.</v>

506
00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:59.570
<v Speaker 3>I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just remember going home and going,</v>

507
00:22:59.571 --> 00:23:01.520
<v Speaker 3>I can't see this girl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

508
00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:02.383
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how come you couldn't just thought and </v>

509
00:23:05.010 --> 00:23:07.510
<v Speaker 3>had never entered my mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was just too sad.</v>

510
00:23:07.870 --> 00:23:10.580
<v Speaker 3>It was too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was mind boggling,</v>

511
00:23:10.581 --> 00:23:15.050
<v Speaker 3>like not having a mom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I called her up one day and I stopped</v>

512
00:23:15.051 --> 00:23:17.390
<v Speaker 3>dating her and I started dating the </v>
<v Speaker 3>southern Irish chicken.</v>

513
00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.580
<v Speaker 3>I never thought about or again,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

514
00:23:19.581 --> 00:23:24.350
<v Speaker 3>I know she was mad and then uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my mother died and I was like,</v>

515
00:23:24.351 --> 00:23:26.660
<v Speaker 3>that's the first person I thought it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>this poor girl.</v>

516
00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.150
<v Speaker 3>Like I knew what she fucking felt like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

517
00:23:29.151 --> 00:23:29.984
<v Speaker 3>I never,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could never imagine that pain when I </v>

518
00:23:32.421 --> 00:23:33.900
<v Speaker 3>was dating him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when she told me like,</v>

519
00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:36.620
<v Speaker 3>what are you fucking talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your mom dies.</v>

520
00:23:36.980 --> 00:23:41.000
<v Speaker 3>My fucking mom dies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the worst thing I've had.</v>

521
00:23:41.001 --> 00:23:41.834
<v Speaker 3>I think one of my girlfriends died,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the girls I dated earlier on </v>

522
00:23:45.290 --> 00:23:45.980
<v Speaker 3>about two years</v>

523
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:47.570
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm still friends with her brother.</v>

524
00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:50.150
<v Speaker 2>We didn't really date.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We messed around a little bit.</v>

525
00:23:50.151 --> 00:23:54.070
<v Speaker 2>She was fucking crazy and she ended up </v>
<v Speaker 2>dying from pills and booze.</v>

526
00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.840
<v Speaker 2>Nobody really know Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We started off with guns.</v>

527
00:23:56.841 --> 00:23:57.674
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we went to 10 times before they asked </v>

528
00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:02.540
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of my girlfriends killed himself.</v>

529
00:24:02.541 --> 00:24:04.790
<v Speaker 2>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

530
00:24:04.791 --> 00:24:08.180
<v Speaker 2>it's weird when people that you really </v>
<v Speaker 2>care about aren't there anymore.</v>

531
00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:10.430
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird thing because they just </v>
<v Speaker 2>vanish.</v>

532
00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:15.050
<v Speaker 2>They just don't exist anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's a sadness that is just so.</v>

533
00:24:15.710 --> 00:24:17.420
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so forever,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Couldn't wait to see him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time I go to the east coast we'd </v>

544
00:24:47.961 --> 00:24:50.510
<v Speaker 2>off of it and then then we can go around</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hang out.</v>

547
00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:01.310
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I can't believe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he was like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is going on?</v>

552
00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:18.060
<v Speaker 2>A key he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had him.</v>

553
00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:21.130
<v Speaker 2>His life might have been chaotic as far </v>
<v Speaker 2>as drugs,</v>

554
00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:23.590
<v Speaker 2>but he knew exactly what everybody was </v>
<v Speaker 2>up to.</v>

555
00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.250
<v Speaker 2>He knew he just knew he was a very smart</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he came in as a sophomore because like a</v>

<v Speaker 2>crazy stretchmarks.</v>

<v Speaker 2>giant arms.</v>

732
00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:38.630
<v Speaker 2>He was massively muscular and he went to</v>
<v Speaker 2>a party one night in college.</v>

733
00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:41.840
<v Speaker 2>There was these college kids at some </v>
<v Speaker 2>college kid's mouth off to him.</v>

734
00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:45.080
<v Speaker 2>He knocked out three college kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a bowl.</v>

735
00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:47.270
<v Speaker 2>He would just charge at people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>punched up.</v>

736
00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:50.690
<v Speaker 2>He was so juiced up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was always angry.</v>

737
00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:52.550
<v Speaker 2>Like everywhere you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you like,</v>

738
00:33:52.551 --> 00:33:54.980
<v Speaker 2>looked at him like you want it to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like real nice to them.</v>

739
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:59.300
<v Speaker 2>It was like being around a crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like frothing at the mouth gorilla.</v>

740
00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:03.890
<v Speaker 2>Then I saw him years and years later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like not that many years.</v>

741
00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:04.773
<v Speaker 2>Like I was like 21,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he was probably like 22 and he </v>

742
00:34:07.311 --> 00:34:09.620
<v Speaker 2>weighed 160 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

743
00:34:09.621 --> 00:34:11.180
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck happened?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>

744
00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:12.143
<v Speaker 2>I just got off the stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just got off of it and his body </v>

745
00:34:14.121 --> 00:34:14.954
<v Speaker 2>became like a normal size,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you lose all your fluid or you lose </v>

746
00:34:17.151 --> 00:34:18.260
<v Speaker 2>your muscle also.</v>

747
00:34:18.410 --> 00:34:20.510
<v Speaker 2>But he was never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a weird guy.</v>

748
00:34:20.511 --> 00:34:21.344
<v Speaker 2>Like he didn't have big hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't like some earnie shavers dude </v>

749
00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:26.450
<v Speaker 2>or go or like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

750
00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:29.870
<v Speaker 2>it's just a big like you are your big </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking thick guy.</v>

751
00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:30.790
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

752
00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:32.390
<v Speaker 2>that's smaller hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>

753
00:34:32.570 --> 00:34:36.390
<v Speaker 2>it was all steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just taken this thing and changed it.</v>

754
00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:39.080
<v Speaker 2>Like the amount of muscle that his body </v>
<v Speaker 2>would carry around.</v>

755
00:34:39.081 --> 00:34:41.330
<v Speaker 2>It's just way more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was real weird.</v>

756
00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.660
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what the fuck he was doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>until after I was out of high school.</v>

757
00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:47.900
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just thought he was just a big,</v>

758
00:34:47.901 --> 00:34:50.810
<v Speaker 2>strong guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't in weight lifting.</v>

759
00:34:50.811 --> 00:34:53.660
<v Speaker 2>I didn't play football and in taekwondo </v>
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

760
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:56.040
<v Speaker 2>we didn't do any weight lifting like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

761
00:34:56.240 --> 00:34:59.210
<v Speaker 2>we did like some calisthenics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there was no weight lifting at all.</v>

762
00:34:59.390 --> 00:35:02.870
<v Speaker 2>So I didn't no idea like what the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>was going on with the student body.</v>

763
00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:03.943
<v Speaker 2>But seeing him when I was 21 and seeing </v>
<v Speaker 2>him like just like this deflate it </v>

764
00:35:08.510 --> 00:35:09.770
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

765
00:35:09.771 --> 00:35:11.720
<v Speaker 2>this is the weirdest shit I've ever seen</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my life.</v>

766
00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.210
<v Speaker 2>But back then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one knew what the fuck it was.</v>

767
00:35:14.330 --> 00:35:17.060
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about like 1988.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was when I was 21.</v>

768
00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:20.690
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know what that meant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't understand how he got smaller,</v>

769
00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:21.733
<v Speaker 2>like it didn't make any sense to me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I didn't know anybody that was a </v>

770
00:35:23.931 --> 00:35:25.910
<v Speaker 2>bodybuilder or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was just weird.</v>

771
00:35:26.290 --> 00:35:27.123
<v Speaker 2>It was just weird to see them small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then as I got older and started </v>

772
00:35:29.541 --> 00:35:32.600
<v Speaker 2>talking to people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially when I was working at,</v>

773
00:35:32.601 --> 00:35:33.434
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was working at Gold's gym or a </v>

774
00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:37.010
<v Speaker 2>nautilus plus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

775
00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:38.160

776
00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:40.950
<v Speaker 1>in revere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I knew this dude in there who was a,</v>

777
00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:44.010
<v Speaker 1>he was a bodybuilder and he kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>schooled me on some of it.</v>

778
00:35:44.340 --> 00:35:47.400
<v Speaker 1>I go because he was huge and I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you take steroids?</v>

779
00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:48.383
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

<v Speaker 1>fucking look at me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what do you think?</v>

781
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:54.720
<v Speaker 1>Of course I fucking take steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was the first guy I ever met that was</v>

782
00:35:54.721 --> 00:35:55.554
<v Speaker 1>like super open about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had these like he would wear like </v>

783
00:35:57.391 --> 00:35:58.224
<v Speaker 1>those daisy duke short back then </v>
<v Speaker 1>bodybuilders or were those daisy duke </v>

784
00:36:00.751 --> 00:36:01.584
<v Speaker 1>shorts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this kid had these fucking giant </v>

785
00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:07.760
<v Speaker 1>tanned legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were enormous Tangela.</v>

786
00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:10.470
<v Speaker 1>He was fucking you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope that look comes back.</v>

787
00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:14.520
<v Speaker 1>Male daisy dukes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not even coming back for girls.</v>

788
00:36:14.610 --> 00:36:15.443
<v Speaker 1>So over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think there is certain clothes </v>

789
00:36:16.411 --> 00:36:19.290
<v Speaker 1>like that that will never come back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like bottoms bell bottoms?</v>

790
00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:20.850
<v Speaker 1>I could see bell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they tried.</v>

791
00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:22.800
<v Speaker 1>They tried,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people realize it's stupid looking.</v>

792
00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:24.580
<v Speaker 1>I rocked him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

793
00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:25.423
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It worked back when people had long </v>

794
00:36:27.181 --> 00:36:29.040
<v Speaker 1>collars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See that's the difference.</v>

795
00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:32.490
<v Speaker 1>If you want to have those long collars </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they had in the sixties,</v>

796
00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:33.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like those,</v>

797
00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:38.100
<v Speaker 1>those crazy jackets that you see like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jefferson starship in those.</v>

798
00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:41.340
<v Speaker 1>And then you had platforms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People were wearing platform shoes.</v>

799
00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:42.473
<v Speaker 1>Remember those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like those all worked with the bell </v>

800
00:36:45.091 --> 00:36:46.310
<v Speaker 1>bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

801
00:36:46.350 --> 00:36:48.840
<v Speaker 1>But you get to like flip flops and bell </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottoms,</v>

802
00:36:48.841 --> 00:36:52.140
<v Speaker 1>flip flops and it gets annoying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're stepping on your bell bottoms.</v>

803
00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:53.760
<v Speaker 1>That goofy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that getting away.</v>

804
00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:55.260
<v Speaker 1>He needs stilts.</v>

805
00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:01.080
<v Speaker 3>You know what's really sad about juicing</v>
<v Speaker 3>that people that juice for a.</v>

806
00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:03.100
<v Speaker 3>What do you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Aesthetics.</v>

807
00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:05.240
<v Speaker 3>Not because they're athletic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

808
00:37:05.290 --> 00:37:10.290
<v Speaker 3>The further look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it always ends up very bad because I was</v>

809
00:37:10.571 --> 00:37:11.970
<v Speaker 3>around them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grew up around it.</v>

810
00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:15.160
<v Speaker 3>It becomes instead of snorting coke and </v>
<v Speaker 3>drinking,</v>

811
00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:16.083
<v Speaker 3>they go to steroids like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the wrestler was on and there's </v>

812
00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:20.590
<v Speaker 3>warrants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wesley and he goes to cop.</v>

813
00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:22.720
<v Speaker 3>Did you see when he caught.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see that movie.</v>

814
00:37:22.810 --> 00:37:23.580
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This apart.</v>

815
00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:28.000
<v Speaker 3>When he comes to the gym,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's copping fucking shit that they gave</v>

816
00:37:28.001 --> 00:37:30.470
<v Speaker 3>Nazis,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you know that guy,</v>

817
00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:34.340
<v Speaker 3>the ball that and you could tell it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like $2,000</v>

818
00:37:34.341 --> 00:37:35.040
<v Speaker 3>bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

819
00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.160
<v Speaker 3>what do you got right now?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

820
00:37:36.161 --> 00:37:37.780
<v Speaker 3>500,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you're giving me a restaurant.</v>

821
00:37:38.020 --> 00:37:40.510
<v Speaker 3>It was a bag.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you know that world,</v>

822
00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:43.510
<v Speaker 3>you know that for him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's a six week supply.</v>

823
00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:46.990
<v Speaker 3>That's a year supply.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then when he has his heart attack in the</v>

824
00:37:46.991 --> 00:37:48.160
<v Speaker 3>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the doctor tells him,</v>

825
00:37:48.161 --> 00:37:48.994
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bro,</v>

826
00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:50.710
<v Speaker 3>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put in your body.</v>

827
00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:53.253
<v Speaker 3>Are you fucking kidding me?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a slow death because it becomes an </v>

828
00:37:56.861 --> 00:37:58.090
<v Speaker 3>addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I saw it.</v>

829
00:37:58.091 --> 00:38:03.091
<v Speaker 3>I saw it go from once every six weeks to</v>
<v Speaker 3>four cycles a year to fuck.</v>

830
00:38:03.791 --> 00:38:06.010
<v Speaker 3>I ain't getting off it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but fuck it.</v>

831
00:38:06.011 --> 00:38:08.500
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to have a super stack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They call it stacking.</v>

832
00:38:09.010 --> 00:38:12.850
<v Speaker 3>When the next thing you know you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking fucking for things and you're not</v>

833
00:38:12.851 --> 00:38:13.684
<v Speaker 3>competing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're just going to a bar on Friday </v>

834
00:38:15.761 --> 00:38:18.640
<v Speaker 3>nights.</v>

835
00:38:18.641 --> 00:38:22.360
<v Speaker 3>I never got that and it always ends bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see those guys a year later,</v>

836
00:38:22.361 --> 00:38:24.810

<v Speaker 3>They get deflated,</v>

837
00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.760
<v Speaker 3>something happens and they go to prison </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then they can do.</v>

838
00:38:27.761 --> 00:38:28.594
<v Speaker 3>When they come and you ask them what the</v>
<v Speaker 3>tattoos or fucked up now it's always </v>

00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:20.013
<v Speaker 3>They couldn't wait to get home because </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was the second respite until it was </v>

859
00:39:23.050 --> 00:39:25.240
<v Speaker 3>going to be the biggest thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking of going home,</v>

860
00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:27.910
<v Speaker 3>taking a shower and going out because </v>

<v Speaker 3>I think it's like.</v>

867
00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:58.000
<v Speaker 3>I think it's like alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you could drink alcohol,</v>

868
00:39:58.001 --> 00:40:00.070
<v Speaker 3>you could just have a capital,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a beer at night.</v>

869
00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:00.933
<v Speaker 3>You could have a couple of glasses of </v>
<v Speaker 3>wine with dinner or you can be that </v>

<v Speaker 3>We all have met a bunch of those people.</v>

873
00:40:10.630 --> 00:40:14.320
<v Speaker 3>Some people just get addicted to shit </v>
<v Speaker 3>day drinkers.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And especially in the entertainment </v>

876
00:40:18.311 --> 00:40:19.144
<v Speaker 3>business and then we can do whatever the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck you want and nobody can tell you </v>

<v Speaker 3>Nobody tells you what to do.</v>

878
00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:26.970
<v Speaker 3>That's why you're on periscope all day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's also people that I think that,</v>

879
00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:28.300
<v Speaker 3>that did cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

880
00:40:28.301 --> 00:40:28.900
<v Speaker 3>That,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

881
00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:31.330
<v Speaker 3>that have an addiction to cocaine drink </v>
<v Speaker 3>all day because they can,</v>

882
00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:35.170

<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

883
00:40:35.171 --> 00:40:36.004
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Duke,</v>

884
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:37.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've never done it,</v>

885
00:40:37.331 --> 00:40:38.164
<v Speaker 3>but the people that have done like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of it will tell you that they </v>

886
00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:43.990
<v Speaker 3>always want to have something to calm </v>
<v Speaker 3>them down afterwards.</v>

887
00:40:44.290 --> 00:40:46.620
<v Speaker 3>Take the edge off of it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't snow in the daytime.</v>

888
00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:48.940
<v Speaker 3>I wasn't a fucking vampire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I started at night.</v>

889
00:40:49.390 --> 00:40:52.120
<v Speaker 3>It would fuck my whole day up if I even </v>
<v Speaker 3>did the line sometimes.</v>

890
00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:54.880
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to have the coke ready at 8:00,</v>

891
00:40:55.630 --> 00:40:56.463
<v Speaker 3>but sometimes I got a phone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd have the 60 bucks early in the </v>

892
00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:02.500
<v Speaker 3>daytime and I'd shoot over a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>slob.</v>

893
00:41:02.501 --> 00:41:06.130
<v Speaker 3>I go over there and take the 60,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have to hide it in my jacket.</v>

894
00:41:06.131 --> 00:41:07.920
<v Speaker 3>I have to sit there for four hours,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just coconut,</v>

895
00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:09.630
<v Speaker 3>my jacket calling me and they have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>know.</v>

896
00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:11.043
<v Speaker 3>So I would do a little bump and then get</v>
<v Speaker 3>paranoid and jerk off and fuck up my </v>

897
00:41:14.741 --> 00:41:15.574
<v Speaker 3>timing at Nih.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would fuck up my whole day so I </v>

898
00:41:17.081 --> 00:41:19.540
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't do it in the daytime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was always a nighttime guy,</v>

899
00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:21.850
<v Speaker 3>so if you didn't cook during the day </v>
<v Speaker 3>would fuck up your set.</v>

900
00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:23.710
<v Speaker 3>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It fucked up everything.</v>

901
00:41:23.770 --> 00:41:25.180
<v Speaker 3>The rest of my day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

902
00:41:25.510 --> 00:41:27.430
<v Speaker 3>my timing because my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my,</v>

903
00:41:27.450 --> 00:41:30.580
<v Speaker 3>my soul wasn't intact with my central </v>
<v Speaker 3>nervous system.</v>

904
00:41:30.970 --> 00:41:34.100
<v Speaker 3>They were apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's a part when you do blow and you</v>

905
00:41:34.101 --> 00:41:34.880
<v Speaker 3>go on stage.</v>

906
00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:36.650
<v Speaker 3>That's why I never understood that </v>
<v Speaker 3>concept.</v>

907
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:38.450
<v Speaker 3>It always made me laugh when people go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

00:41:38.451 --> 00:41:40.520
<v Speaker 3>you funny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you do coke and go on stage.</v>

909
00:41:40.550 --> 00:41:42.020
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

911
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:47.990

<v Speaker 3>I can't talk to people and I did blow.</v>

912
00:41:48.590 --> 00:41:51.680
<v Speaker 3>That's why I went to my room and hit the</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking turn the phone off.</v>

913
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:53.750
<v Speaker 3>You think I did that because I couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>talk to people.</v>

914
00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:56.000
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck you're </v>

<v Speaker 3>It doesn't work.</v>

<v Speaker 3>I started doing coke like in the </v>

00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:07.693
<v Speaker 3>eighties and I got on stage and 91 for </v>
<v Speaker 3>the first time and in [inaudible] 92 I </v>

00:42:11.631 --> 00:42:12.464
<v Speaker 3>got on stage with the guys from dendrite</v>
<v Speaker 3>to the St Patty's show and right there </v>

922
00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:20.360
<v Speaker 3>was the first time I discovered cocaine </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the stage at the boulder broker.</v>

923
00:42:20.930 --> 00:42:23.420
<v Speaker 3>I did two bumps and tried to go onstage </v>
<v Speaker 3>and be cute.</v>

924
00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:25.340
<v Speaker 3>That shit didn't work.</v>

<v Speaker 3>It didn't work.</v>

927
00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:34.220
<v Speaker 3>That was put to anybody known to do coke</v>
<v Speaker 3>and go and stand.</v>

00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:27.230
<v Speaker 3>physically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was having a nervous breakdown.</v>

946
00:43:27.231 --> 00:43:28.064
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because you think I'm fucking with you </v>

947
00:43:29.451 --> 00:43:30.600
<v Speaker 3>guys though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

948
00:43:31.730 --> 00:43:34.340
<v Speaker 3>Friday night.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I bombed so hard last week.</v>

949
00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:35.653
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes you get a transition pair and </v>

950
00:43:36.621 --> 00:43:37.454
<v Speaker 3>you've got all these bits that aren't </v>
<v Speaker 3>ready and you bring them up and it's </v>

951
00:43:39.771 --> 00:43:42.500
<v Speaker 3>like you got three of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you bomb for two weeks,</v>

952
00:43:42.770 --> 00:43:44.770
<v Speaker 3>but all of a sudden one night they all </v>
<v Speaker 3>come together.</v>

953
00:43:44.780 --> 00:43:47.480
<v Speaker 3>Now you become a force.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's a different game.</v>

954
00:43:47.481 --> 00:43:49.670
<v Speaker 3>I was in that process for like two </v>
<v Speaker 3>weeks.</v>

955
00:43:49.671 --> 00:43:51.710
<v Speaker 3>I was in limbo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had good sets in Boston,</v>

956
00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:55.410
<v Speaker 3>but anything I tried out of the ordinary</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Boston wasn't clicking for me,</v>

957
00:43:55.411 --> 00:43:56.244
<v Speaker 3>so I just stuck to the original.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I came back to the comedy </v>

958
00:43:58.821 --> 00:43:59.654
<v Speaker 3>store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ain't shit somewhere on Monday night </v>

<v Speaker 3>and I went to the academy store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thursday opened up,</v>

960
00:44:02.931 --> 00:44:05.060
<v Speaker 3>but then suicide joke that didn't take </v>
<v Speaker 3>me very far.</v>

961
00:44:07.650 --> 00:44:08.483
<v Speaker 3>And then the second time I told him the </v>
<v Speaker 3>story about my friend who tried to </v>

962
00:44:11.541 --> 00:44:12.374
<v Speaker 3>commit suicide,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she failed and she wanted to the store </v>

963
00:44:14.750 --> 00:44:18.470
<v Speaker 3>and she bought a gram of coke from Chile</v>
<v Speaker 3>and as we were doing it I said,</v>

<v Speaker 3>the vip patio and I just sit there so to</v>

1033
00:47:48.761 --> 00:47:51.000
<v Speaker 3>to listen to music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some black dude was smoking a joint.</v>

1034
00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:52.780
<v Speaker 3>I mind my business.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I look straight ahead.</v>

1035
00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:55.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm thinking about more material.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to say how I bombed.</v>

1036
00:47:56.770 --> 00:47:59.620
<v Speaker 3>It's just whipping me now and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>starting to get scared.</v>

1037
00:47:59.621 --> 00:48:04.621
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeff comes over to me.</v>

1038
00:48:04.890 --> 00:48:05.441

00:48:09.850 --> 00:48:11.020
<v Speaker 3>It's a soul.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That room,</v>

<v Speaker 3>now and she was fucking killing right?</v>

1043
00:48:25.661 --> 00:48:27.840
<v Speaker 3>She's killing Megan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Moved from whatever fucking lame is.</v>

1044
00:48:28.290 --> 00:48:29.610
<v Speaker 3>Murphy brought the dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1045
00:48:29.611 --> 00:48:31.750
<v Speaker 3>she was freaking me out and then she's </v>
<v Speaker 3>killing on stage.</v>

1046
00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:35.680
<v Speaker 3>I walk up to the first landing guys and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it hits me.</v>

1047
00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:38.170
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

1048
00:48:38.171 --> 00:48:40.570
<v Speaker 3>I'm getting anxiety attacks on 70 </v>
<v Speaker 3>milligrams.</v>

1049
00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:41.740
<v Speaker 3>Not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not.</v>

1050
00:48:41.741 --> 00:48:43.780
<v Speaker 3>This can't be happening to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This ain't happening.</v>

1051
00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:46.720
<v Speaker 3>And all of a sudden I'm standing there </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's getting worse.</v>

1052
00:48:46.721 --> 00:48:48.070
<v Speaker 3>Guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's getting worse now.</v>

1053
00:48:48.071 --> 00:48:50.020
<v Speaker 3>There's one seat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>open up the whole comedy store,</v>

1054
00:48:50.320 --> 00:48:53.800
<v Speaker 3>Mitsis Chair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I sit in there for about a minute.</v>

1055
00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:56.950
<v Speaker 3>She's got the blue light on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the pressure's on.</v>

1056
00:48:56.951 --> 00:49:00.910
<v Speaker 3>I got water in my hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I get back up and it's getting worse.</v>

1057
00:49:00.911 --> 00:49:02.110
<v Speaker 3>Guys.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I turned around,</v>

1058
00:49:02.111 --> 00:49:02.944
<v Speaker 3>I looked down to where the payphone used</v>
<v Speaker 3>to be and now I'm getting the anxiety I </v>

1059
00:49:06.611 --> 00:49:09.130
<v Speaker 3>get when I'm getting the needle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means I'm going down.</v>

1060
00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:15.700
<v Speaker 3>So I got to look for day light for air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know this,</v>

1061
00:49:15.770 --> 00:49:18.400
<v Speaker 3>I'll look for air,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I know if I go down those stairs,</v>

1062
00:49:18.401 --> 00:49:20.560
<v Speaker 3>if she calls my name and I come back up </v>
<v Speaker 3>those stairs,</v>

1063
00:49:20.561 --> 00:49:24.700
<v Speaker 3>I'm really gonna have an anxiety attack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I go to the corner and I just started</v>

1064
00:49:24.701 --> 00:49:25.534
<v Speaker 3>looking at the wall and I start </v>
<v Speaker 3>breathing through my nose and some guy </v>

1065
00:49:27.341 --> 00:49:28.000
<v Speaker 3>comes up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like,</v>

1066
00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.410

<v Speaker 3>And then he gets to hit the walkaway.</v>

1069

<v Speaker 3>Then some other guy pops out and he's </v>

00:49:50.231 --> 00:49:52.600
<v Speaker 3>I'm going down here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tell Pauli to go on stage,</v>

1078
00:49:52.601 --> 00:49:55.570
<v Speaker 3>and Jeff also wants to ask me questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like,</v>

1079
00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:56.650
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know if Paul,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I don't give a fuck.</v>

1081

1087
00:50:14.141 --> 00:50:16.380
<v Speaker 3>conversation about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Instead of Poli going,</v>

00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:18.100
<v Speaker 3>he's got an anxiety attack.</v>

<v Speaker 5>minutes.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Why would I do something like that?</v>

1107

<v Speaker 5>often than shit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Joey Diaz,</v>

1119
00:51:25.210 --> 00:51:26.043
<v Speaker 2>voice Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever had that where you were </v>

1120
00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:28.413
<v Speaker 2>like either to stoners so you just </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't feel good and you're about to go </v>

1121
00:51:30.851 --> 00:51:31.684
<v Speaker 2>on stage and you almost couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You almost don't think you could have </v>

1122
00:51:34.271 --> 00:51:35.830
<v Speaker 2>done it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1123
00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:37.570
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1124
00:51:37.690 --> 00:51:38.860
<v Speaker 2>I've never gotten it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't.</v>

1125
00:51:38.890 --> 00:51:40.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I won't take that kind of,</v>

1126
00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:41.173
<v Speaker 2>but before I go on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've fucked up and gotten too high </v>

1127
00:51:43.121 --> 00:51:46.180
<v Speaker 2>before I went onstage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but never so high where I'm like,</v>

1128
00:51:46.181 --> 00:51:48.160
<v Speaker 2>I can't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do that.</v>

1129
00:51:48.161 --> 00:51:49.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm having an anxiety attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1130
00:51:50.180 --> 00:51:53.440
<v Speaker 2>but I've been hired and that hasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to me.</v>

1131
00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:57.490
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it just catches you in time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially if you have a rough set.</v>

1132
00:51:57.850 --> 00:51:58.683
<v Speaker 2>If you had a rough set the night before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're working on some new stuff and </v>

1133
00:52:00.551 --> 00:52:02.260
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't go over right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't recover.</v>

1134
00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:03.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've all been there.</v>

1135
00:52:03.430 --> 00:52:04.263
<v Speaker 2>If you haven't been there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just because you haven't taken </v>

1136
00:52:05.351 --> 00:52:09.940
<v Speaker 2>enough chances.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been there all the time.</v>

1137
00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:14.110
<v Speaker 2>It's like those moments after that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>shaky,</v>

1138
00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.450
<v Speaker 2>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a shaky one or two days,</v>

1139
00:52:16.510 --> 00:52:18.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes sometimes it's not.</v>

1140
00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:19.893
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes it makes sense and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason you could just get right back </v>

1141
00:52:21.581 --> 00:52:22.414
<v Speaker 2>into it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but sometimes there's like a little </v>

1142
00:52:23.381 --> 00:52:24.910
<v Speaker 2>shaky period.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the shaky period,</v>

1143
00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:27.100
<v Speaker 2>that's 70 milligrams was enough to whack</v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

1144
00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:31.990
<v Speaker 2>You did to seventies once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other 70 was from a couple of nights</v>

1145
00:52:32.260 --> 00:52:37.260
<v Speaker 2>just for the general public 70.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll fucking send you down a tornado of</v>

1146
00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:42.310
<v Speaker 2>despair to the bottom Pitsa your soul </v>
<v Speaker 2>just to,</v>

1147
00:52:42.370 --> 00:52:44.470
<v Speaker 2>just to know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't try to do what he's doing.</v>

1148
00:52:44.890 --> 00:52:45.723
<v Speaker 2>Like I won't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't fuck around man with anything </v>

1149
00:52:47.261 --> 00:52:49.250
<v Speaker 2>more than like 30.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that that,</v>

1150
00:52:49.251 --> 00:52:51.250
<v Speaker 2>that even matters what it is though?</v>

1151
00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:52.083
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do think it's that accurate where 70 </v>

1152
00:52:54.041 --> 00:52:59.041
<v Speaker 2>is even ballpark 70 or maybe he just got</v>
<v Speaker 2>something that had 600 in because it was</v>

1153
00:52:59.891 --> 00:53:02.050
<v Speaker 2>like the bottom of the barrel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well you certainly can,</v>

1154
00:53:02.051 --> 00:53:02.884
<v Speaker 2>you know that bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do a bit about the guys who make that </v>

1155
00:53:04.391 --> 00:53:05.200
<v Speaker 2>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1156
00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:08.080
<v Speaker 2>It hasn't gotten any better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Colorado,</v>

1157
00:53:08.081 --> 00:53:10.450
<v Speaker 2>they have it down to a science,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing an in Colorado,</v>

1158
00:53:10.451 --> 00:53:14.710
<v Speaker 2>the way they would make regular cookies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like if you buy like some,</v>

1159
00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:15.623
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Nabisco chips a whole or some shit </v>

1160
00:53:17.441 --> 00:53:19.000
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do them like a factory.</v>

1161
00:53:19.210 --> 00:53:20.043
<v Speaker 2>There's not much difference between the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way they're making some of these </v>

1162
00:53:21.311 --> 00:53:22.144
<v Speaker 2>cookies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have these big machines and they </v>

1163
00:53:24.101 --> 00:53:26.220
<v Speaker 2>have all these people working there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

1164
00:53:26.220 --> 00:53:30.310
<v Speaker 1>pretty fucking down to a science.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not just throw,</v>

1165
00:53:30.410 --> 00:53:33.180
<v Speaker 1>throwing their own ingredients in home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooking,</v>

1166
00:53:33.181 --> 00:53:35.730
<v Speaker 1>all this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're making a lot of money.</v>

1167
00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:39.030
<v Speaker 1>They had this like I'm one of those news</v>
<v Speaker 1>report shows.</v>

1168
00:53:39.090 --> 00:53:41.250
<v Speaker 1>Forget which one was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sixty minutes.</v>

1169
00:53:41.810 --> 00:53:45.030
<v Speaker 1>They went to Denver and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>participated.</v>

1170
00:53:45.031 --> 00:53:45.864
<v Speaker 1>They got high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they got high and fucking Limo with </v>

1171
00:53:46.921 --> 00:53:48.510
<v Speaker 1>these people and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1172
00:53:48.511 --> 00:53:51.630
<v Speaker 1>they went around to all these different </v>
<v Speaker 1>places and watch these people make these</v>

1173
00:53:51.631 --> 00:53:53.210
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that plate.</v>

1174
00:53:53.330 --> 00:53:58.330
<v Speaker 1>There's a revolution going on in Denver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's so off the charts there,</v>

1175
00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:00.773
<v Speaker 1>it's so crazy there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll like you watching this thing on </v>

1176
00:54:03.211 --> 00:54:04.950
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just starts to sink in.</v>

1177
00:54:04.951 --> 00:54:08.700
<v Speaker 1>Like they're changing the whole culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>around that town.</v>

1178
00:54:09.210 --> 00:54:11.790
<v Speaker 1>Like the whole culture is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly chill out.</v>

1179
00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.910
<v Speaker 1>They're violent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crime rate is so low now.</v>

1180
00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:15.953
<v Speaker 1>They're fucking drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Driving rates are the lowest they've </v>

1181
00:54:17.791 --> 00:54:18.624
<v Speaker 1>ever had.</v>

1182
00:54:18.830 --> 00:54:21.150
<v Speaker 1>It's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's changing everything.</v>

1183
00:54:21.151 --> 00:54:21.984
<v Speaker 1>And it's only been a year to like how </v>
<v Speaker 1>many years has it been since it's been </v>

1184
00:54:25.111 --> 00:54:26.350
<v Speaker 1>legal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the official?</v>

1185
00:54:26.351 --> 00:54:28.530
<v Speaker 1>It'll be two years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it going to Jamie?</v>

1186
00:54:28.820 --> 00:54:30.340
<v Speaker 1>If I find out when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the,</v>

1187
00:54:30.341 --> 00:54:31.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the law went through,</v>

1188
00:54:32.100 --> 00:54:33.990
<v Speaker 1>but in Oregon they're going to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>lead.</v>

1189
00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:35.223
<v Speaker 1>We tax free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oregon's taking it to a totally new </v>

1190
00:54:37.831 --> 00:54:39.960
<v Speaker 1>level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Washington just a,</v>

1191
00:54:39.961 --> 00:54:40.794
<v Speaker 1>I just saw a red or a part that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington it had like I think </v>

1192
00:54:42.361 --> 00:54:46.020
<v Speaker 1>$70,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>their first year of tax revenue.</v>

1193
00:54:46.170 --> 00:54:48.330
<v Speaker 1>So that seems like a lot of money just </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1194
00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:50.970
<v Speaker 1>that's a lot throw away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I agree with you.</v>

1195
00:54:51.060 --> 00:54:53.540
<v Speaker 1>I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the taxes that the,</v>

1196
00:54:53.541 --> 00:54:54.374
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Colorado and poses which are really </v>

1197
00:54:55.591 --> 00:54:57.570
<v Speaker 1>high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think those are great.</v>

1198
00:54:57.620 --> 00:54:58.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

1199
00:54:58.050 --> 00:55:01.230
<v Speaker 1>Because it's still better than going </v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking if you go drinking.</v>

1200
00:55:01.231 --> 00:55:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we have a few drinks,</v>

1201
00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:03.863
<v Speaker 1>like if I go and get us around and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>four of us went out drinking and I look </v>

1202
00:55:06.911 --> 00:55:11.070
<v Speaker 1>at this kids shots and a beer and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 100 bucks right all together.</v>

1203
00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:15.240
<v Speaker 1>Then you got to tip the guy that like </v>
<v Speaker 1>200 bucks for the weed.</v>

1204
00:55:15.450 --> 00:55:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we the four of us with 200 bucks,</v>

1205
00:55:18.721 --> 00:55:19.554
<v Speaker 1>whether we'd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd be fucked for a month and we could </v>

1206
00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:22.380
<v Speaker 1>take home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

1207
00:55:22.381 --> 00:55:24.750
<v Speaker 1>$200.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot of weed.</v>

1208
00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:27.780
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you're buying edibles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1209
00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:32.400
<v Speaker 1>You could almost die on $200 worth of </v>
<v Speaker 1>weed edibles.</v>

1210
00:55:32.401 --> 00:55:34.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you ate them all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's happening last year?</v>

1211
00:55:34.830 --> 00:55:35.663
<v Speaker 1>Beginning of last year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they 2012 voted at the end of 2012 </v>

1212
00:55:39.481 --> 00:55:42.160
<v Speaker 1>and started at the beginning of 2014.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1213
00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:43.550
<v Speaker 1>oh I see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

1214
00:55:43.590 --> 00:55:45.660
<v Speaker 1>So there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a delay.</v>

1215
00:55:45.690 --> 00:55:46.523
<v Speaker 1>That is one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I gotta be honest with you that as one </v>

1216
00:55:47.971 --> 00:55:51.520
<v Speaker 1>of the funnest four days you'll have as </v>

1217
00:55:52.510 --> 00:55:53.343
<v Speaker 1>oh Denver is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you stayed down because </v>

1218
00:55:55.201 --> 00:55:58.350
<v Speaker 1>you eat at Sam's that motherfucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>Green Chili for breakfast with those two</v>

1219
00:55:58.351 --> 00:56:00.390
<v Speaker 1>weeks or some wheat toast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A bowl of fruit.</v>

1220
00:56:00.510 --> 00:56:04.020
<v Speaker 1>God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

1221
00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:05.450
<v Speaker 1>What're you going to talk about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The crowds?</v>

1222
00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.900
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got the weed store.</v>

1223
00:56:08.930 --> 00:56:10.770
<v Speaker 1>Then you've got the comedy world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like a three.</v>

1224
00:56:10.771 --> 00:56:12.300
<v Speaker 1>It's like you can't lose for three days </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

1225
00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:13.153
<v Speaker 1>The gym you cannot lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a triple fuckin head of the with </v>

1226
00:56:15.661 --> 00:56:16.920
<v Speaker 1>little weed store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got the.</v>

1227
00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:20.970
<v Speaker 1>They go out on the recreational side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have some strong stuff.</v>

1228
00:56:20.971 --> 00:56:24.040
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a great</v>

1229
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:25.330
<v Speaker 5>spot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a great little weeds.</v>

1230
00:56:25.331 --> 00:56:26.164
<v Speaker 5>One of my favorite places.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the few places I would live </v>

1231
00:56:27.850 --> 00:56:29.260
<v Speaker 5>besides here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you what,</v>

1232
00:56:29.290 --> 00:56:31.480
<v Speaker 5>you made me laugh because I thought </v>
<v Speaker 5>about something,</v>

1233
00:56:31.481 --> 00:56:31.900
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Band,</v>

1234
00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:34.510
<v Speaker 5>you know what pill when I was growing </v>
<v Speaker 5>up,</v>

1235
00:56:34.511 --> 00:56:37.330
<v Speaker 5>had a lot of mistakes with them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What pill?</v>

1236
00:56:37.331 --> 00:56:41.620
<v Speaker 5>Like if they made 100 of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>10 of them would always be quite loose.</v>

1237
00:56:41.890 --> 00:56:42.810
<v Speaker 5>Really kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

1238
00:56:42.811 --> 00:56:45.790
<v Speaker 5>we're always done what they done because</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was corruption.</v>

1239
00:56:45.820 --> 00:56:46.653
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it would dodge because the guy who was </v>

1240
00:56:48.611 --> 00:56:51.070
<v Speaker 5>making him his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his flaw was lopsided.</v>

1241
00:56:51.630 --> 00:56:53.520
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You put them in the oven.</v>

1242
00:56:53.570 --> 00:56:56.410
<v Speaker 5>Who the fuck knows Joe Rogan?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't fucking know.</v>

1243
00:56:56.860 --> 00:57:01.860
<v Speaker 5>He was lopsided right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This table chemicals go down to the bike</v>

1244
00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:09.900
<v Speaker 5>for every hundred.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The most ridiculous idea.</v>

1245
00:57:11.410 --> 00:57:12.243
<v Speaker 5>Pills ever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's just say the power goes to this </v>

1246
00:57:16.891 --> 00:57:17.724
<v Speaker 5>side,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you need 10 biscuits and nothing </v>

1247
00:57:19.631 --> 00:57:21.400
<v Speaker 5>would happen and people would go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my God,</v>

1248
00:57:21.401 --> 00:57:23.920
<v Speaker 5>I got a dud.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That means the next one's gonna be good.</v>

1249
00:57:24.490 --> 00:57:28.090
<v Speaker 5>That was a philosophy around the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But that's a different philosophy to it.</v>

1250
00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:31.060
<v Speaker 5>What if cosby gave one of those guides </v>
<v Speaker 5>to one of his freaks?</v>

1251
00:57:31.090 --> 00:57:31.923
<v Speaker 5>Just see.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1252
00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:33.453
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and it was a big black dick waiting on </v>

1253
00:57:37.001 --> 00:57:41.770
<v Speaker 5>them pills to heather and shit and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a great bit.</v>

1254
00:57:41.771 --> 00:57:42.850
<v Speaker 5>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do you</v>

1255
00:57:42.850 --> 00:57:46.880
<v Speaker 1>think that he could get laid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could have probably almost any of the</v>

1256
00:57:46.881 --> 00:57:49.280
<v Speaker 1>girls he wanted to drug anyways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably.</v>

1257
00:57:49.281 --> 00:57:52.140
<v Speaker 1>Why do you think he did that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's positive.</v>

1258
00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:55.670
<v Speaker 1>It's part of is free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean we could speculate all day long,</v>

1259
00:57:55.790 --> 00:57:58.420
<v Speaker 1>but obviously he's sick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1260
00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:01.700
<v Speaker 1>Obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we kind of knew that anyway,</v>

1261
00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:05.030
<v Speaker 1>it's not the new sick to the extent that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is,</v>

1262
00:58:05.330 --> 00:58:09.340
<v Speaker 1>but he's got this like creepy arrogance </v>
<v Speaker 1>about him and uh,</v>

1263
00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:11.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we played that clip once,</v>

1264
00:58:12.410 --> 00:58:16.760
<v Speaker 1>or Wanda Sykes who was like the sweetest</v>
<v Speaker 1>person in the world was interviewing him</v>

1265
00:58:17.030 --> 00:58:19.940
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the way she was talking to him,</v>

1266
00:58:20.210 --> 00:58:23.240
<v Speaker 1>I guess he didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he corrected her.</v>

1267
00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:25.600
<v Speaker 1>He corrected her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know her,</v>

1268
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:29.000
<v Speaker 1>her use of ebonics or what have you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rod Mcqueen,</v>

1269
00:58:29.001 --> 00:58:32.000
<v Speaker 1>kind of just not a nice guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just not a nice guy.</v>

1270
00:58:32.001 --> 00:58:33.230
<v Speaker 1>And he was wearing sunglasses.</v>

1271
00:58:33.230 --> 00:58:34.280
<v Speaker 1>Like he's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1272
00:58:34.550 --> 00:58:36.260
<v Speaker 1>when you're indoors you're wearing </v>
<v Speaker 1>sunglasses,</v>

1273
00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:38.780
<v Speaker 1>like unless you've got glaucoma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck you doing?</v>

1274
00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:41.240
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do you have sunglasses on?</v>

1275
00:58:41.870 --> 00:58:45.870
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get away with floyd mayweather,</v>

1276
00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:48.620
<v Speaker 1>you with sunglasses or whatever the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wants as far as I'm concerned.</v>

1277
00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:50.870
<v Speaker 1>He can wear sunglasses anywhere he </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants,</v>

1278
00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:54.020
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like those.</v>

1279
00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:55.550
<v Speaker 1>Anyone who does that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1280
00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:56.473
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just weird because I could see </v>

1281
00:58:57.381 --> 00:59:00.200
<v Speaker 1>where it looked like a normal person </v>
<v Speaker 1>would drug it to cut,</v>

1282
00:59:00.201 --> 00:59:01.940
<v Speaker 1>just to get laid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just seems like,</v>

1283
00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:05.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he built fucking cosby creep.</v>

1284
00:59:06.170 --> 00:59:09.080
<v Speaker 1>Did he like the girl just being passed </v>
<v Speaker 1>out like it's dry.</v>

1285
00:59:09.081 --> 00:59:10.820
<v Speaker 1>He likes dry sex or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might.</v>

1286
00:59:10.850 --> 00:59:11.683
<v Speaker 1>He might like to be the God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might like to be totally in control </v>

1287
00:59:15.021 --> 00:59:15.560
<v Speaker 1>of their life.</v>

1288
00:59:15.560 --> 00:59:16.393
<v Speaker 1>It might like the idea that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he tricked them and they now they </v>

1289
00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:23.240
<v Speaker 1>to do his bidding while they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely unconscious.</v>

1290
00:59:23.241 --> 00:59:24.074
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how unconscious they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're in like a halfway dream </v>

1291
00:59:26.161 --> 00:59:28.130
<v Speaker 1>land where he could talk to them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing stuff,</v>

1292
00:59:28.340 --> 00:59:29.173
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like lift your legs up and they'll just </v>

1293
00:59:30.021 --> 00:59:32.240
<v Speaker 1>do it and they just don't remember it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might just be so fucked.</v>

1294
00:59:32.250 --> 00:59:34.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand.</v>

<v Speaker 1>We're at 80 percent.</v>

1303
00:59:54.470 --> 00:59:58.550

<v Speaker 1>eight out of 10 times,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know what happens entirely on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>individual.</v>

1311
01:00:17.770 --> 01:00:19.770
<v Speaker 1>The intent when you're a guy like bill </v>
<v Speaker 1>cosby,</v>

1312
01:00:19.771 --> 01:00:21.190

<v Speaker 1>multi,</v>

1313
01:00:21.191 --> 01:00:22.024
<v Speaker 1>multimillion dollar women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've got to go to his room without </v>

1314
01:00:23.481 --> 01:00:24.890
<v Speaker 1>sucking his dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's be honest.</v>

1315
01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:28.750
<v Speaker 1>Not a whole lot of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of them.</v>

1316
01:00:28.790 --> 01:00:29.623
<v Speaker 1>I've got to go into that room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether that married or that half of </v>

1317
01:00:32.001 --> 01:00:34.070
<v Speaker 1>those bitches got a different story </v>
<v Speaker 1>also.</v>

01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:35.253
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He drugged you because you were alone </v>

1319
01:00:36.801 --> 01:00:38.990
<v Speaker 1>with him in a fucking room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had plans.</v>

1320
01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:43.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm not blaming them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when joe were men here were met.</v>

1321
01:00:43.490 --> 01:00:46.580
<v Speaker 1>You know when you go into a hotel room </v>
<v Speaker 1>or his trailer,</v>

1322
01:00:47.210 --> 01:00:52.010
<v Speaker 1>you know what the fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he had to put a pill into your thing.</v>

1323
01:00:52.011 --> 01:00:55.670
<v Speaker 1>He's a dirty mother Fucker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get that out of the way because he</v>

1324
01:00:55.671 --> 01:00:56.504
<v Speaker 1>enjoys that faint woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that woman that's half dead and that's </v>

1325
01:01:00.441 --> 01:01:02.270
<v Speaker 1>what he his.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's his freak.</v>

1326
01:01:02.450 --> 01:01:03.283
<v Speaker 1>Some people still bodies from cemetery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people want to get jerked off with </v>

1327
01:01:06.591 --> 01:01:08.060
<v Speaker 1>their feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was his.</v>

1328
01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:09.673
<v Speaker 1>I had a friend who was after a while I </v>
<v Speaker 1>was doing and he said they were jerking </v>

1329
01:01:12.651 --> 01:01:14.230
<v Speaker 1>off his feet because he was scared of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hip,</v>

1330
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:16.520
<v Speaker 1>so he just happened to jerk him off of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his feet.</v>

1331
01:01:16.850 --> 01:01:18.350
<v Speaker 1>Their feet with their feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1332
01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:20.480
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't do that either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just as worse.</v>

1333
01:01:21.290 --> 01:01:22.123
<v Speaker 1>Hooker feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we'll hook a dirty concrete and </v>

1334
01:01:23.871 --> 01:01:25.430
<v Speaker 1>sperm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That shit don't mix,</v>

1335
01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:26.900
<v Speaker 1>but let's face it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1336
01:01:27.110 --> 01:01:31.010
<v Speaker 1>he took those women to his room and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>has a real interesting take on this.</v>

1337
01:01:31.350 --> 01:01:33.860
<v Speaker 1>He had a real good taking this and there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was another guy that got charged for.</v>

1338
01:01:33.861 --> 01:01:36.860
<v Speaker 1>It was like cee Lo Green guy was giving </v>
<v Speaker 1>girls ecstasy or something like that.</v>

1339
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:37.783
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grandma's getting molly and Eddie was </v>

1340
01:01:39.711 --> 01:01:40.544
<v Speaker 1>talking about like what it must be like </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be like a really famous guy who's </v>

1341
01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:44.353
<v Speaker 1>really rich but you're also like maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>not the most attractive guy in the </v>

1342
01:01:47.661 --> 01:01:48.590
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1343
01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:50.810
<v Speaker 1>so like maybe some of them they want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get to know you,</v>

1344
01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:53.990
<v Speaker 1>but then when you want them to like be </v>
<v Speaker 1>sexually attracted to you,</v>

1345
01:01:54.290 --> 01:01:55.123
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so if you're a creep you start </v>

1346
01:01:58.371 --> 01:02:01.520
<v Speaker 1>drugging them and that's what Eddie was </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposing.</v>

1347
01:02:01.550 --> 01:02:02.383
<v Speaker 1>Who's saying like maybe like he just got</v>
<v Speaker 1>tired of them saying no and he thought </v>

1348
01:02:05.691 --> 01:02:07.700
<v Speaker 1>he was better than them and just dropped</v>
<v Speaker 1>it in.</v>

1349
01:02:07.701 --> 01:02:11.540
<v Speaker 1>I forget exactly the words but I hadn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered it like that.</v>

1350
01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:12.373
<v Speaker 1>I hadn't thought about it like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe maybe they're not all saying </v>

1351
01:02:15.261 --> 01:02:16.094
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe it is a weird thing with </v>

1352
01:02:17.781 --> 01:02:18.614
<v Speaker 1>them where it got really frustrating and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then he just decided to do it or is it </v>

1353
01:02:23.041 --> 01:02:25.410
<v Speaker 1>possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That may be.</v>

1354
01:02:25.411 --> 01:02:26.244
<v Speaker 1>This was like a much more prevalent and </v>
<v Speaker 1>accepted thing in the circles that he </v>

1355
01:02:30.721 --> 01:02:31.554
<v Speaker 1>was running in the 19 sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible that people like you </v>

1356
01:02:34.811 --> 01:02:35.644
<v Speaker 1>would talk about people giving people a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mickey or he did a joke about Spanish </v>

1357
01:02:39.331 --> 01:02:40.164
<v Speaker 1>fly that Spanish fly Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it possible that more people were </v>

1358
01:02:43.111 --> 01:02:45.390
<v Speaker 1>doing this back then and we're just </v>
<v Speaker 1>finding out about it now?</v>

1359
01:02:46.970 --> 01:02:50.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know because I mean they </v>
<v Speaker 1>slipping the Mickey thing was totally.</v>

1360
01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:51.173
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Spanish fly thing was almost </v>

1361
01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:57.030
<v Speaker 1>common like people talked about like on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tonight show.</v>

1362
01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:59.770
<v Speaker 1>I think bill cosby talked about it like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1363
01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:04.280
<v Speaker 1>and it seemed like it was more accepted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was,</v>

1364
01:03:04.281 --> 01:03:09.000
<v Speaker 1>it they weren't aware was it like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know anybody who got like in</v>

1365
01:03:09.001 --> 01:03:11.820
<v Speaker 1>the sixties or seventies who got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mickey slipped into them.</v>

1366
01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why was that such a common expression?</v>

1367
01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Charles Bronson never did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>James Colbert never did it.</v>

1368

<v Speaker 1>It's really dark.</v>

1374
01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:34.313
<v Speaker 1>There's something really dark about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you can imagine like what is just </v>

1375
01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:38.700
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's,</v>

1376
01:03:38.730 --> 01:03:40.740
<v Speaker 1>what's going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is his essence?</v>

1377
01:03:40.830 --> 01:03:42.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1378
01:03:42.790 --> 01:03:47.400
<v Speaker 1>He's doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was there a movie that made it look sexy</v>

1379
01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:49.020
<v Speaker 1>back in that day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a James Bond,</v>

1380
01:03:49.021 --> 01:03:49.410
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1381
01:03:49.410 --> 01:03:53.260
<v Speaker 1>I got some Spanish fly that seems like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember there was,</v>

1382
01:03:53.550 --> 01:03:55.080
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a movie though,</v>

1383
01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:55.973
<v Speaker 1>animal house where he had to decide </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether or not to do the right thing or </v>

1384
01:03:59.431 --> 01:04:00.300
<v Speaker 1>the wrong thing.</v>

1385
01:04:00.490 --> 01:04:05.490
<v Speaker 1>Remember the black on the show has the </v>
<v Speaker 1>angel was saying,</v>

1386
01:04:05.491 --> 01:04:05.940
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1387
01:04:05.940 --> 01:04:07.630
<v Speaker 1>she's blacked out devils.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like fuck her,</v>

1388
01:04:07.631 --> 01:04:09.860
<v Speaker 1>suck her tits fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

1389
01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:11.670
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't figure out what to do.</v>

1390
01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:13.710
<v Speaker 1>Like you could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably couldn't even do that movie</v>

1391
01:04:13.711 --> 01:04:18.480
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as a joke,</v>

1392
01:04:18.570 --> 01:04:20.340
<v Speaker 1>you can't mean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one thing if this was.</v>

1393
01:04:20.510 --> 01:04:24.570
<v Speaker 1>You can obviously have a horrific rape </v>
<v Speaker 1>scene if it's like a drama,</v>

1394
01:04:24.650 --> 01:04:25.483
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if it's a comedy and you're joking </v>

1395
01:04:27.751 --> 01:04:29.580
<v Speaker 1>around about right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't have that.</v>

1396
01:04:30.030 --> 01:04:30.863
<v Speaker 1>No one will accept that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last rape scene that made you </v>

1397
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:33.703
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable for use with movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just always rape scenes that make you </v>

1398
01:04:37.501 --> 01:04:39.630
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm saying is that you couldn't</v>

1399
01:04:39.631 --> 01:04:42.400
<v Speaker 1>have a joke about potentially raping </v>
<v Speaker 1>girl,</v>

1400
01:04:42.401 --> 01:04:44.370
<v Speaker 1>like Animal House,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you could have.</v>

1401
01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:47.610
<v Speaker 1>You could have a horrible scene in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>realistic show,</v>

1402
01:04:47.790 --> 01:04:50.610
<v Speaker 1>but we're the devils on your shoulder </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a gone fuck her.</v>

1403
01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:51.630
<v Speaker 1>Fuck her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like that's A.</v>

1405
01:04:54.030 --> 01:04:56.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you could do that today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll watch this for a second.</v>

1406

1409
01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:06.900

<v Speaker 1>this in the fucking movie at the time.</v>

1483
01:10:07.431 --> 01:10:09.110
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did you throw up car on the ocean?</v>

1484
01:10:10.210 --> 01:10:11.043
<v Speaker 1>Because it needed a carwash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamie put on the chase scene from </v>

1485
01:10:15.951 --> 01:10:18.110
<v Speaker 1>bullet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched bullet this year.</v>

1486
01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:22.850
<v Speaker 1>I was up in Canada and it was on tv,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you got to sit there and go,</v>

1487
01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:24.213
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck were they thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched it from the beginning to the </v>

1488
01:10:26.001 --> 01:10:26.834
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was full of Steve McQueen cop movie </v>

1489
01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:31.053
<v Speaker 1>in San Francisco and they have a crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>scene with the 68 Mustang where McQueen </v>

1490
01:10:34.551 --> 01:10:35.384
<v Speaker 1>is chasing this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy's chasing him and a dodge </v>

1491
01:10:36.651 --> 01:10:37.790
<v Speaker 1>charger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1492
01:10:37.791 --> 01:10:39.380
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great car scenes.</v>

1493
01:10:39.381 --> 01:10:40.214
<v Speaker 1>Look at this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy's got this gigantic dodge </v>

1494
01:10:41.961 --> 01:10:45.530
<v Speaker 1>charger and he's got this dope 68 </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mustang,</v>

1495
01:10:45.531 --> 01:10:49.220
<v Speaker 1>which for cars back then handled a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really God damn good.</v>

1496
01:10:49.250 --> 01:10:52.550
<v Speaker 1>I mean that was a lightweight car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a good amount of power,</v>

1497
01:10:52.880 --> 01:10:57.800
<v Speaker 1>but you know the drum brakes and shitty </v>
<v Speaker 1>suspension and so these guys are driving</v>

1498
01:10:57.801 --> 01:10:59.680
<v Speaker 1>around the corners in these bars.</v>

1499
01:11:05.290 --> 01:11:09.290
<v Speaker 7>Let's pull it back.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This was when you were a stock man.</v>

1500
01:11:09.720 --> 01:11:11.780
<v Speaker 7>This guy's in the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Fuck fate is.</v>

1501
01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:14.070
<v Speaker 7>That guy actually got thousand stitches </v>
<v Speaker 7>and</v>

1502
01:11:14.070 --> 01:11:14.903
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when you fucking were a stunt </v>

1503
01:11:16.670 --> 01:11:18.060
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have pads or nothing.</v>

1504
01:11:18.061 --> 01:11:21.240
<v Speaker 1>You did it with wranglers on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much a Steve McQueen zone driving.</v>

1505
01:11:21.241 --> 01:11:22.074
<v Speaker 1>Did he do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much in the movie </v>

1506
01:11:24.331 --> 01:11:26.790
<v Speaker 1>because he's obviously doing some of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could drive his asshole.</v>

1507
01:11:26.850 --> 01:11:27.890
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could drive his ass.</v>

1508
01:11:28.010 --> 01:11:30.060
<v Speaker 1>He used to write the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He played with this.</v>

1509
01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:31.690
<v Speaker 1>What was the name of them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let the mom.</v>

1510
01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:36.060
<v Speaker 1>He plays a great movie that I forgot all</v>
<v Speaker 1>about that movie.</v>

1511
01:11:37.170 --> 01:11:40.590
<v Speaker 1>A lump and it's another movie that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>for like 10 minutes.</v>

1512
01:11:40.591 --> 01:11:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Nobody says a word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the thing about this chasing.</v>

1513
01:11:44.790 --> 01:11:47.730
<v Speaker 1>One of the craziest things about it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>how well orchestrated it is.</v>

1514
01:11:47.731 --> 01:11:48.564
<v Speaker 1>How cool it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that skinny ass bitch just would </v>

1515
01:11:50.851 --> 01:11:52.830
<v Speaker 1>not work for other people to walk out of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this movie.</v>

1516
01:11:53.540 --> 01:11:54.211
<v Speaker 1>Are they?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would they have?</v>

1517
01:11:54.211 --> 01:11:55.660
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not me,</v>

1518
01:11:55.710 --> 01:11:59.370
<v Speaker 1>but today the attention span for a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>time movie for sure.</v>

1519
01:11:59.610 --> 01:12:03.450
<v Speaker 1>People are used to these smash cuts and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they used to MTV style editing,</v>

1520
01:12:03.810 --> 01:12:05.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like music videos,</v>

<v Speaker 1>at Eddie Bravo again.</v>

1522
01:12:09.661 --> 01:12:11.850
<v Speaker 1>Explain that to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was talking to me about how they make</v>

1523
01:12:11.851 --> 01:12:14.070
<v Speaker 1>music videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever noticed they're constantly</v>

1524
01:12:14.071 --> 01:12:17.160
<v Speaker 1>switching angles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Constantly changing the way it looks.</v>

1525
01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:18.173
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a static image for like </v>

1526
01:12:19.621 --> 01:12:21.180
<v Speaker 1>60 seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1527
01:12:21.181 --> 01:12:22.440
<v Speaker 1>like someone's standing there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

1528
01:12:22.441 --> 01:12:23.910
<v Speaker 1>that's really rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the time,</v>

1529
01:12:24.270 --> 01:12:25.103
<v Speaker 1>especially pop songs are constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to move the image around to keep </v>

1530
01:12:27.781 --> 01:12:31.200
<v Speaker 1>you interested in it.</v>

1534
01:12:39.151 --> 01:12:41.010
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the beginning of the mechanic,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Remember those fieros Pontiac fieros my </v>

1559
01:13:45.541 --> 01:13:49.950
<v Speaker 1>sister had.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was the trade in value on those was when</v>

1560
01:13:49.951 --> 01:13:53.160
<v Speaker 1>you brought those back there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like 800 people would crack right there.</v>

1561
01:13:53.161 --> 01:13:56.180
<v Speaker 1>Like a statue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I paid 8,000.</v>

1562
01:13:56.190 --> 01:13:58.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot about that scene.</v>

1563
01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:02.400
<v Speaker 1>The guy loses the car and goes right </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the gas station and it blows up.</v>

1564
01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:05.410
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he almost lost cars and muscle cars.</v>

1565
01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:06.833
<v Speaker 1>They still have them today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was looking in the back of a one of </v>

1566
01:14:09.211 --> 01:14:10.044
<v Speaker 1>those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hot rod magazines and they had this </v>

1567
01:14:11.801 --> 01:14:12.634
<v Speaker 1>kit car thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like not that much money either </v>

1568
01:14:14.711 --> 01:14:18.040
<v Speaker 1>for the kit and you put it together </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself and you have to.</v>

1569
01:14:18.041 --> 01:14:19.450
<v Speaker 1>I think you have to put an engine in it.</v>

1570
01:14:19.450 --> 01:14:21.850
<v Speaker 1>You have to do the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some people actually do that.</v>

1571
01:14:21.851 --> 01:14:26.800
<v Speaker 1>They actually build their own cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For my first car when I was 15,</v>

1572
01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:27.693
<v Speaker 1>that was one of my options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was to get a army kit car where you </v>

1573
01:14:30.670 --> 01:14:34.450
<v Speaker 1>build your own arm to get the juice with</v>
<v Speaker 1>two other 50 bucks.</v>

1574
01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:36.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pulling out a different frame,</v>

1575
01:14:36.371 --> 01:14:37.360
<v Speaker 1>but something crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1576
01:14:37.361 --> 01:14:42.361
<v Speaker 1>It was advertised in comic books.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a car thing.</v>

1577
01:14:42.611 --> 01:14:44.350
<v Speaker 1>It's called the noble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's called,</v>

1578
01:14:44.590 --> 01:14:45.423
<v Speaker 1>but it's a car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's from England and they ship </v>

1579
01:14:47.141 --> 01:14:48.640
<v Speaker 1>it over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's this beautiful,</v>

1580
01:14:48.641 --> 01:14:49.474
<v Speaker 1>crazy looking sports car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They ship it over here with no engine </v>

1581
01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:54.270
<v Speaker 1>and you have to get an engine put in it </v>
<v Speaker 1>so I can.</v>

1582
01:14:54.271 --> 01:14:55.690
<v Speaker 1>So it's not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's,</v>

1583
01:14:55.930 --> 01:14:58.960
<v Speaker 1>they don't consider it a car when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>buy it and that's how they could sell it</v>

1584
01:14:58.961 --> 01:15:01.130
<v Speaker 1>to you because it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1585
01:15:01.390 --> 01:15:02.223
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have all the.</v>

1586
01:15:02.590 --> 01:15:06.520
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't pass all the regulations that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you knew how to do that.</v>

1587
01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:09.040
<v Speaker 1>Is Maserati the Italian car?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

1588
01:15:09.070 --> 01:15:11.800
<v Speaker 1>They had it when they were shipping cars</v>
<v Speaker 1>over in the seventies.</v>

1589
01:15:12.250 --> 01:15:13.950
<v Speaker 1>They had to take the edge inside and </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

1590
01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:16.450
<v Speaker 1>So the mafia couldn't steal the cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

1591
01:15:16.480 --> 01:15:17.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also,</v>

1592
01:15:17.321 --> 01:15:18.154
<v Speaker 1>when they sent the Italian shoes over </v>
<v Speaker 1>after a while they would just send cog </v>

1593
01:15:21.071 --> 01:15:21.904
<v Speaker 1>was right shoes and then goes with left </v>
<v Speaker 1>shoes because life that they wouldn't </v>

1594
01:15:24.791 --> 01:15:26.410
<v Speaker 1>get robbed.</v>

<v Speaker 1>long shoreman like that.</v>

1602
01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:46.713

<v Speaker 1>depicted in movies as being organized </v>

01:15:51.071 --> 01:15:51.910

<v Speaker 1>I have a friend till this day I talked </v>

01:16:06.971 --> 01:16:10.280
<v Speaker 1>to him yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still drives cars off the ships.</v>

1610
01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:11.230
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those were 11.</v>

1611
01:16:11.410 --> 01:16:12.243
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the ships come in with like Honda's </v>

1612
01:16:13.511 --> 01:16:18.420
<v Speaker 1>and shit out 40 fucking dollars an hour </v>
<v Speaker 1>plus overtime drugs since he was in high</v>

1613
01:16:18.421 --> 01:16:19.420
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1614
01:16:19.421 --> 01:16:20.710
<v Speaker 1>this is what I was going to ask you </v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier,</v>

1615
01:16:20.711 --> 01:16:22.330
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't want to interrupt your </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

1616
01:16:23.530 --> 01:16:26.650
<v Speaker 1>The reason why did they grow heroin in </v>
<v Speaker 1>other countries.</v>

1617
01:16:26.651 --> 01:16:27.970
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know if you know the answer</v>
<v Speaker 1>to this,</v>

1618
01:16:28.090 --> 01:16:28.923
<v Speaker 1>but they grow it in other countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they can't grow it here or did </v>

1619
01:16:31.451 --> 01:16:34.590
<v Speaker 1>they grow it in other countries because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not financially viable?</v>

1620
01:16:34.810 --> 01:16:35.800
<v Speaker 1>The poppy seed.</v>

1621
01:16:35.930 --> 01:16:36.763
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

1622
01:16:36.910 --> 01:16:38.680
<v Speaker 1>let me tell you something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I need a drug dealer,</v>

1623
01:16:38.681 --> 01:16:42.160
<v Speaker 1>could grow poppy seeds here and </v>
<v Speaker 1>eliminate the travel,</v>

1624
01:16:42.430 --> 01:16:44.980
<v Speaker 1>they would have done it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but would they have what I'm saying?</v>

1625
01:16:44.981 --> 01:16:48.070
<v Speaker 1>What I'm thinking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could cut that cost out.</v>

1626
01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:50.410
<v Speaker 1>Eliminate that whole fucking journey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

1627
01:16:50.750 --> 01:16:51.583
<v Speaker 1>I think you need a lot of land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's one of those things that </v>

1628
01:16:53.941 --> 01:16:56.920
<v Speaker 1>would be really hard to do indoors </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I think it's something that they</v>

1629
01:16:56.921 --> 01:17:01.150
<v Speaker 1>do like when they make heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need a lot of land to make a smaller</v>

1630
01:17:01.151 --> 01:17:03.220
<v Speaker 1>amount of heroin than you would think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seed.</v>

1631
01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:04.073
<v Speaker 1>This comes from heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from the poppy plant and I think </v>

1632
01:17:07.470 --> 01:17:09.040
<v Speaker 1>it's high out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like coca leaves,</v>

1633
01:17:09.170 --> 01:17:10.400
<v Speaker 1>don't they grow cocoa?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lucy,</v>

1634
01:17:10.401 --> 01:17:12.170
<v Speaker 1>are you fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly the same question,</v>

1635
01:17:13.250 --> 01:17:16.850
<v Speaker 1>but I heard now that that's a big a </v>
<v Speaker 1>market now.</v>

1636
01:17:16.851 --> 01:17:17.684
<v Speaker 1>People important coca leaves people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Beverly Hills now having coachella </v>

1637
01:17:20.360 --> 01:17:21.193
<v Speaker 1>parties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which cigar will you choose and you </v>

1638
01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:28.280
<v Speaker 1>smoke a cigar and drink one and people </v>
<v Speaker 1>get fucked up.</v>

1639
01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:31.250
<v Speaker 1>That's the room at like $300 of leaf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the deal is.</v>

1640
01:17:31.251 --> 01:17:33.380
<v Speaker 1>I've never eaten no fucking leaves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would.</v>

1641
01:17:33.530 --> 01:17:36.530
<v Speaker 1>The people in the high altitude out </v>
<v Speaker 1>Peru,</v>

1642
01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:38.960
<v Speaker 1>they have bags of these things they take</v>
<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>

1643
01:17:38.961 --> 01:17:39.794
<v Speaker 1>It's really kind of freaky to watch and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they packed their mouths with it and </v>

1644
01:17:41.991 --> 01:17:42.824
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have like a squirrel size lump on </v>

1645
01:17:44.121 --> 01:17:47.180
<v Speaker 1>the side of their face and they just </v>
<v Speaker 1>chew these fucking chewing tobacco.</v>

1646
01:17:47.230 --> 01:17:50.000
<v Speaker 1>Only cocoa leaves except it's actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of healthy for you.</v>

1647
01:17:50.240 --> 01:17:52.340
<v Speaker 1>It's not bad for x before you read the </v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

1648
01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:53.673
<v Speaker 1>what was I?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a fucking new drug that you see </v>

1649
01:17:56.121 --> 01:17:57.380
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This crocodile?</v>

1650
01:17:57.530 --> 01:17:59.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been awhile around for awhile.</v>

1651
01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:03.500
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where they take the lottery.</v>

1652
01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:06.630
<v Speaker 1>They processed it to something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put two drugs in this.</v>

1653
01:18:06.890 --> 01:18:10.430
<v Speaker 1>That's a Lane and Red Sofa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That should tell you right there.</v>

1654
01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:12.680
<v Speaker 1>That's not the drug for me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right or wrong.</v>

1655
01:18:12.681 --> 01:18:15.620
<v Speaker 1>When you put gasoline and then it eats </v>
<v Speaker 1>to skin.</v>

1656
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:20.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's causing some of this get you.</v>

1657
01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:22.363
<v Speaker 1>I think it starts out when they just </v>
<v Speaker 1>have like a little bit of like a bruise </v>

1658
01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:26.633
<v Speaker 1>area are fucked up area and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just get hooked on shooting it in </v>

1659
01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:31.273
<v Speaker 1>and they keep shooting in that spot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It keeps getting worse and worse and </v>

1660
01:18:32.970 --> 01:18:35.800
<v Speaker 1>it's just not getting better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it starts really going down the</v>

1661
01:18:35.801 --> 01:18:38.420
<v Speaker 1>hill and then they get super depressed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they keep shooting in there.</v>

1662
01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:40.940
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a real bad drug,</v>

1663
01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:42.650
<v Speaker 1>real dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>scary drug.</v>

1664
01:18:42.651 --> 01:18:44.630
<v Speaker 1>And apparently they're doing it when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't get heroin,</v>

1665
01:18:45.030 --> 01:18:45.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

1666
01:18:45.670 --> 01:18:48.380
<v Speaker 1>that's how a lot of it got started where</v>
<v Speaker 1>I read online.</v>

1667
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:50.000
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the images of their.</v>

1668
01:18:50.001 --> 01:18:50.834
<v Speaker 1>Correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It fills a real images of people's </v>

1669
01:18:51.921 --> 01:18:52.400
<v Speaker 1>bones.</v>

1670
01:18:52.400 --> 01:18:53.640
<v Speaker 1>Poked out of their schedule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1671
01:18:53.930 --> 01:18:56.630
<v Speaker 1>That really is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a spooky as fuck.</v>

1672
01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:59.300
<v Speaker 1>Like when your bones are exposed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got a problem.</v>

1673
01:18:59.330 --> 01:19:01.040
<v Speaker 1>It's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a real problem.</v>

1674
01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:04.610
<v Speaker 1>I used to cope with a guy that while he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was talking to you,</v>

1675
01:19:05.450 --> 01:19:06.283
<v Speaker 1>he'd have to get the straw and then put </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a paperclip and his nose because </v>

1676
01:19:09.591 --> 01:19:12.710
<v Speaker 1>the skin had collapsed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we had to pick the skin up,</v>

1677
01:19:12.920 --> 01:19:15.470
<v Speaker 1>put the dollar in there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then Snowden,</v>

1678
01:19:15.710 --> 01:19:19.490
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this was navy.</v>

1679
01:19:20.300 --> 01:19:21.710
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now he's missing this.</v>

1680
01:19:21.711 --> 01:19:26.030
<v Speaker 1>Knows like he ain't even breathe and eat</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking five.</v>

1681
01:19:26.060 --> 01:19:29.630
<v Speaker 1>Last time I spelled it with that guy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would have to pick up the wall from</v>

1682
01:19:30.290 --> 01:19:32.300
<v Speaker 1>Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Find out why they don't grow cocaine.</v>

1683
01:19:32.310 --> 01:19:34.000
<v Speaker 1>The United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that Shit.</v>

1684
01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:34.873
<v Speaker 1>Someone on the message where it says it </v>
<v Speaker 1>takes an acre of coca leaves to make a </v>

1685
01:19:36.981 --> 01:19:40.370
<v Speaker 1>kilo so that you need like slave labor </v>
<v Speaker 1>to collect process.</v>

1686
01:19:41.950 --> 01:19:43.630
<v Speaker 1>That does make some sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some brother,</v>

1687
01:19:43.670 --> 01:19:46.010
<v Speaker 1>they could do it here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would have done it trust.</v>

1688
01:19:46.930 --> 01:19:51.600
<v Speaker 1>They had the financing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've had the fucking money and that's</v>

1689
01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:53.840
<v Speaker 1>something they could have hit it back </v>
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

1690
01:19:53.910 --> 01:19:54.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1691
01:19:54.530 --> 01:19:55.363
<v Speaker 1>they can't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a reason why they can't do it </v>

1692
01:19:57.081 --> 01:19:58.660
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about the out the to this.</v>

1693
01:19:58.661 --> 01:20:02.090
<v Speaker 1>Something in the soil is some reason </v>
<v Speaker 1>both of those things,</v>

1694
01:20:02.091 --> 01:20:05.600
<v Speaker 1>if not some drug dealer with a high and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a chemist and said,</v>

1695
01:20:05.601 --> 01:20:07.920
<v Speaker 1>bring it over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some Chinese guy,</v>

1696
01:20:07.921 --> 01:20:10.440
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With tons of loot where they got another</v>

1697
01:20:10.441 --> 01:20:13.560
<v Speaker 1>genius Chinese guy 30 years ago and </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

1698
01:20:13.650 --> 01:20:17.290
<v Speaker 1>teach us how to grow this shit in Jersey</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's it.</v>

1699
01:20:17.291 --> 01:20:20.550
<v Speaker 1>It would have eliminated everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's some reason why,</v>

1700
01:20:20.790 --> 01:20:21.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just can't.</v>

1701
01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:22.913
<v Speaker 1>They made synthetic heroin yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you need that Chinese white shit on </v>

1702
01:20:27.841 --> 01:20:28.674
<v Speaker 1>this coast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have the Mexican that thought that </v>

1703
01:20:30.931 --> 01:20:33.270
<v Speaker 1>Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just shoot and you smoke.</v>

1704
01:20:33.720 --> 01:20:34.553
<v Speaker 1>But on the east coast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's that white powders with suburban </v>

1705
01:20:36.871 --> 01:20:37.704
<v Speaker 1>kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's what the models get hooked </v>

1706
01:20:39.181 --> 01:20:41.640
<v Speaker 1>on because it's two bunks and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

1707
01:20:42.540 --> 01:20:43.480
<v Speaker 1>You're done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1708
01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:46.310
<v Speaker 1>well now they're making a pure of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>never.</v>

1709
01:20:46.311 --> 01:20:46.810
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1710
01:20:46.810 --> 01:20:47.643
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's coming from Afghanistan </v>

1711
01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:49.321
<v Speaker 1>gum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1712
01:20:49.321 --> 01:20:49.790
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1713
01:20:49.790 --> 01:20:51.000
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>next war.</v>

1714
01:20:51.001 --> 01:20:53.490
<v Speaker 1>This last war when this started after </v>
<v Speaker 1>nine slash 11,</v>

1715
01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:56.640
<v Speaker 1>this picked up heroin again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It started coming in here again,</v>

1716
01:20:57.030 --> 01:20:57.863
<v Speaker 1>especially in the Detroit area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Detroit is not as fucked up as it is </v>

1717
01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:02.580
<v Speaker 1>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucked up.</v>

1718
01:21:03.070 --> 01:21:03.903
<v Speaker 1>It's because they just through heroin </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that I couldn't fucking handle it </v>

1719
01:21:06.511 --> 01:21:08.940
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the same thing happened in Newark.</v>

1720
01:21:08.941 --> 01:21:09.774
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey had happened in a couple </v>
<v Speaker 1>areas I know about because I have </v>

1721
01:21:12.391 --> 01:21:15.540
<v Speaker 1>friends that you and they'd tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>this and you're like,</v>

1722
01:21:15.570 --> 01:21:16.403
<v Speaker 1>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting that this happened </v>

1723
01:21:17.701 --> 01:21:18.540
<v Speaker 1>after nine slash 11.</v>

1724
01:21:19.010 --> 01:21:20.520
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1725
01:21:21.230 --> 01:21:22.700
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the production,</v>

1726
01:21:22.710 --> 01:21:23.543
<v Speaker 1>the heroine has gone through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The roof in Africa was done through the </v>

1727
01:21:25.411 --> 01:21:26.244
<v Speaker 1>roof now and there's all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons why they have excuses why they </v>

1728
01:21:28.171 --> 01:21:31.350
<v Speaker 1>let them do it or why it's happening or </v>
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>

1729
01:21:31.351 --> 01:21:32.184
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1730
01:21:32.380 --> 01:21:35.220
<v Speaker 1>the army helps them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So pills or at their all time,</v>

1731
01:21:35.221 --> 01:21:37.590
<v Speaker 1>highest and heroines at their all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Highest.</v>

1732
01:21:38.380 --> 01:21:41.730
<v Speaker 1>Or were they making the pills from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do they need actual heroin to make those</v>

1733
01:21:41.731 --> 01:21:42.564
<v Speaker 1>pills?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they need poppy seeds that need </v>

1734
01:21:44.741 --> 01:21:47.430
<v Speaker 1>something to a poppies to some of it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably something.</v>

1735
01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:49.200
<v Speaker 1>It's probably all synthetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1736
01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:50.700
<v Speaker 1>But what does that mean though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what,</v>

1737
01:21:50.701 --> 01:21:52.800
<v Speaker 1>where are they getting the compounds to </v>
<v Speaker 1>put it together?</v>

1738
01:21:52.801 --> 01:21:54.480
<v Speaker 1>Like what is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where did it come from?</v>

1739
01:21:54.481 --> 01:21:58.230
<v Speaker 1>And they have to have like a raw version</v>
<v Speaker 1>of something that turns into heroin.</v>

1740
01:21:58.231 --> 01:21:59.940
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean when you say synthetic,</v>

1741
01:21:59.941 --> 01:22:02.460
<v Speaker 1>it's not like you press a three d </v>
<v Speaker 1>printer and heroin comes out.</v>

1742
01:22:02.830 --> 01:22:03.663
<v Speaker 1>You have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There has to be things that they like a </v>

1743
01:22:06.451 --> 01:22:08.760
<v Speaker 1>lot of pharmaceuticals we think of them </v>
<v Speaker 1>as pharmaceuticals,</v>

1744
01:22:08.761 --> 01:22:09.594
<v Speaker 1>but a lot of them they're actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting some of the chemicals from </v>

1745
01:22:11.311 --> 01:22:12.970
<v Speaker 1>plants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1746
01:22:12.990 --> 01:22:15.650
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the reasons why they mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rain forest.</v>

1747
01:22:15.651 --> 01:22:16.484
<v Speaker 1>They're always looking for different </v>
<v Speaker 1>plants that they can exploit and they </v>

1748
01:22:19.051 --> 01:22:21.700
<v Speaker 1>can make pharmaceutical drugs out of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of like A.</v>

1749
01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:22.553
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I was a Hippie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of people had synthetic pod and I </v>

1750
01:22:26.010 --> 01:22:26.843
<v Speaker 1>don't know what that even means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think they just took the </v>

1751
01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:31.460
<v Speaker 1>compounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever makes you know,</v>

1752
01:22:32.130 --> 01:22:35.610
<v Speaker 1>a real pot and just recreate in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow.</v>

1753
01:22:35.950 --> 01:22:38.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it like ingredients?</v>

1754
01:22:38.340 --> 01:22:40.440
<v Speaker 1>Well there was a store that I read about</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coca Cola,</v>

1755
01:22:40.610 --> 01:22:43.050
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coca Cola uses real coca leaves.</v>

1756
01:22:43.350 --> 01:22:45.660
<v Speaker 1>Real coke is still today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still today.</v>

1757
01:22:45.870 --> 01:22:49.140
<v Speaker 1>They use real coca leaves and they don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have cocaine anymore.</v>

1758
01:22:49.380 --> 01:22:50.213
<v Speaker 1>What they do is they get these coca </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaves and they bring them to this </v>

1759
01:22:52.561 --> 01:22:56.460
<v Speaker 1>medical cocaine supplying and they take </v>
<v Speaker 1>the coke out,</v>

1760
01:22:56.461 --> 01:23:00.270
<v Speaker 1>sell that to New Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exact company in New Jersey and they put</v>

1761
01:23:00.271 --> 01:23:03.150
<v Speaker 1>it into pills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put it into medicine.</v>

1762
01:23:03.180 --> 01:23:06.010
<v Speaker 1>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's all coming from coca</v>

1763
01:23:06.010 --> 01:23:07.570
<v Speaker 2>leaves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really crazy.</v>

1764
01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:08.583
<v Speaker 2>Like you wouldn't have thought that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have thought that like synthetic </v>

1765
01:23:10.901 --> 01:23:14.250
<v Speaker 2>cocaine or line of can or whatever the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it is they're using,</v>

1766
01:23:14.530 --> 01:23:17.680
<v Speaker 2>which whatever versions of medical grade</v>
<v Speaker 2>cocaine they use,</v>

1767
01:23:17.890 --> 01:23:20.050
<v Speaker 2>he would've thought somehow know that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's coming from chemicals.</v>

1768
01:23:20.051 --> 01:23:21.790
<v Speaker 2>That's what we would think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's synthetic.</v>

1769
01:23:22.030 --> 01:23:24.370
<v Speaker 2>We always like to say shit like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what does that mean?</v>

1770
01:23:24.371 --> 01:23:29.371
<v Speaker 2>Like there's got to be like Ra compounds</v>
<v Speaker 2>that are used to make this stuff.</v>

1771
01:23:29.620 --> 01:23:32.740
<v Speaker 2>Where are those coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's coming from the origin.</v>

1772
01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:33.633
<v Speaker 2>I think synthetic means they take some </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the origin and they put other shit </v>

1773
01:23:36.951 --> 01:23:38.970
<v Speaker 2>and get the matching.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make it cheaper for you.</v>

1774
01:23:38.971 --> 01:23:39.804
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like when you go to the store now </v>

1775
01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:42.071
<v Speaker 2>and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hi,</v>

1776
01:23:42.071 --> 01:23:43.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm here to pick up my medication.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They go,</v>

1777
01:23:43.661 --> 01:23:44.494
<v Speaker 2>well we have to ask you a question and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want the original oxycotton or the </v>

1778
01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:49.313
<v Speaker 2>Melecan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the same only made in </v>

1779
01:23:50.501 --> 01:23:52.840
<v Speaker 2>Switzerland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but instead of $80,</v>

1780
01:23:52.841 --> 01:23:55.180
<v Speaker 2>the prescription is $28,000.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1781
01:23:56.410 --> 01:23:59.710
<v Speaker 2>So I shouldn't say synthetic heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Synthetic opiates.</v>

1782
01:24:04.250 --> 01:24:09.250
<v Speaker 2>Where do synthetic opiates come from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rived from opium.</v>

1783
01:24:10.220 --> 01:24:11.053
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a bunch that are derived from </v>

1784
01:24:12.261 --> 01:24:12.981
<v Speaker 2>opium.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1785
01:24:12.981 --> 01:24:15.530
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking bloody list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Morphine,</v>

1786
01:24:15.560 --> 01:24:16.730
<v Speaker 2>codeine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heroin,</v>

1787
01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:20.750
<v Speaker 2>t bain and or have been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

1788
01:24:21.230 --> 01:24:22.063
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know</v>

1789
01:24:23.430 --> 01:24:25.200
<v Speaker 2>coding,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heroin,</v>

1790
01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:28.560
<v Speaker 2>heroin and morphine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How similar are they?</v>

1791
01:24:30.650 --> 01:24:31.520
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the same.</v>

1792
01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:33.050
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I've heard.</v>

1793
01:24:33.051 --> 01:24:33.884
<v Speaker 2>I mean I don't use them obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that I've heard that's true that </v>

1794
01:24:35.661 --> 01:24:39.750
<v Speaker 2>I've done heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gay Cousin.</v>

1795
01:24:40.690 --> 01:24:44.990
<v Speaker 2>I was on a morphine drip when I go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the operated on my first time.</v>

1796
01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:46.640
<v Speaker 2>It was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

1797
01:24:46.641 --> 01:24:49.160
<v Speaker 2>I kept hitting that button.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He hit the button whenever you want.</v>

1798
01:24:49.190 --> 01:24:51.640
<v Speaker 2>This is like 1993.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They didn't regulate you,</v>

1799
01:24:52.890 --> 01:24:53.723
<v Speaker 2>so I was lying in this bed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My knee was killing me and I hit that </v>

1800
01:24:55.731 --> 01:24:58.620
<v Speaker 2>button and it would be like Nyquil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like taking Nyquil,</v>

1801
01:24:58.630 --> 01:25:02.000
<v Speaker 2>like clip clip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's probably what heroin.</v>

1802
01:25:02.001 --> 01:25:03.710
<v Speaker 2>So [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty sweet.</v>

1803
01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:05.390
<v Speaker 2>Let's do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I've done it.</v>

1804
01:25:05.660 --> 01:25:07.070
<v Speaker 2>So there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done heroin.</v>

1805
01:25:07.700 --> 01:25:09.970
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even think I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but then I remembered that uh,</v>

1806
01:25:10.030 --> 01:25:12.710
<v Speaker 2>that one night that I had to stay in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hospital and um,</v>

1807
01:25:12.830 --> 01:25:15.110
<v Speaker 2>I had my acl reconstructed.</v>

1808
01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:15.973
<v Speaker 2>That's where they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had me there and I was done with a </v>

1809
01:25:17.211 --> 01:25:19.610
<v Speaker 2>patellar tendon graft.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how they did it back then.</v>

1810
01:25:19.611 --> 01:25:20.444
<v Speaker 2>There was a good way to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes they still do it that way </v>

1811
01:25:21.771 --> 01:25:22.604
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're taking a chunk of bone off </v>

1812
01:25:24.261 --> 01:25:29.261
<v Speaker 2>my knee and a chunk of bone off my shin </v>
<v Speaker 2>and a sliver of my patella tendon.</v>

1813
01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:30.373
<v Speaker 2>And then they open you up like a fish </v>
<v Speaker 2>screw this piece of meat and use the </v>

1814
01:25:33.981 --> 01:25:34.814
<v Speaker 2>bone piece that they cut out of the Shin</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the bone piece that they cut out of </v>

1815
01:25:37.850 --> 01:25:38.683
<v Speaker 2>the a kneecap and then they reconstruct </v>
<v Speaker 2>the knee and it hurts like a </v>

1816
01:25:42.291 --> 01:25:43.400
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dude.</v>

1817
01:25:43.620 --> 01:25:44.680
<v Speaker 2>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1818
01:25:44.770 --> 01:25:45.603
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like lightning bolts shooting when </v>

1819
01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:50.610
<v Speaker 2>whenever you cut into bone and drills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's the one.</v>

1820
01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:52.760
<v Speaker 2>The other one that I had done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had done with the cadaver,</v>

1821
01:25:53.060 --> 01:25:54.680
<v Speaker 2>like way easier.</v>

1822
01:25:54.850 --> 01:25:56.630
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean like almost nothing.</v>

1823
01:25:56.840 --> 01:25:58.040
<v Speaker 2>Like I went to uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1824
01:25:58.041 --> 01:25:58.874
<v Speaker 2>Matt Lichtenberg,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to his birthday party five days </v>

1825
01:26:01.071 --> 01:26:03.620
<v Speaker 2>after the operation just walked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was fine.</v>

1826
01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:04.280
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1827
01:26:04.280 --> 01:26:06.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a brace on it.</v>

1828
01:26:06.051 --> 01:26:08.990
<v Speaker 2>I didn't want to hurt myself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't need crutches.</v>

1829
01:26:08.991 --> 01:26:12.930
<v Speaker 2>I could get around like it's totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>different than the Patella tendon graft.</v>

1830
01:26:12.931 --> 01:26:16.670
<v Speaker 2>Your leg blows up like a fucking blue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm lying in bed and they have me on</v>

1831
01:26:16.671 --> 01:26:17.504
<v Speaker 2>this continuous motion machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>From the moment you come into the </v>

1832
01:26:18.951 --> 01:26:20.740
<v Speaker 2>operating room,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they put you on a deal.</v>

1833
01:26:20.780 --> 01:26:21.613
<v Speaker 2>They don't want your leg to stiffen up </v>
<v Speaker 2>because then it's really hard to get to </v>

1834
01:26:23.380 --> 01:26:24.740
<v Speaker 2>get moving again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1835
01:26:24.741 --> 01:26:26.240
<v Speaker 2>once you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once you get really rigid,</v>

1836
01:26:26.480 --> 01:26:27.313
<v Speaker 2>you know the trauma sets in and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>really difficult to straighten your leg </v>

1837
01:26:29.841 --> 01:26:30.674
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So right away they have you on this </v>

1838
01:26:31.581 --> 01:26:32.500
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like boom,</v>

1839
01:26:32.550 --> 01:26:33.383
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

1840
01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:36.920
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So not only you in agony but your leg is</v>

1841
01:26:36.921 --> 01:26:38.510
<v Speaker 2>on this continuum machine.</v>

1842
01:26:41.390 --> 01:26:46.220
<v Speaker 2>More morphine is commonly related to his</v>
<v Speaker 2>morphine sulfate.</v>

1843
01:26:46.250 --> 01:26:47.083
<v Speaker 2>Heroin is diacetyl morphine that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heroin is simply morphine with an asset </v>

1844
01:26:51.591 --> 01:26:55.130
<v Speaker 2>whole molecule attach a subtle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>subtle,</v>

1845
01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:57.440
<v Speaker 2>subtle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more molecule attached.</v>

1846
01:26:57.530 --> 01:27:00.260
<v Speaker 2>So it's basically same shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It just is.</v>

1847
01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:03.140
<v Speaker 2>So it does it faster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1848
01:27:03.141 --> 01:27:03.974
<v Speaker 2>In terms of the effects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are exactly the same and medically </v>

1849
01:27:05.781 --> 01:27:07.880
<v Speaker 2>interchangeable except for the dosage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

1850
01:27:07.881 --> 01:27:12.110
<v Speaker 2>they're both converted to the same form </v>
<v Speaker 2>of morphine when they get into the body.</v>

1851
01:27:12.230 --> 01:27:13.690
<v Speaker 2>Fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thank you.</v>

1852
01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:14.590
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all this.</v>

1853
01:27:14.660 --> 01:27:15.320
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

1854
01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:19.670
<v Speaker 2>when you had surgery I had given you </v>
<v Speaker 2>heroin.</v>

1855
01:27:19.730 --> 01:27:21.110
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that amazing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Given your age,</v>

1856
01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.200
<v Speaker 2>different forum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the street level,</v>

1857
01:27:24.201 --> 01:27:27.680
<v Speaker 2>but it's a form of what you're getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>this tremendous.</v>

1858
01:27:27.830 --> 01:27:29.200
<v Speaker 2>Who doesn't like that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1859
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.823
<v Speaker 2>my friend's mom had a cancer and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she went through all the channels and </v>

1860
01:27:34.311 --> 01:27:35.144
<v Speaker 2>she was on her way out and she decided </v>
<v Speaker 2>to go out on her own by taking all and </v>

1861
01:27:37.681 --> 01:27:40.010
<v Speaker 2>morphine just said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1862
01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:41.270
<v Speaker 2>what a beautiful way to do it.</v>

1863
01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:42.920
<v Speaker 2>Just do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like this.</v>

1864
01:27:43.180 --> 01:27:44.030
<v Speaker 2>Just took it all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1865
01:27:44.031 --> 01:27:44.864
<v Speaker 2>they were giving her something for pain </v>
<v Speaker 2>and I guess she had enough to stop the </v>

1866
01:27:47.691 --> 01:27:50.960
<v Speaker 2>thicker and she just says enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just like,</v>

1867
01:27:50.961 --> 01:27:52.340
<v Speaker 2>I'm wasting away you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She goes,</v>

1868
01:27:52.341 --> 01:27:53.960
<v Speaker 2>there's no hope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it's over.</v>

1869
01:27:54.050 --> 01:27:55.310
<v Speaker 2>Like her body was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was over.</v>

1870
01:27:55.311 --> 01:27:58.760
<v Speaker 2>It was like the last few days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's how she decided to do it.</v>

1871
01:27:58.820 --> 01:28:00.230
<v Speaker 2>You got to respect that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1872
01:28:00.490 --> 01:28:02.750
<v Speaker 2>like the fact that that's illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1873
01:28:02.751 --> 01:28:05.930
<v Speaker 2>I know it would be abused.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know it could be abused by people that</v>

1874
01:28:05.931 --> 01:28:07.300
<v Speaker 2>want to kill people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1875
01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:08.840
<v Speaker 2>all my mom wanted to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1876
01:28:09.110 --> 01:28:12.710
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could run into those types of people</v>

1877
01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:13.813
<v Speaker 2>that would actually kill family member </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get some money from the will kill a </v>

1878
01:28:15.981 --> 01:28:17.420
<v Speaker 2>wife,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1879
01:28:17.480 --> 01:28:18.920
<v Speaker 2>those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those kinds of things.</v>

1880
01:28:19.310 --> 01:28:22.430
<v Speaker 2>But I think that still for someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>dying,</v>

1881
01:28:22.490 --> 01:28:23.201
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for your,</v>

1882
01:28:23.201 --> 01:28:24.034
<v Speaker 2>your mom or something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it's the last days and you got to </v>

1883
01:28:26.091 --> 01:28:30.440
<v Speaker 2>watch her just in agony constantly with </v>
<v Speaker 2>no light at the end of the tunnel,</v>

1884
01:28:30.441 --> 01:28:31.274
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's 90 years old or whatever the hell </v>

1885
01:28:32.091 --> 01:28:34.710
<v Speaker 2>she is like fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you,</v>

1886
01:28:34.730 --> 01:28:37.340
<v Speaker 2>you gotta have a heart man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shit should be legal.</v>

1887
01:28:37.350 --> 01:28:40.280
<v Speaker 2>You should be able to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in some places it is,</v>

1888
01:28:40.281 --> 01:28:41.480
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's legal in Oregon,</v>

1889
01:28:41.710 --> 01:28:43.430
<v Speaker 2>like there was at one girl that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to um,</v>

1890
01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:45.620
<v Speaker 2>do that change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Moved to Oregon.</v>

1891
01:28:45.890 --> 01:28:46.850
<v Speaker 2>Did she do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1892
01:28:46.860 --> 01:28:50.290
<v Speaker 2>she ended up delaying it a couple days </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then she and she did it.</v>

1893
01:28:53.570 --> 01:28:54.403
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you gotta be there to really </v>

1894
01:28:56.061 --> 01:28:56.894
<v Speaker 2>make a decision on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just some people get tired of </v>

1895
01:29:01.171 --> 01:29:02.310
<v Speaker 2>fighting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1896
01:29:02.311 --> 01:29:05.730
<v Speaker 2>you get tired or you get weary from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>illness just draining you.</v>

1897
01:29:05.731 --> 01:29:09.600
<v Speaker 2>And then the chemotherapy drains you </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes even further.</v>

1898
01:29:09.850 --> 01:29:11.030
<v Speaker 2>And it's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1899
01:29:11.031 --> 01:29:11.864
<v Speaker 2>the last days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's amazing is how many people </v>

1900
01:29:13.801 --> 01:29:17.610
<v Speaker 2>benefit from cbd for marijuana and how </v>
<v Speaker 2>few people are getting it.</v>

1901
01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:19.133
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more I read about this and the more </v>

1902
01:29:20.191 --> 01:29:25.170
<v Speaker 2>I talk to people that have had it and </v>
<v Speaker 2>talk to people that have loved ones that</v>

1903
01:29:25.171 --> 01:29:28.530
<v Speaker 2>have tried it on cancer and had </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible results can be.</v>

1904
01:29:28.531 --> 01:29:29.364
<v Speaker 2>It just drives me nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just so hard to believe that that </v>

1905
01:29:31.201 --> 01:29:32.034
<v Speaker 2>stuff's still demonized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that people are still pretending that </v>

1906
01:29:33.841 --> 01:29:38.190
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the worst things that </v>
<v Speaker 2>society can make legal where for just if</v>

1907
01:29:38.191 --> 01:29:40.860
<v Speaker 2>it only did that with cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>forget about the getting high part.</v>

1908
01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:41.933
<v Speaker 2>If it only did that for cancer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know how magical that drug would </v>

1909
01:29:44.821 --> 01:29:47.970
<v Speaker 2>it be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's got this creepy passed.</v>

1910
01:29:48.150 --> 01:29:48.983
<v Speaker 2>It's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a stripper that wrote the most amazing </v>

1911
01:29:50.431 --> 01:29:51.900
<v Speaker 2>book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nobody wants to listen to it because</v>

1912
01:29:51.901 --> 01:29:52.734
<v Speaker 2>she used to be a stripper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's got like marijuana has this like </v>

1913
01:29:55.710 --> 01:29:56.543
<v Speaker 2>seedy part to it and that CD part keeps </v>
<v Speaker 2>people from recognizing the textile use </v>

1914
01:30:02.730 --> 01:30:06.810
<v Speaker 2>the uses as a commodity they use for </v>
<v Speaker 2>making houses they use for food.</v>

1915
01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:09.870
<v Speaker 2>Like if it was just all those things and</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't get people high,</v>

1916
01:30:10.050 --> 01:30:10.883
<v Speaker 2>it would be our all time favorite plant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be the number one plant in the </v>

1917
01:30:13.351 --> 01:30:15.150
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We would be using it all the time.</v>

1918
01:30:15.390 --> 01:30:17.640
<v Speaker 2>They say that this hempcrete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever heard of him?</v>

1919
01:30:17.641 --> 01:30:19.110
<v Speaker 2>Crete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Concrete they make with him.</v>

1920
01:30:19.710 --> 01:30:20.790
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1921
01:30:20.850 --> 01:30:25.850
<v Speaker 2>some of the most durable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lightweight fire resistant insulation.</v>

1922
01:30:25.980 --> 01:30:26.260
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1923
01:30:26.260 --> 01:30:28.470
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's great insulated properties,</v>

1924
01:30:28.471 --> 01:30:32.790
<v Speaker 2>insulation properties and it's made out </v>
<v Speaker 2>of hemp and you can make it cheap.</v>

1925
01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:33.600
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't,</v>

1926
01:30:33.600 --> 01:30:34.950
<v Speaker 2>doesn't cost a lot of money to grow </v>
<v Speaker 2>hemp.</v>

1927
01:30:34.951 --> 01:30:35.784
<v Speaker 2>They just can't grow it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like in that you can't even get high </v>

1928
01:30:37.081 --> 01:30:38.100
<v Speaker 2>from this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1929
01:30:38.101 --> 01:30:40.050
<v Speaker 2>it's really crazy if you stopped and </v>
<v Speaker 2>thought about it,</v>

1930
01:30:40.170 --> 01:30:41.003
<v Speaker 2>if it was a plot in a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there was something that was as </v>

1931
01:30:42.841 --> 01:30:43.674
<v Speaker 2>powerful as the marijuana plant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was something that had so many </v>

1932
01:30:45.991 --> 01:30:46.824
<v Speaker 2>benefits and it was somehow another kept</v>
<v Speaker 2>illegal and somehow none of the </v>

1933
01:30:49.681 --> 01:30:50.514
<v Speaker 2>propaganda kept people thinking that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>would be one of the worst things for </v>

1934
01:30:52.921 --> 01:30:55.020
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they were to make this legal,</v>

1935
01:30:55.050 --> 01:30:56.330
<v Speaker 2>you would lose your fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would.</v>

1936
01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:59.070
<v Speaker 2>You would go to this movie stupid like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this movie is dumb.</v>

1937
01:30:59.250 --> 01:31:00.850
<v Speaker 2>People would riot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wouldn't do it,</v>

1938
01:31:00.851 --> 01:31:03.740
<v Speaker 2>and come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got something that cures epilepsy in</v>

1939

01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:06.960
<v Speaker 2>Little kids that have epilepsy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen any different?</v>

1941
01:31:06.961 --> 01:31:09.600
<v Speaker 2>Fucking kids have benefited johnny </v>
<v Speaker 2>rotten.</v>

1942
01:31:09.601 --> 01:31:10.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our buddy johnny,</v>

1943
01:31:11.100 --> 01:31:12.960
<v Speaker 2>his kid was having all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>seizures.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He moves up to Seattle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets them on the medical marijuana </v>

01:31:15.511 --> 01:31:17.610
<v Speaker 2>program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Boom goes away.</v>

1946
01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:18.833
<v Speaker 2>It goes away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It gets 100 times better and the kid </v>

1947
01:31:19.981 --> 01:31:21.750
<v Speaker 2>starts communicating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>changed his life,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Fuck man.</v>

1949
01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:24.713
<v Speaker 2>It's just weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the weirdest parts about </v>

1950
01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:30.420
<v Speaker 2>being alive in 2015 is that there's so </v>
<v Speaker 2>many improvements going on.</v>

1951
01:31:30.690 --> 01:31:31.523
<v Speaker 2>There's so much fascinating shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening in our culture and yet this </v>

1952
01:31:33.781 --> 01:31:34.614
<v Speaker 2>one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like this hold out this clawing </v>

1953
01:31:37.381 --> 01:31:41.190
<v Speaker 2>thing that cleans to the sword.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not that.</v>

1954
01:31:41.790 --> 01:31:46.230
<v Speaker 2>It's the people's reaction that gets me </v>
<v Speaker 2>still like I'm the type of guy that,</v>

1955
01:31:46.231 --> 01:31:49.350
<v Speaker 2>you know what man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't eat Sushi till 1995,</v>

1956
01:31:49.351 --> 01:31:51.270
<v Speaker 2>but I came around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1957
01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:53.610
<v Speaker 2>when I was in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck you raw fish.</v>

1958
01:31:53.640 --> 01:31:54.930
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Real fresh.</v>

1959
01:31:55.710 --> 01:31:58.790
<v Speaker 2>You know what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then one day I came around,</v>

1960
01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:00.250
<v Speaker 2>I never said I hated Sushi.</v>

1961
01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:01.900
<v Speaker 5>I just said it wasn't for me at the </v>
<v Speaker 5>time.</v>

1962
01:32:02.230 --> 01:32:05.140
<v Speaker 5>And you listen to a fucking moron like </v>
<v Speaker 5>governor Christie,</v>

1963
01:32:05.500 --> 01:32:06.333
<v Speaker 5>who just aggravates me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It aggravates me that this guy is </v>

1964
01:32:08.171 --> 01:32:10.380
<v Speaker 5>running for president this fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>years.</v>

1965
01:32:10.390 --> 01:32:13.300
<v Speaker 5>President fucking list is horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thank God I'm.</v>

1966
01:32:13.301 --> 01:32:14.134
<v Speaker 5>I'm happy I got felonies to vote like </v>
<v Speaker 5>these motherfuckers from the Cuban dude </v>

1967
01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:24.200
<v Speaker 5>to Christie will bad shape those </v>
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous.</v>

1968
01:32:24.840 --> 01:32:26.860
<v Speaker 5>A ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous person.</v>

1969
01:32:26.890 --> 01:32:28.600
<v Speaker 5>He's so ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my God,</v>

1970
01:32:28.601 --> 01:32:31.030
<v Speaker 5>I cannot fight.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm so happy I don't live in Jersey,</v>

1971
01:32:31.031 --> 01:32:32.560
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm so fucking happy,</v>

1972
01:32:32.710 --> 01:32:33.543
<v Speaker 5>but you know when he's so marked I just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't imagine him ever and he's got </v>

1973
01:32:36.970 --> 01:32:37.803
<v Speaker 5>that whole bridge things gonna hold them</v>
<v Speaker 5>back so that he's not going to get </v>

1974
01:32:39.821 --> 01:32:40.654
<v Speaker 5>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But what he will do in doing this as </v>

1975
01:32:42.731 --> 01:32:46.870
<v Speaker 5>raise his public profile and maybe he's </v>
<v Speaker 5>pretty good at debating.</v>

1976
01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:47.973
<v Speaker 5>He's pretty good at talking and maybe if</v>
<v Speaker 5>he has these conversations in front of </v>

1977
01:32:51.101 --> 01:32:52.110
<v Speaker 5>America,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1978
01:32:52.120 --> 01:32:53.620
<v Speaker 5>the way he's been having them in New </v>
<v Speaker 5>Jersey,</v>

1979
01:32:53.621 --> 01:32:56.290
<v Speaker 5>maybe in a big public forum like </v>
<v Speaker 5>presidential debates,</v>

1980
01:32:56.620 --> 01:32:57.670
<v Speaker 5>it can be kind of interesting.</v>

1981
01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:01.600
<v Speaker 5>Could be interesting to hear him talk </v>
<v Speaker 5>because he as Moronica as he is,</v>

1982
01:33:01.630 --> 01:33:03.910
<v Speaker 5>he still a very good talker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1983
01:33:03.911 --> 01:33:04.490
<v Speaker 5>he gets,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1984
01:33:04.490 --> 01:33:07.090
<v Speaker 5>I disagree with a lot of the shit that </v>
<v Speaker 5>he says,</v>

1985
01:33:07.390 --> 01:33:10.960
<v Speaker 5>but I got to respect the fact that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>guy knows how to communicate sometimes.</v>

1986
01:33:10.961 --> 01:33:12.740
<v Speaker 5>That's all you need in this goofy ass </v>
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>

1987
01:33:12.741 --> 01:33:16.090
<v Speaker 5>Somebody writes you a good juicy script.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have a bunch of people behind you.</v>

1988
01:33:16.091 --> 01:33:18.700
<v Speaker 5>They give you a little makeover.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They tried to do that with them.</v>

1989
01:33:18.701 --> 01:33:20.710
<v Speaker 5>They got them on that fucking belly </v>
<v Speaker 5>band,</v>

1990
01:33:20.980 --> 01:33:23.680
<v Speaker 5>but somehow or another it didn't work </v>
<v Speaker 5>like he still big.</v>

1991
01:33:24.490 --> 01:33:26.260
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean he did get on that.</v>

1992
01:33:26.261 --> 01:33:27.094
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Find out if he did that because that's </v>

1993
01:33:28.451 --> 01:33:29.740
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is.</v>

1994
01:33:29.741 --> 01:33:32.380
<v Speaker 5>The way I look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I grew up in northern New Jersey.</v>

1995
01:33:32.860 --> 01:33:37.860
<v Speaker 5>I grew up in politicians home and I know</v>
<v Speaker 5>that to be a politician in New Jersey,</v>

1996
01:33:38.590 --> 01:33:39.423
<v Speaker 5>somewhere along the line you got to take</v>
<v Speaker 5>an envelope and when you're running for </v>

1997
01:33:44.711 --> 01:33:45.544
<v Speaker 5>president,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's pretty tough to take an envelope </v>

1998
01:33:47.171 --> 01:33:48.160
<v Speaker 5>and people have to fuck them.</v>

1999
01:33:48.160 --> 01:33:48.993
<v Speaker 5>Raised their hand.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like Donald Trump when he raised </v>

2000
01:33:52.091 --> 01:33:54.190
<v Speaker 5>his hand,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could not believe it.</v>

2001
01:33:54.750 --> 01:33:55.583
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just what he did in New York in the </v>

2002
01:33:57.940 --> 01:33:59.110
<v Speaker 5>eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2003
01:33:59.140 --> 01:33:59.973
<v Speaker 5>if that guy even moved.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What did he do in New York and in New </v>

2004
01:34:02.380 --> 01:34:04.990
<v Speaker 5>York in the eighties when he was </v>
<v Speaker 5>building all those things.</v>

2005

<v Speaker 5>doing all of that developing.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Twenty $200.</v>

2038
01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:04.550
<v Speaker 5>That's how high the construction costs </v>

<v Speaker 5>organized crime.</v>

2041
01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:13.790
<v Speaker 5>So somewhere along the line this trump </v>
<v Speaker 5>was embedded with organized crime.</v>

2042
01:36:14.020 --> 01:36:14.853
<v Speaker 5>Had to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>had to be the trump plaza in Atlantic </v>

01:36:21.201 --> 01:36:22.034
<v Speaker 5>I always knew this idiot did not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Could not raise his fucking hand and if </v>

2046
01:36:26.331 --> 01:36:29.690
<v Speaker 5>anybody is smart,</v>
<v Speaker 5>go to the Sammy the bull book.</v>

2047
01:36:30.050 --> 01:36:33.550
<v Speaker 5>He talks about it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not so many ways really,</v>

2048
01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:38.300
<v Speaker 5>so I guaranteed the feds have their </v>
<v Speaker 5>files and as soon as this guy moves up a</v>

2049
01:36:38.301 --> 01:36:40.800
<v Speaker 5>little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're going to take a look at it.</v>

2050
01:36:40.810 --> 01:36:43.910
<v Speaker 5>It says a sammy the bull told us,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how can we take care of this?</v>

2051
01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:49.520
<v Speaker 5>A donation to the fucking a buffalo bull</v>
<v Speaker 5>company or fucking blind kids.</v>

2052
01:36:49.521 --> 01:36:50.354
<v Speaker 5>Whatever the fuck it takes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because this guy was the major </v>

2053
01:36:53.571 --> 01:36:57.590
<v Speaker 5>contractor in New York in the eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All these small businesses,</v>

2054
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:59.780
<v Speaker 5>he put their lights out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know how I know.</v>

2055
01:37:00.230 --> 01:37:03.560
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you how I know for a fact when</v>
<v Speaker 5>I got locked up,</v>

2056
01:37:03.590 --> 01:37:04.423
<v Speaker 5>one of the conditions of me getting out </v>
<v Speaker 5>was I had to get a job to alleviate the </v>

2057
01:37:07.761 --> 01:37:10.310
<v Speaker 5>state of Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My attorney came up with this paper,</v>

2058
01:37:10.340 --> 01:37:14.510
<v Speaker 5>listen to if you let him out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he'll leave next week.</v>

2059
01:37:15.530 --> 01:37:17.750
<v Speaker 5>Tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We've got a plan for him.</v>

2060
01:37:17.780 --> 01:37:19.490
<v Speaker 5>As soon as he gets out of your fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>jail,</v>

2061
01:37:19.491 --> 01:37:21.890
<v Speaker 5>we'll take them out of new job.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We'll get them back to New Jersey.</v>

2062
01:37:22.330 --> 01:37:23.163
<v Speaker 5>But to do all this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have a promise of employment and I </v>

2063
01:37:26.691 --> 01:37:27.524
<v Speaker 5>called around New Jersey and my friend's</v>
<v Speaker 5>uncle had a window door trim sash </v>

2064
01:37:31.971 --> 01:37:34.130
<v Speaker 5>company,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know all this shit for your door,</v>

2065
01:37:34.131 --> 01:37:34.964
<v Speaker 5>that's a sash on the bottom by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and trim around your door and the door </v>

2066
01:37:38.301 --> 01:37:42.980
<v Speaker 5>and and shades and they sold all that </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff and they had like an 11 man crew,</v>

2067
01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:44.600
<v Speaker 5>like six guys on phones.</v>

2068
01:37:45.410 --> 01:37:46.590
<v Speaker 5>So he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you want to go?</v>

2069
01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:50.020
<v Speaker 5>He made me send me the resume.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That guy's uncle and I called him.</v>

2070
01:37:50.030 --> 01:37:54.260
<v Speaker 5>We spoke on the phone and in fact I </v>
<v Speaker 5>wrote the guy while I was in prison back</v>

2071
01:37:54.261 --> 01:37:56.490
<v Speaker 5>and forth because he would tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>keep your head up.</v>

2072
01:37:56.491 --> 01:37:59.790
<v Speaker 5>You got a job when you get out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>don't be down on yourself.</v>

2073
01:37:59.791 --> 01:38:01.590
<v Speaker 5>When I got out of the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>into the halfway house,</v>

2074
01:38:01.591 --> 01:38:03.060
<v Speaker 5>I called him and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey man,</v>

2075
01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:05.670
<v Speaker 5>I got to sit in the halfway house but 90</v>
<v Speaker 5>days,</v>

2076
01:38:05.671 --> 01:38:07.560
<v Speaker 5>but I'll be in Jersey by June.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he goes,</v>

2077
01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:08.513
<v Speaker 5>I don't think I got high.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We were working on this construction </v>

2078
01:38:10.861 --> 01:38:14.230
<v Speaker 5>company and we got stiffed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was that fucking guy trump.</v>

2079
01:38:15.900 --> 01:38:18.140
<v Speaker 5>We lost everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We had any investment really.</v>

2080
01:38:18.310 --> 01:38:19.590
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these were high rises.</v>

2081
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:22.440
<v Speaker 5>You had to pay for all those windows and</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's only paid,</v>

2082
01:38:23.110 --> 01:38:23.943
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they might have got a deposit or </v>

2083
01:38:24.481 --> 01:38:26.910
<v Speaker 5>something from the GC,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but not enough.</v>

2084
01:38:26.910 --> 01:38:29.400
<v Speaker 5>They got stamped and then just put them </v>
<v Speaker 5>under.</v>

2085
01:38:29.460 --> 01:38:30.750
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he would go onto,</v>

2086
01:38:30.780 --> 01:38:31.613
<v Speaker 5>like he would go to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was the top builder and he would go </v>

2087
01:38:33.661 --> 01:38:36.740
<v Speaker 5>to Joe Rogan construction and he would </v>
<v Speaker 5>put it all on your name.</v>

2088
01:38:36.780 --> 01:38:40.130
<v Speaker 5>So you went down to wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So he done all this.</v>

2089
01:38:40.140 --> 01:38:44.640
<v Speaker 5>He ruined fucking family businesses and </v>
<v Speaker 5>all of a sudden he has this short memory</v>

2090
01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:45.633
<v Speaker 5>when you run for president,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they look at you in a fucking a </v>

2091
01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:50.333
<v Speaker 5>microscope microscope and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know what happened with the </v>

2092
01:38:52.201 --> 01:38:54.750
<v Speaker 5>birth certificate and Obama's birth.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never paid attention,</v>

2093
01:38:55.650 --> 01:38:56.483
<v Speaker 5>but he was born in Kenya.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is something you cannot overlook </v>

2094
01:38:59.461 --> 01:39:00.840
<v Speaker 5>with this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This guy's a prick.</v>

2095
01:39:00.841 --> 01:39:03.810
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't know any fucking this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well he was,</v>

2096
01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:07.950
<v Speaker 5>he was one of the guys that was going on</v>
<v Speaker 5>and on about Obama's birth certificate.</v>

2097
01:39:08.370 --> 01:39:10.080
<v Speaker 5>He was like one of the main guys,</v>

2098
01:39:12.180 --> 01:39:15.560
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't look,</v>

2099
01:39:15.660 --> 01:39:18.490
<v Speaker 2>just look at them as human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when you hear them talk and you,</v>

2100
01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:21.860
<v Speaker 2>you kinda like what they stand for.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's my favorite president ever.</v>

2101
01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:24.260
<v Speaker 2>Who Obama better than Clinton?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2102
01:39:24.750 --> 01:39:26.660
<v Speaker 2>I think Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2103
01:39:26.910 --> 01:39:27.743
<v Speaker 2>Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had a lot of flavor and he did some </v>

2104
01:39:29.281 --> 01:39:33.170
<v Speaker 2>good stuff too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think Obama has been the most.</v>

2105
01:39:33.210 --> 01:39:36.090
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's just the times that we're in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the most,</v>

2106
01:39:36.510 --> 01:39:41.510
<v Speaker 2>the most noticeable when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>like spreading this like what I think is</v>

2107
01:39:41.701 --> 01:39:43.560
<v Speaker 2>like an improvement in the way people </v>
<v Speaker 2>think,</v>

2108
01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:45.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>first of all by being black.</v>

2109
01:39:45.781 --> 01:39:49.180
<v Speaker 2>Second of all by supportive gay rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really like blatant support.</v>

2110
01:39:49.181 --> 01:39:52.410
<v Speaker 2>Like where they turn the fucking White </v>
<v Speaker 2>House rainbow when it got passed.</v>

2111
01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:55.770
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's crazy shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's never existed before.</v>

2112
01:39:55.771 --> 01:39:56.604
<v Speaker 2>When you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you saw that picture of the White </v>

2113
01:39:58.110 --> 01:40:00.030
<v Speaker 2>House being rainbow colored at night and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2114
01:40:00.031 --> 01:40:01.290
<v Speaker 2>this is nuts man.</v>

2115
01:40:01.290 --> 01:40:02.123
<v Speaker 2>That wouldn't happen with Nixon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is some shit that similar to the </v>

2116
01:40:04.471 --> 01:40:07.350
<v Speaker 2>fucking abolition of slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's similar.</v>

2117
01:40:07.740 --> 01:40:10.620
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not as extreme a slavery,</v>

2118
01:40:10.621 --> 01:40:13.560
<v Speaker 2>it's not as extreme of trap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so amazing.</v>

2119
01:40:14.390 --> 01:40:15.223
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's similar in the way that it's </v>

2120
01:40:16.441 --> 01:40:20.610
<v Speaker 2>going to change the way people look at </v>
<v Speaker 2>gay people.</v>

2121
01:40:20.850 --> 01:40:22.410
<v Speaker 2>It's going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might not be now,</v>

2122
01:40:22.440 --> 01:40:25.170
<v Speaker 2>it might not be the generation of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>parents.</v>

2123
01:40:25.440 --> 01:40:27.230
<v Speaker 2>It might not be the generation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2124
01:40:27.240 --> 01:40:28.073
<v Speaker 2>of our older brothers and sisters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's going to be the generation of </v>

2125
01:40:30.151 --> 01:40:30.984
<v Speaker 2>our kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The generation of our kids is going to </v>

2126
01:40:32.671 --> 01:40:33.504
<v Speaker 2>understand that gay people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like being mad at people for </v>

2127
01:40:34.921 --> 01:40:37.350
<v Speaker 2>having red hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just who they are.</v>

2128
01:40:37.590 --> 01:40:38.940
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you give a fuck?</v>

2129
01:40:39.150 --> 01:40:39.983
<v Speaker 2>And if you give a fuck about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what else are you gonna come creep it </v>

2130
01:40:42.481 --> 01:40:44.910
<v Speaker 2>around about what are you going to fuck </v>
<v Speaker 2>with people about?</v>

2131
01:40:45.030 --> 01:40:47.130
<v Speaker 2>What is it you're going to fuck with </v>
<v Speaker 2>people about the way they're dressed?</v>

2132
01:40:47.330 --> 01:40:49.140
<v Speaker 2>They're going to fuck with people about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the way they talk.</v>

2133
01:40:49.141 --> 01:40:51.930
<v Speaker 2>Like what is it like leave people the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck alone.</v>

2134
01:40:51.931 --> 01:40:54.010
<v Speaker 2>And the more we do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more we could</v>

2135
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:57.070
<v Speaker 1>sort it all out and find out what is </v>
<v Speaker 1>really bothering us.</v>

2136
01:40:57.220 --> 01:40:58.053
<v Speaker 1>What's really bothering people was a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of what's bothering people as people </v>

2137
01:41:00.191 --> 01:41:01.024
<v Speaker 1>intruding on other people's lives and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't get any more inclusive than in </v>

2138
01:41:04.421 --> 01:41:07.930
<v Speaker 1>the fucking bedroom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're intruding on people's bedrooms.</v>

2139
01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:08.913
<v Speaker 1>You care if people want to get married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they love each other just because </v>

2140
01:41:11.171 --> 01:41:12.004
<v Speaker 1>they're two guys or two girls who gives </v>
<v Speaker 1>a fuck and if you do give a fuck Europe </v>

2141
01:41:16.020 --> 01:41:16.853
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're a problem in this free world and </v>

2142
01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:20.793
<v Speaker 1>this is just one thing that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideologically attached yourself to and </v>

2143
01:41:24.671 --> 01:41:25.504
<v Speaker 1>it might be religious based and my who </v>
<v Speaker 1>knows what the fuck other shit you got </v>

2144
01:41:28.841 --> 01:41:30.670
<v Speaker 1>going on in your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't want people to do.</v>

2145
01:41:30.820 --> 01:41:31.653
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows what other weird kind of </v>

2146
01:41:32.681 --> 01:41:35.980
<v Speaker 1>sharia law shit you want to incorporate </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the society.</v>

2147
01:41:35.981 --> 01:41:37.300
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2148
01:41:37.550 --> 01:41:38.383
<v Speaker 1>You think people shouldn't be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get married just because there are two </v>

2149
01:41:40.061 --> 01:41:44.110
<v Speaker 1>men or two women that's intolerable in </v>
<v Speaker 1>2015.</v>

2150
01:41:44.140 --> 01:41:44.973
<v Speaker 1>That's Archaic Shit and I think that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the archaic things that's going </v>

2151
01:41:48.411 --> 01:41:51.220
<v Speaker 1>to slowly but surely start vanishing </v>
<v Speaker 1>from our world.</v>

2152
01:41:51.730 --> 01:41:53.410
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not now.</v>

2153
01:41:53.440 --> 01:41:55.750
<v Speaker 1>There's still a lot of homophobia now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2154
01:41:55.751 --> 01:41:59.230
<v Speaker 1>there's this woman from Brazil who's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did an interview,</v>

2155
01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:01.360
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think it was Jessica on Drudge,</v>

2156
01:42:01.810 --> 01:42:02.643
<v Speaker 1>a MMA fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she was talking about how many </v>

2157
01:42:05.111 --> 01:42:08.950
<v Speaker 1>people in Brazil are homophobic in </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparison to United States.</v>

2158
01:42:09.220 --> 01:42:10.053
<v Speaker 1>And she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really nice to see the United </v>

2159
01:42:11.290 --> 01:42:14.680
<v Speaker 1>States doing this and hopefully more </v>
<v Speaker 1>people in Brazil think this way too.</v>

2160
01:42:14.940 --> 01:42:17.710
<v Speaker 1>And he realized that a lot of Latin </v>
<v Speaker 1>American countries,</v>

2161
01:42:17.711 --> 01:42:19.900
<v Speaker 1>especially like you were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cuba,</v>

2162
01:42:20.770 --> 01:42:22.330
<v Speaker 1>you were talking to me the other night </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Cuba.</v>

<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2167
01:42:29.830 --> 01:42:33.760
<v Speaker 1>something completely new to some people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't affect me.</v>

2168
01:42:34.150 --> 01:42:36.090
<v Speaker 1>So it doesn't bother me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2169
01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:37.033
<v Speaker 1>Like I said it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my joke on stage I lived next to </v>

2170
01:42:38.621 --> 01:42:41.150

<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

2171
01:42:41.160 --> 01:42:43.690

01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:50.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2175
01:42:50.351 --> 01:42:53.620
<v Speaker 1>but there's some people were still </v>
<v Speaker 1>living in 19 fucking 17 man.</v>

2176
01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:54.513
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those people are stuck in their own </v>

2177
01:42:55.841 --> 01:42:57.460
<v Speaker 1>fucking lunch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I just keep walking,</v>

2178
01:42:58.310 --> 01:42:59.710
<v Speaker 1>just keep walking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do?</v>

2179
01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:01.450
<v Speaker 1>And everyday they watched the longest </v>
<v Speaker 1>yard,</v>

2180
01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:05.320
<v Speaker 1>long for the days when you could smash a</v>
<v Speaker 1>chick's face against the wall.</v>

2181
01:43:05.410 --> 01:43:10.410
<v Speaker 1>I was explained to you the other day </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the most foremost community in Cuba</v>

2182
01:43:10.691 --> 01:43:11.860
<v Speaker 1>is the gay community.</v>

2183
01:43:12.340 --> 01:43:14.560
<v Speaker 1>I grew up with gay Cubans around me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my mom,</v>

2184
01:43:14.750 --> 01:43:16.730
<v Speaker 1>my mom at the fucking bar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

2185
01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:19.750
<v Speaker 1>Buckle keeps the lights on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>White dudes in the daytime.</v>

2186
01:43:19.751 --> 01:43:21.520
<v Speaker 1>Those gay fucks that come in and spend </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2187
01:43:21.590 --> 01:43:23.930
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in those days that were doing blow,</v>

2188
01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:25.930
<v Speaker 1>that was selling blow and I grew up </v>
<v Speaker 1>around them.</v>

2189
01:43:25.931 --> 01:43:27.640
<v Speaker 1>I never had any hatred or anything for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

2190
01:43:28.450 --> 01:43:32.200
<v Speaker 1>But my stepfather,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he used from the other side of the cube.</v>

2191
01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:35.560
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where they can't be in a room with a gay</v>

2192
01:43:35.561 --> 01:43:36.580
<v Speaker 1>guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no hatred,</v>

2193
01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:38.033
<v Speaker 1>no whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they just can't be in the room that </v>

2194
01:43:39.821 --> 01:43:42.730
<v Speaker 1>manhood and not be in a room with a gay </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

2195
01:43:43.030 --> 01:43:44.830
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I get it.</v>

2196
01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:46.233
<v Speaker 1>Some Latin American countries is just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But who are the biggest gay guys in the </v>

2197
01:43:48.851 --> 01:43:50.620
<v Speaker 1>world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking Lens.</v>

2198
01:43:50.770 --> 01:43:52.160
<v Speaker 1>They're the ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

2199
01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:54.930
<v Speaker 2>what do you think that is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it's the whole thing?</v>

2200
01:43:55.150 --> 01:43:56.660
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it like in Sicily?</v>

2201
01:43:56.720 --> 01:43:59.150
<v Speaker 2>On that island?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would it be like in 1950?</v>

2202
01:43:59.151 --> 01:44:01.550
<v Speaker 2>The big gains.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sicily to bang each other a lot.</v>

2203
01:44:01.730 --> 01:44:04.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't fucking think so.</v>

2204
01:44:04.131 --> 01:44:07.340
<v Speaker 2>I think that's where the Catholics are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think that you'd be.</v>

2205
01:44:07.970 --> 01:44:10.520
<v Speaker 2>I think that you would be fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>totally against it.</v>

2206
01:44:10.830 --> 01:44:13.340
<v Speaker 2>I think northern Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those hardheaded motherfuckers,</v>

2207
01:44:13.660 --> 01:44:14.493
<v Speaker 2>you can't tell those motherfuckers yo </v>
<v Speaker 2>friend or whatever the fuck they call </v>

2208
01:44:17.151 --> 01:44:17.721
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2209
01:44:17.721 --> 01:44:21.140
<v Speaker 2>But that's also where the Vatican is </v>
<v Speaker 2>like how ironic is that?</v>

2210
01:44:21.170 --> 01:44:25.450
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't make any sense because that</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the biggest gay sex organization.</v>

2211
01:44:25.470 --> 01:44:27.500
<v Speaker 2>But they don't want to know that they're</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be one sale.</v>

2212
01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:28.810
<v Speaker 2>That pedophilia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2213
01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:30.560
<v Speaker 2>The biggest pedal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wants to know that.</v>

2214
01:44:30.770 --> 01:44:33.230
<v Speaker 2>Do they preach fuck each other or they </v>
<v Speaker 2>only fuck kids?</v>

2215
01:44:33.310 --> 01:44:35.000
<v Speaker 2>How does that work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who knows?</v>

2216
01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:38.660
<v Speaker 2>You've got to bring me down with that </v>
<v Speaker 2>book now and Shit.</v>

2217
01:44:38.680 --> 01:44:42.160
<v Speaker 2>But I'm just curious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

2218
01:44:42.161 --> 01:44:42.994
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2219
01:44:43.220 --> 01:44:44.053
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just know how it was when I was </v>

2220
01:44:46.341 --> 01:44:47.174
<v Speaker 2>growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know the Vatican owned the gay </v>

2221
01:44:48.260 --> 01:44:49.520
<v Speaker 2>bathhouse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2222
01:44:49.730 --> 01:44:53.660
<v Speaker 2>the building the Vatican owns was home </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the biggest gay bathhouse in Italy.</v>

2223
01:44:55.340 --> 01:45:00.340
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should go play some synthetic heroin.</v>

2224
01:45:01.970 --> 01:45:02.571
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me,</v>

2225
01:45:02.571 --> 01:45:04.620
<v Speaker 2>I'll pull up the story because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking ridiculous game.</v>

2226
01:45:04.700 --> 01:45:07.160
<v Speaker 2>Jamie Polish it up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put it up on the big screen.</v>

2227
01:45:07.190 --> 01:45:08.630
<v Speaker 2>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They own their mean.</v>

2228
01:45:08.631 --> 01:45:10.970
<v Speaker 2>There's so blatant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've been doing this for so long,</v>

2229
01:45:11.260 --> 01:45:12.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this,</v>

2230
01:45:12.411 --> 01:45:16.160
<v Speaker 2>this gigantic crazy cult that's running </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Catholic empire.</v>

2231
01:45:16.310 --> 01:45:17.143
<v Speaker 2>They've been in charge for so long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wearing wizard costumes and sitting on </v>

2232
01:45:20.361 --> 01:45:21.194
<v Speaker 2>thrones and people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many people have bought into it that </v>

2233
01:45:25.290 --> 01:45:26.123
<v Speaker 2>look at this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Vatican pays the landlord to </v>

2234
01:45:27.020 --> 01:45:29.660
<v Speaker 2>Europe's biggest gay bath house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by the way I say this,</v>

2235
01:45:30.350 --> 01:45:31.370
<v Speaker 2>I went to Catholic school.</v>

2236
01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:36.760
<v Speaker 2>I'm allowed to say this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Three landlord to.</v>

2237
01:45:38.030 --> 01:45:40.670
<v Speaker 2>They play landlord,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Europe's biggest gay bath house.</v>

2238
01:45:41.060 --> 01:45:41.893
<v Speaker 2>The church paid $30,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>to acquire a building that houses a </v>

2239
01:45:44.601 --> 01:45:49.601
<v Speaker 2>senior cardinal and a huge gay sauna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait a fucking minute.</v>

2240
01:45:50.090 --> 01:45:54.020
<v Speaker 2>They have a senior cardinal and a huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>gay sauna.</v>

2241
01:45:54.021 --> 01:45:56.390
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's his own private gay bath house.</v>

2242
01:45:56.420 --> 01:45:59.000
<v Speaker 2>The guy owns a bathhouse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They paid 30 million.</v>

2243
01:45:59.150 --> 01:45:59.983
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how crazy is it that the Vatican has 30 </v>

2244
01:46:01.710 --> 01:46:04.580
<v Speaker 2>billion bucks to buy houses with like </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have so much money?</v>

2245
01:46:05.180 --> 01:46:06.710
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The 75 year old printer,</v>

2246
01:46:06.711 --> 01:46:07.544
<v Speaker 2>that church enjoys a 12 room apartment </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the first floor of the imposing </v>

2247
01:46:11.871 --> 01:46:12.704
<v Speaker 2>Palazzo at two via cod Duci just yards </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the ground floor entrance to the </v>

2248
01:46:17.701 --> 01:46:19.550
<v Speaker 2>steamy flesh pot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's.</v>

2249
01:46:19.730 --> 01:46:21.680
<v Speaker 2>He's above it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>smelling it.</v>

2250
01:46:22.370 --> 01:46:25.250
<v Speaker 2>There are 18 other Vatican apartments in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the block.</v>

2251
01:46:25.251 --> 01:46:27.410
<v Speaker 2>Many of wind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which house priests,</v>

2252
01:46:27.770 --> 01:46:28.603
<v Speaker 2>Cardinal Ds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is seen as a social conservative </v>

2253
01:46:31.131 --> 01:46:33.410
<v Speaker 2>even by current standards of the church </v>
<v Speaker 2>hierarchy,</v>

2254
01:46:33.411 --> 01:46:37.880
<v Speaker 2>is no doubt horrified to learn of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>activities taking place a floor below.</v>

2255
01:46:38.330 --> 01:46:42.710
<v Speaker 2>My goodness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could not imagine it's apartment.</v>

<v Speaker 2>smells like buttholes mildly.</v>

2257
01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:49.200
<v Speaker 2>It's probably a tornado and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably a black man.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I just get dark fucking thoughts and </v>

2312
01:49:18.061 --> 01:49:18.894
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Boulder,</v>

2314
01:49:21.361 --> 01:49:23.810
<v Speaker 5>I learned that they chant a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And in other words,</v>

2315
01:49:23.811 --> 01:49:26.150
<v Speaker 5>a chant is not any different than a </v>
<v Speaker 5>prayer,</v>

2316
01:49:26.890 --> 01:49:28.950
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>So sometimes I got a bad thought.</v>

2317
01:49:28.951 --> 01:49:30.830
<v Speaker 5>I'll say a fucking Lord's prayer,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>

<v Speaker 5>it just does something to you just like.</v>

2320
01:49:37.410 --> 01:49:39.960
<v Speaker 5>But it's for some people it's like </v>
<v Speaker 5>getting punched in the stomach.</v>

2321
01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:42.790
<v Speaker 5>You trusted somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like having a babysitter.</v>

<v Speaker 5>That Melissa Kitty,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're numb for a week.</v>

01:49:47.980 --> 01:49:48.813
<v Speaker 1>whole fucking society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every three days we get dropped with </v>

2329
01:49:58.620 --> 01:49:59.453

<v Speaker 1>something like that off in someone's </v>

<v Speaker 1>Are they born with that?</v>

2331
01:50:04.780 --> 01:50:06.910
<v Speaker 1>Does it happen because someone does it </v>
<v Speaker 1>to them?</v>

2332
01:50:07.390 --> 01:50:09.460
<v Speaker 1>Does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a chemical imbalance?</v>

2333
01:50:09.461 --> 01:50:13.420
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck is it that makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone sexually attracted to kids?</v>

2334

<v Speaker 1>You're trying to get yourself killed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no better way to get yourself </v>

01:57:38.491 --> 01:57:40.290
<v Speaker 1>It's probably one person that we've just</v>
<v Speaker 1>done now.</v>

2498
01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:42.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like a Mexican superhero or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

2499
01:57:42.690 --> 01:57:43.523
<v Speaker 1>They don't really use rodeo clowns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a mean in bullfighting mean </v>

2500
01:57:47.070 --> 01:57:47.903
<v Speaker 1>this like bull riding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure is an American </v>

2501
01:57:50.791 --> 01:57:52.080
<v Speaker 1>tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it?</v>

2502
01:57:52.230 --> 01:57:53.880
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2503
01:57:53.881 --> 01:57:54.714
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Mexico obviously they have a lot of </v>

2504
01:57:55.750 --> 01:57:57.720
<v Speaker 1>bullfighting in Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spain,</v>

2505
01:57:57.721 --> 01:57:59.880
<v Speaker 1>they have a lot of bull fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess that's where they got it from,</v>

2506
01:57:59.881 --> 01:58:01.890
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They imported from Spain.</v>

2507
01:58:01.950 --> 01:58:05.860
<v Speaker 1>I'm open because that's what Mexican </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico is.</v>

2508
01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:10.880
<v Speaker 1>It's like the indigenous Americans that </v>
<v Speaker 1>came over when the Spanish came over,</v>

2509
01:58:11.510 --> 01:58:13.590
<v Speaker 1>they taught them Spanish and started </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking them.</v>

2510
01:58:14.010 --> 01:58:16.200
<v Speaker 1>And that's a main Mexican.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I get like Mexicans,</v>

2511
01:58:16.201 --> 01:58:18.270
<v Speaker 1>like Oscar de la Hoya,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2512
01:58:18.320 --> 01:58:20.430
<v Speaker 1>who's like this beautiful looking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2513
01:58:20.460 --> 01:58:24.030
<v Speaker 1>European looking man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like kind of fairly pale skin.</v>

2514
01:58:24.390 --> 01:58:26.340
<v Speaker 1>And then you'll get a Mexican,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2515
01:58:26.341 --> 01:58:27.174
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Juan Manwell Marquez was like much more </v>

2516
01:58:29.221 --> 01:58:31.410
<v Speaker 1>Mexican looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inca Inca,</v>

2517
01:58:32.220 --> 01:58:35.110
<v Speaker 1>the darker skin and like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2518
01:58:35.380 --> 01:58:37.350
<v Speaker 1>darker hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting,</v>

2519
01:58:37.351 --> 01:58:38.190
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a,</v>

2520
01:58:38.191 --> 01:58:40.890
<v Speaker 1>the whole North American continent is </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking fascinating.</v>

2521
01:58:41.290 --> 01:58:44.800
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating to think that if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>came to this spot 400 years ago,</v>

2522
01:58:44.801 --> 01:58:46.600
<v Speaker 1>there'd be very few people here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>

2523
01:58:46.601 --> 01:58:47.470
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very few.</v>

2524
01:58:47.530 --> 01:58:50.470
<v Speaker 1>A few nomadic tribes of native </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans.</v>

2525
01:58:50.590 --> 01:58:52.210
<v Speaker 1>No cities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no nothing.</v>

2526
01:58:52.900 --> 01:58:53.530
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think,</v>

2527
01:58:53.530 --> 01:58:57.790
<v Speaker 1>how interesting is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a ds on the boat with Columbus</v>

2528
01:58:57.830 --> 01:59:02.410
<v Speaker 1>under Valdez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really Diaz on the boat with all the has</v>

2529
01:59:02.411 --> 01:59:03.820
<v Speaker 1>come from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say that.</v>

2530
01:59:04.350 --> 01:59:05.183
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say Tetra Dad and they spell it</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a z and then one of the biggest </v>

2531
01:59:11.621 --> 01:59:16.450
<v Speaker 1>lieutenants in Sicilian history is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>as with a seat and then we just saw that</v>

2532
01:59:16.451 --> 01:59:17.080
<v Speaker 1>priests within.</v>

2533
01:59:17.080 --> 01:59:19.390
<v Speaker 1>That's a dance with a C,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Z,</v>

2534
01:59:19.770 --> 01:59:20.680
<v Speaker 1>Z,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Z,</v>

2535
01:59:21.250 --> 01:59:22.083
<v Speaker 1>and then you have the fucking lunatics </v>
<v Speaker 1>up in Stockman and then Mexican and I'm </v>

2536
01:59:27.731 --> 01:59:29.860
<v Speaker 1>sitting here in front of you and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cuba as can be.</v>

2537
01:59:30.460 --> 01:59:31.293
<v Speaker 1>That makes you think like the as the as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the and the as as a lieutenant and Diaz </v>

2538
01:59:36.611 --> 01:59:40.330
<v Speaker 1>was on the ship as an Italian Talon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ds,</v>

2539
01:59:40.390 --> 01:59:43.390
<v Speaker 1>Italian as an Italian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Valdez with Z.</v>

2540
01:59:44.350 --> 01:59:49.350
<v Speaker 1>my mother's side of the family's Valdez </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the darker than that and my father's</v>

2541
01:59:50.321 --> 01:59:53.710
<v Speaker 1>side is diaz from come away and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>came from Spain.</v>

2542
01:59:54.190 --> 01:59:58.340
<v Speaker 1>They speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing that I've either faith,</v>

2543
01:59:58.610 --> 02:00:00.790
<v Speaker 1>they speak like Jaguar was like those </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2544
02:00:01.450 --> 02:00:04.570
<v Speaker 1>So you have to think how to be as get </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mexico.</v>

2545
02:00:05.560 --> 02:00:08.950
<v Speaker 1>How did this diaz get here and how the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Diaz with a z,</v>

2546
02:00:09.340 --> 02:00:10.930
<v Speaker 1>the Diaz would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

2547
02:00:11.290 --> 02:00:13.810
<v Speaker 1>These are all very interesting things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I look at.</v>

2548
02:00:13.990 --> 02:00:14.823
<v Speaker 1>You look at evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We were talking about how they found </v>

2549
02:00:16.601 --> 02:00:19.120
<v Speaker 1>that fucking pull up the whale in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wyoming,</v>

2550
02:00:19.900 --> 02:00:22.600
<v Speaker 1>but years ago we have no discussion on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the podcast.</v>

2551
02:00:22.601 --> 02:00:23.434
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is things that have always baffled </v>

2552
02:00:25.181 --> 02:00:26.014
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how come there's Nate Diaz and his </v>

2553
02:00:27.701 --> 02:00:31.390
<v Speaker 1>brother that Mexicans are not income </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexicans too though,</v>

2554
02:00:31.660 --> 02:00:33.460
<v Speaker 1>right there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other Mexicans.</v>

2555
02:00:33.800 --> 02:00:36.130
<v Speaker 1>It came from somewhere else and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>robbed whatever.</v>

2556
02:00:36.131 --> 02:00:38.350
<v Speaker 1>So it's very interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2557
02:00:38.351 --> 02:00:39.860
<v Speaker 1>what's interesting to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>

2558
02:00:40.100 --> 02:00:40.933
<v Speaker 1>One of the things that's been getting me</v>
<v Speaker 1>lately is this water situation in </v>

2559
02:00:44.050 --> 02:00:45.760
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty bad.</v>

2560
02:00:46.090 --> 02:00:48.550
<v Speaker 1>It's a three years going on four years </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2561
02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:50.890
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drought is pretty ferocious.</v>

2562
02:00:50.920 --> 02:00:52.150
<v Speaker 1>Like they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2563
02:00:52.180 --> 02:00:57.180
<v Speaker 1>they're saying that California was used </v>
<v Speaker 1>29 percent less water last month.</v>

2564
02:00:57.400 --> 02:00:59.200
<v Speaker 1>So people are working to try to solve </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2565
02:00:59.201 --> 02:01:00.034
<v Speaker 1>But what was occurring to me when I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking about this as we know for a </v>

2566
02:01:03.281 --> 02:01:04.114
<v Speaker 1>fact that there's areas of the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>that used to be lush and then they </v>

2567
02:01:07.571 --> 02:01:08.404
<v Speaker 1>became desert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's a that we know for a fact </v>

2568
02:01:10.481 --> 02:01:13.420
<v Speaker 1>about the Nile Valley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in Egypt where the pyramids used to</v>

2569
02:01:13.421 --> 02:01:16.870
<v Speaker 1>be where the where the pyramids are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rather before that 9,000</v>

2570
02:01:16.871 --> 02:01:17.704
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know there was like a rain forest </v>

2571
02:01:18.701 --> 02:01:19.534
<v Speaker 1>there and slowly over time shit just </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed and then there's not that much </v>

2572
02:01:23.321 --> 02:01:25.870
<v Speaker 1>rainfall and that could easily happen to</v>
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>

2573
02:01:26.080 --> 02:01:26.913
<v Speaker 1>But would we stay with everybody stay </v>
<v Speaker 1>here when they just keep pumping water </v>

2574
02:01:29.981 --> 02:01:32.380
<v Speaker 1>artificially into this spot or when </v>
<v Speaker 1>people go,</v>

2575
02:01:32.381 --> 02:01:34.600
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This ain't working the same word.</v>

2576
02:01:34.601 --> 02:01:36.640
<v Speaker 1>We know how many fucking we got to move </v>
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>

2577
02:01:36.700 --> 02:01:39.320
<v Speaker 1>Like we've always had to all throughout </v>
<v Speaker 1>human history.</v>

2578
02:01:39.470 --> 02:01:40.280
<v Speaker 1>Whenever the climate</v>

2579
02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:41.990
<v Speaker 2>got bad people to get the fuck out of </v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2580
02:01:42.110 --> 02:01:45.230
<v Speaker 2>When the ice age was happening here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one was living in Canada.</v>

2581
02:01:45.350 --> 02:01:46.183
<v Speaker 2>No one was living in Canada during the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ice age because it was two miles thick </v>

2582
02:01:49.731 --> 02:01:51.830
<v Speaker 2>of ice and a lot of spots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You wouldn't,</v>

2583
02:01:51.860 --> 02:01:53.510
<v Speaker 2>you weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you weren't living on ice,</v>

2584
02:01:53.860 --> 02:01:54.693
<v Speaker 2>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would find a way to get to a place </v>

2585
02:01:56.391 --> 02:01:57.740
<v Speaker 2>where it's not ice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2586
02:01:57.741 --> 02:01:58.574
<v Speaker 2>but all the places that were covered in </v>
<v Speaker 2>ice where there was a massive amount of </v>

2587
02:02:00.441 --> 02:02:02.990
<v Speaker 2>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so all when all that ice receded,</v>

2588
02:02:02.991 --> 02:02:04.190
<v Speaker 2>that's where we got the Great Lakes </v>
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>

2589
02:02:04.490 --> 02:02:08.330
<v Speaker 2>The Great Lakes are fucking puddles that</v>
<v Speaker 2>are melted glaciers.</v>

2590
02:02:08.450 --> 02:02:09.283
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's how fucking crazy this place was </v>

2591
02:02:10.730 --> 02:02:12.140
<v Speaker 2>just 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

2592
02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:13.273
<v Speaker 2>if we had a house and it was there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't be stubborn when the ice </v>

2593
02:02:16.281 --> 02:02:17.810
<v Speaker 2>starts coming.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't say,</v>

2594
02:02:17.811 --> 02:02:19.070
<v Speaker 2>we're just going to keep chipping away </v>
<v Speaker 2>at that.</v>

2595
02:02:19.160 --> 02:02:20.930
<v Speaker 2>Over a year I get a certain point in </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2596
02:02:20.931 --> 02:02:21.580
<v Speaker 2>You've got to realize,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2597
02:02:21.580 --> 02:02:22.413
<v Speaker 2>there's two miles of ice and it's as big</v>
<v Speaker 2>as fucking Canada or half a Canada or </v>

2598
02:02:27.230 --> 02:02:29.720
<v Speaker 2>even a few states where those few states</v>
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>

2599
02:02:29.750 --> 02:02:32.060
<v Speaker 2>you can't live.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta get Outta there.</v>

2600
02:02:32.180 --> 02:02:35.210
<v Speaker 2>You gotta get out of there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if that happens here,</v>

2601
02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:36.433
<v Speaker 2>we're so arrogant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our idea that we can control nature is </v>

2602
02:02:38.720 --> 02:02:42.140
<v Speaker 2>so arrogant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one considers leaving California like</v>

2603
02:02:42.141 --> 02:02:43.550
<v Speaker 2>everybody talks about like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2604
02:02:43.551 --> 02:02:44.384
<v Speaker 2>California is California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We got to do something about the </v>

2605
02:02:45.501 --> 02:02:49.100
<v Speaker 2>California water crisis with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It never rains again because guess what?</v>

2606
02:02:49.160 --> 02:02:49.993
<v Speaker 2>That could happen if it doesn't rain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but once or twice a year or 10 times a </v>

2607
02:02:53.481 --> 02:02:54.314
<v Speaker 2>year or 20 times a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there have been way crazier things than </v>

2608
02:02:58.281 --> 02:03:01.820
<v Speaker 2>a shift in our climate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To the point where it rains zero,</v>

2609
02:03:02.060 --> 02:03:04.640
<v Speaker 2>that's totally possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's totally possible.</v>

2610
02:03:04.760 --> 02:03:07.640
<v Speaker 2>If it's possible to rain one day a year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's possible to rein zero.</v>

2611
02:03:08.030 --> 02:03:10.130
<v Speaker 2>If it's possible to rein 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's possible to rain one,</v>

2612
02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:12.140
<v Speaker 2>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can be horrific,</v>

2613
02:03:12.620 --> 02:03:13.453
<v Speaker 2>disastrous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's totally possible and it would be </v>

2614
02:03:15.561 --> 02:03:16.394
<v Speaker 2>normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It would be something that's happened </v>

2615
02:03:17.511 --> 02:03:18.344
<v Speaker 2>all throughout the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know that like a lot of deserts </v>

2616
02:03:20.751 --> 02:03:23.840
<v Speaker 2>used to be like lush areas and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>somehow or another,</v>

2617
02:03:23.870 --> 02:03:28.360
<v Speaker 2>like for whatever reason things changed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things shifted.</v>

2618
02:03:28.630 --> 02:03:30.410
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you can blame people you want.</v>

2619
02:03:30.411 --> 02:03:35.411
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure we have a lot to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure global warming that there's,</v>

2620
02:03:36.290 --> 02:03:40.820
<v Speaker 2>without a doubt as some element of human</v>
<v Speaker 2>civilization is a part of it is too many</v>

2621
02:03:40.821 --> 02:03:44.210
<v Speaker 2>scientists that believe it does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's gotta be some factor,</v>

2622
02:03:44.420 --> 02:03:47.480
<v Speaker 2>but even without that factor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's super possible.</v>

2623
02:03:47.481 --> 02:03:49.300
<v Speaker 2>That shit would change on its own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2624
02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:50.420
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it shifts.</v>

2625
02:03:50.450 --> 02:03:53.280
<v Speaker 2>We don't control when it rains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could fuckin shift.</v>

2626
02:03:53.290 --> 02:03:56.660
<v Speaker 2>It easily could shift and if you're in a</v>
<v Speaker 2>spot that sucks,</v>

2627
02:03:56.840 --> 02:03:57.673

<v Speaker 2>your body into something that's more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more womanly or more,</v>

2850
02:13:36.140 --> 02:13:36.973

<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason that activates that </v>

2851
02:13:38.521 --> 02:13:40.860
<v Speaker 2>part of your lizard brain that sees the </v>
<v Speaker 2>big,</v>

2852
02:13:40.861 --> 02:13:41.694
<v Speaker 2>fleshy tits and thinks that this,</v>

<v Speaker 2>That's the same gene that gives you the </v>

2856
02:13:48.601 --> 02:13:49.434
<v Speaker 2>big ass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the big ass and big tits like that </v>

2857
02:13:51.241 --> 02:13:52.074
<v Speaker 2>sparks the is like a flame.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not as a matter of someone giving </v>

2858
02:13:54.601 --> 02:13:55.434
<v Speaker 2>you affection.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a matter of someone giving you </v>

2859
02:13:56.731 --> 02:14:00.810
<v Speaker 2>affection in a very specific shape that </v>
<v Speaker 2>that rings in your brain.</v>

2860
02:14:01.050 --> 02:14:01.883
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can do that and do that absolutely </v>

2861
02:14:03.811 --> 02:14:06.120
<v Speaker 2>perfectly and they will be able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually,</v>

2862
02:14:06.121 --> 02:14:06.954
<v Speaker 2>if they can already right now and turn a</v>
<v Speaker 2>guy into the exact shape of a woman </v>

2863
02:14:11.461 --> 02:14:14.070
<v Speaker 2>that's hot as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the end of the day,</v>

2864
02:14:14.820 --> 02:14:18.450
<v Speaker 2>you can search around for some fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>hidden cracker Jack Toy.</v>

2865
02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:21.510
<v Speaker 2>It can lift her up and look around and </v>
<v Speaker 2>try to figure out,</v>

2866
02:14:21.511 --> 02:14:24.390
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I guess is this a woman?</v>

2867
02:14:24.510 --> 02:14:27.930
<v Speaker 2>I just looks exactly like a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It feels like a woman.</v>

2868
02:14:27.960 --> 02:14:28.793
<v Speaker 2>It talks like a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>goddammit is as a woman and you'll </v>

2869
02:14:32.161 --> 02:14:32.994
<v Speaker 2>eventually decide that it's a woman </v>
<v Speaker 2>because your brain processes that as </v>

2870
02:14:36.721 --> 02:14:37.554
<v Speaker 2>female,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your brain processes the words is </v>

2871
02:14:39.271 --> 02:14:42.450
<v Speaker 2>female,</v>

2872
02:14:42.451 --> 02:14:46.350
<v Speaker 2>figure out how to do it just perfectly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just perfectly genetically,</v>

2873
02:14:46.410 --> 02:14:48.630
<v Speaker 2>they figured out how to go in there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking tweak this shit.</v>

2874
02:14:49.500 --> 02:14:51.180
<v Speaker 2>They're close to doing crazy shit like </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

2875
02:14:51.420 --> 02:14:52.253
<v Speaker 2>You saw that thing that I'm Rhonda.</v>

02:14:58.260 --> 02:14:59.093
<v Speaker 2>They're doing a pig's man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They figured out a way to delete a gene </v>

2878
02:15:01.261 --> 02:15:03.540
<v Speaker 2>and pigs and they come like incredible </v>
<v Speaker 2>hulk pigs.</v>

2881
02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:07.553
<v Speaker 2>They're doing all kinds of weird shit </v>
<v Speaker 2>with genetics and they're already doing </v>

2882
02:15:10.171 --> 02:15:12.780
<v Speaker 2>this on people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She says in China,</v>

02:15:28.741 --> 02:15:32.790
<v Speaker 2>Like this is a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a new thing they're doing to the</v>

2890
02:15:32.791 --> 02:15:33.624
<v Speaker 2>bodies of these animals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're gonna be able to do that to </v>

2891
02:15:35.191 --> 02:15:36.840
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to a man and they're gonna.</v>

2892
02:15:36.841 --> 02:15:39.360
<v Speaker 2>Be able to turn a man into a woman like </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly.</v>

<v Speaker 2>if she really looked like that.</v>

2996
02:20:18.500 --> 02:20:19.333
<v Speaker 2>So this is the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're looking at something like </v>

2997
02:20:20.631 --> 02:20:21.464
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has been through more fucking </v>

2998
02:20:22.791 --> 02:20:23.624
<v Speaker 2>computers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean more screens and filters and we </v>

2999
02:20:27.171 --> 02:20:28.004
<v Speaker 2>all know that we all know about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference between what someone would </v>

3000
02:20:30.681 --> 02:20:31.514
<v Speaker 2>look like in real life and so on look </v>

<v Speaker 2>It's a big difference,</v>

3002
02:20:37.400 --> 02:20:41.390
<v Speaker 2>but a man good for her if that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>she wants to do now.</v>

3003
02:20:41.420 --> 02:20:43.700
<v Speaker 2>Same thing we were talking about before </v>
<v Speaker 2>about gay marriage.</v>

3004
02:20:44.030 --> 02:20:46.220
<v Speaker 2>Good for her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If this is what she enjoys,</v>

3005
02:20:46.670 --> 02:20:47.503
<v Speaker 2>I'm glad that she can be on the cover of</v>
<v Speaker 2>magazine and it could be a fun time for </v>

3006
02:20:50.991 --> 02:20:52.280
<v Speaker 2>everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3007
02:20:54.540 --> 02:20:56.490

<v Speaker 2>this could have never happened.</v>

3008
02:20:57.080 --> 02:20:58.560
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never.</v>

3009
02:21:00.380 --> 02:21:01.440

<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3010
02:21:01.580 --> 02:21:05.870
<v Speaker 3>And it did happen when we were kids that</v>

<v Speaker 3>just didn't know about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It happened like in Germany or </v>

<v Speaker 3>She had the nails and she would get </v>

3039
02:22:27.001 --> 02:22:31.500
<v Speaker 3>Nachos and then she'd go to get a drink </v>
<v Speaker 3>and we'd take her Nachos and she'd yell.</v>

3040
02:22:31.740 --> 02:22:33.870
<v Speaker 3>She had a very feminine voice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like yes darling.</v>

3041

3042
02:22:42.280 --> 02:22:46.110
<v Speaker 3>money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The government or the doctors gave her a</v>

3043
02:22:46.111 --> 02:22:46.944
<v Speaker 3>certain amount of a month and she became</v>
<v Speaker 3>a pill addict because the pain from the </v>

3044
02:22:50.671 --> 02:22:53.820
<v Speaker 3>surgery plus all the psychological and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everything.</v>

3047
02:22:56.850 --> 02:22:59.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I met Rita in [inaudible] 95 read.</v>

3048
02:22:59.280 --> 02:23:01.680
<v Speaker 3>It was 50 already,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying?</v>

3049

<v Speaker 3>maybe 30.</v>

3050
02:23:04.710 --> 02:23:06.750
<v Speaker 3>So she was telling me that when she was </v>
<v Speaker 3>growing up,</v>

3051
02:23:06.751 --> 02:23:10.590
<v Speaker 3>my mother and father would beat her when</v>
<v Speaker 3>she would tell him that she was really a</v>

3052
02:23:10.591 --> 02:23:12.340

<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

3054
02:23:15.210 --> 02:23:18.150
<v Speaker 3>And then once she finally became a </v>
<v Speaker 3>woman,</v>

3055
02:23:19.220 --> 02:23:21.690
<v Speaker 3>there was so much baggage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3058
02:23:29.010 --> 02:23:29.843

<v Speaker 3>times a week still.</v>

<v Speaker 3>about with the big issue?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was that transition,</v>

3062
02:23:37.951 --> 02:23:40.020
<v Speaker 3>was it a transition transition?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

02:23:40.021 --> 02:23:43.020
<v Speaker 3>but she ate a lot of bells.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She did a lot of powder.</v>

3064
02:23:43.440 --> 02:23:44.273
<v Speaker 3>She had tons of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know where she got the money </v>

3065
02:23:46.891 --> 02:23:49.230
<v Speaker 3>from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know she sold drugs.</v>

3066
02:23:49.290 --> 02:23:50.123
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she even came down here to see me once </v>

3067
02:23:51.841 --> 02:23:54.330
<v Speaker 3>when I was at the comedy store,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like in [inaudible] 99.</v>

3068
02:23:55.170 --> 02:23:56.003
<v Speaker 3>And she died shortly after that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She fell off the stage and went into a </v>

3069
02:23:58.571 --> 02:24:01.080
<v Speaker 3>coma and died.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And we're joking around.</v>

3070
02:24:01.081 --> 02:24:02.640
<v Speaker 3>And it was true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her head was too big.</v>

3071
02:24:02.700 --> 02:24:03.533
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot to do with their pills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's taking pills is more likely I'd </v>

3072
02:24:09.900 --> 02:24:13.040
<v Speaker 3>been in contact in my life that maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3073
02:24:13.590 --> 02:24:15.450
<v Speaker 3>maybe two or three transgenders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

3074
02:24:15.690 --> 02:24:16.523
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like on the streets when I was a kid in </v>

3075
02:24:18.121 --> 02:24:23.121
<v Speaker 3>New York City or something and something</v>
<v Speaker 3>was always missing,</v>

3076
02:24:24.170 --> 02:24:24.780
<v Speaker 3>you know what I'm saying?</v>

3077
02:24:24.780 --> 02:24:27.620
<v Speaker 3>Even after they did the surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something's always not right.</v>

3078
02:24:27.621 --> 02:24:29.820
<v Speaker 3>You're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they just did something major,</v>

3079
02:24:29.821 --> 02:24:32.310
<v Speaker 3>Major.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a major step.</v>

3080
02:24:32.580 --> 02:24:33.413
<v Speaker 3>We're just strolling it around with </v>
<v Speaker 3>these fucking idiots and they're going </v>

3081
02:24:35.451 --> 02:24:37.140
<v Speaker 3>to start throwing it around like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>tattoo.</v>

3082
02:24:37.410 --> 02:24:39.780
<v Speaker 3>That's the part of it that I don't like </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

3083
02:24:39.781 --> 02:24:40.614
<v Speaker 3>Now every time somebody feels feminine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're gonna want to have this fucking </v>

3084
02:24:43.771 --> 02:24:45.660
<v Speaker 3>surgery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>

3085
02:24:45.661 --> 02:24:47.820
<v Speaker 3>Like one day you feel confused or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

3086
02:24:48.010 --> 02:24:51.240
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the part of it I don't like.</v>

3087
02:24:51.270 --> 02:24:53.520
<v Speaker 3>I get all this gender stuff and I get </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3088
02:24:53.550 --> 02:24:54.720
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're a woman,</v>

3089
02:24:54.721 --> 02:24:55.554
<v Speaker 3>that you were born feeling this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in today's society we got too many </v>

3090
02:24:58.381 --> 02:25:00.930
<v Speaker 3>sheep that too many weeks olds out there</v>
<v Speaker 3>though,</v>

3091
02:25:02.190 --> 02:25:03.860
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it still argue about,</v>

3092
02:25:04.390 --> 02:25:05.700
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not good.</v>

3093
02:25:05.910 --> 02:25:09.150
<v Speaker 3>And those are the people I worry about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those people that,</v>

3094
02:25:09.151 --> 02:25:09.984
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you ever go somewhere and you hear </v>

3095
02:25:10.921 --> 02:25:11.754
<v Speaker 3>people talking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know who's there just to try to be </v>

3096
02:25:14.251 --> 02:25:15.084
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3097
02:25:15.600 --> 02:25:18.480
<v Speaker 3>I'll never forget this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went through a a restaurant or it's to</v>

3098
02:25:18.481 --> 02:25:21.120
<v Speaker 3>Santa Monica and there was a guy behind </v>
<v Speaker 3>me and I'm always eating.</v>

3099
02:25:21.570 --> 02:25:22.980
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody's this gay.</v>

3100
02:25:25.450 --> 02:25:28.540
<v Speaker 3>Nobody could be this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy was not born like this.</v>

3101
02:25:28.990 --> 02:25:31.420
<v Speaker 3>This one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy is something that he does to be</v>

3102
02:25:31.421 --> 02:25:32.254
<v Speaker 3>accepted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't even know what he's doing in </v>

3103
02:25:33.491 --> 02:25:34.324
<v Speaker 3>six years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He won't be gained no more than six </v>

3104
02:25:35.831 --> 02:25:36.664
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't have a wife and a kid living </v>

3105
02:25:37.241 --> 02:25:40.740
<v Speaker 3>in Idaho to be a farmer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's just doing this to fit in this.</v>

3106
02:25:40.741 --> 02:25:41.574
<v Speaker 3>Just like I have a lot of that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel a lot of that with people today </v>

3107
02:25:44.891 --> 02:25:49.480
<v Speaker 3>in our society a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel people are not completely in.</v>

3108
02:25:49.680 --> 02:25:51.850
<v Speaker 3>There's some people where there's not </v>
<v Speaker 3>people in,</v>

3109
02:25:51.851 --> 02:25:52.684
<v Speaker 3>they're not there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why I tell people before you </v>

3110
02:25:54.671 --> 02:25:55.504
<v Speaker 3>go in there fucking think it over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's hanging out with devil </v>

3111
02:25:58.241 --> 02:25:59.074
<v Speaker 3>worshipers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hanging out with drug dealers or </v>

3112
02:26:01.250 --> 02:26:03.700
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck you want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because once you're in,</v>

3113
02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:04.833
<v Speaker 3>you're in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to end up kidnapping </v>

3114
02:26:05.471 --> 02:26:06.490
<v Speaker 3>somebody with a machine gun.</v>

3115
02:26:06.730 --> 02:26:09.070
<v Speaker 3>Don't tell me what the fuck I know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

3116
02:26:09.071 --> 02:26:12.230
<v Speaker 3>When somebody is faking the funk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's people that one.</v>

3117
02:26:12.270 --> 02:26:13.710
<v Speaker 3>When I was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jimmy [inaudible],</v>

3118
02:26:13.770 --> 02:26:16.660
<v Speaker 3>who was my brother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew he was gay.</v>

3119
02:26:16.690 --> 02:26:17.523
<v Speaker 3>I knew he was slinging dick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no fucking genius to tell you that </v>

3120
02:26:20.531 --> 02:26:22.570
<v Speaker 3>my brother,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I grew up in his house,</v>

3121
02:26:22.571 --> 02:26:25.300
<v Speaker 3>but his other three brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't tell he was gay.</v>

3122
02:26:25.540 --> 02:26:28.120
<v Speaker 3>If he came to me today and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a transgender,</v>

3123
02:26:28.390 --> 02:26:30.300
<v Speaker 3>I would hug him and go dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's great.</v>

3124
02:26:30.490 --> 02:26:34.390
<v Speaker 3>I can tell you what Dick suck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have no doubts in my heart that</v>

3125
02:26:34.391 --> 02:26:35.224
<v Speaker 3>you weren't going to suck Dick even </v>
<v Speaker 3>though you were fucking girls in the </v>

3126
02:26:36.911 --> 02:26:38.980
<v Speaker 3>neighborhood because you were so good </v>
<v Speaker 3>looking.</v>

3127
02:26:39.550 --> 02:26:41.500
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You grew up with people that you look at</v>

<v Speaker 3>By the way,</v>

3417
02:39:27.130 --> 02:39:31.950
<v Speaker 8>I know exactly what I'm doing tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm setting my alarm clock and I'm going</v>

3418

<v Speaker 8>to be a part of this.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I usually watch you right when I'm going</v>

3419
02:39:34.261 --> 02:39:39.261
<v Speaker 8>to bed really early sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Sometimes you know what I'm going to do,</v>

3420
02:39:39.781 --> 02:39:41.730
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I want to get one of those iphone things</v>

3421
02:39:41.731 --> 02:39:44.760
<v Speaker 8>for the car.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know you got one that illegal.</v>

3422
02:39:47.190 --> 02:39:48.023
<v Speaker 8>It's illegal to do it on the have a </v>
<v Speaker 8>windshield mountain in California </v>

3423
02:39:50.880 --> 02:39:51.713
<v Speaker 8>windshield windshield because it's in </v>
<v Speaker 8>front of you or anything on your </v>

3424
02:39:53.941 --> 02:39:55.710
<v Speaker 8>windshield.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So you can do that on the windshield.</v>

3425
02:39:56.350 --> 02:39:58.560
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you could do it like on the fence.</v>

3426
02:39:58.590 --> 02:40:00.130
<v Speaker 8>They have the ones that snap and events </v>
<v Speaker 8>and.</v>

3427
02:40:00.590 --> 02:40:01.423
<v Speaker 8>But it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's not illegal at periscope while </v>

3428
02:40:02.341 --> 02:40:03.330
<v Speaker 8>you're driving.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think it is.</v>

3429
02:40:03.450 --> 02:40:05.220
<v Speaker 8>I definitely think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Really.</v>

3430
02:40:05.280 --> 02:40:06.113
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Because you're kind of not paying </v>

3431
02:40:06.931 --> 02:40:07.764
<v Speaker 8>attention to the road you are.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If you just turn it on while you're </v>

3432
02:40:09.280 --> 02:40:10.920
<v Speaker 8>driving.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If you're parked,</v>

3433
02:40:10.950 --> 02:40:12.240
<v Speaker 8>he turned it on and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>

3434
02:40:12.241 --> 02:40:13.070
<v Speaker 8>it's on.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Here we go.</v>

3435
02:40:13.070 --> 02:40:13.980
<v Speaker 8>We're going to work.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think</v>

3436
02:40:13.980 --> 02:40:15.460
<v Speaker 1>that's the biggest step you can take.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

3437
02:40:15.660 --> 02:40:18.360
<v Speaker 1>You can drive like that with Gopros </v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's how those shows get made.</v>

3438
02:40:18.770 --> 02:40:21.360
<v Speaker 1>Like drive that drive channel on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube.</v>

3439
02:40:21.420 --> 02:40:23.760
<v Speaker 1>I was with those guys that Matt Farah </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

3440
02:40:23.761 --> 02:40:25.310

<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

3441
02:40:25.320 --> 02:40:26.340
<v Speaker 1>So you could definitely do that.</v>

3442
02:40:26.480 --> 02:40:27.330
<v Speaker 8>I uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>

3443
02:40:27.400 --> 02:40:30.410
<v Speaker 8>I drive all the time but I delete them </v>
<v Speaker 8>right after that.</v>

3444

<v Speaker 1>Cloud is shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fucking forest fire fighting 30 </v>

<v Speaker 1>Sixteen ounces of blood of your blood.</v>

3519
02:43:50.291 --> 02:43:52.880
<v Speaker 1>They've got to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've been doing and I try.</v>

3520
02:43:53.410 --> 02:43:54.243
<v Speaker 1>I try to give blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once a month I go to a doctor with some </v>

3521
02:43:57.581 --> 02:43:59.800
<v Speaker 1>fake fucking excuse because people.</v>

3522
02:43:59.800 --> 02:44:02.470
<v Speaker 1>That's why women don't get heart attacks</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they bleed once a month.</v>

3523
02:44:02.760 --> 02:44:04.180
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

3524
02:44:05.370 --> 02:44:06.203
<v Speaker 1>They change up their fucking blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why women don't get audited </v>

3525
02:44:11.430 --> 02:44:12.263
<v Speaker 1>because every fucking blood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't bleed like women go get </v>

3526
02:44:17.950 --> 02:44:18.783
<v Speaker 1>blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So your body rejuvenates new fucking </v>

3527
02:44:20.560 --> 02:44:21.990
<v Speaker 1>blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if it's for fucking announces.</v>

3528
02:44:22.000 --> 02:44:23.680
<v Speaker 1>What do you think it dealing with?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that was true.</v>

3529
02:44:23.681 --> 02:44:24.431
<v Speaker 1>Then dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did.</v>

3530
02:44:24.431 --> 02:44:27.130
<v Speaker 1>Coke would bleed more than noses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they would probably live longer.</v>

3531
02:44:27.520 --> 02:44:28.353
<v Speaker 1>You talked on them about telling you </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now that the reason women don't </v>

3532
02:44:31.091 --> 02:44:31.924
<v Speaker 1>die as many audit taxes matters because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't believe that the fucking </v>

3533
02:44:34.310 --> 02:44:35.143
<v Speaker 1>monkey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason why they probably don't die </v>

3534
02:44:36.581 --> 02:44:38.050
<v Speaker 1>as much because they don't date as many </v>
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>

3535
02:44:38.120 --> 02:44:40.160
<v Speaker 1>If you're over 40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go give blood once a month.</v>

3536
02:44:40.161 --> 02:44:42.370
<v Speaker 1>Just a couple tubes so your body starts </v>

<v Speaker 1>Brian Campbell's a king.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a king there.</v>

3560

<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

3561
02:45:49.240 --> 02:45:53.620
<v Speaker 1>they don't have the punchline anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they did a punchline comedy night at</v>

3562
02:45:53.621 --> 02:45:57.220
<v Speaker 1>a fucking backyard the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had some gated community.</v>

3563
02:45:57.221 --> 02:46:00.190
<v Speaker 1>They have some crazy community and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>

3564
02:46:00.220 --> 02:46:01.053
<v Speaker 1>somewhere outside of Atlanta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of those engineered </v>

3565
02:46:02.651 --> 02:46:06.010
<v Speaker 1>communities and they have all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>recreations and gated community,</v>

3566
02:46:06.160 --> 02:46:06.993
<v Speaker 1>but they have this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the punchline had a punchline comedy </v>

3567
02:46:09.471 --> 02:46:10.304
<v Speaker 1>night and all these people are sitting </v>
<v Speaker 1>outside and they decided to have a </v>

3568
02:46:12.381 --> 02:46:13.560
<v Speaker 1>comedy night at their,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3571
02:46:15.830 --> 02:46:19.100
<v Speaker 1>What they did to the building?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they lost their lease,</v>

3572
02:46:19.580 --> 02:46:20.413
<v Speaker 1>I'm assuming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they've been there for ever forever </v>

3573
02:46:23.300 --> 02:46:26.150
<v Speaker 1>or they might've decided it doesn't make</v>
<v Speaker 1>sense to keep the lease.</v>

3574
02:46:26.151 --> 02:46:29.540
<v Speaker 1>I don't know exactly what happened and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're looking for another spot.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I was not going to let that happen.</v>

3642

<v Speaker 5>my wife to find me on the floor </v>

3644
02:49:29.040 --> 02:49:31.110

<v Speaker 5>Red Band could never handle red band </v>
<v Speaker 5>will never be the same again.</v>

3646
02:49:33.931 --> 02:49:36.090
<v Speaker 5>If he found me on the floor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>never read,</v>

02:49:36.091 --> 02:49:39.980
<v Speaker 5>Bam would fucking God because he doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 5>have that DNA.</v>

<v Speaker 5>This poor guy you do you to find anybody</v>
<v Speaker 5>on the floor.</v>

3649
02:49:43.170 --> 02:49:46.740
<v Speaker 5>It'd be tough for you to deal with the </v>
<v Speaker 5>league about that.</v>

3650
02:49:46.810 --> 02:49:48.810
<v Speaker 5>It'd be tough for you to deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You are strong.</v>

3651
02:49:48.811 --> 02:49:49.644
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You would put it in perspective a lot </v>

3652
02:49:51.331 --> 02:49:52.270
<v Speaker 5>quicker.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Little Red Bag.</v>

3653
02:49:52.310 --> 02:49:54.900
<v Speaker 5>Could red band would take two years </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about.</v>

3654
02:49:54.940 --> 02:49:55.980
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's not right there.</v>

3655
02:49:57.250 --> 02:50:01.230
<v Speaker 5>Not saying something bad about red band </v>
<v Speaker 5>with bands.</v>

3656
02:50:01.231 --> 02:50:03.930
<v Speaker 5>Got a great soul.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I first met red band,</v>

3657
02:50:03.931 --> 02:50:05.700
<v Speaker 5>I would talk to this kid would leave the</v>
<v Speaker 5>room.</v>

3658
02:50:05.730 --> 02:50:07.940
<v Speaker 5>They didn't know what to make of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Columbus days.</v>

3659
02:50:08.150 --> 02:50:09.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I first.</v>

3660
02:50:09.310 --> 02:50:10.143
<v Speaker 5>He didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So what I'm saying is that some people </v>

3661
02:50:12.330 --> 02:50:13.163
<v Speaker 5>could find a guy on the floor and live </v>
<v Speaker 5>with it and there's some people who </v>

3662
02:50:15.960 --> 02:50:17.890
<v Speaker 5>can't digest it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They can't.</v>

3663
02:50:18.240 --> 02:50:21.120
<v Speaker 5>I didn't want to things I didn't want to</v>
<v Speaker 5>terrify me on the floor.</v>

3664
02:50:21.360 --> 02:50:24.000
<v Speaker 5>I definitely don't want to die in a </v>
<v Speaker 5>hotel room on the fucking road.</v>

3665
02:50:24.930 --> 02:50:25.763
<v Speaker 5>And that was my main playground.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I'm gonna go get a hotel </v>

3666
02:50:28.981 --> 02:50:32.940
<v Speaker 5>room.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Naked juice on your leg hopefully.</v>

3667
02:50:33.020 --> 02:50:36.150
<v Speaker 5>And some chick who left at three in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>morning and then people going to say,</v>

3668
02:50:36.151 --> 02:50:36.984
<v Speaker 5>I told you Joe Rogan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was never going to happen in my </v>

3669
02:50:38.881 --> 02:50:40.800
<v Speaker 5>lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In my lifetime.</v>

3670
02:50:40.801 --> 02:50:43.170

<v Speaker 5>I was not going to hold me from cope.</v>

3671
02:50:43.470 --> 02:50:46.650
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't give them the satisfaction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Even after the fucking fact.</v>

3672
02:50:46.650 --> 02:50:50.910
<v Speaker 5>That's how deep my revenge genome runs.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's hilarious.</v>

3673
02:50:50.911 --> 02:50:51.810

<v Speaker 1>That's the way you described it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like you just became a blank </v>

3719
02:52:26.920 --> 02:52:28.300
<v Speaker 1>shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't happy.</v>

3720

<v Speaker 1>I wasn't sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't mad.</v>

3721
02:52:30.131 --> 02:52:32.180
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't any of the above.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had no emotions.</v>

3722
02:52:33.040 --> 02:52:36.760
<v Speaker 1>You fake the funk in away in those days.</v>

<v Speaker 1>caught me after two days if I sat down </v>

3725
02:52:42.371 --> 02:52:44.920
<v Speaker 1>with a notebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it wasn't until you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3728

<v Speaker 1>you catching it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3732
02:52:53.980 --> 02:52:57.190
<v Speaker 1>we worked together rascals,</v>

3736
02:53:07.990 --> 02:53:11.110
<v Speaker 1>There was a transition where you went </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Joey Diaz,</v>

3737

<v Speaker 1>I watched it happen and it happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>really quickly.</v>

02:53:17.170 --> 02:53:18.760
<v Speaker 1>That was what was weird.</v>

<v Speaker 1>you went down hard and you would go to </v>

3744
02:53:24.421 --> 02:53:25.254
<v Speaker 1>that sometimes you had bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like multiple sets in a row and just </v>

3745
02:53:27.521 --> 02:53:30.400
<v Speaker 1>wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't clicking click and then boom,</v>

3746
02:53:30.760 --> 02:53:31.593
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hit on it and figured out what a </v>

3747
02:53:33.101 --> 02:53:34.390
<v Speaker 1>fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what it was.</v>

3748
02:53:34.930 --> 02:53:35.763
<v Speaker 1>And it almost like you released </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like you had like a demon </v>

3749
02:53:39.311 --> 02:53:39.780
<v Speaker 1>inside it.</v>

3750
02:53:39.780 --> 02:53:41.530
<v Speaker 1>You pulled it out and you've released </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3751
02:53:41.720 --> 02:53:43.090
<v Speaker 1>And then all the sudden you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>crushing.</v>

3752
02:53:43.510 --> 02:53:44.940
<v Speaker 1>I remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was tripling.</v>

3753
02:53:44.950 --> 02:53:47.350
<v Speaker 1>And I were in the back by the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3754
02:53:47.351 --> 02:53:48.184
<v Speaker 1>the back hallway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was like one of the Times where </v>

3755
02:53:49.721 --> 02:53:52.270
<v Speaker 1>you just really started crushing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Tripoli was like,</v>

3756
02:53:52.271 --> 02:53:54.700
<v Speaker 1>Joey Diaz is on another level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

3757
02:53:54.701 --> 02:53:56.680
<v Speaker 1>yeah man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what the fuck?</v>

3758
02:53:56.980 --> 02:53:57.813
<v Speaker 1>Like you just caught it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you caught a wave and all of a sudden </v>

3759
02:54:00.521 --> 02:54:03.760
<v Speaker 1>you were surfing and then from then on </v>
<v Speaker 1>you figured it out.</v>

3760
02:54:03.761 --> 02:54:04.594
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you went from being like a really </v>

3761
02:54:07.391 --> 02:54:11.140
<v Speaker 1>funny guy offstage and an occasionally </v>
<v Speaker 1>funny guy on stage,</v>

3762
02:54:11.141 --> 02:54:16.060
<v Speaker 1>but often mediocre to a monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just monster.</v>

3763
02:54:16.061 --> 02:54:16.894
<v Speaker 1>Like there was nights and the or will </v>
<v Speaker 1>you destroy and we were falling out of </v>

3764
02:54:19.931 --> 02:54:23.500
<v Speaker 1>the back stick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would leave like laughing so hard.</v>

3765
02:54:23.501 --> 02:54:24.334
<v Speaker 1>We would go down the backstairs out into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hallway and it'd be like two or </v>

3766
02:54:26.861 --> 02:54:28.660
<v Speaker 1>three guys slapping their legs.</v>

3767

02:54:30.100 --> 02:54:30.933

<v Speaker 1>Listening to original room brings </v>

3769
02:54:33.701 --> 02:54:35.350
<v Speaker 1>something out of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're out of time.</v>

3770
