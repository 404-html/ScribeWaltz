<v Speaker 1>The joe rogan experience.</v>

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.240
<v Speaker 1>So I love it when your song was released and then it was destroying the charts</v>

3
00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:08.940
<v Speaker 1>for Tlc and then you've gay TRL,</v>

4
00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:09.774
<v Speaker 1>TRL,</v>

5
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:10.560
<v Speaker 1>and then did you,</v>

6
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.450
<v Speaker 1>were you forced to get rid of us?</v>

7
00:00:12.451 --> 00:00:14.160
<v Speaker 1>I was forced to for 98 degrees.</v>

8
00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:14.994
<v Speaker 1>That whole thing was,</v>

9
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.900
<v Speaker 1>it's a very,</v>

10
00:00:15.901 --> 00:00:16.734
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

11
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:18.630
<v Speaker 1>it's a very,</v>

12
00:00:18.631 --> 00:00:19.464
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

13
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:20.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

14
00:00:20.401 --> 00:00:20.641
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:21.001
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

16
00:00:21.001 --> 00:00:21.331
<v Speaker 1>there's a,</v>

17
00:00:21.331 --> 00:00:24.090
<v Speaker 1>there's a little bit of a intrigue here.</v>

18
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

19
00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.460
<v Speaker 1>The went behind the story because there was,</v>

20
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.511
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

21
00:00:27.511 --> 00:00:28.344
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

22
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.450
<v Speaker 1>some things done TRL that we're,</v>

23
00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:32.190
<v Speaker 1>we're not necessarily ever made public.</v>

24
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.970
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

25
00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:33.360
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

26
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.600
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

27
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.070
<v Speaker 1>we'll fill me on the full detail.</v>

28
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.761
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

29
00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:36.181
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

30
00:00:36.181 --> 00:00:37.320
<v Speaker 1>Like the l story,</v>

31
00:00:37.321 --> 00:00:39.660
<v Speaker 1>the L and TRL isn't necessarily,</v>

32
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.460
<v Speaker 1>it's not necessarily live all the time.</v>

33
00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.840
<v Speaker 1>What was your thought on any more?</v>

34
00:00:42.841 --> 00:00:42.961
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

35
00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:43.681
<v Speaker 1>because it was the song,</v>

36
00:00:43.681 --> 00:00:44.670
<v Speaker 1>what was the song and what happened?</v>

37
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.971
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

38
00:00:44.971 --> 00:00:48.780
<v Speaker 1>So we went to Seattle and we were filming bits in Seattle and we thought,</v>

39
00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:48.901
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

40
00:00:48.901 --> 00:00:51.720
<v Speaker 1>this would be funny to do this song called the bump bump song and my favorite</v>

41
00:00:51.721 --> 00:00:51.991
<v Speaker 1>songs,</v>

42
00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:52.950
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous idea.</v>

43
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:53.431
<v Speaker 1>And I would go,</v>

44
00:00:53.431 --> 00:00:56.550
<v Speaker 1>and it was just a silly video of me going around from a Seattle saying,</v>

45
00:00:56.551 --> 00:00:57.600
<v Speaker 1>my bum is on the cheese,</v>

46
00:00:57.601 --> 00:00:59.250
<v Speaker 1>my bumps on the rail by bumps on the boat,</v>

47
00:00:59.251 --> 00:01:00.084
<v Speaker 1>my bumps on the duck,</v>

48
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.590
<v Speaker 1>all this,</v>

49
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.210
<v Speaker 1>it was a silly sort of like a Dr Zeus style nursery rhyme,</v>

50
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.380
<v Speaker 1>rap and,</v>

51
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.710
<v Speaker 1>and the comedy of it was me out in the street sticking my ass on everything and</v>

52
00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.670
<v Speaker 1>confusing people and filming the reactions,</v>

53
00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:12.090
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

54
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.380
<v Speaker 1>And singing the silly song.</v>

55
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.330
<v Speaker 1>And then we played it on my show and we said,</v>

56
00:01:15.331 --> 00:01:18.330
<v Speaker 1>we want this to go to number one on total request live,</v>

57
00:01:18.331 --> 00:01:18.661
<v Speaker 1>which is,</v>

58
00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:18.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

59
00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:23.130
<v Speaker 1>their countdown music show that they would have every night hosted by Carson</v>

60
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.340
<v Speaker 1>Daly.</v>

61
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.761
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

62
00:01:23.761 --> 00:01:24.594
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

63
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.160
<v Speaker 1>so we played it on Seattle radio and it went to number one instantly.</v>

64
00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:30.630
<v Speaker 1>This was when my show was on MTV.</v>

65
00:01:30.631 --> 00:01:30.840
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

66
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.081
<v Speaker 1>it was,</v>

67
00:01:31.081 --> 00:01:32.520
<v Speaker 1>it was really doing well,</v>

68
00:01:32.521 --> 00:01:33.090
<v Speaker 1>show and empty.</v>

69
00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.890
<v Speaker 1>The show is doing well on MTV people.</v>

70
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:35.731
<v Speaker 1>It went to number one,</v>

71
00:01:35.731 --> 00:01:40.290
<v Speaker 1>people saw the absurdity of this song knocking 98 degrees,</v>

72
00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:45.291
<v Speaker 1>Britney Spears in sync and whoever else was on the j Lo I think out of the,</v>

73
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.220
<v Speaker 1>out of the number one spot.</v>

74
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.240
<v Speaker 1>And so we went,</v>

75
00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:48.931
<v Speaker 1>we played on the show,</v>

76
00:01:48.931 --> 00:01:50.280
<v Speaker 1>we asked people to vote for it,</v>

77
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.330
<v Speaker 1>people voted for it.</v>

78
00:01:51.331 --> 00:01:53.730
<v Speaker 1>It went to number one on Tuesday.</v>

79
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.941
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

80
00:01:53.941 --> 00:01:55.500
<v Speaker 1>The show I think aired on a Monday.</v>

81
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.540
<v Speaker 1>It went to number one on a Tuesday.</v>

82
00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:58.440
<v Speaker 1>This is the song.</v>

83
00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.273
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

84
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.910

85
00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:07.360
<v Speaker 1>this song was,</v>

86
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.130
<v Speaker 1>and this was the first uh,</v>

87
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.220
<v Speaker 1>song to be like,</v>

88

89
00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.080

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.760
<v Speaker 1>it was the most stressful time in my life.</v>

149
00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 1>And that's saying something because I'm pretty stressed out right now to now,</v>

150
00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:42.641
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

151
00:03:42.641 --> 00:03:43.391
<v Speaker 1>but most of the time,</v>

152
00:03:43.391 --> 00:03:43.780
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

153
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:44.613
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

154
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.160
<v Speaker 1>so I'm on the show and I'm getting yelled at all the time by everybody.</v>

155
00:03:48.161 --> 00:03:49.360
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's always screaming at each other,</v>

156
00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:49.841
<v Speaker 1>trying to like,</v>

157
00:03:49.841 --> 00:03:50.021
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

158
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:51.850
<v Speaker 1>make the show crazy or make it less crazy.</v>

159
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.391
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

160
00:03:52.391 --> 00:03:52.541
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

161
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:52.751
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

162
00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:53.291
<v Speaker 1>I played ball,</v>

163
00:03:53.291 --> 00:03:55.300
<v Speaker 1>I went and I got a nice plaque and it,</v>

164
00:03:55.301 --> 00:03:55.541
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

165
00:03:55.541 --> 00:03:56.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even to be honest with you,</v>

166
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.731
<v Speaker 1>not eat well.</v>

167
00:03:57.731 --> 00:03:58.564
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

168
00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.991
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

169
00:03:58.991 --> 00:03:59.771
<v Speaker 1>I think of it now.</v>

170
00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:00.071
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

171
00:04:00.071 --> 00:04:00.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

172
00:04:00.251 --> 00:04:02.050
<v Speaker 1>we could have rode that thing a little further.</v>

173
00:04:02.051 --> 00:04:03.370
<v Speaker 1>I could have put out record,</v>

174
00:04:03.371 --> 00:04:04.204
<v Speaker 1>I probably could,</v>

175
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:04.991
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

176
00:04:04.991 --> 00:04:06.010
<v Speaker 1>had some fun with that.</v>

177
00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.173
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

178
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.540
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

179
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.260
<v Speaker 1>that's what happened.</v>

180
00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.070
<v Speaker 1>That's what happened.</v>

181
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:09.460
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

182
00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:10.470
<v Speaker 1>that's interesting man.</v>

183
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.470
<v Speaker 1>You got Fox got fucked by the corporations.</v>

184
00:04:13.471 --> 00:04:13.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

185
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:14.130
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

186
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.301
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

187
00:04:14.301 --> 00:04:15.134
<v Speaker 1>it would make sense to other,</v>

188
00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.740
<v Speaker 1>they would probably cost him a fuck load of money if they had already pre tape</v>

189
00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.770
<v Speaker 1>thing there reshoot five shows and it's like,</v>

190
00:04:19.771 --> 00:04:20.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

191
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.931
<v Speaker 1>how crazy is that?</v>

192
00:04:20.931 --> 00:04:23.360
<v Speaker 1>And now you find out what their rankings are like total,</v>

193
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:24.540
<v Speaker 1>they paid them up.</v>

194
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.300
<v Speaker 1>It probably had deals with the record company.</v>

195
00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.760
<v Speaker 1>Like we need to push 98 degrees and a here's $100,000.</v>

196
00:04:29.761 --> 00:04:30.670
<v Speaker 1>We need to get to do that.</v>

197
00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:32.700
<v Speaker 1>Probably it's so that's illegal.</v>

198
00:04:32.701 --> 00:04:33.534
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's,</v>

199
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:34.803
<v Speaker 1>Delphine did that.</v>

200
00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.880
<v Speaker 1>They did that.</v>

201
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.470
<v Speaker 1>I never heard any just making shit up.</v>

202
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.710
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

203
00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.980
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

204
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm just throwing shit on the table.</v>

205
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:41.490
<v Speaker 1>I have never did anything like that.</v>

206
00:04:41.491 --> 00:04:42.480
<v Speaker 1>I think it was just basically,</v>

207
00:04:42.481 --> 00:04:43.710
<v Speaker 1>it was a very strange week.</v>

208
00:04:43.711 --> 00:04:43.951
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

209
00:04:43.951 --> 00:04:44.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

210
00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.271
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

211
00:04:44.271 --> 00:04:44.600
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

212
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.130
<v Speaker 1>they'd sort of,</v>

213
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.110
<v Speaker 1>if it wasn't for that week,</v>

214
00:04:46.111 --> 00:04:47.880
<v Speaker 1>that song could have stayed on the countdown.</v>

215
00:04:47.881 --> 00:04:48.750
<v Speaker 1>And because I can't,</v>

216
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:49.321
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

217
00:04:49.321 --> 00:04:49.531
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

218
00:04:49.531 --> 00:04:49.671
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

219
00:04:49.671 --> 00:04:49.980
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

220
00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:50.940
<v Speaker 1>I've told that story before.</v>

221
00:04:50.941 --> 00:04:52.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't think anyone at MTV cares anymore about that.</v>

222
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.881
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

223
00:04:53.881 --> 00:04:54.714
<v Speaker 1>why would they care?</v>

224
00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:55.763
<v Speaker 1>Fuck fucked you.</v>

225
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:56.970
<v Speaker 1>You're the one supposed to care.</v>

226
00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.930
