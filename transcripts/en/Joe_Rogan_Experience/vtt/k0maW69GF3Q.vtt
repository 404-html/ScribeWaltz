WEBVTT

1
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.800
<v Speaker 1>And we're live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was nice to take a break,</v>

2
00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:07.110
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taking a break from anything is a good</v>

3
00:00:07.111 --> 00:00:08.520
<v Speaker 1>move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really is.</v>

4
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.350
<v Speaker 1>Take just a few days off the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get all excited to come back and do it.</v>

5
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Little refresher.</v>

6
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.250
<v Speaker 1>A little refresher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

7
00:00:17.251 --> 00:00:18.150
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's up brother?</v>

8
00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:19.050
<v Speaker 1>How are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good to see you.</v>

9
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm good man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We going on there.</v>

10
00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is my shirt that uh,</v>

11
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.260
<v Speaker 1>talks about how George Washington was</v>
<v Speaker 1>alive today.</v>

12
00:00:26.261 --> 00:00:28.960
<v Speaker 1>They throw him in jail because he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking weed and murdering.</v>

13
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:30.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>

14
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:32.010
<v Speaker 1>he grew pot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

15
00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:33.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was pretty open about it.</v>

16
00:00:33.301 --> 00:00:35.580
<v Speaker 1>He talked about how they should sow that</v>
<v Speaker 1>seed everywhere.</v>

17
00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:36.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>

18
00:00:36.481 --> 00:00:38.070
<v Speaker 1>It's a miracle plant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Makes me feel good.</v>

19
00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:40.200
<v Speaker 1>It's good for good for clothes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could paper.</v>

20
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.600
<v Speaker 1>Did they smoke it though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did the founding fathers smoke it?</v>

21
00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not like a lot of direct</v>

22
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:45.990
<v Speaker 1>reports.</v>

23
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't think about them actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>smoking it,</v>

24
00:00:47.851 --> 00:00:50.400
<v Speaker 1>but if they hadn't figured that out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty savvy.</v>

25
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.830
<v Speaker 1>I think they got that down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wondered though,</v>

26
00:00:52.831 --> 00:00:56.190
<v Speaker 1>because if you were like growing</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and you were using it for one</v>

27
00:00:56.191 --> 00:00:58.590
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like say if you were growing Kale and</v>

28
00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:00.180
<v Speaker 1>you were eating it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you wouldn't be like,</v>

29
00:01:00.181 --> 00:01:05.181
<v Speaker 1>let's smoke this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like live your whole life and not know</v>

30
00:01:05.881 --> 00:01:08.880
<v Speaker 1>the Kale could get you to God's front</v>
<v Speaker 1>door.</v>

31
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.700
<v Speaker 1>You don't think that smell though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.720
<v Speaker 1>they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>miss that smell,</v>

33
00:01:12.721 --> 00:01:14.800
<v Speaker 1>this herb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would have eaten it.</v>

34
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Have made a tea out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would have done something isn't it?</v>

35
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.950
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't have to be cooked though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In order to be psychoactive.</v>

36
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm the worst pothead ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should know this.</v>

37
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm like such a pot advocate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should know.</v>

38
00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:30.810
<v Speaker 1>Like if you're going to get in trouble</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you eat a bunch of your pot,</v>

39
00:01:30.811 --> 00:01:31.530
<v Speaker 1>do you get high up?</v>

40
00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure you don't.</v>

41
00:01:34.351 --> 00:01:35.220
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

42
00:01:35.221 --> 00:01:40.221
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one of the reasons why</v>
<v Speaker 1>people really enjoy a juice pot.</v>

43
00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.710
<v Speaker 1>Apparently the health benefits of</v>
<v Speaker 1>juicing pot,</v>

44
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.240
<v Speaker 1>of taking the fresh non dried leaves and</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it like wheat grass juice is</v>

45
00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:50.190
<v Speaker 1>incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's supposed to be really good for you.</v>

46
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.450
<v Speaker 1>I believe that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

47
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it smell.</v>

48
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.840
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't smell like something you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to eat,</v>

49
00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you smell pot it's like it's</v>

50
00:01:57.751 --> 00:01:59.460
<v Speaker 1>aromatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a beautiful plant.</v>

51
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.540
<v Speaker 1>A flag of tea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

52
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.570
<v Speaker 1>That was out in the wild data probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you up.</v>

53
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.510
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a fat issue though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they always do it with</v>

54
00:02:06.511 --> 00:02:07.860
<v Speaker 1>butter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

55
00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.530
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a or the oils I should</v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

56
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.110
<v Speaker 1>Goddammit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we got it.</v>

57
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.150
<v Speaker 1>People get so mad when you don't know</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

58
00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.580
<v Speaker 1>Pothead Carter's going to get revoked.</v>

59
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.240
<v Speaker 1>Research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

60
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.730
<v Speaker 1>I definitely know it can get you high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll vouch for that.</v>

61
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:24.691
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think.</v>

62
00:02:24.691 --> 00:02:27.010
<v Speaker 1>I just still think eating it raw can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

63
00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.210
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people get so pissed off if you were</v>

64
00:02:30.211 --> 00:02:34.650
<v Speaker 1>wrong about anything in these long</v>
<v Speaker 1>rambling shit.</v>

65
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:38.100
<v Speaker 1>Talking sessions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No vetting of information.</v>

66
00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.070
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand 16 man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enough.</v>

67
00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.430
<v Speaker 1>Enough of your misinformation and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know,</v>

68
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it but it does it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is amazing though that all these guys</v>

69
00:02:49.561 --> 00:02:53.830
<v Speaker 1>used it for so many different things and</v>
<v Speaker 1>somehow along the line,</v>

70
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.230
<v Speaker 1>just a couple hundred years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it became demonized and got people</v>

71
00:02:58.231 --> 00:03:01.390
<v Speaker 1>locked up in jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very Declaration of independence written</v>

72
00:03:01.391 --> 00:03:04.690
<v Speaker 1>on the plant that got made illegal and</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the drafts,</v>

73
00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.580
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the drafts is written on hemp</v>

74
00:03:06.581 --> 00:03:09.700
<v Speaker 1>paper and papers the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever had him paper before?</v>

75
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.030
<v Speaker 1>Now it's insanely durable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird.</v>

76
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.930
<v Speaker 1>It's such a weird plant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a weird thing about marijuana is</v>

77
00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.990
<v Speaker 1>have you ever held a stock a marijuana</v>
<v Speaker 1>tree stock?</v>

78
00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:24.400
<v Speaker 1>Now it's incredible because it feels</v>
<v Speaker 1>like styrofoam in in,</v>

79
00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.940
<v Speaker 1>in terms of like how light it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really hard like oak.</v>

80
00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.360
<v Speaker 1>It's bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking alien plant.</v>

81
00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.910
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you stop and think about all the</v>

82
00:03:33.911 --> 00:03:38.911
<v Speaker 1>things that that one plant provides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has a full amino acid profile,</v>

83
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.200
<v Speaker 1>but almost like a meat only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's only a few other plants I</v>

84
00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:49.201
<v Speaker 1>believe keenwah and a couple others are</v>
<v Speaker 1>similar in that they have a full amino</v>

85
00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:52.630
<v Speaker 1>acid profile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can make oil that you could.</v>

86
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.800
<v Speaker 1>You could heat your house with it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could build a house with it with</v>

87
00:03:56.801 --> 00:03:58.960
<v Speaker 1>hempcrete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ever seen that hempcrete stuff,</v>

88
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.140
<v Speaker 1>but I've heard my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make concrete with hemp and</v>

89
00:04:02.141 --> 00:04:07.141
<v Speaker 1>apparently has antimicrobial properties</v>
<v Speaker 1>where it makes it really an effective</v>

90
00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.050
<v Speaker 1>building method and places that have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of mold,</v>

91
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.050
<v Speaker 1>like high mold content,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like high moisture content.</v>

92
00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.150
<v Speaker 1>It's insanely durable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It apparently will last forever.</v>

93
00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:20.950
<v Speaker 1>It's really light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is hempcrete.</v>

94
00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:25.810
<v Speaker 1>This is the shit you make this with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hemp has massive installation</v>

95
00:04:25.811 --> 00:04:27.980
<v Speaker 1>properties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

96
00:04:27.981 --> 00:04:30.490
<v Speaker 1>Energy efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is like an alien gift.</v>

97
00:04:30.491 --> 00:04:31.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy.</v>

98
00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.890
<v Speaker 1>Just went down and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here you go,</v>

99
00:04:32.891 --> 00:04:37.510
<v Speaker 1>humans for so many things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen all the stuff they're</v>

100
00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:42.470
<v Speaker 1>doing with cbd oil and children that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have epilepsy?</v>

101
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.340
<v Speaker 1>I have been following that closely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking wipes it out.</v>

102
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another thing apparently there's really</v>

103
00:04:47.621 --> 00:04:51.190
<v Speaker 1>good for children that have epilepsy is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going into ketosis.</v>

104
00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:56.230
<v Speaker 1>Akita genic diet apparently like high</v>
<v Speaker 1>fat,</v>

105
00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.540
<v Speaker 1>high fat content foods low a low simple</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrate foods.</v>

106
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently has a radical effect on</v>

107
00:05:04.061 --> 00:05:06.280
<v Speaker 1>children with epilepsy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense.</v>

108
00:05:06.281 --> 00:05:09.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean a lot of what the brain is brain</v>

109
00:05:09.161 --> 00:05:11.130
<v Speaker 1>is mostly made up of fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

110
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.380
<v Speaker 1>and I think a lot of times we don't pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to the raw materials that our</v>

111
00:05:14.381 --> 00:05:15.400
<v Speaker 1>body's made up of.</v>

112
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like your brain is made up of largely</v>

113
00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:21.430
<v Speaker 1>fatty content and it's shown in a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>different studies that fat is good for</v>

114
00:05:21.431 --> 00:05:23.800
<v Speaker 1>the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these issues that are coming from the</v>

115
00:05:23.801 --> 00:05:26.230
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's an issue with some of the</v>

116
00:05:26.231 --> 00:05:28.600
<v Speaker 1>raw material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you just supply it more of what</v>

117
00:05:28.601 --> 00:05:30.030
<v Speaker 1>it's made of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

118
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.230
<v Speaker 1>that's probably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

119
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.880
<v Speaker 1>And also what makes sense to me is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what people ate for thousands and</v>

120
00:05:36.881 --> 00:05:40.900
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just ate plants that grew out of</v>

121
00:05:40.901 --> 00:05:43.690
<v Speaker 1>the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like normal stuff and meats and fishes</v>

122
00:05:43.691 --> 00:05:48.500
<v Speaker 1>and whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could get a fishes the fish and you</v>

123
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.500
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and whatever they could catch and eat.</v>

124
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.830
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have spaghetti,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

125
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.110
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have all this stuff that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking love now.</v>

126
00:05:56.111 --> 00:05:58.160
<v Speaker 1>Bread bread is awesome.</v>

127
00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:00.530
<v Speaker 2>Goddammit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bread is why is it so bad for you?</v>

128
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.010
<v Speaker 2>Well really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's a lot of people who argue</v>

129
00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:07.010
<v Speaker 2>that the bread is only bad for you</v>
<v Speaker 2>because of how we prepare it.</v>

130
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.270
<v Speaker 2>We allow the heat to dry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which has it developed this heightened</v>

131
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.970
<v Speaker 2>layer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this kind of protective layer so that</v>

132
00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:15.880
<v Speaker 2>the seed could survive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

133
00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.200
<v Speaker 2>conditions where it wasn't going</v>
<v Speaker 2>directly into the soil,</v>

134
00:06:18.201 --> 00:06:20.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seeds or have evolved to survive.</v>

135
00:06:20.421 --> 00:06:22.670
<v Speaker 2>And the way that we prepare it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not germinated,</v>

136
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.420
<v Speaker 2>sprouted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that hard layer is what makes it</v>

137
00:06:26.421 --> 00:06:29.330
<v Speaker 2>really hard to digest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or if you get like a sprouted bread,</v>

138
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people say that the health</v>

139
00:06:31.251 --> 00:06:35.600
<v Speaker 2>benefits are pretty good and all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and a lot of the negative is mitigated.</v>

140
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.910
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's what I eat most of the time.</v>

141
00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.490
<v Speaker 2>And he did Zucchini bread,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a sprouted bread,</v>

142
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:41.630
<v Speaker 2>which,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

143
00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:43.440
<v Speaker 2>not nearly is delicious now.</v>

144
00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:45.770
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely not.</v>

145
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:49.470
<v Speaker 2>The other one that's supposedly good is</v>
<v Speaker 2>sour dough bread because sourdough,</v>

146
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:50.210
<v Speaker 2>they use,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

147
00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:51.043
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

148
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:52.730
<v Speaker 2>they have a culture in there that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>fermenting,</v>

149
00:06:52.731 --> 00:06:54.440
<v Speaker 2>that's what's actually causing it to be</v>
<v Speaker 2>sour.</v>

150
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:56.900
<v Speaker 2>And that's partially digesting some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

151
00:06:57.110 --> 00:06:59.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hard parts of the wheat to digest.</v>

152
00:06:59.121 --> 00:07:03.560
<v Speaker 2>So it's almost coming to you like pre</v>
<v Speaker 2>digest it a little bit by the bacteria</v>

153
00:07:03.561 --> 00:07:06.350
<v Speaker 2>that makes it sour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a lot easier on your stomach.</v>

154
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:07.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd heard that.</v>

155
00:07:07.821 --> 00:07:10.340
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like for even there's some gluten free</v>

156
00:07:10.341 --> 00:07:12.660
<v Speaker 2>versions of sourdough bread,</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible],</v>

157
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:16.220
<v Speaker 2>which is a apparently even better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have something I haven't,</v>

158
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.020
<v Speaker 2>I haven't done anything with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of.</v>

159
00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:20.150
<v Speaker 2>The problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that when your stomach gets</v>

160
00:07:20.151 --> 00:07:22.130
<v Speaker 2>inflammation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't just go locally in your</v>

161
00:07:22.131 --> 00:07:24.380
<v Speaker 2>stomach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then it creates these proinflammatory</v>

162
00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.790
<v Speaker 2>cytokines which go cross the blood clot</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the bloodstream into the blood brain</v>

163
00:07:28.791 --> 00:07:30.590
<v Speaker 2>barrier and then you get that Kinda</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

164
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:33.500
<v Speaker 2>foggy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shitty feeling throughout your whole</v>

165
00:07:33.501 --> 00:07:33.920
<v Speaker 2>body.</v>

166
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.521
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

167
00:07:34.521 --> 00:07:36.560
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people talk about it like leaky</v>
<v Speaker 2>gut,</v>

168
00:07:36.561 --> 00:07:38.840
<v Speaker 2>but when inflammation is there and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>gut,</v>

169
00:07:38.841 --> 00:07:42.530
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot easier for it to go systemic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so keeping that,</v>

170
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:45.620
<v Speaker 2>keeping that down to a minimum is really</v>
<v Speaker 2>key for,</v>

171
00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:46.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>performance.</v>

172
00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:50.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pasta Comas are legit for sure.</v>

173
00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.150
<v Speaker 2>Fucking real mature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

174
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:56.450
<v Speaker 2>my mom used to make this insane lasagna</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you'd eat the Lasagna,</v>

175
00:07:56.451 --> 00:08:01.451
<v Speaker 2>you better know how many plans bitch</v>
<v Speaker 2>is on using your system.</v>

176
00:08:01.641 --> 00:08:03.690
<v Speaker 2>That ricotta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

177
00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.180
<v Speaker 2>it was so good though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>God dammit.</v>

178
00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:11.660
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had gluten free pasta written</v>

179
00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.550
<v Speaker 2>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been getting into that.</v>

180
00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:15.740
<v Speaker 2>I wished I'm so glad Joey Diaz isn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

181
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:20.950
<v Speaker 2>He'd be screaming fucking gluten,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't give you the same effect.</v>

182
00:08:21.711 --> 00:08:24.230
<v Speaker 2>It's like you get but you don't have</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

183
00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:25.220
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

184
00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:29.150
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people associate with a good</v>
<v Speaker 2>meal and feeling of just being,</v>

185
00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:31.070
<v Speaker 2>just sedated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

186
00:08:31.071 --> 00:08:32.180
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was great.</v>

187
00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:32.991
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

188
00:08:32.991 --> 00:08:36.560
<v Speaker 2>it's weird how that works until you have</v>
<v Speaker 2>to do something.</v>

189
00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:37.730
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

190
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:40.670
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got work to do or have that big lunch.</v>

191
00:08:40.671 --> 00:08:43.310
<v Speaker 2>And you got meetings afterwards and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just pounding coffee.</v>

192
00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:46.730
<v Speaker 2>Just like get it together to death</v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't work.</v>

193
00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.520
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really work that well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She is the way to go.</v>

194
00:08:49.521 --> 00:08:50.390
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

195
00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:53.150
<v Speaker 2>If you're in that situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really should be pounding enzymes,</v>

196
00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 2>digestive enzymes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even additional if you</v>

197
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.080
<v Speaker 3>really have a difficult meal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

198
00:08:58.081 --> 00:09:01.860
<v Speaker 3>taking some hydrochloric acid along with</v>
<v Speaker 3>the enzymes is going to be great.</v>

199
00:09:01.861 --> 00:09:03.500
<v Speaker 3>But enzymes are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are key.</v>

200
00:09:03.950 --> 00:09:04.510
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

201
00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:08.400
<v Speaker 3>it's so fascinating for me that for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>longest time when people thought about</v>

202
00:09:08.401 --> 00:09:10.380
<v Speaker 3>food and nutrition,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they f they thought,</v>

203
00:09:10.381 --> 00:09:13.080
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he eat a healthy balanced diet and you</v>

204
00:09:13.081 --> 00:09:14.340
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's pretty much it.</v>

205
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:16.530
<v Speaker 3>That's really all you need.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you want to be a sensible person,</v>

206
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:19.350
<v Speaker 3>if you want to really push the fringes</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Jacqueline Lane,</v>

207
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:21.740
<v Speaker 3>he used to fucking eat a bucket of pills</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyday.</v>

208
00:09:21.780 --> 00:09:22.700
<v Speaker 3>Didn't he?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Didn't,</v>

209
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:25.680
<v Speaker 3>wasn't Jack Lillian like a crazy</v>
<v Speaker 3>supplement taker guy?</v>

210
00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:26.670
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't surprise me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

211
00:09:26.671 --> 00:09:28.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm pretty sure he was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

212
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.450
<v Speaker 3>or uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>another one is a homeboy.</v>

213
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:37.520
<v Speaker 3>The guy wants to live forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ray Kurzweil Kurzweil,</v>

214
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:41.860
<v Speaker 3>he explained to me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I interviewed him once for this Scifi</v>

215
00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:43.470
<v Speaker 3>show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so fucking cool.</v>

216
00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:48.600
<v Speaker 3>Just me and Ray Kurzweil chilling in his</v>
<v Speaker 3>apartment in San Francisco for like an</v>

217
00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:53.720
<v Speaker 3>hour and a half talking about to life</v>
<v Speaker 3>and possibilities and all the potential</v>

218
00:09:55.141 --> 00:09:59.070
<v Speaker 3>future technologies that are going to</v>
<v Speaker 3>extend our life thousands and thousands</v>

219
00:09:59.070 --> 00:09:59.370
<v Speaker 3>of years.</v>

220
00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:01.530
<v Speaker 3>But that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't fuck around.</v>

221
00:10:01.830 --> 00:10:04.530
<v Speaker 3>He takes a gigantic bucket of pills</v>
<v Speaker 3>everyday,</v>

222
00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:07.050
<v Speaker 3>which I'm not sure is the right way to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it,</v>

223
00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:07.903
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

224
00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:08.890
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

225
00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:11.490
<v Speaker 3>Is it foods?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it foods and supplements?</v>

226
00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:13.440
<v Speaker 3>I think you've got to really just look</v>
<v Speaker 3>at what,</v>

227
00:10:13.570 --> 00:10:16.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what you particularly need to know and</v>

228
00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:17.970
<v Speaker 3>just targeted for that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

229
00:10:17.971 --> 00:10:20.190
<v Speaker 3>I think a lot of things are what you</v>
<v Speaker 3>want,</v>

230
00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:21.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of it is just like,</v>

231
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:24.030
<v Speaker 3>what's going to help your performance?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's going to help you reach your</v>

232
00:10:24.031 --> 00:10:25.200
<v Speaker 3>goal?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is your goal?</v>

233
00:10:25.201 --> 00:10:26.340
<v Speaker 3>For him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's live forever,</v>

234
00:10:26.341 --> 00:10:28.530
<v Speaker 3>so he's probably trying a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 3>different things,</v>

235
00:10:28.531 --> 00:10:30.420
<v Speaker 3>but he's a little bit frantic about</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

236
00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:35.240
<v Speaker 3>He's a little concerned that he's not</v>
<v Speaker 3>gonna make it til this technology older</v>

237
00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:36.890
<v Speaker 3>than us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like 70,</v>

238
00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.930
<v Speaker 3>70.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But what I was going to get at is that</v>

239
00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:45.500
<v Speaker 3>when they started doing grass fed foods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like grass fed beef became all the rage</v>

240
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:49.980
<v Speaker 3>and people start noticing the difference</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the actual size of the stakes,</v>

241
00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:54.540
<v Speaker 3>like if you get a tenderloin or if you</v>
<v Speaker 3>get a New York strip from a grass fed</v>

242
00:10:54.541 --> 00:10:56.910
<v Speaker 3>animal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like can considerably smaller piece</v>

243
00:10:56.911 --> 00:10:59.490
<v Speaker 3>of meat and then the fat looks</v>
<v Speaker 3>different.</v>

244
00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.040
<v Speaker 3>The fat is a yellow fat instead of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>white fat.</v>

245
00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:04.290
<v Speaker 3>And then when I started getting into</v>
<v Speaker 3>hunting,</v>

246
00:11:04.530 --> 00:11:09.060
<v Speaker 3>one of the weirder things that I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>found was Steven Rinella told me about</v>

247
00:11:09.061 --> 00:11:14.061
<v Speaker 3>blueberry bears and that the most</v>
<v Speaker 3>delicious meat is these black bears in</v>

248
00:11:14.191 --> 00:11:17.430
<v Speaker 3>Alaska and Canada as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anywhere they have blueberries,</v>

249
00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.260
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they're getting ready to get into</v>

250
00:11:19.261 --> 00:11:22.320
<v Speaker 3>hibernation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they feast on blueberries to the point</v>

251
00:11:22.321 --> 00:11:27.060
<v Speaker 3>where their flesh smells like</v>
<v Speaker 3>blueberries and they're fat becomes</v>

252
00:11:27.061 --> 00:11:29.580
<v Speaker 3>purple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it changes your body.</v>

253
00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:34.410
<v Speaker 3>And it made me think like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what about fucking twinkies and shit?</v>

254
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:36.510
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what about Coca Cola?</v>

255
00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.940
<v Speaker 3>What is all that doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your fat content?</v>

256
00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:40.840
<v Speaker 3>What is it doing to your body?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

257
00:11:40.841 --> 00:11:45.030
<v Speaker 3>like how much of what you are like if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you ever smell someone that's like</v>

258
00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:47.820
<v Speaker 3>unhealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like give her a date and unhealthy girl</v>

259
00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:49.610
<v Speaker 3>or your own self when you're sick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not Me Bro.</v>

260
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:50.640
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the time.</v>

261
00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.193
<v Speaker 3>Let's.</v>

262
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:55.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll,</v>

263
00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:55.930
<v Speaker 2>that'll do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you,</v>

264
00:11:55.931 --> 00:11:58.450
<v Speaker 2>if the smell is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that was one of our primal cues.</v>

265
00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:00.580
<v Speaker 2>You sniff somebody and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you healthy?</v>

266
00:12:00.581 --> 00:12:01.270
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how's your,</v>

267
00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:02.980
<v Speaker 2>how's your gut biome?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what someone's.</v>

268
00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:04.270
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like is that.</v>

269
00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:07.523
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally.</v>

270
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.390
<v Speaker 2>But I think um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

271
00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:13.150
<v Speaker 2>now we're in this paradigm where it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>not just you are what you eat because</v>

272
00:12:13.151 --> 00:12:16.900
<v Speaker 2>that's really true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your body is made up of the input that</v>

273
00:12:16.901 --> 00:12:19.540
<v Speaker 2>you eat 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what makes up your body.</v>

274
00:12:19.541 --> 00:12:20.950
<v Speaker 2>And I think we forget about that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but.</v>

275
00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:22.680
<v Speaker 2>So we're not only what we eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what we're,</v>

276
00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.560
<v Speaker 2>what we eat eight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

277
00:12:24.561 --> 00:12:28.160
<v Speaker 2>so we're what the animals ate because</v>
<v Speaker 2>their body's made up of what they ate.</v>

278
00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.830
<v Speaker 2>And then when you're looking at</v>
<v Speaker 2>vegetables,</v>

279
00:12:29.831 --> 00:12:33.550
<v Speaker 2>I think sometimes people ignore the fact</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the vegetables are drawing these</v>

280
00:12:33.551 --> 00:12:34.630
<v Speaker 2>minerals from the soil.</v>

281
00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:37.630
<v Speaker 2>So what's the soil like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it soil that's been farm forever and</v>

282
00:12:37.631 --> 00:12:41.050
<v Speaker 2>they just put a limited array of</v>
<v Speaker 2>fertilizer on there just enough to get</v>

283
00:12:41.051 --> 00:12:43.090
<v Speaker 2>it to go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well then maybe you're not getting</v>

284
00:12:43.091 --> 00:12:45.640
<v Speaker 2>enough minerals because the plants don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have enough minerals.</v>

285
00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:49.270
<v Speaker 2>So I think that's scenario that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 2>really kind of looking keenly on because</v>

286
00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:52.000
<v Speaker 2>the one thing that I've done this year</v>
<v Speaker 2>differently is really started</v>

287
00:12:52.001 --> 00:12:55.840
<v Speaker 2>supplementing with minerals and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>made a huge difference in my energy</v>

288
00:12:55.841 --> 00:12:57.460
<v Speaker 2>levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you doing?</v>

289
00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:01.150
<v Speaker 2>I take a fulvic mineral and I take it a</v>
<v Speaker 2>couple of different ways.</v>

290
00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.190
<v Speaker 2>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a different.</v>

291
00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:07.600
<v Speaker 2>It's like fulvic acid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a type of compound in the soil that</v>

292
00:13:07.601 --> 00:13:11.200
<v Speaker 2>has a really wide array of trace</v>
<v Speaker 2>minerals and so you can get it.</v>

293
00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:14.920
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty much from the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get it from all over the place.</v>

294
00:13:14.921 --> 00:13:17.830
<v Speaker 2>It's really like densely concentrated</v>
<v Speaker 2>old,</v>

295
00:13:17.831 --> 00:13:19.500
<v Speaker 2>old vegetation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

296
00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.340
<v Speaker 2>that is turning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>turning the soil.</v>

297
00:13:21.770 --> 00:13:22.840
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

298
00:13:22.841 --> 00:13:25.360
<v Speaker 2>And then Himalayan Sea salt of course is</v>
<v Speaker 2>another great resource.</v>

299
00:13:25.361 --> 00:13:27.790
<v Speaker 2>But the combination of like</v>
<v Speaker 2>intentionally giving those,</v>

300
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:33.030
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm giving my body the</v>
<v Speaker 2>building blocks to make the body to do</v>

301
00:13:33.101 --> 00:13:36.070
<v Speaker 2>what it needs to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like all of our clans and skin and</v>

302
00:13:36.071 --> 00:13:38.860
<v Speaker 2>organs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's comprised largely of these elements</v>

303
00:13:38.861 --> 00:13:42.220
<v Speaker 2>and minerals and these different things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I feel like sometimes the body's</v>

304
00:13:42.221 --> 00:13:44.470
<v Speaker 2>reaching for spare parts and the garage</v>
<v Speaker 2>is empty.</v>

305
00:13:44.471 --> 00:13:46.270
<v Speaker 2>It's like Duh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell?</v>

306
00:13:46.271 --> 00:13:49.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't have this mineral that I need to</v>
<v Speaker 2>repair myself.</v>

307
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:50.260
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's not part of what</v>

308
00:13:50.261 --> 00:13:51.940
<v Speaker 2>osteoporosis is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

309
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:54.790
<v Speaker 2>Your body drawing calcium literally from</v>
<v Speaker 2>your bones.</v>

310
00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:56.680
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then we do that naturally.</v>

311
00:13:56.681 --> 00:13:59.830
<v Speaker 2>Another reason why we don't have that</v>
<v Speaker 2>many minerals is we do that naturally</v>

312
00:13:59.831 --> 00:14:03.100
<v Speaker 2>when we run a little bit acidic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for drinking coffee and alcohol and</v>

313
00:14:03.101 --> 00:14:06.760
<v Speaker 2>these things are Ph may not change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the reason it doesn't change is the</v>

314
00:14:06.761 --> 00:14:09.730
<v Speaker 2>body uses the minerals from things like</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bones,</v>

315
00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:13.160
<v Speaker 2>calcium carbonate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the traditional antacid,</v>

316
00:14:13.161 --> 00:14:14.380
<v Speaker 2>something that buffer the acid.</v>

317
00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:18.870
<v Speaker 2>So it buffers the acid within the body</v>
<v Speaker 2>by utilizing available minerals.</v>

318
00:14:18.871 --> 00:14:23.260
<v Speaker 2>So we get an even a greater mineral</v>
<v Speaker 2>depletion if we're running more acidic,</v>

319
00:14:23.261 --> 00:14:26.140
<v Speaker 2>which is one of the reasons why I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>an alkaline diet is helpful,</v>

320
00:14:26.290 --> 00:14:29.860
<v Speaker 2>but you can kind of hack that by just</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking a lot more minerals so you have</v>

321
00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.500
<v Speaker 2>more available to buffer out your acidic</v>
<v Speaker 2>diet,</v>

322
00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:36.220
<v Speaker 2>not that you should be drinking booze</v>
<v Speaker 2>and eating sugar and coffee anyways,</v>

323
00:14:36.221 --> 00:14:37.680
<v Speaker 2>but we're all going to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all humans.</v>

324
00:14:37.681 --> 00:14:40.570
<v Speaker 2>So if you're going to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting more minerals in your diet is</v>

325
00:14:40.571 --> 00:14:43.660
<v Speaker 2>going to be huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you fuck around with colloidal</v>

326
00:14:43.661 --> 00:14:47.050
<v Speaker 2>minerals?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We take that stuff into that for awhile</v>

327
00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:49.550
<v Speaker 2>and I got some benefits of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

328
00:14:49.810 --> 00:14:51.400
<v Speaker 2>for whatever reason I stopped drinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

329
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

330
00:14:52.190 --> 00:14:54.530
<v Speaker 2>for me it's just fulvic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's fulvic acid,</v>

331
00:14:54.531 --> 00:14:55.220
<v Speaker 2>humic acid.</v>

332
00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:56.990
<v Speaker 2>I found that the humic acid a little</v>
<v Speaker 2>heavy,</v>

333
00:14:56.991 --> 00:15:00.620
<v Speaker 2>it weighs on my digestion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but fulvic acid is a little cleaner.</v>

334
00:15:00.621 --> 00:15:03.560
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I absorb it better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So every time I'm making a drink,</v>

335
00:15:03.561 --> 00:15:07.130
<v Speaker 2>I get those mountain valley spring</v>
<v Speaker 2>waters and my thing is just a little bit</v>

336
00:15:07.131 --> 00:15:09.800
<v Speaker 2>of Himalayan salt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe two grams and then a little scoop</v>

337
00:15:09.801 --> 00:15:14.801
<v Speaker 2>of the fulvic mineral powder and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and drink that and huge difference and</v>

338
00:15:14.901 --> 00:15:18.050
<v Speaker 2>I've given it to a lot of people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>have had some energy issues,</v>

339
00:15:18.051 --> 00:15:20.710
<v Speaker 2>just things not going quite right and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

340
00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:23.050
<v Speaker 2>made a huge difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's something I'm really kind of</v>

341
00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:25.580
<v Speaker 2>looking at for 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>

342
00:15:25.710 --> 00:15:26.543
<v Speaker 3>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

343
00:15:26.940 --> 00:15:29.190
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to get really in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>probiotics is here.</v>

344
00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:31.590
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a Rhonda Patrick on the podcast</v>

345
00:15:31.591 --> 00:15:34.770
<v Speaker 3>and she was talking to me about these</v>
<v Speaker 3>really powerful probiotics.</v>

346
00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:39.210
<v Speaker 3>So I'm ordering those this week and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to get started on trying out</v>

347
00:15:39.211 --> 00:15:42.570
<v Speaker 3>different probiotics because I'm a</v>
<v Speaker 3>regular drinker of that Kombucha,</v>

348
00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.700
<v Speaker 3>that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>GTS,</v>

349
00:15:44.701 --> 00:15:45.990
<v Speaker 3>Kombucha.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No bullshit.</v>

350
00:15:45.991 --> 00:15:49.730
<v Speaker 3>I drank for a day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three to four a day every day.</v>

351
00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:52.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm constantly restocking on that shit</v>

352
00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.150
<v Speaker 3>and it makes a massive difference,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

353
00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:57.440
<v Speaker 3>Like having good gut biome having good</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>

354
00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:59.790
<v Speaker 3>I've been eating a lot of his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

355
00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:03.870
<v Speaker 3>raw sauerkraut and raw fermented beets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

356
00:16:03.871 --> 00:16:08.070
<v Speaker 3>Kimchi and fermented plants and foods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're doing that,</v>

357
00:16:08.071 --> 00:16:11.480
<v Speaker 3>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're literally taking in raw like</v>

358
00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:16.200
<v Speaker 3>soldiers told to fight off all the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit that's going on inside your body.</v>

359
00:16:16.830 --> 00:16:17.420
<v Speaker 3>I think that</v>

360
00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.720
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other big key that we all ignore,</v>

361
00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:22.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of us have taken these courses of</v>

362
00:16:22.671 --> 00:16:25.700
<v Speaker 2>antibiotics and there's a recent study</v>
<v Speaker 2>that came out that showed it takes up to</v>

363
00:16:25.701 --> 00:16:29.900
<v Speaker 2>a year for your gut biome to fully</v>
<v Speaker 2>recover from a course of antibiotics,</v>

364
00:16:29.901 --> 00:16:33.590
<v Speaker 2>a single course of antibiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you're just basically detonating a</v>

365
00:16:33.591 --> 00:16:35.660
<v Speaker 2>nuclear bomb off in your stomach and</v>
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

366
00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:37.910
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this gut flora is responsible for</v>

367
00:16:37.911 --> 00:16:40.430
<v Speaker 2>neurotransmitter production and immune</v>
<v Speaker 2>system production.</v>

368
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:44.690
<v Speaker 2>All kinds of benefits and it may get</v>
<v Speaker 2>even crazier than that because there's</v>

369
00:16:44.691 --> 00:16:48.590
<v Speaker 2>some animal studies now where they took</v>
<v Speaker 2>the gut biome of a really kind of chill</v>

370
00:16:48.591 --> 00:16:52.790
<v Speaker 2>mouse and a really hyper mouse and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>switched the gut biomes of both of these</v>

371
00:16:52.791 --> 00:16:55.760
<v Speaker 2>mice and their personality</v>
<v Speaker 2>characteristics changed.</v>

372
00:16:56.270 --> 00:17:01.270
<v Speaker 2>So like a lot of what we are may be</v>
<v Speaker 2>related directly to our gut flora.</v>

373
00:17:01.761 --> 00:17:06.761
<v Speaker 2>So paying close attention to that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think is that minerals is probably the</v>

374
00:17:07.131 --> 00:17:08.360
<v Speaker 2>two most important things you could do.</v>

375
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:11.960
<v Speaker 3>That's a really insane thing when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop and think about it.</v>

376
00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:15.410
<v Speaker 3>It was we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we associate ourselves or we try</v>

377
00:17:15.411 --> 00:17:19.500
<v Speaker 3>to think of ourselves as being some sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of an independent entity like I may as</v>

378
00:17:19.670 --> 00:17:21.410
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel good when I have a cup of coffee</v>

379
00:17:21.411 --> 00:17:25.430
<v Speaker 3>and a glass of orange juice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the idea that you literally are what</v>

380
00:17:25.431 --> 00:17:30.230
<v Speaker 3>you've put into your body and that it</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't just fuel your body,</v>

381
00:17:30.290 --> 00:17:35.290
<v Speaker 3>but it makes your body and your body</v>
<v Speaker 3>changes and varies dependent upon what</v>

382
00:17:35.661 --> 00:17:36.494
<v Speaker 3>you're putting in.</v>

383
00:17:36.510 --> 00:17:39.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're like a trillion organisms actually</v>

384
00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:43.350
<v Speaker 2>that just have one over mind so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything's not just warring with each</v>

385
00:17:43.351 --> 00:17:45.390
<v Speaker 2>other and and making it like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need this,</v>

386
00:17:45.391 --> 00:17:47.700
<v Speaker 2>I need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just have one over mine,</v>

387
00:17:47.701 --> 00:17:48.760
<v Speaker 2>but it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

388
00:17:48.830 --> 00:17:50.040
<v Speaker 2>we're king of a trillion</v>

389
00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:52.290
<v Speaker 1>cells and how are we going to be a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>ruler to these?</v>

390
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.380
<v Speaker 1>They're like our loyal subjects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we have a little kingdom in our</v>

391
00:17:55.381 --> 00:17:56.970
<v Speaker 1>body and are we going to be a good</v>
<v Speaker 1>ruler?</v>

392
00:17:57.150 --> 00:17:59.580
<v Speaker 1>Are we going to be a shitty one that</v>
<v Speaker 1>just talks shit to him?</v>

393
00:17:59.581 --> 00:18:01.320
<v Speaker 1>It gives him shit food and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

394
00:18:01.670 --> 00:18:03.600
<v Speaker 1>taxes the hell out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mass too much.</v>

395
00:18:03.601 --> 00:18:06.870
<v Speaker 1>Gives you little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well we have one voice where it comes</v>

396
00:18:06.871 --> 00:18:09.600
<v Speaker 1>out of one hole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't necessarily know.</v>

397
00:18:09.601 --> 00:18:12.150
<v Speaker 1>That's like one thing in there that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>running the show.</v>

398
00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.670
<v Speaker 1>That's true because I think we like to</v>
<v Speaker 1>think that it is,</v>

399
00:18:14.671 --> 00:18:18.420
<v Speaker 1>but God dammit shifts loyalty and</v>
<v Speaker 1>direction.</v>

400
00:18:18.421 --> 00:18:20.130
<v Speaker 1>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all over the place.</v>

401
00:18:20.131 --> 00:18:25.131
<v Speaker 1>The mind and who you know in quotes you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you think of yourself as me,</v>

402
00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:27.690
<v Speaker 1>you know me when you think when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

403
00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.760
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to do this or I'm going to do</v>

404
00:18:29.761 --> 00:18:29.970
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

405
00:18:29.970 --> 00:18:31.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you saying?</v>

406
00:18:31.650 --> 00:18:32.670
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are you saying?</v>

407
00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:34.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to lead the troops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who are you?</v>

408
00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.900
<v Speaker 1>You change all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>motherfucker.</v>

409
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:38.900
<v Speaker 1>You're different whether or not you've</v>
<v Speaker 1>had a nap,</v>

410
00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:41.850
<v Speaker 1>whether you've had a cup of coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you're taken your Alpha brain,</v>

411
00:18:41.851 --> 00:18:43.730
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking different all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

412
00:18:43.731 --> 00:18:44.564
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Bitch.</v>

413
00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:47.250
<v Speaker 1>You're so inconsistent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what's going on in there?</v>

414
00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:48.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on there as you're an</v>

415
00:18:48.721 --> 00:18:50.110
<v Speaker 1>ecosystem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

416
00:18:50.111 --> 00:18:52.950
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the jungle calling itself a</v>

417
00:18:52.951 --> 00:18:56.270
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The jungles not authoring the jungle is</v>

418
00:18:56.310 --> 00:19:01.310
<v Speaker 1>fucking millions of things all in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>cycle where the big ones are eating the</v>

419
00:19:01.381 --> 00:19:04.650
<v Speaker 1>little ones and then the big ones die</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the little ones absorb it and it's</v>

420
00:19:04.651 --> 00:19:08.130
<v Speaker 1>like this constant ever going thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's happening.</v>

421
00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:11.760
<v Speaker 1>The idea of it being like the like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lighter,</v>

422
00:19:11.970 --> 00:19:13.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or like a brick,</v>

423
00:19:13.410 --> 00:19:13.620
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

424
00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:18.620
<v Speaker 1>It's not a fucking giant system of all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these and that's the body.</v>

425
00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:19.710
<v Speaker 1>Very true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

426
00:19:19.711 --> 00:19:24.360
<v Speaker 1>I think there's this combination of also</v>
<v Speaker 1>the body and then consciousness and the</v>

427
00:19:24.361 --> 00:19:26.670
<v Speaker 1>mind like all of these three different</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

428
00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:28.510
<v Speaker 1>which I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how I kind of organize it.</v>

429
00:19:28.511 --> 00:19:30.060
<v Speaker 1>There's the body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there's the mind,</v>

430
00:19:30.061 --> 00:19:32.970
<v Speaker 1>ego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's your consciousness and</v>

431
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.270
<v Speaker 1>those are always different voices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The body's more like a plant.</v>

432
00:19:36.330 --> 00:19:39.150
<v Speaker 1>It's slow and it doesn't listen to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind that which moves,</v>

433
00:19:39.151 --> 00:19:41.970
<v Speaker 1>like instantly the mind can think one</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and the other thing,</v>

434
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.090
<v Speaker 1>but the body has fortunately has a big</v>
<v Speaker 1>lag.</v>

435
00:19:45.091 --> 00:19:46.200
<v Speaker 1>It's way slower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise,</v>

436
00:19:46.201 --> 00:19:48.000
<v Speaker 1>they'd be getting mixed signals all over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the place,</v>

437
00:19:48.001 --> 00:19:51.660
<v Speaker 1>so that inherently creates a conflict</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the mind moves at the speed of</v>

438
00:19:51.661 --> 00:19:53.610
<v Speaker 1>light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the body moves slow,</v>

439
00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:57.810
<v Speaker 1>so we have this built in system where</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a little bit strange like we can</v>

440
00:19:57.811 --> 00:20:00.690
<v Speaker 1>want something for the body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it takes a while.</v>

441
00:20:00.690 --> 00:20:03.570
<v Speaker 1>You gotta change the nutrients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to do these different things and</v>

442
00:20:03.571 --> 00:20:07.470
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a frustration point for</v>
<v Speaker 1>people with their bodies because their</v>

443
00:20:07.471 --> 00:20:11.220
<v Speaker 1>mind is so fast and that's what they</v>
<v Speaker 1>identify with and they want the body to</v>

444
00:20:11.221 --> 00:20:13.410
<v Speaker 1>react.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the body slow bodies like a plan.</v>

445
00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants that instant fix.</v>

446
00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:18.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you come off of hard drinking over</v>

447
00:20:18.661 --> 00:20:21.590
<v Speaker 1>new years and you look at your gut and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start pinching your fat and you're</v>

448
00:20:21.591 --> 00:20:22.620
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God damn it.</v>

449
00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:25.230
<v Speaker 1>I got to change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then it's hard.</v>

450
00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:27.630
<v Speaker 1>Like you wake up and you look at your</v>
<v Speaker 1>clock and like,</v>

451
00:20:27.631 --> 00:20:29.010
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to go to the gym.</v>

452
00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:31.800
<v Speaker 1>If I go to sleep right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could sleep for another hour and a</v>

453
00:20:31.801 --> 00:20:35.220
<v Speaker 1>half before I have to go to work or I go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the gym right now and you know what</v>

454
00:20:35.221 --> 00:20:37.830
<v Speaker 1>you should do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your body's like,</v>

455
00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:41.220
<v Speaker 1>come on man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then your brain is like,</v>

456
00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:43.650
<v Speaker 1>what are we looking for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're looking for success.</v>

457
00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:45.660
<v Speaker 1>We're looking to improve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're looking to feel good,</v>

458
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:47.930
<v Speaker 1>get up you fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's,</v>

459
00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:48.160
<v Speaker 1>it's</v>

460
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:53.160
<v Speaker 3>this conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Constant conflict of trying to improve</v>

461
00:20:53.441 --> 00:20:57.250
<v Speaker 3>and trying to be disciplined and trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get it all together.</v>

462
00:20:57.251 --> 00:21:01.600
<v Speaker 3>And then this fucking self sabotage</v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanism that somehow or another,</v>

463
00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:03.700
<v Speaker 3>the vast majority of us have.</v>

464
00:21:03.790 --> 00:21:06.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the inner bitch bitch.</v>

465
00:21:06.341 --> 00:21:07.300
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

466
00:21:07.301 --> 00:21:08.950
<v Speaker 2>I think one of the most important</v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

467
00:21:08.951 --> 00:21:11.380
<v Speaker 2>and this is what I've really been</v>
<v Speaker 2>focusing on,</v>

468
00:21:11.381 --> 00:21:14.740
<v Speaker 2>is having the ability to do what I call</v>
<v Speaker 2>mental override,</v>

469
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:20.110
<v Speaker 2>which is just where you just push</v>
<v Speaker 2>manually push that go button all the way</v>

470
00:21:20.111 --> 00:21:22.270
<v Speaker 2>down and just do something that you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

471
00:21:22.271 --> 00:21:25.780
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to do because we're so</v>
<v Speaker 2>good at negotiating and justifying and</v>

472
00:21:26.110 --> 00:21:27.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having these little arguments with</v>

473
00:21:27.611 --> 00:21:30.820
<v Speaker 2>ourselves and sometimes you just need</v>
<v Speaker 2>that ability to just go,</v>

474
00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:32.110
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're doing this.</v>

475
00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:34.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't care if you're scared,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's cool.</v>

476
00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:36.130
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mental override.</v>

477
00:21:36.131 --> 00:21:39.880
<v Speaker 2>We're doing this and you can really use</v>
<v Speaker 2>that ability to choose,</v>

478
00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in so many things.</v>

479
00:21:41.291 --> 00:21:43.810
<v Speaker 2>You can even choose yourself in a better</v>
<v Speaker 2>mood.</v>

480
00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.670
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've experimented with that like you're</v>

481
00:21:45.671 --> 00:21:47.800
<v Speaker 2>in a Shitty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a shitty mood and like,</v>

482
00:21:47.801 --> 00:21:52.330
<v Speaker 2>well maybe you just choose to listen to</v>
<v Speaker 2>a song that's not like a shitty mood</v>

483
00:21:52.331 --> 00:21:56.590
<v Speaker 2>song and then you choose to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can jump from Lily Pad to Lily Pad,</v>

484
00:21:56.591 --> 00:22:00.250
<v Speaker 2>but you can choose your way out of a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of different things if you're willing to</v>

485
00:22:00.251 --> 00:22:02.770
<v Speaker 2>do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have cultivated that skill to</v>

486
00:22:02.771 --> 00:22:05.110
<v Speaker 2>just push the hammer down and say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

487
00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:06.850
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to be happier right now.</v>

488
00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:12.470
<v Speaker 3>It's that determinism thing that a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of people fall prey to.</v>

489
00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:16.820
<v Speaker 3>It's like all the different</v>
<v Speaker 3>circumstances that have happened in your</v>

490
00:22:16.821 --> 00:22:20.660
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All of your own trials and tribulations,</v>

491
00:22:20.661 --> 00:22:25.400
<v Speaker 3>successes and failures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these things lead up to who you are</v>

492
00:22:25.401 --> 00:22:29.390
<v Speaker 3>right now and sometimes the momentum of</v>
<v Speaker 3>those things is super hard for people to</v>

493
00:22:29.391 --> 00:22:32.120
<v Speaker 3>break.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's super hard for if you've always got</v>

494
00:22:32.121 --> 00:22:34.880
<v Speaker 3>up in the morning and smoked a cigarette</v>
<v Speaker 3>and had a cup of coffee,</v>

495
00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:37.130
<v Speaker 3>the one day you get up and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

496
00:22:37.210 --> 00:22:39.930
<v Speaker 3>I gotTa stop doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to take care of my body.</v>

497
00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.280
<v Speaker 3>Got To get off the cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got to figure out a way to have it,</v>

498
00:22:43.370 --> 00:22:48.370
<v Speaker 3>but to to try to cultivate a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 3>different inspirational things to get</v>

499
00:22:51.441 --> 00:22:55.940
<v Speaker 3>you over that Hump I think is the way</v>
<v Speaker 3>like whether it's people like for me</v>

500
00:22:55.941 --> 00:22:59.030
<v Speaker 3>there's a bunch of people that I call</v>
<v Speaker 3>upon in my mind in my mind,</v>

501
00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:03.340
<v Speaker 3>like when I think of like a incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 3>disciplined top.</v>

502
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:06.440
<v Speaker 3>Like there's this guy that about on my</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcast before a great guy,</v>

503
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:10.100
<v Speaker 3>Jocko willink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jocko was fucking savage.</v>

504
00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:10.610
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

505
00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:13.220
<v Speaker 3>He's the man every morning go to the</v>
<v Speaker 3>twitter page.</v>

506
00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:17.900
<v Speaker 3>That motherfucker shows a photo of his</v>
<v Speaker 3>watch and it'll say 4:45 or 4:30 or</v>

507
00:23:17.901 --> 00:23:21.530
<v Speaker 3>4:15.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This fucker is up every day before five</v>

508
00:23:21.710 --> 00:23:25.580
<v Speaker 3>slinging lead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just fucking lifting weights and he,</v>

509
00:23:25.610 --> 00:23:29.270
<v Speaker 3>he'll show like puddles on the ground</v>
<v Speaker 3>after his workouts and then it'll show</v>

510
00:23:29.271 --> 00:23:33.830
<v Speaker 3>like the sun coming up and he feels like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that gives him an advantage.</v>

511
00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:37.700
<v Speaker 3>But in sending those images out there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>other people,</v>

512
00:23:37.701 --> 00:23:40.790
<v Speaker 3>even people like me that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't necessarily have a</v>

513
00:23:40.791 --> 00:23:44.300
<v Speaker 3>problem with discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a but I don't have the best</v>

514
00:23:44.301 --> 00:23:45.360
<v Speaker 3>discipline.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

515
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:46.150
<v Speaker 3>But I mean,</v>

516
00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:47.720
<v Speaker 1>but it's pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty good.</v>

517
00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:50.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty healthy but I'm still a fuck</v>

518
00:23:50.391 --> 00:23:53.710
<v Speaker 1>up on occasion because I'm a comedian at</v>
<v Speaker 1>heart.</v>

519
00:23:53.711 --> 00:23:57.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean ultimately is that self-indulgent</v>
<v Speaker 1>personality that goes,</v>

520
00:23:57.470 --> 00:23:58.720
<v Speaker 1>we're doing shots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

521
00:23:58.850 --> 00:24:00.470
<v Speaker 1>it's always there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

522
00:24:00.770 --> 00:24:05.000
<v Speaker 1>but when you see a guy like that that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>out there fucking going for it like</v>

523
00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:06.200
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys like that,</v>

524
00:24:06.201 --> 00:24:08.180
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they breed like a little spark,</v>

525
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:10.180
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not even a little spark,</v>

526
00:24:10.181 --> 00:24:12.890
<v Speaker 1>like a big spark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a few of those people that I</v>

527
00:24:12.891 --> 00:24:15.200
<v Speaker 1>follow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few people that I know,</v>

528
00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:19.050
<v Speaker 1>a few people that have watched their</v>
<v Speaker 1>documentaries or a folder their,</v>

529
00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:21.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their workout routines and you just,</v>

530
00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:24.680
<v Speaker 1>you just got to cultivate those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just sort of like,</v>

531
00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:28.400
<v Speaker 1>he cultivate information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can have a conversation with no</v>

532
00:24:28.401 --> 00:24:29.480
<v Speaker 1>data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>

533
00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:31.850
<v Speaker 1>you literally have nothing to talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

534
00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:34.850
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't experienced anything of</v>
<v Speaker 1>you haven't taken any information,</v>

535
00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:38.570
<v Speaker 1>will that information much like food is</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuel for your body,</v>

536
00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:43.840
<v Speaker 1>that information is fuel for your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for your personality and for the way you</v>

537
00:24:45.051 --> 00:24:49.160
<v Speaker 1>view the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like your overall projection or</v>

538
00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:53.420
<v Speaker 1>interpretation of the world itself is</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on how much data you take in,</v>

539
00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.660
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the reasons why it's so</v>
<v Speaker 1>important to surround yourself with good</v>

540
00:24:56.661 --> 00:24:57.310
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

541
00:24:57.310 --> 00:25:00.080
<v Speaker 1>Duh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean people generally move by one of</v>

542
00:25:00.081 --> 00:25:02.360
<v Speaker 1>two forces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inspiration or desperation.</v>

543
00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:05.850
<v Speaker 1>It's way better to get an get in early</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the inspiration tip,</v>

544
00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.580
<v Speaker 1>wait for desperation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It causing,</v>

545
00:25:07.610 --> 00:25:08.540
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a heart attack.</v>

546
00:25:08.541 --> 00:25:10.040
<v Speaker 1>That's why I changed my diet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Oh,</v>

547
00:25:10.041 --> 00:25:11.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now it's time,</v>

548
00:25:11.811 --> 00:25:15.050
<v Speaker 1>but if you can move from inspiration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you're going to be way,</v>

549
00:25:15.051 --> 00:25:17.390
<v Speaker 1>but way better off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's something else too,</v>

550
00:25:17.391 --> 00:25:22.130
<v Speaker 1>which is just the ethos like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all warrior cultures develop this.</v>

551
00:25:22.130 --> 00:25:26.210
<v Speaker 1>The Samurai had the Bushido,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the spartans had their ethos and it's</v>

552
00:25:26.211 --> 00:25:29.750
<v Speaker 1>something where you just decide</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that just doesn't have.</v>

553
00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:34.250
<v Speaker 1>There's no room for negotiation anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not a negotiable item.</v>

554
00:25:34.251 --> 00:25:36.800
<v Speaker 1>You don't need inspiration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't need desperation because it's</v>

555
00:25:36.801 --> 00:25:41.420
<v Speaker 1>no longer on the table for negotiation</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think that's part of that ability</v>

556
00:25:41.421 --> 00:25:44.270
<v Speaker 1>to just choose something and create your</v>
<v Speaker 1>own ethos.</v>

557
00:25:44.271 --> 00:25:48.650
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe your ethos is I don't smoke</v>
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes anymore and that is my ethos.</v>

558
00:25:48.651 --> 00:25:53.310
<v Speaker 1>It is non negotiable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that is part of my code and</v>

559
00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:56.990
<v Speaker 1>developing something that's so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so strong that it's not even on the</v>

560
00:25:56.991 --> 00:25:58.800
<v Speaker 1>table for negotiation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

561
00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:03.110
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's important to use all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>those different facets.</v>

562
00:26:03.111 --> 00:26:04.840
<v Speaker 1>Like for the spartans it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

563
00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:08.120
<v Speaker 1>never retreat for the Samurai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was always keep on or you know,</v>

564
00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:11.090
<v Speaker 1>whatever their Bushido it was pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>wide code,</v>

565
00:26:11.091 --> 00:26:13.220
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of those things,</v>

566
00:26:13.221 --> 00:26:16.010
<v Speaker 1>there were these just these things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't break.</v>

567
00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:17.990
<v Speaker 1>So when it came time to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

568
00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.590
<v Speaker 1>take the sword to protect your honor</v>
<v Speaker 1>into your own gut.</v>

569
00:26:21.591 --> 00:26:22.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how hard that is.</v>

570
00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:25.600
<v Speaker 1>I can't even cut my little finger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cut my finger.</v>

571
00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:28.970
<v Speaker 1>You mentioned like sticking a sword,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was just non negotiable.</v>

572
00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:33.620
<v Speaker 1>Like it was so deeply ingrained and so I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think all of us should spend time</v>

573
00:26:33.621 --> 00:26:36.440
<v Speaker 1>creating our own ethos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what is our ethos?</v>

574
00:26:36.441 --> 00:26:39.530
<v Speaker 1>And don't get too crazy with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm never going to eat sugar.</v>

575
00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:40.550
<v Speaker 1>Come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

576
00:26:40.551 --> 00:26:42.380
<v Speaker 1>give yourself a little bit of sugar</v>
<v Speaker 1>every now and then.</v>

577
00:26:42.381 --> 00:26:43.860
<v Speaker 1>Don't make that ethos</v>

578
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:46.170
<v Speaker 2>but create something that's just non</v>
<v Speaker 2>negotiable.</v>

579
00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.870
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think cheat days are really good for</v>

580
00:26:48.871 --> 00:26:52.170
<v Speaker 3>the mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cheat meals are really good for the mind</v>

581
00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:57.540
<v Speaker 3>and that even though it's not good to</v>
<v Speaker 3>take in like an entire pizza in one</v>

582
00:26:57.661 --> 00:27:00.810
<v Speaker 3>setting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>knowing that you allow yourself that</v>

583
00:27:00.811 --> 00:27:05.811
<v Speaker 3>possibility every now and then actually</v>
<v Speaker 3>relaxes the imagination and relaxes the,</v>

584
00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:10.590
<v Speaker 3>the resistance to discipline because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel,</v>

585
00:27:10.591 --> 00:27:13.410
<v Speaker 3>at least me personally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't like rules.</v>

586
00:27:13.650 --> 00:27:16.530
<v Speaker 3>I don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean one of the reasons why I became</v>

587
00:27:16.531 --> 00:27:20.880
<v Speaker 3>who I am and the path that I chose as</v>
<v Speaker 3>far as like what I chose to do in life</v>

588
00:27:21.450 --> 00:27:24.900
<v Speaker 3>just because I didn't like people</v>
<v Speaker 3>telling me what to do.</v>

589
00:27:24.901 --> 00:27:28.800
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like the idea of school.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't like them telling me I had to</v>

590
00:27:28.801 --> 00:27:33.801
<v Speaker 3>learn this right now for whatever dumb</v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons and when you grow up with this</v>

591
00:27:34.921 --> 00:27:39.921
<v Speaker 3>idea that confirm conforming is bad and</v>
<v Speaker 3>that following orders makes you a robot</v>

592
00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:42.450
<v Speaker 3>and a slave.</v>

593
00:27:42.480 --> 00:27:44.430
<v Speaker 3>Fuck that man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to be my own person will be a</v>

594
00:27:44.431 --> 00:27:47.490
<v Speaker 3>free spirit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to put tie dye on fucking</v>

595
00:27:47.491 --> 00:27:50.460
<v Speaker 3>hitchhike across the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here you have these ideas that the,</v>

596
00:27:50.890 --> 00:27:53.610
<v Speaker 3>the sort of patterns that everybody else</v>
<v Speaker 3>is following,</v>

597
00:27:53.611 --> 00:27:56.550
<v Speaker 3>they're only following them because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've been told to and you don't have</v>

598
00:27:56.551 --> 00:27:57.241
<v Speaker 3>to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

599
00:27:57.241 --> 00:27:59.400
<v Speaker 3>It's bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're all just organisms.</v>

600
00:27:59.401 --> 00:28:00.780
<v Speaker 3>We're all just living on this life</v>
<v Speaker 3>together.</v>

601
00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:04.260
<v Speaker 3>So you kinda get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get into this mindset where you don't</v>

602
00:28:04.261 --> 00:28:07.950
<v Speaker 3>want to have any rigidity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to have any,</v>

603
00:28:08.030 --> 00:28:09.600
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any hard fast rules,</v>

604
00:28:09.601 --> 00:28:13.680
<v Speaker 3>but that's not necessarily empowering to</v>
<v Speaker 3>you as an individual.</v>

605
00:28:13.950 --> 00:28:17.970
<v Speaker 3>One of the things I'm really fond of</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying is that you only appreciate rest</v>

606
00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:19.340
<v Speaker 3>when you've earned it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

607
00:28:19.350 --> 00:28:22.390
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't appreciate rest unless I've</v>

608
00:28:22.391 --> 00:28:25.980
<v Speaker 3>fucking busted my ass and those have</v>
<v Speaker 3>worked out hard.</v>

609
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:27.860
<v Speaker 3>Got All my work done,</v>
<v Speaker 3>got all my shit,</v>

610
00:28:27.861 --> 00:28:30.210
<v Speaker 3>all my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I have anything that's fucking with</v>

611
00:28:30.211 --> 00:28:31.530
<v Speaker 3>me in the back of my head,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

612
00:28:31.690 --> 00:28:33.100
<v Speaker 3>it haunts me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

613
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:35.580
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it bothers me and I can appreciate</v>

614
00:28:35.730 --> 00:28:38.070
<v Speaker 3>relaxation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does not worth anything anymore.</v>

615
00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:41.700
<v Speaker 3>If I come home from doing nothing and I</v>
<v Speaker 3>sit down in front of the television,</v>

616
00:28:41.701 --> 00:28:45.600
<v Speaker 3>I may enjoy whatever I'm watching.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might enjoy it because it's good</v>

617
00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:50.130
<v Speaker 3>information or it's good stimulation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not going to enjoy that</v>

618
00:28:50.131 --> 00:28:51.680
<v Speaker 3>relaxation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not gonna.</v>

619
00:28:51.700 --> 00:28:53.760
<v Speaker 3>Enjoy that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That thing and I've earned it.</v>

620
00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:57.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you have a natural seeking of</v>

621
00:28:57.241 --> 00:29:00.870
<v Speaker 2>your own kind of balance and I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what's important is having that</v>

622
00:29:00.871 --> 00:29:02.910
<v Speaker 2>compass to say like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>

623
00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.200
<v Speaker 2>I've worked this hard and now it's time</v>
<v Speaker 2>to take off and just let the stress go</v>

624
00:29:07.201 --> 00:29:10.500
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's an important line of</v>
<v Speaker 2>delineation something that I struggle</v>

625
00:29:10.501 --> 00:29:14.010
<v Speaker 2>with too because I'll finish a long day</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the office and they'll come back and</v>

626
00:29:14.011 --> 00:29:17.400
<v Speaker 2>I'll work and I'll be constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even when I'm like with Whitney trying</v>

627
00:29:17.401 --> 00:29:20.130
<v Speaker 2>to watch a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm thinking about what I could be doing</v>

628
00:29:20.131 --> 00:29:21.840
<v Speaker 2>instead of just saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right man,</v>

629
00:29:21.841 --> 00:29:23.390
<v Speaker 2>just take this two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

630
00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.170
<v Speaker 2>really rest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're off.</v>

631
00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.530
<v Speaker 2>You're off duty man and clock out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's an important thing to</v>

632
00:29:28.531 --> 00:29:32.400
<v Speaker 2>kind of restore and yet again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's that same thing like taking a</v>

633
00:29:32.401 --> 00:29:34.860
<v Speaker 2>break,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like allow yourself that opportunity to</v>

634
00:29:34.861 --> 00:29:36.670
<v Speaker 2>let the stress go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

635
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:39.660
<v Speaker 2>when you've done the work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you're on the other side and</v>

636
00:29:39.661 --> 00:29:42.010
<v Speaker 2>you're just not really doing anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

637
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.670
<v Speaker 1>and you're just kind of relaxing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's starting to create the stress,</v>

638
00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:49.660
<v Speaker 1>then you got to go to the other side of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pendulum and kick some serious ass</v>

639
00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:52.450
<v Speaker 1>first before you start worrying about</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest.</v>

640
00:29:52.451 --> 00:29:55.690
<v Speaker 1>So it's just about like striking that</v>
<v Speaker 1>right balance in your life.</v>

641
00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:56.890
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's so important.</v>

642
00:29:56.891 --> 00:30:00.010
<v Speaker 1>The right balance of so God damn</v>
<v Speaker 1>important because you don't want to be</v>

643
00:30:00.011 --> 00:30:03.970
<v Speaker 1>that fucking psychopath that just burns</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything in front of you and just</v>

644
00:30:03.971 --> 00:30:07.540
<v Speaker 1>hacks at the land trying to achieve</v>
<v Speaker 1>victory because that,</v>

645
00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:11.620
<v Speaker 1>unless you're a fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that if you're competing,</v>

646
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:13.030
<v Speaker 1>if you're fighting like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

647
00:30:13.031 --> 00:30:17.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big fan of saying that if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to fight,</v>

648
00:30:17.290 --> 00:30:20.800
<v Speaker 1>if this is what you want to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to be completely singular pursuit</v>

649
00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:21.813
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

650
00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:25.000
<v Speaker 1>I want to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I also want to open up an organic</v>

651
00:30:25.090 --> 00:30:30.090
<v Speaker 1>peach jam business and I know what I</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean and I also want to start marathon</v>

652
00:30:31.001 --> 00:30:35.230
<v Speaker 1>running and I'm also really involved in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this and that and that and this man,</v>

653
00:30:35.231 --> 00:30:39.910
<v Speaker 1>if you want to be someone who's doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>something so insanely dangerous that</v>

654
00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:45.150
<v Speaker 1>it's probably as far as pursuits in</v>
<v Speaker 1>sport fighting is probably one of the</v>

655
00:30:46.391 --> 00:30:51.100
<v Speaker 1>all time most dangerous things you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly do other than like maybe bmx,</v>

656
00:30:51.190 --> 00:30:55.810
<v Speaker 1>flying those flips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those guys do have ramps and like ski</v>

657
00:30:55.811 --> 00:30:58.570
<v Speaker 1>jumping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the shit that he does when he's</v>

658
00:30:58.571 --> 00:30:59.830
<v Speaker 1>fucking flying down a hill.</v>

659
00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:02.110
<v Speaker 1>Like Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that's insanely dangerous too.</v>

660
00:31:02.111 --> 00:31:05.960
<v Speaker 1>But like a singular pursuit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

661
00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:08.170
<v Speaker 1>I think you can only do it for a few</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

662
00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.170
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe at the most 10 or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

663
00:31:11.171 --> 00:31:14.620
<v Speaker 1>But I think to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be like a fade or a million inco in</v>

664
00:31:14.621 --> 00:31:17.830
<v Speaker 1>his prime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that motherfucker was probably gone.</v>

665
00:31:18.130 --> 00:31:22.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean he was probably in that zone all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time,</v>

666
00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:26.230
<v Speaker 1>like Anderson when he was in his prime</v>
<v Speaker 1>other than pussy and food.</v>

667
00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:29.170
<v Speaker 1>I bet that dude was pretty locked in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

668
00:31:29.171 --> 00:31:31.480
<v Speaker 1>in the few recreational activities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>video games,</v>

669
00:31:31.481 --> 00:31:35.770
<v Speaker 1>what have you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you need to achieve that state of</v>

670
00:31:35.771 --> 00:31:40.540
<v Speaker 1>like high revolution excellence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You almost have to be like unhealthy.</v>

671
00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:43.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I talked to a really successful</v>

672
00:31:43.391 --> 00:31:46.750
<v Speaker 1>person that I know and he said that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>limits himself always two,</v>

673
00:31:46.751 --> 00:31:49.600
<v Speaker 1>three things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he will not allow himself to focus</v>

674
00:31:49.601 --> 00:31:53.110
<v Speaker 1>on anything more than three things and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was kind of interesting for me</v>

675
00:31:53.111 --> 00:31:56.560
<v Speaker 1>because I love creating these little</v>
<v Speaker 1>different things and working on these</v>

676
00:31:56.561 --> 00:31:57.310
<v Speaker 1>different projects.</v>

677
00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:58.510
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

678
00:31:58.570 --> 00:32:02.770
<v Speaker 1>three things is the maximum and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I forceably cut myself off with and</v>

679
00:32:02.771 --> 00:32:04.930
<v Speaker 1>I think that's something good to keep in</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind.</v>

680
00:32:04.931 --> 00:32:08.830
<v Speaker 1>You can only really genuinely work on</v>
<v Speaker 1>three things at a time and maybe when</v>

681
00:32:08.831 --> 00:32:12.520
<v Speaker 1>you're a fighter that just narrows down</v>
<v Speaker 1>even more to just one thing.</v>

682
00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:13.870
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you have those disciplines</v>

683
00:32:13.871 --> 00:32:15.310
<v Speaker 1>you're working on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're working on the grappling,</v>

684
00:32:15.311 --> 00:32:17.440
<v Speaker 1>discipline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>striking disciplines and maybe those are</v>

685
00:32:17.441 --> 00:32:18.460
<v Speaker 1>your three things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wrestling,</v>

686
00:32:18.461 --> 00:32:19.840
<v Speaker 1>striking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not like nuts.</v>

687
00:32:20.050 --> 00:32:21.700
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all you have time for.</v>

688
00:32:21.701 --> 00:32:24.310
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to be the greatest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe that's why Thailand so good for</v>

689
00:32:24.311 --> 00:32:26.830
<v Speaker 1>those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just you just pay for sex.</v>

690
00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:30.820
<v Speaker 1>You just take that off the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not even an issue.</v>

691
00:32:30.821 --> 00:32:32.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just go to the massage parlor or</v>

692
00:32:32.681 --> 00:32:35.200
<v Speaker 1>whatever you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get your joint worked out.</v>

693
00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:36.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no doubt.</v>

694
00:32:36.250 --> 00:32:37.083
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

695
00:32:37.210 --> 00:32:38.043
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

696
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:39.783
<v Speaker 1>where</v>

697
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:44.900
<v Speaker 3>everybody's sort of trying to find this</v>
<v Speaker 3>zone that makes them feel the best,</v>

698
00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:47.900
<v Speaker 3>that makes them feel the most satisfied,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most comfortable,</v>

699
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:51.260
<v Speaker 3>the least crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the least disappointed.</v>

700
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:54.830
<v Speaker 3>You just want to find this and</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's zone is different.</v>

701
00:32:55.010 --> 00:32:58.370
<v Speaker 3>Like some people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't have this and burning</v>

702
00:32:58.371 --> 00:33:01.580
<v Speaker 3>ambition to succeed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't have lofty goals,</v>

703
00:33:01.790 --> 00:33:06.550
<v Speaker 3>they just want to be happy or they want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to pursue whatever are in they enjoyed</v>

704
00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.870
<v Speaker 3>doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it's maybe like painting or</v>

705
00:33:08.871 --> 00:33:12.140
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just enjoy creating painting,</v>

706
00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>creating a piece of art that someone's</v>

707
00:33:14.541 --> 00:33:16.040
<v Speaker 3>going to look at and it looks kind of</v>
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>

708
00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:20.900
<v Speaker 3>I think that's really important to not</v>
<v Speaker 3>take what societies when is and make it</v>

709
00:33:20.901 --> 00:33:23.840
<v Speaker 3>your own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have your very own wind and that</v>

710
00:33:23.841 --> 00:33:27.560
<v Speaker 3>could be chilling at the beach surfing</v>
<v Speaker 3>and occasionally painting and that's</v>

711
00:33:27.561 --> 00:33:29.930
<v Speaker 3>your win and if somebody else is trying</v>
<v Speaker 3>to tell you,</v>

712
00:33:29.931 --> 00:33:31.370
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to do something with your life,</v>

713
00:33:31.371 --> 00:33:31.910
<v Speaker 3>fuck that.</v>

714
00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:34.730
<v Speaker 3>That's just a counter force,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you really track what your</v>

715
00:33:34.731 --> 00:33:39.500
<v Speaker 3>mission is and what you love to do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then do that thing you know and don't</v>

716
00:33:39.501 --> 00:33:43.490
<v Speaker 3>let these other things tell you that</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not succeeding or try and make</v>

717
00:33:43.491 --> 00:33:48.080
<v Speaker 3>you conform to what society says is</v>
<v Speaker 3>success because that's a bunch of</v>

718
00:33:48.081 --> 00:33:50.690
<v Speaker 3>bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We each have our own version of that and</v>

719
00:33:50.691 --> 00:33:53.360
<v Speaker 3>I think it's the most important thing we</v>
<v Speaker 3>can do to stay true to that,</v>

720
00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:56.840
<v Speaker 3>but it does seem to me that everybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>needs something.</v>

721
00:33:57.250 --> 00:33:58.640
<v Speaker 3>We were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sure,</v>

722
00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:01.250
<v Speaker 3>whatever those things are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These interests that people have,</v>

723
00:34:01.251 --> 00:34:03.620
<v Speaker 3>they seem to be like vehicles for</v>
<v Speaker 3>happiness,</v>

724
00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:08.390
<v Speaker 3>like the mind almost from being</v>
<v Speaker 3>developed at the time we were monkeys to</v>

725
00:34:08.391 --> 00:34:11.000
<v Speaker 3>what we are now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The mind has gone through all these</v>

726
00:34:11.001 --> 00:34:13.970
<v Speaker 3>different activities and has gone</v>
<v Speaker 3>through all these trials and</v>

727
00:34:13.971 --> 00:34:16.250
<v Speaker 3>tribulations and the struggles for</v>
<v Speaker 3>survival.</v>

728
00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:20.090
<v Speaker 3>So there's almost like this built in</v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanism in the mind to problem solve</v>

729
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:23.810
<v Speaker 3>and to deal with things and either to</v>
<v Speaker 3>create like for a lot of people that's a</v>

730
00:34:23.811 --> 00:34:28.790
<v Speaker 3>big one or to achieve or to accomplish</v>
<v Speaker 3>or to get over the hump and when you're</v>

731
00:34:28.791 --> 00:34:31.280
<v Speaker 3>not fighting for your life and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>not struggling,</v>

732
00:34:31.490 --> 00:34:34.640
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those don't get fed and these sort of</v>

733
00:34:34.641 --> 00:34:39.641
<v Speaker 3>genetically ingrained reward systems,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they seem to be like built into the</v>

734
00:34:40.611 --> 00:34:43.550
<v Speaker 3>system of being a person they don't get</v>
<v Speaker 3>addressed.</v>

735
00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:47.240
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's one of the reasons</v>
<v Speaker 3>why a lot of people feel lost.</v>

736
00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:52.670
<v Speaker 3>They feel they feel like depressed and</v>
<v Speaker 3>unsatisfied because what they're</v>

737
00:34:52.671 --> 00:34:55.490
<v Speaker 3>choosing to pursue is not really</v>
<v Speaker 3>interesting to them.</v>

738
00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:58.960
<v Speaker 3>Like there was a threat on my message</v>
<v Speaker 3>board where someone was,</v>

739
00:34:58.961 --> 00:34:59.301
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

740
00:34:59.301 --> 00:35:01.370
<v Speaker 3>it became like a big crazy fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>argument,</v>

741
00:35:01.371 --> 00:35:03.050
<v Speaker 3>like all threads and all message boards</v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

742
00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:06.950
<v Speaker 3>But it started off interesting where</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone was saying that hard work stupid</v>

743
00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:11.300
<v Speaker 3>and that really what you want to do is</v>
<v Speaker 3>find something you love and then</v>

744
00:35:11.301 --> 00:35:14.090
<v Speaker 3>disciplines no longer required because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're truly enjoy it.</v>

745
00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.430
<v Speaker 3>Which is sort of true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But sort of not,</v>

746
00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:19.460
<v Speaker 3>because if you really want to achieve</v>
<v Speaker 3>excellence,</v>

747
00:35:19.461 --> 00:35:21.980
<v Speaker 3>you need both.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You need to find something you really</v>

748
00:35:21.981 --> 00:35:24.650
<v Speaker 3>love doing and then you need to figure</v>
<v Speaker 3>out how to discipline yourself to pursue</v>

749
00:35:24.651 --> 00:35:29.600
<v Speaker 3>it to the utmost so that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you hone that blade and sharpen it to</v>

750
00:35:29.601 --> 00:35:32.780
<v Speaker 3>it's razor edge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you do not do that,</v>

751
00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:34.340
<v Speaker 3>then you're always going to have this</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing like,</v>

752
00:35:34.370 --> 00:35:36.380
<v Speaker 3>oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could have been better.</v>

753
00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:38.580
<v Speaker 3>We need resistance.</v>

754
00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:40.500
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need resistance in our life.</v>

755
00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:44.040
<v Speaker 1>Like the obstacle is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is what we should go towards.</v>

756
00:35:44.041 --> 00:35:46.020
<v Speaker 1>No matter what that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether we're writing,</v>

757
00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:48.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>writing itself contains its own</v>

758
00:35:48.301 --> 00:35:51.420
<v Speaker 1>resistance points where it's hard and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're pushing against that.</v>

759
00:35:51.421 --> 00:35:53.640
<v Speaker 1>Obviously in weight training or</v>
<v Speaker 1>athletics,</v>

760
00:35:53.641 --> 00:35:56.760
<v Speaker 1>it becomes really obvious what that</v>
<v Speaker 1>resistance point is.</v>

761
00:35:56.761 --> 00:35:58.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're actually moving weight or trying</v>

762
00:35:58.921 --> 00:36:02.610
<v Speaker 1>to defeat a person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no matter what that is like applying</v>

763
00:36:02.611 --> 00:36:05.220
<v Speaker 1>our force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the force that is the totality of</v>

764
00:36:05.221 --> 00:36:08.940
<v Speaker 1>ourselves against a resisting force and</v>
<v Speaker 1>overcoming.</v>

765
00:36:08.941 --> 00:36:12.210
<v Speaker 1>I think that's a fundamental craving of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the human nature.</v>

766
00:36:12.211 --> 00:36:14.580
<v Speaker 1>Like that is definitely a key to</v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness.</v>

767
00:36:14.581 --> 00:36:17.220
<v Speaker 1>Whether it's against nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>against yourself,</v>

768
00:36:17.221 --> 00:36:19.170
<v Speaker 1>against a craft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>against another opponent,</v>

769
00:36:19.171 --> 00:36:22.260
<v Speaker 1>against whatever else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that dynamic,</v>

770
00:36:22.261 --> 00:36:25.230
<v Speaker 1>that push poll is super key.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

771
00:36:25.231 --> 00:36:29.250
<v Speaker 1>it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think unfortunately for whatever</v>

772
00:36:29.251 --> 00:36:31.620
<v Speaker 1>reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I,</v>

773
00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:36.680
<v Speaker 1>at least when I look at life itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I almost think that the evil of the,</v>

774
00:36:37.050 --> 00:36:39.750
<v Speaker 1>it seems like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the struggle of the world,</v>

775
00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:42.900
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a struggle for peace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a struggle for,</v>

776
00:36:43.170 --> 00:36:47.640
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to alleviate people that are trapped in</v>

777
00:36:47.641 --> 00:36:48.840
<v Speaker 1>poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

778
00:36:48.841 --> 00:36:50.640
<v Speaker 1>whatever struggle there is.</v>

779
00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:53.520
<v Speaker 1>It seems like those struggles are</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost,</v>

780
00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:58.890
<v Speaker 1>it's almost imperative to have some sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a struggle in order for people to</v>

781
00:36:58.891 --> 00:37:03.891
<v Speaker 1>find balance and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to find inspiration to do better and</v>

782
00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:05.970
<v Speaker 1>inspiration to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to push further.</v>

783
00:37:05.971 --> 00:37:10.320
<v Speaker 1>Like I wonder where society would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is kind of sound fucked up,</v>

784
00:37:10.321 --> 00:37:15.321
<v Speaker 1>but where would we be as a culture if it</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't for the horrors of war and crime?</v>

785
00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.410
<v Speaker 1>Like where would we be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got,</v>

786
00:37:18.450 --> 00:37:21.450
<v Speaker 1>as I was driving here today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about,</v>

787
00:37:21.451 --> 00:37:22.460
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

788
00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:28.100
<v Speaker 1>just how fortunate people are in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States in general are most people</v>

789
00:37:28.201 --> 00:37:31.200
<v Speaker 1>are at least,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that there's parts of the world</v>

790
00:37:31.201 --> 00:37:36.201
<v Speaker 1>right now that are in these horrific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost mad max states like Liberia.</v>

791
00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:42.100
<v Speaker 1>I've watched this one documentary on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>vice on Liberia that back in the day</v>

792
00:37:43.020 --> 00:37:47.910
<v Speaker 1>that just cemented in my mind how</v>
<v Speaker 1>fortunate we are because mad max like</v>

793
00:37:47.911 --> 00:37:49.540
<v Speaker 1>the apocalypse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it exists,</v>

794
00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:51.360
<v Speaker 1>it happens every day.</v>

795
00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:55.530
<v Speaker 1>Just doesn't happen right here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Knowing that that exists,</v>

796
00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:58.680
<v Speaker 1>does that make you appreciate this more?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if,</v>

797
00:37:58.770 --> 00:38:02.670
<v Speaker 1>if that didn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would we,</v>

798
00:38:02.910 --> 00:38:07.350
<v Speaker 1>would we try as hard as we do to try to</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep peace in the world?</v>

799
00:38:07.530 --> 00:38:12.530
<v Speaker 1>Would we try as hard as we do to like</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to be happy and achieve happiness if</v>

800
00:38:13.891 --> 00:38:18.090
<v Speaker 1>we didn't know that there was some</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate horrible sadness and evil shit</v>

801
00:38:18.091 --> 00:38:20.160
<v Speaker 1>going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you appreciate the cool people in</v>

802
00:38:20.161 --> 00:38:24.510
<v Speaker 1>your life if you didn't know that there</v>
<v Speaker 1>was just an army of content out there?</v>

803
00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:25.960
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

804
00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:29.280
<v Speaker 1>That's an interesting topic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of tend to believe that there's</v>

805
00:38:29.281 --> 00:38:33.450
<v Speaker 1>enough internal resistance that will</v>
<v Speaker 1>battle enough of our own demons.</v>

806
00:38:33.451 --> 00:38:36.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean look at how you celebrities</v>

807
00:38:36.370 --> 00:38:39.160
<v Speaker 2>and really wealthy people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their rate of happiness is no better</v>

808
00:38:39.161 --> 00:38:43.090
<v Speaker 2>than anybody else because even when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>alleviate all of these conditions,</v>

809
00:38:43.420 --> 00:38:47.650
<v Speaker 2>you're battling these internal demons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like will always find resistance points.</v>

810
00:38:47.651 --> 00:38:51.250
<v Speaker 2>So I think we would be okay because it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the way the system is built,</v>

811
00:38:51.251 --> 00:38:54.610
<v Speaker 2>they would come up internally when</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything is right and then we have to</v>

812
00:38:54.611 --> 00:38:59.410
<v Speaker 2>apply that same force to fight that</v>
<v Speaker 2>enemy within our own demons within</v>

813
00:38:59.411 --> 00:39:02.050
<v Speaker 2>rather than having this clear objective</v>
<v Speaker 2>outside.</v>

814
00:39:02.051 --> 00:39:04.690
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost easier and it's almost like</v>

815
00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:07.840
<v Speaker 2>it has a certain allure to make an enemy</v>
<v Speaker 2>external.</v>

816
00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.520
<v Speaker 2>Because then like imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

817
00:39:09.521 --> 00:39:12.460
<v Speaker 2>think back to when the twin towers got</v>
<v Speaker 2>bombed.</v>

818
00:39:12.490 --> 00:39:14.830
<v Speaker 2>Everybody pulled together with this</v>
<v Speaker 2>common enemy.</v>

819
00:39:14.831 --> 00:39:16.320
<v Speaker 2>We all had a mission,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

820
00:39:16.390 --> 00:39:20.170
<v Speaker 2>and everything made sense and that was a</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good external,</v>

821
00:39:20.490 --> 00:39:22.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>external way to focus our mission.</v>

822
00:39:23.140 --> 00:39:26.890
<v Speaker 2>But when it gets internal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's where we just don't have as many</v>

823
00:39:26.891 --> 00:39:28.930
<v Speaker 2>skills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's where the tools,</v>

824
00:39:28.931 --> 00:39:32.230
<v Speaker 2>like the plant medicines and like</v>
<v Speaker 2>meditation and like floating or the</v>

825
00:39:32.231 --> 00:39:35.020
<v Speaker 2>tools you need to navigate and kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>conquer those waters.</v>

826
00:39:35.021 --> 00:39:37.480
<v Speaker 2>It's not guns and it's not bombs</v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore,</v>

827
00:39:37.481 --> 00:39:42.481
<v Speaker 2>it's these other more subtle mechanisms</v>
<v Speaker 2>which were not nearly as advanced as we</v>

828
00:39:42.581 --> 00:39:46.390
<v Speaker 2>are with the stuff that blows stuff up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think it would just go from these</v>

829
00:39:46.391 --> 00:39:49.000
<v Speaker 2>external battles which have always had</v>
<v Speaker 2>this great allure.</v>

830
00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:50.810
<v Speaker 2>Let's go to war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

831
00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:54.730
<v Speaker 2>into these internal battles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are really actually a lot of times</v>

832
00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:56.170
<v Speaker 2>even harder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

833
00:39:56.171 --> 00:40:00.010
<v Speaker 2>not to say that these conditions in war</v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't incredibly challenging and</v>

834
00:40:00.011 --> 00:40:01.750
<v Speaker 2>incredibly difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

835
00:40:01.751 --> 00:40:05.590
<v Speaker 2>I've heard stories from Tim Kennedy and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of soldiers and just blow your</v>

836
00:40:05.591 --> 00:40:08.410
<v Speaker 2>mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but these internal battles can be super</v>

837
00:40:08.411 --> 00:40:09.460
<v Speaker 2>fucking intense too.</v>

838
00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:10.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just don't think of it as being</v>

839
00:40:11.030 --> 00:40:13.970
<v Speaker 3>intense because there's no life or death</v>
<v Speaker 3>consequences.</v>

840
00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:17.960
<v Speaker 3>The consequences are there are</v>
<v Speaker 3>psychological there.</v>

841
00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:22.340
<v Speaker 3>The reality of who you are as opposed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>this image that you're projecting,</v>

842
00:40:22.370 --> 00:40:27.370
<v Speaker 3>the reality to seeing all the sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>failures and,</v>

843
00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:31.080
<v Speaker 3>and all the different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

844
00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:35.750
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sort of mechanisms that you've created</v>

845
00:40:35.751 --> 00:40:37.280
<v Speaker 3>in your mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in your,</v>

846
00:40:37.281 --> 00:40:42.080
<v Speaker 3>in your life to deal with all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>personality issues that you might not</v>

847
00:40:42.081 --> 00:40:45.260
<v Speaker 3>have ever addressed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then when you take a psychedelic and</v>

848
00:40:45.261 --> 00:40:48.170
<v Speaker 3>you're confronted by this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Ari was telling me about one of his</v>

849
00:40:48.171 --> 00:40:51.620
<v Speaker 3>friends that was a dick and they took</v>
<v Speaker 3>him out to,</v>

850
00:40:51.621 --> 00:40:52.010
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

851
00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:56.090
<v Speaker 3>already does that true and fest every</v>
<v Speaker 3>year it took him out to the desert and</v>

852
00:40:56.120 --> 00:41:00.470
<v Speaker 3>he just had this literal come to Jesus</v>
<v Speaker 3>moment where it was like,</v>

853
00:41:00.471 --> 00:41:01.730
<v Speaker 3>why do I act like that?</v>

854
00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:03.140
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is wrong with me?</v>

855
00:41:03.141 --> 00:41:03.860
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

856
00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:07.430
<v Speaker 3>what is the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then he realized he's just unhappy</v>

857
00:41:07.431 --> 00:41:11.330
<v Speaker 3>with his life in his state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wake up where he is as far as his</v>

858
00:41:11.331 --> 00:41:14.840
<v Speaker 3>achievements as a standup comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as a,</v>

859
00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:16.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he's not successful.</v>

860
00:41:16.231 --> 00:41:17.460
<v Speaker 3>At least he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

861
00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:19.940
<v Speaker 3>he's always struggling with his bills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And because of that,</v>

862
00:41:20.210 --> 00:41:22.730
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's nervous all the time.</v>

863
00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:26.510
<v Speaker 3>So when he goes on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't do well and because he's not</v>

864
00:41:26.511 --> 00:41:28.970
<v Speaker 3>happy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't have good relationships and</v>

865
00:41:28.971 --> 00:41:30.500
<v Speaker 3>because he doesn't have good</v>
<v Speaker 3>relationships,</v>

866
00:41:30.501 --> 00:41:33.620
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't feel good about himself</v>
<v Speaker 3>because other people don't feel good him</v>

867
00:41:33.890 --> 00:41:38.810
<v Speaker 3>and he acts out almost in a defensive</v>
<v Speaker 3>mechanism like attacks people and acts</v>

868
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:43.870
<v Speaker 3>Shitty to people in almost a way of sort</v>
<v Speaker 3>of taking away focus from his own</v>

869
00:41:45.861 --> 00:41:49.970
<v Speaker 3>failures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his own internal disputes.</v>

870
00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:54.290
<v Speaker 3>So he's sort of externalize those in</v>
<v Speaker 3>this weird way and become this</v>

871
00:41:54.590 --> 00:41:56.240
<v Speaker 3>aggressive kind of shitty person.</v>

872
00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:59.480
<v Speaker 3>Like here's a perfect example of that in</v>
<v Speaker 3>my opinion,</v>

873
00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:01.940
<v Speaker 3>in a successful person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump,</v>

874
00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:03.860
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

875
00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:07.220
<v Speaker 3>why is that guy so shitty about</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mexicans?</v>

876
00:42:07.221 --> 00:42:09.590
<v Speaker 3>Why doesn't he have a balanced nuance</v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective?</v>

877
00:42:09.591 --> 00:42:12.410
<v Speaker 3>Why doesn't he understand that you were</v>
<v Speaker 3>insanely lucky?</v>

878
00:42:12.411 --> 00:42:16.700
<v Speaker 3>You Fuck your dad gave you what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2 million bucks to start a business and</v>

879
00:42:16.701 --> 00:42:16.921
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

880
00:42:16.921 --> 00:42:20.630
<v Speaker 3>you make it seem like it's no big deal</v>
<v Speaker 3>that your dad loaned you all this money</v>

881
00:42:20.631 --> 00:42:22.490
<v Speaker 3>and you're a self made man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's ridiculous.</v>

882
00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:24.830
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you live in America and you're white.</v>

883
00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:26.330
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right away,</v>

884
00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:29.840
<v Speaker 3>you're lucky as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then you're involved in this system</v>

885
00:42:29.841 --> 00:42:33.830
<v Speaker 3>that it's allowed you to fail and go</v>
<v Speaker 3>bankrupt and you know,</v>

886
00:42:33.831 --> 00:42:36.410
<v Speaker 3>and skirt away from all your bills then</v>
<v Speaker 3>come back.</v>

887
00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:41.620
<v Speaker 3>But the idea being that here's the guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>that has this insanely successful life</v>

888
00:42:42.621 --> 00:42:44.960
<v Speaker 3>monetarily,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yet still,</v>

889
00:42:45.350 --> 00:42:48.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll have these ridiculous short,</v>

890
00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:53.540
<v Speaker 3>shortsighted opinions that he rants and</v>
<v Speaker 3>about and talks about and these,</v>

891
00:42:53.541 --> 00:42:55.790
<v Speaker 3>like these Syrian refugees and he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

892
00:42:55.791 --> 00:42:57.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we need to keep out of the country,</v>

893
00:42:57.710 --> 00:43:00.370
<v Speaker 3>keep keep Muslims out of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to figure out what the hell's</v>

894
00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:01.190
<v Speaker 3>going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

895
00:43:01.190 --> 00:43:03.290
<v Speaker 3>what the hell is going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what you're again,</v>

896
00:43:03.291 --> 00:43:06.920
<v Speaker 3>you're not dealing with units,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with massive amounts of</v>

897
00:43:06.921 --> 00:43:09.350
<v Speaker 3>human beings that are all different and</v>
<v Speaker 3>varied.</v>

898
00:43:09.351 --> 00:43:13.430
<v Speaker 3>Like why does he have this sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>aggressive fuck you,</v>

899
00:43:13.431 --> 00:43:14.990
<v Speaker 3>you're a loser approach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>

900
00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:16.910
<v Speaker 3>what is the conflict?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How does,</v>

901
00:43:17.150 --> 00:43:21.830
<v Speaker 3>how does he get out of that and have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>more balanced perspective to deal with</v>

902
00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:23.660
<v Speaker 3>what is really in a lot of people's</v>
<v Speaker 3>eyes,</v>

903
00:43:23.661 --> 00:43:26.450
<v Speaker 3>people that are way more unfortunate</v>
<v Speaker 3>than he is.</v>

904
00:43:27.330 --> 00:43:27.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

905
00:43:27.990 --> 00:43:32.190
<v Speaker 2>there's a bias in society to just</v>
<v Speaker 2>appreciate these external success is,</v>

906
00:43:32.191 --> 00:43:33.190
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're wealthy,</v>

907
00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:34.410
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've accomplished this.</v>

908
00:43:34.650 --> 00:43:39.650
<v Speaker 2>But we undervalue those in the victories</v>
<v Speaker 2>over that internal self to get somebody</v>

909
00:43:40.171 --> 00:43:42.900
<v Speaker 2>more conscious,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get somebody more open in their heart,</v>

910
00:43:42.901 --> 00:43:47.100
<v Speaker 2>like those are like shoved to the side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So everybody's been kissing trump's ass</v>

911
00:43:47.101 --> 00:43:49.650
<v Speaker 2>because of the power that this money</v>
<v Speaker 2>creates in the power of that.</v>

912
00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:52.890
<v Speaker 2>And we may even vote him in as president</v>
<v Speaker 2>in this crazy,</v>

913
00:43:52.891 --> 00:43:57.390
<v Speaker 2>crazy world even though he's completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>ignored probably the most important</v>

914
00:43:57.391 --> 00:44:00.600
<v Speaker 2>thing that any human could do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is go inside and have that</v>

915
00:44:00.601 --> 00:44:03.000
<v Speaker 2>accurate self reflection like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

916
00:44:03.001 --> 00:44:06.210
<v Speaker 2>am I a Douche bag right now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the best ways to do that is</v>

917
00:44:06.211 --> 00:44:10.110
<v Speaker 2>with the plants or with meditation or</v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere where you get still and allow</v>

918
00:44:10.111 --> 00:44:14.160
<v Speaker 2>that force of consciousness to actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>take control of the helm of the mind.</v>

919
00:44:14.161 --> 00:44:16.620
<v Speaker 2>Push the ego aside and show you the</v>
<v Speaker 2>truth.</v>

920
00:44:16.621 --> 00:44:18.240
<v Speaker 2>But that's why people are terrified of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

921
00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:20.300
<v Speaker 2>That's why trump will never,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

922
00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:22.530
<v Speaker 2>go do Iowaska and the jungle and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>never.</v>

923
00:44:22.650 --> 00:44:25.020
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you will.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe he would be amazing.</v>

924
00:44:25.021 --> 00:44:26.440
<v Speaker 2>If you want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

925
00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.310
<v Speaker 2>I'll hook it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will hook you up.</v>

926
00:44:29.370 --> 00:44:30.870
<v Speaker 2>We'll go down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'll be.</v>

927
00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:32.520
<v Speaker 2>Could you imagine</v>

928
00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:37.500
<v Speaker 1>if like in mid cycle he just completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>shifted gears and said,</v>

929
00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:42.560
<v Speaker 1>I had a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a revelation and I realized that</v>

930
00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:46.950
<v Speaker 1>what were the direction we're going in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not right.</v>

931
00:44:47.220 --> 00:44:48.150
<v Speaker 1>Everybody be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

932
00:44:48.151 --> 00:44:50.880
<v Speaker 1>you are our only hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're Obi wan Kenobi.</v>

933
00:44:50.881 --> 00:44:53.700
<v Speaker 1>Motherfucker year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're Obi wan Kenobi for white people.</v>

934
00:44:54.150 --> 00:44:55.710
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who else is there?</v>

935
00:44:55.740 --> 00:44:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Hillary Clinton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck out of here.</v>

936
00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:00.510
<v Speaker 1>There's so many guys that are just not</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to vote for a woman.</v>

937
00:45:00.540 --> 00:45:02.280
<v Speaker 1>Especially a woman who was married to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Clinton,</v>

938
00:45:02.281 --> 00:45:04.410
<v Speaker 1>who looks like a shrew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just not happening.</v>

939
00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:04.981
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who else?</v>

940
00:45:04.981 --> 00:45:07.230
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get the fuck out of here.</v>

941
00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:09.540
<v Speaker 1>There's so many people that are not</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to vote for Bernie Sanders.</v>

942
00:45:09.810 --> 00:45:14.580
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you realize that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to literally literally 90 percent.</v>

943
00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:17.850
<v Speaker 1>He wants to tax rich people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ninety percent like this.</v>

944
00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.830
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought like,</v>

945
00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:20.970
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not true.</v>

946
00:45:20.970 --> 00:45:23.340
<v Speaker 1>He didn't really say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's probably an exaggeration.</v>

947
00:45:23.370 --> 00:45:24.180
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

948
00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:26.490
<v Speaker 1>He's actually said that and he goes back</v>
<v Speaker 1>to like,</v>

949
00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:29.220
<v Speaker 1>I think it was Roosevelt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot who it was.</v>

950
00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:32.490
<v Speaker 1>It was an office during the war and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was at one point in time where</v>

951
00:45:32.491 --> 00:45:37.491
<v Speaker 1>they sort of effectively taxed rich</v>
<v Speaker 1>people at extremely high rates and you</v>

952
00:45:37.561 --> 00:45:39.120
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about the efficiency of</v>

953
00:45:39.121 --> 00:45:42.090
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea of taking money from</v>

954
00:45:42.091 --> 00:45:46.560
<v Speaker 1>successful people and just such an</v>
<v Speaker 1>insane disproportionate amount and then</v>

955
00:45:46.561 --> 00:45:49.980
<v Speaker 1>giving it to what the government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is the government,</v>

956
00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:54.900
<v Speaker 1>the biggest waster of money to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fuck like lifelong politicians and</v>

957
00:45:54.901 --> 00:45:59.901
<v Speaker 1>people that are for whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>working government jobs like get outta</v>

958
00:46:00.310 --> 00:46:02.370
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just take the money from</v>

959
00:46:02.371 --> 00:46:04.890
<v Speaker 1>people that have achieved that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the solution and it's an</v>

960
00:46:04.891 --> 00:46:07.860
<v Speaker 1>ineffective strategy because you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>only tax people on their income.</v>

961
00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:09.660
<v Speaker 1>You can't tax them on their wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

962
00:46:09.661 --> 00:46:13.170
<v Speaker 1>It's all income tax based.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all of the wealth that's already been</v>

963
00:46:13.171 --> 00:46:15.250
<v Speaker 1>accumulated by all of these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

964
00:46:15.330 --> 00:46:18.480
<v Speaker 1>you can't even get that money anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're just taxing the people who</v>

965
00:46:18.630 --> 00:46:21.690
<v Speaker 1>finally are getting successful enough to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the money as well as some of the</v>

966
00:46:21.691 --> 00:46:24.960
<v Speaker 1>people who have residual money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not going to even achieve</v>

967
00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:27.450
<v Speaker 1>practically pragmatically what he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to do.</v>

968
00:46:27.451 --> 00:46:30.720
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to be Robin Hood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except he's only taking the new money.</v>

969
00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:33.150
<v Speaker 1>Not the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not The existing 90 percent of the</v>

970
00:46:33.151 --> 00:46:35.070
<v Speaker 1>wealth that's all stored up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a crazy.</v>

971
00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:37.200
<v Speaker 1>It's just crazy all around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>

972
00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:41.520
<v Speaker 1>the unfortunate part is his ideas on</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much everything else are pretty</v>

973
00:46:41.521 --> 00:46:42.600
<v Speaker 1>fucking cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

974
00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:44.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's like he has this dichotomy and</v>

975
00:46:44.761 --> 00:46:48.330
<v Speaker 1>that's these choices that we get stuck</v>
<v Speaker 1>with your alright,</v>

976
00:46:48.450 --> 00:46:49.320
<v Speaker 1>pretty good over here.</v>

977
00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:53.700
<v Speaker 1>But you're totally completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>incompetent in this one area.</v>

978
00:46:53.850 --> 00:46:55.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's this weird thing,</v>

979
00:46:55.621 --> 00:46:57.300
<v Speaker 1>these weird choices that we have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make.</v>

980
00:46:57.330 --> 00:46:58.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we get anything other than</v>

981
00:46:58.981 --> 00:47:01.320
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to established people</v>

982
00:47:01.321 --> 00:47:03.540
<v Speaker 1>running for president of United States</v>
<v Speaker 1>of America,</v>

983
00:47:03.541 --> 00:47:05.280
<v Speaker 1>I think in order to get to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>position,</v>

984
00:47:05.520 --> 00:47:08.790
<v Speaker 1>you have to be so compromised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to be so deeply entrenched in</v>

985
00:47:08.791 --> 00:47:12.750
<v Speaker 1>this insanely flawed system that someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was really radically outside of it</v>

986
00:47:12.751 --> 00:47:14.040
<v Speaker 1>is looking at it and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

987
00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:17.850
<v Speaker 1>this whole idea is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having one person running the whole</v>

988
00:47:17.851 --> 00:47:20.640
<v Speaker 1>thing is preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make any sense.</v>

989
00:47:20.641 --> 00:47:24.000
<v Speaker 1>It might work if there was 50 of us and</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if there was 50 of us,</v>

990
00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:28.230
<v Speaker 1>there'd be like 20 people that don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how it's running and but the idea</v>

991
00:47:28.231 --> 00:47:31.060
<v Speaker 1>to do it with three plus million people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's insane.</v>

992
00:47:31.090 --> 00:47:31.720
<v Speaker 1>It's insane.</v>

993
00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:34.390
<v Speaker 1>It's insane to have this one guy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we watched.</v>

994
00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:37.180
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders looks like he's a</v>

995
00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:39.250
<v Speaker 1>thousand years old now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck is he going to look like</v>

996
00:47:39.251 --> 00:47:41.380
<v Speaker 1>after four years in office?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

997
00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:44.560
<v Speaker 1>that guy is going to be dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama looks like dog shit.</v>

998
00:47:44.830 --> 00:47:48.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean he looks old as fuck right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you compare him to what he looked</v>

999
00:47:48.881 --> 00:47:52.240
<v Speaker 1>like seven years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is not seven years of aging at some</v>

1000
00:47:52.290 --> 00:47:57.290
<v Speaker 1>radically accelerated aging due to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stress and tension and the reality of</v>

1001
00:47:57.911 --> 00:48:01.240
<v Speaker 1>the world itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the massive grain of his hair.</v>

1002
00:48:01.390 --> 00:48:04.510
<v Speaker 1>He just looks tired all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He looks like a different person.</v>

1003
00:48:04.511 --> 00:48:09.511
<v Speaker 1>It looks much more frail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean he's experiencing some insane</v>

1004
00:48:10.121 --> 00:48:13.840
<v Speaker 1>stress and part of that stress is a job</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you're not supposed to do.</v>

1005
00:48:14.110 --> 00:48:17.320
<v Speaker 1>No one's supposed to have that job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not so opposed to have the weight</v>

1006
00:48:17.321 --> 00:48:18.154
<v Speaker 1>of the world.</v>

1007
00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:20.500
<v Speaker 1>You have to sleep in this fucking house</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the park.</v>

1008
00:48:20.501 --> 00:48:24.790
<v Speaker 1>And if people around you constantly</v>
<v Speaker 1>earpieces and guns and bulletproof cars,</v>

1009
00:48:24.910 --> 00:48:27.390
<v Speaker 1>look at the difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1010
00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:29.740
<v Speaker 1>it's brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fucking difference.</v>

1011
00:48:29.741 --> 00:48:34.720
<v Speaker 1>We're looking at a photo right now of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama from 2009 and Obama from 2014 and</v>

1012
00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:38.680
<v Speaker 1>all my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he looks like he's 20 years old</v>

1013
00:48:38.681 --> 00:48:43.681
<v Speaker 1>plus 20 years older plus and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and really the tools to help people cope</v>

1014
00:48:43.781 --> 00:48:48.781
<v Speaker 1>with that kind of stress or just tools</v>
<v Speaker 1>that aren't really that prevalent and</v>

1015
00:48:49.031 --> 00:48:52.390
<v Speaker 1>talked about like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is he doing to help mitigate that,</v>

1016
00:48:52.391 --> 00:48:53.224
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is he,</v>

1017
00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:55.270
<v Speaker 1>is he going in the float tank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1018
00:48:55.271 --> 00:48:59.440
<v Speaker 1>is he doing these different things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to do to be able to release</v>

1019
00:48:59.500 --> 00:49:01.780
<v Speaker 1>some of that stress and be supported</v>
<v Speaker 1>properly?</v>

1020
00:49:02.110 --> 00:49:04.150
<v Speaker 1>Definitely not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one's fucked,</v>

1021
00:49:04.151 --> 00:49:05.710
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This photo is fucked.</v>

1022
00:49:06.250 --> 00:49:08.830
<v Speaker 1>We're looking at him from 2008 and 2013.</v>

1023
00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:11.980
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The poor bastard.</v>

1024
00:49:13.900 --> 00:49:17.920
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't you love to just have that guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>to sit down with them and go,</v>

1025
00:49:18.040 --> 00:49:22.210
<v Speaker 1>tell me what is really going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just tell me,</v>

1026
00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:24.880
<v Speaker 1>what is it like when you get in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking office?</v>

1027
00:49:25.110 --> 00:49:27.520
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who are you talking to from Halliburton?</v>

1028
00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:28.590
<v Speaker 1>Who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1029
00:49:28.590 --> 00:49:33.590
<v Speaker 1>what dude pops out of a fucking a metal</v>
<v Speaker 1>grate in the ground with steam and fire</v>

1030
00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:36.890
<v Speaker 1>and presents to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1031
00:49:36.900 --> 00:49:41.900
<v Speaker 1>he like he hands you want to pitch fork</v>
<v Speaker 1>of manifesto of ideas that,</v>

1032
00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this military industrial complex wants</v>

1033
00:49:45.611 --> 00:49:50.611
<v Speaker 1>you to promote any kind of leadership</v>
<v Speaker 1>position is really crazy.</v>

1034
00:49:50.770 --> 00:49:53.050
<v Speaker 1>I think if I was thinking about it</v>
<v Speaker 1>recently in war,</v>

1035
00:49:53.290 --> 00:49:55.960
<v Speaker 1>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you applaud these generals for these</v>

1036
00:49:55.961 --> 00:49:57.420
<v Speaker 1>great strategies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1037
00:49:57.430 --> 00:49:59.620
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes the strategy is you put a</v>

1038
00:49:59.621 --> 00:50:04.180
<v Speaker 1>small number of troops in one area to</v>
<v Speaker 1>lead the main core of your enemy army</v>

1039
00:50:04.181 --> 00:50:07.420
<v Speaker 1>toward those troops so that you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>trick them and attack their flank or</v>

1040
00:50:07.421 --> 00:50:07.990
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>

1041
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:10.330
<v Speaker 1>Classic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like General Strategy.</v>

1042
00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:13.000
<v Speaker 1>But really what you're saying is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

1043
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:15.610
<v Speaker 1>these hundred people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna die for sure.</v>

1044
00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:18.130
<v Speaker 1>Like they're gonna die for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who's up?</v>

1045
00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:19.120
<v Speaker 1>Who's up for that one?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

1046
00:50:19.121 --> 00:50:22.600
<v Speaker 1>you guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go into die for sure category and</v>

1047
00:50:22.601 --> 00:50:25.300
<v Speaker 1>then the rest of the army will come and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll kick some ass.</v>

1048
00:50:25.570 --> 00:50:28.580
<v Speaker 1>Like what a fucked up that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1049
00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:31.910
<v Speaker 1>like knowingly saying that you have no</v>
<v Speaker 1>chance.</v>

1050
00:50:31.940 --> 00:50:35.360
<v Speaker 1>Like there's no fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no like you can run away through</v>

1051
00:50:35.361 --> 00:50:37.190
<v Speaker 1>the back hills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to fucking die.</v>

1052
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:40.580
<v Speaker 1>That's the plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that we can kick more ass over here.</v>

1053
00:50:40.790 --> 00:50:45.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean you have to be something of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sociopath to be able to pull that off.</v>

1054
00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:46.520
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's.</v>

1055
00:50:46.550 --> 00:50:51.140
<v Speaker 1>You know what these great general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these quote unquote great generals have</v>

1056
00:50:51.141 --> 00:50:55.220
<v Speaker 1>all had to do is just make these crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions and being president is a</v>

1057
00:50:55.221 --> 00:50:56.390
<v Speaker 1>little bit a part of that too.</v>

1058
00:50:56.390 --> 00:51:01.390
<v Speaker 1>You have so many people that they become</v>
<v Speaker 1>like numbers and it's no longer just</v>

1059
00:51:01.761 --> 00:51:04.940
<v Speaker 1>each individual like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how's this going to affect this dude?</v>

1060
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:07.310
<v Speaker 1>This dude who is me living a different</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

1061
00:51:07.311 --> 00:51:10.310
<v Speaker 1>How's it gonna Affect that dude?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you can't think about like that</v>

1062
00:51:10.311 --> 00:51:12.410
<v Speaker 1>because you go crazy if we're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

1063
00:51:12.411 --> 00:51:17.330
<v Speaker 1>It's just a weird dynamic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we're not really prepared for.</v>

1064
00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:19.280
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're prepared for these kinds of tribal</v>

1065
00:51:19.281 --> 00:51:20.780
<v Speaker 1>dynamics where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1066
00:51:20.781 --> 00:51:22.760
<v Speaker 1>we're working,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know everybody that we're leading.</v>

1067
00:51:22.761 --> 00:51:25.940
<v Speaker 1>There's the chief of the tribe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's under 150 people.</v>

1068
00:51:25.941 --> 00:51:27.980
<v Speaker 1>If you look through anthropological</v>
<v Speaker 1>records,</v>

1069
00:51:27.981 --> 00:51:30.230
<v Speaker 1>that's usually how it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's generally,</v>

1070
00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:32.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leader back in the kind of tribal</v>

1071
00:51:32.421 --> 00:51:35.660
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then as it gets massive shit gets</v>

1072
00:51:35.661 --> 00:51:36.800
<v Speaker 1>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1073
00:51:36.850 --> 00:51:41.850
<v Speaker 1>I think in war there's the ethos of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>warrior and the warrior ethos is it's a</v>

1074
00:51:42.681 --> 00:51:47.150
<v Speaker 1>different reality and I think for a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those guys not talk to this one dude</v>

1075
00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:52.210
<v Speaker 1>who's a navy seal and he was explaining</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the way a lot of guys look at it</v>

1076
00:51:53.961 --> 00:51:57.020
<v Speaker 1>and him included was that if he died in</v>
<v Speaker 1>combat,</v>

1077
00:51:57.021 --> 00:51:59.810
<v Speaker 1>that he would die as a warrior and that</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would,</v>

1078
00:51:59.870 --> 00:52:04.820
<v Speaker 1>if he was killed by another warrior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a time honored way to go and</v>

1079
00:52:04.821 --> 00:52:06.170
<v Speaker 1>that this is just the way.</v>

1080
00:52:06.530 --> 00:52:10.100
<v Speaker 1>And this is the ways pursuing that he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>accepted that way and because he's</v>

1081
00:52:10.101 --> 00:52:13.820
<v Speaker 1>accepted that way and all of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>exciting aspects of it,</v>

1082
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:17.900
<v Speaker 1>like one of the things you talked to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that have been to war about it,</v>

1083
00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:20.630
<v Speaker 1>like Jocko says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the greatest time of his life.</v>

1084
00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:24.860
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to say that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm glad he does.</v>

1085
00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:28.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm glad he's honest about it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>when someone's honest about it,</v>

1086
00:52:29.330 --> 00:52:31.340
<v Speaker 1>folks like you and I that are outside of</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1087
00:52:31.341 --> 00:52:32.120
<v Speaker 1>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1088
00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:34.550
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well how do I fucking internalize this?</v>

1089
00:52:34.551 --> 00:52:37.010
<v Speaker 1>How do I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do I absorb this information and</v>

1090
00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:40.490
<v Speaker 1>bounce it around in my head and make it</v>
<v Speaker 1>have it make sense to me?</v>

1091
00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:42.800
<v Speaker 1>But he's being honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's saying,</v>

1092
00:52:42.801 --> 00:52:44.600
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the life I chose.</v>

1093
00:52:44.601 --> 00:52:48.230
<v Speaker 1>This is the path I wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm there and I'm very excited and happy</v>

1094
00:52:48.231 --> 00:52:48.980
<v Speaker 1>to be there.</v>

1095
00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:52.160
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy to lead and I'm happy to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>warrior.</v>

1096
00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:56.000
<v Speaker 1>So if you're going to die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know you live,</v>

1097
00:52:56.001 --> 00:52:58.160
<v Speaker 1>you die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is he wrong?</v>

1098
00:52:58.161 --> 00:52:59.270
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

1099
00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:00.070
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>

1100
00:53:00.070 --> 00:53:04.910
<v Speaker 1>we have this idea that the way we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>living is the only way to live and that</v>

1101
00:53:04.940 --> 00:53:09.320
<v Speaker 1>this is the wrong way to live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you want to fucking make Omelets,</v>

1102
00:53:09.650 --> 00:53:11.990
<v Speaker 1>you gotta crack eggs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to get into Ramadi,</v>

1103
00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:13.700
<v Speaker 1>he gonna have to shoot some bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1104
00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:18.770
<v Speaker 1>there's just no way around it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then to have that accomplished.</v>

1105
00:53:18.970 --> 00:53:20.870
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we could all agree that there's</v>

1106
00:53:20.871 --> 00:53:23.270
<v Speaker 1>some bad people in the world in order</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

1107
00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:26.250
<v Speaker 1>to somehow or another keep those bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>from going straight up.</v>

1108
00:53:26.251 --> 00:53:29.040
<v Speaker 1>Hitler on us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's some ass kicking has to be done</v>

1109
00:53:29.520 --> 00:53:32.010
<v Speaker 1>in the current state of humanity the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is right now.</v>

1110
00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:33.140
<v Speaker 1>Unless we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1111
00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:35.760
<v Speaker 1>utilize my method from shining happy</v>
<v Speaker 1>jihad.</v>

1112
00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:39.240
<v Speaker 1>My 2006 CD where I say we use crop</v>
<v Speaker 1>duster planes,</v>

1113
00:53:39.270 --> 00:53:43.830
<v Speaker 1>fucking cover the entire Middle East</v>
<v Speaker 1>with chronic smoke for a couple months.</v>

1114
00:53:44.100 --> 00:53:47.400
<v Speaker 1>And even that might not work to do as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sober up and go back to the old ways.</v>

1115
00:53:47.790 --> 00:53:51.030
<v Speaker 1>Unless something radical happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it changes humanity.</v>

1116
00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:54.870
<v Speaker 1>We're always going to have this struggle</v>
<v Speaker 1>between quote unquote good and evil.</v>

1117
00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:59.220
<v Speaker 1>And when you have evil you need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need ass kickers.</v>

1118
00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:00.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have ass kickers,</v>

1119
00:54:00.841 --> 00:54:03.930
<v Speaker 1>you got a real fucking problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you need people that have this</v>

1120
00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:07.350
<v Speaker 1>warrior ethos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this mentality to go in there and get</v>

1121
00:54:07.351 --> 00:54:10.710
<v Speaker 1>the job done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes that means you have to</v>

1122
00:54:10.711 --> 00:54:13.200
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice troops or you have to put them</v>
<v Speaker 1>in danger.</v>

1123
00:54:13.230 --> 00:54:15.710
<v Speaker 1>You have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to understand that there's</v>

1124
00:54:15.750 --> 00:54:18.570
<v Speaker 1>going to be risks and those risks are</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be horrific.</v>

1125
00:54:18.720 --> 00:54:21.270
<v Speaker 1>The results of those risks are</v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially horrific.</v>

1126
00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:23.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's absolutely what you have to</v>

1127
00:54:23.431 --> 00:54:24.900
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually something that the body</v>

1128
00:54:24.901 --> 00:54:26.450
<v Speaker 1>does really well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1129
00:54:26.451 --> 00:54:28.620
<v Speaker 1>if you think of all the cells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like many organisms,</v>

1130
00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:31.170
<v Speaker 1>think about what happens when you go</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a Cryo tank.</v>

1131
00:54:31.530 --> 00:54:34.710
<v Speaker 1>You know when you go into a Cryo tank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the blood rushes to the core of</v>

1132
00:54:34.711 --> 00:54:36.810
<v Speaker 1>your body to protect the most vital</v>
<v Speaker 1>parts.</v>

1133
00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:37.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your organs,</v>

1134
00:54:37.921 --> 00:54:41.490
<v Speaker 1>the things that you need for the whole</v>
<v Speaker 1>organism to survive the blood leaves the</v>

1135
00:54:41.491 --> 00:54:43.260
<v Speaker 1>extremities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the fingers and the toes.</v>

1136
00:54:43.261 --> 00:54:44.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it,</v>

1137
00:54:44.281 --> 00:54:44.980
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fingers,</v>

1138
00:54:44.980 --> 00:54:45.640
<v Speaker 1>toes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1139
00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:46.890
<v Speaker 1>you gotta go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're on your own,</v>

1140
00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:49.080
<v Speaker 1>like if you die you die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to live,</v>

1141
00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:49.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by doing that.</v>

1142
00:54:49.981 --> 00:54:52.650
<v Speaker 1>And that's kind of the way that these</v>
<v Speaker 1>armies have to go.</v>

1143
00:54:52.651 --> 00:54:55.110
<v Speaker 1>So there is certainly a model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

1144
00:54:55.111 --> 00:54:59.910
<v Speaker 1>I would hate to be that person that</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks out at some garrison of 100 people</v>

1145
00:54:59.911 --> 00:55:02.730
<v Speaker 1>and being like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going in this basically suicide</v>

1146
00:55:02.731 --> 00:55:04.230
<v Speaker 1>mission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the rest of us can do.</v>

1147
00:55:04.740 --> 00:55:06.600
<v Speaker 1>It's a brutal thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

1148
00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:08.010
<v Speaker 1>the warrior ethos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1149
00:55:08.011 --> 00:55:09.780
<v Speaker 1>these people would go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1150
00:55:09.781 --> 00:55:11.340
<v Speaker 1>look at you and probably go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1151
00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:11.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1152
00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:13.920
<v Speaker 1>this is it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what we're committed to,</v>

1153
00:55:13.921 --> 00:55:16.470
<v Speaker 1>the mission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mission is greater even than our</v>

1154
00:55:16.471 --> 00:55:17.550
<v Speaker 1>lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1155
00:55:17.610 --> 00:55:20.700
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of people that look at</v>

1156
00:55:20.701 --> 00:55:23.790
<v Speaker 1>the way the world works and as far as</v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict and say,</v>

1157
00:55:23.791 --> 00:55:26.250
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only reason why we're involved in</v>

1158
00:55:26.251 --> 00:55:29.580
<v Speaker 1>these conflicts is because United States</v>
<v Speaker 1>is invaded all these countries and</v>

1159
00:55:29.581 --> 00:55:33.360
<v Speaker 1>they've done this and the foreign policy</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's caused this and that.</v>

1160
00:55:33.361 --> 00:55:36.480
<v Speaker 1>And there's probably a lot of truth to</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1161
00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:39.750
<v Speaker 1>There's probably a lot of truth to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day,</v>

1162
00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:44.780
<v Speaker 1>there has always in less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire world is brought to the exact</v>

1163
00:55:45.331 --> 00:55:50.331
<v Speaker 1>same standards as far as standards of</v>
<v Speaker 1>living as far as access to resources as</v>

1164
00:55:50.611 --> 00:55:52.830
<v Speaker 1>far as just peace on earth.</v>

1165
00:55:53.070 --> 00:55:55.770
<v Speaker 1>If the entire world is not up to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same standards,</v>

1166
00:55:55.980 --> 00:55:57.930
<v Speaker 1>you always going to have conflict and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're always gonna.</v>

1167
00:55:57.960 --> 00:56:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Have ambitious people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He always gonna have those pollutants</v>

1168
00:56:00.361 --> 00:56:02.220
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You always going to have these dudes</v>

1169
00:56:02.221 --> 00:56:06.630
<v Speaker 1>that just decide to just dominate a</v>
<v Speaker 1>country that's smaller than them or take</v>

1170
00:56:06.631 --> 00:56:09.930
<v Speaker 1>over an area of the world and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have horrific human</v>

1171
00:56:09.931 --> 00:56:11.910
<v Speaker 1>rights violations and then you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make choices.</v>

1172
00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:16.380
<v Speaker 1>Do we allow this country that's doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>this to this smaller country and</v>

1173
00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:20.310
<v Speaker 1>subjugating it's people and torturing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the women and won't let girls go to</v>

1174
00:56:20.311 --> 00:56:24.190
<v Speaker 1>school and do we allow that to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or we decide that we're the police</v>

1175
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:29.190
<v Speaker 3>force of the world and it's a.</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a complicated question because when</v>

1176
00:56:29.561 --> 00:56:32.800
<v Speaker 3>you don't do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then evil grows and then it becomes</v>

1177
00:56:32.801 --> 00:56:36.760
<v Speaker 3>really powerful and then you get to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hitler type situation that can happen.</v>

1178
00:56:36.910 --> 00:56:37.601
<v Speaker 3>People think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1179
00:56:37.601 --> 00:56:39.490
<v Speaker 3>that's not gonna happen today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

1180
00:56:39.670 --> 00:56:41.380
<v Speaker 3>That was not long ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1181
00:56:41.410 --> 00:56:44.950
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't seem like if you look at</v>
<v Speaker 3>those black and white night,</v>

1182
00:56:45.570 --> 00:56:47.820
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's got his arm up in the air and</v>

1183
00:56:47.821 --> 00:56:51.070
<v Speaker 3>fucking people screaming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like eons ago.</v>

1184
00:56:51.130 --> 00:56:52.360
<v Speaker 3>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nineteen forties,</v>

1185
00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:53.890
<v Speaker 3>forties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1186
00:56:54.370 --> 00:56:57.120
<v Speaker 2>Love externalizing an enemy and you see</v>
<v Speaker 2>it now.</v>

1187
00:56:57.121 --> 00:56:59.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually starting to happen with</v>

1188
00:56:59.181 --> 00:57:00.710
<v Speaker 2>all Muslims,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all Muslims.</v>

1189
00:57:00.711 --> 00:57:05.711
<v Speaker 2>For some people have become the enemy</v>
<v Speaker 2>because instead of it makes it really</v>

1190
00:57:06.111 --> 00:57:08.990
<v Speaker 2>easy to define yourself against an</v>
<v Speaker 2>external force.</v>

1191
00:57:08.991 --> 00:57:12.020
<v Speaker 2>Where as I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really difficult to actually go</v>

1192
00:57:12.170 --> 00:57:15.030
<v Speaker 2>within and battle those internal forces</v>
<v Speaker 2>where you know,</v>

1193
00:57:15.110 --> 00:57:17.420
<v Speaker 2>the real conflict is raging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's much easier to say,</v>

1194
00:57:17.421 --> 00:57:19.130
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fuck and Muslims.</v>

1195
00:57:19.131 --> 00:57:20.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go get them.</v>

1196
00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:21.591
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

1197
00:57:21.591 --> 00:57:25.640
<v Speaker 2>I think a tendency that we've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all we've all had is just to go fight</v>

1198
00:57:25.641 --> 00:57:29.060
<v Speaker 2>these external things in this crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>video game we call life.</v>

1199
00:57:29.090 --> 00:57:31.190
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we like the boss battles and we like</v>

1200
00:57:31.520 --> 00:57:34.550
<v Speaker 2>that kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that aspect of the game because it's</v>

1201
00:57:34.551 --> 00:57:36.800
<v Speaker 2>very active.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's very proactive.</v>

1202
00:57:36.801 --> 00:57:39.860
<v Speaker 2>You're out there with your hands and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're swinging and you're shooting and</v>

1203
00:57:39.861 --> 00:57:40.694
<v Speaker 2>you're doing things.</v>

1204
00:57:41.380 --> 00:57:44.930
<v Speaker 2>Whereas like these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly the internal battles,</v>

1205
00:57:44.931 --> 00:57:46.880
<v Speaker 2>you have to have a totally different</v>
<v Speaker 2>strategy.</v>

1206
00:57:46.881 --> 00:57:49.790
<v Speaker 2>It's the strategy of actively</v>
<v Speaker 2>surrendering,</v>

1207
00:57:49.791 --> 00:57:51.020
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1208
00:57:51.021 --> 00:57:53.360
<v Speaker 2>I got to let that go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to let go of that attachment.</v>

1209
00:57:53.361 --> 00:57:56.060
<v Speaker 2>I got to see myself and be okay with my</v>
<v Speaker 2>death.</v>

1210
00:57:56.061 --> 00:57:58.910
<v Speaker 2>I got to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a completely reverse side of</v>

1211
00:57:58.911 --> 00:58:01.940
<v Speaker 2>the coin where to make progress in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's surrender.</v>

1212
00:58:01.941 --> 00:58:04.520
<v Speaker 2>Whereas to make progress and more it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>vigor,</v>

1213
00:58:04.730 --> 00:58:05.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like these,</v>

1214
00:58:05.810 --> 00:58:10.280
<v Speaker 2>these two dichotomies and I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately the way the game is best</v>

1215
00:58:10.281 --> 00:58:12.860
<v Speaker 2>played because if you're playing on both</v>
<v Speaker 2>sides of the coin,</v>

1216
00:58:13.060 --> 00:58:16.550
<v Speaker 2>you know you're playing externally with</v>
<v Speaker 2>vigor and you're playing internally with</v>

1217
00:58:16.551 --> 00:58:19.820
<v Speaker 2>that surrender forest and advancing on</v>
<v Speaker 2>both sides.</v>

1218
00:58:19.821 --> 00:58:20.630
<v Speaker 2>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1219
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:24.080
<v Speaker 2>that is the idea of the warrior poet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the the warrior who can go</v>

1220
00:58:24.081 --> 00:58:28.700
<v Speaker 2>externally like Musashi and kick some</v>
<v Speaker 2>ass and then go back to his dojo and</v>

1221
00:58:28.701 --> 00:58:30.020
<v Speaker 2>paint colors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>calligraphy,</v>

1222
00:58:30.021 --> 00:58:34.070
<v Speaker 2>and tap into his internal thoughts are</v>
<v Speaker 2>in meditation or are all of these</v>

1223
00:58:34.071 --> 00:58:34.551
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1224
00:58:34.551 --> 00:58:37.550
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me the ideal one is not better than</v>

1225
00:58:37.551 --> 00:58:39.260
<v Speaker 2>the other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're both important,</v>

1226
00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:42.650
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just let's expand the opportunities that</v>

1227
00:58:42.651 --> 00:58:46.070
<v Speaker 2>we have as humans to play both sides of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this amazing game and</v>

1228
00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:48.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think there's parallels to with what</v>

1229
00:58:48.211 --> 00:58:51.690
<v Speaker 3>we're talking about about the body.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then we want things to change quickly,</v>

1230
00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:53.730
<v Speaker 3>but the body does not change quickly the</v>
<v Speaker 3>body.</v>

1231
00:58:53.731 --> 00:58:58.731
<v Speaker 3>It's sort of a long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>slow process and I think that's what's</v>

1232
00:58:59.521 --> 00:59:04.140
<v Speaker 3>going on with society and civilization</v>
<v Speaker 3>itself,</v>

1233
00:59:04.520 --> 00:59:06.150
<v Speaker 3>that there's this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We would like,</v>

1234
00:59:06.180 --> 00:59:09.540
<v Speaker 3>we want war to be over.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want everybody to live at peace.</v>

1235
00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:14.720
<v Speaker 3>We want everybody to have a livable wage</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you shouldn't live in poverty and we</v>

1236
00:59:15.020 --> 00:59:16.920
<v Speaker 3>got too many.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's wealth disparity.</v>

1237
00:59:16.921 --> 00:59:18.750
<v Speaker 3>We're going to fix it all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know it,</v>

1238
00:59:18.990 --> 00:59:23.990
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't necessarily work that way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The debate is going to start changing</v>

1239
00:59:25.041 --> 00:59:26.890
<v Speaker 3>people's ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people's ideas,</v>

1240
00:59:26.900 --> 00:59:28.640
<v Speaker 3>going to change their behavior and their</v>
<v Speaker 3>actions,</v>

1241
00:59:28.880 --> 00:59:32.000
<v Speaker 3>and then ultimately we would hope that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd get to a better place than we were</v>

1242
00:59:32.001 --> 00:59:37.001
<v Speaker 3>today someday.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just like if we look back at 1200 add</v>

1243
00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:40.790
<v Speaker 3>and look at today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we would all agree this is a way</v>

1244
00:59:40.791 --> 00:59:41.624
<v Speaker 3>better place.</v>

1245
00:59:41.830 --> 00:59:42.663
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1246
00:59:42.890 --> 00:59:46.240
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean the heart of the dark ages where</v>

1247
00:59:46.250 --> 00:59:48.180
<v Speaker 3>it's actually literally dark outside,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>

1248
00:59:48.350 --> 00:59:51.230
<v Speaker 3>but also just the practices were</v>
<v Speaker 3>completely fucked.</v>

1249
00:59:51.231 --> 00:59:54.020
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>think of the inquisition that was,</v>

1250
00:59:54.050 --> 00:59:56.690
<v Speaker 3>that was the most ridiculous thing in</v>
<v Speaker 3>history.</v>

1251
00:59:56.720 --> 00:59:59.600
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of these people burned at the stake</v>

1252
00:59:59.840 --> 01:00:03.470
<v Speaker 3>for some weird idea that they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which witches aren't real?</v>

1253
01:00:03.530 --> 01:00:05.760
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sounds a lot like what's going the</v>

1254
01:00:05.810 --> 01:00:08.210
<v Speaker 3>hysteria that's going on today about</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isis,</v>

1255
01:00:08.770 --> 01:00:13.770
<v Speaker 3>these ideologies that manifests</v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves and become toxic to all those</v>

1256
01:00:16.161 --> 01:00:21.161
<v Speaker 3>around them until people rally against</v>
<v Speaker 3>it or realized the folly of that way and</v>

1257
01:00:21.801 --> 01:00:23.750
<v Speaker 3>then change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They meet that resistance.</v>

1258
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:28.990
<v Speaker 3>They find this horrible thing in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world and they resist it and they fight</v>

1259
01:00:29.031 --> 01:00:33.500
<v Speaker 3>against it and then things get better</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's kind of like a constant cycle</v>

1260
01:00:33.501 --> 01:00:35.420
<v Speaker 3>that's going on that we would like to</v>
<v Speaker 3>end.</v>

1261
01:00:35.450 --> 01:00:37.190
<v Speaker 3>We were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we would like it to be over now,</v>

1262
01:00:37.191 --> 01:00:39.560
<v Speaker 3>please.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We would like to not have conflict,</v>

1263
01:00:39.561 --> 01:00:41.360
<v Speaker 3>but we've got a lot of problems.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

1264
01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:43.560
<v Speaker 3>we don't understand each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's fucking what?</v>

1265
01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:45.860
<v Speaker 3>How many different languages do you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know?</v>

1266
01:00:46.100 --> 01:00:48.260
<v Speaker 3>How many languages are there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck those people</v>

1267
01:00:48.261 --> 01:00:49.170
<v Speaker 3>are saying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know.</v>

1268
01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:52.430
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have some people that I follow on</v>

1269
01:00:52.431 --> 01:00:54.710
<v Speaker 3>twitter that are Russian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a Russian fighters,</v>

1270
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:57.980
<v Speaker 3>and they'll occasionally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll tweet something with their crazy</v>

1271
01:00:57.981 --> 01:01:01.480
<v Speaker 3>Russian words.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those Russian letters.</v>

1272
01:01:01.650 --> 01:01:04.310
<v Speaker 3>That one looks like a tree house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Looks like pants,</v>

1273
01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:06.760
<v Speaker 3>pants,</v>
<v Speaker 3>treehouse.</v>

1274
01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:10.120
<v Speaker 3>What are you trying to say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck is that like?</v>

1275
01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:12.030
<v Speaker 3>What is he saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't worry.</v>

1276
01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:14.300
<v Speaker 3>Or Hebrew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1277
01:01:14.301 --> 01:01:15.770
<v Speaker 3>you see people that write in Hebrew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

1278
01:01:15.771 --> 01:01:17.210
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that.</v>

1279
01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:20.390
<v Speaker 3>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This even these aren't even letters or</v>

1280
01:01:20.391 --> 01:01:24.320
<v Speaker 3>Chinese or Japanese or Korean or all</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking Christ.</v>

1281
01:01:24.570 --> 01:01:29.570
<v Speaker 3>We see we can't understand each other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's the idea of all of us coming to</v>

1282
01:01:30.981 --> 01:01:35.981
<v Speaker 3>these same conclusions and having these</v>
<v Speaker 3>same ideals when the world vary so</v>

1283
01:01:36.771 --> 01:01:41.771
<v Speaker 3>radically and drastically as far as</v>
<v Speaker 3>conditions and poverty and you know,</v>

1284
01:01:41.811 --> 01:01:42.210
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

1285
01:01:42.210 --> 01:01:45.470
<v Speaker 3>and then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>places like North Korea that had just</v>

1286
01:01:45.471 --> 01:01:50.471
<v Speaker 3>been under the boot of a dictator since</v>
<v Speaker 3>the jump and they're just stuck.</v>

1287
01:01:50.811 --> 01:01:52.820
<v Speaker 3>They're stuck in this insanely shitty</v>
<v Speaker 3>spot.</v>

1288
01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.680
<v Speaker 3>The idea that your life in Pasadena is</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be the same as some guy who's</v>

1289
01:01:57.681 --> 01:02:00.410
<v Speaker 3>stuck in North Korea who might,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1290
01:02:00.411 --> 01:02:02.750
<v Speaker 3>as mother and father might've grown up</v>
<v Speaker 3>in prison.</v>

1291
01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:05.090
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's people that are born and raised</v>

1292
01:02:05.091 --> 01:02:06.430
<v Speaker 3>in prison camps.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're,</v>

1293
01:02:06.990 --> 01:02:08.800
<v Speaker 3>the world's not even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

1294
01:02:08.801 --> 01:02:13.801
<v Speaker 3>it's just not an until we get past all</v>
<v Speaker 3>of these conflicts that we see right</v>

1295
01:02:14.781 --> 01:02:16.220
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to be even.</v>

1296
01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:19.380
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to simply the United</v>
<v Speaker 3>States just stops invading these</v>

1297
01:02:19.381 --> 01:02:20.790
<v Speaker 3>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything's going to be great.</v>

1298
01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:22.390
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to.</v>

1299
01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:24.930
<v Speaker 3>It's now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to fix North Korea,</v>

1300
01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:29.820
<v Speaker 3>just not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's way more complicated and they don't</v>

1301
01:02:29.821 --> 01:02:32.760
<v Speaker 3>know they've lived this way their entire</v>
<v Speaker 3>lives.</v>

1302
01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:35.460
<v Speaker 3>Many of them don't even know how it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on,</v>

1303
01:02:35.461 --> 01:02:38.940
<v Speaker 3>like what's going on in the rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world and they're not.</v>

1304
01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:41.370
<v Speaker 3>They're not going to change that</v>
<v Speaker 3>quickly.</v>

1305
01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:43.890
<v Speaker 3>It's going to take a long ass time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They might have to die off.</v>

1306
01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:47.010
<v Speaker 3>That might be what's going on with</v>
<v Speaker 3>United States politics as well.</v>

1307
01:02:47.670 --> 01:02:52.350
<v Speaker 3>When you're looking at what we're seeing</v>
<v Speaker 3>now with Hillary Clinton and Bernie</v>

1308
01:02:52.350 --> 01:02:56.730
<v Speaker 3>Sanders and Donald Trump and ted Cruz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get the fuck out of here.</v>

1309
01:02:57.060 --> 01:02:59.370
<v Speaker 3>When I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I'm looking at in my mind is like a</v>

1310
01:02:59.371 --> 01:03:02.730
<v Speaker 3>dying campfire so he can kick around a</v>
<v Speaker 3>few embers.</v>

1311
01:03:03.030 --> 01:03:04.650
<v Speaker 3>There's like a little something left</v>
<v Speaker 3>here,</v>

1312
01:03:05.430 --> 01:03:08.070
<v Speaker 3>but it's eventually going to die off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1313
01:03:08.071 --> 01:03:08.760
<v Speaker 3>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1314
01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:11.040
<v Speaker 3>these are this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no teddy Roosevelt's.</v>

1315
01:03:11.190 --> 01:03:13.110
<v Speaker 3>There's no JFK.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's,</v>

1316
01:03:13.150 --> 01:03:15.710
<v Speaker 3>there's no fucking real leaders that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>running okay.</v>

1317
01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:19.550
<v Speaker 2>I think they'll only come when the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people demand that they come when the</v>

1318
01:03:19.551 --> 01:03:22.340
<v Speaker 2>people demand that people have</v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness or reading them.</v>

1319
01:03:22.341 --> 01:03:25.070
<v Speaker 2>But now at this point we're too easily</v>
<v Speaker 2>distracted.</v>

1320
01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:27.350
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were they found these little hooks,</v>

1321
01:03:27.351 --> 01:03:31.790
<v Speaker 2>these ways to tug and pull at our</v>
<v Speaker 2>emotions and our fears and our different</v>

1322
01:03:31.791 --> 01:03:36.791
<v Speaker 2>things that Kinda influence us into</v>
<v Speaker 2>following these different preset paths.</v>

1323
01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:40.400
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know I'm not big into the whole</v>

1324
01:03:40.401 --> 01:03:44.480
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy of the whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but certainly it's very good marketing</v>

1325
01:03:44.481 --> 01:03:49.190
<v Speaker 2>propaganda to hook people into following</v>
<v Speaker 2>certain preset channels that keep the</v>

1326
01:03:49.191 --> 01:03:53.360
<v Speaker 2>establishment where it is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but eventually that will break and I do</v>

1327
01:03:53.361 --> 01:03:57.800
<v Speaker 2>think that's one of the reasons why</v>
<v Speaker 2>there has been some intentional</v>

1328
01:03:57.830 --> 01:04:02.450
<v Speaker 2>oppression of these mind expanding</v>
<v Speaker 2>consciousness tools that are available</v>

1329
01:04:02.451 --> 01:04:07.451
<v Speaker 2>to us because those tend to allow you to</v>
<v Speaker 2>see the see the machine behind the</v>

1330
01:04:07.671 --> 01:04:08.170
<v Speaker 2>curtain.</v>

1331
01:04:08.170 --> 01:04:10.000
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that lets you see Oz.</v>

1332
01:04:10.010 --> 01:04:10.940
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1333
01:04:10.941 --> 01:04:14.470
<v Speaker 2>I see you pulling that lever bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I know I kind of want to know</v>

1334
01:04:14.471 --> 01:04:17.150
<v Speaker 2>what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's a dangerous thing when you</v>

1335
01:04:17.151 --> 01:04:19.520
<v Speaker 2>have this big establishment that's built</v>
<v Speaker 2>on that.</v>

1336
01:04:19.521 --> 01:04:23.150
<v Speaker 2>But I'm really optimistic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that it's going to change</v>

1337
01:04:23.151 --> 01:04:26.120
<v Speaker 2>because of the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think actually a lot of these things</v>

1338
01:04:26.121 --> 01:04:29.090
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't have been allowed to get to</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they are if the Internet had</v>

1339
01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:32.660
<v Speaker 2>already been around from the beginning</v>
<v Speaker 2>because whistleblowers have been coming</v>

1340
01:04:32.661 --> 01:04:35.420
<v Speaker 2>out information would it spread,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that same force,</v>

1341
01:04:35.421 --> 01:04:37.550
<v Speaker 2>that free spread of information is going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to start,</v>

1342
01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:40.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking away all of these different</v>

1343
01:04:40.491 --> 01:04:44.720
<v Speaker 2>shenanigans and all of these tricks that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people are going on right now.</v>

1344
01:04:44.721 --> 01:04:47.270
<v Speaker 2>We're just kind of tolerating them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but eventually I'll.</v>

1345
01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:51.410
<v Speaker 2>Tolerance will get less and less and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think that will be an interesting and</v>

1346
01:04:51.411 --> 01:04:52.040
<v Speaker 2>exciting</v>

1347
01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:52.871
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1348
01:04:52.871 --> 01:04:55.630
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I also think that when you look at</v>

1349
01:04:55.870 --> 01:05:00.870
<v Speaker 3>the way we conduct politics today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way how the debates,</v>

1350
01:05:01.390 --> 01:05:04.150
<v Speaker 3>they all stand in the most unnatural way</v>
<v Speaker 3>possible.</v>

1351
01:05:04.151 --> 01:05:07.660
<v Speaker 3>You're at a podium,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which never happens in life.</v>

1352
01:05:07.661 --> 01:05:10.180
<v Speaker 3>When do you ever talk to a friend?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They stand in front of a podium.</v>

1353
01:05:10.510 --> 01:05:12.520
<v Speaker 3>Can you imagine?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if your girlfriend said,</v>

1354
01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:14.950
<v Speaker 3>hey rob,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on over man,</v>

1355
01:05:14.951 --> 01:05:16.510
<v Speaker 3>I'd really love to have a conversation</v>
<v Speaker 3>with you.</v>

1356
01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:18.220
<v Speaker 3>And then behind a podium</v>

1357
01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:21.250
<v Speaker 1>and she's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's your podium and this is my</v>

1358
01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:24.970
<v Speaker 1>friend margie and Margie is going to act</v>
<v Speaker 1>as our moderator and you're going to</v>

1359
01:05:24.971 --> 01:05:26.980
<v Speaker 1>state your point and then I'm going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>state my point.</v>

1360
01:05:26.981 --> 01:05:30.490
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have an audience and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience is going to cheer or respond in</v>

1361
01:05:30.491 --> 01:05:32.830
<v Speaker 1>turn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like why is there a fucking audience?</v>

1362
01:05:32.831 --> 01:05:35.950
<v Speaker 1>These debates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is there's this grand standing</v>

1363
01:05:35.951 --> 01:05:40.000
<v Speaker 1>opportunity where you can say what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States people deserve.</v>

1364
01:05:40.001 --> 01:05:42.730
<v Speaker 1>It's a fair wage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we deserve,</v>

1365
01:05:42.731 --> 01:05:44.080
<v Speaker 1>what we want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we want,</v>

1366
01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.090
<v Speaker 1>equal rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we want.</v>

1367
01:05:46.210 --> 01:05:48.730
<v Speaker 1>Black lives matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you say all these things that</v>

1368
01:05:48.731 --> 01:05:50.840
<v Speaker 1>make people yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

1369
01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:53.200
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all orchestrated.</v>

1370
01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:56.050
<v Speaker 1>It's all artificial and it's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

1371
01:05:56.090 --> 01:05:59.500
<v Speaker 1>It's the least natural and normal way to</v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate possible.</v>

1372
01:05:59.830 --> 01:06:02.920
<v Speaker 1>Normal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural way to communicate would be sit</v>

1373
01:06:02.921 --> 01:06:07.540
<v Speaker 1>down and have a conversation with these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and try to figure out what are</v>

1374
01:06:07.541 --> 01:06:09.190
<v Speaker 1>your plans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to do this?</v>

1375
01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:12.580
<v Speaker 1>And then the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the world that's watching</v>

1376
01:06:12.581 --> 01:06:15.040
<v Speaker 1>this gets to decipher and try to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

1377
01:06:15.041 --> 01:06:16.540
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this guy makes sense?</v>

1378
01:06:16.710 --> 01:06:18.880
<v Speaker 1>Is he full of shit he nobody's talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

1379
01:06:18.881 --> 01:06:21.100
<v Speaker 1>Does he have the data that he says he</v>
<v Speaker 1>does?</v>

1380
01:06:21.101 --> 01:06:25.960
<v Speaker 1>Does he have the possible resources to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fix these issues and does this plan</v>

1381
01:06:25.990 --> 01:06:27.760
<v Speaker 1>makes sense fiscally?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does it.</v>

1382
01:06:27.900 --> 01:06:31.750
<v Speaker 1>Is there their numbers to actually pull</v>
<v Speaker 1>this off or is it bullshit,</v>

1383
01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:33.900
<v Speaker 1>but you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to that when you're.</v>

1384
01:06:33.901 --> 01:06:38.470
<v Speaker 1>You're involved in this debate where</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy standing there talking.</v>

1385
01:06:38.650 --> 01:06:41.260
<v Speaker 1>There's a whole fucking crowd of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>behind him.</v>

1386
01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:42.970
<v Speaker 1>Then these people that are on</v>
<v Speaker 1>spotlights,</v>

1387
01:06:42.971 --> 01:06:45.670
<v Speaker 1>they're wearing makeup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have notes in front of them like,</v>

1388
01:06:45.671 --> 01:06:47.620
<v Speaker 1>what is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the end?</v>

1389
01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:51.040
<v Speaker 1>Does that person have the character and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that character under pressure?</v>

1390
01:06:51.270 --> 01:06:53.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the most important things.</v>

1391
01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:56.620
<v Speaker 1>Like when there's forces of pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are you going to crumble?</v>

1392
01:06:56.621 --> 01:06:58.970
<v Speaker 1>Like even when I'm hiring,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1393
01:06:59.030 --> 01:07:01.960
<v Speaker 1>add on it in the company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like one of the most important things is</v>

1394
01:07:01.961 --> 01:07:03.220
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have the skills,</v>

1395
01:07:03.221 --> 01:07:04.840
<v Speaker 1>like what exactly what you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about?</v>

1396
01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:07.300
<v Speaker 1>Have you done this before?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you capable of,</v>

1397
01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:09.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a chief technical officer,</v>

1398
01:07:09.191 --> 01:07:10.660
<v Speaker 1>what's the code that you've written?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1399
01:07:10.661 --> 01:07:12.940
<v Speaker 1>how have you been able to handle these</v>
<v Speaker 1>situations,</v>

1400
01:07:12.941 --> 01:07:15.790
<v Speaker 1>but then there's also like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to handle pressure?</v>

1401
01:07:15.940 --> 01:07:16.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for me,</v>

1402
01:07:16.961 --> 01:07:21.670
<v Speaker 1>like that's a really important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll do things informally to kind of</v>

1403
01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:24.580
<v Speaker 1>test people out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like we'll go do a workout if they're</v>

1404
01:07:24.581 --> 01:07:25.360
<v Speaker 1>athletic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1405
01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:29.320
<v Speaker 1>we'll go do a hard workout and just see</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of how they handle that external</v>

1406
01:07:29.321 --> 01:07:33.310
<v Speaker 1>pressure will go out and get really</v>
<v Speaker 1>drunk and go out drinking and see like,</v>

1407
01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:34.450
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're drunk,</v>

1408
01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:38.590
<v Speaker 1>like does some weird shit come up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>little demons that are hiding in there</v>

1409
01:07:38.591 --> 01:07:39.760
<v Speaker 1>that we need to find out about.</v>

1410
01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:43.780
<v Speaker 1>And so eventually then you get this</v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to see and sometimes I'm</v>

1411
01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:45.820
<v Speaker 1>dead wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been dead wrong before,</v>

1412
01:07:46.090 --> 01:07:48.580
<v Speaker 1>but then at that point you have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to just say,</v>

1413
01:07:48.670 --> 01:07:49.600
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was wrong.</v>

1414
01:07:49.601 --> 01:07:51.910
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't the right fit and you know,</v>

1415
01:07:51.990 --> 01:07:53.530
<v Speaker 1>you're out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But America doesn't have that</v>

1416
01:07:53.531 --> 01:07:55.240
<v Speaker 1>opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course you could impeach somebody,</v>

1417
01:07:55.241 --> 01:07:57.370
<v Speaker 1>but that's this crazy process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1418
01:07:57.410 --> 01:08:01.090
<v Speaker 1>it's just this weird thing where you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have all of this false hype and</v>

1419
01:08:01.091 --> 01:08:03.640
<v Speaker 1>propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they're there and then they're just</v>

1420
01:08:03.641 --> 01:08:06.820
<v Speaker 1>there right now and it's like there's no</v>
<v Speaker 1>accountability at that point.</v>

1421
01:08:06.821 --> 01:08:08.740
<v Speaker 1>You don't really know what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1422
01:08:08.741 --> 01:08:12.460
<v Speaker 1>Clinton was the last person to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>through an impeachment procedure,</v>

1423
01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:15.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they essentially ever get that</v>

1424
01:08:15.441 --> 01:08:16.274
<v Speaker 1>far.</v>

1425
01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:19.490
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what will impeachment.</v>

1426
01:08:19.491 --> 01:08:21.800
<v Speaker 3>We think of impeachment is being removed</v>
<v Speaker 3>from office,</v>

1427
01:08:22.370 --> 01:08:27.020
<v Speaker 3>but a peach meant impeachment</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially is being forced to sit down</v>

1428
01:08:27.021 --> 01:08:30.290
<v Speaker 3>and review whether or not you should be</v>
<v Speaker 3>removed from office.</v>

1429
01:08:30.680 --> 01:08:33.530
<v Speaker 3>I think they actually get kicked out is</v>
<v Speaker 3>a different phrase,</v>

1430
01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:37.820
<v Speaker 3>different term,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was and he was on the most</v>

1431
01:08:37.821 --> 01:08:41.540
<v Speaker 3>preposterous thing ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Getting head like it wasn't.</v>

1432
01:08:41.690 --> 01:08:44.450
<v Speaker 3>It didn't have anything to do with how</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was running the country.</v>

1433
01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:49.480
<v Speaker 3>It was him lying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way he described this encounter with</v>

1434
01:08:51.141 --> 01:08:55.130
<v Speaker 3>this woman's mouth and his penis.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know that it is.</v>

1435
01:08:55.190 --> 01:08:58.430
<v Speaker 3>The way he understands that was not</v>
<v Speaker 3>sexual relations.</v>

1436
01:08:58.890 --> 01:09:01.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the definition of is is.</v>

1437
01:09:02.090 --> 01:09:04.220
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a great line that he had there.</v>

1438
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:07.100
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember that conversation where</v>
<v Speaker 3>they.</v>

1439
01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:12.120
<v Speaker 3>They were grilling him and they were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were giving him this.</v>

1440
01:09:13.850 --> 01:09:18.850
<v Speaker 3>They sat down with them and they were</v>
<v Speaker 3>forcing him to recount what happened and</v>

1441
01:09:19.130 --> 01:09:23.150
<v Speaker 3>describe in his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in his eyes why he felt like he wasn't</v>

1442
01:09:23.151 --> 01:09:27.800
<v Speaker 3>lying and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as as the way it was defined to me,</v>

1443
01:09:28.370 --> 01:09:33.370
<v Speaker 3>I do not think that I had sex with that</v>
<v Speaker 3>person and it was this weird fucking</v>

1444
01:09:34.190 --> 01:09:36.590
<v Speaker 3>dance they were doing where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

1445
01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:40.880
<v Speaker 3>What are we doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's supposed to be about intent.</v>

1446
01:09:41.150 --> 01:09:42.770
<v Speaker 3>What is intent?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like did anything,</v>

1447
01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:44.950
<v Speaker 3>did anything happen with that check?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like can,</v>

1448
01:09:45.010 --> 01:09:46.730
<v Speaker 3>can you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you guys hook up?</v>

1449
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:48.680
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where hookup is like well</v>

1450
01:09:48.830 --> 01:09:50.090
<v Speaker 3>defined.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hook up,</v>

1451
01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:54.290
<v Speaker 3>hook up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As far as it's been explained to me.</v>

1452
01:09:54.291 --> 01:09:57.260
<v Speaker 3>I did not hook up with that woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And what is hookup?</v>

1453
01:09:57.290 --> 01:10:00.620
<v Speaker 3>You got to ask fucker asked to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mouth counts</v>

1454
01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:05.570
<v Speaker 3>just jerks you off of the Oval Office</v>
<v Speaker 3>desk.</v>

1455
01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:06.230
<v Speaker 3>That's nothing.</v>

1456
01:10:06.230 --> 01:10:07.730
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's that.</v>

1457
01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:12.050
<v Speaker 3>Who Care exactly does care.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the crazy.</v>

1458
01:10:12.110 --> 01:10:14.570
<v Speaker 3>Well we care because we catch you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we catch you.</v>

1459
01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:17.750
<v Speaker 3>We catch you lying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's one of the unique things</v>

1460
01:10:17.751 --> 01:10:21.350
<v Speaker 3>about a guy like Charlie Sheen because</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a lot of ways charlie sheen really</v>

1461
01:10:21.351 --> 01:10:24.320
<v Speaker 3>did sort of pull the curtain back on a</v>
<v Speaker 3>different machine,</v>

1462
01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:26.590
<v Speaker 3>the machine of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of,</v>

1463
01:10:26.591 --> 01:10:31.591
<v Speaker 3>of sort of what is it that people have a</v>
<v Speaker 3>real issue with when someone gets caught</v>

1464
01:10:33.111 --> 01:10:37.280
<v Speaker 3>doing something like whether it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>smoking crack like Charlie Sheen did or</v>

1465
01:10:37.281 --> 01:10:39.440
<v Speaker 3>whether it's getting blown like Clinton</v>
<v Speaker 3>did.</v>

1466
01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:41.510
<v Speaker 3>What is it that we really have a problem</v>
<v Speaker 3>with?</v>

1467
01:10:41.810 --> 01:10:45.470
<v Speaker 3>I think we really have a problem with</v>
<v Speaker 3>almost more than anything is dishonesty.</v>

1468
01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:50.600
<v Speaker 3>And when he was onstage when Clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well it was a wherever he was,</v>

1469
01:10:50.601 --> 01:10:53.870
<v Speaker 3>where he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I did not have sexual relations with</v>

1470
01:10:53.871 --> 01:10:56.960
<v Speaker 3>that woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you see him say that and you know</v>

1471
01:10:56.961 --> 01:10:57.800
<v Speaker 3>he got his dick suck.</v>

1472
01:10:57.800 --> 01:11:00.920
<v Speaker 3>Do you like wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1473
01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:03.650
<v Speaker 3>well what's going on here man?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause you,</v>

1474
01:11:03.680 --> 01:11:07.490

<v Speaker 3>we're in a situation where I know that</v>

<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>

1479
01:11:19.021 --> 01:11:21.570
<v Speaker 3>as it's been explained to me is how I</v>
<v Speaker 3>feel,</v>

1480
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:23.160
<v Speaker 3>and then you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you deal with all this,</v>

1481
01:11:23.940 --> 01:11:24.990
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

1482
01:11:24.991 --> 01:11:27.450
<v Speaker 3>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that feeling like that.</v>

1483
01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:29.460
<v Speaker 3>Whereas Charlie Sheen comes out and</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes,</v>

1484
01:11:29.461 --> 01:11:31.020
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was smoking rocks,</v>

1485
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:33.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a fucking winter.</v>

1486
01:11:33.181 --> 01:11:34.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm winning every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

1487
01:11:34.681 --> 01:11:35.910
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1488
01:11:35.911 --> 01:11:36.990
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what I do.</v>

1489
01:11:37.200 --> 01:11:37.951
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1490
01:11:37.951 --> 01:11:40.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm banging hookers and smoking rocks.</v>

1491
01:11:40.081 --> 01:11:42.710
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1492
01:11:42.720 --> 01:11:45.450
<v Speaker 3>I guess we're done.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They kid fucking say anything.</v>

1493
01:11:45.970 --> 01:11:47.490
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are you going to say to a guy like</v>

1494
01:11:47.491 --> 01:11:47.670
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>

1495
01:11:47.670 --> 01:11:49.790
<v Speaker 3>Obviously he's not the president.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not running for president,</v>

1496
01:11:49.810 --> 01:11:51.840
<v Speaker 3>not in public office.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not a leader.</v>

1497
01:11:52.020 --> 01:11:54.660
<v Speaker 3>He's just a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But he's a guy that,</v>

1498
01:11:55.170 --> 01:11:56.150
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was,</v>

1499
01:11:56.460 --> 01:11:59.280
<v Speaker 3>it is refreshing when you hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what tiger woods should</v>

1500
01:11:59.281 --> 01:12:01.320
<v Speaker 3>have done when all that shit came out</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he should just spend like,</v>

1501
01:12:01.321 --> 01:12:03.360
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking tiger woods.</v>

1502
01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:04.530
<v Speaker 3>I'm horny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1503
01:12:04.531 --> 01:12:05.350
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

1504
01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:07.510
<v Speaker 3>it's me like deal with it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1505
01:12:07.770 --> 01:12:11.910
<v Speaker 3>instead of being a hard sell to go to</v>
<v Speaker 3>rehab and do these different things like</v>

1506
01:12:11.911 --> 01:12:13.710
<v Speaker 3>sex rehab,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I could,</v>

1507
01:12:13.770 --> 01:12:17.370
<v Speaker 3>I could imagine that there might be some</v>
<v Speaker 3>value in that for somebody,</v>

1508
01:12:17.371 --> 01:12:21.720
<v Speaker 3>but I really think that's just a way for</v>
<v Speaker 3>people to retreat because of these crazy</v>

1509
01:12:21.721 --> 01:12:25.140
<v Speaker 3>societal norms that say we shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>want to bang people.</v>

1510
01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:26.790
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like this is like the,</v>

1511
01:12:26.950 --> 01:12:30.540
<v Speaker 3>the approved bullshit fallback position</v>
<v Speaker 3>that all of us know is bullshit,</v>

1512
01:12:30.541 --> 01:12:33.500
<v Speaker 3>but you have to go play this charade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1513
01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:34.350
<v Speaker 3>and figure it out.</v>

1514
01:12:34.350 --> 01:12:37.530
<v Speaker 3>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we got to all start respecting</v>

1515
01:12:38.180 --> 01:12:41.820
<v Speaker 3>like the truth about each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like everybody likes to have sex.</v>

1516
01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:44.700
<v Speaker 3>Like let's just fucking get over it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deal with it.</v>

1517
01:12:44.701 --> 01:12:46.770
<v Speaker 3>Like it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not only that,</v>

1518
01:12:46.771 --> 01:12:49.140
<v Speaker 3>but the per,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the type of people that wind up being</v>

1519
01:12:49.141 --> 01:12:51.190
<v Speaker 3>president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the you,</v>

1520
01:12:51.191 --> 01:12:56.191
<v Speaker 3>you have to be some insanely confident</v>
<v Speaker 3>achiever and those people generally</v>

1521
01:12:57.990 --> 01:13:01.410
<v Speaker 3>genuinely are generally both like to</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

1522
01:13:02.160 --> 01:13:04.800
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's what the whole jfk thing was</v>

1523
01:13:04.801 --> 01:13:07.080
<v Speaker 3>all about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jfk was apparently like the biggest</v>

1524
01:13:07.081 --> 01:13:10.930
<v Speaker 3>freak of all times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when people who knew him,</v>

1525
01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:13.620
<v Speaker 3>when they see how much of these stories</v>
<v Speaker 3>are true,</v>

1526
01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:15.300
<v Speaker 3>it's up to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1527
01:13:15.301 --> 01:13:16.830
<v Speaker 3>who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we really don't know.</v>

1528
01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:20.850
<v Speaker 3>But what you hear is the ultimate super</v>
<v Speaker 3>freak.</v>

1529
01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:25.950
<v Speaker 3>I mean he was just in this time where</v>
<v Speaker 3>the information didn't spread very</v>

1530
01:13:25.951 --> 01:13:28.260
<v Speaker 3>quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're just getting it now.</v>

1531
01:13:28.590 --> 01:13:32.550
<v Speaker 3>18 when she was in the White House and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he made her blow his friends and stuff</v>

1532
01:13:32.551 --> 01:13:33.840
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like really freaky.</v>

1533
01:13:33.841 --> 01:13:36.720
<v Speaker 3>Like in a pool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I keep the woman that had an affair with</v>

1534
01:13:36.721 --> 01:13:38.130
<v Speaker 3>him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think she was like,</v>

1535
01:13:39.050 --> 01:13:44.050
<v Speaker 3>he had her suck some guy's Dick who was</v>
<v Speaker 3>secretary of state or something like</v>

1536
01:13:44.401 --> 01:13:48.030
<v Speaker 3>that in front of him in a swimming pool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And she wrote this book like,</v>

1537
01:13:48.300 --> 01:13:51.270
<v Speaker 3>like a couple of years ago and it came</v>
<v Speaker 3>out like.</v>

1538
01:13:51.271 --> 01:13:53.490
<v Speaker 3>Or these stories were published a couple</v>
<v Speaker 3>of years ago.</v>

1539
01:13:53.491 --> 01:13:56.610
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes so long for that information to</v>

1540
01:13:56.611 --> 01:13:59.580
<v Speaker 3>come out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if Clinton was in office right now,</v>

1541
01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:02.040
<v Speaker 3>like queued Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1542
01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:05.130
<v Speaker 3>good Lord.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What stories would come out like,</v>

1543
01:14:05.131 --> 01:14:05.940
<v Speaker 3>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>

1544
01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:09.510
<v Speaker 3>But if JFK was in office,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would make Clinton look like a</v>

1545
01:14:09.511 --> 01:14:11.770
<v Speaker 3>fucking in in our eyes because</v>

1546
01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:14.620
<v Speaker 1>the data didn't get out while he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>alive.</v>

1547
01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:17.260
<v Speaker 1>He's a great man and that's how we look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at it.</v>

1548
01:14:17.261 --> 01:14:18.430
<v Speaker 1>We look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a great man.</v>

1549
01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:22.760
<v Speaker 1>That was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a huge champion for civil rights and he</v>

1550
01:14:22.761 --> 01:14:27.520
<v Speaker 1>was gunned down by a horrible person who</v>
<v Speaker 1>is probably working for the CIA during</v>

1551
01:14:27.521 --> 01:14:29.110
<v Speaker 1>his prime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then.</v>

1552
01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:31.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about Putin?</v>

1553
01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:34.710
<v Speaker 1>He's got it locked down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't Russia.</v>

1554
01:14:34.980 --> 01:14:38.230
<v Speaker 1>And nobody's fucking with him in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

1555
01:14:38.290 --> 01:14:39.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's murdering people,</v>

1556
01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:41.740
<v Speaker 1>allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Supposedly.</v>

1557
01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:43.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1558
01:14:43.271 --> 01:14:44.440
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a weird.</v>

1559
01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:46.590
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird thing now where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1560
01:14:46.720 --> 01:14:48.820
<v Speaker 1>there's such a spotlight on the wrong</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

1561
01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:52.390
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we get so easily distracted by these,</v>

1562
01:14:52.520 --> 01:14:54.740
<v Speaker 1>these things that really don't matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1563
01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:56.680
<v Speaker 1>because we've set up this false</v>
<v Speaker 1>paradigm.</v>

1564
01:14:57.250 --> 01:15:01.300
<v Speaker 1>People aren't supposed to have sex and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people able to have the most sex in the</v>

1565
01:15:01.301 --> 01:15:02.980
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most powerful people,</v>

1566
01:15:02.981 --> 01:15:07.180
<v Speaker 1>athletes and presidents are supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be faithful in this monogamous</v>

1567
01:15:07.181 --> 01:15:07.750
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

1568
01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:10.750
<v Speaker 1>And I think as we look forward into the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future,</v>

1569
01:15:11.050 --> 01:15:14.620
<v Speaker 1>I think people are going to start to</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand each other a little bit</v>

1570
01:15:14.621 --> 01:15:17.830
<v Speaker 1>better and some of these expectations</v>
<v Speaker 1>are just going to drop.</v>

1571
01:15:17.831 --> 01:15:21.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean these were some old control</v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanisms put in by the church.</v>

1572
01:15:21.701 --> 01:15:25.120
<v Speaker 1>Like you want someone to be relying on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the church.</v>

1573
01:15:25.121 --> 01:15:29.410
<v Speaker 1>Well make them guilty for something that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will always be guilty for,</v>

1574
01:15:29.411 --> 01:15:31.690
<v Speaker 1>something they cannot control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexual desires.</v>

1575
01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:35.260
<v Speaker 1>Make them guilty for that and make you</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only person to have the cure.</v>

1576
01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:38.920
<v Speaker 1>So create a problem that everybody's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have and have you be the cure</v>

1577
01:15:38.921 --> 01:15:40.000
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can only,</v>

1578
01:15:40.001 --> 01:15:42.490
<v Speaker 1>you can absolve them of their sins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1579
01:15:42.550 --> 01:15:46.240
<v Speaker 1>and it's this old control mechanism that</v>
<v Speaker 1>was put in place,</v>

1580
01:15:46.450 --> 01:15:49.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe partly to keep the society and</v>

1581
01:15:49.001 --> 01:15:52.240
<v Speaker 1>this kind of regimen in order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also to keep one particular</v>

1582
01:15:52.241 --> 01:15:54.640
<v Speaker 1>organization empower and isn't.</v>

1583
01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:59.530
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of a byproduct of our lack of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to read each other's minds and</v>

1584
01:15:59.531 --> 01:16:02.260
<v Speaker 1>truly understand what each other are</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

1585
01:16:02.740 --> 01:16:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Like this ability to find the truth and</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually get information.</v>

1586
01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:09.310
<v Speaker 1>The ability to disguise that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to disguise it.</v>

1587
01:16:09.311 --> 01:16:13.030
<v Speaker 1>With this false morality and this Norman</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rockwell image that you're trying to</v>

1588
01:16:13.031 --> 01:16:18.031
<v Speaker 1>project all that leads to this like</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive confusion as to what the actual</v>

1589
01:16:19.211 --> 01:16:24.211
<v Speaker 1>playing field we're on really is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when we look at these media created</v>

1590
01:16:24.371 --> 01:16:28.990
<v Speaker 1>versions of our world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's murder she wrote or CSI or</v>

1591
01:16:29.170 --> 01:16:34.170
<v Speaker 1>a television show or a movie or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>coldplay song or some distorted version</v>

1592
01:16:34.330 --> 01:16:38.710
<v Speaker 1>of human beings that we absorb into our</v>
<v Speaker 1>database.</v>

1593
01:16:39.040 --> 01:16:40.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's wonderful because this is the real</v>
<v Speaker 3>clinics with the real clinics would was</v>

1609
01:17:17.811 --> 01:17:21.140
<v Speaker 3>the guy who was married to a woman who</v>
<v Speaker 3>made him do a reality show and I love</v>

1610
01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:22.220
<v Speaker 3>cleaning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't get me wrong,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I'm a giant fan of the Spaghetti</v>

1612
01:17:27.290 --> 01:17:32.290
<v Speaker 3>Westerns and the unforgiven and no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but who he is as a man is just a.</v>

1613
01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:36.950
<v Speaker 3>just an old man who's a republican and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

1614
01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:41.980
<v Speaker 3>because of the fact that he's famous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they allowed him to go on stage at this</v>

1615
01:17:42.590 --> 01:17:47.590
<v Speaker 3>convention or whatever the fuck it was</v>
<v Speaker 3>and give this insane speech where he had</v>

1616
01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:52.210
<v Speaker 3>a chair next to him and he pretended it</v>
<v Speaker 3>was Obama and he actually like was</v>

1617
01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:55.280
<v Speaker 3>standing over him looking down on them</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1618
01:17:55.281 --> 01:17:56.660
<v Speaker 3>watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is hilarious.</v>

01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:58.010
<v Speaker 3>You go to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to laugh your ass</v>

1620
01:17:58.260 --> 01:18:03.030
<v Speaker 4>ministration hasn't done enough to cure</v>
<v Speaker 4>that and whatever.</v>

1621
01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:08.480
<v Speaker 4>Whatever interests they have is not</v>
<v Speaker 4>strong enough and I think possibly now</v>

1622
01:18:10.591 --> 01:18:14.370
<v Speaker 4>it may be time for somebody else to come</v>
<v Speaker 4>along and solve the</v>

1623
01:18:22.730 --> 01:18:24.440
<v Speaker 5>stand up white people.</v>

1624
01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:31.950
<v Speaker 4>Mr. President,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you,</v>

1625
01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:36.210
<v Speaker 4>how do you handle?</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you handle promises that you've</v>

1626
01:18:36.211 --> 01:18:40.120
<v Speaker 4>made when you were running for election</v>
<v Speaker 4>and how do you handle it?</v>

1627
01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:41.810
<v Speaker 4>How do you handle it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1628
01:18:41.880 --> 01:18:45.080
<v Speaker 4>what do you say to people or do you</v>
<v Speaker 4>could just.</v>

1629
01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:48.630
<v Speaker 4>I know people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1630
01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:52.470
<v Speaker 4>people were wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't.</v>

1631
01:18:54.650 --> 01:18:56.400
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know even some of the people in your</v>

1632
01:18:56.401 --> 01:18:58.400
<v Speaker 4>own party who were very disappointed and</v>
<v Speaker 4>we did,</v>

1633
01:18:58.401 --> 01:19:01.260
<v Speaker 4>didn't close Gitmo and I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

1634
01:19:01.261 --> 01:19:03.900
<v Speaker 4>I think get Kale closing Gitmo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why close that?</v>

1635
01:19:03.901 --> 01:19:06.510
<v Speaker 4>We spent so much money on it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

1636
01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:12.480
<v Speaker 4>I thought maybe it's an excuse.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you mean?</v>

1637
01:19:12.481 --> 01:19:15.920
<v Speaker 4>Shut up?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1638
01:19:16.190 --> 01:19:18.730
<v Speaker 4>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was just because somebody</v>

1639
01:19:18.731 --> 01:19:23.470
<v Speaker 4>had this stupid idea of trying</v>
<v Speaker 4>terrorists and downtown New York City</v>

1640
01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:23.830
<v Speaker 4>maybe.</v>

1641
01:19:23.830 --> 01:19:24.663
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1642
01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:30.360
<v Speaker 4>If anybody wants</v>

1643
01:19:30.580 --> 01:19:32.660
<v Speaker 3>us,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's wonderful to watch because</v>

1644
01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.490
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure a nice guy.</v>

1645
01:19:37.610 --> 01:19:38.440
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1646
01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:40.160
<v Speaker 3>Cleaning doesn't seem to be a terrible</v>
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>

1647
01:19:40.430 --> 01:19:43.400
<v Speaker 3>but just why close get my.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We spent so much money on it.</v>

1648
01:19:43.430 --> 01:19:46.330
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't fucking keep the gas chambers</v>

1649
01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:48.500
<v Speaker 3>open in Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure they spent money on those two.</v>

1650
01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:52.430
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck kind of argument is that</v>
<v Speaker 3>why close Gitmo?</v>

1651
01:19:52.431 --> 01:19:56.420
<v Speaker 3>We spent so much money on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is some wacky old man,</v>

1652
01:19:56.421 --> 01:19:58.310
<v Speaker 3>republican thinking right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

1653
01:19:58.350 --> 01:19:59.183
<v Speaker 3>The.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The idea that</v>

1654
01:19:59.350 --> 01:20:00.400
<v Speaker 6>say that will,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what will,</v>

1655
01:20:00.401 --> 01:20:01.234
<v Speaker 6>what will.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

1656
01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:04.030
<v Speaker 6>We will work closer with George Martin</v>

1657
01:20:04.530 --> 01:20:07.290
<v Speaker 3>glass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck he talking about.</v>

1658
01:20:07.470 --> 01:20:10.800
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about a place where people</v>
<v Speaker 3>are pulled out of school where people</v>

1659
01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:14.760
<v Speaker 3>might've went to the wrong meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They might have known someone who knew</v>

1660
01:20:14.761 --> 01:20:19.200
<v Speaker 3>somebody and they get locked up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put in these orange jumpsuits and stuck</v>

1661
01:20:19.201 --> 01:20:21.930
<v Speaker 3>in these fucking camps for a decade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1662
01:20:21.931 --> 01:20:23.820
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's not a good idea to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1663
01:20:25.700 --> 01:20:29.540
<v Speaker 2>You know what works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you brought up a good point when</v>

1664
01:20:29.541 --> 01:20:31.340
<v Speaker 2>you said if people could read each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other's minds.</v>

1665
01:20:31.341 --> 01:20:34.430
<v Speaker 2>I think Bertrand Russell explored that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the philosopher and he was saying that,</v>

1666
01:20:34.750 --> 01:20:36.680
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>initially it would just be whore.</v>

1667
01:20:36.681 --> 01:20:38.630
<v Speaker 2>Everybody would retreat to their homes</v>
<v Speaker 2>and be like,</v>

1668
01:20:38.631 --> 01:20:40.220
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world's fucking crazy.</v>

1669
01:20:40.460 --> 01:20:42.620
<v Speaker 2>But eventually you just get kind of used</v>
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>

1670
01:20:42.690 --> 01:20:43.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you'd be like,</v>

1671
01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:46.850
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody has these same thoughts and</v>

1672
01:20:46.851 --> 01:20:50.000
<v Speaker 2>these same things that are going on in</v>
<v Speaker 2>their head and then everybody could</v>

1673
01:20:50.240 --> 01:20:53.300
<v Speaker 2>actually start to track truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1674
01:20:53.301 --> 01:20:55.010
<v Speaker 2>and just realize that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1675
01:20:55.011 --> 01:20:58.400
<v Speaker 2>everybody's thinking about pussy and or</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dick or whatever you're thinking about.</v>

1676
01:20:58.401 --> 01:21:02.810
<v Speaker 2>Everybody has these urges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has these conflicting forces inside</v>

1677
01:21:02.811 --> 01:21:05.720
<v Speaker 2>their own heads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even weird thoughts,</v>

1678
01:21:05.721 --> 01:21:07.520
<v Speaker 2>weird thoughts when you're on this high</v>
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>

1679
01:21:07.521 --> 01:21:08.980
<v Speaker 2>that weird thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1680
01:21:08.990 --> 01:21:10.220
<v Speaker 2>maybe I should just jump off.</v>

1681
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:11.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like what happened?</v>

1682
01:21:11.361 --> 01:21:15.740
<v Speaker 2>They're like these weird things that all</v>
<v Speaker 2>of us have that we shoved down deep in</v>

1683
01:21:15.741 --> 01:21:17.270
<v Speaker 2>some nook and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not me.</v>

1684
01:21:17.271 --> 01:21:18.290
<v Speaker 2>That's not me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not me.</v>

1685
01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:21.890
<v Speaker 2>You all have these fucked up things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all have that urge when we see a kid</v>

1686
01:21:21.891 --> 01:21:25.340
<v Speaker 2>making a beautiful sandcastle being man</v>
<v Speaker 2>and be funny to just knock that shit</v>

1687
01:21:25.341 --> 01:21:27.350
<v Speaker 2>over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though we'd never want to do it.</v>

1688
01:21:27.530 --> 01:21:29.690
<v Speaker 2>Like we have these crazy parts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves.</v>

1689
01:21:29.740 --> 01:21:31.790
<v Speaker 2>I think that's something that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1690
01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:35.660
<v Speaker 2>as I've gotten this past year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did some pretty the most intense</v>

1691
01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:38.690
<v Speaker 2>psychedelic journeys of my life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which actually I've never talked to you</v>

1692
01:21:38.691 --> 01:21:39.830
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1693
01:21:40.190 --> 01:21:44.600
<v Speaker 2>but part of it was just reconciling the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that we're a lot of things.</v>

1694
01:21:44.601 --> 01:21:48.020
<v Speaker 2>We're not just the good thing that we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that we think we are,</v>

1695
01:21:48.021 --> 01:21:51.360
<v Speaker 2>we're kind of everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all parts where all the good were</v>

1696
01:21:51.361 --> 01:21:53.990
<v Speaker 2>all of the bad and we're just a</v>
<v Speaker 2>summation of our choices.</v>

1697
01:21:54.340 --> 01:21:56.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really about like what we choose to</v>

1698
01:21:56.451 --> 01:22:00.650
<v Speaker 2>be and harnessing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that element of like I'm going to choose</v>

1699
01:22:00.651 --> 01:22:04.010
<v Speaker 2>to be someone who loves someone who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who does good and brings out</v>

1700
01:22:04.011 --> 01:22:05.570
<v Speaker 2>into the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

1701
01:22:05.630 --> 01:22:09.650
<v Speaker 2>we're in that kind of morphic field is</v>
<v Speaker 2>rupert sheldrick would say in that</v>

1702
01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:13.640
<v Speaker 2>capability of man is all the evil and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the good,</v>

1703
01:22:13.670 --> 01:22:16.580
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the protector as well as the destroyer.</v>

1704
01:22:16.581 --> 01:22:19.970
<v Speaker 2>I mean all of these elements are within</v>
<v Speaker 2>the human psyche.</v>

1705
01:22:20.270 --> 01:22:24.200
<v Speaker 2>And really I think the key is just to</v>
<v Speaker 2>reconcile that and to forgive that.</v>

1706
01:22:24.201 --> 01:22:24.921
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1707
01:22:24.921 --> 01:22:26.960
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's some fucked up animal parts of</v>

1708
01:22:26.961 --> 01:22:27.920
<v Speaker 2>me that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1709
01:22:27.980 --> 01:22:30.470
<v Speaker 2>get a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get sexually aroused in certain</v>

1710
01:22:30.471 --> 01:22:34.760
<v Speaker 2>situations that you shouldn't get</v>
<v Speaker 2>sexually aroused in that get attracted</v>

1711
01:22:34.761 --> 01:22:38.240
<v Speaker 2>to violent situations when that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually hurting somebody and just</v>

1712
01:22:38.241 --> 01:22:41.270
<v Speaker 2>reconcile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm going to choose not to indulge</v>

1713
01:22:41.271 --> 01:22:44.060
<v Speaker 2>any of those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's a part of humanity,</v>

1714
01:22:44.090 --> 01:22:48.260
<v Speaker 2>like the darkness is a part of all of us</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think that's like a key</v>

1715
01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:51.590
<v Speaker 2>recognition and it's enough to just</v>
<v Speaker 2>choose the light,</v>

1716
01:22:51.620 --> 01:22:54.050
<v Speaker 2>to choose love and to choose to be who</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to be.</v>

1717
01:22:54.550 --> 01:22:59.550
<v Speaker 3>I think we're also dealing with a world</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is so complex and so fucked up in</v>

1718
01:23:01.001 --> 01:23:06.001
<v Speaker 3>so many different ways that to expect</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone to be balanced and perfect and</v>

1719
01:23:07.091 --> 01:23:12.091
<v Speaker 3>healthy is kind of insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Expect someone to be completely free of</v>

1720
01:23:12.281 --> 01:23:17.281
<v Speaker 3>any bizarre thoughts or ideas is</v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous because we are a product or</v>

1721
01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:21.340
<v Speaker 3>at least we are influenced by the world</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we live in,</v>

1722
01:23:21.610 --> 01:23:23.530
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In the world that we live in is insanely</v>

1723
01:23:23.531 --> 01:23:26.320
<v Speaker 3>chaotic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Recognizing that and talking to that</v>

1724
01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:31.740
<v Speaker 3>about that is a big part of the steps</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's going to take to improve whatever</v>

1725
01:23:32.590 --> 01:23:34.930
<v Speaker 3>society is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However we define it,</v>

1726
01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:37.480
<v Speaker 3>whatever civilization is right now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's gonna.</v>

1727
01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:41.770
<v Speaker 3>There's gonna have to be steps that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>taken in order to make it better and you</v>

1728
01:23:41.771 --> 01:23:43.750
<v Speaker 3>got to kind of recognize that you're in</v>
<v Speaker 3>chaos.</v>

1729
01:23:44.170 --> 01:23:47.950
<v Speaker 3>Even if we're going to die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1730
01:23:47.951 --> 01:23:51.550
<v Speaker 3>this is gonna end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it'll stop and then new people will deal</v>

1731
01:23:51.551 --> 01:23:54.460
<v Speaker 3>with the same questions that we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>dealing with now and hopefully we were</v>

1732
01:23:54.461 --> 01:23:59.461
<v Speaker 3>honest about our experiences so that</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can gain some information without</v>

1733
01:24:00.341 --> 01:24:04.360
<v Speaker 3>having to go through those same mistakes</v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves and that's part of what</v>

1734
01:24:04.361 --> 01:24:05.350
<v Speaker 3>inspiration is.</v>

1735
01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:08.350
<v Speaker 3>It's part of what reading biographies</v>
<v Speaker 3>were all about.</v>

1736
01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:12.880
<v Speaker 3>That's part of what talking to people</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are wise and ancient and you know,</v>

1737
01:24:12.910 --> 01:24:14.280
<v Speaker 3>unlike clinics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would they.</v>

1738
01:24:14.440 --> 01:24:16.170
<v Speaker 3>They have some real like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1739
01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:17.740
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1740
01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:20.350
<v Speaker 3>Stanley Kripner.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can talk to some really old people</v>

1741
01:24:20.351 --> 01:24:25.351
<v Speaker 3>who are really knowledgeable that have</v>
<v Speaker 3>experienced some bizarre moments in life</v>

1742
01:24:25.601 --> 01:24:29.110
<v Speaker 3>and that have come through the other end</v>
<v Speaker 3>with some lessons and I think that</v>

1743
01:24:30.700 --> 01:24:35.700
<v Speaker 3>what we're dealing with is a society and</v>
<v Speaker 3>a civilization.</v>

1744
01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:40.330
<v Speaker 3>What would human culture is today?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this thing that's becoming awake?</v>

1745
01:24:40.750 --> 01:24:42.640
<v Speaker 3>It's going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why are we doing this?</v>

1746
01:24:42.670 --> 01:24:47.170
<v Speaker 3>Like when we're looking at what we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>seeing on television in terms of these</v>

1747
01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:49.840
<v Speaker 3>debates that we're talking about there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so preposterous.</v>

1748
01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:50.741
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're there.</v>

1749
01:24:50.741 --> 01:24:54.900
<v Speaker 3>They're carrying the momentum of decades</v>
<v Speaker 3>and decades of similar debates that</v>

1750
01:24:54.901 --> 01:24:56.980
<v Speaker 3>they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They feel like this is how they have to</v>

1751
01:24:56.981 --> 01:24:59.260
<v Speaker 3>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you watch the evening news,</v>

1752
01:24:59.470 --> 01:25:04.300
<v Speaker 3>what you're watching is the evening news</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the momentum of the decades of</v>

1753
01:25:04.301 --> 01:25:07.210
<v Speaker 3>evening news,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the expectations that people have.</v>

1754
01:25:07.630 --> 01:25:10.090
<v Speaker 3>If it bleeds,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it leads and these things have always</v>

1755
01:25:10.091 --> 01:25:14.350
<v Speaker 3>been this way and it's to change that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It takes a long ass time,</v>

1756
01:25:14.590 --> 01:25:19.120
<v Speaker 3>but if you watch the evening news today</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you watched the evening news from</v>

1757
01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:21.550
<v Speaker 3>1930,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it is a fucking different.</v>

1758
01:25:21.820 --> 01:25:26.140
<v Speaker 3>Humans are different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you watch the way people talk from</v>

1759
01:25:26.141 --> 01:25:28.350
<v Speaker 3>then and the way people talk today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you.</v>

1760
01:25:28.410 --> 01:25:33.040
<v Speaker 3>If you look at movies or music or media,</v>
<v Speaker 3>things have become more complex and more</v>

1761
01:25:33.041 --> 01:25:38.041
<v Speaker 3>honest and I think culture is becoming</v>
<v Speaker 3>way more aware of these complexities and</v>

1762
01:25:38.891 --> 01:25:43.891
<v Speaker 3>the importance of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Honesty in art are attempts to decipher</v>

1763
01:25:44.051 --> 01:25:47.590
<v Speaker 3>what it means to be alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are attempts to decipher what it</v>

1764
01:25:47.591 --> 01:25:51.100
<v Speaker 3>means to be a person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is the most harmonic way?</v>

1765
01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:52.040
<v Speaker 3>What where,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where?</v>

1766
01:25:52.090 --> 01:25:56.110
<v Speaker 3>How can you get through with harmonious</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the most harmonious way to get</v>

1767
01:25:56.111 --> 01:25:57.190
<v Speaker 3>through this experience?</v>

1768
01:25:57.370 --> 01:26:01.870
<v Speaker 3>What's the way to make the least amount</v>
<v Speaker 3>of mistakes and create the most amount</v>

1769
01:26:01.871 --> 01:26:05.810
<v Speaker 3>of happiness and have the most amount of</v>
<v Speaker 3>friends happy as well,</v>

1770
01:26:05.811 --> 01:26:09.440
<v Speaker 3>and what is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how is there a zero clear way?</v>

1771
01:26:09.441 --> 01:26:12.800
<v Speaker 3>No is a trial and error thing that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going on.</v>

1772
01:26:12.801 --> 01:26:17.540
<v Speaker 3>There's a failure and success.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lessons learned sort of thing</v>

1773
01:26:17.541 --> 01:26:19.970
<v Speaker 3>that's going on and it's not just going</v>
<v Speaker 3>on with you.</v>

1774
01:26:20.150 --> 01:26:22.570
<v Speaker 3>It's not just going on with United</v>
<v Speaker 3>States of America.</v>

1775
01:26:22.571 --> 01:26:26.690
<v Speaker 3>It's going on with the entirety of</v>
<v Speaker 3>humans on the planet earth.</v>

1776
01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:30.770
<v Speaker 3>There's a learning thing and it's based</v>
<v Speaker 3>on how much data we're taking in and the</v>

1777
01:26:30.771 --> 01:26:33.500
<v Speaker 3>data were taken today is radically</v>
<v Speaker 3>increased.</v>

1778
01:26:33.710 --> 01:26:37.160
<v Speaker 3>There's so much more data than at any</v>
<v Speaker 3>other time in history that we're almost</v>

1779
01:26:37.161 --> 01:26:40.610
<v Speaker 3>overwhelmed by it to the point where you</v>
<v Speaker 3>just want to concentrate on gossip.</v>

1780
01:26:40.850 --> 01:26:42.770
<v Speaker 3>He just want to concentrate on fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>distraction.</v>

1781
01:26:42.771 --> 01:26:44.420
<v Speaker 3>Meek mill and drake beefing.</v>

1782
01:26:44.630 --> 01:26:45.620
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's shit.</v>

1783
01:26:45.621 --> 01:26:47.510
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't mean anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but why?</v>

1784
01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:50.930
<v Speaker 3>Because is this almost in a lot of those</v>
<v Speaker 3>cases,</v>

1785
01:26:51.620 --> 01:26:55.160
<v Speaker 3>there's comfort in the simplicity of an</v>
<v Speaker 3>affair.</v>

1786
01:26:55.520 --> 01:27:00.170
<v Speaker 3>There's comfort in the simplicity of a</v>
<v Speaker 3>two dudes that are going to fight and be</v>

1787
01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:02.840
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was watching some video of the game,</v>

1788
01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:07.960
<v Speaker 3>the rapper beaten up some other APP.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First of all to that dude needs to learn</v>

1789
01:27:08.391 --> 01:27:12.230
<v Speaker 3>how to fight both of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking horrible to watch it's shitty</v>

1790
01:27:12.231 --> 01:27:15.200
<v Speaker 3>technique as a commentator.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was appalled,</v>

1791
01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:18.560
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something adorable about</v>

1792
01:27:18.561 --> 01:27:23.210
<v Speaker 3>watching some really like clear</v>
<v Speaker 3>conflict,</v>

1793
01:27:23.211 --> 01:27:26.060
<v Speaker 3>really obvious stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1794
01:27:26.110 --> 01:27:29.390
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it takes you away from the complexities.</v>

1795
01:27:29.810 --> 01:27:34.250
<v Speaker 3>It takes you away from the ambiguity of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the great picture where the great</v>

1796
01:27:34.251 --> 01:27:38.840
<v Speaker 3>picture I think is about information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's about information and,</v>

1797
01:27:38.900 --> 01:27:41.700
<v Speaker 3>and figuring out how to apply that in</v>
<v Speaker 3>good information.</v>

1798
01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:43.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and my,</v>

1799
01:27:43.440 --> 01:27:46.830
<v Speaker 2>one of my favorite ways to get</v>
<v Speaker 2>information is just experientially.</v>

1800
01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:47.670
<v Speaker 2>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1801
01:27:47.670 --> 01:27:50.550
<v Speaker 2>that's been part of my path is like</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out,</v>

1802
01:27:50.970 --> 01:27:53.880
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go deep within your own psyche and get</v>

1803
01:27:53.881 --> 01:27:55.140
<v Speaker 2>that information out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1804
01:27:55.200 --> 01:27:58.410
<v Speaker 2>not just the external information about</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that are going on in the world</v>

1805
01:27:58.411 --> 01:27:59.970
<v Speaker 2>and these new structures that are in</v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

1806
01:27:59.971 --> 01:28:02.060
<v Speaker 2>But like learn yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1807
01:28:02.070 --> 01:28:06.360
<v Speaker 2>learn about your own desires and</v>
<v Speaker 2>weaknesses and fears and demons and</v>

1808
01:28:06.361 --> 01:28:08.100
<v Speaker 2>these things that'll come up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1809
01:28:08.101 --> 01:28:11.490
<v Speaker 2>I remember I was in isolation for a</v>
<v Speaker 2>month and I was doing a,</v>

1810
01:28:11.820 --> 01:28:14.940
<v Speaker 2>what's called a [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a kind of a shamonic</v>

1811
01:28:14.941 --> 01:28:16.260
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to try.</v>

1812
01:28:16.261 --> 01:28:18.990
<v Speaker 2>I was going to write my book anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so made sense,</v>

1813
01:28:18.991 --> 01:28:22.680
<v Speaker 2>but I was basically meditating every</v>
<v Speaker 2>night and with that clarity of</v>

1814
01:28:22.681 --> 01:28:25.290
<v Speaker 2>meditating every night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is something I don't usually do.</v>

1815
01:28:25.291 --> 01:28:27.090
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm kind of like feast or famine with</v>

1816
01:28:27.091 --> 01:28:28.590
<v Speaker 2>that meditation practice.</v>

1817
01:28:28.590 --> 01:28:32.760
<v Speaker 2>But for then I was meditating every</v>
<v Speaker 2>night and it started to shine a light on</v>

1818
01:28:32.761 --> 01:28:34.890
<v Speaker 2>a lot of different aspects of myself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

1819
01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:36.570
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no plants involved at all.</v>

1820
01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:38.400
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I started to see,</v>

1821
01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:40.710
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even little tendencies that I could,</v>

1822
01:28:41.190 --> 01:28:44.640
<v Speaker 2>that I could cure that would come to me</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my own imagination.</v>

1823
01:28:44.641 --> 01:28:48.600
<v Speaker 2>Like I remember I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in a fight with Whitney and I was,</v>

1824
01:28:48.630 --> 01:28:49.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really,</v>

1825
01:28:49.410 --> 01:28:53.340
<v Speaker 2>really mad at her and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't say anything mean or call her a</v>

1826
01:28:53.341 --> 01:28:55.920
<v Speaker 2>bitch or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I would like wasn't returning our</v>

1827
01:28:55.921 --> 01:28:57.030
<v Speaker 2>calls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1828
01:28:57.090 --> 01:29:00.480
<v Speaker 2>And I knew kind of that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was hurting her for sure,</v>

1829
01:29:00.510 --> 01:29:03.560
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't about it like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to answer that call she</v>

1830
01:29:03.570 --> 01:29:07.260
<v Speaker 2>can do with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I go into my meditation and I</v>

1831
01:29:07.261 --> 01:29:11.760
<v Speaker 2>start seeing this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this image come up of this gorilla</v>

1832
01:29:11.761 --> 01:29:16.680
<v Speaker 2>with these big old horns and she's</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking this stock of stock of roses and</v>

1833
01:29:16.681 --> 01:29:19.260
<v Speaker 2>it's hitting Whitney with the stock of</v>
<v Speaker 2>roses,</v>

1834
01:29:19.290 --> 01:29:20.640
<v Speaker 2>like the thorny part.</v>

1835
01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:23.220
<v Speaker 2>And I'm thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is this?</v>

1836
01:29:23.221 --> 01:29:26.580
<v Speaker 2>Why is this in my imagination here as</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing this meditation?</v>

1837
01:29:26.581 --> 01:29:31.260
<v Speaker 2>Then I was thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was intentionally not talking to her</v>

1838
01:29:31.261 --> 01:29:33.110
<v Speaker 2>because I knew it would hurt her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1839
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:36.350
<v Speaker 2>but to me it was like my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my mind was saying like,</v>

1840
01:29:36.540 --> 01:29:38.340
<v Speaker 2>as long as you don't say anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're cool man,</v>

1841
01:29:38.341 --> 01:29:39.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all good,</v>

1842
01:29:39.870 --> 01:29:42.240
<v Speaker 2>but just shined a little light and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1843
01:29:42.241 --> 01:29:46.800
<v Speaker 2>it's not cool under any circumstance to</v>
<v Speaker 2>intentionally hurt somebody you love.</v>

1844
01:29:46.830 --> 01:29:48.750
<v Speaker 2>Even if it's just being quiet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1845
01:29:48.751 --> 01:29:52.140
<v Speaker 2>like that's fucked up too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you get these little pieces of</v>

1846
01:29:52.141 --> 01:29:55.910
<v Speaker 2>information where now all the sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what I thought was like</v>

1847
01:29:56.310 --> 01:29:59.010
<v Speaker 2>unacceptable behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh you just go quiet.</v>

1848
01:29:59.011 --> 01:30:00.900
<v Speaker 2>That's acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not being mean,</v>

1849
01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:02.070
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

1850
01:30:02.071 --> 01:30:02.311
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1851
01:30:02.311 --> 01:30:04.260
<v Speaker 2>That is mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is kind of fucked up because you're</v>

1852
01:30:04.261 --> 01:30:06.870
<v Speaker 2>withdrawing your love and you're hurting</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody.</v>

1853
01:30:06.871 --> 01:30:11.130
<v Speaker 2>So these little like course corrections</v>
<v Speaker 2>that can come from the knowledge of</v>

1854
01:30:11.430 --> 01:30:14.160
<v Speaker 2>going within.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's one of the most important</v>

1855
01:30:14.161 --> 01:30:17.970
<v Speaker 2>things we can do as well as absorbing</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the knowledge externally.</v>

1856
01:30:17.971 --> 01:30:21.360
<v Speaker 2>Like put as much focus on the inside as</v>
<v Speaker 2>the outside.</v>

1857
01:30:21.710 --> 01:30:22.431
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most people,</v>

1858
01:30:22.431 --> 01:30:25.250
<v Speaker 3>when they get involved in any sort of an</v>
<v Speaker 3>argument with somebody,</v>

1859
01:30:26.060 --> 01:30:28.280
<v Speaker 3>they immediately start shoring up their</v>
<v Speaker 3>defense,</v>

1860
01:30:28.490 --> 01:30:29.360
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck her,</v>

1861
01:30:29.361 --> 01:30:32.060
<v Speaker 3>I told her this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you have this whole like,</v>

1862
01:30:32.240 --> 01:30:35.150
<v Speaker 3>you have these walls set up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have your armor meant you have</v>

1863
01:30:35.151 --> 01:30:36.260
<v Speaker 3>every,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all your weapons.</v>

1864
01:30:36.261 --> 01:30:39.020
<v Speaker 3>If she says anything about that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to bring up the time.</v>

1865
01:30:39.021 --> 01:30:42.530
<v Speaker 3>She fucking did this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's why it's so frustrating for</v>

1866
01:30:42.531 --> 01:30:44.780
<v Speaker 3>people when they have a conversation</v>
<v Speaker 3>about something like,</v>

1867
01:30:44.810 --> 01:30:45.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

1868
01:30:45.651 --> 01:30:47.510
<v Speaker 3>how come you didn't put gas in the car?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1869
01:30:47.511 --> 01:30:49.490
<v Speaker 3>you said you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fucking dropped the car off and I'm</v>

1870
01:30:49.491 --> 01:30:51.320
<v Speaker 3>fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now I've got to find a gas station.</v>

1871
01:30:51.500 --> 01:30:52.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well you know,</v>

1872
01:30:52.341 --> 01:30:55.490
<v Speaker 3>you should have done this last week when</v>
<v Speaker 3>my friend came over and you told her</v>

1873
01:30:55.660 --> 01:30:57.020
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what does that have to do with anything?</v>

1874
01:30:57.200 --> 01:31:02.200
<v Speaker 3>Just always built up resentment and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>built in defense and instead of handling</v>

1875
01:31:03.351 --> 01:31:08.351
<v Speaker 3>that situation like I remember dating</v>
<v Speaker 3>girls in the past that you could never</v>

1876
01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:12.590
<v Speaker 3>talk to them about something because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would bring up some other shit that</v>

1877
01:31:12.591 --> 01:31:16.760
<v Speaker 3>was completely nonrelated and not even</v>
<v Speaker 3>address what you're talking about.</v>

1878
01:31:17.060 --> 01:31:19.820
<v Speaker 3>They would just talk about some other</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing that happened a month ago or six</v>

1879
01:31:19.821 --> 01:31:21.690
<v Speaker 3>months ago or a year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

1880
01:31:21.710 --> 01:31:22.740
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1881
01:31:22.850 --> 01:31:24.920
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not going to happen.</v>

1882
01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:26.180
<v Speaker 3>We can't do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>

1883
01:31:26.181 --> 01:31:28.880
<v Speaker 3>You can't talk about the like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what will you need to fucking admit the</v>

1884
01:31:28.881 --> 01:31:29.714
<v Speaker 3>fact that you did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That</v>

1885
01:31:31.260 --> 01:31:32.540
<v Speaker 3>has nothing to do with what we're</v>
<v Speaker 3>saying.</v>

1886
01:31:32.590 --> 01:31:33.860
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing to do with what we're saying,</v>

1887
01:31:33.861 --> 01:31:37.430
<v Speaker 3>but they've got their defense shored up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've got their walls up,</v>

1888
01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:40.730
<v Speaker 3>they got their weapons and they're ready</v>
<v Speaker 3>to fucking go to war and that's what it</v>

1889
01:31:40.731 --> 01:31:41.300
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

1890
01:31:41.300 --> 01:31:43.730
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it's so easy to get stuck in these</v>

1891
01:31:43.731 --> 01:31:46.010
<v Speaker 3>kinds of mine because the ego wants to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be right.</v>

1892
01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:50.240
<v Speaker 3>The Ego wants to be superior.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Ego's first line always is how dare</v>

1893
01:31:50.241 --> 01:31:52.190
<v Speaker 3>you and you want to win.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You want to win too.</v>

1894
01:31:52.191 --> 01:31:54.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you don't believe that you're beyond</v>

1895
01:31:54.921 --> 01:31:56.330
<v Speaker 3>reproach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even if you don't believe you're</v>

1896
01:31:56.331 --> 01:32:01.030
<v Speaker 3>innocent though this is a fucking game</v>
<v Speaker 3>of and you want to figure out how to get</v>

1897
01:32:01.031 --> 01:32:02.380
<v Speaker 3>that king knocked over.</v>

1898
01:32:02.470 --> 01:32:04.150
<v Speaker 3>You want to get to checkmate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

1899
01:32:04.330 --> 01:32:05.163
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's.</v>

1900
01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:09.720
<v Speaker 3>It's definitely the sticky little trap.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whereas when you find yourself in that,</v>

1901
01:32:09.721 --> 01:32:12.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the solution has actually let the mind</v>

1902
01:32:12.491 --> 01:32:15.760
<v Speaker 3>with all of its manifestations go and</v>
<v Speaker 3>just focus back to the heart.</v>

1903
01:32:16.150 --> 01:32:19.720
<v Speaker 3>Focus back to those truths,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the platinum rule that we talked</v>

1904
01:32:19.721 --> 01:32:21.040
<v Speaker 3>about like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1905
01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:23.710
<v Speaker 3>that's another me living a different</v>
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

1906
01:32:23.740 --> 01:32:27.940
<v Speaker 3>Like that's not fucking crushed them and</v>
<v Speaker 3>when and hurt them.</v>

1907
01:32:28.180 --> 01:32:32.770
<v Speaker 3>Let's just see what's best for the good</v>
<v Speaker 3>of both of us and like take it back to</v>

1908
01:32:32.771 --> 01:32:37.771
<v Speaker 3>that simpler kind of slower truth that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we find like deep within our own</v>

1909
01:32:38.111 --> 01:32:41.890
<v Speaker 3>consciousness inside our heart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's also a reality that some</v>

1910
01:32:41.891 --> 01:32:45.490
<v Speaker 3>people you got to let go because you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>not on the same path as you and they</v>

1911
01:32:45.491 --> 01:32:47.830
<v Speaker 3>will drag you down with that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1912
01:32:47.831 --> 01:32:49.060
<v Speaker 3>you should have done this and blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

1913
01:32:49.061 --> 01:32:49.301
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>

1914
01:32:49.301 --> 01:32:49.950
<v Speaker 3>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blah.</v>

1915
01:32:49.950 --> 01:32:53.140
<v Speaker 3>There's some people that were will</v>
<v Speaker 3>always be in conflict,</v>

1916
01:32:53.141 --> 01:32:55.280
<v Speaker 3>are always going to be fucking up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're always gonna,</v>

1917
01:32:55.300 --> 01:32:59.380
<v Speaker 3>not pay their taxes and being this</v>
<v Speaker 3>constant state of fucking chaos.</v>

1918
01:32:59.620 --> 01:33:03.250
<v Speaker 3>They're always going to be caught lying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're always going to be doing this or</v>

1919
01:33:03.251 --> 01:33:07.810
<v Speaker 3>stealing or there's people that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to always do something wrong and</v>

1920
01:33:07.811 --> 01:33:11.080
<v Speaker 3>you can't keep them in your life because</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have to find their own path.</v>

1921
01:33:11.440 --> 01:33:14.980
<v Speaker 3>Even if that is you living another life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not helping them by enabling them</v>

1922
01:33:14.981 --> 01:33:18.610
<v Speaker 3>now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by continuing the cycle of like makeup,</v>

1923
01:33:18.820 --> 01:33:21.790
<v Speaker 3>like fight makeup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight makeup,</v>

1924
01:33:21.970 --> 01:33:25.780
<v Speaker 3>come to some acknowledgement within</v>
<v Speaker 3>denial afterwards,</v>

1925
01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:30.790
<v Speaker 3>you you will be caught in their own</v>
<v Speaker 3>conflict and that same sort of thing</v>

1926
01:33:30.791 --> 01:33:35.020
<v Speaker 3>where I said that the complexities of</v>
<v Speaker 3>life oftentimes lead us to pay attention</v>

1927
01:33:35.021 --> 01:33:38.060
<v Speaker 3>to simple,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stupid shit like you hear Kanye is going</v>

1928
01:33:38.061 --> 01:33:41.910
<v Speaker 3>to get divorced from Kim because Ron,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

1929
01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:42.520
<v Speaker 3>what is that?</v>

1930
01:33:42.520 --> 01:33:45.040
<v Speaker 3>It's like you're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're looking for some simple stupid,</v>

1931
01:33:45.100 --> 01:33:48.100
<v Speaker 3>clearly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>easily defined shit to distract you from</v>

1932
01:33:48.101 --> 01:33:50.230
<v Speaker 3>the complexities of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1933
01:33:50.231 --> 01:33:55.231
<v Speaker 3>if you get involved in a friendship with</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone that's really fucked up and,</v>

1934
01:33:55.990 --> 01:33:58.900
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>steals from you or just have some</v>

1935
01:33:59.620 --> 01:34:04.620
<v Speaker 3>horrible shit going on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that debt will take away from all the</v>

1936
01:34:04.691 --> 01:34:07.630
<v Speaker 3>other stuff that you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will become a massive part of your</v>

1937
01:34:07.631 --> 01:34:10.960
<v Speaker 3>life and that conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which may you may be completely</v>

1938
01:34:10.961 --> 01:34:12.910
<v Speaker 3>innocent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He might not have anything to do with</v>

1939
01:34:12.911 --> 01:34:14.800
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you're trapped with this person that</v>

1940
01:34:14.801 --> 01:34:18.210
<v Speaker 3>might have a drug addiction.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you have someone like for</v>

1941
01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:21.880
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of people that have family members</v>

1942
01:34:21.910 --> 01:34:24.760
<v Speaker 3>that are hooked on drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's insanely,</v>

1943
01:34:24.761 --> 01:34:26.980
<v Speaker 3>extremely frustrating because they'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

1944
01:34:27.460 --> 01:34:28.090
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1945
01:34:28.090 --> 01:34:32.050
<v Speaker 3>I know guys who have stolen from their</v>
<v Speaker 3>own mother to pay for their drug habits.</v>

1946
01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:34.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Could you imagine you have a child and</v>

1947
01:34:34.781 --> 01:34:39.781
<v Speaker 3>you raise your child and your child is</v>
<v Speaker 3>stealing from you to pay for drugs and</v>

1948
01:34:40.481 --> 01:34:42.140
<v Speaker 3>you're kind of in denial about it and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

1949
01:34:42.170 --> 01:34:45.070
<v Speaker 3>but you're trapped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're in this conflict with this person</v>

1950
01:34:45.370 --> 01:34:48.280
<v Speaker 3>and there's almost no way in your mind</v>
<v Speaker 3>to fix it,</v>

1951
01:34:48.330 --> 01:34:50.530
<v Speaker 3>to make it better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it becomes your life.</v>

1952
01:34:50.890 --> 01:34:52.280
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you have a child and your child</v>

1953
01:34:52.780 --> 01:34:55.540
<v Speaker 3>constantly in and out of jail and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1954
01:34:55.541 --> 01:34:58.040
<v Speaker 3>fucking up and doing horrible things,</v>

1955
01:34:58.040 --> 01:35:01.520
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you become trapped by that relationship</v>

1956
01:35:01.521 --> 01:35:02.910
<v Speaker 2>that you have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have,</v>

1957
01:35:02.990 --> 01:35:06.140
<v Speaker 2>you have a right to your own happiness</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we got to make sure that you protect</v>

1958
01:35:06.141 --> 01:35:07.100
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1959
01:35:07.101 --> 01:35:10.370
<v Speaker 2>and these people who are living on</v>
<v Speaker 2>compulsion,</v>

1960
01:35:10.371 --> 01:35:13.130
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like they've forgotten their</v>
<v Speaker 2>forgone,</v>

1961
01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:16.610
<v Speaker 2>their right to choose their ability to</v>
<v Speaker 2>choose their compulsion.</v>

1962
01:35:16.611 --> 01:35:20.300
<v Speaker 2>It's compulsion for more drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's compulsion for more emotional</v>

1963
01:35:20.780 --> 01:35:23.600
<v Speaker 2>turbulence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's compulsion for needing something</v>

1964
01:35:23.601 --> 01:35:26.630
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those people are naturally like the</v>

1965
01:35:26.631 --> 01:35:30.110
<v Speaker 2>hardest to be around because they don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>have that stillness where they can,</v>

1966
01:35:30.500 --> 01:35:32.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of wrangle their ability to choose,</v>

1967
01:35:32.961 --> 01:35:34.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me like choices,</v>

1968
01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:36.260
<v Speaker 2>like breath,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's going to happen no matter</v>

1969
01:35:36.261 --> 01:35:38.240
<v Speaker 2>what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to make decisions no matter</v>

1970
01:35:38.241 --> 01:35:39.860
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like we're going to breathe no</v>

1971
01:35:39.861 --> 01:35:43.340
<v Speaker 2>matter what you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then there's also the ability to</v>

1972
01:35:43.341 --> 01:35:45.850
<v Speaker 2>wrangle your choice and decide how you</v>
<v Speaker 2>breathe.</v>

1973
01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:48.530
<v Speaker 2>Maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>deep breath,</v>

1974
01:35:48.531 --> 01:35:52.910
<v Speaker 2>you take control and you actually can</v>
<v Speaker 2>maneuver with that choice and actually</v>

1975
01:35:52.911 --> 01:35:55.980
<v Speaker 2>start to make reasonable decisions of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1976
01:35:56.050 --> 01:36:00.800
<v Speaker 2>acting on your own volition rather than</v>
<v Speaker 2>compulsion and getting people around you</v>

1977
01:36:00.801 --> 01:36:05.120
<v Speaker 2>who are also able to do that is so key</v>
<v Speaker 2>because then you can actually have some</v>

1978
01:36:05.121 --> 01:36:09.860
<v Speaker 2>freedom to make decisions and to build</v>
<v Speaker 2>cool shit or to explore cool things or</v>

1979
01:36:09.861 --> 01:36:10.780
<v Speaker 2>have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1980
01:36:10.790 --> 01:36:13.580
<v Speaker 2>have a lot of fun and those are the</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that I think are going to be the</v>

1981
01:36:13.581 --> 01:36:15.200
<v Speaker 2>most beneficial to be around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1982
01:36:15.201 --> 01:36:19.640
<v Speaker 2>And also you build momentum together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing about having friends</v>

1983
01:36:19.641 --> 01:36:24.641
<v Speaker 2>that are like really happy and fun and</v>
<v Speaker 2>warm and,</v>

1984
01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.950
<v Speaker 2>and doing what they want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when I have friends that are</v>

1985
01:36:27.951 --> 01:36:30.290
<v Speaker 2>successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it makes me excited about success.</v>

1986
01:36:30.710 --> 01:36:33.650
<v Speaker 2>If I have friends that are involved in</v>
<v Speaker 2>good things,</v>

1987
01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:34.880
<v Speaker 2>everything's going great.</v>

1988
01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:38.210
<v Speaker 2>It gets me excited about doing more</v>
<v Speaker 2>myself,</v>

1989
01:36:38.240 --> 01:36:41.750
<v Speaker 2>getting more good shit done,</v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoying life more.</v>

1990
01:36:41.751 --> 01:36:45.340
<v Speaker 2>And then when you spend time together</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's all this fun and laughter and</v>

1991
01:36:45.341 --> 01:36:49.310
<v Speaker 2>it's like good times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whereas if you're involved in these</v>

1992
01:36:49.311 --> 01:36:54.290
<v Speaker 2>negative patterns and these patterns of</v>
<v Speaker 2>like constant chaos and mistakes and</v>

1993
01:36:54.291 --> 01:36:58.250
<v Speaker 2>deception and Horse Shit and addiction</v>
<v Speaker 2>or whatever the fuck it is,</v>

1994
01:36:58.460 --> 01:37:02.690
<v Speaker 2>those patterns seem to just be overwhelm</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything else in life.</v>

1995
01:37:03.020 --> 01:37:05.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the most impactful things that I</v>

1996
01:37:05.421 --> 01:37:09.860
<v Speaker 2>did last year was I went on that summit</v>
<v Speaker 2>at sea cruise and I thought it was not</v>

1997
01:37:09.880 --> 01:37:12.080
<v Speaker 2>going to be that cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what was the most cool part?</v>

1998
01:37:12.081 --> 01:37:13.860
<v Speaker 2>There was some great speeches,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some good content.</v>

1999
01:37:13.861 --> 01:37:15.140
<v Speaker 2>Is it what is summit?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so.</v>

2000
01:37:15.141 --> 01:37:18.590
<v Speaker 2>It's like a curated group of</v>
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurs,</v>

2001
01:37:19.730 --> 01:37:21.110
<v Speaker 2>thought leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>musicians,</v>

2002
01:37:21.111 --> 01:37:22.790
<v Speaker 2>artists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different people who have.</v>

2003
01:37:22.791 --> 01:37:27.050
<v Speaker 2>They've invited to come basically hang</v>
<v Speaker 2>out for a little while and interact and</v>

2004
01:37:27.051 --> 01:37:29.030
<v Speaker 2>so there's some speeches and people give</v>
<v Speaker 2>content.</v>

2005
01:37:29.031 --> 01:37:34.031
<v Speaker 2>There was the CEO of Uber and a Schmidt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ex ceo of Google and there was a</v>

2006
01:37:34.971 --> 01:37:36.500
<v Speaker 2>bunch of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bob Pittman was there,</v>

2007
01:37:36.510 --> 01:37:39.930
<v Speaker 2>gave a great speech and Shep Gordon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the famous music agent.</v>

2008
01:37:39.931 --> 01:37:43.850
<v Speaker 2>So a lot of like bigger names.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are giving speeches and doing their</v>

2009
01:37:43.851 --> 01:37:46.490
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's just the general guest lists</v>

2010
01:37:46.491 --> 01:37:49.160
<v Speaker 2>with people who were somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2011
01:37:49.161 --> 01:37:52.880
<v Speaker 2>doing something cool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what the effect was is having 2,500</v>

2012
01:37:52.881 --> 01:37:56.400
<v Speaker 2>people who generally all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody there</v>

2013
01:37:56.640 --> 01:38:00.150
<v Speaker 1>had the attitude of we can do anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can totally do anything.</v>

2014
01:38:00.210 --> 01:38:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Like anything is possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like just the effect of being surrounded</v>

2015
01:38:04.440 --> 01:38:09.440
<v Speaker 1>by 2,500 people who all believed that</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything was possible was just fucking</v>

2016
01:38:10.081 --> 01:38:12.660
<v Speaker 1>super inspiring because you never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you never,</v>

2017
01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:15.720
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aggregate that many people who feel like</v>

2018
01:38:15.721 --> 01:38:17.970
<v Speaker 1>that those are the anomalies and most</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are like,</v>

2019
01:38:17.971 --> 01:38:20.080
<v Speaker 1>oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fml,</v>

2020
01:38:20.130 --> 01:38:21.300
<v Speaker 1>this fucking sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2021
01:38:21.301 --> 01:38:24.060
<v Speaker 1>you get a good mix of both of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

2022
01:38:24.061 --> 01:38:27.820
<v Speaker 1>the inspiring people and the people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>were kind of bummed out and that's</v>

2023
01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:31.230
<v Speaker 1>fucked my life for people going</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so,</v>

2024
01:38:31.410 --> 01:38:33.670
<v Speaker 1>but being on the boat like everybody</v>
<v Speaker 1>believing like,</v>

2025
01:38:33.671 --> 01:38:34.890
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything's possible.</v>

2026
01:38:34.891 --> 01:38:36.390
<v Speaker 1>What are we going to create?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How are we going to do this?</v>

2027
01:38:36.391 --> 01:38:37.950
<v Speaker 1>What's the social problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's this thing?</v>

2028
01:38:38.370 --> 01:38:40.890
<v Speaker 1>Just that alone was worth it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2029
01:38:40.891 --> 01:38:41.970
<v Speaker 1>to just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2030
01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:45.720
<v Speaker 1>that was fucking cool because your mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes in all of that.</v>

2031
01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:49.560
<v Speaker 1>You kind of like absorb it if that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that's the norm around you.</v>

2032
01:38:49.950 --> 01:38:51.470
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's a lot of people say that</v>

2033
01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:53.340
<v Speaker 1>you're the average of your five best</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>

2034
01:38:53.341 --> 01:38:57.000
<v Speaker 1>Like if that's the norm around you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start to believe that even more</v>

2035
01:38:57.001 --> 01:38:58.510
<v Speaker 1>strongly to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck yeah,</v>

2036
01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:00.810
<v Speaker 1>it's possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what do we want to do?</v>

2037
01:39:00.811 --> 01:39:02.100
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do we want to create?</v>

2038
01:39:02.190 --> 01:39:06.330
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that why being in a really</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrible neighborhood is so insidious,</v>

2039
01:39:06.420 --> 01:39:09.690
<v Speaker 1>like being born and raised in a horrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood is so insidious because</v>

2040
01:39:09.691 --> 01:39:12.180
<v Speaker 1>you're kind of trapped by your</v>
<v Speaker 1>environment a lot of ways,</v>

2041
01:39:12.270 --> 01:39:17.160
<v Speaker 1>but that's what one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that you know have that pull</v>

2042
01:39:17.161 --> 01:39:21.030
<v Speaker 1>yourself up by your bootstraps mentality</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't take into account.</v>

2043
01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:23.700
<v Speaker 1>It's like these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't see that.</v>

2044
01:39:23.730 --> 01:39:26.940
<v Speaker 1>Like where are they getting this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or you're asking them to build an</v>

2045
01:39:26.941 --> 01:39:31.320
<v Speaker 1>insane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>raging fire with nothing but wet trees</v>

2046
01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:33.690
<v Speaker 1>and to rocks to bank and stuff like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2047
01:39:33.750 --> 01:39:36.430
<v Speaker 1>Pull yourself up by your bootstraps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done it well,</v>

2048
01:39:36.450 --> 01:39:37.980
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had a fucking lighter.</v>

2049
01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:40.950
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you had newspapers and you had dry</v>

2050
01:39:40.951 --> 01:39:44.820
<v Speaker 1>wood and you had a fireplace in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful mansion and you were watching</v>

2051
01:39:44.821 --> 01:39:46.840
<v Speaker 1>people build fires your whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2052
01:39:47.510 --> 01:39:52.510
<v Speaker 1>and everybody knew how to build a fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this idea that everyone starts on a</v>

2053
01:39:53.071 --> 01:39:57.720
<v Speaker 1>level playing field and you just need to</v>
<v Speaker 1>escape from your environment because</v>

2054
01:39:57.721 --> 01:40:01.530
<v Speaker 1>you're ambitious and you know you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you only ambitious if you're allowed to</v>

2055
01:40:01.531 --> 01:40:06.210
<v Speaker 1>be ambitious like you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to have someone around you that</v>

2056
01:40:06.211 --> 01:40:10.080
<v Speaker 1>has some sense of difference that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some.</v>

2057
01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Something can be done that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is more,</v>

2058
01:40:14.370 --> 01:40:18.690
<v Speaker 1>more pleasurable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something can be done that is better.</v>

2059
01:40:18.691 --> 01:40:20.170
<v Speaker 1>You can improve upon your surrounding</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

2060
01:40:20.171 --> 01:40:22.350
<v Speaker 1>You have to see that if you don't see</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2061
01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:23.730
<v Speaker 1>you just assume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2062
01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:24.750
<v Speaker 1>this is how we live.</v>

2063
01:40:24.930 --> 01:40:28.950
<v Speaker 1>We scratch and claw where like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>chimps in the jungle that steal from</v>

2064
01:40:28.951 --> 01:40:30.630
<v Speaker 1>each other and beat each other over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>

2065
01:40:30.930 --> 01:40:34.530
<v Speaker 1>And then we're going to have to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out a way to survive.</v>

2066
01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:36.570
<v Speaker 1>And the way to survive is scratch and</v>
<v Speaker 1>claw.</v>

2067
01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in,</v>

2068
01:40:37.610 --> 01:40:42.610
<v Speaker 1>you know you live in some horrible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poor neighborhood and that's how it is.</v>

2069
01:40:42.691 --> 01:40:45.450
<v Speaker 1>Everybody is survival of the fittest</v>
<v Speaker 1>around you all the time,</v>

2070
01:40:45.451 --> 01:40:49.290
<v Speaker 1>all the scratching and clawing and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's your reality that you have to</v>

2071
01:40:49.291 --> 01:40:51.630
<v Speaker 1>adapt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to stay alive that way and</v>

2072
01:40:51.631 --> 01:40:54.010
<v Speaker 1>that's the dark ages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the inquisition.</v>

2073
01:40:54.011 --> 01:40:56.050
<v Speaker 1>That's like your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the environment you're in.</v>

2074
01:40:56.051 --> 01:40:59.380
<v Speaker 1>It's so hard to escape the environment</v>
<v Speaker 1>or to change it.</v>

2075
01:40:59.530 --> 01:41:04.530
<v Speaker 1>If you're stuck in a situation like</v>
<v Speaker 1>savior in like some isis occupied city</v>

2076
01:41:05.261 --> 01:41:06.370
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what?</v>

2077
01:41:06.480 --> 01:41:07.930
<v Speaker 1>What are you going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think positive.</v>

2078
01:41:07.950 --> 01:41:08.500
<v Speaker 1>What are you going do?</v>

2079
01:41:08.500 --> 01:41:11.020
<v Speaker 1>Go to yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fuck are you going to do you know</v>

2080
01:41:11.021 --> 01:41:11.854
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to.</v>

2081
01:41:12.310 --> 01:41:17.310
<v Speaker 1>Reality is a motherfucker and you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to accept the situation that you're</v>

2082
01:41:17.501 --> 01:41:18.760
<v Speaker 1>presented with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you,</v>

2083
01:41:18.790 --> 01:41:21.970
<v Speaker 1>if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this idea that you could somehow or</v>

2084
01:41:21.971 --> 01:41:26.971
<v Speaker 1>another rise above just simply by</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking positive and doing the right</v>

2085
01:41:28.361 --> 01:41:29.141
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well no,</v>

2086
01:41:29.141 --> 01:41:29.590
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>

2087
01:41:29.590 --> 01:41:33.010
<v Speaker 1>your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your situation is constant conflict.</v>

2088
01:41:33.011 --> 01:41:36.190
<v Speaker 1>You involved in that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless you can figure out some sort of a</v>

2089
01:41:36.191 --> 01:41:39.790
<v Speaker 1>way to end that across the board with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire country.</v>

2090
01:41:39.791 --> 01:41:40.860
<v Speaker 1>The entire world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2091
01:41:40.890 --> 01:41:42.610
<v Speaker 1>the planet earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of humanity.</v>

2092
01:41:42.790 --> 01:41:44.880
<v Speaker 1>We're always going to have issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're always,</v>

2093
01:41:45.250 --> 01:41:47.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are certain circumstances though</v>

2094
01:41:47.350 --> 01:41:51.880
<v Speaker 1>where that kind of external pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything being so fucked up,</v>

2095
01:41:52.250 --> 01:41:54.340
<v Speaker 1>we'll crack most people like you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

2096
01:41:54.341 --> 01:41:56.920
<v Speaker 1>but then they'll occasionally be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These diamonds are formed.</v>

2097
01:41:56.921 --> 01:41:59.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people who define themselves</v>

2098
01:41:59.231 --> 01:42:04.030
<v Speaker 1>against this horrible resistance around</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and because it was so hard for them</v>

2099
01:42:04.031 --> 01:42:06.730
<v Speaker 1>to build the fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to use that analogy with their wet ass</v>

2100
01:42:06.731 --> 01:42:10.780
<v Speaker 1>newspapers and these two flints and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've just been striking and striking</v>

2101
01:42:10.781 --> 01:42:12.730
<v Speaker 1>and striking when they actually do it.</v>

2102
01:42:12.770 --> 01:42:15.160
<v Speaker 1>Their skills that they bring to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>table,</v>

2103
01:42:15.161 --> 01:42:16.990
<v Speaker 1>they're the baddest motherfuckers</v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

2104
01:42:17.280 --> 01:42:22.200
<v Speaker 1>So occasionally it can create these</v>
<v Speaker 1>masterful human beings that are just</v>

2105
01:42:22.290 --> 01:42:25.570
<v Speaker 1>defined in greatness by their struggle</v>
<v Speaker 1>coming up.</v>

2106
01:42:25.571 --> 01:42:27.700
<v Speaker 1>And I think we all know a lot of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2107
01:42:27.701 --> 01:42:29.170
<v Speaker 1>You even,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think at one point said,</v>

2108
01:42:29.300 --> 01:42:31.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>show me the great man that's a son of a</v>

2109
01:42:31.241 --> 01:42:35.380
<v Speaker 1>great man because you know that you do</v>
<v Speaker 1>need some of this resistance to really</v>

2110
01:42:35.770 --> 01:42:40.030
<v Speaker 1>be as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as magnificent as you can possibly be in</v>

2111
01:42:40.031 --> 01:42:42.010
<v Speaker 1>a lot of circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

2112
01:42:42.011 --> 01:42:45.070
<v Speaker 1>in general it's hard because while</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be one diamond,</v>

2113
01:42:45.071 --> 01:42:46.020
<v Speaker 1>there'll be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2114
01:42:46.030 --> 01:42:49.750
<v Speaker 1>a thousand pieces of crushed call that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just the pressure of the</v>

2115
01:42:49.751 --> 01:42:53.470
<v Speaker 1>environment is not supportive for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>general population.</v>

2116
01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:55.300
<v Speaker 1>It's also like that movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2117
01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:57.590
<v Speaker 1>was that band movie where they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2118
01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:01.810
<v Speaker 1>there was that a composer who was trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get,</v>

2119
01:43:03.390 --> 01:43:05.890
<v Speaker 1>he was the state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the farmer's insurance guy who was</v>

2120
01:43:05.891 --> 01:43:08.650
<v Speaker 1>a composer and he won like Academy</v>
<v Speaker 1>Awards,</v>

2121
01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:09.970
<v Speaker 1>Farmer's insurance guy.</v>

2122
01:43:12.330 --> 01:43:14.200
<v Speaker 1>He was a fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember.</v>

2123
01:43:14.201 --> 01:43:15.410
<v Speaker 1>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>

2124
01:43:15.490 --> 01:43:17.900
<v Speaker 1>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a composer or like a,</v>

2125
01:43:18.010 --> 01:43:19.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2126
01:43:19.510 --> 01:43:22.630
<v Speaker 1>And he was basically taking one of his</v>
<v Speaker 1>students and he would,</v>

2127
01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:25.270
<v Speaker 1>he would take his students and he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the worst coach ever,</v>

2128
01:43:25.290 --> 01:43:30.290
<v Speaker 1>like just recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in whiplash,</v>

2129
01:43:30.370 --> 01:43:32.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the most brutal hours insurance</v>

2130
01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:35.200
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The guy from Oz.</v>

2131
01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:36.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the screamer.</v>

2132
01:43:36.870 --> 01:43:38.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he would have,</v>

2133
01:43:38.260 --> 01:43:41.020
<v Speaker 1>he died the most brutal methods for his</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole people.</v>

2134
01:43:41.021 --> 01:43:42.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're playing until their fingers were</v>

2135
01:43:42.791 --> 01:43:45.490
<v Speaker 1>bloody and he just basically broke</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody.</v>

2136
01:43:45.491 --> 01:43:48.670
<v Speaker 1>He broke everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what he was waiting for was that one</v>

2137
01:43:48.671 --> 01:43:50.290
<v Speaker 1>diamond to emerge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2138
01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:52.040
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of have that kind</v>

2139
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:53.960
<v Speaker 2>of mentality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like we'll break them down,</v>

2140
01:43:53.961 --> 01:43:56.660
<v Speaker 2>we'll break everybody and then there'll</v>
<v Speaker 2>be this greatness that comes.</v>

2141
01:43:57.110 --> 01:43:59.300
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really like super rare that that</v>

2142
01:43:59.301 --> 01:44:01.850
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And generally like not worth it,</v>

2143
01:44:02.060 --> 01:44:04.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like why not like have people enjoy</v>

2144
01:44:04.401 --> 01:44:07.280
<v Speaker 2>music and lead by inspiration instead of</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

2145
01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:11.660
<v Speaker 2>Let's just fucking break everybody and</v>
<v Speaker 2>hope that that one time you strike the</v>

2146
01:44:11.661 --> 01:44:14.690
<v Speaker 2>hammer down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't break and the hammer breaks</v>

2147
01:44:14.691 --> 01:44:17.180
<v Speaker 2>instead because you've actually struck a</v>
<v Speaker 2>diamond.</v>

2148
01:44:17.450 --> 01:44:21.380
<v Speaker 2>It's just kinda like weird ethos that I</v>
<v Speaker 2>think a lot of coaches and a lot of</v>

2149
01:44:21.381 --> 01:44:23.600
<v Speaker 2>people have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My High School basketball coach had that</v>

2150
01:44:23.601 --> 01:44:26.270
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he was willing to make the entire</v>

2151
01:44:26.271 --> 01:44:30.830
<v Speaker 2>basketball season miserable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely miserable in order to try and</v>

2152
01:44:30.831 --> 01:44:33.710
<v Speaker 2>get something out of the players,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which never happened.</v>

2153
01:44:33.711 --> 01:44:35.600
<v Speaker 2>We lost in the first round of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>playoffs,</v>

2154
01:44:35.601 --> 01:44:39.470
<v Speaker 2>no matter how highly ranked we were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because part of our motivation is just</v>

2155
01:44:39.471 --> 01:44:42.000
<v Speaker 2>to get the fucking season over because</v>
<v Speaker 2>we hated him.</v>

2156
01:44:43.690 --> 01:44:46.940
<v Speaker 2>Fucking hated him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we had like mixed motivations,</v>

2157
01:44:47.530 --> 01:44:49.970
<v Speaker 2>effective coach.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And an ineffective and so,</v>

2158
01:44:49.971 --> 01:44:52.640
<v Speaker 2>but there is that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You do create occasional diamonds with</v>

2159
01:44:52.641 --> 01:44:55.220
<v Speaker 2>pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for the most part it just crushes</v>

2160
01:44:55.221 --> 01:44:57.230
<v Speaker 2>most people and sometimes those</v>
<v Speaker 2>diamonds,</v>

2161
01:44:57.260 --> 01:44:59.270
<v Speaker 2>they become like a guy like Nelson</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mandela,</v>

2162
01:44:59.271 --> 01:45:03.740
<v Speaker 2>that sort of elevated entire culture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right in their King Nelson Mandela,</v>

2163
01:45:03.741 --> 01:45:07.400
<v Speaker 2>these different individuals who you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>were defined by this,</v>

2164
01:45:07.490 --> 01:45:09.920
<v Speaker 2>by this intensity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's not to say that it's a hopeless</v>

2165
01:45:09.921 --> 01:45:13.310
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can create the greatest of the great,</v>

2166
01:45:13.730 --> 01:45:16.310
<v Speaker 2>but it's going to be a real fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>challenge.</v>

2167
01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:18.140
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and for most people,</v>

2168
01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:22.700
<v Speaker 2>expecting those folks that are in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>environment to to behave the same way as</v>

2169
01:45:22.701 --> 01:45:24.920
<v Speaker 2>people that live in a gated community in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pasadena,</v>

2170
01:45:25.340 --> 01:45:29.570
<v Speaker 2>just it's completely unrealistic in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was the trump point.</v>

2171
01:45:29.930 --> 01:45:31.190
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>c'mon man,</v>

2172
01:45:31.191 --> 01:45:34.520
<v Speaker 2>like you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've had not just a silver spoon.</v>

2173
01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:39.710
<v Speaker 2>You've had the entire cutler early line</v>
<v Speaker 2>in your mouth since you were a baby.</v>

2174
01:45:39.711 --> 01:45:42.210
<v Speaker 2>You were born with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The whole thing is it's,</v>

2175
01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:45.080
<v Speaker 2>it's unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's unfair and uneven.</v>

2176
01:45:45.081 --> 01:45:49.280
<v Speaker 2>It's bizarre to me that some folks don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>recognize that,</v>

2177
01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:50.960
<v Speaker 2>that they don't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't.</v>

2178
01:45:51.010 --> 01:45:53.270
<v Speaker 2>They don't look at it like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2179
01:45:53.271 --> 01:45:55.070
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of conflict out there.</v>

2180
01:45:55.071 --> 01:45:57.140
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of different conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They vary.</v>

2181
01:45:57.830 --> 01:45:59.690
<v Speaker 2>It vary so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

2182
01:46:00.020 --> 01:46:02.870
<v Speaker 2>I think there's also a tendency to say</v>
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

2183
01:46:03.410 --> 01:46:05.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to expect people who do,</v>

2184
01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:10.010
<v Speaker 2>who are wealthy to just be totally happy</v>
<v Speaker 2>and totally like avid together.</v>

2185
01:46:10.011 --> 01:46:13.040
<v Speaker 2>Look at all the advantage you have when</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times you see these people,</v>

2186
01:46:13.041 --> 01:46:14.840
<v Speaker 2>they're pretty fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2187
01:46:15.170 --> 01:46:16.460
<v Speaker 2>but society says,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2188
01:46:16.461 --> 01:46:17.900
<v Speaker 2>you've had every opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2189
01:46:17.901 --> 01:46:19.700
<v Speaker 2>you didn't have to struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should be fine.</v>

2190
01:46:20.060 --> 01:46:20.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>

2191
01:46:20.961 --> 01:46:23.780
<v Speaker 2>those internal forces or a motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2192
01:46:23.781 --> 01:46:25.330
<v Speaker 2>and if you're not dealing with those</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2193
01:46:25.340 --> 01:46:26.900
<v Speaker 2>doesn't matter how much money you start</v>
<v Speaker 2>with,</v>

2194
01:46:27.260 --> 01:46:30.020
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have all the money to access all the</v>

2195
01:46:30.021 --> 01:46:33.110
<v Speaker 2>drugs in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have all of the ways to escape and</v>

2196
01:46:33.111 --> 01:46:35.270
<v Speaker 2>not any of the tools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2197
01:46:35.271 --> 01:46:39.890
<v Speaker 2>to actually help you overcome those.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in a lot of cases you see the</v>

2198
01:46:39.891 --> 01:46:43.790
<v Speaker 2>children of these really wealthy people</v>
<v Speaker 2>are some of the most fucked up people</v>

2199
01:46:44.010 --> 01:46:45.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>around there.</v>

2200
01:46:45.180 --> 01:46:45.860
<v Speaker 2>Just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2201
01:46:45.860 --> 01:46:49.140
<v Speaker 2>It's just a really interesting thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you'd rather hang with somebody in</v>

2202
01:46:49.141 --> 01:46:50.340
<v Speaker 2>a super poor neighborhood</v>

2203
01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:54.240
<v Speaker 3>who's just real and down to earth and</v>
<v Speaker 3>mostly they have their shit together way</v>

2204
01:46:54.241 --> 01:46:57.420
<v Speaker 3>more than someone living in one of these</v>
<v Speaker 3>mcmansions somewhere.</v>

2205
01:46:57.450 --> 01:46:58.950
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've been forced to deal with</v>

2206
01:46:58.951 --> 01:47:01.110
<v Speaker 3>conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd be forced to find solutions.</v>

2207
01:47:01.250 --> 01:47:02.970
<v Speaker 3>They've had been forced to develop</v>
<v Speaker 3>character.</v>

2208
01:47:03.510 --> 01:47:07.140
<v Speaker 3>We define success too much by Zeros,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by numbers,</v>

2209
01:47:07.141 --> 01:47:09.360
<v Speaker 3>by yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much do you have?</v>

2210
01:47:09.510 --> 01:47:12.690
<v Speaker 3>How much money do you have?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the ultimate goal of success</v>

2211
01:47:12.990 --> 01:47:17.990
<v Speaker 3>instead of are you a happy person?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was listening to this Ted talk and it</v>

2212
01:47:18.211 --> 01:47:23.211
<v Speaker 3>was a woman who was a model and she was</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about how she hit the genetic</v>

2213
01:47:23.701 --> 01:47:25.350
<v Speaker 3>lottery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She was really honest about it.</v>

2214
01:47:25.351 --> 01:47:26.640
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for better or for worse,</v>

2215
01:47:26.730 --> 01:47:29.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what has been my life.</v>

2216
01:47:29.870 --> 01:47:31.350
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is my existence.</v>

2217
01:47:32.010 --> 01:47:36.690
<v Speaker 3>And she said that a lot of people have</v>
<v Speaker 3>this idea about what makes you happy.</v>

2218
01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:39.270
<v Speaker 3>If my legs were thinner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be happy.</v>

2219
01:47:39.420 --> 01:47:41.430
<v Speaker 3>If my hair was Shinier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd be happy.</v>

2220
01:47:41.460 --> 01:47:44.400
<v Speaker 3>If my face was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my bone structure was better,</v>

2221
01:47:44.401 --> 01:47:45.750
<v Speaker 3>I'd be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She said,</v>

2222
01:47:45.751 --> 01:47:50.751
<v Speaker 3>but models in general are some of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>most unhappy,</v>

2223
01:47:51.060 --> 01:47:53.880
<v Speaker 3>insecure people on the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and she's like,</v>

2224
01:47:53.881 --> 01:47:55.650
<v Speaker 3>I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am insecure.</v>

2225
01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:58.740
<v Speaker 3>Like all my friends are insecure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are crazy.</v>

2226
01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:03.120
<v Speaker 3>There are all these nutty fucking models</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are dealing with bulemia and</v>

2227
01:48:03.121 --> 01:48:08.070
<v Speaker 3>Anorexia and speed and all these</v>
<v Speaker 3>different methods that they use to keep</v>

2228
01:48:08.071 --> 01:48:12.540
<v Speaker 3>their body weight down and all the fear</v>
<v Speaker 3>they have of aging and you know,</v>

2229
01:48:12.541 --> 01:48:16.140
<v Speaker 3>should I get botox and what treatments</v>
<v Speaker 3>should I be doing?</v>

2230
01:48:16.141 --> 01:48:21.141
<v Speaker 3>And they're constantly in this state of</v>
<v Speaker 3>chaos and fear and a lot of it is over</v>

2231
01:48:23.341 --> 01:48:28.260
<v Speaker 3>this weird gift that they have that</v>
<v Speaker 3>becomes almost a prison,</v>

2232
01:48:28.590 --> 01:48:33.450
<v Speaker 3>a prison to maintain this garden of</v>
<v Speaker 3>beauty that you've been bestowed with</v>

2233
01:48:33.570 --> 01:48:36.150
<v Speaker 3>from birth without any work at all.</v>

2234
01:48:36.390 --> 01:48:38.250
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've all seen people that are just</v>

2235
01:48:38.550 --> 01:48:41.250
<v Speaker 3>fucking beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just have a written and everyone's</v>

2236
01:48:41.251 --> 01:48:43.150
<v Speaker 3>drawn to them genetically.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And why?</v>

2237
01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:43.861
<v Speaker 3>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2238
01:48:43.861 --> 01:48:47.700
<v Speaker 3>because nature wants you to come in that</v>
<v Speaker 3>person to make people like them because</v>

2239
01:48:47.701 --> 01:48:49.860
<v Speaker 3>they have good symmetry and it's really</v>
<v Speaker 3>that simple.</v>

2240
01:48:49.861 --> 01:48:53.490
<v Speaker 3>But that poll,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that genetic poll is so overwhelming</v>

2241
01:48:53.491 --> 01:48:58.491
<v Speaker 3>that we use it to sell cars and we use</v>
<v Speaker 3>it to sell fucking condos and you know,</v>

2242
01:48:59.101 --> 01:49:01.080
<v Speaker 3>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a woman with long legs,</v>

2243
01:49:01.350 --> 01:49:02.750
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stepping into a car,</v>

2244
01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:03.720
<v Speaker 3>looking at you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're here,</v>

2245
01:49:03.870 --> 01:49:06.630
<v Speaker 3>makes you want to buy that car for</v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever fucking stupid reason.</v>

2246
01:49:07.140 --> 01:49:11.820
<v Speaker 3>And this idea that we have that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I have that,</v>

2247
01:49:11.821 --> 01:49:13.890
<v Speaker 3>I would be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2248
01:49:14.070 --> 01:49:17.790
<v Speaker 3>because look at the people who have it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many people who are super wealthy,</v>

2249
01:49:17.791 --> 01:49:22.230
<v Speaker 3>how many Wall Street people in Manhattan</v>
<v Speaker 3>right now are ready to jump off a</v>

2250
01:49:22.231 --> 01:49:24.000
<v Speaker 3>fucking building?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Their freaking.</v>

2251
01:49:24.001 --> 01:49:26.220
<v Speaker 3>They might have 100 million dollars in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bank.</v>

2252
01:49:26.460 --> 01:49:28.680
<v Speaker 3>They might be rich as fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're miserable.</v>

2253
01:49:28.830 --> 01:49:30.630
<v Speaker 3>They hate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're just want to do coke.</v>

2254
01:49:30.870 --> 01:49:35.760
<v Speaker 3>And the other thing about people that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are successful is oftentimes what</v>

2255
01:49:35.761 --> 01:49:38.490
<v Speaker 3>they're doing is not pleasurable but</v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

2256
01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:43.760
<v Speaker 3>But the reward is the numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reward is having numbers so they</v>

2257
01:49:44.221 --> 01:49:48.340
<v Speaker 3>indulge in that reward where they want</v>
<v Speaker 3>to buy versace</v>

2258
01:49:48.340 --> 01:49:53.340
<v Speaker 2>and wear a rolex and have a this and a</v>
<v Speaker 2>that and live in that or this and always</v>

2259
01:49:53.771 --> 01:49:57.340
<v Speaker 2>keep up with the Jones'.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And always have this quantified results</v>

2260
01:49:57.580 --> 01:49:59.320
<v Speaker 2>that they can show success.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2261
01:49:59.321 --> 01:50:00.160
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got,</v>

2262
01:50:00.420 --> 01:50:03.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in my day I've achieved blah blah,</v>

2263
01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:04.910
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I've got a all of them,</v>

2264
01:50:04.930 --> 01:50:09.100
<v Speaker 2>but who are you and are you happy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's not something that you can</v>

2265
01:50:09.101 --> 01:50:12.040
<v Speaker 2>put down on a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on a ledger,</v>

2266
01:50:12.041 --> 01:50:15.760
<v Speaker 2>you can't show that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't have a spreadsheet that shows</v>

2267
01:50:15.761 --> 01:50:17.260
<v Speaker 2>your happiness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2268
01:50:17.261 --> 01:50:19.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean I've,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've been in all different types of</v>

2269
01:50:19.481 --> 01:50:24.400
<v Speaker 2>circles from being indigenous places</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they have virtually nothing in</v>

2270
01:50:24.401 --> 01:50:28.660
<v Speaker 2>hanging out with local tribes in Africa</v>
<v Speaker 2>and South America and different places</v>

2271
01:50:28.661 --> 01:50:31.540
<v Speaker 2>than I've been at.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was at a birthday party where the</v>

2272
01:50:31.541 --> 01:50:36.541
<v Speaker 2>musical lineup was John foggerty</v>
<v Speaker 2>stinging and like some other crazy pan</v>

2273
01:50:37.481 --> 01:50:38.470
<v Speaker 2>at a birthday party.</v>

2274
01:50:38.470 --> 01:50:40.790
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's fucking birthday party present.</v>

2275
01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:42.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I should mention her</v>

2276
01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:43.390
<v Speaker 2>name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>

2277
01:50:43.391 --> 01:50:46.630
<v Speaker 2>it was a big hedge fund trader that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>an old family friend.</v>

2278
01:50:46.900 --> 01:50:48.590
<v Speaker 2>How much they spend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who knows?</v>

2279
01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:50.560
<v Speaker 2>Countless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>countless millions,</v>

2280
01:50:50.561 --> 01:50:52.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not a party on a party for his</v>

2281
01:50:52.991 --> 01:50:57.780
<v Speaker 2>birthday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was there and color for sure on the</v>

2282
01:50:57.790 --> 01:50:59.080
<v Speaker 2>other way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're happier.</v>

2283
01:50:59.110 --> 01:51:01.900
<v Speaker 2>That guy's out there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it was a weird thing though,</v>

2284
01:51:01.901 --> 01:51:04.390
<v Speaker 2>because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was actually pretty happy.</v>

2285
01:51:04.391 --> 01:51:05.080
<v Speaker 2>He's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a,</v>

2286
01:51:05.080 --> 01:51:08.560
<v Speaker 2>he's a hunter and he's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a cool dude and he was throwing the</v>

2287
01:51:08.561 --> 01:51:13.561
<v Speaker 2>party more for his guests than himself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which made him actually happier.</v>

2288
01:51:13.871 --> 01:51:16.000
<v Speaker 2>He was like the happiest person there</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he was like,</v>

2289
01:51:16.360 --> 01:51:18.940
<v Speaker 2>let me give you guys this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this awesome thing,</v>

2290
01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:23.320
<v Speaker 2>but the majority of the people there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could just feel I got pretty high</v>

2291
01:51:23.321 --> 01:51:26.590
<v Speaker 2>before I went because I was by myself</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I could just feel the sadness.</v>

2292
01:51:26.590 --> 01:51:29.510
<v Speaker 2>It reminded me of when I walked through</v>
<v Speaker 2>the red light district in Amsterdam or</v>

2293
01:51:29.511 --> 01:51:34.030
<v Speaker 2>it was just like the sadness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like nobody was giving these people like</v>

2294
01:51:34.031 --> 01:51:35.690
<v Speaker 2>a real hug.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was always a,</v>

2295
01:51:36.040 --> 01:51:39.550
<v Speaker 2>let me give you a hug and try and take</v>
<v Speaker 2>your money and give you a hug.</v>

2296
01:51:39.551 --> 01:51:42.970
<v Speaker 2>Try and take your money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they were just so guarded by that</v>

2297
01:51:42.971 --> 01:51:45.670
<v Speaker 2>whole paradigm that they've been in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2298
01:51:45.671 --> 01:51:49.810
<v Speaker 2>there's just these challenges that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>across the board that we have to</v>

2299
01:51:49.811 --> 01:51:53.140
<v Speaker 2>recognize in these traps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the trap of more money.</v>

2300
01:51:53.141 --> 01:51:57.040
<v Speaker 2>The trap of social media,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you know a girl posts something in</v>

2301
01:51:57.041 --> 01:51:59.710
<v Speaker 2>a sexy photos and then looks immediately</v>
<v Speaker 2>refresh,</v>

2302
01:51:59.711 --> 01:52:00.550
<v Speaker 2>refresh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>refresh,</v>

2303
01:52:00.551 --> 01:52:02.440
<v Speaker 2>how many likes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many likes,</v>

2304
01:52:02.441 --> 01:52:05.800
<v Speaker 2>how many likes this quantification of</v>
<v Speaker 2>how pretty you are,</v>

2305
01:52:05.980 --> 01:52:09.430
<v Speaker 2>and then you start to live by that and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then if you get less than that all,</v>

2306
01:52:09.431 --> 01:52:11.200
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I only got 60 likes on that.</v>

2307
01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:13.210
<v Speaker 2>Better slot it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I'm getting too old.</v>

2308
01:52:13.211 --> 01:52:17.470
<v Speaker 2>Maybe any more botox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll do it as a new treatment of vampire</v>

2309
01:52:17.471 --> 01:52:19.460
<v Speaker 2>treatments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stab your fucking skin.</v>

2310
01:52:19.500 --> 01:52:21.900
<v Speaker 2>Put baby blood in there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2311
01:52:22.060 --> 01:52:25.420
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's just traps and this were things</v>

2312
01:52:25.421 --> 01:52:27.670
<v Speaker 2>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have a few girls that are follow on</v>

<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2324
01:53:02.760 --> 01:53:05.210

<v Speaker 1>It looks real when they don't have the</v>

2325
01:53:05.211 --> 01:53:05.931
<v Speaker 1>legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2326
01:53:05.931 --> 01:53:08.180
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is all that weight in your ass?</v>

2327
01:53:09.230 --> 01:53:12.050
<v Speaker 1>Anatomically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like having boulder shoulders but</v>

2328
01:53:12.051 --> 01:53:15.380
<v Speaker 1>having like little skinny arms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are your shoulder so big?</v>

2329
01:53:15.650 --> 01:53:17.480
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that her?</v>

2330
01:53:17.900 --> 01:53:20.980
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

01:53:22.030 --> 01:53:24.320
<v Speaker 1>Look at that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's go to go to some better ones</v>

2332
01:53:24.321 --> 01:53:26.540
<v Speaker 1>were the ones right next to it in our</v>
<v Speaker 1>dress.</v>

2333
01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:29.120
<v Speaker 1>See down below,</v>
<v Speaker 1>down below,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Go to the right there.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You all pay up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh good Lord.</v>

2336
01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:39.440
<v Speaker 1>She just sticking her ass out and every</v>
<v Speaker 1>photo,</v>

2337
01:53:39.500 --> 01:53:41.780
<v Speaker 1>she's got that right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of little sway back thing,</v>

2338
01:53:42.020 --> 01:53:43.490
<v Speaker 1>but girls were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at her face.</v>

2339
01:53:43.520 --> 01:53:46.490
<v Speaker 1>Now she's not even that [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guess what girls?</v>

2340
01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:51.880
<v Speaker 1>Good enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>here to let you know the ass.</v>

2341
01:53:52.460 --> 01:53:56.480
<v Speaker 1>It trumps all those cheek bones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the,</v>

2342
01:53:56.510 --> 01:53:58.160
<v Speaker 1>all the other stuff that you're worried</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

2343
01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:00.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a tricky.</v>

2344
01:54:00.740 --> 01:54:03.560
<v Speaker 1>That's a tricky trap for her because</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's just obviously,</v>

2345
01:54:03.620 --> 01:54:06.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't know obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's going to be a seduction is</v>

2346
01:54:06.291 --> 01:54:07.690
<v Speaker 1>going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2347
01:54:07.790 --> 01:54:11.070
<v Speaker 1>I define myself by how attractive my ass</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

2348
01:54:11.300 --> 01:54:15.860
<v Speaker 1>Like that's where a lot of she's going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's scoring winds and her book based</v>

2349
01:54:15.861 --> 01:54:17.660
<v Speaker 1>upon those instagram followers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>likes.</v>

2350
01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:20.570
<v Speaker 1>At a certain point she's going to be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>40,</v>

2351
01:54:20.571 --> 01:54:25.571
<v Speaker 1>50 year old woman in the ass is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sag and it's gone or Kurzwell with</v>

2352
01:54:25.870 --> 01:54:26.810
<v Speaker 1>fucking science.</v>

2353
01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:30.300
<v Speaker 1>Kurzweil figures it all it permanent</v>
<v Speaker 1>giant ass,</v>

2354
01:54:30.860 --> 01:54:33.010
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that that's an issue that</v>

2355
01:54:33.050 --> 01:54:37.130
<v Speaker 1>particularly for females is something</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem when you put that much</v>

2356
01:54:37.131 --> 01:54:40.550
<v Speaker 1>emphasis on beauty being and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>female's fault,</v>

2357
01:54:40.551 --> 01:54:43.790
<v Speaker 1>it's society and everybody's fault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You put that much emphasis on beauty</v>

2358
01:54:43.791 --> 01:54:47.030
<v Speaker 1>being one of the defining self worth</v>
<v Speaker 1>characteristics.</v>

2359
01:54:47.330 --> 01:54:51.110
<v Speaker 1>Then when that starts to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in this mad fucking scramble for</v>

2360
01:54:51.111 --> 01:54:55.010
<v Speaker 1>as much surgery as possible to restore</v>
<v Speaker 1>this youth rather than appreciating the</v>

2361
01:54:55.011 --> 01:54:59.060
<v Speaker 1>gifts that each age bring.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like each aid should bring more wisdom</v>

2362
01:54:59.061 --> 01:55:01.990
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the older obsolete as like that</v>

2363
01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:05.750
<v Speaker 1>that you see down in the jungle that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have fucking magic that they're able to</v>

2364
01:55:05.751 --> 01:55:06.351
<v Speaker 1>bring like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>but I've lived 65 years.</v>

2366
01:55:09.201 --> 01:55:12.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm tuned into my instincts and I can</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking bring magic.</v>

2367

<v Speaker 1>I can do these different things.</v>

2368

<v Speaker 1>That's all well and good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but their instagram pictures of shit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

2372
01:55:30.710 --> 01:55:33.800

<v Speaker 1>you could look at a girl naked without</v>

2373
01:55:33.801 --> 01:55:35.900
<v Speaker 1>her being naked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but better than naked because it's all</v>

2374
01:55:35.901 --> 01:55:39.230
<v Speaker 1>compressed like it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you don't see the sloppy</v>

2375
01:55:39.231 --> 01:55:43.070
<v Speaker 1>aspects of skin and flesh and tissue and</v>

<v Speaker 7>Like the monkeys that have those colored</v>

2384
01:56:07.011 --> 01:56:09.800
<v Speaker 7>butts.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Totally freak out the monkeys out.</v>

2385
01:56:10.820 --> 01:56:15.820
<v Speaker 7>What the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 7>That boone ass fucking goddamn explosion</v>

2386
01:56:17.931 --> 01:56:19.760
<v Speaker 7>of fireworks coming out of their</v>
<v Speaker 7>asshole.</v>

2387
01:56:20.350 --> 01:56:22.400
<v Speaker 7>They should be baboons,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yoga pants.</v>

2388
01:56:23.080 --> 01:56:27.890
<v Speaker 7>The most popular yoga pants would maybe</v>
<v Speaker 7>be too much.</v>

2389
01:56:28.070 --> 01:56:31.690
<v Speaker 7>It was just all flesh color,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just all normal and then just fold</v>

2390
01:56:31.691 --> 01:56:36.691
<v Speaker 7>baboons.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It would be too much asking too much.</v>

2391
01:56:38.660 --> 01:56:39.300
<v Speaker 7>It's weird.</v>

2392
01:56:39.300 --> 01:56:41.400
<v Speaker 3>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shapes,</v>

2393
01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:46.760
<v Speaker 3>shapes become insanely attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I was looking at pornography the</v>

2394
01:56:47.011 --> 01:56:51.840
<v Speaker 3>other day and the girl had a natural</v>
<v Speaker 3>body and it's so weird when you see</v>

2395
01:56:51.841 --> 01:56:55.530
<v Speaker 3>natural tits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>big natural tits juggling around.</v>

2396
01:56:55.531 --> 01:56:57.330
<v Speaker 3>She had a natural ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

2397
01:56:57.331 --> 01:56:58.200
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is fascinating.</v>

2398
01:56:58.201 --> 01:57:00.870
<v Speaker 3>Like these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these are fat deposits that are very</v>

2399
01:57:00.871 --> 01:57:04.350
<v Speaker 3>attractive because they're.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're really good when you get</v>

2400
01:57:04.351 --> 01:57:05.940
<v Speaker 3>pregnant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're pregnant,</v>

2401
01:57:05.941 --> 01:57:08.130
<v Speaker 3>you should have wide hips.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The baby comes out easier.</v>

2402
01:57:08.310 --> 01:57:12.210
<v Speaker 3>Hip to waist ratio,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hip to waist ratio has been shown by</v>

2403
01:57:12.211 --> 01:57:16.170
<v Speaker 3>scientists to have a drug like effect on</v>
<v Speaker 3>heterosexual males.</v>

2404
01:57:16.620 --> 01:57:19.890
<v Speaker 3>Like it literally is a drug.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a hip to waist ratio.</v>

2405
01:57:19.891 --> 01:57:24.270
<v Speaker 3>That's almost like when a man sees a</v>
<v Speaker 3>girl with small ways in a big ass</v>

2406
01:57:25.860 --> 01:57:27.800
<v Speaker 3>your your body,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body just goes,</v>

2407
01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:29.240
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>

2408
01:57:29.570 --> 01:57:31.520
<v Speaker 3>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man on deck man on deck.</v>

2409
01:57:31.760 --> 01:57:33.230
<v Speaker 3>Like you're going,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're about to go to war.</v>

2410
01:57:33.290 --> 01:57:37.760
<v Speaker 3>Like it's time to be on your toes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like there's a drug and that drug is</v>

2411
01:57:37.761 --> 01:57:39.050
<v Speaker 3>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's an ass.</v>

2412
01:57:39.180 --> 01:57:41.690
<v Speaker 3>It's an ass and it's a form.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a shape.</v>

2413
01:57:42.080 --> 01:57:47.080
<v Speaker 3>But if you see someone and she's got the</v>
<v Speaker 3>the back and ass of a Guatemalan</v>

2414
01:57:47.781 --> 01:57:50.420
<v Speaker 3>housekeeper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know where they have like that</v>

2415
01:57:50.421 --> 01:57:55.220
<v Speaker 3>really the like the hat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ass to weight ratio is nonexistent,</v>

2416
01:57:55.430 --> 01:57:58.520
<v Speaker 3>is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a parallel line like the twin towers</v>

2417
01:57:58.521 --> 01:58:01.930
<v Speaker 3>from her shoulders down to her hips and</v>
<v Speaker 3>was with,</v>

2418
01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:04.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's just a weird sort of body and a</v>

2419
01:58:04.671 --> 01:58:08.210
<v Speaker 3>flat ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And like for whatever reason that is</v>

2420
01:58:08.211 --> 01:58:11.300
<v Speaker 3>completely unattractive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she sidestep to a wall.</v>

2421
01:58:11.301 --> 01:58:14.740
<v Speaker 3>All parts would touch at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want that.</v>

2422
01:58:14.950 --> 01:58:16.820
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's weird like that.</v>

2423
01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:21.880
<v Speaker 3>These shapes have these ingrained the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're quantified in our brain,</v>

2424
01:58:23.100 --> 01:58:24.770
<v Speaker 3>like you see these girls in their yoga</v>
<v Speaker 3>pants,</v>

2425
01:58:24.771 --> 01:58:26.840
<v Speaker 3>like that girl that has the millions of</v>
<v Speaker 3>instagram pages.</v>

2426
01:58:27.170 --> 01:58:32.170
<v Speaker 3>If the Guatemalan housekeeper with her</v>
<v Speaker 3>big wide back in her flat ass had the</v>

2427
01:58:32.541 --> 01:58:34.790
<v Speaker 3>same poses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like nobody would care.</v>

2428
01:58:35.650 --> 01:58:38.840
<v Speaker 3>We need what we're looking for certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>shapes.</v>

2429
01:58:39.110 --> 01:58:40.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There was even a theory that,</v>

2430
01:58:41.170 --> 01:58:42.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason</v>

2431
01:58:42.130 --> 01:58:44.950
<v Speaker 2>why people like cleavage and I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know if this theory is accurate,</v>

2432
01:58:44.951 --> 01:58:49.951
<v Speaker 2>but that cleavage actually reminds our</v>
<v Speaker 2>brain of what a butt crack looks like.</v>

2433
01:58:51.790 --> 01:58:55.120
<v Speaker 2>And so that's one of the reasons why</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's sexually attractive to males.</v>

2434
01:58:55.510 --> 01:59:00.510
<v Speaker 2>That shape of those lumps of fat pushed</v>
<v Speaker 2>together in that kind of format is like</v>

2435
01:59:01.600 --> 01:59:03.760
<v Speaker 2>a trick into our brain where it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

2436
01:59:03.761 --> 01:59:06.250
<v Speaker 2>an ass on the chest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense.</v>

2437
01:59:06.310 --> 01:59:08.230
<v Speaker 2>Kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it also makes sense that,</v>

2438
01:59:08.231 --> 01:59:09.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the tits are that big,</v>

2439
01:59:09.551 --> 01:59:10.930
<v Speaker 2>they're touching together and once you</v>
<v Speaker 2>were released,</v>

2440
01:59:10.931 --> 01:59:15.820
<v Speaker 2>those mamas pop that snap on the Bra and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they come out to play.</v>

2441
01:59:15.821 --> 01:59:18.370
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's another bizarre one.</v>

2442
01:59:18.371 --> 01:59:21.340
<v Speaker 2>Like tits or magic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are fucking magical.</v>

2443
01:59:21.341 --> 01:59:25.270
<v Speaker 2>Nipples are magic when they get hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're sucking on a nipple and it</v>

2444
01:59:25.271 --> 01:59:29.260
<v Speaker 2>gets erect like that is a magic moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's something exciting about that.</v>

2445
01:59:29.980 --> 01:59:32.950
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a fucking cool world we live in.</v>

2446
01:59:32.951 --> 01:59:35.500
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sometimes think like if we were all</v>

2447
01:59:35.501 --> 01:59:39.370
<v Speaker 2>just consciousness and more in reality</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't exist in this world,</v>

2448
01:59:39.371 --> 01:59:40.990
<v Speaker 2>didn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we were like,</v>

2449
01:59:40.991 --> 01:59:41.830
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what should we do?</v>

2450
01:59:41.831 --> 01:59:43.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's create the fucking coolest video</v>

2451
01:59:43.871 --> 01:59:45.250
<v Speaker 2>game ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2452
01:59:45.251 --> 01:59:49.420
<v Speaker 2>something that has lots of boss battles</v>
<v Speaker 2>and challenges and different things you</v>

2453
01:59:49.421 --> 01:59:52.660
<v Speaker 2>can do and you can have sex and it feels</v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing and you can accumulate things</v>

2454
01:59:52.661 --> 01:59:56.140
<v Speaker 2>and you interact with other players.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the most massive multiplayer</v>

2455
01:59:56.141 --> 01:59:59.320
<v Speaker 2>online experience possible and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2456
01:59:59.321 --> 02:00:00.310
<v Speaker 2>let's do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2457
02:00:00.311 --> 02:00:03.310
<v Speaker 2>I got an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's make it so that you think it's</v>

2458
02:00:03.311 --> 02:00:05.770
<v Speaker 2>totally real when you're playing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>game,</v>

2459
02:00:05.980 --> 02:00:07.990
<v Speaker 2>you don't know it's a game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then it was like,</v>

2460
02:00:08.020 --> 02:00:10.240
<v Speaker 2>fuck yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that game is even better.</v>

2461
02:00:10.550 --> 02:00:13.180
<v Speaker 2>And I kind of feel like that's really</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we're doing here.</v>

2462
02:00:13.180 --> 02:00:18.180
<v Speaker 2>We're in this like the best possible</v>
<v Speaker 2>video game that we could create and it's</v>

2463
02:00:18.371 --> 02:00:22.210
<v Speaker 2>so good because we think it's fully real</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's such a good game that we can</v>

2464
02:00:22.211 --> 02:00:26.410
<v Speaker 2>create mini games within the game and</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually play video games in our video</v>

2465
02:00:26.411 --> 02:00:31.411
<v Speaker 2>game and those are awesome too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Know it's like the most crazy thing that</v>

2466
02:00:31.841 --> 02:00:33.750
<v Speaker 2>we've done and then we get back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2467
02:00:33.810 --> 02:00:35.860
<v Speaker 2>and in my believe that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2468
02:00:35.980 --> 02:00:39.280
<v Speaker 2>when we're done with this experience,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we get back and we get to look and go,</v>

2469
02:00:39.580 --> 02:00:41.410
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a crazy fucking turn.</v>

2470
02:00:41.650 --> 02:00:43.630
<v Speaker 2>And then get to decide like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2471
02:00:43.631 --> 02:00:44.740
<v Speaker 2>let's go again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's do it.</v>

2472
02:00:44.741 --> 02:00:46.210
<v Speaker 2>Let's play in this world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2473
02:00:46.240 --> 02:00:47.730
<v Speaker 2>earth world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And maybe there's another world.</v>

2474
02:00:47.731 --> 02:00:49.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if there is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but maybe there's another world and you</v>

2475
02:00:49.841 --> 02:00:51.100
<v Speaker 2>can say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

2476
02:00:51.101 --> 02:00:53.530
<v Speaker 2>that's playing that fucking world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That world looks fun.</v>

2477
02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:55.600
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's just this opportunity.</v>

2478
02:00:55.601 --> 02:01:00.601
<v Speaker 2>And I think at least even having that</v>
<v Speaker 2>perspective really gets me to appreciate</v>

2479
02:01:00.641 --> 02:01:01.870
<v Speaker 2>this even more like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2480
02:01:01.871 --> 02:01:04.630
<v Speaker 2>there's struggles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but every video game is going to have</v>

2481
02:01:04.631 --> 02:01:06.970
<v Speaker 2>those struggles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna have that thing where you can</v>

2482
02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:09.370
<v Speaker 2>barely beat it and it takes you a long</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2483
02:01:09.371 --> 02:01:12.490
<v Speaker 2>That's like a good game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like it's just challenging enough</v>

2484
02:01:12.491 --> 02:01:15.880
<v Speaker 2>where if you apply yourself completely</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're at the edge of your skill,</v>

2485
02:01:16.120 --> 02:01:17.120
<v Speaker 2>you can win.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise,</v>

2486
02:01:17.121 --> 02:01:18.340
<v Speaker 2>if it's too easy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not fun.</v>

2487
02:01:18.341 --> 02:01:20.050
<v Speaker 2>You throw that fucking game away real</v>
<v Speaker 2>quick.</v>

2488
02:01:20.750 --> 02:01:22.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2489
02:01:22.040 --> 02:01:24.910
<v Speaker 2>Unless you live in the Congo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you game sucks and your game,</v>

2490
02:01:25.240 --> 02:01:27.730
<v Speaker 2>you're in a level that's really too</v>
<v Speaker 2>hard.</v>

2491
02:01:28.210 --> 02:01:33.210
<v Speaker 2>Blows get parasites and malaria and</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking war lords.</v>

2492
02:01:33.551 --> 02:01:36.190
<v Speaker 2>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This game's dogs playing halo with a</v>

2493
02:01:36.191 --> 02:01:39.260
<v Speaker 2>bunch of professionals that just fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>headshot you all day like I</v>

2494
02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:41.830
<v Speaker 3>can't even play.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2495
02:01:42.590 --> 02:01:45.140
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fascinated by simulation theory.</v>

2496
02:01:45.340 --> 02:01:50.240
<v Speaker 3>I'm fascinated by the fact that there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>actual physicists that are bantering and</v>

2497
02:01:50.750 --> 02:01:55.750
<v Speaker 3>throwing around this idea that it is</v>
<v Speaker 3>possible that at one time in the future,</v>

2498
02:01:56.750 --> 02:01:59.150
<v Speaker 3>in the near future,</v>
<v Speaker 3>perhaps like within the next 20 or 30</v>

2499
02:01:59.151 --> 02:02:01.610
<v Speaker 3>years even,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they're going to be able to create</v>

2500
02:02:01.611 --> 02:02:04.730
<v Speaker 3>an artificial reality that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>indistinguishable from the reality we're</v>

2501
02:02:04.731 --> 02:02:08.150
<v Speaker 3>currently experiencing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You are going to be able to enter into a</v>

2502
02:02:08.151 --> 02:02:11.590
<v Speaker 3>fake world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's through some sort of a a</v>

2503
02:02:11.630 --> 02:02:16.160
<v Speaker 3>chip that they can put into your mind or</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's some sort of a virtual</v>

2504
02:02:16.161 --> 02:02:21.161
<v Speaker 3>reality headset that you put on that</v>
<v Speaker 3>allows you to interface with some sort</v>

2505
02:02:21.561 --> 02:02:25.010
<v Speaker 3>of computer stimulation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it makes it indistinguishable</v>

2506
02:02:25.011 --> 02:02:27.380
<v Speaker 3>from reality.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're currently experiencing that.</v>

2507
02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:32.000
<v Speaker 3>We're going to come to a point in time</v>
<v Speaker 3>where it gets so good you can't tell if</v>

2508
02:02:32.001 --> 02:02:35.240
<v Speaker 3>it's really not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so how do we know if we're not already</v>

2509
02:02:35.241 --> 02:02:36.050
<v Speaker 3>in it?</v>

2510
02:02:36.050 --> 02:02:40.610
<v Speaker 3>How do we know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How do we know if that isn't the entire</v>

2511
02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:44.330
<v Speaker 3>process?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Being some sort of bizarre fractal thing</v>

2512
02:02:44.720 --> 02:02:48.890
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>From the time a cell divides into two</v>

2513
02:02:48.891 --> 02:02:52.310
<v Speaker 3>cells,</v>
<v Speaker 3>becomes a multicellular organism,</v>

2514
02:02:52.520 --> 02:02:55.580
<v Speaker 3>becomes a more complex multicellular</v>
<v Speaker 3>organism,</v>

2515
02:02:55.880 --> 02:02:59.480
<v Speaker 3>become sentient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>becomes something that's creative,</v>

2516
02:02:59.510 --> 02:03:01.430
<v Speaker 3>become something that's not just</v>
<v Speaker 3>creative,</v>

2517
02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:05.930
<v Speaker 3>but can manipulate its environment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has articulating fingers that change the</v>

2518
02:03:05.931 --> 02:03:09.980
<v Speaker 3>atmosphere around it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>changed the physical world in which it</v>

2519
02:03:09.981 --> 02:03:11.960
<v Speaker 3>lives,</v>
<v Speaker 3>alter the weather,</v>

2520
02:03:12.170 --> 02:03:17.170
<v Speaker 3>alter the structure of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are around them and then gets to the</v>

2521
02:03:17.481 --> 02:03:22.481
<v Speaker 3>point where creates an artificial world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>creates a world that's so complex and so</v>

2522
02:03:24.021 --> 02:03:27.170
<v Speaker 3>bizarre that it only exists in ones and</v>
<v Speaker 3>zeroes,</v>

2523
02:03:27.500 --> 02:03:31.490
<v Speaker 3>but is indistinguishable when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>interface with it,</v>

2524
02:03:31.790 --> 02:03:33.440
<v Speaker 3>that when you interface with it there as</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2525
02:03:33.441 --> 02:03:35.810
<v Speaker 3>is that a real world?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's to say it's not?</v>

2526
02:03:35.930 --> 02:03:37.610
<v Speaker 3>Who's to say your worlds real?</v>

2527
02:03:37.790 --> 02:03:42.650
<v Speaker 3>If you get deep into your world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you go deep into the subatomic realm,</v>

2528
02:03:42.651 --> 02:03:46.700
<v Speaker 3>what is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's all fucking space and and magic.</v>

2529
02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:49.970
<v Speaker 3>When you get into the world of subatomic</v>
<v Speaker 3>particles.</v>

2530
02:03:49.971 --> 02:03:53.930
<v Speaker 3>I have tried so hard to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've watched lectures and listen to</v>

2531
02:03:53.931 --> 02:03:58.931
<v Speaker 3>people give speeches about quantum</v>
<v Speaker 3>theory and about the interaction of</v>

2532
02:03:59.781 --> 02:04:03.680
<v Speaker 3>subatomic particles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Particles that are in superposition,</v>

2533
02:04:03.950 --> 02:04:06.950
<v Speaker 3>which means they're still and moving at</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same time.</v>

2534
02:04:07.020 --> 02:04:10.730
<v Speaker 3>There was one of two possible outcomes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They blink in and out of existence.</v>

2535
02:04:10.731 --> 02:04:13.910
<v Speaker 3>Observance of them is what decides which</v>
<v Speaker 3>one they are.</v>

2536
02:04:13.940 --> 02:04:15.080
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2537
02:04:15.081 --> 02:04:19.280
<v Speaker 3>how about the fact that they go away and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we don't know where they go and then</v>

2538
02:04:19.281 --> 02:04:23.360
<v Speaker 3>they reemerge somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They blink in and out of existence so we</v>

2539
02:04:23.361 --> 02:04:27.020
<v Speaker 3>have no explanation for it based on our</v>
<v Speaker 3>current understanding or a current</v>

2540
02:04:27.021 --> 02:04:28.760
<v Speaker 3>ability to measure what's happening.</v>

2541
02:04:29.450 --> 02:04:33.530
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that'll get more complex and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 3>have some more answers in the future</v>

2542
02:04:33.531 --> 02:04:35.690
<v Speaker 3>when they get better at figuring this</v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff out,</v>

2543
02:04:35.930 --> 02:04:38.610
<v Speaker 3>but the current understanding of</v>
<v Speaker 3>subatomic particles when they get into</v>

2544
02:04:38.880 --> 02:04:42.120
<v Speaker 3>things like superposition is like you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>dealing with magic.</v>

2545
02:04:42.300 --> 02:04:45.510
<v Speaker 3>You're dealing with something that</v>
<v Speaker 3>literally if you.</v>

2546
02:04:45.511 --> 02:04:48.750
<v Speaker 3>If you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it didn't exist and you tried to say,</v>

2547
02:04:48.900 --> 02:04:50.760
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to create something that</v>

2548
02:04:50.761 --> 02:04:54.630
<v Speaker 3>exists and doesn't exist as something</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's moving and still I'm going to</v>

2549
02:04:54.631 --> 02:04:58.860
<v Speaker 3>create something that's here and then it</v>
<v Speaker 3>goes away and we don't know where it is</v>

2550
02:04:58.861 --> 02:05:01.260
<v Speaker 3>and it comes back in another place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People would go,</v>

2551
02:05:01.261 --> 02:05:02.970
<v Speaker 3>shut the fuck up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just shut up.</v>

2552
02:05:03.000 --> 02:05:05.910
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about nonsense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's not nonsense.</v>

2553
02:05:06.030 --> 02:05:08.040
<v Speaker 3>That's subatomic particles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These are.</v>

2554
02:05:08.041 --> 02:05:12.640
<v Speaker 3>This is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a real acceptable aspect of of</v>

2555
02:05:12.690 --> 02:05:15.330
<v Speaker 3>the scientific method.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've gotten down to this,</v>

2556
02:05:15.600 --> 02:05:18.630
<v Speaker 3>they've examined this and this is</v>
<v Speaker 3>accepted across the board,</v>

2557
02:05:18.780 --> 02:05:20.460
<v Speaker 3>but these people that study it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2558
02:05:20.461 --> 02:05:21.330
<v Speaker 3>what does that even.</v>

2559
02:05:21.750 --> 02:05:26.750
<v Speaker 3>How is that more real than this</v>
<v Speaker 3>simulation that someone's created with</v>

2560
02:05:27.031 --> 02:05:31.080
<v Speaker 3>the computer that makes you feel like</v>
<v Speaker 3>you really are running from dinosaurs in</v>

2561
02:05:31.081 --> 02:05:34.110
<v Speaker 3>Jurassic Park,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel the wet leaves under your bare</v>

2562
02:05:34.111 --> 02:05:37.110
<v Speaker 3>feet as you're sprinting away from a</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking raptor.</v>

2563
02:05:37.380 --> 02:05:39.360
<v Speaker 3>How did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How has that more real?</v>

2564
02:05:40.100 --> 02:05:43.950
<v Speaker 3>What is real and what is not real?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's going to get real fuzzy.</v>

2565
02:05:44.100 --> 02:05:47.580
<v Speaker 3>That's going to get real strange when</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to define reality.</v>

2566
02:05:47.820 --> 02:05:52.820
<v Speaker 3>When you know that this desk that I'm</v>
<v Speaker 3>hitting on is filled with Adams and</v>

2567
02:05:54.090 --> 02:05:57.420
<v Speaker 3>those inside those atoms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's mostly space.</v>

2568
02:05:57.990 --> 02:06:00.720
<v Speaker 3>We don't understand why there's so much</v>
<v Speaker 3>empty space,</v>

2569
02:06:00.721 --> 02:06:03.390
<v Speaker 3>but what is in there like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why is it hard?</v>

2570
02:06:03.630 --> 02:06:05.370
<v Speaker 3>Like why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>How come when I knock on this?</v>

2571
02:06:05.371 --> 02:06:08.040
<v Speaker 3>It's hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but when I put my hand through water,</v>

2572
02:06:08.150 --> 02:06:11.040
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't water of Adam's to like</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's going on here,</v>

2573
02:06:11.190 --> 02:06:13.830
<v Speaker 3>like what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is real and what's not real or are</v>

2574
02:06:13.860 --> 02:06:18.060
<v Speaker 3>definitions of what's real and what's</v>
<v Speaker 3>not real or what can I put on a scale?</v>

2575
02:06:18.180 --> 02:06:20.490
<v Speaker 3>What can I put a ruler across and</v>
<v Speaker 3>measure,</v>

2576
02:06:20.670 --> 02:06:21.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

2577
02:06:21.370 --> 02:06:23.040
<v Speaker 3>how am I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what can I sell you?</v>

2578
02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:27.420
<v Speaker 3>What can I put a barcode on and package</v>
<v Speaker 3>it and sell it at whole foods?</v>

2579
02:06:27.660 --> 02:06:29.610
<v Speaker 3>What is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is real and what's not real?</v>

2580
02:06:30.160 --> 02:06:35.160
<v Speaker 2>I think that the way that in my</v>
<v Speaker 2>explorations go in as deep as I possibly</v>

2581
02:06:35.411 --> 02:06:39.040
<v Speaker 2>can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is where I generally turn first,</v>

2582
02:06:39.041 --> 02:06:41.920
<v Speaker 2>is the way that I've understand that</v>
<v Speaker 2>understood it,</v>

2583
02:06:41.921 --> 02:06:46.921
<v Speaker 2>is that collectively we did create kind</v>
<v Speaker 2>of a simulation and at least in my own</v>

2584
02:06:47.150 --> 02:06:48.490
<v Speaker 2>experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2585
02:06:48.790 --> 02:06:50.890
<v Speaker 2>illuminated in my own imagination</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps,</v>

2586
02:06:51.220 --> 02:06:55.690
<v Speaker 2>but collectively we did create a</v>
<v Speaker 2>simulation and that simulation was led</v>

2587
02:06:55.691 --> 02:06:56.770
<v Speaker 2>by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2588
02:06:56.830 --> 02:06:58.630
<v Speaker 2>just intent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The desire to say,</v>

2589
02:06:58.660 --> 02:06:59.740
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's do this.</v>

2590
02:06:59.770 --> 02:07:02.080
<v Speaker 2>Let's have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's have a physical manifest.</v>

2591
02:07:02.081 --> 02:07:06.220
<v Speaker 2>Let's have things that we can knock our</v>
<v Speaker 2>knuckles on and have this opportunity to</v>

2592
02:07:06.221 --> 02:07:09.400
<v Speaker 2>do it collectively as that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as that unified force,</v>

2593
02:07:09.401 --> 02:07:13.690
<v Speaker 2>kind of like the one voice in our body</v>
<v Speaker 2>that collectively makes decisions even</v>

2594
02:07:13.691 --> 02:07:16.810
<v Speaker 2>though we have all of these other</v>
<v Speaker 2>organisms all vying for different</v>

2595
02:07:16.811 --> 02:07:17.650
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Collectively.</v>

2596
02:07:17.651 --> 02:07:22.570
<v Speaker 2>There was a yes and then there was like</v>
<v Speaker 2>an intelligence in place led by the</v>

2597
02:07:22.571 --> 02:07:23.440
<v Speaker 2>sacred geometry.</v>

2598
02:07:23.440 --> 02:07:26.410
<v Speaker 2>That very quantum stuff that makes</v>
<v Speaker 2>things stuff.</v>

2599
02:07:26.830 --> 02:07:31.830
<v Speaker 2>Then that artificial intelligence</v>
<v Speaker 2>created the perfect solution for that</v>

2600
02:07:32.050 --> 02:07:36.010
<v Speaker 2>initial intent which led and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultimately leading us and maybe other</v>

2601
02:07:36.011 --> 02:07:41.011
<v Speaker 2>sentient beings who could potentially</v>
<v Speaker 2>create other worlds downstream as well,</v>

2602
02:07:42.270 --> 02:07:44.410
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it could just continue with creating</v>

2603
02:07:44.440 --> 02:07:49.030
<v Speaker 2>other and then eventually those sentient</v>
<v Speaker 2>beings that have been created from the</v>

2604
02:07:49.031 --> 02:07:52.900
<v Speaker 2>intent and allowing rules like</v>
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligence or sacred</v>

2605
02:07:52.901 --> 02:07:54.940
<v Speaker 2>geometry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Allowing those rules to create the world</v>

2606
02:07:54.941 --> 02:07:56.470
<v Speaker 2>perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if you're actually trying to</v>

2607
02:07:56.471 --> 02:07:58.750
<v Speaker 2>program that Shit's too complex.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Possible.</v>

2608
02:07:58.960 --> 02:08:01.360
<v Speaker 2>But if you have rules in place like all</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

2609
02:08:01.361 --> 02:08:04.270
<v Speaker 2>this artificial intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll figure it out according to these</v>

2610
02:08:04.271 --> 02:08:07.120
<v Speaker 2>different laws of evolution and</v>
<v Speaker 2>reproduction will make these things</v>

2611
02:08:07.270 --> 02:08:09.160
<v Speaker 2>combined together in certain ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2612
02:08:09.430 --> 02:08:11.290
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the rules of the system and it</v>

2613
02:08:11.291 --> 02:08:14.860
<v Speaker 2>will flourish in a certain way that will</v>
<v Speaker 2>survive until eventually there'll be</v>

2614
02:08:14.920 --> 02:08:15.920
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2615
02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:17.380
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

2616
02:08:17.381 --> 02:08:21.490
<v Speaker 2>these other sentient beings that then</v>
<v Speaker 2>couldn't create eventually downstream</v>

2617
02:08:21.491 --> 02:08:25.870
<v Speaker 2>worlds when their ability to create</v>
<v Speaker 2>artificial intelligence in these other</v>

2618
02:08:25.871 --> 02:08:29.680
<v Speaker 2>rules will happen and that can go to</v>
<v Speaker 2>infinity,</v>

2619
02:08:30.100 --> 02:08:32.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we may be somewhere in that infinity</v>

2620
02:08:33.100 --> 02:08:34.690
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2621
02:08:34.820 --> 02:08:39.760
<v Speaker 2>and it just goes on forever and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>this mind blowing kind of thing where</v>

2622
02:08:39.761 --> 02:08:41.680
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit,</v>

2623
02:08:41.770 --> 02:08:44.110
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we could be in a simulation that's</v>

2624
02:08:44.111 --> 02:08:47.470
<v Speaker 2>part of a simulation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to create another simulation,</v>

2625
02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:48.810
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like we're,</v>

2626
02:08:48.850 --> 02:08:51.610
<v Speaker 2>we're our own universe in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>multiverse,</v>

2627
02:08:51.850 --> 02:08:56.110
<v Speaker 2>creating a micro verse which is a</v>
<v Speaker 2>universe and it's own multiverse and</v>

2628
02:08:56.111 --> 02:08:57.490
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just goes on forever.</v>

2629
02:08:57.790 --> 02:08:59.230
<v Speaker 3>Just like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not even high.</v>

2630
02:09:00.130 --> 02:09:02.770
<v Speaker 3>We're sober stone cold sober.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These full console owners.</v>

2631
02:09:02.800 --> 02:09:04.180
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>incorrect.</v>

2632
02:09:05.140 --> 02:09:07.510
<v Speaker 3>I have a theory about artificial</v>
<v Speaker 3>intelligence.</v>

2633
02:09:07.540 --> 02:09:10.510
<v Speaker 3>I think the idea is very flawed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The premise is flawed.</v>

2634
02:09:10.750 --> 02:09:12.880
<v Speaker 3>It is intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not artificial.</v>

2635
02:09:12.881 --> 02:09:16.540
<v Speaker 3>What's artificial?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's created on earth with materials.</v>

2636
02:09:16.720 --> 02:09:20.290
<v Speaker 3>Why is it natural?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's created with come and it's not</v>

2637
02:09:20.350 --> 02:09:24.490
<v Speaker 3>natural if it's created with silicon</v>
<v Speaker 3>chips and it doesn't make any sense like</v>

2638
02:09:24.650 --> 02:09:27.250
<v Speaker 3>it is intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's intelligence that's not</v>

2639
02:09:27.251 --> 02:09:32.251
<v Speaker 3>biological in origin in the sense of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not based on the cellular structure</v>

2640
02:09:32.951 --> 02:09:37.660
<v Speaker 3>that all biological entities on earth</v>
<v Speaker 3>possess.</v>

2641
02:09:37.750 --> 02:09:42.750
<v Speaker 3>Like it's something that's made with</v>
<v Speaker 3>human beings manipulating the raw</v>

2642
02:09:42.791 --> 02:09:46.600
<v Speaker 3>materials of the earth and creating</v>
<v Speaker 3>something through programming,</v>

2643
02:09:46.930 --> 02:09:47.860
<v Speaker 3>through,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2644
02:09:47.861 --> 02:09:50.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the fuck they make computers.</v>

2645
02:09:51.010 --> 02:09:54.940
<v Speaker 3>Whatever processes are involved that</v>
<v Speaker 3>creates this intelligence,</v>

2646
02:09:54.941 --> 02:09:57.850
<v Speaker 3>but it's not artificial at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's 100 percent real.</v>

2647
02:09:58.040 --> 02:09:58.873
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you eat,</v>

2648
02:09:59.020 --> 02:10:02.710
<v Speaker 3>like my kids have a kitchen set and eat</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of their fake tomatoes,</v>

2649
02:10:02.760 --> 02:10:05.500
<v Speaker 3>you're eating a fucking piece of plastic</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an artificial tomato.</v>

2650
02:10:06.430 --> 02:10:09.490
<v Speaker 3>That's hard official.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is not artificial intelligence.</v>

2651
02:10:09.491 --> 02:10:12.430
<v Speaker 3>It's actual intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's intelligence is created by</v>

2652
02:10:12.431 --> 02:10:17.290
<v Speaker 3>people that have manipulated the raw</v>
<v Speaker 3>materials of earth and then looked at</v>

2653
02:10:17.291 --> 02:10:21.760
<v Speaker 3>their own shortcomings and sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>modeled this idea of a future being</v>

2654
02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:26.530
<v Speaker 3>based on correcting what they see is</v>
<v Speaker 3>wrong with themselves.</v>

2655
02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:30.130
<v Speaker 3>But in doing so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what are we gonna?</v>

2656
02:10:30.280 --> 02:10:35.280
<v Speaker 3>What are we going to do to what we are?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's the big fear of artificial</v>

2657
02:10:35.301 --> 02:10:37.340
<v Speaker 3>intelligence is if we create something</v>
<v Speaker 3>better than us,</v>

2658
02:10:37.490 --> 02:10:39.900
<v Speaker 3>we have to come to the realization that</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are.</v>

2659
02:10:39.901 --> 02:10:44.060
<v Speaker 3>It's so flawed that we cannot be</v>
<v Speaker 3>repaired.</v>

2660
02:10:44.300 --> 02:10:48.200
<v Speaker 3>Like the idea of coming in people and</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting them pregnant and then a baby</v>

2661
02:10:48.201 --> 02:10:52.460
<v Speaker 3>comes out of their pussy and then</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone comes in that baby and you know</v>

2662
02:10:52.461 --> 02:10:55.850
<v Speaker 3>when they become an adult and that the</v>
<v Speaker 3>baby has a baby that comes out of their</v>

2663
02:10:55.851 --> 02:10:58.010
<v Speaker 3>pussy and then we see that's the only</v>
<v Speaker 3>way we do it.</v>

2664
02:10:58.340 --> 02:10:59.420
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the only way.</v>

2665
02:10:59.421 --> 02:11:02.600
<v Speaker 3>It's the way it's been because the</v>
<v Speaker 3>future is the past is no,</v>

2666
02:11:02.601 --> 02:11:03.950
<v Speaker 3>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

2667
02:11:03.980 --> 02:11:08.330
<v Speaker 3>It is a way to get to the point where we</v>
<v Speaker 3>create these beings that are far</v>

2668
02:11:08.331 --> 02:11:12.500
<v Speaker 3>superior than the what our biology is</v>
<v Speaker 3>capable of making.</v>

2669
02:11:12.920 --> 02:11:16.460
<v Speaker 3>I think you may be right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think we're in this hurry to do it</v>

2670
02:11:16.490 --> 02:11:18.200
<v Speaker 3>when I think we should just be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2671
02:11:18.201 --> 02:11:20.660
<v Speaker 3>this is the fucking golden age.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Genitals aren't going to be around</v>

2672
02:11:20.661 --> 02:11:21.930
<v Speaker 3>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2673
02:11:22.060 --> 02:11:24.320
<v Speaker 3>let's enjoy the shit out of this right</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

2674
02:11:24.321 --> 02:11:28.070
<v Speaker 3>Like I really feel like we're in this</v>
<v Speaker 3>transition point where we still have</v>

2675
02:11:28.071 --> 02:11:31.400
<v Speaker 3>those base or animal instincts that no</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking good,</v>

2676
02:11:31.790 --> 02:11:35.300
<v Speaker 3>but eventually I think you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We will transition out with whatever</v>

2677
02:11:35.301 --> 02:11:40.180
<v Speaker 3>Kinda Kurzweilian ways that we can</v>
<v Speaker 3>transcend death and you know,</v>

2678
02:11:41.000 --> 02:11:43.190
<v Speaker 3>have different reproduction done in</v>
<v Speaker 3>different way.</v>

2679
02:11:43.190 --> 02:11:46.310
<v Speaker 3>Like those grey aliens with no genitals,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2680
02:11:46.690 --> 02:11:49.370
<v Speaker 3>and these different ideas of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a different way to do it.</v>

2681
02:11:49.371 --> 02:11:52.010
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those guys are looking at us like,</v>

2682
02:11:52.250 --> 02:11:53.880
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that must be fucking fun.</v>

2683
02:11:54.250 --> 02:11:55.600
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some shitty fights,</v>

2684
02:11:55.940 --> 02:11:58.250
<v Speaker 3>but it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could still get a muscle car.</v>

2685
02:11:58.251 --> 02:12:01.910
<v Speaker 3>They're still legal before they get to</v>
<v Speaker 3>this point where they're just going to</v>

2686
02:12:01.911 --> 02:12:06.911
<v Speaker 3>be these fucking automotive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These cars are going to be all automated</v>

2687
02:12:07.521 --> 02:12:09.380
<v Speaker 3>and everything's going to be self</v>
<v Speaker 3>driven.</v>

2688
02:12:09.381 --> 02:12:11.180
<v Speaker 3>There's going to be no excitement to</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

2689
02:12:11.450 --> 02:12:14.210
<v Speaker 3>And then there's gonna be no sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People are going to figure out a way to</v>

2690
02:12:14.211 --> 02:12:18.950
<v Speaker 3>make the same feeling that you get from</v>
<v Speaker 3>sex available on your command.</v>

2691
02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:21.440
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever been in the hospital and</v>

2692
02:12:21.441 --> 02:12:23.540
<v Speaker 3>they give you one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those morphine drips when you.</v>

2693
02:12:23.640 --> 02:12:28.640
<v Speaker 3>I got my knees operated on back in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>nineties and it was the real painful</v>

2694
02:12:29.481 --> 02:12:31.460
<v Speaker 3>method where they do the Patella tendon</v>
<v Speaker 3>graft,</v>

2695
02:12:31.461 --> 02:12:34.700
<v Speaker 3>so they cut a piece of bone out of your</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shin and take a strip out of your</v>

2696
02:12:34.701 --> 02:12:38.870
<v Speaker 3>patella tendon and they take a chunk of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bone and your Shin and they open you</v>

2697
02:12:38.871 --> 02:12:43.871
<v Speaker 3>up like a fish and then replace your acl</v>
<v Speaker 3>with this piece of your Patella is</v>

2698
02:12:44.181 --> 02:12:45.014
<v Speaker 3>painful as fuck.</v>

2699
02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:49.190
<v Speaker 3>And so when you're in the hospital they</v>
<v Speaker 3>immediately put you on this motion</v>

2700
02:12:49.191 --> 02:12:52.100
<v Speaker 3>machine and this motion machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your legs sits on this thing and it</v>

2701
02:12:52.101 --> 02:12:56.000
<v Speaker 3>constantly bends and straightens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bends and straight and spends is right</v>

2702
02:12:56.001 --> 02:12:58.970
<v Speaker 3>after the surgery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like immediately after and then they</v>

2703
02:12:58.971 --> 02:13:01.800
<v Speaker 3>give you this morphine button and every</v>
<v Speaker 3>time you hit that bitch</v>

2704
02:13:04.770 --> 02:13:09.710
<v Speaker 3>you just get just stoked up with</v>
<v Speaker 3>morphine and it's amazing.</v>

2705
02:13:09.711 --> 02:13:10.500
<v Speaker 3>You just sit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There you go,</v>

2706
02:13:10.500 --> 02:13:13.130
<v Speaker 3>Woo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the only time I've ever done quote</v>

2707
02:13:13.131 --> 02:13:14.630
<v Speaker 3>unquote morphine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've known,</v>

2708
02:13:14.660 --> 02:13:16.730
<v Speaker 3>I've never experienced like opiates</v>
<v Speaker 3>before.</v>

2709
02:13:16.760 --> 02:13:19.070
<v Speaker 3>Other than that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was fucking wild.</v>

2710
02:13:19.220 --> 02:13:19.790
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>

2711
02:13:19.790 --> 02:13:21.650
<v Speaker 3>good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This isn't available all the time,</v>

2712
02:13:21.950 --> 02:13:26.540
<v Speaker 3>but we could easily get to a point</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometime in the future where the idea of</v>

2713
02:13:26.840 --> 02:13:31.500
<v Speaker 3>going on tinder to try to find someone</v>
<v Speaker 3>to fuck is outrageously stupid.</v>

2714
02:13:31.740 --> 02:13:31.980
<v Speaker 3>Why</v>

2715
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:36.210
<v Speaker 1>would you do that when you can just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>how you plug in your phone to recharge</v>

2716
02:13:36.211 --> 02:13:37.510
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to plug in and</v>

2717
02:13:39.810 --> 02:13:42.860
<v Speaker 1>experiencing like the love of the mother</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gaia,</v>

2718
02:13:43.070 --> 02:13:46.020
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the swarming fractal.</v>

2719
02:13:46.021 --> 02:13:49.140
<v Speaker 1>Love that you get an a dmt experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pure.</v>

2720
02:13:49.430 --> 02:13:54.430
<v Speaker 1>Just pure pleasure and pure experience</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

2721
02:13:54.580 --> 02:13:59.580
<v Speaker 1>of just understanding and affection and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of it wrapped up in this warm,</v>

2722
02:14:01.020 --> 02:14:05.100
<v Speaker 1>beautiful accepting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>embrace or you know,</v>

2723
02:14:05.250 --> 02:14:07.140
<v Speaker 1>I told you this and you went and did</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

2724
02:14:07.141 --> 02:14:08.700
<v Speaker 1>and then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck you and you if I can,</v>

2725
02:14:08.760 --> 02:14:10.740
<v Speaker 1>you might fucking cheap my friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My friends tell me,</v>

2726
02:14:10.890 --> 02:14:12.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend Cheryl says,</v>

2727
02:14:12.460 --> 02:14:14.180
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>

2728
02:14:14.190 --> 02:14:15.440
<v Speaker 1>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do it anymore.</v>

2729
02:14:15.540 --> 02:14:17.940
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to do it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then because of the fact that people</v>

2730
02:14:17.941 --> 02:14:19.590
<v Speaker 1>kept doing this over and over and over</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

2731
02:14:20.260 --> 02:14:23.220
<v Speaker 1>our dicks has shrunk and shriveled up</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside of our bodies.</v>

2732
02:14:23.400 --> 02:14:26.190
<v Speaker 1>And then we become those gray aliens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we become.</v>

2733
02:14:26.370 --> 02:14:29.220
<v Speaker 1>We ruin our atmosphere to the point</v>
<v Speaker 1>where we have built in sunglasses,</v>

2734
02:14:29.221 --> 02:14:33.210
<v Speaker 1>those big goddamn black eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our heads become huge because we use</v>

2735
02:14:33.211 --> 02:14:34.620
<v Speaker 1>telekinesis now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2736
02:14:34.730 --> 02:14:37.080
<v Speaker 1>we don't want them to need muscles</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we don't pick anything up</v>

2737
02:14:37.081 --> 02:14:38.820
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you look at our muscles in</v>

2738
02:14:38.821 --> 02:14:40.530
<v Speaker 1>comparison to a champ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2739
02:14:40.531 --> 02:14:43.260
<v Speaker 1>look at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've seen those photos are of chimps</v>

2740
02:14:43.261 --> 02:14:47.070
<v Speaker 1>with mange hairless champs and like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ will,</v>

2741
02:14:47.071 --> 02:14:51.030
<v Speaker 1>they have to have muscles like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's how they get the trend is clear,</v>

2742
02:14:51.220 --> 02:14:52.530
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which way we're going.</v>

2743
02:14:52.620 --> 02:14:55.620
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's just now is an opportunity to just</v>

2744
02:14:55.621 --> 02:14:58.680
<v Speaker 1>really enjoy the shit out of it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they know because it's going to go,</v>

2745
02:14:58.770 --> 02:15:00.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think at some point,</v>

2746
02:15:00.380 --> 02:15:03.540
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there will be some good aspects</v>

2747
02:15:03.541 --> 02:15:04.260
<v Speaker 1>of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2748
02:15:04.260 --> 02:15:07.320
<v Speaker 1>I think for sure there'll be generally</v>
<v Speaker 1>some less suffering.</v>

2749
02:15:07.320 --> 02:15:11.160
<v Speaker 1>But this is if I had to choose what</v>
<v Speaker 1>level of the video game I want to play,</v>

2750
02:15:11.161 --> 02:15:12.850
<v Speaker 1>like I'm going to be here now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2751
02:15:13.080 --> 02:15:15.300
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the cool time for me.</v>

2752
02:15:15.301 --> 02:15:17.520
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there are ways to do that.</v>

2753
02:15:17.521 --> 02:15:19.290
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we think of it technologically,</v>

2754
02:15:19.291 --> 02:15:21.960
<v Speaker 1>but I think at the plants as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

2755
02:15:21.961 --> 02:15:26.961
<v Speaker 1>like smoking dmt is a technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a way to administer dmt</v>

2756
02:15:27.391 --> 02:15:31.230
<v Speaker 1>molecules that don't get broken down</v>
<v Speaker 1>immediately because there's such a flood</v>

2757
02:15:31.470 --> 02:15:35.130
<v Speaker 1>that it actually crosses the blood brain</v>
<v Speaker 1>barrier and you have that experience of</v>

2758
02:15:35.131 --> 02:15:37.860
<v Speaker 1>swirling guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2759
02:15:37.861 --> 02:15:40.980
<v Speaker 1>and it's just like looking at that like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is tech,</v>

2760
02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:42.870
<v Speaker 1>this isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is drugs,</v>

2761
02:15:42.980 --> 02:15:44.550
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is technology.</v>

2762
02:15:44.580 --> 02:15:46.140
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird word though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Technology,</v>

2763
02:15:46.141 --> 02:15:47.670
<v Speaker 1>we think about metal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2764
02:15:47.700 --> 02:15:51.870
<v Speaker 1>we do wires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But really to me that's a better way to</v>

2765
02:15:51.871 --> 02:15:52.681
<v Speaker 1>look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2766
02:15:52.681 --> 02:15:54.780
<v Speaker 1>because drugs carry all these</v>
<v Speaker 1>connotations.</v>

2767
02:15:54.780 --> 02:15:58.590
<v Speaker 1>And I was at a cure for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just this is a technology that</v>

2768
02:15:58.591 --> 02:16:02.520
<v Speaker 1>allows this certain element of humanity</v>
<v Speaker 1>to unlock.</v>

2769
02:16:02.521 --> 02:16:05.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like a key to a lock and you hit</v>
<v Speaker 1>that right.</v>

2770
02:16:05.580 --> 02:16:06.413
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

2771
02:16:06.540 --> 02:16:09.510
<v Speaker 1>You don't always want to unlock all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>doors either though,</v>

2772
02:16:09.540 --> 02:16:11.880
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean in my recent experience,</v>

2773
02:16:11.881 --> 02:16:14.340
<v Speaker 1>I pushed it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pushed it to a level where I could</v>

2774
02:16:14.341 --> 02:16:18.480
<v Speaker 1>really see like fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you could get down into some weird,</v>

2775
02:16:18.930 --> 02:16:21.120
<v Speaker 1>weird waters where you're entering a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot,</v>

2776
02:16:21.270 --> 02:16:23.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you don't really know if you're</v>

2777
02:16:23.371 --> 02:16:24.690
<v Speaker 1>going to come back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2778
02:16:24.691 --> 02:16:25.710
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I,</v>

2779
02:16:25.711 --> 02:16:28.260
<v Speaker 1>I definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I announced on my own podcast was like,</v>

2780
02:16:28.261 --> 02:16:30.010
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm done with that</v>

2781
02:16:30.130 --> 02:16:33.280
<v Speaker 2>type of exploration of the plants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just want to play,</v>

2782
02:16:33.550 --> 02:16:38.320
<v Speaker 2>hang out and experience them for fun.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But going intentionally that deep with</v>

2783
02:16:38.321 --> 02:16:39.280
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2784
02:16:39.340 --> 02:16:40.930
<v Speaker 2>you have to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to have caution.</v>

2785
02:16:40.960 --> 02:16:43.330
<v Speaker 2>Plus it's a predatory universe out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

2786
02:16:43.331 --> 02:16:45.370
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of these Iowaska shamans and a lot</v>

2787
02:16:45.371 --> 02:16:47.560
<v Speaker 2>of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't always have your best</v>

2788
02:16:47.561 --> 02:16:49.150
<v Speaker 2>interests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They come from the jungle where the</v>

2789
02:16:49.151 --> 02:16:51.440
<v Speaker 2>strong eat the weak.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what people gotta realize.</v>

2790
02:16:51.441 --> 02:16:55.240
<v Speaker 2>Like in the jungle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the strongest Jaguar eats all things.</v>

2791
02:16:55.600 --> 02:16:57.670
<v Speaker 2>All these Shamans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their head animal,</v>

2792
02:16:57.850 --> 02:17:01.000
<v Speaker 2>most of moons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Toronto is the Jaguar who eats all</v>

2793
02:17:01.001 --> 02:17:04.060
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you got to realize like a lot of</v>

2794
02:17:04.061 --> 02:17:07.060
<v Speaker 2>those motherfuckers you're trying to eat</v>
<v Speaker 2>you like they're trying to eat you.</v>

2795
02:17:07.061 --> 02:17:10.630
<v Speaker 2>So be really super careful with it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But look at it,</v>

2796
02:17:10.631 --> 02:17:11.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>without bias,</v>

2797
02:17:11.741 --> 02:17:15.400
<v Speaker 2>look at it like this is a technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this technology going to be useful</v>

2798
02:17:15.401 --> 02:17:18.010
<v Speaker 2>for me?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I ready to explore this technology?</v>

2799
02:17:18.220 --> 02:17:20.950
<v Speaker 2>If so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do it appropriately and responsibly and</v>

2800
02:17:20.951 --> 02:17:22.300
<v Speaker 2>it can be really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really valuable.</v>

2801
02:17:22.330 --> 02:17:25.120
<v Speaker 2>But then no one that technology's no</v>
<v Speaker 2>longer serving you,</v>

2802
02:17:25.400 --> 02:17:28.760
<v Speaker 3>isn't it one of those things like we've</v>
<v Speaker 3>been talking about where there's no,</v>

2803
02:17:28.820 --> 02:17:32.450
<v Speaker 3>it's not a clear good or bad,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's not a clear yes or no.</v>

2804
02:17:32.451 --> 02:17:33.231
<v Speaker 3>There's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2805
02:17:33.231 --> 02:17:36.230
<v Speaker 3>well if you meet a showman,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he will absolutely be pure.</v>

2806
02:17:36.930 --> 02:17:38.070
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck no,</v>

2807
02:17:38.190 --> 02:17:39.440
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not at all.</v>

2808
02:17:39.530 --> 02:17:41.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's just a mixed bag just</v>
<v Speaker 3>like puke.</v>

2809
02:17:41.850 --> 02:17:44.480
<v Speaker 3>It's like any human,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is this going to be a good guy or bad</v>

2810
02:17:44.481 --> 02:17:46.940
<v Speaker 3>guys can be someone's helpful or not</v>
<v Speaker 3>helpful.</v>

2811
02:17:46.941 --> 02:17:49.190
<v Speaker 3>That's why stereotypes are so fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>problematic.</v>

2812
02:17:49.550 --> 02:17:51.110
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you meet a girl and she's beautiful,</v>

2813
02:17:51.111 --> 02:17:52.800
<v Speaker 3>you assume she's dummy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2814
02:17:53.250 --> 02:17:55.190
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the standard,</v>

2815
02:17:55.191 --> 02:17:56.840
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because beautiful people don't have to</v>

2816
02:17:56.841 --> 02:18:00.170
<v Speaker 3>try as hard as soon as she's taking it</v>
<v Speaker 3>easy and she slacked off.</v>

2817
02:18:00.290 --> 02:18:04.460
<v Speaker 3>It's just a lot of people meet these</v>
<v Speaker 3>people from indigenous cultures and say,</v>

2818
02:18:04.490 --> 02:18:05.780
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're indigenous.</v>

2819
02:18:07.860 --> 02:18:09.410
<v Speaker 3>One Slash 16th,</v>
<v Speaker 3>native American,</v>

2820
02:18:09.770 --> 02:18:10.603
<v Speaker 3>spiritual,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2821
02:18:10.700 --> 02:18:13.100
<v Speaker 3>He's got extra magic and he's in</v>
<v Speaker 3>medicine.</v>

2822
02:18:13.130 --> 02:18:15.110
<v Speaker 3>Man's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He made the barefoot.</v>

2823
02:18:16.010 --> 02:18:19.070
<v Speaker 3>He may just be trying to fuck everybody</v>
<v Speaker 3>in his village and take your money.</v>

2824
02:18:21.190 --> 02:18:24.280
<v Speaker 2>Other people who are genuinely like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gandalf,</v>

2825
02:18:24.281 --> 02:18:25.690
<v Speaker 2>the white wizard where you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck,</v>

2826
02:18:25.691 --> 02:18:28.120
<v Speaker 2>that's Gandalf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The white wizard I just encountered and</v>

2827
02:18:28.121 --> 02:18:30.250
<v Speaker 2>it's awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just you got to use your</v>

2828
02:18:30.251 --> 02:18:31.840
<v Speaker 2>instincts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta be you gotTa.</v>

2829
02:18:31.841 --> 02:18:35.380
<v Speaker 2>Be Keen to the situation and know what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're getting into because it's a.</v>

2830
02:18:35.620 --> 02:18:39.880
<v Speaker 2>it's a crazy wild world that we know</v>
<v Speaker 2>very little about compared to,</v>

2831
02:18:40.050 --> 02:18:41.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these external technology.</v>

2832
02:18:42.040 --> 02:18:45.190
<v Speaker 3>Well also the fact that it's been</v>
<v Speaker 3>suppressed has become such a huge issue</v>

2833
02:18:45.191 --> 02:18:48.010
<v Speaker 3>that we have to go to these South</v>
<v Speaker 3>American countries to get it.</v>

2834
02:18:48.370 --> 02:18:49.061
<v Speaker 3>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2835
02:18:49.061 --> 02:18:52.720
<v Speaker 3>if you want to go to get a massage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can go to Burke Williams and I</v>

2836
02:18:52.721 --> 02:18:55.720
<v Speaker 3>guarantee you they will give you an</v>
<v Speaker 3>excellent massage by a qualified</v>

2837
02:18:55.721 --> 02:18:57.340
<v Speaker 3>technician.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's going to fucking rob your</v>

2838
02:18:57.341 --> 02:18:58.600
<v Speaker 3>wallet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what?</v>

2839
02:18:58.610 --> 02:19:00.700
<v Speaker 3>They have established a business and an</v>
<v Speaker 3>ethic.</v>

2840
02:19:00.790 --> 02:19:03.550
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of places like that where</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go and you can,</v>

2841
02:19:03.580 --> 02:19:06.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can go and experience a really good</v>

2842
02:19:06.131 --> 02:19:08.620
<v Speaker 3>service because it's legal in because we</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

2843
02:19:08.650 --> 02:19:11.050
<v Speaker 3>we don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no consequences for engaging in</v>

2844
02:19:11.051 --> 02:19:13.510
<v Speaker 3>that action,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the consequences of the United</v>

2845
02:19:13.510 --> 02:19:17.650
<v Speaker 3>States are so extreme that people have</v>
<v Speaker 3>to fly to the fucking jungle to take</v>

2846
02:19:17.651 --> 02:19:20.570
<v Speaker 3>something that your own brain produces.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>

2847
02:19:20.600 --> 02:19:23.620
<v Speaker 3>It's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's so weird that there's these</v>

2848
02:19:23.650 --> 02:19:28.160
<v Speaker 3>destinations that you have to go to to</v>
<v Speaker 3>explore that your</v>

2849
02:19:28.220 --> 02:19:32.900
<v Speaker 1>own fucking pineal gland produces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the only reason why is because we</v>

2850
02:19:32.901 --> 02:19:34.730
<v Speaker 1>make it illegal here in the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

2851
02:19:34.970 --> 02:19:37.340
<v Speaker 1>They should have calabasas IOWASCA</v>
<v Speaker 1>centers.</v>

2852
02:19:37.670 --> 02:19:41.000
<v Speaker 1>We should be able to go right down the</v>
<v Speaker 1>street from Kim Kardashians House and</v>

2853
02:19:41.001 --> 02:19:43.030
<v Speaker 1>get fucking fueled up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we,</v>

2854
02:19:43.050 --> 02:19:45.660
<v Speaker 1>we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not there yet and if who knows</v>

2855
02:19:45.661 --> 02:19:48.110
<v Speaker 1>what we're ever going to get there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me though that that's the</v>

2856
02:19:48.111 --> 02:19:49.700
<v Speaker 1>trend it seems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2857
02:19:49.750 --> 02:19:51.800
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely in so many different ways.</v>

2858
02:19:51.860 --> 02:19:55.970
<v Speaker 1>There's all these ponies in the race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was pretty much there with a religious</v>

2859
02:19:55.971 --> 02:19:58.280
<v Speaker 1>exemption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like was that church that just opened up</v>

2860
02:19:58.281 --> 02:19:59.960
<v Speaker 1>in Washington?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't recommend it.</v>

2861
02:19:59.961 --> 02:20:01.760
<v Speaker 1>From what I've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously haven't been there,</v>

2862
02:20:02.000 --> 02:20:04.550
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a very select group that I.</v>

2863
02:20:04.551 --> 02:20:06.130
<v Speaker 1>What is the church in Washington?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is there?</v>

2864
02:20:06.170 --> 02:20:09.870
<v Speaker 1>It's a nondenominational IOWASCA church.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the Church has Santa Diamond.</v>

2865
02:20:09.880 --> 02:20:13.310
<v Speaker 1>That church of UDV.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm already got religious exemption</v>

2866
02:20:13.311 --> 02:20:16.430
<v Speaker 1>approval cream court by the supreme</v>
<v Speaker 1>court twice.</v>

2867
02:20:16.480 --> 02:20:17.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2868
02:20:17.060 --> 02:20:21.370
<v Speaker 1>So one more time and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fully like everything is going to</v>

2869
02:20:21.440 --> 02:20:23.390
<v Speaker 1>be a good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're doing full Iowa.</v>

2870
02:20:23.430 --> 02:20:27.200
<v Speaker 1>Rick Strassman Ios.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rick strassman did it with them and he's</v>

2871
02:20:27.201 --> 02:20:29.740
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were these golf shirts like they</v>

2872
02:20:29.800 --> 02:20:34.800
<v Speaker 1>have like a little outfit and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting blasted with like insanely</v>

2873
02:20:35.061 --> 02:20:38.570
<v Speaker 1>powerful IOWASCA and they're singing</v>
<v Speaker 1>songs about Jesus.</v>

2874
02:20:39.310 --> 02:20:42.490
<v Speaker 1>Then that's the weird part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'll sing songs about Jesus if you</v>

2875
02:20:42.590 --> 02:20:45.980
<v Speaker 1>get me high enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then the church in Washington was</v>

2876
02:20:45.981 --> 02:20:46.550
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck it,</v>

2877
02:20:46.550 --> 02:20:49.310
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be nondenominational so</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not going to sing songs about</v>

2878
02:20:49.311 --> 02:20:50.720
<v Speaker 1>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're just going to be a church.</v>

2879
02:20:50.960 --> 02:20:53.300
<v Speaker 1>And so we're waiting to kind of see what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens with that.</v>

2880
02:20:53.301 --> 02:20:55.610
<v Speaker 1>But that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's already coming and then</v>

2881
02:20:55.820 --> 02:20:59.480
<v Speaker 1>psilocybin is coming for approval as</v>
<v Speaker 1>medicine,</v>

2882
02:20:59.481 --> 02:21:01.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johns Hopkins is doing amazing research</v>

2883
02:21:01.521 --> 02:21:04.070
<v Speaker 1>on that for both palliative care and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>variety of other thing.</v>

2884
02:21:04.370 --> 02:21:07.040
<v Speaker 1>MTMA for posttraumatic stress is coming</v>
<v Speaker 1>online.</v>

2885
02:21:07.310 --> 02:21:11.450
<v Speaker 1>Marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just by sheer sensibility and numbers is</v>

2886
02:21:11.451 --> 02:21:15.260
<v Speaker 1>going to be legal at some point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like all of these ponies are in the</v>

2887
02:21:15.261 --> 02:21:18.590
<v Speaker 1>race and I think they're all going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>come to fruition somewhere in the next</v>

2888
02:21:18.591 --> 02:21:19.400
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 years,</v>

2889
02:21:19.400 --> 02:21:21.800
<v Speaker 1>while also the information that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet is providing.</v>

2890
02:21:21.830 --> 02:21:25.100
<v Speaker 1>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can go online today and find all the</v>

2891
02:21:25.101 --> 02:21:29.300
<v Speaker 1>different things that marijuana is good</v>
<v Speaker 1>at and then find out the fact that it's</v>

2892
02:21:29.301 --> 02:21:31.730
<v Speaker 1>a schedule one drug,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States of America and you go,</v>

2893
02:21:31.820 --> 02:21:34.020
<v Speaker 1>oh well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever's making the schedules a</v>

2894
02:21:34.021 --> 02:21:37.700
<v Speaker 1>criminal and it's real simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got this plant that you can eat,</v>

2895
02:21:37.701 --> 02:21:40.700
<v Speaker 1>you could eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could use it to make a fuel for a</v>

2896
02:21:40.701 --> 02:21:42.800
<v Speaker 1>lamp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He could build a fucking house out of</v>

2897
02:21:42.801 --> 02:21:44.750
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can make clothes with it,</v>

2898
02:21:44.870 --> 02:21:48.170
<v Speaker 1>you can make paper with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can essentially make everything with</v>

2899
02:21:48.171 --> 02:21:48.410
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2900
02:21:48.410 --> 02:21:50.920
<v Speaker 1>You need to get a hemp stock,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to get a piece like,</v>

2901
02:21:50.940 --> 02:21:52.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm going gonna,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to order you one.</v>

2902
02:21:52.550 --> 02:21:55.400
<v Speaker 1>We'll get some.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it is a tree grows large,</v>

2903
02:21:55.401 --> 02:22:00.401
<v Speaker 1>it gets fat like like a forearm and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>weighs nothing and it's hard as a rock.</v>

2904
02:22:00.921 --> 02:22:03.770
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking alien.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so weird.</v>

2905
02:22:03.771 --> 02:22:05.960
<v Speaker 1>It's not like any other plant that</v>
<v Speaker 1>exists on earth.</v>

2906
02:22:05.961 --> 02:22:10.160
<v Speaker 1>It's so strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these laws that are in place,</v>

2907
02:22:10.161 --> 02:22:13.550
<v Speaker 1>we're all in place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back when information was difficult to</v>

2908
02:22:13.551 --> 02:22:17.450
<v Speaker 1>come by back when you had to get it</v>
<v Speaker 1>through these selected media sources</v>

2909
02:22:17.451 --> 02:22:21.080
<v Speaker 1>like newspapers or television shows and</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody was confused.</v>

2910
02:22:21.320 --> 02:22:24.110
<v Speaker 1>Everybody was worried they were going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>go crazy like reefer madness and jump</v>

2911
02:22:24.111 --> 02:22:26.100
<v Speaker 1>off a building or stab white women</v>

2912
02:22:26.310 --> 02:22:29.610
<v Speaker 3>when nobody knew they they didn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now we do know.</v>

2913
02:22:29.640 --> 02:22:34.640
<v Speaker 3>So now that we do know those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those nonsensical non reality based</v>

2914
02:22:37.170 --> 02:22:40.470
<v Speaker 3>perceptions are eroding their roading</v>
<v Speaker 3>right before our eyes.</v>

2915
02:22:40.760 --> 02:22:43.410
<v Speaker 3>In the line of it is things like</v>
<v Speaker 3>podcasts.</v>

2916
02:22:43.770 --> 02:22:46.560
<v Speaker 3>A lot of his things like Ted talks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lectures,</v>

2917
02:22:46.680 --> 02:22:49.290
<v Speaker 3>people explaining the actual reality of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2918
02:22:49.320 --> 02:22:51.630
<v Speaker 3>information,</v>
<v Speaker 3>social media,</v>

2919
02:22:51.900 --> 02:22:56.900
<v Speaker 3>stories that are being printed in online</v>
<v Speaker 3>media sources where they explain like</v>

2920
02:22:57.720 --> 02:23:01.320
<v Speaker 3>the actual effects of these drugs that</v>
<v Speaker 3>John Hopkins studies where you can,</v>

2921
02:23:01.350 --> 02:23:06.350
<v Speaker 3>you can read in New York Times the</v>
<v Speaker 3>benefits of Psilocybin for people who</v>

2922
02:23:07.020 --> 02:23:11.490
<v Speaker 3>are experiencing the the end of life</v>
<v Speaker 3>relieving of pressure of people that are</v>

2923
02:23:11.700 --> 02:23:16.700
<v Speaker 3>terrified about dying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People who have had some serious</v>

2924
02:23:16.950 --> 02:23:21.950
<v Speaker 3>traumatic abuse in their life and their</v>
<v Speaker 3>being cured of the burden of that with</v>

2925
02:23:22.051 --> 02:23:27.051
<v Speaker 3>psychedelic medicines and it's bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's bizarre the time that we live in</v>

2926
02:23:28.620 --> 02:23:31.650
<v Speaker 3>and that all these things are sort of</v>
<v Speaker 3>sprouting out of the earth.</v>

2927
02:23:31.890 --> 02:23:36.270
<v Speaker 3>They've been suppressed and stuffed into</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ground by these people that were</v>

2928
02:23:36.300 --> 02:23:40.230
<v Speaker 3>essentially the enemies of information</v>
<v Speaker 3>that they were distributing false</v>

2929
02:23:40.231 --> 02:23:42.540
<v Speaker 3>information,</v>
<v Speaker 3>suppressing the real information.</v>

2930
02:23:42.541 --> 02:23:47.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean Nixon was the enemy of</v>
<v Speaker 3>information because he sponsored these</v>

2931
02:23:47.460 --> 02:23:51.390
<v Speaker 3>studies to show how bad marijuana was</v>
<v Speaker 3>and when it turned out,</v>

2932
02:23:51.391 --> 02:23:53.340
<v Speaker 3>the marijuana is actually not bad at</v>
<v Speaker 3>all.</v>

2933
02:23:53.580 --> 02:23:57.840
<v Speaker 3>They suppress that information.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's actually the enemy of data.</v>

2934
02:23:58.140 --> 02:24:01.410
<v Speaker 3>He'll like push that data down into the</v>
<v Speaker 3>ground and never released it,</v>

2935
02:24:01.620 --> 02:24:06.620
<v Speaker 3>but now it's just just through sheer</v>
<v Speaker 3>truth is popping through the earth and</v>

2936
02:24:06.811 --> 02:24:11.811
<v Speaker 3>you're seeing Colorado experiencing</v>
<v Speaker 3>record revenues and taxes and when that</v>

2937
02:24:12.571 --> 02:24:17.070
<v Speaker 3>happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then all the evil people who quote</v>

2938
02:24:17.071 --> 02:24:21.240
<v Speaker 3>unquote the people that are</v>
<v Speaker 3>concentrating solely on numbers on money</v>

2939
02:24:21.690 --> 02:24:26.660
<v Speaker 3>now they're involved because you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about a state in Colorado that's</v>

2940
02:24:26.670 --> 02:24:30.720
<v Speaker 3>made more money from taxes from</v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana than they did from alcohol</v>

2941
02:24:30.721 --> 02:24:33.150
<v Speaker 3>last year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is fucking insane.</v>

2942
02:24:33.570 --> 02:24:38.570
<v Speaker 3>But Tulsa Pot people don't mind paying</v>
<v Speaker 3>39 percent taxes if you make it legal</v>

2943
02:24:38.790 --> 02:24:41.040
<v Speaker 3>because then what's the joint?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Seven bucks instead of five.</v>

2944
02:24:41.130 --> 02:24:42.090
<v Speaker 3>Fuck it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's do it.</v>

2945
02:24:42.200 --> 02:24:42.840
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2946
02:24:42.840 --> 02:24:45.150
<v Speaker 3>seven bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And your blast that off your head for</v>

2947
02:24:45.151 --> 02:24:49.480
<v Speaker 3>like the next 10 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you understand like how much drinking</v>

2948
02:24:49.520 --> 02:24:52.260
<v Speaker 3>costs?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know if you get a drink at a bar,</v>

2949
02:24:52.261 --> 02:24:53.910
<v Speaker 3>like what is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know what a drink cost.</v>

2950
02:24:54.750 --> 02:24:55.583
<v Speaker 3>10 Bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

2951
02:24:55.950 --> 02:24:57.330
<v Speaker 3>So what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Two drinks?</v>

2952
02:24:57.331 --> 02:25:00.510
<v Speaker 3>20 bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>20 bucks worth of pot will fuck you up</v>

2953
02:25:00.511 --> 02:25:04.590
<v Speaker 3>for a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get 20 bucks worth of marijuana.</v>

2954
02:25:04.770 --> 02:25:08.590
<v Speaker 3>Like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can smoke like three hits a day for</v>

2955
02:25:08.670 --> 02:25:11.400
<v Speaker 3>four or five days in a row on 20 bucks</v>
<v Speaker 3>worth of weed.</v>

2956
02:25:11.940 --> 02:25:12.751
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no doubt.</v>

2957
02:25:12.751 --> 02:25:15.060
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a chronicle,</v>

2958
02:25:15.090 --> 02:25:18.540
<v Speaker 3>it's economical and it's inescapable</v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

2959
02:25:18.620 --> 02:25:19.800
<v Speaker 3>Like they've let the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2960
02:25:19.820 --> 02:25:22.200
<v Speaker 3>that oppression can only work when it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>tight.</v>

2961
02:25:22.320 --> 02:25:24.030
<v Speaker 3>When you start to like the</v>

2962
02:25:24.320 --> 02:25:27.760
<v Speaker 2>plants growing up through the concrete,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the concrete starts to break off and all</v>

2963
02:25:27.761 --> 02:25:30.310
<v Speaker 2>of a sudden it returns the jungle again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't,</v>

2964
02:25:30.640 --> 02:25:33.640
<v Speaker 2>you can't keep this stuff down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was actually,</v>

2965
02:25:33.641 --> 02:25:36.070
<v Speaker 2>I had dinner with the maps people at my</v>
<v Speaker 2>house,</v>

2966
02:25:36.071 --> 02:25:38.620
<v Speaker 2>a little charity dinner and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>presented some of the new data that was</v>

2967
02:25:38.621 --> 02:25:41.080
<v Speaker 2>coming out from their recent study on</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mtma.</v>

2968
02:25:41.740 --> 02:25:46.720
<v Speaker 2>Unbelievable results for treating PTSD.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So to give it like a quick summary,</v>

2969
02:25:46.990 --> 02:25:50.770
<v Speaker 2>posttraumatic stress has a scale and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>scale goes from zero to 1:30.</v>

2970
02:25:50.771 --> 02:25:55.060
<v Speaker 2>One 30 is like the most incomprehensible</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of terrible shit that's happened</v>

2971
02:25:55.061 --> 02:25:57.760
<v Speaker 2>to you possible lived in a cage your</v>
<v Speaker 2>whole life,</v>

2972
02:25:57.761 --> 02:25:58.900
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tortured forever.</v>

2973
02:25:59.320 --> 02:26:03.130
<v Speaker 2>Most people have a certain amount,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like five of skift score of five or 10.</v>

2974
02:26:03.131 --> 02:26:04.930
<v Speaker 2>There's always been bad shit that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to people,</v>

2975
02:26:04.931 --> 02:26:07.540
<v Speaker 2>but like the threshold is somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 2>around 50.</v>

2976
02:26:07.940 --> 02:26:10.090
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything over 50 year actually</v>

2977
02:26:10.120 --> 02:26:14.320
<v Speaker 2>diagnosable with ptsd and in the kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>medical record as far as I understand</v>

2978
02:26:14.321 --> 02:26:16.660
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so in their recent studies,</v>

2979
02:26:16.690 --> 02:26:18.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're getting an average of people</v>

2980
02:26:18.311 --> 02:26:22.720
<v Speaker 2>with treatment resistant ptsd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means the drugs didn't work and</v>

2981
02:26:22.721 --> 02:26:24.670
<v Speaker 2>what the drugs showed and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>combination of,</v>

2982
02:26:24.671 --> 02:26:28.690
<v Speaker 2>I believe Paxil and Zoloft with the drug</v>
<v Speaker 2>showed is they were able with consistent</v>

2983
02:26:28.691 --> 02:26:32.320
<v Speaker 2>application to reduce that score like</v>
<v Speaker 2>six to 10 points,</v>

2984
02:26:32.350 --> 02:26:35.620
<v Speaker 2>so from like 70 to 60,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so still pretty fucked up.</v>

2985
02:26:35.621 --> 02:26:37.780
<v Speaker 2>You're not down like in the normal</v>
<v Speaker 2>range,</v>

2986
02:26:37.781 --> 02:26:41.260
<v Speaker 2>which is somewhere around 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reduced it from 70 to 60.</v>

2987
02:26:41.350 --> 02:26:44.830
<v Speaker 2>With the MTMA assisted psychotherapy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's three sessions,</v>

2988
02:26:45.040 --> 02:26:47.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they took Mtma three times with a</v>

2989
02:26:47.361 --> 02:26:52.361
<v Speaker 2>therapist and it reduced it like 50</v>
<v Speaker 2>points and not only did it reduce it 50</v>

2990
02:26:52.991 --> 02:26:57.991
<v Speaker 2>points instead of 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it continued to drop over the next three</v>

2991
02:26:58.001 --> 02:27:01.460
<v Speaker 2>years that they observe them without any</v>
<v Speaker 2>utilization of mdms.</v>

2992
02:27:01.870 --> 02:27:04.810
<v Speaker 2>So it's like instead of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this constant treatment,</v>

2993
02:27:05.230 --> 02:27:09.910
<v Speaker 2>there's a cure potentially out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's available where three times you</v>

2994
02:27:09.911 --> 02:27:14.050
<v Speaker 2>do this thing and of course you know the</v>
<v Speaker 2>psychotherapy isn't to be ignored.</v>

2995
02:27:14.051 --> 02:27:16.990
<v Speaker 2>That's an important part of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Mtma assisted psychotherapy,</v>

2996
02:27:16.991 --> 02:27:20.290
<v Speaker 2>not just willy nilly taking the drugs</v>
<v Speaker 2>and hold someone that guide you and</v>

2997
02:27:20.590 --> 02:27:24.520
<v Speaker 2>guiding you through into these</v>
<v Speaker 2>situations and it's amazingly powerful</v>

2998
02:27:24.521 --> 02:27:27.610
<v Speaker 2>and this is a disease that affects or</v>
<v Speaker 2>disorder rather,</v>

2999
02:27:27.611 --> 02:27:31.150
<v Speaker 2>that affects so many millions of people</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are suffering and you just have</v>

3000
02:27:31.151 --> 02:27:35.650
<v Speaker 2>something there on the fringe with this</v>
<v Speaker 2>data coming out and pretty soon it</v>

3001
02:27:35.651 --> 02:27:40.300
<v Speaker 2>becomes incredibly unethical to keep</v>
<v Speaker 2>this illegal when the data is showing</v>

3002
02:27:40.301 --> 02:27:43.300
<v Speaker 2>that much promise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like any other pharmaceutical drug that</v>

3003
02:27:43.301 --> 02:27:45.640
<v Speaker 2>could be patentable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that showed that much promise and doing</v>

3004
02:27:45.641 --> 02:27:50.040
<v Speaker 2>something fast tracked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it would be like like that a act</v>

3005
02:27:50.050 --> 02:27:52.840
<v Speaker 2>drug which ended up not working,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when everybody's afraid of aids and</v>

3006
02:27:52.880 --> 02:27:55.480
<v Speaker 2>like this may work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden that shit was legal in</v>

3007
02:27:55.481 --> 02:27:58.240
<v Speaker 2>like six months because people were</v>
<v Speaker 2>freaked out.</v>

3008
02:27:58.510 --> 02:28:01.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's what should happen with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mgma and we'll see if it does.</v>

3009
02:28:01.961 --> 02:28:03.610
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because when this data is presented,</v>

3010
02:28:03.611 --> 02:28:07.690
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be such a convincing case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really becomes unethical not to use</v>

3011
02:28:07.691 --> 02:28:07.860
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

3012
02:28:07.860 --> 02:28:11.730
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think we're also in a world now where</v>

3013
02:28:11.940 --> 02:28:16.940
<v Speaker 3>children are growing up and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>growing up from the time they're a baby.</v>

3014
02:28:17.101 --> 02:28:20.760
<v Speaker 3>They have access to the Internet and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>culture that exists today is so</v>

3015
02:28:20.761 --> 02:28:25.761
<v Speaker 3>radically than the culture pre 1994 that</v>
<v Speaker 3>the children that are born in 1994 have</v>

3016
02:28:28.100 --> 02:28:30.320
<v Speaker 3>now they have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're 20 years old,</v>

3017
02:28:30.640 --> 02:28:35.640
<v Speaker 3>you know now they're adults and they've</v>
<v Speaker 3>grown up with the Internet from the time</v>

3018
02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:39.140
<v Speaker 3>they were babies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those are the people that are just not</v>

3019
02:28:39.141 --> 02:28:43.760
<v Speaker 3>going to accept the laws that are in</v>
<v Speaker 3>place as they get older and they become</v>

3020
02:28:44.300 --> 02:28:48.200
<v Speaker 3>leaders and politicians and they're</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to have a completely different</v>

3021
02:28:48.201 --> 02:28:53.201
<v Speaker 3>idea than some of these old wacky fucks</v>
<v Speaker 3>that are just they.</v>

3022
02:28:53.441 --> 02:28:56.300
<v Speaker 3>They're operating on a false paradigm</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're operating with,</v>

3023
02:28:56.330 --> 02:28:59.780
<v Speaker 3>with bad information and they're the</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

3024
02:28:59.810 --> 02:29:01.370
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's undeniable.</v>

3025
02:29:01.371 --> 02:29:04.040
<v Speaker 3>It's concrete and solid to them just</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't,</v>

3026
02:29:04.270 --> 02:29:06.290
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bull drugs are bad and it's bad for your</v>

3027
02:29:06.291 --> 02:29:06.710
<v Speaker 3>brain.</v>

3028
02:29:06.710 --> 02:29:08.510
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a conversation with Michio Kaku</v>

3029
02:29:08.511 --> 02:29:11.450
<v Speaker 3>once when I was on the opiod,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anthony Show when I was asking him</v>

3030
02:29:11.480 --> 02:29:12.200
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3031
02:29:12.200 --> 02:29:15.680
<v Speaker 3>about psychedelic drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forgot what I was asking them about,</v>

3032
02:29:16.070 --> 02:29:16.521
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3033
02:29:16.521 --> 02:29:17.340
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3034
02:29:17.340 --> 02:29:20.450
<v Speaker 3>we know scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're trying to expand our brain.</v>

3035
02:29:20.451 --> 02:29:22.490
<v Speaker 3>We don't want to give ourselves brain</v>
<v Speaker 3>damage.</v>

3036
02:29:22.670 --> 02:29:27.670
<v Speaker 3>I gave this idea that you would ruin</v>
<v Speaker 3>your brain by doing mushrooms.</v>

3037
02:29:28.131 --> 02:29:28.300
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3038
02:29:28.300 --> 02:29:29.540
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've never done mushrooms,</v>

3039
02:29:29.541 --> 02:29:30.740
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you ever done mushrooms?</v>

3040
02:29:30.741 --> 02:29:32.810
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't do it because I don't want to</v>

3041
02:29:32.811 --> 02:29:34.430
<v Speaker 3>ruin my brain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to expand my.</v>

3042
02:29:34.610 --> 02:29:35.210
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3043
02:29:35.210 --> 02:29:36.770
<v Speaker 3>you don't understand what you're saying</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you're,</v>

3044
02:29:36.780 --> 02:29:38.630
<v Speaker 3>you're talking about something that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't,</v>

3045
02:29:38.840 --> 02:29:41.870
<v Speaker 3>you've never experienced.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you have this idea in your head that</v>

3046
02:29:41.871 --> 02:29:45.470
<v Speaker 3>it's bad for you based on what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Based on propaganda.</v>

3047
02:29:45.471 --> 02:29:46.460
<v Speaker 3>But then I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3048
02:29:46.461 --> 02:29:49.370
<v Speaker 3>he's in academia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>being an academia,</v>

3049
02:29:49.400 --> 02:29:50.101
<v Speaker 3>purdue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3050
02:29:50.101 --> 02:29:51.230
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing lectures,</v>

3051
02:29:51.231 --> 02:29:54.470
<v Speaker 3>do you use it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would radically limit his income,</v>

3052
02:29:54.710 --> 02:29:57.920
<v Speaker 3>radically limit his exposure if he came</v>
<v Speaker 3>out and started saying,</v>

3053
02:29:58.190 --> 02:29:58.851
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

3054
02:29:58.851 --> 02:30:00.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really in favor of people trying</v>

3055
02:30:00.981 --> 02:30:04.490
<v Speaker 3>drugs and going to the jungle and</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking hanging out with barefoot dudes</v>

3056
02:30:04.730 --> 02:30:09.730
<v Speaker 3>or giving you some toxic frog poison</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes away from that one.</v>

3057
02:30:11.600 --> 02:30:14.600
<v Speaker 3>I've done a lot of things and that was</v>
<v Speaker 3>definitely not one that you want to do</v>

3058
02:30:14.790 --> 02:30:16.360
<v Speaker 3>the Kambo poison.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

3059
02:30:16.380 --> 02:30:21.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean the psilocybin has been shown to</v>
<v Speaker 3>have neurogenesis help rebuild the brain</v>

3060
02:30:21.141 --> 02:30:24.080
<v Speaker 3>and neurons like what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3061
02:30:24.081 --> 02:30:25.970
<v Speaker 3>that's some crazy shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

3062
02:30:26.030 --> 02:30:29.510
<v Speaker 3>if you've experienced DMT,</v>
<v Speaker 3>either an Iowaska or smokable form,</v>

3063
02:30:29.810 --> 02:30:32.000
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot of times it feels like there's a</v>

3064
02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:35.360
<v Speaker 3>thousand little doctors like soldering</v>
<v Speaker 3>and fixing shit in your brain.</v>

3065
02:30:35.361 --> 02:30:37.070
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh well the end.</v>

3066
02:30:37.170 --> 02:30:39.740
<v Speaker 3>It was nice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The end of my trips always feel like,</v>

3067
02:30:39.980 --> 02:30:41.780
<v Speaker 3>like almost like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3068
02:30:41.790 --> 02:30:44.700
<v Speaker 3>if like if you went theoretically</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we've never done this,</v>

3069
02:30:44.840 --> 02:30:47.180
<v Speaker 3>could go to a massage parlor and get a</v>
<v Speaker 3>hand release.</v>

3070
02:30:47.410 --> 02:30:49.520
<v Speaker 3>Like they actually rubbed you down first</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they go,</v>

3071
02:30:49.521 --> 02:30:50.810
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now let's take care of the problem.</v>

3072
02:30:51.960 --> 02:30:55.190
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will dmt feels like you have this wild</v>

3073
02:30:55.191 --> 02:30:58.640
<v Speaker 3>exploratory trip.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then the end of it to me always</v>

3074
02:30:58.641 --> 02:31:00.410
<v Speaker 3>feels like they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

3075
02:31:00.470 --> 02:31:03.170
<v Speaker 3>well we got to do some maintenance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So just kick back and look at the pretty</v>

3076
02:31:03.171 --> 02:31:05.420
<v Speaker 3>lights were done showing you shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're just going to,</v>

3077
02:31:05.630 --> 02:31:08.690
<v Speaker 3>we're going to go deep there and just</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to correct some shit.</v>

3078
02:31:09.070 --> 02:31:10.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You hear the,</v>

3079
02:31:10.341 --> 02:31:12.350
<v Speaker 3>you hear in the Eco rose the IOWASCA</v>
<v Speaker 3>songs.</v>

3080
02:31:12.351 --> 02:31:14.650
<v Speaker 3>We'll often talk to Dr Ceto,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3081
02:31:14.720 --> 02:31:18.200
<v Speaker 3>Dr Ceto his little doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And so it's like,</v>

3082
02:31:18.410 --> 02:31:19.980
<v Speaker 3>it's a paradigm exists in</v>

3083
02:31:19.980 --> 02:31:22.320
<v Speaker 1>many cultures and you can feel it</v>
<v Speaker 1>independently,</v>

3084
02:31:22.530 --> 02:31:24.210
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I was feeling that before I</v>

3085
02:31:24.211 --> 02:31:25.021
<v Speaker 1>realized like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3086
02:31:25.021 --> 02:31:26.900
<v Speaker 1>Dr c dot a little doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3087
02:31:26.901 --> 02:31:28.650
<v Speaker 1>that's what they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they're talking about.</v>

3088
02:31:28.651 --> 02:31:30.350
<v Speaker 1>His little doctor come here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3089
02:31:30.400 --> 02:31:32.940
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what they're singing to the</v>

3090
02:31:32.941 --> 02:31:33.810
<v Speaker 1>plants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>

3091
02:31:33.930 --> 02:31:36.330
<v Speaker 1>these medicines will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's so many people that are dealing</v>

3092
02:31:36.331 --> 02:31:38.910
<v Speaker 1>with traumatic brain injuries these</v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

3093
02:31:39.030 --> 02:31:43.380
<v Speaker 1>How fascinating would it be if it found</v>
<v Speaker 1>out if they found out or it could prove</v>

3094
02:31:43.560 --> 02:31:47.820
<v Speaker 1>that siliciden could alleviate the</v>
<v Speaker 1>problems with traumatic brain injury by</v>

3095
02:31:47.821 --> 02:31:50.940
<v Speaker 1>regenerating tissue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but actually healing the brain?</v>

3096
02:31:51.340 --> 02:31:53.730
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's not where that is right now.</v>

3097
02:31:53.731 --> 02:31:55.350
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe it hasn't gotten to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>stage,</v>

3098
02:31:55.351 --> 02:31:59.350
<v Speaker 1>but between that stem cell treatments</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all sorts of different ways.</v>

3099
02:31:59.351 --> 02:32:04.351
<v Speaker 1>There's so many people like when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>lose the ability to see reality</v>

3100
02:32:04.441 --> 02:32:06.240
<v Speaker 1>correctly because your brain's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>functioning like either.</v>

3101
02:32:06.240 --> 02:32:08.970
<v Speaker 1>You're very Oregon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like having a television that just</v>

3102
02:32:08.971 --> 02:32:10.950
<v Speaker 1>doesn't get a good signal anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all fucked up.</v>

3103
02:32:11.190 --> 02:32:12.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be fixed,</v>

3104
02:32:12.420 --> 02:32:13.770
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can't fix it.</v>

3105
02:32:14.000 --> 02:32:16.770
<v Speaker 1>Like right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brain has a very limited ability to</v>

3106
02:32:16.771 --> 02:32:20.640
<v Speaker 1>fix itself and there are some strategies</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some different treatments that they</v>

3107
02:32:20.641 --> 02:32:25.641
<v Speaker 1>use to help people recover from</v>
<v Speaker 1>traumatic brain injuries and get to some</v>

3108
02:32:25.681 --> 02:32:28.470
<v Speaker 1>semblance of normalcy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But imagine if they got to a point where</v>

3109
02:32:28.471 --> 02:32:33.471
<v Speaker 1>they found out that this neurogenesis</v>
<v Speaker 1>capability that we've shown to exist in</v>

3110
02:32:33.670 --> 02:32:38.310
<v Speaker 1>silicide and can actually rebuild tissue</v>
<v Speaker 1>and heal brain and run proper studies</v>

3111
02:32:38.311 --> 02:32:40.620
<v Speaker 1>like you would with any other</v>
<v Speaker 1>supplementary thing out.</v>

3112
02:32:40.621 --> 02:32:41.191
<v Speaker 1>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

3113
02:32:41.191 --> 02:32:44.760
<v Speaker 1>well let's try a micro dose for over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>course of two months.</v>

3114
02:32:44.790 --> 02:32:47.430
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a sub detectable where you're not</v>

3115
02:32:47.480 --> 02:32:50.760
<v Speaker 1>like tripping your balls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just something like you would a</v>

3116
02:32:50.761 --> 02:32:51.690
<v Speaker 1>nutritional supplement.</v>

3117
02:32:51.690 --> 02:32:55.650
<v Speaker 1>Let's test that over against placebo for</v>
<v Speaker 1>two months and then measure the results</v>

3118
02:32:55.651 --> 02:32:56.484
<v Speaker 1>in the brain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3119
02:32:56.790 --> 02:33:01.680
<v Speaker 1>the suppression has just eliminated that</v>
<v Speaker 1>option for science to just explore these</v>

3120
02:33:01.681 --> 02:33:05.340
<v Speaker 1>hypotheses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what happens if you microdose dmt</v>

3121
02:33:05.610 --> 02:33:07.800
<v Speaker 1>in some form over the course of two</v>
<v Speaker 1>months?</v>

3122
02:33:07.801 --> 02:33:11.880
<v Speaker 1>Like how does that affect performance?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of people are doing that now.</v>

3123
02:33:11.881 --> 02:33:14.880
<v Speaker 1>They're microdosing on their own and</v>
<v Speaker 1>anecdotally reporting something.</v>

3124
02:33:14.881 --> 02:33:19.800
<v Speaker 1>But what we need is a placebo controlled</v>
<v Speaker 1>trial to say like unequivocably,</v>

3125
02:33:19.950 --> 02:33:21.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what this does.</v>

3126
02:33:21.330 --> 02:33:25.140
<v Speaker 1>But it's so hard to get that shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>approved and get the approval material</v>

3127
02:33:25.141 --> 02:33:28.530
<v Speaker 1>and get this done that it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's become challenging.</v>

3128
02:33:28.531 --> 02:33:31.590
<v Speaker 1>But when that lids off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be really,</v>

3129
02:33:31.591 --> 02:33:34.830
<v Speaker 1>really fucking cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree that this is the coolest time to</v>

3130
02:33:34.831 --> 02:33:37.830
<v Speaker 1>be alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is an an amazing,</v>

3131
02:33:37.860 --> 02:33:40.350
<v Speaker 1>fascinating time to be alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I wonder if they're going to look</v>

3132
02:33:40.351 --> 02:33:43.530
<v Speaker 1>back at us the way we look at champs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3133
02:33:43.650 --> 02:33:45.870
<v Speaker 1>lily's fucking dummies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They thought that was an awesome time to</v>

3134
02:33:45.900 --> 02:33:46.733
<v Speaker 1>be alive.</v>

3135
02:33:48.710 --> 02:33:53.250
<v Speaker 1>I wonder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if people always have that way</v>

3136
02:33:53.251 --> 02:33:57.750
<v Speaker 1>of looking at things where they just</v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciate what's around them and say,</v>

3137
02:33:57.751 --> 02:33:59.460
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is as good as it's ever been.</v>

3138
02:33:59.461 --> 02:34:02.940
<v Speaker 1>This is amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then one day they'll look back at us</v>

3139
02:34:02.941 --> 02:34:05.430
<v Speaker 1>and go with how ridiculous they couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>even read minds.</v>

3140
02:34:05.550 --> 02:34:08.880
<v Speaker 1>Imagine going through life not being</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to read minds like what a shitty</v>

3141
02:34:08.900 --> 02:34:11.220
<v Speaker 1>way to live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sort of how we look at people that can't</v>

3142
02:34:11.221 --> 02:34:13.590
<v Speaker 1>send emails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even have the Internet.</v>

3143
02:34:13.830 --> 02:34:17.590
<v Speaker 1>You had to go to a library and read a</v>
<v Speaker 1>book that was written hand.</v>

3144
02:34:17.830 --> 02:34:18.010
<v Speaker 1>Like</v>

3145
02:34:18.010 --> 02:34:20.800
<v Speaker 3>some guy wrote the a pen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had a feather,</v>

3146
02:34:20.950 --> 02:34:25.100
<v Speaker 3>a dip it in some coal that they mixed</v>
<v Speaker 3>with oil or whatever the fuck they use</v>

3147
02:34:25.101 --> 02:34:26.680
<v Speaker 3>to make ink.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3148
02:34:26.770 --> 02:34:31.180
<v Speaker 3>We're going to probably look back at</v>
<v Speaker 3>that someday and maybe even in our</v>

3149
02:34:31.181 --> 02:34:33.700
<v Speaker 3>lifetimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I bet there's also those people who</v>

3150
02:34:33.701 --> 02:34:36.070
<v Speaker 3>if you took them from the past like</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say,</v>

3151
02:34:36.310 --> 02:34:38.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you talked to him Musashi and you're</v>

3152
02:34:38.231 --> 02:34:40.510
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's an awesome future,</v>

3153
02:34:40.800 --> 02:34:43.360
<v Speaker 3>but you can't use your sword to cut</v>
<v Speaker 3>anybody.</v>

3154
02:34:43.361 --> 02:34:44.890
<v Speaker 3>He'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fuck,</v>

3155
02:34:45.130 --> 02:34:46.690
<v Speaker 3>I think I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3156
02:34:46.691 --> 02:34:49.420
<v Speaker 3>it's like we got all this cool shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We got computers and knowledge and you</v>

3157
02:34:49.421 --> 02:34:50.470
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these different things.</v>

3158
02:34:50.600 --> 02:34:52.270
<v Speaker 3>Travel the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have drones.</v>

3159
02:34:52.600 --> 02:34:56.410
<v Speaker 3>You don't even have to be involved and</v>
<v Speaker 3>just have to be like in another room</v>

3160
02:34:56.411 --> 02:34:58.330
<v Speaker 3>somewhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not going to be into that.</v>

3161
02:34:58.360 --> 02:35:03.100
<v Speaker 3>So much is just holding the steel in his</v>
<v Speaker 3>hand and just that's got to meet and so</v>

3162
02:35:03.101 --> 02:35:08.101
<v Speaker 3>in every age there's these parts of that</v>
<v Speaker 3>age that are irreplaceable.</v>

3163
02:35:08.410 --> 02:35:11.410
<v Speaker 3>I was in Vegas yesterday leaving the</v>
<v Speaker 3>airport early in the morning and you</v>

3164
02:35:11.411 --> 02:35:12.640
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're waiting in line at the security</v>

3165
02:35:12.641 --> 02:35:16.450
<v Speaker 3>thing to show your id and I looked up</v>
<v Speaker 3>and they had a screen that was giving</v>

3166
02:35:16.451 --> 02:35:21.220
<v Speaker 3>instructions and guidelines for using</v>
<v Speaker 3>drones and I was like,</v>

3167
02:35:21.250 --> 02:35:24.100
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're living in the future.</v>

3168
02:35:24.430 --> 02:35:25.111
<v Speaker 3>Like it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

3169
02:35:25.111 --> 02:35:27.160
<v Speaker 3>it almost.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was waiting for it to be a joke</v>

3170
02:35:27.161 --> 02:35:29.170
<v Speaker 3>because if you ever gone through the Las</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vegas airport,</v>

3171
02:35:29.290 --> 02:35:34.290
<v Speaker 3>they have these big screens up and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'll show these sort of humorous</v>

3172
02:35:35.510 --> 02:35:36.610
<v Speaker 3>character sketches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3173
02:35:36.620 --> 02:35:39.460
<v Speaker 3>Carrot top.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trying to carry all his props through</v>

3174
02:35:39.461 --> 02:35:41.680
<v Speaker 3>the security and showing what you can't</v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

3175
02:35:41.860 --> 02:35:45.400
<v Speaker 3>They have these heavy metal guys that</v>
<v Speaker 3>are taking off these giant spiked risk</v>

3176
02:35:45.401 --> 02:35:50.080
<v Speaker 3>bracelets and you know what you have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>like take off to go through security and</v>

3177
02:35:50.081 --> 02:35:52.690
<v Speaker 3>so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same screen where they show that</v>

3178
02:35:53.020 --> 02:35:56.500
<v Speaker 3>they showed this thing about drones and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3179
02:35:56.680 --> 02:35:58.810
<v Speaker 3>this seems like some starship troopers.</v>

3180
02:35:58.810 --> 02:36:01.630
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like it doesn't seem real,</v>

3181
02:36:01.840 --> 02:36:05.470
<v Speaker 3>but it was real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were talking about the Federal</v>

3182
02:36:05.470 --> 02:36:08.170
<v Speaker 3>Aviation Administration and the</v>
<v Speaker 3>guidelines and rules for using drones.</v>

3183
02:36:08.380 --> 02:36:12.250
<v Speaker 3>Don't let your drone get out of sight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't make your drone go over a certain</v>

3184
02:36:12.251 --> 02:36:15.820
<v Speaker 3>amount of feet in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't let your drone wandered near</v>

3185
02:36:15.821 --> 02:36:18.820
<v Speaker 3>airports.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't let your drone get involved in the</v>

3186
02:36:18.821 --> 02:36:21.400
<v Speaker 3>path of commercial flights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3187
02:36:21.401 --> 02:36:22.630
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is.</v>

3188
02:36:22.750 --> 02:36:25.240
<v Speaker 3>Please use your drone responsibly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

3189
02:36:25.241 --> 02:36:27.260
<v Speaker 3>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is bizarre.</v>

3190
02:36:27.340 --> 02:36:28.810
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like demolition man.</v>

3191
02:36:28.811 --> 02:36:33.190
<v Speaker 3>Weird future shit girl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see the drone that I almost dropped</v>

3192
02:36:33.191 --> 02:36:34.930
<v Speaker 3>on that skier?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>

3193
02:36:35.020 --> 02:36:38.760
<v Speaker 3>Jamie tried to find that there was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>drone that drops out of the sky and</v>

3194
02:36:38.770 --> 02:36:42.400
<v Speaker 3>almost completely obliterate ran out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>gas or something.</v>

3195
02:36:42.430 --> 02:36:44.680
<v Speaker 3>Ran Out of fucking signal or something</v>
<v Speaker 3>like.</v>

3196
02:36:44.681 --> 02:36:47.890
<v Speaker 3>And Paul's like right on the heels of</v>
<v Speaker 3>his skis.</v>

3197
02:36:47.980 --> 02:36:51.280
<v Speaker 3>It's wasn't the guy who was piloting it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3198
02:36:51.300 --> 02:36:52.330
<v Speaker 3>he was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

3199
02:36:52.331 --> 02:36:56.560
<v Speaker 3>it was an actual competition.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he's skiing ski racer.</v>

3200
02:36:56.920 --> 02:36:58.360
<v Speaker 3>Watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

3201
02:36:58.510 --> 02:37:02.260
<v Speaker 3>Oh Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hold on back that up again.</v>

3202
02:37:02.740 --> 02:37:04.080
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Slowmo.</v>

3203
02:37:06.520 --> 02:37:08.890
<v Speaker 3>Tom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's insane.</v>

3204
02:37:09.100 --> 02:37:11.890
<v Speaker 3>That want to fuck that dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucked him up for sure.</v>

3205
02:37:11.950 --> 02:37:15.860
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if that was like a person in</v>

3206
02:37:15.861 --> 02:37:20.120
<v Speaker 3>the audience that wanted to get like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>good video of it or whether that was the</v>

3207
02:37:20.150 --> 02:37:22.040
<v Speaker 3>real camera crew.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>

3208
02:37:22.610 --> 02:37:24.440
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a thing going on right now where</v>

3209
02:37:24.441 --> 02:37:29.030
<v Speaker 3>there's new technology that they haven't</v>
<v Speaker 3>had the ability to form the proper</v>

3210
02:37:29.031 --> 02:37:32.540
<v Speaker 3>regulations for yet and they're not</v>
<v Speaker 3>really aware of like what the issues are</v>

3211
02:37:32.810 --> 02:37:37.100
<v Speaker 3>like those Goddamn hoverboards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those things like you see people at the</v>

3212
02:37:37.101 --> 02:37:38.640
<v Speaker 3>airport,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at least they were for awhile.</v>

3213
02:37:38.690 --> 02:37:41.410
<v Speaker 3>I think they're trying to make that</v>
<v Speaker 3>illegal where they're at the airport and</v>

3214
02:37:41.411 --> 02:37:46.280
<v Speaker 3>they're wandering through the terminals</v>
<v Speaker 3>on these hoverboards just scooting along</v>

3215
02:37:46.281 --> 02:37:47.410
<v Speaker 3>on these.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These,</v>

3216
02:37:47.810 --> 02:37:52.160
<v Speaker 3>if you don't know what a hoverboard is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's essentially like a surf or it's</v>

3217
02:37:52.161 --> 02:37:55.490
<v Speaker 3>like a skateboard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but instead of going sideways,</v>

3218
02:37:55.520 --> 02:37:57.650
<v Speaker 3>like the way you skate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go forward.</v>

3219
02:37:57.950 --> 02:37:58.670
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3220
02:37:58.670 --> 02:38:03.110
<v Speaker 3>it's so it's perpendicular and there's</v>
<v Speaker 3>wheels on it and the wheels are like</v>

3221
02:38:03.470 --> 02:38:04.303
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3222
02:38:04.610 --> 02:38:05.870
<v Speaker 3>those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What are those things called?</v>

3223
02:38:05.871 --> 02:38:06.900
<v Speaker 3>The fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

3224
02:38:07.120 --> 02:38:08.630
<v Speaker 3>the segway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The segway.</v>

3225
02:38:08.631 --> 02:38:12.380
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a gyroscope and the gyroscopes sort</v>

3226
02:38:12.381 --> 02:38:14.390
<v Speaker 3>of balances you out and you roll around.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're fun.</v>

3227
02:38:14.391 --> 02:38:16.490
<v Speaker 3>My kids have them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I ride them around the house,</v>

3228
02:38:16.700 --> 02:38:19.310
<v Speaker 3>they're really fun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now they're starting to have</v>

3229
02:38:19.311 --> 02:38:20.780
<v Speaker 3>regulations like they're starting to</v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

3230
02:38:20.781 --> 02:38:22.580
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't ride these things on the</v>

3231
02:38:22.581 --> 02:38:23.420
<v Speaker 3>sidewalks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't.</v>

3232
02:38:23.421 --> 02:38:25.130
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>now we're making rules because those</v>

3233
02:38:25.131 --> 02:38:27.090
<v Speaker 3>rules didn't exist before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And people like,</v>

3234
02:38:27.170 --> 02:38:31.040
<v Speaker 3>remember when the Wiz Khalifa got</v>
<v Speaker 3>arrested at the airport,</v>

3235
02:38:31.250 --> 02:38:33.050
<v Speaker 3>he got arrested the airport because he</v>
<v Speaker 3>wouldn't get off of it.</v>

3236
02:38:33.140 --> 02:38:37.030
<v Speaker 3>Really Monitor to around probably</v>
<v Speaker 3>highest fuck tattoos on his face and he</v>

3237
02:38:37.040 --> 02:38:39.260
<v Speaker 3>doesn't give a fuck about a hoverboard</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>

3238
02:38:39.310 --> 02:38:42.800
<v Speaker 3>they arrested him for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't help street credit actually</v>

3239
02:38:42.950 --> 02:38:46.610
<v Speaker 3>when you get arrested for robbery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's a lot of arrests that</v>

3240
02:38:46.611 --> 02:38:48.260
<v Speaker 3>might help a rapper,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's maybe not.</v>

3241
02:38:48.530 --> 02:38:50.640
<v Speaker 3>Anytime a wrapper gets arrested,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's good because the thing is they</v>

3242
02:38:50.690 --> 02:38:52.960
<v Speaker 3>complain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These niggas don't know.</v>

3243
02:38:54.590 --> 02:38:57.350
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you should be allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do it,</v>

3244
02:38:57.351 --> 02:39:00.170
<v Speaker 3>but I do know when you do do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you know what you're doing,</v>

3245
02:39:00.171 --> 02:39:02.130
<v Speaker 3>like very precise with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3246
02:39:02.360 --> 02:39:05.690
<v Speaker 3>it's not an issue,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I think people have the idea,</v>

3247
02:39:05.720 --> 02:39:08.510
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the issue is it's automated and you can</v>

3248
02:39:08.511 --> 02:39:10.850
<v Speaker 3>potentially like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like uh,</v>

3249
02:39:10.880 --> 02:39:13.370
<v Speaker 3>my daughter I had a slower down and like</v>
<v Speaker 3>settle down,</v>

3250
02:39:13.371 --> 02:39:15.650
<v Speaker 3>settle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's fucking whizzing around in this</v>

3251
02:39:15.651 --> 02:39:18.980
<v Speaker 3>thing like really fast and she's wiped</v>
<v Speaker 3>out a couple of times.</v>

3252
02:39:18.990 --> 02:39:23.430
<v Speaker 3>Like she kinda crazy and she's wiped out</v>
<v Speaker 3>and hurt herself and I'm like just going</v>

3253
02:39:23.431 --> 02:39:27.890
<v Speaker 3>to just a little too fast and shark,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's getting to the edge of the ability</v>

3254
02:39:27.891 --> 02:39:30.500
<v Speaker 3>to control the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if someone was doing that in an</v>

3255
02:39:30.501 --> 02:39:32.960
<v Speaker 3>airport,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it could be a real problem between those</v>

3256
02:39:32.961 --> 02:39:33.890
<v Speaker 3>and drones.</v>

3257
02:39:34.280 --> 02:39:38.270
<v Speaker 3>Like these emerging technologies that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't necessarily have regulations for</v>

3258
02:39:38.271 --> 02:39:40.610
<v Speaker 3>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think there's so many people that</v>

3259
02:39:40.611 --> 02:39:43.320
<v Speaker 3>are so fragile and they get so scared,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3260
02:39:43.380 --> 02:39:46.780
<v Speaker 3>like they can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they haven't kept up with their body so</v>

3261
02:39:46.790 --> 02:39:51.260
<v Speaker 3>they can't get out of the way if some</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit happened or like if they did get</v>

3262
02:39:51.380 --> 02:39:53.690
<v Speaker 3>hit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're going to break for sure.</v>

3263
02:39:53.691 --> 02:39:55.280
<v Speaker 3>Like in Santa Monica,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that happens all the time.</v>

3264
02:39:55.281 --> 02:39:58.390
<v Speaker 3>We'll be riding our bikes around and</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll pass them old people and they'll</v>

3265
02:39:58.400 --> 02:40:00.620
<v Speaker 3>just curse us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're not even close.</v>

3266
02:40:00.770 --> 02:40:01.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like on the bikes,</v>

3267
02:40:01.641 --> 02:40:03.450
<v Speaker 3>we miss them by six feet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3268
02:40:03.510 --> 02:40:07.790
<v Speaker 3>Like fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because they know they're just in this</v>

3269
02:40:07.791 --> 02:40:11.870
<v Speaker 3>kind of like fragile state and so they</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of panic when there's something on</v>

3270
02:40:11.871 --> 02:40:14.010
<v Speaker 3>wheels rolling by.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't really</v>

3271
02:40:14.340 --> 02:40:17.920
<v Speaker 1>understand them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crackers there are made out of crackers.</v>

3272
02:40:19.190 --> 02:40:20.940
<v Speaker 1>They fall down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a wrap.</v>

3273
02:40:20.970 --> 02:40:22.170
<v Speaker 1>It's over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything over.</v>

3274
02:40:22.610 --> 02:40:25.920
<v Speaker 1>Imagine a wiping out on an old lady with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bike.</v>

3275
02:40:26.220 --> 02:40:29.910
<v Speaker 1>If you're whipping along on a mountain</v>
<v Speaker 1>bike and you collided with an 80 year</v>

3276
02:40:29.911 --> 02:40:32.730
<v Speaker 1>old lady,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would just shatter her whole body.</v>

3277
02:40:32.731 --> 02:40:34.710
<v Speaker 1>Everything would just snap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crackle.</v>

3278
02:40:35.310 --> 02:40:37.620
<v Speaker 1>They can't fall down like you can't fall</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

3279
02:40:37.650 --> 02:40:40.530
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body gets to a place where you</v>

3280
02:40:40.531 --> 02:40:43.590
<v Speaker 1>cannot fall down if you fall down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything breaks.</v>

3281
02:40:44.490 --> 02:40:47.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not a future that I'm hoping for.</v>

3282
02:40:47.130 --> 02:40:49.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean fuck.</v>

3283
02:40:49.740 --> 02:40:52.260
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how much that can be mitigated</v>
<v Speaker 1>by strength training.</v>

3284
02:40:52.800 --> 02:40:54.930
<v Speaker 1>A lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Training and mineralization,</v>

3285
02:40:54.931 --> 02:40:56.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping their bone density up,</v>

3286
02:40:56.850 --> 02:40:59.870
<v Speaker 1>making sure that you have the spare</v>
<v Speaker 1>parts to replace the ones that you're</v>

3287
02:40:59.880 --> 02:41:00.631
<v Speaker 1>losing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3288
02:41:00.631 --> 02:41:02.250
<v Speaker 1>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3289
02:41:02.251 --> 02:41:03.120
<v Speaker 1>a big part of it.</v>

3290
02:41:03.120 --> 02:41:06.690
<v Speaker 1>Getting the muscles on the frame and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then supporting the bones and making</v>

3291
02:41:06.691 --> 02:41:10.170
<v Speaker 1>sure that your body is sturdy enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you see the other way if you see</v>

3292
02:41:10.171 --> 02:41:14.040
<v Speaker 1>these people is just sturdy is shit and</v>
<v Speaker 1>all different cultures.</v>

3293
02:41:14.041 --> 02:41:16.170
<v Speaker 1>Cultures that don't have medicines and</v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceuticals.</v>

3294
02:41:16.171 --> 02:41:20.550
<v Speaker 1>Like even in the jungle again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see somebody 75 with a machete,</v>

3295
02:41:20.551 --> 02:41:24.210
<v Speaker 1>just kicking ass macho,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big cigarette coming out of his mouth.</v>

3296
02:41:24.211 --> 02:41:27.510
<v Speaker 1>Just ha ha.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then drinks beers at the end of the</v>

3297
02:41:27.510 --> 02:41:27.781
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3298
02:41:27.781 --> 02:41:30.660
<v Speaker 1>like if you stay that vigorous and</v>
<v Speaker 1>active,</v>

3299
02:41:30.661 --> 02:41:31.900
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3300
02:41:32.070 --> 02:41:35.700
<v Speaker 1>and eating very natural foods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously they don't have another choice</v>

3301
02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:39.990
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of those cases you can see the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other side and then you can see this</v>

3302
02:41:39.991 --> 02:41:44.370
<v Speaker 1>kind of this other amalgamation which is</v>
<v Speaker 1>gary where you got cracker bones.</v>

3303
02:41:44.400 --> 02:41:45.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's more,</v>

3304
02:41:45.330 --> 02:41:48.390
<v Speaker 1>that's another benefit of being able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do the work.</v>

3305
02:41:48.420 --> 02:41:52.500
<v Speaker 1>Being able to force yourself to do some</v>
<v Speaker 1>things you don't want to do as far as</v>

3306
02:41:52.501 --> 02:41:55.470
<v Speaker 1>that like exercise and pushing yourself.</v>

3307
02:41:55.980 --> 02:42:00.390
<v Speaker 1>The benefits of that are you have a body</v>
<v Speaker 1>that works way better for way longer,</v>

3308
02:42:00.570 --> 02:42:03.210
<v Speaker 1>and if you don't do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get deterioration and you get</v>

3309
02:42:03.211 --> 02:42:06.260
<v Speaker 1>atrophy and then you become frail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You become that old person.</v>

3310
02:42:06.261 --> 02:42:08.610
<v Speaker 1>It's screaming at you because you're on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bike 10 feet away from them.</v>

3311
02:42:09.700 --> 02:42:12.170
<v Speaker 1>You can kill me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cracker bones.</v>

3312
02:42:13.310 --> 02:42:14.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

3313
02:42:14.490 --> 02:42:15.360
<v Speaker 1>It's a bummer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3314
02:42:15.870 --> 02:42:17.010
<v Speaker 1>It's a bummer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>

3315
02:42:17.011 --> 02:42:19.080
<v Speaker 1>that's another inevitable bummer about</v>
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

3316
02:42:19.081 --> 02:42:22.980
<v Speaker 1>but it's also isn't that part of what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>beautiful about this is that you can't</v>

3317
02:42:22.981 --> 02:42:25.110
<v Speaker 1>be that girl with the picks and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>instagram forever,</v>

3318
02:42:25.111 --> 02:42:29.850
<v Speaker 1>like why the butt pics are so exciting</v>
<v Speaker 1>is because that but only exists for</v>

3319
02:42:29.851 --> 02:42:34.851
<v Speaker 1>about 20 years or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll start falling blossoms perfectly</v>

3320
02:42:35.161 --> 02:42:37.140
<v Speaker 1>right before it falls off into nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3321
02:42:37.141 --> 02:42:39.420
<v Speaker 1>That was the great symbol for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Samurai was.</v>

3322
02:42:39.421 --> 02:42:42.780
<v Speaker 1>That's why they appreciated it because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it flowers and beauty and then falls.</v>

3323
02:42:42.780 --> 02:42:47.070
<v Speaker 1>That's life time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Time will rip US clutching and grabbing</v>

3324
02:42:47.071 --> 02:42:50.190
<v Speaker 1>from every attachment that we have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It always wins.</v>

3325
02:42:50.460 --> 02:42:54.450
<v Speaker 1>It's like someone in Jujitsu with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate squeeze that never gets tired</v>

3326
02:42:54.451 --> 02:42:58.050
<v Speaker 1>like we're going to have to tap out at</v>
<v Speaker 1>some point of everything that we love.</v>

3327
02:42:58.051 --> 02:43:00.740
<v Speaker 1>Everything that we like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so might as well just accept that like</v>

3328
02:43:00.750 --> 02:43:02.820
<v Speaker 1>it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enjoy it while it's here and in a</v>

3329
02:43:02.821 --> 02:43:04.980
<v Speaker 1>fractal sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you can live forever,</v>

3330
02:43:04.981 --> 02:43:06.910
<v Speaker 1>the fucking planet will be here forever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3331
02:43:07.410 --> 02:43:11.100
<v Speaker 1>The Sun will burn out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sun is going to run out of energy</v>

3332
02:43:11.110 --> 02:43:15.370
<v Speaker 1>and it's going to eventually supernova.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good luck.</v>

3333
02:43:16.300 --> 02:43:18.790
<v Speaker 1>You can't live forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no forever.</v>

3334
02:43:18.791 --> 02:43:21.040
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Time always wins.</v>

3335
02:43:21.100 --> 02:43:24.840
<v Speaker 1>That time is a motherfucker know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is such a motherfucker.</v>

3336
02:43:24.850 --> 02:43:29.750
<v Speaker 1>I wrote this piece for Maxim magazine</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how the human body's like sand</v>

3337
02:43:29.751 --> 02:43:32.320
<v Speaker 1>castle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the cool things about a</v>

3338
02:43:32.321 --> 02:43:35.560
<v Speaker 1>sand castle as you're building it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the beautiful things about,</v>

3339
02:43:35.561 --> 02:43:36.940
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not gonna last.</v>

3340
02:43:37.330 --> 02:43:39.970
<v Speaker 1>If you made a sand castle out of cement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody would be impressed.</v>

3341
02:43:40.240 --> 02:43:43.030
<v Speaker 1>So something about a sandcastle where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3342
02:43:43.031 --> 02:43:46.930
<v Speaker 1>you've put all this work into it with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the understanding that this is entirely</v>

3343
02:43:46.931 --> 02:43:50.560
<v Speaker 1>temporary and that's sort of the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing with a human body and I was</v>

3344
02:43:50.561 --> 02:43:54.580
<v Speaker 1>comparing old Arnold Schwartzenegger</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the seventies to the Arnold</v>

3345
02:43:54.580 --> 02:43:57.090
<v Speaker 1>Schwartzenegger now with the dad bod</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you see them now and his little</v>

3346
02:43:57.100 --> 02:43:59.200
<v Speaker 1>skivvies on the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like Whoa,</v>

3347
02:43:59.800 --> 02:44:02.710
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the tide is started to come in,</v>

3348
02:44:02.830 --> 02:44:05.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that ocean spray is washing away the</v>

3349
02:44:05.501 --> 02:44:09.580
<v Speaker 1>towers and washing away everything until</v>
<v Speaker 1>eventually there's only the memory and</v>

3350
02:44:09.581 --> 02:44:11.500
<v Speaker 1>the pictures of that sand castle as it</v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

3351
02:44:11.650 --> 02:44:14.890
<v Speaker 1>And that is fucking beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not something to be lamented,</v>

3352
02:44:14.900 --> 02:44:17.800
<v Speaker 1>like appreciate that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's temporary.</v>

3353
02:44:17.801 --> 02:44:19.420
<v Speaker 1>So we fucking love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

3354
02:44:19.480 --> 02:44:21.940
<v Speaker 1>You know like that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a part of the thing.</v>

3355
02:44:22.210 --> 02:44:24.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the more fascinating aspects</v>

3356
02:44:24.131 --> 02:44:27.490
<v Speaker 1>about at all is that it is temporary and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that if it wasn't,</v>

3357
02:44:27.491 --> 02:44:29.530
<v Speaker 1>if everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the way I described it in the</v>

3358
02:44:29.531 --> 02:44:32.030
<v Speaker 1>article was like if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it.</v>

3359
02:44:32.080 --> 02:44:34.840
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be like as boring as playing a</v>

3360
02:44:34.841 --> 02:44:38.770
<v Speaker 1>video game on God mode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never play a quake on God mode.</v>

3361
02:44:39.580 --> 02:44:41.530
<v Speaker 1>You can type quake used to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could,</v>

3362
02:44:41.531 --> 02:44:43.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go to hit the [inaudible] key and go</v>

3363
02:44:43.841 --> 02:44:46.360
<v Speaker 1>into the command prompt and you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

3364
02:44:46.570 --> 02:44:50.380
<v Speaker 1>you could type in God and you would play</v>
<v Speaker 1>on God mode.</v>

3365
02:44:50.440 --> 02:44:53.530
<v Speaker 1>In God mode is you were in vulnerable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your life would last forever.</v>

3366
02:44:53.680 --> 02:44:56.230
<v Speaker 1>It all the weapons you wanted and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't get hurt.</v>

3367
02:44:56.320 --> 02:45:00.700
<v Speaker 1>She just run around shooting things and</v>
<v Speaker 1>as boring as fuck and no consequences</v>

3368
02:45:00.820 --> 02:45:04.840
<v Speaker 1>and not worrying at all about your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>mortality.</v>

3369
02:45:05.320 --> 02:45:06.790
<v Speaker 1>That would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't be fun.</v>

3370
02:45:06.791 --> 02:45:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the fun things about doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>wild shit is you know you're going to</v>

3371
02:45:09.781 --> 02:45:11.350
<v Speaker 1>have to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3372
02:45:11.500 --> 02:45:13.930
<v Speaker 1>one of the fun things about sex is you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what's going to end.</v>

3373
02:45:14.020 --> 02:45:15.850
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to get when you get it.</v>

3374
02:45:15.851 --> 02:45:18.670
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't leave her fucking and then it's</v>

3375
02:45:18.671 --> 02:45:19.600
<v Speaker 1>over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then your tie.</v>

3376
02:45:19.630 --> 02:45:21.550
<v Speaker 1>One of the fun things about dragon is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>god damn,</v>

3377
02:45:21.551 --> 02:45:23.990
<v Speaker 1>we're going to pay for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

3378
02:45:24.150 --> 02:45:27.280
<v Speaker 1>it's part of the whole thing is it is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Yin and Yang.</v>

3379
02:45:27.281 --> 02:45:28.570
<v Speaker 1>It is the struggle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>

3380
02:45:29.080 --> 02:45:30.490
<v Speaker 1>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3381
02:45:30.580 --> 02:45:34.660
<v Speaker 1>the consequences and it's the reward and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all together.</v>

3382
02:45:34.830 --> 02:45:37.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the coolest fucking video game that</v>

3383
02:45:37.481 --> 02:45:38.710
<v Speaker 1>we all made together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3384
02:45:38.711 --> 02:45:40.420
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really what it is.</v>

3385
02:45:40.450 --> 02:45:42.400
<v Speaker 1>And we were born into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>born into it,</v>

3386
02:45:42.490 --> 02:45:44.530
<v Speaker 1>and then we just get to decide how we</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to play,</v>

3387
02:45:44.590 --> 02:45:46.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decide if we want to level up,</v>

3388
02:45:46.241 --> 02:45:49.180
<v Speaker 1>decide if we want to retreat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can ultimately decide if we want to</v>

3389
02:45:49.181 --> 02:45:52.210
<v Speaker 1>hit the reset button,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if we hit that reset button,</v>

3390
02:45:52.480 --> 02:45:54.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and end this game right now,</v>

3391
02:45:54.640 --> 02:45:56.600
<v Speaker 1>we'll never get to play this turn again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3392
02:45:56.601 --> 02:45:58.390
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we get to be this person at this</v>

3393
02:45:58.391 --> 02:46:00.730
<v Speaker 1>time on this planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't say never,</v>

3394
02:46:00.731 --> 02:46:02.980
<v Speaker 1>but holds likely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most likely.</v>

3395
02:46:02.981 --> 02:46:05.470
<v Speaker 1>You never get to do a Redo of this exact</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

3396
02:46:05.471 --> 02:46:08.560
<v Speaker 1>Maybe something similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so what are you missing out on?</v>

3397
02:46:08.561 --> 02:46:10.580
<v Speaker 1>You're missing out on a unique</v>

3398
02:46:10.610 --> 02:46:15.140
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to experience something</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally unique in that sense.</v>

3399
02:46:15.141 --> 02:46:17.690
<v Speaker 2>And so it's a real shame to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think,</v>

3400
02:46:18.020 --> 02:46:20.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think taking some of the pressure off</v>

3401
02:46:20.330 --> 02:46:21.910
<v Speaker 2>that situation like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh okay,</v>

3402
02:46:21.920 --> 02:46:25.430
<v Speaker 2>some people may want to hit that reset</v>
<v Speaker 2>button because shit sucks and that's</v>

3403
02:46:25.431 --> 02:46:28.730
<v Speaker 2>lamentable and it's an unfortunate</v>
<v Speaker 2>situation because of those things that I</v>

3404
02:46:28.731 --> 02:46:32.030
<v Speaker 2>mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in my worldview that is just hitting</v>

3405
02:46:32.031 --> 02:46:34.520
<v Speaker 2>the reset button on the game and you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>a chance to play,</v>

3406
02:46:34.940 --> 02:46:36.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some other time</v>

3407
02:46:36.690 --> 02:46:40.320
<v Speaker 3>or you come back as well as poisonous</v>
<v Speaker 3>frog is in Topanga Canyon and fuck</v>

3408
02:46:40.321 --> 02:46:43.320
<v Speaker 3>people up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That would be a motherfucker.</v>

3409
02:46:43.350 --> 02:46:43.681
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3410
02:46:43.681 --> 02:46:47.400
<v Speaker 3>with this idea that we always that</v>
<v Speaker 3>reincarnation,</v>

3411
02:46:47.430 --> 02:46:49.980
<v Speaker 3>you always come back as a person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine if not,</v>

3412
02:46:50.340 --> 02:46:52.920
<v Speaker 3>imagine if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you become a person,</v>

3413
02:46:52.921 --> 02:46:55.530
<v Speaker 3>a person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is that top of the food chain ideally.</v>

3414
02:46:55.531 --> 02:46:56.364
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

3415
02:46:56.610 --> 02:46:59.220
<v Speaker 3>So when you come back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you come back as an Amoeba</v>

3416
02:47:00.790 --> 02:47:02.610
<v Speaker 3>and you've got to go through the whole</v>
<v Speaker 3>process again.</v>

3417
02:47:02.790 --> 02:47:06.030
<v Speaker 3>You had dies an Amoeba,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you come back as a multicell organism,</v>

3418
02:47:06.031 --> 02:47:07.680
<v Speaker 3>you die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you come back as a slug,</v>

3419
02:47:07.710 --> 02:47:11.490
<v Speaker 3>death come back as a frog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Death come back as a bird death.</v>

3420
02:47:11.820 --> 02:47:16.050
<v Speaker 3>You're a dog death,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a chicken death death,</v>

3421
02:47:16.290 --> 02:47:17.290
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't know,</v>

3422
02:47:17.370 --> 02:47:21.330
<v Speaker 3>time doesn't give a fuck no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then there's multiple dimensions and</v>

3423
02:47:21.331 --> 02:47:24.480
<v Speaker 3>infinite universes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you just keep coming back as new</v>

3424
02:47:24.481 --> 02:47:26.670
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>
<v Speaker 3>new things on other planets,</v>

3425
02:47:26.671 --> 02:47:30.480
<v Speaker 3>new biological creatures that we haven't</v>
<v Speaker 3>even begun to discover,</v>

3426
02:47:30.720 --> 02:47:33.330
<v Speaker 3>like the idea that if you live and die,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you only live in dying.</v>

3427
02:47:33.330 --> 02:47:35.490
<v Speaker 3>This one patch of dirt and that your</v>
<v Speaker 3>soul,</v>

3428
02:47:35.491 --> 02:47:37.230
<v Speaker 3>if that's a real thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your consciousness,</v>

3429
02:47:37.231 --> 02:47:40.680
<v Speaker 3>your entity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your essence only transcends this body</v>

3430
02:47:40.681 --> 02:47:42.720
<v Speaker 3>and enters into another one like it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3431
02:47:42.721 --> 02:47:47.721
<v Speaker 3>in past life who queen or lived in new</v>
<v Speaker 3>people were fucking presidents or kings</v>

3432
02:47:48.120 --> 02:47:51.450
<v Speaker 3>like every motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a president or a king in the</v>

3433
02:47:51.510 --> 02:47:54.660
<v Speaker 3>past,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a homeless person sucking dick for</v>

3434
02:47:54.661 --> 02:47:58.110
<v Speaker 3>homemade wine and all the fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the Gypsies are telling you that</v>

3435
02:47:58.111 --> 02:47:58.680
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's like,</v>

3436
02:47:58.680 --> 02:48:01.530
<v Speaker 3>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see you at a great general like,</v>

3437
02:48:01.531 --> 02:48:02.580
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker,</v>
<v Speaker 3>come on,</v>

3438
02:48:02.581 --> 02:48:04.440
<v Speaker 3>come on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How about I was a loser?</v>

3439
02:48:04.920 --> 02:48:08.280
<v Speaker 3>I would like to elucidate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Or Julius Caesar,</v>

3440
02:48:08.480 --> 02:48:11.550
<v Speaker 3>the 7,000 Julius Caesar's from fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>fortunate.</v>

3441
02:48:11.670 --> 02:48:12.510
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see you.</v>

3442
02:48:12.511 --> 02:48:16.110
<v Speaker 3>It was great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Caesar leading the Roman as well.</v>

3443
02:48:16.140 --> 02:48:19.020
<v Speaker 3>People love this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Love that whole nostalgia.</v>

3444
02:48:19.200 --> 02:48:20.370
<v Speaker 3>I was listening to this one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3445
02:48:20.490 --> 02:48:22.290
<v Speaker 3>African American dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was talking about.</v>

3446
02:48:22.320 --> 02:48:24.610
<v Speaker 3>He was talking about the history of</v>
<v Speaker 3>black people.</v>

3447
02:48:24.611 --> 02:48:26.760
<v Speaker 3>It's like we were kings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what he said.</v>

3448
02:48:26.790 --> 02:48:27.181
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3449
02:48:27.181 --> 02:48:29.130
<v Speaker 3>somebody needs to talk to you because</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't.</v>

3450
02:48:29.131 --> 02:48:31.500
<v Speaker 3>Everybody can't be kings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do Kings work.</v>

3451
02:48:31.710 --> 02:48:33.950
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kings are assholes and if you were a</v>

3452
02:48:33.951 --> 02:48:36.360
<v Speaker 3>king back then most likely fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>killed.</v>

3453
02:48:36.361 --> 02:48:38.850
<v Speaker 3>A bunch of people were enslaving a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 3>of motherfuckers.</v>

3454
02:48:38.920 --> 02:48:39.890
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This idea,</v>

3455
02:48:39.930 --> 02:48:42.320
<v Speaker 3>we worked things like how many,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many of you were kings?</v>

3456
02:48:42.330 --> 02:48:43.500
<v Speaker 3>Did you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll get along.</v>

3457
02:48:43.530 --> 02:48:46.200
<v Speaker 3>Did y'all have separate kingdoms?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you all live in a community of</v>

3458
02:48:46.201 --> 02:48:48.360
<v Speaker 3>kingdoms?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what the fuck he talking about</v>

3459
02:48:49.080 --> 02:48:51.990
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ in the past?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3460
02:48:52.120 --> 02:48:53.540
<v Speaker 3>we would love that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'd love to.</v>

3461
02:48:53.820 --> 02:48:55.500
<v Speaker 3>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm really curious about that.</v>

3462
02:48:55.501 --> 02:48:58.440
<v Speaker 3>Like this longing for nostalgia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what is that?</v>

3463
02:48:58.620 --> 02:49:00.990
<v Speaker 3>What people want to look to the past?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

3464
02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:06.000
<v Speaker 3>I dated this girl a long time ago and</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was brutal in the fact that she</v>

3465
02:49:06.450 --> 02:49:08.040
<v Speaker 3>always distorted</v>

3466
02:49:08.040 --> 02:49:11.970
<v Speaker 1>the past and made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds so amazing and so incredible.</v>

3467
02:49:11.971 --> 02:49:13.010
<v Speaker 1>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3468
02:49:13.020 --> 02:49:16.710
<v Speaker 1>like what you grew up in a broken home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your parents were abusive,</v>

3469
02:49:16.711 --> 02:49:18.640
<v Speaker 1>alcoholic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so was like,</v>

3470
02:49:18.820 --> 02:49:20.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we're together,</v>

3471
02:49:20.041 --> 02:49:23.570
<v Speaker 1>the love was amazing and they were</v>
<v Speaker 1>always together and they always know</v>

3472
02:49:23.580 --> 02:49:24.540
<v Speaker 1>they weren't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they fought,</v>

3473
02:49:24.541 --> 02:49:27.090
<v Speaker 1>they threw glasses at each other like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>

3474
02:49:27.240 --> 02:49:32.240
<v Speaker 1>Will you look at the life as what it</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually is in gain those possible</v>

3475
02:49:33.811 --> 02:49:38.811
<v Speaker 1>lessons from the actual truth of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>life instead of this romantic fucking</v>

3476
02:49:39.451 --> 02:49:43.590
<v Speaker 1>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this strange reese witherspoon movie of</v>

3477
02:49:43.591 --> 02:49:45.660
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like somehow,</v>

3478
02:49:45.661 --> 02:49:48.900
<v Speaker 1>like people feel like they need that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who they are.</v>

3479
02:49:48.901 --> 02:49:52.890
<v Speaker 1>It's built into like their own pride in</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves having this thing.</v>

3480
02:49:52.891 --> 02:49:54.930
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just strip all that shit away.</v>

3481
02:49:54.931 --> 02:49:56.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that the ego that wants all of</v>

3482
02:49:56.960 --> 02:49:59.130
<v Speaker 1>these things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once that passed and once this,</v>

3483
02:49:59.490 --> 02:50:03.480
<v Speaker 1>you got to just strip that little tyrant</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just like take all that armor off,</v>

3484
02:50:03.481 --> 02:50:07.050
<v Speaker 1>take all the bullshit off and let it</v>
<v Speaker 1>stand naked in the light of truth.</v>

3485
02:50:07.050 --> 02:50:09.600
<v Speaker 1>Just naked as shit out there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3486
02:50:09.900 --> 02:50:11.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get real,</v>

3487
02:50:11.420 --> 02:50:13.950
<v Speaker 1>get real with the elements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it has something to do with</v>

3488
02:50:13.951 --> 02:50:15.030
<v Speaker 1>movies too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3489
02:50:15.060 --> 02:50:18.030
<v Speaker 1>I think it has something to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>literature and it's something to do with</v>

3490
02:50:18.031 --> 02:50:21.470
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our creation of a narrative like our</v>

3491
02:50:21.480 --> 02:50:26.280
<v Speaker 1>creation of these uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these lives that we read about and</v>

3492
02:50:26.281 --> 02:50:30.990
<v Speaker 1>watching films and we sort of apply them</v>
<v Speaker 1>to our database of what's possible.</v>

3493
02:50:31.620 --> 02:50:32.520
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3494
02:50:32.550 --> 02:50:37.500
<v Speaker 1>you sort of like look back on some movie</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you saw that was wonderful and it</v>

3495
02:50:37.501 --> 02:50:38.850
<v Speaker 1>was amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3496
02:50:38.851 --> 02:50:43.380
<v Speaker 1>some really silly movie and you apply</v>
<v Speaker 1>that to your own past and you sort of</v>

3497
02:50:43.381 --> 02:50:47.040
<v Speaker 1>like trying to twist things around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you're describing them</v>

3498
02:50:47.041 --> 02:50:49.170
<v Speaker 1>to other people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want people to think you had the</v>

3499
02:50:49.171 --> 02:50:53.460
<v Speaker 1>most amazing life but it never works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like name dropping,</v>

3500
02:50:53.940 --> 02:50:56.130
<v Speaker 1>like name dropping has the opposite</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect,</v>

3501
02:50:56.480 --> 02:51:00.150
<v Speaker 1>like it doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the idea that you are going to</v>

3502
02:51:00.151 --> 02:51:05.151
<v Speaker 1>somehow or another make people like you</v>
<v Speaker 1>more because you know,</v>

3503
02:51:05.370 --> 02:51:08.010
<v Speaker 1>you know Harry Belafonte or someone.</v>

3504
02:51:08.190 --> 02:51:11.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I said Harold Bell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the fuck that came from?</v>

3505
02:51:11.820 --> 02:51:14.550
<v Speaker 1>Leonardo Dicaprio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really good friends with Leo.</v>

3506
02:51:14.830 --> 02:51:16.590
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we go to bars that you immediately think</v>

3507
02:51:16.591 --> 02:51:19.050
<v Speaker 1>that guy's a douche bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People assume that this,</v>

3508
02:51:19.230 --> 02:51:23.010
<v Speaker 1>the machinations behind what they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying are completely transparent,</v>

3509
02:51:23.011 --> 02:51:26.280
<v Speaker 1>but they're not like people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people are blind to it and ignorant</v>

3510
02:51:26.281 --> 02:51:28.140
<v Speaker 1>and that's when name dropping work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like oh my God,</v>

3511
02:51:28.141 --> 02:51:28.974
<v Speaker 1>you're know Leo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blah Blah,</v>

3512
02:51:29.130 --> 02:51:33.030
<v Speaker 1>and they're just operating on that short</v>
<v Speaker 1>hamster wheel that's running full speed</v>

3513
02:51:33.031 --> 02:51:36.870
<v Speaker 1>and they can't figure out that he's has</v>
<v Speaker 1>some other compulsion that's causing</v>

3514
02:51:36.871 --> 02:51:39.930
<v Speaker 1>them to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you meet somebody who has a</v>

3515
02:51:39.931 --> 02:51:41.190
<v Speaker 1>little bit of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3516
02:51:41.191 --> 02:51:43.500
<v Speaker 1>wherewithal and it's just gross.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

3517
02:51:43.520 --> 02:51:44.880
<v Speaker 1>Ugh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you doing?</v>

3518
02:51:44.881 --> 02:51:49.440
<v Speaker 1>I see what you're trying to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That I see these hidden motivations and</v>

3519
02:51:49.470 --> 02:51:52.380
<v Speaker 1>I think that's kind of what we're seeing</v>
<v Speaker 1>in politics.</v>

3520
02:51:52.380 --> 02:51:54.300
<v Speaker 1>We're seeing across the board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

3521
02:51:54.720 --> 02:51:57.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so many different little gimmicks</v>

3522
02:51:57.001 --> 02:52:01.020
<v Speaker 1>that people play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like even them saying when I'm president</v>

3523
02:52:01.021 --> 02:52:03.090
<v Speaker 1>of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't fucking believe that when</v>

3524
02:52:03.091 --> 02:52:05.420
<v Speaker 1>fucking Jeb Bush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when present,</v>

3525
02:52:05.421 --> 02:52:07.810
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can tell you're like our</v>

3526
02:52:07.811 --> 02:52:11.830
<v Speaker 1>bullshit belief detectors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know that when he's saying he doesn't</v>

3527
02:52:11.831 --> 02:52:13.840
<v Speaker 1>believe it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know who does believe it when</v>

3528
02:52:13.841 --> 02:52:17.970
<v Speaker 1>conor mcgregor says when they clash them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not gonna fucking head off he</v>

3529
02:52:17.980 --> 02:52:21.580
<v Speaker 1>fuck it believes it was Scottish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just fucked up the Irish accent.</v>

3530
02:52:22.400 --> 02:52:24.040
<v Speaker 1>Irish accents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tough do.</v>

3531
02:52:25.780 --> 02:52:26.613
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He definitely.</v>

3532
02:52:26.620 --> 02:52:27.453
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he in that,</v>

3533
02:52:27.570 --> 02:52:30.520
<v Speaker 1>that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that limited world of interacting with</v>

3534
02:52:30.521 --> 02:52:32.920
<v Speaker 1>bones and flesh and technique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3535
02:52:32.921 --> 02:52:34.960
<v Speaker 1>He,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he understands it to the point where he</v>

3536
02:52:34.961 --> 02:52:38.500
<v Speaker 1>really believes it and says it and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think although probably believed it too</v>

3537
02:52:38.501 --> 02:52:40.540
<v Speaker 1>and some sort of fucked up way believed</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

3538
02:52:40.600 --> 02:52:41.351
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3539
02:52:41.351 --> 02:52:43.780
<v Speaker 1>I think that's one of the things I think</v>
<v Speaker 1>when anybody's fighting,</v>

3540
02:52:44.020 --> 02:52:46.000
<v Speaker 1>it's not only a test of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>physicality,</v>

3541
02:52:46.001 --> 02:52:49.840
<v Speaker 1>it's like a test of their belief and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that squaring off and all of the</v>

3542
02:52:50.080 --> 02:52:51.280
<v Speaker 1>stare downs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3543
02:52:51.550 --> 02:52:53.230
<v Speaker 1>how much do you believe you're going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>beat me?</v>

3544
02:52:53.440 --> 02:52:54.730
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most people probably.</v>

3545
02:52:54.731 --> 02:52:56.590
<v Speaker 1>Great champions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in that 98.</v>

3546
02:52:56.591 --> 02:52:59.050
<v Speaker 1>They're pretty confident.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Connor just shows up straight.</v>

3547
02:52:59.051 --> 02:53:02.760
<v Speaker 1>A hundred hundred like denial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you sure you sure?</v>

<v Speaker 1>replaced,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

3554
02:53:13.481 --> 02:53:16.510
<v Speaker 1>I'm number one.</v>
