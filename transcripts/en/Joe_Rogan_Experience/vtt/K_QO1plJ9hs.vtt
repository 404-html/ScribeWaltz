3
00:00:39.451 --> 00:00:44.451
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It feels like a fucking radio station </v>

4
00:00:44.451 --> 00:00:46.341
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got real chairs instead of those </v>

5
00:00:46.341 --> 00:00:46.341
<v Speaker 1>goofy couches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got rid of that shit.</v>

6
00:00:46.341 --> 00:00:48.480
<v Speaker 1>One of them's at our house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other one's in Brian's place.</v>

7
00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.560
<v Speaker 1>What'd you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what'd you,</v>

8
00:00:49.561 --> 00:00:50.340
<v Speaker 1>by the way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

9
00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:51.180
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

10
00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.820
<v Speaker 1>I think he wants it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now I'm like,</v>

11
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:54.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want your chair.</v>

12
00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:55.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

13
00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.460
<v Speaker 1>Because he has said so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What'd you do last night?</v>

14
00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.090
<v Speaker 1>I went over to Joe's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Help them hook up the studio and he was.</v>

15
00:01:00.091 --> 00:01:03.150
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I think I made to get to that.</v>

16
00:01:03.151 --> 00:01:08.151
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you can't even fit that chair </v>

17
00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:11.391
<v Speaker 1>anywhere in your house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking about doing something </v>

18
00:01:11.391 --> 00:01:13.881
<v Speaker 1>like Joe did pretty much taking out my </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole and my office is just fucking </v>

19
00:01:13.881 --> 00:01:17.691
<v Speaker 1>scary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't even go in my office just too </v>

20
00:01:17.691 --> 00:01:17.691
<v Speaker 1>much shit.</v>

21
00:01:17.691 --> 00:01:17.691
<v Speaker 1>So I think I need to empty the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing out.</v>

22
00:01:17.691 --> 00:01:19.650
<v Speaker 1>Redo it and Redo it from scratch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

23
00:01:19.651 --> 00:01:21.390
<v Speaker 1>I still need to Redo this area back </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

24
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.850
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitches were sponsored by the fleshlight</v>

25
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.460
<v Speaker 1>holiday boys.</v>

<v Speaker 1>50 bucks or 60 bucks or 100 bucks.</v>

29
00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.700
<v Speaker 1>It's worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because think about what a hooker costs </v>

30
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.910
<v Speaker 1>and you could shoot mad loads with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've been watching cops that,</v>

32
00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.810
<v Speaker 1>some of these hookers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like $10.</v>

33
00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:52.650

<v Speaker 1>they look like $10 hookers,</v>

34
00:01:52.651 --> 00:01:57.651
<v Speaker 1>but it's still.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think you want to get a $10 hooker ever </v>

<v Speaker 1>in life.</v>

<v Speaker 1>and he,</v>

91
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.330
<v Speaker 1>he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a determined little fella.</v>

92
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:05.890
<v Speaker 1>Gets crazy ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said,</v>

93
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:07.980
<v Speaker 1>well that's why videos are so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if they,</v>

94
00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:11.290
<v Speaker 1>if he wasn't so determined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't keep going,</v>

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:14.110
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has like all this cool footage and he</v>

96
00:04:14.111 --> 00:04:15.610
<v Speaker 1>puts it together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not enough.</v>

97
00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:20.640
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he always has to add like a million </v>

98
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:21.340
<v Speaker 1>different things and sound tweaks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>very under appreciated.</v>

99
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.930
<v Speaker 1>It's like drive both motivation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like really nice when you meet </v>

100
00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.641
<v Speaker 1>people like that and we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out a way to make money off your </v>

101
00:04:29.641 --> 00:04:31.170
<v Speaker 1>fucking video skills do because you look</v>
<v Speaker 1>at other people's videos online.</v>

102
00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.800
<v Speaker 1>I look at your videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

00:04:32.801 --> 00:04:35.580
<v Speaker 1>you got some fucking mad talent when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a video.</v>

104
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.950
<v Speaker 1>A big problem though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that when,</v>

105
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.050
<v Speaker 1>when I do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do so many layers and so many little </v>

106
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.500
<v Speaker 1>things that no one will ever know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Notice,</v>

107
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like in my head like crazy </v>

108
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.510
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

110
00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.840

<v Speaker 1>So there's a,</v>

111
00:04:49.841 --> 00:04:52.660
<v Speaker 1>there's a artistic quality to these </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos.</v>

112
00:04:52.661 --> 00:04:54.880
<v Speaker 1>It's fun and it makes it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an extra layer.</v>

113
00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:59.881
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the nuttiness and when you're </v>

114
00:04:59.881 --> 00:04:59.881
<v Speaker 1>sipping wine taste.</v>

115
00:04:59.881 --> 00:05:04.720
<v Speaker 1>I tasted oak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it squeezes the last brain juice out of </v>

116
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:04.720
<v Speaker 1>my brain though and after I do one it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

117
00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.320

<v Speaker 1>this had to have been a plot by the </v>

156
00:06:49.641 --> 00:06:49.641
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If what?</v>

<v Speaker 1>with them.</v>

160
00:06:54.181 --> 00:06:55.530
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to kill him while I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>in jail.</v>

161
00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.920
<v Speaker 1>This is a plot dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is he still alive?</v>

162
00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.330

<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

163
00:07:00.331 --> 00:07:03.630
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I was a kid and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole John Gotti thing was going down.</v>

164
00:07:03.631 --> 00:07:06.840
<v Speaker 1>I guess I wasn't too kid like I was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess I was in my twenties when he was</v>

165
00:07:06.841 --> 00:07:10.020
<v Speaker 1>in his prime and it was so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

166
00:07:10.021 --> 00:07:13.560
<v Speaker 1>I didn't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like he was so mocking of the law</v>

167
00:07:13.561 --> 00:07:16.080
<v Speaker 1>enforcement just walking down the street</v>
<v Speaker 1>with fucking,</v>

168
00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.690
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$10,000</v>

169
00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.220
<v Speaker 1>suits on and get in the limousines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was like,</v>

170
00:07:20.221 --> 00:07:21.630
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this guy doesn't.</v>

171
00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:23.430
<v Speaker 1>He's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's ridiculous.</v>

172
00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:25.470
<v Speaker 1>I watched a documentary on the history </v>
<v Speaker 1>channel.</v>

173
00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:27.210
<v Speaker 1>That's not how they're supposed to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

174
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.060
<v Speaker 1>The whole thing about the mob was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they were all like in the,</v>

175
00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:36.120
<v Speaker 1>on the dl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like everybody was staying like Vincent </v>

176
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.080
<v Speaker 1>the Chin Gigante,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a famous monster,</v>

177
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:42.090
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons why he's famous </v>

178
00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:42.090
<v Speaker 1>because he pretended to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was running everything,</v>

179
00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:44.340
<v Speaker 1>but he pretended to be completely insane</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he knew they were after him,</v>

180
00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:47.880
<v Speaker 1>so he would walk around with slippers on</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a bathrobe over his clothes and just</v>

181
00:07:47.881 --> 00:07:49.200
<v Speaker 1>walked on the street and talk to </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

182
00:07:49.201 --> 00:07:52.380
<v Speaker 1>And he would do it all fucking day and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it kept him.</v>

183
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.100
<v Speaker 1>He's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't say he's not crazy.</v>

184
00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.080
<v Speaker 1>So everything he says is fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>useless.</v>

185
00:07:58.081 --> 00:08:03.081
<v Speaker 1>This guy's nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does he or does he not walk down the </v>

186
00:08:03.081 --> 00:08:03.090
<v Speaker 1>street and his underwear talking to </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself all day long?</v>

187
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:03.980
<v Speaker 1>Everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

189
00:08:04.621 --> 00:08:09.621
<v Speaker 1>He does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think that there's no more </v>

190
00:08:09.621 --> 00:08:09.621
<v Speaker 1>talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy walks in,</v>

191
00:08:09.621 --> 00:08:09.630
<v Speaker 1>is under it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

192
00:08:09.631 --> 00:08:11.370
<v Speaker 1>we think he's faking it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can you prove?</v>

193
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.980
<v Speaker 1>And then everybody's faking it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just want free food.</v>

194
00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.320
<v Speaker 1>Who doesn't want free food and a bed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no crazy people.</v>

195
00:08:16.321 --> 00:08:18.120
<v Speaker 1>They're just pretending to be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you take care of him,</v>

196
00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.620
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he can't say that.</v>

197
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.810
<v Speaker 1>You can't judge whether or not someone's</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>

198
00:08:21.811 --> 00:08:25.080
<v Speaker 1>but whoever fucking thought that John </v>
<v Speaker 1>Travolta should be John Gotti.</v>

199
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:25.920
<v Speaker 1>That motherfucker.</v>

250
00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:14.020

<v Speaker 3>I'm just forgetting where I leave my </v>

253
00:10:21.061 --> 00:10:21.500
<v Speaker 3>keys every five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

254
00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:24.230
<v Speaker 3>you're not supposed to start fighting </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're like 43 where I was.</v>

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.820
<v Speaker 3>I was 36,000,</v>
<v Speaker 3>37.</v>

256
00:10:25.821 --> 00:10:30.821
<v Speaker 3>Then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what's crazy about this hershel </v>

257
00:10:30.821 --> 00:10:34.181
<v Speaker 3>walker character,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know herschel walker football </v>

258
00:10:34.181 --> 00:10:36.251
<v Speaker 3>player,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know the story behind this swipe </v>

259
00:10:36.251 --> 00:10:36.251
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this 48 years old.</v>

260
00:10:36.251 --> 00:10:37.190
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Heisman trophy winner.</v>

261
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:42.370
<v Speaker 3>Super athlete just as fucking prime </v>
<v Speaker 3>example of like perfect athleticism.</v>

262
00:10:43.041 --> 00:10:46.130
<v Speaker 3>But this was a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a long,</v>

263
00:10:46.131 --> 00:10:47.330
<v Speaker 3>long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>long time ago.</v>

264
00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:50.130
<v Speaker 3>And in this whole time where he hasn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>been playing football,</v>

265
00:10:50.131 --> 00:10:53.330
<v Speaker 3>it's just been a few years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He stayed in insane shape.</v>

266
00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:58.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean the guy's like super fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>dedicated to training and now he's like </v>

267
00:10:58.510 --> 00:11:01.451
<v Speaker 3>48 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Going to be 49 soon and he's fighting </v>

268
00:11:01.451 --> 00:11:01.730
<v Speaker 3>this weekend on strikeforce and </v>
<v Speaker 3>showtime.</v>

269
00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:04.000
<v Speaker 3>It's become like an mma fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of fun,</v>

270
00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.590
<v Speaker 4>but it's okay because he could still </v>
<v Speaker 4>fight and all that,</v>

271
00:11:05.591 --> 00:11:07.150
<v Speaker 4>but he's just not going to repair as </v>
<v Speaker 4>fast.</v>

272
00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:07.900
<v Speaker 4>If he gets injured,</v>

273
00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:10.730
<v Speaker 3>he's an amazing shape or it just doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 3>even make sense.</v>

274
00:11:10.731 --> 00:11:13.940
<v Speaker 3>There was no 48 year olds that were </v>
<v Speaker 3>built like that when I was a kid.</v>

275
00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:18.970
<v Speaker 3>When you were 48,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were someone's dad and maybe had </v>

276
00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:19.660
<v Speaker 3>like old man strength in your arms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you probably had a pot belly,</v>

277
00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:24.760
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or at least a little bit of a gut and </v>

278
00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:24.760
<v Speaker 3>you know you're probably scary because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you know you would.</v>

279
00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:29.770
<v Speaker 3>You would hit someone first,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but no one looked like fucking herschel </v>

280
00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:29.770
<v Speaker 3>walker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

281
00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:31.190
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't look like an old man that you</v>
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't fuck with</v>

282
00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:35.690

<v Speaker 4>full fucking eight pack.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Not an ounce of fat on his body.</v>

284
00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:42.350
<v Speaker 4>And here's the crazy shit he says.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He only eats soup and salad.</v>

285
00:11:42.351 --> 00:11:47.351
<v Speaker 4>he has one meal a day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like everything about this guy screams </v>

286
00:11:47.351 --> 00:11:49.160
<v Speaker 4>that he's a fucking alien or bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I only eats super sad.</v>

287
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:53.030
<v Speaker 4>It's all water soluble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He'd be dying.</v>

288
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:55.900
<v Speaker 4>It needs meet.</v>

<v Speaker 4>soup.</v>

291
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.080

<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Here's the other thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>beCause he wants to.</v>

296
00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:06.880
<v Speaker 4>He his,</v>

<v Speaker 4>but.</v>

298
00:12:08.530 --> 00:12:12.910
<v Speaker 4>Well he's obviously fucking insanely </v>
<v Speaker 4>dedicated but he might be crazy like for</v>

<v Speaker 4>past.</v>

302
00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.770

304
00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:29.290

305
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:32.641
<v Speaker 4>different than the part that talks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The part that talks doesn't get access </v>

00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:01.430
<v Speaker 1>but you're not allowed to give babies </v>

<v Speaker 5>what was it?</v>

378
00:15:10.451 --> 00:15:15.451
<v Speaker 5>You just had five cheese pizzas when I </v>
<v Speaker 5>was 15 years old and in the lunch line </v>

379
00:15:15.451 --> 00:15:16.900
<v Speaker 5>they had these like cheese and a bagels </v>
<v Speaker 5>that were so good.</v>

380
00:15:17.170 --> 00:15:19.840
<v Speaker 5>So I got one and I ate it and I was </v>
<v Speaker 5>supposed to meet this guy had a crush on</v>

<v Speaker 5>yet.</v>

385
00:15:27.821 --> 00:15:28.870
<v Speaker 5>So he'd pick me up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

386
00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.360

<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

388
00:15:32.230 --> 00:15:34.900
<v Speaker 5>I don't fucking know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The next day I tested it out again.</v>

389
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:37.460
<v Speaker 1>She ran in the bathroom and the battle </v>
<v Speaker 1>was over.</v>

390
00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.920
<v Speaker 1>Did you even check to see if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>toilet's clean?</v>

391
00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:43.400
<v Speaker 1>Sort of a cleansing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a cleansing.</v>

392
00:15:43.401 --> 00:15:44.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking dirty thing man.</v>

393
00:15:44.991 --> 00:15:49.991
<v Speaker 1>When you have to take a shit in a public</v>
<v Speaker 1>toilet rub and sweaty ass with some </v>

394
00:15:49.991 --> 00:15:51.770
<v Speaker 1>stranger in everybody's sweats on those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

395
00:15:51.771 --> 00:15:52.070
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

396
00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:53.270
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Seat cover.</v>

397
00:15:53.570 --> 00:15:58.570
<v Speaker 5>the seat covers are stupid too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>and then like when you're done with it </v>

398
00:15:58.570 --> 00:15:59.160
<v Speaker 5>and it kind of grabs onto the water and </v>
<v Speaker 5>flushes down with it,</v>

399
00:15:59.161 --> 00:16:04.161
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that little arm and shit smeared all </v>

400
00:16:04.161 --> 00:16:04.161
<v Speaker 5>over it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

401
00:16:04.161 --> 00:16:07.830
<v Speaker 1>They always look stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It never looks like it's supposed to be </v>

402
00:16:07.830 --> 00:16:07.830
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It never looks neat and tidy.</v>

403
00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:09.640
<v Speaker 1>So you go in there and blast out of your</v>
<v Speaker 1>ass.</v>

404
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.440
<v Speaker 1>And then what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you not go to this guy's house?</v>

405
00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:12.550
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

406
00:16:12.610 --> 00:16:14.980
<v Speaker 1>I never knew what could have happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crush like man's confidence.</v>

407
00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.150
<v Speaker 1>You could have changed his whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that over.</v>

408
00:16:17.151 --> 00:16:17.330
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

409
00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:19.290
<v Speaker 5>we actually wound up dating though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're a high school.</v>

410
00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:21.780
<v Speaker 5>So that was the thing though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That pushed it over the edge.</v>

411
00:16:21.781 --> 00:16:24.280
<v Speaker 5>That was your last year,</v>
<v Speaker 5>first thing,</v>

412
00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:26.700
<v Speaker 5>that and that ever since then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>anything you were maybe,</v>

413
00:16:26.701 --> 00:16:28.770
<v Speaker 5>which is the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you tried just to eat a pizza?</v>

414
00:16:28.810 --> 00:16:29.550
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

415
00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.340
<v Speaker 5>I could do with like lactose enzymes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is like the supplement,</v>

416
00:16:32.341 --> 00:16:37.341
<v Speaker 5>like lactaid or something and pizza.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if I have it without like five </v>

417
00:16:37.341 --> 00:16:38.260
<v Speaker 5>minutes later.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So that just gives your body.</v>

418
00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.380
<v Speaker 5>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>have you ever tried raw milk?</v>

419
00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:41.220
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

420
00:16:41.221 --> 00:16:43.050
<v Speaker 5>I've tried almond milk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And all that</v>

421
00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:46.460
<v Speaker 1>raw milk has a that it's not pasteurized</v>
<v Speaker 1>or homogenized,</v>

422
00:16:46.461 --> 00:16:51.461
<v Speaker 1>so it's got all the live cultures in it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's supposed to be much easier to </v>

423
00:16:51.461 --> 00:16:54.850
<v Speaker 1>digest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had a bunch of times at whole </v>

424
00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:54.850
<v Speaker 1>foods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think they carry it anymore.</v>

425
00:16:54.850 --> 00:16:58.871
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure if they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I couldn't find it the other day </v>

426
00:16:58.871 --> 00:16:58.871
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of people think it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>creepy because it's,</v>

427
00:16:58.871 --> 00:17:03.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just fucking run out of the cow's </v>

428
00:17:03.571 --> 00:17:03.571
<v Speaker 1>tit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

429
00:17:03.571 --> 00:17:03.571
<v Speaker 1>And it's in like five days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible.</v>

430
00:17:03.571 --> 00:17:04.790
<v Speaker 1>And like after the first couple of days </v>
<v Speaker 1>is good,</v>

431
00:17:04.791 --> 00:17:09.791
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of not healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That milk just sits in your fucking </v>

432
00:17:09.791 --> 00:17:10.640
<v Speaker 1>refrigerator for two weeks and doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>go bad.</v>

433
00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:12.770
<v Speaker 5>That seems like the worst milk you could</v>
<v Speaker 5>ever drink though.</v>

434
00:17:12.771 --> 00:17:14.570
<v Speaker 5>That seems like the most hardest core </v>
<v Speaker 5>milk.</v>

435
00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:19.580
<v Speaker 5>Every job's a tv and yeah it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When they milked the cow though,</v>

436
00:17:20.841 --> 00:17:24.080
<v Speaker 5>a lot of the times they get feces on </v>
<v Speaker 5>their hands when they're milking</v>

437
00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:27.810
<v Speaker 1>a little feces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Feces in your diet keeps you strong.</v>

438
00:17:28.590 --> 00:17:30.480
<v Speaker 1>You need to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to have battles.</v>

439
00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:32.500
<v Speaker 1>We did the your immune system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

440
00:17:32.501 --> 00:17:34.350
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when you get a flu,</v>

441
00:17:34.351 --> 00:17:37.560
<v Speaker 1>it's good for your immune system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your immune system fires up and the next</v>

442
00:17:37.561 --> 00:17:40.170
<v Speaker 1>time the food comes around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the immune system is not so fast.</v>

443
00:17:40.171 --> 00:17:41.850
<v Speaker 1>Bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why I never get the flu shot.</v>

444
00:17:41.851 --> 00:17:46.851
<v Speaker 1>Or we'd get a little poop in your body </v>
<v Speaker 1>and your body and then you could fight </v>

445
00:17:46.851 --> 00:17:46.851
<v Speaker 1>off disease better.</v>

446
00:17:46.851 --> 00:17:48.400
<v Speaker 5>We had this podcast last night,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that naughty show,</v>

447
00:17:48.401 --> 00:17:50.060
<v Speaker 5>podcast number.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We had this porn star</v>

448
00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:55.060
<v Speaker 4>on it and she was talking about how she </v>
<v Speaker 4>right after the shoes,</v>

449
00:17:56.190 --> 00:18:01.190
<v Speaker 4>I forget what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was getting fucked in the ass or </v>

450
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:04.250
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then never in life should you ever </v>

451
00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:06.030
<v Speaker 4>be in a position where like I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting fucked,</v>

452
00:18:06.130 --> 00:18:09.270
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>fucking.</v>

<v Speaker 1>when men and women are doing it in </v>

591
00:24:09.761 --> 00:24:12.551
<v Speaker 1>public,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't have a problem with anybody </v>

<v Speaker 1>guys kissing?</v>

605
00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:34.790

<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know they don't want everything to do </v>

622
00:24:59.451 --> 00:24:59.451
<v Speaker 1>with me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter.</v>

623
00:24:59.451 --> 00:24:59.451
<v Speaker 1>I've seen instincts like get the fuck </v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:04.250
<v Speaker 5>kinda like watched because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's interesting.</v>

626
00:25:04.250 --> 00:25:04.500
<v Speaker 5>It just looks different,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

627
00:25:04.570 --> 00:25:07.820
<v Speaker 5>like far as looking at it an alien or </v>
<v Speaker 5>investigating it.</v>

628
00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:10.480
<v Speaker 1>I wish I would if I could be a neuter </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a day.</v>

629
00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:12.750
<v Speaker 1>That's how I feel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neutering people.</v>

630
00:25:12.830 --> 00:25:13.180
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

631
00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:17.560
<v Speaker 1>Like if I wasn't a man or a woman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I could be sexless for a day,</v>

632
00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:20.290
<v Speaker 1>then I could probably look at it like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that and like to look at it like that.</v>

633
00:25:20.291 --> 00:25:20.800
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

634
00:25:20.801 --> 00:25:23.170
<v Speaker 1>from a scientific point of view in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>boss is fascinating.</v>

635
00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:28.380
<v Speaker 1>Like what is that like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's their return on like I don't </v>

636
00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:29.040
<v Speaker 1>understand like when girls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anytime a girl is ever been attracted to</v>

637
00:25:29.050 --> 00:25:30.520
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always been like really?</v>

638
00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:32.290
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck do you like?</v>

641
00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:37.360
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's ridiculous.</v>

642
00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:39.470
<v Speaker 1>Like it doesn't make any sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

643
00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.920
<v Speaker 1>for a man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't make any sense that women are</v>

644
00:25:41.921 --> 00:25:46.921
<v Speaker 1>attracted to men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand they do have a long </v>

645
00:25:46.921 --> 00:25:47.290
<v Speaker 1>lifelong history of experience of seeing</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

646
00:25:47.291 --> 00:25:49.300
<v Speaker 1>Seeing girls be attracted to men.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I know it's real.</v>

647
00:25:49.630 --> 00:25:50.700
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I don't get it.</v>

648
00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:54.220
<v Speaker 1>But when it's a guy and a guys attracted</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a guy,</v>

649
00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:55.360
<v Speaker 1>then it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

650
00:25:55.361 --> 00:25:57.210
<v Speaker 1>this is like super alien.</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

651
00:25:57.270 --> 00:26:02.270

<v Speaker 5>Something we've never lived or </v>

652
00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:02.270
<v Speaker 5>experienced,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

653
00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:02.370
<v Speaker 5>We're never going to be able to know </v>
<v Speaker 5>what that feels.</v>

654
00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:05.030
<v Speaker 1>And that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's weird with like kids that's weird</v>

00:29:50.930 --> 00:29:50.930
<v Speaker 1>attractive.</v>

<v Speaker 1>vaginas or mouths or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like ms dot firing in the </v>

<v Speaker 1>The way one person's brain works and </v>
<v Speaker 1>other persons doesn't.</v>

762
00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:29.640
<v Speaker 1>I was telling you guys about this before</v>
<v Speaker 1>we started the podcast and I saw this </v>

763
00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:32.610
<v Speaker 1>horrible video online or there's two </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids are skateboarding in front of this </v>

764
00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:36.450
<v Speaker 1>guy's house and the guy comes out and </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell them to stop skateboard and they </v>

765
00:30:36.450 --> 00:30:36.450
<v Speaker 1>are like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>and they they're getting sort of sort of</v>

767
00:30:38.261 --> 00:30:39.280
<v Speaker 1>like a pushing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoving,</v>

768
00:30:39.281 --> 00:30:44.281
<v Speaker 1>sort of a little situation and the man </v>
<v Speaker 1>runs into the house and grabs a gun and </v>

769
00:30:44.281 --> 00:30:45.880
<v Speaker 1>guns down these two kids right in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>street.</v>

00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:49.180
<v Speaker 1>IT's all in the security live leak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing.</v>

771
00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:52.180
<v Speaker 1>Or it was on youtube because it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that graphic.</v>

772
00:30:52.181 --> 00:30:55.450
<v Speaker 1>You can see him shooting from a security</v>
<v Speaker 1>camera from like the front of his house.</v>

773
00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:57.160
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking horrible.</v>

774
00:30:57.190 --> 00:30:58.090
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you think that,</v>

775
00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.370
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an argument between someone who wants to</v>

776
00:31:00.371 --> 00:31:05.371
<v Speaker 1>skateboard and some guy who doesn't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to hear noise can turn into some man </v>

777
00:31:05.371 --> 00:31:05.530
<v Speaker 1>gunning down someone's children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

781
00:31:12.691 --> 00:31:13.750
<v Speaker 1>someone's brain can actually be wired </v>
<v Speaker 1>that way or they just want to go out and</v>

782
00:31:13.751 --> 00:31:18.751
<v Speaker 1>just shoot somebody who's making too </v>
<v Speaker 1>much noise and it's so crazy how random </v>

<v Speaker 1>day,</v>

786
00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:27.040

<v Speaker 1>what can happen?</v>

788
00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:32.470
<v Speaker 1>It can happen easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a guy out here that shot a cop</v>

789
00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:35.500
<v Speaker 1>podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last podcast.</v>

790
00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:40.920
<v Speaker 1>Fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking nutty world and as the </v>

791
00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:43.710
<v Speaker 1>economy gets shittier and shittier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people get more and more desperate and </v>

792
00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:43.710
<v Speaker 1>more and more things like this are gonna</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

793
00:31:43.710 --> 00:31:44.890
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

794
00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.770
<v Speaker 1>there's a lack of balance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

795
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:52.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how it comes back around,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it ain't going to come back around </v>

796
00:31:52.830 --> 00:31:55.801
<v Speaker 1>the way we're rocking it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just so many fucking criminals </v>

797
00:31:55.801 --> 00:31:56.410
<v Speaker 1>to get guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't you have one?</v>

798
00:31:56.740 --> 00:32:01.390
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

799
00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:02.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

800
00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:04.210
<v Speaker 1>you want to get a gun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like 600 bucks.</v>

801
00:32:04.211 --> 00:32:06.580
<v Speaker 1>That's a pretty big purchase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that much.</v>

802
00:32:06.910 --> 00:32:11.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm guessing like decent ones and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's probably a thing that you can </v>

803
00:32:11.910 --> 00:32:13.840
<v Speaker 1>kill somebody and it's only 600 bucks </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheaper than that.</v>

804
00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:15.160
<v Speaker 1>It's probably 20 bucks.</v>

805
00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:18.460
<v Speaker 1>If you go in the right places on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>streets and you get a cheap gun,</v>

<v Speaker 1>So you got to do your own taxes and most</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these guys are lazy as fuck.</v>

830
00:33:15.831 --> 00:33:17.390
<v Speaker 1>they didn't do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just took that money.</v>

831
00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:18.500
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

832
00:33:18.501 --> 00:33:23.501
<v Speaker 1>years and years of these comedy clubs </v>

<v Speaker 1>It's just really bad.</v>

835
00:33:26.090 --> 00:33:27.160
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of them are,</v>

<v Speaker 1>What do you do if you can,</v>

839
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:35.300

840
00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:37.640

<v Speaker 2>coming in and out?</v>

1039
00:41:22.341 --> 00:41:25.320

<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

1053

<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 4>last week.</v>

1059
00:42:02.090 --> 00:42:07.090
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>last week my daughter married this man </v>

1060
00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:07.090
<v Speaker 4>and I tried to tell her to stay away </v>
<v Speaker 4>from this fellow,</v>

1061
00:42:07.090 --> 00:42:08.210
<v Speaker 4>but she didn't want to listen and you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>That shit was like a beaten woman.</v>

1066
00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:19.880
<v Speaker 4>You're afraid of men.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You become a lesbian who become a social</v>

<v Speaker 4>cannot,</v>

1086
00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.790
<v Speaker 4>you cannot hit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She did that last thing like,</v>

1087
00:43:05.630 --> 00:43:09.280
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of like feeling being silenced like</v>

<v Speaker 4>Well sort of,</v>

1089
00:43:11.031 --> 00:43:16.031
<v Speaker 4>but maybe she's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that's the only way to get her </v>

1090
00:43:16.031 --> 00:43:16.031
<v Speaker 4>away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1091
00:43:16.031 --> 00:43:17.450
<v Speaker 4>maybe she would've just sat down with us</v>
<v Speaker 4>and started talking to us.</v>

1092
00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:22.560
<v Speaker 4>So some people just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people need those checks just </v>

1093
00:43:22.560 --> 00:43:24.250
<v Speaker 4>because there's always going to do it </v>
<v Speaker 4>unless somebody does say something,</v>

1094
00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:28.130
<v Speaker 4>be fucking bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you could test drive people's brains,</v>

1104
00:43:43.820 --> 00:43:45.220

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1105
00:43:45.221 --> 00:43:50.221
<v Speaker 4>if you could like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to know what it feels like to be </v>

1106
00:43:50.221 --> 00:43:50.221
<v Speaker 4>a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you pilot allison?</v>

1107
00:43:50.221 --> 00:43:50.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for like just pilot around the house for</v>

1108
00:43:50.571 --> 00:43:55.571
<v Speaker 4>like an hour and shula and she just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she just stay silent and lets you move </v>

1109
00:43:55.571 --> 00:43:57.290
<v Speaker 4>around and look through her eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She knows her in there.</v>

1110
00:43:57.291 --> 00:44:00.380
<v Speaker 4>She left In there and you can move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She goes silent.</v>

1111
00:44:00.381 --> 00:44:05.381
<v Speaker 4>You walk around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you move her body around you finger </v>

1112
00:44:05.381 --> 00:44:05.450
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can do whatever you want.</v>

1113
00:44:05.451 --> 00:44:09.410
<v Speaker 4>You have her body for one hour and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>a trigger to get into sleep with a bunch</v>

1114
00:44:09.411 --> 00:44:11.870
<v Speaker 4>of guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I would do that.</v>

1115
00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:14.330
<v Speaker 4>Oh definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Finger myself though for sure.</v>

1116
00:44:14.331 --> 00:44:16.700
<v Speaker 4>Wouldn't you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would do that stuff,</v>

1117
00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:21.110
<v Speaker 4>I would pee on myself and all that crap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You realize when you,</v>

1118
00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:23.420
<v Speaker 4>when you start using a flashlight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1119
00:44:23.421 --> 00:44:25.850
<v Speaker 4>sex is way better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's pretty fucking good.</v>

1120
00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.280
<v Speaker 4>And that's why girls like girls with </v>
<v Speaker 4>dildos,</v>

1121
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:31.200
<v Speaker 4>like I never got that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1122
00:44:31.201 --> 00:44:32.000
<v Speaker 4>why don't you stick some</v>

1123
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:34.590
<v Speaker 1>remembered inside yet it's not as good </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a real dick,</v>

1124
00:44:34.591 --> 00:44:36.480
<v Speaker 1>but I bet it's probably pretty fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>close.</v>

1125
00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:38.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>girls.</v>

1126
00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:39.990
<v Speaker 1>I would definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I would,</v>

1127
00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:45.010
<v Speaker 1>I would 10 minutes I'd finger myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would try to have sex with another </v>

1128
00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:46.020
<v Speaker 1>woman while it was that really tried to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make out with her.</v>

1129
00:44:46.050 --> 00:44:46.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1130
00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:48.870
<v Speaker 1>And what have you turned midnight and </v>
<v Speaker 1>turn into a pumpkin.</v>

1131
00:44:48.871 --> 00:44:53.871
<v Speaker 1>Like point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like 1158,</v>

1132
00:44:53.941 --> 00:44:58.941
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be great right now if I was a guy </v>

1133
00:44:58.941 --> 00:44:58.941
<v Speaker 1>and are a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not attracted to guys ever since</v>

1134
00:44:58.941 --> 00:44:59.880
<v Speaker 1>my uncle touched me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really only attracted to.</v>

1135
00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:03.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forgot to tell you I was going to turn</v>

1136
00:45:03.661 --> 00:45:06.140
<v Speaker 1>into a dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We keep going,</v>

1137
00:45:06.170 --> 00:45:11.170
<v Speaker 1>keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be cool if you could keep </v>

1138
00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:11.170
<v Speaker 1>going because you'd already be horny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then she'd be fine,</v>

1139
00:45:11.170 --> 00:45:15.471
<v Speaker 1>I creeped out because she just told You </v>
<v Speaker 1>about her uncle and then also in a big </v>

1140
00:45:15.471 --> 00:45:16.190
<v Speaker 1>part decks in front of her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if I saw that actually happen,</v>

1141
00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:19.050
<v Speaker 1>I would probably freak the fuck out.</v>

1142
00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:26.450
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine just morphing like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there are certain animals that </v>

1143
00:45:26.450 --> 00:45:26.970
<v Speaker 1>changed sex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not unusual in nature.</v>

1144
00:45:26.971 --> 00:45:30.710
<v Speaker 1>It happens in a bunch of situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certain animals start off as a woman and</v>

1145
00:45:30.711 --> 00:45:34.680
<v Speaker 1>they become a male or vice a versa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they can change dependent on certain</v>

1146
00:45:34.681 --> 00:45:39.681
<v Speaker 1>insects and certain worms and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they can change dependent on </v>

1147
00:45:39.681 --> 00:45:41.430
<v Speaker 1>whether or not there's enough males or </v>
<v Speaker 1>females in the population.</v>

1148
00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:43.940
<v Speaker 1>It's variable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1149
00:45:43.941 --> 00:45:45.810
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch of like simple organisms</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can do that.</v>

1150
00:45:45.930 --> 00:45:49.560
<v Speaker 1>So if simple organisms could do that,</v>

1154
00:46:02.421 --> 00:46:05.040

<v Speaker 4>what's that guy making?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He made that movie where everyone's in a</v>

1239
00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:44.440
<v Speaker 4>same thing happened in my theory.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been talked about that before.</v>

1240
00:49:44.440 --> 00:49:48.100
<v Speaker 4>I've seen it three times that the devil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when it came on it,</v>

1241
00:49:48.110 --> 00:49:50.380
<v Speaker 4>everyone just started going,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1242
00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:57.000
<v Speaker 4>this looks cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that mother of that fucking </v>

1243
00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:57.000
<v Speaker 4>disappointing cock sucker,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he needs to change his name.</v>

1244
00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:57.880
<v Speaker 4>No man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm telling you.</v>

1245
00:49:57.881 --> 00:50:00.130
<v Speaker 4>The devil movie was pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I liked that movie.</v>

1246
00:50:00.131 --> 00:50:01.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I took a chance.</v>

1247
00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:04.210
<v Speaker 4>I'm desperate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm desperate for good horror movie.</v>

1248
00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:09.500
<v Speaker 4>But it seems like he's getting gotten to</v>
<v Speaker 4>a point where a lot of people probably </v>

1249
00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:11.770
<v Speaker 4>aren't going to watch that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did not direct this.</v>

1250
00:50:11.771 --> 00:50:16.771
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he just produced it bro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>

1251
00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:19.860
<v Speaker 4>you might've cost yourself $50 million </v>
<v Speaker 4>bite.</v>

1252
00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:23.980
<v Speaker 4>I was doing tech support two months ago </v>
<v Speaker 4>and as I was working from home I'd watch</v>

1253
00:50:23.981 --> 00:50:27.350
<v Speaker 4>horror movies over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like just random ones on netflix.</v>

1254
00:50:27.351 --> 00:50:28.120
<v Speaker 4>And I like watched probably</v>

1255
00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:32.060
<v Speaker 5>like two a day to the point where like </v>
<v Speaker 5>two weeks went by and I'm like I need to</v>

1256

<v Speaker 5>I had like weird dreams and shit.</v>

1258
00:50:37.150 --> 00:50:40.120

<v Speaker 1>like because there's a bunch of movies </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are really good movies that don't </v>

<v Speaker 1>when with certain dudes like their name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like m night shambhala dinged on is the </v>

1265
00:50:56.811 --> 00:51:00.601
<v Speaker 1>number one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name is just immediately associated </v>

1266
00:51:00.601 --> 00:51:00.850
<v Speaker 1>with all of his movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he fail at that?</v>

1267
00:51:00.851 --> 00:51:04.690
<v Speaker 1>Everybody hates him so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also go one with the sixth sense was the</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was good enough.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I think the human centipede was the last</v>

1289
00:51:52.511 --> 00:51:57.511
<v Speaker 1>one I Watched.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I got and I didn't want.</v>

1292
00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:05.550
<v Speaker 5>I watch it for the creek festival.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's one of those movies I was </v>

1293
00:52:05.550 --> 00:52:06.530
<v Speaker 5>going to turn off after the first 20 </v>
<v Speaker 5>minutes.</v>

1294
00:52:06.531 --> 00:52:11.531
<v Speaker 5>I just wanted to get a taste of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then I kind of got addicted to the </v>

1295
00:52:11.531 --> 00:52:12.050
<v Speaker 5>fact that it was so creepy and I was </v>
<v Speaker 5>just like,</v>

1296
00:52:12.051 --> 00:52:14.330
<v Speaker 5>I got to see what's happening here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1297
00:52:14.331 --> 00:52:16.130
<v Speaker 5>it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't like it,</v>

1298
00:52:16.131 --> 00:52:17.130
<v Speaker 5>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1299
00:52:17.160 --> 00:52:20.630
<v Speaker 5>it's definitely worth seeing just </v>
<v Speaker 5>because the characters in it are fucking</v>

1300
00:52:20.631 --> 00:52:22.730
<v Speaker 5>creepy as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you seen that?</v>

1301
00:52:22.731 --> 00:52:24.320
<v Speaker 5>Maybe shutter island?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

1302
00:52:24.350 --> 00:52:29.350
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That one was not surprising and </v>

1303
00:52:29.350 --> 00:52:31.691
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but there's a movie called madhouse and </v>

1304
00:52:31.691 --> 00:52:31.691
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't surprising because you kind of</v>
<v Speaker 5>knew it was going to Happen.</v>

1305
00:52:31.691 --> 00:52:31.700
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1306
00:52:31.701 --> 00:52:32.990
<v Speaker 5>he's obviously going to be the crazy </v>
<v Speaker 5>person.</v>

1307
00:52:33.040 --> 00:52:37.510
<v Speaker 1>That movie was a hot subject of debate </v>
<v Speaker 1>amongst me and my friends.</v>

1308
00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:38.370
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1309
00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:41.900
<v Speaker 1>Most of us thought like I went to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>you with sikora and with uh,</v>

1310
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:44.290
<v Speaker 1>eddie bravo and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they both.</v>

1311
00:52:44.350 --> 00:52:49.350
<v Speaker 1>We all thought that it Was a bad movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I felt like you can't just show me a </v>

1312
00:52:49.350 --> 00:52:51.130
<v Speaker 1>bunch of shit and then say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1313
00:52:51.131 --> 00:52:53.170
<v Speaker 1>psych.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was crazy the whole time.</v>

1314
00:52:53.171 --> 00:52:54.190
<v Speaker 1>It was all a dream.</v>

1315
00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:58.350
<v Speaker 5>If you go on like a netflix look at </v>
<v Speaker 5>madhouse just like shutter island,</v>

1316
00:52:58.351 --> 00:53:01.650
<v Speaker 5>but with like unknown actors,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really completely better story.</v>

1317
00:53:01.651 --> 00:53:06.651
<v Speaker 5>Better ending.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I wished that one made it to </v>

1318
00:53:06.651 --> 00:53:06.651
<v Speaker 5>theaters.</v>

1319
00:53:06.651 --> 00:53:06.651
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shutter island,</v>

1320
00:53:06.651 --> 00:53:09.250
<v Speaker 1>whenever it looked bad ass and it seemed</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of interesting,</v>

1321
00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:11.530
<v Speaker 1>but when you found out that he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>

1322
00:53:11.531 --> 00:53:16.531
<v Speaker 1>like halfway there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was one point in time when you </v>

1323
00:53:16.531 --> 00:53:16.531
<v Speaker 1>kind of knew that things were a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonky,</v>

1324
00:53:16.531 --> 00:53:21.511
<v Speaker 1>like okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is all of a sudden we've entered </v>

1325
00:53:21.511 --> 00:53:21.610
<v Speaker 1>into this unrealistic micozzie climbing </v>
<v Speaker 1>up these mountains,</v>

1326
00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:23.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the ocean,</v>

1327
00:53:23.201 --> 00:53:25.210
<v Speaker 1>remember that part by the ocean when </v>
<v Speaker 1>climbed in the cave.</v>

1328
00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:27.540
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how can you start thinking,</v>

1329
00:53:27.541 --> 00:53:29.550
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>obviously it's crazy like it's going on,</v>

1330
00:53:29.551 --> 00:53:33.330
<v Speaker 3>but you can't have a movie where you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have everything makes sense and then all</v>

1331
00:53:33.331 --> 00:53:35.010
<v Speaker 3>the sudden it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And oh,</v>

1332
00:53:35.011 --> 00:53:37.290
<v Speaker 3>it was a dream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's like a cheap trick,</v>

1333
00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:39.180
<v Speaker 3>like a slap in the face to all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>viewers.</v>

1334
00:53:39.181 --> 00:53:40.160
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean I get,</v>

1335
00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:42.090
<v Speaker 3>I get,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're trying to be crafty.</v>

1336
00:53:42.330 --> 00:53:43.920
<v Speaker 3>It just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's successful.</v>

1337
00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.480
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think it was good.</v>

1338
00:53:45.790 --> 00:53:50.790
<v Speaker 3>I wonder how some of these get put out </v>
<v Speaker 3>and pass all the people they need to </v>

1339
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:50.790
<v Speaker 3>pass and then it gets such bad viewer </v>
<v Speaker 3>responses.</v>

1340
00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:56.020
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the big part about the whole movie </v>

1341
00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:56.020
<v Speaker 3>business is the producers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The big part about the movie business is</v>

1342
00:53:56.020 --> 00:53:58.190
<v Speaker 3>that people that come up with the money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's not just,</v>

1343
00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:03.400
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a bunch of different people get </v>

1344
00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:03.400
<v Speaker 3>involved.</v>

1345
00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:03.400
<v Speaker 3>They,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1346
00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:05.910
<v Speaker 3>it's not just the people who wrote it or</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people who were performing the </v>

1347
00:54:05.910 --> 00:54:09.611
<v Speaker 3>characters.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of other shit behind the </v>

1348
00:54:09.611 --> 00:54:09.611
<v Speaker 3>scenes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1349
00:54:09.611 --> 00:54:12.240
<v Speaker 3>and there's a lot of cooks and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody's got their own idea of what </v>

1350
00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:15.131
<v Speaker 3>you should be in and should be not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I've seen a bunch Of things that </v>

1351
00:54:15.131 --> 00:54:15.350
<v Speaker 3>were really good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>get fucked up a bunch of things.</v>

1352
00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:20.560
<v Speaker 3>The man show and doug and I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That got all fucked up by other people </v>

1353
00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:21.530
<v Speaker 3>involved looking at the screen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>worn it movie man.</v>

1354
00:54:21.531 --> 00:54:23.620

<v Speaker 3>like somebody.</v>

1355
00:54:23.621 --> 00:54:25.400
<v Speaker 3>I was going to say that the best example</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was,</v>

1356
00:54:25.410 --> 00:54:27.290
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was a movie that I did a long time</v>

1357
00:54:27.291 --> 00:54:28.880
<v Speaker 3>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a terrible movie.</v>

1358
00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:33.920
<v Speaker 3>It was called frank mccluskey.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cei or pii private investigator,</v>

1359
00:54:33.921 --> 00:54:34.800
<v Speaker 3>I think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Anyway,</v>

1360
00:54:34.801 --> 00:54:36.050
<v Speaker 3>it was this kid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget his name,</v>

1361
00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:37.370
<v Speaker 3>dave,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's the lead,</v>

1362
00:54:37.371 --> 00:54:39.580
<v Speaker 3>who's a really funny guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and uh,</v>

1363
00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:41.570
<v Speaker 3>he was doing all these different.</v>

1364
00:54:41.570 --> 00:54:46.570
<v Speaker 3>I Should respect to him find out what </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck his last name is at green horn </v>

1365
00:54:47.331 --> 00:54:50.000
<v Speaker 3>immediAte looks fucking now I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>wondering if it's supposed to be funny,</v>

1366
00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:52.110
<v Speaker 3>but what I'm saying is with this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I did this,</v>

1367
00:54:52.111 --> 00:54:56.600
<v Speaker 3>this movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm dave sheridan,</v>

1368
00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:58.100
<v Speaker 3>that's his name,</v>
<v Speaker 3>did this movie,</v>

1369
00:54:58.101 --> 00:54:59.960
<v Speaker 3>this fucking kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hilarious.</v>

1370
00:55:00.050 --> 00:55:02.000
<v Speaker 3>And he would have in him and his friend </v>
<v Speaker 3>wrote it,</v>

1371
00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:03.470
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he had like,</v>

1372
00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:08.560
<v Speaker 3>they were like going over the scenes and</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the best way to make them funny </v>

1373
00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:09.110
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and the dude was really good.</v>

1374
00:55:09.111 --> 00:55:10.700
<v Speaker 3>Like he's a really good actor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was in like,</v>

1375
00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.150
<v Speaker 3>like I'm a scary movie and it's been in </v>
<v Speaker 3>a bunch of different films.</v>

1376
00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:15.390
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

1377
00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:18.110
<v Speaker 3>he's performing the scene and it like </v>
<v Speaker 3>he'll come in and,</v>

1378
00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:20.090
<v Speaker 3>and hit it his way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's all these.</v>

1379
00:55:20.280 --> 00:55:21.710
<v Speaker 3>No one knows who this guy is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1380
00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:26.800
<v Speaker 3>So there's all these suits in the room </v>
<v Speaker 3>and these guys would like fucking </v>

1381
00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:28.070
<v Speaker 3>expensive cufflinks and rolex watches </v>
<v Speaker 3>and suspenders.</v>

1382
00:55:28.190 --> 00:55:32.600
<v Speaker 3>And they're given this dude literally </v>
<v Speaker 3>giving him takes like do it like this.</v>

1383
00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:36.800
<v Speaker 3>Like when you walk in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want you to blow like this.</v>

1384
00:55:36.860 --> 00:55:39.650
<v Speaker 3>I watched this guy do this and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is what happens.</v>

1385
00:55:39.651 --> 00:55:44.651
<v Speaker 3>When these motherfuckers get power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all of a sudden they think that </v>

1386
00:55:44.651 --> 00:55:44.651
<v Speaker 3>their creative,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all of a sudden they want.</v>

1387
00:55:44.651 --> 00:55:46.580
<v Speaker 3>They want to influence the these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these funny people making their shit.</v>

1388
00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:51.700
<v Speaker 3>just because you've backed a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 3>movies and you've got a bunch of </v>

1389
00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:54.821
<v Speaker 3>successful movies under your belt,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't mean you know how to make </v>

1390
00:55:54.821 --> 00:55:57.731
<v Speaker 3>something funnier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they all just want to get their </v>

1391
00:55:57.731 --> 00:55:58.640
<v Speaker 3>greasy fingerprints on it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's a big problem in hollywood.</v>

1392
00:55:58.850 --> 00:56:02.240
<v Speaker 3>It's like no one lets like the smaller </v>
<v Speaker 3>the group,</v>

1393
00:56:02.241 --> 00:56:03.800
<v Speaker 3>the better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it's got to be.</v>

1394
00:56:03.801 --> 00:56:05.000
<v Speaker 3>The smaller the group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the better.</v>

1395
00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:07.880
<v Speaker 3>And you can't make what they're doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

1396
00:56:07.881 --> 00:56:09.000
<v Speaker 3>You can't go in and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1397
00:56:09.350 --> 00:56:11.240
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys are focusing too much on this.</v>

1398
00:56:11.241 --> 00:56:13.550
<v Speaker 3>It's too much that you've got to bring </v>
<v Speaker 3>it back and make it like you.</v>

1399
00:56:13.551 --> 00:56:16.040
<v Speaker 3>All you're going to do is cause chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All you're going to do is interrupt.</v>

1400
00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:18.620
<v Speaker 3>So either they make something that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>enjoy or they don't,</v>

1401
00:56:18.830 --> 00:56:22.000
<v Speaker 3>but you can't add to the process.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like saying if you were,</v>

1402
00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:24.460
<v Speaker 3>if someone was building car,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're making a porsche</v>

1403
00:56:24.730 --> 00:56:29.730
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the way this front end </v>

1404
00:56:29.730 --> 00:56:30.190
<v Speaker 1>looks what I want the front end to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stick up like this.</v>

1405
00:56:30.270 --> 00:56:32.140
<v Speaker 1>It's like a cobra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's coming at you.</v>

1406
00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:32.830
<v Speaker 1>And they'd go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

1407
00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:35.010
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because there's aero dynamics.</v>

1408
00:56:35.011 --> 00:56:36.880
<v Speaker 1>Like we need aerodynamics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He scientifically,</v>

1409
00:56:36.881 --> 00:56:38.650
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think it would really work.</v>

1410
00:56:38.651 --> 00:56:40.150
<v Speaker 1>We got to figure out a way to make this </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

1411
00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:41.020
<v Speaker 1>And he'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1412
00:56:41.021 --> 00:56:42.010
<v Speaker 1>did this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is stupid.</v>

1413
00:56:42.011 --> 00:56:47.011
<v Speaker 1>You're not a car designer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the same thing with these </v>

1414
00:56:47.011 --> 00:56:47.011
<v Speaker 1>assholes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not,</v>

1415
00:56:47.011 --> 00:56:47.470
<v Speaker 1>they're not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not actors,</v>

1416
00:56:47.471 --> 00:56:52.471
<v Speaker 1>they're not comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're just fucking people with money </v>

1417
00:56:52.471 --> 00:56:52.760
<v Speaker 1>that have financed a bunch of movies and</v>
<v Speaker 1>get it.</v>

1418
00:56:52.820 --> 00:56:54.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you're doing a tv show,</v>

1419
00:56:54.281 --> 00:56:56.140
<v Speaker 1>if you're doing a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a bunch of different people that</v>

1420
00:56:56.141 --> 00:56:57.250
<v Speaker 1>have their say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1421
00:56:57.251 --> 00:56:59.260
<v Speaker 1>that's how john travolta gets cast as </v>
<v Speaker 1>john gotti.</v>

1422
00:56:59.261 --> 00:57:02.050
<v Speaker 1>There's a bunch you know and you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at a guy like that.</v>

1423
00:57:02.051 --> 00:57:02.500
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

1424

1425
00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:05.080
<v Speaker 1>john travolta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regati.</v>

1426
00:57:05.350 --> 00:57:07.090
<v Speaker 1>It's very controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we should go with it.</v>

1427
00:57:07.210 --> 00:57:09.900
<v Speaker 1>It's going to get a lot of press.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John travolta's gotti.</v>

1428
00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:11.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:13.930
<v Speaker 1>meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back at the ranch,</v>

1430
00:57:13.931 --> 00:57:15.790
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you if we find the guy who </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrote that thing,</v>

1431
00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:17.560
<v Speaker 1>he's probably fucking pulling his hair </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

1432
00:57:17.620 --> 00:57:22.620
<v Speaker 7>John drove a whole dog freely.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The previous work of all time for john </v>

<v Speaker 7>You pop socket.</v>

1436
00:57:31.470 --> 00:57:33.070
<v Speaker 7>My life,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my family's life.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Not anymore.</v>

1439
00:57:39.400 --> 00:57:40.110
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1440
00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:42.390
<v Speaker 1>After this picture of the inquire of him</v>
<v Speaker 1>kissing another man.</v>

1441
00:57:43.500 --> 00:57:48.500
<v Speaker 1>Really interesting you say I'm getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>off as yet and there's a picture of him </v>

1442
00:57:49.200 --> 00:57:53.370
<v Speaker 1>kissing a bunch of people that know him </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he said it online that have said in</v>

1443
00:57:53.371 --> 00:57:56.550
<v Speaker 1>interviews that thought it was like out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was like,</v>

1444
00:57:56.610 --> 00:58:01.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a big article and like think </v>

1445
00:58:01.610 --> 00:58:01.610
<v Speaker 1>it was vanity fair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some,</v>

1446
00:58:01.610 --> 00:58:02.010
<v Speaker 1>some dude that drove walter used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bone,</v>

00:58:03.421 --> 00:58:06.930
<v Speaker 1>he would just go to bath houses and shit</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just hook up.</v>

1449
00:58:07.490 --> 00:58:09.980
<v Speaker 2>Remember the family guide with the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>family guy,</v>

1450
00:58:09.981 --> 00:58:13.700
<v Speaker 2>I think it was where it shows the Greece</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they fly out into the air,</v>

1451
00:58:14.220 --> 00:58:16.800
<v Speaker 2>like in the car and then it was like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1452
00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:21.820
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the bonus thing that they cut out the </v>

1453
00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:21.820
<v Speaker 2>movie where they're just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my god,</v>

1454
00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:22.010
<v Speaker 2>it's cold up here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's cool up here,</v>

1455
00:58:22.100 --> 00:58:27.100
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because they're just flying through the </v>

1456
00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:27.100
<v Speaker 2>sky and then she's like a warm me up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>warm me up.</v>

1458
00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:27.980

00:58:27.990 --> 00:58:29.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm good.</v>

1460
00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:31.650
<v Speaker 2>A gay joke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did your volt down?</v>

1461
00:58:31.651 --> 00:58:31.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1462
00:58:32.950 --> 00:58:34.630
<v Speaker 1>that's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1463
00:58:34.780 --> 00:58:35.250
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1464
00:58:35.251 --> 00:58:38.650
<v Speaker 1>I understand that if he was gay and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>not saying he is because I don't know,</v>

1465
00:58:39.440 --> 00:58:42.250
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if he was,</v>

1466
00:58:42.251 --> 00:58:44.950
<v Speaker 1>I totally understand them not wanting to</v>
<v Speaker 1>tell people because of his business.</v>

1467
00:58:45.370 --> 00:58:50.370
<v Speaker 1>You don't get to play the lead in movies</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they know you're gay because there's </v>

1468
00:58:50.370 --> 00:58:50.750
<v Speaker 1>just a big chunk of America like you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1469
00:58:50.770 --> 00:58:54.610
<v Speaker 1>fucking probably 30 or 40 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just not going to go see a movie</v>

1470
00:58:54.820 --> 00:58:58.330
<v Speaker 1>where john travolta is kissing girls and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has a girlfriend or a wife.</v>

1471
00:58:58.331 --> 00:58:59.740
<v Speaker 1>If you know that he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's gay,</v>

1472
00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:05.200
<v Speaker 2>don't you usually get to a certain point</v>
<v Speaker 2>in money at least or where you don't </v>

1473
00:59:05.241 --> 00:59:08.300
<v Speaker 2>need to worry about not getting lead </v>
<v Speaker 2>roles anymore.</v>

1474
00:59:08.310 --> 00:59:10.300
<v Speaker 2>You could still probably make money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1475
00:59:10.301 --> 00:59:15.301
<v Speaker 2>if.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially if you're gay to commercials </v>

1476
00:59:15.301 --> 00:59:15.301
<v Speaker 2>or that's easier said than done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

1477
00:59:15.301 --> 00:59:15.700
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a</v>

1478
00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:17.980
<v Speaker 1>lot of people don't want to disappoint </v>
<v Speaker 1>their fans.</v>

1479
00:59:18.550 --> 00:59:20.740
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people were worried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons why,</v>

1480
00:59:20.741 --> 00:59:25.741
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain alleged organizations protect </v>

1481
00:59:25.741 --> 00:59:26.450
<v Speaker 1>their members from homosexual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1482
00:59:26.451 --> 00:59:27.540
<v Speaker 1>rumors and all,</v>

<v Speaker 1>anybody finding out that they're gay,</v>

1484
00:59:29.570 --> 00:59:31.580
<v Speaker 1>it's because they're trying to protect </v>
<v Speaker 1>them as a business.</v>

1485
00:59:31.790 --> 00:59:35.570
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to use like a systematic </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach as a business to maximize their</v>

1486
00:59:35.571 --> 00:59:36.620
<v Speaker 1>opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

00:59:36.621 --> 00:59:38.750
<v Speaker 1>if you can come out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you do,</v>

1488
00:59:38.780 --> 00:59:40.400

<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

1489
00:59:40.401 --> 00:59:41.630
<v Speaker 1>you're only going to come out to </v>
<v Speaker 1>strangers.</v>

1613
01:04:14.501 --> 01:04:16.580
<v Speaker 1>they've completely abandoned it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's been kind of fascinating.</v>

1614
01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:21.910
<v Speaker 1>So they had some things happen to them </v>
<v Speaker 1>in their life and they just decided the </v>

1615
01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:21.910
<v Speaker 1>religion really doesn't make sense </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

1616
01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:23.630
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So weird wHen that happens,</v>

1617
01:04:23.631 --> 01:04:25.040
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when all of a sudden someone just goes,</v>

1618
01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:27.050
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was I doing?</v>

1619
01:04:27.590 --> 01:04:29.450
<v Speaker 1>Like I knew people that used to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>christians,</v>

1620
01:04:29.570 --> 01:04:33.770
<v Speaker 1>like we're super super christian and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they just kinda lightened up on it.</v>

1621
01:04:33.770 --> 01:04:38.770
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like rampage jackson at one point in </v>

1622
01:04:38.770 --> 01:04:38.770
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't swear,</v>

1623
01:04:38.770 --> 01:04:40.080
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't stop swearing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't want to have premarital sex.</v>

1624
01:04:40.081 --> 01:04:45.081
<v Speaker 1>So we got married,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the whole deal went super full </v>

1625
01:04:45.081 --> 01:04:45.081
<v Speaker 1>blown christian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was just the gIrl making them do</v>

1626
01:04:45.081 --> 01:04:45.440
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably.</v>

1627

<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>

1628
01:04:46.970 --> 01:04:49.100
<v Speaker 1>I think at some point in time people get</v>
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>

1629
01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:52.580
<v Speaker 1>real nervous and they really want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that there's an answer.</v>

1630
01:04:52.860 --> 01:04:54.050
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They really want to believe that someone</v>

1631
01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:57.350
<v Speaker 1>who's got a book from 3000 years ago </v>
<v Speaker 1>with all the shit in it,</v>

1632
01:04:57.351 --> 01:04:58.160
<v Speaker 1>it's all in here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1633
01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:03.340
<v Speaker 1>It's all in here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can live a perfect life and if </v>

1634
01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:03.340
<v Speaker 1>you're around people that really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>truly believe in,</v>

1635
01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:03.340
<v Speaker 1>here's the deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1636
01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:08.141
<v Speaker 1>It fucking works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were around someone who's a real </v>

1637
01:05:08.141 --> 01:05:08.141
<v Speaker 1>true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>practicing christian,</v>

1638
01:05:08.141 --> 01:05:10.010
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about what that is for a real,</v>

1639
01:05:10.011 --> 01:05:11.870
<v Speaker 1>true practicing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>practicing christian.</v>

1640
01:05:12.010 --> 01:05:15.680
<v Speaker 1>You are just doing christian things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to be loving and love your</v>

1641
01:05:15.681 --> 01:05:17.710
<v Speaker 1>neighbor and do charitable for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>

1642
01:05:17.711 --> 01:05:22.711
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really what it's supposed to be </v>

1643
01:05:22.711 --> 01:05:24.031
<v Speaker 1>all about and if you do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that really will make you a happier </v>

1644
01:05:24.031 --> 01:05:24.640
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it does work,</v>

1645
01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:26.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it's,</v>

1646
01:05:26.350 --> 01:05:31.350
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the reason why it works is because </v>

1647
01:05:31.350 --> 01:05:33.721
<v Speaker 1>you're tricking yourself into believing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this 2000 year old book written by </v>

1648
01:05:33.721 --> 01:05:35.050
<v Speaker 1>people thought the world was flat in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>son was 17 miles away,</v>

1649
01:05:35.051 --> 01:05:37.330
<v Speaker 1>has all the fucking answers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's ridiculous.</v>

1650
01:05:37.331 --> 01:05:38.570
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

1651
01:05:38.590 --> 01:05:40.360
<v Speaker 1>the fact that if you believe in </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

1652
01:05:40.361 --> 01:05:42.160
<v Speaker 1>it's like a placebo effect for your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like the chosen path.</v>

1657
01:05:51.430 --> 01:05:54.430

<v Speaker 2>It also gives you juice when you were </v>
<v Speaker 2>thirsty after killing dinosaurs.</v>

1740
01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:28.340
<v Speaker 2>But no,</v>

1745
01:09:36.941 --> 01:09:41.941
<v Speaker 2>have to be a way better actor than he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>capable of because these two guys were </v>

1746
01:09:41.941 --> 01:09:41.941
<v Speaker 2>so dominant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these debates and they're,</v>

1747

1779
01:11:14.191 --> 01:11:19.191
<v Speaker 1>years and just fucking continent killer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It kills almost everything on the </v>

1780
01:11:19.191 --> 01:11:22.200
<v Speaker 1>content killed like two thirds of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>living things on,</v>

1781
01:11:22.201 --> 01:11:24.030
<v Speaker 1>on north America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1782
01:11:24.031 --> 01:11:24.750
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>magma has been bulging and it's got </v>

1784
01:11:29.751 --> 01:11:33.771
<v Speaker 1>these bulging pocket swells where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>earth is lifting and there's all these </v>

1785
01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:39.080
<v Speaker 1>forms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these photos of them online and the </v>

1786
01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:39.080
<v Speaker 1>questions starting to freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When are we,</v>

1787
01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:40.350
<v Speaker 1>they don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll see.</v>

1788
01:11:40.351 --> 01:11:42.150
<v Speaker 1>It's been about 600,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

1789
01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:43.680
<v Speaker 1>So it could,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really could happen.</v>

1790
01:11:43.681 --> 01:11:45.300
<v Speaker 1>They're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were concerned.</v>

1791
01:11:45.301 --> 01:11:47.010
<v Speaker 1>They said they were concerned for </v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile,</v>

1792
01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:52.160
<v Speaker 1>but then they're not now they're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore because it stopped doing what </v>

1793
01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:56.061
<v Speaker 1>they were worried it could do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the bottom line is it's completely </v>

1794
01:11:56.061 --> 01:11:56.450
<v Speaker 1>unpredictable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know what,</v>

1795
01:11:56.460 --> 01:12:01.460
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it can happen or why it happens or </v>

1796
01:12:01.460 --> 01:12:01.560
<v Speaker 1>what causes it when they say it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>contract killer,</v>

1797
01:12:01.561 --> 01:12:03.240
<v Speaker 1>like I could destroy the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>continent.</v>

1798
01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:06.420
<v Speaker 1>Is that like maximum?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the minimum is like,</v>

1799
01:12:06.450 --> 01:12:11.450
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it will ruin like the taco bell next </v>

1800
01:12:11.450 --> 01:12:11.450
<v Speaker 1>door,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1801
01:12:11.450 --> 01:12:11.450
<v Speaker 1>Well this is what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

1802
01:12:11.450 --> 01:12:15.830
<v Speaker 1>It's 300 kilometers wide and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>super volcano,</v>

1803
01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:17.730
<v Speaker 1>which means when it blows up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1804
01:12:17.770 --> 01:12:20.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mount saint helens is a volcano and then</v>

1805
01:12:20.431 --> 01:12:25.431
<v Speaker 1>at the top there was a small area where </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the water was shooting up in the </v>

1806
01:12:25.431 --> 01:12:28.491
<v Speaker 1>air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well this isn't like that with this is </v>

1807
01:12:28.491 --> 01:12:31.250
<v Speaker 1>like the top part,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the top part is a 160 miles wide and</v>

1808
01:12:32.251 --> 01:12:36.650
<v Speaker 1>it shoots straight up in the air like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking mile high wall of love,</v>

1809
01:12:36.660 --> 01:12:38.040
<v Speaker 1>agitate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then steve.</v>

1810
01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:43.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then nuclear winter occurs because </v>

1811
01:12:43.070 --> 01:12:44.100
<v Speaker 1>the entire surface of the earth gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>covered in fucking ash.</v>

1812
01:12:44.250 --> 01:12:49.250
<v Speaker 1>Like no planes can fly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that little tiny baby as </v>

1813
01:12:49.250 --> 01:12:50.190
<v Speaker 1>volcanic blew up in Iceland and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody got fucked.</v>

1814
01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:53.220
<v Speaker 1>Nobody can even fly anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when this one blows,</v>

1815
01:12:53.290 --> 01:12:57.750
<v Speaker 1>it's they do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like take the drill holes in it.</v>

1816
01:12:59.830 --> 01:13:00.240
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1817
01:13:00.241 --> 01:13:01.440
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is way too big.</v>

1818
01:13:01.441 --> 01:13:02.840
<v Speaker 1>You got to move to Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bitch,</v>

1819
01:13:03.290 --> 01:13:05.690
<v Speaker 1>move to Australia and have some canned </v>
<v Speaker 1>food waiting.</v>

1820
01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:08.550
<v Speaker 1>Seriously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that motherfucker goes,</v>

1821
01:13:08.551 --> 01:13:11.190
<v Speaker 1>if that mother fucker goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to go.</v>

1822
01:13:11.590 --> 01:13:13.470
<v Speaker 1>You probably won't be able to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

1823
01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:14.850
<v Speaker 1>You probably won't be able to get out in</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1824
01:13:14.880 --> 01:13:17.490
<v Speaker 1>If we find out tomorrow that yellowstone</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to blow.</v>

1825
01:13:17.610 --> 01:13:19.740
<v Speaker 1>What are we gonna do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are we going to go to san diego?</v>

1826
01:13:19.770 --> 01:13:23.300
<v Speaker 1>That's why I keep that in my car job,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my my emergency kit at all.</v>

1827
01:13:23.790 --> 01:13:27.700
<v Speaker 1>I hope that thing has a motor boat and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to get the fuck put</v>

1828
01:13:27.890 --> 01:13:32.890
<v Speaker 1>in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a good idea to get one of those </v>

1829
01:13:32.890 --> 01:13:32.890
<v Speaker 1>rafts blowup raffing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

1830
01:13:32.890 --> 01:13:33.800
<v Speaker 1>Because you know in Australia when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was fucking when,</v>

1831
01:13:33.801 --> 01:13:36.900
<v Speaker 1>when these crazy floods hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were sharks in the street.</v>

1832
01:13:37.530 --> 01:13:39.450
<v Speaker 1>Sharks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>people spotted sharks.</v>

1833
01:13:39.451 --> 01:13:41.880
<v Speaker 1>Bull sharks swimming down the street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how much water.</v>

1834
01:13:41.881 --> 01:13:46.881
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't Australia bringing guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New molten lava was just coming and </v>

1835
01:13:47.221 --> 01:13:49.630
<v Speaker 1>there is no escape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You kill yourself.</v>

1836
01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:51.140
<v Speaker 1>It's not even that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

1837
01:13:51.150 --> 01:13:52.890
<v Speaker 1>The molten lava was goIng to fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1838
01:13:52.891 --> 01:13:54.570
<v Speaker 1>that's bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lab is terrible,</v>

1839
01:13:54.690 --> 01:13:58.050
<v Speaker 1>but when it's all the other stuff that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get you to the toxic rain,</v>

1840
01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:01.830
<v Speaker 1>the fucking shit and the air wick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it fills your lungs up and kills you.</v>

1841
01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:06.970
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they found all these woolly </v>

1842
01:14:06.970 --> 01:14:09.150
<v Speaker 1>mammoths and they were all dead and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were dead in like this mask,</v>

1843
01:14:09.210 --> 01:14:14.210
<v Speaker 1>like field of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things they found was </v>

1844
01:14:14.210 --> 01:14:14.250
<v Speaker 1>that their lungs were all filled with </v>
<v Speaker 1>like sit.</v>

<v Speaker 1>ash.</v>

1846
01:14:17.650 --> 01:14:22.650
<v Speaker 1>And so what happened was they just got </v>
<v Speaker 1>caught in some big volcano eruption and </v>

1847
01:14:22.650 --> 01:14:24.460

<v Speaker 1>That's what they used to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1878
01:15:27.460 --> 01:15:29.190
<v Speaker 1>In Hawaii,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are douche bags.</v>

01:15:29.191 --> 01:15:32.340
<v Speaker 1>They throw him in fucking palae they </v>
<v Speaker 1>throw in a volcano man,</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's how they execute them back in the</v>

1883
01:15:38.730 --> 01:15:42.600
<v Speaker 1>day sun back when motherfuckers wearing </v>

<v Speaker 1>throwing people in a volcano.</v>

1887
01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:58.880
<v Speaker 1>There was a documentary on the lost </v>
<v Speaker 1>tribes and all these different people </v>

<v Speaker 1>sudden you're making bows and arrows out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of bamboo trees and making your own </v>

<v Speaker 1>need to sustain a population.</v>

1906
01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:44.650
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>yourself.</v>

1932
01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:41.940
<v Speaker 1>You gotta try to figure out a way to </v>

<v Speaker 1>this is what they're saying is that </v>

1946
01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:13.631
<v Speaker 1>there's chemicals that are sold as bath </v>
<v Speaker 1>salts and people are taking these and </v>

1947
01:18:13.631 --> 01:18:18.170
<v Speaker 1>again high with them and it's making </v>
<v Speaker 1>people like crazy suicidal,</v>

1948
01:18:18.171 --> 01:18:23.171
<v Speaker 1>do a nutty shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's one guy took a skinning </v>

1949
01:18:23.171 --> 01:18:25.661
<v Speaker 1>knife,</v>

1950
01:18:25.661 --> 01:18:25.661
<v Speaker 1>repeatedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He survived,</v>

1951
01:18:25.730 --> 01:18:30.730
<v Speaker 1>but other people haven't been lucky as </v>
<v Speaker 1>was snorting or injecting and snorting </v>

1952
01:18:30.730 --> 01:18:34.880

<v Speaker 1>as ivory wave read,</v>

1953
01:18:34.881 --> 01:18:39.881
<v Speaker 1>dove and vanilla sky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it basically turns you into some </v>

<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

1981
01:19:46.121 --> 01:19:46.730
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they do it and they watched </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ufc,</v>

1983
01:19:51.731 --> 01:19:52.310
<v Speaker 1>while the fights are going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these comics are commentating on it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was not like the promise.</v>

1989
01:20:07.650 --> 01:20:08.010
<v Speaker 1>We've done</v>

1990
01:20:08.010 --> 01:20:13.010
<v Speaker 2>two of that blackout cast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is where we take a whole bottle </v>

1991
01:20:13.010 --> 01:20:14.640
<v Speaker 2>and we start going crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First one was the jaeger might've jaeger</v>

1992
01:20:14.690 --> 01:20:18.990
<v Speaker 2>meister bottle and we did that in like </v>
<v Speaker 2>an hour and then don't remember the last</v>

1993
01:20:18.990 --> 01:20:21.450
<v Speaker 2>half of it to remember the next day for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first couple of hours,</v>

1994
01:20:21.810 --> 01:20:23.730

<v Speaker 2>I don't remember anything.</v>

1995
01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:26.730
<v Speaker 2>Then the second one we didn't feel like </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you watch the video,</v>

1996
01:20:28.050 --> 01:20:30.770
<v Speaker 2>that one was funny because it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1997
01:20:30.890 --> 01:20:32.760
<v Speaker 2>But the last one was so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You took it down.</v>

1998
01:20:32.780 --> 01:20:33.540
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1999
01:20:33.541 --> 01:20:35.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm debating on it because the problem </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

2000
01:20:35.461 --> 01:20:40.240
<v Speaker 2>is the ufc drunk casts was right before </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and we got sloshed on the drunk cast,</v>

2001
01:20:40.241 --> 01:20:42.550
<v Speaker 2>like we wasted at the end of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last one.</v>

2003
01:20:43.830 --> 01:20:44.610
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2004
01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:46.920
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we decided like an hour later,</v>

<v Speaker 2>we couldn't even think of what to drink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're drinking coconut water with </v>

<v Speaker 4>playing on and then get it to a certain </v>

2039
01:22:12.010 --> 01:22:13.510
<v Speaker 4>point where it's like,</v>

01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:24.510
<v Speaker 4>Should I puke now or should I?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can I hold it in or can I get to the </v>

2042
01:22:24.510 --> 01:22:24.730
<v Speaker 4>bathroom?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Keeping on camera.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I tried.</v>

2044
01:22:25.331 --> 01:22:30.331
<v Speaker 4>There was a part where I get a bag in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>bag and then she ended up puking you and</v>

2045
01:22:30.491 --> 01:22:33.370
<v Speaker 4>you ended up licking his fleshlight you </v>
<v Speaker 4>should've thrown out.</v>

2050
01:22:43.030 --> 01:22:48.030
<v Speaker 4>I think the secret is starting off </v>
<v Speaker 4>completely sober and then drinking a </v>

2051
01:22:48.030 --> 01:22:51.961
<v Speaker 4>whole bottle in an hour or something.</v>

2059
01:23:11.170 --> 01:23:12.550
<v Speaker 2>but the bottom line is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2060
01:23:12.551 --> 01:23:14.800
<v Speaker 2>it's like shaking hands with a dude.</v>

2061
01:23:14.850 --> 01:23:19.850
<v Speaker 3>If you shake hands with the dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're basically touching his dick </v>

2062
01:23:19.850 --> 01:23:22.011
<v Speaker 3>because every guy touched his dick and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the odds of him having washed his hands </v>

2063
01:23:22.011 --> 01:23:23.310
<v Speaker 3>after he touched his dick before he </v>
<v Speaker 3>touches your hands,</v>

2064
01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:26.220
<v Speaker 3>they're like 70 percent against most of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the times.</v>

2065
01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:27.600
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you're not around,</v>

2066
01:23:27.730 --> 01:23:30.960
<v Speaker 3>we were always grabbing our dicks and </v>
<v Speaker 3>moving it around or grabbing our balls.</v>

2067
01:23:30.961 --> 01:23:33.510
<v Speaker 3>Like you shake your hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're touching his balls.</v>

2068
01:23:33.780 --> 01:23:35.860
<v Speaker 2>There's one point in the drunk cat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So which,</v>

2069
01:23:35.861 --> 01:23:36.190
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2070
01:23:36.250 --> 01:23:37.140
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

2071
01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:38.180
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is true.</v>

2072
01:23:38.190 --> 01:23:39.720
<v Speaker 2>We kiss a girl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're sucking someone's deck.</v>

2073
01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:42.090
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I ever told you this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a true story,</v>

2074
01:23:42.091 --> 01:23:43.380
<v Speaker 2>a crazy story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

2075
01:23:43.381 --> 01:23:48.381
<v Speaker 2>so I used to work at this mexican </v>
<v Speaker 2>restaurant and I was a waiter and the </v>

2076
01:23:48.381 --> 01:23:49.110
<v Speaker 2>waitresses were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was 1:18</v>

2077
01:23:49.111 --> 01:23:51.960
<v Speaker 2>year old waitress,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like three slash 17 year old waitresses.</v>

2078
01:23:52.230 --> 01:23:55.290
<v Speaker 2>They're all fucking hot and they all had</v>
<v Speaker 2>a crush on me.</v>

2079
01:23:55.350 --> 01:23:58.320
<v Speaker 2>It's important of music.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so anyways,</v>

2080
01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:03.480
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started having sex with the 18 year </v>

2081
01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:05.781
<v Speaker 2>old hostess player back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She had a party once.</v>

2082
01:24:06.001 --> 01:24:07.720
<v Speaker 2>Where did she invited all the hostesses </v>
<v Speaker 2>and was.</v>

2083
01:24:07.740 --> 01:24:08.790
<v Speaker 2>So it was me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>her,</v>

2084
01:24:08.791 --> 01:24:12.060
<v Speaker 2>and like three other hostesses were all </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting wasted drinking.</v>

2085
01:24:12.061 --> 01:24:14.190
<v Speaker 2>I bought them alcohol because that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>what I like to do.</v>

2086
01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:16.370
<v Speaker 2>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2087
01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:18.360
<v Speaker 2>the party starters here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

2088
01:24:18.361 --> 01:24:21.660
<v Speaker 2>how can I make out with all these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take advantage of all these girls at the</v>

2089
01:24:21.661 --> 01:24:22.320
<v Speaker 2>same time?</v>

2090
01:24:22.650 --> 01:24:27.650
<v Speaker 2>And so I thought up this idea where I </v>
<v Speaker 2>took saran wrap and I would put it in </v>

2091
01:24:27.650 --> 01:24:29.250
<v Speaker 2>between my mouth and the girl's mouth </v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

2092
01:24:29.310 --> 01:24:34.310
<v Speaker 2>if you want to make out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not touching me so we can pretty </v>

2093
01:24:34.310 --> 01:24:35.520
<v Speaker 2>much make out as much as you want and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll feel real.</v>

2094
01:24:35.700 --> 01:24:36.450
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>holy shit,</v>

2095
01:24:36.451 --> 01:24:41.451
<v Speaker 2>that's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I would just start making out </v>

2096
01:24:41.451 --> 01:24:43.930
<v Speaker 2>old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were you when I was 18 and they were 18 </v>

2097
01:24:43.930 --> 01:24:44.710
<v Speaker 2>and they fell for this 13 year old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2098
01:24:44.870 --> 01:24:45.290
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2099
01:24:45.570 --> 01:24:46.890
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was great.</v>

2100
01:24:46.891 --> 01:24:51.891
<v Speaker 2>It's like I would on a couple of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>girls that had a little hole in the </v>

2101
01:24:51.891 --> 01:24:53.100
<v Speaker 2>thing that I find my tongue and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't have noticed because it felt it</v>

2102
01:24:53.101 --> 01:24:55.650
<v Speaker 2>feels real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I started taking saran wrap and</v>

2103
01:24:55.651 --> 01:25:00.651
<v Speaker 2>putting on my hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like I can touch your boobs because </v>

2104
01:25:00.651 --> 01:25:00.660
<v Speaker 2>I'm not actually touching a serial </v>
<v Speaker 2>killer.</v>

2105
01:25:02.070 --> 01:25:03.960
<v Speaker 2>And this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a good move.</v>

2106
01:25:03.961 --> 01:25:05.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I did that.</v>

2107
01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:09.420
<v Speaker 2>We were so drunk I started getting mad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So tell me more about this move.</v>

2108
01:25:09.421 --> 01:25:11.070
<v Speaker 2>So the girls let you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2109
01:25:11.071 --> 01:25:12.960
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of them.</v>

2110
01:25:12.961 --> 01:25:17.961
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was up the shirt making out and this </v>

2111
01:25:17.961 --> 01:25:18.660
<v Speaker 2>shirt and they were drawn to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just have.</v>

2112
01:25:18.750 --> 01:25:23.670
<v Speaker 2>And what was so funny is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that the girls could feel,</v>

2113
01:25:23.671 --> 01:25:25.500
<v Speaker 2>when I put my hand up with the plastic </v>
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

2114
01:25:25.690 --> 01:25:30.690
<v Speaker 2>like it was like not like half,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the saran wrap wasn't covering my </v>

2115
01:25:30.690 --> 01:25:31.170
<v Speaker 2>hand half the time to do that and it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

2116
01:25:31.171 --> 01:25:33.000
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this move is awesome.</v>

2117
01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:38.760
<v Speaker 2>Wild julian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Julian assange is in jail for rape for </v>

2118
01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:38.760
<v Speaker 2>way less than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2119
01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:41.400
<v Speaker 2>And so then then the one girl I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking with,</v>

2120
01:25:41.430 --> 01:25:44.460
<v Speaker 2>like I went and had sex with her and </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever that later that night,</v>

2121
01:25:44.750 --> 01:25:49.750
<v Speaker 2>and they all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the other girls like passed out in the </v>

2122
01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:51.591
<v Speaker 2>living room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came out and this one girl was like </v>

2123
01:25:51.591 --> 01:25:51.591
<v Speaker 2>still awake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>horny.</v>

2124
01:25:51.591 --> 01:25:54.531
<v Speaker 2>And she called me over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He started making out and we had sex in </v>

2125
01:25:54.531 --> 01:25:55.410
<v Speaker 2>there and then it led to sex even.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

2126
01:25:55.520 --> 01:26:00.520
<v Speaker 3>So you think you started a competition </v>
<v Speaker 3>by filling up all these girls and being </v>

2127
01:26:01.131 --> 01:26:02.320
<v Speaker 3>the only male,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2128
01:26:02.450 --> 01:26:03.860
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you started a competition,</v>

2129
01:26:03.861 --> 01:26:04.110
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2130
01:26:04.130 --> 01:26:07.160
<v Speaker 4>You created an unfair game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a very smart move.</v>

2131
01:26:07.210 --> 01:26:09.830
<v Speaker 4>It was very similar to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The pound was strong.</v>

2132
01:26:09.831 --> 01:26:14.831
<v Speaker 4>So I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I pulled them out on allison and feel </v>

2133
01:26:14.831 --> 01:26:14.831
<v Speaker 4>real.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It feels real,</v>

2134
01:26:14.831 --> 01:26:15.560
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it felt completely real.</v>

2135
01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:19.880
<v Speaker 4>Pulled them little young kids out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

2136
01:26:19.881 --> 01:26:20.870
<v Speaker 4>I'll use saran wrap.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

2137
01:26:20.871 --> 01:26:23.450
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so why don't you use condoms?</v>

2138
01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:28.600
<v Speaker 4>You don't even really fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what you're pretty much doing </v>

2139
01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:29.660
<v Speaker 4>face condoms and condoms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2140
01:26:29.690 --> 01:26:30.650
<v Speaker 4>Pitch that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The trojan.</v>

2141
01:26:30.710 --> 01:26:32.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you had a really strong plastic,</v>

2142
01:26:32.930 --> 01:26:37.930
<v Speaker 4>like really strong one and you could put</v>
<v Speaker 4>your whole body and cover your entire </v>

2143
01:26:37.930 --> 01:26:38.940
<v Speaker 4>body in this sheet of plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

2144
01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:39.800
<v Speaker 4>Let's try it out.</v>

<v Speaker 4>there and hangs out.</v>

2150

01:39:15.560 --> 01:39:20.560
<v Speaker 4>I'll try to recreate what it used to be </v>
<v Speaker 4>like back in the day when I started out </v>

2429
01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:22.460
<v Speaker 4>in the comedy because I was mad and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>could just go into a smoky room when you</v>

2430
01:39:22.461 --> 01:39:24.700
<v Speaker 4>knew that just dark shit was gonna </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen</v>

2431
01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:27.750
<v Speaker 3>about those smoky rooms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

<v Speaker 3>where you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just knew.</v>

2433
01:39:29.790 --> 01:39:31.260
<v Speaker 3>No one's taking care of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're healthier,</v>

2434
01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:31.670
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is,</v>

2435
01:39:31.790 --> 01:39:33.420
<v Speaker 3>this is a place of deviance.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

2436
01:39:33.720 --> 01:39:38.720
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why I used to love smokey pool </v>

2437
01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:38.720
<v Speaker 3>halls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pool balls used to be the best.</v>

2438
01:39:38.720 --> 01:39:38.850
<v Speaker 3>He'd go In to clock in the morning,</v>

2439
01:39:39.210 --> 01:39:41.970
<v Speaker 4>packed in a thick cloud of cigarette </v>
<v Speaker 4>smoke.</v>

2440
01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.410
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's probably not so good for you,</v>

2441
01:39:43.411 --> 01:39:45.380
<v Speaker 4>but something about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just got the worst.</v>

2442
01:39:45.381 --> 01:39:47.970
<v Speaker 4>Is waking up the next day though in </v>
<v Speaker 4>smelling your clothes.</v>

2443
01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:51.030
<v Speaker 4>Oh god.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even as a smoker that.</v>

2444
01:39:51.060 --> 01:39:52.350
<v Speaker 4>That's disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2445
01:39:52.410 --> 01:39:54.840
<v Speaker 4>They stIll have one of those in orange </v>
<v Speaker 4>county near where I live,</v>

2446
01:39:54.940 --> 01:39:56.790
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to bar with the pool tables and stuff.</v>

2447
01:39:56.791 --> 01:39:58.080
<v Speaker 4>And you could smoke cigarettes inside.</v>

2448
01:39:58.330 --> 01:40:03.330
<v Speaker 3>I was having this conversation with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>buddy of mine about those natural </v>

2449
01:40:03.330 --> 01:40:03.820
<v Speaker 3>cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Are those things any better for you?</v>

2450
01:40:04.090 --> 01:40:09.090
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like vapor and there's like no </v>

2451
01:40:09.090 --> 01:40:10.070
<v Speaker 4>carcinogens in it or something like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>little bit,</v>

2452
01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:11.780
<v Speaker 4>but it's still tobacco,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2453
01:40:11.890 --> 01:40:13.460
<v Speaker 4>Smoking tobacco is not good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2454
01:40:13.461 --> 01:40:14.680
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no smoke.</v>

2455
01:40:14.770 --> 01:40:16.270
<v Speaker 4>That's correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of like,</v>

2456
01:40:16.271 --> 01:40:17.860
<v Speaker 4>what are you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm talking about cigarettes,</v>

2457
01:40:18.460 --> 01:40:22.210
<v Speaker 4>electronic cigarettes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cigarettes.</v>

2458
01:40:22.211 --> 01:40:23.620
<v Speaker 4>I said natural,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like those,</v>

2459
01:40:23.621 --> 01:40:28.621
<v Speaker 4>those american spirits things like are </v>
<v Speaker 4>those better for you or better for you </v>

2460
01:40:28.621 --> 01:40:30.590
<v Speaker 4>because it doesn't have like 102 other </v>
<v Speaker 4>chemicals in it and.</v>

2461
01:40:31.380 --> 01:40:31.770
<v Speaker 4>YeaH.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2462
01:40:32.050 --> 01:40:37.050
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's better for you than having a </v>

2463
01:40:37.050 --> 01:40:37.050
<v Speaker 4>marlboro light.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>

2464
01:40:37.050 --> 01:40:37.870
<v Speaker 4>but I also have noticed when I smoke </v>
<v Speaker 4>those,</v>

2465
01:40:37.871 --> 01:40:39.850
<v Speaker 4>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it takes forever.</v>

2466
01:40:39.851 --> 01:40:43.150
<v Speaker 4>Like it's like two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like I'm smoking 20 minutes instead</v>

2467
01:40:43.151 --> 01:40:44.670
<v Speaker 4>of five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2468
01:40:44.671 --> 01:40:47.380
<v Speaker 4>it's like a bonfire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just not the same.</v>

2469
01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:50.620
<v Speaker 4>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like it,</v>

2470
01:40:50.621 --> 01:40:52.050
<v Speaker 4>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it feels like you're,</v>

2471
01:40:52.240 --> 01:40:53.980
<v Speaker 4>you're smoking more bonfire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's</v>

2472
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:56.620
<v Speaker 1>an Interesting way of describing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when you get smoke in your mouth,</v>

2473
01:40:56.621 --> 01:41:01.621
<v Speaker 1>when you're near a fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you cough on it tastes nasty </v>

2474
01:41:01.621 --> 01:41:02.170
<v Speaker 1>leafy and drive like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ooh,</v>

2475
01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:04.980
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't sound good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me go old bites.</v>

2476
01:41:05.020 --> 01:41:08.170
<v Speaker 1>He barely even feel like you're smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2477
01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:12.100
<v Speaker 1>It just feels calming or something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't mind tobacco man.</v>

2478
01:41:12.130 --> 01:41:14.890
<v Speaker 1>I liked tobacco in the form of cigars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tobacco,</v>

2479
01:41:14.891 --> 01:41:19.891
<v Speaker 1>When you smoke a big cigar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like especially if they have like a big </v>

2480
01:41:19.891 --> 01:41:21.400
<v Speaker 1>meal and have a big cigar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so garza gives you like a weird buzz man</v>

2481
01:41:21.430 --> 01:41:24.900
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to pipe what's her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you're not in like inhaling Mr.</v>

2482

<v Speaker 1>For sure.</v>

2485
01:41:26.980 --> 01:41:29.180

<v Speaker 1>dry,</v>

2486

2488
01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:33.160
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people don't know that,</v>

2489
01:41:33.161 --> 01:41:34.990
<v Speaker 1>but like anytime there's smoke in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mouth,</v>

2490
01:41:34.991 --> 01:41:36.810
<v Speaker 1>it's almost immediately in your blood </v>
<v Speaker 1>sweat.</v>

2491
01:41:36.820 --> 01:41:39.550
<v Speaker 1>That's when people say like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to inhale this weed.</v>

<v Speaker 1>slash your face off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2522
01:42:46.031 --> 01:42:48.310
<v Speaker 1>They're still conscious and alive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>causes.</v>

01:42:59.261 --> 01:43:04.261
<v Speaker 1>in the lab and there aren't regulated </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're not marketed for human </v>

2527
01:43:04.261 --> 01:43:05.770
<v Speaker 1>consumption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these things are in these bath salts.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it gets in there and washes around.</v>

2534
01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:29.820
<v Speaker 1>It causes intense cravings for it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll binge on it for three to four </v>

2535
01:43:29.820 --> 01:43:32.320
<v Speaker 1>days before they show up in an er and </v>

<v Speaker 1>figured out that they get smart.</v>

2549
01:44:11.990 --> 01:44:14.420
<v Speaker 1>It's almost like you found another hole </v>

2554
01:44:25.870 --> 01:44:25.870
<v Speaker 1>recreational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like you're going to try to.</v>

2555
01:44:25.870 --> 01:44:30.431
<v Speaker 1>I didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'd do it and you get a face slash and </v>

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2558
01:44:33.380 --> 01:44:38.380
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if you could just do a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit less of it and not turn into a face </v>

2559
01:44:38.380 --> 01:44:39.040
<v Speaker 1>slash name is already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're just doing way too much.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoa,</v>

01:44:40.641 --> 01:44:42.620
<v Speaker 1>here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what they're saying.</v>

2562
01:44:42.621 --> 01:44:47.621
<v Speaker 1>The problem grew in rural Mississippi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After a law began restricting the sale </v>

2563
01:44:49.130 --> 01:44:51.710
<v Speaker 1>of pseudo f,</v>
<v Speaker 1>f a dream,</v>

2564
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:56.830
<v Speaker 1>the key ingredient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and making methamphetamine </v>

2565
01:44:56.830 --> 01:44:56.830
<v Speaker 1>pseudoephedrine pseudoephedrine.</v>

2566
01:44:56.830 --> 01:45:00.350
<v Speaker 1>So when they stopped selling that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're restricting the sale of it.</v>

2567
01:45:00.351 --> 01:45:05.351
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't get meth anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they got crazy and then they tried </v>

2568
01:45:05.351 --> 01:45:05.870
<v Speaker 1>this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is worse than math.</v>

2569
01:45:07.130 --> 01:45:09.380
<v Speaker 1>This is something that's fucking up meth</v>
<v Speaker 1>heads.</v>

2570
01:45:09.650 --> 01:45:14.650
<v Speaker 1>Like they used to just be meth heads and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they started doing bass to cutting </v>

2571
01:45:14.650 --> 01:45:18.401
<v Speaker 1>their faces off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to hear about the kids who tried </v>

2572
01:45:18.401 --> 01:45:18.401
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who started this phenomenon.</v>

2573
01:45:18.401 --> 01:45:20.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it was the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2574
01:45:20.670 --> 01:45:23.750
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't kids really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Governor happened.</v>

2575
01:45:23.840 --> 01:45:26.660
<v Speaker 1>I bet there was some fucking crazy guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>like in that breaking bad show.</v>

2576
01:45:26.690 --> 01:45:27.330
<v Speaker 1>There was some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>

2577
01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:32.360
<v Speaker 1>some sort of a scientist character and </v>
<v Speaker 1>he realized that bath salts will fuck </v>

2578
01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:33.440
<v Speaker 1>you up to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just started giving them to people.</v>

2579
01:45:34.060 --> 01:45:35.900
<v Speaker 1>That's possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't even corner that market if</v>

2580
01:45:35.901 --> 01:45:40.901
<v Speaker 1>you tell them it's bath salts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they must have held at gunpoint to </v>

2581
01:45:40.901 --> 01:45:44.111
<v Speaker 1>get the secret sauce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the greatest fucking crack of </v>

2582
01:45:44.111 --> 01:45:44.111
<v Speaker 1>all time,</v>

<v Speaker 2>things for christmas where it was like a</v>
<v Speaker 2>bag of bath salts,</v>

2587
01:45:53.231 --> 01:45:58.231
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like a decorative item given to </v>

<v Speaker 5>she told me that she has this friend who</v>

2629
01:47:36.750 --> 01:47:39.660
<v Speaker 5>obviously went crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>moved away to a different state,</v>

2630
01:47:39.690 --> 01:47:44.690
<v Speaker 5>but she got pulled over by the cops and </v>
<v Speaker 5>had a whole vial of acid on her and she </v>

2631
01:47:44.690 --> 01:47:47.880
<v Speaker 5>drank.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She tripped for like 60 days and fucking</v>

2632
01:47:47.881 --> 01:47:50.610
<v Speaker 5>like split town and like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's been a weirdo ever since.</v>

2633
01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:52.380
<v Speaker 5>I never met the girl.</v>
<v Speaker 5>God,</v>

2634
01:47:54.930 --> 01:47:58.470
<v Speaker 5>why don't you just pour it on the ground</v>
<v Speaker 5>are ridiculous.</v>

2635
01:47:59.600 --> 01:47:59.940
<v Speaker 5>Or just</v>

2636
01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:00.950
<v Speaker 1>start going doon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doon,</v>

2637
01:48:00.960 --> 01:48:05.520
<v Speaker 1>doon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doon gould who do come to life.</v>

2638
01:48:05.521 --> 01:48:08.630
<v Speaker 1>It becomes a transformer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2639
01:48:08.631 --> 01:48:13.631
<v Speaker 1>I've heard stories about people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the number one drug that I've </v>

2640
01:48:13.631 --> 01:48:13.631
<v Speaker 1>heard stories about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People losing their shit on.</v>

2641
01:48:13.631 --> 01:48:14.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just breaking,</v>

2642
01:48:14.890 --> 01:48:16.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just see,</v>

2643
01:48:16.020 --> 01:48:20.000
<v Speaker 1>you broke it broke it I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think acid in any,</v>

2644
01:48:20.001 --> 01:48:23.900
<v Speaker 1>like any secondary given dmt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think if you do it a certain amount of</v>

2645
01:48:23.901 --> 01:48:25.400
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're probably not going to be the same</v>

2646
01:48:25.401 --> 01:48:30.401
<v Speaker 1>as before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew what do to did it 100 times and </v>

2647
01:48:30.401 --> 01:48:32.711
<v Speaker 1>he totally became crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just was doing dmt all the time to </v>

2648
01:48:32.711 --> 01:48:34.910
<v Speaker 1>the point where when he would do dmt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dmt entities would talk to him and go,</v>

2649
01:48:34.911 --> 01:48:35.370
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

2650
01:48:35.371 --> 01:48:38.540
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you get to stop coming here to settle</v>

2651
01:48:38.541 --> 01:48:41.290
<v Speaker 1>the fuck down and killing our bus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dmt.</v>

2652
01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:46.360
<v Speaker 1>And when you have a dmt experience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of it is marked by </v>

2653
01:48:46.360 --> 01:48:47.150
<v Speaker 1>communication with whatever the fuck it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

2654
01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:52.420
<v Speaker 1>You could be that you're communicating </v>
<v Speaker 1>with some other part of your </v>

2655
01:48:52.420 --> 01:48:52.420
<v Speaker 1>consciousness that you don't normally </v>
<v Speaker 1>have access to.</v>

2656
01:48:52.420 --> 01:48:56.270
<v Speaker 1>Or it could be the great beyond like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this well of souls or it could be aliens</v>

2657
01:48:56.271 --> 01:48:58.310
<v Speaker 1>and another dimension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're communicating with something.</v>

2658
01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:00.080
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is is really just </v>
<v Speaker 1>speculative.</v>

2659
01:49:00.530 --> 01:49:02.570
<v Speaker 1>But this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he would go over there,</v>

2660
01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:04.430
<v Speaker 1>the dmt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever he was connecting to,</v>

2661
01:49:04.431 --> 01:49:04.970
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude?</v>

2662
01:49:04.971 --> 01:49:05.330
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Bmp everyday.</v>

2665
01:49:08.240 --> 01:49:13.240
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the dmt spirits are actually </v>

2666
01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:13.240
<v Speaker 1>annoyed with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Come on dude,</v>

<v Speaker 1>your stinky feet or on my couch the fuck</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's funny.</v>

2670
01:49:23.660 --> 01:49:24.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2671
01:49:24.611 --> 01:49:29.611
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until they figure out a way to let </v>

2672
01:49:29.611 --> 01:49:30.530
<v Speaker 1>people do whatever the fuck they want </v>
<v Speaker 1>with their bodies.</v>

2673
01:49:30.620 --> 01:49:35.620
<v Speaker 1>Do whatever the fuck you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to always have a gang of </v>

2674
01:49:35.620 --> 01:49:38.821
<v Speaker 1>different drug problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where people are afraid of though is </v>

2675
01:49:38.821 --> 01:49:39.380
<v Speaker 1>that when you start making everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>legal,</v>

2676
01:49:39.470 --> 01:49:41.840
<v Speaker 1>well then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll put kid could get a hold of it and</v>

2677
01:49:41.841 --> 01:49:44.600
<v Speaker 1>everyone could get addicted and that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely true.</v>

2678
01:49:44.630 --> 01:49:47.650
<v Speaker 1>You do run those problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You do run a chance there being a little</v>

2679
01:49:47.651 --> 01:49:48.310
<v Speaker 1>bit of a spike</v>

2680
01:49:48.310 --> 01:49:52.210
<v Speaker 3>once it becomes initially legal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you,</v>

2681
01:49:52.211 --> 01:49:54.670
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're gonna have to let people learn.</v>

2682
01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:57.100
<v Speaker 3>You have to raise your kids and tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>them to never do that shit.</v>

2683
01:49:57.250 --> 01:50:00.520
<v Speaker 3>You have to be around other people that </v>
<v Speaker 3>raise their kids and tell them,</v>

2684
01:50:00.521 --> 01:50:01.420
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't do math.</v>

2685
01:50:01.450 --> 01:50:02.210
<v Speaker 3>It's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kill you.</v>

2686
01:50:02.211 --> 01:50:03.610
<v Speaker 3>I don't do heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's bad for you.</v>

2687
01:50:03.820 --> 01:50:06.130
<v Speaker 3>You could smoke pot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not going to hurt you if you drank,</v>

2688
01:50:06.131 --> 01:50:07.420
<v Speaker 3>let me know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to be there.</v>

2689
01:50:07.421 --> 01:50:09.520
<v Speaker 3>I want to let you know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to make sure you don't drive home</v>

2690
01:50:09.521 --> 01:50:10.420
<v Speaker 3>drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2691
01:50:10.421 --> 01:50:15.421
<v Speaker 3>like you can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People can navigate their way through a </v>

2692
01:50:15.421 --> 01:50:16.210
<v Speaker 3>lot of different substances and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>society if you just allowed us to,</v>

2693
01:50:16.630 --> 01:50:21.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as soon as you start making shit </v>

2694
01:50:21.630 --> 01:50:21.630
<v Speaker 3>illegal and restricting the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2695
01:50:21.630 --> 01:50:22.030
<v Speaker 3>the access to a bunch of different </v>
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

2696
01:50:22.031 --> 01:50:23.890
<v Speaker 3>people can't figure out what's good and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's bad.</v>

2697
01:50:24.040 --> 01:50:26.260
<v Speaker 3>That's why there's a lot of people to </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that mushrooms will fuck your mind</v>

2698
01:50:26.261 --> 01:50:27.950
<v Speaker 3>up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know and that smoke pot,</v>

2699
01:50:27.980 --> 01:50:29.560
<v Speaker 3>you're become a lazy piece of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

2700
01:50:29.561 --> 01:50:31.240
<v Speaker 3>Because they don't have access to it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they have,</v>

2701
01:50:31.690 --> 01:50:33.970
<v Speaker 3>if everybody had access to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially wheat,</v>

2702
01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:35.470
<v Speaker 3>if everybody had access to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'd,</v>

2703
01:50:35.590 --> 01:50:40.590
<v Speaker 3>we would all think of it the same way </v>
<v Speaker 3>that stoners think of it stolen or is </v>

2704
01:50:40.590 --> 01:50:40.900
<v Speaker 3>pretty much universally look at pot and </v>
<v Speaker 3>say,</v>

2705
01:50:40.901 --> 01:50:42.190
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very beneficial to me.</v>

2706
01:50:42.191 --> 01:50:44.020
<v Speaker 3>It calms me down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gives you perspective.</v>

2707
01:50:44.021 --> 01:50:46.690
<v Speaker 3>It makes me silly and then there's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>medical uses for it all.</v>

2708
01:50:46.691 --> 01:50:51.691
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like universal amongst the people </v>

2709
01:50:51.691 --> 01:50:51.691
<v Speaker 3>that use it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2710
01:50:51.691 --> 01:50:51.691
<v Speaker 3>how come the other people don't share </v>
<v Speaker 3>that opinion?</v>

2711
01:50:51.691 --> 01:50:52.630
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's because they're not using it.</v>

2712
01:50:52.840 --> 01:50:55.420
<v Speaker 3>It's really that simple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The people that are anti pot,</v>

2713
01:50:55.540 --> 01:50:58.270
<v Speaker 3>it's possible that you have some weird </v>
<v Speaker 3>reaction to pot,</v>

2714
01:50:58.500 --> 01:50:59.650
<v Speaker 3>in which case I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

2715
01:50:59.651 --> 01:51:00.130
<v Speaker 3>don't do it.</v>

2716
01:51:00.130 --> 01:51:01.180
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to do it,</v>

2717
01:51:01.540 --> 01:51:06.540
<v Speaker 3>but I guarantee you if you're not doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>it and you're describing what it is you </v>

2718
01:51:06.540 --> 01:51:10.660
<v Speaker 3>don't know or they a mom or a dad or </v>
<v Speaker 3>brother that was like lazy as shit while</v>

2719
01:51:10.661 --> 01:51:11.550
<v Speaker 3>they spoke to me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that like,</v>

2720
01:51:11.560 --> 01:51:15.040
<v Speaker 3>oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I totally get that.</v>

2721
01:51:15.041 --> 01:51:15.460
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

2722
01:51:15.461 --> 01:51:17.080
<v Speaker 3>it's not like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your brother is fucking lazy.</v>

2723
01:51:18.070 --> 01:51:20.110
<v Speaker 3>They don't see enough ambitious donors </v>
<v Speaker 3>out there.</v>

2724
01:51:21.040 --> 01:51:24.490
<v Speaker 3>People don't understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will give you a different perspective</v>

2725
01:51:24.491 --> 01:51:26.440
<v Speaker 3>and it might not necessarily be a better</v>
<v Speaker 3>perspective,</v>

2726
01:51:26.441 --> 01:51:28.840
<v Speaker 3>but it's good to look at things a </v>
<v Speaker 3>different way all the time.</v>

2727
01:51:29.230 --> 01:51:30.750
<v Speaker 3>Every now and then rather,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2728
01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:32.440
<v Speaker 3>if you look at things the exact same </v>
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>

2729
01:51:32.441 --> 01:51:36.250
<v Speaker 3>you can get locked into sort of a mental</v>
<v Speaker 3>pattern where you think that things make</v>

2730
01:51:36.251 --> 01:51:37.270
<v Speaker 3>sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2731
01:51:37.271 --> 01:51:38.590
<v Speaker 3>and then you need like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a good,</v>

2732
01:51:38.710 --> 01:51:43.710
<v Speaker 3>good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>really fucking good real good bake </v>

2733
01:51:43.710 --> 01:51:45.250
<v Speaker 3>session where you just completely float </v>
<v Speaker 3>away,</v>

2734
01:51:45.550 --> 01:51:50.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you and your friends are sitting </v>

2735
01:51:50.550 --> 01:51:50.550
<v Speaker 3>around like how many times did we had </v>
<v Speaker 3>these conversations like especially like</v>

2736
01:51:50.550 --> 01:51:52.510
<v Speaker 3>after shows or were just completely </v>
<v Speaker 3>barbecued,</v>

2737
01:51:52.511 --> 01:51:57.511
<v Speaker 3>like eating dinner and we're all just </v>
<v Speaker 3>like breaking down the universe or </v>

2738
01:51:57.511 --> 01:52:00.451
<v Speaker 3>figuring out life or just having these </v>
<v Speaker 3>conversations where you almost connect.</v>

2739
01:52:00.790 --> 01:52:02.790
<v Speaker 3>Can't get there on your own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't.</v>

2740
01:52:02.830 --> 01:52:07.830
<v Speaker 3>There's some conversations with you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get to when you're high and you're </v>

2741
01:52:07.830 --> 01:52:07.830
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2742
01:52:07.830 --> 01:52:08.230
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I can take responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 3>for this conversation.</v>

2743
01:52:08.470 --> 01:52:09.410
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I ever would have got </v>
<v Speaker 3>here.</v>

2744
01:52:09.411 --> 01:52:10.780
<v Speaker 3>Everyone was on high,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

2745
01:52:12.750 --> 01:52:17.750
<v Speaker 2>Of course a lot of those conversations </v>
<v Speaker 2>are not as cool as they would be in </v>

2746
01:52:17.750 --> 01:52:21.261
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just talking about how fritos would be </v>

2747
01:52:21.261 --> 01:52:21.261
<v Speaker 2>getting a peanut butter and jelly </v>
<v Speaker 2>sandwich.</v>

2748
01:52:21.261 --> 01:52:23.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like those talks.</v>

2749
01:52:23.401 --> 01:52:28.401
<v Speaker 2>I was really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really nice marijuana driven talks </v>

2750
01:52:28.401 --> 01:52:28.401
<v Speaker 2>because you can't get that when you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>hammered.</v>

2751
01:52:28.401 --> 01:52:28.401
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2752
01:52:28.401 --> 01:52:28.700
<v Speaker 2>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2753
01:52:28.770 --> 01:52:31.810
<v Speaker 2>It's more like a good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a good stone</v>

2754
01:52:31.870 --> 01:52:33.250
<v Speaker 3>conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not a dumb one,</v>

2755
01:52:33.251 --> 01:52:38.251
<v Speaker 3>but a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know everybody's kind of in that </v>

2756
01:52:38.251 --> 01:52:40.441
<v Speaker 3>grove man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You figured out a lot of shit in those </v>

2757
01:52:40.441 --> 01:52:40.441
<v Speaker 3>conversations.</v>

2758

<v Speaker 1>Well not the felony to tell tmz ally </v>

2767
01:53:06.460 --> 01:53:09.080
<v Speaker 1>behind it.</v>

2772
01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:21.230
<v Speaker 1>cap city comedy club and I was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>austin.</v>

2773
01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:24.020
<v Speaker 1>I was down in austin for the fight for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the troops and I had friday off,</v>

2774
01:53:24.021 --> 01:53:29.021
<v Speaker 1>so I went to cap city at norton,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had some of the funniest fucking jokes </v>

2775
01:53:29.490 --> 01:53:32.450
<v Speaker 1>on tiger woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>

01:53:32.451 --> 01:53:36.020
<v Speaker 1>He was killing me and mel gibson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was fucking killing me dude.</v>

2777
01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:38.090
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really funny shit.</v>

2778
01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:39.410
<v Speaker 1>Putting out with them after.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2779
01:53:39.411 --> 01:53:39.740
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2780
01:53:39.741 --> 01:53:41.300
<v Speaker 1>We,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we went out to eat and club soda.</v>

2781
01:53:41.301 --> 01:53:43.990
<v Speaker 1>Kenny was there and chris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chris from the flusher joe.</v>

2782
01:53:44.050 --> 01:53:45.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a good guy.</v>

2783
01:53:45.500 --> 01:53:47.210
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was just,</v>

2784
01:53:47.211 --> 01:53:50.530
<v Speaker 1>it was so fun and refreshing and right </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I think that,</v>

2785
01:53:50.540 --> 01:53:53.120
<v Speaker 1>like I always start thinking maybe I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have too many dick jokes.</v>

2786
01:53:53.450 --> 01:53:55.820
<v Speaker 1>Like why is my sense of humor so </v>
<v Speaker 1>juvenile,</v>

2787
01:53:55.940 --> 01:54:00.940
<v Speaker 1>like it's always like someone sucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>dicks or some dick goes in there or you </v>

2788
01:54:00.940 --> 01:54:02.000
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

2789
01:54:02.060 --> 01:54:04.220
<v Speaker 1>It just becomes a dick joke somewhere or</v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

2790
01:54:04.221 --> 01:54:06.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>time machine jokes become dick jokes.</v>

2791
01:54:06.550 --> 01:54:08.630
<v Speaker 1>Just I have a really juvenile sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>humor.</v>

2792
01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:10.490
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there's a problem with that.</v>

2793
01:54:10.890 --> 01:54:11.930
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I like.</v>

2794
01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:14.080
<v Speaker 1>Well maybe I should expand that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me try to like,</v>

2795
01:54:14.240 --> 01:54:19.240
<v Speaker 1>relax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I saw norton and every other </v>

2796
01:54:19.240 --> 01:54:19.580
<v Speaker 1>job was a dick joke and I fucking how </v>
<v Speaker 1>old all the way through.</v>

2797
01:54:19.610 --> 01:54:22.110
<v Speaker 1>Like it literally every other joke and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we had a conversation about it.</v>

2798
01:54:22.120 --> 01:54:27.120
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you like gave me like positive </v>

2799
01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:28.871
<v Speaker 1>affirmation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes I worry that I have too </v>

2800
01:54:28.871 --> 01:54:28.871
<v Speaker 1>many dick jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2801
01:54:28.871 --> 01:54:28.871
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never think about that.</v>

2802
01:54:28.871 --> 01:54:31.400
<v Speaker 1>Think about that because that's what I </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about some of them.</v>

2803
01:54:31.460 --> 01:54:34.160
<v Speaker 1>Sick fucking person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's funny,</v>

2804
01:54:34.161 --> 01:54:35.270
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was really funny.</v>

2805
01:54:35.271 --> 01:54:37.700
<v Speaker 1>It was refreshing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good to see,</v>

2806
01:54:37.930 --> 01:54:39.830
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we work all the time.</v>

2807
01:54:39.831 --> 01:54:44.831
<v Speaker 1>It's like I don't get to see like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a full headliner set that's like real </v>

2808
01:54:44.831 --> 01:54:48.161
<v Speaker 1>rare that I get to see someone in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy club working and just be an </v>

2809
01:54:48.161 --> 01:54:49.220
<v Speaker 1>audience member and sit down there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was cool man.</v>

2810
01:54:49.221 --> 01:54:50.660
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was howling.</v>

2811
01:54:51.050 --> 01:54:52.190
<v Speaker 1>But here's a weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2812
01:54:52.460 --> 01:54:55.490
<v Speaker 1>There was these two local comics that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were watching and the fucking,</v>

2813
01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:57.170
<v Speaker 1>he was killing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2814
01:54:57.290 --> 01:54:58.850
<v Speaker 1>Norton was fucking killing.</v>

2815
01:54:59.060 --> 01:55:04.060
<v Speaker 1>And these two guys were watching like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this hate or sad faced just totally dead</v>

2816
01:55:04.281 --> 01:55:05.570
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>

2817
01:55:05.571 --> 01:55:06.860
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's weird.</v>

2818
01:55:06.861 --> 01:55:07.970
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you don't think this is.</v>

2819
01:55:08.360 --> 01:55:09.740
<v Speaker 1>I was crying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>laughing,</v>

2820
01:55:09.990 --> 01:55:11.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at certain points.</v>

2821
01:55:11.031 --> 01:55:13.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just really well crafted jokes.</v>

2822
01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.280
<v Speaker 1>Really funny here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This bit about tiger woods,</v>

2823
01:55:16.460 --> 01:55:16.940
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

2824
01:55:16.941 --> 01:55:18.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to fuck it up.</v>

2825
01:55:19.310 --> 01:55:21.020
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to paraphrase it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to ruin it.</v>

2826
01:55:21.021 --> 01:55:23.630
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was crying,</v>

2827
01:55:23.990 --> 01:55:28.990
<v Speaker 1>I was fucking crying and I looked over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys are stone faced haters,</v>

2828
01:55:29.840 --> 01:55:31.110
<v Speaker 1>haters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also.</v>

2829
01:55:31.130 --> 01:55:36.130
<v Speaker 1>They're trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're probably fascinated like it's a </v>

2830
01:55:36.130 --> 01:55:36.290
<v Speaker 1>big deal to be working with a big name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jim norton's a big name national act,</v>

2831
01:55:36.291 --> 01:55:37.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so then they get to work with them.</v>

2832
01:55:37.791 --> 01:55:39.800
<v Speaker 1>Then they're judging their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance against his.</v>

2833
01:55:39.900 --> 01:55:43.180
<v Speaker 1>Trying to think of there better than his</v>
<v Speaker 1>jealousy with comedy,</v>

2834
01:55:43.240 --> 01:55:44.050
<v Speaker 1>especially the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2835
01:55:44.050 --> 01:55:45.180
<v Speaker 2>the guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were like,</v>

2836
01:55:45.300 --> 01:55:45.770
<v Speaker 2>I could do</v>

2837
01:55:45.850 --> 01:55:48.280
<v Speaker 3>better than this person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well there's a lot of guys that are just</v>

2838
01:55:48.281 --> 01:55:53.281
<v Speaker 3>starting out or they've been doing it </v>
<v Speaker 3>for a couple of years that for some </v>

2839
01:55:53.281 --> 01:55:55.831
<v Speaker 3>reason they feel like your success like </v>
<v Speaker 3>takes away from their success and they </v>

2840
01:55:55.831 --> 01:55:56.460
<v Speaker 3>should have more success when they do </v>
<v Speaker 3>look.</v>

2841
01:55:56.461 --> 01:55:57.520
<v Speaker 3>Very weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2842
01:55:58.570 --> 01:56:03.570
<v Speaker 3>to be a person that wants to be on stage</v>
<v Speaker 3>with their voice amplified in a </v>

2843
01:56:03.570 --> 01:56:05.020
<v Speaker 3>spotlight on you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've got to be fucked up.</v>

2844
01:56:05.021 --> 01:56:07.960
<v Speaker 3>And I'm talking as one of them and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to two other ones.</v>

2845
01:56:07.990 --> 01:56:09.670
<v Speaker 3>You guys are both comics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2846
01:56:09.671 --> 01:56:10.840
<v Speaker 3>you both do stand up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2847
01:56:10.841 --> 01:56:13.510
<v Speaker 3>you've got to be fucking crazy to want </v>
<v Speaker 3>to do that.</v>

2848
01:56:13.780 --> 01:56:18.780
<v Speaker 3>And so a lot of these people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're like so desperate to even out </v>

2849
01:56:18.780 --> 01:56:19.720
<v Speaker 3>their life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're so desperate to finally get some</v>

2850
01:56:19.721 --> 01:56:24.721
<v Speaker 3>success.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So desperate to put it all together and </v>

2851
01:56:24.721 --> 01:56:27.151
<v Speaker 3>have the big picture in front of them </v>
<v Speaker 3>and finally move on past this disaster </v>

2852
01:56:27.151 --> 01:56:27.151
<v Speaker 3>of a childhood that they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2853
01:56:27.151 --> 01:56:28.660
<v Speaker 3>they didn't want to claim ownership of </v>
<v Speaker 3>their life.</v>

2854
01:56:28.661 --> 01:56:30.400
<v Speaker 3>So they get like super hyper ambitious.</v>

2855
01:56:30.730 --> 01:56:32.950
<v Speaker 2>I met people who are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2856
01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:38.000
<v Speaker 2>I hate sand up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just get up on stage because it's </v>

2857
01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:38.000
<v Speaker 2>challenging for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I hated every second of it.</v>

2858
01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:38.640
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's strange.</v>

2859
01:56:38.670 --> 01:56:40.200
<v Speaker 2>Who says that</v>

2860
01:56:40.420 --> 01:56:43.480
<v Speaker 3>you can be good and say that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 3>suck this period.</v>

2861
01:56:43.570 --> 01:56:48.570
<v Speaker 3>Except steve martin.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Steve martin didn't like standing up in </v>

2862
01:56:48.570 --> 01:56:48.570
<v Speaker 3>the end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2863
01:56:48.570 --> 01:56:49.120
<v Speaker 3>he was a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was too easy for them apparently,</v>

2864
01:56:49.121 --> 01:56:50.200
<v Speaker 3>and he was awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2865
01:56:50.201 --> 01:56:53.140
<v Speaker 3>let's get small.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's some fucking great shit.</v>

2866
01:56:53.400 --> 01:56:56.130
<v Speaker 3>Like I remember when the jerk came out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>steve martin was holding</v>

2867
01:56:56.740 --> 01:56:59.630
<v Speaker 2>various johnson navan sounds like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>typical day.</v>

2868
01:57:00.180 --> 01:57:02.100
<v Speaker 3>Fun shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was a funny,</v>

2869
01:57:02.101 --> 01:57:05.670
<v Speaker 3>funny comedian man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he just got too crazy.</v>

2870
01:57:05.671 --> 01:57:06.330
<v Speaker 3>He would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would.</v>

2871
01:57:06.390 --> 01:57:11.390
<v Speaker 3>He was so big that everything he said </v>
<v Speaker 3>got laughs and like he lost perspective </v>

2872
01:57:11.390 --> 01:57:11.640
<v Speaker 3>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2873
01:57:11.700 --> 01:57:13.530
<v Speaker 3>we stopped doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was so good.</v>

2874
01:57:13.540 --> 01:57:14.580
<v Speaker 3>He had a stop</v>

2875
01:57:17.420 --> 01:57:18.020
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

2876
01:57:18.070 --> 01:57:18.590
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2877
01:57:18.630 --> 01:57:21.440
<v Speaker 2>he was such a let down for me because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>was such a huge.</v>

2878
01:57:21.441 --> 01:57:23.540
<v Speaker 2>Steve martin was the letdown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>

2879
01:57:23.541 --> 01:57:28.541
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that part like around sergeant </v>

2880
01:57:28.541 --> 01:57:31.431
<v Speaker 2>bilko years where he just kind of lost </v>
<v Speaker 2>the part that was funny to me about </v>

2881
01:57:31.701 --> 01:57:36.701
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I can't really tell what it </v>

2882
01:57:36.701 --> 01:57:36.701
<v Speaker 2>is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's exactly what it is.</v>

2883
01:57:36.701 --> 01:57:36.701
<v Speaker 2>Just age I guess.</v>

2884
01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:39.220
<v Speaker 3>So it happens to all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It happens to almost everyone.</v>

2885
01:57:39.430 --> 01:57:42.430
<v Speaker 3>It's very difficult to maintain a sense </v>
<v Speaker 3>of humor as first of all,</v>

2886
01:57:42.431 --> 01:57:45.370
<v Speaker 3>as your body starts to decay and second </v>
<v Speaker 3>of all,</v>

2887
01:57:45.580 --> 01:57:48.550
<v Speaker 3>as you have all these relationship </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems,</v>

2888
01:57:48.551 --> 01:57:49.760
<v Speaker 3>which they always do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2889
01:57:49.800 --> 01:57:54.800
<v Speaker 3>you just have these fantastic weddings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It turn into bitter divorces and then </v>

2890
01:57:55.391 --> 01:57:56.110
<v Speaker 3>you wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2891
01:57:56.111 --> 01:58:01.111
<v Speaker 3>this is it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm here already and now I'm 45 or </v>

2892
01:58:01.111 --> 01:58:01.480
<v Speaker 3>something like that and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm a movie star and I'm making all this</v>

2893
01:58:01.481 --> 01:58:06.481
<v Speaker 3>money and I don't even enjoy myself and </v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even enjoy the product and what </v>

2894
01:58:06.481 --> 01:58:07.780
<v Speaker 3>is funny anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when you're not doing stand up,</v>

2895
01:58:08.020 --> 01:58:13.020
<v Speaker 3>when you don't have that immediate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for me at least i would not be </v>

2896
01:58:13.020 --> 01:58:16.381
<v Speaker 3>confident.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And whether or not what I think is </v>

2897
01:58:16.381 --> 01:58:16.381
<v Speaker 3>funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

2898
01:58:16.381 --> 01:58:16.750
<v Speaker 3>I know that I know how to make things </v>
<v Speaker 3>funny.</v>

2899
01:58:16.751 --> 01:58:21.751
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know what things are funny and aren't </v>

2900
01:58:21.751 --> 01:58:21.751
<v Speaker 3>funny because I do stand up so much.</v>

2901
01:58:21.751 --> 01:58:23.560
<v Speaker 3>So it's like you become immersed in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>language of comedy,</v>

2902
01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:28.680
<v Speaker 3>but when you're removed from that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>completely removed from the idea or the </v>

2903
01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:31.160
<v Speaker 3>act of creating the comedy and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>producing it and putting it on stage and</v>

2904
01:58:31.200 --> 01:58:36.200
<v Speaker 3>performing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then honing it and then sharpening </v>

2905
01:58:36.200 --> 01:58:36.200
<v Speaker 3>up the bits and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you learn things from that like,</v>

2906
01:58:36.200 --> 01:58:40.950
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was way better when I did it this </v>

2907
01:58:40.950 --> 01:58:40.950
<v Speaker 3>way because I got to it quicker and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people understood it better.</v>

2908
01:58:40.950 --> 01:58:43.510
<v Speaker 3>You become in the language of company b,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you stay good,</v>

2909
01:58:43.540 --> 01:58:45.760
<v Speaker 3>you stay good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But when they stopped doing comedy,</v>

2910
01:58:45.761 --> 01:58:50.761
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he stopped writing comedy and they just </v>

2911
01:58:50.761 --> 01:58:50.761
<v Speaker 3>sort of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just acting in movies for awhile.</v>

2912
01:58:50.761 --> 01:58:54.540
<v Speaker 3>Like you just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might as well be living on mars </v>

2913
01:58:54.540 --> 01:58:54.540
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not even living with people.</v>

2914
01:58:54.540 --> 01:58:56.510
<v Speaker 3>You're walking around in a plastic </v>
<v Speaker 3>bubble and people are getting used to,</v>

2915
01:58:56.520 --> 01:59:01.520
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>bagels and lox at the craft service </v>

2916
01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:01.520
<v Speaker 3>table and you pull it up in a ferrari </v>
<v Speaker 3>and complaining,</v>

2917
01:59:01.520 --> 01:59:03.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's an up knocking it shit,</v>

2918
01:59:04.470 --> 01:59:09.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and you go into set and you're getting </v>

2919
01:59:09.470 --> 01:59:09.470
<v Speaker 3>makeup put on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2920
01:59:09.470 --> 01:59:13.170
<v Speaker 3>they're fucking fitting a hairpiece to </v>
<v Speaker 3>you to make your hair look big and </v>

2921
01:59:13.170 --> 01:59:13.170
<v Speaker 3>thick.</v>

2922
01:59:13.170 --> 01:59:13.240
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what it was kind of a weird world</v>

2923
01:59:13.241 --> 01:59:18.241
<v Speaker 3>is that you're walking down the carpet </v>
<v Speaker 3>and then that's your interaction with </v>

2924
01:59:18.241 --> 01:59:21.541
<v Speaker 3>humans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Your interaction with humans is on the </v>

2925
01:59:21.541 --> 01:59:23.341
<v Speaker 3>set and people serving you and then your</v>
<v Speaker 3>next project and it's always this weird </v>

2926
01:59:23.341 --> 01:59:27.601
<v Speaker 3>relationship where you're a star and </v>
<v Speaker 3>their underlings and they all need to </v>

2927
01:59:27.601 --> 01:59:30.370
<v Speaker 3>keep you happy to keep their job and so </v>
<v Speaker 3>everyone's like super supportive and you</v>

2928
01:59:30.371 --> 01:59:32.320
<v Speaker 3>don't even know what the fuck is up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>what's down.</v>

2929
01:59:32.321 --> 01:59:35.170
<v Speaker 3>You just drunk all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was fucked up on pills,</v>

2930
01:59:35.770 --> 01:59:36.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2931
01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:41.400
<v Speaker 3>you don't even know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the reason why so many of these </v>

2932
01:59:41.400 --> 01:59:42.040
<v Speaker 3>guys become completely insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2933
01:59:42.100 --> 01:59:42.720
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

2934
01:59:42.721 --> 01:59:44.980
<v Speaker 3>that world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea of living like that,</v>

2935
01:59:44.981 --> 01:59:49.981
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you've got to be out of your fucking </v>

2936
01:59:49.981 --> 01:59:51.331
<v Speaker 3>head.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One of the most frustrating things ever </v>

2937
01:59:51.331 --> 01:59:51.331
<v Speaker 3>when I first moved to hollywood is just </v>
<v Speaker 3>dealing with actors.</v>

2938
01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:56.520
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>guys who have done it their whole lives </v>

2939
01:59:56.520 --> 01:59:58.921
<v Speaker 3>and guys who had been involved in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>business for decades and she'd be </v>

2940
01:59:58.921 --> 02:00:00.040
<v Speaker 3>dealing with them and you aren't even </v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking real.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you just,</v>

2942
02:00:00.851 --> 02:00:05.851

<v Speaker 3>fake and everybody accepts that </v>

2943
02:00:06.071 --> 02:00:11.071
<v Speaker 3>everyone's fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one's calling anybody out at any of </v>

2944
02:00:11.071 --> 02:00:11.071
<v Speaker 3>this and the behavior is so strange.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2945

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the girls were into it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>what's the problem?</v>

3001
02:02:07.700 --> 02:02:09.600
<v Speaker 1>If they liked it and he liked doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3002
02:02:09.620 --> 02:02:10.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just,</v>

3003
02:02:10.311 --> 02:02:12.050
<v Speaker 1>it's odd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You thought that he was gonna do to you.</v>

3004
02:02:12.051 --> 02:02:13.390
<v Speaker 1>That's why it was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3005
02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:18.400
<v Speaker 1>it's just weird that he does it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>he's ll cool j because a regular guy </v>

3006
02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:19.220
<v Speaker 1>who's not his status wouldn't walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>around like.</v>

3007
02:02:19.221 --> 02:02:21.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

3008
02:02:21.170 --> 02:02:24.050
<v Speaker 1>But he is ll cool j,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3009
02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:25.680
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what she's saying is weird.</v>

3010
02:02:25.681 --> 02:02:28.140
<v Speaker 1>It's just like a normal person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's walking up.</v>

3011
02:02:29.390 --> 02:02:31.850
<v Speaker 1>Is he using that credit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the girls actually like it,</v>

3012
02:02:32.150 --> 02:02:33.170
<v Speaker 1>that's where it gets tricky.</v>

3013
02:02:33.560 --> 02:02:37.620
<v Speaker 1>If they actually like him doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is he using it or not even saying that?</v>

3014
02:02:37.640 --> 02:02:39.910
<v Speaker 1>She's just saying it's weird seeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody act like a planner.</v>

3015
02:02:39.930 --> 02:02:42.620
<v Speaker 1>I don't give a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I totally agree with you,</v>

3016
02:02:42.621 --> 02:02:45.200
<v Speaker 1>but if they like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it still weird?</v>

3017
02:02:45.320 --> 02:02:46.490
<v Speaker 1>Like if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I saw that,</v>

3018
02:02:46.491 --> 02:02:48.530
<v Speaker 1>it would be weird if I saw some guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>walking around going,</v>

3019
02:02:48.560 --> 02:02:49.410
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's up baby?</v>

3020
02:02:49.411 --> 02:02:50.330
<v Speaker 1>It's ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gimme kiss,</v>

3021
02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:55.310
<v Speaker 1>but why would we judge this if we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he's enjoying it and they're enjoying</v>

3022
02:02:55.311 --> 02:02:56.420
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You knoW what I'm saying?</v>

3023
02:02:56.450 --> 02:02:58.220
<v Speaker 1>It's one thing if you came up to you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were like,</v>

3024
02:02:58.250 --> 02:02:59.510
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is fucking.</v>

3025
02:02:59.511 --> 02:03:00.820
<v Speaker 1>I just came here to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

3026
02:03:00.830 --> 02:03:03.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to be weirded out by some </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultive personality,</v>

3027
02:03:03.560 --> 02:03:07.220
<v Speaker 1>but that'd be me being prissy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then that's not you being prissy.</v>

3028
02:03:07.290 --> 02:03:10.160
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just thought it was someone should not</v>

3029
02:03:10.161 --> 02:03:10.910
<v Speaker 1>violate your space.</v>

3030
02:03:10.910 --> 02:03:12.010
<v Speaker 1>like if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you know,</v>

3031
02:03:12.040 --> 02:03:14.120
<v Speaker 1>if there was like if you were there or </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3032
02:03:14.121 --> 02:03:16.550
<v Speaker 1>you're dating guy and he's right next to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you and your uncle jay did that,</v>

3033
02:03:16.551 --> 02:03:17.750
<v Speaker 1>that would be disrespectful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3034
02:03:17.751 --> 02:03:18.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

3035
02:03:18.411 --> 02:03:20.240
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that then it's disrespectful.</v>

3036
02:03:20.241 --> 02:03:22.280
<v Speaker 1>Even if your boyfriend's not there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not supposed to go up to someone.</v>

3037
02:03:22.281 --> 02:03:23.480
<v Speaker 1>Just start touching them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3038
02:03:23.530 --> 02:03:25.820
<v Speaker 1>you gotta she's gotta know that you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3039
02:03:25.821 --> 02:03:28.820
<v Speaker 1>you like him first or there's got to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>some communication going,</v>

3040
02:03:28.821 --> 02:03:29.810
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I rub your shoulders?</v>

3041
02:03:29.811 --> 02:03:32.970
<v Speaker 1>You can't just go up and start rubbing </v>
<v Speaker 1>people he was doing and he liked it.</v>

3042
02:03:32.971 --> 02:03:37.971
<v Speaker 1>I liked it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could be guessed that to like the </v>

3043
02:03:37.971 --> 02:03:38.100
<v Speaker 1>clinton move and clinton will just pull </v>
<v Speaker 1>his dick out on girls' jail.</v>

3044
02:03:38.120 --> 02:03:40.010
<v Speaker 1>Clinton used to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3045
02:03:40.040 --> 02:03:41.310
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did it a bunch of times.</v>

3046
02:03:41.311 --> 02:03:43.280
<v Speaker 1>They're just hilarious because it's like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a frat boy move.</v>

3047
02:03:43.490 --> 02:03:48.490
<v Speaker 1>Like clinton would be alone with chicks </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just pull his dick out and people </v>

3048
02:03:48.490 --> 02:03:48.490
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could he do that?</v>

3049
02:03:48.490 --> 02:03:50.650
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you how he could do that </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it works.</v>

3050
02:03:51.300 --> 02:03:53.840
<v Speaker 1>It probably worked 80 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

3051
02:03:54.060 --> 02:03:55.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it probably worked even more than that.</v>

3052
02:03:55.701 --> 02:03:59.120
<v Speaker 1>He's fucking bill clinton.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I bet if he felt of thing,</v>

3053
02:03:59.270 --> 02:04:01.760
<v Speaker 1>he felt the green light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to go for it.</v>

3054
02:04:01.880 --> 02:04:04.820
<v Speaker 1>I bet he whipped out his dick and like </v>
<v Speaker 1>80 percent of the time it was a,</v>

3055
02:04:04.830 --> 02:04:06.380
<v Speaker 1>it was a home run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was those,</v>

3056
02:04:06.680 --> 02:04:09.950
<v Speaker 1>the awkward 20 that would just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would just crash into the woods,</v>

3057
02:04:09.951 --> 02:04:13.750
<v Speaker 1>like he misread them or they just got so</v>
<v Speaker 1>offended that he would do that,</v>

3058
02:04:13.751 --> 02:04:15.590
<v Speaker 1>that they just flipped over the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

3059
02:04:15.591 --> 02:04:16.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck it is.</v>

3060
02:04:16.611 --> 02:04:18.940
<v Speaker 1>But he would rock that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what he would do.</v>

3061
02:04:18.941 --> 02:04:22.310
<v Speaker 1>And just pull his dick out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's your hatred of hot chicks?</v>

3062
02:04:23.330 --> 02:04:26.210
<v Speaker 1>But hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not finished there.</v>

3063
02:04:26.840 --> 02:04:31.840
<v Speaker 1>So that's like what ll cool j is doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's doing a very mild version of </v>

3064
02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:32.360
<v Speaker 1>pulling his dick out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just going for it.</v>

3065
02:04:32.430 --> 02:04:32.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess so.</v>

3066
02:04:33.860 --> 02:04:35.450
<v Speaker 1>So if you're with a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

3067
02:04:35.570 --> 02:04:38.040
<v Speaker 1>and you really attracted the guy and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>pulls dick out his</v>

3068
02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:41.600
<v Speaker 4>dick out and you just go for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just be like,</v>

3069
02:04:41.610 --> 02:04:45.150
<v Speaker 4>what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am like really into them.</v>

3070
02:04:45.210 --> 02:04:47.610
<v Speaker 4>If you're really into the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's possible.</v>

3071
02:04:47.611 --> 02:04:48.650
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you were.</v>

3072
02:04:48.651 --> 02:04:51.810
<v Speaker 4>If I was to check into it was a perfect </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation,</v>

3073
02:04:51.811 --> 02:04:56.811
<v Speaker 4>the perfect circumstance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guy pulls his dick out and got to </v>

3074
02:04:56.811 --> 02:04:56.811
<v Speaker 4>go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the hell?</v>

3075
02:04:56.811 --> 02:05:00.020
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a difference though if </v>
<v Speaker 4>like really liking ll cool j because </v>

3076
02:05:00.020 --> 02:05:00.810
<v Speaker 4>he's you a celebrity and liking his rap </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then thinking,</v>

3077
02:05:00.811 --> 02:05:02.430
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now he has his dick out.</v>

3078
02:05:02.440 --> 02:05:04.470
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're not talking about ll cool j.</v>

3079
02:05:04.940 --> 02:05:08.490
<v Speaker 4>President is a different story.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're mixing up our metaphors,</v>

3080
02:05:08.820 --> 02:05:12.030
<v Speaker 4>but I think I totally agree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would think it would be gross too,</v>

3081
02:05:12.240 --> 02:05:16.620
<v Speaker 4>but if they like it and he likes it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it's a match made in heaven.</v>

3082
02:05:18.070 --> 02:05:19.560
<v Speaker 4>Heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3083

<v Speaker 1>weirder.</v>

3372
02:16:40.420 --> 02:16:43.000
<v Speaker 1>At one point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>money used to represent gold,</v>

3373

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>it used to represent your $100 bills </v>

3374
02:16:48.001 --> 02:16:48.001
<v Speaker 1>worth $100 worth of gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

3375
02:16:48.001 --> 02:16:50.110
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really mean that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>now it's like it's just,</v>

3376
02:16:50.170 --> 02:16:53.410
<v Speaker 1>you just have confidence that this $100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>is worth $100.</v>

3377
02:16:53.710 --> 02:16:56.380

<v Speaker 1>numbers are and where are these numbers </v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3428
02:18:47.341 --> 02:18:50.030
<v Speaker 1>the billions of dollars missing this </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube guy.</v>

3429
02:18:50.480 --> 02:18:53.120
<v Speaker 1>Banos fucking organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the halliburton shit.</v>

3430
02:18:53.121 --> 02:18:55.790
<v Speaker 1>How much money is missing there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If halliburton was like one guy,</v>

3431
02:18:56.180 --> 02:18:57.470
<v Speaker 1>they would never be able to get away </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that,</v>

3432
02:18:57.690 --> 02:18:58.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was one person.</v>

3433
02:18:58.740 --> 02:19:01.010
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's your missing billions?</v>

3434
02:19:01.011 --> 02:19:03.830
<v Speaker 1>Where is it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>

3435
02:19:04.020 --> 02:19:06.260
<v Speaker 1>it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But becAuse of the corporation,</v>

3436
02:19:06.650 --> 02:19:08.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like you could,</v>

3437
02:19:08.090 --> 02:19:13.090
<v Speaker 1>you could be missing billions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the weIrd thing is they get to vote </v>

3438
02:19:13.090 --> 02:19:13.790
<v Speaker 1>like a person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in these,</v>

3439
02:19:13.910 --> 02:19:16.910
<v Speaker 1>they get to use money like a person and </v>
<v Speaker 1>make donations like a person,</v>

3440
02:19:16.911 --> 02:19:21.911
<v Speaker 1>like one of the most recent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most recent findings or </v>

3441
02:19:21.980 --> 02:19:26.980
<v Speaker 1>supreme court rulings was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations have the same rights as an </v>

3442
02:19:26.980 --> 02:19:27.020
<v Speaker 1>individual so they could donate money.</v>

3443
02:19:27.200 --> 02:19:29.030
<v Speaker 1>An individual can donate like whatever </v>
<v Speaker 1>you want,</v>

3444
02:19:29.300 --> 02:19:32.180
<v Speaker 1>which is ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Vermont is a,</v>

3445
02:19:32.181 --> 02:19:37.181
<v Speaker 1>the first state to step up and deny that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vermont is the first date and the </v>

3446
02:19:37.181 --> 02:19:40.631
<v Speaker 1>recently announced that they are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to allow corporations to behave as</v>

3447
02:19:41.241 --> 02:19:46.241
<v Speaker 1>a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a human being and that they're going </v>

3448
02:19:46.241 --> 02:19:46.241
<v Speaker 1>to judge them in a different way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's kind of interesting.</v>

3449
02:19:46.241 --> 02:19:50.320
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting that one state finally </v>

3450
02:19:50.320 --> 02:19:50.320
<v Speaker 1>has the balls to step up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3451
02:19:50.320 --> 02:19:55.001
<v Speaker 1>Vermont has a weird state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always been like real kind of </v>

3452
02:19:55.001 --> 02:19:55.001
<v Speaker 1>hippie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3453
02:19:55.001 --> 02:19:58.840
<v Speaker 1>kinda like ben and jerry's grateful dead</v>
<v Speaker 1>fish and it's not that many people up </v>

3454
02:19:58.840 --> 02:19:58.840
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3455
02:19:58.840 --> 02:20:00.290
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that the way that bob dole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>god came from?</v>

3456
02:20:00.310 --> 02:20:01.370
<v Speaker 1>Not bob dole.</v>

3462
02:20:14.050 --> 02:20:15.750
<v Speaker 2>trying to search.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like searching my brain.</v>

3463
02:20:15.780 --> 02:20:16.110
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

3464

3466
02:20:19.240 --> 02:20:22.600

<v Speaker 1>I'm sure someone on twitter will tell me</v>

3467
02:20:22.601 --> 02:20:25.330
<v Speaker 1>almost immediately he was a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>articulate guy.</v>

3468
02:20:25.540 --> 02:20:30.540
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason he did this one </v>

3469
02:20:30.540 --> 02:20:33.691
<v Speaker 1>speech where a while he was doing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech fucking homeboy started yelling </v>

<v Speaker 1>just put a little poop coming out.</v>

3543
02:23:23.640 --> 02:23:28.640
<v Speaker 5>He had all the girls make chicken and </v>
<v Speaker 5>see what make the best chicken and then </v>

<v Speaker 5>Can you fucked it up?</v>

3547
02:23:33.860 --> 02:23:35.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's unfortunate.</v>

3548
02:23:35.180 --> 02:23:40.180
<v Speaker 1>Kicked her off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people aren't that good at making </v>

3549
02:23:40.180 --> 02:23:42.671
<v Speaker 1>chicken.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reality shows don't have to make </v>

3550
02:23:42.671 --> 02:23:43.400
<v Speaker 1>things up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3551
02:23:43.700 --> 02:23:45.200
<v Speaker 1>Those shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to.</v>

3552
02:23:45.350 --> 02:23:46.610
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shows like jersey shore.</v>

3553
02:23:46.620 --> 02:23:48.920
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's enough craziness out there.</v>

3554
02:23:49.160 --> 02:23:50.690
<v Speaker 1>Teen moms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to.</v>

3555
02:23:50.691 --> 02:23:51.560
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to make something though.</v>

3556
02:23:51.710 --> 02:23:56.710
<v Speaker 5>That's like I auditioned for that ww ii </v>
<v Speaker 5>divas thing and then I didn't really </v>

3557
02:23:56.710 --> 02:23:57.920
<v Speaker 5>know what it was all about and she tells</v>
<v Speaker 5>me I did.</v>

3558
02:23:58.040 --> 02:24:01.910
<v Speaker 5>When was this last week in the house?</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was like,</v>

3559
02:24:02.150 --> 02:24:02.960
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a show.</v>

3560
02:24:03.050 --> 02:24:08.050
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess like you get in the house and </v>

3561
02:24:08.050 --> 02:24:09.791
<v Speaker 5>then you do all these competitive type </v>
<v Speaker 5>things where you battle for like a wwe </v>

3562
02:24:09.791 --> 02:24:11.030
<v Speaker 5>diva where you do like interviews and </v>
<v Speaker 5>fights sometimes.</v>

3563
02:24:11.510 --> 02:24:13.610
<v Speaker 5>The girl was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're almost perfect for this spot,</v>

3564
02:24:13.611 --> 02:24:13.860
<v Speaker 5>dah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dah,</v>

3565
02:24:13.861 --> 02:24:14.480
<v Speaker 5>dah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

3566
02:24:14.481 --> 02:24:15.950
<v Speaker 5>sweet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I was thinking about it and I'm</v>

3567
02:24:15.951 --> 02:24:17.000
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

3568
02:24:17.001 --> 02:24:18.810
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be six weeks of filming </v>
<v Speaker 5>and they're gonna.</v>

3569
02:24:19.360 --> 02:24:20.630
<v Speaker 5>It's gonna be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Reality show.</v>

3570
02:24:20.631 --> 02:24:22.810
<v Speaker 5>Probably if it did work out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Alright.</v>

3571
02:24:22.910 --> 02:24:27.910
<v Speaker 5>so what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would never want to be in a house for </v>

3572
02:24:27.910 --> 02:24:27.910
<v Speaker 5>six weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I would never do those reality show.</v>

3573
02:24:27.910 --> 02:24:32.740
<v Speaker 5>But when you're 22,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I liked taking opportunities that sound </v>

3574
02:24:32.740 --> 02:24:33.590
<v Speaker 5>like kind of crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I actually would probably.</v>

3575
02:24:34.020 --> 02:24:35.900
<v Speaker 1>So you're going to do it even be a pro </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrestler.</v>

3576
02:24:36.470 --> 02:24:41.470
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some day when you're a big name pro </v>

3577
02:24:41.470 --> 02:24:43.121
<v Speaker 1>wrestling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on tv and you're battling will </v>

3578
02:24:43.121 --> 02:24:43.121
<v Speaker 1>say we called it here first when you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>

3579
02:24:43.121 --> 02:24:45.290
<v Speaker 1>like an interviewer and then you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>drawn into the fight,</v>

3580
02:24:45.500 --> 02:24:46.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's going to happen.</v>

3581
02:24:46.341 --> 02:24:47.020
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if they want.</v>

3582
02:24:47.150 --> 02:24:49.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a good move.</v>

3583
02:24:49.590 --> 02:24:50.850
<v Speaker 5>I would say do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it sounds fun.</v>
