<v Speaker 1>I'll do say manioc with depressive.</v>

150
00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:34.390
<v Speaker 1>Some people are,</v>

151
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:35.380
<v Speaker 1>are uh,</v>

152
00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:36.041
<v Speaker 1>OCD,</v>

153
00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:36.870
<v Speaker 1>some people are dead,</v>

154
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.600
<v Speaker 1>some people are dead and they're still great.</v>

155
00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.650
<v Speaker 1>They've been able to achieve great stuff on their life,</v>

156
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:42.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

157
00:03:42.101 --> 00:03:43.300
<v Speaker 1>so maybe I'm crazy when I was,</v>

158
00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:44.130
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

159
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

160
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:46.390
<v Speaker 1>I opened these experiences.</v>

161
00:03:46.391 --> 00:03:49.930
<v Speaker 1>I can help you one way or these experiences happening at night.</v>

162
00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.750
<v Speaker 1>I am not sure.</v>

163
00:03:52.751 --> 00:03:53.231
<v Speaker 1>I have not.</v>

164
00:03:53.231 --> 00:03:57.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure I have any of these experiences happen while you've been in the</v>

165
00:03:57.551 --> 00:04:02.080
<v Speaker 1>dream state or were you just been dreaming or just asleep and you were woken up?</v>

166
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.820
<v Speaker 1>I am not sure that that expert,</v>

167
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:05.291
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

168
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:06.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember anything that was the,</v>

169
00:04:06.701 --> 00:04:08.440
<v Speaker 1>was it nighttime type things?</v>

170
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.940
<v Speaker 1>It was at nighttime when you think you might have had something happened to,</v>

171
00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:13.840
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

172
00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.240
<v Speaker 1>I can't say something happened to me.</v>

173
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:17.680
<v Speaker 1>I have no proof.</v>

174
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.180
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know.</v>

175
00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.140
<v Speaker 1>What I'm going to tell you about is your brain produces a chemical while you're</v>

176
00:04:23.141 --> 00:04:23.800
<v Speaker 1>sleeping.</v>

177
00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.310
<v Speaker 1>But I'm gonna,</v>

178
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.770
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna tell you something and I'm going to be honest about it.</v>

179
00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.393
<v Speaker 1>Sometime</v>

180
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:35.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking at the clock and it's like I wake up and I look at the clock or</v>

181
00:04:36.131 --> 00:04:41.131
<v Speaker 1>right after and it's like the clock had events like a four hour or two hours.</v>

182
00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.250
<v Speaker 1>There was a time zone that I don't remember what happened.</v>

183
00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:46.690
<v Speaker 1>It's called falling asleep.</v>

184
00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:48.303
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>

185
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.030
<v Speaker 1>What do you think you think you're getting snatched up and taken away for a</v>

186
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.031
<v Speaker 1>couple of hours?</v>

187
00:04:52.031 --> 00:04:52.370
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

188
00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.900
<v Speaker 1>Think I'm,</v>

189
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.040
<v Speaker 1>maybe I fall asleep.</v>

190
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.100
<v Speaker 1>That's why I hope that's why I hope or I can drive.</v>

191
00:04:57.101 --> 00:04:58.090
<v Speaker 1>I can drive my car,</v>

192
00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.230
<v Speaker 1>I can drive my car.</v>

193
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.790
<v Speaker 1>And it already happened.</v>

194
00:05:00.791 --> 00:05:01.061
<v Speaker 1>I drove,</v>

195
00:05:01.061 --> 00:05:01.900
<v Speaker 1>I drove my car.</v>

196
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.430
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] I dunno,</v>

197
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.140
<v Speaker 1>I drove my car in a normal day,</v>

198
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:06.580
<v Speaker 1>like going somewhere.</v>

199
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.060
<v Speaker 1>Then I look and there's two hour pass.</v>

200
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm like two hour.</v>

201
00:05:11.581 --> 00:05:13.300
<v Speaker 1>I'd just pass like this.</v>

202
00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.681
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe,</v>

203
00:05:14.681 --> 00:05:15.950
<v Speaker 1>maybe I didn't see it.</v>

204
00:05:15.951 --> 00:05:16.750
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I didn't,</v>

205
00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:17.111
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

206
00:05:17.111 --> 00:05:17.944
<v Speaker 1>I didn't,</v>

207
00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.770
<v Speaker 1>I maybe I watched their tie the wrong time.</v>

208
00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.990
<v Speaker 1>Like I watched my clock and I made a mistake myself.</v>

209
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.560
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

210
00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.221
<v Speaker 1>Most likely,</v>

211
00:05:24.221 --> 00:05:24.880
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

212
00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:25.330
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

213
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.163
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

214
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.890
<v Speaker 1>I hope so.</v>

215
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.630
<v Speaker 1>Well that's very minor stuff.</v>

216
00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:29.830
<v Speaker 1>That's very minor stuff.</v>

217
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:30.290
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

218
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.690
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

219
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:32.560
<v Speaker 1>but that could be,</v>

220
00:05:32.561 --> 00:05:35.490
<v Speaker 1>you talked being tired because you push yourself and less stress.</v>

221
00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.380
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly,</v>

222
00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:37.840
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what I hope.</v>

223
00:05:37.841 --> 00:05:38.210
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

224
00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.210
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly what I hoped.</v>

225
00:05:39.211 --> 00:05:39.700
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

226
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.670
<v Speaker 1>but you don't have any memories of great dudes putting fingers up your butt.</v>

227
00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:42.851
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

228
00:05:42.851 --> 00:05:43.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

229
00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.930
<v Speaker 1>None of that.</v>

230
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:45.730
<v Speaker 2>I've had a job where you're driving down the street,</v>

231
00:05:45.731 --> 00:05:48.310
<v Speaker 2>like on the highway and you're just like kind of dazed out and you're like,</v>

232
00:05:48.311 --> 00:05:48.551
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

233
00:05:48.551 --> 00:05:49.380
<v Speaker 2>how long I've been,</v>

234
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:49.750
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

235
00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.640
<v Speaker 2>I've been dazed out for like 20 minutes.</v>

236
00:05:51.641 --> 00:05:53.170
<v Speaker 2>What have I been doing for 20 minutes?</v>

237
00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:54.530
<v Speaker 2>Autopilot.</v>

238
00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:54.891
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

239
00:05:54.891 --> 00:05:55.521
<v Speaker 1>And then like,</v>

240
00:05:55.521 --> 00:05:57.560
<v Speaker 1>you just realize like almost all of a your home.</v>

241
00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

242
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.600
<v Speaker 3>But,</v>

243
00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.080
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

244
00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.460
<v Speaker 3>did the thing about being exhausted and sleep,</v>

245
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.880
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

246
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:02.181
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

247
00:06:02.181 --> 00:06:03.920
<v Speaker 3>and having these experiences at night,</v>

248
00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:04.490
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

249
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:05.031
<v Speaker 3>there's a,</v>

250
00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:07.100
<v Speaker 3>a chemical your brain makes that's,</v>

251
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:07.490
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

252
00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:10.460
<v Speaker 3>one of the most powerful psychedelic drugs don't demand.</v>

253
00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.950
<v Speaker 3>So one of the things they're trying to connect,</v>

254
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:14.090
<v Speaker 3>it's called DMT.</v>

255
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.010
<v Speaker 3>And one of the things they're trying to connect is,</v>

256
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.820
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

257
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.590
<v Speaker 3>people having near death experiences and people that have had UFO alien</v>

258
00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:25.070
<v Speaker 3>abduction type experiences and this chemical and that they can introduce this</v>

259
00:06:25.071 --> 00:06:26.390
<v Speaker 3>chemical into the human body.</v>

260
00:06:26.391 --> 00:06:31.070
<v Speaker 3>And these people have very similar experiences to what they had when they had a</v>

261
00:06:31.071 --> 00:06:33.260
<v Speaker 3>Ufo encounter or when they had,</v>

262
00:06:33.261 --> 00:06:33.640
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

263
00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.510
<v Speaker 3>a white light near death experience and counter.</v>

264
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:39.530
<v Speaker 3>And it's most likely there's this chemical that's doing this.</v>

265
00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.730
<v Speaker 3>So when people having these experiences that are very realistic and they do</v>

266
00:06:43.731 --> 00:06:45.290
<v Speaker 3>believe they're being taken the board by,</v>

267
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:45.831
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

268
00:06:45.831 --> 00:06:47.060
<v Speaker 3>a Ufo somewhere,</v>

269
00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.570
<v Speaker 1>they might not be wrong,</v>

270
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.550
<v Speaker 1>but this is not a Ufo encounter.</v>

271
00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.800
<v Speaker 1>This is just firefighting object.</v>

272
00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:54.990
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

273
00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:55.681
<v Speaker 1>I ain't gone through,</v>

274
00:06:55.681 --> 00:06:56.580
<v Speaker 1>we talk about that.</v>

275
00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.560
<v Speaker 1>If they had been thinking a board,</v>

276
00:06:58.650 --> 00:06:58.981
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

277
00:06:58.981 --> 00:06:59.711
<v Speaker 1>this is different.</v>

278
00:06:59.711 --> 00:07:00.151
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

279
00:07:00.151 --> 00:07:00.730
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

280
00:07:00.730 --> 00:07:03.800
<v Speaker 1>it could be a third type and encounter.</v>

281
00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.160
<v Speaker 1>There's many ways,</v>

282
00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:06.030
<v Speaker 1>but this is different.</v>

283
00:07:06.031 --> 00:07:06.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

284
00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:06.820
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

285
00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:08.340
<v Speaker 1>the I,</v>

286
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.301
<v Speaker 1>you talk about me,</v>

287
00:07:09.301 --> 00:07:09.961
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any,</v>

288
00:07:09.961 --> 00:07:11.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any memory of such thing,</v>

289
00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:12.460
<v Speaker 1>but I thing I'd,</v>

290
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.500
<v Speaker 1>I though like I have,</v>

291
00:07:13.501 --> 00:07:13.981
<v Speaker 1>like you say,</v>

292
00:07:13.981 --> 00:07:14.640
<v Speaker 1>sometimes I fall,</v>

293
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:15.421
<v Speaker 1>I fall asleep,</v>

294
00:07:15.421 --> 00:07:17.850
<v Speaker 1>then I wake up is the time passed and I'm like,</v>

295
00:07:17.851 --> 00:07:19.750
<v Speaker 1>well it's like I just,</v>

296
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:21.000
<v Speaker 1>cause you're tired man.</v>

297
00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:22.250
<v Speaker 1>That's not aliens.</v>

298
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:22.431
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

299
00:07:22.431 --> 00:07:22.611
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

300
00:07:22.611 --> 00:07:23.170
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

301
00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:23.791
<v Speaker 1>Are you worried?</v>

302
00:07:23.791 --> 00:07:24.031
<v Speaker 1>He like,</v>

303
00:07:24.031 --> 00:07:24.510
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

304
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:25.360
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's an alien.</v>

305
00:07:25.361 --> 00:07:26.310
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of what you do.</v>

306
00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:26.641
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

307
00:07:26.641 --> 00:07:27.710
<v Speaker 1>it's because I am,</v>

308
00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:29.700
<v Speaker 1>I felt like I didn't fall,</v>

309
00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:31.740
<v Speaker 1>I didn't fall asleep and I'm not tired.</v>

310
00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:32.341
<v Speaker 1>I'm wide awake,</v>

311
00:07:32.341 --> 00:07:33.174
<v Speaker 1>awake,</v>

312
00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:35.400
<v Speaker 1>but I fall asleep like this and it's kind of,</v>

313
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:36.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's kind of weird.</v>

314
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.070
<v Speaker 1>Hard sparring days.</v>

315
00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:38.820
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

316
00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:39.180
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

317
00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:43.260
<v Speaker 1>Just a normal day and I get good happen everyday when you get a Gopro,</v>

318
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.610
<v Speaker 1>like a camera and just record yourself all the time that happens.</v>

319
00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:48.503
<v Speaker 1>Watch it.</v>

320
00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's things record for like eight hours at a time.</v>

321
00:07:51.181 --> 00:07:51.900
<v Speaker 1>Some of them.</v>

322
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:52.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

323
00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.310
<v Speaker 1>How long has this been going on?</v>

324
00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:54.413
<v Speaker 1>Since I'm a kid.</v>

325
00:07:54.690 --> 00:07:55.523
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

326
00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.413
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

327
00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:02.690
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't it be crazy if the aliens like manufactured you to be a mixed martial</v>

328
00:08:04.651 --> 00:08:05.690
<v Speaker 1>arts fighter to like,</v>

329
00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:09.180
<v Speaker 1>let's see if we could just turn this [inaudible] would have happened.</v>

330
00:08:09.181 --> 00:08:10.590
<v Speaker 1>I would have been much better than,</v>

331
00:08:10.591 --> 00:08:11.011
<v Speaker 1>than,</v>

332
00:08:11.011 --> 00:08:11.790
<v Speaker 1>than this.</v>

333
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:12.630
<v Speaker 1>Much better than this.</v>

334
00:08:12.631 --> 00:08:13.570
<v Speaker 1>You're the fucking champion.</v>

335
00:08:13.890 --> 00:08:15.810
<v Speaker 1>But if I would be out of you in the manufacturer,</v>

336
00:08:15.811 --> 00:08:17.160
<v Speaker 1>I would it be a super amount of,</v>

337
00:08:17.161 --> 00:08:17.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

338
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:19.290
<v Speaker 1>well they just don't want to get ridiculous with it.</v>

339
00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:21.000
<v Speaker 1>It would be.</v>

340
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:21.311
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

341
00:08:21.311 --> 00:08:21.751
<v Speaker 1>that would be,</v>

342
00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:24.370
<v Speaker 1>obviously you can't turn a guy into a goddamn superhero.</v>

343
00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:25.231
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

344
00:08:25.231 --> 00:08:26.100
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that manufacturer</v>

345
00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:27.920
<v Speaker 3>Jon Jones,</v>

346
00:08:27.921 --> 00:08:28.754
<v Speaker 3>maybe they did.</v>

347
00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:29.933
<v Speaker 3>Aldo.</v>

348
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.360
<v Speaker 3>Maybe someone needs to talk to them about their sleep patterns.</v>

349
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.940
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they're falling asleep behind the wheel too and being sucked to board a</v>

350
00:08:34.941 --> 00:08:36.200
<v Speaker 3>space ship for repairs.</v>

351
00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:38.040
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they don't want to talk about it.</v>

352
00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:39.030
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they don't say it,</v>

353
00:08:39.031 --> 00:08:39.661
<v Speaker 1>but maybe they are.</v>

354
00:08:39.661 --> 00:08:40.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

355
00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:40.591
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

356
00:08:40.591 --> 00:08:42.210
<v Speaker 1>I don't have enough breadth in the,</v>

357
00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.750
<v Speaker 1>I think it's funny though that that's maybe one subject that you,</v>

358
00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:46.603
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

359
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.700
<v Speaker 1>you had a really hard time talking about that I do because it's,</v>

360
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:49.901
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

361
00:08:49.901 --> 00:08:51.680
<v Speaker 1>it sounds crazy and I,</v>

362
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:53.610
<v Speaker 1>and I will talk about it one day.</v>

363
00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:54.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to talk about my,</v>

364
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:55.770
<v Speaker 1>my,</v>

365
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:58.590
<v Speaker 1>all that stuff and uh,</v>

366
00:08:58.620 --> 00:08:59.131
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

367
00:08:59.131 --> 00:08:59.500
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

368
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't get the even through this.</v>

369
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:02.161
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

370
00:09:02.161 --> 00:09:03.630
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I probably asked one day,</v>

371
00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.460
<v Speaker 1>I'll go,</v>

372
00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:04.830
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

373
00:09:04.830 --> 00:09:05.161
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

374
00:09:05.161 --> 00:09:05.461
<v Speaker 1>I'll,</v>

375
00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:06.300
<v Speaker 1>I'll talk about stuff.</v>

376
00:09:06.301 --> 00:09:08.670
<v Speaker 1>But it's not what you promised one day.</v>

377
00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:09.180
<v Speaker 1>I promise.</v>

378
00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:10.013
<v Speaker 1>One day.</v>

379
00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:11.460
<v Speaker 1>What is the difference?</v>

380
00:09:11.461 --> 00:09:12.001
<v Speaker 1>No tomorrow.</v>

381
00:09:12.001 --> 00:09:16.080
<v Speaker 1>Did you see rocky three when Apollo creed says that the rocky Balboa,</v>

382
00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:17.330
<v Speaker 1>you said maybe,</v>

383
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:18.690
<v Speaker 1>maybe I will die one day,</v>

384
00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:19.980
<v Speaker 1>maybe I'll die it tomorrow.</v>

385
00:09:19.980 --> 00:09:22.010
<v Speaker 1>I hope I touched wasn't nothing that people,</v>

386
00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:22.530
<v Speaker 1>oh.</v>

387
00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:23.320
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

388
00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.510
<v Speaker 1>how did you say that it was that French?</v>

389
00:09:24.511 --> 00:09:25.150
<v Speaker 1>I'll touch wood,</v>

390
00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:27.320
<v Speaker 1>not I touched the there would make</v>

391
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:29.551
<v Speaker 1>it happen,</v>

392
00:09:29.551 --> 00:09:30.384
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

393
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:31.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

394
00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.460
<v Speaker 1>Just let it go.</v>

395
00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.990
<v Speaker 1>Just whatever information you've got,</v>

396
00:09:33.991 --> 00:09:34.580
<v Speaker 1>spill it.</v>

397
00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:34.720
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

398
00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:35.401
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know.</v>

399
00:09:35.401 --> 00:09:36.061
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing my,</v>

400
00:09:36.061 --> 00:09:37.320
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing my own research.</v>

401
00:09:37.321 --> 00:09:38.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm researching on myself.</v>

402
00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:39.400
<v Speaker 1>Like you say,</v>

403
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.680
<v Speaker 1>that's the thing that you just told me.</v>

404
00:09:40.681 --> 00:09:42.510
<v Speaker 1>It's very interesting the chemical that,</v>

405
00:09:42.511 --> 00:09:43.344
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>

406
00:09:43.690 --> 00:09:44.523
<v Speaker 1>that's probably that.</v>

407
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy that I meet through today.</v>

408
00:09:46.381 --> 00:09:49.590
<v Speaker 1>And you tell that about me because I make me make me happy.</v>

409
00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.433
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

410
00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.820
<v Speaker 3>Well I think a lot of people think they're going crazy and it's not.</v>

411
00:09:53.821 --> 00:09:57.010
<v Speaker 3>It's just your brain makes psychedelic drugs is true.</v>

412
00:09:57.030 --> 00:10:00.330
<v Speaker 3>Your brain produces it and parts of your liver and your lungs,</v>

413
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:02.670
<v Speaker 3>they don't know why this stuff is in the body,</v>

414
00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:03.290
<v Speaker 3>but it's,</v>

415
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:05.490
<v Speaker 3>it's a super potent psychedelic.</v>

416
00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:06.853
<v Speaker 3>You brain makes it,</v>

417
00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:08.550
<v Speaker 3>it happens when you're sleeping.</v>

418
00:10:08.551 --> 00:10:12.000
<v Speaker 3>So if like the speculation is that it happens during rem sleep,</v>

419
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:15.060
<v Speaker 3>I don't think they have the most accurate way of measuring it,</v>

420
00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:18.150
<v Speaker 3>but they know it's in the body and they believe it's the,</v>

421
00:10:18.151 --> 00:10:22.080
<v Speaker 3>the theory is that it comes out during periods of heavy stress or when your body</v>

422
00:10:22.081 --> 00:10:26.370
<v Speaker 3>thinks it's going to die or in rem sleep and that those are the Times that you</v>

423
00:10:26.430 --> 00:10:30.390
<v Speaker 3>have higher levels of this stuff in your neurochemical soup.</v>

424
00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:32.123
<v Speaker 3>That's an interesting,</v>

425
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:32.641
<v Speaker 3>crazy,</v>

426
00:10:32.641 --> 00:10:33.600
<v Speaker 3>why would you brain,</v>

427
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:37.500
<v Speaker 3>why would your brain produce an incredibly potent psychedelic drug?</v>

428
00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:40.710
<v Speaker 3>So a lot of people that are having these nighttime experiences,</v>

429
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:45.360
<v Speaker 3>it could be just varying levels of this chemical that's going around in your</v>

430
00:10:45.361 --> 00:10:45.541
<v Speaker 3>brain,</v>

431
00:10:45.541 --> 00:10:47.610
<v Speaker 3>but that doesn't mean that these experiences aren't real.</v>

432
00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.770
<v Speaker 3>We don't know what the fuck sleeping is anyway.</v>

433
00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:50.131
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

434
00:10:50.131 --> 00:10:50.964
<v Speaker 3>what is sleeping?</v>

435
00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:52.080
<v Speaker 3>You shut your eyes,</v>

436
00:10:52.081 --> 00:10:52.920
<v Speaker 3>you shut off,</v>

437
00:10:52.921 --> 00:10:56.520
<v Speaker 3>you don't exist in this plane and your consciousness goes somewhere else.</v>

438
00:10:56.521 --> 00:11:01.170
<v Speaker 3>Like literally you have no memory of a giant chunk of your day and we have no</v>

439
00:11:01.171 --> 00:11:02.004
<v Speaker 3>problem with it.</v>

440
00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:07.100
<v Speaker 3>And yet we don't connect it to any other realm or the idea of there being other</v>

441
00:11:07.111 --> 00:11:07.711
<v Speaker 3>dimensions.</v>

442
00:11:07.711 --> 00:11:09.660
<v Speaker 3>You go into another dimension when you go to sleep,</v>

443
00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:10.141
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

444
00:11:10.141 --> 00:11:10.920
<v Speaker 3>you do,</v>

445
00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:11.820
<v Speaker 3>you just shut off,</v>

446
00:11:11.821 --> 00:11:14.430
<v Speaker 3>you stop and for all intents and purposes,</v>

447
00:11:14.431 --> 00:11:17.790
<v Speaker 3>you are in another dimension and if while you're in that other dimension,</v>

448
00:11:17.791 --> 00:11:21.810
<v Speaker 3>your brain is being pumped with this psychedelic chemical that when you take it,</v>

449
00:11:21.811 --> 00:11:24.300
<v Speaker 3>when you're sober makes you have these incredible experiences.</v>

450
00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.553
<v Speaker 3>It only seems to,</v>

451
00:11:25.710 --> 00:11:28.320
<v Speaker 3>it just seems like a normal thing to look into,</v>

452
00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:30.730
<v Speaker 3>like people that you should be looking into that like what?</v>

453
00:11:30.740 --> 00:11:33.000
<v Speaker 3>What is what is happening when you're sleeping,</v>

454
00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.270
<v Speaker 3>your sleep,</v>

455
00:11:34.270 --> 00:11:36.930
<v Speaker 3>you go away and everybody's just so used to it.</v>

456
00:11:36.931 --> 00:11:37.201
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

457
00:11:37.201 --> 00:11:38.034
<v Speaker 3>no big deal.</v>

458
00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:39.240
<v Speaker 3>We just go away.</v>

459
00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:40.830
<v Speaker 3>Just go away for eight hours a day.</v>

460
00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:41.641
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

461
00:11:41.641 --> 00:11:44.520
<v Speaker 3>everybody's scared to die and no one's scared to fall asleep.</v>

462
00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:45.661
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

463
00:11:45.661 --> 00:11:45.951
<v Speaker 3>you're just,</v>

464
00:11:45.951 --> 00:11:47.460
<v Speaker 3>you're shutting off man.</v>

465
00:11:47.580 --> 00:11:49.320
<v Speaker 3>You know you're going to be back so you're not worried,</v>

466
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:50.550
<v Speaker 3>but you're shutting off.</v>

467
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:51.720
<v Speaker 3>Whatever that is,</v>

468
00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:52.471
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

469
00:11:52.471 --> 00:11:53.680
<v Speaker 3>is just accepted.</v>

470
00:11:53.710 --> 00:11:55.510
<v Speaker 3>If sleeping didn't exist,</v>

471
00:11:55.780 --> 00:11:57.910
<v Speaker 3>it would be the craziest fucking thing.</v>

472
00:11:58.210 --> 00:12:00.910
<v Speaker 3>If all of a sudden you told people that they had to shut off for eight hours a</v>

473
00:12:00.911 --> 00:12:02.410
<v Speaker 3>night and just completely not be,</v>

474
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:03.071
<v Speaker 3>they'd be like,</v>

475
00:12:03.071 --> 00:12:04.030
<v Speaker 3>what are you talking about?</v>

476
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:05.710
<v Speaker 3>I've got to shut off the bike.</v>

477
00:12:05.711 --> 00:12:05.911
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

478
00:12:05.911 --> 00:12:08.590
<v Speaker 3>you're going to shut off for eight hours a night and you're not going to know</v>

479
00:12:08.591 --> 00:12:09.424
<v Speaker 3>what's happening.</v>

480
00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:11.470
<v Speaker 3>People can touch your balls while you're sleeping.</v>

481
00:12:11.630 --> 00:12:13.450
<v Speaker 3>You'll have no way of stopping them.</v>

482
00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:14.950
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of things that can happen</v>

483
00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:15.833
<v Speaker 1>that that showed us,</v>

484
00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:16.171
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

485
00:12:16.171 --> 00:12:16.741
<v Speaker 1>we don't know.</v>

486
00:12:16.741 --> 00:12:17.250
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>

487
00:12:17.250 --> 00:12:18.450
<v Speaker 1>We don't know what the fuck that is.</v>

488
00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:19.200
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>

489
00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:19.681
<v Speaker 1>I could like,</v>

490
00:12:19.681 --> 00:12:20.311
<v Speaker 1>you know what I can say?</v>

491
00:12:20.311 --> 00:12:21.870
<v Speaker 1>It's not that I'm afraid to be crazy.</v>

492
00:12:21.871 --> 00:12:22.540
<v Speaker 1>It's just I,</v>

493
00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:23.510
<v Speaker 1>I can say whatever dad,</v>

494
00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.980
<v Speaker 1>I won't and we don't know.</v>

495
00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:26.371
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>

496
00:12:26.371 --> 00:12:27.061
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

497
00:12:27.061 --> 00:12:27.570
<v Speaker 1>We don't know.</v>

498
00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:28.381
<v Speaker 1>We don't know the truth.</v>

499
00:12:28.381 --> 00:12:29.000
<v Speaker 1>We'd have no idea.</v>

500
00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:29.211
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

501
00:12:29.211 --> 00:12:31.160
<v Speaker 3>Somebody might be stealing time from you.</v>

502
00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:32.690
<v Speaker 3>They might be stealing time.</v>

503
00:12:32.691 --> 00:12:32.901
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>

504
00:12:32.901 --> 00:12:33.890
<v Speaker 3>this motherfucker's got it.</v>

505
00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:34.893
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

506
00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:39.470
<v Speaker 1>the truth is I feel like ad experience,</v>

507
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.700
<v Speaker 1>but I don't know what it is.</v>

508
00:12:40.701 --> 00:12:44.800
<v Speaker 1>So for me to say it salient or say it's a dead drug chemical you're talking</v>

509
00:12:44.801 --> 00:12:45.020
<v Speaker 1>about?</v>

510
00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:45.680
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

511
00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:46.051
<v Speaker 1>I can't,</v>

512
00:12:46.051 --> 00:12:47.000
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell you right now.</v>

513
00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:48.321
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what it is,</v>

514
00:12:48.321 --> 00:12:49.154
<v Speaker 1>but I did.</v>

515
00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:51.950
<v Speaker 1>I felt like it could have been an experience or not.</v>

516
00:12:51.951 --> 00:12:55.580
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I felt maybe I'm crazy and it's a normal thing that everybody would like.</v>

517
00:12:55.581 --> 00:12:56.414
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I,</v>

518
00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:57.511
<v Speaker 1>but right now I,</v>

519
00:12:57.511 --> 00:12:57.950
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

520
00:12:57.950 --> 00:12:58.161
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

521
00:12:58.161 --> 00:12:58.491
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

522
00:12:58.491 --> 00:12:59.130
<v Speaker 1>It's too,</v>

523
00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:01.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm making my own research too to find out about that.</v>

524
00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:02.330
<v Speaker 1>How are you researching?</v>

525
00:13:02.810 --> 00:13:04.700
<v Speaker 1>When I research a lot of stuff,</v>

526
00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:05.050
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

527
00:13:05.050 --> 00:13:08.840
<v Speaker 1>they commit that reason things and go on the Internet now.</v>

528
00:13:08.841 --> 00:13:10.340
<v Speaker 1>It's another thing that he just said to me.</v>

529
00:13:10.341 --> 00:13:12.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to research that made by research on their own.</v>

530
00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.393
<v Speaker 1>I mean by resources,</v>

531
00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:14.840
<v Speaker 1>things that the people that have,</v>

532
00:13:14.841 --> 00:13:17.660
<v Speaker 1>I've tried because that lap laptops time that you don't remember,</v>

533
00:13:17.661 --> 00:13:17.961
<v Speaker 1>they've been,</v>

534
00:13:17.961 --> 00:13:20.300
<v Speaker 1>some people been hypnotized and they are the bad,</v>

535
00:13:20.301 --> 00:13:21.830
<v Speaker 1>the bad,</v>

536
00:13:21.831 --> 00:13:22.340
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

537
00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:23.100
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

538
00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:23.721
<v Speaker 1>That venture,</v>

539
00:13:23.721 --> 00:13:25.010
<v Speaker 1>and I don't want to be an uptight,</v>

540
00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:27.530
<v Speaker 3>well that's very controversial.</v>

541
00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:28.540
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

542
00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.440
<v Speaker 3>what's happening during hypnosis,</v>

543
00:13:30.441 --> 00:13:31.520
<v Speaker 3>hypnotic regression.</v>

544
00:13:31.521 --> 00:13:35.000
<v Speaker 3>It's very controversial because there's a lot of people that believe that you</v>

545
00:13:35.001 --> 00:13:38.840
<v Speaker 3>can introduce fake memories and to a person while they're unconscious and then</v>

546
00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:39.561
<v Speaker 3>you could,</v>

547
00:13:39.561 --> 00:13:39.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

548
00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:40.160
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

549
00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:40.461
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

550
00:13:40.461 --> 00:13:44.930
<v Speaker 3>you could steer the events in one way or another and introduce false memories.</v>

551
00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:45.681
<v Speaker 3>It's not,</v>

552
00:13:45.681 --> 00:13:46.670
<v Speaker 3>it's not very,</v>

553
00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:47.780
<v Speaker 3>it's not very reliable.</v>

554
00:13:47.781 --> 00:13:48.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

555
00:13:48.801 --> 00:13:52.160
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the big things about these people that have these crazy stories</v>

556
00:13:52.161 --> 00:13:53.210
<v Speaker 3>from hypnotic regression.</v>

557
00:13:53.211 --> 00:13:54.860
<v Speaker 3>Like what the fuck is really going on?</v>

558
00:13:54.861 --> 00:13:55.080
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

559
00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:55.850
<v Speaker 3>you don't know.</v>

560
00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:59.310
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times people that are in therapy in the first place or a little wound</v>

561
00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:00.110
<v Speaker 3>does.</v>

562
00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:02.290
<v Speaker 3>So it's that those are the types of people that you're,</v>

563
00:14:02.291 --> 00:14:02.991
<v Speaker 3>you're dealing with.</v>

564
00:14:02.991 --> 00:14:04.100
<v Speaker 3>You're hypnotizing them.</v>

565
00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:07.550
<v Speaker 3>And then you're finding out about these nutty experiences with aliens.</v>

566
00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:08.870
<v Speaker 3>Who knows what the fuck.</v>

567
00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:11.281

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:34.740
<v Speaker 1>I build poured out of the water.</v>

584
00:14:35.190 --> 00:14:38.940
<v Speaker 1>In an end it was the people were breeding air was another environment.</v>

585
00:14:38.941 --> 00:14:42.930
<v Speaker 1>I saw a human being pulled know like amen grabbing me.</v>

586
00:14:42.931 --> 00:14:43.770
<v Speaker 1>I saw trees,</v>

587
00:14:43.771 --> 00:14:45.270
<v Speaker 1>I saw a bird in the sky.</v>

588
00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:46.061
<v Speaker 1>I saw,</v>

589
00:14:46.061 --> 00:14:48.630
<v Speaker 1>I liked like I saw and I'm like,</v>

590
00:14:48.631 --> 00:14:53.170
<v Speaker 1>I see a different thing in different and then you put it back yard official</v>

591
00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:54.410
<v Speaker 1>think he's completely insane,</v>

592

<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

593
00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:59.780
<v Speaker 1>So maybe in a way we're all like fish and,</v>

594
00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.230
<v Speaker 1>and maybe there is something like you said that when you see,</v>

595
00:15:03.231 --> 00:15:07.250
<v Speaker 1>but another university or another well or something and we don't know and we're</v>

596
00:15:07.251 --> 00:15:07.881
<v Speaker 1>right next to it,</v>

597
00:15:07.881 --> 00:15:08.714
<v Speaker 1>but we don't know.</v>

598
00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:10.610
<v Speaker 1>And if that's what I'm doing,</v>

599
00:15:10.611 --> 00:15:11.061
<v Speaker 1>research,</v>

600
00:15:11.061 --> 00:15:11.710
<v Speaker 1>I want to see,</v>

601

<v Speaker 1>what was the truth?</v>

606
00:15:15.351 --> 00:15:19.220
<v Speaker 1>Even though I probably will never found out the truth and I want to get closer,</v>

607
00:15:19.221 --> 00:15:21.800
<v Speaker 1>closer and find my own research to see what's happening,</v>

609
00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:24.460
<v Speaker 1>and we're all in the same pattern,</v>

610
00:15:24.461 --> 00:15:24.780
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

611
