<v Speaker 2>years just flew by because the neighbors</v>

66
00:03:13.741 --> 00:03:15.690

<v Speaker 1>early?</v>

79
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.080
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here's the thing.</v>

80
00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:47.040
<v Speaker 2>Standup was huge in San Francisco in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>eighties,</v>

81
00:03:47.041 --> 00:03:47.640
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

82
00:03:47.641 --> 00:03:50.290

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.960
<v Speaker 2>we had the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that morning show with Carrie snow and </v>

85
00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.980
<v Speaker 2>all those guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

86
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.700
<v Speaker 2>it was huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I just didn't know how to do it.</v>

87
00:03:59.701 --> 00:04:04.560
<v Speaker 2>And I was probably scared.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I remember I saw dice and I was like,</v>

88
00:04:04.561 --> 00:04:08.220
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I did one time at this bar,</v>

89
00:04:08.221 --> 00:04:12.660
<v Speaker 2>mcnear's in Petaluma and I went in and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>was just trying to be like,</v>

90
00:04:12.661 --> 00:04:17.661
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at those tests and I swear it was </v>

91
00:04:17.671 --> 00:04:18.880
<v Speaker 2>silent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

92
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.400
<v Speaker 2>fuck you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I thought this is how you do it.</v>

93
00:04:23.401 --> 00:04:24.480
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Man,</v>

94
00:04:24.481 --> 00:04:26.760
<v Speaker 2>I was tossed out of there of course</v>

95
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.090
<v Speaker 1>intangible and you see a guy like dice </v>
<v Speaker 1>that can say like some of the most </v>

96
00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.880
<v Speaker 1>offensive shit first of all because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know him and you know,</v>

97
00:04:33.881 --> 00:04:35.830
<v Speaker 1>like the character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's also,</v>

98
00:04:35.831 --> 00:04:40.831
<v Speaker 1>there's something about the way he did </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and like if you're a young kid and </v>

99
00:04:40.831 --> 00:04:41.920
<v Speaker 1>you see it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think you could go do it too.</v>

100
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.460
<v Speaker 1>You don't realize how stupid it sounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>until it comes out of your mouth and you</v>

101
00:04:45.461 --> 00:04:46.600
<v Speaker 1>realize like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh wait a minute.</v>

102
00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:48.040
<v Speaker 1>He's been doing this for a long time.</v>

103
00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.830
<v Speaker 2>Time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

104
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:53.840
<v Speaker 2>it's established in about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw dies in 88 at the store and she </v>

105
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:55.210
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

106
00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.240
<v Speaker 2>I used to hang at the store and my buddy</v>
<v Speaker 2>would like was dating the headway to </v>

107
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.870
<v Speaker 2>Sarah and and I'd probably rock and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood and then we'd go to the store </v>

108
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.640
<v Speaker 2>because it was huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was that before or after?</v>

109
00:05:05.641 --> 00:05:10.641
<v Speaker 2>He had become gigantic before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because I remember seeing him and then I</v>

110
00:05:10.921 --> 00:05:14.110
<v Speaker 2>think like a year later he was on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Rodney thing and that's like,</v>

111
00:05:14.111 --> 00:05:16.320
<v Speaker 2>that's that guy I was telling you guys </v>
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

112
00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:20.240
<v Speaker 2>but he would do Monday nights and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>would go on and,</v>

113
00:05:20.241 --> 00:05:23.010
<v Speaker 2>and all the rockers would go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rockers would be like,</v>

114
00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:26.180
<v Speaker 2>you gotta see this guy man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you go down there and he'd come out.</v>

115
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:28.350
<v Speaker 2>He'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at this whole,</v>

116
00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:29.070
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be like,</v>

117
00:05:29.071 --> 00:05:31.950
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck is this guy?</v>

<v Speaker 3>radical but hilarious.</v>

135
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.520
<v Speaker 2>It was radical back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

136
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:24.521
<v Speaker 2>everybody's just flying around a coke </v>
<v Speaker 2>and his eighties and there's rock bands </v>

137
00:06:24.521 --> 00:06:25.840
<v Speaker 2>and and great comedy going on.</v>

138
00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:30.890
<v Speaker 3>That's what's different now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a big thing that's different now </v>

139
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.890
<v Speaker 3>is coke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The comedians are not on coke.</v>

140
00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.570
<v Speaker 3>There's not a lot of comics on coke.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's all we'd.</v>

141
00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.170
<v Speaker 3>There's a few that drink,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but as far as like doing coke,</v>

142
00:06:37.171 --> 00:06:42.171
<v Speaker 3>maybe a couple of them might do it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's not like a Kennison thing were.</v>

143
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:47.450
<v Speaker 3>They're all just getting blasted like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you've heard Mark Marin's Kennison </v>

144
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:47.450
<v Speaker 3>stories.</v>

<v Speaker 3>the one about doing coke for like 78 </v>

146
00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:54.831
<v Speaker 3>hours and hallucinating for a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was hearing voices for a fucking </v>

147
00:06:54.831 --> 00:06:59.600
<v Speaker 3>year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had voices talking in his head for a </v>

148
00:06:59.600 --> 00:06:59.600
<v Speaker 3>year after that.</v>

149
00:06:59.600 --> 00:06:59.600
<v Speaker 2>That was the era man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

150
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.160

<v Speaker 2>Not every day,</v>

151
00:07:01.161 --> 00:07:03.800
<v Speaker 2>but like all of the time he just did </v>
<v Speaker 2>coke.</v>

152
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:05.630
<v Speaker 2>It was just what you did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

154
00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:10.790
<v Speaker 2>And it wasn't about getting high.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just about.</v>

155
00:07:10.791 --> 00:07:13.480
<v Speaker 2>Keep Rolling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's keep this rolling.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It's crossed out.</v>

164
00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:31.170
<v Speaker 3>I worshiped sleep so much now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

165
00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:35.190
<v Speaker 3>I know when you're young you'll put that</v>
<v Speaker 3>sleep off.</v>

166
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.710
<v Speaker 3>Just like I could stay up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've done that many times.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You're like working at like 40 percent </v>

172
00:07:54.081 --> 00:07:56.781
<v Speaker 3>capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you have to struggle with </v>

173
00:07:56.781 --> 00:07:56.781
<v Speaker 3>everything you do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>like just feeling like shit after </v>

178
00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.180
<v Speaker 3>pulling an all nighter and thinking the </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference between me then and me now is</v>

179
00:08:09.181 --> 00:08:14.181
<v Speaker 3>I'm probably more aware of how I feel </v>
<v Speaker 3>like shit now I'm more aware of what my </v>

180
00:08:14.181 --> 00:08:18.351
<v Speaker 3>body actually requires.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you're 20 years old and you do </v>

181
00:08:18.351 --> 00:08:18.351
<v Speaker 3>something like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you don't think anything of it.</v>

185
00:08:23.191 --> 00:08:24.410
<v Speaker 2>you're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's weird.</v>

186
00:08:24.411 --> 00:08:27.480
<v Speaker 2>You can lay there and when you hear your</v>
<v Speaker 2>body working,</v>

187
00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.180
<v Speaker 2>that's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When it's just gone,</v>

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:30.140
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>

<v Speaker 3>boom.</v>

190
00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:33.650
<v Speaker 3>And you think about what you've made it </v>
<v Speaker 3>do.</v>

191
00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:38.740
<v Speaker 2>It's just all booze and drugs in you and</v>
<v Speaker 2>you haven't eaten in a couple of days </v>

<v Speaker 2>A 44.</v>

194
00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:46.580
<v Speaker 2>I've been doing it for five and a half </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

195
00:08:46.581 --> 00:08:49.760
<v Speaker 2>Exactly last week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty 600 spots.</v>

196
00:08:49.850 --> 00:08:52.420
<v Speaker 2>That's a fucking hustle dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was weird.</v>

197
00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:54.200
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a true story.</v>

198
00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:59.201
<v Speaker 2>When I started thinking of doing comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the guys though have during the </v>

199
00:08:59.201 --> 00:09:00.360
<v Speaker 2>forties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

200
00:09:00.361 --> 00:09:03.030
<v Speaker 2>it's like you see K,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

201
00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:08.150
<v Speaker 2>Tom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>papa was watching a lot burger and I </v>

202
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:09.910
<v Speaker 2>had,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was really naive thinking like that.</v>

203
00:09:09.911 --> 00:09:12.470
<v Speaker 2>It's not an age thing like rock,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

204
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:14.390
<v Speaker 1>Dr Rosa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rockstar.</v>

205
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:19.630
<v Speaker 1>There's only a few guys that get to that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mick Jagger level where you can do </v>

206
00:09:19.630 --> 00:09:19.640
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck you want</v>

207
00:09:19.770 --> 00:09:24.360
<v Speaker 2>and they're looked at as like eno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>old rockers or whatever.</v>

208
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.030
<v Speaker 2>But comedians aren't looked at as old </v>
<v Speaker 2>comics.</v>

209
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:30.350
<v Speaker 2>They're looked at as comics because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

210
00:09:30.351 --> 00:09:35.351
<v Speaker 2>the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the killers are in their </v>

211
00:09:35.351 --> 00:09:35.351
<v Speaker 2>forties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

212
00:09:35.351 --> 00:09:35.351
<v Speaker 2>the guys I left.</v>

213
00:09:35.351 --> 00:09:35.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>

214
00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:40.970
<v Speaker 1>there's something about your insight </v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get into your forties that is </v>

215
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:40.970
<v Speaker 1>probably missing when you're in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>thirties.</v>

216
00:09:40.970 --> 00:09:45.901
<v Speaker 1>So can you throw that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can be really funny when you're in </v>

217
00:09:45.901 --> 00:09:46.020
<v Speaker 1>your thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's very rare that you find someone</v>

218
00:09:46.021 --> 00:09:48.240
<v Speaker 1>in their thirties that has like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>insight of a Louis,</v>

219
00:09:48.241 --> 00:09:48.760
<v Speaker 1>c,</v>
<v Speaker 1>k,</v>

220
00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:53.170
<v Speaker 1>like the point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unique perspective of a burger.</v>

221
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:54.090
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

222
00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.490
<v Speaker 1>it takes a lot of living to become that </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy.</v>

223
00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:57.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you got it,</v>

224
00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:00.170
<v Speaker 2>you have to travel or think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

225
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:00.660
<v Speaker 2>you do.</v>

226
00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:03.620
<v Speaker 1>You may have to come to their own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to understand your own bullshit</v>

227
00:10:03.621 --> 00:10:08.621
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which a lot of times you don't yet when </v>

228
00:10:08.621 --> 00:10:08.621
<v Speaker 1>you're in your thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're in your thirties,</v>

229
00:10:08.621 --> 00:10:09.860
<v Speaker 1>even if you're really funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might have some funny points.</v>

230
00:10:09.861 --> 00:10:11.810
<v Speaker 1>You probably don't understand your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>bullshit yet.</v>

231
00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:17.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to admit to yourself and figure </v>

232
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:17.860
<v Speaker 2>it out.</v>

<v Speaker 2>and then you talk about it on stage.</v>

234
00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.200
<v Speaker 2>Did you</v>

235
00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:25.300
<v Speaker 1>go to aa or one of those things where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you stand on a podium and make people </v>

236
00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:25.910
<v Speaker 1>laugh?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how a lot of guys start.</v>

237
00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I didn't do that.</v>

238
00:10:27.551 --> 00:10:31.150
<v Speaker 2>What happened was I drank and did coke </v>
<v Speaker 2>every night,</v>

239
00:10:31.151 --> 00:10:34.150
<v Speaker 2>but I sang every night and had three </v>
<v Speaker 2>guys in my band.</v>

240
00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:38.470
<v Speaker 2>I was losing my voice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I go to the doctor and he goes,</v>

241
00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:42.490
<v Speaker 2>you can't drink alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It dries out your folk accords,</v>

242
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:45.400
<v Speaker 2>you've got like what they call pre </v>
<v Speaker 2>notes,</v>

243
00:10:45.790 --> 00:10:50.790
<v Speaker 2>which is like calluses on your vocal </v>
<v Speaker 2>cords like Adele God or Steven Tyler or </v>

244
00:10:51.241 --> 00:10:56.241
<v Speaker 2>as Paul Stanley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you got to go in and get them </v>

245
00:10:56.241 --> 00:10:56.241
<v Speaker 2>lasered off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You won't be able to sing for six months</v>

246
00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:01.650
<v Speaker 2>and when the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're making a living even two </v>

247
00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:01.810
<v Speaker 2>days off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even with comedy,</v>

248
00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:05.110
<v Speaker 2>that completely makes the machine </v>
<v Speaker 2>crumble.</v>

249
00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.480
<v Speaker 2>So my guys are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey you,</v>

250
00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:08.860
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't drink.</v>

251
00:11:08.861 --> 00:11:09.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've got,</v>

252
00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.740
<v Speaker 2>we've got to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I felt like that too.</v>

253
00:11:11.741 --> 00:11:12.400
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alright,</v>

254
00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:14.440
<v Speaker 2>I gotta quit for a little bit and see </v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens.</v>

255
00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:19.440
<v Speaker 2>Then after three weeks went by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I felt fantastic and and I just never </v>

256
00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.290
<v Speaker 2>looked back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She never got it lasered?</v>

257
00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.440
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I did was he told me two things.</v>

258
00:11:23.441 --> 00:11:28.441
<v Speaker 2>Quit drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't talk all day and don't talk after </v>

259
00:11:28.441 --> 00:11:32.311
<v Speaker 2>gigs and I just chilled for like three </v>
<v Speaker 2>weeks and they slow and a lot of Ricole </v>

260
00:11:32.311 --> 00:11:35.250
<v Speaker 2>was throat coat tea and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

261
00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:37.420
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the number one thing I did wrong,</v>

262
00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:39.760
<v Speaker 2>which people don't know was when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>clear your throat,</v>

263
00:11:39.761 --> 00:11:44.761
<v Speaker 2>it's the worst thing you can do when you</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to the banks and vocal chords </v>

264
00:11:45.071 --> 00:11:50.071
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the worst thing you can do </v>

265
00:11:50.071 --> 00:11:51.250
<v Speaker 2>for maybe just a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I spoke with my vocal cords.</v>

266
00:11:51.251 --> 00:11:52.390
<v Speaker 2>Don't mind rumbling a little bit.</v>

267
00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:00.050
<v Speaker 3>Welcome cards,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lift weights to getting jacked,</v>

268
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.110
<v Speaker 3>running hills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>

269
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:04.000
<v Speaker 3>that was what made you quit drinking </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

270
00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:06.240
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hadn't hit a rock bottom.</v>

271
00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:08.940
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean I was getting pretty radical.</v>

272
00:12:08.941 --> 00:12:11.340
<v Speaker 2>I threw a beer and an anr guys face</v>

275
00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:17.870
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>record labels.</v>

276
00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:19.130
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

277
00:12:19.131 --> 00:12:21.830
<v Speaker 3>So we're doing a showcase for what does </v>
<v Speaker 3>it stand for?</v>

278
00:12:21.831 --> 00:12:23.870
<v Speaker 3>Artists and residents.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Representative</v>

<v Speaker 2>mentors are a represented artists were </v>
<v Speaker 2>relations,</v>

280
00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:31.190

<v Speaker 2>You threw a beer in his face.</v>

281
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:37.710
<v Speaker 2>We're doing a showcase and there was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bunch of record labels come down to see </v>

282
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:42.251
<v Speaker 2>us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all hot and right before we go </v>

283
00:12:42.251 --> 00:12:44.951
<v Speaker 2>on a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all start leaving our managers </v>

284
00:12:44.951 --> 00:12:44.951
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the fuck's going on.</v>

285
00:12:44.951 --> 00:12:47.550
<v Speaker 2>They were all leaving and so he calls </v>
<v Speaker 2>him the next day and they go,</v>

286
00:12:47.551 --> 00:12:49.670
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>such and such said he signed you guys,</v>

287
00:12:49.671 --> 00:12:52.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yesterday at lunch and so we left.</v>

288
00:12:53.150 --> 00:12:56.150
<v Speaker 2>It was like a scam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did take and watch this on his own.</v>

289
00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:01.480
<v Speaker 2>So I saw him about a month later I was </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty drunk at an awards show and I </v>

290
00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:05.290
<v Speaker 2>just had a beer and just right on his </v>
<v Speaker 2>face and topics and I was like,</v>

291
00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:06.530
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's probably not good.</v>

292
00:13:09.130 --> 00:13:10.400
<v Speaker 3>Good for the business.</v>

293
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:12.710
<v Speaker 2>Later though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I seen him later and he's like,</v>

294
00:13:12.711 --> 00:13:16.210
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty pretty gangster and really</v>
<v Speaker 2>gangster.</v>

295
00:13:16.230 --> 00:13:17.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he knew it was like,</v>

296
00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.180
<v Speaker 2>that's like the GNRH or rockers</v>

297
00:13:20.730 --> 00:13:23.580
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The fuck the guns and roses era.</v>

298
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.620
<v Speaker 3>Did you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>were you around for that?</v>

299
00:13:25.650 --> 00:13:27.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you see them come up?</v>

300
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.230
<v Speaker 2>I saw him come up big time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

301
00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:31.290
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I played in that whole scene,</v>

302
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:31.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

303
00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:33.360
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

304
00:13:33.361 --> 00:13:38.361
<v Speaker 3>that seems like one of the weirdest </v>
<v Speaker 3>errors of Hollywood because it seems </v>

305
00:13:38.361 --> 00:13:40.740
<v Speaker 3>like a rock and roll era that nobody </v>
<v Speaker 3>really saw coming like a late eighties,</v>

306
00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:44.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean outside of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there was,</v>

307
00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:46.740
<v Speaker 3>there's quite a few big bands from back </v>
<v Speaker 3>then,</v>

308
00:13:46.741 --> 00:13:49.220
<v Speaker 3>but not necessarily big bands from La,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

309
00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:50.910
<v Speaker 3>they were so much better than everybody </v>
<v Speaker 3>else.</v>

310
00:13:50.950 --> 00:13:52.890
<v Speaker 2>You had them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Jane's addiction really,</v>

311
00:13:53.350 --> 00:13:56.230
<v Speaker 2>those were the two and they played gigs </v>
<v Speaker 2>together and stuff.</v>

312
00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.950
<v Speaker 2>When you think about the two styles are </v>
<v Speaker 2>totally different,</v>

313
00:13:59.951 --> 00:14:04.951
<v Speaker 2>but they're both the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the recipes are the same danger and </v>

314
00:14:05.411 --> 00:14:07.810
<v Speaker 2>whenever you have something really </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking dangerous,</v>

315
00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:12.870
<v Speaker 2>it's gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna hit with kids because you </v>

316
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:12.870
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're coming out of that Reagan era and</v>

317
00:14:12.870 --> 00:14:16.330
<v Speaker 2>everything's kind of shitty and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like comedy was big in the eighties,</v>

318
00:14:16.331 --> 00:14:17.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when it's bad,</v>

319
00:14:17.891 --> 00:14:20.860
<v Speaker 2>people grab onto it and you had a long </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

320
00:14:20.861 --> 00:14:23.230
<v Speaker 2>have a bad music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

321
00:14:23.231 --> 00:14:27.790
<v Speaker 2>you had a bunch of Super Glam spandex </v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff and then this thing comes in.</v>

322
00:14:27.791 --> 00:14:32.110
<v Speaker 2>Welcome to the jungle and it feels real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the whole record is good.</v>

323
00:14:32.111 --> 00:14:34.570
<v Speaker 2>That's why it made it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't one,</v>

324
00:14:34.571 --> 00:14:35.530
<v Speaker 2>two songs.</v>

325
00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The record's fantastic.</v>

326
00:14:37.341 --> 00:14:40.730
<v Speaker 3>But if you look at the original video </v>
<v Speaker 3>for welcome to the jungle,</v>

327
00:14:40.731 --> 00:14:45.731
<v Speaker 3>he had t up here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's on the borderline of the Glam </v>

328
00:14:45.731 --> 00:14:49.871
<v Speaker 3>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like somebody must've talked him into </v>

329
00:14:49.871 --> 00:14:50.060
<v Speaker 3>dressing like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or he didn't know any better yet,</v>

330
00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:52.670
<v Speaker 3>but he hair was like Farrah Fawcett</v>

331

<v Speaker 4>or something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She's seen Dean's hair,</v>

332
00:14:54.171 --> 00:14:59.171
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just pictures that we could see </v>

333
00:14:59.171 --> 00:15:02.020
<v Speaker 4>online on instagram page or anything </v>
<v Speaker 4>that we could find.</v>

334
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:07.030

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

338
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:16.240
<v Speaker 4>Because it changed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then it was black bandanas and greasy </v>

339
00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:16.240
<v Speaker 4>hair and the heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

340
00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:19.190

<v Speaker 4>heroin.</v>

341
00:15:19.191 --> 00:15:20.360
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

<v Speaker 2>This was the turning point.</v>

343
00:15:24.870 --> 00:15:27.390
<v Speaker 2>They were grinding out and the record </v>
<v Speaker 2>came out.</v>

344
00:15:27.391 --> 00:15:29.430
<v Speaker 2>You know that record failed when it </v>
<v Speaker 2>first came out.</v>

345
00:15:29.431 --> 00:15:32.040
<v Speaker 2>People don't know the first single </v>

358
00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:06.600

<v Speaker 2>When you look at this,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you have tattoos.</v>

360
00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:14.610
<v Speaker 2>I have tattoos in this era of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>eighties when you had tattoos,</v>

361
00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:18.240
<v Speaker 2>that meant you were never working a </v>
<v Speaker 2>regular job at that time.</v>

362
00:16:18.241 --> 00:16:21.390
<v Speaker 2>Now you look at Chipola,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you work at starbucks wherever,</v>

363
00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:25.320
<v Speaker 2>but at that time that meant no one was </v>
<v Speaker 2>hiring.</v>

364
00:16:25.321 --> 00:16:30.000
<v Speaker 2>You accept construction or landscaping.</v>

422
00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:21.290
<v Speaker 4>That place is weird because it makes you</v>
<v Speaker 4>realize you can get a secondhand buzz </v>

<v Speaker 4>bullshit.</v>

<v Speaker 4>and the room is only 20 feet deep.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't see it.</v>

428
00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.600
<v Speaker 4>It's the,</v>

429
00:19:36.601 --> 00:19:41.160
<v Speaker 4>made Doug Benson Green out where he </v>
<v Speaker 4>passed out in the middle of the lobby.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Tony Hinchcliffe got off stage and he </v>

431
00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:48.300

<v Speaker 4>Smoking weed.</v>

<v Speaker 4>They get this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

448
00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:34.350

<v Speaker 4>like the oil light.</v>

449
00:20:34.351 --> 00:20:37.530
<v Speaker 4>So I cash exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it's even stronger they say.</v>

450
00:20:37.531 --> 00:20:42.531
<v Speaker 4>And then they've got this electrical </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking wand and they kind of rub it </v>

451
00:20:42.531 --> 00:20:43.860
<v Speaker 4>over it and then they suck in this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this like the word straight thc.</v>

<v Speaker 4>the waiver of what over it?</v>

456
00:20:51.050 --> 00:20:54.760
<v Speaker 5>It's pretty much exactly like smoking </v>
<v Speaker 5>crack foil.</v>

457
00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:58.050
<v Speaker 5>But it's in a nice glass thing.</v>

<v Speaker 4>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

<v Speaker 4>they carry a briefcase with prosperous.</v>

476
00:21:46.790 --> 00:21:50.070
<v Speaker 4>Like Ari and I were in Sacramento at the</v>
<v Speaker 4>punchline and this guy goes,</v>

<v Speaker 4>a DAB center.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What is going on here?</v>

479
00:21:54.851 --> 00:21:58.840
<v Speaker 4>So this guy's just hanging on there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>she's sort of working it while he,</v>

480
00:21:58.850 --> 00:22:03.850
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>turning and she's pretty much burning </v>

481
00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:03.850
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But Joe,</v>

482
00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:07.180
<v Speaker 4>now they have state of the art things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like electric wand and and,</v>

483
00:22:07.250 --> 00:22:09.550
<v Speaker 4>and it rubs over it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no fire.</v>

484
00:22:09.551 --> 00:22:12.610
<v Speaker 4>It's like electric.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is why potheads have a bad name.</v>

485
00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:13.850
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Total.</v>

486
00:22:13.910 --> 00:22:17.080
<v Speaker 4>He's guys waiting in line to get their </v>
<v Speaker 4>brains obliterated.</v>

487
00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:19.360
<v Speaker 5>I think I told you this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Joe,</v>

488
00:22:19.361 --> 00:22:23.890
<v Speaker 5>that I recently was in San Francisco and</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was one of these places across the</v>

489
00:22:23.891 --> 00:22:28.360
<v Speaker 5>street from the comedy club and me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>tiffany haddish and Tony went across the</v>

490
00:22:28.361 --> 00:22:33.361
<v Speaker 5>street to check out this damn place and </v>
<v Speaker 5>there was like half of the people were </v>

491
00:22:33.361 --> 00:22:36.550
<v Speaker 5>homeless that were just sitting there </v>
<v Speaker 5>spinning their money anywhere though.</v>

492
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:41.950
<v Speaker 5>But it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was like being in a crack house and </v>

493
00:22:41.950 --> 00:22:44.401
<v Speaker 5>it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it looked like people were doing crack </v>

494
00:22:44.401 --> 00:22:44.401
<v Speaker 5>and people were passed out like a crack </v>
<v Speaker 5>house.</v>

495
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.580
<v Speaker 4>The same thing because crack is like an </v>
<v Speaker 4>elevated thing.</v>

496
00:22:47.581 --> 00:22:49.080
<v Speaker 4>Like you get whacked out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

497
00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:51.720
<v Speaker 4>But this is just zombied from we'd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

498
00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:54.260

<v Speaker 5>And they are really Zombie though,</v>

<v Speaker 5>this guy's fucking dead and you're doing</v>

00:23:02.501 --> 00:23:07.501
<v Speaker 5>comedy for them for the night of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>living dead places.</v>

502
00:23:07.670 --> 00:23:09.670
<v Speaker 5>There's a place in north Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so the spot,</v>

503
00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:14.680

<v Speaker 5>it's a comedy stage and me and Freddy </v>

<v Speaker 5>Lockhart for try this place for me and </v>
<v Speaker 5>Freddy Book took a hit and then we </v>

505

<v Speaker 5>and these meet me and Freddy cough for </v>

<v Speaker 5>talk.</v>

507
00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:30.370
<v Speaker 5>I can't breathe and then we had to go on</v>
<v Speaker 5>stage.</v>

508
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:32.940
<v Speaker 5>Nobody was paying attention.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were looking through you.</v>

509
00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:36.370
<v Speaker 5>They were like figuring out like talking</v>
<v Speaker 5>to Jerry and you're like,</v>

510
00:23:36.371 --> 00:23:41.371
<v Speaker 5>they have no idea what was going on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One guy was face down in onto the stage </v>

511
00:23:41.371 --> 00:23:43.510
<v Speaker 5>in front of me and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're going to check on this guy</v>

512
00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:50.060
<v Speaker 4>jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>

513
00:23:50.061 --> 00:23:55.061
<v Speaker 4>Their pot really can't kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you had thought that was some of </v>

514
00:23:55.061 --> 00:23:56.360
<v Speaker 4>these dab guys with some of these people</v>
<v Speaker 4>that are,</v>

515
00:23:56.570 --> 00:24:01.570
<v Speaker 4>that have these crazy contraptions like </v>
<v Speaker 4>these ridiculous vaporizers somewhere </v>

516
00:24:01.570 --> 00:24:03.170
<v Speaker 4>online.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone must've fucking hit the wall.</v>

517
00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:05.630
<v Speaker 4>Nobody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody ever.</v>

518
00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:08.480
<v Speaker 4>I felt like I was dying on wait many </v>
<v Speaker 4>times.</v>

519
00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:09.710
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>

520
00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:10.760
<v Speaker 4>about five,</v>
<v Speaker 4>six,</v>

521
00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:16.130
<v Speaker 4>seven years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got back into we big time before I </v>

522
00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:17.240
<v Speaker 4>started comedy and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

523
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:20.180
<v Speaker 4>this isn't 80 sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

524
00:24:20.181 --> 00:24:25.181
<v Speaker 4>like one hit my heart with Guinness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's definitely a totally different </v>

525
00:24:25.181 --> 00:24:29.681
<v Speaker 4>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But apparently this kind of weed was </v>

526
00:24:29.681 --> 00:24:29.681
<v Speaker 4>available if you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

527
00:24:29.681 --> 00:24:33.890
<v Speaker 4>you check the has been some scientists </v>
<v Speaker 4>that have done some studies on the </v>

528
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:36.440
<v Speaker 4>different strains and like what the pope</v>
<v Speaker 4>potential potency.</v>

529
00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:40.430
<v Speaker 4>Apparently there was some pretty fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>strong weed back in the day,</v>

530
00:24:40.431 --> 00:24:42.410
<v Speaker 4>like Acapulco gold used to call it.</v>

531
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:44.630
<v Speaker 4>You could get ahold of some really </v>
<v Speaker 4>strong weed,</v>

532
00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:50.110
<v Speaker 4>but the strongest we'd today is stronger</v>
<v Speaker 4>than that and that weed was rare.</v>

533
00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:52.940
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

534
00:24:52.970 --> 00:24:56.780
<v Speaker 4>like you'll get a hold of some today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's not that good.</v>

535
00:24:56.781 --> 00:24:59.090
<v Speaker 4>But most of the week today is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking good.</v>

536
00:24:59.450 --> 00:25:04.130
<v Speaker 4>It was really rarely you would get like </v>
<v Speaker 4>quality California weed back then I just</v>

537
00:25:04.131 --> 00:25:05.870
<v Speaker 4>asked my uncle at the same thing and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>

538
00:25:05.871 --> 00:25:06.890
<v Speaker 4>you know about it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

539

<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

540
00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:09.260

<v Speaker 4>I had heard of it,</v>

541
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:10.100
<v Speaker 4>but he like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's like,</v>

542
00:25:10.101 --> 00:25:11.960
<v Speaker 4>I smoked weed every day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never saw it.</v>

543
00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.770
<v Speaker 4>I went to Cannabis Cup and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you,</v>

<v Speaker 4>they take it out there and you can vote </v>

545
00:25:20.810 --> 00:25:24.191
<v Speaker 4>on the weed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's in Amsterdam once a year and then </v>

546
00:25:24.191 --> 00:25:24.810
<v Speaker 4>the winners,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a big deal because the winter is,</v>

547
00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:27.710
<v Speaker 4>are these seeds for big money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was a judge,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I think it's more mellow for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

582
00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:56.100
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't seem to grab me and go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're heart,</v>

583
00:26:56.101 --> 00:27:01.101

584
00:27:01.101 --> 00:27:01.820
<v Speaker 4>weed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I feel like there's no,</v>

585
00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.260
<v Speaker 4>no feeling below.</v>

586
00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:11.500
<v Speaker 4>I usually feel the opposite of feeling </v>
<v Speaker 4>of too much feeling going on all the </v>

587
00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.410
<v Speaker 4>different processes that are happening,</v>
<v Speaker 4>feel at all,</v>

588
00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:18.680
<v Speaker 4>but it does loosen up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The bowels now does get you where you </v>

591
00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:25.170

<v Speaker 4>Right when I started comedy I realized I</v>

592
00:27:25.171 --> 00:27:27.720
<v Speaker 4>had to quit because it was wiping out my</v>
<v Speaker 4>short term memory.</v>

593
00:27:27.721 --> 00:27:30.540
<v Speaker 4>I'd be on stage in a bag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck what's next?</v>

594
00:27:30.541 --> 00:27:32.290

<v Speaker 4>but I can remember 20 years ago and this</v>

<v Speaker 4>but when you very start,</v>

639
00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:47.611
<v Speaker 4>did music and then what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what made you decide to do like an open </v>

640
00:29:47.611 --> 00:29:47.611
<v Speaker 4>mic night?</v>

641
00:29:47.611 --> 00:29:52.440
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happened was I stopped playing </v>

642
00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:55.141
<v Speaker 2>music basically because once the </v>
<v Speaker 2>download and came in the illegal </v>

643
00:29:55.141 --> 00:29:56.890
<v Speaker 2>download and there's just no money for </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

644
00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:59.140
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a mid level musician anymore.</v>

645
00:29:59.141 --> 00:30:01.840
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when I played music,</v>

646
00:30:01.841 --> 00:30:05.620
<v Speaker 2>you can play music for years and just be</v>
<v Speaker 2>touring like the jam bands,</v>

647
00:30:05.621 --> 00:30:10.621
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a Kinda grateful Dead Blues </v>

<v Speaker 2>Traveler,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Black Crows,</v>

649
00:30:10.621 --> 00:30:14.611
<v Speaker 2>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And make some money selling cds and </v>

650
00:30:14.611 --> 00:30:16.170
<v Speaker 2>shirts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But once people just grabbed the cds,</v>

651
00:30:16.171 --> 00:30:18.280
<v Speaker 2>it was out like guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd come home,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

654
00:30:22.211 --> 00:30:26.050

659
00:30:37.991 --> 00:30:42.991

<v Speaker 2>but when you've been on stage 25 years </v>

660
00:30:42.991 --> 00:30:43.540
<v Speaker 2>it starts to fuck with it.</v>

681
00:31:36.150 --> 00:31:41.150

<v Speaker 4>The annoying thing about being a </v>

682
00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:41.150
<v Speaker 4>salesman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

00:31:41.150 --> 00:31:41.160
<v Speaker 4>It's brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But there's</v>

684
00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.870
<v Speaker 2>con or comedy as.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not like a sales.</v>

685
00:31:44.871 --> 00:31:46.310
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

686
00:31:46.311 --> 00:31:51.311
<v Speaker 2>because you're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're constantly trying to get stage </v>

687
00:31:51.311 --> 00:31:53.891
<v Speaker 2>time and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and with sales you're constantly hoping </v>

688
00:31:53.891 --> 00:31:53.891
<v Speaker 2>somebody says yes.</v>

689
00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:57.840
<v Speaker 4>Salesmen is weird too because you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of a professional manipulator and a</v>

692
00:32:00.271 --> 00:32:05.271

<v Speaker 4>drug dealer because you're selling </v>

693
00:32:05.271 --> 00:32:06.660
<v Speaker 4>something to somebody that's proud </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're probably going to die on,</v>

694
00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:09.700
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what do you mean?</v>

695
00:32:09.890 --> 00:32:14.890
<v Speaker 4>Because they just don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't know how to ride and you're </v>

696
00:32:14.890 --> 00:32:15.710
<v Speaker 4>just there like here,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>up again.</v>

711

<v Speaker 1>30 feet bay at a time and that's 20,</v>

<v Speaker 5>texting into it.</v>

720
00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:17.880
<v Speaker 1>I've watched some lady with a kid in her</v>
<v Speaker 1>car today.</v>

721
00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:23.240
<v Speaker 1>She was doing that thing that sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 1>people they take driving and the it </v>

722
00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:26.520
<v Speaker 1>turns into like a sport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They try to like get in front of the car</v>

723
00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:31.550
<v Speaker 1>to the left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a two lane road and she was </v>

724
00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:33.771
<v Speaker 1>trying to get in front of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a guy to my right and there </v>

725
00:33:33.771 --> 00:33:37.071
<v Speaker 1>was a guy that was in front of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was like a little bit of gap </v>

726
00:33:37.071 --> 00:33:41.211
<v Speaker 1>between me and him and she was trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>speed and get into that gap and right </v>

727
00:33:41.211 --> 00:33:42.630
<v Speaker 1>when she was trying to speed someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>else came into her lane,</v>

728
00:33:42.631 --> 00:33:47.631
<v Speaker 1>they weren't paying attention and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a kid in her car and she had a slam </v>

729
00:33:47.631 --> 00:33:48.360
<v Speaker 1>on the brake and go flying into the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

730
00:33:48.390 --> 00:33:53.390
<v Speaker 1>into the side of the emergency role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I watched her do it and I watched </v>

731
00:33:53.390 --> 00:33:58.221
<v Speaker 1>her afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was like touching the kid's chest </v>

732
00:33:58.221 --> 00:34:00.651
<v Speaker 1>and talking to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to console him because the kid </v>

733
00:34:00.651 --> 00:34:00.651
<v Speaker 1>freaked out because she didn't need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>

734
00:34:00.651 --> 00:34:01.200
<v Speaker 1>There was no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no reason to do it.</v>

735
00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:03.600
<v Speaker 1>And she drove normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After that she was behind me.</v>

736
00:34:03.601 --> 00:34:05.670
<v Speaker 1>The entire whale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kept an eye on her,</v>

737
00:34:05.970 --> 00:34:07.710
<v Speaker 1>but I was like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was just like a game,</v>

738
00:34:07.740 --> 00:34:10.570
<v Speaker 1>like she wanted to make that gap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some</v>

739
00:34:10.570 --> 00:34:15.570
<v Speaker 5>girl I was on Laurel Canyon and she came</v>
<v Speaker 5>right up to me like right onto my ass </v>

740
00:34:15.570 --> 00:34:18.130
<v Speaker 5>and start flashing her lights,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like what the fuck is this lady doing?</v>

741
00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:21.970
<v Speaker 5>And then she tries to pass me and it </v>
<v Speaker 5>pushes me off the side of the road.</v>

742
00:34:21.971 --> 00:34:24.340
<v Speaker 5>As another car starts coming.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then she slams on the brake,</v>

743
00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:25.300
<v Speaker 5>goes behind me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

744
00:34:25.301 --> 00:34:30.301
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like she literally tried to like </v>

745
00:34:30.301 --> 00:34:32.340
<v Speaker 5>sideswiped me and then she gets ahead of</v>
<v Speaker 5>me and it kept slamming on her brakes </v>

746
00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:33.850
<v Speaker 5>and brake checking me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So finally,</v>

747
00:34:33.910 --> 00:34:35.380
<v Speaker 5>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is all on periscope.</v>

748
00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:40.560
<v Speaker 5>I finally got her ceiling up here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now you want to watch wanting to get </v>

749
00:34:44.831 --> 00:34:49.831
<v Speaker 5>past that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>look at this guy and I know I have a </v>

750
00:34:49.831 --> 00:34:54.360
<v Speaker 5>dash mount so it's just sitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then we get to a stoplight and I </v>

751
00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:54.360
<v Speaker 5>could pull up next to.</v>

752
00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:56.680
<v Speaker 5>I rolled down my window like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what the fuck is your problem?</v>

753
00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:59.080
<v Speaker 5>And said girl with her hair really </v>
<v Speaker 5>short.</v>

754
00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:04.200
<v Speaker 5>She just sitting there like that and she</v>
<v Speaker 5>takes off in front of me and it's </v>

755
00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:04.200
<v Speaker 5>brakes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>checks,</v>

756
00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:04.200
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what the fuck?</v>

757
00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:06.110
<v Speaker 5>A second light,</v>
<v Speaker 5>same thing or whatever.</v>

758
00:35:06.130 --> 00:35:07.080
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey Yo,</v>

759
00:35:07.110 --> 00:35:10.150
<v Speaker 5>you and she rolls down the window,</v>
<v Speaker 5>gives me the SMIRK,</v>

760
00:35:10.151 --> 00:35:11.500
<v Speaker 5>like say like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>

761
00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:14.230
<v Speaker 5>And then when it turns white she just </v>
<v Speaker 5>tries to side slamming again.</v>

762
00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:19.000
<v Speaker 5>You should run into her and then killer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then periscope.</v>

763
00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:21.220
<v Speaker 5>If I got her license plates,</v>
<v Speaker 5>periscope murder.</v>

764
00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:26.790
<v Speaker 5>I got her license plate number and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>realized how easy it is to get </v>

765
00:35:26.790 --> 00:35:28.150
<v Speaker 5>information from a license plate.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I had no idea.</v>

766
00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:30.940
<v Speaker 5>It's just a $40 google search.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's her name?</v>

767
00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:34.450
<v Speaker 5>What's his guy?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's really hot though.</v>

768
00:35:34.451 --> 00:35:39.451
<v Speaker 5>So she gets a pass.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She gets a pass passed so weak you will </v>

769
00:35:41.971 --> 00:35:45.180
<v Speaker 5>live your life in torture and you will </v>
<v Speaker 5>never learn.</v>

770
00:35:45.800 --> 00:35:49.140
<v Speaker 5>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bone structure gives her a pass.</v>

771
00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:54.200
<v Speaker 5>She's like half Japanese.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Half Mexican is just what is wrong with </v>

772
00:35:54.751 --> 00:35:56.850
<v Speaker 5>you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What is wrong with you son?</v>

773
00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:00.840
<v Speaker 5>Somebody sideswiped my car the other </v>
<v Speaker 5>day.</v>

774
00:36:00.841 --> 00:36:03.300
<v Speaker 5>$7,000</v>
<v Speaker 5>worth of damage to my car.</v>

775
00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:08.330
<v Speaker 5>Just parked in front of my street and I </v>
<v Speaker 5>had a drop cam and that that faces my </v>

776
00:36:08.330 --> 00:36:12.801
<v Speaker 5>front of my house and so I caught.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I caught the person like driving by and </v>

777
00:36:12.991 --> 00:36:15.750
<v Speaker 5>it was so fast that I couldn't even see </v>
<v Speaker 5>anything.</v>

778
00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:17.400
<v Speaker 5>It was just like they hit the car behind</v>
<v Speaker 5>me,</v>

779
00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:20.670
<v Speaker 5>hit my car and was going on hammered </v>
<v Speaker 5>probably 30 miles an hour.</v>

780
00:36:20.671 --> 00:36:20.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

781
00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:25.720
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This happens like once every three </v>

782
00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:26.220
<v Speaker 1>months I'll drive down one of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>little side streets.</v>

783
00:36:26.221 --> 00:36:31.221
<v Speaker 1>I was on a van,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Owen and Van Owen had this car that </v>

784
00:36:31.221 --> 00:36:35.360
<v Speaker 1>someone obviously hit full speed in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rear and it was parked on the side of </v>

785
00:36:35.611 --> 00:36:40.611
<v Speaker 1>the road because people are texting or </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're drunk or they fall asleep or </v>

786
00:36:40.611 --> 00:36:44.091
<v Speaker 1>something and those cars that are parked</v>
<v Speaker 1>every couple months I'll see one just </v>

787
00:36:44.091 --> 00:36:45.000
<v Speaker 1>caved in on the side of the road and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

788
00:36:45.001 --> 00:36:48.750
<v Speaker 1>someone just drove along and probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like looking down at a booty call.</v>

789
00:36:50.350 --> 00:36:51.910
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

790
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:54.090
<v Speaker 5>Did you see that one there?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Passed out like a month ago.</v>

791
00:36:54.091 --> 00:36:56.550
<v Speaker 5>She passed out in the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>highway and she just fell asleep,</v>

792
00:36:56.950 --> 00:37:01.950
<v Speaker 5>like pounding on the window.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And she won't wake up and so he had to,</v>

793
00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:05.010
<v Speaker 5>I think he broke the window or something</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that.</v>

794
00:37:05.011 --> 00:37:07.120
<v Speaker 5>I can't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But did she crashed somewhere else?</v>

795
00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:10.130
<v Speaker 5>She just stopped in the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>highway.</v>

796
00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:13.260
<v Speaker 5>Just took a nap.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cars were like full St Louis.</v>

797
00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:18.360
<v Speaker 5>She parked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is right here to turn up the volume </v>

798
00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:23.000
<v Speaker 5>on a freeway.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Cars moving behind the wheel of that </v>

799
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:23.000
<v Speaker 5>car.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ten years breaking news track or had the</v>

800
00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.730
<v Speaker 5>only camera there is that ran alongside </v>
<v Speaker 5>the car in the middle five.</v>

801
00:37:27.220 --> 00:37:32.220
<v Speaker 5>Try Breaking that window to get the </v>
<v Speaker 5>driver to wake up and get her to HP </v>

802
00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:37.140
<v Speaker 5>officer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's risking his life here.</v>

803
00:37:37.141 --> 00:37:39.340
<v Speaker 5>It's on a freeway.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A woman has passed out.</v>

804
00:37:39.341 --> 00:37:44.341
<v Speaker 5>I guarantee you somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A dude that is like I told you.</v>

805
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:52.590
<v Speaker 5>I told you that crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why we broke up.</v>

806
00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:54.480
<v Speaker 5>She's pretty cute though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd give her a pass.</v>

807
00:37:57.090 --> 00:37:57.750
<v Speaker 5>That's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Honey.</v>

808
00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:59.940
<v Speaker 5>Off It.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just need a driver.</v>

809
00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:02.850
<v Speaker 5>I remember I was watching the Uber</v>

810
00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:08.830
<v Speaker 2>Dmz and they're like rockstar crushes in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the non cars in Hollywood hills.</v>

811
00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:09.160
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

812
00:38:09.161 --> 00:38:10.410
<v Speaker 2>I got to see this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm laughing.</v>

813
00:38:10.411 --> 00:38:13.150
<v Speaker 2>And then I knew the guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it?</v>

814
00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:15.940
<v Speaker 2>It was this Guy Casey from this band a </v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

815
00:38:15.950 --> 00:38:18.420
<v Speaker 2>They're like a kind of a punk metal </v>
<v Speaker 2>band,</v>

816
00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:23.660
<v Speaker 2>but he was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess he was drunk and he hit a car </v>

817
00:38:23.660 --> 00:38:26.871
<v Speaker 2>that he backed up to try to get away and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the front tire came off and he didn't </v>

818
00:38:26.871 --> 00:38:30.480
<v Speaker 2>know she's pressing the gas in the car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just drove right into all the other cars</v>

819
00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:34.350
<v Speaker 2>because he had no steering.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then they added on film.</v>

820
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:41.040
<v Speaker 4>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just unbelievable that you're </v>

821
00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:42.910
<v Speaker 4>expected to drive two bars and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>figuring out how to get home.</v>

822
00:38:42.970 --> 00:38:47.970
<v Speaker 4>That's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The fact that everywhere you looked </v>

823
00:38:47.970 --> 00:38:48.520
<v Speaker 4>there handing out one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 4>ridiculous drugs,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Daniels within 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're fucking trash.</v>

<v Speaker 4>How's that bottle of wine legal like </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's like five glasses of wine.</v>

827
00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:03.520
<v Speaker 4>That's way beyond the legal limit for </v>
<v Speaker 4>two people in a dinner,</v>

828
00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:08.580
<v Speaker 4>an hour,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I only had one when they say that.</v>

829
00:39:09.510 --> 00:39:14.510
<v Speaker 4>If two people just sitting at a dinner </v>
<v Speaker 4>table drinking wine and it's a bottle </v>

830
00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:15.500
<v Speaker 4>and you finish the bottle off your both </v>
<v Speaker 4>hands.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Well yeah,</v>

847
00:39:49.510 --> 00:39:54.510

<v Speaker 4>It was just great being handed around </v>

848
00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:58.450
<v Speaker 4>Jesus Today on social media.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So none of us are going to be able to </v>

849

<v Speaker 4>drive anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all be stuck at applebee's.</v>

851
00:40:00.341 --> 00:40:05.341
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be like the steroid tests </v>

852
00:40:05.341 --> 00:40:05.341
<v Speaker 4>for the UFC to go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Everyone's just fucking completely empty</v>

854
00:40:10.331 --> 00:40:15.331
<v Speaker 4>because no one's car starts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would make that legal limit go up </v>

855
00:40:15.331 --> 00:40:15.331
<v Speaker 4>though if that happens.</v>

856
00:40:15.331 --> 00:40:19.740
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were not allowed to have a case of </v>

857
00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:19.740
<v Speaker 4>beer and two shots of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But no,</v>

858
00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:21.490
<v Speaker 4>they definitely would not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What they would do is,</v>

859
00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:26.510
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody would be hiring their little </v>

860
00:40:26.510 --> 00:40:26.830
<v Speaker 4>brothers and sisters to drive them </v>
<v Speaker 4>around the quiz.</v>

<v Speaker 4>On the right side.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does bigfoot exists now,</v>

862
00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:34.880
<v Speaker 4>but nothing definite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the type of people that are it.</v>

863
00:40:35.920 --> 00:40:37.390
<v Speaker 4>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why k y?</v>

870
00:40:58.570 --> 00:41:00.650
<v Speaker 4>you said no one really knows whether or </v>
<v Speaker 4>not those boots.</v>

871
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:03.310
<v Speaker 4>That's enough for me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a no for me.</v>

872
00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:05.080
<v Speaker 4>It looked like a dude in among your </v>

<v Speaker 4>but I'm telling you what,</v>

878
00:41:20.371 --> 00:41:24.661
<v Speaker 4>footage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can see those videos of him walking </v>

879
00:41:24.661 --> 00:41:27.030
<v Speaker 4>next to the actual footage of bigfoot </v>
<v Speaker 4>was just like that fucking guy in the </v>

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:34.020
<v Speaker 4>It won't load.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's legit.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Big Foot.</v>

887
00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:46.510
<v Speaker 4>I love that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just thought I grew up in the </v>

888
00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:46.510
<v Speaker 4>seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love,</v>

<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

890
00:41:46.510 --> 00:41:48.200
<v Speaker 4>that stuff that Leonard Nimoy would do </v>
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>

891
00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:51.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember he did the Noah's Ark one.</v>

892
00:41:51.830 --> 00:41:53.900
<v Speaker 4>He actually did the full movies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could go.</v>

893
00:41:53.901 --> 00:41:57.320
<v Speaker 4>I went to the drive and southern Noah's </v>
<v Speaker 4>arc one and the Ufo one.</v>

894
00:41:58.160 --> 00:41:58.760
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here it is.</v>

895
00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:02.000
<v Speaker 4>Drunk driving detector.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So how does this work?</v>

896
00:42:05.240 --> 00:42:07.760
<v Speaker 4>According to the National Highway </v>
<v Speaker 4>Traffic Safety Administration,</v>

897
00:42:07.761 --> 00:42:12.761
<v Speaker 4>approximately 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are killed by drunk drivers </v>

898
00:42:12.761 --> 00:42:13.040
<v Speaker 4>annually in the US.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at this.</v>

899
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:19.000
<v Speaker 4>The long arm of the laws handcuffing </v>
<v Speaker 4>this young man and taking him to the </v>

900
00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.700
<v Speaker 4>slammer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Research developing to detection methods</v>

901
00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:26.710
<v Speaker 4>for the driver alcohol detection system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One method allows the car to analyze a </v>

902
00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:29.060
<v Speaker 4>driver's exhale,</v>
<v Speaker 4>breath for alcohol content.</v>

903
00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:34.300
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's annoying because I had a friend </v>

904
00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:35.000
<v Speaker 4>who got a Dui and they made him do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

905
00:42:35.001 --> 00:42:39.110
<v Speaker 4>they're gonna have like a that just </v>
<v Speaker 4>smells your breath.</v>

906
00:42:39.150 --> 00:42:44.150
<v Speaker 4>Another method shines and infrared light</v>
<v Speaker 4>into your fingertips and it reads it.</v>

907
00:42:44.420 --> 00:42:46.670
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was used.</v>

908
00:42:46.671 --> 00:42:51.671
<v Speaker 4>Alcohol limit of ope point zero.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Eight blood alcohol content as it's </v>

909
00:42:51.671 --> 00:42:52.480
<v Speaker 4>standard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It used to be owed nine right there.</v>

910
00:42:52.481 --> 00:42:55.700
<v Speaker 4>No one was one when I was growing up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Parents could.</v>

911
00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:59.110
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder why they made it my money.</v>

912
00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:00.620
<v Speaker 4>Make money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you think that's what it is,</v>

913
00:43:00.621 --> 00:43:05.621
<v Speaker 4>or do you think it's because they </v>
<v Speaker 4>realize that more people are actually </v>

914
00:43:05.621 --> 00:43:06.260
<v Speaker 4>crashing like that?</v>

915
00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:09.940
<v Speaker 4>There must be some scientific basis for </v>
<v Speaker 4>the one point.</v>

916
00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:10.420
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eight,</v>

917
00:43:10.430 --> 00:43:11.660
<v Speaker 4>isn't there?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

918
00:43:11.661 --> 00:43:16.661
<v Speaker 4>but it seems to me that you should be </v>
<v Speaker 4>able to go in and take a test like a </v>

919
00:43:16.661 --> 00:43:18.800
<v Speaker 4>weed smokers as well and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

920
00:43:18.801 --> 00:43:22.080
<v Speaker 4>I've been drinking 25 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so my limit should be true,</v>

921
00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:24.830
<v Speaker 4>but the problem with that is then you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to push it even further.</v>

922
00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:25.760
<v Speaker 4>The guys who go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

923
00:43:25.761 --> 00:43:27.290
<v Speaker 4>I looked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I did the legal limit.</v>

924
00:43:27.291 --> 00:43:29.150
<v Speaker 4>I'd do three shots,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can handle five,</v>

925
00:43:29.180 --> 00:43:34.180
<v Speaker 4>come on and you'll just keep pushing it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you know that if you piss or you </v>

926
00:43:34.341 --> 00:43:36.250
<v Speaker 4>blow and oh eight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're fucked you,</v>

927
00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:39.320
<v Speaker 4>then you're not going to get drunk now </v>
<v Speaker 4>or if you do,</v>

928
00:43:39.590 --> 00:43:42.500
<v Speaker 4>you can't really argue about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to do these open mics.</v>

929
00:43:42.501 --> 00:43:47.501
<v Speaker 4>Joe and this girl had the the </v>
<v Speaker 4>breathalyzer on her car and she would </v>

930
00:43:47.501 --> 00:43:52.030
<v Speaker 4>pay guys to go out and breathe in or </v>
<v Speaker 4>ride so she could drive home </v>

931
00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:53.480
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 4>She would be drunk like where do you do?</v>

932
00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:55.100
<v Speaker 4>And so it looks like it's [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 4>98.</v>

933
00:43:55.101 --> 00:44:00.101
<v Speaker 4>In March of 98,</v>
<v Speaker 4>President Clinton called for the </v>

934
00:44:00.101 --> 00:44:01.850
<v Speaker 4>promotion of a national legal limit </v>
<v Speaker 4>under which it would be illegal per se,</v>

935
00:44:01.851 --> 00:44:06.851
<v Speaker 4>to operate a motor vehicle with a blood </v>
<v Speaker 4>alcohol concentration of point zero </v>

936
00:44:06.851 --> 00:44:09.680
<v Speaker 4>eight or higher across the country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>including federal property.</v>

937
00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:16.840
<v Speaker 4>He was just trying to get people to not </v>
<v Speaker 4>pay attention to this extra dirty freak.</v>

938
00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:20.390
<v Speaker 4>That guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that guys.</v>

939
00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:25.900
<v Speaker 4>That was the last ones are the ones like</v>
<v Speaker 4>and fucking relate to the real </v>

940
00:44:26.481 --> 00:44:31.481
<v Speaker 4>presidential dick slingers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't wait for him to be back in the </v>

941
00:44:31.481 --> 00:44:31.481
<v Speaker 4>history.</v>

942
00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:34.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 percent.</v>

943
00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:37.290
<v Speaker 1>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did some polls,</v>

944
00:44:37.291 --> 00:44:39.660
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After the emails and stuff,</v>

945
00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:41.150
<v Speaker 1>people are just like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're looking.</v>

946
00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:46.220
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people were looking for a reason to not </v>

947
00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:48.621
<v Speaker 1>like her because she's a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just get that out of the way and </v>

948
00:44:48.621 --> 00:44:51.920
<v Speaker 1>the fact that she's a woman that's also </v>
<v Speaker 1>a Clinton and it's a Clinton versus a </v>

949
00:44:51.920 --> 00:44:53.160
<v Speaker 1>bush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are fucking totally tired of this</v>

950
00:44:53.161 --> 00:44:58.161
<v Speaker 1>dynasty thing that's been going on for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the past x amount of decades where they </v>

951
00:44:58.161 --> 00:45:00.210
<v Speaker 1>just going back and forth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bush to Bush to Bush.</v>

952
00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:05.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean the idea of a Jeb Bush became </v>
<v Speaker 1>president after his brother fucked </v>

953
00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:09.231
<v Speaker 1>everything up and then his dad fucked </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything up before that and if that's </v>

954
00:45:09.231 --> 00:45:11.280
<v Speaker 1>not our option,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the Clinton option and it's Hillary</v>

955
00:45:11.310 --> 00:45:12.840
<v Speaker 1>and Hillary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary is.</v>

956
00:45:12.870 --> 00:45:15.160
<v Speaker 1>She's tied to a bunch of shady fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

957
00:45:16.310 --> 00:45:17.650
<v Speaker 1>That property stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

958
00:45:17.651 --> 00:45:22.240
<v Speaker 1>the Whitewater Shane from back in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that it's Arkansas,</v>

959
00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:23.460
<v Speaker 1>the Vince foster thing.</v>

960
00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:28.460
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of like weird shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the case with anybody that's </v>

961
00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:29.040
<v Speaker 1>involved in like high level politics </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>

962
00:45:29.050 --> 00:45:29.820
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's.</v>

963
00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:32.730
<v Speaker 1>They got some shit on you before you </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever even get in there.</v>

964
00:45:32.731 --> 00:45:36.900
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you don't get in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't be a politician to be clean.</v>

965
00:45:36.901 --> 00:45:38.430
<v Speaker 1>That's impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no way.</v>

966
00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:43.200
<v Speaker 1>You literally can't get to the highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>level where you're running for president</v>

967
00:45:43.201 --> 00:45:46.050
<v Speaker 1>unless you've been completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>compromised by special interest groups.</v>

968
00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:51.380
<v Speaker 1>That's the only way those cancer </v>
<v Speaker 1>campaign contributions are critical and </v>

969
00:45:51.380 --> 00:45:55.011
<v Speaker 1>you have to sit down with those fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporation owners and the CEOS and </v>

970
00:45:55.011 --> 00:45:59.331
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They figure out what the fuck is going </v>

971
00:45:59.331 --> 00:45:59.331
<v Speaker 1>to go down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how,</v>

972
00:45:59.331 --> 00:46:02.700
<v Speaker 1>how laws are going to be structured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what influence is going to get them.</v>

973
00:46:02.701 --> 00:46:05.160
<v Speaker 1>If this person gets into our office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't.</v>

974
00:46:05.190 --> 00:46:10.190
<v Speaker 1>They're not ambiguous about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now like maybe I can help you if I get </v>

975
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:13.341
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give me a million bucks and went back </v>

976
00:46:13.341 --> 00:46:13.341
<v Speaker 1>and help you.</v>

977
00:46:13.341 --> 00:46:15.710
<v Speaker 1>They know that this guy is going to make</v>
<v Speaker 1>either regulations more relaxed or </v>

978
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:20.421
<v Speaker 1>figuring out how to push things through </v>
<v Speaker 1>or figure out that that's what politics </v>

979
00:46:20.421 --> 00:46:20.700
<v Speaker 1>are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all money now,</v>

980
00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:26.040
<v Speaker 1>it's the whole ball of wax when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about like the amount of time that </v>

981
00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:29.661
<v Speaker 1>a guy actually spends campaigning and </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to raise money,</v>

982
00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:34.080
<v Speaker 1>like as opposed to how much time they </v>
<v Speaker 1>spend on actual work.</v>

983
00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:35.550
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's astounding.</v>

984
00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:41.390
<v Speaker 1>Campaign is all about raising money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take their whole thing is about </v>

985
00:46:41.390 --> 00:46:41.820
<v Speaker 1>raising money and occasionally giving </v>
<v Speaker 1>speeches.</v>

986
00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:42.930
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

987
00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:45.720
<v Speaker 1>It's just whoever gets the most money </v>
<v Speaker 1>wins,</v>

988
00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:51.260
<v Speaker 1>Donnelly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That you would have to have some insane </v>

989
00:46:51.260 --> 00:46:52.950
<v Speaker 1>amount of money spent just to try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it into those debates.</v>

990
00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:58.400
<v Speaker 1>Just to try to get into the baits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the commission for presidential </v>

991
00:46:58.400 --> 00:46:59.460
<v Speaker 1>debates is a privately owned </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporation,</v>

992
00:46:59.910 --> 00:47:04.560
<v Speaker 1>are privately owned institution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you can't just get in the debate.</v>

993
00:47:04.561 --> 00:47:05.310
<v Speaker 1>You can't say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

994
00:47:05.311 --> 00:47:10.311
<v Speaker 1>I'm Dean del Rey and I've got some </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty good ideas and I'd like to run </v>

995
00:47:10.311 --> 00:47:10.311
<v Speaker 1>for president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

996
00:47:10.311 --> 00:47:13.970
<v Speaker 1>you have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to get more than I believe 15 </v>

997
00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:17.001
<v Speaker 1>percent on five different polls and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>the polls that day choose like they can.</v>

998
00:47:17.430 --> 00:47:20.940
<v Speaker 1>They can cherry pick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like say if you're a guy like Ross Perot</v>

999
00:47:20.941 --> 00:47:22.680
<v Speaker 1>type guy that might fuck things up for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1000
00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:28.250
<v Speaker 1>They didn't anticipate that when Ross </v>
<v Speaker 1>Perot came around and he spent a </v>

1001
00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:29.010
<v Speaker 1>shitload of his own money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to run for president,</v>

1002
00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:30.390
<v Speaker 1>ruined all their plans</v>

1003
00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:36.360
<v Speaker 4>right away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Afterwards they monkeyed with the </v>

1004
00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:38.761
<v Speaker 4>numbers and change things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It made it even more difficult for an </v>

1005
00:47:38.761 --> 00:47:39.880
<v Speaker 4>independent person to debate and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>presidential elections.</v>

1006
00:47:40.150 --> 00:47:42.490
<v Speaker 4>So to the average American,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's only two choices.</v>

1007
00:47:42.491 --> 00:47:45.100
<v Speaker 4>You see those two assholes on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on television.</v>

1008
00:47:45.250 --> 00:47:48.250
<v Speaker 4>You have your Republican debates and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>have your democratic debates,</v>

1009
00:47:48.251 --> 00:47:51.190
<v Speaker 4>and then when it breaks down to those </v>
<v Speaker 4>two guys,</v>

1010
00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:53.650
<v Speaker 4>those are the only two people running </v>
<v Speaker 4>for president as far as you know,</v>

1011
00:47:54.460 --> 00:47:56.740
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a broken system.</v>

1012
00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:59.020
<v Speaker 4>Like I'm 49.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How old are you?</v>

1013
00:47:59.350 --> 00:48:01.120
<v Speaker 4>40 seven.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll be 48 in August.</v>

1014
00:48:01.570 --> 00:48:04.420
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember a good president?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1015
00:48:04.421 --> 00:48:07.390
<v Speaker 4>will clam was good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People liked Clinton until he got caught</v>

1016
00:48:08.290 --> 00:48:10.520
<v Speaker 4>getting a blowjob.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Carter Carter man,</v>

1017
00:48:10.690 --> 00:48:14.460
<v Speaker 4>Carter Sweetie.</v>

1018
00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:16.000
<v Speaker 4>Elvis on the roof.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's cool.</v>

1019
00:48:16.090 --> 00:48:18.160
<v Speaker 4>Did he had the White House?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what they say.</v>

1020
00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:19.240
<v Speaker 4>Know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never heard that.</v>

<v Speaker 4>telephone works.</v>

1040
00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:23.080
<v Speaker 4>It was like shipped Carter's Jimmy </v>
<v Speaker 4>Carter's son.</v>

1041
00:49:23.081 --> 00:49:24.610
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It must be right.</v>

1042
00:49:25.180 --> 00:49:27.520
<v Speaker 4>That's not the one that shipped Carter </v>
<v Speaker 4>running.</v>

1043
00:49:27.521 --> 00:49:29.960
<v Speaker 4>What's he doing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man?</v>

1044
00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:35.410
<v Speaker 4>Because his brother had belly beer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Billy Carter was a mess and Clinton have</v>

1045
00:49:35.411 --> 00:49:38.440
<v Speaker 4>a fucking mess of a brother too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember the mess of a brother.</v>

1046
00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:39.600
<v Speaker 4>Kai.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's great.</v>

1047
00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:42.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The mess,</v>

1048
00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:44.830
<v Speaker 4>brother.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That almost ruins it for everybody.</v>

1049
00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:47.980
<v Speaker 4>Smoked any of the Willie weed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got his own weed.</v>

1050
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.880
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1051
00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:50.830
<v Speaker 4>Everyone has.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everyone has a skin diamond.</v>

1052
00:49:50.831 --> 00:49:55.831
<v Speaker 4>Has her own leader.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just like four different strains named </v>

1053
00:49:55.831 --> 00:49:56.260
<v Speaker 4>after me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had one of them.</v>

1054
00:49:57.210 --> 00:49:58.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This.</v>

1055
00:49:58.930 --> 00:50:01.510
<v Speaker 4>You can't look whatever the Willie </v>
<v Speaker 4>Nelson weed is.</v>

1056
00:50:01.511 --> 00:50:02.650
<v Speaker 4>He probably has nothing to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1057
00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:04.420
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just they're paying him.</v>

1058
00:50:04.930 --> 00:50:08.110
<v Speaker 4>Jimmy Carter was one of the guys that I </v>
<v Speaker 4>was.</v>

1059
00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:12.430
<v Speaker 4>I remember being young and listening to </v>
<v Speaker 4>them talk and I believed him.</v>

1060
00:50:12.690 --> 00:50:15.490
<v Speaker 4>She was sincere in a way that a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>these guys just don't.</v>

1061
00:50:15.940 --> 00:50:17.860
<v Speaker 4>Some guys just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They seemed so phony.</v>

1062
00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:23.160
<v Speaker 4>Carter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whether or not you agree with them or </v>

1063
00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:24.781
<v Speaker 4>disagree with him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He seemed sincere and then it always </v>

1064
00:50:24.781 --> 00:50:28.621
<v Speaker 4>bugged me that the Republicans had </v>
<v Speaker 4>negotiated to release the hostages in </v>

1065
00:50:29.631 --> 00:50:33.170
<v Speaker 4>Iran after Reagan was in office,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they had.</v>

1066
00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:38.410
<v Speaker 4>They had made it a part of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>negotiation to not release those people </v>

1067
00:50:38.410 --> 00:50:39.350
<v Speaker 4>to make them look.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can hear right,</v>

1068
00:50:39.380 --> 00:50:44.380
<v Speaker 4>but that that means that those people </v>
<v Speaker 4>had to stay prisoner longer just for </v>

1069
00:50:45.051 --> 00:50:46.190
<v Speaker 4>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1070
00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:49.730
<v Speaker 4>I mean the Republicans at the time </v>
<v Speaker 4>should have been shunned just for that.</v>

1071
00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:52.100
<v Speaker 4>Someone should have pointed that out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If they could prove it,</v>

1072
00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:55.360
<v Speaker 4>that's if that was true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if that is true though.</v>

1073
00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:58.960
<v Speaker 4>That might be one of those sessions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Be Carter on the roof with Elvis.</v>

1074
00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:06.040
<v Speaker 4>Carolyn with Andrew.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's actually Maroon five doing when you</v>

1075
00:51:06.450 --> 00:51:11.450
<v Speaker 4>remember those gas wars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe Green Day with the odd and even </v>

1076
00:51:11.450 --> 00:51:12.590
<v Speaker 4>plates.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could only buy gas every other day.</v>

1077
00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:17.430
<v Speaker 4>Whatever your last number on your </v>
<v Speaker 4>license plate was because the kids don't</v>

1078
00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:19.550
<v Speaker 4>remember that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was crazy out here.</v>

1079
00:51:19.551 --> 00:51:20.330
<v Speaker 4>Are We?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

1080
00:51:20.331 --> 00:51:21.890
<v Speaker 4>Where'd you grow up?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was the east coast.</v>

1081
00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:25.240
<v Speaker 4>It was in California.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't even play.</v>

1082
00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:30.580
<v Speaker 4>I thought it was across the nation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you could only buy gas on every </v>

1083
00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:33.740
<v Speaker 4>other day if whatever your last number </v>
<v Speaker 4>on your license plate was.</v>

1084
00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:37.190
<v Speaker 4>Task Wars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It makes no sense at all.</v>

1085
00:51:37.191 --> 00:51:40.730
<v Speaker 4>What if you just happen to run out of </v>
<v Speaker 4>gas so you couldn't do anything?</v>

1086
00:51:40.810 --> 00:51:42.080
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was during that whole.</v>

1087
00:51:42.190 --> 00:51:47.190
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was the one who started making </v>

1088
00:51:47.190 --> 00:51:48.371
<v Speaker 4>those really economical car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it was when they were trying to </v>

1090
00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:50.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they were trying.</v>

1091
00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:52.830
<v Speaker 4>That's when cars turned to shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

1092
00:51:52.831 --> 00:51:56.480
<v Speaker 4>When cars went from being these awesome </v>
<v Speaker 4>beasts to these dog shit.</v>

<v Speaker 4>dropoff of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of American cars ever.</v>

1129
00:53:43.170 --> 00:53:48.170
<v Speaker 4>Better.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something about them like a 69 </v>

1130
00:53:48.170 --> 00:53:48.170
<v Speaker 4>Camaro.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's something about.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I had to have a man at the console and </v>

1137
00:54:06.151 --> 00:54:08.850
<v Speaker 4>eight track player man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those cars,</v>

1138
00:54:09.420 --> 00:54:14.420
<v Speaker 4>they just nailed it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They nailed it for between 65 and it's </v>

1139
00:54:14.420 --> 00:54:18.050
<v Speaker 4>tough to go after [inaudible] 73 now.</v>

00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:23.120
<v Speaker 4>73,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but everything else,</v>

<v Speaker 4>That was the end.</v>

1143
00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:25.200
<v Speaker 4>And the cars had already lost their </v>
<v Speaker 4>power.</v>

1144
00:54:25.650 --> 00:54:28.450
<v Speaker 4>They were already like butchering the </v>
<v Speaker 4>power on them yet,</v>

1145

00:54:49.850 --> 00:54:54.660
<v Speaker 4>but by the time 70 rolled around the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Kuda was just getting started as </v>

1153
00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:57.200

<v Speaker 4>was and it was shorter and funky.</v>

1155
00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:07.520
<v Speaker 4>Then they dumped the era and make it </v>
<v Speaker 4>longer or they make a big body and it's </v>

1156
00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:08.670
<v Speaker 4>killer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they only nailed it for three years.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Can you imagine that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They wouldn't.</v>

1267
00:59:57.640 --> 01:00:01.550
<v Speaker 3>love it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Check this out because this right now is</v>

1268
01:00:01.590 --> 01:00:06.590
<v Speaker 3>a new car the corvette has created.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is as fast as a lot of cars that </v>

1269
01:00:07.371 --> 01:00:09.280
<v Speaker 3>cost a million bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1270
01:00:10.930 --> 01:00:12.440
<v Speaker 3>This is an insane car.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1271
01:00:12.441 --> 01:00:15.550
<v Speaker 3>you'd probably have to spend a million </v>
<v Speaker 3>bucks to beat it at this.</v>

1272
01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:17.530
<v Speaker 3>Go to the blue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the beef.</v>

1273
01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:22.680
<v Speaker 3>I love the next one over right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The light bulb got you.</v>

1274
01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:25.550
<v Speaker 3>Don't like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Start drinking again.</v>

1275
01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:31.040
<v Speaker 3>Know it's pretty dope.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The actual car itself and the little </v>

1276
01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:31.040
<v Speaker 3>swatch looks gross.</v>

1277
01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:31.340
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1278
01:00:31.341 --> 01:00:31.950
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

1279
01:00:31.951 --> 01:00:36.951
<v Speaker 3>Thomas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But pull up a video of one of these </v>

1280
01:00:36.951 --> 01:00:39.290
<v Speaker 3>because once you see it in action,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's where it's ridiculous that this </v>

1281
01:00:39.290 --> 01:00:42.230
<v Speaker 3>is a 600 horsepower race car that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can buy straight from the factory.</v>

1282
01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:45.590
<v Speaker 3>It's less than $80,000.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1283
01:00:45.650 --> 01:00:50.650
<v Speaker 3>I mean you can get one stripped out for </v>
<v Speaker 3>like 80 grand and it'll burry like most </v>

1284
01:00:51.590 --> 01:00:54.230
<v Speaker 3>really high end sports cars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's insane.</v>

1285
01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:55.720
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>

1286
01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:57.350
<v Speaker 3>This is the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the race version.</v>

1287
01:00:57.351 --> 01:01:00.830
<v Speaker 3>You're looking at Jamie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the development of the race,</v>

1288
01:01:01.070 --> 01:01:03.710
<v Speaker 3>the actual race version,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a youtube video,</v>

1289
01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:08.480
<v Speaker 3>and you can see a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's racing one on the garage.</v>

1290
01:01:08.481 --> 01:01:09.560
<v Speaker 3>Go to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Was Raj?</v>

1291
01:01:09.860 --> 01:01:11.780
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>

1292
01:01:11.781 --> 01:01:12.370
<v Speaker 3>Right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1293
01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:14.300
<v Speaker 3>because it'll get us band.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

1294
01:01:14.301 --> 01:01:16.820
<v Speaker 3>We'll just watch it without showing it </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the rest of the world.</v>

1295
01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:18.770
<v Speaker 3>But these a liquid.</v>

1296
01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:23.240
<v Speaker 3>Well they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is the problem with this car though</v>

1297
01:01:23.270 --> 01:01:28.270
<v Speaker 3>that bums me out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is that they're making this thing with </v>

1298
01:01:28.270 --> 01:01:29.130
<v Speaker 3>an automatic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The old zero six in the car.</v>

1299
01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:31.430
<v Speaker 3>One.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only way you could get it was it had</v>

1300
01:01:31.431 --> 01:01:33.640
<v Speaker 3>to be a stick shift.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I left the car.</v>

1301
01:01:33.670 --> 01:01:38.670
<v Speaker 3>One fucking man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember that one day maybe shifting or </v>

1302
01:01:38.670 --> 01:01:39.410
<v Speaker 3>even a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A woman is exciting.</v>

1303
01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:42.340
<v Speaker 3>They made one like five years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>

1304
01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:47.270
<v Speaker 3>It was blue with the glass top and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>only made like 50 of them and that thing</v>

1305
01:01:47.271 --> 01:01:49.320
<v Speaker 3>was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like no,</v>

1306
01:01:49.590 --> 01:01:52.130
<v Speaker 3>been around for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They've made it for a long time,</v>

1307
01:01:52.131 --> 01:01:57.131
<v Speaker 3>but it was only available in a stick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>J Dot Lana would never buy it in </v>

1308
01:01:57.131 --> 01:01:58.040
<v Speaker 3>anything other than a stick because he's</v>
<v Speaker 3>a fucking man.</v>

1309
01:01:58.160 --> 01:01:59.300
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>at the garage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you know it's.</v>

1318
01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:24.880
<v Speaker 3>Once he stopped,</v>

<v Speaker 3>the middle of his head that he started </v>

1320
01:02:29.900 --> 01:02:31.520
<v Speaker 3>freaking out and he wasn't totally great</v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

1399
01:06:39.030 --> 01:06:40.620
<v Speaker 4>You can't even see down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1400
01:06:40.621 --> 01:06:42.810
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was on my bike.</v>

1401
01:06:43.070 --> 01:06:45.690
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is scary as shit in echo park,</v>

1402
01:06:45.930 --> 01:06:48.240
<v Speaker 4>three hills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never been there ever.</v>

1403
01:06:48.690 --> 01:06:53.690
<v Speaker 4>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always find it hilarious when you see </v>

1404
01:06:53.690 --> 01:06:56.181
<v Speaker 4>those houses in San Francisco that </v>
<v Speaker 4>literally have to be smushed up next to </v>

1405
01:06:56.181 --> 01:07:00.351
<v Speaker 4>each other because they're both leaning </v>
<v Speaker 4>sideways on this fucking hill trying to </v>

1406
01:07:00.351 --> 01:07:04.041
<v Speaker 4>stay straight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>connected each other and like the hill </v>

1407
01:07:04.041 --> 01:07:06.120
<v Speaker 4>is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then the bottom of the houses,</v>

1408
01:07:06.121 --> 01:07:11.121
<v Speaker 4>it's like a triangle to wedge it in as </v>
<v Speaker 4>like when you look at the actual frame </v>

1409
01:07:11.121 --> 01:07:14.670
<v Speaker 4>of the house and the way the foundation </v>
<v Speaker 4>is wedged into the hill,</v>

1410
01:07:14.671 --> 01:07:15.900
<v Speaker 4>you'll like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is ridiculous.</v>

1411
01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:20.900
<v Speaker 4>Can you imagine building those crazy </v>
<v Speaker 4>like no one's going to buy these and </v>

1412
01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:25.221
<v Speaker 4>they all sell.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then the other problem is if one of </v>

1413
01:07:25.221 --> 01:07:25.221
<v Speaker 4>them catches on fire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>done,</v>

1414
01:07:25.221 --> 01:07:28.140
<v Speaker 4>it goes right through all the houses </v>
<v Speaker 4>because these fucking assholes are glued</v>

1415
01:07:28.141 --> 01:07:29.220
<v Speaker 4>next to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1416
01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:30.990
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

<v Speaker 4>San Francisco has some bad fires.</v>

1418
01:07:33.290 --> 01:07:35.820
<v Speaker 4>They got a history of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that 89 earthquake,</v>

1419
01:07:35.821 --> 01:07:36.860
<v Speaker 4>the entire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1420
01:07:36.990 --> 01:07:39.420
<v Speaker 4>marina burned down to the ground because</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

1421
01:07:39.421 --> 01:07:41.520
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was built on landfill sand.</v>

1422
01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:46.940
<v Speaker 4>And then the shit start,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the earth moved and the house is sunk </v>

1423
01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:51.251
<v Speaker 4>and the gas lines cracked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the whole thing went up in flames </v>

1424
01:07:51.251 --> 01:07:52.960
<v Speaker 4>that took like a day to just put out the</v>
<v Speaker 4>fire.</v>

1425
01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:55.020
<v Speaker 4>So that whole place was burning to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ground.</v>

1426
01:07:55.021 --> 01:07:56.580
<v Speaker 4>Eighty nine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine what that looked like.</v>

1427
01:07:56.810 --> 01:08:01.810
<v Speaker 4>A forced CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine whole cnn back then they did on </v>

1428
01:08:02.690 --> 01:08:05.790
<v Speaker 4>the bay bridge over and over when it </v>
<v Speaker 4>drops down.</v>

1429
01:08:05.791 --> 01:08:06.840
<v Speaker 4>And the car falls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1431
01:08:09.030 --> 01:08:11.340
<v Speaker 4>from Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's where I was like,</v>

1432
01:08:11.341 --> 01:08:14.520
<v Speaker 4>Fuck California before I moved here.</v>

1433
01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:20.260
<v Speaker 2>It felt like an actual.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't a quake where you're like,</v>

1434
01:08:20.261 --> 01:08:22.630

1435
01:08:22.850 --> 01:08:25.520
<v Speaker 2>It was more like waves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I can.</v>

1436
01:08:25.540 --> 01:08:29.260
<v Speaker 2>I was watching the 89 world series.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was giants a's.</v>

1437
01:08:29.261 --> 01:08:30.720
<v Speaker 2>First time ever.</v>

1438
01:08:30.730 --> 01:08:34.330
<v Speaker 2>this could be great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bay Bay Bridge World series.</v>

1439
01:08:34.690 --> 01:08:38.510
<v Speaker 2>And I come out in the living room and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fucking four's going like this,</v>

1441
01:08:39.761 --> 01:08:41.500

<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she was on the top.</v>

1446
01:08:56.151 --> 01:08:58.490
<v Speaker 3>And then the thing dropped and she went </v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

<v Speaker 3>construction costs.</v>

<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1451
01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:12.440
<v Speaker 3>No.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The down part is.</v>

1452
01:09:12.530 --> 01:09:15.520
<v Speaker 3>That's the first part.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh no,</v>

1453
01:09:15.530 --> 01:09:16.500
<v Speaker 3>that's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1454
01:09:16.501 --> 01:09:19.070

<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>

1458
01:09:24.150 --> 01:09:27.950
<v Speaker 3>It's an intention.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like Super Art Deco.</v>

1459
01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:32.210
<v Speaker 3>When I lived in San Francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I lived there from age seven to 11.</v>

1460
01:09:32.211 --> 01:09:37.211
<v Speaker 3>I experienced the tiniest little baby </v>
<v Speaker 3>earthquake were the windows rattled and </v>

1461
01:09:37.211 --> 01:09:38.060
<v Speaker 3>I freaked out because it was a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>kid.</v>

1462
01:09:38.110 --> 01:09:40.830
<v Speaker 3>He was there as a kid from seven to 11.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

1463
01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:43.370
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What were your parents down there?</v>

1464
01:09:43.490 --> 01:09:48.490
<v Speaker 3>My Dad was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My stepdad when I was a kid was a </v>

1465
01:09:48.490 --> 01:09:49.520
<v Speaker 3>computer programmer and then you want to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be an architect.</v>

1466
01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:54.230
<v Speaker 3>So we moved from New Jersey to </v>
<v Speaker 3>California and lived in San Francisco.</v>

1467
01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:55.850
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For those five years.</v>

1468
01:09:56.300 --> 01:09:58.250
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when,</v>

1469
01:09:58.251 --> 01:10:03.251
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when I was here I was always scared of </v>

1470
01:10:03.251 --> 01:10:03.251
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that one little one,</v>

1471
01:10:03.251 --> 01:10:06.941
<v Speaker 3>it was just a little baby one just north</v>
<v Speaker 3>of route on the windows and I remember </v>

1472
01:10:06.941 --> 01:10:06.941
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

1473
01:10:06.941 --> 01:10:10.390
<v Speaker 3>just this feeling of helplessness and </v>
<v Speaker 3>weirdness and then I didn't experience </v>

1474
01:10:10.390 --> 01:10:14.441
<v Speaker 3>an actual one and even that was a baby </v>
<v Speaker 3>one until 94.</v>

1475
01:10:14.961 --> 01:10:19.220
<v Speaker 3>I was here after the big earthquake and </v>
<v Speaker 3>experienced some aftershocks where I was</v>

1476
01:10:19.221 --> 01:10:20.870
<v Speaker 3>in a shitty apartment in north </v>
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood.</v>

1477
01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:22.820
<v Speaker 3>And I remember the feeling that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1478
01:10:22.821 --> 01:10:26.240
<v Speaker 3>those refrigerator boxes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like someone will buy a refrigerator and</v>

1479
01:10:26.241 --> 01:10:27.900
<v Speaker 3>then the kids would play in the box and </v>
<v Speaker 3>so on.</v>

1480
01:10:28.010 --> 01:10:30.010
<v Speaker 3>But you know how the box like it would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

1481
01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:32.930
<v Speaker 3>it would just move like really weekly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could push it back and forth.</v>

1482
01:10:33.170 --> 01:10:35.720
<v Speaker 3>That's what the department felt like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It felt like a refrigerator box.</v>

1483
01:10:35.721 --> 01:10:40.721
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is crazy because I was in north </v>

1484
01:10:40.721 --> 01:10:40.721
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which isn't too far from North Ridge.</v>

1485
01:10:40.721 --> 01:10:41.510
<v Speaker 3>That was the epicenter,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1486
01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:42.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

1487
01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:47.630
<v Speaker 3>this shitty apartment that I was in was </v>
<v Speaker 3>just made out a fucking hopes and dreams</v>

1488
01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:52.680
<v Speaker 3>and sliding back and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then I've experienced a couple that </v>

1489
01:10:53.391 --> 01:10:55.200
<v Speaker 3>are similar to that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like five and a half,</v>

1490
01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:57.050
<v Speaker 3>five point four years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

1491
01:10:57.410 --> 01:11:02.410
<v Speaker 3>But I've never experienced a real one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The real ones are supposed to be life </v>

1492
01:11:02.410 --> 01:11:02.870
<v Speaker 3>changing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you see that movie yet?</v>

1493
01:11:03.170 --> 01:11:05.090
<v Speaker 3>I saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I love the Rock,</v>

1494
01:11:05.091 --> 01:11:10.091
<v Speaker 3>but I'm not going to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Life is precious that they're trying to </v>

1495
01:11:10.091 --> 01:11:11.540

1576
01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:21.440
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nor cal,</v>

1577
01:15:21.441 --> 01:15:24.380
<v Speaker 2>when they started growing that kill or </v>
<v Speaker 2>those cola buds,</v>

1578
01:15:24.410 --> 01:15:29.410
<v Speaker 2>there was no seeds and that shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just giant Koala buds and </v>

1579
01:15:29.410 --> 01:15:29.420
<v Speaker 2>everybody's like,</v>

<v Speaker 2>indicus here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The new weed off</v>

1581
01:15:32.170 --> 01:15:37.170
<v Speaker 1>we'll out of figure out was how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>genetically like not engineer with like </v>

1582
01:15:37.800 --> 01:15:39.960
<v Speaker 1>chemicals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but splicing and using.</v>

1583
01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:42.790
<v Speaker 1>Once those gaps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those botanists got ahold of weed.</v>

1584
01:15:43.030 --> 01:15:48.030
<v Speaker 1>That's when Shit got interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All they needed was just enough </v>

1585
01:15:48.030 --> 01:15:48.460
<v Speaker 1>comfortable space where they didn't feel</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they were gonna go to jail.</v>

1586
01:15:48.650 --> 01:15:50.970
<v Speaker 1>Just give them enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Humboldt was like,</v>

1587
01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:54.070
<v Speaker 1>where a lot of that stuff came from </v>
<v Speaker 1>because like that whole economy up there</v>

1588
01:15:54.071 --> 01:15:54.940
<v Speaker 1>is based on weed.</v>

1589
01:15:54.980 --> 01:15:59.980
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tell her I say the Emerald Triangle </v>

1590
01:15:59.980 --> 01:15:59.980
<v Speaker 2>documentary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's unbelievable.</v>

1591
01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:03.251
<v Speaker 2>I haven't seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know a lot of people grow up </v>

1592
01:16:03.251 --> 01:16:03.251
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1593
01:16:03.251 --> 01:16:03.330
<v Speaker 2>me too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like without that,</v>

1594
01:16:03.331 --> 01:16:05.090
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that whole area has gone.</v>

1595
01:16:05.410 --> 01:16:07.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what's weird because logging went</v>

1596
01:16:07.661 --> 01:16:11.020
<v Speaker 1>away and a lot of those guys actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>voted against legalization,</v>

1597
01:16:11.290 --> 01:16:13.300
<v Speaker 1>which is really fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1598
01:16:13.310 --> 01:16:15.550
<v Speaker 1>Because they want the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would butcher the prices.</v>

1599
01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:17.480
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it was,</v>

1600
01:16:17.481 --> 01:16:19.690
<v Speaker 1>it was easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1601
01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:22.570
<v Speaker 1>if it was easy to grow and nobody had </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever run any risk,</v>

1602
01:16:22.571 --> 01:16:24.880
<v Speaker 1>then it wouldn't be worth it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're out of business.</v>

1603
01:16:24.881 --> 01:16:26.500
<v Speaker 1>It's not fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pat Is fucked.</v>

1604
01:16:26.590 --> 01:16:31.590
<v Speaker 1>They also voted against like the one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the doctors that I've been to for </v>

1605
01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:36.650
<v Speaker 1>recommendations for prescriptions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he told me that like,</v>

1606
01:16:36.670 --> 01:16:37.960
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite honestly,</v>

1607
01:16:37.961 --> 01:16:42.961
<v Speaker 1>I know doctors that are voting against </v>
<v Speaker 1>legalization because they want to keep </v>

1608
01:16:42.961 --> 01:16:44.260
<v Speaker 1>it medical because you've got to keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to the doctor every year and pay a</v>

1609
01:16:44.261 --> 01:16:46.360
<v Speaker 1>fee in order to get your license </v>
<v Speaker 1>renewed.</v>

1610

1616
01:16:57.211 --> 01:16:57.211

01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:15.120
<v Speaker 4>ain't no fucking motorcycle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have a navigation system on your </v>

1624
01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:15.120
<v Speaker 4>motorcycle?</v>

<v Speaker 4>they have,</v>

1629
01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:28.490
<v Speaker 4>but I feel like a motorcycle should be a</v>
<v Speaker 4>motorcycle.</v>

1630
01:17:28.620 --> 01:17:31.190
<v Speaker 4>You feel like you should see fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>gauge cluster.</v>

1631
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:32.760
<v Speaker 4>And that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what I got.</v>

1632
01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:36.230
<v Speaker 4>When I see the phone ringing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's Bluetooth into your motorcycle.</v>

1633
01:17:36.231 --> 01:17:36.940
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ooh,</v>

01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:48.600
<v Speaker 4>like Stereo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you just turned on like 10 and </v>

1638
01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:49.940
<v Speaker 4>you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you're just blasting Zeplin.</v>

1639
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:54.350
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've seen this heads up display that's</v>

1640
01:17:54.351 --> 01:17:58.820
<v Speaker 4>going to go right into your eye.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That will gouge out your brain.</v>

1641
01:17:58.830 --> 01:18:03.830
<v Speaker 4>That's a stupid one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a better one where it's up in </v>

1642
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:03.830
<v Speaker 4>here.</v>

1643
01:18:03.830 --> 01:18:06.270
<v Speaker 4>It's just like right here and you don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>see it and you can see behind you.</v>

1644
01:18:06.710 --> 01:18:08.470
<v Speaker 4>That is a big risk that guys.</v>

<v Speaker 4>putting that metal square by inches from</v>

1646
01:18:13.101 --> 01:18:18.101
<v Speaker 4>his eyes that that's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Knowing that he's going to be crashing </v>

1647
01:18:18.101 --> 01:18:21.581
<v Speaker 4>that bike,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the great likelihood at least once in </v>

<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1650
01:18:24.021 --> 01:18:29.021
<v Speaker 4>I always talk about people like there's </v>
<v Speaker 4>two things I hate when you're riding the</v>

<v Speaker 4>you don't want to relive it with a </v>

1653

<v Speaker 4>stranger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

<v Speaker 4>let me just tell you about how bad I </v>
<v Speaker 4>crashed.</v>

1656
01:18:39.261 --> 01:18:43.400
<v Speaker 4>I've been trying to forget it and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>other one is I had one of those.</v>

1657
01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:48.760

<v Speaker 4>they had and they didn't have it in l </v>

1658

1660
01:18:51.340 --> 01:18:53.060
<v Speaker 4>It's just like those are the two things </v>
<v Speaker 4>I hate,</v>

1661
01:18:53.061 --> 01:18:55.310
<v Speaker 4>but no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>never crashed.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Those poor bastards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at you and get you out there and </v>

1663
01:19:02.330 --> 01:19:02.840
<v Speaker 4>living the dream.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I used to live the dream,</v>

1664
01:19:03.650 --> 01:19:08.650
<v Speaker 4>I used to go out there and risking at </v>
<v Speaker 4>feeding off the adrenaline ticket </v>

1665
01:19:08.650 --> 01:19:09.080
<v Speaker 4>chances,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cutting lanes.</v>

1666
01:19:09.520 --> 01:19:11.420
<v Speaker 4>I had some friends from Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 4>from Alberta,</v>

1667
01:19:11.450 --> 01:19:16.450
<v Speaker 4>and they had never been to California </v>
<v Speaker 4>before and they didn't know that you </v>

1668
01:19:16.450 --> 01:19:17.500
<v Speaker 4>were allowed to cut lanes and so these </v>
<v Speaker 4>people would drive.</v>

1669
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:19.250
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is going on?</v>

1670
01:19:19.251 --> 01:19:23.000
<v Speaker 4>These people are mania.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're flying by him with the highway.</v>

1671
01:19:23.001 --> 01:19:28.000
<v Speaker 4>They were freaking out because you can't</v>
<v Speaker 4>do that in Canada state.</v>

1672
01:19:28.190 --> 01:19:33.190
<v Speaker 4>It's a really new,</v>
<v Speaker 4>believe it only state is it really the </v>

1673
01:19:33.190 --> 01:19:36.911
<v Speaker 4>own fucking statement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they just pat where he passed it </v>

1674
01:19:36.911 --> 01:19:36.911
<v Speaker 4>like two weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's so crazy.</v>

1675
01:19:36.911 --> 01:19:39.160
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's such a bad law.</v>

1676
01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:40.610
<v Speaker 4>So horrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It sucked.</v>

1677
01:19:40.620 --> 01:19:42.380
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially with people texting.</v>

1678
01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:44.480
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get it for them.</v>

1679
01:19:44.570 --> 01:19:46.580
<v Speaker 4>It's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're stuck on the four or five.</v>

1680
01:19:46.581 --> 01:19:48.470
<v Speaker 4>Everybody else is dead and you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>moving.</v>

1681
01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:53.740
<v Speaker 4>That is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I totally get it from their point of </v>

1682
01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:53.740
<v Speaker 4>view,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but from a safety point of view,</v>

1683
01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:54.980
<v Speaker 4>how the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>First of all,</v>

1684
01:19:55.100 --> 01:20:00.100
<v Speaker 4>why do I have to wear a seatbelt if this</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude doesn't even have a fucking shell </v>

1685
01:20:00.100 --> 01:20:01.280
<v Speaker 4>on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's on a bike.</v>

1686
01:20:02.030 --> 01:20:07.030
<v Speaker 4>I have to have a seatbelt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This fucking guy is even surrounded by </v>

1687
01:20:07.030 --> 01:20:08.470
<v Speaker 4>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They just did a study</v>

1688
01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:13.590
<v Speaker 2>for two years straight and fanned out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Splitting lanes is safer than sitting in</v>

1689
01:20:13.591 --> 01:20:17.850
<v Speaker 2>traffic because the texters are crashing</v>
<v Speaker 2>into dudes.</v>

1690
01:20:17.910 --> 01:20:20.760
<v Speaker 2>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're just like texting and boom.</v>

1691
01:20:20.761 --> 01:20:25.761
<v Speaker 2>They hit the guy on the bike and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>also not illegal to do it in shorts.</v>

1692
01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:31.480
<v Speaker 2>How that's the dumbest fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you see people with a short sleeve </v>

1693
01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:35.121
<v Speaker 2>shirt on or no sleeves in shorts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how come I have to wear a seatbelt </v>

1694
01:20:35.121 --> 01:20:39.880
<v Speaker 2>or I'll tell you what.</v>

01:21:54.510 --> 01:21:57.030
<v Speaker 2>but it was rain and I go to sleep and </v>
<v Speaker 2>wake up.</v>

1725
01:21:57.030 --> 01:22:00.030
<v Speaker 2>The next day I wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks pretty clear.</v>

1726
01:22:00.450 --> 01:22:01.410
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get on the bike.</v>

1727
01:22:01.411 --> 01:22:06.411
<v Speaker 2>And as soon as I get out of San Diego by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the checkpoint there it starts fucking </v>

1728
01:22:07.560 --> 01:22:11.640
<v Speaker 2>pouring man like I hadn't seen in La and</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

1729
01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.370
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this is it man.</v>

1730
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:16.500
<v Speaker 2>I got a windshield,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1731
01:22:16.770 --> 01:22:21.770
<v Speaker 2>And I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just go because it's one of those </v>

1732
01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:25.551
<v Speaker 2>things where you're broke so you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well do I spend money on a motel six </v>

1733
01:22:25.551 --> 01:22:27.780
<v Speaker 2>here on the side of the highway or just </v>
<v Speaker 2>try to make it.</v>

1734
01:22:27.781 --> 01:22:32.781
<v Speaker 2>And I rolled with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it took me about three hours and it was </v>

1735
01:22:32.781 --> 01:22:37.761
<v Speaker 2>funny,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right when I got to Disneyland it </v>

1736
01:22:37.761 --> 01:22:37.890
<v Speaker 2>totally stopped raining and by the time </v>
<v Speaker 2>I was home I was completely dry.</v>

1737
01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:39.040
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1738
01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:44.080
<v Speaker 2>Because it was like sun out and you know</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's another 40 minutes on the bike </v>

1739
01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:45.090
<v Speaker 2>and the sun even bad.</v>

1740
01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:46.140
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that bad.</v>

1741
01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:50.220
<v Speaker 2>But it seems like that drive in the rain</v>
<v Speaker 2>is probably really fucking hard to see.</v>

1742
01:22:50.221 --> 01:22:51.330
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to see in.</v>

1743
01:22:51.340 --> 01:22:54.780
<v Speaker 2>It's super nerve racking because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>trucks are sprain.</v>

1744
01:22:55.070 --> 01:22:57.000
<v Speaker 2>Big Spray.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the trucks,</v>

1745
01:22:57.001 --> 01:23:02.001
<v Speaker 2>the 18 wheelers that are on the five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're spraying big time and you're </v>

1746
01:23:02.001 --> 01:23:02.001
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1747
01:23:02.001 --> 01:23:04.650
<v Speaker 2>fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're just trying to go wake far out</v>

1748
01:23:04.651 --> 01:23:05.630
<v Speaker 2>to the left.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Them.</v>

1749
01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:10.190
<v Speaker 2>It's potential wiping out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Must be really fucking keeping your,</v>

1750
01:23:10.350 --> 01:23:12.400
<v Speaker 2>your senses on the edge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

1751
01:23:12.490 --> 01:23:13.330
<v Speaker 2>Brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Joe.</v>

1752
01:23:13.331 --> 01:23:16.810
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you one time I had to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to do this Gig in Bakersfield,</v>

1753
01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:19.430
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like two years in and I was like,</v>

1754
01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:21.820
<v Speaker 2>I can't cancel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They won't ever booked me again.</v>

1755
01:23:22.090 --> 01:23:25.010
<v Speaker 2>And I wrote up the five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the grapevine.</v>

1756
01:23:25.060 --> 01:23:29.920
<v Speaker 2>It got to the top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was snowing like a light snow.</v>

1757
01:23:30.250 --> 01:23:31.930
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My thumb,</v>

1758
01:23:31.990 --> 01:23:36.160
<v Speaker 2>my right thumb was frozen to where I was</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1759
01:23:36.250 --> 01:23:37.420
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't get it anywhere.</v>

1760
01:23:37.420 --> 01:23:39.700
<v Speaker 2>Like my thumb was numb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

1761
01:23:39.790 --> 01:23:41.450
<v Speaker 2>you've frozen barehanded.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1762
01:23:41.470 --> 01:23:44.610
<v Speaker 2>I got gloves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you're going and your hand is tucked</v>

1763
01:23:44.611 --> 01:23:49.611
<v Speaker 2>here so you're cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the thumb was out like this and I </v>

1764
01:23:49.611 --> 01:23:50.890
<v Speaker 2>was going to fuck my right thumb is </v>
<v Speaker 2>frozen man.</v>

1765
01:23:50.891 --> 01:23:55.891
<v Speaker 2>I don't feel it's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I pull up in a truck stop and I was </v>

1766
01:23:55.891 --> 01:23:58.891
<v Speaker 2>drinking hot chocolates and I bought </v>
<v Speaker 2>some kids mittens and put them </v>

1767
01:23:59.081 --> 01:24:04.081
<v Speaker 2>underneath my glove.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I put these mittens on and then my </v>

1768
01:24:04.081 --> 01:24:06.240
<v Speaker 2>gloves and I get to the Gig and there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>like nine people there.</v>

1769
01:24:06.970 --> 01:24:09.640
<v Speaker 2>Nine people at a bar gig risked your </v>
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

1770
01:24:09.641 --> 01:24:10.660
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1771
01:24:10.661 --> 01:24:13.340
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was so mad.</v>

1772
01:24:13.450 --> 01:24:16.540
<v Speaker 2>And then I did 15 minutes and turned </v>
<v Speaker 2>around and rode home.</v>

1773
01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:19.600
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He also told me something.</v>

1774
01:24:19.601 --> 01:24:24.601
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know that when people flick </v>
<v Speaker 2>cigarettes out there that it actually </v>

1775
01:24:24.601 --> 01:24:26.090
<v Speaker 2>sometimes gets into motorcycles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like coats.</v>

1776
01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:29.860
<v Speaker 2>It had one go down my shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I almost crashed these people,</v>

1777
01:24:30.220 --> 01:24:34.780
<v Speaker 2>they flick cigarettes out all day long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all fucking day long.</v>

1778
01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:37.000
<v Speaker 2>And they don't even care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just boom.</v>

<v Speaker 2>traffic.</v>

1782
01:24:44.440 --> 01:24:45.660
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fight?</v>

<v Speaker 3>Just like the shape,</v>

1838
01:27:24.950 --> 01:27:26.240
<v Speaker 3>the sound,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the bullet,</v>

1839
01:27:26.270 --> 01:27:27.560
<v Speaker 3>everything about it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1840
01:27:27.561 --> 01:27:29.000
<v Speaker 3>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it's not too big.</v>

1841
01:27:29.001 --> 01:27:31.610
<v Speaker 3>It's not too small.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Know it just fires.</v>

1842
01:27:31.690 --> 01:27:34.360
<v Speaker 3>As far as handguns go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very easy gun to shoot at.</v>

1843
01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:37.700
<v Speaker 3>I have a glock nine millimeter shoots </v>
<v Speaker 3>like it's.</v>

1844
01:27:37.701 --> 01:27:38.510
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1845
01:27:38.750 --> 01:27:41.030
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I have a rifle,</v>

1846
01:27:41.070 --> 01:27:42.860
<v Speaker 3>the seven millimeter remington ultra </v>
<v Speaker 3>mag.</v>

1847
01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:46.700
<v Speaker 3>I have a 300 win mag,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two big kicking fucking elephant killing</v>

1848
01:27:46.701 --> 01:27:50.190
<v Speaker 3>guns.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bone digs into your shoulder like this.</v>

1849
01:27:50.191 --> 01:27:54.050
<v Speaker 3>It just is such a difference between a </v>
<v Speaker 3>rifle and a pistol.</v>

1850
01:27:54.140 --> 01:27:59.140
<v Speaker 3>Pistols like feel so small.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I feel like like if you were </v>

1851
01:27:59.140 --> 01:28:00.320
<v Speaker 3>hunting with a rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like sometimes people hunt with pistols.</v>

1852
01:28:00.450 --> 01:28:02.900
<v Speaker 3>If you're hunting with a rifle and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit something that thing's dead.</v>

1853
01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:06.080
<v Speaker 3>If you you're hunting with a pistol and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he hit something like,</v>

1854
01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:09.800
<v Speaker 3>Ooh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they might survive the shoot.</v>

1855
01:28:09.801 --> 01:28:14.120
<v Speaker 3>An elk with a nine millimeter and my </v>
<v Speaker 3>runaway hooker guns,</v>

1856
01:28:14.121 --> 01:28:17.340
<v Speaker 3>they keep in their bra.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You ever.</v>

1857
01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:19.910
<v Speaker 3>I love the Desert Eagle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>50 caliber.</v>

1858
01:28:20.210 --> 01:28:24.230
<v Speaker 3>Ridiculous gun you ever will see the </v>
<v Speaker 3>footage girls shooting the Desert Eagle.</v>

1859
01:28:24.290 --> 01:28:26.750
<v Speaker 3>That is so good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boom,</v>

1860
01:28:26.751 --> 01:28:30.100
<v Speaker 3>right into her hand was one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two or girls shooting and her,</v>

1861
01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:35.120
<v Speaker 3>her tits are exploding like as she </v>
<v Speaker 3>shooting like the recoils like boom or </v>

1862
01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:37.610
<v Speaker 3>taste like sugar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>

1863
01:28:37.611 --> 01:28:40.550
<v Speaker 3>I've seen the girl hit herself in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>head guy that video.</v>

1864
01:28:40.551 --> 01:28:45.551

<v Speaker 3>That person's rude.</v>

1866
01:28:46.190 --> 01:28:51.190
<v Speaker 3>Whoever gave that girl that gun.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck was going to happen in </v>

1867
01:28:51.411 --> 01:28:52.640
<v Speaker 3>your hand?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a canon.</v>

1868
01:28:52.860 --> 01:28:57.860
<v Speaker 3>We shot one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember Brian when we filmed my comedy </v>

1869
01:28:57.860 --> 01:29:00.050
<v Speaker 3>special down in Tempe in 2005,</v>

<v Speaker 4>We search out these ridiculous pistols.</v>

1876
01:29:13.350 --> 01:29:15.960
<v Speaker 4>They throw your hand back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You literally can't hold it straight.</v>

1877
01:29:16.050 --> 01:29:21.050
<v Speaker 4>You can't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the fire that comes out of it is </v>

1878
01:29:21.050 --> 01:29:23.630
<v Speaker 4>unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I grew up in the bay area and I just </v>

1879
01:29:23.630 --> 01:29:25.050
<v Speaker 4>love dirty Harry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I loved it.</v>

01:29:25.650 --> 01:29:30.650
<v Speaker 4>I loved those films and I just loved him</v>
<v Speaker 4>just to Canon like he represented a </v>

1881
01:29:31.321 --> 01:29:36.321
<v Speaker 4>weird part of San Francisco and that </v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't represented anywhere else in the </v>

1882
01:29:36.321 --> 01:29:40.191
<v Speaker 4>world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody has thought about San </v>

1883
01:29:40.191 --> 01:29:40.191
<v Speaker 4>Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They thought about gay people.</v>

1884
01:29:40.191 --> 01:29:40.590
<v Speaker 4>That was it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>San Francisco was gay people and hippies</v>

1885
01:29:40.950 --> 01:29:41.910
<v Speaker 4>and all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait a minute,</v>

1886
01:29:41.911 --> 01:29:45.150
<v Speaker 4>what is this guy doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he was a northern California guy.</v>

1887
01:29:45.151 --> 01:29:47.070
<v Speaker 4>I mean he was mayor of Carmel.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Even nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1890
01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:53.900
<v Speaker 4>Unbelievable runs for mayor wins.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Marries the local news caster.</v>

1891
01:29:54.570 --> 01:29:55.190
<v Speaker 4>He did?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1892
01:29:55.200 --> 01:29:56.800
<v Speaker 4>The chick was.</v>

<v Speaker 4>kinds of evil going on.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Who's evil going on?</v>
<v Speaker 4>My kid can't catch a break.</v>

1895
01:30:05.730 --> 01:30:10.730
<v Speaker 4>Just add to what a what a God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The secret was he was gay the whole </v>

1896
01:30:10.730 --> 01:30:11.730
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dirty Harry was actually gay.</v>

1897
01:30:11.770 --> 01:30:16.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like overcompensating big black </v>

1898
01:30:16.770 --> 01:30:20.750
<v Speaker 4>guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what dirty Harry was really all </v>

1899
01:30:20.750 --> 01:30:20.750
<v Speaker 4>about.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was all about him.</v>

1903
01:30:30.070 --> 01:30:35.070
<v Speaker 4>It was a different sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because like San Francisco was never </v>

1904
01:30:35.070 --> 01:30:36.360
<v Speaker 4>thought of as being like a crime </v>
<v Speaker 4>fighting town at all.</v>

1905
01:30:36.400 --> 01:30:37.950
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think in New York,</v>

1906
01:30:37.951 --> 01:30:42.951

<v Speaker 2>just rock.</v>

1953
01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:47.310
<v Speaker 2>Just rock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the one that got away.</v>

1954
01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:52.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she is the one that got check in with </v>

1955
01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:52.400
<v Speaker 2>her every now and again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I tried it.</v>

1956
01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:55.530
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't have anything for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did Davies Symphony Hall two weeks ago</v>

1957
01:32:55.531 --> 01:33:00.531
<v Speaker 2>in San Fran with Marin and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come down to the shell and just nothing </v>

1958
01:33:01.610 --> 01:33:04.650
<v Speaker 2>to no man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I know she got.</v>

1959
01:33:05.210 --> 01:33:06.240
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't.</v>

1960
01:33:06.690 --> 01:33:10.620
<v Speaker 2>She never got married either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I raised her par.</v>

1961
01:33:11.300 --> 01:33:14.490
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you just need to get together with</v>

1962
01:33:14.491 --> 01:33:16.470
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe I've tried it with a bow tie and a</v>

1963
01:33:16.471 --> 01:33:19.260
<v Speaker 2>bouquet of flowers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ty.</v>

1964
01:33:19.470 --> 01:33:23.810
<v Speaker 2>Come on like a wacky weather guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I love.</v>

1965
01:33:24.770 --> 01:33:29.770
<v Speaker 2>What I do better though is like I did </v>
<v Speaker 2>some movies and stuff and she didn't go </v>

1966
01:33:29.770 --> 01:33:29.770
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1967
01:33:29.770 --> 01:33:30.720
<v Speaker 2>he must be getting famous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm getting back.</v>

1968
01:33:30.721 --> 01:33:32.240
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She didn't do that.</v>

1969
01:33:32.430 --> 01:33:33.870
<v Speaker 2>That was cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's be honest.</v>

1970
01:33:33.871 --> 01:33:37.080
<v Speaker 2>We really didn't get famous but a person</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's normal</v>

1971
01:33:37.200 --> 01:33:39.720
<v Speaker 1>did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really did.</v>

1972
01:33:39.721 --> 01:33:41.140
<v Speaker 1>Maybe then she would,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1973
01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:42.630
<v Speaker 1>maybe then to like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hmm.</v>

1974
01:33:42.970 --> 01:33:43.680
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1975
01:33:44.850 --> 01:33:46.380
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one more chance.</v>

1976
01:33:46.920 --> 01:33:49.830
<v Speaker 1>But if you sell us out for rock and roll</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

1977
01:33:51.300 --> 01:33:55.320
<v Speaker 1>what was it about rock and roll?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just the hours being on the road.</v>

1978
01:33:55.330 --> 01:33:56.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's that.</v>

1979
01:33:56.440 --> 01:33:58.030
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like comedy.</v>

1980
01:33:58.031 --> 01:34:00.580
<v Speaker 2>I could never have a girlfriend now it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1981
01:34:00.581 --> 01:34:03.790
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I dedicate myself 100 percent.</v>

1982
01:34:03.791 --> 01:34:06.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm out seven nights a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't miss a night.</v>

1983
01:34:06.760 --> 01:34:07.840
<v Speaker 2>I can't wait.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Am I going to do.</v>

1984
01:34:07.841 --> 01:34:10.930
<v Speaker 2>Unless they're in the Biz and work and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then we can hang during the day.</v>

1985
01:34:11.170 --> 01:34:13.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard for people to win.</v>

1986
01:34:13.391 --> 01:34:18.391
<v Speaker 1>The worst thing is when a guy's talented</v>
<v Speaker 1>comic and he gets a girlfriend and she </v>

1987
01:34:18.391 --> 01:34:20.230
<v Speaker 1>doesn't like the lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he shifts.</v>

1988
01:34:20.290 --> 01:34:21.930
<v Speaker 1>I seen it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen it happen too.</v>

1989
01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:25.210
<v Speaker 1>And then you run into those guys 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years later when the girl had broken up,</v>

1990
01:34:25.211 --> 01:34:27.670
<v Speaker 1>but they want to try all over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's ugly.</v>

1991
01:34:27.910 --> 01:34:28.480
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1992
01:34:28.481 --> 01:34:30.460
<v Speaker 1>you missed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You missed the whole thing.</v>

1993
01:34:30.461 --> 01:34:32.560
<v Speaker 1>Like you're not a pro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you try to.</v>

1994
01:34:32.561 --> 01:34:37.561
<v Speaker 1>You do you want to become a pro again?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me had you had a chance at one point in </v>

1995
01:34:37.561 --> 01:34:37.561
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now you're fucked.</v>

1996
01:34:37.561 --> 01:34:38.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1997
01:34:38.281 --> 01:34:43.281
<v Speaker 2>I never wanted to hear this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you going to go out and again </v>

1998
01:34:43.281 --> 01:34:44.700
<v Speaker 2>tonight?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I get every night,</v>

1999
01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:45.720
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2000
01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:47.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the ceiling,</v>

2001
01:34:47.690 --> 01:34:50.870
<v Speaker 1>especially at 44 starting when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>really got to commit,</v>

2002
01:34:50.930 --> 01:34:54.200
<v Speaker 1>you've got to hit the ground running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't take a few slow years and half</v>

2003
01:34:54.201 --> 01:34:56.720
<v Speaker 1>asset and kind of get back in.</v>

2004
01:34:57.230 --> 01:34:58.220
<v Speaker 2>No Way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2005
01:34:58.220 --> 01:35:00.740
<v Speaker 1>Once I started I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

2006
01:35:00.741 --> 01:35:04.700
<v Speaker 1>this is hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it scary being 44 and like beginning</v>

2007
01:35:04.701 --> 01:35:06.950
<v Speaker 1>a new chapter in your life like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or was it exciting?</v>

2008
01:35:07.410 --> 01:35:11.060
<v Speaker 1>It was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't scary as far.</v>

2009
01:35:11.061 --> 01:35:12.210
<v Speaker 1>I loved it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2010
01:35:12.810 --> 01:35:14.360
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2012
01:35:16.371 --> 01:35:20.540

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2013
01:35:21.050 --> 01:35:22.940
<v Speaker 1>it costs a fortune.</v>

01:35:56.271 --> 01:36:01.271
<v Speaker 1>like you seen people crack jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never thought it was going to be easy </v>

2030
01:36:01.271 --> 01:36:04.600
<v Speaker 1>ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't think it was going to grab </v>

<v Speaker 1>and then I had a guy Shawn Carrigan from</v>

2067
01:37:41.361 --> 01:37:46.361
<v Speaker 1>a young and the restless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I have different kinds of guests and </v>

2068
01:37:46.361 --> 01:37:47.150
<v Speaker 1>it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we'd take skype calls and uh,</v>

2069
01:37:47.510 --> 01:37:52.510
<v Speaker 1>and regular calls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's when I first did tom shows like </v>

2070
01:37:52.510 --> 01:37:55.751
<v Speaker 1>when the first time Brian and I had </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought about doing something and then </v>

2071
01:37:55.751 --> 01:37:56.790
<v Speaker 1>when he had that set up in living room </v>
<v Speaker 1>where he was like,</v>

2072
01:37:56.970 --> 01:38:01.970
<v Speaker 1>it was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had his own server room with all </v>

2073
01:38:01.970 --> 01:38:03.270
<v Speaker 1>these server set up and these crazy </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking lines.</v>

2074
01:38:03.271 --> 01:38:05.520
<v Speaker 1>And we were trying to figure out like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Brian,</v>

2075
01:38:05.550 --> 01:38:06.890
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the thing for Brunswick,</v>

2076
01:38:06.970 --> 01:38:07.830
<v Speaker 1>you don't need all of this.</v>

2077
01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:14.940
<v Speaker 1>Essentially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like his own aol.</v>

2078
01:38:14.941 --> 01:38:16.420
<v Speaker 1>We were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is going on here?</v>

2079
01:38:16.470 --> 01:38:17.890
<v Speaker 1>It seems like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2080
01:38:17.930 --> 01:38:20.160
<v Speaker 1>And they were doing it with a company </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of Denver,</v>

2081
01:38:20.161 --> 01:38:25.161
<v Speaker 1>you remember?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the company out of Denver wanted to </v>

2082
01:38:25.161 --> 01:38:25.161
<v Speaker 1>do something with me and we talked about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2083
01:38:25.161 --> 01:38:25.161
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

2084
01:38:25.161 --> 01:38:27.510
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What exactly are you doing?</v>

2085
01:38:27.530 --> 01:38:32.530
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are you doing this like this and </v>

2086
01:38:32.530 --> 01:38:32.530
<v Speaker 1>that's why we started fucking around </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Justin Dot TV too.</v>

2087
01:38:33.030 --> 01:38:38.030
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had thought about doing some other </v>

2088
01:38:38.030 --> 01:38:38.160
<v Speaker 1>sort of streaming version of one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these things,</v>

2089
01:38:38.161 --> 01:38:42.360
<v Speaker 1>but Tom Green had gone balls out from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the jump.</v>

2090
01:38:42.570 --> 01:38:45.240
<v Speaker 1>It was a TV show in his house and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>

2091
01:38:45.390 --> 01:38:47.850
<v Speaker 1>his whole house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this house was abandoned essentially.</v>

2092
01:38:48.090 --> 01:38:51.030
<v Speaker 1>He just had a kitchen and a bedroom hit </v>
<v Speaker 1>a giant server room.</v>

2093
01:38:51.031 --> 01:38:53.700
<v Speaker 1>He had these wires all throughout the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of his house.</v>

2094
01:38:53.701 --> 01:38:57.270
<v Speaker 1>He's fat fucking cables that were laid </v>
<v Speaker 1>down everywhere.</v>

2095
01:38:57.271 --> 01:38:58.440
<v Speaker 1>You have to step over them.</v>

2096
01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:03.560
<v Speaker 2>So he's got all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love Tom Green because he represents </v>

2097
01:39:04.141 --> 01:39:05.780
<v Speaker 2>what I've have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

2098
01:39:05.820 --> 01:39:08.190
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a self made,</v>

2099
01:39:08.220 --> 01:39:13.220
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like he doesn't wait for people to come </v>

2100
01:39:13.220 --> 01:39:13.950
<v Speaker 2>to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He just does it since he was like 16,</v>

2102
01:39:18.951 --> 01:39:18.951
<v Speaker 2>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he lands on MTV.</v>

2103
01:39:18.951 --> 01:39:20.870
<v Speaker 2>Then he starts doing his own show,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2104

<v Speaker 1>his own thing.</v>

01:42:21.990 --> 01:42:23.590
<v Speaker 3>And on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his desk is taller.</v>

2182
01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:27.010
<v Speaker 3>That's odd approach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's how everybody always did it.</v>

2183
01:42:27.020 --> 01:42:30.760
<v Speaker 3>Was that sideways desk,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Johnny Carson style desk.</v>

2184
01:42:31.010 --> 01:42:31.510
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What did,</v>

2185
01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:33.580
<v Speaker 3>what are you writing books?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What's the desk?</v>

2186
01:42:34.090 --> 01:42:36.490
<v Speaker 3>Why do you have a fucking desk to talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>to people?</v>

2187
01:42:36.490 --> 01:42:41.490
<v Speaker 3>You need a desk that seems retarded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like the guy was a school </v>

2188
01:42:41.490 --> 01:42:43.060
<v Speaker 3>teacher or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's how we looked at it.</v>

2189
01:42:43.270 --> 01:42:48.270
<v Speaker 3>A fucking desk and everyone's so on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Original people are just such copycats </v>

2190
01:42:48.270 --> 01:42:49.960
<v Speaker 3>that everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Craig Ferguson,</v>

2191
01:42:49.961 --> 01:42:50.860
<v Speaker 3>everybody,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jimmy Kimmel,</v>

2192
01:42:50.861 --> 01:42:53.810
<v Speaker 3>everybody just copies the original </v>
<v Speaker 3>Johnny Carson up,</v>

2193
01:42:53.940 --> 01:42:57.490
<v Speaker 3>which is one of the worst formats that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were for communicating with people.</v>

2194
01:42:57.850 --> 01:43:02.850
<v Speaker 3>The only thing it does is establish that</v>
<v Speaker 3>one person is in control of the </v>

2195
01:43:02.850 --> 01:43:02.850
<v Speaker 3>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Guy Behind the desk,</v>

2196
01:43:02.890 --> 01:43:05.470
<v Speaker 3>that's the captain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you'll be right back.</v>

2197
01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:10.560
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he could be right back quicker than if </v>

2198
01:43:10.560 --> 01:43:12.190
<v Speaker 3>just like all bunch of dudes sitting </v>
<v Speaker 3>around a circle with the chairs the same</v>

2199
01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:15.670
<v Speaker 3>height and in the same style.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And just then it'd be a little weird,</v>

2200
01:43:15.690 --> 01:43:17.650
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why is Dean that the head?</v>

2201
01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:20.140
<v Speaker 3>Why doesn't Tom Green get to decide when</v>
<v Speaker 3>they go?</v>

2202
01:43:20.141 --> 01:43:20.560
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

2203
01:43:21.330 --> 01:43:22.780
<v Speaker 3>That's why I think Joan rivers had it </v>
<v Speaker 3>best.</v>

2204
01:43:22.781 --> 01:43:24.850
<v Speaker 3>She had it in bed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the most comfortable.</v>

2205
01:43:24.851 --> 01:43:27.200
<v Speaker 3>Or just gazing each other's eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>May touch some feet.</v>

2206
01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:32.600
<v Speaker 3>Amanda.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't get a chance to do that right </v>

2207
01:43:32.600 --> 01:43:34.600
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to add that I really didn't </v>

2208
01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:34.600
<v Speaker 3>get a chance to meet her either,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I.</v>

2209
01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:34.600
<v Speaker 3>Bummer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was booked on that.</v>

2210
01:43:34.720 --> 01:43:36.230
<v Speaker 3>I was booked on that and something </v>
<v Speaker 3>happened.</v>

2211
01:43:36.260 --> 01:43:38.470
<v Speaker 3>We canceled or some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>someone canceled.</v>

2212
01:43:38.471 --> 01:43:42.310
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember the exact details,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she was an all time great.</v>

2213
01:43:42.460 --> 01:43:43.900
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All the time.</v>

2214
01:43:43.901 --> 01:43:45.490
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ballsy to the end.</v>

2215
01:43:45.810 --> 01:43:50.810
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just that what she had to put up with </v>

2216
01:43:50.810 --> 01:43:52.310
<v Speaker 3>when she decided to run show after </v>
<v Speaker 3>carson and he just bands</v>

2217
01:43:52.310 --> 01:43:54.830
<v Speaker 2>her.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She could have easily just been buried.</v>

2218
01:43:54.970 --> 01:43:56.490
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>son was a douchebag.</v>

2219
01:43:56.690 --> 01:43:58.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you watch the documentary.</v>

2220
01:43:59.010 --> 01:44:04.010
<v Speaker 1>He had a big dude and he was a big Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both things were different than,</v>

2221
01:44:04.361 --> 01:44:06.070
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't be that guy today.</v>

2222
01:44:06.071 --> 01:44:11.071
<v Speaker 1>Nobody would allow it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would get out that you're that kind </v>

2223
01:44:11.071 --> 01:44:13.741
<v Speaker 1>of a con shitty to people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also back then you know we </v>

2224
01:44:13.741 --> 01:44:17.161
<v Speaker 1>talked about this with Howard stern and </v>
<v Speaker 1>radio guys is like back then they were </v>

2225
01:44:17.161 --> 01:44:19.540
<v Speaker 1>all fighting over a time slot and that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of stupid</v>

2226
01:44:19.940 --> 01:44:23.360
<v Speaker 2>time slots are gone now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's people whenever they're working and</v>

2227
01:44:23.361 --> 01:44:26.690
<v Speaker 2>listening or working out or commuting or</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

2228
01:44:26.810 --> 01:44:29.290
<v Speaker 1>Well because of dvrs and also with </v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

2229
01:44:29.360 --> 01:44:30.920
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that letterman kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

2230
01:44:30.950 --> 01:44:35.950
<v Speaker 1>one of the reasons why he decided to </v>
<v Speaker 1>step back was what shows had become </v>

2231
01:44:35.950 --> 01:44:40.070
<v Speaker 1>mostly is like the show would get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>certain amount of views but would really</v>

2232
01:44:40.071 --> 01:44:45.071
<v Speaker 1>would get a lot of use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be the clips from the show that </v>

2233
01:44:45.071 --> 01:44:48.161
<v Speaker 1>would go online and then people will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to access those whenever they </v>

2234
01:44:48.161 --> 01:44:48.980
<v Speaker 1>wanted it and that became a big thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was missing that.</v>

2235
01:44:49.480 --> 01:44:51.200
<v Speaker 1>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not doing that.</v>

2236
01:44:51.201 --> 01:44:54.710
<v Speaker 1>Like Jimmy Fallon is doing that Kimmel's</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing that.</v>

2237
01:44:54.711 --> 01:44:57.350
<v Speaker 1>We're not doing that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he just realized that that the whole</v>

2238
01:44:57.380 --> 01:45:00.410
<v Speaker 1>genre was kind of passing his style by.</v>

2239
01:45:00.710 --> 01:45:01.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

2240
01:45:01.521 --> 01:45:06.521
<v Speaker 2>Marin was on last week and they made the</v>
<v Speaker 2>quip that Marin stops masturbating </v>

2241
01:45:06.521 --> 01:45:11.231
<v Speaker 2>because it drought because he </v>
<v Speaker 2>masturbates in shower and it was a huge </v>

2242
01:45:11.231 --> 01:45:12.320
<v Speaker 2>clip on youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're instantly going to watch it,</v>

2243
01:45:12.321 --> 01:45:13.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because uh,</v>

2244
01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:16.540
<v Speaker 2>they break it down into the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the meat of the interviews,</v>

2245
01:45:16.580 --> 01:45:20.360
<v Speaker 2>the funny jokes where you can watch the </v>
<v Speaker 2>show kind of in like 15 minutes.</v>

2246
01:45:20.810 --> 01:45:23.270
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that Louis ck thing.</v>

2247
01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:26.080
<v Speaker 1>Everything is great and no one's happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2248
01:45:26.210 --> 01:45:31.210
<v Speaker 1>The thing about a technology that was on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conan and that became like this huge </v>

2249
01:45:32.181 --> 01:45:37.181
<v Speaker 1>viral sensation which was way bigger hit</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the actual episode itself,</v>

2250
01:45:37.250 --> 01:45:38.020
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2251
01:45:38.590 --> 01:45:40.630
<v Speaker 1>not that many people watch conan </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

2252
01:45:40.640 --> 01:45:41.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty low,</v>

2253
01:45:41.861 --> 01:45:44.690
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very low in comparison to like what</v>

2254
01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:47.180
<v Speaker 1>the Johnny Carson show used to be at one</v>
<v Speaker 1>point in time.</v>

2255
01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:50.780
<v Speaker 1>There's no show like that where </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody watches the tonight show,</v>

2256
01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:53.290
<v Speaker 2>a million a night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Carson.</v>

2257
01:45:53.310 --> 01:45:56.440
<v Speaker 2>And then I guess when he signed off $60 </v>
<v Speaker 2>million on the 97.</v>

2258
01:45:56.441 --> 01:45:56.560
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2259
01:45:57.420 --> 01:46:00.690
<v Speaker 1>When you get on the tonight show back </v>
<v Speaker 1>then they made a star out of you.</v>

2260
01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:04.440
<v Speaker 1>There's no show like that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That makes someone a star,</v>

2261
01:46:04.620 --> 01:46:09.620
<v Speaker 1>but if you became a regular in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tonight show and he would sit on the </v>

2262
01:46:09.620 --> 01:46:10.230
<v Speaker 1>couch next to Johnny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you were in man.</v>

2263
01:46:10.470 --> 01:46:12.570
<v Speaker 1>You made it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were royalty.</v>

2264
01:46:12.571 --> 01:46:14.020
<v Speaker 1>You were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You were adorned,</v>

2265
01:46:14.050 --> 01:46:15.800
<v Speaker 1>you were knighted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2266
01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:16.680
<v Speaker 1>Steven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2267
01:46:16.860 --> 01:46:20.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean it changed his world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was that Letterman or was that Carson?</v>

2268
01:46:20.310 --> 01:46:21.060
<v Speaker 1>Carson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carson.</v>

2269
01:46:21.061 --> 01:46:25.280
<v Speaker 1>He was asked back the next day because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we come back tomorrow and he came back,</v>

2270
01:46:25.290 --> 01:46:27.090
<v Speaker 1>did another set the next day or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>

2271
01:46:27.091 --> 01:46:27.380
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

2272
01:46:28.650 --> 01:46:31.250
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said this to people all the time.</v>

2273
01:46:31.620 --> 01:46:34.400
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's bigger to do Rogan,</v>

2274
01:46:34.401 --> 01:46:39.320
<v Speaker 2>podcast or Marin or say the top five </v>
<v Speaker 2>than it is to do it tonight.</v>

2275
01:46:39.321 --> 01:46:40.910
<v Speaker 2>Show set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it is.</v>

2276
01:46:40.911 --> 01:46:43.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I go all over and people go,</v>

2277
01:46:43.130 --> 01:46:48.130
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard you on such and such and it's </v>

2278
01:46:48.130 --> 01:46:49.860
<v Speaker 2>amazing because people find those </v>
<v Speaker 2>podcasts at different times.</v>

2279
01:46:49.861 --> 01:46:49.980
<v Speaker 2>If</v>

2280
01:46:49.980 --> 01:46:52.680
<v Speaker 4>you're on TV goes by and if they didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>see it,</v>

2281
01:46:52.681 --> 01:46:56.190
<v Speaker 4>they didn't see it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but everyday somebody finds an episode.</v>

2282
01:46:56.191 --> 01:47:01.191
<v Speaker 4>I was on a say this a year from now that</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just heard John Rogan man and they </v>

2283
01:47:01.861 --> 01:47:06.861
<v Speaker 4>discovered on their own timeframe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well we have it set up the most access </v>

2284
01:47:07.141 --> 01:47:09.270
<v Speaker 4>possible to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have a subscription based.</v>

2285
01:47:09.450 --> 01:47:12.630
<v Speaker 4>Some guys like you can get the first </v>
<v Speaker 4>episodes like Marin has that right?</v>

2286
01:47:12.660 --> 01:47:13.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the backlog,</v>

2287
01:47:13.830 --> 01:47:16.770
<v Speaker 4>first 50 or free or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you buy the backlogs.</v>

2288
01:47:16.950 --> 01:47:20.160
<v Speaker 4>But I feel like like you fuck yourself </v>
<v Speaker 4>when you do that.</v>

2289
01:47:20.161 --> 01:47:23.670
<v Speaker 4>I feel like the real connection is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the fact that it's all free.</v>

2290
01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:25.140
<v Speaker 4>That's a big.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the,</v>

2291
01:47:25.170 --> 01:47:25.440
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

2292
01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:26.790
<v Speaker 4>the easiest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He can get it.</v>

2293
01:47:26.791 --> 01:47:31.791
<v Speaker 4>Whether it's through stitcher or through</v>
<v Speaker 4>youtube or through ustream or Vimeo or </v>

2294
01:47:31.791 --> 01:47:36.471
<v Speaker 4>whatever the fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just gotta be able to get it as </v>

2295
01:47:36.471 --> 01:47:36.471
<v Speaker 4>easily as possible.</v>

2296
01:47:36.471 --> 01:47:40.370
<v Speaker 4>And then if people like it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just spreads the growth we're </v>

2297
01:47:40.370 --> 01:47:42.210
<v Speaker 4>experiencing because of just word of </v>
<v Speaker 4>mouth.</v>

2298
01:47:42.390 --> 01:47:44.880
<v Speaker 4>We're up 2 million downloads from last </v>
<v Speaker 4>month.</v>

2299
01:47:44.881 --> 01:47:47.100
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>10 million in a month.</v>

2300
01:47:47.160 --> 01:47:51.480
<v Speaker 4>I call it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like an exponential fucking tsunami</v>

2301
01:47:51.481 --> 01:47:52.830
<v Speaker 4>of madness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy.</v>

2302
01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:54.200
<v Speaker 4>I call it the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2303
01:47:54.510 --> 01:47:58.140
<v Speaker 4>it's like metallica.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the old school grassroots.</v>

2304
01:47:58.410 --> 01:48:02.160
<v Speaker 4>Metallica had a cassette tape,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like 40 people got them.</v>

2305
01:48:02.570 --> 01:48:05.280
<v Speaker 4>Lars sent them two guys.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love Metallica.</v>

2306
01:48:05.281 --> 01:48:07.230
<v Speaker 4>Send me a tape.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They copied those tapes,</v>

2307
01:48:07.231 --> 01:48:10.110
<v Speaker 4>they send them to their buddies,</v>
<v Speaker 4>their buddies copy those tapes.</v>

2308
01:48:10.111 --> 01:48:12.750
<v Speaker 4>They send them in their bodies in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>matter of five years.</v>

2309
01:48:12.751 --> 01:48:16.860
<v Speaker 4>There's probably $200,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>of those cassettes out grass roots.</v>

2310
01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:21.920
<v Speaker 4>Tell me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not ironic that Lars Ulrich wasn't </v>

2311
01:48:21.920 --> 01:48:22.200
<v Speaker 4>gonna to take down napster after all </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2312
01:48:22.380 --> 01:48:27.380
<v Speaker 4>So Larry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like word of mouth and the ability </v>

2313
01:48:27.380 --> 01:48:28.440
<v Speaker 4>to spread your shit was what made them </v>
<v Speaker 4>in the first place and then he's like,</v>

2314
01:48:28.441 --> 01:48:29.850
<v Speaker 4>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we want that money.</v>

2315
01:48:31.110 --> 01:48:33.540
<v Speaker 4>That money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Napster should have used Trey Parker and</v>

2316
01:48:33.541 --> 01:48:34.920
<v Speaker 4>Matt Stone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Instead.</v>

2317
01:48:34.950 --> 01:48:39.950
<v Speaker 4>They gave a vhs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They made a vhs tape as a little </v>

2318
01:48:39.950 --> 01:48:43.310
<v Speaker 4>Christmas gift.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like a 10 minute thing and then </v>

2319
01:48:43.310 --> 01:48:43.310
<v Speaker 4>that spread through Hollywood over </v>
<v Speaker 4>night.</v>

2320
01:48:43.310 --> 01:48:47.920
<v Speaker 4>I saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw it back then before the show was </v>

2321
01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:47.920
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

2322
01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:47.920
<v Speaker 4>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the Brian Boitano one.</v>

2323
01:48:48.030 --> 01:48:49.860
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was God damn genius.</v>

2324
01:48:49.861 --> 01:48:51.330
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Brian Boitano do.</v>

2325
01:48:51.690 --> 01:48:55.890
<v Speaker 4>Alls I'm saying is metal people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way they spread stuff are like what?</v>

2326
01:48:55.900 --> 01:48:58.680
<v Speaker 4>Pod comedy podcasts people are.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's great.</v>

2327
01:48:58.681 --> 01:48:59.250
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

2328
01:48:59.251 --> 01:49:04.251
<v Speaker 4>did you hear this show?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think one of the best things about </v>

2329
01:49:04.251 --> 01:49:06.600
<v Speaker 4>comedy podcast is unlike what happened </v>
<v Speaker 4>with Johnny Carson and Joan rivers,</v>

2330
01:49:06.860 --> 01:49:10.500
<v Speaker 4>podcasts was all support other podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it seems to be across the board.</v>

2331
01:49:10.501 --> 01:49:13.050
<v Speaker 4>I haven't seen any beef where podcasts </v>
<v Speaker 4>are saying,</v>

2332
01:49:13.051 --> 01:49:14.760
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you do Adam Carolla show,</v>

2333
01:49:14.761 --> 01:49:15.830
<v Speaker 4>you can't do my show.</v>

2334
01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:16.980
<v Speaker 4>No one does that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2335
01:49:17.190 --> 01:49:18.960
<v Speaker 4>that was the model.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was the model.</v>

2336
01:49:18.961 --> 01:49:20.760
<v Speaker 4>They all did it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They all did totally.</v>

2337
01:49:21.060 --> 01:49:24.450
<v Speaker 4>They all fucked each other because of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that and because they were fighting over</v>

2338
01:49:24.451 --> 01:49:29.451
<v Speaker 4>these time slots and everyone had this </v>
<v Speaker 4>famine theory going on where if you </v>

2339
01:49:29.551 --> 01:49:34.551
<v Speaker 4>weren't number one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you were below number one and if you </v>

2340
01:49:34.551 --> 01:49:34.551
<v Speaker 4>were losing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're in second place,</v>

2341
01:49:34.551 --> 01:49:37.530
<v Speaker 4>he made less money and everyone's </v>
<v Speaker 4>panicking so they had these politics are</v>

2342
01:49:37.531 --> 01:49:42.531
<v Speaker 4>playing back and forth like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember that movie that they is </v>

2343
01:49:42.531 --> 01:49:42.531
<v Speaker 4>correct.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jay Leno,</v>

2344
01:49:42.531 --> 01:49:44.680
<v Speaker 4>David Letterman and the late night wars </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that.</v>

2345
01:49:44.910 --> 01:49:48.010
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't NBC do that right now with like </v>
<v Speaker 4>fallon or somebody like</v>

2346
01:49:48.010 --> 01:49:53.010
<v Speaker 3>that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you do found you can't do camel or </v>

2347
01:49:53.010 --> 01:49:53.010
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can do family.</v>

2348
01:49:53.010 --> 01:49:54.550
<v Speaker 3>They probably have laws like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2349
01:49:54.551 --> 01:49:55.240
<v Speaker 3>they probably.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2350
01:49:55.241 --> 01:49:57.550
<v Speaker 3>some people could probably do whatever </v>
<v Speaker 3>the fuck they want,</v>

2351
01:49:57.551 --> 01:50:01.480
<v Speaker 3>but they probably have laws like that or</v>
<v Speaker 3>unwritten rules didn't.</v>

2352
01:50:01.510 --> 01:50:03.040
<v Speaker 3>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do them all and they go,</v>

2353
01:50:03.041 --> 01:50:04.510
<v Speaker 3>that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We just want to narrow.</v>

2354
01:50:04.570 --> 01:50:09.460
<v Speaker 3>It's a stupid model.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to be tuned in by 11:00.</v>

2355
01:50:09.461 --> 01:50:11.500
<v Speaker 3>That's when it starts and it ends at </v>
<v Speaker 3>1:30.</v>

2356
01:50:12.160 --> 01:50:15.310
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just show it all the time.</v>

2357
01:50:16.500 --> 01:50:19.180
<v Speaker 3>Have it available whenever anybody wants</v>
<v Speaker 3>to watch it,</v>

2358
01:50:19.181 --> 01:50:24.181
<v Speaker 3>then it will be better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like this model of like tuning in </v>

2359
01:50:24.181 --> 01:50:25.690
<v Speaker 3>for something and waiting for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like that's why I love Netflix.</v>

2360
01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:28.690
<v Speaker 3>Netflix takes a season and they go a </v>
<v Speaker 3>season.</v>

2361
01:50:28.691 --> 01:50:31.660
<v Speaker 3>Three of the orange is the new black is </v>
<v Speaker 3>out.</v>

2362
01:50:31.690 --> 01:50:34.150
<v Speaker 3>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you get all the fucking episodes.</v>

2363
01:50:34.300 --> 01:50:38.260
<v Speaker 3>The whole season is out in one fell </v>
<v Speaker 3>swoop that benchwatch,</v>

2364
01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:42.160
<v Speaker 3>which I love to do in a hotel somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the road to best tap.</v>

2365
01:50:42.340 --> 01:50:47.340
<v Speaker 3>If you get ahold of a fucking series and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you find out about it and you find out </v>

2366
01:50:47.340 --> 01:50:48.370
<v Speaker 3>about it like after five seasons already</v>
<v Speaker 3>done.</v>

2367
01:50:48.400 --> 01:50:53.400
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't find out about game of thrones </v>

2368
01:50:53.400 --> 01:50:55.171
<v Speaker 3>until I think the second season.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I watched the whole first season and </v>

2369
01:50:55.171 --> 01:50:58.640
<v Speaker 3>then deep and when I caught up I was sad</v>
<v Speaker 3>that we week.</v>

2370
01:51:00.100 --> 01:51:03.040
<v Speaker 3>That was me with breaking bad three </v>
<v Speaker 3>seasons straight.</v>

2371
01:51:03.460 --> 01:51:08.050
<v Speaker 3>I got the flu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the flu.</v>

2372
01:51:08.140 --> 01:51:10.220
<v Speaker 3>It's still dark.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're feeling shitty.</v>

2373
01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:15.940
<v Speaker 3>I watched all three and then I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

2374
01:51:15.941 --> 01:51:18.160
<v Speaker 3>now I've got a wait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck.</v>

2375
01:51:18.161 --> 01:51:23.161
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that that's the future is going </v>

2376
01:51:23.161 --> 01:51:25.870
<v Speaker 3>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to laugh one day thinking </v>

2377
01:51:25.870 --> 01:51:25.870
<v Speaker 3>about the idea of tuning into a special </v>
<v Speaker 3>time to watch a show like,</v>

2378
01:51:25.870 --> 01:51:29.690
<v Speaker 3>well not like a world premiere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>APM shouldn't ever eat your popcorn once</v>

2379
01:51:30.070 --> 01:51:34.900
<v Speaker 3>you've had it for hours uploaded,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uploaded.</v>

2380
01:51:34.930 --> 01:51:37.780
<v Speaker 3>So I can get it whenever on demand is </v>
<v Speaker 3>the future 100 percent.</v>

2381
01:51:37.870 --> 01:51:39.850
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything else is stupid.</v>

2382
01:51:39.880 --> 01:51:44.880
<v Speaker 3>It really is the idea of like tuning in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I guess maybe new shows with that </v>

2383
01:51:45.311 --> 01:51:48.040
<v Speaker 3>exception because the end of the day you</v>
<v Speaker 3>do want to kind of find him.</v>

2384

<v Speaker 3>though shows man,</v>

2385
01:51:51.430 --> 01:51:56.430

<v Speaker 3>young Turks and all these online shows </v>

2386
01:51:56.430 --> 01:51:56.950
<v Speaker 3>that can do whatever they want.</v>

2387

<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2396
01:52:17.070 --> 01:52:18.810
<v Speaker 3>for people on periscope right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got four different camera views.</v>

2397
01:52:18.850 --> 01:52:21.690
<v Speaker 3>Totally right now and that's what it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be like.</v>

2398
01:52:21.850 --> 01:52:24.370
<v Speaker 3>USTREAM did a lot of that during the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ferguson riots.</v>

2399
01:52:24.870 --> 01:52:28.810
<v Speaker 3>Streaming services that do that during </v>

<v Speaker 3>an hour.</v>

2404
01:52:37.391 --> 01:52:42.391
<v Speaker 3>I had no idea who they were.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were just as miscellaneous person </v>

2405
01:52:42.391 --> 01:52:43.110
<v Speaker 3>in Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just watching them hanging out,</v>

2406
01:52:44.550 --> 01:52:46.220

2420
01:53:14.350 --> 01:53:15.740
<v Speaker 4>comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have 1000 true fans,</v>

2421
01:53:16.100 --> 01:53:18.560
<v Speaker 4>you can survive as an artist.</v>

<v Speaker 4>what are you showing me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just showing that the other day on</v>

<v Speaker 4>people watching live on periscope live </v>

2425
01:53:28.220 --> 01:53:28.760

<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's all the same time,</v>

2426
01:53:28.761 --> 01:53:33.761
<v Speaker 4>but it was 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>different people watch and it was just </v>

2427
01:53:33.761 --> 01:53:33.761
<v Speaker 4>fucking with people.</v>

2428

<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>

<v Speaker 4>what are you saying?</v>

2430
01:53:36.321 --> 01:53:38.310
<v Speaker 4>If you have a thousand true fans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what?</v>

2431
01:53:38.380 --> 01:53:38.840
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2432
01:53:38.841 --> 01:53:40.730
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's an article a guy wrote,</v>

2433
01:53:41.540 --> 01:53:46.540
<v Speaker 4>I read it online about two weeks ago and</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said that if you as an artist have </v>

2434
01:53:46.540 --> 01:53:51.320
<v Speaker 4>1000 true fans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you could survive a doing art,</v>

2435
01:53:51.410 --> 01:53:56.410
<v Speaker 4>whatever form of art you do forever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because he said the 1000 people,</v>

2436
01:53:56.571 --> 01:53:57.210
<v Speaker 4>which you think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2437
01:53:57.260 --> 01:54:00.380
<v Speaker 4>that sounds pretty easy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to get 100 right now.</v>

2438
01:54:01.740 --> 01:54:04.610
<v Speaker 4>This is an incredible article.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you read this,</v>

2439
01:54:05.220 --> 01:54:06.180
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2440
01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:11.240
<v Speaker 4>we'll get to the end of the long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The long tails of famously good.</v>

2441
01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:13.600
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2442
01:54:13.610 --> 01:54:14.930
<v Speaker 4>Just stop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm reading.</v>

2443
01:54:15.140 --> 01:54:16.430
<v Speaker 4>Fuck scrolling.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>

2444
01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:20.750
<v Speaker 4>The long tail is famously good news for </v>
<v Speaker 4>two classes of people.</v>

2445
01:54:20.751 --> 01:54:25.751
<v Speaker 4>A few lucky aggregators such as Amazon </v>
<v Speaker 4>and Netflix and 6 billion consumers of </v>

2446
01:54:25.751 --> 01:54:26.990
<v Speaker 4>those two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's okay.</v>

2447
01:54:26.991 --> 01:54:28.970
<v Speaker 4>This is what they said though.</v>

2448
01:54:28.970 --> 01:54:33.970
<v Speaker 4>Basically as if you have 1000 fans that </v>
<v Speaker 4>each spend about $100 a year on your </v>

2449
01:54:34.380 --> 01:54:35.810
<v Speaker 4>meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They bought a DVD,</v>

2450
01:54:36.500 --> 01:54:38.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or they bought a ticket,</v>

2451
01:54:38.751 --> 01:54:43.751
<v Speaker 4>a couple of tickets or they watched your</v>
<v Speaker 4>special 100 a year.</v>

2452
01:54:43.821 --> 01:54:46.400
<v Speaker 4>You got about 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>after everything,</v>

2453
01:54:46.460 --> 01:54:47.960
<v Speaker 4>maybe 50,</v>
<v Speaker 4>60.</v>

2454
01:54:48.050 --> 01:54:49.910
<v Speaker 4>You could survive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Awesome.</v>

2455
01:54:50.270 --> 01:54:51.380
<v Speaker 4>On that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every year.</v>

2456
01:54:51.710 --> 01:54:54.260
<v Speaker 4>The problem I have is the term true fan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2457
01:54:54.261 --> 01:54:57.580
<v Speaker 4>I fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't even like saying fans either.</v>

2458
01:54:57.620 --> 01:54:59.360
<v Speaker 4>People who,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you say friends,</v>

<v Speaker 4>supporting it.</v>

2465
01:55:16.330 --> 01:55:20.310

<v Speaker 4>it's kind of cool because it's like you </v>

2533
01:58:05.820 --> 01:58:08.480
<v Speaker 1>What's a weird time to be alive with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole shit?</v>

2534
01:58:08.810 --> 01:58:13.810
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was lucky too that I figured out how </v>

2535
01:58:13.810 --> 01:58:13.810
<v Speaker 2>to do it on my own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2536
01:58:13.810 --> 01:58:18.221
<v Speaker 2>like I was looking at Brian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went on the road with Brian last year </v>

2537
01:58:18.221 --> 01:58:21.440
<v Speaker 2>and this fucking guy works his ass off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're out on the road.</v>

2538
01:58:21.441 --> 01:58:26.441
<v Speaker 2>How dare you lie to America knows him </v>
<v Speaker 2>way more than you did when we were out </v>

2539
01:58:26.661 --> 01:58:28.460
<v Speaker 2>on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was working his ass off.</v>

2540
01:58:28.461 --> 01:58:30.800
<v Speaker 2>He had the shows booked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had the hotel's booked,</v>

2541
01:58:30.801 --> 01:58:35.801
<v Speaker 2>he had the car rental car,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had the flights and we're cruising </v>

2542
01:58:35.801 --> 01:58:36.220
<v Speaker 2>around and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is a self made,</v>

2543
01:58:36.440 --> 01:58:37.550
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>machine here,</v>

2544
01:58:37.551 --> 01:58:38.360
<v Speaker 2>the desk squad.</v>

2545
01:58:38.770 --> 01:58:41.980
<v Speaker 1>You have to figure out a way to do your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own in this day and age</v>

2546
01:58:41.980 --> 01:58:44.080
<v Speaker 3>because if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you do bring other people in,</v>

2547
01:58:44.081 --> 01:58:49.081
<v Speaker 3>especially in the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to have to give them a cut </v>

2548
01:58:49.081 --> 01:58:52.980
<v Speaker 3>of almost nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like as you're hustling and you're </v>

2549
01:58:52.980 --> 01:58:56.161
<v Speaker 3>trying to put together these shows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're given a manager 15 percent of </v>

2550
01:58:56.161 --> 01:58:56.500
<v Speaker 3>that or an agent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 percent,</v>

2551
01:58:56.680 --> 01:58:59.140
<v Speaker 3>25 percent is gone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then you have to pay taxes.</v>

2552
01:58:59.360 --> 01:58:59.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2553
01:59:00.030 --> 01:59:01.540
<v Speaker 11>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 11>it sucks is when you're on the road with</v>

2554
01:59:01.541 --> 01:59:06.541
<v Speaker 11>somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 11>it does have a manager and then they </v>

2555
01:59:06.541 --> 01:59:06.541
<v Speaker 11>still get your 10 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Like,</v>

2556
01:59:06.541 --> 01:59:08.300
<v Speaker 11>I don't want to say who,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but like I like got checks because I was</v>

2557
01:59:08.301 --> 01:59:11.980
<v Speaker 11>on the road and their manager took my.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Took 10 percent of the mic and I'm like,</v>

2558
01:59:11.981 --> 01:59:14.130
<v Speaker 11>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 11>wait,</v>

2559
01:59:14.300 --> 01:59:15.100
<v Speaker 11>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 11>wait a minute,</v>

2560
01:59:15.250 --> 01:59:17.330
<v Speaker 11>wait a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 11>When we talk a lot,</v>

2561
01:59:18.280 --> 01:59:20.950
<v Speaker 11>you got robbed.</v>
<v Speaker 11>You don't have a contract with someone.</v>

2562
01:59:20.951 --> 01:59:24.040
<v Speaker 11>And they took 10 percent of your check.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Who the fuck is this?</v>

2563

2565
01:59:30.281 --> 01:59:35.281
<v Speaker 11>So it's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but I can tell you that it's going to </v>

2566
01:59:35.281 --> 01:59:37.000
<v Speaker 11>get a certain amount and then they took </v>
<v Speaker 11>them out.</v>

2567
01:59:37.980 --> 01:59:41.650
<v Speaker 11>Brian opened up the can.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Someone's robbing?</v>

2568
01:59:41.660 --> 01:59:42.400

2569
01:59:42.880 --> 01:59:47.880
<v Speaker 11>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 11>but with working with like Dean </v>

<v Speaker 11>the Dean doesn't have it.</v>

2571
01:59:47.880 --> 01:59:48.430
<v Speaker 11>Let's have a fake name.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Let's use a fake name.</v>

<v Speaker 11>That's someone's stealing money.</v>

2574
01:59:57.850 --> 01:59:59.090
<v Speaker 11>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>

2575
01:59:59.710 --> 02:00:02.280
<v Speaker 11>it's just weird that managers even do </v>
<v Speaker 11>that.</v>

2576
02:00:02.281 --> 02:00:05.000
<v Speaker 11>So damaging you.</v>
<v Speaker 11>If he's not managing judging</v>

2577
02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:08.210
<v Speaker 3>you like a manager,</v>
<v Speaker 3>here's a person that Gig.</v>

2578
02:00:08.460 --> 02:00:11.120
<v Speaker 3>Where's your cut as well?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2579
02:00:11.190 --> 02:00:12.250
<v Speaker 3>here's the deal though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is this?</v>

2580
02:00:12.270 --> 02:00:14.010
<v Speaker 3>What I'm saying is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as a manager,</v>

2581
02:00:14.011 --> 02:00:17.640
<v Speaker 3>a manager is a longterm commitment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had the same manager since I was an</v>

2582
02:00:17.641 --> 02:00:21.750
<v Speaker 3>open mic or most comedians try to keep </v>
<v Speaker 3>it manager for a long time and the agent</v>

2583
02:00:21.751 --> 02:00:26.700
<v Speaker 3>is someone who works with you guys but </v>
<v Speaker 3>is not as close as the manager.</v>

2584
02:00:26.701 --> 02:00:31.701
<v Speaker 3>The manager's supposed to be the person </v>
<v Speaker 3>that's like looking over your career in </v>

2585
02:00:31.701 --> 02:00:35.361
<v Speaker 3>an advisory position and like no one's </v>
<v Speaker 3>advising you because not advising you go</v>

2586
02:00:35.741 --> 02:00:40.741
<v Speaker 3>on periscope now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really think it'll help because he's </v>

2587
02:00:40.741 --> 02:00:40.741
<v Speaker 3>not advising you at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's taking 10 percent.</v>

2588
02:00:40.741 --> 02:00:42.710
<v Speaker 3>For what reason?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Say stuck in a Gig.</v>

2589
02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:44.940
<v Speaker 3>I guess you got to get that money back.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

2590
02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:49.020
<v Speaker 3>Take time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to find that money back.</v>

2591
02:00:49.050 --> 02:00:50.550
<v Speaker 3>One way or another.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We had a book,</v>

2592
02:00:50.551 --> 02:00:52.370
<v Speaker 3>a Gig with this guy and then we'll go </v>
<v Speaker 3>steal.</v>

2593
02:00:52.430 --> 02:00:54.770
<v Speaker 3>Steal that money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Damn it.</v>

<v Speaker 12>So good man.</v>

2635
02:03:01.051 --> 02:03:04.800
<v Speaker 12>I went out there 16 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 12>That thing ate and ate.</v>

2636
02:03:04.920 --> 02:03:07.210
<v Speaker 12>That took 16 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And this,</v>

2637
02:03:08.010 --> 02:03:11.660
<v Speaker 12>this rib cage is the worst place ever to</v>
<v Speaker 12>get a tattoo.</v>

2638
02:03:11.670 --> 02:03:12.780
<v Speaker 12>I'm already started.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I went,</v>

2639
02:03:13.020 --> 02:03:18.020
<v Speaker 12>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you might want to move to another spot </v>

2640
02:03:18.020 --> 02:03:18.020
<v Speaker 12>for a few minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 12>That's kind of tender.</v>

2641
02:03:18.020 --> 02:03:18.020
<v Speaker 12>And he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 12>yeah,</v>

2642
02:03:18.020 --> 02:03:20.460
<v Speaker 12>the whole thing's going to be like that </v>
<v Speaker 12>as like what?</v>

2643
02:03:20.461 --> 02:03:23.610
<v Speaker 12>We're only 10 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 12>You're ready to quit?</v>

2644
02:03:23.700 --> 02:03:25.840
<v Speaker 12>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I will make it a bumblebee.</v>

2645
02:03:25.980 --> 02:03:28.560
<v Speaker 12>And how much harder is it than your </v>
<v Speaker 12>arms?</v>

2646
02:03:28.830 --> 02:03:29.970
<v Speaker 12>It's so.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's,</v>

2647
02:03:30.180 --> 02:03:32.180
<v Speaker 12>it's like I can't describe it.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's,</v>

2648
02:03:32.190 --> 02:03:37.190
<v Speaker 12>it's so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's so bad that I didn't get angus on </v>

2649
02:03:37.190 --> 02:03:38.790
<v Speaker 12>the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 12>which was the original plan.</v>

2650
02:03:40.850 --> 02:03:43.920
<v Speaker 12>I,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I'll probably do it though if you do it,</v>

2651
02:03:43.950 --> 02:03:46.250
<v Speaker 12>we should film it on periscope,</v>
<v Speaker 12>right?</v>

2652
02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:52.000
<v Speaker 12>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 12>we should have him do it here in the </v>

2653
02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:52.950
<v Speaker 12>studio with Joey Diaz is getting </v>
<v Speaker 12>sponsors on periscope now.</v>

2654
02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:55.410
<v Speaker 12>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 12>they're contacting him because he does.</v>

2655
02:03:55.520 --> 02:03:58.140
<v Speaker 12>He does the morning joint,</v>
<v Speaker 12>gets up in the morning.</v>

2656
02:03:58.350 --> 02:04:01.530
<v Speaker 12>He lights up a joint and he starts </v>
<v Speaker 12>dropping science of motivation.</v>

2657
02:04:01.960 --> 02:04:03.600
<v Speaker 12>Dog.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Good.</v>

2658
02:04:03.830 --> 02:04:04.830
<v Speaker 12>So for,</v>
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>

2659
02:04:04.831 --> 02:04:09.831
<v Speaker 12>whatever minutes he,</v>
<v Speaker 12>when he gets up and smokes his first </v>

2660
02:04:09.831 --> 02:04:09.920
<v Speaker 12>joint of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 12>he brings people on this ride with them.</v>

2661
02:04:09.921 --> 02:04:11.640
<v Speaker 12>They call it the morning joint.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So he's going to get.</v>

2662
02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:15.300
<v Speaker 12>You could get a sponsor.</v>
<v Speaker 12>You had your tattoo.</v>

2663
02:04:15.540 --> 02:04:16.710
<v Speaker 12>That'd be great.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Right?</v>

2664
02:04:17.260 --> 02:04:19.740
<v Speaker 12>It might have been paid for the Tattoo </v>
<v Speaker 12>man about that.</v>

2665
02:04:19.800 --> 02:04:24.800
<v Speaker 12>I really want to get the other side done</v>
<v Speaker 12>and I want to get the comedy star Logo.</v>

2666
02:04:26.760 --> 02:04:30.000
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's just I needed a new logo a little.</v>

2667
02:04:30.410 --> 02:04:30.860
<v Speaker 12>No,</v>
<v Speaker 12>no,</v>

2668
02:04:30.861 --> 02:04:31.170
<v Speaker 12>no,</v>
<v Speaker 12>no.</v>

2669
02:04:31.190 --> 02:04:33.330
<v Speaker 12>I love.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It was just a big deal to me though.</v>

2670
02:04:33.390 --> 02:04:38.390
<v Speaker 12>You know what I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 12>My name's on the wall and it was just </v>

2671
02:04:38.390 --> 02:04:41.150
<v Speaker 12>like it was,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it was the biggest thing that ever </v>

2672
02:04:41.150 --> 02:04:43.050
<v Speaker 12>happened to me and I played music and </v>
<v Speaker 12>toured with everybody and done all kinds</v>

2673
02:04:43.051 --> 02:04:45.390
<v Speaker 12>of shit,</v>
<v Speaker 12>but that was next level stuff.</v>

2674
02:04:45.391 --> 02:04:47.120
<v Speaker 12>It's great until you look at some other </v>
<v Speaker 12>people to run them</v>

2675
02:04:47.200 --> 02:04:52.200
<v Speaker 11>wall on fucking second split Gaddy boys.</v>
<v Speaker 11>What fucks on that?</v>

2676
02:04:53.740 --> 02:04:58.740
<v Speaker 11>We'll take some black paint.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I sat there the other day and just </v>

2677
02:05:00.530 --> 02:05:03.800
<v Speaker 11>googled like half the names on the front</v>
<v Speaker 11>patio because I was like,</v>

2678
02:05:03.830 --> 02:05:05.340
<v Speaker 11>what?</v>
<v Speaker 11>What's a z cat like,</v>

2679
02:05:05.590 --> 02:05:10.590
<v Speaker 11>what is Zika?</v>
<v Speaker 11>And half of them I don't even think are </v>

2680
02:05:10.590 --> 02:05:13.181
<v Speaker 11>real.</v>
<v Speaker 11>I think literally people like came in </v>

2681
02:05:13.181 --> 02:05:15.131
<v Speaker 11>there and just know there's a few,</v>
<v Speaker 11>like a towing truck company isn't on </v>

2682
02:05:15.131 --> 02:05:15.131
<v Speaker 11>there.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Like how was it?</v>

2683
02:05:15.131 --> 02:05:16.490
<v Speaker 11>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

2684
02:05:16.550 --> 02:05:17.900
<v Speaker 11>I'll show it to you.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's weird.</v>

2685
02:05:18.520 --> 02:05:20.500
<v Speaker 12>It's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's it,</v>

2686
02:05:20.920 --> 02:05:22.270
<v Speaker 12>it's a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 12>To me though.</v>

2687
02:05:22.360 --> 02:05:25.480
<v Speaker 12>It's just like from the ground up,</v>
<v Speaker 12>I was 44.</v>

2688
02:05:25.481 --> 02:05:27.850
<v Speaker 12>I just stumbled onto that patio like,</v>
<v Speaker 12>Hey,</v>

2689
02:05:28.150 --> 02:05:31.420
<v Speaker 12>I'm here to do comedy and they're like </v>
<v Speaker 12>get the fuck outta here.</v>

2690
02:05:32.370 --> 02:05:37.370
<v Speaker 12>Don't had fitzsimmons on yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And we were talking about that book </v>

2691
02:05:37.370 --> 02:05:37.590
<v Speaker 12>about the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 12>What is it called?</v>

2692
02:05:38.550 --> 02:05:43.550
<v Speaker 12>What is it?</v>
<v Speaker 12>Grow to a comment you don't know </v>

2693
02:05:44.950 --> 02:05:49.120
<v Speaker 12>standing there or what is it a.</v>
<v Speaker 12>what's it called?</v>

2694
02:05:49.300 --> 02:05:50.470
<v Speaker 12>It's great book,</v>
<v Speaker 12>man.</v>

2695
02:05:50.471 --> 02:05:52.030
<v Speaker 12>I can't believe no one's made that </v>
<v Speaker 12>movie,</v>

2696
02:05:52.090 --> 02:05:55.690
<v Speaker 12>but what he was basically saying was </v>
<v Speaker 12>that at those days,</v>

2697
02:05:55.720 --> 02:06:00.720
<v Speaker 12>what I'm dying up here,</v>
<v Speaker 12>he was saying that at the description of</v>

2698
02:06:01.361 --> 02:06:04.870
<v Speaker 12>what the store was in the seventies is </v>
<v Speaker 12>exactly like it was today.</v>

2699
02:06:04.930 --> 02:06:09.930
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Like it was like common hanging out in </v>

2700
02:06:09.930 --> 02:06:09.930
<v Speaker 12>the back patio.</v>
<v Speaker 12>People going on stage there.</v>

2701
02:06:09.930 --> 02:06:10.570
<v Speaker 12>It's amazing.</v>

2702
02:06:10.570 --> 02:06:15.010
<v Speaker 12>That place is kept that freaky vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I did a dollar show last night,</v>

2703
02:06:15.040 --> 02:06:20.040
<v Speaker 12>the doormen show and the in the belly </v>
<v Speaker 12>room on such a good idea for a show to </v>

2704
02:06:20.040 --> 02:06:24.571
<v Speaker 12>you don't understand how happy it makes </v>
<v Speaker 12>all the like the door guys and stuff </v>

2705
02:06:24.571 --> 02:06:26.680
<v Speaker 12>that worked there because they pretty </v>
<v Speaker 12>much used to have two nights of open mic</v>

2706
02:06:26.800 --> 02:06:30.010
<v Speaker 12>and then they took it away.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's way better for,</v>

2707
02:06:30.030 --> 02:06:35.030
<v Speaker 12>for the people that work there because </v>
<v Speaker 12>that was the only reason why these guys </v>

2708
02:06:35.030 --> 02:06:36.970
<v Speaker 12>work their work their spot.</v>
<v Speaker 12>So the doormen went up,</v>

2709
02:06:37.210 --> 02:06:39.280
<v Speaker 12>Jeff Ross did some time and I closed it </v>
<v Speaker 12>out.</v>

2710
02:06:39.281 --> 02:06:41.410
<v Speaker 12>I did a half an hour and close it out.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's all sold out.</v>

2711
02:06:41.411 --> 02:06:44.650
<v Speaker 12>It's only a buck is so cool right there </v>
<v Speaker 12>in that room.</v>

2712
02:06:44.651 --> 02:06:47.560
<v Speaker 12>Own it.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Says it says capacity 57.</v>

2713
02:06:47.561 --> 02:06:47.790
<v Speaker 12>Yeah.</v>

2714
02:06:48.340 --> 02:06:49.200
<v Speaker 11>Fire Marshal.</v>

2715
02:06:51.290 --> 02:06:52.880
<v Speaker 12>I think they might vary a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 12>over.</v>

2716
02:06:53.910 --> 02:06:55.370
<v Speaker 12>I don't know what they actually get in </v>
<v Speaker 12>there,</v>

2717
02:06:55.371 --> 02:06:58.820
<v Speaker 12>but it's probably about 94 during a show</v>
<v Speaker 12>there next week.</v>

2718

<v Speaker 2>He gets,</v>

2763
02:08:46.150 --> 02:08:51.150
<v Speaker 2>after he was out of the eagles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had a real low spot where he was </v>

2764
02:08:51.960 --> 02:08:54.400
<v Speaker 2>partying hard and canceling gigs all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

2765
02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:58.480
<v Speaker 2>So he cleaned up and the manager said,</v>

<v Speaker 2>all the shows will be gone.</v>

2767
02:09:02.140 --> 02:09:07.140
<v Speaker 2>So the first night of the tour,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's backstage eating on the deli tray </v>

2768
02:09:07.140 --> 02:09:11.281
<v Speaker 2>after sound check and about a couple of </v>

<v Speaker 12>So many hits gets those.</v>
<v Speaker 12>That era,</v>

2859
02:13:27.131 --> 02:13:29.150
<v Speaker 12>man,</v>
<v Speaker 12>there was so much good music out of that</v>

2860
02:13:29.180 --> 02:13:32.010
<v Speaker 12>era.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's weird how music comes big waves</v>

2861
02:13:32.010 --> 02:13:35.010
<v Speaker 1>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess comedy does too right now.</v>

2862
02:13:35.011 --> 02:13:40.011
<v Speaker 1>It's a huge wave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is probably the biggest waves I've </v>

2866
02:13:45.201 --> 02:13:45.201

<v Speaker 1>the golden era of comedy and everybody </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreed like at all.</v>

2868
02:13:46.890 --> 02:13:49.520
<v Speaker 1>Like Sarah Silverman was onstage kill </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was hanging out with burr.</v>

2869

<v Speaker 1>but we were talking about it.</v>

2873
02:14:00.541 --> 02:14:01.230
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this.</v>

2874

<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's ever been a better</v>

2877
02:14:07.651 --> 02:14:12.240
<v Speaker 1>time with like more like big name </v>
<v Speaker 1>headliners and more young guys coming up</v>

2878
02:14:12.241 --> 02:14:12.990
<v Speaker 1>like the store.</v>

2879
02:14:13.530 --> 02:14:16.500
<v Speaker 1>I've been around the store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took a seven year break,</v>

<v Speaker 1>dedicated new guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like now it's like there's always a few </v>

2882
02:14:25.580 --> 02:14:29.571
<v Speaker 1>guys that were okay and I would like </v>
<v Speaker 1>find those guys and try to help them </v>

2883
02:14:29.571 --> 02:14:29.571
<v Speaker 1>would grab them,</v>

<v Speaker 2>of art.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're all here and we're creating this.</v>

02:14:59.970 --> 02:15:02.160
<v Speaker 1>Well that say that they're always the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Because guys like Joey Diaz just exist.</v>

2903
02:15:12.660 --> 02:15:14.970
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't ever script that.</v>

2904
02:15:15.000 --> 02:15:17.340
<v Speaker 1>You can't hope for that to walk through </v>
<v Speaker 1>your door.</v>

2905
02:15:17.520 --> 02:15:21.210
<v Speaker 1>You can't turn a guy into that does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is what it is.</v>

2906
02:15:21.211 --> 02:15:24.240
<v Speaker 1>And he's the funniest guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If this is the funniest time for comedy,</v>

2907
02:15:24.300 --> 02:15:29.300
<v Speaker 1>I think it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think d is the funniest guy that's </v>

2908
02:15:29.300 --> 02:15:29.300
<v Speaker 1>ever lived.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's ever been any </v>
<v Speaker 1>funnier.</v>

2910
02:15:30.241 --> 02:15:32.370
<v Speaker 1>I seen kinison live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've seen Hicks live.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was already really late in his life,</v>

2912
02:15:36.600 --> 02:15:40.230
<v Speaker 1>but no one is ever crushed in front of </v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

2913
02:15:40.280 --> 02:15:42.390
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Joey Diaz has.</v>

2914
02:15:42.480 --> 02:15:47.480
<v Speaker 1>The other night he did the comedy story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did the or and I had a post about it on </v>

2915
02:15:47.480 --> 02:15:47.480

<v Speaker 1>It was screening.</v>

2918
02:15:53.070 --> 02:15:54.480
<v Speaker 1>People were screaming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>laughing,</v>

02:15:54.481 --> 02:15:55.110
<v Speaker 1>screaming.</v>

2920
02:15:55.480 --> 02:16:00.480

<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2978
02:18:29.700 --> 02:18:29.700
<v Speaker 3>should have made it from the eighties </v>
<v Speaker 3>but didn't.</v>

2979
02:18:29.700 --> 02:18:31.630
<v Speaker 3>And they fell apart.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were still doing the same material,</v>

2980
02:18:31.930 --> 02:18:34.400
<v Speaker 3>but it was the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know how you get a few of those guys</v>

2981
02:18:34.401 --> 02:18:36.550
<v Speaker 3>that occasionally you'll see one of </v>
<v Speaker 3>those guys today.</v>

2982
02:18:37.070 --> 02:18:42.070
<v Speaker 3>It still has the same act for like </v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll be at the ha ha or giggles or </v>

2983
02:18:42.070 --> 02:18:42.070
<v Speaker 3>something like that.</v>

2984
02:18:42.070 --> 02:18:42.370
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2985
02:18:42.390 --> 02:18:43.540
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

2987
02:18:47.380 --> 02:18:52.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well that was what you've got in the </v>

2988
02:18:52.380 --> 02:18:55.201
<v Speaker 3>nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there were guys from the eighties </v>

2989
02:18:55.201 --> 02:18:55.360
<v Speaker 3>because it was a big wave in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>eighties.</v>

2990
02:18:55.630 --> 02:19:00.340
<v Speaker 3>The wave was like from 80,</v>
<v Speaker 3>early eighties to like late eighties and</v>

2991
02:19:00.341 --> 02:19:02.590
<v Speaker 3>then it started to die off into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>nineties.</v>

2992
02:19:02.760 --> 02:19:07.760
<v Speaker 3>The comedy clubs started closing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Boston scene collapsed like all </v>

2993
02:19:07.760 --> 02:19:09.250
<v Speaker 3>those evening at the Improv shows kind </v>
<v Speaker 3>of drifted away.</v>

2994
02:19:09.580 --> 02:19:14.580
<v Speaker 3>There was a bunch of those shows for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>while and then they slowly all faded </v>

2995
02:19:14.580 --> 02:19:18.121
<v Speaker 3>away and that was in the early nineties </v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's what I came around at the </v>

2996
02:19:18.121 --> 02:19:18.610
<v Speaker 3>leftovers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2997
02:19:18.700 --> 02:19:21.730
<v Speaker 3>There was so much bad comedy and there </v>
<v Speaker 3>was a very few people.</v>

2998
02:19:21.970 --> 02:19:25.420
<v Speaker 3>There's no one from my era that started </v>
<v Speaker 3>off in [inaudible] 94.</v>

2999
02:19:25.421 --> 02:19:27.250
<v Speaker 3>That's around today.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

3000
02:19:27.590 --> 02:19:30.620
<v Speaker 3>At the comedy store.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one knowing that I could think of.</v>

3001
02:19:30.650 --> 02:19:34.220
<v Speaker 3>I can't think of one guy who was with me</v>
<v Speaker 3>back then who was in my state.</v>

3002
02:19:35.060 --> 02:19:38.420
<v Speaker 3>I was already headlining on the road and</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had a television show,</v>

3003
02:19:38.780 --> 02:19:43.780
<v Speaker 3>but realistically I've learned how to do</v>
<v Speaker 3>standing up at the store and that's bad </v>

3004
02:19:43.780 --> 02:19:43.780
<v Speaker 3>ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Realistically.</v>

3005
02:19:43.780 --> 02:19:44.960
<v Speaker 3>That's me too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's her.</v>

3006
02:19:44.961 --> 02:19:48.620
<v Speaker 3>I learned some jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew a little bit about comedy,</v>

3007
02:19:48.621 --> 02:19:53.621
<v Speaker 3>but I learned.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really learned that at the store that </v>

3008
02:19:53.621 --> 02:19:55.830
<v Speaker 3>are just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it changes all rules and it gets you</v>

3009
02:19:56.391 --> 02:19:57.680
<v Speaker 3>ready when you're out on the road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Go,</v>

3010
02:19:57.710 --> 02:19:59.900
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I seen this in the belly rooms.</v>

3011
02:19:59.901 --> 02:20:04.901
<v Speaker 3>The or compressed to a diamond valley </v>
<v Speaker 3>runs like a half of our half the alarm.</v>

3012
02:20:06.070 --> 02:20:08.050
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a fort.</v>

3013
02:20:08.090 --> 02:20:12.350
<v Speaker 3>I call it a comedy for go upstairs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're in the fort,</v>

3014
02:20:12.410 --> 02:20:17.410
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and it just feels good and you're </v>

3015
02:20:17.410 --> 02:20:19.061
<v Speaker 3>looking at naked pictures to collapses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially like those Roast Battle </v>

3016
02:20:20.490 --> 02:20:22.230
<v Speaker 3>Knights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even like going up there.</v>

3017
02:20:23.010 --> 02:20:24.470
<v Speaker 3>This is going to go in the kitchen.</v>

3018
02:20:29.500 --> 02:20:32.040
<v Speaker 3>Too many.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean not enough people in here.</v>

3019
02:20:32.620 --> 02:20:37.620
<v Speaker 3>It's great now with periscope though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because all of us just sit and watch it </v>

3023
02:20:45.051 --> 02:20:50.051
<v Speaker 3>is though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that some people that are outside of it </v>

3024
02:20:50.051 --> 02:20:50.051
<v Speaker 3>are not going to get it and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to get angry.</v>

02:23:09.780 --> 02:23:11.190
<v Speaker 11>Fuck this,</v>
<v Speaker 11>I need a cigarette.</v>

3086
02:23:11.250 --> 02:23:14.440
<v Speaker 11>I stub my toe,</v>
<v Speaker 11>scuffed my new sneakers.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You got a need to escape.</v>

3089
02:23:22.360 --> 02:23:27.360
<v Speaker 1>Then you've got to be really careful </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that because you're doing </v>

3090
02:23:27.360 --> 02:23:29.540
<v Speaker 1>something that's going to eventually </v>
<v Speaker 1>give you an illness and you know,</v>

3091
02:23:29.541 --> 02:23:32.270
<v Speaker 1>most likely one of those incurable ones </v>
<v Speaker 1>like lung cancer.</v>

3092
02:23:32.360 --> 02:23:33.920
<v Speaker 1>And if that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

3093
02:23:34.280 --> 02:23:37.730
<v Speaker 1>you'll be thinking like Johnny Carson </v>
<v Speaker 1>was like Johnny Carson before he died,</v>

3094
02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:43.000
<v Speaker 1>would just walk around the house with an</v>
<v Speaker 1>oxygen mask and go those fucking </v>

3095
02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:43.940
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes and that's all he would say.</v>

<v Speaker 2>of my life.</v>

3122
02:24:49.031 --> 02:24:49.031
<v Speaker 11>talked to these people and they're like,</v>

<v Speaker 11>it's everyone seems like they're on </v>
<v Speaker 11>something for some of the mistakes that </v>

3125
02:24:56.090 --> 02:24:56.600
<v Speaker 11>people are trying to solve.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Medical.</v>

3126
02:24:56.601 --> 02:24:56.870
<v Speaker 11>Yeah,</v>

3127
02:24:56.970 --> 02:24:57.440
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3128
02:24:58.110 --> 02:25:00.570
<v Speaker 2>I've tried to go the full clean route </v>
<v Speaker 2>and be like,</v>

3129
02:25:00.571 --> 02:25:03.130
<v Speaker 2>just to see like my memory is fire right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

3130
02:25:03.131 --> 02:25:06.510
<v Speaker 2>I quit caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My memory is incredible</v>

3131
02:25:06.730 --> 02:25:11.730
<v Speaker 11>because you quit caffeine so it was all </v>
<v Speaker 11>Kinda just drink like 10 coffees a day.</v>

3132
02:25:12.220 --> 02:25:16.010
<v Speaker 11>Then I'd be on stage and just be like </v>
<v Speaker 11>bird man.</v>

3133
02:25:16.250 --> 02:25:18.010
<v Speaker 11>Like sometimes they get a twitch up </v>
<v Speaker 11>here.</v>

3134
02:25:18.011 --> 02:25:19.690
<v Speaker 11>Too much caffeine.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Do you ever get that?</v>

3135
02:25:19.691 --> 02:25:21.730
<v Speaker 11>It's twitching here while you're </v>
<v Speaker 11>onstage.</v>

3136
02:25:21.760 --> 02:25:24.130
<v Speaker 11>Is that what that's from?</v>
<v Speaker 11>From caffeine</v>

3137
02:25:24.130 --> 02:25:27.600
<v Speaker 12>or sleep deprivation and it wind stop </v>
<v Speaker 12>and they'd be like,</v>

3138
02:25:27.640 --> 02:25:30.510
<v Speaker 12>God damn it.</v>
<v Speaker 12>My guys are doctors.</v>

3139
02:25:30.520 --> 02:25:33.680

<v Speaker 12>I'm getting canker sores from mentos and</v>

3140
02:25:33.970 --> 02:25:36.950
<v Speaker 12>this guy's getting twitches from coffee </v>
<v Speaker 12>for sure.</v>

3141
02:25:37.660 --> 02:25:42.660
<v Speaker 12>Definitely from the coffee fucking 25 </v>
<v Speaker 12>years.</v>

3142
02:25:43.361 --> 02:25:45.250
<v Speaker 12>You were stuffing it through your </v>
<v Speaker 12>fucking nose.</v>

3143
02:25:45.470 --> 02:25:50.470
<v Speaker 12>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I've had some close calls on coke five </v>

3144
02:25:50.470 --> 02:25:54.310
<v Speaker 12>calls.</v>
<v Speaker 12>I had the numb arm in Marin,</v>

3145
02:25:54.311 --> 02:25:59.110
<v Speaker 12>had an MRI dated a bit about it,</v>
<v Speaker 12>but I was in Laurel Canyon.</v>

3146
02:25:59.111 --> 02:26:03.340
<v Speaker 12>I remember there was just the first time</v>
<v Speaker 12>I ever really saw pyramid a coke,</v>

3147
02:26:03.370 --> 02:26:05.680
<v Speaker 12>like people tried to do that because the</v>
<v Speaker 12>scarface,</v>

3148
02:26:06.130 --> 02:26:07.180
<v Speaker 12>you go to parties,</v>
<v Speaker 12>Nigga,</v>

3149
02:26:07.181 --> 02:26:11.140
<v Speaker 12>they had a pyramid of how many people </v>
<v Speaker 12>are stealing it.</v>

3150
02:26:11.141 --> 02:26:14.620
<v Speaker 12>Like putting them in touch with you </v>
<v Speaker 12>think.</v>

3151
02:26:14.621 --> 02:26:15.580
<v Speaker 12>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 12>But,</v>

3152
02:26:15.610 --> 02:26:18.370
<v Speaker 12>but like the people that are there,</v>
<v Speaker 12>they're just like,</v>

3153
02:26:18.371 --> 02:26:19.540
<v Speaker 12>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 12>there's plenty of coke,</v>

3154
02:26:19.541 --> 02:26:21.610
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>how much does something like that cost,</v>

3155
02:26:21.611 --> 02:26:24.070
<v Speaker 12>like a pyramid would probably be a key </v>
<v Speaker 12>of coke,</v>

3156
02:26:24.071 --> 02:26:27.150
<v Speaker 12>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>like I don't know,</v>

3157
02:26:27.160 --> 02:26:27.890
<v Speaker 12>back then what?</v>

3158
02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:32.620
<v Speaker 12>That's big money like a back then and </v>
<v Speaker 12>eight ball was 3:50.</v>

3159
02:26:32.621 --> 02:26:34.660
<v Speaker 12>Three and a half grams.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Okay.</v>

3160
02:26:34.661 --> 02:26:36.670
<v Speaker 12>Well look,</v>
<v Speaker 12>just give me a guesstimate.</v>

3161
02:26:36.700 --> 02:26:38.770
<v Speaker 12>Let's say 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 12>bucks.</v>

3162
02:26:38.771 --> 02:26:40.900
<v Speaker 12>10,000.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Well you think about the amount of money</v>

3163
02:26:40.901 --> 02:26:43.840
<v Speaker 12>to some people spend on parties just for</v>
<v Speaker 12>like catering and shit.</v>

3164
02:26:43.841 --> 02:26:44.260
<v Speaker 12>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 12>right.</v>

3165
02:26:44.440 --> 02:26:47.470
<v Speaker 12>Having a band play and fucking ice </v>
<v Speaker 12>sculpture,</v>

3166
02:26:47.830 --> 02:26:50.290
<v Speaker 12>why not have a big giant brick of coke?</v>
<v Speaker 12>Yeah,</v>

3167
02:26:50.380 --> 02:26:52.600
<v Speaker 12>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 12>And it looked pretty impressive when you</v>

3168
02:26:52.601 --> 02:26:55.720
<v Speaker 12>come in and go,</v>
<v Speaker 12>well that's an actual pyramid of coke,</v>

3169
02:26:56.170 --> 02:26:57.910
<v Speaker 12>but if you got busted,</v>
<v Speaker 12>if the cops came,</v>

3170
02:26:57.911 --> 02:27:00.610
<v Speaker 12>they probably busted for distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 12>That's prison there.</v>

3171
02:27:00.611 --> 02:27:01.450
<v Speaker 12>That's a key.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 12>pile off of it and oh my God.</v>

02:33:15.690 --> 02:33:15.690
<v Speaker 11>off.</v>
<v Speaker 11>That's basically the,</v>

3309
02:33:15.720 --> 02:33:20.360
<v Speaker 11>the whole recipe of the playboy mansion.</v>
<v Speaker 11>A lot of ways.</v>

3310
02:33:20.361 --> 02:33:20.690
<v Speaker 11>Yeah.</v>

3311
02:33:20.960 --> 02:33:25.960
<v Speaker 1>Well there was a house that I looked at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was one point in time where I was </v>

3312
02:33:25.960 --> 02:33:26.350
<v Speaker 1>thinking I should probably live in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood hills,</v>

3313
02:33:26.380 --> 02:33:28.660
<v Speaker 1>be easier to get to the store and I get </v>
<v Speaker 1>home quicker,</v>

3314
02:33:28.700 --> 02:33:31.310
<v Speaker 1>get more work done and be like I could </v>
<v Speaker 1>live anywhere.</v>

3315
02:33:31.400 --> 02:33:33.230
<v Speaker 1>I thought about it for a very short </v>
<v Speaker 1>period of time,</v>

3316
02:33:33.231 --> 02:33:38.231
<v Speaker 1>like maybe a couple of weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I looked at this one house and the </v>

3317
02:33:38.231 --> 02:33:38.480
<v Speaker 1>House that I looked at was a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>cool.</v>

3318
02:33:38.481 --> 02:33:43.481
<v Speaker 1>And this guy had this glass back window,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like his entire back of his house was </v>

3319
02:33:43.481 --> 02:33:46.550
<v Speaker 1>glass and he was a guy that invented </v>
<v Speaker 1>bell bottoms.</v>

3320
02:33:46.800 --> 02:33:48.800
<v Speaker 1>Allegedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was a story behind this guy.</v>

3321
02:33:49.070 --> 02:33:50.930
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they used to call them wild man.</v>

3322
02:33:50.931 --> 02:33:55.931
<v Speaker 1>This case to show up at it is when Eddie</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bravo was a DJ script strip club and uh,</v>

3323
02:33:56.510 --> 02:33:59.600
<v Speaker 1>Eddie used to work at the Strip club and</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy was rich as fuck.</v>

3324
02:33:59.840 --> 02:34:04.840
<v Speaker 1>And he would come in and he would pay a </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit load of money to get these girls </v>

3325
02:34:04.840 --> 02:34:09.191
<v Speaker 1>come back to his place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would go to strip clubs all </v>

3326
02:34:09.191 --> 02:34:09.191
<v Speaker 1>throughout the valley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go everywhere wanted you,</v>

3327
02:34:09.191 --> 02:34:13.571
<v Speaker 1>had like a whole place that he would go </v>
<v Speaker 1>during the day and he would get these </v>

3328
02:34:13.571 --> 02:34:16.631
<v Speaker 1>girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the story was that this guy was a </v>

3329
02:34:16.631 --> 02:34:18.100
<v Speaker 1>straight laced guy who smoked a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cigarettes and he went</v>

3330
02:34:18.100 --> 02:34:20.650
<v Speaker 3>to the doctor and the doctor said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen man,</v>

3331
02:34:20.651 --> 02:34:22.330
<v Speaker 3>you're going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to stop smoking.</v>

3332
02:34:22.331 --> 02:34:23.560
<v Speaker 3>Cigarettes are going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look,</v>

3333
02:34:23.561 --> 02:34:25.210
<v Speaker 3>if you need to smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 3>smoke weed.</v>

3334
02:34:25.720 --> 02:34:26.710
<v Speaker 3>I smoke pot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not.</v>

3335
02:34:26.711 --> 02:34:31.711
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't give you cancer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this guy starts smoking pot joints </v>

3336
02:34:31.711 --> 02:34:32.830
<v Speaker 3>all day long.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just changes his life.</v>

3337
02:34:33.100 --> 02:34:33.950
<v Speaker 3>Decides,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what man,</v>

3338
02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:35.830
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to work anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I have money.</v>

3339
02:34:36.050 --> 02:34:41.050
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm gonna do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to just play guitar and I'm </v>

3340
02:34:41.050 --> 02:34:43.651
<v Speaker 3>going to get hookers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So this guy decided to do just play </v>

3341
02:34:43.651 --> 02:34:46.861
<v Speaker 3>guitar and get hookers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but apparently he was really mean to </v>

3342
02:34:46.861 --> 02:34:49.261
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is sort of the opposite of what </v>

3343
02:34:49.261 --> 02:34:49.261
<v Speaker 3>you expect from potheads,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3344
02:34:49.261 --> 02:34:52.180
<v Speaker 3>That's filed bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Expect gentle and apparently he used to,</v>

3345
02:34:52.270 --> 02:34:55.260
<v Speaker 3>he used to call it like bootcamping them</v>
<v Speaker 3>bootcamp.</v>

3346
02:34:55.360 --> 02:34:58.240
<v Speaker 3>These girls who treat them like shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who pay him a lot of money,</v>

3347
02:34:58.380 --> 02:34:59.440
<v Speaker 3>do you treat them like shit.</v>

3348
02:34:59.440 --> 02:35:04.440
<v Speaker 3>And he got off on the fact that he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>as gross old guy and he would get these </v>

3349
02:35:04.440 --> 02:35:05.100
<v Speaker 3>hot young girls and you would do mean </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff to,</v>

3350
02:35:05.110 --> 02:35:10.110
<v Speaker 3>oh well this guy was selling his house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I went to look at the house and I </v>

3351
02:35:10.601 --> 02:35:12.070
<v Speaker 3>remember looking around and I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>thinking,</v>

3352
02:35:12.100 --> 02:35:15.700
<v Speaker 3>well this house is really expensive and </v>
<v Speaker 3>it's right there on the street.</v>

3353
02:35:15.970 --> 02:35:19.300
<v Speaker 3>And then I remember thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy has been bringing these hookers</v>

3354
02:35:19.301 --> 02:35:24.301
<v Speaker 3>back to this place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was like a lot of people are </v>

3355
02:35:24.301 --> 02:35:25.900
<v Speaker 3>probably going to think that this guy is</v>
<v Speaker 3>an asshole and then going to rob them or</v>

3356
02:35:25.901 --> 02:35:26.260
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3357
02:35:26.261 --> 02:35:28.540
<v Speaker 3>what if I buy it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they go looking for wild man.</v>

3358
02:35:28.541 --> 02:35:28.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yo,</v>

3359
02:35:28.961 --> 02:35:33.961
<v Speaker 3>I live here now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking two weeks after I thought that </v>

3360
02:35:33.961 --> 02:35:37.540
<v Speaker 3>he was killed in that house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He brought a girl home and a.</v>

3361
02:35:37.810 --> 02:35:42.810
<v Speaker 3>apparently the girl brought guys with </v>
<v Speaker 3>her and they fucking shot him in the </v>

3362
02:35:42.810 --> 02:35:46.321
<v Speaker 3>neck style,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shot him in the neck and he bled out </v>

3363
02:35:46.321 --> 02:35:48.280
<v Speaker 3>right in the front where I was walking </v>
<v Speaker 3>around looking around.</v>

3364
02:35:48.650 --> 02:35:50.400
<v Speaker 3>Why when I was looking around his house,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go on,</v>

3365
02:35:50.410 --> 02:35:52.210
<v Speaker 3>this fucking guy could get shot and this</v>
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

3366
02:35:53.560 --> 02:35:56.200
<v Speaker 3>It was funny because I brought that up </v>
<v Speaker 3>and the guy was selling the house,</v>

3367
02:35:56.201 --> 02:35:57.130
<v Speaker 3>the real estate guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

3368
02:35:57.370 --> 02:36:02.370
<v Speaker 3>don't worry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a state of the art security </v>

3369
02:36:02.370 --> 02:36:02.370
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>

<v Speaker 3>That trial.</v>

3373

<v Speaker 3>When I say that to the guy,</v>

3374
02:36:09.731 --> 02:36:11.090
<v Speaker 3>the guy was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>of fear factor,</v>

3399
02:37:20.690 --> 02:37:24.950
<v Speaker 1>I say with a grain of salt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the idea that someone would,</v>

3400
02:37:25.040 --> 02:37:30.040
<v Speaker 1>that that's what they get off on to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>off on taking someone who desperately </v>

3401
02:37:30.040 --> 02:37:33.431
<v Speaker 1>needs the money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bringing them to their own house where </v>

<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he had that raspy cigarette voice.</v>

<v Speaker 12>It's good for the size.</v>

3454
02:39:46.751 --> 02:39:51.751
<v Speaker 12>For one bedroom.</v>
<v Speaker 12>It's like a massive studio was separate </v>

02:39:51.751 --> 02:39:55.741
<v Speaker 12>kitchen everything,</v>
<v Speaker 12>but you got to a garage and stay for </v>

<v Speaker 12>apartment.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Totally.</v>

<v Speaker 4>excuse to not have to contribute.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when you're dealing with starving,</v>

3557
02:44:13.451 --> 02:44:18.451
<v Speaker 4>struggling artist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the same sort of mentality that </v>

3558
02:44:18.451 --> 02:44:18.451
<v Speaker 4>makes people flick cigarettes out the </v>
<v Speaker 4>window.</v>

3559
02:44:18.451 --> 02:44:19.620
<v Speaker 4>It's not thinking about anybody but </v>
<v Speaker 4>themselves.</v>

3560
02:44:19.621 --> 02:44:20.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

3561

<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a cigarette thing too,</v>

3562
02:44:22.511 --> 02:44:24.490

3563
02:44:24.491 --> 02:44:26.530
<v Speaker 4>with cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've always wondered,</v>

3564
02:44:26.531 --> 02:44:28.010
<v Speaker 4>like I was hanging out with the tally of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the day.</v>

3565
02:44:28.011 --> 02:44:29.230
<v Speaker 4>I didn't bring it up because I love </v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

3566
02:44:29.231 --> 02:44:31.180
<v Speaker 4>but smoke cigarette dropped on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ground,</v>

3567
02:44:31.181 --> 02:44:32.350
<v Speaker 4>stepped on it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>left it there,</v>

3568
02:44:32.590 --> 02:44:33.220
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's littering.</v>

3570
02:44:34.511 --> 02:44:36.280
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what'd you do that with a rapper?</v>

3571
02:44:36.310 --> 02:44:39.880
<v Speaker 4>Would you do that with like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a glamorized growing up,</v>

3572

<v Speaker 4>with James,</v>

3573
02:44:40.721 --> 02:44:43.410
<v Speaker 4>Deane stepping on the cigarette or </v>
<v Speaker 4>flicking it.</v>

3574
02:44:43.411 --> 02:44:46.750
<v Speaker 4>It used to always be like a thing that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you mean cops would,</v>

3575
02:44:46.751 --> 02:44:48.140
<v Speaker 4>do you know it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it never was.</v>

3576
02:44:48.640 --> 02:44:51.880
<v Speaker 4>It never was considered a lender.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They sent me to the end like and then we</v>

3577
02:44:51.881 --> 02:44:52.990

3581
02:45:12.140 --> 02:45:15.320

<v Speaker 4>fucking Prius.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's up to eight people in a prius throw</v>
<v Speaker 4>cigarette out the window.</v>

02:45:25.640 --> 02:45:30.640
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't tell me you're driving that Prius </v>

3586
02:45:30.640 --> 02:45:31.600

<v Speaker 4>They're cheap.</v>

3587
02:45:32.600 --> 02:45:34.080
<v Speaker 4>You can try one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

3588
02:45:34.170 --> 02:45:36.140
<v Speaker 4>Daniel Cormier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the UFC light heavyweight champ.</v>

3589
02:45:36.260 --> 02:45:41.260
<v Speaker 4>He has won and he said it costs like 30 </v>
<v Speaker 4>bucks to fill up and it lasts a month.</v>

3590
02:45:42.410 --> 02:45:42.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went to,</v>

3591
02:45:43.070 --> 02:45:45.280
<v Speaker 4>I went to San Fran with another comic </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it,</v>

3592
02:45:45.350 --> 02:45:48.500
<v Speaker 4>we put like $26 and we were there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

3593
02:45:48.560 --> 02:45:50.840
<v Speaker 4>are you kidding?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like my motorcycle.</v>

3594
02:45:50.841 --> 02:45:53.840
<v Speaker 4>I stopped three times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're great on gas,</v>

3595
02:45:53.900 --> 02:45:57.650
<v Speaker 4>but their dog shit cars just killed it </v>
<v Speaker 4>for me.</v>

3596
02:45:57.651 --> 02:46:01.260
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been in so many Prius's lately that</v>

3597
02:46:01.750 --> 02:46:05.330
<v Speaker 4>every uber driver has.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One is the track home of cars.</v>

3598
02:46:05.690 --> 02:46:07.640
<v Speaker 4>That's what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a track home.</v>

3599
02:46:07.880 --> 02:46:10.190
<v Speaker 4>They all look the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You just go</v>

3600
02:46:10.190 --> 02:46:11.270
<v Speaker 12>in and go,</v>
<v Speaker 12>where's mine?</v>

3601
02:46:11.271 --> 02:46:15.200
<v Speaker 12>Do you ever leave the arclight and you </v>
<v Speaker 12>go look at the fucking Prius is in here.</v>

3602
02:46:16.870 --> 02:46:17.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all it is,</v>

3603
02:46:17.601 --> 02:46:20.390
<v Speaker 1>is everybody had one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't be so dangerous.</v>

3604
02:46:20.780 --> 02:46:23.510
<v Speaker 1>The problem is other people have fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>trucks,</v>

3605
02:46:24.260 --> 02:46:26.180
<v Speaker 1>semis and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you have a prius.</v>

3606
02:46:26.660 --> 02:46:31.610
<v Speaker 1>Prius get hit by a semi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After I got rear ended,</v>

3607
02:46:31.611 --> 02:46:36.611
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started really reconsidering the type </v>

3608
02:46:36.611 --> 02:46:38.321
<v Speaker 1>of automobile I drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Porsche took the hit pretty good </v>

3609
02:46:38.321 --> 02:46:42.851
<v Speaker 1>because it's designed German engineering</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as a crash beam in the back that </v>

3610
02:46:42.851 --> 02:46:45.020
<v Speaker 1>absorbs the impact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't get hit that hard either.</v>

3611
02:46:45.050 --> 02:46:45.860
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3612
02:46:45.900 --> 02:46:48.080
<v Speaker 1>you think about all these fucking idiots</v>
<v Speaker 1>out there.</v>

3613
02:46:48.081 --> 02:46:53.081
<v Speaker 1>Like I told you about van Owen Street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these caved in cars from assholes that </v>

3614
02:46:53.081 --> 02:46:55.190
<v Speaker 1>are just texting or sleeping or whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fuck they're doing.</v>

3615
02:46:55.610 --> 02:46:57.800
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem with driving as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other people.</v>

3616
02:46:58.180 --> 02:46:59.960
<v Speaker 1>You're dealing with so many variables.</v>

3617
02:47:00.070 --> 02:47:05.070
<v Speaker 12>It's none of them have insurance either.</v>
<v Speaker 12>Half these people on our roads don't </v>

3618
02:47:05.070 --> 02:47:06.460
<v Speaker 12>even have licenses and insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 12>whatever.</v>

3619
02:47:07.100 --> 02:47:08.410
<v Speaker 12>It's brutal out there,</v>
<v Speaker 12>man.</v>

3620
02:47:08.411 --> 02:47:11.610
<v Speaker 12>I'm on a motorcycle and I just couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 12>laugh like you.</v>

3621
02:47:12.340 --> 02:47:14.020
<v Speaker 12>I'll look right at a guy,</v>
<v Speaker 12>Joe.</v>

3622
02:47:14.080 --> 02:47:16.600
<v Speaker 12>I'm riding.</v>
<v Speaker 12>That guy will look at me.</v>

3623
02:47:17.080 --> 02:47:20.800
<v Speaker 12>He'll look like this.</v>
<v Speaker 12>He sees me put his blinker on.</v>

3624
02:47:20.801 --> 02:47:22.990
<v Speaker 12>It just starts coming over.</v>
<v Speaker 12>He doesn't give a fuck.</v>

3625
02:47:23.170 --> 02:47:25.660

<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3637

<v Speaker 12>I've been here.</v>

3643
02:48:02.130 --> 02:48:02.600
<v Speaker 12>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 12>it's,</v>

3644
02:48:02.680 --> 02:48:07.340
<v Speaker 12>I should find whoever has that fucking </v>
<v Speaker 12>BMW beat the fucking shit out of him.</v>

3645

<v Speaker 1>somebody now.</v>

3763
02:52:55.710 --> 02:53:00.710
<v Speaker 1>How prevalent it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This woman was talking about this ex </v>

3764
02:53:00.710 --> 02:53:01.260
<v Speaker 1>boyfriend that she had that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>blackmailing her and said,</v>

3765
02:53:01.261 --> 02:53:02.910
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have another boyfriend,</v>

3766
02:53:02.911 --> 02:53:07.911
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fucking tell them and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to send them sex tapes that we </v>

3767
02:53:07.911 --> 02:53:10.680
<v Speaker 1>made together and was saying that I want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to haunt you for the rest of your life.</v>

3768
02:53:10.830 --> 02:53:15.830
<v Speaker 1>So she invited the guy over her house </v>
<v Speaker 1>and she was cooking dinner for him and </v>

3769
02:53:15.830 --> 02:53:15.830
<v Speaker 1>she was going to stab him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

3770
02:53:15.870 --> 02:53:20.870
<v Speaker 1>And she had the knife in her hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Guy ran away and they asked her </v>

3771
02:53:20.870 --> 02:53:20.870
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how close were you stabbing him?</v>

3772
02:53:21.120 --> 02:53:23.790
<v Speaker 1>She was like 60 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>60 percent established.</v>

3773
02:53:24.120 --> 02:53:25.710
<v Speaker 1>She was thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this guy wasn't in my life,</v>

3774
02:53:25.740 --> 02:53:30.740
<v Speaker 1>I could be happy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so she was just going to stab him </v>

3775
02:53:30.740 --> 02:53:34.311
<v Speaker 1>like she was so maniacal about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you've got to think how many people </v>

3776
02:53:34.311 --> 02:53:34.311
<v Speaker 1>get that close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3777
02:53:34.311 --> 02:53:36.510
<v Speaker 1>but this is a normal person who got that</v>
<v Speaker 1>close.</v>

3778
02:53:36.550 --> 02:53:37.410
<v Speaker 1>They got that close.</v>

3779
02:53:37.480 --> 02:53:41.480
<v Speaker 12>That's crazy because then the,</v>
<v Speaker 12>the next five minutes,</v>

3780
02:53:41.510 --> 02:53:43.640
<v Speaker 12>your whole life changes and you go to </v>
<v Speaker 12>prison.</v>

3781
02:53:44.500 --> 02:53:44.850
<v Speaker 12>You know,</v>

3782
02:53:45.450 --> 02:53:47.940
<v Speaker 1>I would give her a free pass.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd give her a pass.</v>

3783
02:53:48.170 --> 02:53:53.170
<v Speaker 1>You guys a con?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's trying to fucking say she could </v>

3784
02:53:53.170 --> 02:53:53.170
<v Speaker 1>never have a boyfriend again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's going to send the out.</v>

3785
02:53:53.170 --> 02:53:57.920

<v Speaker 1>Apparently he was according to her </v>

3786
02:53:57.920 --> 02:53:58.890
<v Speaker 1>vicious asshole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're a woman,</v>

<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this the shit that you have to deal </v>

<v Speaker 1>frightening shit.</v>

3791

<v Speaker 1>someone on a bike.</v>

3792
