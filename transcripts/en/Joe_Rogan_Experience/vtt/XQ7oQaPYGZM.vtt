1
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.930
Wait is great.
Oh,
okay.

2
00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.380
The Joe Rogan experience podcast is brought to you by camera's seen games maker

3
00:00:13.381 --> 00:00:14.850
of bullied slinger.

4
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.710
What's blade slinger blades linger is the first video game that's being released

5
00:00:19.711 --> 00:00:23.190
by kerosene games.
A new company,
a startup.

6
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.250
We believe in them bur roadie Stevens would say positive energy.

7
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.880
Um,
we were taking a chance with them because I think they're doing everything

8
00:00:32.881 --> 00:00:33.241
right.

9
00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:38.241
And what their goal is is to make really fun bad ass games for the IPAD and the

10
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.550
iPhone and android devices.

11
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.450
The idea being that most of the games you're getting like the really good games.

12
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.440
Like if you,
uh,
even like doom or something like that,
they're porting them.

13
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.120
What are you doing is playing the noise?

14
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.590
You have like a soundboard now are you going Adam Carolla on me,
bitch,
they,
um,

15
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:56.061
they,

16
00:00:56.061 --> 00:01:00.230
they've made these games specifically for the IPAD instead of it being ported

17
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.560
over.
So all the,
the,
the controls are very intuitive.
And with the,

18
00:01:04.561 --> 00:01:09.090
the graphics power that you have now on iPads,
it's just fucking incredible.

19
00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:11.400
You can play like really high resolution,

20
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.600
just unbelievably beautiful games.
They're really fucking fun.

21
00:01:15.601 --> 00:01:19.500
So if you're into like wasting your time and getting your life sucked into a

22
00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:24.330
little piece of metal and glass and I know you are and as I am as well.

23
00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.810
Uh,
it's a,
it's an excellent game.
It's only two 99,
so it's very reasonable.

24
00:01:27.811 --> 00:01:31.590
It's called Blade slinger and it's by kerosene games and you can get it right

25
00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:35.430
now on the iPad and I believe it will be available next month on android games,

26
00:01:35.431 --> 00:01:38.340
but it's available for iPad and iPhone right now.

27
00:01:38.341 --> 00:01:42.540
You're dirty fucks were also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com that's o,
n n,

28
00:01:42.541 --> 00:01:47.541
I t and Brian Cowen was just in here bragging about the hemp force protein.

29
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.350
I really,
so yeah,
that's amaze.
Fucking delicious.
You know,
why is this?

30
00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.730
I'd be like,
there's other protein that you can buy,
like hemp protein that is,
um,

31
00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.590
it's,
it's good.
You know,
you'll get protein out of it,
but it's much grittier.

32
00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.340
It's a,
it's got a different set of keys to that,
that the,
the,

33
00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.510
the chocolate nature of it is so delicious.
And those bars,

34
00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:12.840
I've eaten every brother.
Next time we'd go hunting.
I'm bringing all the,

35
00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:15.870
I'm bringing,
that's what I'm bringing those guys.
They're so good for you,

36
00:02:15.871 --> 00:02:19.500
but they're just that delicious.
Those buffalo bars.
And then not only that,

37
00:02:19.501 --> 00:02:24.380
the protein bars,
the protein bars were making the hemp protein bars.
It's the,

38
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.670
with hemp protein.
Um,
there's varying levels of,
uh,

39
00:02:29.671 --> 00:02:34.671
of protein content and varying levels of a refinement.

40
00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.260
Like the best protein is like,
it has a,
the best hemp protein,

41
00:02:40.261 --> 00:02:43.800
the best hemp hearts have a higher level of protein,
but it's more expensive.

42
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.230
It's hard to get that.
Well,
that's what we get and we,

43
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.650
it's harder to get to the point where we can only buy 50 pounds of it a day.

44
00:02:49.651 --> 00:02:52.530
So we run out of hemp for sometimes because it's so fucking delicious.

45
00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.220
I'm not playing the shit up.
It's got raw cocoa in it.
It's got Maca in it.

46
00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.640
I'm telling you it is.
The best stuff in the wash is fucking no sugar,

47
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.250
no sugar.
This one gram of sugar,

48
00:03:03.251 --> 00:03:06.920
which is just sort of naturally occurring from the,
uh,
probably from a,

49
00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:11.650
just from the vegetable matter,
but it's,
um,
sweetened with Stevia,
which,
uh,

50
00:03:11.651 --> 00:03:13.570
in low doses like you're getting with this is,

51
00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:17.920
it's Stevia is incredibly strong and you don't have to put much in it to sweeten

52
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:21.730
things.
Like if you ever put Stevia in your coffee,
you'll really fuck up.

53
00:03:21.731 --> 00:03:24.670
If you go with a full tablespoon.
Brian,
you've done that before,
right?

54
00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:25.230
Remember when we were,

55
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.660
we had Stevie at the house and you were accidentally like put too much and
crazy.

56
00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.150
It's crazy.
Yeah,
it's really sweet.

57
00:03:31.151 --> 00:03:34.720
And it's weight gets the perfect like for this,
for hemp force,

58
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.290
it's really the perfect sweetener because it is unbelievably healthy.

59
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.800
Like if you look at what's in,
you know,
from,

60
00:03:40.801 --> 00:03:45.790
from the protein to the Makkah to the,
um,
to the rock,
what does Maka Maka has?

61
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.490
It's a,
um,
well,
I'll Google it so I know exactly.
So I don't misspeak,

62
00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:51.260
but it's a nutritional supplement as well.

63
00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.990
Some crucial testosterone and all of a sudden man was supposed to get,

64
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.650
you don't dare call it is,

65
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.930
I think it's from a root or protein.
Right.
So it's um,

66
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.260
hold on a second.
I'll find out what the to not have some kind of,

67
00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.020
I'm going to find out exactly,
exactly.
Maka shit be haunting over.

68
00:04:10.021 --> 00:04:12.760
It's actually,
that's interesting.
It's also a nickname.

69
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.110
It's a nickname for English speaking countries of Anglo Saxon heritage.

70
00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:22.300
Hmm.
Huh.
That's weird.
I've never heard of that before.

71
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.370
At a certain time,
you know,

72
00:04:24.371 --> 00:04:28.180
you got to let shit go get your nickname would be if you are a fighter.
No,

73
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.740
I wouldn't mind my payment.
Maka Maka Callan.
There's a gross man.

74
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.530
You make your own.
Make your own.
Like fucking the dinosaur from hill.

75
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.570
I would call me like Brian the sometimes irritable Callahan is this shit.

76
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.390
Right?
Okay.
It's a root.
Yeah.

77
00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:49.420
From the Andes in South America.
A root.

78
00:04:49.421 --> 00:04:51.280
It's a member of the radish family.

79
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.530
It's been a long forgotten herb until recently apparently when people started

80
00:04:56.531 --> 00:05:00.940
using it again.
Any updates on that ting situation?

81
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:03.340
Yes.
The Ting I fucked up.
They,

82
00:05:03.341 --> 00:05:07.270
they did tell me that they were dropping it down to 25 bucks.

83
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.870
And I think I said that the thought there was a shitty idea,
but when I said it,

84
00:05:10.871 --> 00:05:13.100
I was high so I forgot,
I'll send emails,

85
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.100
I'm high and it's like somebody else did it cause I just fucking don't have any

86
00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:21.370
memory.
Like I looked at my own writing that this guy had sent me back.

87
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.140
I was like,
that looks like exactly how I would write it on.
And it was like,

88
00:05:26.141 --> 00:05:28.540
I guess I just had one of those books sometimes,

89
00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:31.270
especially if I get out of a tank when I get out of tank,

90
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.840
if I go into the tank blasted and then I get out for the first few hours,

91
00:05:34.841 --> 00:05:37.540
I'll write things down and then I'll come back and read them.

92
00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:41.670
And I feel like some spirit from the 15th century,
you know,
like fucking,

93
00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.040
if you're riding an old English,
I'll just write in a weird way.

94
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:47.130
And it's like really atypical,
you know,

95
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.460
just cause you're getting out of that fucking nutty experience of the tank.
Um,

96
00:05:51.461 --> 00:05:55.070
so yeah,
the same thing was a,
it is $25.
They decided to lower it.

97
00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.820
It's still a great deal if you just Google a Tang reviews.

98
00:05:58.821 --> 00:06:02.990
I was reading some last night all positive.
It's all excellent customer service.

99
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.680
There's so many excellent things about tank.
The,
the customer service,
the,

100
00:06:06.681 --> 00:06:10.250
the ethics behind the company,
the fact that there's no contracts,
you know,

101
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:13.760
the fact that they,
they,
they offer,
they give you credit on your minutes.
I mean,

102
00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:17.930
it's just,
it's a,
it's a,
the way it's set up is beautiful.
And,
um,

103
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.010
the idea that you can just cancel at any time is really what everybody supposed

104
00:06:22.011 --> 00:06:25.370
to have anyway.
That really is what everybody's supposed to have.

105
00:06:25.371 --> 00:06:28.610
You really supposed to have service that you can just quit on.

106
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:33.820
You shouldn't have to fucking get stuck in some shitty fucking contract.

107
00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:38.450
Well,
with,
um,
with ting,
it's a unlimited devices.

108
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:43.430
You have an online control account control panel where you can like see your

109
00:06:43.431 --> 00:06:47.810
usage while things are going on.
So it is no hold customer support.

110
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.210
It's a,
the way,
it's a anytime between 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM the,
uh,

111
00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.260
you call on a real person picks up the phone.

112
00:06:54.261 --> 00:06:57.350
It's like they're trying to do everything in the right way,
you know,
and I think,

113
00:06:57.351 --> 00:07:00.050
uh,
it's possible to do that and still make money.

114
00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.150
And that's the philosophy behind honored as well.

115
00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:05.150
The philosophy behind on it mostly is sell you the best shit,

116
00:07:05.151 --> 00:07:07.700
the fruit that we can find all the shit that we use.
Um,

117
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:11.420
the best in nutritional supplements,
the best vitamins,
like the purest shit,

118
00:07:11.421 --> 00:07:12.830
the purest protein powders,

119
00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.150
everything we can get the best and sell it to you at a very reasonable Bryant.

120
00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.650
I mean,
we sell those Blendtec blenders now we sell them $200 below the rent

121
00:07:21.651 --> 00:07:26.180
manufactured suggested retail price.
Um,
same thing with battle ropes.

122
00:07:26.181 --> 00:07:28.700
Like the cheapest battle ropes.
He can find everything we sell.

123
00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:31.010
We sell the best shit where we,

124
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:35.510
we have like a really unique distribution method.
I mean,
we were in,

125
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:37.190
we have all the stuff,

126
00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:41.540
we send it out ourselves and we just buy massive quantities of whatever's

127
00:07:41.541 --> 00:07:43.550
awesome.
And,
uh,
we,

128
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:47.060
we don't have to worry about this traditional methods of advertising.

129
00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.520
You also use everything you,
yeah.
Yeah.

130
00:07:49.521 --> 00:07:52.760
I would never sell you anything that I think sucks the fat one.
Yup.

131
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:55.850
Not even sucks in a little one.
I need some socks.
Socks are skinny one.

132
00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.640
We call it the Pesky truth.
You've got to live in the truth.
Yeah.

133
00:07:58.641 --> 00:08:00.950
If you don't socks,
it's,
it's not,
you know,

134
00:08:00.951 --> 00:08:03.230
and people would question that and they can question that.

135
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:07.550
But I think it's pretty evident by my actions.
If you don't think so,

136
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:10.580
please let me know.
And either you're a Douche bag or on a delusional,

137
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:15.380
one of the other,
I don't know.
I'm not,
I'm not banking on either one,
but,
uh,
I,
uh,

138
00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:16.970
what,
what I'm doing,

139
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.750
being involved in this company makes me happy and the company makes me happy

140
00:08:20.751 --> 00:08:24.620
that the people behind it or they're just super cool people,
you know,

141
00:08:24.621 --> 00:08:28.940
from Aubrey all the way on down that are trying to sell the best shit possible

142
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:30.740
at,
in a really ethical way.

143
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.710
A hundred percent money back guarantee in the first 30 pills by it.

144
00:08:33.711 --> 00:08:35.660
You don't like it,
just fucking get your money back.

145
00:08:35.661 --> 00:08:38.030
You don't have to return the product.
Nobody's trying to sell you anything.

146
00:08:38.031 --> 00:08:40.610
This sucks.
Everything that we're selling it on,

147
00:08:40.611 --> 00:08:43.580
it is just literally the best supplements possible.

148
00:08:43.580 --> 00:08:47.630
And we're bringing in more stuff every day.
We're constantly bringing in food.

149
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:52.880
We have all sorts of stuff now from,
um,
from things for children to,
you know,

150
00:08:52.881 --> 00:08:55.710
um,
different protein bars and,
you know,

151
00:08:55.711 --> 00:08:58.200
the buffalo bars and just again,

152
00:08:58.201 --> 00:09:01.620
anything that we find that we think is really good.
Vegas support protein bars.

153
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:04.140
We have the Vega powder as well,
which I like.
It's a,

154
00:09:04.141 --> 00:09:07.960
it's a hundred percent vegan protein.
Uh,
it's non hemp,
but it's,
uh,
it's,

155
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.570
you can get it like pea protein's great.
I,
I,
I take that stuff as well,

156
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:15.930
like a way,
no,
I think your body doesn't digest it as well.
It makes me Fart.

157
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:17.780
[inaudible] fart like crazy.
Yeah,

158
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:21.980
I think it's delicious and it is effective as far as what if you don't mind
fart.

159
00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:25.120
<v 2>I just don't,
I don't,
yeah,
I don't,
I don't fucking know.
And I'm processing.</v>

160
00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:28.490
<v 1>Tait Fletcher used to eat that shit and his farts,</v>

161
00:09:28.491 --> 00:09:32.690
we've talked about it ad nauseum on the show.
They were on on ball.
Unbelievable.

162
00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:36.290
Like you couldn't believe a person could make that much odor come out of their

163
00:09:36.291 --> 00:09:41.270
box.
Like old sour milk tastes gigantic sulfur teach huge,
you know,

164
00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:46.400
so he's like,
it's a 240 pound guy,
shit in this out.
So it's just like,
whoa.

165
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:49.220
And he's giant,
tall.
So it's like all this room for air.

166
00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:52.370
He can all get down and make it sound far out of his body.

167
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:55.910
Just was not the way to go.
If you want to smell someone's ass,

168
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.820
we also have killer bee.
Honey.
Why don't we have killer bee honey?

169
00:09:58.970 --> 00:10:03.970
Because killer bees sound like someone you'd behave gangster as fuck to rob and

170
00:10:04.641 --> 00:10:07.670
steal their honey.
I liked the idea behind it.
It's Hawaiian.

171
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:09.020
I don't think it's any better than regular.

172
00:10:09.910 --> 00:10:12.650
It's probably not even as good as regular honey.
I don't care.

173
00:10:13.010 --> 00:10:13.843
I'm going to take it.

174
00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:16.520
If there's killer bee honey on the shelf and it's right next to regular honey,

175
00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:21.650
I am that stupid.
I need Kaler Bihar.
And that's why we have it.

176
00:10:21.651 --> 00:10:24.200
So we're selling killer bee honey.
But it is delicious.

177
00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:27.150
15 years ago we've proved our retard to

178
00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:28.990
<v 2>when we,
we,
we,</v>

179
00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:31.900
we had no intention of fighting our dogs cause we wouldn't do that with our

180
00:10:31.901 --> 00:10:33.670
pitfalls.
But I had to go,
I had,

181
00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:38.700
I had to go find a pure breed game bread from a long line of gain bred dogs

182
00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:40.450
pitfall.
Why?

183
00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:43.840
Cause it just had to have it cause it's a fighting dog in case a dog breaks into

184
00:10:43.841 --> 00:10:47.110
my house.
It'll fucking take that dog out.
And you came with me.

185
00:10:47.111 --> 00:10:49.750
We're driving around and we find this one guy who had an advertisement,

186
00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:53.830
our dogs bread right out of the box.
We were like,
we have to get that

187
00:10:54.050 --> 00:10:58.590
<v 1>idiots.
He had a lady,
it's,
he had a really interesting setup man.
He was so open.</v>

188
00:10:58.591 --> 00:11:00.570
Like that guy could have got arrested like so easily.

189
00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:04.460
He called it going to a dog show.
It was interesting,
you know,
cow.

190
00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:07.110
How open he was about it.
It's like wow.
Like you've,

191
00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:11.790
you're breeding fighting dogs and you're fighting these dogs seven years in
jail.

192
00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.030
Those guys who were involved in that.
It's a,
that's a,
that's a,

193
00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:19.080
that's a cruel fucking way to live.
You know,
that's a weird thing.

194
00:11:19.081 --> 00:11:21.660
Like they engineered an animal that wants to go to war.

195
00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:22.760
<v 2>He told me,
he said,</v>

196
00:11:22.761 --> 00:11:26.690
these dogs live with their life on the edge and it became a chain.
And I said,

197
00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.510
when she,
when Bam,
Bam was a year old,

198
00:11:29.511 --> 00:11:32.360
he tried to fight a female and I called him up and I go,

199
00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.260
the dogs trying to fight females.
He goes,
yeah,
that'll happen.
I go,
well,

200
00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:40.490
well how do you get an to me?
He goes,
ah man.
For me,
I gotta,
I gotta wipe the dog.

201
00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:45.510
I've got to wipe the dogs coach and then put it on my mails nose and then lead

202
00:11:46.041 --> 00:11:49.580
him up to it.
Even with a muzzle,
I was like,
fucking,
I don't want,

203
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:52.110
I don't want her to talk like this.
It's a stupid,

204
00:11:52.130 --> 00:11:54.340
and then of course the dog killed a cow

205
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.040
<v 1>and fucking two wasn't a good dog.
And by the way,</v>

206
00:11:57.041 --> 00:12:00.670
we don't sell that dog@ana.com I kept that talk.
Can I get,

207
00:12:00.671 --> 00:12:01.710
you only get cool shit.

208
00:12:01.711 --> 00:12:04.480
You use the code name rogue and save yourself 10% off any and all supplements.

209
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:08.680
Ladies and gentlemen.
Brian counters here.
Yes.
Okay.
That's great.
Yourself,

210
00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:15.120
<v 0>the Joe Rogan experience.
Joe Rogan podcast.</v>

211
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:19.890
So Brian,
Brian Kalyn

212
00:12:19.890 --> 00:12:23.570
<v 1>and I are ready to take it to the next level on the 14th.
Uh,</v>

213
00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:26.260
Steve Rinella returns to the podcast and uh,

214
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:30.870
we'll be discussing future hunting dates.
We're going to do it again.
I'm excited.

215
00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.450
We could have a show,
we could have a show just,
you know,

216
00:12:33.451 --> 00:12:35.670
like it would be the best show in a stupid networks.

217
00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:39.880
You and I hunting like a couple of times a year and it cut it up into,
you know,

218
00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:42.390
like a bunch of different episodes because I mean,

219
00:12:42.391 --> 00:12:44.010
think about how much funny shit would happen.

220
00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:46.970
There would be a lot of people angry at us.
What we're doing though.
Wow.

221
00:12:46.971 --> 00:12:49.280
A lot of people be,
Blake,
you're hunting.

222
00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:53.250
No one ever has ever mixed comedy and hunting,
so they should all come.

223
00:12:53.251 --> 00:12:56.340
No one's ever mixed case fighting and in comedy either.
That's true,

224
00:12:56.910 --> 00:13:00.630
but that's apparently that works.
Yeah.
Yeah.
This works too excited.

225
00:13:00.631 --> 00:13:03.240
So where are we going hunting?
We are going to,
we might most likely Alaska.

226
00:13:03.450 --> 00:13:06.210
Really?
Yeah,
but are we going to hunt hog there?
No.

227
00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:09.870
If we do it between now and August will we'll be going to Alaska.

228
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:13.590
We'll rather um,
we could go and hunt bears,

229
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:17.370
which I didn't want to do for a while until I started watching all these Alaska

230
00:13:17.371 --> 00:13:21.110
shows.
I had a misconception about bears.
First of all,

231
00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.530
I'd misconception about whether or not they're delicious and apparently uh,

232
00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:25.503
black bears are,

233
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:28.950
they taste really good and people love him according to his book,

234
00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.440
depending on what they've been eating.
But yeah,
they're eating blueberries.

235
00:13:31.441 --> 00:13:32.890
It tastes literally like blueberries.
Yeah.

236
00:13:32.891 --> 00:13:34.500
So you want to go with the blueberries are,

237
00:13:34.501 --> 00:13:38.240
and you shoot them in the spring and apparently the delicious.
Yeah,
I just was,

238
00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:39.300
I was not in the,

239
00:13:39.301 --> 00:13:42.320
I'm definitely still not into shooting anything that I'm not going to eat.

240
00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:45.120
I don't want to kill a bear though.
I like Paris.
Why do you like bears?

241
00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:48.120
I don't know.
I just like them best can suck my deck.
I don't like bears at all.

242
00:13:48.150 --> 00:13:51.420
Why?
Because they're assholes.
Bear bears,
don't give a fuck about you.

243
00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:56.510
Bears have blank eyes and they would eat your face if you stood still.
Bears,

244
00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:00.630
bears don't even kill you.
Do you know what bears do?
They just start exceeding.

245
00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:03.870
Yeah.
They just start eating this.
Don't be in their territory.

246
00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:08.850
That's a tricky thing with,
uh,
with omnivores like chimps,
same thing.

247
00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.590
They just start eating well,
chimps,

248
00:14:10.591 --> 00:14:13.290
I talked to the guy at San Diego Zoo and he said,
I said,

249
00:14:13.291 --> 00:14:16.890
you don't have any chances.
He goes,
Nah,
just bonobos.
I said,
well wait a minute.

250
00:14:16.891 --> 00:14:21.750
They have Banabos in captivity where,
and uh,
but I was I think in uh,
um,
yeah,

251
00:14:21.751 --> 00:14:26.460
they do.
And um,
uh,
San Diego Zoo.
Really?
Yup.
And that's interesting.

252
00:14:26.461 --> 00:14:27.790
You share their born almost.
Yeah.
I,

253
00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.360
for some reason I thought that no one has been almost in captivity.

254
00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:34.070
They're amazing.
They're,
they're uh,
their,
um,
because the matriarchal,

255
00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.310
but they fucked so much.
I,

256
00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:38.850
that's why I thought that no one has said that vanilla is,
are really sexual.

257
00:14:38.851 --> 00:14:42.540
And he said,
chimpanzees solve everything with violence.

258
00:14:42.810 --> 00:14:45.300
He said that the first thing you'll see with chimps is they'll have scarred up

259
00:14:45.301 --> 00:14:46.740
risks because the minute they get in a fight,

260
00:14:46.741 --> 00:14:48.750
they cover their genitals cause they go for each other's balls.

261
00:14:48.980 --> 00:14:52.850
So it's so you can't breed said that's why they go for the face and the genitals

262
00:14:52.930 --> 00:14:56.360
and your hands.
They want to scar you up.
They want it.
They want to finish you.

263
00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:57.620
Yeah.
This is one of the,

264
00:14:57.621 --> 00:15:01.510
I guess the San Diego Zoo is one of the first zoos to uh,
to have them.
Yup.

265
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:03.500
I went and saw it there.

266
00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:07.520
Quite possibly the most intelligent primates on earth of than humans and um,

267
00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:09.620
they have,
uh,

268
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:13.100
they have Benobos well that you're going to watch a fuck show if you watch them.

269
00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.390
Cause if you go there,
all they do is fuck.
Yeah.

270
00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:19.310
What's a female dominated society,
you know?
Yeah.
It's a matriarchal society,

271
00:15:19.311 --> 00:15:23.630
but it's also a completely orgiastic like everybody fucks everybody except the

272
00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:27.350
mother doesn't fuck the son.
That's the only the family online they draw.

273
00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.740
Yeah.
If your mom's hot,
you're,
you're out of luck.

274
00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.990
But I guess you could just fuck everybody else.

275
00:15:33.230 --> 00:15:34.670
The good news is you can fuck your dad.

276
00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.620
So couldn't use everybody knows everybody.
Imagine father's day,

277
00:15:39.621 --> 00:15:43.010
how horrible that would be.
Bears are beautiful to look at and everything.

278
00:15:43.011 --> 00:15:47.420
And don't get me wrong,
I mean I think they're beautiful but bears are ruthless,

279
00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:52.270
heartless,
emotionless monsters.
That's what they are.
And for the moment,

280
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:55.730
for that matter,
for the most part,
they're not attacking you.

281
00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:57.980
So our opinion of him is based on that.

282
00:15:58.250 --> 00:16:03.050
But the reality is they can attack you and when they attack you they might as

283
00:16:03.051 --> 00:16:04.340
well be a fucking werewolf.

284
00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:08.630
It might as well be some Munster from the movie that doesn't exist because it's

285
00:16:08.631 --> 00:16:09.710
just as terrifying.

286
00:16:09.770 --> 00:16:13.490
Well since you said that we were going to go hunting in Alaska in August,

287
00:16:13.850 --> 00:16:18.850
I think like 20% of my brain every single day and that's large percentage is

288
00:16:20.121 --> 00:16:24.470
constantly occupied with the hybrid possibilities of,

289
00:16:24.471 --> 00:16:27.410
of a polar bear slash grizzly bear.
Thank you.

290
00:16:27.411 --> 00:16:29.510
Global warming coming into our camp.

291
00:16:29.630 --> 00:16:32.660
Cause remember polar bear will stock and hunt you your meat.

292
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:36.380
And so I'll be sleeping in your tent.
Just so you know,
and I'll be,

293
00:16:36.381 --> 00:16:37.550
I'll be sleeping with a handgun.

294
00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:41.210
Polar bears are the only barriers that are completely carnivorous.

295
00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:44.570
There's no vegetable matter where they live.
There's no fruits,

296
00:16:44.571 --> 00:16:45.590
there's no anything,
and they don't.

297
00:16:45.591 --> 00:16:47.480
So their bodies are not designed to process that.

298
00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:51.140
And then also the only mammals that hunts people actively,

299
00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:54.530
automatically right from birth.
Right.
They see people and they're like,

300
00:16:54.531 --> 00:16:57.410
oh wait that.
Whatever's moving.
They're like,
oh,
eat that.
Well they,
they,

301
00:16:57.430 --> 00:17:01.310
they had this,
they had this baby polar bear.
It was a small,
like an,

302
00:17:01.311 --> 00:17:03.710
it became like,
you know,
it was probably three months,
five months,
whatever.

303
00:17:04.010 --> 00:17:06.740
They couldn't put that into a cage with the other polar bears.

304
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:08.870
Not in a million years.
They would eat it.
They would eat it right away.

305
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:13.560
Right away.
Anyway,
cannibals,
they live in the most ferocious environment.

306
00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:17.240
Grizzlies are cannibals to grizzlies killed her pups all the time when shit goes

307
00:17:17.241 --> 00:17:18.920
bad when they're running out.
Oh really?
Yeah.

308
00:17:18.921 --> 00:17:22.880
They kill their cubs and they eat them.
Yeah.
They eat their own babies.

309
00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:27.440
They can suck it.
Okay.
I'll shoot them right in their stinky heart.
And not me.

310
00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:30.530
I like Paris.
No,
no,
no,
no.

311
00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:35.150
I was trying to kill you.
Yeah.
That's different.
Yeah,
you would have,

312
00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:39.230
I'll have my guns at the ready team people bitch.
Okay.
I'm not saying she's gone.

313
00:17:39.270 --> 00:17:42.230
She Chrisleys I don't want to shoot grizzlies cause apparently grizzlies he

314
00:17:42.231 --> 00:17:45.380
can't eat.
They don't taste good.
I guess it's because of their,

315
00:17:45.410 --> 00:17:47.160
they're such predators.
Yeah.

316
00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:50.010
Which is weird because mountain lions are 100% carnivorous

317
00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:53.490
<v 3>and you can eat them and apparently they're quite tasty actually according to</v>

318
00:17:53.491 --> 00:17:55.440
Steve Byrne Ellis book,
they,
they are,

319
00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:58.580
you got to cook them for a long time and yeah,

320
00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.760
it's a real catch crap shoot a lot of times and not tasty.
Oh really?

321
00:18:01.770 --> 00:18:05.820
And you eat and sometimes people in eating a Grizzly,
uh,
or,
or,
or uh,
with,

322
00:18:05.821 --> 00:18:08.940
they've been eating fish.
It's going to taste like fish.
It's going to be like,

323
00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:12.240
yeah,
but I like fish.
Well yeah,
but apparently it's not a good tasting fish.

324
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:15.390
The other thing about,
the other thing about bear that he talks about his book,

325
00:18:15.391 --> 00:18:16.710
cause you have to,
you have to cook it really,

326
00:18:16.711 --> 00:18:19.740
really well cause you'll get trick and osis and other things because yes,

327
00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:24.080
because they eat rotting meat.
They come across,
you know the Caribou though.

328
00:18:24.450 --> 00:18:26.830
So the same with hogs.
Yeah.

329
00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:29.310
Which is actually one of the reasons you don't eat carnivores.

330
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:31.890
They always say that you're not supposed to eat carnivores because of that.

331
00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:36.700
They carry a bit odd because you eat fish and fish are 100%.
Carter was,
yeah,

332
00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:40.430
most sex means,
I guess a few of them.
He'd vegetables those little pussies.

333
00:18:40.830 --> 00:18:43.520
It's the exception.
Yeah.
It's interesting isn't it?
I mean,
look,

334
00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:46.280
think about lobster.
Lobster.
They eat nothing but rotten meat,

335
00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:50.010
the bottom of the ocean.
And they're delicious.
The best tasting thing ever.

336
00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:54.180
A lobster.
And I think shrimp are related to Lyse and other insects.

337
00:18:54.210 --> 00:18:56.250
They're related,
the roaches.
And when I read that,
I was like,

338
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:59.970
oh we found out that were related to roaches on fear factor when it guy had an

339
00:18:59.971 --> 00:19:04.900
allergic reaction.
Who's eaten?
Roaches was allergic to shellfish.
Whoa.

340
00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:08.400
Same thing.
Same enzymes apparently.
Yeah.
Well you look at it,

341
00:19:08.401 --> 00:19:12.330
I mean it's real fucking similar.
You know crab is like a fixed shelled bug.
Yeah,

342
00:19:12.690 --> 00:19:17.520
exactly.
The same fucking thing seems a spider.
Apparently.
Spiders tastes good.

343
00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:22.380
Really big.
Fat Tarantulas.
Very crab.
Like really you?
Yeah.
If you cook them right?

344
00:19:22.410 --> 00:19:24.690
Yeah.
What about all the spines?
I don't know.

345
00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:26.890
I guess you burned them all gets you burned them off.
Yeah.

346
00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:30.390
Since those fuckers off because I'm trenchless they have those little weird

347
00:19:30.391 --> 00:19:32.920
microscopic little fibers that dig into your score.

348
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:35.550
One of the things I took from that trip being out there in the middle of the

349
00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:40.730
Atlantis is how fucked you would be if you had to go hunt first of all,

350
00:19:42.301 --> 00:19:43.051
girl by herself.

351
00:19:43.051 --> 00:19:46.020
Cause you'd freeze to death and I don't give a shit what anybody says.
Secondly,

352
00:19:46.021 --> 00:19:47.670
if you had to go hunt your own food,

353
00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:52.110
you'd be out there cold and hungry as shit without it,
without a prayer.

354
00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:54.530
It's a hard man.
And even,

355
00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:59.600
I mean the bat like what we were at was at one point in time a notion and it was

356
00:20:02.371 --> 00:20:06.390
like really clay.
Yeah.
There wasn't a lot of like vegetable matter,

357
00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:11.570
so it was really weird the way you were walking around with these gigantic empty

358
00:20:11.941 --> 00:20:16.290
hills all over the place and you'd get to the top of one and it gets really

359
00:20:16.291 --> 00:20:18.090
freaky when you get to the top of them.

360
00:20:18.091 --> 00:20:22.710
And then you look out at how big this area where there's no people is.
Yeah.

361
00:20:23.130 --> 00:20:26.430
I mean it's unbelievable.
Vast fuck.

362
00:20:26.580 --> 00:20:31.020
And you can fall and you can fall.
And by the way,
there a cactus is everywhere.

363
00:20:31.021 --> 00:20:32.850
So just,
just at the very minimal,

364
00:20:32.851 --> 00:20:36.600
you're going to be dealing with a pain in the ass.
Yeah.
It's so harsh.

365
00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:40.650
And that's why when,
when Brian and I were there,
the uh,

366
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:45.090
Steven Noah explained to us that this is where Lewis and Clark had gone.

367
00:20:45.091 --> 00:20:48.160
We actually camp and the same campground our first night where Lewis

368
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.280
<v 1>and Clark at stayed.
Yep.
And um,</v>

369
00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:53.290
a bunch of people tried to live out there.

370
00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:56.590
They tried to with the what's called homesteading and they give you a piece of

371
00:20:56.591 --> 00:20:59.010
land and if you can farm it for like a couple of years or whatever,

372
00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:00.790
I had to grow like dry weight,
I think it's called.

373
00:21:00.791 --> 00:21:04.750
And they just couldn't even do that shit.
It's mud.
Yeah.
Everything is just gooey.

374
00:21:04.751 --> 00:21:07.980
Bottom of a lake mud.
Just hating life.
Yeah.

375
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.530
It was like the Great Western inland sea,
I think it was called.

376
00:21:11.531 --> 00:21:15.490
And there used to be dinosaurs there and it's a really freaky plus Clark when

377
00:21:15.491 --> 00:21:18.940
they went through that area I read,
didn't see any native Americans.
Yeah.

378
00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:22.830
No black feet or anything because uh,
they just,
they couldn't live there.
Yeah.

379
00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:25.780
Apparently they would visit it every now and then a hunting trips and then go

380
00:21:25.781 --> 00:21:27.760
back.
But that's it.
And that's,
you know,

381
00:21:27.761 --> 00:21:31.540
when you get into like a sparse sort of a situation like God damn,

382
00:21:31.541 --> 00:21:34.500
we got to go find those fucking crazy deer in the badlands.
Yeah.

383
00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.660
Cause those deer just running around.
There's not that many of them.

384
00:21:37.661 --> 00:21:41.050
And there's the occasional mountain lions running around jacking him.
It's crazy.

385
00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.750
We found mountain lynch shit.
Did you see any of that up there?
No,

386
00:21:44.010 --> 00:21:48.840
it was fat ropes of hair.
That's where like,
like shit with heron it.
Yeah.

387
00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:51.290
You know,
that's when you know something's been jacking people.
Yup.

388
00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:55.120
Or Jack in the deer's rather.
Yup.
Yeah.
It's a harsh place,
man.

389
00:21:55.121 --> 00:21:58.060
If you had to live there,
I'm not really sure you could you,

390
00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.300
I don't think all of us,
the guys that were there and we had the like

391
00:22:02.290 --> 00:22:05.980
<v 2>even even living in like that,
like if you look at the New Guinea,
uh,
that the,</v>

392
00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:07.210
the like in New Guinea,

393
00:22:07.211 --> 00:22:10.030
Papa New Guinea where if people had been living for forever,

394
00:22:10.210 --> 00:22:11.530
they're mostly malnourished,

395
00:22:11.531 --> 00:22:14.860
always were because they had to eat like things like,
um,
uh,

396
00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:19.120
Barc route and things like just stuff that just grows in swamps that has no

397
00:22:19.121 --> 00:22:20.320
nutritional value.

398
00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:25.150
You have to harvest a insects in the air and make mashes of them and roast them.

399
00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:27.620
Socks.
Dude,
I was just like,

400
00:22:27.890 --> 00:22:30.790
this is fucking shittiest life in the world you'd spent all day.

401
00:22:30.850 --> 00:22:34.240
Not only he's spending all day fucking harvesting bugs in fucking bark route.

402
00:22:34.241 --> 00:22:38.250
That's it.
That's delicious.
But then you're most likely to die from um,

403
00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:42.910
inner tribal conflict.
You can only have small tribes.
You know,
you couldn't,

404
00:22:43.150 --> 00:22:45.550
you couldn't support a lot of people on sets this little food.

405
00:22:45.551 --> 00:22:49.120
She had to walk around in small bands of families and then they'd come across

406
00:22:49.121 --> 00:22:51.760
each other and be like,
you're in our territory.
And it'd be a fight.

407
00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:56.700
<v 1>Yes.
Fucking yeah.
The um,
the fly sandwiches.</v>

408
00:22:56.850 --> 00:22:59.730
Yeah.
Fly.
It's fly balls.
Fly Ball eyeballs.

409
00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.550
That is the craziest thing to do with mosquitoes too.
Yeah.

410
00:23:02.551 --> 00:23:06.240
They take a net and they think,
well they use a,
they use a pot,

411
00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:08.100
they take a pot like a metal pot.

412
00:23:08.101 --> 00:23:11.400
They wing it through the mosquitoes over and over again and they stick to the

413
00:23:11.401 --> 00:23:11.761
bottom.

414
00:23:11.761 --> 00:23:15.390
I slam on the bottom and then you like do like this with your hands and make a

415
00:23:15.391 --> 00:23:20.160
cake of it.
And then they fry the cake.
They make mosquito hamburgers.

416
00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:24.720
Have you seen it?
You've seen the video talking about yeah.
It's so disturbed.

417
00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:24.900
Yeah.

418
00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:29.760
It's a ball of carbon bug that that part of the world sucks up fat one.

419
00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:33.420
I,
I'd move lots because that's what it is.

420
00:23:33.421 --> 00:23:36.480
It's like they don't know what the fuck to do,
man.
Sam Sherman and lived

421
00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:40.080
<v 2>with the intuit,
you know,
and he was like,
it's your,
you,
all you do is you eat,</v>

422
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:43.950
you're going to eat meat and see how if you didn't catch a seal that winter,
uh,

423
00:23:43.951 --> 00:23:45.800
you were living in the dark eight months

424
00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:49.010
<v 3>to live with them for,
for like adding a week or something.</v>

425
00:23:49.011 --> 00:23:51.890
He's written this book two weeks,
but he said,
everything's a refrigerator,
right?

426
00:23:51.891 --> 00:23:54.680
So you got the,
he,
he,
he wore these wolf mittens.

427
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:58.240
There's wolf for mittens and you just would leave mount side.
They didn't,

428
00:23:58.241 --> 00:24:01.220
weren't cured.
You just leave them outside.
So when you actually skin an animal,

429
00:24:01.490 --> 00:24:04.340
you can actually wear the fur without curing it or worrying about it.

430
00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.940
But like you're always the,
he said,
well,

431
00:24:07.941 --> 00:24:10.610
you guys really a master fisherman and stuff and the woman goes,

432
00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:14.570
we used to freeze and we used to starve to death all the time.

433
00:24:15.770 --> 00:24:18.500
We would end up and end up trying to kill our dogs to eat.

434
00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:20.900
The problem is you couldn't kill too many dogs cause then the bears would come

435
00:24:20.901 --> 00:24:24.320
and kill you.
So you were just always living.
So if you didn't get a seal,

436
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:28.520
one seal that you were done for the winner because you didn't have oil to burn,

437
00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:31.220
so you were living member.
It's dark 24,
seven,

438
00:24:31.221 --> 00:24:33.890
sometimes for four months of the year,
five months,
year,
you're,

439
00:24:33.891 --> 00:24:38.210
you're living in the dark,
eaten raw fish in your Igloo.
Okay.

440
00:24:38.250 --> 00:24:42.200
Oh yeah.
That's what it was like.
Can't see anything.
So you're not going anywhere.

441
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:43.190
Oh,
you have no fire.

442
00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:47.450
You staying in your Igloo and you're hoping you have enough fish.

443
00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:50.870
There's no firewood.
Right.
There's nothing to learn.
Now they would burn,

444
00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:55.010
they would burn a fucking,
uh,
oil.
Yeah.
She's,

445
00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:58.340
how's that rice?
And they would align their regular,
this is with like seal for,

446
00:24:58.341 --> 00:25:02.570
but nothing just keep you warm.
Right.
Nothing.
Just body heat.
Yeah.
And,
and they,

447
00:25:02.571 --> 00:25:07.250
they've anatomically,
uh,
evolved so that their hands and feet don't get cold.

448
00:25:07.340 --> 00:25:10.220
Yeah,
I saw that.
Yeah.
That's freaky man.
Yeah.

449
00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:14.480
It's freaky to realize that that probably only took place over a few thousand

450
00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:18.050
years.
And they all have frostbite on their,
um,
on their faces,
on their cheeks.

451
00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:23.000
All of them.
Yeah.
Whoa.
All frostbitten cheeks.
They just deal with it.
Yeah.

452
00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:27.370
I still got a scar.
Scar tissue scar all over your face.
Yeah,
he,

453
00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:30.290
they would get around on smushed sleds.
They still do.

454
00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:33.900
And then now that you snowmobiles,
but he was like,
you know,
you're on,

455
00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:38.450
you're on a fucking your dogs and only w I think it's only one species dog,

456
00:25:38.451 --> 00:25:42.650
not huskies.
There are type of Husky,
the only one dog about 45,
50 pounds.

457
00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:46.220
Those the only dogs that can survive that,
that can live in that,
that,
that cold.

458
00:25:46.670 --> 00:25:49.250
Yeah.
What a shit way to live.

459
00:25:49.251 --> 00:25:52.040
But what an amazing thing that people are willing to try it.

460
00:25:52.520 --> 00:25:56.820
I think like anything else,
human beings get used to anything.

461
00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:01.130
Anything you,
when you're in jail forever,
you get used to,
you figure it out.

462
00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:04.700
And when you want,
rich people are fucked.
They get used to being rich.

463
00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:09.080
That's right.
So you're used to being a lazy,
like kids born rich.

464
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:13.190
It fucks him up.
But it's called the wealth of cap,
handicap of wealth.

465
00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:15.590
Do you worry about that with your son?

466
00:26:15.591 --> 00:26:20.110
Do you think like that and make sure this little motherfucker like,
yeah.
Yes.

467
00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:24.050
Develops and discipline.
I was going to say one of the ways out is sports.
Yeah.

468
00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:28.250
And learning how to lose properly and then he had a win and you know,

469
00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:30.290
that's a very huge,
it's huge.

470
00:26:30.291 --> 00:26:33.080
Sports are teach you how tough or you're not and how to lose,

471
00:26:33.230 --> 00:26:36.800
not just how to win and mainly teach you how to do things like recognize

472
00:26:36.801 --> 00:26:39.380
plateaus.
You know,
people always,

473
00:26:39.410 --> 00:26:42.530
that's why I always tell young people I go look accomplishment.

474
00:26:42.590 --> 00:26:44.370
When you're to accomplish something,

475
00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:47.880
all you have to do in some ways is have a good teacher so you're practicing

476
00:26:47.881 --> 00:26:52.140
correctly and show up every day and you're going to find long time periods of

477
00:26:52.141 --> 00:26:54.420
time where you just hit plateaus.
Where you know,

478
00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:57.720
I tried to write today and I just,
I was like,
my head was all over the place.

479
00:26:57.721 --> 00:27:01.890
Why it doesn't matter.
The point is,
I tried to write,
you just show up every day,

480
00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.780
you know,
take,
you can take your breaks of course.
But you know,

481
00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:09.800
for the most part you've got to kind of like familiarize yourself with the,

482
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:15.110
the peaks,
valleys and plateaus of accomplishment you run.

483
00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:19.020
One of the things about sports is that the competitions are clearly defined

484
00:27:19.170 --> 00:27:19.410
there.

485
00:27:19.410 --> 00:27:22.710
They're very obvious if have you been successful at getting the ball into the

486
00:27:22.711 --> 00:27:27.530
hole?
No.
If not,
why have you been successful at Po,
you know,

487
00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:29.690
wrestling people if not,
why?
Yeah.
You know,

488
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:34.990
and you either adjust and work accordingly and use your intelligence to sort of

489
00:27:35.551 --> 00:27:36.990
figure out whatever puzzle it is,

490
00:27:36.991 --> 00:27:40.710
whatever game you're playing and whatever the parameters are or you don't.

491
00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.680
It's that simple.
Whereas like socially,

492
00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:47.150
there's a lot of bullshit and there's a lot of gray area and you know,

493
00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.590
you might think you're cool because you listen to the right records and you

494
00:27:49.591 --> 00:27:51.780
dress the right way and you live in the right neighborhood,

495
00:27:51.990 --> 00:27:54.540
but really not really.
Not really.

496
00:27:54.541 --> 00:27:57.260
You don't have any character because you've never had,
it was about the sat.

497
00:27:57.261 --> 00:27:59.000
It was about to say that,
you know,
I,

498
00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:02.490
if I was just thinking about it as she was saying that I think socially,

499
00:28:02.850 --> 00:28:05.040
whether or not you're most entertaining person or not,

500
00:28:05.110 --> 00:28:06.720
I really think that a huge,

501
00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:11.580
huge way to fix a social issue you may have.
It's just be honest,

502
00:28:11.970 --> 00:28:14.970
like you and I always talk about like,
just,
just don't lie man.

503
00:28:14.971 --> 00:28:17.310
Don't lie to your friends.
Just be really honest about it.

504
00:28:17.311 --> 00:28:20.370
If you haven't problems,
if you have like an issue,
whatever it is,

505
00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:24.270
if you're open and upfront about it and don't take yourself too seriously,

506
00:28:24.271 --> 00:28:28.050
if you can do that,
it's very high as a lot of personal assessment.
Well,

507
00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:32.010
this just,
it goes back to sports or any thoughts on it?
Especially martial arts.

508
00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:34.980
I've always said the best way to stop bullying is a teach.
Everyone had a fight.

509
00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:38.870
Yeah,
and you know why?
Because the big guys won't be bullying if third,

510
00:28:38.871 --> 00:28:41.160
they're actually training and learning how to fight.
I don't know.

511
00:28:41.161 --> 00:28:43.110
Good fighters that are bullies.
It's much,

512
00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:48.000
much more rare than regular big people who aren't bullies.
That's right.

513
00:28:48.060 --> 00:28:50.190
Regular big.
There's a lot of bullies,

514
00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:53.970
especially if they're like insecure and that's the only thing that they have.

515
00:28:54.330 --> 00:28:57.150
It's like a girl whose personality sucks,
which has got big tits.

516
00:28:57.151 --> 00:28:58.800
We're gonna see those tits everywhere she goes.

517
00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:02.100
She's going to make sure she knows where,
you know,
where her asset lies,

518
00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:05.520
personal assessment and due to become bullies.
It's like,
what do you think?

519
00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:07.320
That's it.
You just brought up something that's interesting to me,

520
00:29:07.321 --> 00:29:10.680
like about the way to teach,
stop bullying.
See terribly.

521
00:29:10.681 --> 00:29:13.530
If I wish I couldn't agree more with it's true,
what would you do?

522
00:29:13.531 --> 00:29:15.630
So what would you do about this?
This,

523
00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:19.920
this gun issue that's a much more complicated issue than just bullying.

524
00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:23.820
But I think it could solve the,
I really do believe,
cause you said,

525
00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:27.780
what does it mean,
uh,
this do,
do,
do,
do you have armed guards?
I mean,

526
00:29:27.781 --> 00:29:30.870
is that how you stop it?
What do you,
there's a bunch.

527
00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:33.110
There's a bunch of issues with,
um,
the,

528
00:29:33.111 --> 00:29:36.360
the school shooting thing with many mass shooting,
any,

529
00:29:36.361 --> 00:29:38.400
there's a ton of issues involved here.

530
00:29:38.850 --> 00:29:43.850
And not in the least of them is the mental state of human beings today.

531
00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:49.840
Take medication aside.
You know,
put,
put it,
put it as a variable.

532
00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:51.650
I know a lot of people resist that variable,

533
00:29:51.651 --> 00:29:55.450
especially people who are proponents of a antidepressants,

534
00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:59.080
especially people who have enjoyed the effects of antidepressants.

535
00:29:59.080 --> 00:29:59.651
Cause apparently,

536
00:29:59.651 --> 00:30:02.860
and Chi antidepressants can make a lot of people happy and I'm not disputing

537
00:30:02.861 --> 00:30:05.070
that.
But there's,
um,

538
00:30:05.140 --> 00:30:09.700
there's something going on with the state of mind of a human being who's willing

539
00:30:09.701 --> 00:30:14.530
to do something unbelievably horrific to affect a large group of people.

540
00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:18.760
That is the,
it's gotta be the result of that sort of mass scale destruction.

541
00:30:18.910 --> 00:30:22.060
It's like you want to affect people in the most horrific way.

542
00:30:22.061 --> 00:30:24.550
This guy was shot children.
He wanted affect people in the most,

543
00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:29.050
most horrific way.
Why we have to get to the root of that.

544
00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:33.040
What makes a person do that?
You can't do that.
Okay.
You would never do that.

545
00:30:33.180 --> 00:30:36.850
I know.
Hold on.
Sorry.
I know you,
you would never be a school shooting.

546
00:30:36.970 --> 00:30:40.870
You'd never shoot babies.
So who would shoot babies and why?

547
00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:45.990
What the fuck makes a person like that and that's not the gun issue and that's

548
00:30:46.661 --> 00:30:50.170
not a fertilizer bomb issue and it's not a nuclear issue.

549
00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:51.790
It's an issue of humanity.

550
00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:57.030
What is it about us where we have failed as a culture so much that even we have

551
00:30:58.781 --> 00:31:00.970
one example out of a million like that.

552
00:31:00.971 --> 00:31:04.690
How does that happen in a community of people who can read,

553
00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:06.430
who are aware of each other's presence?

554
00:31:06.431 --> 00:31:10.510
How can you get to a point where you got a guy like that who's willing and able

555
00:31:10.511 --> 00:31:13.000
to do something like that question.
Then from that is I,

556
00:31:13.010 --> 00:31:15.010
I think I've always been what you,

557
00:31:15.011 --> 00:31:17.770
what you just described a lot of times the one in the closet,

558
00:31:17.771 --> 00:31:20.050
definitely one of the classic definitions of the Sociopath,

559
00:31:20.051 --> 00:31:21.910
a psychotic sociopath is they,

560
00:31:21.911 --> 00:31:26.290
they will do something horrific to watch the effect.
That's how they get power.

561
00:31:26.291 --> 00:31:29.380
That's how they get pleasure and there are a lot of different examples of that

562
00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:30.580
and so psychologist,

563
00:31:30.581 --> 00:31:34.000
I read a book called the sociopath next door where she talks exactly about that

564
00:31:34.220 --> 00:31:38.020
though.
The other issue might be if we agree that we've always had,

565
00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:41.260
we're always gonna have sociopath's it's an aberration in the gene pool,

566
00:31:41.261 --> 00:31:44.890
a culture or whatever like that.
The Guy,
whatever the guy from Columbine,

567
00:31:44.891 --> 00:31:46.160
one kid was suicidal,
the other guy,

568
00:31:46.161 --> 00:31:50.080
a kid had a history of being sadistic sociopath or another style of it.

569
00:31:50.081 --> 00:31:54.910
Bernie Madoff.
Different sacks.
Exactly.
The question becomes,
I guess,

570
00:31:55.270 --> 00:31:59.710
is there a discussion to be had about how to keep these lethal weapons out of

571
00:31:59.711 --> 00:32:04.390
those kinds of people's hands?
It's a,
if it's a public health issue,
you know,
um,

572
00:32:04.780 --> 00:32:08.500
and we can figure out a way to get these people at least monitored or helped in

573
00:32:08.501 --> 00:32:13.450
some way or not or locked up if there's no shabbats.
It seems to me that,
that,

574
00:32:13.510 --> 00:32:18.250
that the variable is the availability of lethal guns.

575
00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:22.660
Now I own guns so I'm not,
I don't really know how to address,
I don't know.

576
00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:24.030
I don't know.
The Pr,
I don't know how to address.

577
00:32:24.090 --> 00:32:28.870
Very interesting point and I think you'd be silly if you didn't agree with that.

578
00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:33.520
The issue is though that the national rifle association and gun enthusiasts in

579
00:32:33.521 --> 00:32:38.521
general are not willing to give any ground whatsoever and they don't want it any

580
00:32:38.621 --> 00:32:40.430
more because want to be able to own these guns,

581
00:32:40.431 --> 00:32:43.310
they want to be able to go out and buy.
Like my friend Anthony Kumina,

582
00:32:43.370 --> 00:32:45.580
he has a 50 caliber gun.
It's like,

583
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:49.520
it's like I can shoot a hole through a fucking building.

584
00:32:49.550 --> 00:32:51.230
It's in fact against the Geneva Conventions.

585
00:32:51.231 --> 00:32:54.590
I believe you can look it up and you can't use it against personnel because

586
00:32:54.591 --> 00:32:58.130
you've come apart while he has one of those.
And why does he have one of those?

587
00:32:58.131 --> 00:32:59.930
Cause he's crazy.
He wants to own it.

588
00:32:59.931 --> 00:33:02.500
But I'm not worried about him shooting up anybody.
He's,

589
00:33:02.501 --> 00:33:05.990
he's just a gun enthusiast and their,
uh,

590
00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:08.990
their thoughts are they should be able to be a gun enthusiast.

591
00:33:08.991 --> 00:33:12.470
And I agree with that.
I agree with that as well.
If you are a,

592
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:17.600
I'm a law abiding citizen who follows rules and regulations and you know,

593
00:33:17.601 --> 00:33:19.850
you're not an insane person.
You're not a sociopath.

594
00:33:19.851 --> 00:33:23.990
And Anthony's a perfect example of,
he's not none of those.
It's not a bad guy.

595
00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:25.930
He just wants to be able to have that gun.
And the,

596
00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:29.010
I feel that he should be able to do that.
I really do.
I mean,

597
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:31.070
it's crazy as it sounds.
Well,
I mean,

598
00:33:31.071 --> 00:33:36.071
I own guns and I don't want somebody taking my guns how much horsepower my car

599
00:33:36.201 --> 00:33:38.960
can.
I don't want someone telling me how warm my house can be.

600
00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:42.620
I don't want someone telling me,
you know,
how much fuel you using.
I don't want,

601
00:33:42.650 --> 00:33:44.000
I don't want that.
I don't,

602
00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:48.560
I don't believe that you should be allowed to control very much about other

603
00:33:48.561 --> 00:33:51.230
people's lives when it's not affecting you.
Right.
And you know,

604
00:33:51.231 --> 00:33:54.800
there's all the arguments about the use of fossil fuels and using your share and

605
00:33:54.801 --> 00:33:57.320
all that.
There's,
that is not the way to handle that.

606
00:33:57.321 --> 00:33:59.870
By stopping people from using this technology.

607
00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:02.030
We've already developed a technology.

608
00:34:02.031 --> 00:34:05.870
We're going to have cars that run microcar runs the runs on 50 50 miles before

609
00:34:05.871 --> 00:34:08.480
it needed to gallons.
You have a golf cart,
you don't have a car.

610
00:34:09.230 --> 00:34:13.430
It's a dishwashing liquid.
Manly about bugs you doesn't terrifying.

611
00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:17.770
He hates my prayers so much in you that that wants to come out and said it would

612
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:21.710
would come out with a Shelby gt 500 that's what you need to get ahold of.

613
00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:24.500
662 horsepower.
Yeah,

614
00:34:24.501 --> 00:34:27.770
baby would have real v eight six drive the speed limit.

615
00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:32.690
Just again thinking,
Ooh,

616
00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:35.570
you want to feel that I haven't did much fucking seat.

617
00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:40.010
You say that because he never had one.
Trust me,
Jesus Christ son,
trust me.

618
00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:45.320
Trust me,
the shelving and trusted me.
Yes.
Get a fucking American muscle car,
man.

619
00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:50.270
You have to get an automatic.
We'll get a challenger SRT eight beautiful things.

620
00:34:50.271 --> 00:34:51.740
Yeah,
it was a big fucking Hemi in it.

621
00:34:51.741 --> 00:34:55.010
Then make an automatic for pussy like laughs at me.
He's like,
Hey,

622
00:34:55.011 --> 00:34:59.330
if I can tell you he can't believe I drive a Prius car,
you end Fitzsimmons.

623
00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:01.370
Fitzsimmons at least admits it though.

624
00:35:01.371 --> 00:35:05.450
He loves cars guy most of my life I don't think that way,
but just,

625
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:06.710
I'm just so lazy with cars.

626
00:35:06.711 --> 00:35:09.410
I literally got it cause I didn't want to get out of the car as after this.

627
00:35:09.411 --> 00:35:12.200
Let's go to the Ford dealership and go for a little drive.
It's not pushing me,

628
00:35:12.201 --> 00:35:14.540
man.
Come on man.
No peer pressure.
Come on man.

629
00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:17.590
If you want to get something reasonable,
get like an m three or something.

630
00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:21.900
Get something that's got some packet pickup.
Shut his mouth.

631
00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:26.120
You were going to get an Audi.
What happened with that?
I just found a cramped.

632
00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:29.880
If found it cramped,
crampy a five.
I was like driving in a lunchbox.

633
00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:31.870
I liked the feeling of the my,
my,
my,

634
00:35:32.090 --> 00:35:37.090
my Prius was like half as much as money and cheap and I n I only had to get out

635
00:35:38.551 --> 00:35:40.800
of the car.
Do you have to get out of the car three times more with an Audi?

636
00:35:40.801 --> 00:35:42.420
I was like,
I'll just drive this.
It's easier.

637
00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:46.600
<v 1>So lazy when we got to get you doing more podcasts so you sell more comedy</v>

638
00:35:46.601 --> 00:35:50.770
tickets so you feel comfortable getting a real fucking car.
Speaking of which,

639
00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:55.940
I'll be in San Francisco at the punchline.
January,
2016,
17,
18th,
19th.

640
00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:59.860
Come get some free club.
That's why one of the great clubs in the country,

641
00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:00.933
without a doubt,

642
00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:05.050
the punchline at San Francisco is one of the tonic sites on earth.
We're Friday,

643
00:36:05.051 --> 00:36:08.770
we're,
um,
tonight we're actually,
we're at the ice house.
Oh,
can I do a quick,
uh,

644
00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:11.410
I'll go ahead.
I'm sorry.
Go ahead.
I just wanted to do a quick promo.
Thanks.

645
00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:16.490
A iTunes for rating 10 minute podcast and the top three comedies of 2012.

646
00:36:17.530 --> 00:36:19.690
It was really pumped and my leg Tourette's or something.

647
00:36:19.691 --> 00:36:22.000
Why would you say that in the middle of someone's health saying something else

648
00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:25.390
outside of that side.
I was saying,
I was asking me if I could promote with you,

649
00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:27.310
but why would you do that?
Why would you do that?

650
00:36:27.311 --> 00:36:29.800
When we're talking about the exact day of the show,

651
00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:31.540
we're saying we've got a show tonight.

652
00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:36.560
<v 3>Can I just stop you?
I'm sorry.
I'll stop you right now and talk about my,
sorry.</v>

653
00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:37.680
That's a ridiculous thing to,

654
00:36:37.690 --> 00:36:41.020
so I thought you was going to say something related that you had to get out.
No,

655
00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:44.120
I was completely just turned it on yourself.
Sorry.

656
00:36:44.121 --> 00:36:48.360
I was no reason to piggy back on.
I'm talking,
we have a show tonight.

657
00:36:48.361 --> 00:36:51.750
You fuck show at the,
at the Ice House Comedy Club

658
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:56.590
<v 1>in the small room.
It's Brian Red Ban,
not Brian Cowen.
Um,
uh,</v>

659
00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:58.240
Sam note.

660
00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:00.840
<v 3>Tripoli's.
Yeah,
it's incredibly cheap.</v>

661
00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:05.080
<v 1>Uh,
Kevin Christie,
great.
All very cool people.</v>

662
00:37:05.081 --> 00:37:09.430
And it's like the most intimate room in La.
It's in Pasadena actually,

663
00:37:09.431 --> 00:37:12.620
so set even in la,
but it's five minutes of that room.
That's it.

664
00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:14.920
The little room only seats like 80 people.

665
00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:19.880
It's a good place to fuck around and work out.
And so,
uh,
it's,

666
00:37:19.881 --> 00:37:23.200
it's like one of the most fun places to come.
So it's tonight at 10 o'clock.

667
00:37:23.290 --> 00:37:27.670
How much?
Uh,
15 bucks.
15 bucks.
And it's the Ice House,
the Ice House,

668
00:37:27.671 --> 00:37:31.630
which is like the greatest fucking club in the history of the San Fernando

669
00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:32.980
Valley,
but it's not even in the San Fernando Valley.

670
00:37:32.981 --> 00:37:37.810
It's in a different valley is actually,
what is it?
Bourbon?
No,
I don't think so.

671
00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:41.800
Pasadena is not the San Fernando.
What is that?
Whatever it is.

672
00:37:42.010 --> 00:37:45.730
It's right near Alta Dena figured out bitch.
It's on the way to big bear,

673
00:37:46.340 --> 00:37:50.140
but that's tonight at 10:00 PM so a go home,
wash your pussy,

674
00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:51.250
put on your favorite tee shirt.

675
00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:54.120
<v 4>It's a cold room because we all just kind of pretty much fuck around with new</v>

676
00:37:54.121 --> 00:37:57.780
material,
so it's not like a regular show where it's usually like sets.

677
00:37:57.781 --> 00:38:00.270
It's a lot of fucking around so it's fun.
It's cool to watch.

678
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:02.900
<v 1>Sorry to interrupt.
No,
I'm just fucking around this guy.</v>

679
00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:05.720
I love people and this guy just sent me a message.
Move on.

680
00:38:05.721 --> 00:38:07.130
You're being a bitch to Brian Cowen.

681
00:38:07.770 --> 00:38:12.760
<v 3>Hey,
fuck you.
White Horse Captain White Night.
Thank you.</v>

682
00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:17.320
White horse.
I want to say your name,
dummy account.
It was so gross,
man.

683
00:38:17.321 --> 00:38:19.950
They can't even take people fucking with you.
Go to stu who could

684
00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:25.290
or go to say monitoring.
I'm going to talk now.

685
00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:30.280
Neutral top when you're doing your jumping on each job.
I finally watched.

686
00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:30.520
Hang

687
00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:33.500
<v 4>over to that was your role in that was really good.
Did you wait?</v>

688
00:38:33.501 --> 00:38:36.190
So are you in hangover three also?
I was offered a part in the hangover

689
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:38.920
<v 2>three and I was doing a movie called ride along,
so I couldn't do it.</v>

690
00:38:38.921 --> 00:38:41.680
Let's be honest.
Hangover too.
As a fucking terrible movie.
It was really,

691
00:38:41.681 --> 00:38:45.190
really bad.
I didn't do the whole thing.
I watched,
I paid for it.

692
00:38:45.191 --> 00:38:47.880
I watched the whole thing and I'll say this,

693
00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:51.220
this movie a ride along I did with Kevin Hart.
That guy's the funniest.

694
00:38:51.221 --> 00:38:55.720
He kills me.
He fucking kills me.
I'm trying to do a scene with him.

695
00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:58.660
Every single time he do something,
he'd do something that made me laugh.

696
00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:02.230
He just does shit out of nowhere where you're just like this guy.
He's,

697
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:05.670
he's going to be something man.
He's already,
he's already,
he's,

698
00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:09.080
and he's such a fucking good guy.
Do you know him?
Oh,

699
00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:12.580
he's such a fucking good human being.
That's awesome.
Like he's just a,

700
00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:16.510
Kevin Hart is a classic example of,
he's just a great human being,
man.

701
00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:20.050
It's like the kind of person you are so happiest successful because he's such a

702
00:39:20.051 --> 00:39:23.980
fucking great guy.
I,
I'm,
I'm being very traumatic.
But I really mean,

703
00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:29.080
were you there during the taping at the same time that Brody got some kind of

704
00:39:29.081 --> 00:39:30.910
like blow job from a man girl?

705
00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:34.660
Well that never happened but I was there and I was telling them never happened.

706
00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:37.810
I don't think so cause I was there.
And what it talks about,
he's a wine.

707
00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:39.790
Oh maybe it wasn't when I was there,

708
00:39:39.791 --> 00:39:42.700
but we were at the lady boy thing and I said to him,
I said,
Brody,

709
00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:45.250
if you take that girl home,
even though it's a guy,

710
00:39:45.251 --> 00:39:48.040
it does not make you gay because that's the best looking chick up ever.

711
00:39:48.041 --> 00:39:50.950
So did he or didn't he?
He says he did.
Oh,
I don't mean he got,

712
00:39:50.951 --> 00:39:52.810
he gets really emotional about it.
I Dunno.

713
00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:57.880
<v 1>You just weren't there with him the whole time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.</v>

714
00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:02.760
Are you saying all right,
wow.
Brody might be full shit.
Brody might be crazy.
No,

715
00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:06.960
no,
I that's not something you'd want to lie about.
Yeah,
there's a good story.

716
00:40:07.350 --> 00:40:09.390
If you suck,
I need a new 10 minutes.
And I wasn't,

717
00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:11.970
I wasn't with them the whole time.
Just talking about deep sucking my Dick.

718
00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:15.220
So a lot of dudes with stories about dude suck in their decks.

719
00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:19.670
I think about Stan hope had a nice one.
That was a nice story about who else?

720
00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:23.940
Like the fourth or noon of showing your Dick at a comedy club.

721
00:40:23.941 --> 00:40:25.980
You know how like guys all show their dicks at the comedy clubs.

722
00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:28.350
I think that's the next stage.
People don't know that,

723
00:40:28.351 --> 00:40:32.730
but it's not all comedy clubs.
It's just the store.
Is that,
yeah.

724
00:40:32.731 --> 00:40:35.820
I've never seen anybody's dick anywhere else.
Oh,
at the funny bone.
I saw a few,

725
00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:40.020
few,
few Willie's in Columbia.
And think how gross that is.

726
00:40:40.021 --> 00:40:44.240
You're at the funny button
in his mouth.
Exactly.

727
00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:49.470
Um,
no.
In the comedy store,
I saw everybody pull their dick out,

728
00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:52.500
but our,
he got in trouble for pulling his dick out in Hbo.

729
00:40:52.830 --> 00:40:54.330
Like you can't just pull your dick out place.

730
00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:56.780
People get really upset about that exposure yet.

731
00:40:56.810 --> 00:40:59.190
But are you had a really funny bit where he pulled his dick out at the end,

732
00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:02.370
dropped his pants and pulled his cock out.
Jim Norton's really funny.

733
00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:05.190
He was for Jim Door Norton show.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But uh,

734
00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:07.310
apparently he didn't tell them and he was going to do it this way.

735
00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:10.340
I would say holding as he got a piece on him.
He's got giant balls.

736
00:41:11.520 --> 00:41:15.000
It's Dixon normal.
I mean it would probably be impressive as balls were tiny.

737
00:41:15.180 --> 00:41:17.940
If his balls were like little marbles,
he'd be like just the size of his cock.

738
00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:22.050
His balls are preposterous.
Look,
Star Wars,

739
00:41:22.051 --> 00:41:27.051
he somewhere in his family must have been a whole herd of sluts because uh,

740
00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:28.530
the amount,

741
00:41:28.531 --> 00:41:33.531
the size of a human's balls apparently are directly proportionate to the amount

742
00:41:34.641 --> 00:41:39.530
of promiscuous females in,
in your,
in your area.
Wow.
Yeah.

743
00:41:39.531 --> 00:41:42.650
That's why a humans and chimps have such giant nuts.

744
00:41:42.770 --> 00:41:46.730
But gorillas have little tiny ones cause gorillas just run shit.

745
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:48.980
They have little dicks and they're giant.

746
00:41:49.010 --> 00:41:53.240
So they'd get like a few bitches and they're like,
you get stay here.
I got Ya.

747
00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:54.470
And then he fucks them.

748
00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:57.440
But because there's no competition because there are so giant,

749
00:41:57.441 --> 00:42:01.880
so dominant because there's no competition with like these women fucking other

750
00:42:01.881 --> 00:42:05.780
men,
their ball stay little and their dicks a little.
But like champs,

751
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:09.470
you can't hold a chimp pitch and check.
Those bitches are freaks.

752
00:42:09.471 --> 00:42:13.310
They're out there and the fucking trees banging dude's behind your back and,
and,

753
00:42:13.350 --> 00:42:14.770
and bang and people and

754
00:42:15.910 --> 00:42:19.210
<v 2>say,
I was in uh,
uh,
Indonesia and I,
um,</v>

755
00:42:19.480 --> 00:42:23.950
I helped rehabilitate orangutans and advertise at the store.
Yeah,
you did.
Yeah,

756
00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:28.420
we're orangutan adolescents will will rape.
We'll try to rape a female.

757
00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:29.380
June women,
female.

758
00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:32.320
You have to be careful around them cause I'll grab you and they'll pull your

759
00:42:32.321 --> 00:42:32.640
pants.

760
00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:35.850
<v 1>Oh,
don't females in heat.
Won't they try to meet with males as well?</v>

761
00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:37.300
<v 2>I don't know.
I saw,</v>

762
00:42:37.301 --> 00:42:40.330
I saw there was a lot of sexual activity cause I was around them constantly.

763
00:42:40.331 --> 00:42:45.010
They were always like licking each other
and then,
and then fucking,

764
00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:49.230
we watched one rape a that the older adolescents will,

765
00:42:49.231 --> 00:42:53.470
will steal the little girls,
little kids and they'll,
they'll,
you know,
not humans,

766
00:42:53.471 --> 00:42:56.830
but the orangutans that were like three or three and pull him up in a tree and

767
00:42:56.831 --> 00:43:01.180
rape them.
And we watched one rape,
a fucking chicken,
uh,

768
00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:02.980
under a,
under a house.
It was,

769
00:43:02.981 --> 00:43:06.450
it was fucking a chicken masturbating and trying to fuck the chicken and the

770
00:43:06.451 --> 00:43:07.250
cause of the hall.

771
00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:10.850
<v 1>It's when we were talking about crazy the other day that we're lucky that human</v>

772
00:43:10.851 --> 00:43:13.850
beings can't breed with other animals because if they did,

773
00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:18.230
there would be a Schumann slash everything all over the world.
Monkeys,
giraffes,

774
00:43:18.410 --> 00:43:22.760
zebras.
Right.
Did you ever see Hugh Manzi?
No.
You ever seen who,
yeah,

775
00:43:22.990 --> 00:43:27.230
it's a documentary about a chimp that was a freak chimp that would walk on two

776
00:43:27.231 --> 00:43:31.520
legs and looked like a hybrid and it terrified people because they thought for

777
00:43:31.521 --> 00:43:33.320
the longest time before genetics,

778
00:43:33.321 --> 00:43:35.270
we're really pull it up because it will freak people out.

779
00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:40.070
For the longest time before they really got a grip on genetics.

780
00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:44.990
They thought that these,
that this was a human chimpanzee hybrid.

781
00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:47.900
You got to see its face.
That's not it.
That's crazy.

782
00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:50.720
You guys see its face because it didn't have much hair on its face.

783
00:43:50.750 --> 00:43:54.940
It looks that's not it.
It looked,
just pull up [inaudible] Z,

784
00:43:55.340 --> 00:44:00.050
not chimp rapes a frog.
Fuck.
But they do that.
What?
Yeah,
no,

785
00:44:00.051 --> 00:44:03.950
they do this.
That's a Humanz zy spell it right.

786
00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:09.040
Fuck z e Humanz you like a chimpanzee but humanity

787
00:44:10.350 --> 00:44:11.210
<v 5>all over the champ.</v>

788
00:44:12.180 --> 00:44:16.860
<v 1>Uh,
yes.
It was all over the chimp.
That was,
um,
that was what these,
uh,</v>

789
00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:21.390
this family,
look at it.
It's so creepy.
Look at it.
Walk Upright,

790
00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:26.760
hangs out with people and was in love with this woman.
Look how weird it's faces.

791
00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:32.460
There was something wrong with it genetically or say it had some variation,

792
00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:37.500
but it was,
uh,
especially when it was young,
it really resembled a human being.

793
00:44:37.520 --> 00:44:39.270
Look at him there.
As it got older,

794
00:44:39.271 --> 00:44:43.830
it got more and more chimp like and got hairier boat when it was younger.
Um,

795
00:44:43.831 --> 00:44:47.400
and apparently he was madly in love with the woman.
Uh,

796
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:49.320
and like that's when it became a problem.

797
00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:52.260
Like he was trying to fuck the woman all the time.
Yeah.

798
00:44:52.261 --> 00:44:56.040
Well I huge mail chimp is no joke man.
Well not only that,

799
00:44:56.070 --> 00:44:57.750
they want pussy,
you know,

800
00:44:57.751 --> 00:45:01.320
they want something like why you don't have any chimps around here for me,

801
00:45:01.350 --> 00:45:05.010
they have moods flying or rages.
They get cold and they shit.

802
00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:10.070
They have genetic like signals that are going off left and right that are trying

803
00:45:10.591 --> 00:45:12.420
to give them the reward for breeding.

804
00:45:12.450 --> 00:45:16.680
Like it's firing at full force and then you have no outlet for that.

805
00:45:16.710 --> 00:45:19.590
That's just bananas.
That's completely crazy.

806
00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:22.320
It's like what they do with tigers when they cage them and they wonder why they

807
00:45:22.321 --> 00:45:23.760
pace back and forth and back and forth.

808
00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:26.430
You're sliding a tray of meat under the door.

809
00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:28.200
You're not giving it anything to kill.

810
00:45:28.350 --> 00:45:31.050
Like this whole thing is designed to kill fee.
That's why,

811
00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:35.020
that's why it moves so fast.
That's why it has giant claws.
It's can kill things.

812
00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:35.970
So when it kills things,

813
00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:41.150
it gets this orgasm like rush of endorphins in this reward from nature because

814
00:45:42.121 --> 00:45:45.420
you're not just surviving.
You're doing what your program to do.

815
00:45:45.421 --> 00:45:47.850
You're not like chasing these animals out of desperation.

816
00:45:48.030 --> 00:45:50.760
You roll the fucking ball in front of a cat and I'll dive on it.

817
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:52.110
They're doing it for the thrill,

818
00:45:52.410 --> 00:45:56.040
so he'd taken away all the thrill out of life just so you could stare at them.

819
00:45:56.041 --> 00:45:58.980
Right.
I hate that.
That's why I don't like zoos.

820
00:45:59.220 --> 00:46:02.730
I wonder if it would be a tiger human combo.
If a person could fuck a tiger,

821
00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:07.320
they would figure out a cross Ponick DNA that's hold it down at fuck it.

822
00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:09.810
I think what they would have to do is they would have to just net it.

823
00:46:09.990 --> 00:46:12.200
It would be one dude who was a bad motherfucker.

824
00:46:12.201 --> 00:46:15.630
Want him to tiger to carry his baby,
wanted to make like tiger people.

825
00:46:15.960 --> 00:46:18.120
They thought that was like the next level and he would have to like,

826
00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:21.540
don't have to like,
it would have to be like a whole village would be involved.

827
00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:24.540
You'd have to get routed.
She can hide in the trees.
It's kind of weird.

828
00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:28.020
You'd get it up if you're a freak.
Yeah.
I guess if you're in a fucking animals,

829
00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:30.480
there's dudes are in a fucking animals.
Yeah.

830
00:46:30.690 --> 00:46:34.710
So you'd have to like get the net dropped the net down like with giant boulders

831
00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:38.400
and then everybody would have to move in somehow and you'd have to hold this

832
00:46:38.401 --> 00:46:40.560
fucker down.
No uncomfortable.

833
00:46:41.310 --> 00:46:45.270
Before they had like drugs to drug.
We don't want a drug.
The woman,

834
00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:48.480
the woman tiger.
Because then with the baby's going to come out all fucked up.

835
00:46:48.481 --> 00:46:52.890
Not only did half person,
it's retarded pans out.
Got some drugs that can maybe,

836
00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:53.880
but this is Pfizer.

837
00:46:53.881 --> 00:46:56.250
We're talking about two thousand three thousand years ago and you had to use

838
00:46:56.251 --> 00:47:00.990
Carrari and shit yet a poison them and did like a half state of paralysis and

839
00:47:00.991 --> 00:47:03.660
then stick your Dick in him.
I wonder,

840
00:47:04.110 --> 00:47:09.110
I wonder if anybody's ever fucked a tiger of throughout human history there's

841
00:47:09.961 --> 00:47:12.930
gotta be one dude.
No way to Tony last shot.
A tiger hasn't,

842
00:47:12.940 --> 00:47:17.070
hasn't tried to at least one person.
Oh,
once it's dead,
that doesn't count.

843
00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:19.490
That's not why you can't fuck tell you.

844
00:47:20.380 --> 00:47:24.000
But everybody breeding and have to have to be in a breeding like they have for

845
00:47:24.001 --> 00:47:28.320
pit bulls when they breed them that that they,
it's like a breeding mountain.

846
00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:30.070
Yeah.
A back 'em

847
00:47:30.070 --> 00:47:32.500
<v 3>up into like some stocks contraption.
Yeah.</v>

848
00:47:32.501 --> 00:47:35.110
It's like a stock but people looking at that humanity,

849
00:47:35.470 --> 00:47:39.100
you could clearly see why people would think that that was some sort of a
hybrid.

850
00:47:39.101 --> 00:47:42.250
Yeah.
I mean that was it.
That is a for Riki looking thing.

851
00:47:42.251 --> 00:47:47.080
When you see him it's so real and so human walking on two legs and he's walking

852
00:47:47.081 --> 00:47:50.170
around and he's just hanging out with people and he's got that weird hairless

853
00:47:50.171 --> 00:47:54.340
phase.
Nobody questioned it.
Nobody was like,
it's impossible.

854
00:47:54.490 --> 00:47:57.880
No one would fuck a chimp.
They immediately thought somebody fucked a chimp.

855
00:47:58.030 --> 00:47:59.290
It was like right away.

856
00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:02.980
Cause they know what our capabilities is that a woman in Connecticut who lost

857
00:48:02.981 --> 00:48:03.311
her face,

858
00:48:03.311 --> 00:48:07.830
that owner would take baths with that champ and drink wine at a long stemmed

859
00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:12.730
glasses.
She was running it.
She left that shelf fucker.
Yeah,
I think so.

860
00:48:12.850 --> 00:48:16.630
And I think that's why the other chimp killed that bitch because that chick

861
00:48:16.631 --> 00:48:19.610
probably tried to cock block.
She's probably cock blocking.

862
00:48:19.611 --> 00:48:23.260
She changed her hair that day.
She had her hair done and she came and the chimp,

863
00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:26.020
that's all was well,
it's a fucking mail.

864
00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:29.590
200 pound fucking adult chimp.

865
00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:33.070
So guess what it's called?
The very dangerous wild animal.

866
00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:35.710
My Buddy Kirin's a stunt man goes,
the only thing I don't think I said,

867
00:48:35.711 --> 00:48:38.410
what's scariest dining goes anything with chimpanzees.
I don't mess with them.

868
00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:42.940
That's what he said.
It does everything.
Fighting,
falling motorcycles.
A chance.

869
00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:47.140
Yeah,
Dude.
Fuck all that.
They grab a hold of you.

870
00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:51.400
You know you're going to lose a knows at least before somebody gets to you and

871
00:48:51.401 --> 00:48:51.601
cheer.

872
00:48:51.601 --> 00:48:56.601
Chances are you're going to lose half your face or your balls or your balls or

873
00:48:57.001 --> 00:49:01.050
your Dick.
You know,
we were talking earlier about a new Guinea.
Yeah.
Um,

874
00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:03.730
if you ever heard of those,
uh,
those tribes,

875
00:49:03.850 --> 00:49:07.930
the believe that the young boys have to ingest semen.
Yes.

876
00:49:08.290 --> 00:49:11.530
How do you know how prevalent that is?
It's also in the islands.

877
00:49:11.531 --> 00:49:13.720
What does it where they,
it's called widow strangling where a,

878
00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:14.920
if your husband dies,

879
00:49:14.950 --> 00:49:17.890
they strangle the widow and she'll cough to her brothers to do it if her

880
00:49:17.891 --> 00:49:20.290
brothers aren't around her son.
Does it?
Yeah,

881
00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:23.260
I think it's the Solomon Islands or the governor islands or something out in,

882
00:49:23.490 --> 00:49:26.230
out in like,
uh,
like near pop out and Guinea or something.

883
00:49:26.231 --> 00:49:29.230
What's the point in that wire?
This triangle.
Her fucking,

884
00:49:29.231 --> 00:49:34.150
it's a very isolated culture where some psycho came out with an idea and people

885
00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:36.130
took it as tradition and they would do it.

886
00:49:36.490 --> 00:49:41.020
It's dumb shit because when you've got us to a group of people that have had no

887
00:49:41.021 --> 00:49:45.550
contact with the outside world for Millennia,
you get these really weird,

888
00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:50.750
a strange customs that will actually stick and they can be as crazy as widows

889
00:49:51.811 --> 00:49:54.470
strangling,
by the way,
what is it in,
in,

890
00:49:54.471 --> 00:49:59.320
in India before when w w w but God and the turn of the century where,

891
00:49:59.350 --> 00:50:03.010
where,
um,
if a woman was,
if her husband was dead,

892
00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:08.160
she would be burned.
What was it called?
Um,
as a sort of a sacrifice.
Uh,

893
00:50:08.170 --> 00:50:11.560
it's called fuck what is all like Viking style.
They'd throw them on the,

894
00:50:11.650 --> 00:50:13.600
she'd be on a pile of wood and they would,

895
00:50:13.601 --> 00:50:17.080
and she would burn and they would burn her.
Um,
I know all,

896
00:50:17.081 --> 00:50:20.560
no offense to anybody who's Indian.
It was a,
it was a Hindu tradition,

897
00:50:20.561 --> 00:50:24.130
I think it was.
It was,
and I can't remember what it was,

898
00:50:24.131 --> 00:50:28.160
but there's a word for it.
It was practiced commonly,
uh,
in

899
00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:32.990
<v 2>certain parts of India.
And all I'm saying is that in every culture has very,</v>

900
00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:36.830
very sort of rather dreadful ideas of,

901
00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:41.840
of what they call culture.
Uh,
it's just Danny,
we evolve as human beings.

902
00:50:42.350 --> 00:50:44.780
It's amazing.
When the Soviets got to Afghanistan,

903
00:50:44.781 --> 00:50:47.600
they s when a girl was born,

904
00:50:47.601 --> 00:50:50.750
a lot of times there was no time or use for a girl in that,
in that village.

905
00:50:50.751 --> 00:50:54.890
And they would just throw them off cliffs,
the infants,
they would throw them off,

906
00:50:54.891 --> 00:50:57.770
throw them off class.
And that's one of the things is Soviet said.
They were like,

907
00:50:57.830 --> 00:51:02.420
this is fucking nuts.
Those,
those,
those,
uh,
you know,
I mean,
look at the,

908
00:51:02.421 --> 00:51:05.230
what just happened.
They visit videotape going all over the world.

909
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:09.290
The Afghan tribe where the,
the woman who is considered a beautiful girl,

910
00:51:09.291 --> 00:51:13.190
everybody liked her.
She was married,
some Taliban commander captures her,

911
00:51:13.460 --> 00:51:17.000
takes her off,
rapes her and apparently somebody else to as well.

912
00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:21.020
They had a big meeting.
They went and rescued her.
These,
his,

913
00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:23.330
they've got the husband's friends,
they killed the guy.

914
00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:24.710
They brought the girl back.

915
00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:29.630
They decided she had to marry the guys that she was one of our attackers or she

916
00:51:29.631 --> 00:51:32.030
probably committed adultery,
so we're going to shoot her.

917
00:51:32.031 --> 00:51:35.510
So the husband took a machine gun and shot her about six times.

918
00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:38.930
Her family came collecting the body and that's how you did it.

919
00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:42.200
And that's how you do it still in certain parts of Afghanistan and those

920
00:51:42.201 --> 00:51:44.270
backward,
um,
villages,

921
00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:48.080
human beings have always done when they're ignorant and they're not exposed to

922
00:51:48.081 --> 00:51:50.900
the right way of doing things.
They've always done things like that.

923
00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:54.710
And they still do things like amazing that it coexists with the Internet,

924
00:51:54.830 --> 00:51:59.000
the coexists with the good watching the history channel.

925
00:51:59.030 --> 00:52:00.650
But it's going on at the same time.
Well,

926
00:52:00.651 --> 00:52:03.590
but the great thing is in this gang rape in India that everybody's talking
about.

927
00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:05.640
What happened was gang rapes in India.

928
00:52:05.641 --> 00:52:08.960
I've been going on forever and the cops never really persecute,

929
00:52:08.961 --> 00:52:11.060
prosecute him and the cops look very bad.

930
00:52:11.090 --> 00:52:13.010
When this woman was raped with her friend,

931
00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:16.880
they they and assaulted with a metal bar.
She was bleeding so badly.

932
00:52:16.881 --> 00:52:18.800
They threw them out naked out of the car.

933
00:52:19.160 --> 00:52:21.410
It took 25 minutes before the cops came.

934
00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:24.470
The cops then argued for 40 minutes about who had jurisdiction.

935
00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:27.170
The cost didn't want to touch her because she was bleeding too much to the

936
00:52:27.171 --> 00:52:29.180
friend had to put her in there.
They get to the hospital.

937
00:52:29.181 --> 00:52:32.120
They still had to wait in the waiting room and then of course she died,

938
00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:34.760
but this is not an uncommon thing.

939
00:52:34.761 --> 00:52:38.750
What happened when that word got out in India for the first time was young

940
00:52:38.751 --> 00:52:43.751
college students started tweeting and organizing mass rallies saying this has

941
00:52:44.031 --> 00:52:48.110
been going on for way too fucking long.
It's always been you.
You'd get a choice.

942
00:52:48.111 --> 00:52:50.420
Another girl in India who was raped there.
There was a choice.

943
00:52:50.421 --> 00:52:55.160
This is in the lower,
this is the,
this is people who are not as educated,

944
00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:58.490
but the girl had a choice.
Mary,
your attacker,
Mary,

945
00:52:58.491 --> 00:53:02.090
one of your attackers or don't press charges.
It was a,
you know,

946
00:53:02.091 --> 00:53:05.360
somehow the woman is to blame and what's happening in,

947
00:53:05.361 --> 00:53:08.900
in these societies and all these studies is they're modernizing like you said,

948
00:53:08.901 --> 00:53:12.170
because they have access to information.
Young people who are educated and going,

949
00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:16.460
this is bullshit.
This makes our country look terrible.
This is unacceptable.

950
00:53:16.550 --> 00:53:19.160
It's been going on too long.
And that's one of the great things about,

951
00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:22.130
about the internet.
I think it's one of the greatest things about the,

952
00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:26.130
what is it about people that allows them to do something like a gang

953
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:27.630
<v 3>rape?
How does that happen?
Well,</v>

954
00:53:27.631 --> 00:53:30.900
they said that one of the young guys who was raping was reaching into her body

955
00:53:30.901 --> 00:53:35.100
and pulling out her intestines.
There you go with his hand.
There you go.
I mean,

956
00:53:35.101 --> 00:53:38.850
that's fucking unbelievably evil.
It's unbelievable evil.
It's,

957
00:53:38.851 --> 00:53:42.000
it's been going on.
That's what men do when they get in groups.

958
00:53:42.001 --> 00:53:44.010
And they're fucking sociopath's are in a gang.

959
00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:47.730
When you get that many of us together though to that crazy you,
you come from a,

960
00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:49.710
you come,
and I'm not saying it's Indian culture.

961
00:53:49.711 --> 00:53:51.600
You come from a part of the world,
uh,

962
00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:53.680
whether it's your village or whether it's your family,
where,

963
00:53:53.681 --> 00:53:58.500
where women are treated as chattel or dogs or less than human.

964
00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:00.680
And that's what happens.
That's,

965
00:54:00.730 --> 00:54:03.630
that's why we have examples of that from the beginning of time.

966
00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:05.590
It's just amazing.
That can discuss,

967
00:54:05.610 --> 00:54:10.610
cultures can degrade to that point that somehow or another you can get to the

968
00:54:11.161 --> 00:54:15.060
point where you can have gang rapes on a regular basis.
It's a common thing,

969
00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:20.450
you know,
or this new Guinea thing like that.
I mean,
it's
just,

970
00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:25.440
it's even more crazy than gang rape.
There are countless examples of that.

971
00:54:25.441 --> 00:54:29.230
You know,
it's a problem.
So it's not because it's like,
I guess,
I dunno.
It's,

972
00:54:29.231 --> 00:54:33.570
it's crazy.
They're both great problem with male dominated societies.
Actually,

973
00:54:33.571 --> 00:54:36.930
if you look at male patriarchal societies,
Eh,

974
00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:40.480
the problem with them is that they tend to be,
um,

975
00:54:40.590 --> 00:54:44.130
they will always keep women in,
in a certain place.

976
00:54:44.430 --> 00:54:49.430
And if women try to get out of that place of the problem is solved a lot of

977
00:54:50.281 --> 00:54:52.620
times with violence.
But I've also been thinking,

978
00:54:52.621 --> 00:54:55.920
and I don't have the data on this,
but matriarchal pat,
patriarchal societies,

979
00:54:56.310 --> 00:55:01.310
societies dominated by men usually are always at war with either someone or

980
00:55:01.831 --> 00:55:04.310
themselves.
There's a lot of violence in society.

981
00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:08.580
What society isn't states,
I think for the most part is,

982
00:55:08.581 --> 00:55:13.410
is if come comparison is a country that at least has dialogue about equal

983
00:55:13.411 --> 00:55:15.390
rights,
glass ceilings,

984
00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:19.350
women are in positions of power have been for a long time.
They were given,

985
00:55:19.351 --> 00:55:24.240
the vote wasn't 1934 with the suffragette movement.
Right.

986
00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:27.810
But,
but,
but that's,
that's,
that's always been,

987
00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:32.400
that's Europe for that matter.
The liberal democracy still.
I would say there was,

988
00:55:32.430 --> 00:55:36.810
there's still an inequality if you just looked at it on paper as far as wealth,

989
00:55:36.811 --> 00:55:38.610
prestige,
power,

990
00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:41.640
influence between men and women are the important things that we're talking

991
00:55:41.641 --> 00:55:43.290
about it.
The important thing is that there is a,

992
00:55:43.350 --> 00:55:46.260
there's the people know what's right versus what's wrong.

993
00:55:46.270 --> 00:55:50.400
You know why we're talking about it?
The Internet?
No,
we don't have prostitution.

994
00:55:50.730 --> 00:55:54.070
If we had legalized prostitution,
we would just like,
God damn it.

995
00:55:54.071 --> 00:55:57.810
Why are we arguing about this shit?
Jesus Christ.
Why am I'm arguing?

996
00:55:57.811 --> 00:56:02.600
I'm trying to make you happy.
So I sold my little sucks.
Junkie Island.

997
00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:06.660
It's a girl who wants help with their rent.
That's all it is.
Isn't prostitution,

998
00:56:06.661 --> 00:56:11.640
legal and Rhode Island?
I don't think so.
Somebody told me yesterday.
No,
no,

999
00:56:11.650 --> 00:56:15.390
I don't.
I May.
It's a new law.
I don't think so.
Why don't you Google it?

1000
00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:20.220
I know that it's legal in Carson city or not Carson city,
Nevada.
Uh,

1001
00:56:20.790 --> 00:56:23.950
I think it's Clark County.
One of those counties,

1002
00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:28.300
<v 1>but it's not the Vegas County,
oddly enough.
It's out in the middle of dry.</v>

1003
00:56:28.990 --> 00:56:32.050
Yeah.
Like when we went to the Bunny ranch,
we filmed a,
some we,

1004
00:56:32.051 --> 00:56:35.560
we went to the bunny ranch when I was doing the man show and I played pretty

1005
00:56:35.561 --> 00:56:37.350
women for them and we,
uh,

1006
00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:41.380
had them all like a talk about the scenes in pretty woman and like what the

1007
00:56:41.381 --> 00:56:42.400
scene meant to them.
And

1008
00:56:43.290 --> 00:56:47.860
<v 4>Dude,
it was legal up to 2009.
Really.</v>

1009
00:56:47.861 --> 00:56:49.780
And can you imagine they just lost like,

1010
00:56:49.781 --> 00:56:53.730
the best thing and we just found about in Rhode Island was legal plants.

1011
00:56:53.830 --> 00:56:58.240
What's wrong with you,
Rhode Island?
I know that.
I know that.

1012
00:56:58.380 --> 00:57:00.100
Why isn't that the best spring break place?

1013
00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:04.160
<v 1>I was really aren't 2008.
What the fuck?
Nobody even told me Shit.</v>

1014
00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:06.890
Probably Porn Stars who have to turn tricks a lot more now because they're not

1015
00:57:06.891 --> 00:57:08.120
making as much money making movies.

1016
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:12.290
I heard a girl describing that in the interview.
She's at a,
uh,

1017
00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:16.400
one of the girls to do porn and now she was at the bunny ranch and they were

1018
00:57:16.401 --> 00:57:19.940
talking about,
um,
like that too.
A lot of them.

1019
00:57:19.941 --> 00:57:23.630
It's no different that she said it's porn is just like one big brothel.

1020
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:26.420
It's just they film it this way.
It's like you're doing the same thing,

1021
00:57:26.421 --> 00:57:29.150
but we don't film it like those guys aren't my boyfriend that I'm having sex

1022
00:57:29.151 --> 00:57:32.150
with.
So that was her justification of it.
It's really,

1023
00:57:32.151 --> 00:57:35.510
it was really strange to read cause she was talking about her boyfriend that she

1024
00:57:35.511 --> 00:57:38.240
lives with and that for someone like that,
they were asked her,

1025
00:57:38.241 --> 00:57:42.470
do you do overnights because I guess overnights or like went up a hooker stays

1026
00:57:42.471 --> 00:57:45.470
the whole night and he just mauler all that.
She goes,

1027
00:57:45.471 --> 00:57:48.560
well it would have to be a lot of money to keep me away from the man that I love

1028
00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:53.420
Jesus.
And I'm like,
whoa.
Wow.
Like what kind of,
wow,
what?

1029
00:57:53.421 --> 00:57:57.200
What an odd place today.
That's a strange thinking.

1030
00:57:57.610 --> 00:58:00.980
Unusual thinking.
I don't know.
Yeah.

1031
00:58:00.981 --> 00:58:04.250
Could you imagine if that you were that guy and you just sitting at home because

1032
00:58:04.251 --> 00:58:07.820
you're a lazy fuck you.
You don't have a job.
Your girlfriend's mouth everywhere.

1033
00:58:07.821 --> 00:58:12.740
Her ass,
her mouth.
The guy's paying like five grand.
He's raw dog in her face,

1034
00:58:13.310 --> 00:58:15.180
you know,
you know?
Yes.
Yeah.

1035
00:58:15.230 --> 00:58:18.080
She's sucking as balls while he's jerking off looking in her eyes.

1036
00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:23.390
I just don't want to make out with you after that.
Yeah,
well you know,

1037
00:58:23.391 --> 00:58:26.390
there's nothing wrong with it if he likes it and she likes it,
but if you're,

1038
00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:26.990
you know,

1039
00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:31.280
some people get off on it and trying to pretend that you'll just working,

1040
00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:35.990
she ain't just working,
she's getting paid to do something that you know,

1041
00:58:36.140 --> 00:58:39.980
a lot of people do for free.
It's a weird thing when you're,
you're,

1042
00:58:39.981 --> 00:58:44.000
you were agreeing to have sex with someone that you don't want to have sex with

1043
00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:47.030
and you're doing it over money or she does want to just a re look,

1044
00:58:47.031 --> 00:58:49.130
there's nothing wrong with it.
There's nothing wrong with it,

1045
00:58:49.160 --> 00:58:52.130
but there's a reason why it's looked upon.
Weirdly,

1046
00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:57.520
it's because it does sort of bypass the whole social system that's in place

1047
00:58:57.831 --> 00:59:00.710
that's Sorta,
Kinda designed to make people be nice to each other.

1048
00:59:00.950 --> 00:59:05.750
Like the reason why sex is like people like having sex with you so they like
you.

1049
00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:08.240
They,
like you said,
it gives you incentive to be nice to them,

1050
00:59:08.241 --> 00:59:11.100
to be a person that they want to be around.
They want to give you affection,

1051
00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:12.980
you want to give them affection.
It becomes mutual.

1052
00:59:13.490 --> 00:59:16.400
And then for some people it's just like,
I don't have time for that.

1053
00:59:17.140 --> 00:59:20.570
I give you some money and then I fucking treat you like shit and spit in your

1054
00:59:20.571 --> 00:59:22.230
mouth.
And like

1055
00:59:23.170 --> 00:59:25.940
<v 4>it's Rhode Island place by the way,
is my new destination.</v>

1056
00:59:25.941 --> 00:59:29.090
When time travel it becomes illegal because now it's also,

1057
00:59:29.091 --> 00:59:31.880
you could be 16 to be like a stripper or a prostitute.

1058
00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:36.970
Back in 2009 that was the age of consent was 16 so there's all these 16 year old

1059
00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:40.210
hookers in Rhode Island and none of us knew about Rhode Island.

1060
00:59:40.250 --> 00:59:41.540
2009 for some reason

1061
00:59:43.690 --> 00:59:47.200
<v 1>dark.
I couldn't do that because I'd have to.
I don't want any,</v>

1062
00:59:47.201 --> 00:59:51.070
she keep her secret.
That's too fucked up,
man.
No,

1063
00:59:51.071 --> 00:59:54.700
not 16 I was a weird place.
I used to do a lot of gigs in Rhode Island,

1064
00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:57.280
which is super small or what's the dude?
Yeah,
it's tiny.

1065
00:59:57.281 --> 01:00:01.420
I think it's the tiniest state in the union.
It's um,
is it?
Yeah,
it's really,

1066
01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:03.910
it's really little man.
He could drive through in a couple of hours.

1067
01:00:04.690 --> 01:00:05.501
I did a lot of gigs.

1068
01:00:05.501 --> 01:00:09.650
There isn't [inaudible] Rhode Island where Whitey Bulger ran the underground?
No,

1069
01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:11.600
no.
South Boston.
South Boston.
Yeah.

1070
01:00:11.710 --> 01:00:16.030
That crazy balls or ran the underground and his brother was the mayor.

1071
01:00:16.270 --> 01:00:20.170
Not only,
no,
no,
no,
no.
His brother was,
uh,
some,

1072
01:00:20.171 --> 01:00:23.650
some other big time politician,
but more importantly,

1073
01:00:23.651 --> 01:00:25.540
he was an FBI informant the entire time.

1074
01:00:26.020 --> 01:00:31.020
So he was ratting out all these other bad people and then getting them killed.

1075
01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:34.960
Like if they would turn on him,
like we would say,
yeah,
they would say,
hey,

1076
01:00:34.961 --> 01:00:37.660
this guy's about to testify against Ya.
And they could kill them.

1077
01:00:37.870 --> 01:00:41.770
Like the FBI would warn him so that he would keep,
like,

1078
01:00:42.010 --> 01:00:45.640
he would keep giving them people to arrest,
you know,
so they would,
they would,

1079
01:00:45.850 --> 01:00:49.150
they were in business together and the FBI would look the other way if he was

1080
01:00:49.151 --> 01:00:52.030
selling drugs or if he was doing certain things,
even murder.

1081
01:00:52.031 --> 01:00:55.510
They look the other way with for murder.
It's really unbelievably fucked up.

1082
01:00:55.511 --> 01:00:59.830
When you look at the whole story about how complicit the FBI was really a movie

1083
01:00:59.831 --> 01:01:04.150
about that.
I mean the departed was sort of a,

1084
01:01:04.900 --> 01:01:09.510
an artistic rendition rendition of it.
It wasn't really accurate there.

1085
01:01:09.550 --> 01:01:12.410
They had some artistic license they use,
but it was sort of,
uh,

1086
01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:16.630
a lot of it was on the Lam for like 30 years in Santa Monica,
man,

1087
01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:19.960
Sam's living in Santa Monica.
And they found him because of his wife,

1088
01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:23.630
his wife or his girlfriend,
mouthy bitch saying,
I went,
it was,
you know,

1089
01:01:23.650 --> 01:01:27.010
they fight and yell and scream at each other apparently.
And people,

1090
01:01:27.070 --> 01:01:29.110
people were looking into them because of that,

1091
01:01:29.111 --> 01:01:31.440
because they would like violently yell at each other.
Yeah.

1092
01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:33.490
And apparently he would like he'd,
he'd be,

1093
01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:35.380
they'd be talking and then all of a sudden I didn't know where he'd go.

1094
01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:37.690
All right,
let's go.
Come on,
let's get out of here.
I'm tired of this.

1095
01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:41.290
Like he would just fly off the handle.
Well,
he probably was really bored.

1096
01:01:41.530 --> 01:01:44.530
The guy ran a crime empire forever and then all of a sudden he's hanging out

1097
01:01:44.531 --> 01:01:48.340
with some crazy bitch in an apartment and you know,

1098
01:01:48.341 --> 01:01:51.820
you got to pretend to be Sam Smith and hammer or whatever the fuck you are now.

1099
01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:53.110
I think a lot of criminals.
That's true.

1100
01:01:53.111 --> 01:01:55.500
That's like the biggest thing is the juice.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1101
01:01:55.570 --> 01:01:59.020
I should have went to Mexico.
Shit,
I'm like gangster dawn till dusk style.

1102
01:01:59.710 --> 01:02:03.470
You know,
watched his Santa Monica,
they'll let you in to Mexico.
Nice.

1103
01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.050
Come on son.
Get out of here.
You got to go to Mexico.
Should have gone to Mexico.

1104
01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:11.950
Get a nice place near Cabo.
Blend right in and get a Tan.
Shave your head.

1105
01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:13.840
Let me know what the fuck you are.
It's true

1106
01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:18.740
<v 4>medical marijuana and Rhode Island from starting at 2006 to 2006 to 2009.</v>

1107
01:02:18.741 --> 01:02:20.040
And it's meet there when

1108
01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:22.890
<v 1>time machines are,
has got the first clubs,
right.
Pot Clubs,</v>

1109
01:02:22.891 --> 01:02:24.960
now they're about to open one,

1110
01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:28.260
but it doesn't say anything about smoking pot in public place.

1111
01:02:28.261 --> 01:02:29.490
The law does not allow that.

1112
01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:32.460
And so I suppose kind of building the place that you've seen in your own home.

1113
01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:37.890
Yeah,
you can at bars,
but they don't have licenses for like,
it's a situation.

1114
01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:40.170
So what it's going to be as like you're gonna have to get a membership.

1115
01:02:40.530 --> 01:02:44.430
That's how they do in certain states.
They have a that with booze.

1116
01:02:44.730 --> 01:02:48.630
There was certain states,
it wasn't Utah,
it wasn't just Utah.

1117
01:02:49.230 --> 01:02:54.090
Where was it?
North Carolina,
maybe I forget,
but it was back in the day,

1118
01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:56.760
you had to uh,
go to a club.

1119
01:02:56.940 --> 01:03:00.210
There were certain clubs like after a certain time at night and you could go

1120
01:03:00.211 --> 01:03:01.890
there,
but you had to pay for a membership.

1121
01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:07.020
Like they had a like cigars and I think one of them even had strippers and he

1122
01:03:07.021 --> 01:03:10.800
had to like be a member.
You had to like pay because there's laws.

1123
01:03:10.801 --> 01:03:13.500
So the way to get around the laws to make it private,
so I'll,

1124
01:03:13.501 --> 01:03:15.890
everybody becomes a member,
they'll go there and give your id,

1125
01:03:15.900 --> 01:03:19.080
fill out your name and your address and give him 20 bucks to whatever the fuck

1126
01:03:19.081 --> 01:03:22.320
it is.
A guy gives you a key.
Now you remember,
it's like silly.

1127
01:03:22.350 --> 01:03:24.840
It's silly of shit ever.
But that's the only way to do it,
right?

1128
01:03:25.350 --> 01:03:27.180
They had to like skirt around the law.

1129
01:03:27.181 --> 01:03:29.640
So what they're gonna do with this Colorado thing isn't going to make it so that

1130
01:03:29.641 --> 01:03:30.450
you,
you know,

1131
01:03:30.450 --> 01:03:34.260
you're a member and you'd go there and then you could all smoke weed together,

1132
01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:37.920
but someone's going to fuck that up.

1133
01:03:38.550 --> 01:03:42.930
The real problem with it is that it's only two states and it's not federal yet.

1134
01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:47.250
I hope this is the beginning,
but I hope that it's not fuel for blow back.

1135
01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:49.860
I hope that they don't fuck it up somehow.

1136
01:03:50.580 --> 01:03:53.030
And you also have to be careful of um,

1137
01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:56.610
agent provocateurs and all sorts of different people that are going to try to,

1138
01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:59.940
if the DEA was smart and they wanted to keep that business going.

1139
01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:01.650
And I know that there's people in the DEA,

1140
01:04:01.651 --> 01:04:03.870
they're smart and I know there's people in Dea,

1141
01:04:03.871 --> 01:04:05.130
they want to keep that business going.

1142
01:04:05.160 --> 01:04:07.910
One of the things they do is they influence raise,

1143
01:04:07.920 --> 01:04:10.650
they go into the business of arresting people for selling drugs.

1144
01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:14.790
As soon as drugs become legal,
there's a whole lot less jobs for DEA people.

1145
01:04:14.940 --> 01:04:16.470
So that's what the lobby's about.

1146
01:04:16.471 --> 01:04:18.390
That's what the Tasco a whole lot less people in jail,

1147
01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:22.980
prison guard lobby also lobbied very hard to make sure that people don't make

1148
01:04:22.981 --> 01:04:26.000
drugs illegal.
But one of the things that um,

1149
01:04:26.100 --> 01:04:28.380
undercover cops and undercover DEA guys have done,

1150
01:04:28.410 --> 01:04:33.270
it's forced people to buy and sell much more than they really needed.
Like they,

1151
01:04:33.430 --> 01:04:34.800
there's a guy that's in jail,

1152
01:04:34.801 --> 01:04:37.760
there was a big article about it and Rolling Stone magazine and a,

1153
01:04:37.770 --> 01:04:39.660
this DEA guy was undercover,

1154
01:04:39.850 --> 01:04:42.780
turned out to be a junkie himself when he went to rehab after he quit.

1155
01:04:42.781 --> 01:04:45.900
The force and it was,
was a actually a discharge.

1156
01:04:45.901 --> 01:04:49.070
He was fired because of impropriety.
Um,

1157
01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:52.890
set this guy up and asked this guy to,
uh,

1158
01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:58.170
to get him some weed and gave him some money for it and then said,
listen man,

1159
01:04:58.230 --> 01:05:00.150
um,
you know,
I can get you,
you know,

1160
01:05:00.180 --> 01:05:03.270
$100,000 if you can get me some coke and you know,

1161
01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:06.030
I need this amount of weed and this amount of coke.
And the guy's like,

1162
01:05:06.031 --> 01:05:09.330
I can't do that.
He goes,
look,
look,
look,
I'll set you up with the people.

1163
01:05:09.331 --> 01:05:12.240
It's cool man.
Trust me.
I just need you to like,
you know,

1164
01:05:12.330 --> 01:05:15.840
dot all the i's and cross all the t's and,

1165
01:05:15.841 --> 01:05:17.100
and you're going to make all this money.

1166
01:05:17.170 --> 01:05:21.490
So he literally set up the whole fakes and trap.
Yeah.
It's complete.

1167
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:25.910
Total in and not only out of the guy was like 19 years old.
So dumb young.
Yeah.

1168
01:05:25.911 --> 01:05:28.540
It would've been the sound of a hundred grand.
I mean,
living in the south,

1169
01:05:28.750 --> 01:05:30.070
that easy,
uneducated,

1170
01:05:30.100 --> 01:05:33.130
dumb young living in Georgia and this guy gets off on sending him to jail.

1171
01:05:33.131 --> 01:05:34.480
He's in jail for the rest of his life.

1172
01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:37.420
He's in jail for the rest of his life and he was just a young kid that was,

1173
01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:41.550
he thought I was going to sell a dude who had already sold weed to started to

1174
01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:44.270
sell him some more weed.
Hey man,
you made the world safe for,
yeah.

1175
01:05:44.530 --> 01:05:48.670
It's unbelievable how they can sort of just rope kids in and,

1176
01:05:48.770 --> 01:05:52.540
and they do it like you.
How could you do that to a teenager?
I mean,

1177
01:05:52.541 --> 01:05:56.440
how could you pretend that you're doing,
you're serving and protecting.

1178
01:05:56.620 --> 01:05:59.950
How can you pretend that you're doing anything that's like trying to keep people

1179
01:05:59.951 --> 01:06:01.360
safe?
You're just like,

1180
01:06:01.660 --> 01:06:06.550
you found a hole through the system and it hasn't been homemade.
Illegal.

1181
01:06:06.551 --> 01:06:08.850
Yeah.
It's a hard case.
I hope that's a,
Ah,

1182
01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:11.650
I hope that's a rare case that you're talking.
I hope it is too,

1183
01:06:11.651 --> 01:06:13.510
but I don't think it is.
I think it's a,

1184
01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:15.430
I think it's pretty common that people get set up.

1185
01:06:15.820 --> 01:06:18.070
I think it's pretty fucking family.
I think if they find out you're,

1186
01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:21.430
you're growing and selling large amounts of blow your,
your,
your fucking,

1187
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:25.750
it's not just that.
There was a kid who was arrested in Florida.

1188
01:06:25.751 --> 01:06:27.580
He was 17 years old.
He's an honor roll student.

1189
01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:30.700
He was arrested by an undercover cop who pretended to be his girlfriend.

1190
01:06:30.701 --> 01:06:34.970
I remember that dude.
Yeah,
she's 25 years old and hot.
Okay.

1191
01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:37.180
Hot this dirty Twat.

1192
01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:41.440
She got close to this kid and he wanted to give her or the weed for free as a

1193
01:06:41.441 --> 01:06:44.860
gift because she asked him to get her weed.
He wanted to give it to her for free.

1194
01:06:44.890 --> 01:06:46.900
Like I got it for you.
She's like,
no,
you got to have the money.

1195
01:06:46.901 --> 01:06:51.550
Please take the money.
So he takes the money.
Boom.
He's arrested.
He's a sociopath.

1196
01:06:51.610 --> 01:06:55.030
She's a raging cunt and she thought she was just doing her job.

1197
01:06:55.060 --> 01:06:59.830
She's doing her job.
He's an honor roll student.
Okay.
No weed in his system.

1198
01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:02.590
He wasn't a drug dealer in any way,
shape or form.

1199
01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:05.590
He just met a girl and he was in love with her Wa and one of the reasons why

1200
01:07:05.591 --> 01:07:08.410
he's in love with it because he probably understood that she was a woman.

1201
01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:12.730
It probably was confusing and 17 a 25 year old,
that's the,

1202
01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:17.320
that's the holy grail.
You'll do anything.
He didn't know she was 25 my pinky off,

1203
01:07:17.321 --> 01:07:21.580
he whatever.
He didn't know she was 25 but she was so teasing him,
teasing him.

1204
01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:26.620
She was so powerful.
That's the,
the amount of influence that a 25 year old.
Yeah,

1205
01:07:27.130 --> 01:07:27.941
the amount of influence.

1206
01:07:27.941 --> 01:07:31.420
25 year old woman has over 17 year old boy is fucking staggering.

1207
01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:33.940
I mean that's like,
she's like a wizard.

1208
01:07:33.941 --> 01:07:38.020
Of course she got this poor fucking kid to go.

1209
01:07:38.530 --> 01:07:42.010
She was kind of a backlash,
wasn't there?
How about that?
Oh yes,
of course.

1210
01:07:42.130 --> 01:07:44.350
But nobody got arrested.
Nobody wants their job.

1211
01:07:45.970 --> 01:07:49.300
It was called Operation d d minus or something like that.

1212
01:07:49.301 --> 01:07:53.890
Something stupid dumb cunts.
21 jump street.

1213
01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:58.020
Some fucking bullshit.
So stupid man.
It's the idea that you,

1214
01:07:58.030 --> 01:08:02.530
your tax dollars,
Mexico.
Now it's dealing with the violence of the drugs.

1215
01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:06.040
Think it's the underwritten laws.
Look,
you can,
you can sell drugs,

1216
01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:11.100
stop fucking cutting heads off and leaving them in squares because it's illegal.

1217
01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:14.260
So it means the same thing that happened in the 1920s with alcohol.

1218
01:08:15.090 --> 01:08:15.980
Fuck is it legal?
It's going to

1219
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:19.080
<v 3>track those kinds of people,
those kinds of people that are willing to kill.</v>

1220
01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:23.720
Like you know anybody they have to.
Do you watch uh,
that um,
uh,

1221
01:08:24.230 --> 01:08:27.550
boardwalk empire?
No,
I haven't watched it yet.
Good show.
I'm,

1222
01:08:27.551 --> 01:08:29.870
I'm obsessed right now and watching,
uh,

1223
01:08:29.871 --> 01:08:32.540
I'm on my fourth season of breaking bad and that's,

1224
01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:35.150
that's a mindblowing show to me.
It's a mind blowing show,
you know,
you know,

1225
01:08:35.151 --> 01:08:39.100
it's just as good homeland.
I hear,
oh I've seen five episodes.

1226
01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:43.280
I'm waiting to watch it.
That's my next Claire Danes is a bad ass bitch.

1227
01:08:43.640 --> 01:08:48.230
She is fucking bad ass.
Yeah.
That chicken act or fucking ass off.

1228
01:08:48.231 --> 01:08:51.650
She might be the best female actor on the planet earth.
Really?

1229
01:08:52.170 --> 01:08:54.860
Well I would say I'm glad I got my money on that crazy bitch.

1230
01:08:55.400 --> 01:09:00.310
Especially if she's playing crazy dude.
She gets an a plus five star Tommy.

1231
01:09:00.350 --> 01:09:04.760
Cause that's my next dude.
That's my next thing.
She is fucking some bad ass.

1232
01:09:04.761 --> 01:09:07.910
Great TV out there.
There is now.
Yeah.
I don't know what's going on.

1233
01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:09.020
Why is there so much good stuff?

1234
01:09:09.050 --> 01:09:12.680
I think because movies are so impossible to make.
Is that what it is?
Yeah.

1235
01:09:12.681 --> 01:09:16.520
You can't get money for them.
They went and you can never get the actor you want.

1236
01:09:16.670 --> 01:09:19.880
You can't get the,
you can't do anything except that it's,
it's corporate,

1237
01:09:19.881 --> 01:09:23.810
you know,
but the money speaks and that's what counts.
And so you want to,

1238
01:09:23.811 --> 01:09:28.220
you want to do a movie and they have this great actress in mind like Claire

1239
01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:31.220
Danes and they go,
no,
it has to be Heather Graham cause she's popular overseas.

1240
01:09:31.430 --> 01:09:35.960
And you're like,
what the fuck am I doing?
So all the talent has moved to TV.

1241
01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:38.540
People are like,
I'm going to make TV.
Fuck,
fuck film.

1242
01:09:38.620 --> 01:09:39.890
It's also when you do a film,

1243
01:09:39.891 --> 01:09:42.620
you've got to go somewhere for six months and it's sucks.

1244
01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:45.830
At least if you're doing a TV show and then you know,

1245
01:09:45.831 --> 01:09:48.910
nobody will watch you get one shot and the bad reviews,
you're fucked.
Right?

1246
01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:51.770
If you're doing a TV show,
you can film it somewhere.

1247
01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:54.500
You go somewhere and yet you get a house there and you're,
you know,

1248
01:09:54.501 --> 01:09:57.350
maybe this is your new place where you live,
but at least you can have a home.

1249
01:09:57.380 --> 01:10:00.920
Right?
These people that like,
like Kevin James,
I talked to him,

1250
01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:04.490
he's like six months in one hotel,
six months in another hotel.

1251
01:10:04.491 --> 01:10:08.240
His stays in the hotels for months.
Yeah.
Fuck,
I just did it.
I was just,

1252
01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:12.440
and at the lowest and Atlanta Blah.
It's not,
it's not fun.

1253
01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:15.320
Even if you're staying in a suite and it's never,
yeah,
I don't mind.

1254
01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:16.670
Like when I do gigs on the road,

1255
01:10:16.671 --> 01:10:19.560
I stay in a hotel for a weekend and I go back home.
That's fine.
That's,

1256
01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:23.790
that's easy.
But that's six months.
Shit,
that shit's for the birds.
You know,

1257
01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:27.080
people don't realize that.
A weird lifestyle that the acting,

1258
01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:31.070
I always say people saw how I show at movies are really made people magazine,

1259
01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:34.720
US magazine.
And I'll be out of business cause it's not as glamorous.
It's the,

1260
01:10:34.730 --> 01:10:38.120
it's you're literally shooting a page a day maybe,

1261
01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:42.590
which means you're doing the same thing over and over again.
And it's just not,

1262
01:10:42.680 --> 01:10:47.330
well,
if it's a great movie though,
it's really fun.
Like even like,

1263
01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:48.620
which wasn't a great movie,

1264
01:10:48.621 --> 01:10:51.380
but the movie's zookeeper that it did little kids moving.
Yeah,
Kevin.

1265
01:10:51.550 --> 01:10:55.340
It was fun because I like Kevin,
he's fun and there was a fun movie to do.

1266
01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:59.120
It was fun.
We were sitting here around Comedians by the way.
It's great,

1267
01:10:59.410 --> 01:11:01.220
but also be around a bunch of act like my,

1268
01:11:01.370 --> 01:11:05.000
one of the guys that did the movie with,
uh,
I didn't tell you this,

1269
01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:09.350
one of the guys,
I want to say his name and I did a movie with a riding along.

1270
01:11:09.530 --> 01:11:14.160
He had just been in Lincoln with Dan Day Lewis on that set.

1271
01:11:14.970 --> 01:11:17.760
<v 2>Daniel Day Lewis,
he spoke to Daniel Day Lewis,
you know,</v>

1272
01:11:17.761 --> 01:11:22.080
when he talked to them about current events in 1865.
Okay.

1273
01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:24.570
That's everyone referred to him as mister president.

1274
01:11:24.571 --> 01:11:28.030
So he was completely in character.
Ah.

1275
01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:31.200
And that that whole,
that whole place,
dude,

1276
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:35.700
current events set was quiet unless it,
Spielberg was talking to the actor.

1277
01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:40.800
It was quiet.
From what I keep it,
you can keep your wig,

1278
01:11:40.860 --> 01:11:44.340
your character and your fucking movie.
I got no fucking,

1279
01:11:44.341 --> 01:11:47.490
I got no attention span anyway so I would have been fired immediately cause I

1280
01:11:47.491 --> 01:11:50.100
would have been fucking around the whole time.
I'm not an acting,

1281
01:11:50.101 --> 01:11:52.440
I just want to hang out and get paid and be a silly goose.

1282
01:11:53.070 --> 01:11:57.510
You don't want to do like serious work by the way.
I had,

1283
01:11:57.550 --> 01:12:00.600
I had such a good time in this thing.
But you know,
ice cube,
he's a great guy.

1284
01:12:00.870 --> 01:12:04.020
Laurence Fishburne who happens to be a fan of yours.
I did.
I tell you this,

1285
01:12:04.460 --> 01:12:08.100
the series here.
Um,
yeah,
that was cool.
It was good.
Then I got to,

1286
01:12:08.101 --> 01:12:12.130
I got to eat dinner with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Yeah,
you told me that.

1287
01:12:12.990 --> 01:12:15.510
That seems pretty straight.
I was with John Leguizamo and he goes,

1288
01:12:15.511 --> 01:12:17.820
just stick around.
Someone's coming on.
He comes back with his assistant,

1289
01:12:17.821 --> 01:12:18.390
sits down,

1290
01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:20.970
has a little cup of butternut squash soup and I talked to him about California

1291
01:12:20.971 --> 01:12:21.804
politics.

1292
01:12:21.930 --> 01:12:26.430
<v 1>No,
he's doing another version of Conan.
No.
Yeah,
yeah.</v>

1293
01:12:26.431 --> 01:12:31.350
He's going to do Kona.
And again,
old cone.
An old cone in,
see there was Robert E.

1294
01:12:31.350 --> 01:12:34.890
Howard,
the guy who wrote Conan wrote Conan through his whole life.

1295
01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:37.090
He wrote code man.
No,

1296
01:12:37.370 --> 01:12:42.030
I mean Conan rope Conan's life from a young man to an old king.

1297
01:12:42.430 --> 01:12:46.680
So he's going to do the old king version and he's going to uh,

1298
01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:51.360
go and,
um,
you know,
and play Kona and towards the end,

1299
01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:56.010
because that was like in like a lot of the older books,
some of the best books.

1300
01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:58.440
In fact,
some of the,
uh,
not the older books,

1301
01:12:58.480 --> 01:13:03.380
the more recent books before he ended it,
ended it in his thirties.
Um,

1302
01:13:03.660 --> 01:13:07.140
but he,
he had written about Kona and as being,
you know,

1303
01:13:07.141 --> 01:13:10.170
a king sitting on the phone and forced back into action again,

1304
01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:11.790
I believes in his sixties.
Yep.

1305
01:13:11.850 --> 01:13:16.080
<v 2>I remember,
I remember that.
I read every book that he ever,
every single book.</v>

1306
01:13:16.081 --> 01:13:17.060
Robert Howard ever.

1307
01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:20.040
<v 1>Yeah,
I wrote a lot.
I read a lot of his stuff.
The crawl,</v>

1308
01:13:20.041 --> 01:13:24.360
the conqueror and all that other shit too.
Surfer.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He

1309
01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:28.200
<v 2>was actually amazing books because especially the way they would open,</v>

1310
01:13:28.350 --> 01:13:32.310
you just have this description of this,
this giant with smoldering blue,

1311
01:13:32.311 --> 01:13:36.600
volcanic blue eyes,
just cutting a path of crimson through all these sort of,

1312
01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:40.740
these,
these,
these orcs or whatever.
And then he would just stand there and wait.

1313
01:13:40.741 --> 01:13:43.430
There was one survivor and he would stand there and he looked up at the,

1314
01:13:43.690 --> 01:13:47.970
that the giant with,
with his,
his black dreaded hair just covered in blood,

1315
01:13:47.971 --> 01:13:51.010
dreaded in his eyes.
And he's like,
who are you?
And you just hear,

1316
01:13:51.011 --> 01:13:54.800
he'd always answer the same way.
He'd go,
I am calling in some area.

1317
01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:58.350
You're like,
oh,
leave.
The writing was really good.

1318
01:13:58.370 --> 01:14:01.170
Oh it was the first time I ever read something.
I was like,
Holy Shit.

1319
01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:03.240
And I just had to disappointment in my life that I,

1320
01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:07.530
I'm five 11 one 70 well that's cause you don't do anything about it.

1321
01:14:07.590 --> 01:14:12.340
I fucking lift.
I lift weights.
I've worked out with you and I,
there's a level

1322
01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:15.970
<v 1>of intensity that you need to come to.
You kidding me?</v>

1323
01:14:17.300 --> 01:14:20.170
Anybody want to touch this interesting thing about Robert Howard?
Is he like,

1324
01:14:20.171 --> 01:14:24.010
he like stayed at home.
It was kind of a shut in.
He was like a really weird guy.

1325
01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:26.860
He was also a sickly guy.
What,

1326
01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:29.110
that's why I wrote about this guy who was invincible.

1327
01:14:29.111 --> 01:14:32.770
This guy with insane genetics.
We just cut people down with swords,

1328
01:14:35.250 --> 01:14:36.580
muscularity and stuff.

1329
01:14:37.810 --> 01:14:41.110
Did you ever see the Vincent D'onofrio movie where he played robbery?
Howard?
No.

1330
01:14:41.290 --> 01:14:46.200
Yeah,
I forgot what it's called.
I never saw it,
um,
off.
I'll look it up right now.

1331
01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:49.950
Um,
but uh,
apparently it's pretty good.

1332
01:14:50.760 --> 01:14:52.760
A lot of people don't know who Robert Howard is.

1333
01:14:52.761 --> 01:14:56.080
This is really kind of interesting.
Well,
you know,
Carmen,

1334
01:14:57.730 --> 01:15:00.520
the uh,
the new Conan,
the guy looked really good.

1335
01:15:00.550 --> 01:15:02.290
He looked like he was a pretty good Cohen,

1336
01:15:02.740 --> 01:15:06.400
but the movie suck the fat one and it's too bad because the,

1337
01:15:06.401 --> 01:15:08.170
the whole wide world is the name of the movie.

1338
01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:11.880
He really does look at that guy's ass Samoan.
He's a,

1339
01:15:12.340 --> 01:15:16.120
I've met him a couple times.
Um,
used to wine.
Is He?
Yeah,
a lot.

1340
01:15:16.130 --> 01:15:20.720
A lot of Polynesians and he's a big striking guy,
man.
Yeah.

1341
01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:23.680
He's just like,
he's just fucking like,
you're like Jesus.

1342
01:15:23.681 --> 01:15:26.530
He looks like he does look like a cartoon character.
He came to the UFC.

1343
01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:30.250
I'm way back before Conan came out because of the UFC was sponsoring the movie

1344
01:15:30.570 --> 01:15:32.800
and a or the movie rather.
We're sponsoring that you have to say.

1345
01:15:32.801 --> 01:15:36.760
So we interviewed him and shit.
It was like a legit giant hops.
Six foot five.

1346
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:40.330
How about Cain Velasquez?
I was incredible.
Incredible fight.

1347
01:15:40.480 --> 01:15:43.750
My Buddy Karen said to me before the fight,
he goes,
I said,

1348
01:15:43.751 --> 01:15:44.531
what's going to happen?
He goes,

1349
01:15:44.531 --> 01:15:47.500
I think Keynes gonna Maul him and he's not going to have a chance to breathe
out.

1350
01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:49.770
So what do you mean?
Cause he put his head in his chest and he's going to be,

1351
01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:52.480
he's just going to put a wrestling pace on him and he's going to beat the shit

1352
01:15:52.481 --> 01:15:55.090
out of him.
He's not going to step back and reset.
That's not what I tell him.

1353
01:15:55.270 --> 01:15:56.103
Sure enough,

1354
01:15:56.530 --> 01:16:00.850
I just watching someone who's as good and powerful as junior dos Santos get get

1355
01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:05.230
picked up and thrown on the ground by that guy.
Well he caught them.

1356
01:16:05.390 --> 01:16:06.800
The big thing was um,

1357
01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:10.540
not just the wrestling cause he wrestled around and put them down.
But yeah,

1358
01:16:10.541 --> 01:16:12.490
he cracked him when he cracked him with that right hand.

1359
01:16:12.491 --> 01:16:16.240
He heard him bad and he was never the same again.
He never could recover.

1360
01:16:16.241 --> 01:16:17.770
His endurance never recovered.

1361
01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:20.890
It says a lot about junior dos Santos though to be able to keep coming back

1362
01:16:20.891 --> 01:16:25.630
anyway and keep fighting like such as what,
what a stud.
His heart's amazing.

1363
01:16:25.631 --> 01:16:29.110
He just got,
when you get people don't understand like oh he was out of shape.

1364
01:16:29.111 --> 01:16:33.490
Like you don't know when you get hit it removes like all your endurance.

1365
01:16:33.730 --> 01:16:36.520
Like there's,
there's something crazy that happens to you when you get rocked.

1366
01:16:36.521 --> 01:16:40.360
It's like you want to call up and die.
You could be training for six months,

1367
01:16:40.361 --> 01:16:43.690
you could get up every morning and eat blueberries and run sprints up hills.

1368
01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:47.560
But when somebody punches you in the face,
you,
but that's right.

1369
01:16:47.590 --> 01:16:50.350
It's because your system is in full panic mode.

1370
01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:53.410
You just got hit with a piston,
you know,

1371
01:16:53.411 --> 01:16:55.880
from a 240 pound Mexican blam.

1372
01:16:56.020 --> 01:16:59.560
I mean he just uncorked that shit on your chin.
Your legs went wobbly.

1373
01:16:59.561 --> 01:17:03.010
Sparks went through your brain.
You're barely conscious right now.

1374
01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:06.250
Barely conscious.
So when he picks you up and dumps you,
when you're back,

1375
01:17:06.251 --> 01:17:09.690
now you lost even more consciousness.
You're barely hanging on.

1376
01:17:09.691 --> 01:17:11.510
He's just thumping you in the fucking head.

1377
01:17:11.600 --> 01:17:14.780
So at the end of the round when the bell ends and you get up like your,

1378
01:17:15.210 --> 01:17:18.280
he was barely there,
had come on and take some much.
Yeah,

1379
01:17:18.530 --> 01:17:23.390
you got cracked with a couple big punches and I was so impressed that he was

1380
01:17:23.391 --> 01:17:26.660
still there for the fifth rounds.
So many guys would have found a way out.

1381
01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:29.150
So many guys would have just curl up.

1382
01:17:29.151 --> 01:17:31.730
So much character and courage to stay in there with that guy.

1383
01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:34.730
And he started to get a second wind.
We're on the fourth and fifth rounds.

1384
01:17:34.731 --> 01:17:37.280
He started getting second when he was starting to throw some dangerous punches.

1385
01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:39.650
They didn't really connect clean.
But man,

1386
01:17:39.651 --> 01:17:41.420
if they did it could have changed a lot of shit.

1387
01:17:41.421 --> 01:17:43.760
He's so he threw a couple of laptops.
I was like,

1388
01:17:43.761 --> 01:17:46.790
God damn of one of those hits we might see a totally different fight.

1389
01:17:46.820 --> 01:17:50.150
That's right.
That's happened.
We've seen that.
Mick Brennan,
Shawn's last fight,

1390
01:17:50.330 --> 01:17:52.430
Brendan shops,
last fight.
He was um,

1391
01:17:52.610 --> 01:17:55.370
think it was his last fight where he was um,

1392
01:17:55.520 --> 01:17:59.570
finding big Ben Rothwell and he cracked big Ben Rothwell and they were in,

1393
01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:02.090
they were in a gunfight and all saw,
boom.

1394
01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:05.090
Rothwell uncorked is fucking big left hook and he's down.

1395
01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:08.960
Like you can happen that suddenly,
especially with heavyweights.

1396
01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:11.390
Well cause heavyweights have the same kind of head.
I mean,
you know,

1397
01:18:11.391 --> 01:18:13.100
Brendan's head isn't that big.

1398
01:18:13.430 --> 01:18:16.160
I always tease him because he's head is normal size to his huge body.

1399
01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:18.800
I sent him a video the other day,
I was like Ben and listen,

1400
01:18:18.801 --> 01:18:22.130
I came in when I said,
but,
but I'll actually see him tonight.
But he,

1401
01:18:22.160 --> 01:18:27.050
but you know when he's had six,
five to 50 and just in sick athlete.
But you know,

1402
01:18:27.051 --> 01:18:30.100
when you get hit with a head,
your head can only take so much off.

1403
01:18:30.110 --> 01:18:33.650
250 pound man who knows how to punch connects with your jaw.

1404
01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:35.420
I don't give a shit who you are.

1405
01:18:35.450 --> 01:18:38.360
Did you see your Fabio Maldonado versus Glover to share?

1406
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:43.390
Did you see that felt [inaudible] it was in Brazil maybe four or five months

1407
01:18:43.881 --> 01:18:44.870
ago.
Anyway,

1408
01:18:45.050 --> 01:18:50.050
Fabio Maldonado is getting mauled Glover to shares off fucking savage.

1409
01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:55.220
He's beaten the shit out of Fabio.
I mean,
his face is bloody and swollen.

1410
01:18:55.221 --> 01:18:58.700
Takes him down,
smashing them.
I mean,
it's just unbelievable.

1411
01:18:58.701 --> 01:19:01.670
Heart by Fabio for surviving Glover's destroying them.

1412
01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:06.940
Glover in the next round he fucks around and drops his hands and it looks like,

1413
01:19:08.300 --> 01:19:12.190
it looks like Fabio is just a dead man.
Fabio uncork says,
left talking,

1414
01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:13.640
catches him perfect on the chin.

1415
01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:18.260
Glover's legs go like rubber and he's like Recia for to hang on.
It's like,
whoa.

1416
01:19:18.410 --> 01:19:22.550
Like the fight completely changed with one punch.
Yeah,
that can happen.

1417
01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:24.250
First of all,
you're not wearing gloves basically.

1418
01:19:24.251 --> 01:19:28.040
You're really not wearing gloves and I'm not a punch like that.
One mistake.

1419
01:19:28.041 --> 01:19:30.860
One error.
That's why MMA to me is so fascinating.

1420
01:19:30.861 --> 01:19:32.780
That's why I just love watching it so much.
Well,

1421
01:19:32.781 --> 01:19:37.280
did you ever see the Mike Russell Todd Duffy fine?
Um,
I don't think so.

1422
01:19:37.310 --> 01:19:40.580
Greatest One punch comeback in the history of sports.
No doubt about it.

1423
01:19:40.820 --> 01:19:45.170
Todd Duffy is built like a dude who was created in a lab.
I mean,

1424
01:19:45.171 --> 01:19:48.350
he's unbelievably athletic.
Just come up.
Let me see.

1425
01:19:48.380 --> 01:19:50.450
Just a ridiculous physical specimen.

1426
01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:53.810
I mean Todd Duffy's though fucking stud.
Okay.

1427
01:19:53.811 --> 01:19:57.890
And he is fighting this Guy Mike Russo,
who's a cop,
a Chicago cop,

1428
01:19:57.891 --> 01:19:59.330
active duty cop.
Okay.

1429
01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:03.740
Maybe one of the toughest human beings on the planet because Todd is hitting

1430
01:20:03.741 --> 01:20:06.890
this motherfucker with everything but the kitchen sink and you're talking about

1431
01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:11.900
Todd who was a 240 pounds shredded man and he moves like a cat and he is on

1432
01:20:13.400 --> 01:20:17.400
Corkin bombs on Russel,
right.
For three rounds.

1433
01:20:17.401 --> 01:20:20.670
This goes on and somehow another Russel survives with a broken arm.

1434
01:20:20.671 --> 01:20:25.410
This is the Kakais.
Yeah.
His left arm is broken and he hits Mike de hits,

1435
01:20:25.411 --> 01:20:30.270
Todd Duffy with one punch and drop some Qaddafi's unconscious with one punch

1436
01:20:30.330 --> 01:20:32.890
fall.
Look at Duffy follows up and changed,

1437
01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:37.800
drops a hammer fist on him with his broken hand.
The shame about his body.

1438
01:20:37.801 --> 01:20:40.560
I mean,
why don't you share the American man from Atlantis,
Patrick then?

1439
01:20:41.070 --> 01:20:45.630
Is that his cousin?
You saw a bald spot in my head,
I just,
hello?
Yeah,

1440
01:20:45.631 --> 01:20:48.300
he's gigantic man.
He's so this,
this,

1441
01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:53.220
this guy and in middle of nowhere and corks is one punch and turns the whole

1442
01:20:53.221 --> 01:20:55.830
fight around like that that can happen in any other sport.

1443
01:20:55.831 --> 01:20:57.030
And that's right when we look at his chin,

1444
01:20:57.031 --> 01:20:58.890
that dude looks like he takes a vicious beating.

1445
01:20:59.790 --> 01:21:01.980
So the fact that that can happen in the third round,

1446
01:21:01.981 --> 01:21:05.910
even when the guy was built like that,
he just one with Todd Duffy,
just one.

1447
01:21:05.970 --> 01:21:09.570
He um,
he looked fucking sensational.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1448
01:21:09.571 --> 01:21:11.100
He fought it out and he's been good for a while.

1449
01:21:11.101 --> 01:21:14.860
I've seen the kid fight a couple of times.
He fought.
Um,
uh,

1450
01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:18.180
this dude filled the Freese who's a really good Jujitsu guy and he,
uh,

1451
01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:21.140
he knocked him out.
He looked awesome.
It's amazing how the first fight back off.

1452
01:21:21.141 --> 01:21:23.580
See,
it's amazing how it's all so much evolved.

1453
01:21:23.581 --> 01:21:26.700
It's that you cannot just be a Jujitsu guy.
You can't just be a boxer.

1454
01:21:26.701 --> 01:21:27.960
You got to be everything.
Yeah.

1455
01:21:27.961 --> 01:21:31.650
There's not a lot of room for a one dimensional fighter always changing.

1456
01:21:31.651 --> 01:21:34.470
I was thinking about Jon Jones and Jon Jones has got to worry about Cain

1457
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:38.100
Valasquez eventually.
Right.
I mean,
that's the fight for me.
That's the fight.
Well,

1458
01:21:38.101 --> 01:21:40.400
I think cane,
um,
and um,

1459
01:21:40.530 --> 01:21:44.820
Daniel Cormier as well because core Mba is going to probably wind up going down

1460
01:21:44.821 --> 01:21:45.654
to two o five,

1461
01:21:45.940 --> 01:21:50.940
call me a is a one had heavyweight one the strike force Grand Prix beat Josh

1462
01:21:52.470 --> 01:21:56.530
Barnett,
which is gigantic.
All this me as he long,
no,
it's short,
right?

1463
01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:59.940
I think he's five 11.
Hard to fight when you're five 11 fight and Jon Jones,

1464
01:21:59.970 --> 01:22:04.630
I don't know,
man.
That's,
it's very difficult to fight 82 in charms.
Well,

1465
01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:09.000
he definitely has a nice advantage.
It's not just John Jones,
his arms,
his legs,

1466
01:22:09.240 --> 01:22:11.820
and I always talk about like this,
this reach thing that we do.

1467
01:22:11.821 --> 01:22:14.580
We will measure the reach,
but we took it from boxing.

1468
01:22:14.820 --> 01:22:18.810
We need to incorporate like leg length,
fuck,
because like a guy like John,

1469
01:22:18.811 --> 01:22:22.230
a big part of his game is kicking you and he kicks you from a place where you

1470
01:22:22.231 --> 01:22:23.011
can't even touch,

1471
01:22:23.011 --> 01:22:26.070
especially when he's pushed kicking and doing those like sidekicks,

1472
01:22:27.060 --> 01:22:31.200
they hurt and he throws that sidekick to the thigh end of the body and he fucked

1473
01:22:31.201 --> 01:22:34.620
Vitara up with that thing.
Right?
He dropped him to the body with that.
Yeah.

1474
01:22:34.621 --> 01:22:37.470
That's a hard guy to get up.
But Cormier is a monster.

1475
01:22:37.800 --> 01:22:40.710
If he can be healthy and strong at two oh five,
first of all,

1476
01:22:40.711 --> 01:22:45.660
he's wrestling world fucking class.
I mean,
he was in the Olympics,
he had to,

1477
01:22:45.690 --> 01:22:50.030
but he had an issue where he,
uh,
tried to cut weight incorrectly to,
um,

1478
01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:53.670
to rest.
I think I wrestled at two oh six.
And,
uh,
he had kidney failure,

1479
01:22:54.090 --> 01:22:56.310
so he's gotta be real careful about the way it cuts.

1480
01:22:56.430 --> 01:22:59.670
If he's going to go down to a five it's gotta be a legit lifestyle change.

1481
01:22:59.700 --> 01:23:02.700
It can't be him getting silly and you know,

1482
01:23:02.701 --> 01:23:06.130
and trying to like dehydrated 40 pounds in two.
And Yeah,
with a lot of guys

1483
01:23:06.130 --> 01:23:08.270
<v 3>do that,
man.
A lot of guys do that and they are,</v>

1484
01:23:08.271 --> 01:23:12.420
they are really rolling ground or whatever.
I mean,
that guy does it.

1485
01:23:12.510 --> 01:23:16.240
He walks around at one 90 or something.
Right.
He's big.
He's a big thick,

1486
01:23:16.241 --> 01:23:19.300
muscular dude.
You know,
there's a lot of those cowboy,

1487
01:23:19.301 --> 01:23:20.560
I'm sorry I haven't talked to her at school,

1488
01:23:20.561 --> 01:23:24.670
but at Cabo was probably when I saw him at one point he was one 91 or something

1489
01:23:24.671 --> 01:23:28.510
like that.
He sucks down to 55 he's a big dude.
Yeah,
he's a,

1490
01:23:28.520 --> 01:23:32.650
he's tall and long too,
you know,
but he makes it no problem.

1491
01:23:32.651 --> 01:23:36.850
And he can go for three rounds hard at 55 so he's not,

1492
01:23:37.060 --> 01:23:39.850
whatever he's doing,
he can,
you know,
he can keep doing that.

1493
01:23:40.150 --> 01:23:42.550
It's like Benson Henderson,
same thing.
The champ,

1494
01:23:42.580 --> 01:23:44.650
he loses quite a bit of weight as well,

1495
01:23:44.651 --> 01:23:49.030
but he's very healthy and disciplined and now he does it.
So the results are,

1496
01:23:49.060 --> 01:23:52.240
you know,
when,
when he's actually in the octagon,
he can go five rounds.

1497
01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:55.570
No problem.
By the way,
I guess what I'm having on my podcast who?

1498
01:23:55.630 --> 01:23:58.630
Sugar Ray Leonard.
Ooh,
that's interesting.
Brian Callen show.

1499
01:23:58.930 --> 01:24:02.320
Thank you Joe or Brian Challenge and not,
not,
not,
not man thoughts anymore.

1500
01:24:02.560 --> 01:24:06.820
It's called,
it's called fucking the Brian Council.
I was like,
you know what,

1501
01:24:06.940 --> 01:24:09.810
this man thought things.
It's not that sustainable.
I'm not really having me.

1502
01:24:09.820 --> 01:24:13.690
I said a fucking weird,
and it was given to me by my all,
I love my manager,

1503
01:24:13.870 --> 01:24:16.660
but I was like,
I don't know.
It's just a little too contrived.

1504
01:24:16.661 --> 01:24:17.710
I can't be contrived.

1505
01:24:17.711 --> 01:24:20.950
It's gotta be just Brian Collins can't ever listen to your managers when they

1506
01:24:20.951 --> 01:24:24.300
told him he's kind of shit,
but you need to tell you a creative things.

1507
01:24:24.301 --> 01:24:25.134
You've got to go.
Thanks.

1508
01:24:25.690 --> 01:24:28.720
Sit well with me where I feel like I'm trying to pull one over on.

1509
01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:31.630
I'm fans like where I'm like,
it's called man thoughts.
I'll be able to brand it.

1510
01:24:31.870 --> 01:24:35.890
I'll be able to have my t shirts.
It will be the men's store man thoughts class.

1511
01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:37.540
What did you,
we'll call it before that.

1512
01:24:37.541 --> 01:24:40.920
And you call it something else to Bryan County jail for that.
Nope.
Sorry.

1513
01:24:41.410 --> 01:24:44.580
I called you and I was like,
maybe I should call it the questions with Brian Cow.

1514
01:24:44.581 --> 01:24:48.730
And you're like,
and I was trying to come up with a format for it,

1515
01:24:48.731 --> 01:24:53.170
but I've been having fun just having conversations.
I keep the 20 hours,

1516
01:24:53.171 --> 01:24:56.800
the skeptic tank.
I'm like,
what is the,
you're not really,
I don't know,

1517
01:24:56.810 --> 01:25:00.320
cause I'm not,
I wish I was specific.
I'm too fucking all over the place,
but I'm,

1518
01:25:00.321 --> 01:25:02.300
I'm excited about.
What do you think I should ask?
Sure.
Ray.

1519
01:25:02.301 --> 01:25:06.550
I got a lot of questions.
Just talk to them.
Yeah,
that's a good question.

1520
01:25:06.910 --> 01:25:10.490
What's your favorite bubble gum?
What's his,
what's his toughest fight?
You know,

1521
01:25:10.750 --> 01:25:13.210
you'll,
you'll have some good conversations with them,
I'm sure.
Yeah,

1522
01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:16.210
don't worry about it.
But,
but the good thing is that you're all over the place.

1523
01:25:16.211 --> 01:25:19.270
That's a good thing.
Yeah.
I mean,
it makes these conversations so varied.

1524
01:25:19.290 --> 01:25:21.320
That's what people love.
You know?
They don't want you.

1525
01:25:21.321 --> 01:25:24.160
If you were only like a history guy and they were only talking about Chinese

1526
01:25:24.170 --> 01:25:25.810
history,
you know what I mean?
How many,

1527
01:25:25.870 --> 01:25:28.840
how many podcasts on history can you list for you?
Like,

1528
01:25:28.841 --> 01:25:30.600
do you guys talk about Stinky Posey and never?

1529
01:25:31.090 --> 01:25:35.660
Is there a stinky pussy conversations to be had?
Apparently Eddie Bravo,

1530
01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:39.520
last one I told you he went on that whole stinky pussy,
dirty feet,
stinky foot.

1531
01:25:39.580 --> 01:25:43.360
He has one of the greatest stinky pussy,
stinky feet stories ever.

1532
01:25:43.950 --> 01:25:47.230
But having sex with a stripper in a backseat of a car when she had a yeast

1533
01:25:47.231 --> 01:25:50.050
infection and her feet stunk.
Could you pin stripping all night?

1534
01:25:50.060 --> 01:25:54.880
What's funny about that?
It doesn't stop a man.
You know,
you're like,
fuck it.

1535
01:25:54.881 --> 01:25:57.940
Let me just hold my breath.
How many times you're bang grown,
you smell shit.

1536
01:25:57.970 --> 01:25:59.980
You smell her,
but it's like she didn't wipe it.

1537
01:25:59.981 --> 01:26:03.350
Well fuck down and you can see like a little bit of shit that's happened me,

1538
01:26:03.530 --> 01:26:07.970
it's happened to me.
And guess what?
Didn't,
didn't affect my heart on one one bit.

1539
01:26:08.570 --> 01:26:09.640
That can be pretty gross though.

1540
01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:13.970
I still have a vision of this like little Dab of Shit that I saw at my

1541
01:26:13.971 --> 01:26:18.150
girlfriend's ass when I was like 21 that's a huge,
because I remember it.

1542
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:20.960
<v 2>You know what happened to me?
You know what happened to me?</v>

1543
01:26:21.770 --> 01:26:26.770
I was in New York City and I remember like meeting this girl sexy and then we

1544
01:26:30.021 --> 01:26:34.430
were making out and then we've had sex and then I turned her over and she had a

1545
01:26:34.431 --> 01:26:39.431
hairy ass and I'm talking about thick black hair and I was like all over us.

1546
01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:44.600
It was all of her cheeks.
It was thin,
but you know it was,
it was there and then,

1547
01:26:44.601 --> 01:26:49.010
and then she had a real real hair and see the old cracker row and I was like,

1548
01:26:49.011 --> 01:26:53.600
this is like fucking a guy and I couldn't fucking do it.

1549
01:26:53.630 --> 01:26:56.450
I just was like my eye that just came to me.

1550
01:26:56.480 --> 01:26:58.030
<v 3>How have you thought about that in a long time?</v>

1551
01:26:58.031 --> 01:27:01.760
How was she on the one who knows a seven for the story?

1552
01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:06.490
<v 2>Yeah,
until she turned over.
And then she was a guy and that made her,
you know,</v>

1553
01:27:06.550 --> 01:27:10.600
not tend to track that made her 10.
Wow.
So what did she say when you,

1554
01:27:10.630 --> 01:27:14.050
I didn't say a goddamn thing.
No.
What did she say when you just sort of stopped?

1555
01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:17.380
I don't know.
I can't remember.
I just remembered this story.

1556
01:27:17.740 --> 01:27:20.050
So if I said I'd been making it up,
but I know me,

1557
01:27:20.051 --> 01:27:22.480
I know I probably did the old Ah,

1558
01:27:22.481 --> 01:27:25.990
my fucking storm or on this condoms burning my dick.

1559
01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:29.980
I'm bad with latex.
I had something like that.
This,
I gotta get Outta here.

1560
01:27:30.010 --> 01:27:33.880
I gotta get her to think I'm gonna throw up,
I guess.
I think a poison.

1561
01:27:33.881 --> 01:27:36.490
I have somebody poisoned me.
Look,

1562
01:27:36.491 --> 01:27:39.910
there's been some people that have been thinking about poison,
hairy ass.

1563
01:27:40.190 --> 01:27:44.170
Hairy ass.
What in your fucking mind?
How about looking in the mirror?

1564
01:27:44.171 --> 01:27:48.160
Sometimes you've got to check the backside.
Well,
you are my,

1565
01:27:48.310 --> 01:27:51.940
<v 3>so you remember back in the high school days where no one ever,</v>

1566
01:27:52.010 --> 01:27:55.240
she took care of their pussy.
Nobody's,
no one shares.
Get these malls.

1567
01:27:55.600 --> 01:27:58.560
And by the way,
I didn't care.
Porn changed that,
right?

1568
01:27:59.500 --> 01:28:03.370
For all women because women didn't shave their pussies back then.

1569
01:28:03.620 --> 01:28:07.780
Every of women shave their pussy.
I mean,
I don't think it's all women.

1570
01:28:07.900 --> 01:28:12.160
I think some women are like feminist holdouts.
They like,
you know,
like,

1571
01:28:12.161 --> 01:28:15.040
I don't feel like I should,
you know,
any girls getting laid is,

1572
01:28:15.050 --> 01:28:18.700
is shaped one central.
There's a lot of girls out there with a hairy box.

1573
01:28:18.701 --> 01:28:23.170
Let's just say general things and dudes who just deal with it,
just take it.

1574
01:28:23.980 --> 01:28:26.920
If it's not too bad,
like what if she has naturally not that much hair,

1575
01:28:27.370 --> 01:28:31.540
not that bad,
like Norwegian or some shit.
It's fine from Iceland.

1576
01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:36.490
Tiny thin white hairs.
It's firely shit.
But if she's Greek,
she's a girl.

1577
01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:40.360
She's Italian Greek letter.
They're so beautiful.
You ever been to Greece?

1578
01:28:40.361 --> 01:28:44.260
I've lived there.
Lived there for three years.
Did you really?
Yeah,
in Athens.

1579
01:28:44.380 --> 01:28:47.160
And then I went to the islands.
I remember the Algebra one taste.

1580
01:28:47.470 --> 01:28:52.370
My Dad was working there.
But um,
when my,
uh,
well I went to,
uh,

1581
01:28:52.490 --> 01:28:54.760
I went,
I was in fourth,
fifth and sixth grade.

1582
01:28:54.770 --> 01:28:57.590
And in Greece you can live then all the time.
Not really,

1583
01:28:58.450 --> 01:29:02.130
but I went back to the islands and I went to Mykonos

1584
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:07.130
<v 2>I remember and I was 21 or 2120 and it was the one of the greatest trips of my</v>

1585
01:29:07.711 --> 01:29:09.300
life and I've never seen,

1586
01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:13.960
I've never seen more beautiful women in my life really in my life because they

1587
01:29:13.961 --> 01:29:18.770
were Italian,
French,
Vegas and I've been to Vegas.
Yes.

1588
01:29:19.440 --> 01:29:22.830
Yes.
Wow.
What thing is by the way is underrated.

1589
01:29:22.831 --> 01:29:24.750
Vegas has some of the best looking woman you'll ever say.

1590
01:29:24.780 --> 01:29:26.520
Well they're not really,
they're coming from all over the world.

1591
01:29:26.521 --> 01:29:29.220
True as what it is like a center point for attention.

1592
01:29:32.310 --> 01:29:36.130
We're getting Ooh,
glitzy shit.
Yeah.

1593
01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:36.691
<v 1>I went there.</v>

1594
01:29:36.691 --> 01:29:40.230
When I go to Vegas I played pool like easily cause the one of the last places

1595
01:29:40.231 --> 01:29:44.100
where you can play pool 24 hours a day.
Wow.
Yeah.
Vegas has 24 hour pools.

1596
01:29:44.190 --> 01:29:47.130
Those don't really exist in most parts of the world.
Right.
They're done.

1597
01:29:47.220 --> 01:29:49.860
It's over.
New York used to have a gang of them.
La had one.

1598
01:29:50.310 --> 01:29:54.000
They the last time we had one in La was the La Earthquake.
Just for pleasure.

1599
01:29:54.001 --> 01:29:58.050
It's always more work.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Really?
Yeah.
I don't gamble,

1600
01:29:58.710 --> 01:30:02.200
you know.
So I've gone to Vegas for fights back in the day four.

1601
01:30:02.220 --> 01:30:05.370
I used to work for the UFC.
Yeah.
Well that's right.
Where did we go?

1602
01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:09.570
What do we go to see?
Those was before I was working for them.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1603
01:30:10.410 --> 01:30:11.850
Back in the day.

1604
01:30:12.910 --> 01:30:15.370
<v 2>I remember you and I go into one.
We went to one in baton rouge,</v>

1605
01:30:15.371 --> 01:30:19.930
Louisiana when a guy named Randy couture had had his first fight,
I think.
Yeah.

1606
01:30:20.350 --> 01:30:22.380
And uh,
and I remember we went,
I went,
well,

1607
01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:25.660
you and I were at the one where Randy couture beat Vito Belfort.

1608
01:30:26.230 --> 01:30:31.000
Remember that if you taught was like back then,
that was a few Toros,
240 pounds.

1609
01:30:31.050 --> 01:30:32.710
He was how he just putting some,
uh,

1610
01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:36.790
one of lucky charms in the cereal every morning.
Fucking,
I mean,

1611
01:30:36.970 --> 01:30:40.240
here's this guy who was size eight feet to 40.

1612
01:30:40.410 --> 01:30:45.310
They looked like a color of a plum.
Nick was like a lion.
He's,
yeah,

1613
01:30:46.570 --> 01:30:50.260
he's a stud.
But then his,
I guess his trainer,
uh,
who was 34 years old,

1614
01:30:50.261 --> 01:30:51.760
died of a heart attack.
I think,

1615
01:30:51.820 --> 01:30:56.780
<v 1>okay,
well it was this big giant bodybuilding dude that he's to hang around with.</v>

1616
01:30:56.781 --> 01:30:57.140
Yeah.

1617
01:30:57.140 --> 01:31:00.500
We used to call them garden hoses because you had these arms and with veins that

1618
01:31:00.501 --> 01:31:03.830
look like garden hoses.
Yeah.
It was unbelievable.
I look to them,
you're like,

1619
01:31:03.940 --> 01:31:05.450
how has that a human who's so

1620
01:31:05.550 --> 01:31:10.550
<v 2>big crazy and he was probably helping get Victoria could be get bodybuilder big.</v>

1621
01:31:12.310 --> 01:31:14.290
<v 1>Well,
it's interesting,
um,
the,
uh,</v>

1622
01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:18.430
the whole debate on a performance enhancing drugs and testosterone and stuff

1623
01:31:18.431 --> 01:31:20.100
like that.
What's really interesting about it is it's,

1624
01:31:20.250 --> 01:31:23.950
it's jumped the fence into the women's division now,
cause you know,

1625
01:31:23.951 --> 01:31:26.720
Ronda Rousey is the woman's champ.
They,

1626
01:31:27.010 --> 01:31:29.260
they opened up 135 pounds for women now.

1627
01:31:29.261 --> 01:31:32.680
So she's going to headline the first ever woman's like,

1628
01:31:32.740 --> 01:31:35.850
well first woman's fight is going to headline a UFC and a,

1629
01:31:35.880 --> 01:31:39.730
it's going to be an Anaheim.
And at one 35 is where she's the champ.

1630
01:31:39.731 --> 01:31:44.230
But at one 45 was that cyborg chick,
the one who's built like a dude,

1631
01:31:44.830 --> 01:31:46.680
but she got popped for steroids.
Yeah.

1632
01:31:47.050 --> 01:31:50.770
So now that trying to see if they can get Cyborg to drop to one 35 but she's

1633
01:31:50.771 --> 01:31:52.600
like,
I can make one 35

1634
01:31:52.930 --> 01:31:56.890
<v 2>where is she from?
Brazil.
Yeah.
I don't like the,</v>

1635
01:31:56.891 --> 01:31:59.560
I don't like that fight for Ronda Rousey first of all because I love Rousey

1636
01:31:59.561 --> 01:31:59.980
because I have

1637
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:03.160
<v 3>a huge crush on Ronda Rousey.
Jay Moore,
I did his podcast.
He's like,</v>

1638
01:32:03.340 --> 01:32:05.860
well if you were dating her,
how would you date somebody you know,

1639
01:32:05.861 --> 01:32:06.760
could kick your ass.
Like,
oh,

1640
01:32:06.761 --> 01:32:10.270
I would train every single day and in a year or two years I'd figure her out and

1641
01:32:10.271 --> 01:32:13.210
I'm still 170 pound man and we'd have our,
we'd have,

1642
01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:17.500
I would be just fine on the mat as far even as great as she is.
As a guy.

1643
01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:21.720
I'll take the beating because I love her.
She could tap you right now.
Yes.

1644
01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:23.590
I don't train.
I haven't enrolled,

1645
01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:28.090
but Ronda Rousey as we walk out there living with that.
That's why I'm training.

1646
01:32:28.091 --> 01:32:32.830
That's why I just bought a bunch of mats.
You joking me.
Of course.
But,
but,
uh,
but,

1647
01:32:32.860 --> 01:32:35.200
uh,
I gave that ghost up a long time ago.
I mean,

1648
01:32:35.201 --> 01:32:37.700
I just knew I was never going to be,
you know,
but,
but a female,

1649
01:32:37.900 --> 01:32:40.090
I just got too many friends who were fighting to see what they can do to me and

1650
01:32:40.110 --> 01:32:42.940
yeah.
And I'm not going to be,
I'm not going to be in the,
I,
I could never even,

1651
01:32:42.970 --> 01:32:46.090
even Rhonda to me is so pretty.
I wouldn't ever want to punch her in the face.

1652
01:32:46.091 --> 01:32:49.090
She's just too hot to me.
Yeah.
And I love her.

1653
01:32:49.150 --> 01:32:52.510
She pay you back while you're sleeping?
She'd kicked my foot.
Yeah,
that's right.

1654
01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:55.600
You couldn't,
if you cheated on her or something,
I'd be so fucking high.
He did.

1655
01:32:55.601 --> 01:32:59.860
You'd have to be really worried about it.
Should break your arm.
Yeah.
But,
uh,

1656
01:32:59.890 --> 01:33:03.190
she's,
she had like three different chicks.
Are She dating anybody?
Me.

1657
01:33:03.310 --> 01:33:05.760
She takes another one,
I think is adorable.
She's to me,

1658
01:33:05.770 --> 01:33:09.280
she's got a boyfriend who's an MMA fight.
I am Bryan Caraway.
Really cool guy.

1659
01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:13.570
Yeah.
He was on the ultimate,
how's she doing?
How's her arm?
It was fun.
Yeah.
Yeah.

1660
01:33:13.571 --> 01:33:17.500
She's back.
I don't like seeing girls hurt each other.
I hate that shit.
Well,

1661
01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:21.940
you know where is going to do it too?
She's the armbar assassin.

1662
01:33:21.970 --> 01:33:24.230
She just goes for armbars.
It's hard to protect the guy.

1663
01:33:24.231 --> 01:33:26.920
It's hard to get an arm bar against the high level black belts to,
well,

1664
01:33:26.921 --> 01:33:28.090
when she was a little girl,

1665
01:33:28.140 --> 01:33:31.750
you know her mother raised her and her mother raised her to be a judo champion.

1666
01:33:31.751 --> 01:33:33.520
Her mother was a judo champion,
which she was a little girl.

1667
01:33:33.521 --> 01:33:36.760
She would wake her up and make her do armbars.
Wow.

1668
01:33:36.761 --> 01:33:38.860
Wake her up like casual Arbella here,
go get it.

1669
01:33:38.890 --> 01:33:42.100
And she would like throw her hips up and throw it like,
wow.

1670
01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:45.970
She's been doing it since she was a baby.
She's a baby.

1671
01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:49.870
There's like a fluidity in efficiency when someone is really fucking good at

1672
01:33:49.871 --> 01:33:53.740
some point that that she has like when she swings her legs over for that Shit,

1673
01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:58.390
she's done that 100 million times.
She just whipped 10,000 hours.

1674
01:33:58.630 --> 01:34:01.390
10,000 hours.
Yeah.
There's certain moves,
man.
It's really funny,

1675
01:34:01.391 --> 01:34:04.240
but the way you can relate it is tying your shoes.

1676
01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:06.790
You know how you tie your shoes,
you don't think about tying your shoes,

1677
01:34:06.791 --> 01:34:08.770
you don't think,
well,
I going to have been this.
I'm going over,

1678
01:34:08.771 --> 01:34:11.050
loop it with that and then I'm going to go through that.

1679
01:34:11.140 --> 01:34:13.800
You don't think about it.
You just go like that and your shoes are tie.
Yeah.

1680
01:34:13.930 --> 01:34:17.880
Well that's what happens with fighting to that same thing.
Yeah.
When you find,

1681
01:34:17.890 --> 01:34:20.910
even if you've been wrestling and somebody grabs you,
I moved to the side,
I'll,

1682
01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:22.490
I'll be working your arm.
You know,

1683
01:34:22.491 --> 01:34:26.830
you just kind of have a reaction to and with especially a lot of people have

1684
01:34:26.831 --> 01:34:29.560
like pet moves,
you know,
they have this one move.

1685
01:34:29.561 --> 01:34:32.650
They could just hit it like Joe Lowe's on,
just see the last Jolo was on flight.

1686
01:34:32.780 --> 01:34:36.970
He's got that crazy,
he'll hook,
had kid's a stud.
He's a tough kid,
man.

1687
01:34:36.971 --> 01:34:40.600
It's very tough.
But,
but uh,
um,
so it was Miller.
Miller is a fucking savage.

1688
01:34:40.930 --> 01:34:44.050
That was tough.
That was his best fight to date.
I mean,
unbelievable.

1689
01:34:44.051 --> 01:34:48.010
Unbelievable fight.
He is as tough as it gets.
It's below sack and forth.

1690
01:34:48.011 --> 01:34:51.160
It was crazy.
It was a complete insanity.
What a fight.

1691
01:34:51.700 --> 01:34:54.610
There's so many killers in these divisions that being a fighter is so fucking

1692
01:34:54.611 --> 01:34:55.061
difficult.

1693
01:34:55.061 --> 01:34:59.270
But one of the GSP does is I think that makes him so good is he'll find out

1694
01:34:59.271 --> 01:35:02.540
where your strength isn't just w and just not,
not engaged.
That strength,

1695
01:35:02.610 --> 01:35:06.120
you know?
Yeah.
And do things that you don't expect.
Yeah.
He'll,
he'll,

1696
01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:09.080
well he's so good at mixing up the takedowns and the,

1697
01:35:09.290 --> 01:35:11.480
he's gonna fight next to as,
and that's going to be a tough one for him.

1698
01:35:11.910 --> 01:35:14.960
It's going to be exciting.
You should come.
I will.
Cause I had Nick Diaz,

1699
01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:19.910
I love water comes in Montreal.
I would,

I yes,

1700
01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:23.690

I've got to make sure I'm not doing a Gig.
It's a,

1701
01:35:23.780 --> 01:35:25.790
I think it's like March 15th or some shit.

1702
01:35:26.980 --> 01:35:31.420
March 16th March 16th in Montreal.
If you want it,

1703
01:35:31.421 --> 01:35:34.830
you could do a Gig with me the night before.
You know what?
Yeah,

1704
01:35:34.831 --> 01:35:39.500

1705
01:35:39.501 --> 01:35:41.330
If by March,
March,

what is it?

1706
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:46.280
March 16th and we could do a theater together on the 15th dude,
that's great.

1707
01:35:46.281 --> 01:35:49.850
Okay.
I'm quite sure I'm free.
Yeah.
All right.
You and me,
there'll be fun.

1708
01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:50.840
I love it.
Okay,

1709
01:35:50.841 --> 01:35:53.570
we're going to book something cause I was just going to book a comedy club

1710
01:35:53.630 --> 01:35:54.380
because I have a,

1711
01:35:54.380 --> 01:35:57.050
I have to give these people a whole lot of new material cause I was just in

1712
01:35:57.051 --> 01:36:00.860
Montreal recently but he'll just forced me to write.
We'll have some fun.

1713
01:36:00.890 --> 01:36:03.320
Montreal is great.
Just say Eddie F's on the show tonight.

1714
01:36:03.800 --> 01:36:07.500
Also Eddie's on the ice house shot.
Beautiful tickets at ice house.

1715
01:36:07.590 --> 01:36:09.940
One interrupt us and talking about something about yourself in the middle of us.

1716
01:36:09.941 --> 01:36:12.620
Tone.
Yes.
Yes.
The 10 minute podcast.

1717
01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:17.700
Oh three we're in top three comedies of 2012 so listen you in top three new

1718
01:36:18.570 --> 01:36:21.500
comedies to have three new comedies in 2012 which was really cool.

1719
01:36:21.501 --> 01:36:26.120
I was awesome man.
Was it good?
And I'm,
I'm coming up on our hundredth episode.

1720
01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:28.030
How often you guys do it,
do you know?

1721
01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:32.300
We meet every two weeks and a whole bunch of them.
And then who puts them out?
Oh,

1722
01:36:32.330 --> 01:36:35.000
well Sasa.
So he added some and everything.
Yeah,
edits.
He does it all.

1723
01:36:35.001 --> 01:36:39.290
He's a nut really.
And he's,
he's just fucking hilarious.

1724
01:36:39.320 --> 01:36:42.350
And all of them are 10 minutes long.
Yeah.
I think will Sasso to me,

1725
01:36:42.430 --> 01:36:46.500
and I'm not bullshitting.
I think he's truly the most,
he's the,
the,

1726
01:36:46.820 --> 01:36:51.350
the most talented actor,
comedian and all around talent I've ever,

1727
01:36:51.351 --> 01:36:55.550
I've ever been around.
I've never seen anybody sing.
He can dance.

1728
01:36:55.580 --> 01:36:59.400
He can fucking depression there.
I don't need to see you saying.
Right.

1729
01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:01.010
Well that's what I mean.
But nobody,

1730
01:37:01.100 --> 01:37:05.060
she can do basically everything and nobody knows it.
Like if the world,

1731
01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:08.300
it's just this business,
but he's as good.
He could do anything.

1732
01:37:08.301 --> 01:37:12.670
Anybody out there can do and as well or better in building.
Damn,

1733
01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:18.950
dude,
he's,
he's sick.
Daniel Day Lewis.
You think he can,
he can do it.

1734
01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:23.000
I think if you gave will and you gave will a role,
he had to be grading.

1735
01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:27.080
I think he would win an Oscar.
I think he's,
I think he is giving love.

1736
01:37:27.110 --> 01:37:28.520
I think he's Oscar caliber.

1737
01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:32.300
I've actually honestly never seen anybody that talented I and he does shit.

1738
01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:36.140
He does shit out of nowhere on the podcast.
It's a fucking way better than me.

1739
01:37:36.790 --> 01:37:38.110
You're having a lot of man thoughts.

1740
01:37:38.900 --> 01:37:41.300
So he'll do shit like out of the blue on the podcast where I go,

1741
01:37:41.301 --> 01:37:44.030
how the fuck is he doing this?
How was he coming up with this?
It kills me.

1742
01:37:44.570 --> 01:37:49.040
He's amazing.
Do you guys know about this whole Al Jazeera current TV thing?
No,

1743
01:37:49.070 --> 01:37:53.750
it's really fascinating.
Uh,
current TV,
which is Al Gore's network.

1744
01:37:54.170 --> 01:37:57.110
He just sold that to Al Jazeera.
No.

1745
01:37:57.240 --> 01:38:02.240
So now al Jazeera has access to millions of US viewers.

1746
01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:04.590
It's really kind of fascinating.

1747
01:38:04.620 --> 01:38:08.270
And I think time Warner drop them or Cox cable dropped them.

1748
01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:12.780
I shouldn't speak out of school.
So let me Google language in media wars.
Yeah.

1749
01:38:12.810 --> 01:38:15.030
Cox Drops Al Zero drops.

1750
01:38:15.230 --> 01:38:20.230
What's his name is Morgan Stanley by The Washington Post recently.

1751
01:38:20.340 --> 01:38:25.340
Jamie diamond who did Jamie diamond of Morgan Stanley and Morgan Stanley bought.

1752
01:38:26.910 --> 01:38:30.960
Really?
Yeah.
Can you look that up?
Time Warner dropped current TV.

1753
01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:36.330
So Time Warner cable drop them because Al Jazeera bought them.

1754
01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:41.010
That's fascinating.
Meanwhile,
I'll just,
zero has good fucking news.

1755
01:38:41.011 --> 01:38:44.820
I listen to Al Jazeera there.
They seem to have pretty unbiased news,

1756
01:38:45.360 --> 01:38:48.390
which is something that American we can fucking use.
Yes,
we could.

1757
01:38:48.391 --> 01:38:49.540
Well the problem is that it,

1758
01:38:49.610 --> 01:38:54.150
like we always talk about it really does seem like not only a corporations at

1759
01:38:54.180 --> 01:38:56.980
corporate interests had never been a corporate corporate powers,

1760
01:38:57.010 --> 01:38:58.200
never been so concentrated.

1761
01:38:58.410 --> 01:39:02.760
Campbell soup controls 70% of all the shelf space for a soup,

1762
01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:04.290
a Colgate,
Palmolive,

1763
01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:09.500
I believe control 83% of all the soap and toothpaste you buy a corps.

1764
01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:14.310
Uh,
and then Heizer Bush are the distributors of all beer.

1765
01:39:14.610 --> 01:39:18.570
And so they,
they have such power and concentrations of,

1766
01:39:18.571 --> 01:39:21.030
of money and power that it,

1767
01:39:21.060 --> 01:39:26.060
it's very easy to manipulate government to give yourself an advantage in the

1768
01:39:26.401 --> 01:39:29.790
market.
And that goes along with news as well.
Yeah.
And that's a whole,

1769
01:39:29.791 --> 01:39:32.190
I hope that's not happening with news,
but it seems it is.

1770
01:39:32.220 --> 01:39:36.310
Oh well it's been for awhile line with Fox News being complete.

1771
01:39:36.311 --> 01:39:41.040
That's leaning.
I mean that's,
that's,
that's a threat to our democracy.

1772
01:39:41.041 --> 01:39:44.940
I was watching Fox News when they were joking around about like,

1773
01:39:45.090 --> 01:39:46.520
can we get rid of the president?

1774
01:39:46.570 --> 01:39:49.500
You like say this was right after the election and they will like,

1775
01:39:49.501 --> 01:39:51.090
someone said something and someone said,
well,

1776
01:39:51.091 --> 01:39:55.800
can we send the president over there too?
Oh,
like God,
I don't think we can.

1777
01:39:57.030 --> 01:39:59.820
But it was like,
it's supposed to be news.
It's supposed to be unbiased.
Exactly.

1778
01:39:59.821 --> 01:40:01.230
It's not just supposed to be news,

1779
01:40:01.231 --> 01:40:06.231
but the w what they're joking around about is not really even funny or a joke.

1780
01:40:07.110 --> 01:40:12.110
And what they're doing is just letting everyone know that much like you,

1781
01:40:12.810 --> 01:40:16.550
we are upset with this,
win this victory.
Right?

1782
01:40:16.830 --> 01:40:21.830
Because the victory of Obama does not go along with the programming of this

1783
01:40:21.931 --> 01:40:26.550
network.
Well,
by the,
by the way,
networks now news program networks,

1784
01:40:26.551 --> 01:40:29.910
that famous story was in the 70s when the good news that came in and said 60

1785
01:40:29.911 --> 01:40:33.870
minutes for the first time got really high ratings,
bad news for the first time.

1786
01:40:33.871 --> 01:40:35.670
I got high ratings.
In other words,

1787
01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:38.220
news has now become something you can tell advertising on.

1788
01:40:38.250 --> 01:40:42.540
Never shouldn't be the case.
And in fact,
uh,
news has now become entertainment.

1789
01:40:42.570 --> 01:40:46.650
You also have a channel called CNN or Fox that has to fill content with a lot of

1790
01:40:46.651 --> 01:40:50.370
stuff over,
you know,
24 hours.
Then again,
what's the,
what's the option?

1791
01:40:50.371 --> 01:40:53.890
The option is like PBS,
which sucks a fat Dick.
The option,

1792
01:40:53.950 --> 01:40:55.580
I don't know the honest I do.

1793
01:40:55.600 --> 01:40:57.930
I do think it's up to consumers and I think it's up.

1794
01:40:58.500 --> 01:41:01.150
I think it's up to just educating yourself.
I love it here,

1795
01:41:01.180 --> 01:41:02.013
but it's up to educators.

1796
01:41:02.050 --> 01:41:03.700
<v 1>Stop it.
You don't love NPR.</v>

1797
01:41:03.701 --> 01:41:07.960
There's a lot of NPR that is filled with people who talk like this.
This is NPR.

1798
01:41:07.961 --> 01:41:11.980
We don't have emotions.
We don't have feelings.
We're just giving you the facts.

1799
01:41:12.220 --> 01:41:16.030
We are live from Afghanistan where his so what?
Right now it's not,

1800
01:41:16.090 --> 01:41:20.200
there's nothing about NPR that's exciting cause they don't have to compete.

1801
01:41:20.230 --> 01:41:21.750
So they're not interesting.
They're not entertainer.

1802
01:41:21.790 --> 01:41:26.170
I listened for as listen just because they got interesting perspectives.

1803
01:41:26.171 --> 01:41:27.910
Are Authors and stuff like that on?
Well,

1804
01:41:27.911 --> 01:41:32.810
they're allowed to do things because it's,
you know,
it's sort of public,

1805
01:41:33.070 --> 01:41:36.040
public funded.
They can get away with things that you can't get away with it.

1806
01:41:36.041 --> 01:41:36.720
You're competing in

1807
01:41:36.720 --> 01:41:39.630
<v 3>public market.
Well they can get into segments like in depth and stuff.</v>

1808
01:41:39.631 --> 01:41:41.730
A lot of times what you're,
what you,
you know,
these,

1809
01:41:41.731 --> 01:41:45.390
these news programs have to keep everything in a chunk because they have to cut

1810
01:41:45.391 --> 01:41:47.970
the advertising.
So you get bumper sticker,
you know,

1811
01:41:47.971 --> 01:41:52.470
very kind of periphery ideas of what's really going on on the ground.
Uh,
and,

1812
01:41:52.471 --> 01:41:54.210
and I don't think it's the best way to get your news.

1813
01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:59.300
<v 1>Well it's also what national public radio does is so boring and they interject</v>

1814
01:41:59.390 --> 01:42:04.130
all these ads,
these pledge drives and shit and that,
yeah,
that,
that's,

1815
01:42:04.280 --> 01:42:08.240
that's the only four times a year.
But it doesn't matter when it happens.

1816
01:42:08.241 --> 01:42:10.790
Like they need to go podcast style.

1817
01:42:10.820 --> 01:42:13.610
That's what they should've done a podcast of the answer to all that shit because

1818
01:42:13.611 --> 01:42:15.650
there's no way you can have a conversation with someone.
They're like,

1819
01:42:15.651 --> 01:42:17.130
we're doing in any other format.
Right.

1820
01:42:17.170 --> 01:42:21.080
It's no way you can have a three hour open ended conversation cause they don't

1821
01:42:21.081 --> 01:42:25.520
exist.
Right.
They fucked it up with this.
You okay over there?

1822
01:42:26.000 --> 01:42:30.830
Do you just try and make noise?
The um,
they,
they fucked it up with,

1823
01:42:31.010 --> 01:42:33.760
you know,
with being boring and they fucked it up with their,

1824
01:42:33.761 --> 01:42:36.380
their pledge drives that make your brain bleed.

1825
01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:40.730
There's a fucking Terence Mckenna interview and I swear to God,
this guy,

1826
01:42:40.731 --> 01:42:43.280
every five minutes interrupts transplant.
Kevin says,

1827
01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:46.160
and if you're enjoying this conversation with Terrence,

1828
01:42:46.310 --> 01:42:48.350
this is one of the things that we offer here.

1829
01:42:48.500 --> 01:42:52.490
And if you could just donate some of,
I mean we,
we this,
these,
we may not be,

1830
01:42:53.180 --> 01:42:56.600
<v 3>that's better than having advertisement every time you have it.
No,
it's not.
No,</v>

1831
01:42:56.601 --> 01:42:59.290
it's not.
No,
it's not every five minutes.
This fucking Douche bag.

1832
01:42:59.550 --> 01:43:03.340
That's literally as a week out of every four months.
I mean,

1833
01:43:03.410 --> 01:43:06.710
I don't know if that's the case in this guy with this one.

1834
01:43:07.130 --> 01:43:11.510
Radio shows hold up members,
so I know Barf,
right?
Interviews.

1835
01:43:11.511 --> 01:43:12.890
Terry Gross always has something.

1836
01:43:12.891 --> 01:43:17.480
Somebody in [inaudible] of course you give them 50 bucks a month.

1837
01:43:17.950 --> 01:43:21.530
Do they do,
they should be able to delete those stupid pledge drives from you.

1838
01:43:21.620 --> 01:43:25.690
You should be able to press up.
Well,
they,
I have a lot of power.
And recently my,

1839
01:43:25.700 --> 01:43:27.680
my new decision is not a,
now I don't have,

1840
01:43:27.681 --> 01:43:30.500
I try not to have an opinion unless I've read at least two books on something

1841
01:43:31.400 --> 01:43:33.680
like now.
Um,
and even when you read a book,
it's so funny.

1842
01:43:33.690 --> 01:43:36.950
Everything I mentioned to you,
Republic loss,
Lawrence less book,

1843
01:43:36.980 --> 01:43:39.950
I'm trying to get him my fucking podcast.
He's so fucking smart,

1844
01:43:40.310 --> 01:43:41.720
but he just talks about the only issue,

1845
01:43:41.780 --> 01:43:43.880
the only issue we should be talking about is money in politics.
Right?

1846
01:43:44.090 --> 01:43:47.360
And all donations should be anonymous.
Entity has got different ideas about it,

1847
01:43:47.361 --> 01:43:48.140
but,
but,

1848
01:43:48.140 --> 01:43:50.650
but he just makes a really good case of all the stuff that we talk about,

1849
01:43:50.660 --> 01:43:52.160
about of corporate power,

1850
01:43:52.160 --> 01:43:54.020
<v 2>about what money does when you're a congressman,</v>

1851
01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:56.420
it's not about being a Democrat or Republican,

1852
01:43:56.421 --> 01:44:00.680
you spend all your time basically raising money to get elected again and just

1853
01:44:00.681 --> 01:44:01.820
kind of what it does and stuff.

1854
01:44:01.821 --> 01:44:06.050
But I just find that so many issues that you try to get into like this gun issue

1855
01:44:06.051 --> 01:44:09.420
and stuff like that,
they're fucking complicated and,

1856
01:44:09.430 --> 01:44:13.190
and trying to really earn an opinion takes a lot of investigation.

1857
01:44:13.191 --> 01:44:16.760
A lot of times I don't have time to do it.
And there's so many ways.

1858
01:44:16.790 --> 01:44:21.240
There's so many different perspectives,
perspectives to look.
I,
you know,
alarms.

1859
01:44:21.550 --> 01:44:23.010
<v 1>Sam Harris wrote a very,
uh,</v>

1860
01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:25.570
interesting and really well thought out piece about it.

1861
01:44:25.571 --> 01:44:29.500
If you go to Sam's webpage,
I think it's Sam Harris.
Dot Org.
Uh,
you can,
uh,

1862
01:44:29.530 --> 01:44:33.370
you can download it and read it,
but it made some really good points about guns.

1863
01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:36.190
Yeah.
Well about the whole issue.
You know,
what we're dealing with.

1864
01:44:36.240 --> 01:44:39.600
<v 2>Well,
Nicholas Christoff had a really interesting article that I kind of got,</v>

1865
01:44:39.601 --> 01:44:42.290
got my attention where in Australia in 1982,

1866
01:44:42.291 --> 01:44:43.470
forgive me if I'm getting the dates wrong.

1867
01:44:43.471 --> 01:44:48.120
1984 to 96 in 1,996 and 12 years,

1868
01:44:48.121 --> 01:44:50.100
they had,
um,
uh,

1869
01:44:50.101 --> 01:44:54.480
I think 16 or 19 mass shootings accommodating with 35 people being killed in one

1870
01:44:54.481 --> 01:44:55.620
time in [inaudible] 96.

1871
01:44:55.621 --> 01:44:58.560
It was a huge thing in Australia and they passed I believe,

1872
01:44:58.561 --> 01:45:02.430
three different measures.
One was a 28 day waiting period.

1873
01:45:02.431 --> 01:45:05.700
I think another was the type of weapon you can actually get.

1874
01:45:05.880 --> 01:45:10.530
And then they bought back 650,000 guns.
And by the way,

1875
01:45:10.531 --> 01:45:12.130
everybody,
I'm paraphrasing the article,

1876
01:45:12.180 --> 01:45:15.430
I don't know if that's exactly what it was.
Three of those majors since then,

1877
01:45:15.431 --> 01:45:17.970
they've had no,
no mass.
It had no mass shootings.

1878
01:45:18.180 --> 01:45:21.060
I'm just saying when I hear that,
I go,
the only thing as I say is I go,

1879
01:45:21.061 --> 01:45:22.020
I don't know if that's the answer.

1880
01:45:22.020 --> 01:45:24.780
I just say that I don't like when the NRA says,
well,

1881
01:45:24.810 --> 01:45:27.860
there's nothing we can do about crazies.
Yeah,
there is that.

1882
01:45:27.861 --> 01:45:29.430
There's gotta be a way to solve this problem.

1883
01:45:29.431 --> 01:45:31.800
I don't feel like having my kid not be safe at school.
I,

1884
01:45:31.820 --> 01:45:34.500
there's gotta be something.
There's a discussion to be had about,

1885
01:45:34.650 --> 01:45:36.520
we already have caps on lethality.

1886
01:45:36.521 --> 01:45:39.690
You can't buy a fully automatic machine gun unless you have a really intricate

1887
01:45:39.691 --> 01:45:41.010
license and go to a lot of the stuff.

1888
01:45:41.011 --> 01:45:44.370
You can't actually carry a gun out in the open unless you're in Arizona.

1889
01:45:44.371 --> 01:45:48.860
And even that's difficult,
right?
We do have laws on the books.
Is,

1890
01:45:48.861 --> 01:45:53.400
is there,
is there a discussion to be had about,
you know,

1891
01:45:53.940 --> 01:45:58.080
I dunno,
I find I'm very careful with this cause I just don't fucking know

1892
01:45:58.500 --> 01:46:00.020
<v 1>God,
there's a real issue though.</v>

1893
01:46:00.570 --> 01:46:01.950
I mean what's what we were talking about earlier,

1894
01:46:01.951 --> 01:46:05.330
there's a real issue that people have one side or the other.
You know,

1895
01:46:05.370 --> 01:46:09.930
I've seen so many tweets that were like,
well,
too bad if you,
if you,
uh,

1896
01:46:09.950 --> 01:46:11.910
if you like hunting,
get a new hobby.

1897
01:46:12.200 --> 01:46:15.240
Like I actually saw that somebody wrote that.
Fuck,
people having guns.

1898
01:46:15.270 --> 01:46:17.850
If you like hunting,
get a new hobby.
Like that's,

1899
01:46:17.910 --> 01:46:20.700
that kind of stupidity exists too.
There's,
there's,

1900
01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:25.790
there's one side that doesn't want to give at all and the sales side,

1901
01:46:25.791 --> 01:46:29.310
it doesn't want to give.
Right.
All.
And somewhere along the line,
again,

1902
01:46:29.311 --> 01:46:33.300
like I said,
the real issue is mistaken and overlooked.

1903
01:46:33.301 --> 01:46:36.390
And that issue is what the fuck is happening to people.

1904
01:46:36.391 --> 01:46:38.610
That it's allowing them to do that.
Right?
What is,

1905
01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:42.960
what is allowing someone to completely lose their humanity because it doesn't

1906
01:46:42.990 --> 01:46:44.700
just have to be a gun.
You know,

1907
01:46:45.270 --> 01:46:49.480
Timothy Mcveigh did it with fertilizer guy did it in China.
22 kids with,

1908
01:46:49.530 --> 01:46:50.340
with a knife.

1909
01:46:50.340 --> 01:46:52.960
<v 3>Yeah.
You could,
you,
there's a lot of ways you could kill people.
Yeah.</v>

1910
01:46:53.010 --> 01:46:57.960
Did you hear about these assholes in Indiana that a blue their house up and

1911
01:46:57.961 --> 01:47:02.400
killed their neighbors?
No.
Yeah,
it's fascinating cooking math.
No,
no,
no.
The,
the,

1912
01:47:02.460 --> 01:47:05.360
an insurance scam.
They,
um,

1913
01:47:05.400 --> 01:47:08.880
they took out all their important paperwork and uh,
some,

1914
01:47:08.910 --> 01:47:13.910
some valuables and then they opened up the valves of the gas that goes to the

1915
01:47:14.431 --> 01:47:16.410
stove and the gas that goes to the fireplace.

1916
01:47:16.590 --> 01:47:19.230
And then they set the timer on the microwave.

1917
01:47:19.590 --> 01:47:22.680
So that timer on the microwave went off at a very specific time.

1918
01:47:22.710 --> 01:47:26.490
And when it sparks,
I don't know if they put like metal in it or something.

1919
01:47:26.550 --> 01:47:28.040
I guess that's what you do.
Um,

1920
01:47:28.140 --> 01:47:32.140
it just blew the house to Smithereens and blew the neighbor's house to

1921
01:47:32.141 --> 01:47:36.960
smithereens to kill the neighbors.
Crazy fucking assholes.

1922
01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:40.560
And by the way,
they didn't think they could figure this stuff out.
Well,

1923
01:47:40.650 --> 01:47:45.650
these dump fucks left the gas on for hours before the microwave went off.

1924
01:47:46.141 --> 01:47:49.140
So you're talking about a giant cloud of,
oh,

1925
01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:53.880
we'll just wide open gas being pumped into this spot.
All the doors shut,

1926
01:47:54.030 --> 01:47:57.570
all the windows sealed.
It was like a gas balloon in there.

1927
01:47:57.810 --> 01:47:59.820
And so when that bomb went off,
I mean,

1928
01:47:59.821 --> 01:48:03.960
you're talking about it obliterated the house.
It's unbelievable.

1929
01:48:03.961 --> 01:48:07.470
So I talked about it yesterday and the podcast and somebody put a link up to the

1930
01:48:07.471 --> 01:48:12.300
actual story that they,
actual stories,
mindblowing,
killed names to fuck heads.

1931
01:48:12.330 --> 01:48:16.980
Yeah.
So they're in jail now for murder.
And that workout,
that insurance scam,

1932
01:48:17.220 --> 01:48:20.550
some people really fuck up.
It must be such a surreal thing to be like,

1933
01:48:20.551 --> 01:48:23.850
I wanted to make some money and now I'm going to be in jail for the rest of my

1934
01:48:23.851 --> 01:48:27.100
life.
You know what?
They were doing a lot in California.
They were getting uh,

1935
01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:29.380
people and they would slam the brakes on in front of them.

1936
01:48:29.820 --> 01:48:31.950
People would slam in them and they said,
oh my neck.

1937
01:48:32.130 --> 01:48:35.250
And they were suing insurance companies.
There was like super common.

1938
01:48:35.310 --> 01:48:37.650
The other thing they were doing is they'd come in and get some obscure,

1939
01:48:37.660 --> 01:48:41.130
you'd have a business mom and pop shop and they would sue you based on some

1940
01:48:41.131 --> 01:48:43.380
weird obscure law and then get you to settle out of court.

1941
01:48:43.800 --> 01:48:47.850
Have you ever seen a video of people faking falls?
Yes.
That's beautiful.

1942
01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:49.740
I've seen some of those markets.

1943
01:48:51.700 --> 01:48:55.050
You're on fucking video dumped down.
It's hilarious.

1944
01:48:55.980 --> 01:48:57.210
They didn't know.
You know,

1945
01:48:57.211 --> 01:49:00.150
people didn't know how much shit was videotaped until they tried a few of those.

1946
01:49:00.170 --> 01:49:04.860
Last thing that I noticed now in my life in 2013 everywhere you go,

1947
01:49:04.861 --> 01:49:08.850
they're watching you.
Everywhere you go,
hotels,
anywhere you go,

1948
01:49:08.851 --> 01:49:10.950
you're being watched.
Yeah.
Traffic.

1949
01:49:11.400 --> 01:49:15.330
It's just interesting in some ways makes you safer in another way.
It's like,

1950
01:49:15.331 --> 01:49:18.540
you know,
as long as it's not one central hub and one group of people watching,

1951
01:49:18.710 --> 01:49:20.490
it's a lot of different people watching af fuck it.

1952
01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:23.940
It's a lot of different people watching,
but who gets to,

1953
01:49:23.970 --> 01:49:28.680
who gets to decide what gets watched?
Cops get this list.
Cops.
Yeah,

1954
01:49:28.681 --> 01:49:29.880
the cops will.

1955
01:49:29.881 --> 01:49:34.260
Obama just signed a very controversial bill that was five more years of

1956
01:49:34.261 --> 01:49:38.880
warrantless wiretapping so that the feds are allowed to just beside it,

1957
01:49:38.881 --> 01:49:43.050
listen to it on your phone calls anytime they want.
Like how did that happen?

1958
01:49:43.530 --> 01:49:47.680
No warrants like are the judges of that fucking visit idea?
Is that yeah,

1959
01:49:47.681 --> 01:49:50.080
that that takes a long time.
You've got to go through all these channels.

1960
01:49:50.081 --> 01:49:51.940
Sometimes they need access immediately.

1961
01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:55.990
Cops have been proven over and over again to have issues and be corrupt.

1962
01:49:55.990 --> 01:49:58.810
Especially costings.
What if a cop like,
like the girl,

1963
01:49:58.870 --> 01:50:01.660
if you're trying to solve a problem,
shit,
trying to solve a problem,

1964
01:50:01.661 --> 01:50:04.390
you're going to fucking do.
You get like,
it's like the deer.

1965
01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:05.770
I was supposed to shoot a buck.

1966
01:50:05.830 --> 01:50:07.660
Then we were on the other side where you could show a dope.

1967
01:50:07.661 --> 01:50:10.120
I was like I'm not gonna shoot a doe.
Not on camera.
That is fucking,

1968
01:50:10.121 --> 01:50:12.020
I had three hours the guy,
cause you want to shoot a dog,

1969
01:50:12.220 --> 01:50:15.670
I'll fucking shoot anything.
I asked you to human in a deer suit.
Just let me,

1970
01:50:15.671 --> 01:50:17.980
let me open fire on this pocket thing.
You know,
you,

1971
01:50:17.981 --> 01:50:20.680
you get an objective and you're going to bend the rules.
You know,

1972
01:50:20.740 --> 01:50:24.010
that's super common with cops.
I mean the planting evidence,
planting,

1973
01:50:24.030 --> 01:50:28.870
God's got to this.
There's gotta be a way that you could figure out how,
you know,

1974
01:50:28.871 --> 01:50:30.640
if someone's telling the truth.
And right now there's not,

1975
01:50:31.180 --> 01:50:33.370
and since there isn't there,
you know,

1976
01:50:33.430 --> 01:50:37.270
people can fuck with things and Ben things and how things are going to take

1977
01:50:37.271 --> 01:50:42.130
their,
they're going to,
I can lie detector test or are inadmissible.
Yeah,

1978
01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:44.830
it does.
You don't have to take them.
And if you do take them,

1979
01:50:44.831 --> 01:50:47.380
they don't count in court.
So it's not even,
it doesn't matter.

1980
01:50:47.381 --> 01:50:48.620
You can't even bring it up.
Right?

1981
01:50:48.650 --> 01:50:51.220
Like you don't even think you're allowed to bring up polygraphs.
Well,

1982
01:50:51.221 --> 01:50:54.850
because they don't work on sociopathy stay really calm.

1983
01:50:55.060 --> 01:50:59.650
They had done lying to them.
Is that because lying is about,
about,
you know,

1984
01:50:59.740 --> 01:51:02.470
basically not looking good in front of somebody.

1985
01:51:02.471 --> 01:51:03.850
You're trying to hide something and you're,

1986
01:51:03.851 --> 01:51:06.610
their approval means something to you.
So she'll pass.
Don't have that.

1987
01:51:06.950 --> 01:51:10.440
That's why they can stay so calm under pressure.
That's creepy.

1988
01:51:10.441 --> 01:51:13.000
And it just so fucking calm with Bernie Madoff.

1989
01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.850
There were saying that after it was over,
like he didn't give a fuck.

1990
01:51:16.270 --> 01:51:19.180
He was always like,
I want to,
I need orange juice,
orange juice.

1991
01:51:19.540 --> 01:51:21.640
Like little like you do realize what the fuck just happened.

1992
01:51:22.100 --> 01:51:25.240
You just rob people of billions of dollars.
You crushed people's dreams.

1993
01:51:25.360 --> 01:51:28.700
People committing suicide,
including your son.
Yeah.
I need owner there.

1994
01:51:28.701 --> 01:51:32.770
Our shoes here.
Like it was just what he had in his mind,

1995
01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:36.990
what he wanted to such a back.
Apparently his wife slipped away.
She's,

1996
01:51:37.450 --> 01:51:40.780
his wife apparently slipped away with some money to,
well she couldn't,

1997
01:51:40.900 --> 01:51:43.300
I don't think she could even get her nails done where she was living.

1998
01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:46.300
So not where she was living.
She had to go to another spot.

1999
01:51:46.301 --> 01:51:49.020
But that bit's moved to Beverly Hills.
No one's going to know who she is.
No,

2000
01:51:49.030 --> 01:51:51.740
change your last name.
Gives a fuck around.
There we go.
Fly early.

2001
01:51:51.820 --> 01:51:54.140
Hells in some ways it's the worst place in the planet I've ever been to.

2002
01:51:54.540 --> 01:51:58.930
In what way?
I've never seen creepier looking people in my life.

2003
01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:02.350
I've never seen.
Uh,
I just find it just,

2004
01:52:02.440 --> 01:52:05.190
I went to Barney's because there was a sale for it.

2005
01:52:05.191 --> 01:52:07.870
That's my first mistake because I'm going to buy clothes and her bike clothes.

2006
01:52:07.871 --> 01:52:09.190
I wear t shirts and jeans.
I'm like,

2007
01:52:09.191 --> 01:52:11.850
I'm going to go by when you worked fancy shoes.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

2008
01:52:11.860 --> 01:52:16.150
I try zippers on the side of them,
like my Nike phrase right now and I go,

2009
01:52:16.151 --> 01:52:17.650
yes I do.
By the way,
I was like,

2010
01:52:17.651 --> 01:52:21.130
I'm going to buy some boots with a zipper on the side and this is the year I

2011
01:52:21.131 --> 01:52:23.860
wear a leather shirt jacket and by the way,

2012
01:52:23.861 --> 01:52:28.861
I'm going to get some cashmere zipper hoodie sweater cashmere cause they are

2013
01:52:28.931 --> 01:52:31.450
soft and they're sexy,
blah blah,
blah.

2014
01:52:31.690 --> 01:52:34.330
Fucking didn't buy anything because I have no patients.
I get there,
I'm like,

2015
01:52:34.331 --> 01:52:36.550
I can't try the shit on.
I'm exhausted.

2016
01:52:36.940 --> 01:52:41.020
And meanwhile it's just that you just see these,
these fucking dudes who,

2017
01:52:41.021 --> 01:52:45.100
who've never done a pushup,
but they're spending a fortune $700 on shoes.

2018
01:52:45.110 --> 01:52:46.340
They don't have the scaffolding.

2019
01:52:46.340 --> 01:52:51.110
<v 2>Their bodies are all soft and Shitty from chasing that dream and climbing that</v>

2020
01:52:51.111 --> 01:52:53.090
wall that they don't even want to be on top of.

2021
01:52:53.300 --> 01:52:56.270
And now they've got money to buy awesome threads in there,

2022
01:52:56.271 --> 01:53:00.350
46 years old and they got that great convertible and they're going to pick up

2023
01:53:00.351 --> 01:53:03.520
chicks tonight but they got to where?
Bucking ostrich skin boots and,

2024
01:53:03.860 --> 01:53:08.770
and you know,
felt a felt hat with a fucking scarf by Air Mez.

2025
01:53:09.060 --> 01:53:10.820
And you just want to be like,
dude,
just end it.

2026
01:53:10.821 --> 01:53:14.290
Jump out that window right now cause he'd be presence is depressing.
Mish.

2027
01:53:14.510 --> 01:53:17.180
Oh yeah.
Oh fuck yeah.
Hey listen,

2028
01:53:17.181 --> 01:53:22.010
I walk around with $30,000 on my body peasant.
No,
not for me.

2029
01:53:22.170 --> 01:53:26.310
Yeah,
it's a weird thing,
isn't it?
The showing all the wardrobe,
like the,

2030
01:53:26.350 --> 01:53:31.250
the wealth showing the wealth of my buddy told me he spent $140 on a haircut.

2031
01:53:31.250 --> 01:53:33.800
I remember,
I never forgot this.
He got to spend 140 bucks on a haircut too.

2032
01:53:33.801 --> 01:53:36.650
But I feel it's worth it.
I was like,
I'm not friends with you anymore.

2033
01:53:36.651 --> 01:53:39.200
How's that sound?
I just on principle can't hang out with you.

2034
01:53:39.260 --> 01:53:43.010
He said he feels it's worth it.
Yeah,
they really,
they really layered it though.

2035
01:53:43.011 --> 01:53:45.830
They knew how to what?
What do you think of my hair?
He was like dead serious.

2036
01:53:45.831 --> 01:53:48.380
What do you think of my hair?
I was like,
how about I punch you in the face?

2037
01:53:48.381 --> 01:53:51.680
What do you think we're right hand you fucking idiot.
Well,

2038
01:53:51.681 --> 01:53:53.750
this is something that is very east coast,

2039
01:53:53.751 --> 01:53:57.970
especially where they just don't tolerate preening.
No,
you don't fucking,

2040
01:53:57.980 --> 01:54:00.650
that's that is correct,
sir.
I told you when I shut up with my,

2041
01:54:00.680 --> 01:54:04.910
my leather fucking awesome leather pants from France and you want the leather

2042
01:54:04.911 --> 01:54:08.240
belts.
I was in fucking France and as this,

2043
01:54:08.241 --> 01:54:12.420
this hot sales woman had me try on a leather jacket and she goes,

2044
01:54:12.421 --> 01:54:15.330
sits [inaudible].
And he said,
it's really good.
I go,
oh,

2045
01:54:15.370 --> 01:54:18.650
Mixi Buku and then she goes,
you know,
we have a really Newton news.

2046
01:54:18.651 --> 01:54:22.640
I've owned two,
but [inaudible] booked was that,
I was like,
okay,
so pants.

2047
01:54:22.690 --> 01:54:27.690
Should I put on chocolate suede leather pants dude and hold wait for it.

2048
01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:31.670
Bought a pair of boots that went with them.
Meanwhile,

2049
01:54:31.820 --> 01:54:34.490
I go boots that go with that.
That's,
that's exactly right.

2050
01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:37.930
I literally shut my buddy's like,
what the fuck?
I come out of the,

2051
01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:40.310
my friends are watching hockey.
They turn around and go,
fuck,

2052
01:54:40.311 --> 01:54:43.280
has he gotten his legs?
I go,
no,
I got these.
These are leather pants.

2053
01:54:43.610 --> 01:54:46.820
They jumped on me as a group without even a signal and pulled them off and throw

2054
01:54:46.821 --> 01:54:47.654
them out the window.

2055
01:54:47.960 --> 01:54:52.960
That was the last time I ever fucking saw my $300 pair of leather pants,

2056
01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:56.840
and that's one of the good things about being on the east coast,
you know?
Fuck.

2057
01:54:56.841 --> 01:54:59.050
Yet.
It's one of the good things about being on the east coast as you,

2058
01:54:59.060 --> 01:55:02.920
there's a lot of shit that they get away with an la that you just could do it.

2059
01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:06.680
I showed up the first time I saw Jimmy Burke when I got home after mad TV,

2060
01:55:06.830 --> 01:55:10.100
I decided to wear a fucking hat.
I'm a hat guy now,

2061
01:55:10.101 --> 01:55:14.490
apparently because I'm on TV in La.
It was a fucking Kangol hat.

2062
01:55:15.260 --> 01:55:17.720
No,
but I had it turned around backwards.
And you know,
it doesn't look bad.

2063
01:55:17.721 --> 01:55:20.360
It's just that it's not me.
I'm not that guy.
I never wear hats.

2064
01:55:20.361 --> 01:55:23.570
And Jimmy knew it was suddenly,
oh,
I'm going to wear fucking a hat.

2065
01:55:23.780 --> 01:55:28.010
And I had an awesome like awesome shirt that I bought with like cool design.

2066
01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:30.110
Jimmy could see right away.
I walk in,
he goes,
dude,

2067
01:55:30.111 --> 01:55:33.410
it's so fucking good to see you,
man.
I can't.
I'm so proud of you.

2068
01:55:33.411 --> 01:55:37.190
Take the fucking hat off for right now.
I'm gonna slap the Shit Outta here.

2069
01:55:38.390 --> 01:55:39.680
Like did he didn't miss a beat.

2070
01:55:39.740 --> 01:55:43.110
We missed up Jimmy Burke's introduction to the world.
We got them too high,

2071
01:55:43.260 --> 01:55:44.040
too high,
and he didn't

2072
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:45.470
<v 1>know what the fuck the deal.
Didn't know what dude,</v>

2073
01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:48.120
he passed out in the car on the way back.
Yeah.

2074
01:55:48.300 --> 01:55:50.040
Why don't you guys try to go deep with us.

2075
01:55:50.100 --> 01:55:52.410
They don't know what the fuck they're getting into.
We've got to get back.

2076
01:55:52.411 --> 01:55:52.930
We'll get it back.

2077
01:55:52.930 --> 01:55:57.390
So if you're not a regular marijuana smoker or if you're smoking marijuana from

2078
01:55:57.391 --> 01:55:58.620
other parts of the country,

2079
01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:01.680
especially if you're smoking marijuana from a place that doesn't have a medical

2080
01:56:01.681 --> 01:56:04.620
marijuana program,
the odds of you getting like really good stuff,

2081
01:56:04.830 --> 01:56:07.320
they drop significantly.
He hadn't slept,

2082
01:56:07.321 --> 01:56:09.210
he hadn't eaten and he doesn't smoke a lot of weed.

2083
01:56:09.211 --> 01:56:12.450
I smoke your weed one time when I was a high for seven hours.
How about that?

2084
01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:15.660
That's,
that's a good,
that's a good batch.
That's how it's supposed to be.

2085
01:56:16.170 --> 01:56:20.910
Why would you want some fucking shit?
I'm still fucking high.
I've had two meals.

2086
01:56:20.911 --> 01:56:24.360
You're like,
that's how he rolls on.
That's not helpful.

2087
01:56:25.260 --> 01:56:28.350
It's got to go there and stop being such a control freak.
Right?

2088
01:56:30.500 --> 01:56:35.160
Hey,
thanks Linda Goldman.
So people were asking me when you guys went hunting,

2089
01:56:35.190 --> 01:56:40.170
did you guys smoke weed out there?
No,
you don't need,
we'd like,

2090
01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:43.410
you know,
people that think that you need,
we'd always to have a good time.

2091
01:56:43.411 --> 01:56:46.260
They're just a silly is that people think you don't need weed to have a good

2092
01:56:46.261 --> 01:56:49.830
time.
Like you know,
you don't,
I want to go shoot hogs.
Anything.

2093
01:56:49.920 --> 01:56:54.120
I want to go shoot hogs and northern California.
Well Dude,
we could do that too.

2094
01:56:54.350 --> 01:56:58.710
All right.
We can,
you know,
we could definitely shoot pigs.
They're wild pigs are,

2095
01:56:59.290 --> 01:57:03.630
there's a season,
the,
it's 24 hours a day,
seven days a week,

2096
01:57:03.631 --> 01:57:07.710
all year round.
Especially in Texas.
In Texas.
You could shoot them at night.

2097
01:57:08.220 --> 01:57:11.970
You put flashlights on them and blast them can see.
You could trap them in Texas.

2098
01:57:11.971 --> 01:57:14.790
You could shoot them from helicopters.
You can do whatever the fuck you want.

2099
01:57:14.791 --> 01:57:18.420
You can drive in your truck,
roll down the window and shoot them out the window.

2100
01:57:19.040 --> 01:57:19.873
Yeah.

2101
01:57:22.590 --> 01:57:27.300
They opened up a new highway in Texas and the first night for people ran into

2102
01:57:27.301 --> 01:57:31.380
pigs with their call and the first night for accidents.

2103
01:57:31.530 --> 01:57:34.650
That was a huge,
huge,
two 5,300 easy,

2104
01:57:34.890 --> 01:57:38.280
no problems and just slamming into them at 80 miles an hour.

2105
01:57:38.750 --> 01:57:43.650
1200 pounds or something.
Yeah,
the really well Hogzilla if you've seen Hogzilla.

2106
01:57:43.740 --> 01:57:48.510
I don't know how much that fucker.
I think that's probably more than what it was.

2107
01:57:48.540 --> 01:57:52.650
I think it was a feral pay.
A pig will go feral in the wild in like three weeks,

2108
01:57:53.010 --> 01:57:56.430
in three weeks,
three weeks.
I thought it was three generations knew.

2109
01:57:56.460 --> 01:57:57.900
Three weeks in three.

2110
01:57:58.010 --> 01:58:02.880
They're the one of the only animals that physically morphs when it's removed

2111
01:58:02.881 --> 01:58:05.430
from domestication,
something happens to them.

2112
01:58:05.431 --> 01:58:09.360
When we're feeding them and we're taking care of them and we keep them in a pen,

2113
01:58:09.361 --> 01:58:12.750
they stay like white and pink.
When they get out in the wild,

2114
01:58:12.751 --> 01:58:15.720
their hair changes within three weeks,
it starts to happen.

2115
01:58:15.900 --> 01:58:20.130
Their hair starts to change,
their tusks grow and their nose extends.
It's crazy.

2116
01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:23.900
Wow.
They'd completely become a different angle.
I think there also are,

2117
01:58:23.901 --> 01:58:26.280
aren't in northern California.
They have some,
they have,

2118
01:58:26.310 --> 01:58:27.550
what are we going to be hot and we're not going be,

2119
01:58:27.551 --> 01:58:31.050
we're gonna be having a Russian.
Well they,
there's that,
there's that as well.

2120
01:58:31.080 --> 01:58:34.350
Russian wild boars.
Um,
they,
they introduced those,

2121
01:58:34.410 --> 01:58:38.190
but they also started interbreeding with pigs and that's some of the larger
ones.

2122
01:58:38.191 --> 01:58:40.860
Some of the larger wild pigs that you find are hybrids.

2123
01:58:41.170 --> 01:58:42.340
And they said that was about,

2124
01:58:42.720 --> 01:58:46.690
<v 3>um,
Hogzilla was one of those,
how do we find them in northern California?</v>

2125
01:58:46.691 --> 01:58:49.420
Did you have to,
Ella was telling us that,
um,

2126
01:58:49.450 --> 01:58:53.530
there was a place that he has a friend that has a ranch and they show up every

2127
01:58:53.530 --> 01:58:54.640
morning at the,
at the river,

2128
01:58:54.760 --> 01:58:57.040
you know that there's a river that runs through the ranch and all you do is you

2129
01:58:57.041 --> 01:58:59.950
get there in the morning and you go by the river or your weight or creek,

2130
01:58:59.951 --> 01:59:02.890
whatever the fuck it is.
The pig show up and you blast one.

2131
01:59:02.891 --> 01:59:04.930
That'd be a short hunting trip though.
So what,

2132
01:59:05.380 --> 01:59:09.580
it's not an entity like doing it all day.
How about fun?
But we were fine.

2133
01:59:09.610 --> 01:59:12.190
We were so fucking called the first night,
second night,

2134
01:59:12.370 --> 01:59:14.680
and we were sleeping in tents.
Take,

2135
01:59:14.740 --> 01:59:19.030
you're taking dumps outside and he's thing sucks eating that shitty food.
And I,

2136
01:59:19.300 --> 01:59:23.950
we're both freezing.
I just here I can jump off camping alone.

2137
01:59:24.330 --> 01:59:27.400
Yeah.
We talked about this before.
The first night we did it,

2138
01:59:27.401 --> 01:59:30.490
the first night we got there,
it was pouring rain and was like,
wow,

2139
01:59:30.520 --> 01:59:33.460
what did we get into five days of this,

2140
01:59:33.670 --> 01:59:37.000
five days of being just freezing your ass off,
getting rained on.

2141
01:59:37.390 --> 01:59:40.680
He'll fucking fun.
Yeah.
Well that's why people do it.
You know?

2142
01:59:40.690 --> 01:59:43.990
I always wondered like,
why aren't we allowed that?
That seems like fucking gross.

2143
01:59:43.991 --> 01:59:44.360
There's no,

2144
01:59:44.360 --> 01:59:48.370
I have such a respect now for not only hunting but also the animals that was

2145
01:59:48.371 --> 01:59:50.320
haunting and and for the land.

2146
01:59:50.321 --> 01:59:54.790
You cannot be a good hunter the way those guys hunt and not actually have a deep

2147
01:59:54.791 --> 01:59:56.500
love.
I would argue that guys like Ryan,

2148
01:59:56.501 --> 02:00:01.150
our guide and Rinella have a much deeper love and certainly I've way deeper

2149
02:00:01.151 --> 02:00:02.470
understanding of animals,

2150
02:00:02.471 --> 02:00:06.660
animal behavior than anybody who doesn't hunt any Vegan.
Well you have,
I dunno,

2151
02:00:06.990 --> 02:00:08.260
I'd say more.
You know,

2152
02:00:08.261 --> 02:00:12.100
I'd say they definitely have a big love of it and a great appreciation for it.

2153
02:00:12.101 --> 02:00:15.100
I don't know what other people have what appreciation of Vegan house or,

2154
02:00:15.101 --> 02:00:17.390
I mean everybody's individual.
I don't think you can really generalize.

2155
02:00:17.580 --> 02:00:21.160
It requires a great deal of respect and,
and doesn't necessarily,
there's,

2156
02:00:21.161 --> 02:00:22.840
that's why Yahoo is go hunting too.

2157
02:00:22.870 --> 02:00:25.400
There's a lot of crazy fucks and go out there and they get hammered and shoot

2158
02:00:25.600 --> 02:00:28.390
that.
We did what we did.
I was impressed with how much we knew.

2159
02:00:28.480 --> 02:00:30.910
What we did is called a fair chase hunt,
you know,

2160
02:00:30.911 --> 02:00:34.960
but there's people in Texas that has high rate,
high fence,
high fence set up.

2161
02:00:35.350 --> 02:00:38.980
Like you can have a high five.
I saw one that was for sale that was 200 acres.

2162
02:00:39.280 --> 02:00:40.270
That's not that much.

2163
02:00:40.510 --> 02:00:43.660
And at 200 acres there's a gang of deer in there and you wonder around through

2164
02:00:43.661 --> 02:00:44.111
the woods,

2165
02:00:44.111 --> 02:00:47.410
you set up a fucking stand and you have feeders and there's a big thing is the

2166
02:00:47.411 --> 02:00:52.060
feeders.
Six o'clock in the morning you say it's boring.
I'd eat it,

2167
02:00:52.420 --> 02:00:54.430
I'll do it if I want to eat it.
I'd like harvesting.

2168
02:00:54.431 --> 02:00:56.970
That's called harvesting meet.
It's sort of,
it's,

2169
02:00:56.971 --> 02:01:00.340
it's not the same kind of hunting cause you know there's animals there,

2170
02:01:00.520 --> 02:01:04.600
but it's also those animals at least are living a natural life as opposed to the

2171
02:01:04.601 --> 02:01:07.330
animals.
That's what I mean.
It's harvesting your natural meat.

2172
02:01:07.331 --> 02:01:09.460
I'd call it target practice and the harvesting,

2173
02:01:09.461 --> 02:01:12.670
natural meat hunting to me is kind of what we did,

2174
02:01:12.671 --> 02:01:17.671
which was the idea of having to not only know where the animals were,

2175
02:01:17.711 --> 02:01:18.790
how they were going to behave,

2176
02:01:18.791 --> 02:01:22.150
where they were going to be getting up early because that's when they forward

2177
02:01:22.360 --> 02:01:25.860
all that stuff.
Glass in the field be gone three days without getting a deer.

2178
02:01:25.870 --> 02:01:30.580
You know that stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well that's,
I mean we did.
We're still super lucky.

2179
02:01:30.790 --> 02:01:33.100
You know,
we,
we both got a deer the first time we went hunting.

2180
02:01:33.130 --> 02:01:34.330
I had a friend when I was growing up,

2181
02:01:34.750 --> 02:01:39.750
David Abel and David's dad used to go out hunting every fucking year and this

2182
02:01:40.521 --> 02:01:45.020
guy never shot a deer.
He never shot a fucking deer.
He went every year.

2183
02:01:45.021 --> 02:01:48.290
The guy was a hunter and he's like,
you,
you know,
had my dad's a hunter,

2184
02:01:48.291 --> 02:01:51.080
but he's never shot a deer.
I go,
you dad's never shot a deer.
No,

2185
02:01:51.081 --> 02:01:53.720
I've never shot a deer.
How often does he hunted?
Every year.

2186
02:01:53.900 --> 02:01:55.430
He goes on every year.
I'm like,
dude,

2187
02:01:55.431 --> 02:01:58.910
you're doing something fucking Wayne Rod centers.
I don't know.

2188
02:01:59.000 --> 02:02:00.860
Well it's just people don't know what the fuck they're doing.

2189
02:02:01.190 --> 02:02:04.220
You know Rinella is like a legit hunter.
You know,

2190
02:02:04.221 --> 02:02:06.170
some people they just go wander through the woods.

2191
02:02:06.200 --> 02:02:09.680
Well hope a deer shows up soccer trued it.
Is this a good spot to stop mode?

2192
02:02:09.681 --> 02:02:12.290
We'll stop right here and wait for a deer and you might get lucky.

2193
02:02:12.350 --> 02:02:15.170
A deer might wander in front of you but most likely know,

2194
02:02:15.380 --> 02:02:18.630
especially when you're dealing with like heavily hunted woods,
you know,

2195
02:02:18.631 --> 02:02:22.040
like a big pressure.
Well they know the difference too,

2196
02:02:22.130 --> 02:02:24.050
dear know when they're being hunted,
you know it's,

2197
02:02:24.090 --> 02:02:27.860
it's Mike is smelling you like you gotta be real careful about the smell.

2198
02:02:27.861 --> 02:02:31.400
There was a couple times like when dear saw you,
they would let go.

2199
02:02:31.401 --> 02:02:33.230
What the fuck is that?
They would,

2200
02:02:33.260 --> 02:02:35.690
they would sort of stand around a little bit and look at you,

2201
02:02:35.810 --> 02:02:38.930
but if they smelled you they would fucking bolt.

2202
02:02:39.110 --> 02:02:41.060
Because we smell like killers.
Yeah.

2203
02:02:41.061 --> 02:02:45.230
We eat meat when it's not like mediators dear can really smell that.

2204
02:02:45.231 --> 02:02:46.310
And it's a trip to see.

2205
02:02:46.490 --> 02:02:51.490
We were up this on this Ridge and the wind was blowing behind us and straight

2206
02:02:51.921 --> 02:02:56.921
towards this deer and this deer looked at us and started fucking running just

2207
02:02:57.771 --> 02:03:02.210
full clip through the woods.
And I was like,
cause that,
cause he,
we saw him going,

2208
02:03:02.240 --> 02:03:04.940
no,
that wouldn't,
they wouldn't do it if they just saw us.
They smelled us.

2209
02:03:05.950 --> 02:03:09.320
They can see that's like elk.
Like you could smell it bad pussy.

2210
02:03:10.550 --> 02:03:13.190
But you know what?
Similar skunks,
you know,

2211
02:03:13.191 --> 02:03:16.130
like people say that our sense of smell is not that strong.
It's right.

2212
02:03:16.131 --> 02:03:21.020
But it is what skunks,
a skunk can have like one part per million.
You know,

2213
02:03:21.021 --> 02:03:24.980
like the amount of smell that a skunk releases from his ass is really not that

2214
02:03:24.981 --> 02:03:28.730
big.
But you could smell it in your car.
Oh yeah.
You can smell it in your car.

2215
02:03:29.740 --> 02:03:32.960
Air Conditioning.
When you're driving a half a mile away,

2216
02:03:32.961 --> 02:03:35.660
a skunk blasts a dog and you're half a mile away.

2217
02:03:35.740 --> 02:03:39.530
That's how that must have to be.
How dogs like pickup scent.
It is.
It is.

2218
02:03:39.531 --> 02:03:42.290
Supposedly that's the best.
And we can't normally,

2219
02:03:42.291 --> 02:03:44.900
we can't really wrap our heads around that until you bring up skunk and then

2220
02:03:44.901 --> 02:03:49.540
you'd go,
oh,
okay,
yeah,
why can I smell that?
I can smell the fuck on it.

2221
02:03:49.541 --> 02:03:53.450
Some skunk,
like bloodhounds.
Yeah,
but you could do that.
I mean,

2222
02:03:53.451 --> 02:03:56.330
imagine if you could do that with like fear,
you know,

2223
02:03:56.400 --> 02:04:00.350
we know where the fear is coming from,
you know,

2224
02:04:00.380 --> 02:04:02.480
or you smell a murderer.
You know,

2225
02:04:02.510 --> 02:04:05.900
that's what a deer is essentially saying that you can smell things and you don't

2226
02:04:05.901 --> 02:04:09.500
even realize,
but they register with you.
Like based on your child and this stuff.

2227
02:04:09.700 --> 02:04:13.760
Human beings pickup and minuscule,
they still,
we still pick from artists and,

2228
02:04:14.040 --> 02:04:17.640
and there's a great deal of information in that.
Well,
the idea of,
um,

2229
02:04:17.720 --> 02:04:22.310
one of the ideas there was bandied about about schizophrenia was that it was a

2230
02:04:22.311 --> 02:04:27.311
pheromonal disease and that people smelled you and you smelled wrong.

2231
02:04:27.860 --> 02:04:32.390
And so they acted weird to you.
And so you started thinking,

2232
02:04:32.420 --> 02:04:36.960
Oh wow,
I'm weird because people respond to me.
Weird.
Yeah.

2233
02:04:37.140 --> 02:04:38.220
And there's also,

2234
02:04:38.220 --> 02:04:41.340
<v 1>um,
I think it's called Aloe phrenia.</v>

2235
02:04:41.940 --> 02:04:45.810
And the idea is that if you are around a schizophrenia person,

2236
02:04:45.811 --> 02:04:48.390
like say if your schizophrenia and I go to visit you in the hospital,

2237
02:04:48.540 --> 02:04:51.540
it's possible that through me interacting with you,

2238
02:04:51.600 --> 02:04:54.880
I can exhibit schizophrenia behavior like the unknown,

2239
02:04:55.120 --> 02:04:57.810
unknown unheard of schizophrenia behavior before

2240
02:04:58.030 --> 02:04:58.920
<v 2>you know,
you know,
um,</v>

2241
02:04:59.260 --> 02:05:02.260
I remember there was a girl that was that I could never figure out why I wasn't

2242
02:05:02.261 --> 02:05:05.950
attracted to her and she always liked me.
I could never pull the trigger.

2243
02:05:05.980 --> 02:05:09.760
And I realized one day she didn't smell like anything cause a friend of mine

2244
02:05:09.761 --> 02:05:11.680
goes,
you know why I don't like her.
And I said,
why?

2245
02:05:11.710 --> 02:05:16.420
I said she doesn't smell like anything dude.
She doesn't have any scent and that,

2246
02:05:16.421 --> 02:05:19.270
and I was like,
and I would hug her and I go and there was nothing,

2247
02:05:19.330 --> 02:05:23.020
literally she had no scent is,
I don't even know how to describe it.

2248
02:05:23.021 --> 02:05:26.000
It was like this,
I don't even know how to describe it.
It was like,
um,

2249
02:05:26.680 --> 02:05:31.610
obviously there's a scent,
but it was scentless.
It was like a,
I dunno man,
it was,

2250
02:05:31.620 --> 02:05:32.453
it was,
oh wow.

2251
02:05:32.550 --> 02:05:35.660
<v 1>A thing that people give off and I don't know if I'd call it a smell,</v>

2252
02:05:35.661 --> 02:05:37.520
but I do call.
I always say it's a smell.

2253
02:05:37.521 --> 02:05:40.410
Like I could smell the crazy on this bitch.
I always say that

2254
02:05:40.510 --> 02:05:43.930
<v 2>snow,
but it's not really a smell.
It's like a thing that people give off.
Well,</v>

2255
02:05:43.931 --> 02:05:48.460
it's a rhythm.
You know,
pheromones or whatever that is.
Brian Keeley,
she's like,

2256
02:05:48.461 --> 02:05:50.590
if a guy doesn't smell right,
I'll just be like,
fuck it.

2257
02:05:50.591 --> 02:05:53.440
I don't care how awesome you are if you don't have the right sense.
She's well,

2258
02:05:53.441 --> 02:05:58.420
our friend Patty,
one time he or she ever tell you the story she was on.
She was,

2259
02:05:58.560 --> 02:06:01.000
I met this guy.
I actually knew the guy a little bit.

2260
02:06:01.360 --> 02:06:06.160
She went on a date with this guy like three times and he just didn't smell

2261
02:06:06.161 --> 02:06:07.690
right.
He didn't smell right.

2262
02:06:08.140 --> 02:06:11.380
She just didn't like the way he smelled and he ended up dying of AIDS.

2263
02:06:11.500 --> 02:06:15.580
He had aids.
Whoa.
She smelled him dancing.
She was like,

2264
02:06:15.610 --> 02:06:19.810
I just don't like the way he smells and I,
I just can't pull the trigger.

2265
02:06:19.811 --> 02:06:22.270
I don't want to kiss the guy.
I don't want it.
And then he ended up,

2266
02:06:22.280 --> 02:06:25.100
he turned out he was,
and I'm not saying all people that have aids snow,

2267
02:06:25.101 --> 02:06:29.970
but I'm just this guy,
no drug use or drug user.
He used to hit,
it used to be any,

2268
02:06:29.980 --> 02:06:34.810
got it that way,
but he was a,
he fucking ended up dying of it.
Wow.

2269
02:06:34.880 --> 02:06:37.100
You know,
that's fucked rank,
dark,
dark.

2270
02:06:37.400 --> 02:06:40.130
<v 1>You know,
I still can't get anybody to fucking debate.
Peter Duesberg.</v>

2271
02:06:41.020 --> 02:06:45.350
Matt stacks has tried time and time again.
He has reached out to all these,

2272
02:06:45.590 --> 02:06:49.880
searched out all these researchers,
all these,
um,
doctors that I've gotten,

2273
02:06:49.881 --> 02:06:50.890
people that's like,

2274
02:06:50.940 --> 02:06:55.190
or apparently researchers that have heard slurs at me and fucking,
you know,

2275
02:06:55.220 --> 02:06:59.570
said that,
uh,
um,
almost guilty of murder by having him on.
And I was like,
look,

2276
02:06:59.571 --> 02:07:02.840
I don't,
I don't have an opinion.
I don't,
I'm not,
I've said it,

2277
02:07:02.841 --> 02:07:06.860
and I'll say it again with the aids thing or with HIV or any,

2278
02:07:06.861 --> 02:07:08.170
anything where I'm an educated in,

2279
02:07:08.171 --> 02:07:12.860
it's absolutely terrifying to be too stupid to know who's retarded because I

2280
02:07:12.861 --> 02:07:15.830
don't know.
I don't know if he's right.
I don't know if they're right.

2281
02:07:15.831 --> 02:07:16.990
I don't know what's going on the guy.

2282
02:07:17.190 --> 02:07:20.780
But I know the guy's brilliant and apparently has cancer research is top notch.

2283
02:07:20.781 --> 02:07:24.530
She's like made some leaps and bounds in cancer research.

2284
02:07:24.531 --> 02:07:27.950
He's got some really interesting work that he's done that's a very respected and

2285
02:07:27.951 --> 02:07:31.490
some of the most like is the first peer reviewed stuff in a long time.

2286
02:07:31.700 --> 02:07:35.530
But there's a lot of people that don't buy anything that he's saying it comes to

2287
02:07:35.531 --> 02:07:36.280
HIV

2288
02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:37.680
<v 3>and AIDS and be tough.</v>

2289
02:07:37.870 --> 02:07:40.590
There are a lot of people that have worked very closely with that virus and,

2290
02:07:40.720 --> 02:07:45.490
and so,
you know,
it seems that and,
and had been very,
very,

2291
02:07:45.491 --> 02:07:48.970
uh,
tireless in raising money for things in that,
you know,

2292
02:07:48.971 --> 02:07:52.120
things like keeping people on retro virals and things like that.

2293
02:07:52.121 --> 02:07:54.970
So I think that they,
there are a lot of people that seem to,

2294
02:07:55.220 --> 02:07:57.400
are in the trenches and do know a lot about it.

2295
02:07:57.430 --> 02:08:01.360
And maybe when someone like just very comes along and says something like that,

2296
02:08:01.361 --> 02:08:03.690
they're not even interested,
whatever his name is,
denied,

2297
02:08:03.950 --> 02:08:05.860
they're not even interested in debating it.

2298
02:08:05.861 --> 02:08:08.380
There are a lot of people would be like,
well,
it's too crazy to debate so well,

2299
02:08:08.381 --> 02:08:12.190
I think that any light that you could shed on and even if you're debating with

2300
02:08:12.370 --> 02:08:16.680
the idea,
is that if you,
you would give him power by addressing him as a,

2301
02:08:16.690 --> 02:08:20.770
you somehow give them legitimacy.
Yes,
I read his,

2302
02:08:20.771 --> 02:08:24.010
I read what he gave me and you know,
and,
and um,

2303
02:08:24.840 --> 02:08:29.230
what was the problem with it?
Was that,
not that he,
he had his point he had made,

2304
02:08:29.231 --> 02:08:33.010
but I didn't see enough.
It was just a paper.
There wasn't enough,

2305
02:08:33.790 --> 02:08:38.440
there wasn't enough pure reviewed,
uh,
cohabitation with the paper.

2306
02:08:38.441 --> 02:08:41.080
There wasn't enough sort of enough people saying,
yes,

2307
02:08:41.081 --> 02:08:42.910
we've done the same research,

2308
02:08:43.180 --> 02:08:48.060
we've looked at the same data and we concur that that was the only issue.
Um,
uh,

2309
02:08:48.190 --> 02:08:51.280
even though he was citing mainstream statistics,
uh,

2310
02:08:51.490 --> 02:08:54.790
like the World Health Organization and the United Nations and stuff like that,

2311
02:08:55.000 --> 02:09:00.000
those same organizations he's also arguing with yet he's using them as his,

2312
02:09:01.030 --> 02:09:05.020
you know,
points of reference.
So you know,
I read it and,

2313
02:09:05.030 --> 02:09:08.770
and and well that's because he was trying to make a point about the deaths in

2314
02:09:08.771 --> 02:09:12.490
Africa and like what everybody talks about like what aids was going to do to

2315
02:09:12.491 --> 02:09:17.260
Africa when in fact there's the same amount of people who have aids has had aids

2316
02:09:17.261 --> 02:09:17.830
back then.

2317
02:09:17.830 --> 02:09:20.920
But yet the population has tripled and it didn't have the same effect in the

2318
02:09:20.921 --> 02:09:24.100
population that everybody said it was and now he's got an absolute point.
Sure.

2319
02:09:24.101 --> 02:09:26.680
It's rock solid.
See,
it's not,
I don't think it's an either or.

2320
02:09:26.681 --> 02:09:29.620
I think what he's saying,
he has some very good points.

2321
02:09:29.770 --> 02:09:34.210
I wish someone would explain what's wrong with what he's saying.

2322
02:09:34.211 --> 02:09:35.110
Must be some,
well,

2323
02:09:35.111 --> 02:09:38.940
what he's saying I think is that he said that the h what's controversial,

2324
02:09:38.941 --> 02:09:43.690
it says HIV.
He,
he knows that there's HIV and he,
and he agrees there's age,
right?

2325
02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:47.010
They says HIV doesn't cause aids.
What causes AIDS?

2326
02:09:47.060 --> 02:09:49.060
You can have the HIV virus in your body.

2327
02:09:49.061 --> 02:09:52.390
If you live a healthy lifestyle and you're not doing poppers and drugs,

2328
02:09:52.900 --> 02:09:57.040
you know you,
you can survive with that and it will not manifest itself as aids.

2329
02:09:57.280 --> 02:10:00.610
Those that had HIV in there,
I think that is actually saying no.

2330
02:10:00.610 --> 02:10:04.900
What he's saying is that the evidence of HIV in your system is not evidence that

2331
02:10:04.901 --> 02:10:08.530
you have caught a aids and it's diminishing your immune system.

2332
02:10:08.890 --> 02:10:12.160
The evidence of age in your system is evidence of a diminished immune system

2333
02:10:12.161 --> 02:10:14.330
because that's the only way HIV exists in your system.

2334
02:10:14.331 --> 02:10:19.000
He's saying HIV is a weak virus and that the only way your body can't fight it

2335
02:10:19.001 --> 02:10:21.610
off is if your immune system is already compromised.
That's,

2336
02:10:21.670 --> 02:10:25.450
that's essentially saying and he believes that that compromising it's from drugs

2337
02:10:25.870 --> 02:10:29.200
and you know,
having a mom was a weird thing because,
you know,
look,

2338
02:10:29.260 --> 02:10:33.840
the guy says he wants to come on and tell a story.
I,
again,
I don't understand

2339
02:10:34.250 --> 02:10:36.920
<v 1>enough of molecular biology to know if he's right or wrong,</v>

2340
02:10:36.921 --> 02:10:40.310
but I do know that he's a fucking professor at Stanford,
Berkeley,
Berkeley,

2341
02:10:40.460 --> 02:10:45.350
Berkeley Rather.
Yeah.
I mean he's a,
he's a Oh recognized guy.
I mean he's,

2342
02:10:45.770 --> 02:10:50.240
he apparently at one point in time before all this HIV aids thing was very well

2343
02:10:50.241 --> 02:10:51.950
respected,
but now he's a pariah.

2344
02:10:53.030 --> 02:10:57.670
<v 3>I don't,
he may be crazy.
Oh yeah.
You know,
he may just be a complete Kook.</v>

2345
02:10:58.100 --> 02:11:02.450
Uh,
we had a lot of weird shit.
They called black people's spots as,
and you know,

2346
02:11:03.450 --> 02:11:07.790
my vivid thing is the Nazi,
the gaze.
You can say,
it's funny,

2347
02:11:07.791 --> 02:11:08.870
you can say the gays,

2348
02:11:08.970 --> 02:11:12.840
<v 1>but you can't say the blacks.
You can say the gays love disco,</v>

2349
02:11:12.960 --> 02:11:17.640
but he can't see the blacks loved chicken.
You can't say that.
It's like,
you know,

2350
02:11:18.450 --> 02:11:19.440
there's a certain

2351
02:11:19.830 --> 02:11:22.930
<v 3>ks love disco.
I didn't know you could say that.
They loved to dance.</v>

2352
02:11:22.960 --> 02:11:26.480
You could say the gays love to dance.
I love to dance.
What's that movie?

2353
02:11:26.490 --> 02:11:29.350
Allee fuck yes.
I want to be a Spanish dancer.

2354
02:11:29.351 --> 02:11:32.170
I want to be a professional fucking so to be everybody.
That's what I want.

2355
02:11:32.230 --> 02:11:34.510
I put you don't want to be yourself.
Be Nick Diaz.

2356
02:11:34.630 --> 02:11:38.230
You want to be everybody to sell 10 a Karalyn.
I'm bored with myself.

2357
02:11:38.231 --> 02:11:40.210
What the fuck?
I want to be a fighter.

2358
02:11:40.211 --> 02:11:42.970
You've been yourself for too long and that's all it is.
I want to be a fighter.

2359
02:11:43.060 --> 02:11:46.840
I want to be,
if I want to be Joe Rogan.
You don't want to be mean.
No,
no.

2360
02:11:47.050 --> 02:11:50.620
All right.
It's too difficult.
It's a lot of work.
A lot of work.

2361
02:11:50.710 --> 02:11:51.880
It's contradictory.

2362
02:11:52.750 --> 02:11:56.050
Lyer on fucking warm water in the middle of the night and trying to figure shit

2363
02:11:56.051 --> 02:12:00.160
out.
It's too much work.
I know.
Better off having less questions.
A lot.

2364
02:12:00.250 --> 02:12:03.930
It's fucking,
that's all I have is better off being like a bowler,
you know,

2365
02:12:03.970 --> 02:12:06.680
something real simple.
Just concentrate on knocking those pins.
What?

2366
02:12:06.760 --> 02:12:07.241
Think about it,

2367
02:12:07.241 --> 02:12:11.650
if you could be one person and you could be one fucking person in the world and

2368
02:12:11.651 --> 02:12:15.760
it can't be you,
who do you think?
What would you be?
Bano Richard Branson.

2369
02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:17.950
I have never thought about that for even a second.

2370
02:12:18.010 --> 02:12:21.850
I've never spent any time wanting to be anybody but me.
Right?
Yeah.

2371
02:12:22.270 --> 02:12:25.120
I think you got this life.
I'm fucking super lucky.

2372
02:12:25.390 --> 02:12:28.780
You know you're super lucky and you could,
you could sue.
Boom goes,
look.

2373
02:12:28.830 --> 02:12:32.260
You know it was lucky.
I actually never feel that one.
No,

2374
02:12:32.320 --> 02:12:35.650
you're not that type of guy.
A lot of weak bitches that do that.

2375
02:12:35.710 --> 02:12:38.380
You know there's a lot of you,
you,

2376
02:12:38.410 --> 02:12:40.900
you use your talents that you have figured what the,

2377
02:12:40.901 --> 02:12:43.780
out what they are and then use them to the best of your ability.

2378
02:12:43.781 --> 02:12:47.920
And that's where the answers like,
I mean fucking,
you know,
enjoy it.
And you know,

2379
02:12:48.330 --> 02:12:51.270
<v 1>this guy said something to him on the message board that said that,
uh,</v>

2380
02:12:51.300 --> 02:12:53.730
I give too much.
I,

2381
02:12:53.880 --> 02:12:57.420
I'm a too much attached to the idea that I'm responsible for my own success.

2382
02:12:57.421 --> 02:13:00.630
And he was saying that a lot of people that are very intelligent people can

2383
02:13:00.631 --> 02:13:01.370
barely,

2384
02:13:01.370 --> 02:13:06.240
a rise above subsistence and the barely barely get through and feed themselves

2385
02:13:06.510 --> 02:13:07.640
and all you,
that is

2386
02:13:07.890 --> 02:13:11.010
<v 3>horse shit.
That's the,
it's also not even the conversation to have.</v>

2387
02:13:11.011 --> 02:13:13.820
It's also what's the point?
The point then as you're making,
well the point is

2388
02:13:14.140 --> 02:13:15.410
<v 1>sang that,
you know,</v>

2389
02:13:15.460 --> 02:13:19.360
I shouldn't be taking credit for anything that I've done and that I just got

2390
02:13:19.361 --> 02:13:22.840
lucky.
But that's ridiculous because what I got lucky at everything,

2391
02:13:23.620 --> 02:13:27.670
everything from martial arts to comedy to commentary,

2392
02:13:27.671 --> 02:13:32.260
to running a podcast,
all that shit's luck.
All that shit's,
that's crazy talk.

2393
02:13:32.270 --> 02:13:36.210
<v 3>I like to say that someone is lucky because they've achieved success that you</v>

2394
02:13:36.211 --> 02:13:40.680
have been able to achieve is so self serving and so stupid.
Of course it is.

2395
02:13:40.681 --> 02:13:41.670
It's also giving him,

2396
02:13:41.671 --> 02:13:46.410
it's also letting himself off the hook that that that luck is all chance.

2397
02:13:46.440 --> 02:13:49.050
There is law,
there is locking in and success.

2398
02:13:49.180 --> 02:13:53.850
There's a degree of always but but at the same time you're not serving yourself

2399
02:13:53.851 --> 02:13:57.000
in any way.
By even having that conversation with yourself,

2400
02:13:57.450 --> 02:14:01.530
you're making an excuse for yourself and and,
and even if your excuse is valid,

2401
02:14:01.830 --> 02:14:04.530
even if you actually have a great that you get,
you know you,

2402
02:14:04.890 --> 02:14:07.320
I don't know your whole family,
God forbid,
dies in a fire.

2403
02:14:07.470 --> 02:14:09.480
Nobody really at the end of the day cares.

2404
02:14:09.481 --> 02:14:12.720
You got to suck it up and figure out a way to make whatever happens to you,

2405
02:14:12.721 --> 02:14:15.270
work for you.
You can't control the weather,

2406
02:14:15.271 --> 02:14:17.130
but you can control how you react to it.

2407
02:14:17.190 --> 02:14:21.420
You show me a successful or you show me an intelligent person rather who is

2408
02:14:21.421 --> 02:14:24.150
involved in any sort of endeavor but is unsuccessful,

2409
02:14:24.450 --> 02:14:27.150
and I'll show you someone who's doing it wrong.
That's right.
That's all it is.

2410
02:14:27.151 --> 02:14:30.060
And there's,
if there's people that are doing it right,
there's look baby,

2411
02:14:30.061 --> 02:14:32.580
they got more opportunities than you did or then he did.

2412
02:14:32.581 --> 02:14:35.530
But maybe they got less than that guy and they managed to succeed anyways.
No,

2413
02:14:35.531 --> 02:14:37.830
there's no,
there's no evenness to the world.

2414
02:14:37.831 --> 02:14:40.790
You just have what you're handed as like these,
these,

2415
02:14:40.800 --> 02:14:45.390
this style of thinking that,
you know,
somehow or another we'll,
you know what man,

2416
02:14:45.391 --> 02:14:47.310
you just got real look and you should be really happy.

2417
02:14:47.311 --> 02:14:51.870
But all things should happen to,
you know,
barring health issues,

2418
02:14:51.871 --> 02:14:53.430
which many people will occur,

2419
02:14:53.431 --> 02:14:57.720
which can fucking completely blow up any plans that you have.

2420
02:14:57.900 --> 02:15:00.120
And you have to deal with cancer.
You have to deal with anything.

2421
02:15:00.300 --> 02:15:04.950
Barring that and barring psychological issues or mental deficiencies or anything

2422
02:15:04.951 --> 02:15:07.650
physical.
If you're a normal person and you have an interest in something,

2423
02:15:07.860 --> 02:15:11.070
the only thing that's stopping you from being successful if other people are

2424
02:15:11.071 --> 02:15:12.810
successful is you haven't figured it out.

2425
02:15:12.811 --> 02:15:15.540
Your methodology doesn't necessarily mean that you're a loser.

2426
02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:18.300
It could means you haven't figured out how to win yet or you're going to

2427
02:15:18.301 --> 02:15:20.130
eventually just haven't applied those to you.

2428
02:15:20.131 --> 02:15:23.100
Or You could even die as an old man who is still trying.

2429
02:15:23.101 --> 02:15:24.240
You're still not a loser.

2430
02:15:24.390 --> 02:15:26.520
You're just a guy who hasn't figured out how to be a winner.
By the way,

2431
02:15:26.521 --> 02:15:29.970
there there are.
There are ways to look.
Look for the people that are successful.

2432
02:15:29.971 --> 02:15:33.450
There are people that can show you how to manage yourself in image,

2433
02:15:33.750 --> 02:15:38.220
manage managing.
You know how you think about the world,
managing,

2434
02:15:38.221 --> 02:15:40.950
how you choose to react to things that happened to you in the world.

2435
02:15:41.160 --> 02:15:44.940
That's fucking very important.
Learning how to talk to yourself.

2436
02:15:45.030 --> 02:15:48.000
Here's the most important thing,
the most important thing,

2437
02:15:48.001 --> 02:15:51.300
so round yourself on other people who are doing the same.
That's right.

2438
02:15:51.301 --> 02:15:54.450
I will inspire you and who are,
who holds you to,
to uh,

2439
02:15:54.510 --> 02:15:57.810
to the same standard they hold themselves and are honest with you.
Yes,

2440
02:15:57.840 --> 02:16:01.340
very important.
When I grew up,
one of the big things about,
um,

2441
02:16:01.830 --> 02:16:05.010
growing up and being ambitious is I had two friends.

2442
02:16:05.011 --> 02:16:08.700
Both of them were named Jimmy,
Jimmy Smith or Jimmy did Teleo and Jimmy lawless.

2443
02:16:08.970 --> 02:16:13.020
There's two friends who both had businesses while I was in high school and these

2444
02:16:13.030 --> 02:16:16.950
motherfuckers would get up early.
And lawless was a contractor,

2445
02:16:16.980 --> 02:16:20.760
there was a carpenter and a to,
he was an electrician and he had employees.

2446
02:16:20.761 --> 02:16:24.360
What time?
We were 18.
This motherfucker had a truck,
he had employees,

2447
02:16:24.630 --> 02:16:27.660
he was getting up in the morning,
they were ambitious,
they got shit done.

2448
02:16:27.660 --> 02:16:31.120
And if you are a lazy fuckhead sitting around on your couch watching television

2449
02:16:31.121 --> 02:16:35.020
not doing anything,
they look that you look you were a loser.
And that work ethic,

2450
02:16:35.021 --> 02:16:37.090
that like sort of east coast work ethic,

2451
02:16:37.330 --> 02:16:39.310
having those guys around me when I was young,
when I,

2452
02:16:39.340 --> 02:16:43.390
even though I had this completely alternative way of living,

2453
02:16:43.391 --> 02:16:46.970
you know with the martial arts competitions and stuff like that,
I still,
I,

2454
02:16:46.980 --> 02:16:51.760
I knew dudes that worked hard and I,
I felt these,
my friends worked hard.

2455
02:16:51.761 --> 02:16:53.980
I have to keep myself up to that same sort of standard.

2456
02:16:54.250 --> 02:16:57.400
If I had a bunch of losers who are just smoking weed all day and sleeping,

2457
02:16:58.060 --> 02:17:02.770
who knows?
Who knows where.
I would be surrounding yourself with like ambitious,

2458
02:17:02.771 --> 02:17:04.450
positive people who are happy,

2459
02:17:04.720 --> 02:17:08.470
so fucking important and get and get clear on what you fucking want to.

2460
02:17:08.471 --> 02:17:11.650
That I always was kind of clear on I,
even when I didn't know what I want,

2461
02:17:11.651 --> 02:17:14.630
I knew I wanted something.
I always had an image in my head of,

2462
02:17:15.670 --> 02:17:19.810
I think that's really important.
I think that dude,
what are you doing?

2463
02:17:19.811 --> 02:17:22.840
Like I talked to a comic the other day and he's a really talented guy who

2464
02:17:22.841 --> 02:17:25.150
doesn't,
right?
And it isn't.
I don't end.

2465
02:17:25.151 --> 02:17:28.360
He's like pushing fucking 35 and I looked into Michael,

2466
02:17:28.630 --> 02:17:31.990
you're really talented guy and I saw you eight years ago and you had something

2467
02:17:31.991 --> 02:17:34.150
to say,
what are you doing?
What do you,

2468
02:17:34.151 --> 02:17:38.290
what's the point of what you're doing on stage?
There's no direction whatsoever.

2469
02:17:38.420 --> 02:17:41.590
He's like,
ah,
I dunno.
I go,
that's your problem.
You've got,

2470
02:17:41.640 --> 02:17:43.940
you've just stopped thinking about who you are,

2471
02:17:43.970 --> 02:17:48.010
what you're trying to do with this opportunity,
with this expression.

2472
02:17:48.160 --> 02:17:51.190
Is it just for the public embrace?
Is that all it is?

2473
02:17:51.191 --> 02:17:52.990
Some people definitely get stuck in a Rut.

2474
02:17:53.700 --> 02:17:57.430
That certainly has start asking yourself questions that help you out of that
Rut.

2475
02:17:57.430 --> 02:17:58.870
Then inspiration,
you know,

2476
02:17:58.871 --> 02:18:02.170
and that's one of the most beautiful things about podcasts is I think there's

2477
02:18:02.171 --> 02:18:06.670
more podcasts in more inspiration available in podcast form.

2478
02:18:06.671 --> 02:18:08.010
Then maybe in any other medium.

2479
02:18:08.340 --> 02:18:11.740
So it's just the conversations that we've had on this podcast and the 300 plus

2480
02:18:11.741 --> 02:18:16.720
episodes we have,
what are we up to?
Like three,
three plus 306 episodes.

2481
02:18:16.721 --> 02:18:21.160
We'd so many of them filled with inspirational people and it just conversations

2482
02:18:21.161 --> 02:18:25.250
like this when,
when I get emails from people telling me that,
you know,

2483
02:18:25.251 --> 02:18:26.470
I'd lost 90 pounds.

2484
02:18:26.471 --> 02:18:29.320
I got on Kale shakes ever since I started listening to your podcasts changed my

2485
02:18:29.321 --> 02:18:32.530
life is great.
I know,
but I then I know that I was,

2486
02:18:33.160 --> 02:18:36.610
I was on to something that it's not,
but there's a bunch of losers out there.

2487
02:18:36.820 --> 02:18:37.031
It's,

2488
02:18:37.031 --> 02:18:40.990
there's a bunch of people that are in bad patterns and they could be winners.

2489
02:18:41.020 --> 02:18:44.320
They just need to be around people that inspire them and get them on good

2490
02:18:44.321 --> 02:18:49.321
patterns and much like people getting fucking nutty about masturbation and

2491
02:18:49.750 --> 02:18:54.160
jerking off to their Dick Bleeds or getting nutty about washing their hands like

2492
02:18:54.161 --> 02:18:57.730
people can get on shit patterns.
They can get on these weird patterns.

2493
02:18:57.760 --> 02:19:01.030
There's a great article that I just interviewed her on my podcast,

2494
02:19:01.031 --> 02:19:04.080
Kristy [inaudible].
She is a professor at Princeton.

2495
02:19:04.110 --> 02:19:08.010
Sounds like a great porn star.
She's beautiful.
Beautiful.
She's new.

2496
02:19:08.060 --> 02:19:10.480
She's beautiful.
She's 35 years old and she wrote,

2497
02:19:10.481 --> 02:19:14.350
she wrote this incredible article called live without irony.

2498
02:19:14.740 --> 02:19:19.740
A Wampold is Christie got to be the seat and she's a professor at Princeton and

2499
02:19:20.561 --> 02:19:23.110
she's,
she speaks.
That's how strong that is.
That that's not,

2500
02:19:23.500 --> 02:19:26.560
that's me leading my button.
Well that's,
it took that picture.

2501
02:19:26.561 --> 02:19:28.400
I put it on a 10 minute podcast page.

2502
02:19:28.640 --> 02:19:31.160
Why would he be there while you're cleaning your butt?

2503
02:19:31.580 --> 02:19:35.030
Cause I was going look at my bud and cleaning it and he took that picture.

2504
02:19:35.031 --> 02:19:38.600
I mean that seems like changing.
Look at that back on me though.

2505
02:19:38.601 --> 02:19:42.470
I'll muscular shit.
I don't think you need to have that.
That's a dense,

2506
02:19:42.471 --> 02:19:44.990
that's I'm looking at how am I ask kind of,
are you happy with that?

2507
02:19:45.020 --> 02:19:49.880
Where that looks.
I like my body.
Um,
but she,
she,

2508
02:19:49.881 --> 02:19:53.300
in the article,
I read it four times,
the article she said,
she said,
and we,

2509
02:19:53.730 --> 02:19:58.310
but not to plug the fucking Brian Callen charge.
She's beautiful.

2510
02:19:58.590 --> 02:20:01.460
She's gorgeous.
And she had her on your [inaudible].
Brilliant.

2511
02:20:01.461 --> 02:20:05.900
I don't run the podcast.
Did you fall in love?
Yeah.
She's so smart.
And she's so,

2512
02:20:06.350 --> 02:20:10.020
she's,
she's so articulate.
And she,
and we,

2513
02:20:10.370 --> 02:20:14.720
she was talking about how hipster lifestyle is a product of,
it's,

2514
02:20:14.721 --> 02:20:15.650
it's a very good article,

2515
02:20:15.651 --> 02:20:19.250
but it hips walks style is basically a product of a generation of people who

2516
02:20:19.251 --> 02:20:23.720
feel like they have nothing to offer as far as new ideas or new thoughts or

2517
02:20:23.721 --> 02:20:27.770
anything like that attached.
Yeah.
And so what happens is there's this preemptive,

2518
02:20:27.980 --> 02:20:28.280
this,

2519
02:20:28.280 --> 02:20:32.540
it's called preemptive Lynn living ironic living the idea of I've already failed

2520
02:20:32.541 --> 02:20:32.751
that it,

2521
02:20:32.751 --> 02:20:35.780
so I'm going to poo poo it and not really try hard and trying hard and being

2522
02:20:35.781 --> 02:20:39.680
direct it and with what you want is considered very gauche.

2523
02:20:39.830 --> 02:20:44.060
It's considered kind of like uncool.
We've,
we've,
and the way she does it,

2524
02:20:44.061 --> 02:20:47.180
it's called live without irony or just listen to the podcast.
It's,
it's,

2525
02:20:47.360 --> 02:20:52.250
she's so she kinda encapsulates what bothers me when I walk into a coffee shop

2526
02:20:52.251 --> 02:20:56.150
and a guy's dressed like a 1920s conductor with a mustache and a hat and he's

2527
02:20:56.151 --> 02:20:59.030
just too cool for school and not really trying.

2528
02:20:59.330 --> 02:21:04.330
And that I could never put my finger on why that sort of hipster behavior got to

2529
02:21:06.381 --> 02:21:09.350
me and she captures it perfectly.
It's nothing wrong with tattoos.

2530
02:21:09.351 --> 02:21:14.050
Nothing wrong with dressing cool.
It's,
it's the attitude around sort of a,

2531
02:21:14.051 --> 02:21:16.910
a culture that doesn't believe they have anything to offer.

2532
02:21:17.450 --> 02:21:20.240
People who are pretending that it's cool to not care.

2533
02:21:20.530 --> 02:21:24.670
And it's never cool to not care.
That's stupid.
It's,
it's a total cop out,
right?

2534
02:21:24.930 --> 02:21:28.900
It gives a fuck stop.
It doesn't matter.
It does matter.
Every moment matters.

2535
02:21:28.910 --> 02:21:29.900
It doesn't matter silly.

2536
02:21:30.290 --> 02:21:32.960
You're being silly and you're wasting your life because every single moment

2537
02:21:32.961 --> 02:21:34.120
matters.
And the matters.

2538
02:21:34.160 --> 02:21:37.400
They're the moments that you feel with passion or more exciting moments,

2539
02:21:37.430 --> 02:21:40.820
they're more thrilling,
fulfilling.
They're more satisfying moments.

2540
02:21:40.821 --> 02:21:43.910
And for you to sit there with your fucking Cardigan on and pretend it doesn't

2541
02:21:43.911 --> 02:21:47.450
matter,
and you know you're a silly bitch,
you're lying to yourself.

2542
02:21:47.480 --> 02:21:50.120
You're align yourself and you're not going to get anything band you're being and

2543
02:21:50.121 --> 02:21:53.420
you're walking around a critic and a cynic,
so you have nothing to offer.

2544
02:21:53.420 --> 02:21:57.200
But criticism of people who really do try and you have and all you do is you can

2545
02:21:57.201 --> 02:22:00.380
come and say you're really lucky that you should feel really lucky that you're

2546
02:22:00.381 --> 02:22:03.410
doing well.
That has no relevance to anything.
Yes,
life has luck,

2547
02:22:03.590 --> 02:22:07.900
but I work really hard and I'm really direct and I go for what I want.
Yeah.

2548
02:22:07.901 --> 02:22:08.880
There was nothing wrong with that.

2549
02:22:09.320 --> 02:22:14.240
A bunch of people that don't want anyone to take any credit for anything that

2550
02:22:14.241 --> 02:22:18.200
they've done because somehow or other they feel that if you have succeeded in

2551
02:22:18.201 --> 02:22:21.020
any way,
shape or form on your own through without,

2552
02:22:21.050 --> 02:22:25.890
I mean without any approval like lottery style version of luck that been struck

2553
02:22:25.891 --> 02:22:26.310
you

2554
02:22:26.310 --> 02:22:29.460
<v 1>how well it's,
could you be in a position that's ahead of me?</v>

2555
02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:32.760
How else could you be in a position where you're making more money or you have

2556
02:22:32.761 --> 02:22:36.930
more success or you were by my age,
it has to be some lucky break.

2557
02:22:36.931 --> 02:22:37.940
Must've been bestowed upon.

2558
02:22:37.950 --> 02:22:40.800
What I say to people like that is stop looking at people that way.

2559
02:22:40.801 --> 02:22:43.090
Look at people in a different way.
Look at a guy like Joe Rogan.

2560
02:22:43.100 --> 02:22:46.080
Is it someone who's inspiring and going to fac I can do it.

2561
02:22:46.081 --> 02:22:48.630
That's an example of what I can do that can be empowering.

2562
02:22:48.631 --> 02:22:52.080
But if you sit back and decide in your head that,
well,
you know,

2563
02:22:52.081 --> 02:22:54.510
you have to realize that you got lucky.
Okay,
no,

2564
02:22:54.511 --> 02:22:58.740
I don't have to realize anything and you're being a silly fuck.
You're,
you're,

2565
02:22:58.741 --> 02:23:00.930
you're wasting thoughts.
You're not doing exactly.

2566
02:23:00.931 --> 02:23:02.790
You're not doing yourself any favor with that kind of thought.

2567
02:23:02.820 --> 02:23:05.520
I watched real housewives of Beverly Hills last night and talking about wasting

2568
02:23:05.521 --> 02:23:07.720
thoughts and uh,
fun.

2569
02:23:07.760 --> 02:23:12.750
And he just said that these wretched conch,
okay.
Which is what they are.

2570
02:23:12.751 --> 02:23:14.610
Some of them,
not all of them,
some of them.

2571
02:23:14.611 --> 02:23:17.370
I think that I feel bad for them that just women who need money and they're

2572
02:23:17.371 --> 02:23:19.110
stuck in these weird social situations,

2573
02:23:19.111 --> 02:23:23.560
but hanging out with these other clients and they're all vapid and they had a

2574
02:23:23.580 --> 02:23:28.020
like a 10 minute App,
part of an episode,
more than 10 minutes,

2575
02:23:28.021 --> 02:23:32.430
at least 15 minutes where they talked about whether or not a girl was rude for

2576
02:23:32.431 --> 02:23:36.650
telling another girl,
shut the fuck up.
And that's all they talked about.
Oh,

2577
02:23:36.651 --> 02:23:39.450
she was so rude,
you know?
Why didn't you say that?
She didn't have to say that.

2578
02:23:39.570 --> 02:23:42.990
Why did she say that?
I thought it was so rude.
Of course it's rude,
you know?
Well,

2579
02:23:43.020 --> 02:23:45.810
I think her point was,
well,
forget about where her point was.
That's human.

2580
02:23:46.210 --> 02:23:49.050
That's human beings who need conflict.
And if they don't have conflict,

2581
02:23:49.090 --> 02:23:50.690
I'm something to push against.
They'll,

2582
02:23:50.730 --> 02:23:54.150
they'll invent crazy social bullshit.

2583
02:23:54.151 --> 02:23:57.690
It was the whole episode and I was like,
this is so fascinating.

2584
02:23:57.900 --> 02:24:02.430
I watched a whole episode of Jersey shore and in the whole episode was the

2585
02:24:02.431 --> 02:24:07.260
situation wanting to leave the club,
but he wanted everybody else to leave too,

2586
02:24:07.261 --> 02:24:11.820
but they didn't want to leave.
So that was the whole episode was the situation.

2587
02:24:11.821 --> 02:24:15.270
Go,
come on,
let's get out of here.
Forget reading.
I'm going to watch Jersey shore.

2588
02:24:15.330 --> 02:24:18.180
They would pull the individuals aside,
you know,
in the style of the show.

2589
02:24:18.181 --> 02:24:21.060
Like there'd be facing the camera and he'd be like,
well you know,

2590
02:24:21.120 --> 02:24:22.740
he wasn't scoring,

2591
02:24:22.741 --> 02:24:26.190
he wasn't picking up any girls so he wanted to go but he was being rude about it

2592
02:24:26.191 --> 02:24:28.530
and we didn't want to go and he's like,
come on,
let's go and look.

2593
02:24:28.560 --> 02:24:30.900
I don't want to go.
It's the whole episode.
Do you think,

2594
02:24:31.240 --> 02:24:32.020
do you think those things,

2595
02:24:32.020 --> 02:24:34.940
their shows are popular because they allow people to kind of,

2596
02:24:34.950 --> 02:24:36.090
it takes the pressure off people.

2597
02:24:36.091 --> 02:24:39.600
They feel like they are watching kind of themselves.
What do you think?

2598
02:24:39.601 --> 02:24:43.500
It's a trick.
It's just a ropes.
You in it,
it hijacks all of your,

2599
02:24:43.501 --> 02:24:47.040
your your normal systems that are set up to monitor actual life and you're

2600
02:24:47.041 --> 02:24:49.260
participating in the life that you have no stakes in.

2601
02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:51.810
You have nothing in you not thinking involved.
You know,
whether the,

2602
02:24:51.811 --> 02:24:55.640
the this guy breaks up with his wife or there's like a lot of those guys that

2603
02:24:55.641 --> 02:24:58.130
are the people like men are on that show and a,

2604
02:24:58.180 --> 02:25:00.840
they're starting to realize what dumb cunts their wives are.

2605
02:25:00.841 --> 02:25:02.790
And they're fucking bailing on them in the middle of the shell.

2606
02:25:02.791 --> 02:25:06.060
Like Kelsey Grammer got rid of his wife and middle of the show.
Yeah.

2607
02:25:06.061 --> 02:25:08.070
That was part of the show was that she wanted,
you know,

2608
02:25:08.071 --> 02:25:11.670
my husband's famous and I'm gonna step out behind his shadow and all of a sudden

2609
02:25:11.671 --> 02:25:15.480
she's on and everyone's like,
here's fucking wretched bitch.
What the fuck?

2610
02:25:15.481 --> 02:25:20.220
So she was a extreme con during the first episode.
Kelsey Grammer leaves her,

2611
02:25:20.340 --> 02:25:24.070
everyone hates it.
A really nice guy by the hay or the

2612
02:25:24.070 --> 02:25:27.190
<v 2>waves of hate that bus were bestowed upon her,</v>

2613
02:25:27.280 --> 02:25:30.460
completely changed her personality.
And so then from that season on,

2614
02:25:30.550 --> 02:25:35.360
she's super nice to everyone.
Just fake as fuck.
Oh,
nice as pie.

2615
02:25:35.361 --> 02:25:38.020
And Kathy,
grandma leaves you.
He's a really nice human beings.
You know,

2616
02:25:38.021 --> 02:25:42.190
I never tell you my Kelsey Grammer story.
He fucking,
he did me a solid,

2617
02:25:42.220 --> 02:25:47.140
I'll never forget this guy for this.
I'm on a date.
I'm in Nobu in Malibu.

2618
02:25:47.200 --> 02:25:49.210
It costs $1 million for dinner there.

2619
02:25:49.211 --> 02:25:53.050
And I take this girl out who I'd seen singing and she was beautiful and I just

2620
02:25:53.051 --> 02:25:55.990
wanted to get laid because she was such a good singer and so hot.

2621
02:25:56.230 --> 02:25:58.750
She couldn't have been less interested in me.

2622
02:25:58.751 --> 02:26:00.430
She was looking at me like I was a spore,

2623
02:26:00.640 --> 02:26:05.230
but I had done well then how'd you get her out?
I mean,
she kind of liked me.

2624
02:26:05.231 --> 02:26:08.380
Then she realized she was just like literally almost yawning through the dinner.

2625
02:26:08.380 --> 02:26:08.621
I was like,

2626
02:26:08.621 --> 02:26:11.680
I'm not going to get laid and I'm spending fucking my house payments on this

2627
02:26:11.681 --> 02:26:16.150
fucking dinner.
Right?
So Kelsey Grammer comes in with a whole bunch of people.

2628
02:26:17.110 --> 02:26:18.070
I had done Frazier,

2629
02:26:18.071 --> 02:26:22.540
so I Kinda knew him and I had just done inside Schwartz or some shit.

2630
02:26:22.770 --> 02:26:25.350
What do you remember that show?
And he had,
and it was on NBC,

2631
02:26:25.370 --> 02:26:29.110
the same network as he has,
and he had seen it.
The guide comes over,

2632
02:26:29.170 --> 02:26:32.280
the guy comes over,
pretends he knows my name,
but he couldn't remember it.
So hey,

2633
02:26:32.281 --> 02:26:35.560
it's Brian.
He goes,
Hey,
I want to come over and say hi.
I loved you in the pilot.

2634
02:26:35.561 --> 02:26:38.320
You were great.
And you were so great on Frasier,
thanks for doing it.

2635
02:26:38.710 --> 02:26:42.670
And he basically was making me look good for this girl.

2636
02:26:42.671 --> 02:26:46.390
He was so clearly,
he was so clearly throwing me the ball.

2637
02:26:46.600 --> 02:26:51.040
It was so I could tell he was doing it for me.
And it's called Jihadi.
Yeah.

2638
02:26:51.041 --> 02:26:55.120
And cuts.
It cuts it.
We used to call it now.
Yeah.
When someone blows you up,

2639
02:26:55.150 --> 02:26:59.830
like if I saw Brian,
you see Brian talking to some girls over in jihad?

2640
02:26:59.900 --> 02:27:02.330
Yes.
That's what a friend does.
Yeah.

2641
02:27:02.390 --> 02:27:04.660
And the dude did it for me and he barely knew me.

2642
02:27:04.661 --> 02:27:07.540
I'd just done a show in stuff and,
and,
and I'll never forget him for that.

2643
02:27:07.720 --> 02:27:10.780
And that makes him,
and he was such a fucking great guy.
Anyway,

2644
02:27:10.781 --> 02:27:14.200
everybody loves the guy.
But I mean,
I was like,
what a fucking cool guy.

2645
02:27:14.201 --> 02:27:16.270
You didn't have to come over to my table and do that for me.

2646
02:27:16.271 --> 02:27:18.940
But you did this one guy and I got,
and by the way,

2647
02:27:18.941 --> 02:27:23.530
I got laid on the sun and the fucking piece.
I was young,
I was young,
I was young,

2648
02:27:23.531 --> 02:27:25.600
I was young.
I'm kidding with this girl,

2649
02:27:26.270 --> 02:27:29.110
but I don't know the ones that this girl that wasn't,
yes,

2650
02:27:29.170 --> 02:27:32.770
she meant did it clearly change?
It's about face bro.
Really?

2651
02:27:32.830 --> 02:27:34.630
That's what I'm saying.
I didn't even make it home.

2652
02:27:35.340 --> 02:27:36.173
<v 6>Wow.</v>

2653
02:27:37.300 --> 02:27:40.810
<v 4>Do you guys see the commercial with Brad Pitt's brother?
He's now Doug pit.</v>

2654
02:27:40.840 --> 02:27:45.580
You know,
he's now the host
virgin wouldn't make a bet.

2655
02:27:45.760 --> 02:27:48.190
Come on.
Virgin Mobile.
Uh,
Australia.

2656
02:27:48.191 --> 02:27:52.090
He's the main host and I see that he's a little brother and he looks creepily

2657
02:27:52.091 --> 02:27:52.451
like him.

2658
02:27:52.451 --> 02:27:55.690
Like as if this guy got hit by a car and there were twins in the system.

2659
02:27:58.820 --> 02:28:01.270
Wait,
what do you want?
Let me find the real commercial with for that.

2660
02:28:01.440 --> 02:28:04.780
Somebody that's a joke.
I can tell you that's a joke.
No,
it's,
it's real.

2661
02:28:05.050 --> 02:28:07.540
They had him on the today show yesterday

2662
02:28:07.720 --> 02:28:11.050
<v 6>or two days ago.
Uh,

Here he is.
Brad.
Pick brother.</v>

2663
02:28:11.200 --> 02:28:12.710
<v 2>Okay,
well why are you looking at that?</v>

2664
02:28:12.730 --> 02:28:16.480
There's another thing I wanted to talk about when with gang rapes.

2665
02:28:16.481 --> 02:28:20.190
Have you heard about what happened in Ohio?
No.
Speaking of a gang rapes,

2666
02:28:20.220 --> 02:28:22.040
there's a,
there was a high school gang

2667
02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:26.500
<v 1>rape with these guys,
drugged up this girl,
this one guy,
um,</v>

2668
02:28:26.540 --> 02:28:30.340
apparently the girl broke up with him so he's like a no whore breaks up with me

2669
02:28:30.341 --> 02:28:32.120
and like put it on his Twitter.
Right.

2670
02:28:32.121 --> 02:28:34.610
And like they put like really horrific shit on her Twitter.

2671
02:28:34.910 --> 02:28:38.150
These high school football kids and they would go around,

2672
02:28:38.151 --> 02:28:40.910
they called themselves the rape grew.
That's what everybody called them.

2673
02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:44.770
Nice guys.
And they would drug girls and gang rape,
bumped cheese.

2674
02:28:44.870 --> 02:28:47.000
And they took this girl,
this guy's girlfriend,

2675
02:28:47.240 --> 02:28:50.960
they drugged her up and they took her to several parties.
Not One,

2676
02:28:50.961 --> 02:28:54.670
but several parties.
She's completely unconscious and they fucked her.

2677
02:28:55.010 --> 02:28:59.390
And then they made a video and this is all anonymous bringing all the shit out

2678
02:28:59.391 --> 02:29:02.870
because they found out there was a big cover up in this town because this is a

2679
02:29:03.240 --> 02:29:06.250
you,
we talked about that,
the area of the town where it was,
yeah.

2680
02:29:06.590 --> 02:29:09.800
What was it was the areas,
Steubenville,
Steubenville,
well,

2681
02:29:09.801 --> 02:29:14.090
there's a video and in the video that they just released,

2682
02:29:14.150 --> 02:29:19.010
these kids are bragging about the rape and about how dead the girl was while

2683
02:29:19.011 --> 02:29:21.770
they were fucking her in her butt and she had it like she was,

2684
02:29:21.980 --> 02:29:24.320
she was dead or the no js while she was dead.
And he's,

2685
02:29:24.560 --> 02:29:28.220
he jokes about it for 10 15 minutes fucking piece of shit.

2686
02:29:28.250 --> 02:29:29.960
You got to pull the video up because it'll,
it'll,

2687
02:29:29.961 --> 02:29:34.940
it'll shock you when you find out that this was about a gang rape and then you

2688
02:29:34.941 --> 02:29:38.570
see these guys doing this.
It's going to,
well they're,

2689
02:29:38.571 --> 02:29:41.720
they're done for the rest of their life.
Good Joe.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.
Definitely.

2690
02:29:41.780 --> 02:29:45.860
Luck getting a job now.
You fucking did it.
Definitely.
But split.
It's also like,

2691
02:29:45.861 --> 02:29:49.230
like I did crazy shit as a kid.
I never let that,
that,
that's just a d.

2692
02:29:49.280 --> 02:29:53.510
That's just the definition of a fucking asshole.
Yeah.
Just a bad human being.

2693
02:29:54.340 --> 02:29:59.000
Just a shoe,
a bad egg.
Like a dirty,
a d,
a sick dog.
It's,
it's one of the,

2694
02:29:59.030 --> 02:30:00.950
one of the darkest shit.
It makes me sick.

2695
02:30:01.100 --> 02:30:05.090
It's one of the darkest things I've ever seen in my life.
Man.
It's really hard.

2696
02:30:05.510 --> 02:30:09.200
It's a,
it's really hard to watch.
Um,
this,
uh,

2697
02:30:09.740 --> 02:30:13.130
this kid was just like sitting there with his buddies,

2698
02:30:13.131 --> 02:30:17.840
just joking back and forth and laughing,
you know,

2699
02:30:19.610 --> 02:30:23.960
it's um,
yeah,
it's bad.
It's just hard to imagine.
It might not be up anymore.

2700
02:30:24.110 --> 02:30:28.490
You'll 17 year old boy.
No,
no,
it's there.

2701
02:30:28.491 --> 02:30:31.670
It's still there.
Pull up,
uh,
Ohio state,

2702
02:30:31.790 --> 02:30:36.680
Ohio high school students joking about.
Yeah,
I got it.

2703
02:30:36.800 --> 02:30:38.720
Gang rape.
Yeah.

2704
02:30:39.040 --> 02:30:43.800
<v 7>Oh.
Bernese.
I Logan said a cell phone leads last week by hacktivist group.</v>

2705
02:30:43.801 --> 02:30:47.130
Anonymous has added fuel to the fire surrounding an alleged rape in,

2706
02:30:47.131 --> 02:30:48.120
in Ohio town.

2707
02:30:48.270 --> 02:30:51.930
A group of high school football players is accused of raping and kidnapping.

2708
02:30:51.931 --> 02:30:55.920
A 16 year old girl who was allegedly drugged,
taking a numerous parties,

2709
02:30:55.921 --> 02:30:58.320
assaulted and urinated on last August.

2710
02:30:58.500 --> 02:31:01.980
Now a new piece of evidence in the case shows the teens laughing and joking

2711
02:31:01.981 --> 02:31:05.790
about the alleged events.
And we must warn you,
it might make you uncomfortable.

2712
02:31:08.610 --> 02:31:10.160
<v 8>She's bored,
she's dead,
or</v>

2713
02:31:12.110 --> 02:31:16.520
he raped her harder than that comp rate.
Marcellus wall.
And a simple fix.

2714
02:31:17.670 --> 02:31:21.030
<v 7>The video was allegedly posted youtube the night of the incident along with</v>

2715
02:31:21.031 --> 02:31:24.390
Twitter posts and pictures taken by those who were at the parties where the girl

2716
02:31:24.391 --> 02:31:25.230
was being dragged.

2717
02:31:25.590 --> 02:31:29.220
The Daily Mail explained to the Ohio town is torn by the case with some

2718
02:31:29.221 --> 02:31:32.490
supporting the girl in her accusations and others taking the sides of the

2719
02:31:32.491 --> 02:31:36.630
players claiming she made up the horrific events to hurt the football program so

2720
02:31:36.631 --> 02:31:37.740
far.
Two football players,

2721
02:31:41.640 --> 02:31:44.730
<v 1>that's not bad for their reputation at all to say that you've been</v>

2722
02:31:45.200 --> 02:31:48.590
<v 2>yeah and urinated on and,
and,
and then you get the guys bragging about it.</v>

2723
02:31:49.180 --> 02:31:52.540
<v 1>Here's
what we do this though,</v>

2724
02:31:52.541 --> 02:31:54.950
but it's an important point that we had talked about before Brian,

2725
02:31:54.980 --> 02:31:59.640
about that like anonymous is like the person who's,
I mean they are the,

2726
02:31:59.641 --> 02:32:02.600
the real group with morals and again,

2727
02:32:02.601 --> 02:32:04.760
they're proving this mean this is,

2728
02:32:05.630 --> 02:32:07.790
they go after shit man.

2729
02:32:07.791 --> 02:32:10.220
When they find out that someone did something fucked up like this,

2730
02:32:10.340 --> 02:32:13.190
it was some chick that drown a bunch of puppies and threw him in the river.

2731
02:32:13.340 --> 02:32:16.280
They found out who that fucking bitch was.
They went after her.

2732
02:32:16.310 --> 02:32:19.250
They found out who she was.
They put all of her information online.

2733
02:32:19.251 --> 02:32:22.640
They contacted the police and this the same thing with this.

2734
02:32:22.720 --> 02:32:25.760
These all these videos are coming out because of anonymous,
you know,

2735
02:32:25.761 --> 02:32:28.190
and there's a lot of people that don't want to get behind an anonymous.

2736
02:32:28.191 --> 02:32:33.191
They think they're vigilantes when justice is not being done through traditional

2737
02:32:33.261 --> 02:32:38.120
methods,
isn't it someone's fucking responsibility who has power to do something?

2738
02:32:38.480 --> 02:32:41.960
They're doing the the job of a,
of the police.

2739
02:32:41.961 --> 02:32:45.320
They're doing the job of someone who looks after citizens.
You are,

2740
02:32:45.321 --> 02:32:46.430
you have a daughter,
man.

2741
02:32:46.610 --> 02:32:49.340
Could you imagine if this is your daughter and you have to find out about this

2742
02:32:49.341 --> 02:32:53.750
this way?
I'd fucking have to go buy myself a machine.
It's unbelievably sick,

2743
02:32:53.751 --> 02:32:57.080
but this is being glossed over by this fucking town.

2744
02:32:57.260 --> 02:32:59.540
If you look into the story behind it,

2745
02:32:59.810 --> 02:33:02.930
I looked into it even more after we talked about it and just read all the shit

2746
02:33:02.931 --> 02:33:04.640
and then watch this video and I like this is,

2747
02:33:04.810 --> 02:33:08.630
I don't understand how you gloss over a fucking like something like that because

2748
02:33:08.631 --> 02:33:12.290
it's financially,
financially,
how much money?
It's devastating.

2749
02:33:12.470 --> 02:33:13.910
<v 2>That's happening.
It's like,
it's like when,</v>

2750
02:33:13.911 --> 02:33:17.120
when those guys knew that he was fucking young guys,
here's what you do,

2751
02:33:17.121 --> 02:33:19.130
young boys,
when you find out somebody,

2752
02:33:19.131 --> 02:33:22.310
when you see somebody fucking a 10 year old or whatever,
it wasn't that shower.

2753
02:33:22.311 --> 02:33:24.230
I don't know how old the kid was you.

2754
02:33:24.280 --> 02:33:28.250
You put a towel around the kid and then you go right to the fucking cops.

2755
02:33:28.370 --> 02:33:32.740
You turn that guy in it.
Fuck your football program there.

2756
02:33:32.741 --> 02:33:37.130
There is a point where we're things,
stop where you go.
It's called game over.

2757
02:33:37.131 --> 02:33:42.130
You Go,
hold on.
I,
it doesn't matter what that nothing else matters.
Don't go,
Yay,

2758
02:33:42.160 --> 02:33:43.970
they,
he raped a kid.
But you can't.
There's no,

2759
02:33:44.070 --> 02:33:48.990
<v 1>but after that.
But what is making,
what does making boys willing to do that?</v>

2760
02:33:49.140 --> 02:33:50.640
I was never willing to do that when I was,

2761
02:33:50.740 --> 02:33:54.920
<v 2>he,
it's mob mentality with one bad egg and a bunch of weak kids or just to get</v>

2762
02:33:54.930 --> 02:33:57.390
boys.
You don't know what they're doing.
I don't know the difference.

2763
02:33:57.391 --> 02:34:00.360
They don't they,
it's like it's camaraderie and they,
they,
they're,

2764
02:34:00.361 --> 02:34:04.290
they're fucking and aggression and they haven't yet processed because they're

2765
02:34:04.291 --> 02:34:05.630
boys and they,
they,
they had,

2766
02:34:05.640 --> 02:34:08.850
their brain isn't completely teenagers do crazy shit.
He's in.

2767
02:34:09.450 --> 02:34:10.860
<v 1>Is there an argument that this,</v>

2768
02:34:10.861 --> 02:34:15.840
there's a a like a meathead jock mentality that's cultivating.

2769
02:34:15.890 --> 02:34:17.800
I don't know that it's,
I don't know that sports

2770
02:34:18.040 --> 02:34:22.030
<v 3>cause you to do that.
I think it's just,
it's,
it's usually a couple,
one,
two,</v>

2771
02:34:22.031 --> 02:34:27.031
three really bad kids are just shitty people who are too fucking dumb or too

2772
02:34:29.050 --> 02:34:29.920
aggressive too.

2773
02:34:29.921 --> 02:34:33.490
They want them to be super aggressive and super acid fighters that are make for

2774
02:34:33.491 --> 02:34:37.330
better,
better football players.
The more aggressively go out and take it.

2775
02:34:37.331 --> 02:34:39.250
If they're like real sweet and kind,

2776
02:34:39.370 --> 02:34:41.710
they're not going to play crazy violent football boys.

2777
02:34:41.711 --> 02:34:46.450
They found young teenagers.
The reason that young somebody said,

2778
02:34:46.451 --> 02:34:47.170
if you put,

2779
02:34:47.170 --> 02:34:52.170
if you took every teenage boy from the age of like 14 to 21 and put them in

2780
02:34:52.451 --> 02:34:56.450
jail,
we'd have zero crime in this country.
Is the idea is that when,
when they're,

2781
02:34:56.620 --> 02:35:00.820
when a male brain is forming your,
you deal mainly with the frontal Cortex,
right?

2782
02:35:00.821 --> 02:35:03.070
Not In the middle brand,
in the back brain,
whatever it is.
I can't remember.

2783
02:35:03.071 --> 02:35:06.460
That's not true.
That's the idea.
The idea of being that the idea is crazy.

2784
02:35:06.490 --> 02:35:11.200
Who are,
the idea is they're impulsive,
they're fucking,
they're hyper aggressive.

2785
02:35:11.230 --> 02:35:13.000
You know,
there's certainly that.

2786
02:35:13.030 --> 02:35:16.800
But what I'm saying is that in that sort of culture,
that's,
look,
man,

2787
02:35:16.900 --> 02:35:19.120
there's a cultivated sort of an attitude about,

2788
02:35:19.150 --> 02:35:20.530
I'm not saying that encourages rape,

2789
02:35:20.740 --> 02:35:24.310
but I'm saying that when you have a bunch of kids that,

2790
02:35:24.311 --> 02:35:27.400
and they're not getting the proper guidance and they're encouraged to be crazy

2791
02:35:27.401 --> 02:35:31.540
and aggressive.
I was,
I was,
I'm aggressive.
I was crazy aggressive.

2792
02:35:31.541 --> 02:35:34.180
I've always been an aggressive person.
I mean,
I,
I'm,

2793
02:35:34.220 --> 02:35:36.280
I'm as aggressive as anybody as a teenager.

2794
02:35:36.820 --> 02:35:41.820
I never in a million years would have been gang raped or establish that.

2795
02:35:42.310 --> 02:35:46.950
Why?
So why is it that they can go and I think typically it's just,
uh,

2796
02:35:47.130 --> 02:35:51.530
uh,
usually,
uh,
uh,
whatever you want to call it.
A bad kid.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no.

2797
02:35:51.531 --> 02:35:55.210
I can't just be one kid.
It's not,
there's no group.
It's probably a group.
But I'm,

2798
02:35:55.230 --> 02:35:58.240
why are you saying that it's one kid that starts this fire and then everyone

2799
02:35:58.241 --> 02:36:02.220
else's catches fire,
I guess crazy real leader in a group of bad guy in the,

2800
02:36:02.221 --> 02:36:06.480
in the group.
My,
my guess is that's usually how boys delineate authority.

2801
02:36:06.481 --> 02:36:10.360
There's always one alpha male,
you know,
that's interesting.
And this,
uh,

2802
02:36:10.361 --> 02:36:11.950
in this situation,
I,
you know,

2803
02:36:11.951 --> 02:36:14.890
I have a feeling that they're sort of a detachment that they all sort of

2804
02:36:15.580 --> 02:36:18.910
cultivate,
you know,
that this,
uh,
I agree,
this angry,

2805
02:36:18.911 --> 02:36:23.230
aggressive detachment and some of that has to do with the ideas behind kicking

2806
02:36:23.231 --> 02:36:26.020
people's asses and going out and being successful in,

2807
02:36:26.260 --> 02:36:29.950
especially someone that's something as detached as like football or it's sort of

2808
02:36:29.951 --> 02:36:32.230
violent,
but it's violent.
This sort of weird,

2809
02:36:32.231 --> 02:36:36.130
tricky way where you're allowed to like run into each other and fuck them up
and,

2810
02:36:36.340 --> 02:36:38.490
but you're not really fighting,
you know?
So there's no,
there's,

2811
02:36:38.491 --> 02:36:43.340
there's not the same Marshall discipline and the things that are involved in,

2812
02:36:43.341 --> 02:36:46.240
in,
in competing in that sort of one on one endeavor.

2813
02:36:46.360 --> 02:36:48.970
It's a different sort of group in town.
The Capstone Sports,

2814
02:36:49.830 --> 02:36:52.480
cause I think you have a lot of cut a lot of places that those men in India,

2815
02:36:52.481 --> 02:36:53.350
I'd never played football.

2816
02:36:53.351 --> 02:36:56.140
I probably never played sports and they would probably getting raped themselves

2817
02:36:56.141 --> 02:36:59.800
too though.
I mean,
you know,
you're dealing with a lot of it in those situations.

2818
02:36:59.801 --> 02:37:03.640
You're dealing in incredibly impoverished places.
Happens to men too.

2819
02:37:03.641 --> 02:37:07.690
When you have one strong leader and,
and some bad people involved,

2820
02:37:07.691 --> 02:37:11.740
then you have a couple of guys that want to be included and be cool and they're

2821
02:37:11.860 --> 02:37:16.010
dorks and they,
you know,
I don't know.
It's just how someone raise a

2822
02:37:16.010 --> 02:37:19.040
<v 1>son that's capable of doing that to a girl.
I mean,</v>

2823
02:37:19.041 --> 02:37:21.710
is it growing up without sisters or the,
you know,

2824
02:37:21.820 --> 02:37:26.740
<v 2>maybe not having the love for your mother or not realizing that girls are the</v>

2825
02:37:26.741 --> 02:37:30.190
same and are maybe subhuman some way?

2826
02:37:30.250 --> 02:37:33.910
<v 1>Well,
I'm hoping that like the Neat Delhi thing that what you're dealing with in</v>

2827
02:37:33.940 --> 02:37:36.700
Steubenville,
Ohio,
wherever the fuck it is,

2828
02:37:36.910 --> 02:37:40.450
is you're dealing with a bunch of backwards ass holes that aren't getting the

2829
02:37:40.451 --> 02:37:41.920
full version of the world yet.

2830
02:37:41.980 --> 02:37:45.400
And that because of this and because of what anonymous has done and expose all

2831
02:37:45.401 --> 02:37:49.300
this,
that it's gonna make that impossible to ever happen again.

2832
02:37:49.301 --> 02:37:52.450
And the kids are going to be aware of that shit and the family's going to be

2833
02:37:52.451 --> 02:37:54.400
aware of that shit and no one's going to be,

2834
02:37:54.430 --> 02:37:56.680
no one's ever going to try to pull anything on it that off again.

2835
02:37:56.681 --> 02:37:58.150
Cause he didn't know they can't.
I hope so.

2836
02:37:58.440 --> 02:38:01.860
<v 2>I do think that when you do that,
what those guys did to that girl,</v>

2837
02:38:02.190 --> 02:38:05.610
I think it's very similar to what those guys would do to another guy with a

2838
02:38:05.611 --> 02:38:09.780
baseball bat.
They would soon to anybody.
Yeah,
it's fine.
It's an act of violence.

2839
02:38:09.781 --> 02:38:11.370
So,
so whether it's the girls,

2840
02:38:11.371 --> 02:38:14.460
the target or some guy walking down the street who's a different color or

2841
02:38:14.461 --> 02:38:15.360
wearing a weird shirt,

2842
02:38:16.260 --> 02:38:21.260
that mob mentality with young guys happens a lot has always happened.

2843
02:38:22.350 --> 02:38:22.940
It's the same.

2844
02:38:22.940 --> 02:38:26.240
<v 1>The thing that allows someone to beat someone to death from because they're</v>

2845
02:38:26.241 --> 02:38:29.630
wearing a jersey from the wrong teams.
Like that guy in la,

2846
02:38:29.730 --> 02:38:32.990
that's a tribal thing and almost to death,
it is almost the same thing.

2847
02:38:32.991 --> 02:38:36.500
It's like we're all together against everybody else.
Where do you get fucker?
But,

2848
02:38:36.710 --> 02:38:40.460
and it's almost like the way you prove that you're with the group is to engage

2849
02:38:40.461 --> 02:38:43.670
in these immoral activities that you would never do to someone who is a member

2850
02:38:43.671 --> 02:38:44.190
of the group.

2851
02:38:44.190 --> 02:38:47.870
<v 2>You're trying to one up each other.
I factor in the air looking at Ip dot.</v>

2852
02:38:48.510 --> 02:38:51.940
So crazy bro.
Pissed at her butt,
right?
Yeah.

2853
02:38:51.990 --> 02:38:54.930
It's fucking not to hear those stories when you were younger.

2854
02:38:54.931 --> 02:38:56.460
I remember my buddy was like,
dude.

2855
02:38:56.760 --> 02:39:00.440
And John went to New York and he had sex with this dual ochre and he was banging

2856
02:39:00.441 --> 02:39:02.480
her in the ass and we could have here going Ah,

2857
02:39:02.481 --> 02:39:04.540
and handed out laughing and I was like looking at him going on.

2858
02:39:04.550 --> 02:39:06.140
I don't know if that's that funny dude.
I don't feel,

2859
02:39:06.150 --> 02:39:07.620
I kinda feel bad for that girl.

2860
02:39:08.960 --> 02:39:12.240
I just think a lot of times it can also be like a level of compassion.

2861
02:39:12.241 --> 02:39:15.560
You're either born with it sometimes or other people don't have the ability to,

2862
02:39:15.710 --> 02:39:18.750
to have empathy as much empathy with somebody else.

2863
02:39:18.830 --> 02:39:22.100
<v 1>It's also those formative years too.
It's really terrifying about that kid.</v>

2864
02:39:22.101 --> 02:39:25.430
And that video was laughing and bragging about the girl getting raped.

2865
02:39:25.790 --> 02:39:28.010
What's really terrifying is that same,

2866
02:39:28.220 --> 02:39:33.020
that same boy could easily be put in Afghanistan and given a gun.

2867
02:39:35.370 --> 02:39:37.840
<v 2>Fuck you doing man.
Sorry.
Yeah.</v>

2868
02:39:39.440 --> 02:39:42.670
<v 1>What are you trying to do man?
I didn't do that on purpose.
The um,</v>

2869
02:39:43.380 --> 02:39:45.140
that could have been easily,
you know,

2870
02:39:45.141 --> 02:39:48.650
like that one guy who wound up going fucking crazy and gun down.

2871
02:39:48.651 --> 02:39:50.510
A bunch of people had been there forever.

2872
02:39:51.160 --> 02:39:55.360
<v 2>The other thing is that same boy may with the right guidance have been putting</v>

2873
02:39:55.361 --> 02:39:59.080
all that aggression into something productive.
The,

2874
02:39:59.330 --> 02:40:03.430
when you look at that kid right now at 17 his life has done,
I don't think,

2875
02:40:03.460 --> 02:40:05.920
I don't,
how do you,
how do you come away with,
you know,

2876
02:40:05.950 --> 02:40:09.760
I guess when he's 30 or 40 you know,
things wash away,

2877
02:40:09.761 --> 02:40:13.560
but for that he's going to be brought up on charges,
rape

2878
02:40:13.980 --> 02:40:18.980
<v 3>and your life is pretty much at that point going to take a major turn and most</v>

2879
02:40:19.441 --> 02:40:23.970
likely the amount of public pressure that's going to be on trying these guys as

2880
02:40:23.971 --> 02:40:26.850
adults is going to be huge.
You're not,
they're not.

2881
02:40:26.910 --> 02:40:29.730
No one's going to want them to get away with this.
They're laughing about this.

2882
02:40:29.731 --> 02:40:32.050
They gonna want to send a message.
Hey,
yeah.

2883
02:40:32.280 --> 02:40:36.240
It's like we got to figure out a way to stop the competition.

2884
02:40:36.270 --> 02:40:41.270
Like this idea that there's an us and them in society and whether it's an us and

2885
02:40:41.671 --> 02:40:45.960
them,
whether it's Ohio people,
Shit on Kentucky,
people are,

2886
02:40:45.961 --> 02:40:49.440
it's men that should on women or gays or shit on straights or blacks against

2887
02:40:49.441 --> 02:40:52.460
whites.
We have this division,
this arm,

2888
02:40:52.700 --> 02:40:57.390
so sort of like clan mentality gone wrong division in,
in,

2889
02:40:57.391 --> 02:41:02.391
in human beings where we're willing to do fucked up shit to certain groups.

2890
02:41:03.390 --> 02:41:08.280
If we decide there the Taliban or we decide they're the enemy or their fags or

2891
02:41:08.281 --> 02:41:12.450
they're girls,
they're bitches or their blacks or whatever,

2892
02:41:12.650 --> 02:41:15.810
I would suggest that it's getting better,
not worse.

2893
02:41:15.811 --> 02:41:19.380
And I would suggest the world has less brutal in that regard than it used to be.

2894
02:41:19.590 --> 02:41:23.760
And the reason I say that is because there are eyes on it and it's becoming

2895
02:41:23.761 --> 02:41:28.761
easier and easier to identify and understand how similar you are to those people

2896
02:41:31.051 --> 02:41:34.020
over there.
Those people over there also have the internet.

2897
02:41:34.021 --> 02:41:36.150
Those people over there speak a common language.

2898
02:41:36.360 --> 02:41:41.190
I'm being offered standup gigs in Dubai and in Lebanon and in south.

2899
02:41:41.191 --> 02:41:42.810
I suggest you not take it.
I'm not going to,

2900
02:41:42.811 --> 02:41:45.940
I'm just saying that put your ass in jail.
I'm just,
I'm just saying that,

2901
02:41:45.960 --> 02:41:49.140
that it's interesting that you have people there that want to laugh too

2902
02:41:49.141 --> 02:41:52.350
sometimes at the same stuff we are connecting.
We are,

2903
02:41:52.530 --> 02:41:54.510
we are developing a neuro consciousness.
I mean,

2904
02:41:54.511 --> 02:41:56.880
I don't know how long it's going to take,
but it feels that we are,

2905
02:41:56.881 --> 02:42:01.410
like I said before,
being nudged in the same direction toward each other.

2906
02:42:01.700 --> 02:42:05.490
Eh,
having virtual experiences,
almost of what it's like to be each other,

2907
02:42:05.491 --> 02:42:07.360
that's becoming easier than it is.

2908
02:42:07.370 --> 02:42:11.550
It scares me the most about that kid is what made that kid could that have been

2909
02:42:11.551 --> 02:42:15.000
me if I grew up in that kid's household?
If I had that Kid's dad,

2910
02:42:15.001 --> 02:42:18.030
if I had that kid's mom and that kids brothers and I lived in that kid's town,

2911
02:42:18.330 --> 02:42:22.180
would I be him?
That's a good question.
It's an absolute real question.
You know,

2912
02:42:22.250 --> 02:42:24.180
drunk.
You're trying to,
you're,
you don't,

2913
02:42:24.181 --> 02:42:27.650
you're not looking at the girl as a human being.
She's drunk.
She's passed out.

2914
02:42:27.670 --> 02:42:29.700
You're just going to have sex with her because he,
it's not hurting her.

2915
02:42:29.700 --> 02:42:32.730
It's all that stuff.
You know,
you're 17 you're a fucking retard.

2916
02:42:32.760 --> 02:42:33.750
There's a part in my act,

2917
02:42:33.790 --> 02:42:38.640
what's the true story where I talk about being on a boat and being,
I was really,

2918
02:42:38.641 --> 02:42:42.210
really high and these dolphins were playing next to the boat and through this

2919
02:42:42.211 --> 02:42:44.640
law,
I won't give you the whole bit,

2920
02:42:44.641 --> 02:42:49.641
but I realized something that it's very possible that everybody is exactly the

2921
02:42:52.351 --> 02:42:53.790
same at the core,

2922
02:42:53.880 --> 02:42:57.450
but we're just live in these different existences with different biologies and

2923
02:42:57.451 --> 02:43:02.370
different personalities and different sexual needs and wants and different life

2924
02:43:02.371 --> 02:43:03.091
experiences.

2925
02:43:03.091 --> 02:43:08.091
And I thought about it and I thought like one of the best ways to treat people

2926
02:43:08.760 --> 02:43:12.160
is to treat people as if they're you living another life.
If every

2927
02:43:12.160 --> 02:43:16.090
<v 1>person you run into literally is you living another life,
if you live my life,</v>

2928
02:43:16.091 --> 02:43:20.410
you would be me.
And if I lived your life,
you,
you know,
if I lived your life,

2929
02:43:20.411 --> 02:43:23.320
I would be here.
I would be,
I would be you and every exact I've,
I've,

2930
02:43:23.440 --> 02:43:25.930
I would have your experiences in your jeans and your,

2931
02:43:26.930 --> 02:43:30.520
and if we could get people to somehow or another consider that.

2932
02:43:30.521 --> 02:43:33.790
That would be like the greatest idea for religion ever.

2933
02:43:34.030 --> 02:43:37.590
Instead of a religion based on the idea that there's some crazy motherfucker

2934
02:43:37.600 --> 02:43:41.410
that brings people back from the dead and turns water into wine and if you eat

2935
02:43:41.411 --> 02:43:44.230
the wrong fruit,
you're fucked instead of that guy.

2936
02:43:44.770 --> 02:43:49.770
How about the idea that all of us are the same and we really could get so much

2937
02:43:51.101 --> 02:43:51.934
more done?

2938
02:43:52.320 --> 02:43:54.840
<v 2>One of the tenants of Christianity I think is interesting is that,</v>

2939
02:43:54.841 --> 02:43:56.010
and one of the main tenants,

2940
02:43:56.280 --> 02:43:59.550
well one of the things that Christ said is all you have to do is do unto others

2941
02:43:59.551 --> 02:44:03.120
as you'd have them do unto you.
Yes,
that was,
he said if you do that,
if you hold,

2942
02:44:03.121 --> 02:44:05.180
if you will,
that's abstract.
It's treat them right

2943
02:44:05.240 --> 02:44:08.070
<v 1>as you would like them to treat you.
What I'm saying is a,</v>

2944
02:44:08.071 --> 02:44:12.260
treat them as if they were you.
If that,
if it was you living another life,

2945
02:44:12.290 --> 02:44:16.940
if we really are all one than I am you and you are me and it sounds hippy as

2946
02:44:16.941 --> 02:44:20.000
fuck.
But if people could figure out how to think like that,

2947
02:44:20.001 --> 02:44:23.780
I think that would be the real life changer.
That would be the real game changer.

2948
02:44:23.810 --> 02:44:28.810
And it could happen and that also would get rid of all the fuck you was.

2949
02:44:29.900 --> 02:44:32.270
All the fuck heads would be held accountable the same way you're held

2950
02:44:32.271 --> 02:44:34.220
accountable,
which is like when I was saying about that video,

2951
02:44:34.221 --> 02:44:38.630
one of the things that disturbs me the most is I know that I am a flawed human

2952
02:44:38.631 --> 02:44:41.730
being and especially at times in my life when I was younger,
I've,
I've,

2953
02:44:41.740 --> 02:44:46.740
I've been capable of doing crazy things that were regrettable and that I got

2954
02:44:46.791 --> 02:44:48.230
through it without doing anything like that.

2955
02:44:48.260 --> 02:44:52.100
I got through life without committing any felonies or doing any horrible crimes,

2956
02:44:52.310 --> 02:44:56.080
but that's just lucky.
I could have been in the wrong environment

2957
02:44:56.190 --> 02:44:57.480
<v 2>know,
I was just thinking the other day,</v>

2958
02:44:57.730 --> 02:45:00.900
I remember hitting somebody in her face as hard as I could.
I was in a fight.

2959
02:45:01.380 --> 02:45:05.420
I really believe that in that moment I was trying to kill that guy.
You know?

2960
02:45:05.490 --> 02:45:08.340
I was trying like when you hit somebody in the face because you're angry at them

2961
02:45:08.341 --> 02:45:11.290
in a real fight and you hit him in like you were in a bar or whatever new hit

2962
02:45:11.291 --> 02:45:14.460
him,
you're trying to fuck,
I'm so angry I'm trying to kill that fucking dude.

2963
02:45:14.461 --> 02:45:17.700
Right.
And they go down.
You stomp them with your exact same,

2964
02:45:17.701 --> 02:45:20.400
it's exactly the same mindset.

2965
02:45:20.401 --> 02:45:23.110
I just got away with it cause I didn't pumps that hard.
Right.
You know I gave,

2966
02:45:23.130 --> 02:45:27.810
I hit him in my hands,
I got girl hands but,
but that's that is that is the,

2967
02:45:28.140 --> 02:45:29.640
we have all made decisions,

2968
02:45:29.641 --> 02:45:33.240
split second decisions through anger or whatever that could have landed us,

2969
02:45:33.241 --> 02:45:35.370
could have changed our lives in a very,
very different way.

2970
02:45:35.590 --> 02:45:36.840
And it's a question about,
that

2971
02:45:37.400 --> 02:45:40.640
<v 1>seems to me that a big part of this conversation,</v>

2972
02:45:40.641 --> 02:45:45.470
a big part of the issue of like what would allow a person to be to dehumanize a

2973
02:45:45.471 --> 02:45:46.304
girl like that.

2974
02:45:46.340 --> 02:45:51.340
What would allow a person to to be a serial killer or a school shooter or any of

2975
02:45:51.831 --> 02:45:56.420
that.
It all goes down to the heart of the matter,

2976
02:45:56.510 --> 02:46:01.510
which is trying to figure out how to get people to respect and treat other

2977
02:46:01.911 --> 02:46:06.740
people in a better way.
Saying locally,
one of the guys with their ex too,

2978
02:46:06.770 --> 02:46:09.980
so that's something that was what I said,
that guy,
he said,

2979
02:46:09.980 --> 02:46:13.430
<v 3>no bitch breaks up with me,
so he got a draw.
There are two things to think about.</v>

2980
02:46:13.431 --> 02:46:17.750
Also,
I also think you'd have to make an account for the fact that first of all,

2981
02:46:17.780 --> 02:46:19.540
these events,
the reason you read about them,

2982
02:46:19.550 --> 02:46:22.640
we talk about them is because in the grand scheme of things,
they're fairly rare,

2983
02:46:22.641 --> 02:46:25.550
right?
When it makes the news,
so it's let,
thank God it's an aberration.

2984
02:46:25.551 --> 02:46:27.590
It's a rarity.
We heard.
Did you hear about this?
No,

2985
02:46:27.591 --> 02:46:29.990
that I don't hear about that every day.
That's part of the thing,

2986
02:46:30.230 --> 02:46:33.780
but I also think that I really believe that the majority of people are,

2987
02:46:33.781 --> 02:46:37.400
are good people and kind of do what you say and then the,

2988
02:46:37.401 --> 02:46:40.580
it just takes a small fucking handful.

2989
02:46:40.820 --> 02:46:45.410
It takes a tiny fraction of the population to ruin it for the rest of us.

2990
02:46:45.411 --> 02:46:48.860
Think you said something really important earlier will that people can get used

2991
02:46:48.861 --> 02:46:51.830
to almost anything.
You know,
and I think that's what it is.

2992
02:46:52.010 --> 02:46:56.060
Like this idea that people can get used to horrific conditions.

2993
02:46:56.330 --> 02:46:59.360
They can get used to a lot of fucked up that can each get used to eat and fly

2994
02:46:59.361 --> 02:47:03.080
burgers.
You can also use to gang run.
You can also,
because of technology,

2995
02:47:03.081 --> 02:47:06.200
isolate yourself from the rest of the world more than you've ever been able to.

2996
02:47:06.500 --> 02:47:08.420
You can live a virtual existence.

2997
02:47:08.450 --> 02:47:13.370
You can be a young man who sits in his room all day and his only friend is the

2998
02:47:13.371 --> 02:47:16.970
internet and video games.
I don't know that that creates a killer of course,

2999
02:47:16.971 --> 02:47:20.840
but I do think we live in a world where you can certainly isolate yourself into

3000
02:47:20.841 --> 02:47:25.610
a virtual reality where you start to believe the virtual is actual and so now

3001
02:47:25.720 --> 02:47:28.070
when you're playing video games all day,
it's just an example.

3002
02:47:28.190 --> 02:47:30.590
Now human beings a target because you haven't had any,

3003
02:47:30.680 --> 02:47:32.720
you haven't had any interaction with a human being.

3004
02:47:32.900 --> 02:47:36.740
It's like Malcolm Gladwell's book where as soon as the Bronx stopped being small

3005
02:47:36.741 --> 02:47:40.190
houses where everybody knew each other and they built these huge structures

3006
02:47:40.191 --> 02:47:43.280
where everybody was anonymous.
It was much easier to kill somebody to know him.

3007
02:47:43.520 --> 02:47:45.560
He didn't know who they were.
There wasn't a connection there.

3008
02:47:45.860 --> 02:47:49.160
And so in some ways technology is bringing us together in other ways.

3009
02:47:49.161 --> 02:47:52.670
Some people are being left out so that they are completely disconnected and

3010
02:47:52.671 --> 02:47:56.840
their only connection is a virtual connection.
Yeah.
Well as virtual,
uh,

3011
02:47:57.050 --> 02:47:58.880
technology gets better,

3012
02:47:58.970 --> 02:48:03.970
then it becomes even weirder because then the temptation to enter into virtual

3013
02:48:04.401 --> 02:48:07.730
realms,
they're going to be more and more satisfying.
Rewarding.

3014
02:48:07.960 --> 02:48:12.830
So in the same way where it's almost like a race between these two forces,

3015
02:48:13.010 --> 02:48:14.690
that connective force of the Internet,

3016
02:48:14.930 --> 02:48:17.990
the ability to bring people together through information and through social

3017
02:48:17.991 --> 02:48:20.750
media and then the virtual possibilities,

3018
02:48:20.900 --> 02:48:23.980
the possibilities of living into what life of world of Warcraft and,

3019
02:48:24.670 --> 02:48:26.700
and call of duty,
you know,

3020
02:48:26.701 --> 02:48:31.070
and the idea that that can somehow or another change someone's view on

3021
02:48:31.071 --> 02:48:34.280
interacting with people because the way they interact with people on this

3022
02:48:34.281 --> 02:48:35.790
fucking case,
killing them all the time,

3023
02:48:35.930 --> 02:48:37.760
that's what they're doing like all the time,
right.

3024
02:48:37.980 --> 02:48:42.380
That those two forces are kind of duking it out to see like it becomes your

3025
02:48:42.381 --> 02:48:46.040
reality,
right?
I mean,
it becomes your reality when you do it over and over again.

3026
02:48:46.790 --> 02:48:49.160
Um,
I dunno man.

3027
02:48:49.190 --> 02:48:53.300
I think that when you're not having real connections with human beings,

3028
02:48:53.810 --> 02:48:58.580
it can probably change it.
Some people,
yeah,
we're a,
we're really not fixed yet.

3029
02:48:58.640 --> 02:49:02.120
We're not done.
We're like a work in progress.
These fucking humans,

3030
02:49:02.150 --> 02:49:05.000
but yet people want to keep everything the way it is right now.
I don't know.

3031
02:49:05.001 --> 02:49:08.130
They learned,
the more they learn about the brain.
You know,
the serial

3032
02:49:08.130 --> 02:49:11.610
<v 1>killers,
that guy was ankle.
He goes,
Dexter's never going to make a serial killer.</v>

3033
02:49:11.640 --> 02:49:14.130
Serial killers have different brains.
We know that now.

3034
02:49:14.490 --> 02:49:18.840
So sometimes people just have bad brains,
man.
Yeah,
I mean it's,
it makes sense.

3035
02:49:18.841 --> 02:49:21.300
I mean,
some people have giant dicks.
That's it.
Like me.

3036
02:49:21.360 --> 02:49:23.130
Why wouldn't somebody that's a hindrance sometimes.

3037
02:49:23.700 --> 02:49:26.790
Why wouldn't some people have fucked up brains?
Some people are nymphomaniacs.

3038
02:49:26.791 --> 02:49:30.780
Right?
Brian,
why wouldn't a,
some people fuck you had though?

3039
02:49:30.781 --> 02:49:32.220
Of course it does a lot of things.

3040
02:49:32.280 --> 02:49:35.520
So it was that the guy yesterday that said that,
um,
no,
no,
no.

3041
02:49:35.521 --> 02:49:37.230
He didn't say there wasn't nymphomaniacs what he's saying,

3042
02:49:37.231 --> 02:49:40.700
there's no sex addicts saying the evidence for sex addicts,
they're like,
what?

3043
02:49:40.701 --> 02:49:44.040
What did it,
it's not sex.
It's making you addicted.
It's compulsive behavior.

3044
02:49:44.220 --> 02:49:47.670
And it can manifest itself in playing cards.
It can manifest itself in anything.

3045
02:49:47.670 --> 02:49:50.830
It's just like you have compulsive behavior.
So you're compulsive behaviors.

3046
02:49:50.850 --> 02:49:55.260
Sexual Holla at your boy bitches,
Brian Cowen.

3047
02:49:55.261 --> 02:49:58.300
We'll being appearing.
We'll being appearance.
It was so smooth.

3048
02:49:58.580 --> 02:49:59.413
It's almost like a pro.

3049
02:49:59.640 --> 02:50:03.660
Brian Callen will be appearing at the punchline in San Francisco.

3050
02:50:03.810 --> 02:50:07.080
Not this weekend.
You fuckheads but next weekend,

3051
02:50:07.110 --> 02:50:11.400
I don't know who's there this weekend?
16,
17,
18.
They ain't as funny.
Yeah.

3052
02:50:11.410 --> 02:50:15.660
Fucks.
Okay.
So go see him.
San Francisco,
you bad ass motherfuckers,

3053
02:50:15.780 --> 02:50:18.660
which is one of the greatest cities in the world and it's an awesome place to

3054
02:50:18.661 --> 02:50:21.900
perform as is Pasadena,
where we will be tonight.
Um,

3055
02:50:21.960 --> 02:50:26.750
Eddie if just got added to the show.
So it's Eddie,
ift,
Brian Red Band,

3056
02:50:26.751 --> 02:50:30.570
Sam Tripoli,
Jason t,
Kevin,
Chris,
Kevin,

3057
02:50:30.571 --> 02:50:34.350
Christie,
Greg Fitzsimmons,
Jesus fucking Christ.

3058
02:50:34.351 --> 02:50:37.440
You can't get any better than that dirty fucks.
She's awesome.

3059
02:50:37.500 --> 02:50:39.750
And it's only 15 bucks and then the seats too.

3060
02:50:39.751 --> 02:50:43.710
So it's probably sold out every show and a I'm there next week,

3061
02:50:43.740 --> 02:50:48.510
most likely,
uh,
with Joey Diaz and Ari Shaffir.
If Joey's wife has the little,

3062
02:50:48.540 --> 02:50:52.680
the little noggin.
So a sent Joey out some love.
If not,

3063
02:50:52.681 --> 02:50:55.780
it'd be a,
Ari's going to be working on some new shit and uh,

3064
02:50:55.860 --> 02:51:00.780
that'll be the main room of the ice house next Friday night,
the 11th.

3065
02:51:01.170 --> 02:51:04.590
Um,
thank you everybody for tuning in to podcast as always.

3066
02:51:04.950 --> 02:51:08.040
Thanks for all the love and all the positive messages.

3067
02:51:08.041 --> 02:51:11.340
We appreciate the fuck out of it and all the intriguing tweets that I get.

3068
02:51:11.341 --> 02:51:15.760
I get some fascinating winks.
Um,
really,
really interesting stuff.
And uh,

3069
02:51:15.890 --> 02:51:18.980
I I appreciate the shit out of it.
It's really a,
an awesome thing to,

3070
02:51:19.320 --> 02:51:22.860
to be connected to a,
I don't know how it all happened but uh,

3071
02:51:22.890 --> 02:51:27.180
I am benefiting from it.
We are all benefiting from it as much as you guys are.

3072
02:51:27.181 --> 02:51:31.890
So as much as you say it changed your life,
it helps you.
It changed my life too.

3073
02:51:31.891 --> 02:51:35.660
It's helping me too.
I would never be able to have these long ass conversations.

3074
02:51:35.661 --> 02:51:36.151
Me and Brian,

3075
02:51:36.151 --> 02:51:39.030
like we hang out together more than we've ever hung out before because of this.

3076
02:51:39.160 --> 02:51:41.100
It's hard to do this thing.
It's great.
Greatest thing ever.

3077
02:51:41.310 --> 02:51:43.470
And you can see Brian's podcasts,
you can listen to it.
Rather.

3078
02:51:43.471 --> 02:51:47.380
It's called the Brian Callen show,
perfect name.
And,
uh,

3079
02:51:47.430 --> 02:51:50.870
you can get that shit on iTunes along with the 10 minute podcast,

3080
02:51:50.871 --> 02:51:55.871
which is one of the top three up and coming new podcasts on iTunes.

3081
02:51:57.091 --> 02:52:00.360
It got an award.
We got an award to why Brian?
One of the best,

3082
02:52:00.560 --> 02:52:04.530
best comedy podcasts in Canada too.
You have fucks.
I Love Candy.

3083
02:52:04.531 --> 02:52:08.260
I'm going to Vancouver,

I can't wait.
But when did you add 24th,
25th.

Y'All can be at company makes.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

3085
02:52:11.780 --> 02:52:15.330
That used to be like,
Yep.
Yep.
I love it.
I love Canada.
I love Vancouver.

3086
02:52:15.370 --> 02:52:17.900
Vancouver is one of the guys who sell out too.
It's so fun.

3087
02:52:17.920 --> 02:52:21.540
That's my number one place to bail when the shit hits the Fan America.
Okay.
