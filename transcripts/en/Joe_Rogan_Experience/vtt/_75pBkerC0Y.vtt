<v Speaker 1>I think human nature.</v>

29
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.970
<v Speaker 1>When you're inside of a situation,</v>

30
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.290
<v Speaker 1>like when you have the kind of ultimate control of the people that are in the</v>

31
00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:02.190
<v Speaker 1>head of a government.</v>

32

00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:06.300
<v Speaker 1>anybody that would do,</v>

34
00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.323
<v Speaker 1>and that's like,</v>

35
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.590
<v Speaker 1>you've gotten to this incredible position of ultimate control you can do,</v>

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:07.210
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

238
00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:08.230
<v Speaker 3>somebody pointed this out too.</v>

239
00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.510
<v Speaker 3>Got a lot of new shivs were thing with a lot of podcasts,</v>

240
00:06:10.511 --> 00:06:11.650
<v Speaker 3>people that,</v>

241
00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:12.060
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

242
00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:13.120
<v Speaker 3>And because of that,</v>

243
00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:15.670
<v Speaker 3>the comics who do sort of an honest style of comedy,</v>

244
00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.350
<v Speaker 3>just an open and honest style.</v>

245
00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.370
<v Speaker 3>It's like that this is a premium put on that now and so they've already been</v>

246
00:06:21.371 --> 00:06:21.940
<v Speaker 3>doing it.</v>

247
00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:22.450
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

248

251
00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:25.923
<v Speaker 3>It's very hard</v>

252
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.260
<v Speaker 2>to do that style comedy if that's not what you've been doing.</v>

253
00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.650
<v Speaker 2>If you've been doing a sort of contrived bullshit act,</v>

254
00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:31.990
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

255
00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:33.750
<v Speaker 2>it's very tough to drop that</v>

256
00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.110
<v Speaker 3>be real early on.</v>

257
00:06:35.111 --> 00:06:35.921
<v Speaker 3>It's what everybody does.</v>

258
00:06:35.921 --> 00:06:36.281
<v Speaker 3>It's just like,</v>

259
00:06:36.281 --> 00:06:36.491
<v Speaker 3>let me,</v>

260

269
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.900
<v Speaker 3>this is just to know someone's going to see that something.</v>

270
00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:51.763

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:29.420
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

295
00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:30.780
<v Speaker 3>who the fuck knows?</v>

296
00:07:31.170 --> 00:07:32.130
<v Speaker 3>They might be able to do it.</v>

297
00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:33.300
<v Speaker 3>But realistically,</v>

298
00:07:33.301 --> 00:07:33.880
<v Speaker 3>if you're like,</v>

299
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.450
<v Speaker 3>if I can give you an honest answer without hurting anyone's feelings,</v>

300
00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:37.740
<v Speaker 3>you would have to tell them like,</v>

301
00:07:37.741 --> 00:07:37.921
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

302
00:07:37.921 --> 00:07:40.980
<v Speaker 3>you've just started this so of course you're going to be God awful.</v>

303
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:41.620
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

304
00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.310
<v Speaker 2>That's hard for people to accept though.</v>

305
00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.590
<v Speaker 2>Especially smart people.</v>

306
00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:45.850
<v Speaker 2>Smart people think that.</v>

307
00:07:45.851 --> 00:07:46.211
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

308
00:07:46.211 --> 00:07:46.841
<v Speaker 2>You know what though,</v>

309
00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:47.111
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

310
00:07:47.111 --> 00:07:47.411
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

311
00:07:47.411 --> 00:07:48.244
<v Speaker 2>Stand up.</v>

312
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:49.300
<v Speaker 2>I listened to it.</v>

313
00:07:49.301 --> 00:07:49.511
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

314
00:07:49.511 --> 00:07:52.570
<v Speaker 2>I've have watched it on TV before I think or have an idea how to do it.</v>

315
00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm just gonna bypass all.</v>

316
00:07:54.090 --> 00:07:55.680
<v Speaker 3>Did you think to get that with fucking farming?</v>

317
00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:59.400
<v Speaker 3>You want to tell you how to plan a tomato 10 years and you'll be way better at</v>

318
00:07:59.401 --> 00:07:59.670
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

319
00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:00.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

320
00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:01.170
<v Speaker 2>that's with everything.</v>

321
00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:05.850
<v Speaker 2>But standup is that what people don't understand when they're watching it is</v>

322
00:08:05.851 --> 00:08:06.684
<v Speaker 2>that there's a,</v>

323
00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:08.400
<v Speaker 2>there's a hypnosis going on.</v>

324
00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:12.750
<v Speaker 2>It's not as simple as someone saying something and you're reacting to that.</v>

325
00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:16.110
<v Speaker 2>There is a little ride that a standup takes you on.</v>

326
00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.011
<v Speaker 2>You know when,</v>

327
00:08:17.011 --> 00:08:19.710
<v Speaker 2>when when someone's good and you watch them to this day,</v>

328
00:08:19.711 --> 00:08:21.210
<v Speaker 2>like you get caught up in their,</v>

329
00:08:21.211 --> 00:08:23.040
<v Speaker 2>their groove and you know,</v>

330
00:08:23.041 --> 00:08:23.641
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

331
00:08:23.641 --> 00:08:24.750
<v Speaker 2>you're like tune into them.</v>

332
00:08:24.751 --> 00:08:25.280
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

333
00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:25.690
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

334
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:30.690
<v Speaker 2>there's an exchange going on that it's not as simple as everybody wants to make</v>

335
00:08:31.261 --> 00:08:33.060
<v Speaker 2>it seem like you say something funny.</v>

336
00:08:33.061 --> 00:08:33.781
<v Speaker 2>Ha Ha,</v>

337

<v Speaker 2>this person laughs.</v>

338
00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:35.670
<v Speaker 3>Not that simple.</v>

339
00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:38.490
<v Speaker 3>That's why when you say tosh does something wrong by spending a rape joke,</v>

340
00:08:38.491 --> 00:08:38.671
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

341
00:08:38.671 --> 00:08:39.570
<v Speaker 3>you weren't there.</v>

342
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.950
<v Speaker 3>You don't know about the whole situation.</v>

343
00:08:40.951 --> 00:08:44.670
<v Speaker 3>He set up the last however long he's built his crowd into something.</v>

344
00:08:44.671 --> 00:08:44.941
<v Speaker 3>We're now,</v>

345
00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:45.990
<v Speaker 3>he can do what he wants.</v>

346
00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:46.891
<v Speaker 3>Your God,</v>

347
00:08:46.891 --> 00:08:47.250
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

348
00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:48.510
<v Speaker 3>I remember early on you were like,</v>

349
00:08:48.511 --> 00:08:49.650
<v Speaker 3>I can't open with that.</v>

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:50.090
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

351
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:50.671
<v Speaker 3>I've tried.</v>

352
00:08:50.671 --> 00:08:51.241
<v Speaker 3>It won't work.</v>

353
00:08:51.241 --> 00:08:54.960
<v Speaker 3>You've got to give him like 40 minutes of like calmed down before it can hit him</v>

354
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:55.771
<v Speaker 3>that yeah,</v>

355
00:08:55.771 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 3>like the</v>

356
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:56.341
<v Speaker 1>whole,</v>

357
00:08:56.341 --> 00:08:58.580
<v Speaker 1>that's the whole thing that I was used to do on Noah's Ark.</v>

358
00:08:58.650 --> 00:08:59.420
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

359
00:08:59.420 --> 00:08:59.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

360
00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.530
<v Speaker 1>That all the people who just do would get upset,</v>

361
00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:02.740
<v Speaker 1>which is hilarious.</v>

362
00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:02.970
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

363
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:04.620
<v Speaker 1>You have to get them on your side first.</v>

364
00:09:04.621 --> 00:09:05.460
<v Speaker 1>And if you did it and they'd be like,</v>

365
00:09:05.461 --> 00:09:06.294
<v Speaker 1>it's just not funny.</v>

366
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:06.661
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

367
00:09:06.661 --> 00:09:10.230
<v Speaker 1>it's also then in people didn't know what to expect to come to one of my shows</v>

368
00:09:10.231 --> 00:09:12.240
<v Speaker 1>and they would think there's going to get the guy from fear factor.</v>

369
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:15.840
<v Speaker 1>That's all my fault by holding it up,</v>

370
00:09:15.841 --> 00:09:18.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing shit like fear factor taken,</v>

371
00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.220
<v Speaker 1>taken money for those silly shows.</v>

372
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:22.230
<v Speaker 1>He said bad precedent.</v>

373
00:09:22.231 --> 00:09:22.861
<v Speaker 1>We were like this.</v>

374
00:09:22.861 --> 00:09:23.350
<v Speaker 1>They had a cut.</v>

375
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:24.030
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

376
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:27.350
<v Speaker 1>but fears not a factor for you.</v>

377
00:09:27.351 --> 00:09:28.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>

378
00:09:28.431 --> 00:09:28.850
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't.</v>

379
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:29.940
<v Speaker 1>It's never hard to do.</v>

380
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:30.990
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

381
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:35.990
<v Speaker 1>I would never be a so pompous to pretend that it's actually difficult to do.</v>

382
00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:36.431
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

383
00:09:36.431 --> 00:09:37.860
<v Speaker 1>it's still an amazing job.</v>

384
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.830
<v Speaker 1>Why did you start getting high while you were doing it too?</v>

385
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:41.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

388
00:09:44.370 --> 00:09:45.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

390
00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.620
<v Speaker 1>but I didn't get high at work.</v>

391
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:49.951
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

392
00:09:49.951 --> 00:09:52.200
<v Speaker 1>I know what to get white at and what not to get high at.</v>

393
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:55.650
<v Speaker 1>You went from not smoking at all to smoking at work within a year.</v>

394
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:56.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

402
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:06.983
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>

403

<v Speaker 1>it's just right away.</v>

405
00:10:09.601 --> 00:10:12.570
<v Speaker 1>I recognize that this is like some crazy truth serum.</v>

406
00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:13.683
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's another thing.</v>

409
00:10:14.821 --> 00:10:15.930
<v Speaker 1>It's not as simple as it seems.</v>

410
00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:19.320
<v Speaker 1>You look at marijuana and all those guys were getting high and you just escaping</v>

411
00:10:19.321 --> 00:10:20.154
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

412
00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.860
<v Speaker 1>It's actually doing the exact opposite of escape.</v>

413
00:10:22.861 --> 00:10:24.960
<v Speaker 1>You're seeing reality for what it is.</v>

414
00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:28.680
<v Speaker 1>Diving into it with the lights on as bright as possible.</v>

415
00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:29.250
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

416
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:31.140
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing escape about getting high.</v>

417
00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:32.520
<v Speaker 1>This is what people don't understand.</v>

418
00:10:32.521 --> 00:10:32.721
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

419
00:10:32.721 --> 00:10:33.301
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

420
00:10:33.301 --> 00:10:34.300
<v Speaker 1>that's not what you're looking for.</v>

421
00:10:34.301 --> 00:10:35.430
<v Speaker 1>Especially when you're smoking.</v>

422
00:10:35.431 --> 00:10:37.650
<v Speaker 1>Sativas which another problem,</v>

423
00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:42.120
<v Speaker 1>people don't know that there's two completely different effects at two</v>

424
00:10:42.121 --> 00:10:43.970
<v Speaker 1>completely different types of marijuana.</v>

425
00:10:43.971 --> 00:10:44.280
<v Speaker 1>Half.</v>

426
00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.660
<v Speaker 1>I feel like telling that to people when they say,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you the too,</v>

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:47.041
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

430
00:10:47.041 --> 00:10:47.701
<v Speaker 1>I don't like weed.</v>

431
00:10:47.701 --> 00:10:48.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

432
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:48.990

00:10:50.970 --> 00:10:52.380
<v Speaker 1>you don't really know what you're talking about.</v>

437
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:53.581
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

00:12:20.021 --> 00:12:23.770
<v Speaker 1>let's just pretend like abstinence is the best policy.</v>

494
00:12:24.190 --> 00:12:25.900
<v Speaker 1>We should promote abstinence.</v>

495
00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:26.460
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

496

00:14:33.191 --> 00:14:33.971
<v Speaker 1>going to raise the baby.</v>

584
00:14:33.971 --> 00:14:34.610
<v Speaker 1>It's just like,</v>

585
00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:34.720
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

586
00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:36.430
<v Speaker 1>you don't know anything.</v>

587
00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:39.850
<v Speaker 1>Being a child and having a kid as far as I am fucked up.</v>

588
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:41.050
<v Speaker 1>It's fucked up for everybody.</v>

589
00:14:41.051 --> 00:14:42.250
<v Speaker 1>It's fucked up for the kid too.</v>

590
00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:43.660
<v Speaker 1>It's yes,</v>

591
00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:46.840
<v Speaker 1>but then the question becomes when you're supposed to prevent it after the fact</v>

592
00:14:46.841 --> 00:14:48.820
<v Speaker 1>or before the fact and if after the fact,</v>

593
00:14:48.821 --> 00:14:52.130
<v Speaker 1>is it just you have to just accept it or can you have an abortion?</v>

594
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.260
<v Speaker 1>And of course they're going to have an abortion.</v>

595
00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:54.990
<v Speaker 1>Of course you can.</v>

596
00:14:54.990 --> 00:14:56.120
<v Speaker 1>But the Kim medical age.</v>

597
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.451
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

598
00:14:56.451 --> 00:14:58.220
<v Speaker 1>but to what age?</v>

599
00:14:58.310 --> 00:14:59.810
<v Speaker 1>How old could the fetus be?</v>

600
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:01.003
<v Speaker 1>Nine months.</v>

601
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:03.673
<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

602
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:05.083
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

603
00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:05.780
<v Speaker 1>I Dunno.</v>

604
00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:06.231
<v Speaker 1>What do you think,</v>

605
00:15:06.231 --> 00:15:06.471
<v Speaker 1>Brian?</v>

606
00:15:06.471 --> 00:15:09.920
<v Speaker 1>What I do think though is that it's not as simple as everybody likes to say,</v>

607
00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:10.090
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

608
00:15:10.090 --> 00:15:10.940
<v Speaker 1>it's killing a baby.</v>

609
00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:13.410
<v Speaker 1>We're adults who are making decisions that we don't want to make this light</v>

610
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:14.870
<v Speaker 1>that's deep.</v>

611
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:16.063
<v Speaker 1>That's deep.</v>

612
00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:17.390
<v Speaker 1>It's a heavy decision,</v>

613
00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:19.760
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

614
00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:20.331
<v Speaker 1>It really is.</v>

615
00:15:20.331 --> 00:15:22.040
<v Speaker 1>That's what we've put onto human life for.</v>

616
00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:22.911
<v Speaker 1>Like it comes out,</v>

617
00:15:22.911 --> 00:15:23.490
<v Speaker 1>we're like look,</v>

618
00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:25.430
<v Speaker 1>like when it comes to a certain level,</v>

619
00:15:25.431 --> 00:15:27.200
<v Speaker 1>it's like when it's a bunch of cells,</v>

620
00:15:27.201 --> 00:15:28.550
<v Speaker 1>when it's like 30 cells,</v>

621
00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:29.001
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

622
00:15:29.001 --> 00:15:31.760
<v Speaker 1>then it doesn't seem real then it seems like you'd be able to get rid of it and</v>

623
00:15:31.761 --> 00:15:32.530
<v Speaker 1>not even feel bad.</v>

624
00:15:32.530 --> 00:15:33.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

625
00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.580
<v Speaker 1>But at what point in time,</v>

626
00:15:34.610 --> 00:15:36.440
<v Speaker 1>how easy is it to market it better?</v>

627
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

628
00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:37.513
<v Speaker 1>if it was like</v>

629
00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:43.640
<v Speaker 1>person like Betty White market it for you.</v>

630
00:15:43.641 --> 00:15:46.150
<v Speaker 1>I do like the marketing techniques they have is because of the pro life and</v>

631
00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:46.940
<v Speaker 1>fourth choice.</v>

632
00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:48.260
<v Speaker 1>When you think about just their names,</v>

633
00:15:48.261 --> 00:15:49.250
<v Speaker 1>they're not at odds.</v>

634
00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:52.820
<v Speaker 1>Both pro choices and they're both pro life.</v>

635
00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:53.001
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

636
00:15:53.001 --> 00:15:53.541
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that funny?</v>

637
00:15:53.541 --> 00:15:54.380
<v Speaker 1>Pro Choice.</v>

638
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:57.590
<v Speaker 1>That's a funny way of putting it because otherwise it's pro life or pro death or</v>

639
00:15:57.591 --> 00:15:58.880
<v Speaker 1>pro choice or anti choice.</v>

640
00:15:58.970 --> 00:15:59.271
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

641
00:15:59.271 --> 00:16:01.070
<v Speaker 1>It's pro life or pro choice.</v>

642
00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:01.621
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

643
00:16:01.621 --> 00:16:02.720
<v Speaker 1>those aren't opposites.</v>

644
00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:03.311
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

645
00:16:03.311 --> 00:16:05.240
<v Speaker 1>It's one aspect of the subject.</v>

646
00:16:05.270 --> 00:16:05.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

647
00:16:05.930 --> 00:16:06.630
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

648
00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:08.240
<v Speaker 1>what choice are you making?</v>

649
00:16:08.241 --> 00:16:09.074
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

650
00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.190
<v Speaker 1>Just a kid.</v>

651
00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:14.450
<v Speaker 1>Just call it a choice to kill pro choice.</v>

652
00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:16.250
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's fucking pro choice.</v>

653
00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:18.170
<v Speaker 1>That's just my choice is different than your choice.</v>

654
00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:20.393
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

655
00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:21.733
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

656
00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.300
<v Speaker 1>That is a creepy thing though.</v>

657
00:16:23.301 --> 00:16:25.340
<v Speaker 1>The idea that people would be anti choice.</v>

658
00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:29.090
<v Speaker 1>That's why when someone calls themselves pro choice like sets you up to fail</v>

659
00:16:29.091 --> 00:16:30.050
<v Speaker 1>when you competing against,</v>

660
00:16:30.700 --> 00:16:31.533
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

661
00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:33.500
<v Speaker 1>you know you can't,</v>

662
00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:37.670
<v Speaker 1>they're saying they're pro choice if they just were the pro baby killing party.</v>

663
00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:38.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

664
00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:38.901
<v Speaker 1>Who does that?</v>

665
00:16:38.901 --> 00:16:39.171
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

666
00:16:39.171 --> 00:16:40.190
<v Speaker 1>That's what I'm in favor of.</v>

667
00:16:40.250 --> 00:16:41.480
<v Speaker 1>That's not going to make you money.</v>

668
00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:42.620
<v Speaker 1>I talked to girls before,</v>

669
00:16:42.621 --> 00:16:43.850
<v Speaker 1>I have sex sometimes and I'm like,</v>

670
00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:44.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

671
00:16:44.510 --> 00:16:46.370
<v Speaker 1>what have you had and how do we feel about abortion?</v>

672
00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:47.533
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

673
00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:50.000
<v Speaker 1>it's a heavy conversation right away.</v>

674
00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Ari's mercenary about it.</v>

675
00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:53.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to fucking get that thing.</v>

676
00:16:53.061 --> 00:16:53.481
<v Speaker 1>We just,</v>

677
00:16:53.481 --> 00:16:53.661
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

678
00:16:53.661 --> 00:16:54.411
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that.</v>

679
00:16:54.411 --> 00:16:56.840
<v Speaker 1>She would never have an abortion if anything happened.</v>

680
00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:57.470
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

681
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:58.970
<v Speaker 1>cause I wouldn't bother asking.</v>

682
00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.260
<v Speaker 1>Just saying the words wants.</v>

683
00:17:00.261 --> 00:17:01.041
<v Speaker 1>It's a little uncomfortable.</v>

684
00:17:01.041 --> 00:17:01.821
<v Speaker 1>So I'm going to raise some kid.</v>

685
00:17:01.821 --> 00:17:04.760
<v Speaker 1>I don't want for fucking 10 years or however long you'd have to.</v>

686
00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:07.210
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it crazy?</v>

687
00:17:07.211 --> 00:17:07.701
<v Speaker 1>So you just,</v>

688
00:17:07.701 --> 00:17:08.534
<v Speaker 1>I just ask,</v>

689
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:09.531
<v Speaker 1>isn't it crazy?</v>

690
00:17:09.531 --> 00:17:10.364
<v Speaker 1>That would just,</v>

691
00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:11.600
<v Speaker 1>you play in like,</v>

692
00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:13.490
<v Speaker 1>like when you're,</v>

693
00:17:13.491 --> 00:17:16.140
<v Speaker 1>when you're not trying to have a baby with a check,</v>

694
00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:18.110
<v Speaker 1>it's actually not to,</v>

695
00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.230
<v Speaker 1>you're playing this game of trickery with nature.</v>

696
00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:24.830
<v Speaker 1>Like nature's only reward me with those awesome feelings cause that's how you</v>

697
00:17:24.831 --> 00:17:25.670
<v Speaker 1>make humans,</v>

698
00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:26.241
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

699
00:17:26.241 --> 00:17:27.830
<v Speaker 1>and imagine how much it feels,</v>

700
00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:28.760
<v Speaker 1>how good it feels.</v>

701
00:17:28.761 --> 00:17:30.110
<v Speaker 1>If you're not even masturbating.</v>

702
00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:30.561
<v Speaker 1>I give,</v>

703
00:17:30.561 --> 00:17:34.010
<v Speaker 1>you're not masturbating and you'd just a person and neither one of you ever</v>

704
00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:37.520
<v Speaker 1>masturbate and you get together naked and you wind up fucking like,</v>

705
00:17:37.550 --> 00:17:38.301
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

706
00:17:38.301 --> 00:17:39.470
<v Speaker 1>Of course you're going to come inside her.</v>

707
00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:40.730
<v Speaker 1>Of course she's going to make a person.</v>

708
00:17:40.910 --> 00:17:41.780
<v Speaker 1>That's how they rocked it.</v>

709
00:17:41.790 --> 00:17:46.770
<v Speaker 1>Caveman just keeps feeling good and they stopped.</v>

710
00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:47.613
<v Speaker 1>It would never stop.</v>

711
00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:48.950
<v Speaker 1>It was two people went,</v>

712
00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:49.621
<v Speaker 1>oh wait a minute.</v>

713
00:17:49.621 --> 00:17:50.090
<v Speaker 1>Babies come</v>

714
00:17:50.090 --> 00:17:50.810
<v Speaker 3>a little pull out.</v>

715
00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:50.920
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

716
00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:51.660
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

717
00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:54.950
<v Speaker 3>We had to figure out what makes the baby part Louie bit about it.</v>

718
00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:55.350
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

719
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:56.910
<v Speaker 3>but if animals had to watch humans,</v>

720
00:17:56.911 --> 00:17:58.440
<v Speaker 3>like animal planet version of humans,</v>

721
00:17:58.860 --> 00:17:59.221
<v Speaker 3>they'd be like,</v>

722
00:17:59.221 --> 00:18:02.070
<v Speaker 3>see this meeting and then we pull out and shit on the floor or something like,</v>

723
00:18:02.071 --> 00:18:03.720
<v Speaker 3>but you were so close.</v>

724
00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:05.040
<v Speaker 3>What are you doing?</v>

725
00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.153
<v Speaker 3>That's funny.</v>

726
00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:11.820
<v Speaker 3>I thought I said tell my friends in college when I was still a virgin that</v>

727
00:18:11.821 --> 00:18:15.060
<v Speaker 3>masturbation was the same as sex and they were like,</v>

728
00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:15.740
<v Speaker 3>Ari,</v>

729
00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:16.201
<v Speaker 3>you're wrong.</v>

730
00:18:16.201 --> 00:18:16.381
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

731
00:18:16.381 --> 00:18:16.591
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

732
00:18:16.591 --> 00:18:17.580
<v Speaker 3>you guys are idiots.</v>

733
00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:21.210
<v Speaker 3>It's the same thing that's happening physically to your genitalia.</v>

734
00:18:21.330 --> 00:18:22.320
<v Speaker 3>How could it feel better?</v>

735
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:24.810
<v Speaker 3>It's the same act and they were like,</v>

736
00:18:24.811 --> 00:18:25.800
<v Speaker 3>you just don't get it.</v>

737
00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:29.730
<v Speaker 3>How could you think that your hand could be as good as a pussy because you</v>

738
00:18:29.731 --> 00:18:31.140
<v Speaker 3>coming would be the same.</v>

739
00:18:31.141 --> 00:18:32.430
<v Speaker 3>That's you coming as you coming.</v>

740
00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.330
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

741
00:18:33.330 --> 00:18:34.050
<v Speaker 3>that's interesting.</v>

742
00:18:34.050 --> 00:18:35.400
<v Speaker 3>Isn't it funny that that's not the case?</v>

743
00:18:35.401 --> 00:18:36.570
<v Speaker 3>That's not at all the case.</v>

744
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.210
<v Speaker 3>Like when you're really into a chick and she's really sexy,</v>

745
00:18:39.211 --> 00:18:43.220
<v Speaker 3>you rang especially a little drunk and you love each other and you come like,</v>

746
00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:44.640
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>

747
00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:46.090
<v Speaker 3>Oh God,</v>

748
00:18:48.830 --> 00:18:50.340
<v Speaker 3>I feel so good.</v>

749
00:18:50.770 --> 00:18:51.361
<v Speaker 3>It's amazing.</v>

750
00:18:51.361 --> 00:18:52.500
<v Speaker 3>Sweet corn in the morning.</v>

751
00:18:53.790 --> 00:18:55.650
<v Speaker 3>It's supposed to be to make you make people.</v>

752
00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:56.821
<v Speaker 3>That's really what,</v>

753
00:18:56.821 --> 00:18:58.050
<v Speaker 3>that's why it feels so good.</v>

754
00:18:58.051 --> 00:18:58.990
<v Speaker 3>You can't even think straight on.</v>

755
00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:00.150
<v Speaker 3>It's a biological trick.</v>

756
00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:01.110
<v Speaker 3>It's a wonderful one.</v>

757
00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.810
<v Speaker 3>Wipe off the tip and put it back in.</v>

758
00:19:02.820 --> 00:19:03.653
<v Speaker 3>It's me.</v>

759
00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:07.920
<v Speaker 3>If you had to think about that with a straight mind wiping off the tip and</v>

760
00:19:07.921 --> 00:19:10.200
<v Speaker 3>putting it back in but not be a viable option.</v>

761
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:11.071
<v Speaker 3>How about this one?</v>

762
00:19:11.071 --> 00:19:12.150
<v Speaker 3>Just let me rub it on the outside.</v>

763
00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.150
<v Speaker 3>She had ever taken place ever in the history of the human race.</v>

764
00:19:21.350 --> 00:19:22.590
<v Speaker 3>It was on one of my cds.</v>

765
00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.620
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

766
00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:32.940
<v Speaker 3>That's your best match I've ever done right there.</v>

767
00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:37.951
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

768
00:19:37.951 --> 00:19:38.820
<v Speaker 3>I forgot about that.</v>

769
00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:39.271
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

770
00:19:39.271 --> 00:19:40.104
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>

771
00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:40.711
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>

772
00:19:40.711 --> 00:19:41.700
<v Speaker 3>Working at this store,</v>

773
00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:42.480
<v Speaker 3>like as an employee,</v>

774
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.750
<v Speaker 3>as a fucking door man and cover booth guy just helps you so much.</v>

775
00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:50.840
<v Speaker 3>Watch all these fucking great comics and you just watch them and learn technique</v>

776
00:19:51.181 --> 00:19:51.660
<v Speaker 3>and shit.</v>

777
00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.580
<v Speaker 3>You get to see them do the same jokes a lot too.</v>

778
00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:57.030
<v Speaker 3>It was interesting as a guy learning how to do it because everybody wants to</v>

779
00:19:57.031 --> 00:19:59.610
<v Speaker 3>think as an audience member that that a person on stage saying something.</v>

780
00:19:59.760 --> 00:20:01.180
<v Speaker 3>That's the first time I've ever said it.</v>

781
00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:03.150
<v Speaker 3>You really can't do that every time.</v>

782
00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:04.920
<v Speaker 3>I mean we kind of can,</v>

783
00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:06.000
<v Speaker 3>but it won't be as good.</v>

784
00:20:06.001 --> 00:20:06.834
<v Speaker 3>Trust me,</v>

785
00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.400
<v Speaker 3>it's better if we write stuff out.</v>

786
00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:10.800
<v Speaker 3>It's better if we practice things a few times.</v>

787
00:20:10.801 --> 00:20:11.760
<v Speaker 3>It's better if you get it on.</v>

788
00:20:11.950 --> 00:20:13.080
<v Speaker 3>Then there's this certain bits.</v>

789
00:20:13.081 --> 00:20:13.381
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

790
00:20:13.381 --> 00:20:15.030
<v Speaker 3>there's certain bits where it right out of the gate.</v>

791
00:20:15.031 --> 00:20:15.690
<v Speaker 3>They're awesome.</v>

792
00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:16.230
<v Speaker 3>It's cool.</v>

793
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:18.120
<v Speaker 3>But it happens.</v>

794
00:20:18.150 --> 00:20:20.340
<v Speaker 3>You can't guarantee when those are coming in when they're not.</v>

795
00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:21.473
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

796
00:20:21.690 --> 00:20:22.620
<v Speaker 3>there's something in Indianapolis.</v>

797
00:20:22.621 --> 00:20:25.050
<v Speaker 3>I came back to my show second time cause he came one night,</v>

798
00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:26.010
<v Speaker 3>then he got my album,</v>

799
00:20:26.011 --> 00:20:27.630
<v Speaker 3>which was different of the call up,</v>

800
00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:32.070
<v Speaker 3>holocaust available revenge for the Holocaust Ladies Gentlemen available on</v>

801
00:20:32.071 --> 00:20:32.821
<v Speaker 3>Itunes,</v>

802
00:20:32.821 --> 00:20:33.654
<v Speaker 3>Amazon.</v>

803
00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:35.700
<v Speaker 3>But he was like,</v>

804
00:20:35.701 --> 00:20:35.791
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

805
00:20:35.791 --> 00:20:36.301
<v Speaker 3>it's different.</v>

806
00:20:36.301 --> 00:20:37.400
<v Speaker 3>So I figured I'd come back again,</v>

807
00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:40.560
<v Speaker 3>see another show and he just sat up front and I couldn't even look.</v>

808
00:20:40.561 --> 00:20:41.340
<v Speaker 3>He was on my right.</v>

809
00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.470
<v Speaker 3>I did my whole act from straight to left.</v>

810
00:20:43.471 --> 00:20:44.580
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't even look over there.</v>

811
00:20:45.420 --> 00:20:45.721
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

812
00:20:45.721 --> 00:20:46.380
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

813
00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:47.560
<v Speaker 3>you shouldn't come back.</v>

814
00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.540
<v Speaker 3>And he was like the same jokes.</v>

815
00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:50.374
<v Speaker 3>That's so creepy.</v>

816
00:20:50.650 --> 00:20:51.051
<v Speaker 3>It's a mind.</v>

817
00:20:51.051 --> 00:20:51.390
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

818
00:20:51.390 --> 00:20:52.510
<v Speaker 3>I feel so fake.</v>

819
00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:53.111
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You are fake fat faker.</v>

823
00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.580
<v Speaker 3>You didn't just think of something when you're up there.</v>

824
00:20:57.581 --> 00:20:58.414
<v Speaker 3>God dammit.</v>

825
00:20:58.950 --> 00:21:00.760
<v Speaker 3>You worked on it every night for six months.</v>

826
00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:02.470
<v Speaker 3>I just realized,</v>

827
00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:03.100
<v Speaker 3>no you didn't.</v>

828
00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:03.940
<v Speaker 3>You're fucking line</v>

829
00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:05.001
<v Speaker 4>the death squad,</v>

830
00:21:05.001 --> 00:21:05.601
<v Speaker 4>Ohio guys.</v>

831
00:21:05.601 --> 00:21:06.890
<v Speaker 4>They go the boat shows,</v>

832
00:21:06.891 --> 00:21:10.040
<v Speaker 4>they'll go to like these seven o'clock show and the nine o'clock show.</v>

833
00:21:10.041 --> 00:21:11.690
<v Speaker 4>So it's just like you guys,</v>

834
00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:14.870
<v Speaker 3>it becomes a bit of a gay circle joke.</v>

835
00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:15.713
<v Speaker 3>At a certain point.</v>

836
00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:19.130
<v Speaker 3>I sort of get it where it's like you can see like modest mouse.</v>

837
00:21:19.131 --> 00:21:20.960
<v Speaker 3>There's some band like two times in a row.</v>

838
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

839

840
00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:24.330
<v Speaker 4>more than once in a row.</v>

841
00:21:24.331 --> 00:21:25.740
<v Speaker 4>I went to see bill Hicks twice in a row.</v>

842
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:30.270
<v Speaker 4>I saw a bunch of guys back in the day where I saw the same act more than once.</v>

843
00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:31.790
<v Speaker 3>Joe Loads aren't used to come to,</v>

844
00:21:31.791 --> 00:21:32.080
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

845
00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:34.130
<v Speaker 3>to our shows when we did none of the way and shows.</v>

846
00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:34.730
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

847
00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:35.340
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

848
00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:36.030
<v Speaker 3>and there was this joke,</v>

849
00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:37.170
<v Speaker 3>have you just make a bunch of Jitsu?</v>

850
00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:38.593
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

851
00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:39.441
<v Speaker 3>I guess I can do it now.</v>

852
00:21:39.441 --> 00:21:40.220
<v Speaker 3>I never do it anymore,</v>

853
00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:40.611
<v Speaker 3>but like,</v>

854
00:21:40.611 --> 00:21:41.000
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

855
00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:41.811
<v Speaker 3>I've got the way that you just,</v>

856
00:21:41.811 --> 00:21:43.760
<v Speaker 3>it was invented was some Brazilian guy,</v>

857
00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:44.810
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

858
00:21:44.810 --> 00:21:46.300
<v Speaker 3>came on work from early one day,</v>

859
00:21:46.330 --> 00:21:51.050
<v Speaker 3>came home early from work one day and found his wife did not have dinner ready</v>

860
00:21:51.051 --> 00:21:51.884
<v Speaker 3>for him.</v>

861
00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:56.450
<v Speaker 3>So he's choking her because of that fucking choking the life out of her and the</v>

862
00:21:56.451 --> 00:21:59.360
<v Speaker 3>girl's father comes in cause I live in the same fucking hut in Brazil.</v>

863
00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:00.553
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

864
00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:00.891
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

865
00:22:00.891 --> 00:22:01.724
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>

866
00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:02.950
<v Speaker 3>You're doing it wrong.</v>

867
00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:05.540
<v Speaker 3>You got to fucking put hooks in and then come from behind.</v>

868
00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:07.970
<v Speaker 3>And that's how Jujitsu was invented.</v>

869
00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:09.021
<v Speaker 3>That's my theory.</v>

870
00:22:09.021 --> 00:22:09.690

<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

944
00:23:46.270 --> 00:23:47.960
<v Speaker 1>it's big as a Phoenix,</v>

945
00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:49.310
<v Speaker 1>the standup life in Phoenix,</v>

946
00:23:49.340 --> 00:23:50.270
<v Speaker 1>it's bigger than that.</v>

947
00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:51.193
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

948
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.010
<v Speaker 1>The,</v>

949
00:23:52.010 --> 00:23:56.030
<v Speaker 1>just because it's more stage room and standard blind and Phoenix is 600 seats,</v>

950
00:23:56.031 --> 00:23:56.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

951
00:23:56.570 --> 00:23:58.970
<v Speaker 1>It's 50 it's bigger than six 50.</v>

952
00:23:59.000 --> 00:23:59.790
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

953
00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:02.150
<v Speaker 1>Well the scope of it is bigger anyway.</v>

954
00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:02.831
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

955
00:24:02.831 --> 00:24:03.540
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>

956
00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:04.680
<v Speaker 1>To the wall and stuff.</v>

957
00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:05.001
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

958
00:24:05.001 --> 00:24:08.660
<v Speaker 1>It's right next to so many to stores and restaurants that stand up live is the</v>

959
00:24:08.661 --> 00:24:13.580
<v Speaker 1>most intimate 600 you could get because even though it was 600 seats,</v>

960
00:24:13.581 --> 00:24:15.050
<v Speaker 1>it felt like it's like a club,</v>

961
00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:15.800
<v Speaker 1>but just keeps going.</v>

962
00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:16.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

963
00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:17.990
<v Speaker 1>It felt like once we worked out,</v>

964
00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:20.510
<v Speaker 1>if you would please Jen on the first show,</v>

965
00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:22.790
<v Speaker 1>there was a problem with the microphone.</v>

966
00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:23.751
<v Speaker 1>We'll monitor.</v>

967
00:24:23.751 --> 00:24:24.411
<v Speaker 1>It was no minor,</v>

968
00:24:24.411 --> 00:24:25.490
<v Speaker 1>so you can hear yourself.</v>

969
00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:29.090
<v Speaker 1>There's a rider somehow I have a rider that I didn't know it was that weird</v>

970
00:24:29.091 --> 00:24:29.330
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

971
00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

972
00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:32.780
<v Speaker 1>and one of the things on is that I have to have a wireless mic.</v>

973
00:24:32.781 --> 00:24:35.270
<v Speaker 1>I don't need a fucking wireless Mike Wireless Mikes.</v>

974
00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:36.313
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

975
00:24:37.150 --> 00:24:38.720
<v Speaker 1>I know for when you do like theaters,</v>

976
00:24:38.721 --> 00:24:40.310
<v Speaker 1>like the more theater in Seattle or whatever.</v>

977
00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:41.180
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

978
00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:42.710
<v Speaker 1>just make sure you have everything right.</v>

979
00:24:42.740 --> 00:24:44.600
<v Speaker 1>We need them because they don't know sometimes the stand up,</v>

980
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:45.141
<v Speaker 1>but even then,</v>

981
00:24:45.141 --> 00:24:46.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't need a wireless one.</v>

982
00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:50.860
<v Speaker 1>Having James Mooney and it's Kevin.</v>

983
00:24:50.861 --> 00:24:51.531
<v Speaker 1>I met Kevin.</v>

984
00:24:51.531 --> 00:24:52.510
<v Speaker 1>James is rider.</v>

985
00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:54.560
<v Speaker 1>He gets red wine and right where I,</v>

986
00:24:54.561 --> 00:24:54.741

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:46.530
<v Speaker 2>incidents between the Indians and the white men,</v>

1098
00:27:46.531 --> 00:27:49.350
<v Speaker 2>the white men breaking the treaties and the wars that took place.</v>

1099
00:27:49.351 --> 00:27:54.351
<v Speaker 2>And we were camping on the Missouri River where Lewis and Clark camped.</v>

1100
00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:55.921
<v Speaker 2>That's where we camped.</v>

1101
00:27:55.921 --> 00:28:00.180
<v Speaker 2>And we did all our travel by canoe or by hiking.</v>

1102
00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:00.660
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1103
00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:01.111
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1104
00:28:01.111 --> 00:28:02.880
<v Speaker 2>it was fucking intense.</v>

1105
00:28:02.881 --> 00:28:04.050
<v Speaker 2>So when you hiked by the Missouri River,</v>

1106
00:28:04.051 --> 00:28:05.070
<v Speaker 2>was anyone else around?</v>

1107
00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:08.580
<v Speaker 2>We saw in the five days we were there,</v>

1108
00:28:08.581 --> 00:28:12.360
<v Speaker 2>we traveled 40 plus miles down the Missouri River.</v>

1109
00:28:12.930 --> 00:28:17.930
<v Speaker 2>And in all that time we saw three other boats.</v>

1110
00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:18.660
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

1111
00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:21.180
<v Speaker 2>And then when you got off and was like walking around and stuff?</v>

1112
00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:21.331
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1113
00:28:21.331 --> 00:28:23.070
<v Speaker 2>once we got out at the very end,</v>

1114
00:28:23.071 --> 00:28:26.760
<v Speaker 2>we were in a place where there was a bridge and it was cars and traffic and</v>

1115
00:28:26.761 --> 00:28:27.594
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

1116
00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:28.723
<v Speaker 2>It's down.</v>

1117
00:28:28.980 --> 00:28:29.191
<v Speaker 2>Ah,</v>

1118
00:28:29.191 --> 00:28:31.830
<v Speaker 2>over those five days we saw nothing but canoes.</v>

1119
00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:33.390
<v Speaker 2>We saw it three or four canoes.</v>

1120
00:28:33.391 --> 00:28:34.710
<v Speaker 2>It was mostly just us.</v>

1121
00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:38.430
<v Speaker 2>And we had a satellite phone in case we had like an emergency.</v>

1122
00:28:38.910 --> 00:28:39.360
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1123
00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.880
<v Speaker 2>and what we did was we pulled in,</v>

1124
00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:42.990
<v Speaker 2>we got there,</v>

1125
00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:43.570
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1126

1128
00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:51.230

1133
00:28:57.900 --> 00:28:59.310
<v Speaker 2>the Missouri River billings.</v>

1134

1137
00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:11.400
<v Speaker 2>to the river.</v>

1138

00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:46.443
<v Speaker 2>so we're on this,</v>

1160
00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:47.380
<v Speaker 2>we're on this river.</v>

1161
00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:47.540
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1162
00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:48.400
<v Speaker 2>the first night we get there,</v>

1163
00:29:48.401 --> 00:29:49.270
<v Speaker 2>it's pouring rain.</v>

1164
00:29:49.271 --> 00:29:50.260
<v Speaker 2>We sleep in tents.</v>

1165
00:29:50.261 --> 00:29:52.240
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking freezing outside.</v>

1166
00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:54.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's really cold like 33 34 degrees.</v>

1167
00:29:54.881 --> 00:29:59.500
<v Speaker 2>Just w just cold enough so it doesn't snow but the rain comes down.</v>

1168
00:29:59.501 --> 00:30:01.480
<v Speaker 2>It's just ridiculously miserable.</v>

1169
00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:02.710
<v Speaker 2>Then we get up in the morning.</v>

1170
00:30:02.711 --> 00:30:03.544
<v Speaker 2>Have warmers or anything?</v>

1171
00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:04.050
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

1172
00:30:04.050 --> 00:30:06.740
<v Speaker 2>You just sleeping bags at that night like I,</v>

1173
00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:07.780
<v Speaker 2>this was a bad idea.</v>

1174
00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:09.641
<v Speaker 2>No Man,</v>

1175
00:30:09.641 --> 00:30:10.300
<v Speaker 2>I was committed.</v>

1176
00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.470
<v Speaker 2>I was 100% committed.</v>

1177
00:30:11.471 --> 00:30:11.891
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1178
00:30:11.891 --> 00:30:12.340
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1179
00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:13.390
<v Speaker 2>if I'm going to do this,</v>

1180
00:30:13.391 --> 00:30:16.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do this the right way with this Guy Rinella believes in is what's</v>

1181
00:30:16.511 --> 00:30:18.130
<v Speaker 2>called a fair chase hunt.</v>

1182
00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:21.760
<v Speaker 2>And what that means is like there's certain people that have like a,</v>

1183
00:30:21.790 --> 00:30:25.120
<v Speaker 2>they have property like a giant ranch and it's like a high fence.</v>

1184
00:30:25.390 --> 00:30:27.130
<v Speaker 2>And so there's all these deer inside this,</v>

1185
00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:31.550
<v Speaker 2>this ranch and he like set up a stand and then there'll be like a little feeder</v>

1186
00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:34.060
<v Speaker 2>that goes off and it goes off at the same time every morning.</v>

1187
00:30:34.061 --> 00:30:37.270
<v Speaker 2>And it drops food and the animals come in and get the food and you blast him.</v>

1188
00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:37.451
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1189
00:30:37.451 --> 00:30:39.610
<v Speaker 2>that's exactly what though.</v>

1190
00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean not just trick them.</v>

1191
00:30:42.011 --> 00:30:43.930
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like the ultimate setup as well.</v>

1192
00:30:43.931 --> 00:30:45.310
<v Speaker 2>Just get your foot in the supermarket.</v>

1193
00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:46.303
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1194
00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:47.110
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1195
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:49.120
<v Speaker 2>And if that's how you were approaching it,</v>

1196
00:30:49.150 --> 00:30:50.140
<v Speaker 2>I can understand that.</v>

1197
00:30:50.141 --> 00:30:53.290
<v Speaker 2>Like say if you lived on that farm and that's how you look,</v>

1198
00:30:53.291 --> 00:30:55.000
<v Speaker 2>if that's actually smart,</v>

1199
00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:59.170
<v Speaker 2>because it's a lot smarter than you know,</v>

1200
00:30:59.171 --> 00:30:59.950
<v Speaker 2>at going hunting,</v>

1201
00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:00.870
<v Speaker 2>going and hunting for it.</v>

1202
00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:01.241
<v Speaker 2>You should,</v>

1203
00:31:01.241 --> 00:31:01.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1204
00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:03.100
<v Speaker 2>control your environment better.</v>

1205
00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:04.090
<v Speaker 2>You need that food.</v>

1206
00:31:04.091 --> 00:31:06.070
<v Speaker 2>It's not like you can do it like as a sport.</v>

1207
00:31:06.490 --> 00:31:08.080
<v Speaker 2>But we,</v>

1208
00:31:08.081 --> 00:31:08.291
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1209
00:31:08.291 --> 00:31:08.830
<v Speaker 2>we went,</v>

1210
00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:10.600
<v Speaker 2>we went and did everything the hard way.</v>

1211
00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:14.170
<v Speaker 2>We hiked every morning for about three miles,</v>

1212
00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:14.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1213
00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.390
<v Speaker 2>over this mountain.</v>

1214
00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:19.750
<v Speaker 2>These like these hills that were made out of,</v>

1215
00:31:19.930 --> 00:31:24.640
<v Speaker 2>they're made out of like a clay that used to be the great inland Western,</v>

1216
00:31:24.641 --> 00:31:26.890
<v Speaker 2>see great western inland sea,</v>

1217
00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:28.210
<v Speaker 2>Great Western inland sea.</v>

1218
00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:29.020
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1219
00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:30.460
<v Speaker 2>during the Jurassic period,</v>

1220
00:31:30.670 --> 00:31:33.720
<v Speaker 2>there was fucking dinosaurs there and there's fossilize.</v>

1221
00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.230
<v Speaker 2>It was a shallow,</v>

1222
00:31:35.231 --> 00:31:37.780
<v Speaker 2>warm water ocean where Montana is.</v>

1223
00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:42.930
<v Speaker 2>So when you are a walking around there you find like fossilized shells like in</v>

1224
00:31:43.001 --> 00:31:43.870
<v Speaker 2>the strata,</v>

1225
00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:48.070
<v Speaker 2>you know like when things break off they also find buffalo skulls all the time.</v>

1226
00:31:48.071 --> 00:31:49.580
<v Speaker 2>Like in the strata because,</v>

1227
00:31:49.581 --> 00:31:50.440
<v Speaker 2>well what a strata.</v>

1228
00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:51.020
<v Speaker 2>Me the,</v>

1229
00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:53.890
<v Speaker 2>you know how the earth has like layers to it though?</v>

1230
00:31:53.910 --> 00:31:54.790
<v Speaker 2>Well those layers,</v>

1231
00:31:54.791 --> 00:31:56.440
<v Speaker 2>if you cut a slice through the earth,</v>

1232
00:31:56.441 --> 00:32:01.150
<v Speaker 2>those layers represent errors and you can tell by how far it goes down by</v>

1233
00:32:01.151 --> 00:32:01.984
<v Speaker 2>whatever measurement,</v>

1234
00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:03.161
<v Speaker 2>how many thousands,</v>

1235
00:32:03.161 --> 00:32:04.570
<v Speaker 2>millions of years it was.</v>

1236
00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.580
<v Speaker 2>And you saw like a place that cut out and stuff?</v>

1237
00:32:06.581 --> 00:32:06.761
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1238
00:32:06.761 --> 00:32:10.570
<v Speaker 2>You see like fossilize shells like on the ground,</v>

1239
00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:11.521
<v Speaker 2>I mean it the,</v>

1240
00:32:11.521 --> 00:32:13.510
<v Speaker 2>the place it's called the bad lands.</v>

1241
00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:13.841
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1242
00:32:13.841 --> 00:32:14.674
<v Speaker 2>And it is,</v>

1243
00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:15.820
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1244
00:32:15.820 --> 00:32:17.420
<v Speaker 2>it's really cool,</v>

1245
00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:18.190
<v Speaker 2>timid dating.</v>

1246
00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:18.821
<v Speaker 2>It's a very,</v>

1247
00:32:18.821 --> 00:32:23.140
<v Speaker 2>very intimidating place because there's this river and then there's she's</v>

1248
00:32:23.141 --> 00:32:27.520
<v Speaker 2>fucking mountains that are covered with this clay shit and you're trying to walk</v>

1249
00:32:27.521 --> 00:32:27.711
<v Speaker 2>in it,</v>

1250
00:32:27.711 --> 00:32:29.260
<v Speaker 2>you're sliding all over the place.</v>

1251
00:32:29.261 --> 00:32:33.010
<v Speaker 2>It's really difficult to get a footing because it's essentially silt,</v>

1252
00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:34.990
<v Speaker 2>silt from the bottom of the ocean.</v>

1253
00:32:34.991 --> 00:32:38.860
<v Speaker 2>It's covered this whole thing and it freezes up and then it gets wet and it gets</v>

1254
00:32:38.861 --> 00:32:39.170
<v Speaker 2>wet,</v>

1255
00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:40.980
<v Speaker 2>becomes muck and it freezes up again.</v>

1256
00:32:40.981 --> 00:32:41.811
<v Speaker 2>So when it's hard,</v>

1257
00:32:41.811 --> 00:32:42.501
<v Speaker 2>you can walk on it,</v>

1258
00:32:42.501 --> 00:32:43.250
<v Speaker 2>no problem.</v>

1259
00:32:43.250 --> 00:32:44.330
<v Speaker 2>But when it becomes wet,</v>

1260
00:32:44.331 --> 00:32:46.010
<v Speaker 2>it's just a fucking crazy nightmare.</v>

1261
00:32:46.011 --> 00:32:50.150
<v Speaker 2>So we were climbing these wet hills of this shit and it's exhausting.</v>

1262
00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:51.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean really exhausting.</v>

1263
00:32:51.561 --> 00:32:52.520
<v Speaker 2>And you're doing it for,</v>

1264
00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:54.200
<v Speaker 2>you do that for several hours in the morning.</v>

1265
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:58.700
<v Speaker 2>And then we would go in a row row the canoes down river for several miles.</v>

1266
00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:00.050
<v Speaker 2>And then once we would get out,</v>

1267
00:33:00.051 --> 00:33:04.090
<v Speaker 2>then we would go and hike for several more miles to get back and there a deer.</v>

1268
00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:05.920
<v Speaker 2>You pull up your,</v>

1269
00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:06.763
<v Speaker 2>your canoe,</v>

1270
00:33:06.850 --> 00:33:07.760
<v Speaker 2>he said camp.</v>

1271
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.110
<v Speaker 2>And then you go and look for deer.</v>

1272
00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:10.850
<v Speaker 2>Bears are predators.</v>

1273
00:33:10.851 --> 00:33:13.490
<v Speaker 2>They're predators or Wa we saw a mountain lion shit.</v>

1274
00:33:13.710 --> 00:33:15.110
<v Speaker 2>And they attack humans a lot.</v>

1275
00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:16.101
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1276
00:33:16.101 --> 00:33:17.090
<v Speaker 2>there's too many of us.</v>

1277
00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:18.290
<v Speaker 2>And we have rifles.</v>

1278
00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.510
<v Speaker 2>We probably be would be safe.</v>

1279
00:33:20.511 --> 00:33:23.660
<v Speaker 2>But you never can tell if you're in the wrong situation at the wrong time.</v>

1280
00:33:23.661 --> 00:33:24.390
<v Speaker 2>Hunger and amount.</v>

1281
00:33:24.390 --> 00:33:24.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1282
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:25.970
<v Speaker 2>For Mountain Lions old,</v>

1283
00:33:25.971 --> 00:33:27.560
<v Speaker 2>if it can't catch a deer anymore,</v>

1284
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.921
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1285
00:33:27.921 --> 00:33:28.880
<v Speaker 2>if it's starving,</v>

1286
00:33:28.881 --> 00:33:29.480
<v Speaker 2>if you catch them,</v>

1287
00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:30.380
<v Speaker 2>you can just catch them.</v>

1288
00:33:30.650 --> 00:33:32.510
<v Speaker 2>But where you were camping at night like by the river,</v>

1289
00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:33.373
<v Speaker 2>that was okay.</v>

1290
00:33:33.530 --> 00:33:33.891
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1291
00:33:33.891 --> 00:33:36.410
<v Speaker 2>While we were camping at sites where you're allowed camp,</v>

1292
00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:37.760
<v Speaker 2>you know you're allowed to set up and we,</v>

1293
00:33:37.761 --> 00:33:38.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1294
00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:40.170
<v Speaker 2>after the first night it stopped raining so we,</v>

1295
00:33:40.171 --> 00:33:41.300
<v Speaker 2>we made fires.</v>

1296
00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:42.431
<v Speaker 2>But the,</v>

1297
00:33:42.431 --> 00:33:43.580
<v Speaker 2>the nighttime man,</v>

1298
00:33:43.581 --> 00:33:44.390
<v Speaker 2>when you,</v>

1299
00:33:44.390 --> 00:33:46.370
<v Speaker 2>first of all it's fucking freezing.</v>

1300
00:33:46.371 --> 00:33:49.340
<v Speaker 2>Like we've got down to as cold as 12 degrees spin.</v>

1301
00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:49.791
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1302
00:33:49.791 --> 00:33:50.240
<v Speaker 2>it didn't spill.</v>

1303
00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:52.550
<v Speaker 2>We slept in separate tents were all sleeping outside.</v>

1304
00:33:52.551 --> 00:33:54.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean we're outside in the fucking,</v>

1305
00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:54.931
<v Speaker 2>I mean you,</v>

1306
00:33:54.931 --> 00:33:56.540
<v Speaker 2>you have to zip yourself up in these,</v>

1307
00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:57.860
<v Speaker 2>you wear a wool underwear,</v>

1308
00:33:57.861 --> 00:33:59.030
<v Speaker 2>you wear like thermal,</v>

1309
00:33:59.031 --> 00:33:59.330
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1310
00:33:59.330 --> 00:34:01.550
<v Speaker 2>like long John Tyler wool underwear.</v>

1311
00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:03.110
<v Speaker 2>And then you were on top of that,</v>

1312
00:34:03.111 --> 00:34:05.900
<v Speaker 2>like a thick pair of these wool pants.</v>

1313
00:34:06.170 --> 00:34:08.120
<v Speaker 2>And then on top of that I've got,</v>

1314
00:34:08.121 --> 00:34:08.511
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1315
00:34:08.511 --> 00:34:11.090
<v Speaker 2>a above me of God will long,</v>

1316
00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:15.320
<v Speaker 2>long underwear top and then two layers and then a jacket and then a down coat</v>

1317
00:34:15.321 --> 00:34:16.160
<v Speaker 2>over the jacket.</v>

1318
00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:19.640
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm inside the sleeping bag in the down coat with a hood up and the</v>

1319
00:34:19.641 --> 00:34:21.920
<v Speaker 2>hood on the sleeping bag and you're barely able to do it.</v>

1320
00:34:22.490 --> 00:34:23.360
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking cold.</v>

1321
00:34:23.390 --> 00:34:25.010
<v Speaker 2>But once you get in there for awhile,</v>

1322
00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.830
<v Speaker 2>especially once I've realized to sleep with the jacket on,</v>

1323
00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:30.380
<v Speaker 2>like I thought I should probably take my layers off,</v>

1324
00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:31.430
<v Speaker 2>but it was too cold.</v>

1325
00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:33.010
<v Speaker 2>It's you to rule part.</v>

1326
00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:33.821
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1327
00:34:33.821 --> 00:34:34.341
<v Speaker 2>It sucks.</v>

1328
00:34:34.341 --> 00:34:35.780
<v Speaker 2>It sucks a masturbating,</v>

1329
00:34:35.781 --> 00:34:36.370
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1330
00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:36.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1331
00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:37.520
<v Speaker 2>I held my loads,</v>

1332
00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:39.730
<v Speaker 2>I held my loads for strength and it,</v>

1333
00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:42.560
<v Speaker 2>it benefited me in for my endurance.</v>

1334
00:34:42.561 --> 00:34:43.071
<v Speaker 2>Cause it was a,</v>

1335
00:34:43.071 --> 00:34:44.480
<v Speaker 2>it was a difficult thing to do.</v>

1336
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:44.870
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1337
00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:45.291
<v Speaker 2>it seems,</v>

1338
00:34:45.291 --> 00:34:45.861
<v Speaker 2>it seems like,</v>

1339
00:34:45.861 --> 00:34:46.011
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1340
00:34:46.011 --> 00:34:47.090
<v Speaker 2>you're whining about like,</v>

1341
00:34:47.091 --> 00:34:47.661
<v Speaker 2>I work out.</v>

1342
00:34:47.661 --> 00:34:47.961
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>

1343
00:34:47.961 --> 00:34:48.771
<v Speaker 2>I do tough stuff.</v>

1344
00:34:48.771 --> 00:34:49.161
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>

1345
00:34:49.161 --> 00:34:49.651
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1346
00:34:49.651 --> 00:34:49.850
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1347
00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:51.620
<v Speaker 2>like hard kettlebell workouts.</v>

1348
00:34:51.621 --> 00:34:52.580
<v Speaker 2>I do Jujitsu,</v>

1349
00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:53.690
<v Speaker 2>very difficult things.</v>

1350
00:34:53.691 --> 00:34:55.280
<v Speaker 2>But this hiking shit,</v>

1351
00:34:55.310 --> 00:34:55.631
<v Speaker 2>when you're,</v>

1352
00:34:55.631 --> 00:34:57.680
<v Speaker 2>you're hiking around in mud all day,</v>

1353
00:34:57.710 --> 00:34:57.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1354
00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:58.753
<v Speaker 2>uphill.</v>

1355
00:34:58.820 --> 00:34:59.780
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking hard,</v>

1356
00:34:59.781 --> 00:35:00.051
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1357
00:35:00.051 --> 00:35:00.231
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

1358
00:35:00.231 --> 00:35:00.441
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1359
00:35:00.441 --> 00:35:01.100
<v Speaker 2>you really,</v>

1360
00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:01.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1361
00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:03.200
<v Speaker 2>you really get winded.</v>

1362
00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:04.041
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

1363
00:35:04.041 --> 00:35:05.120
<v Speaker 2>your heart rate gets up.</v>

1364
00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:07.130
<v Speaker 2>It's a really good workout and you know,</v>

1365
00:35:07.131 --> 00:35:07.341
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1366
00:35:07.341 --> 00:35:08.570
<v Speaker 2>it feels like honest,</v>

1367
00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.940
<v Speaker 2>like you're really fucking getting some,</v>

1368
00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:13.570
<v Speaker 2>you really doing something and you know,</v>

1369
00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:14.210
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

1370
00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:15.440
<v Speaker 2>and then you get in the boat.</v>

1371
00:35:15.441 --> 00:35:15.921
<v Speaker 2>So I was like,</v>

1372
00:35:15.921 --> 00:35:17.180
<v Speaker 2>I was enjoying it from a,</v>

1373
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:18.380
<v Speaker 2>an an athletic stance.</v>

1374
00:35:18.410 --> 00:35:18.611
<v Speaker 2>How was,</v>

1375
00:35:18.611 --> 00:35:18.940
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1376
00:35:18.940 --> 00:35:19.850
<v Speaker 2>this is a good workout.</v>

1377
00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:21.560
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1378
00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:22.393
<v Speaker 2>there was never warm.</v>

1379
00:35:22.700 --> 00:35:26.000
<v Speaker 2>It never got more than in the 30s it was like the warmest,</v>

1380
00:35:26.001 --> 00:35:28.340
<v Speaker 2>it was probably like 34 35 degrees.</v>

1381
00:35:28.530 --> 00:35:28.870
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1382
00:35:28.870 --> 00:35:29.180
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1383
00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:31.430
<v Speaker 2>every time we were there where water would turn to ice,</v>

1384
00:35:31.431 --> 00:35:32.510
<v Speaker 2>it was always constantly turning.</v>

1385
00:35:32.590 --> 00:35:35.080
<v Speaker 2>The more people there when the summertime is cool.</v>

1386
00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:35.721
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1387
00:35:35.721 --> 00:35:35.931
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1388
00:35:35.931 --> 00:35:36.291
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>

1389
00:35:36.291 --> 00:35:37.124
<v Speaker 2>But that's not,</v>

1390
00:35:37.170 --> 00:35:39.600
<v Speaker 2>the hunting season starts and you want to go deer hunting.</v>

1391
00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:40.291
<v Speaker 2>See this,</v>

1392
00:35:40.291 --> 00:35:41.520
<v Speaker 2>this area is,</v>

1393
00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:45.200
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have a lot of biodiversity according to Steven Rinella.</v>

1394
00:35:45.390 --> 00:35:49.950
<v Speaker 2>But what it does have is it has a lot of certain types of animals that you could</v>

1395
00:35:49.951 --> 00:35:50.730
<v Speaker 2>find.</v>

1396
00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:51.630
<v Speaker 2>And there's not like,</v>

1397
00:35:51.631 --> 00:35:52.980
<v Speaker 2>you don't see a lot of animals,</v>

1398
00:35:52.981 --> 00:35:54.720
<v Speaker 2>but when every now and then you'll see a deer.</v>

1399
00:35:54.721 --> 00:35:56.940
<v Speaker 2>Like there's one in every now and then you'll see a ram.</v>

1400
00:35:56.941 --> 00:35:57.970
<v Speaker 2>We saw a lot of rams.</v>

1401
00:35:58.250 --> 00:35:58.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1402
00:35:58.950 --> 00:35:59.730
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1403
00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:01.530
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking impressive.</v>

1404
00:36:01.860 --> 00:36:02.251
<v Speaker 2>These,</v>

1405
00:36:02.251 --> 00:36:02.610
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1406
00:36:02.610 --> 00:36:04.860
<v Speaker 2>big horn sheep and they're there.</v>

1407
00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:07.290
<v Speaker 2>They're walking across the tops of,</v>

1408
00:36:07.291 --> 00:36:10.770
<v Speaker 2>in the ledges of these mountains and you're watching them just like really,</v>

1409
00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:14.310
<v Speaker 2>really perilous situations and they're walking like,</v>

1410
00:36:14.311 --> 00:36:15.360
<v Speaker 2>they're so sure footed.</v>

1411
00:36:15.361 --> 00:36:16.890
<v Speaker 2>It's really kind of crazy to watch.</v>

1412
00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:19.890
<v Speaker 2>And they're so bad ass curly horns.</v>

1413
00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:20.311
<v Speaker 2>Nah,</v>

1414
00:36:20.311 --> 00:36:21.150
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>

1415
00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:24.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you have to get too close to,</v>

1416
00:36:24.011 --> 00:36:24.500
<v Speaker 2>I blow,</v>

1417
00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:25.860
<v Speaker 2>you shouldn't get close to him.</v>

1418
00:36:25.861 --> 00:36:26.051
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

1419
00:36:26.051 --> 00:36:26.181
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1420
00:36:26.181 --> 00:36:28.080
<v Speaker 2>I think if you're not trying to do something to them,</v>

1421
00:36:28.081 --> 00:36:28.740
<v Speaker 2>they didn't seem,</v>

1422
00:36:28.740 --> 00:36:29.880
<v Speaker 2>seem to be interested in us.</v>

1423
00:36:30.090 --> 00:36:34.710
<v Speaker 2>Apparently that's a really hard animal to get a tag for it to hunt because they</v>

1424
00:36:34.711 --> 00:36:37.380
<v Speaker 2>reintroduced them to Colorado and they built up the,</v>

1425
00:36:37.381 --> 00:36:37.650
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1426
00:36:37.650 --> 00:36:38.483
<v Speaker 2>the numbers.</v>

1427
00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:41.640
<v Speaker 2>And so it's very difficult to get a tag,</v>

1428
00:36:41.670 --> 00:36:43.650
<v Speaker 2>especially where we were to hunt him.</v>

1429
00:36:43.770 --> 00:36:44.790
<v Speaker 2>It's not like when you,</v>

1430
00:36:44.791 --> 00:36:45.571
<v Speaker 2>when you go hunting,</v>

1431
00:36:45.571 --> 00:36:47.490
<v Speaker 2>it's not like everybody can go hunting.</v>

1432
00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:48.900
<v Speaker 2>He like if safe,</v>

1433
00:36:48.901 --> 00:36:49.980
<v Speaker 2>there's certain species,</v>

1434
00:36:49.981 --> 00:36:53.040
<v Speaker 2>it's very hard to get a tag for it even if you live in that state.</v>

1435
00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:54.180
<v Speaker 2>So they only say like,</v>

1436
00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:55.740
<v Speaker 2>let's say only time people can hunt these things.</v>

1437
00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:56.753
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1438
00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:57.840
<v Speaker 2>It's one of those things,</v>

1439
00:36:57.870 --> 00:36:59.850
<v Speaker 2>and you might have a million people that are trying to hunt,</v>

1440
00:37:00.310 --> 00:37:01.110
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1441
00:37:01.110 --> 00:37:05.430
<v Speaker 2>But Deere is one of the ones that you literally have to hunt.</v>

1442
00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:06.720
<v Speaker 2>If you don't hunt deer,</v>

1443
00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:09.210
<v Speaker 2>then they have starvation issues.</v>

1444
00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:11.760
<v Speaker 2>They have overpopulation issues.</v>

1445
00:37:12.020 --> 00:37:16.290
<v Speaker 2>They interfere with traffic that it becomes a real problem if there's roads or</v>

1446
00:37:16.291 --> 00:37:17.040
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>

1447
00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:19.350
<v Speaker 2>or people are driving along because these animals,</v>

1448
00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:20.131
<v Speaker 2>in order to get food,</v>

1449
00:37:20.131 --> 00:37:21.270
<v Speaker 2>they have to travel all over the place.</v>

1450
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:24.210
<v Speaker 2>Now there are a lot of them are nocturnal and they'll run across the road and</v>

1451
00:37:24.211 --> 00:37:24.401
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1452
00:37:24.401 --> 00:37:27.160
<v Speaker 2>there's certain parts of the country right now where if you're driving around</v>

1453
00:37:27.210 --> 00:37:27.871
<v Speaker 2>the road at night,</v>

1454
00:37:27.871 --> 00:37:28.950
<v Speaker 2>it's fucking scary.</v>

1455
00:37:29.430 --> 00:37:30.270
<v Speaker 2>You could slam it.</v>

1456
00:37:30.271 --> 00:37:31.470
<v Speaker 2>A deer's left and right.</v>

1457
00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:31.650
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1458
00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:32.160
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

1459
00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:32.730
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember,</v>

1460
00:37:32.730 --> 00:37:33.900
<v Speaker 2>I think it was Iowa.</v>

1461
00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:38.140
<v Speaker 2>There's some ungodly amount of deer are killed in car accidents every year.</v>

1462
00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.590
<v Speaker 2>It's like 100,000 because it runs into the cause.</v>

1463
00:37:40.591 --> 00:37:41.424
<v Speaker 2>There's so many of them.</v>

1464
00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:41.810
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1465
00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:42.990
<v Speaker 2>they're fucking all over the place.</v>

1466
00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:44.290
<v Speaker 2>And for,</v>

1467
00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:48.000
<v Speaker 2>for people that don't understand how conservation works,</v>

1468
00:37:48.001 --> 00:37:48.930
<v Speaker 2>it's really interesting,</v>

1469
00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:51.000
<v Speaker 2>but the majority of the money,</v>

1470
00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:51.691
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

1471
00:37:51.691 --> 00:37:55.950
<v Speaker 2>all of the money that goes to wildlife groups like,</v>

1472
00:37:55.951 --> 00:37:56.720
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1473
00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:57.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1474
00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:58.171
<v Speaker 2>like the,</v>

1475
00:37:58.171 --> 00:37:58.560
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1476
00:37:58.560 --> 00:37:58.811
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1477
00:37:58.811 --> 00:38:03.210
<v Speaker 2>the groups that put a bag limits on,</v>

1478
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:03.571
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1479
00:38:03.571 --> 00:38:04.404
<v Speaker 2>on hunting,</v>

1480
00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:05.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1481
00:38:05.020 --> 00:38:06.480
<v Speaker 2>whatever the agency,</v>

1482
00:38:06.481 --> 00:38:08.310
<v Speaker 2>whatever name of for the agencies they are.</v>

1483
00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.091
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know what,</v>

1484
00:38:09.091 --> 00:38:09.780
<v Speaker 2>what they would,</v>

1485
00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:10.890
<v Speaker 2>what they call themselves,</v>

1486
00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:12.480
<v Speaker 2>but whatever they are,</v>

1487
00:38:12.481 --> 00:38:13.860
<v Speaker 2>that fishing game,</v>

1488
00:38:13.861 --> 00:38:14.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1489
00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:14.873
<v Speaker 2>whatever that is.</v>

1490
00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.290
<v Speaker 2>But those,</v>

1491
00:38:16.350 --> 00:38:18.360
<v Speaker 2>all their money comes from hunting.</v>

1492
00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:19.140
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>

1493
00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:19.973
<v Speaker 2>all the,</v>

1494
00:38:20.030 --> 00:38:23.250
<v Speaker 2>the money for regulating like the population,</v>

1495
00:38:23.730 --> 00:38:25.800
<v Speaker 2>reintroducing animals that were wiped out,</v>

1496
00:38:25.830 --> 00:38:27.000
<v Speaker 2>all of that comes from hunting.</v>

1497
00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:29.790
<v Speaker 2>And there's some people I can understand their point of view.</v>

1498
00:38:29.791 --> 00:38:32.760
<v Speaker 2>Some people think that we should have no hunting and uh,</v>

1499
00:38:32.761 --> 00:38:33.061
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1500
00:38:33.061 --> 00:38:36.220
<v Speaker 2>that that hunting is cruel and it animals is cruel.</v>

1501
00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:37.321
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

1502
00:38:37.321 --> 00:38:39.760
<v Speaker 2>I can totally understand that point of view too.</v>

1503
00:38:39.761 --> 00:38:42.130
<v Speaker 2>I totally understand animals well,</v>

1504
00:38:42.131 --> 00:38:42.640
<v Speaker 2>I liked,</v>

1505
00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:43.040
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

1506
00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:43.230
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1507
00:38:43.230 --> 00:38:46.530
<v Speaker 2>the type of person that would say you shouldn't kill an animal cause killing</v>

1508
00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:46.870
<v Speaker 2>animals.</v>

1509
00:38:46.870 --> 00:38:48.700
<v Speaker 2>Accrual is a nice person.</v>

1510
00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:51.100
<v Speaker 2>That's a person that wants to be nice to animals.</v>

1511
00:38:51.190 --> 00:38:53.890
<v Speaker 2>So I can't see how I would want to argue with that.</v>

1512
00:38:53.891 --> 00:38:54.071
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1513
00:38:54.071 --> 00:38:55.000
<v Speaker 2>I can see your point.</v>

1514
00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:59.500
<v Speaker 2>But ultimately if I look at it pragmatically,</v>

1515
00:38:59.501 --> 00:39:00.820
<v Speaker 2>my thoughts have always been that,</v>

1516
00:39:00.850 --> 00:39:01.211
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>

1517
00:39:01.211 --> 00:39:04.840
<v Speaker 2>these animals are going to die whether we'd them or whether a coyote eats them</v>

1518
00:39:04.841 --> 00:39:05.860
<v Speaker 2>or amount might need some.</v>

1519
00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:10.930
<v Speaker 2>We found giant mountain lions shits with hair on them with deer hair on him.</v>

1520
00:39:11.110 --> 00:39:11.531
<v Speaker 2>Oh really?</v>

1521
00:39:11.531 --> 00:39:11.741
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1522
00:39:11.741 --> 00:39:12.610
<v Speaker 2>It's really creepy.</v>

1523
00:39:12.640 --> 00:39:14.620
<v Speaker 2>It's really creepy cause you're just thinking this,</v>

1524
00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:17.410
<v Speaker 2>this motherfucker killed this deer with his face.</v>

1525
00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:18.160
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

1526
00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:19.720
<v Speaker 2>Like what a bad ass cat.</v>

1527
00:39:19.721 --> 00:39:20.554
<v Speaker 2>This is juicy.</v>

1528
00:39:20.590 --> 00:39:21.450
<v Speaker 2>That video of a,</v>

1529
00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:23.740
<v Speaker 2>the coyotes get killed getting killed by the wolf's.</v>

1530
00:39:23.741 --> 00:39:24.200
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1531
00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:25.120
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1532
00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:29.030
<v Speaker 2>They rip it apart as don't have hands.</v>

1533
00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:32.470
<v Speaker 2>Well the wild is a very fascinating thing man.</v>

1534
00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:35.980
<v Speaker 2>And being out there for five days with no cell phone,</v>

1535
00:39:35.981 --> 00:39:36.850
<v Speaker 2>no Internet,</v>

1536
00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:37.481
<v Speaker 2>no TV,</v>

1537
00:39:37.481 --> 00:39:38.320
<v Speaker 2>no radio,</v>

1538
00:39:38.470 --> 00:39:41.440
<v Speaker 2>just sleeping outside and eating outside for five days.</v>

1539
00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:42.490
<v Speaker 2>It was very strange.</v>

1540
00:39:42.491 --> 00:39:44.260
<v Speaker 2>And you're stalking an animal.</v>

1541
00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:45.820
<v Speaker 2>You're stalking animals.</v>

1542
00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:47.220
<v Speaker 2>And occasionally we'd see them,</v>

1543
00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:49.320
<v Speaker 2>they were too far away and uh,</v>

1544
00:39:49.330 --> 00:39:51.070
<v Speaker 2>we had to get up wind of them if we were,</v>

1545
00:39:51.071 --> 00:39:51.610
<v Speaker 2>if we were,</v>

1546
00:39:51.610 --> 00:39:52.780
<v Speaker 2>if we were a,</v>

1547
00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:55.780
<v Speaker 2>if we were up wind and the wind was going down to them our way,</v>

1548
00:39:55.840 --> 00:39:56.673
<v Speaker 2>they could smell us.</v>

1549
00:39:56.770 --> 00:40:00.100
<v Speaker 2>So we had to make sure that we were always in a situation where the wind was</v>

1550
00:40:00.101 --> 00:40:01.690
<v Speaker 2>blowing towards us,</v>

1551
00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:03.280
<v Speaker 2>like from the animal to us.</v>

1552
00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:06.100
<v Speaker 2>So at the animal couldn't smell us and we're going to creep up on them.</v>

1553
00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:07.270
<v Speaker 2>You would see it from far,</v>

1554
00:40:07.271 --> 00:40:09.250
<v Speaker 2>far away and then try to track it down.</v>

1555
00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:10.151
<v Speaker 2>We see them from far,</v>

1556
00:40:10.151 --> 00:40:13.030
<v Speaker 2>far away and then we would duck behind things and then we would try to go all</v>

1557
00:40:13.031 --> 00:40:15.820
<v Speaker 2>the way around like that depending on where the wind was.</v>

1558
00:40:15.821 --> 00:40:16.571
<v Speaker 2>It's very important.</v>

1559
00:40:16.571 --> 00:40:19.360
<v Speaker 2>How far down my first vote we smelled so bad.</v>

1560
00:40:19.361 --> 00:40:21.940
<v Speaker 2>We were there with no showers for five days.</v>

1561
00:40:22.210 --> 00:40:22.601
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1562
00:40:22.601 --> 00:40:24.620
<v Speaker 2>So you could smell my ass from Mars.</v>

1563
00:40:26.850 --> 00:40:29.690
<v Speaker 2>Sas must've been terrible heads.</v>

1564
00:40:30.430 --> 00:40:30.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1565
00:40:30.900 --> 00:40:31.160
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

1566
00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:32.620
<v Speaker 2>you're taking shits in these,</v>

1567
00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:34.990
<v Speaker 2>these eco bags.</v>

1568
00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:36.820
<v Speaker 2>It's like the whole thing was horrific.</v>

1569
00:40:37.390 --> 00:40:37.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1570
00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:38.141
<v Speaker 2>Like this,</v>

1571
00:40:38.141 --> 00:40:41.740
<v Speaker 2>this certain type of bag that's for human waste so that you don't like leave</v>

1572
00:40:41.741 --> 00:40:44.560
<v Speaker 2>your shit laying around on the Missouri River.</v>

1573
00:40:44.710 --> 00:40:45.543
<v Speaker 2>As long as their shit,</v>

1574
00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:46.020
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

1575
00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:46.691
<v Speaker 2>what's gross?</v>

1576
00:40:46.691 --> 00:40:47.920
<v Speaker 2>People don't want to step in your shit.</v>

1577
00:40:48.070 --> 00:40:49.390
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile there's cow shit everywhere.</v>

1578
00:40:49.590 --> 00:40:52.060
<v Speaker 2>It's really wild because it's not wild.</v>

1579
00:40:52.061 --> 00:40:55.600
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking deaf human shit of like one of the worst things you could ever</v>

1580
00:40:55.601 --> 00:40:56.171
<v Speaker 2>encounter.</v>

1581
00:40:56.171 --> 00:40:57.004
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1582
00:40:57.550 --> 00:41:01.510
<v Speaker 2>Carb diets are disgusting and none natural filled with preservatives and things</v>

1583
00:41:01.511 --> 00:41:03.460
<v Speaker 2>of fucking ferment inside are assholes.</v>

1584
00:41:03.850 --> 00:41:06.130
<v Speaker 2>And then it comes pouring out and the most wretched smell ever.</v>

1585
00:41:06.131 --> 00:41:08.890
<v Speaker 2>Even dog shit doesn't smell nearly as bad as human shit.</v>

1586
00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:11.690
<v Speaker 2>Human Shit smells dog shit in the house.</v>

1587
00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:14.270
<v Speaker 2>Like I think a dog shit.</v>

1588
00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:16.500
<v Speaker 2>Oh Fuck Ross.</v>

1589
00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:18.030
<v Speaker 5>She go shit.</v>

1590
00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:21.120
<v Speaker 5>Like I had the biggest fogo shit the other day and I put a t I wanted to just</v>

1591
00:41:21.121 --> 00:41:24.870
<v Speaker 5>put a $20 bill on it and not flush it to somebody would try to grab that $20</v>

1592
00:41:24.871 --> 00:41:25.830
<v Speaker 5>bill just to see it.</v>

1593
00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:26.461
<v Speaker 5>Cause you know,</v>

1594
00:41:26.461 --> 00:41:27.294
<v Speaker 5>I don't want him,</v>

1595
00:41:27.650 --> 00:41:27.840
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1596
00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:28.673
<v Speaker 5>I didn't want them.</v>

1597
00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:30.420
<v Speaker 5>We'll take a look.</v>

1598
00:41:30.420 --> 00:41:31.253
<v Speaker 5>Let's try it.</v>

1599
00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:32.093
<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>

1600
00:41:32.670 --> 00:41:33.500
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1601
00:41:33.500 --> 00:41:34.820
<v Speaker 2>so we're out there for,</v>

1602
00:41:36.050 --> 00:41:36.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1603
00:41:36.430 --> 00:41:36.710
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

1604
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:37.251
<v Speaker 2>three days.</v>

1605
00:41:37.251 --> 00:41:41.450
<v Speaker 2>On the third day was when I killed a deer and we were,</v>

1606
00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:44.900
<v Speaker 2>before that we had seen a couple of them but we couldn't get close enough to</v>

1607
00:41:44.901 --> 00:41:45.734
<v Speaker 2>shoot him.</v>

1608
00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:46.101
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>

1609
00:41:46.101 --> 00:41:46.731
<v Speaker 2>How far down?</v>

1610
00:41:46.731 --> 00:41:47.660
<v Speaker 2>When do you have to be?</v>

1611
00:41:47.661 --> 00:41:48.980
<v Speaker 2>Like two miles away.</v>

1612
00:41:48.981 --> 00:41:49.401
<v Speaker 2>You're okay.</v>

1613
00:41:49.401 --> 00:41:50.640
<v Speaker 2>But like how close can,</v>

1614
00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:54.590
<v Speaker 2>you can be close as long as the wind is going from them to you and then it's a</v>

1615
00:41:54.591 --> 00:41:55.401
<v Speaker 2>matter of sound.</v>

1616
00:41:55.401 --> 00:41:56.270
<v Speaker 2>But then if it's not,</v>

1617
00:41:56.330 --> 00:41:57.470
<v Speaker 2>if it's going towards them,</v>

1618
00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:00.530
<v Speaker 2>like how far away do you have to circle around them to get it all depends</v>

1619
00:42:00.531 --> 00:42:02.030
<v Speaker 2>because it's not a distance thing.</v>

1620
00:42:02.031 --> 00:42:06.590
<v Speaker 2>It's a being behind things thing and it's being above them thing you want.</v>

1621
00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:11.860
<v Speaker 2>Ideally you want them below you and you're above from like the top of the hills.</v>

1622
00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:17.750
<v Speaker 2>Will you also be of more shots at them if they have more opportunities?</v>

1623
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:21.590
<v Speaker 2>If they're going like up over the hill and you shoot at them,</v>

1624
00:42:21.591 --> 00:42:23.120
<v Speaker 2>they take off over the top of the hill.</v>

1625
00:42:23.330 --> 00:42:24.200
<v Speaker 2>You didn't know where they're going.</v>

1626
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:25.310
<v Speaker 2>They went left or right.</v>

1627
00:42:25.311 --> 00:42:26.240
<v Speaker 2>You have no idea where they are.</v>

1628
00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:28.400
<v Speaker 2>If you look down on them,</v>

1629
00:42:28.401 --> 00:42:29.600
<v Speaker 2>you could see where they are better.</v>

1630
00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:31.820
<v Speaker 2>So you could scan more area too.</v>

1631
00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.070
<v Speaker 2>It's Kinda hard to figure out where they're going to go.</v>

1632
00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:34.321
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1633
00:42:34.321 --> 00:42:36.500
<v Speaker 2>it's a really interesting thing because it's your,</v>

1634
00:42:36.501 --> 00:42:38.150
<v Speaker 2>you become a part of their world.</v>

1635
00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:38.391
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1636
00:42:38.391 --> 00:42:39.380
<v Speaker 2>you're walking around,</v>

1637
00:42:39.381 --> 00:42:40.610
<v Speaker 2>you'll live in outside.</v>

1638
00:42:40.690 --> 00:42:41.060
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

1639
00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:43.110
<v Speaker 2>you're doing this for several days and you're,</v>

1640
00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:44.990
<v Speaker 2>you're becoming a party's animal's world.</v>

1641
00:42:45.170 --> 00:42:46.430
<v Speaker 2>You don't talk all day,</v>

1642
00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:51.200
<v Speaker 2>all day spent trying to walk as slowly and quietly as possible.</v>

1643
00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:54.470
<v Speaker 2>Stopping every 15 to 20 sites sounds like off scan.</v>

1644
00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:59.560
<v Speaker 2>It just can't relax to scan the horizon to look around for these animals.</v>

1645
00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:00.761
<v Speaker 2>So you're,</v>

1646
00:43:00.761 --> 00:43:03.100
<v Speaker 2>you're doing this all day and um,</v>

1647
00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:03.530
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1648
00:43:03.530 --> 00:43:04.040
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1649
00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:04.873
<v Speaker 2>you're not talking,</v>

1650
00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:05.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1651
00:43:05.390 --> 00:43:06.230
<v Speaker 2>very rarely.</v>

1652
00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:06.711
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1653
00:43:06.711 --> 00:43:06.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1654
00:43:06.891 --> 00:43:07.760
<v Speaker 2>maybe he'll say,</v>

1655
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:08.210
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

1656
00:43:08.210 --> 00:43:10.190
<v Speaker 2>we're going to try over here now on this one.</v>

1657
00:43:10.191 --> 00:43:11.180
<v Speaker 2>Are you tracking anything?</v>

1658
00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:13.250
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes we'll see a lot of tracks.</v>

1659
00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:15.590
<v Speaker 2>You see a lot of a deer footprints.</v>

1660
00:43:15.591 --> 00:43:16.580
<v Speaker 2>We saw elk footprints.</v>

1661
00:43:16.581 --> 00:43:17.411
<v Speaker 2>A lot of Ram flipped,</v>

1662
00:43:17.411 --> 00:43:19.580
<v Speaker 2>but we saw an amazing amount of Ram.</v>

1663
00:43:19.581 --> 00:43:19.851
<v Speaker 2>So it was,</v>

1664
00:43:19.851 --> 00:43:20.511
<v Speaker 2>it was incredible.</v>

1665
00:43:20.511 --> 00:43:21.230
<v Speaker 2>How many of those,</v>

1666
00:43:21.230 --> 00:43:22.100
<v Speaker 2>he's bighorn sheep.</v>

1667
00:43:22.101 --> 00:43:23.480
<v Speaker 2>We saw you following the tracks.</v>

1668
00:43:23.490 --> 00:43:24.323
<v Speaker 2>Are you just walking into,</v>

1669
00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:26.840
<v Speaker 2>so you're following the trails that the deer's traveling,</v>

1670
00:43:26.841 --> 00:43:29.930
<v Speaker 2>cause it deer's traveling trails and then they'll go off into the wooded areas</v>

1671
00:43:29.931 --> 00:43:30.764
<v Speaker 2>to bed down.</v>

1672
00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:32.090
<v Speaker 2>So they get up in the morning.</v>

1673
00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:33.290
<v Speaker 2>Then in the morning they,</v>

1674
00:43:33.291 --> 00:43:33.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1675
00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:36.230
<v Speaker 2>they were up and they get water and eat and they'll,</v>

1676
00:43:36.231 --> 00:43:39.920
<v Speaker 2>they'll stay active for a little while and then they start going in the mid day</v>

1677
00:43:39.921 --> 00:43:42.230
<v Speaker 2>to bed down and then they come out when it gets dark again.</v>

1678
00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:46.850
<v Speaker 2>Like we had one come through our camp while we're sleeping and we heard it.</v>

1679
00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:49.820
<v Speaker 2>You just hear a goal that he gets scared.</v>

1680
00:43:49.821 --> 00:43:50.061
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

1681
00:43:50.061 --> 00:43:53.150
<v Speaker 2>it came through the camp and as it's in this cabinet realize like,</v>

1682
00:43:53.151 --> 00:43:53.691
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

1683
00:43:53.691 --> 00:43:57.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm surrounded by Ogres the monsters at want to eat me right there.</v>

1684
00:43:57.321 --> 00:44:02.321
<v Speaker 2>And it sort of freaks out and starts stomping his feet and a fuck of a 10 if</v>

1685
00:44:02.541 --> 00:44:03.020
<v Speaker 2>they want to.</v>

1686
00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:03.621
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1687
00:44:03.621 --> 00:44:04.011
<v Speaker 2>It could.</v>

1688
00:44:04.011 --> 00:44:04.790
<v Speaker 2>Of course it could,</v>

1689
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:05.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1690
00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:05.361
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1691
00:44:05.361 --> 00:44:06.260
<v Speaker 2>they're not aggressive.</v>

1692
00:44:06.261 --> 00:44:08.150
<v Speaker 2>It's not like they would do that unless they were threatened.</v>

1693
00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:08.810
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1694
00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:09.690
<v Speaker 2>they're there.</v>

1695
00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:11.240
<v Speaker 2>They're clearly prey.</v>

1696
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.960
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1697
00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:13.680
<v Speaker 2>they're clearly there.</v>

1698
00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:16.880
<v Speaker 2>There clearly pray for all these different,</v>

1699
00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:17.540
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1700
00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:19.310
<v Speaker 2>predators like especially mountain lions,</v>

1701
00:44:19.311 --> 00:44:20.330
<v Speaker 2>but humans of course.</v>

1702
00:44:20.570 --> 00:44:22.370
<v Speaker 2>And that's what they're worried about.</v>

1703
00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:24.470
<v Speaker 2>Wolves will be an issue.</v>

1704
00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:26.810
<v Speaker 2>They just want to walk around and they want to fuck.</v>

1705
00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:27.680
<v Speaker 2>That's what it is.</v>

1706
00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:28.450
<v Speaker 2>It's getting close.</v>

1707
00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:29.900
<v Speaker 2>We weren't there during the Rut,</v>

1708
00:44:29.930 --> 00:44:30.530
<v Speaker 2>during the Rut.</v>

1709
00:44:30.530 --> 00:44:34.080
<v Speaker 2>It's really crazy because the deer gets super bold cause they just have hard ons</v>

1710
00:44:34.081 --> 00:44:35.100
<v Speaker 2>and they just want to go fuck.</v>

1711
00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:38.310
<v Speaker 2>And they'll just walk right across the street and like look at you and you can</v>

1712
00:44:38.311 --> 00:44:39.144
<v Speaker 2>blast them.</v>

1713
00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:40.290
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

1714
00:44:40.290 --> 00:44:41.280
<v Speaker 2>it gets to be really,</v>

1715
00:44:41.281 --> 00:44:43.320
<v Speaker 2>it's really like a ruthless trick,</v>

1716
00:44:43.650 --> 00:44:43.891
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1717
00:44:43.891 --> 00:44:44.311
<v Speaker 2>because,</v>

1718
00:44:44.311 --> 00:44:44.670
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1719
00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:45.031
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

1720
00:44:45.031 --> 00:44:45.331
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

1721
00:44:45.331 --> 00:44:46.141
<v Speaker 2>they're being silly.</v>

1722
00:44:46.141 --> 00:44:47.720
<v Speaker 2>So that's why people put the smell of it.</v>

1723
00:44:47.730 --> 00:44:48.990
<v Speaker 2>You're on the female deer.</v>

1724
00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:49.351
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1725
00:44:49.351 --> 00:44:49.620
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1726
00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:50.880
<v Speaker 2>Well they spray it on them.</v>

1727
00:44:50.881 --> 00:44:52.140
<v Speaker 2>They'll spray it on things.</v>

1728
00:44:52.141 --> 00:44:52.381
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1729
00:44:52.381 --> 00:44:52.920
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

1730
00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:54.510
<v Speaker 2>I think some places that's illegal though.</v>

1731
00:44:54.570 --> 00:44:54.811
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1732
00:44:54.811 --> 00:44:58.260
<v Speaker 2>there's different places like didn't have different laws and regulations.</v>

1733
00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:02.070
<v Speaker 2>I learned a lot from hanging out with the Steve Rinella guy was a fascinating</v>

1734
00:45:02.071 --> 00:45:02.280
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

1735
00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:03.240
<v Speaker 2>Should have those rules.</v>

1736
00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:05.820
<v Speaker 2>Like girls shouldn't be able to dress like sluts and that's like our,</v>

1737
00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:07.363
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

1738
00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:08.780
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1739
00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:09.321
<v Speaker 4>absolutely.</v>

1740
00:45:09.321 --> 00:45:10.154
<v Speaker 4>I don't,</v>

1741
00:45:10.380 --> 00:45:11.720
<v Speaker 4>fear comes up and he's like,</v>

1742
00:45:11.721 --> 00:45:11.901
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1743
00:45:11.901 --> 00:45:12.530
<v Speaker 4>can I fuck,</v>

1744
00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:12.711
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1745
00:45:12.711 --> 00:45:14.630
<v Speaker 4>it's some other thing and I can't fuck.</v>

1746
00:45:14.631 --> 00:45:16.460
<v Speaker 4>So of girls were trying to rip you off.</v>

1747
00:45:16.461 --> 00:45:19.370
<v Speaker 4>Like if girls were like professional gold diggers shouldn't be allowed to dress</v>

1748
00:45:19.371 --> 00:45:20.380
<v Speaker 4>like sluts yes.</v>

1749
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.891
<v Speaker 4>To let's,</v>

1750
00:45:20.891 --> 00:45:21.920
<v Speaker 4>you're willing to back it up.</v>

1751
00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:22.790
<v Speaker 4>Hmm.</v>

1752
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:23.623
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1753
00:45:23.870 --> 00:45:24.441
<v Speaker 4>I see your point.</v>

1754
00:45:24.441 --> 00:45:25.340
<v Speaker 4>You are a female deer.</v>

1755
00:45:25.341 --> 00:45:25.521
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1756
00:45:25.521 --> 00:45:26.360
<v Speaker 4>You can make that smell.</v>

1757
00:45:26.361 --> 00:45:27.194
<v Speaker 4>That's okay.</v>

1758
00:45:27.470 --> 00:45:28.310
<v Speaker 4>It seemed like that,</v>

1759
00:45:28.311 --> 00:45:30.260
<v Speaker 4>that would be very stressful.</v>

1760
00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:31.280
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1761
00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:32.900
<v Speaker 4>did you ever get to a point where you're just like,</v>

1762
00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:33.591
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

1763
00:45:33.591 --> 00:45:37.430
<v Speaker 4>I really just want to just yell and tweet and fighting,</v>

1764
00:45:37.431 --> 00:45:37.601
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1765
00:45:37.601 --> 00:45:38.590
<v Speaker 4>like walk around it.</v>

1766
00:45:38.900 --> 00:45:39.340
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1767
00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:39.800
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1768
00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:40.160
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1769
00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:40.470
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1770
00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:41.303
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1771
00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:43.080
<v Speaker 2>I was able to,</v>

1772
00:45:43.081 --> 00:45:43.914
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1773
00:45:44.470 --> 00:45:45.150
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1774
00:45:45.150 --> 00:45:49.830
<v Speaker 2>I was able to sort of accept that this was how we're living for the next few</v>

1775
00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:50.250
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>

1776
00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:50.880
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1777
00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:51.713
<v Speaker 2>I didn't,</v>

1778
00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:51.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1779
00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:53.370
<v Speaker 2>didn't look forward to it ending.</v>

1780
00:45:53.550 --> 00:45:54.331
<v Speaker 2>He didn't bring your phone with,</v>

1781
00:45:54.331 --> 00:45:55.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1782
00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:55.690
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1783
00:45:55.690 --> 00:45:56.371
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't work.</v>

1784
00:45:56.371 --> 00:45:56.791
<v Speaker 2>There's no,</v>

1785
00:45:56.791 --> 00:45:58.140
<v Speaker 2>there's no cell phone reception out there.</v>

1786
00:45:58.170 --> 00:45:58.800
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

1787
00:45:58.800 --> 00:45:59.910
<v Speaker 2>You can't get anything out there.</v>

1788
00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:04.950
<v Speaker 2>But I knew that going in there and it was what I was thinking was like,</v>

1789
00:46:04.951 --> 00:46:08.880
<v Speaker 2>this is going to be an interesting opportunity to sorta get off the grid for a</v>

1790
00:46:08.881 --> 00:46:10.140
<v Speaker 2>little bit and see what that feels like.</v>

1791
00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:15.710
<v Speaker 2>And one of the weird things about getting off the grid for a few days is that,</v>

1792
00:46:16.321 --> 00:46:17.154
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1793
00:46:17.210 --> 00:46:18.240
<v Speaker 2>he got a lot of energy,</v>

1794
00:46:18.241 --> 00:46:19.074
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

1795
00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:23.820
<v Speaker 2>got a lot of energy when you're walking around going after these deer and then</v>

1796
00:46:23.821 --> 00:46:25.120
<v Speaker 2>in between your role and your bone.</v>

1797
00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:27.630
<v Speaker 2>But even when you sit down for a few minutes,</v>

1798
00:46:27.660 --> 00:46:28.050
<v Speaker 2>you don't,</v>

1799
00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:28.890
<v Speaker 2>you're not exhausted.</v>

1800
00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:29.940
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to take a nap.</v>

1801
00:46:30.180 --> 00:46:31.200
<v Speaker 2>Like you have energy.</v>

1802
00:46:31.380 --> 00:46:32.213
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1803
00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:32.551
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1804
00:46:32.551 --> 00:46:35.670
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what people are supposed to be smart phones.</v>

1805
00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:39.480
<v Speaker 2>People were supposed to be working and doing things physically all day.</v>

1806
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:42.240
<v Speaker 2>And when they don't do things physically all day,</v>

1807
00:46:42.330 --> 00:46:43.320
<v Speaker 2>they get exhausted.</v>

1808
00:46:43.470 --> 00:46:44.460
<v Speaker 2>I really believe that.</v>

1809
00:46:44.461 --> 00:46:47.730
<v Speaker 2>I think if you look at our past as when we developed,</v>

1810
00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:48.151
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1811
00:46:48.151 --> 00:46:51.990
<v Speaker 2>to the back the time where people just first started storing foods and</v>

1812
00:46:51.991 --> 00:46:55.530
<v Speaker 2>developing clothes and making weapons and figuring out how to hunt animals.</v>

1813
00:46:55.650 --> 00:46:59.400
<v Speaker 2>We were in motion all day where there were a building shelter or collecting</v>

1814
00:46:59.401 --> 00:47:00.120
<v Speaker 2>food.</v>

1815
00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:03.360
<v Speaker 2>We were in motion all day and I think that's how our,</v>

1816
00:47:03.390 --> 00:47:04.410
<v Speaker 2>that's our default.</v>

1817
00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:09.710
<v Speaker 2>And when we sit down like at a desk and you're sitting in front of a computer or</v>

1818
00:47:09.781 --> 00:47:10.770
<v Speaker 2>you're sitting there and you know,</v>

1819
00:47:10.771 --> 00:47:13.260
<v Speaker 2>just sitting in front of the TV in front of Television,</v>

1820
00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:15.330
<v Speaker 2>I think your body gets confused as fuck.</v>

1821
00:47:15.570 --> 00:47:16.351
<v Speaker 2>I think your body's like,</v>

1822
00:47:16.351 --> 00:47:16.561
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

1823
00:47:16.561 --> 00:47:17.700
<v Speaker 2>we're just not moving.</v>

1824
00:47:17.701 --> 00:47:18.510
<v Speaker 2>So I guess we should.</v>

1825
00:47:18.510 --> 00:47:18.810
<v Speaker 4>Oh like,</v>

1826
00:47:18.810 --> 00:47:19.860
<v Speaker 4>well why would that be a reason?</v>

1827
00:47:19.861 --> 00:47:22.100
<v Speaker 4>It's just not eating.</v>

1828
00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:26.980
<v Speaker 2>That's why I think that being in front of a computer or being in a cubicle,</v>

1829
00:47:26.981 --> 00:47:28.000
<v Speaker 2>like doing that all day,</v>

1830
00:47:28.001 --> 00:47:32.810
<v Speaker 2>like sitting in a desk all day is probably terrible for your body.</v>

1831
00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:34.600
<v Speaker 2>Terrible for you brain.</v>

1832
00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:37.870
<v Speaker 2>How do we do this and fucking surf the web.</v>

1833
00:47:38.110 --> 00:47:40.240
<v Speaker 2>We should go walk even this right now.</v>

1834
00:47:40.370 --> 00:47:41.550
<v Speaker 2>Like we're not doing anything.</v>

1835
00:47:41.551 --> 00:47:41.711
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1836
00:47:41.711 --> 00:47:42.940
<v Speaker 2>but we're having a conversation.</v>

1837
00:47:42.970 --> 00:47:43.400
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1838
00:47:43.400 --> 00:47:45.260
<v Speaker 2>this is the best way to have a conversation is in the,</v>

1839
00:47:45.261 --> 00:47:47.260
<v Speaker 2>in a way that you don't have to think about your body.</v>

1840
00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:47.591
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1841
00:47:47.591 --> 00:47:48.640
<v Speaker 2>you shut it off and relax.</v>

1842
00:47:48.641 --> 00:47:49.480
<v Speaker 2>We were standing up,</v>

1843
00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:49.991
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1844
00:47:49.991 --> 00:47:52.960
<v Speaker 2>we wouldn't be having as cool of a conversation because we would be,</v>

1845
00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:53.823
<v Speaker 2>maybe we should try it.</v>

1846
00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:58.710
<v Speaker 2>We're not walking podcasts where we just go for a nice walk and it's a bad idea.</v>

1847
00:48:01.050 --> 00:48:01.883
<v Speaker 2>This</v>

1848
00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.410
<v Speaker 2>was worse because with this fucking sucks.</v>

1849
00:48:05.411 --> 00:48:06.730
<v Speaker 2>I want to go play Pokemon.</v>

1850
00:48:08.310 --> 00:48:08.680
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1851
00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.290
<v Speaker 2>Mine is this first thing that came to me.</v>

1852
00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:12.010
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1853
00:48:12.010 --> 00:48:13.590
<v Speaker 2>is there a um,</v>

1854
00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:17.800
<v Speaker 2>like a thing that we could get like the big foot got hunter guys do a podcast</v>

1855
00:48:19.050 --> 00:48:21.240
<v Speaker 2>videos of us getting monitoring around Pasa.</v>

1856
00:48:21.241 --> 00:48:21.920
<v Speaker 2>Dena,</v>

1857

<v Speaker 2>you do a blog.</v>

1859
00:48:22.991 --> 00:48:24.220
<v Speaker 2>We could totally do that.</v>

1860
00:48:25.660 --> 00:48:26.021
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1861
00:48:26.021 --> 00:48:26.620
<v Speaker 2>That's a good idea.</v>

1862
00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:29.230
<v Speaker 2>Well to this too pretentious about Griffith Park,</v>

1863
00:48:31.050 --> 00:48:34.180
<v Speaker 2>we would find people that will like put their resumes in front of the fucking</v>

1864
00:48:34.181 --> 00:48:35.014
<v Speaker 2>camera,</v>

1865
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:40.210
<v Speaker 2>such filled with so many fucking douche bags.</v>

1866
00:48:40.211 --> 00:48:40.391
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1867

1869
00:48:42.551 --> 00:48:43.384
<v Speaker 2>Let's go to the zoo.</v>

1870
00:48:43.590 --> 00:48:45.080
<v Speaker 2>I took a lot of photos from this trip.</v>

1874
00:48:57.460 --> 00:48:58.930
<v Speaker 2>was when we were,</v>

00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:00.370
<v Speaker 2>we were,</v>

1877
00:49:00.370 --> 00:49:03.760
<v Speaker 2>we had gone hiking through the morning and then we,</v>

1878
00:49:03.761 --> 00:49:03.971
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1879
00:49:03.971 --> 00:49:04.810
<v Speaker 2>went and looked for deer.</v>

1880
00:49:04.850 --> 00:49:05.320
<v Speaker 2>We didn't,</v>

1881
00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:06.310
<v Speaker 2>we didn't see anything.</v>

1882
00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:07.150
<v Speaker 2>We got,</v>

1883
00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:10.090
<v Speaker 2>we saw a couple of weeks and get close enough to them to get a shot at him.</v>

1884
00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:11.081
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

1885
00:49:11.081 --> 00:49:11.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1886
00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:15.580

00:50:16.871 --> 00:50:17.140
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1929
00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:19.300
<v Speaker 2>he takes these really perilous pass too.</v>

1930
00:50:19.301 --> 00:50:19.900
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

1931
00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:21.010
<v Speaker 2>a lot of times I was like,</v>

1932
00:50:21.011 --> 00:50:21.251
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

1933
00:50:21.251 --> 00:50:25.360
<v Speaker 2>this is like tricky shit because I'm carrying a rifle and I'm carrying a rifle</v>

1934
00:50:25.361 --> 00:50:27.080
<v Speaker 2>and we're climbing up mountains and it's,</v>

1935
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:27.800
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1936
00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:28.041
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1937
00:50:28.041 --> 00:50:28.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1938
00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:29.091
<v Speaker 2>it was no joke,</v>

1939
00:50:29.091 --> 00:50:29.450
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1940
00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:30.283
<v Speaker 2>We did it.</v>

1941
00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:32.720
<v Speaker 2>We did the whole thing the right way.</v>

1942
00:50:32.990 --> 00:50:34.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean it wasn't,</v>

1943
00:50:34.071 --> 00:50:34.520
<v Speaker 2>there was,</v>

1944
00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:37.280
<v Speaker 2>there was this was like a hundred percent wild animal.</v>

1945
00:50:37.430 --> 00:50:41.240
<v Speaker 2>Most likely this deer had never seen a person before was yeah,</v>

1946
00:50:41.241 --> 00:50:41.451
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

1947
00:50:41.451 --> 00:50:43.370
<v Speaker 2>I mean we were in the bad lands of Montana.</v>

1948
00:50:43.371 --> 00:50:44.720
<v Speaker 2>It was like some serious shit,</v>

1949
00:50:44.750 --> 00:50:45.260
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1950
00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:48.740
<v Speaker 2>So we were getting over the top of this Ridge and we,</v>

1951
00:50:48.741 --> 00:50:49.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1952
00:50:49.260 --> 00:50:53.780
<v Speaker 2>we look over and most easiest steer so we have to creep up on it and we have to</v>

1953
00:50:53.781 --> 00:50:57.950
<v Speaker 2>creep up on it and go up wind of it or downwind rather.</v>

1954
00:50:57.951 --> 00:50:58.480
<v Speaker 2>So that it's,</v>

1955
00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:00.920
<v Speaker 2>it's sent is coming to us and ours is coming in.</v>

1956
00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:01.941
<v Speaker 2>And so then,</v>

1957
00:51:01.941 --> 00:51:02.270
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1958
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:03.530
<v Speaker 2>we've got a shot off at it,</v>

1959
00:51:03.950 --> 00:51:04.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1960
00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:05.840
<v Speaker 2>at 200 yards.</v>

1961
00:51:05.841 --> 00:51:07.340
<v Speaker 2>I shot it from 200 yards.</v>

1962
00:51:07.580 --> 00:51:08.413
<v Speaker 2>You killed it.</v>

1963
00:51:09.230 --> 00:51:09.650
<v Speaker 2>How did they,</v>

1964
00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:11.450
<v Speaker 2>how did you know how to use the rifle the right way?</v>

1965
00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:12.313
<v Speaker 2>He showed me how,</v>

1966
00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:13.700
<v Speaker 2>showed me how to days before.</v>

1967
00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:14.301
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty simple.</v>

1968
00:51:14.301 --> 00:51:14.461
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1969
00:51:14.461 --> 00:51:17.120
<v Speaker 2>I shot guns before you standing up or lying down,</v>

1970
00:51:17.121 --> 00:51:17.870
<v Speaker 2>lying down,</v>

1971
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:18.800
<v Speaker 2>lying down on the ground.</v>

1972
00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:19.970
<v Speaker 2>He had a scope and everything,</v>

1973
00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:23.540
<v Speaker 2>you have to correct scope because it was 200 yards away.</v>

1974
00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:25.790
<v Speaker 2>Bullets.</v>

1975
00:51:25.790 --> 00:51:28.280
<v Speaker 2>The gravity hits them so they'll go down the further or so.</v>

1976
00:51:28.281 --> 00:51:31.850
<v Speaker 2>You have to know to aim slightly up if you're 50 yards away or 300 yards away</v>

1977
00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:32.361
<v Speaker 2>and they get,</v>

1978
00:51:32.361 --> 00:51:33.930
<v Speaker 2>the scope is designed for that.</v>

1979
00:51:33.931 --> 00:51:34.071
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1980
00:51:34.071 --> 00:51:35.830
<v Speaker 2>It tells you how far not for,</v>

1981
00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:37.160
<v Speaker 2>not for high powered rifles.</v>

1982
00:51:37.220 --> 00:51:38.450
<v Speaker 2>It takes a long time before they,</v>

1983
00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:41.180
<v Speaker 2>they change trajectory that goes pretty straight for a long time.</v>

1984
00:51:41.450 --> 00:51:43.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like a really serious rifle.</v>

1985
00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:44.060
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1986
00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:46.880
<v Speaker 2>so the deer drops and I didn't even know he dropped.</v>

1987
00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:47.750
<v Speaker 2>Like I shoot it,</v>

1988
00:51:47.751 --> 00:51:48.141
<v Speaker 2>the whole thing.</v>

1989
00:51:48.141 --> 00:51:50.330
<v Speaker 2>It's a really tricky thing like shooting something.</v>

1990
00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:51.680
<v Speaker 2>First of all you're breathing.</v>

1991
00:51:51.681 --> 00:51:52.640
<v Speaker 2>I'm breathing heavy.</v>

1992
00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:53.990
<v Speaker 2>Like we had,</v>

1993
00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:54.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1994
00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:59.060
<v Speaker 2>done all this crazy hiking and my adrenaline is fine cause I'm trying to relax</v>

1995
00:51:59.061 --> 00:52:01.400
<v Speaker 2>and tune in and I don't want to hurt this thing.</v>

1996
00:52:02.630 --> 00:52:05.300
<v Speaker 2>I want to shoot it in the leg and it runs away and we can never catch it again.</v>

1997
00:52:05.301 --> 00:52:05.780
<v Speaker 2>And you know,</v>

1998
00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:06.613
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

1999
00:52:06.710 --> 00:52:07.543
<v Speaker 2>And bleeds out.</v>

2000
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:09.410
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to just,</v>

2001
00:52:09.470 --> 00:52:10.490
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to do it correctly,</v>

2002
00:52:10.491 --> 00:52:13.490
<v Speaker 2>so I wanted to make sure that I had a good shot and I dropped it with the first</v>

2003
00:52:13.491 --> 00:52:14.210
<v Speaker 2>shot.</v>

2004
00:52:14.210 --> 00:52:15.110
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't dead.</v>

2005
00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:15.860
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2006
00:52:15.860 --> 00:52:16.670
<v Speaker 2>I had to kill it.</v>

2007
00:52:16.670 --> 00:52:17.930
<v Speaker 2>I had to drop it,</v>

2008
00:52:17.931 --> 00:52:18.764
<v Speaker 2>hit it with a c.</v>

2009
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:19.880
<v Speaker 2>No he was,</v>

2010
00:52:19.940 --> 00:52:20.773
<v Speaker 2>he was going to die.</v>

2011
00:52:21.110 --> 00:52:24.020
<v Speaker 2>It shot him through like right above,</v>

2012
00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:24.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2013
00:52:24.380 --> 00:52:25.213
<v Speaker 2>like his heart.</v>

2014
00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:26.540
<v Speaker 2>And so it would have taken,</v>

2015
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:29.630
<v Speaker 2>he like hit his spine or we Amy for the heart of the head.</v>

2016
00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:30.740
<v Speaker 2>He aimed for the heart.</v>

2017
00:52:31.220 --> 00:52:34.520
<v Speaker 2>And so then you have to walk up to it or shot it again and write their shot it</v>

2018
00:52:34.521 --> 00:52:35.360
<v Speaker 2>from a distance.</v>

2019
00:52:35.570 --> 00:52:37.160
<v Speaker 2>How far was pretty close?</v>

2020
00:52:37.220 --> 00:52:37.610
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>

2021
00:52:37.610 --> 00:52:41.840
<v Speaker 2>I got pretty close to make sure that I didn't miss 10 feet no further than that.</v>

2022
00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:45.280
<v Speaker 2>Like 20 with the rifle again with the rifle and then I,</v>

2023
00:52:45.281 --> 00:52:46.160
<v Speaker 2>I finished it.</v>

2024
00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:46.681
<v Speaker 2>It was a,</v>

2025
00:52:46.681 --> 00:52:47.840
<v Speaker 2>it was very intense man.</v>

2026
00:52:47.890 --> 00:52:49.780
<v Speaker 2>Cause then right after that then we're,</v>

2027
00:52:49.781 --> 00:52:52.190
<v Speaker 2>we're gutting it and it's hot.</v>

2028
00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:53.413
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2029
00:52:53.450 --> 00:52:54.240
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2030
00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:54.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2031
00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:55.071
<v Speaker 2>and I made,</v>

2032
00:52:55.071 --> 00:52:59.090
<v Speaker 2>I made like a real conscious decision to do this and I know I got a lot of</v>

2033
00:52:59.091 --> 00:53:01.280
<v Speaker 2>criticism from a lot of people that said you shouldn't go hunting.</v>

2034
00:53:01.281 --> 00:53:02.300
<v Speaker 2>You shouldn't kill something.</v>

2035
00:53:02.301 --> 00:53:03.500
<v Speaker 2>This is like so hard.</v>

2036
00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:04.941
<v Speaker 2>But here's,</v>

2037
00:53:04.941 --> 00:53:05.870
<v Speaker 2>here's the issue.</v>

2038
00:53:06.010 --> 00:53:08.570
<v Speaker 2>And it's like a lot of these people that I'm talking to you that were in leather</v>

2039
00:53:08.571 --> 00:53:09.404
<v Speaker 2>shoes,</v>

2040
00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:10.393
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2041
00:53:10.410 --> 00:53:11.570
<v Speaker 2>you got leather in your car,</v>

2042
00:53:11.571 --> 00:53:12.530
<v Speaker 2>interior,</v>

2043
00:53:12.531 --> 00:53:12.801
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2044
00:53:12.801 --> 00:53:15.130
<v Speaker 2>you eat burgers and you've got no problem with it.</v>

2045
00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:16.200
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

2046
00:53:16.200 --> 00:53:18.470
<v Speaker 2>my shop until they find out the iPhone is made of one.</v>

2047
00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:19.880
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2048
00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:21.820
<v Speaker 2>this is my point of view and I don't want it,</v>

2049
00:53:21.830 --> 00:53:23.510
<v Speaker 2>it's not that I want to kill animals.</v>

2050
00:53:23.511 --> 00:53:24.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm like a mean person.</v>

2051
00:53:24.651 --> 00:53:25.484
<v Speaker 2>I want to out and,</v>

2052
00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:26.341
<v Speaker 2>and kill these,</v>

2053
00:53:26.341 --> 00:53:27.450
<v Speaker 2>these beautiful animals.</v>

2054
00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:30.900
<v Speaker 2>But I eat meat and uh,</v>

2055
00:53:30.901 --> 00:53:35.280
<v Speaker 2>I've eaten meat my whole life and I've taken no responsibility for how that meat</v>

2056
00:53:35.310 --> 00:53:36.150
<v Speaker 2>is acquired.</v>

2057
00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:37.040
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2058
00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:40.020
<v Speaker 2>I read all this shit about farming and I don't,</v>

2059
00:53:40.021 --> 00:53:41.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be attached to that.</v>

2060
00:53:41.530 --> 00:53:41.820
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2061
00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:44.580
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be attached to be to factory farming.</v>

2062
00:53:44.610 --> 00:53:44.871
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2063
00:53:44.871 --> 00:53:45.760
<v Speaker 2>And means a huge difference.</v>

2064
00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:47.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be attached to,</v>

2065
00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:48.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2066
00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:48.691
<v Speaker 2>to these,</v>

2067
00:53:48.691 --> 00:53:49.050
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

2068
00:53:49.050 --> 00:53:50.550
<v Speaker 2>the way they treat animals where they,</v>

2069
00:53:50.790 --> 00:53:51.060
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2070
00:53:51.060 --> 00:53:53.850
<v Speaker 2>they essentially have them live their entire lives,</v>

2071
00:53:53.851 --> 00:53:55.170
<v Speaker 2>tortured in cages,</v>

2072
00:53:55.410 --> 00:53:59.430
<v Speaker 2>feeding shit food that their body can't even digest to fatten them up and then</v>

2073
00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:02.070
<v Speaker 2>then we kill them and eat them and then you just pick it up at the supermarket.</v>

2074
00:54:02.250 --> 00:54:04.560
<v Speaker 2>Completely detached from the process.</v>

2075
00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:05.790
<v Speaker 2>It just is meat,</v>

2076
00:54:06.270 --> 00:54:06.661
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2077
00:54:06.661 --> 00:54:07.890
<v Speaker 2>And so I,</v>

2078
00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:10.860
<v Speaker 2>I knew coming in that this is going to be a weird experience.</v>

2079
00:54:10.861 --> 00:54:12.040
<v Speaker 2>Like how was I going to address this?</v>

2080
00:54:12.050 --> 00:54:12.883
<v Speaker 2>What was I going to,</v>

2081
00:54:12.890 --> 00:54:13.980
<v Speaker 2>was I going to,</v>

2082
00:54:14.010 --> 00:54:14.843
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2083
00:54:15.290 --> 00:54:17.250
<v Speaker 2>like was I going to enjoy this?</v>

2084
00:54:17.251 --> 00:54:21.420
<v Speaker 2>Was I going to feel terrible and become a vegetarian?</v>

2085
00:54:21.950 --> 00:54:25.020
<v Speaker 2>Wha How was my reaction to it when you walked up to her,</v>

2086
00:54:25.050 --> 00:54:28.770
<v Speaker 2>how'd you feel when it was dead before you shot the second time?</v>

2087
00:54:29.700 --> 00:54:30.480
<v Speaker 2>I have to kill it.</v>

2088
00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:32.040
<v Speaker 2>You could see it close enough to know.</v>

2089
00:54:32.041 --> 00:54:33.860
<v Speaker 2>It's like actually breathing and stuff with your hearing.</v>

2090
00:54:33.990 --> 00:54:34.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2091
00:54:34.320 --> 00:54:34.860
<v Speaker 2>You can hear it.</v>

2092
00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:35.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2093
00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:35.980
<v Speaker 2>What was he doing?</v>

2094
00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:37.190
<v Speaker 2>Just struggling.</v>

2095
00:54:37.210 --> 00:54:37.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2096
00:54:37.450 --> 00:54:38.283
<v Speaker 2>I'm struggling.</v>

2097
00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:39.720
<v Speaker 2>Who wasn't moving much?</v>

2098
00:54:39.721 --> 00:54:39.871
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2099
00:54:39.871 --> 00:54:40.051
<v Speaker 2>he like,</v>

2100
00:54:40.051 --> 00:54:41.040
<v Speaker 2>he was going to die soon,</v>

2101
00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:43.920
<v Speaker 2>but I had to make sure that I took care of it right there.</v>

2102
00:54:44.610 --> 00:54:44.971
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2103
00:54:44.971 --> 00:54:45.804
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2104
00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:46.441
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2105
00:54:46.441 --> 00:54:46.681
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

2106
00:54:46.681 --> 00:54:47.040
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2107
00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:47.873
<v Speaker 2>it's uh,</v>

2108
00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:49.050
<v Speaker 2>it's very strange.</v>

2109
00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:49.351
<v Speaker 2>The whole,</v>

2110
00:54:49.351 --> 00:54:50.730
<v Speaker 2>the whole experience is very strange.</v>

2111
00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:51.930
<v Speaker 2>The whole experience of,</v>

2112
00:54:51.931 --> 00:54:55.170
<v Speaker 2>of tracking them down a strange knowing that you're tracking them down to</v>

2113
00:54:55.171 --> 00:54:56.220
<v Speaker 2>eventually eat them,</v>

2114
00:54:56.550 --> 00:54:56.791
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2115
00:54:56.791 --> 00:54:58.260
<v Speaker 2>And then when you're actually eating it,</v>

2116
00:54:58.320 --> 00:54:58.681
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

2117
00:54:58.681 --> 00:54:58.921
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2118
00:54:58.921 --> 00:55:03.921
<v Speaker 2>that that night we sat around the campfire and we cooked liver and the heart and</v>

2119
00:55:04.051 --> 00:55:05.040
<v Speaker 2>the kidneys.</v>

2120
00:55:05.490 --> 00:55:06.590
<v Speaker 2>Did you get it backwards?</v>

2121
00:55:06.591 --> 00:55:07.424
<v Speaker 2>You can't fair?</v>

2122
00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:08.011
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2123
00:55:08.011 --> 00:55:08.520
<v Speaker 2>we had to,</v>

2124
00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:09.480
<v Speaker 2>we had to bring it back.</v>

2125
00:55:09.570 --> 00:55:10.710
<v Speaker 2>How'd you carry it back?</v>

2126
00:55:10.750 --> 00:55:11.520
<v Speaker 2>You've cut it up,</v>

2127
00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:13.080
<v Speaker 2>cut it up first and everyone's texted pace.</v>

2128
00:55:13.110 --> 00:55:13.261
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2129
00:55:13.261 --> 00:55:14.190
<v Speaker 2>we did the first night.</v>

2130
00:55:14.191 --> 00:55:14.880
<v Speaker 2>We took the,</v>

2131
00:55:14.880 --> 00:55:15.151
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2132
00:55:15.151 --> 00:55:17.970
<v Speaker 2>the organs out that we could use that you'd eat.</v>

2133
00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:19.530
<v Speaker 2>You don't eat all the organs,</v>

2134
00:55:19.531 --> 00:55:22.260
<v Speaker 2>which you eat the liver and eat the heart and you eat the kidneys.</v>

2135
00:55:22.710 --> 00:55:24.120
<v Speaker 2>And so we took all that stuff.</v>

2136
00:55:24.130 --> 00:55:24.460
<v Speaker 2>What have you,</v>

2137
00:55:24.460 --> 00:55:25.650
<v Speaker 2>or the rest of the word we,</v>

2138
00:55:25.690 --> 00:55:26.000
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2139
00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:28.650
<v Speaker 2>we pulled it out and we were going to use it for cat fish bait,</v>

2140
00:55:28.980 --> 00:55:32.310
<v Speaker 2>but you just leave it there and we want to believing it there and other animals.</v>

2141
00:55:32.311 --> 00:55:32.820
<v Speaker 2>We eat it.</v>

2142
00:55:32.820 --> 00:55:33.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2143
00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:36.660
<v Speaker 2>Like almost immediately the ravens were find it and when the ravens find it,</v>

2144
00:55:36.661 --> 00:55:37.161
<v Speaker 2>then the,</v>

2145
00:55:37.161 --> 00:55:38.040
<v Speaker 2>the coyotes,</v>

2146
00:55:38.041 --> 00:55:40.530
<v Speaker 2>we'll figure out where the ravens are and the coyotes will go to there.</v>

2147
00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:44.160
<v Speaker 2>It's like nature has us really efficient system of cleaning out.</v>

2148
00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:45.061
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2149
00:55:45.061 --> 00:55:46.290
<v Speaker 2>So it's really amazing.</v>

2150
00:55:46.990 --> 00:55:48.820
<v Speaker 2>So we leave the Oregons um,</v>

2151
00:55:48.930 --> 00:55:53.250
<v Speaker 2>take the edible organs and then leave the body overnight because it takes a few</v>

2152
00:55:53.250 --> 00:55:55.380
<v Speaker 2>hours to part it up and okay.</v>

2153
00:55:55.410 --> 00:55:56.500
<v Speaker 2>To clean it and parking lot.</v>

2154
00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:57.300
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2155
00:55:57.300 --> 00:55:58.530
<v Speaker 2>it's 30 degrees outside,</v>

2156
00:55:58.531 --> 00:55:58.910
<v Speaker 2>so it's like,</v>

2157
00:55:58.910 --> 00:55:59.140
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2158
00:55:59.140 --> 00:55:59.731
<v Speaker 2>A frigerator.</v>

2159
00:55:59.731 --> 00:56:01.920
<v Speaker 2>So you tie it up to make sure that nothing can get to it,</v>

2160
00:56:01.921 --> 00:56:03.210
<v Speaker 2>but there's no insects there.</v>

2161
00:56:03.210 --> 00:56:04.043
<v Speaker 2>Everything's</v>

2162
00:56:05.370 --> 00:56:06.203
<v Speaker 2>warm.</v>

2163
00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:08.220
<v Speaker 2>You couldn't have done that or what's,</v>

2164
00:56:08.221 --> 00:56:08.660
<v Speaker 2>what's the deal?</v>

2165
00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:08.840
<v Speaker 2>Can,</v>

2166
00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:09.900
<v Speaker 2>you know you couldn't do that?</v>

2167
00:56:09.901 --> 00:56:11.610
<v Speaker 2>You can't leave the meat out if it's hot out.</v>

2168
00:56:11.611 --> 00:56:11.731
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2169
00:56:11.731 --> 00:56:13.290
<v Speaker 2>if it's in Texas in August,</v>

2170
00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:16.470
<v Speaker 2>you should have your hat like that because they always kill it.</v>

2171
00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:17.970
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't like go straight to her fridge.</v>

2172
00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:18.900
<v Speaker 2>That's a good question.</v>

2173
00:56:19.020 --> 00:56:21.210
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how long you have some time,</v>

2174
00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:22.410
<v Speaker 2>but if it's hot out,</v>

2175
00:56:22.411 --> 00:56:23.890
<v Speaker 2>you don't have as much time.</v>

2176
00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:25.710
<v Speaker 2>That's when people sell things to preserve them,</v>

2177
00:56:25.711 --> 00:56:26.544
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2178
00:56:26.620 --> 00:56:27.453
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2179
00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:27.821
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2180
00:56:27.821 --> 00:56:28.420
<v Speaker 2>But that's uh,</v>

2181
00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:28.781
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2182
00:56:28.781 --> 00:56:30.490
<v Speaker 2>that's not what they do with wild game.</v>

2183
00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:32.370
<v Speaker 2>That's what they used to do with meat back then.</v>

2184
00:56:32.371 --> 00:56:33.550
<v Speaker 2>I didn't have refrigerators.</v>

2185
00:56:33.730 --> 00:56:35.830
<v Speaker 2>I don't really totally understand how that works either,</v>

2186
00:56:36.220 --> 00:56:40.060
<v Speaker 2>but maybe bacteria doesn't live on the surface with the salt or something.</v>

2187
00:56:40.061 --> 00:56:40.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2188
00:56:40.750 --> 00:56:41.860
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

2189
00:56:42.310 --> 00:56:44.260
<v Speaker 2>so it was so cold out.</v>

2190
00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:45.250
<v Speaker 2>We just left it there.</v>

2191
00:56:45.280 --> 00:56:45.971
<v Speaker 2>You can leave it there.</v>

2192
00:56:45.971 --> 00:56:48.790
<v Speaker 2>It's like leaving in the fridgerator and then wa it was like a mile from the</v>

2193
00:56:48.791 --> 00:56:49.181
<v Speaker 2>camp.</v>

2194
00:56:49.181 --> 00:56:51.940
<v Speaker 2>So then we had to walk back from the camp.</v>

2195
00:56:52.060 --> 00:56:53.710
<v Speaker 2>Kenyon k yeah.</v>

2196
00:56:53.711 --> 00:56:55.300
<v Speaker 2>We had to take it apart.</v>

2197
00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:56.080
<v Speaker 2>How much of that,</v>

2198
00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:59.010
<v Speaker 2>how much that buck way or it was about 180 pounds.</v>

2199
00:56:59.260 --> 00:57:00.021
<v Speaker 2>180 pounds.</v>

2200
00:57:00.021 --> 00:57:01.270
<v Speaker 2>So you guys had to just put that up.</v>

2201
00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:01.841
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2202
00:57:01.841 --> 00:57:03.580
<v Speaker 2>We had to chop it out at 40 14 carried out.</v>

2203
00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:04.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2204
00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:05.050
<v Speaker 2>it was a lot of work.</v>

2205
00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:06.281
<v Speaker 2>That was a,</v>

2206
00:57:06.281 --> 00:57:08.890
<v Speaker 2>that was the most difficult than was carrying the,</v>

2207
00:57:08.891 --> 00:57:09.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2208
00:57:09.250 --> 00:57:09.790
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2209
00:57:09.790 --> 00:57:10.360
<v Speaker 2>the uh,</v>

2210
00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:10.930
<v Speaker 2>buck back.</v>

2211
00:57:10.930 --> 00:57:11.660
<v Speaker 2>I actually know,</v>

2212
00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:12.011
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2213
00:57:12.011 --> 00:57:13.660
<v Speaker 2>all the hiking together,</v>

2214
00:57:13.661 --> 00:57:14.740
<v Speaker 2>all of it was pretty hard.</v>

2215
00:57:14.830 --> 00:57:17.740
<v Speaker 2>It was the really slippery slopes are probably the hardest thing,</v>

2216
00:57:17.890 --> 00:57:20.740
<v Speaker 2>but the most difficult thing is staying calm and shooting the animal and then</v>

2217
00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:21.550
<v Speaker 2>making a decision.</v>

2218
00:57:21.550 --> 00:57:21.641
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2219
00:57:21.641 --> 00:57:22.660
<v Speaker 2>is this really what you want to do?</v>

2220
00:57:22.930 --> 00:57:23.500
<v Speaker 2>Like what do you do?</v>

2221
00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:24.340
<v Speaker 2>You've already made that decision.</v>

2222
00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:25.570
<v Speaker 2>But I wanted to know,</v>

2223
00:57:25.571 --> 00:57:27.290
<v Speaker 2>I wanted to look the,</v>

2224
00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:31.240
<v Speaker 2>the detachment that a normal person has an eats meat.</v>

2225
00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:33.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't necessarily think that's healthy.</v>

2226
00:57:34.090 --> 00:57:35.700
<v Speaker 2>I think that we have,</v>

2227
00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:36.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2228
00:57:36.460 --> 00:57:41.460
<v Speaker 2>we've removed what it is from our heads and we're just acquiring meat.</v>

2229
00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:44.530
<v Speaker 2>We're just going to a supermarket and acquiring meat.</v>

2230
00:57:44.890 --> 00:57:45.340
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2231
00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:48.130
<v Speaker 2>I think that that lack of connection.</v>

2232
00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:50.261
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2233
00:57:50.261 --> 00:57:51.940
<v Speaker 2>I think ultimately it's not,</v>

2234
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:55.510
<v Speaker 2>it's not healthy and I think it's not natural.</v>

2235
00:57:55.570 --> 00:57:56.470
<v Speaker 2>I think it's weird.</v>

2236
00:57:56.471 --> 00:57:57.111
<v Speaker 2>It's like being in the,</v>

2237
00:57:57.111 --> 00:57:58.130
<v Speaker 2>know where the food comes from.</v>

2238
00:57:58.131 --> 00:57:59.920
<v Speaker 2>It's like being born rich or something,</v>

2239
00:57:59.921 --> 00:58:00.131
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2240
00:58:00.131 --> 00:58:01.060
<v Speaker 2>It's like you don't,</v>

2241
00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:03.460
<v Speaker 2>you don't really appreciate it or understand it.</v>

2242
00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:06.250
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean they're just grab food that somebody else killed?</v>

2243
00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:07.031
<v Speaker 2>They killed things too,</v>

2244
00:58:07.031 --> 00:58:07.740
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

2245
00:58:07.740 --> 00:58:08.141
<v Speaker 2>They're out there.</v>

2246
00:58:08.141 --> 00:58:09.130
<v Speaker 2>That's a hard scrabble life.</v>

2247
00:58:09.131 --> 00:58:10.780
<v Speaker 2>You can't be picky and choosy when your coyote,</v>

2248
00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.630
<v Speaker 2>but I mean is that like the idea of going to a supermarket and everything's</v>

2249
00:58:13.631 --> 00:58:18.160
<v Speaker 2>prayer prepared and packaged for you about shots of the animal?</v>

2250
00:58:18.161 --> 00:58:20.030
<v Speaker 2>Like a photo of me when I was,</v>

2251
00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:22.900
<v Speaker 2>maybe this is me at one years old,</v>

2252
00:58:22.901 --> 00:58:23.850
<v Speaker 2>just learn how to walk.</v>

2253
00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:25.660
<v Speaker 2>I feel like now when you buy the meat you won't,</v>

2254
00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:27.430
<v Speaker 2>you'll put up appreciate it more.</v>

2255
00:58:27.490 --> 00:58:27.671
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2256
00:58:27.671 --> 00:58:29.820
<v Speaker 2>I have a lot of deer meat to eat and that that,</v>

2257
00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:31.600
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

2258
00:58:31.870 --> 00:58:32.560
<v Speaker 2>did you like it?</v>

2259
00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:32.831
<v Speaker 2>You like,</v>

2260
00:58:32.831 --> 00:58:33.664
<v Speaker 2>it's delicious.</v>

2261
00:58:34.030 --> 00:58:35.200
<v Speaker 2>The best meat you can eat.</v>

2262
00:58:35.530 --> 00:58:38.890
<v Speaker 2>So now they say you want to get it clean so it doesn't taste the game because it</v>

2263
00:58:38.891 --> 00:58:41.260
<v Speaker 2>released that testosterone or whatever it is for adrenaline.</v>

2264
00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:43.180
<v Speaker 2>Once you hit it before you kill it.</v>

2265
00:58:43.240 --> 00:58:43.601
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2266
00:58:43.601 --> 00:58:45.820
<v Speaker 2>they're going to have adrenaline no matter what,</v>

2267
00:58:45.821 --> 00:58:46.150
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2268
00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:46.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2269
00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:47.950
<v Speaker 2>if it doesn't die instantly,</v>

2270
00:58:48.190 --> 00:58:49.390
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't taste bad,</v>

2271
00:58:49.630 --> 00:58:49.901
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2272
00:58:49.901 --> 00:58:50.111
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2273
00:58:50.111 --> 00:58:50.351
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2274
00:58:50.351 --> 00:58:51.970
<v Speaker 2>it's a really lean,</v>

2275
00:58:51.971 --> 00:58:52.870
<v Speaker 2>delicious meat.</v>

2276
00:58:53.080 --> 00:58:53.620
<v Speaker 2>It tastes,</v>

2277
00:58:53.620 --> 00:58:54.670
<v Speaker 2>it tastes really good.</v>

2278
00:58:55.510 --> 00:58:56.140
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2279
00:58:56.140 --> 00:58:57.220
<v Speaker 2>for a lot of people,</v>

2280
00:58:57.250 --> 00:58:59.350
<v Speaker 2>they have a problem with killing things.</v>

2281
00:58:59.351 --> 00:58:59.551
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2282
00:58:59.551 --> 00:59:00.060
<v Speaker 2>I get it.</v>

2283
00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:02.080
<v Speaker 2>You eat meat but you don't like killing things.</v>

2284
00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:03.400
<v Speaker 2>And I understand that.</v>

2285
00:59:03.610 --> 00:59:04.450
<v Speaker 2>But I think,</v>

2286
00:59:04.451 --> 00:59:04.900
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2287
00:59:04.900 --> 00:59:06.290
<v Speaker 2>being upset at someone,</v>

2288
00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:07.010
<v Speaker 2>be upset,</v>

2289
00:59:07.010 --> 00:59:09.490
<v Speaker 2>being upset at someone for killing something that they eat,</v>

2290
00:59:09.730 --> 00:59:11.410
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a little bit hypocritical,</v>

2291
00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:13.930
<v Speaker 2>not a little bit ridiculously hypocritical.</v>

2292
00:59:13.931 --> 00:59:14.201
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2293
00:59:14.201 --> 00:59:15.520
<v Speaker 2>and it's also a stupid,</v>

2294
00:59:15.850 --> 00:59:16.300
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2295
00:59:16.300 --> 00:59:16.681
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>

2296
00:59:16.681 --> 00:59:19.470
<v Speaker 2>we're not being honest about what our,</v>

2297
00:59:19.620 --> 00:59:20.230
<v Speaker 2>as,</v>

2298
00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:21.160
<v Speaker 2>as an organism,</v>

2299
00:59:21.230 --> 00:59:21.980
<v Speaker 2>we're not being honest</v>

2300
00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:23.090
<v Speaker 1>about what we are as an organism.</v>

2301
00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:24.350
<v Speaker 1>If you're mad at people that hunt,</v>

2302
00:59:24.590 --> 00:59:26.840
<v Speaker 1>because every fucking restaurant you go to,</v>

2303
00:59:26.860 --> 00:59:28.910
<v Speaker 1>ever way you look has murdered animals in it.</v>

2304
00:59:29.210 --> 00:59:30.050
<v Speaker 1>That's everywhere.</v>

2305
00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:31.250
<v Speaker 1>You learn something different though,</v>

2306
00:59:31.251 --> 00:59:34.880
<v Speaker 1>to be part of the killing as opposed to being okay with the killing going on.</v>

2307
00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:35.360
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2308
00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:37.790
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to be an execution or where you can believe in capital</v>

2309
00:59:37.970 --> 00:59:38.750
<v Speaker 1>punishment.</v>

2310
00:59:38.750 --> 00:59:39.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2311
00:59:39.111 --> 00:59:41.240
<v Speaker 1>Gas If you weren't eating the prisoners,</v>

2312
00:59:41.241 --> 00:59:42.110
<v Speaker 1>FTA killed them.</v>

2313
00:59:42.290 --> 00:59:44.390
<v Speaker 1>But I'm saying you don't have to be the one doing the killing.</v>

2314
00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2315
00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:48.180
<v Speaker 1>Difference between doing the killing and just being okay with people were</v>

2316
00:59:48.181 --> 00:59:49.014
<v Speaker 1>getting murdered.</v>

2317
00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:52.220
<v Speaker 1>I don't think the capital punishment argument works because you don't need</v>

2318
00:59:52.221 --> 00:59:53.780
<v Speaker 1>capital punishment for sustenance.</v>

2319
00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:55.090
<v Speaker 1>You need,</v>

2320
00:59:55.090 --> 00:59:55.923
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2321
00:59:56.150 --> 00:59:58.190
<v Speaker 1>you don't need meat either as people that exist.</v>

2322
00:59:58.191 --> 00:59:59.090
<v Speaker 1>I'm being a vegetarian,</v>

2323
00:59:59.091 --> 01:00:00.290
<v Speaker 1>but if you're consuming me,</v>

2324
01:00:00.291 --> 01:00:03.080
<v Speaker 1>you're eating it and you know that is a part of your diet.</v>

2325
01:00:03.110 --> 01:00:04.730
<v Speaker 1>That's your part of your everyday dot.</v>

2326
01:00:04.731 --> 01:00:08.870
<v Speaker 1>Yet we have no connection with that and that was the issue that I had.</v>

2327
01:00:08.871 --> 01:00:09.321
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2328
01:00:09.321 --> 01:00:09.531
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2329
01:00:09.531 --> 01:00:12.800
<v Speaker 1>I feel like I just as a human going through this life,</v>

2330
01:00:12.830 --> 01:00:14.330
<v Speaker 1>if I'm going to continue to eat meat,</v>

2331
01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:16.370
<v Speaker 1>I should take apart in the process.</v>

2332
01:00:16.940 --> 01:00:19.480
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to start a farm and go kill a pig on a farm.</v>

2333
01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:21.790
<v Speaker 1>No part of you want to just go to a photo farm insight.</v>

2334
01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:22.431
<v Speaker 1>Let's just do that.</v>

2335
01:00:22.431 --> 01:00:22.701
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

2336
01:00:22.701 --> 01:00:27.680
<v Speaker 1>When I think the best way is this animal lives at totally natural wildlife and</v>

2337
01:00:27.681 --> 01:00:28.730
<v Speaker 1>then boom,</v>

2338
01:00:28.970 --> 01:00:29.760
<v Speaker 1>it gets shot.</v>

2339
01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:30.830
<v Speaker 1>Can just make an argument for them.</v>

2340
01:00:30.970 --> 01:00:31.850
<v Speaker 1>Cause I think it's fine.</v>

2341
01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:33.073
<v Speaker 1>I don't care at all,</v>

2342
01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:33.973
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

2343
01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:35.540
<v Speaker 1>that deer would not have died.</v>

2344
01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:37.670
<v Speaker 1>You don't know that you're wrong.</v>

2345
01:00:38.570 --> 01:00:39.231
<v Speaker 1>Most of them,</v>

2346
01:00:39.231 --> 01:00:40.520
<v Speaker 1>most of them die.</v>

2347
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.600
<v Speaker 1>Either they get killed by predators or they die because it gets cold out.</v>

2348
01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:45.010
<v Speaker 1>That happens.</v>

2349
01:00:45.010 --> 01:00:45.771
<v Speaker 1>It's out eventually,</v>

2350
01:00:45.771 --> 01:00:46.640
<v Speaker 1>but when it died right then,</v>

2351
01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:47.900
<v Speaker 1>but if you go to a farm,</v>

2352
01:00:47.901 --> 01:00:50.270
<v Speaker 1>but there's killing cows that that would have died,</v>

2353
01:00:50.271 --> 01:00:52.130
<v Speaker 1>right then just you're doing it.</v>

2354
01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:55.910
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't that be more of taking apart in the process?</v>

2355
01:00:55.970 --> 01:00:56.840
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you're saying.</v>

2356
01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:58.790
<v Speaker 1>Go to a farm where they're killing a bunch of cows.</v>

2357
01:00:58.850 --> 01:01:01.040
<v Speaker 1>Today's CALC Killam Day go there and say,</v>

2358
01:01:01.041 --> 01:01:01.161
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2359
01:01:01.161 --> 01:01:01.730
<v Speaker 1>let me work there.</v>

2360
01:01:01.730 --> 01:01:02.960
<v Speaker 1>The deliver for a little bit.</v>

2361
01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:03.831
<v Speaker 1>Let me fuck it.</v>

2362
01:01:03.831 --> 01:01:04.970
<v Speaker 1>Put a nail gun in his head.</v>

2363
01:01:05.090 --> 01:01:05.301
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2364
01:01:05.301 --> 01:01:05.691
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

2365
01:01:05.691 --> 01:01:07.070
<v Speaker 1>That's like a semantics argument.</v>

2366
01:01:07.071 --> 01:01:08.090
<v Speaker 1>Like why would you even care?</v>

2367
01:01:08.091 --> 01:01:08.481
<v Speaker 1>You're killing.</v>

2368
01:01:08.481 --> 01:01:09.590
<v Speaker 1>You're taking a life either way.</v>

2369
01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:13.550
<v Speaker 1>Take a life that's destined to be taken and it's less work.</v>

2370
01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:14.211
<v Speaker 1>It's less.</v>

2371
01:01:14.211 --> 01:01:14.721
<v Speaker 1>Less mean.</v>

2372
01:01:14.721 --> 01:01:17.720
<v Speaker 1>If that's a normal kind of meet people eat then that seems like if you're</v>

2373
01:01:17.721 --> 01:01:22.000
<v Speaker 1>sending you wondering where deer is as normal as eating cows,</v>

2374
01:01:22.001 --> 01:01:23.400
<v Speaker 1>well first of all to one,</v>

2375
01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:26.810
<v Speaker 1>people don't eat there as much to if they do where they have it.</v>

2376
01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:29.660
<v Speaker 1>If they do eat meat,</v>

2377
01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:32.910
<v Speaker 1>they usually get it from supermarkets which are farmed today.</v>

2378
01:01:33.450 --> 01:01:35.630
<v Speaker 1>Today we want to take human history.</v>

2379
01:01:35.631 --> 01:01:36.560
<v Speaker 1>People have been eating deer.</v>

2380
01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:38.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you're saying you want to take a part of what you're eating and say</v>

2381
01:01:38.930 --> 01:01:39.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to take uh,</v>

2382
01:01:40.020 --> 01:01:40.400
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2383
01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:43.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to let my conscious sit on this and see this is what we're doing and</v>

2384
01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:48.320
<v Speaker 1>what you want to go and do actually what you're doing to get that meat and not</v>

2385
01:01:48.321 --> 01:01:49.340
<v Speaker 1>change it to a different way.</v>

2386
01:01:49.550 --> 01:01:50.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm not sure I follow you.</v>

2387
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:54.940
<v Speaker 1>If you get your chicken from farms that killed 3000 chickens in a day,</v>

2388
01:01:55.030 --> 01:01:56.210
<v Speaker 1>and that's where people get that chicken.</v>

2389
01:01:57.050 --> 01:01:59.510
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't it be better if you want to see what it's actually like where there's</v>

2390
01:01:59.511 --> 01:02:00.111
<v Speaker 1>checking comes from,</v>

2391
01:02:00.111 --> 01:02:02.570
<v Speaker 1>would it be better to go to a place like that where the count chickens all day</v>

2392
01:02:02.571 --> 01:02:04.310
<v Speaker 1>and have it strong up and sliced his throat,</v>

2393
01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:07.030
<v Speaker 1>then killing a while checking,</v>

2394
01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:08.060
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2395
01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:08.893
<v Speaker 1>without them.</v>

2396
01:02:08.930 --> 01:02:12.680
<v Speaker 1>If you are dead set on eating factory raise chicken,</v>

2397
01:02:12.681 --> 01:02:13.730
<v Speaker 1>I could see your point.</v>

2398
01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.770
<v Speaker 1>But if your point was that you want it to be a part of what you ate that not</v>

2399
01:02:18.771 --> 01:02:20.010
<v Speaker 1>that you specifically wanted</v>

2400
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:22.050
<v Speaker 2>to eat factory raise chicken.</v>

2401
01:02:22.130 --> 01:02:22.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2402
01:02:22.380 --> 01:02:23.041
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2403
01:02:23.041 --> 01:02:28.041
<v Speaker 2>Like I think that the idea of an animal living a wild life and then it's life</v>

2404
01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:30.600
<v Speaker 2>ending in a brief moment because a bullet.</v>

2405
01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:31.320
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2406
01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:34.260
<v Speaker 2>I think that is a more humane and more,</v>

2407
01:02:34.590 --> 01:02:37.100
<v Speaker 2>I don't even like the word humane because humane.</v>

2408
01:02:37.310 --> 01:02:37.650
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

2409
01:02:37.650 --> 01:02:39.540
<v Speaker 2>What is the actual meaning of humane cause?</v>

2410
01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:41.490
<v Speaker 2>Is it because humans,</v>

2411
01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:43.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you're so fucking humane.</v>

2412
01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:47.030
<v Speaker 2>Technically we've,</v>

2413
01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:48.560
<v Speaker 2>if you look at how we acquire,</v>

2414
01:02:48.750 --> 01:02:51.550
<v Speaker 2>that's not all right then we're going to farm.</v>

2415
01:02:51.590 --> 01:02:52.500
<v Speaker 2>They would have died then.</v>

2416
01:02:52.501 --> 01:02:54.420
<v Speaker 2>So it's like you can take apart without adding to the,</v>

2417
01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:54.960
<v Speaker 2>to a kill.</v>

2418
01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:55.741
<v Speaker 2>I see what you're saying,</v>

2419
01:02:55.741 --> 01:02:56.820
<v Speaker 2>but it doesn't make sense.</v>

2420
01:02:57.150 --> 01:02:58.050
<v Speaker 2>I think you're just begged,</v>

2421
01:03:00.210 --> 01:03:01.043
<v Speaker 2>begged,</v>

2422
01:03:01.490 --> 01:03:03.330
<v Speaker 2>but it totally makes sense that I see what you're saying.</v>

2423
01:03:03.331 --> 01:03:05.360
<v Speaker 2>You want to show that you're a part of this and they'll work counseling.</v>

2424
01:03:05.400 --> 01:03:05.811
<v Speaker 2>Most of you know,</v>

2425
01:03:05.811 --> 01:03:06.360
<v Speaker 2>I want it there.</v>

2426
01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:07.680
<v Speaker 2>I also want to eat game.</v>

2427
01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:09.750
<v Speaker 2>I could gain the best food.</v>

2428
01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:10.261
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2429
01:03:10.261 --> 01:03:10.620
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2430
01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:10.771
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

2431
01:03:10.771 --> 01:03:15.210
<v Speaker 2>I've said this for a long time that I think that there's probably more nutrition</v>

2432
01:03:15.211 --> 01:03:17.280
<v Speaker 2>and wild game than any other kind of food.</v>

2433
01:03:17.281 --> 01:03:20.460
<v Speaker 2>And I think that that's one of the reasons why they're so elusive.</v>

2434
01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:23.860
<v Speaker 2>They know that they're worth something dear.</v>

2435
01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:27.240
<v Speaker 2>When the deer hears you and those fucking intendant ears pop up and they start</v>

2436
01:03:27.241 --> 01:03:27.690
<v Speaker 2>looking at,</v>

2437
01:03:27.690 --> 01:03:31.320
<v Speaker 2>they know that they're like super nutritious and there's a bunch of animals out</v>

2438
01:03:31.321 --> 01:03:32.880
<v Speaker 2>there that are just trying to jack them.</v>

2439
01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:35.610
<v Speaker 2>They used to be a lot more mountain lions,</v>

2440
01:03:35.611 --> 01:03:37.650
<v Speaker 2>but apparently they have a good healthy supply of them.</v>

2441
01:03:37.651 --> 01:03:38.130
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

2442
01:03:38.130 --> 01:03:39.900
<v Speaker 2>We didn't see any while we were there,</v>

2443
01:03:40.110 --> 01:03:41.700
<v Speaker 2>but whenever you have a lot of deer,</v>

2444
01:03:41.701 --> 01:03:44.830
<v Speaker 2>you have a lot of mountain lions because that's where the three,</v>

2445
01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:45.271
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2446
01:03:45.271 --> 01:03:46.110
<v Speaker 2>that's what they eat.</v>

2447
01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:47.370
<v Speaker 2>Especially Fonz.</v>

2448
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:50.560
<v Speaker 2>They'll go after the babies because they're easy and they could take them and</v>

2449
01:03:50.590 --> 01:03:53.100
<v Speaker 2>that kind of made sure to set everything up work because everything sort of a</v>

2450
01:03:53.101 --> 01:03:53.934
<v Speaker 2>fighting chance.</v>

2451
01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:55.320
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to kill you,</v>

2452
01:03:55.321 --> 01:03:57.690
<v Speaker 2>but the ones that are too bold and go out away from the herd,</v>

2453
01:03:57.720 --> 01:03:58.553
<v Speaker 2>you're going to get jack.</v>

2454
01:03:58.950 --> 01:04:00.600
<v Speaker 2>It's very fascinating to be,</v>

2455
01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:05.640
<v Speaker 2>even though I went there with all these human inventions like tents and guns and</v>

2456
01:04:05.671 --> 01:04:06.181
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff,</v>

2457
01:04:06.181 --> 01:04:10.350
<v Speaker 2>to be out there living in nature for four or five days,</v>

2458
01:04:10.351 --> 01:04:12.900
<v Speaker 2>it's so far very eyeopening experience,</v>

2459
01:04:12.901 --> 01:04:13.734
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2460
01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:14.573
<v Speaker 2>There's some weird,</v>

2461
01:04:14.790 --> 01:04:18.840
<v Speaker 2>some weird primal shit goes off when you're out there stalking a deer that</v>

2462
01:04:18.841 --> 01:04:19.920
<v Speaker 2>you're eventually going to eat.</v>

2463
01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:22.800
<v Speaker 2>And then like later that night you're sitting in front of a campfire with a</v>

2464
01:04:22.801 --> 01:04:27.801
<v Speaker 2>bunch of men and everyone's feasting on the meat from this animal and talking</v>

2465
01:04:27.841 --> 01:04:30.150
<v Speaker 2>about how delicious it is and enjoying it.</v>

2466
01:04:30.170 --> 01:04:32.160
<v Speaker 2>And it's very strange,</v>

2467
01:04:32.161 --> 01:04:32.431
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2468
01:04:32.431 --> 01:04:32.690
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

2469
01:04:32.690 --> 01:04:32.910
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2470
01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:33.740
<v Speaker 2>it's a lot.</v>

2471
01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:36.690
<v Speaker 2>I can see where a lot of people would be uncomfortable with it.</v>

2472
01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:39.840
<v Speaker 2>I could see where a lot of people would be angry and you know,</v>

2473
01:04:39.841 --> 01:04:43.440
<v Speaker 2>they might be a little bit of rational and be pissed at me that I went and w and</v>

2474
01:04:43.441 --> 01:04:44.250
<v Speaker 2>I hunted.</v>

2475
01:04:44.250 --> 01:04:44.821
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

2476
01:04:44.821 --> 01:04:45.181
<v Speaker 2>you're not,</v>

2477
01:04:45.181 --> 01:04:46.980
<v Speaker 2>you're not mad at me when I have a cheeseburger,</v>

2478
01:04:47.130 --> 01:04:47.431
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2479
01:04:47.431 --> 01:04:47.821
<v Speaker 2>there's not,</v>

2480
01:04:47.821 --> 01:04:52.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't get cries for an anger when I put a steak on the grill and take a photo</v>

2481
01:04:52.351 --> 01:04:52.770
<v Speaker 2>of it,</v>

2482
01:04:52.770 --> 01:04:55.770
<v Speaker 2>which I do all the time because I like to cook steaks like two o'clock in the</v>

2483
01:04:55.771 --> 01:04:57.720
<v Speaker 2>morning like a boss.</v>

2484
01:04:57.870 --> 01:04:59.490
<v Speaker 2>What happens if you didn't find that dude that day?</v>

2485
01:04:59.990 --> 01:05:00.780
<v Speaker 2>We have no idea.</v>

2486
01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:01.613
<v Speaker 2>I got to keep looking.</v>

2487
01:05:01.710 --> 01:05:01.951
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2488
01:05:01.951 --> 01:05:03.210
<v Speaker 2>we ate this fridge,</v>

2489
01:05:03.330 --> 01:05:04.980
<v Speaker 2>freeze dried foods.</v>

2490
01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:07.140
<v Speaker 2>We ate these freeze dried meals.</v>

2491
01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:10.590
<v Speaker 2>The like you opened them up and you pour hot water on them and they had these</v>

2492
01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:11.370
<v Speaker 2>jets,</v>

2493
01:05:11.370 --> 01:05:15.960
<v Speaker 2>these flame jets that would boil water and you turn the flame jets on and you</v>

2494
01:05:15.961 --> 01:05:20.080
<v Speaker 2>put this water canister over and it'll boil the water and the water starts</v>

2495
01:05:20.081 --> 01:05:21.120
<v Speaker 2>boiling and you shut it off.</v>

2496
01:05:21.121 --> 01:05:24.460
<v Speaker 2>And then you pour the boiling water into the bag and you seal it and you let it</v>

2497
01:05:24.461 --> 01:05:26.350
<v Speaker 2>sit for a few minutes and it's not bad.</v>

2498
01:05:26.351 --> 01:05:26.561
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2499
01:05:26.561 --> 01:05:27.300
<v Speaker 2>they have like,</v>

2500
01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:28.490
<v Speaker 2>like you're boil the water over.</v>

2501
01:05:28.491 --> 01:05:30.640
<v Speaker 2>Cause he saw that shit on Amazon,</v>

2502
01:05:30.641 --> 01:05:33.400
<v Speaker 2>like a huge carton of just tons of those packs,</v>

2503
01:05:33.590 --> 01:05:34.600
<v Speaker 2>the right stuff.</v>

2504
01:05:34.601 --> 01:05:34.751
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2505
01:05:34.751 --> 01:05:35.810
<v Speaker 2>like if we go,</v>

2506
01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:37.073
<v Speaker 2>we need that.</v>

2507
01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:38.620
<v Speaker 2>You'd be amazed at like,</v>

2508
01:05:38.621 --> 01:05:40.240
<v Speaker 2>you could actually survive off of it.</v>

2509
01:05:40.241 --> 01:05:40.960
<v Speaker 2>It's not bad.</v>

2510
01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:42.160
<v Speaker 2>It actually tastes pretty good.</v>

2511
01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:43.353
<v Speaker 2>So you see,</v>

2512
01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:46.600
<v Speaker 2>the only thing that was was ruthless is the sleeping outside.</v>

2513
01:05:46.870 --> 01:05:47.380
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>

2514
01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:49.300
<v Speaker 2>that's really difficult to get used to.</v>

2515
01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:50.530
<v Speaker 2>And the,</v>

2516
01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:50.721
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2517
01:05:50.721 --> 01:05:54.490
<v Speaker 2>the physical activity of stocking the animal and then the reality of the</v>

2518
01:05:54.491 --> 01:05:55.720
<v Speaker 2>shooting of the animal,</v>

2519
01:05:56.040 --> 01:06:00.310
<v Speaker 2>that that was intense because I wondered how it was gonna feel about that.</v>

2520
01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:03.100
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if I was going to feel sad if I'm going to feel bad,</v>

2521
01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:04.870
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't feel bad.</v>

2522
01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:05.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2523
01:06:05.381 --> 01:06:07.270
<v Speaker 2>When I felt it felt very natural.</v>

2524
01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:08.021
<v Speaker 2>And when you're eating it,</v>

2525
01:06:08.021 --> 01:06:09.070
<v Speaker 2>when you're thinking about the animal,</v>

2526
01:06:09.071 --> 01:06:09.461
<v Speaker 2>you're killed.</v>

2527
01:06:09.461 --> 01:06:09.731
<v Speaker 2>It really,</v>

2528
01:06:09.731 --> 01:06:10.630
<v Speaker 2>we're just enjoying a good,</v>

2529
01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:11.200
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

2530
01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.280
<v Speaker 2>I was enjoying it.</v>

2531
01:06:12.281 --> 01:06:14.830
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about the process in which,</v>

2532
01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:15.580
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2533
01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:15.941
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2534
01:06:15.941 --> 01:06:16.571
<v Speaker 2>it happened.</v>

2535
01:06:16.571 --> 01:06:17.980
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking about it's life.</v>

2536
01:06:18.010 --> 01:06:18.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2537
01:06:18.450 --> 01:06:18.680
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2538
01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:19.481
<v Speaker 2>I felt,</v>

2539
01:06:19.481 --> 01:06:20.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2540
01:06:20.020 --> 01:06:24.070
<v Speaker 2>I mean it sounds very cliche to say you feel very connected with nature,</v>

2541
01:06:24.430 --> 01:06:25.090
<v Speaker 2>but man,</v>

2542
01:06:25.090 --> 01:06:26.620
<v Speaker 2>that is the perfect description.</v>

2543
01:06:26.621 --> 01:06:28.300
<v Speaker 2>It's like being connected with nature,</v>

2544
01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:29.051
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2545
01:06:29.051 --> 01:06:29.351
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>

2546
01:06:29.351 --> 01:06:32.170
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to eat nature to be connected with it.</v>

2547
01:06:32.890 --> 01:06:33.341
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

2548
01:06:33.341 --> 01:06:34.031
<v Speaker 2>but guess what,</v>

2549
01:06:34.031 --> 01:06:34.670
<v Speaker 2>folks,</v>

2550
01:06:34.670 --> 01:06:36.250
<v Speaker 2>when we eat Broccoli,</v>

2551
01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:36.551
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

2552
01:06:36.551 --> 01:06:37.540
<v Speaker 2>you're eating nature.</v>

2553
01:06:37.541 --> 01:06:38.140
<v Speaker 2>You're fuck,</v>

2554
01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:38.830
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2555
01:06:38.830 --> 01:06:39.760
<v Speaker 2>When you eat celery,</v>

2556
01:06:39.761 --> 01:06:40.594
<v Speaker 2>you're eating nature.</v>

2557
01:06:40.900 --> 01:06:41.141
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2558
01:06:41.141 --> 01:06:42.070
<v Speaker 2>when you eat beets,</v>

2559
01:06:42.071 --> 01:06:44.170
<v Speaker 2>you're eating a living part of nature.</v>

2560
01:06:44.171 --> 01:06:44.890
<v Speaker 2>It's just can't,</v>

2561
01:06:44.890 --> 01:06:45.940
<v Speaker 2>it can't defend itself.</v>

2562
01:06:45.941 --> 01:06:46.900
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't scream,</v>

2563
01:06:47.150 --> 01:06:48.370
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't try to run away.</v>

2564
01:06:48.580 --> 01:06:49.690
<v Speaker 2>So you assume it's okay.</v>

2565
01:06:49.930 --> 01:06:51.610
<v Speaker 2>It's not the same species as us.</v>

2566
01:06:51.730 --> 01:06:54.070
<v Speaker 2>But we would be super excited if we found that on Mars.</v>

2567
01:06:54.250 --> 01:06:54.521
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2568
01:06:54.521 --> 01:06:56.890
<v Speaker 2>If we found Kale on Mars and you know,</v>

2569
01:06:56.891 --> 01:06:58.540
<v Speaker 2>and in some asshole came around and ate it,</v>

2570
01:07:00.990 --> 01:07:01.691
<v Speaker 2>fucking Mars,</v>

2571
01:07:01.691 --> 01:07:01.931
<v Speaker 2>Kale,</v>

2572
01:07:01.931 --> 01:07:02.764
<v Speaker 2>you can't,</v>

2573
01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:04.960
<v Speaker 2>this is life from another planet and you ate it.</v>

2574
01:07:04.961 --> 01:07:05.830
<v Speaker 2>It's Mars Fed.</v>

2575
01:07:05.950 --> 01:07:07.180
<v Speaker 2>It gets so regular though.</v>

2576
01:07:07.270 --> 01:07:07.460
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

2577
01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:10.420
<v Speaker 2>and it doesn't mean that I didn't think that the animal was beautiful.</v>

2578
01:07:10.421 --> 01:07:11.710
<v Speaker 2>I thought the animals very beautiful.</v>

2579
01:07:11.711 --> 01:07:12.970
<v Speaker 2>I'm amazed just to see them.</v>

2580
01:07:12.971 --> 01:07:15.730
<v Speaker 2>I enjoyed seeing all the rams that we couldn't shoot.</v>

2581
01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:16.960
<v Speaker 2>We couldn't get tagged to shoot them,</v>

2582
01:07:16.961 --> 01:07:17.920
<v Speaker 2>but I enjoyed seeing them.</v>

2583
01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:22.690
<v Speaker 2>But I think that ideally I would like to eat nothing but game meat.</v>

2584
01:07:23.110 --> 01:07:24.910
<v Speaker 2>I think that'd be the best for me,</v>

2585
01:07:25.090 --> 01:07:26.110
<v Speaker 2>like health wise.</v>

2586
01:07:26.470 --> 01:07:30.580
<v Speaker 2>And I think that it would be the most honest way to be a mediator and the,</v>

2587
01:07:30.581 --> 01:07:31.720
<v Speaker 2>so that's what I'm going to try to do.</v>

2588
01:07:31.721 --> 01:07:34.420
<v Speaker 2>And we're going to go again in the summer and we'd go hunting for Caribou.</v>

2589
01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:35.830
<v Speaker 2>Carolyn's going to go again,</v>

2590
01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:36.701
<v Speaker 2>eat those things.</v>

2591
01:07:36.701 --> 01:07:36.911
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2592
01:07:36.911 --> 01:07:37.744
<v Speaker 2>they're huge.</v>

2593
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:39.700
<v Speaker 2>And so you're going to have stuff shipped in from now on?</v>

2594
01:07:39.790 --> 01:07:40.151
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2595
01:07:40.151 --> 01:07:40.620
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

2596
01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:41.770
<v Speaker 2>my meat is in,</v>

2597
01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:42.220
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2598
01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:43.090
<v Speaker 2>is in Montana.</v>

2599
01:07:43.091 --> 01:07:43.924
<v Speaker 2>It's on its way to me.</v>

2600
01:07:44.050 --> 01:07:45.400
<v Speaker 2>They freeze it and they send it.</v>

2601
01:07:45.610 --> 01:07:45.881
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2602
01:07:45.881 --> 01:07:46.440
<v Speaker 2>I mean it.</v>

2603
01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:50.050
<v Speaker 2>What's your like from like more often I'm going to do this more often.</v>

2604
01:07:50.230 --> 01:07:50.531
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2605
01:07:50.531 --> 01:07:50.831
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to do,</v>

2606
01:07:50.831 --> 01:07:52.420
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to try to go hunting a couple times a year.</v>

2607
01:07:52.450 --> 01:07:53.800
<v Speaker 2>Can you just buy game meat?</v>

2608
01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:54.401
<v Speaker 2>You could,</v>

2609
01:07:54.401 --> 01:07:55.234
<v Speaker 2>you could do that too,</v>

2610
01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:55.601
<v Speaker 2>but you,</v>

2611
01:07:55.601 --> 01:07:57.190
<v Speaker 2>what you'd be buying is the animals,</v>

2612
01:07:57.191 --> 01:08:00.700
<v Speaker 2>but they'd be like in a farm situation and you'd have to make sure that they</v>

2613
01:08:00.701 --> 01:08:01.540
<v Speaker 2>were grass fed.</v>

2614
01:08:01.570 --> 01:08:03.480
<v Speaker 2>You would want to make sure I don't have a wild game that you can,</v>

2615
01:08:03.560 --> 01:08:04.340
<v Speaker 2>you can buy.</v>

2616
01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:04.641
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2617
01:08:04.641 --> 01:08:04.940
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2618
01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:06.550
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you're allowed to sell wild game.</v>

2619
01:08:06.730 --> 01:08:06.971
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2620
01:08:06.971 --> 01:08:07.341
<v Speaker 2>real.</v>

2621
01:08:07.341 --> 01:08:07.511
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2622
01:08:07.511 --> 01:08:08.321
<v Speaker 2>I think you have to,</v>

2623
01:08:08.321 --> 01:08:09.580
<v Speaker 2>it has to be domesticated.</v>

2624
01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:11.680
<v Speaker 2>I think I could be wrong about that.</v>

2625
01:08:11.710 --> 01:08:13.540
<v Speaker 2>It might be different in each state as well.</v>

2626
01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:14.970
<v Speaker 2>There's a very big,</v>

2627
01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:15.591
<v Speaker 2>any difference.</v>

2628
01:08:15.591 --> 01:08:16.040
<v Speaker 2>I know</v>

2629
01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:18.350
<v Speaker 1>a fresh water fish,</v>

2630
01:08:18.351 --> 01:08:21.050
<v Speaker 1>I think tastes better the quicker you get it to the pan.</v>

2631
01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:21.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2632
01:08:21.710 --> 01:08:22.521
<v Speaker 1>but I'm salt water,</v>

2633
01:08:22.521 --> 01:08:25.820
<v Speaker 1>not as much of a problem is or does it any freshness factor to it?</v>

2634
01:08:25.821 --> 01:08:26.150
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

2635
01:08:26.150 --> 01:08:26.331
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2636
01:08:26.331 --> 01:08:26.931
<v Speaker 1>the Oregon's,</v>

2637
01:08:26.931 --> 01:08:27.380
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

2638
01:08:27.380 --> 01:08:29.600
<v Speaker 1>You should cook the Oregons quickly as possible.</v>

2639
01:08:29.601 --> 01:08:32.420
<v Speaker 1>The organs and delicious like dear liver is fantastic.</v>

2640
01:08:32.421 --> 01:08:33.300
<v Speaker 1>He's better right then.</v>

2641
01:08:33.301 --> 01:08:34.370
<v Speaker 1>Then a day later,</v>

2642
01:08:34.390 --> 01:08:34.501
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2643
01:08:34.501 --> 01:08:35.001
<v Speaker 1>you don't want it,</v>

2644
01:08:35.001 --> 01:08:35.381
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>

2645
01:08:35.381 --> 01:08:36.750
<v Speaker 1>the meat actually is a,</v>

2646
01:08:36.810 --> 01:08:37.381
<v Speaker 1>according to Steve.</v>

2647
01:08:37.381 --> 01:08:38.660
<v Speaker 1>Grinnell is better the next day.</v>

2648
01:08:38.870 --> 01:08:41.210
<v Speaker 1>It gives you the chance to relax and uh,</v>

2649
01:08:41.211 --> 01:08:41.421
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2650
01:08:41.421 --> 01:08:41.610
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2651
01:08:41.610 --> 01:08:42.443
<v Speaker 1>it's a very,</v>

2652
01:08:42.450 --> 01:08:44.540
<v Speaker 1>you muscular animal,</v>

2653
01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:45.990
<v Speaker 1>so you have to prepare in a certain,</v>

2654
01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:47.200
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2655
01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:48.140
<v Speaker 1>it's very little fat.</v>

2656
01:08:48.170 --> 01:08:49.100
<v Speaker 1>They're incredibly lean.</v>

2657
01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:50.360
<v Speaker 1>So when you cook them,</v>

2658
01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:52.670
<v Speaker 1>you have to make sure that you don't over cook it.</v>

2659
01:08:52.671 --> 01:08:54.620
<v Speaker 1>You Cook it really quickly and uh,</v>

2660
01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:59.360
<v Speaker 1>either you have it very much on the rare side you can really venison venison.</v>

2661
01:08:59.420 --> 01:08:59.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2662
01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:01.280
<v Speaker 1>Or You could slow cook it.</v>

2663
01:09:01.281 --> 01:09:01.941
<v Speaker 1>That's the other way too,</v>

2664
01:09:01.941 --> 01:09:03.740
<v Speaker 1>where it breaks it down like a pork shoulder.</v>

2665
01:09:03.741 --> 01:09:04.010
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2666
01:09:04.010 --> 01:09:04.461
<v Speaker 1>they do that,</v>

2667
01:09:04.461 --> 01:09:05.300
<v Speaker 1>they slow cook it.</v>

2668
01:09:06.110 --> 01:09:06.351
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2669
01:09:06.351 --> 01:09:07.700
<v Speaker 1>so we'll wind up,</v>

2670
01:09:07.730 --> 01:09:08.563
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2671
01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:10.310
<v Speaker 1>I'll figure out,</v>

2672
01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:11.330
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2673
01:09:11.330 --> 01:09:11.780
<v Speaker 1>how to,</v>

2674
01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:12.650
<v Speaker 1>how to cook all of it.</v>

2675
01:09:13.190 --> 01:09:14.023
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

2676

2678
01:09:15.470 --> 01:09:17.660
<v Speaker 1>that's probably like 60 or 70,000 pounds of meat.</v>

2679
01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:20.280
<v Speaker 1>We rename you think all our meats.</v>

2680
01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:21.170

2681
01:09:21.171 --> 01:09:22.500
<v Speaker 1>but all our meats we renamed.</v>

2682
01:09:22.650 --> 01:09:24.380
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to talk about the animal that it is.</v>

2683
01:09:24.470 --> 01:09:27.440
<v Speaker 1>Probably like venison and yeah.</v>

2723
01:10:13.110 --> 01:10:14.870
<v Speaker 1>It's celebrity bull riding and I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you're out of your mind.</v>

2726
01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:18.050
<v Speaker 1>I think Stephen Baldwin did it in a couple of other people.</v>

01:10:18.051 --> 01:10:18.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2729
01:10:18.750 --> 01:10:21.080
<v Speaker 1>it's asking for your body to be broken forever.</v>

2730
01:10:21.980 --> 01:10:25.280
<v Speaker 1>Not even getting stomped on just the throne from a bull dude.</v>

2731
01:10:25.370 --> 01:10:25.700
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2732
01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:27.680
<v Speaker 1>nobody rides a bull successfully.</v>

2733
01:10:27.950 --> 01:10:30.380
<v Speaker 1>It's just a matter of how long before you get thrown off.</v>

2734
01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:31.191
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>

2735
01:10:31.191 --> 01:10:31.820
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2736
01:10:31.820 --> 01:10:32.151
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>

2737
01:10:32.151 --> 01:10:33.080
<v Speaker 1>that's what you have to deal with.</v>

2738
01:10:33.090 --> 01:10:33.591
<v Speaker 1>It's the best thing.</v>

2739
01:10:33.591 --> 01:10:35.380
<v Speaker 1>You write it out so it runs out of energy.</v>

2740
01:10:35.390 --> 01:10:37.310
<v Speaker 1>Then you just write a so stupid on it.</v>

2741
01:10:37.730 --> 01:10:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Riding a boast.</v>

2742
01:10:38.581 --> 01:10:39.440
<v Speaker 1>So ridiculous.</v>

2743
01:10:39.441 --> 01:10:39.701

2747
01:10:41.841 --> 01:10:42.980
<v Speaker 1>you're frying it up or whatever.</v>

2748
01:10:43.010 --> 01:10:43.480
<v Speaker 1>Strange.</v>

2749
01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:43.640
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2750
01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:47.210
<v Speaker 1>but like the feeling of being able to talk fully for the first time.</v>

2751
01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:48.411
<v Speaker 1>Could you,</v>

2752

2759
01:10:56.540 --> 01:10:59.330

2807
01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:22.680
<v Speaker 2>the same way they would back then where they would make like a boat out of these</v>

2808
01:12:22.681 --> 01:12:23.270
<v Speaker 2>things and,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I really enjoyed it.</v>

2814
01:12:29.251 --> 01:12:32.430
<v Speaker 2>He's like a real wild west historian.</v>

2815
01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:36.810
<v Speaker 2>Like he told us some crazy fucking stories about different things at the Indians</v>

2816
01:12:36.811 --> 01:12:37.920
<v Speaker 2>had done to the white man.</v>

2817
01:12:37.921 --> 01:12:39.360
<v Speaker 2>The white man had done to the Indians.</v>

2818
01:12:39.361 --> 01:12:40.800
<v Speaker 2>And one dude,</v>

2819
01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:41.610
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2820
01:12:41.610 --> 01:12:42.030
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

2821
01:12:42.030 --> 01:12:42.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2822
01:12:42.330 --> 01:12:42.750
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2823
01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:43.201
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2824
01:12:43.201 --> 01:12:43.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2825
01:12:43.440 --> 01:12:44.071
<v Speaker 2>he gave up,</v>

2826
01:12:44.071 --> 01:12:45.510
<v Speaker 2>but his friend tried to resist,</v>

2827
01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:46.740
<v Speaker 2>so they took his friend,</v>

2828
01:12:46.741 --> 01:12:49.110
<v Speaker 2>they butchered him in front of them and cut them open.</v>

2829
01:12:49.840 --> 01:12:50.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2830
01:12:50.100 --> 01:12:53.640
<v Speaker 2>They cut his dick off and they rubbed it all over his friend cut his lungs off,</v>

2831
01:12:53.641 --> 01:12:54.474
<v Speaker 2>rubbed all his friends,</v>

2832
01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:55.261
<v Speaker 2>and then they told them,</v>

2833
01:12:55.261 --> 01:12:57.210
<v Speaker 2>we're going to give you a headstart and then we're going to come and kill you.</v>

2834
01:12:57.420 --> 01:12:59.070
<v Speaker 2>And so this guy out random,</v>

2835
01:12:59.190 --> 01:13:02.310
<v Speaker 2>and he outran them and jumped into the river and hid in a beaver den.</v>

2836
01:13:02.440 --> 01:13:03.870
<v Speaker 2>They have beaver dens everywhere.</v>

2837
01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:05.010
<v Speaker 2>And the beaver dens.</v>

2838
01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:08.940
<v Speaker 2>What it is essentially is it's like the water's running there and this guy</v>

2839
01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:13.740
<v Speaker 2>climbed under the water and into a hole that the beavers had dug into the side</v>

2840
01:13:13.741 --> 01:13:15.910
<v Speaker 2>of the river bank so they can eat,</v>

2841
01:13:16.170 --> 01:13:17.003
<v Speaker 2>breathe in there.</v>

2842
01:13:17.100 --> 01:13:20.820
<v Speaker 2>So he laid in there and waited until the Indians left.</v>

2843
01:13:21.030 --> 01:13:25.770
<v Speaker 2>And then he walked a hundred miles down to the nearest town and barefoot and</v>

2844
01:13:25.771 --> 01:13:26.490
<v Speaker 2>naked.</v>

2845
01:13:26.490 --> 01:13:27.180
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

2846
01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:31.560
<v Speaker 2>he ate a rattlesnake and he ate a piece of just raw.</v>

2847
01:13:31.620 --> 01:13:32.190
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

2848
01:13:32.190 --> 01:13:35.250
<v Speaker 2>And a piece of buffalo that he found as he was,</v>

2849
01:13:35.290 --> 01:13:37.710
<v Speaker 2>uh Oh wait,</v>

2850
01:13:37.711 --> 01:13:41.490
<v Speaker 2>so the Indians killed his friend in front of this group just to be more like me</v>

2851

2857
01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:51.653
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

2858
01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:53.130
<v Speaker 2>You know what's also fascinating,</v>

2859
01:13:53.131 --> 01:13:54.310
<v Speaker 2>what he told me it was him,</v>

2860
01:13:54.510 --> 01:13:57.820
<v Speaker 2>how ruthless the Indians were to each other or the native Americans,</v>

2861
01:13:57.821 --> 01:13:58.950
<v Speaker 2>you should say each other.</v>

2862
01:13:59.190 --> 01:14:01.620
<v Speaker 2>Like they were fucking checking each other left and right.</v>

2863
01:14:01.621 --> 01:14:02.280
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

2864
01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:03.450
<v Speaker 2>there was some that were near the,</v>

2865
01:14:03.451 --> 01:14:06.450
<v Speaker 2>in the Great Lakes area that we're practicing cannibalism of.</v>

2866
01:14:06.451 --> 01:14:08.640
<v Speaker 2>Other tribes are on a regular basis.</v>

2867
01:14:08.920 --> 01:14:10.140
<v Speaker 2>They were eating them for food.</v>

2868

<v Speaker 2>I mean it was like,</v>

2870
01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:16.360
<v Speaker 2>imagine how harsh it must've been around the great lakes like in the winter,</v>

<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

2873
01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:22.440
<v Speaker 2>I guess some of the natives that were were hearing each other,</v>

2874
01:14:22.450 --> 01:14:26.530
<v Speaker 2>we're ruthless and they actually want up cannibalizing people.</v>

01:17:50.531 --> 01:17:51.131
<v Speaker 3>it's so,</v>

3000
01:17:51.131 --> 01:17:51.341
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>

3001
01:17:51.341 --> 01:17:52.990
<v Speaker 3>so a lot of that before</v>

3002
01:17:54.450 --> 01:17:55.370
<v Speaker 2>moment is so,</v>

3003
01:17:55.371 --> 01:17:55.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3004
01:17:55.680 --> 01:17:57.390
<v Speaker 2>like it's so sober.</v>

3005
01:17:57.810 --> 01:18:00.610
<v Speaker 2>You know the one moment you just shot an animal for the first time and he</v>

3006
01:18:00.611 --> 01:18:04.650
<v Speaker 2>dropped it and seen it flop onto its back with its legs up in the air and it was</v>

3007
01:18:04.651 --> 01:18:05.311
<v Speaker 2>like trying to get up,</v>

3008
01:18:05.311 --> 01:18:06.144
<v Speaker 2>but he couldn't get up.</v>

3009
01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:07.193
<v Speaker 2>It was done.</v>

3010
01:18:07.320 --> 01:18:08.160
<v Speaker 2>You didn't think to say,</v>

3011
01:18:08.460 --> 01:18:10.140
<v Speaker 2>I guess the buck stops here.</v>

3012
01:18:14.050 --> 01:18:16.870
<v Speaker 3>What does the dude's name dude from Miami?</v>

3013
01:18:16.871 --> 01:18:17.704
<v Speaker 3>CSI.</v>

3014
01:18:17.970 --> 01:18:18.880
<v Speaker 3>What's that sound?</v>

3015
01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:23.140
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>

3016
01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:24.910
<v Speaker 3>I guess the buck stops here.</v>

3017
01:18:24.911 --> 01:18:25.870
<v Speaker 3>You son of a bitch.</v>

3018
01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:27.150
<v Speaker 3>How did</v>

3019
01:18:30.570 --> 01:18:30.961
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't,</v>

3020
01:18:30.961 --> 01:18:32.010
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't funny at all.</v>

3021
01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:33.780
<v Speaker 2>Why did you decide who gets the shot?</v>

3022
01:18:34.170 --> 01:18:34.740
<v Speaker 2>It was me.</v>

3023
01:18:34.740 --> 01:18:35.430
<v Speaker 2>I was,</v>

3024
01:18:35.430 --> 01:18:36.310
<v Speaker 2>I had,</v>

3025
01:18:36.330 --> 01:18:36.780
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3026
01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:41.160
<v Speaker 2>the show I was with about and Brian Cowen was off with a,</v>

3027
01:18:41.190 --> 01:18:41.731
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>

3028
01:18:41.731 --> 01:18:41.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3029
01:18:41.910 --> 01:18:43.110
<v Speaker 2>professional hunting guide.</v>

3030
01:18:43.111 --> 01:18:46.920
<v Speaker 2>And Brian also was getting filmed with a different camera because you can't have</v>

3031
01:18:46.921 --> 01:18:49.020
<v Speaker 2>that many people out hunting.</v>

3032
01:18:49.140 --> 01:18:51.090
<v Speaker 2>Deciding which animal did his go well,</v>

3033
01:18:51.110 --> 01:18:51.261
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3034
01:18:51.261 --> 01:18:51.481
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

3035
01:18:51.481 --> 01:18:51.850
<v Speaker 2>He got,</v>

3036
01:18:51.850 --> 01:18:53.430
<v Speaker 2>he shot an animal to meet up at night.</v>

3037
01:18:53.670 --> 01:18:54.060
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3038
01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:54.241
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3039
01:18:54.241 --> 01:18:55.074
<v Speaker 2>We made up at night.</v>

3040
01:18:55.470 --> 01:18:56.450
<v Speaker 2>You knew of the a plots?</v>

3041
01:18:56.700 --> 01:18:57.030
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3042
01:18:57.030 --> 01:18:57.930
<v Speaker 2>we met up what?</v>

3043
01:18:57.931 --> 01:19:01.110
<v Speaker 2>We had a camping spot and then we would go hiking and they would come back to</v>

3044
01:19:01.111 --> 01:19:03.090
<v Speaker 2>the camp spot and then we would row together.</v>

3045
01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:06.360
<v Speaker 2>So we would talk shit while we're rowing down the river together and make jokes.</v>

3046
01:19:06.361 --> 01:19:10.770
<v Speaker 2>Like Brian Callan is one of the perfect human vans to go on any long trip like</v>

3047
01:19:10.771 --> 01:19:11.310
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

3048
01:19:11.310 --> 01:19:14.910
<v Speaker 2>Cause he's so fucking hilarious and he's never off.</v>

3049
01:19:15.150 --> 01:19:15.811
<v Speaker 2>He's never off.</v>

3050
01:19:15.811 --> 01:19:17.010
<v Speaker 2>He's on the whole time.</v>

3051
01:19:17.030 --> 01:19:21.840
<v Speaker 2>And it was a series of gay jokes that never ended or evolve,</v>

3052
01:19:21.841 --> 01:19:22.230
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>

3053
01:19:22.230 --> 01:19:22.460
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

3054
01:19:22.460 --> 01:19:25.560
<v Speaker 2>they got more and more hilarious until the end of it.</v>

3055
01:19:25.590 --> 01:19:26.400
<v Speaker 2>It was sick.</v>

3056
01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:26.910
<v Speaker 2>While we're,</v>

3057
01:19:26.910 --> 01:19:28.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean this sounds like so disrespectful,</v>

3058
01:19:28.561 --> 01:19:33.420
<v Speaker 2>but while we're like butchering the deer in between it Kaolin</v>

3059
01:19:33.540 --> 01:19:34.210
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3060
01:19:34.210 --> 01:19:36.780
<v Speaker 3>does this thing where he starts,</v>

3061
01:19:37.110 --> 01:19:41.850
<v Speaker 3>stands over the ravine and starts masturbating into the ravine.</v>

3062
01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:42.570
<v Speaker 3>Just,</v>

3063
01:19:42.570 --> 01:19:43.700
<v Speaker 3>just comes up with it.</v>

3064
01:19:43.890 --> 01:19:45.420
<v Speaker 3>They call me the ravine comer.</v>

3065
01:19:45.421 --> 01:19:46.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3066
01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:46.741
<v Speaker 3>That's what I do.</v>

3067
01:19:46.741 --> 01:19:47.640
<v Speaker 3>I find a ravine all,</v>

3068
01:19:47.641 --> 01:19:48.510
<v Speaker 3>I can't help calming.</v>

3069
01:19:48.660 --> 01:19:51.360
<v Speaker 3>I'm coming into the world doing this.</v>

3070
01:19:51.361 --> 01:19:51.781
<v Speaker 3>It was just,</v>

3071
01:19:51.781 --> 01:19:52.890
<v Speaker 3>it was so ridiculous.</v>

3072
01:19:52.891 --> 01:19:54.250
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't have to be able to use that down.</v>

3073
01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:56.610
<v Speaker 3>We're going to put it on the Internet.</v>

3074
01:19:56.820 --> 01:19:58.800
<v Speaker 3>We're going to put it on the Internet because it was so ridiculous.</v>

3075
01:19:58.801 --> 01:19:59.640
<v Speaker 3>It has to go on the Internet.</v>

3076
01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:03.450
<v Speaker 3>He had his tongue out and he was like making this fucking like really aggressive</v>

3077
01:20:03.451 --> 01:20:04.290
<v Speaker 3>face and just shoot</v>

3078
01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:06.260
<v Speaker 2>pretending to shoot loads over the ravine.</v>

3079
01:20:06.261 --> 01:20:07.094
<v Speaker 2>It was so,</v>

3080
01:20:07.260 --> 01:20:09.300
<v Speaker 2>it was so silly and so hilarious.</v>

3081
01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:09.780
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

3082
01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:12.900
<v Speaker 2>but it was also in stark contrast to what we're doing at the time,</v>

3083
01:20:12.901 --> 01:20:14.460
<v Speaker 2>which was butchering this animal.</v>

3084
01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:15.480
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

3085
01:20:15.480 --> 01:20:16.410
<v Speaker 2>When I gutted it,</v>

3086
01:20:16.411 --> 01:20:16.800
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

3087
01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:19.980
<v Speaker 2>that was the really intense part because it was just a few moments after I shot</v>

3088
01:20:19.981 --> 01:20:23.640
<v Speaker 2>it and then all of a sudden I'm cutting it open and as I'm cutting it open steam</v>

3089
01:20:23.641 --> 01:20:24.331
<v Speaker 2>is coming out.</v>

3090
01:20:24.331 --> 01:20:25.080
<v Speaker 2>It's like a Tauntaun.</v>

3091
01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:25.440
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

3092
01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:25.710
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3093
01:20:25.710 --> 01:20:26.700
<v Speaker 2>well not quite so bad,</v>

3094
01:20:26.701 --> 01:20:27.630
<v Speaker 2>but very close and it's,</v>

3095
01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:28.980
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>

3096
01:20:28.981 --> 01:20:29.880
<v Speaker 2>really warm.</v>

3097
01:20:29.881 --> 01:20:30.121
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>

3098
01:20:30.121 --> 01:20:31.680
<v Speaker 2>their bodies are warmer than ours.</v>

3099
01:20:31.830 --> 01:20:34.140
<v Speaker 2>Their bodies like 104 degrees or something like,</v>

3100
01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:35.251
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

3101
01:20:35.251 --> 01:20:36.420
<v Speaker 2>man will not warm him up.</v>

3102
01:20:36.421 --> 01:20:40.440
<v Speaker 2>I had a pull the organs out that they all have you slide to fall out.</v>

3103
01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:40.711
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3104
01:20:40.711 --> 01:20:41.101
<v Speaker 2>You have to,</v>

3105
01:20:41.101 --> 01:20:42.450
<v Speaker 2>you have to slice it a certain way.</v>

3106
01:20:42.450 --> 01:20:46.800
<v Speaker 2>You have to slice around the body and like pull it all the way up to the neck</v>

3107
01:20:46.801 --> 01:20:49.770
<v Speaker 2>and then you have to cut through the rib cage with a hatchet.</v>

3108
01:20:50.420 --> 01:20:50.910
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3109
01:20:50.910 --> 01:20:51.990
<v Speaker 2>It's serious shit,</v>

3110
01:20:51.991 --> 01:20:52.171
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3111
01:20:52.171 --> 01:20:52.891
<v Speaker 2>Is that your first time?</v>

3112
01:20:52.891 --> 01:20:56.760
<v Speaker 2>Like you never did any kind of like butcher snow knows it's fucking serious</v>

3113
01:20:56.761 --> 01:20:57.180
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

3114
01:20:57.180 --> 01:20:57.391
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

3115
01:20:57.391 --> 01:21:01.290
<v Speaker 2>you know when you're eating a piece of meat from an animal that you saw bouncing</v>

3116
01:21:01.291 --> 01:21:06.291
<v Speaker 2>around and then you put a bullet into him and then you go and open them up and</v>

3117
01:21:07.111 --> 01:21:10.410
<v Speaker 2>take his organs out and then section his body off and then cook it and eat it.</v>

3118
01:21:10.411 --> 01:21:14.460
<v Speaker 2>Like there is no confusion as to where that meat came from and there's a</v>

3119
01:21:14.490 --> 01:21:17.670
<v Speaker 2>complete direct attachment I'd say.</v>

3120
01:21:17.671 --> 01:21:19.010
<v Speaker 2>Then it becomes sorry,</v>

3121
01:21:19.030 --> 01:21:22.050
<v Speaker 2>but then it becomes sort of a philosophical debate.</v>

3122
01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:23.370
<v Speaker 2>Like is that what you want to do?</v>

3123
01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:28.140
<v Speaker 2>Do you want to just kill nature natural animals and eat them or do you want to</v>

3124
01:21:28.141 --> 01:21:33.141
<v Speaker 2>just remain to be a part of this sort of strange disconnect system where we are</v>

3125
01:21:34.621 --> 01:21:38.940
<v Speaker 2>all getting meat and not even thinking for a second that that used to be an</v>

3126
01:21:38.941 --> 01:21:39.270
<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>

3127
01:21:39.270 --> 01:21:43.080
<v Speaker 2>We have like no intellectual connection with the idea that that was a lot of it</v>

3128
01:21:43.081 --> 01:21:43.530
<v Speaker 2>came from,</v>

3129
01:21:43.530 --> 01:21:43.801
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3130
01:21:43.801 --> 01:21:44.580
<v Speaker 2>we just eat it.</v>

3131
01:21:44.580 --> 01:21:44.821
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3132
01:21:44.821 --> 01:21:46.770
<v Speaker 2>and especially we eat this really unhealthy stuff.</v>

3133
01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:49.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even close.</v>

3134
01:21:49.860 --> 01:21:50.693
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't even make sense.</v>

3135
01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:51.440
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3136
01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:53.100
<v Speaker 2>it's weird to fucking weird,</v>

3137
01:21:53.130 --> 01:21:53.491
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3138
01:21:53.491 --> 01:21:54.324
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

3139
01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:57.090
<v Speaker 2>it's a neon outside that while you were all,</v>

3140
01:21:57.100 --> 01:21:57.720
<v Speaker 2>you're like eating,</v>

3141
01:21:57.720 --> 01:21:58.800
<v Speaker 2>this is like going through your mind.</v>

3142
01:21:59.160 --> 01:21:59.521
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3143
01:21:59.521 --> 01:22:00.100
<v Speaker 2>because while we can,</v>

3144
01:22:00.100 --> 01:22:00.730
<v Speaker 2>I would just be like,</v>

3145
01:22:00.730 --> 01:22:01.830
<v Speaker 2>this is delicious.</v>

3146
01:22:01.860 --> 01:22:02.641
<v Speaker 2>Why was he getting it?</v>

3147
01:22:02.641 --> 01:22:03.900
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking this delicious,</v>

3148
01:22:03.901 --> 01:22:04.681
<v Speaker 2>but it was also thinking,</v>

3149
01:22:04.681 --> 01:22:04.861
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3150
01:22:04.861 --> 01:22:05.430
<v Speaker 2>this is like,</v>

3151
01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:07.320
<v Speaker 2>this is a serious thing that just happened,</v>

3152
01:22:07.321 --> 01:22:07.890
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3153
01:22:07.890 --> 01:22:09.900
<v Speaker 2>And I got to treat this serious thing with,</v>

3154
01:22:09.901 --> 01:22:10.440
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3155
01:22:10.440 --> 01:22:11.370
<v Speaker 2>with respect.</v>

3156
01:22:11.371 --> 01:22:14.820
<v Speaker 2>And someone said on my message board wants that hunting was psychedelic,</v>

3157
01:22:14.821 --> 01:22:16.230
<v Speaker 2>that he felt hunting with psychedelic.</v>

3158
01:22:16.530 --> 01:22:17.060
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

3159
01:22:17.060 --> 01:22:17.220
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3160
01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:18.060
<v Speaker 2>that's ridiculous.</v>

3161
01:22:18.060 --> 01:22:18.893
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like,</v>

3162
01:22:18.990 --> 01:22:19.823
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like,</v>

3163
01:22:19.980 --> 01:22:21.750
<v Speaker 2>it sounds like you don't know what psychedelic means,</v>

3164
01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:22.021
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3165
01:22:22.021 --> 01:22:22.920
<v Speaker 2>That's what I was thinking.</v>

3166
01:22:22.970 --> 01:22:24.690
<v Speaker 2>Like how could that be psychedelic?</v>

3167
01:22:24.691 --> 01:22:25.501
<v Speaker 2>That's like the opposite.</v>

3168
01:22:25.501 --> 01:22:25.880
<v Speaker 2>It's like adult,</v>

3169
01:22:25.880 --> 01:22:27.930
<v Speaker 2>like you're like killing an animal and you're,</v>

3170
01:22:27.931 --> 01:22:29.040
<v Speaker 2>you're taking a life.</v>

3171
01:22:29.430 --> 01:22:31.050
<v Speaker 2>But then in doing it,</v>

3172
01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:33.360
<v Speaker 2>I think I didn't know what he meant or,</v>

3173
01:22:33.420 --> 01:22:34.171
<v Speaker 2>or what,</v>

3174
01:22:34.171 --> 01:22:35.190
<v Speaker 2>what it could mean.</v>

3175
01:22:35.670 --> 01:22:39.530
<v Speaker 2>What psychedelic about it is that you,</v>

3176
01:22:39.531 --> 01:22:44.531
<v Speaker 2>you are in a totally different world when you're there and you're in nature.</v>

3177
01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:45.031
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3178
01:22:45.031 --> 01:22:46.890
<v Speaker 2>And there's no cell phone signal and shows,</v>

3179
01:22:46.950 --> 01:22:47.641
<v Speaker 2>no radio,</v>

3180
01:22:47.641 --> 01:22:48.510
<v Speaker 2>there's no media.</v>

3181
01:22:48.690 --> 01:22:53.550
<v Speaker 2>Nothing is is in in front of you except nature and you're walking around in it</v>

3182
01:22:53.551 --> 01:22:57.040
<v Speaker 2>all day looking for an animal and then when you finally lock on to that and</v>

3183
01:22:57.090 --> 01:23:00.320
<v Speaker 2>you're doing this for days and days and he finally lock on to that animal and</v>

3184
01:23:00.330 --> 01:23:04.470
<v Speaker 2>then you take that animal's life and you see it and you become a part of this</v>

3185
01:23:04.471 --> 01:23:04.870
<v Speaker 2>experience,</v>

3186
01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:05.830
<v Speaker 2>then eat this thing.</v>

3187
01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:06.910
<v Speaker 2>You realize like Whoa,</v>

3188
01:23:06.911 --> 01:23:09.160
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden like I am in the wild.</v>

3189
01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:11.830
<v Speaker 2>Like I am literally immersed in the wild.</v>

3190
01:23:11.960 --> 01:23:14.260
<v Speaker 2>I have just slept in the wild aid,</v>

3191
01:23:14.261 --> 01:23:15.910
<v Speaker 2>an animal that I shot in the wild,</v>

3192
01:23:15.911 --> 01:23:17.080
<v Speaker 2>killed it in the wild,</v>

3193
01:23:17.081 --> 01:23:19.390
<v Speaker 2>cooked it in the wild on some trees.</v>

3194
01:23:19.391 --> 01:23:23.110
<v Speaker 2>We chop some wood and we made a campfire and cooked it over at Campfire.</v>

3195
01:23:23.290 --> 01:23:28.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean it is as wildlife immersive as is possible.</v>

3196
01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:29.650
<v Speaker 2>And when that happens,</v>

3197
01:23:29.651 --> 01:23:30.040
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3198
01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:34.690
<v Speaker 2>it's a real paradigm shifting moment and much like in a psychedelic experience</v>

3199
01:23:34.691 --> 01:23:35.321
<v Speaker 2>after it's over,</v>

3200
01:23:35.321 --> 01:23:35.621
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>

3201
01:23:35.621 --> 01:23:35.951
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

3202
01:23:35.951 --> 01:23:40.951
<v Speaker 2>I am going to take as much of that I can take with me and that's going to make</v>

3203
01:23:41.021 --> 01:23:42.100
<v Speaker 2>me a better person.</v>

3204
01:23:42.101 --> 01:23:43.690
<v Speaker 2>That's gonna make me a more honest person.</v>

3205
01:23:43.691 --> 01:23:44.770
<v Speaker 2>That's gonna I,</v>

3206
01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:46.930
<v Speaker 2>this is certainly a powerful experience.</v>

3207
01:23:46.931 --> 01:23:47.711
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to grow from it.</v>

3208
01:23:47.711 --> 01:23:50.530
<v Speaker 2>I think about that almost every time I trip or have tripped.</v>

3209
01:23:50.860 --> 01:23:52.690
<v Speaker 2>And that's exactly how I felt about this.</v>

3210
01:23:52.691 --> 01:23:53.800
<v Speaker 2>And in that way,</v>

3211
01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:55.000
<v Speaker 2>it's sort of psychedelic.</v>

3212
01:23:55.090 --> 01:23:56.500
<v Speaker 2>Did you trip it all while you were there?</v>

3213
01:23:56.590 --> 01:23:57.423
<v Speaker 2>Like a mustache?</v>

3214
01:23:57.570 --> 01:23:58.403
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3215
01:23:58.710 --> 01:23:59.543
<v Speaker 2>Freaked out.</v>

3216
01:23:59.930 --> 01:24:00.370
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3217
01:24:00.370 --> 01:24:00.701
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3218
01:24:00.701 --> 01:24:01.690
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't have freaked out,</v>

3219
01:24:01.691 --> 01:24:02.200
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>

3220
01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:03.033
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

3221
01:24:03.130 --> 01:24:04.480
<v Speaker 2>there was no time to fuck around.</v>

3222
01:24:04.510 --> 01:24:04.931
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3223
01:24:04.931 --> 01:24:05.420
<v Speaker 2>this was a,</v>

3224
01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:05.711
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

3225
01:24:05.711 --> 01:24:06.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3226
01:24:06.250 --> 01:24:08.620
<v Speaker 2>it was a difficult endeavor.</v>

3227
01:24:08.650 --> 01:24:09.820
<v Speaker 2>The way he does it.</v>

3228
01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:10.450
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

3229
01:24:10.450 --> 01:24:13.840
<v Speaker 2>you don't have time to like go do mushrooms and lie around the grass for six</v>

3230
01:24:13.841 --> 01:24:14.674
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>

3231
01:24:16.110 --> 01:24:18.460
<v Speaker 2>You're up wandering through the hills of the rifle.</v>

3232
01:24:18.461 --> 01:24:22.240
<v Speaker 2>And if I had cotton all the way there with them and then decided to just do</v>

3233
01:24:22.241 --> 01:24:22.781
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms,</v>

3234
01:24:22.781 --> 01:24:27.781
<v Speaker 2>they'll be like so disrespectful to show and so disrespectful to what he's</v>

3235
01:24:27.791 --> 01:24:30.760
<v Speaker 2>trying to do because when he's trying to do is with his show,</v>

3236
01:24:30.761 --> 01:24:35.761
<v Speaker 2>he's trying to do these really difficult and challenging hunts and he took me</v>

3237
01:24:35.951 --> 01:24:38.260
<v Speaker 2>along to do it exactly the way he does it,</v>

3238
01:24:38.440 --> 01:24:38.711
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3239
01:24:38.711 --> 01:24:40.250
<v Speaker 2>So I had to do it the way he does.</v>

3240
01:24:40.280 --> 01:24:41.410
<v Speaker 2>Picture this picture of this.</v>

3241
01:24:42.130 --> 01:24:43.170
<v Speaker 3>You've got that on day three.</v>

3242
01:24:43.171 --> 01:24:44.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't have a feeling it's going to be a gang question.</v>

3243
01:24:45.410 --> 01:24:46.750
<v Speaker 3>You and Karen,</v>

3244
01:24:48.610 --> 01:24:50.010
<v Speaker 3>you're on Brokeback mountain.</v>

3245
01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:51.833
<v Speaker 3>Beautiful.</v>

3246
01:24:51.990 --> 01:24:52.530
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

3247
01:24:52.530 --> 01:24:52.741
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

3248
01:24:52.741 --> 01:24:53.970
<v Speaker 3>You get this thing on day three,</v>

3249
01:24:54.150 --> 01:24:55.980
<v Speaker 3>you're back to your last campsite.</v>

3250
01:24:56.010 --> 01:24:57.050
<v Speaker 3>You still have a day and a half left,</v>

3251
01:24:57.210 --> 01:24:57.530
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3252
01:24:57.530 --> 01:24:57.751
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

3253
01:24:57.751 --> 01:24:57.991
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

3254
01:24:57.991 --> 01:24:58.411
<v Speaker 3>we did it.</v>

3255
01:24:58.411 --> 01:24:58.950
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

3256
01:24:58.950 --> 01:25:02.100
<v Speaker 3>Come and come to terms with that stuff and you're undoing your sleeping bag and</v>

3257
01:25:02.101 --> 01:25:02.670
<v Speaker 3>stuff.</v>

3258
01:25:02.670 --> 01:25:02.881
<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

3259
01:25:02.881 --> 01:25:02.981
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3260
01:25:02.981 --> 01:25:04.200
<v Speaker 3>actually where my code is actually cold.</v>

3261
01:25:04.201 --> 01:25:05.130
<v Speaker 3>And you reached in your pocket like,</v>

3262
01:25:05.160 --> 01:25:07.110
<v Speaker 3>Oh fuck hey guys,</v>

3263
01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:08.611
<v Speaker 3>I forgot these written here.</v>

3264
01:25:08.611 --> 01:25:09.750
<v Speaker 3>I just found these mushrooms,</v>

3265
01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:11.153
<v Speaker 3>which do him then.</v>

3266
01:25:11.220 --> 01:25:11.920
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

3267
01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:12.530
<v Speaker 2>MMM.</v>

3268
01:25:12.530 --> 01:25:13.370
<v Speaker 2>That's interesting.</v>

3269
01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:15.590
<v Speaker 2>Everybody could do all the problem is,</v>

3270
01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:16.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3271
01:25:16.030 --> 01:25:19.850
<v Speaker 2>I would want to not be incapacitated in case something went wrong.</v>

3272
01:25:20.330 --> 01:25:22.850
<v Speaker 2>He never know what could go wrong when you're camping,</v>

3273
01:25:23.150 --> 01:25:26.030
<v Speaker 2>you know the idea that you're just going to sit there and you'd do the mushrooms</v>

3274
01:25:26.031 --> 01:25:27.320
<v Speaker 2>for five hours and you'll be fine.</v>

3275
01:25:27.530 --> 01:25:29.180
<v Speaker 2>That sounds good in theory.</v>

3276
01:25:29.181 --> 01:25:33.370
<v Speaker 2>However you need eight hours sleep and you really got to make sure you get that</v>

3277
01:25:33.371 --> 01:25:34.790
<v Speaker 2>cause you got a hard day ahead of you.</v>

3278
01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:35.960
<v Speaker 2>And second of all,</v>

3279
01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:39.650
<v Speaker 2>there's no five hour breaks there between the light being off,</v>

3280
01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:41.780
<v Speaker 2>eating your food and then sleeping for eight hours,</v>

3281
01:25:41.781 --> 01:25:43.340
<v Speaker 2>then getting up while it's still dark out,</v>

3282
01:25:43.490 --> 01:25:44.210
<v Speaker 2>there's really not,</v>

3283
01:25:44.210 --> 01:25:45.350
<v Speaker 2>there's no time to do it.</v>

3284
01:25:45.650 --> 01:25:49.100
<v Speaker 2>So I wouldn't have done it because there was still work to be done.</v>

3285
01:25:49.101 --> 01:25:52.370
<v Speaker 2>I still had to go back up there and get the deer itself and cut it apart and</v>

3286
01:25:52.371 --> 01:25:53.780
<v Speaker 2>that stuff takes hours.</v>

3287
01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:54.973
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't easy,</v>

3288
01:25:55.430 --> 01:25:56.090
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

3289
01:25:56.090 --> 01:25:56.960
<v Speaker 2>Oh you went back.</v>

3290
01:25:57.050 --> 01:25:57.381
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3291
01:25:57.381 --> 01:26:01.160
<v Speaker 2>So there was no time to do mushrooms and then the next morning Brian got his.</v>

3292
01:26:01.310 --> 01:26:01.761
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

3293
01:26:01.761 --> 01:26:02.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3294
01:26:02.060 --> 01:26:06.260
<v Speaker 2>he helped me go and get my dear and cut it up and that's when he was jerking off</v>

3295
01:26:06.261 --> 01:26:06.890
<v Speaker 2>into the sea.</v>

3296
01:26:06.890 --> 01:26:09.050
<v Speaker 2>He call himself the ravine calmer.</v>

3297
01:26:10.010 --> 01:26:10.843
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

3298
01:26:11.680 --> 01:26:12.050
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3299
01:26:12.050 --> 01:26:12.441
<v Speaker 2>it was,</v>

3300
01:26:12.441 --> 01:26:16.370
<v Speaker 2>the whole experience was a very surreal from the,</v>

3301
01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:19.820
<v Speaker 2>from pulling the trigger to watch the animal fall into its back.</v>

3302
01:26:20.030 --> 01:26:22.310
<v Speaker 2>It's very surreal to,</v>

3303
01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:22.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3304
01:26:22.670 --> 01:26:23.660
<v Speaker 2>ending its life,</v>

3305
01:26:24.710 --> 01:26:25.071
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3306
01:26:25.071 --> 01:26:27.140
<v Speaker 2>to cutting it open and to eating it.</v>

3307
01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:29.270
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty fucking intense man.</v>

3308
01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:32.870
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's the most honest way to get food.</v>

3309
01:26:32.930 --> 01:26:33.710
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>

3310
01:26:33.710 --> 01:26:35.350
<v Speaker 2>I think that's the most honest way to get meat.</v>

3311
01:26:35.550 --> 01:26:35.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>

3312
01:26:35.820 --> 01:26:36.140
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

3313
01:26:36.140 --> 01:26:36.920
<v Speaker 2>I can't say that.</v>

3314
01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:40.280
<v Speaker 2>I mean I'm not in a position where I could eat all my meat like that,</v>

3315
01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:42.230
<v Speaker 2>but I think that's the right way to do it.</v>

3316
01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:46.340
<v Speaker 2>I think if I didn't have this kind of traveling standup comedy schedule,</v>

3317
01:26:46.580 --> 01:26:50.150
<v Speaker 2>if I was able to live in one place for long periods of time,</v>

3318
01:26:50.151 --> 01:26:50.840
<v Speaker 2>I would do that.</v>

3319
01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:52.250
<v Speaker 2>That would get all my meat from game.</v>

3320
01:26:53.060 --> 01:26:54.620
<v Speaker 2>I think if you want to choose to eat meat,</v>

3321
01:26:54.860 --> 01:26:56.060
<v Speaker 2>that's the most honest way to do it.</v>

3322
01:26:56.090 --> 01:26:59.240
<v Speaker 2>Not saying there's anything wrong with having a steak border.</v>

3323
01:26:59.270 --> 01:27:01.370
<v Speaker 2>Farmers come to like the big city.</v>

3324
01:27:02.180 --> 01:27:02.710
<v Speaker 2>I'd be like,</v>

3325
01:27:02.710 --> 01:27:02.990
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

3326
01:27:02.990 --> 01:27:05.630
<v Speaker 2>you can just find me at the supermarket you don't like.</v>

3327
01:27:05.631 --> 01:27:06.920
<v Speaker 2>It's just so much better.</v>

3328
01:27:07.250 --> 01:27:08.750
<v Speaker 2>Why are we fooling ourselves?</v>

3329
01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:10.250
<v Speaker 2>Are you this and this?</v>

3330
01:27:10.490 --> 01:27:12.050
<v Speaker 2>It's the most honest way to get your meat.</v>

3331
01:27:12.530 --> 01:27:14.360
<v Speaker 2>I think there's something about farming,</v>

3332
01:27:14.390 --> 01:27:18.250
<v Speaker 2>much like something about hunter hunter on it.</v>

3333
01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:20.360
<v Speaker 2>I think there's something primal about it.</v>

3334
01:27:20.420 --> 01:27:23.450
<v Speaker 2>I do like picking something off of a tree or Bush and eating it right there.</v>

3335
01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:25.000
<v Speaker 2>You know what I like growing it,</v>

3336
01:27:25.300 --> 01:27:26.270
<v Speaker 2>growing things lately,</v>

3337
01:27:26.271 --> 01:27:26.960
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

3338
01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:28.070
<v Speaker 2>there's something cool that,</v>

3339
01:27:28.280 --> 01:27:30.170
<v Speaker 2>you know we went to Underwood farms,</v>

3340
01:27:30.210 --> 01:27:33.140
<v Speaker 2>they have this like a big farm where you can pick out your own food.</v>

3341
01:27:33.410 --> 01:27:36.100
<v Speaker 2>He'd go and pick out your own pumpkin's for Halloween.</v>

3342
01:27:36.110 --> 01:27:38.390
<v Speaker 2>You could pick out like all kinds of different things that they grow there and</v>

3343
01:27:38.391 --> 01:27:39.680
<v Speaker 2>then you bring it back and you pay for it.</v>

3344
01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:40.530
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

3345
01:27:40.530 --> 01:27:42.920
<v Speaker 2>I looked at him like how difficult would this be to do?</v>

3346
01:27:42.921 --> 01:27:46.550
<v Speaker 2>Because it seems like a really smart thing to do to have like a bunch of food</v>

3347
01:27:46.551 --> 01:27:47.660
<v Speaker 2>growing in our yard.</v>

3348
01:27:47.710 --> 01:27:51.860
<v Speaker 2>So I have a place like what if we had like death squad farms where we all,</v>

3349
01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:53.110
<v Speaker 2>we all grew our,</v>

3350
01:27:53.111 --> 01:27:56.570
<v Speaker 2>our our food like hired someone to run a farm,</v>

3351
01:27:56.571 --> 01:27:57.530
<v Speaker 2>buy a piece of land,</v>

3352
01:27:57.531 --> 01:28:01.490
<v Speaker 2>set up an irrigation system and that way we know where all our Kale comes from.</v>

3353
01:28:01.490 --> 01:28:02.810
<v Speaker 2>Our strawberries come from.</v>

3354
01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:07.460
<v Speaker 2>That seems like that would be a toggle rhubarb's obviously step one on the way</v>

3355
01:28:07.461 --> 01:28:08.990
<v Speaker 2>to the cult compound slash.</v>

3356
01:28:08.991 --> 01:28:09.824
<v Speaker 2>Farm.</v>

3357
01:28:10.370 --> 01:28:13.370
<v Speaker 2>But we start with a farm because nobody can argue with the farm.</v>

3358
01:28:13.460 --> 01:28:15.590
<v Speaker 2>If you start with a cult then all of a sudden they're like,</v>

3359
01:28:15.591 --> 01:28:16.071
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

3360
01:28:16.071 --> 01:28:16.904
<v Speaker 2>you guys just can't,</v>

3361
01:28:17.300 --> 01:28:17.721
<v Speaker 2>can't go.</v>

3362
01:28:17.721 --> 01:28:18.680
<v Speaker 2>I'll call to on us.</v>

3363
01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:19.791
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

3364
01:28:19.791 --> 01:28:21.560
<v Speaker 2>if you started off with a farm and like listen man,</v>

3365
01:28:21.561 --> 01:28:22.910
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to make it tomatoes.</v>

3366
01:28:23.450 --> 01:28:26.450
<v Speaker 2>How long and how many years before somebody is like,</v>

3367
01:28:26.630 --> 01:28:29.570
<v Speaker 2>so take up arms pretty quickly.</v>

3368
01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:30.493
<v Speaker 2>I think right away.</v>

3369
01:28:30.550 --> 01:28:31.730
<v Speaker 2>As soon as you start killing deer,</v>

3370
01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:33.740
<v Speaker 2>then we need guns to kill deer.</v>

3371
01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:35.313
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3372
01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:36.860
<v Speaker 2>that would be this shit.</v>

3373
01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:41.990
<v Speaker 2>If you could grow your own food and live off of wild game and vegetables that</v>

3374
01:28:41.991 --> 01:28:44.930
<v Speaker 2>you grow in that as a very close to nature way to live.</v>

3375
01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:49.670
<v Speaker 2>The argument against killing animals obviously is they're beautiful and you</v>

3376
01:28:49.671 --> 01:28:49.821
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

3377
01:28:49.821 --> 01:28:51.560
<v Speaker 2>why would you do that and this and that,</v>

3378
01:28:51.561 --> 01:28:53.170
<v Speaker 2>but the bottom line is you,</v>

3379
01:28:53.171 --> 01:28:56.840
<v Speaker 2>you need to maintain populations because if humans don't maintain the</v>

3380
01:28:56.841 --> 01:28:57.621
<v Speaker 2>population,</v>

3381
01:28:57.621 --> 01:29:01.770
<v Speaker 2>then we have to give up our spot as the number one Predator and bring somebody</v>

3382
01:29:01.771 --> 01:29:06.771
<v Speaker 2>else in to Duke decided we would rather kill a deer than have to worry about</v>

3383
01:29:06.871 --> 01:29:11.520
<v Speaker 2>heading one with our cars and worry about all the different predators that will</v>

3384
01:29:11.550 --> 01:29:16.080
<v Speaker 2>grow in size and number if you are not killing those deals because then they</v>

3385
01:29:16.081 --> 01:29:17.250
<v Speaker 2>have more food.</v>

3386
01:29:17.710 --> 01:29:19.020
<v Speaker 2>So it goes on from there.</v>

3387
01:29:19.021 --> 01:29:19.201
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3388
01:29:19.201 --> 01:29:20.070
<v Speaker 2>that's well look,</v>

3389
01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:24.990
<v Speaker 2>a lot of folks don't realize that wolves were a real problem in this world at</v>

3390
01:29:24.991 --> 01:29:25.824
<v Speaker 2>one point in time.</v>

3391
01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:28.140
<v Speaker 2>It seems so strange to say,</v>

3392
01:29:28.350 --> 01:29:31.830
<v Speaker 2>but like big bad wolf and Little Red Riding Hood and all that Shit,</v>

3393
01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:36.360
<v Speaker 2>what all those stories come from is at one point time wolves keys to kill</v>

3394
01:29:36.361 --> 01:29:36.870
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

3395
01:29:36.870 --> 01:29:39.000
<v Speaker 2>It was normal in France.</v>

3396
01:29:39.450 --> 01:29:39.631
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3397
01:29:39.631 --> 01:29:42.510
<v Speaker 2>I gotta I gotta pull this up because I saw this and I just want to make sure</v>

3398
01:29:42.511 --> 01:29:45.930
<v Speaker 2>that I quote this correctly because it's curry easy.</v>

3399
01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:46.680
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

3400
01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:47.850
<v Speaker 2>The Wolf Crop?</v>

3401
01:29:47.851 --> 01:29:48.550
<v Speaker 2>Barely pig.</v>

3402
01:29:48.550 --> 01:29:48.781
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3403
01:29:48.781 --> 01:29:53.160
<v Speaker 2>Wolves killed like 40 people and then in the 14 hundreds in France.</v>

3404
01:29:53.161 --> 01:29:56.430
<v Speaker 2>In Paris for 40 fucking people.</v>

3405
01:29:56.460 --> 01:29:56.671
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3406
01:29:56.671 --> 01:29:57.950
<v Speaker 2>The wolves of Paris.</v>

3407
01:29:57.951 --> 01:29:59.610
<v Speaker 2>He's such a horrible way to die,</v>

3408
01:29:59.640 --> 01:30:00.330
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>

3409
01:30:00.330 --> 01:30:01.530
<v Speaker 2>You can't wolf</v>

3410
01:30:03.300 --> 01:30:08.300
<v Speaker 2>the wolves of Paris like walking dead in 1450 the animals entered into the city</v>

3411
01:30:08.701 --> 01:30:11.430
<v Speaker 2>during the winter through breaches in the walls.</v>

3412
01:30:11.820 --> 01:30:13.690
<v Speaker 2>They put walls up the kitchen to kick him out.</v>

3413
01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:14.380
<v Speaker 2>Wait how,</v>

3414
01:30:14.380 --> 01:30:19.380
<v Speaker 2>what year a wolf nit 1450 a wolf name core Todd or bobtail was the leader of the</v>

3415
01:30:19.861 --> 01:30:24.060
<v Speaker 2>pack and reports of the animal being reddish in color may be indicative of a</v>

3416
01:30:24.061 --> 01:30:25.260
<v Speaker 2>Liberian wolf,</v>

3417
01:30:25.261 --> 01:30:29.240
<v Speaker 2>perhaps having migrated from the Pi Rennie's.</v>

3418
01:30:29.290 --> 01:30:30.000
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

3419
01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:35.000
<v Speaker 2>Eventually the wolves were killed when the precautions furious at the desk lured</v>

3420
01:30:35.310 --> 01:30:39.540
<v Speaker 2>core Todd and his pack into this heart of the city and they had the prescience</v>

3421
01:30:39.541 --> 01:30:44.541
<v Speaker 2>stoned and speared to death the wolves in front of the Notre Dame Cathedral.</v>

3422
01:30:45.510 --> 01:30:46.343
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3423
01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:48.660
<v Speaker 2>They speared them to death in front of the cathedral,</v>

3424
01:30:48.661 --> 01:30:49.950
<v Speaker 2>like a cornered the wolves,</v>

3425
01:30:50.220 --> 01:30:52.500
<v Speaker 2>like people were literally fighting for their lives against.</v>

3426
01:30:52.530 --> 01:30:54.750
<v Speaker 2>Why do you know how horrifying that must've been?</v>

3427
01:30:55.420 --> 01:30:55.710
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3428
01:30:55.710 --> 01:30:57.300
<v Speaker 2>that's where the w the Werewolf,</v>

3429
01:30:57.610 --> 01:30:58.031
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3430
01:30:58.031 --> 01:30:59.880
<v Speaker 2>the myth of werewolves come from real.</v>

3431
01:30:59.890 --> 01:31:03.480
<v Speaker 2>Wolf's comes from real world walls and walls being smart as shit.</v>

3432
01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:04.620
<v Speaker 2>They're so smart.</v>

3433
01:31:04.621 --> 01:31:05.820
<v Speaker 2>They seem like they're people.</v>

3434
01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:06.900
<v Speaker 2>They hunt in packs.</v>

3435
01:31:06.940 --> 01:31:08.730
<v Speaker 2>They have the Alphas and the Betas.</v>

3436
01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:10.110
<v Speaker 2>If they have a system,</v>

3437
01:31:10.270 --> 01:31:12.630
<v Speaker 2>power holes when solar system,</v>

3438
01:31:12.750 --> 01:31:15.000
<v Speaker 2>what's that naming this market below houses down.</v>

3439
01:31:15.170 --> 01:31:15.480
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3440
01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:16.313
<v Speaker 2>the old days.</v>

3441
01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:19.100
<v Speaker 2>The old days before they started smoking and he's,</v>

3442
01:31:19.150 --> 01:31:20.160
<v Speaker 2>they got him to cool,</v>

3443
01:31:20.190 --> 01:31:20.550
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

3444
01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:24.780
<v Speaker 2>Menthols and they just fucking ruined their huff and puff it on the old ladies</v>

3445
01:31:24.781 --> 01:31:25.411
<v Speaker 2>clothing too.</v>

3446
01:31:25.411 --> 01:31:27.190
<v Speaker 2>And Try to fool a little girls.</v>

3447
01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:27.451
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3448
01:31:27.451 --> 01:31:28.950
<v Speaker 2>They can talk in English back in the day.</v>

3449
01:31:30.180 --> 01:31:31.013
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3450
01:31:31.710 --> 01:31:32.543
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

3451
01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:33.140
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

3452
01:31:33.140 --> 01:31:34.800
<v Speaker 2>so that's what always scares me about camping.</v>

3453
01:31:34.801 --> 01:31:37.950
<v Speaker 2>It's like what if one of those things comes up in my tent?</v>

3454
01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:38.281
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3455
01:31:38.281 --> 01:31:40.140
<v Speaker 2>it's a problem when you're not armed and it's a problem.</v>

3456
01:31:40.141 --> 01:31:41.340
<v Speaker 2>There's not that many of you,</v>

3457
01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:41.881
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3458
01:31:41.881 --> 01:31:42.121
<v Speaker 2>when,</v>

3459
01:31:42.121 --> 01:31:43.110
<v Speaker 2>when we were with,</v>

3460
01:31:43.111 --> 01:31:43.500
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3461
01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:44.490
<v Speaker 2>the media to crew,</v>

3462
01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:46.740
<v Speaker 2>it was a one,</v>

3463
01:31:46.741 --> 01:31:47.550
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

3464
01:31:47.550 --> 01:31:48.301
<v Speaker 2>three,</v>

3465
01:31:48.301 --> 01:31:48.631
<v Speaker 2>four,</v>

3466
01:31:48.631 --> 01:31:49.351
<v Speaker 2>five,</v>

3467
01:31:49.351 --> 01:31:49.921
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>

3468
01:31:49.921 --> 01:31:50.910
<v Speaker 2>seven.</v>

3469
01:31:51.090 --> 01:31:52.920
<v Speaker 2>It was like all together there was,</v>

3470
01:31:52.921 --> 01:31:54.450
<v Speaker 2>I believe there was nine of us,</v>

3471
01:31:55.230 --> 01:31:56.640
<v Speaker 2>so there was quite a few.</v>

3472
01:31:56.641 --> 01:31:59.680
<v Speaker 2>If Pete may have those big wolf just in the middle of the night,</v>

3473
01:31:59.710 --> 01:32:01.980
<v Speaker 2>just start to be a problem.</v>

3474
01:32:01.990 --> 01:32:04.510
<v Speaker 2>Like how long until the first person that wakes up gets his gun out?</v>

3475
01:32:04.660 --> 01:32:04.901
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3476
01:32:04.901 --> 01:32:05.890
<v Speaker 2>Well that's the middle of the night.</v>

3477
01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:06.960
<v Speaker 2>Did you see the gray?</v>

3478
01:32:06.960 --> 01:32:07.131
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3479
01:32:07.131 --> 01:32:08.340
<v Speaker 2>but that's my understanding about the grade.</v>

3480
01:32:08.341 --> 01:32:09.940
<v Speaker 2>Why did they always kind of one by one?</v>

3481
01:32:09.941 --> 01:32:10.181
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

3482
01:32:10.181 --> 01:32:11.170
<v Speaker 2>just kill everyone.</v>

3483
01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:12.430
<v Speaker 2>There's the wolves.</v>

3484
01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:13.480
<v Speaker 2>12 if you wolves,</v>

3485
01:32:13.790 --> 01:32:14.710
<v Speaker 2>you can't do shit.</v>

3486
01:32:14.910 --> 01:32:16.890
<v Speaker 2>That's probably the only realistic thing about the movie.</v>

3487
01:32:16.910 --> 01:32:17.800
<v Speaker 2>The older one at a time.</v>

3488
01:32:17.801 --> 01:32:18.460
<v Speaker 2>Sneaky.</v>

3489
01:32:18.460 --> 01:32:18.701
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3490
01:32:18.701 --> 01:32:19.301
<v Speaker 2>Wolves are smart,</v>

3491
01:32:19.301 --> 01:32:19.780
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3492
01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:22.570
<v Speaker 2>They take their time when they were all walking towards the trees and the one,</v>

3493
01:32:22.590 --> 01:32:25.710
<v Speaker 2>the one guy fell back a little bit and they went nuts on him was like,</v>

3494
01:32:25.780 --> 01:32:26.613
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

3495
01:32:27.220 --> 01:32:28.570
<v Speaker 2>they just could have turned on the rest of them.</v>

3496
01:32:28.990 --> 01:32:29.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3497
01:32:29.440 --> 01:32:34.090
<v Speaker 2>But they might not of the mind that just that will wolves are very clever man.</v>

3498
01:32:34.091 --> 01:32:36.760
<v Speaker 2>That might be a realistic part of the movie that they saw the people running</v>

3499
01:32:36.761 --> 01:32:38.770
<v Speaker 2>back with guns that they would run away to.</v>

3500
01:32:38.771 --> 01:32:41.410
<v Speaker 2>We heard those wolves killed kill a skunk or on his campaign.</v>

3501
01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:41.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3502
01:32:41.890 --> 01:32:43.660
<v Speaker 2>It's just the yell they let out.</v>

3503
01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:45.250
<v Speaker 2>It's just so amazing.</v>

3504
01:32:45.670 --> 01:32:46.840
<v Speaker 2>They all just start howling.</v>

3505
01:32:46.841 --> 01:32:49.510
<v Speaker 2>Like we've done it where I was,</v>

3506
01:32:49.511 --> 01:32:51.500
<v Speaker 2>he didn't have to worry about wolves hear him.</v>

3507
01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:53.320
<v Speaker 2>But they do have an Idaho,</v>

3508
01:32:53.440 --> 01:32:54.460
<v Speaker 2>it's not that far away.</v>

3509
01:32:54.850 --> 01:32:55.031
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3510
01:32:55.031 --> 01:32:58.480
<v Speaker 2>they reintroduced him to the United States in Idaho.</v>

3511
01:32:58.570 --> 01:32:58.841
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3512
01:32:58.841 --> 01:33:02.050
<v Speaker 2>Well because they're worried about the uh,</v>

3513
01:33:02.051 --> 01:33:02.920
<v Speaker 2>the ecosystem.</v>

3514
01:33:02.921 --> 01:33:03.910
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to bring it back.</v>

3515
01:33:03.940 --> 01:33:05.410
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to reintroduce the predators.</v>

3516
01:33:05.440 --> 01:33:08.080
<v Speaker 2>It's really interesting cause it's having a devastating effect on the game,</v>

3517
01:33:08.530 --> 01:33:11.270
<v Speaker 2>but it's also to keep the door of the game populations in order.</v>

3518
01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:12.330
<v Speaker 2>But now that they're forced,</v>

3519
01:33:12.350 --> 01:33:16.150
<v Speaker 2>now they're forced to have wolf hunts cause the wolf's don't have any predators.</v>

3520
01:33:16.151 --> 01:33:18.580
<v Speaker 2>And the wolves used to have the Predator and the Predator was us.</v>

3521
01:33:18.880 --> 01:33:22.090
<v Speaker 2>So now people are hunting walls and now of course there's a lot of people that</v>

3522
01:33:22.091 --> 01:33:24.700
<v Speaker 2>are upset that people are hunting wolves and I used to agree with that.</v>

3523
01:33:24.700 --> 01:33:25.211
<v Speaker 2>I used to say,</v>

3524
01:33:25.211 --> 01:33:25.541
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

3525
01:33:25.541 --> 01:33:27.790
<v Speaker 2>you know the community on that you can't hunt fucking wolves.</v>

3526
01:33:27.791 --> 01:33:31.780
<v Speaker 2>That's fucked up because I think there's something majestic about a wolf and</v>

3527
01:33:31.781 --> 01:33:33.520
<v Speaker 2>there's something where you're not going to eat them.</v>

3528
01:33:33.521 --> 01:33:34.390
<v Speaker 2>And people were like,</v>

3529
01:33:34.391 --> 01:33:35.920
<v Speaker 2>why would you be able to hunt wolves?</v>

3530
01:33:36.250 --> 01:33:37.450
<v Speaker 2>But now it's you can eat them.</v>

3531
01:33:37.510 --> 01:33:37.871
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3532
01:33:37.871 --> 01:33:38.740
<v Speaker 2>but now as I get older,</v>

3533
01:33:38.741 --> 01:33:41.920
<v Speaker 2>I understand like you have to hunt them to keep the populations in control</v>

3534
01:33:41.921 --> 01:33:42.551
<v Speaker 2>because if you don't,</v>

3535
01:33:42.551 --> 01:33:45.700
<v Speaker 2>then they start going after livestock and they will go after people.</v>

3536
01:33:45.701 --> 01:33:48.250
<v Speaker 2>A woman got killed by a wolf this year in Alaska.</v>

3537
01:33:48.430 --> 01:33:49.840
<v Speaker 2>If there's more wolves,</v>

3538
01:33:49.841 --> 01:33:52.320
<v Speaker 2>so then that becomes less food for all of them to go around.</v>

3539
01:33:53.020 --> 01:33:54.160
<v Speaker 2>As those wolves die out,</v>

3540
01:33:54.161 --> 01:33:57.760
<v Speaker 2>they get crazy at the end and that's when it becomes a real look.</v>

3541
01:33:57.761 --> 01:34:00.280
<v Speaker 2>If you have an overpopulation problem with wolves and they don't have enough</v>

3542
01:34:00.281 --> 01:34:00.581
<v Speaker 2>food,</v>

3543
01:34:00.581 --> 01:34:03.650
<v Speaker 2>that becomes a real fun problems that to the population of girl,</v>

3544
01:34:03.651 --> 01:34:04.360
<v Speaker 2>that's all fine.</v>

3545
01:34:04.360 --> 01:34:04.571
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3546
01:34:04.571 --> 01:34:07.270
<v Speaker 2>So when everyone's looking at these wolves right now and saying like,</v>

3547
01:34:07.300 --> 01:34:07.650
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3548
01:34:07.650 --> 01:34:10.270
<v Speaker 2>I think it sucks that the people who are going to hunt wolves,</v>

3549
01:34:10.271 --> 01:34:12.160
<v Speaker 2>like they have to hunt them now,</v>

3550
01:34:12.230 --> 01:34:13.540
<v Speaker 2>if you don't hunt them down,</v>

3551
01:34:13.541 --> 01:34:17.050
<v Speaker 2>we're going to get to a situation where it's going to be a problem and the last</v>

3552
01:34:17.051 --> 01:34:19.090
<v Speaker 2>problem you want is a fucking wolf problem.</v>

3553
01:34:19.570 --> 01:34:22.720
<v Speaker 2>Imagine Wolf start just jacking people again on a regular base and we'll think</v>

3554
01:34:22.721 --> 01:34:27.010
<v Speaker 2>of how fucking stupid we were to let ourselves get to a situation when we built</v>

3555
01:34:27.011 --> 01:34:30.680
<v Speaker 2>the the murderer population back then people murdered.</v>

3556
01:34:30.700 --> 01:34:33.220
<v Speaker 2>Magic was walking down the street on Pasadena is a wolf.</v>

3557
01:34:33.221 --> 01:34:33.490
<v Speaker 2>I've don't,</v>

3558

<v Speaker 1>I'm saying 200 pounds.</v>

3588
01:35:05.241 --> 01:35:06.021
<v Speaker 1>I think that's how big.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It was fun.</v>

3590
01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:09.010
<v Speaker 1>I remember good dog,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3593
01:35:14.750 --> 01:35:15.583
<v Speaker 1>She says,</v>

3594
01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:16.731
<v Speaker 1>oh my God.</v>

3595
01:35:16.731 --> 01:35:17.391
<v Speaker 1>Is it true?</v>

3596
01:35:17.391 --> 01:35:18.470
<v Speaker 1>Is it really 200 pounds?</v>

3597
01:35:18.530 --> 01:35:19.550
<v Speaker 1>I know they get that bag.</v>

3598
01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:22.100
<v Speaker 1>Was there any moment of like right before you pulled the trigger,</v>

3599
01:35:22.160 --> 01:35:22.993
<v Speaker 1>did you like,</v>

3600
01:35:23.110 --> 01:35:26.330
<v Speaker 1>will you just zoned in on you like nothing to think about what I'm about to do,</v>

3601
01:35:26.331 --> 01:35:26.500
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3602
01:35:26.500 --> 01:35:26.631
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3603
01:35:26.631 --> 01:35:26.720
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3604
01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:26.871
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3605
01:35:26.871 --> 01:35:27.710
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think that.</v>

3606
01:35:27.711 --> 01:35:29.390
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted to make sure that I got the right shot.</v>

3607
01:35:29.420 --> 01:35:29.870
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>

3608
01:35:29.870 --> 01:35:32.480
<v Speaker 1>200 yards is a really far distance to shoot.</v>

3609
01:35:32.830 --> 01:35:33.200
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3610
01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:34.070
<v Speaker 1>That's why it didn't.</v>

3611
01:35:34.100 --> 01:35:35.090
<v Speaker 1>I tried to get it,</v>

3612
01:35:35.091 --> 01:35:36.320
<v Speaker 1>the bolt to go through his heart.</v>

3613
01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:39.860
<v Speaker 1>It didn't go through his heart landed right above the heart and a couple inches</v>

3614
01:35:39.861 --> 01:35:40.370
<v Speaker 1>of the hardware.</v>

3615
01:35:40.370 --> 01:35:41.031
<v Speaker 1>The spine is,</v>

3616
01:35:41.031 --> 01:35:42.920
<v Speaker 1>that's where it hit him and dropped him.</v>

3617
01:35:43.700 --> 01:35:44.410
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

3618
01:35:44.410 --> 01:35:45.740
<v Speaker 1>why did they tell you not to go with the head?</v>

3619
01:35:46.130 --> 01:35:49.400
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's harder to hit mountain lion killed and Santa Monica is probably</v>

3620
01:35:49.401 --> 01:35:50.420
<v Speaker 1>seeking at home.</v>

3621
01:35:51.140 --> 01:35:51.920
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3622
01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:53.120
<v Speaker 4>poor baby.</v>

3623
01:35:53.630 --> 01:35:54.463
<v Speaker 4>You think.</v>

3624
01:35:55.700 --> 01:35:57.280
<v Speaker 4>Oh</v>

<v Speaker 1>very powerful.</v>

3634
01:36:13.210 --> 01:36:15.610
<v Speaker 4>That was really weird that you called me hooky mine earlier.</v>

3635
01:36:15.611 --> 01:36:17.710
<v Speaker 4>And you had no idea that Pokemon in my car,</v>

3636
01:36:17.711 --> 01:36:18.040
<v Speaker 4>Joe,</v>

3637
01:36:18.040 --> 01:36:19.090
<v Speaker 4>maybe I did know.</v>

3638
01:36:19.210 --> 01:36:20.430
<v Speaker 4>Maybe I knew you silly baby.</v>

3639
01:36:20.730 --> 01:36:23.380
<v Speaker 4>You know I never talked about it and I'm tuned into the universe.</v>

3640
01:36:23.381 --> 01:36:24.340
<v Speaker 4>I'm a hunter now.</v>

3641
01:36:26.120 --> 01:36:29.290
<v Speaker 4>The spirit of the wild brain scanning me man.</v>

3642
01:36:31.700 --> 01:36:32.330
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3643
01:36:32.330 --> 01:36:32.861
<v Speaker 4>How did that,</v>

3644
01:36:32.861 --> 01:36:33.700
<v Speaker 4>it's really fucking weird though,</v>

3645
01:36:33.701 --> 01:36:34.061
<v Speaker 4>cause I haven't,</v>

3646
01:36:34.061 --> 01:36:35.760
<v Speaker 4>I don't think I've told you or dude,</v>

3647
01:36:35.761 --> 01:36:36.110
<v Speaker 4>I'm Bro,</v>

01:36:36.110 --> 01:36:37.630
<v Speaker 4>I'm a fucking brain scanner.</v>

3649
01:36:37.660 --> 01:36:38.510
<v Speaker 4>We've never done it.</v>

3650
01:36:39.230 --> 01:36:40.410
<v Speaker 4>But we've never talked Pokemon ever.</v>

3651
01:36:40.450 --> 01:36:41.380
<v Speaker 4>I've never told talk,</v>

3652
01:36:41.381 --> 01:36:42.131
<v Speaker 4>poke me ever to,</v>

3653
01:36:42.131 --> 01:36:45.970
<v Speaker 4>but if any one of us would have a Pokemon outfit,</v>

3654
01:36:46.120 --> 01:36:47.590
<v Speaker 4>you would be the winner of that.</v>

3655
01:36:47.591 --> 01:36:50.100
<v Speaker 4>Campbell I aside from God,</v>

3656
01:36:50.170 --> 01:36:51.720
<v Speaker 4>I put it in my car on the way here.</v>

3667
01:37:03.610 --> 01:37:03.731

3669
01:37:05.500 --> 01:37:06.333
<v Speaker 4>Halloween.</v>

3670
01:37:06.370 --> 01:37:08.350
<v Speaker 4>I hate it so much word.</v>

3671
01:37:08.410 --> 01:37:09.640
<v Speaker 4>So much pressure.</v>

3672
01:37:10.180 --> 01:37:11.140
<v Speaker 4>I got a gorilla outfit,</v>

3673
01:37:11.141 --> 01:37:12.250
<v Speaker 4>but it's way too hot.</v>

3674
01:37:12.251 --> 01:37:13.510
<v Speaker 4>I don't see how anyone could wear it.</v>

3675
01:37:13.511 --> 01:37:14.261
<v Speaker 4>Why is it pressure?</v>

3676
01:37:14.261 --> 01:37:16.060
<v Speaker 4>Are you so at negative and angry?</v>

3677
01:37:16.061 --> 01:37:18.280
<v Speaker 4>I don't put something on and it's like if you don't,</v>

3678
01:37:18.281 --> 01:37:18.911
<v Speaker 4>then it becomes like,</v>

3679
01:37:18.911 --> 01:37:19.121
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3680

<v Speaker 4>you didn't get one of these.</v>

3681
01:37:21.101 --> 01:37:21.640
<v Speaker 4>It's also,</v>

3682
01:37:21.640 --> 01:37:22.570
<v Speaker 4>you gotta explain it.</v>

3683
01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:23.140
<v Speaker 4>I just want to,</v>

3684

01:37:24.710 --> 01:37:25.543
<v Speaker 4>this is like,</v>

3689
01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:26.650

01:37:26.650 --> 01:37:27.520
<v Speaker 4>it's so soft.</v>

3691

<v Speaker 4>You just put it on.</v>

3692

<v Speaker 4>It's the worst.</v>

3724
01:38:06.281 --> 01:38:09.020
<v Speaker 4>When people fall in love and they feel like we got to make it public,</v>

3725
01:38:09.021 --> 01:38:09.940
<v Speaker 4>it's possible.</v>

01:38:13.190 --> 01:38:16.110
<v Speaker 4>It's worse than eating babies and shitting in people's mouths when they're</v>

3732
01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:16.973
<v Speaker 4>sleeping.</v>

<v Speaker 4>seeing a post about it.</v>

3747
01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:35.913
<v Speaker 4>Funny,</v>

3748
01:38:37.870 --> 01:38:40.900
<v Speaker 4>waiting on an airplane and they put their seats back and you were sitting behind</v>

3749
01:38:40.901 --> 01:38:44.370
<v Speaker 4>him and there were tweeting and there were tweeting picks it up that way.</v>

3750
01:38:44.380 --> 01:38:45.213
<v Speaker 4>The worst,</v>

3751
01:38:46.230 --> 01:38:49.930
<v Speaker 4>that's the worst because he cost the worst.</v>

3752
01:38:51.090 --> 01:38:53.660
<v Speaker 4>I had to sit in front of no liens or seat back all the way,</v>

3753
01:38:53.710 --> 01:38:54.450
<v Speaker 4>just saying,</v>

3754
01:38:54.450 --> 01:38:54.661
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3755
01:38:54.661 --> 01:38:58.830
<v Speaker 4>I don't respect the person's boundaries in any way behind me are their feelings</v>

3756
01:38:58.831 --> 01:39:00.180
<v Speaker 4>that I might be crushing their legs?</v>

3757
01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:00.661
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3758
01:39:00.661 --> 01:39:03.720
<v Speaker 4>they're saying I would like my seat to go back and I don't care about what</v>

3759
01:39:03.721 --> 01:39:06.800
<v Speaker 4>anyone else is doing that doesn't get your legs out of the way.</v>

3760
01:39:08.220 --> 01:39:09.300
<v Speaker 4>Has a little button.</v>

3761
01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.903
<v Speaker 4>That's what you're allowed to.</v>

3762
01:39:11.310 --> 01:39:14.290
<v Speaker 4>So then you were allowed to go back as far as they let you and what if they go</v>

3763
01:39:14.291 --> 01:39:15.210
<v Speaker 4>should go a little further back.</v>

3764
01:39:15.211 --> 01:39:15.481
<v Speaker 4>Where'd you go?</v>

3765
01:39:15.481 --> 01:39:16.314
<v Speaker 4>A little further back,</v>

3766
01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:18.360
<v Speaker 4>like as long as that was what was agreed to.</v>

3767
01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:19.081
<v Speaker 4>And what did they let you go?</v>

3768
01:39:19.081 --> 01:39:20.940
<v Speaker 4>All the way back to where you're lying on somebody's lap.</v>

3769
01:39:20.941 --> 01:39:21.774
<v Speaker 4>Would you do that?</v>

3770
01:39:21.950 --> 01:39:22.050
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3771
01:39:22.050 --> 01:39:25.050
<v Speaker 4>where'd you use your own mind and say just someone sitting back there or you</v>

3772
01:39:25.051 --> 01:39:27.090
<v Speaker 4>need some yoga and some Vicodin.</v>

3773
01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:28.590
<v Speaker 4>I would never do that.</v>

3774
01:39:28.591 --> 01:39:28.921
<v Speaker 4>That's not one.</v>

3775
01:39:28.921 --> 01:39:30.930
<v Speaker 4>I would never smashed their fucking legs with my,</v>

3776
01:39:30.931 --> 01:39:31.764
<v Speaker 4>with my chair.</v>

3777
01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:32.793
<v Speaker 4>It's a violent,</v>

3778
01:39:32.920 --> 01:39:33.753
<v Speaker 4>it's violence.</v>

3779
01:39:34.820 --> 01:39:36.380
<v Speaker 4>Like someone taking what?</v>

3780
01:39:36.420 --> 01:39:38.130
<v Speaker 4>You don't feel like you want to pick your seat back?</v>

3781
01:39:38.131 --> 01:39:38.880
<v Speaker 4>At what point?</v>

3782
01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:40.410
<v Speaker 4>Make sure I do uncomfortable,</v>

3783
01:39:40.411 --> 01:39:41.380
<v Speaker 4>especially as being a challenge,</v>

3784
01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:44.130
<v Speaker 4>but I don't put it back because someone is sitting back there.</v>

3785
01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:45.720
<v Speaker 4>But that's designed for that.</v>

3786
01:39:45.721 --> 01:39:46.560
<v Speaker 4>So they put this,</v>

3787
01:39:46.640 --> 01:39:47.280
<v Speaker 4>how far the design?</v>

3788
01:39:47.280 --> 01:39:47.821
<v Speaker 4>It's annoying.</v>

3789
01:39:47.821 --> 01:39:48.640
<v Speaker 4>You can't fucking,</v>

3790
01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:49.700
<v Speaker 4>you can't type on your computer.</v>

3791
01:39:49.710 --> 01:39:50.530
<v Speaker 4>Somebody leads back.</v>

3792
01:39:50.530 --> 01:39:52.310
<v Speaker 4>You need to get rich enough to get a private chat.</v>

3793
01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:53.220
<v Speaker 4>Unless you can't ever,</v>

3794
01:39:53.250 --> 01:39:55.390
<v Speaker 4>you can't ever look at your laptop when someone's laying back.</v>

3795
01:39:55.980 --> 01:39:56.100
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3796
01:39:56.100 --> 01:39:57.060

01:39:57.061 --> 01:39:57.894
<v Speaker 4>I forgot.</v>

3798
01:40:00.410 --> 01:40:01.080
<v Speaker 4>It's no worry.</v>

3799
01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:03.520
<v Speaker 4>Just shows a lack of caring about other humans.</v>

3800
01:40:03.530 --> 01:40:08.050
<v Speaker 4>Doesn't art shows you want to lean your seat back and I know that's the design.</v>

3801
01:40:08.051 --> 01:40:09.370
<v Speaker 4>That's the reason you're doing it.</v>

3802
01:40:09.410 --> 01:40:10.151
<v Speaker 4>But everyone does.</v>

3803
01:40:10.151 --> 01:40:11.990
<v Speaker 4>It is not a reason to do anything.</v>

3804
01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:14.280
<v Speaker 4>It is because everyone does it.</v>

3805
01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:15.700
<v Speaker 4>It's an agreement.</v>

3806
01:40:15.730 --> 01:40:16.563
<v Speaker 4>Yours,</v>

3807

<v Speaker 4>you're less comfortable when somebody smashing into your legs.</v>

3808
01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:21.160
<v Speaker 4>It's for then do it to someone else.</v>

3809
01:40:21.161 --> 01:40:22.330
<v Speaker 4>It's a horrible act.</v>

3810
01:40:22.620 --> 01:40:24.040
<v Speaker 4>It's a horrible self shop.</v>

3814
01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:27.340
<v Speaker 4>Knowing how bad it is,</v>

3815
01:40:27.341 --> 01:40:30.340

<v Speaker 4>Do you have it hates that.</v>

3847
01:41:18.550 --> 01:41:19.900
<v Speaker 4>It's a worse sending coaches.</v>

3848
01:41:19.900 --> 01:41:20.440
<v Speaker 4>If you have,</v>

3849
01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:22.180
<v Speaker 4>if you have your thing out and you're on your computer,</v>

3850
01:41:22.450 --> 01:41:23.890
<v Speaker 4>you can't be on your computer anymore.</v>

3851
01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:25.030
<v Speaker 4>It's too far back.</v>

3852
01:41:25.030 --> 01:41:25.151
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3853
01:41:25.151 --> 01:41:25.690
<v Speaker 4>you can't.</v>

3854
01:41:25.690 --> 01:41:26.380
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

3855
01:41:26.380 --> 01:41:27.400
<v Speaker 4>So that's annoying.</v>

3856
01:41:27.401 --> 01:41:27.611
<v Speaker 4>But yeah,</v>

3857
01:41:27.611 --> 01:41:31.810
<v Speaker 4>you'll still inflict that on someone else for the joy of leaning a little if you</v>

3858
01:41:31.811 --> 01:41:32.350
<v Speaker 4>want to,</v>

3859
01:41:32.350 --> 01:41:33.030
<v Speaker 4>you can do that.</v>

3860
01:41:33.030 --> 01:41:33.280
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3861
01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:33.910
<v Speaker 4>you're allowed.</v>

3862
01:41:33.910 --> 01:41:34.760
<v Speaker 4>The law allows it.</v>

3863
01:41:34.761 --> 01:41:35.880
<v Speaker 4>You're not there to visit.</v>

3864
01:41:35.881 --> 01:41:37.960
<v Speaker 4>Why government doesn't work cause everyone's corruptible.</v>

3865
01:41:37.990 --> 01:41:38.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3866
01:41:38.220 --> 01:41:38.950
<v Speaker 4>Where's the Dolphin?</v>

3867
01:41:38.950 --> 01:41:39.550
<v Speaker 4>It looks there.</v>

3868
01:41:39.550 --> 01:41:43.420
<v Speaker 4>You're not going to do anything there to sit in your seat and you're there to</v>

3869
01:41:43.421 --> 01:41:44.254
<v Speaker 4>get somewhere.</v>

3870
01:41:45.570 --> 01:41:48.920
<v Speaker 4>You can make it less painful airline's fault.</v>

3871
01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:49.833
<v Speaker 4>Not</v>

3872
01:41:50.920 --> 01:41:53.740
<v Speaker 4>because humans can't be trusted to think about others.</v>

3873
01:41:53.870 --> 01:41:54.160
<v Speaker 4>You're like,</v>

3874
01:41:54.160 --> 01:41:55.270
<v Speaker 4>they let me honestly,</v>

3875
01:41:55.271 --> 01:41:57.520
<v Speaker 4>if they let you go as far back as you want it all the way back,</v>

3876
01:41:57.640 --> 01:41:59.500
<v Speaker 4>a bunch of you motherfuckers would keep doing it.</v>

3877
01:41:59.530 --> 01:42:00.220
<v Speaker 4>They would.</v>

3878
01:42:00.220 --> 01:42:01.053
<v Speaker 4>They would.</v>

3879
01:42:01.540 --> 01:42:01.990
<v Speaker 4>They would.</v>

3880
01:42:01.990 --> 01:42:02.380
<v Speaker 4>There was like,</v>

3881
01:42:02.380 --> 01:42:03.220
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what goes there,</v>

3882
01:42:03.221 --> 01:42:06.970
<v Speaker 4>so I'm just going to do it and then get head because girls just would not be</v>

3883
01:42:06.971 --> 01:42:09.280
<v Speaker 4>able to help themselves and be dicks right next to their face.</v>

3884
01:42:09.340 --> 01:42:10.173
<v Speaker 4>It's an asshole.</v>

3885
01:42:10.260 --> 01:42:11.320
<v Speaker 4>We don't know what's happening.</v>

3886
01:42:11.350 --> 01:42:11.820
<v Speaker 4>I agree.</v>

3887
01:42:11.820 --> 01:42:11.990
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

3888
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:13.690
<v Speaker 4>are you really exaggerating here?</v>

3889
01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:14.290
<v Speaker 4>I'm not.</v>

3890
01:42:14.290 --> 01:42:14.591
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>

3891
01:42:14.591 --> 01:42:16.120
<v Speaker 4>what do you feel like it's selfish?</v>

3892
01:42:16.350 --> 01:42:17.500
<v Speaker 4>One knows what it does to people,</v>

3893
01:42:17.501 --> 01:42:18.131
<v Speaker 4>but you do it anyway.</v>

3894
01:42:18.131 --> 01:42:19.600
<v Speaker 4>It's just a small selfish act.</v>

3895
01:42:19.810 --> 01:42:21.250
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's that selfish.</v>

3896
01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:21.541
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3897
01:42:21.541 --> 01:42:22.090
<v Speaker 4>you don't.</v>

3898
01:42:22.090 --> 01:42:24.110
<v Speaker 4>I think it's something people never think they're doing anything wrong.</v>

3899
01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:26.370
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3900
01:42:26.590 --> 01:42:27.940
<v Speaker 4>it's just you're very tall guy,</v>

3901
01:42:27.941 --> 01:42:28.211
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

3902
01:42:28.211 --> 01:42:32.310
<v Speaker 4>It's very different for you than it is for me or Brian Guy Behind you.</v>

3903
01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:32.951
<v Speaker 4>Do you look and say,</v>

3904
01:42:32.951 --> 01:42:33.041
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

3905
01:42:33.041 --> 01:42:33.791
<v Speaker 4>he's a tall guy behind me.</v>

3906
01:42:33.791 --> 01:42:35.380
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to do this and person on that plane.</v>

3907
01:42:35.380 --> 01:42:37.000
<v Speaker 4>You need to understand that you're tall.</v>

3908
01:42:37.001 --> 01:42:38.590
<v Speaker 4>You need to spend the extra $40.</v>

3909
01:42:38.591 --> 01:42:40.750
<v Speaker 4>Did the business upgrade class or whatever,</v>

3910
01:42:40.751 --> 01:42:41.584
<v Speaker 4>exit row.</v>

3911
01:42:42.250 --> 01:42:43.990
<v Speaker 4>And that's what you see a short person behind me.</v>

3912
01:42:43.991 --> 01:42:47.160
<v Speaker 4>I still don't leave my chair back cause it fucking disrupt all your sweetie.</v>

3913
01:42:47.470 --> 01:42:49.270
<v Speaker 4>I'm just so selfless.</v>

3914
01:42:49.690 --> 01:42:50.171
<v Speaker 4>That's you,</v>

3915
01:42:50.171 --> 01:42:50.590
<v Speaker 4>Ari.</v>

3916
01:42:50.590 --> 01:42:53.970
<v Speaker 4>I just liked the fact that when somebody does lean back and stiff going,</v>

3917
01:42:54.070 --> 01:42:54.431
<v Speaker 4>ma'am,</v>

3918
01:42:54.431 --> 01:42:55.280
<v Speaker 4>I'm very tall,</v>

3919
01:42:55.281 --> 01:42:57.400
<v Speaker 4>but he just goes and starts kicking it,</v>

3920
01:42:57.750 --> 01:42:58.451
<v Speaker 4>like hitting him.</v>

3921
01:42:58.451 --> 01:42:59.080
<v Speaker 4>Whoa.</v>

3922
01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:03.230
<v Speaker 4>I think that was before he did mushrooms this years ago.</v>

3923
01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:05.833
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3924
01:43:05.980 --> 01:43:08.990
<v Speaker 4>but he doesn't even respond violently anymore.</v>

3925
01:43:09.100 --> 01:43:09.671
<v Speaker 4>You don't do that.</v>

3926
01:43:09.671 --> 01:43:10.481
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes I do this.</v>

3927
01:43:10.481 --> 01:43:10.840
<v Speaker 4>I say,</v>

3928
01:43:10.840 --> 01:43:11.680
<v Speaker 4>just so you know,</v>

3929
01:43:11.740 --> 01:43:11.980
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3930
01:43:11.980 --> 01:43:15.030
<v Speaker 4>you're going to make this very uncomfortable for me and I'm going to be paint.</v>

3931
01:43:15.031 --> 01:43:16.150
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to paint in my knee.</v>

3932
01:43:16.170 --> 01:43:17.170
<v Speaker 4>You said as you lean back,</v>

3933
01:43:17.171 --> 01:43:18.290
<v Speaker 4>but I know you're allowed,</v>

3934
01:43:18.291 --> 01:43:18.730
<v Speaker 4>but,</v>

3935
01:43:18.730 --> 01:43:20.190
<v Speaker 4>but just know that's what's going to happen to me.</v>

3936
01:43:20.470 --> 01:43:21.490
<v Speaker 4>Why don't you just ask them,</v>

3937
01:43:21.940 --> 01:43:23.230
<v Speaker 4>would you please read your mind?</v>

3938
01:43:23.231 --> 01:43:25.900
<v Speaker 4>I had a knee operations and I'm all fucked up and gangly.</v>

3939
01:43:26.350 --> 01:43:28.780
<v Speaker 4>Would you mind just that tall?</v>

3940
01:43:29.200 --> 01:43:30.020
<v Speaker 4>It's not crazy.</v>

3941
01:43:30.020 --> 01:43:30.760
<v Speaker 4>Five eight.</v>

3942
01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:30.971
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3943
01:43:30.971 --> 01:43:31.804
<v Speaker 4>you are.</v>

3944
01:43:31.810 --> 01:43:32.643
<v Speaker 4>That's so Tom,</v>

3945
01:43:32.710 --> 01:43:32.981
<v Speaker 4>you're,</v>

3946
01:43:32.981 --> 01:43:34.540
<v Speaker 4>you're taller than average.</v>

3947
01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:36.220
<v Speaker 4>Most people are like me and Joe size,</v>

3948
01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:37.900
<v Speaker 4>but you know where that difference is?</v>

3949
01:43:37.901 --> 01:43:39.700
<v Speaker 4>You're just talking about knee to waste.</v>

3950
01:43:40.030 --> 01:43:42.280
<v Speaker 4>That's the only difference in terms of where it affects your seat.</v>

3951
01:43:43.060 --> 01:43:44.920
<v Speaker 4>So those five inches,</v>

3952
01:43:46.390 --> 01:43:47.200
<v Speaker 4>seven inches.</v>

3953
01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:47.460
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

3954
01:43:47.460 --> 01:43:48.510
<v Speaker 4>how come I'm not going away?</v>

3955
01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:50.650
<v Speaker 4>It's going to be that much more.</v>

3956
01:43:50.950 --> 01:43:51.783
<v Speaker 4>He does</v>

3957
01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:53.890
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3958
01:43:53.890 --> 01:43:55.340
<v Speaker 1>Cap doesn't get crossed up.</v>

3959
01:43:55.550 --> 01:43:59.210
<v Speaker 1>You can do that weird thing where you can actually fold one leg over the top.</v>

3960
01:43:59.330 --> 01:44:01.400
<v Speaker 1>My little troll legs don't work that way.</v>

3961
01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:04.190
<v Speaker 1>I can't fold my leg over the top of my leg,</v>

3962
01:44:04.191 --> 01:44:05.024
<v Speaker 1>my legs.</v>

3963
01:44:05.660 --> 01:44:07.250
<v Speaker 1>I can only wear a certain types of pants.</v>

3964
01:44:07.460 --> 01:44:08.600
<v Speaker 1>Most pants I can't wear.</v>

3965
01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:12.260
<v Speaker 1>I can't like like Levi's five oh one I can't even get those on.</v>

3966
01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:13.011
<v Speaker 1>If they were,</v>

3967
01:44:13.011 --> 01:44:14.240
<v Speaker 1>if they fit my waist,</v>

3968
01:44:14.270 --> 01:44:15.350
<v Speaker 1>they never fit my legs.</v>

3969
01:44:15.410 --> 01:44:18.050
<v Speaker 1>They get onto my legs and they just lock up halfway.</v>

3970
01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:18.850
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

3971
01:44:18.850 --> 01:44:19.683
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3972
01:44:19.730 --> 01:44:20.840
<v Speaker 1>Cause you have thick thighs.</v>

3973
01:44:20.900 --> 01:44:21.560
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3974
01:44:21.560 --> 01:44:22.393
<v Speaker 1>Don't feel like a troll.</v>

3975
01:44:24.830 --> 01:44:28.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm five eight 190 pounds and most of it's in my legs and my ass.</v>

3976
01:44:28.940 --> 01:44:29.900
<v Speaker 1>Five eight one nine.</v>

3977
01:44:29.910 --> 01:44:30.860

3979
01:44:37.630 --> 01:44:39.140
<v Speaker 1>men is so different than women.</v>

3980
01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:41.120
<v Speaker 1>If a girl ever did that to her friend,</v>

3981
01:44:41.210 --> 01:44:43.120
<v Speaker 1>what do you way to tent Jesus?</v>

3983
01:44:45.860 --> 01:44:46.670
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it funny?</v>

3984
01:44:46.670 --> 01:44:46.971
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3985
01:44:46.971 --> 01:44:48.470
<v Speaker 1>Women are allowed to do that.</v>

4082
01:47:31.230 --> 01:47:32.370

4083
01:47:32.371 --> 01:47:33.151
<v Speaker 1>We've cleaned up the streets.</v>

4084
01:47:33.151 --> 01:47:34.590
<v Speaker 1>We were down to zero crime.</v>

4085
01:47:34.620 --> 01:47:35.160
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4086
01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:37.260
<v Speaker 1>How about high school kids are so we'd all right,</v>

4087
01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:39.780
<v Speaker 1>we'll go back to that and all have drugs first.</v>

4088
01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:41.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4089
01:47:41.230 --> 01:47:42.063

01:47:43.260 --> 01:47:43.860
<v Speaker 1>Ari,</v>

4091
01:47:43.860 --> 01:47:45.150
<v Speaker 1>I look like I'm the guy in the front.</v>

4092
01:47:45.210 --> 01:47:48.420
<v Speaker 1>You're so uncomfortable putting up a picture that's kind of drawn in the same</v>

4093
01:47:48.421 --> 01:47:52.950
<v Speaker 1>way as the instructions that are in planes telling you where the exits are.</v>

4094
01:47:52.951 --> 01:47:56.130
<v Speaker 1>But it's a guy very uncomfortable with the seat and getting seats.</v>

4095
01:47:56.220 --> 01:47:57.270
<v Speaker 1>His knees smashed.</v>

4096
01:47:57.480 --> 01:47:59.400

<v Speaker 1>I put it in there a little bit.</v>

4098
01:48:05.340 --> 01:48:06.510
<v Speaker 1>That would be very,</v>

4099
01:48:06.511 --> 01:48:07.344
<v Speaker 1>very rude.</v>

4100
01:48:07.380 --> 01:48:09.930
<v Speaker 1>It would be a violation of it is fucking rude though.</v>

4101
01:48:09.931 --> 01:48:12.420
<v Speaker 1>How they shoved so many goddamn seats onto a point.</v>

4106
01:48:18.001 --> 01:48:19.620
<v Speaker 1>As they tempt you at the airport,</v>

4107
01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:20.491
<v Speaker 1>at the airport,</v>

4108
01:48:20.491 --> 01:48:23.490
<v Speaker 1>you get to sit in those seats waiting to get on the plane and those are,</v>

4109
01:48:23.491 --> 01:48:24.310

<v Speaker 1>We forgot what size it is.</v>

4128
01:48:43.201 --> 01:48:44.100
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna make them half that size.</v>

4129
01:48:44.101 --> 01:48:44.490
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4130
01:48:44.490 --> 01:48:45.323
<v Speaker 1>That's okay.</v>

4131
01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:45.901
<v Speaker 1>No it's not.</v>

4132
01:48:45.901 --> 01:48:46.321
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4133
01:48:46.321 --> 01:48:47.154
<v Speaker 1>Asshole.</v>

4134
01:48:47.370 --> 01:48:50.580
<v Speaker 1>Kalin and I were sitting next to each other and I'm not a big guy man,</v>

4135
01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:55.650
<v Speaker 1>but I'm touching the airplane on my left side and touching him on my right side.</v>

4136
01:48:55.680 --> 01:48:57.870
<v Speaker 1>Can we do three rows of two instead of two rows of three?</v>

4137
01:48:57.960 --> 01:48:58.920
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what it should be.</v>

4138
01:48:59.220 --> 01:48:59.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4139
01:48:59.550 --> 01:49:00.990
<v Speaker 1>Just make it tighter to get it around.</v>

4140
01:49:00.991 --> 01:49:05.010
<v Speaker 1>But it should be rows of two and it should be more space in between the rows,</v>

4141
01:49:05.340 --> 01:49:05.641
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4142
01:49:05.641 --> 01:49:06.400
<v Speaker 1>and it,</v>

4143
01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:07.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4144
01:49:07.290 --> 01:49:10.830
<v Speaker 1>I guess you have to pay a little bit more for that and people don't want to do</v>

4145
01:49:10.831 --> 01:49:11.161
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

4146
01:49:11.161 --> 01:49:11.761
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>

4147
01:49:11.761 --> 01:49:13.410
<v Speaker 1>I just feel like the way they're doing it now,</v>

4148
01:49:13.411 --> 01:49:14.040
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>

4149
01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:16.260
<v Speaker 1>it's so Cadillac sucky beds,</v>

4150
01:49:16.261 --> 01:49:17.400
<v Speaker 1>like bunk beds style.</v>

4151
01:49:17.401 --> 01:49:19.110
<v Speaker 1>It should be people on top of people.</v>

4152
01:49:19.111 --> 01:49:22.440
<v Speaker 1>So like you're kind of laying down and like a bunch of shit.</v>

4153
01:49:22.500 --> 01:49:25.770
<v Speaker 1>I want to be old people couldn't hold people down the bottle.</v>

4154
01:49:25.771 --> 01:49:27.570
<v Speaker 1>Some old people can barely stand up.</v>

4155
01:49:27.990 --> 01:49:31.530
<v Speaker 1>The old feel of the seats can't crawl out and just have a bunch of beds in the</v>

4156
01:49:31.531 --> 01:49:32.280
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's another problem.</v>

4160
01:49:35.100 --> 01:49:36.070
<v Speaker 1>That's not a problem.</v>

4161
01:49:36.750 --> 01:49:37.620
<v Speaker 1>That's living your life</v>

4162
01:49:39.230 --> 01:49:40.780
<v Speaker 1>won't be allowed to Hug Scott.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

4169
01:49:50.140 --> 01:49:51.520
<v Speaker 1>but that's not good for society.</v>

4170
01:49:52.160 --> 01:49:52.850
<v Speaker 1>Have you reflect on it?</v>

4171
01:49:52.850 --> 01:49:55.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to have jerked off an airplane</v>

01:51:43.271 --> 01:51:44.710
<v Speaker 1>That's not a rotisserie right now.</v>

4242
01:51:49.031 --> 01:51:51.820
<v Speaker 1>people just on the sides and glaze them up.</v>

4243
01:51:54.080 --> 01:51:59.080
<v Speaker 1>Imagine the scenarios that were gay before you knew what gay was or were aware</v>

4244
01:51:59.651 --> 01:52:00.910
<v Speaker 1>that it was actually going to be around.</v>

4245
01:52:01.030 --> 01:52:01.511
<v Speaker 1>I was around,</v>

4246
01:52:01.511 --> 01:52:03.400
<v Speaker 1>I knew what gay was really young.</v>

4247
01:52:04.690 --> 01:52:05.920
<v Speaker 1>I moved to San Francisco,</v>

4248
01:52:05.960 --> 01:52:07.330
<v Speaker 1>a family did when I was seven,</v>

4249
01:52:07.331 --> 01:52:11.770
<v Speaker 1>my and our next door neighbors were gay and my aunt used to go next door and</v>

4250
01:52:11.771 --> 01:52:13.390
<v Speaker 1>smoke weed with them and get naked with them.</v>

4251
01:52:13.420 --> 01:52:14.410
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

4252
01:52:14.411 --> 01:52:15.221
<v Speaker 1>because they were gay,</v>

4253
01:52:15.221 --> 01:52:15.551
<v Speaker 1>they didn't,</v>

4254
01:52:15.551 --> 01:52:16.900
<v Speaker 1>they didn't want to have nothing to do with her.</v>

4255
01:52:17.050 --> 01:52:17.980
<v Speaker 1>So she would take off,</v>

4256
01:52:18.010 --> 01:52:19.180
<v Speaker 1>they would all take off all their clothes,</v>

4257
01:52:19.181 --> 01:52:21.370
<v Speaker 1>they would get high together and they would all play Bongo.</v>

4258
01:52:21.760 --> 01:52:22.720
<v Speaker 1>And I was like seven,</v>

4259
01:52:23.170 --> 01:52:23.501
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

4260
01:52:23.501 --> 01:52:25.770
<v Speaker 1>And I remember it like they were like really friendly there.</v>

4261
01:52:25.780 --> 01:52:26.830
<v Speaker 1>They weren't creepy at all.</v>

4262
01:52:26.831 --> 01:52:27.581
<v Speaker 1>They were very nice.</v>

4263
01:52:27.581 --> 01:52:28.600
<v Speaker 1>They were very nice neighbors.</v>

4264
01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:28.781
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4265
01:52:28.781 --> 01:52:29.680
<v Speaker 1>they were very nice people.</v>

4266
01:52:29.700 --> 01:52:30.190
<v Speaker 1>That's cool.</v>

4267
01:52:30.190 --> 01:52:32.110
<v Speaker 1>And so my earliest,</v>

4268
01:52:32.111 --> 01:52:32.944
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

4269
01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:36.130
<v Speaker 1>my earliest encounters with gay people was very positive.</v>

4270
01:52:36.131 --> 01:52:37.240
<v Speaker 1>It was like our neighbors were gay.</v>

4271
01:52:37.720 --> 01:52:39.430
<v Speaker 1>Really Nice guys and the whole neighborhood was,</v>

<v Speaker 1>San Francisco was really fucking gays in the 70s.</v>

4276
01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:48.920

4277
01:52:48.921 --> 01:52:51.080
<v Speaker 1>There was always a lot of Asians was.</v>

4278
01:52:51.081 --> 01:52:51.530
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

4279
01:52:51.530 --> 01:52:54.620
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting how places back then like,</v>

4280
01:52:55.040 --> 01:52:58.290
<v Speaker 1>like there's like places that are just decidedly gay.</v>

01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:54.140

4319
01:53:54.230 --> 01:53:56.540
<v Speaker 1>aggressive and they get turned on by,</v>

01:54:00.621 --> 01:54:02.120
<v Speaker 1>leave violence sort of be heated.</v>

4326
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:04.070
<v Speaker 1>But some women don't and they'll,</v>

4327
01:54:04.160 --> 01:54:07.280
<v Speaker 1>the blonde one thing is the women will never totally understand it because</v>

4328
01:54:07.281 --> 01:54:08.100
<v Speaker 1>they're not a woman.</v>

4329
01:54:08.100 --> 01:54:10.460
<v Speaker 1>Just like a man's never going to totally understand what it's like to be</v>

4330
01:54:10.461 --> 01:54:11.260
<v Speaker 1>pregnant.</v>

4331
01:54:11.260 --> 01:54:15.360
<v Speaker 1>Never be able to wrap your head around wanting a baby to grow inside you or</v>

4332
01:54:15.390 --> 01:54:17.630
<v Speaker 1>wanting a dick in your mouth or in your pussy.</v>

4333
01:54:17.631 --> 01:54:17.870
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

4334
01:54:17.870 --> 01:54:18.201
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

4335
01:54:18.201 --> 01:54:18.531
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

4336
01:54:18.531 --> 01:54:19.910
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to have to wrap your head around that.</v>

4337
01:54:19.911 --> 01:54:20.750
<v Speaker 1>You're not a woman.</v>

4338
01:54:21.260 --> 01:54:25.100
<v Speaker 1>And I think the gay guys have going for them is their fucking men.</v>

4339
01:54:25.130 --> 01:54:26.090
<v Speaker 1>They understand what it's,</v>

4340
01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:27.141
<v Speaker 1>what it's like to be a man.</v>

4341
01:54:27.141 --> 01:54:28.550
<v Speaker 1>There's no confusion there.</v>

4342
01:54:28.551 --> 01:54:30.500
<v Speaker 1>Turned on by men and they are men.</v>

4343
01:54:31.010 --> 01:54:33.350
<v Speaker 1>So it's like everybody knows what the fuck is up.</v>

4344
01:54:33.950 --> 01:54:37.880
<v Speaker 1>Whereas it's not like this charade that you have to play when you're trying to</v>

4345
01:54:37.881 --> 01:54:38.421
<v Speaker 1>get a girl to,</v>

4346
01:54:38.421 --> 01:54:42.050
<v Speaker 1>like you have to ask for like a Bj or something and he looks at it.</v>

4347
01:54:42.860 --> 01:54:43.910
<v Speaker 1>If that was a man there,</v>

4348
01:54:43.911 --> 01:54:44.390
<v Speaker 1>he'd be like,</v>

4349
01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:44.481
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

01:54:45.701 --> 01:54:46.580
<v Speaker 1>I can get you to bed.</v>

4354
01:54:46.640 --> 01:54:47.473
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4355
01:54:47.720 --> 01:54:47.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4356
01:54:47.990 --> 01:54:48.351
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4357
01:54:48.351 --> 01:54:51.110
<v Speaker 1>unless he was a greedy bitch didn't want to blow you,</v>

4359
01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:54.080

4360
01:54:54.081 --> 01:54:55.790
<v Speaker 1>that happens in a lot of gay relationships.</v>

4361
01:54:56.000 --> 01:54:56.541
<v Speaker 1>This is weird.</v>

4377
01:55:17.630 --> 01:55:18.391
<v Speaker 1>I should have mentioned it.</v>

4378
01:55:18.391 --> 01:55:19.520
<v Speaker 1>The freeze dried foods.</v>

4379
01:55:19.521 --> 01:55:20.600
<v Speaker 1>Once you had the hot water,</v>

4380
01:55:21.590 --> 01:55:22.490
<v Speaker 1>it all pops out.</v>

4381
01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:22.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4382
01:55:22.790 --> 01:55:23.410
<v Speaker 1>Let the party,</v>

4383
01:55:23.410 --> 01:55:24.770
<v Speaker 1>the like the fucking uh,</v>

4384
01:55:24.950 --> 01:55:25.783
<v Speaker 1>Peter Pan.</v>

4385
01:55:26.290 --> 01:55:27.650
<v Speaker 1>What was every out of water through it.</v>

4386
01:55:28.170 --> 01:55:28.911
<v Speaker 1>What movie was that?</v>

4387
01:55:28.911 --> 01:55:30.200
<v Speaker 1>It was some fantastical movie.</v>

4388
01:55:30.510 --> 01:55:30.920
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

4389
01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:33.710
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting that people have a problem with gay people.</v>

4390
01:55:34.280 --> 01:55:35.750
<v Speaker 1>It's interesting that people,</v>

4391
01:55:35.780 --> 01:55:39.170
<v Speaker 1>I think they worry about gay people being pedophiles.</v>

4392
01:55:39.410 --> 01:55:42.650
<v Speaker 1>There's a big difference between being a pedophile and being gay and there's a</v>

4393
01:55:42.651 --> 01:55:43.880
<v Speaker 1>lot of gay people that want them.</v>

4394
01:55:43.881 --> 01:55:45.270
<v Speaker 1>Nothing to do with the young guys.</v>

4395
01:55:45.271 --> 01:55:47.700
<v Speaker 1>In fact like I want to Brian Collins friends,</v>

4396
01:55:47.770 --> 01:55:51.690
<v Speaker 1>it was a gay guy and he was attracted to guys like John Mccain's age.</v>

4397
01:55:51.990 --> 01:55:53.790
<v Speaker 1>He's attracted like older business.</v>

4398
01:55:53.791 --> 01:55:55.470
<v Speaker 1>My friend Rachel send to girls that are older.</v>

4399
01:55:55.471 --> 01:55:56.280
<v Speaker 1>She was like,</v>

4400
01:55:56.280 --> 01:55:56.491
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

4401
01:55:56.491 --> 01:55:57.570
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking this 52 year old.</v>

4402
01:55:57.571 --> 01:55:58.150
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

4403
01:55:58.150 --> 01:55:58.470
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

4404
01:55:58.470 --> 01:55:59.303
<v Speaker 1>Rachel.</v>

4405
01:56:01.020 --> 01:56:03.450
<v Speaker 1>But then I realized the 52 year old just getting a younger chick,</v>

4406
01:56:04.620 --> 01:56:08.900
<v Speaker 1>maybe she likes it because she takes care of her or something and shit.</v>

4407
01:56:09.360 --> 01:56:09.960
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

4408
01:56:09.960 --> 01:56:10.441
<v Speaker 1>shut up.</v>

4409
01:56:10.441 --> 01:56:10.760
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

4410
01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:11.141
<v Speaker 1>is it,</v>

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

4492
01:58:51.731 --> 01:58:55.630
<v Speaker 1>sex is such a weird thing because it's all just about what feels good to your</v>

4493
01:58:55.631 --> 01:58:56.290
<v Speaker 1>body.</v>

4495
01:58:57.460 --> 01:59:01.120
<v Speaker 1>It's about people doing things to each other's body that makes them feel good,</v>

4496
01:59:01.270 --> 01:59:03.190
<v Speaker 1>but they're so negative connotations.</v>

4497
01:59:03.191 --> 01:59:03.701
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

4498

4512
01:59:26.141 --> 01:59:26.860
<v Speaker 1>1300 people.</v>

4513
01:59:26.860 --> 01:59:27.020
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

01:59:27.020 --> 01:59:27.341
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

4515
01:59:27.341 --> 01:59:28.340
<v Speaker 1>I know some other kind of retail.</v>

4516
01:59:28.800 --> 01:59:29.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

01:59:29.410 --> 01:59:31.220

4518
01:59:31.700 --> 01:59:33.400
<v Speaker 1>I just got it.</v>

4519
01:59:33.430 --> 01:59:34.150
<v Speaker 1>Just got it.</v>

4520
01:59:34.150 --> 01:59:34.391
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

4521
01:59:34.391 --> 01:59:35.410
<v Speaker 1>we're shocked with crabs.</v>

4522
01:59:35.411 --> 01:59:37.420
<v Speaker 1>Like I never was crabs anymore.</v>

4523
01:59:39.430 --> 01:59:44.430
<v Speaker 1>According August nine 2012 they approximately 340 case of gonorrhea each year.</v>

4524
01:59:44.710 --> 01:59:47.320
<v Speaker 1>A hundred 300,003 in America.</v>

4525
01:59:48.100 --> 01:59:48.551
<v Speaker 1>In America.</v>

4526
01:59:48.551 --> 01:59:49.384
<v Speaker 1>I was right.</v>

4527
01:59:49.420 --> 01:59:49.870
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

4528
01:59:49.870 --> 01:59:52.450
<v Speaker 1>That was gonna be one that comes back and it gets cured or is that the one that</v>

4529
01:59:52.451 --> 01:59:53.284
<v Speaker 1>you can forever?</v>

4530
01:59:53.410 --> 01:59:53.621
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4531
01:59:53.621 --> 01:59:54.280
<v Speaker 1>you cure it.</v>

4532
01:59:54.280 --> 01:59:56.050
<v Speaker 1>You get a little shot of penicillin.</v>

4533
01:59:56.500 --> 01:59:59.140
<v Speaker 1>That's the one he didn't border like empire with the shoe thing up your dick</v>

4534
01:59:59.141 --> 02:00:00.340
<v Speaker 1>hole and pull up strain.</v>

4535
02:00:00.680 --> 02:00:02.200
<v Speaker 1>So let's stop and think about that.</v>

4536
02:00:02.201 --> 02:00:04.510
<v Speaker 1>There's probably a lot of money and treating gonorrhea.</v>

4537
02:00:04.511 --> 02:00:05.890
<v Speaker 1>I think about the amount of money.</v>

4538
02:00:06.680 --> 02:00:11.680
<v Speaker 1>What if we found out like the medicine responsible for treating gonorrhea was</v>

4539
02:00:12.281 --> 02:00:14.400
<v Speaker 1>also responsible for commercials.</v>

4540
02:00:14.401 --> 02:00:16.010
<v Speaker 1>It shows chicks acting like whores.</v>

4541
02:00:17.450 --> 02:00:19.360
<v Speaker 1>Like he thought they were selling Nike's,</v>

4542
02:00:19.570 --> 02:00:23.260
<v Speaker 1>but really they're selling pussy because it's partially sponsored by the</v>

4543
02:00:23.410 --> 02:00:26.140
<v Speaker 1>gonorrhea medication that is trying to get them going.</v>

4544
02:00:26.141 --> 02:00:26.440
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4545
02:00:26.440 --> 02:00:29.500
<v Speaker 1>like gonorrhea mercenaries and they'd go out there,</v>

4546
02:00:29.530 --> 02:00:32.620
<v Speaker 1>they give them gonorrhea and then there's like the guys that are studs,</v>

4547
02:00:32.621 --> 02:00:37.130
<v Speaker 1>they just got to fuck a lot of bitches and they create like a hole in festal</v>

4548
02:00:37.140 --> 02:00:38.300
<v Speaker 1>hold town with gonorrhea.</v>

4549
02:00:38.300 --> 02:00:41.920
<v Speaker 1>Just so they can sell or trying to sell people to stop smoking so it can chew</v>

4550
02:00:41.921 --> 02:00:42.420
<v Speaker 1>gum.</v>

4551
02:00:42.420 --> 02:00:44.260

02:04:17.130 --> 02:04:20.930
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be able to upload all the shows live on youtube as well now and</v>

4704

<v Speaker 1>we'll be able to a stream them on youtube.</v>

4705
02:04:23.301 --> 02:04:24.410
<v Speaker 1>We've got a new thing going on.</v>

02:04:24.830 --> 02:04:26.260
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be able to live in u street.</v>

4707
02:04:26.290 --> 02:04:26.431
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4708
02:04:26.431 --> 02:04:26.521
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

4709
02:04:26.521 --> 02:04:26.631
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

4710
02:04:26.631 --> 02:04:27.620
<v Speaker 1>We're going to do at the same time.</v>

4711
02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Simultaneous,</v>

4712
02:04:29.331 --> 02:04:30.440
<v Speaker 1>simultaneous.</v>

4713
02:04:30.560 --> 02:04:31.250
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

4714
02:04:31.250 --> 02:04:31.761
<v Speaker 1>That's possible,</v>

4715
02:04:31.761 --> 02:04:32.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

4716
02:04:32.320 --> 02:04:32.940
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4717
02:04:32.940 --> 02:04:33.773
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4718
02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:36.680
<v Speaker 1>two feeds to video feeds and get some hardcore bandwidth.</v>

4719
02:04:36.740 --> 02:04:37.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4720
02:04:37.290 --> 02:04:37.700
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

4721
02:04:37.700 --> 02:04:38.050
<v Speaker 1>we're going to</v>

4722
02:04:38.050 --> 02:04:40.230
<v Speaker 4>get the guests to computers or something.</v>

4723
02:04:41.010 --> 02:04:41.371
<v Speaker 4>I Dunno.</v>

4724
02:04:41.371 --> 02:04:42.204
<v Speaker 4>That's kind of tricky.</v>

4725
02:04:42.260 --> 02:04:45.210
<v Speaker 4>Let's see if we can try it because otherwise we can at least upload them.</v>

4726
02:04:45.211 --> 02:04:47.190
<v Speaker 4>We can start uploading them to use youtube.</v>

4727
02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:47.821
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4728
02:04:47.821 --> 02:04:51.600
<v Speaker 4>I did prom might have with youtube is that I've always tried to do the live</v>

4729
02:04:51.601 --> 02:04:52.980
<v Speaker 4>streaming thing or you know,</v>

4730
02:04:53.010 --> 02:04:53.701
<v Speaker 4>and it never,</v>

4731
02:04:53.701 --> 02:04:55.050
<v Speaker 4>it always never works.</v>

4732
02:04:55.051 --> 02:04:55.680
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

4733
02:04:55.680 --> 02:04:57.900
<v Speaker 4>Crashes or maybe we could try it.</v>

4734
02:04:58.260 --> 02:04:58.820
<v Speaker 4>We'll try it.</v>

4735
02:04:58.820 --> 02:04:59.653
<v Speaker 4>We'll see what's up.</v>

4736
02:04:59.830 --> 02:05:01.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what my Internet's like at the new place.</v>

4737
02:05:02.080 --> 02:05:02.401
<v Speaker 2>Will suit,</v>

4738
02:05:02.401 --> 02:05:04.890
<v Speaker 2>won't see until they're putting the bricks on the walls.</v>

4739
02:05:04.900 --> 02:05:08.830
<v Speaker 2>This week I'm making it fancy folks making it like a Billy Joel's Italian</v>

4740
02:05:08.831 --> 02:05:09.310
<v Speaker 2>restaurant.</v>

4741
02:05:09.310 --> 02:05:10.000
<v Speaker 2>That's the thing.</v>

4742
02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:13.080
<v Speaker 2>Vytorin embattled white,</v>

4743
02:05:13.870 --> 02:05:15.290
<v Speaker 2>whatever kind of moon.</v>

4744
02:05:17.760 --> 02:05:18.190
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4745
02:05:18.190 --> 02:05:18.401
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4746
02:05:18.401 --> 02:05:21.040
<v Speaker 2>I just thought that they can get bricks.</v>

4747
02:05:21.060 --> 02:05:21.160
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

4748
02:05:21.160 --> 02:05:21.640
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

4749
02:05:21.640 --> 02:05:23.680
<v Speaker 2>the reason there's two reasons for putting bricks in the wall.</v>

4750
02:05:23.860 --> 02:05:26.680
<v Speaker 2>The number one reason is to Joey Diaz the room at the fuck.</v>

4751
02:05:26.860 --> 02:05:27.350
<v Speaker 2>I got a joy.</v>

4752
02:05:27.350 --> 02:05:28.660
<v Speaker 2>D has proved his cock sucker.</v>

4753
02:05:29.110 --> 02:05:29.561
<v Speaker 2>The uh,</v>

4754
02:05:29.561 --> 02:05:29.891
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4755
02:05:29.891 --> 02:05:33.310
<v Speaker 2>there's a business next door and I don't want Joey screaming through the walls.</v>

4756
02:05:33.311 --> 02:05:35.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it would show up,</v>

4757
02:05:35.590 --> 02:05:35.831
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

4758
02:05:35.831 --> 02:05:36.271
<v Speaker 2>so I'm,</v>

4759
02:05:36.271 --> 02:05:38.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm taking significant steps to what deaden the,</v>

4760
02:05:38.890 --> 02:05:40.390
<v Speaker 2>some of the sound in the room.</v>

4761
02:05:40.600 --> 02:05:42.430
<v Speaker 2>And one of them is to put up a brick wall.</v>

4762
02:05:43.220 --> 02:05:43.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4763
02:05:43.650 --> 02:05:44.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean super.</v>

4764
02:05:44.290 --> 02:05:48.040
<v Speaker 2>It's just get a big bubble when the bubble boy bubbles for Joey Diaz and just</v>

4765
02:05:48.041 --> 02:05:49.690
<v Speaker 2>have him walk around like a hamster anyway.</v>

4766
02:05:50.340 --> 02:05:53.140
<v Speaker 2>Plastic and just going for it.</v>

4767
02:05:53.250 --> 02:05:53.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4768
02:05:53.480 --> 02:05:54.130
<v Speaker 2>I'm a,</v>

4769
02:05:54.130 --> 02:05:58.570
<v Speaker 2>they take bricks that they like wreck a building and they take bricks and they</v>

4770
02:05:58.571 --> 02:06:01.750
<v Speaker 2>sliced the veneer off the brick and then they could put that on a regular wall</v>

4771
02:06:01.840 --> 02:06:03.850
<v Speaker 2>so it adds like another wall layer,</v>

4772
02:06:03.880 --> 02:06:04.480
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

4773
02:06:04.480 --> 02:06:08.110
<v Speaker 2>So I figured that would be a pretty good to prevent some sound.</v>

4774
02:06:08.111 --> 02:06:11.350
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm also got these curtains that are going up that have like a sound</v>

4775
02:06:11.380 --> 02:06:14.500
<v Speaker 2>deadening backing to them putting those up as well.</v>

4776
02:06:15.010 --> 02:06:15.431
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4777
02:06:15.431 --> 02:06:16.720
<v Speaker 2>And a I just taken,</v>

4778
02:06:16.721 --> 02:06:17.980
<v Speaker 2>it's taken some time folks,</v>

4779
02:06:17.981 --> 02:06:20.680
<v Speaker 2>but it's because I'm doing it while I'm doing all these other things.</v>

4780
02:06:20.681 --> 02:06:21.514
<v Speaker 2>At the same time,</v>

4781
02:06:21.760 --> 02:06:22.130
<v Speaker 2>if you're,</v>

4782
02:06:22.130 --> 02:06:25.000
<v Speaker 2>the customer over under this week is going to be the bricks that we'd done.</v>

4783
02:06:25.000 --> 02:06:25.900
<v Speaker 2>The desk is done.</v>

4784
02:06:25.901 --> 02:06:27.700
<v Speaker 2>So I have all the equipment in.</v>

4785
02:06:27.701 --> 02:06:28.420
<v Speaker 2>So not,</v>

4786
02:06:28.420 --> 02:06:29.200
<v Speaker 2>not that bad.</v>

4787
02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:30.220
<v Speaker 2>Once the uh,</v>

4788
02:06:30.610 --> 02:06:32.560
<v Speaker 2>once the bricks are up on the wall and uh,</v>

4789
02:06:32.561 --> 02:06:33.670
<v Speaker 2>I got the wall painted.</v>

4790
02:06:34.620 --> 02:06:35.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4791
02:06:35.200 --> 02:06:35.801
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

4792
02:06:35.801 --> 02:06:36.551
<v Speaker 2>I think in December,</v>

4793
02:06:36.551 --> 02:06:40.150
<v Speaker 2>I think my goal is before we do the end of the world show with honey,</v>

4794
02:06:40.151 --> 02:06:45.151
<v Speaker 2>honey and Diaz and Stan hope that we do a podcast like the night before that</v>

4795
02:06:46.241 --> 02:06:51.241
<v Speaker 2>would be my goal is to open up the studio that week and do a do a podcast there</v>

4796
02:06:51.341 --> 02:06:52.174
<v Speaker 2>the night before.</v>

4797
02:06:52.720 --> 02:06:53.860
<v Speaker 2>But once we have it,</v>

4798
02:06:53.890 --> 02:06:55.240
<v Speaker 2>once we have an up and running,</v>

4799
02:06:55.360 --> 02:06:56.230
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be,</v>

4800
02:06:56.260 --> 02:06:56.530
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4801
02:06:56.530 --> 02:06:57.220
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

4802
02:06:57.220 --> 02:07:02.220
<v Speaker 2>I just want to get a place that's going to be a place that we can kind of</v>

4803
02:07:02.500 --> 02:07:07.500
<v Speaker 2>completely control the environment and make it like as cool inside as I can,</v>

4804
02:07:08.680 --> 02:07:09.041
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4805
02:07:09.041 --> 02:07:11.890
<v Speaker 2>set it up as technologically perfect,</v>

4806
02:07:11.891 --> 02:07:12.730
<v Speaker 2>technically perfect,</v>

4807
02:07:13.120 --> 02:07:14.750
<v Speaker 2>really nice big desk and,</v>

4808
02:07:15.850 --> 02:07:17.990
<v Speaker 2>and have it a fairly close to,</v>

4809
02:07:17.991 --> 02:07:18.400
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4810
02:07:18.400 --> 02:07:20.830
<v Speaker 2>this place has really become fucking high tech.</v>

4811
02:07:21.110 --> 02:07:21.411
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4812
02:07:21.411 --> 02:07:22.360
<v Speaker 2>not the core.</v>

4813
02:07:22.361 --> 02:07:23.130
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's really,</v>

4814
02:07:23.130 --> 02:07:25.870
<v Speaker 2>it's like this is inside Brian's brain.</v>

4815
02:07:27.030 --> 02:07:30.580
<v Speaker 2>If you could open up his brain with a can opener that Hitler Zombie would pop</v>

4816
02:07:30.581 --> 02:07:31.414

02:11:28.570 --> 02:11:28.841
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

4982
02:11:28.841 --> 02:11:29.621
<v Speaker 3>super strong,</v>

4983
02:11:29.621 --> 02:11:30.454
<v Speaker 3>great flavor.</v>

4984
02:11:30.550 --> 02:11:33.520
<v Speaker 3>This can be fermented to all hell and extra for this down my throat.</v>

4985
02:11:33.521 --> 02:11:35.200
<v Speaker 3>And you'll see it just burn right through my desk.</v>

4986
02:11:35.201 --> 02:11:36.310
<v Speaker 3>Squad shirt right here.</v>

4987
02:11:38.020 --> 02:11:38.853
<v Speaker 1>I really are.</v>

4988
02:11:38.870 --> 02:11:40.530
<v Speaker 1>We watching a guy just drinking soda?</v>

4989
02:11:40.580 --> 02:11:40.761
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

4990
02:11:40.761 --> 02:11:42.450
<v Speaker 1>but it's like from the 19,</v>

4991
02:11:42.510 --> 02:11:43.710
<v Speaker 1>1947.</v>

4992
02:11:46.840 --> 02:11:47.530
<v Speaker 3>All right.</v>

4993
02:11:47.530 --> 02:11:50.710
<v Speaker 3>Your tastes like grape flavor,</v>

4994
02:11:51.010 --> 02:11:52.570
<v Speaker 3>like nasty pond water.</v>

4995
02:11:53.650 --> 02:11:54.483
<v Speaker 3>It's a,</v>

4996
02:11:54.730 --> 02:11:55.563
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

4997
02:11:56.150 --> 02:11:57.520
<v Speaker 3>That really wasn't that interesting.</v>

4998
02:11:58.020 --> 02:11:58.853
<v Speaker 1>Just thought it was weird.</v>

4999
02:11:58.880 --> 02:11:59.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5000
02:11:59.370 --> 02:12:01.570
<v Speaker 1>what would you do that I just,</v>

5001
02:12:01.580 --> 02:12:03.570
<v Speaker 1>I drank a bottle of coke zero coke original.</v>

5002
02:12:04.330 --> 02:12:06.050
<v Speaker 1>How these three of them save from uh,</v>

5003
02:12:06.080 --> 02:12:06.741
<v Speaker 1>when I was little,</v>

5004
02:12:06.741 --> 02:12:08.130
<v Speaker 1>little really real.</v>

5005
02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:09.433
<v Speaker 1>What it tastes like.</v>

5006
02:12:09.470 --> 02:12:11.360
<v Speaker 1>Super flat coke,</v>

5007
02:12:11.361 --> 02:12:11.991
<v Speaker 1>super flat coke.</v>

5008
02:12:11.991 --> 02:12:12.824
<v Speaker 1>Pretty much coke.</v>

5009
02:12:12.860 --> 02:12:14.480
<v Speaker 1>He ends up puking and slightly off,</v>

5010
02:12:14.481 --> 02:12:16.110
<v Speaker 1>but not much muck cars.</v>

5011
02:12:16.370 --> 02:12:16.910
<v Speaker 1>Does he really?</v>

5012
02:12:16.910 --> 02:12:17.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5013
02:12:17.211 --> 02:12:17.961
<v Speaker 1>he sends up because of it.</v>

5014
02:12:17.961 --> 02:12:18.890
<v Speaker 1>It's just silly bitch.</v>

5015
02:12:18.910 --> 02:12:21.400
<v Speaker 1>And that's why you drink that?</v>

5016
02:12:21.740 --> 02:12:21.921
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5017
02:12:21.921 --> 02:12:24.830
<v Speaker 1>I don't understand what people would like think that it's interesting to drink</v>

5018
02:12:24.831 --> 02:12:26.590
<v Speaker 1>something gross that's been around for a little bit.</v>

5019
02:12:26.680 --> 02:12:26.870
<v Speaker 1>Probably.</v>

5020
02:12:26.870 --> 02:12:28.040
<v Speaker 1>If you look at last that long,</v>

5021
02:12:28.041 --> 02:12:29.030
<v Speaker 1>like a wine then sure,</v>

5022
02:12:29.031 --> 02:12:29.570
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

5023
02:12:29.570 --> 02:12:31.430
<v Speaker 1>But if it can't last that long and what are you doing?</v>

5024
02:12:31.440 --> 02:12:32.120
<v Speaker 1>It's gone.</v>

5025
02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:32.930
<v Speaker 1>It's gone rotten.</v>

5026
02:12:32.930 --> 02:12:34.570
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird thing that people do with ones,</v>

5027
02:12:34.610 --> 02:12:35.030
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5028
02:12:35.030 --> 02:12:37.760
<v Speaker 1>keep wines around for hundreds of years and drink them or scotch.</v>

5029
02:12:37.760 --> 02:12:38.241
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>

5030
02:12:38.241 --> 02:12:39.380
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like hoarding behavior.</v>

5031
02:12:40.210 --> 02:12:41.420
<v Speaker 1>That's like there's only a few left.</v>

5032
02:12:41.440 --> 02:12:43.400
<v Speaker 1>Just don't gotta wait.</v>

5033
02:12:43.850 --> 02:12:44.091
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5034
02:12:44.091 --> 02:12:45.290
<v Speaker 1>That's what I do with weeds now.</v>

5035
02:12:45.680 --> 02:12:48.200
<v Speaker 1>I'll have like a few different strains of weed and if it would be good,</v>

5036
02:12:48.201 --> 02:12:49.610
<v Speaker 1>I've got through half of it right away and they'll be like,</v>

5037
02:12:49.640 --> 02:12:49.851
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

5038
02:12:49.851 --> 02:12:51.050
<v Speaker 1>we only have like half of it left.</v>

5039
02:12:51.250 --> 02:12:52.610
<v Speaker 1>It's when it gets like slower,</v>

5040
02:12:52.640 --> 02:12:55.260
<v Speaker 1>but I use it and then I only go back to it every couple of months.</v>

5041
02:12:55.290 --> 02:12:59.090
<v Speaker 1>You hoard it like the last of the Maui Wowie let's just slow it down a little.</v>

5042
02:12:59.150 --> 02:13:00.620
<v Speaker 1>What would you do that we need to just get more.</v>

5043
02:13:00.730 --> 02:13:01.150
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

5044
02:13:01.150 --> 02:13:02.180
<v Speaker 1>I always sort of forget.</v>

5045
02:13:02.220 --> 02:13:03.080
<v Speaker 1>I can go get more.</v>

5046
02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:04.310
<v Speaker 1>I don't want it to be gone.</v>

5047
02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:06.260
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem with living in parts of the country.</v>

5048
02:13:06.261 --> 02:13:07.370
<v Speaker 1>That's not like California.</v>

5049
02:13:07.910 --> 02:13:12.140
<v Speaker 1>The world really would change if the rest of the country was like Colorado and</v>

5050
02:13:12.141 --> 02:13:12.950
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>

5051
02:13:12.950 --> 02:13:15.170
<v Speaker 1>Those are the two places where you can get weed anywhere.</v>

5052
02:13:15.200 --> 02:13:16.910
<v Speaker 1>Did they not shut down dispensaries in Colorado?</v>

5053
02:13:16.970 --> 02:13:17.760
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

5054
02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:18.593
<v Speaker 1>Only only here.</v>

5055
02:13:18.890 --> 02:13:19.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

5056
02:13:19.240 --> 02:13:20.510
<v Speaker 1>they shut them down a lot more here.</v>

5057
02:13:20.780 --> 02:13:23.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they have shut down some of them in Colorado,</v>

5058
02:13:23.210 --> 02:13:26.060
<v Speaker 1>we're a lot more of like on the radar there.</v>

5059
02:13:26.061 --> 02:13:26.480
<v Speaker 1>Atlanta,</v>

5060
02:13:26.480 --> 02:13:28.130
<v Speaker 1>they're on the radar and Colorado man,</v>

5061
02:13:28.131 --> 02:13:30.140
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of people focal point to us here.</v>

5062
02:13:30.170 --> 02:13:31.890
<v Speaker 1>But the accepted,</v>

5063
02:13:31.891 --> 02:13:32.010
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

5064
02:13:32.010 --> 02:13:35.910
<v Speaker 2>I think it's more accepted by the people in Colorado than it is the people of</v>

5065
02:13:35.911 --> 02:13:36.720
<v Speaker 2>La,</v>

5066
02:13:36.720 --> 02:13:37.650
<v Speaker 2>the people of La,</v>

5067
02:13:37.651 --> 02:13:40.290
<v Speaker 2>this little bit of a battle in Portland.</v>

5068
02:13:40.320 --> 02:13:41.670
<v Speaker 2>It was just everywhere.</v>

5069
02:13:41.790 --> 02:13:42.623
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

5070
02:13:42.770 --> 02:13:44.340
<v Speaker 2>Cause they're all fucking nature boys too.</v>

5071
02:13:44.341 --> 02:13:45.270
<v Speaker 2>So they'll grow shit.</v>

5072
02:13:45.330 --> 02:13:47.550
<v Speaker 2>It's part of the garden we plant too.</v>

5073
02:13:47.720 --> 02:13:49.080
<v Speaker 2>There's some likes their own weed.</v>

5074
02:13:49.310 --> 02:13:50.010
<v Speaker 2>It's smart,</v>

5075
02:13:50.010 --> 02:13:51.810
<v Speaker 2>smart places and smart places.</v>

5076
02:13:51.811 --> 02:13:53.010
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm not pro,</v>

5077
02:13:53.100 --> 02:13:56.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm not pro drugs period because some drugs are fucking terrible.</v>

5078
02:13:56.821 --> 02:13:57.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm not pro pills.</v>

5079
02:13:58.050 --> 02:13:58.861
<v Speaker 2>I'm not pro math.</v>

5080
02:13:58.861 --> 02:13:59.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm not pro that.</v>

5081
02:13:59.610 --> 02:14:00.840
<v Speaker 2>But if you're not pro,</v>

5082
02:14:00.841 --> 02:14:03.330
<v Speaker 2>we'd even have to be a fucking idiot if you,</v>

5083
02:14:03.331 --> 02:14:06.090
<v Speaker 2>if you really think that there's something wrong with it and it's bad for</v>

5084
02:14:06.091 --> 02:14:06.924
<v Speaker 2>society,</v>

5085
02:14:06.940 --> 02:14:08.730
<v Speaker 2>you got to be an idiot or you're ignorant.</v>

5086
02:14:08.760 --> 02:14:11.580
<v Speaker 2>You don't understand what's really going on with it because it was really,</v>

5087
02:14:11.970 --> 02:14:13.440
<v Speaker 2>what's really going on is not a bad thing.</v>

5088
02:14:13.470 --> 02:14:13.711
<v Speaker 2>It's a,</v>

5089
02:14:13.711 --> 02:14:15.810
<v Speaker 2>it's a humbling thing that everybody could use.</v>

5090
02:14:15.811 --> 02:14:16.644
<v Speaker 2>A little bit of humbling.</v>

5091
02:14:16.860 --> 02:14:17.101
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

5092
02:14:17.101 --> 02:14:19.590
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be some people that just sit around and smoke pot all day and</v>

5093
02:14:19.591 --> 02:14:20.424
<v Speaker 2>don't get anything done,</v>

5094
02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:25.440
<v Speaker 2>but that's a psychological problem that they have issues that that issue could</v>

5095
02:14:25.441 --> 02:14:29.430
<v Speaker 2>manifest itself that way or it could manifest itself by them being perpetually</v>

5096
02:14:29.431 --> 02:14:30.900
<v Speaker 2>late or it can manifest.</v>

5097
02:14:31.230 --> 02:14:33.060
<v Speaker 2>They could fucking sabotage themselves.</v>

5098
02:14:33.061 --> 02:14:36.990
<v Speaker 2>People have weird issues so they could sabotage themselves with weed or with</v>

5099
02:14:36.991 --> 02:14:38.580
<v Speaker 2>anything else they choose to do it with.</v>

5100
02:14:38.800 --> 02:14:41.310
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean that it can't be used the right way.</v>

5101
02:14:43.300 --> 02:14:46.260
<v Speaker 2>Do you think people are burnouts because of weed or they're just burnout and</v>

5102
02:14:46.261 --> 02:14:47.094
<v Speaker 2>then they would lose?</v>

5103
02:14:47.630 --> 02:14:49.000
<v Speaker 2>I think they are burnouts for weed.</v>

5104
02:14:49.040 --> 02:14:50.160
<v Speaker 2>Weed helps it along too.</v>

5105
02:14:50.220 --> 02:14:50.401
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>

5106
02:14:50.401 --> 02:14:52.800
<v Speaker 2>Anything can help you along if you don't have any resolve,</v>

5107
02:14:53.220 --> 02:14:54.710
<v Speaker 2>if you don't have any fucking disaster,</v>

5108
02:14:55.710 --> 02:14:56.011
<v Speaker 2>shit,</v>

5109
02:14:56.011 --> 02:14:56.844
<v Speaker 2>weed.</v>

5110
02:14:56.940 --> 02:14:57.751
<v Speaker 2>It's a little bit of that.</v>

5111
02:14:57.751 --> 02:14:57.961
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5112
02:14:57.961 --> 02:14:59.040
<v Speaker 2>You smoked that thought of it.</v>

5113
02:14:59.220 --> 02:14:59.830
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

5114
02:14:59.830 --> 02:15:00.663
<v Speaker 2>Come on Dad.</v>

5115
02:15:00.700 --> 02:15:01.860
<v Speaker 2>Chronic dog.</v>

5116
02:15:02.040 --> 02:15:03.780
<v Speaker 2>Some people that just hasn't been had some weight loss,</v>

5117
02:15:03.781 --> 02:15:05.100
<v Speaker 2>so that's true too.</v>

5118
02:15:05.160 --> 02:15:05.461
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5119
02:15:05.461 --> 02:15:07.500
<v Speaker 2>There's some people where every look,</v>

5120
02:15:07.530 --> 02:15:10.070
<v Speaker 2>people get fucking sick if you get the nuts,</v>

5121
02:15:10.170 --> 02:15:11.040
<v Speaker 2>could not get high.</v>

5122
02:15:11.250 --> 02:15:11.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5123
02:15:11.710 --> 02:15:12.543
<v Speaker 2>and then I go,</v>

5124
02:15:12.810 --> 02:15:12.931
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

5125
02:15:12.931 --> 02:15:13.581
<v Speaker 2>I told you about it.</v>

5126
02:15:13.581 --> 02:15:14.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5127
02:15:14.160 --> 02:15:14.401
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5128
02:15:14.401 --> 02:15:15.180
<v Speaker 2>Amazing.</v>

5129
02:15:15.180 --> 02:15:15.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

5130
02:15:15.630 --> 02:15:18.270
<v Speaker 2>I heard that works with Dmt to the certain people that just can't,</v>

5131
02:15:18.300 --> 02:15:19.530
<v Speaker 2>DMT just doesn't work on them.</v>

5132
02:15:19.531 --> 02:15:20.640
<v Speaker 2>Small percentage of people,</v>

5133
02:15:20.641 --> 02:15:24.440
<v Speaker 2>but every now and then I heard somebody went to float lab and she was just like,</v>

5134
02:15:24.450 --> 02:15:24.611
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

5135
02:15:24.611 --> 02:15:25.860
<v Speaker 2>that wasn't really hallucinating.</v>

5136
02:15:25.861 --> 02:15:26.694
<v Speaker 2>It was just like,</v>

5137
02:15:27.020 --> 02:15:27.540
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

5138
02:15:27.540 --> 02:15:28.290
<v Speaker 2>float lab,</v>

5139
02:15:28.290 --> 02:15:29.790
<v Speaker 2>that's tank or whatever.</v>

5140
02:15:29.791 --> 02:15:30.720
<v Speaker 2>That takes some time.</v>

5141
02:15:30.990 --> 02:15:32.130
<v Speaker 2>The float tank is not a,</v>

5142
02:15:32.131 --> 02:15:33.810
<v Speaker 2>it's not like instant hallucinations.</v>

5143
02:15:33.990 --> 02:15:38.850
<v Speaker 2>You got to really get comfortable with letting go and I'm like you finding like</v>

5144
02:15:38.880 --> 02:15:40.020
<v Speaker 2>the center of your thoughts.</v>

5145
02:15:40.440 --> 02:15:41.161
<v Speaker 2>That's not an easy,</v>

5146
02:15:41.161 --> 02:15:42.510
<v Speaker 2>it's easy to distract yourself.</v>

5147
02:15:42.540 --> 02:15:42.721
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

5148
02:15:42.721 --> 02:15:42.950
<v Speaker 2>what's your,</v>

5149
02:15:42.950 --> 02:15:43.800
<v Speaker 2>what would you try to do?</v>

5150
02:15:43.980 --> 02:15:45.570
<v Speaker 2>You got to get strong mentally,</v>

5151
02:15:45.571 --> 02:15:47.820
<v Speaker 2>you have to learn how to meditate.</v>

5152
02:15:48.030 --> 02:15:49.170
<v Speaker 2>When you get into a float tank,</v>

5153
02:15:49.171 --> 02:15:51.870
<v Speaker 2>it's not as simple as you get in there and you start tripping because you get in</v>

5154
02:15:51.871 --> 02:15:51.961
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

5155
02:15:51.961 --> 02:15:52.531
<v Speaker 2>you're still thinking,</v>

5156
02:15:52.531 --> 02:15:52.711
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

5157
02:15:52.711 --> 02:15:52.891
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

5158
02:15:52.891 --> 02:15:53.371
<v Speaker 2>I'm floating.</v>

5159
02:15:53.371 --> 02:15:53.551
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

5160
02:15:53.551 --> 02:15:53.671
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>

5161
02:15:53.671 --> 02:15:54.331
<v Speaker 2>this feels weird.</v>

5162
02:15:54.331 --> 02:15:54.961
<v Speaker 2>Where's the side?</v>

5163
02:15:54.961 --> 02:15:56.130
<v Speaker 2>It's right here on my balls.</v>

5164
02:15:56.131 --> 02:15:56.610
<v Speaker 2>Itch.</v>

5165
02:15:56.610 --> 02:15:58.110
<v Speaker 2>You start thinking a bunch of different things.</v>

5166
02:15:58.440 --> 02:16:00.150
<v Speaker 2>You have to have control of your mind.</v>

5167
02:16:00.151 --> 02:16:02.400
<v Speaker 2>It's not as simple as you get in the float tank,</v>

5168
02:16:02.460 --> 02:16:02.851
<v Speaker 2>boom.</v>

5169
02:16:02.851 --> 02:16:04.050
<v Speaker 2>You have hallucinations.</v>

5170
02:16:04.290 --> 02:16:07.440
<v Speaker 2>You have to get in the full tank and you've got to start that process on your</v>

5171
02:16:07.441 --> 02:16:08.040
<v Speaker 2>own.</v>

5172
02:16:08.040 --> 02:16:09.270
<v Speaker 2>You have to center yourself.</v>

5173
02:16:09.271 --> 02:16:10.860
<v Speaker 2>You have to concentrate only on your breath,</v>

5174
02:16:11.100 --> 02:16:13.710
<v Speaker 2>drop everything slowly but surely.</v>

5175
02:16:13.920 --> 02:16:16.440
<v Speaker 2>Remove all the layers of consciousness,</v>

5176
02:16:16.470 --> 02:16:20.670
<v Speaker 2>all the layers of letting go until you get to the center and that's when you</v>

5177
02:16:20.671 --> 02:16:22.310
<v Speaker 2>start having these crazy visionary experiences.</v>

5178
02:16:22.311 --> 02:16:23.640
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of like a same thing.</v>

5179
02:16:23.641 --> 02:16:24.061
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure mushrooms,</v>

5180
02:16:24.061 --> 02:16:25.980
<v Speaker 2>it's like when you were talking to your friends and laughing and stuff.</v>

5181
02:16:25.981 --> 02:16:26.371
<v Speaker 2>It's fun.</v>

5182
02:16:26.371 --> 02:16:26.610
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

5183
02:16:26.610 --> 02:16:26.781
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>

5184
02:16:26.781 --> 02:16:27.030
<v Speaker 2>I could,</v>

5185
02:16:27.030 --> 02:16:30.040
<v Speaker 2>and then you just stop and like look up at the and just</v>

5186
02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:31.300
<v Speaker 1>don't talk or listen to anyone.</v>

5187
02:16:31.510 --> 02:16:32.830
<v Speaker 1>That's when he started seeing shit.</v>

5188
02:16:32.890 --> 02:16:33.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5189
02:16:33.580 --> 02:16:36.970
<v Speaker 1>It's guy just was telling me the other day about the same thing that he went and</v>

5190
02:16:36.971 --> 02:16:38.050
<v Speaker 1>he was more of just like,</v>

5191
02:16:38.130 --> 02:16:38.321
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

5192
02:16:38.321 --> 02:16:39.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm just bored and you know,</v>

5193
02:16:39.881 --> 02:16:40.850
<v Speaker 1>I'm just laying here.</v>

5194
02:16:41.110 --> 02:16:41.980
<v Speaker 1>This is really stupid.</v>

5195
02:16:42.010 --> 02:16:42.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

5196
02:16:42.430 --> 02:16:42.910
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

5197
02:16:42.910 --> 02:16:43.361
<v Speaker 1>Well if he,</v>

5198
02:16:43.361 --> 02:16:44.650
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know how to use it.</v>

5199
02:16:44.680 --> 02:16:45.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5200
02:16:45.130 --> 02:16:45.701
<v Speaker 1>Anything else?</v>

5201
02:16:45.701 --> 02:16:46.001
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5202
02:16:46.001 --> 02:16:47.890
<v Speaker 1>you have to learn how to relax.</v>

5203
02:16:47.891 --> 02:16:49.780
<v Speaker 1>I don't run your thoughts of all of them.</v>

5204
02:16:50.380 --> 02:16:54.940
<v Speaker 1>You for the idea behind the sensory deprivation tank is that there's no input</v>

5205
02:16:54.941 --> 02:16:57.850
<v Speaker 1>coming in and when there's no input coming in and you could just sit there and</v>

5206
02:16:57.851 --> 02:16:57.971
<v Speaker 1>go,</v>

5207
02:16:57.971 --> 02:16:58.250
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

5208
02:16:58.250 --> 02:16:59.530
<v Speaker 1>socks on board.</v>

5209
02:16:59.890 --> 02:17:04.890
<v Speaker 1>Or You could just slowly let go of all your consciousness to the point where</v>

5210
02:17:05.051 --> 02:17:05.320
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

5211
02:17:05.320 --> 02:17:07.360
<v Speaker 1>you are just your mind.</v>

5212
02:17:07.420 --> 02:17:09.190
<v Speaker 1>Untethered from culture,</v>

5213
02:17:09.220 --> 02:17:11.770
<v Speaker 1>from any interactive experience with nature,</v>

5214
02:17:11.771 --> 02:17:12.041
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

5215
02:17:12.041 --> 02:17:12.970
<v Speaker 1>with gravity,</v>

5216
02:17:12.971 --> 02:17:15.820
<v Speaker 1>with seeing things or hearing things or touching things.</v>

5217
02:17:16.000 --> 02:17:17.860
<v Speaker 1>You removed from all sensory input.</v>

5218
02:17:18.070 --> 02:17:19.030
<v Speaker 1>And when you do that,</v>

5219
02:17:19.031 --> 02:17:22.030
<v Speaker 1>you can have very clear and intense thoughts.</v>

5220
02:17:22.300 --> 02:17:26.140
<v Speaker 1>And you can also have some pretty powerful hallucinations if you allow yourself</v>

5221
02:17:26.440 --> 02:17:28.090
<v Speaker 1>to manifest those ideas.</v>

5222
02:17:28.330 --> 02:17:30.190
<v Speaker 1>But you have to learn how to let go to do that.</v>

5223
02:17:30.191 --> 02:17:31.120
<v Speaker 1>You can't just get in there.</v>

5224
02:17:31.121 --> 02:17:32.680
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't just happen right away.</v>

5225
02:17:33.070 --> 02:17:33.270
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

5226
02:17:33.270 --> 02:17:34.480
<v Speaker 1>you start thinking about your life,</v>

5227
02:17:34.481 --> 02:17:36.370
<v Speaker 1>you start thinking about things that you can't avoid.</v>

5228
02:17:36.400 --> 02:17:38.420
<v Speaker 1>You start thinking about things that had been bothering you,</v>

5229
02:17:38.870 --> 02:17:39.760
<v Speaker 1>like about yourself.</v>

5230
02:17:40.340 --> 02:17:40.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5231
02:17:40.460 --> 02:17:41.230
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5232
02:17:41.230 --> 02:17:41.351
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

5233
02:17:41.351 --> 02:17:41.561
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

5234
02:17:41.561 --> 02:17:42.394
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily.</v>

5235
02:17:42.640 --> 02:17:42.791
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

5236
02:17:42.791 --> 02:17:44.620
<v Speaker 1>it depends on what's going on in your head,</v>

5237
02:17:44.621 --> 02:17:48.340
<v Speaker 1>but for the most part we just sort of accentuates experience on a small version</v>

5238
02:17:48.341 --> 02:17:49.570
<v Speaker 1>of this plans.</v>

5239
02:17:49.571 --> 02:17:53.200
<v Speaker 1>Recently I've just taken some pock cookie or something.</v>

5240
02:17:53.201 --> 02:17:54.840
<v Speaker 1>It's going gonna be a long flight and just so you know,</v>

5241
02:17:54.910 --> 02:17:56.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm not getting anything done here,</v>

5242
02:17:56.400 --> 02:17:56.770
<v Speaker 1>but it's not,</v>

5243
02:17:56.770 --> 02:17:59.590
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not tired when I've slept and it's like I like 2:00 PM flight or</v>

5244
02:17:59.591 --> 02:18:02.920
<v Speaker 1>something that I just look out the window and I just stare out the window.</v>

5245
02:18:02.920 --> 02:18:05.170
<v Speaker 1>I'm just let my mind just go the entire time.</v>

5246
02:18:05.530 --> 02:18:06.363
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5247
02:18:06.740 --> 02:18:11.560
<v Speaker 1>The only way I get a really get blasted these days is on planes because when I</v>

5248
02:18:11.561 --> 02:18:13.330
<v Speaker 1>interviewed enough from the outside can help you,</v>

5249
02:18:13.331 --> 02:18:17.100
<v Speaker 1>like just start like a synapse going a little bit sure out.</v>

5250
02:18:18.060 --> 02:18:20.800
<v Speaker 1>Also it's like the only time I don't have any responsibilities,</v>

5251
02:18:21.530 --> 02:18:23.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to take care of my kids.</v>

5252
02:18:23.141 --> 02:18:24.070
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to be,</v>

5253
02:18:24.071 --> 02:18:24.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5254
02:18:24.340 --> 02:18:25.173
<v Speaker 1>sober.</v>

5255
02:18:25.540 --> 02:18:26.440
<v Speaker 1>There's no Wifi in the,</v>

5256
02:18:26.441 --> 02:18:27.071
<v Speaker 1>it's even better.</v>

5257
02:18:27.071 --> 02:18:28.580
<v Speaker 1>It's like I can't do anything.</v>

5258
02:18:29.260 --> 02:18:32.020
<v Speaker 1>It's a great way to write to 10 minutes about the per trip.</v>

5259
02:18:32.080 --> 02:18:32.651
<v Speaker 1>Well I'll leave it,</v>

5260
02:18:32.651 --> 02:18:35.350
<v Speaker 1>I'll leave it on my lap and just like if I get a thought that I'm like,</v>

5261
02:18:35.410 --> 02:18:36.580
<v Speaker 1>oh gosh that could work.</v>

5262
02:18:36.581 --> 02:18:37.930
<v Speaker 1>As I quickly write it down,</v>

5263
02:18:37.931 --> 02:18:39.420
<v Speaker 1>I type so much better than I write.</v>

5264
02:18:39.900 --> 02:18:40.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm really,</v>

5265
02:18:40.410 --> 02:18:42.730
<v Speaker 1>I've hardly write anything anymore and I can type pretty quick.</v>

5266
02:18:42.760 --> 02:18:45.280
<v Speaker 1>I type really quick now so I have to type.</v>

5267
02:18:45.580 --> 02:18:46.420
<v Speaker 1>But I like it.</v>

5268
02:18:46.421 --> 02:18:46.601
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

5269
02:18:46.601 --> 02:18:47.920
<v Speaker 1>I really love writing on playing.</v>

5270
02:18:47.921 --> 02:18:48.850
<v Speaker 1>It's one of my favorite things.</v>

5271
02:18:48.851 --> 02:18:49.980
<v Speaker 1>I write some of my best shit ever.</v>

5272
02:18:49.981 --> 02:18:52.630
<v Speaker 1>I'm plans high as fuck.</v>

5273
02:18:52.631 --> 02:18:55.210
<v Speaker 1>I've really started flying later that now so I can do that.</v>

5274
02:18:55.240 --> 02:18:55.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5275
02:18:55.540 --> 02:18:58.510
<v Speaker 1>Cause it is a good place to just get away from everything and like get things</v>

5276
02:18:58.511 --> 02:18:58.900
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>

5277
02:18:58.900 --> 02:18:59.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5278
02:18:59.410 --> 02:18:59.651
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5279
02:18:59.651 --> 02:19:01.780
<v Speaker 1>When you're sitting in that seat you got nowhere to go and you've got that</v>

5280
02:19:01.781 --> 02:19:02.531
<v Speaker 1>laptop open,</v>

5281
02:19:02.531 --> 02:19:04.010
<v Speaker 1>you can get slips or noon.</v>

5282
02:19:04.030 --> 02:19:04.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

5283
02:19:04.590 --> 02:19:05.290
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

5284
02:19:05.290 --> 02:19:06.580
<v Speaker 1>and then it's just like now it's,</v>

5285
02:19:06.740 --> 02:19:07.180
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

5286
02:19:07.180 --> 02:19:07.541
<v Speaker 1>Don't you,</v>

5287
02:19:07.541 --> 02:19:08.920
<v Speaker 1>do you feel now that you're,</v>

5288
02:19:08.921 --> 02:19:11.110
<v Speaker 1>you're having all this success and things are going well,</v>

5289
02:19:11.120 --> 02:19:12.940
<v Speaker 1>you feel like even more motivated.</v>

5290
02:19:12.941 --> 02:19:16.290
<v Speaker 1>Like you're like fucking really hustling now and really putting in the work to</v>

5291
02:19:16.320 --> 02:19:17.890
<v Speaker 1>add more stuff or more,</v>

5292
02:19:18.070 --> 02:19:18.903
<v Speaker 1>isn't it fun?</v>

5293
02:19:19.070 --> 02:19:24.070
<v Speaker 1>My next thing I like how like like motion begets more most yet people or force</v>

5294
02:19:25.301 --> 02:19:25.960
<v Speaker 1>of habit.</v>

5295
02:19:25.960 --> 02:19:26.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5296
02:19:26.320 --> 02:19:29.000
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what it is and where be able to work out all the time.</v>

5297
02:19:29.001 --> 02:19:29.560
<v Speaker 1>It's just like that,</v>

5298
02:19:29.560 --> 02:19:31.350
<v Speaker 1>that's your habit and when you do the Joe all the time,</v>

5299
02:19:31.351 --> 02:19:32.184
<v Speaker 1>then that's your habit.</v>

5300
02:19:32.670 --> 02:19:32.881
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

5301
02:19:32.881 --> 02:19:36.900
<v Speaker 2>And that's one thing that people have kept telling me over and over again from</v>

5302
02:19:36.901 --> 02:19:37.681
<v Speaker 2>this podcast.</v>

5303
02:19:37.681 --> 02:19:41.670
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that they pull from it is that it's changed the way they sort</v>

5304
02:19:41.671 --> 02:19:43.110
<v Speaker 2>of address and approach things.</v>

5305
02:19:43.410 --> 02:19:43.981
<v Speaker 2>And people,</v>

5306
02:19:43.981 --> 02:19:44.251
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

5307
02:19:44.251 --> 02:19:46.720
<v Speaker 2>sometimes people just need to hear something and it's like one things,</v>

5308
02:19:46.740 --> 02:19:48.000
<v Speaker 2>reasons why I love that book.</v>

5309
02:19:48.001 --> 02:19:48.834
<v Speaker 2>The war of art.</v>

5310
02:19:48.960 --> 02:19:52.290
<v Speaker 2>I probably understand and I've thought most of the things in that book on my own</v>

5311
02:19:52.291 --> 02:19:53.040
<v Speaker 2>independently.</v>

5312
02:19:53.040 --> 02:19:54.230
<v Speaker 2>I think a lot of creative people,</v>

5313
02:19:55.040 --> 02:19:56.400
<v Speaker 2>it's not that you can't piece it together.</v>

5314
02:19:56.401 --> 02:19:58.080
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes you need to read it again.</v>

5315
02:19:58.200 --> 02:19:59.130
<v Speaker 2>You need to see it again.</v>

5316
02:19:59.131 --> 02:20:00.330
<v Speaker 2>You need to be reminded again.</v>

5317
02:20:00.331 --> 02:20:03.540
<v Speaker 2>You need to clear when it's written out or when you can actually see it or when</v>

5318
02:20:03.541 --> 02:20:04.470
<v Speaker 2>it's spelled out.</v>

5319
02:20:04.500 --> 02:20:09.480
<v Speaker 2>When someone say's says it in a way that resonates with you know how you feel</v>

5320
02:20:09.481 --> 02:20:10.314
<v Speaker 2>about the world.</v>

5321
02:20:10.500 --> 02:20:14.820
<v Speaker 2>And I think that's one way that we can all help each other in a way that no one</v>

5322
02:20:15.600 --> 02:20:17.700
<v Speaker 2>of past generations was able to do.</v>

5323
02:20:17.910 --> 02:20:19.920
<v Speaker 2>One of the different things about this sort of a medium,</v>

5324
02:20:19.921 --> 02:20:20.820
<v Speaker 2>like a podcast,</v>

5325
02:20:20.900 --> 02:20:22.380
<v Speaker 2>medium contact with everyone in the world,</v>

5326
02:20:22.440 --> 02:20:25.620
<v Speaker 2>quick contact with everyone in the world and you can express things in a way</v>

5327
02:20:25.621 --> 02:20:28.880
<v Speaker 2>that you really couldn't do if you were sponsored by Palmolive or fucking the</v>

5328
02:20:28.970 --> 02:20:29.803
<v Speaker 2>trucks.</v>

5329
02:20:29.940 --> 02:20:30.241
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

5330
02:20:30.241 --> 02:20:32.250
<v Speaker 2>it's like you would have never gotten all these,</v>

5331
02:20:33.240 --> 02:20:36.120
<v Speaker 2>this information out as clearly as we're doing it right now.</v>

5332
02:20:36.460 --> 02:20:36.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5333
