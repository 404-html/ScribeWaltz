<v Speaker 1>I've talked about this on the podcast</v>

16
00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:42.380
<v Speaker 1>with nutrients and food and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good for people who did this</v>

<v Speaker 1>crazy appalachian trail thing and these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these bars that you sell have become</v>

18
00:00:47.301 --> 00:00:52.301
<v Speaker 1>very popular with hunters and people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that like to go on a backpack.</v>

19
00:00:52.551 --> 00:00:57.551
<v Speaker 1>Journeys deep into the back country and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found out about you from a rich,</v>

20
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.970
<v Speaker 1>rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rich outdoors podcast and that's where I</v>

21
00:01:01.971 --> 00:01:04.310
<v Speaker 1>listened to you on his podcast and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why.</v>

22
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.050
<v Speaker 1>That's why you're here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I got.</v>

23
00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.690
<v Speaker 1>Cody loved the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

24
00:01:08.691 --> 00:01:12.380
<v Speaker 1>it's a good podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what the fuck for people who don't</v>

25
00:01:12.381 --> 00:01:14.810
<v Speaker 1>know the Appalachian trail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about this on the podcast</v>

26
00:01:14.811 --> 00:01:17.870
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a trail where people walk from</v>

27
00:01:17.871 --> 00:01:21.380
<v Speaker 1>Georgia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right all the way up to Maine or,</v>

28
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.870
<v Speaker 1>or vice versa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vice versa if you want,</v>

29
00:01:23.871 --> 00:01:27.440
<v Speaker 1>if you're a madman and it takes you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many months?</v>

30
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.570
<v Speaker 2>Five to seven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Took me a little over six.</v>

31
00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.280
<v Speaker 1>So you just hike for six months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you're at month three,</v>

32
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.770
<v Speaker 1>do you ever go like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck am I doing?</v>

33
00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:42.530
<v Speaker 2>Long story short?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

34
00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.350
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by month three I was actually</v>

35
00:01:45.351 --> 00:01:50.150
<v Speaker 2>approaching winter time and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wintertime camping is just a</v>

36
00:01:50.151 --> 00:01:53.630
<v Speaker 2>fundamentally different experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So not only have you been hiking that</v>

37
00:01:53.631 --> 00:01:55.550
<v Speaker 2>long and you're tired and your body's</v>
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

38
00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just done doing it every day of hiking.</v>

39
00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:02.090
<v Speaker 2>But then the elements of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the winter come in and that's,</v>

40
00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.670
<v Speaker 2>that was a different ballgame entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

41
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.990
<v Speaker 2>how many people have done this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Less than $10,000.</v>

42
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.590
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot of fucking people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

43
00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.060
<v Speaker 2>it is still a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have said like 50,</v>

44
00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.340
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's another thing called the triple</v>

45
00:02:16.341 --> 00:02:17.390
<v Speaker 2>crown,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the,</v>

46
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.290
<v Speaker 2>it's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

47
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.650
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the 80 a pacific crest trail and</v>

48
00:02:21.651 --> 00:02:24.740
<v Speaker 2>the continental divide trail and I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>less than a hundred people have done all</v>

49
00:02:24.741 --> 00:02:25.520
<v Speaker 2>three of those.</v>

50
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.520
<v Speaker 1>The Pacific crest trail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that the one that goes from like</v>

51
00:02:28.521 --> 00:02:30.330
<v Speaker 1>Mexico tall to</v>

52
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.070
<v Speaker 2>Canada?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's through California.</v>

53
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.920
<v Speaker 2>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long did that one take?</v>

54
00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.440
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think so.</v>

55
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.190
<v Speaker 2>Appalachian trail is 2100 miles and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pacific crest trail,</v>

56
00:02:41.191 --> 00:02:45.600
<v Speaker 2>I believe it's like 25,</v>
<v Speaker 2>26 when he was 700 miles.</v>

57
00:02:45.601 --> 00:02:50.601
<v Speaker 2>But the trail gradient is a lot easier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I think like on any given day you can</v>

58
00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:54.240
<v Speaker 2>actually hike more miles even though the</v>
<v Speaker 2>trails is longer than the 80,</v>

59
00:02:54.241 --> 00:02:56.700
<v Speaker 2>but I think people actually finish it</v>
<v Speaker 2>faster than the eat.</v>

60
00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.800
<v Speaker 2>I like how you call it the 80 inside</v>
<v Speaker 2>lingo</v>

61
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.650
<v Speaker 1>maniacs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you hiking maniacs?</v>

62
00:03:02.651 --> 00:03:05.350
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck got you into this man?</v>

63
00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.830
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a long story.</v>

64
00:03:07.831 --> 00:03:09.460
<v Speaker 2>Short boy scouts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

65
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.010
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

66
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.400
<v Speaker 2>I joined boy scouts later than most</v>
<v Speaker 2>people I joined when I was 14.</v>

67
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.470
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

68
00:03:16.471 --> 00:03:19.500
<v Speaker 2>the kind of the pinnacle of the Boy</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scout Careers,</v>

69
00:03:19.501 --> 00:03:23.130
<v Speaker 2>getting your Eagle Scout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I joined with that in mind.</v>

70
00:03:23.131 --> 00:03:23.611
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

71
00:03:23.611 --> 00:03:26.460
<v Speaker 2>I'm joining later than most I joined</v>
<v Speaker 2>when most people are quitting boy</v>

72
00:03:26.461 --> 00:03:27.360
<v Speaker 2>scouts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

73
00:03:27.361 --> 00:03:31.050
<v Speaker 2>they go from cub scouts like 13 and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>quit by joined and I was like,</v>

74
00:03:31.051 --> 00:03:33.400
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want my eagle scout and we,</v>

75
00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:36.050
<v Speaker 2>you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to get your Eagle Scout spin 20</v>

76
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.580
<v Speaker 2>nights in the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not consecutively,</v>

77
00:03:38.581 --> 00:03:39.930
<v Speaker 2>but you have to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

78
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.540
<v Speaker 2>get your camping merit badge and get</v>
<v Speaker 2>your camping merit badge.</v>

79
00:03:42.541 --> 00:03:44.730
<v Speaker 2>You have to spend the night 20 nights in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the woods.</v>

80
00:03:44.731 --> 00:03:46.490
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

81
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:50.640
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was in Georgia and the foothills of</v>

82
00:03:50.641 --> 00:03:52.860
<v Speaker 2>the Appalachian mountains are in north</v>
<v Speaker 2>Georgia.</v>

83
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.800
<v Speaker 2>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

84
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.010
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the beginning of the Appalachian trail</v>

85
00:03:56.011 --> 00:03:56.850
<v Speaker 2>is also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

86
00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.530
<v Speaker 2>right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we went on several trips up there in</v>

87
00:04:01.531 --> 00:04:03.990
<v Speaker 2>north Georgia and I got exposed to it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

88
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.220
<v Speaker 2>and I think the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just the idea of getting on this small</v>

89
00:04:08.221 --> 00:04:10.070
<v Speaker 2>trail and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

90
00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.080
<v Speaker 2>kind of looking down and understanding</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this thing goes on for 2000 more</v>

91
00:04:16.111 --> 00:04:20.070
<v Speaker 2>miles was just kinda like one that just</v>
<v Speaker 2>seems crazy.</v>

92
00:04:20.071 --> 00:04:20.670
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

93
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.390
<v Speaker 2>there's no way I'm ever going to have</v>
<v Speaker 2>enough time or we're kind of the uh,</v>

94
00:04:24.391 --> 00:04:26.430
<v Speaker 2>the drive to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

95
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.140
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was definitely kind of the</v>

96
00:04:28.141 --> 00:04:28.831
<v Speaker 2>mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

97
00:04:28.831 --> 00:04:30.510
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that just seems like an adventure I want</v>

98
00:04:30.511 --> 00:04:32.040
<v Speaker 2>to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

99
00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.030
<v Speaker 2>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>

100
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.850
<v Speaker 2>that was definitely the beginning of it</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was about 14 years old going up</v>

101
00:04:35.851 --> 00:04:37.740
<v Speaker 2>there and hiking on it for overnight</v>
<v Speaker 2>trips.</v>

102
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.830
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does one fund something like this?</v>

103
00:04:40.831 --> 00:04:45.270
<v Speaker 1>Because I would assume you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to be independently wealthy or</v>

104
00:04:45.271 --> 00:04:49.710
<v Speaker 1>you have to have squirreled away enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>money so you could walk for seven months</v>

105
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.950
<v Speaker 1>and feed yourself in the process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or did you work along the way?</v>

106
00:04:52.951 --> 00:04:53.784
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

107
00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:55.260
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>

108
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.530
<v Speaker 2>I think there's a big misconception that</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

109
00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.950
<v Speaker 2>it takes a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in reality it's like what are your</v>

110
00:05:01.951 --> 00:05:03.450
<v Speaker 2>expenses?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just food,</v>

111
00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then gear ahead of time.</v>

112
00:05:05.041 --> 00:05:06.410
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

113
00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most hikers are kind of known as the,</v>

114
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.260
<v Speaker 2>like the Athletic Hobo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

115
00:05:11.261 --> 00:05:15.540
<v Speaker 2>like they are grimy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not spending money on hotels,</v>

116
00:05:15.541 --> 00:05:18.870
<v Speaker 2>there's no accommodation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no car payments,</v>

117
00:05:18.871 --> 00:05:21.120
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're walking so you can really</v>

118
00:05:21.121 --> 00:05:23.850
<v Speaker 2>eliminate all expenses when you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

119
00:05:23.851 --> 00:05:24.690
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean for me,</v>

120
00:05:24.691 --> 00:05:26.640
<v Speaker 2>I had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was an accountant,</v>

121
00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.350
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

122
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.390
<v Speaker 2>I'd been an accountant for about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

123
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:33.870
<v Speaker 2>two years and I saved up some money and</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

124
00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:37.620
<v Speaker 2>I basically knew that I wanted to take</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hit so I started saving up some</v>

125
00:05:37.621 --> 00:05:39.380
<v Speaker 2>money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but any,</v>

126
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:41.460
<v Speaker 2>any given through hiker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what they're called.</v>

127
00:05:41.461 --> 00:05:43.020
<v Speaker 2>Anybody that does,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

128
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:44.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it starts in Georgia,</v>

129
00:05:44.791 --> 00:05:48.270
<v Speaker 2>ends in Maine or Maine to Georgia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody that does that hike,</v>

130
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.760
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in one consecutive runs,</v>

131
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.490
<v Speaker 2>it's called a through hiker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but any,</v>

132
00:05:52.491 --> 00:05:56.010
<v Speaker 2>any through hike I would,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would say it takes about $5,000 from</v>

133
00:05:56.011 --> 00:06:01.011
<v Speaker 2>gear to sleeping in hotels about once a</v>
<v Speaker 2>week to resupplying foods.</v>

134
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:06.971
<v Speaker 2>So thinking about $5,000 for six months</v>
<v Speaker 2>of living like ain't too bad,</v>

135
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.130
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you think about $5,000 for six months of</v>

136
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:13.250
<v Speaker 2>living in the real world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I've never lived that cheaply,</v>

137
00:06:13.251 --> 00:06:13.830
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

138
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:14.281
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

139
00:06:14.281 --> 00:06:15.510
<v Speaker 1>it's not that bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

140
00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:18.480
<v Speaker 1>but like you're saying hotels once a</v>
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>

141
00:06:18.481 --> 00:06:22.110
<v Speaker 1>So what would merit a hotel stay is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>ferocious whether,</v>

142
00:06:22.111 --> 00:06:22.944
<v Speaker 1>like what,</v>

143
00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.340
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of things.</v>

144
00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:27.830
<v Speaker 2>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you typically are within five to seven</v>

145
00:06:27.831 --> 00:06:31.850
<v Speaker 2>days of a town,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the trail kind of goes along the</v>

146
00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:36.851
<v Speaker 2>mountains and then about every five to</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven days you come to a trail crossing,</v>

147
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:42.070
<v Speaker 2>which is a highway or anything that</v>
<v Speaker 2>would lead to a nearby town and every</v>

148
00:06:43.281 --> 00:06:45.590
<v Speaker 2>five to seven days you're out of food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

149
00:06:45.591 --> 00:06:48.430
<v Speaker 2>that's the biggest thing that I think</v>
<v Speaker 2>pulls you into towns.</v>

150
00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.380
<v Speaker 2>You need to resupply.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're not out there foraging for</v>

151
00:06:51.381 --> 00:06:54.350
<v Speaker 2>nuts and berries or or hunting or</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything like that.</v>

152
00:06:54.351 --> 00:06:56.990
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're relying on getting to town,</v>

153
00:06:56.991 --> 00:07:00.740
<v Speaker 2>getting to a grocery store and getting</v>
<v Speaker 2>all your food.</v>

154
00:07:00.741 --> 00:07:03.740
<v Speaker 2>So every five to seven days you go into</v>
<v Speaker 2>town and you get food.</v>

155
00:07:03.741 --> 00:07:05.030
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whoa man,</v>

156
00:07:05.031 --> 00:07:07.190
<v Speaker 2>I also haven't showered in five to seven</v>
<v Speaker 2>days.</v>

157
00:07:07.191 --> 00:07:10.260
<v Speaker 2>I also haven't done laundry in five to</v>
<v Speaker 2>seven days and you know,</v>

158
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:14.090
<v Speaker 2>you're hiking with really one change of</v>
<v Speaker 2>clothes.</v>

159
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:16.760
<v Speaker 2>So you can imagine if you're hiking 20</v>
<v Speaker 2>miles a day,</v>

160
00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:19.700
<v Speaker 2>the grime and the dirt that can build</v>
<v Speaker 2>up.</v>

161
00:07:19.701 --> 00:07:23.240
<v Speaker 2>So when you come to town,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to do laundry,</v>

162
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:25.640
<v Speaker 2>resupply food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to stay in a hotel,</v>

163
00:07:25.641 --> 00:07:29.990
<v Speaker 2>you want to clean off your body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your feet are starting to grow stuff.</v>

164
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:31.850
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've been sweating,</v>

165
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:35.660
<v Speaker 2>walking through muddy trails.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's just a lot of grime.</v>

166
00:07:35.661 --> 00:07:39.530
<v Speaker 2>When you get to town,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a big refresh,</v>

167
00:07:39.531 --> 00:07:40.160
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

168
00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:42.170
<v Speaker 1>But when you make that big refresh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you,</v>

169
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.850
<v Speaker 1>do you ever go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why am I doing this?</v>

170
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:46.263
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of,</v>

171
00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:48.060
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of ironic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're on you.</v>

172
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:51.850
<v Speaker 2>You make the intention of going down the</v>
<v Speaker 2>trail to get outside of town and outside</v>

173
00:07:51.851 --> 00:07:54.040
<v Speaker 2>of society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of the biggest things you look</v>

174
00:07:54.041 --> 00:07:56.500
<v Speaker 2>forward to is getting back into town,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

175
00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:57.251
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

176
00:07:57.251 --> 00:07:58.870
<v Speaker 2>And it's kind of like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

177
00:07:58.871 --> 00:07:59.920
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you get to town it's like,</v>

178
00:07:59.921 --> 00:08:01.570
<v Speaker 2>why am I doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are kind of.</v>

179
00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:04.750
<v Speaker 2>I was kind of dreading getting back out</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the trail a lot of times because it</v>

180
00:08:04.751 --> 00:08:06.790
<v Speaker 2>was just so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Man,</v>

181
00:08:06.791 --> 00:08:08.710
<v Speaker 2>I have a hot shower,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I shaved,</v>

182
00:08:08.711 --> 00:08:10.270
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so nice.</v>

183
00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first time I did any camping in</v>

184
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:17.730
<v Speaker 1>since the boys scouts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're.</v>

185
00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was a boy scout when I was 13 for one</v>

186
00:08:22.260 --> 00:08:25.740
<v Speaker 1>summer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these fucking inner city creeps that</v>

187
00:08:25.741 --> 00:08:28.800
<v Speaker 1>I went to the boy scouts with and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamaica Plain Massachusetts,</v>

188
00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.440
<v Speaker 1>which is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now it's more a gentrified,</v>

189
00:08:31.441 --> 00:08:34.380
<v Speaker 1>but back then it was kind of a shady</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood picking on,</v>

190
00:08:34.390 --> 00:08:35.201
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

191
00:08:35.201 --> 00:08:37.860
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would Thai kids up and leave them</v>

192
00:08:37.861 --> 00:08:41.190
<v Speaker 1>in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They would tie you up to your bunk and</v>

193
00:08:41.191 --> 00:08:43.230
<v Speaker 1>then leave you in the woods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put toothpaste all over your</v>

194
00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:45.360
<v Speaker 1>clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't get out there just fucking</v>

195
00:08:45.361 --> 00:08:46.840
<v Speaker 1>shitty kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>

196
00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:50.580
<v Speaker 1>it was like a total free fall for all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was just really didn't because we</v>

197
00:08:50.581 --> 00:08:53.520
<v Speaker 1>went to the woods in New Hampshire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where the boy scouts or take you</v>

198
00:08:53.521 --> 00:08:57.950
<v Speaker 1>up and I remember like these fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>camp counselors are weird guys that</v>

199
00:08:57.951 --> 00:09:02.040
<v Speaker 1>barely paying attention and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically like all these inner city</v>

200
00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:03.540
<v Speaker 1>teenagers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>street scouts,</v>

201
00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:04.000
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

202
00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.010
<v Speaker 1>There's just running rampant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like uh,</v>

203
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:11.010
<v Speaker 1>there was a rifle range where they would</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot 20 twos and there was an archery</v>

204
00:09:11.011 --> 00:09:12.390
<v Speaker 1>range.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I remember I was at the archery</v>

205
00:09:12.391 --> 00:09:14.850
<v Speaker 1>range.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hurt and I was like,</v>

206
00:09:14.851 --> 00:09:15.900
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they go,</v>

207
00:09:15.901 --> 00:09:18.940
<v Speaker 1>that's a ricochet and I'm at what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

208
00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:22.680
<v Speaker 1>check please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so I decided to just go fishing</v>

209
00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.500
<v Speaker 1>every day I was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would avoid everybody.</v>

210
00:09:25.501 --> 00:09:28.980
<v Speaker 1>There was like all those things on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>agenda that you were supposed to do,</v>

211
00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.530
<v Speaker 1>fuck you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just took off and I went and found</v>

212
00:09:31.531 --> 00:09:35.190
<v Speaker 1>this pond and I would go to that pond</v>
<v Speaker 1>every day for the week that I was up</v>

213
00:09:35.191 --> 00:09:38.700
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My point being sent from that time from</v>

214
00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
<v Speaker 1>13 till 2012,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had had not gone camping and then I</v>

215
00:09:44.611 --> 00:09:48.330
<v Speaker 1>went camping in Montana in October and</v>
<v Speaker 1>really cold,</v>

216
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:53.660
<v Speaker 1>it was like nine degrees and we were out</v>
<v Speaker 1>there for six or seven days and when we</v>

217
00:09:53.881 --> 00:09:57.840
<v Speaker 1>went back we went back to a hotel and I</v>
<v Speaker 1>remember thinking this is the greatest</v>

218
00:09:57.841 --> 00:10:01.260
<v Speaker 1>shower the world has ever known.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that feeling.</v>

219
00:10:01.261 --> 00:10:03.660
<v Speaker 1>You don't appreciate showers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

220
00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:06.660
<v Speaker 1>Probably nobody appreciates a shower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like an appalachian trail hiker.</v>

221
00:10:06.661 --> 00:10:07.680
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>

222
00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:11.820
<v Speaker 1>It's pure ecstasy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like showers normal,</v>

223
00:10:12.330 --> 00:10:16.530
<v Speaker 1>like a normal showers normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like if you got to shower after</v>

224
00:10:16.531 --> 00:10:21.531
<v Speaker 1>you're hiking for seven days with muddy</v>
<v Speaker 1>feet and your clothes stink and</v>

225
00:10:21.610 --> 00:10:22.860
<v Speaker 1>everything's gross and</v>

226
00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:25.730
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need that deprivation to appreciate</v>

227
00:10:25.731 --> 00:10:26.210
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

228
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:27.320
<v Speaker 1>you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

229
00:10:27.321 --> 00:10:29.480
<v Speaker 1>Because most people don't appreciate</v>
<v Speaker 1>showers.</v>

230
00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:32.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess it's like the starving kid</v>

231
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:33.230
<v Speaker 2>needing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

232
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:34.380
<v Speaker 2>when he gets food,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>

233
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:35.610
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

238
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.780
<v Speaker 2>You gotta yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotTa keep in mind anybody who's</v>

239
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:53.270
<v Speaker 2>willing to take six months out of their</v>
<v Speaker 2>life to go to the woods,</v>

240
00:10:53.630 --> 00:10:54.890
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be a different breed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

241
00:10:54.891 --> 00:10:56.570
<v Speaker 2>I think you definitely have your</v>
<v Speaker 2>stereotypes.</v>

242
00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.180
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some people are other just kind of for</v>

243
00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:03.530
<v Speaker 2>the challenge and the a out of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dare I say athletic side of it,</v>

244
00:11:03.531 --> 00:11:06.940
<v Speaker 2>but it's like a different side of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

245
00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:08.210
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Kinda like a,</v>

246
00:11:08.211 --> 00:11:11.000
<v Speaker 2>I want to power through this and see how</v>
<v Speaker 2>much my body can handle.</v>

247
00:11:11.210 --> 00:11:13.680
<v Speaker 2>You get those kinds of hikers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you definitely get the,</v>

248
00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:17.210
<v Speaker 2>the hippie dropout,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a life kind of guys,</v>

249
00:11:17.211 --> 00:11:19.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like I just want to get out</v>

250
00:11:19.851 --> 00:11:20.601
<v Speaker 2>there and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and,</v>

251
00:11:20.601 --> 00:11:22.760
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get away from society for a little bit</v>

252
00:11:22.761 --> 00:11:24.950
<v Speaker 2>so that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of stereotype.</v>

253
00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:27.170
<v Speaker 2>You definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those are just gonna get some Weirdos</v>

254
00:11:27.171 --> 00:11:27.920
<v Speaker 2>out there.</v>

255
00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine if you ever had an</v>

256
00:11:29.401 --> 00:11:32.090
<v Speaker 1>uncomfortable moments where you like</v>
<v Speaker 1>scared to camp with people.</v>

257
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:35.200
<v Speaker 2>No doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was one time a man,</v>

258
00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:39.340
<v Speaker 2>there was a Pennsylvania.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Pennsylvania,</v>

259
00:11:39.341 --> 00:11:39.651
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

260
00:11:39.651 --> 00:11:41.530
<v Speaker 2>a lot of those x coal towns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

261
00:11:41.531 --> 00:11:46.531
<v Speaker 2>their economy just plummeted and the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it goes through a lot of those towns.</v>

262
00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.780
<v Speaker 2>So you'd have some people near town</v>
<v Speaker 2>going out there for an overnight or,</v>

263
00:11:51.781 --> 00:11:55.810
<v Speaker 2>and they are what are called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're like these three walled wooden</v>

264
00:11:55.811 --> 00:11:58.510
<v Speaker 2>structures that are made by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

265
00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:00.100
<v Speaker 2>well all sorts of organizations make</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

266
00:12:00.101 --> 00:12:03.340
<v Speaker 2>But in general they're about every 10 to</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 miles along the 80.</v>

267
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.840
<v Speaker 2>So in theory you can sleep in these</v>
<v Speaker 2>every night and not need a tent.</v>

268
00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:09.400
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't recommend that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

269
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.770
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you do try to sleep in the shelters as</v>

270
00:12:11.771 --> 00:12:14.290
<v Speaker 2>much as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the fact that there are these</v>

271
00:12:14.291 --> 00:12:17.980
<v Speaker 2>shelters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people kind of bottleneck to</v>

272
00:12:17.981 --> 00:12:22.450
<v Speaker 2>them because they know they're there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you will sometimes get to a shelter</v>

273
00:12:22.451 --> 00:12:25.870
<v Speaker 2>at night and it won't only be a t</v>
<v Speaker 2>through hikers there,</v>

274
00:12:25.871 --> 00:12:27.130
<v Speaker 2>there'll be people from town.</v>

275
00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:28.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they,</v>

276
00:12:28.961 --> 00:12:31.060
<v Speaker 2>I remember one time in Pennsylvania,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were these,</v>

277
00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.760
<v Speaker 2>there was this couple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

278
00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.860
<v Speaker 2>they were literally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was pouring rain.</v>

279
00:12:35.861 --> 00:12:36.910
<v Speaker 2>So we get there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

280
00:12:36.911 --> 00:12:39.490
<v Speaker 2>there's no way I'm camping out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no way I'm hiking on like I'm</v>

281
00:12:39.491 --> 00:12:40.750
<v Speaker 2>sleeping in the shelter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

282
00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:43.840
<v Speaker 2>I was drenched to the bone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my gear was drenched and I was pissed</v>

283
00:12:43.841 --> 00:12:45.400
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like a midnight,</v>

284
00:12:45.401 --> 00:12:46.420
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had been hiking all day.</v>

285
00:12:46.421 --> 00:12:48.370
<v Speaker 2>I was just exhausted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm so,</v>

286
00:12:48.371 --> 00:12:52.900
<v Speaker 2>so excited to get to the shelter and</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a couple and they are literally</v>

287
00:12:52.901 --> 00:12:54.130
<v Speaker 2>yelling at each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

288
00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.960
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can hear them for like a model,</v>

289
00:12:55.990 --> 00:13:00.130
<v Speaker 2>like just furiously yelling at each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other and you get there and they are.</v>

290
00:13:00.131 --> 00:13:02.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never really knew,</v>

291
00:13:02.021 --> 00:13:05.590
<v Speaker 2>but I'm assuming they were cracked out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw some little glass pieces going in</v>

292
00:13:05.591 --> 00:13:07.930
<v Speaker 2>between their hands and just the way</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're acting.</v>

293
00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
<v Speaker 2>He kept like throwing up his fists at or</v>
<v Speaker 2>he smashed a bottle on the wall in the</v>

294
00:13:13.001 --> 00:13:14.980
<v Speaker 2>shelter and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

295
00:13:14.981 --> 00:13:17.440
<v Speaker 2>he pulled out a knife at one point and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just like.</v>

296
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:21.610
<v Speaker 2>So are these individuals shelters or is</v>
<v Speaker 2>a large shelter when you see three</v>

297
00:13:21.611 --> 00:13:22.990
<v Speaker 2>walls?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like how big are these things?</v>

298
00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.180
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think they're usually maybe</v>

299
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:28.840
<v Speaker 2>about this size,</v>
<v Speaker 2>length of this table,</v>

300
00:13:28.841 --> 00:13:30.960
<v Speaker 2>maybe about 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 feet wide.</v>

301
00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:32.980
<v Speaker 2>And there's only one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like,</v>

302
00:13:33.010 --> 00:13:34.900
<v Speaker 2>you're supposed to share them with those</v>
<v Speaker 2>other people.</v>

303
00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:37.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're in there with these cracked</v>

304
00:13:37.251 --> 00:13:41.770
<v Speaker 2>out people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Luckily I had three other hiking buddies</v>

305
00:13:41.771 --> 00:13:45.910
<v Speaker 2>with me guys and the people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>granted they were aggressive towards</v>

306
00:13:45.911 --> 00:13:47.530
<v Speaker 2>each other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they didn't bother us.</v>

307
00:13:47.531 --> 00:13:49.510
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and like I think by like 4:00 AM,</v>

308
00:13:49.511 --> 00:13:51.720
<v Speaker 2>they hadn't gotten to sleep and we were</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>

309
00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:53.350
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you all please,</v>

310
00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:54.190
<v Speaker 2>please be quiet.</v>

311
00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:55.870
<v Speaker 2>Like I got to get some sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

312
00:13:55.871 --> 00:13:57.050
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

313
00:13:57.270 --> 00:13:59.170
<v Speaker 2>but that was the worst one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other than that,</v>

314
00:13:59.171 --> 00:14:02.650
<v Speaker 2>I think everything was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything was pretty safe.</v>

315
00:14:02.651 --> 00:14:04.960
<v Speaker 2>There's nothing too terrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did it play out?</v>

316
00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:07.180
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we left the next morning.</v>

317
00:14:07.210 --> 00:14:10.600
<v Speaker 2>And did they eventually go to sleep?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

318
00:14:10.601 --> 00:14:11.590
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't even remember.</v>

319
00:14:11.591 --> 00:14:14.380
<v Speaker 2>I think at 4:00 AM,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was so exhausted I was just like,</v>

320
00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:17.290
<v Speaker 2>they were still yelling at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just out,</v>

321
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:19.420
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was what they were yelling.</v>

322
00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.390
<v Speaker 2>I was just this one of those shelters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>

323
00:14:22.391 --> 00:14:25.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one of them was looking little</v>

324
00:14:25.361 --> 00:14:26.560
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's Kinda cool.</v>

325
00:14:26.561 --> 00:14:28.660
<v Speaker 2>It's all made out of logs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

326
00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:32.740
<v Speaker 2>it's got kind of a tin roof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that like a 10 sheet roof?</v>

327
00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:33.821
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

328
00:14:33.821 --> 00:14:35.620
<v Speaker 2>they vary a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you'll get all.</v>

329
00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:38.050
<v Speaker 2>Would you sometimes won't even get logs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

330
00:14:38.051 --> 00:14:39.760
<v Speaker 2>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can scroll up and see all the other</v>

331
00:14:39.870 --> 00:14:41.890
<v Speaker 2>ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those are for the hikers,</v>

332
00:14:42.220 --> 00:14:44.080
<v Speaker 2>is that what they're for?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

333
00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:45.880
<v Speaker 2>So that's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they've,</v>

334
00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:48.340
<v Speaker 2>they've anticipated,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's so many people that do this</v>

335
00:14:48.341 --> 00:14:51.980
<v Speaker 2>trail that they've made these shelters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've heard of</v>

336
00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.820
<v Speaker 1>these things in New Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

337
00:14:54.130 --> 00:14:55.040
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

338
00:14:55.041 --> 00:14:59.630
<v Speaker 1>they have them and they stock food in</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and they leave a log so that hikers</v>

339
00:14:59.631 --> 00:15:03.020
<v Speaker 1>can write down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my friend Remy,</v>

340
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.800
<v Speaker 1>Remy Warren was in New Zealand and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>used one of those and like wrote in the</v>

341
00:15:06.810 --> 00:15:07.581
<v Speaker 1>log,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

342
00:15:07.581 --> 00:15:12.410
<v Speaker 1>where he was from when he was there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I guess it also helps identify if</v>

343
00:15:12.411 --> 00:15:13.244
<v Speaker 1>people are missing.</v>

344
00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:14.661
<v Speaker 2>Exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

345
00:15:14.661 --> 00:15:16.590
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a safety precaution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if,</v>

346
00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:17.960
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can kind of track down where it was</v>

347
00:15:17.961 --> 00:15:19.550
<v Speaker 2>the last person seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

348
00:15:19.551 --> 00:15:21.290
<v Speaker 2>or wherever they last seen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if they were,</v>

349
00:15:21.580 --> 00:15:24.450
<v Speaker 2>if they logged into a shelter and then,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that there's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was not going to be an accountant know</v>

<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

402
00:17:40.721 --> 00:17:42.730
<v Speaker 2>I think I knew it was going to do some</v>
<v Speaker 2>transition.</v>

403
00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:44.440
<v Speaker 2>Try to get another job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do something.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm,</v>

<v Speaker 1>radical because it's so crazy.</v>

412
00:18:00.771 --> 00:18:05.771
<v Speaker 1>Committing to a six to seven month hike</v>
<v Speaker 1>was going to force you to just change</v>

413
00:18:08.090 --> 00:18:11.090
<v Speaker 1>existence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>change your frequency,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

416
00:18:13.491 --> 00:18:17.900
<v Speaker 1>you're wandering through the land</v>
<v Speaker 1>with all due respect.</v>

417
00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:22.730
<v Speaker 1>Thanks dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not a bad forever.</v>

418
00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:25.460
<v Speaker 1>Like my best friends are freaks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's,</v>

419
00:18:25.461 --> 00:18:27.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely a freak move,</v>

420
00:18:27.111 --> 00:18:27.910
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

421
00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:28.880
<v Speaker 2>no doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

422
00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:35.190
<v Speaker 1>well it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a very strange subset of human</v>

423
00:18:35.191 --> 00:18:38.890
<v Speaker 1>beings that don't not just drop out but</v>
<v Speaker 1>dropout.</v>

424
00:18:38.900 --> 00:18:39.391
<v Speaker 1>And I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

425
00:18:39.391 --> 00:18:42.340
<v Speaker 1>you're committing to something that is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

426
00:18:42.341 --> 00:18:44.160
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there ever a time we were like halfway</v>

427
00:18:44.161 --> 00:18:46.110
<v Speaker 1>there we like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe we just get a job in this fucking</v>

428
00:18:46.111 --> 00:18:46.944
<v Speaker 1>town.</v>

429
00:18:47.530 --> 00:18:49.050
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then some people did that,</v>

430
00:18:49.051 --> 00:18:50.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that was more for financial</v>

431
00:18:50.501 --> 00:18:51.251
<v Speaker 2>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

432
00:18:51.251 --> 00:18:54.550
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I gotta I gotta get some cash flow,</v>

433
00:18:54.910 --> 00:18:58.420
<v Speaker 2>but a no man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I definitely had kinda like a</v>

434
00:18:58.421 --> 00:19:00.820
<v Speaker 2>grind mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm gonna make it,</v>

435
00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:01.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to make it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

436
00:19:01.781 --> 00:19:04.780
<v Speaker 2>and I think that yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you go with a bunch of people</v>

437
00:19:06.370 --> 00:19:07.660
<v Speaker 2>know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

438
00:19:07.930 --> 00:19:12.930
<v Speaker 2>I think like 90 percent of hikers go on</v>
<v Speaker 2>eat alone and the fact that they're</v>

439
00:19:13.090 --> 00:19:15.280
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a lot of hikers out there,</v>

440
00:19:15.281 --> 00:19:18.310
<v Speaker 2>surprisingly particularly going north.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

441
00:19:18.311 --> 00:19:22.180
<v Speaker 2>I think maybe 2000 people try to go</v>
<v Speaker 2>north every year.</v>

442
00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.190
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you're hiking,</v>

443
00:19:24.670 --> 00:19:26.860
<v Speaker 1>there's like a gang of people on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>trail with you.</v>

444
00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:28.440
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you go south,</v>

445
00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:29.293
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

446
00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:32.200
<v Speaker 2>it changes every year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but 10 to 15 percent of people that hike</v>

447
00:19:32.201 --> 00:19:34.740
<v Speaker 2>the Antigo self,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like you're going to have much less</v>

448
00:19:34.741 --> 00:19:36.360
<v Speaker 2>social circles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stuff like that.</v>

449
00:19:36.361 --> 00:19:37.290
<v Speaker 2>But in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

450
00:19:37.291 --> 00:19:39.450
<v Speaker 2>people are hiking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>running like you're gonna meet people,</v>

451
00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:42.060
<v Speaker 2>you're talking about the shelters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you're going to stumble into people</v>

452
00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:44.130
<v Speaker 2>walking by,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to meet them in town,</v>

453
00:19:44.131 --> 00:19:47.220
<v Speaker 2>you're gonna meet him at the shelters</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they become your buddies.</v>

454
00:19:47.221 --> 00:19:48.054
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

455

457
00:19:54.091 --> 00:19:57.120
<v Speaker 2>people and hiked with them for a couple</v>
<v Speaker 2>of weeks and then,</v>

458
00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:59.700
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different paces.</v>

00:20:21.781 --> 00:20:23.310
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eric Rudolph didn't.</v>

469
00:20:23.311 --> 00:20:28.311
<v Speaker 2>He ran out and eat and like he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was hiding out there for a long time.</v>

470
00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:31.840
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was like the unabomber.</v>

471
00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:32.311
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

472
00:20:32.311 --> 00:20:32.950
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

473
00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:35.800
<v Speaker 1>that's not the unabomber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The unabomber is Ted Kaczynski.</v>

474
00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:38.530
<v Speaker 1>He's that guy that was in the park</v>
<v Speaker 1>bomber.</v>

475
00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:39.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

476
00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:43.040
<v Speaker 2>So I believe it was Eric Rudolph was</v>
<v Speaker 2>found in a dumpster in North Carolina.</v>

477
00:20:43.041 --> 00:20:45.880
<v Speaker 2>He had been hiding out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like full on hiker,</v>

478
00:20:45.890 --> 00:20:47.380
<v Speaker 2>homeless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

479
00:20:47.620 --> 00:20:49.300
<v Speaker 2>beard grown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But he had been,</v>

480
00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:51.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hiding out on a t,</v>

481
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:54.310
<v Speaker 1>it seems like that would be a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>play,</v>

482
00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.940
<v Speaker 1>a place where a lot of people get robbed</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you'd know that you have money</v>

483
00:20:57.941 --> 00:20:59.920
<v Speaker 1>on you because you have to make this</v>
<v Speaker 1>trail,</v>

484
00:20:59.980 --> 00:21:02.830
<v Speaker 1>you have to have some cash to buy food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And</v>

485
00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:05.840
<v Speaker 2>I never heard anything bad like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

486
00:21:05.841 --> 00:21:06.830
<v Speaker 2>Honestly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know that they're,</v>

487
00:21:06.831 --> 00:21:10.280
<v Speaker 2>there have been a few murders on the 80.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

488
00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:12.530
<v Speaker 2>But you think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about any given city,</v>

489
00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:13.400
<v Speaker 2>the murder rate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

490
00:21:13.401 --> 00:21:16.520
<v Speaker 2>it's like if you have 2000 through</v>
<v Speaker 2>hikers plus,</v>

491
00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:21.080
<v Speaker 2>I mean 100,000 weakened hikers a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean more than that,</v>

492
00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:24.080
<v Speaker 2>it's like the probability,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think about the 80 hikers as a</v>

493
00:21:24.081 --> 00:21:26.810
<v Speaker 2>city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a murder every few years,</v>

494
00:21:26.811 --> 00:21:28.730
<v Speaker 2>really it and in bed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

495
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:32.020
<v Speaker 1>that's the same logic that they use for</v>
<v Speaker 1>those um,</v>

496
00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:35.850
<v Speaker 1>foxconn buildings where the people jump</v>
<v Speaker 1>off the buildings where they're making</v>

497
00:21:35.851 --> 00:21:37.830
<v Speaker 1>cell phones in China that go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

498
00:21:37.831 --> 00:21:39.690
<v Speaker 1>you've got to think about how many</v>
<v Speaker 1>people work here.</v>

499
00:21:39.691 --> 00:21:41.080
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you'd kill themselves,</v>

500
00:21:41.081 --> 00:21:42.780
<v Speaker 1>it's just a game of numbers at that</v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

501
00:21:42.781 --> 00:21:43.340
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody,</v>

502
00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:45.120
<v Speaker 1>somebody's going to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess it is.</v>

503
00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:48.080
<v Speaker 1>So will you ever there when any of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>went down?</v>

504
00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:49.110
<v Speaker 1>They were looking for a murder.</v>

505
00:21:49.230 --> 00:21:52.070
<v Speaker 2>Know there was a famous case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

506
00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.000
<v Speaker 2>I forgot her name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her hiker name.</v>

507
00:21:55.650 --> 00:21:59.990
<v Speaker 2>Hold on her name flower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

508
00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.550

<v Speaker 2>That's go to trail name.</v>

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:20.920

537
00:23:20.921 --> 00:23:22.320
<v Speaker 1>legs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how,</v>

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:24.010
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never have,</v>

539
00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:27.640
<v Speaker 1>I've shaved some body parts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've shaped my butt.</v>

540
00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:29.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ladies and Gentlemen,</v>

541
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:32.950
<v Speaker 1>I've shaved my butthole a two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps three times.</v>

542
00:23:32.951 --> 00:23:34.990
<v Speaker 1>I just had this conversation with</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone about this the other day</v>

543
00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:36.190
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

544
00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:36.970
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

545
00:23:36.970 --> 00:23:38.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm Harry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a hairy dude other than the top of</v>

546
00:23:38.831 --> 00:23:40.180
<v Speaker 1>my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

547
00:23:40.290 --> 00:23:45.070
<v Speaker 1>I get hairy and so it's not the best for</v>
<v Speaker 1>like keeping clean.</v>

548
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:48.640
<v Speaker 1>So one day I was shaving my package and</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

549
00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:51.200
<v Speaker 1>let's just get crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go all the way down there,</v>

550
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:53.570
<v Speaker 1>finish it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I did.</v>

551
00:23:53.571 --> 00:23:57.440
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things I was shocked was</v>
<v Speaker 1>it changes the sound of your farts.</v>

552
00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.710
<v Speaker 1>Did we talk about this on the podcast</v>
<v Speaker 1>before?</v>

553
00:24:00.711 --> 00:24:03.220
<v Speaker 1>I've heard it discussed on another</v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast I talked about,</v>

554
00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.073
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

555
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:06.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It changes the sound of your farts.</v>

556
00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:09.070
<v Speaker 1>They become more duck like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

557
00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:13.280
<v Speaker 1>It's like something about your butt hair</v>
<v Speaker 1>that muffles not that's the biggest</v>

558
00:24:13.281 --> 00:24:15.250
<v Speaker 1>issue in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm also,</v>

559
00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.150
<v Speaker 1>when they grow back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quite unpleasant.</v>

560
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:20.390
<v Speaker 1>The grow back process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the itching and stuff,</v>

561
00:24:20.391 --> 00:24:23.050
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something that happens when your</v>

562
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:25.820
<v Speaker 1>hair starts growing back when you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

563
00:24:25.821 --> 00:24:27.980
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think of this.</v>

564
00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:29.500
<v Speaker 1>This isn't what I signed up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

565
00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.940
<v Speaker 1>But that's where I end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't go through the legs,</v>

566
00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.280
<v Speaker 1>but I'm not opposed to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not.</v>

567
00:24:34.910 --> 00:24:39.910
<v Speaker 1>It seems to me like there's a problem</v>
<v Speaker 1>with why it's an issue,</v>

568
00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.140
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like why is it an issue?</v>

569
00:24:42.430 --> 00:24:44.090
<v Speaker 1>But I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something about,</v>

570
00:24:44.091 --> 00:24:46.700
<v Speaker 1>is it a sexuality thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Taboo?</v>

571
00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:47.291
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

572
00:24:47.291 --> 00:24:50.180
<v Speaker 1>why bring it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring it back to why is it okay to shave</v>

573
00:24:50.181 --> 00:24:52.520
<v Speaker 1>your head?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is it okay to shave your face?</v>

574
00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:56.840
<v Speaker 1>So get to shave all sorts and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you start shaving your armpits,</v>

575
00:24:56.900 --> 00:24:58.340
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dudes that shave their armpits,</v>

576
00:24:58.341 --> 00:24:59.174
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>armpits.</v>

580
00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:09.860
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong with shaving your armpits?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is something though.</v>

581
00:25:10.010 --> 00:25:12.200
<v Speaker 1>If your friend yawned and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey dude,</v>

00:25:17.301 --> 00:25:20.470
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she makes armpits weird flux of doing</v>

585
00:25:20.490 --> 00:25:21.440
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

586
00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:23.720
<v Speaker 1>I know dudes that shave their legs</v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

587
00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:25.580
<v Speaker 1>but they're like super into fitness and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

588
00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:27.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be like as you want your</v>

589
00:25:27.471 --> 00:25:28.291
<v Speaker 1>legs look good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

590
00:25:28.291 --> 00:25:29.001
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

591
00:25:29.001 --> 00:25:30.470
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to like big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sloppy,</v>

592
00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:34.640
<v Speaker 1>fucked up looking legs that are shaved</v>
<v Speaker 1>also.</v>

593
00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:37.280
<v Speaker 1>Then you let highlight like if you have</v>
<v Speaker 1>like these big,</v>

594
00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:41.120
<v Speaker 1>like blocky tree trunk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sloppy legs,</v>

595
00:25:41.150 --> 00:25:43.880
<v Speaker 1>you'd want to keep them Harry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That he looked like some sort of a bear,</v>

596
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:45.303
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

597
00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:52.040
<v Speaker 1>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

598
00:25:53.871 --> 00:25:54.870
<v Speaker 1>There's something about like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.050
<v Speaker 1>here's another thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shave your eyebrows.</v>

600
00:25:57.200 --> 00:26:00.550
<v Speaker 1>You shave your eyebrows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like who the fuck shaved their eyebrows.</v>

601
00:26:00.551 --> 00:26:01.970
<v Speaker 1>It's weird,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

602
00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:06.230
<v Speaker 1>If you decide to shave your eyebrows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people gonna just go.</v>

603
00:26:06.231 --> 00:26:08.030
<v Speaker 1>You one of those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

604
00:26:08.031 --> 00:26:10.400
<v Speaker 1>just a couple inches south.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Shave your mustache.</v>

605
00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:11.950
<v Speaker 1>Nobody gives a shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally normal.</v>

606
00:26:12.060 --> 00:26:14.750
<v Speaker 1>Seemed totally normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something about shaving those</v>

607
00:26:14.751 --> 00:26:16.190
<v Speaker 1>eyebrows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

608
00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:18.710
<v Speaker 1>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

609
00:26:18.770 --> 00:26:21.710
<v Speaker 1>Or if you left your mustache and shaved</v>
<v Speaker 1>your eyebrows,</v>

610
00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:24.470
<v Speaker 1>get the fuck away from me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kind of a Weirdo.</v>

611
00:26:24.471 --> 00:26:26.600
<v Speaker 1>Are you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have weird rules.</v>

612
00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:29.720
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the weirdest name that you</v>

613
00:26:29.721 --> 00:26:34.180
<v Speaker 1>heard anybody get other than smooth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where to begin?</v>

614
00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:36.100
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fart master.</v>

615
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:40.190
<v Speaker 1>I think that it's pretty self</v>
<v Speaker 1>explanatory how it got that one.</v>

616
00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:42.800
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of my favorites was I got a buddy of</v>

617
00:26:42.801 --> 00:26:44.260
<v Speaker 1>mine hiked with for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name was hover</v>

618
00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:46.440
<v Speaker 2>job hovered,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hovered job.</v>

619
00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:47.710
<v Speaker 2>He went to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

620
00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:52.530
<v Speaker 2>when you get out of it and it's like</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people aren't even that familiar</v>

621
00:26:52.531 --> 00:26:53.400
<v Speaker 2>with the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

622
00:26:53.401 --> 00:26:57.690
<v Speaker 2>So you start trying to figure out tips</v>
<v Speaker 2>and tricks on how to do things.</v>

623
00:26:57.691 --> 00:27:01.280
<v Speaker 2>So one of the things is how to use the</v>
<v Speaker 2>public facilities and uh,</v>

624
00:27:01.290 --> 00:27:02.220
<v Speaker 2>he was saying he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

625
00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:04.350
<v Speaker 2>he does the hover job.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

626
00:27:04.351 --> 00:27:05.580
<v Speaker 2>That's a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

627
00:27:05.581 --> 00:27:06.990
<v Speaker 2>Everybody knows that one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

628
00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.660
<v Speaker 2>We stopped at some gas station somewhere</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you gotta take a shit.</v>

629
00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.220
<v Speaker 2>You have to be really careful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

630
00:27:11.221 --> 00:27:12.930
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to test the sets that</v>
<v Speaker 2>sleep.</v>

631
00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:14.250
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking of ticks,</v>

632
00:27:14.251 --> 00:27:15.900
<v Speaker 2>you were talking about ticks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

633
00:27:15.901 --> 00:27:18.630
<v Speaker 2>I know lyme disease is a huge issue on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the east coast.</v>

634
00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:21.660
<v Speaker 2>I saw something nearly day that was</v>
<v Speaker 2>saying this year is going to be a record</v>

635
00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:24.940
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some walnut hatching season something</v>

636
00:27:24.941 --> 00:27:27.390
<v Speaker 2>and I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was terrifying stuff.</v>

637
00:27:27.930 --> 00:27:31.170
<v Speaker 2>I did this show back a while back on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cipher.</v>

638
00:27:31.171 --> 00:27:33.240
<v Speaker 2>I called Joe Rogan questions everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the,</v>

639
00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:36.720
<v Speaker 2>one of the things we talked about was</v>
<v Speaker 2>mostly conspiracy theories and it was</v>

640
00:27:36.721 --> 00:27:41.050
<v Speaker 2>really interesting to find the mindset</v>
<v Speaker 2>of these conspiracy people and how</v>

641
00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:44.510
<v Speaker 2>they're all very similar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's big foot or aliens or what.</v>

642
00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:49.830
<v Speaker 1>They're really similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of bizarre mindset that the way</v>

643
00:27:50.501 --> 00:27:53.380
<v Speaker 1>they look at things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they hit this very compartmentalized,</v>

644
00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:57.010
<v Speaker 1>fucked up way of looking at things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the ones that we studied that</v>

645
00:27:57.011 --> 00:27:59.510
<v Speaker 1>was really fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something called more Jaylen's,</v>

646
00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:03.820
<v Speaker 1>more gentleman's is a weird disease</v>
<v Speaker 1>where people believe that they have</v>

647
00:28:03.850 --> 00:28:08.410
<v Speaker 1>these fibers growing out of their skin</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they start itching themselves and</v>

648
00:28:08.411 --> 00:28:11.080
<v Speaker 1>they create these like lead Gen z</v>
<v Speaker 1>scratches.</v>

649
00:28:11.290 --> 00:28:16.090
<v Speaker 1>And then things get attached to them</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fibers from like perhaps from a</v>

650
00:28:16.091 --> 00:28:18.430
<v Speaker 1>carpet or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they think that they're growing out</v>

651
00:28:18.431 --> 00:28:21.070
<v Speaker 1>of their skin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most people think it's a</v>

652
00:28:21.071 --> 00:28:24.460
<v Speaker 1>psychosomatic disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one of the guys that I talked to was</v>

653
00:28:24.461 --> 00:28:29.461
<v Speaker 1>a doctor who also had more Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he was really a very objective about</v>

654
00:28:31.391 --> 00:28:34.600
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he said there seems to be some sort</v>

655
00:28:34.810 --> 00:28:36.650
<v Speaker 1>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

656
00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:42.210
<v Speaker 1>neurotoxic effect that's connected to</v>
<v Speaker 1>lyme disease.</v>

657
00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.980
<v Speaker 1>And he said that one of the things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people that have more gentleman's</v>

658
00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.160
<v Speaker 1>have in common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they almost all have lyme disease.</v>

659
00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:53.410
<v Speaker 1>And what he believes is that ticks</v>
<v Speaker 1>contain not just lyme disease,</v>

660
00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:57.320
<v Speaker 1>but a host of other different sort of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

661
00:28:57.910 --> 00:29:02.910
<v Speaker 1>diseases that you can catch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so because of these weird different</v>

662
00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:08.650
<v Speaker 1>bacterias and different things that</v>
<v Speaker 1>these toxins that these ticks</v>

663
00:29:08.651 --> 00:29:13.360
<v Speaker 1>potentially possess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you get bit by certain ticks,</v>

664
00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:16.530
<v Speaker 1>you can actually hallucinate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And he would say,</v>

665
00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:19.330
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about and we saw a thread</v>

666
00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.430
<v Speaker 1>moving across his eyeball.</v>

667
00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:22.980
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is real stuff.</v>

668
00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:24.120
<v Speaker 2>That's of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

669
00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:24.331
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

670
00:29:24.331 --> 00:29:25.560
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not sy stuff at all.</v>

671
00:29:25.561 --> 00:29:27.430
<v Speaker 2>It's real.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People never even heard of this.</v>

672
00:29:28.570 --> 00:29:30.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's generally thought to be a</v>

673
00:29:30.661 --> 00:29:33.000
<v Speaker 1>psychosomatic disorder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's why it was interesting</v>

674
00:29:33.001 --> 00:29:37.320
<v Speaker 1>talking to this doctor because he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying yes and no because he was saying,</v>

675
00:29:37.321 --> 00:29:39.420
<v Speaker 1>well there isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He believes there's a real issue and</v>

676
00:29:39.421 --> 00:29:43.600
<v Speaker 1>that issue is lyme disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that these pathogens that are in</v>

677
00:29:43.601 --> 00:29:45.070
<v Speaker 1>these ticks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

678
00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:46.000
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not,</v>

679
00:29:46.001 --> 00:29:48.340
<v Speaker 1>it's not uniform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are different in all these</v>

680
00:29:48.341 --> 00:29:50.890
<v Speaker 1>different ticks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them are more potent than others</v>

681
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:54.920
<v Speaker 1>and that there may be a host of</v>
<v Speaker 1>different unidentified pathogenesis.</v>

682
00:29:54.940 --> 00:29:57.250
<v Speaker 1>There's not just lyme disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but several others.</v>

683
00:29:57.430 --> 00:30:01.930
<v Speaker 1>And some of them have a neurotoxic</v>
<v Speaker 1>effect and this neurotoxic effect can</v>

684
00:30:01.931 --> 00:30:05.440
<v Speaker 1>induce hallucinations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some of those hallucinations can be</v>

685
00:30:05.441 --> 00:30:08.440
<v Speaker 1>that you think that your body's growing</v>
<v Speaker 1>fibers out of it.</v>

686
00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:10.810
<v Speaker 1>And he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said that he saw it moving across.</v>

687
00:30:10.811 --> 00:30:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Is it he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know intellectually that it was not</v>

688
00:30:13.541 --> 00:30:14.140
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

689
00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:15.100
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no,</v>

690
00:30:15.101 --> 00:30:17.530
<v Speaker 1>I examined it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked at it was not there,</v>

691
00:30:17.531 --> 00:30:20.620
<v Speaker 1>but I saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that he personally experienced the</v>

692
00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:22.210
<v Speaker 1>notion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

693
00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:23.920
<v Speaker 1>And the other thing is a lot of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

694
00:30:23.921 --> 00:30:28.810
<v Speaker 1>they go undiagnosed for long periods of</v>
<v Speaker 1>time because for the longest time a lyme</v>

695
00:30:28.811 --> 00:30:32.290
<v Speaker 1>disease went undiagnosed and still does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have a good buddy of mine,</v>

696
00:30:32.291 --> 00:30:36.850
<v Speaker 1>him and his son got bit by ticks when</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were fishing.</v>

697
00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:39.610
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he brought his son to the doctor.</v>

698
00:30:39.611 --> 00:30:41.380
<v Speaker 1>And by then that bullseye,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

699
00:30:41.381 --> 00:30:44.650
<v Speaker 1>around that grows or if you get bit by a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tick that has lyme disease,</v>

700
00:30:44.651 --> 00:30:48.310
<v Speaker 1>there's like a bullseye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like the red circle that grows</v>

701
00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:51.570
<v Speaker 1>around the area where the tick bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>him and the Bulls.</v>

702
00:30:51.571 --> 00:30:53.800
<v Speaker 1>I had gone away by the time he brought</v>
<v Speaker 1>him to the doctor.</v>

703
00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:55.630
<v Speaker 1>So the doctor was incredulous and he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

704
00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:56.050
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

705
00:30:56.050 --> 00:30:57.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe that's lyme disease.</v>

706
00:30:57.100 --> 00:30:59.770
<v Speaker 1>Kids from refined and then he started</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting bell's Palsy.</v>

707
00:30:59.771 --> 00:31:03.290
<v Speaker 1>So half of his face was paralyzed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when they really realized that</v>

708
00:31:03.291 --> 00:31:03.851
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

709
00:31:03.851 --> 00:31:06.420
<v Speaker 1>this kid has lyme disease for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then yeah.</v>

710
00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:08.530
<v Speaker 1>And they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were in real bad shape.</v>

711
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:12.670
<v Speaker 1>Like my friend who was skinny as it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wound up losing something like 20,</v>

712
00:31:12.671 --> 00:31:16.750
<v Speaker 1>30 pounds and it fucked with him for</v>
<v Speaker 1>close to a year.</v>

713
00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.460
<v Speaker 1>The other guys that he was with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

714
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:21.640
<v Speaker 1>they got lyme disease as well as several</v>
<v Speaker 1>people that were with got lyme disease</v>

715
00:31:21.641 --> 00:31:26.641
<v Speaker 1>and they were all fucked up for months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew one guy that got it and I think</v>

716
00:31:28.121 --> 00:31:31.150
<v Speaker 1>he went to the doctor and got some shots</v>
<v Speaker 1>or antibiotics.</v>

717
00:31:31.151 --> 00:31:33.910
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what the treatment was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he came back like full force and</v>

718
00:31:33.911 --> 00:31:35.100
<v Speaker 1>finished the two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

719
00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:37.750
<v Speaker 1>you can't do that if you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get catch it,</v>

720
00:31:37.751 --> 00:31:38.680
<v Speaker 1>like really clearly.</v>

721
00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:40.690
<v Speaker 1>We had a guy on the podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve,</v>

722
00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:42.940
<v Speaker 1>Steve Kotler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who got it,</v>

723
00:31:42.941 --> 00:31:47.080
<v Speaker 1>and he was undiagnosed for over a year</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he wound up being bedridden for</v>

724
00:31:47.081 --> 00:31:49.720
<v Speaker 1>three years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my gosh.</v>

725
00:31:49.721 --> 00:31:50.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

726
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:53.020
<v Speaker 1>Because the more it sinks into your</v>
<v Speaker 1>system,</v>

727
00:31:53.410 --> 00:31:57.280
<v Speaker 1>the more you let it go or without</v>
<v Speaker 1>antibiotics,</v>

728
00:31:57.281 --> 00:31:59.260
<v Speaker 1>without treatment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

729
00:31:59.670 --> 00:32:03.460
<v Speaker 1>with this doctor was telling me just</v>
<v Speaker 1>relaying what this one doctor who had</v>

730
00:32:03.461 --> 00:32:06.820
<v Speaker 1>lyme disease was saying is that he</v>
<v Speaker 1>believes that there's a host of</v>

731
00:32:06.821 --> 00:32:09.390
<v Speaker 1>different pathogens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not just one and he,</v>

732
00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:12.100
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said there could be many that are</v>

733
00:32:12.101 --> 00:32:15.490
<v Speaker 1>undiscovered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like lyme disease is fairly recent in</v>

734
00:32:15.491 --> 00:32:18.460
<v Speaker 1>terms of its discovery or our diagnosis</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>

735
00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:21.820
<v Speaker 1>I feel like it's within the last two or</v>
<v Speaker 1>three decades at the most,</v>

736
00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:25.750
<v Speaker 1>so I would worry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're out there.</v>

737
00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:29.050
<v Speaker 1>The risk of the lyme disease on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Appalachian trail is going to be high</v>

738
00:32:29.051 --> 00:32:30.580
<v Speaker 1>this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trail life.</v>

739
00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:33.250
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you retrain life when you're out</v>

740
00:32:33.251 --> 00:32:34.140
<v Speaker 1>there?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't even have started.</v>

741
00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:35.260
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just came out today though.</v>

742
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:37.780
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're talking about touching.</v>

743
00:32:38.130 --> 00:32:40.220
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was another</v>

744
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:44.360
<v Speaker 2>article and I googled lyme disease from</v>
<v Speaker 2>Connecticut that says that the testing</v>

745
00:32:44.361 --> 00:32:47.240
<v Speaker 2>on found ticks with lyme disease is</v>
<v Speaker 2>higher this year,</v>

746
00:32:47.241 --> 00:32:50.220
<v Speaker 2>more than normal for last year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And repeat,</v>

747
00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:52.000
<v Speaker 2>you get bitten when you go</v>

748
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:53.240
<v Speaker 1>flooding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can,</v>

749
00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:54.980
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm really careful,</v>

750
00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:58.670
<v Speaker 1>real careful to check myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also real careful to keep myself covered</v>

751
00:32:58.671 --> 00:32:59.560
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

752
00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:01.310
<v Speaker 1>I wear gators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wear,</v>

753
00:33:01.311 --> 00:33:02.300
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

754
00:33:02.301 --> 00:33:05.780
<v Speaker 1>a long,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a Merino wool that goes all the way</v>

755
00:33:05.781 --> 00:33:09.260
<v Speaker 1>down to my ankles and then I pull the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Merino wool socks way up over that.</v>

756
00:33:09.261 --> 00:33:13.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any exposed up to my wrists</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I even wore gloves sometimes even in</v>

757
00:33:13.461 --> 00:33:17.420
<v Speaker 1>the heat aware,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a thin layer glove just to all also</v>

758
00:33:17.421 --> 00:33:21.650
<v Speaker 1>it's good to protect your hands from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>sun but also to protect your hands from</v>

759
00:33:21.651 --> 00:33:24.610
<v Speaker 1>the animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seeing that white skin like you want a</v>

760
00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:28.590
<v Speaker 1>little white as you can that's exposed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>

761
00:33:28.790 --> 00:33:33.170
<v Speaker 1>I think about that primarily about ticks</v>
<v Speaker 1>scares the shit out of me.</v>

762
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:33.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

763
00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:35.190
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what percentage of ticks</v>

764
00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:38.450
<v Speaker 2>actually carry because I feel like I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably been bitten by ticks in my</v>

765
00:33:38.451 --> 00:33:39.280
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

766
00:33:39.280 --> 00:33:40.113
<v Speaker 2>some like,</v>

767
00:33:40.590 --> 00:33:44.430
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what percent of the job I</v>
<v Speaker 1>got bit by a bunch when I was a kid,</v>

768
00:33:44.690 --> 00:33:47.670
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I never got line but wasn't around</v>

769
00:33:47.671 --> 00:33:51.150
<v Speaker 1>that much when I was a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a thing about the New York</v>

770
00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:55.470
<v Speaker 1>upper New York state area being</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbelievably infested.</v>

771
00:33:55.650 --> 00:34:00.010
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen a lyme disease map?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a map of lyme disease infestation</v>

772
00:34:00.011 --> 00:34:01.920
<v Speaker 1>in the northeast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big time and this huge,</v>

773
00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:04.950
<v Speaker 1>huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge in the northeast and huge in New</v>

774
00:34:04.950 --> 00:34:08.520
<v Speaker 1>York state like that upper New York</v>
<v Speaker 1>state area.</v>

775
00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.190
<v Speaker 1>Just really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really devastating.</v>

776
00:34:11.250 --> 00:34:13.040
<v Speaker 1>I wonder whether that isn't related to</v>
<v Speaker 1>most.</v>

777
00:34:13.590 --> 00:34:14.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deer,</v>

778
00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:15.510
<v Speaker 1>deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deer,</v>

779
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:17.460
<v Speaker 1>deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ticks apparently are a big issue.</v>

780
00:34:18.090 --> 00:34:18.990
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

781
00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:20.600
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

782
00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:23.850
<v Speaker 1>it's the 2015,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a few in California,</v>

783
00:34:23.851 --> 00:34:26.250
<v Speaker 1>especially northern California has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bunch,</v>

784
00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:30.990
<v Speaker 1>but look at that fucking ne Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just like a Zombie plague.</v>

785
00:34:31.380 --> 00:34:33.900
<v Speaker 1>That's awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts is completely covered in</v>

786
00:34:33.901 --> 00:34:34.734
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at it.</v>

787
00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:37.620
<v Speaker 1>The whole street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey to covered.</v>

788
00:34:38.070 --> 00:34:43.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just a devastating disease if</v>

789
00:34:43.021 --> 00:34:45.870
<v Speaker 1>you don't catch it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but guess it's spreading across the</v>

790
00:34:45.871 --> 00:34:47.970
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're finding it in Florida now,</v>

791
00:34:47.971 --> 00:34:52.860
<v Speaker 1>new strains in Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What other issues do you have to deal</v>

792
00:34:52.861 --> 00:34:56.160
<v Speaker 1>with when it comes to like bugs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>diseases and stuff like that?</v>

793
00:34:56.530 --> 00:34:57.363
<v Speaker 1>Grd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

794
00:34:57.450 --> 00:34:58.680
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what.</v>

795
00:34:58.681 --> 00:34:59.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was gonna ask you that.</v>

796
00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:01.890
<v Speaker 1>How do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you get your water?</v>

797
00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:02.753
<v Speaker 1>Like what are you getting?</v>

798
00:35:05.140 --> 00:35:06.480
<v Speaker 2>There's a thing called,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

799
00:35:07.170 --> 00:35:10.500
<v Speaker 2>basically you all freshwater water</v>
<v Speaker 2>sources,</v>

800
00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:12.420
<v Speaker 2>so streams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lakes,</v>

801
00:35:12.421 --> 00:35:13.480
<v Speaker 2>ponds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

802
00:35:13.500 --> 00:35:16.080
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately the east coast is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's so wet,</v>

803
00:35:16.081 --> 00:35:19.050
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to crossover water source</v>

804
00:35:19.051 --> 00:35:21.840
<v Speaker 2>very frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Generally several times a day you're</v>

805
00:35:21.841 --> 00:35:24.630
<v Speaker 2>going to cross at least a stream.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you fill up your water there.</v>

806
00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:27.720
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you carry two different containers to</v>

807
00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:30.150
<v Speaker 2>two bottles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one for dirty,</v>

808
00:35:30.151 --> 00:35:31.710
<v Speaker 2>one for clean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

809
00:35:31.711 --> 00:35:34.530
<v Speaker 2>so you fill up a leader of nerdy water</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the stream.</v>

810
00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:39.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm a ton of different water methods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you do it in your back</v>

811
00:35:39.301 --> 00:35:40.920
<v Speaker 2>country hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>

812
00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:43.770
<v Speaker 2>the big one I use with saw your squeeze.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a,</v>

813
00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:45.930
<v Speaker 2>a nozzle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You screw on top of your,</v>

814
00:35:45.931 --> 00:35:47.640
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your water bottles he feel but dirty</v>

815
00:35:47.641 --> 00:35:51.240
<v Speaker 2>water bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Screw this water filter off and you</v>

816
00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:53.940
<v Speaker 2>squeeze out clean water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's what I used.</v>

817
00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:56.190
<v Speaker 2>But I mean a lot of really works that</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

818
00:35:56.290 --> 00:35:58.560
<v Speaker 2>You just squeeze it in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The water comes out clean.</v>

819
00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:00.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The filtration system,</v>

820
00:36:00.331 --> 00:36:01.650
<v Speaker 2>is that good?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

821
00:36:01.830 --> 00:36:05.490
<v Speaker 2>And it takes out Giardia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

822
00:36:05.491 --> 00:36:09.960
<v Speaker 2>I think that kind of still standing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

823
00:36:09.961 --> 00:36:12.300
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then they're like the droplets which</v>

824
00:36:12.301 --> 00:36:15.390
<v Speaker 2>are basically a Columbian chemicals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

825
00:36:15.391 --> 00:36:17.040
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

826
00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:17.821
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

827
00:36:17.821 --> 00:36:20.580
<v Speaker 2>what else is there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All sorts of filters and chemicals.</v>

828
00:36:20.581 --> 00:36:22.500
<v Speaker 2>Some people try to boil it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's just a pain.</v>

829
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:25.650
<v Speaker 2>You don't want to boil water all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time and then wait for it to cool down</v>

830
00:36:25.651 --> 00:36:26.580
<v Speaker 2>before you get drink it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

831
00:36:26.581 --> 00:36:28.170
<v Speaker 2>I will say though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the end of the,</v>

832
00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:31.430
<v Speaker 2>you talk about finishing and winter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

833
00:36:31.470 --> 00:36:33.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like whenever you stop at these</v>

834
00:36:33.150 --> 00:36:34.200
<v Speaker 2>freshwater sources,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

835
00:36:34.201 --> 00:36:37.020
<v Speaker 2>the water's flowing and I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

836
00:36:37.021 --> 00:36:39.480
<v Speaker 2>it's like 20 degrees out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 degrees,</v>

837
00:36:39.481 --> 00:36:39.991
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

838
00:36:39.991 --> 00:36:44.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to stick my hand in that</v>
<v Speaker 2>freezing water and get my hands cold.</v>

839
00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:45.870
<v Speaker 2>I can't hit them back up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

840
00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:47.580
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I'll,</v>

841
00:36:47.581 --> 00:36:50.010
<v Speaker 2>it admittedly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not that I recommend this,</v>

842
00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:52.110
<v Speaker 2>but I was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was drinking it straight,</v>

843
00:36:52.111 --> 00:36:53.230
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

844
00:36:53.570 --> 00:36:54.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's risky.</v>

845
00:36:54.870 --> 00:36:57.450
<v Speaker 2>It was risky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was just like I was so done by</v>

846
00:36:57.451 --> 00:36:58.171
<v Speaker 2>the end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

847
00:36:58.171 --> 00:37:02.460
<v Speaker 2>it's just like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't have the patients to stop with</v>

848
00:37:02.461 --> 00:37:03.690
<v Speaker 2>freezing fingers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

849
00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:04.650
<v Speaker 2>so numb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

850
00:37:04.651 --> 00:37:07.220
<v Speaker 2>the dexterity is just totally gone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

851
00:37:07.290 --> 00:37:11.250
<v Speaker 2>I'm like was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

852
00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:14.560
<v Speaker 2>So I'll see a doctor eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

853
00:37:15.570 --> 00:37:19.260
<v Speaker 2>now when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you got to the end seven months,</v>

854
00:37:19.350 --> 00:37:21.330
<v Speaker 2>is that what it took you?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was,</v>

855
00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:25.140
<v Speaker 2>I got up trail for two weeks in between</v>
<v Speaker 2>there for some family stuff.</v>

856
00:37:25.141 --> 00:37:27.840
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you took out that two weeks,</v>

857
00:37:27.841 --> 00:37:29.730
<v Speaker 2>it was six months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was on trail.</v>

858
00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:33.090
<v Speaker 2>So when you get off trail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you go fly somewhere?</v>

859
00:37:33.690 --> 00:37:35.640
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went to France with my family.</v>

860
00:37:35.880 --> 00:37:36.770
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not,</v>

861
00:37:36.890 --> 00:37:38.400
<v Speaker 2>doesn't count dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

862
00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:39.850
<v Speaker 2>And it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

863
00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:43.260
<v Speaker 2>just a human trash can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just like cheese,</v>

864
00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:45.600
<v Speaker 2>wine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that I like I gained.</v>

865
00:37:45.930 --> 00:37:48.660
<v Speaker 2>I gained at least five,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 pounds that week and I was just like,</v>

866
00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:53.290
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just pigging out showing joint the</v>

867
00:37:53.330 --> 00:37:54.780
<v Speaker 2>shuttle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That vacation though.</v>

868
00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:56.670
<v Speaker 2>It was Kinda like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

869
00:37:56.671 --> 00:37:58.160
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of guys are getting up jokes.</v>

870
00:37:58.170 --> 00:37:59.003
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

871
00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:00.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm totally broken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything,</v>

872
00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:03.060
<v Speaker 2>like I'm going to France for a week or</v>
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>

873
00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.500
<v Speaker 2>So some people get off trail just</v>
<v Speaker 2>because financially they can't hack it</v>

874
00:38:07.501 --> 00:38:08.281
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

875
00:38:08.281 --> 00:38:11.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean you got a 19 year old guy who's</v>
<v Speaker 2>at a high school.</v>

876
00:38:11.641 --> 00:38:12.870
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have any savings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

877
00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:13.780
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go ahead with a two.</v>

878
00:38:13.781 --> 00:38:16.140
<v Speaker 2>Sounds like a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They haven't done any research,</v>

879
00:38:16.141 --> 00:38:18.600
<v Speaker 2>no planning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't know anything about gear or</v>

880
00:38:18.601 --> 00:38:19.650
<v Speaker 2>anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

881
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:22.110
<v Speaker 2>they've read a walk in the woods.</v>

882
00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:23.970
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think this is a good idea.</v>

883
00:38:23.990 --> 00:38:26.760
<v Speaker 2>It is a walk in the woods by Bill</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bryson.</v>

884
00:38:26.761 --> 00:38:29.070
<v Speaker 2>It's probably the most popular book out</v>
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>

885
00:38:29.071 --> 00:38:29.904
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

886
00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:33.600
<v Speaker 2>it's just kind of a funny story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a good writer.</v>

887
00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:35.890
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he wrote that I in like the mid</v>

888
00:38:35.891 --> 00:38:37.300
<v Speaker 2>nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that book,</v>

889
00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:40.000
<v Speaker 2>if you look at like the Appalachian</v>
<v Speaker 2>trail hikers,</v>

890
00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.101
<v Speaker 2>it was just like put,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bup,</v>

891
00:38:41.101 --> 00:38:41.371
<v Speaker 2>bup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bup,</v>

892
00:38:41.371 --> 00:38:41.681
<v Speaker 2>bup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bup,</v>

893
00:38:41.681 --> 00:38:43.390
<v Speaker 2>bup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a walk in the woods is released.</v>

894
00:38:43.391 --> 00:38:44.810
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

895
00:38:44.811 --> 00:38:48.460
<v Speaker 2>It was like huge publicity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you heard of wild the book movie,</v>

896
00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:49.323
<v Speaker 2>Reese Witherspoon.</v>

897
00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:51.880
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

898
00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:53.070
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did hear about it.</v>

899
00:38:53.071 --> 00:38:54.270
<v Speaker 2>I never saw it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

900
00:38:54.330 --> 00:38:56.280
<v Speaker 2>that was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was that a movie about the Appalachian</v>

901
00:38:56.281 --> 00:38:57.540
<v Speaker 2>trail?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pacific crest trail.</v>

902
00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.100
<v Speaker 2>But it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the same thing.</v>

903
00:38:59.101 --> 00:39:03.240
<v Speaker 2>It was like the eighties is so historic</v>
<v Speaker 2>and iconic for long distance hiking</v>

904
00:39:03.241 --> 00:39:07.650
<v Speaker 2>trails that a walk in the woods did for</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 80 what wilde did for the Pacific</v>

905
00:39:07.651 --> 00:39:11.040
<v Speaker 2>crest trail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But wild is only released a few years</v>

906
00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:11.640
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

907
00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:12.840
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>same thing,</v>

908
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:16.080
<v Speaker 2>it's like Pacific crest trail was</v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively unknown to hikers and that</v>

909
00:39:16.081 --> 00:39:20.430
<v Speaker 2>book was released and an movie and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was just like now Pacific crest trail is</v>

910
00:39:20.431 --> 00:39:24.600
<v Speaker 2>really hot right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Pacific crest trail though is the</v>

911
00:39:24.601 --> 00:39:28.680
<v Speaker 2>one that goes from Mexico to California</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it goes all the way to Canada.</v>

912
00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:29.280
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

913
00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:29.550
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

914
00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:32.090
<v Speaker 2>Top.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not that much water there.</v>

915
00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:33.211
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

916
00:39:33.211 --> 00:39:34.590
<v Speaker 2>You talked about the east coast being</v>
<v Speaker 2>wet.</v>

917
00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:37.170
<v Speaker 2>I think so what do they do there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

918
00:39:37.171 --> 00:39:39.080
<v Speaker 2>my understanding is they have big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

919
00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:42.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't know the terminology is a big</v>
<v Speaker 2>water reservoir,</v>

920
00:39:42.811 --> 00:39:46.740
<v Speaker 2>like a big concrete cylinder out in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>middle of the,</v>

921
00:39:46.741 --> 00:39:50.660
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the desert and I don't know if it's</v>

922
00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:53.550
<v Speaker 2>rain water or if somebody actually goes</v>
<v Speaker 2>out there and fills it up,</v>

923
00:39:53.590 --> 00:39:55.800
<v Speaker 2>kind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kinda like a trail trail.</v>

924
00:39:55.801 --> 00:39:58.110
<v Speaker 2>Angel kind of goes out there and trail</v>
<v Speaker 2>angel.</v>

925
00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:03.140
<v Speaker 2>That's another term to trail angel</v>
<v Speaker 2>take.</v>

926
00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:07.200
<v Speaker 2>We'll take it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll take a sidestep into.</v>

927
00:40:07.201 --> 00:40:10.290
<v Speaker 2>It's just a trend is going to educate us</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the trail.</v>

928
00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.130
<v Speaker 2>Angel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go ahead.</v>

929
00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:11.963
<v Speaker 2>Smooth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

930
00:40:11.970 --> 00:40:12.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll get,</v>

931
00:40:12.570 --> 00:40:14.880
<v Speaker 2>we'll get an 18 dictionary going.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

932
00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:17.870
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the trail angels in that term was um,</v>

933
00:40:18.330 --> 00:40:21.150
<v Speaker 2>when you're hiking and eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you come to towns and you're like,</v>

934
00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:24.000
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I need transportation to the grocery</v>

935
00:40:24.001 --> 00:40:27.030
<v Speaker 2>store.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The grocery store is actually 10 miles</v>

936
00:40:27.031 --> 00:40:28.770
<v Speaker 2>away from the trail crossing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

937
00:40:28.771 --> 00:40:30.870
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does that mean a hike 10 more miles down</v>

938
00:40:30.871 --> 00:40:34.110
<v Speaker 2>the highway to get some groceries?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then 10 more miles back.</v>

939
00:40:34.111 --> 00:40:35.100
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hitchhike.</v>

940
00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:37.590
<v Speaker 2>And then you hitchhike in town.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's kind of that,</v>

941
00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:40.920
<v Speaker 2>that person then becomes a trail angel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

942
00:40:40.921 --> 00:40:43.980
<v Speaker 2>But hitchhiking is fucking dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever done it?</v>

943
00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:46.950
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe in the younger days.</v>

944
00:40:47.730 --> 00:40:48.840
<v Speaker 2>Trying to think.</v>

945
00:40:50.330 --> 00:40:53.760
<v Speaker 2>I definitely got rides from people when</v>
<v Speaker 2>my car broke down in,</v>

946
00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:57.110
<v Speaker 2>in Massachusetts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't think I actually hitchhiked</v>

947
00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:00.630
<v Speaker 2>like that was desperation without</v>
<v Speaker 2>intent.</v>

948
00:41:00.631 --> 00:41:02.300
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm going to get a ride from</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody.</v>

949
00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.230
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I never.</v>

950
00:41:03.231 --> 00:41:06.200
<v Speaker 2>I never went out there and put my thumb</v>
<v Speaker 2>out and said I'm going to get from here</v>

951
00:41:06.201 --> 00:41:08.180
<v Speaker 2>to there by hitchhiking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never do that.</v>

952
00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:12.040
<v Speaker 2>You did?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

953
00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:12.910
<v Speaker 2>you did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

954
00:41:12.910 --> 00:41:14.590
<v Speaker 2>you're a fairly young guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How old are you?</v>

955
00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:16.450
<v Speaker 2>Twenty eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twenty eight.</v>

956
00:41:16.451 --> 00:41:17.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

957
00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:20.920
<v Speaker 2>So you're talking about within the last</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 years you hitchhiked a fair amount.</v>

958
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:23.680
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's like when people already know</v>

959
00:41:23.681 --> 00:41:25.450
<v Speaker 2>that hitchhiking is a good way to kill</v>
<v Speaker 2>folks.</v>

960
00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:29.500
<v Speaker 2>Like if you want to kill somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you kill some fucking kid with a</v>

961
00:41:29.501 --> 00:41:30.820
<v Speaker 2>backpack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the move,</v>

962
00:41:30.850 --> 00:41:32.600
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a great opportunity to kill or</v>

963
00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:34.070
<v Speaker 2>above.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to be one of those</v>

964
00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:36.370
<v Speaker 1>Psychos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

965
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:41.470
<v Speaker 1>I would just assume yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody was pretty nice.</v>

966
00:41:41.871 --> 00:41:43.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's different parts of the country too,</v>

967
00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:45.560
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you're going to go hitchhiking</v>

968
00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:49.430
<v Speaker 1>in like New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna run into some really weird</v>

969
00:41:49.431 --> 00:41:51.140
<v Speaker 1>people if you're like just outside of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan,</v>

970
00:41:51.141 --> 00:41:52.370
<v Speaker 1>you got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you thaw them out and you try and get</v>

971
00:41:52.371 --> 00:41:54.890
<v Speaker 1>picked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might get picked up by a fucking</v>

972
00:41:54.891 --> 00:41:58.340
<v Speaker 1>complete psycho.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you're in Wyoming or something</v>

973
00:41:58.341 --> 00:42:00.980
<v Speaker 1>and there's like no one out there and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're hiking and</v>

974
00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:06.080
<v Speaker 2>like rural Alabama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pennsylvania,</v>

975
00:42:06.081 --> 00:42:07.610
<v Speaker 2>those crack heads screaming at each</v>
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>

976
00:42:07.890 --> 00:42:10.110
<v Speaker 2>every other weirdos everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But will say like,</v>

977
00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:11.930
<v Speaker 2>ah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So before the [inaudible] in New Zealand</v>

978
00:42:11.931 --> 00:42:15.830
<v Speaker 2>and New Zealand is higher standard of</v>
<v Speaker 2>living in the states and I feel like</v>

979
00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:18.530
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's very low crime right there.</v>

980
00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:24.250
<v Speaker 2>And hitchhiking is not taboo there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I always heard that New Zealand was kind</v>

981
00:42:24.741 --> 00:42:26.470
<v Speaker 2>of like the states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

982
00:42:26.850 --> 00:42:30.090
<v Speaker 2>was in the fifties and it was just like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kinda like a,</v>

983
00:42:30.091 --> 00:42:31.580
<v Speaker 2>a safe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>happy place,</v>

984
00:42:31.581 --> 00:42:32.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no crime.</v>

985
00:42:32.810 --> 00:42:35.000
<v Speaker 2>Everybody's nice to each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>High standard of living.</v>

986
00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:38.530
<v Speaker 2>And in New Zealand it was like they had</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

987
00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:41.840
<v Speaker 2>some bus stops,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the equivalent of like a bus stop.</v>

988
00:42:41.841 --> 00:42:46.310
<v Speaker 2>And it was like a hitchhiking bench,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you would sit there and like people</v>

989
00:42:46.311 --> 00:42:49.310
<v Speaker 2>would drive on their way to work and</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody will be sitting on the bench</v>

990
00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:50.420
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

991
00:42:50.450 --> 00:42:51.210
<v Speaker 2>pick me up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

992
00:42:51.210 --> 00:42:52.790
<v Speaker 2>But it's like systemized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

993
00:42:52.791 --> 00:42:55.850
<v Speaker 2>it's like people have hitchhike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was like that.</v>

994
00:42:55.880 --> 00:42:57.770
<v Speaker 2>The taboo was kind of broken in New</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zealand.</v>

995
00:42:57.771 --> 00:42:59.090
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is normal,</v>

996
00:42:59.091 --> 00:43:02.180
<v Speaker 2>people are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an economical,</v>

997
00:43:02.181 --> 00:43:03.590
<v Speaker 2>it's efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like why not,</v>

998
00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:04.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

999
00:43:05.150 --> 00:43:07.340
<v Speaker 1>it's not something I would ever do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But man,</v>

1000
00:43:07.341 --> 00:43:11.810
<v Speaker 1>I remember I got my car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my car broke down once in a snow storm</v>

1001
00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:14.810
<v Speaker 1>and these people took me back to their</v>
<v Speaker 1>house and they were so normal.</v>

1002
00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:17.740
<v Speaker 1>They were really normal people and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>made me that.</v>

1003
00:43:17.741 --> 00:43:22.741
<v Speaker 1>I was on my way to visit my girlfriend</v>
<v Speaker 1>and her mom and her drove to get me at</v>

1004
00:43:23.181 --> 00:43:27.230
<v Speaker 1>these people's house and I was in there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was driving up there and we just got</v>

1005
00:43:27.231 --> 00:43:29.390
<v Speaker 1>caught in a freak snowstorm car broke</v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

1006
00:43:29.810 --> 00:43:32.330
<v Speaker 1>And I remember thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what kind of person?</v>

1007
00:43:32.331 --> 00:43:35.400
<v Speaker 1>Just pick someone up and takes them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>their how they're so nice.</v>

1008
00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:36.740
<v Speaker 1>Let's be a Weirdo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no,</v>

1009
00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:39.020
<v Speaker 1>they were really nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were really nice people.</v>

1010
00:43:39.080 --> 00:43:40.940
<v Speaker 1>They just took a chance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1011
00:43:41.090 --> 00:43:43.010
<v Speaker 2>I guess the fear comes from that like</v>
<v Speaker 2>point,</v>

1012
00:43:43.011 --> 00:43:43.880
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one percent,</v>

1013
00:43:43.881 --> 00:43:45.390
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's going to do something with like a</v>

1014
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:48.920
<v Speaker 2>vast majority or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why not?</v>

1015
00:43:48.921 --> 00:43:51.650
<v Speaker 2>I'm just looking to help somebody out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like something with like airbnb.</v>

1016
00:43:51.651 --> 00:43:52.970
<v Speaker 2>There was that fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>

1017
00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:54.740
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no way I could let somebody come</v>

1018
00:43:54.741 --> 00:43:58.040
<v Speaker 2>into my house or couchsurfing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Couchsurfing is,</v>

1019
00:43:58.060 --> 00:43:58.893
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1020
00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:02.270
<v Speaker 2>airbnb for free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Essentially.</v>

1021
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:05.810
<v Speaker 2>You put up your couch on this website</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you offer.</v>

1022
00:44:06.290 --> 00:44:07.960
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1023
00:44:07.961 --> 00:44:08.930
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I've got a couch,</v>

1024
00:44:08.931 --> 00:44:10.590
<v Speaker 2>does anybody want to stay on it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you say,</v>

1025
00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:14.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm coming through on these dates and</v>
<v Speaker 2>your request the couch for free.</v>

1026
00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:16.100
<v Speaker 2>But it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember that when that website was</v>

1027
00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:18.260
<v Speaker 2>really becoming popular about 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>ago,</v>

1028
00:44:18.261 --> 00:44:19.580
<v Speaker 2>people had that same idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

1029
00:44:20.090 --> 00:44:22.000
<v Speaker 2>no way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is only for nutjobs.</v>

1030
00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:26.150
<v Speaker 2>Like it's hugely popular now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And airbnb and all that stuff's like,</v>

1031
00:44:26.151 --> 00:44:28.180
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let somebody come and stay in your house</v>

1032
00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:33.300
<v Speaker 1>and meet travelers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Share authentic travel experiences as</v>

1033
00:44:33.301 --> 00:44:35.100
<v Speaker 1>opposed to what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fake travel experiences.</v>

1034
00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:37.170
<v Speaker 1>Fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that mean authentic?</v>

00:44:37.350 --> 00:44:38.910
<v Speaker 1>Meet New People,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explore the world,</v>

1036
00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:44.840

<v Speaker 1>find a couch.</v>

<v Speaker 1>decided to organize this.</v>

1043
00:44:57.960 --> 00:45:02.960
<v Speaker 1>They decided to make a website.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every year we support 400,000 hosts,</v>

1059
00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:50.070
<v Speaker 1>You can't afford a fucking hotel room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>

1060
00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:52.280

00:45:52.290 --> 00:45:55.230
<v Speaker 1>Looking at some really delicious food.</v>

1062
00:45:55.231 --> 00:45:57.960
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strange because it's a very</v>

1063
00:45:57.961 --> 00:46:01.350
<v Speaker 1>romanticized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is really organized.</v>

1064
00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:06.680
<v Speaker 1>This website's super well done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Local hosts and they have avatars of</v>

1065
00:46:07.381 --> 00:46:09.120
<v Speaker 1>images,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reviews.</v>

1066
00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:10.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

1067
00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:15.570

<v Speaker 1>about me.</v>

1069
00:46:20.460 --> 00:46:24.180
<v Speaker 1>Current mission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I host one person only?</v>

1070
00:46:24.210 --> 00:46:25.920
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is weird.</v>

1071
00:46:26.430 --> 00:46:27.690
<v Speaker 1>You can put your ketchup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do.</v>

1072
00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:28.980
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not gonna happen.</v>

1073
00:46:29.910 --> 00:46:30.930
<v Speaker 1>But it is interesting.</v>

1074
00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:35.930
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the good aspects of it are,</v>

1075
00:46:36.350 --> 00:46:38.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure far outweigh the negatives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1076
00:46:38.850 --> 00:46:41.790
<v Speaker 1>most people are just enjoying</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

1077
00:46:41.791 --> 00:46:45.210
<v Speaker 1>Meeting nice people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meeting like minded people,</v>

1078
00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:48.390
<v Speaker 1>traveling around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like my feet are obviously humor aside,</v>

1079
00:46:48.391 --> 00:46:52.530
<v Speaker 1>but my fears are probably fairly</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfounded.</v>

1080
00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:55.710
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But isn't that kind of how it is with</v>

1081
00:46:55.711 --> 00:46:58.320
<v Speaker 1>life like most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most people that you meet,</v>

1082
00:46:58.350 --> 00:47:02.490
<v Speaker 1>like the vast majority of people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>really pretty nice.</v>

1083
00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:06.900
<v Speaker 1>Like this is all intention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a really safe time to be a person,</v>

1084
00:47:07.410 --> 00:47:08.243
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1085
00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:12.690
<v Speaker 1>almost all interactions you have with</v>
<v Speaker 1>people on a daily basis are safe and</v>

1086
00:47:12.691 --> 00:47:15.660
<v Speaker 1>fairly friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even like rude people are like,</v>

1087
00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:16.441
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the big deal?</v>

1088
00:47:16.441 --> 00:47:17.920
<v Speaker 1>They say a word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1089
00:47:17.921 --> 00:47:19.710
<v Speaker 1>like most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1090
00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:22.890
<v Speaker 1>Most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost nothing happens most of the time,</v>

1091
00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:27.930
<v Speaker 1>but we're so obsessed with the news</v>
<v Speaker 1>where you tune into any news channel,</v>

1092
00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:32.960
<v Speaker 1>all you're getting is the collective bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>news of 7 billion people because that's</v>

1093
00:47:33.431 --> 00:47:34.264
<v Speaker 1>what sells.</v>

1094
00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:36.460
<v Speaker 1>If it bleeds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it leads run with it.</v>

1095
00:47:36.470 --> 00:47:38.350
<v Speaker 1>Mike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike runs with it.</v>

1096
00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:39.821
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1097
00:47:39.821 --> 00:47:42.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually a very.</v>

1098
00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.290
<v Speaker 1>When you really look at it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a very positive trend that people</v>

1099
00:47:47.291 --> 00:47:50.290
<v Speaker 1>are doing this hosting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hosting people,</v>

1100
00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:53.670
<v Speaker 1>shared shared economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's this?</v>

1101
00:47:53.710 --> 00:47:55.090
<v Speaker 1>That's really nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1102
00:47:55.120 --> 00:47:57.850
<v Speaker 1>it's nice that people will offer up</v>
<v Speaker 1>their couch for free.</v>

1103
00:47:58.510 --> 00:48:00.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's good stuff.</v>

1104
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:04.810
<v Speaker 1>It is good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you ever stop and think like what</v>

1105
00:48:04.811 --> 00:48:09.490
<v Speaker 1>if I hadn't gone on this journey of</v>
<v Speaker 1>exploration and I stayed in the</v>

1106
00:48:09.491 --> 00:48:14.491
<v Speaker 1>accountant and you would be living that</v>
<v Speaker 1>life of the droning existence where</v>

1107
00:48:16.031 --> 00:48:19.900
<v Speaker 1>every day he just fucking Sean over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same place,</v>

1108
00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:24.760
<v Speaker 1>crunching numbers and hating life and</v>
<v Speaker 1>wishing for some kind of adventure,</v>

1109
00:48:24.761 --> 00:48:28.340
<v Speaker 1>something different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1110
00:48:28.650 --> 00:48:29.910
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't relate to.</v>

1111
00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:33.150
<v Speaker 2>I think no matter what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's 80 or something,</v>

1112
00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:34.440
<v Speaker 2>I think I would have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1113
00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:36.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm too impatient,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1114
00:48:36.151 --> 00:48:38.180
<v Speaker 2>I get bored too easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something,</v>

1115
00:48:38.181 --> 00:48:39.014
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have done something</v>

1116
00:48:39.060 --> 00:48:42.410
<v Speaker 1>then a lot of people don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people are like you and they</v>

1117
00:48:42.411 --> 00:48:44.150
<v Speaker 1>just never make that move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never,</v>

1118
00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:45.680
<v Speaker 1>they never take that chance.</v>

1119
00:48:45.830 --> 00:48:47.360
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think when I talked to even a lot of</v>

1120
00:48:47.361 --> 00:48:50.660
<v Speaker 2>my friends that are still doing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to call them crappy jobs,</v>

1121
00:48:50.661 --> 00:48:52.760
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I think they do provide a lot of</v>

1122
00:48:52.761 --> 00:48:53.900
<v Speaker 2>things that they like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1123
00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:54.830
<v Speaker 2>security.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't.</v>

1124
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:57.470
<v Speaker 2>Some people love that security,</v>
<v Speaker 2>getting a paycheck,</v>

1125
00:48:57.471 --> 00:48:59.000
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1126
00:49:00.200 --> 00:49:02.000
<v Speaker 2>but it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they view it like that.</v>

1127
00:49:02.001 --> 00:49:02.541
<v Speaker 2>It's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

1128
00:49:02.541 --> 00:49:04.310
<v Speaker 2>this may not be the best thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I like it,</v>

1129
00:49:04.311 --> 00:49:05.450
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like A.</v>

1130
00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:09.650
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like some people think this is so</v>

1131
00:49:09.651 --> 00:49:11.300
<v Speaker 2>bad or I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just can't.</v>

1132
00:49:11.301 --> 00:49:12.770
<v Speaker 2>I just have to like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't think that,</v>

1133
00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:15.170
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that threshold ever crosses most people,</v>

1134
00:49:15.171 --> 00:49:15.960
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1135
00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:17.250
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1136
00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:18.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people very,</v>

1137
00:49:18.990 --> 00:49:22.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the personality types that go on that</v>

1138
00:49:22.321 --> 00:49:24.150
<v Speaker 1>trail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's like a very,</v>

1139
00:49:24.151 --> 00:49:28.950
<v Speaker 1>very extreme personality type,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think most people have a certain</v>

1140
00:49:28.951 --> 00:49:31.060
<v Speaker 1>amount of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if not wanderlust,</v>

1141
00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:34.650
<v Speaker 1>at least curiosity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a matter of how much of it do</v>

1142
00:49:34.651 --> 00:49:36.780
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of it do you nurture?</v>

1143
00:49:37.470 --> 00:49:40.800
<v Speaker 1>How much of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much of that that needed to feed</v>

1144
00:49:41.630 --> 00:49:42.150
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

1145
00:49:42.150 --> 00:49:45.420
<v Speaker 1>there's also a real problem than not</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizing the finite nature of</v>

1146
00:49:45.421 --> 00:49:47.040
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1147
00:49:47.070 --> 00:49:50.940
<v Speaker 1>I mean just when you're 20 especially or</v>
<v Speaker 1>21 or whatever it is,</v>

1148
00:49:50.941 --> 00:49:54.210
<v Speaker 1>when you enter into these jobs you don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>realize like,</v>

1149
00:49:54.211 --> 00:49:57.630
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've only got like a few decades.</v>

1150
00:49:58.010 --> 00:49:59.550
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a good time.</v>

1151
00:49:59.551 --> 00:50:02.910
<v Speaker 1>You could do this for 40 years easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

1152
00:50:02.911 --> 00:50:04.020
<v Speaker 1>easily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>easily.</v>

1153
00:50:04.021 --> 00:50:08.400
<v Speaker 1>And then we've all met those people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have done it for 40 years and they just</v>

1154
00:50:08.401 --> 00:50:11.070
<v Speaker 1>beaten down by life and they have that</v>
<v Speaker 1>dull,</v>

1155
00:50:11.610 --> 00:50:15.030
<v Speaker 1>desperate look in their eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just the sadness in their eyes</v>

1156
00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:17.550
<v Speaker 1>where their life is just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>

1157
00:50:17.880 --> 00:50:19.890
<v Speaker 1>it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't turned out well.</v>

1158
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:21.760
<v Speaker 1>There's not a lot of joy there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1159
00:50:21.780 --> 00:50:23.760
<v Speaker 1>And hold onto the vacations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big Time.</v>

1160
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:26.640
<v Speaker 1>You're scaring the shit out of me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chris.</v>

1161
00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:27.980
<v Speaker 1>Scaring the shit out</v>

1162
00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:31.040
<v Speaker 2>of me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you in the middle of doing all this,</v>

1163
00:50:31.070 --> 00:50:32.270
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you do this,</v>

1164
00:50:32.271 --> 00:50:36.410
<v Speaker 2>you go on this crazy seven month</v>
<v Speaker 2>adventure and when it's over,</v>

1165
00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:41.070
<v Speaker 2>what was that like when you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you hit the end and you realize</v>

1166
00:50:41.071 --> 00:50:42.600
<v Speaker 2>they're like a bell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you ring or anything like that.</v>

1167
00:50:43.410 --> 00:50:45.300
<v Speaker 2>She put a bell up there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So going north,</v>

1168
00:50:45.301 --> 00:50:46.500
<v Speaker 2>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's like,</v>

1169
00:50:46.890 --> 00:50:51.000
<v Speaker 2>there's like this epic Mountain Qatada</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like a beautiful big mountain.</v>

1170
00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:55.080
<v Speaker 2>I'm one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the most epic climbs that's in</v>

1171
00:50:55.081 --> 00:50:56.850
<v Speaker 2>Maine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you go south,</v>

1172
00:50:57.090 --> 00:50:59.580
<v Speaker 2>you end in Georgia and you end on</v>
<v Speaker 2>Springer Mountain,</v>

1173
00:50:59.581 --> 00:51:01.950
<v Speaker 2>which is just not as,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not as that,</v>

1174
00:51:01.951 --> 00:51:03.120
<v Speaker 2>but God is dramatic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1175
00:51:03.121 --> 00:51:03.691
<v Speaker 2>you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1176
00:51:03.691 --> 00:51:04.980
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean you finish it,</v>

1177
00:51:04.981 --> 00:51:06.930
<v Speaker 2>there's just a plaque and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1178
00:51:06.931 --> 00:51:09.270
<v Speaker 2>you finished really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you touch the plaque,</v>

1179
00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:11.490
<v Speaker 2>you have to touch it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does he get right before and you</v>

1180
00:51:11.491 --> 00:51:14.280

<v Speaker 2>the fuck this.</v>

1181
00:51:14.340 --> 00:51:16.560
<v Speaker 2>Just gloves for the plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1182
00:51:17.410 --> 00:51:18.510
<v Speaker 2>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's good.</v>

1183
00:51:18.570 --> 00:51:19.260
<v Speaker 2>That's the main.</v>

1184
00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:21.540
<v Speaker 2>That's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the finish and finish.</v>

1185
00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:22.530
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1189
00:51:29.640 --> 00:51:31.190

<v Speaker 2>It's usually,</v>

1190
00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:34.770
<v Speaker 2>at least I would probably do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd go hike it in a day and then get</v>

1191
00:51:34.771 --> 00:51:39.771
<v Speaker 2>that weird feeling of watching these</v>
<v Speaker 2>people that are covered in two inches of</v>

1192
00:51:40.261 --> 00:51:42.330
<v Speaker 2>grime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Climb up that hill.</v>

<v Speaker 2>seven months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hecker Springer Mountain.</v>

00:51:55.610 --> 00:51:56.740
<v Speaker 2>He's just all hair.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

1198
00:51:59.310 --> 00:52:00.120
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

<v Speaker 2>that's where it starts.</v>

1201
00:52:03.691 --> 00:52:05.100
<v Speaker 2>Is that the gateway?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

1202
00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:07.470
<v Speaker 2>that's what's called the approach trail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not the,</v>

1205
00:52:12.691 --> 00:52:15.530
<v Speaker 2>but that's not a great shot of it.</v>

<v Speaker 2>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was seriously one of the most</v>

1233
00:53:29.041 --> 00:53:31.230
<v Speaker 2>emotional times in my life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't imagine.</v>

1234
00:53:31.290 --> 00:53:32.220
<v Speaker 2>I was just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1235
00:53:32.221 --> 00:53:34.380
<v Speaker 2>Even even like that morning I woke up</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was just like,</v>

1236

<v Speaker 2>oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is,</v>

1237

<v Speaker 2>this is ending,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1238
00:53:37.210 --> 00:53:39.540
<v Speaker 2>it was like so much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just so long.</v>

1239
00:53:39.541 --> 00:53:41.720
<v Speaker 2>I had been thinking about it from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1240
00:53:41.740 --> 00:53:43.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean childhood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1241
00:53:43.141 --> 00:53:46.170
<v Speaker 2>and then it was like not only thinking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about it for a decade,</v>

1242
00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:50.400
<v Speaker 2>but then it was actually hiking the darn</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing for six months and it was just</v>

1243
00:53:50.401 --> 00:53:51.820
<v Speaker 2>like getting there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that time,</v>

1244
00:53:51.821 --> 00:53:54.960
<v Speaker 2>like I had stress fractures forming and</v>
<v Speaker 2>my feet and uh,</v>

1245
00:53:55.410 --> 00:53:56.760
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just in bad shape.</v>

1246
00:53:56.761 --> 00:53:58.220
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't sleeping well because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1247
00:53:58.740 --> 00:54:02.310
<v Speaker 2>at night it was going to get into zero</v>
<v Speaker 2>degrees every night and my sleeping bag</v>

1248
00:54:02.311 --> 00:54:03.630
<v Speaker 2>was not cutting it.</v>

1249
00:54:03.630 --> 00:54:06.450
<v Speaker 2>So it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was just a lot man,</v>

1250
00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:08.610
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stress fractures in your feet,</v>

1251
00:54:08.611 --> 00:54:09.890
<v Speaker 2>huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1252
00:54:09.910 --> 00:54:10.670
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1253
00:54:10.670 --> 00:54:12.780
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've had had stress fractures from cross</v>

1254
00:54:12.781 --> 00:54:15.190
<v Speaker 2>country in high school,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I knew what they felt like,</v>

1255
00:54:15.330 --> 00:54:16.141
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is coming.</v>

1256
00:54:16.141 --> 00:54:17.370
<v Speaker 2>It's just a matter of time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>

1257
00:54:17.730 --> 00:54:20.040
<v Speaker 2>Now what kind of hiking shoes did you</v>
<v Speaker 2>wear?</v>

1258
00:54:20.060 --> 00:54:20.370
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

1259
00:54:20.370 --> 00:54:23.130
<v Speaker 2>it seems like your gear would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>critical big time.</v>

1260
00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:24.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1261
00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:26.630
<v Speaker 2>I started off with a brand called</v>
<v Speaker 2>Selayla.</v>

1262
00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:30.150
<v Speaker 2>They were kind of like a technical</v>
<v Speaker 2>climbing shoe actually,</v>

1263
00:54:30.151 --> 00:54:32.190
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that they are a little more</v>

1264
00:54:33.180 --> 00:54:34.260
<v Speaker 2>stiff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stiff,</v>

1265
00:54:34.261 --> 00:54:35.140
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1266
00:54:35.250 --> 00:54:37.830
<v Speaker 2>makes them good for some tough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tough trail.</v>

1267
00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:41.270
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I switched to a trail runners and I</v>

1268
00:54:41.271 --> 00:54:42.630
<v Speaker 2>don't do run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1269
00:54:42.631 --> 00:54:44.460
<v Speaker 2>I started reading really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really recently,</v>

1270
00:54:44.461 --> 00:54:46.140
<v Speaker 2>like a few days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I saw you post something on</v>

1271
00:54:46.141 --> 00:54:46.980
<v Speaker 2>facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You had a rough,</v>

1272
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:48.840
<v Speaker 2>a rough run,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking terrible at it.</v>

1273
00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:53.070
<v Speaker 2>A bit like a bowling ball.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not good for running some weight,</v>

1274
00:54:53.150 --> 00:54:54.330
<v Speaker 2>want to keep doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

1275
00:54:54.331 --> 00:54:56.430
<v Speaker 2>I've been running for a few days now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But uh,</v>

1276
00:54:56.431 --> 00:54:58.270
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I switched to um,</v>

1277
00:54:58.350 --> 00:55:00.960
<v Speaker 2>basically just running shoes with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>little thicker tread,</v>

1278
00:55:01.190 --> 00:55:04.060
<v Speaker 2>like Solomon's Solomon's is a great</v>
<v Speaker 2>brand.</v>

1279
00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:07.800
<v Speaker 2>I got those for the very purpose of</v>
<v Speaker 2>running up hills.</v>

1280
00:55:07.930 --> 00:55:08.970
<v Speaker 2>You like them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1281
00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:11.220
<v Speaker 2>it seemed good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've got good traction to them.</v>

1282
00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:15.270
<v Speaker 2>Could tread like a thick tread,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet there are still built like a</v>

1283
00:55:15.271 --> 00:55:17.670
<v Speaker 2>running shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a good hiking shoes.</v>

1284
00:55:17.671 --> 00:55:21.030
<v Speaker 2>Something that you can breathe and give</v>
<v Speaker 2>you some cushion and you don't need any</v>

1285
00:55:21.031 --> 00:55:21.930
<v Speaker 2>ankle support,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1286
00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:23.430
<v Speaker 2>feel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like that's overrated</v>

1287
00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:25.590
<v Speaker 2>mountaineering thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1288
00:55:25.591 --> 00:55:28.110
<v Speaker 2>I think there's kind of this theory that</v>
<v Speaker 2>your ankles toughened up.</v>

1289
00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:31.170
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if that's really true,</v>

1290
00:55:31.171 --> 00:55:35.040
<v Speaker 2>but I think I kind of fell into that</v>
<v Speaker 2>belief that I was rolling ankles so much</v>

1291
00:55:35.041 --> 00:55:37.560
<v Speaker 2>in the first 100,</v>
<v Speaker 2>200 miles of the trail and by the end of</v>

1292
00:55:37.561 --> 00:55:41.070
<v Speaker 2>it was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just keep going,</v>

1293
00:55:41.071 --> 00:55:41.820
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1294
00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:43.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1295
00:55:43.111 --> 00:55:44.640
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always wondered about that because</v>

1296
00:55:44.641 --> 00:55:48.750
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people that hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were these like really stiff,</v>

1297
00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:53.140
<v Speaker 2>very tactical mountain hiking boots</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they,</v>

1298
00:55:53.141 --> 00:55:54.290
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go out that,</v>

1299
00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:57.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go like 10 inches up the ankle and</v>

1300
00:55:57.151 --> 00:55:59.250
<v Speaker 2>they lace them up tight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1301
00:55:59.251 --> 00:56:02.400
<v Speaker 2>I say when I used to go hunting with my</v>
<v Speaker 2>dad when I was a kid and we would,</v>

1302
00:56:02.401 --> 00:56:04.440
<v Speaker 2>we would wear those boots and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking back I'm like,</v>

1303
00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:05.291
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't get it.</v>

1304
00:56:05.291 --> 00:56:09.330
<v Speaker 2>And is it just because maybe the brush</v>
<v Speaker 2>is just so thick you need something like</v>

1305
00:56:09.420 --> 00:56:11.820
<v Speaker 2>durable to cross through that brush.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1306
00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:13.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you mean?</v>

1307
00:56:14.210 --> 00:56:16.320
<v Speaker 2>What do you wear when you go hunting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1308
00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:19.050
<v Speaker 2>it varies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never worn.</v>

1309
00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:22.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm running shoes like those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like trail running shoes,</v>

1310
00:56:22.321 --> 00:56:25.850
<v Speaker 2>but I know some people do do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do wear those and they like them and</v>

1311
00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:26.950
<v Speaker 2>some really good hunters.</v>

1312
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:29.620
<v Speaker 2>They were them exclusively.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There were like lightweight trail</v>

1313
00:56:29.621 --> 00:56:33.430
<v Speaker 2>runners and they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even Solomon actually makes a gator</v>

1314
00:56:34.240 --> 00:56:38.260
<v Speaker 2>for those trail runners so that you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for people to know what a gator is.</v>

1315
00:56:38.290 --> 00:56:43.180
<v Speaker 2>Gators like a thing that you slip over</v>
<v Speaker 2>your shoes and it cinches down tight so</v>

1316
00:56:43.181 --> 00:56:46.390
<v Speaker 2>that rocks and dirt and stuff doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>get deep into your shoe.</v>

1317
00:56:47.070 --> 00:56:49.720
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I think who you is coming out with a</v>

1318
00:56:49.721 --> 00:56:52.240
<v Speaker 2>boot that actually has a gator built in</v>
<v Speaker 2>was kind of interesting,</v>

1319
00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:54.880
<v Speaker 2>but they could see the salomon trail</v>
<v Speaker 2>gaters yeah.</v>

1320
00:56:54.881 --> 00:56:58.180
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the idea is to make sure that you're</v>

1321
00:56:58.181 --> 00:57:02.440
<v Speaker 2>not getting irritants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dirt and shit and debris.</v>

1322
00:57:02.830 --> 00:57:04.930
<v Speaker 2>Did you ever wear anything like that</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you were?</v>

1323
00:57:05.230 --> 00:57:06.063
<v Speaker 2>Definitely,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1324
00:57:06.070 --> 00:57:06.850
<v Speaker 2>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1325
00:57:06.850 --> 00:57:09.790
<v Speaker 2>Is that a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that a must have some hikers?</v>

1326
00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:12.960
<v Speaker 2>I'd say kind of roll their eyes at it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I started off rolling my eyes at it and</v>

1327
00:57:12.961 --> 00:57:14.560
<v Speaker 2>then it was just like you're saying it</v>
<v Speaker 2>was just good.</v>

1328
00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:18.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean five times a day I would get a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little pine needle in my sock and it's</v>

1329
00:57:18.581 --> 00:57:19.690
<v Speaker 2>just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh damn it.</v>

1330
00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:20.321
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1331
00:57:20.321 --> 00:57:22.490
<v Speaker 2>I got to get something to keep that</v>
<v Speaker 2>going out.</v>

1332
00:57:22.510 --> 00:57:26.920
<v Speaker 2>So I would imagine that you would have</v>
<v Speaker 2>an incredible ability to test gear.</v>

1333
00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:32.400
<v Speaker 2>Like nobody would probably know what</v>
<v Speaker 2>gears effective and durable and really,</v>

1334
00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:36.120
<v Speaker 2>really like over the longterm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1335
00:57:36.370 --> 00:57:37.270
<v Speaker 2>totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

1336
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:38.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a part of the Ata,</v>

1337
00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:41.700
<v Speaker 2>I'd been backpacking for over 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I thought I was kind of okay,</v>

1338
00:57:41.701 --> 00:57:43.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty familiar with this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

1339
00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:44.950
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1340
00:57:45.010 --> 00:57:46.330
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know anything about</v>
<v Speaker 2>backpacking.</v>

1341
00:57:46.331 --> 00:57:48.400
<v Speaker 2>And Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you test everything,</v>

1342
00:57:48.430 --> 00:57:50.380
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like even even after all your</v>

1343
00:57:50.381 --> 00:57:51.720
<v Speaker 2>research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you start realizing like,</v>

1344
00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:53.590
<v Speaker 2>hmm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a little bit better stuff out</v>

1345
00:57:53.591 --> 00:57:55.960
<v Speaker 2>there or yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can actually tweak this and improve</v>

1346
00:57:55.961 --> 00:57:56.560
<v Speaker 2>this and that.</v>

1347
00:57:56.560 --> 00:57:57.311
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But at the end of it,</v>

1348
00:57:57.311 --> 00:58:01.480
<v Speaker 2>it's like anybody was through hike.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This can get into some real nerdy</v>

1349
00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:03.020
<v Speaker 2>backpacking gear talk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1350
00:58:03.410 --> 00:58:07.930
<v Speaker 2>hunters get into real nerdy backpacking</v>
<v Speaker 2>gear talk when they talk about like deep</v>

1351
00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:10.690
<v Speaker 2>in the woods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back country hunting because weights</v>

1352
00:58:10.820 --> 00:58:11.920
<v Speaker 2>initiative,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge issue.</v>

1353
00:58:11.921 --> 00:58:14.260
<v Speaker 2>They chop the ends off of their</v>
<v Speaker 2>toothbrushes,</v>

1354
00:58:14.261 --> 00:58:16.320
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's like a big issue with you.</v>

1355
00:58:16.321 --> 00:58:17.910
<v Speaker 2>You did that to big time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1356
00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:18.850
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's so crazy.</v>

1357
00:58:18.851 --> 00:58:22.090
<v Speaker 2>Like the idea that the bottom of your</v>
<v Speaker 2>toothbrush every ounce,</v>

1358
00:58:22.091 --> 00:58:22.924
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

1359
00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:24.700
<v Speaker 2>You won't ounces equals pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1360
00:58:25.090 --> 00:58:26.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that was one thing that got cody and</v>

1361
00:58:26.921 --> 00:58:29.350
<v Speaker 2>I talked to him was cody was talking</v>
<v Speaker 2>about cutting,</v>

1362
00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:32.860
<v Speaker 2>cutting weight from backpacking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like my impression,</v>

1363
00:58:32.861 --> 00:58:36.150
<v Speaker 2>at least when we were talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was thinking hunters.</v>

1364
00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:40.030
<v Speaker 2>We're almost kind of the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Chubby guy in the blind.</v>

1365
00:58:40.090 --> 00:58:41.170
<v Speaker 2>It was kind of my idea.</v>

1366
00:58:41.170 --> 00:58:42.580
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when my dad and I would hunt,</v>

1367
00:58:42.581 --> 00:58:45.750
<v Speaker 2>it was Kinda just truly sitting there</v>
<v Speaker 2>with blue jeans and it was just kinda</v>

1368
00:58:45.770 --> 00:58:46.361
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>

1369
00:58:46.361 --> 00:58:47.610
<v Speaker 2>there's a duck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1370
00:58:47.850 --> 00:58:51.100
<v Speaker 2>it was like talking to cody,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think hunting I was doing was pretty</v>

1371
00:58:51.101 --> 00:58:54.370
<v Speaker 2>amateur and it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cody was talking about cutting weight</v>

1372
00:58:54.371 --> 00:58:57.610
<v Speaker 2>significantly in that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hunters have kind of latched onto some</v>

1373
00:58:57.611 --> 00:58:59.680
<v Speaker 2>of the backpacking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1374
00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:00.760
<v Speaker 2>ethos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you will,</v>

1375
00:59:00.761 --> 00:59:04.210
<v Speaker 2>about shaving every ounce.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's like y'all carry so much more</v>

1376
00:59:04.211 --> 00:59:06.460
<v Speaker 2>gear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like you got weapons,</v>

1377
00:59:06.461 --> 00:59:07.350
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's.</v>

1378
00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:11.740
<v Speaker 2>Those things aren't made to count every</v>
<v Speaker 2>ounce I would imagine we had.</v>

1379
00:59:11.741 --> 00:59:14.620
<v Speaker 2>Depends on what you caring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there are some lightweight rifles</v>

1380
00:59:14.621 --> 00:59:17.770
<v Speaker 2>that people use so that are like carbon</v>
<v Speaker 2>five barrels and stuff.</v>

1381
00:59:18.130 --> 00:59:21.890
<v Speaker 2>But the issue with those is they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unless you're like prone and you're</v>

1382
00:59:21.891 --> 00:59:22.160
<v Speaker 2>laying</v>

1383
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:25.190
<v Speaker 1>down on something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they move a little bit more and a lot of</v>

1384
00:59:25.191 --> 00:59:28.040
<v Speaker 1>people think they're not as accurate as</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a real heavy rifle.</v>

1385
00:59:28.070 --> 00:59:30.140
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sacrifices.</v>

1386
00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:32.180
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They look a heavy rifle,</v>

1387
00:59:32.450 --> 00:59:34.070
<v Speaker 1>like a heavy barrel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thick,</v>

1388
00:59:34.071 --> 00:59:36.410
<v Speaker 1>heavy barrel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the same thing was bose.</v>

1389
00:59:36.570 --> 00:59:40.790
<v Speaker 1>That's a weird thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like some people like heavy bose because</v>

1390
00:59:40.791 --> 00:59:43.020
<v Speaker 1>it's usually you hold steadier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1391
00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:47.180
<v Speaker 1>there's the thought behind it that you</v>
<v Speaker 1>have something light in your hand and</v>

1392
00:59:47.181 --> 00:59:49.550
<v Speaker 1>you're shaking a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like maybe you're a little nerves,</v>

1393
00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:52.400
<v Speaker 1>he might move around a little bit more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you've got something that's</v>

1394
00:59:52.550 --> 00:59:53.740
<v Speaker 1>stable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he heavy,</v>

1395
00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:56.000
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll have more stability when you're</v>

1396
00:59:56.001 --> 00:59:59.750
<v Speaker 1>executing the shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But killer equipment to.</v>

1397
00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:02.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of guys carry spotting scopes and</v>

1398
01:00:02.330 --> 01:00:07.160
<v Speaker 1>15 power by nose and they have eight to</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 power by nose around their neck.</v>

1399
01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:10.370
<v Speaker 1>And</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1400
01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:13.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on what kind of stuff you use.</v>

1401
01:00:13.550 --> 01:00:14.660
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people,</v>

1402
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:16.550
<v Speaker 1>they'll sacrifice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1403
01:00:16.820 --> 01:00:19.120
<v Speaker 1>like spotting scopes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They won't do that,</v>

1404
01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:20.300
<v Speaker 1>they won't bring it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But some people were,</v>

1405
01:00:20.540 --> 01:00:22.550
<v Speaker 1>some people also want to film other</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

1406
01:00:22.670 --> 01:00:27.590
<v Speaker 1>so they bring tripods for filming and a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tripod for glassing glassing meaning you</v>

1407
01:00:27.591 --> 01:00:28.361
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lock,</v>

1408
01:00:28.361 --> 01:00:29.194
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1409
01:00:29.450 --> 01:00:32.480
<v Speaker 1>either by [inaudible] or a spotting</v>
<v Speaker 1>scope on a tripod,</v>

1410
01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:35.570
<v Speaker 1>so you get a real steady view because it</v>
<v Speaker 1>really makes a difference.</v>

1411
01:00:35.571 --> 01:00:38.000
<v Speaker 1>Like if you see more animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1412
01:00:38.001 --> 01:00:40.640
<v Speaker 1>if you're holding up like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] in your hand,</v>

1413
01:00:40.930 --> 01:00:44.270
<v Speaker 1>you got to Kinda like put your elbows on</v>
<v Speaker 1>your knees and you sit down.</v>

1414
01:00:44.271 --> 01:00:46.700
<v Speaker 1>But it's not as good like being on a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tripod,</v>

1415
01:00:46.701 --> 01:00:49.880
<v Speaker 1>so the best way for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then you got carry the equipment,</v>

1416
01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:51.650
<v Speaker 1>you've got to carry that fucking tripod</v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

1417
01:00:52.070 --> 01:00:54.350
<v Speaker 1>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a big difference between</v>

1418
01:00:54.351 --> 01:00:59.351
<v Speaker 1>people that they carry their stuff in</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they make a camp versus people</v>

1419
01:01:00.051 --> 01:01:02.210
<v Speaker 1>to keep their camp on their back all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1420
01:01:02.210 --> 01:01:04.700
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's different kinds of hunting.</v>

1421
01:01:04.730 --> 01:01:05.110
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

1422
01:01:05.110 --> 01:01:06.500
<v Speaker 1>do you know that ever took bag?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

1423
01:01:06.530 --> 01:01:09.230
<v Speaker 1>I think cody was mentioning it was like</v>
<v Speaker 1>60 or 70 pounds.</v>

1424
01:01:09.410 --> 01:01:10.640
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any idea?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1425
01:01:10.641 --> 01:01:13.100
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys will carry in 60,</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 pounds.</v>

1426
01:01:13.101 --> 01:01:15.590
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty standard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>

1427
01:01:15.591 --> 01:01:18.050
<v Speaker 1>they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These guys are not carrying their camp</v>

1428
01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:21.170
<v Speaker 1>on their back just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if they do like if they know they</v>

1429
01:01:21.171 --> 01:01:23.420
<v Speaker 1>have to go in deep and they have to live</v>
<v Speaker 1>off their back.</v>

1430
01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:25.650
<v Speaker 1>Like they have a Bibi Bibi tent and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

1431
01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:28.790
<v Speaker 1>they do the whole thing off their back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most guys would try to drop it in the</v>

1432
01:01:28.791 --> 01:01:31.500
<v Speaker 1>forties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you carry around 40 fucking</v>

1433
01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:32.353
<v Speaker 1>pounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1434
01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:35.180
<v Speaker 1>like there's a company called the</v>
<v Speaker 1>outdoorsman and Phoenix and they make</v>

1435
01:01:35.181 --> 01:01:38.780
<v Speaker 1>like a real high end pack and one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that they've made that they</v>

1436
01:01:38.781 --> 01:01:42.800
<v Speaker 1>actually just sent me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a pack frame that has like an</v>

1437
01:01:42.801 --> 01:01:44.900
<v Speaker 1>Olympic plate mount on it.</v>

1438
01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:50.080
<v Speaker 1>So you can put like a 45 pound plate and</v>
<v Speaker 1>another 45 pound platelet and 90 pound</v>

1439
01:01:50.121 --> 01:01:53.720
<v Speaker 1>plate and you train with his fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>pack frame on.</v>

1440
01:01:53.900 --> 01:01:56.630
<v Speaker 1>So you put the frame on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean like a little,</v>

1441
01:01:56.631 --> 01:02:01.400
<v Speaker 1>like a weight lifting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like lifting slides onto your back the</v>

1442
01:02:01.401 --> 01:02:04.550
<v Speaker 1>same way with slide onto the end of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>barbell and it,</v>

1443
01:02:04.610 --> 01:02:05.660
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>use a clamp,</v>

1444
01:02:05.661 --> 01:02:08.570
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a barbell clamp locks the plate in</v>

1445
01:02:08.571 --> 01:02:10.370
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you go up hills and these</v>

1446
01:02:10.371 --> 01:02:13.100
<v Speaker 1>fucking things on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these guys are just trending.</v>

1447
01:02:13.130 --> 01:02:15.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're training to get ready for these</v>

1448
01:02:15.411 --> 01:02:18.410
<v Speaker 1>back country hunts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had the same idea as you did.</v>

1449
01:02:18.411 --> 01:02:19.770
<v Speaker 1>I thought hunters like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1450
01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:21.630
<v Speaker 1>duck dynasty guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're all fat.</v>

1451
01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they just rednecks.</v>

1452
01:02:23.551 --> 01:02:25.230
<v Speaker 1>They're shooting at Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1453
01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:29.460
<v Speaker 1>not western hunting is a big difference</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the southern hunter.</v>

1454
01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there's a big difference between</v>

1455
01:02:31.201 --> 01:02:34.200
<v Speaker 1>blind hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like people that sit in these blinds</v>

1456
01:02:34.201 --> 01:02:37.200
<v Speaker 1>when blind is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is like for people listening is like,</v>

1457
01:02:37.910 --> 01:02:42.360
<v Speaker 1>it's basically like a little structure</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's covered with like Cammo and</v>

1458
01:02:42.361 --> 01:02:43.290
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're hiding,</v>

1459
01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.090
<v Speaker 1>you're hiding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>waiting for the animal,</v>

1460
01:02:45.091 --> 01:02:47.820
<v Speaker 1>and then you shoot them or tree stand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing.</v>

1461
01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:49.860
<v Speaker 1>You're sitting in the tree stand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're waiting and then you shoot them.</v>

1462
01:02:50.250 --> 01:02:52.770
<v Speaker 1>There's a big difference between that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these western hunters,</v>

1463
01:02:52.771 --> 01:02:55.510
<v Speaker 1>particularly like elk hunters because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going into the mountains where</v>

1464
01:02:55.511 --> 01:02:59.400
<v Speaker 1>these animals live or mule deer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to the high country and</v>

1465
01:02:59.401 --> 01:03:02.250
<v Speaker 1>you're climbing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going up thousands of feet of</v>

1466
01:03:02.251 --> 01:03:04.770
<v Speaker 1>elevation every day up and down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>up and down,</v>

1467
01:03:04.771 --> 01:03:08.100
<v Speaker 1>and you have to have massive endurance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a lot of these guys start trail</v>

1468
01:03:08.101 --> 01:03:11.130
<v Speaker 1>running.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of these guys start putting packs</v>

1469
01:03:11.131 --> 01:03:13.950
<v Speaker 1>on their back with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with heavyweights in the pack and</v>

1470
01:03:13.951 --> 01:03:15.330
<v Speaker 1>training,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting ready for this.</v>

1471
01:03:15.390 --> 01:03:19.710
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise you're fucking miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're not in a real shape,</v>

1472
01:03:19.770 --> 01:03:21.240
<v Speaker 1>you're miserable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1473
01:03:21.250 --> 01:03:23.340
<v Speaker 1>Got a good foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to get a real fit.</v>

1474
01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:24.620
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1475
01:03:24.670 --> 01:03:26.820
<v Speaker 1>that's not what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1476
01:03:26.821 --> 01:03:29.220
<v Speaker 1>my friend Cameron names,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he does a lot of ultra marathons.</v>

1477
01:03:29.221 --> 01:03:31.110
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just did the big foot 200,</v>

1478
01:03:31.410 --> 01:03:34.380
<v Speaker 1>which is 205 miles in Washington state.</v>

1479
01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:37.380
<v Speaker 1>How long has it to 78 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He ran for seven,</v>

1480
01:03:37.381 --> 01:03:38.550
<v Speaker 1>eight hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1481
01:03:38.760 --> 01:03:41.000
<v Speaker 1>Fuck everything about that will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1482
01:03:41.010 --> 01:03:42.630
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that just shows,</v>

1483
01:03:42.631 --> 01:03:44.460
<v Speaker 1>you mean he's as extreme as it gets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1484
01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:47.070
<v Speaker 1>he's like one of the top bowhunters in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

1485
01:03:47.071 --> 01:03:50.130
<v Speaker 1>but the point is these people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes,</v>

1486
01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:51.073
<v Speaker 1>the w,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1487
01:03:51.130 --> 01:03:53.820
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ca in the group of them,</v>

1488
01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:56.610
<v Speaker 1>the elite of the elite there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so few.</v>

1489
01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:01.050
<v Speaker 1>It's a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really small club of individuals that</v>

1490
01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:05.550
<v Speaker 1>get to that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the vast majority of them are in</v>

1491
01:04:05.551 --> 01:04:09.270
<v Speaker 1>spectacular shape where they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly running trails.</v>

1492
01:04:09.420 --> 01:04:12.210
<v Speaker 1>There are constantly working out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're constantly in shape and the</v>

1493
01:04:12.211 --> 01:04:15.090
<v Speaker 1>reason being is if you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be successful in the</v>

1494
01:04:15.091 --> 01:04:17.780
<v Speaker 1>back country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the things that really haunt</v>

1495
01:04:17.790 --> 01:04:20.850
<v Speaker 1>them is when they can't get to an animal</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're out of shape.</v>

1496
01:04:21.150 --> 01:04:23.970
<v Speaker 1>And I've been there before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've tried that where I was like,</v>

1497
01:04:23.990 --> 01:04:26.070
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I was last year I was hunting with</v>

1498
01:04:26.090 --> 01:04:28.200
<v Speaker 1>cam and we went up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're trying to get to this elk,</v>

1499
01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:31.300
<v Speaker 1>and he ran up the hill like a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain goat and I'm halfway behind</v>

1500
01:04:31.301 --> 01:04:32.134
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1501
01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:36.840
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was in pretty good shape</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I am for the stuff I do,</v>

1502
01:04:37.110 --> 01:04:39.960
<v Speaker 1>but I wasn't in good shape for running</v>
<v Speaker 1>up hills.</v>

1503
01:04:40.470 --> 01:04:41.191
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotTa,</v>

1504
01:04:41.191 --> 01:04:43.860
<v Speaker 1>you gotta do that to be in shape for</v>
<v Speaker 1>running up hills.</v>

1505
01:04:43.861 --> 01:04:46.960
<v Speaker 1>You've got to run up hills and a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys there,</v>

1506
01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:48.930
<v Speaker 1>they have these uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>events,</v>

1507
01:04:49.170 --> 01:04:49.980
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1508
01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:52.740
<v Speaker 1>trained to hunt events that they do</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they compete against each other</v>

1509
01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:55.820
<v Speaker 1>and they put backpacks on and they run</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

1510
01:04:55.830 --> 01:04:58.170
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they try to get from point a to point b</v>

1511
01:04:58.171 --> 01:05:00.130
<v Speaker 1>faster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people are criticizing.</v>

1512
01:05:00.131 --> 01:05:02.970
<v Speaker 1>You think it's kind of dangerous and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because it's not really running</v>

1513
01:05:02.971 --> 01:05:04.980
<v Speaker 1>with weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the interest about it?</v>

1514
01:05:05.170 --> 01:05:06.870
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about still about the</v>

1515
01:05:06.871 --> 01:05:10.110
<v Speaker 1>barbell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The barbell things is completely new and</v>

1516
01:05:10.111 --> 01:05:11.810
<v Speaker 1>ventured by the outdoorsman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It,</v>

1517
01:05:11.830 --> 01:05:15.660
<v Speaker 1>it hasn't even come out yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most people just pack heavyweights</v>

1518
01:05:15.690 --> 01:05:18.370
<v Speaker 1>like sandbags and strap down at their</v>
<v Speaker 1>backpack.</v>

1519
01:05:19.330 --> 01:05:20.350
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

1520
01:05:20.530 --> 01:05:25.530
<v Speaker 1>it's a different world as far as like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the perception of what these people are</v>

1521
01:05:25.810 --> 01:05:29.980
<v Speaker 1>versus what they're actually doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a real ignorance when people</v>

1522
01:05:29.981 --> 01:05:32.890
<v Speaker 1>are talking about hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think of it as like this really</v>

1523
01:05:32.891 --> 01:05:35.350
<v Speaker 1>easy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just go shoot this animal.</v>

1524
01:05:35.351 --> 01:05:39.190
<v Speaker 1>And they think the hunters are cruel</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's what bad thing that</v>

1525
01:05:39.191 --> 01:05:43.090
<v Speaker 1>killed Bambi and you know what I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is weird ideas that people</v>

1526
01:05:43.091 --> 01:05:44.500
<v Speaker 1>have in their head about what hunting</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

1527
01:05:44.530 --> 01:05:47.260
<v Speaker 1>And I think in general that was kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>my impression of the,</v>

1528
01:05:47.261 --> 01:05:48.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess,</v>

1529
01:05:48.731 --> 01:05:50.580
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if easy is the right word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

1530
01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:51.760
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not physical.</v>

1531
01:05:51.761 --> 01:05:54.850
<v Speaker 1>Certainly enough physical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one would think from the outside</v>

1532
01:05:54.851 --> 01:05:58.420
<v Speaker 1>without really examining it and looking</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that you're talking about like elite</v>

1533
01:05:58.421 --> 01:06:02.050
<v Speaker 1>endurance athletes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you took the average person that</v>

1534
01:06:02.051 --> 01:06:04.660
<v Speaker 1>thinks they're in shape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I have friends that have done this</v>

1535
01:06:04.661 --> 01:06:06.550
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking people that think they're in</v>

1536
01:06:06.551 --> 01:06:07.960
<v Speaker 1>shape and take them on these hunts.</v>

1537
01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:10.240
<v Speaker 1>And these people break down slug.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1538
01:06:10.241 --> 01:06:11.680
<v Speaker 1>They just can't make it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can't do it.</v>

1539
01:06:11.681 --> 01:06:13.270
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just not prepared for it.</v>

1540
01:06:13.810 --> 01:06:15.170
<v Speaker 1>And it's hard to prepare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's,</v>

1541
01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:19.360
<v Speaker 1>they say there's very few things you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>do other than put weight on your back</v>

1542
01:06:19.361 --> 01:06:21.670
<v Speaker 1>and go up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go up and down hills and just do it.</v>

1543
01:06:21.730 --> 01:06:25.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people say boxes,</v>

1544
01:06:25.511 --> 01:06:26.344
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>steps,</v>

1545
01:06:26.650 --> 01:06:27.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things.</v>

1546
01:06:27.521 --> 01:06:30.220
<v Speaker 1>Like when people step up with one leg at</v>
<v Speaker 1>a gym,</v>

1547
01:06:30.350 --> 01:06:31.410
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they,</v>

1548
01:06:31.470 --> 01:06:34.780
<v Speaker 1>and they do that over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people say that that's a good way</v>

1549
01:06:34.781 --> 01:06:36.730
<v Speaker 1>to prepare for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for hiking as well.</v>

1550
01:06:37.090 --> 01:06:40.840
<v Speaker 1>Just box steps over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like commit to the.</v>

1551
01:06:41.200 --> 01:06:41.921
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1552
01:06:41.921 --> 01:06:43.640
<v Speaker 1>just get those quads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I run,</v>

1553
01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:45.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Weirdly in some ways.</v>

1554
01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:48.790
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trail bikes apparently very good like</v>

1555
01:06:48.850 --> 01:06:52.540
<v Speaker 1>doing dirt bike because you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>constantly pumping one leg at a time and</v>

1556
01:06:52.541 --> 01:06:57.541
<v Speaker 1>apparently that is very good for</v>
<v Speaker 1>mimicking the type of strength that you</v>

1557
01:06:58.091 --> 01:06:58.960
<v Speaker 1>need to get up.</v>

1558
01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:02.830
<v Speaker 1>And down hills goes back to like what</v>
<v Speaker 1>you said about just doing it though.</v>

1559
01:07:02.831 --> 01:07:03.850
<v Speaker 1>It's was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1560
01:07:03.910 --> 01:07:04.850
<v Speaker 1>just do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1561
01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:06.010
<v Speaker 1>it sucks though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1562
01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:10.060
<v Speaker 1>I did it the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did a five mile hike or four mile hike</v>

1563
01:07:10.061 --> 01:07:11.100
<v Speaker 1>and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the,</v>

1564
01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:16.110
<v Speaker 1>the whole one of the miles I did with my</v>
<v Speaker 1>daughter who's 50 pounds and from a mile</v>

1565
01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:19.600
<v Speaker 1>up the hill I carried her on my back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she worked.</v>

1566
01:07:19.870 --> 01:07:21.860
<v Speaker 1>She got tired and so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1567
01:07:21.861 --> 01:07:26.861
<v Speaker 1>I put her on my shoulders and I carried</v>
<v Speaker 1>her one mile straight up hill on my back</v>

1568
01:07:26.891 --> 01:07:29.160
<v Speaker 1>and all my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was drawn ranched.</v>

1569
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:30.760
<v Speaker 1>I mean my jet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my Hoodie,</v>

1570
01:07:30.761 --> 01:07:33.160
<v Speaker 1>I was wearing a hoodie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was soaked to the bone,</v>

1571
01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:38.080
<v Speaker 1>put sweat was pouring down my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was heaving as I was carrying her,</v>

1572
01:07:38.170 --> 01:07:40.450
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really interesting how difficult it</v>

1573
01:07:40.451 --> 01:07:42.790
<v Speaker 1>is because just the hike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kinda difficult,</v>

1574
01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:44.800
<v Speaker 1>but I could do it because I'm in pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>good shape.</v>

1575
01:07:44.950 --> 01:07:49.950
<v Speaker 1>But the hike with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 pound kid on your shoulders fucking a</v>

1576
01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:53.600
<v Speaker 1>thousand times harder of A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1577
01:07:53.710 --> 01:07:54.950
<v Speaker 1>it's hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I,</v>

1578
01:07:54.970 --> 01:07:57.460
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I used it as a workout and she's</v>

1579
01:07:57.461 --> 01:07:59.070
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're too tired you can stop.</v>

1580
01:07:59.090 --> 01:07:59.411
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1581
01:07:59.411 --> 01:08:00.310
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a good workout.</v>

1582
01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:01.420
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good for me.</v>

1583
01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:03.230
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was probably freaked her out here.</v>

1584
01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:07.410
<v Speaker 1>Maybe go</v>
<v Speaker 1>carrying or like thinking I'm going to</v>

1585
01:08:07.411 --> 01:08:08.860
<v Speaker 1>fall or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it wasn't,</v>

1586
01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:11.020
<v Speaker 1>wasn't dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it wasn't like I was,</v>

1587
01:08:11.570 --> 01:08:14.500
<v Speaker 1>my legs were failing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was breathing fucking heavy,</v>

1588
01:08:14.501 --> 01:08:16.880
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you've got to imagine these guys that</v>

1589
01:08:16.881 --> 01:08:21.881
<v Speaker 1>are carrying 20 pounds more than that</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're carrying their weight deep</v>

1590
01:08:22.191 --> 01:08:23.850
<v Speaker 1>into the mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1591
01:08:24.170 --> 01:08:26.420
<v Speaker 1>or the pack out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing.</v>

1592
01:08:26.421 --> 01:08:29.090
<v Speaker 1>When you kill an animal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you've got 100 pounds on your back</v>

1593
01:08:29.091 --> 01:08:32.510
<v Speaker 1>now and you've got to slowly but surely</v>
<v Speaker 1>make your way in.</v>

1594
01:08:32.511 --> 01:08:35.540
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys get seriously injured</v>
<v Speaker 1>during this.</v>

1595
01:08:35.690 --> 01:08:36.860
<v Speaker 2>Let's say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you do to drag it?</v>

1596
01:08:37.570 --> 01:08:40.310
<v Speaker 2>You put it in your backpack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One hundred pound animal</v>

1597
01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:43.810
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll know much more than a hundred</v>

1598
01:08:43.810 --> 01:08:47.050
<v Speaker 1>pound animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually any deer you shoot is going to</v>

1599
01:08:47.051 --> 01:08:50.200
<v Speaker 1>be more than 100 pounds and an elk is</v>
<v Speaker 1>way more than a hundred pounds.</v>

1600
01:08:50.500 --> 01:08:54.070
<v Speaker 1>So what you're doing is you're making</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple trips with 100 pounds on your</v>

1601
01:08:54.071 --> 01:08:54.970
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The heck it up.</v>

1602
01:08:55.420 --> 01:08:56.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to chop it up.</v>

1603
01:08:58.570 --> 01:09:01.570
<v Speaker 1>Now when it comes to like backpacks and</v>
<v Speaker 1>things along those lines,</v>

1604
01:09:01.571 --> 01:09:04.750
<v Speaker 1>like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you choose what kind of backpack</v>

1605
01:09:04.751 --> 01:09:05.720
<v Speaker 1>you need?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like you,</v>

1606
01:09:05.721 --> 01:09:08.350
<v Speaker 1>you must have like a weight</v>
<v Speaker 1>consideration as well.</v>

1607
01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:10.840
<v Speaker 1>And as far as volume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how much stuff you need.</v>

1608
01:09:10.841 --> 01:09:13.150
<v Speaker 1>You said you carry one change of</v>
<v Speaker 1>clothes,</v>

1609
01:09:13.151 --> 01:09:15.700
<v Speaker 1>so you basically have one pair of socks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one pair of underwear,</v>

1610
01:09:15.701 --> 01:09:17.830
<v Speaker 1>one pair of pants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other than stuff you have on,</v>

1611
01:09:17.831 --> 01:09:20.020
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you bring a change of shoes,</v>

1612
01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:24.290
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you typically break it up by activity so</v>

1613
01:09:24.291 --> 01:09:25.540
<v Speaker 2>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1614
01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:28.970
<v Speaker 2>hiking and sleeping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you have your hiking set of clothes</v>

1615
01:09:28.971 --> 01:09:31.400
<v Speaker 2>and gear and then you have your</v>
<v Speaker 2>sleeping.</v>

1616
01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:36.410
<v Speaker 2>So hiking clothes are usually like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like maybe like workout clothes,</v>

1617
01:09:36.411 --> 01:09:38.420
<v Speaker 2>like a synthetic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>short sleeve top,</v>

1618
01:09:38.810 --> 01:09:41.540
<v Speaker 2>maybe even running shorts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1619
01:09:41.690 --> 01:09:44.780
<v Speaker 2>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a set of socks to hike in and then your</v>

1620
01:09:44.781 --> 01:09:46.400
<v Speaker 2>trail runners to hike in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1621
01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:48.360
<v Speaker 2>it's Kinda like you're hiking attire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1622
01:09:48.820 --> 01:09:53.820
<v Speaker 2>I'm certainly not like the pant hiking</v>
<v Speaker 2>boot kind of image.</v>

1623
01:09:54.231 --> 01:09:54.910
<v Speaker 2>I think that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

1624
01:09:54.910 --> 01:09:55.840
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1625
01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:59.690
<v Speaker 2>going away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then you have your sleeping set of</v>

1626
01:09:59.691 --> 01:10:02.990
<v Speaker 2>closed your camp clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a typically like a very</v>

1627
01:10:02.991 --> 01:10:07.991
<v Speaker 2>minimalist camp shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all about weight because that's,</v>

1628
01:10:08.150 --> 01:10:10.380
<v Speaker 2>that piece of footwear is on your back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1629
01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:11.690
<v Speaker 2>So you want to make sure that one's</v>
<v Speaker 2>light,</v>

1630
01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:13.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so a lot of people even used crocs.</v>

1631
01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:15.260
<v Speaker 2>I know these crocs because it's super</v>
<v Speaker 2>light,</v>

1632
01:10:15.290 --> 01:10:17.630
<v Speaker 2>it's light and it's waterproof and walk</v>
<v Speaker 2>around camping.</v>

1633
01:10:17.670 --> 01:10:18.503
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then,</v>

1634
01:10:18.620 --> 01:10:19.700
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1635
01:10:19.701 --> 01:10:21.560
<v Speaker 2>some kind of wool,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like honestly this,</v>

1636
01:10:21.561 --> 01:10:24.800
<v Speaker 2>I love this book,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Merino Merino wool,</v>

1637
01:10:25.010 --> 01:10:28.190
<v Speaker 2>something warm to sleep in something dry</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1638
01:10:28.250 --> 01:10:30.410
<v Speaker 2>Those clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like get your hiking clothes,</v>

1639
01:10:30.411 --> 01:10:31.850
<v Speaker 2>wet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dirty all day long,</v>

1640
01:10:31.851 --> 01:10:34.040
<v Speaker 2>but when you come home or when you get</v>
<v Speaker 2>to camp at night,</v>

1641
01:10:34.041 --> 01:10:35.390
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>keep it,</v>

1642
01:10:35.391 --> 01:10:37.760
<v Speaker 2>make sure it's comfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>make sure it's drugs.</v>

1643
01:10:37.761 --> 01:10:40.940
<v Speaker 2>That's your saving grace if you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to sleep in wet clothes and</v>

1644
01:10:40.941 --> 01:10:41.774
<v Speaker 2>wintertime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1645
01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:42.940
<v Speaker 2>that's no good.</v>

1646
01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:44.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now why,</v>

1647
01:10:44.321 --> 01:10:45.430
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why synthetic?</v>

1648
01:10:45.431 --> 01:10:48.970
<v Speaker 1>Why do you choose synthetic?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I know a lot of people choose Marino</v>

1649
01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:51.340
<v Speaker 1>for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for hiking as well because it regulates</v>

1650
01:10:51.341 --> 01:10:52.061
<v Speaker 1>temperature.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1651
01:10:52.061 --> 01:10:54.610
<v Speaker 1>and when it's wet you could still stay</v>
<v Speaker 1>warm.</v>

1652
01:10:54.970 --> 01:10:55.720
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think you,</v>

1653
01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:57.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have arguments on both sides.</v>

1654
01:10:57.310 --> 01:10:59.950
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I personally like synthetic just because</v>

1655
01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:04.550
<v Speaker 2>I feel like it dries faster and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 2>little more durable like this is,</v>

1656
01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:06.130
<v Speaker 2>this would just tear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1657
01:11:06.131 --> 01:11:07.810
<v Speaker 2>and it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like getting down and dirty when I</v>

1658
01:11:07.811 --> 01:11:11.260
<v Speaker 2>hike and I'm like a synthetic shirt even</v>
<v Speaker 2>just from Walmart,</v>

1659
01:11:11.261 --> 01:11:11.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing,</v>

1660
01:11:11.830 --> 01:11:14.100
<v Speaker 2>nothing amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just delights lightweight since the</v>

1661
01:11:14.130 --> 01:11:15.810
<v Speaker 2>synthetic shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1662
01:11:15.811 --> 01:11:17.500
<v Speaker 2>I think it was just going to breathe and</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1663
01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:18.780
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1664
01:11:18.781 --> 01:11:22.110
<v Speaker 2>dry faster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I mean marina marina to and what</v>

1665
01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:26.070
<v Speaker 2>kind of package using a man I could</v>
<v Speaker 2>totally nerd out on packs.</v>

1666
01:11:26.071 --> 01:11:29.220
<v Speaker 2>I did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I used an osprey on actual 80 a hike.</v>

1667
01:11:29.221 --> 01:11:32.220
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to talk bad about Osprey</v>
<v Speaker 2>spray spray a lot,</v>

1668
01:11:32.221 --> 01:11:33.990
<v Speaker 2>but I would not hike with them again and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do,</v>

1669
01:11:33.991 --> 01:11:37.800
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how come a hate to be,</v>

1670
01:11:37.801 --> 01:11:38.730
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of,</v>

1671
01:11:38.731 --> 01:11:40.320
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from aesthetics,</v>

1672
01:11:40.321 --> 01:11:41.470
<v Speaker 2>but I just don't like the way they look.</v>

1673
01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:43.640
<v Speaker 2>Got This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've got this like,</v>

1674
01:11:43.960 --> 01:11:45.860
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that seems like the last thing that you</v>

1675
01:11:45.861 --> 01:11:48.240
<v Speaker 2>consider when you're wearing crocs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's true.</v>

1676
01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:49.870
<v Speaker 2>But they have this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1677
01:11:50.430 --> 01:11:52.950
<v Speaker 2>they kind of pride themselves and</v>
<v Speaker 2>breathable back.</v>

1678
01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:54.750
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm know that was pretty like they have</v>

1679
01:11:54.751 --> 01:11:58.180
<v Speaker 2>like that concave back and it just feels</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a,</v>

1680
01:11:58.290 --> 01:12:00.570
<v Speaker 2>like a turtle shell as can't stand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1681
01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:02.490
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I'm like falling back with</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

1682
01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:04.470
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the weight's not tight to your back.</v>

1683
01:12:04.471 --> 01:12:06.480
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want something snug on my back.</v>

1684
01:12:06.510 --> 01:12:07.740
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's not.</v>

1685
01:12:07.741 --> 01:12:10.560
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's a little utility.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not that's a big issue for utility.</v>

1686
01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:11.191
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1687
01:12:11.191 --> 01:12:12.900
<v Speaker 2>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just think they look weird to.</v>

1688
01:12:13.230 --> 01:12:14.190
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

1689
01:12:14.550 --> 01:12:17.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't like it looks bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what's the name of the practice?</v>

1690
01:12:17.761 --> 01:12:20.400
<v Speaker 2>We can pull it up a osprey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exos.</v>

1691
01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:22.960
<v Speaker 2>Fifty eight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1692
01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:24.960
<v Speaker 2>and so that's 5,800 liters.</v>

1693
01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:26.670
<v Speaker 2>Is that what it is?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's 58 liters.</v>

1694
01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:28.240
<v Speaker 2>Fifty eight liters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Liters.</v>

1695
01:12:28.260 --> 01:12:28.921
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then um,</v>

1696
01:12:28.921 --> 01:12:30.060
<v Speaker 2>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if I were to do it again,</v>

1697
01:12:30.290 --> 01:12:34.080
<v Speaker 2>there are a handful of pretty bad ass</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultra light pat companies.</v>

1698
01:12:34.081 --> 01:12:35.720
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got this bell curve of like</v>

1699
01:12:36.030 --> 01:12:39.480
<v Speaker 2>Osprey is like the majority of</v>
<v Speaker 2>backpackers and it's like you get into</v>

1700
01:12:39.481 --> 01:12:42.980
<v Speaker 2>like that niche ultra light and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got like a handful too.</v>

1701
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.150
<v Speaker 2>There.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is appealing.</v>

1702
01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:45.473
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1703
01:12:46.650 --> 01:12:50.760
<v Speaker 2>So that's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just looks like a space in between the</v>

1704
01:12:50.761 --> 01:12:51.700
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

1705
01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:54.540
<v Speaker 2>I'm not into that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's just for breathability.</v>

1706
01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:55.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's like,</v>

1707
01:12:55.650 --> 01:12:56.610
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're sweaty pig.</v>

1708
01:12:56.611 --> 01:12:58.430
<v Speaker 2>No matter how you look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't,</v>

1709
01:12:58.440 --> 01:13:01.380
<v Speaker 2>I just don't see the argument for</v>
<v Speaker 2>breathability back there.</v>

1710
01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:03.480
<v Speaker 2>There's some people like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Definitely.</v>

1711
01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:07.200
<v Speaker 2>So it's just a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's maybe personal preference.</v>

1712
01:13:07.230 --> 01:13:09.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what is like,</v>

1713
01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:11.490
<v Speaker 2>what's the elite of the elite?</v>

1714
01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:13.010
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could,</v>

1715
01:13:13.010 --> 01:13:16.740
<v Speaker 2>I would probably say like four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a hyperlink mountain gear,</v>

1716
01:13:17.550 --> 01:13:18.383
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they make.</v>

1717
01:13:18.390 --> 01:13:20.550
<v Speaker 2>What's a Cuban fiber?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know?</v>

1718
01:13:20.551 --> 01:13:21.630
<v Speaker 2>Cuban fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the material,</v>

1719
01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:23.240
<v Speaker 2>Cuban,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cuban fiber.</v>

1720
01:13:23.241 --> 01:13:25.220
<v Speaker 2>It's called Dyneema now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's okay.</v>

1721
01:13:25.221 --> 01:13:29.090
<v Speaker 2>I've heard of Dyneema Dyneema for um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both strings.</v>

1722
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:30.530
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

1723
01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:32.430
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1724
01:13:32.710 --> 01:13:33.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's lightweight,</v>

1725
01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:36.420
<v Speaker 2>strong on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're super expensive.</v>

1726
01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:38.820
<v Speaker 2>Hyperlight mountain gear mix.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like their packs.</v>

1727
01:13:39.210 --> 01:13:41.040
<v Speaker 2>Gossamer gear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make great packs,</v>

1728
01:13:41.041 --> 01:13:45.750
<v Speaker 2>a little more affordable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Super lightweight granite gear.</v>

1729
01:13:46.230 --> 01:13:48.240
<v Speaker 2>It's another one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then ula equipment,</v>

1730
01:13:48.790 --> 01:13:51.600
<v Speaker 2>was it probably be the four pack</v>
<v Speaker 2>companies I'd,</v>

1731
01:13:51.601 --> 01:13:52.560
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd want,</v>

1732
01:13:52.590 --> 01:13:54.410
<v Speaker 2>I'd want to use for the next cycle</v>
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>

1733
01:13:54.411 --> 01:13:56.570
<v Speaker 2>if there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there a cost,</v>

1734
01:13:56.571 --> 01:14:00.320
<v Speaker 2>not an option.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Best best one or is it just all four of</v>

1735
01:14:00.321 --> 01:14:03.440
<v Speaker 2>them are really similar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even the guy,</v>

1736
01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:04.890
<v Speaker 2>the gossamer gear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mariposa,</v>

1737
01:14:04.950 --> 01:14:07.950
<v Speaker 2>that's a model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're probably more affordable than</v>

1738
01:14:07.951 --> 01:14:10.200
<v Speaker 2>some of the other options.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd probably like it the most.</v>

1739
01:14:11.710 --> 01:14:13.240
<v Speaker 2>So yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even even if money wouldn't,</v>

1740
01:14:13.241 --> 01:14:14.500
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>money wasn't an issue there,</v>

1741
01:14:14.590 --> 01:14:16.720
<v Speaker 1>so one of the more affordable packs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>make the best.</v>

1742
01:14:16.930 --> 01:14:21.190
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting about pacs is a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it is like where it centers the</v>

1743
01:14:21.191 --> 01:14:25.810
<v Speaker 1>weight on you and you can make one pack</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the same amount of weight would</v>

1744
01:14:25.811 --> 01:14:30.811
<v Speaker 1>feel lighter than another pack just by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way it's designed and the way the</v>

1745
01:14:31.241 --> 01:14:33.880
<v Speaker 1>load lifters work and all that jazz and</v>
<v Speaker 1>your torso length,</v>

1746
01:14:33.881 --> 01:14:36.160
<v Speaker 1>like you know what fit you might not fit</v>
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

1747
01:14:36.161 --> 01:14:36.994
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1748
01:14:37.210 --> 01:14:38.043
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1749
01:14:38.290 --> 01:14:39.600
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went backpacking with my girlfriend.</v>

1750
01:14:39.601 --> 01:14:42.460
<v Speaker 1>I gave her some of my pecs and her torso</v>
<v Speaker 1>just so much shorter than mine.</v>

1751
01:14:42.910 --> 01:14:45.790
<v Speaker 1>Like the hip belt wasn't working</v>
<v Speaker 1>properly so she can rest the weight on</v>

1752
01:14:45.791 --> 01:14:48.580
<v Speaker 1>her hips and then it's all on her</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulders and then she's like,</v>

1753
01:14:48.581 --> 01:14:49.630
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sucks.</v>

1754
01:14:49.631 --> 01:14:52.180
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the best picks up there,</v>

1755
01:14:52.181 --> 01:14:53.590
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you have to,</v>

1756
01:14:53.710 --> 01:14:57.310
<v Speaker 1>can you adjust it for her or is it just</v>
<v Speaker 1>needs a bit different path?</v>

1757
01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:59.410
<v Speaker 1>I did different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need different says hm.</v>

1758
01:14:59.411 --> 01:15:03.220
<v Speaker 1>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do you know what to choose?</v>

1759
01:15:03.221 --> 01:15:04.630
<v Speaker 1>You have to just try them out.</v>

1760
01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:06.180
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would.</v>

1761
01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:07.860
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to try them out.</v>

1762
01:15:07.861 --> 01:15:10.380
<v Speaker 2>And it's hard to do because like your</v>
<v Speaker 2>local Rei,</v>

1763
01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:12.470
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if</v>

1764
01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:19.160
<v Speaker 2>they don't carry those kind of niche</v>
<v Speaker 2>ultralight Pepsi can't go try them on.</v>

1765
01:15:19.170 --> 01:15:20.260
<v Speaker 2>They care,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll carry on,</v>

1766
01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:22.440
<v Speaker 2>they'll carry osprey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1767
01:15:22.441 --> 01:15:24.180
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Try him on measure torso link.</v>

1768
01:15:24.190 --> 01:15:28.200
<v Speaker 2>Some of those online retailers have ways</v>
<v Speaker 2>to measure your torso length,</v>

1769
01:15:28.230 --> 01:15:29.820
<v Speaker 2>makes sure it fits right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But still at the end of the day,</v>

1770
01:15:29.821 --> 01:15:32.040
<v Speaker 2>it's like a pair of shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta you gotta try them on.</v>

1771
01:15:32.041 --> 01:15:32.550
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1772
01:15:32.550 --> 01:15:37.470
<v Speaker 1>it's interesting because hunters in</v>
<v Speaker 1>general do not use the same packs that</v>

1773
01:15:37.471 --> 01:15:41.100
<v Speaker 1>backpackers use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably more holsters and all sorts of</v>

1774
01:15:41.101 --> 01:15:43.290
<v Speaker 1>stuff you need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your needs are different I would</v>

1775
01:15:43.291 --> 01:15:43.950
<v Speaker 1>imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1776
01:15:43.950 --> 01:15:45.720
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the most part.</v>

1777
01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:50.370
<v Speaker 1>But a lot of it is like certain things</v>
<v Speaker 1>you strapped to the pack,</v>

1778
01:15:50.670 --> 01:15:54.060
<v Speaker 1>like you strap your boat or your pack</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some of them have like rifle</v>

1779
01:15:54.061 --> 01:15:56.520
<v Speaker 1>holsters or rifle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1780
01:15:56.521 --> 01:16:00.340
<v Speaker 1>scabbards that you can kind of contain a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rifle and like a lot of them have a</v>

1781
01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:05.400
<v Speaker 1>little packets or air areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We get strapped down and tripod or maybe</v>

1782
01:16:05.401 --> 01:16:09.870
<v Speaker 1>the top compartment you would keep your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your binoculars or something along those</v>

1783
01:16:09.871 --> 01:16:11.670
<v Speaker 1>lines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I would think that there would be</v>

1784
01:16:11.671 --> 01:16:16.530
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of crossover and there's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's exclusive sort of segment of the</v>

1785
01:16:16.531 --> 01:16:19.530
<v Speaker 1>population or of the market rather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>

1786
01:16:19.531 --> 01:16:20.620
<v Speaker 1>Is it just marketing it?</v>

1787
01:16:20.630 --> 01:16:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Just targeting different audience?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know because I wouldn't think</v>

1788
01:16:23.371 --> 01:16:26.580
<v Speaker 1>that that would be the case because it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the case really with boots that much</v>

1789
01:16:26.640 --> 01:16:30.780
<v Speaker 1>as a lot of people use like Solomon's</v>
<v Speaker 1>and really standard hiking boots.</v>

1790
01:16:30.781 --> 01:16:35.670
<v Speaker 1>There are hunting boots like crispy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kenna track and there's a few of those</v>

1791
01:16:35.671 --> 01:16:38.970
<v Speaker 1>that are like specifically designed</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] snake.</v>

1792
01:16:39.130 --> 01:16:40.650
<v Speaker 1>Like people use using for other things</v>
<v Speaker 1>too,</v>

1793
01:16:40.651 --> 01:16:43.260
<v Speaker 1>but they're like really well known in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hunting world.</v>

1794
01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:47.040
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the markets will start blending,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder,</v>

1795
01:16:47.041 --> 01:16:50.640
<v Speaker 1>but I'm just wondering like you would</v>
<v Speaker 1>think you would go to those guys,</v>

1796
01:16:50.641 --> 01:16:52.100
<v Speaker 1>the backpackers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

1797
01:16:52.101 --> 01:16:56.070
<v Speaker 1>the Appalachian trail people like they</v>
<v Speaker 1>would have already done the work.</v>

1798
01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:58.500
<v Speaker 1>I would think that that's the people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>contact.</v>

1799
01:16:58.800 --> 01:16:59.940
<v Speaker 1>They know what's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1800
01:16:59.941 --> 01:17:02.130
<v Speaker 1>They're traveling for seven fucking</v>
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

1801
01:17:02.710 --> 01:17:03.780
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

1802
01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:06.600
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you take like a nalgene bottle or</v>

1803
01:17:06.601 --> 01:17:09.070
<v Speaker 1>something like that with you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like smart water bottles?</v>

1804
01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:10.310
<v Speaker 1>Smart water.</v>

1805
01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:11.300
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really?</v>

1806
01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:12.150
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1807
01:17:12.150 --> 01:17:14.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean these water bottles are fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1808
01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:17.030
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I like smart water because you talked</v>

1809
01:17:17.031 --> 01:17:18.680
<v Speaker 2>about that filter then sell your</v>
<v Speaker 2>squeeze.</v>

1810
01:17:18.681 --> 01:17:21.230
<v Speaker 2>We were talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It matches water bottle threads.</v>

1811
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:25.190
<v Speaker 2>But the problem like with like this</v>
<v Speaker 2>bottle specifically is it goes around</v>

1812
01:17:25.191 --> 01:17:26.480
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like two and a half,</v>

1813
01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:30.830
<v Speaker 2>maybe one and a half times around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like smart water bottles.</v>

1814
01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:33.950
<v Speaker 2>This piece is about that long and it's</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like much,</v>

1815
01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:37.250
<v Speaker 2>much better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's much more secure so it's like more</v>

1816
01:17:37.260 --> 01:17:39.200
<v Speaker 2>threads threads to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to secure it.</v>

1817
01:17:39.201 --> 01:17:40.440
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So there's not gonna be any,</v>

1818
01:17:40.441 --> 01:17:44.060
<v Speaker 2>any leak or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy to think that that all you</v>

1819
01:17:44.061 --> 01:17:48.020
<v Speaker 2>have to do is squeeze the water,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like how long does it take to do like a,</v>

1820
01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:51.020
<v Speaker 2>a one liter thing of water and that's</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biggest,</v>

1821
01:17:51.050 --> 01:17:54.520
<v Speaker 2>that's the biggest con with that</v>
<v Speaker 2>specific type of filters.</v>

1822
01:17:54.530 --> 01:17:57.820
<v Speaker 2>The fact that you have to manually do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it can take awhile.</v>

1823
01:17:57.830 --> 01:18:00.620
<v Speaker 2>So if you had a group of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's say you wanted to go with your,</v>

1824
01:18:00.621 --> 01:18:03.110
<v Speaker 2>with your kids backpacking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I don't know if I'd recommend that</v>

1825
01:18:03.111 --> 01:18:05.450
<v Speaker 2>filter because you're gonna have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>squeeze all their water through that one</v>

1826
01:18:05.451 --> 01:18:07.100
<v Speaker 2>little filter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if it's just you and you're trying</v>

1827
01:18:07.101 --> 01:18:09.230
<v Speaker 2>to squeeze a half a liter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a liter at a time,</v>

1828
01:18:09.231 --> 01:18:10.050
<v Speaker 2>like it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1829
01:18:10.050 --> 01:18:12.620
<v Speaker 2>might take a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've seen those gravity filters to.</v>

1830
01:18:12.930 --> 01:18:14.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like who you're going with your family</v>

1831
01:18:14.781 --> 01:18:16.730
<v Speaker 2>or something and you have to do more</v>
<v Speaker 2>volume of water.</v>

1832
01:18:16.731 --> 01:18:19.010
<v Speaker 2>I'd probably go gravity filter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here it is right here.</v>

1833
01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:21.800
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So your squeeze water filtration system,</v>

1834
01:18:21.801 --> 01:18:23.690
<v Speaker 2>there's a video of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1835
01:18:23.750 --> 01:18:25.670
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it squeezes into a bag.</v>

1836
01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:29.180
<v Speaker 2>So you fill the water bottle up and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>you squeeze it.</v>

1837
01:18:29.181 --> 01:18:30.440
<v Speaker 2>And then it fills that bag.</v>

1838
01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:32.980
<v Speaker 2>So do you use one of those?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1839
01:18:33.250 --> 01:18:35.690
<v Speaker 2>so the manufacturer bag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1840
01:18:35.740 --> 01:18:38.000
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you use one of those tubes?</v>

1841
01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:39.620
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what is it?</v>

1842
01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:41.930
<v Speaker 2>What's going on right there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the clean water coming out.</v>

1843
01:18:43.220 --> 01:18:44.450
<v Speaker 2>I see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I see.</v>

1844
01:18:45.050 --> 01:18:45.883
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that's it.</v>

1845
01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:48.830
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you fill the bag up and he squeezed</v>

1846
01:18:48.831 --> 01:18:50.780
<v Speaker 2>that thing and then it comes out the</v>
<v Speaker 2>end.</v>

1847
01:18:51.050 --> 01:18:53.630
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty good stuff.</v>

1848
01:18:53.890 --> 01:18:55.940
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing that that's all you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do.</v>

1849
01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:58.790
<v Speaker 2>I would think there's a bunch of bears</v>
<v Speaker 2>shitting in that water.</v>

1850
01:18:59.070 --> 01:19:01.130
<v Speaker 2>Like what are the odds that you could</v>
<v Speaker 2>just do that?</v>

1851
01:19:01.610 --> 01:19:02.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's crazy.</v>

1852
01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:04.560
<v Speaker 2>I think they're marketing more towards</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1853
01:19:04.570 --> 01:19:06.020
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>know like Africa and stuff.</v>

1854
01:19:06.030 --> 01:19:06.863
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

1855
01:19:07.130 --> 01:19:09.590
<v Speaker 2>If you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have a water source that's</v>

1856
01:19:09.591 --> 01:19:12.290
<v Speaker 2>polluted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you can start to get water for</v>

1857
01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:12.910
<v Speaker 2>village,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1858
01:19:12.910 --> 01:19:16.330
<v Speaker 2>it's like just squeeze it through in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>head like a warranty of uh,</v>

1859
01:19:16.810 --> 01:19:18.740
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some insane amount of water can go</v>

1860
01:19:18.741 --> 01:19:19.740
<v Speaker 2>through there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1861
01:19:20.210 --> 01:19:22.360
<v Speaker 2>And then what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You have to change the filters.</v>

1862
01:19:23.340 --> 01:19:25.230
<v Speaker 2>Just throw it away and get another one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like,</v>

1863
01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:26.620
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>40 bucks.</v>

1864
01:19:26.630 --> 01:19:27.381
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good,</v>

1865
01:19:27.381 --> 01:19:29.300
<v Speaker 2>another good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>another filter every 10 years.</v>

1866
01:19:30.710 --> 01:19:33.030
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think their warranty is like,</v>

1867
01:19:33.570 --> 01:19:36.200
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what to throw out a number,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's like a million gallons of just</v>

1868
01:19:36.201 --> 01:19:40.340
<v Speaker 2>something ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That little thing can go through a</v>

1869
01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:43.070
<v Speaker 2>million gallons of water.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that filter smell like after</v>

1870
01:19:43.071 --> 01:19:44.960
<v Speaker 2>the ads that you're supposed to back</v>
<v Speaker 2>flush it.</v>

1871
01:19:44.961 --> 01:19:47.080
<v Speaker 2>Like my back flows when you back flushed</v>
<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>

1872
01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:48.410
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got the one way,</v>

1873
01:19:48.411 --> 01:19:51.950
<v Speaker 2>the dirty water goes through this way</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you just push through the crap right</v>

1874
01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:55.270
<v Speaker 2>out the other way and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you do that on mine,</v>

1875
01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:57.770
<v Speaker 2>like it was just black water coming out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1876
01:19:58.670 --> 01:20:00.420
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting to think like all that</v>
<v Speaker 2>black water.</v>

1877
01:20:00.421 --> 01:20:03.020
<v Speaker 2>It's just filtered out of what looks</v>
<v Speaker 2>like clean water,</v>

1878
01:20:03.050 --> 01:20:05.810
<v Speaker 2>clean water in the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that is interesting.</v>

1879
01:20:05.811 --> 01:20:07.500
<v Speaker 2>Well it's also like you ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

1880
01:20:07.610 --> 01:20:08.130
<v Speaker 2>especially</v>

1881
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:09.960
<v Speaker 1>in Los Angeles is a great example of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1882
01:20:10.260 --> 01:20:15.260
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever gone to the hills and look</v>
<v Speaker 1>down on the basin of the La area and you</v>

1883
01:20:15.841 --> 01:20:18.360
<v Speaker 1>see that Brown air?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1884
01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:20.640
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you're there,</v>

1885
01:20:20.750 --> 01:20:22.170
<v Speaker 1>you don't see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks normal.</v>

1886
01:20:22.480 --> 01:20:23.600
<v Speaker 1>Walking around Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

1887
01:20:23.610 --> 01:20:25.080
<v Speaker 1>oh look air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can see right through it.</v>

1888
01:20:25.081 --> 01:20:27.890
<v Speaker 1>Your lungs are doing the same thing that</v>
<v Speaker 1>filters dylan like</v>

1889
01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:31.740
<v Speaker 1>brake dust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing.</v>

1890
01:20:31.810 --> 01:20:35.490
<v Speaker 1>The brake dust apparently is a real</v>
<v Speaker 1>issue with New York City and places</v>

1891
01:20:35.491 --> 01:20:38.490
<v Speaker 1>where you have real congestion in tight</v>
<v Speaker 1>areas.</v>

1892
01:20:38.850 --> 01:20:42.180
<v Speaker 1>You're breathing in a lot of dust from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the breaks of the cars.</v>

1893
01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:45.190
<v Speaker 1>Had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1894
01:20:45.210 --> 01:20:46.480
<v Speaker 1>I didn't either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1895
01:20:46.770 --> 01:20:51.390
<v Speaker 1>I saw some of that smoke coming into La</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a connected it in Mexico City when I</v>

1896
01:20:51.391 --> 01:20:54.310
<v Speaker 1>was coming here in Mexico City was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same way.</v>

1897
01:20:54.360 --> 01:20:59.360
<v Speaker 1>Mexico City was just like worst Mexico</v>
<v Speaker 1>cities like la is going to be in</v>

1898
01:20:59.431 --> 01:21:00.630
<v Speaker 1>probably 20 or 30 years.</v>

1899
01:21:00.630 --> 01:21:02.100
<v Speaker 1>What's it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's going on with the politics over</v>

1900
01:21:02.101 --> 01:21:04.140
<v Speaker 1>here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I figured Joe would be clean air and</v>

1901
01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:08.730
<v Speaker 1>organic and not much we could do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you get the volume of people that</v>

1902
01:21:08.731 --> 01:21:11.460
<v Speaker 1>are here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of humans in La apparently</v>

1903
01:21:11.520 --> 01:21:15.540
<v Speaker 1>though the base in like especially like</v>
<v Speaker 1>the valley has always been like that.</v>

1904
01:21:15.541 --> 01:21:18.840
<v Speaker 1>It's always been kinda like a dust bowl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just by the way it's shaped even back</v>

1905
01:21:18.841 --> 01:21:21.960
<v Speaker 1>before there were cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people always complained about the brown</v>

1906
01:21:21.961 --> 01:21:26.961
<v Speaker 1>air just from literally from dust and</v>
<v Speaker 1>dirt and wind and the dry air and the</v>

1907
01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:30.780
<v Speaker 1>lack of moisture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the the dirt kicks up easy with the</v>

1908
01:21:30.781 --> 01:21:33.090
<v Speaker 1>wind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you add that with pollution as</v>

1909
01:21:33.091 --> 01:21:35.920
<v Speaker 1>well growth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we have $20,</v>

1910
01:21:35.921 --> 01:21:38.700
<v Speaker 1>million plus people in this tiny little</v>
<v Speaker 1>area.</v>

1911
01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:39.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1912
01:21:39.540 --> 01:21:44.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean literally we have as many people</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the entire country of Australia in</v>

1913
01:21:45.601 --> 01:21:46.740
<v Speaker 1>the La area.</v>

1914
01:21:46.890 --> 01:21:49.200
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucking really crazy.</v>

1915
01:21:49.710 --> 01:21:52.800
<v Speaker 1>There's just too many.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now now that trump has lightened</v>

1916
01:21:52.801 --> 01:21:57.030
<v Speaker 1>that EPA protection standards and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

1917
01:21:57.031 --> 01:21:59.820
<v Speaker 1>they're changing the standards of</v>
<v Speaker 1>automobiles.</v>

1918
01:21:59.821 --> 01:22:04.770
<v Speaker 1>What automobiles need to achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So supposedly to help business,</v>

1919
01:22:04.771 --> 01:22:06.300
<v Speaker 1>but fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What cost?</v>

1920
01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:08.040
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that seems like a short term</v>

1921
01:22:08.041 --> 01:22:10.320
<v Speaker 1>solution to a longterm problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terrible idea.</v>

1922
01:22:10.450 --> 01:22:13.260
<v Speaker 1>Terrible idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a reason why people,</v>

1923
01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:18.030
<v Speaker 1>why they set those standards and they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to achieve cleaner and cleaner</v>

1924
01:22:18.031 --> 01:22:19.530
<v Speaker 1>standard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like if you go back,</v>

1925
01:22:19.531 --> 01:22:21.960
<v Speaker 1>apparently the 19 seventies in Los</v>
<v Speaker 1>Angeles,</v>

1926
01:22:21.961 --> 01:22:24.990
<v Speaker 1>the traffic was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was pollution was way worse because</v>

1927
01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:29.280
<v Speaker 1>when you're around those cars you ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>been around like old old cars like you</v>

1928
01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:31.020
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1970 car.</v>

1929
01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:33.030
<v Speaker 1>Not particularly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now when you're around them,</v>

1930
01:22:33.031 --> 01:22:38.031
<v Speaker 1>apparently just an old car like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just sitting around a Po produces</v>

1931
01:22:39.061 --> 01:22:42.120
<v Speaker 1>pollution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even driving because the gas tank is</v>

1932
01:22:42.121 --> 01:22:46.260
<v Speaker 1>not airtight and fucking fumes leak out</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the environment,</v>

1933
01:22:46.290 --> 01:22:48.030
<v Speaker 1>just the oil.</v>

1934
01:22:48.030 --> 01:22:50.370
<v Speaker 1>Those things are always leaking oil and</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>

1935
01:22:50.371 --> 01:22:52.620
<v Speaker 1>When they drive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just traps.</v>

1936
01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:55.830
<v Speaker 1>That is disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's just fire.</v>

1937
01:22:56.010 --> 01:22:59.880
<v Speaker 1>I mean they're basically just burning</v>
<v Speaker 1>gasoline is coming out the back and so</v>

1938
01:22:59.881 --> 01:23:01.730
<v Speaker 1>why are they different?</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of that regulations.</v>

1939
01:23:01.980 --> 01:23:04.710
<v Speaker 1>That's Manhattan from 1966.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1940
01:23:04.860 --> 01:23:06.550
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's those old cars,</v>

1941
01:23:06.551 --> 01:23:09.790
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Old Cars were fucking terrible and</v>

1942
01:23:09.791 --> 01:23:14.791
<v Speaker 1>regulations fixed a lot of that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the upper right hand corner is as</v>

1943
01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:20.040
<v Speaker 1>Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got that fucking smog in La and it's</v>

1944
01:23:20.711 --> 01:23:22.900
<v Speaker 1>going to get worse now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mean he was getting better,</v>

1945
01:23:22.930 --> 01:23:25.060
<v Speaker 1>but it's going to get worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1946
01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:30.360
<v Speaker 1>if he really does succeed in lowering</v>
<v Speaker 1>the standards,</v>

1947
01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:32.380
<v Speaker 1>the emission standards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're China.</v>

1948
01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:35.650
<v Speaker 1>China is awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just about to say visioning of you</v>

1949
01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:39.430
<v Speaker 1>who've been to China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've watched a documentary literally.</v>

1950
01:23:39.431 --> 01:23:41.290
<v Speaker 1>I literally like when I was in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was years ago,</v>

1951
01:23:41.291 --> 01:23:43.480
<v Speaker 1>but when I was in China I was just like</v>
<v Speaker 1>sick,</v>

1952
01:23:43.481 --> 01:23:45.910
<v Speaker 1>literally sick.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I was talking with a gravel voice.</v>

1953
01:23:45.911 --> 01:23:47.940
<v Speaker 1>It's just like people live there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1954
01:23:47.941 --> 01:23:50.480
<v Speaker 1>like every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1955
01:23:50.530 --> 01:23:53.770
<v Speaker 1>no things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that is got to be one thing that's</v>

1956
01:23:53.771 --> 01:23:56.980
<v Speaker 1>positive about doing the Appalachian</v>
<v Speaker 1>trail is that you're constantly in</v>

1957
01:23:56.981 --> 01:24:01.000
<v Speaker 1>nature and you're constantly around all</v>
<v Speaker 1>those trees and the walking through the</v>

1958
01:24:01.001 --> 01:24:03.670
<v Speaker 1>mountains and the healthy stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1959
01:24:03.970 --> 01:24:07.000
<v Speaker 1>You're drinking like A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to say that'll stream</v>

1960
01:24:07.001 --> 01:24:08.200
<v Speaker 1>waters clean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

1961
01:24:08.201 --> 01:24:09.040
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're drinking</v>

1962

<v Speaker 2>you're surrounded by trees all the time.</v>

1963
01:24:11.611 --> 01:24:13.950
<v Speaker 2>You're not near city lights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like air pollution.</v>

1964
01:24:13.960 --> 01:24:17.340
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you're exercising every day,</v>

1967
01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:22.070
<v Speaker 1>in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it lets you start talking about</v>

1968
01:24:22.071 --> 01:24:26.300
<v Speaker 1>stress fractures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you quit your job,</v>

<v Speaker 2>So you live in Guatemala,</v>

1978
01:24:47.710 --> 01:24:49.790
<v Speaker 2>kind of a loose term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1979
01:24:49.791 --> 01:24:50.570
<v Speaker 2>living,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I don't know if I identify myself as</v>

1982
01:24:55.821 --> 01:24:57.140
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that kind of movement of,</v>

1983
01:24:57.710 --> 01:25:02.570
<v Speaker 2>of working online and working remotely</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I can truly operate most of the</v>

1984
01:25:02.571 --> 01:25:04.550
<v Speaker 2>business on online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1985
01:25:04.580 --> 01:25:08.060

<v Speaker 2>it's like nowhere is off limits,</v>

1986
01:25:08.090 --> 01:25:10.430

01:26:17.211 --> 01:26:20.210
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii where they moved to Hawaii and</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to operate out of there.</v>

2013
01:26:20.211 --> 01:26:23.060

<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2028
01:26:46.030 --> 01:26:48.880

<v Speaker 2>some sense of stability in an</v>

2029
01:26:48.881 --> 01:26:51.700
<v Speaker 2>environment would be good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But for now it's fantastic.</v>

2030
01:26:51.730 --> 01:26:55.390
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely good for the kids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether it be you're an adult,</v>

2031
01:26:55.420 --> 01:26:56.710

<v Speaker 1>being free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could just pull up stakes,</v>

2036
01:27:07.050 --> 01:27:09.220
<v Speaker 1>throw your shit in a backpack and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>gone.</v>

2061
01:28:09.650 --> 01:28:14.650
<v Speaker 1>It's a fascinating idea that mean people</v>
<v Speaker 1>are so attached to the idea of</v>

2062
01:28:14.911 --> 01:28:17.640
<v Speaker 1>permanence when it's not real.</v>

<v Speaker 1>no matter what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will die.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Feathered your nest with.</v>

2066
01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:28.500
<v Speaker 1>It's not real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you're not going to keep it</v>

<v Speaker 1>Costs like five bucks a year.</v>

2070
01:28:36.430 --> 01:28:38.000
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a plus.</v>

2074
01:28:41.601 --> 01:28:43.520
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I do like the idea of being somewhat</v>

2075
01:28:43.570 --> 01:28:46.460
<v Speaker 2>a somewhat close to Georgia stuff needed</v>
<v Speaker 2>to come home.</v>

<v Speaker 1>So you can get.</v>

2078
01:28:52.861 --> 01:28:55.920
<v Speaker 1>They're almost the same as like living</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the east coast and flying to the</v>

2079
01:28:55.921 --> 01:28:56.410
<v Speaker 1>west.</v>

2080
01:28:56.410 --> 01:28:57.920
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the same time zone.</v>

2081
01:28:57.921 --> 01:29:00.080
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's cheap and it's like all of these</v>

2082
01:29:00.081 --> 01:29:05.081
<v Speaker 2>volcanoes around you hike all day long</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's like the coolest thing about</v>

2083
01:29:05.580 --> 01:29:07.580
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm an antiwar right now in tig was like</v>

2084
01:29:08.010 --> 01:29:09.500
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've,</v>

2085
01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:12.660
<v Speaker 2>there are several South American cities</v>
<v Speaker 2>like this or Central American cities and</v>

2086
01:29:12.661 --> 01:29:17.661
<v Speaker 2>they have the close to the equator.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have hot temperature all year</v>

2087
01:29:18.601 --> 01:29:19.660
<v Speaker 2>long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of like a Megas,</v>

2088
01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:21.150
<v Speaker 2>California.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're spoiled with it,</v>

2089
01:29:21.151 --> 01:29:21.984
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2090
01:29:22.060 --> 01:29:25.320
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Antigua specifically is that several</v>

2091
01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:27.960
<v Speaker 2>thousand feet of elevation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have that consistent,</v>

2092
01:29:27.961 --> 01:29:30.060
<v Speaker 2>whether you're long,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however you are.</v>

2093
01:29:30.061 --> 01:29:32.760
<v Speaker 2>It's not 100 degrees every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>

2094
01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:33.480
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

2095
01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:35.940
<v Speaker 2>it's very similar to here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like 75 degrees every day.</v>

2096
01:29:35.941 --> 01:29:38.520
<v Speaker 2>It's like 60 at night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He speaks Spanish</v>

2097
01:29:40.100 --> 01:29:43.140
<v Speaker 2>when Poquito really I would think you</v>
<v Speaker 2>would learn these.</v>

2098
01:29:43.141 --> 01:29:45.600
<v Speaker 2>Speaks Spanish now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I know fornia</v>

2099
01:29:47.130 --> 01:29:49.230
<v Speaker 2>Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My Spanish is horrible.</v>

2100
01:29:49.230 --> 01:29:50.910
<v Speaker 2>I believe in dead like two months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2101
01:29:50.911 --> 01:29:52.050
<v Speaker 2>like I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't,</v>

2102
01:29:53.480 --> 01:29:55.770
<v Speaker 2>I haven't picked it up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then I just got back from Cabo and I</v>

2103
01:29:55.771 --> 01:29:57.990
<v Speaker 2>felt bad that I didn't speak Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was down there.</v>

2104
01:29:58.140 --> 01:29:58.980
<v Speaker 2>I tried,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2105
01:29:59.010 --> 01:30:03.990
<v Speaker 2>I did the whole garage down there just a</v>
<v Speaker 2>week but a weekend.</v>

2106
01:30:04.230 --> 01:30:05.160
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I would like,</v>

2107
01:30:05.550 --> 01:30:08.790
<v Speaker 2>I would think like if you stayed there</v>
<v Speaker 2>for any length of time,</v>

2108
01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:10.560
<v Speaker 2>like I have a friend who has a house</v>
<v Speaker 2>there,</v>

2109
01:30:10.561 --> 01:30:12.690
<v Speaker 2>it keeps house there and they go there</v>
<v Speaker 2>every month.</v>

2110
01:30:12.750 --> 01:30:16.200
<v Speaker 2>Motherfucker can't speak Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

2111
01:30:16.380 --> 01:30:18.050
<v Speaker 2>Like you should learn their language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2112
01:30:18.180 --> 01:30:20.610
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of like a guilty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like an American privilege.</v>

2113
01:30:20.611 --> 01:30:21.444
<v Speaker 2>I got,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to wait.</v>

2114
01:30:21.620 --> 01:30:23.700
<v Speaker 2>I was in Thailand for a year last year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2115
01:30:23.820 --> 01:30:25.710
<v Speaker 2>10 words in Thai.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2116
01:30:25.950 --> 01:30:27.420
<v Speaker 2>That's a shame on me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's like,</v>

2117
01:30:27.421 --> 01:30:30.300
<v Speaker 2>it's a commitment to learn something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that fundamentally different,</v>

2118
01:30:30.301 --> 01:30:30.690
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2119
01:30:30.690 --> 01:30:32.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thai especially,</v>

2120
01:30:32.330 --> 01:30:35.370
<v Speaker 2>it's like no offense to learn a whole</v>
<v Speaker 2>new alphabet.</v>

2121
01:30:36.030 --> 01:30:37.380
<v Speaker 2>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can't even read it.</v>

2122
01:30:37.381 --> 01:30:39.480
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like you gotta start way back to</v>

2123
01:30:39.481 --> 01:30:41.100
<v Speaker 2>kindergarten until,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2124
01:30:41.310 --> 01:30:43.860
<v Speaker 2>at least Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can kind of read letters.</v>

2125
01:30:43.861 --> 01:30:45.690
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>

2126
01:30:45.730 --> 01:30:48.390
<v Speaker 2>ties like that crazy language.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You look at it.</v>

2127
01:30:48.391 --> 01:30:49.660
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like,</v>

2128
01:30:49.890 --> 01:30:53.070
<v Speaker 2>like music,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like musical notes or something.</v>

2129
01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:54.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like,</v>

2130
01:30:55.860 --> 01:30:58.770
<v Speaker 2>other than being in Thailand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no advantage of knowing Thai.</v>

2131
01:30:59.030 --> 01:31:01.410
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't mean to bash on Thailand,</v>

2132
01:31:01.411 --> 01:31:03.350
<v Speaker 2>but it's like a Spanish as much more</v>
<v Speaker 2>than incentives.</v>

2133
01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:03.751
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

2134
01:31:03.751 --> 01:31:06.900
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people speak Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That would be a great thing to know.</v>

2135
01:31:07.140 --> 01:31:08.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense.</v>

2136
01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:11.880
<v Speaker 2>Spanish is probably next to English.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the most popular.</v>

2137
01:31:12.180 --> 01:31:14.130
<v Speaker 2>What is language?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say Mandarin.</v>

2138
01:31:14.131 --> 01:31:17.520
<v Speaker 2>Maybe that's like a billion people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I don't know.</v>

2139
01:31:17.521 --> 01:31:20.550
<v Speaker 2>The numbers in Spanish was huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That seems like a grind.</v>

2140
01:31:20.580 --> 01:31:21.840
<v Speaker 2>Learning Mandarin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2141
01:31:21.841 --> 01:31:24.330
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you have to learn symbols.</v>

2142
01:31:24.450 --> 01:31:24.991
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not even.</v>

2143
01:31:24.991 --> 01:31:26.450
<v Speaker 2>It's not even letters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2144
01:31:27.020 --> 01:31:29.670
<v Speaker 2>Fuck right there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Grammar structure,</v>

2145
01:31:29.730 --> 01:31:30.410
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2146
01:31:30.410 --> 01:31:33.600
<v Speaker 2>How do they text?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How to Chinese people text.</v>

2147
01:31:34.110 --> 01:31:35.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do they text?</v>

2148
01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:37.920
<v Speaker 2>How is it possible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A</v>

2149
01:31:39.690 --> 01:31:41.430
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a really good point.</v>

2150
01:31:41.730 --> 01:31:42.930
<v Speaker 2>Why should,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why should know this?</v>

2151
01:31:42.931 --> 01:31:46.470
<v Speaker 2>I should've already asked this question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do they have I asked this question?</v>

2152
01:31:46.471 --> 01:31:47.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know in Thai you can switch your</v>

2153
01:31:47.731 --> 01:31:50.220
<v Speaker 2>keyboard and Thailand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They switched their keyboard to.</v>

2154
01:31:50.610 --> 01:31:51.530
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2155
01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:55.920
<v Speaker 2>but they don't have the same numbers of</v>
<v Speaker 2>queues so I don't even.</v>

2156
01:31:56.430 --> 01:31:59.650
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But with Chinese characters and how the</v>

01:32:41.740 --> 01:32:44.710
<v Speaker 1>What about cell phone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Limited amount of keys.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And make,</v>

2176
01:32:59.500 --> 01:33:02.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm asking way too many questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to get the answers to</v>

2177
01:33:02.651 --> 01:33:06.130
<v Speaker 1>these either</v>
<v Speaker 1>at of all the places that you have</v>

2178
01:33:06.131 --> 01:33:06.990
<v Speaker 1>visited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2179
01:33:07.300 --> 01:33:08.770
<v Speaker 1>why did you choose Guatemala?</v>

2180
01:33:10.020 --> 01:33:12.010
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>close the United States.</v>

2181
01:33:12.100 --> 01:33:14.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm hiking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2182
01:33:14.590 --> 01:33:16.570
<v Speaker 2>like in a place called Lake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a teat lawn</v>

2183
01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:18.343
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2184
01:33:19.430 --> 01:33:21.440
<v Speaker 2>Go to lake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A state law in that place is gorgeous.</v>

2185
01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:25.910
<v Speaker 2>It's like this massive thousand depot</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand foot deep lake surrounded by</v>

2186
01:33:25.911 --> 01:33:28.160
<v Speaker 2>volcanoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like tiny little villages around</v>

2187
01:33:28.161 --> 01:33:29.930
<v Speaker 2>there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were just a little bit of googling</v>

2188
01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:30.800
<v Speaker 2>and it was kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

2189
01:33:31.190 --> 01:33:33.470
<v Speaker 2>why not let's go to Guatemala.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So did you go</v>

2190
01:33:33.820 --> 01:33:37.630
<v Speaker 1>as a visit and then decide to stay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or did you just go say let's see if we</v>

2191
01:33:37.631 --> 01:33:38.710
<v Speaker 1>can live here for a few months?</v>

2192
01:33:39.110 --> 01:33:39.943
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty much.</v>

2193
01:33:40.060 --> 01:33:42.230
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I liked the idea of like going three</v>

2194
01:33:42.231 --> 01:33:44.930
<v Speaker 2>months at a time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's enough to kind of like find a gym,</v>

2195
01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:47.090
<v Speaker 2>find your restaurant's settle into</v>
<v Speaker 2>apartment,</v>

2196
01:33:47.091 --> 01:33:49.880
<v Speaker 2>like doing every few weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just way too many logistics,</v>

2197
01:33:49.881 --> 01:33:50.750
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2198
01:33:51.220 --> 01:33:51.890
<v Speaker 2>so I think we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2199
01:33:51.890 --> 01:33:53.540
<v Speaker 2>we committed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was like three months down there.</v>

2200
01:33:53.780 --> 01:33:56.750
<v Speaker 2>I think we're going to commit to eastern</v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe for three months and then,</v>

2201
01:33:56.751 --> 01:33:58.010
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2202
01:33:58.011 --> 01:34:00.530
<v Speaker 2>coming back to Asia for three months</v>
<v Speaker 2>after the</v>

2203
01:34:01.170 --> 01:34:04.260
<v Speaker 1>whole expat lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it takes a very different kind of</v>

2204
01:34:04.261 --> 01:34:05.940
<v Speaker 1>person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2205
01:34:06.030 --> 01:34:08.430
<v Speaker 1>to just say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's try living in another country.</v>

2206
01:34:09.060 --> 01:34:11.250
<v Speaker 1>Like when you say fit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>find a gym,</v>

2207
01:34:11.251 --> 01:34:13.920
<v Speaker 1>like what kind of gyms they have in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>little village in Guatemala.</v>

2208
01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:18.160
<v Speaker 1>They did literally</v>

2209
01:34:18.260 --> 01:34:21.650
<v Speaker 2>you mentioned that they had um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>paint buckets with cement and I'm for</v>

2210
01:34:21.651 --> 01:34:24.830
<v Speaker 2>real with pvcs and like I wouldn't work</v>
<v Speaker 2>out there.</v>

2211
01:34:24.831 --> 01:34:27.470
<v Speaker 2>That was like a teat line,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Antigua's it really did.</v>

2212
01:34:28.200 --> 01:34:31.810
<v Speaker 1>It's like super ghetto stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they had paint buckets filled with</v>

2213
01:34:31.811 --> 01:34:33.880
<v Speaker 1>cement that are attached to sticks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2214
01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:35.830
<v Speaker 1>Literally that's how you worked out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2215
01:34:36.130 --> 01:34:37.480
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2216
01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:39.150
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2217
01:34:39.150 --> 01:34:40.710
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in tig was different.</v>

2218
01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:42.570
<v Speaker 2>That's like a more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a bigger town city,</v>

2219
01:34:42.571 --> 01:34:45.840
<v Speaker 2>like they have a proper gym.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We go to yoga classes all the whole,</v>

2220
01:34:45.870 --> 01:34:46.890
<v Speaker 2>the whole nine yards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>

2221
01:34:46.891 --> 01:34:48.600
<v Speaker 2>So it's almost like America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's totally.</v>

2222
01:34:49.170 --> 01:34:52.530
<v Speaker 2>So when you're using these paint buckets</v>
<v Speaker 2>with me,</v>

2223
01:34:52.750 --> 01:34:55.730
<v Speaker 2>didn't use him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was only at Laika teat line.</v>

2224
01:34:55.740 --> 01:34:58.480
<v Speaker 2>So I'm an Antiguan Elica teat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was only there for a month and lake</v>

2225
01:34:58.481 --> 01:35:02.240
<v Speaker 2>teat Atlanta is like a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe like seven small villages</v>

2226
01:35:02.241 --> 01:35:05.510
<v Speaker 2>scattered around the lake and um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're actually indigenous.</v>

2227
01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:08.760
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're directly Mayan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

2228
01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:12.020
<v Speaker 2>Those people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Guatemala interesting is of all the</v>

2229
01:35:12.021 --> 01:35:14.390
<v Speaker 2>South American Central American</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries as the highest percentage of</v>

2230
01:35:14.391 --> 01:35:17.720
<v Speaker 2>indigenous people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like 30 percent indigenous so</v>

2231
01:35:17.721 --> 01:35:19.880
<v Speaker 2>they don't even speak Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

2232
01:35:19.910 --> 01:35:21.040
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they like,</v>

2233
01:35:21.050 --> 01:35:23.920
<v Speaker 2>what do they speak?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's catch a cold kitchen.</v>

2234
01:35:24.250 --> 01:35:27.120
<v Speaker 2>So is it a Mayan dialect?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe so.</v>

2235
01:35:27.740 --> 01:35:32.710
<v Speaker 2>They're totally different people and</v>
<v Speaker 2>they dress traditional everything</v>

2236
01:35:32.730 --> 01:35:34.380
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's intense.</v>

2237
01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:37.140
<v Speaker 1>Well they have a very strong will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least mine's did.</v>

2238
01:35:37.141 --> 01:35:39.660
<v Speaker 1>They had a very strange language where</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2239
01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:41.880
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

2240
01:35:42.130 --> 01:35:45.630
<v Speaker 1>there you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The letters or the images represent</v>

2241
01:35:45.631 --> 01:35:49.530
<v Speaker 1>sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so the sounds like,</v>

2242
01:35:49.890 --> 01:35:52.620
<v Speaker 1>like you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like you would have like an eye.</v>

2243
01:35:52.950 --> 01:35:55.200
<v Speaker 1>Like this is how a Terence Mckenna</v>
<v Speaker 1>described it.</v>

2244
01:35:55.201 --> 01:36:00.201
<v Speaker 1>You'd have like an eyeball a saw an aunt</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a bug and then arose.</v>

2245
01:36:01.350 --> 01:36:03.660
<v Speaker 1>And that would be the way you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw aunt rose.</v>

2246
01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:06.360
<v Speaker 1>How do you know this was just from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terence Mckenna?</v>

2247
01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:08.390
<v Speaker 1>Him talking about it because he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

2248
01:36:08.391 --> 01:36:08.941
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was,</v>

2249
01:36:08.941 --> 01:36:11.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a crazy psychedelic.</v>

2250
01:36:11.921 --> 01:36:14.230
<v Speaker 1>Did venture character,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know Mckenna is?</v>

2251
01:36:15.030 --> 01:36:16.170
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I should,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2252
01:36:16.171 --> 01:36:21.171
<v Speaker 1>He's a fascinating speaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a who was a psychedelic lecture.</v>

2253
01:36:21.271 --> 01:36:25.680
<v Speaker 1>He was a botanist and just did way too</v>
<v Speaker 1>many drugs and,</v>

2254
01:36:25.740 --> 01:36:27.720
<v Speaker 1>or the right amount depending on who you</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask.</v>

2255
01:36:28.050 --> 01:36:31.020
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he got really deep into the mind culture</v>

2256
01:36:31.021 --> 01:36:33.210
<v Speaker 1>and he was one of those guys that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking that December 20,</v>

2257
01:36:33.211 --> 01:36:35.760
<v Speaker 1>first 2012 is going to be some crazy</v>
<v Speaker 1>event,</v>

2258
01:36:36.620 --> 01:36:40.950
<v Speaker 1>was not necessarily more of a shifting</v>
<v Speaker 1>of consciousness because it was a,</v>

2259
01:36:40.980 --> 01:36:43.260
<v Speaker 1>the end of the long count of the Mayan</v>
<v Speaker 1>calendar.</v>

2260
01:36:44.910 --> 01:36:45.661
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2261
01:36:45.661 --> 01:36:47.640
<v Speaker 1>well the Mayan calendar is a really</v>
<v Speaker 1>tricky thing,</v>

2262
01:36:47.641 --> 01:36:52.170
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the sort of various different</v>

2263
01:36:53.310 --> 01:36:57.450
<v Speaker 1>decipher rings of it and the people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are attached to all these different</v>

2264
01:36:57.690 --> 01:37:00.920
<v Speaker 1>meanings to it that don't necessarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>jive with the original meetings.</v>

2265
01:37:01.270 --> 01:37:03.540
<v Speaker 1>It was very hard to tell what the Mayans</v>
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>

2266
01:37:03.541 --> 01:37:05.910
<v Speaker 1>because they're not around anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

2267
01:37:05.911 --> 01:37:09.240
<v Speaker 1>So it's not like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're studying ancient Russia where</v>

2268
01:37:09.241 --> 01:37:10.980
<v Speaker 1>people are rushing scholars and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

2269
01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:13.080
<v Speaker 1>There's a direct lineage between them</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the people.</v>

2270
01:37:13.081 --> 01:37:15.450
<v Speaker 1>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you said culture,</v>

2271
01:37:15.870 --> 01:37:18.020
<v Speaker 1>the language has gone and how we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>gonna fix.</v>

2272
01:37:18.450 --> 01:37:19.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they was.</v>

2273
01:37:19.020 --> 01:37:24.020
<v Speaker 1>There's like some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some translations it took forever to</v>

2274
01:37:24.451 --> 01:37:28.770
<v Speaker 1>figure out and there's things that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>similar in some ways to a Rosetta stone</v>

2275
01:37:28.771 --> 01:37:31.530
<v Speaker 1>where they're trying to match up what it</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to be,</v>

2276
01:37:31.650 --> 01:37:36.650
<v Speaker 1>what it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we try to figure out how you would</v>

2277
01:37:36.930 --> 01:37:41.930
<v Speaker 1>say these words in the context of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture that existed 2000 years ago as</v>

2278
01:37:42.961 --> 01:37:44.370
<v Speaker 1>opposed to today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how would you,</v>

2279
01:37:44.371 --> 01:37:47.340
<v Speaker 1>Eva,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about the way they viewed</v>

2280
01:37:47.341 --> 01:37:49.470
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way they communicated was incredibly</v>

2281
01:37:49.471 --> 01:37:51.120
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's has an interesting.</v>

2282
01:37:51.121 --> 01:37:52.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fascinating stuff.</v>

2283
01:37:52.951 --> 01:37:55.920
<v Speaker 1>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a great documentary decoding</v>

2284
01:37:55.921 --> 01:37:57.760
<v Speaker 1>the Maya.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was A.</v>

2285
01:37:57.810 --> 01:37:59.780
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a nat geo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like that guy.</v>

2286
01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:00.910
<v Speaker 1>Fuck I'm going to send you that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2287
01:38:00.920 --> 01:38:04.950
<v Speaker 1>I think it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it just detailed how difficult it</v>

2288
01:38:04.951 --> 01:38:08.610
<v Speaker 1>was for these people to try to figure</v>
<v Speaker 1>out who these symbols and say,</v>

2289
01:38:08.611 --> 01:38:09.840
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do these mean?</v>

2290
01:38:09.910 --> 01:38:13.050
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck do they mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And apparently there was a really recent</v>

2291
01:38:13.060 --> 01:38:16.530
<v Speaker 1>breakthrough where they found a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 1>of,</v>

2292
01:38:17.170 --> 01:38:19.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they called them</v>
<v Speaker 1>hieroglyphs,</v>

2293
01:38:19.590 --> 01:38:21.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what they actually call</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

2294
01:38:21.730 --> 01:38:23.140
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they,</v>

2295
01:38:23.150 --> 01:38:28.150
<v Speaker 1>they found a bunch of previously</v>
<v Speaker 1>undiscovered Mayan language that sort of</v>

2296
01:38:29.041 --> 01:38:33.780
<v Speaker 1>filled in some pieces that they hadn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hadn't filled in before.</v>

2297
01:38:34.020 --> 01:38:38.160
<v Speaker 1>Then you look at some of the amazing</v>
<v Speaker 1>murals that looked like a guy seated in</v>

2298
01:38:38.161 --> 01:38:42.360
<v Speaker 1>a spaceship with fire below his seat and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you try to figure out what the fuck this</v>

2299
01:38:42.361 --> 01:38:46.140
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like a lot of those ancient alien alien</v>

2300
01:38:46.141 --> 01:38:46.920
<v Speaker 1>theorists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2301
01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:47.731
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ever seen that one?</v>

2302
01:38:47.731 --> 01:38:51.750
<v Speaker 1>There's one is a really crazy as it</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like a guy who's leaning back in</v>

2303
01:38:51.751 --> 01:38:53.970
<v Speaker 1>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a spaceship.</v>

2304
01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:57.840
<v Speaker 1>It looks like he's leaning back in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cockpit chair and he's looking through</v>

2305
01:38:57.841 --> 01:39:01.380
<v Speaker 1>something that looks like a telescope</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's moving some,</v>

2306
01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:05.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some levers with his hands and it looks</v>

2307
01:39:05.221 --> 01:39:09.000
<v Speaker 1>like there's fire beneath him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really bizarre,</v>

2308
01:39:09.001 --> 01:39:12.830
<v Speaker 1>fascinating stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that was drawn a long time ago.</v>

2309
01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:14.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there it is right there.</v>

2310
01:39:14.100 --> 01:39:15.150
<v Speaker 1>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the.</v>

2311
01:39:17.220 --> 01:39:21.810
<v Speaker 1>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess there's a go full screen with</v>

2312
01:39:21.811 --> 01:39:23.160
<v Speaker 1>that one right there that you got right</v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

2313
01:39:23.940 --> 01:39:24.481
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2314
01:39:24.481 --> 01:39:29.481
<v Speaker 1>so below him as fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sitted he's moving some stuff with</v>

2315
01:39:29.521 --> 01:39:32.640
<v Speaker 1>his feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's moving some levers and you see how</v>

2316
01:39:32.641 --> 01:39:36.060
<v Speaker 1>he's looking through that thing and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks like it's got like a gas mask on</v>

2317
01:39:36.300 --> 01:39:41.300
<v Speaker 1>like an oxygen mask and all those people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that like the von Danek and guys like</v>

2318
01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:47.240
<v Speaker 1>they believed that what this showed was</v>
<v Speaker 1>a man sitting in a cockpit using the</v>

2319
01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.970
<v Speaker 1>levers and machines to operate some sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a spaceship.</v>

2320
01:39:54.270 --> 01:39:57.720
<v Speaker 1>So wherever that spaceship from most</v>
<v Speaker 1>likely it didn't exist.</v>

2321
01:39:57.721 --> 01:40:01.120
<v Speaker 1>Most likely these guy was for highest</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck on the mushrooms and they're</v>

2322
01:40:01.140 --> 01:40:04.440
<v Speaker 1>probably imagining the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if I had to guess,</v>

2323
01:40:04.470 --> 01:40:09.470
<v Speaker 1>I would say that these ideas were</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably very psychedelically based</v>

2324
01:40:10.350 --> 01:40:12.240
<v Speaker 1>because they were really into</v>
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic drugs.</v>

2325
01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:15.390
<v Speaker 1>They had found a lot of different drugs</v>
<v Speaker 1>and a lot of different vines that</v>

2326
01:40:15.391 --> 01:40:18.030
<v Speaker 1>contained lysergic acid and it's one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

2327
01:40:18.031 --> 01:40:21.750
<v Speaker 1>I had a did a trip to Chichen Itza,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is really cool,</v>

2328
01:40:21.780 --> 01:40:26.280
<v Speaker 1>bunch of years back and I had a</v>
<v Speaker 1>professor that was the guide.</v>

2329
01:40:26.310 --> 01:40:29.730
<v Speaker 1>It was really cool because you could</v>
<v Speaker 1>hire people for a guy.</v>

2330
01:40:29.731 --> 01:40:34.731
<v Speaker 1>Then we got this guy who was a professor</v>
<v Speaker 1>in mine history and he when he knew that</v>

2331
01:40:36.271 --> 01:40:38.220
<v Speaker 1>I was really into it and I asked all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these questions,</v>

2332
01:40:38.221 --> 01:40:41.560
<v Speaker 1>he was super psyched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so he went way deep into it and we had</v>

2333
01:40:41.561 --> 01:40:44.550
<v Speaker 1>it for like six hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He took us on this grand tour,</v>

2334
01:40:44.551 --> 01:40:49.551
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things he showed us this</v>
<v Speaker 1>area of one of the pyramids were they</v>

2335
01:40:49.771 --> 01:40:53.010
<v Speaker 1>used to do these psychedelic rituals and</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was talking about these.</v>

2336
01:40:53.570 --> 01:40:57.010
<v Speaker 1>They used to take these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these vines that had some sort of</v>

2337
01:40:57.011 --> 01:41:01.960
<v Speaker 1>lysergic acid in it and they would have</v>
<v Speaker 1>these psychedelic rituals and one of</v>

2338
01:41:01.961 --> 01:41:04.090
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things they used to do when</v>

2339
01:41:04.091 --> 01:41:06.430
<v Speaker 1>they were studying the stars and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

2340
01:41:06.431 --> 01:41:07.870
<v Speaker 1>looking at it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously no,</v>

2341
01:41:07.900 --> 01:41:09.340
<v Speaker 1>no light pollution back then.</v>

2342
01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:11.320
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these guys are tripping their balls</v>

2343
01:41:11.321 --> 01:41:15.370
<v Speaker 1>out on acid staring at this beautiful</v>
<v Speaker 1>star scape.</v>

2344
01:41:15.940 --> 01:41:19.870
<v Speaker 1>And what's the DNA of the violence still</v>
<v Speaker 1>around home and I remember because it</v>

2345
01:41:19.871 --> 01:41:22.300
<v Speaker 1>was so long ago that I went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went and like</v>

2346
01:41:23.800 --> 01:41:26.650
<v Speaker 1>early two thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2002 or something like that.</v>

2347
01:41:26.651 --> 01:41:29.200
<v Speaker 1>I think we went,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was amazing.</v>

2348
01:41:29.620 --> 01:41:34.620
<v Speaker 1>They just think that you're standing on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground where these people existed</v>

2349
01:41:35.110 --> 01:41:39.160
<v Speaker 1>and they had this bizarre culture that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't understand that was aligned to</v>

2350
01:41:39.161 --> 01:41:42.880
<v Speaker 1>the cosmos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like the other structures were based on</v>

2351
01:41:42.881 --> 01:41:44.420
<v Speaker 1>constellations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>

2352
01:41:44.510 --> 01:41:49.510
<v Speaker 1>the maps of these structures mirrored</v>
<v Speaker 1>constellations and they were really into</v>

2353
01:41:49.571 --> 01:41:53.320
<v Speaker 1>a astronomy and some sort of a weird</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

2354
01:41:54.250 --> 01:41:55.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

2355
01:41:55.361 --> 01:41:57.280
<v Speaker 1>right over your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how the fuck did they,</v>

2356
01:41:57.610 --> 01:41:59.110
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they apparently there's evidence that</v>

2357
01:41:59.111 --> 01:42:04.111
<v Speaker 1>they knew about the procession of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>equinoxes which is a 20 something</v>

2358
01:42:04.331 --> 01:42:07.930
<v Speaker 1>thousand year cycle of wobble of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>earth.</v>

2359
01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:10.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they see that the earth isn't</v>

2360
01:42:10.991 --> 01:42:11.980
<v Speaker 1>just spin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2361
01:42:12.130 --> 01:42:15.340
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't just spin perfectly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It spins with like a little bit of a</v>

2362
01:42:15.341 --> 01:42:18.910
<v Speaker 1>wobble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the night sky changes and it goes</v>

2363
01:42:18.911 --> 01:42:22.180
<v Speaker 1>into this 26,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's 26,000 year cycle.</v>

2364
01:42:22.600 --> 01:42:25.330
<v Speaker 1>And they apparently knew about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

2365
01:42:25.380 --> 01:42:26.750
<v Speaker 1>how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how?</v>

2366
01:42:26.980 --> 01:42:28.960
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2367
01:42:28.961 --> 01:42:33.730
<v Speaker 1>I guess if you have a lot of time back</v>
<v Speaker 1>then and there's no iphone constantly</v>

2368
01:42:33.731 --> 01:42:37.420
<v Speaker 1>distract you with checking your twitter</v>
<v Speaker 1>picture on Instagram,</v>

2369
01:42:37.650 --> 01:42:39.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're instead you just looking at</v>

2370
01:42:39.281 --> 01:42:41.110
<v Speaker 1>constellations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't know how they would,</v>

2371
01:42:41.770 --> 01:42:43.840
<v Speaker 1>how they would market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how they,</v>

2372
01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:44.790
<v Speaker 1>how will they would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2373
01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:49.210
<v Speaker 1>I guess that they would see that there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>some sort of subtle changing of the</v>

2374
01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:54.240
<v Speaker 1>night sky in terms of like how it would</v>
<v Speaker 1>move a little bit all the time.</v>

2375
01:42:55.840 --> 01:42:59.320
<v Speaker 1>Not just move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously the night sky moves with the</v>

2376
01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:01.830
<v Speaker 1>seasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at a different image as</v>

2377
01:43:02.170 --> 01:43:07.170
<v Speaker 1>the sun moves and this planet spins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's just the,</v>

2378
01:43:08.111 --> 01:43:10.780
<v Speaker 1>the idea that these people had figured</v>
<v Speaker 1>out all these different things.</v>

2379
01:43:10.780 --> 01:43:14.800
<v Speaker 1>Like in terms of like mapping</v>
<v Speaker 1>constellations so long ago.</v>

2380
01:43:14.860 --> 01:43:16.600
<v Speaker 1>Wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2381
01:43:16.730 --> 01:43:18.100
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

2382
01:43:18.520 --> 01:43:21.880
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucked up that we don't know what</v>

2383
01:43:21.881 --> 01:43:23.620
<v Speaker 1>they were saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2384
01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:27.820
<v Speaker 1>like we've never heard their language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's one of the things about one of</v>

2385
01:43:27.821 --> 01:43:28.231
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2386
01:43:28.231 --> 01:43:32.860
<v Speaker 1>other documentaries that I watched was</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they were trying to mimic what the</v>

2387
01:43:32.861 --> 01:43:36.280
<v Speaker 1>sound of these Mayan languages could</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been like.</v>

2388
01:43:36.790 --> 01:43:38.770
<v Speaker 1>And they really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of guesswork,</v>

2389
01:43:39.160 --> 01:43:42.520
<v Speaker 1>but they didn't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can see if there's something that</v>

2390
01:43:42.521 --> 01:43:45.070
<v Speaker 1>you find or something where they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2391
01:43:45.910 --> 01:43:49.840
<v Speaker 1>hear what the Mayan language could have</v>
<v Speaker 1>sounded like.</v>

2392
01:43:50.700 --> 01:43:54.310
<v Speaker 1>There was some sort of a really bizarre</v>
<v Speaker 1>like clicks or something I them,</v>

2393
01:43:54.380 --> 01:43:57.200
<v Speaker 1>which is weird language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't even know if that's right</v>

2394
01:43:57.410 --> 01:44:00.050
<v Speaker 1>because there's no one around total</v>
<v Speaker 1>guests.</v>

2395
01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:03.980
<v Speaker 1>They just died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just went away,</v>

2396
01:44:04.010 --> 01:44:04.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2397
01:44:04.610 --> 01:44:07.100
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the language got absorbed and</v>

2398
01:44:07.460 --> 01:44:09.920
<v Speaker 1>obviously these people that you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about probably have some sort of</v>

2399
01:44:09.921 --> 01:44:10.820
<v Speaker 1>a dialect and.</v>

2400
01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:12.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I have no idea what the correlation</v>

2401
01:44:12.951 --> 01:44:16.340
<v Speaker 1>was between the current descendants in</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you're talking about.</v>

2402
01:44:16.341 --> 01:44:17.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2403
01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:20.600
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's really bizarre is it's not that</v>

2404
01:44:20.601 --> 01:44:24.740
<v Speaker 1>long ago in terms of human history</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you look back and like human</v>

2405
01:44:24.741 --> 01:44:28.160
<v Speaker 1>history in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like there's places in Europe you can</v>

2406
01:44:28.161 --> 01:44:30.700
<v Speaker 1>visit that are 2000 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2407
01:44:31.580 --> 01:44:36.580
<v Speaker 1>isn't there a fucking bar somewhere in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe that's like almost 900 years old</v>

2408
01:44:36.651 --> 01:44:38.210
<v Speaker 1>or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something crazy like that.</v>

2409
01:44:38.630 --> 01:44:41.510
<v Speaker 1>So these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that the Mayan civilization</v>

2410
01:44:41.511 --> 01:44:46.340
<v Speaker 1>they think was not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not more than 2000 years ago.</v>

2411
01:44:46.970 --> 01:44:49.040
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sean's bars,</v>

2412
01:44:49.070 --> 01:44:52.670
<v Speaker 1>a pub in athlone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ireland is the oldest pub in Ireland.</v>

2413
01:44:52.700 --> 01:44:56.570
<v Speaker 1>Goes back to 900.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eight d older than 100 years old.</v>

2414
01:44:56.600 --> 01:45:01.600
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand 900 years old essentially.</v>

2415
01:45:03.290 --> 01:45:04.220
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>980.</v>

2416
01:45:05.110 --> 01:45:07.670
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But think about that.</v>

2417
01:45:07.700 --> 01:45:10.570
<v Speaker 1>That's a thousand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2418
01:45:10.690 --> 01:45:11.930
<v Speaker 1>it says oldest pub in Europe.</v>

2419
01:45:11.930 --> 01:45:14.660
<v Speaker 1>So what's the oldest?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The oldest pub in the world?</v>

2420
01:45:14.900 --> 01:45:18.440
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But just think of that 900.</v>

2421
01:45:18.441 --> 01:45:20.210
<v Speaker 1>Add that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

2422
01:45:20.450 --> 01:45:25.450
<v Speaker 1>that's three or 400 years before gingiss</v>
<v Speaker 1>con you old trip to Jerusalem.</v>

2423
01:45:26.420 --> 01:45:27.350
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1000.</v>

2424
01:45:27.351 --> 01:45:28.180
<v Speaker 1>One hundred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>$8.</v>

2425
01:45:28.180 --> 01:45:31.940
<v Speaker 1>80 nine 8,980.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that seems like the oldest.</v>

2426
01:45:31.941 --> 01:45:34.160
<v Speaker 1>Yeah it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the 900 a day.</v>

2427
01:45:34.190 --> 01:45:37.310
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More than 1100 years ago.</v>

2428
01:45:37.550 --> 01:45:42.220
<v Speaker 1>Fucking a man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just crazy that much older than America.</v>

2429
01:45:42.230 --> 01:45:44.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So book one was the Mayan civilization</v>

2430
01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:46.930
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when was the,</v>

2431
01:45:46.940 --> 01:45:49.490
<v Speaker 1>was the decline of the Mayan</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilization.</v>

2432
01:45:49.491 --> 01:45:53.980
<v Speaker 1>See if you find that</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is pretty amazing when you stop and</v>

2433
01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:57.860
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about just the bizarre history of</v>

2434
01:45:58.290 --> 01:46:02.720
<v Speaker 1>the human race and that there are these</v>
<v Speaker 1>civilizations that have these.</v>

2435
01:46:03.110 --> 01:46:07.430
<v Speaker 1>They lived and he sort of isolated</v>
<v Speaker 1>environments where they developed in</v>

2436
01:46:07.431 --> 01:46:12.431
<v Speaker 1>many ways parallel sort of building</v>
<v Speaker 1>techniques but different than other</v>

2437
01:46:12.771 --> 01:46:15.680
<v Speaker 1>parts of the world that were also based</v>
<v Speaker 1>on constellations.</v>

2438
01:46:15.680 --> 01:46:20.220
<v Speaker 1>Like very similar to a lot of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hypothesis about Egyptian culture is</v>

2439
01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:23.600
<v Speaker 1>that they had done that collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It goes,</v>

2440
01:46:24.590 --> 01:46:25.800
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>980.</v>

2441
01:46:25.940 --> 01:46:27.940
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So right,</v>

2442
01:46:27.960 --> 01:46:30.680
<v Speaker 1>right on the light.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When that bar was built,</v>

2443
01:46:30.710 --> 01:46:33.470
<v Speaker 1>maybe the bar fucking caused it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all went to Ireland.</v>

2444
01:46:33.471 --> 01:46:35.780
<v Speaker 1>Got Hammered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That wow,</v>

2445
01:46:35.781 --> 01:46:38.120
<v Speaker 1>that's a coincidence that entered a 80</v>
<v Speaker 1>right there.</v>

2446
01:46:38.450 --> 01:46:42.080
<v Speaker 1>Nine hundred 80 up and down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what a bizarre and complex</v>

2447
01:46:42.200 --> 01:46:45.740
<v Speaker 1>civilization the Mayans were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if you could find out this is what</v>

2448
01:46:45.741 --> 01:46:49.010
<v Speaker 1>the Mayan language sounded like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found a,</v>

2449
01:46:49.290 --> 01:46:51.420
<v Speaker 1>but it's psycho.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A woman living currently.</v>

2450
01:46:51.421 --> 01:46:52.920
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what it could have sounded like.</v>

2451
01:46:52.921 --> 01:46:55.700
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

2452
01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:58.530
<v Speaker 1>Let's hear what she says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me see what it may be me.</v>

2453
01:46:58.550 --> 01:47:00.520
<v Speaker 1>Maybe there's some of it left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2454
01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:02.750
<v Speaker 1>you could take on anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if that's the same.</v>

2455
01:47:02.780 --> 01:47:03.613
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could.</v>

2456
01:47:03.900 --> 01:47:05.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll say you could open it.</v>

2457
01:47:05.130 --> 01:47:07.900
<v Speaker 1>That's where the city near Guatemala.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

2458
01:47:20.470 --> 01:47:25.470
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe</v>

2459
01:47:45.390 --> 01:47:48.600
<v Speaker 3>doesn't sound like anything that I've</v>
<v Speaker 3>ever heard before.</v>

2460
01:47:49.870 --> 01:47:52.170
<v Speaker 1>Spanish words drugged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says what you could.</v>

2461
01:47:52.430 --> 01:47:54.820
<v Speaker 1>Maya sounds really sounds like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

2462
01:47:54.830 --> 01:47:59.170
<v Speaker 1>What's the description?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this guy had his housekeeper describe</v>

2463
01:47:59.171 --> 01:48:00.620
<v Speaker 1>what this older woman was saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2464
01:48:00.930 --> 01:48:03.820
<v Speaker 1>go back to look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It says attention Mel Gibson.</v>

2465
01:48:05.660 --> 01:48:07.570
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She saw that movie apocalypto and had a</v>

2466
01:48:07.571 --> 01:48:10.330
<v Speaker 1>hard time understanding the mind that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were speaking in that movie.</v>

2467
01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:13.390
<v Speaker 1>If you listen closely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can hear a few Spanish words mixed</v>

2468
01:48:13.391 --> 01:48:15.280
<v Speaker 1>in where there are no mind words,</v>

2469
01:48:16.270 --> 01:48:18.160
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2470
01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:20.590
<v Speaker 4>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Apocalypto.</v>

2471
01:48:20.700 --> 01:48:23.220
<v Speaker 1>That's really interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe he claimed that they were speaking</v>

2472
01:48:23.221 --> 01:48:25.200
<v Speaker 1>at or something like that or what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That movie,</v>

2473
01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:28.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get done in apocalypto</v>
<v Speaker 1>mean you're talking about a dead</v>

2474
01:48:28.711 --> 01:48:31.090
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could you get a guest to.</v>

2475
01:48:31.400 --> 01:48:35.100
<v Speaker 1>What did he do with apocalypto?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he use Spanish?</v>

2476
01:48:35.760 --> 01:48:39.000
<v Speaker 1>Did he mix it in with stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine that we'd hire some sort</v>

2477
01:48:39.001 --> 01:48:39.900
<v Speaker 1>of language experts,</v>

2478
01:48:41.310 --> 01:48:42.040
<v Speaker 4>but</v>

2479
01:48:42.040 --> 01:48:43.840
<v Speaker 1>what else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might might've been busy getting</v>

2480
01:48:43.841 --> 01:48:48.170
<v Speaker 1>drunk and yelling at choose</v>
<v Speaker 1>curse curse.</v>

2481
01:48:48.190 --> 01:48:52.630
<v Speaker 1>Now his ex wife</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that I pulled up off of mental</v>

2482
01:48:52.631 --> 01:48:53.820
<v Speaker 1>floss is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2483
01:48:54.220 --> 01:48:57.640
<v Speaker 1>if like 15 fun facts about the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says that he was a stickler for</v>

2484
01:48:57.641 --> 01:49:00.650
<v Speaker 1>authentic language and all of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>dialogue is you could take Maya</v>

2485
01:49:00.670 --> 01:49:01.503
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

2486
01:49:01.510 --> 01:49:02.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well huh.</v>

2487
01:49:02.620 --> 01:49:06.430
<v Speaker 1>That's where the discrepancy is in that</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe he said he used it all and she's</v>

2488
01:49:06.431 --> 01:49:11.050
<v Speaker 1>saying I speak it not unrecognized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What she's not saying that she spoke it.</v>

2489
01:49:11.051 --> 01:49:14.710
<v Speaker 1>If you read what she said she was saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she had given this woman a massage</v>

2490
01:49:15.130 --> 01:49:19.030
<v Speaker 1>and the woman was speaking to her and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that she recognized a few words in</v>

2491
01:49:19.031 --> 01:49:20.440
<v Speaker 1>Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but she didn't.</v>

2492
01:49:20.530 --> 01:49:23.260
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's a bridge between</v>

2493
01:49:23.261 --> 01:49:25.030
<v Speaker 1>that lag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think there's anybody who knows</v>

2494
01:49:25.031 --> 01:49:28.720
<v Speaker 1>that language and also speaks English</v>
<v Speaker 1>that can crazy man.</v>

2495
01:49:29.830 --> 01:49:34.630
<v Speaker 1>That whole part of the world is so then</v>
<v Speaker 1>you go back to like the in the old macs,</v>

2496
01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:36.130
<v Speaker 1>they don't even know who those people</v>
<v Speaker 1>were.</v>

2497
01:49:36.580 --> 01:49:39.520
<v Speaker 1>Those strange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost African looking phases.</v>

2498
01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:42.280
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those gigantic stone structures that</v>

2499
01:49:42.290 --> 01:49:44.470
<v Speaker 1>they found that there could be thousands</v>
<v Speaker 1>of years old.</v>

2500
01:49:44.610 --> 01:49:46.990
<v Speaker 1>Are you talking about off of the coast</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Ecuador?</v>

2501
01:49:47.350 --> 01:49:50.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The old Mac are there almost like a</v>

2502
01:49:51.220 --> 01:49:53.380
<v Speaker 1>hypothetical situation or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a,</v>

2503
01:49:53.381 --> 01:49:54.700
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't.</v>

2504
01:49:55.630 --> 01:49:58.210
<v Speaker 1>They don't necessarily know where these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people came from.</v>

2505
01:49:58.510 --> 01:50:02.390
<v Speaker 1>They don't know who they were and some</v>
<v Speaker 1>people have said they look a lot like,</v>

2506
01:50:02.530 --> 01:50:04.820
<v Speaker 1>like really strong featured,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2507
01:50:04.990 --> 01:50:08.680
<v Speaker 1>South American folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some people have actually compared</v>

2508
01:50:08.681 --> 01:50:11.270
<v Speaker 1>the way the old mex were depicted in</v>
<v Speaker 1>these structures,</v>

2509
01:50:11.300 --> 01:50:15.130
<v Speaker 1>these statues and things that they look</v>
<v Speaker 1>more like Africans,</v>

2510
01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:17.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this has been like speculation that</v>

2511
01:50:17.890 --> 01:50:21.040
<v Speaker 1>these are people that might have come</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Africa on boats.</v>

2512
01:50:21.180 --> 01:50:25.180
<v Speaker 1>That's been widely criticized too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the point is they don't really know</v>

2513
01:50:25.181 --> 01:50:28.990
<v Speaker 1>much about the old Mex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever seen images from the seat pull</v>

2514
01:50:28.991 --> 01:50:33.991
<v Speaker 1>up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm old MAC statues o l m e C,</v>

2515
01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:36.580
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's the way they spell it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>

2516
01:50:36.581 --> 01:50:37.900
<v Speaker 1>that's just phonetic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't,</v>

2517
01:50:38.110 --> 01:50:40.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know what language these</v>
<v Speaker 1>people spoke and these are.</v>

2518
01:50:40.850 --> 01:50:45.100
<v Speaker 1>So these are some statues and things</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they found in South America.</v>

2519
01:50:45.580 --> 01:50:48.220
<v Speaker 1>Look at these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

2520
01:50:48.290 --> 01:50:49.150
<v Speaker 1>Seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's so.</v>

2521
01:50:49.151 --> 01:50:50.950
<v Speaker 1>They have different legends of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hidden Temple.</v>

2522
01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:53.080
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see that show?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a joke.</v>

2523
01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:56.110
<v Speaker 1>I said that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought that was going to pull up the</v>

2524
01:50:56.110 --> 01:50:57.510
<v Speaker 1>Nickelodeon TV show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

2525
01:50:57.610 --> 01:50:58.770
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm thinking of no.</v>

2526
01:50:58.780 --> 01:51:00.010
<v Speaker 1>The omex like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at that one.</v>

2527
01:51:00.011 --> 01:51:02.320
<v Speaker 1>The third one over from the top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

2528
01:51:02.560 --> 01:51:04.840
<v Speaker 1>I mean that looks very African,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>

2529
01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:08.580
<v Speaker 1>We really thick lips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wide noses,</v>

2530
01:51:08.581 --> 01:51:10.430
<v Speaker 1>large nostrils.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really interesting.</v>

2531
01:51:11.100 --> 01:51:15.690
<v Speaker 1>Mean these people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't exactly know what their</v>

2532
01:51:15.691 --> 01:51:19.010
<v Speaker 1>culture was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't exactly know who they were.</v>

2533
01:51:19.100 --> 01:51:24.000
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to carbon date as well because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dealing with stone so until they</v>

2534
01:51:24.001 --> 01:51:25.980
<v Speaker 1>find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2535
01:51:26.070 --> 01:51:28.560
<v Speaker 1>things that are around there that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can back date.</v>

2536
01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:31.770
<v Speaker 1>I think that the estimate is 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

2537
01:51:33.600 --> 01:51:34.560
<v Speaker 1>I might've made that up though.</v>

2538
01:51:35.710 --> 01:51:37.120
<v Speaker 1>See?</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if you could find out.</v>

2539
01:51:37.121 --> 01:51:40.660
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How long ago were the old Mex?</v>

2540
01:51:40.960 --> 01:51:42.780
<v Speaker 1>The.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could see it back where you just</v>

2541
01:51:42.790 --> 01:51:43.690
<v Speaker 1>were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does it say?</v>

2542
01:51:43.691 --> 01:51:45.580
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be saved?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus.</v>

2543
01:51:45.581 --> 01:51:48.220
<v Speaker 1>Everything is done at RBC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was 80 they before.</v>

2544
01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:51.730
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why am I screwing that up?</v>

2545
01:51:52.930 --> 01:51:55.450
<v Speaker 1>Dealing with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in pain right now dealing with this.</v>

2546
01:51:55.660 --> 01:51:58.150
<v Speaker 1>How's it doing better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But fuck man,</v>

2547
01:51:58.210 --> 01:52:02.140
<v Speaker 1>I was in Mexico this week and I got</v>
<v Speaker 1>severely sunburn on my back.</v>

2548
01:52:02.530 --> 01:52:05.110
<v Speaker 1>Put sunscreen everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But my back,</v>

2549
01:52:05.150 --> 01:52:10.150
<v Speaker 1>I've had young Jamie in a very non</v>
<v Speaker 1>gateway lather on this.</v>

2550
01:52:10.541 --> 01:52:12.700
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aloe Vera Anti.</v>

2551
01:52:12.701 --> 01:52:16.030
<v Speaker 1>But I'm very distracted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just like a,</v>

2552
01:52:16.240 --> 01:52:19.930
<v Speaker 1>like almost like I have 100 things all</v>
<v Speaker 1>over my back.</v>

2553
01:52:20.380 --> 01:52:22.870
<v Speaker 1>Not No Bueno.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's 900 BC.</v>

2554
01:52:22.871 --> 01:52:25.840
<v Speaker 1>They think the old mex lived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's that estimate based on?</v>

2555
01:52:26.470 --> 01:52:29.650
<v Speaker 1>Because I saw something that was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it thought it was there were way older</v>

2556
01:52:29.651 --> 01:52:33.100
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wonderful.</v>

2557
01:52:33.140 --> 01:52:36.320
<v Speaker 1>I know the date from at least before 900</v>
<v Speaker 1>BC.</v>

2558
01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:38.320
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

2559
01:52:38.330 --> 01:52:41.900
<v Speaker 1>I think there's like a conventional way</v>
<v Speaker 1>of thinking and then there's an</v>

2560
01:52:41.901 --> 01:52:46.550
<v Speaker 1>alternative theory and the alternative</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was that they were way,</v>

2561
01:52:46.551 --> 01:52:47.780
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way older than that,</v>

2562
01:52:47.990 --> 01:52:50.270
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think they know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know who the Omex were,</v>

2563
01:52:51.760 --> 01:52:52.930
<v Speaker 1>but cool shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2564
01:52:52.931 --> 01:52:57.400
<v Speaker 1>they left behind these giant heads and</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2565
01:52:57.470 --> 01:53:00.940
<v Speaker 1>oh why'd you even do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one knows.</v>

2566
01:53:01.360 --> 01:53:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Have you seen that thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was watching this one documentary or</v>

2567
01:53:05.291 --> 01:53:10.080
<v Speaker 1>one television show where either on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazon and uh,</v>

2568
01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:12.940
<v Speaker 1>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've recently because of satellite</v>

2569
01:53:12.941 --> 01:53:17.941
<v Speaker 1>images found in city while they found</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they think are the thing is</v>

2570
01:53:18.161 --> 01:53:22.750
<v Speaker 1>evidence of hidden cities have evidence</v>
<v Speaker 1>of ancient cultures now in the Amazon.</v>

2571
01:53:23.350 --> 01:53:25.000
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it was Brazil,</v>

2572
01:53:25.530 --> 01:53:28.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it was Honduras,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they found,</v>

2573
01:53:28.061 --> 01:53:31.480
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like what would appears to be irrigation</v>

2574
01:53:31.481 --> 01:53:35.500
<v Speaker 1>structures and things that are carved</v>
<v Speaker 1>into the ground and things that look</v>

2575
01:53:35.501 --> 01:53:39.340
<v Speaker 1>like grids where they might've had</v>
<v Speaker 1>cities and streets.</v>

2576
01:53:39.910 --> 01:53:43.390
<v Speaker 1>That was the lost city of gold member</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were said last Silverado.</v>

2577
01:53:43.480 --> 01:53:44.231
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2578
01:53:44.231 --> 01:53:46.720
<v Speaker 1>The people are looking for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that one,</v>

2579
01:53:46.721 --> 01:53:50.680
<v Speaker 1>a European explored,</v>
<v Speaker 1>went looking for and wound up dying and</v>

2580
01:53:51.220 --> 01:53:54.760
<v Speaker 1>they believe it got eaten by cannibals</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they're making a movie about</v>

2581
01:53:54.761 --> 01:53:55.480
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2582
01:53:55.480 --> 01:53:59.470
<v Speaker 1>We talked about this recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some movie about the lost city of gold</v>

2583
01:53:59.471 --> 01:54:00.700
<v Speaker 1>that's on its way.</v>

2584
01:54:00.770 --> 01:54:04.090
<v Speaker 2>I had a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it was Disney did one event</v>

2585
01:54:04.280 --> 01:54:07.780
<v Speaker 2>animation one like 20 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a bug.</v>

2586
01:54:08.570 --> 01:54:10.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's always been rumors that there</v>

2587
01:54:10.911 --> 01:54:14.630
<v Speaker 1>was these lost cities in the Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now thanks to satellite imagery,</v>

2588
01:54:14.631 --> 01:54:18.230
<v Speaker 1>they're starting to see things they</v>
<v Speaker 1>never saw before and starting to find</v>

2589
01:54:18.231 --> 01:54:20.960
<v Speaker 1>patterns and structures and it's cool</v>
<v Speaker 1>shit man.</v>

2590
01:54:20.961 --> 01:54:23.030
<v Speaker 1>His cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well it's what's really crazy is like if</v>

2591
01:54:23.031 --> 01:54:27.230
<v Speaker 1>we didn't have this stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how long would it be before there</v>

2592
01:54:27.231 --> 01:54:29.960
<v Speaker 1>was no evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would it be another thousand years?</v>

2593
01:54:30.290 --> 01:54:34.430
<v Speaker 1>So like how if you go back to when was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when were these structures with they</v>

2594
01:54:34.431 --> 01:54:36.440
<v Speaker 1>2000 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>were they a thousand years old?</v>

2595
01:54:36.740 --> 01:54:40.400
<v Speaker 1>So if we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we think about it like who knows what</v>

2596
01:54:40.401 --> 01:54:44.150
<v Speaker 1>was there in the Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who knows what was their 5,000 years</v>

2597
01:54:44.151 --> 01:54:45.500
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10,000 years ago.</v>

2598
01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:50.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean it could have been completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>lost civilizations that we just,</v>

2599
01:54:50.810 --> 01:54:53.200
<v Speaker 1>we'll never know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll never have any awareness of</v>

2600
01:54:55.330 --> 01:54:56.163
<v Speaker 2>you freaking out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2601
01:54:56.230 --> 01:54:59.080
<v Speaker 2>Look at you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm never to know.</v>

2602

<v Speaker 1>Do you have any plans other than you</v>
<v Speaker 1>said you were going to visit Eastern</v>

2603
01:55:03.650 --> 01:55:05.000
<v Speaker 1>Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lived in Guatemala.</v>

2604
01:55:05.001 --> 01:55:07.580
<v Speaker 1>Now you're going to live there for</v>
<v Speaker 1>awhile and do you have any other like</v>

2605
01:55:07.581 --> 01:55:09.410
<v Speaker 1>wild plans and places to go and</v>

2606
01:55:09.770 --> 01:55:12.380
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2608
01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:15.020
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>other than that,</v>

2610
01:55:16.101 --> 01:55:18.620
<v Speaker 2>that's about as far ahead as I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean honestly,</v>

2611
01:55:18.621 --> 01:55:21.380
<v Speaker 2>like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I came to my buddy was in Ohio,</v>

2617
01:55:32.231 --> 01:55:34.510
<v Speaker 2>lunchtime and then we went for a hike in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the afternoon.</v>

2618
01:55:34.511 --> 01:55:36.670
<v Speaker 2>It's just gorgeous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's like the fact that you can</v>

2619

<v Speaker 2>go surfing in the day and then for a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a gorgeous.</v>

2620
01:55:39.910 --> 01:55:42.190

<v Speaker 2>snake on forever.</v>

2621
01:55:42.730 --> 01:55:44.530
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>California</v>

<v Speaker 1>maybe California is on the radar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>California is pretty bad ass.</v>

2624
01:55:48.750 --> 01:55:50.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Northern California is really intense,</v>

2625
01:55:50.821 --> 01:55:52.680
<v Speaker 1>like the rain forest area where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>redwoods are.</v>

2626
01:55:52.681 --> 01:55:55.670

01:56:07.741 --> 01:56:10.050
<v Speaker 1>constantly raining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's really interesting about the</v>

2634
01:56:10.051 --> 01:56:14.340
<v Speaker 1>forest is the other so many pine trees</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's so many leaves fall at the</v>

2635
01:56:14.341 --> 01:56:17.160
<v Speaker 1>forest floor is really soft.</v>

<v Speaker 1>everywhere you walk.</v>

2638
01:56:22.170 --> 01:56:25.100

<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2647
01:56:40.170 --> 01:56:43.050
<v Speaker 1>We found a lot of white guys out camp</v>
<v Speaker 1>and looking for bigfoot.</v>

2648
01:56:43.550 --> 01:56:44.360
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2649
01:56:44.360 --> 01:56:46.440
<v Speaker 1>It was a joke that I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's what you don't find when you go</v>

2650
01:56:46.450 --> 01:56:50.200
<v Speaker 1>looking for bigfoot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Black people are more likely to find big</v>

2651
01:56:50.201 --> 01:56:53.220
<v Speaker 1>foot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you are black people looking for</v>

2652
01:56:53.221 --> 01:56:56.180
<v Speaker 1>big bunch of white guys camping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's accurate.</v>

2653
01:56:56.600 --> 01:56:58.740
<v Speaker 1>And it was interesting because one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the guys that we've talked to is like,</v>

2654
01:56:58.741 --> 01:57:00.560
<v Speaker 1>hey look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even when we don't find anything least</v>

2655
01:57:00.570 --> 01:57:02.040
<v Speaker 1>we're out here camping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2656
01:57:02.070 --> 01:57:03.930
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the worst case scenario is pretty</v>

2657
01:57:03.931 --> 01:57:05.670
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a lot of people out there</v>

2658
01:57:05.671 --> 01:57:09.750
<v Speaker 1>that claim they seen things but I just</v>
<v Speaker 1>think they're seeing bears because there</v>

2659
01:57:09.751 --> 01:57:11.880
<v Speaker 1>are bears up there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of black bears up there</v>

2660
01:57:11.970 --> 01:57:15.780
<v Speaker 1>and you see them in the distance and</v>
<v Speaker 1>bears do walk on two legs all the time.</v>

2661
01:57:16.260 --> 01:57:19.440
<v Speaker 1>And I think if you see one in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>distance and you see that image and you</v>

2662
01:57:19.441 --> 01:57:24.260
<v Speaker 1>convince yourself that that's bear or</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big foot rather not a bear.</v>

2663
01:57:24.380 --> 01:57:28.200
<v Speaker 1>And after awhile your memory starts to</v>
<v Speaker 1>memories are so bad.</v>

2664
01:57:28.440 --> 01:57:31.470
<v Speaker 1>Like the human memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in inherently shitty.</v>

2665
01:57:31.700 --> 01:57:34.500
<v Speaker 1>I mean a few people have like very clear</v>
<v Speaker 1>distinct memories from the past.</v>

2666
01:57:34.860 --> 01:57:38.400
<v Speaker 1>But I think even though you're sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>repeating them to yourself and</v>

2667
01:57:38.401 --> 01:57:41.190
<v Speaker 1>ingraining them in your head until you</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe it until you believe him.</v>

2668
01:57:41.460 --> 01:57:44.190
<v Speaker 1>But I think like what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what our memories are good for is like</v>

2669
01:57:44.191 --> 01:57:47.100
<v Speaker 1>recent events or things that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic,</v>

2670
01:57:47.101 --> 01:57:49.350
<v Speaker 1>like don't go near the snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the snake will kill you.</v>

2671
01:57:49.680 --> 01:57:51.900
<v Speaker 1>You know that spiders got venom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2672
01:57:51.930 --> 01:57:53.160
<v Speaker 1>I remember the spider,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2673
01:57:53.161 --> 01:57:58.161
<v Speaker 1>but like as far as like seeing things</v>
<v Speaker 1>and being around especially unusual</v>

2674
01:57:58.171 --> 01:58:01.860
<v Speaker 1>events that are very unique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like seeing a seven foot tall monkey in</v>

2675
01:58:01.861 --> 01:58:04.170
<v Speaker 1>the woods or believing you saw that</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2676
01:58:04.440 --> 01:58:05.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no doubt.</v>

2677
01:58:05.030 --> 01:58:07.360
<v Speaker 1>I think he's seen as a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the studies of the hub,</v>

2678
01:58:07.740 --> 01:58:12.120
<v Speaker 1>like a criminal break into a room and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they'll ask all the other witnesses</v>

2679
01:58:12.330 --> 01:58:14.910
<v Speaker 1>how tall was he?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like was he black?</v>

2680
01:58:14.911 --> 01:58:16.890
<v Speaker 1>Was He white?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like all these specific characteristics</v>

2681
01:58:16.891 --> 01:58:19.830
<v Speaker 1>and like they're all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2682
01:58:20.580 --> 01:58:24.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Human memory is unbelievably bad and we</v>

2683
01:58:24.390 --> 01:58:27.660
<v Speaker 1>count on it so much and people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>always like telling you stories about</v>

2684
01:58:27.661 --> 01:58:30.230
<v Speaker 1>their childhood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember when this hub and he was</v>

2685
01:58:30.231 --> 01:58:31.260
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you really?</v>

2686
01:58:31.620 --> 01:58:33.560
<v Speaker 1>How much do you really remember?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

2687
01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:36.780
<v Speaker 1>you might really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how delusional are you?</v>

2688
01:58:36.840 --> 01:58:38.500
<v Speaker 1>That's the other part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how,</v>

2689
01:58:38.520 --> 01:58:41.500
<v Speaker 1>how much do you remember of things like</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is,</v>

2690
01:58:41.740 --> 01:58:46.030
<v Speaker 1>how much do you distort reality to her</v>
<v Speaker 1>to fit within your narrative that you</v>

2691
01:58:46.031 --> 01:58:47.440
<v Speaker 1>enjoy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make a good story,</v>

2692
01:58:47.441 --> 01:58:48.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2693
01:58:48.230 --> 01:58:49.063
<v Speaker 1>Enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2694
01:58:49.720 --> 01:58:51.760
<v Speaker 1>You must run into a lot of those people</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're out there on the,</v>

2695
01:58:51.940 --> 01:58:53.200

<v Speaker 1>Maybe drunk.</v>

<v Speaker 1>She sees a bear.</v>

2707
01:59:24.940 --> 01:59:26.860
<v Speaker 1>She can't wait to call the police.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

2708
01:59:26.861 --> 01:59:29.200
<v Speaker 1>my life has meaning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Had 50 years old.</v>

2709
01:59:29.201 --> 01:59:31.240
<v Speaker 1>I'm the first one in my town.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big.</v>

2710
01:59:32.370 --> 01:59:35.560
<v Speaker 1>She goes and tells people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you run into any wildlife?</v>

2711
01:59:35.800 --> 01:59:37.030
<v Speaker 1>It was weird when you're out there.</v>

2712
01:59:37.180 --> 01:59:39.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if bears are considered</v>
<v Speaker 2>weird,</v>

2713
01:59:39.250 --> 01:59:40.400
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>embarrassed.</v>

2714
01:59:40.550 --> 01:59:41.383
<v Speaker 2>There was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2715
01:59:42.640 --> 01:59:44.440
<v Speaker 2>it was 2013.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were like,</v>

2716
01:59:44.450 --> 01:59:46.970
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Congress seems to shut down about once</v>

2717
01:59:46.971 --> 01:59:50.840
<v Speaker 2>every decade for budget disagreements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2718
01:59:51.140 --> 01:59:53.090
<v Speaker 2>In 2013 they shut down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And um,</v>

2719
01:59:54.080 --> 01:59:54.831
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2720
01:59:54.831 --> 01:59:56.900
<v Speaker 2>so they shut down the whole national</v>
<v Speaker 2>park system.</v>

2721
01:59:56.930 --> 01:59:59.840
<v Speaker 2>So you eat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes through a lot of national parks.</v>

2722
01:59:59.841 --> 02:00:01.760
<v Speaker 2>So when they should have the national</v>
<v Speaker 2>park system,</v>

2723
02:00:01.761 --> 02:00:04.200
<v Speaker 2>nobody's allowed to go into the park,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning.</v>

2724
02:00:04.220 --> 02:00:05.840
<v Speaker 2>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the hell are we supposed to do?</v>

2725
02:00:05.841 --> 02:00:08.480
<v Speaker 2>Even hiking for four months and now</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're just going to say you can't go</v>

2726
02:00:08.481 --> 02:00:12.290
<v Speaker 2>through these sections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it ended up everybody just kind of</v>

2727
02:00:12.350 --> 02:00:14.900
<v Speaker 2>kept on hiking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the ranges would kick you out.</v>

2728
02:00:14.901 --> 02:00:17.720
<v Speaker 2>So she had to do is you'd hike at night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh God,</v>

2729
02:00:17.721 --> 02:00:19.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you're hiking at night.</v>

2730
02:00:19.430 --> 02:00:21.830
<v Speaker 2>But the best thing about hiking unite as</v>
<v Speaker 2>a wildlife,</v>

2731
02:00:22.220 --> 02:00:23.360
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's like you start.</v>

2732
02:00:23.810 --> 02:00:26.510
<v Speaker 2>And so like specifically Shenandoah</v>
<v Speaker 2>national park,</v>

2733
02:00:27.050 --> 02:00:30.200
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gets a ton of visitors.</v>

2734
02:00:30.201 --> 02:00:31.760
<v Speaker 2>And so when they shut down the national</v>
<v Speaker 2>park,</v>

2735
02:00:31.761 --> 02:00:35.870
<v Speaker 2>the only people in there were us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was like three hikers for this 100</v>

2736
02:00:35.871 --> 02:00:38.360
<v Speaker 2>mile section of park.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was like,</v>

2737
02:00:38.480 --> 02:00:41.120
<v Speaker 2>and the Shenandoah national park,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe is one of the highest</v>

2738
02:00:41.121 --> 02:00:43.310
<v Speaker 2>concentrated black bird populations in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the country.</v>

2739
02:00:43.370 --> 02:00:46.850
<v Speaker 2>Oh Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you have like no disturbance and you</v>

2740
02:00:46.851 --> 02:00:48.110
<v Speaker 2>have all these barriers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

2741
02:00:48.590 --> 02:00:49.311
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2742
02:00:49.311 --> 02:00:50.990
<v Speaker 2>we'd be hiking the night I was actually</v>
<v Speaker 2>alone,</v>

2743
02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:51.861
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at this point.</v>

2744
02:00:51.861 --> 02:00:52.940
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2745
02:00:52.941 --> 02:00:54.910
<v Speaker 2>I was hiking through the night one night</v>
<v Speaker 2>and yeah,</v>

2746
02:00:54.950 --> 02:00:59.950
<v Speaker 2>like the sun was rising and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a bear's will go to sleep at night</v>

2747
02:01:00.411 --> 02:01:05.411
<v Speaker 2>and the trees and when you pass by them</v>
<v Speaker 2>you triberr and they'll come out of the</v>

2748
02:01:05.781 --> 02:01:09.370
<v Speaker 2>tree and the claw their way down the</v>
<v Speaker 2>tree and you know,</v>

2749
02:01:09.540 --> 02:01:10.730
<v Speaker 2>it's a slow their fall.</v>

2750
02:01:11.090 --> 02:01:13.880
<v Speaker 2>But it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think I saw 15 beers that morning.</v>

2751
02:01:15.350 --> 02:01:17.510
<v Speaker 2>I was just cool though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was cool.</v>

2752
02:01:17.590 --> 02:01:20.390
<v Speaker 2>It was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now when you're hiking a using</v>

2753
02:01:20.391 --> 02:01:23.030
<v Speaker 2>headlamps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are you just going by the moonlight or</v>

2754
02:01:23.090 --> 02:01:24.110
<v Speaker 2>both?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2755
02:01:24.111 --> 02:01:25.610
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>moonlight if you can.</v>

2756
02:01:25.660 --> 02:01:27.110
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's surprising like your,</v>

2757
02:01:27.300 --> 02:01:29.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your eyes adjust and the night I have a</v>

2758
02:01:29.091 --> 02:01:31.430
<v Speaker 2>lot of times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you're under like heavy trees,</v>

2759
02:01:31.431 --> 02:01:32.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not going to work.</v>

2760
02:01:32.331 --> 02:01:33.320
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hadn't headlamps.</v>

2761

2765
02:01:42.891 --> 02:01:45.810
<v Speaker 2>couple of weeks until they settled it</v>
<v Speaker 2>committed.</v>

2766
02:01:46.260 --> 02:01:49.580
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is a range of really gonna arrest</v>

<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

2778
02:02:11.170 --> 02:02:15.580
<v Speaker 1>you came up with this because you needed</v>
<v Speaker 1>more nutrition while you were out there.</v>

2779
02:02:15.581 --> 02:02:17.980
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to find good stuff to eat.</v>

<v Speaker 2>5,100 miles a day and then you camp out</v>

2785
02:02:31.571 --> 02:02:34.060
<v Speaker 2>at night.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So did that New Zealand for three or</v>

2786
02:02:34.061 --> 02:02:38.020
<v Speaker 2>four months and it was the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like burning a ton of</v>

2787
02:02:38.021 --> 02:02:38.770
<v Speaker 2>calories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men,</v>

<v Speaker 2>right after that trip on the Appalachian</v>

2791
02:02:47.201 --> 02:02:49.990
<v Speaker 2>trail and the backpacking food consisted</v>
<v Speaker 2>of,</v>

2792
02:02:50.020 --> 02:02:51.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those dehydrated freeze dried meals that</v>

2793
02:02:51.851 --> 02:02:54.040
<v Speaker 2>you add hot water to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2794
02:02:54.670 --> 02:02:59.670
<v Speaker 2>those things like I don't like stopping</v>

<v Speaker 2>and like the meal options were bars,</v>

2798
02:03:07.421 --> 02:03:09.970
<v Speaker 2>other bars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bars usually cap out at like 200</v>

2799
02:03:09.971 --> 02:03:12.190
<v Speaker 2>calories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>250 even meal replacements.</v>

2800
02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:14.830
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the highest calorie meal replacement bar</v>

2801
02:03:14.831 --> 02:03:15.664
<v Speaker 2>on the market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2802
02:03:15.670 --> 02:03:17.310
<v Speaker 2>it was a 400 calorie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2803

<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and not to mention that like heavily</v>

2806
02:03:23.051 --> 02:03:23.910
<v Speaker 2>processed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2807
02:03:23.911 --> 02:03:25.270
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just didn't want to put up much of</v>

2808
02:03:25.271 --> 02:03:26.380
<v Speaker 2>that crap in me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2809
02:03:26.440 --> 02:03:29.980
<v Speaker 2>and I mean to add another thing was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>just balanced nutrition.</v>

2810
02:03:29.981 --> 02:03:31.540
<v Speaker 2>Some bars would have fiber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

2811
02:03:31.541 --> 02:03:33.460
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't someone have protein,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some wouldn't.</v>

2812
02:03:33.461 --> 02:03:35.620
<v Speaker 2>Someone have carbs and witnessed like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

2813
02:03:35.621 --> 02:03:36.970
<v Speaker 2>I need nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm,</v>

2814
02:03:37.030 --> 02:03:39.670
<v Speaker 2>I'm really burning up to five to 6,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>calories a day,</v>

2815
02:03:39.700 --> 02:03:40.540
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2816
02:03:41.100 --> 02:03:45.040
<v Speaker 2>so that kind of idea of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the need for a big nutrition ready to</v>

2817
02:03:45.041 --> 02:03:47.170
<v Speaker 2>eat fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

2818
02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:47.950
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of eaten,</v>

2819
02:03:47.950 --> 02:03:52.900
<v Speaker 2>go kind of meal with something that had</v>
<v Speaker 2>been forming in my mind is I hiked a lot</v>

2820
02:03:52.901 --> 02:03:56.230
<v Speaker 2>of times we were drinking olive oil</v>
<v Speaker 2>practically and drinking honey and</v>

2821
02:03:56.740 --> 02:04:00.220
<v Speaker 2>drinking peanut butter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like anything you could get to</v>

2822
02:04:00.221 --> 02:04:02.440
<v Speaker 2>load in the calories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I'm,</v>

2823
02:04:02.441 --> 02:04:03.820
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a big dude so I was like I</v>

2824
02:04:03.821 --> 02:04:06.550
<v Speaker 2>couldn't afford to lose that much weight</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I was losing weight.</v>

2825
02:04:06.670 --> 02:04:09.880
<v Speaker 2>I'm so green belly kind of came up with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea when I was hiking.</v>

2826
02:04:09.881 --> 02:04:12.820
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's make something that packs in some</v>

2827
02:04:12.821 --> 02:04:13.780
<v Speaker 2>calories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2828
02:04:13.850 --> 02:04:15.080
<v Speaker 1>pack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did you do that though?</v>

2829
02:04:15.081 --> 02:04:17.360
<v Speaker 1>How did you like these things are super</v>
<v Speaker 1>dense,</v>

2830
02:04:17.361 --> 02:04:22.280
<v Speaker 1>like for people that are listening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm holding this bag and as two bars in</v>

2831
02:04:22.281 --> 02:04:25.340
<v Speaker 1>it and a dude I eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've eaten these before.</v>

2832
02:04:25.341 --> 02:04:29.120
<v Speaker 1>I've eaten two bars and I'm good for</v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking a day,</v>

2833
02:04:30.870 --> 02:04:33.290
<v Speaker 1>just a normal day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like not hiking or anything crazy,</v>

2834
02:04:33.291 --> 02:04:35.720
<v Speaker 1>but it's really dense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're heavy,</v>

2835
02:04:36.350 --> 02:04:40.780
<v Speaker 1>like you hear that phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's a brick of food.</v>

2836
02:04:41.410 --> 02:04:43.920
<v Speaker 1>Like how did you figure out how to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

2837
02:04:44.250 --> 02:04:46.980
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew nutritionally I had an idea of</v>

2838
02:04:46.981 --> 02:04:50.370
<v Speaker 2>where I wanted it to be or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a concept for like this kind of</v>

2839
02:04:50.371 --> 02:04:52.410
<v Speaker 2>ultimate backpacking meal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2840
02:04:52.450 --> 02:04:55.380
<v Speaker 2>and then I worked with a food scientist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I knew that I knew nothing about</v>

2841
02:04:55.381 --> 02:04:58.860
<v Speaker 2>nutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just kind of knew I wanted to scratch</v>

2842
02:04:58.861 --> 02:04:59.970
<v Speaker 2>my own itch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2843
02:04:59.971 --> 02:05:03.300
<v Speaker 2>I had an itch and I wanted a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted a better backpacking meal.</v>

2844
02:05:03.301 --> 02:05:06.210
<v Speaker 2>So I knew conceptually what I wanted it</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be.</v>

2845
02:05:07.160 --> 02:05:10.210
<v Speaker 2>And then after playing around my mom's</v>
<v Speaker 2>kitchen trying to get something,</v>

2846
02:05:10.240 --> 02:05:12.390
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is way over my head,</v>

2847
02:05:12.391 --> 02:05:14.670
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like trying to get the nutritional</v>

2848
02:05:14.730 --> 02:05:16.920
<v Speaker 2>nutritional profile where I want it to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be good at,</v>

2849
02:05:16.930 --> 02:05:20.130
<v Speaker 2>to taste good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like ingredients that don't react with</v>

2850
02:05:20.131 --> 02:05:24.510
<v Speaker 2>each other and spoil and then trying to</v>
<v Speaker 2>get it to literally form together and</v>

2851
02:05:24.511 --> 02:05:25.230
<v Speaker 2>not fall apart.</v>

2852
02:05:25.230 --> 02:05:29.400
<v Speaker 2>It's like you start like having this</v>
<v Speaker 2>really complicated stuff as I try to</v>

2853
02:05:29.440 --> 02:05:30.560
<v Speaker 2>just find her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2854
02:05:30.620 --> 02:05:32.520
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>search around and see,</v>

2855
02:05:32.521 --> 02:05:33.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what kind of person who can help me.</v>

2856
02:05:33.751 --> 02:05:37.380
<v Speaker 2>I was looking right in nutritionists and</v>
<v Speaker 2>chefs and all that kind of stuff and</v>

2857
02:05:37.381 --> 02:05:41.610
<v Speaker 2>ended up coming with the term food</v>
<v Speaker 2>scientists and food scientists helped me</v>

2858
02:05:41.611 --> 02:05:43.590
<v Speaker 2>really formulate the meal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

2859
02:05:43.591 --> 02:05:44.161
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2860
02:05:44.161 --> 02:05:48.540
<v Speaker 2>then it was just kind of a feedback game</v>
<v Speaker 2>from what he could do a from a</v>

2861
02:05:48.541 --> 02:05:52.860
<v Speaker 2>nutritional point of view from a shelf</v>
<v Speaker 2>life and flavor profile.</v>

2862
02:05:53.190 --> 02:05:55.200
<v Speaker 2>Then it was just making sure the darn</v>
<v Speaker 2>things tasted good,</v>

2863
02:05:55.201 --> 02:05:56.000
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

2864
02:05:56.000 --> 02:06:00.240
<v Speaker 2>so I went to like a hiking festival,</v>
<v Speaker 2>handed out hundreds of samples,</v>

2865
02:06:00.630 --> 02:06:03.660
<v Speaker 2>just got a bunch of feedback from hikers</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then um,</v>

2866
02:06:03.750 --> 02:06:05.730
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of ran with it and um,</v>

2867
02:06:05.970 --> 02:06:06.990
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's been doing well.</v>

2868

2869
02:06:09.991 --> 02:06:10.771
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

02:06:19.461 --> 02:06:20.330
<v Speaker 2>dot dot.dot banana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2878
02:06:20.331 --> 02:06:21.640
<v Speaker 2>We have been in chips and then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

2879
02:06:21.910 --> 02:06:24.160
<v Speaker 1>good shit dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real Scott.</v>

2880
02:06:24.400 --> 02:06:27.880
<v Speaker 1>I'm trying to stay on a ketogenic diet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A funny joke.</v>

2881
02:06:28.330 --> 02:06:29.230
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah man,</v>

2882
02:06:29.231 --> 02:06:30.700
<v Speaker 1>we got,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got high carbs.</v>

2883
02:06:30.760 --> 02:06:32.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not going to work on a cheat</v>

2884
02:06:32.771 --> 02:06:33.640
<v Speaker 1>mail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are good.</v>

2885
02:06:33.641 --> 02:06:36.410
<v Speaker 1>Or if I'm desperado for food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also she,</v>

2886
02:06:36.520 --> 02:06:41.520
<v Speaker 1>you can think about a ketogenic diets as</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can every now and then fuck up as</v>

2887
02:06:42.521 --> 02:06:43.870
<v Speaker 1>long as you're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2888
02:06:43.871 --> 02:06:47.080
<v Speaker 1>as long as you're pretty consistent with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a high fat content diet.</v>

2889
02:06:47.320 --> 02:06:52.220
<v Speaker 1>And then what I'll do is I'll take an</v>
<v Speaker 1>exogenous ketone can take a like,</v>

2890
02:06:52.360 --> 02:06:55.870
<v Speaker 1>drinks that you mix up that put you in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>ketogenic state even after you could</v>

2891
02:06:55.871 --> 02:06:59.230
<v Speaker 1>drink like a whole coca cola and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>drink one of these key to genic drinks</v>

2892
02:06:59.231 --> 02:07:01.210
<v Speaker 1>and it knocks you back in a state of</v>
<v Speaker 1>ketosis.</v>

2893
02:07:01.420 --> 02:07:02.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2894
02:07:02.441 --> 02:07:04.450
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty scientific shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy,</v>

2895
02:07:04.720 --> 02:07:06.400
<v Speaker 1>dom d'agostino invented it.</v>

2896
02:07:06.440 --> 02:07:08.890
<v Speaker 1>He's a scientist at the University of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Florida.</v>

2897
02:07:09.550 --> 02:07:10.450
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2898
02:07:10.451 --> 02:07:12.100
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's ways you can manipulate your</v>

2899
02:07:12.101 --> 02:07:16.030
<v Speaker 1>metabolism that way where it</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically burns fat.</v>

2900
02:07:16.120 --> 02:07:18.410
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the big benefits is your,</v>

2901
02:07:18.440 --> 02:07:20.050
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your appetite.</v>

2902
02:07:20.440 --> 02:07:24.370
<v Speaker 1>Appetite suppressants amazing because if</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go on and I did,</v>

2903
02:07:24.700 --> 02:07:26.710
<v Speaker 1>I do switch over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if I cheat,</v>

2904
02:07:26.770 --> 02:07:29.440
<v Speaker 1>like if I go on vacation or something</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that and I just started eating</v>

2905
02:07:29.441 --> 02:07:31.150
<v Speaker 1>tacos or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you,</v>

2906
02:07:31.210 --> 02:07:33.910
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body goes into carbohydrate burning</v>

2907
02:07:33.911 --> 02:07:35.950
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you way hungrier,</v>

2908
02:07:36.130 --> 02:07:39.190
<v Speaker 1>like you burned through that</v>
<v Speaker 1>carbohydrate pretty quickly.</v>

2909
02:07:39.191 --> 02:07:43.030
<v Speaker 1>It's quick burning fuel and then your</v>
<v Speaker 1>body doesn't have the carbs anymore.</v>

2910
02:07:43.040 --> 02:07:44.650
<v Speaker 1>So then you go into this real hungry</v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

2911
02:07:44.980 --> 02:07:48.220
<v Speaker 1>Whereas if you're in a ketogenic state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body's burning fat,</v>

2912
02:07:48.221 --> 02:07:50.860
<v Speaker 1>you're eating fats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then when there's no more food,</v>

2913
02:07:51.010 --> 02:07:55.840
<v Speaker 1>your body starts burning it's own fat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so you don't get that crazy hunger</v>

2914
02:07:55.841 --> 02:07:58.900
<v Speaker 1>craving that you get when you're in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>car based Diet and there's,</v>

2915
02:07:58.930 --> 02:08:01.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's arguments for both sides and um,</v>

2916
02:08:01.571 --> 02:08:02.980
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to bring in some people that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2917
02:08:03.340 --> 02:08:06.310
<v Speaker 1>are anti ketogenic diet as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so get</v>

2918
02:08:06.540 --> 02:08:08.600
<v Speaker 2>balanced perspective on it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I listened to 'em,</v>

2919
02:08:09.060 --> 02:08:11.070
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember his name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a nutritionist.</v>

2920
02:08:11.280 --> 02:08:14.130
<v Speaker 2>He had written a book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was on your podcast a while ago.</v>

2921
02:08:14.210 --> 02:08:18.060
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] Chris crusher.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gary tobbs the case against sugar.</v>

2922
02:08:18.150 --> 02:08:20.610
<v Speaker 2>Please not a nutritionist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is pretty recently.</v>

2923
02:08:21.280 --> 02:08:25.290
<v Speaker 2>Robb wolf real recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanna say it was real recent wired to</v>

2924
02:08:25.291 --> 02:08:26.640
<v Speaker 2>eat robb wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sounds,</v>

2925
02:08:26.780 --> 02:08:27.613
<v Speaker 2>that sounds right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rob.</v>

2926
02:08:27.800 --> 02:08:31.380
<v Speaker 2>But the level of nutrition that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that guy knew,</v>

2927
02:08:31.440 --> 02:08:32.800
<v Speaker 2>I was fascinated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's rob.</v>

2928
02:08:33.000 --> 02:08:33.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that must be wrong,</v>

2929
02:08:33.890 --> 02:08:34.723
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2930
02:08:35.390 --> 02:08:37.300
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was impressive.</v>

2931
02:08:37.480 --> 02:08:41.500
<v Speaker 1>He's the actual guy that invented the</v>
<v Speaker 1>concept of quote unquote bulletproof</v>

2932
02:08:41.501 --> 02:08:44.980
<v Speaker 1>coffee that got kind of stole it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robb Wolf's concept came first and he</v>

2933
02:08:44.981 --> 02:08:49.981
<v Speaker 1>wrote about it in 2005,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of adding mct oil and butter to</v>

2934
02:08:50.260 --> 02:08:52.420
<v Speaker 1>give healthy fats with coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2935
02:08:52.421 --> 02:08:55.540
<v Speaker 1>Rob is a scientist and he's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like way ahead of the curve.</v>

2936
02:08:56.150 --> 02:08:59.790
<v Speaker 2>June and oppressive like Kilz</v>
<v Speaker 2>conversation was just interesting.</v>

2937
02:09:00.370 --> 02:09:01.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of those guys out there</v>

2938
02:09:01.781 --> 02:09:04.180
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really a fascinating time when it</v>

2939
02:09:04.181 --> 02:09:08.170
<v Speaker 1>comes to nutrition and and also what he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was really good about him is he's</v>

2940
02:09:08.171 --> 02:09:10.870
<v Speaker 1>constantly experimenting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's very honest and very open about his</v>

2941
02:09:10.871 --> 02:09:14.940
<v Speaker 1>experiments and he's also really adamant</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the possibility,</v>

2942
02:09:15.000 --> 02:09:16.090
<v Speaker 1>not the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the hospital,</v>

2943
02:09:16.091 --> 02:09:20.860
<v Speaker 1>but the reality rather that people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>very different and everyone's</v>

2944
02:09:20.900 --> 02:09:24.400
<v Speaker 1>variability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The variability is very wide.</v>

2945
02:09:24.730 --> 02:09:28.840
<v Speaker 1>So like what is healthy for you might</v>
<v Speaker 1>not necessarily be healthy for me.</v>

2946
02:09:28.960 --> 02:09:32.050
<v Speaker 1>And what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what changes your blood sugar levels is</v>

2947
02:09:32.051 --> 02:09:33.700
<v Speaker 1>not going to change mine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>

2948
02:09:33.701 --> 02:09:34.534
<v Speaker 1>very different</v>

2949
02:09:35.030 --> 02:09:37.360
<v Speaker 2>interesting stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like when you remember when</v>

2950
02:09:37.361 --> 02:09:40.010
<v Speaker 2>those conversation I was thinking like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there something out there?</v>

2951
02:09:40.011 --> 02:09:43.460
<v Speaker 2>Just a simple blood test or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's just like,</v>

2952
02:09:43.490 --> 02:09:45.490
<v Speaker 2>what do I need to know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's good for me?</v>

2953
02:09:45.500 --> 02:09:48.320
<v Speaker 2>What's the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the simplest way to find out is</v>

2954
02:09:48.321 --> 02:09:49.400
<v Speaker 2>this good?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this bad?</v>

2955
02:09:49.500 --> 02:09:50.420
<v Speaker 2>What do I need?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2956
02:09:50.610 --> 02:09:53.520
<v Speaker 1>really just have to experiment and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>on top of that there's a lot of other</v>

2957
02:09:53.521 --> 02:09:55.050
<v Speaker 1>variables like how much sleep are you</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting?</v>

2958
02:09:55.051 --> 02:09:56.330
<v Speaker 1>What's your cortisol levels?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2959
02:09:56.331 --> 02:09:59.580
<v Speaker 1>how much stress are you under?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And those factors also have to be taken</v>

2960
02:09:59.581 --> 02:10:02.460
<v Speaker 1>into consideration when you formulate a</v>
<v Speaker 1>diet because you're.</v>

2961
02:10:02.470 --> 02:10:05.340
<v Speaker 1>It'll vary depending upon your stress</v>
<v Speaker 1>levels.</v>

2962
02:10:05.370 --> 02:10:05.840
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

2963
02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:07.130
<v Speaker 2>complicated stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Very,</v>

2964
02:10:07.220 --> 02:10:10.460
<v Speaker 2>very complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But these delicious shit.</v>
