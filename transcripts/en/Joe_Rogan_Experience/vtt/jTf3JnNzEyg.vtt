00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches.</v>

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.460
<v Speaker 1>I've been watching some pro wrestling.</v>

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.260
<v Speaker 2>Totally predicted what was going to happen with this John [inaudible] Brock</v>

4
00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:11.510
<v Speaker 2>Lesnar.</v>

5
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:11.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

6
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.700
<v Speaker 2>You knew the thing out about it.</v>

7
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:15.630
<v Speaker 2>Bronc Lesnar,</v>

8
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.520
<v Speaker 2>you played it out long in advance perfectly.</v>

9
00:00:18.521 --> 00:00:20.130
<v Speaker 2>You knew exactly how it was going to go down.</v>

10
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.310
<v Speaker 2>And you're saying that it sets up something in the future?</v>

11
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.851
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

12
00:00:23.851 --> 00:00:24.241
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

13
00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:26.040
<v Speaker 1>They offered me a full time writing job.</v>

14
00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:27.990
<v Speaker 1>I can talk about it now cause I'm not getting it.</v>

15
00:00:27.991 --> 00:00:28.741
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing it.</v>

16
00:00:28.741 --> 00:00:33.180
<v Speaker 1>But a couple months ago they offered me a full time job to move to Stamford,</v>

17
00:00:33.181 --> 00:00:33.810
<v Speaker 1>Connecticut.</v>

18
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:34.021
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

19
00:00:34.021 --> 00:00:35.040
<v Speaker 1>After one meeting,</v>

20
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.240
<v Speaker 1>a meeting like this,</v>

21
00:00:36.241 --> 00:00:38.100
<v Speaker 1>that was about an hour and a half at the end they go,</v>

22
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.990
<v Speaker 1>how would you feel about moving to Stamford,</v>

23
00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:44.991
<v Speaker 1>Connecticut for one year job with the WWE writing hung the creative side.</v>

24
00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:45.900
<v Speaker 1>And I go,</v>

25
00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.250
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have to think about that.</v>

26
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.473
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

27
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.050
<v Speaker 1>it didn't pan out because I didn't want to move to Stanford,</v>

28
00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:54.060
<v Speaker 1>Connecticut and working nine to five,</v>

29
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.820
<v Speaker 1>even though it's really good money and everything.</v>

30
00:00:56.821 --> 00:00:58.770
<v Speaker 1>But you would have to go to,</v>

31
00:00:58.771 --> 00:01:02.670
<v Speaker 1>you drive to a la or drive to New York rather still do spots,</v>

32
00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.460
<v Speaker 1>which turns out it's just a 45 minute drive.</v>

33
00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:06.294
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

34
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.610
<v Speaker 1>but the job is very grueling.</v>

35
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:09.840
<v Speaker 1>The WWE thing,</v>

36
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:10.430
<v Speaker 1>it's not a,</v>

37
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.080
<v Speaker 1>it's not like TV comedy writing job.</v>

38
00:01:13.081 --> 00:01:13.890
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>

39
00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.670
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to answer to Vince Mcmahon like Tony,</v>

40
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.590
<v Speaker 1>would you do get stoned before writing this ideal?</v>

41
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.661
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that's what it was?</v>

42
00:01:20.661 --> 00:01:23.010
<v Speaker 1>Or probably what would you say to him?</v>

43
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.191
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

44
00:01:23.191 --> 00:01:24.024
<v Speaker 1>if you want to say,</v>

45
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.490
<v Speaker 1>I say yeah and I was still,</v>

46
00:01:26.491 --> 00:01:28.680
<v Speaker 1>when I wrote all the great ideas that you like sir.</v>

47
00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.110
<v Speaker 1>Well you have a point.</v>

48
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.921
<v Speaker 1>I think Vince,</v>

49
00:01:31.921 --> 00:01:33.030
<v Speaker 1>we tried to get you on steroids.</v>

50
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.770
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

51
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.781
<v Speaker 1>he'd probably get,</v>

52
00:01:35.781 --> 00:01:35.860
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

53
00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:36.880
<v Speaker 2>we tried to get me to eat.</v>

54
00:01:36.881 --> 00:01:39.700
<v Speaker 2>Be every chance he gets.</v>

55
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.920
<v Speaker 2>He brought it from my ranch.</v>

56
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.590
<v Speaker 2>Shot this myself this morning.</v>

57
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

58
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:47.820
<v Speaker 1>Well was it good money?</v>

59
00:01:47.821 --> 00:01:48.750
<v Speaker 1>Like serious money.</v>

60
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.190
<v Speaker 1>Super serious money.</v>

61
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.880
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

62
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.410
<v Speaker 1>Sanely serious money.</v>

63
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:53.253
<v Speaker 1>You came close.</v>

64
00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.900
<v Speaker 1>I was happy to get the offer.</v>

65
00:01:54.901 --> 00:01:57.390
<v Speaker 1>I took it as a victory and I love what I do.</v>

66
00:01:57.391 --> 00:01:58.680
<v Speaker 1>I love what I'm doing.</v>

67
00:01:58.681 --> 00:01:59.670
<v Speaker 1>And it might be crazy.</v>

68
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.780
<v Speaker 1>I'll never regret it.</v>

69
00:02:00.781 --> 00:02:01.590
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

70
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.820
<v Speaker 1>I think you regret it right now.</v>

71
00:02:02.821 --> 00:02:03.631
<v Speaker 1>I'm looking into your eyes.</v>

72
00:02:03.631 --> 00:02:04.170
<v Speaker 1>So yeah.</v>

73
00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.590
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

74
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.060
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a dream job for you.</v>

75
00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

76
00:02:06.511 --> 00:02:07.321
<v Speaker 1>sort of.</v>

77
00:02:07.321 --> 00:02:08.071
<v Speaker 1>But then again,</v>

78
00:02:08.071 --> 00:02:10.470
<v Speaker 1>what I do is sort of a dream job too,</v>

79
00:02:10.471 --> 00:02:13.620
<v Speaker 1>and giving up this dream job for that dream job would be crazy.</v>

80
00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.060
<v Speaker 1>You wouldn't have to give up this dream job.</v>

81
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.643
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

82
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:17.820
<v Speaker 1>it's a grueling,</v>

83
00:02:17.821 --> 00:02:18.780
<v Speaker 1>creepy job,</v>

84
00:02:18.781 --> 00:02:19.531
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately.</v>

85
00:02:19.531 --> 00:02:20.041
<v Speaker 1>Trust me,</v>

86
00:02:20.041 --> 00:02:20.671
<v Speaker 1>if it was,</v>

87
00:02:20.671 --> 00:02:20.771
<v Speaker 1>if,</v>

88
00:02:20.771 --> 00:02:23.610
<v Speaker 1>if the word on the streets was man writing for the WWE,</v>

89
00:02:23.611 --> 00:02:24.271
<v Speaker 1>it's the coolest.</v>

90
00:02:24.271 --> 00:02:24.960
<v Speaker 1>You can do anything.</v>

91
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.450
<v Speaker 1>I would have taken it and I would have lived in New York and it would have been</v>

92
00:02:27.451 --> 00:02:27.871
<v Speaker 1>amazing.</v>

93
00:02:27.871 --> 00:02:32.280
<v Speaker 1>I would have traveled to Stanford 45 minutes every morning on a subway and</v>

94
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.840
<v Speaker 1>steadily Dunnigan Stanford.</v>

95
00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:34.201
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

96
00:02:34.201 --> 00:02:35.190
<v Speaker 1>It would have been amazing.</v>

97
00:02:35.191 --> 00:02:36.300
<v Speaker 1>And I would have had any,</v>

98
00:02:36.301 --> 00:02:37.110
<v Speaker 1>I could have.</v>

99
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:38.070
<v Speaker 1>It was stupid.</v>

100
00:02:38.071 --> 00:02:38.720
<v Speaker 1>The amount of money.</v>

101
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.170
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to live in Stanford.</v>

102
00:02:40.171 --> 00:02:41.730
<v Speaker 1>You know what the problem with Connecticut is?</v>

103
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.070
<v Speaker 1>It's not really a state is a state.</v>

104
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.210
<v Speaker 1>But let's be honest,</v>

105
00:02:45.211 --> 00:02:46.044
<v Speaker 1>ladies and gentlemen,</v>

106
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.350
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

107
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.600
<v Speaker 1>you live in a highway between Boston and New York.</v>

108
00:02:48.601 --> 00:02:49.050
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

109
00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.010
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

110
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.160
<v Speaker 1>It's like they put some houses on the side of the highway and they call it a</v>

111
00:02:53.161 --> 00:02:53.850
<v Speaker 1>town,</v>

112
00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.010
<v Speaker 1>but that's what's really going on.</v>

113
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.601
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing,</v>

114
00:02:55.601 --> 00:02:57.510
<v Speaker 1>nothing's being done there and nuns be made there.</v>

115
00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:58.141
<v Speaker 1>What do you got?</v>

116
00:02:58.141 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>You've got the Glenn Beck and the WWE.</v>

117
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.470
<v Speaker 3>That's your entire state economy.</v>

118
00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.080
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

119
00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.411
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

<v Speaker 3>There's some other things I'm just fucking around.</v>

125
00:03:11.771 --> 00:03:12.700

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:17.710
<v Speaker 3>Connecticut sucks.</v>

129
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:18.011
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

130
00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:19.270
<v Speaker 3>it sucks and I know it sucks.</v>

131
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.790
<v Speaker 3>There's some great houses there.</v>

132
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.850
<v Speaker 3>Some nice neighborhoods,</v>

133
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:22.810
<v Speaker 3>crazy neighbor.</v>

134
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.100
<v Speaker 3>I have my friend Tommy Junior,</v>

135
00:03:24.101 --> 00:03:25.630
<v Speaker 3>one of my best friends lives in Connecticut.</v>

136
00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:26.590
<v Speaker 3>He tells me it sucks.</v>

137
00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:27.424
<v Speaker 3>I trust him.</v>

138
00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.283
<v Speaker 3>It's not a good spot.</v>

139
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.110
<v Speaker 3>When I used to drive there from Boston to New York,</v>

140
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:33.580
<v Speaker 3>I would always think like,</v>

141
00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:34.020
<v Speaker 3>why is,</v>

142
00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.110
<v Speaker 3>why aren't people stop in here?</v>

143
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:36.353
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

144
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.240
<v Speaker 3>WWE.</v>

145
00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.171
<v Speaker 3>But a lot of people,</v>

146
00:03:38.171 --> 00:03:43.171
<v Speaker 3>like David Letterman lived in Connecticut and drove into the city to do a show.</v>

147
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:44.643
<v Speaker 3>That's how he did it.</v>

148
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:45.131
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

149
00:03:45.131 --> 00:03:46.450
<v Speaker 3>But he's like reclusive,</v>

150
00:03:46.451 --> 00:03:47.110
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

151
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.943
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

152
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:48.790
<v Speaker 3>He likes being,</v>

153
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:50.710
<v Speaker 3>he needs to be away from everybody.</v>

154
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:52.780
<v Speaker 3>He's weird like that.</v>

155
00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.673
<v Speaker 3>And you're not.</v>

156
00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.820
<v Speaker 3>You missed her outgoing and that city partying it up at night,</v>

157
00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.620
<v Speaker 3>doing a little blow in the morning,</v>

158
00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.170
<v Speaker 3>pep you up right before class.</v>

159
00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.211
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

160
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:01.841
<v Speaker 3>for sure.</v>

161
00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:03.490
<v Speaker 3>You know me show up on the campus.</v>

162
00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.730
<v Speaker 3>Give Vince the paperwork that you wrote on the plane over there</v>

163
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.450
<v Speaker 3>toady.</v>

164
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.790
<v Speaker 1>This storyline makes zero sense.</v>

165
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.630
<v Speaker 3>What kind of story lines where you plan it?</v>

166
00:04:13.631 --> 00:04:13.930
<v Speaker 3>Did you,</v>

167
00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:14.710
<v Speaker 3>I know you did.</v>

168
00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:15.610
<v Speaker 3>I know you thought about it.</v>

169
00:04:15.611 --> 00:04:16.450
<v Speaker 3>Absolutely.</v>

170
00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:17.480
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

171
00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.050
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a,</v>

172
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.570
<v Speaker 1>I wrote a great storyline where,</v>

173
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

174
00:04:20.841 --> 00:04:22.730
<v Speaker 1>Brock Lesnar and a,</v>

175
00:04:22.731 --> 00:04:24.020
<v Speaker 1>in this past Wrestlemania,</v>

176
00:04:24.021 --> 00:04:25.940
<v Speaker 1>he'd beat the undertaker.</v>

177
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.940
<v Speaker 1>The undertaker's had a streak at Wrestlemania.</v>

178
00:04:28.941 --> 00:04:31.070
<v Speaker 1>He never loses at Wrestlemania.</v>

179
00:04:31.071 --> 00:04:35.000
<v Speaker 1>He was 21 and zero all time at Wrestlemania 21 years.</v>

180
00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.820
<v Speaker 1>He had never lost in this match against Brock Lesnar.</v>

181
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.841
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of,</v>

182
00:04:38.841 --> 00:04:42.860
<v Speaker 1>it was sort of set up so everybody just assumed the undertaker would win and</v>

183
00:04:42.861 --> 00:04:44.450
<v Speaker 1>then in a stunning move,</v>

184
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.591
<v Speaker 1>Brock,</v>

185
00:04:45.591 --> 00:04:49.170
<v Speaker 1>towards the end of it ends up beating the undertaker for the three counts.</v>

186
00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.330
<v Speaker 1>You want to see something funny?</v>

187
00:04:50.331 --> 00:04:50.901
<v Speaker 1>Look that up.</v>

188
00:04:50.901 --> 00:04:52.820
<v Speaker 1>Reaction shots of the audience.</v>

189
00:04:52.821 --> 00:04:53.570
<v Speaker 1>Don't do that.</v>

190
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

191
00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.540
<v Speaker 1>but this audience was stunned to people.</v>

192
00:04:56.541 --> 00:04:57.051
<v Speaker 1>Just so I know.</v>

193
00:04:57.051 --> 00:04:58.490
<v Speaker 1>What else jogs drawn that audience.</v>

194
00:04:58.491 --> 00:05:00.260
<v Speaker 1>A fucking simple card trick.</v>

195
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.831
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

196
00:05:00.831 --> 00:05:01.401
<v Speaker 1>come on.</v>

197
00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:02.420
<v Speaker 1>What are you talking about?</v>

198
00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.350
<v Speaker 1>Listen to code road.</v>

199
00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:06.620
<v Speaker 1>Silly Shit.</v>

200
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.731
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

201
00:05:07.731 --> 00:05:08.870
<v Speaker 1>It's all planned out.</v>

202
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:09.800
<v Speaker 1>It's obvious.</v>

203
00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.090
<v Speaker 1>It's not obvious.</v>

204
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:12.501
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely not.</v>

205
00:05:12.501 --> 00:05:13.370
<v Speaker 1>If it's planned out,</v>

206
00:05:13.371 --> 00:05:15.230
<v Speaker 1>why would it be obvious going to happen?</v>

207
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:17.010
<v Speaker 1>I know what's going to happen.</v>

208
00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.630
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's not the arena's.</v>

212
00:05:21.021 --> 00:05:23.300
<v Speaker 1>Not everybody in the arena was offered a full time,</v>

215
00:05:26.271 --> 00:05:28.600
<v Speaker 1>You're an expert in pro wrestling essentially.</v>

216
00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:29.391
<v Speaker 1>I've watched my whole,</v>

217
00:05:29.391 --> 00:05:32.360
<v Speaker 1>it was sorta like my replacement for not having a dad when I was a kid.</v>

218
00:05:32.361 --> 00:05:32.511
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

219
00:05:32.511 --> 00:05:34.130
<v Speaker 1>I would just sit there and watch these,</v>

220

<v Speaker 1>these storylines and these guys do all this crazy stuff.</v>

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:05.020
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>

295
00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:05.450
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

296
00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:07.580
<v Speaker 3>it was the total complete wild,</v>

297
00:08:07.581 --> 00:08:08.121
<v Speaker 3>wild west.</v>

298
00:08:08.121 --> 00:08:11.540
<v Speaker 3>And I don't know if he's written a book on this or he's gonna write a book on</v>

299
00:08:11.541 --> 00:08:12.374
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

300
00:08:12.410 --> 00:08:14.750
<v Speaker 3>but fucking a man listen to that shit.</v>

301
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:15.080
<v Speaker 3>Whiskey.</v>

302
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:16.380
<v Speaker 3>I bet he has written a book on it.</v>

303
00:08:16.381 --> 00:08:21.381
<v Speaker 3>I should find out what the book is been as rich Ben Mezrich I wonder what the</v>

304
00:08:22.551 --> 00:08:27.551
<v Speaker 3>direction of the economy and the trends and everything were before that</v>

305
00:08:28.071 --> 00:08:30.230
<v Speaker 3>exclusive group of people took that over.</v>

306
00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.220
<v Speaker 3>Cause it's,</v>

307
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:31.461
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

308
00:08:31.461 --> 00:08:33.830
<v Speaker 3>it seems like we're sort of in a way,</v>

309
00:08:33.831 --> 00:08:36.320
<v Speaker 3>heading that direction with our stuff.</v>

310
00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:42.320
<v Speaker 3>The top whatever percent has such a crazy amount of money compared to the rest</v>

311
00:08:42.321 --> 00:08:43.430
<v Speaker 3>of everybody.</v>

312
00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:43.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

313
00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.260
<v Speaker 3>Well it's close.</v>

314
00:08:45.290 --> 00:08:45.591
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

315
00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:45.801
<v Speaker 3>were,</v>

316
00:08:45.801 --> 00:08:46.700
<v Speaker 3>were pretty bad.</v>

317
00:08:46.701 --> 00:08:47.170
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

318
00:08:47.170 --> 00:08:49.250
<v Speaker 3>apparently it's nothing like Russia,</v>

319
00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.120
<v Speaker 3>like the,</v>

320
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.950
<v Speaker 3>these Russian oligarchs,</v>

321
00:08:53.090 --> 00:08:55.620
<v Speaker 3>they just dominated.</v>

322
00:08:55.650 --> 00:09:00.390
<v Speaker 3>They just figured out a way to completely dominate the entire economy of a giant</v>

323
00:09:00.391 --> 00:09:01.224
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

324
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:01.661
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's,</v>

325
00:09:01.661 --> 00:09:03.420
<v Speaker 3>it's listening to him talk about,</v>

326
00:09:03.421 --> 00:09:04.380
<v Speaker 3>it was fascinating.</v>

327
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.870
<v Speaker 3>That shows different now that Anthony's not there,</v>

328
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:09.210
<v Speaker 3>but Jimmy Norton is so fucking interesting.</v>

329
00:09:09.211 --> 00:09:10.021
<v Speaker 3>Hysterical.</v>

330
00:09:10.021 --> 00:09:10.471
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

331
00:09:10.471 --> 00:09:12.300
<v Speaker 3>an obese doing a great job with it too.</v>

332
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:13.590
<v Speaker 3>It's still a great show.</v>

333
00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:16.620
<v Speaker 3>This Guy Ben Mezrich was fascinating.</v>

334
00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:19.590
<v Speaker 3>Fuck Russia man.</v>

335
00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:20.424
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>

336
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:21.720
<v Speaker 3>They were talking about Putin,</v>

337
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.680
<v Speaker 3>but what a gangster Putin had to be to,</v>

338
00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.880
<v Speaker 3>to come back and lead the country after he left.</v>

339
00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:28.590
<v Speaker 3>Like he led the country,</v>

340
00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:30.040
<v Speaker 3>took off like the,</v>

341
00:09:30.041 --> 00:09:34.680
<v Speaker 3>the impose some sort of a term limit came back like no term limit in buck.</v>

342
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:35.490
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

343
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:36.360
<v Speaker 3>he's back again.</v>

344
00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:37.050
<v Speaker 3>Like he's,</v>

345
00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:39.030
<v Speaker 3>this is a second time running the country.</v>

346
00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.320
<v Speaker 3>Like he installed some sort of a puppet dictator or a puppet leader when he was</v>

347
00:09:43.321 --> 00:09:46.350
<v Speaker 3>gone and then came back and he's a former KGB agent.</v>

348
00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:48.270
<v Speaker 3>Like what the fuck man.</v>

349
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:49.121
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

350
00:09:49.121 --> 00:09:50.750
<v Speaker 1>there's a guy that a,</v>

351
00:09:50.751 --> 00:09:54.970
<v Speaker 1>a professional wrestler named Marie Seth that actually puts the Cutin on the,</v>

352
00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.320
<v Speaker 1>on the mega tron and the,</v>

353
00:09:56.450 --> 00:09:57.283
<v Speaker 1>and Tron.</v>

354
00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:57.521
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

355
00:09:57.521 --> 00:10:00.550
<v Speaker 1>every time he comes out and really gets the crowd riled up.</v>

356
00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.230
<v Speaker 1>Oh mother Russia,</v>

357
00:10:02.231 --> 00:10:04.840
<v Speaker 1>I promise I will defeat my victim for you.</v>

358
00:10:04.841 --> 00:10:06.250
<v Speaker 1>And it gets the whole crowd to hate him.</v>

359
00:10:06.251 --> 00:10:07.010
<v Speaker 1>And then I,</v>

360
00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:09.070
<v Speaker 1>and then a guy comes out and uh,</v>

361
00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:10.840
<v Speaker 1>he Rousseff usually wins.</v>

362
00:10:10.841 --> 00:10:14.470
<v Speaker 1>They let the Russian guy when cause it drives the crowd crazy and then you think</v>

363
00:10:14.471 --> 00:10:15.910
<v Speaker 1>anything can happen after that.</v>

364
00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:20.373
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>

365
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.640
<v Speaker 1>My favorite thing is to watch you respond to me.</v>

366
00:10:23.641 --> 00:10:24.474
<v Speaker 1>Talk about rats.</v>

367
00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:25.410
<v Speaker 3>What's wrong with you?</v>

368
00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.960
<v Speaker 3>You would love it around with you.</v>

369
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:29.270
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't love it.</v>

370
00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:30.173
<v Speaker 1>You'd be amazed.</v>

371
00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:31.013
<v Speaker 1>I'll bet you though.</v>

372
00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:36.080
<v Speaker 1>I bet you if I showed you a statistic of UFC fans being WWE fans,</v>

373
00:10:36.121 --> 00:10:40.140
<v Speaker 1>I bet you'd be shocked because before the UFC was all over everything and one of</v>

374
00:10:40.141 --> 00:10:41.550
<v Speaker 1>the only outlets that end,</v>

375
00:10:41.551 --> 00:10:42.090
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

376
00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:44.100
<v Speaker 1>I've been with the UFC since the beginning,</v>

377
00:10:44.250 --> 00:10:44.851
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

378
00:10:44.851 --> 00:10:46.120
<v Speaker 1>Like I mean like watching it,</v>

379
00:10:46.121 --> 00:10:48.930
<v Speaker 1>it's since the hoists days since voice and shamrock and all that.</v>

380
00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.960
<v Speaker 1>And that's because it's it.</v>

381
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.790
<v Speaker 1>Even though it's two totally different things.</v>

382
00:10:53.791 --> 00:10:55.980
<v Speaker 1>UFC is obviously an extremely,</v>

383
00:10:56.190 --> 00:10:57.023
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

384
00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:02.520
<v Speaker 1>crazy sport and WWE is completely entertainment with,</v>

385
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:02.790
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

386
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:04.350
<v Speaker 1>some injuries from time to time.</v>

387
00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:05.813
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

388
00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:06.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

389
00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:07.360
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

390
00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.800
<v Speaker 1>it was an outlet for anybody that wanted some crazy stuff.</v>

391
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:13.590
<v Speaker 1>Wwe and UFC fans.</v>

392
00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:14.760
<v Speaker 1>I bet there's a lot.</v>

393
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:18.170
<v Speaker 1>I would bet you that you're done talking.</v>

394
00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:19.023
<v Speaker 1>This is it.</v>

395
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:19.531
<v Speaker 1>This is my,</v>

396
00:11:19.531 --> 00:11:21.060
<v Speaker 1>this is my closing statement.</v>

397
00:11:21.061 --> 00:11:21.750
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>

398
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:26.750
<v Speaker 1>I'll bet you that at least 70% of UFC fans have been or are a WWE fan at some</v>

399
00:11:27.721 --> 00:11:28.700
<v Speaker 1>point 70%.</v>

400
00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:32.810
<v Speaker 3>I love when people throw a statistic around where they have done zero research,</v>

401
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:34.160
<v Speaker 3>just a random number.</v>

402
00:11:34.161 --> 00:11:35.270
<v Speaker 3>I believe 70.</v>

403
00:11:35.271 --> 00:11:35.931
<v Speaker 3>I do it all the time,</v>

404
00:11:35.931 --> 00:11:36.580
<v Speaker 3>by the way.</v>

405
00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:36.840
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

406
00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:41.150
<v Speaker 3>I'm 70 and I bet 90% of no I did.</v>

407
00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.253
<v Speaker 3>They look,</v>

408
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:43.880
<v Speaker 3>it's not the God damn same.</v>

409
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:45.620
<v Speaker 3>One of them is real.</v>

410
00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:50.570
<v Speaker 3>One of them people that are battling for their life and the most difficult</v>

411
00:11:50.571 --> 00:11:52.040
<v Speaker 3>contest and all of sports.</v>

412
00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:57.220
<v Speaker 3>Another one is weird fucking jerk off thing that strange guys do when they sit</v>

413
00:11:58.151 --> 00:12:00.460
<v Speaker 3>in front of the TV and pretend they don't know it's fake.</v>

414
00:12:00.730 --> 00:12:01.370
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

415
00:12:01.370 --> 00:12:02.203
<v Speaker 3>10 payment.</v>

416
00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:02.471
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

417
00:12:02.471 --> 00:12:03.221
<v Speaker 3>I know it's fake.</v>

418
00:12:03.221 --> 00:12:04.330
<v Speaker 3>Everybody knows it's fake.</v>

419
00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.141
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to know.</v>

420
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:06.880
<v Speaker 3>You shut that part of your brain off when you watch it.</v>

421
00:12:06.881 --> 00:12:08.140
<v Speaker 3>You like like a lizard.</v>

422
00:12:08.141 --> 00:12:10.960
<v Speaker 3>They told me to take a full time writers job.</v>

423
00:12:10.961 --> 00:12:11.900
<v Speaker 3>I know it's fake.</v>

424
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:13.600
<v Speaker 3>Even even if you wrote it,</v>

425
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:16.180
<v Speaker 3>you would still be there while it happened.</v>

426
00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:18.040
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe</v>

427
00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:23.480
<v Speaker 2>he wrote his safety order taker.</v>

428
00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.110
<v Speaker 2>You would hope you would have your fucking script in your hand and you'd be</v>

429
00:12:27.111 --> 00:12:28.220
<v Speaker 2>jumping up and down,</v>

430
00:12:28.221 --> 00:12:29.360
<v Speaker 2>spinning around in circles.</v>

431
00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:33.560
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe prompt the undertaker.</v>

432
00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:34.171
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

433

434
00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:40.881
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

435
00:12:40.881 --> 00:12:41.720
<v Speaker 2>He never got to finish.</v>

436
00:12:41.721 --> 00:12:44.420
<v Speaker 2>So I wrote a thing to where Cain,</v>

437
00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:49.690
<v Speaker 1>the undertakers brother wrestled Brock Lesnar at this wrestlemania coming up in</v>

438
00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:52.190
<v Speaker 1>seven months or so and uh,</v>

439
00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:55.400
<v Speaker 1>loses but undertaker comes back.</v>

440
00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:58.100
<v Speaker 1>Tombstone pal drives Brock Lesnar and they walk off together.</v>

441
00:12:58.140 --> 00:12:59.660
<v Speaker 1>Amazing Swan Song.</v>

442
00:12:59.661 --> 00:13:00.310
<v Speaker 1>They wake up.</v>

443
00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:01.143
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

444
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.100
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

445
00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.860
<v Speaker 3>when you come up with a move for a guy to win with,</v>

446
00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:07.190
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

447
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:11.270
<v Speaker 3>Do you take into consideration at all the health of the person tried to attempt</v>

448
00:13:11.271 --> 00:13:11.690
<v Speaker 3>that move?</v>

449
00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:12.380
<v Speaker 3>It's tough.</v>

450
00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:12.980
<v Speaker 3>You're right.</v>

451
00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:13.251
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

452
00:13:13.251 --> 00:13:16.610
<v Speaker 3>It's tough because when Brock Lesnar did that shooting star press flipped</v>

453
00:13:16.611 --> 00:13:17.840
<v Speaker 3>through the air and landed on his head.</v>

454
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:18.680
<v Speaker 3>I've seen that.</v>

455
00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:19.070
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

456
00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:19.551
<v Speaker 3>I've seen that.</v>

457
00:13:19.551 --> 00:13:23.900
<v Speaker 3>Everybody see anybody like who knew about Brock Lesnar who was researching him.</v>

458
00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:28.040
<v Speaker 3>Very likely if you were going through like internet videos and stuff like that,</v>

459
00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:31.220
<v Speaker 3>you would run into that video of him flipping off the top rope and landing on</v>

460
00:13:31.221 --> 00:13:36.221
<v Speaker 3>his head off 300 pounds of them landed on his head bang and kept going.</v>

461
00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

462
00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:39.013
<v Speaker 3>Crazy.</v>

463
00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:40.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how the fuck he lived.</v>

464
00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:41.630
<v Speaker 3>I know if you watched that,</v>

465
00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:42.860
<v Speaker 3>it looks like he's a dead man.</v>

466
00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:43.783
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

467
00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:45.100
<v Speaker 1>Wayne's on his fucking head.</v>

468
00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:45.850
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

469
00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:47.710
<v Speaker 1>There's some stuff that just can't even,</v>

470
00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.910
<v Speaker 1>they just probably an inch either way and he's,</v>

471
00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.040
<v Speaker 1>he can't move his legs and stuff,</v>

472
00:13:54.041 --> 00:13:55.030
<v Speaker 1>but he survived it.</v>

473
00:13:55.380 --> 00:14:00.280
<v Speaker 1>Walk in music is so powerful because you could psych out an opponent with</v>

474
00:14:00.281 --> 00:14:02.590
<v Speaker 1>walking music if it's done properly.</v>

475
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:03.330
<v Speaker 1>If it's some,</v>

476
00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:06.490
<v Speaker 1>if it's some subtle crazy stuff,</v>

477
00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:07.240
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

478
00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:07.451
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

479
00:14:07.451 --> 00:14:08.284
<v Speaker 1>you can't.</v>

480
00:14:08.510 --> 00:14:09.343
<v Speaker 1>Little bit.</v>

481
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:11.480
<v Speaker 2>He can wrestling.</v>

482
00:14:11.690 --> 00:14:13.800
<v Speaker 2>You look around what is trembling?</v>

483
00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:14.653
<v Speaker 2>He's playing that.</v>

484
00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:15.111
<v Speaker 2>Who's that?</v>

485
00:14:15.111 --> 00:14:15.831
<v Speaker 2>Phil Collins.</v>

486
00:14:15.831 --> 00:14:17.030
<v Speaker 2>I can feel it in here.</v>

487
00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:20.601
<v Speaker 2>You think?</v>

488
00:14:20.601 --> 00:14:22.220
<v Speaker 2>I believe this is my song.</v>

489
00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:25.210
<v Speaker 1>I think if you're on,</v>

490
00:14:25.211 --> 00:14:27.850
<v Speaker 1>if you're fighting in the UFC and you come out first,</v>

491
00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:28.870
<v Speaker 1>you add your song.</v>

492
00:14:28.871 --> 00:14:33.871
<v Speaker 1>Let's say your songs like a seven on a one to 10 and then lights go out and Phil</v>

493
00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:36.970
<v Speaker 1>Collins in the air tonight does come in.</v>

494
00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:37.990
<v Speaker 1>You're not a little bit like,</v>

495
00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:38.561
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

496
00:14:38.561 --> 00:14:40.300
<v Speaker 1>I wish I would've picked this guy.</v>

497
00:14:40.301 --> 00:14:40.750
<v Speaker 1>He's already got,</v>

498
00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:42.190
<v Speaker 1>he's already got one on me.</v>

499
00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.480
<v Speaker 1>It's already willing to one below,</v>

500
00:14:43.481 --> 00:14:44.350
<v Speaker 1>and that's the intro</v>

501
00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:48.873
<v Speaker 2>you</v>

502
00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:52.880
<v Speaker 2>need to call McMahon right now.</v>

503
00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:56.240
<v Speaker 2>You think like a fucking pro wrestling fan.</v>

504
00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:58.220
<v Speaker 2>And I say that with all due respect,</v>

505
00:14:58.760 --> 00:14:59.151
<v Speaker 2>I'm not,</v>

506
00:14:59.151 --> 00:15:00.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm not hating on it.</v>

507
00:15:00.051 --> 00:15:01.430
<v Speaker 2>But you think like you,</v>

508
00:15:01.431 --> 00:15:03.710
<v Speaker 2>you take the joy moment in that stupidity.</v>

509
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:06.350
<v Speaker 2>It's entertaining as hell.</v>

510
00:15:06.351 --> 00:15:07.130
<v Speaker 2>Vince,</v>

511
00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:08.600
<v Speaker 2>why are you slipping?</v>

512
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:09.920
<v Speaker 2>This is the management.</v>

513
00:15:09.921 --> 00:15:14.360
<v Speaker 2>Turn your organization around your them and they should call you the mastermind</v>

514
00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:16.730
<v Speaker 2>and they should make you a character as well.</v>

515
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:17.670
<v Speaker 2>I agree with you.</v>

516
00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:19.820
<v Speaker 2>Where those gold wrestling shoes,</v>

517
00:15:19.850 --> 00:15:20.870
<v Speaker 2>that's your whole outfit.</v>

518
00:15:20.871 --> 00:15:23.930
<v Speaker 2>It's shiny gold and the mastermind.</v>

519
00:15:23.931 --> 00:15:26.390
<v Speaker 2>Good to be here in Vancouver.</v>

520
00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:28.191
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

521
00:15:28.191 --> 00:15:28.881
<v Speaker 2>what's wrong?</v>

522
00:15:28.881 --> 00:15:31.370
<v Speaker 2>You don't like my plans for the future?</v>

523
00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:34.250
<v Speaker 2>I can feed it.</v>

524
00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:39.440
<v Speaker 2>What is it about all that stuff?</v>

525
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:41.800
<v Speaker 2>Even though you know it's total 100% horseshit.</v>

526
00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:43.850
<v Speaker 2>What is it about that stuff that's appealing to you?</v>

527
00:15:44.120 --> 00:15:45.200
<v Speaker 2>The Entertainment Gel.</v>

528
00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:47.150
<v Speaker 2>If you watched one of these things,</v>

529
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:47.870
<v Speaker 2>you would,</v>

530
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:52.480
<v Speaker 2>you would see what you liked about it and you would have a few favorites and no,</v>

531
00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:53.090
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

532
00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:54.320
<v Speaker 2>I'll go fucking crazy.</v>

533
00:15:54.321 --> 00:15:57.650
<v Speaker 2>And I'd watched lions killing gazelles on television because that's real.</v>

534
00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:58.401
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'd do.</v>

535
00:15:58.401 --> 00:15:59.780
<v Speaker 2>I'd grab my laptop and I'd be like,</v>

536
00:15:59.781 --> 00:15:59.901
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

537
00:15:59.901 --> 00:16:01.280
<v Speaker 2>you watch this fake shit all day.</v>

538
00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:02.173
<v Speaker 2>I need real.</v>

539
00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:03.050
<v Speaker 2>I need real.</v>

540
00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:05.060
<v Speaker 2>I can't get entertained by frank.</v>

541
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:07.370
<v Speaker 2>But that's what TV shows and movies are there.</v>

542
00:16:07.371 --> 00:16:08.204
<v Speaker 2>Fake.</v>

543
00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.230
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

544
00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:09.471
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

545
00:16:09.471 --> 00:16:09.861
<v Speaker 2>they're not.</v>

546
00:16:09.861 --> 00:16:11.840
<v Speaker 2>Fake sports are real.</v>

547
00:16:11.900 --> 00:16:13.340
<v Speaker 2>And that I understand,</v>

548
00:16:13.341 --> 00:16:15.080
<v Speaker 2>and this is sports entertainment.</v>

549
00:16:15.081 --> 00:16:15.914
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

550
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:16.490
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

551
00:16:16.490 --> 00:16:16.880
<v Speaker 2>We're not.</v>

552
00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.660
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's saying it's really when you watch game of Thrones and you watch a guy</v>

553
00:16:20.661 --> 00:16:21.710
<v Speaker 2>gets his head cut off,</v>

554
00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:22.940
<v Speaker 2>you know what it looks like.</v>

555
00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:23.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

556
00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.940
<v Speaker 2>It looks like a guy actually getting his head cut off.</v>

557
00:16:25.941 --> 00:16:26.810
<v Speaker 2>It looks real.</v>

558
00:16:27.170 --> 00:16:30.470
<v Speaker 2>When I watch wrestling and I see a guy get hit and go</v>

559
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:33.320
<v Speaker 2>turn to the crowd.</v>

560
00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:36.080
<v Speaker 2>I know that's bullshit.</v>

561
00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:38.480
<v Speaker 2>It's offensive to me.</v>

562
00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:40.190
<v Speaker 2>It's offensive.</v>

563
00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:41.053
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

564
00:16:41.230 --> 00:16:44.120
<v Speaker 2>And the idea is other moves that happen that are amazing.</v>

565
00:16:44.121 --> 00:16:44.420
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

566
00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:44.690
<v Speaker 2>Nope,</v>

567
00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:45.470
<v Speaker 2>nope.</v>

568
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:46.310
<v Speaker 2>They're all offensive.</v>

569
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:47.370
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

570
00:16:47.371 --> 00:16:49.730
<v Speaker 2>I know they take athleticism to pull off,</v>

571
00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.340
<v Speaker 2>but they're offensive because I'm so aware.</v>

572
00:16:52.370 --> 00:16:54.710
<v Speaker 2>It's so in my face and this is not really happening.</v>

573
00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.770
<v Speaker 2>I can't be the guy in the gold suit holding onto the script,</v>

574
00:16:58.010 --> 00:17:01.810
<v Speaker 2>jumping around and place going or lost.</v>

575
00:17:02.030 --> 00:17:04.610
<v Speaker 2>The streak has been broken.</v>

576
00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:05.901
<v Speaker 2>That's what you would do.</v>

577
00:17:05.901 --> 00:17:07.340
<v Speaker 2>You would freak the fuck out.</v>

578
00:17:07.350 --> 00:17:08.330
<v Speaker 2>I would run around.</v>

579
00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:09.343
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't do that.</v>

580
00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.280
<v Speaker 2>You would if you were hired.</v>

581
00:17:10.281 --> 00:17:11.960
<v Speaker 2>If I had a gold suit I would do that,</v>

582

731
00:21:21.171 --> 00:21:22.640
<v Speaker 1>Tony could gave me to like pro wrestling.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that would interest you or is he too much real?</v>

742
00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:34.470

746
00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:35.220
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

747
00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:35.740

<v Speaker 2>Last.</v>

749
00:21:38.030 --> 00:21:40.670
<v Speaker 2>That's the last thing you want to show me.</v>

750
00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.680
<v Speaker 2>Don't that'll get me angry.</v>

<v Speaker 2>He can get out of there.</v>

757
00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:51.890
<v Speaker 2>Nothing drives me crazier than like a fake submission move in a movie.</v>

758
00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.630
<v Speaker 2>That shit drives me nuts.</v>

759
00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:53.901
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

760
00:21:53.901 --> 00:21:58.040
<v Speaker 2>I stopped watching Dexter because fucking,</v>

761
00:21:58.250 --> 00:21:59.450
<v Speaker 2>what's his name from third rock?</v>

762
00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:00.470
<v Speaker 2>John Lithgow.</v>

763
00:22:00.650 --> 00:22:03.550
<v Speaker 2>John Lithgo have this chicken of her naked choke in a bathtub.</v>

764
00:22:03.610 --> 00:22:04.091
<v Speaker 2>And He,</v>

765
00:22:04.091 --> 00:22:05.210
<v Speaker 2>and he killed her that way.</v>

766
00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:05.900
<v Speaker 2>And I was like,</v>

767
00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:06.501

769
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:10.670
<v Speaker 2>That's so fake.</v>

770
00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:11.810
<v Speaker 2>She's not even red.</v>

771
00:22:12.290 --> 00:22:12.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm done.</v>

772
00:22:12.950 --> 00:22:13.790
<v Speaker 2>And I shut it off.</v>

773
00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:16.670
<v Speaker 2>I walked out of the room and discussed and I never watched another episode of</v>

774
00:22:16.671 --> 00:22:17.540
<v Speaker 2>Dexter again.</v>

775
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:18.463
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

776
00:22:18.740 --> 00:22:19.071
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

777
00:22:19.071 --> 00:22:21.320
<v Speaker 2>You can't show me a fake rear naked choke.</v>

778
00:22:21.321 --> 00:22:22.780
<v Speaker 2>You fucks that.</v>

779
00:22:22.850 --> 00:22:23.990
<v Speaker 2>That makes me angry.</v>

780
00:22:24.200 --> 00:22:27.590
<v Speaker 2>That's like if you were watching a Jimi Hendrix bio pick,</v>

781
00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:28.840
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

783
00:22:29.241 --> 00:22:30.290
<v Speaker 2>a non bio pic,</v>

784
00:22:30.291 --> 00:22:30.621
<v Speaker 2>but like,</v>

787
00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.490
<v Speaker 2>like an actor plays Jimmy Hendrix.</v>

788
00:22:34.491 --> 00:22:35.480
<v Speaker 2>I guess that's a biopic,</v>

789
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

790
00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:36.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

791
00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:38.330
<v Speaker 2>And some do didn't know how to play guitar and he's like,</v>

792
00:22:38.331 --> 00:22:40.150
<v Speaker 2>can around here own right.</v>

793
00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:41.121
<v Speaker 2>And he'd be like,</v>

794
00:22:41.121 --> 00:22:41.511

00:22:41.511 --> 00:22:42.620
<v Speaker 2>y'all got killing it.</v>

796
00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:43.700
<v Speaker 2>You're not doing it at all.</v>

797
00:22:43.701 --> 00:22:44.870
<v Speaker 2>You're not playing guitar.</v>

798
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:46.640
<v Speaker 2>That's what John Lithgow,</v>

799
00:22:46.641 --> 00:22:48.680
<v Speaker 2>it's Shitty fucking Renee get choked did for me.</v>

800
00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:53.300
<v Speaker 4>The only reason I think that you would maybe like it in the future is that you</v>

801
00:22:53.301 --> 00:22:54.020
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

802
00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:54.591
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

803
00:22:54.591 --> 00:22:59.300
<v Speaker 4>UFC so much in MMA and Jujitsu so much and Tony gets it together with a bunch of</v>

804
00:22:59.301 --> 00:23:00.350
<v Speaker 4>people and watches it.</v>

805
00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:03.660
<v Speaker 4>A lot of them watch it as a joke where Tony I think takes it a little bit too</v>

806
00:23:03.661 --> 00:23:04.440
<v Speaker 4>serious.</v>

807
00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.151
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>

808
00:23:05.151 --> 00:23:06.560
<v Speaker 1>we all watched it as a joke.</v>

809
00:23:06.561 --> 00:23:07.394
<v Speaker 1>I can,</v>

810
00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:08.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm not buying a joke.</v>

811
00:23:08.810 --> 00:23:11.870
<v Speaker 1>I just see and recognize what's entertaining about it.</v>

812
00:23:11.871 --> 00:23:16.700
<v Speaker 1>And I do like the ideology of stunning in arena of people.</v>

813
00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.420
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes that happens.</v>

814
00:23:19.530 --> 00:23:20.363
<v Speaker 2>It can happen.</v>

815
00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:25.700
<v Speaker 2>You have to look at the reaction to that is the three hour like job interview</v>

816
00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:27.983
<v Speaker 2>for you.</v>

817
00:23:28.050 --> 00:23:29.550
<v Speaker 2>This is like your audition tape.</v>

818
00:23:29.970 --> 00:23:31.440
<v Speaker 2>They should fucking hire you.</v>

819
00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:33.660
<v Speaker 2>They should figure out how they can,</v>

820
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:35.520
<v Speaker 2>I need you to pull this up.</v>

821
00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.040
<v Speaker 2>Where are you binge listen,</v>

822
00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:40.620

823
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:42.100
<v Speaker 2>You're crazy not to.</v>

824
00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:45.560
<v Speaker 1>You should have seen the looks on these people's faces when Brock beat the</v>

825
00:23:45.561 --> 00:23:46.100
<v Speaker 1>undertaker.</v>

826
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:46.441
<v Speaker 1>Nobody.</v>

827
00:23:46.441 --> 00:23:46.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

828
00:23:46.570 --> 00:23:47.740
<v Speaker 2>Thought it was going to happen.</v>

829
00:23:47.890 --> 00:23:48.701
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

830
00:23:48.701 --> 00:23:49.331
<v Speaker 2>What did they do,</v>

831
00:23:49.331 --> 00:23:50.080
<v Speaker 2>Tony?</v>

832
00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:55.080
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if on Saturday the fuck is wrong with you and that nobody thought it was</v>

833
00:23:55.241 --> 00:23:55.930
<v Speaker 2>going to happen.</v>

834
00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:57.040
<v Speaker 2>It was amazing.</v>

835
00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:58.660
<v Speaker 2>It was fake as fuck dude.</v>

836
00:23:59.110 --> 00:24:01.690
<v Speaker 2>But nobody thought it was going to happen.</v>

837
00:24:01.691 --> 00:24:04.330
<v Speaker 2>A lot of things are fake that nobody thought was going to happen.</v>

838
00:24:04.510 --> 00:24:05.343
<v Speaker 2>Tony,</v>

839
00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:06.120
<v Speaker 2>Tony,</v>

840
00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:06.411
<v Speaker 2>Tony,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>

842
00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:08.070
<v Speaker 2>Imagine if that guy</v>

843
00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:12.670
<v Speaker 1>who filled in for that Shit's getting around on Saturday and he took on</v>

844

845
00:24:17.921 --> 00:24:18.850
<v Speaker 1>Dillashaw beat him.</v>

846
00:24:18.851 --> 00:24:19.990
<v Speaker 1>The place would have been.</v>

847
00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:20.291
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

848

850
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:26.080

851
00:24:26.081 --> 00:24:28.720
<v Speaker 1>that would have been stunning and everybody would have known that they just</v>

<v Speaker 1>witnessed history</v>

<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you why there's millions and millions of WWF and I'm telling you</v>

874
00:25:02.591 --> 00:25:03.130
<v Speaker 2>why.</v>

875
00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:06.850
<v Speaker 2>Maybe hunters Thompson was just a couple of decades off when he was predicting</v>

876
00:25:06.851 --> 00:25:07.684
<v Speaker 2>the end of the world.</v>

877
00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:09.590
<v Speaker 1>Those guys,</v>

878
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:10.960
<v Speaker 1>they mean it's not easy.</v>

879
00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:11.201
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

880
00:25:11.201 --> 00:25:11.861
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

881
00:25:11.861 --> 00:25:16.630
<v Speaker 1>Brock was furious when Vince told him that he wanted him to beat the undertaker</v>

882
00:25:16.631 --> 00:25:17.021
<v Speaker 1>that day.</v>

883
00:25:17.021 --> 00:25:18.000
<v Speaker 1>Like in real life.</v>

884
00:25:18.001 --> 00:25:18.330
<v Speaker 1>Like okay,</v>

885
00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:19.021
<v Speaker 2>Betty was,</v>

886
00:25:19.021 --> 00:25:20.250
<v Speaker 2>and you were there to see it.</v>

887
00:25:20.550 --> 00:25:20.821
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

888
00:25:20.821 --> 00:25:22.320
<v Speaker 2>but I talked to somebody who was,</v>

889
00:25:22.350 --> 00:25:22.591
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

890
00:25:22.591 --> 00:25:24.030
<v Speaker 2>I bet he was honest with you.</v>

891
00:25:24.210 --> 00:25:25.800
<v Speaker 2>It's not like they lie all day.</v>

892
00:25:25.801 --> 00:25:26.634
<v Speaker 2>Every day.</v>

893
00:25:26.780 --> 00:25:27.100
<v Speaker 2>Tony,</v>

894
00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:28.380
<v Speaker 2>Tony's going to talk to some people.</v>

895
00:25:28.381 --> 00:25:29.080
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you a little,</v>

896
00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:31.320
<v Speaker 2>tell you what Brock was actually mad.</v>

897
00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:33.030
<v Speaker 2>He was really mad.</v>

898
00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.580
<v Speaker 2>He read the script and you just start doses.</v>

899
00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:36.483
<v Speaker 2>Bullshit.</v>

900
00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:38.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm not picking a fucking hundred taker of the,</v>

901
00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:40.140
<v Speaker 2>some of the guys that work,</v>

902
00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:44.660
<v Speaker 1>unlike the technical side for the UFC work for the WWE,</v>

903
00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:45.430
<v Speaker 2>art,</v>

904
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:46.263
<v Speaker 2>Brock was crying.</v>

905
00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:51.080
<v Speaker 2>That's what I heard was Brock went into the hospital with the undertaker,</v>

906
00:25:51.290 --> 00:25:52.021
<v Speaker 2>cried so hard.</v>

907
00:25:52.021 --> 00:25:53.050
<v Speaker 2>He dehydrated himself.</v>

908
00:25:53.051 --> 00:25:54.020
<v Speaker 2>After that match.</v>

909
00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:55.770
<v Speaker 2>They had to give them an IV to replenish.</v>

910
00:25:55.771 --> 00:25:57.860
<v Speaker 2>His team thought he killed the undertaker.</v>

911
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.461
<v Speaker 2>From that.</v>

912
00:25:58.461 --> 00:26:00.980
<v Speaker 2>Concussion is bad.</v>

913
00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:02.810
<v Speaker 2>Bad.</v>

914
00:26:02.810 --> 00:26:03.441
<v Speaker 2>It was real.</v>

915
00:26:03.441 --> 00:26:04.670
<v Speaker 2>The concussions are real.</v>

916
00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:06.620
<v Speaker 2>You can't buy that.</v>

917
00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:07.521
<v Speaker 2>I don't even buy.</v>

918
00:26:07.521 --> 00:26:08.354
<v Speaker 2>It was a real concussion.</v>

919
00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:09.770
<v Speaker 2>I probably faked a concussion</v>

920
00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:12.520
<v Speaker 2>then got JT on.</v>

921
00:26:12.521 --> 00:26:14.060
<v Speaker 2>Don't take her to the hospital.</v>

922
00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:16.310
<v Speaker 2>He's got up Bobo and even on the,</v>

923

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:30.980
<v Speaker 2>Are you doing it on my four year old boy?</v>

929
00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:32.760
<v Speaker 2>It's like you're pitching something and four year olds.</v>

935
00:26:41.181 --> 00:26:42.080
<v Speaker 2>You don't need a bandaid.</v>

936
00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:42.211

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

967
00:27:37.441 --> 00:27:40.980
<v Speaker 2>fantasy football is at least based on fucking football,</v>

<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

969

<v Speaker 2>but nobody knows what's going to happen in real sports.</v>

972
00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.000
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that part of what makes it exciting?</v>

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:57.840
<v Speaker 2>You don't know what's going to happen.</v>

00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:06.460
<v Speaker 2>It's like a play plays.</v>

<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

1004

1020
00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.470
<v Speaker 3>That's the thing about the Internet,</v>

1021
00:29:03.471 --> 00:29:04.040
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1022
00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:05.750
<v Speaker 3>Here's a photo of you out there somewhere.</v>

1023
00:29:06.170 --> 00:29:10.130
<v Speaker 3>Someone's Photoshop to Dick in your mouth or you kissing ass or you doing</v>

1024
00:29:10.131 --> 00:29:12.150
<v Speaker 3>something ridiculous and over our Mustang.</v>

1025
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:14.630
<v Speaker 3>Why did he do that as a challenger?</v>

1026
00:29:15.020 --> 00:29:19.190
<v Speaker 3>Why did he do that while he pulled his pants down and made someone kisses ass on</v>

1027
00:29:19.191 --> 00:29:19.910
<v Speaker 3>TV?</v>

1028
00:29:19.910 --> 00:29:20.720
<v Speaker 3>Probably.</v>

1029
00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:21.980
<v Speaker 3>That sounds like something he would do,</v>

1030
00:29:22.010 --> 00:29:22.670
<v Speaker 3>but he did.</v>

1031
00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:23.330
<v Speaker 3>You know it.</v>

1032
00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:24.950
<v Speaker 3>Why are you pretending you didn't watch that one?</v>

1033
00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:26.480
<v Speaker 3>It spits back think it.</v>

1034
00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:29.480
<v Speaker 3>They think that was over like 1213 years ago.</v>

1035
00:29:29.481 --> 00:29:30.260
<v Speaker 3>Something like that.</v>

1036
00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:31.071
<v Speaker 3>You weren't there yet,</v>

1037
00:29:31.071 --> 00:29:31.640
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

1038
00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:31.840
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1039
00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:31.970
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1040
00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:32.570
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1041
00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:33.590
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember.</v>

1042
00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:34.873
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember.</v>

1043
00:29:34.970 --> 00:29:35.691
<v Speaker 3>I don't believe it.</v>

1044
00:29:35.691 --> 00:29:36.680
<v Speaker 3>I think you're being mocked.</v>

1045
00:29:36.681 --> 00:29:41.120
<v Speaker 3>That may have been during that period where once you guys kissed his ass,</v>

1046
00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:45.790
<v Speaker 1>fuck your brother.</v>

1047
00:29:45.791 --> 00:29:49.570
<v Speaker 1>Back yard wrestling kind of gauge how many people in the audience though.</v>

1048
00:29:49.660 --> 00:29:50.590
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

1049
00:29:50.710 --> 00:29:54.190
<v Speaker 1>Plus it's been winning the Monday night cable wars for over 20 years.</v>

1050
00:29:54.430 --> 00:29:55.750
<v Speaker 1>Think about that for a second.</v>

1051
00:29:56.410 --> 00:29:58.210
<v Speaker 1>Every Monday night at wins,</v>

1052
00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:00.940
<v Speaker 1>every single month they pulled TNA though.</v>

1053
00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.540
<v Speaker 1>They pulled TNA from a,</v>

1054
00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:04.031
<v Speaker 1>from a spike.</v>

1055
00:30:04.031 --> 00:30:04.870
<v Speaker 1>TV expenses.</v>

1056
00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:05.883
<v Speaker 1>Competition.</v>

1057
00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.440
<v Speaker 1>What's the problem with TNA?</v>

1058
00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:09.340
<v Speaker 1>Everything's terrible.</v>

1059
00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:10.960
<v Speaker 1>They're just completely,</v>

1060
00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:13.340
<v Speaker 1>it's not even in the same,</v>

1061
00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:14.440
<v Speaker 1>that's what it should be.</v>

1062
00:30:14.441 --> 00:30:14.860
<v Speaker 1>Bribed,</v>

1063
00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:15.580
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

1064
00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:17.590
<v Speaker 1>It's not even in the same ballpark.</v>

1065
00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:18.400
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

1066
00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:18.551
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1067
00:30:18.551 --> 00:30:21.040
<v Speaker 1>they used to have like a lot of MMA guys would do it.</v>

1068
00:30:21.070 --> 00:30:24.100
<v Speaker 1>Like King Mo was in TNA and rampages and TNA.</v>

1069
00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:24.880
<v Speaker 1>There's not good.</v>

1070
00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:25.450
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1071
00:30:25.450 --> 00:30:25.840
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1072
00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:26.560
<v Speaker 1>That's wrong with it.</v>

1073
00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:27.371
<v Speaker 1>Bad writing,</v>

1074
00:30:27.371 --> 00:30:28.204
<v Speaker 1>bad everything.</v>

1075
00:30:28.270 --> 00:30:29.081
<v Speaker 1>Could you go over there?</v>

1076
00:30:29.081 --> 00:30:29.650
<v Speaker 1>Maybe ma'am,</v>

1077
00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:30.060
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't.</v>

1078
00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:30.310
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1079
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:31.143
<v Speaker 1>I don't want it.</v>

1080
00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:34.360
<v Speaker 1>You don't turn down the WWE TNA.</v>

1081
00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:34.691
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

1082
00:30:34.691 --> 00:30:35.800
<v Speaker 1>you could be the fucking mogul.</v>

1083
00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.360
<v Speaker 1>What did they give you a piece of the action.</v>

1084
00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:38.620
<v Speaker 1>What is the DNA said?</v>

1085
00:30:38.621 --> 00:30:39.040
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

1086
00:30:39.040 --> 00:30:40.630
<v Speaker 1>we heard you on the Joe Rogan podcast.</v>

1087
00:30:40.631 --> 00:30:42.160
<v Speaker 1>We'd like the way you think about wrestling.</v>

1088
00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:45.910
<v Speaker 1>I think this organization has still has some life and we're willing to,</v>

1089
00:30:45.911 --> 00:30:46.390
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1090
00:30:46.390 --> 00:30:47.710
<v Speaker 1>willing to cut you in on this.</v>

1091
00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:49.360
<v Speaker 1>Give you 10% of the action.</v>

1092
00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:50.920
<v Speaker 1>I own 10% of TNA.</v>

1093
00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:54.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure 10% of the TNA wouldn't even get me what I would have made with</v>

1094
00:30:54.821 --> 00:30:55.631
<v Speaker 1>the WWE.</v>

1095
00:30:55.631 --> 00:30:56.830
<v Speaker 1>You son of a bitch.</v>

1096
00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:57.221
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1097
00:30:57.221 --> 00:30:58.900
<v Speaker 1>They just lost their TV deal.</v>

1098
00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:00.520
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a TV deal.</v>

1099
00:31:01.270 --> 00:31:01.511
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1100
00:31:01.511 --> 00:31:02.344
<v Speaker 1>they're done.</v>

1101
00:31:02.700 --> 00:31:04.690
<v Speaker 1>Then it's maybe it'll get picked up by like lifetime.</v>

1102
00:31:05.050 --> 00:31:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Vince Mcmahon beat Ted Turner.</v>

1103
00:31:07.690 --> 00:31:08.920
<v Speaker 1>What does Ted Turner and CNN,</v>

1104
00:31:09.100 --> 00:31:09.791
<v Speaker 1>CNN,</v>

1105
00:31:09.791 --> 00:31:10.331
<v Speaker 1>TNT,</v>

1106
00:31:10.331 --> 00:31:14.420
<v Speaker 1>TBS heat through Ted Turner at open checks that he would,</v>

1107
00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.720
<v Speaker 1>he would just sign any wrestler back and uh,</v>

1108
00:31:17.410 --> 00:31:19.600
<v Speaker 1>they were having wars on Monday nights.</v>

1109
00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:20.620
<v Speaker 1>They'd go against each other.</v>

1110
00:31:20.621 --> 00:31:25.621
<v Speaker 1>Vince WWE on the USA network and t and t had nitro and Ted Turner said,</v>

1111
00:31:26.891 --> 00:31:28.810
<v Speaker 1>whatever we need to do to beat Vince Mcmahon,</v>

1112
00:31:29.290 --> 00:31:30.910
<v Speaker 1>I will write the check to whoever.</v>

1113
00:31:30.911 --> 00:31:31.600
<v Speaker 1>So they offered,</v>

1114
00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:33.190
<v Speaker 1>they bought hall Kogan they bought all these,</v>

1115
00:31:33.191 --> 00:31:33.461
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

1116
00:31:33.461 --> 00:31:34.900
<v Speaker 1>he believes I was there.</v>

1117
00:31:34.990 --> 00:31:35.823
<v Speaker 1>I was in that room.</v>

1118
00:31:35.830 --> 00:31:35.981
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1119
00:31:35.981 --> 00:31:39.970
<v Speaker 1>I didn't say I was there and he was just willing to spend whatever it takes.</v>

1120
00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:41.530
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like a plot,</v>

1121
00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:43.780
<v Speaker 1>like a plot in lack of ways or two different,</v>

1122
00:31:43.900 --> 00:31:44.141
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1123
00:31:44.141 --> 00:31:44.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm taught,</v>

1124
00:31:44.530 --> 00:31:45.490
<v Speaker 1>this is where it's real.</v>

1125
00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:47.530
<v Speaker 1>Just parts real.</v>

1126
00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:48.251
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem.</v>

1127
00:31:48.251 --> 00:31:50.290
<v Speaker 1>You've cried wolf through this whole podcast.</v>

1128
00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:55.130
<v Speaker 1>I never said it was real nice about Santa Claus repeating that it's not real.</v>

1129
00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:58.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm agreeing with you and now you're trying to tell us that the boogie man is</v>

1130
00:31:58.691 --> 00:31:58.961
<v Speaker 1>real.</v>

1131
00:31:58.961 --> 00:31:59.794
<v Speaker 1>That's what you're doing</v>

1132
00:32:01.510 --> 00:32:02.680
<v Speaker 1>for wrestling.</v>

1133
00:32:02.681 --> 00:32:03.131
<v Speaker 1>So real.</v>

1134
00:32:03.131 --> 00:32:03.964
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

1135
00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:05.530
<v Speaker 1>it's going to write it.</v>

1136
00:32:05.890 --> 00:32:09.940
<v Speaker 1>How much did Ted Turner spend millions and millions to buy?</v>

1137
00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:10.240
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

1138
00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:13.000
<v Speaker 1>The guys that were already developed from the WWF,</v>

1139

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1153

<v Speaker 1>I turned it for like a year in a row.</v>

1154
00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:39.633
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:48.290
<v Speaker 1>The rest is history.</v>

1160
00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:48.861
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

1161
00:32:48.861 --> 00:32:49.550
<v Speaker 1>One move.</v>
