15
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.511
<v Speaker 1>brought to you by several things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one thing that we can promise 100 </v>

16
00:00:50.241 --> 00:00:55.241
<v Speaker 1>percent when we do commercials for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast is if we're going to support a </v>

17
00:00:55.461 --> 00:01:00.461
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we're going to have them as a </v>

18
00:01:00.461 --> 00:01:00.461
<v Speaker 1>sponsor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to be cool there.</v>

19
00:01:00.461 --> 00:01:01.190
<v Speaker 1>There has to have a good business model.</v>

20
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.190
<v Speaker 1>They have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to be something that makes </v>

21
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.190
<v Speaker 1>sense for us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

22
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.480
<v Speaker 1>that's one of the reasons we are </v>

23
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:14.320

<v Speaker 1>what we decided to do with kerosene </v>

24
00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.381
<v Speaker 1>games is to take a chance to endorse a </v>
<v Speaker 1>startup company that is making really </v>

00:01:17.571 --> 00:01:22.571

<v Speaker 3>what are,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

190
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.220
<v Speaker 3>what we all believe to be good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody has their own sort of level.</v>

191
00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:38.390
<v Speaker 3>Dr Lazar,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the way,</v>

192
00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:43.940
<v Speaker 3>I think it's bizarre.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dr Azar as the neurosurgeon is talking </v>

193
00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:44.630
<v Speaker 3>about the benefits of taking Alpha </v>
<v Speaker 3>brain.</v>

194
00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.410
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're,</v>

195
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:49.160
<v Speaker 3>we're currently rubbing running this </v>
<v Speaker 3>double blind placebo,</v>

196
00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:50.590
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>experiment.</v>

197
00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:54.900
<v Speaker 2>You guys had been there for two years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is they have to take it.</v>

198
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.890
<v Speaker 2>They take it for a year,</v>

199
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.620
<v Speaker 1>which it sounds crazy and it costs a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of fucking money.</v>

200
00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:01.150
<v Speaker 1>But what's important is if you go to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>site,</v>

201
00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:06.180
<v Speaker 1>there's a science page on [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>dot com explains all the different </v>

202
00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:10.190
<v Speaker 1>ingredients that have been shown in </v>
<v Speaker 1>clinical trials to improve memory to,</v>

203
00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:15.820
<v Speaker 1>to the idea is that they improve </v>
<v Speaker 1>cognitive function by providing your </v>

204
00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:20.451
<v Speaker 1>neurotransmitters with all the building </v>
<v Speaker 1>blocks and the nutrients that it needs </v>

205
00:09:20.451 --> 00:09:21.450
<v Speaker 1>in order to think the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a,</v>

206
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:26.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm a huge believer of talked about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the podcast and lean times and I've </v>

207
00:09:26.590 --> 00:09:28.770
<v Speaker 1>talked to a lot of people after shows </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they've told me how much it's helped</v>

208
00:09:28.771 --> 00:09:33.771
<v Speaker 1>them and how much it inspired them </v>
<v Speaker 1>because I'm a big believer in it sounds </v>

209
00:09:33.771 --> 00:09:37.911
<v Speaker 1>so obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm a big believer in putting </v>

210
00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:40.071
<v Speaker 1>healthy shit into your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean occasionally enjoy a cocktail or </v>

211
00:09:40.071 --> 00:09:41.880
<v Speaker 1>two or a fucking steak and cheese sub or</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

212
00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:44.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm not a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a saint when it comes to that,</v>

213
00:09:44.341 --> 00:09:49.341
<v Speaker 1>but I do eat a lot of nutritious food </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think it's really important for </v>

214
00:09:49.341 --> 00:09:49.341
<v Speaker 1>you to do the same.</v>

215
00:09:49.341 --> 00:09:52.680
<v Speaker 1>If you want your body to really work at </v>
<v Speaker 1>an optimum level,</v>

216
00:09:52.681 --> 00:09:57.681
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only way to do it is to feed it </v>

217
00:09:57.681 --> 00:10:01.790
<v Speaker 1>nutrient rich foods like vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kale and a lot of green vegetables,</v>

218
00:10:03.661 --> 00:10:06.000
<v Speaker 1>drink a lot of fucking water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't just drink a little bit,</v>

219
00:10:06.001 --> 00:10:08.370
<v Speaker 1>drink a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take multivitamins,</v>

220
00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:13.460
<v Speaker 1>and there's other supplements that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can take that will have a positive </v>

221
00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:14.360
<v Speaker 1>effect on the way your body functions </v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

222
00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.740
<v Speaker 1>and to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what it's all about.</v>

223
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:22.070
<v Speaker 1>I ain't mad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm all about my brain functioning on </v>

224
00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:22.070
<v Speaker 1>the highest level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can get it to my body,</v>

225
00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:27.021
<v Speaker 1>functioning at the highest level I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>get it to and that's what we're all </v>

226
00:10:27.021 --> 00:10:28.890
<v Speaker 1>about it on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything that we sell is either trying</v>

<v Speaker 1>we'll try to sell that to.</v>

235
00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:00.800
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I when you search Alex Jones on on it,</v>

236
00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:01.760
<v Speaker 2>like I just tried to search</v>

237
00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:04.740
<v Speaker 4>Joan's going to become a representative </v>
<v Speaker 4>of audit.</v>

238
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:07.950
<v Speaker 4>Finding a new world order with vitamins.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is He really?</v>

239
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:11.850
<v Speaker 4>The government doesn't want you to have </v>
<v Speaker 4>vitamins because the elites are the only</v>

240
00:11:11.851 --> 00:11:13.260
<v Speaker 4>ones who want to have a good memory</v>

241
00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:16.500
<v Speaker 2>and it could laser not find his </v>
<v Speaker 2>name.com.</v>

242
00:11:16.501 --> 00:11:20.760
<v Speaker 2>So he had to run a laser but it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>already taken.</v>

243
00:11:20.761 --> 00:11:23.310
<v Speaker 2>So He'd got the [inaudible] with a z </v>
<v Speaker 2>just like that.</v>

244
00:11:23.311 --> 00:11:24.850
<v Speaker 2>Other kiddies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Good</v>

245
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:29.870
<v Speaker 1>move if Dr Lazaro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like a famous character and </v>

246
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:32.891
<v Speaker 1>like a Batman comic book or something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that to change your name to Dr </v>

247
00:11:32.891 --> 00:11:32.891
<v Speaker 1>Lazaro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There'll be kind of clutch.</v>

248
00:11:32.891 --> 00:11:35.900
<v Speaker 1>But the only other Lasar that I've ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>heard of is that guy,</v>

249
00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:40.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the man who claimed to be an </v>

250
00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:41.450
<v Speaker 1>area 51.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever heard of him?</v>

251
00:11:41.451 --> 00:11:45.110
<v Speaker 1>Robert Lasar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bob was our and he's the guy who claimed</v>

252
00:11:45.111 --> 00:11:50.111
<v Speaker 1>to be a man who was hired to back </v>
<v Speaker 1>engineer Ufos and area 51 and it was </v>

253
00:11:51.861 --> 00:11:56.861
<v Speaker 1>proven that he's at least full of shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>about is education of the Stanton </v>

254
00:11:56.861 --> 00:11:56.890
<v Speaker 1>Freedman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe,</v>

255
00:11:56.891 --> 00:12:01.891
<v Speaker 1>who actually wants to do the podcast </v>
<v Speaker 1>when I get him on who is the probably </v>

256
00:12:01.891 --> 00:12:05.791
<v Speaker 1>the leading guy when it comes to a Ufo </v>
<v Speaker 1>and flying saucers and what,</v>

257
00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:11.480
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the possibilities of space travel </v>

258
00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:13.831
<v Speaker 1>could be this guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But like I think he's like a nuclear </v>

259
00:12:13.831 --> 00:12:14.440
<v Speaker 1>physicist or something wacky and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>been studying this shit forever,</v>

260
00:12:14.441 --> 00:12:19.441
<v Speaker 1>but he absolutely believes that we've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been visited by ships from other </v>

261
00:12:19.451 --> 00:12:24.070
<v Speaker 1>galaxies and he says there's proof and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to get him on and we're also</v>

262
00:12:24.071 --> 00:12:29.071
<v Speaker 1>working to get Steven Greer on who's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy who's the head of the disclosure </v>

263

265
00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:37.450
<v Speaker 1>the disclosure project was like a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 1>of different fucking scientists and they</v>

266
00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:42.480
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 1>ufo experiences in,</v>

268
00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:47.970

<v Speaker 1>compelling to really interesting stuff.</v>

<v Speaker 5>You and you and I kind of lived those.</v>

347
00:16:21.390 --> 00:16:24.250
<v Speaker 5>That Boston Comedy Club was a fun spot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that still this?</v>

348
00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:25.620

<v Speaker 5>now.</v>

350
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:32.270
<v Speaker 5>But it used to be like an addict,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like a snow large,</v>

351
00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:37.540
<v Speaker 5>like a large,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like they kind of had a fireplace on </v>

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:37.820
<v Speaker 5>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a place.</v>

353

<v Speaker 5>people in there.</v>

358
00:16:51.950 --> 00:16:55.280

<v Speaker 5>another one.</v>

00:17:23.090 --> 00:17:27.110
<v Speaker 5>I don't understand how reggie mcfadden </v>
<v Speaker 5>isn't like Kevin Hart,</v>

372
00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:34.870
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I've seen crazy people make it </v>

373
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:35.030
<v Speaker 5>before so it's still a valid question.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

374
00:17:35.031 --> 00:17:38.180
<v Speaker 5>Crazy Safari.</v>

375

<v Speaker 5>like run time.</v>

376
00:17:41.601 --> 00:17:44.510

<v Speaker 5>He worked at.</v>

377
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:49.440
<v Speaker 5>He did a spot at a place in new Rochelle</v>
<v Speaker 5>called the champagne comedy club.</v>

378
00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.900
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't work there because I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>dirty.</v>

379
00:17:52.190 --> 00:17:57.190
<v Speaker 3>Dude did not allow any dirty comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing that you had to give you a </v>

380
00:17:57.190 --> 00:18:00.561
<v Speaker 3>speech before you worked there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He would say no motherfuckers who was </v>

381
00:18:00.561 --> 00:18:02.370
<v Speaker 3>real serious,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he put his finger up and he goes,</v>

382
00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:06.070
<v Speaker 3>you don't say the bitch had a big ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You say the woman had a while back.</v>

383
00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:08.770
<v Speaker 3>I'm not joking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He had,</v>

384
00:18:10.050 --> 00:18:15.050
<v Speaker 3>he had rules.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was the champagne comedy club </v>

385
00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:16.170
<v Speaker 3>and he was trying to make it very </v>
<v Speaker 3>upscale,</v>

386
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:18.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and some of my friend John,</v>

387
00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:21.270
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>open for Reggie and he had a respectable</v>

388
00:18:21.271 --> 00:18:22.140
<v Speaker 3>set,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

389
00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:27.330
<v Speaker 3>but Reggie without a swear with real was</v>
<v Speaker 3>no bad language too strong.</v>

390
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:31.170
<v Speaker 3>I mean he destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was watching him.</v>

391
00:18:31.171 --> 00:18:32.820
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm watching the next Eddie Murphy.</v>

392
00:18:32.821 --> 00:18:34.350
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy is going to be gigantic.</v>

393
00:18:34.351 --> 00:18:35.790
<v Speaker 3>You can't stop this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

394
00:18:35.791 --> 00:18:37.320
<v Speaker 3>this is the kind of talent you can't </v>
<v Speaker 3>stop.</v>

395
00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:39.070
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he was the one that,</v>

396
00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.860
<v Speaker 3>that what if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason,</v>

397
00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:45.890
<v Speaker 3>when you say the word regiment fat and </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a few comedy fans who know who </v>

398
00:18:45.890 --> 00:18:47.180
<v Speaker 3>he is or he's not.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not like Kevin Hart is or like,</v>

399
00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:52.220
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and no disrespect to Kevin Hart who I </v>

400
00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:52.220
<v Speaker 3>think it's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>

401
00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:52.220
<v Speaker 3>I'm using this as an example because </v>
<v Speaker 3>he's really good.</v>

402
00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:54.120
<v Speaker 7>Just trying to show people how funny.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Reggie.</v>

403
00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:57.140
<v Speaker 7>Reggie.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Fucking amazing.</v>

404
00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:00.470
<v Speaker 7>He would erase your performance.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Who would destroy?</v>

405
00:19:01.070 --> 00:19:02.420
<v Speaker 7>Who was the guy that went on?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

406
00:19:02.421 --> 00:19:03.610
<v Speaker 7>I just remember.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

407
00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:06.930
<v Speaker 3>he was so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like his whole animated on stage.</v>

408
00:19:07.470 --> 00:19:09.230
<v Speaker 7>Perfectly animated.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

409
00:19:09.231 --> 00:19:11.250
<v Speaker 7>There's one joke.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I keep telling people.</v>

410
00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:14.670
<v Speaker 7>I was in Amsterdam doing a short reggie </v>
<v Speaker 7>and uh,</v>

411
00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:16.740
<v Speaker 7>he went on,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he did this joke about,</v>

412
00:19:17.130 --> 00:19:18.180
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>when he was little,</v>

413
00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:20.960
<v Speaker 7>he had a cousin who was retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

414
00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:23.420
<v Speaker 7>And then one day he was in the basement </v>
<v Speaker 7>playing with his cousins.</v>

415
00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:23.820
<v Speaker 7>They,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

416
00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:28.840
<v Speaker 7>they came over and then the cousins </v>
<v Speaker 7>playing with him and a cousin like </v>

417
00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:32.620
<v Speaker 7>unstretched and I'm glad they're gone.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Shit.</v>

418
00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:35.250
<v Speaker 7>And it's Reggie is looking at it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>What the hell?</v>

419
00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:36.750
<v Speaker 7>You're not retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Nah Man,</v>

420
00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:41.610
<v Speaker 7>I just do that because it's just easier.</v>
<v Speaker 7>People take care of you.</v>

421
00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:45.330
<v Speaker 7>They feed you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't have to go to school or shit.</v>

422
00:19:45.331 --> 00:19:46.830
<v Speaker 7>They're coming backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I see you later.</v>

423
00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.280
<v Speaker 7>He goes back into being retired.</v>

424
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:58.630
<v Speaker 3>Reggie's new shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He used to have a bit that would just </v>

425
00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:02.630
<v Speaker 3>below the room apart and a bit was about</v>
<v Speaker 3>his experience at a club trying to pick </v>

426
00:20:04.051 --> 00:20:09.051
<v Speaker 3>up a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she had this really unattractive </v>

427
00:20:09.051 --> 00:20:09.960
<v Speaker 3>friend who is very persistent and he had</v>
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>

428
00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:13.210
<v Speaker 3>had to be wherever her friend was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He couldn't get the two of them away.</v>

429
00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:18.490
<v Speaker 3>It's a fucking the one at the end.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to give up the bed in case </v>

430
00:20:18.490 --> 00:20:20.160
<v Speaker 3>he's still doing it because it was just.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was so fucking.</v>

431
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:22.670
<v Speaker 3>There was a bit where the ugly girl </v>
<v Speaker 3>parts in.</v>

432
00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.810
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember when the other girl </v>
<v Speaker 3>would smash through the.</v>

433
00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.100
<v Speaker 3>You can just be crying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd be crying,</v>

434
00:20:29.101 --> 00:20:33.540
<v Speaker 3>laughing because he was so animated and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way they played the girl was like so</v>

435
00:20:33.541 --> 00:20:36.560
<v Speaker 3>like floppy and fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just you couldn't.</v>

436
00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:39.750
<v Speaker 3>You would just cry and laugh and he was </v>
<v Speaker 3>so confident too.</v>

437
00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:40.690
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

438
00:20:40.691 --> 00:20:42.790
<v Speaker 7>He had an ego like this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How funny.</v>

439
00:20:42.791 --> 00:20:44.380
<v Speaker 7>Reggie is like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I guess.</v>

440
00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:46.690
<v Speaker 7>I guess it's A.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't lie on funny,</v>

441
00:20:47.170 --> 00:20:49.630
<v Speaker 7>like when Reggie first started,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he was so cocky.</v>

442
00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:53.590
<v Speaker 7>I could not like Reggie,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I could not deny that he was funny.</v>

443
00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:55.210
<v Speaker 7>He thought he was talking.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Really?</v>

444
00:20:55.270 --> 00:20:57.300
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'd never had that experience with him.</v>

445
00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.170
<v Speaker 7>Now he's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>maybe it was just,</v>

446
00:20:59.171 --> 00:21:01.990
<v Speaker 7>maybe it was even part of my insecurity,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but he,</v>

447
00:21:02.110 --> 00:21:04.750
<v Speaker 7>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>me and reggie are good friends now,</v>

448
00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:09.900
<v Speaker 7>like later on,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I think it's a testament to how </v>

449
00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:10.950
<v Speaker 7>funny you are when I don't like you and </v>
<v Speaker 7>you're like,</v>

450
00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:16.230
<v Speaker 7>this dude is funny and I would never </v>
<v Speaker 7>walk out the room when I'm seeing </v>

451
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.230
<v Speaker 7>performance.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just watched that shit.</v>

452
00:21:16.230 --> 00:21:16.920
<v Speaker 7>Not Laugh.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

453
00:21:17.180 --> 00:21:19.870
<v Speaker 7>you're rolling ben over at a dude you </v>
<v Speaker 7>don't like.</v>

454
00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:22.810
<v Speaker 7>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's a funny motherfucker right there.</v>

455
00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:24.370
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no shit.</v>

456
00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:26.020
<v Speaker 3>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

457
00:21:26.021 --> 00:21:27.560
<v Speaker 3>I never.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I never had any issues with them.</v>

458
00:21:27.561 --> 00:21:28.960
<v Speaker 3>It was always nothing but friendly to </v>
<v Speaker 3>me.</v>

459
00:21:28.961 --> 00:21:33.961
<v Speaker 3>That's why I was shocked that he said he</v>
<v Speaker 3>had an ego because I thought he was a </v>

460
00:21:33.961 --> 00:21:34.990
<v Speaker 3>head like a real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like in my mind that perception was</v>

461
00:21:34.991 --> 00:21:37.030
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy's just got the full package.</v>

462
00:21:37.031 --> 00:21:42.031
<v Speaker 3>He's kind of all together.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's why like when you tell people </v>

463
00:21:42.031 --> 00:21:42.031
<v Speaker 3>about them and they don't know who he </v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

464
00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.200
<v Speaker 3>like how did that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't understand that</v>

465
00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:44.980
<v Speaker 7>it is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

466
00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:47.110
<v Speaker 7>it was kinda crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like how does that happen?</v>

467
00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:50.200
<v Speaker 3>Because when we were all coming up in </v>
<v Speaker 3>that time,</v>

468
00:21:50.201 --> 00:21:51.970
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in New York,</v>

469
00:21:52.090 --> 00:21:54.880
<v Speaker 3>he was one of the big guys just like </v>
<v Speaker 3>brewer,</v>

470
00:21:54.881 --> 00:21:58.380
<v Speaker 3>just like all the other guys towel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who everybody knows now,</v>

471
00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.820
<v Speaker 3>but you say Reggie Mcfadden and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know who he is.</v>

472
00:22:00.821 --> 00:22:04.660
<v Speaker 3>I would have never guessed that would </v>
<v Speaker 3>have happened based on how you and I saw</v>

473
00:22:04.661 --> 00:22:05.360
<v Speaker 3>him then</v>

474
00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:07.680
<v Speaker 7>like you could,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this is a funny game man.</v>

475
00:22:07.681 --> 00:22:09.900
<v Speaker 7>You could never tell you something.</v>

476
00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:12.020
<v Speaker 3>People just can't keep it together to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

477
00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:17.200
<v Speaker 3>the same thing that makes you funny also</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes you feel a little bit fucking </v>

478
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:17.200
<v Speaker 3>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

479
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:21.630
<v Speaker 3>And for some people they just did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Life just goes off the tracks and into </v>

480
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:24.561
<v Speaker 3>the woods and there's no one there to </v>
<v Speaker 3>manage it and bring it back on and go a </v>

481

<v Speaker 3>gambling.</v>

<v Speaker 3>let's just keep calm me down a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit,</v>

489
00:22:36.510 --> 00:22:37.620
<v Speaker 3>but for some folks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

490
00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:42.650
<v Speaker 3>they don't have a person like that in </v>
<v Speaker 3>their life that looks out for them and </v>

491
00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:43.850
<v Speaker 3>then they just go 100 percent cat </v>
<v Speaker 3>Williams on you and you know,</v>

492
00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:47.190
<v Speaker 3>you don't know what the fuck is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what's happening.</v>

493
00:22:47.191 --> 00:22:47.770
<v Speaker 3>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

494
00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:51.040
<v Speaker 3>how do you get a talented guy and allow </v>
<v Speaker 3>them to go off the rails like that?</v>

495
00:22:51.041 --> 00:22:56.041
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he needs someone in there to settle </v>

496
00:22:56.041 --> 00:22:56.041
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

497
00:22:56.041 --> 00:22:56.041
<v Speaker 3>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to be fine here.</v>

498
00:22:56.041 --> 00:22:58.720
<v Speaker 7>Last time I saw Reggie last few times,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I so reggie,</v>

499
00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:04.340
<v Speaker 7>you probably know this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but he was trying to get people to </v>

500
00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:07.971
<v Speaker 7>invest in a gold mine in Costa Rica.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Swear to God.</v>

501
00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:12.000
<v Speaker 7>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

502
00:23:12.001 --> 00:23:15.750
<v Speaker 7>I think it's gold.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Gold or copper mine in Costa Rica.</v>

503
00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:21.050
<v Speaker 7>And then it's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like we're in a profession where we're </v>

504
00:23:21.050 --> 00:23:21.180
<v Speaker 7>all taking a chance were in </v>
<v Speaker 7>entertainment lotto,</v>

505
00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:23.550
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>But to us hearing that,</v>

506
00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:26.640
<v Speaker 7>it makes him sound crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

507
00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:29.010
<v Speaker 7>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just saying that makes him sound crazy.</v>

508
00:23:29.011 --> 00:23:34.011
<v Speaker 7>But we're in a crazy business period </v>
<v Speaker 7>where we're all taking a chance like we </v>

509
00:23:34.011 --> 00:23:34.011
<v Speaker 7>are</v>

510
00:23:34.011 --> 00:23:35.810
<v Speaker 3>sort of.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I think at a certain point in time,</v>

511
00:23:35.811 --> 00:23:38.180
<v Speaker 3>don't you feel like you've developed an </v>
<v Speaker 3>audience.</v>

512
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:43.230
<v Speaker 3>The people know that if all you have to </v>
<v Speaker 3>do is keep being funny and keep writing </v>

513
00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:43.870
<v Speaker 3>jokes and you're not going anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People</v>

514
00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:48.870
<v Speaker 7>don't like in La,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like even the brand new comics,</v>

515
00:23:49.430 --> 00:23:53.900
<v Speaker 7>like they're in such a rush and then if </v>
<v Speaker 7>somebody gets one little thing,</v>

516
00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:58.980
<v Speaker 7>if it bothers him so much mentally,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like people can't handle not being </v>

517
00:23:59.151 --> 00:24:04.151
<v Speaker 7>famous right now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like my shit is taken like the slow </v>

518
00:24:04.151 --> 00:24:04.151
<v Speaker 7>cooking burn.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

519
00:24:04.151 --> 00:24:06.020
<v Speaker 7>But I'm just like a relaxed Jamaican </v>
<v Speaker 7>dude.</v>

520
00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:08.210
<v Speaker 7>This is normal pace for me.</v>

521
00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:10.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

522
00:24:10.530 --> 00:24:11.530
<v Speaker 1>famous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No fame,</v>

523
00:24:11.560 --> 00:24:16.560
<v Speaker 1>you're still a top notch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stand up comic and you could work </v>

524
00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:16.560
<v Speaker 1>anywhere you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

525
00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:21.271
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you are still very known in the </v>

526
00:24:21.271 --> 00:24:22.120
<v Speaker 1>standup world and so you could always </v>
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>

527
00:24:22.121 --> 00:24:25.280
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is once you become like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

528
00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:30.290
<v Speaker 1>you reach a certain level of proficiency</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't just about maintaining and about </v>

529
00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:32.050
<v Speaker 1>writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean you're already,</v>

530
00:24:32.051 --> 00:24:34.540
<v Speaker 1>you're already in a good groove.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can already make money doing it,</v>

531
00:24:34.541 --> 00:24:34.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the,</v>

532
00:24:34.971 --> 00:24:39.971
<v Speaker 1>the real chances are gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then the chances has to be just </v>

533
00:24:39.971 --> 00:24:39.971
<v Speaker 1>coming up with new material.</v>

534
00:24:39.971 --> 00:24:42.150
<v Speaker 7>But I think people would just want,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think,</v>

535
00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.470
<v Speaker 7>I think Reggie did have an ego.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He wanted superstar.</v>

536
00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:46.550
<v Speaker 7>He should have had it and he shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 7>have had.</v>

537
00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:47.910
<v Speaker 7>I don't know how he didn't have it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it's,</v>

538
00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:50.490
<v Speaker 7>I think people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>some people can't handle not having it.</v>

539
00:24:50.810 --> 00:24:51.710
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

540
00:24:51.711 --> 00:24:56.711
<v Speaker 1>I've been around people who act like I </v>
<v Speaker 1>stole something from them because I've </v>

541
00:24:56.900 --> 00:25:00.200
<v Speaker 1>know because I've been successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is ridiculous.</v>

542
00:25:00.201 --> 00:25:01.160
<v Speaker 1>They'll say we're shitty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

543
00:25:01.161 --> 00:25:06.161
<v Speaker 1>must be nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that the white sand.</v>

544
00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:08.360
<v Speaker 1>And so do you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not sincere.</v>

545
00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:11.840
<v Speaker 1>That's like a weird passive aggressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Douchey way saying it,</v>

546
00:25:12.530 --> 00:25:13.610
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

547
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:17.520
<v Speaker 7>which is fucked up because you turn </v>
<v Speaker 7>obtained like uh,</v>

548
00:25:17.521 --> 00:25:19.770
<v Speaker 7>a lot of success and you're still </v>
<v Speaker 7>working hard.</v>

549
00:25:19.771 --> 00:25:24.210
<v Speaker 7>Like what?</v>
<v Speaker 7>In like some building in woodland hills,</v>

550
00:25:24.211 --> 00:25:27.330
<v Speaker 7>like banging out a podcast,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know what I mean?</v>

551
00:25:27.331 --> 00:25:28.800
<v Speaker 7>You don't have to do this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

552
00:25:28.801 --> 00:25:29.670
<v Speaker 7>you do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 7>You have to know since of the program,</v>

554
00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:37.070
<v Speaker 7>but you're saying you're saying you do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You do.</v>

555
00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:39.970
<v Speaker 7>Are you saying you do?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is Good,</v>

556
00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.960
<v Speaker 7>like a good testament for you?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know what I'm saying?</v>

557
00:25:42.961 --> 00:25:44.640
<v Speaker 7>Like there's other people like fuck that</v>
<v Speaker 7>shit.</v>

558
00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:48.540
<v Speaker 7>Famous ain't doing nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Is there,</v>

559
00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:53.700
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like some people that ain't gonna work </v>

560
00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:53.700
<v Speaker 7>as hard as you are.</v>
<v Speaker 7>My point is your work.</v>

561
00:25:53.700 --> 00:25:57.590
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not that hard and it's not really </v>

562
00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:57.590
<v Speaker 1>work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See that's the whole beauty of it.</v>

563
00:25:57.590 --> 00:26:02.001
<v Speaker 1>Like it's a pleasure to come here and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sit down and have a conversation with a </v>

564
00:26:02.001 --> 00:26:02.001
<v Speaker 1>funny person,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

565
00:26:02.001 --> 00:26:04.380
<v Speaker 1>or an interesting person or scientist or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whoever the fuck it is.</v>

566
00:26:04.381 --> 00:26:06.270
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's not work.</v>

567
00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:11.540
<v Speaker 1>It just so happens that it's pays money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just figuring out a way to do </v>

568
00:26:11.641 --> 00:26:13.920
<v Speaker 1>something you actually like doing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then it just pays money.</v>

569
00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:15.790
<v Speaker 1>So then he'd be like an idiot not to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

570
00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:16.950
<v Speaker 1>Like why wouldn't you do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fun.</v>

571
00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:19.410
<v Speaker 1>Some people are too lazy to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they like.</v>

572
00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:21.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know what the difference between</v>

573
00:26:21.630 --> 00:26:26.630
<v Speaker 1>doing this and not doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just I'm doing something else for </v>

574
00:26:26.630 --> 00:26:27.420
<v Speaker 1>three hours and this is a fun thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do for three hours.</v>

575
00:26:27.660 --> 00:26:30.360
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hardly ever think of it as work.</v>

576
00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:32.040
<v Speaker 1>Well that's a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

577
00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:32.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

578
00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.280
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why you got to keep it going.</v>

579
00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:37.080
<v Speaker 1>You can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got to keep it going.</v>

580
00:26:37.081 --> 00:26:38.970
<v Speaker 1>So the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you always have like a comfort zone,</v>

581
00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:41.700
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you just completely lay back,</v>

582
00:26:41.701 --> 00:26:43.930
<v Speaker 1>then people forget you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like</v>

583
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.930
<v Speaker 5>you're doing a lot of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to Jujitsu,</v>

584
00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.480
<v Speaker 5>you got the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know the fights,</v>

585
00:26:48.481 --> 00:26:51.140
<v Speaker 5>you got the stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

586
00:26:51.270 --> 00:26:51.930
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

587
00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.780
<v Speaker 5>You don't combined them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No shows.</v>

588
00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:57.070
<v Speaker 5>I'll do like a show the night before the</v>
<v Speaker 5>UFC,</v>

589
00:26:57.350 --> 00:27:00.390
<v Speaker 5>like that's a lot like you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you keep it moving,</v>

590
00:27:00.391 --> 00:27:02.170
<v Speaker 5>but it doesn't feel like nothing to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if,</v>

591
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:05.340
<v Speaker 5>if you're on the outside looking in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're working a lot,</v>

592
00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:08.310
<v Speaker 5>but if you're listening,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you hustling.</v>

593
00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:08.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

594
00:27:08.911 --> 00:27:13.380
<v Speaker 5>But if you were doing what I was doing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's none of it's work like that at all.</v>

595
00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:16.890
<v Speaker 5>Like if I had to do something that I </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't enjoy doing and that was traveling</v>

596
00:27:16.891 --> 00:27:18.930
<v Speaker 5>as much as I do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really would not be happy.</v>

597
00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:21.390
<v Speaker 5>But it's like everywhere I'm going like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>

598
00:27:21.391 --> 00:27:22.830
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to go do some comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like Hey,</v>

599
00:27:22.831 --> 00:27:24.000
<v Speaker 5>I'm gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go see the fights,</v>

600
00:27:24.030 --> 00:27:24.410
<v Speaker 5>you know?</v>

601
00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:25.890
<v Speaker 5>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to me everything's fun.</v>

602
00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:31.040
<v Speaker 5>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>am I going to do a podcast with Dan </v>

603
00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:31.040
<v Speaker 5>Edwards?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's fun.</v>

604
00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:31.650
<v Speaker 5>It's all good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's nothing immediately.</v>

605
00:27:31.651 --> 00:27:34.020
<v Speaker 5>Even though you've got to discipline </v>
<v Speaker 5>yourself a little bit,</v>

606
00:27:34.050 --> 00:27:36.810
<v Speaker 5>force yourself to do stuff that's fun </v>
<v Speaker 5>and which sounds ridiculous,</v>

607
00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:42.320
<v Speaker 5>but you did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You got to just force yourself to make </v>

608
00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:42.320
<v Speaker 5>sure that you do it on a regular,</v>
<v Speaker 5>regular basis.</v>

609
00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.350
<v Speaker 5>But other than that it's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

610
00:27:43.351 --> 00:27:47.280
<v Speaker 5>it's just a matter of finding something </v>
<v Speaker 5>that you do,</v>

611
00:27:47.430 --> 00:27:49.800
<v Speaker 5>that you enjoy doing and then just do </v>
<v Speaker 5>that shit.</v>

612
00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:51.750
<v Speaker 5>I just know that there's a lot of people</v>
<v Speaker 5>listening.</v>

613
00:27:52.290 --> 00:27:54.270
<v Speaker 5>All they do is listening,</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

614
00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:58.980
<v Speaker 5>and watch and they're not getting to do </v>
<v Speaker 5>as much as they could be doing.</v>

615
00:27:59.340 --> 00:28:04.340
<v Speaker 5>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You saying like some people that like </v>

616
00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:04.340
<v Speaker 5>tune into too much shit and don't </v>
<v Speaker 5>produce enough shit.</v>

617
00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:04.980
<v Speaker 5>So what you mean?</v>

618
00:28:05.030 --> 00:28:06.070
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like there's this,</v>

619
00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:09.660
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of people in this world </v>
<v Speaker 5>that don't like the way you put it.</v>

620
00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:12.270
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the way you said you're doing something,</v>

621
00:28:12.510 --> 00:28:14.970
<v Speaker 5>it's work,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you disqualified as work.</v>

622
00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:19.350
<v Speaker 5>You qualified as something you like </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing.</v>

623
00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:22.980
<v Speaker 5>It just happens to be work and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody else,</v>

624
00:28:23.290 --> 00:28:25.400
<v Speaker 5>like they might just qualify it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As I said,</v>

625
00:28:25.401 --> 00:28:26.250
<v Speaker 5>a lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

626
00:28:26.251 --> 00:28:28.840
<v Speaker 5>some people do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's perspective.</v>

627
00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:33.970
<v Speaker 5>Your perspective allows you to do as </v>
<v Speaker 5>much as you do and other people's </v>

628
00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:35.280
<v Speaker 5>perspective doesn't allow them to do as </v>
<v Speaker 5>much as they could do.</v>

629
00:28:35.430 --> 00:28:37.230
<v Speaker 5>That's a very good point because some </v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

630
00:28:37.231 --> 00:28:39.180
<v Speaker 5>even with things they used to love </v>
<v Speaker 5>doing,</v>

631
00:28:39.181 --> 00:28:41.160
<v Speaker 5>they don't love doing it anymore and </v>
<v Speaker 5>becomes a chore.</v>

632
00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:42.030
<v Speaker 5>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>exactly.</v>

633
00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:47.060
<v Speaker 5>This could never be a chore for me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You and the UFC could never be a chore </v>

634
00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:47.060
<v Speaker 5>for me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It'll never be a chore.</v>

635
00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:47.420
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not.</v>

636
00:28:47.730 --> 00:28:50.000
<v Speaker 5>It's not even possible.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I met you.</v>

637
00:28:50.030 --> 00:28:51.290
<v Speaker 5>You,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

638
00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:52.860

<v Speaker 5>you're a fucking master.</v>

639

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>when I was a little kid.</v>

643

<v Speaker 5>until you're 16 so you can actually </v>

<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

669
00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:11.680
<v Speaker 8>That kid of the family was giving him </v>

<v Speaker 8>That kid I'd be scared of.</v>

673
00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:16.420
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well he's still a little.</v>

674
00:30:17.030 --> 00:30:19.020
<v Speaker 8>They get cheerios and throw it on the </v>
<v Speaker 8>gram.</v>

00:30:19.021 --> 00:30:20.250
<v Speaker 8>Like here's cheerios.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Get away from you.</v>

676
00:30:20.251 --> 00:30:22.090
<v Speaker 8>It's probably never been kicked in the </v>
<v Speaker 8>Dick before.</v>

677
00:30:22.091 --> 00:30:27.091
<v Speaker 8>You would have no idea how to react.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You don't develop the right kind of </v>

678
00:30:27.091 --> 00:30:28.090
<v Speaker 8>composure when you're six to take a full</v>
<v Speaker 8>shot to the Dick.</v>

679
00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:32.110
<v Speaker 8>I start kicking him in the Dick.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He doesn't have strong gonna run,</v>

680
00:30:32.111 --> 00:30:34.690
<v Speaker 8>crying and screaming and he's not going </v>
<v Speaker 8>to think of doing it first.</v>

681
00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:39.730
<v Speaker 8>You just go right for his little Dick.</v>

682
00:30:39.730 --> 00:30:42.660
<v Speaker 8>boot.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Your defense would be saying that Santa </v>

683
00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:43.500
<v Speaker 8>Claus isn't real and stuff like get away</v>
<v Speaker 8>from me isn't real.</v>

684
00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:48.330
<v Speaker 8>Where you could talk about kicking a six</v>
<v Speaker 8>year old in the artificial sixth year.</v>

685
00:30:48.340 --> 00:30:53.340
<v Speaker 8>It was a real six year old like saying </v>
<v Speaker 8>you should actually go out there and </v>

686
00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:53.710
<v Speaker 8>kick back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is a complete.</v>

687
00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:55.120
<v Speaker 8>I mean that kid this day.</v>

688
00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:57.030

<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

689
00:30:57.031 --> 00:30:59.180
<v Speaker 3>that was a long ass time ago that he was</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a child.</v>

690
00:30:59.181 --> 00:31:01.380
<v Speaker 3>It's probably list.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sorry Buddy.</v>

691
00:31:01.650 --> 00:31:03.660
<v Speaker 3>We don't really mean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You should've got kicks on the deck.</v>

692
00:31:03.661 --> 00:31:07.770
<v Speaker 3>This is all hypothetical comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You say they get it,</v>

693
00:31:07.771 --> 00:31:12.771
<v Speaker 3>but under the Patriot Act I think we </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to disclose that we have to tell </v>

694
00:31:12.771 --> 00:31:13.510
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But um,</v>

695
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:14.670
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but even back then,</v>

696
00:31:14.671 --> 00:31:17.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like doing comedy never felt like,</v>

697
00:31:17.370 --> 00:31:18.880
<v Speaker 3>like real work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was like,</v>

698
00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:23.960
<v Speaker 3>it was the real work was the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you didn't know if you were going to </v>

699
00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:23.960
<v Speaker 3>make it and you're scared,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

700
00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:28.281
<v Speaker 3>like we'd be terrified.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when I first started out all I </v>

701
00:31:28.281 --> 00:31:29.110
<v Speaker 3>wanted to do our member very clear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what,</v>

702
00:31:29.170 --> 00:31:34.170
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how awesome it would be to pay your </v>

703
00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:34.170
<v Speaker 3>bills,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing comedy.</v>

704
00:31:34.170 --> 00:31:36.870
<v Speaker 3>So I saw all these guys that were like </v>
<v Speaker 3>the main headliners and Boston and all I</v>

705
00:31:36.871 --> 00:31:40.350
<v Speaker 3>could think of was like man to one day </v>
<v Speaker 3>be able to pay my bills,</v>

706
00:31:40.351 --> 00:31:40.860
<v Speaker 3>doing comedy.</v>

707
00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:45.920
<v Speaker 3>I never thought that I would get to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>point where people would actually come </v>

708
00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:50.361
<v Speaker 3>out to see me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I could just like headline at </v>

709
00:31:50.361 --> 00:31:53.361
<v Speaker 3>a club and that would be who would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>there that weekend because the way it </v>

710
00:31:53.361 --> 00:31:57.201
<v Speaker 3>worked in Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like you looked at the local </v>

711
00:31:57.201 --> 00:31:59.391
<v Speaker 3>lineups,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Kevin Knox would be there one </v>

712
00:31:59.391 --> 00:31:59.391
<v Speaker 3>weekend and then Robbie printz would be </v>
<v Speaker 3>there the next week.</v>

713
00:31:59.391 --> 00:32:01.860
<v Speaker 3>The guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was all the same dudes that worked in</v>

714
00:32:01.861 --> 00:32:05.910
<v Speaker 3>our circuit and we sort of went in all </v>
<v Speaker 3>these different Boston comics.</v>

715
00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:07.920
<v Speaker 3>Really good,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very good,</v>

716
00:32:08.010 --> 00:32:13.010
<v Speaker 3>very good comics and so like you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What you hope for is to get into that </v>

717
00:32:13.010 --> 00:32:17.211
<v Speaker 3>line up with your hope for it to be one </v>
<v Speaker 3>of those guys where you're making a </v>

718
00:32:17.211 --> 00:32:17.211
<v Speaker 3>living,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

719
00:32:17.211 --> 00:32:21.921
<v Speaker 3>just telling jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because I would look at those guys like </v>

720
00:32:21.921 --> 00:32:22.350
<v Speaker 3>would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy doesn't have a job at all.</v>

721
00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:25.160
<v Speaker 3>All he does is tell jokes while there's </v>
<v Speaker 3>that kid,</v>

722
00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:28.320
<v Speaker 8>Jesus Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's so sick.</v>

723
00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:31.170
<v Speaker 8>They were given that kid steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Man.</v>

724
00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:33.960
<v Speaker 8>That's so funny.</v>
<v Speaker 8>How old is he there?</v>

725
00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.460
<v Speaker 8>Seven.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What?</v>

726
00:32:35.670 --> 00:32:37.200
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's so crazy.</v>

727
00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:40.370
<v Speaker 8>That's so sad too,</v>
<v Speaker 8>because that his whole system,</v>

728
00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:43.880
<v Speaker 1>it just gets fucking red line at an </v>
<v Speaker 1>early age like that.</v>

729
00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:47.910
<v Speaker 1>Pumping all that shit into his body </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's really hard for top,</v>

730
00:32:48.010 --> 00:32:48.620
<v Speaker 1>top.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

731
00:32:48.621 --> 00:32:52.070
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard for a kid to get that </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of muscle development at seven.</v>

732
00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:54.320
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't mean it is possible.</v>

733
00:32:54.321 --> 00:32:55.670
<v Speaker 1>You could be some freak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

734
00:32:55.671 --> 00:32:57.410
<v Speaker 1>if you looked at this with like blurry </v>
<v Speaker 1>eyes,</v>

735
00:32:57.411 --> 00:32:58.370
<v Speaker 1>he would swear his.</v>

736
00:32:58.650 --> 00:33:03.650
<v Speaker 8>It's hanging out.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I know I didn't want to say anything </v>

737
00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:07.671
<v Speaker 8>because his thumbs in the perfect spot.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm going to send a lot of pedophiles to</v>

738
00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:12.210
<v Speaker 8>decide they're going to go wacky.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is like free free pedophilia.</v>

739
00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:17.240
<v Speaker 8>Like you can get away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You can pretend and just get away with </v>

740
00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:17.240
<v Speaker 8>it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Look at that TV over there too.</v>

741
00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:19.380
<v Speaker 8>Muscle bounds,</v>
<v Speaker 8>year old TV over there.</v>

742
00:33:19.381 --> 00:33:22.700

<v Speaker 8>It does.</v>

743
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:24.780
<v Speaker 8>If you're a little further away,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if you just squinted,</v>

744
00:33:24.781 --> 00:33:29.781
<v Speaker 8>if you're looking at it on your phone,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you would swear that if you don't have </v>

745
00:33:29.781 --> 00:33:29.781
<v Speaker 8>20 slash 20,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's a car.</v>

746
00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:31.740
<v Speaker 8>Don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Beaver cleaver.</v>

747
00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:33.420
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he's a,</v>

748
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:36.270
<v Speaker 8>he looks very like thick faced like </v>
<v Speaker 8>instrumental</v>

749
00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:38.550
<v Speaker 3>boy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But that poor kid,</v>

750
00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:39.810
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck they did to him.</v>

751
00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:41.800
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

752
00:33:41.801 --> 00:33:44.200
<v Speaker 1>when we were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we were doing comedy back then,</v>

753
00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:44.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

754
00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:49.890
<v Speaker 1>in Boston it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I still wasn't really like a </v>

755
00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:53.790
<v Speaker 1>professional.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've only been doing it a couple of </v>

756
00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:53.790
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't,</v>

757
00:33:53.790 --> 00:33:53.790
<v Speaker 1>I could fall apart at any moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

758
00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:57.190
<v Speaker 1>and I still didn't think that I would </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever like continued to be able to pay my</v>

759
00:33:57.191 --> 00:33:58.300
<v Speaker 1>bills,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing comedy.</v>

760
00:33:58.301 --> 00:33:59.050
<v Speaker 1>Like I was still like,</v>

761
00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:01.900
<v Speaker 3>did you make any money up there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I made a little.</v>

762
00:34:01.930 --> 00:34:06.930
<v Speaker 3>When I first started going to New York </v>
<v Speaker 3>was when I got a manager and that was </v>

763
00:34:06.930 --> 00:34:08.990
<v Speaker 3>the first manager I ever got.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

764
00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:14.070
<v Speaker 3>when I got that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the best thing about it is that he </v>

765
00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:14.650
<v Speaker 3>started getting the books in like these </v>
<v Speaker 3>little clubs,</v>

766
00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:16.330
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean even our couldn't headline.</v>

767
00:34:16.331 --> 00:34:18.340
<v Speaker 3>I could middle and spots and I can make </v>
<v Speaker 3>a living,</v>

768
00:34:19.300 --> 00:34:20.460
<v Speaker 3>but I knew that I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

769
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:25.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to like progress past that and </v>

770
00:34:25.470 --> 00:34:25.570
<v Speaker 3>figuring out a way to actually have </v>
<v Speaker 3>enough money.</v>

771
00:34:25.690 --> 00:34:28.580
<v Speaker 3>So for sure I knew how to pay my bills </v>
<v Speaker 3>because he was still like,</v>

772
00:34:28.620 --> 00:34:31.720
<v Speaker 3>touch and go all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who was your manager back then?</v>

773
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:33.620
<v Speaker 3>Same Guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Same guys today sitting.</v>

774
00:34:33.650 --> 00:34:34.170
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

775
00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:35.910
<v Speaker 3>he picked me up when I was an open </v>
<v Speaker 3>miker.</v>

776
00:34:35.930 --> 00:34:37.120
<v Speaker 3>Who is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeff Salzman.</v>

777
00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:38.050
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeff Salzman.</v>

778
00:34:38.250 --> 00:34:40.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's the shit.</v>

779
00:34:41.170 --> 00:34:43.510
<v Speaker 3>He's a great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like an old school manager,</v>

780
00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:48.550
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's like one of those guys who was </v>

781
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:50.340
<v Speaker 3>people care talent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of a little piece of paper in </v>

782
00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:50.340
<v Speaker 3>his pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He writes his notes,</v>

783
00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:53.590
<v Speaker 3>he's just fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's an awesome human to just a really,</v>

784
00:34:53.591 --> 00:34:55.480
<v Speaker 3>really great guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't like me talking about him.</v>

785
00:34:55.481 --> 00:35:00.481
<v Speaker 3>So I stopped talking about them now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's been my manager since I was </v>

786
00:35:00.481 --> 00:35:03.910
<v Speaker 3>like 22 or some shit when I met you at </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Boston.</v>

787
00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:07.090
<v Speaker 3>Like I think like we're in different </v>
<v Speaker 3>mental comedy phases.</v>

788
00:35:07.091 --> 00:35:10.030
<v Speaker 3>Like I was trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had some material that got me into the</v>

789
00:35:10.031 --> 00:35:13.930
<v Speaker 3>Boston and I was trying to get off that </v>
<v Speaker 3>material and just come up with new shit.</v>

790
00:35:14.090 --> 00:35:15.070
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then.</v>

791
00:35:15.270 --> 00:35:20.270
<v Speaker 3>So then there was moments when I just </v>
<v Speaker 3>struggled for a while just trying to </v>

792
00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:24.001
<v Speaker 3>figure shit out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And at the same time I was repeating a </v>

793
00:35:24.001 --> 00:35:26.500
<v Speaker 3>lot of mistakes and I wasn't a writing </v>
<v Speaker 3>as much as I should.</v>

794
00:35:26.501 --> 00:35:27.670
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you writing a lot back then</v>

795
00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:29.990
<v Speaker 1>it tried to try to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

796
00:35:30.310 --> 00:35:35.310
<v Speaker 1>I tried to constantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I feel real bad if I don't constantly </v>

797
00:35:35.310 --> 00:35:37.000
<v Speaker 1>come up with new material.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I went through a phase,</v>

798
00:35:37.110 --> 00:35:37.980
<v Speaker 1>the beginning where I was</v>

799
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:42.980
<v Speaker 3>writing a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't know how to write very </v>

800
00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:42.990
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So most of it was shit like man,</v>

801
00:35:42.991 --> 00:35:44.910
<v Speaker 3>when I would like when I was living in </v>
<v Speaker 3>new Rochelle.</v>

802
00:35:44.911 --> 00:35:48.960
<v Speaker 3>So when I was in New York I wrote,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wrote three pages of it.</v>

803
00:35:48.961 --> 00:35:52.290
<v Speaker 3>That might be one line that should be </v>
<v Speaker 3>considered a second time.</v>

804
00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:55.130
<v Speaker 3>I'll go back and look,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've keeps,</v>

805
00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.580
<v Speaker 3>I've kept some of my notebooks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go back and look at my writing,</v>

806
00:35:57.581 --> 00:36:00.270
<v Speaker 3>but it was a box.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is horseshit.</v>

807
00:36:00.271 --> 00:36:03.690
<v Speaker 3>It's just utter complete horseshit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

808
00:36:03.750 --> 00:36:05.730
<v Speaker 3>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was just hard to write,</v>

809
00:36:05.790 --> 00:36:07.740
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I had to develop a point of view.</v>

810
00:36:07.770 --> 00:36:11.280
<v Speaker 3>You have to become a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>an actualized human being.</v>

811
00:36:11.281 --> 00:36:16.281
<v Speaker 3>You can't just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can't just write with no life </v>

812
00:36:16.281 --> 00:36:16.281
<v Speaker 3>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that's essentially what I was doing.</v>

813
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:18.690
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't belong.</v>

814
00:36:19.050 --> 00:36:21.450
<v Speaker 3>I shouldn't have been the one talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really didn't deserve it.</v>

815
00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:25.050
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have enough to say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't think about what I was going to</v>

816
00:36:25.051 --> 00:36:25.760
<v Speaker 3>say.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't,</v>

817
00:36:25.761 --> 00:36:27.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just trying to stumble through it.</v>

818
00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:28.560
<v Speaker 3>Like most 20 years,</v>

819
00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:30.690
<v Speaker 7>like I felt that a lot of times it's </v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

820
00:36:30.691 --> 00:36:32.130
<v Speaker 7>what the fuck am I saying?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>

821
00:36:32.131 --> 00:36:35.280
<v Speaker 7>you're just trying to be.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He's trying to be funny.</v>

822
00:36:35.281 --> 00:36:38.430
<v Speaker 7>So you were watching people and you're </v>
<v Speaker 7>getting ideas of funny.</v>

823
00:36:38.480 --> 00:36:39.250
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And,</v>

824
00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:40.830
<v Speaker 7>and you're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're trying to build something.</v>

825
00:36:40.831 --> 00:36:41.790
<v Speaker 7>You don't even know what you're </v>
<v Speaker 7>building.</v>

826
00:36:41.791 --> 00:36:46.791
<v Speaker 7>You don't know what.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You should have a perspective and kind </v>

827
00:36:46.791 --> 00:36:48.450
<v Speaker 7>of right from there like you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you have no idea.</v>

828
00:36:48.451 --> 00:36:52.950
<v Speaker 7>Shit is just happening and you and </v>
<v Speaker 7>somehow you figure it out later on.</v>

829
00:36:52.951 --> 00:36:57.951
<v Speaker 7>But in the beginning they,</v>
<v Speaker 7>maybe only a few people know exactly </v>

830
00:36:57.951 --> 00:36:59.040
<v Speaker 7>what they're supposed to do.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

831
00:36:59.520 --> 00:37:04.520
<v Speaker 3>It seems so easy when you watch it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you watch a guy like say if you're </v>

832
00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:07.851
<v Speaker 3>seeing a guy on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a good example,</v>

833
00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:11.280
<v Speaker 3>like a Jerry Seinfeld type character,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he seems like he's just talking.</v>

834
00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:13.020
<v Speaker 3>He's just talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just,</v>

835
00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:18.110
<v Speaker 3>he knows how to pause at the right time </v>
<v Speaker 3>and in the timing and pause the way it </v>

836
00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:23.040
<v Speaker 3>cracks the material inside your echoes </v>
<v Speaker 3>off the inside of your brain.</v>

837
00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:26.700
<v Speaker 3>But it looks easy and if you've ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>made your friends laugh,</v>

838
00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:28.890
<v Speaker 3>like I was trying to explain this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this young kid the other day,</v>

839
00:37:28.891 --> 00:37:30.510
<v Speaker 3>this kid came up to me and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

840
00:37:30.511 --> 00:37:35.511
<v Speaker 3>I just started doing comedy and he lives</v>
<v Speaker 3>up in Santa Barbara and it's like we've </v>

841
00:37:35.511 --> 00:37:36.600
<v Speaker 3>got a little amateur scene up here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Not much,</v>

842
00:37:36.601 --> 00:37:41.601
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm practicing there and then I'm gonna </v>

843
00:37:41.601 --> 00:37:42.480
<v Speaker 3>eventually come down to La and do some </v>
<v Speaker 3>real open mics and this and that.</v>

844
00:37:43.530 --> 00:37:46.470
<v Speaker 3>And he's at that spot where you start </v>
<v Speaker 3>out and you're like,</v>

845
00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:47.540
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>

846
00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:50.090
<v Speaker 3>can I fucking do this?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>

847
00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:51.150
<v Speaker 3>why'd you want to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

848
00:37:51.151 --> 00:37:53.400
<v Speaker 3>because I make my friends laugh all the </v>
<v Speaker 3>time because I could.</v>

849
00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:55.440
<v Speaker 3>I could kill like a bunch of people at a</v>
<v Speaker 3>party.</v>

850
00:37:55.441 --> 00:37:57.000
<v Speaker 3>I'll say some funny shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

851
00:37:57.001 --> 00:37:59.040
<v Speaker 3>Especially if I'm a little drunk.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>

852
00:37:59.041 --> 00:37:59.850
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me tell you something.</v>

853
00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:02.130
<v Speaker 3>If you can do that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you do that in a party,</v>

854
00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:07.400
<v Speaker 3>you can do that on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You just have to figure out how to do </v>

855
00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:07.400
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it ain't gonna be easy.</v>

856
00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:10.140
<v Speaker 3>It's going to be confusing because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>seems like it should be easy,</v>

857
00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:15.920
<v Speaker 3>but the ability to relay a thought to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bunch of strangers and have them accept </v>

858
00:38:15.920 --> 00:38:20.301
<v Speaker 3>that thought and it's most efficient </v>
<v Speaker 3>form and have it hit notes that they </v>

859
00:38:20.341 --> 00:38:23.060
<v Speaker 3>didn't see coming.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's hard to do,</v>

860
00:38:23.070 --> 00:38:23.460
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

861
00:38:23.610 --> 00:38:26.430
<v Speaker 7>It is hard to do and it's like </v>
<v Speaker 7>indifferent.</v>

862
00:38:26.650 --> 00:38:31.650
<v Speaker 7>I don't know about you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but in different stages of my comedy </v>

863
00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:31.650
<v Speaker 7>career,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I.</v>

864
00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:31.800
<v Speaker 7>They were things I was trying to figure </v>
<v Speaker 7>out.</v>

865
00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:35.890
<v Speaker 7>So what you mentioned about talking to </v>
<v Speaker 7>that kid like one time it was like,</v>

866
00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:36.680
<v Speaker 7>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

867
00:38:36.690 --> 00:38:41.690
<v Speaker 7>I guess I'm kind of funny but I'm not as</v>
<v Speaker 7>funny as I am in conversations with </v>

868
00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:42.400
<v Speaker 7>people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So how do I transfer offstage,</v>

869
00:38:42.401 --> 00:38:47.401
<v Speaker 7>meet on stage and then so then I have to</v>
<v Speaker 7>think about like I took awhile to </v>

870
00:38:48.581 --> 00:38:51.420
<v Speaker 7>examine that for like maybe a year or </v>
<v Speaker 7>so.</v>

871
00:38:51.421 --> 00:38:56.421
<v Speaker 7>It's like I need to be me offstage.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I need to bring that dude onstage </v>

872
00:38:56.421 --> 00:38:58.890
<v Speaker 7>because the onstage dude,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's kind of different than the offstage</v>

873
00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:02.380
<v Speaker 7>dude and I just want to be one person I </v>
<v Speaker 7>don't want to be too.</v>

874
00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:07.740
<v Speaker 7>So then it was just like so many like </v>
<v Speaker 7>things you've got to go through to build</v>

875
00:39:09.431 --> 00:39:14.431
<v Speaker 7>yourself into who you gonna end up being</v>
<v Speaker 7>enslaved and then there's perspective </v>

876
00:39:14.431 --> 00:39:18.490
<v Speaker 7>and then there's jokes was my writing </v>
<v Speaker 7>style and that changes from time to time</v>

877
00:39:18.810 --> 00:39:20.830
<v Speaker 7>and it's sometimes you have a set that's</v>
<v Speaker 7>really good,</v>

878
00:39:20.831 --> 00:39:25.831
<v Speaker 7>but then as you get tired of it and then</v>
<v Speaker 7>you gotta come up with some stuff that </v>

879
00:39:25.831 --> 00:39:26.380
<v Speaker 7>you're not tired of new stuff.</v>

880
00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:28.480
<v Speaker 7>It's just like it's an ongoing thing.</v>

881
00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:34.100
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the knowing when to put new stuff </v>

882
00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:35.280
<v Speaker 3>out there too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's the beginning of standup comedy,</v>

883
00:39:35.281 --> 00:39:40.281
<v Speaker 3>like developing it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess it'd probably be just like </v>

884
00:39:40.281 --> 00:39:40.281
<v Speaker 3>developing a band,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

885
00:39:40.281 --> 00:39:43.600
<v Speaker 3>the band doesn't know what the fuck it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>still in the beginning either and then </v>

886
00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:43.600
<v Speaker 3>you get together,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you fucking bang on some jobs.</v>

887
00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:48.201
<v Speaker 3>Somebody comes up with some chords,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you figure out how to write some words </v>

888
00:39:48.201 --> 00:39:49.420
<v Speaker 3>down and who knows what it becomes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A lot of times bands changed too.</v>

889
00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:52.050
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the time we were,</v>

890
00:39:52.051 --> 00:39:54.600
<v Speaker 3>we were in very similar positions that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

891
00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:56.580
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like what the fuck am I doing time?</v>

892
00:39:56.740 --> 00:39:57.080
<v Speaker 7>It's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>

893
00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:57.680
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

894
00:39:57.681 --> 00:39:58.370
<v Speaker 7>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

895
00:39:58.371 --> 00:40:00.860
<v Speaker 7>you want to make people laugh and that's</v>
<v Speaker 7>all you got.</v>

896
00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.600
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like somebody saying,</v>

897
00:40:02.910 --> 00:40:05.450
<v Speaker 7>here's the topic,</v>
<v Speaker 7>write a movie.</v>

898
00:40:06.130 --> 00:40:07.490
<v Speaker 7>The topic is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

899
00:40:07.820 --> 00:40:09.290
<v Speaker 7>going to the store now,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

900
00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:12.980
<v Speaker 7>A 120 page script about going into the </v>
<v Speaker 7>store and it's like,</v>

901
00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:18.040
<v Speaker 7>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's all you're going to give me a </v>

902
00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:18.040
<v Speaker 7>comic days.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like I know I want to make people that I</v>

903
00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:20.840
<v Speaker 7>could go there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There's a stage getting that figured out</v>

904
00:40:20.841 --> 00:40:21.830
<v Speaker 7>as fast as you can.</v>

905
00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:26.900
<v Speaker 3>Every anybody has.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody has their own path and your </v>

906
00:40:26.900 --> 00:40:27.840
<v Speaker 3>way of doing it just because like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I can't,</v>

907
00:40:27.841 --> 00:40:30.240
<v Speaker 3>I would not do comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Stephen writes way.</v>

908
00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:32.400
<v Speaker 3>That's his way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He came up with it.</v>

909
00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:33.840
<v Speaker 3>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was awesome.</v>

910
00:40:33.870 --> 00:40:36.330
<v Speaker 3>Obviously it was brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Obviously it was amazing,</v>

911
00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:38.000
<v Speaker 3>but that's how,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

912
00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:39.750
<v Speaker 3>that's his thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he found that thing.</v>

913
00:40:39.850 --> 00:40:44.520
<v Speaker 3>So that's proof positive that there's no</v>
<v Speaker 3>real prescription for this.</v>

914
00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:46.800
<v Speaker 3>There's no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's no real guidebook.</v>

915
00:40:46.801 --> 00:40:49.350
<v Speaker 3>You got to see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's got their own funny.</v>

916
00:40:49.530 --> 00:40:52.050
<v Speaker 3>Mitch Hedberg is funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's different than Cat Williams.</v>

917
00:40:52.051 --> 00:40:55.820
<v Speaker 3>Funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's got their own with those two</v>

918
00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:56.580
<v Speaker 3>guys are similar.</v>

919
00:41:00.300 --> 00:41:03.810
<v Speaker 3>Mitch Hedberg the same purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 3>not well,</v>

920
00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:06.600
<v Speaker 3>maybe similar in their choices.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

921
00:41:06.601 --> 00:41:07.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Crazy,</v>

922
00:41:07.890 --> 00:41:11.730
<v Speaker 3>crazy making choices,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's in that beginning,</v>

923
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:14.310
<v Speaker 3>if you don't know if you're making the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right decision or the wrong decision,</v>

924
00:41:14.311 --> 00:41:19.311
<v Speaker 3>you're going down past and trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>figure out what's the right one and you </v>

925
00:41:19.311 --> 00:41:19.311
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went for A.</v>

926
00:41:19.311 --> 00:41:21.570
<v Speaker 3>I went for a period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was trying to dress up nice.</v>

927
00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:28.700
<v Speaker 3>Larry Snow wearing was my manager.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Talked me into it man.</v>

928
00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:31.030
<v Speaker 3>I wore like a nice button up dress </v>
<v Speaker 3>shirt,</v>

929
00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:36.800
<v Speaker 3>club support that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a cool period and I thought I </v>

930
00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:40.901
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I know you mean you're thinking of when </v>

931
00:41:40.901 --> 00:41:40.901
<v Speaker 3>my album came out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

932
00:41:40.901 --> 00:41:42.320
<v Speaker 3>That was just an idea I did only for the</v>
<v Speaker 3>album.</v>

933
00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:45.320
<v Speaker 3>It was the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea was that I figured out a way to</v>

934
00:41:45.321 --> 00:41:48.200
<v Speaker 3>get through life without wearing a tie </v>
<v Speaker 3>and when I was a,</v>

935
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:50.690
<v Speaker 3>when I was working as a limo driver back</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Boston,</v>

936
00:41:50.691 --> 00:41:55.691
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I thought I would like</v>
<v Speaker 3>to get through life where I never have </v>

937
00:41:55.691 --> 00:41:55.691
<v Speaker 3>to wear a fucking tie.</v>

938
00:41:55.691 --> 00:41:56.540
<v Speaker 3>Like that was like a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like when people say,</v>

939
00:41:56.541 --> 00:42:01.541
<v Speaker 3>what do you want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to get through life without ever </v>

940
00:42:01.541 --> 00:42:03.821
<v Speaker 3>wearing a fucking tie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when I finally got something that </v>

941
00:42:04.041 --> 00:42:06.830
<v Speaker 3>was on like a copy of something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a CD,</v>

942
00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:09.380
<v Speaker 3>that was my first thing that ever </v>
<v Speaker 3>released at all.</v>

943
00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:14.680
<v Speaker 3>So it was like putting that on like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let me wear a fucking times suit jacket </v>

944
00:42:14.680 --> 00:42:15.020
<v Speaker 3>just for goof.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it was a mess.</v>

945
00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:17.940
<v Speaker 3>It was a good mix for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was just.</v>

946
00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:23.140
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That'd be cool if you did that all the </v>

947
00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:23.140
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well I don't.</v>

948
00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:23.960
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't really like ties,</v>

949
00:42:23.961 --> 00:42:28.961
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that especially with my history </v>

950
00:42:28.961 --> 00:42:28.961
<v Speaker 3>in Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to wear something around my</v>

951
00:42:28.961 --> 00:42:31.010
<v Speaker 3>neck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You could choke and I'm not into that.</v>

952
00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:36.040
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Too many dudes that could put me to </v>

953
00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:36.040
<v Speaker 3>sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they grabbed my tie.</v>

954
00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:40.080
<v Speaker 3>That's funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I hate suits because the only time you </v>

955
00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:40.080
<v Speaker 3>wear them is that a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a funeral?</v>

956
00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:41.720
<v Speaker 3>So I wanted to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nothing.</v>

957
00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:45.350
<v Speaker 3>No funeral attire ever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I just hate to hate it.</v>

958
00:42:45.351 --> 00:42:46.730
<v Speaker 3>Suit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So that's why.</v>

959
00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:51.760
<v Speaker 3>That's one of the reasons why comedy </v>
<v Speaker 3>fits perfect and you'll always run into </v>

960
00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:54.701
<v Speaker 3>like a manager or somebody that has a </v>
<v Speaker 3>room that wants you to dress up and you </v>

961
00:42:54.701 --> 00:42:58.511
<v Speaker 3>just feel like a rash breaking out just </v>
<v Speaker 3>at the thought of having to put some </v>

962
00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:02.500
<v Speaker 3>formal shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hell No.</v>

963
00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:04.880
<v Speaker 3>I dressed real nice at the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world party though.</v>

964
00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:05.510
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you did?</v>

965
00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:06.770
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That show A.</v>

966
00:43:06.771 --> 00:43:11.030
<v Speaker 3>I wore a suit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wear like a tailor made suit and pants</v>

967
00:43:11.031 --> 00:43:12.950
<v Speaker 3>and a nice shirt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't wear a tie though,</v>

968
00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:17.260
<v Speaker 3>but I thought it looked very like so you</v>
<v Speaker 3>weren't chalkable sophisticated.</v>

969
00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:22.310
<v Speaker 3>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just got off work and if you have any </v>

<v Speaker 3>before then,</v>

979
00:43:39.921 --> 00:43:44.921

<v Speaker 3>Like she'll tap a man.</v>

988
00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:01.170
<v Speaker 3>No doubt type of man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She gets your arm.</v>

989
00:44:01.171 --> 00:44:02.410
<v Speaker 3>She'll break your fucking arm,</v>
<v Speaker 3>son.</v>

990
00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:07.680
<v Speaker 3>She was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She break it on the second level of </v>

991
00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:07.680
<v Speaker 3>women that could break my arm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She will no doubt about it.</v>

992
00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:12.191
<v Speaker 3>She has tapped six women in a row,</v>
<v Speaker 3>six first round armbars these.</v>

993
00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:14.130
<v Speaker 3>They can't fuck with it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her arm bar.</v>

994
00:44:14.131 --> 00:44:17.180
<v Speaker 3>It's just so nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She flips you around until she gets it.</v>

995
00:44:17.181 --> 00:44:19.040
<v Speaker 3>She's done it a million times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Her arm bars,</v>

996
00:44:19.041 --> 00:44:21.140
<v Speaker 3>so god damned good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I seen an interview,</v>

997
00:44:21.141 --> 00:44:26.141
<v Speaker 3>but I've never seen a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She's fought six times with the same </v>

998
00:44:26.141 --> 00:44:29.981
<v Speaker 3>exact move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody's ever done that in the history </v>

999
00:44:29.981 --> 00:44:30.590
<v Speaker 3>of MMA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's really fucking crazy.</v>

1000
00:44:30.591 --> 00:44:31.740
<v Speaker 3>When you stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think about it,</v>

1001
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:36.660
<v Speaker 3>there's not one person who became a </v>
<v Speaker 3>champion and all of their fights leading</v>

1002
00:44:36.661 --> 00:44:39.160
<v Speaker 3>up to the championship.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're one in the exact same message.</v>

1003
00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:41.280
<v Speaker 3>You only see that in the ww.</v>

1004
00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:48.610
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's going for some dudes that have won </v>

1005
00:44:48.610 --> 00:44:48.750
<v Speaker 6>a lot,</v>

1006
00:44:48.810 --> 00:44:53.810
<v Speaker 3>but like even more than she has.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this is a guy named Paul Sas and </v>

1007
00:44:53.810 --> 00:44:57.141
<v Speaker 3>he's got a really good guard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This kid is nasty off his back and he </v>

1008
00:44:57.141 --> 00:45:01.221
<v Speaker 3>taps people by triangle all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think he has something like nine </v>

1009
00:45:01.221 --> 00:45:02.910
<v Speaker 3>taps by triangle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is like unheard of.</v>

1010
00:45:03.300 --> 00:45:06.150
<v Speaker 3>Unheard of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he also won by.</v>

1011
00:45:06.151 --> 00:45:07.440
<v Speaker 3>He'll hook.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

1012
00:45:07.441 --> 00:45:12.441
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's lost a fight or two since he got </v>

1013
00:45:12.441 --> 00:45:12.441
<v Speaker 3>tapped.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Recently.</v>

1014
00:45:12.441 --> 00:45:13.350
<v Speaker 3>Someone took us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think Matt Wyman tapped him.</v>

1015
00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:16.230
<v Speaker 3>So it's like he's had some bad results </v>
<v Speaker 3>with her.</v>

1016
00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:21.380
<v Speaker 3>It's just every single result was she </v>
<v Speaker 3>wins by Armbar her whole career.</v>

1017
00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:26.540
<v Speaker 3>That's craziness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's pretty unusual for a chick was </v>

1018
00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:27.150
<v Speaker 3>hot as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh good.</v>

1019
00:45:27.330 --> 00:45:29.460
<v Speaker 3>Good Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Come on,</v>

1020
00:45:29.461 --> 00:45:30.730
<v Speaker 3>sign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's got to be nervous.</v>

1021
00:45:31.170 --> 00:45:33.960
<v Speaker 3>Unnerving.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A hot chick throws up flying triangle on</v>

1022
00:45:33.961 --> 00:45:37.740
<v Speaker 3>your ass because you're so close to </v>
<v Speaker 3>heaven and yet you're going to black out</v>

1023
00:45:37.741 --> 00:45:39.810
<v Speaker 3>any second.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now she's choking her legs.</v>

1024
00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:42.130
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's horrifying from man,</v>

1025
00:45:42.131 --> 00:45:45.750
<v Speaker 3>but that's the move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like she puts a leg on bar,</v>

1026
00:45:46.410 --> 00:45:50.190
<v Speaker 3>but it's a triangle triangle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The triangle has an well.</v>

1027
00:45:50.191 --> 00:45:54.930
<v Speaker 3>What it is is it has an arm stuck in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the legs are wrapped around your head</v>

1028
00:45:54.990 --> 00:45:56.270
<v Speaker 3>and shoulders.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Questioning,</v>

1029
00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:01.320
<v Speaker 3>chokes you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Has anybody tried to start eating her </v>

1030
00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:03.220
<v Speaker 3>pussy when they're in that move?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You</v>

1031
00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:08.260
<v Speaker 6>could,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but you don't have much time and you </v>

1032
00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:08.260
<v Speaker 6>would have to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You'd have to.</v>

1033
00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:11.150
<v Speaker 3>You train your tongue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm here.</v>

1034
00:46:11.151 --> 00:46:11.540
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's.</v>

1035
00:46:11.541 --> 00:46:16.541
<v Speaker 3>Let's just go through the motion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you might be able to eat my </v>

1036
00:46:16.541 --> 00:46:18.190
<v Speaker 3>pussy for a little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you got to get it</v>

1037
00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:20.050
<v Speaker 6>to work.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're going to have to get through that</v>

1038
00:46:20.051 --> 00:46:22.840
<v Speaker 6>span.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Index and granny panties.</v>

1039
00:46:22.890 --> 00:46:25.460
<v Speaker 6>She's got underneath there.</v>
<v Speaker 6>For you to be really effective.</v>

1040
00:46:25.461 --> 00:46:28.320
<v Speaker 6>If you're going to have to somehow know </v>
<v Speaker 6>the rip her panties open</v>

1041
00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:30.820
<v Speaker 3>during the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Suppose you practice that in training.</v>

1042
00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:32.770
<v Speaker 3>I don't think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're going to sleep.</v>

1043
00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:36.580
<v Speaker 3>I think she's going to be insulted that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you think you'd get out of combat,</v>

1044
00:46:36.610 --> 00:46:39.520
<v Speaker 3>but just eating her pussy like a woman </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you know,</v>

1045
00:46:39.521 --> 00:46:41.920
<v Speaker 3>a woman when she can tap you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>dominate you like that,</v>

1046
00:46:41.921 --> 00:46:44.080
<v Speaker 3>she's not going to respect you and allow</v>
<v Speaker 3>you to breed with her.</v>

1047
00:46:44.410 --> 00:46:48.450
<v Speaker 3>So just the fact that you got into that </v>
<v Speaker 3>position and it's her mercy that you.</v>

1048
00:46:48.590 --> 00:46:51.610
<v Speaker 3>She lets you eat her pussy and then she </v>
<v Speaker 3>kills you with her legs.</v>

1049
00:46:51.611 --> 00:46:54.820
<v Speaker 3>Is that what's going to happen there?</v>
<v Speaker 3>At least you get more pleasure.</v>

1050
00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:59.590
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if you do some lose,</v>
<v Speaker 6>lose anything.</v>

1051
00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:04.620
<v Speaker 3>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you were in that position when the </v>

1052
00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:04.620
<v Speaker 3>lights go out</v>

1053
00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:10.800
<v Speaker 6>crying,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like the ultimate perv begging me </v>

1054
00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:11.790
<v Speaker 6>alive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I feel.</v>

1055
00:47:13.520 --> 00:47:15.630
<v Speaker 3>Can you imagine her kaggle exercises?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Price.</v>

1056
00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:17.710
<v Speaker 3>Snap your chicken head right off.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1057
00:47:18.410 --> 00:47:21.290
<v Speaker 3>Don't let anybody tell you that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trying to get you in a tongue bar.</v>

1058
00:47:21.350 --> 00:47:26.350
<v Speaker 3>All vaginas are created equally because </v>
<v Speaker 3>of vagina that's built in a woman who's </v>

1059
00:47:26.750 --> 00:47:30.910
<v Speaker 3>built like a woman who has like a good </v>
<v Speaker 3>musculature is healthy.</v>

1060
00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:34.620
<v Speaker 3>Everything will be tight in there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's muscle ass,</v>

1061
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:35.340
<v Speaker 3>muscle,</v>
<v Speaker 3>leg,</v>

1062
00:47:35.350 --> 00:47:37.600
<v Speaker 3>muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a tighter vagina.</v>

1063
00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:42.630
<v Speaker 3>It's a better fit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She could pretty much give you a hand </v>

1064
00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:42.670
<v Speaker 3>job with her vagina.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1065
00:47:42.671 --> 00:47:45.340
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a world class athlete.</v>

1066
00:47:46.350 --> 00:47:51.350
<v Speaker 3>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and let's just say any random world </v>

1067
00:47:51.350 --> 00:47:54.181
<v Speaker 3>class athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't want to disrespect Rhonda by </v>

1068
00:47:54.181 --> 00:47:55.510
<v Speaker 3>speaking of her vagina graphic manner,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how we're buddies.</v>

1069
00:47:55.670 --> 00:48:00.670
<v Speaker 3>Name girl.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You see a girl who's like a serious </v>

1070
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:02.320
<v Speaker 3>crossfit athlete.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fucking that girl would probably be like</v>

1071
00:48:02.321 --> 00:48:04.690
<v Speaker 3>having sex with a fist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1072
00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:06.730
<v Speaker 3>like a girl is like really muscular.</v>

1073
00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:08.290
<v Speaker 3>It's probably better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense.</v>

1074
00:48:08.670 --> 00:48:10.330
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a reward.</v>

1075
00:48:10.331 --> 00:48:15.331
<v Speaker 3>The University of rewarding you for </v>
<v Speaker 3>meeting with someone who's not a lazy </v>

1076
00:48:15.331 --> 00:48:15.331
<v Speaker 3>bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm into.</v>

1077
00:48:15.331 --> 00:48:19.380
<v Speaker 3>I'm into that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's what I'm talking about and </v>

1078
00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:22.620
<v Speaker 3>thinking about that shit with a porn </v>
<v Speaker 3>star because they use it so much with </v>

1079
00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:22.620
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Build up that muscle and they lose their</v>

1080
00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:24.310
<v Speaker 3>tolerance skits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All sloppy.</v>

1081
00:48:24.670 --> 00:48:25.500
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1082
00:48:25.501 --> 00:48:30.501
<v Speaker 3>I mean porn star.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The reality of a porn star is they </v>

1083
00:48:30.501 --> 00:48:33.661
<v Speaker 3>probably don't have any more sex than </v>
<v Speaker 3>the average person because the average </v>

1084
00:48:33.881 --> 00:48:38.881
<v Speaker 3>person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're in your twenties and you have </v>

1085
00:48:38.881 --> 00:48:38.881
<v Speaker 3>your,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a boyfriend.</v>

1086
00:48:38.881 --> 00:48:39.160
<v Speaker 3>If you guys are monogamous,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that dude's gonna.</v>

1087
00:48:39.161 --> 00:48:44.161
<v Speaker 3>Try to fuck you at least five times a </v>
<v Speaker 3>week and if he doesn't fuck you five </v>

1088
00:48:44.161 --> 00:48:46.690
<v Speaker 3>times a week.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when you do,</v>

1089
00:48:48.670 --> 00:48:50.830
<v Speaker 3>especially if you're really stupid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're saying I don't want to do it.</v>

1090
00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:52.630
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're 20.</v>

1091
00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:55.510
<v Speaker 3>Everybody wants it's 21 to fuck every </v>
<v Speaker 3>day.</v>

1092
00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:58.020
<v Speaker 3>You know that's normal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So like every,</v>

1093
00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:03.120
<v Speaker 3>any normal girl who's like in her </v>
<v Speaker 3>twenties is probably getting fucked </v>

1094
00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:04.450
<v Speaker 3>constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If she has a boyfriend.</v>

1095
00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:05.830
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So what,</v>

1096
00:49:05.831 --> 00:49:07.150
<v Speaker 3>how much is a porn star?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have sex,</v>

1097
00:49:07.180 --> 00:49:08.740
<v Speaker 3>they have sex,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you know,</v>

1098
00:49:08.741 --> 00:49:10.810
<v Speaker 3>maybe they have sex with a few more </v>
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>

1099
00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:15.960
<v Speaker 3>but in a lot of ways being a porn star,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but other than the fact that people </v>

1100
00:49:16.511 --> 00:49:19.720
<v Speaker 3>watch and masturbate and then it becomes</v>
<v Speaker 3>a public thing,</v>

1101
00:49:19.721 --> 00:49:24.721
<v Speaker 3>then it becomes a weird thing where the </v>
<v Speaker 3>way you interface with people is a lot </v>

1102
00:49:24.721 --> 00:49:27.481
<v Speaker 3>of times sexual.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But if you think about the way porn </v>

1103
00:49:27.481 --> 00:49:30.730
<v Speaker 3>stars have relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really more like what that dude who</v>

1104
00:49:30.731 --> 00:49:35.731
<v Speaker 3>wrote a sex at dawn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dr Christopher Ryan was talking about </v>

1105
00:49:35.731 --> 00:49:38.560
<v Speaker 3>when he was talking about the communal </v>
<v Speaker 3>societies where they had multiple sexual</v>

1106
00:49:38.561 --> 00:49:39.100
<v Speaker 3>partners.</v>

1107
00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:41.530
<v Speaker 3>Because if these people are all just </v>
<v Speaker 3>having like what you said,</v>

1108
00:49:41.531 --> 00:49:43.510
<v Speaker 3>there's like five guys or something like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

1109
00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:44.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So they all just,</v>

1110
00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:47.500
<v Speaker 3>they have,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they all just trade off.</v>

1111
00:49:47.980 --> 00:49:52.810
<v Speaker 3>So really that's not that much different</v>
<v Speaker 3>than a lot of like regular girls.</v>

1112
00:49:52.811 --> 00:49:54.490
<v Speaker 3>Even if you're with a different dude </v>
<v Speaker 3>every night.</v>

1113
00:49:54.580 --> 00:49:56.590
<v Speaker 3>It's like some girl's boyfriend every </v>
<v Speaker 3>night.</v>

1114
00:49:56.710 --> 00:50:01.710
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some girls are with their boyfriend </v>

1115
00:50:01.710 --> 00:50:03.421
<v Speaker 3>every night and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and some girls who are playing the </v>

1116
00:50:03.421 --> 00:50:03.421
<v Speaker 3>field,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've got a couple different guys that</v>

1117
00:50:03.421 --> 00:50:07.321
<v Speaker 3>are competing for their attention,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means they're getting drilled by </v>

1118
00:50:07.321 --> 00:50:09.130
<v Speaker 3>like two or three different guys who are</v>
<v Speaker 3>also nonmonogamous.</v>

1119
00:50:09.370 --> 00:50:11.680
<v Speaker 3>So maybe they're having sex with other </v>
<v Speaker 3>people as well.</v>

1120
00:50:11.681 --> 00:50:16.681
<v Speaker 3>So like it's not that scary having sex </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a porn star that way at all in that</v>

1121
00:50:18.311 --> 00:50:23.311
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that way it's not that much </v>

1122
00:50:23.311 --> 00:50:25.201
<v Speaker 3>different than a regular person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if you could just have you count </v>

1123
00:50:25.201 --> 00:50:25.201
<v Speaker 3>the partners.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1124
00:50:25.201 --> 00:50:27.050
<v Speaker 3>the number might be different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if you count the amount of times you</v>

1125
00:50:27.051 --> 00:50:27.690
<v Speaker 3>having sex</v>

1126
00:50:28.420 --> 00:50:33.420
<v Speaker 1>and that probably is the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The number might not even be different </v>

1127
00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:36.401
<v Speaker 1>over time because what if the girl only </v>
<v Speaker 1>has sex when she's at work and you know </v>

1128
00:50:36.401 --> 00:50:38.180
<v Speaker 1>she can't have a relationship because </v>
<v Speaker 1>dudes can't deal with it or whatever the</v>

1129
00:50:38.181 --> 00:50:43.181
<v Speaker 1>fuck it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So she's only having sex at work so </v>

1130
00:50:43.181 --> 00:50:45.010
<v Speaker 1>she's only fucking the same three or </v>
<v Speaker 1>four guys for a whole year more.</v>

1131
00:50:45.011 --> 00:50:49.280
<v Speaker 1>Whereas another 20 year old girl who </v>
<v Speaker 1>likes to party and she does coke,</v>

1132
00:50:49.710 --> 00:50:51.060
<v Speaker 1>she might fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck</v>

1133
00:50:51.370 --> 00:50:53.800
<v Speaker 2>some guys a month in one night at Vegas,</v>

1134
00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:56.780
<v Speaker 1>things can get crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People do crazy shit.</v>

1135
00:50:57.110 --> 00:51:02.110
<v Speaker 1>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny that porn is such a gigantic </v>

1136
00:51:02.110 --> 00:51:04.430
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that it's still this weird thing,</v>

1137
00:51:04.431 --> 00:51:07.460
<v Speaker 1>this weird fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants to have sex,</v>

1138
00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:10.730
<v Speaker 1>but if you're having sex and people can </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch everybody's,</v>

1139
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:15.950
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck or more than like apple </v>
<v Speaker 2>won't put it in Itunes,</v>

1140
00:51:16.451 --> 00:51:21.451
<v Speaker 2>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you go to any hotel chain and you can </v>

1141
00:51:21.451 --> 00:51:22.340
<v Speaker 2>rent fucking any porn movie you went.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I watched the other day I was at the war</v>

1142
00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:26.350
<v Speaker 2>or some chain hotel and I've got like </v>
<v Speaker 2>double anal video.</v>

1143
00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:29.200

<v Speaker 2>why did you buy it on the TV?</v>

1144
00:51:29.201 --> 00:51:31.690
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you hit the girl I was with </v>
<v Speaker 2>was in it and we wanted to.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Like a bad molestation.</v>

1165
00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:19.030
<v Speaker 1>I don't even want to watch it about </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

1169
00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:31.981

00:52:40.121 --> 00:52:43.400
<v Speaker 1>like he doesn't even exist.</v>

<v Speaker 1>they didn't really commit suicide on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Saturday.</v>

1178
00:52:52.661 --> 00:52:54.340
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be a little more respectful son.</v>

1179
00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:59.460
<v Speaker 1>He was only 26 years old and they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason why he was incredibly </v>

1180
00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:03.931
<v Speaker 1>clinically depressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever he might have problems on his </v>

1181
00:53:03.931 --> 00:53:04.570
<v Speaker 1>own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on top of whatever problems he might</v>

1182
00:53:04.571 --> 00:53:09.571
<v Speaker 1>have had,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government was trying to go after </v>

1183
00:53:09.571 --> 00:53:11.050
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crazy fucking case and he was up for</v>

1184
00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:14.020
<v Speaker 1>a potential thing where he was going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be in jail for 50 years.</v>

1185
00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:16.280
<v Speaker 1>50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the charge?</v>

1186
00:53:16.281 --> 00:53:18.910
<v Speaker 1>Is it not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Anything to do with RSS Feeds?</v>

1187
00:53:18.911 --> 00:53:21.940
<v Speaker 1>Obviously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do not know the exact charges.</v>

1188
00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.260
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1189
00:53:23.310 --> 00:53:25.890
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they were trying to nail him with,</v>

1190
00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:26.250
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

1191
00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:28.130
<v Speaker 3>whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

1192
00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:33.150
<v Speaker 3>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The way it was being done was really </v>

1193
00:53:33.150 --> 00:53:34.170
<v Speaker 3>crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like this guy was,</v>

1194
00:53:34.710 --> 00:53:38.220
<v Speaker 3>he was like a big innovator in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the,</v>

1195
00:53:38.310 --> 00:53:43.310
<v Speaker 3>in the field of coding and the creation </v>
<v Speaker 3>of the rss feed is really important for </v>

1196
00:53:43.321 --> 00:53:44.360
<v Speaker 3>things like this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Podcasts,</v>

1197
00:53:44.590 --> 00:53:49.590
<v Speaker 3>like without his contribution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who knows what would've happened if me </v>

1198
00:53:49.590 --> 00:53:52.830
<v Speaker 3>and apparently by all accounts was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>very nice person.</v>

1199
00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:55.170
<v Speaker 3>Was He paid?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

1200
00:53:55.171 --> 00:53:57.450
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how much money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't know what his situation was,</v>

1201
00:53:57.451 --> 00:53:59.940
<v Speaker 3>but it doesn't matter when the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government's going after you like that.</v>

1202
00:53:59.941 --> 00:54:02.220
<v Speaker 3>Like it's either way you're fucked.</v>

1203
00:54:03.110 --> 00:54:05.780
<v Speaker 7>No.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know what I like about court cases,</v>

1204
00:54:06.490 --> 00:54:11.490
<v Speaker 7>how like a prosecutor will tell a </v>
<v Speaker 7>jewelry who you are as a defendant,</v>

1205
00:54:15.170 --> 00:54:20.170
<v Speaker 7>like this person.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We're going to tell you how we're going </v>

1206
00:54:20.170 --> 00:54:23.711
<v Speaker 7>to tell you what they did and how they </v>
<v Speaker 7>and why they thought of it and why they </v>

1207
00:54:23.711 --> 00:54:25.340
<v Speaker 7>did it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like you'd never met me.</v>

1208
00:54:25.820 --> 00:54:27.440
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how the fuck do you know?</v>

1209
00:54:28.010 --> 00:54:30.770
<v Speaker 7>It's like you made this story up and </v>
<v Speaker 7>you're going to try to prove it,</v>

1210
00:54:30.890 --> 00:54:32.750
<v Speaker 7>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you don't fucking know me.</v>

1211
00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:37.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1212
00:54:37.901 --> 00:54:42.901
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's very weird when someone decides </v>

1213
00:54:42.901 --> 00:54:45.061
<v Speaker 3>that they're going to take you in front </v>
<v Speaker 3>of a group of people that are going to </v>

1214
00:54:45.061 --> 00:54:48.571
<v Speaker 3>define you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>write a bunch of strangers who have to </v>

1215
00:54:48.571 --> 00:54:50.380
<v Speaker 3>like judge you carefully and really the </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that judge you,</v>

1216
00:54:50.381 --> 00:54:55.381
<v Speaker 3>the people that actually know you and </v>
<v Speaker 3>would know what kind of person you are </v>

1217
00:54:55.381 --> 00:54:55.860
<v Speaker 3>and what you did right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and what you're capable of.</v>

1218
00:54:55.870 --> 00:54:59.080
<v Speaker 3>When you see jury,</v>
<v Speaker 3>people like God,</v>

1219
00:54:59.130 --> 00:55:04.130
<v Speaker 3>you've got to rely on their opinions and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to rely on whether or not some </v>

1220
00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:06.950
<v Speaker 3>dude who's really crafty with the words </v>
<v Speaker 3>can be reality.</v>

1221
00:55:07.050 --> 00:55:07.720
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>

1222
00:55:07.830 --> 00:55:09.810
<v Speaker 7>it's like a lot of people crafting with </v>
<v Speaker 7>words,</v>

1223
00:55:09.811 --> 00:55:14.811
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>tastes change shit around and that's </v>

1224
00:55:14.811 --> 00:55:14.811
<v Speaker 7>your ass.</v>

1225
00:55:14.811 --> 00:55:17.150
<v Speaker 2>I feel bad for Lindsay Lohan having to </v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with that like every day.</v>

1226
00:55:17.210 --> 00:55:19.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's pretty much what she does </v>
<v Speaker 2>every single day now.</v>

1227
00:55:19.790 --> 00:55:24.790
<v Speaker 2>All the court cases and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did it for like seven months and it </v>

1228
00:55:24.790 --> 00:55:29.291
<v Speaker 2>was like one of the worst times in my </v>
<v Speaker 2>life having to deal with just fucking </v>

1229
00:55:29.291 --> 00:55:29.291
<v Speaker 2>going to court.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having lawyers.</v>

1230
00:55:29.291 --> 00:55:31.200
<v Speaker 2>Didn't you wash it or what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

1231
00:55:31.330 --> 00:55:33.180
<v Speaker 3>there was some shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but if your um,</v>

1232
00:55:33.330 --> 00:55:35.130
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're stuck like that man,</v>

1233
00:55:35.131 --> 00:55:36.130
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're in like a,</v>

1234
00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:39.360
<v Speaker 3>a legal turmoil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That shit will take years off your life.</v>

1235
00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:41.250
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot of stress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1236
00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:42.630
<v Speaker 3>This,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1237
00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:44.670
<v Speaker 3>this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1238
00:55:45.210 --> 00:55:48.180
<v Speaker 3>he was part of the RSS Development </v>
<v Speaker 3>working group,</v>

1239
00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:51.240
<v Speaker 3>coauthored rss one point zero.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1240
00:55:51.241 --> 00:55:52.440
<v Speaker 3>just that alone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

1241
00:55:52.441 --> 00:55:55.320
<v Speaker 3>they should be kissing this guy's ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He shouldn't be rich.</v>

1242
00:55:55.980 --> 00:55:59.650
<v Speaker 3>Whereas bill burr that night though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they got no,</v>

1243
00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:04.760
<v Speaker 3>he didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was arrested by federal authorities </v>

1244
00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:07.941
<v Speaker 3>in connection with systematic </v>
<v Speaker 3>downloading of academic journal </v>

1245
00:56:07.941 --> 00:56:08.070
<v Speaker 3>articles.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's crazy.</v>

1246
00:56:08.071 --> 00:56:09.630
<v Speaker 3>It's so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's academic journal articles.</v>

1247
00:56:09.631 --> 00:56:12.130
<v Speaker 3>I believe those are free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1248
00:56:12.210 --> 00:56:17.210
<v Speaker 3>So he was arrested for providing people </v>
<v Speaker 3>with the ability to download something </v>

1249
00:56:17.911 --> 00:56:21.130
<v Speaker 3>that's already free.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

1250
00:56:21.131 --> 00:56:26.131
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't seem like it makes sense,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he opposed their practice of </v>

1251
00:56:26.131 --> 00:56:29.551
<v Speaker 3>compensating publishers rather than </v>
<v Speaker 3>authors out of the fees that it charges </v>

1252
00:56:29.551 --> 00:56:31.240
<v Speaker 3>to for access to articles.</v>

1253
00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:36.750
<v Speaker 3>So he contended that the j Isto our </v>
<v Speaker 3>fees,</v>

1254
00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:42.880
<v Speaker 3>limited access to academic work produced</v>
<v Speaker 3>at American colleges and universities.</v>

1255
00:56:42.910 --> 00:56:44.470
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's really interesting.</v>

1256
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:49.950
<v Speaker 3>So he pretty much was paying like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the use or the subscriptions to certain </v>

1257
00:56:50.920 --> 00:56:55.120
<v Speaker 3>articles that maybe the school was </v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to sell for a higher price maybe.</v>

1258
00:56:55.330 --> 00:56:57.730
<v Speaker 3>And it's hard to tell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like,</v>

1259
00:56:57.731 --> 00:56:59.680
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Between 1950 and 1980.</v>

1334
01:00:54.790 --> 01:00:56.410
<v Speaker 5>Everybody thought we were going to war </v>
<v Speaker 5>with Cuba,</v>

1342
01:01:19.530 --> 01:01:24.530

<v Speaker 3>like rhinos on rollers and ozone </v>

<v Speaker 3>more ridiculous than yours.</v>

1412
01:04:57.571 --> 01:04:57.820
<v Speaker 3>vintage cars that they clean with a </v>
<v Speaker 3>toothbrush.</v>

1413
01:04:58.550 --> 01:04:59.800
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see what's going on here.</v>

1414
01:04:59.830 --> 01:05:04.830
<v Speaker 3>Can I see what's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>They take care of the other special </v>

1415
01:05:04.830 --> 01:05:08.131
<v Speaker 3>cloth in their pocket that they hope to </v>
<v Speaker 3>get that special cloth out the micro </v>

1416
01:05:10.211 --> 01:05:13.480
<v Speaker 3>cloth and wipe it there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you fuck with cars?</v>

1417
01:05:13.481 --> 01:05:14.920
<v Speaker 3>Is it anything that you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1418
01:05:15.020 --> 01:05:17.200
<v Speaker 3>you fixate on cars?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you like cars?</v>

1419
01:05:17.260 --> 01:05:17.920
<v Speaker 3>Nah.</v>

1420
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:19.930
<v Speaker 7>No it wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I fixate on.</v>

1421
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.310
<v Speaker 7>Is this just jokes really?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And maybe trouble with girls.</v>

1422
01:05:26.530 --> 01:05:28.780
<v Speaker 3>Trouble with girls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He mean relationships.</v>

1423
01:05:28.781 --> 01:05:29.860
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what you're saying.</v>

1424
01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:30.550
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I just,</v>

1425
01:05:30.610 --> 01:05:33.170
<v Speaker 7>I just like any,</v>
<v Speaker 7>any.</v>

1426
01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:36.860
<v Speaker 7>I think most disputes I have with a </v>
<v Speaker 7>woman end up on stage,</v>

1427
01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:38.120
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

1428
01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:41.480
<v Speaker 7>like most of my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like why are you even dealing with these</v>

1429
01:05:41.481 --> 01:05:42.470
<v Speaker 7>pictures?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I said,</v>

1430
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:46.940
<v Speaker 7>because it's material,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's constructive,</v>

1431
01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.440
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

1432
01:05:48.441 --> 01:05:50.900
<v Speaker 7>A lot of comics take that approach.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's what I did.</v>

1433
01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:53.990
<v Speaker 7>That's why I'm going to avn tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Good luck fucker.</v>

1434
01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:55.270
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a lot.</v>

1435
01:05:55.271 --> 01:06:00.271
<v Speaker 3>A lot of comlex take that approach.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to think that he couldn't be </v>

1436
01:06:00.271 --> 01:06:03.671
<v Speaker 3>enlightened in not claiming </v>
<v Speaker 3>enlightenment by any stretch of the </v>

1437
01:06:03.671 --> 01:06:03.671
<v Speaker 3>imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm certainly not enlightened,</v>

1438
01:06:03.671 --> 01:06:07.640
<v Speaker 3>but I used to think that you couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 3>even seek it and be a funny comedian.</v>

1439
01:06:07.970 --> 01:06:08.870
<v Speaker 3>I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1440
01:06:10.010 --> 01:06:12.980
<v Speaker 3>lightened meant seek peace because to be</v>
<v Speaker 3>a comic,</v>

1441
01:06:12.981 --> 01:06:16.240
<v Speaker 3>to me that was like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the idea was always that if you're going</v>

1442
01:06:16.250 --> 01:06:19.640
<v Speaker 3>to be at my favorite kind of comics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there was no peace.</v>

1443
01:06:19.970 --> 01:06:24.970
<v Speaker 3>My favorite kind of complex where </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kennison and hex and prior and you know,</v>

1444
01:06:25.071 --> 01:06:26.600
<v Speaker 3>and the guys from Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1445
01:06:26.601 --> 01:06:27.020
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1446
01:06:27.520 --> 01:06:30.170
<v Speaker 3>the guys that people don't know about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like Steve Sweeney and Don Gavin.</v>

1447
01:06:30.171 --> 01:06:31.090
<v Speaker 3>And so there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there,</v>

1448
01:06:31.091 --> 01:06:33.590
<v Speaker 3>there was a salt comedy and that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>coming out.</v>

1449
01:06:33.591 --> 01:06:34.850
<v Speaker 3>You're beating you over the head with </v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

1450
01:06:34.851 --> 01:06:38.840
<v Speaker 3>There was no sot nom up in this bitch is</v>
<v Speaker 3>crazy comedy.</v>

1451
01:06:38.841 --> 01:06:41.030
<v Speaker 3>So I always thought that like to do that</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of comedy.</v>

1452
01:06:41.450 --> 01:06:45.680
<v Speaker 3>Like you really can't be like trying to </v>
<v Speaker 3>like get your shit together.</v>

1453
01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:48.970
<v Speaker 3>You have to have some cash in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have nothing to talk.</v>

1454
01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:54.240
<v Speaker 7>Well I think the good thing about life,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it'll always bring your chaos no matter </v>

1455
01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:55.370
<v Speaker 7>how peaceful you are.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then being a human,</v>

1456
01:06:55.850 --> 01:06:58.430
<v Speaker 7>you still going to do human shit though,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know better.</v>

1457
01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:04.520
<v Speaker 7>So you know that that's always a but.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But I understand always wanted to keep </v>

1458
01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:09.101
<v Speaker 7>your comedy edge and you probably walked</v>
<v Speaker 7>away from like peace like earlier on </v>

1459
01:07:12.170 --> 01:07:16.220
<v Speaker 7>just because you thought you wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 7>keep it comedy edge but now a little bit</v>

1460
01:07:16.221 --> 01:07:19.640
<v Speaker 7>grown and you're like fuck it,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I can be funny and be peaceful</v>

1461
01:07:19.900 --> 01:07:21.730
<v Speaker 3>a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But it was also like with me,</v>

1462
01:07:21.731 --> 01:07:26.731
<v Speaker 3>it was like a sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a natural process of doing everything </v>

1463
01:07:26.731 --> 01:07:29.620
<v Speaker 3>stupid that you can do to realize,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1464
01:07:29.890 --> 01:07:33.160
<v Speaker 3>well I won't be doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And there's another one.</v>

1465
01:07:33.190 --> 01:07:33.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

1466
01:07:33.780 --> 01:07:36.760
<v Speaker 3>I won't do that one again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then by the time you get to be like,</v>

1467
01:07:36.910 --> 01:07:39.130
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>37 years old or some shit,</v>

1468
01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:39.730
<v Speaker 3>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay,</v>

1469
01:07:39.731 --> 01:07:44.731
<v Speaker 3>I think I've accumulated a pretty good </v>
<v Speaker 3>database of what's gotten me in trouble </v>

1470
01:07:44.731 --> 01:07:46.690
<v Speaker 3>and when it's not gotten me in trouble </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I need to figure out how to navigate</v>

1471
01:07:46.691 --> 01:07:49.370
<v Speaker 3>towards the right hand side of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>equation because this is,</v>

1472
01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:54.680
<v Speaker 3>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucking up my own life by doing </v>

1473
01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:54.680
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this night I'm enjoying it.</v>

1474
01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:55.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do I enjoy?</v>

1475
01:07:55.690 --> 01:07:57.520
<v Speaker 3>And I had to kind of break it down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1476
01:07:57.521 --> 01:07:58.610
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1477
01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:01.500
<v Speaker 3>different activities and enjoy doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>standup.</v>

1478
01:08:01.570 --> 01:08:03.430
<v Speaker 3>And I enjoy hanging out with my comedian</v>
<v Speaker 3>friends.</v>

1479
01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:09.060
<v Speaker 3>What I tell him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>enjoy his girls were telling me that it </v>

1480
01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:10.701
<v Speaker 3>shouldn't hang out with comedians all </v>
<v Speaker 3>the time because they just reinforce </v>

1481
01:08:10.701 --> 01:08:11.530
<v Speaker 3>your opinions and you think that you </v>
<v Speaker 3>know that you're not fucked up,</v>

1482
01:08:11.531 --> 01:08:16.531
<v Speaker 3>but you are fucked up and you're just </v>
<v Speaker 3>hanging around with these comedians and </v>

1483
01:08:16.531 --> 01:08:16.531
<v Speaker 3>they're fucked up too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you're like,</v>

1484
01:08:16.531 --> 01:08:16.531
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

1485
01:08:16.531 --> 01:08:18.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm okay because fucking Ari Shaffir </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinks it's okay.</v>

1486
01:08:18.801 --> 01:08:23.801

1487
01:08:23.801 --> 01:08:25.550
<v Speaker 1>not okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They never even got a chance to say that</v>

1488
01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:31.560
<v Speaker 1>I didn't allow them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Girl tries to talk shit about my </v>

<v Speaker 1>comedian friends shoot talking about </v>

1493
01:08:41.411 --> 01:08:42.230
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

1494
01:08:42.231 --> 01:08:44.950
<v Speaker 1>I got to it instituted no headshots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>policy and no hair,</v>

1497
01:08:48.290 --> 01:08:49.490
<v Speaker 1>None.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of that nonsense.</v>

1498
01:08:49.610 --> 01:08:51.230
<v Speaker 1>Trying to act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We try to do,</v>

1499
01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:53.270
<v Speaker 1>try to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck Outta here.</v>

1500
01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:57.170
<v Speaker 1>Get outta here with half of the chicks </v>
<v Speaker 1>in La.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know what?</v>

1502
01:08:59.001 --> 01:09:01.840
<v Speaker 1>And it's a rude thing to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially because I've had headshots,</v>

1503
01:09:02.210 --> 01:09:03.650
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's ridiculous.</v>

1504
01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:08.680
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can understand you being upset with </v>

1505
01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:08.680
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>

1506
01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:10.870
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm not saying I'm perfect,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm saying as far as like the people</v>

1507
01:09:11.601 --> 01:09:14.390
<v Speaker 1>that I get along with and I can't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>along with other performers.</v>

1508
01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:16.500
<v Speaker 1>It's a Yin Yang sort of a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's.</v>

1509
01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:18.770
<v Speaker 1>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a jealousy thing.</v>

1510
01:09:18.980 --> 01:09:23.980
<v Speaker 1>It's not a selfish thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't like to talk about like </v>

1511
01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:28.130
<v Speaker 1>when me and my wife talk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we never talk about like my comedy,</v>

1512
01:09:28.250 --> 01:09:29.990
<v Speaker 1>like never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell her like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's fucking show was great.</v>

1514
01:09:31.281 --> 01:09:33.050
<v Speaker 1>It was a lot of fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell her that,</v>

1515
01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:35.830
<v Speaker 1>but I don't ever like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

1516
01:09:35.860 --> 01:09:38.990
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to go over the process with</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1517
01:09:38.991 --> 01:09:39.920
<v Speaker 1>I don't need to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

1518
01:09:39.921 --> 01:09:41.240
<v Speaker 1>what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is funny.</v>

1519
01:09:41.241 --> 01:09:43.250
<v Speaker 1>We don't have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any of those conversations.</v>

1520
01:09:43.290 --> 01:09:48.290
<v Speaker 1>None of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's a lot of shit that I would </v>

1521
01:09:48.290 --> 01:09:50.591
<v Speaker 1>say I'm sure that she wouldn't find </v>
<v Speaker 1>funny or that she would think it's </v>

1522
01:09:50.591 --> 01:09:50.591
<v Speaker 1>fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But.</v>

1523
01:09:50.591 --> 01:09:53.810
<v Speaker 1>But I know it's funny to me and the type</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people that I like to hang out with,</v>

1524
01:09:54.170 --> 01:09:54.860
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny,</v>

1525
01:09:54.861 --> 01:09:58.430
<v Speaker 1>if it makes me laugh when you're dating </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone that tries to kill him,</v>

1526
01:09:58.431 --> 01:09:59.870
<v Speaker 1>that undermine that.</v>

1527
01:10:00.090 --> 01:10:00.900
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

1528
01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:06.030
<v Speaker 7>and that's why I'm single like cars.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You find that happen.</v>

1529
01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:12.790
<v Speaker 7>What is it all just a woman saying if </v>
<v Speaker 7>you say something that you would </v>

1530
01:10:12.790 --> 01:10:14.100
<v Speaker 7>normally say to a point and they say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's not funny.</v>

1531
01:10:14.490 --> 01:10:16.080
<v Speaker 7>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't have to be funny every minute.</v>

1532
01:10:16.180 --> 01:10:17.640
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>And if I'm not funny,</v>

1533
01:10:17.641 --> 01:10:20.310
<v Speaker 7>I don't need you to tell me that I hang </v>
<v Speaker 7>out with people like,</v>

1534
01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:22.290
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so what are you doing?</v>

1535
01:10:22.350 --> 01:10:23.340
<v Speaker 7>Like.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And by the way,</v>

1536
01:10:23.341 --> 01:10:25.920
<v Speaker 7>sometimes you miss,</v>
<v Speaker 7>sometimes you miss and that's the,</v>

1537
01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:29.550
<v Speaker 7>that's the game.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But nobody's out there keeping score.</v>

1538
01:10:29.551 --> 01:10:33.600
<v Speaker 7>And then in like pounded in you that you</v>
<v Speaker 7>had an unfunny moment with them,</v>

1539
01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:35.550
<v Speaker 7>especially after you just made them </v>
<v Speaker 7>laugh.</v>

1540
01:10:35.710 --> 01:10:37.200
<v Speaker 7>Like what's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what is your problem?</v>

1541
01:10:37.510 --> 01:10:42.510
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much lack of understanding do you </v>

1542
01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:42.510
<v Speaker 1>know about the human condition?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1543
01:10:42.510 --> 01:10:44.050
<v Speaker 1>you never said something that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought was funny and it wasn't.</v>

1544
01:10:44.230 --> 01:10:45.220
<v Speaker 1>That's like part of life.</v>

1545
01:10:45.550 --> 01:10:47.490
<v Speaker 7>And then some of them girls cheat when </v>
<v Speaker 7>it comes to funny,</v>

1546
01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:50.890
<v Speaker 7>like they'll say something and they'll </v>
<v Speaker 7>laugh and I said I had just clowns.</v>

1547
01:10:50.891 --> 01:10:55.390
<v Speaker 7>You pitch,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can't determine that.</v>

1548
01:10:55.391 --> 01:11:00.391
<v Speaker 7>It's funny because you said I have to be</v>
<v Speaker 7>laughing too.</v>

1549
01:11:01.140 --> 01:11:06.140
<v Speaker 7>That is funny.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Or I or when they try to give you a bit </v>

1550
01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:07.160
<v Speaker 7>like that's funny you should say that on</v>
<v Speaker 7>stage sometime.</v>

1551
01:11:07.190 --> 01:11:10.390
<v Speaker 7>Ever had that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>My mom does that.</v>

1552
01:11:10.770 --> 01:11:13.090
<v Speaker 7>But do you know sometimes a woman will </v>
<v Speaker 7>say something</v>

1553
01:11:14.990 --> 01:11:18.840
<v Speaker 3>and sometimes I'll be like mad that they</v>
<v Speaker 3>said something funny to help me.</v>

1554
01:11:21.550 --> 01:11:22.560
<v Speaker 3>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's funny.</v>

1555
01:11:22.561 --> 01:11:24.810
<v Speaker 3>Like she gives you some pointers and </v>
<v Speaker 3>they work shit.</v>

1556
01:11:25.370 --> 01:11:30.370
<v Speaker 3>That is fucking funny you like because </v>
<v Speaker 3>you just want to take it from you where </v>

1557
01:11:30.370 --> 01:11:31.170
<v Speaker 3>you want to take it from.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes.</v>

1558
01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:31.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>

1559
01:11:31.981 --> 01:11:34.220
<v Speaker 3>But you can get some good pointers even </v>
<v Speaker 3>from idiots.</v>

1560
01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:37.050
<v Speaker 3>You can get some good pointers from </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that you don't even respect.</v>

1561
01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:37.910
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1562
01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:39.240
<v Speaker 3>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've had that happen.</v>

1563
01:11:39.241 --> 01:11:41.610
<v Speaker 3>I've had someone given me some good </v>
<v Speaker 3>advice once.</v>

1564
01:11:41.940 --> 01:11:44.360
<v Speaker 3>I didn't want to hear it at all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guy was an idiot now.</v>

1565
01:11:44.361 --> 01:11:45.660
<v Speaker 3>Like did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gave me good advice,</v>

1566
01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:50.520
<v Speaker 3>he gave it to me into a tape recorder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was hanging out with another comedian</v>

1567
01:11:50.521 --> 01:11:54.780
<v Speaker 3>friend of mine and I had a tape recorder</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I put a tape recorder down and I was</v>

1568
01:11:54.781 --> 01:11:59.781
<v Speaker 3>recording my set and this dude picked up</v>
<v Speaker 3>a tape recorder and was given me notes </v>

1569
01:11:59.781 --> 01:12:00.930
<v Speaker 3>on the tape recorder.</v>

1570
01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.480
<v Speaker 3>You feel like you're taking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking too much about sex.</v>

1571
01:12:03.730 --> 01:12:05.190
<v Speaker 3>You're repeating yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

1572
01:12:05.191 --> 01:12:07.300
<v Speaker 3>you're the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he said that like on,</v>

1573
01:12:07.410 --> 01:12:12.410
<v Speaker 3>on the recording.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wish I saved it because she was like,</v>

1574
01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:13.140
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

1575
01:12:13.141 --> 01:12:14.020
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a long,</v>

1576
01:12:14.130 --> 01:12:14.910
<v Speaker 3>long,</v>
<v Speaker 3>long,</v>

1577
01:12:14.911 --> 01:12:18.120
<v Speaker 3>long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This was probably like 1991 or something</v>

1578
01:12:18.121 --> 01:12:23.121
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was GRANDPA's on Staten Island and </v>

1579
01:12:23.121 --> 01:12:25.140
<v Speaker 3>the dude was talking into my recorder </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm like,</v>

1580
01:12:25.141 --> 01:12:25.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look man,</v>

1581
01:12:25.890 --> 01:12:28.350
<v Speaker 3>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want your fucking opinion.</v>

1582
01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:30.570
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't need detail.</v>

1583
01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:32.240
<v Speaker 3>I didn't ask you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't need to talk to them.</v>

1584
01:12:32.290 --> 01:12:37.290
<v Speaker 3>This is for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This recording is for me so I can go </v>

1585
01:12:37.290 --> 01:12:37.290
<v Speaker 3>over my shit and decide what I think </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it.</v>

1586
01:12:37.290 --> 01:12:37.700
<v Speaker 3>So violation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1587
01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:40.230
<v Speaker 3>Not that I hear your voice saying what I</v>
<v Speaker 3>would.</v>

1588
01:12:40.320 --> 01:12:45.320
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it wasn't a good set.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't have a good set because I think</v>

1589
01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:47.940
<v Speaker 3>I'm fucked up the order of material or </v>
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>

1590
01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:50.340
<v Speaker 3>There was some sort of error there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was right.</v>

1591
01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:52.080
<v Speaker 3>Like what he sat on the recording was </v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1592
01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:57.140
<v Speaker 3>Like he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like you're talking too much about this </v>

1593
01:12:57.140 --> 01:12:57.140
<v Speaker 3>and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you repeating yourself.</v>

1594
01:12:57.140 --> 01:12:58.650
<v Speaker 3>He's right because I fucked up one of my</v>
<v Speaker 3>bits or something.</v>

1595
01:12:58.651 --> 01:13:02.240
<v Speaker 3>Whatever I did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew that this asshole and that's like</v>

1596
01:13:02.900 --> 01:13:04.320
<v Speaker 3>the worst.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He gave me.</v>

1597
01:13:04.321 --> 01:13:05.500
<v Speaker 3>Good advice though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was,</v>

1598
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:08.220
<v Speaker 3>it was really good advice from a </v>
<v Speaker 3>douchebag that shouldn't have been given</v>

1599
01:13:08.221 --> 01:13:12.360
<v Speaker 3>advice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can accept that shit from people.</v>

1600
01:13:12.361 --> 01:13:17.040
<v Speaker 3>But I've been in relationships with </v>
<v Speaker 3>people that like all they do,</v>

1601
01:13:17.041 --> 01:13:22.041
<v Speaker 3>like if you dated someone who's trying </v>
<v Speaker 3>to be an act or something like that at </v>

1602
01:13:22.041 --> 01:13:24.830
<v Speaker 3>all they do is talk about acting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All they do is talk about that and </v>

1603
01:13:25.531 --> 01:13:26.630
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And they'll like,</v>

1604
01:13:26.670 --> 01:13:30.540
<v Speaker 3>they'll like fake talk to you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's almost like they're talking to</v>

1605
01:13:30.541 --> 01:13:33.200
<v Speaker 3>you and this is one of the weirdest </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that an actor will do.</v>

1606
01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:38.560
<v Speaker 3>They're talking to you and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretending like they be talking to </v>

1607
01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:40.860
<v Speaker 3>someone in an interview,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so they're talking to you,</v>

1608
01:13:41.050 --> 01:13:45.540
<v Speaker 3>but they're talking crazy bullshit like </v>
<v Speaker 3>talking to me and like,</v>

1609
01:13:45.541 --> 01:13:46.980
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what'd you think of the movie?</v>

1610
01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:50.850
<v Speaker 3>I thought her performance was stunning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like there.</v>

1611
01:13:52.170 --> 01:13:57.170
<v Speaker 3>I thought she was amazing and I thought </v>
<v Speaker 3>it was really powerful the way it was </v>

1612
01:13:57.661 --> 01:13:59.850
<v Speaker 3>presented.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I felt like it was like,</v>

1613
01:13:59.851 --> 01:14:03.030
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck are you saying?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who are you talking to you?</v>

1614
01:14:03.031 --> 01:14:08.031
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could tell that this was like some </v>

1615
01:14:08.031 --> 01:14:10.730
<v Speaker 3>weird speech because there's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a mantra that gets chanted </v>

1616
01:14:11.501 --> 01:14:12.280
<v Speaker 3>whenever anything</v>

1617
01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:17.280
<v Speaker 1>is successful in Hollywood and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that want to be successful as </v>

1618
01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:17.420
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll go along with the.</v>

1619
01:14:17.421 --> 01:14:18.910
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

1620
01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:24.060
<v Speaker 1>This is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like whoever's good is it Daniel Day </v>

1621
01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:24.060
<v Speaker 1>Lewis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daniel Day,</v>

1622
01:14:24.060 --> 01:14:27.330
<v Speaker 1>Lewis and Lewis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then everybody will chant that </v>

1623
01:14:27.330 --> 01:14:29.530
<v Speaker 1>mantra and it gets to a point where you </v>
<v Speaker 1>see people repeating these mantras,</v>

1624
01:14:29.550 --> 01:14:31.120
<v Speaker 1>patterns and conversations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1625
01:14:31.540 --> 01:14:36.540
<v Speaker 1>Like it was an amazing film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The powerful portrayal just shone light </v>

1626
01:14:36.581 --> 01:14:39.010
<v Speaker 1>on that time period in a way that's in </v>
<v Speaker 1>escapable.</v>

1627
01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:39.930
<v Speaker 1>Like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the,</v>

1628
01:14:40.060 --> 01:14:42.670
<v Speaker 1>there's shit in the way they're talking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're like,</v>

1629
01:14:42.671 --> 01:14:45.310
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not really talking,</v>

1630
01:14:45.450 --> 01:14:50.450
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're just using talking points that </v>

1631
01:14:50.450 --> 01:14:52.651
<v Speaker 1>all these other actors in your acting </v>
<v Speaker 1>class or saying they're all talking </v>

1632
01:14:52.651 --> 01:14:52.651
<v Speaker 1>crazy talk.</v>

1633
01:14:52.651 --> 01:14:56.820
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's funny like Hollywood is the only </v>

1634
01:14:56.820 --> 01:14:56.820
<v Speaker 7>place where everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Maybe it happens other places,</v>

1635
01:14:56.820 --> 01:15:01.591
<v Speaker 7>but like everybody like kind of has,</v>
<v Speaker 7>its not,</v>

1636
01:15:02.160 --> 01:15:03.940
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how style set trends,</v>

1637
01:15:03.941 --> 01:15:06.310
<v Speaker 7>but there's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's personality trends.</v>

1638
01:15:06.380 --> 01:15:10.030
<v Speaker 7>Like there was a time and I think people</v>
<v Speaker 7>still didn't like don't say that.</v>

1639
01:15:10.031 --> 01:15:14.440
<v Speaker 7>That's negative.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like how the fuck is that negative?</v>

1640
01:15:14.500 --> 01:15:16.960
<v Speaker 7>Like you'll say something and just </v>
<v Speaker 7>because.</v>

1641
01:15:17.050 --> 01:15:19.480
<v Speaker 7>Because it's real because it's real,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's negative,</v>

1642
01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:24.520
<v Speaker 7>it's real,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and a lot of times it's negative to not </v>

1643
01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:24.520
<v Speaker 7>say it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And that's what I'm saying.</v>

1644
01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:25.780
<v Speaker 7>That's why I always tell people,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well I'm so negative,</v>

1645
01:15:25.781 --> 01:15:27.610
<v Speaker 7>I'm positive that shit.</v>

1646
01:15:28.050 --> 01:15:33.050
<v Speaker 1>It's negative to not point out negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>things because you're not contributing </v>

1647
01:15:33.050 --> 01:15:36.651
<v Speaker 1>to fixing any problem that might exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That could be correctable if someone </v>

1648
01:15:36.651 --> 01:15:37.770
<v Speaker 1>would address what the fuck is going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1649
01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:40.440
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that don't be negative shit.</v>

1650
01:15:40.441 --> 01:15:41.190
<v Speaker 1>That was a big one for me.</v>

1651
01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:46.200
<v Speaker 7>That was a big one for a while.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He used to bug me and a is always </v>

1652
01:15:46.200 --> 01:15:48.531
<v Speaker 7>something or or just to the illegal use </v>
<v Speaker 7>of the word like me and Patricia talks </v>

1653
01:15:48.531 --> 01:15:48.531
<v Speaker 7>like I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>hey,</v>

1654
01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:53.780
<v Speaker 7>you can't say haters.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like if you disagree with somebody or </v>

1655
01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:57.581
<v Speaker 7>you're a hater,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what happened to when you could just </v>

1656
01:15:57.581 --> 01:15:57.581
<v Speaker 7>disagree,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1657
01:15:57.581 --> 01:16:01.380
<v Speaker 7>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and not be a heater like so I have to </v>

1658
01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:01.380
<v Speaker 7>have your opinion on this.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm a hater.</v>

1659
01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:02.080
<v Speaker 7>Exactly.</v>

1660
01:16:02.470 --> 01:16:02.920
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

1661
01:16:02.921 --> 01:16:04.930
<v Speaker 1>and there's also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's the thing.</v>

1662
01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:09.960
<v Speaker 1>This is a way to express opinions in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>respectful way and some people don't do </v>

1663
01:16:10.571 --> 01:16:11.710
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people,</v>

1664
01:16:11.740 --> 01:16:16.740
<v Speaker 1>if they disagree with you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do it in like they try to discount </v>

1665
01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:20.251
<v Speaker 1>your point and like an insulting way and</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't been to.</v>

1666
01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:27.020
<v Speaker 1>I think we all have been,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's one of the hardest things </v>

1667
01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:29.440
<v Speaker 1>about accepting contrary ideas is a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of times is the way they're presented.</v>

1668
01:16:29.770 --> 01:16:32.050
<v Speaker 1>If someone has a different point of view</v>
<v Speaker 1>than you,</v>

1669
01:16:32.051 --> 01:16:35.170
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's like a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a hot button topic,</v>

1670
01:16:35.510 --> 01:16:38.620
<v Speaker 1>global warming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you sit down with the wrong motherfucker</v>

1671
01:16:38.621 --> 01:16:40.990
<v Speaker 1>and talk about global warming and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>will insult you.</v>

1672
01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:43.480
<v Speaker 1>They will find a way to to figure out </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

1673
01:16:43.720 --> 01:16:45.010
<v Speaker 1>what side are you on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

1674
01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:46.170
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

1675
01:16:46.230 --> 01:16:51.230
<v Speaker 1>if you're a Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most likely you're siding with big </v>

1676
01:16:51.230 --> 01:16:51.230
<v Speaker 1>business and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1677
01:16:51.230 --> 01:16:51.230
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

1678
01:16:51.230 --> 01:16:56.010
<v Speaker 1>The trends have shown that global </v>
<v Speaker 1>warming is a natural cycle is repeated </v>

1679
01:16:56.010 --> 01:16:57.310
<v Speaker 1>by the guy and they just repeat those </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking points.</v>

1680
01:16:57.580 --> 01:17:02.580
<v Speaker 1>Or if you're someone who's a Democrat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very likely you will get emotional </v>

1681
01:17:02.580 --> 01:17:06.781
<v Speaker 1>and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you think it's okay to fuck up this </v>

1682
01:17:06.781 --> 01:17:06.781
<v Speaker 1>earth and fuck it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For my children.</v>

1683
01:17:06.781 --> 01:17:08.370
<v Speaker 1>I think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's,</v>

1684
01:17:08.530 --> 01:17:11.300
<v Speaker 1>there's that point of view like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people that are extreme ecologist,</v>

1685
01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:14.900
<v Speaker 1>we need to all go vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to all grow our own vegetables.</v>

1686
01:17:16.010 --> 01:17:17.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't know who's right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1687
01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:17.770
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

1688
01:17:17.771 --> 01:17:19.220
<v Speaker 1>I'm not neither one of those fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

1689
01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:24.760
<v Speaker 1>But people fall into categories for real</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy and sometimes it's hard to find </v>

1690
01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:31.660
<v Speaker 1>like a real person and the real opinion </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a real point of view in the hot </v>

1691
01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:36.071
<v Speaker 1>button topics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like whenever you got you talking about </v>

1692
01:17:36.071 --> 01:17:36.071
<v Speaker 1>rape or you're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1693
01:17:36.071 --> 01:17:37.280
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the environment,</v>

1694
01:17:37.490 --> 01:17:39.680
<v Speaker 1>violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gun control,</v>

1695
01:17:39.681 --> 01:17:41.520
<v Speaker 1>you're talking about gun control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just get to.</v>

1696
01:17:44.540 --> 01:17:46.250
<v Speaker 7>I was just thinking about the gun </v>
<v Speaker 7>control thing.</v>

1697
01:17:46.460 --> 01:17:47.210
<v Speaker 7>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So let me,</v>

1698
01:17:47.300 --> 01:17:48.380
<v Speaker 7>let me ask what you're thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 7>this.</v>

1699
01:17:48.381 --> 01:17:53.381
<v Speaker 7>So yesterday I tweeted that a stoney </v>
<v Speaker 7>hook is the NRI and an Nras 9:11,</v>

1700
01:17:58.250 --> 01:18:03.250
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Because there's like conspiracy </v>

1701
01:18:03.250 --> 01:18:03.250
<v Speaker 7>theorists,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1702
01:18:03.250 --> 01:18:03.530
<v Speaker 7>They're saying that it was staged,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>

1703
01:18:03.531 --> 01:18:05.770
<v Speaker 7>I've seen that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So video.</v>

1704
01:18:05.771 --> 01:18:07.910
<v Speaker 7>Fuck is that all about.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm like,</v>

1705
01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:09.980
<v Speaker 7>is that someone please someone debunk </v>
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>

1706
01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:13.040
<v Speaker 7>It's got to be a debunked sandy hook </v>
<v Speaker 7>thing.</v>

1707
01:18:13.790 --> 01:18:16.220
<v Speaker 7>Somebody sent me the video,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I was looking at that shit.</v>

1708
01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:21.430
<v Speaker 7>And then they were,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they were pointing out how the media </v>

1709
01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:24.530
<v Speaker 7>story changed as the story of Stony </v>
<v Speaker 7>Brook became,</v>

1710
01:18:24.770 --> 01:18:28.280
<v Speaker 7>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But to me it's like one of the things in</v>

1711
01:18:28.281 --> 01:18:32.480
<v Speaker 7>the video was they said there were two </v>
<v Speaker 7>shooters and they chased the guy through</v>

1712
01:18:32.481 --> 01:18:34.520
<v Speaker 7>the woods and then.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But to me it's like,</v>

1713
01:18:34.730 --> 01:18:37.310
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the guy who's making a video,</v>

1714
01:18:37.490 --> 01:18:42.490
<v Speaker 7>like when a story first breaks,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there's gonna be differences in the </v>

1715
01:18:42.490 --> 01:18:44.810
<v Speaker 7>story until they figure out what really,</v>
<v Speaker 7>really happened.</v>

1716
01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:46.040
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1717
01:18:46.041 --> 01:18:49.670
<v Speaker 7>So that I only watched like half and I </v>
<v Speaker 7>got to finish watching the rest of it.</v>

1718
01:18:49.671 --> 01:18:50.990
<v Speaker 7>But so far it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>yeah,</v>

1719
01:18:50.991 --> 01:18:54.500
<v Speaker 7>they was inconsistency in the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but that's because it's the beginning.</v>

1720
01:18:54.820 --> 01:18:57.980
<v Speaker 7>Like later on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then they had the father,</v>

1721
01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:03.160
<v Speaker 7>the father of emily who did his speech </v>
<v Speaker 7>and it was a great speech about his </v>

1722
01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:03.950
<v Speaker 7>daughter.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And uh,</v>

1723
01:19:04.790 --> 01:19:05.480
<v Speaker 7>he went up</v>

1724
01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:07.270
<v Speaker 1>and they were making it seem like he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>faking it.</v>

1725
01:19:07.280 --> 01:19:09.210
<v Speaker 1>Like he was faking the speech.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen man,</v>

1726
01:19:09.211 --> 01:19:14.211
<v Speaker 1>you got into,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you imagine how bad it would make that </v>

1727
01:19:14.211 --> 01:19:15.660
<v Speaker 1>guy feel if his daughter was murdered by</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cycle.</v>

1728
01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:18.450
<v Speaker 1>And then people accused him of lying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1729
01:19:18.660 --> 01:19:22.230
<v Speaker 1>And then based on what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Based on you looking at him,</v>

1730
01:19:22.260 --> 01:19:25.080
<v Speaker 1>talking where he smiled a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>before he talked.</v>

1731
01:19:25.410 --> 01:19:28.890
<v Speaker 1>People deal with grief very differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people bawl their eyes out,</v>

1732
01:19:28.891 --> 01:19:31.770
<v Speaker 1>some people joke around about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then just get it home and sit in the</v>

1733
01:19:31.771 --> 01:19:34.110
<v Speaker 1>fucking dark and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and cry by themselves.</v>

1734
01:19:34.111 --> 01:19:34.860
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who,</v>

1735
01:19:35.460 --> 01:19:39.390
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck knows how you would react </v>
<v Speaker 1>if your baby got shot down like that?</v>

1736
01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:44.460
<v Speaker 1>That'd be so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for all these so called experts to </v>

1737
01:19:44.850 --> 01:19:48.330
<v Speaker 1>be so insensitive when you're dealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with something so horrific.</v>

1738
01:19:48.420 --> 01:19:48.600
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1739
01:19:49.410 --> 01:19:51.400
<v Speaker 7>So the crazy thing is it's more fucked </v>
<v Speaker 7>up.</v>

1740
01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:54.550
<v Speaker 7>Like the video is more fucked up than </v>
<v Speaker 7>the shooting.</v>

1741
01:19:54.610 --> 01:19:58.270
<v Speaker 7>Like you think the shooter was crazy for</v>
<v Speaker 7>you to make this video.</v>

1742
01:19:58.540 --> 01:19:59.750
<v Speaker 7>That's fucking.</v>

1743
01:20:00.020 --> 01:20:02.180
<v Speaker 1>He's got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is my opinion that you got.</v>

1744
01:20:02.181 --> 01:20:03.680
<v Speaker 1>If you're going to say something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1745
01:20:03.710 --> 01:20:08.710
<v Speaker 1>you got to be really fucking chore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're saying that someone's faking </v>

1746
01:20:08.710 --> 01:20:09.450
<v Speaker 1>and their daughter wasn't really killed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're just an actor,</v>

1747
01:20:09.780 --> 01:20:12.000
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you better fucking go and do the work.</v>

1748
01:20:12.030 --> 01:20:17.030
<v Speaker 1>You better had photos of this guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where you see him in the production of </v>

1749
01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:20.421
<v Speaker 1>hamlet and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is real fucking name and this is </v>

1750
01:20:20.421 --> 01:20:23.391
<v Speaker 1>where he lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't just speculate and say it </v>

1751
01:20:23.391 --> 01:20:23.391
<v Speaker 1>doesn't look like he's sad.</v>

1752
01:20:23.391 --> 01:20:24.420
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's crazy.</v>

1753
01:20:24.510 --> 01:20:29.510
<v Speaker 7>Or what about that guy that found all </v>
<v Speaker 7>those kids at the end of his driveway </v>

1754
01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:32.421
<v Speaker 7>and then just like took him inside and </v>
<v Speaker 7>hung out with them and he's getting </v>

1755
01:20:32.421 --> 01:20:34.050
<v Speaker 7>harassed and his story's changing too.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

1756
01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:34.860
<v Speaker 7>he,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he said,</v>

1757
01:20:34.861 --> 01:20:35.820
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I didn't hear that.</v>

1758
01:20:35.821 --> 01:20:37.590
<v Speaker 7>It's the only thing that bothers me </v>
<v Speaker 7>about his story.</v>

1759
01:20:37.591 --> 01:20:41.090
<v Speaker 7>So they say this guy is a hero because </v>
<v Speaker 7>he came outside,</v>

1760
01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:46.140
<v Speaker 7>there was six kids on his lawn and he </v>
<v Speaker 7>took them in his house and gave them </v>

1761
01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:49.941
<v Speaker 7>toys and kept them safe.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But when he found than they will with a </v>

1762
01:20:49.941 --> 01:20:51.540
<v Speaker 7>bus driver who took them away from the </v>
<v Speaker 7>scene.</v>

1763
01:20:51.870 --> 01:20:54.120
<v Speaker 7>So why isn't the bus driver hero?</v>
<v Speaker 7>But then you know,</v>

1764
01:20:54.121 --> 01:20:56.540
<v Speaker 7>he's crying about the kids and cool,</v>
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>

1765
01:20:56.541 --> 01:20:56.940
<v Speaker 7>this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this,</v>

1766
01:20:56.941 --> 01:21:01.941
<v Speaker 7>that's just a moot point.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So then now the conspiracy theories or </v>

1767
01:21:01.941 --> 01:21:03.230
<v Speaker 7>hitting him and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

1768
01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:06.240
<v Speaker 7>his story changed at first it wasn't a </v>
<v Speaker 7>bus driver or something like that.</v>

1769
01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:10.940
<v Speaker 7>You can't rely on people when people say</v>
<v Speaker 7>the story changes and plus you didn't.</v>

1770
01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:12.780
<v Speaker 7>It doesn't change.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It just.</v>

1771
01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:14.310
<v Speaker 7>It's just you don't know what's going </v>
<v Speaker 7>on.</v>

1772
01:21:14.330 --> 01:21:19.330
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How many times have you told a bad </v>

1773
01:21:19.330 --> 01:21:21.741
<v Speaker 7>store?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You remember you have ever said </v>

1774
01:21:21.741 --> 01:21:21.741
<v Speaker 7>something and someone will say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>

1775
01:21:21.741 --> 01:21:21.741
<v Speaker 7>no,</v>
<v Speaker 7>no.</v>

1776
01:21:21.741 --> 01:21:22.570
<v Speaker 7>We were in Phoenix.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh yeah,</v>

1777
01:21:23.050 --> 01:21:25.030
<v Speaker 7>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That happens all the time.</v>

1778
01:21:25.070 --> 01:21:30.070
<v Speaker 7>They get you in court.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's why prosecutors like he changed </v>

1779
01:21:30.070 --> 01:21:30.320
<v Speaker 7>his story soon because first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you asked.</v>

1780
01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:31.890
<v Speaker 7>I didn't even know what the fuck you was</v>
<v Speaker 7>asking me.</v>

1781
01:21:32.190 --> 01:21:32.590
<v Speaker 7>It's like</v>

1782
01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:38.410
<v Speaker 1>testimony is notoriously unreliable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Notoriously it doesn't.</v>

1783
01:21:38.570 --> 01:21:41.090
<v Speaker 1>The people see the shit that didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really happen.</v>

1784
01:21:41.091 --> 01:21:43.520
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they freak out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they hear things,</v>

1785
01:21:43.521 --> 01:21:45.440
<v Speaker 1>they repeat the things they heard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those things become.</v>

1786
01:21:45.441 --> 01:21:47.900
<v Speaker 1>Gossip becomes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It Becomes Gospel,</v>

1787
01:21:47.901 --> 01:21:48.360
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1788
01:21:48.361 --> 01:21:48.710
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

1789
01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:50.930
<v Speaker 1>There are three shooters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three shooters in the building.</v>

1790
01:21:51.480 --> 01:21:52.160
<v Speaker 7>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 7>No.</v>

1791
01:21:52.161 --> 01:21:53.190
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how do you know?</v>

1792
01:21:54.090 --> 01:21:59.090
<v Speaker 7>How do they got the one guy?</v>
<v Speaker 7>You see the one guy go in and start </v>

1793
01:21:59.090 --> 01:21:59.090
<v Speaker 7>shooting people?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Did you watch the whole thing?</v>

1794
01:21:59.090 --> 01:22:03.210
<v Speaker 7>If you didn't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>then you don't know that there's only </v>

1795
01:22:03.210 --> 01:22:03.210
<v Speaker 7>one guy when you the police and you get </v>
<v Speaker 7>there,</v>

1796
01:22:03.210 --> 01:22:04.500
<v Speaker 7>the only thing you know is every shoot </v>
<v Speaker 7>is in the building.</v>

1797
01:22:04.530 --> 01:22:06.360
<v Speaker 7>And the people that met the shit of </v>
<v Speaker 7>dead.</v>

1798
01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:07.950
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And the people had escaped.</v>

1799
01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:10.190
<v Speaker 7>They were trying to run for their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So you try like,</v>

1800
01:22:10.700 --> 01:22:15.700
<v Speaker 7>how do you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't know what the fuck is going </v>

1801
01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:15.700
<v Speaker 7>on,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what the fuck is going?</v>

1802
01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:15.700
<v Speaker 7>You don't know what the fuck is going on</v>
<v Speaker 7>either.</v>

1803
01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:16.020
<v Speaker 7>You don't know who's doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

1804
01:22:16.110 --> 01:22:19.470
<v Speaker 7>And I and I know that I'm unreliable </v>
<v Speaker 7>like this.</v>

1805
01:22:19.471 --> 01:22:24.471
<v Speaker 7>Things that I thought I remembered the </v>
<v Speaker 7>way they went and later on realize that </v>

1806
01:22:24.471 --> 01:22:25.290
<v Speaker 7>they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And I have to come to terms with that.</v>

1807
01:22:25.610 --> 01:22:28.800
<v Speaker 7>Like Damn my memory is not as great as I</v>
<v Speaker 7>thought it was.</v>

1808
01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:34.240
<v Speaker 1>What's really scary that people think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the government would be so corrupt </v>

1809
01:22:34.240 --> 01:22:39.131
<v Speaker 1>that they'd be willing to either murder </v>
<v Speaker 1>kids or there's no real murders,</v>

1810
01:22:39.741 --> 01:22:41.300
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they think that they could pull this</v>

1811
01:22:41.301 --> 01:22:46.301
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I've heard those two conspiracies </v>

1812
01:22:46.301 --> 01:22:47.630
<v Speaker 1>that someone is hired and this is all to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take our guns away.</v>

1813
01:22:47.710 --> 01:22:49.770
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then the idea is that in,</v>

1814
01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:54.780
<v Speaker 1>in doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're going to do is they're </v>

1815
01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:56.000
<v Speaker 1>going to get people so freaked out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're gonna be able to disarm them and</v>

1816
01:22:56.001 --> 01:22:58.580
<v Speaker 1>then the tyrannical governments going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take over.</v>

1817
01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:01.160
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really weird.</v>

1818
01:23:01.550 --> 01:23:04.600
<v Speaker 7>Were these kids in a petri dish?</v>
<v Speaker 7>They started at seven years ago.</v>

1819
01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:05.670
<v Speaker 7>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like</v>

1820
01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:11.480
<v Speaker 3>something terrence parents went on </v>
<v Speaker 3>television and talked about their </v>

1821
01:23:11.480 --> 01:23:12.580
<v Speaker 3>children's not like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what I mean?</v>

1822
01:23:12.581 --> 01:23:14.210
<v Speaker 3>Like actual human beings.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>

1823
01:23:14.380 --> 01:23:19.380
<v Speaker 3>you cannot have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this doesn't even exist in </v>

1824
01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:19.380
<v Speaker 3>Connecticut.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She just put it in my head.</v>

1825
01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:23.350
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing's a big CIA plot.</v>

<v Speaker 3>doing it.</v>

01:28:08.931 --> 01:28:13.931
<v Speaker 3>That was a good fighter.</v>

01:28:13.931 --> 01:28:18.071
<v Speaker 3>didn't have hecklers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like if you're going to make a </v>

1932
01:28:18.071 --> 01:28:19.070
<v Speaker 3>heckler movie and talk about heckling,</v>

1934
01:28:20.241 --> 01:28:23.540

<v Speaker 3>It was more critics and hecklers,</v>

1935
01:28:25.060 --> 01:28:26.210
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1938
01:28:30.981 --> 01:28:35.981
<v Speaker 3>gave him bad reviews,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's nothing wrong with someone </v>

1939
01:28:35.981 --> 01:28:35.981
<v Speaker 3>giving you a bad review.</v>

1940
01:28:35.981 --> 01:28:39.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean everybody's got different tastes </v>
<v Speaker 3>and his standup's not the strongest in </v>

1941
01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:39.280
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's like,</v>

1942
01:28:39.470 --> 01:28:41.000
<v Speaker 3>what are you trying to say?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1943
01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:42.390
<v Speaker 3>the.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it,</v>

1944
01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:44.540
<v Speaker 3>is it a review thing or is it a heckle </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing?</v>

1945
01:28:44.541 --> 01:28:49.541
<v Speaker 3>Because the problem with heckling is </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're interrupting a performance and </v>

1946
01:28:49.541 --> 01:28:50.000
<v Speaker 3>you're being rude and you think that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you're bad ass and you know,</v>

1947
01:28:50.001 --> 01:28:51.830
<v Speaker 3>you think you're funnier than the show </v>
<v Speaker 3>and so you,</v>

1948
01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:53.450
<v Speaker 3>that's us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're,</v>

1949
01:28:53.520 --> 01:28:57.710
<v Speaker 3>you're fucking up the whole agreement </v>
<v Speaker 3>that an audience has with a performer.</v>

1950
01:28:57.980 --> 01:29:02.980
<v Speaker 3>You know when you're sitting in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>audience and you're watching a bad </v>

1951
01:29:02.980 --> 01:29:02.980
<v Speaker 3>comedian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can yell at him</v>

1952
01:29:02.980 --> 01:29:06.440
<v Speaker 1>and fucking and kill if you want it to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you would never do that because it's</v>

1953
01:29:06.630 --> 01:29:08.250
<v Speaker 1>an agreement when you're in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>audience,</v>

1954
01:29:08.490 --> 01:29:10.140
<v Speaker 1>you'd behave as an audience member </v>
<v Speaker 1>would.</v>

1955
01:29:10.350 --> 01:29:15.350
<v Speaker 1>When you're on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do your fucking act and if you </v>

1956
01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:15.350
<v Speaker 1>hackle your account,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really that simple.</v>

1957
01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:16.800
<v Speaker 1>That's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole formula.</v>

1958
01:29:17.130 --> 01:29:21.090
<v Speaker 1>The only time it's not bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's when someone's doing it.</v>

1959
01:29:21.091 --> 01:29:26.091
<v Speaker 1>Good naturedly they got a couple of </v>
<v Speaker 1>drinks and I'm gonna yell something out </v>

1960
01:29:26.091 --> 01:29:26.220
<v Speaker 1>and it might be funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing wrong with that.</v>

1961
01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:31.340
<v Speaker 1>It's when someone is like intentionally </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking with you or insulting you and </v>

1962
01:29:31.340 --> 01:29:33.240
<v Speaker 1>trying to throw you off of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance,</v>

1963
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:35.850
<v Speaker 1>trying to stop you or demanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention,</v>

1964
01:29:35.851 --> 01:29:37.650
<v Speaker 1>unwanted attention for themselves.</v>

1965
01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:42.760
<v Speaker 7>You ever had that accident?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I guess you have like the accidentally </v>

1966
01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:46.231
<v Speaker 7>good heckler where they're not heckling </v>
<v Speaker 7>you per say they are,</v>

1967
01:29:46.750 --> 01:29:49.030
<v Speaker 7>but they're while you're setting up your</v>
<v Speaker 7>joke,</v>

1968
01:29:49.090 --> 01:29:50.090
<v Speaker 7>they always seen,</v>

1969
01:29:50.450 --> 01:29:51.210
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1970
01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:54.970
<v Speaker 1>And it throws off your timing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

1971
01:29:55.310 --> 01:29:57.260
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck did you learn how to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

1972
01:29:57.261 --> 01:30:02.261
<v Speaker 1>Shit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever see comics that you thought </v>

1973
01:30:02.261 --> 01:30:04.271
<v Speaker 1>were really funny back in the day and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then you see them today and they're </v>

1974
01:30:04.271 --> 01:30:07.211
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>still like relying on like old stupid </v>

1975
01:30:07.211 --> 01:30:09.941
<v Speaker 1>tricks and you see their jokes coming a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mile away and you get really </v>

1976
01:30:09.941 --> 01:30:09.941
<v Speaker 1>disappointed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1977
01:30:09.941 --> 01:30:12.940
<v Speaker 1>I'm watched some dudes on TV the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>day and uh,</v>

1978
01:30:12.950 --> 01:30:16.070
<v Speaker 1>I was just sitting there watching this </v>
<v Speaker 1>guy set and I was like,</v>

1979
01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:18.680
<v Speaker 1>and then you're going to say that and he</v>
<v Speaker 1>said that.</v>

1980
01:30:19.420 --> 01:30:19.900
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1981
01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:22.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean it wasn't even like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like lobs.</v>

1982
01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:25.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's just rolling balls on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ground.</v>

1983
01:30:25.311 --> 01:30:26.840
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't even trying to get them over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the plate.</v>

1984
01:30:26.841 --> 01:30:31.841
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people like they get to a certain </v>

1985
01:30:31.841 --> 01:30:31.841
<v Speaker 1>point in time where they just fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like they stopped trying.</v>

1986
01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:32.210
<v Speaker 1>I guess</v>

1987
01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:34.980
<v Speaker 7>that's my,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's like I used to watch boxing a lot</v>

1988
01:30:35.150 --> 01:30:39.750
<v Speaker 7>and then you can realize when there's a </v>
<v Speaker 7>shock boxer had one fight too many.</v>

1989
01:30:40.230 --> 01:30:45.230
<v Speaker 7>And I remember a guy named,</v>
<v Speaker 7>his name was Gerard Washington.</v>

1990
01:30:45.420 --> 01:30:50.420
<v Speaker 7>Now the first time I seen him perform he</v>
<v Speaker 7>killed and then everybody went up to him</v>

1991
01:30:52.261 --> 01:30:53.010
<v Speaker 7>afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1992
01:30:53.011 --> 01:30:58.011
<v Speaker 7>he ripped the place apart and we'd been </v>
<v Speaker 7>doing it like two or three years and </v>

1993
01:30:58.011 --> 01:30:58.011
<v Speaker 7>say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>how many times you've done it?</v>

1994
01:30:58.011 --> 01:30:58.500
<v Speaker 7>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's the second time.</v>

1995
01:30:58.910 --> 01:30:59.880
<v Speaker 7>It was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Whoa,</v>

1996
01:30:59.940 --> 01:31:02.610
<v Speaker 7>shit,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this motherfucker in any,</v>

1997
01:31:02.630 --> 01:31:03.300
<v Speaker 7>any,</v>
<v Speaker 7>any.</v>

1998
01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:05.670
<v Speaker 7>He started doing shows around town and </v>
<v Speaker 7>Harlem is head.</v>

1999
01:31:05.671 --> 01:31:07.890
<v Speaker 7>He's just ripping.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Then he quit,</v>

2000
01:31:07.891 --> 01:31:12.891
<v Speaker 7>became an ems worker and shit and then </v>
<v Speaker 7>got married and then came back and he </v>

2001
01:31:13.540 --> 01:31:15.720
<v Speaker 7>threw the show in Queens.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He had a room in Queens.</v>

2002
01:31:15.721 --> 01:31:20.721
<v Speaker 7>I used to go to the room and then I used</v>
<v Speaker 7>to rip the room and then he used to go </v>

2003
01:31:20.721 --> 01:31:23.751
<v Speaker 7>up and he used to do bad and he was </v>
<v Speaker 7>doing the same material from before and </v>

2004
01:31:25.170 --> 01:31:27.420
<v Speaker 7>there was something missing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You don't know what it is,</v>

2005
01:31:27.800 --> 01:31:32.800
<v Speaker 7>but in all my life,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my fear is to not make that thing that </v>

2006
01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:33.060
<v Speaker 7>was missing from him.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Be Missing from me.</v>

2007
01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:36.840
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make sure you don't catch it.</v>

2008
01:31:36.890 --> 01:31:38.610
<v Speaker 1>Catch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Catch like it's tough,</v>

2009
01:31:38.611 --> 01:31:39.690
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

2010
01:31:39.691 --> 01:31:42.630
<v Speaker 1>Almost every great comedian except </v>
<v Speaker 1>prior.</v>

2011
01:31:42.900 --> 01:31:45.750
<v Speaker 1>Prior was the only one who kept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>

2012
01:31:45.751 --> 01:31:48.530
<v Speaker 1>getting better and the strongest </v>
<v Speaker 1>material is the.</v>

2013
01:31:48.531 --> 01:31:53.531
<v Speaker 1>The later material,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even like it's like some live in the </v>

2014
01:31:53.531 --> 01:31:53.531
<v Speaker 1>sunset strip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the strongest shit ever,</v>

2015
01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:59.000
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you'd go back to his early </v>

2016
01:31:59.000 --> 01:31:59.000
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was still all like really strong,</v>

2017
01:31:59.000 --> 01:32:00.130
<v Speaker 1>but like Kennison man Kennison</v>

2018
01:32:00.130 --> 01:32:05.130
<v Speaker 3>had one good cd while or it wasn't even </v>
<v Speaker 3>a CD because I don't think warner </v>

2019
01:32:05.130 --> 01:32:09.031
<v Speaker 3>brothers wanted to release it on cd </v>
<v Speaker 3>because it was so offensive to gay </v>

2020
01:32:09.031 --> 01:32:09.670
<v Speaker 3>people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was louder than hell.</v>

2021
01:32:10.150 --> 01:32:15.150
<v Speaker 3>Kennison had one hbo special that was </v>
<v Speaker 3>not quite as good as louder than hell </v>

2022
01:32:15.150 --> 01:32:19.770
<v Speaker 3>but pretty close.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then from there it was a slide from </v>

2023
01:32:19.770 --> 01:32:20.490
<v Speaker 3>the HBO special.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like he had,</v>

2024
01:32:20.560 --> 01:32:25.560
<v Speaker 3>he had a Rodney dangerfield sat and he </v>
<v Speaker 3>had an hour to hour still fucking bad </v>

2025
01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:26.410
<v Speaker 3>ass.</v>
<v Speaker 3>To this day I still watch that and laugh</v>

2026
01:32:26.411 --> 01:32:31.411
<v Speaker 3>your ass off,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's still not quite as good as </v>

2027
01:32:31.411 --> 01:32:31.411
<v Speaker 3>louder than hell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The cassette,</v>

2028
01:32:31.411 --> 01:32:33.700
<v Speaker 3>the cassette was just on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was just him,</v>

2029
01:32:33.850 --> 01:32:38.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing performances at different clubs </v>

2030
01:32:38.850 --> 01:32:38.850
<v Speaker 3>all over the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was all spliced together.</v>

2031
01:32:38.850 --> 01:32:41.350
<v Speaker 3>It was ending.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was just the best shit.</v>

2032
01:32:41.470 --> 01:32:45.520
<v Speaker 3>But then if you listen to like the stuff</v>
<v Speaker 3>from like to not even a year later,</v>

2033
01:32:45.521 --> 01:32:47.710
<v Speaker 3>two years later,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the next whatever the next cd was,</v>

2034
01:32:48.430 --> 01:32:53.430
<v Speaker 3>it's like a copycat of his old act.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like somebody,</v>

2035
01:32:54.970 --> 01:32:59.970
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somebody pretending to be him and his </v>

2036
01:32:59.970 --> 01:33:02.391
<v Speaker 3>him like a dumb guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like a dumb guys got the reins now and </v>

2037
01:33:02.391 --> 01:33:04.360
<v Speaker 3>then he's going to make stuff that's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like barely amusing</v>

2038
01:33:04.470 --> 01:33:05.090
<v Speaker 11>he's got.</v>

2039
01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:08.320
<v Speaker 3>And it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2040
01:33:08.321 --> 01:33:10.300
<v Speaker 3>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you looked at that like as a store,</v>

2041
01:33:10.301 --> 01:33:12.040
<v Speaker 3>like the structure of that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like,</v>

2042
01:33:12.041 --> 01:33:13.850
<v Speaker 3>so lacking in a joke structure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2043
01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:15.520
<v Speaker 3>You can go back to like his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2044
01:33:15.521 --> 01:33:17.050
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Ethiopia bit,</v>

2045
01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:22.200
<v Speaker 3>which is a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the one that's on louder than </v>

2046
01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:22.200
<v Speaker 3>hell.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't think it's on the um,</v>

2047
01:33:22.200 --> 01:33:26.200
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's on his hbo special,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that Ethiopia bit is fucked up</v>

2048
01:33:26.590 --> 01:33:28.980
<v Speaker 11>where he's already at a point.</v>
<v Speaker 11>Yeah,</v>

2049
01:33:28.990 --> 01:33:31.790
<v Speaker 11>he had a great point.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's like he goes,</v>

2050
01:33:31.791 --> 01:33:36.791
<v Speaker 11>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 11>we just drove here with your friend to </v>

2051
01:33:36.791 --> 01:33:39.131
<v Speaker 11>us.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It wouldn't be if you see that,</v>

2052
01:33:41.490 --> 01:33:45.290
<v Speaker 11>don't want to know.</v>
<v Speaker 11>It's going to be 100 years now.</v>

2053
01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:48.080
<v Speaker 11>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 11>We got deserts in America too,</v>

2054
01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:53.260
<v Speaker 11>we just don't,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and he was just destroying and he made,</v>

2055
01:33:54.940 --> 01:33:55.310
<v Speaker 11>he had a the</v>

2056
01:33:55.350 --> 01:34:00.350
<v Speaker 3>point and it was like he thought it out </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it was fucked up that he was saying </v>

2057
01:34:00.350 --> 01:34:01.200
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was still funny.</v>

2058
01:34:01.770 --> 01:34:06.770
<v Speaker 3>And then he went from that to just like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess too much coke and too much </v>

2059
01:34:06.770 --> 01:34:08.370
<v Speaker 3>parties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He got really fat.</v>

2060
01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:11.030
<v Speaker 3>He looked like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like rotund onstage,</v>

2061
01:34:11.250 --> 01:34:16.250
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he became like a caricature and then he </v>

2062
01:34:16.250 --> 01:34:16.250
<v Speaker 3>just was never the same guy again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was like,</v>

2063
01:34:16.250 --> 01:34:19.410
<v Speaker 3>he got by the same way and old rock band</v>
<v Speaker 3>gets by.</v>

2064
01:34:19.470 --> 01:34:22.600
<v Speaker 3>But he did it over just a few years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like if,</v>

2065
01:34:23.060 --> 01:34:24.970
<v Speaker 3>if his health was okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like we,</v>

2066
01:34:25.010 --> 01:34:29.010
<v Speaker 3>we could have seen the better years of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Kennison after he became famous.</v>

2067
01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:34.280
<v Speaker 3>I mean if he could keep it up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but his type of party in like that </v>

2068
01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:35.190
<v Speaker 3>cocaine and whiskey partying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it became about the party.</v>

2069
01:34:35.191 --> 01:34:39.030
<v Speaker 3>I remember seeing that Jay Jimmy's </v>
<v Speaker 3>comedy alley in Queens and Queens,</v>

2070
01:34:39.031 --> 01:34:42.360
<v Speaker 3>like two years after,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the funny Shit,</v>

2071
01:34:42.390 --> 01:34:43.190
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2072
01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:46.110
<v Speaker 3>when it was going away and doing smaller</v>
<v Speaker 3>venues again,</v>

2073
01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:51.600
<v Speaker 3>like I saw him twice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>three times,</v>

2074
01:34:51.630 --> 01:34:54.200
<v Speaker 3>some three times live and he got worse </v>
<v Speaker 3>every time a song,</v>

2075
01:34:54.380 --> 01:34:57.000
<v Speaker 3>whereas everything it got got Saturn,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Saturn,</v>

2076
01:34:57.110 --> 01:34:58.310
<v Speaker 3>the opening acts get shittier</v>

2077
01:34:58.310 --> 01:34:59.480
<v Speaker 1>and Shittier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was bad.</v>

2078
01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:01.280
<v Speaker 1>Like the one of the last times I saw </v>
<v Speaker 1>him,</v>

2079
01:35:01.281 --> 01:35:03.560
<v Speaker 1>it was just not a good shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You wanted to laugh,</v>

2080
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:06.200
<v Speaker 1>but there was no opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just it just wasn't good.</v>

2081
01:35:06.590 --> 01:35:11.510
<v Speaker 1>And then his last thing that he did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was like a CD.</v>

2082
01:35:11.690 --> 01:35:16.690
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of things not that bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you compare it to like louder </v>

2083
01:35:16.690 --> 01:35:16.690
<v Speaker 1>than hell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2084
01:35:16.690 --> 01:35:16.850
<v Speaker 1>The funny thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can compare it,</v>

2085
01:35:16.851 --> 01:35:21.851
<v Speaker 1>that's the only problem you can't get </v>
<v Speaker 1>louder than hell was fucking </v>

2086
01:35:21.851 --> 01:35:23.570
<v Speaker 1>outstanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he was the best comic ever for a</v>

2087
01:35:23.570 --> 01:35:25.910
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what I think for one year,</v>

2088
01:35:26.210 --> 01:35:31.210
<v Speaker 1>but overall I would say prior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prior just overall he changed the whole </v>

2089
01:35:31.581 --> 01:35:35.270
<v Speaker 1>style of comedy that people did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Opened him up,</v>

2090
01:35:35.330 --> 01:35:40.330
<v Speaker 1>opened himself up in a vulnerable way on</v>
<v Speaker 1>stage and nobody had ever come close to </v>

2091
01:35:40.330 --> 01:35:41.180
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2092
01:35:41.181 --> 01:35:44.510
<v Speaker 1>the way he would approached comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think changed comedy.</v>

2093
01:35:44.540 --> 01:35:46.380
<v Speaker 1>Kennison changed a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2094
01:35:46.420 --> 01:35:48.950
<v Speaker 1>he certainly influenced a lot of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me included,</v>

2095
01:35:49.370 --> 01:35:53.030
<v Speaker 1>but prior just in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like the number one</v>

2096
01:35:53.080 --> 01:35:58.080
<v Speaker 7>guy ever.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I called him a dirty cosby because </v>

2097
01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:02.190
<v Speaker 7>remember we used to imitate Cosby,</v>
<v Speaker 7>cosby,</v>

2098
01:36:02.470 --> 01:36:07.470
<v Speaker 7>tell people spoke to them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then it's like if you listened to </v>

2099
01:36:07.470 --> 01:36:09.870
<v Speaker 7>bill cosby to like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think himself,</v>

2100
01:36:10.110 --> 01:36:14.480
<v Speaker 7>Bill cosby himself,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like they update.</v>

2101
01:36:14.640 --> 01:36:18.120
<v Speaker 7>Those are the first two guys I </v>
<v Speaker 7>reenlisted and then this is blasphemers.</v>

2102
01:36:18.570 --> 01:36:23.570
<v Speaker 7>Prior used to talk about Red Fox and how</v>
<v Speaker 7>it influenced them and I listened to </v>

2103
01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:23.570
<v Speaker 7>read processes like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Eh,</v>

2104
01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:24.400
<v Speaker 7>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2105
01:36:24.401 --> 01:36:26.580
<v Speaker 7>this is blasphemy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I didn't say it.</v>

2106
01:36:27.380 --> 01:36:29.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try going back and watching or listening</v>

2107
01:36:29.811 --> 01:36:30.620
<v Speaker 1>to lenny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bruce,</v>

2108
01:36:31.340 --> 01:36:33.230
<v Speaker 1>you won't last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You won't laugh at all.</v>

2109
01:36:33.550 --> 01:36:35.110
<v Speaker 7>I believe you.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't even have to go back.</v>

2110
01:36:35.111 --> 01:36:36.580
<v Speaker 7>I believe it's the people</v>

2111
01:36:36.990 --> 01:36:38.940
<v Speaker 1>and I'm a huge Lenny Bruce family and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you go with my house.</v>

2112
01:36:38.941 --> 01:36:43.941
<v Speaker 1>I have an old concert posters framed on </v>
<v Speaker 1>my wall from when he was at the fillmore</v>

2113
01:36:44.431 --> 01:36:45.480
<v Speaker 1>in San Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got it.</v>

2114
01:36:45.780 --> 01:36:48.420
<v Speaker 1>I recognize that without him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's,</v>

2115
01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:53.500
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the godfather of monitor standup </v>

2116
01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:53.500
<v Speaker 1>comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the first seed,</v>

2117
01:36:53.500 --> 01:36:55.560
<v Speaker 1>the real spark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then from him,</v>

2118
01:36:55.950 --> 01:37:00.950
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's other guys in that era like the </v>

2119
01:37:00.950 --> 01:37:02.721
<v Speaker 1>more sols and a lot of those other guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>that just pointed out shit and saw </v>

2120
01:37:02.721 --> 01:37:06.801
<v Speaker 1>things in a very intelligent way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then prior comes from that seed and </v>

2121
01:37:06.960 --> 01:37:10.050
<v Speaker 1>prior takes it to the next day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The differences prior.</v>

2122
01:37:10.051 --> 01:37:15.051
<v Speaker 1>Still funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You go back and watch Richard Pryor lot </v>

2123
01:37:15.051 --> 01:37:16.140
<v Speaker 1>not live on the sunset strip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a great one too,</v>

2124
01:37:16.141 --> 01:37:18.480
<v Speaker 1>but though even the one before that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget what it's called.</v>

2125
01:37:18.750 --> 01:37:22.110
<v Speaker 1>The specialty did before that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking fantastic.</v>

2126
01:37:22.260 --> 01:37:27.260
<v Speaker 1>It's great comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's great observational comedy </v>

2127
01:37:27.260 --> 01:37:30.350
<v Speaker 1>when he's doing the thing about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Italians they were digging to get.</v>

2128
01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:34.320
<v Speaker 1>It's funny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2129
01:37:34.321 --> 01:37:37.320
<v Speaker 1>It's still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still really good to this day.</v>

2130
01:37:37.650 --> 01:37:42.420
<v Speaker 1>Whereas like the Lenny Bruce stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Red Fox to a certain extent,</v>

2131
01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:43.770
<v Speaker 1>but Red Fox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>

2132
01:37:44.190 --> 01:37:49.190
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just a different era when </v>

2133
01:37:49.190 --> 01:37:50.751
<v Speaker 1>he was just saying dirty things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody had ever heard anybody do that </v>

2134
01:37:50.751 --> 01:37:51.270
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like God damn,</v>

2135
01:37:51.271 --> 01:37:53.070
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also I think being there,</v>

2136
01:37:53.370 --> 01:37:54.570
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's different,</v>

2137
01:37:54.571 --> 01:37:56.160
<v Speaker 1>different than then that word spreads</v>

2138
01:37:56.570 --> 01:37:59.570
<v Speaker 7>and you're listening to those people </v>
<v Speaker 7>like God is going to be like,</v>

2139
01:37:59.580 --> 01:38:01.230
<v Speaker 7>there's one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>pride didn't want to have a specialist.</v>

2140
01:38:01.231 --> 01:38:03.240
<v Speaker 7>That was amazing to me.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like he was killing,</v>

2141
01:38:03.241 --> 01:38:06.240
<v Speaker 7>he was up here just killing and then </v>
<v Speaker 7>somebody said,</v>

2142
01:38:06.300 --> 01:38:08.610
<v Speaker 7>do mud bone,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and they begged him to do mud bone.</v>

2143
01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:11.730
<v Speaker 7>But then I've never seen somebody like </v>
<v Speaker 7>take it down.</v>

2144
01:38:11.731 --> 01:38:16.731
<v Speaker 7>It's like you're in a dance club and </v>
<v Speaker 7>you're playing all this hard music and </v>

2145
01:38:16.731 --> 01:38:20.310
<v Speaker 7>then we're going to play a slow takes </v>
<v Speaker 7>place,</v>

2146
01:38:20.311 --> 01:38:24.750
<v Speaker 7>gets quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it's like everybody's splits still.</v>

2147
01:38:24.780 --> 01:38:26.940
<v Speaker 7>Everybody's paying as much attention as </v>
<v Speaker 7>when he was.</v>

2148
01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:31.410
<v Speaker 7>He wasn't afraid to take it down and </v>
<v Speaker 7>like that's ballsy.</v>

2149
01:38:31.620 --> 01:38:33.600
<v Speaker 7>And they bring them back up.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Just a master.</v>

2150
01:38:33.930 --> 01:38:34.800
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean he.</v>

2151
01:38:34.820 --> 01:38:37.350
<v Speaker 7>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there was nobody like that before him.</v>

2152
01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:40.140
<v Speaker 7>He was the first guy that was really </v>
<v Speaker 7>doing it like that.</v>

2153
01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:45.880
<v Speaker 1>He was the first guy that it was really </v>
<v Speaker 1>just genuinely balls out funny all the </v>

2154
01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:50.330
<v Speaker 1>time and had like these really </v>
<v Speaker 1>heartwarming points,</v>

2155
01:38:50.830 --> 01:38:53.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he came back from Africa and he had</v>

2156
01:38:53.991 --> 01:38:58.991
<v Speaker 1>those stories about meeting Africans and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that he was gonna stop saying the word </v>

2157
01:38:58.991 --> 01:39:01.520
<v Speaker 1>nigger because of going to Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you heard that you're like,</v>

2158
01:39:01.521 --> 01:39:06.521
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what comic has ever made you feel like </v>

2159
01:39:06.521 --> 01:39:06.521
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

2160
01:39:06.521 --> 01:39:07.450
<v Speaker 7>It was funny,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like I heard that when he said that,</v>

2161
01:39:07.451 --> 01:39:08.150
<v Speaker 7>and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 7>man,</v>

2162
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:13.390
<v Speaker 7>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's a great point,</v>

2163
01:39:14.681 --> 01:39:19.681
<v Speaker 7>Richard.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You basically my comedy guy saying it's </v>

2164
01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:24.780
<v Speaker 7>just too potent a word and only allowed </v>
<v Speaker 7>to toss it around.</v>

2165
01:39:24.860 --> 01:39:28.330
<v Speaker 7>Can't stop it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Stopped is what you started.</v>

2166
01:39:28.390 --> 01:39:29.760
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's amazing that it's become a</v>

2167
01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:35.040
<v Speaker 1>and empowerment word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the word has gone from a word </v>

2168
01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:39.761
<v Speaker 1>that's a slur to still being a slur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but more often and empowerment and </v>

2169
01:39:40.221 --> 01:39:45.221
<v Speaker 1>unlike a film familiarity word that </v>
<v Speaker 1>black people are allowed to use amongst </v>

2170
01:39:45.221 --> 01:39:47.300
<v Speaker 1>themselves and when you actually do try </v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2171
01:39:47.330 --> 01:39:51.320
<v Speaker 1>like a white person does try to use it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like almost legalized violence like</v>

2172
01:39:51.321 --> 01:39:53.840
<v Speaker 1>there will almost legally allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>kick your ass.</v>

2173
01:39:53.841 --> 01:39:58.841
<v Speaker 1>So it's become a crazy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not like it's never said what you </v>

2174
01:39:58.841 --> 01:39:59.270
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll make people devastated.</v>

2175
01:39:59.271 --> 01:40:02.180
<v Speaker 1>No black people say it all the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>amongst themselves.</v>

2176
01:40:02.430 --> 01:40:04.600
<v Speaker 1>A very interesting sort of a dynamic.</v>

2177
01:40:04.650 --> 01:40:06.740
<v Speaker 7>But the daringness of it and the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

2178
01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:11.830
<v Speaker 7>the chance of saying it makes white </v>
<v Speaker 7>people I know say it like hey,</v>

2179
01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:17.400
<v Speaker 7>like I was hanging out in this coffee </v>
<v Speaker 7>shop who's eaten and one of the young </v>

2180
01:40:17.551 --> 01:40:18.480
<v Speaker 7>comics,</v>
<v Speaker 7>he was like,</v>

2181
01:40:18.690 --> 01:40:21.450
<v Speaker 7>he started doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this verse from this.</v>

2182
01:40:21.460 --> 01:40:26.460
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But he knows the word Niggas ain't </v>

2183
01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:26.460
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right,</v>

2184
01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:26.460
<v Speaker 7>right,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right,</v>

2185
01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:26.460
<v Speaker 7>right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then he says it and it's like,</v>

2186
01:40:26.460 --> 01:40:27.990
<v Speaker 7>but I'm not going to react to that </v>
<v Speaker 7>because you know why?</v>

2187
01:40:28.020 --> 01:40:31.250
<v Speaker 7>Because I'm over the word nigger.</v>
<v Speaker 7>This is nothing.</v>

2188
01:40:31.650 --> 01:40:34.470
<v Speaker 1>But there's a difference between that </v>
<v Speaker 1>and him calling somebody.</v>

2189
01:40:34.970 --> 01:40:35.500
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But,</v>

2190
01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:38.540
<v Speaker 7>but there is a way they know they can't </v>
<v Speaker 7>call,</v>

2191
01:40:39.350 --> 01:40:40.730
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they know I'm there.</v>

2192
01:40:41.020 --> 01:40:42.830
<v Speaker 7>You can't call somebody there.</v>

2193
01:40:42.850 --> 01:40:47.850
<v Speaker 1>So it's just saying it to get a rush </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves because now they're getting </v>

2194
01:40:47.850 --> 01:40:47.850
<v Speaker 1>away with it</v>

2195
01:40:47.850 --> 01:40:48.150
<v Speaker 7>to get away with it.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2196
01:40:48.270 --> 01:40:52.440
<v Speaker 7>And so I noticed that white guys do that</v>
<v Speaker 7>to try to get away with it in front of a</v>

2197
01:40:52.500 --> 01:40:57.500
<v Speaker 7>blackboard.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's no fun if you say it in front of </v>

2198
01:40:57.500 --> 01:40:57.500
<v Speaker 7>white people.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

2199
01:40:57.500 --> 01:40:57.670
<v Speaker 7>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you can say it,</v>

2200
01:40:57.910 --> 01:41:00.730
<v Speaker 7>like somebody will repeat one of my </v>
<v Speaker 7>jokes back to me.</v>

2201
01:41:00.940 --> 01:41:02.260
<v Speaker 7>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the n word.</v>

2202
01:41:02.330 --> 01:41:07.330
<v Speaker 7>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's like there's nothing you can do </v>

2203
01:41:07.330 --> 01:41:07.330
<v Speaker 7>because it's your job.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You did say it.</v>

2204
01:41:07.330 --> 01:41:08.460
<v Speaker 3>What did you think about the controversy</v>
<v Speaker 3>with this?</v>

2205
01:41:08.461 --> 01:41:09.720
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

2206
01:41:09.721 --> 01:41:10.890
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Django movie,</v>

2207
01:41:11.490 --> 01:41:12.540
<v Speaker 3>Django unchained,</v>

2208
01:41:12.930 --> 01:41:14.150
<v Speaker 7>I think it was a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2209
01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:16.050
<v Speaker 7>no controversy,</v>
<v Speaker 7>controversy.</v>

2210
01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:21.020
<v Speaker 7>Like I'm wondering if spike Lee is </v>
<v Speaker 7>really just trying to help at the boy.</v>

2211
01:41:21.050 --> 01:41:23.380
<v Speaker 7>He's boys with terantin on the low and </v>
<v Speaker 7>this,</v>

2212
01:41:23.450 --> 01:41:25.710
<v Speaker 7>this is his way to help him sell movies.</v>

2213
01:41:26.420 --> 01:41:31.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think he's a professional troll at </v>

2214
01:41:31.420 --> 01:41:32.150
<v Speaker 3>this point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean he supposed sued spike TV and one</v>

2215
01:41:32.151 --> 01:41:33.650
<v Speaker 3>a shitload of money.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2216
01:41:33.651 --> 01:41:38.651
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of spike Jones,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of spike Lee and none of </v>

2217

<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

2219
01:41:38.651 --> 01:41:41.240
<v Speaker 3>there's a lot of other spikes besides </v>
<v Speaker 3>spike Lee.</v>

2220
01:41:41.540 --> 01:41:43.520
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would think it's got to be hundreds of</v>

2221
01:41:43.521 --> 01:41:44.000
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

<v Speaker 7>The dog's spike suit.</v>

2226
01:41:55.731 --> 01:41:56.300
<v Speaker 7>Spike Lee?</v>

2227
01:41:56.460 --> 01:41:58.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2230
01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:03.660
<v Speaker 7>now.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That to me is like,</v>

2231
01:42:03.940 --> 01:42:06.950
<v Speaker 7>like the Django Shit with Spike Lee.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's him hating.</v>

2232
01:42:07.340 --> 01:42:08.670
<v Speaker 7>That's to me,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's like,</v>

2233
01:42:09.080 --> 01:42:10.940
<v Speaker 7>you should have made this movie.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You didn't.</v>

2234
01:42:11.700 --> 01:42:12.920
<v Speaker 7>And this white guy made it.</v>

2235
01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:14.140
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He uh,</v>

2236
01:42:14.170 --> 01:42:17.950
<v Speaker 3>he fell apart artistically awhile ago.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Something happened in that guy.</v>

2237
01:42:17.951 --> 01:42:19.360
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't do the same shit that he used</v>
<v Speaker 3>to do.</v>

2238
01:42:19.361 --> 01:42:20.740
<v Speaker 3>If you go back to like do the right </v>
<v Speaker 3>thing,</v>

2239
01:42:20.741 --> 01:42:22.910
<v Speaker 3>like his movies had this crackle to </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

2240
01:42:23.570 --> 01:42:24.980
<v Speaker 3>Mo Betta Blues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know</v>

2241
01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:27.730
<v Speaker 7>what happened at her?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh my,</v>

2242
01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:32.760
<v Speaker 7>this,</v>
<v Speaker 7>this pen clicking the grades over there </v>

2243
01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:33.310
<v Speaker 7>because it's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think spitely this is,</v>

2244
01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:38.340
<v Speaker 7>this is spike Lee's emo.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Make one really great movie and then </v>

2245
01:42:38.340 --> 01:42:40.340
<v Speaker 7>make one really bad movie to the point </v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

2246
01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:45.550
<v Speaker 7>is this the same person?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Then he'll make another really good </v>

2247
01:42:45.550 --> 01:42:46.570
<v Speaker 7>movie and then they'll make another like</v>
<v Speaker 7>you can name like,</v>

2248
01:42:46.600 --> 01:42:47.500
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

2249
01:42:48.070 --> 01:42:50.050
<v Speaker 7>like what was it?</v>
<v Speaker 7>She's got a,</v>

2250
01:42:50.190 --> 01:42:52.870
<v Speaker 7>there's a movie where she's got a habit </v>
<v Speaker 7>and she's got a habit.</v>

2251
01:42:52.871 --> 01:42:54.040
<v Speaker 7>Then he made some movie where</v>

2252
01:42:54.070 --> 01:42:59.070
<v Speaker 3>you got to give it up to that movie </v>
<v Speaker 3>because that movie made girls empowered </v>

2253
01:42:59.070 --> 01:43:00.370
<v Speaker 3>to go get some deck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it was okay to go get some Dick.</v>

2254
01:43:00.400 --> 01:43:01.140
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2255
01:43:01.190 --> 01:43:05.470
<v Speaker 3>like he made a whole movie about a girl </v>
<v Speaker 3>has got to get some tech and every,</v>

2256
01:43:05.650 --> 01:43:06.550
<v Speaker 3>all the other girls like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2257
01:43:06.551 --> 01:43:11.551
<v Speaker 3>I don't have to feel bad about having to</v>
<v Speaker 3>get some tech because this is like the </v>

2258
01:43:11.551 --> 01:43:13.120
<v Speaker 3>lead of the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Getting some data in that way.</v>

2259
01:43:13.180 --> 01:43:16.650
<v Speaker 3>I think he hooked a lot of dudes up and </v>
<v Speaker 3>he probably got a lot of guys laid for</v>

2260
01:43:16.650 --> 01:43:17.160
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 7>all time is Malcolm x and do the right </v>

2263

<v Speaker 7>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And then he's got movies that are in my </v>

2264
01:43:27.691 --> 01:43:27.730
<v Speaker 7>own words,</v>
<v Speaker 7>all time.</v>

2265
01:43:27.731 --> 01:43:29.440
<v Speaker 7>Worst movies.</v>

<v Speaker 7>And you don't know what the fuck is </v>

2269
01:43:40.631 --> 01:43:41.050

<v Speaker 7>It's pretty decent.</v>

2272
01:43:44.650 --> 01:43:47.350
<v Speaker 7>But it's hard to believe that again,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that that's the same dude.</v>

2273
01:43:47.620 --> 01:43:50.040
<v Speaker 7>That's the best to do the right thing </v>
<v Speaker 7>guy.</v>

2277
01:43:56.150 --> 01:43:59.170

<v Speaker 3>I thought the store was ridiculous,</v>

2310
01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:27.640
<v Speaker 3>but it was so visually stunning and </v>
<v Speaker 3>impressive that it mostly kept me </v>

2311
01:45:27.740 --> 01:45:32.740
<v Speaker 3>occupied.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially when you consider the fact </v>

2312
01:45:32.740 --> 01:45:32.740
<v Speaker 3>that wasn't even a real tiger like that.</v>

<v Speaker 3>animals.</v>

2315
01:45:38.750 --> 01:45:42.440
<v Speaker 3>If you go back just five or six years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they couldn't do that.</v>

2316
01:45:42.550 --> 01:45:44.390
<v Speaker 3>They like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we always talk about that movie.</v>

2317
01:45:44.391 --> 01:45:47.180

<v Speaker 3>There's a scene where the lion takes out</v>

2318
01:45:47.181 --> 01:45:50.960
<v Speaker 3>the deer and Manhattan Line looks fake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It looks so fake,</v>

2319
01:45:51.410 --> 01:45:54.710
<v Speaker 3>but this tiger looks way real.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it was in some things.</v>

<v Speaker 3>shots that he had.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean it was just a brilliantly film </v>

2323
01:46:06.660 --> 01:46:10.161
<v Speaker 3>moved to the point where a stupid plot </v>
<v Speaker 3>like didn't stop me from enjoying the </v>

2324
01:46:10.161 --> 01:46:11.400
<v Speaker 3>movie because it was so good because I,</v>

<v Speaker 3>And we were dying,</v>

2621
01:59:10.480 --> 01:59:15.480
<v Speaker 3>dying.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I remember thinking I had never </v>

2622
01:59:15.480 --> 01:59:16.360
<v Speaker 3>heard any of these bits before.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's fucking killing.</v>

2623
01:59:16.570 --> 01:59:18.340
<v Speaker 3>And He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in my opinion,</v>

2624
01:59:18.341 --> 01:59:22.410
<v Speaker 3>didn't get the respect that he deserved.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He wanted to be like a movement stopping</v>

2625
01:59:22.480 --> 01:59:27.480
<v Speaker 3>that bugged them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucked them like crazy because being on </v>

2626
01:59:27.480 --> 01:59:29.320
<v Speaker 3>the road apparently he would get like </v>
<v Speaker 3>real snotty with people on the road,</v>

2627
01:59:29.560 --> 01:59:33.340
<v Speaker 3>like you would work in clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think with a lot of guys,</v>

2628
01:59:33.370 --> 01:59:38.370
<v Speaker 3>it's a prestige thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They don't feel respected if they have </v>

2629
01:59:38.370 --> 01:59:41.821
<v Speaker 3>to do the road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like he said something once I remember </v>

2630
01:59:41.821 --> 01:59:41.821
<v Speaker 3>this goes up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I knew how much,</v>

2631
01:59:41.821 --> 01:59:41.821
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2632
01:59:41.821 --> 01:59:42.940
<v Speaker 3>I was going to do the road.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wouldn't be living in La.</v>

2633
01:59:42.941 --> 01:59:44.620
<v Speaker 3>I moved to La because I thought I was </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to do TV.</v>

2634
01:59:44.650 --> 01:59:46.780
<v Speaker 3>Like you were saying that it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you know that you're Richard?</v>

2635
01:59:46.780 --> 01:59:49.480
<v Speaker 3>Jenny,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you understand that most comics,</v>

2636
01:59:49.481 --> 01:59:51.270
<v Speaker 3>like they'll step back and go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2637
01:59:51.280 --> 01:59:54.220
<v Speaker 3>there's a master that's master guy just </v>
<v Speaker 3>walked in.</v>

2638
01:59:54.340 --> 01:59:59.340
<v Speaker 3>The guy that's about to go on stage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>watch what he does because that is a </v>

2639
01:59:59.340 --> 02:00:00.760
<v Speaker 3>master at crafting and delivering comedy</v>
<v Speaker 3>material.</v>

2640
02:00:00.900 --> 02:00:02.440
<v Speaker 3>He was over being Richard Jeni.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

2641
02:00:02.441 --> 02:00:07.441
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like looking at Seinfeld and all </v>

2642
02:00:07.441 --> 02:00:07.630
<v Speaker 3>his peers and their success and it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

2643
02:00:07.840 --> 02:00:09.770
<v Speaker 3>it's tough to look and see how it's </v>
<v Speaker 3>problem.</v>

2644
02:00:10.240 --> 02:00:15.240
<v Speaker 3>You really are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's it will eat away at you because </v>

2645
02:00:15.240 --> 02:00:16.000
<v Speaker 3>like you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a different hour every night at the</v>

2646
02:00:16.001 --> 02:00:19.750
<v Speaker 3>east side comedy club and he did a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of specials.</v>

2647
02:00:19.900 --> 02:00:24.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And it just didn't get to where he felt </v>

2648
02:00:24.900 --> 02:00:24.900
<v Speaker 3>he could have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2649
02:00:24.900 --> 02:00:25.510
<v Speaker 3>I guess so man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2650
02:00:25.511 --> 02:00:28.090
<v Speaker 3>I think that his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in his mind,</v>

2651
02:00:28.091 --> 02:00:29.980
<v Speaker 3>if you want to do in movies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>have,</v>

2652
02:00:29.981 --> 02:00:32.620
<v Speaker 3>you weren't doing a big hit series.</v>

2653
02:00:32.620 --> 02:00:34.600
<v Speaker 3>You were a failure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2654
02:00:34.630 --> 02:00:36.010
<v Speaker 3>for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason.</v>

2655
02:00:36.040 --> 02:00:41.040
<v Speaker 3>That's how he looked at it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And when he was 49 it was when he </v>

2656
02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:44.370
<v Speaker 3>committed suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess he just got to that point where </v>

2657
02:00:44.370 --> 02:00:44.890
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2658
02:00:44.891 --> 02:00:47.200
<v Speaker 3>he just couldn't imagine it getting any </v>
<v Speaker 3>better.</v>

2659
02:00:47.230 --> 02:00:52.230
<v Speaker 3>He's not going to become a movie star at</v>
<v Speaker 3>50 and just couldn't fucking take it </v>

2660
02:00:52.230 --> 02:00:54.670
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But as a comic man mean he was a fuck is</v>

2661
02:00:54.680 --> 02:00:59.680
<v Speaker 3>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's just one of the best I've ever </v>

2662
02:00:59.680 --> 02:00:59.680
<v Speaker 3>seen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Who's a great comment.</v>

2663
02:00:59.680 --> 02:00:59.680
<v Speaker 3>The good thing is I met him before he </v>
<v Speaker 3>died.</v>

2664
02:00:59.890 --> 02:01:04.890
<v Speaker 3>He,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was coming to the laugh factory and </v>

2665
02:01:04.890 --> 02:01:07.561

<v Speaker 3>No long conversations really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I didn't tell him how.</v>

2667
02:01:12.730 --> 02:01:14.950
<v Speaker 3>I ain't going to have to tell them how </v>
<v Speaker 3>funny the fuck he was.</v>

<v Speaker 7>but he ended up like laying on the </v>

2726
02:03:51.950 --> 02:03:54.631
<v Speaker 7>stage,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like having a casual conversation with </v>

<v Speaker 7>from him.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2733
02:04:07.020 --> 02:04:08.550
<v Speaker 1>I learned that from him because he </v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

2734
02:04:08.850 --> 02:04:11.850
<v Speaker 1>he would go like my jokes at the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>were like,</v>

2735
02:04:11.851 --> 02:04:13.170
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You like rudimentary.</v>

2736
02:04:13.200 --> 02:04:13.910
<v Speaker 1>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2737
02:04:14.030 --> 02:04:16.260
<v Speaker 1>a little clunky wheels that I'd made out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of like,</v>

2738
02:04:16.430 --> 02:04:18.120
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of a piece of wood.</v>

2739
02:04:18.390 --> 02:04:22.140
<v Speaker 1>They were one very sophisticated and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I would watch him and I would watch</v>

2740
02:04:22.141 --> 02:04:27.141
<v Speaker 1>how he would take a subject and explore </v>
<v Speaker 1>every possible angle.</v>

2741
02:04:28.231 --> 02:04:30.870
<v Speaker 1>And when he did that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it made it so much funnier.</v>

2742
02:04:30.900 --> 02:04:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then I realized like,</v>

2743
02:04:32.130 --> 02:04:33.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not doing that.</v>

2744
02:04:33.141 --> 02:04:35.340
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm not exploring things far </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

2745
02:04:35.400 --> 02:04:37.860
<v Speaker 1>And now to this day when I watch a on </v>
<v Speaker 1>stage</v>

2746
02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:40.490
<v Speaker 3>and he keeps going with a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I enjoy it more.</v>

2747
02:04:40.610 --> 02:04:45.150
<v Speaker 3>Like when you were doing a bit the other</v>
<v Speaker 3>day that I was dying laughing on man.</v>

2748
02:04:45.360 --> 02:04:50.360
<v Speaker 3>The difference between how many white </v>
<v Speaker 3>bankers rob people and how many black </v>

2749
02:04:51.331 --> 02:04:53.240
<v Speaker 3>dudes with hoodies and the black dude </v>
<v Speaker 3>with hoodies,</v>

2750
02:04:53.290 --> 02:04:55.680
<v Speaker 3>Robert things because he's got to pay </v>
<v Speaker 3>the white bag or like damn,</v>

2751
02:04:55.740 --> 02:05:00.210
<v Speaker 3>I got to play these bags and you take </v>
<v Speaker 3>it,</v>

2752
02:05:00.520 --> 02:05:02.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you take it really far,</v>

2753
02:05:02.011 --> 02:05:07.011
<v Speaker 3>you keep going and going and going and </v>
<v Speaker 3>going with it and as it goes on and on </v>

2754
02:05:07.011 --> 02:05:08.700
<v Speaker 3>and on it becomes funnier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And as a,</v>

2755
02:05:08.760 --> 02:05:10.980
<v Speaker 3>as a comic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like I know that already,</v>

2756
02:05:11.070 --> 02:05:13.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like sort of as a way of operating,</v>

2757
02:05:14.220 --> 02:05:16.050
<v Speaker 3>but to see it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like to see it</v>

2758
02:05:16.070 --> 02:05:18.500
<v Speaker 7>sometimes we forget what we know.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>

2759
02:05:18.530 --> 02:05:23.530
<v Speaker 7>And then like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like somebody told me that about me and </v>

2760
02:05:23.530 --> 02:05:23.600
<v Speaker 7>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh shit,</v>

2761
02:05:23.601 --> 02:05:28.060
<v Speaker 7>I do do that because sometimes you </v>
<v Speaker 7>forget what,</v>

2762
02:05:28.340 --> 02:05:32.510
<v Speaker 7>what makes you operate.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Like I remember being a comic,</v>

2763
02:05:32.610 --> 02:05:37.610
<v Speaker 7>like an early comic and then pipe man,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I need more topics so I can have more </v>

2764
02:05:37.611 --> 02:05:42.050
<v Speaker 7>jokes and then it hit me later on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't need more topics.</v>

2765
02:05:42.350 --> 02:05:46.430
<v Speaker 7>I just need to explore the topics that I</v>
<v Speaker 7>have more.</v>

2766
02:05:46.540 --> 02:05:49.820
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's not about how many topics I have,</v>

2767
02:05:50.200 --> 02:05:53.990
<v Speaker 7>it's how many like how much I can milk </v>
<v Speaker 7>something.</v>

2768
02:05:54.080 --> 02:05:55.280
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And it,</v>

2769
02:05:55.290 --> 02:05:57.920
<v Speaker 7>it becomes better,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it comes better and then,</v>

2770
02:05:57.921 --> 02:06:02.921
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>once you have the crowd rolling out a </v>

2771
02:06:02.921 --> 02:06:03.080
<v Speaker 7>joke and you keep hitting them,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you don't have to set anything up.</v>

2772
02:06:03.081 --> 02:06:08.081
<v Speaker 7>Everything is a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's like it's almost like a boxing </v>

2773
02:06:08.081 --> 02:06:08.081
<v Speaker 7>match.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Your work in the volume work in the body</v>

2774
02:06:08.081 --> 02:06:09.440
<v Speaker 7>and they're bending over and now I can </v>
<v Speaker 7>hit them in the head.</v>

2775
02:06:10.180 --> 02:06:10.940
<v Speaker 7>You can knock them out</v>

2776
02:06:11.210 --> 02:06:15.480
<v Speaker 3>and then sometimes you milk it too much </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you've got to back off that shit.</v>

2777
02:06:15.590 --> 02:06:16.680
<v Speaker 3>Like sometimes you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>alright,</v>

2778
02:06:16.750 --> 02:06:17.170
<v Speaker 3>gotta change.</v>

2779
02:06:18.000 --> 02:06:18.680
<v Speaker 7>You learn.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

2780
02:06:19.410 --> 02:06:21.720
<v Speaker 7>sometimes somebody has the whisper </v>
<v Speaker 7>something into a tape recorder.</v>

2781
02:06:25.170 --> 02:06:27.250
<v Speaker 3>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But sometimes you,</v>

2782
02:06:27.251 --> 02:06:27.940
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2783
02:06:27.941 --> 02:06:31.490
<v Speaker 3>that's the only way to come up with new </v>
<v Speaker 3>angles to explore.</v>

2784
02:06:31.700 --> 02:06:36.700
<v Speaker 3>Like that's one of the cool things about</v>
<v Speaker 3>doing a small club is that you can fuck </v>

2785
02:06:36.700 --> 02:06:40.591
<v Speaker 3>around Brown and a small club way better</v>
<v Speaker 3>than you can in a giant theater when </v>

2786
02:06:40.591 --> 02:06:41.740
<v Speaker 3>you're in a giant theater.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like for the most part you kind of doing</v>

2787
02:06:41.741 --> 02:06:43.810
<v Speaker 3>a show like I'll fuck around a little </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit,</v>

2788
02:06:44.260 --> 02:06:46.480
<v Speaker 3>but for the most part you're doing a </v>
<v Speaker 3>show you give,</v>

2789
02:06:46.520 --> 02:06:48.370
<v Speaker 3>you give the people what they paid for.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2790
02:06:48.371 --> 02:06:50.530
<v Speaker 3>But I still let leave room to fuck </v>
<v Speaker 3>around.</v>

2791
02:06:50.531 --> 02:06:51.000
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to.</v>

2792
02:06:51.310 --> 02:06:52.410
<v Speaker 3>And when I did my,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2793
02:06:52.420 --> 02:06:57.420
<v Speaker 3>the end of the world show at the wiltern</v>
<v Speaker 3>and down was like a big show for me </v>

2794
02:06:57.420 --> 02:06:58.750
<v Speaker 3>because it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a honey honey the band,</v>

2795
02:06:58.810 --> 02:07:00.370
<v Speaker 3>which I think are great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

2796
02:07:00.371 --> 02:07:02.590
<v Speaker 3>they're good friends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd be on the podcast many times.</v>

2797
02:07:02.590 --> 02:07:07.590
<v Speaker 3>They did like 20 minutes and then Joey </v>
<v Speaker 3>Diaz does like close to a half an hour I</v>

2798
02:07:08.171 --> 02:07:13.171
<v Speaker 3>guess.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then Stan hope does close to an </v>

2799
02:07:13.171 --> 02:07:13.171
<v Speaker 3>hour.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did 15 minutes,</v>

2800
02:07:13.171 --> 02:07:14.860
<v Speaker 3>so the whole show's like an hour and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

2801
02:07:14.890 --> 02:07:19.890
<v Speaker 3>30,</v>
<v Speaker 3>40 minutes long before I even get up on </v>

2802
02:07:19.890 --> 02:07:19.890
<v Speaker 3>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2803
02:07:19.890 --> 02:07:23.070
<v Speaker 3>But they were so good that right away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like the crowd was so good that right </v>

2804
02:07:23.070 --> 02:07:25.180
<v Speaker 3>away I was fucking around and I came up </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a whole new bit,</v>

2805
02:07:25.210 --> 02:07:29.050
<v Speaker 3>like onstage in the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just riffed a whole new bit.</v>

2806
02:07:29.290 --> 02:07:34.290
<v Speaker 3>And then I remember like I got to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>home and listen to that one because </v>

2807
02:07:34.290 --> 02:07:34.600
<v Speaker 3>there was a lot like that was a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 3>shit.</v>

2808
02:07:34.601 --> 02:07:36.490
<v Speaker 3>I just thought of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2809
02:07:36.491 --> 02:07:41.491
<v Speaker 3>because when you're doing a bit and it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>killing sometimes you'll just think on </v>

2810
02:07:41.491 --> 02:07:41.491
<v Speaker 3>the spot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2811
02:07:41.491 --> 02:07:42.630
<v Speaker 3>And then you could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why wouldn't you just do that?</v>

2812
02:07:42.630 --> 02:07:44.260
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then just go with it.</v>

2813
02:07:44.770 --> 02:07:46.740
<v Speaker 3>But sometimes it doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes you,</v>

2814
02:07:46.760 --> 02:07:49.030
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you come up with a new thing for a bit.</v>

2815
02:07:49.031 --> 02:07:54.031
<v Speaker 3>You've been doing for a minute.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know what took me so long to think </v>

2816
02:07:54.031 --> 02:07:54.031
<v Speaker 3>of this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

2817
02:07:54.031 --> 02:07:54.550
<v Speaker 3>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how stupid am I?</v>

2818
02:07:54.570 --> 02:07:56.470
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see that in front of my </v>
<v Speaker 3>friends.</v>

2819
02:07:58.090 --> 02:08:03.090
<v Speaker 3>And then the worst is when you record a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit and then after it's done on a CD or </v>

2820
02:08:03.090 --> 02:08:04.780
<v Speaker 3>a special,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have a new tagline for it,</v>

2821
02:08:04.781 --> 02:08:06.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's too late.</v>

2822
02:08:08.440 --> 02:08:13.440
<v Speaker 3>That's Hedberg actually did a joke on </v>
<v Speaker 3>two separate cds and he goes,</v>

2823
02:08:14.150 --> 02:08:14.200
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

2824
02:08:14.290 --> 02:08:19.290
<v Speaker 6>this joke is on my first album,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I added something to tell you like </v>

2825
02:08:21.100 --> 02:08:24.370
<v Speaker 6>what party added.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm paraphrasing,</v>

2826
02:08:24.371 --> 02:08:25.200
<v Speaker 6>I don't remember how you signed up,</v>

2827
02:08:25.220 --> 02:08:30.220
<v Speaker 3>but he's one of my favorites ever to </v>
<v Speaker 3>listen to like in the car cause and </v>

2828
02:08:30.490 --> 02:08:33.110
<v Speaker 3>squeaky clean.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hedberg squeaky clean.</v>

2829
02:08:33.111 --> 02:08:34.370
<v Speaker 3>You could play it in front of your </v>
<v Speaker 3>mother.</v>

2830
02:08:34.670 --> 02:08:38.330
<v Speaker 3>Like he might say what the fuck man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He might say that every now and again,</v>

2831
02:08:38.331 --> 02:08:42.110
<v Speaker 3>like very rarely,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but like the content of his material was</v>

2832
02:08:42.111 --> 02:08:44.720
<v Speaker 3>just observational humor that was just </v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous.</v>

2833
02:08:44.721 --> 02:08:46.970
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he would make you stoned.</v>

2834
02:08:47.150 --> 02:08:49.910
<v Speaker 3>You would feel stone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Listen to Mitch Hedberg,</v>

2835
02:08:49.940 --> 02:08:51.840
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>jazz comedy and Shit.</v>

2836
02:08:51.910 --> 02:08:56.910
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Somebody asked me if I wanted a frozen </v>

2837
02:08:56.910 --> 02:08:56.910
<v Speaker 3>banana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I said no,</v>

2838
02:08:56.910 --> 02:08:59.360
<v Speaker 3>but I want a regular banana later.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So yeah.</v>

2839
02:08:59.400 --> 02:09:04.400
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So stupid.</v>

2840
02:09:06.450 --> 02:09:09.270
<v Speaker 6>If you saw that written down on paper,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's like,</v>

2841
02:09:09.480 --> 02:09:10.170
<v Speaker 6>that seems like,</v>

2842
02:09:10.290 --> 02:09:12.600
<v Speaker 3>like a line that would be in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>children's book,</v>

2843
02:09:12.870 --> 02:09:14.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sounds Dr.</v>

2844
02:09:14.230 --> 02:09:19.020
<v Speaker 3>Seuss's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but coming out of him it was hilarious.</v>

2845
02:09:19.590 --> 02:09:24.590
<v Speaker 3>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he was just such a fun guy to listen to </v>

2846
02:09:24.590 --> 02:09:26.190
<v Speaker 3>this and then that's a perfect example </v>
<v Speaker 3>of like comedy,</v>

2847
02:09:26.191 --> 02:09:31.191
<v Speaker 3>like being like something dudes have a </v>
<v Speaker 3>style and it don't make any sense that </v>

2848
02:09:31.191 --> 02:09:32.790
<v Speaker 3>you couldn't do it and I couldn't do it </v>
<v Speaker 3>that way,</v>

2849
02:09:32.791 --> 02:09:34.260
<v Speaker 3>but for him,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bam.</v>

2850
02:09:34.261 --> 02:09:35.100
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit.</v>

2851
02:09:35.130 --> 02:09:37.680
<v Speaker 3>He knows he knocks out of the park with </v>
<v Speaker 3>that style.</v>

2852
02:09:38.250 --> 02:09:43.250
<v Speaker 3>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's comedy is the only art form I </v>

2853
02:09:43.250 --> 02:09:45.300
<v Speaker 3>think where you really making your own </v>
<v Speaker 3>instrument,</v>

2854
02:09:45.690 --> 02:09:46.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

2855
02:09:46.740 --> 02:09:49.110
<v Speaker 3>you're like everybody who plays the </v>
<v Speaker 3>guitar,</v>

2856
02:09:49.220 --> 02:09:51.840
<v Speaker 3>you're playing a guitar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess if you're singing,</v>

2857
02:09:52.050 --> 02:09:54.810
<v Speaker 3>you make your own different kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>noises with your mouth.</v>

2858
02:09:55.320 --> 02:10:00.320
<v Speaker 3>But the styles of comedy very so fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>wildly like when you're trying to piece </v>

2859
02:10:00.481 --> 02:10:00.980
<v Speaker 3>it together.</v>

2860
02:10:01.030 --> 02:10:06.030
<v Speaker 3>So much uncertainty in the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it makes me mad when people aren't </v>

2861
02:10:06.241 --> 02:10:09.010
<v Speaker 3>trying to make their own instruments and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're listening to me like what?</v>

2862
02:10:09.510 --> 02:10:11.850
<v Speaker 3>You're wasting this opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2863
02:10:11.851 --> 02:10:16.851
<v Speaker 3>Well there's a lot of uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imitation in the beginning and then you </v>

2864
02:10:16.851 --> 02:10:20.460
<v Speaker 3>really,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found myself imitating Richard Jenny </v>

2865
02:10:20.460 --> 02:10:21.840
<v Speaker 3>once I was on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was probably like a year in two,</v>

2866
02:10:21.841 --> 02:10:26.841
<v Speaker 3>maybe two.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was still living in Boston and I was </v>

2867
02:10:26.841 --> 02:10:26.940
<v Speaker 3>like doing a bit and I was doing a bit </v>
<v Speaker 3>the way I thought,</v>

2868
02:10:26.941 --> 02:10:29.420
<v Speaker 3>like Richard Tray would do a bit like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>as I was saying it,</v>

2869
02:10:29.421 --> 02:10:30.980
<v Speaker 3>I was realizing I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

2870
02:10:30.981 --> 02:10:35.981
<v Speaker 3>it's so gross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I knew I was influenced by him </v>

2871
02:10:35.981 --> 02:10:35.981
<v Speaker 3>because I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would see him and I go,</v>

2872
02:10:35.981 --> 02:10:40.810
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like figuring out how to be funny </v>

2873
02:10:40.810 --> 02:10:42.701
<v Speaker 3>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But to actually like here you imitate </v>

2874
02:10:42.701 --> 02:10:45.060
<v Speaker 3>them coming out of your mouth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some people get like super sensitive</v>

2875
02:10:45.100 --> 02:10:49.810
<v Speaker 5>about that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was talking to somebody last night and</v>

2876
02:10:49.811 --> 02:10:54.811
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think like there's one female con is </v>

2877
02:10:54.811 --> 02:10:58.841
<v Speaker 5>this female comics.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She sounds like Sarah Silverman and I </v>

2878
02:10:59.351 --> 02:11:03.040
<v Speaker 5>think Sarah Silverman stitches.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She was like,</v>

2879
02:11:03.041 --> 02:11:08.041
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't see with ms dot always kinda </v>

2880
02:11:08.041 --> 02:11:09.610
<v Speaker 5>cold with me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And in my mind I'm like best because you</v>

2881
02:11:09.611 --> 02:11:11.050
<v Speaker 5>sound like Sarah Silverman.</v>

2882
02:11:13.340 --> 02:11:17.930
<v Speaker 3>This is a chick that sounds exactly like</v>
<v Speaker 3>a felicia Michael's.</v>

2883
02:11:18.380 --> 02:11:21.510
<v Speaker 3>I mean I don't know who she is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he wasn't Felicia Michael's.</v>

2884
02:11:21.540 --> 02:11:22.710
<v Speaker 3>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>

2885
02:11:22.860 --> 02:11:25.170
<v Speaker 3>that's not felicia Michael's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's crazy.</v>

2886
02:11:25.380 --> 02:11:28.470
<v Speaker 3>Like the sound of the voice,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the delivery,</v>

2887
02:11:28.471 --> 02:11:30.930
<v Speaker 3>the pacing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like she was a big Felicia.</v>

2888
02:11:30.970 --> 02:11:35.970
<v Speaker 3>Michael's checked or Swagger Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jack the Art Kalitta and shit.</v>

2889
02:11:38.220 --> 02:11:38.920

2893
02:11:47.860 --> 02:11:49.580
<v Speaker 5>Nah,</v>

2894
02:11:50.030 --> 02:11:50.690
<v Speaker 5>That was.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

2895
02:11:50.691 --> 02:11:52.160
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he added his own thing.</v>

2896
02:11:52.420 --> 02:11:53.770
<v Speaker 5>So twists,</v>
<v Speaker 5>take,</v>

2897
02:11:54.110 --> 02:11:55.700
<v Speaker 5>take all the game.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 5>And it didn't.</v>

2900
02:12:02.000 --> 02:12:05.030
<v Speaker 5>It didn't even put a scratch in his </v>
<v Speaker 5>career.</v>

2901
02:12:05.480 --> 02:12:08.360
<v Speaker 5>He came back stronger than ever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Black people lie to me.</v>

2902
02:12:08.390 --> 02:12:10.550
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was going on.</v>

2903
02:12:10.760 --> 02:12:11.450
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2904
02:12:11.451 --> 02:12:16.451
<v Speaker 5>the funny thing is I went to a viewing </v>
<v Speaker 5>party where a friend called a bunch of </v>

2905
02:12:17.901 --> 02:12:22.901
<v Speaker 5>black friends over and we watched the </v>
<v Speaker 5>video with his wife and we had food and </v>

2906
02:12:23.391 --> 02:12:24.280
<v Speaker 5>we watched the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2907
02:12:24.370 --> 02:12:25.150
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the art.</v>

2908
02:12:25.300 --> 02:12:26.820
<v Speaker 5>Kelly secretary.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Kelly sex tape.</v>

2909
02:12:27.170 --> 02:12:29.420
<v Speaker 5>What kind of funny it was just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was just,</v>

2910
02:12:29.580 --> 02:12:31.410
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're all comic mind.</v>

2911
02:12:31.410 --> 02:12:36.410
<v Speaker 5>So it was fun,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then everybody that I met that was </v>

2912
02:12:36.410 --> 02:12:36.410
<v Speaker 5>black,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they was like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you can't do that.</v>

2915
02:12:39.950 --> 02:12:43.100
<v Speaker 5>Then.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then the album after that,</v>

2916
02:12:43.130 --> 02:12:46.010
<v Speaker 5>the chocolate factory,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because number one,</v>

2921
02:12:54.740 --> 02:12:59.740
<v Speaker 5>What is it about him that he's got such </v>
<v Speaker 5>teflon skin when it comes to </v>

2922
02:12:59.740 --> 02:13:01.820
<v Speaker 5>controversy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that shit is unexplainable to me,</v>

2923
02:13:01.940 --> 02:13:04.370
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not mad at it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He seems so confident.</v>

2924
02:13:05.330 --> 02:13:07.620
<v Speaker 3>No matter what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He seems like,</v>

2925
02:13:07.770 --> 02:13:10.940
<v Speaker 3>like no problems but just going to get </v>
<v Speaker 3>through this.</v>

2931
02:13:23.921 --> 02:13:23.921
<v Speaker 3>beginning,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You're like,</v>

2934
02:13:25.791 --> 02:13:30.791
<v Speaker 3>this is not a smart guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this guy has figured out a way to </v>

2935

<v Speaker 3>carve a career through the some of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>craziest</v>

2936
02:13:32.010 --> 02:13:34.290
<v Speaker 5>controversy ever,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but as that humbled him.</v>

2937
02:13:34.380 --> 02:13:39.380
<v Speaker 5>No Bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I wish you would burn my mother fucking </v>

2938
02:13:39.380 --> 02:13:39.380
<v Speaker 5>clothes.</v>

<v Speaker 5>he's not backing off of this at all.</v>

2941
02:13:44.440 --> 02:13:49.440
<v Speaker 5>Like I like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just don't have an issue with Lindsay </v>

2944
02:13:51.620 --> 02:13:52.860
<v Speaker 5>Then I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

2945
02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:56.070
<v Speaker 5>if I was her and I could get away with </v>
<v Speaker 5>all that shit,</v>

2946
02:13:56.370 --> 02:14:00.360
<v Speaker 5>why would I stop?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's for her though.</v>

<v Speaker 1>with the sultan of Brunei.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was ratting out all the other girls </v>

3007
02:16:52.770 --> 02:16:55.000
<v Speaker 1>that one,</v>

3008
02:16:55.060 --> 02:16:58.690
<v Speaker 1>all the girls to him and he would pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>them extravagant amounts of money,</v>

3009

<v Speaker 1>Is it the girls?</v>

3074
02:20:07.280 --> 02:20:12.280
<v Speaker 1>You can't trust those girls either </v>
<v Speaker 1>because if the girls want to fuck a guy </v>

3075
02:20:12.280 --> 02:20:12.280
<v Speaker 1>from money,</v>

3076
02:20:12.600 --> 02:20:17.300
<v Speaker 7>But if a chicken describe inside the </v>
<v Speaker 7>castle or wherever that in there</v>

3108
02:21:53.400 --> 02:21:53.400
<v Speaker 1>anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

3109
02:21:53.400 --> 02:21:55.600
<v Speaker 1>this devout Christian girl from Malibu </v>
<v Speaker 1>is suing for mental anguish,</v>

3110
02:21:55.690 --> 02:21:57.670

<v Speaker 1>the salt in or his brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

3113
02:22:02.700 --> 02:22:04.270
<v Speaker 1>She never even met the salt and she </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't even get that far.</v>

3114
02:22:04.271 --> 02:22:05.680
<v Speaker 1>You gotta go through all those other </v>
<v Speaker 1>boys.</v>

3115
02:22:06.200 --> 02:22:09.070
<v Speaker 1>You got to be proven that you're down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You DTF.</v>

3116
02:22:09.280 --> 02:22:13.540
<v Speaker 1>She was allegedly forced onto to be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>private dancer in his palace grounds and</v>

3117
02:22:13.541 --> 02:22:14.770
<v Speaker 1>did not like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One bit.</v>

3118
02:22:14.771 --> 02:22:19.771
<v Speaker 1>Her lawsuit is laden with phrases such </v>
<v Speaker 1>as white slavery and Human Chattel.</v>

3119
02:22:20.350 --> 02:22:21.490
<v Speaker 1>Chattel means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3120
02:22:21.550 --> 02:22:26.100
<v Speaker 1>What is c h a t t e l l or c h a</v>

3121
02:22:26.100 --> 02:22:27.390
<v Speaker 3>t t e l.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does that mean?</v>

3122
02:22:27.391 --> 02:22:30.540
<v Speaker 3>This is from 1997 by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is before the Internet.</v>

3123
02:22:32.580 --> 02:22:33.960
<v Speaker 3>So I guess,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

3124
02:22:34.020 --> 02:22:34.620
<v Speaker 3>she put,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3125
02:22:34.621 --> 02:22:36.960
<v Speaker 3>a lawsuit out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he's a,</v>

3126
02:22:37.560 --> 02:22:39.900
<v Speaker 3>he's exempt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't have to,</v>

3127
02:22:39.901 --> 02:22:44.901
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't have to appear and deal with </v>

3128
02:22:44.901 --> 02:22:47.691
<v Speaker 3>all the bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It sounds to me like she thought that </v>

3129
02:22:47.691 --> 02:22:48.630
<v Speaker 3>she was going to be smarter than that </v>
<v Speaker 3>and she wasn't gonna have to fuck them.</v>

3130
02:22:48.890 --> 02:22:51.930
<v Speaker 3>It was probably pretty obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You getting paid 3000 bucks a night.</v>

3131
02:22:52.040 --> 02:22:55.830
<v Speaker 5>It's either that or she's insulted.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She didn't get to fuck the prince.</v>

3132
02:22:56.730 --> 02:22:57.540
<v Speaker 5>Prince.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3133
02:22:57.580 --> 02:22:59.380
<v Speaker 5>To deal with these underlings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't even meet them.</v>

3134
02:22:59.760 --> 02:23:02.700
<v Speaker 5>That's probably exactly what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She probably thought she would play him.</v>

3135
02:23:02.970 --> 02:23:07.970
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of chicks that have a </v>

3136
02:23:07.970 --> 02:23:07.970
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous amount of confidence.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3141
02:23:15.800 --> 02:23:18.930

<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3147
02:23:31.591 --> 02:23:36.591
<v Speaker 5>I'd probably.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's probably something small and not </v>

3148
02:23:36.591 --> 02:23:36.591
<v Speaker 5>too crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but not too little.</v>

<v Speaker 3>You would like seven.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Like I one black,</v>

<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

3156
02:23:55.070 --> 02:23:56.480
<v Speaker 5>But here's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You've got to think about.</v>

3157
02:23:56.780 --> 02:24:01.780
<v Speaker 5>Seven is good for you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but anybody that has anything that they </v>

3158
02:24:01.780 --> 02:24:02.270
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they want to show it off.</v>

3159

3167
02:24:25.090 --> 02:24:27.440
<v Speaker 3>but I think a lot of them was acting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3168
02:24:27.460 --> 02:24:29.160
<v Speaker 3>it was like he was like putting on this </v>
<v Speaker 3>act.</v>

3169
02:24:29.170 --> 02:24:34.170
<v Speaker 3>I always thought the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's why I made that whole bit about </v>

3170
02:24:34.170 --> 02:24:36.661

<v Speaker 3>gross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>It was like so contrived,</v>

3174
02:24:38.921 --> 02:24:43.921
<v Speaker 3>all of it and the girls would all tell </v>
<v Speaker 3>stories about how the fuck other guys </v>

<v Speaker 3>store and she would just tell horrible </v>
<v Speaker 3>things about what it was like.</v>

3178

<v Speaker 3>Like he would watch gay porn.</v>

02:25:09.790 --> 02:25:14.790
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they tried fucking dudes for a little </v>

3187
02:25:14.790 --> 02:25:14.790
<v Speaker 3>while.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They were like,</v>

3188
02:25:14.790 --> 02:25:14.790
<v Speaker 3>try gay.</v>

3189
02:25:14.790 --> 02:25:17.300
<v Speaker 5>Just fucking dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That happened.</v>

3190
02:25:17.700 --> 02:25:20.010
<v Speaker 5>That happened.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A lot of guys gave that a shot.</v>

3191
02:25:20.011 --> 02:25:24.340
<v Speaker 5>It was like sort of like this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this idea of rebelling completely</v>

3192
02:25:24.340 --> 02:25:29.340
<v Speaker 8>from the roles,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the gender roles that were established </v>

3193
02:25:29.340 --> 02:25:29.590
<v Speaker 8>by our parents who obviously were wrong </v>
<v Speaker 8>about everything else.</v>

3194
02:25:29.620 --> 02:25:34.620
<v Speaker 8>Was it the rat pack that started it?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Are seen as more like dudes who took </v>

3195
02:25:34.620 --> 02:25:34.620
<v Speaker 8>acid?</v>
<v Speaker 8>See,</v>

3196
02:25:34.620 --> 02:25:35.440
<v Speaker 8>I think we were on acid.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You wouldn't want to do it,</v>

3197
02:25:35.441 --> 02:25:39.280
<v Speaker 8>but like if you're hanging out with </v>
<v Speaker 8>Sammy and all the guys and getting drunk</v>

3198

<v Speaker 8>playing around with sticks.</v>

3199

<v Speaker 8>Crazy.</v>

3204
02:26:01.860 --> 02:26:02.320
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like,</v>

3205
02:26:02.321 --> 02:26:07.321
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like David Bowie was it make Jagger's </v>

3206
02:26:07.321 --> 02:26:08.470
<v Speaker 8>wife or David Bowie's wife.</v>
<v Speaker 8>One of them claimed that they had caught</v>

3207
02:26:08.480 --> 02:26:11.240
<v Speaker 8>David Bowie and Mick Jagger in bed </v>
<v Speaker 8>together getting their frequency,</v>

3208
02:26:11.880 --> 02:26:16.880

<v Speaker 8>I think a lot of dudes back then did </v>

3209
02:26:16.880 --> 02:26:19.691
<v Speaker 8>that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They all look at an interview of either </v>

3210
02:26:19.691 --> 02:26:23.081
<v Speaker 8>of them,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like on Saturday night live when they </v>

3211
02:26:23.081 --> 02:26:23.081
<v Speaker 8>just are guests.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They always have that vibe like,</v>

3212
02:26:23.081 --> 02:26:23.081
<v Speaker 8>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 8>had the gun.</v>

<v Speaker 6>You just made that up.</v>

3215
02:26:29.140 --> 02:26:31.690

<v Speaker 6>You're so ridiculous.</v>

3216
02:26:31.750 --> 02:26:35.330
<v Speaker 6>That version of homosexuality was so </v>
<v Speaker 6>fucking stereotypes.</v>

3217

<v Speaker 6>They don't happen to American list real </v>
<v Speaker 6>quick and then I'll.</v>

<v Speaker 8>David Bowie or Mick Jagger.</v>

02:26:52.670 --> 02:26:54.440
<v Speaker 8>What are you gonna look them up.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>

3220
02:26:54.900 --> 02:26:59.900
<v Speaker 8>you can show them.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Don't want to do it because they don't </v>

3221
02:26:59.900 --> 02:26:59.900
<v Speaker 8>get banned off of you two.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Don't get banned off of Youtube.</v>

3222
02:27:00.260 --> 02:27:05.260
<v Speaker 8>We're uploading some stuff off on the </v>
<v Speaker 8>youtube and if we do anything that has </v>

3223
02:27:05.260 --> 02:27:07.910
<v Speaker 8>like a video that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's a clip from a movie or some shit,</v>

3224
02:27:07.911 --> 02:27:10.330
<v Speaker 8>they'll get mad at us.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It was certainly,</v>

3225
02:27:10.750 --> 02:27:15.750
<v Speaker 8>definitely.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was going to play the Mick Jagger </v>

3226
02:27:15.750 --> 02:27:15.750
<v Speaker 8>Saturday night live skit where it's </v>
<v Speaker 8>just,</v>

3227
02:27:15.750 --> 02:27:17.010
<v Speaker 1>if anybody knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3228
02:27:17.430 --> 02:27:22.430
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a way where you can pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>a certain amount of money every month </v>

3229
02:27:22.430 --> 02:27:26.700
<v Speaker 1>and use music like as bumpers and stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that and use it and the,</v>

3230
02:27:26.760 --> 02:27:31.760
<v Speaker 1>the artists get paid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need to know what the best quality or </v>

3231
02:27:31.760 --> 02:27:35.880
<v Speaker 1>the best services for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If such a thing exists where the artists</v>

3232
02:27:35.881 --> 02:27:37.830
<v Speaker 1>actually get compensated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it must exist.</v>

3233
02:27:38.220 --> 02:27:43.220
<v Speaker 1>I think it would be nice if we could </v>
<v Speaker 1>find something like that where we could </v>

3234
02:27:43.220 --> 02:27:45.150
<v Speaker 1>know that when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3235
02:27:45.151 --> 02:27:48.330
<v Speaker 1>if we pay a certain amount of month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could play songs every now and</v>

3236
02:27:49.680 --> 02:27:51.650
<v Speaker 8>probably limited to like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>oh,</v>

3237
02:27:51.651 --> 02:27:53.910
<v Speaker 8>you can only play warner brothers songs,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3238
02:27:53.920 --> 02:27:55.220
<v Speaker 8>it will be.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Then it'd be just like,</v>

3239
02:27:55.221 --> 02:27:57.140
<v Speaker 8>what the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well we'll be in less.</v>

3240
02:27:57.190 --> 02:28:00.550
<v Speaker 1>We've paid for more than one service,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm willing to do.</v>

3241
02:28:00.551 --> 02:28:02.230
<v Speaker 1>I'll pay you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll pay for every service there is.</v>

3242
02:28:02.231 --> 02:28:07.231
<v Speaker 1>We could play everybody's shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean if it's only a few hundred </v>

3243
02:28:07.231 --> 02:28:07.390
<v Speaker 1>dollars a month or whatever it is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>month,</v>

3244
02:28:07.391 --> 02:28:08.890
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3245
02:28:09.180 --> 02:28:14.180
<v Speaker 8>Would like like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>why am I looking at a man's butt wiggle </v>

3246
02:28:14.180 --> 02:28:16.510
<v Speaker 8>back and forth?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Is that supposedly the reason why that's</v>

3247
02:28:16.900 --> 02:28:19.180
<v Speaker 8>entertaining with women is because it's </v>
<v Speaker 8>sexual.</v>

3248
02:28:19.300 --> 02:28:24.300
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 8>When you see a woman shaking her ass </v>

3249
02:28:24.300 --> 02:28:24.300
<v Speaker 8>back and forth,</v>

3250
02:28:24.300 --> 02:28:24.920
<v Speaker 1>you look at that and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck that.</v>

3251
02:28:25.130 --> 02:28:30.130
<v Speaker 1>When you see a man's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the band sticking his butt </v>

3252
02:28:30.130 --> 02:28:33.390
<v Speaker 1>outlet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is equally sexual and sexual in a </v>

3253
02:28:33.390 --> 02:28:34.550
<v Speaker 1>submissive homo sexual way,</v>

3254
02:28:35.230 --> 02:28:36.880
<v Speaker 11>Jesus,</v>
<v Speaker 11>her beds,</v>

3255
02:28:36.881 --> 02:28:41.881
<v Speaker 11>this type of behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 11>and you wonder why there's a meteor </v>

3256
02:28:41.881 --> 02:28:42.520
<v Speaker 11>shower scheduled for tonight.</v>

3257
02:28:44.180 --> 02:28:45.210
<v Speaker 1>That's gay as fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3258
02:28:45.211 --> 02:28:46.560
<v Speaker 1>That might be the gaze video on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>

3259
02:28:46.620 --> 02:28:48.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty up there.</v>

3260
02:28:48.070 --> 02:28:53.070
<v Speaker 1>It just implies a lot of gay sex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you guys think Paul Mccartney ever </v>

3261
02:28:53.070 --> 02:28:53.070
<v Speaker 1>had sex with Michael Jackson?</v>

3262
02:28:54.840 --> 02:28:55.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3263
02:28:56.040 --> 02:29:01.040
<v Speaker 1>I heard the most compelling and haunting</v>
<v Speaker 1>idea about Michael Jackson was that he </v>

3264
02:29:02.071 --> 02:29:05.100
<v Speaker 1>was castrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I heard that before.</v>

3265
02:29:05.400 --> 02:29:10.400
<v Speaker 1>That's a fucked up thing because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea is,</v>

3266
02:29:10.441 --> 02:29:12.810
<v Speaker 1>and this is some crazy horse shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3267
02:29:12.811 --> 02:29:17.811
<v Speaker 1>I don't even want to entertain this </v>
<v Speaker 1>other than the fact that there's things </v>

3268
02:29:17.811 --> 02:29:20.190
<v Speaker 1>called [inaudible] and pull this up </v>
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>

3269
02:29:20.191 --> 02:29:22.170
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want to hear some of this.</v>

3270
02:29:22.950 --> 02:29:27.950
<v Speaker 1>The castrati is a specific type of </v>
<v Speaker 1>performer that is castrated,</v>

3271
02:29:28.720 --> 02:29:32.420
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] to achieve a certain pitch </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's a man,</v>

3272
02:29:32.490 --> 02:29:37.490
<v Speaker 1>a male pitch mixed with the way a woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>Castrati like castrate,</v>

3273
02:29:39.420 --> 02:29:44.420
<v Speaker 1>not cal cal zone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3274
02:29:45.550 --> 02:29:47.820
<v Speaker 1>Castrati.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These were famous.</v>

3275
02:29:47.910 --> 02:29:52.910
<v Speaker 1>See that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the thing that guys holding up </v>

3276
02:29:52.910 --> 02:29:53.730
<v Speaker 1>that they're making fun of Justin Bieber</v>
<v Speaker 1>there saying he's a Castrati,</v>

3277
02:29:53.731 --> 02:29:58.731
<v Speaker 1>but in effect it's a very similar type </v>
<v Speaker 1>of sound that Justin Bieber makes </v>

3278
02:29:58.731 --> 02:30:02.150
<v Speaker 1>because Justin bieber's sound is made </v>
<v Speaker 1>because he doesn't have any.</v>

3279
02:30:02.170 --> 02:30:05.310
<v Speaker 1>Just astro and was young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This guy has a clipper that he's holding</v>

3280
02:30:05.311 --> 02:30:10.311
<v Speaker 1>up and that is the actual tool that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to use to cut your fucking balls </v>

3281
02:30:10.311 --> 02:30:14.511
<v Speaker 1>off to make you sing different and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would develop like this real kind of </v>

3282
02:30:14.511 --> 02:30:19.101
<v Speaker 1>like halfway feminine way of looking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they were Unix essentially,</v>

3283
02:30:19.320 --> 02:30:24.320
<v Speaker 1>but they did it on purpose to make them </v>
<v Speaker 1>sound a certain way when they sang.</v>

3284
02:30:25.710 --> 02:30:28.710
<v Speaker 1>And it's really fucking hard to believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's real,</v>

3285
02:30:28.860 --> 02:30:30.270
<v Speaker 1>but it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you,</v>

3286
02:30:30.300 --> 02:30:32.340
<v Speaker 1>if you google it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

3287
02:30:32.341 --> 02:30:36.640
<v Speaker 1>sounds of a Castrati,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can hear them singing and it's so.</v>

3288
02:30:36.780 --> 02:30:40.950
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird sound that they do,</v>

3289
02:30:40.951 --> 02:30:41.400
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3290
02:30:44.330 --> 02:30:45.430
<v Speaker 7>The thing,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Michael Jackson,</v>

3291
02:30:45.431 --> 02:30:50.431
<v Speaker 7>they one thing with him,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like when he was up for that trial and </v>

3292
02:30:50.431 --> 02:30:53.821
<v Speaker 7>the cops arrested him,</v>
<v Speaker 7>like when the plane landed and you </v>

3293
02:30:53.821 --> 02:30:54.640
<v Speaker 7>complain about how they handled him,</v>

3294
02:30:55.480 --> 02:30:59.680
<v Speaker 1>search dominated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>touched his penis.</v>

3295
02:31:02.540 --> 02:31:05.100
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if his balls was admitted,</v>

3296
02:31:05.320 --> 02:31:07.960
<v Speaker 1>having a penis back there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they were extracted,</v>

3297
02:31:08.790 --> 02:31:10.970
<v Speaker 1>castrating doesn't mean they cut your </v>
<v Speaker 1>dick off the ball.</v>

3298
02:31:11.040 --> 02:31:13.330
<v Speaker 1>They cut your balls off and they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even have to cut your balls off.</v>

3299
02:31:13.360 --> 02:31:18.360
<v Speaker 1>They can just snip them and pulled a </v>

3322
02:32:21.010 --> 02:32:21.330
<v Speaker 5>back in the eighties because everyone </v>
<v Speaker 5>loved Michael Jackson so much,</v>

3323
02:32:21.360 --> 02:32:26.360
<v Speaker 5>but it was like,</v>

3324
02:32:26.360 --> 02:32:28.331

<v Speaker 5>Jackson is having an arm wrestling </v>

<v Speaker 1>What a weird time in history.</v>

3331
02:32:51.881 --> 02:32:55.710
<v Speaker 1>That must've been around for centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 16 hundreds,</v>

3332
02:32:55.900 --> 02:33:00.410
<v Speaker 1>1600 to 1750.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called the Baroque period that mean</v>

<v Speaker 1>their,</v>

02:33:21.760 --> 02:33:25.810
<v Speaker 1>They also had more developed </v>
<v Speaker 1>subcutaneous fat and the normal male fat</v>

3343
02:33:34.110 --> 02:33:35.740
<v Speaker 1>swollen because they had no testosterone</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever.</v>

3344
02:33:36.080 --> 02:33:38.590
<v Speaker 1>The arms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the legs of many Castrati were unusually</v>

3345
02:33:38.591 --> 02:33:42.130
<v Speaker 1>long as compared to their torso.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The long bones never stopped growing,</v>

3346
02:33:42.131 --> 02:33:45.070
<v Speaker 1>which made them look distorted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>

<v Speaker 5>fat,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they hold that much fat.</v>
