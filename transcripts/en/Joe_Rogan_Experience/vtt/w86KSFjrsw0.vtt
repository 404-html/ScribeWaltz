150
00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.850
<v Speaker 1>But it's not orally active cause it's in so many different plants that if you,</v>

151
00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.420
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

152
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.430
<v Speaker 1>if you got it orally from eating it,</v>

153
00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:09.970
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

154
00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.690
<v Speaker 1>you people would go on DMT trips all the time because it's an all sorts of</v>

155
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:18.510
<v Speaker 1>different grasses and plants and usually in a combin atory,</v>

156
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:19.000
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

157
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.500
<v Speaker 1>state with a bunch of other,</v>

158
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:21.101
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

159
00:04:21.101 --> 00:04:25.270
<v Speaker 1>whether they're active or non psychoactive ingredients.</v>

160
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.980
<v Speaker 1>Like some plants actually contain five methoxy Diane dimethyl trip doing,</v>

161
00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:34.981
<v Speaker 1>which is another form of DMT that's a justice I should actually more powerful</v>

162
00:04:35.531 --> 00:04:39.010
<v Speaker 1>but unique and different than the regular DMT experience.</v>

163
00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:40.900
<v Speaker 1>But we're getting off track.</v>

164
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.060
<v Speaker 1>This W IOWASCA is,</v>

165
00:04:43.061 --> 00:04:48.061
<v Speaker 1>is the Shamans of South America figured out and no one knows how long ago they</v>

166
00:04:48.131 --> 00:04:48.790
<v Speaker 1>figured this out,</v>

167
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.230
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a thousand years,</v>

168
00:04:50.231 --> 00:04:51.190
<v Speaker 1>10,000 years,</v>

169
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.770
<v Speaker 1>it's all guesswork because there's no written history of it.</v>

170
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.020
<v Speaker 1>They figured out how to combine the reason why it's not orally active as your</v>

171
00:04:59.021 --> 00:05:02.170
<v Speaker 1>stomach produces something called mono aiming oxidase.</v>

172
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.740
<v Speaker 1>And that breaks down dimethyl trip to mean in the oral form.</v>

173
00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:08.170
<v Speaker 1>So once it gets to your stomach where any,</v>

174
00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:09.191
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

175
00:05:09.191 --> 00:05:11.410
<v Speaker 1>we're were like marijuana when you eat it,</v>

176
00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:12.970
<v Speaker 1>it would get into your bloodstream.</v>

177
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:14.260
<v Speaker 1>What can cause the motto?</v>

178
00:05:14.261 --> 00:05:15.640
<v Speaker 1>Aiming oxidase crushes it.</v>

179
00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.680
<v Speaker 1>So what they figured out how to do is take the route of one plant,</v>

180
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.560
<v Speaker 1>the leaves of one plant and the vine of another plant.</v>

181
00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:25.050
<v Speaker 4>And they don't even grow near each other.</v>

182
00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:27.430
<v Speaker 4>They're on other completely other parts.</v>

183
00:05:27.431 --> 00:05:27.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

184
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.090
<v Speaker 1>the Dongle.</v>

185
00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:33.090
<v Speaker 1>And there's over a hundred thousand different types of plants in the jungle.</v>

186
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.940
<v Speaker 1>So the fact that they figured out how to do this and thousands of years ago,</v>

187
00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.350
<v Speaker 1>and when you ask them,</v>

188
00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.840
<v Speaker 1>who knows if they're telling you the truth,</v>

189
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:44.380
<v Speaker 1>but what they say is that the plants taught them how to do that.</v>

190
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.180
<v Speaker 4>They look at you like you're a big dummy.</v>

191
00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:47.800
<v Speaker 4>When you asking me like how did you,</v>

192
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:49.250
<v Speaker 4>how did you find that out?</v>

193
00:05:49.251 --> 00:05:49.960
<v Speaker 4>And they're like,</v>

194
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:50.600
<v Speaker 4>they told us.</v>

195
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.250
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

196
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:51.491
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

197
00:05:51.491 --> 00:05:54.340
<v Speaker 4>it's like that matter of fact when you're talking to the real deal down there,</v>

198
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:54.911
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

199
00:05:54.911 --> 00:05:57.650
<v Speaker 4>it's not like they come up with an elaborate story.</v>

200
00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.640
<v Speaker 4>They just look at you like,</v>

201
00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.050
<v Speaker 4>well obviously they told us how he,</v>

202
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:01.640
<v Speaker 4>you think drink,</v>

203
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.473
<v Speaker 4>we just guessed,</v>

204
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:03.021
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

205
00:06:03.021 --> 00:06:03.810
<v Speaker 4>like come on,</v>

206
00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:04.650
<v Speaker 1>they told you.</v>

207
00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:05.401
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

208
00:06:05.401 --> 00:06:06.211
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

209
00:06:06.211 --> 00:06:07.360
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be a,</v>

210
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:08.970
<v Speaker 1>an actual possibility.</v>

211
00:06:08.971 --> 00:06:13.830
<v Speaker 1>That to me is more likely than they figured it out through trial and error.</v>

212
00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:14.910
<v Speaker 1>The combination there,</v>

213
00:06:14.911 --> 00:06:15.330
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

214
00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.541
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

215
00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:16.140
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

216
00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:17.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a math unless cyber guy,</v>

217
00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.620
<v Speaker 1>but it also could be evidence of an ancient civilization that figured out,</v>

218
00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:22.981
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

219
00:06:22.981 --> 00:06:26.760
<v Speaker 1>plant pharmacology thousands and thousands of years before.</v>

220
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.840
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure there's a lot of medicines that are you putting two different things</v>

221
00:06:29.841 --> 00:06:31.790
<v Speaker 4>that had nothing to do with each other together.</v>

222
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:33.523
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

223
00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:35.270
<v Speaker 4>there's one particular one called Cura,</v>

224
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.931
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

225
00:06:35.931 --> 00:06:38.660
<v Speaker 4>which they use and if they don't do it exactly the right way,</v>

226
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:39.800
<v Speaker 4>it's a deadly,</v>

227
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.113
<v Speaker 4>deadly,</v>

228
00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.200
<v Speaker 4>toxic poison.</v>

229
00:06:42.201 --> 00:06:43.670
<v Speaker 4>But the way that they're able to do it,</v>

230
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:44.690
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

231
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:45.380
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

232
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.080
<v Speaker 4>it's just pretty miraculous that punching people haven't died.</v>

233
00:06:48.081 --> 00:06:49.190
<v Speaker 4>So there's plenty of examples.</v>

234
00:06:49.191 --> 00:06:49.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

235
00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:50.170
<v Speaker 1>it's a,</v>

236
00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:51.090
<v Speaker 1>what is curare?</v>

237
00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.180
<v Speaker 1>Is it an medicine?</v>

238
00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.121
<v Speaker 4>I think it's a,</v>

239
00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:54.350
<v Speaker 4>I think that's the medicine,</v>

240
00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:54.771
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

241
00:06:54.771 --> 00:06:55.640
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a,</v>

242
00:06:55.641 --> 00:06:57.610
<v Speaker 4>it's the way that they prepare it and uh,</v>

243
00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:02.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't know some shit that they would put on poison darts and shooting.</v>

244
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:02.790
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>

245
00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:03.623
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I have that.</v>

246
00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.530
<v Speaker 1>I don't know because I'm thinking I'm only going from like Tarzan.</v>

247
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:08.053
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

248
00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.740
<v Speaker 4>maybe that is the poison dart thing,</v>

249
00:07:09.741 --> 00:07:10.810
<v Speaker 4>but you know how to spell it.</v>

250
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:11.500
<v Speaker 4>How do you spell it?</v>

251
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:12.340
<v Speaker 4>You are a</v>

252
00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.530
<v Speaker 1>e c u r a r e</v>

253
00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:18.370
<v Speaker 4>thing with the preparation.</v>

254
00:07:18.371 --> 00:07:19.390
<v Speaker 4>I think of it where if they,</v>

255
00:07:19.391 --> 00:07:20.530
<v Speaker 4>if they did it wrong,</v>

256
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:21.190
<v Speaker 1>Bam.</v>

257
00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.540
<v Speaker 1>Nasad for common name for various Arrow poisons.</v>

258
00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:24.871
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

259
00:07:24.871 --> 00:07:26.790
<v Speaker 1>So that's originating in South America.</v>

260
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:27.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

261
00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.190
<v Speaker 1>I guess if you do it right,</v>

262
00:07:29.191 --> 00:07:33.240
<v Speaker 1>it kills people maybe with the boys or something like that.</v>

263
00:07:33.241 --> 00:07:34.230
<v Speaker 1>But the point is,</v>

264
00:07:34.231 --> 00:07:38.310
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing that these people figured out long before we,</v>

265
00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:39.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

266
00:07:39.001 --> 00:07:43.050
<v Speaker 1>wherever driving cars or sending emails,</v>

267
00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:48.060
<v Speaker 1>they figured out how to combine these two plants and make an orally active</v>

268
00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:53.070
<v Speaker 1>version of dimethyltryptamine that in the words of the showman connects you to</v>

269
00:07:53.071 --> 00:07:54.090
<v Speaker 1>the spirit world.</v>

270
00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:59.570
<v Speaker 1>And the idea is that there is a world that is all around us all the time,</v>

271
00:07:59.911 --> 00:08:01.380
<v Speaker 1>but we just cannot tune into it.</v>

272
00:08:01.381 --> 00:08:06.381
<v Speaker 1>And it is a world of souls and it is a world of the afterlife and is a world of</v>

273
00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.250
<v Speaker 1>non in bodied entities that are to the experience or to the,</v>

274
00:08:11.251 --> 00:08:15.420
<v Speaker 1>to the subjective person that's having these experience there as real,</v>

275
00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.060
<v Speaker 1>if not more real than this life itself.</v>

276
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:19.130
<v Speaker 4>I was their brother,</v>

277
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.210
<v Speaker 4>I saw it.</v>

278
00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:24.050
<v Speaker 4>I mean I was in it and it was completely indisputable for me.</v>

279
00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.660
<v Speaker 4>And that was what was so life changing.</v>

280
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:26.710
<v Speaker 1>What was indisputable?</v>

281
00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.030
<v Speaker 1>Tell us what happened.</v>

282
00:08:28.031 --> 00:08:32.400
<v Speaker 1>You go down there and so you got to write a whole thing to get in there.</v>

283
00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:32.830
<v Speaker 1>What happened?</v>

284
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:33.850
<v Speaker 1>So it's kind of a school</v>

285
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:36.960
<v Speaker 4>I've been studying and training and,</v>

286
00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:37.620
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

287
00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:41.220
<v Speaker 4>going to classes and things led by a master showman who's found out the best in</v>

288
00:08:41.221 --> 00:08:41.910
<v Speaker 4>South America,</v>

289
00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:45.840
<v Speaker 4>learned from him for 30 years and is now trying to teach people here in the u s</v>

290
00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:46.711
<v Speaker 4>about it.</v>

291
00:08:46.711 --> 00:08:47.220
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

292
00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:47.400

<v Speaker 4>in order to get into this,</v>

294
00:08:48.391 --> 00:08:50.010
<v Speaker 4>this is kind of like the masterclass here.</v>

00:08:54.301 --> 00:08:56.610
<v Speaker 4>So in to get admitted I had to write,</v>

301
00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:03.430

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.130
<v Speaker 4>Decent size plant.</v>

355
00:10:14.131 --> 00:10:14.964
<v Speaker 4>I've got a lot.</v>

356
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.000
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

357
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:16.190
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

358
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:16.331
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

359
00:10:16.331 --> 00:10:17.060
<v Speaker 4>I had a real job.</v>

360
00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:17.550
<v Speaker 4>It was a jet.</v>

361
00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:17.781
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

362
00:10:17.781 --> 00:10:18.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

363
00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.030
<v Speaker 4>But then we take a,</v>

364
00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:20.280
<v Speaker 4>then we take a canoe,</v>

365
00:10:20.281 --> 00:10:21.180
<v Speaker 4>a two hour canoe.</v>

366
00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:21.541
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

367
00:10:21.541 --> 00:10:23.040
<v Speaker 4>we arrived at credit mall and it's like a,</v>

368
00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:25.170
<v Speaker 4>I'll tell you to go fuck yourself.</v>

369
00:10:25.950 --> 00:10:27.450
<v Speaker 4>It's like a real third world country.</v>

370
00:10:27.451 --> 00:10:28.200
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's just,</v>

371
00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.960
<v Speaker 4>you smell feces and fish and smiling happy people,</v>

372
00:10:30.961 --> 00:10:34.920
<v Speaker 4>but it's like dust and diesel fuel and it's one of those places to our canoe</v>

373
00:10:35.130 --> 00:10:36.440
<v Speaker 4>just into the middle of nowhere.</v>

374
00:10:36.441 --> 00:10:37.530
<v Speaker 4>Like on the Amazon,</v>

375
00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.011
<v Speaker 4>Amazon,</v>

376
00:10:38.011 --> 00:10:39.450
<v Speaker 4>the Madre de Dios river.</v>

377
00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.470
<v Speaker 4>Since I've been watching a lot of that Jeremy Wade's river monsters.</v>

378
00:10:43.471 --> 00:10:46.700
<v Speaker 4>So I'm just looking at this muddy brown water thinking of these way.</v>

379
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:50.930
<v Speaker 4>He that burrow through people flash and soft fish and all those things he's</v>

380
00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:51.773
<v Speaker 4>pulled out of there.</v>

381
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.350
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

382
00:10:52.350 --> 00:10:52.740
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

383
00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:53.780
<v Speaker 4>three hours up is,</v>

384
00:10:53.810 --> 00:10:54.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

385
00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.740
<v Speaker 4>two and a half or so up the,</v>

386
00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:57.170
<v Speaker 4>up the river to this place.</v>

387
00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:01.530
<v Speaker 4>It was just this eco lodge running on generators out in the middle of the jungle</v>

388
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:03.570
<v Speaker 4>and generators that are fueled by,</v>

389
00:11:03.571 --> 00:11:04.860
<v Speaker 4>is it bio diesel?</v>

390
00:11:04.861 --> 00:11:06.320
<v Speaker 4>Like how do they straight diesel out?</v>

391
00:11:06.330 --> 00:11:07.950
<v Speaker 4>Just get it from a source.</v>

392
00:11:07.951 --> 00:11:09.420
<v Speaker 4>Do you have a truck come by and deliver it?</v>

393
00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:13.620
<v Speaker 4>They have one big ship comes up the river and degenerate is on for a certain</v>

394
00:11:13.621 --> 00:11:14.040
<v Speaker 4>amount of time,</v>

395
00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:14.910
<v Speaker 4>about three hours,</v>

396
00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:15.960
<v Speaker 4>three hours at a time.</v>

397
00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:16.570
<v Speaker 4>So the hours,</v>

398
00:11:16.570 --> 00:11:17.480
<v Speaker 4>refrigerators?</v>

399
00:11:17.770 --> 00:11:18.510
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

400
00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:18.751
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

401
00:11:18.751 --> 00:11:20.070
<v Speaker 4>not good ones I guess.</v>

402
00:11:20.071 --> 00:11:20.970
<v Speaker 4>But the food was great,</v>

403
00:11:20.971 --> 00:11:21.510
<v Speaker 4>so I didn't,</v>

404
00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:22.650
<v Speaker 4>I didn't really probe too deeply.</v>

405
00:11:22.651 --> 00:11:26.310
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they keep the kitchen part on generation more,</v>

406
00:11:26.311 --> 00:11:29.580
<v Speaker 4>but the lights and everything like that that we got about two and a half hours a</v>

407
00:11:29.581 --> 00:11:30.090
<v Speaker 4>day.</v>

408
00:11:30.090 --> 00:11:30.860
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

409
00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:31.230
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

410
00:11:31.230 --> 00:11:34.500
<v Speaker 4>So at nighttime it was just dark as fuck and right when you'd start the</v>

411
00:11:34.501 --> 00:11:35.041
<v Speaker 4>ceremony,</v>

412
00:11:35.041 --> 00:11:37.050
<v Speaker 4>that's when the lights would kick and it just boom.</v>

413
00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.580
<v Speaker 4>And then with the canopies above,</v>

414
00:11:38.581 --> 00:11:39.990
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's just cave black.</v>

415
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:43.530
<v Speaker 4>Now do they have to worry about Jaguars that they do,</v>

416
00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.470
<v Speaker 4>but the Jaguars is a very sacred animal to them,</v>

417
00:11:46.471 --> 00:11:46.711
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

418
00:11:46.711 --> 00:11:48.380
<v Speaker 4>so it's cool.</v>

419
00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:49.260
<v Speaker 4>Right,</v>

420
00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:49.770
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

421
00:11:49.770 --> 00:11:51.770
<v Speaker 4>Well they believe that that's what happens to us when we,</v>

422
00:11:51.771 --> 00:11:52.310
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

423
00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:53.400
<v Speaker 4>once he die anyways,</v>

424
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 4>you ain't sacred</v>

425
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:54.461
<v Speaker 5>to them,</v>

426
00:11:54.461 --> 00:11:54.731
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

427
00:11:54.731 --> 00:11:55.480
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you that.</v>

428
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:55.750
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

429
00:11:55.750 --> 00:11:59.800
<v Speaker 5>they have a totally different fucking game plan they're playing with totally</v>

430
00:11:59.801 --> 00:12:00.680
<v Speaker 5>different rule book.</v>

431
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:00.910
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

432
00:12:00.910 --> 00:12:04.210
<v Speaker 5>But there was Jaguar tracks while we were there and some of the places we were</v>

433
00:12:04.211 --> 00:12:04.750
<v Speaker 5>hiking,</v>

434
00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:06.430
<v Speaker 5>God damn son,</v>

435
00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:09.010
<v Speaker 5>Jaguars are like mountain lions on steroids.</v>

436
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.410
<v Speaker 5>There's quote Ninja Ninja,</v>

437
00:12:11.411 --> 00:12:12.140
<v Speaker 5>mountain lions.</v>

<v Speaker 5>That organized?</v>

501
00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:38.040
<v Speaker 5>It's organized.</v>

502
00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:38.320
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

503
00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:40.150
<v Speaker 5>There was like 50 of us going down there.</v>

504
00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:40.600
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

505
00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:40.811
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

506
00:13:40.811 --> 00:13:42.580
<v Speaker 5>It was a big troop man.</v>

507
00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:46.240
<v Speaker 5>See that would trip me out like getting blasted with a bunch of Weirdos that I</v>

508
00:13:46.241 --> 00:13:47.110
<v Speaker 5>didn't know it was,</v>

509
00:13:47.111 --> 00:13:47.861
<v Speaker 5>it was interesting.</v>

510
00:13:47.861 --> 00:13:49.210
<v Speaker 5>They were all super good natured,</v>

511
00:13:49.211 --> 00:13:51.640
<v Speaker 5>but this is not the crew that I would bring on board.</v>

512
00:13:51.641 --> 00:13:52.900
<v Speaker 5>Like I see where the vessel,</v>

513
00:13:52.901 --> 00:13:53.710
<v Speaker 5>if I was going to,</v>

514
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:54.450
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

515
00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:55.630
<v Speaker 5>lots of broken people.</v>

516
00:13:55.631 --> 00:13:56.230
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

517
00:13:56.230 --> 00:13:59.200
<v Speaker 5>I think they started that way and this was an answer for a lot of people,</v>

518
00:13:59.230 --> 00:13:59.770
<v Speaker 5>but you know,</v>

519
00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:01.060
<v Speaker 5>genuinely good people.</v>

520
00:14:01.061 --> 00:14:01.320
<v Speaker 5>I was,</v>

521
00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:05.650
<v Speaker 5>I was impressed to see that they weren't a lot of these super kind of fraudulent</v>

522
00:14:05.651 --> 00:14:06.970
<v Speaker 5>pseudo spiritual,</v>

523
00:14:07.030 --> 00:14:07.540
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

524
00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:08.890
<v Speaker 5>I'm so connected,</v>

525
00:14:08.891 --> 00:14:09.071
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

526
00:14:09.071 --> 00:14:10.450
<v Speaker 5>they were like really good people.</v>

527
00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:11.080
<v Speaker 5>Like they were,</v>

528
00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:12.010
<v Speaker 5>they were out to help you.</v>

529
00:14:12.011 --> 00:14:12.844
<v Speaker 5>But they,</v>

530
00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:13.620
<v Speaker 5>there's,</v>

531
00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:14.000
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>

532
00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.850
<v Speaker 5>there's like the saltiest crew.</v>

533
00:14:15.851 --> 00:14:19.000
<v Speaker 5>I would say that element of insincerity is,</v>

534
00:14:19.001 --> 00:14:19.350
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

535
00:14:19.350 --> 00:14:22.960
<v Speaker 5>is really one of the biggest problems with human beings.</v>

536
00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.210
<v Speaker 5>And in a sense,</v>

537
00:14:25.211 --> 00:14:26.110
<v Speaker 5>a lot of people,</v>

538
00:14:26.111 --> 00:14:26.980
<v Speaker 5>whatever you become,</v>

539
00:14:26.981 --> 00:14:27.491
<v Speaker 5>anything,</v>

540
00:14:27.491 --> 00:14:29.140
<v Speaker 5>you got to fake it before you make it.</v>

541
00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:29.801
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

542
00:14:29.801 --> 00:14:30.041
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

543
00:14:30.041 --> 00:14:32.320
<v Speaker 5>I've had this conversation with my friends about comics that are,</v>

544
00:14:32.321 --> 00:14:33.910
<v Speaker 5>comics are just starting out and like the,</v>

545
00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:34.090
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

546
00:14:34.090 --> 00:14:35.860
<v Speaker 5>let's not fucking colligate is fucking terrible.</v>

547
00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:36.251
<v Speaker 5>I'm like,</v>

548
00:14:36.251 --> 00:14:36.731
<v Speaker 5>God damn,</v>

549
00:14:36.731 --> 00:14:36.881
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

550
00:14:36.881 --> 00:14:38.320
<v Speaker 5>if you saw me a weekend to my act,</v>

551
00:14:38.321 --> 00:14:39.400
<v Speaker 5>you would want to kill me too.</v>

552
00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:39.851
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

553
00:14:39.851 --> 00:14:40.601
<v Speaker 5>I was a faker.</v>

554
00:14:40.601 --> 00:14:42.460
<v Speaker 5>I was a faker until it became a comic.</v>

555
00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.250
<v Speaker 5>But there's something about the spiritual thing.</v>

556
00:14:45.251 --> 00:14:49.740
<v Speaker 5>It's like faking spirituality is one of the grossest thing.</v>

557
00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:52.010
<v Speaker 5>It's even grosser faking being a</v>

558
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:52.843
<v Speaker 1>rock star.</v>

559
00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:53.211
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

560
00:14:53.211 --> 00:14:56.330
<v Speaker 1>like if you're in fucking high school and you're wearing black nail Polish and</v>

561
00:14:56.331 --> 00:14:57.530
<v Speaker 1>you're growing your hair long,</v>

562
00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:58.750
<v Speaker 1>you decide to like fake,</v>

563
00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.160
<v Speaker 1>like you're a rockstar until you become a rock star.</v>

564
00:15:01.161 --> 00:15:01.671
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

565
00:15:01.671 --> 00:15:04.150
<v Speaker 1>Well cause faking to be a rockstar actually helps you to be a rock.</v>

566
00:15:04.151 --> 00:15:06.950
<v Speaker 1>Start faking to be spiritual actually prevents you from being spiritual.</v>

567
00:15:06.951 --> 00:15:07.784
<v Speaker 1>So it's,</v>

568
00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:10.200
<v Speaker 1>it's the opposite that isn't going to see it.</v>

569
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:11.233
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

570
00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.170
<v Speaker 1>Spirituality has so much to do at true humility.</v>

571
00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:15.950
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

572
00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:19.130
<v Speaker 1>And not worrying about your fucking image and the,</v>

573
00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:19.401
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

574
00:15:19.401 --> 00:15:24.401
<v Speaker 1>the real issue with fake spiritual is fake spirituality is that it's all about</v>

575
00:15:24.591 --> 00:15:25.370
<v Speaker 1>the image.</v>

576
00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:30.370
<v Speaker 1>It's all about projecting this artificial piety,</v>

577
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:31.880
<v Speaker 1>this artificial,</v>

578
00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:32.843
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

579
00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:33.681
<v Speaker 1>sense of,</v>

580
00:15:33.681 --> 00:15:34.040
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

581
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:34.550
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

582
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:38.930
<v Speaker 1>it's like vegans that get real uppity with you about Ken animals.</v>

583
00:15:38.931 --> 00:15:41.960
<v Speaker 1>It's like what they're really doing is they're taking a moral high ground.</v>

584
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.580
<v Speaker 1>They're taking a ground,</v>

585
00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:44.510
<v Speaker 1>they're taking,</v>

586
00:15:44.510 --> 00:15:47.270
<v Speaker 1>whether it's a Christian ground or the spiritual ground,</v>

587
00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:49.130
<v Speaker 1>they're pretending to be above you,</v>

588
00:15:49.490 --> 00:15:49.791
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

589
00:15:49.791 --> 00:15:53.120
<v Speaker 1>And they'll do it with this spirituality or there.</v>

590
00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:54.950
<v Speaker 1>I think now that I've gotten down there,</v>

600
00:16:12.651 --> 00:16:14.000

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:32.870
<v Speaker 1>And she was like,</v>

620
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:33.081
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

00:16:33.081 --> 00:16:37.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm from out of state and I'm really not that happy with California.</v>

622
00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:38.780
<v Speaker 1>And she was like real uppity.</v>

623
00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:39.883

626
00:16:41.301 --> 00:16:41.870

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:42.230
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

628
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.860
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

629
00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:45.260
<v Speaker 1>there's just a lack of spirituality here.</v>

630
00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:47.660
<v Speaker 1>And I don't think that,</v>

631
00:16:47.661 --> 00:16:48.494
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

632
00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:49.910
<v Speaker 1>the men are very godlike.</v>

633
00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:51.200
<v Speaker 1>That's what she actually said.</v>

634
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.480
<v Speaker 1>She actually said they're not very godlike.</v>

635
00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:54.081
<v Speaker 1>And we were like,</v>

636
00:16:54.081 --> 00:16:54.620
<v Speaker 1>and I know,</v>

637
00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:56.100
<v Speaker 1>and I was like right there with them.</v>

638
00:16:56.101 --> 00:16:56.361
<v Speaker 1>It was like,</v>

639
00:16:56.361 --> 00:16:57.970
<v Speaker 1>she said like,</v>

640
00:16:57.971 --> 00:16:58.220
<v Speaker 1>I want,</v>

641
00:16:58.220 --> 00:17:00.350
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to start making fun of her,</v>

642
00:17:00.351 --> 00:17:02.900
<v Speaker 1>but he says he's trying to get laid so I'm being cool.</v>

643
00:17:02.901 --> 00:17:03.890
<v Speaker 1>And I back off and I'm like,</v>

644
00:17:04.310 --> 00:17:04.850
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

645
00:17:04.850 --> 00:17:05.541
<v Speaker 1>Oh God.</v>

646
00:17:05.541 --> 00:17:06.630
<v Speaker 1>And then we're over work it out.</v>

647
00:17:06.631 --> 00:17:07.041
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

648
00:17:07.041 --> 00:17:09.830
<v Speaker 1>she didn't say God's like the men are not God.</v>

649
00:17:09.830 --> 00:17:10.520
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

650
00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:10.760
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

651
00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:12.260
<v Speaker 1>I guess what she was saying was like,</v>

652
00:17:12.261 --> 00:17:12.451
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

653
00:17:12.451 --> 00:17:14.000
<v Speaker 1>like living by the word of God.</v>

654
00:17:14.001 --> 00:17:14.720
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

655
00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.710
<v Speaker 1>long story short,</v>

656
00:17:15.830 --> 00:17:19.280
<v Speaker 1>a week later we at the spearmint Rhino Strip club in Van Nuys,</v>

657
00:17:19.281 --> 00:17:20.114
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>

658
00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:22.370
<v Speaker 1>who takes the stage right in front of us,</v>

659
00:17:22.490 --> 00:17:23.900
<v Speaker 1>but God like,</v>

660
00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:24.923
<v Speaker 1>are you serious?</v>

661
00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:28.310
<v Speaker 1>Like in the all nudes trip club with her hot little body.</v>

662
00:17:28.311 --> 00:17:33.020
<v Speaker 1>We'll look at a right at our little asshole and she looks at us and the fucking</v>

663
00:17:33.021 --> 00:17:33.950
<v Speaker 1>poor girl,</v>

664
00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.790
<v Speaker 1>she remembered us from the gym and she remembered that that was the day that she</v>

665
00:17:37.791 --> 00:17:40.580
<v Speaker 1>had probably chosen to try out this new persona.</v>

666
00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:40.970
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

667
00:17:40.970 --> 00:17:41.840
<v Speaker 1>crazy strippers.</v>

668
00:17:41.841 --> 00:17:45.200
<v Speaker 1>One day they're super religious and one day they're fucking spiritual.</v>

669
00:17:45.201 --> 00:17:47.360
<v Speaker 1>The next day they're going to be a yoga teacher.</v>

670
00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:48.440
<v Speaker 1>Now they're fucking lost.</v>

671
00:17:48.441 --> 00:17:49.230
<v Speaker 1>That's why they're stripping.</v>

672
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:50.190
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't God like,</v>

673
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:51.870
<v Speaker 3>like perfect body face,</v>

674
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:53.100
<v Speaker 3>everything like that.</v>

675
00:17:53.101 --> 00:17:54.190
<v Speaker 3>Like not religious neither.</v>

676
00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:54.441
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

677
00:17:54.441 --> 00:17:55.274
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

678
00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:56.370
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

679
00:17:56.370 --> 00:17:56.970
<v Speaker 5>She was,</v>

680
00:17:56.970 --> 00:17:57.240
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

681
00:17:57.240 --> 00:17:57.431
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

682
00:17:57.431 --> 00:17:57.590
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

683
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.741

00:17:57.741 --> 00:17:57.861
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

685
00:17:57.861 --> 00:17:57.991
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

686
00:17:57.991 --> 00:17:58.990
<v Speaker 5>It was clearly,</v>

687
00:17:58.991 --> 00:18:01.210
<v Speaker 5>she was talking about spirituality first she said,</v>

688
00:18:01.211 --> 00:18:02.050
<v Speaker 5>men aren't spiritual.</v>

689
00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:03.460
<v Speaker 5>And then she said they're not very god.</v>

690
00:18:03.461 --> 00:18:06.940
<v Speaker 5>Like she was talking about the people aren't spiritual in California and that</v>

691
00:18:06.941 --> 00:18:09.070
<v Speaker 5>she's from a place where people are,</v>

692
00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:09.400
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

693
00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.280
<v Speaker 5>much more in tune with the way of God.</v>

694
00:18:12.281 --> 00:18:13.570
<v Speaker 5>But it was hilarious.</v>

695
00:18:13.571 --> 00:18:14.650
<v Speaker 5>Step clubs in the VAT,</v>

696

698
00:18:18.881 --> 00:18:19.900
<v Speaker 5>This shit is hard core.</v>

699
00:18:19.901 --> 00:18:22.450
<v Speaker 5>This is a pussies and assholes in your face.</v>

700
00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:22.931

701
00:18:22.931 --> 00:18:23.470
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

702
00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:26.390
<v Speaker 5>equivalent or butt and doing that thing when they shake their butt up and down.</v>

703
00:18:26.391 --> 00:18:26.890

<v Speaker 5>that's fig spiritual.</v>

708
00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.040
<v Speaker 5>So you're in the jungle.</v>

709
00:18:33.041 --> 00:18:34.690
<v Speaker 5>There's no fake spiritual people.</v>

710
00:18:34.691 --> 00:18:35.540
<v Speaker 5>It's all genuine,</v>

711
00:18:36.340 --> 00:18:36.760
<v Speaker 4>but it's,</v>

712
00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:40.990
<v Speaker 4>it's like a very high percentage of really any hot chicks out there.</v>

713

<v Speaker 4>there was something that took care of themselves and,</v>

00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:02.860
<v Speaker 3>Traveled the world.</v>

733
00:19:02.860 --> 00:19:03.700
<v Speaker 3>No Shit.</v>

734
00:19:03.701 --> 00:19:04.534
<v Speaker 3>I know that for sure.</v>

735
00:19:04.570 --> 00:19:05.261
<v Speaker 3>Wow,</v>

736
00:19:05.261 --> 00:19:06.071
<v Speaker 3>that's amazing.</v>

737
00:19:06.071 --> 00:19:08.350
<v Speaker 3>So she has a mobster gangster shit.</v>

738
00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:11.260
<v Speaker 3>My mom would get annoying after a couple of days in Peru.</v>

739
00:19:11.261 --> 00:19:13.900
<v Speaker 3>I could tell tough action.</v>

740
00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:15.810
<v Speaker 3>My mom is somewhere along the lines,</v>

741
00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:17.080
<v Speaker 5>become a five year old.</v>

742
00:19:17.770 --> 00:19:19.150
<v Speaker 5>Explain everything to her mom.</v>

743
00:19:19.151 --> 00:19:20.730
<v Speaker 5>That's fake is,</v>

744
00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.570
<v Speaker 5>that's a commercial what?</v>

745
00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.030
<v Speaker 5>She'll send me things and he,</v>

746
00:19:24.031 --> 00:19:24.970
<v Speaker 5>can you believe this?</v>

747
00:19:24.971 --> 00:19:25.301
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

748
00:19:25.301 --> 00:19:26.740
<v Speaker 5>I can't because it's not real.</v>

749
00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:28.143
<v Speaker 5>It's Bruce Lee.</v>

750
00:19:28.900 --> 00:19:31.000
<v Speaker 5>Have you seen this?</v>

751
00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:31.960
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

752
00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:35.530
<v Speaker 5>but I don't think it'd be down with going into the spirit world with her.</v>

753
00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:40.210
<v Speaker 5>We were in a bus going off a cliff and I have no choice</v>

754
00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:43.540
<v Speaker 5>then we're taking that trip together.</v>

755
00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:44.470
<v Speaker 5>But until then,</v>

756
00:19:44.830 --> 00:19:45.251
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

757
00:19:45.251 --> 00:19:45.880
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

758
00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.290
<v Speaker 5>you get down there with your mom,</v>

759
00:19:47.291 --> 00:19:48.310
<v Speaker 5>you're on a canoe,</v>

760
00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:50.680
<v Speaker 5>you don't know did and did you have to talk her into this?</v>

761
00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:51.840
<v Speaker 4>Nah,</v>

762
00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:52.660
<v Speaker 4>she was into it.</v>

763
00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:53.493
<v Speaker 4>She was fired up.</v>

764
00:19:53.670 --> 00:19:54.940
<v Speaker 4>So I think she was looking for,</v>

765
00:19:54.970 --> 00:19:57.690
<v Speaker 4>she doesn't really have any strong kind of set beliefs,</v>

766
00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.820
<v Speaker 4>but she's like a look of rabid explorer.</v>

767
00:19:59.821 --> 00:20:02.160
<v Speaker 4>She loves new adventures and things like that.</v>

768
00:20:02.161 --> 00:20:03.960
<v Speaker 4>So she knew I was into it and she's like,</v>

769
00:20:03.961 --> 00:20:04.201
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

770
00:20:04.201 --> 00:20:05.000
<v Speaker 4>I'd love to do that.</v>

771
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.020
<v Speaker 4>So was she ever religious at all?</v>

772
00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:07.740
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

773
00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:09.510
<v Speaker 4>not really now.</v>

774
00:20:09.511 --> 00:20:09.931
<v Speaker 4>But she's,</v>

775
00:20:09.931 --> 00:20:10.201
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

776
00:20:10.201 --> 00:20:11.400
<v Speaker 4>she's just open to things,</v>

777
00:20:11.401 --> 00:20:11.781
<v Speaker 4>but she has,</v>

778
00:20:11.781 --> 00:20:14.490
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't really formed her own paradigm necessarily.</v>

779
00:20:14.491 --> 00:20:17.730
<v Speaker 4>She knows enough to discard the bullshit monotheistic paradigm.</v>

780
00:20:17.731 --> 00:20:18.000
<v Speaker 4>She's like,</v>

781
00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:18.240
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

782
00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:18.960
<v Speaker 4>that's not true.</v>

783
00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.580
<v Speaker 4>But she hasn't really gone the other way to say like,</v>

784
00:20:21.630 --> 00:20:21.930
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

785
00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:23.670
<v Speaker 4>what else can I construct now?</v>

786
00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.710
<v Speaker 4>Before she did this Iowasca trip,</v>

787
00:20:25.711 --> 00:20:27.630
<v Speaker 4>did she have any psychedelic experiences,</v>

788
00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.720
<v Speaker 4>like a bad acid trip back in college or something like that.</v>

789
00:20:30.721 --> 00:20:34.620
<v Speaker 4>So pretty much did you talk or any of this or a little bit?</v>

790
00:20:34.830 --> 00:20:35.221
<v Speaker 4>A little bit.</v>

791
00:20:35.221 --> 00:20:35.581
<v Speaker 4>She was,</v>

792
00:20:35.581 --> 00:20:37.980
<v Speaker 4>she was a bit nervous about that aspect of old your mom.</v>

793
00:20:38.130 --> 00:20:38.610
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

794
00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:40.770
<v Speaker 4>60 ish,</v>

795
00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:41.940
<v Speaker 4>I should probably say</v>

796
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:44.310
<v Speaker 4>crazy,</v>

797
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:45.130
<v Speaker 4>but she was a,</v>

798
00:20:45.130 --> 00:20:45.391
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

799
00:20:45.391 --> 00:20:49.060
<v Speaker 4>they do a really good job when you get down explaining every one of the Shamans</v>

800
00:20:49.061 --> 00:20:49.690
<v Speaker 4>we met,</v>

801
00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:51.520
<v Speaker 4>I'm kinda jumping ahead in the story a bit,</v>

802
00:20:51.521 --> 00:20:54.130
<v Speaker 4>but explaining how it's 100% medicine.</v>

803
00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.070
<v Speaker 4>Like all of them,</v>

804
00:20:55.071 --> 00:20:55.331
<v Speaker 4>they're like,</v>

805
00:20:55.331 --> 00:20:56.350
<v Speaker 4>this is medicine.</v>

806
00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:57.610
<v Speaker 4>You don't do this for fun.</v>

807
00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.110
<v Speaker 4>You do this to cleanse your body,</v>

808
00:20:59.111 --> 00:21:00.100
<v Speaker 4>to cleanse your organs.</v>

809
00:21:00.101 --> 00:21:02.530
<v Speaker 4>You purge it and it shows you things you know,</v>

810
00:21:02.531 --> 00:21:03.490
<v Speaker 4>and there's a wisdom to it.</v>

811
00:21:03.491 --> 00:21:06.790
<v Speaker 4>It's a hundred percent medicine and they get really offended when you call it a</v>

812
00:21:06.791 --> 00:21:07.390
<v Speaker 4>drug,</v>

813
00:21:07.390 --> 00:21:07.601
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

814
00:21:07.601 --> 00:21:08.401
<v Speaker 4>to them it's a medicine.</v>

815
00:21:08.401 --> 00:21:09.430
<v Speaker 4>It's the master medicine.</v>

816
00:21:09.670 --> 00:21:10.151
<v Speaker 4>Like you said,</v>

817
00:21:10.151 --> 00:21:14.290
<v Speaker 4>it's the medicine that they believe has helped them find all other medicines in</v>

818
00:21:14.291 --> 00:21:15.070
<v Speaker 4>the jungle.</v>

819
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:15.311
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

820
00:21:15.311 --> 00:21:16.390
<v Speaker 4>they take the IOWASCA,</v>

821
00:21:16.391 --> 00:21:19.510
<v Speaker 4>they go in and that's how they find their other cures and all of these</v>

822
00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:19.931
<v Speaker 4>showman's,</v>

823
00:21:19.931 --> 00:21:22.930
<v Speaker 4>these veggie least as I WASC is just one part of it.</v>

824
00:21:22.931 --> 00:21:24.040
<v Speaker 4>But it's to them,</v>

825
00:21:24.041 --> 00:21:25.810
<v Speaker 4>that's their master sacred medicine.</v>

826
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:26.270
<v Speaker 4>So</v>

827
00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:27.570
<v Speaker 5>I lost her so bad ass.</v>

828
00:21:27.571 --> 00:21:29.180
<v Speaker 5>So they don't give a fuck about mushrooms.</v>

829
00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:30.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

830
00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:32.860
<v Speaker 5>Schamens likes playing with that shit for sure.</v>

831
00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:33.860
<v Speaker 5>We playing with that shit for it.</v>

832
00:21:33.861 --> 00:21:33.981
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

833
00:21:33.981 --> 00:21:37.790
<v Speaker 5>You're going to see some crazy ass take symbols and you don't need put that down</v>

834
00:21:37.791 --> 00:21:38.571
<v Speaker 5>and have a drink of this.</v>

835
00:21:38.571 --> 00:21:39.404
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

836
00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:40.790
<v Speaker 5>But you know what they do say?</v>

837
00:21:40.791 --> 00:21:41.570
<v Speaker 5>They say,</v>

838
00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:44.720
<v Speaker 5>you know you can't always get Iowasca so they recommend that mushroom is when</v>

839
00:21:44.721 --> 00:21:45.091
<v Speaker 5>you can,</v>

840
00:21:45.091 --> 00:21:48.530
<v Speaker 5>I have every every two months they're like every two months you better do</v>

841
00:21:48.531 --> 00:21:49.760
<v Speaker 5>something and if you've got mushrooms,</v>

842
00:21:49.761 --> 00:21:50.594
<v Speaker 5>great</v>

843
00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:53.810
<v Speaker 5>every two months you should be setting.</v>

844
00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:56.320
<v Speaker 5>That's a good segue because they say you need to hit that reset button,</v>

845
00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.010
<v Speaker 5>reconnect with the earth mother.</v>

846
00:21:58.011 --> 00:21:59.130
<v Speaker 5>And you know that kind of,</v>

847
00:21:59.270 --> 00:22:02.120
<v Speaker 5>which of them is just a representation of the the Yin side,</v>

848
00:22:02.121 --> 00:22:03.710
<v Speaker 5>that kind of every two months,</v>

849
00:22:03.711 --> 00:22:04.860
<v Speaker 5>nature side of the house.</v>

850
00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:08.570
<v Speaker 5>I've had some DMT experiences that were so intense.</v>

851
00:22:08.571 --> 00:22:09.590
<v Speaker 5>I took years off.</v>

852
00:22:10.610 --> 00:22:11.250
<v Speaker 5>I was just like,</v>

853
00:22:11.250 --> 00:22:11.540
<v Speaker 5>Whoa,</v>

854
00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:12.920
<v Speaker 5>I need to think about this.</v>

855
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:14.060
<v Speaker 5>But DMT,</v>

856
00:22:14.061 --> 00:22:19.061
<v Speaker 5>the orally active version is much slower and more gradual and you can kind of</v>

857
00:22:19.551 --> 00:22:21.440
<v Speaker 5>tune in and out of it.</v>

858
00:22:21.441 --> 00:22:26.000
<v Speaker 5>You can get in the meditative state when it's full blown or as it's slipping</v>

859
00:22:26.001 --> 00:22:26.331
<v Speaker 5>away,</v>

860
00:22:26.331 --> 00:22:29.390
<v Speaker 5>you can get right back in there if you relax and tune into it.</v>

861
00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:30.663
<v Speaker 5>If you're a warrior,</v>

862
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.851
<v Speaker 5>if you're a warrior.</v>

863
00:22:31.851 --> 00:22:32.600
<v Speaker 5>But if it's crap,</v>

864
00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:33.380
<v Speaker 5>if you're a career,</v>

865
00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:34.131
<v Speaker 5>if you're cracked,</v>

866
00:22:34.131 --> 00:22:36.160
<v Speaker 5>it's gonna fucking destroy you was,</v>

867
00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:37.130
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

868
00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:38.360
<v Speaker 5>I'll get into that in the story.</v>

869
00:22:38.361 --> 00:22:40.370
<v Speaker 5>But you have to know who you are.</v>

870
00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:42.580
<v Speaker 5>You do before you start fucking with this stuff.</v>

871
00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:43.101
<v Speaker 5>It's happy.</v>

872
00:22:43.101 --> 00:22:44.360
<v Speaker 5>They call it the vine of death.</v>

873
00:22:44.590 --> 00:22:44.840
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

874
00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.250
<v Speaker 5>that's the sign of the souls,</v>

875
00:22:46.251 --> 00:22:46.460
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

916
00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:30.710
<v Speaker 5>Oh Wow.</v>

917
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:33.280
<v Speaker 5>Wade and me and him were the most different out of it.</v>

918
00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.730
<v Speaker 5>Everybody else in the whole group,</v>

919
00:23:34.731 --> 00:23:36.110
<v Speaker 5>everybody else was definitely,</v>

920
00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:37.190
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

921
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.580
<v Speaker 5>not,</v>

922
00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:37.761
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

923
00:23:37.761 --> 00:23:38.241
<v Speaker 5>as I said,</v>

924
00:23:38.241 --> 00:23:40.180
<v Speaker 5>not the saltiest bunch you've got to bring out.</v>

925
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:40.610
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

926
00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:41.001
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

927
00:23:41.001 --> 00:23:41.531
<v Speaker 5>So Do,</v>

928
00:23:41.531 --> 00:23:45.860
<v Speaker 5>do they slowly let you dip your feet in the barn as you in and uh,</v>

929
00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:46.070
<v Speaker 5>and</v>

930
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:47.240
<v Speaker 4>they announced the three Shamans,</v>

931
00:23:47.241 --> 00:23:50.600
<v Speaker 4>they flown in the three best schamens improve basically,</v>

932
00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:50.960
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

933
00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:51.830
<v Speaker 4>from different camps,</v>

934
00:23:51.831 --> 00:23:52.820
<v Speaker 4>different parts of the jungle.</v>

935
00:23:52.821 --> 00:23:54.500
<v Speaker 4>One is local to where they're at.</v>

936
00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:57.050
<v Speaker 4>So it's like a battle of the DJ's this exactly.</v>

937
00:23:57.051 --> 00:23:58.460
<v Speaker 4>And you choose which one you want to work with.</v>

938
00:23:58.461 --> 00:24:02.610
<v Speaker 4>So they announced the first one a long lineage of what he's done and he kind of</v>

939
00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:05.900
<v Speaker 4>integrate some of the Christian saints with some of the Iowasca work,</v>

940
00:24:05.901 --> 00:24:09.920
<v Speaker 4>works with the masculine aspects as a big bio of all he's accomplished.</v>

941
00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:10.551
<v Speaker 4>So it's like,</v>

942
00:24:10.551 --> 00:24:10.851
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

943
00:24:10.851 --> 00:24:11.151
<v Speaker 4>whatever,</v>

944
00:24:11.151 --> 00:24:12.890
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not really going to be into the,</v>

945
00:24:12.891 --> 00:24:13.131
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

946
00:24:13.131 --> 00:24:14.720
<v Speaker 4>kind of mixing of the Christian ideal.</v>

947
00:24:14.721 --> 00:24:16.190
<v Speaker 4>So wait for the second guy,</v>

948
00:24:16.191 --> 00:24:20.930
<v Speaker 4>he has his own psychology clinic and then in the jungle and he's helped build</v>

949
00:24:20.931 --> 00:24:21.890
<v Speaker 4>this hospital and blah,</v>

950
00:24:21.891 --> 00:24:22.011
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

951
00:24:22.011 --> 00:24:22.161
<v Speaker 4>blah,</v>

952
00:24:22.161 --> 00:24:23.600
<v Speaker 4>another big long thing.</v>

953
00:24:23.601 --> 00:24:25.970
<v Speaker 4>And he sings he sweet songs and then they get to the third guy.</v>

954
00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:26.781
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

955
00:24:26.781 --> 00:24:27.000
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

956
00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:27.741
<v Speaker 4>the third guy,</v>

957
00:24:27.741 --> 00:24:31.520
<v Speaker 4>they say only say he's the most traditional and the most terrifying.</v>

958
00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:33.800
<v Speaker 4>He calls upon the spirit of the dragon and that's it.</v>

959
00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:34.641
<v Speaker 4>That's all I said.</v>

960
00:24:34.641 --> 00:24:35.360
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

961
00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:36.160

962
00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:36.993
<v Speaker 4>my guy,</v>

963
00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.080
<v Speaker 4>that's all he said about him.</v>

964
00:24:39.081 --> 00:24:41.330
<v Speaker 4>That's all I said about less is more people.</v>

965
00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:43.970
<v Speaker 4>It's a Clint Eastwood approach to shamanism.</v>

966
00:24:43.971 --> 00:24:44.510
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

967
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:45.021
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

968
00:24:45.021 --> 00:24:45.854
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

969
00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:46.311
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

970
00:24:46.311 --> 00:24:46.881

<v Speaker 4>they won't pull up in a canoe.</v>

978
00:24:53.631 --> 00:24:55.000
<v Speaker 4>What time do you actually get to the campus?</v>

981
00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:58.530
<v Speaker 4>Do you eat first or no,</v>

982
00:24:58.531 --> 00:24:58.940
<v Speaker 4>eat.</v>

983
00:24:58.940 --> 00:24:59.420

00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:51.080
<v Speaker 4>so he didn't mind.</v>

1024
00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:51.381
<v Speaker 4>They don't,</v>

1025
00:25:51.381 --> 00:25:53.780
<v Speaker 4>you don't get to watch them now they have to boil it,</v>

1026
00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:54.741
<v Speaker 4>boil one,</v>

1027
00:25:54.741 --> 00:25:55.491
<v Speaker 4>boil the other,</v>

1028
00:25:55.491 --> 00:25:56.010
<v Speaker 4>mix it.</v>

1029
00:25:56.010 --> 00:26:00.020
<v Speaker 4>But it was my has their own secret perfect recipe that they've learned from</v>

1030
00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:00.710
<v Speaker 4>Taiwan.</v>

1031
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:03.860
<v Speaker 4>I would want to see them cook it because after the movie altered states,</v>

1032
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:05.390
<v Speaker 4>that was one of the trippiest parts.</v>

1033
00:26:05.391 --> 00:26:06.560
<v Speaker 4>When the guy was cooking up to shit,</v>

1034
00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:07.371
<v Speaker 4>I want to see them cook it.</v>

1035
00:26:07.371 --> 00:26:10.400
<v Speaker 4>Like you can't just pull it out of a fucking Tupperware container for me,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I want to see it cook it.</v>

1038
00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:12.111
<v Speaker 4>I actually,</v>

1039
00:26:12.111 --> 00:26:16.500
<v Speaker 4>there's a video I posted on my blog kind of midway down on a warrior poet.us</v>

1040
00:26:16.550 --> 00:26:19.670
<v Speaker 4>that has actually the meister that I work with and it shows some pictures of</v>

1041
00:26:19.671 --> 00:26:21.710
<v Speaker 4>them boiling it with the big sticks.</v>

1042
00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:26.660
<v Speaker 4>And it has like a big cast iron pots to put up two different pots brewing side</v>

1043
00:26:26.661 --> 00:26:27.830
<v Speaker 4>by side one with the leaf,</v>

1044
00:26:27.831 --> 00:26:28.790
<v Speaker 4>I think in one with a,</v>

1045
00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:29.420
<v Speaker 4>with a vice,</v>

1046
00:26:29.420 --> 00:26:30.560
<v Speaker 4>a long ass time,</v>

1047
00:26:30.561 --> 00:26:30.830
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

00:26:31.130 --> 00:26:31.641
<v Speaker 4>It's not quite,</v>

1050
00:26:31.641 --> 00:26:33.260
<v Speaker 4>it takes like 10 hours or something to make.</v>

1051
00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:34.370
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1052
00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:34.791
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1053
00:26:34.791 --> 00:26:35.180
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1054
00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:37.820
<v Speaker 4>they sit you down and how do they determine the dosage?</v>

1055
00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:38.601
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1056
00:26:38.601 --> 00:26:38.851
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1057
00:26:38.851 --> 00:26:40.720
<v Speaker 4>it's an eyeball test from the shotgun.</v>

1058
00:26:40.730 --> 00:26:41.780
<v Speaker 4>So we walk in,</v>

1059
00:26:41.781 --> 00:26:41.950
<v Speaker 4>we,</v>

1060
00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:42.470
<v Speaker 4>I have,</v>

1061
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:45.450
<v Speaker 4>I have by the fewest people with our group because people were scared of the</v>

1062
00:26:45.451 --> 00:26:46.860
<v Speaker 4>dragon and it denying,</v>

1063
00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.630
<v Speaker 4>so I had like 10 people,</v>

1064
00:26:48.631 --> 00:26:51.300
<v Speaker 4>so we don't have a small hut and the secluded part of the jungle.</v>

1065
00:26:51.301 --> 00:26:53.190
<v Speaker 4>So along walk my,</v>

1066
00:26:53.191 --> 00:26:53.520
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1067
00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:57.000
<v Speaker 4>my fearless compatriots were kind of laughing and joking around and I felt</v>

1068
00:26:57.001 --> 00:26:57.421
<v Speaker 4>confident,</v>

1069
00:26:57.421 --> 00:26:58.650
<v Speaker 4>but I was very calm.</v>

1070
00:26:58.651 --> 00:27:01.170
<v Speaker 4>I knew I was going into some pretty intense work,</v>

1071
00:27:01.171 --> 00:27:01.411
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1072
00:27:01.411 --> 00:27:02.130
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

1073
00:27:02.130 --> 00:27:02.640
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1074
00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:03.240
<v Speaker 4>we had it,</v>

1075
00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.350
<v Speaker 4>we get in there and then,</v>

1076
00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:04.591
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1077

<v Speaker 6>k.</v>

1079
00:27:09.770 --> 00:27:10.603
<v Speaker 6>Dot.</v>

1080
00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:14.900
<v Speaker 6>So all of us are faced like spokes of a wheel towards the center of the room</v>

1081
00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.620
<v Speaker 4>and we all have a puke bucket kind of near us because,</v>

1082
00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:17.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1083

<v Speaker 4>most people purge during this process.</v>

1084
00:27:20.381 --> 00:27:21.700
<v Speaker 4>It's part of the healing process.</v>

1085
00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:22.691
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

1086
00:27:22.691 --> 00:27:23.320
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1087

00:28:59.491 --> 00:29:01.990
<v Speaker 1>Get one of those and we'll play it on the background while he's talking to,</v>

1169
00:29:02.350 --> 00:29:03.570
<v Speaker 1>it'll be trippy as fuck.</v>

1170
00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:09.620
<v Speaker 1>So this cat has his own separate eco roast and the other two gentlemen have</v>

1171
00:29:09.961 --> 00:29:10.770
<v Speaker 1>their own,</v>

1172
00:29:10.770 --> 00:29:12.300
<v Speaker 1>and they have female Shamans as well,</v>

1173
00:29:12.301 --> 00:29:12.620
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1174
00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:13.453
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1175
00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:14.951
<v Speaker 4>Not here.</v>

1176
00:29:14.951 --> 00:29:15.371
<v Speaker 4>They do,</v>

1177
00:29:15.371 --> 00:29:17.950
<v Speaker 4>but not the IOWASCA arrows in the vegetal east does.</v>

1178
00:29:17.951 --> 00:29:18.190
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1179
00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:20.290
<v Speaker 4>it's kind of a very paternalistic,</v>

1180
00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:21.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1181
00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:21.251
<v Speaker 4>could,</v>

1182
00:29:21.251 --> 00:29:22.020
<v Speaker 4>it's not a heritage,</v>

1183
00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:22.811
<v Speaker 4>a male dominated.</v>

1184
00:29:22.811 --> 00:29:24.680
<v Speaker 4>It's not about like priests,</v>

1185
00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:25.210
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1186
00:29:25.210 --> 00:29:25.650
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1187
00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:26.280
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1188
00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:26.410
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1189
00:29:26.410 --> 00:29:26.740
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1190
00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:27.281
<v Speaker 4>it's very,</v>

1191
00:29:27.281 --> 00:29:27.640
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1192
00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.980
<v Speaker 4>they worship higher than anything is the earth mother.</v>

1193
00:29:30.010 --> 00:29:32.410
<v Speaker 4>So it just happens to seem that the men,</v>

1194
00:29:32.650 --> 00:29:33.130
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1195
00:29:33.130 --> 00:29:34.330
<v Speaker 4>where the maestros in this case,</v>

1196
00:29:34.331 --> 00:29:36.280
<v Speaker 4>there's female Shamans for sure.</v>

1197
00:29:36.310 --> 00:29:37.480
<v Speaker 4>They call them don't onions.</v>

1198
00:29:37.930 --> 00:29:38.870
<v Speaker 4>My ester us.</v>

1199
00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:39.440
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1200
00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.070
<v Speaker 4>and we,</v>

1201
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.930
<v Speaker 4>I was actually one in the,</v>

1202
00:29:41.570 --> 00:29:41.740
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1203
00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:44.050
<v Speaker 4>but she wasn't an Ios Garrow necessarily.</v>

1204
00:29:44.051 --> 00:29:46.720
<v Speaker 4>She was just a more General Sharman.</v>

1205
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:47.500
<v Speaker 4>But she was,</v>

1206
00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:48.370
<v Speaker 4>she was smart too,</v>

1207
00:29:48.371 --> 00:29:49.204
<v Speaker 4>and she was strong.</v>

1208
00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:49.950
<v Speaker 4>You got something to,</v>

1209
00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:50.230

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:52.133
<v Speaker 7>Would that be it?</v>

1212
00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:54.651
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

1213
00:29:54.651 --> 00:29:55.484
<v Speaker 5>let's hear it.</v>

1214
00:29:57.210 --> 00:29:59.040
<v Speaker 4>It's too many instruments in there obviously,</v>

1215
00:29:59.041 --> 00:30:01.530
<v Speaker 4>but they use just like a whistle in their voice.</v>

1216
00:30:01.531 --> 00:30:02.364
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

1217

1252
00:30:57.900 --> 00:30:58.980
<v Speaker 4>my guy didn't sound like that.</v>

1253
00:30:58.981 --> 00:31:00.420
<v Speaker 4>He was a lot more basketball.</v>

1254
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:01.303
<v Speaker 4>Fine Buck.</v>

1255
00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:02.323
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1256
00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:02.601
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1257
00:31:02.601 --> 00:31:03.434
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>

1258
00:31:03.690 --> 00:31:04.090
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1259
00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:05.180
<v Speaker 4>So he only has,</v>

1260
00:31:05.181 --> 00:31:05.961
<v Speaker 4>his tools are,</v>

1261
00:31:05.961 --> 00:31:07.220
<v Speaker 4>he has his breath,</v>

1262
00:31:07.221 --> 00:31:08.450
<v Speaker 4>but you use this more than anything.</v>

1263
00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:10.130
<v Speaker 4>And then he has a,</v>

1264
00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:14.840
<v Speaker 4>he has a kind of a branch with a bunch of leaves that he uses this sort of like</v>

1265
00:31:14.841 --> 00:31:18.250
<v Speaker 4>a rattle and those are his tools in his voice and his listening.</v>

1266
00:31:18.730 --> 00:31:19.220
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1267
00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:20.810
<v Speaker 4>and he also has some cinnamon sticks,</v>

1268
00:31:20.811 --> 00:31:21.740
<v Speaker 4>which you choose at the end.</v>

1269
00:31:21.741 --> 00:31:22.490
<v Speaker 4>But I'll get,</v>

1270
00:31:22.490 --> 00:31:23.323
<v Speaker 4>I'll get to that.</v>

1271
00:31:24.170 --> 00:31:25.100
<v Speaker 4>This is tripping me out.</v>

1272
00:31:25.460 --> 00:31:26.360
<v Speaker 4>Put me back in</v>

1273
00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.140
<v Speaker 4>back there.</v>

1274
00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:31.970
<v Speaker 4>You're going to change your name back to Chris.</v>

1275
00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:34.941
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1276
00:31:34.941 --> 00:31:37.310
<v Speaker 4>So how long does it take after you drink it?</v>

1277
00:31:37.350 --> 00:31:38.540
<v Speaker 4>About 45 minutes.</v>

1278
00:31:38.541 --> 00:31:40.940
<v Speaker 4>You start to feel people rustling 30 to 45 minutes.</v>

1279
00:31:40.941 --> 00:31:41.301
<v Speaker 4>It's hard.</v>

1280
00:31:41.301 --> 00:31:42.320
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's cave dark.</v>

1281
00:31:42.321 --> 00:31:44.180
<v Speaker 4>You don't have a perfect perception of time,</v>

1282
00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:45.860
<v Speaker 4>but 30 to 45 minutes,</v>

1283
00:31:45.861 --> 00:31:46.760
<v Speaker 4>people start to rustle.</v>

1284
00:31:46.761 --> 00:31:47.780
<v Speaker 4>It starts to activate.</v>

1285
00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:48.970
<v Speaker 4>How big is this came this,</v>

1286
00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:49.690
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1287
00:31:49.690 --> 00:31:50.240
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1288
00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:52.100
<v Speaker 4>probably 20 foot in diameter.</v>

1289
00:31:52.370 --> 00:31:53.090
<v Speaker 4>So it's tight,</v>

1290
00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:54.320
<v Speaker 4>tight quarters for 10 people.</v>

1291
00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:56.920
<v Speaker 4>So it starts going and you know,</v>

1292
00:31:56.950 --> 00:31:59.060
<v Speaker 4>you start to get that energetic activation,</v>

1293
00:31:59.061 --> 00:32:02.390
<v Speaker 4>same as you do on mushrooms or something where you know something's about to</v>

1294
00:32:02.391 --> 00:32:02.781
<v Speaker 4>happen,</v>

1295
00:32:02.781 --> 00:32:03.271
<v Speaker 4>you're closed.</v>

1296
00:32:03.271 --> 00:32:07.220
<v Speaker 4>I had visuals start to splash with color and light and things like that.</v>

1297
00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:07.760
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1298
00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:10.520
<v Speaker 4>your stomach starts to Gurgle a little bit and then uh,</v>

1299
00:32:10.521 --> 00:32:12.590
<v Speaker 4>so that was happening and he started as he cross,</v>

1300
00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:12.831
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1301
00:32:12.831 --> 00:32:13.850
<v Speaker 4>starts slowly,</v>

1302
00:32:13.910 --> 00:32:16.760
<v Speaker 4>kind of like it is now whistling and building,</v>

1303
00:32:16.761 --> 00:32:17.480
<v Speaker 4>building.</v>

1304
00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:18.110
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

1305
00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:18.381
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1306
00:32:18.381 --> 00:32:19.490
<v Speaker 4>at about an hour you here,</v>

1307
00:32:19.491 --> 00:32:23.360
<v Speaker 4>the first person just Rach like Ahhh.</v>

1308
00:32:23.420 --> 00:32:26.070
<v Speaker 4>And it's not like just a gentle bullying style.</v>

1309
00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:31.720
<v Speaker 4>This is like years of rock just pouring out of every organ that they have and</v>

1310
00:32:31.911 --> 00:32:32.110
<v Speaker 4>their,</v>

1311
00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:33.650
<v Speaker 4>it's their half yelling,</v>

1312
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:35.090
<v Speaker 4>half puking when they do it.</v>

1313
00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:36.020
<v Speaker 4>I mean he's like,</v>

1314
00:32:36.020 --> 00:32:36.853
<v Speaker 4>ah.</v>

1315
00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:38.960
<v Speaker 4>So it's not just the,</v>

1316
00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:40.640
<v Speaker 4>the medicine coming up.</v>

1317
00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:41.810
<v Speaker 4>There's like a,</v>

1318
00:32:41.930 --> 00:32:42.763
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1319
00:32:42.890 --> 00:32:47.630
<v Speaker 4>like a sacrifice or expelling mio and things out of your,</v>

1320
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:48.583
<v Speaker 4>out of your organs.</v>

1321
00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:51.590
<v Speaker 4>I didn't Puke till the second paradigm shifting session,</v>

1322
00:32:51.591 --> 00:32:53.870
<v Speaker 4>but you either goes out your,</v>

1323
00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:54.260
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1324
00:32:54.260 --> 00:32:56.990
<v Speaker 4>you vomit or finds another motive evacuation.</v>

1325
00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:58.100
<v Speaker 4>But it's,</v>

1326
00:32:58.100 --> 00:32:59.120
<v Speaker 4>you can feel it works.</v>

1327
00:32:59.121 --> 00:33:00.470
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people shit themselves too.</v>

1328
00:33:00.471 --> 00:33:01.304
<v Speaker 4>Is that what you're saying?</v>

1329
00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:02.930
<v Speaker 4>It wouldn't be,</v>

1330
00:33:02.931 --> 00:33:03.410
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1331
00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:05.020
<v Speaker 4>it has the Tanner,</v>

1332
00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:06.150
<v Speaker 4>they just shit themselves at all.</v>

1333
00:33:06.151 --> 00:33:08.180
<v Speaker 4>And I'll explain all play Israeli guy.</v>

1334
00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:09.350
<v Speaker 4>He was in a,</v>

1335
00:33:09.350 --> 00:33:11.090
<v Speaker 4>he was in a different session actually that time,</v>

1336
00:33:11.091 --> 00:33:11.924
<v Speaker 4>so I wasn't there.</v>

1337
00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:12.571
<v Speaker 4>But anyway,</v>

1338
00:33:12.571 --> 00:33:17.150
<v Speaker 4>so the first people start to purge and then pretty soon after that you smell</v>

1339
00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:17.780
<v Speaker 4>farts.</v>

1340
00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:18.310
<v Speaker 4>It was,</v>

1341
00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:19.070
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1342
00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:21.290
<v Speaker 4>it was just chaos erupts in the room.</v>

1343
00:33:21.450 --> 00:33:22.620
<v Speaker 4>We all Michael Pants,</v>

1344
00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:23.350
<v Speaker 4>like one of the,</v>

1345
00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:26.000
<v Speaker 4>one of the ladies just turn into a blithering child.</v>

1346
00:33:26.001 --> 00:33:26.181
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>

1347
00:33:26.181 --> 00:33:26.721
<v Speaker 4>help me,</v>

1348
00:33:26.721 --> 00:33:27.171
<v Speaker 4>help me,</v>

1349
00:33:27.171 --> 00:33:27.651
<v Speaker 4>help me.</v>

1350
00:33:27.651 --> 00:33:30.870
<v Speaker 4>But another person started pretending that he could sing the gross,</v>

1351
00:33:30.890 --> 00:33:33.200
<v Speaker 4>but it was like a kid that thinks he knows the words to a song.</v>

1352
00:33:33.800 --> 00:33:36.080
<v Speaker 4>She was like two beats off and it was awful.</v>

1353
00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:39.590
<v Speaker 4>And then another lady completely lost her internal monologue.</v>

1354
00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:42.740
<v Speaker 4>And this culminated throughout the night and her finally saying,</v>

1355
00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:47.840
<v Speaker 4>I can't tell if I shit my pants or if I didn't shit my pants like over and over</v>

1356
00:33:47.841 --> 00:33:48.201
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

1357
00:33:48.201 --> 00:33:48.740
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

1358
00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:49.820
<v Speaker 4>Oh God,</v>

1359
00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:50.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1360
00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:50.751
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1361
00:33:50.751 --> 00:33:52.220
<v Speaker 4>this is so people,</v>

1362
00:33:52.221 --> 00:33:52.730
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1363
00:33:52.730 --> 00:33:54.500
<v Speaker 4>people who weren't ready cracked,</v>

1364
00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:54.951
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1365
00:33:54.951 --> 00:33:55.340
<v Speaker 4>bad.</v>

1366
00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:56.031
<v Speaker 4>I mean it wasn't,</v>

1367
00:33:56.031 --> 00:33:57.560
<v Speaker 4>that's not the experience you're supposed to get.</v>

1368
00:33:57.561 --> 00:33:59.030
<v Speaker 4>You're supposed to keep it to yourself,</v>

1369
00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:01.680
<v Speaker 4>follow through to interfere with your thoughts though on homeless.</v>

1370
00:34:01.681 --> 00:34:03.790
<v Speaker 4>Throw you off that a little bit freaking out.</v>

1371
00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:04.340
<v Speaker 4>But it was,</v>

1372
00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:05.120
<v Speaker 4>it was two pounds.</v>

1373
00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:07.550
<v Speaker 4>And knowing that part,</v>

1374
00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:09.200
<v Speaker 4>that part was rough in this first,</v>

1375
00:34:09.260 --> 00:34:10.100
<v Speaker 4>in this first session.</v>

1376
00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:10.940
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

1377
00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:11.181
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1378
00:34:11.181 --> 00:34:12.650
<v Speaker 4>right as I'm starting to get,</v>

1379
00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:12.921
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1380
00:34:12.921 --> 00:34:14.210
<v Speaker 4>get some serious visions.</v>

1381
00:34:14.390 --> 00:34:19.250
<v Speaker 4>Lady next to me and I'd like shuttered and she puked all over my socks.</v>

1382
00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:24.820
<v Speaker 4>So they pitch black and I'm peeling off the wet chunky wool from my feet and put</v>

1383
00:34:24.831 --> 00:34:26.780
<v Speaker 4>him on the side and just curl back up on my map.</v>

1384
00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:27.860
<v Speaker 4>No way to clean it.</v>

1385
00:34:27.910 --> 00:34:30.620
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking pitch black or in the middle of the ceremony starting to trip</v>

1386
00:34:30.621 --> 00:34:31.454
<v Speaker 4>balls.</v>

1387
00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:32.390
<v Speaker 4>So that was,</v>

1388
00:34:32.391 --> 00:34:33.500
<v Speaker 4>that was the start of it.</v>

1389
00:34:33.710 --> 00:34:34.130
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1390
00:34:34.130 --> 00:34:37.610
<v Speaker 4>and it was kind of signatory for the way the rest of the night went because it</v>

1391
00:34:37.611 --> 00:34:39.770
<v Speaker 4>was intense and dark.</v>

1392
00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:40.663
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1393
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:41.833
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1394
00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:45.910
<v Speaker 4>what started happening is snake started coming in through the jungle.</v>

1395
00:34:45.911 --> 00:34:49.400
<v Speaker 4>I had visions of snakes and they would look at me and then immediately start</v>

1396
00:34:49.401 --> 00:34:53.030
<v Speaker 4>savagely like going inside my body and like eating my organs,</v>

1397
00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:54.260
<v Speaker 4>eating my throat,</v>

1398
00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:58.040
<v Speaker 4>like going down my throat and eating their way out and like exploding through my</v>

1399
00:34:58.041 --> 00:34:58.850
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>

1400
00:34:58.850 --> 00:35:02.810
<v Speaker 4>And I know enough from psychedelic experiences to just witness and allow and</v>

1401
00:35:02.811 --> 00:35:03.680
<v Speaker 4>just let it happen.</v>

1402
00:35:03.681 --> 00:35:03.831
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1403
00:35:03.831 --> 00:35:04.880
<v Speaker 4>Cause if you try and fight it,</v>

1404
00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:05.540
<v Speaker 4>you're fucked.</v>

1405
00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:06.170
<v Speaker 4>You're fucked.</v>

1406
00:35:06.170 --> 00:35:06.860
<v Speaker 4>You can't,</v>

1407
00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:10.490
<v Speaker 4>that is the number one reason why people have bad trips.</v>

1408
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:10.790
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1409
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:12.380
<v Speaker 4>They tried to control the experience.</v>

1410
00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:15.560
<v Speaker 4>But did you think these snakes were real or did you know they were kind of like,</v>

1411
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:19.140
<v Speaker 4>I was cool with this at this point and then it switched.</v>

1412
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:20.743
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1413
00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:21.290
<v Speaker 4>Cool.</v>

1414
00:35:21.290 --> 00:35:22.160
<v Speaker 4>Just think blasting.</v>

1415
00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:25.070
<v Speaker 4>I kind of knew that the vine and death was going to take me there.</v>

1416
00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:27.310
<v Speaker 4>I had a feeling that these snakes,</v>

1417
00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:31.130
<v Speaker 4>do they look like real snakes or do you know that's a fucking real snake?</v>

1418
00:35:31.131 --> 00:35:33.080
<v Speaker 4>I'm actually getting eaten by a jungle snake right now.</v>

1419
00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:33.381
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1420
00:35:33.381 --> 00:35:34.310
<v Speaker 4>they were more like,</v>

1421
00:35:34.311 --> 00:35:35.050
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1422
00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:36.230
<v Speaker 4>there were a bit a femur or you know,</v>

1423
00:35:36.231 --> 00:35:39.540
<v Speaker 4>they would change too much in color and the way that they would come was not</v>

1424
00:35:39.930 --> 00:35:41.730
<v Speaker 4>necessarily slithering on the ground.</v>

1425
00:35:41.731 --> 00:35:45.180
<v Speaker 4>They were coming from the air and they all top hats on snakes.</v>

1426
00:35:45.181 --> 00:35:45.421
<v Speaker 4>Lou,</v>

1427
00:35:45.421 --> 00:35:46.800
<v Speaker 4>they look like a lot of them,</v>

1428
00:35:46.801 --> 00:35:47.634
<v Speaker 4>a lot of them were,</v>

1429
00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:48.510
<v Speaker 4>were kind of white.</v>

1430
00:35:48.511 --> 00:35:48.751
<v Speaker 4>They were,</v>

1431
00:35:48.751 --> 00:35:51.930
<v Speaker 4>they looked actually the more like boas or con or like anacondas not,</v>

1432
00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.780
<v Speaker 4>not as much like domestic snakes that we'd find out here,</v>

1433
00:35:54.781 --> 00:35:56.430
<v Speaker 4>but they had that kind of jungle pattern.</v>

1434
00:35:56.431 --> 00:35:57.264
<v Speaker 4>But they would,</v>

1435
00:35:57.370 --> 00:35:57.900
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1436
00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:58.770
<v Speaker 4>the colors were off.</v>

1437
00:35:58.800 --> 00:35:59.311
<v Speaker 4>They were not,</v>

1438
00:35:59.311 --> 00:36:00.980
<v Speaker 4>they were either too colorful or they're,</v>

1439
00:36:01.090 --> 00:36:02.010
<v Speaker 4>or they're white.</v>

1440
00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:03.630
<v Speaker 4>They weren't like jungle colors,</v>

1441
00:36:03.631 --> 00:36:06.840
<v Speaker 4>but they were that shape and that size of these things.</v>

1442
00:36:07.230 --> 00:36:07.650
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1443
00:36:07.650 --> 00:36:11.310
<v Speaker 4>so like you're tuning into it but not totally correctly.</v>

1444
00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:16.200
<v Speaker 4>Like as if you're on a station and the colors are all off and the fucking,</v>

1445
00:36:16.201 --> 00:36:19.010
<v Speaker 4>the cop outfit is white instead of blue.</v>

1446
00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:22.080
<v Speaker 4>It's like in that skin is blue instead of white.</v>

1447
00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:22.560
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1448
00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:23.393
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

1449
00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:23.881
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1450
00:36:23.881 --> 00:36:24.300
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1451
00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:25.860
<v Speaker 4>so that was going on and then after I,</v>

1452
00:36:25.861 --> 00:36:26.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1453
00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:26.970
<v Speaker 4>got used to that,</v>

1454
00:36:26.971 --> 00:36:31.971
<v Speaker 4>then it switched and I kept sliding down these binds of thorns that were just</v>

1455
00:36:32.221 --> 00:36:33.630
<v Speaker 4>ripping me up to pieces.</v>

1456
00:36:33.631 --> 00:36:33.990
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

1457
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:38.250
<v Speaker 4>all of these images were just total destruction of the flesh and know you</v>

1458
00:36:38.251 --> 00:36:40.110
<v Speaker 4>feeling anything while this is happening,</v>

1459
00:36:40.150 --> 00:36:42.300
<v Speaker 4>you're kind of a passive observer of your,</v>

1460
00:36:42.301 --> 00:36:42.600
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1461
00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:43.433
<v Speaker 4>of your body,</v>

1462
00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:46.680
<v Speaker 4>seeing it in a third person or yet outside of your body,</v>

1463
00:36:47.010 --> 00:36:48.000
<v Speaker 4>about two feet,</v>

1464
00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:51.030
<v Speaker 4>about two feet outside of your body as you're watching this happen to you.</v>

1465
00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:53.010
<v Speaker 4>So you're like looking down on it.</v>

1466
00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:53.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1467
00:36:53.450 --> 00:36:54.120
<v Speaker 4>kind of like,</v>

1468
00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:54.480
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1469
00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:56.940
<v Speaker 4>up here on your shoulder a bit and just destruction,</v>

1470
00:36:56.941 --> 00:36:57.601
<v Speaker 4>destruction.</v>

1471
00:36:57.601 --> 00:36:58.350
<v Speaker 4>And I was,</v>

1472
00:36:58.350 --> 00:36:59.183
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1473
00:36:59.300 --> 00:37:01.980
<v Speaker 4>I remember thinking myself because I was naked when this was happening.</v>

1474
00:37:01.981 --> 00:37:02.281
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1475
00:37:02.281 --> 00:37:04.020
<v Speaker 4>why did I have to be naked in this thing?</v>

1476
00:37:04.021 --> 00:37:05.200
<v Speaker 4>But that's just the way it was.</v>

1477
00:37:05.201 --> 00:37:07.260
<v Speaker 4>It just me naked flash,</v>

1478
00:37:07.261 --> 00:37:08.530
<v Speaker 4>just getting torn slide.</v>

1479
00:37:09.350 --> 00:37:13.530
<v Speaker 4>And what do you see seen blood and injuries and yeah,</v>

1480
00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:14.310
<v Speaker 4>you do.</v>

1481
00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:15.031
<v Speaker 4>You see it all.</v>

1482
00:37:15.031 --> 00:37:17.160
<v Speaker 4>I mean just liquid pouring out of your body.</v>

1483
00:37:17.161 --> 00:37:20.160
<v Speaker 4>It's just complete destruction of the physical form.</v>

1484
00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:21.120
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

1485
00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:22.200
<v Speaker 4>and then from there,</v>

1486
00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:22.560
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1487
00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:26.120
<v Speaker 4>insects would burrow into my body and explode and the cheese,</v>

1488
00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:27.690
<v Speaker 4>the spiders and things would go.</v>

1489
00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:29.550
<v Speaker 4>And really that was not,</v>

1490
00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:31.590
<v Speaker 4>that was not so bad actually.</v>

1491
00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:33.720
<v Speaker 4>I though that was kind of a good part.</v>

1492
00:37:33.721 --> 00:37:34.161
<v Speaker 4>But what,</v>

1493
00:37:34.161 --> 00:37:38.010
<v Speaker 4>what Iowasca will do is it will find your own weaknesses and then use them to</v>

1494
00:37:38.011 --> 00:37:38.640
<v Speaker 4>fuck with you.</v>

1495
00:37:38.640 --> 00:37:41.160
<v Speaker 4>It's like when you're at the final level of a video game and it's like,</v>

1496
00:37:41.161 --> 00:37:41.521
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1497
00:37:41.521 --> 00:37:42.870
<v Speaker 4>you must fight yourself.</v>

1498
00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:43.800
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1499
00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:44.820
<v Speaker 4>like that's what it felt like.</v>

1500
00:37:44.821 --> 00:37:48.900
<v Speaker 4>So it started praying on my own fears and I heard a voice telling me exactly</v>

1501
00:37:48.901 --> 00:37:49.740
<v Speaker 4>what I was scared of,</v>

1502
00:37:49.741 --> 00:37:50.370
<v Speaker 4>which is,</v>

1503
00:37:50.370 --> 00:37:50.611
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1504
00:37:50.611 --> 00:37:51.060
<v Speaker 4>some,</v>

1505
00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:51.631
<v Speaker 4>some illness,</v>

1506
00:37:51.631 --> 00:37:52.860
<v Speaker 4>my family's had some lymphoma,</v>

1507
00:37:52.940 --> 00:37:53.970
<v Speaker 4>my shoes or something like that.</v>

1508
00:37:53.971 --> 00:37:55.560
<v Speaker 4>So it basically said,</v>

1509
00:37:55.890 --> 00:37:57.030
<v Speaker 4>you're going to die of cancer,</v>

1510
00:37:57.090 --> 00:37:57.331
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1511
00:37:57.331 --> 00:37:58.141
<v Speaker 4>say your goodbyes,</v>

1512
00:37:58.141 --> 00:37:58.861
<v Speaker 4>you're fucking done.</v>

1513
00:37:58.861 --> 00:37:59.251
<v Speaker 4>You got it.</v>

1514
00:37:59.251 --> 00:38:00.450
<v Speaker 4>Now it's bad.</v>

1515
00:38:00.690 --> 00:38:00.960
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1516
00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:04.410
<v Speaker 4>And it was telling me that and that actually started to shake me a little bit,</v>

1517
00:38:04.590 --> 00:38:04.801
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1518
00:38:04.801 --> 00:38:08.100
<v Speaker 4>because I've never had it work against myself,</v>

1519
00:38:08.101 --> 00:38:11.250
<v Speaker 4>work against me in that kind of magnitude.</v>

1520
00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:11.581
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1521
00:38:11.581 --> 00:38:15.270
<v Speaker 4>I've had visions of things before that were dark and I always worked through and</v>

1522
00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:15.410
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1523
00:38:15.410 --> 00:38:15.590
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1524
00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:16.440
<v Speaker 4>I ended up feeling good,</v>

1525
00:38:16.441 --> 00:38:19.950
<v Speaker 4>but that was a more challenging experience in.</v>

1526
00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:21.540
<v Speaker 4>And then at a certain point,</v>

1527
00:38:21.541 --> 00:38:21.781
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1528
00:38:21.781 --> 00:38:24.000
<v Speaker 4>I had to just apply the same philosophy and say,</v>

1529
00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:24.960
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

1530
00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:25.890
<v Speaker 4>if this is the end,</v>

1531
00:38:26.190 --> 00:38:28.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm gonna have a fucking hell of a six months,</v>

1532
00:38:28.290 --> 00:38:28.651
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1533
00:38:28.651 --> 00:38:32.760
<v Speaker 4>and I'm going to do everything I can and enjoy my life and then boom,</v>

1534
00:38:32.910 --> 00:38:33.743
<v Speaker 4>that ended.</v>

1535
00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:38.350
<v Speaker 4>And then finally at that point I was able to get a sense of peace and I felt</v>

1536
00:38:38.351 --> 00:38:40.420
<v Speaker 4>myself getting sucked back down into the earth.</v>

1537
00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:41.680
<v Speaker 4>Kind of like in the,</v>

1538
00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:43.780
<v Speaker 4>the only thing I can describe is that movie Avatar,</v>

1539
00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:44.201
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1540
00:38:44.201 --> 00:38:48.310
<v Speaker 4>in the little fibers grow up around the body and it like connects it back down</v>

1541
00:38:48.311 --> 00:38:49.030
<v Speaker 4>to the earth.</v>

1542
00:38:49.030 --> 00:38:53.680
<v Speaker 4>I felt this deep relaxation just like right back down into the earth.</v>

1543
00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:54.491
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

1544
00:38:54.491 --> 00:38:55.324
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1545
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:56.050
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1546
00:38:56.050 --> 00:38:57.310
<v Speaker 4>that was kind of the end.</v>

1547
00:38:57.311 --> 00:38:59.980
<v Speaker 4>That was the climax of this first experience for me.</v>

1548
00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:03.460
<v Speaker 4>Did you get a sense that it was a purposeful trip?</v>

1549
00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:05.170
<v Speaker 4>The only reason why they,</v>

1550
00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:08.620
<v Speaker 4>it takes you on this destruction of your body and the snakes and everything like</v>

1551
00:39:08.621 --> 00:39:09.040
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

1552
00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:12.370
<v Speaker 4>Is it supposed to scare the fuck out of you to break you down?</v>

1553
00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:12.820
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>

1554
00:39:12.820 --> 00:39:13.631
<v Speaker 4>it's supposed to.</v>

1555
00:39:13.631 --> 00:39:16.450
<v Speaker 4>It's a death rebirth motif really is what it is.</v>

1556
00:39:16.451 --> 00:39:17.080
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>

1557
00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:17.321
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1558
00:39:17.321 --> 00:39:19.440
<v Speaker 4>that was the idea of the medicine and the night each,</v>

1559
00:39:19.530 --> 00:39:22.870
<v Speaker 4>each night the medicine had a theme and the first night it was Anaconda medicine</v>

1560
00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:23.771
<v Speaker 4>snake medicine,</v>

1561
00:39:23.771 --> 00:39:25.960
<v Speaker 4>which is shedding your skin in one piece.</v>

1562
00:39:26.170 --> 00:39:27.370
<v Speaker 4>So like a snake does it,</v>

1563
00:39:27.371 --> 00:39:28.810
<v Speaker 4>snake sheds its skin all in one piece.</v>

1564
00:39:28.811 --> 00:39:31.150
<v Speaker 4>This was about shedding everything that you don't need,</v>

1565
00:39:31.151 --> 00:39:31.984
<v Speaker 4>your fears,</v>

1566
00:39:32.380 --> 00:39:33.280
<v Speaker 4>your weaknesses,</v>

1567
00:39:33.281 --> 00:39:34.114
<v Speaker 4>all of that.</v>

1568
00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:35.320
<v Speaker 4>And that's why you explore it.</v>

1569
00:39:35.321 --> 00:39:38.080
<v Speaker 4>And I think part of the intent of what the Shaman was doing,</v>

1570
00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:41.770
<v Speaker 4>which meanwhile by the way is as we're growing and intensity and it was like the</v>

1571
00:39:41.771 --> 00:39:43.270
<v Speaker 4>room was swirling with a voice.</v>

1572
00:39:43.271 --> 00:39:43.991
<v Speaker 4>You have a CD,</v>

1573
00:39:43.991 --> 00:39:44.800
<v Speaker 4>like a mixed tape.</v>

1574
00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:45.850
<v Speaker 4>I would love to see that.</v>

1575
00:39:45.851 --> 00:39:46.930
<v Speaker 4>He has a youtube video,</v>

1576
00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:47.830
<v Speaker 4>which I bought some,</v>

1577
00:39:47.831 --> 00:39:50.380
<v Speaker 4>I bought some Ikaros online once,</v>

1578
00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:53.220
<v Speaker 4>listened to it for five minutes and it wasn't high enough and I shut her off.</v>

1579
00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.193
<v Speaker 4>He has a website.</v>

1580
00:39:56.370 --> 00:39:56.650
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1581
00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:57.190
<v Speaker 4>he does,</v>

1582
00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:57.551
<v Speaker 4>he does.</v>

1583
00:39:57.551 --> 00:39:58.420
<v Speaker 4>He has a youtube video.</v>

1584
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:59.291
<v Speaker 4>What does he have?</v>

1585
00:39:59.291 --> 00:39:59.681
<v Speaker 4>A website,</v>

1586
00:39:59.681 --> 00:40:00.514
<v Speaker 4>which is website.</v>

1587
00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:01.301
<v Speaker 4>Oh Man.</v>

1588
00:40:01.301 --> 00:40:01.620
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1589
00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:02.540
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't tell it was,</v>

1590
00:40:02.541 --> 00:40:03.281
<v Speaker 4>it's in Spanish,</v>

1591
00:40:03.281 --> 00:40:03.491
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1592
00:40:03.491 --> 00:40:05.110
<v Speaker 4>so I can't recall it on the top of my head.</v>

1593
00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:09.250

<v Speaker 4>It takes me a while.</v>

1637
00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:54.860
<v Speaker 4>It takes me a while to get through it.</v>

1638
00:40:56.070 --> 00:40:56.380
<v Speaker 4>Don't,</v>

1641
00:40:58.750 --> 00:40:59.680
<v Speaker 4>Let's not play that video.</v>

1642
00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:01.510
<v Speaker 4>I want to hear all this shit.</v>

1643
00:41:01.570 --> 00:41:02.403
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1644
00:41:02.410 --> 00:41:02.771
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

1645
00:41:02.771 --> 00:41:03.340
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1646
00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:03.671
<v Speaker 4>so yeah,</v>

1647
00:41:03.671 --> 00:41:04.240
<v Speaker 4>so that,</v>

1648
00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:04.420
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1649
00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:05.380
<v Speaker 4>that first experience.</v>

1650
00:41:05.381 --> 00:41:06.910
<v Speaker 4>So after he comes by,</v>

1651
00:41:06.911 --> 00:41:07.940
<v Speaker 4>the Shaman comes by.</v>

1652
00:41:07.941 --> 00:41:08.411
<v Speaker 4>He asked me,</v>

1653
00:41:08.411 --> 00:41:09.320
<v Speaker 4>I'll call my mustache.</v>

1654
00:41:09.670 --> 00:41:10.131
<v Speaker 4>I say,</v>

1655
00:41:10.131 --> 00:41:10.960
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1656
00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:11.231
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1657
00:41:11.231 --> 00:41:13.690
<v Speaker 4>I managed to muster something like [inaudible].</v>

1658
00:41:13.930 --> 00:41:15.120
<v Speaker 4>I told him I was dead.</v>

1659
00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:15.993
<v Speaker 4>Good and dead.</v>

1660
00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:17.320
<v Speaker 4>And he just laughed and,</v>

1661
00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:18.340
<v Speaker 4>and kind of that was,</v>

1662
00:41:18.341 --> 00:41:19.174
<v Speaker 4>I think when we,</v>

1663
00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:19.721
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1664
00:41:19.721 --> 00:41:23.020
<v Speaker 4>he started to kind of give me a little bit of respect because the rest of the</v>

1665
00:41:23.021 --> 00:41:24.160
<v Speaker 4>room was just crushed,</v>

1666
00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:24.761
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1667
00:41:24.761 --> 00:41:25.100
<v Speaker 4>but I,</v>

1668
00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:26.140
<v Speaker 4>I was crushed too,</v>

1669
00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:26.921
<v Speaker 4>but at least,</v>

1670
00:41:26.921 --> 00:41:27.161
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1671
00:41:27.161 --> 00:41:28.510
<v Speaker 4>I was able to sit up and,</v>

1672
00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:29.350
<v Speaker 4>and uh,</v>

1673
00:41:29.350 --> 00:41:31.390
<v Speaker 4>and Kinda deal with it a little bit.</v>

1674
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:31.691
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1675
00:41:31.691 --> 00:41:32.290
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1676
00:41:32.290 --> 00:41:35.360
<v Speaker 4>he brings me over this to where he's at and he,</v>

1677
00:41:35.361 --> 00:41:36.194
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1678
00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:39.890
<v Speaker 4>he starts chewing up some cinnamon and it's the final closing ceremony in the</v>

1679
00:41:39.891 --> 00:41:43.790
<v Speaker 4>cleansing ritual and he has me open the back of my shirt and he goes,</v>

1680
00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:44.810
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>

1681
00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:47.450
<v Speaker 4>With the cinnamon and the instant he did that,</v>

1682
00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:49.640
<v Speaker 4>it was like I was on a bungee cord and just,</v>

1683
00:41:49.710 --> 00:41:51.530
<v Speaker 4>and this is six hours after I'd taken it,</v>

1684
00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:51.981
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1685
00:41:51.981 --> 00:41:52.370
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>

1686
00:41:52.370 --> 00:41:57.370
<v Speaker 4>the peak of my trip was completely done and I just went straight up and right</v>

1687
00:41:57.471 --> 00:42:02.060
<v Speaker 4>into this world of just pure energetic vibration that I had no idea how to</v>

1688
00:42:02.061 --> 00:42:02.810
<v Speaker 4>decode.</v>

1689
00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:06.080
<v Speaker 4>It was something completely foreign to anything I've ever seen.</v>

1690
00:42:06.081 --> 00:42:07.340
<v Speaker 4>What did he do with the cinnamon?</v>

1691
00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.300
<v Speaker 4>So he chews it up.</v>

1692
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:10.190
<v Speaker 4>He's like cinnamon six dried cinnamon,</v>

1693
00:42:10.210 --> 00:42:10.910
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

1694
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:12.560
<v Speaker 4>And then he blows his breath.</v>

1695
00:42:12.561 --> 00:42:13.394
<v Speaker 4>He goes sure.</v>

1696
00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:14.270
<v Speaker 4>And forums,</v>

1697
00:42:14.270 --> 00:42:16.280
<v Speaker 4>like a little sonic missile thing.</v>

1698
00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:19.360
<v Speaker 4>And he put the points that at different parts of your different parts of it,</v>

1699
00:42:19.370 --> 00:42:20.600
<v Speaker 4>like the back of your neck,</v>

1700
00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:21.590
<v Speaker 4>the top of your head.</v>

1701
00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:24.260
<v Speaker 4>So he did it four times and each time he did it,</v>

1702
00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:27.860
<v Speaker 4>I had like 10 seconds swimming in this world that just,</v>

1703
00:42:27.890 --> 00:42:30.140
<v Speaker 4>I had no possible chance that decode.</v>

1704
00:42:30.141 --> 00:42:31.790
<v Speaker 4>And it was unbelievable.</v>

1705
00:42:31.791 --> 00:42:32.061
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1706
00:42:32.061 --> 00:42:33.410
<v Speaker 4>what the hell is this?</v>

1707
00:42:33.411 --> 00:42:34.250
<v Speaker 4>Where am I?</v>

1708
00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:34.730
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1709
00:42:34.730 --> 00:42:35.870
<v Speaker 4>how do I understand it?</v>

1710
00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:36.830
<v Speaker 4>What does it mean?</v>

1711
00:42:37.130 --> 00:42:37.371
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1712
00:42:37.371 --> 00:42:38.330
<v Speaker 4>like the youtube video.</v>

1713
00:42:38.331 --> 00:42:41.990
<v Speaker 4>But it was wild on that closing part of the ceremony.</v>

1714
00:42:42.010 --> 00:42:43.010
<v Speaker 4>So what did,</v>

1715
00:42:43.070 --> 00:42:45.060
<v Speaker 4>what did it mean you can't decide?</v>

1716
00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:45.561
<v Speaker 4>You coded?</v>

1717
00:42:45.561 --> 00:42:46.490
<v Speaker 4>Can you describe,</v>

1718
00:42:46.491 --> 00:42:49.730
<v Speaker 4>it was like a geometrical city of light and vibration,</v>

1719
00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:50.331
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1720
00:42:50.331 --> 00:42:50.991
<v Speaker 4>But it was like,</v>

1721
00:42:50.991 --> 00:42:52.010
<v Speaker 4>it was like looking at,</v>

1722
00:42:52.220 --> 00:42:55.040
<v Speaker 4>imagine if you didn't know anything about computer code and you looked at the</v>

1723
00:42:55.041 --> 00:42:55.581
<v Speaker 4>matrix,</v>

1724
00:42:55.581 --> 00:42:56.180
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1725
00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:57.590
<v Speaker 4>And all you saw were ones and zeroes.</v>

1726
00:42:57.591 --> 00:42:57.771
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1727
00:42:57.771 --> 00:42:58.191
<v Speaker 4>Now we know,</v>

1728
00:42:58.191 --> 00:42:59.330
<v Speaker 4>oh that's computer code.</v>

1729
00:42:59.331 --> 00:43:00.140
<v Speaker 4>It's source code.</v>

1730
00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:02.660
<v Speaker 4>It was like that kind of information was coming to me,</v>

1731
00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:03.580
<v Speaker 4>but I just,</v>

1732
00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:04.120
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>

1733
00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:05.780
<v Speaker 4>that sounds like a DMT trip.</v>

1734
00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:06.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1735
00:43:06.530 --> 00:43:07.700
<v Speaker 4>So you have a flash,</v>

1736
00:43:07.701 --> 00:43:08.810
<v Speaker 4>you have a DMT flash,</v>

1737
00:43:08.811 --> 00:43:11.990
<v Speaker 4>so like in deep into another blowing cinnamon on you.</v>

1738
00:43:11.991 --> 00:43:13.160
<v Speaker 4>And that's what causes that.</v>

1739
00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:13.641
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1740
00:43:13.641 --> 00:43:15.680
<v Speaker 4>I dunno if the cinnamon is just to make the,</v>

1741
00:43:15.681 --> 00:43:16.160
<v Speaker 4>his blood,</v>

1742
00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:19.370
<v Speaker 4>his breath pleasant and it's as intent or whether it actually has some part of</v>

1743
00:43:19.371 --> 00:43:23.180
<v Speaker 4>it or distract you while some guy has a needle in the back of your neck and just</v>

1744
00:43:23.310 --> 00:43:24.370
<v Speaker 4>jam oily.</v>

1745
00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:25.730
<v Speaker 4>Lobotomizing no,</v>

1746
00:43:25.731 --> 00:43:26.390
<v Speaker 4>but it was,</v>

1747
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.600
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1748
00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:28.940
<v Speaker 4>whatever he did in that closing part of it,</v>

1749
00:43:28.941 --> 00:43:29.240
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1750
00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:31.730
<v Speaker 4>I felt like it opened a breach in something else.</v>

1751
00:43:31.731 --> 00:43:33.470
<v Speaker 4>A different place for 10 seconds,</v>

1752
00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:34.131
<v Speaker 4>for 10 seconds,</v>

1753
00:43:34.131 --> 00:43:36.050
<v Speaker 4>then suck back as soon as soon as that was over,</v>

1754
00:43:36.051 --> 00:43:37.040
<v Speaker 4>I was right back.</v>

1755
00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:37.370
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1756
00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:37.970
<v Speaker 4>wouldn't laugh.</v>

1757
00:43:37.970 --> 00:43:38.211
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1758
00:43:38.211 --> 00:43:39.580
<v Speaker 4>So this is day one they want,</v>

1759
00:43:39.581 --> 00:43:42.410
<v Speaker 4>so then do you get up in the morning?</v>

1760
00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:43.490
<v Speaker 4>Do you go to bed?</v>

1761
00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:44.150
<v Speaker 4>Go to bed?</v>

1762
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.360
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1763
00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:45.560
<v Speaker 4>show off to Puke.</v>

1764
00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:45.921
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1765
00:43:45.921 --> 00:43:46.090
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

1766
00:43:46.090 --> 00:43:46.281
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1767
00:43:46.281 --> 00:43:46.971
<v Speaker 4>So I went,</v>

1768
00:43:46.971 --> 00:43:47.630
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1769
00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:48.830
<v Speaker 4>took care of everything in the,</v>

1770
00:43:48.831 --> 00:43:49.370
<v Speaker 4>in the,</v>

1771
00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:49.811
<v Speaker 4>in the dark,</v>

1772
00:43:49.811 --> 00:43:51.200
<v Speaker 4>in my hot and the dark.</v>

1773
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:51.730
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1774
00:43:51.730 --> 00:43:52.640
<v Speaker 4>It cold and dark.</v>

1775
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.410
<v Speaker 4>There's no light at all.</v>

1776
00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:59.000
<v Speaker 4>No light at no candles are using our phones and flashlights and they have the</v>

1777
00:43:59.001 --> 00:44:00.140
<v Speaker 4>charger for your phone.</v>

1778
00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:01.060
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1779
00:44:01.060 --> 00:44:01.910
<v Speaker 4>three hours a day.</v>

1780
00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:03.960
<v Speaker 4>You can charge it for three hours a day.</v>

1781
00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:04.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1782
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:05.520
<v Speaker 4>So you're using your phone,</v>

1783
00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:05.760
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1784
00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:06.480
<v Speaker 4>getting service.</v>

1785
00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:07.700
<v Speaker 4>So it's just a flashlight,</v>

1786
00:44:07.701 --> 00:44:08.331
<v Speaker 4>a little flashlight,</v>

1787
00:44:08.331 --> 00:44:09.290
<v Speaker 4>expensive iPhone,</v>

1788
00:44:09.291 --> 00:44:09.920
<v Speaker 4>flashlight.</v>

1789
00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:10.251
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>

1790
00:44:10.251 --> 00:44:12.260
<v Speaker 4>so you wash yourself off.</v>

1791
00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:12.530
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1792
00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:13.970
<v Speaker 4>Crash out and you sleep.</v>

1793
00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:18.140
<v Speaker 4>I did fucking freaking out while you're sleeping and you slept good.</v>

1794
00:44:18.170 --> 00:44:18.921
<v Speaker 4>I felt pretty good,</v>

1795
00:44:18.921 --> 00:44:19.160
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1796
00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:22.970
<v Speaker 4>after that final thing where I was able to relax and felt sucked back into the</v>

1797
00:44:22.971 --> 00:44:23.610
<v Speaker 4>earth,</v>

1798
00:44:23.610 --> 00:44:24.110
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1799
00:44:24.110 --> 00:44:24.711
<v Speaker 4>I felt good.</v>

1800
00:44:24.711 --> 00:44:24.921
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1801
00:44:24.921 --> 00:44:28.250
<v Speaker 4>I felt like I learned the importance of the physical realm.</v>

1802
00:44:28.310 --> 00:44:28.920
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1803
00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:29.060
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

1804
00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:30.740
<v Speaker 4>next day breakfast is,</v>

1805
00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:32.100
<v Speaker 4>do people apologize</v>

1806
00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:32.933
<v Speaker 1>for throwing out money?</v>

1807
00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:33.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1808
00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:34.530
<v Speaker 4>Some people were still,</v>

1809
00:44:34.531 --> 00:44:35.880
<v Speaker 4>some people are still pretty,</v>

1810
00:44:36.030 --> 00:44:36.660
<v Speaker 4>pretty shocked.</v>

1811
00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:38.280
<v Speaker 4>Like the people in my group were pretty shocked.</v>

1812
00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:39.510
<v Speaker 4>A lot of them didn't go back.</v>

1813
00:44:39.540 --> 00:44:40.830
<v Speaker 4>Some of them didn't do it again.</v>

1814
00:44:40.831 --> 00:44:41.031
<v Speaker 4>The whole,</v>

1815
00:44:41.031 --> 00:44:41.750
<v Speaker 4>it's really,</v>

1816
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:42.450
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

1817
00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:42.991
<v Speaker 4>I mean they,</v>

1818
00:44:42.991 --> 00:44:43.560
<v Speaker 4>they weren't,</v>

1819
00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:44.220
<v Speaker 4>they fought it.</v>

1820
00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:45.390
<v Speaker 4>They fought the whole time.</v>

1821
00:44:45.540 --> 00:44:46.740
<v Speaker 4>And if you fight the whole time,</v>

1822
00:44:46.741 --> 00:44:48.360
<v Speaker 4>you never release from it.</v>

1823
00:44:48.450 --> 00:44:48.631
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1824
00:44:48.631 --> 00:44:49.590
<v Speaker 4>you don't work through it.</v>

1825
00:44:49.591 --> 00:44:53.730
<v Speaker 4>It's like you get brought to the heat of the battle and then you just ignore it</v>

1826
00:44:53.731 --> 00:44:55.620
<v Speaker 4>and shut your eyes and it goes away.</v>

1827
00:44:55.621 --> 00:44:56.610
<v Speaker 4>But it sticks with you.</v>

1828
00:44:56.611 --> 00:44:57.210
<v Speaker 4>And that's,</v>

1829
00:44:57.210 --> 00:44:58.043
<v Speaker 4>that's one thing that,</v>

1830
00:44:58.140 --> 00:44:58.860
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1831
00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:02.760
<v Speaker 4>a caution for doing any kind of psychedelic work is you've got to work through</v>

1832
00:45:02.761 --> 00:45:03.594
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

1833
00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:05.640
<v Speaker 4>So for her it was a very,</v>

1834
00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.190
<v Speaker 4>she just had very repetitive visions.</v>

1835
00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:08.780
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1836
00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:09.000
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1837
00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.620
<v Speaker 4>I was surprised that it didn't take her deeper,</v>

1838
00:45:10.621 --> 00:45:12.870
<v Speaker 4>but she was working with some of the lighter,</v>

1839
00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:15.180
<v Speaker 4>lighter doses in the lighter schamens.</v>

1840
00:45:15.450 --> 00:45:15.841
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1841
00:45:15.841 --> 00:45:17.130
<v Speaker 4>and they could tell that she was,</v>

1842
00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:18.480
<v Speaker 4>the way that they dose.</v>

1843
00:45:18.481 --> 00:45:19.350
<v Speaker 4>He was pretty smart.</v>

1844
00:45:19.351 --> 00:45:21.120
<v Speaker 4>Usually they try and dose you to what,</v>

1845
00:45:21.330 --> 00:45:21.461
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1846
00:45:21.461 --> 00:45:22.560
<v Speaker 4>what they think you can handle.</v>

1847
00:45:23.130 --> 00:45:23.311
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

1848
00:45:23.311 --> 00:45:24.020
<v Speaker 4>but she was great.</v>

1849
00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:24.320
<v Speaker 4>She's,</v>

1850
00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:28.590
<v Speaker 1>it seems to me that just jumping right into an IOWASCA trip without any previous</v>

1851
00:45:28.591 --> 00:45:32.430
<v Speaker 1>psychedelic experiences like taking no martial arts classes and fighting in the</v>

1852
00:45:32.431 --> 00:45:33.264
<v Speaker 1>UFC,</v>

1853
00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:35.160
<v Speaker 1>it just seems ridiculous.</v>

1854
00:45:35.490 --> 00:45:36.510
<v Speaker 1>I wouldn't,</v>

1855
00:45:36.511 --> 00:45:40.290
<v Speaker 1>you want to build your way up slowly and smoke some Salvia eat a Brownie,</v>

1856
00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:41.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1857
00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:43.440
<v Speaker 1>slowly legs into the river.</v>

1858
00:45:43.441 --> 00:45:45.720
<v Speaker 1>That is the second dog experience cause the,</v>

1859
00:45:45.830 --> 00:45:49.080
<v Speaker 1>the Iowasca experience in DMT experiences is supposed to be the two most</v>

1860
00:45:49.081 --> 00:45:51.990
<v Speaker 1>powerful that you can never have back to back.</v>

1861
00:45:52.210 --> 00:45:53.043
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1862
00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:57.270
<v Speaker 1>one being a bit more on the spiritual side of the Iowasca that's supposedly</v>

1863
00:45:57.271 --> 00:46:02.271
<v Speaker 1>because it's longer and not as intense that it sort of connects you in a way</v>

1864
00:46:02.311 --> 00:46:05.700
<v Speaker 1>that you can interpret better than the DMT flash.</v>

1865
00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:06.150
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1866
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:11.150
<v Speaker 1>the DMT flash a lot of times just so mind bogglingly alien that it's,</v>

1867
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:13.230
<v Speaker 1>there's no words for it.</v>

1868
00:46:13.231 --> 00:46:14.910
<v Speaker 1>You come back with a lot of confusion.</v>

1869
00:46:14.911 --> 00:46:16.830
<v Speaker 1>Like there's some message in it somewhere,</v>

1870
00:46:16.831 --> 00:46:18.180
<v Speaker 1>but it takes a while to decode.</v>

1871
00:46:18.290 --> 00:46:20.270
<v Speaker 4>I talked to them about smoking DMT as well.</v>

1872
00:46:20.271 --> 00:46:21.320
<v Speaker 4>And I'll get to that when I get,</v>

1873
00:46:21.321 --> 00:46:24.830
<v Speaker 4>I kind of have to set up kind of the paradigm first and then I'll tell you what</v>

1874
00:46:24.831 --> 00:46:27.350
<v Speaker 4>they said about smoking DMT versus taking ios.</v>

1875
00:46:27.450 --> 00:46:29.250
<v Speaker 1>So did you go right back in the second day?</v>

1876
00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:29.841
<v Speaker 4>Second day,</v>

1877
00:46:29.841 --> 00:46:30.140
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1878
00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:31.850
<v Speaker 4>Second day I just rested,</v>

1879
00:46:31.851 --> 00:46:32.780
<v Speaker 4>wrote in my journal,</v>

1880
00:46:32.930 --> 00:46:34.550
<v Speaker 4>made sure to kind of digest the,</v>

1881
00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:35.090
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1882
00:46:35.090 --> 00:46:35.811
<v Speaker 4>what I had gone through.</v>

1883
00:46:35.811 --> 00:46:37.820
<v Speaker 4>It's very energetically taxing,</v>

1884
00:46:37.821 --> 00:46:39.260
<v Speaker 4>but I felt fucking great.</v>

1885
00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:41.030
<v Speaker 4>Like I felt reborn,</v>

1886
00:46:41.031 --> 00:46:41.870
<v Speaker 4>like energetic.</v>

1887
00:46:41.871 --> 00:46:44.000
<v Speaker 4>I slept five hours and I was just pumped.</v>

1888
00:46:44.001 --> 00:46:48.620
<v Speaker 4>Like I got a good workout in and I felt more alive than I have been in a long</v>

1889
00:46:48.621 --> 00:46:48.891
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>

1890
00:46:48.891 --> 00:46:49.580
<v Speaker 4>It was rad.</v>

1891
00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:51.140
<v Speaker 4>Like I felt my body felt great,</v>

1892
00:46:51.141 --> 00:46:52.160
<v Speaker 4>my mind felt great,</v>

1893
00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:53.390
<v Speaker 4>my spirit felt great.</v>

1894
00:46:53.391 --> 00:46:55.550
<v Speaker 4>I felt like I learned some valuable lessons about,</v>

1895
00:46:56.110 --> 00:46:56.390
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1896
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:59.780
<v Speaker 4>the d importance of the physical realm and I feel like I conquered some deep</v>

1897
00:46:59.781 --> 00:47:02.540
<v Speaker 4>fears about cancer and shit that was going on.</v>

1898
00:47:02.541 --> 00:47:05.600
<v Speaker 4>Like it was it like I'm not worried about that anymore.</v>

1899
00:47:05.601 --> 00:47:07.580
<v Speaker 4>Like it took me there to overcome it.</v>

1900
00:47:07.581 --> 00:47:08.361
<v Speaker 4>And you know,</v>

1901
00:47:08.361 --> 00:47:10.220
<v Speaker 4>really that first night for me was,</v>

1902
00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:10.551
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1903
00:47:10.551 --> 00:47:10.631
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1904
00:47:10.631 --> 00:47:11.660
<v Speaker 4>I call it my death.</v>

1905
00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:15.050
<v Speaker 4>It was like the old parts of me that night died,</v>

1906
00:47:15.090 --> 00:47:15.650
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1907
00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:16.580
<v Speaker 4>anything week,</v>

1908
00:47:16.770 --> 00:47:16.970
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1909
00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:18.650
<v Speaker 4>was killed off by the IOWASCA.</v>

1910
00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:20.000
<v Speaker 4>But it's funny you said that,</v>

1911
00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:20.290
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1912
00:47:20.290 --> 00:47:22.820
<v Speaker 4>the UFC analogy I wrote in my blog,</v>

1913
00:47:22.821 --> 00:47:23.480
<v Speaker 4>it was like,</v>

1914
00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:25.550
<v Speaker 4>it was like I was kind of with a bunch of karate,</v>

1915
00:47:25.551 --> 00:47:27.200
<v Speaker 4>black belts and you know,</v>

1916
00:47:27.201 --> 00:47:29.500
<v Speaker 4>they took Iowasca and just got punched the face.</v>

1917
00:47:29.670 --> 00:47:30.011
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1918
00:47:30.011 --> 00:47:32.020
<v Speaker 4>why the hell is going on here?</v>

1919
00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:32.651
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

1920
00:47:32.651 --> 00:47:33.484
<v Speaker 4>And they didn't really,</v>

1921
00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:34.510
<v Speaker 4>they had the training,</v>

1922
00:47:34.750 --> 00:47:36.310
<v Speaker 4>but it's different when you're in a street fight,</v>

1923
00:47:36.550 --> 00:47:36.851
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1924
00:47:36.851 --> 00:47:37.684
<v Speaker 4>And that's uh,</v>

1925
00:47:37.870 --> 00:47:38.770
<v Speaker 4>that's kind of what it was.</v>

1926
00:47:38.771 --> 00:47:39.670
<v Speaker 4>I didn't have the training,</v>

1927
00:47:39.671 --> 00:47:41.680
<v Speaker 4>but I've been in a few brawls in my day.</v>

1928
00:47:41.681 --> 00:47:44.890
<v Speaker 4>So I think that that ends up being a bit more important,</v>

1929
00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:45.820
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1930
00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:47.860
<v Speaker 4>as far as being able to handle the experience.</v>

1931
00:47:48.010 --> 00:47:48.490
<v Speaker 4>But then,</v>

1932
00:47:48.490 --> 00:47:48.731
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1933
00:47:48.731 --> 00:47:49.451
<v Speaker 4>at another point,</v>

1934
00:47:49.451 --> 00:47:50.284
<v Speaker 4>the second night,</v>

1935
00:47:50.410 --> 00:47:54.580
<v Speaker 4>I wish I did have some of their training cause I got an opportunity to do some</v>

1936
00:47:54.581 --> 00:47:55.150
<v Speaker 4>cool shit.</v>

1937
00:47:55.150 --> 00:47:56.110
<v Speaker 4>But I just didn't know what to do.</v>

1938
00:47:56.111 --> 00:47:57.320
<v Speaker 4>So without that,</v>

1939
00:47:57.750 --> 00:47:59.500
<v Speaker 4>so that's the second session I go up to them.</v>

1940
00:47:59.590 --> 00:48:00.670
<v Speaker 4>This is the third day,</v>

1941
00:48:01.330 --> 00:48:02.710
<v Speaker 4>slightly more comfortable room.</v>

1942
00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:03.730
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1943
00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:05.230
<v Speaker 4>the people who from the first session,</v>

1944
00:48:05.231 --> 00:48:06.340
<v Speaker 4>a lot of them ducked out,</v>

1945
00:48:06.370 --> 00:48:06.730
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1946
00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:09.130
<v Speaker 4>but there was new people who like wanted a strong experience.</v>

1947
00:48:09.131 --> 00:48:11.290
<v Speaker 4>So his legend started to spread in the camp.</v>

1948
00:48:11.590 --> 00:48:12.640
<v Speaker 4>So we had a few more people,</v>

1949
00:48:12.641 --> 00:48:13.474
<v Speaker 4>probably 15.</v>

1950
00:48:13.740 --> 00:48:14.320
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1951
00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:16.120
<v Speaker 4>and I went up to him beforehand and I said,</v>

1952
00:48:16.150 --> 00:48:16.391
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1953
00:48:16.391 --> 00:48:18.250
<v Speaker 4>my stress at a medicine,</v>

1954
00:48:18.251 --> 00:48:19.080
<v Speaker 4>a flat Earth Day,</v>

1955
00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:20.000
<v Speaker 4>like exercise,</v>

1956
00:48:20.190 --> 00:48:23.320
<v Speaker 4>like I wanted a strong dose and he looks at me and he smiled and he remembered</v>

1957
00:48:23.321 --> 00:48:24.970
<v Speaker 4>that I handled the last one pretty well.</v>

1958
00:48:24.971 --> 00:48:26.860
<v Speaker 4>So when it was my turn to go up,</v>

1959
00:48:26.861 --> 00:48:28.460
<v Speaker 4>you fills the cup to the brim,</v>

1960
00:48:28.530 --> 00:48:30.600
<v Speaker 4>like to the Brim and uh,</v>

1961
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.880
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1962
00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:32.530
<v Speaker 4>look at it and set my intent.</v>

1963
00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:34.930
<v Speaker 4>My intent was to see how far I could go.</v>

1964
00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:36.370
<v Speaker 4>Like I wanted to go back to that place.</v>

1965
00:48:36.371 --> 00:48:40.330
<v Speaker 4>He showed me at the end of the session and I wanted to experience joy and</v>

1966
00:48:40.360 --> 00:48:42.730
<v Speaker 4>happiness and that side of life the opposite side.</v>

1967
00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:44.170
<v Speaker 4>And just see where it could take me.</v>

1968
00:48:44.171 --> 00:48:46.630
<v Speaker 4>And that was really my goal in doing that.</v>

1969
00:48:46.631 --> 00:48:50.050
<v Speaker 4>And I picked up some tips from some of the other shamans about how to set kind</v>

1970
00:48:50.051 --> 00:48:54.530
<v Speaker 4>of your own spiritual armor and kind of prevent things from interfering and</v>

1971
00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:55.750
<v Speaker 4>taking you off your intent.</v>

1972
00:48:55.751 --> 00:48:56.321
<v Speaker 4>So I was like,</v>

1973
00:48:56.321 --> 00:48:57.190
<v Speaker 4>I felt well equipped,</v>

1974
00:48:57.550 --> 00:48:59.050
<v Speaker 4>drank the full cup three gulps,</v>

1975
00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:00.190
<v Speaker 4>pretty brutal again.</v>

1976
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:01.421
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

1977
00:49:01.421 --> 00:49:02.170
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1978
00:49:02.170 --> 00:49:04.450
<v Speaker 4>then it starts and it starts,</v>

1979
00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:04.750
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1980
00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:06.730
<v Speaker 4>kind of similarly as usual.</v>

1981
00:49:06.820 --> 00:49:07.450
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

1982
00:49:07.450 --> 00:49:07.751
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1983
00:49:07.751 --> 00:49:09.340
<v Speaker 4>an hour in visions,</v>

1984
00:49:09.341 --> 00:49:10.270
<v Speaker 4>things that I remember,</v>

1985
00:49:10.271 --> 00:49:10.481
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1986
00:49:10.481 --> 00:49:11.320
<v Speaker 4>kind of like a psych,</v>

1987
00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:12.550
<v Speaker 4>most psychedelic trips are like,</v>

1988
00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:12.821
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

1989
00:49:12.821 --> 00:49:13.780
<v Speaker 4>I got to remember that.</v>

1990
00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:14.620
<v Speaker 4>That's a good lesson,</v>

1991
00:49:14.621 --> 00:49:14.980
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1992
00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:17.140
<v Speaker 4>take little gems from the visions you see,</v>

1993
00:49:17.141 --> 00:49:17.974
<v Speaker 4>things like that.</v>

1994
00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:18.491
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1995
00:49:18.491 --> 00:49:21.940
<v Speaker 4>at some point some eels came out of the water and they started coming after me</v>

1996
00:49:21.941 --> 00:49:25.300
<v Speaker 4>and it was much like the snakes and I looked at the eels and,</v>

1997
00:49:25.301 --> 00:49:25.530
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1998
00:49:25.530 --> 00:49:25.920
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

1999
00:49:25.920 --> 00:49:26.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2000
00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:28.570
<v Speaker 4>was able to kind of mentally stop them with the armor,</v>

2001
00:49:28.571 --> 00:49:29.500
<v Speaker 4>which was a trick,</v>

2002
00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:29.771
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2003
00:49:29.771 --> 00:49:30.540
<v Speaker 4>opening your winner.</v>

2004
00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:31.390
<v Speaker 4>Coccia it's called.</v>

2005
00:49:31.690 --> 00:49:32.523
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2006
00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:33.011
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>

2007
00:49:33.011 --> 00:49:33.161
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2008
00:49:33.161 --> 00:49:33.521
<v Speaker 4>sweet.</v>

2009
00:49:33.521 --> 00:49:34.354
<v Speaker 4>They stopped.</v>

2010
00:49:34.450 --> 00:49:34.901
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

2011
00:49:34.901 --> 00:49:35.301
<v Speaker 4>what's up?</v>

2012
00:49:35.301 --> 00:49:37.660
<v Speaker 4>He feels like this is not the day for killing me.</v>

2013
00:49:37.930 --> 00:49:41.440
<v Speaker 4>And I just told them that and they like looked at me and they're like,</v>

2014
00:49:41.650 --> 00:49:41.981
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2015
00:49:41.981 --> 00:49:42.221
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2016
00:49:42.221 --> 00:49:43.840
<v Speaker 4>I'll believe you and just bounced.</v>

2017
00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:44.321
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

2018
00:49:44.321 --> 00:49:45.154
<v Speaker 4>sweet,</v>

2019
00:49:45.250 --> 00:49:46.390
<v Speaker 4>I'm not going to die today.</v>

2020
00:49:46.620 --> 00:49:47.350
<v Speaker 4>Like that's awesome.</v>

2021
00:49:47.350 --> 00:49:49.180
<v Speaker 4>They leave and what does it leave you with?</v>

2022
00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:50.200
<v Speaker 4>Well then where are you?</v>

2023
00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:50.331
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2024
00:49:50.331 --> 00:49:53.440
<v Speaker 4>So then from there then from there things,</v>

2025
00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:54.490
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2026
00:49:54.490 --> 00:49:55.323
<v Speaker 4>things got,</v>

2027
00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:57.580
<v Speaker 4>that's when things got started to get crazy.</v>

2028
00:49:57.850 --> 00:50:02.680
<v Speaker 4>Like immediately the sensation of my head just peeling off the top of my head</v>

2029
00:50:02.681 --> 00:50:03.400
<v Speaker 4>happens.</v>

2030
00:50:03.400 --> 00:50:03.881
<v Speaker 4>And Joe,</v>

2031
00:50:03.881 --> 00:50:06.370
<v Speaker 4>I've been in fucking a lot of situations and done some shit.</v>

2032
00:50:06.550 --> 00:50:07.151
<v Speaker 4>Nothing,</v>

2033
00:50:07.151 --> 00:50:07.511
<v Speaker 4>nothing,</v>

2034
00:50:07.511 --> 00:50:09.700
<v Speaker 4>nothing could compare to how this felt.</v>

2035
00:50:09.820 --> 00:50:14.820
<v Speaker 4>It felt like every cell in neuron in my brain was completely sinked in perfect</v>

2036
00:50:15.071 --> 00:50:17.230
<v Speaker 4>alignment and glowing radioactive.</v>

2037
00:50:17.231 --> 00:50:18.910
<v Speaker 4>And I had no top of my head on,</v>

2038
00:50:19.180 --> 00:50:21.250
<v Speaker 4>it was like wall wall.</v>

2039
00:50:21.310 --> 00:50:26.310
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was on real as foreign to me as any sensation and it was a physical</v>

2040
00:50:26.810 --> 00:50:27.321
<v Speaker 4>sensation.</v>

2041
00:50:27.321 --> 00:50:28.580
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't a mental sensation.</v>

2042
00:50:28.730 --> 00:50:33.730
<v Speaker 4>I could physically feel my brain like alive from back from my brainstem all the</v>

2043
00:50:33.951 --> 00:50:34.970
<v Speaker 4>way to the frontal lobe,</v>

2044
00:50:34.971 --> 00:50:37.160
<v Speaker 4>like every part of it was full.</v>

2045
00:50:37.450 --> 00:50:38.283
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

2046
00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:38.841
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

2047
00:50:38.841 --> 00:50:39.320
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>

2048
00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:40.580
<v Speaker 4>Like something's happening here.</v>

2049
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:41.503
<v Speaker 4>Like this is new,</v>

2050
00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:43.020
<v Speaker 4>this is a new ball game.</v>

2051
00:50:43.021 --> 00:50:43.120
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2052
00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:44.150
<v Speaker 4>And what happened from them?</v>

2053
00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:45.013
<v Speaker 4>So from then,</v>

2054
00:50:45.030 --> 00:50:45.863
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2055
00:50:46.250 --> 00:50:47.540
<v Speaker 4>right after that happened,</v>

2056
00:50:47.660 --> 00:50:48.493
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2057
00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:49.400
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2058
00:50:49.400 --> 00:50:52.280
<v Speaker 4>I started to feel really fucking good,</v>

2059
00:50:52.370 --> 00:50:54.110
<v Speaker 4>like really good and,</v>

2060
00:50:54.250 --> 00:50:58.070
<v Speaker 4>and I was looking around the room and people were vomiting and lots of chaos.</v>

2061
00:50:58.071 --> 00:50:59.150
<v Speaker 4>It started around the room,</v>

2062
00:50:59.390 --> 00:51:02.810
<v Speaker 4>but I felt it all is like a kind of like just a cleanse,</v>

2063
00:51:02.811 --> 00:51:02.961
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2064
00:51:02.961 --> 00:51:04.340
<v Speaker 4>like I had a different perspective on it.</v>

2065
00:51:04.341 --> 00:51:09.020
<v Speaker 4>So each one would bring me more like happiness until finally it reached this</v>

2066
00:51:09.021 --> 00:51:10.070
<v Speaker 4>ecstatic state,</v>

2067
00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:13.130
<v Speaker 4>which was about 10 minutes of just pure,</v>

2068
00:51:13.250 --> 00:51:14.750
<v Speaker 4>straight ecstasy.</v>

2069
00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:19.310
<v Speaker 4>Like every cell of my body felt better than it ever had before.</v>

2070
00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:24.340
<v Speaker 4>It was like the exact reason why we're given physical forms was do experience</v>

2071
00:51:24.531 --> 00:51:25.760
<v Speaker 4>some kind of pleasure like this.</v>

2072
00:51:25.940 --> 00:51:26.990
<v Speaker 4>The only thing I compare it to.</v>

2073
00:51:26.991 --> 00:51:28.220
<v Speaker 4>And every time I make this analogy,</v>

2074
00:51:28.221 --> 00:51:29.630
<v Speaker 4>people ask if I nodded my pants,</v>

2075
00:51:29.631 --> 00:51:30.464
<v Speaker 4>which I didn't,</v>

2076
00:51:30.590 --> 00:51:35.590
<v Speaker 4>but it felt like that moment of orgasm stretched for like five minutes,</v>

2077
00:51:35.691 --> 00:51:36.290
<v Speaker 4>10 minutes.</v>

2078
00:51:36.290 --> 00:51:37.610
<v Speaker 4>Like I didn't know where that a yell.</v>

2079
00:51:37.790 --> 00:51:39.320
<v Speaker 4>It was like so crazy,</v>

2080
00:51:39.321 --> 00:51:42.350
<v Speaker 4>intensely bodily good to feel that.</v>

2081
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:43.550
<v Speaker 4>And then,</v>

2082
00:51:43.550 --> 00:51:43.761
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2083
00:51:43.761 --> 00:51:45.500
<v Speaker 4>so experience that and that was rad.</v>

2084
00:51:45.501 --> 00:51:46.334
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2085
00:51:46.580 --> 00:51:46.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2086
00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:48.110
<v Speaker 4>that would have been enough right there.</v>

2087
00:51:48.111 --> 00:51:50.240
<v Speaker 4>But then it just continued to build.</v>

2088
00:51:50.241 --> 00:51:55.241
<v Speaker 4>And so what happened next is this giant organic flotilla of like snakes and</v>

2089
00:51:55.371 --> 00:51:56.870
<v Speaker 4>feathers comes like a China.</v>

2090
00:51:56.900 --> 00:52:00.380
<v Speaker 4>Kind of like an organic mothership comes and it hovers over my head.</v>

2091
00:52:00.381 --> 00:52:00.800
<v Speaker 4>And these,</v>

2092
00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:02.510
<v Speaker 4>this is full open eyed visuals,</v>

2093
00:52:02.511 --> 00:52:03.140
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2094
00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:03.973
<v Speaker 4>How big is this?</v>

2095
00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:05.240
<v Speaker 4>Oh man,</v>

2096
00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:08.420
<v Speaker 4>it was probably 30 yards.</v>

2097
00:52:08.421 --> 00:52:09.254
<v Speaker 4>40 yards.</v>

2098
00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:10.760
<v Speaker 4>Big 30 yards.</v>

2099
00:52:10.790 --> 00:52:11.001
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2100
00:52:11.001 --> 00:52:11.630
<v Speaker 4>it was big.</v>

2101
00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:13.120
<v Speaker 4>It was a massive things.</v>

2102
00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:14.300
<v Speaker 4>Feathers and snake,</v>

2103
00:52:14.310 --> 00:52:16.190
<v Speaker 4>Heather's and snakes and it's living,</v>

2104
00:52:16.191 --> 00:52:16.821
<v Speaker 4>it's a living,</v>

2105
00:52:16.821 --> 00:52:18.470
<v Speaker 4>it's like a living mothership.</v>

2106
00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:19.220
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2107
00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:22.880
<v Speaker 4>And it starts sucking black smoke out of my body and I see it coming out and I</v>

2108
00:52:22.881 --> 00:52:23.150
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>

2109
00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:26.300
<v Speaker 4>oh well I guess I guess I didn't need that.</v>

2110
00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:26.930
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2111
00:52:26.930 --> 00:52:27.321
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

2112
00:52:27.321 --> 00:52:27.801
<v Speaker 4>take it,</v>

2113
00:52:27.801 --> 00:52:28.041
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2114
00:52:28.041 --> 00:52:29.030
<v Speaker 4>like cool.</v>

2115
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:33.050
<v Speaker 4>And it didn't have any physical sensation but I could see it like coming out of</v>

2116
00:52:33.051 --> 00:52:33.411
<v Speaker 4>my body.</v>

2117
00:52:33.411 --> 00:52:34.430
<v Speaker 4>It came out of my throat,</v>

2118
00:52:34.650 --> 00:52:35.600
<v Speaker 4>came out of my head,</v>

2119
00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:36.410
<v Speaker 4>came out of,</v>

2120
00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:37.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2121
00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:37.671
<v Speaker 4>different parts.</v>

2122
00:52:37.671 --> 00:52:38.990
<v Speaker 4>I guess you could correspond them to the,</v>

2123
00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:40.550
<v Speaker 4>to the shockers where they were coming out,</v>

2124
00:52:40.551 --> 00:52:42.140
<v Speaker 4>but just peeling out of my body.</v>

2125
00:52:42.141 --> 00:52:42.471
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2126
00:52:42.471 --> 00:52:43.304
<v Speaker 4>Whoa,</v>

2127
00:52:43.310 --> 00:52:44.143
<v Speaker 4>that's pretty cool.</v>

2128
00:52:44.330 --> 00:52:46.970
<v Speaker 4>And then it just floats off when the smoke started to die off.</v>

2129
00:52:47.300 --> 00:52:48.980
<v Speaker 4>And then right on its heels,</v>

2130
00:52:48.981 --> 00:52:53.330
<v Speaker 4>another mothership comes and this mothership is metallic and it has all kinds of</v>

2131
00:52:53.331 --> 00:52:55.070
<v Speaker 4>crazy cryptic riding on it.</v>

2132
00:52:55.071 --> 00:52:56.270
<v Speaker 4>Like stargate,</v>

2133
00:52:56.271 --> 00:52:57.650
<v Speaker 4>Sgi type of writing.</v>

2134
00:52:57.651 --> 00:52:58.640
<v Speaker 4>It's the only thing I can compare.</v>

2135
00:52:58.641 --> 00:53:03.641
<v Speaker 4>Your eyes are open when you fully and how does it look real?</v>

2136
00:53:04.250 --> 00:53:05.330
<v Speaker 4>Can you see through it?</v>

2137
00:53:05.420 --> 00:53:06.860
<v Speaker 4>Does it look like in an illusion?</v>

2138
00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:08.571
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2139
00:53:08.571 --> 00:53:09.381
<v Speaker 4>you can't see through it.</v>

2140
00:53:09.381 --> 00:53:09.770
<v Speaker 4>You couldn't,</v>

2141
00:53:09.770 --> 00:53:11.600
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't see anything else really,</v>

2142
00:53:11.601 --> 00:53:12.141
<v Speaker 4>honestly.</v>

2143
00:53:12.141 --> 00:53:12.291
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2144
00:53:12.291 --> 00:53:12.680
<v Speaker 4>it was,</v>

2145
00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:13.820
<v Speaker 4>it was black around it.</v>

2146
00:53:13.821 --> 00:53:14.090
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

2147
00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:17.720
<v Speaker 4>my memory of it is that I could just see that and that was it.</v>

2148
00:53:17.810 --> 00:53:20.480
<v Speaker 4>I think if I tried to like focus back on,</v>

2149
00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:20.931
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2150
00:53:20.931 --> 00:53:21.860
<v Speaker 4>my own reality,</v>

2151
00:53:21.861 --> 00:53:23.270
<v Speaker 4>I could see some shit in the room,</v>

2152
00:53:23.271 --> 00:53:24.980
<v Speaker 4>but then that's all I could,</v>

2153
00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:27.960
<v Speaker 4>it was black and it was a ship and that was,</v>

2154
00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:29.430
<v Speaker 4>that was the only thing I was focused on.</v>

2155
00:53:29.460 --> 00:53:32.700
<v Speaker 4>So it looked like an alien spacecraft stay staff fully.</v>

2156
00:53:32.730 --> 00:53:33.120
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2157
00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:33.481
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

2158
00:53:33.481 --> 00:53:33.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2159
00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:34.020
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2160
00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:34.860
<v Speaker 4>very much like that.</v>

2161
00:53:34.890 --> 00:53:38.760
<v Speaker 4>Very much like this shit not quite that big and there's writing on it something,</v>

2162
00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:40.080
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't just smooth,</v>

2163
00:53:40.110 --> 00:53:40.621
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>

2164
00:53:40.621 --> 00:53:42.420
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't like a smooth thing.</v>

2165
00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:45.390
<v Speaker 4>It was either writing or a very cool design.</v>

2166
00:53:45.450 --> 00:53:46.140
<v Speaker 4>I Dunno.</v>

2167
00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:48.960
<v Speaker 4>I mean I had no hope to read it or anything,</v>

2168
00:53:49.440 --> 00:53:50.340
<v Speaker 4>but so then it,</v>

2169
00:53:50.370 --> 00:53:53.370
<v Speaker 4>and then it starts shooting this light at me and this was one of the craziest</v>

2170
00:53:53.371 --> 00:53:53.670
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>

2171
00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:54.120
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

2172
00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:55.590
<v Speaker 4>as soon as the light comes,</v>

2173
00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:58.890
<v Speaker 4>I like lift my head up like this and open,</v>

2174
00:53:58.980 --> 00:53:59.410
<v Speaker 4>open,</v>

2175
00:53:59.410 --> 00:54:00.270
<v Speaker 4>like put the,</v>

2176
00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:04.080
<v Speaker 4>put my tongue on the roof of my mouth and the light starts coming in underneath</v>

2177
00:54:04.081 --> 00:54:04.914
<v Speaker 4>my Tom.</v>

2178
00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.210
<v Speaker 4>I don't know why I did.</v>

2179
00:54:06.211 --> 00:54:08.190
<v Speaker 4>I have no fucking clue why I did that.</v>

2180
00:54:08.191 --> 00:54:10.350
<v Speaker 4>But I did it and that's what I needed to do.</v>

2181
00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:11.670
<v Speaker 4>And I was just started doing it.</v>

2182
00:54:11.710 --> 00:54:13.650
<v Speaker 4>I was like breathing in this light.</v>

2183
00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:17.940
<v Speaker 4>It was like I was getting uploaded some kind of information again,</v>

2184
00:54:17.941 --> 00:54:19.290
<v Speaker 4>no physical sensation,</v>

2185
00:54:19.890 --> 00:54:20.723
<v Speaker 4>but I'm just,</v>

2186
00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:22.441
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2187
00:54:22.441 --> 00:54:23.640
<v Speaker 4>just breathing in,</v>

2188
00:54:23.970 --> 00:54:26.940
<v Speaker 4>breathing in this white light that's being uploaded into me.</v>

2189
00:54:27.210 --> 00:54:28.680
<v Speaker 4>And then I was like,</v>

2190
00:54:28.681 --> 00:54:29.040
<v Speaker 4>whoa,</v>

2191
00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:30.360
<v Speaker 4>this is fucking crazy.</v>

2192
00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:30.661
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2193
00:54:30.661 --> 00:54:34.600
<v Speaker 4>And I couldn't believe that I knew that that was what I was supposed to do and,</v>

2194
00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:35.453
<v Speaker 4>but I just did it.</v>

2195
00:54:35.610 --> 00:54:37.290
<v Speaker 4>And then the light stops,</v>

2196
00:54:37.291 --> 00:54:37.621
<v Speaker 4>boom,</v>

2197
00:54:37.621 --> 00:54:39.390
<v Speaker 4>retracts ship goes away.</v>

2198
00:54:39.780 --> 00:54:40.890
<v Speaker 4>And then that,</v>

2199
00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:42.030
<v Speaker 4>at that point,</v>

2200
00:54:42.570 --> 00:54:44.750
<v Speaker 4>everything just blew out like the,</v>

2201
00:54:44.751 --> 00:54:46.680
<v Speaker 4>I saw the room again and then the room just goes,</v>

2202
00:54:47.580 --> 00:54:51.600
<v Speaker 4>blows out into infinity and just complete infinity around me.</v>

2203
00:54:51.630 --> 00:54:53.520
<v Speaker 4>Now there's a couple things in infinity.</v>

2204
00:54:53.730 --> 00:54:56.130
<v Speaker 4>There's the Shaman who's like jutted out on a precipice,</v>

2205
00:54:56.131 --> 00:54:57.930
<v Speaker 4>who's going pretty hard with his he cross now.</v>

2206
00:54:58.290 --> 00:54:58.890
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2207
00:54:58.890 --> 00:55:00.300
<v Speaker 4>and then there's like some terraform.</v>

2208
00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:01.193
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't Halloween.</v>

2209
00:55:01.870 --> 00:55:02.703
<v Speaker 4>Oh Man,</v>

2210
00:55:02.910 --> 00:55:04.500
<v Speaker 4>if you listened to his video,</v>

2211
00:55:04.501 --> 00:55:04.950
<v Speaker 4>he's,</v>

2212
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:06.120
<v Speaker 4>he sings it a little bit.</v>

2213
00:55:06.121 --> 00:55:07.760
<v Speaker 4>But I wish I could get you something.</v>

2214
00:55:07.761 --> 00:55:08.460
<v Speaker 4>But it's</v>

2215
00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:13.030
<v Speaker 8>knee Jeannine and 18 nae nae,</v>

2216
00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:13.490
<v Speaker 8>nae,</v>

2217
00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:14.390
<v Speaker 8>Nae,</v>

2218
00:55:14.391 --> 00:55:15.480
<v Speaker 8>Nae Nae.</v>

2219
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:19.380
<v Speaker 4>Now the other words or is it just knows and sometimes there is some,</v>

2220
00:55:19.381 --> 00:55:22.170
<v Speaker 4>it's like I lost.</v>

2221
00:55:22.730 --> 00:55:23.300
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2222
00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:23.611
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2223
00:55:23.611 --> 00:55:25.110
<v Speaker 4>sometimes those things and things like that.</v>

2224
00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:28.420
<v Speaker 4>So that's kind of a flight.</v>

2225
00:55:28.421 --> 00:55:29.670
<v Speaker 4>Ravi said I have a terrible voice.</v>

2226
00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:30.930
<v Speaker 4>He didn't have a great voice either,</v>

2227
00:55:30.931 --> 00:55:32.160
<v Speaker 4>but it was powerful.</v>

2228
00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:32.641
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

2229
00:55:32.641 --> 00:55:33.750
<v Speaker 4>It's not like he was a singer,</v>

2230
00:55:34.530 --> 00:55:37.920
<v Speaker 4>it was just coming out and he was shaking is shaking his leaves.</v>

2231
00:55:37.921 --> 00:55:39.600
<v Speaker 4>But he's jotted up on this precipice.</v>

2232
00:55:39.870 --> 00:55:41.850
<v Speaker 4>And that was at three o'clock in my line of vision,</v>

2233
00:55:42.690 --> 00:55:46.980
<v Speaker 4>nine o'clock there some kind of terra forma and kind of universal stars and,</v>

2234
00:55:46.981 --> 00:55:48.240
<v Speaker 4>but it was like boom,</v>

2235
00:55:48.241 --> 00:55:49.200
<v Speaker 4>like everything,</v>

2236
00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:51.120
<v Speaker 4>everything else was completely gone.</v>

2237
00:55:51.121 --> 00:55:54.360
<v Speaker 4>Everything else I could see kind of vague outlines and white light.</v>

2238
00:55:54.510 --> 00:55:55.830
<v Speaker 4>You just got a software update.</v>

2239
00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:56.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2240
00:55:56.310 --> 00:55:56.940
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

2241
00:55:56.940 --> 00:55:57.960
<v Speaker 4>But this is the fucking,</v>

2242
00:55:57.961 --> 00:55:59.520
<v Speaker 4>this is another crazy factor.</v>

2243
00:55:59.550 --> 00:56:01.710
<v Speaker 4>I would turn my head to the left,</v>

2244
00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:01.921
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2245
00:56:01.921 --> 00:56:05.940
<v Speaker 4>turned my head 90 degrees and still the Shamans at three o'clock,</v>

2246
00:56:06.090 --> 00:56:07.440
<v Speaker 4>the terraform is at nine o'clock.</v>

2247
00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:09.750
<v Speaker 4>It did not matter which way I turned my head.</v>

2248
00:56:09.751 --> 00:56:10.680
<v Speaker 4>I could lie down,</v>

2249
00:56:10.800 --> 00:56:11.611
<v Speaker 4>I could go left,</v>

2250
00:56:11.611 --> 00:56:12.480
<v Speaker 4>I could go right.</v>

2251
00:56:12.780 --> 00:56:13.441
<v Speaker 4>Didn't matter.</v>

2252
00:56:13.441 --> 00:56:16.410
<v Speaker 4>My vision was stuck in the same spot.</v>

2253
00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:21.330
<v Speaker 4>It's like any movements I made in the third dimension had absolutely no impact</v>

2254
00:56:21.570 --> 00:56:23.560
<v Speaker 4>of what I was seeing in the eight dimension.</v>

2255
00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:25.660
<v Speaker 4>Like I guess if I wanted to look around in that dimension,</v>

2256
00:56:25.920 --> 00:56:27.010
<v Speaker 4>why is it the eighth time?</v>

2257
00:56:27.011 --> 00:56:27.761
<v Speaker 4>So I'll get to that.</v>

2258
00:56:27.761 --> 00:56:28.390
<v Speaker 4>Sorry about that.</v>

2259
00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:28.931
<v Speaker 4>But that's,</v>

2260
00:56:28.931 --> 00:56:29.440
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

2261
00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:31.400
<v Speaker 4>that was what I encountered in,</v>

2262
00:56:31.401 --> 00:56:31.720
<v Speaker 4>so that's,</v>

2263
00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:34.600
<v Speaker 4>that's the paradigm they used at the end of it.</v>

2264
00:56:34.630 --> 00:56:35.463
<v Speaker 4>They call,</v>

2265
00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:36.040
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2266
00:56:36.040 --> 00:56:37.780
<v Speaker 4>they call where I was at that point,</v>

2267
00:56:37.781 --> 00:56:38.520
<v Speaker 4>the eighth dimension.</v>

2268
00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:38.691
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

2269
00:56:38.691 --> 00:56:40.000
<v Speaker 4>and the reason why is,</v>

2270
00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:41.050
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2271
00:56:41.050 --> 00:56:42.940
<v Speaker 4>that's the penultimate dimension.</v>

2272
00:56:42.941 --> 00:56:44.440
<v Speaker 4>That's the last one before the ninth,</v>

2273
00:56:44.441 --> 00:56:46.360
<v Speaker 4>which is oneness with all creation,</v>

2274
00:56:46.420 --> 00:56:47.253
<v Speaker 4>which is just,</v>

2275
00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:48.070
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2276
00:56:48.070 --> 00:56:49.160
<v Speaker 4>unification with,</v>

2277
00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:49.991
<v Speaker 4>with all life,</v>

2278
00:56:49.991 --> 00:56:51.280
<v Speaker 4>all creation that ever was,</v>

2279
00:56:51.281 --> 00:56:54.550
<v Speaker 4>that ever will be pure solidarity with,</v>

2280
00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:54.730
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2281
00:56:54.730 --> 00:56:55.090
<v Speaker 4>with,</v>

2282
00:56:55.090 --> 00:56:55.631
<v Speaker 4>with God,</v>

2283
00:56:55.631 --> 00:56:56.141
<v Speaker 4>with the universe,</v>

2284
00:56:56.141 --> 00:56:56.340
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

2285
00:56:56.340 --> 00:56:59.520
<v Speaker 1>Is that supposed to be what you're hitting when he blows the cinnamon smoke now.</v>

2286
00:56:59.610 --> 00:57:02.370
<v Speaker 4>So that was actually the seventh dimension is what they were going,</v>

2287
00:57:02.390 --> 00:57:03.690
<v Speaker 4>but to go back to where I,</v>

2288
00:57:03.691 --> 00:57:04.350
<v Speaker 4>where I was,</v>

2289
00:57:04.350 --> 00:57:04.921
<v Speaker 4>where I was there,</v>

2290
00:57:04.921 --> 00:57:06.760
<v Speaker 4>and I'll explain that the paradigm as they see,</v>

2291
00:57:06.770 --> 00:57:09.680
<v Speaker 4>they give you a map of each question they do afterwards,</v>

2292
00:57:09.681 --> 00:57:11.010
<v Speaker 4>tourists good afterwards.</v>

2293
00:57:11.310 --> 00:57:11.701
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2294
00:57:11.701 --> 00:57:12.330
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2295
00:57:12.330 --> 00:57:12.751
<v Speaker 4>so yeah,</v>

2296
00:57:12.751 --> 00:57:13.500
<v Speaker 4>so at that,</v>

2297
00:57:13.500 --> 00:57:14.011
<v Speaker 4>at that point,</v>

2298
00:57:14.011 --> 00:57:15.090
<v Speaker 4>no visions were coming.</v>

2299
00:57:15.091 --> 00:57:18.060
<v Speaker 4>Nothing was happening to me at all and I was completely lucid.</v>

2300
00:57:18.330 --> 00:57:18.930
<v Speaker 4>So I was like,</v>

2301
00:57:18.930 --> 00:57:19.410
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

2302
00:57:19.410 --> 00:57:20.243
<v Speaker 4>what can I do?</v>

2303
00:57:20.490 --> 00:57:21.301
<v Speaker 4>And I was thinking like,</v>

2304
00:57:21.301 --> 00:57:21.481
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2305
00:57:21.481 --> 00:57:22.231
<v Speaker 4>what would I want to do?</v>

2306
00:57:22.231 --> 00:57:22.501
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2307
00:57:22.501 --> 00:57:23.190
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

2308
00:57:23.190 --> 00:57:24.870
<v Speaker 4>I got a friend who got in a car wreck.</v>

2309
00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:25.261
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2310
00:57:25.261 --> 00:57:27.090
<v Speaker 4>I wonder how he's doing and he's in Atlanta.</v>

2311
00:57:27.450 --> 00:57:28.283
<v Speaker 4>And so I was like,</v>

2312
00:57:28.300 --> 00:57:29.070
<v Speaker 4>wonder how he's doing?</v>

2313
00:57:29.070 --> 00:57:29.520
<v Speaker 4>Boom.</v>

2314
00:57:29.520 --> 00:57:32.220
<v Speaker 4>I see him and he's in like a bar or restaurant and I'm like,</v>

2315
00:57:32.250 --> 00:57:33.083
<v Speaker 4>Oh snap.</v>

2316
00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:34.470
<v Speaker 4>Like he just came immediately.</v>

2317
00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:35.820
<v Speaker 4>It didn't have to travel.</v>

2318
00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:37.110
<v Speaker 4>Like I could see it right there.</v>

2319
00:57:37.111 --> 00:57:37.670
<v Speaker 4>And he's laughing,</v>

2320
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:38.503
<v Speaker 4>talking with friends.</v>

2321
00:57:38.730 --> 00:57:39.420
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2322
00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:40.560
<v Speaker 4>well it looks like he's okay,</v>

2323
00:57:40.561 --> 00:57:41.610
<v Speaker 4>but I wonder if he really is.</v>

2324
00:57:41.880 --> 00:57:46.320
<v Speaker 4>And I was able to like look in his body and I see this like bad energetic,</v>

2325
00:57:46.350 --> 00:57:49.710
<v Speaker 4>something like this black part of in his rib cage.</v>

2326
00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:50.880
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

2327
00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:51.380
<v Speaker 4>oh that's,</v>

2328
00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:52.213
<v Speaker 4>that's no good.</v>

2329
00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:53.040
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

2330
00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:54.210
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if I can get rid of that.</v>

2331
00:57:54.570 --> 00:57:55.403
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

2332
00:57:56.010 --> 00:57:58.230
<v Speaker 4>then I focused on pushing like white,</v>

2333
00:57:58.350 --> 00:58:00.870
<v Speaker 4>that golden light into his body and I was like,</v>

2334
00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:04.380
<v Speaker 4>Bill's his body and pushes this little missile out of his ribs.</v>

2335
00:58:04.381 --> 00:58:05.010
<v Speaker 4>And I was like,</v>

2336
00:58:05.010 --> 00:58:06.030
<v Speaker 4>Oh shit.</v>

2337
00:58:06.270 --> 00:58:08.100
<v Speaker 4>Like I don't know if that actually helped them,</v>

2338
00:58:08.101 --> 00:58:09.870
<v Speaker 4>but that was pretty rad that I was able to do it.</v>

2339
00:58:09.871 --> 00:58:10.260
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>

2340
00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:12.690
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know I got to call him up afterwards.</v>

2341
00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:13.561
<v Speaker 4>I couldn't call.</v>

2342
00:58:13.561 --> 00:58:14.041
<v Speaker 4>There's no,</v>

2343
00:58:14.041 --> 00:58:15.690
<v Speaker 4>there's no cell phone talking to him later.</v>

2344
00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:16.861
<v Speaker 4>I talked to him later.</v>

2345
00:58:16.861 --> 00:58:19.140
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't remember like the exact moment,</v>

2346
00:58:19.141 --> 00:58:20.430
<v Speaker 4>but he said right around then.</v>

2347
00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:20.811
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2348
00:58:20.811 --> 00:58:22.380
<v Speaker 4>he started feeling way better,</v>

2349
00:58:22.860 --> 00:58:23.101
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2350
00:58:23.101 --> 00:58:23.934
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

2351
00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:24.300
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2352
00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:24.870
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

2353
00:58:24.870 --> 00:58:26.120
<v Speaker 4>Then before that I just,</v>

2354
00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:26.431
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2355
00:58:26.431 --> 00:58:26.701
<v Speaker 4>he had,</v>

2356
00:58:26.701 --> 00:58:27.600
<v Speaker 4>he had a bad impact,</v>

2357
00:58:27.601 --> 00:58:29.520
<v Speaker 4>got t bone with some lady coming off the,</v>

2358
00:58:29.521 --> 00:58:30.331
<v Speaker 4>off the freeway,</v>

2359
00:58:30.331 --> 00:58:31.350
<v Speaker 4>hit the steering wheel,</v>

2360
00:58:31.351 --> 00:58:31.880
<v Speaker 4>hit his head.</v>

2361
00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:35.030
<v Speaker 1>So he felt better out of nowhere.</v>

2362
00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:36.140
<v Speaker 1>Did you ask him,</v>

2363
00:58:36.141 --> 00:58:36.621
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

2364
00:58:36.621 --> 00:58:38.720
<v Speaker 1>do you ever been in a bar and then all of a sudden you feel better?</v>

2365
00:58:38.930 --> 00:58:39.621
<v Speaker 1>Or did you say,</v>

2366
00:58:39.621 --> 00:58:39.921
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2367
00:58:39.921 --> 00:58:42.050
<v Speaker 1>I did some food freaky Voodoo on you?</v>

2368
00:58:42.290 --> 00:58:45.150
<v Speaker 1>Did you put the power of suggestion and it's fine when you,</v>

2369
00:58:45.170 --> 00:58:45.780
<v Speaker 1>sadly,</v>

2370
00:58:45.780 --> 00:58:46.770
<v Speaker 4>next time I talked to him,</v>

2371
00:58:46.771 --> 00:58:48.300
<v Speaker 4>I was fucking hammered.</v>

2372
00:58:48.301 --> 00:58:50.140
<v Speaker 4>So I think we just got right into it.</v>

2373
00:58:50.190 --> 00:58:53.010
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't like you got to dance around that one.</v>

2374
00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Find out the real evidence.</v>

2375
00:58:54.541 --> 00:58:54.781
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2376
00:58:54.781 --> 00:58:55.120
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2377
00:58:55.120 --> 00:58:55.481
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2378
00:58:55.481 --> 00:58:55.900
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2379
00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:56.620
<v Speaker 4>next time,</v>

2380
00:58:56.620 --> 00:58:57.550
<v Speaker 4>next time I'll do that.</v>

2381
00:58:57.551 --> 00:58:57.941
<v Speaker 4>But we,</v>

2382
00:58:57.941 --> 00:58:58.151
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2383
00:58:58.151 --> 00:59:00.100
<v Speaker 4>he just breezed into town and I was like,</v>

2384
00:59:00.110 --> 00:59:00.611
<v Speaker 4>Yo,</v>

2385
00:59:00.611 --> 00:59:01.990
<v Speaker 4>I'm just back from Peru.</v>

2386
00:59:02.310 --> 00:59:02.680
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2387
00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:03.111
<v Speaker 4>but anyway,</v>

2388
00:59:03.111 --> 00:59:03.340
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

2389
00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:05.830
<v Speaker 4>so I didn't get the proper scientific explanation,</v>

2390
00:59:05.831 --> 00:59:08.350
<v Speaker 4>but some loose correlation with how it works.</v>

2391
00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:08.980
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2392
00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:11.530
<v Speaker 4>But more concrete evidence on myself.</v>

2393
00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:12.160
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2394
00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:12.551
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2395
00:59:12.551 --> 00:59:12.761
<v Speaker 4>all right,</v>

2396
00:59:12.761 --> 00:59:13.840
<v Speaker 4>well if I do that to him,</v>

2397
00:59:13.841 --> 00:59:14.674
<v Speaker 4>what about myself?</v>

2398
00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:17.020
<v Speaker 4>And I started scanning my body with my,</v>

2399
00:59:17.110 --> 00:59:21.560
<v Speaker 4>with my hands and my mind and it was like a car mechanic looking at the car,</v>

2400
00:59:21.561 --> 00:59:23.330
<v Speaker 4>like I was completely detached from and I was like,</v>

2401
00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:24.530
<v Speaker 4>oh that's pretty good.</v>

2402
00:59:24.531 --> 00:59:26.000
<v Speaker 4>Like I did a pretty good job here.</v>

2403
00:59:26.001 --> 00:59:26.870
<v Speaker 4>Like that's not bad.</v>

2404
00:59:26.871 --> 00:59:28.070
<v Speaker 4>Like this vessel is pretty good.</v>

2405
00:59:28.370 --> 00:59:31.260
<v Speaker 4>And I was just giving it like a 10 point inspection and you know,</v>

2406
00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:32.780
<v Speaker 4>my glands that have always been swollen,</v>

2407
00:59:32.781 --> 00:59:33.110
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2408
00:59:33.110 --> 00:59:33.411
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

2409
00:59:33.411 --> 00:59:35.330
<v Speaker 4>there's something not quite right there.</v>

2410
00:59:35.660 --> 00:59:39.920
<v Speaker 4>So I like went and I like physically like started pulling out of out of my</v>

2411
00:59:39.921 --> 00:59:40.261
<v Speaker 4>glands.</v>

2412
00:59:40.261 --> 00:59:40.491
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

2413
00:59:40.491 --> 00:59:42.440
<v Speaker 4>well maybe I can pull what's bad out of there.</v>

2414
00:59:42.800 --> 00:59:46.880
<v Speaker 4>And I felt like I did and I felt like it stuck to my fingers and my shaking my</v>

2415
00:59:46.881 --> 00:59:47.360
<v Speaker 4>fingers like,</v>

2416
00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:47.720
<v Speaker 4>ah,</v>

2417
00:59:47.720 --> 00:59:48.261
<v Speaker 4>get it off.</v>

2418
00:59:48.261 --> 00:59:49.190
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know how to get it off.</v>

2419
00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:53.630
<v Speaker 4>So I like shake it and some of it falls off and then I put it in the ground and</v>

2420
00:59:53.631 --> 00:59:54.750
<v Speaker 4>some of it like drips off.</v>

2421
00:59:54.770 --> 00:59:55.161
<v Speaker 4>And then I was like,</v>

2422
00:59:55.161 --> 00:59:55.281
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2423
00:59:55.281 --> 00:59:56.210
<v Speaker 4>it's still not working.</v>

2424
00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:59.780
<v Speaker 4>So I had a water then and I poured it on my fingers and that seemed to work.</v>

2425
01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:00.710
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2426
01:00:00.710 --> 01:00:01.100
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2427
01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:01.641
<v Speaker 4>who knows,</v>

2428
01:00:01.641 --> 01:00:02.391
<v Speaker 4>who knows about that.</v>

2429
01:00:02.391 --> 01:00:04.700
<v Speaker 4>But since then I haven't gotten,</v>

2430
01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:09.080
<v Speaker 4>my glands have not been swollen at all and I've gotten like Epstein Barr virus</v>

2431
01:00:09.081 --> 01:00:11.360
<v Speaker 4>that always like has him a little bit swollen,</v>

2432
01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:13.400
<v Speaker 4>but not even a bit since then.</v>

2433
01:00:13.430 --> 01:00:14.600
<v Speaker 4>So I dunno</v>

2434
01:00:14.730 --> 01:00:14.911
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

2435
01:00:14.911 --> 01:00:15.210
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

2436
01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:18.140
<v Speaker 3>thank God you weren't just ripping your face off at that time by the way.</v>

2437
01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:19.850
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

2438
01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:21.090
<v Speaker 3>I was so lucid,</v>

2439
01:00:21.091 --> 01:00:22.250
<v Speaker 3>like anything I thought.</v>

2440
01:00:22.410 --> 01:00:22.831
<v Speaker 3>And then I was like,</v>

2441
01:00:22.831 --> 01:00:23.820
<v Speaker 3>well what am I listening to?</v>

2442
01:00:23.821 --> 01:00:24.654
<v Speaker 3>What you just said?</v>

2443
01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:28.560
<v Speaker 3>You said I was so lucid my glands out.</v>

2444
01:00:28.561 --> 01:00:28.731
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2445
01:00:28.731 --> 01:00:29.720
<v Speaker 3>I was ripping my glands.</v>

2446
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:31.050
<v Speaker 3>Now we're dirt.</v>

2447
01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:31.591
<v Speaker 3>It's weird,</v>

2448
01:00:31.591 --> 01:00:32.280
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2449
01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:35.780
<v Speaker 3>Shooting long missiles out of your friend when you hear us</v>

2450
01:00:35.820 --> 01:00:37.020

2452

2453
01:00:40.590 --> 01:00:42.330
<v Speaker 1>Someone's got their phone right next to the thing</v>

01:00:49.410 --> 01:00:49.800
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

<v Speaker 1>when you hear yourself saying this knee's hear yourself describing it,</v>

2461
01:00:52.981 --> 01:00:54.390
<v Speaker 1>it's surely part of,</v>

2462
01:00:54.391 --> 01:00:57.720
<v Speaker 1>you must think how preposterous and ridiculous.</v>

2463
01:00:57.721 --> 01:00:59.460
<v Speaker 1>This must sound to a skeptical person.</v>

2464
01:00:59.480 --> 01:00:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

2465

<v Speaker 1>That's how you find yourself.</v>

2481
01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:16.111
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

01:01:18.631 --> 01:01:19.464
<v Speaker 1>this is like,</v>

2487
01:01:19.470 --> 01:01:22.860
<v Speaker 1>this is like the main thing that people would criticize.</v>

2488
01:01:23.190 --> 01:01:23.491
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2489
01:01:23.491 --> 01:01:26.580
<v Speaker 1>if they would hear about people trying to find themselves with drugs.</v>

2490
01:01:26.581 --> 01:01:26.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2491
01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:29.820
<v Speaker 1>This fucking idiot thinks he's pulling cancer out of it.</v>

2492
01:01:30.080 --> 01:01:30.913
<v Speaker 3>Blends.</v>

2493
01:01:31.010 --> 01:01:31.281
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2494
01:01:31.281 --> 01:01:31.640
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2495
01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:32.150
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>

2496
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:32.871
<v Speaker 3>you hear that,</v>

2497
01:01:32.871 --> 01:01:33.704
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>

2498
01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:36.500
<v Speaker 3>But you can control your mind if you're,</v>

2499
01:01:36.501 --> 01:01:38.810
<v Speaker 3>if you are what your mind believes it is,</v>

2500
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:39.201
<v Speaker 3>then he,</v>

2501
01:01:39.201 --> 01:01:40.250
<v Speaker 3>if he thinks he's a,</v>

2502
01:01:40.251 --> 01:01:41.630
<v Speaker 3>he's cleaning out his body,</v>

2503
01:01:41.631 --> 01:01:44.990
<v Speaker 3>his brain will think he's cleaning out his body and it might actually have</v>

2504
01:01:44.991 --> 01:01:45.681
<v Speaker 3>something to it,</v>

2505
01:01:45.681 --> 01:01:46.370
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2506
01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:47.203
<v Speaker 3>like</v>

2507
01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:48.950
<v Speaker 3>actually happening.</v>

2508
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:49.400
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2509
01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:50.900
<v Speaker 3>either way more it's actually happening,</v>

2510
01:01:50.901 --> 01:01:51.051
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

2511
01:01:51.051 --> 01:01:51.770
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2512
01:01:51.770 --> 01:01:53.540
<v Speaker 3>I was there and I have to report it.</v>

2513
01:01:53.680 --> 01:01:54.513
<v Speaker 3>Honestly,</v>

2514
01:01:54.650 --> 01:01:55.660
<v Speaker 3>I feel like that's my,</v>

2515
01:01:55.770 --> 01:01:58.410
<v Speaker 4>that's my mission to come back and I feel like it's one of the reasons why it</v>

2516
01:01:58.411 --> 01:02:00.570
<v Speaker 4>happened to me so I could talk about it and,</v>

2517
01:02:00.571 --> 01:02:00.751
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2518
01:02:00.751 --> 01:02:01.950
<v Speaker 4>talking to you guys and get,</v>

2519
01:02:01.980 --> 01:02:02.790
<v Speaker 4>get it out there.</v>

2520
01:02:02.790 --> 01:02:04.440
<v Speaker 4>But the next thing I did was,</v>

2521
01:02:04.441 --> 01:02:04.980
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2522
01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:09.090
<v Speaker 4>was I looked at my business and very lucidly looked at all of my marketing</v>

2523
01:02:09.091 --> 01:02:10.260
<v Speaker 4>channels and different things.</v>

2524
01:02:10.410 --> 01:02:10.920
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

2525
01:02:10.920 --> 01:02:11.970
<v Speaker 4>thought about Alpha brain,</v>

2526
01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.020
<v Speaker 4>thought about the different things,</v>

2527
01:02:13.021 --> 01:02:13.854
<v Speaker 4>thought about,</v>

2528
01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:14.191
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2529
01:02:14.191 --> 01:02:14.970
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

2530
01:02:14.970 --> 01:02:19.970
<v Speaker 4>very conservative Republican type thinking about my life and my business.</v>

2531
01:02:20.251 --> 01:02:23.490
<v Speaker 4>And I'd saw some channels that I was working hard to produce and I was like,</v>

2532
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:24.750
<v Speaker 4>there's no resources there.</v>

2533
01:02:24.751 --> 01:02:26.700
<v Speaker 4>And I could v physically visualize,</v>

2534
01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:27.151
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2535
01:02:27.151 --> 01:02:30.750
<v Speaker 4>where there was pools in these tubes that were feeding like a giant machine.</v>

2536
01:02:30.751 --> 01:02:31.350
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2537
01:02:31.350 --> 01:02:34.230
<v Speaker 4>well I'm trying to build this tube to this pool of resources,</v>

2538
01:02:34.231 --> 01:02:35.130
<v Speaker 4>but there's nothing there.</v>

2539
01:02:35.220 --> 01:02:36.450
<v Speaker 4>Like I got to cut that one off.</v>

2540
01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:36.871
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2541
01:02:36.871 --> 01:02:38.610
<v Speaker 4>this one is good but it's blocked.</v>

2542
01:02:38.611 --> 01:02:38.791
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2543
01:02:38.791 --> 01:02:39.690
<v Speaker 4>they've got to change that,</v>

2544
01:02:39.691 --> 01:02:40.530
<v Speaker 4>change the marketing,</v>

2545
01:02:40.740 --> 01:02:40.921
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2546
01:02:40.921 --> 01:02:42.030
<v Speaker 4>change something on that.</v>

2547
01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:43.170
<v Speaker 4>So or you know,</v>

2548
01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:47.690
<v Speaker 4>think about this formula or that and I could visualize it perfectly and you</v>

2549
01:02:47.691 --> 01:02:48.330
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

2550
01:02:48.330 --> 01:02:50.190
<v Speaker 4>right now business is going great.</v>

2551
01:02:50.191 --> 01:02:50.450
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>

2552
01:02:50.450 --> 01:02:51.980
<v Speaker 1>so you saw it it and metaphors.</v>

2553
01:02:51.981 --> 01:02:56.090
<v Speaker 1>You saw it in a different sense than you saw it as you know,</v>

2554
01:02:56.091 --> 01:02:56.630
<v Speaker 1>here's,</v>

2555
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:57.710
<v Speaker 1>here's a product,</v>

2556
01:02:57.711 --> 01:02:58.640
<v Speaker 1>here's the marketing.</v>

2557
01:02:58.641 --> 01:03:02.000
<v Speaker 1>Instead of that you saw it as almost like energy or</v>

2558
01:03:02.250 --> 01:03:02.681
<v Speaker 4>thank feet.</v>

2559
01:03:02.681 --> 01:03:03.670
<v Speaker 4>It was like feeding,</v>

2560
01:03:03.700 --> 01:03:05.620
<v Speaker 4>it was like feeding a machine like gas,</v>

2561
01:03:05.621 --> 01:03:06.270
<v Speaker 4>fuel.</v>

2562
01:03:06.270 --> 01:03:06.870

01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:09.330
<v Speaker 3>Did you talk to it like the other people?</v>

2565

<v Speaker 3>the dancing</v>

2567
01:03:13.750 --> 01:03:15.160
<v Speaker 1>phone is so much louder than everybody else's.</v>

2568
01:03:15.161 --> 01:03:16.300
<v Speaker 1>You suck on that thing,</v>

2569
01:03:16.301 --> 01:03:16.511

2571
01:03:18.370 --> 01:03:19.260
<v Speaker 1>back off a little bit.</v>

2572
01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:19.990
<v Speaker 1>Everybody,</v>

2573
01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:20.370
<v Speaker 1>everybody else</v>

2574
01:03:20.370 --> 01:03:24.570
<v Speaker 3>so whereas other people like like just like seeing dancing bears.</v>

2575
01:03:24.571 --> 01:03:24.700
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2576
01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:25.533
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

2577
01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:26.553
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2578
01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:31.440
<v Speaker 4>they were seeing their own demons or spirits or are different things.</v>

2579
01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:33.170
<v Speaker 1>Did you guys have shared visions?</v>

2580
01:03:33.290 --> 01:03:33.890
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2581
01:03:33.890 --> 01:03:34.790
<v Speaker 1>No shared vision.</v>

2582
01:03:34.970 --> 01:03:35.803
<v Speaker 1>No shared visits.</v>

2583
01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:40.070
<v Speaker 1>That's one of the things that when they first discovered it,</v>

2584
01:03:40.340 --> 01:03:41.060
<v Speaker 1>the the,</v>

2585
01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:43.490
<v Speaker 1>when they started bringing it back to the Western world,</v>

2586
01:03:43.491 --> 01:03:45.370
<v Speaker 1>they tried to call it telepathy mean.</v>

2587
01:03:46.050 --> 01:03:46.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2588
01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:47.053
<v Speaker 1>because?</v>

2589
01:03:47.150 --> 01:03:49.070
<v Speaker 1>Because of shared experiences,</v>

2590
01:03:49.071 --> 01:03:54.071
<v Speaker 1>but because of the rules of a scientific rules of nomenclature because the</v>

2591
01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:55.131
<v Speaker 1>isolated,</v>

2592
01:03:55.131 --> 01:03:56.990
<v Speaker 1>the compound is harming already.</v>

2593
01:03:56.991 --> 01:04:01.010
<v Speaker 1>One of the compounds they went with that because it was the first description of</v>

2594
01:04:01.011 --> 01:04:01.101
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2595
01:04:01.101 --> 01:04:04.310
<v Speaker 1>but they were going to call it telepathy dean because of the shared experiences,</v>

2596
01:04:04.311 --> 01:04:05.810
<v Speaker 1>but you didn't have any of that.</v>

2597
01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:10.400
<v Speaker 4>There was some like husband and wife couples in different huts that did that</v>

2598
01:04:10.401 --> 01:04:11.121
<v Speaker 4>we're witnessing.</v>

2599
01:04:11.121 --> 01:04:13.430
<v Speaker 4>One would just witnessed the others entire experience.</v>

2600
01:04:13.431 --> 01:04:15.910
<v Speaker 4>It'd be like they would try and talk to each other about it and in fact,</v>

2601
01:04:15.911 --> 01:04:16.071
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

2602
01:04:16.071 --> 01:04:17.150
<v Speaker 4>I know I saw the whole thing.</v>

2603
01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:18.140
<v Speaker 4>So that happened.</v>

2604
01:04:18.170 --> 01:04:20.270
<v Speaker 4>But as far as like the group in my setting,</v>

2605
01:04:20.810 --> 01:04:23.350
<v Speaker 4>it seemed to be more closely linked to um,</v>

2606
01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:24.433
<v Speaker 4>family,</v>

2607
01:04:24.530 --> 01:04:24.771
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2608
01:04:24.771 --> 01:04:27.200
<v Speaker 4>family ties or relationship,</v>

2609
01:04:27.201 --> 01:04:28.100
<v Speaker 4>romantic ties,</v>

2610
01:04:28.101 --> 01:04:28.790
<v Speaker 4>things like that.</v>

2611
01:04:28.790 --> 01:04:29.870
<v Speaker 4>Not necessarily what,</v>

2612
01:04:30.250 --> 01:04:33.790
<v Speaker 1>so the shared experiences are with people that already have a relationship.</v>

2613
01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:35.380
<v Speaker 4>That's what seemed to be happening in this.</v>

2614
01:04:35.570 --> 01:04:36.350
<v Speaker 1>That makes sense.</v>

2615
01:04:36.350 --> 01:04:36.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2616
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:37.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2617
01:04:37.191 --> 01:04:38.450
<v Speaker 1>You were already tuned in together.</v>

2618
01:04:38.451 --> 01:04:39.231
<v Speaker 1>You're already well,</v>

2619
01:04:39.231 --> 01:04:39.501
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2620
01:04:39.501 --> 01:04:42.950
<v Speaker 1>there's that feeling always when you're in a relationship that you become a part</v>

2621
01:04:42.951 --> 01:04:43.784
<v Speaker 1>of that person.</v>

2622
01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:44.361
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2623
01:04:44.361 --> 01:04:45.194
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2624
01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:48.650
<v Speaker 1>I think every deep intense relationships that I've ever had,</v>

2625
01:04:48.890 --> 01:04:52.880
<v Speaker 1>you feel like it's more than just two people hanging out together.</v>

2626
01:04:52.970 --> 01:04:53.990
<v Speaker 1>Somehow or another,</v>

2627
01:04:53.991 --> 01:04:55.700
<v Speaker 1>you connect on some,</v>

2628
01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:58.250
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to say spiritual energy,</v>

2629
01:04:58.251 --> 01:05:00.170
<v Speaker 1>so some sort of intangible level,</v>

2630
01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:04.550
<v Speaker 1>which is why breaking up is so painful because a part of you is literally</v>

2631
01:05:04.551 --> 01:05:04.941
<v Speaker 1>missing.</v>

2632
01:05:04.941 --> 01:05:06.380
<v Speaker 1>You cannot feel whole.</v>

2633
01:05:06.650 --> 01:05:07.550
<v Speaker 1>You can't sleep,</v>

2634
01:05:07.551 --> 01:05:08.181
<v Speaker 1>you can't eat,</v>

2635
01:05:08.181 --> 01:05:10.940
<v Speaker 1>you don't feel right because some of you is missing.</v>

2636
01:05:11.210 --> 01:05:14.300
<v Speaker 1>So that would kind of make sense that those are the type of people that would</v>

2637
01:05:14.301 --> 01:05:17.090
<v Speaker 1>have a shared experience because they literally have,</v>

2638
01:05:17.350 --> 01:05:18.010
<v Speaker 1>their souls</v>

2639
01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:19.450
<v Speaker 5>are somehow or another connected.</v>

2640
01:05:19.451 --> 01:05:22.030
<v Speaker 5>They have some sort of a inexorable bond.</v>

2641
01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:23.141
<v Speaker 5>And that's,</v>

2642
01:05:23.141 --> 01:05:23.770
<v Speaker 5>and that's what,</v>

2643
01:05:23.770 --> 01:05:24.940
<v Speaker 5>that's what played itself out.</v>

2644
01:05:25.030 --> 01:05:27.580
<v Speaker 5>So you didn't have any experiences with your mom.</v>

2645
01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:29.020
<v Speaker 5>Your mom only did it once.</v>

2646
01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:30.130
<v Speaker 5>Now she did it three times.</v>

2647
01:05:30.131 --> 01:05:30.964
<v Speaker 5>She did it three times,</v>

2648
01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:31.541
<v Speaker 5>three times.</v>

2649
01:05:31.541 --> 01:05:32.201
<v Speaker 5>She do it with you,</v>

2650
01:05:32.201 --> 01:05:32.751
<v Speaker 5>with the Dragon.</v>

2651
01:05:32.751 --> 01:05:35.500
<v Speaker 5>And she was actually in that room that time and she said she was,</v>

2652
01:05:35.501 --> 01:05:36.790
<v Speaker 5>she didn't see what I saw.</v>

2653
01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:37.091
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2654
01:05:37.091 --> 01:05:38.100
<v Speaker 5>it wasn't because it.</v>
