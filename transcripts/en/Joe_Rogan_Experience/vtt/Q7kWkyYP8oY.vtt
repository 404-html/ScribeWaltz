<v Speaker 1>You guys got to walk in the right</v>

54
00:02:21.801 --> 00:02:22.250
<v Speaker 1>places.</v>

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.810
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the Jersey shore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

56
00:02:23.811 --> 00:02:26.480
<v Speaker 1>There wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Dad lives in Florida on the treasure</v>

57
00:02:26.481 --> 00:02:27.231
<v Speaker 1>coast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they call it,</v>

58
00:02:27.231 --> 00:02:30.360
<v Speaker 1>which is like the Atlantic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mid Atlantic or mid halfway up and down</v>

59
00:02:30.361 --> 00:02:32.300
<v Speaker 1>in Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like every time it's hurricanes too.</v>

60
00:02:32.301 --> 00:02:35.000
<v Speaker 1>People are always out on the beach</v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for stuff because shit gets</v>

61
00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.820
<v Speaker 1>to treasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chests are train wrecks,</v>

62
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.750
<v Speaker 1>like in the Bermuda Triangle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I like the pirate treasure gets wiped</v>

63
00:02:41.751 --> 00:02:44.630
<v Speaker 1>up onto the beach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something about finding that</v>

64
00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:46.760
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you went to a museum and you saw</v>

65
00:02:46.761 --> 00:02:50.090
<v Speaker 1>a ring from the ninth century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 10th century,</v>

66
00:02:50.091 --> 00:02:51.620
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd probably be like,</v>

67
00:02:51.621 --> 00:02:53.360
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's incredible.</v>

68
00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:54.194
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

69
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.250
<v Speaker 1>But if you fucking founded in the dirt</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you picked it up and it may be</v>

70
00:02:58.251 --> 00:02:59.540
<v Speaker 1>likely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's,</v>

71
00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>there's at</v>

72
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.320
<v Speaker 4>least a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The last person that touched it was the</v>

73
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:04.060
<v Speaker 4>person that died there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huge,</v>

74
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.030
<v Speaker 4>huge possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huge.</v>

75
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.960
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's.</v>

76
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.450
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how great would that.</v>

77
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.760
<v Speaker 4>The feeling would have been amazing fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Find a fossil.</v>

78
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.960
<v Speaker 4>You ever find a fossil when you were a</v>
<v Speaker 4>kid walking around?</v>

79
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.940
<v Speaker 4>Not really a felon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Arrowhead though.</v>

80
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.510
<v Speaker 4>That's important to you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Excited is.</v>

81
00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.490
<v Speaker 4>It was in Nevada.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bowhunting.</v>

82
00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.940
<v Speaker 4>I found an arrowhead and I lost it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

83
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.570
<v Speaker 4>that's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Think you're actually supposed to leave</v>

84
00:03:28.571 --> 00:03:30.970
<v Speaker 4>them there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's probably Karma for them.</v>

85
00:03:30.971 --> 00:03:32.830
<v Speaker 4>Like leaving here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a trail.</v>

86
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:33.880
<v Speaker 4>Anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gonna find it.</v>

87
00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:36.000
<v Speaker 4>This is stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you want me to bring it to me,</v>

88
00:03:36.001 --> 00:03:37.420
<v Speaker 4>his hair or something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's one thing.</v>

89
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.430
<v Speaker 4>But just say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just leave it there for.</v>

90
00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.380
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone else is going to become taken.</v>

91
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:42.710
<v Speaker 4>No one's going to leave it there.</v>

92
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.260
<v Speaker 5>Story of my brother in law who uses</v>
<v Speaker 5>metal detector and his,</v>

93
00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.670
<v Speaker 5>his uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>friends married couple I think newly</v>

94
00:03:54.671 --> 00:03:58.000
<v Speaker 5>married when hiking in the grand tetons</v>
<v Speaker 5>and she lost her ring.</v>

95
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:03.180
<v Speaker 5>She lost her engagement ring and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was going out there like in a month</v>

96
00:04:04.451 --> 00:04:08.110
<v Speaker 5>from then and he went out and he took</v>
<v Speaker 5>his metal detector here and he hiked</v>

97
00:04:08.111 --> 00:04:12.610
<v Speaker 5>along the same trail and he comes back</v>
<v Speaker 5>to New Jersey and his buddies in the bar</v>

98
00:04:12.611 --> 00:04:15.430
<v Speaker 5>and he just sits down next to him at the</v>
<v Speaker 5>bar and touches the ring on the,</v>

99
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.700
<v Speaker 5>on the bar.</v>

100
00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:20.150
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I found it wholly shaking.</v>

101
00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:21.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

102
00:04:21.471 --> 00:04:24.680
<v Speaker 4>What are the odds of all the steps she</v>
<v Speaker 4>could have taken?</v>

103
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:25.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The places she could have gone.</v>

104
00:04:25.941 --> 00:04:29.960
<v Speaker 4>I mean they probably told her what trail</v>
<v Speaker 4>that he took or whatever.</v>

105
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.970
<v Speaker 4>Just the whole trail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

106
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.240
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone telling you I lost my wedding</v>

107
00:04:35.241 --> 00:04:37.130

112
00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.030
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's pretty bad,</v>

113
00:04:47.031 --> 00:04:49.790
<v Speaker 4>but it's like the state of the art</v>
<v Speaker 4>consumer model,</v>

114
00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.190
<v Speaker 4>metal detector.</v>

128
00:05:20.001 --> 00:05:20.834

<v Speaker 4>That weight.</v>

129
00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.000

<v Speaker 4>back of your 2 million pounds worth of</v>

<v Speaker 4>See if there's some sensitivity.</v>

132
00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.840
<v Speaker 4>Lack of a metal detector role model.</v>

149
00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:15.670
<v Speaker 1>it's definitely like it's in the fanny</v>
<v Speaker 1>pack realm.</v>

<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

152
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.140
<v Speaker 1>What are you doing here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly where you're given up by this</v>

153
00:06:21.141 --> 00:06:22.810
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$799.</v>

154
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:26.630
<v Speaker 1>Eight thousand thousand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>8,000 extra night in there.</v>

155
00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:27.620
<v Speaker 1>Go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

156
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:29.990
<v Speaker 1>Gold Nugget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Metal detector.</v>

157
00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:35.850
<v Speaker 1>A mind lab to easy go up into the go up</v>
<v Speaker 1>in northern California where all the</v>

158
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.100
<v Speaker 1>gold mines were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That'd be cool.</v>

159
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:40.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a move,</v>

160
00:06:40.011 --> 00:06:41.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

161
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:43.820
<v Speaker 1>So how does that fucking thing work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that works different than only</v>

162
00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:46.070
<v Speaker 1>picks up gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Set it on gold.</v>

163
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This other one had like on the top of</v>

164
00:06:47.691 --> 00:06:52.691
<v Speaker 1>the meter it has specific for gold iron.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives you different readings and then</v>

165
00:06:53.151 --> 00:06:55.130
<v Speaker 1>this thing is called a pinpoint or</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever that is.</v>

166
00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm only interested in gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

167
00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:00.770
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you this is one of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that there's a fucking rabbit</v>

168
00:07:00.771 --> 00:07:03.530
<v Speaker 1>hole and you start with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and next thing you know,</v>

169
00:07:03.531 --> 00:07:06.230
<v Speaker 1>you're kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Minor magazine in the mail,</v>

170
00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:10.340
<v Speaker 1>you're subscribing to these websites</v>
<v Speaker 1>where people go on these,</v>

171
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:11.473
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

172
00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:15.500
<v Speaker 1>metal detector.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your wife comes into your but Dan and</v>

173
00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:17.750
<v Speaker 1>you have a miner's helmet with a light</v>
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>

174
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:20.580
<v Speaker 1>Aren't you coming to bed</v>
<v Speaker 1>late?</v>

175
00:07:20.581 --> 00:07:21.414
<v Speaker 1>A minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honey,</v>

176
00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.371
<v Speaker 1>for real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

177
00:07:22.371 --> 00:07:25.700
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you find out about a treasure</v>

178
00:07:25.701 --> 00:07:27.600
<v Speaker 1>somewhere and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

179
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:28.940
<v Speaker 1>I can find it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

180
00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:30.190
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty hard to find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

181
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.230
<v Speaker 1>have you ever seen those documentaries</v>
<v Speaker 1>on those guys that are professional</v>

182
00:07:33.231 --> 00:07:34.850
<v Speaker 1>shipwreck hunters?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

183
00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.620
<v Speaker 1>Dude is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's real crazy money in that real.</v>

184
00:07:39.621 --> 00:07:43.190
<v Speaker 1>And if they know we're a viking ship</v>
<v Speaker 1>went down or Roman ship went down,</v>

185
00:07:43.191 --> 00:07:46.100
<v Speaker 1>they know where they're pretty sure that</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's some gold.</v>

186
00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:47.840
<v Speaker 1>There has been several times that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>

187
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.720
<v Speaker 1>Let's find out actually what the biggest</v>
<v Speaker 1>bounty was,</v>

188
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:51.980
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a guess.</v>

189
00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:55.250
<v Speaker 1>Well you've got to figure the</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology's probably just improved,</v>

190
00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:57.350
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And like the last 30 years,</v>

191
00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.030
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has made such a jump,</v>

192
00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:02.390
<v Speaker 1>so why it's probably a good time to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

193
00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:06.890
<v Speaker 1>People have been probably trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>search but couldn't go down too deep or.</v>

194
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:08.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're really good at it now you know,</v>

195
00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.150
<v Speaker 1>there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also the ocean is fucking huge.</v>

196
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.460
<v Speaker 1>So if you find something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the odds of somebody else finding it</v>

197
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.490
<v Speaker 1>without you telling them about it and</v>
<v Speaker 1>without somebody leaking some</v>

198
00:08:16.491 --> 00:08:20.990
<v Speaker 1>information so it's really touch and go</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these guys invest a shitload of</v>

199
00:08:20.991 --> 00:08:23.000
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they have the divers who are these</v>

200
00:08:23.001 --> 00:08:25.250
<v Speaker 1>people that are usually the people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>are knowledgeable but they don't really</v>

201
00:08:25.251 --> 00:08:28.100
<v Speaker 1>have the funds and then they meet</v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody and that guy funds it,</v>

202
00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:30.020
<v Speaker 1>but it's super squirrely.</v>

203
00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:32.090
<v Speaker 1>Like who gets the money and how much do</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get?</v>

204
00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.250
<v Speaker 1>And his brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a coke dealer,</v>

205
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone's got a gun,</v>

206
00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:41.260
<v Speaker 1>someone's got her girlfriends to Tan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything's just super confusing.</v>

207
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:44.000
<v Speaker 1>She's really friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She being so nice to me.</v>

208
00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:46.970
<v Speaker 1>She want to fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is going to be murder suicide.</v>

209
00:08:46.971 --> 00:08:47.400
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all gonna.</v>

210
00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:50.270
<v Speaker 1>Go down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched this one and these,</v>

211
00:08:50.271 --> 00:08:51.740
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys had found,</v>

212
00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:55.530
<v Speaker 1>I want to say it was more than a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 1>million dollars in gold.</v>

213
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:57.810
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had found at the bottom of the</v>

214
00:08:57.811 --> 00:08:58.890
<v Speaker 1>ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I might be making that.</v>

215
00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.340
<v Speaker 1>That's a really good one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I found their operations have to be</v>

216
00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.820
<v Speaker 1>related to the discovery of the San</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jose,</v>

217
00:09:04.821 --> 00:09:09.821
<v Speaker 1>Shipwreck and Columbia and 2015.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much.</v>

218
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:12.150
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me guess</v>

219
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:15.440
<v Speaker 1>really high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really,</v>

220
00:09:15.441 --> 00:09:18.200
<v Speaker 1>really done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That do.</v>

221
00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.080
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't have done that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would've come in low.</v>

222
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:23.130
<v Speaker 1>San Jose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was going to say two point</v>

223
00:09:23.131 --> 00:09:24.980
<v Speaker 1>$4,000,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Woo.</v>

224
00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.830
<v Speaker 1>That's a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say one point $8 billion.</v>

225
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:30.810
<v Speaker 1>I never would have said billion by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

226
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:32.090
<v Speaker 1>He didn't say that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

227
00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:33.810
<v Speaker 1>One point eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

228
00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.160
<v Speaker 1>What did I say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two point something.</v>

229
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:40.490
<v Speaker 1>Two point 4 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus Christ to discovery the San Jose</v>

230
00:09:41.701 --> 00:09:44.520
<v Speaker 1>shipwreck has all the elements of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>great drama,</v>

231
00:09:44.521 --> 00:09:48.570
<v Speaker 1>international political intrigue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a treasure of golden emeralds worth up</v>

232
00:09:48.571 --> 00:09:49.870
<v Speaker 1>to $17,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion.</v>

233
00:09:49.871 --> 00:09:54.180
<v Speaker 1>And now accusations of lying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone always forgets about emeralds.</v>

234
00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:56.490
<v Speaker 1>Everyone forgets about emeralds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sleep on Emerald,</v>

235
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:59.910
<v Speaker 1>I sleep on them all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never take them seriously.</v>

236

<v Speaker 1>The dream.</v>

265
00:11:17.011 --> 00:11:22.011
<v Speaker 1>Catchers are selling</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a man with a turquoise bracelet.</v>

266
00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:30.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a place called the Silverman</v>

267
00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:35.080
<v Speaker 1>when I was in school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a in New Jersey near my high</v>

268
00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:37.140
<v Speaker 1>school and when I was first getting into</v>
<v Speaker 1>girls,</v>

269
00:11:37.141 --> 00:11:39.150
<v Speaker 1>that's where I would go to buy jewelry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That gifts to my girl.</v>

270
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember being there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I wonder.</v>

271
00:11:42.850 --> 00:11:44.610
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if I could wear some of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>

272
00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:48.690
<v Speaker 1>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Silverman,</v>

273
00:11:49.020 --> 00:11:53.130
<v Speaker 1>I remember there was a movie that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>his great wrestling movie called vision</v>

274
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:54.820
<v Speaker 1>with Matthew Modine</v>

275
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:58.510
<v Speaker 4>and his friend on the show is this</v>
<v Speaker 4>native American kid turned out to not</v>

276
00:11:58.511 --> 00:12:00.280
<v Speaker 4>really be native American.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ah.</v>

277
00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:03.580
<v Speaker 4>It turned out that that was like his big</v>
<v Speaker 4>hustle in the movie was that he was</v>

278
00:12:03.581 --> 00:12:06.490
<v Speaker 4>telling everybody who's native American</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking about you going on a vision</v>

279
00:12:06.491 --> 00:12:09.100
<v Speaker 4>quest and your spirit journey and all</v>
<v Speaker 4>this stuff.</v>

280
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.220
<v Speaker 4>Because I don't know what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember,</v>

281
00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.900
<v Speaker 4>but I remember that in the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

282
00:12:13.901 --> 00:12:16.390
<v Speaker 4>That dude right there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That turned out to not really be native</v>

283
00:12:16.391 --> 00:12:17.830
<v Speaker 4>American.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just bullshit.</v>

284
00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:18.620
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>bad on you,</v>

285
00:12:18.620 --> 00:12:20.880
<v Speaker 4>Matthew Modine for thinking that it was</v>
<v Speaker 4>a.</v>

286
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.140
<v Speaker 4>It looks native American.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

287
00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:27.520
<v Speaker 4>It looks more like culture club.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks like an Indian man.</v>

288
00:12:27.521 --> 00:12:28.211
<v Speaker 4>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

289
00:12:28.211 --> 00:12:30.160

<v Speaker 4>Is it?</v>

290
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:31.240
<v Speaker 4>Same Guy?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

291
00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.100
<v Speaker 4>The guy who was really ringwald really</v>
<v Speaker 4>loved.</v>

292
00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:33.971
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

293
00:12:33.971 --> 00:12:34.720
<v Speaker 4>I remember that one.</v>

294
00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.440
<v Speaker 4>You know too much about those movies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was the eighties.</v>

295
00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:42.100
<v Speaker 4>I want it to be that guy because he was</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the cool guy,</v>

296
00:12:42.101 --> 00:12:44.890
<v Speaker 4>but he was so cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't hang out with the cool people</v>

297
00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.160
<v Speaker 4>and Molly ringwald fell in love with</v>
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>

298
00:12:47.230 --> 00:12:50.620
<v Speaker 4>That is the movie that wrestlers watch</v>
<v Speaker 4>for inspiration.</v>

299
00:12:50.621 --> 00:12:52.690
<v Speaker 4>Quest Vision quest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is the movie.</v>

300
00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:53.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is.</v>

301
00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.110
<v Speaker 4>That is an amazing movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Isn't really good.</v>

302
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.200
<v Speaker 4>Stocks today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You'd probably go back and watch it</v>

303
00:12:59.201 --> 00:13:00.820
<v Speaker 4>today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's probably like altered states.</v>

304
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:02.710
<v Speaker 4>A lot of synthesizer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

305
00:13:02.711 --> 00:13:04.630
<v Speaker 4>I've recommended altered states to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>blend.</v>

306
00:13:04.631 --> 00:13:07.040
<v Speaker 4>I went back and watched it myself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had to come back on the air and go,</v>

307
00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:09.210
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sorry.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I saw rob.</v>

309
00:13:10.831 --> 00:13:12.310
<v Speaker 4>Do you have an hour and a half of your</v>
<v Speaker 4>life?</v>

310
00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:15.400
<v Speaker 4>I remember thinking it was cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't the day.</v>

311
00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:16.750
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was really cool.</v>

312
00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:18.640
<v Speaker 4>It was really cool when the movie came</v>
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>

313
00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.650
<v Speaker 4>I loved.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Movies are just different now.</v>

314
00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:23.290
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Unless you see like the Godfather,</v>

315
00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:27.550
<v Speaker 4>the godfather 100 percent holds up</v>
<v Speaker 4>totally for the shining,</v>

316
00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:30.190
<v Speaker 4>the shining 100 percent wholesale.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent.</v>

317
00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.770
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent caddyshack.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

318
00:13:32.830 --> 00:13:35.410
<v Speaker 4>Caddyshack is fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Blues Brothers,</v>

319
00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:37.380
<v Speaker 4>Blues Brothers back to school.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

320
00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:41.470
<v Speaker 4>Come on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that means that maybe altered states</v>

321
00:13:41.471 --> 00:13:46.180
<v Speaker 4>wasn't that great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was different and there was a book by</v>

322
00:13:46.181 --> 00:13:49.360
<v Speaker 4>a lot on the different.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was an intriguing story.</v>

323
00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.270
<v Speaker 4>The whole thing was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have this brilliant doctor and this</v>

324
00:13:52.271 --> 00:13:54.640
<v Speaker 4>beautiful girlfriend who was also a</v>
<v Speaker 4>scientist too,</v>

325
00:13:54.641 --> 00:13:56.830
<v Speaker 4>or think you don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>

326
00:13:56.860 --> 00:14:01.860
<v Speaker 4>and so he takes this shout shamonic drug</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it changes him.</v>

327
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:05.530
<v Speaker 4>He morphs back into a monkey and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>breaks in the zoo and kills things.</v>

328
00:14:05.531 --> 00:14:06.370
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>

329
00:14:06.371 --> 00:14:10.090
<v Speaker 4>I remember right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was in the with like blood on his</v>

330
00:14:10.091 --> 00:14:10.720
<v Speaker 4>face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

331
00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.350
<v Speaker 4>Killed something in the zoo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

332
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:14.890
<v Speaker 4>The movie was based,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not really,</v>

333
00:14:14.891 --> 00:14:19.891
<v Speaker 4>but based or I should say inspired by a</v>
<v Speaker 4>guy named John Lilly who made the</v>

334
00:14:19.961 --> 00:14:22.900
<v Speaker 4>isolation tank.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was an isolation tank in it.</v>

335
00:14:22.901 --> 00:14:25.060
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's actually how I found out about</v>

336
00:14:25.061 --> 00:14:29.470
<v Speaker 4>this movie in the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He actually goes through several</v>

337
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:32.030
<v Speaker 4>generations of Lilly's isolation tanks</v>
<v Speaker 4>and sort of an Ommaya,</v>

338
00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:35.140
<v Speaker 4>like he starts out floating with the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

339
00:14:35.141 --> 00:14:37.930
<v Speaker 4>the head given where it's like a scuba</v>
<v Speaker 4>tank,</v>

340
00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:40.470
<v Speaker 4>a helmet on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the beginning of the movie.</v>

341
00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.070
<v Speaker 4>Then the end of the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's lying down.</v>

342
00:14:42.071 --> 00:14:43.480
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's how I really did it in the</v>

343
00:14:43.481 --> 00:14:47.020
<v Speaker 4>beginning and the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lily had it set up where there was</v>

344
00:14:47.021 --> 00:14:51.860
<v Speaker 4>literally like a tube connected to his</v>
<v Speaker 4>asshole so he could shit and into the</v>

345
00:14:51.861 --> 00:14:54.680
<v Speaker 4>water and it would be filtered out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we never had to leave the water.</v>

346
00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:58.970
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that would be good for road trips and he</v>

347
00:14:58.971 --> 00:14:59.750
<v Speaker 4>would,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

348
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:01.430
<v Speaker 4>lily would do it with ketamine.</v>

349
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:05.060
<v Speaker 4>He would shoot up ketamine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like a cat tranquilizer.</v>

350
00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.280
<v Speaker 4>I'm not really close to before.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It works with.</v>

351
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.260
<v Speaker 4>That looks claustrophobic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not.</v>

352
00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:10.323
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

353
00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.710
<v Speaker 4>I had done that one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've never done that one.</v>

354
00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:17.890
<v Speaker 4>The one I've done is later in the movie</v>
<v Speaker 4>as his character evolves and as the plot</v>

355
00:15:18.561 --> 00:15:22.200
<v Speaker 4>evolves later in the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he has like a more modern version,</v>

356
00:15:22.230 --> 00:15:25.160
<v Speaker 4>the isolation tank where he's like</v>
<v Speaker 4>laying flat and they don't ever</v>

357
00:15:25.161 --> 00:15:28.850
<v Speaker 4>mentioned that he figured out a better</v>
<v Speaker 4>version or anything like that.</v>

358
00:15:28.851 --> 00:15:31.760
<v Speaker 4>They just kind of put it in there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is pretty fascinating.</v>

359
00:15:31.761 --> 00:15:33.650
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he really was into it.</v>

360
00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:35.630
<v Speaker 4>You'll see the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the top one.</v>

361
00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.760
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess the top one is the tube is</v>

362
00:15:37.761 --> 00:15:40.310
<v Speaker 4>coming out of the top of the tooth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there was another one we laid flat.</v>

363
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:42.770
<v Speaker 4>What's the actor's name again?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was William hurt.</v>

364
00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:43.700
<v Speaker 4>William hurt?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

365
00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:45.650
<v Speaker 4>he was cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's a bad motherfucker.</v>

366
00:15:45.651 --> 00:15:47.570
<v Speaker 4>Remember him in broadcast news?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

367
00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:50.450
<v Speaker 4>He was so good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's been in a bunch of great movies.</v>

368
00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:53.180
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he just came back recently in something.</v>

369
00:15:53.181 --> 00:15:55.760
<v Speaker 4>I forget what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that John Lilly guy who made that</v>

370
00:15:55.761 --> 00:16:00.761
<v Speaker 4>tank was a like a legitimate,</v>
<v Speaker 4>brilliant scientist who would take all</v>

371
00:16:00.891 --> 00:16:02.330
<v Speaker 4>kinds of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>

372
00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.770
<v Speaker 4>he would experiment all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>

373
00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:08.630
<v Speaker 4>he was a pioneer in interspecies</v>
<v Speaker 4>communication research with dolphins.</v>

374
00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:10.910
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't know if you've ever heard this</v>

375
00:16:10.911 --> 00:16:13.070
<v Speaker 4>story,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the woman who was doing the</v>

376
00:16:13.071 --> 00:16:16.010
<v Speaker 4>research,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was living with a young male dolphin</v>

377
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:19.520
<v Speaker 4>and she lived in this place that was</v>
<v Speaker 4>like waist high and water,</v>

378
00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:23.240
<v Speaker 4>but so she would walk through the water</v>
<v Speaker 4>to get to a furniture to get to where</v>

379
00:16:23.241 --> 00:16:26.300
<v Speaker 4>she would cook and the dolphin lived</v>
<v Speaker 4>with her and swam around with her.</v>

380
00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:26.871
<v Speaker 4>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>wait.</v>

381
00:16:26.871 --> 00:16:28.640
<v Speaker 4>So she would be like up to her waist</v>
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>

382
00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:30.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the hallways and then she got to come</v>

383
00:16:30.411 --> 00:16:35.240
<v Speaker 4>up to a platform to cook or she had some</v>
<v Speaker 4>setup where she lived with this dolphin.</v>

384
00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:36.100
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They all.</v>

385
00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:38.750
<v Speaker 4>They lived in this tank.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Never heard of.</v>

386
00:16:38.751 --> 00:16:42.110
<v Speaker 4>This is crazy and when she did it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was there.</v>

387
00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:47.000
<v Speaker 4>Were working on these ideas that they</v>
<v Speaker 4>had to try to get dolphins to recreate</v>

388
00:16:47.001 --> 00:16:49.100
<v Speaker 4>human words like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the dolphins,</v>

389
00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.740
<v Speaker 4>even if they're not as intelligent as we</v>
<v Speaker 4>are,</v>

390
00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:53.480
<v Speaker 4>which they might be,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who knows?</v>

391
00:16:53.570 --> 00:16:56.600
<v Speaker 4>They don't have the ability to make the</v>
<v Speaker 4>sounds that we make because they they</v>

392
00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:58.730
<v Speaker 4>have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't have lips and tongue.</v>

393
00:16:58.731 --> 00:17:01.430
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have a weird way of making noises.</v>

394
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:02.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they,</v>

395
00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:06.740
<v Speaker 4>they would see the dolphin came super</v>
<v Speaker 4>close to saying hello,</v>

396
00:17:07.610 --> 00:17:08.660
<v Speaker 4>Kim.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really close to it.</v>

397
00:17:08.661 --> 00:17:10.100
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of weird when you hear it too.</v>

398
00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:13.790
<v Speaker 4>There was a movie done where they were</v>
<v Speaker 4>talking to the dolphins and they and it</v>

399
00:17:13.791 --> 00:17:14.280
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

400
00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:16.640
<v Speaker 4>she had a sexual relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're pulling that up positive to get</v>

401
00:17:16.641 --> 00:17:17.474
<v Speaker 4>to that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jamie,</v>

402
00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:20.870
<v Speaker 4>do you remember that movie?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

403
00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.410
<v Speaker 4>This is why they canceled it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

404
00:17:23.550 --> 00:17:27.260
<v Speaker 4>does it say it says a woman in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>waterproofed house in 1964,</v>

405
00:17:27.261 --> 00:17:28.930
<v Speaker 4>a woman lived in a waterproof health</v>
<v Speaker 4>with a,</v>

406
00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:32.240
<v Speaker 4>with a dolphin called Peter tried to</v>
<v Speaker 4>teach them English and had a sexual</v>

407
00:17:32.241 --> 00:17:33.140
<v Speaker 4>relationship with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

408
00:17:33.141 --> 00:17:37.820
<v Speaker 4>my sword of she would jerk him off</v>
<v Speaker 4>because he would get super horny and</v>

409
00:17:37.821 --> 00:17:40.730
<v Speaker 4>that's all he would want to do is fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And he was confusing and it was</v>

410
00:17:40.731 --> 00:17:43.700
<v Speaker 4>interfering with the research.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So she didn't think there was anything</v>

411
00:17:43.701 --> 00:17:45.380
<v Speaker 4>wrong with jerking off this dolphin.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

412
00:17:45.381 --> 00:17:47.030
<v Speaker 4>I don't either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look,</v>

413
00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:48.710
<v Speaker 4>there's nothing wrong with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey.</v>

414
00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.520
<v Speaker 4>It's like they live together.</v>

415
00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:51.230
<v Speaker 4>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

416
00:17:51.230 --> 00:17:53.310
<v Speaker 4>Why are we so weird about sexual</v>
<v Speaker 4>pleasure?</v>

417
00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:54.900
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck is that?</v>

418
00:17:54.930 --> 00:17:57.450
<v Speaker 4>Man?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're so weird.</v>

419
00:17:57.990 --> 00:17:59.790
<v Speaker 4>It is a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's very complicated.</v>

420
00:17:59.791 --> 00:18:01.980
<v Speaker 4>It's the driving force of all of us and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

421
00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:03.323
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

422
00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:07.500
<v Speaker 4>it's a bent and twisted and it's pure</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's nice and it's,</v>

423
00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:09.450
<v Speaker 4>it's a weird thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

424
00:18:09.451 --> 00:18:12.630
<v Speaker 4>But if you have friend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I had a friend who's a jerk off his</v>

425
00:18:12.631 --> 00:18:17.631
<v Speaker 4>dog with his foot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't have that friend he got,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I go free.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Real lucky touch.</v>

427
00:18:19.810 --> 00:18:22.740
<v Speaker 4>We put my sock on and I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what'd you do?</v>

428
00:18:22.741 --> 00:18:24.260
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

00:18:24.330 --> 00:18:26.520
<v Speaker 4>Dogs horny.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So put my foot on his dick.</v>

430
00:18:26.521 --> 00:18:28.770
<v Speaker 4>And I rubbed it back and forth and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>came all over stomach.</v>

431
00:18:28.771 --> 00:18:32.610
<v Speaker 4>I was seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he felt better and I go,</v>

<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's you.</v>

434
00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.160
<v Speaker 4>I think it's me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's made with a stupid problem</v>

435
00:18:38.161 --> 00:18:39.930
<v Speaker 4>in my head about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The dog likes it.</v>

436
00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.990
<v Speaker 4>How come you can scratch behind the</v>
<v Speaker 4>dog's ears where he can't reach and</v>

437
00:18:42.991 --> 00:18:44.630
<v Speaker 4>that's okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But come,</v>

438
00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:48.780
<v Speaker 4>you can't rub his dick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever touched your dog's Dick?</v>

439
00:18:48.781 --> 00:18:50.100
<v Speaker 4>Accidentally when you're rubbing his</v>
<v Speaker 4>belly?</v>

440
00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:52.050
<v Speaker 4>My dog has a vagina.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

441
00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:54.330

<v Speaker 4>Accidentally.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

444
00:18:56.910 --> 00:18:57.930

<v Speaker 4>Touch my dog's Dick 100 times and he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>only five months old.</v>

446

00:19:47.361 --> 00:19:48.171
<v Speaker 4>he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>

470
00:19:48.171 --> 00:19:50.470
<v Speaker 4>you tore this thing apart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And Nice.</v>

471
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:52.940
<v Speaker 4>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was Frank Sinatra.</v>

472
00:19:52.941 --> 00:19:54.200
<v Speaker 4>That was my dog named Frank.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

473
00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.420
<v Speaker 4>that's awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

474
00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:58.610
<v Speaker 4>he wasn't swollen when I brought him to</v>
<v Speaker 4>the vet.</v>

475
00:19:58.611 --> 00:20:01.970
<v Speaker 4>Then when I got him home he started</v>
<v Speaker 4>swelling up like a half hour later it</v>

476
00:20:01.971 --> 00:20:05.020
<v Speaker 4>starts swelling up and then it just gets</v>
<v Speaker 4>like to these cartoonish proportions,</v>

477
00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:07.430
<v Speaker 4>but half their faces hanging off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

478
00:20:07.431 --> 00:20:09.010
<v Speaker 4>it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she was just asking</v>

479
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:11.960
<v Speaker 5>a little weird this morning and you</v>
<v Speaker 5>know,</v>

480
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:13.020
<v Speaker 5>we have a yard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So like,</v>

481
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:14.820
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe someone got into the backyard,</v>

482
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:15.860
<v Speaker 5>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but she,</v>

483
00:20:15.861 --> 00:20:19.850
<v Speaker 5>all of a sudden her,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was a little puffy and I said to my</v>

484
00:20:19.851 --> 00:20:22.060
<v Speaker 5>wife would look at her eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she look a little weird.</v>

485
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:23.810
<v Speaker 5>She was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think she's having a reaction.</v>

486
00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:26.690
<v Speaker 5>So he brought her into the vet on my way</v>
<v Speaker 5>here and uh,</v>

487
00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:28.640
<v Speaker 5>they rushed her right in and they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

488
00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:31.340
<v Speaker 5>good thing you got here early and</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're going to work on her.</v>

489
00:20:31.341 --> 00:20:33.440
<v Speaker 5>So I don't know what's up,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we're trying to figure,</v>

490
00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.340
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can they get sick from eating,</v>

491
00:20:37.341 --> 00:20:40.700
<v Speaker 5>raccoon feces.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ever hear that?</v>

492
00:20:40.701 --> 00:20:40.870
<v Speaker 5>I would</v>

493
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:44.380
<v Speaker 4>not imagine it'd be good for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I noticed because we had a trainer that</v>

494
00:20:44.381 --> 00:20:45.970
<v Speaker 4>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she's not eating that is here.</v>

495
00:20:45.971 --> 00:20:46.631
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

496
00:20:46.631 --> 00:20:47.500
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that big deal?</v>

497
00:20:47.501 --> 00:20:48.670
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she eats everything.</v>

498
00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:50.140
<v Speaker 4>He's like a goat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

499
00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:51.493
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as,</v>

500
00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:53.890
<v Speaker 4>that's the only thing I could think of</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I couldn't.</v>

501
00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:55.660
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's definitely got to be something</v>

502
00:20:55.661 --> 00:20:56.470
<v Speaker 4>in that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

503
00:20:56.470 --> 00:20:59.020
<v Speaker 4>raccoons have to have parasites.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're wild animals.</v>

504
00:20:59.021 --> 00:21:00.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's got to have some weird.</v>

505
00:21:01.430 --> 00:21:03.610
<v Speaker 4>They're wild animals too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they eat animals,</v>

506
00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.740
<v Speaker 4>so as soon as an animal is eating other</v>
<v Speaker 4>animals,</v>

507
00:21:05.741 --> 00:21:08.560
<v Speaker 4>that's when shit gets weird right now</v>
<v Speaker 4>for wild animal.</v>

508
00:21:08.561 --> 00:21:10.710
<v Speaker 4>Like you could eat a deer raw.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

509
00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.560
<v Speaker 4>And there'd be no problem at all.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

510
00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:14.260
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The real problem is animals that eat</v>

511
00:21:14.261 --> 00:21:17.590
<v Speaker 4>animals</v>
<v Speaker 4>because the deer doesn't eat.</v>

512
00:21:17.591 --> 00:21:21.010
<v Speaker 4>Animals kill the deer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could get a pair of side and deers have</v>

513
00:21:21.011 --> 00:21:21.910
<v Speaker 4>gotten worms before.</v>

514
00:21:21.910 --> 00:21:23.690
<v Speaker 4>I've heard of people that in lyme</v>
<v Speaker 4>disease that had.</v>

515
00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:24.191
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

516
00:21:24.191 --> 00:21:26.860
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's just the ticks cause severe</v>

517
00:21:26.861 --> 00:21:31.861
<v Speaker 4>inflammatory reactions when that's not</v>
<v Speaker 4>really a specific around severe</v>

518
00:21:32.801 --> 00:21:36.820
<v Speaker 4>inflammatory maybe will migrate to other</v>
<v Speaker 4>organs including the brain.</v>

519
00:21:36.910 --> 00:21:39.240
<v Speaker 4>Oh Geez.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I,</v>

520
00:21:39.241 --> 00:21:41.440
<v Speaker 4>I've had dogs that have worms before</v>
<v Speaker 4>that were coming out of there,</v>

521
00:21:41.441 --> 00:21:46.060
<v Speaker 4>but like they poop and as they would</v>
<v Speaker 4>walk away you would see worms literally</v>

522
00:21:46.061 --> 00:21:47.200
<v Speaker 4>crawling out of their butt and you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

523
00:21:47.201 --> 00:21:48.730
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

524
00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.740
<v Speaker 4>And your lifestyle have whacked you off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When we had the kids</v>

525
00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:56.550
<v Speaker 4>would be so confused.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me put on a sock.</v>

526
00:21:56.590 --> 00:21:58.470
<v Speaker 4>Get over here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So not true.</v>

527
00:21:58.710 --> 00:22:00.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Parasitic relationships.</v>

528
00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:06.010
<v Speaker 4>Like when you think about how many dogs</v>
<v Speaker 4>have worms is like one of the number one</v>

529
00:22:06.011 --> 00:22:08.130
<v Speaker 4>things you got to do what your dog get</v>
<v Speaker 4>it dewormed.</v>

530
00:22:08.140 --> 00:22:09.590
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So often.</v>

531
00:22:09.790 --> 00:22:12.760
<v Speaker 4>So often just eating shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They eat everything.</v>

532
00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:15.490
<v Speaker 4>Everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My dog ate a magnet.</v>

533
00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:20.020
<v Speaker 4>You know how they have those magnets?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We stack magnet kids play with them.</v>

534
00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:22.340
<v Speaker 4>Strong thick ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Heavy magnet.</v>

535
00:22:22.341 --> 00:22:24.190
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've found it in his shit.</v>

536
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:25.990
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>You had came out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>came right out.</v>

538
00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:31.360
<v Speaker 4>I mean dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Intestinal tract is made out of</v>

539
00:22:31.361 --> 00:22:32.220
<v Speaker 4>barbwire,</v>

<v Speaker 4>sudden a metal rollerskate comes up to</v>

541
00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:40.510
<v Speaker 4>the ship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just a thrilling thing.</v>

542
00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:46.030
<v Speaker 4>Nastiest dog I've ever had in terms of</v>
<v Speaker 4>eating his own shit.</v>

543
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:47.440
<v Speaker 4>This new one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>He tries to eat his own shit when he</v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't anymore.</v>

545
00:22:49.961 --> 00:22:52.570
<v Speaker 4>He stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I'm sure he has like recently.</v>

546
00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:54.730
<v Speaker 4>But for the most part he does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

547
00:22:54.731 --> 00:22:56.650
<v Speaker 4>Leaves it alone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when he was a puppy,</v>

548
00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:58.600
<v Speaker 4>like when I just got him and he's a few</v>
<v Speaker 4>weeks old.</v>

00:23:00.431 --> 00:23:03.040
<v Speaker 4>trying to bite this shit as it's coming</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of his ass.</v>

551
00:23:05.260 --> 00:23:10.030
<v Speaker 4>You would have to like grab him to keep</v>
<v Speaker 4>him from eating the shit as it was</v>

552
00:23:10.031 --> 00:23:12.640
<v Speaker 4>coming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He thought it was like a Mr. softy</v>

553
00:23:12.641 --> 00:23:17.450

<v Speaker 4>Where were you were wearing?</v>

586
00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:23.030
<v Speaker 4>I don't remember.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'd be a nice boot.</v>

587
00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:25.640
<v Speaker 4>It was definitely not a wise move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

588
00:24:25.670 --> 00:24:28.410
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just something in me like said,</v>

589
00:24:28.490 --> 00:24:29.301
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>first of all,</v>

590
00:24:29.301 --> 00:24:32.330
<v Speaker 4>my friends would want me to kill this</v>
<v Speaker 4>isn't one fucking snake in his yard.</v>

591
00:24:32.330 --> 00:24:33.460
<v Speaker 4>Words kids live.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

592
00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:35.930
<v Speaker 4>And second of all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

593
00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:39.170
<v Speaker 4>I think I could do it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was one of those things like,</v>

594
00:24:39.171 --> 00:24:41.880
<v Speaker 4>I think this snake is slipping on me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not looking.</v>

595
00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:44.630
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't know because most people are</v>
<v Speaker 4>not going to just stomp your fucking</v>

596
00:24:44.631 --> 00:24:45.980
<v Speaker 4>head of your rattlesnake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

597
00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:47.750
<v Speaker 4>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dad is the move right now.</v>

598
00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:48.710
<v Speaker 4>Just try to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

599
00:24:48.711 --> 00:24:51.200
<v Speaker 4>the rattlesnakes instinct is humans run</v>
<v Speaker 4>from me.</v>

600
00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:52.053
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's,</v>

601
00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:56.660
<v Speaker 4>it's like you kinda see some people tell</v>
<v Speaker 4>you not supposed to do it.</v>

602
00:24:56.870 --> 00:24:58.520
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I understand what they're saying.</v>

603
00:24:58.730 --> 00:25:01.370
<v Speaker 4>Like I would not want all the rattle</v>
<v Speaker 4>snakes to die.</v>

604
00:25:01.371 --> 00:25:05.150
<v Speaker 4>I'm not a rattlesnake hater,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I have rules and if you get into my</v>

605
00:25:05.151 --> 00:25:06.430
<v Speaker 4>house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're a snake in your,</v>

606
00:25:06.450 --> 00:25:09.080
<v Speaker 4>my house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to fucking kill you for sure.</v>

607
00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.150
<v Speaker 4>One hundred percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's not my house,</v>

608
00:25:11.151 --> 00:25:14.210
<v Speaker 4>but I mean it was in front of my</v>
<v Speaker 4>friend's house and he has kids.</v>

609
00:25:14.330 --> 00:25:15.590
<v Speaker 4>That's a dead snake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

610
00:25:15.591 --> 00:25:18.020
<v Speaker 4>Kill that sense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I personally would not have done it,</v>

611
00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:19.780
<v Speaker 4>but it was a garter snake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like,</v>

612
00:25:19.790 --> 00:25:21.410
<v Speaker 4>I've seen those.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't bother them.</v>

613
00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:22.460
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not.</v>

614
00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:23.930
<v Speaker 4>Where they're going to gum you to death.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

615
00:25:23.931 --> 00:25:27.260
<v Speaker 4>But this guy also has a little dogs to</v>
<v Speaker 4>dogs get jacked.</v>

616
00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:29.360
<v Speaker 4>Maybe she got bit by a snake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh Dude.</v>

617
00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:31.440
<v Speaker 4>Easily,</v>
<v Speaker 4>easily happen.</v>

618
00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:33.830
<v Speaker 4>I've had three dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bit By rattlesnakes in California.</v>

619
00:25:33.831 --> 00:25:34.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're all over.</v>

620
00:25:34.761 --> 00:25:36.280
<v Speaker 4>I almost got bit by one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was,</v>

621
00:25:36.281 --> 00:25:39.260
<v Speaker 4>while I was hiking down a little trail,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I might have said this last time I was</v>

622
00:25:39.261 --> 00:25:43.400
<v Speaker 4>walking down a trail and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my wife was behind me and uh,</v>

623
00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:47.750
<v Speaker 4>it was a narrow part and I just came</v>
<v Speaker 4>around the corner and the thing just</v>

624
00:25:47.751 --> 00:25:49.010
<v Speaker 4>went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

625
00:25:49.450 --> 00:25:50.450
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right at me.</v>

626
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:53.210
<v Speaker 4>And I just backed up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just ran right past.</v>

627
00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:55.520
<v Speaker 4>My wife says,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why are we running?</v>

628
00:25:55.940 --> 00:25:59.150
<v Speaker 4>And they came back and he was pissed off</v>
<v Speaker 4>at the edge of the trail and this little</v>

629
00:25:59.151 --> 00:26:03.050
<v Speaker 4>Bush and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just threw rocks at it and ran past</v>

630
00:26:03.051 --> 00:26:03.710
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Coulda.</v>

631
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:04.990
<v Speaker 4>Got You.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can totally.</v>

632
00:26:04.991 --> 00:26:06.830
<v Speaker 4>Then when this is now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the thing,</v>

633
00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:10.550
<v Speaker 4>and I'm still not clear on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're two miles up in the mountain.</v>

634
00:26:11.150 --> 00:26:15.410
<v Speaker 4>They say you're not supposed to move or</v>
<v Speaker 4>else you'll get it pumping through your</v>

635
00:26:15.411 --> 00:26:16.041
<v Speaker 4>system.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

636
00:26:16.041 --> 00:26:17.570
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you make a tourniquet?</v>

637
00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:19.830
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

638
00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.250
<v Speaker 4>I still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should have learned since then,</v>

639
00:26:22.251 --> 00:26:26.000
<v Speaker 4>but the idea that my wife would have</v>
<v Speaker 4>carried me out doesn't make sense.</v>

640
00:26:26.410 --> 00:26:27.820
<v Speaker 4>We'll go for help,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>

641
00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:29.000
<v Speaker 4>Is kind of tough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

642
00:26:29.001 --> 00:26:31.250
<v Speaker 4>two mile hike down the mountain and</v>
<v Speaker 4>back.</v>

643
00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:33.530
<v Speaker 4>They make snake proof boots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You should look into him.</v>

644
00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:36.650
<v Speaker 4>Maybe snakes like you maybe like one of</v>
<v Speaker 4>those people that like,</v>

645
00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.360
<v Speaker 4>people like mosquitoes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>mosquitoes,</v>

646
00:26:38.361 --> 00:26:41.600
<v Speaker 4>like people you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I could be right next to it by all</v>

647
00:26:41.601 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 4>the mosquitoes everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's rattlesnakes.</v>

867
00:36:16.950 --> 00:36:20.550

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:23.790
<v Speaker 1>like point and the laughter that let</v>

<v Speaker 1>What if you climb of the shower and</v>

<v Speaker 1>weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I catch myself a lot.</v>

875
00:36:40.950 --> 00:36:44.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm totally naked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as long as I put everything in my</v>

876
00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:47.580
<v Speaker 1>palm of my hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be okay if they happen to</v>

877
00:36:47.581 --> 00:36:49.140
<v Speaker 1>catch me too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My sister weird.</v>

878
00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:52.500
<v Speaker 1>My seven year old stands in front of</v>
<v Speaker 1>shower door points in my deck and laughs</v>

00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:59.400
<v Speaker 1>My youngest is hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's really funny,</v>

881
00:36:59.401 --> 00:37:00.530
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's just like,</v>

882
00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:03.870
<v Speaker 1>all she wants to do is go for the laugh</v>
<v Speaker 1>like all the time.</v>

883
00:37:04.350 --> 00:37:07.650
<v Speaker 1>She's constantly just going for the lab</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's her thing is that she's like</v>

884
00:37:07.651 --> 00:37:09.000
<v Speaker 1>really silly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And so like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's like really silly at school.</v>

886
00:37:11.411 --> 00:37:13.620
<v Speaker 1>She's really silly at home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's my little one.</v>

887
00:37:13.650 --> 00:37:15.300
<v Speaker 1>She just loves having fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

888
00:37:15.690 --> 00:37:16.850
<v Speaker 1>Good student.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

889
00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:18.360
<v Speaker 1>she's real good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She's a great kid,</v>

890
00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:21.810
<v Speaker 1>which is really interesting to see kids</v>
<v Speaker 1>grow up without the same kind of</v>

891
00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:26.870
<v Speaker 1>financial pressure that I grew up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>or that you grew up with two or the not</v>

892
00:37:26.871 --> 00:37:28.930
<v Speaker 1>the same kind of weirdness in the house</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had.</v>

893
00:37:28.931 --> 00:37:30.670
<v Speaker 1>There's no like when the dad isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

894
00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:34.140
<v Speaker 1>it's Dan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when dad's not freaking out that</v>

895
00:37:34.141 --> 00:37:35.400
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also,</v>

896
00:37:35.550 --> 00:37:37.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think people know more about</v>

897
00:37:37.981 --> 00:37:38.880
<v Speaker 1>people now.</v>

898
00:37:39.090 --> 00:37:40.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think our parents didn't even have a</v>

899
00:37:40.681 --> 00:37:42.030
<v Speaker 1>chance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

900
00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:44.280
<v Speaker 1>they were trying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even understand themselves.</v>

901
00:37:44.281 --> 00:37:48.750
<v Speaker 1>Let alone understand time with you and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was going to make you feel good and</v>

902
00:37:48.751 --> 00:37:50.790
<v Speaker 1>most likely they were crazy young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like how old were you?</v>

903
00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:52.030
<v Speaker 1>Twenty?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

904
00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:54.780
<v Speaker 1>my mom was 20 or 21.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was 20 when she got pregnant.</v>

905
00:37:54.781 --> 00:37:55.410
<v Speaker 1>Twenty one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chad.</v>

906
00:37:55.410 --> 00:37:56.160
<v Speaker 1>Me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

907
00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.020
<v Speaker 1>If I can go back and think about when I</v>
<v Speaker 1>was 20.</v>

908
00:37:58.021 --> 00:38:00.540
<v Speaker 1>If somebody told me how to raise a kid</v>
<v Speaker 1>at 20.</v>

909
00:38:00.541 --> 00:38:02.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

910
00:38:02.131 --> 00:38:05.440
<v Speaker 1>I'd have a grownup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A psychopath right now that I've been</v>

911
00:38:05.490 --> 00:38:06.480
<v Speaker 1>trying to manage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

912
00:38:06.481 --> 00:38:09.390
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got the whole thing wrong.</v>

913
00:38:09.391 --> 00:38:12.930
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how we can redo this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think about that sometimes.</v>

914
00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:16.050
<v Speaker 1>You really have to let.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I let I let my parents off the hook all</v>

915
00:38:16.051 --> 00:38:20.340
<v Speaker 1>the time now just in my memories because</v>
<v Speaker 1>like when my dad said that to me,</v>

916
00:38:20.341 --> 00:38:22.380
<v Speaker 1>he was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was 28.</v>

917
00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:27.000
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had no idea when he was 28 before the</v>

918
00:38:27.001 --> 00:38:28.350
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

919
00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:31.050
<v Speaker 1>I think 28 today is way more</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledgeable.</v>

920
00:38:31.280 --> 00:38:32.970
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's pockets of flat earthers and</v>

921
00:38:32.971 --> 00:38:36.040
<v Speaker 1>shit out there that ruined the curve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but other than that,</v>

922
00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:41.340
<v Speaker 4>28 today is way more knowledgeable I</v>
<v Speaker 4>think then 28 of 20 years ago and yet so</v>

923
00:38:43.691 --> 00:38:48.010
<v Speaker 4>much more immature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe some in some ways,</v>

924
00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:50.680
<v Speaker 4>but I think that's generalizing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's think it's really hard to</v>

925
00:38:50.681 --> 00:38:53.770
<v Speaker 4>say people today is you're talking about</v>
<v Speaker 4>so many people.</v>

926
00:38:53.771 --> 00:38:56.140
<v Speaker 4>You're talking about $350 million</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

927
00:38:56.170 --> 00:38:58.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know the idea that people were</v>

928
00:38:59.050 --> 00:39:02.200
<v Speaker 4>like men and women were raising</v>
<v Speaker 4>families,</v>

929
00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:07.210
<v Speaker 4>doing all their hard work,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing all that like very adult stuff.</v>

930
00:39:07.810 --> 00:39:11.680
<v Speaker 4>There's an adolescence now that's</v>
<v Speaker 4>extended until your mid thirties.</v>

931
00:39:11.681 --> 00:39:13.150
<v Speaker 4>That's true.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

932
00:39:13.151 --> 00:39:16.600
<v Speaker 4>It's like they may not be as intelligent</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they don't have as much.</v>

933
00:39:16.630 --> 00:39:18.310
<v Speaker 4>They didn't have as much knowledge and</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff,</v>

934
00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:21.760
<v Speaker 4>but they were grown ups.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a distinction like I'm doing</v>

935
00:39:21.761 --> 00:39:24.190
<v Speaker 4>grown up shit now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that's almost like an</v>

936
00:39:24.191 --> 00:39:27.370
<v Speaker 4>evolutionary course?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like life gets easier and then people</v>

937
00:39:27.371 --> 00:39:29.980
<v Speaker 4>learn more about stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they don't have the same sort of</v>

938
00:39:29.981 --> 00:39:32.670
<v Speaker 4>physical resolve that people did back in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the old days.</v>

939
00:39:32.730 --> 00:39:34.140
<v Speaker 4>They had to work harder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

940
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:36.670
<v Speaker 4>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And also it's kind of like the two kind</v>

941
00:39:36.671 --> 00:39:39.040
<v Speaker 4>of go together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems like there's a direction that</v>

942
00:39:39.041 --> 00:39:40.560
<v Speaker 4>people are moving into.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

943
00:39:40.561 --> 00:39:41.750
<v Speaker 4>And we'll think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

944
00:39:42.460 --> 00:39:45.280
<v Speaker 4>back then people were dying at 60,</v>
<v Speaker 4>70.</v>

945
00:39:45.281 --> 00:39:49.390
<v Speaker 4>Now if you're living to 100 W,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why shouldn't your twenties be a little</v>

946
00:39:49.391 --> 00:39:51.610
<v Speaker 4>more adolescent?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

947
00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:55.120
<v Speaker 4>Because you're going to live so much</v>
<v Speaker 4>longer will apparently deliv longer</v>

948
00:39:55.121 --> 00:39:57.400
<v Speaker 4>thing a big,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a big part of what the live longer thing</v>

949
00:39:57.401 --> 00:39:58.061
<v Speaker 4>is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They,</v>

950
00:39:58.061 --> 00:40:00.850
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they reduced a lot of infant mortality</v>

951
00:40:01.330 --> 00:40:03.910
<v Speaker 4>and a lot of is like the average of how</v>
<v Speaker 4>people die.</v>

952
00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:06.070
<v Speaker 4>It's also infections when you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>younger.</v>

953
00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:08.320
<v Speaker 4>Colon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all sorts of things before medical</v>

954
00:40:08.321 --> 00:40:10.900
<v Speaker 4>science.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the actual age that people live to</v>

955
00:40:10.930 --> 00:40:12.700
<v Speaker 4>hasn't really changed as much as people</v>
<v Speaker 4>think.</v>

956
00:40:12.730 --> 00:40:13.630
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

957
00:40:13.631 --> 00:40:15.460
<v Speaker 4>I thought it did too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's what it really is,</v>

958
00:40:15.461 --> 00:40:15.900
<v Speaker 4>is that.</v>

959
00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:20.610
<v Speaker 4>Didn't Chris Ryan explained that to us?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe it was Dr Chris Ryan Phd.</v>

960
00:40:20.730 --> 00:40:22.210
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>author of sex at dawn.</v>

961
00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:24.550
<v Speaker 4>A good friend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know him well,</v>

962
00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:28.240
<v Speaker 4>but he,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe he was one who educated us on</v>

963
00:40:28.241 --> 00:40:29.061
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That what,</v>

964
00:40:29.061 --> 00:40:32.470
<v Speaker 4>what's going on is that you're counting</v>
<v Speaker 4>in infant mortality.</v>

965
00:40:32.810 --> 00:40:34.200
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>used to be like,</v>

966
00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:37.060
<v Speaker 4>if people got an infection,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a blood infection before</v>

967
00:40:37.061 --> 00:40:37.861
<v Speaker 4>antibiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 4>guests.</v>

968
00:40:37.861 --> 00:40:38.550
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're dead.</v>

969
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:39.580
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

970
00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:41.350
<v Speaker 4>You get septic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>guess what?</v>

971
00:40:41.351 --> 00:40:42.184
<v Speaker 4>Your Dad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your Dad.</v>

973
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:45.910
<v Speaker 4>Rabies.</v>

974
00:40:45.911 --> 00:40:46.744
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your dad.</v>

975
00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:49.060
<v Speaker 4>Everybody's dead.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But yeah.</v>

976
00:40:49.061 --> 00:40:50.570
<v Speaker 4>But are people living like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't there,</v>

977
00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:53.580
<v Speaker 4>there's more like a 90 year old people</v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't there?</v>

978
00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:55.330
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would like to find that out.</v>

979
00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:57.250
<v Speaker 4>Let's find out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It also is probably cultural.</v>

980
00:40:57.251 --> 00:40:58.700
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

981
00:40:58.720 --> 00:41:02.500
<v Speaker 4>when I was in Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was talking to a guy who's 50 and he</v>

982
00:41:02.501 --> 00:41:07.501
<v Speaker 4>was acting like he was at the end of his</v>
<v Speaker 4>life just matter of factly,</v>

983
00:41:07.630 --> 00:41:08.500
<v Speaker 4>just stoically.</v>

984
00:41:08.830 --> 00:41:10.390
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have much time,</v>

985
00:41:10.391 --> 00:41:13.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and for people in the Maasai,</v>

986
00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:15.570
<v Speaker 4>they don't live that long.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

987
00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:20.580
<v Speaker 4>Because lions around fucking lines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're 50 and you haven't been eating</v>

988
00:41:21.371 --> 00:41:21.851
<v Speaker 4>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

989
00:41:21.851 --> 00:41:26.350
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What a great run of God on the goods</v>

990
00:41:26.351 --> 00:41:29.200
<v Speaker 4>have smiled upon me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I will continue.</v>

991
00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:33.170
<v Speaker 4>Cecil has not taken my life.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Says the US,</v>

992
00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:36.950
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>March of 2016 said for the first time in</v>

993
00:41:36.951 --> 00:41:40.490
<v Speaker 4>human history,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I guess people who are 65 and older will</v>

994
00:41:40.491 --> 00:41:44.180
<v Speaker 4>surpass those under five.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there'll be more people that are</v>

995
00:41:44.181 --> 00:41:47.150
<v Speaker 4>older than there are that our young</v>
<v Speaker 4>people are staying alive.</v>

996
00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:49.130
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are they last longer?</v>

997
00:41:49.900 --> 00:41:51.500
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so would you know what I'm saying?</v>

998
00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:52.573
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

999
00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:54.920
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not living longer to like 100</v>

1000
00:41:54.921 --> 00:41:56.960
<v Speaker 4>years old,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's more people that are alive</v>

1001
00:41:56.961 --> 00:42:00.710
<v Speaker 4>that are 65.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like people are staying alive,</v>

1002
00:42:00.860 --> 00:42:02.240
<v Speaker 4>but are they living longer?</v>

1003
00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:06.830
<v Speaker 4>Like what is the long age that people</v>
<v Speaker 4>live like if you don't die of something,</v>

1004
00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:09.080
<v Speaker 4>if you just die of old age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is that number?</v>

1005
00:42:09.081 --> 00:42:11.060
<v Speaker 4>And has that number moved?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1006
00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:15.290
<v Speaker 4>I think that number one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that we just fixate on that one.</v>

1007
00:42:15.291 --> 00:42:17.400
<v Speaker 4>Do I die?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's heavy man.</v>

1008
00:42:17.430 --> 00:42:21.500
<v Speaker 4>The man you ever watched Netflix and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>accidentally hit the remote and you see</v>

1009
00:42:21.590 --> 00:42:23.720
<v Speaker 4>it like there's a 48 minutes left and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

1010
00:42:23.721 --> 00:42:24.920
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now I know.</v>

1011
00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.110
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could have just been locked into this</v>

1012
00:42:27.111 --> 00:42:30.520
<v Speaker 4>movie enjoying to what it is now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>10.</v>

1013
00:42:30.530 --> 00:42:31.670
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Forty eight minutes.</v>

1014
00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:33.550
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I kind of have to pay.</v>

1015
00:42:33.551 --> 00:42:34.920
<v Speaker 4>Should I hold it?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Should I pause?</v>

1016
00:42:35.380 --> 00:42:37.190
<v Speaker 4>And sometimes you feel shitty about</v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>

1017
00:42:37.191 --> 00:42:38.270
<v Speaker 4>When you check,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>

1018
00:42:38.670 --> 00:42:40.550
<v Speaker 4>I'm really enjoying this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do I have to know?</v>

1019
00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:45.640
<v Speaker 4>Because we're retarded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I feel bad sometimes if I check my phone</v>

1020
00:42:45.861 --> 00:42:46.730
<v Speaker 4>and there's nothing on it.</v>

1021
00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:49.160
<v Speaker 4>Like why did I even do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1022
00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:51.770
<v Speaker 4>I got it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if you just obsessively like look</v>

1023
00:42:51.771 --> 00:42:56.771
<v Speaker 4>at your phone and see if you got a text.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why it's the worst thing is such a,</v>

1024
00:42:57.830 --> 00:43:00.620
<v Speaker 4>a life suck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is sometimes,</v>

1025
00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:05.070
<v Speaker 4>but again it's also something that just</v>
<v Speaker 4>needs to be managed because it's a main.</v>

1026
00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:08.300
<v Speaker 4>A major connection to news was fucked</v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

1027
00:43:08.301 --> 00:43:13.040
<v Speaker 4>Now I get the Time magazine alerts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get a New York Times alerts.</v>

1028
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:15.980
<v Speaker 4>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have the alerts.</v>

1029
00:43:15.981 --> 00:43:20.420
<v Speaker 4>I'll have the swipe left and see it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have alerts for a certain breaking</v>

1036
00:43:42.051 --> 00:43:44.720
<v Speaker 4>weeks before he took off on his</v>
<v Speaker 4>vacation.</v>

<v Speaker 4>it was nonstop.</v>

1039
00:43:47.870 --> 00:43:52.490
<v Speaker 4>There's something that was just revealed</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is really interesting that James</v>

1040
00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:57.490
<v Speaker 4>Comey has said that he ended the Hillary</v>
<v Speaker 4>Clinton investigation early because</v>

1041
00:43:58.311 --> 00:44:01.700
<v Speaker 4>there was some evidence that was</v>
<v Speaker 4>introduced against her that was clearly</v>

1042
00:44:01.701 --> 00:44:06.050
<v Speaker 4>counterfeit and from Russia and so he</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't want that evidence to leak.</v>

1043
00:44:06.230 --> 00:44:06.890
<v Speaker 4>Excuse me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That.</v>

<v Speaker 4>that's what I heard.</v>

1046
00:44:09.980 --> 00:44:13.220
<v Speaker 4>I heard some congressmen on face the</v>
<v Speaker 4>nation say that.</v>

1047
00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:15.960
<v Speaker 4>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is why this is what is going to</v>

1048
00:44:16.190 --> 00:44:18.410
<v Speaker 4>getting gigs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Get scary about all these leaks and</v>

1049
00:44:18.411 --> 00:44:19.244
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes,</v>

1050
00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:23.270
<v Speaker 4>they're taking the information from the</v>
<v Speaker 4>emails,</v>

1051
00:44:23.271 --> 00:44:24.860
<v Speaker 4>from people say like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1052
00:44:24.861 --> 00:44:28.700
<v Speaker 4>the emails from the DNC or whatever and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're leaving 99 percent of it</v>

1053
00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:29.780
<v Speaker 4>perfect.</v>

1054
00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:34.590
<v Speaker 4>And they put just one little line in</v>
<v Speaker 4>that says something that's heinous or</v>

1055
00:44:34.591 --> 00:44:38.550
<v Speaker 4>says something about somebody doing</v>
<v Speaker 4>something toward or something and they</v>

1056
00:44:38.551 --> 00:44:42.330
<v Speaker 4>put that out [inaudible] that's more</v>
<v Speaker 4>dangerous than just in the old days.</v>

1057
00:44:42.331 --> 00:44:45.600
<v Speaker 4>You just try and like launch some big</v>
<v Speaker 4>story now that just bury this one little</v>

1058
00:44:45.601 --> 00:44:49.980
<v Speaker 4>item in this huge dump of information.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How do you sift through that?</v>

1059
00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:54.210
<v Speaker 4>How do you need something and it's been</v>
<v Speaker 4>leaked to Wiki leaks.</v>

1060
00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:57.290
<v Speaker 4>How do they know that it hasn't been</v>
<v Speaker 4>altered exactly.</v>

1061
00:44:57.480 --> 00:44:59.460
<v Speaker 4>Is that something that they do checks</v>
<v Speaker 4>on?</v>

1062
00:44:59.461 --> 00:45:01.570
<v Speaker 4>Do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Find that that's what the comey thing.</v>

1063
00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:03.270
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it took a long time,</v>

1064
00:45:03.630 --> 00:45:05.580
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the initial dump it was like they</v>

1065
00:45:05.581 --> 00:45:09.270
<v Speaker 4>just go through it and what's this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But it takes a long time to sift through</v>

1066
00:45:09.271 --> 00:45:11.580
<v Speaker 4>it and see if that's really a true story</v>
<v Speaker 4>or not.</v>

1067
00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:14.070
<v Speaker 4>Because that is like bubble gum right</v>
<v Speaker 4>now.</v>

1068
00:45:14.190 --> 00:45:15.750
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's crazy.</v>

1069
00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:20.220
<v Speaker 4>That would be an amazing feat if they</v>
<v Speaker 4>could verify 100 percent the veracity of</v>

1070
00:45:20.221 --> 00:45:23.850
<v Speaker 4>these emails that are being leaked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they probably verify the sources.</v>

1071
00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:26.460
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But whether or not they could verify</v>

1072
00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:28.320
<v Speaker 4>that this hasn't been altered in any</v>
<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

1073
00:45:28.321 --> 00:45:30.720
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe we just don't understand the</v>

1074
00:45:30.721 --> 00:45:32.310
<v Speaker 4>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe they can do that.</v>

1075
00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:34.950
<v Speaker 4>They'll probably get there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean they've got to be working on it.</v>

1076
00:45:35.370 --> 00:45:37.590
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's my whole philosophy with</v>

1077
00:45:37.591 --> 00:45:40.350
<v Speaker 4>everything in life right now is</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone's working on that.</v>

1078
00:45:40.351 --> 00:45:41.720
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1079
00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:44.730
<v Speaker 4>it is so crazy as to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone's working on that.</v>

1080
00:45:45.080 --> 00:45:46.950
<v Speaker 4>Will they have.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have been working on that,</v>

1081
00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:49.260
<v Speaker 4>trying to figure out a way to use it for</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuel.</v>

1082
00:45:49.350 --> 00:45:51.270
<v Speaker 4>That would be cool.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They think they can do it too.</v>

1083
00:45:51.810 --> 00:45:52.920
<v Speaker 4>They think we're,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1084
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:56.580
<v Speaker 4>who knows how long away from using all</v>
<v Speaker 4>of our nuclear waste as fuel.</v>

1085
00:45:56.610 --> 00:45:59.250
<v Speaker 4>Who were like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

1086
00:45:59.730 --> 00:46:01.260
<v Speaker 4>a rocket ship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1087
00:46:01.290 --> 00:46:04.120
<v Speaker 4>They were talking about using,</v>
<v Speaker 4>making batteries with it.</v>

1088
00:46:04.121 --> 00:46:07.380
<v Speaker 4>A diamonds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remember that they were talking about</v>

1089
00:46:07.381 --> 00:46:12.381
<v Speaker 4>using nuclear radiation from nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 4>waste to charge diamonds as batteries at</v>

1090
00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:18.300
<v Speaker 4>some star trek stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know it sounds like where you have</v>

1091
00:46:18.301 --> 00:46:20.850
<v Speaker 4>like this one little orb of stuff in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>pirates.</v>

1092
00:46:20.970 --> 00:46:24.920
<v Speaker 4>I needed second Jamie a standby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right now.</v>

1093
00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:27.530
<v Speaker 4>It seems like they can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1094
00:46:27.550 --> 00:46:30.600
<v Speaker 4>they can't actually confirm authenticity</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the stuff they're getting.</v>

1095
00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:31.940
<v Speaker 4>They can't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1096
00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:35.070
<v Speaker 4>if the email wiki leaks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when wikileaks gets an email they</v>

1097
00:46:35.071 --> 00:46:38.080
<v Speaker 4>can't necessarily guarantee the</v>
<v Speaker 4>veracity,</v>

1098
00:46:38.110 --> 00:46:41.190
<v Speaker 4>confirm it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then they did at some point like at</v>

1099
00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:43.620
<v Speaker 4>the hip they couldn't with the hillary</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff in the beginning,</v>

1100
00:46:43.621 --> 00:46:48.621
<v Speaker 4>but at a certain like now companies will</v>
<v Speaker 4>call me saying that one thing seemed to</v>

1101
00:46:48.991 --> 00:46:53.140
<v Speaker 4>be a counterfeit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So one thing being counted for his like,</v>

1102
00:46:53.141 --> 00:46:54.690
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how do you know?</v>

1103
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:56.910
<v Speaker 4>Like they're not gonna release how they</v>
<v Speaker 4>know yet.</v>

1104
00:46:57.210 --> 00:46:58.590
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>

1105
00:46:58.591 --> 00:47:02.400
<v Speaker 4>there's a whole crazy constant</v>
<v Speaker 4>information going to go on with him and</v>

1106
00:47:02.401 --> 00:47:05.730
<v Speaker 4>this and it gets trapped.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1107
00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:06.931
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1108
00:47:06.931 --> 00:47:08.280
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's big stuff.</v>

1109
00:47:08.520 --> 00:47:10.770
<v Speaker 4>It's weird time stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's weird.</v>

1110
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:14.280
<v Speaker 4>I don't know how weird it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean I really feel like.</v>

1111
00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:19.080
<v Speaker 4>I feel like trump was running.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He didn't know what he's going to win.</v>

1112
00:47:19.081 --> 00:47:20.840
<v Speaker 4>They were just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1113
00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:22.500
<v Speaker 4>there was still,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's still a businessman.</v>

1114
00:47:22.501 --> 00:47:24.720
<v Speaker 4>They're dealing with Russia and they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing with all this stuff.</v>

1115
00:47:25.470 --> 00:47:28.650
<v Speaker 4>They weren't thinking like politicians</v>
<v Speaker 4>like this might look bad one day.</v>

1116
00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:31.600
<v Speaker 4>Then holy shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he gets through in the momentum carries</v>

1117
00:47:31.601 --> 00:47:34.330
<v Speaker 4>and now he's the guy now it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

1118
00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:38.520
<v Speaker 4>so manafort probably shouldn't have</v>
<v Speaker 4>promise made that deal with them in the,</v>

1119
00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:40.360
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what me and like all this other.</v>

1120
00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:42.970
<v Speaker 4>He kind of got caught up because he just</v>
<v Speaker 4>wasn't.</v>

1121
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:45.720
<v Speaker 4>He was a businessman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was doing that stuff,</v>

1122
00:47:46.290 --> 00:47:48.520
<v Speaker 4>but he definitely wanted to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you know,</v>

1123
00:47:48.521 --> 00:47:51.230
<v Speaker 4>you don't think he expected to win.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think he expected it to it.</v>

1124
00:47:51.250 --> 00:47:52.780
<v Speaker 4>Now he's still talking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1125
00:47:52.781 --> 00:47:55.060
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I won.</v>

1126
00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:57.700
<v Speaker 4>He says that every,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every time you ask him a question,</v>

1127
00:47:57.701 --> 00:47:59.620
<v Speaker 4>you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what do you think about palm trees?</v>

1128
00:47:59.621 --> 00:48:01.060
<v Speaker 4>Should we save those?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know,</v>

1129
00:48:01.061 --> 00:48:02.980
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's really hard for a Republican to win</v>

1130
00:48:02.981 --> 00:48:04.720
<v Speaker 4>the electoral college,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I did it.</v>

1131
00:48:04.721 --> 00:48:07.090
<v Speaker 4>Did you see the map?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just put up a map in my office and</v>

1132
00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:10.450
<v Speaker 4>doesn't that just because he likes to</v>
<v Speaker 4>congratulate himself partially,</v>

1133
00:48:10.451 --> 00:48:13.010
<v Speaker 4>but he's also a little in awe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like Paul,</v>

1134
00:48:13.020 --> 00:48:17.270
<v Speaker 4>I don't see it that way now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I see him as extremely self</v>

1135
00:48:17.271 --> 00:48:21.790
<v Speaker 4>congratulatory part of his whole Shtick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like when he talks about a television</v>

1136
00:48:21.791 --> 00:48:22.431
<v Speaker 4>show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

1137
00:48:22.431 --> 00:48:24.100
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's number one because he watches it.</v>

1138
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:25.600
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All the rating.</v>

1139
00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:30.310
<v Speaker 4>You seem shoved the guy out of the way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck was that about?</v>

1140
00:48:31.110 --> 00:48:33.940
<v Speaker 4>He's out of the way and then straighten</v>
<v Speaker 4>his jacket,</v>

1141
00:48:33.941 --> 00:48:36.520
<v Speaker 4>like a guy in a movie and when he pushed</v>
<v Speaker 4>him either way he gritted his teeth,</v>

1142
00:48:36.521 --> 00:48:37.810
<v Speaker 4>like get the fuck out of here.</v>

1143
00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:44.380
<v Speaker 4>So that's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who is the guy who pushed out of the</v>

1144
00:48:44.381 --> 00:48:45.430
<v Speaker 4>way?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's the.</v>

1145
00:48:45.431 --> 00:48:49.120
<v Speaker 4>I'm the leader of Montenegro who's just</v>
<v Speaker 4>coming into the European Union.</v>

1146
00:48:49.121 --> 00:48:51.160
<v Speaker 4>So he's there like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is my first time with all the,</v>

1147
00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:54.580
<v Speaker 4>with the whole EU.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is my first time being here and</v>

1148
00:48:54.581 --> 00:48:57.280
<v Speaker 4>they're coming up for a photo and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>shut trumps,</v>

1149
00:48:57.281 --> 00:49:01.020
<v Speaker 4>shoves him out of the way and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>straight to this thing like I'm all</v>

1150
00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:02.660
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Photos,</v>

1151
00:49:02.820 --> 00:49:07.820
<v Speaker 4>the glowing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>glowing or the counter terrorism globe</v>

1152
00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:11.980
<v Speaker 4>kind of find that you see in the photo</v>
<v Speaker 4>from the other angle,</v>

1153
00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:15.660
<v Speaker 4>like what shows what they're looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like all the desks and the crazy cli.</v>

1154
00:49:15.730 --> 00:49:18.910
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's the fucking pictures.</v>

1155
00:49:18.911 --> 00:49:21.450
<v Speaker 4>Preposterous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's everything that every conspiracy</v>

1156
00:49:21.451 --> 00:49:25.390
<v Speaker 4>go back everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every conspiracy theorists is fucking</v>

1157
00:49:25.391 --> 00:49:26.550
<v Speaker 4>terrified of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>

1158
00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:31.540
<v Speaker 4>There's a dude behind him who's dressed</v>
<v Speaker 4>in traditional Arab garb.</v>

1159
00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:33.450
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1160
00:49:33.451 --> 00:49:35.440

<v Speaker 4>trillion dollars.</v>

1161
00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:37.180
<v Speaker 4>He touching the globe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other guy.</v>

<v Speaker 4>With his perfect suit and his Iranian</v>

1163

<v Speaker 4>also touching that globe than trump with</v>

1165
00:49:46.661 --> 00:49:51.220

<v Speaker 4>He's touching the light coming up from</v>

1166
00:49:51.221 --> 00:49:54.370
<v Speaker 4>underneath like a scary camp.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A fucking story man.</v>

1167
00:49:54.371 --> 00:49:57.940
<v Speaker 4>As a movie touch.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're holding onto a globe at the same</v>

1168
00:49:57.941 --> 00:49:59.830
<v Speaker 4>time and it's glowing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so weird.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Do you think Obama would hold onto that</v>
<v Speaker 4>globe about would be like,</v>

1173
00:50:12.491 --> 00:50:13.480
<v Speaker 4>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are we doing?</v>

1174
00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:17.430
<v Speaker 4>The globe glowing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1175
00:50:17.710 --> 00:50:19.960
<v Speaker 4>What does that represent?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think we're gonna pass on the</v>

1176
00:50:19.961 --> 00:50:20.910
<v Speaker 4>globe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is it?</v>

1177
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:23.980
<v Speaker 4>Why is it glowing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Raving explanation for this.</v>

1178
00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:25.990
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Can we take this?</v>

1179
00:50:25.991 --> 00:50:26.980
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's take a picture.</v>

1180
00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:28.160
<v Speaker 4>The Fountain and Steph.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>

1181
00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:31.280
<v Speaker 5>Just all of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is so hard.</v>

1182
00:50:31.310 --> 00:50:34.310
<v Speaker 5>It's so a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a big oil grab.</v>

1183
00:50:34.410 --> 00:50:37.030
<v Speaker 6>Now I understand why dudes are out there</v>
<v Speaker 6>with the fucking metal detector.</v>

1184
00:50:37.031 --> 00:50:40.530
<v Speaker 6>Man's simplify life.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just looking for shiny rocks.</v>

1185
00:50:40.760 --> 00:50:42.980
<v Speaker 5>Joe and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm telling you,</v>

1186
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:48.190
<v Speaker 5>this bread obsession of mine is if</v>
<v Speaker 5>things are going well,</v>

1187
00:50:48.441 --> 00:50:52.250
<v Speaker 5>I'm probably not making as much bread,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but to just go in simply and just be</v>

1188
00:50:52.251 --> 00:50:56.210
<v Speaker 5>making bread with the news off and just</v>
<v Speaker 5>put on some Bob Marley and just go and</v>

1189
00:50:56.211 --> 00:50:58.760
<v Speaker 5>make bread and give it to my friends and</v>
<v Speaker 5>family.</v>

1190
00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:03.170
<v Speaker 5>It's a calming thing in these chaotic</v>
<v Speaker 5>times and I'm not,</v>

1191
00:51:04.030 --> 00:51:05.000
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's Corny,</v>

1192
00:51:05.060 --> 00:51:09.140
<v Speaker 5>but I'm not trying to be corny,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I really believe that back to basic.</v>

1193
00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:12.680
<v Speaker 5>It seems like people are just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's just simplify things.</v>

1194
00:51:12.681 --> 00:51:15.290
<v Speaker 5>This is out of whack.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Totally.</v>

1195
00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:16.430
<v Speaker 5>Let me just.</v>

1196
00:51:16.970 --> 00:51:18.730
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>bread is a task right now.</v>

1197
00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:20.960
<v Speaker 6>You've got your ingredients,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know what to do,</v>

1198
00:51:20.961 --> 00:51:22.730
<v Speaker 6>and if you do all the things that you're</v>
<v Speaker 6>supposed to do,</v>

1199
00:51:22.731 --> 00:51:25.590
<v Speaker 6>it'll come out this delicious,</v>
<v Speaker 6>amazing food that you can eat.</v>

1200
00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:27.070
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and yet it's elusive.</v>

1201
00:51:27.330 --> 00:51:29.680
<v Speaker 5>It's you have to attend to it and it's a</v>
<v Speaker 5>craft.</v>

1202
00:51:29.681 --> 00:51:30.514
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1203
00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:31.190
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

1204
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:34.010
<v Speaker 6>So this task,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it becomes this thing that your mind is</v>

1205
00:51:34.011 --> 00:51:38.210
<v Speaker 6>fixated on and you can fill your</v>
<v Speaker 6>consciousness with the nuances of this</v>

1206
00:51:38.211 --> 00:51:40.670
<v Speaker 6>task and not thinking about all the</v>
<v Speaker 6>bullshit,</v>

1207
00:51:40.671 --> 00:51:42.740
<v Speaker 6>like these fucking Weirdos grabbing</v>
<v Speaker 6>globes.</v>

1208
00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:43.910
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Exactly.</v>

1209
00:51:43.911 --> 00:51:45.960
<v Speaker 6>Makes Shit Weird.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oil deals all over.</v>

1210
00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:48.410
<v Speaker 6>The other question that we were asking</v>
<v Speaker 6>about when we were trying,</v>

1211
00:51:48.411 --> 00:51:50.410
<v Speaker 6>I was trying to double Jamie Montenegro.</v>

1212
00:51:50.530 --> 00:51:51.160
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the death,</v>

1213
00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:52.450
<v Speaker 5>the average death.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>

1214
00:51:52.510 --> 00:51:54.100
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That didn't really get to yet.</v>

1215
00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:58.600
<v Speaker 5>70 eight point eight is what it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It hasn't changed from 78 point eight</v>

1216
00:51:58.601 --> 00:51:59.434
<v Speaker 5>for men.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1217
00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:02.470
<v Speaker 5>but I think that's still based off of</v>
<v Speaker 5>that infant mortality thing added into</v>

1218
00:52:02.471 --> 00:52:05.490
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's always added into it just like</v>

1219
00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:07.840
<v Speaker 5>right out of like a James Bond.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Totally.</v>

1220
00:52:07.990 --> 00:52:10.000
<v Speaker 5>This is like x man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like star wars,</v>

1221
00:52:10.001 --> 00:52:13.570
<v Speaker 5>like you expect darth vader to like be</v>
<v Speaker 5>at the end of that and the guy comes in</v>

1222
00:52:13.571 --> 00:52:15.820
<v Speaker 5>after his to give her the report on what</v>
<v Speaker 5>happened</v>

1223
00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:19.400
<v Speaker 6>seriously though,</v>
<v Speaker 6>could you imagine being trump a guy who</v>

1224
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:22.160
<v Speaker 6>used to host a reality show on NBC?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1225
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:23.980
<v Speaker 6>He's a successful businessman.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

1226
00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:28.310
<v Speaker 6>he's a well known guy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I mean how much of that is a ramp up</v>

1227
00:52:28.311 --> 00:52:32.210
<v Speaker 6>between you or I or a lot of people that</v>
<v Speaker 6>we know that are famous,</v>

1228
00:52:32.300 --> 00:52:36.500
<v Speaker 6>like how much of it like Jerry Seinfeld</v>
<v Speaker 6>is Donald Trump a ramp up in popularity</v>

1229
00:52:36.501 --> 00:52:40.700
<v Speaker 6>over Jerry Seinfeld.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I guess he is now that he's president,</v>

1230
00:52:40.730 --> 00:52:44.930
<v Speaker 6>but when Jerry was on TV and Traumas,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're kind of commensurate.</v>

1231
00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:47.350
<v Speaker 6>You could see like Jerry Seinfeld being</v>
<v Speaker 6>president as well.</v>

1232
00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:50.720
<v Speaker 6>I sure Ronald Reagan go back to that</v>
<v Speaker 6>original picture that we were just</v>

1233
00:52:50.721 --> 00:52:53.720
<v Speaker 6>looking at.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just a couple of frames go now go and</v>

1234
00:52:53.721 --> 00:52:57.170
<v Speaker 6>think of a guy like this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Go full screen on this fucking thing.</v>

1235
00:52:57.530 --> 00:53:02.000
<v Speaker 6>Imagine Jerry Seinfeld and all of a</v>
<v Speaker 6>sudden Seinfeld gets invited to this</v>

1236
00:53:02.001 --> 00:53:07.001
<v Speaker 6>league of nations thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It looks like a superhero comic book</v>

1237
00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:09.170
<v Speaker 6>scene in one of those movies.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

1238
00:53:09.171 --> 00:53:13.670
<v Speaker 6>there's a goddamn picture of the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's a light that's on the wall.</v>

1239
00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:17.510
<v Speaker 6>All the light on the floor is blue.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's little spotlights everywhere.</v>

1240
00:53:17.511 --> 00:53:21.350
<v Speaker 6>It's all freaky and clean and perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's these little screens in front of</v>

1241
00:53:21.351 --> 00:53:22.310
<v Speaker 6>every chair.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like,</v>

1242
00:53:22.311 --> 00:53:24.890
<v Speaker 6>what the fuck is this?</v>
<v Speaker 6>This is where all the world's decisions</v>

1243
00:53:24.891 --> 00:53:25.770
<v Speaker 6>get made.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1244
00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:26.130
<v Speaker 6>It looks</v>

1245
00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:26.700
<v Speaker 4>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1246
00:53:26.700 --> 00:53:30.000
<v Speaker 4>what's the Peter Sellers movie will make</v>
<v Speaker 4>with the bottom of the strange.</v>

1247
00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:31.980
<v Speaker 4>It looks like that's just strange.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It looks like.</v>

1248
00:53:31.981 --> 00:53:33.410
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1249
00:53:33.411 --> 00:53:34.244
<v Speaker 4>just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1250
00:53:34.380 --> 00:53:37.470
<v Speaker 4>why would we expect them to make more</v>
<v Speaker 4>sense than us?</v>

1251
00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:41.520
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing about world leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they're just people and they're</v>

1252
00:53:41.521 --> 00:53:45.150
<v Speaker 4>people that have an extraordinary amount</v>
<v Speaker 4>of power with not nearly as much</v>

1253
00:53:45.180 --> 00:53:46.280
<v Speaker 4>oversight.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1254
00:53:47.190 --> 00:53:48.390
<v Speaker 4>In most countries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1255
00:53:48.420 --> 00:53:51.150
<v Speaker 4>And most of these Middle Eastern</v>
<v Speaker 4>countries and most of these,</v>

1256
00:53:51.151 --> 00:53:52.800
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they don't really have to fucking tell</v>

1257
00:53:52.801 --> 00:53:54.690
<v Speaker 4>people what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They do whatever the hell they want.</v>

1258
00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:55.390
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure.</v>

1259
00:53:55.390 --> 00:53:58.130
<v Speaker 4>A lot of these places that we have</v>
<v Speaker 4>relationships with,</v>

1260
00:53:58.140 --> 00:54:01.330
<v Speaker 4>if crazy human rights violations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you get,</v>

1261
00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:06.720
<v Speaker 4>you have to deal with good and bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't really have a look at that</v>

1262
00:54:06.871 --> 00:54:09.210
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Imagine someone like Seinfeld there.</v>

1263
00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:12.810
<v Speaker 4>Imagine if he won.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what if Seinfeld became president</v>

1264
00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.590
<v Speaker 4>and like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is this globe?</v>

1265
00:54:16.110 --> 00:54:17.460
<v Speaker 4>What are we doing with this thing on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>wall?</v>

1266
00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:20.370
<v Speaker 4>I can't find my translator.</v>

1267
00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:26.010
<v Speaker 4>Trump is he's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1268
00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:29.220
<v Speaker 4>we always think of like politicians the</v>
<v Speaker 4>same way.</v>

1269
00:54:29.221 --> 00:54:31.500
<v Speaker 4>I used to think about celebrities before</v>
<v Speaker 4>I met a few of them.</v>

1270
00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:33.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you go,</v>

1271
00:54:33.501 --> 00:54:34.410
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's just a dude.</v>

1272
00:54:34.411 --> 00:54:35.670
<v Speaker 4>He's just a dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

1273
00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:36.690
<v Speaker 4>He's just a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1274
00:54:36.730 --> 00:54:39.960
<v Speaker 4>Just a guy just happened to be there to</v>
<v Speaker 4>become famous.</v>

1275
00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:40.980
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1276
00:54:40.981 --> 00:54:43.380
<v Speaker 4>I think that's kind of the same way with</v>
<v Speaker 4>politicians.</v>

1277
00:54:43.410 --> 00:54:46.020
<v Speaker 4>We've always thought of people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the reasons why we've</v>

1278
00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:49.380
<v Speaker 4>almost like allowed them a certain</v>
<v Speaker 4>amount of leeway when it comes to</v>

1279
00:54:49.381 --> 00:54:53.430
<v Speaker 4>insincerity and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>getting caught in corruption and lies</v>

1280
00:54:54.050 --> 00:54:55.920
<v Speaker 4>with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a certain amount will like she's</v>

1281
00:54:55.921 --> 00:54:57.930
<v Speaker 4>a politician,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's a senator.</v>

1282
00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:00.390
<v Speaker 4>Just what they do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You let it slide a little bit of it</v>

1283
00:55:00.391 --> 00:55:02.940
<v Speaker 4>slide,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if it was like a friend that was</v>

1284
00:55:02.941 --> 00:55:04.950
<v Speaker 4>doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you'd have like serious problems with</v>

1285
00:55:04.951 --> 00:55:05.784
<v Speaker 4>them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1286
00:55:05.790 --> 00:55:06.623
<v Speaker 4>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1287
00:55:06.870 --> 00:55:07.800
<v Speaker 4>But look,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's.</v>

1288
00:55:07.830 --> 00:55:11.730
<v Speaker 4>Things have to be a little dirty because</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're dealing with everybody.</v>

1289
00:55:12.090 --> 00:55:13.560
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're dealing with everybody.</v>

1290
00:55:13.561 --> 00:55:15.540
<v Speaker 4>There's so many interests.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to.</v>

1291
00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:17.970
<v Speaker 4>That's what a politician is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a compromise.</v>

1292
00:55:17.971 --> 00:55:20.310
<v Speaker 4>It's playing both sides of trying to get</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff done.</v>

1293
00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:22.080
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think we've gone to.</v>

1294
00:55:22.081 --> 00:55:27.081
<v Speaker 4>This is absurd point of</v>
<v Speaker 4>misinterpreting.</v>

1295
00:55:27.210 --> 00:55:29.760
<v Speaker 4>Good for flawless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1296
00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:33.870
<v Speaker 4>There could be good people who have a</v>
<v Speaker 4>lot of dirty stuff going on.</v>

1297
00:55:33.930 --> 00:55:38.510
<v Speaker 4>No one's flawless.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea that based on the Internet,</v>

1298
00:55:38.520 --> 00:55:41.490
<v Speaker 4>we're able to get all information on</v>
<v Speaker 4>everybody all the time.</v>

1299
00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:44.910
<v Speaker 4>We can't hold people to a standard of</v>
<v Speaker 4>being flawless.</v>

1300
00:55:45.030 --> 00:55:48.540
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think you can be good while still</v>

1301
00:55:48.541 --> 00:55:51.720
<v Speaker 4>making some.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know you can.</v>

1302
00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:55.440
<v Speaker 4>If you set that parameter,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that bar,</v>

1303
00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:58.140
<v Speaker 4>you're never going to have people that</v>
<v Speaker 4>are good enough.</v>

1304
00:55:58.290 --> 00:56:00.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you're going to have these Weirdos</v>

1305
00:56:00.001 --> 00:56:03.420
<v Speaker 4>that have insane egos because those are</v>
<v Speaker 4>the only ones that are willing to take</v>

1306
00:56:03.421 --> 00:56:06.450
<v Speaker 4>the punishment of being criticized the</v>
<v Speaker 4>way trump's taking it right now,</v>

1307
00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:08.371
<v Speaker 4>but he's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1308
00:56:08.371 --> 00:56:10.440
<v Speaker 4>he's taking it away that no one's ever</v>
<v Speaker 4>taken it before.</v>

1309
00:56:10.500 --> 00:56:13.270
<v Speaker 4>You could say he deserves it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not saying that I'm not,</v>

1310
00:56:13.271 --> 00:56:14.880
<v Speaker 4>I'm not making a judgment call.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying,</v>

1311
00:56:14.881 --> 00:56:17.460
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is absolutely fascinating the way the</v>

1312
00:56:17.461 --> 00:56:22.320
<v Speaker 4>media and the way people online are</v>
<v Speaker 4>treating this president of the United</v>

1313
00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:23.500
<v Speaker 4>States,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it may be justified.</v>

1314
00:56:23.501 --> 00:56:24.070
<v Speaker 4>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not</v>

1315
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:27.100
<v Speaker 6>arguing that it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What I'm saying though is it's a very</v>

1316
00:56:27.101 --> 00:56:31.210
<v Speaker 6>unique moment in time where you see so</v>
<v Speaker 6>many people attacking the president.</v>

1317
00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:32.770
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's such a rush.</v>

1318
00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:34.660
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1319
00:56:34.661 --> 00:56:38.050
<v Speaker 5>you could say I was having a discussion</v>
<v Speaker 5>with my teenage daughter about</v>

1320
00:56:38.170 --> 00:56:42.880
<v Speaker 5>navigating online stuff and seeing what</v>
<v Speaker 5>people are doing and it's almost like</v>

1321
00:56:42.881 --> 00:56:45.670
<v Speaker 5>the president is going through the same</v>
<v Speaker 5>thing that you're going through as a</v>

1322
00:56:45.671 --> 00:56:48.850
<v Speaker 5>comedian that teenage girls are going</v>
<v Speaker 5>through.</v>

1323
00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:54.640
<v Speaker 5>This is a flood of information and</v>
<v Speaker 5>access and attacks and praise and</v>

1324
00:56:54.641 --> 00:56:57.370
<v Speaker 5>everything from everybody all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 5>24 hours a day.</v>

1325
00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:00.750
<v Speaker 5>So the same way we have to navigate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1326
00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:03.400
<v Speaker 5>when haters and all that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The same way kids do.</v>

1327
00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:08.640
<v Speaker 5>The president has to deal with a flood</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's never been this raging before.</v>

1328
00:57:10.930 --> 00:57:14.650
<v Speaker 5>I mean it is an intense,</v>
<v Speaker 5>intense thing and it almost is like who</v>

1329
00:57:14.651 --> 00:57:18.640
<v Speaker 5>else?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But somebody built for television is</v>

1330
00:57:18.790 --> 00:57:19.830
<v Speaker 5>ready for this job</v>

1331
00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:21.040
<v Speaker 6>at this time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not even him,</v>

1332
00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:24.340
<v Speaker 6>but what I was saying is that like</v>
<v Speaker 6>politicians were always like a thing,</v>

1333
00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:27.640
<v Speaker 6>not like you or I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but then all of a sudden they are thing</v>

1334
00:57:27.641 --> 00:57:31.060
<v Speaker 6>like Uri because now it's trump and he</v>
<v Speaker 6>might not be like the average person,</v>

1335
00:57:31.061 --> 00:57:31.771
<v Speaker 6>but he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you are.</v>

1336
00:57:31.771 --> 00:57:32.980
<v Speaker 6>I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1337
00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:36.580
<v Speaker 6>like I almost did a show when I was</v>
<v Speaker 6>doing the free version,</v>

1338
00:57:36.581 --> 00:57:40.420
<v Speaker 6>the new version of a fear factor.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They invited me to do it and I thought</v>

1339
00:57:40.421 --> 00:57:42.040
<v Speaker 6>about it for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I would have had to live in New York</v>

1340
00:57:42.041 --> 00:57:43.900
<v Speaker 6>for a few months and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't want to do that.</v>

1341
00:57:43.930 --> 00:57:45.580
<v Speaker 6>The new thing that's coming out,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the old.</v>

1342
00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:46.211
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the old one,</v>

1343
00:57:46.211 --> 00:57:50.020
<v Speaker 6>like in 2011 or whatever the hell it was</v>
<v Speaker 6>when we redid it again.</v>

1344
00:57:50.050 --> 00:57:52.600
<v Speaker 6>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I mean,</v>

1345
00:57:52.610 --> 00:57:55.600
<v Speaker 6>he would've been with him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I could have been hanging out with him.</v>

1346
00:57:55.601 --> 00:57:57.370
<v Speaker 6>You know what I'm saying?</v>
<v Speaker 6>On the marriage riff.</v>

1347
00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:58.070
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1348
00:57:58.070 --> 00:58:00.980
<v Speaker 5>I sat with him on the marriage trip.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We stage.</v>

1349
00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:04.280
<v Speaker 5>The first thing he said when he walked</v>
<v Speaker 5>into the dressing room was,</v>

1350
00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:05.690
<v Speaker 5>we're going to get great ratings</v>
<v Speaker 5>tonight.</v>

1351
00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:09.950
<v Speaker 5>We're going to get great ratings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was so focused and he was impressive.</v>

1352
00:58:10.070 --> 00:58:12.920
<v Speaker 5>He was tall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He was a dominant guy in the room.</v>

1353
00:58:13.490 --> 00:58:14.900
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1354
00:58:14.901 --> 00:58:18.020
<v Speaker 5>And then I'm sitting on stage with him</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we were all talking about married</v>

1355
00:58:18.021 --> 00:58:18.880
<v Speaker 5>couples.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was like a,</v>

1356
00:58:19.050 --> 00:58:20.870
<v Speaker 5>like a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you would show real people and then</v>

1357
00:58:20.871 --> 00:58:24.380
<v Speaker 5>you'd discuss their marital problems and</v>
<v Speaker 5>the celebrities would weigh in and the</v>

1358
00:58:24.381 --> 00:58:28.790
<v Speaker 5>whole time he's next to me and the whole</v>
<v Speaker 5>time he's making jokes about the girl's</v>

1359
00:58:28.791 --> 00:58:30.410
<v Speaker 5>breasts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's just like,</v>

1360
00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:32.860
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>nothing really funny.</v>

1361
00:58:32.930 --> 00:58:35.030
<v Speaker 5>He was being funny and he would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

1362
00:58:35.031 --> 00:58:37.160
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she's got something going for and then</v>

1363
00:58:37.161 --> 00:58:41.060
<v Speaker 5>he would look at me and give me a little</v>
<v Speaker 5>wink on the side and it wasn't for the</v>

1364
00:58:41.061 --> 00:58:42.650
<v Speaker 5>cameras,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just for me and it felt kind of</v>

1365
00:58:42.651 --> 00:58:43.484
<v Speaker 5>creepy,</v>

1366
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:47.070
<v Speaker 6>but it's kind of like he was just a</v>
<v Speaker 6>dude.</v>

1367
00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:52.160
<v Speaker 6>He's sitting there with me in equal</v>
<v Speaker 6>footing and now he's the president of</v>

1368
00:58:52.410 --> 00:58:55.140
<v Speaker 6>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Think about how powerful.</v>

1369
00:58:55.470 --> 00:58:58.620
<v Speaker 5>There's not one human being,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't believe in the country that</v>

1370
00:58:58.621 --> 00:59:00.720
<v Speaker 5>doesn't have the word trump go through</v>
<v Speaker 5>their brain.</v>

1371
00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:02.070
<v Speaker 5>Whether they say it out loud or not</v>

1372
00:59:02.120 --> 00:59:03.170
<v Speaker 6>all day,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all day,</v>

1373
00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:06.440
<v Speaker 6>all day,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or at least a couple times a day.</v>

1374
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:08.930
<v Speaker 6>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's so insane.</v>

1375
00:59:09.020 --> 00:59:10.970
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's initial disbelief.</v>

1376
00:59:11.240 --> 00:59:14.660
<v Speaker 6>Then there was an aftershock and now</v>
<v Speaker 6>there is a waiting for the next shoe to</v>

1377
00:59:14.661 --> 00:59:16.010
<v Speaker 6>drop.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's what every day.</v>

1378
00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:19.160
<v Speaker 6>Everybody's just sitting around waiting</v>
<v Speaker 6>for the newest scandal every day,</v>

1379
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:22.150
<v Speaker 6>waiting for the impeachment,</v>
<v Speaker 6>waiting for the lawsuits,</v>

1380
00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:24.440
<v Speaker 5>waiting for the jail.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You just want calm.</v>

1381
00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:27.980
<v Speaker 5>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have a great joke when you.</v>

1382
00:59:28.460 --> 00:59:32.690
<v Speaker 5>You've been working on about a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This isn't a job for one person,</v>

1383
00:59:33.050 --> 00:59:33.850
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>This,</v>

1384
00:59:33.850 --> 00:59:36.320
<v Speaker 5>she really should be a committee of</v>
<v Speaker 5>people running this country.</v>

1385
00:59:36.321 --> 00:59:39.170
<v Speaker 5>It's too much for somebody and I love</v>
<v Speaker 5>that joke,</v>

1386
00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:44.210
<v Speaker 5>but I think that what his job is what</v>
<v Speaker 5>that president's job is more than</v>

1387
00:59:44.211 --> 00:59:48.280
<v Speaker 5>anything is to just lead people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You Ha.</v>

1388
00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:51.110
<v Speaker 5>He has power.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All those people in those positions,</v>

1389
00:59:51.740 --> 00:59:56.450
<v Speaker 5>they have power and what they say and</v>
<v Speaker 5>what they do affects people.</v>

1390
00:59:56.690 --> 00:59:59.790
<v Speaker 5>Not Policy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just the Reagan ask her all,</v>

1391
00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:01.430
<v Speaker 5>carry themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 5>carry themselves,</v>

1392
01:00:01.431 --> 01:00:03.960
<v Speaker 5>make you feel good about the direction.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All that,</v>

1393
01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:09.040
<v Speaker 5>and right now everybody's filled with</v>
<v Speaker 5>anxiety because he's not doing that part</v>

1394
01:00:11.751 --> 01:00:14.570
<v Speaker 5>of the job well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he still goes on twitter and calls</v>

1395
01:00:14.571 --> 01:00:16.730
<v Speaker 5>people losers and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait.</v>

1396
01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:19.250
<v Speaker 5>It's like it's like a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you were saying before,</v>

1397
01:00:19.251 --> 01:00:23.270
<v Speaker 5>it's like a kid hearing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like having a be batshit crazy in the</v>

1398
01:00:23.271 --> 01:00:24.830
<v Speaker 5>house.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The house is going to be crazy.</v>

1399
01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:29.720
<v Speaker 5>If Dad is shooting heroin and he's</v>
<v Speaker 5>laying on the couch is covered and</v>

1400
01:00:29.721 --> 01:00:33.860
<v Speaker 5>cheetos and he's yelling at the wife,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the whole house is going to be freaked</v>

1401
01:00:33.861 --> 01:00:35.780
<v Speaker 5>out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what's going on.</v>

1402
01:00:36.170 --> 01:00:39.680
<v Speaker 5>But is that the price that we have to</v>
<v Speaker 5>pay to realize that our system is</v>

1403
01:00:39.681 --> 01:00:43.400
<v Speaker 5>ridiculous?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is there any the throwing the card table</v>

1404
01:00:43.401 --> 01:00:45.710
<v Speaker 5>up and is there any value in that</v>
<v Speaker 5>thought?</v>

1405
01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:48.290
<v Speaker 5>I mean other than the real issues with</v>
<v Speaker 5>the environment,</v>

1406
01:00:48.291 --> 01:00:51.200
<v Speaker 5>the rolling back,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the standards on the EPA and all the</v>

1407
01:00:51.201 --> 01:00:55.040
<v Speaker 5>different things he's doing to free</v>
<v Speaker 5>people out in the code access pipeline,</v>

1408
01:00:55.041 --> 01:00:57.620
<v Speaker 5>which I don't understand enough to know</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether or not they were going to</v>

1409
01:00:57.800 --> 01:00:58.760
<v Speaker 5>restart that.</v>

1410
01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:00.500
<v Speaker 5>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know Obama shut it down.</v>

1411
01:01:00.501 --> 01:01:02.180
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then trump brought it back up again.</v>

1412
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:04.850
<v Speaker 5>Who knows if they had made some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 5>an agreement.</v>

1413
01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:06.680
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who knows how that works.</v>

1414
01:01:06.681 --> 01:01:08.900
<v Speaker 5>Who knows if they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know how that business is very</v>

1415
01:01:08.930 --> 01:01:10.250
<v Speaker 5>dirty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's very dirty.</v>

1416
01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:11.150
<v Speaker 5>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

1417
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:12.060
<v Speaker 5>I mean it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1418
01:01:12.250 --> 01:01:15.140
<v Speaker 5>you could make a case that all of this</v>
<v Speaker 5>is a big oil grab,</v>

1419
01:01:15.170 --> 01:01:16.003
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

1420
01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:18.590
<v Speaker 5>well the Dakota pipeline stuff was</v>
<v Speaker 5>terrifying.</v>

1421
01:01:18.620 --> 01:01:22.220
<v Speaker 5>Dakota pipeline stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The head of the EPA is an oil guy.</v>

1422
01:01:22.221 --> 01:01:26.450
<v Speaker 5>The secretary of state is an Exxon guy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The people he favors more than our</v>

1423
01:01:26.451 --> 01:01:29.570
<v Speaker 5>Russian,</v>
<v Speaker 5>more than our European allies are Saudi</v>

1424
01:01:29.570 --> 01:01:33.350
<v Speaker 5>Arabia and Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>big oil business partners.</v>

1425
01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:36.890
<v Speaker 5>You could say this is just business as</v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

1426
01:01:36.900 --> 01:01:39.530
<v Speaker 5>And it's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And the thing is,</v>

1427
01:01:39.531 --> 01:01:42.710
<v Speaker 5>and this is what's so complex about it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's okay.</v>

1428
01:01:42.711 --> 01:01:45.830
<v Speaker 5>So maybe it's an oil grabbing,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the he's getting his friends rich,</v>

1429
01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:50.570
<v Speaker 5>but oil also is so much more than just</v>
<v Speaker 5>what's coming out of our cars.</v>

1430
01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:53.360
<v Speaker 5>We are so deep in oil,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

1431
01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:55.010
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not.</v>

1432
01:01:55.070 --> 01:01:59.270
<v Speaker 5>I'm my whole.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My main thing is the planet and its</v>

1433
01:01:59.271 --> 01:02:03.290
<v Speaker 5>beauty and trying to sustain it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm a complete believer in climate</v>

1434
01:02:03.291 --> 01:02:08.291
<v Speaker 5>change and all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But to naive Lee say we can just shut</v>

1435
01:02:08.781 --> 01:02:11.480
<v Speaker 5>down oil and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we can all just move along.</v>

1436
01:02:11.810 --> 01:02:14.630
<v Speaker 5>It's so much deeper than that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My nephew is a,</v>

1437
01:02:14.631 --> 01:02:17.450
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>went to just graduated from school and</v>

1438
01:02:17.451 --> 01:02:21.480
<v Speaker 5>he's big agro guy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like that's what he wants to do with his</v>

1439
01:02:21.481 --> 01:02:26.481
<v Speaker 5>whole life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>His revelation was that oil and food are</v>

1440
01:02:26.551 --> 01:02:29.820
<v Speaker 5>so interconnected.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All of the fertilizer that's creating</v>

1441
01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:33.510
<v Speaker 5>all of the food that we're eating every</v>
<v Speaker 5>day is oil based.</v>

1442
01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:36.660
<v Speaker 5>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you're trying to separate,</v>

1443
01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:38.700
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>emissions and all this stuff,</v>

1444
01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:41.850
<v Speaker 5>but just the food that we eat is so tied</v>
<v Speaker 5>to oil.</v>

1445
01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:45.810
<v Speaker 5>We need oil,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so I don't know how you fix that and how</v>

1446
01:02:45.811 --> 01:02:48.510
<v Speaker 5>you try and make good policy about it.</v>

1447
01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:50.023
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>

1448
01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:55.270
<v Speaker 6>there are alternatives to fossil fuel</v>
<v Speaker 6>based oils that they used to make</v>

1449
01:02:56.451 --> 01:03:00.230
<v Speaker 6>plastics and know that I know they can</v>
<v Speaker 6>even make class to get a hamp.</v>

1450
01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:01.530
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1451
01:03:01.531 --> 01:03:04.760
<v Speaker 6>And it's biodegradable and they've just</v>
<v Speaker 6>started to make these biodegradable,</v>

1452
01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:08.480
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>natural fiber plastic bags that are not.</v>

1453
01:03:08.481 --> 01:03:10.370
<v Speaker 6>They're made out of like a plant</v>
<v Speaker 6>plastic.</v>

1454
01:03:10.550 --> 01:03:12.060
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like in the supermarket.</v>

1455
01:03:12.070 --> 01:03:14.120
<v Speaker 6>And you put your vegetables in those.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1456
01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:15.430
<v Speaker 6>they're supposed to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They will,</v>

1457
01:03:15.431 --> 01:03:16.340
<v Speaker 6>they will,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they will.</v>

1458
01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:20.360
<v Speaker 6>When they go into the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they all actually biodegrade.</v>

1459
01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:24.260
<v Speaker 6>They will become dirt again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>post like a regular plastic bag,</v>

1460
01:03:24.261 --> 01:03:26.850
<v Speaker 6>which probably takes like a fucking</v>
<v Speaker 6>$100,000 company here.</v>

1461
01:03:27.090 --> 01:03:29.780
<v Speaker 6>Then birds,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he didn't die and choke on the plastic</v>

1462
01:03:29.781 --> 01:03:32.300
<v Speaker 6>caps,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but apparently you can make plastic out</v>

1463
01:03:32.301 --> 01:03:36.470
<v Speaker 6>of hemp and it's super easy to make in</v>
<v Speaker 6>terms of like,</v>

1464
01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:39.740
<v Speaker 6>it regrows itself very quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm like,</v>

1465
01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:42.140
<v Speaker 6>if you have a forest and you're trying</v>
<v Speaker 6>to make paper,</v>

1466
01:03:42.290 --> 01:03:42.971
<v Speaker 6>like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're,</v>

1467
01:03:42.971 --> 01:03:44.570
<v Speaker 6>you're trying to make paper out of a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1468
01:03:44.571 --> 01:03:46.760
<v Speaker 6>you have a forest,</v>
<v Speaker 6>timber that you chopped down</v>

1469
01:03:46.761 --> 01:03:49.820
<v Speaker 6>specifically for paper to regrow it to</v>
<v Speaker 6>the point where he could grow paper</v>

1470
01:03:49.821 --> 01:03:50.750
<v Speaker 6>again,</v>
<v Speaker 6>can take years.</v>

1471
01:03:50.990 --> 01:03:52.310
<v Speaker 6>I don't know how many years,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but many years.</v>

1472
01:03:52.610 --> 01:03:55.400
<v Speaker 6>Whereas hemp regrows itself every year.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Really.</v>

1473
01:03:55.550 --> 01:03:56.383
<v Speaker 6>Every year.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1474
01:03:56.810 --> 01:03:57.710
<v Speaker 6>What is this right here?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Jen?</v>

1475
01:03:58.220 --> 01:04:02.180
<v Speaker 6>Edible plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Made out of milk protein for food</v>

1476
01:04:02.181 --> 01:04:03.700
<v Speaker 6>packaging.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Holy Cow.</v>

1477
01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:06.810
<v Speaker 6>Not Vegan.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

1478
01:04:07.910 --> 01:04:09.590
<v Speaker 6>Packaging,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like dairy products and whatnot with it</v>

1479
01:04:09.591 --> 01:04:11.400
<v Speaker 6>at least is what the video shows.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But uh,</v>

1480
01:04:11.810 --> 01:04:12.860
<v Speaker 6>that's fascinating.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Video.</v>

1481
01:04:12.861 --> 01:04:13.880
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like two days ago.</v>

1482
01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:17.000
<v Speaker 6>Well that's certainly something that can</v>
<v Speaker 6>be worked on.</v>

1483
01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:19.600
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the idea of biodegradable plastics would</v>

1484
01:04:19.610 --> 01:04:22.820
<v Speaker 6>be huge.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The that's one of the scariest things is</v>

1485
01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:28.160
<v Speaker 6>that we started making waste and never</v>
<v Speaker 6>had a plan to do with anything,</v>

1486
01:04:28.190 --> 01:04:30.560
<v Speaker 6>do anything with the waste,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then it stacked up to the point</v>

1487
01:04:30.561 --> 01:04:34.220
<v Speaker 6>where we're dealing with enormous</v>
<v Speaker 6>amounts of waste being put up by human</v>

1488
01:04:34.221 --> 01:04:36.420
<v Speaker 6>beings.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Every single second I've ever seen that.</v>

1489
01:04:37.390 --> 01:04:38.980
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was in New York last week,</v>

1490
01:04:39.010 --> 01:04:44.010
<v Speaker 5>just work in the comedy cellar all week</v>
<v Speaker 5>and every night I left the club just on</v>

1491
01:04:44.201 --> 01:04:47.650
<v Speaker 5>Macdougal Street,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just between third and bleaker.</v>

1492
01:04:48.430 --> 01:04:52.990
<v Speaker 5>The amount of garbage that's thrown out</v>
<v Speaker 5>of these restaurants and these juice</v>

1493
01:04:52.991 --> 01:04:55.720
<v Speaker 5>places and coffee places stacked</v>

1494
01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:59.630
<v Speaker 6>just high all the way down the street.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Every single day.</v>

1495
01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:04.220
<v Speaker 6>You see rats Darden in and out of him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A tons of tons of rats.</v>

1496
01:05:05.450 --> 01:05:06.800
<v Speaker 6>They're creepy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

1497
01:05:06.801 --> 01:05:07.790
<v Speaker 6>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We are.</v>

1498
01:05:07.890 --> 01:05:11.960
<v Speaker 6>We are a weird creature man.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's so many of us and we're not</v>

1499
01:05:11.961 --> 01:05:14.480
<v Speaker 6>really thinking about that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you think about how many,</v>

1500
01:05:14.990 --> 01:05:17.590
<v Speaker 6>like on an average day,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how many water bottles you come across</v>

1501
01:05:17.591 --> 01:05:18.424
<v Speaker 6>in La.</v>

1502
01:05:18.770 --> 01:05:20.800
<v Speaker 4>She's like 10 of them here in this room.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know.</v>

1503
01:05:20.801 --> 01:05:23.830
<v Speaker 4>I feel guilty drinking it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got gas this morning.</v>

1504
01:05:23.831 --> 01:05:26.420
<v Speaker 4>I threw a bunch out of my car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I thrown into the garbage.</v>

1505
01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:30.590
<v Speaker 4>That's when I got gas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I threw it at the garbage cans of gas</v>

1506
01:05:30.650 --> 01:05:31.121
<v Speaker 4>station.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1507
01:05:31.121 --> 01:05:32.710
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how many fucking water bottles I have my</v>

1508
01:05:32.711 --> 01:05:35.290
<v Speaker 4>car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy how many times someone had to</v>

1509
01:05:35.291 --> 01:05:38.170
<v Speaker 4>make plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many bottles of plastic are being</v>

1510
01:05:38.171 --> 01:05:40.000
<v Speaker 4>made?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then that plastic has to be in a</v>

1511
01:05:40.001 --> 01:05:41.730
<v Speaker 4>landfill somewhere or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

1512
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:43.780
<v Speaker 4>in the ocean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Giant island in the ocean.</v>

1513
01:05:44.230 --> 01:05:46.420
<v Speaker 4>That big plastic bottle island.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1514
01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:47.770
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's terrible.</v>

1515
01:05:47.830 --> 01:05:50.830
<v Speaker 4>Apparently it's not quite as an island.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They call it an island,</v>

1516
01:05:50.831 --> 01:05:52.570
<v Speaker 4>but it's really just like a floating</v>
<v Speaker 4>patch.</v>

1517
01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:54.880
<v Speaker 4>But it's disgusting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's horrible.</v>

1518
01:05:54.881 --> 01:05:56.920
<v Speaker 4>It's really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we're just seeking out a way to fix</v>

1519
01:05:56.921 --> 01:05:58.720
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's so many people.</v>

1520
01:05:58.790 --> 01:05:59.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just,</v>

1521
01:05:59.921 --> 01:06:04.921
<v Speaker 4>I mean there's so many of us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I'm well for farm to table and like</v>

1522
01:06:05.110 --> 01:06:07.600
<v Speaker 4>knowing where your meat comes from.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get it,</v>

1523
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:09.310
<v Speaker 4>I want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying,</v>

1524
01:06:09.311 --> 01:06:12.910
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when you think about how many people</v>

1525
01:06:12.940 --> 01:06:17.940
<v Speaker 4>are looking for lunch at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>all those mouths looking to feed.</v>

1526
01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:25.500
<v Speaker 4>I mean you need like a Mcdonald's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somebody's got to feed these people.</v>

1527
01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:28.480
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's.</v>

1528
01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:30.520
<v Speaker 4>There's definitely an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

1529
01:06:30.521 --> 01:06:33.520
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if you need a Mcdonald's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you need something.</v>

1530
01:06:33.610 --> 01:06:37.300
<v Speaker 4>You need food and there's 20 plus</v>
<v Speaker 4>million people in this area that aren't</v>

1531
01:06:37.301 --> 01:06:40.330
<v Speaker 4>growing anything other than the</v>
<v Speaker 4>occasional pot plant.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I know you can't do it.</v>

1537
01:06:52.570 --> 01:06:54.670
<v Speaker 4>You can't do it unless you live on a</v>
<v Speaker 4>farm.</v>

1538
01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:56.740
<v Speaker 4>Nobody's growing enough food to live</v>

01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:14.640
<v Speaker 4>There's no way he doesn't because he's</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably out there making stories happen</v>

1627
01:11:14.641 --> 01:11:16.860
<v Speaker 4>to know knowing that he's going to need</v>

<v Speaker 4>It shows me the best shows on comedy</v>

1631
01:11:24.061 --> 01:11:24.960
<v Speaker 4>central.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>

1632
01:11:24.961 --> 01:11:27.210
<v Speaker 4>it's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really hope comedy central never</v>

1633
01:11:27.211 --> 01:11:30.450
<v Speaker 4>cancelled that thing because that's one</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the best shows on comedy,</v>

1634
01:11:30.451 --> 01:11:33.000
<v Speaker 4>central standup shows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There is.</v>

1635
01:11:33.120 --> 01:11:36.690
<v Speaker 4>It really is good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I did it twice and uh,</v>

1636
01:11:37.050 --> 01:11:40.170
<v Speaker 4>I get more hits off of that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then I do like stand up sets.</v>

01:15:50.141 --> 01:15:52.360
<v Speaker 4>own relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do everything together and they're</v>

01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:56.050
<v Speaker 4>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We worked together and we play together.</v>

1729
01:15:56.980 --> 01:15:58.030
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we just get along,</v>

01:15:58.031 --> 01:16:00.000
<v Speaker 4>we finish each other's sentences and</v>
<v Speaker 4>all.</v>

1731

<v Speaker 4>It does happen.</v>

1732
01:16:02.681 --> 01:16:04.150
<v Speaker 4>It does happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hate them.</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's just like they found that</v>

1735
01:16:06.611 --> 01:16:09.610
<v Speaker 4>frequency,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that unique personality frequency,</v>

1736
01:16:09.611 --> 01:16:14.611
<v Speaker 4>because oftentimes your frequency in</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone else's frequencies just off.</v>

1737
01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:16.690
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that doesn't mean you don't love</v>

1738
01:16:16.691 --> 01:16:20.020
<v Speaker 4>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like one person might be the WHO and the</v>

<v Speaker 4>This is the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we both really liked the Beatles.</v>

1743
01:16:27.130 --> 01:16:29.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My only friend.</v>

1744
01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:32.560

<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

1747
01:16:37.301 --> 01:16:41.530

<v Speaker 4>I know what I'm doing in those two</v>

1748
01:16:41.531 --> 01:16:45.250
<v Speaker 4>people are together for 15 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but on his throat,</v>

1749
01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:48.910
<v Speaker 4>it's really interesting when you see</v>
<v Speaker 4>people that are clawing each other's</v>

1750
01:16:48.911 --> 01:16:50.220
<v Speaker 4>throats.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1751
01:16:50.230 --> 01:16:50.771
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1752
01:16:50.771 --> 01:16:53.230
<v Speaker 4>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who would you rather be around the</v>

1753
01:16:53.231 --> 01:16:57.520
<v Speaker 4>couple that's stabbing at each other or</v>
<v Speaker 4>the ideal couple who's making you feel</v>

1754
01:16:57.521 --> 01:17:00.250
<v Speaker 4>like your relationship isn't so great?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The ideal couple for sure.</v>

1755
01:17:00.251 --> 01:17:01.720
<v Speaker 4>I want to be around happy people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1756
01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:04.150
<v Speaker 4>I want to be around people that are</v>
<v Speaker 4>enjoying each other's company.</v>

1757
01:17:04.151 --> 01:17:07.480
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing more frustrating than</v>
<v Speaker 4>being around to people that insult each</v>

1758
01:17:07.481 --> 01:17:09.220
<v Speaker 4>other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like slyly in public.</v>

1759
01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:11.930
<v Speaker 4>It's brutal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We know a couple of apartments.</v>

1760
01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:14.150
<v Speaker 4>Wife used to do that all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

1762
01:17:15.531 --> 01:17:17.060
<v Speaker 4>dead,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when they kill your friend and then</v>

1763
01:17:17.061 --> 01:17:18.710
<v Speaker 4>killed themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think you're allowed to talk shit.</v>

1764
01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:21.330
<v Speaker 4>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's no reverence in the effort of</v>

1765
01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:22.430
<v Speaker 4>the day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Had a very,</v>

1766
01:17:22.431 --> 01:17:25.100
<v Speaker 4>a combative relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but she used to talk shit about him in</v>

1767
01:17:25.101 --> 01:17:26.240
<v Speaker 4>front of us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>

1769
01:17:27.861 --> 01:17:30.920
<v Speaker 4>It was just like she would say he was</v>
<v Speaker 4>old and she would,</v>

1770
01:17:30.950 --> 01:17:32.930
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like one time she's talking about her</v>

1771
01:17:32.931 --> 01:17:34.270
<v Speaker 4>car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There were.</v>

1772

<v Speaker 4>fills a car,</v>

1773
01:17:37.221 --> 01:17:39.620
<v Speaker 4>aficionados loved cars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we were talking about a car.</v>

1774
01:17:40.430 --> 01:17:42.260
<v Speaker 4>I forget what it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then she goes,</v>

1775
01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:44.870
<v Speaker 4>I love pickup trucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want to get a pickup truck.</v>

<v Speaker 4>trucks</v>

1777
01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:52.880
<v Speaker 4>and you just picture and her getting</v>
<v Speaker 4>stuffed in the back of his pickup truck</v>

1778
01:17:52.881 --> 01:17:56.990
<v Speaker 4>by some fucking farmer boy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some dude with thick wrists,</v>

1779
01:17:57.350 --> 01:18:02.330
<v Speaker 4>a catcher's Mitt has just laying his fat</v>
<v Speaker 4>dick because he would take his pants</v>

1780
01:18:02.331 --> 01:18:03.164
<v Speaker 4>off.</v>

1781
01:18:03.220 --> 01:18:05.510
<v Speaker 4>But saying that like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I dunno,</v>

1782
01:18:05.630 --> 01:18:07.250
<v Speaker 4>it's terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just weird.</v>

1783
01:18:07.251 --> 01:18:09.610
<v Speaker 4>It was constantly like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She was always belittling them,</v>

1784
01:18:09.640 --> 01:18:12.650
<v Speaker 4>always tearing them down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would have these horrible fights.</v>

1785
01:18:12.651 --> 01:18:14.360
<v Speaker 4>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never understand that.</v>

1786
01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:17.150
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like it's for the good,</v>

1787
01:18:17.180 --> 01:18:21.290
<v Speaker 4>like his success is your success and yet</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll still tear them down.</v>

1788
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:23.930
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people don't think logically know what</v>

1789
01:18:23.931 --> 01:18:25.790
<v Speaker 4>you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's not a logical thought.</v>

1790
01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:28.850
<v Speaker 4>I mean the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think they just didn't get along</v>

1791
01:18:28.851 --> 01:18:29.870
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1792
01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:35.060
<v Speaker 4>for whatever reason feel was really</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking smart too.</v>

1793
01:18:35.390 --> 01:18:37.760
<v Speaker 4>He was the coolest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a really smart.</v>

1794
01:18:37.761 --> 01:18:39.110
<v Speaker 4>You're so lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to know him.</v>

1795
01:18:39.620 --> 01:18:40.191
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was,</v>

1796
01:18:40.191 --> 01:18:41.540
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

1797
01:18:41.630 --> 01:18:44.390
<v Speaker 4>I mean he would do things like he</v>
<v Speaker 4>learned how to be a pilot,</v>

1798
01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:48.890
<v Speaker 4>so he would be on the set and during the</v>
<v Speaker 4>downtime he be reading aviation books.</v>

1799
01:18:48.930 --> 01:18:51.020
<v Speaker 4>She sit in there reading,</v>
<v Speaker 4>going through him,</v>

1800
01:18:51.021 --> 01:18:54.560
<v Speaker 4>he was the most studious guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>disciplined with his notes.</v>

1801
01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:59.510
<v Speaker 4>He would have his script and each one of</v>
<v Speaker 4>his scenes that he was in would have a</v>

1802
01:18:59.511 --> 01:19:01.210
<v Speaker 4>certain highlight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a,</v>

1803
01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:03.650
<v Speaker 4>like a tab,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a green tab or whatever the color</v>

1804
01:19:03.660 --> 01:19:06.110
<v Speaker 4>tab was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then all of his scenes we'd be</v>

1805
01:19:06.111 --> 01:19:08.180
<v Speaker 4>highlighted,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he'd have notes beside them,</v>

1806
01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:11.720
<v Speaker 4>specific parts of the scene where he</v>
<v Speaker 4>wanted to do something different or</v>

1807
01:19:12.200 --> 01:19:16.310
<v Speaker 4>questioned his intent or go in and he</v>
<v Speaker 4>would just,</v>

1808
01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:20.170
<v Speaker 4>every time he would nail it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>every time he would never use the</v>

1809
01:19:20.240 --> 01:19:24.410
<v Speaker 4>incredibly rare time where he would</v>
<v Speaker 4>crack up during the filming.</v>

1810
01:19:24.910 --> 01:19:26.210
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just having fun.</v>

1811
01:19:26.211 --> 01:19:28.460
<v Speaker 4>If it was never like you fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but he never fucked up.</v>

1812
01:19:28.490 --> 01:19:30.830
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean everybody fucks up and laughs</v>

1813
01:19:30.831 --> 01:19:32.510
<v Speaker 4>when you're not supposed to laugh</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's funny.</v>

1814
01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:34.910
<v Speaker 4>But he was on his game.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was so professional,</v>

1815
01:19:34.911 --> 01:19:37.100
<v Speaker 4>but he was a very,</v>
<v Speaker 4>very,</v>

1840
01:20:27.770 --> 01:20:31.190
<v Speaker 1>but he had like a small plane and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>like freedom you have when you have a</v>

1841
01:20:31.191 --> 01:20:33.980
<v Speaker 1>plain man you ever want to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fly Yourself?</v>

1842
01:20:34.010 --> 01:20:36.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But weird way to go when you know this</v>

1843
01:20:36.531 --> 01:20:39.200
<v Speaker 1>fucking planes dying on you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had cars die on me.</v>

1844
01:20:39.270 --> 01:20:40.103
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1845
01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:43.360
<v Speaker 1>I know the mechanical end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you in mechanical or you?</v>

1846
01:20:43.370 --> 01:20:45.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1847
01:20:45.201 --> 01:20:48.650
<v Speaker 1>I know certain things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's like someone saying,</v>

1848
01:20:48.651 --> 01:20:50.000
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took karate when I was 14.</v>

1849
01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:54.050
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ran my own stereo in my Toyota</v>

1850
01:20:54.051 --> 01:20:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Corolla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did that.</v>

1851
01:20:55.660 --> 01:20:57.470
<v Speaker 1>But I wouldn't tell you that I could</v>
<v Speaker 1>install stereos.</v>

1852
01:20:57.471 --> 01:20:58.340
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1853
01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:01.250
<v Speaker 1>I know a little bit about cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I love them.</v>

1854
01:21:01.550 --> 01:21:02.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do too.</v>

1855
01:21:02.511 --> 01:21:04.000
<v Speaker 1>But that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like A.</v>

1856
01:21:04.430 --> 01:21:07.920
<v Speaker 1>I feel like if you're gonna have your</v>
<v Speaker 1>own plane and you gotta be you gotTa</v>

1857
01:21:07.921 --> 01:21:09.920
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really knowledgeable and on top of it</v>

1858
01:21:09.921 --> 01:21:13.580
<v Speaker 1>and you gotta know your limits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's kind of my limit.</v>

1859
01:21:13.850 --> 01:21:14.810
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was intense,</v>

1860
01:21:14.811 --> 01:21:16.820
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The landing was intense because was a</v>

1861
01:21:16.821 --> 01:21:19.960
<v Speaker 1>little tiny plane man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a little two seater plane so it</v>

1862
01:21:19.961 --> 01:21:23.090
<v Speaker 1>was just me and fell and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're coming into this land named white</v>

1863
01:21:23.091 --> 01:21:24.170
<v Speaker 1>cheeses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's right there.</v>

1864
01:21:24.171 --> 01:21:26.870
<v Speaker 1>Like the grounds right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy.</v>

1865
01:21:26.871 --> 01:21:30.080
<v Speaker 1>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a small plane and knowing that it's</v>

1866
01:21:30.081 --> 01:21:33.320
<v Speaker 1>like you're goofy friend from the set</v>
<v Speaker 1>taking you in.</v>

1867
01:21:33.410 --> 01:21:35.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was always like an older brother to</v>

1868
01:21:35.961 --> 01:21:37.130
<v Speaker 1>me was in the set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1869
01:21:37.131 --> 01:21:38.900
<v Speaker 1>because he was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was older than me.</v>

1870
01:21:39.620 --> 01:21:40.453
<v Speaker 1>Varianced</v>

1871
01:21:41.900 --> 01:21:44.790
<v Speaker 6>like at least 16 years older,</v>
<v Speaker 6>maybe more,</v>

1872
01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:48.300
<v Speaker 6>maybe 17,</v>
<v Speaker 6>18 years old or something like that.</v>

1873
01:21:48.390 --> 01:21:51.700
<v Speaker 6>And he was a star already right when he</v>
<v Speaker 6>was us,</v>

1874
01:21:52.770 --> 01:21:56.760
<v Speaker 6>like when we were on the set,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he is in movies all the time,</v>

1875
01:21:56.761 --> 01:21:58.690
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he was just getting off a Saturday night</v>

1876
01:21:58.691 --> 01:22:01.080
<v Speaker 6>live and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

1877
01:22:01.130 --> 01:22:05.730
<v Speaker 6>and then of course Dave Foley was a big</v>
<v Speaker 6>star from kids in the hall and he was a</v>

1878
01:22:05.731 --> 01:22:09.870
<v Speaker 6>big alternative star to like everybody</v>
<v Speaker 6>loved him because he was so smart and</v>

1879
01:22:09.871 --> 01:22:12.690
<v Speaker 6>the writing was so good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then Andy Dick was like a known</v>

1880
01:22:12.691 --> 01:22:16.200
<v Speaker 6>Weirdo and so it was,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was a fascinating little grey.</v>

1881
01:22:16.350 --> 01:22:17.440
<v Speaker 6>Bruce,</v>
<v Speaker 6>every</v>

1882
01:22:17.450 --> 01:22:20.790
<v Speaker 1>crew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember spending a whole summer just</v>

1883
01:22:20.791 --> 01:22:25.791
<v Speaker 1>watching fills best of snl disc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the funny and stuff that wasn't even a</v>

1884
01:22:27.331 --> 01:22:30.000
<v Speaker 1>hit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like him playing the acting teacher.</v>

1885
01:22:31.250 --> 01:22:35.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean I in a loop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could not stop watching it.</v>

1886
01:22:35.191 --> 01:22:36.630
<v Speaker 1>He was so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is something,</v>

1887
01:22:36.900 --> 01:22:38.400
<v Speaker 1>this is nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is something,</v>

1888
01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:42.570
<v Speaker 1>this is nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he would like somebody like</v>

1889
01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:44.580
<v Speaker 1>Sarah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can I get out of my class?</v>

1890
01:22:45.780 --> 01:22:49.170
<v Speaker 1>It was on the money 100 percent of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1891
01:22:49.260 --> 01:22:50.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1892
01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:54.340
<v Speaker 1>He stand up to for the audience for fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

1893
01:22:54.390 --> 01:22:56.440
<v Speaker 1>It would warm up the crowd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really,</v>

1894
01:22:56.441 --> 01:22:57.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was like putting together almost like</v>

1895
01:22:57.931 --> 01:23:00.990
<v Speaker 1>a little routine that he would do well</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we talked about is like,</v>

1896
01:23:00.991 --> 01:23:02.130
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think I'm going to go on stage</v>

1897
01:23:02.140 --> 01:23:03.240
<v Speaker 1>someday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1898
01:23:03.330 --> 01:23:04.950
<v Speaker 1>He just never.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think he ever really did it</v>

1899
01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:06.160
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he could have easily</v>

1900
01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:09.160
<v Speaker 4>done it and his wife just got dale.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey Man.</v>

1901
01:23:09.161 --> 01:23:10.390
<v Speaker 4>She was troubled,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1902
01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:14.200
<v Speaker 4>choose a troubled person.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And she was also on Zoloft and cocaine.</v>

1903
01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:16.510
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which apparently leads to psychotic</v>

1904
01:23:16.511 --> 01:23:20.620
<v Speaker 4>thoughts and it's apparently a very bad</v>
<v Speaker 4>combination,</v>

1905
01:23:20.650 --> 01:23:25.090
<v Speaker 4>especially for some people which people</v>
<v Speaker 4>have their own particular sort of human</v>

1906
01:23:25.091 --> 01:23:28.480
<v Speaker 4>neurochemistry they got going on up</v>
<v Speaker 4>there and with some people when they do</v>

1907
01:23:28.481 --> 01:23:31.990
<v Speaker 4>coke and Zoloft together,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just makes them insane.</v>

1908
01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:34.800
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the real,</v>

1909
01:23:34.801 --> 01:23:39.801
<v Speaker 4>one of the real losses as a fan of his</v>
<v Speaker 4>is that he was the kind of guy that the</v>

1910
01:23:40.241 --> 01:23:42.130
<v Speaker 4>older he got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the better he would become.</v>

1911
01:23:42.580 --> 01:23:44.920
<v Speaker 4>He was playing guys who were older than</v>
<v Speaker 4>him.</v>

1912
01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:48.010
<v Speaker 4>He had that very fatherly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>intelligent,</v>

1913
01:23:48.011 --> 01:23:49.870
<v Speaker 4>older kind of vibe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyway.</v>

1914
01:23:50.250 --> 01:23:52.600
<v Speaker 4>So it's as a 75,</v>
<v Speaker 4>80 year old,</v>

1915
01:23:52.601 --> 01:23:54.520
<v Speaker 4>he would still be killing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1916
01:23:54.521 --> 01:23:55.490
<v Speaker 4>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1917
01:23:55.870 --> 01:23:59.080
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a million different</v>
<v Speaker 4>kinds of tragedies with the big one is</v>

1918
01:23:59.081 --> 01:24:03.070
<v Speaker 4>those kids had to deal with the fact</v>
<v Speaker 4>that mom killed them and then killed</v>

1919
01:24:03.071 --> 01:24:03.700
<v Speaker 4>herself.</v>

1920
01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:04.670
<v Speaker 4>How many?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two,</v>

1921
01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:07.510
<v Speaker 4>two kids.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then they went and lived with family</v>

1922
01:24:07.511 --> 01:24:08.740
<v Speaker 4>afterwards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just the whole thing.</v>

1923
01:24:08.741 --> 01:24:10.600
<v Speaker 4>So dark.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so sad.</v>

1924
01:24:10.930 --> 01:24:12.880
<v Speaker 4>It is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man is the worst.</v>

1925
01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:14.510
<v Speaker 4>But I mean it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

1926
01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:18.670
<v Speaker 4>it was also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just more evidence of what happens</v>

1927
01:24:18.970 --> 01:24:22.530
<v Speaker 4>when people are in those combative</v>
<v Speaker 4>relationships and they just don't know,</v>

1928
01:24:22.610 --> 01:24:23.860
<v Speaker 4>don't Gel together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1929
01:24:23.861 --> 01:24:25.130
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have somebody look,</v>

1930
01:24:25.180 --> 01:24:29.090
<v Speaker 4>if you've ever been around like just a</v>
<v Speaker 4>toxic person and it's like just one on</v>

1931
01:24:29.091 --> 01:24:29.760
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You leave,</v>

1932
01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:32.860
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's an energy that just drains you.</v>

1933
01:24:33.100 --> 01:24:35.140
<v Speaker 4>And then imagine living with that</v>
<v Speaker 4>person.</v>

1934
01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:36.700
<v Speaker 4>It's guest.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's got.</v>

1935
01:24:36.701 --> 01:24:38.120
<v Speaker 4>It's too much work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1936
01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:39.760
<v Speaker 4>Too much work.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you know,</v>

1937
01:24:40.450 --> 01:24:42.820
<v Speaker 4>he ever dated somebody who was really</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of toxic.</v>

1938
01:24:42.821 --> 01:24:44.710
<v Speaker 4>It's kind of exciting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At the same time.</v>

1939
01:24:44.970 --> 01:24:48.100
<v Speaker 4>Time's the freaky ones are the most fun</v>
<v Speaker 4>in bed.</v>

1940
01:24:48.810 --> 01:24:49.930
<v Speaker 4>Really crazy ones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1941
01:24:49.931 --> 01:24:51.910
<v Speaker 4>It gets a little crazy sometimes.</v>

1942
01:24:52.030 --> 01:24:55.300
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes when you're young too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes those breakup makeup fights</v>

1943
01:24:55.301 --> 01:24:56.500
<v Speaker 4>are awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1944
01:24:56.550 --> 01:24:57.910
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when they come back you didn't think</v>

1945
01:24:57.911 --> 01:24:59.590
<v Speaker 4>they were coming back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And next thing you know you're making</v>

1946
01:24:59.600 --> 01:25:02.690
<v Speaker 4>out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's crazy when you hear the cops.</v>

1947
01:25:02.740 --> 01:25:04.030
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what the fuck do you call the cops?</v>

1948
01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:06.340
<v Speaker 4>Call them before I knew we were getting</v>
<v Speaker 4>back together.</v>

1949
01:25:06.910 --> 01:25:08.200
<v Speaker 4>Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're okay.</v>

1950
01:25:08.201 --> 01:25:09.460
<v Speaker 4>You're to escape.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1951
01:25:09.461 --> 01:25:10.810
<v Speaker 4>it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're all right now.</v>

1952
01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:12.350
<v Speaker 4>Just write an argument.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're lazy.</v>

1953
01:25:12.380 --> 01:25:15.700
<v Speaker 4>Get on the roof.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw a house on fire yesterday.</v>

1954
01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:16.840
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1955
01:25:16.841 --> 01:25:20.980
<v Speaker 4>Like up the street from me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A whole like a house ablaze of the roof</v>

1956
01:25:20.981 --> 01:25:25.090
<v Speaker 4>was ablaze and it was up in the hills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they had two bad.</v>

1957
01:25:25.220 --> 01:25:26.830
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To get the fire trucks up there.</v>

1958
01:25:26.831 --> 01:25:28.870
<v Speaker 4>But then they stopped it like it's still</v>
<v Speaker 4>standing today.</v>

1959
01:25:28.871 --> 01:25:32.710
<v Speaker 4>But the roof is all,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I've never seen like a whole house</v>

1960
01:25:32.711 --> 01:25:34.210
<v Speaker 4>on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dude.</v>

1961
01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:36.970
<v Speaker 4>I saw an entire,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have to outdo you</v>

1962
01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:43.780
<v Speaker 4>have oprah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She used to like outdo people.</v>

1963
01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:45.980
<v Speaker 4>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I was um,</v>

1964
01:25:46.270 --> 01:25:50.800
<v Speaker 4>working,</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing fear factor in like 2003,</v>

1965
01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:54.190
<v Speaker 4>it was 2002 or three when they had that</v>
<v Speaker 4>giant fire,</v>

1966
01:25:54.490 --> 01:25:59.490
<v Speaker 4>there was a joy and fire.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like on the way towards</v>

1967
01:26:00.150 --> 01:26:03.980
<v Speaker 4>Bakersfield up the five.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And we were filming up there at</v>

1968
01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:07.010
<v Speaker 6>the home ranch.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was a lake and we were dropping</v>

1969
01:26:07.011 --> 01:26:09.140
<v Speaker 6>these people off from helicopters to the</v>
<v Speaker 6>lake.</v>

1970
01:26:09.260 --> 01:26:14.260
<v Speaker 6>And normally without traffic it's about</v>
<v Speaker 6>an hour 20 drive our half drive to la</v>

1971
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:17.300
<v Speaker 6>from,</v>
<v Speaker 6>from ranch.</v>

1972
01:26:17.750 --> 01:26:21.800
<v Speaker 6>But this day it was bumper to bumper.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

1973
01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:26.300
<v Speaker 6>a guy died,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a guy ran out and got hit by a car and I</v>

1974
01:26:26.301 --> 01:26:31.280
<v Speaker 6>saw a sneaker and I saw him laying on</v>
<v Speaker 6>the side of the road like briefly as I</v>

1975
01:26:31.281 --> 01:26:34.240
<v Speaker 6>was passing while people were trying to</v>
<v Speaker 6>attend to him and I,</v>

1976
01:26:34.241 --> 01:26:35.074
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I didn't,</v>

1977
01:26:35.180 --> 01:26:37.460
<v Speaker 6>I didn't like see his head splattered or</v>
<v Speaker 6>anything like that.</v>

1978
01:26:37.461 --> 01:26:41.210
<v Speaker 6>But I saw his leg.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then my friend Matt told me that guy</v>

1979
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:42.910
<v Speaker 6>ended up dying.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And uh,</v>

1980
01:26:42.920 --> 01:26:45.830
<v Speaker 6>so that was the beginning of this eerie</v>
<v Speaker 6>drive home.</v>

1981
01:26:45.831 --> 01:26:50.390
<v Speaker 6>Then as we got closer to la,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it was literally snowing,</v>

1982
01:26:50.391 --> 01:26:55.100
<v Speaker 6>ashes and the entire right side of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>highway was ablaze.</v>

1983
01:26:55.130 --> 01:26:58.410
<v Speaker 6>She as far I'm talking like a mile in</v>
<v Speaker 6>whom?</v>

1984
01:26:58.450 --> 01:27:01.700
<v Speaker 6>Like as far as the eye could see,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it looked like the fucking Lord of the</v>

1985
01:27:01.701 --> 01:27:02.570
<v Speaker 6>rings.</v>
<v Speaker 6>She was like,</v>

1986
01:27:02.571 --> 01:27:07.571
<v Speaker 6>I was waiting for demon horses to come</v>
<v Speaker 6>riding over the top and crazy high.</v>

1987
01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:11.660
<v Speaker 6>Like it was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was tornadoes,</v>

1988
01:27:11.661 --> 01:27:14.060
<v Speaker 6>a fire,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it was fucking fire everywhere</v>

1989
01:27:14.090 --> 01:27:15.950
<v Speaker 6>and you're in traffic at that point were</v>
<v Speaker 6>in traffic.</v>

1990
01:27:15.951 --> 01:27:18.740
<v Speaker 6>So you're just sitting there really</v>
<v Speaker 6>removed from it by a patch of grass,</v>

1991
01:27:18.770 --> 01:27:21.500
<v Speaker 6>a bunch of asphalt.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And I'm telling you man,</v>

1992
01:27:21.501 --> 01:27:25.190
<v Speaker 6>I'm not bullshitting that side of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>road was like that for an hour,</v>

1993
01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:29.180
<v Speaker 6>hour of driving.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like the whole right side was like fire.</v>

1994
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:31.880
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That's when we were coming from the</v>

1997
01:27:38.271 --> 01:27:40.910
<v Speaker 6>like over the crest of the hill over</v>
<v Speaker 6>near the 1:18,</v>

1998
01:27:41.070 --> 01:27:44.390
<v Speaker 6>the Simi Valley area ablaze ablaze.</v>

1999

2042
01:29:24.810 --> 01:29:27.210
<v Speaker 1>but where do you want to be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to be somewhere?</v>

2043
01:29:27.211 --> 01:29:29.160
<v Speaker 1>You don't want to be a prepper right</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2044
01:29:29.190 --> 01:29:32.610
<v Speaker 1>She don't want to be the guy who dies of</v>
<v Speaker 1>starvation because he can't figure out</v>

2045
01:29:32.611 --> 01:29:35.830
<v Speaker 1>how to get by now you will be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You want a couple?</v>

2046
01:29:36.090 --> 01:29:40.890
<v Speaker 1>You want to try your best?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to be rick from the walking</v>

2047
01:29:40.891 --> 01:29:41.460
<v Speaker 1>dead?</v>

2048
01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:44.160
<v Speaker 1>It goes through several seasons of</v>
<v Speaker 1>horrific events.</v>

2049
01:29:44.580 --> 01:29:45.750
<v Speaker 1>Basically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shattered man,</v>

2050
01:29:45.751 --> 01:29:49.530
<v Speaker 1>by the time I abandoned the show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or do you want to be one of the people</v>

2051
01:29:49.531 --> 01:29:51.420
<v Speaker 1>that gets killed early on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it's to wrap.</v>

2052
01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:54.690
<v Speaker 1>I probably go somewhere in between.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Get a little adventure,</v>

2053
01:29:55.050 --> 01:29:57.960
<v Speaker 1>meet some new people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make some mistakes.</v>

2054
01:29:57.990 --> 01:30:00.000
<v Speaker 1>You think you got it together and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wacko,</v>

2055
01:30:00.270 --> 01:30:04.080
<v Speaker 1>but isn't like the walking dead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate existential crisis because</v>

2056
01:30:04.081 --> 01:30:06.540
<v Speaker 1>if you do die,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to come back as a Zombie.</v>

2057
01:30:07.890 --> 01:30:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the only thing that can free you</v>

2058
01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:11.550
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess if you shoot yourself in the</v>

2059
01:30:11.551 --> 01:30:12.510
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2060
01:30:12.511 --> 01:30:15.030
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to shoot yourself in the head</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if you shoot a Zombie in the</v>

2061
01:30:15.031 --> 01:30:16.200
<v Speaker 1>head,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just stopped being a Zombie</v>

2062
01:30:16.201 --> 01:30:17.250
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somehow or another,</v>

2063
01:30:17.251 --> 01:30:19.260
<v Speaker 1>there's a little button,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2064
01:30:19.261 --> 01:30:22.920
<v Speaker 1>I feel like they're getting very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a wishy washy with the Zombie rules</v>

2065
01:30:22.921 --> 01:30:23.754
<v Speaker 1>lately.</v>

2066
01:30:23.790 --> 01:30:25.400
<v Speaker 1>I don't watch it anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

2067
01:30:25.410 --> 01:30:29.760
<v Speaker 1>Either I watched live zombies definitely</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't consistent in their ability to</v>

<v Speaker 1>horses and now they can,</v>

2070
01:30:33.781 --> 01:30:35.190
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can just push them aside,</v>

<v Speaker 1>bones?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what's going on because they're not</v>

<v Speaker 1>able to open up the road coming from the</v>

2099
01:31:44.401 --> 01:31:47.460
<v Speaker 1>going to be able to do it is to just</v>
<v Speaker 1>build on the landslide.</v>

2100
01:31:47.490 --> 01:31:50.970
<v Speaker 1>It's that much dirt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More than a million tons of rock and</v>

<v Speaker 4>The highway.</v>

2140
01:33:30.180 --> 01:33:30.760
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

2141
01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:33.910
<v Speaker 4>Snakes around the California coastline</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a major tourist destination.</v>

2142
01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:36.610
<v Speaker 4>Cruz called the landslide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One of a kind,</v>

2143
01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:38.320
<v Speaker 4>but it happened like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a,</v>

2144
01:33:38.590 --> 01:33:41.230
<v Speaker 4>like a month ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then there's just like last</v>

2145
01:33:41.230 --> 01:33:42.580
<v Speaker 4>Saturday,</v>
<v Speaker 4>another chunk just went.</v>

2146
01:33:43.060 --> 01:33:44.830
<v Speaker 4>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's still in motion.</v>

2147
01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:45.431
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

2148
01:33:45.431 --> 01:33:46.970
<v Speaker 4>That's what keeps me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Things like that.</v>

2149
01:33:46.971 --> 01:33:48.610
<v Speaker 4>And what keeps me from living on the</v>
<v Speaker 4>ocean.</v>

2150
01:33:48.670 --> 01:33:51.510
<v Speaker 4>I know I rented a house in Malibu and</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2151
01:33:51.511 --> 01:33:55.240
<v Speaker 4>one time I got super baked in and I went</v>
<v Speaker 4>down to the bottom floor.</v>

2152
01:33:55.450 --> 01:33:56.830
<v Speaker 4>I was only in this house for like three</v>
<v Speaker 4>months,</v>

2153
01:33:57.040 --> 01:33:57.820
<v Speaker 4>but it was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>

2154
01:33:57.820 --> 01:34:02.110
<v Speaker 4>it was the bottom floor bedroom was the</v>
<v Speaker 4>water would literally go under it.</v>

2155
01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:05.290
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And at night time it's fucking</v>

2156
01:34:05.291 --> 01:34:08.410
<v Speaker 4>horrifying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's scary in the daytime it's gorgeous</v>

2157
01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:11.500
<v Speaker 4>looking out and you see that blue water</v>
<v Speaker 4>and so inviting.</v>

2158
01:34:11.740 --> 01:34:15.250
<v Speaker 4>But at nighttime dot water is dark,</v>
<v Speaker 4>sky is black.</v>

2159
01:34:15.250 --> 01:34:16.570
<v Speaker 4>And you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my God.</v>

2160
01:34:16.930 --> 01:34:19.420
<v Speaker 4>He'd like shows you what it really is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2161
01:34:19.421 --> 01:34:22.810
<v Speaker 4>the ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're essentially at the whim of this</v>

2162
01:34:22.811 --> 01:34:25.660
<v Speaker 4>everchanging.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See you are riding on a gamble.</v>

2163
01:34:25.820 --> 01:34:28.810
<v Speaker 4>And that gamble is what are the odds</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's going to shift?</v>

2164
01:34:28.811 --> 01:34:30.340
<v Speaker 4>Now you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to shift eventually.</v>

2165
01:34:30.341 --> 01:34:32.350
<v Speaker 4>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This house is probably worth like</v>

2166
01:34:32.351 --> 01:34:35.500
<v Speaker 4>millions of dollars and it's just</v>
<v Speaker 4>sitting on this water crazy.</v>

2167
01:34:35.620 --> 01:34:38.590
<v Speaker 4>You don't even have a front yard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your backyard is the ocean.</v>

2168
01:34:38.740 --> 01:34:39.590
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

2169
01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:41.940
<v Speaker 4>my cousin has a place down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2170
01:34:42.100 --> 01:34:46.210
<v Speaker 4>down towards San Diego and all these</v>
<v Speaker 4>beautiful multimillion dollar homes on</v>

2171
01:34:46.211 --> 01:34:48.880
<v Speaker 4>this cliff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they just keep shoring up the cliff,</v>

2172
01:34:48.910 --> 01:34:53.910
<v Speaker 4>they just keep putting in new planks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>got concrete rivet and they're just</v>

2173
01:34:54.190 --> 01:34:57.860
<v Speaker 4>hanging on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like someone some days in this</v>

2174
01:34:57.861 --> 01:35:00.540
<v Speaker 4>habit of mind when it goes down because</v>
<v Speaker 4>people,</v>

<v Speaker 4>it's just you and the ocean.</v>

2177
01:35:05.260 --> 01:35:09.050
<v Speaker 4>It is pretty spectacular.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It might be worth sliding and eventually</v>

2178
01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:14.760
<v Speaker 4>you have to have is super baller money.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you have that house on the coast and</v>

2179
01:35:15.051 --> 01:35:18.470
<v Speaker 4>then you have a house somewhere else or</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't have a family and you're just</v>

2180
01:35:18.471 --> 01:35:19.940
<v Speaker 4>a dude with a surf board and you're</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

<v Speaker 4>It's a nice little hang.</v>

2233
01:37:23.810 --> 01:37:26.740
<v Speaker 4>You want to get away from the club for a</v>

01:39:38.751 --> 01:39:40.460
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially in the early days with they</v>

2282
01:39:40.461 --> 01:39:44.470
<v Speaker 4>like say a bunch of things in a row and</v>
<v Speaker 4>then memorize it and the audience will</v>

2283
01:39:44.560 --> 01:39:47.990

2289
01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:05.380
<v Speaker 4>everybody beat in the 19 eighties</v>
<v Speaker 4>because people would go to see him and</v>

2290
01:40:05.381 --> 01:40:09.830
<v Speaker 4>it would repeat his lines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They wanted to hear what's in the bowl.</v>

2291
01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:13.760
<v Speaker 4>The whole audience do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just like a fucking rock concert.</v>

2292
01:40:13.770 --> 01:40:15.350
<v Speaker 4>Hazy that you can't.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2294
01:40:17.420 --> 01:40:18.290
<v Speaker 4>Can't replicate.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2295
01:40:18.310 --> 01:40:23.240
<v Speaker 4>I mean dice had something that was</v>
<v Speaker 4>different because they were going to see</v>

2296
01:40:23.241 --> 01:40:25.700
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They already knew that he would go.</v>

2297
01:40:25.701 --> 01:40:30.470
<v Speaker 4>I'll go rick dog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Crazy.</v>

2298
01:40:32.270 --> 01:40:35.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm still weirded out when I hang out</v>
<v Speaker 4>with dice still to this day.</v>

2299
01:40:35.620 --> 01:40:36.920
<v Speaker 4>He was a rockstar.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2300
01:40:36.921 --> 01:40:38.420
<v Speaker 4>when I'm in the room with them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I weared out.</v>

2301
01:40:38.450 --> 01:40:39.380
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't even believe that.</v>

2302
01:40:39.390 --> 01:40:40.310
<v Speaker 4>Dice Clay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2303
01:40:40.311 --> 01:40:41.760
<v Speaker 4>it's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was.</v>

2304
01:40:41.780 --> 01:40:44.450
<v Speaker 4>Now he was so big and my girlfriend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were 19.</v>

2305
01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:48.230
<v Speaker 4>We're sitting in my car.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was dating this hot Nicaraguan girl.</v>

2306
01:40:48.470 --> 01:40:50.510
<v Speaker 4>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She had a great sense of humors.</v>

2307
01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:53.620
<v Speaker 4>Hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But we're sitting in my car listening to</v>

2308
01:40:53.621 --> 01:40:55.390
<v Speaker 4>this fucking dice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Clay tape.</v>

2309
01:40:55.391 --> 01:40:57.350
<v Speaker 4>Just house crying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>laughing.</v>

2310
01:40:57.970 --> 01:41:01.510
<v Speaker 4>It was so stupid because when you're 19,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that is like the perfect kind of comedy</v>

2311
01:41:01.511 --> 01:41:02.740
<v Speaker 4>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh God,</v>

2312
01:41:02.741 --> 01:41:04.660
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just on a tough fit.</v>

2313
01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:12.200
<v Speaker 4>Little boy blue.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you ever see him do a long setback</v>

2314
01:41:15.191 --> 01:41:16.024
<v Speaker 4>then?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was it?</v>

2315
01:41:16.270 --> 01:41:17.920
<v Speaker 4>I only saw like short sets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2316
01:41:17.930 --> 01:41:22.930
<v Speaker 4>like I went to see him live.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I saw him a couple of times and then I</v>

2317
01:41:25.001 --> 01:41:26.980
<v Speaker 4>saw him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would he do that?</v>

2318
01:41:26.981 --> 01:41:31.270
<v Speaker 4>The hallway I saw in the store a lot in</v>
<v Speaker 4>the nineties when it was just sort of</v>

2319
01:41:31.271 --> 01:41:33.490
<v Speaker 4>fucking around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But when he would come to the store,</v>

2320
01:41:33.491 --> 01:41:35.680
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't like a set,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a concert set.</v>

2321
01:41:36.030 --> 01:41:37.990
<v Speaker 4>It was like he was working on new</v>
<v Speaker 4>material.</v>

2322
01:41:37.991 --> 01:41:42.700
<v Speaker 4>He was fucking around just just working</v>
<v Speaker 4>out when we do long sets.</v>

2323
01:41:42.850 --> 01:41:44.800
<v Speaker 4>I mean everyone was waiting for the</v>
<v Speaker 4>nursery rhymes.</v>

2324
01:41:44.820 --> 01:41:47.140
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she still does nursery rhyme stuff.</v>

2325
01:41:47.410 --> 01:41:51.670
<v Speaker 4>I saw him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>me and Jim Norton and Anthony Kumi.</v>

2326
01:41:51.671 --> 01:41:53.700
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and who the fuck else was it?</v>

2327
01:41:53.890 --> 01:41:58.890
<v Speaker 4>I think Bobby Kelly and red band went to</v>
<v Speaker 4>see him in Vegas at the Riviera.</v>

2328
01:41:59.650 --> 01:42:01.420
<v Speaker 4>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Which is just recently.</v>

2329
01:42:01.510 --> 01:42:03.580
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>obviously the Riviera is dead now.</v>

2330
01:42:03.590 --> 01:42:05.900
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it was probably five years ago.</v>

2331
01:42:05.901 --> 01:42:07.270
<v Speaker 4>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe a little more,</v>

2332
01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:08.320
<v Speaker 4>but God,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dan,</v>

2333
01:42:08.321 --> 01:42:10.570
<v Speaker 4>we had a great time when I saw the whole</v>
<v Speaker 4>set.</v>

2334
01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:14.380
<v Speaker 4>I saw his whole set and it was great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's great.</v>

2335
01:42:14.740 --> 01:42:18.780
<v Speaker 4>He was a monster dude.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He was a killer and human.</v>

2336
01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:19.930
<v Speaker 4>The Woody Allen Movie,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure.</v>

2337
01:42:19.931 --> 01:42:20.890
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was really good.</v>

2338
01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:22.570
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>really good.</v>

2339
01:42:23.050 --> 01:42:24.760
<v Speaker 4>That Woody Allen movie weirds me out</v>
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>

2340
01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:30.430
<v Speaker 4>That was movies all weird me out now</v>
<v Speaker 4>because it's so crazy because of the guy</v>

2341
01:42:30.460 --> 01:42:31.840
<v Speaker 4>because of who he is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who he is.</v>

2342
01:42:31.841 --> 01:42:32.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2343
01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:37.180
<v Speaker 4>I think he's still a brilliant director</v>
<v Speaker 4>and a great screenwriter,</v>

2344
01:42:37.630 --> 01:42:38.980
<v Speaker 4>but it's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you almost.</v>

2345
01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:42.430
<v Speaker 4>There's certain things you expect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>

2346
01:42:42.440 --> 01:42:44.530
<v Speaker 4>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he got hooked on pills that happens.</v>

2347
01:42:44.980 --> 01:42:47.110
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is a boozer happens.</v>

2348
01:42:48.250 --> 01:42:50.350
<v Speaker 4>It turns out he was gay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Happens.</v>

2349
01:42:50.940 --> 01:42:52.240
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's fucking his daughter.</v>

2350
01:42:53.080 --> 01:42:53.970
<v Speaker 4>That happened.</v>

2351
01:42:56.910 --> 01:42:59.180
<v Speaker 4>How old was she when he met her?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2352
01:42:59.260 --> 01:43:01.360
<v Speaker 4>she was too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2353
01:43:02.230 --> 01:43:03.880
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's that great.</v>

2354
01:43:04.350 --> 01:43:08.160
<v Speaker 4>A great joke by Emo Philips,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the</v>

2355
01:43:09.670 --> 01:43:13.530
<v Speaker 4>Woody Allen adopted Sunni when she was</v>
<v Speaker 4>four years old,</v>

2356
01:43:14.800 --> 01:43:19.800
<v Speaker 4>started dating her when she was 15.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Patience of a saint.</v>

2357
01:43:23.740 --> 01:43:26.020
<v Speaker 4>Is that what he did?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He started dating when she was 15.</v>

2358
01:43:26.021 --> 01:43:29.380
<v Speaker 4>Is that right there like that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know Christ,</v>

2359
01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:31.840
<v Speaker 4>but you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you find out anything about an artist.</v>

2360
01:43:31.841 --> 01:43:33.370
<v Speaker 4>You're gonna Mount Lake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

2361
01:43:33.371 --> 01:43:34.900
<v Speaker 4>But here's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>here's the question again.</v>

2362
01:43:34.901 --> 01:43:36.070
<v Speaker 4>Is it me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it me?</v>

2363
01:43:36.071 --> 01:43:39.460
<v Speaker 4>Is it the same thing about my friend</v>
<v Speaker 4>jerking off his dog with his foot?</v>

2364
01:43:39.820 --> 01:43:41.560
<v Speaker 4>Is it just on me?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2365
01:43:41.561 --> 01:43:43.720
<v Speaker 4>what if.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it sounds gross,</v>

2366
01:43:43.930 --> 01:43:48.760
<v Speaker 4>but what if after all those years they</v>
<v Speaker 4>really were in love with each other?</v>

2367
01:43:48.850 --> 01:43:51.410
<v Speaker 4>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It seems like it now,</v>

2368
01:43:51.411 --> 01:43:51.861
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

2369
01:43:51.861 --> 01:43:52.040
<v Speaker 4>he's</v>

2370
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:55.250
<v Speaker 1>an old man and they're stolen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're still in love and hanging out.</v>

2371
01:43:55.251 --> 01:43:58.160
<v Speaker 1>And is that unacceptable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

2372
01:43:58.310 --> 01:44:00.080
<v Speaker 1>It's unacceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If people get hurt,</v>

2373
01:44:00.140 --> 01:44:02.180
<v Speaker 1>no one got hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't.</v>

2374
01:44:02.181 --> 01:44:03.014
<v Speaker 1>Do you what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2375
01:44:03.340 --> 01:44:05.630
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of pictures before and</v>
<v Speaker 1>after.</v>

2376
01:44:05.660 --> 01:44:07.030
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I heard some of these are.</v>

2377
01:44:07.190 --> 01:44:11.660
<v Speaker 1>I heard there was some</v>
<v Speaker 1>weirdness and some of the weirdness</v>

2378
01:44:11.661 --> 01:44:13.790
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a little girl and he's with her</v>

2379
01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:16.340
<v Speaker 1>and then he wound up marrying her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's weird,</v>

2380
01:44:16.341 --> 01:44:18.350
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just weird.</v>

2381
01:44:18.630 --> 01:44:20.750
<v Speaker 1>It really didn't make her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he will look.</v>

2382
01:44:20.780 --> 01:44:24.230
<v Speaker 1>He's not arrested and he's not in jail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not right.</v>

2383
01:44:24.231 --> 01:44:27.170
<v Speaker 1>And it didn't everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't there a case.</v>

2384
01:44:27.171 --> 01:44:28.790
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't they investigate and find him,</v>

2385
01:44:28.850 --> 01:44:31.040
<v Speaker 1>find him innocent of all this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

2386
01:44:31.041 --> 01:44:33.710
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the problem with the problem with</v>

2387
01:44:33.711 --> 01:44:35.120
<v Speaker 1>these accusations to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2388
01:44:35.130 --> 01:44:37.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the accusations of that stuff is so</v>

2389
01:44:37.851 --> 01:44:40.460
<v Speaker 1>huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you're found innocent,</v>

2390
01:44:41.370 --> 01:44:45.110
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't compare to the charge.</v>

2391
01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:48.990
<v Speaker 1>Was He found innocent?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like did they go to</v>

2392
01:44:49.100 --> 01:44:51.890
<v Speaker 6>court?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't know if he was a criminal.</v>

2393
01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.770
<v Speaker 6>He tried.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think he did anything criminal.</v>

2394
01:44:54.771 --> 01:44:57.260
<v Speaker 6>So there was no evidence to even.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think so.</v>

2395
01:44:57.261 --> 01:45:01.070
<v Speaker 6>I think there was a time where Mia</v>
<v Speaker 6>Farrow was saying that he had done</v>

2396
01:45:01.071 --> 01:45:02.690
<v Speaker 6>something to one of their other</v>
<v Speaker 6>daughters.</v>

2397
01:45:02.850 --> 01:45:05.420
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then what he was saying that the</v>

2398
01:45:05.450 --> 01:45:10.010
<v Speaker 6>daughter was coached by me and that me</v>
<v Speaker 6>is crazy and she's furious that he wound</v>

2399
01:45:10.011 --> 01:45:11.990
<v Speaker 6>up with Suny.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's all crazy.</v>

2400
01:45:12.150 --> 01:45:14.430
<v Speaker 1>It's all crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I'll tell you,</v>

2401
01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:19.500
<v Speaker 1>I can shove it aside and watch crimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and misdemeanors over and over and over.</v>

2402
01:45:20.060 --> 01:45:23.280
<v Speaker 1>So one of the greatest of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the one we.</v>

2403
01:45:23.281 --> 01:45:26.640
<v Speaker 1>It was the space movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm</v>

2404
01:45:28.230 --> 01:45:30.090
<v Speaker 1>a sleeper sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2405
01:45:30.091 --> 01:45:31.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was a freaky movie.</v>

2406
01:45:31.890 --> 01:45:32.723
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

2407
01:45:32.910 --> 01:45:34.860
<v Speaker 1>so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just what he's doing now and he's made</v>

2408
01:45:34.861 --> 01:45:38.160
<v Speaker 1>two movies a year for how many years</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it make to a year?</v>

2409
01:45:38.730 --> 01:45:39.541
<v Speaker 1>Does he?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like some more creative.</v>

2431
01:46:34.011 --> 01:46:38.090
<v Speaker 1>have the connection that Ronan Farrow</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously has to do it.</v>

2432
01:46:38.091 --> 01:46:42.470
<v Speaker 1>He can't watch those movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Tom Papa sitting in is a place</v>

2433
01:46:42.471 --> 01:46:44.830
<v Speaker 1>watching the movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not connected enough where it to</v>

2434
01:46:45.020 --> 01:46:48.350
<v Speaker 1>bump me out of watching the art.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All artists are freaky.</v>

2435
01:46:48.351 --> 01:46:51.330
<v Speaker 1>If he'd get down underneath it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there's a lot of people that we</v>

2436
01:46:51.331 --> 01:46:54.510
<v Speaker 1>adore who did some pretty heinous shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2437
01:46:54.511 --> 01:46:57.460
<v Speaker 1>When someone like David Carradine dies</v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing a wetsuit with a dildo or</v>

2438
01:46:57.461 --> 01:47:01.080

01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:10.590
<v Speaker 1>really freaky shit and some weird stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People are weird.</v>

2442
01:47:11.130 --> 01:47:12.630
<v Speaker 1>Don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't dig too deep.</v>

2443
01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:16.680
<v Speaker 1>It's better just to know people on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>surface or just let it go.</v>

2444
01:47:16.710 --> 01:47:17.960
<v Speaker 1>Accept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2445
01:47:18.040 --> 01:47:20.140

2446
01:47:20.190 --> 01:47:22.440
<v Speaker 1>I mean I'm almost always willing to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

2447
01:47:22.620 --> 01:47:25.560
<v Speaker 1>Almost always willing to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the woody allen one makes it go,</v>

2448
01:47:26.390 --> 01:47:28.830
<v Speaker 1>but the bill cosby one does not make me</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do that.</v>

2449
01:47:28.831 --> 01:47:31.410
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That one is just like I got to write you</v>

2450
01:47:31.411 --> 01:47:33.840

01:47:33.870 --> 01:47:35.550
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drugged and raped.</v>

01:47:35.551 --> 01:47:36.720
<v Speaker 1>50 women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2453
01:47:36.840 --> 01:47:37.830
<v Speaker 1>That one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Definitely.</v>

2454
01:47:37.860 --> 01:47:40.260
<v Speaker 1>That's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a lifetime right off.</v>

2455
01:47:40.350 --> 01:47:43.740
<v Speaker 1>If he had made crimes and misdemeanors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe Polygon.</v>

2456
01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:47.910
<v Speaker 1>Albert just to up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about Roman Polanski?</v>

2457
01:47:48.190 --> 01:47:50.190
<v Speaker 1>Deacon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you still watch fat Albert,</v>

2458
01:47:50.520 --> 01:47:51.510
<v Speaker 1>her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>her.</v>

2459
01:47:51.570 --> 01:47:53.340
<v Speaker 1>Hey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like fat Albert.</v>

2460
01:47:53.341 --> 01:47:56.430
<v Speaker 1>Difficult to fund.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I doubt it because it seems like fat</v>

2461
01:47:56.431 --> 01:47:59.820
<v Speaker 1>Albert kind of reinforced a certain</v>
<v Speaker 1>racial stereotypes that he might</v>

2462
01:47:59.821 --> 01:48:01.680
<v Speaker 1>probably disagree with as he became</v>
<v Speaker 1>older.</v>

2463
01:48:02.100 --> 01:48:04.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a little moral stuff there and</v>

2464
01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:06.390
<v Speaker 1>was everybody getting along?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2465
01:48:07.470 --> 01:48:09.750
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was always the rumor that he had</v>

2466
01:48:09.751 --> 01:48:13.620
<v Speaker 1>bought out the little rascals and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had kept it from being aired because</v>

2467
01:48:13.621 --> 01:48:17.250
<v Speaker 1>it was racist because of the buckwheat</v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff and all that racist stuff in it.</v>

2468
01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:20.250
<v Speaker 1>Was that true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that was snopes and I think they</v>

2469
01:48:20.251 --> 01:48:21.810
<v Speaker 1>found that it wasn't true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>

2470
01:48:22.020 --> 01:48:24.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That he bought the rights to it and</v>

2471
01:48:24.121 --> 01:48:25.440
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't let it be shown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2472
01:48:25.620 --> 01:48:29.130
<v Speaker 1>Find out if that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was a lot of racist stuff back</v>

2473
01:48:29.131 --> 01:48:30.000
<v Speaker 1>then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

<v Speaker 5>It's really about togetherness.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Moving ahead.</v>

2568

2574
01:52:41.821 --> 01:52:45.030
<v Speaker 5>way thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was a white supremist supremacists</v>

<v Speaker 5>movement that put those up there.</v>

01:52:50.691 --> 01:52:54.620
<v Speaker 5>culture if we don't get these removed?</v>

<v Speaker 5>talking about a rush of just news and</v>
<v Speaker 5>constant noise and chatter and tweets.</v>

2581
01:53:05.600 --> 01:53:10.600
<v Speaker 5>Sky Takes Twenty minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eloquently commonly makes the case in a</v>

2582
01:53:10.821 --> 01:53:13.610
<v Speaker 5>way that my paraphrasing doesn't do it.</v>

<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2586
01:53:18.150 --> 01:53:21.030
<v Speaker 4>I think the problem with the confederate</v>
<v Speaker 4>flag and even some of the figures in the</v>

2587
01:53:21.031 --> 01:53:25.410
<v Speaker 4>civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get connected in a lot of people's</v>

2588
01:53:25.411 --> 01:53:28.860
<v Speaker 4>mind to southern pride in where they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>from.</v>

2589
01:53:28.861 --> 01:53:32.310
<v Speaker 4>Like southern southern pride,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Leonard Skinner heard,</v>

2590
01:53:32.400 --> 01:53:33.330
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that kind of shit.</v>

2591
01:53:33.420 --> 01:53:37.020
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I always had that fucking confederate</v>

2592
01:53:37.021 --> 01:53:39.540
<v Speaker 4>flag and their shirts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know Mina was.</v>

2593
01:53:39.780 --> 01:53:44.040
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't just a racist symbol of white</v>
<v Speaker 4>supremacy,</v>

2594
01:53:44.100 --> 01:53:46.890
<v Speaker 4>but it is a racist symbol of white</v>
<v Speaker 4>supremacy.</v>

2595
01:53:46.891 --> 01:53:47.680
<v Speaker 4>It's both.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2596
01:53:47.680 --> 01:53:48.980
<v Speaker 4>You,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you right.</v>

2597
01:53:48.990 --> 01:53:52.320
<v Speaker 4>And you got to kind of give that up and</v>
<v Speaker 4>have pride.</v>

2598
01:53:52.350 --> 01:53:55.200
<v Speaker 4>You could still pride in the south.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can still be a kick ass southerner</v>

2599
01:53:55.210 --> 01:53:58.110
<v Speaker 4>who loves the south for all the good</v>
<v Speaker 4>reasons.</v>

2600
01:53:58.350 --> 01:53:59.220
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they need to do.</v>

2601
01:53:59.250 --> 01:54:01.920
<v Speaker 4>They need to come up with a new flag.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like there's nothing wrong with the</v>

2602
01:54:01.921 --> 01:54:05.390
<v Speaker 4>south avenue flag as long as the south</v>
<v Speaker 4>recognize it's part of America like</v>

2603
01:54:05.730 --> 01:54:06.120
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2604
01:54:06.120 --> 01:54:08.190
<v Speaker 4>Just something that replaces the</v>
<v Speaker 4>confederate flag,</v>

2605
01:54:08.191 --> 01:54:11.520
<v Speaker 4>but includes everybody know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like something that's not connected to a</v>

2606
01:54:11.521 --> 01:54:14.680
<v Speaker 4>totally meant to try to keep slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was one comment he made to just.</v>

2607
01:54:15.150 --> 01:54:16.890
<v Speaker 4>This was a move,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a flawed movement.</v>

2608
01:54:16.920 --> 01:54:20.850
<v Speaker 4>This wasn't fighting for America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was fighting to tear apart America</v>

2609
01:54:21.330 --> 01:54:22.850
<v Speaker 4>and we need new symbols.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2610
01:54:22.851 --> 01:54:26.190
<v Speaker 4>like a perfect example is the flag of</v>
<v Speaker 4>Texas with the star.</v>

2611
01:54:26.250 --> 01:54:27.480
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bad Ass.</v>

2612
01:54:27.510 --> 01:54:28.400
<v Speaker 4>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>

2613
01:54:28.401 --> 01:54:31.290
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's like taxes might as well be its</v>

2614
01:54:31.291 --> 01:54:32.124
<v Speaker 4>own country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2615
01:54:32.190 --> 01:54:34.970
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that flag like that means something,</v>

2616
01:54:35.210 --> 01:54:35.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

2617
01:54:35.940 --> 01:54:40.440
<v Speaker 4>it's not about right supremacy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not always about Texas is a bad ass</v>

2618
01:54:40.441 --> 01:54:41.920
<v Speaker 4>place.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a bad ass flagged.</v>

2619
01:54:42.390 --> 01:54:43.290
<v Speaker 4>You have to have a mentor</v>

01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:41.000
<v Speaker 5>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you're not,</v>

2641
01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:44.040
<v Speaker 5>if you're not thinking about the social</v>
<v Speaker 5>issues of it as just a dollar</v>

2642
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:46.560
<v Speaker 4>issue and go for it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people don't want to give up ground.</v>

2643
01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:49.830
<v Speaker 4>Didn't make sense because they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>worried that crazy liberals are gonna</v>

2644
01:55:49.831 --> 01:55:51.210
<v Speaker 4>come in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>nerf everything.</v>

2645
01:55:51.330 --> 01:55:53.670
<v Speaker 4>It's not liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just being nice.</v>

2646
01:55:53.671 --> 01:55:55.350
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know in this case it is,</v>

2647
01:55:55.351 --> 01:55:58.350
<v Speaker 4>but it's one of the things that people</v>
<v Speaker 4>worry about that worry about giving up</v>

2648
01:55:58.351 --> 01:56:00.540
<v Speaker 4>ground because people were so ridiculous</v>
<v Speaker 4>today.</v>

2649
01:56:01.100 --> 01:56:03.210
<v Speaker 4>They give up a little ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They'll go fucking crazy,</v>

2650
01:56:03.540 --> 01:56:08.310
<v Speaker 4>no more taco Tuesdays,</v>
<v Speaker 4>cultural appropriation and can't serve</v>

2651
01:56:08.311 --> 01:56:09.630
<v Speaker 4>Sushi if you're.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

2652
01:56:10.410 --> 01:56:12.660
<v Speaker 4>I know people just start getting really</v>
<v Speaker 4>wacky.</v>

2653
01:56:12.661 --> 01:56:14.490
<v Speaker 4>Will come till even up ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is appealing.</v>

2654
01:56:14.491 --> 01:56:16.180
<v Speaker 4>It's running out of steam.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A little guess.</v>

2655
01:56:16.290 --> 01:56:18.150
<v Speaker 4>It feels like it's becoming more and</v>
<v Speaker 4>more preposterous.</v>

2656
01:56:18.151 --> 01:56:21.750
<v Speaker 4>Like being a social justice warrior is a</v>
<v Speaker 4>really ridiculous thing at this point.</v>

2657
01:56:21.780 --> 01:56:24.300
<v Speaker 4>They really feels like it's become so</v>
<v Speaker 4>absurd.</v>

2658
01:56:24.630 --> 01:56:26.310
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's not from that.</v>

2659
01:56:26.310 --> 01:56:28.290
<v Speaker 4>I think there's a correction that's been</v>
<v Speaker 4>made.</v>

2660
01:56:28.291 --> 01:56:31.740
<v Speaker 4>I think there are people like taking</v>
<v Speaker 4>more things into consideration about</v>

2661
01:56:31.741 --> 01:56:33.570
<v Speaker 4>other people and now we didn't really</v>
<v Speaker 4>think about,</v>

2662
01:56:33.690 --> 01:56:35.580
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for sure those families or with that</v>

2663
01:56:35.581 --> 01:56:37.890
<v Speaker 4>group or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

2664
01:56:38.010 --> 01:56:39.050
<v Speaker 4>it's been done.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2665
01:56:39.420 --> 01:56:40.530
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but that's how it always is.</v>

2666
01:56:40.531 --> 01:56:42.540
<v Speaker 4>The tide goes out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the tide goes and you can't explain it.</v>

2667
01:56:42.650 --> 01:56:43.670
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now.</v>

2668
01:56:43.680 --> 01:56:44.460
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

2669
01:56:44.460 --> 01:56:45.293
<v Speaker 4>Bill O'reilly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

2670
01:56:46.140 --> 01:56:47.160
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't remember that.</v>

2671
01:56:47.170 --> 01:56:47.600
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2672
01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:49.570
<v Speaker 4>I was one of the worst arguments he ever</v>
<v Speaker 4>had on the show.</v>

2673
01:56:49.571 --> 01:56:53.340
<v Speaker 4>It was talking about how he's putting</v>
<v Speaker 4>his chips on Jesus because you can't</v>

2674
01:56:53.341 --> 01:56:55.140
<v Speaker 4>explain why the tie goes in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The tide goes out.</v>

2675
01:56:55.141 --> 01:56:57.600
<v Speaker 4>He was talking to some guy who was an</v>
<v Speaker 4>atheist who is a docket.</v>

2676
01:56:57.601 --> 01:56:58.810
<v Speaker 4>Two doctrines.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2677
01:56:59.090 --> 01:57:03.810
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't dockets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>David Silverman was so dumb and dumb</v>

2678
01:57:03.811 --> 01:57:04.790
<v Speaker 4>argument and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2679
01:57:05.310 --> 01:57:06.870
<v Speaker 4>you can't explain it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you can't explain it.</v>

2680
01:57:06.900 --> 01:57:08.810
<v Speaker 4>Of course you hear you hear it.</v>

2681
01:57:08.900 --> 01:57:10.810
<v Speaker 7>So stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's a scam.</v>

2682
01:57:10.890 --> 01:57:11.810
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't know.</v>

2683
01:57:12.080 --> 01:57:14.720
<v Speaker 7>I'll tell you why.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'll tell you why.</v>

2684
01:57:14.721 --> 01:57:16.970
<v Speaker 7>It's not a scam in my opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>

2685
01:57:17.150 --> 01:57:18.460
<v Speaker 7>Tide goes in,</v>
<v Speaker 7>tide goes out,</v>

2686
01:57:18.470 --> 01:57:21.410
<v Speaker 7>never miscommunication.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You can't explain that.</v>

2687
01:57:21.590 --> 01:57:24.560
<v Speaker 7>You can explain why the tide goes in,</v>
<v Speaker 7>goes in,</v>

2688
01:57:24.561 --> 01:57:25.640
<v Speaker 7>tide,</v>
<v Speaker 7>goes to the water,</v>

2689
01:57:25.641 --> 01:57:28.640
<v Speaker 7>the tide comes in and it goes out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Mr Silverman.</v>

2690
01:57:28.950 --> 01:57:31.900
<v Speaker 7>He always comes in on top of Mount</v>
<v Speaker 7>Olympus who's making the time.</v>

2691
01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:36.940
<v Speaker 4>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The look in his eyes like.</v>

2692
01:57:36.941 --> 01:57:38.340
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can explain that though.</v>

2693
01:57:38.380 --> 01:57:43.380
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck you talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That there's gravity causes the weight.</v>

2694
01:57:44.110 --> 01:57:45.840
<v Speaker 4>Come on man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's terrible.</v>

2695
01:57:45.860 --> 01:57:47.710
<v Speaker 4>You can time the tide.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You fuck.</v>

2696
01:57:48.340 --> 01:57:51.490
<v Speaker 4>I know exactly when it's coming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's such a bummer being smart</v>

2697
01:57:51.491 --> 01:57:52.520
<v Speaker 4>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a bummer.</v>

2698
01:57:52.521 --> 01:57:54.250
<v Speaker 4>It takes away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's not dumb.</v>

2699
01:57:54.251 --> 01:57:56.350
<v Speaker 4>I think he's deceptive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like bill route.</v>

2700
01:57:56.351 --> 01:57:59.170
<v Speaker 4>It's just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing that he got kicked out of</v>

2701
01:57:59.171 --> 01:58:00.340
<v Speaker 4>Fox.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's amazing.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Maybe he's like one of the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The orgies.</v>

2704
01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:09.280

<v Speaker 4>I feel rallies beaten off on the phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I read some article about it.</v>

2707
01:58:16.541 --> 01:58:18.990
<v Speaker 4>He'd call women up and it'd be beaten</v>
<v Speaker 4>off and he's talking to them like,</v>

2708
01:58:19.030 --> 01:58:20.530

<v Speaker 4>I want to be the Loofa on your body.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

2714
01:58:33.610 --> 01:58:37.750
<v Speaker 4>I know that that whole place was running</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it was like the cosby thing.</v>

2715
01:58:37.751 --> 01:58:40.840
<v Speaker 4>It's like once the one came out it was</v>
<v Speaker 4>just rapid fire.</v>

2716
01:58:40.900 --> 01:58:41.733
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

2717
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:44.830
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you have a guy who's got that kind</v>

2718
01:58:44.831 --> 01:58:47.590
<v Speaker 5>of power and is that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2722
01:58:55.601 --> 01:59:00.601
<v Speaker 5>It's like it manifests itself in this</v>
<v Speaker 5>guy in this way and it's abusing these</v>

2723
01:59:01.331 --> 01:59:03.370
<v Speaker 5>women,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those fucking shows too.</v>

2724
01:59:03.850 --> 01:59:06.550
<v Speaker 5>Like all these shows,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like when we really think back,</v>

2725
01:59:07.030 --> 01:59:11.530
<v Speaker 5>like we look back at 2017 from the</v>
<v Speaker 5>future and we look at the state of the</v>

2726
01:59:11.531 --> 01:59:16.531
<v Speaker 5>media today and how like one side,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's Fox News or whether it's</v>

2727
01:59:17.381 --> 01:59:21.010
<v Speaker 5>CNN,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we so heavily leaned in one direction or</v>

2728
01:59:21.011 --> 01:59:23.530
<v Speaker 5>the other.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So obviously editorializing what's going</v>

2729
01:59:23.531 --> 01:59:25.060
<v Speaker 5>on the news and their opinions of the</v>
<v Speaker 5>news.</v>

2730
01:59:25.270 --> 01:59:27.100
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's all just entertainment at this</v>

2731
01:59:27.101 --> 01:59:28.090
<v Speaker 5>point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So gross.</v>

2732
01:59:28.091 --> 01:59:29.680
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know when that horrible thing</v>

2733
01:59:29.681 --> 01:59:33.190
<v Speaker 5>happened in Manchester at the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at the concert,</v>

2734
01:59:33.820 --> 01:59:34.391
<v Speaker 5>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2735
01:59:34.391 --> 01:59:37.750
<v Speaker 5>that act is heinous and what happened</v>
<v Speaker 5>that night to those people is heinous,</v>

2736
01:59:38.170 --> 01:59:43.150
<v Speaker 5>but then who does the all of the other</v>
<v Speaker 5>work of scaring the daylights out of the</v>

2737
01:59:43.151 --> 01:59:44.110
<v Speaker 5>rest of the world.</v>

2738
01:59:44.500 --> 01:59:49.500
<v Speaker 5>CNN running it nonstop for 48 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this grainy footage of young girls</v>

2739
01:59:50.971 --> 01:59:54.850
<v Speaker 5>screaming and crying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so much more powerful than what that</v>

2740
01:59:55.240 --> 01:59:58.390
<v Speaker 5>schmuck did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Blowing up those people in that place</v>

2741
01:59:58.840 --> 02:00:03.840
<v Speaker 5>there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're just as negative of force for</v>

2742
02:00:04.481 --> 02:00:06.670
<v Speaker 5>the public.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then the terrorists,</v>

2743
02:00:06.820 --> 02:00:08.950
<v Speaker 5>but they don't care.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're just trying to get attention.</v>

2744
02:00:08.980 --> 02:00:10.330
<v Speaker 5>They just want you to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It bleeds.</v>

2745
02:00:10.331 --> 02:00:12.340
<v Speaker 5>It leads.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's a big story.</v>

2746
02:00:12.400 --> 02:00:15.220
<v Speaker 5>Horrible know that people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but what is their responsibility and</v>

2747
02:00:15.221 --> 02:00:17.890
<v Speaker 5>their responsibility to report on the</v>
<v Speaker 5>news because that's a new story.</v>

2748
02:00:17.891 --> 02:00:19.480
<v Speaker 5>That's a giant,</v>
<v Speaker 5>crazy,</v>

2749
02:00:19.481 --> 02:00:23.320
<v Speaker 5>tragic event.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It would be remiss if they didn't report</v>

2750
02:00:23.321 --> 02:00:23.710
<v Speaker 5>on it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>

2751
02:00:23.710 --> 02:00:27.130
<v Speaker 5>You can report on it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you don't have to have me walking</v>

2752
02:00:27.131 --> 02:00:30.580
<v Speaker 5>with my daughter through an airport and</v>
<v Speaker 5>having it blaring out of every</v>

2753
02:00:30.581 --> 02:00:32.950
<v Speaker 5>television set.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The girls screaming.</v>

2754
02:00:33.070 --> 02:00:36.130
<v Speaker 5>You could have grown up sitting there</v>
<v Speaker 5>and analyzing it without</v>

2755
02:00:36.640 --> 02:00:39.010
<v Speaker 5>sensationalizing it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it's entertainment.</v>

2756
02:00:39.190 --> 02:00:42.430
<v Speaker 5>It's this big balls out entertainment</v>
<v Speaker 5>network.</v>

2757
02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:45.820
<v Speaker 5>It's heinous.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that's a real good argument.</v>

2758
02:00:45.821 --> 02:00:47.980
<v Speaker 5>The when people Washington voluntarily,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like at the.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I was trying.</v>

2761
02:00:52.421 --> 02:00:55.330
<v Speaker 5>I was working on this book.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was at the end of this book.</v>

2762
02:00:55.340 --> 02:00:57.430
<v Speaker 5>Had a deadline.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm just head down,</v>

2763
02:00:57.940 --> 02:01:01.930

<v Speaker 5>but I was traveling at the same time.</v>

2764
02:01:02.230 --> 02:01:06.580
<v Speaker 5>Wolf Blitzer is popping out in bars,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in restaurants at the gate.</v>

<v Speaker 5>Now knowing that you can't escape it.</v>

2767
02:01:14.440 --> 02:01:17.770
<v Speaker 5>So much pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's no responsibility about these.</v>

2768
02:01:17.860 --> 02:01:19.900
<v Speaker 5>Like you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>being an old man,</v>

<v Speaker 5>walking through the hall.</v>

2773
02:01:36.240 --> 02:01:40.010
<v Speaker 5>It's like those espn ads on espn would.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They'd be</v>

2774
02:01:40.010 --> 02:01:43.220
<v Speaker 1>walking through the net who?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The officers of espn making jokes with a</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's like they're walking through and</v>

2777
02:01:52.581 --> 02:01:53.361
<v Speaker 1>they're like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And it's a comedy bit.</v>

2780
02:01:57.740 --> 02:02:00.020
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are the people that are supposed</v>

2781
02:02:00.021 --> 02:02:03.290
<v Speaker 1>to be delivering the hard news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell me rationalize and make sense of</v>

2782

<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

<v Speaker 1>And a punchline?</v>

2785
02:02:09.750 --> 02:02:11.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what really disturbs me when</v>

2786
02:02:11.181 --> 02:02:14.840
<v Speaker 1>they do that podcast thing or Anderson</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cooper does that threesixty where he</v>

2787
02:02:14.841 --> 02:02:18.520
<v Speaker 1>sitting in the desk and allow for people</v>
<v Speaker 1>to is right for people to his left one</v>

2788
02:02:18.530 --> 02:02:20.120
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's nine people.</v>

2789
02:02:20.121 --> 02:02:23.690
<v Speaker 1>The last time I saw nine people yelling</v>
<v Speaker 1>at each other people and everyone's</v>

2790
02:02:23.691 --> 02:02:25.050
<v Speaker 1>talking over each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

2791
02:02:25.130 --> 02:02:28.880
<v Speaker 1>And some people never get a word in edge</v>
<v Speaker 1>wise and people are just jumping in and</v>

2792
02:02:28.881 --> 02:02:30.860
<v Speaker 1>it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the worst.</v>

2793
02:02:31.130 --> 02:02:32.570
<v Speaker 1>It's all entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2794
02:02:32.571 --> 02:02:34.910
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's also Edra editorialize too.</v>

2795
02:02:35.180 --> 02:02:40.180
<v Speaker 1>It's like how can a person just relayed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to you the information as unbiased as</v>

2796
02:02:40.311 --> 02:02:41.720
<v Speaker 1>they possibly can?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

2797
02:02:41.780 --> 02:02:46.780
<v Speaker 1>Is that possible today because pbs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pbs is as close as I can find it.</v>

2798
02:02:48.051 --> 02:02:50.090
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of just factual.</v>

2799
02:02:50.150 --> 02:02:53.570
<v Speaker 1>They just put it out whenever they have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have shields and Brooks on.</v>

2800
02:02:53.960 --> 02:02:55.490
<v Speaker 1>It's a snap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brooks and Dunn.</v>

2801
02:02:55.580 --> 02:02:59.270
<v Speaker 1>It's now Cheryl's in your now it's a and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just.</v>

2802
02:02:59.271 --> 02:03:03.740
<v Speaker 1>Two guys who would never be on any other</v>
<v Speaker 1>network is they're funny looking and</v>

2803
02:03:03.741 --> 02:03:08.210
<v Speaker 1>they have the conservative view in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal view and but it's very matter of</v>

2804
02:03:08.211 --> 02:03:11.930
<v Speaker 1>fact and factual and not sensational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not shitty to each other.</v>

2805
02:03:12.610 --> 02:03:15.860
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's is evenly balanced.</v>

2806
02:03:15.861 --> 02:03:18.680
<v Speaker 1>Calm as I can find.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His PBS news hour,</v>

2807
02:03:18.920 --> 02:03:23.920
<v Speaker 1>who is Sean Hannity arguing with when he</v>
<v Speaker 1>was telling Sean Hannity that he's bad</v>

2808
02:03:24.411 --> 02:03:27.760
<v Speaker 1>for America was a Ted Koppel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ted Koppel's.</v>

2809
02:03:27.770 --> 02:03:32.770
<v Speaker 1>Ted Koppel told me it was bad for</v>
<v Speaker 1>American and saying something along the</v>

2810
02:03:33.651 --> 02:03:35.480
<v Speaker 1>lines of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you think America smart enough to</v>

2811
02:03:35.481 --> 02:03:37.430
<v Speaker 1>make up their own mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is just so ridiculous.</v>

2812
02:03:37.450 --> 02:03:39.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so candy ass of him is that he backs out</v>

2813
02:03:39.621 --> 02:03:40.760
<v Speaker 1>of it and says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2814
02:03:40.761 --> 02:03:43.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a journalist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a talk show host,</v>

2815
02:03:43.460 --> 02:03:44.293
<v Speaker 1>mirror those.</v>

2816
02:03:45.550 --> 02:03:48.230
<v Speaker 8>You think we're bad for America.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You think I'm bad for America?</v>

2817
02:03:48.231 --> 02:03:49.190
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you do.</v>

2818
02:03:49.310 --> 02:03:53.750
<v Speaker 8>In the in the long haul,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think on all these opinions,</v>

2819
02:03:54.060 --> 02:03:54.950
<v Speaker 8>ted.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No.</v>

2820
02:03:54.970 --> 02:03:58.550
<v Speaker 8>You know what's sad?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Because you're very good at what you do</v>

2821
02:03:58.551 --> 02:04:01.910
<v Speaker 8>and because you have,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you have attractive,</v>

2822
02:04:03.170 --> 02:04:06.560
<v Speaker 8>a significantly more generic.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Let me finish.</v>

2823
02:04:07.190 --> 02:04:11.120
<v Speaker 8>Let me finish the set</v>
<v Speaker 8>with all you.</v>

2824
02:04:11.650 --> 02:04:13.880
<v Speaker 8>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You have attracted</v>

2825
02:04:15.830 --> 02:04:20.830
<v Speaker 8>people who are determined that ideology</v>
<v Speaker 8>is more important than facts.</v>

2826
02:04:22.710 --> 02:04:25.720
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what you need.</v>

2827
02:04:25.721 --> 02:04:28.450
<v Speaker 1>Those old dudes should be really tells</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe Riley,</v>

2828
02:04:28.451 --> 02:04:31.730
<v Speaker 1>he ruined journalism to Ted Koppel's on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a goddamn rampage.</v>

2829
02:04:32.340 --> 02:04:33.760
<v Speaker 1>The loofa sponge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bitch.</v>

2830
02:04:33.790 --> 02:04:37.860
<v Speaker 1>I got something to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've interviewed him a number of times.</v>

2831
02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:40.590
<v Speaker 7>Not An easy interview.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How would you do it?</v>

2832
02:04:41.680 --> 02:04:43.760
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>some and I have talked about this</v>

2833
02:04:43.761 --> 02:04:48.380
<v Speaker 8>general subject and many times over the</v>
<v Speaker 8>years it's irrelevant how I would do it.</v>

2834
02:04:48.860 --> 02:04:49.880
<v Speaker 8>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2835
02:04:49.881 --> 02:04:51.890
<v Speaker 8>who made it irrelevant.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You do.</v>

2836
02:04:52.940 --> 02:04:56.810
<v Speaker 8>You have changed the television</v>
<v Speaker 8>landscape over the past 20 years.</v>

2837
02:04:56.811 --> 02:05:01.040
<v Speaker 8>You took it from being objective and</v>
<v Speaker 8>being subjective and entertaining.</v>

2838
02:05:01.520 --> 02:05:04.610
<v Speaker 8>And in this current climate,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it doesn't matter what the interviewer</v>

2839
02:05:04.611 --> 02:05:07.550
<v Speaker 8>asks him,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Mr Trump was going to say whatever he</v>

2840
02:05:07.551 --> 02:05:10.880
<v Speaker 8>wants to say it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>as outrageous as it may be.</v>

2841
02:05:11.200 --> 02:05:12.340
<v Speaker 7>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But you know,</v>

2842
02:05:12.341 --> 02:05:15.670
<v Speaker 7>your old network,</v>
<v Speaker 7>ABC does interview Mr Trump on a regular</v>

2843
02:05:15.671 --> 02:05:18.310
<v Speaker 7>basis and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>our job,</v>

2844
02:05:18.311 --> 02:05:22.780
<v Speaker 7>whether I'm a commentator or a reporter,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is to get as much information,</v>

2845
02:05:22.781 --> 02:05:26.470
<v Speaker 7>number one,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and to show the viewer who the person</v>

2846
02:05:26.471 --> 02:05:27.430
<v Speaker 7>really is.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So again,</v>

2847
02:05:27.431 --> 02:05:31.350
<v Speaker 7>I'll go back to he sitting on nightline,</v>
<v Speaker 7>your opposed,</v>

2848
02:05:31.570 --> 02:05:34.240
<v Speaker 7>right opposite him.</v>
<v Speaker 7>How do you do it?</v>

2849
02:05:35.100 --> 02:05:37.380
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the first way you do it is nothing in</v>

2850
02:05:37.381 --> 02:05:39.720
<v Speaker 8>the end if you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but some reporting,</v>

2851
02:05:39.970 --> 02:05:44.310
<v Speaker 8>it's an old fashioned concept.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Another think demonstrating who and what</v>

2852
02:05:44.311 --> 02:05:49.311
<v Speaker 8>Mr Trump is and what his various</v>
<v Speaker 8>policies really amount to a something</v>

2853
02:05:49.471 --> 02:05:52.230
<v Speaker 8>you don't do in an interview.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He doesn't answer the questions</v>

2854
02:05:52.400 --> 02:05:54.620
<v Speaker 7>pointed out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's a whole different ballgame on</v>

2855
02:05:54.621 --> 02:05:57.290
<v Speaker 7>cable.</v>
<v Speaker 7>TV commentators like me have just ruined</v>

2856
02:05:57.291 --> 02:05:59.930
<v Speaker 7>the country I copped to that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's true,</v>

2857
02:06:00.480 --> 02:06:01.670
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>I've ruined everything.</v>

2858
02:06:03.540 --> 02:06:04.740
<v Speaker 6>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's entertainment.</v>

2859
02:06:04.770 --> 02:06:06.880
<v Speaker 6>Like just give us the news,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but there's,</v>

2860
02:06:06.930 --> 02:06:08.490
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's so much money in it.</v>

2861
02:06:08.491 --> 02:06:10.050
<v Speaker 6>And it's sort of been,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why did they have to.</v>

2862
02:06:10.410 --> 02:06:12.780
<v Speaker 6>Here's the question,</v>
<v Speaker 6>why can't they just put on an</v>

2863
02:06:12.781 --> 02:06:17.010
<v Speaker 6>entertaining show that makes money?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like whose responsibility is it to relay</v>

2864
02:06:17.011 --> 02:06:19.710
<v Speaker 6>the news to the people?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Is it Fox News responsibility?</v>

2865
02:06:20.040 --> 02:06:23.670
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 6>don't they have some sort of an out that</v>

2866
02:06:23.671 --> 02:06:25.620
<v Speaker 6>they're an entertainment program?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2867
02:06:25.621 --> 02:06:27.060
<v Speaker 6>but they're not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What are they?</v>

2868
02:06:27.120 --> 02:06:29.090
<v Speaker 6>What are they?</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is it?</v>

2869
02:06:30.360 --> 02:06:32.640
<v Speaker 6>Let's say you decide,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I understand,</v>

2870
02:06:32.910 --> 02:06:37.740
<v Speaker 6>but let's say you decided to call the a</v>
<v Speaker 6>show the Tom Papa News and you start</v>

2871
02:06:37.860 --> 02:06:42.860
<v Speaker 6>talking about the news,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like do you have a very specific need to</v>

2872
02:06:42.991 --> 02:06:46.110
<v Speaker 6>like if we know you as an entertainer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And Bill O'reilly was always an</v>

2873
02:06:46.111 --> 02:06:48.750
<v Speaker 6>entertainer.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He was a entertainment news reporter on</v>

2874
02:06:48.751 --> 02:06:51.420
<v Speaker 6>hard copy before he was ever on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>on this.</v>

2875
02:06:51.810 --> 02:06:52.740
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>So we know he's.</v>

2876
02:06:52.741 --> 02:06:56.160
<v Speaker 6>That guy did.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Would you have a responsible who has a</v>

2877
02:06:56.161 --> 02:06:59.460
<v Speaker 6>responsibility to tell the news in an</v>
<v Speaker 6>objective sense?</v>

2878
02:06:59.461 --> 02:07:03.120
<v Speaker 6>Like if you can editorialize,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you can write things out and you can</v>

2879
02:07:03.121 --> 02:07:05.490
<v Speaker 6>decide which stories should get the most</v>
<v Speaker 6>coverage.</v>

2880
02:07:05.640 --> 02:07:08.790
<v Speaker 6>During the campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 6>CNN was all about the sexual harassment</v>

2881
02:07:08.791 --> 02:07:12.120
<v Speaker 6>cases against trump.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then Fox News was all about hillary</v>

2882
02:07:12.121 --> 02:07:13.640
<v Speaker 6>and her email scandal.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean they were,</v>

2883
02:07:13.740 --> 02:07:15.800
<v Speaker 6>they just decided once I was going to</v>
<v Speaker 6>go,</v>

2884
02:07:15.870 --> 02:07:18.780
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>who's to say what you can and can't do</v>

2885
02:07:18.781 --> 02:07:21.450
<v Speaker 6>when it comes to that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We don't really have like a hard fast</v>

2886
02:07:21.451 --> 02:07:23.850
<v Speaker 6>rule when it comes to television</v>
<v Speaker 6>journalism.</v>

2887
02:07:24.170 --> 02:07:27.300
<v Speaker 6>I mean we think New York times we think,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2888
02:07:27.580 --> 02:07:30.930
<v Speaker 6>in certain news papers that have a</v>
<v Speaker 6>great,</v>

2889
02:07:31.300 --> 02:07:32.550
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we have respect for them.</v>

2890
02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:36.100
<v Speaker 6>They have a certain amount of fact</v>
<v Speaker 6>checking and</v>

2891
02:07:36.100 --> 02:07:38.950
<v Speaker 4>reliability,</v>
<v Speaker 4>responsibility rather you can reliably</v>

2892
02:07:39.220 --> 02:07:40.630
<v Speaker 4>assess that this is going to be the</v>
<v Speaker 4>news,</v>

2893
02:07:40.660 --> 02:07:42.310
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>To a certain extent.</v>

2894
02:07:42.460 --> 02:07:44.110
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's,</v>

2895
02:07:44.111 --> 02:07:44.944
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

2896
02:07:44.980 --> 02:07:49.980
<v Speaker 5>once you start a 24 hour news station,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's a beast.</v>

2897
02:07:51.670 --> 02:07:53.680
<v Speaker 5>It's got to be fed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And how do you keep those people</v>

2898
02:07:53.681 --> 02:07:54.150
<v Speaker 5>attracted</v>

2899
02:07:54.150 --> 02:07:56.220
<v Speaker 4>but isn't even really a 24 hour news</v>
<v Speaker 4>station.</v>

2900
02:07:56.221 --> 02:07:59.430
<v Speaker 4>When you think about what CNN is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have w Kamau bell show,</v>

2901
02:07:59.500 --> 02:08:01.590
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They have Anthony Bourdain's show.</v>

2902
02:08:01.650 --> 02:08:04.240
<v Speaker 4>They used to have that Tim ferriss show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've got a bunch of shows that have</v>

2903
02:08:04.630 --> 02:08:07.530
<v Speaker 4>Morgan spurlock show nothing to do with</v>
<v Speaker 4>news.</v>

2904
02:08:07.531 --> 02:08:09.000
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2905
02:08:09.060 --> 02:08:09.930
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>other than,</v>

2906
02:08:10.370 --> 02:08:12.180
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you haven't seen the show before,</v>

2907
02:08:12.660 --> 02:08:15.000
<v Speaker 4>this is new,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they might be talking about some</v>

2908
02:08:15.001 --> 02:08:16.650
<v Speaker 4>information you might not have heard</v>
<v Speaker 4>before,</v>

2909
02:08:16.651 --> 02:08:19.200
<v Speaker 4>but it's not like breaking news show</v>

2910
02:08:19.300 --> 02:08:21.100
<v Speaker 5>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that,</v>

2911
02:08:21.610 --> 02:08:23.260
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what does CNN stands for?</v>

2912
02:08:23.590 --> 02:08:26.320
<v Speaker 5>Cable News Network and Fox News.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think once,</v>

2913
02:08:26.321 --> 02:08:29.140
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>once you know that people are looking to</v>

2914
02:08:29.170 --> 02:08:32.830
<v Speaker 5>you as the news,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there should be some responsibility.</v>

2915
02:08:32.831 --> 02:08:35.620
<v Speaker 5>I think that there's somebody,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some grownup has to be,</v>

2916
02:08:36.580 --> 02:08:37.750
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in control of that.</v>

2917
02:08:37.751 --> 02:08:39.250
<v Speaker 5>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these are stocks,</v>

2918
02:08:39.400 --> 02:08:40.120
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these are,</v>

2919
02:08:40.120 --> 02:08:45.120
<v Speaker 5>these are parts of giant corporations</v>
<v Speaker 5>with stock prices and the people running</v>

2920
02:08:45.461 --> 02:08:49.480
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to meetings and get raked over</v>

2921
02:08:49.481 --> 02:08:52.900
<v Speaker 5>the coals when their ratings are down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And what are you going to do about it?</v>

2922
02:08:53.140 --> 02:08:53.973
<v Speaker 5>Jeff Zucker.</v>

2923
02:08:54.020 --> 02:08:59.020
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's going to be like when wwe f</v>
<v Speaker 4>had to change her name to ww II.</v>

2924
02:09:00.170 --> 02:09:03.060
<v Speaker 4>So there'll be c and e.</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

2925
02:09:04.520 --> 02:09:05.061
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>

2926
02:09:05.061 --> 02:09:07.250
<v Speaker 5>look,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you put an old man news station on</v>

2927
02:09:07.550 --> 02:09:09.230
<v Speaker 5>right,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we'd be like,</v>

2928
02:09:09.231 --> 02:09:12.710
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>finally this is like all measured in all</v>

2929
02:09:12.711 --> 02:09:17.711
<v Speaker 5>sides and this is America first before</v>
<v Speaker 5>party it probably deep dog shit ratings.</v>

2930
02:09:18.680 --> 02:09:20.870
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because it doesn't have all the other</v>

2931
02:09:20.871 --> 02:09:23.240
<v Speaker 5>people going crazy on it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2932
02:09:23.300 --> 02:09:24.920
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just,</v>

2933
02:09:25.370 --> 02:09:29.270
<v Speaker 5>you just hope that a little kind of</v>
<v Speaker 5>muddle through it and end up.</v>

2934
02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:31.460
<v Speaker 5>It just won't grownups in charge.</v>

2935
02:09:33.300 --> 02:09:34.800
<v Speaker 4>What's the dude?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The CNN,</v>

2936
02:09:34.830 --> 02:09:36.660
<v Speaker 4>the dude,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Gq guy that's in his basement.</v>

2937
02:09:36.661 --> 02:09:39.210
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the resistance.</v>

2938
02:09:39.211 --> 02:09:43.770
<v Speaker 4>Keith Olbermann</v>
<v Speaker 4>is kind of put that dude on TV.</v>

2939
02:09:44.850 --> 02:09:47.670
<v Speaker 4>Comedy Central.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just let him write his own shit.</v>

2940
02:09:48.180 --> 02:09:51.900
<v Speaker 4>I saw like a clip of him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it really looks like it's on a</v>

2941
02:09:51.901 --> 02:09:55.020
<v Speaker 4>cable news network somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't have a makeup person anymore.</v>

2942
02:09:55.910 --> 02:10:00.910
<v Speaker 4>I just had to make desks and these</v>
<v Speaker 4>incredibly verbose speeches and</v>

2943
02:10:01.250 --> 02:10:04.370
<v Speaker 4>assaulting trump over and over again</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying so cool.</v>

2944
02:10:04.570 --> 02:10:07.440
<v Speaker 4>When they were sold out to the Russians</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this was an invasion,</v>

2945
02:10:07.441 --> 02:10:09.300
<v Speaker 4>make no mistake about it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We are the resistance.</v>

2946
02:10:09.950 --> 02:10:11.790
<v Speaker 4>Super intense.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2947
02:10:11.791 --> 02:10:14.010
<v Speaker 4>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's got that weird cable access.</v>

2948
02:10:14.011 --> 02:10:15.240
<v Speaker 4>Feel to it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It really does.</v>

2949
02:10:15.520 --> 02:10:17.060
<v Speaker 4>He's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He used to be like,</v>

2950
02:10:17.070 --> 02:10:19.830
<v Speaker 4>with all these people around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now he's down to printing his own pages,</v>

2951
02:10:20.860 --> 02:10:22.740
<v Speaker 4>coal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>landing his own scripts.</v>

2952
02:10:25.070 --> 02:10:27.600
<v Speaker 4>Somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Somebody tweeted about it the other day</v>

2953
02:10:28.080 --> 02:10:30.240
<v Speaker 4>about what a fucking nut here is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>

2954
02:10:30.241 --> 02:10:33.030
<v Speaker 4>I didn't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I hadn't been paying attention.</v>

2955
02:10:33.410 --> 02:10:35.030
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to find.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2956
02:10:35.031 --> 02:10:35.970
<v Speaker 4>he's not.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2958
02:10:38.750 --> 02:10:40.520
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just coming in.</v>

2959
02:10:40.720 --> 02:10:43.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2960
02:10:43.520 --> 02:10:44.840
<v Speaker 4>What did they say?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it a snake bite?</v>

2961
02:10:44.970 --> 02:10:48.590
<v Speaker 4>A Bella can come home between 4:30 and</v>
<v Speaker 4>six.</v>

2962
02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:49.513
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2963
02:10:50.450 --> 02:10:53.210
<v Speaker 4>So she knows that we're on the air so</v>
<v Speaker 4>she doesn't want to disturb,</v>

2964
02:10:53.211 --> 02:10:55.190
<v Speaker 4>but I want to find out what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2965
02:10:55.640 --> 02:10:58.010
<v Speaker 4>I hope it wasn't a snake bite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Snake Venom.</v>

2966
02:10:58.011 --> 02:10:59.780
<v Speaker 4>As expensive as the snake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Antidote.</v>

2967
02:11:00.050 --> 02:11:02.150
<v Speaker 4>Very expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you're on the trail,</v>

2968
02:11:02.151 --> 02:11:05.030
<v Speaker 4>like I was in the and the and the snake</v>
<v Speaker 4>bit,</v>

2971
02:11:08.510 --> 02:11:10.100
<v Speaker 4>It's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That could happen to us.</v>

2972
02:11:10.190 --> 02:11:14.120
<v Speaker 4>That's one of the things we really</v>
<v Speaker 4>should know to went over a snake once I</v>

2973
02:11:14.121 --> 02:11:16.940
<v Speaker 4>was running with my dog,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a snake.</v>

2974
02:11:17.060 --> 02:11:19.060
<v Speaker 4>Now this one I didn't run over like hit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2975
02:11:19.100 --> 02:11:24.100
<v Speaker 4>This one I just saw in the road I was</v>
<v Speaker 4>running and I jumped over this stick and</v>

2976
02:11:24.561 --> 02:11:27.270
<v Speaker 4>as I was jumping over the stick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I realized there was a rattle snake,</v>

2977
02:11:28.070 --> 02:11:31.460
<v Speaker 4>really big one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stretched out who flattened out on the</v>

2978
02:11:31.461 --> 02:11:33.880
<v Speaker 4>road on the trail.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Completely flattened out,</v>

2979
02:11:34.040 --> 02:11:35.150
<v Speaker 4>and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2980
02:11:35.300 --> 02:11:36.950
<v Speaker 4>the length of my arms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2981
02:11:37.040 --> 02:11:38.590
<v Speaker 4>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a big ass fucking snakes.</v>

2982
02:11:38.591 --> 02:11:42.380
<v Speaker 4>Snakes thick like my wrist around.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was a fucking thick old snake.</v>

2983
02:11:42.620 --> 02:11:44.420
<v Speaker 4>So that's a lot of venom that would come</v>
<v Speaker 4>out of that head.</v>

2984
02:11:44.510 --> 02:11:47.480
<v Speaker 4>I guess I've heard of.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know if it's a myth or not,</v>

2985
02:11:47.481 --> 02:11:49.910
<v Speaker 4>but I heard that the young ones are</v>
<v Speaker 4>actually more dangerous because they</v>

2986
02:11:49.911 --> 02:11:51.140
<v Speaker 4>unload all their venom.</v>

2987
02:11:51.260 --> 02:11:53.330
<v Speaker 4>Whereas the older ones just give you a</v>
<v Speaker 4>little zap.</v>

2988
02:11:53.700 --> 02:11:55.370
<v Speaker 4>The old ones like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

2989
02:11:55.371 --> 02:11:57.540
<v Speaker 4>relax.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're smart.</v>

2990
02:11:57.710 --> 02:11:59.510
<v Speaker 4>Keep the snake bite victim,</v>
<v Speaker 4>victim,</v>

2991
02:11:59.511 --> 02:12:01.310
<v Speaker 4>calm,</v>
<v Speaker 4>keeping them still and quiet.</v>

2992
02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:06.470
<v Speaker 4>Restrict movement and keep the effected</v>
<v Speaker 4>area at or below heart level to reduce</v>

2993
02:12:06.471 --> 02:12:09.890
<v Speaker 4>the flow of venom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Remove any rings or constricting items</v>

2994
02:12:09.891 --> 02:12:12.110
<v Speaker 4>and clothing as the effected area may</v>
<v Speaker 4>swell.</v>

2995
02:12:12.111 --> 02:12:15.520
<v Speaker 4>Allow the bite to bleed freely for 15 to</v>
<v Speaker 4>30 seconds before cleansing.</v>

2996
02:12:15.950 --> 02:12:18.620
<v Speaker 4>Create a loose splint to help restrict</v>
<v Speaker 4>the movement of the area.</v>

2997
02:12:18.621 --> 02:12:20.480
<v Speaker 4>Contact medical help as soon as</v>
<v Speaker 4>possible.</v>

2998
02:12:20.481 --> 02:12:22.880
<v Speaker 4>See below.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Evacuate the victim immediately by</v>

2999
02:12:22.881 --> 02:12:26.090
<v Speaker 4>hiking to a car,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a helicopter or medical staff.</v>

3000
02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:28.070
<v Speaker 4>Monitor the person's vital signs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>temperature,</v>

3001
02:12:28.071 --> 02:12:30.920
<v Speaker 4>pulse rate of breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and blood pressure if possible.</v>

3002
02:12:31.220 --> 02:12:34.220
<v Speaker 4>But does it say you do so?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So number six,</v>

3003
02:12:34.221 --> 02:12:37.160
<v Speaker 4>evacuate the victim immediately by</v>
<v Speaker 4>hiking to a car.</v>

3004
02:12:37.910 --> 02:12:41.100
<v Speaker 4>So does that mean that the person has</v>
<v Speaker 4>been baking?</v>

3005
02:12:41.120 --> 02:12:43.520
<v Speaker 4>Hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would it do not waste time hunting for</v>

3006
02:12:43.521 --> 02:12:47.930
<v Speaker 4>the snake and did not risk another bite.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it's not easy to kill the snake while</v>

3007
02:12:47.931 --> 02:12:50.450
<v Speaker 4>they're trying to tell you to kill it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>after it has been killed,</v>

3008
02:12:50.451 --> 02:12:53.030
<v Speaker 4>a snake can still bite for up to an</v>
<v Speaker 4>hour.</v>

3009
02:12:53.031 --> 02:12:55.970
<v Speaker 4>So be careful what transporting it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Holy Shit,</v>

3010
02:12:56.840 --> 02:12:59.510
<v Speaker 4>that's scary.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that's kind.</v>

3011
02:12:59.550 --> 02:13:00.530
<v Speaker 4>They're Kinda like saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

02:13:00.531 --> 02:13:03.560
<v Speaker 4>I know you're going to kill this fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>snake if I looked it up for a hiking</v>

3013
02:13:03.580 --> 02:13:06.800
<v Speaker 4>because a job and you're in a house,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's given you other information</v>

3014

<v Speaker 4>and you're hiking alone?</v>
<v Speaker 4>A lot of words.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's inconclusive.</v>

3035
02:13:50.131 --> 02:13:52.570
<v Speaker 1>We're gonna have to run another test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

3036
02:13:53.150 --> 02:13:54.210

<v Speaker 1>we're going to be up to three grand.</v>

3038

<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're on the test and then right now</v>

02:14:04.290 --> 02:14:08.940
<v Speaker 1>There's no way to cure it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They put the cat down and then they say,</v>

<v Speaker 6>Snake questions on Reddit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

3045
02:14:21.361 --> 02:14:22.230
<v Speaker 6>No.</v>
<v Speaker 6>First Aid,</v>

3046
02:14:22.250 --> 02:14:23.970
<v Speaker 6>it is much better than performing bad</v>
<v Speaker 6>for.</v>

3047
02:14:24.000 --> 02:14:24.811
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

3048
02:14:24.811 --> 02:14:27.540
<v Speaker 6>First date is much better than</v>
<v Speaker 6>performing bad first aid.</v>

3049
02:14:27.900 --> 02:14:30.270
<v Speaker 6>Don't cut at or around the site of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>bite.</v>

3050
02:14:30.271 --> 02:14:33.150
<v Speaker 6>Don't compress the bitten limb with a</v>
<v Speaker 6>cord or a tight bandage.</v>

3051
02:14:33.151 --> 02:14:38.151
<v Speaker 6>Don't attempt to extract or neutralize</v>
<v Speaker 6>venom using electricity fire permit</v>

3052
02:14:38.431 --> 02:14:42.450
<v Speaker 6>grant program at granite and that says</v>
<v Speaker 6>permission granted,</v>

3053
02:14:42.470 --> 02:14:45.570
<v Speaker 6>hermine granted permission granted salt.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is that?</v>

3054
02:14:46.890 --> 02:14:50.730
<v Speaker 6>Like an orange blackstone's,</v>
<v Speaker 6>more mouths mud leaves,</v>

3055
02:14:50.740 --> 02:14:54.180
<v Speaker 6>etc. All snake bite kits are dangerous</v>
<v Speaker 6>and should not be used.</v>

3056
02:14:54.210 --> 02:14:57.000
<v Speaker 6>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 6>This wAs also confirmed by the snake</v>

3057
02:14:57.210 --> 02:15:01.210
<v Speaker 6>snake bite poison line.</v>
<v Speaker 6>A lot of snake bite patients injured</v>

3058
02:15:01.220 --> 02:15:05.760
<v Speaker 6>themselves by panicking directly after a</v>
<v Speaker 6>snake bite by tripping over a rock or a</v>

3059
02:15:05.761 --> 02:15:06.680
<v Speaker 6>tree trunk.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

3060
02:15:06.690 --> 02:15:08.580
<v Speaker 6>by falling off the cliff side of the</v>
<v Speaker 6>trail.</v>

3061
02:15:08.581 --> 02:15:11.310
<v Speaker 6>Staying calm is important.</v>
<v Speaker 6>After snake bite,</v>

3062
02:15:11.580 --> 02:15:14.190
<v Speaker 6>walk about 20 to 30 feet away from the</v>
<v Speaker 6>snake.</v>

3063
02:15:14.220 --> 02:15:16.980
<v Speaker 6>Find a safe,</v>
<v Speaker 6>safe place to sit down asap.</v>

3064
02:15:17.220 --> 02:15:20.100
<v Speaker 6>The venom can rapidly diffuse into your</v>
<v Speaker 6>system.</v>

3065
02:15:20.820 --> 02:15:24.510
<v Speaker 6>This can drop your blood pressure too</v>
<v Speaker 6>low to pump all the way to your head</v>

3066
02:15:24.511 --> 02:15:25.800
<v Speaker 6>while standing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whoa,</v>

3067
02:15:26.100 --> 02:15:29.670
<v Speaker 6>sitting down reduces your chances of</v>
<v Speaker 6>feigning within the first few minutes.</v>

3068
02:15:29.671 --> 02:15:32.640
<v Speaker 6>If you faint,</v>
<v Speaker 6>shouldn't be more for more than a few</v>

3069
02:15:32.640 --> 02:15:34.520
<v Speaker 6>minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>remove any race,</v>

3070
02:15:34.590 --> 02:15:35.850
<v Speaker 6>any rings,</v>
<v Speaker 6>watches,</v>

3071
02:15:35.851 --> 02:15:38.310
<v Speaker 6>or tight clothing while it's going to</v>
<v Speaker 6>swell up.</v>

3072
02:15:38.370 --> 02:15:40.140
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Anything else from the benton limb?</v>

3073
02:15:40.141 --> 02:15:41.550
<v Speaker 6>Because of swelling,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we will make a lot,</v>

3074
02:15:41.620 --> 02:15:44.580
<v Speaker 6>a lot bigger as soon.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Take five minutes to calm down and plan</v>

3075
02:15:44.581 --> 02:15:48.030
<v Speaker 6>your evacuation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The only effective treatment for a snake</v>

3076
02:15:48.060 --> 02:15:51.900
<v Speaker 6>bite,</v>
<v Speaker 6>even animation is the right antivenom to</v>

3077
02:15:51.901 --> 02:15:54.690
<v Speaker 6>neutralize it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>to not Wait for symptoms to appear.</v>

3078
02:15:54.691 --> 02:15:58.230
<v Speaker 6>If bitten is important to get in touch</v>
<v Speaker 6>the emergency personnel as soon as</v>

3079
02:15:58.231 --> 02:16:01.890
<v Speaker 6>possible to get you to a hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you have a cell phone and service,</v>

3080
02:16:02.220 --> 02:16:03.240
<v Speaker 6>great call nine,</v>
<v Speaker 6>one,</v>

3081
02:16:03.241 --> 02:16:04.410
<v Speaker 6>one,</v>
<v Speaker 6>or the park ranger.</v>

3082
02:16:04.411 --> 02:16:07.080
<v Speaker 6>If there's no service.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Think about the last time you had fallen</v>

3083
02:16:07.600 --> 02:16:08.360
<v Speaker 1>phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3084
02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:10.280
<v Speaker 1>that we didn't have a cell phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the other thing.</v>

3085
02:16:11.140 --> 02:16:11.811
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3086
02:16:11.811 --> 02:16:12.950
<v Speaker 1>we're going to disconnect.</v>

3087
02:16:13.590 --> 02:16:15.480
<v Speaker 6>Look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're supposed to circle the location,</v>

3088
02:16:15.481 --> 02:16:19.050
<v Speaker 6>the snake bite and write down the time</v>
<v Speaker 6>next to it so when they find you dead.</v>

3089
02:16:19.080 --> 02:16:19.780
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>draw.</v>

3090
02:16:19.780 --> 02:16:23.340
<v Speaker 6>Circle around the border of the swelling</v>
<v Speaker 6>and write down the time.</v>

3091
02:16:23.610 --> 02:16:26.370
<v Speaker 6>Write down all the things you're</v>
<v Speaker 6>experiencing that are not normal.</v>

3092
02:16:26.400 --> 02:16:29.790
<v Speaker 6>So now we have pens on us.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know we have markers and</v>

3093
02:16:30.560 --> 02:16:33.040
<v Speaker 4>examples are metallic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Taste in your mouth.</v>

3094
02:16:33.070 --> 02:16:36.010

<v Speaker 4>Like you're not gonna be able to get up</v>

3211
02:21:55.371 --> 02:21:56.930
<v Speaker 4>quick enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mine was coiled.</v>

3212
02:21:57.840 --> 02:21:58.520
<v Speaker 4>Mmm.</v>

<v Speaker 4>They have a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they call a strike height and they</v>

3214
02:22:00.951 --> 02:22:04.160
<v Speaker 4>can make it above some other boots.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Some people are asking about if they can</v>

3215
02:22:04.161 --> 02:22:07.400
<v Speaker 4>get kevlar jeans so that they don't go</v>
<v Speaker 4>through their genes.</v>

3216
02:22:07.650 --> 02:22:09.080
<v Speaker 4>That's a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they don't really.</v>

3274
02:24:31.570 --> 02:24:32.950
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That is a problem with some people,</v>

<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just don't know how to keep it together</v>

3276
02:24:34.991 --> 02:24:38.020
<v Speaker 6>when things aren't going the best.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're pissy.</v>

3277
02:24:38.280 --> 02:24:38.780
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3284
02:24:50.060 --> 02:24:52.990
<v Speaker 6>but you know what the problem with those</v>
<v Speaker 6>guys is as many problems,</v>

3285
02:24:53.200 --> 02:24:55.480
<v Speaker 6>but one of the big problems is they're</v>
<v Speaker 6>always in combat.</v>

3286
02:24:56.070 --> 02:24:56.940
<v Speaker 6>They're always,</v>
<v Speaker 6>always fight,</v>

3287
02:24:56.980 --> 02:25:00.160
<v Speaker 6>always forcing their opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're always pushing their opinions</v>

3288
02:25:00.161 --> 02:25:04.300
<v Speaker 6>with a lot of energy and emphasis and</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're always resisting anything that</v>

3289
02:25:04.301 --> 02:25:06.910
<v Speaker 6>is contrary to their opinions.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Never considering them.</v>

3290
02:25:07.300 --> 02:25:09.450
<v Speaker 6>Never going over it like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

3291
02:25:09.550 --> 02:25:12.750
<v Speaker 6>Really objectively.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's always this,</v>

3292
02:25:12.751 --> 02:25:14.690
<v Speaker 6>this interview,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is a natural,</v>

3293
02:25:14.930 --> 02:25:18.160
<v Speaker 6>not natural knee jerk reaction that all</v>
<v Speaker 6>oF us are subject to.</v>

3294
02:25:18.250 --> 02:25:20.650
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we're all subject to that kind of</v>

3295
02:25:21.550 --> 02:25:25.420
<v Speaker 6>unfortunate defense of our ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Our initial idea,</v>

3296
02:25:26.070 --> 02:25:28.620
<v Speaker 5>there's a book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do not know the name,</v>

3297
02:25:28.800 --> 02:25:32.580
<v Speaker 5>I'll find out and post it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that my friend read and he's a</v>

3298
02:25:32.640 --> 02:25:36.600
<v Speaker 5>conservative and it's basically about</v>
<v Speaker 5>that.</v>

3299
02:25:36.690 --> 02:25:41.690
<v Speaker 5>It's how to take here something,</v>
<v Speaker 5>recognize what your initial knee jerk</v>

3300
02:25:41.701 --> 02:25:44.490
<v Speaker 5>reaction is because of where you stand</v>
<v Speaker 5>on what you believe</v>

3301
02:25:46.380 --> 02:25:49.710
<v Speaker 5>and evaluate it and give yourself a beat</v>
<v Speaker 5>to say,</v>

3302
02:25:49.711 --> 02:25:51.210
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe I'm wrong,</v>

3303
02:25:51.630 --> 02:25:53.580
<v Speaker 5>and trying to work your way around the</v>
<v Speaker 5>argument.</v>

3304
02:25:54.030 --> 02:25:55.830
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's,</v>

3305
02:25:56.160 --> 02:26:01.160
<v Speaker 5>he really believes in this book.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like we're so all naturally set for</v>

3306
02:26:01.231 --> 02:26:03.960
<v Speaker 5>these trigger words.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like you hear hannity or you hear trump</v>

3307
02:26:03.961 --> 02:26:07.380
<v Speaker 5>where you hear hillary,</v>
<v Speaker 5>where you hear the clintons and</v>

3308
02:26:08.160 --> 02:26:11.220
<v Speaker 5>everybody has their preconceived</v>
<v Speaker 5>beliefs.</v>

3309
02:26:11.460 --> 02:26:14.490
<v Speaker 5>So you just back up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whatever's those stories are in this</v>

3310
02:26:14.491 --> 02:26:18.840
<v Speaker 5>book is about breaking that down and</v>
<v Speaker 5>trying to be more open and more logical.</v>

3311
02:26:19.720 --> 02:26:23.800
<v Speaker 6>I've definitely tried to work on that a</v>
<v Speaker 6>lot during my time that I've been doing</v>

3312
02:26:23.801 --> 02:26:25.780
<v Speaker 6>the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've gotten way better at it.</v>

3313
02:26:25.781 --> 02:26:27.350
<v Speaker 6>I'm definitely not the best at it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3314
02:26:27.430 --> 02:26:30.880
<v Speaker 6>But it's something I'm way better at now</v>
<v Speaker 6>than I was when I first started doing</v>

3315
02:26:30.881 --> 02:26:31.900
<v Speaker 6>the podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So yeah.</v>

3316
02:26:32.080 --> 02:26:34.510
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because you realize like how much iT</v>

3317
02:26:34.540 --> 02:26:39.070
<v Speaker 6>gets in the way of a good conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It gets in the way of understanding how</v>

3318
02:26:39.071 --> 02:26:42.220
<v Speaker 6>other people think and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sometimes you have to dig your heels in</v>

3319
02:26:42.221 --> 02:26:44.730
<v Speaker 6>and defend your position because you</v>
<v Speaker 6>think the other person's being illogical</v>

3320
02:26:45.160 --> 02:26:49.570
<v Speaker 6>and that's okay too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I think it's also important to look</v>

3321
02:26:49.571 --> 02:26:52.210
<v Speaker 6>at what someone else is saying and try</v>
<v Speaker 6>to make,</v>

3322
02:26:52.240 --> 02:26:54.460
<v Speaker 6>see if it makes any sense at all.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And it might not,</v>

3323
02:26:54.970 --> 02:26:57.130
<v Speaker 6>but give it a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Give it a chance to give it a chance.</v>

3324
02:26:57.131 --> 02:26:57.561
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

3325
02:26:57.561 --> 02:27:00.250
<v Speaker 6>it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I tried to look at someone from someone</v>

3326
02:27:00.251 --> 02:27:01.360
<v Speaker 6>else's point of view.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I try to go,</v>

3327
02:27:01.361 --> 02:27:03.670
<v Speaker 6>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So where would explain it?</v>

3328
02:27:03.710 --> 02:27:05.280
<v Speaker 6>Like where are you coming from?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like just try to.</v>

3329
02:27:05.290 --> 02:27:07.500
<v Speaker 6>I try to do it with no judgment.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I try to just like really</v>

3330
02:27:07.600 --> 02:27:09.430
<v Speaker 5>get into bed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So when you,</v>

3331
02:27:09.670 --> 02:27:14.670
<v Speaker 5>when you do take opinions and you do</v>
<v Speaker 5>analyze it and come down and say x is</v>

3332
02:27:15.041 --> 02:27:16.450
<v Speaker 5>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I believe x is wrong.</v>

3333
02:27:16.870 --> 02:27:20.320
<v Speaker 5>Do you</v>
<v Speaker 5>read your twitter feed?</v>

3334
02:27:20.880 --> 02:27:23.920
<v Speaker 5>Do you like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because it seems like anytime you're in</v>

3335
02:27:23.921 --> 02:27:28.280
<v Speaker 5>something public and you side anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3336
02:27:28.390 --> 02:27:31.510
<v Speaker 5>one issue and you go this way or that</v>
<v Speaker 5>way you're getting attacked.</v>

3337
02:27:32.260 --> 02:27:33.160
<v Speaker 5>Do you have That?</v>

3338
02:27:33.430 --> 02:27:34.570
<v Speaker 6>You would definitely have that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3339
02:27:34.620 --> 02:27:36.940
<v Speaker 6>I've got the end.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you take it to heart or you're just</v>

3340
02:27:36.950 --> 02:27:37.271
<v Speaker 6>like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

3341
02:27:37.271 --> 02:27:39.160
<v Speaker 6>these people just exist and that's just</v>
<v Speaker 6>the way.</v>

3342
02:27:39.500 --> 02:27:42.260
<v Speaker 6>I mean I analyze myself.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean I'll,</v>

3343
02:27:42.261 --> 02:27:43.600
<v Speaker 6>I'll listen to some of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

3344
02:27:43.620 --> 02:27:44.770
<v Speaker 6>if it's valid,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know,</v>

3345
02:27:44.771 --> 02:27:46.810
<v Speaker 6>I definitely know I fucked up before.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sure.</v>

3346
02:27:46.840 --> 02:27:49.780
<v Speaker 6>and when I have fucked up before I've</v>
<v Speaker 6>read things that people said that it</v>

3347
02:27:49.781 --> 02:27:52.270
<v Speaker 6>didn't feel good to read it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I knew that they were probably</v>

3348
02:27:52.310 --> 02:27:54.020
<v Speaker 6>right.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And so you just,</v>

3349
02:27:54.460 --> 02:27:56.710
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you're doing a live show and you're</v>

3350
02:27:57.010 --> 02:27:59.220
<v Speaker 6>just kind of free balling the time and</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's.</v>

3351
02:27:59.610 --> 02:28:02.650
<v Speaker 6>And sometimes comedy and sometimes it's</v>
<v Speaker 6>just,</v>

3352
02:28:02.680 --> 02:28:05.530
<v Speaker 6>sometimes it gets heated,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sometimes there's booze involved in</v>

3353
02:28:06.430 --> 02:28:07.830
<v Speaker 6>lows,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but um,</v>

3354
02:28:08.170 --> 02:28:09.490
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean it's just,</v>

3355
02:28:10.060 --> 02:28:12.130
<v Speaker 6>are you trying to get better all the</v>
<v Speaker 6>time trying to do it better,</v>

3356
02:28:12.160 --> 02:28:12.370
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

3357
02:28:12.370 --> 02:28:15.180
<v Speaker 6>If you are,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is just the part of the process and</v>

3358
02:28:15.181 --> 02:28:17.890
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's value in feedback,</v>

3359
02:28:18.250 --> 02:28:22.670
<v Speaker 6>but there's also you have to understand</v>
<v Speaker 6>like how many people would you know,</v>

3360
02:28:22.940 --> 02:28:25.520
<v Speaker 6>how many people are just trolling you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how many people don't like you for</v>

3361
02:28:25.521 --> 02:28:27.280
<v Speaker 6>whatever reason,</v>
<v Speaker 6>how many people just go,</v>

3362
02:28:27.290 --> 02:28:29.870
<v Speaker 6>I've gone to people's pages,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they'll say something insulting and you</v>

3363
02:28:29.871 --> 02:28:31.940
<v Speaker 6>go to their page and it's just them</v>
<v Speaker 6>insulting everybody.</v>

3364
02:28:32.470 --> 02:28:35.300
<v Speaker 6>Anybody they can.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know there's some people that choose</v>

3365
02:28:35.301 --> 02:28:37.220
<v Speaker 6>to do that with their time and hey,</v>
<v Speaker 6>this is America.</v>

3366
02:28:37.221 --> 02:28:41.540
<v Speaker 6>You're allowed to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But I think overall the more time goes</v>

3367
02:28:41.541 --> 02:28:44.450
<v Speaker 6>on,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the less I spend looking at any of that</v>

3368
02:28:44.451 --> 02:28:47.630
<v Speaker 6>shit the better off I am.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I'm less likely to look at that shit</v>

3369
02:28:47.640 --> 02:28:49.040
<v Speaker 6>now than I ever have before.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3370
02:28:49.680 --> 02:28:51.150
<v Speaker 5>It's just a.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3371
02:28:51.151 --> 02:28:54.720
<v Speaker 5>because like you say,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like some of it you want to see.</v>

3372
02:28:54.721 --> 02:28:56.490
<v Speaker 5>And it is good feedback and like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3373
02:28:56.491 --> 02:28:58.170
<v Speaker 5>there is a good rapport like with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3374
02:28:58.800 --> 02:29:03.090
<v Speaker 5>and then other people just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they make it almost impossible to find</v>

3375
02:29:03.091 --> 02:29:07.410
<v Speaker 5>the good ones because it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just because you said one word and look,</v>

3376
02:29:07.860 --> 02:29:09.930
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're comedians were just curious.</v>

3377
02:29:09.931 --> 02:29:11.640
<v Speaker 5>People were always trying to figure</v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff out.</v>

3378
02:29:12.090 --> 02:29:13.620
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're very similar in that we're not</v>

3379
02:29:13.740 --> 02:29:16.410
<v Speaker 5>down on neither any one side,</v>
<v Speaker 5>any one team.</v>

3380
02:29:16.650 --> 02:29:20.040
<v Speaker 5>We're really trying to figure out life</v>
<v Speaker 5>and try to figure things out.</v>

3381
02:29:20.940 --> 02:29:24.000
<v Speaker 5>So you're allowed to try and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't think this is right or I don't</v>

3382
02:29:24.001 --> 02:29:24.930
<v Speaker 5>think that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then.</v>

3383
02:29:25.110 --> 02:29:29.400
<v Speaker 5>But the teams,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people from the teams just pounce.</v>

3384
02:29:29.770 --> 02:29:30.750
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you can't think that way.</v>

3385
02:29:30.960 --> 02:29:32.640
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm trying to figure it out.</v>

3386
02:29:32.641 --> 02:29:35.760
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if this is a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>an oil grab.</v>

3387
02:29:35.761 --> 02:29:37.800
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if this is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but don't you think that's also what</v>

3388
02:29:37.801 --> 02:29:38.290
<v Speaker 5>makes,</v>

3389
02:29:38.290 --> 02:29:40.730
<v Speaker 6>um,</v>
<v Speaker 6>social in social media and interaction</v>

3390
02:29:40.731 --> 02:29:43.670
<v Speaker 6>with people so interesting is that</v>
<v Speaker 6>people can throw their opinion to the</v>

3391
02:29:43.700 --> 02:29:45.830
<v Speaker 6>ring,</v>
<v Speaker 6>throw their hat into the ring as a word.</v>

3392
02:29:45.831 --> 02:29:46.291
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like they,</v>

3393
02:29:46.291 --> 02:29:50.060
<v Speaker 6>they read something that you say or they</v>
<v Speaker 6>heard something that you said in a clip</v>

3394
02:29:50.061 --> 02:29:51.410
<v Speaker 6>and then they,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they argue with you about it.</v>

3395
02:29:51.900 --> 02:29:53.110
<v Speaker 5>If it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if it's,</v>

3396
02:29:53.710 --> 02:29:54.543
<v Speaker 5>if it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3397
02:29:55.700 --> 02:29:57.130
<v Speaker 5>a smart argument.</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3398
02:29:57.550 --> 02:29:59.800
<v Speaker 5>Not just a knee jerk,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3399
02:29:59.920 --> 02:30:02.500
<v Speaker 5>I hope you die because you said that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know what I mean?</v>

3400
02:30:03.010 --> 02:30:04.420
<v Speaker 5>You'd love to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3401
02:30:04.960 --> 02:30:06.850
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's some of the best conversations</v>

3402
02:30:06.851 --> 02:30:10.750
<v Speaker 5>you can have or when you don't agree</v>
<v Speaker 5>with somebody and you're just kind of</v>

3403
02:30:10.751 --> 02:30:12.580
<v Speaker 5>like going back into cam,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get here,</v>

3404
02:30:12.850 --> 02:30:14.220
<v Speaker 5>but it's not insulting.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3405
02:30:14.240 --> 02:30:15.250
<v Speaker 5>That's the big key.</v>

3406
02:30:15.620 --> 02:30:18.830
<v Speaker 6>And it's also you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you explore why you believe</v>

3407
02:30:18.831 --> 02:30:21.740
<v Speaker 6>something and I believe something</v>
<v Speaker 6>different and you go back and forth</v>

3408
02:30:21.741 --> 02:30:23.720
<v Speaker 6>over.</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you do do it respectful and you do</v>

3409
02:30:23.721 --> 02:30:26.930
<v Speaker 6>get to understand where that person's</v>
<v Speaker 6>coming from,</v>

3410
02:30:27.350 --> 02:30:31.370
<v Speaker 6>sometimes it makes it even more obvious</v>
<v Speaker 6>to everybody listening and to you that</v>

3411
02:30:31.371 --> 02:30:36.371
<v Speaker 6>they're wrong or that you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Whatever the fucking honest answer is it</v>

3412
02:30:36.711 --> 02:30:38.990
<v Speaker 6>gets.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It gets sort of illuminated and it</v>

3413
02:30:38.991 --> 02:30:41.630
<v Speaker 6>doesn't get illuminated.</v>
<v Speaker 6>When you get locked up in this battle,</v>

3414
02:30:42.060 --> 02:30:46.250
<v Speaker 6>there's people that will form sides,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but if you can get to the objective bow</v>

3415
02:30:46.251 --> 02:30:47.060
<v Speaker 6>k,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what?</v>

3416
02:30:47.060 --> 02:30:50.660
<v Speaker 6>What makes you believe that that is true</v>
<v Speaker 6>and then they tell you and you go,</v>

3417
02:30:50.661 --> 02:30:52.370
<v Speaker 6>well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that is actually not true.</v>

3418
02:30:52.520 --> 02:30:55.010
<v Speaker 6>Let's find the facts or I didn't know</v>
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

3419
02:30:55.310 --> 02:30:59.060
<v Speaker 6>Now I'm looking at my initial position</v>
<v Speaker 6>different in life and don't be married</v>

3420
02:30:59.061 --> 02:31:01.490
<v Speaker 6>to that initial position because it's</v>
<v Speaker 6>just an opinion,</v>

3421
02:31:01.760 --> 02:31:05.330
<v Speaker 6>but opinions to us are almost like</v>
<v Speaker 6>markers of our self esteem.</v>

3422
02:31:05.331 --> 02:31:09.200
<v Speaker 6>If you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you can't defend that position,</v>

3423
02:31:09.650 --> 02:31:12.310
<v Speaker 6>then you fucked up initially and you're</v>
<v Speaker 6>in the year,</v>

3424
02:31:12.311 --> 02:31:16.090
<v Speaker 6>you're flawed so people like dig in and</v>
<v Speaker 6>they try to defend that position and</v>

3425
02:31:16.091 --> 02:31:18.860
<v Speaker 6>even when they know it logically,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it doesn't make sense.</v>

3426
02:31:18.861 --> 02:31:20.100
<v Speaker 6>It's like they get married to it</v>

3427
02:31:20.100 --> 02:31:22.770
<v Speaker 4>and even if you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're with somebody and you're engaged</v>

3428
02:31:22.771 --> 02:31:26.040
<v Speaker 4>and you're having this real back and</v>
<v Speaker 4>forth about something and you both are</v>

3429
02:31:26.041 --> 02:31:29.370
<v Speaker 4>dealing with the facts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you still have your opinion that now</v>

3430
02:31:29.371 --> 02:31:33.630
<v Speaker 4>I'm still siding with this way and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 4>siding with that way you can still</v>

3431
02:31:33.690 --> 02:31:34.820
<v Speaker 4>respect each other.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3432
02:31:35.250 --> 02:31:38.700
<v Speaker 4>It's when you go,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when it becomes this personal insult is</v>

3433
02:31:38.701 --> 02:31:40.110
<v Speaker 4>where you lose it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3434
02:31:40.111 --> 02:31:41.640
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know people in my family,</v>

3435
02:31:41.641 --> 02:31:43.770
<v Speaker 4>people you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I work with whatever,</v>

3436
02:31:44.040 --> 02:31:46.920
<v Speaker 4>who have total different views,</v>
<v Speaker 4>vote differently,</v>

3437
02:31:46.921 --> 02:31:48.150
<v Speaker 4>act differently,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do whatever,</v>

3438
02:31:48.450 --> 02:31:51.570
<v Speaker 4>but I love them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're just great people and you can't,</v>

3439
02:31:51.600 --> 02:31:54.630
<v Speaker 4>they're to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you shouldn't have to dissolve</v>

3440
02:31:54.631 --> 02:31:58.620
<v Speaker 4>relationships because of a political</v>
<v Speaker 4>point of view about a certain issue.</v>

3441
02:31:59.110 --> 02:32:00.300
<v Speaker 4>There's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

3442
02:32:00.600 --> 02:32:02.750
<v Speaker 4>that's what's so great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>my whole family was like,</v>

3443
02:32:03.090 --> 02:32:05.190
<v Speaker 4>my grandfather was hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3444
02:32:05.191 --> 02:32:07.500
<v Speaker 4>My uncle was hard left and they would</v>
<v Speaker 4>argue and fight,</v>

3445
02:32:07.740 --> 02:32:10.320
<v Speaker 4>but they loved each other and everybody</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of got along and just ate the</v>

3446
02:32:10.321 --> 02:32:11.820
<v Speaker 4>potatoes after the argument.</v>

3447
02:32:12.390 --> 02:32:13.590
<v Speaker 4>Some people can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

3448
02:32:13.591 --> 02:32:15.060
<v Speaker 4>So you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you don't agree with them,</v>

3449
02:32:15.061 --> 02:32:16.560
<v Speaker 4>you can't hang out with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3450
02:32:16.590 --> 02:32:17.970
<v Speaker 4>like about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3451
02:32:18.810 --> 02:32:21.450
<v Speaker 4>And then some people will have like</v>
<v Speaker 4>these crazy arguments where you just</v>

3452
02:32:21.600 --> 02:32:24.060
<v Speaker 4>can't be right or wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't know what you're talking about</v>

3453
02:32:24.061 --> 02:32:27.900
<v Speaker 4>and you're still like climate change.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How many people have you talked to that?</v>

3454
02:32:27.901 --> 02:32:30.750
<v Speaker 4>We'll just go hard one way or the other</v>
<v Speaker 4>on climate change.</v>

3455
02:32:30.751 --> 02:32:32.940
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then when you start talking to them</v>

3456
02:32:32.941 --> 02:32:34.590
<v Speaker 4>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you actually ask them,</v>

3457
02:32:34.591 --> 02:32:38.670
<v Speaker 4>what makes you think that climate change</v>
<v Speaker 4>is just a cycle and that human beings</v>

3458
02:32:38.671 --> 02:32:42.480
<v Speaker 4>are not involved and it's been shown</v>
<v Speaker 4>that it's been a lot of the data has</v>

3459
02:32:42.481 --> 02:32:45.150
<v Speaker 4>been hoaxed and a lot of the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then if you just go deeper,</v>

3460
02:32:45.151 --> 02:32:46.620
<v Speaker 4>deeper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>deeper down the rabbit hole,</v>

3461
02:32:46.621 --> 02:32:48.450
<v Speaker 4>you find that they haven't looked into</v>
<v Speaker 4>it that much.</v>

3462
02:32:48.480 --> 02:32:51.570
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very few people arguing pr pro or</v>

3463
02:32:51.571 --> 02:32:54.660
<v Speaker 4>against manmade climate change have</v>
<v Speaker 4>really looked into it.</v>

3464
02:32:54.910 --> 02:32:58.830
<v Speaker 4>Most people are just sort of taking the</v>
<v Speaker 4>consensus view that they hear from</v>

3465
02:32:58.831 --> 02:33:00.940
<v Speaker 4>scientists are from pundits or from</v>
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>

3466
02:33:01.760 --> 02:33:04.260
<v Speaker 4>And if you were on the left,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're most likely thinking that we're</v>

3467
02:33:04.261 --> 02:33:06.120
<v Speaker 4>in deep trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you're on the right,</v>

3468
02:33:06.240 --> 02:33:07.950
<v Speaker 4>you're more likely to dismiss it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3469
02:33:08.220 --> 02:33:11.410
<v Speaker 4>I mean that's why.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Back to why we need grownups to like</v>

3470
02:33:11.430 --> 02:33:15.060
<v Speaker 4>control some of the news and give you</v>
<v Speaker 4>facts so you can kind of decide stuff.</v>

3471
02:33:15.061 --> 02:33:19.290
<v Speaker 4>It's because you don't have the time to</v>
<v Speaker 4>research climate change on your own.</v>

3472
02:33:19.291 --> 02:33:22.500
<v Speaker 4>You've got kids,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got a dog that's got a wants you</v>

3473
02:33:22.501 --> 02:33:25.620
<v Speaker 4>to whack off with the two.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot going on in your life,</v>

3474
02:33:25.650 --> 02:33:30.650
<v Speaker 4>so you depend on others who are really,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who are invested in giving you the right</v>

3475
02:33:30.781 --> 02:33:31.470
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>

3476
02:33:31.470 --> 02:33:34.890
<v Speaker 4>So what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you tell them that they have to just</v>

3477
02:33:34.891 --> 02:33:35.910
<v Speaker 4>say like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

3478
02:33:35.911 --> 02:33:37.440
<v Speaker 4>if you're going to call something in</v>
<v Speaker 4>news,</v>

3479
02:33:37.441 --> 02:33:41.250
<v Speaker 4>should we have like a thing where</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a,</v>

3480
02:33:41.320 --> 02:33:45.990
<v Speaker 4>you have to like meet a standard of</v>
<v Speaker 4>ingredients like we looked at your</v>

3481
02:33:45.991 --> 02:33:48.450
<v Speaker 4>ingredients and you have trans fats in</v>
<v Speaker 4>your news,</v>

3482
02:33:48.520 --> 02:33:50.580
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have all this other bullshit like</v>

3483
02:33:50.581 --> 02:33:52.020
<v Speaker 4>this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He can't sell this as food,</v>

3484
02:33:52.830 --> 02:33:55.430
<v Speaker 4>not news.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can't make this fit should be.</v>

3485
02:33:55.920 --> 02:33:58.680
<v Speaker 4>It should be because like for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for like hannity to say I'm a talk show</v>

3486
02:33:58.681 --> 02:34:00.020
<v Speaker 4>host,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's fine.</v>

3487
02:34:00.360 --> 02:34:02.880
<v Speaker 4>More power to you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but then there should be a thing,</v>

3488
02:34:02.881 --> 02:34:06.960
<v Speaker 4>a little logo in the corner that says</v>
<v Speaker 4>opinion show,</v>

3489
02:34:06.990 --> 02:34:07.560
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The little.</v>

3490
02:34:07.560 --> 02:34:09.990
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and then there should be an n on the top</v>

3491
02:34:09.991 --> 02:34:12.870
<v Speaker 4>of the whatever show that just giving</v>
<v Speaker 4>you facts for the day.</v>

3492
02:34:12.890 --> 02:34:15.360
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The problem really is calling it a news</v>

3493
02:34:15.361 --> 02:34:17.680
<v Speaker 4>network and having an opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People on a news network.</v>

3494
02:34:17.681 --> 02:34:18.310
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

3495
02:34:18.310 --> 02:34:20.830

<v Speaker 6>cooper when he's rolling his eyes at</v>

02:34:25.811 --> 02:34:28.450
<v Speaker 6>maybe he's correct that what she's</v>
<v Speaker 6>saying is ridiculous,</v>

3500
02:34:28.451 --> 02:34:30.640
<v Speaker 6>but he's clearly editorializing by doing</v>
<v Speaker 6>that.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>

<v Speaker 6>the poor have their coffee and they're</v>
<v Speaker 6>sitting there drinking the side of the</v>

3550

3570
02:37:20.650 --> 02:37:22.510
<v Speaker 5>my shitty New York apartment because.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

3571
02:37:22.800 --> 02:37:24.210
<v Speaker 5>because they didn't have a good coffee</v>
<v Speaker 5>maker.</v>

3572
02:37:24.211 --> 02:37:24.641
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these,</v>

3573
02:37:24.641 --> 02:37:25.490
<v Speaker 5>this will do me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well</v>

3574
02:37:25.700 --> 02:37:27.050
<v Speaker 6>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if you want to make coffee,</v>

3575
02:37:27.051 --> 02:37:29.540
<v Speaker 6>if you're at home,</v>
<v Speaker 6>all you need is a french press.</v>

3576
02:37:29.541 --> 02:37:32.570
<v Speaker 6>That is the way that he has a way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It is the best.</v>

3577
02:37:32.600 --> 02:37:35.030
<v Speaker 6>It's a little mucky cleanup.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

3578
02:37:35.031 --> 02:37:38.120
<v Speaker 6>I guess that's where it's at,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but it's a few steps,</v>

3579
02:37:38.180 --> 02:37:42.950
<v Speaker 6>but the oils from the coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like if you're a person who enjoys the</v>

3580
02:37:42.951 --> 02:37:45.380
<v Speaker 6>actual flavor,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no milk,</v>

3581
02:37:45.381 --> 02:37:48.710
<v Speaker 6>no nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just give it to me like a man.</v>

3582
02:37:48.711 --> 02:37:51.860
<v Speaker 6>That's what I would drink it these days</v>
<v Speaker 6>and I get way less complaints on the</v>

3583
02:37:51.861 --> 02:37:54.270
<v Speaker 6>podcast about me clearing my throat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

3584
02:37:54.380 --> 02:37:55.640
<v Speaker 6>That was a problem before.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why?</v>

3585
02:37:55.641 --> 02:37:58.880
<v Speaker 6>Because you had stuff in the coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I drink bulletproof coffee with butter</v>

3586
02:37:58.881 --> 02:38:03.230
<v Speaker 6>and mct oil and it was making you flemmi</v>
<v Speaker 6>that butter coffee makes you super</v>

3587
02:38:03.231 --> 02:38:04.064
<v Speaker 6>fleming.</v>
<v Speaker 6>That'd be like,</v>

3588
02:38:04.340 --> 02:38:06.200
<v Speaker 5>what am I drinking here?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Black coffee.</v>

3589
02:38:06.230 --> 02:38:08.660
<v Speaker 5>Just black man coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The best sabretooth roast.</v>

3590
02:38:08.730 --> 02:38:11.360
<v Speaker 5>it's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>god damn savage was good.</v>

3591
02:38:11.510 --> 02:38:13.880
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>now there's those moments are really</v>

3592
02:38:13.881 --> 02:38:17.240
<v Speaker 5>important in life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really believe like those little quiet</v>

3593
02:38:17.900 --> 02:38:20.900
<v Speaker 5>things that have been passed on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if things had been around for</v>

3594
02:38:20.901 --> 02:38:24.830
<v Speaker 5>thousands of years and people have</v>
<v Speaker 5>figured it out the cocktail hour,</v>

3595
02:38:25.100 --> 02:38:26.570
<v Speaker 5>the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the quiet moment,</v>

3596
02:38:26.740 --> 02:38:29.500
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>before bed or in the morning when you're</v>

3597
02:38:29.510 --> 02:38:31.880
<v Speaker 5>having your coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those things are figured out for a</v>

3598
02:38:31.881 --> 02:38:35.130
<v Speaker 5>reason.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There people have figured out this is</v>

3599
02:38:35.150 --> 02:38:36.650
<v Speaker 5>the way to live,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is,</v>

3600
02:38:37.250 --> 02:38:38.870
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it really is.</v>

3601
02:38:39.290 --> 02:38:40.820
<v Speaker 5>It really is the way to live.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3602
02:38:40.821 --> 02:38:43.850
<v Speaker 5>And if you could pull it off and they're</v>
<v Speaker 5>so small and they're so deep and they're</v>

3603
02:38:43.851 --> 02:38:45.710
<v Speaker 5>so valuable,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know what I mean?</v>

3604
02:38:45.860 --> 02:38:48.170
<v Speaker 5>it's not a giant trip to vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not,</v>

3605
02:38:48.410 --> 02:38:50.600
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've got to make a million dollars.</v>

3606
02:38:50.960 --> 02:38:53.630
<v Speaker 5>It's sitting with your pipe and a</v>
<v Speaker 5>coffee.</v>

3607
02:38:54.020 --> 02:38:58.340
<v Speaker 5>that simple little thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>so much better for your soul.</v>

3608
02:38:58.520 --> 02:39:03.520
<v Speaker 5>Then all this giant stuff that we end up</v>
<v Speaker 5>chasing small.</v>

3609
02:39:04.710 --> 02:39:05.810
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Um,</v>

3610
02:39:06.180 --> 02:39:09.960
<v Speaker 6>I was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>interviewing dr robert sapolsky</v>

3611
02:39:09.961 --> 02:39:13.080
<v Speaker 6>yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 6>famous scientist and one of the things I</v>

3612
02:39:13.081 --> 02:39:15.390
<v Speaker 6>was doing is going over some of his</v>
<v Speaker 6>work,</v>

3613
02:39:15.720 --> 02:39:18.960
<v Speaker 6>listening to some of his previous</v>
<v Speaker 6>interviews and reading some of his</v>

3614
02:39:18.961 --> 02:39:22.140
<v Speaker 6>articles and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And he had this thing about meditation.</v>

3615
02:39:22.380 --> 02:39:23.640
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And essentially one of the things that</v>

3616
02:39:23.641 --> 02:39:26.550
<v Speaker 6>we're saying about meditation is like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it can be effective,</v>

3617
02:39:26.551 --> 02:39:29.850
<v Speaker 6>but you have to do it all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like it's not something you can do once</v>

3618
02:39:29.851 --> 02:39:31.650
<v Speaker 6>a week.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like meditation is something that should</v>

3619
02:39:31.651 --> 02:39:34.500
<v Speaker 6>become a daily part of your routine.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then you can,</v>

3620
02:39:34.501 --> 02:39:37.410
<v Speaker 6>it'll help you mitigate stress,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think it's twice a day.</v>

3621
02:39:37.900 --> 02:39:39.600
<v Speaker 6>once a day.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He didn't specify,</v>

3622
02:39:39.990 --> 02:39:41.190
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>he's talking about all the different</v>

3623
02:39:41.191 --> 02:39:43.680
<v Speaker 6>forms that it takes to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a bunch of different kinds and</v>

3624
02:39:43.681 --> 02:39:47.150
<v Speaker 6>there's not necessarily one that works</v>
<v Speaker 6>best one,</v>

3625
02:39:47.370 --> 02:39:49.410
<v Speaker 6>but I think that what you're doing when</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're making your bread,</v>

3626
02:39:49.411 --> 02:39:51.180
<v Speaker 6>I think that's a meditation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I really do.</v>

3627
02:39:51.460 --> 02:39:52.960
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>In a weird way.</v>

3628
02:39:53.680 --> 02:39:57.520
<v Speaker 5>It's not like when I really meditate and</v>
<v Speaker 5>you sit for 20 minutes and you don't</v>

3629
02:39:57.521 --> 02:39:59.350
<v Speaker 5>slow,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like it slows your heart rate,</v>

3630
02:39:59.351 --> 02:40:00.970
<v Speaker 5>it says,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you're not asleep.</v>

3631
02:40:01.000 --> 02:40:04.030
<v Speaker 5>It actually calms you deeper than sleep.</v>

3632
02:40:04.670 --> 02:40:07.370
<v Speaker 6>I used to and I still do call martial</v>
<v Speaker 6>arts,</v>

3633
02:40:07.371 --> 02:40:12.230
<v Speaker 6>moving meditation because martial arts</v>
<v Speaker 6>make you think so much about the</v>

3634
02:40:12.231 --> 02:40:14.100
<v Speaker 6>movements and about what you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So</v>

3635
02:40:14.100 --> 02:40:18.150
<v Speaker 1>much inTensity and so much danger</v>
<v Speaker 1>involved in them that they make you have</v>

3636
02:40:18.151 --> 02:40:21.930
<v Speaker 1>like very singular focus and then in</v>
<v Speaker 1>that singular focus there's some sort of</v>

3637
02:40:21.931 --> 02:40:26.931
<v Speaker 1>a cleansing that happens with your mind</v>
<v Speaker 1>by just going hard at these things.</v>

3638
02:40:28.351 --> 02:40:33.351
<v Speaker 1>It relieves stress in a way completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>that uber focus on anything.</v>

3639
02:40:33.451 --> 02:40:34.500
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like when I used to,</v>

3640
02:40:34.560 --> 02:40:39.360
<v Speaker 1>when I had a motorcycle and my father</v>
<v Speaker 1>still does it and you know,</v>

3641
02:40:39.410 --> 02:40:40.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's his thing like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3642
02:40:40.991 --> 02:40:44.430
<v Speaker 1>I've comedy and other things to put my</v>
<v Speaker 1>mind into,</v>

3643
02:40:45.420 --> 02:40:47.130
<v Speaker 1>but he still does it and I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3644
02:40:47.131 --> 02:40:49.170
<v Speaker 1>when you're on that bike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's your survival.</v>

3645
02:40:49.200 --> 02:40:52.080
<v Speaker 1>Where's your dad live?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lives in New York city?</v>

3646
02:40:52.170 --> 02:40:53.003
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3647
02:40:53.010 --> 02:40:55.140
<v Speaker 1>upstate New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So is he in a place where you could ride</v>

3648
02:40:55.141 --> 02:40:56.670
<v Speaker 1>a bike and not worry about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3649
02:40:56.730 --> 02:40:59.960
<v Speaker 1>It's not like running you over whether</v>
<v Speaker 1>texting,</v>

3650
02:40:59.990 --> 02:41:00.870
<v Speaker 1>but he goes everywhere.</v>

3651
02:41:00.870 --> 02:41:02.580
<v Speaker 1>He goes on these trips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3652
02:41:03.180 --> 02:41:06.090
<v Speaker 1>excuse me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>up all the way in mostly east coast,</v>

3653
02:41:06.091 --> 02:41:07.950
<v Speaker 1>but he's done all of europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's done all of the.</v>

3654
02:41:07.960 --> 02:41:10.120
<v Speaker 1>You ever wipe out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3655
02:41:10.230 --> 02:41:11.940
<v Speaker 1>they never wiped out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never wiped out.</v>

3656
02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:13.090
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3657
02:41:13.260 --> 02:41:14.520
<v Speaker 1>that's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3658
02:41:14.850 --> 02:41:17.530
<v Speaker 1>How'd you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're the only guy I've ever heard of a</v>

3659
02:41:17.560 --> 02:41:18.750
<v Speaker 1>really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

3660
02:41:18.990 --> 02:41:22.710
<v Speaker 1>I was uber safe as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I could be,</v>

3661
02:41:22.711 --> 02:41:24.360
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still dependent on other people,</v>

3662
02:41:24.361 --> 02:41:29.361
<v Speaker 1>but the only time I fell over was my</v>
<v Speaker 1>wife and I pulled into a days inn in</v>

3663
02:41:31.021 --> 02:41:33.510
<v Speaker 1>like Kansas and we'd done a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>highway,</v>

3664
02:41:33.511 --> 02:41:34.690
<v Speaker 1>just straight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3665
02:41:35.820 --> 02:41:40.770
<v Speaker 1>hours just going and we pulled up to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>days inn and the routine was we'd pull</v>

3666
02:41:40.771 --> 02:41:44.220
<v Speaker 1>in at the end of the day and she would</v>
<v Speaker 1>go into check into the hotel and I would</v>

3667
02:41:44.221 --> 02:41:48.540
<v Speaker 1>take care of the bike and we pulled into</v>
<v Speaker 1>a days in and she got,</v>

3668
02:41:48.750 --> 02:41:52.800
<v Speaker 1>she hopped off the bike and I just never</v>
<v Speaker 1>took my feet off the pegs because I was</v>

3669
02:41:52.801 --> 02:41:56.630
<v Speaker 1>so tired and I just like benny hill just</v>
<v Speaker 1>slowly tipped over,</v>

3670
02:41:57.300 --> 02:42:00.990
<v Speaker 1>get her now the bar kind of caught it.</v>

3671
02:42:01.190 --> 02:42:04.710
<v Speaker 1>It just feels like a nub.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's pretty good.</v>

3672
02:42:05.010 --> 02:42:07.790
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As far as like all the friends,</v>

3673
02:42:07.960 --> 02:42:12.150
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I went with a couple of friends from</v>

3674
02:42:12.151 --> 02:42:14.370
<v Speaker 1>fear factor were all taken at the same</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

3675
02:42:14.790 --> 02:42:16.860
<v Speaker 1>Motorcycle safety course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>

3676
02:42:16.920 --> 02:42:20.610
<v Speaker 1>While I was doing it to people I know</v>
<v Speaker 1>got in car accidents on motorcycles.</v>

3677
02:42:21.060 --> 02:42:21.840
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3678
02:42:21.840 --> 02:42:25.350
<v Speaker 1>And then one person I know saw a person</v>
<v Speaker 1>get hit,</v>

3679
02:42:25.351 --> 02:42:29.730
<v Speaker 1>saw someone stays out on their phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ran into some guy from behind,</v>

3680
02:42:29.731 --> 02:42:32.740
<v Speaker 1>so flying through the air just just hit</v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

3681
02:42:32.750 --> 02:42:34.830
<v Speaker 1>He just bang.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's terrible.</v>

3682
02:42:34.890 --> 02:42:36.510
<v Speaker 1>I know I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was lucky,</v>

3683
02:42:36.511 --> 02:42:39.810
<v Speaker 1>but once I came out here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had it in New York city for a long</v>

3684
02:42:39.811 --> 02:42:41.520
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was kind of manageable.</v>

3685
02:42:41.521 --> 02:42:46.020
<v Speaker 1>I would do like spots me and greg</v>
<v Speaker 1>giraldo would go between clubs and it</v>

3686
02:42:46.021 --> 02:42:47.880
<v Speaker 1>was night,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was kind of a little more mellow</v>

3687
02:42:47.881 --> 02:42:49.590
<v Speaker 1>and it was all right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But once I came out here I was like,</v>

3688
02:42:49.600 --> 02:42:53.250
<v Speaker 1>there's no way I just had kids and my</v>
<v Speaker 1>career was starting to go.</v>

3689
02:42:53.251 --> 02:42:54.120
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

3690
02:42:54.150 --> 02:42:55.680
<v Speaker 1>there's too much to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

3692
02:42:59.220 --> 02:43:01.320

<v Speaker 1>everybody drives out here too,</v>

3693
02:43:01.530 --> 02:43:03.660
<v Speaker 1>as opposed to in New York.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are professionals.</v>

3694

<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Our bodies are gross.</v>

3799
02:47:45.290 --> 02:47:47.990

<v Speaker 4>A beer here knows hair.</v>

3808
02:48:08.890 --> 02:48:09.723
<v Speaker 4>I'm covered.</v>

3809
02:48:10.980 --> 02:48:13.970
<v Speaker 1>I'm like a bear except where we want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3810
02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:17.420
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a barbara and old italian barber</v>

3811
02:48:17.480 --> 02:48:22.480
<v Speaker 1>shave my ears when I was 15.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just put like he took lotion shaving</v>

3812
02:48:23.030 --> 02:48:25.300
<v Speaker 1>stuff and put it on my ears and shave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great razor.</v>

3813
02:48:25.450 --> 02:48:28.820
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And ever since then just weeds growing</v>

3814
02:48:28.821 --> 02:48:30.920
<v Speaker 1>out of my ears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3815
02:48:30.970 --> 02:48:34.280
<v Speaker 1>I totally work that just grew that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>

3816
02:48:35.030 --> 02:48:37.820
<v Speaker 1>That's why we shaving your ears at 15.</v>
<v Speaker 1>most kids don't have to get the fucking</v>

3817
02:48:37.900 --> 02:48:41.210
<v Speaker 1>marriage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're 15 your goddamn little wolf.</v>

3818
02:48:41.211 --> 02:48:44.050
<v Speaker 1>Boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like michael j.</v>

3819
02:48:44.050 --> 02:48:44.883
<v Speaker 1>Fox in that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

3820
02:48:44.900 --> 02:48:47.990
<v Speaker 1>but it was soft little fluffy hair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's like cactus</v>

3821
02:48:48.280 --> 02:48:49.101
<v Speaker 4>works that way.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>

3822
02:48:49.101 --> 02:48:51.740
<v Speaker 4>I don't think like when you shave it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't grow back thicker.</v>

3823
02:48:51.741 --> 02:48:54.020
<v Speaker 4>I think that's a myth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's true.</v>

3824
02:48:54.021 --> 02:48:55.700
<v Speaker 4>I think it definitely grows back</v>
<v Speaker 4>thicker.</v>

3825
02:48:55.730 --> 02:48:56.660
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3826
02:48:57.080 --> 02:48:59.490
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it does matter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think this came up the other day I was</v>

3827
02:48:59.540 --> 02:49:01.110
<v Speaker 4>on here if I saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

3828
02:49:01.490 --> 02:49:03.470
<v Speaker 4>definitely grows back then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm pretty sure it's a myth.</v>

3829
02:49:03.700 --> 02:49:06.640
<v Speaker 1>My wife started shaving her mustache.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

3830
02:49:08.710 --> 02:49:11.370
<v Speaker 1>john go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's a war.</v>

3831
02:49:11.371 --> 02:49:13.920
<v Speaker 1>We will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we hack away,</v>

3832
02:49:13.980 --> 02:49:16.770
<v Speaker 1>I've got a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a trimmer that goes inside the</v>

3833
02:49:16.771 --> 02:49:19.310
<v Speaker 1>ear and the nose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got out at the nose.</v>

3834
02:49:19.320 --> 02:49:21.480
<v Speaker 1>One thing I shaved with my regular</v>
<v Speaker 1>razor.</v>

3835
02:49:21.481 --> 02:49:24.210
<v Speaker 1>As I'm shaving my face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I shaved the back of my ears.</v>

3836
02:49:24.670 --> 02:49:27.660
<v Speaker 1>I am a hairy mess sometimes when I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>driving in my car,</v>

3837
02:49:27.780 --> 02:49:31.830
<v Speaker 1>I'll grab a finger full of notes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Terrace and all yank them out by the</v>

3838
02:49:31.831 --> 02:49:33.930
<v Speaker 1>roots feels good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very satisfying.</v>

3839
02:49:33.931 --> 02:49:37.290
<v Speaker 1>When I look and I see a bunch of hairs</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are pulled out of my nose,</v>

3840
02:49:37.320 --> 02:49:38.490
<v Speaker 1>you got to get a trimmer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3841
02:49:38.491 --> 02:49:41.180
<v Speaker 1>I know I do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes I can grab them and I'd</v>

3842
02:49:41.181 --> 02:49:45.030
<v Speaker 1>just like to grab my one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My one part of my back is heavier than</v>

3843
02:49:45.031 --> 02:49:45.930
<v Speaker 1>the other side</v>

3844
02:49:46.110 --> 02:49:48.600
<v Speaker 6>fact or fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If you shave or wax,</v>

3845
02:49:48.601 --> 02:49:52.740
<v Speaker 6>your hair will come back thicker and it</v>
<v Speaker 6>may look that way,</v>

3846
02:49:52.770 --> 02:49:55.920
<v Speaker 6>but it looks good.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't believe this science.</v>

3847
02:49:55.980 --> 02:49:56.910
<v Speaker 6>oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What the fuck.</v>

3848
02:49:56.930 --> 02:50:00.840
<v Speaker 6>In scientific America,</v>
<v Speaker 6>bunch of liberal nonsense that is simply</v>

3849
02:50:00.841 --> 02:50:03.780
<v Speaker 6>not so.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There are several reasons that the myth</v>

3850
02:50:03.781 --> 02:50:07.170
<v Speaker 6>continues to flourish.</v>
<v Speaker 6>One is the limitation of human</v>

3851
02:50:07.171 --> 02:50:09.720
<v Speaker 6>perception.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People are just not very good observers,</v>

3852
02:50:09.721 --> 02:50:13.590
<v Speaker 6>but there is no science.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just no scIence behind hair growing back</v>

3853
02:50:13.591 --> 02:50:15.260
<v Speaker 6>thicker says amy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>me,</v>

3854
02:50:15.310 --> 02:50:16.180
<v Speaker 6>michael.</v>
<v Speaker 6>first of all,</v>

3855
02:50:16.181 --> 02:50:20.070
<v Speaker 6>it's a girl which she know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>chair of the department of dermatology</v>

3856
02:50:20.071 --> 02:50:22.620
<v Speaker 6>at wake forest baptist health.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We're just kidding.</v>

3857
02:50:22.621 --> 02:50:24.120
<v Speaker 6>Amy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm sure you know a lot more than me.</v>

3858
02:50:24.450 --> 02:50:27.060
<v Speaker 6>There's also the power of coincidence.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Indeed.</v>

3859
02:50:27.061 --> 02:50:29.880
<v Speaker 6>Pervasive myths.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If a young boy shaves his mustache,</v>

3860
02:50:29.890 --> 02:50:32.490
<v Speaker 6>will grow back thicker,</v>
<v Speaker 6>are grounded in a kernel of truth,</v>

3861
02:50:32.520 --> 02:50:34.920
<v Speaker 6>it might,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that's because the shaving may</v>

3862
02:50:34.921 --> 02:50:39.690
<v Speaker 6>overlap with the timing of natural</v>
<v Speaker 6>hormonal fluctuations in his body that</v>

3863
02:50:39.691 --> 02:50:43.230
<v Speaker 6>are developing his adult facial hair,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not because it was hair removal,</v>

3864
02:50:43.830 --> 02:50:46.320
<v Speaker 6>hair grows at different times and at</v>
<v Speaker 6>different rates.</v>

3865
02:50:46.321 --> 02:50:48.990
<v Speaker 6>For everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Case closed and papa.</v>

3866
02:50:49.470 --> 02:50:54.470
<v Speaker 1>I had little fuzzies on my ears and now</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have cactus barbs that hurt my wife in</v>

3867
02:50:56.371 --> 02:50:57.810
<v Speaker 1>our sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

3868
02:50:58.110 --> 02:50:59.130
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a hairy mess.</v>

3869
02:50:59.550 --> 02:51:04.550
<v Speaker 1>I had a birthmark on my left side of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>back when I was young and it faded,</v>

3870
02:51:05.040 --> 02:51:09.450
<v Speaker 1>but what's remained his hair?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So my right side is not very.</v>

3871
02:51:09.451 --> 02:51:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Harry has some here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this side is just like a jungle.</v>

3872
02:51:12.440 --> 02:51:13.550
<v Speaker 1>A patch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3873
02:51:13.770 --> 02:51:15.930
<v Speaker 1>I used to have a song for it when I was</v>
<v Speaker 1>in high school.</v>

3874
02:51:15.960 --> 02:51:17.790
<v Speaker 1>What was it?</v>

<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

<v Speaker 1>It's 4:30 already.</v>

3910
02:52:57.351 --> 02:52:58.720
<v Speaker 6>IT's a big.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Ask her to this.</v>

3911
02:52:58.810 --> 02:53:00.960
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm a big fan of these pellet smokers.</v>

3912
02:53:00.980 --> 02:53:03.970
<v Speaker 6>What I like about these yoders is this</v>
<v Speaker 6>is by the way,</v>

3913
02:53:04.840 --> 02:53:07.450
<v Speaker 6>not an endorsement.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I paid full price for this thing.</v>

3914
02:53:08.110 --> 02:53:09.790
<v Speaker 6>Didn't ask for.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It.</v>

3915
02:53:09.791 --> 02:53:11.680
<v Speaker 6>Looks a little sponsorship.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's big.</v>

3916
02:53:11.710 --> 02:53:14.440
<v Speaker 6>It's just a dope pellet smoker.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Holy cow.</v>

3917
02:53:14.500 --> 02:53:15.790
<v Speaker 6>It's made in America.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What do you keep?</v>

3918
02:53:15.820 --> 02:53:17.170
<v Speaker 6>What's pellets?</v>
<v Speaker 6>The pellet.</v>

3919
02:53:17.560 --> 02:53:20.500
<v Speaker 6>It works on pellets,</v>
<v Speaker 6>meaning hardwood pellets.</v>

3920
02:53:20.590 --> 02:53:22.000
<v Speaker 6>So what they do is they take,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

3921
02:53:22.001 --> 02:53:25.870
<v Speaker 6>when the lumberyard cuts up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like maple or oak or some hardwood,</v>

3922
02:53:26.110 --> 02:53:29.350
<v Speaker 6>they take the pellets a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they tape rather the saw dust and they</v>

3923
02:53:29.351 --> 02:53:34.351
<v Speaker 6>compress it and the natural sugars</v>
<v Speaker 6>compressed down into pellets.</v>

3924
02:53:35.081 --> 02:53:39.220
<v Speaker 6>And then pelvis hold together and they</v>
<v Speaker 6>pour these pellets in the hopper and the</v>

3925
02:53:39.221 --> 02:53:44.170
<v Speaker 6>hopper feeds into a worm drive that</v>
<v Speaker 6>feeds to a heating element.</v>

3926
02:53:44.350 --> 02:53:47.170
<v Speaker 6>So it's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Keeps it at a very consistent</v>

3927
02:53:47.171 --> 02:53:50.200
<v Speaker 6>temperature heading.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Have you laid it well,</v>

3928
02:53:50.201 --> 02:53:52.270
<v Speaker 6>it lights itself just to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Just to switch.</v>

3929
02:53:52.271 --> 02:53:53.104
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>see it.</v>

3930
02:53:53.180 --> 02:53:55.330
<v Speaker 6>That's what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And if you,</v>

3931
02:53:55.370 --> 02:53:56.120
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>jamie,</v>

3932
02:53:56.120 --> 02:53:59.110
<v Speaker 6>see if he could find like it's dope.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I love these things.</v>

3933
02:53:59.260 --> 02:54:03.460
<v Speaker 6>And there's another company called</v>
<v Speaker 6>trager that just came out with a really</v>

3934
02:54:03.461 --> 02:54:08.290
<v Speaker 6>super high tech one that's thick and</v>
<v Speaker 6>insulated like a yeti cooler.</v>

3935
02:54:08.620 --> 02:54:12.880
<v Speaker 6>It's like they're the best model yet.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And you can control with an app and it</v>

3936
02:54:12.881 --> 02:54:15.430
<v Speaker 6>has digital thermometers that are built</v>
<v Speaker 6>into it.</v>

3937
02:54:15.431 --> 02:54:17.170
<v Speaker 6>So you can tell the temperature,</v>
<v Speaker 6>your food.</v>

<v Speaker 6>What's your,</v>

<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

3973
02:55:43.191 --> 02:55:48.050
<v Speaker 6>IT's just electricity heats up that</v>
<v Speaker 6>heating element and there's a fan that</v>

3974
02:55:48.051 --> 02:55:50.510
<v Speaker 6>blows air on the.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The,</v>

3975
02:55:50.660 --> 02:55:54.620
<v Speaker 6>the wood chips while they're getting</v>
<v Speaker 6>cooked and then it's just smoke smoke</v>

<v Speaker 6>There's another company,</v>

3978
02:55:59.001 --> 02:56:01.190
<v Speaker 6>a really good company called green</v>
<v Speaker 6>mountain grills.</v>

3979
02:56:01.220 --> 02:56:02.990
<v Speaker 6>They actually gave me a grIll back in</v>
<v Speaker 6>the day.</v>

3980
02:56:02.990 --> 02:56:04.280
<v Speaker 6>They were the first ones that ever</v>
<v Speaker 6>tried.</v>

3981
02:56:04.580 --> 02:56:07.940
<v Speaker 6>Those are excellent too,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and you can get a good one that's not.</v>

3982
02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:10.820
<v Speaker 6>Not even too expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Camp chef has another really nice one</v>

3983
02:56:10.821 --> 02:56:11.630
<v Speaker 6>too,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so I was not.</v>

3984
02:56:11.630 --> 02:56:13.430
<v Speaker 6>I'm not trying to tell anybody to buy</v>
<v Speaker 6>anything,</v>

3985
02:56:13.610 --> 02:56:15.740
<v Speaker 6>but I'm saying if you're thinking about</v>
<v Speaker 6>getting a grill,</v>

3986
02:56:15.980 --> 02:56:17.660
<v Speaker 6>I will look into one of these pellet</v>
<v Speaker 6>grill.</v>

3987
02:56:17.661 --> 02:56:18.970
<v Speaker 6>That's pretty bad ass.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well,</v>

3988
02:56:19.010 --> 02:56:22.820
<v Speaker 6>it's super easy to use too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You just pour the pellets into this</v>

3989
02:56:22.821 --> 02:56:26.520
<v Speaker 6>hopper and then you set the temperature.</v>
<v Speaker 6>How often you have to refresh the pellet</v>

3990
02:56:26.580 --> 02:56:27.650
<v Speaker 6>duty.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're so.</v>

3991
02:56:27.890 --> 02:56:31.820
<v Speaker 6>They're so economical like it doesn't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They don't last long because they keep</v>

3992
02:56:31.821 --> 02:56:35.480
<v Speaker 6>the exact right temperature or real</v>
<v Speaker 6>close to it within a few degrees up or</v>

3993
02:56:35.481 --> 02:56:36.960
<v Speaker 6>down.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You uh,</v>

3994
02:56:37.010 --> 02:56:39.590
<v Speaker 6>like the hopper.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I fill it up like every four or five</v>

3995
02:56:39.591 --> 02:56:42.500
<v Speaker 6>cooks.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And if that was like charcoal it would</v>

3996
02:56:42.501 --> 02:56:43.334
<v Speaker 6>last for one.</v>

3997
02:56:43.990 --> 02:56:45.160
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you said that was,</v>

3998
02:56:45.230 --> 02:56:46.640
<v Speaker 6>that's what it looks like.</v>
<v Speaker 6>See those things.</v>

3999
02:56:47.000 --> 02:56:49.400
<v Speaker 6>They look like some sort of a brand</v>
<v Speaker 6>cereal,</v>

4000
02:56:49.430 --> 02:56:50.540
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Doesn't it like one of those?</v>

4001
02:56:50.541 --> 02:56:51.920
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that like terrible food.</v>

4002
02:56:52.070 --> 02:56:56.030
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So what it is is just hardwood sawdust</v>

4003
02:56:56.180 --> 02:56:59.770
<v Speaker 6>and they just smush it and the naturaL</v>
<v Speaker 6>sugar is make it stick together because</v>

4004
02:56:59.780 --> 02:57:02.870
<v Speaker 6>you could break it up with your fingers,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you break it up easy.</v>

4005
02:57:03.320 --> 02:57:05.930
<v Speaker 6>So you pour it into the hopper,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it grinds down,</v>

4006
02:57:05.931 --> 02:57:09.020
<v Speaker 6>see that worm drive below.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It feeds down to that thing on the</v>

4007
02:57:09.021 --> 02:57:10.790
<v Speaker 6>right,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which is like where the heating element</v>

4008
02:57:10.791 --> 02:57:15.791
<v Speaker 6>is and so it just catches fire and then</v>
<v Speaker 6>the flames make smoke and then it fills</v>

4009
02:57:16.311 --> 02:57:18.500
<v Speaker 6>up that chamber and the heat comes from</v>
<v Speaker 6>the smoke.</v>

4010
02:57:18.590 --> 02:57:22.250
<v Speaker 6>So when You put a an elk steak or</v>
<v Speaker 6>something on there,</v>

4011
02:57:22.670 --> 02:57:25.540
<v Speaker 6>can you cook it like in just a couple</v>
<v Speaker 6>minutes or is everything just smoke</v>

4012
02:57:25.590 --> 02:57:25.960
<v Speaker 6>slow?</v>

4013
02:57:25.960 --> 02:57:28.070
<v Speaker 6>It takes a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So like the way I do it now,</v>

4014
02:57:28.130 --> 02:57:30.440
<v Speaker 6>I've done it a bunch of different ways</v>
<v Speaker 6>and all of them are delicious.</v>

4015
02:57:30.441 --> 02:57:33.530
<v Speaker 6>Like elk is my favorite meat.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's delicious healthy meat.</v>

4016
02:57:33.590 --> 02:57:38.590
<v Speaker 6>But my favorite way to do it now because</v>
<v Speaker 6>of this guy Chad whiskey bent barbecue</v>

4017
02:57:40.641 --> 02:57:44.480
<v Speaker 6>on instagram was my friend john dudley's</v>
<v Speaker 6>buddy who's a world champion.</v>

4018
02:57:44.481 --> 02:57:46.310
<v Speaker 6>pitmaster like one of those.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah,</v>

4019
02:57:46.340 --> 02:57:50.660
<v Speaker 6>bad motherfucker grill guys.</v>
<v Speaker 6>James says don't ever cook meat above</v>

4020
02:57:50.661 --> 02:57:53.420
<v Speaker 6>275 degrees.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He says when you're cooking you should</v>

4021
02:57:53.421 --> 02:57:57.020
<v Speaker 6>cook it slowly and don't allow the meat</v>
<v Speaker 6>to dry out and use a meat thermometer.</v>

4022
02:57:57.021 --> 02:58:00.200
<v Speaker 6>So since I started doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've been very happy with the results</v>

4023
02:58:00.470 --> 02:58:04.980
<v Speaker 6>because I get it hundred and 30,</v>
<v Speaker 6>135 degrees somewhere around there.</v>

4024
02:58:05.220 --> 02:58:07.620
<v Speaker 6>Then I pull it and then I reverse sear</v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

4025
02:58:07.950 --> 02:58:09.660
<v Speaker 6>The way I do it is on a frying pan.</v>

4026
02:58:09.660 --> 02:58:12.120
<v Speaker 6>I use butter in the frying pan with</v>
<v Speaker 6>garlic and I see her,</v>

4027
02:58:12.121 --> 02:58:14.520
<v Speaker 6>that shit out of it on each side real</v>
<v Speaker 6>quick.</v>

4028
02:58:14.521 --> 02:58:16.470
<v Speaker 6>Like 30 seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Like you're walking into the house.</v>

4029
02:58:16.620 --> 02:58:17.760
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>breaking into the house.</v>

4030
02:58:17.790 --> 02:58:22.380
<v Speaker 6>Then I get even crazier and I wrap it up</v>
<v Speaker 6>with aluminum foil and I put it in a</v>

4031
02:58:22.381 --> 02:58:25.410
<v Speaker 6>yeti cooler and I seal it up for 15</v>
<v Speaker 6>minutes.</v>

4032
02:58:26.220 --> 02:58:29.730
<v Speaker 6>Let it slowly keep cooking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>cause real slow cooled down.</v>

4033
02:58:29.940 --> 02:58:34.620
<v Speaker 6>And then I opened it up and I let it sit</v>
<v Speaker 6>for another 10 minutes and then I slice</v>

4034
02:58:34.621 --> 02:58:37.470
<v Speaker 6>into that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So what should I do with the gas grill?</v>

4035
02:58:38.550 --> 02:58:40.230
<v Speaker 6>We'll talk,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we'll talk.</v>

4036
02:58:40.290 --> 02:58:42.480
<v Speaker 6>Throw that thing in the fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Give it to homeless people,</v>

4037
02:58:43.600 --> 02:58:46.740
<v Speaker 6>throw it in the la river.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Say this is when you can do something</v>

4038
02:58:46.741 --> 02:58:48.510
<v Speaker 6>like that and you get good at it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

4039
02:58:48.511 --> 02:58:49.680
<v Speaker 6>This is the bread thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's like,</v>

4040
02:58:49.681 --> 02:58:50.514
<v Speaker 6>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you're in.</v>

4041
02:58:50.730 --> 02:58:52.200
<v Speaker 6>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well for me it's a.</v>

4042
02:58:52.380 --> 02:58:53.490
<v Speaker 6>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I love cooking.</v>

4043
02:58:53.760 --> 02:58:57.630
<v Speaker 6>I've always loved cooking and it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's a little bit of a manly thing</v>

4044
02:58:57.631 --> 02:59:01.830
<v Speaker 6>that I like more with cooking,</v>
<v Speaker 6>with lump charcoal over a charcoal grill</v>

4045
02:59:01.880 --> 02:59:05.680
<v Speaker 6>smell and something very manly about the</v>
<v Speaker 6>real fire chemo,</v>

4046
02:59:06.030 --> 02:59:11.030
<v Speaker 6>but honestly as far as taste and as far</v>
<v Speaker 6>as ease of use and repeatability,</v>

4047
02:59:13.170 --> 02:59:16.830
<v Speaker 6>it's hard to fuck with these pellet</v>
<v Speaker 6>grills because you're cooking with real</v>

4048
02:59:16.831 --> 02:59:17.940
<v Speaker 6>wood fire.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

4049
02:59:17.941 --> 02:59:19.740
<v Speaker 6>it smells great.</v>
<v Speaker 6>it tastes great.</v>

4050
02:59:19.741 --> 02:59:24.180
<v Speaker 6>Like when you open the lid up,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the smell of like maple and see the</v>

4051
02:59:24.181 --> 02:59:24.881
<v Speaker 6>different,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 6>kinds of different pellets.</v>

<v Speaker 6>It's called the Daniel Boone.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>

4065
02:59:54.631 --> 02:59:57.720
<v Speaker 6>one thing I took off of your instagram</v>
<v Speaker 6>was the,</v>

4066
02:59:57.721 --> 03:00:00.060
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the eggs and just throwing the kale on</v>

4067
03:00:00.061 --> 03:00:02.310
<v Speaker 6>top of it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh yeah.</v>

4068
03:00:02.640 --> 03:00:03.900
<v Speaker 6>It's a lifesaver.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I mean,</v>

4069
03:00:03.901 --> 03:00:06.840
<v Speaker 6>that's such a simple morning.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh,</v>

4070
03:00:06.841 --> 03:00:07.810
<v Speaker 6>it's the best.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So he's,</v>

4071
03:00:07.860 --> 03:00:12.510
<v Speaker 6>what I do is I take some kale,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I chop it up and then I chop up some</v>

4072
03:00:12.511 --> 03:00:17.511
<v Speaker 6>garlic and usually I do jalapenos too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Then I get some butter cooking.</v>

4073
03:00:17.790 --> 03:00:21.030
<v Speaker 6>I put the kale in the butter,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I saw to it and once it really starts</v>

4074
03:00:21.031 --> 03:00:22.500
<v Speaker 6>getting darker,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's ready to rock.</v>

4075
03:00:22.650 --> 03:00:25.410
<v Speaker 6>I just crack a few eggs and right on top</v>
<v Speaker 6>of it and mix it all up,</v>

4076
03:00:25.710 --> 03:00:27.900
<v Speaker 6>put it on a plate and it's fantastic.</v>

4077
03:00:27.930 --> 03:00:29.940
<v Speaker 6>You mix it up.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They look like they were sunny side up.</v>

4078
03:00:30.110 --> 03:00:33.450
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes I do that too.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes I just put the kale right next</v>

4079
03:00:33.451 --> 03:00:34.260
<v Speaker 6>to the eggs.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

4080
03:00:34.260 --> 03:00:36.690
<v Speaker 6>Sometimes I cook the eggs in the kale.</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

4081
03:00:36.691 --> 03:00:39.060
<v Speaker 6>I've just been throwing the kale on top</v>
<v Speaker 6>of the eggs.</v>

4082
03:00:39.070 --> 03:00:39.900
<v Speaker 6>Great.</v>

<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Super easy.</v>

4086
03:00:43.140 --> 03:00:44.340
<v Speaker 6>The best.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What's this one?</v>

4087
03:00:44.370 --> 03:00:46.350
<v Speaker 6>Have you tried one of these?</v>
<v Speaker 6>I have pretty,</v>

4088
03:00:46.410 --> 03:00:48.060
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>those are great shoes.</v>

4089
03:00:48.970 --> 03:00:51.300
<v Speaker 6>I have a,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think I have that one.</v>

4090
03:00:51.301 --> 03:00:52.830
<v Speaker 6>I have another one like it.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What is the.</v>

4091
03:00:52.831 --> 03:00:56.100
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 6>what you do is you vacuum seal your food</v>

4092
03:00:56.101 --> 03:01:00.220
<v Speaker 6>in a plastic bag and then you put it in</v>
<v Speaker 6>a pot with water and then</v>

4093
03:01:00.220 --> 03:01:02.920
<v Speaker 4>the hot water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the thing will heat up to temperature of</v>

4094
03:01:02.921 --> 03:01:04.860
<v Speaker 4>the water,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like 125 degrees.</v>

4095
03:01:05.350 --> 03:01:10.350
<v Speaker 4>MY question would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is the plastic leaching into your food?</v>

4096
03:01:10.960 --> 03:01:13.210
<v Speaker 4>They say it doesn't and it's a good</v>
<v Speaker 4>question though,</v>

4097
03:01:13.720 --> 03:01:16.900
<v Speaker 4>but how do we.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you can't microwave plastic if</v>

4098
03:01:16.901 --> 03:01:19.510
<v Speaker 4>it's a certain temperature.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe the plastic needs to hit a certain</v>

4099
03:01:20.140 --> 03:01:22.510
<v Speaker 4>temperature to melt.</v>
<v Speaker 4>well they say you should never drink</v>

4100
03:01:22.900 --> 03:01:25.290
<v Speaker 4>bottles that have been in your car in a</v>
<v Speaker 4>hot day in la.</v>

4101
03:01:25.370 --> 03:01:27.090
<v Speaker 4>I was wondering about that reCent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was just like,</v>

4102
03:01:27.100 --> 03:01:28.210
<v Speaker 4>hi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And thinking about that.</v>

4103
03:01:28.660 --> 03:01:31.870
<v Speaker 4>Where did that story like maybe come</v>
<v Speaker 4>from maybe the glass bottled water</v>

4104
03:01:31.871 --> 03:01:33.780
<v Speaker 4>people are putting out false.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Who's good?</v>

4105
03:01:33.790 --> 03:01:35.440
<v Speaker 4>Is there a glass bottle?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Water business,</v>

4106
03:01:35.470 --> 03:01:37.300
<v Speaker 4>yay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And all those are all glass bottles.</v>

4107
03:01:37.301 --> 03:01:40.480
<v Speaker 4>They started off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's the trend on it?</v>

4108
03:01:40.540 --> 03:01:43.280
<v Speaker 4>I think there's actual science behind it</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I was just wondering was all</v>

4109
03:01:43.970 --> 03:01:44.710
<v Speaker 4>conspiracy.</v>

4110
03:01:44.710 --> 03:01:45.880
<v Speaker 4>You were high.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what you're saying.</v>

4111
03:01:47.720 --> 03:01:51.370
<v Speaker 4>The sous vide is good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have actually a blow torch that I do</v>

4112
03:01:51.371 --> 03:01:52.870
<v Speaker 4>with zeus feed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>

4113
03:01:52.871 --> 03:01:55.840
<v Speaker 4>So I do sous vide and then I cook the</v>
<v Speaker 4>outside of it with a torch.</v>

4114
03:01:56.680 --> 03:01:59.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get that brown on the outside.</v>

4115
03:01:59.920 --> 03:02:01.810
<v Speaker 4>I've done that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't prefer it.</v>

4116
03:02:02.470 --> 03:02:05.860
<v Speaker 4>I prefer the trigger style mountain</v>
<v Speaker 4>grill.</v>

4117
03:02:05.861 --> 03:02:08.470
<v Speaker 4>Yoda grill was pellet grills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Again,</v>

4118
03:02:08.471 --> 03:02:10.930
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of different companies.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not trying to endorse one.</v>

4119
03:02:11.200 --> 03:02:14.410
<v Speaker 4>I like green mountain grill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My friend John Dudley loves those</v>

4120
03:02:14.411 --> 03:02:17.350
<v Speaker 4>triggers and then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But that new trigger timberline's pretty</v>

4121
03:02:17.351 --> 03:02:22.351
<v Speaker 4>revolutionary and it's supposed to be</v>
<v Speaker 4>amazing in its ability to insulate.</v>

4122
03:02:22.810 --> 03:02:26.020
<v Speaker 4>Think actually the best one to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's another one called the memphis</v>

4123
03:02:26.050 --> 03:02:27.710
<v Speaker 4>memphis grills.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Supposed to be really good at that.</v>

4124
03:02:27.770 --> 03:02:32.770
<v Speaker 4>Someone told me if you have a glass,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a gas grill to put a cast iron pan on it</v>

4125
03:02:34.270 --> 03:02:35.770
<v Speaker 4>and you do your steak that Way.</v>

4126
03:02:35.860 --> 03:02:36.700
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a good move.</v>

4127
03:02:36.820 --> 03:02:38.140
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To get that,</v>

4128
03:02:38.200 --> 03:02:41.500
<v Speaker 4>that seared flavor from a cast and it's</v>
<v Speaker 4>more even.</v>

4129
03:02:41.501 --> 03:02:44.530
<v Speaker 4>It's gets a little more,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot of big times.</v>

4130
03:02:44.531 --> 03:02:46.570
<v Speaker 4>Take restaurants,</v>
<v Speaker 4>still use cast iron pans,</v>

4131
03:02:46.760 --> 03:02:49.060
<v Speaker 4>cast irons.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pretty bad ass.</v>

4132
03:02:49.090 --> 03:02:50.300
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get iron from it too.</v>

4133

<v Speaker 4>it's good to cook.</v>

4137
03:02:58.451 --> 03:03:01.090

<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

4138
03:03:01.250 --> 03:03:03.250
<v Speaker 4>in an iron pan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get a little bit of iron.</v>

4139
03:03:03.280 --> 03:03:04.270
<v Speaker 4>Oh really?</v>

<v Speaker 4>then starting up again in the fall and</v>

4155
03:03:43.260 --> 03:03:47.890
<v Speaker 4>my specialist,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a streaming on hulu and amazon and I'm</v>

4156
03:03:47.980 --> 03:03:50.140
<v Speaker 4>following my instagram.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you want bread tips,</v>

4157
03:03:50.350 --> 03:03:53.960
<v Speaker 4>how old is your special now?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was about six months ago.</v>

4158
03:03:54.020 --> 03:03:55.660
<v Speaker 4>Five months ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Six months ago?</v>

4159
03:03:56.100 --> 03:03:58.640
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when do you think you'll think about</v>

4160
03:03:58.641 --> 03:04:00.500
<v Speaker 4>doing another one?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What kind of schedule you on?</v>

4161
03:04:00.530 --> 03:04:04.060
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I could start lining it up</v>
<v Speaker 4>because I've got about a.</v>

4162
03:04:04.230 --> 03:04:06.360
<v Speaker 5>I've got about 35,</v>
<v Speaker 5>40.</v>

4163
03:04:06.361 --> 03:04:10.830
<v Speaker 5>That's really solid</v>
<v Speaker 5>fillable stuff.</v>

4164
03:04:10.890 --> 03:04:12.570
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And um,</v>

4165
03:04:12.600 --> 03:04:14.280
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>keep working at that pace by the time I</v>

4166
03:04:14.281 --> 03:04:17.850
<v Speaker 5>set it up and go do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It'll be probably I did it last july is</v>

4167
03:04:17.851 --> 03:04:21.900
<v Speaker 5>when I filmed it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So we're coming up on a year and if I</v>

4168
03:04:21.901 --> 03:04:25.680
<v Speaker 5>did it probably like a year and a half</v>
<v Speaker 5>to two years,</v>

4169
03:04:25.681 --> 03:04:28.080
<v Speaker 5>it feels like two years might be a</v>
<v Speaker 5>little long,</v>

4170
03:04:28.081 --> 03:04:29.790
<v Speaker 5>but it feels like a year and a half will</v>
<v Speaker 5>be.</v>

4171
03:04:30.330 --> 03:04:32.790
<v Speaker 5>It will be ready and I know it was a</v>
<v Speaker 5>clock on it.</v>

4172
03:04:32.791 --> 03:04:36.690
<v Speaker 5>It's really like when is it ready?</v>
<v Speaker 5>But if I'm already at that point,</v>

4173
03:04:36.840 --> 03:04:38.730
<v Speaker 5>I feel like I should crank it out.</v>

4174
03:04:38.940 --> 03:04:40.920
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm on the exact same schedule.</v>

4175
03:04:40.980 --> 03:04:41.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4176
03:04:42.240 --> 03:04:44.640
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people I've talked to have that</v>
<v Speaker 4>Same opinion.</v>

4177
03:04:44.920 --> 03:04:46.560
<v Speaker 4>That seems to be like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a year out,</v>

4178
03:04:46.561 --> 03:04:48.570
<v Speaker 4>a year and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you start feeling this is real.</v>

4179
03:04:48.610 --> 03:04:49.770
<v Speaker 4>It's ready to go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4180
03:04:49.771 --> 03:04:50.710
<v Speaker 4>It takes time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

4181
03:04:50.860 --> 03:04:53.890
<v Speaker 5>You know when you want it to be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't want to just eat.</v>
