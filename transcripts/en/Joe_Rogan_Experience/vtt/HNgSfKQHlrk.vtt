00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches,</v>

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.070
<v Speaker 1>I was lucky enough to fight there in 2004,</v>

3
00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:08.340
<v Speaker 1>2005 and we were pulling 40,000 people every show.</v>

4
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.220
<v Speaker 1>We had a live 40,000 people and that you'd walk out to the arena and then you</v>

5
00:00:14.221 --> 00:00:17.950
<v Speaker 1>check out the stage and sometimes you come up through the floor for your walkout</v>

6
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:18.803
<v Speaker 1>or a kid.</v>

7
00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.640
<v Speaker 1>It was just unbelievable.</v>

8
00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:23.790
<v Speaker 1>They had like some elevator that would make you rise up through the floor.</v>

9
00:00:23.791 --> 00:00:26.940
<v Speaker 1>I remember in the back room once I was trying to find the stairs and I've asked</v>

10
00:00:26.941 --> 00:00:27.241
<v Speaker 1>the lady,</v>

11
00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:27.480
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

12
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.080
<v Speaker 1>where do I go?</v>

13
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.441
<v Speaker 1>And she goes,</v>

14
00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:28.561
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

15
00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:29.394
<v Speaker 1>stand on that thing.</v>

16
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.940
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

17
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:30.751
<v Speaker 1>no way.</v>

18
00:00:30.751 --> 00:00:31.320
<v Speaker 1>And she goes,</v>

19
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.891
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>

20
00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:32.310
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

21
00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:33.143
<v Speaker 1>fuck yes.</v>

22
00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:34.663
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

23
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.050
<v Speaker 1>I remember coming up through the floor and then all of a sudden they're all,</v>

24
00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.960
<v Speaker 1>there's 40,000 people right in front of you.</v>

25
00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:40.320
<v Speaker 1>And it's like,</v>

26
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.080
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

27
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.030
<v Speaker 1>he's amazing.</v>

28
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.590
<v Speaker 1>And then we had a TV audience of 20 million people in Tokyo also.</v>

29
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.330
<v Speaker 1>So it would be a delayed broadcast by about an hour.</v>

30
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.640
<v Speaker 1>So by the time we finished our fight and then on the bus with a TV on the bus</v>

31
00:00:53.641 --> 00:00:57.120
<v Speaker 1>and watch pretty much what you'll find your way back on the way to the hotel.</v>

32
00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.400
<v Speaker 1>But Thailand was pretty cool to Thailand,</v>

33
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.500
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have crowds.</v>

34
00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:03.270
<v Speaker 1>I'm song troy who was fighting for,</v>

35
00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:04.104
<v Speaker 1>he'd have,</v>

36
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.420
<v Speaker 1>he'd make all these money from the TV production,</v>

37
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.310
<v Speaker 1>so he did live shows in the middle of nowhere and people will drive for hours to</v>

38
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.220
<v Speaker 1>be present to,</v>

39
00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.113
<v Speaker 1>for a live event.</v>

40
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.680
<v Speaker 1>And we'd have 40,000,</v>

41
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:15.543
<v Speaker 1>60,000.</v>

42
00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.290
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

43
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.680
<v Speaker 1>there's this one big event once a year called the king's birthday and we get</v>

44
00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:22.170
<v Speaker 1>100,000 people plus every year on the fifth of December.</v>

45
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.800
<v Speaker 1>I was lucky to fight on then four years in a row.</v>

46
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.230
<v Speaker 1>So the first time I went on the ring,</v>

47
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.190
<v Speaker 1>it was the first time that I owe my knees went weak because as far as I could</v>

48
00:01:32.191 --> 00:01:33.360
<v Speaker 1>see was the ocean heads.</v>

49
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.830
<v Speaker 1>And I started trembling.</v>

50
00:01:34.831 --> 00:01:36.930
<v Speaker 1>And then I've come out in the first round.</v>

51
00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:37.440
<v Speaker 1>I've tried this,</v>

52
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.790
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to finish him.</v>

53
00:01:38.791 --> 00:01:41.710
<v Speaker 1>And then by the fifth round I sort of spent my pennies and fell over a couple of</v>

54
00:01:41.711 --> 00:01:44.790
<v Speaker 1>times and then I'm losing them points.</v>

55
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.860
<v Speaker 1>And then the next year I got invited back and I said,</v>

56
00:01:46.861 --> 00:01:47.161
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

57
00:01:47.161 --> 00:01:48.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to get spooked at this time,</v>

58
00:01:48.751 --> 00:01:49.150
<v Speaker 1>this time.</v>

59
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.370
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

60
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.430
<v Speaker 1>like the UFC Gds,</v>

61
00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.450
<v Speaker 1>like you're talking about all the time.</v>

62
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.580
<v Speaker 1>I had the GDS,</v>

63
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.941
<v Speaker 1>the first one,</v>

64
00:01:52.941 --> 00:01:53.550
<v Speaker 1>the second time it's like,</v>

65
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.790
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

66
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.020
<v Speaker 1>I'm not gonna I'm going to this time,</v>

67
00:01:55.021 --> 00:01:56.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to love it and I'm going to absorb it.</v>

68
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.050
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to run with it.</v>

69
00:01:58.051 --> 00:01:58.884
<v Speaker 1>So I've got out there,</v>

70
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.780
<v Speaker 1>big breath in 100,000 people.</v>

71
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.591
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

72
00:02:01.591 --> 00:02:01.801
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

73
00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:03.120
<v Speaker 1>I had the greatest fight of my life.</v>

74
00:02:03.121 --> 00:02:05.130
<v Speaker 1>That was 10 western is verse 10 toys.</v>

75
00:02:05.131 --> 00:02:08.820
<v Speaker 1>And I was the only western of I get getting high fire from ties back the change</v>

76
00:02:08.821 --> 00:02:09.420
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

77
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.620
<v Speaker 1>And then the last time I did it,</v>

78
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:11.250
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

79
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.220
<v Speaker 1>there was probably only 25,000 people a little tiny.</v>

80
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.470
<v Speaker 1>And I was looking at the background.</v>

81
00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.900
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

82
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.290
<v Speaker 1>Geez.</v>

83
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.611
<v Speaker 1>What's going on?</v>

84
00:02:16.611 --> 00:02:17.371
<v Speaker 1>Where is everyone?</v>

85
00:02:17.371 --> 00:02:18.090
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>

86
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.910
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>

87
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:19.743
<v Speaker 1>this is sad.</v>

88
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:21.150
<v Speaker 1>It was nuts.</v>

89
00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.520
<v Speaker 1>But you can tell the difference between $95,000,</v>

90
00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:24.380
<v Speaker 1>$100,000.</v>

91
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.660
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

92
00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:25.010
<v Speaker 1>there was,</v>

93
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.280
<v Speaker 1>there was a little spot near the hot dog stand where you could have another</v>

94
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:29.461
<v Speaker 1>5,000 people.</v>

95
00:02:29.461 --> 00:02:29.910
<v Speaker 1>Easy.</v>

96
00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:30.511
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

97
00:02:30.511 --> 00:02:35.511
<v Speaker 1>I was in an elevator one time with a guy and he recognized me as a comedian and</v>

98
00:02:35.551 --> 00:02:38.890
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to do one of my bits to me,</v>

99
00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.310
<v Speaker 1>but he got it wrong and the bit was just a little bit I used to do about saying</v>

100
00:02:44.311 --> 00:02:45.060
<v Speaker 1>you too,</v>

101
00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.893
<v Speaker 1>at the wrong time,</v>

102
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.350
<v Speaker 1>getting out of a cab at the airport and the driver goes to have a nice flight.</v>

103
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.223
<v Speaker 1>You Go Yuto.</v>

104
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.970
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

105
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:50.803
<v Speaker 1>so that's the bit.</v>

106
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.080
<v Speaker 1>So I'm in the elevator with him,</v>

107
00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.160
<v Speaker 1>this guy.</v>

108
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.760
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

109
00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.001
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

110
00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:54.781
<v Speaker 1>you're a comedian,</v>

111
00:02:54.781 --> 00:02:54.951
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

112
00:02:54.951 --> 00:02:55.171
<v Speaker 1>And said,</v>

113
00:02:55.171 --> 00:02:55.890
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

114
00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:56.071
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

115
00:02:56.071 --> 00:02:56.521
<v Speaker 1>How you doing?</v>

116
00:02:56.521 --> 00:02:56.671
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

117
00:02:56.671 --> 00:02:57.210
<v Speaker 1>when he goes,</v>

118
00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.901
<v Speaker 1>you're the guide,</v>

119
00:02:57.901 --> 00:02:59.680
<v Speaker 1>it says and you all the time.</v>

120
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.400
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not going to call them out on it.</v>

121
00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:04.061
<v Speaker 1>I'm honored.</v>

122
00:03:04.061 --> 00:03:06.570
<v Speaker 1>Even knows who I am so I'm not going to embarrass somebody.</v>

123
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.761
<v Speaker 1>Said,</v>

124
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:06.941
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

125
00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:07.510
<v Speaker 1>that's me,</v>

126
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.170
<v Speaker 1>that's me.</v>

127
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.621
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

128
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:09.011
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

129
00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:09.341
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

130
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:10.510
<v Speaker 1>I do that all the time.</v>

131
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm always saying,</v>

132
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 1>and you at the wrong time,</v>

133
00:03:12.731 --> 00:03:13.240
<v Speaker 1>and now I'm like,</v>

134
00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.451
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

135
00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:13.870
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't,</v>

136
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.180
<v Speaker 1>I should have corrected the guy.</v>

137
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:16.840
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

138
00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:17.231
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

139
00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:18.064
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

140
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.550
<v Speaker 1>there's probably not a day goes by that I don't yell and,</v>

141
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.740
<v Speaker 1>and you and I'm thinking this is getting off the tracks.</v>

142
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.620
<v Speaker 1>So the elevator door opens,</v>

143
00:03:26.621 --> 00:03:30.250
<v Speaker 1>it's in a casino with a bunch of people and we walk off the elevator,</v>

144
00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:31.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm going one way and he goes the other way.</v>

145
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.690
<v Speaker 1>So he starts yelling to me thinking it's gonna be funny what he thinks is my bit</v>

146
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.470
<v Speaker 1>in a casino now with hundreds of people and he's going and you know,</v>

147
00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.540
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

148
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.190
<v Speaker 1>and I'm thinking I'm the only guy here who knows what this guy's talking about</v>

149
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.740
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know what he's talking about.</v>

150
00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:53.323
<v Speaker 1>He</v>

151
00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:55.391
<v Speaker 1>was very,</v>

152
00:03:55.391 --> 00:03:56.224
<v Speaker 1>very straight.</v>

153
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.910
<v Speaker 1>You can run into people man,</v>

154
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.220
<v Speaker 1>and you just use the egg when you should've zagged.</v>

155
00:04:00.221 --> 00:04:03.850
<v Speaker 1>And you run into someone who's completely out of their fucking mind and then</v>

156
00:04:03.851 --> 00:04:05.020
<v Speaker 1>they become a part of your life.</v>

157
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.560
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

158
00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.393
<v Speaker 1>that can happen.</v>

159
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.590
<v Speaker 1>You could definitely run into the wrong people,</v>

160
00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.940
<v Speaker 1>especially if it's a girl,</v>

161
00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.380
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're single.</v>

162
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.921
<v Speaker 1>He just,</v>

163
00:04:11.921 --> 00:04:12.970
<v Speaker 1>for whatever reason,</v>

164
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.800
<v Speaker 1>start talking to someone and it turns out they're fucking crazy and then you,</v>

165
00:04:16.801 --> 00:04:17.634
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

166
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.090
<v Speaker 1>that's a problem with men.</v>

167
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:20.590
<v Speaker 1>Men are willing to.</v>

168
00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.870
<v Speaker 1>We're willing to look past a lot of shit of a chick's hot.</v>

169
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.110
<v Speaker 1>Like I know a lot of guys that have gotten involved with girls that are just</v>

170
00:04:26.111 --> 00:04:27.730
<v Speaker 1>completely out of their fucking mind,</v>

171
00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.860
<v Speaker 1>but they're pretty and they're just like,</v>

172
00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:30.200
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

173
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.030
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

174
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.841
<v Speaker 1>she's a little weird,</v>

175
00:04:31.841 --> 00:04:32.200
<v Speaker 1>but no,</v>

176
00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.570
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

177
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.080
<v Speaker 1>She was a guy who would be running from her.</v>

178
00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.700
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if that was a gal and she beat.</v>

179
00:04:39.701 --> 00:04:42.960
<v Speaker 1>She had giant tits and I'd be running back to answer.</v>

180
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.691
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

181
00:04:43.691 --> 00:04:43.841
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

182
00:04:43.841 --> 00:04:44.411
<v Speaker 1>that's me.</v>

183
00:04:44.411 --> 00:04:45.244
<v Speaker 1>I'm that guy.</v>

184
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.083
<v Speaker 1>Hey</v>

185
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.851
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>

186
00:04:48.851 --> 00:04:49.720
<v Speaker 1>let's do it up.</v>

187
00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:51.510
<v Speaker 1>Take it to a restaurant.</v>

188
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.550
<v Speaker 1>She's yelling out and you and you.</v>

189
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:57.820
<v Speaker 1>And then when she sees your act and then,</v>

190
00:04:57.821 --> 00:04:57.990
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

191
00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.340
<v Speaker 1>like she sees an old recording and she sees that bitch.</v>

192
00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.080
<v Speaker 1>Fuck you.</v>

193
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.960
<v Speaker 1>She didn't even tell me you wouldn't make it an asshole.</v>

194
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:07.450
<v Speaker 1>Fucking selfish.</v>

195
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.460
<v Speaker 1>Bz Brian,</v>

196
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.710
<v Speaker 1>are you doing it like during the wedding vows?</v>

197
00:05:11.711 --> 00:05:12.480
<v Speaker 1>And she says,</v>

198
00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.720
<v Speaker 1>and you and you go,</v>

199
00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:14.020
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

200
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.310
<v Speaker 1>I got to tell you that,</v>

201
00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:18.871
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

202
00:05:18.871 --> 00:05:21.630
<v Speaker 1>when he hosted the espys in 2001,</v>

203
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:26.790
<v Speaker 1>Oj Simpson was just forced to give his heisman trophy back to Fred Goldman</v>

204
00:05:26.791 --> 00:05:28.560
<v Speaker 1>because Oj lost the civil suit,</v>

205
00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.990
<v Speaker 1>so he had to give money reparations back there.</v>

206
00:05:30.991 --> 00:05:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Fred Goldman and Nicole.</v>

207
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:33.391
<v Speaker 1>So he didn't have any money,</v>

208
00:05:33.391 --> 00:05:36.030
<v Speaker 1>so we should take my heisman trophy for whatever that's worth.</v>

209
00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.700
<v Speaker 1>So Fred Goldberg takes it and now he owns it.</v>

210
00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.290
<v Speaker 1>So the next week or the me enormous hosts espys Charles Woodson,</v>

211
00:05:43.291 --> 00:05:44.760
<v Speaker 1>the guy who won the heisman trophy,</v>

212
00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:46.950
<v Speaker 1>the first defensive guy ever sitting in the front row.</v>

213
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:48.091
<v Speaker 1>First joke,</v>

214
00:05:48.091 --> 00:05:48.781
<v Speaker 1>norm tells.</v>

215
00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:50.130
<v Speaker 1>He looks in the front row and he says,</v>

216
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.731
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

217
00:05:50.731 --> 00:05:51.600
<v Speaker 1>Charles Woodson,</v>

218
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.700
<v Speaker 1>and you won the heisman trophy.</v>

219
00:05:53.701 --> 00:05:57.090
<v Speaker 1>No one can ever take that away from your first defensive guy,</v>

220
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.310
<v Speaker 1>win the heisman trophy.</v>

221
00:05:58.311 --> 00:05:59.750
<v Speaker 1>No one can ever take that away from him.</v>

222
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:00.800
<v Speaker 1>And everybody applauds.</v>

223
00:06:00.801 --> 00:06:04.220
<v Speaker 1>It's like a real nice thing and it settles down and one goes,</v>

224
00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:06.590
<v Speaker 1>no one can ever take that heisman trophy away.</v>

225
00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:08.000
<v Speaker 1>And then he pauses and said,</v>

226
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.490
<v Speaker 1>unless of course you kill your wife and a waiter</v>

227
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.780
<v Speaker 1>at bomb hit it really well.</v>

228
00:06:17.781 --> 00:06:18.614
<v Speaker 1>It was a.</v>

229
00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.520
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.190
<v Speaker 1>it was a radio studio and it was Ken Griffey.</v>

231
00:06:22.191 --> 00:06:23.024
<v Speaker 1>Jr was,</v>

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:26.660
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

235
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:29.400
<v Speaker 1>Fucking Mcdonald.</v>

236
00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:30.140
<v Speaker 1>Maybe not task,</v>

237
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.920
<v Speaker 1>but actually it makes me love him even more.</v>

238
00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:34.790
<v Speaker 1>Norm and I talked.</v>

239
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:37.100
<v Speaker 1>We sat next to each other randomly on an airplane,</v>

240
00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.510
<v Speaker 1>talked the whole way back,</v>

241
00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:39.560
<v Speaker 1>just shot the shit,</v>

242
00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:40.520
<v Speaker 1>talking about all kinds of stuff.</v>

243
00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:41.091
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

244
00:06:41.091 --> 00:06:41.391
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

245
00:06:41.391 --> 00:06:42.860
<v Speaker 1>I quit smoking while ago.</v>

246
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.370
<v Speaker 1>Just done with it and for whatever reason the plane lands.</v>

247
00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.880
<v Speaker 1>And he goes,</v>

248
00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:47.151
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

249
00:06:47.151 --> 00:06:48.200
<v Speaker 1>I just want a cigarette.</v>

250
00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.140
<v Speaker 1>And he just walks in this door that you hadn't smoked in like x amount of</v>

251
00:06:51.141 --> 00:06:51.650
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>

252
00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:54.620
<v Speaker 1>But just decided to talking about it on the airplane,</v>

253
00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:55.910
<v Speaker 1>how he quit smoking,</v>

254
00:06:55.970 --> 00:06:56.990
<v Speaker 1>that he just wanted another cigarette.</v>

255
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.710
<v Speaker 1>He went outside and he's just smoking.</v>

256
00:07:00.890 --> 00:07:01.161
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

257

258
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:02.281
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

259
00:07:02.281 --> 00:07:03.051
<v Speaker 1>I thought you quit smoking.</v>

260
00:07:03.051 --> 00:07:03.241
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

261
00:07:03.241 --> 00:07:05.690
<v Speaker 1>I did until just now.</v>

262
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.160
<v Speaker 1>I just wanted a cigarette.</v>

263
00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:08.661
<v Speaker 1>The movie,</v>

264
00:07:08.661 --> 00:07:09.220
<v Speaker 1>me and him,</v>

265
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.750
<v Speaker 1>I did a buddy comedy with him and it got bad reviews,</v>

266
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.330
<v Speaker 1>so the reviewer in my hometown paper said,</v>

267
00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:16.340
<v Speaker 1>Artie Lange has all the charm of a date,</v>

268
00:07:16.341 --> 00:07:17.030
<v Speaker 1>rapists,</v>

269
00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:17.400
<v Speaker 1>fruit,</v>

270
00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.233
<v Speaker 1>true line.</v>

271
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:20.420
<v Speaker 1>So norm looks at it and he calls me up and he goes,</v>

272
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.560
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

273
00:07:21.561 --> 00:07:22.990
<v Speaker 1>that's fucking great.</v>

274
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:25.040
<v Speaker 1>A date.</v>

275
00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:28.020
<v Speaker 1>Rapists has to have way more charm than a regular rapish.</v>

276
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:37.680
<v Speaker 1>Oh God bless.</v>

277
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:38.930
<v Speaker 1>That made me feel better.</v>
