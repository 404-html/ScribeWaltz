The joe rogan experience podcast is brought to you by the flashlight.

2
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.950
If you've got to Joe rogan.net,
click on the link for the fleshlight.

3
00:00:14.951 --> 00:00:19.520
Enter in the code ne Rogan.
You will get 15% off the number one sex toy from me.

4
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.790
That's the sound of,
of opening a flashlight.
That's what it sounds like.

5
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.770
You seen the new ones?
No,
there's new,
there's a new design.
It's,
it's called the,

6
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:31.460
I think the pilot or something and it's really slick.
It looks like,
uh,

7
00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.730
like an Alienware computer of flashlights.
Like it's just designed really cool.

8
00:00:35.731 --> 00:00:37.830
Like really neat form and like,

9
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.980
do you really see what something looks like though,
while you're fucking it?
Well,

10
00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:43.830
if I'm going to have it on my shelf or in my kitchen,
it looks better.

11
00:00:43.831 --> 00:00:46.890
You know what?
It's not a human though.
I mean,
oh no,
I don't care.
Really.

12
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.280
What do you care what it is?
Just the,
you know,
so if somebody sees it,

13
00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:53.640
it looks cooler.
Kind of like why you buy like a,
instead of buying like a,

14
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.050
you know,
a shitty computer like that,
you get $300 at Fry's.
You see like that?

15
00:00:58.051 --> 00:01:01.720
Wow.
Look at that crazy robot computer.
You know?
That's it.
Oh,
I see.
Cool.

16
00:01:01.721 --> 00:01:05.310
Or to look at,
if you have it in your kitchen,
it's just got more nerd cred.
Yeah,

17
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.160
you should look at it.
If I got a flashlight.com you can actually see,

18
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.850
or you go to your website and click on the link and then opens up flashlight and

19
00:01:11.851 --> 00:01:16.140
then the answer in the code name Brogan and get 15% off.
Yay.

20
00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.190
We're also brought to you by [inaudible] dot com see like Megan's of Alpha
brain,

21
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.150
the fight.
Maybe someone was on some Alpha brain when they designed that Shit,

22
00:01:24.151 --> 00:01:26.640
man.
It looks like some sort of a bong.
Yeah,

23
00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.910
don't do not clot on naked girls.
And I was like,
Hey,

24
00:01:29.911 --> 00:01:33.450
here's a tip while you're at work,
did not click on flesh jack.

25
00:01:33.451 --> 00:01:38.451
I accidentally did that and it becomes the most craziest website ever.

26
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.170
It starts showing a bears and a guy's like hugging each other while using

27
00:01:43.171 --> 00:01:46.770
flashlights.
I like,
look at this,
let's try,
uh,
uh,

28
00:01:46.771 --> 00:01:50.220
you just click on this and then next thing you know,
it's just like,
Hey,

29
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.080
look at me looking at my flashlight.
And it's like,
why?

30
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.940
It's like a gay version of,
of the fleshlight,
but it's called Flesh Jack.

31
00:01:56.941 --> 00:01:59.820
It's called the fleshlight flesh Jack Boys.

32
00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.770
And it's just a bunch of guys and fucking flashlights with other guys.

33
00:02:04.771 --> 00:02:07.170
But the guys are kissing and I don't know how I got on this one,

34
00:02:07.171 --> 00:02:08.940
but there's one somewhere in here.

35
00:02:08.941 --> 00:02:13.710
There's too hairy men that look like Bert Kreischer and uh,

36
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.440
and uh,

37
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.670
Thompson girl like hugging each other while using a flashlight on each other.

38
00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.790
It's,
it's really a horrible,
this is hilarious.

39
00:02:20.791 --> 00:02:25.460
It's dudes masturbating into these flashlights.
Yeah.
I wish I could find it.
What?

40
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.180
To look for the hairy bear guys that are sitting on each other's laps.
It's,
it's,

41
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.430
it's a effort,

42
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.420
a man whacking you off with a fucking fleshlight where your Dick

43
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.360
milkshake cup,
that was a field just whacking you the fuck,
Blah.

44
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.690
Go from there.
Thank you.
Flashlight for promoting freaks are us and shit now.

45
00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.570
That's tremendous.
I love it.
Who would like it though?
They would.

46
00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:55.050
Everybody's got their own little kink,
right?
Yeah.
I guess people would like that.

47
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.740
If I was gay and I had wanted my Harry friend to Sipi Jaime and Jack me off

48
00:02:58.741 --> 00:03:00.220
slowly white kissed me in the back

49
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.640
<v 2>of the neck and start licking inside my years wrestling with my hair.</v>

50
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.330
The reason it'll be
asshole up,

51
00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.110
it's often a cop.

52
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.750
I go black off of the cup and be straight and be hanging out with God.
You don't.

53
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.330
All Gay means is that they're sexually attracted to men.

54
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.600
They can do it all kinds of different ways.
Right.

55
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.860
But I leave a little bit like the woman whacking me off.

56
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.920
You want a couple of what I need you for drug,

57
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.130
whatever the fuck that we're currently.

58
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.310
I talked to a gay couple after show once who wanted to correct me and they

59
00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:35.110
wanted to let me know that not everyone who's gay,
uh,
takes in the ass.

60
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:37.960
So I was like,
all right,
so what do you do?

61
00:03:37.961 --> 00:03:40.030
You just blow each other and the guy was like,
yeah,

62
00:03:40.031 --> 00:03:42.320
basically I my why would you care if that,

63
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.340
that distinction is even out there like w w why would you,

64
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.660
why would you even want anyone to know what your bedroom practices are like?

65
00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.900
We know we don't even do that or you don't even do that.
Okay,

66
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.830
why do I need to know this?
You're telling me that people don't,
you know,

67
00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.270
they certainly do.
So can't you make fun of that,
isn't it?
It's not.
Okay.

68
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.110
I think it's open waters for them.
Bagger pirates.

69
00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.470
I don't have nothing against nobody.

70
00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.280
I just don't understand why you got a cup and have a guy come over and whack you

71
00:04:12.281 --> 00:04:15.170
off of it.
I don't get it.
But if that's your,
that's your cane

72
00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.020
by women's feet.
A lot of people like a lot of crazy shit.

73
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.110
Like the craziest combinations of Shit.

74
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.080
There's a lot of fucking Weirdos out there,
man.

75
00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.320
I used to date a chick that used to suck my fucking liberals.
I hate that

76
00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:36.040
fucking nipples.
She wanted to suck in Nichols cause that's how she got off.

77
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.040
I used to did a Korean chick that you would have to come on her face and then

78
00:04:39.041 --> 00:04:42.600
she would have to masturbate for her to come because the Whoa,

79
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.420
the warmth from the fucking just on her face got her all excited.

80
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:47.980
That's the only way you can get her to come.

81
00:04:47.981 --> 00:04:52.450
That's the only way that she was a fucking savage
second,

82
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.550
my nipples.
It's like getting a raft rash.

83
00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.930
Like when he used to do that body surfing thing on those wraps.

84
00:04:56.931 --> 00:05:00.160
So you that salt water and the sandwich start with like scratching your chest

85
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.550
stopping or a kid.
They don't work.
They're dead.

86
00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:05.440
But I have a friend,

87
00:05:05.441 --> 00:05:08.650
my friend Brian Holloway from executive billiards in white plains,

88
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:14.440
love girls playing with his nipple.
He'd talk about it too.
He's a freak.
He Goes,

89
00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.380
God damn,
I get hard as fuck.
It was really funny.
He was a funny dude,
man.

90
00:05:20.381 --> 00:05:24.400
He was like one of those guys that you hang around with at the pool who always

91
00:05:24.401 --> 00:05:26.410
made everybody.
He was way funnier than me like he was.

92
00:05:26.411 --> 00:05:29.680
He was always saying funny shit there.
What a fucking character.

93
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.670
We always talk about his nipples.
Man,
girl,
you can't touch my nickels man.
Damn.

94
00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.760
I think once a girl,
but it's different.
You know,

95
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.950
I think once a girl is with a guy that likes that you,
it's like Gosh,

96
00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:41.200
we think anyway,
life's that.

97
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.930
So they try that shouldn't have first you're like second my fucking,

98
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.150
what the fuck is wrong with you?

99
00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:51.070
I'm trying to crack a nut and you're bringing me back fucking childhood

100
00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:58.010
do to do on at.com o n n I t makers of Alpha brain,

101
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.670
uh,
which is a cognitive enhancing supplement.

102
00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.000
The all the information if you have any questions because it's very,

103
00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:09.950
very detailed on,
on at.com.
What's funny,
I got to this point,
I've fleshed,

104
00:06:09.951 --> 00:06:13.820
checked out,
calm worry.
These two,
these two pilots like,

105
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:16.490
like it's like a storyline thing where they just take off their clothes and

106
00:06:16.491 --> 00:06:17.750
they're like,
hey,
we're piloting now.

107
00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.020
We're like working out together with our flashlights naked.

108
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.750
You want to masturbate together?
Air Hangar,
Brian,
I don't think

109
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.340
I would not be as confident in my sexuality as it follows you.

110
00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:33.180
I just think it'd be a traveler to watch those.

111
00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:35.010
I think it's so funny to watch it.

112
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.570
I'm not going to sit there and watch it alone in a house and have to have other

113
00:06:38.571 --> 00:06:40.330
people in the room.
So it's more of a joke.
But

114
00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.140
that is a true thing.
You don't want to be what I mean it's all context.
You know?

115
00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:52.100
If you're looking at something and going,
wow,
that's so fucking hot or you know,

116
00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.710
I mean you could look at murders and be like,
well,
I mean you have to.

117
00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:56.630
If you're watching something really fucked up,

118
00:06:56.631 --> 00:06:59.450
it should really be in the preference for a lot of other people so you can

119
00:06:59.451 --> 00:07:02.450
evaluate it together.
Yeah.
That's just shocking shit.

120
00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.020
Watching something fucked up when you're alone and you have to think about it

121
00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.300
and you get scared and shit and you have to it close.
At least two pictures,

122
00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.940
a bunch of you together.
You're like,
we're all together.
We're okay.

123
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:15.410
Let's make fun of this real quick.

124
00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:19.510
I don't like watching creepy shit,
but I don't know.

125
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:23.330
I'll fucking sleep with the light on and shit I don't like.

126
00:07:23.331 --> 00:07:26.000
None of that stuff at night.
Like the,
I like the exercise was,

127
00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:29.750
and I was just scrolling.
It was like one 15 I think it was Friday night.

128
00:07:29.751 --> 00:07:32.650
Fuck you.
Fuck you.
That's the only,
watch the exorcism.

129
00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:36.860
That daytime bitch with a lighter with the fucking day light on.

130
00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:41.060
That was at the time.
Devil.
I'm come out in the daylight though.
At the time.

131
00:07:41.061 --> 00:07:44.510
That was a fucking monster of a moving man.
Whew.
That was a scary movie.

132
00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:49.750
There's some scary fucking movies they'd get to this commercial on a.com Alpha

133
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.300
brain killing me.
You guys know what it is?
Listen,
it's all,

134
00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:57.190
they're all new tropics.
I've,
I've said this 100,000 times in the podcast.

135
00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:01.480
I try not to almost 200 times actually we're,
we're about our 200th episode.

136
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.010
We're separating at the icehouse Wednesday.
Yeah,

137
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.700
so we'll talk about that on the podcast as well.
Jesus Christ,
Alpha brain,

138
00:08:07.701 --> 00:08:10.820

141

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:41.150
I've been taking you neutral bics and vitamins and supplements for years and

148
00:08:41.151 --> 00:08:43.970
years and they make a,
they make a big difference,
I think.

149
00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.710
I think it's really important to eat healthy,

150
00:08:45.711 --> 00:08:49.160
but I think it's also really important to,
uh,
to take supplements.

151
00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.330
I think they've had a tremendous impact on me.
I could feel it.

152
00:08:53.490 --> 00:08:56.100
And especially when you train hard,
if do a lot of work,
you know,

182
00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:49.780
The improv.

183
00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:54.720
Coconut Grove is all different now.

184
00:10:57.150 --> 00:11:01.230
Now it's very quiet and whole ball doesn't have no more wet Willie's they have

185
00:11:01.231 --> 00:11:02.810
like no more what

186
00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:08.250
I'm staying at the Sonesta hotel,
which is different,
you know,

187
00:11:08.251 --> 00:11:11.930
they have like cocoa walked,
we still got howl at the moon,
you know,

188
00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:15.900
for people who were coked up and want to go in and sing songs and they,
you know,

189
00:11:15.901 --> 00:11:17.940
they changed it around.
So it's a different vibe.

190
00:11:17.941 --> 00:11:19.830
I'm excited about going down there,
you know what I'm saying?

191
00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.650
What was the last time you were there?
Three,
four years ago.

192
00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:25.410
Three years ago in September or something.
The thing with me.

193
00:11:25.411 --> 00:11:29.150
It was even more than that.
Yeah,
you just go to Fort Lauderdale.
Crazy,

194
00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:34.540
crazy where the wild is crowd I've ever performed in front of like consistently.

195
00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:39.180
It was like doing comedy in another country.

196
00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:43.710
It was doing comedy in the country that just had totally different rules because

197
00:11:43.711 --> 00:11:44.650
everywhere else,
man,

198
00:11:44.651 --> 00:11:48.600
no people didn't talk while shows are going on that fucking Miami Improv man.

199
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.590
They would just just talk while the entire show was going on,
you know,

200
00:11:52.591 --> 00:11:54.970
just have conversations with each other.
I remember there was,

201
00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.120
I said something about Oscar de la Hoya and someone,
someone on audience goes,

202
00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:04.120
fuck you man.
Fernando Varguez and then the guy is a man for both of them,
man.

203
00:12:04.121 --> 00:12:04.480
Who else?

204
00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:09.250
Cesar job and then they start arguing Dirac for doing the show about who is like

205
00:12:09.251 --> 00:12:12.760
the better boxer who was like the best box forever.

206
00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:16.000
Like you fucking morons.
Like what are you doing?

207
00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:18.550
You have no control over yourself.
You don't even,

208
00:12:18.551 --> 00:12:20.440
you don't even think it for a second and a show is on.

209
00:12:20.441 --> 00:12:22.060
It wasn't even on their mind,
man.

210
00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:27.090
There was like instant passion toxo plasma infestation running rapid through

211
00:12:27.161 --> 00:12:32.140
their brain.
They're jumping up and you know,
calling out Felix Trinidad,

212
00:12:33.250 --> 00:12:37.140
you know,
it's fucking crazy.
I remember the one night we went,

213
00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.580
we were together in a fight,
almost broke out.
Oh yeah.

214
00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:42.400
With the check and the husband and the chick one and it gets spanked and the

215
00:12:42.401 --> 00:12:46.780
husband got mad.
Something to a crazy fact that was going to go out on stage.

216
00:12:46.781 --> 00:12:49.930
And I don't remember when I became friends with the husband and her husband

217
00:12:49.931 --> 00:12:51.620
bought his drinks and that was the end of the day.

218
00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:54.370
There was so much craziness comes in a have place.
I was there that night,

219
00:12:54.371 --> 00:12:58.780
the kid quick.
What's the kid from Boston?
Real Nice.
Sweet guy.
Comic.

220
00:12:58.781 --> 00:13:02.290
He was in big,
uh,
he used to close with we are the world.

221
00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:07.150
Oh Kevin [inaudible].
Kevin Meeney that was there and I,
where he quit.
It was,
no,

222
00:13:07.151 --> 00:13:09.700
no.
You know what happened to Kevin Meeney,
right?
What?
Kevin,

223
00:13:09.701 --> 00:13:11.480
me and he came out of the Queen Gay.
Yeah.

224
00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:15.700
And Greg Fitzsimmons is like really good friends with them.
Good guy.
He says,

225
00:13:15.701 --> 00:13:19.510
all of a sudden the guy's creative.
All of a sudden he's write new material.

226
00:13:19.511 --> 00:13:23.020
He lost a bunch of weight.
Feels great.
It's an amazing,

227
00:13:23.021 --> 00:13:26.770
I was living with a burden bro.
And you know what,
we all kind of fucking knew.

228
00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:28.420
He ain't talked to him,
you know,

229
00:13:28.421 --> 00:13:31.540
and he's really never had a conversation with the guy.

230
00:13:31.541 --> 00:13:36.490
But I remember at one point in time,
man,
he was,
you're really fucking fun.

231
00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:40.090
Yes.
He fell.
He fell off for a while and I don't know why,

232
00:13:40.091 --> 00:13:43.420
but I guess that was it.
It was the burden of being in the closet.

233
00:13:43.421 --> 00:13:47.830
But I went to see him with a friend of mine,
uh,

234
00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:53.200
when we were like maybe 19,
19 or 20 at the most.

235
00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:57.060
I hadn't even done standup yet.
It hadn't started to stand up yet.
And,
uh,

236
00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:02.070
it was at catch a rising star and Cambridge and he fucking destroyed Troy.

237
00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.450
We are big pants.
Pete Paul,

238
00:14:04.451 --> 00:14:09.010
he had this thing about big pants and about his family being big pants people.

239
00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:12.370
It was early.
Don't even know why you couldn't,

240
00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:15.700
I couldn't write it down for you on paper.
Why was so funny?

241
00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:19.410
The early nineties yes.
He was very fun.
No,

242
00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:24.340
it was actually before that because I started standing up in 88 so it was before

243
00:14:24.341 --> 00:14:29.080
I started stand up,
so it was probably like 86 I seen him.
He was on fire.

244
00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:30.700
Oh my God.
I'm telling you man.

245
00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:34.660
Kevin Meaney at one point in time had a magic,

246
00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:37.120
he was just one of those guys who can just go on stage,

247
00:14:37.121 --> 00:14:40.780
just start talking about shit.
And it was just funny.
It was just funny.

248
00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:43.320
He just had,
there's a lot of dudes like,

249
00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:48.100
you know how Brody Stevens got that thing where he hits that weird groove and he

250
00:14:48.101 --> 00:14:52.160
could just talk about anything and it doesn't make any sense.
Salt to

251
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.030
<v 3>the left,
sir.
You know,
he can say something like that.
He just 11 man,</v>

252
00:14:56.060 --> 00:15:00.110
he's going to be a con in tomorrow by the way.
Oh,
powerful.
Brody Stevens.
Yeah.

253
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:01.040
That's awesome.

254
00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:05.620
It's amazing what kind of burden them was be living with any secret like that.

255
00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:10.630
I had a friend that I knew for years and he should show it up with girls and

256
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:15.200
he'd drink and,
but then he drink and he'd just disappear for three months.

257
00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:18.660
And it was that thing he was,
he really was.

258
00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:22.460
Somebody told me they seen him up with an a park with no shirt on with another

259
00:15:22.461 --> 00:15:25.220
guy.
And I was like,
I don't give a fuck and a park.
Yeah.

260
00:15:25.221 --> 00:15:27.950
Like I don't really like hiking,
hiking,
you know,
like Runyon Canyon,
you know,

261
00:15:27.951 --> 00:15:30.560
like one of those things.
And I was like,
come on.
I never,

262
00:15:30.561 --> 00:15:33.500
and I asked him and he goes,
yeah.
He goes,
that's what's killing me.
I don't know.

263
00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:38.450
Highlight and what was crazy,
I met her mother said,
man,
movie.
Really?

264
00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.720
Yeah.
So you follow me here?

265
00:15:41.721 --> 00:15:44.470
These guys go fuck those gate cock suckers and all.

266
00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:47.720
He's in the middle of all this.
So I could imagine,

267
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:52.780
I never knew that he was gay till a year or two after we did the fucking movie.

268
00:15:53.310 --> 00:15:56.930
If I
could just imagine how bad,

269
00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:58.730
I'm sure I said some dumb shit.

270
00:15:58.860 --> 00:15:59.011
<v 4>Well,</v>

271
00:15:59.011 --> 00:16:03.960
I think we've all known a few guys that have struggled with that.

272
00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:06.180
You know,
there's what,
I don't want to say the guy's name,

273
00:16:06.181 --> 00:16:09.330
but there's that one guy who's a real good comic,

274
00:16:09.331 --> 00:16:13.530
but he drinks a lot because he's gay.
He doesn't,
doesn't,
he's not out about it,

275
00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:17.780
you know,
because he's like every single comic.
I know.

276
00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:21.900
He's like,
yeah,
I can't get any.
I'm sorry.

277
00:16:21.901 --> 00:16:25.880
I can't get into specifics as she shouldn't even brought it up.
We have,
uh,
I've,

278
00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:29.610
I've known guys personally and watched them struggle with that.
It's sad.

279
00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:32.820
It's got a fucking suck man.
And it's all just because of intolerance.

280
00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:34.920
Who gives a fuck if someone's gay?

281
00:16:35.070 --> 00:16:39.000
As long as I can trust you to not fuck me when I'm drunk.
Okay.
I don't care.

282
00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:41.400
You know,
I don't care if someone's gay.
Never Jeff,

283
00:16:41.401 --> 00:16:45.390
Jeff Richards from the comic store or your piano,
piano plan.
Dude,

284
00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:49.040
that Guy Jeff Richards,
I call him Jeff.
Richard,
Jeff,
Jeff,

285
00:16:50.850 --> 00:16:52.050
Jeff Bridges is the committee,

286
00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:55.970
<v 3>the comedian from Saturday night live.
The other guys that he would do pee her.</v>

287
00:16:56.010 --> 00:16:59.890
Why can't I find his last name?
Jeff Scott.
Jeff Scott,
Jeff Scott,

288
00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:00.920
my biology sledding.

289
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:03.770
<v 4>I hate that I have too many numbers.</v>

290
00:17:03.771 --> 00:17:06.590
It's called Dunbar's syndrome or something like that.

291
00:17:06.591 --> 00:17:10.630
And you can only store like 150 fucking names and faces in your head.

292
00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.790
Something along those lines.
But uh,
yeah,

293
00:17:13.791 --> 00:17:18.590
I mean that guy was like openly gay and the coolest kind of hang out with and

294
00:17:18.591 --> 00:17:23.180
I'm like,
what one of us?
You know,
he was great.
He,
I mean,
who would care?

295
00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:27.800
That's what he's into.
He would joke around about it.
It'd be fun.
Who would care?

296
00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:28.730
I mean,

297
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:32.540
the only reason why you would care is because you're trying to control something

298
00:17:32.541 --> 00:17:36.170
that's going on inside of you or you've got some weird,

299
00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:40.040
ridiculous notions that are,
you know,

300
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:43.640
some religious notions about what another person should and shouldn't do.

301
00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:47.720
Other than that,
why do you,
why would you give a fuck?
Like what is that?
Well,
why,

302
00:17:47.721 --> 00:17:49.350
why do people trip out about that?

303
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:53.790
<v 3>Because they do pro,
they just do,
you know,
I grew up around it.</v>

304
00:17:53.791 --> 00:17:56.700
My mother had a bar plus she was a half a fag hag.

305
00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:02.010
[inaudible] mother was having a fag hag cause she had the bar,
you know,

306
00:18:03.450 --> 00:18:06.150
and I grew up with it and there was one particular guy that died.

307
00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:07.650
He used to always tease me when I was a kid.

308
00:18:07.651 --> 00:18:10.100
I'm gonna fucking tie you up and then we'll go mommy wave.

309
00:18:10.101 --> 00:18:13.800
And he would just tease me,
you know,
but I never really,
uh,

310
00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:17.670
I tell you where I really learned a lot about the whole gay society.

311
00:18:17.671 --> 00:18:21.870
It was when I got locked up because they had an aids unit and this prison that's

312
00:18:21.871 --> 00:18:24.390
an aid started to get big and they didn't know how to handle them.

313
00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:27.990
And what year was this?
This is 87.
I was very fortunate and he,

314
00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:31.230
they had these barracks that you lived in,
but the aids unit,

315
00:18:31.260 --> 00:18:32.610
you could eat off the fucking floor.

316
00:18:33.090 --> 00:18:36.840
And they had us big TV and they had refrigerators.
So people were like,

317
00:18:36.841 --> 00:18:38.160
we don't talk to those mother fuckers.

318
00:18:38.161 --> 00:18:41.220
But there was a couple of guys that said dog,
they go around and play cards.

319
00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:42.390
They could go down there.

320
00:18:42.750 --> 00:18:44.970
So I'd start going down and I ran my action out of there.

321
00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:47.310
Most of the time my gambling because they had a TV,

322
00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:51.240
a big color TV and they've got to talk to them and asked them how they got the

323
00:18:51.241 --> 00:18:55.260
age.
You know,
some people like,
I don't know how I got it.
You know,
stop it.

324
00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:58.410
You know exactly how the fuck you got to.
You even narrow it down to the night.

325
00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:01.980
Cause once they read you that ride,
you know exactly what night you got it.

326
00:19:02.250 --> 00:19:05.370
And half of these guys were junkers.
There was only five or six in the unit.

327
00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:09.790
There was two guys that got it from sex and the other five got it from junk.

328
00:19:09.790 --> 00:19:13.230
And you know those syringes,
that bloodshed is horrible.

329
00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:18.240
Simply horrible.
And you know,
you talk about,
it's like us right now.
We're like,

330
00:19:18.241 --> 00:19:21.310
yeah,
we go out,
we meet a girl and we tell him to put on a coat.

331
00:19:21.311 --> 00:19:23.370
We put a condom on and shit.
They could,

332
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:26.640
that's just like fucking without a condom and fucking 20 chicks at night without

333
00:19:26.641 --> 00:19:27.390
a condom.

334
00:19:27.390 --> 00:19:31.050
Sharing your one needle with somebody on the street corner and he'd come up to

335
00:19:31.051 --> 00:19:34.350
you going,
you got $3.
Yeah,
I got to,
let's buy a bag of shit,
a fucking

336
00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:39.810
shit.
A fucking race shit out with beer.
You know what I'm saying?

337
00:19:39.811 --> 00:19:42.470
Like they put beer in it and squirt it out or whatever.
I'm really,

338
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:46.510
I don't know Joe.
I don't know.
Don't worry.
It's just making it.
I know.
I mean,

339
00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:49.590
I don't think if you're buying heroin on the street with a Syringe,

340
00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:52.400
I don't think you go on a ride eight to buy fucking pharmacy.

341
00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:55.110
Probably don't even know by an alcohol.
Yeah.
You know?

342
00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.930
So all those people in the 70s didn't really know.
I mean,

343
00:19:57.931 --> 00:19:59.940
if they do a real statistic count,

344
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:04.260
how many people just got very thick and they had the pneumonia.
I had HIV.

345
00:20:04.261 --> 00:20:07.470
You know,
it's like they found out years later that,
uh,
what's that shit?

346
00:20:07.471 --> 00:20:10.260
When you get abscesses in your mouth that they kill you?

347
00:20:10.261 --> 00:20:13.410
And they went back in time whenever they had skulls and you could see the

348
00:20:13.411 --> 00:20:16.920
abscesses have grown and they realize now with today's medicine,

349
00:20:16.921 --> 00:20:19.710
they will have saved these people.
You know?
You don't know that shit.

350
00:20:19.711 --> 00:20:20.910
We don't fucking know.
So,

351
00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:26.760
but just a burden to living with something like the burden I had even with just

352
00:20:26.761 --> 00:20:29.760
somebody trying to hide an addiction,
that's a burden.

353
00:20:30.590 --> 00:20:35.040
Burden is me being gay or they're not wanting somebody to know when we being a

354
00:20:35.041 --> 00:20:38.850
fief at night or me being the ice man and killing people and coming up with my

355
00:20:38.851 --> 00:20:43.530
family,
the daytime,
those burdens after weight dramatically on you.

356
00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:47.440
They weren't your mad cause they go into deep into your psyche.
It's a secret.

357
00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:50.890
<v 2>So it somewhere along the line if it affects you,</v>

358
00:20:50.891 --> 00:20:54.250
there has to affect the other parts of your life and eventually you're going to

359
00:20:54.251 --> 00:20:58.870
blow cause youtube borrow from Peter to pay mobile are Paul emotionally,

360
00:20:58.871 --> 00:21:02.970
which is the fucking worst when you're playing with your emotions,
right?
Yeah.

361
00:21:02.971 --> 00:21:03.310
And you know,

362
00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:06.990
and when you're constantly spending energy trying to trick yourself and

363
00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.790
everything is all right.
That's like you don't,

364
00:21:09.791 --> 00:21:13.750
you don't even have half your brand because it's like your whole brain is in

365
00:21:13.751 --> 00:21:14.560
conflict.

366
00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:19.060
Like give you like the rest of the thinking of planning and looking objectively

367
00:21:19.061 --> 00:21:19.721
at your future.

368
00:21:19.721 --> 00:21:23.740
That doesn't even take place because all you're doing is dealing with whatever's

369
00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:26.650
fuck one.
Yeah,
whatever.
Whatever weird issue it is.

370
00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:30.580
Humans are so strange,
man.

371
00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:34.960
It's so strange how we lock onto behavior patterns like that.
Like you'll,

372
00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:36.940
you'll see people,
they'll get addicted to gambling.

373
00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.100
I mean that's a simple behavior pattern.

374
00:21:39.101 --> 00:21:42.700
Some something happened along the line and their mind,

375
00:21:42.701 --> 00:21:47.701
their reward system got completely addicted to these giant jolts that they get

376
00:21:48.101 --> 00:21:51.040
from risking money.
And when they don't have that,

377
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:55.030
they don't feel alive when they do a regular job and sit there with what,

378
00:21:55.031 --> 00:21:55.211
you know,

379
00:21:55.211 --> 00:21:58.600
what they would call squares and just sit around all day with a bunch of fucking

380
00:21:58.601 --> 00:21:59.650
people that just,
you know,

381
00:21:59.770 --> 00:22:04.060
don't want to take any chances and get put 15% on every tip.
You know,
they,

382
00:22:04.061 --> 00:22:06.610
they want to fucking roll dice.
They want to see what happens.

383
00:22:06.611 --> 00:22:10.660
They want to give it a chance and they get suckered in and then it consumes
them.

384
00:22:10.690 --> 00:22:15.130
I've seen guys,
I've seen guys become homeless gambling junkie.
I've seen it.

385
00:22:15.131 --> 00:22:18.700
I've actually seen them.
The hoarder.
You used to have an apartment.
Yeah.
That guy.

386
00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:22.300
Yeah.
But,
uh,
guys from the pool hall,
from back in the in white plains.

387
00:22:22.301 --> 00:22:25.060
I saw a couple of guys go homeless.
There was a,

388
00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:29.410
there was a lot of older dudes especially that would like in their sixties and

389
00:22:29.410 --> 00:22:31.630
seventies come in yelling about a fucking horse.

390
00:22:31.660 --> 00:22:35.740
That's motherfucker comment five taking it on the yelling the numbers out for

391
00:22:35.741 --> 00:22:40.030
the lottery.
I got five,
six to seven the motherfucking five [inaudible]

392
00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.270
all the things I've read it,

393
00:22:43.271 --> 00:22:46.530
all the shows I've seen about gambling because it's always fucking,

394
00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:50.950
because my mother was hooked so I was successful.
I was successful to that.

395
00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:55.250
Susceptible to that disease.
I didn't say I was 18 you know,

396
00:22:57.250 --> 00:23:01.090
deep down inside these people want to lose adaptable.
These people want to lose.

397
00:23:01.091 --> 00:23:04.270
Yes.
That's why they,
I mean nobody ever says to,
I just got a ticket.

398
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:06.670
I just got fucking pulled over.
Fucked in the ass.

399
00:23:06.910 --> 00:23:09.400
These people come in and sit there and drink and going,
what's up dog?

400
00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:13.850
Those fucking Boston Celtic motherfuckers.
They didn't cover the spread.

401
00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:17.770
They'll tell you that whole night and how they're down 12 how Camara and you're

402
00:23:17.771 --> 00:23:21.730
looking at him like,
oh my God.
And I almost got hooked on gambling.
Joe,

403
00:23:21.731 --> 00:23:26.620
when I was 18 I was close and I figured out that this was the cocaine logic.

404
00:23:26.621 --> 00:23:30.330
I figured out that I had two vices.
I like to gamble and I like to snort.

405
00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:35.320
I had to pick one,
pick the other.
There's nothing with code pushed.

406
00:23:35.321 --> 00:23:38.470
The Gail who got to your life comes like this can really get into this is good

407
00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:42.160
because one thing I was,
you know when you were evicted,

408
00:23:42.161 --> 00:23:46.010
you're weak and you're vulnerable to money and the quick score,
but I also knew

409
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:49.220
<v 3>there was another side to that coin and the coin was that you have to pay</v>

410
00:23:49.221 --> 00:23:53.880
somebody.
If you lose an 85% of the time,
you lose.
And let me tell you something,

411
00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.420
if I'm going to give somebody 600 hours,
listen,

412
00:23:56.450 --> 00:24:00.200
if I'm selling blow and I'm mugging people and I'm making four or five grand a

413
00:24:00.201 --> 00:24:03.230
week,
I don't mind giving you a grade.
That's a cost of doing business.

414
00:24:03.231 --> 00:24:05.150
You know what I'm saying?
Your app there,
you're talking shit,

415
00:24:05.390 --> 00:24:10.280
I got some Sandvik conversation,
but if I'm earning a living,

416
00:24:10.281 --> 00:24:12.170
like I got to get up and go to work.
Guys had been,

417
00:24:12.171 --> 00:24:15.470
I got to give my money or some idiot because I bet the fucking Nixon,

418
00:24:15.471 --> 00:24:18.350
they want to play fucking jungle handball and I'm not going to cover this

419
00:24:18.351 --> 00:24:20.960
fucking spread here.
Forget it.
So I said,
if I'm going to take,

420
00:24:20.990 --> 00:24:25.000
if I'm going to get wasted $200 on gambling,
I might as well spend two alarms.

421
00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:27.350
I snot and,
and look out a window and get something out of it.

422
00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:30.200
At least I'm paranoid.
You know what I'm saying?
I get something out of it.

423
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:33.470
You know a assurance is like gambling.
When you buy insurance,

424
00:24:33.471 --> 00:24:35.990
they don't give you nothing.
You signed a paper.

425
00:24:35.991 --> 00:24:39.560
That's why insurance is the hardest sale on the fucking world.
You get a history.

426
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:43.280
It's like gambling.
When you lose,
we getting,
it's the same fucking logic.

427
00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:47.420
Like it's nothing.
There's nothing.
It's just a transfer of paper.

428
00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:50.930
What is gambling at the end?
When you gamble on something,
it's not,

429
00:24:50.931 --> 00:24:54.180
you could gamble on yourself that go fight Jon Jones,
which I guy,

430
00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:58.250
I could get on the fucking horse myself.
It's the same kind of logic,
Joe Rogan.

431
00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:02.990
We get nothing for it just to transfer a fucking money and it always ends up.

432
00:25:02.991 --> 00:25:06.170
You've given up that fucking cash.
It never comes the other way.

433
00:25:06.171 --> 00:25:07.580
Every once in a great while he's there.

434
00:25:07.581 --> 00:25:11.080
Anybody that's like a really good gambler that's out there making a living

435
00:25:11.090 --> 00:25:13.170
gambling.
Yes,
but their,

436
00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:17.600
their iqs have to be fucking phenomenal and they'll inch roll and they have to

437
00:25:17.601 --> 00:25:20.290
have the control of an older gentlemen.
You have to,

438
00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:25.070
you have to know this is a seem the God damn,
what did I give you?

439
00:25:25.071 --> 00:25:26.390
80 grand on a Friday night.

440
00:25:26.391 --> 00:25:29.630
You're going to Vegas and you're going to fucking Kadesh and in the ass you're

441
00:25:29.631 --> 00:25:31.250
going to send every fucking dime of it.

442
00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:34.100
But a controlled gambler is somebody who says,
you know what,

443
00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:36.740
just because there's a game on Tuesday,
don't mean I got a gamble.

444
00:25:36.741 --> 00:25:39.580
I'm saving my money for Thursday.
In fact,
I'm going to call it.

445
00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:43.610
They out with the book.
They call it the book and fuck with the book.
Hey,

446
00:25:43.611 --> 00:25:45.500
it's Tuesday,
but what's the line on Thursday?

447
00:25:45.501 --> 00:25:47.500
And they start fucking with the books and started calling.

448
00:25:47.690 --> 00:25:51.800
It's a system of Joe and the people who make money.
It's like anything else,

449
00:25:51.801 --> 00:25:55.010
Joe Rogan,
this comics like man,
don't have millions.
You know what I'm saying?

450
00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.650
And then there's comics that figured out how to become a a,

451
00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:01.910
a label and a and a business at.
The same thing happens with gambling.

452
00:26:01.911 --> 00:26:04.520
This people would just come and go through gambling and when they go,

453
00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:07.370
they lose a house.
You know,
they lose a house.

454
00:26:07.371 --> 00:26:11.990
A wife can cause a job because of the affects everything.
But with fucking,
yeah,

455
00:26:11.991 --> 00:26:15.950
I mean it ain't had my friend Jimmy Burke on and story.
If his childhood,

456
00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.650
his dad would just go off,
go off,

457
00:26:18.890 --> 00:26:22.030
just go off and go money and lose the house and that would be it.
No,

458
00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:26.010
the biggest gambling loser was of our time.
John Gotti,

459
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:30.290
a million a month,
the cash,
250,000 on a weekend.

460
00:26:30.291 --> 00:26:33.450
He was making 12 million a fucking year shoe.

461
00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:37.190
Once in a while.
The feds got documents.

462
00:26:37.191 --> 00:26:41.410
They were thinking of putting the thing on the biggest loser ever.
Sports wise.

463
00:26:41.910 --> 00:26:44.010
It did generate most

464
00:26:44.010 --> 00:26:44.790
<v 2>of it.</v>

465
00:26:44.790 --> 00:26:49.290
I'll look at a guy like that go that motherfucker dressed in $2,000 suits when

466
00:26:49.291 --> 00:26:52.260
he was just walking the streets.
Yeah.
How much was he really stealing?

467
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:57.710
He was stealing because he was a degenerate gambler from the fucking cards to

468
00:26:58.411 --> 00:27:02.250
fucking dice,
to fucking sports,
to everything,

469
00:27:02.730 --> 00:27:06.660
and he would lie.
You know what I'm saying?
Like he lie about his losses.

470
00:27:06.661 --> 00:27:10.680
He got him and go,
I need 300,000 to put money out in the street.
No,

471
00:27:10.681 --> 00:27:12.900
he was losing,
but on the other hand,

472
00:27:13.230 --> 00:27:18.210
the guy was loyal because he paid his debts.
A lot of people like that.

473
00:27:18.211 --> 00:27:20.220
I'll just say,
suck my Dick.
What are you going to do with John?

474
00:27:20.221 --> 00:27:23.920
Gotti paid his debts.
He paid every fucking dead.

475
00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.550
Nobody ever said the guy didn't pay his debt to pay this debt,

476
00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:31.320
but he was disgusting gamble.
He's so weird.
My boss,

477
00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:35.700
he was all the sudden like he was a star.
It was really strange.

478
00:27:35.910 --> 00:27:39.140
It was like the first one that seemed to like relish the role.
You know,

479
00:27:39.141 --> 00:27:41.220
remember when they couldn't catch him with anything and they'd call him the

480
00:27:41.221 --> 00:27:42.150
Teflon Don.

481
00:27:42.151 --> 00:27:46.440
And he thought that he'd had that big bald dude that it was a mafia tile style

482
00:27:46.441 --> 00:27:50.850
lawyer.
Remember that?
What was that guy's name?
Yes.
Bruce Cutler.
Yes.

483
00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:54.900
And he was his lawyer and he was like the celebrity lawyer for John Gotti and

484
00:27:54.901 --> 00:27:57.240
heal the way,
the way he always defended them.
It was like,
Whoa,

485
00:27:57.450 --> 00:28:02.450
this guy's got this like super intelligent bulldog legal guy on his side and

486
00:28:02.641 --> 00:28:06.900
he's just,
just gonna just fucking do battle with the system.
Meanwhile,

487
00:28:06.901 --> 00:28:08.360
everybody knows he's a,
you know,

488
00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.490
he's the head of organized crime and they're trying to figure out how to pin it

489
00:28:11.491 --> 00:28:14.970
on him.
It was the weirdest thing watching it all play out.
Like in the news.

490
00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:16.013
It's like,
how has this guy,

491
00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:19.620
this guy is just running around like you'd know he's the organized crime guy and

492
00:28:19.621 --> 00:28:23.910
they're just trying to figure out how to bust them.
Like it's a real strange,

493
00:28:23.911 --> 00:28:28.750
it's like watching like law and order play out like that where they,
they're,

494
00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:31.170
they're convinced the guy is guilty,

495
00:28:31.171 --> 00:28:34.470
but they can't get a conviction for a long time.

496
00:28:34.471 --> 00:28:37.220
They couldn't get a conviction on him.
Right?
I mean,
that's,

497
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:41.100
that was his nickname is the beauty of,
is a,
is a May.
We're going to New York.

498
00:28:41.340 --> 00:28:42.930
I don't know if Brian's going to know who's going.

499
00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.960
So dot already and within a minute.

500
00:28:44.970 --> 00:28:47.940
And one of the nights when we get that we're going to go to sparks steak house

501
00:28:47.941 --> 00:28:50.450
and park outside.
Is that the place where,
uh,

502
00:28:50.570 --> 00:28:54.030
you just got to park outside and I want you to just sit close your eyes and

503
00:28:54.031 --> 00:28:59.031
think about the balls it takes to shoot somebody at five 30 on Christmas a week

504
00:29:01.980 --> 00:29:05.660
at that place.
Just the balls too.

505
00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:09.300
Because once he did that,
who's going to argue with you?
Right?

506
00:29:09.330 --> 00:29:13.190
You didn't shoot him in the head.
He didn't poison him.
He got five guy,
he talked,

507
00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:17.370
taught five guys.
So he went and plugged Brodie,
Ari Dunkin,

508
00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:21.210
and to going around the kind of shooting this motherfucker when he comes out and

509
00:29:21.211 --> 00:29:24.570
he got away with it in broad daylight.
All of them shot him at once.

510
00:29:24.630 --> 00:29:29.400
All of the five fucking guns coming at your pap and grow on a only cried Gravano

511
00:29:29.401 --> 00:29:33.420
and whatever.
We're in a car and he talked five guys to shoot.

512
00:29:33.421 --> 00:29:37.140
They call themselves the fist to five hands and they just went out there and

513
00:29:37.141 --> 00:29:41.920
shot this motherfucking five 30 at night,
December 15th or something.

514
00:29:42.250 --> 00:29:45.250
<v 3>When you sit there and you feel what it takes to get that,</v>

515
00:29:46.270 --> 00:29:51.010
that's when you'll go,
I get it.
I get what this guy did.
He did.
You know,

516
00:29:51.011 --> 00:29:55.570
he,
he uh,
he did something that was on,
you know,

517
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:56.441
that's amazing.

518
00:29:56.441 --> 00:30:00.970
Shooting somebody at the House of Blues at eight o'clock at night during the

519
00:30:00.971 --> 00:30:04.180
premiere.
This guy did something that was just ballsy.

520
00:30:04.330 --> 00:30:08.220
There was no argument after that.
Like he just took off.
So what?

521
00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:09.490
What was it that everybody thought?

522
00:30:09.491 --> 00:30:12.220
It was just so crazy after that that he had to do that.

523
00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:15.070
They were going to kill him because he was selling heroin.
He said,

524
00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:19.540
I'm going or you're going bitch.
And he would talk to everybody and he goes,

525
00:30:19.541 --> 00:30:22.090
here's the deal.
I'll cut you as in,
we'll all become millionaires,

526
00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:25.720
but this motherfucker's got to go.
Whoa.
And they sat down,

527
00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:28.540
they set up a fake meeting to meet everybody there.

528
00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.930
And these motherfuckers got out of the car and five guys got out dressed was

529
00:30:31.931 --> 00:30:33.520
Russians with the hats,

530
00:30:33.521 --> 00:30:37.780
with the little jackets like they were donating and started unloading on these

531
00:30:37.781 --> 00:30:40.380
guys.
Whoa,
look at the pictures.
Look at the pictures,

532
00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:43.420
the guys on the street with a top item,
but blood coming out.

533
00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:47.980
But the thing would happen with God.
He is what Alex Jones talks about.

534
00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:53.800
They went after God.
The first time,
God,
he fucked him up spitting that face.
God.

535
00:30:53.801 --> 00:30:56.590
He will listen.
When you beat the government,
you take your money,

536
00:30:56.591 --> 00:31:00.190
you take your pieces and you go home.
The government ain't gonna stand that.

537
00:31:00.191 --> 00:31:03.560
The government is a business.
The government puts $1 million a year,

538
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:04.840
the following Joe Rogan.

539
00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:07.960
Eventually we're going to collect on that investment and we're going to do

540
00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:12.520
whatever it takes to collect on that investment.
My friend,
that's it.

541
00:31:12.610 --> 00:31:16.000
Plain and simple.
When the government wants you,
they're coming to get you.

542
00:31:16.030 --> 00:31:19.660
And that's one situation where he beat him.
He beat him with jewelry.
Tamping,

543
00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:23.050
they went back at him,
he beat him again with something.

544
00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:27.040
Then they put wires everywhere,
which the wires a fucking illegal.

545
00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:29.830
They put them everywhere and they still,
but the guy talked,

546
00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:33.010
they're not illegal anymore.
No,
but the guy,
uh,
you know,

547
00:31:33.011 --> 00:31:36.370
the guy heard himself talking.
I mean the guy was a moron.
Let's face it,

548
00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:37.593
he hurts himself.

549
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:43.230
He's just such a buck wild guy to be in control of an organized crime or you

550
00:31:43.451 --> 00:31:47.650
know,
a big thing like the mob people bringing you money.

551
00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:50.230
Can you imagine crazy?

552
00:31:50.231 --> 00:31:54.700
Well just come on Thursdays and bring you 80,000 Tripoli brings you a hundred

553
00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:57.850
grand.
I bring you 40.
This is it.
This is what you do.

554
00:31:57.910 --> 00:32:00.850
Can you imagine if all wires were illegal?
Like all wires?

555
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:05.230
Our white wires everywhere.
Like you weren't allowed to have wires.

556
00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:09.640
Fuck,
are you talking?
You know,

557
00:32:09.641 --> 00:32:13.940
and it's very sad that the government doesn't know.
Is that all right?
Cool.

558
00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:15.850
Gravano whatever the fuck you want.
I mean,
you know,

559
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.210
I just read something the other day about this motherfucker that got gotta re

560
00:32:19.211 --> 00:32:22.840
convict them because at night he's still alive.
He's still alive,

561
00:32:22.841 --> 00:32:26.620
but he's all fucked up crazy and 80 he's in Colorado and Tomahawk under the

562
00:32:26.621 --> 00:32:29.830
fucking prison and he's all fucked up from the steroids.

563
00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:32.080
His hair fell out of his teeth are falling out.

564
00:32:32.081 --> 00:32:35.890
He's got some central nervous disease like Mitzi shore.
You shakes and shit.

565
00:32:35.891 --> 00:32:40.710
God bless him.
But
the fuck you blessed.

566
00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.210
You know when the government took,

567
00:32:42.211 --> 00:32:46.240
Kevin talked to him and pretty much riding on this guy.
You know what?

568
00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:49.210
They just really,
they just realized all his sins that he never capture.

569
00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:51.900
Now he's getting convicted because now they've drawn everything out.

570
00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:54.710
And 83 he was going around buy lottery tickets.

571
00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:57.090
So he you knew in the neighborhood,

572
00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:00.770
if you hit the lottery for 800,000 it was a million comes to Gravano.

573
00:33:00.771 --> 00:33:03.350
He'll buy the ticket because then he had a legal way of getting income.

574
00:33:03.810 --> 00:33:07.080
Let me fucking tickets.
He bought that year he'd tickets.

575
00:33:07.081 --> 00:33:11.510
That idiot bought that year,
800 a million cash.
He bought off the people.

576
00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:15.290
Holy Shit.
So he would have annuities.
Oh Wow.

577
00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:18.690
So it just made it look like he was just winning the lottery left to right.

578
00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:22.410
Everybody in his house wasn't a lottery.
One year,
the daughter,

579
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:30.170
you know that Whitey Bulger did that to Whitey Bolger won the lottery twice.

580
00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:35.610
The balls are these cocksuckers never ends.

581
00:33:36.170 --> 00:33:39.950
But here's the weird thing that I've told you this before,
when at the end,

582
00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:44.120
after they had Gravano,
when they will make it a loan,
shark collections,

583
00:33:44.810 --> 00:33:47.420
he was still calling the people going,
I don't give a fuck if I'm in prison.

584
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:49.760
You're going to have to feds go home,
buy it and pick it up.
The money,

585
00:33:49.761 --> 00:33:51.620
faster crowd.
That's documented.

586
00:33:51.621 --> 00:33:55.340
The people plan and clouds how much they wanted,

587
00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:57.800
but they kind of deal with the devil.

588
00:33:57.801 --> 00:34:01.470
They just cut a deal with the devil just to go after fucking this degenerate new

589
00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:05.300
do.
Ivana was like easily just as bad.
Right.
I mean,

590
00:34:05.301 --> 00:34:09.320
the stuff that he had done justice bad,
right.
He murdered a bunch of people,

591
00:34:09.321 --> 00:34:12.230
right?
Yeah,
but he was,
he wasn't like a straight up guy.

592
00:34:12.231 --> 00:34:16.110
He was like a fucking con guy icon.
Like you were big.
Oh God out.
Yeah.

593
00:34:16.170 --> 00:34:19.040
He got out for a while.
That's what people don't understand.

594
00:34:19.041 --> 00:34:23.930
Like the government let a known killer out.
He talked him out of it.
He was a,

595
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:29.120
he was a tremendous negotiated.
He got the keepers 20 million.

596
00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:32.750
He got five years and that was it.

597
00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:36.350
He got to keep his 20 million from illegal and devotees and then what happened?

598
00:34:36.351 --> 00:34:39.680
He was like selling ecstasy in Arizona,
Arizona.

599
00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:41.870
That's when we met the daughter at the Improv.

600
00:34:42.170 --> 00:34:44.540
The daughter came through his show that time,
the one,

601
00:34:44.541 --> 00:34:48.590
that's how my boys now that Chubby one came to one of our shows and the Tempe

602
00:34:48.591 --> 00:34:52.130
one time with your buddy.
The [inaudible] or the bodybuilding guy.

603
00:34:52.131 --> 00:34:55.610
He had a bunch of boards with him and in front of I said something about the

604
00:34:55.611 --> 00:34:59.150
town that Sammy the bull and afterwards he goes,
I got his daughter here.

605
00:34:59.151 --> 00:35:02.510
Be careful what you're saying.
Well that was his daughter that was there with us.

606
00:35:02.511 --> 00:35:05.420
That one.
This is [inaudible] 98 I can barely remember,

607
00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:09.130
but I'm kind of remembering it now.
Yeah,
that was a lot of freaks dog.

608
00:35:10.100 --> 00:35:11.870
Well Arizona's this range.

609
00:35:12.430 --> 00:35:16.430
Strange Ryan pointed out to me once we were in Scottsdale and we were hanging

610
00:35:16.431 --> 00:35:19.760
out and having a good old time and Brian goes,
everyone's on coke.

611
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:23.610
Everybody else you look around going to say he,

612
00:35:23.780 --> 00:35:27.920
he clued me in on the the mannerisms and he goes,
go walk up to them.

613
00:35:27.921 --> 00:35:31.130
They'll be having a conversation whether it be really fucking sincere but there

614
00:35:31.190 --> 00:35:34.930
could be talking about what's better,
coke or Pepsi.
Love it.

615
00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:38.700
Like right when I say that we looked over and everybody at the same time,

616
00:35:38.701 --> 00:35:42.810
it's like wiping their nose and going down like this.
Like it was just weird.

617
00:35:42.811 --> 00:35:46.290
It was like a movie.
It was.
If it was,
if it was in a movie,

618
00:35:46.291 --> 00:35:48.420
it would be too over the top.
You'd be like,
Nah,

619
00:35:48.421 --> 00:35:51.570
there's not that many people on Coke at the club,
but this place was,

620
00:35:51.571 --> 00:35:54.930
it was ridiculous.
I don't know if it's still like that.
You know,

621
00:35:54.931 --> 00:35:59.610
cultures that coke the coke comes and goes,
like people always gonna want coke,

622
00:35:59.730 --> 00:36:02.430
but the coke cultures like kind of die off a little bit.

623
00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:04.980
There's a lot of people try to get their act together.
You know,

624
00:36:04.981 --> 00:36:08.250
there's a lot of people don't like the way that that wrecks their fucking body

625
00:36:08.251 --> 00:36:09.900
and they're trying to get out of it.
I really,

626
00:36:09.901 --> 00:36:14.130
really put white powder on your nose.
You're
really,
really,

627
00:36:14.131 --> 00:36:17.040
really am.
I really,
really,

628
00:36:17.041 --> 00:36:20.400
really would like to know the amount of coke that comes into just our country

629
00:36:20.401 --> 00:36:23.510
every year just to figure it the fuck out.
Do you think like,

630
00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:26.460
I don't like gotta be,
it's gotta be in the metric targets.

631
00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:29.760
Where do you think it's coming in?
How do you think it's getting here in Mexico,

632
00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:34.860
but what,
like who's bringing it down and say like big cut their hands.

633
00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:38.970
The Columbia is growing now and they said,
look,
we've got too much money.
Really.

634
00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:41.370
We've been doing this for eight years,
was sick of this shit.

635
00:36:41.371 --> 00:36:46.230
Cotton and governments and helicopters could do this.
Come down by a package,

636
00:36:48.030 --> 00:36:52.010
so it's an awesome neighborhood.
They get the old days.
He the Colombians.

637
00:36:52.011 --> 00:36:55.890
In the old days,
a guy named Carlos like dad went to the metal link card Coulson.

638
00:36:55.891 --> 00:36:57.990
You motherfuckers don't know nothing about transporting.

639
00:36:58.290 --> 00:37:02.040
You guys are missing the boat here.
You guys are just salad.
Fuck that shit.

640
00:37:02.070 --> 00:37:05.220
We're going to sell it,
transport it,
take it to the United States,
cut it,

641
00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:08.490
sell it again and we're going to take all that profit a to z.

642
00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:11.550
We're just not going to make our money and ABC.
We're going to go a to Z,

643
00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:14.310
right to the fucking streets.
We're going to put our people in there.

644
00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.020
This guy was a college educated fucking coke dealer and he went and he booked

645
00:37:18.021 --> 00:37:20.160
that island,
Barbados,
whatever.

646
00:37:20.161 --> 00:37:22.950
The one that blow that's supposed to be Carlos laid there.

647
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:27.420
He was the one that the methylene cartel gave him up when Bush wanted something.

648
00:37:27.421 --> 00:37:30.440
I got to get some guys.
You guys are down there and making millions.
We've got,

649
00:37:31.210 --> 00:37:31.680
you know,

650
00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:35.340
because they went down and just told Noriega Tova give us the keys to your back

651
00:37:35.341 --> 00:37:36.870
book.
Give us your back book.

652
00:37:36.871 --> 00:37:40.620
Give us the name of the dealer because we're in on that 10% and we're taking

653
00:37:40.621 --> 00:37:42.030
everything you're getting.
You know what you're getting.

654
00:37:42.031 --> 00:37:45.870
What's behind door number?
Hey,
20,000 a plane ticket and the Yo,
Yo,

655
00:37:47.850 --> 00:37:49.320
we always throw in a Yo,
Yo,

656
00:37:49.321 --> 00:37:54.120
you know what Louis North Noriega was an unknown drug trafficker,
right?

657
00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:57.570
That was the deal.
He was just running Panama,
right?
It's the real deal.

658
00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.660
Here's the deal with the Colombians.
Colombians have a saying,
what?

659
00:38:00.661 --> 00:38:04.840
Six same Bryant,
blah,
blah,
blah.
That's not what I was thinking.

660
00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:08.160
That means maybe you're taking a bundle or you're taking cash.

661
00:38:08.190 --> 00:38:12.000
I know you're Catholic and you're Christian and your wife goes to church every

662
00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.390
Sunday,
but it's either boom or whatever Bob Butoh plop out.

663
00:38:15.870 --> 00:38:17.550
So it will be your corrupt or not.

664
00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:19.710
You either take the money or with a pull of blood.
You had them.

665
00:38:19.711 --> 00:38:22.290
We're gonna replace you with somebody who will take the money.
I was thinking,

666
00:38:22.291 --> 00:38:25.200
puts them on to Noriega.
Noriega was,

667
00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:28.710
and then there's funneling hundreds of millions of pounds of coke to his island.

668
00:38:28.950 --> 00:38:31.550
And let's pretend he's getting a penny of fucking ounce.

669
00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:34.830
It is a kind of an amazing gangster movie though.
You got it,
man.

670
00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:40.090
<v 2>All of them.
I mean,
if you look at,
if you just look at human civilization,</v>

671
00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:44.830
if you looked at it as like a a numbers game and saw the incredible scores,

672
00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:49.340
the United States is pulled off,
you know,
putting,
putting side over,

673
00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:53.800
say it in the power,
arming him.
Two pictures of him shaking his hand.
If you know,

674
00:38:53.810 --> 00:38:55.240
the years later,
it's storming.

675
00:38:55.241 --> 00:38:59.400
Is City shooting missiles and hanging him on a stairwell awesome.

676
00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:03.150
Just before they're gonna go on 60 minutes.
Those motherfuckers,
it's amazing.

677
00:39:04.090 --> 00:39:06.880
It's beautiful.
It's amazing.
I mean,
look,
it's,

678
00:39:06.881 --> 00:39:10.130
it's terrible and it's horrible and it's awful and it's,
it's,
it's,
it's,

679
00:39:10.210 --> 00:39:12.700
it's disgusting that that's how humanity works.

680
00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:16.030
But if you just look at it from like a sheer mathematic standpoint,
like,
wow,

681
00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:19.180
what does,
that's why it's staggering achievement.

682
00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:23.200
This one fucked up country as you know,
has had all over the world.

683
00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:26.710
That's shit you posted the other day,
dude.
It was tripping me out.
But which one?

684
00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:31.270
Like the ones and Zeros or everything's a code and fucking codes inside.

685
00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:33.640
That is a really bizarre,

686
00:39:33.670 --> 00:39:37.990
I have to go over that a bunch of times because there's a lot of gobbilty goop.

687
00:39:38.050 --> 00:39:43.030
I don't understand.
I don't,
you know,
I,
it was,
it was a Neil Tyson degrasse,

688
00:39:43.031 --> 00:39:47.280
is that how you say it?
Yeah.
And it was another professor and um,

689
00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:50.860
I don't remember the other professor's name and I should look that up because it

690
00:39:50.861 --> 00:39:53.020
was a really fascinating,
but what,

691
00:39:53.021 --> 00:39:54.700
I don't understand that what they're pretty much,

692
00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:59.500
they're finding a code computer code and things.

693
00:39:59.501 --> 00:40:02.860
I can't now that that's the part problem I had trying to figure out like what

694
00:40:02.861 --> 00:40:07.030
were the things that they're finding the code in but what they were kind of

695
00:40:07.031 --> 00:40:11.740
getting at that for some reason that they're finding that life seems to be a

696
00:40:11.741 --> 00:40:16.741
computer code and that we might all be a semi assimilation of are like ourselves

697
00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:22.270
simulating ourselves and like a computer right now.
Yeah.
This is a,
this is,

698
00:40:22.271 --> 00:40:26.350
by the way,
this is really fairly recent to this whole thing.

699
00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:29.020
You could pull it up and this guy can uh,
can,

700
00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:32.650
can say it and we can sort of like figuring out what the fuck it means.

701
00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:37.860
Just do have on youtube a strange computer code discovered concealed in

702
00:40:38.831 --> 00:40:42.360
superstring code,

703
00:40:42.380 --> 00:40:47.230
discovered concealed in superstring equations.

704
00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:50.440
What the fuck's a super,
let's,
let's,

705
00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:55.470
let's let him talk and then try to ape our way through the most rudimentary of

706
00:40:57.490 --> 00:41:01.750
explanations.
Yeah.
That,
that gentleman with the glasses but whole code before

707
00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:10.390
the opening.
It was weird.
Yeah.
Let me get it saying what if it really existed?

708
00:41:10.391 --> 00:41:15.391
Meet Professor James Gates Jr theoretical physicists and John as told professor

709
00:41:15.941 --> 00:41:17.650
of physics.
At the University of Maryland.

710
00:41:17.651 --> 00:41:22.390
This is all like on the screen with graphics while working on super string

711
00:41:22.391 --> 00:41:26.140
theory,
professor gates discovered something very interesting hidden within the

712
00:41:26.141 --> 00:41:28.270
equations.
See for yourself,

713
00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:32.170
one of the viewers responsible for his own conclusions.

714
00:41:32.171 --> 00:41:34.400
My channel's not responsible for any potential mental

715
00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:37.130
<v 4>instability.
This main sea,
are they,
are they trolling?</v>

716
00:41:37.970 --> 00:41:41.520
Viewer discretion is advised.
Are they trolling?
Here we go.
It's march seven well,

717
00:41:41.530 --> 00:41:45.070
partly it's taken to this very strange images that are behind your head right

718
00:41:45.071 --> 00:41:45.880
now.

719
00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:50.880
These are pictures of equations I've been for the last 15 years trying to answer

720
00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:53.670
the kinds of questions that my colleagues here have.

721
00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:56.890
Habit reasoning and what I've come to understand is that there are these

722
00:41:56.891 --> 00:42:01.480
incredible pictures that contained all the information of a set of equations

723
00:42:01.481 --> 00:42:02.740
that are related to string theory.

724
00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:06.640
And it's even more bizarre than that because when you then try to understand

725
00:42:06.641 --> 00:42:10.720
these pictures,
you find out that buried in them,
our computer codes,

726
00:42:10.930 --> 00:42:15.250
just like the type that you find in the browser,
when you go surf the web,

727
00:42:15.790 --> 00:42:20.790
you say your attempt to understand the fundamental operations of nature leads

728
00:42:21.191 --> 00:42:25.720
you to a set of equations that are indistinguishable from the equations that

729
00:42:25.721 --> 00:42:30.550
drive search engines and browsers on our computers.
That is correct.

730
00:42:30.610 --> 00:42:34.750
So I'm still,
wait,
I have to just be silent

731
00:42:36.290 --> 00:42:39.490
to lunch.
That again.
So you're saying as you dig deeper,

732
00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:46.080
you find computer code written in the fabric of the cosmos into the equations

733
00:42:51.011 --> 00:42:55.900
that we want to use to describe the cosmos.
Yes.
Computer Code,
Computer Code,

734
00:42:55.901 --> 00:42:58.210
strings of bits of ones and Zeros.

735
00:42:58.570 --> 00:43:01.720
It's not just sort of resembles computer code.

736
00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:05.980
You're saying it is computer code.
It's not even just his computer code.

737
00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:09.970
It's a special kind of computer code that was invented by a scientist named

738
00:43:09.971 --> 00:43:13.240
Claude Shannon and the 1940s that's what we find very,

739
00:43:13.270 --> 00:43:18.270
very currently inside the equations that occur in string theory and in general

740
00:43:18.581 --> 00:43:21.280
in systems that we get caught say are supersymmetric.

741
00:43:21.820 --> 00:43:25.540
Some of those codes are showing on the screen behind you right now.

742
00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:27.010
They don't look like codes,

743
00:43:27.011 --> 00:43:32.011
but these pictures which we call a dink groves or graphical representations of

744
00:43:32.261 --> 00:43:37.261
sets of equations that are based on codes that in the description of our

745
00:43:38.141 --> 00:43:42.490
universe that is a super symmetrical universe which we were gonna test in the

746
00:43:42.491 --> 00:43:45.640
LHC.
If you believe that description,

747
00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:48.820
I can show you the presence of these codes.
That's my statement.

748
00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:53.810
Do you have any protect predictions in your ideas or any ways to test any
videos,

749
00:43:53.830 --> 00:43:56.080
any more than saying the guy over on the screen?

750
00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:00.160
The work that I'm doing is in fact Sophia radical that we don't,

751
00:44:00.161 --> 00:44:04.630
we don't understand yet whether it is even possible to complete the program.

752
00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:07.030
We have found these strange graphs.

753
00:44:07.240 --> 00:44:11.020
We know that they are equivalent to equations and we have found in these

754
00:44:11.021 --> 00:44:15.400
equations computer codes and so that's where we are right now.

755
00:44:15.401 --> 00:44:18.550
So I cannot give you a prediction.
This work is less than two years old.

756
00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:19.421
Jesus Christ.

757
00:44:19.421 --> 00:44:23.590
I don't understand a fucking word what you're saying that that was like I do and

758
00:44:23.591 --> 00:44:25.900
I don't folks,
if you're at home screaming,
listening to this,

759
00:44:25.901 --> 00:44:30.901
well what he's trying to see quite simply is that the computer that they're to

760
00:44:32.071 --> 00:44:35.910
decipher everything that the equation,

761
00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:40.770
the math that they're using to explain the,
the Co has code in it,

762
00:44:40.771 --> 00:44:42.900
but that's like,
that makes no sense.

763
00:44:42.900 --> 00:44:46.560
Very difficult to wrap your head around because what I understand was that he

764
00:44:46.561 --> 00:44:51.561
was saying the computer that they're using to represent all this stuff,

765
00:44:52.291 --> 00:44:53.190
they're finding it,

766
00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:56.190
they're finding the code in it when they're trying to represent it with a

767
00:44:56.191 --> 00:44:59.520
computer.
Right.
I,
I don't know what that means.

768
00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:04.080
I heard like the equations that they're using to explain this string theory or

769
00:45:04.081 --> 00:45:07.630
something like that,
like in those equations,
they're finding computer code,
right?

770
00:45:08.150 --> 00:45:12.150
Like what's an equation?
There's an equation already.
Fucking math.

771
00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:15.960
I'm not quite sure what they're trying to say by by saying that,

772
00:45:17.320 --> 00:45:20.490
it's like as they're following,
as they're using their computer code,

773
00:45:20.491 --> 00:45:24.480
the computer represents the universe or he represents whatever they're trying to

774
00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:26.460
zero in on.

775
00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:31.740
Then they see a pattern that exists in ones and Zeros and they're saying that

776
00:45:31.741 --> 00:45:36.741
it's very clear that it's a specific type of pattern that was a invented by one

777
00:45:36.991 --> 00:45:40.110
certain sciences,
so,
so they know exactly what the code should be,

778
00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:43.620
but what the fuck does that mean?
Or this isn't really hilarious.

779
00:45:43.621 --> 00:45:48.240
Improv comedy class video,
Viral v w we have to stop.

780
00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:50.090
I mean it sounds stupid.
All right.
This is,

781
00:45:50.610 --> 00:45:54.690
this is one of those weird conversations where you got to go walk.

782
00:45:54.691 --> 00:45:56.790
Why are you even bothering to have this conversation?

783
00:45:56.791 --> 00:46:01.710
But the reality is when you look at some of the video games that are available

784
00:46:01.711 --> 00:46:03.750
right now just for your iPad and this,

785
00:46:03.751 --> 00:46:07.710
this is an incredible leap of say just mean my lifetime.

786
00:46:07.711 --> 00:46:11.760
I was around when Pong came out,
when we had pong,
when I was a kid,

787
00:46:11.761 --> 00:46:12.630
it was the shit.

788
00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:15.540
He couldn't believe that you could make something move on the TV.

789
00:46:15.570 --> 00:46:18.780
And it was a black and white TV by the way.
We were playing pong.

790
00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:23.820
And to go from that in our lifetime to what we're seeing now graphically,

791
00:46:24.570 --> 00:46:29.570
I can only imagine that if you could go a thousand years forward from now,

792
00:46:30.890 --> 00:46:32.870
can you imagine we were,

793
00:46:32.871 --> 00:46:36.970
we're easily going to have some sort of an artificial reality real.

794
00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:39.660
The real question is,
is this it?

795
00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:44.380
Is this the artificial reality of some other reality?
Are We,
you know,

796
00:46:44.610 --> 00:46:48.690
are we plugged in somewhere?
I mean,
there's this really like the fucking matrix.

797
00:46:48.691 --> 00:46:50.770
I mean,
are we in some sort of a,
a,

798
00:46:50.771 --> 00:46:55.771
a perfect state of being able to completely control reality and some distant

799
00:46:56.641 --> 00:47:00.060
point in the future where we're just locking our consciousness and do these

800
00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:04.380
crazy scenarios?
I,
when I first heard this,
when you first tweeted it,

801
00:47:04.410 --> 00:47:08.400
I now find myself trying to do something like to get out of this thing.

802
00:47:08.401 --> 00:47:10.920
And now I think I'm going crazy.
Like I was talking to my cat and I'm like,

803
00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:13.890
if you know this is a simulation,
like like lick your lips right now,

804
00:47:13.891 --> 00:47:16.340
you know he's doing that kind of test and

805
00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:22.880
like I'm looking now to see if I could hack if this is a reality thing.

806
00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:27.150
But when you hear stuff like when you hear stuff like this that you don't quite

807
00:47:27.151 --> 00:47:27.800
understand,

808
00:47:27.800 --> 00:47:31.360
but what they're trying to say essentially is it's there's some sort of a code

809
00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:34.360
everything and then it looks like,
you know like look,

810
00:47:34.370 --> 00:47:37.390
it looks like even like the possibly as it had been designed,

811
00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:40.450
I mean they didn't say that specifically,
but that you know,
the,

812
00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:42.290
if there is a mathematical code doodle,

813
00:47:42.310 --> 00:47:46.420
not even saying designed by like an entity,
maybe just designed by nature,

814
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:48.130
you know,
whatever the fuck it is.

815
00:47:48.370 --> 00:47:51.730
But you got to think that they're going to be able to,

816
00:47:51.790 --> 00:47:54.250
they're going to be able to simulate that eventually they're gonna.

817
00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:55.840
If they can get to that,

818
00:47:56.110 --> 00:47:58.600
they're going to go from that and then they're going to go to the next stage.

819
00:47:58.601 --> 00:48:00.630
What does the next stage,
you know,

820
00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:04.330
how do they take things for the house technology take us further and further

821
00:48:04.331 --> 00:48:07.540
down the road till the point where we might one day be living inside a fucking

822
00:48:07.541 --> 00:48:10.850
computer program and that shit might be going on right now.
It's

823
00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:13.900
<v 3>totally man.
It's one of those conversations.</v>

824
00:48:13.901 --> 00:48:16.640
What a fucking trip that will be and what if it's live?
It is.

825
00:48:16.690 --> 00:48:19.690
What if it's something like,
like remember when you were in elementary last show.

826
00:48:19.691 --> 00:48:21.560
He's fucking picking shit up and stared at it.

827
00:48:22.170 --> 00:48:25.370
He stared at a USB cable like into the secrets to the University of it.

828
00:48:28.590 --> 00:48:31.030
We went way too deep into the wood.
If drawer for Joe Dog.

829
00:48:31.031 --> 00:48:33.490
I ain't a fucking half chocolate triple Bob before.

830
00:48:33.491 --> 00:48:36.700
I know you guys are scaring me.
Like Star Trek.
What does she,

831
00:48:36.710 --> 00:48:39.670
she came out and I was a kid.
I was always scared of Star Trek.
The music.

832
00:48:39.671 --> 00:48:42.100
I would shut that motherfucker off as long.
As soon as I heard

833
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:48.130
fucking shut that TV off,
I switch off or something.
What if we come out of this,

834
00:48:48.190 --> 00:48:51.520
this virtual reality world and it's something like we go back to him like third

835
00:48:51.521 --> 00:48:52.840
grade when we were having to,

836
00:48:53.130 --> 00:48:56.700
they were checking us for lice and that's when they started it.
Like they like,

837
00:48:56.920 --> 00:49:00.160
they like fucking like put a needle in the back of her neck and then send it,

838
00:49:00.161 --> 00:49:03.730
put us in this pod and then like you wake up and you're that kid again and

839
00:49:03.731 --> 00:49:04.570
you're like,
hmm.
All right.

840
00:49:04.571 --> 00:49:07.690
So that's exactly what life is and that's how it could happen,
you know,

841
00:49:07.691 --> 00:49:10.930
and stuff.
Wow.
And you're like great style.

842
00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:13.400
You don't like when somebody goes to you don't like what?

843
00:49:13.920 --> 00:49:15.360
I'm not sure I follow you.
I'm not going to just to,

844
00:49:15.570 --> 00:49:18.910
just to explain it a little better because this is what fucks me up all the time

845
00:49:19.230 --> 00:49:20.650
and this is what I see happening.

846
00:49:20.651 --> 00:49:25.651
That fucking kills me being alive and say a hundred years number,

847
00:49:25.770 --> 00:49:27.550
the Hannibal and one of those stupid movies,

848
00:49:27.551 --> 00:49:31.340
he drew a picture and she came to visit him and she goes,
did you draw that?

849
00:49:31.341 --> 00:49:34.530
And he goes,
I drew from memory and he's Spiderman.
During the face.
Yeah.

850
00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:39.400
Well that was migs.
It's really weird because people do that.

851
00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:43.690
They go somewhere and they just remember something that they seen from it and

852
00:49:43.691 --> 00:49:47.020
they draw something from memory,
which is pretty fucking brilliant,

853
00:49:47.380 --> 00:49:49.750
especially when you have little things that nobody else would know.

854
00:49:49.751 --> 00:49:52.240
That means you caught that why you were there,
you know,

855
00:49:52.241 --> 00:49:55.840
which really weird that maybe 30 40 years from now you could put a hat on,

856
00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:00.640
close your fucking eyes.
You can go to Italy for the day.
Yeah,
yeah.

857
00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:05.760
Or the forever day and come back and it's going to cost you $89 and you're going

858
00:50:06.231 --> 00:50:10.060
to get on a bus tour.
And the truly gonna fucking take you.
Have you ever had,

859
00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:10.460
<v 4>uh,</v>

860
00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:14.430
it experienced any sort of a psychedelic experience that you felt like lasted a

861
00:50:14.431 --> 00:50:18.570
long time and then you came back and it was like,
you know,
you,
you,
it would only,

862
00:50:18.571 --> 00:50:20.430
it only been like 10 minutes,
20 minutes.

863
00:50:23.250 --> 00:50:27.680
<v 3>That's what that are said.
He said he went somewhere for over a month.</v>

864
00:50:27.860 --> 00:50:30.050
He said he was the,
I think he said for months,

865
00:50:30.051 --> 00:50:33.290
he felt like he felt like he had friendships there and he was going to miss

866
00:50:33.291 --> 00:50:36.260
people and he was like living in some strange fucking

867
00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:42.020
parallel world.
No Salvia.
And he said he came back 10 minutes later and he was,

868
00:50:42.021 --> 00:50:44.960
and he was just completely freaked out.
It took them so hard,

869
00:50:44.961 --> 00:50:48.260
it was so hard for him to readjust because only 10 minutes have gone by.

870
00:50:48.350 --> 00:50:51.500
But to him months had gone by now.
So I,
but we,

871
00:50:51.560 --> 00:50:54.800
we talked about on the podcast and I can all these tweets from other people that

872
00:50:54.801 --> 00:50:57.700
said they had the exact same thing happen to them.
You feel like,

873
00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:01.340
like while it's happening though,
you have like this weird sense that like,
Hey,

874
00:51:01.341 --> 00:51:05.810
I know all about this already.
Like I've been here,
I've felt this before.

875
00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:09.710
And you know like that's the craziest part about the DMT experience.

876
00:51:09.770 --> 00:51:12.810
The craziest part about that is that that same feeling of [inaudible],

877
00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:17.180
I know this.
Yeah,
I know this place.
I know what I'm saying.

878
00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:22.520
When I first started tripping.
I like tripping with a group.

879
00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:25.430
When I was 1514 you tripped with a group,
right?

880
00:51:25.690 --> 00:51:28.880
It was a completely different experience.
When we all pop it together,
it's six,

881
00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:31.820
we drink beers,
we wrote 15 joints and smoke them,

882
00:51:31.821 --> 00:51:35.150
and then eight 30 you're tripping and now you're with friends and you're with a

883
00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:36.050
walked right.

884
00:51:36.350 --> 00:51:41.350
The scariest thing for me was going home 12 one o'clock because you're by

885
00:51:41.751 --> 00:51:42.760
yourself,
right?

886
00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:46.370
This is the most important part of the trip is answering your questions to

887
00:51:46.371 --> 00:51:49.730
yourself.
And I'd go home and I go in and out,

888
00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:53.110
like I'd put a pink Floyd out mud,
you know,
dark side of the moon.

889
00:51:53.110 --> 00:51:55.400
And for two songs I was fucking gun,

890
00:51:55.970 --> 00:52:00.800
but for two other songs I was there saying to myself,
Ooh,
I got it together now.

891
00:52:00.900 --> 00:52:03.380
Now I'm ready to dawn.
Thank God this trip has done.

892
00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:07.180
And just as how it was getting up,
that motherfucker came back to it again.

893
00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:09.590
That's the difference when you do really good acid.

894
00:52:09.591 --> 00:52:12.860
Now last week I've been working a lot on my neat with the bike.

895
00:52:12.861 --> 00:52:14.240
You told me stationary bike.

896
00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:18.020
So I usually go over that 45 an hour and I put it on.
And for some reason,

897
00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:21.140
you know,
they always say I was cracking jokes.
You guys wants to,

898
00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:23.990
sometimes you hide your weed and you don't know where you put it,

899
00:52:23.991 --> 00:52:25.820
but you get higher and you'll find it.
You know,

900
00:52:25.821 --> 00:52:29.390
like it's just amazing when you in that consciousness again,
fuck,

901
00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:31.630
I know what my weaknesses are.
The fucking car.
Right.

902
00:52:31.670 --> 00:52:33.110
Just remember cause your eyes right.

903
00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:37.610
And it's show we had the other day I was listening to a bro,
Joe Rogan and Brian,

904
00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:39.020
this is the weirdest thing that happened.

905
00:52:39.410 --> 00:52:44.240
I went early and I had gotten up and I slogan I had a great breakfast and I went

906
00:52:44.241 --> 00:52:49.241
to the thing and I put it on don't quarter by led Zeppelin alive and he's got a

907
00:52:50.061 --> 00:52:52.760
piece in there that's Jimmy page playing the guitar.

908
00:52:53.090 --> 00:52:55.700
That right there and answers all your questions about life.

909
00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:59.210
And I'll never forget what I was sitting there riding the bike.
I'm high.

910
00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:03.050
And it took me to where I was and I remember that it wasn't a fucking,

911
00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:08.020
it wasn't a fuck him.
Nah,
it was at a guy,
Gunter Brown's house that started good,

912
00:53:08.021 --> 00:53:10.670
good,
good,
good.
Gunter Brown.
If you asked me to get another knock it down,

913
00:53:11.090 --> 00:53:13.310
he was like this dirty white guy,
but he was a millionaire.

914
00:53:13.310 --> 00:53:16.460
He's father and vet the Dixie Cup with the jokes or something.

915
00:53:16.730 --> 00:53:19.670
And this guy was basically a junkie.
Like you go over there and he'd say,

916
00:53:19.671 --> 00:53:21.680
you want you to dick stuff that got a chicken will suck your Dick,

917
00:53:21.681 --> 00:53:22.580
why you're taking this shit.

918
00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:26.090
Like he always had weird dirty white women over there.
And one time I went on,

919
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:30.240
I'm like 17 and I did a line of white heroin and he goes,

920
00:53:30.241 --> 00:53:33.240
I got to go run an errand.
I'll be back.
And he left that album on.

921
00:53:34.230 --> 00:53:35.730
And I remember that I was sitting up,

922
00:53:36.810 --> 00:53:41.810
but in my mind I was in my fetal position and I was in my mother's womb and I

923
00:53:43.081 --> 00:53:44.730
could hear her heartbeat.
And even though I was,

924
00:53:44.850 --> 00:53:49.320
all I could hear was Jimmy Page's guitar.
And every time I was straighten up,

925
00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:53.760
I would see people,
they're not judging me.
It was the fucking warmth to the room.

926
00:53:54.270 --> 00:53:56.460
And the warmth was just amazing.
It was too much.

927
00:53:56.461 --> 00:53:59.670
And in one corner was like Buddha,
the other corner was like Jesus.

928
00:53:59.671 --> 00:54:02.370
Every corner was like a God that I didn't even know,
like a Hindu,

929
00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:05.700
a Korean with a fucking sword.
And they weren't that judging me.

930
00:54:05.701 --> 00:54:06.990
They were just there waiting for something.

931
00:54:06.991 --> 00:54:10.800
And I remember I would go into the womb and come out of the womb and every time

932
00:54:10.801 --> 00:54:14.070
I go into the woman coming out of Jimmy page or keep playing that fucking guitar

933
00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:16.890
and I could hear my mother's heartbeat,
my mother was dead this time.

934
00:54:16.891 --> 00:54:19.020
So what's your site?
Keep taking over that fucking trip.

935
00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:21.150
And I get here and every time I would pop up,

936
00:54:21.151 --> 00:54:23.880
I would see every woman that ever came into my life dog,

937
00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:27.870
whether I knew them or not.
Your lunch woman,
your first grade teacher,

938
00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:31.950
the fucking nurse that delivered you to your mother's hands and all of a sudden

939
00:54:31.951 --> 00:54:32.220
dog.

940
00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:37.220
I remember the Virgin Mary came out doing a strip fucking teas and this is why I

941
00:54:37.411 --> 00:54:37.771
was,

942
00:54:37.771 --> 00:54:40.680
I'm in this fucking thing and I don't want to look at the Virgin Mary's Pussy,

943
00:54:41.070 --> 00:54:44.550
but she takes off her fucking number these and I'll never forget that her pussy

944
00:54:44.551 --> 00:54:48.420
was like a picture of me at that age and there was a guy sitting there the whole

945
00:54:48.421 --> 00:54:50.400
time I'm sitting in this room position,

946
00:54:50.730 --> 00:54:53.880
but there's a guy with his back to me going,
you don't need the answers.

947
00:54:53.881 --> 00:54:54.714
They got fear.

948
00:54:55.200 --> 00:54:58.760
I got the real mother fucking answers to your problems and at that time you're

949
00:54:58.770 --> 00:55:01.920
going,
I don't need your help bitch.
The Virgin Mary's in front of me.

950
00:55:01.921 --> 00:55:06.700
I got the answer,
motherfucker.
And I remembered that heroin trip hop,
I never,

951
00:55:06.750 --> 00:55:08.730
I cleaned up after that for about a month.

952
00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:13.710
It was so real and it was eight hours and that he stayed the Virgin Mary's Pussy

953
00:55:13.711 --> 00:55:17.070
was him as a child,
as a meat.
It was like me with a little afro and I was like,

954
00:55:19.260 --> 00:55:24.240
oh,
and I forgot that for 20 fucking years.
Look my balls,
the itching,

955
00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:26.400
you know what I'm saying?
That's how strong that fucking story.

956
00:55:26.430 --> 00:55:28.680
No wonder I always wanted to touch it.
Never fucking,

957
00:55:28.700 --> 00:55:31.230
and I didn't do it for years after that.
Like I was like,

958
00:55:31.231 --> 00:55:32.910
that's a little too fucking Straw.

959
00:55:33.150 --> 00:55:36.310
That's why when you guys talking about that DMT warm smile,

960
00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:39.830
that warmth is universal like that.
When you're there at that other level,

961
00:55:39.990 --> 00:55:43.380
it's just this and you're tripping.
You're waters,

962
00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:48.240
but something's telling you you will cry.
It's very loving.
I mean,

963
00:55:48.810 --> 00:55:51.300
people who have bad trips,
um,
you know,

964
00:55:51.301 --> 00:55:56.070
I don't know what your particular chemistry is,
but a lot of it,
I do believe,

965
00:55:56.071 --> 00:55:59.220
and this is,
you know,
I'm no expert clearly.
I do believe a lot of it,

966
00:55:59.221 --> 00:56:01.500
the shit that's fucking with them already and it's every dancing.

967
00:56:01.770 --> 00:56:05.970
It could be that no bad trip is basically somebody going to try to control their

968
00:56:05.971 --> 00:56:09.450
own budget with a bad trip is seeing yourself.
Oh,
okay.

969
00:56:09.780 --> 00:56:11.390
So all of this because when you're done the outcomes,

970
00:56:11.391 --> 00:56:14.370
some people do it a few times and they enjoy it and then they'll do it one time

971
00:56:14.371 --> 00:56:16.530
and have a bad trip because they seem themselves,

972
00:56:16.650 --> 00:56:20.280
but they do it the first couple of days because we did it in a circle.

973
00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:23.540
We didn't go home and the phone rang and you seen your face in a mirror of

974
00:56:23.541 --> 00:56:24.374
fucking melting.

975
00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:27.250
<v 2>That's what you felt and you felt warmth than you.</v>

976
00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:30.880
You sat down and all the sudden you feel like eating and your dog and also you

977
00:56:30.881 --> 00:56:33.700
start thinking of your childhood and where you went wrong and all the secrets

978
00:56:33.701 --> 00:56:37.000
that you have inside of you and now they were in front of you and you've got to

979
00:56:37.001 --> 00:56:41.770
deal with them.
That's your bad fucking trip.
That's your bad fucking trip.

980
00:56:41.771 --> 00:56:42.970
That is what it is.
It's really,

981
00:56:42.971 --> 00:56:46.570
you got a lot of fucked up shit in your own life that you,
you,
you,

982
00:56:46.650 --> 00:56:50.500
you don't appreciate getting illuminated and it's freaking you out.

983
00:56:50.860 --> 00:56:55.000
It's yourself.
It's when you trip.
That's,
I only say from my personal experiences,

984
00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:59.050
that's been my personal experience.
When I've had a bad trip.
It's always been a,

985
00:56:59.051 --> 00:57:01.330
and I haven't had anything that was really bad,

986
00:57:01.331 --> 00:57:03.550
but I've had some pot ones that were,

987
00:57:03.580 --> 00:57:08.110
I had a few pot moments when I first started smoking where I just got way too

988
00:57:08.111 --> 00:57:09.970
blast and then I just couldn't swim yet.

989
00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:14.020
I didn't know what I was doing yet and I was just getting overwhelmed by these

990
00:57:14.021 --> 00:57:18.430
waves because what would happen was,
um,
when,
when you,

991
00:57:18.431 --> 00:57:21.430
whenever you're in even a mild psychedelic like pot,

992
00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:24.580
what it does is it sort of brings you into some different place.

993
00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:27.400
And if you're trying to resist that in any way,

994
00:57:27.401 --> 00:57:30.640
if you're trying to fight that in any way or control it in any way,

995
00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:33.910
it's going to overwhelm you.
Especially if you take enough,

996
00:57:33.940 --> 00:57:36.070
if you take enough to get paranoid and freaked out.

997
00:57:36.071 --> 00:57:37.870
The reason why it's so effective,

998
00:57:37.871 --> 00:57:42.340
like you can learn so much from it is the same reason why it's so impactful when

999
00:57:42.341 --> 00:57:44.590
it happens while you,
while you can't control it,

1000
00:57:44.591 --> 00:57:48.760
it's just slipping away from you and you will get overwhelmed with these like

1001
00:57:48.761 --> 00:57:50.920
self realizations and it could have been,

1002
00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:55.030
it could be from shit from a decade ago man.
Absolutely.
It can be an old,

1003
00:57:55.240 --> 00:58:00.240
an old girlfriend where you said one crucial thing 1520 years ago and you feel

1004
00:58:01.031 --> 00:58:03.490
like a Douche bag today.
You know,

1005
00:58:03.491 --> 00:58:07.250
things that you said when you were 15 can haunt you.
I mean I've,

1006
00:58:07.251 --> 00:58:08.260
I've had that happen,

1007
00:58:08.890 --> 00:58:13.720
but I think that's all like to get you to look at yourself in a,
in a,

1008
00:58:14.110 --> 00:58:19.000
in a really honest way,
it's theirs.
It's very difficult for us to do.

1009
00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:22.840
I think most of us like to,
you know,
put our blinders on,

1010
00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:26.920
put our blinders on and just sort of stumble through this and make it look as

1011
00:58:26.921 --> 00:58:29.410
pretty as it possibly can along the way.

1012
00:58:29.411 --> 00:58:32.500
And pretend and pretend that we're doing everything correctly,

1013
00:58:32.710 --> 00:58:34.740
but to really like assess when,
you know,
it's,

1014
00:58:34.741 --> 00:58:38.140
it's almost like forcing yourself to go to school on yourself.
You know,

1015
00:58:38.141 --> 00:58:41.010
people don't want to do any more schoolwork than they already have to,
you know,

1016
00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:44.290
if I can get off work at five o'clock and I'm done for the day,

1017
00:58:44.291 --> 00:58:47.890
there's no more thinking done at,
there's yourself improvement,
suck my Dick,

1018
00:58:47.891 --> 00:58:51.700
I'm going to sleep,
you know?
Gimme my Ambien,
stop yelling at me.
You know?

1019
00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:55.510
And I think,
uh,
I think that's,
that's,
that's a part of it too.

1020
00:58:55.511 --> 00:58:56.500
I think people were,

1021
00:58:56.501 --> 00:59:00.580
a lot of people were just too tired to try to improve themselves.
You know,

1022
00:59:00.581 --> 00:59:01.520
it's funny that we owe,

1023
00:59:01.600 --> 00:59:03.880
you always talk about how you watch good and all that stuff.

1024
00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:08.590
If you really look into it,
you're a smart guy.

1025
00:59:08.591 --> 00:59:11.800
If you really look into the coca plant,
it started,

1026
00:59:11.801 --> 00:59:16.210
I was a mild hallucinogenic.
That kind of gave me a little bit of energy.
Yeah.

1027
00:59:16.211 --> 00:59:19.240
Well the,
the,
the people in high altitudes,
they chew the leaves,

1028
00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:23.060
the leaves and it's apparently it's healthy for you.
Eat all those guys.

1029
00:59:23.061 --> 00:59:26.000
I read some of those guys lived to 89 they work under the sun.

1030
00:59:26.001 --> 00:59:29.360
The altitude really high up there.
We,
it's us.

1031
00:59:29.790 --> 00:59:31.880
I'm destroyed this drug,
you know,

1032
00:59:31.881 --> 00:59:34.550
we put it into powder form and all this shit and what did they do?

1033
00:59:34.550 --> 00:59:35.211
How do they take it?

1034
00:59:35.211 --> 00:59:38.830
They take it out of the coca leaves and then they somehow or another hasn't
paid.

1035
00:59:38.860 --> 00:59:42.740
A white powder becomes a paste and then they put it on this fucking block.

1036
00:59:42.770 --> 00:59:47.660
I've never,
then you can't get that experience from the cocoa leaf.
Right?

1037
00:59:47.661 --> 00:59:51.020
You have to break it down to the White House.
I will tell you one charge.

1038
00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:55.310
I do know one thing I did blow with the eighties the late seventies and the blow

1039
00:59:55.311 --> 00:59:59.200
that some of the street,
now it's two complete different highs.
Yeah.

1040
00:59:59.210 --> 01:00:03.950
It was the 70s it was in the early eighties it was cocaine.
It wasn't processed.

1041
01:00:03.951 --> 01:00:07.280
There was no fillers though,
was no pink slime.
Right.
What I'm saying,

1042
01:00:07.281 --> 01:00:10.140
they was just made people feel great.
It was,
it was bro.

1043
01:00:10.141 --> 01:00:14.000
It didn't fucking make people lose their houses because it made them feel bad.

1044
01:00:14.270 --> 01:00:16.430
The problem with cocaine.
It was the marketing.

1045
01:00:16.850 --> 01:00:20.240
It wasn't cocaine that was so good.
It was the marketing.
We've discussed this.

1046
01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:21.860
The marketing was brilliant.

1047
01:00:21.890 --> 01:00:26.000
They gave it to people when a lot of money and musicians and athletes and they

1048
01:00:26.001 --> 01:00:31.001
gave people that we'll pour or mid 20 minutes of feeling important.

1049
01:00:32.570 --> 01:00:36.770
Oh my God,
these,
everybody was sniffing.

1050
01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:41.390
That's how a lot of athletes apparently get hooked after they stop,
stopped,
uh,

1051
01:00:41.790 --> 01:00:45.120
competing,
you know,
they miss a charge,
you know,

1052
01:00:45.121 --> 01:00:48.020
they missed something and then they'll start hanging around with people who

1053
01:00:48.021 --> 01:00:49.420
party and you know,

1054
01:00:49.460 --> 01:00:53.810
that's all a sudden now they're getting it out of a lot of boxers ended their

1055
01:00:53.811 --> 01:00:57.680
life that way.
Sonny Liston,
Sonny Liston ended his life that way.

1056
01:00:58.010 --> 01:01:02.030
A lot of guys did.
They,
uh,
they would just start doing drugs.
Uh,
Joe Lewis,

1057
01:01:02.031 --> 01:01:04.670
I'm pretty sure he started doing drugs.
The fucking spark is gone.

1058
01:01:04.671 --> 01:01:07.160
So you had official sparked and the artificial spark.

1059
01:01:07.161 --> 01:01:11.490
Isn't this good sugar Ray Leonard?
It's like Sylvia fucking sugar.
I mean,

1060
01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:15.130
there's a way out of problems putting on stockings and shit like that.

1061
01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:16.370
Do we get them coked up to,

1062
01:01:16.371 --> 01:01:20.690
I mean what I the trick when you're coked up to the gills.

1063
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.140
Yeah.
I mean my Dick,
but I didn't take no pictures.

1064
01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:27.850
Everybody was saying that Oscar de la Hoya,
he's gay and I'm like,
no,
ask Adele.

1065
01:01:27.860 --> 01:01:32.060
He does coke.
I forgot about it just because he's weird.

1066
01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:33.440
He's hanging out with girls,
man.

1067
01:01:33.441 --> 01:01:38.441
Do you understand who's hanging out with these stupid hot Russian strippers and

1068
01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:41.960
he's,
he's coked out of his mind wearing women's clothes.

1069
01:01:41.990 --> 01:01:45.230
You refuse to believe that he was married.
He might be,
but an unbelief.

1070
01:01:45.310 --> 01:01:48.210
Been married for 10 years.
He's been fucking with a sheet on for seven.

1071
01:01:48.590 --> 01:01:51.770
He goes to New York and some Russian chicks puts a fucking,

1072
01:01:51.790 --> 01:01:55.210
that's your noble talking to his ass hole.
That's your gold.
We'll talk.

1073
01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:58.640
Turns the fucking lights out on yet you'll be waiting on line for toilet paper.

1074
01:01:58.641 --> 01:02:00.580
You know what I'm saying?
He fucking went bananas.

1075
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:04.520
It just happens in our society.
And what are you going to do?

1076
01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:08.150
It's funny with Greg,
that night we were talking about what cocaine did,

1077
01:02:08.450 --> 01:02:11.300
you know would acid and pills.
Nobody wants that fucking house.

1078
01:02:11.301 --> 01:02:12.560
In the 70s you was hoping to join,

1079
01:02:12.561 --> 01:02:16.760
it was $2 all of a sudden cocaine came and people are losing their fucking
homes.

1080
01:02:16.761 --> 01:02:20.340
And so,
so you break it down.
The experience

1081
01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:23.550
<v 3>that you get from chewing the leaves,
you can't get that cocaine rush.</v>

1082
01:02:24.330 --> 01:02:27.150
You only get like a little mile buzz with chewing the leaves.

1083
01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:29.430
So the only way to get it into your bloodstream,

1084
01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:34.230
the way the cocaine was a massive dose dose.
I heard it's very good.

1085
01:02:34.231 --> 01:02:36.570
If you keep eating the fucking leaves,
you'll get high,
you know?

1086
01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:41.130
But you won't get high like coked up.
You have to eat like a whole salad.

1087
01:02:41.131 --> 01:02:42.750
You'll take the positive side of it.

1088
01:02:42.751 --> 01:02:46.640
I think you get like the euphoric without that fucking bullshit.

1089
01:02:46.650 --> 01:02:49.180
Just like a speed buds.
Yeah,
like that euphoria,

1090
01:02:51.990 --> 01:02:55.700
<v 4>not even unhealthy for you.
It's really bizarre that that becomes cocaine,</v>

1091
01:02:55.701 --> 01:02:58.250
which is like terrible for people I've sent,
you know,

1092
01:02:58.251 --> 01:03:01.790
we've all seen a lot of people have cocaine problems and it's a fucking

1093
01:03:01.791 --> 01:03:03.770
nightmare.
Yeah,
just terrible.

1094
01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:07.400
I had an ex girlfriend at a real real problem with it,
man.
She was scared.

1095
01:03:07.401 --> 01:03:10.220
She was scared that someone could bring it up at a party because she wouldn't be

1096
01:03:10.221 --> 01:03:12.950
able to say no,
they're the most annoying people.

1097
01:03:14.010 --> 01:03:17.940
It was when I first moved to La and,
uh,
the only thing I knew about,
uh,

1098
01:03:18.170 --> 01:03:20.630
cocaine was all negative from Boston.

1099
01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:25.820
And I had just gotten done being in the situation where I had to kind of get

1100
01:03:25.821 --> 01:03:30.270
away from a dude that I knew what it was selling it and he was dangerous and,

1101
01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:32.580
yeah.
Yeah.
And,
um,

1102
01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:36.110
so right when I came here and I started dating this chick and she was telling me

1103
01:03:36.111 --> 01:03:38.840
that she had this,
this cocaine thing,
like she,
she,

1104
01:03:38.841 --> 01:03:40.930
she liked it and she didn't like how much she liked it.

1105
01:03:40.930 --> 01:03:44.540
It made a really nervous and,
uh,
and I was like,
why?
And she's like,
well,

1106
01:03:44.541 --> 01:03:47.540
I could just see myself just completely fucking up my life for that stuff.

1107
01:03:47.930 --> 01:03:51.030
And I was like,
why didn't,
she was a very smart girl and she would,
uh,

1108
01:03:51.050 --> 01:03:51.950
if she would go to a party,

1109
01:03:51.951 --> 01:03:56.210
she said she would get scared if someone pulled it out.
She gets scared.
Hey Bro,

1110
01:03:56.270 --> 01:04:00.110
once some people get going to fucking go with apparently man,

1111
01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:05.000
especially girls,
I have a friend,
I don't,
I've never done coke.

1112
01:04:05.150 --> 01:04:05.900
Never.

1113
01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:09.200
But I have a friend who did it and started doing it just because the girls,

1114
01:04:09.630 --> 01:04:12.350
that's how he got into it because girls like it.
He said,
dude,
he goes,

1115
01:04:12.351 --> 01:04:15.590
girls would go crazy and when you do coke with him,
he goes,
they'd go crazy.

1116
01:04:16.850 --> 01:04:17.840
So that's why he started doing it.

1117
01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:23.860
<v 3>They don't like it.
They go fucking,
why is that?</v>

1118
01:04:23.890 --> 01:04:26.170
Why you going to?
And if you get the perfect pigeon,

1119
01:04:26.710 --> 01:04:30.070
like you get the perfect one that just gets crazy by four o'clock.

1120
01:04:30.490 --> 01:04:33.690
What you whip up that second grant you built with,
they're walking around naked.

1121
01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:38.170
They're playing with that pussy.
They put coke rocks,
but it's fucking crazy.

1122
01:04:38.171 --> 01:04:42.340
And you see this and you're like,
wow,
wow,
how they suck dick.
How different it is.

1123
01:04:42.341 --> 01:04:44.080
The blow job.
I take it into it.

1124
01:04:44.530 --> 01:04:48.370
Don't fucking stop in mid suck and give me a number line to get some energy and

1125
01:04:48.371 --> 01:04:50.820
they'll suck that pipe for another 20 but it's that whole night.

1126
01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:54.250
You ain't going to come.
So how long have they suck your Dick for?

1127
01:04:54.310 --> 01:04:58.720
40 minutes and then they drink a beer and eat a sandwich and they're back on

1128
01:04:58.721 --> 01:05:01.420
that helmet.
Another 40 minutes.
You want to fucking smart,

1129
01:05:01.421 --> 01:05:05.200
you got to suck this fucking pipe.
Nothing coming out either.

1130
01:05:05.201 --> 01:05:08.470
So you basically given them a a bike,

1131
01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:12.460
you're shooting a blank on them for and an hour and a half sour fucking blank.

1132
01:05:12.461 --> 01:05:16.210
But they do get at the end,
it doesn't even shoot how it just drips down.
Get big.

1133
01:05:16.211 --> 01:05:20.890
Like why is it about her that keeps you from coming?
I don't fuck it though.

1134
01:05:20.891 --> 01:05:24.760
It's the Mecca.
I been one of the mechanisms,
I remember when I got locked up,

1135
01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:27.070
you know what you're waiting on line to go to the doctor.

1136
01:05:27.071 --> 01:05:31.720
Like once you get to prison,
they had all these things on a billboard,
like,

1137
01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:35.320
you know,
uh,
be careful of hepatitis B,
Shit like that.

1138
01:05:35.590 --> 01:05:38.320
Then they had newspaper articles on Coke and they had,
you know,

1139
01:05:38.321 --> 01:05:42.280
what the fuck and 80s people were shooting cocaine to the deck after like two

1140
01:05:42.281 --> 01:05:46.180
days.
They go,
fuck it.
What can I do to enhance this shit?

1141
01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:50.530
I've already lit her on fire.
I killed one hooker.
I've come 80 times.

1142
01:05:50.531 --> 01:05:52.180
I got a big bag of blow laughs.

1143
01:05:53.110 --> 01:05:57.190
Oh shoot it at my dick directly and their legs would go fucking like they'd have

1144
01:05:57.191 --> 01:05:59.260
to get rushed to the hospital.
They lose a leg.

1145
01:05:59.650 --> 01:06:04.480
You know you have a heart before Viagra and whatever the 80s people that deep

1146
01:06:04.481 --> 01:06:08.410
mind,
we're thinking that if you fucking put coke rocks and get Dick,
trust me.

1147
01:06:08.411 --> 01:06:12.520
I was one of them.
If I want to take,
if I would've been able to take me those,

1148
01:06:12.540 --> 01:06:17.540
I would have shot coca my day a couple of nights and Taco fucking coke bitch

1149
01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:21.620
crazy once record on her pussy.
Lick that shit.
And you tell them,

1150
01:06:21.621 --> 01:06:25.140
you show them that coke alone or you put that,
sprinkle it on their wall.

1151
01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:29.790
They go fucking crazy.
You lick that fucking clear until its mouth becomes no.

1152
01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:34.170
Yes mom,
that you put some money,
put some of Your pee hole.
You put a look.

1153
01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:38.790
Well I'd be hotel at business.
Suck it out.
It's all over.
Oh yeah.

1154
01:06:38.890 --> 01:06:42.500
Coke Rock in your pee.
Oh fuck.
Like you load it up like a spit ball,
right?

1155
01:06:42.510 --> 01:06:45.280
Like a spit balled like a challenge and then they suck it.

1156
01:06:45.281 --> 01:06:47.770
But the wetness of gets old Boomi or shit like that.
Okay,

1157
01:06:47.771 --> 01:06:52.771
so what is it about doing coke that makes people just become crazy?

1158
01:06:53.070 --> 01:06:56.980
Just makes me little freaky and makes people just,
what is the feelings?

1159
01:06:56.981 --> 01:07:00.670
I've never experienced it.
I don't want to know what the original,

1160
01:07:00.671 --> 01:07:02.560
the middle or the last result.

1161
01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:05.980
Any of the above because we get the beginning.

1162
01:07:06.010 --> 01:07:07.990
It's like getting laid for the first time.

1163
01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:11.470
If somebody opens paying and then you like it or you don't like a foreigner
song,

1164
01:07:11.530 --> 01:07:15.970
but what happens is socially,
socially,
socially,

1165
01:07:15.971 --> 01:07:16.780
once you do it,

1166
01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:21.070
it lifts you lips here to a different level of people.

1167
01:07:21.070 --> 01:07:23.740
Like you think that's how it gets you.
It's like anything else.
Joe Rogan,

1168
01:07:23.950 --> 01:07:27.750
gambling.
How did you get to talk?
More or less?
Said Doc,
I want to lift.
I want,

1169
01:07:27.800 --> 01:07:31.690
I never had biceps.
Doc.
Okay,
I want to shop.
That helped me get bicep.

1170
01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:33.700
What do you mean you shoot a fucking shot?
Next thing you know,

1171
01:07:33.701 --> 01:07:35.710
you've got to dissect your shoulders.
Next thing you know,

1172
01:07:35.711 --> 01:07:38.650
you've got the doctors every week shooting fucking steroids.
How does it start?

1173
01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:42.280
It all starts with beautiful.
It's like a marriage.
You're going to honeymoon.

1174
01:07:42.281 --> 01:07:45.580
They suck.
Get thick honey,
honey.
After a year of Monday night football,

1175
01:07:45.581 --> 01:07:47.530
you don't want to talk to them no more.
It's just like anything else.

1176
01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:51.790
It's beautiful.
At the beginning you're meeting people.
Oh my God,

1177
01:07:51.791 --> 01:07:55.840
that's so interesting.
It's called Cup to having art parties and shit.

1178
01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:58.630
I love that man.
It becomes something different.

1179
01:07:58.631 --> 01:08:03.631
Then it becomes taking the package home with you because at first you go out,

1180
01:08:03.790 --> 01:08:07.120
me and Brian.
Brian,
you got 20 yeah,
let's split a 40 boom,
we go on,

1181
01:08:07.121 --> 01:08:10.360
but at the end of the night,
see you tomorrow.
Bye.
Then it becomes something else.

1182
01:08:10.361 --> 01:08:12.700
Brian,
what do you,
let's get another 40 and go back to your house.

1183
01:08:12.701 --> 01:08:14.980
Let's get another four,
you know?
Then we go back to his house.

1184
01:08:15.050 --> 01:08:19.430
We get another 40 then it becomes so nice.
Not you're missing work.
You know,

1185
01:08:19.431 --> 01:08:22.250
you maggot Cowan is fucking down.
Now you're on a roll.

1186
01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:26.210
You know now you hookup up with a check that's completely out of your character.

1187
01:08:26.211 --> 01:08:30.070
Why?
Because you give her a rocket coke.
She licks your ass hall.

1188
01:08:30.230 --> 01:08:32.620
She likes your ball sack on fire.
She does.

1189
01:08:33.050 --> 01:08:35.870
There's nothing even emotional button that Joe Rogan,
there's no real,

1190
01:08:35.871 --> 01:08:40.430
you don't even like this chicken that day time,
but when you're doing coach,

1191
01:08:40.431 --> 01:08:43.250
she's fun.
She'll talk to you,
you know whatever.

1192
01:08:43.670 --> 01:08:47.000
A lot of guys like just the fact that a girl will go degenerate with them.

1193
01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:49.610
I'm sure nobody wants to go dock street.

1194
01:08:49.611 --> 01:08:51.440
They always take somebody down on the streets.

1195
01:08:51.650 --> 01:08:55.340
Then it becomes something like after 20 years with me,
it becomes creepy.

1196
01:08:56.190 --> 01:08:57.800
It hears,
it becomes,

1197
01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:02.120
it becomes your underlying motive for forever wake up in the moment when the

1198
01:09:02.121 --> 01:09:05.840
morning you think of that joke you thinking of going to tend to see you
tomorrow,

1199
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:08.630
but I'm also thinking about how am I going to bring coke with me?

1200
01:09:08.631 --> 01:09:10.130
How much am I going to stay clean?

1201
01:09:10.131 --> 01:09:12.230
Am I going to get it tonight and double up for the week?

1202
01:09:12.231 --> 01:09:13.760
I just get really fucked up tonight.

1203
01:09:13.761 --> 01:09:17.630
That'll take me over till you start taking me over to when you say that,

1204
01:09:17.631 --> 01:09:18.650
like what?
What happened?

1205
01:09:18.651 --> 01:09:22.310
Like how many days could you go before you would get like a physical craving?

1206
01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:25.130
Three,
three days.
Those days.
Three.
Four.

1207
01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:29.570
I got a craving every night at 8:00 AM eight o'clock my fucking ears would go

1208
01:09:29.571 --> 01:09:32.360
numb.
Like Michael Corleone and the Godfather.
We shots a lot.

1209
01:09:32.361 --> 01:09:35.850
So you know what I'm saying is go numb and I couldn't,
but I was,

1210
01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:37.160
I was thinking about it,
the Ed that you know,

1211
01:09:37.161 --> 01:09:40.340
he used to run red lights until I got to the ATM machine.
What?

1212
01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:43.880
Even while I was taking the money out of the ATM machine.

1213
01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:46.340
How was it different person?
There was no logic.

1214
01:09:46.370 --> 01:09:50.000
It's like that joke you'd do about sitting in the back of the bus and the bus

1215
01:09:50.001 --> 01:09:54.770
drivers,
you Dick,
you know like I had no logic.
Even if God was right there,

1216
01:09:54.771 --> 01:09:59.630
Saint Joe,
you're 400 pounds,
you're going to die.
I had no logic that whole drive.

1217
01:09:59.631 --> 01:10:04.130
I had no logic to.
I would make the u turn on sunset.
No logic,

1218
01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:06.050
make a right on the brass,

1219
01:10:06.051 --> 01:10:10.170
shoot right over to Dante and get the package and I'm the drive.
I'd be cracked.

1220
01:10:10.171 --> 01:10:15.171
Now I'd stop for Red Lights now I got my focus back now I would because I needed

1221
01:10:15.291 --> 01:10:20.210
a red light to break it up,
so I would break it up right there,

1222
01:10:20.211 --> 01:10:21.100
right there when Rachel,

1223
01:10:21.710 --> 01:10:24.500
because it comes with a rock and I would pick it up and my hand in the Baggie.

1224
01:10:25.410 --> 01:10:29.540
So like you've put your fingers inside the mountain or on the outside of the

1225
01:10:29.541 --> 01:10:32.870
Baggie and breaking from the crush it crush it.
If it's,

1226
01:10:32.871 --> 01:10:35.650
if it's a rerock coke then it's hard.
Then it's a full Gacy.

1227
01:10:35.970 --> 01:10:38.990
You've got to get the hammer up,
but it's real coke.
It's soft.

1228
01:10:38.991 --> 01:10:42.930
It should break first fucking and then you just put a dollar building.

1229
01:10:43.210 --> 01:10:47.300
How you can tell he's good.
Yeah,
absolutely.

1230
01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:49.580
But it's really hard to get real coke.
Sure.

1231
01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:53.090
We caught it and they put speed in it and it was an amazing,
if you,

1232
01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:56.560
that's what deregulation is,
ladies and gentlemen.
When when needed,

1233
01:10:56.561 --> 01:10:58.730
we don't regulate something and you make it illegal.

1234
01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:03.020
Then a bunch of different people allowed to cut it up and do whatever the fuck

1235
01:11:03.021 --> 01:11:05.900
they want to do with it and call it [inaudible] accident.
You couldn't do this.

1236
01:11:05.901 --> 01:11:10.030
It would all be completely illegal if it was being sold at cvs.
You know,

1237
01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:12.890
if you could set up by it at the liquor store,
if I could just buy a leaf.

1238
01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:15.060
I wonder if like regular cocaine,

1239
01:11:15.180 --> 01:11:18.330
how bad his regular cocaine for you without all the shit.

1240
01:11:18.331 --> 01:11:21.480
Is it just as addictive?
Target's kind of be like anything else.

1241
01:11:21.481 --> 01:11:24.540
Chinese food is good for you one time every two weeks,

1242
01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:28.070
but if you do regular full gang can be good for him.
I'm sure that if,

1243
01:11:28.230 --> 01:11:30.210
I'm sure if this society,

1244
01:11:30.750 --> 01:11:35.350
there's a coke feed scientist somewhere that could find one positive effect of

1245
01:11:36.450 --> 01:11:39.870
you and I both thought I pay one positive effect that has for me while I was

1246
01:11:39.871 --> 01:11:43.260
doing it.
I wasn't a no more really,
it's amazing.

1247
01:11:43.261 --> 01:11:46.170
You focus on fucking shadows.
I was good at math.

1248
01:11:46.590 --> 01:11:50.130
I would love to do math equations when I was coked up really at my fuck.

1249
01:11:50.131 --> 01:11:52.720
You know,
I'm not a mind fuck or you know,
you have to be and go,
what a fan.

1250
01:11:52.721 --> 01:11:55.440
This is Silva for Muhammad Ali.
Go Fuck your mother.

1251
01:11:55.441 --> 01:11:59.140
I ain't got time to puzzle out.
I got more important things like a joker,

1252
01:11:59.160 --> 01:12:03.150
you know,
but mine fuck yourself.
Like what if I went on the road every week,

1253
01:12:03.830 --> 01:12:08.180
make 10 grand and sole 300 tee shirts.
I would do shit like that.
Like an,

1254
01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:12.210
you know like shit like that.
Like a do math like that for hours.

1255
01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:16.800
Like it's got nothing to do with me but I was get so analytical you'd get so

1256
01:12:16.801 --> 01:12:19.980
analytical.
I think about shit,
but I was thinking about and break it down.

1257
01:12:20.260 --> 01:12:23.040
The same thing that you do with acid you can do with mushrooms.

1258
01:12:23.570 --> 01:12:25.470
You know when you,
when you take a mushroom,

1259
01:12:26.010 --> 01:12:28.080
if you're a normal fucking individual,

1260
01:12:28.290 --> 01:12:32.390
if you have some type of pain going on in your heart right now after an hour and

1261
01:12:32.391 --> 01:12:35.940
giggling and joking around that page and start to come up because it's forcing

1262
01:12:35.941 --> 01:12:40.560
you to deal with it.
That's where the bad trip comes in.
And it's the same thing.

1263
01:12:40.561 --> 01:12:44.190
Probably happens for coke.
It happens for heroin.
I mean dog everything.
You know,

1264
01:12:44.191 --> 01:12:48.000
if I do two squatch twice a week,
that's great for you.

1265
01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:51.240
If I do it six times a week with 400 pounds,
I'm a fuck something up.

1266
01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:54.830
Eventually everything.
Joe Rogan,
you know,
does the,

1267
01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:58.470
but the coke experience is very different than the Coke Cup would speed

1268
01:12:58.471 --> 01:12:59.340
experience.
Right.

1269
01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:04.080
Coke experience I had in the 80s and the coke experience I had five years ago is

1270
01:13:04.081 --> 01:13:06.210
two different things.
When did it,

1271
01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:11.600
I mean there's no way to tell like until you do it any way.

1272
01:13:12.330 --> 01:13:15.630
I think the cold chains in mid 80 [inaudible] when they figured out that the

1273
01:13:15.631 --> 01:13:18.090
speed aspect of it,
we'd get you addicted.

1274
01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:22.950
Well they figured out the cause.
So you get addicted to the speed.

1275
01:13:22.951 --> 01:13:27.180
You're not even getting into the tokens much gives you wings.
Whoa.

1276
01:13:27.210 --> 01:13:31.680
That is crazy.
Once they started throwing the speed and the accelerants in there,

1277
01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:33.970
you know,
crack is he coke was,

1278
01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:36.650
coke was a loser for a while because they couldn't smoke.

1279
01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:39.480
The Bush administration couldn't.
Bush.

1280
01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:43.230
They weren't letting an ether into the,
that was the biggest problem.

1281
01:13:43.230 --> 01:13:46.080
It wasn't getting,
we've had this discussion.
Yeah,
yeah.
You couldn't get it out.

1282
01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:46.973
So they,
they,

1283
01:13:47.160 --> 01:13:51.240
they started washing it with gasoline so that coke had a horrible smell to it.

1284
01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:55.140
Like you do a line and go,
Jesus Christ.
Like some of it was like,

1285
01:13:55.141 --> 01:13:58.410
I remember one time I went and bought a bad buy.
I bought nine ounces.

1286
01:13:58.620 --> 01:14:00.930
The coke was tremendous,
but it smells like cat piss.

1287
01:14:01.100 --> 01:14:04.950
And I would sell it at bargain prices and people would still come back.
Like,

1288
01:14:04.951 --> 01:14:08.880
Joey,
I love you,
but this is brutal dog.
This is pure cat,

1289
01:14:09.710 --> 01:14:13.840
your campus.
I ended up snowing the whole thing and that like,
so I burned holes.

1290
01:14:13.841 --> 01:14:14.530
I've been here.

1291
01:14:14.530 --> 01:14:16.990
You don't have football players put those black marks or their eyes.

1292
01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:20.800
I had to big takes at the here from the fucking whatever was coming out was just

1293
01:14:20.801 --> 01:14:24.910
burning my fucking skin.
Oh my fucking,
it was free.
I had already paid for it.

1294
01:14:25.090 --> 01:14:26.440
I didn't know that you,
you know what?

1295
01:14:26.470 --> 01:14:30.850
A lot of cocaine became a no loser because of the coke was good.

1296
01:14:30.851 --> 01:14:34.690
You sold it at high prices and if it tastes like a monkey's ass,

1297
01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:36.960
then you turning it into crack and a bird,

1298
01:14:36.970 --> 01:14:41.080
all the residue and it gave you back the pure cocaine.
That's crazy.

1299
01:14:41.081 --> 01:14:44.800
What a w who the fuck figured that out?
That two black guys in Harlem.

1300
01:14:44.910 --> 01:14:49.480
So you follow up saying this is what our conversation,
you know?
No,
no black guy.

1301
01:14:49.481 --> 01:14:52.720
Brian,
no black guy or no fucking coke fiends.
And we call them and go,

1302
01:14:52.721 --> 01:14:55.420
listen Brian,
we've got 40 hours worth of coke.

1303
01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:57.190
I'm sick and tired of the snow on it.

1304
01:14:57.250 --> 01:15:02.250
What if we put it in a glass and we put baking soda and we put it in a microwave

1305
01:15:02.891 --> 01:15:06.940
oven and cook it up and in 20 seconds,
what does that bell goes?
B,
we take it out,

1306
01:15:06.941 --> 01:15:07.774
we smoke it.

1307
01:15:08.350 --> 01:15:13.330
Two white guys on COPD in the event that the them creating crack,

1308
01:15:13.420 --> 01:15:14.530
what is it?
Why is the,

1309
01:15:14.531 --> 01:15:18.430
what does the baking soda I have to do with anything because it cleans baking

1310
01:15:18.431 --> 01:15:21.120
soda.
Like when you put in your refrigerator,
you could put it in do,

1311
01:15:21.121 --> 01:15:24.750
she's fucking,
you could brush your fucking teeth when it beat it.

1312
01:15:24.760 --> 01:15:28.570
Beat got bought out or become whatever's in there.
It neutralizes,

1313
01:15:28.571 --> 01:15:31.960
it burns away all the waste.
So all the shit they put in there,

1314
01:15:31.961 --> 01:15:35.860
like if you put a gram of cocaine and you get after you take it out way that

1315
01:15:35.861 --> 01:15:39.670
motherfucker again,
you get six tenths.
Now is that crack or is that free base?

1316
01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:41.470
That's like a free base.
But you could take that,

1317
01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.030
that thing and put it into cigarettes.

1318
01:15:43.270 --> 01:15:45.760
A lot of Colombians would just take the front of the cigarettes out in,

1319
01:15:45.770 --> 01:15:46.930
pop those in the clubs.

1320
01:15:47.230 --> 01:15:50.590
And you'd think that smoking a cigarette that's smoking pure fucking bazooka

1321
01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:55.240
isn't,
I'm saying things.
So that takes a killing the cancer.
Wow.

1322
01:15:55.840 --> 01:16:00.010
So what is the difference then between crack and freebase?
What does it,

1323
01:16:00.250 --> 01:16:05.230
how does they did something with craft to multiply it even more to make it more

1324
01:16:05.231 --> 01:16:07.930
addictive?
No,
no.
It can make it more to make more,

1325
01:16:09.240 --> 01:16:11.020
make more money from it.
It was really cheap.
Yeah.

1326
01:16:11.021 --> 01:16:13.780
Because I can understand that cocaine was,

1327
01:16:14.490 --> 01:16:16.410
I thought that's what it was in that spirit and I'm like,
no,

1328
01:16:16.420 --> 01:16:17.740
that's the shit together.
Shit,

1329
01:16:17.741 --> 01:16:22.270
the shit they do basically they put it up in a paint thing with thinner and you

1330
01:16:22.271 --> 01:16:26.530
know like let's say,
I don't even know what,
what you got 28 grams in an ounce,

1331
01:16:26.531 --> 01:16:29.080
so 16 ounces times 28 whatever that is.

1332
01:16:29.470 --> 01:16:34.470
A regular coke or a regular person would throw a 10 on 28 so you would throw 16

1333
01:16:35.231 --> 01:16:37.570
times 10 160 grams a cut on it or something.

1334
01:16:37.571 --> 01:16:39.550
This is what I'm just assuming we're crack.

1335
01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:41.800
You could probably throw grand for grant,

1336
01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:47.640
so I could probably get whatever the result is with 28 times 16 and add it and

1337
01:16:48.011 --> 01:16:51.460
neutralize it.
The 50% and I'll get,
you know,
with heroin,

1338
01:16:51.490 --> 01:16:54.150
what happened with the mob d do nothing to hit everybody.

1339
01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:57.220
So Bob [inaudible] fucking morons.

1340
01:16:57.250 --> 01:17:02.250
They just figured out how to take heroin and pay 50,000 and get a 400,000 back

1341
01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:06.520
from it to magic that I,

1342
01:17:06.521 --> 01:17:10.010
if I figured out how to give you 50 grand every and on Friday,

1343
01:17:10.010 --> 01:17:13.370
<v 2>I picked up 400,000.
Wow.
How are they doing that?</v>

1344
01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:14.960
Because they would take an hour with it,

1345
01:17:14.961 --> 01:17:17.750
cutting it to knock to do you seem like an American gangster?

1346
01:17:17.751 --> 01:17:20.750
The cops are taking the heroin,
cutting it and selling it back to the mob.

1347
01:17:21.010 --> 01:17:24.830
The mob was cutting itself.
This is fucking craziness.

1348
01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:29.900
This is the Alex Jones talks about,
they were just taking heroin even at 40%.

1349
01:17:29.901 --> 01:17:30.651
Oh fuck your world.

1350
01:17:30.651 --> 01:17:34.700
Doesn't it amazing when you find out how many cops actually have sold drugs and

1351
01:17:34.701 --> 01:17:35.440
being caught by it?

1352
01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:39.980
Remember the cocaine cowboys with the whole entire one entire graduating class

1353
01:17:39.981 --> 01:17:43.800
of the Miami Police Department,
the uh,
the whatever it is,
the,
uh,
what's the,

1354
01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:49.070
not the,
um,
what is it?
The training of the school?
Yeah.
Police Academy.

1355
01:17:49.370 --> 01:17:54.200
100.
100% of them either were murdered or wound up being incarcerated for being

1356
01:17:54.201 --> 01:17:56.000
corrupt.
While she put your sentiment,

1357
01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:59.450
but what happened at that time was Miami got a gun put to the head like any

1358
01:17:59.451 --> 01:18:02.920
other,
any other community spics moving Latino's wherever you were.

1359
01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:05.870
Cubans were everywhere in 1979 you know,

1360
01:18:05.871 --> 01:18:10.871
Fidel said fucking 98 boats filled with Cubans and maybe four of them stayed in

1361
01:18:10.971 --> 01:18:15.260
Miami.
How much it was cocaine responsible for what Miami became,

1362
01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:18.700
Oh my God,
it was built on it.
This is Copeland's.
Grover.

1363
01:18:18.710 --> 01:18:22.760
I'm going to had an investigative were bill Curtis coconut grow was a place

1364
01:18:22.761 --> 01:18:27.620
where pirates used to hang on the 1700 great story where I'm going and that

1365
01:18:27.621 --> 01:18:29.390
whole city is built on cocaine.

1366
01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:32.990
I know construction who lived down there for a while and he told me,

1367
01:18:32.991 --> 01:18:34.520
I don't know if this is a verifiable fact,

1368
01:18:34.521 --> 01:18:39.230
but there's more banks per capita in Miami than any other city in the country.

1369
01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:44.480
It makes sense.
[inaudible]
money and bringing in cocaine.

1370
01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:47.450
So in the 80s would that thing when I with those cops,

1371
01:18:47.630 --> 01:18:49.790
the city got to go put their their head.
They're like,
Bro,

1372
01:18:49.791 --> 01:18:52.550
you got all these Latinos and you got to know Latins on the police force.

1373
01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:56.290
You've got to put more cops or the police force in a hurry.
Jesus,

1374
01:18:56.300 --> 01:19:00.440
before it gets out of hand.
So they even do background checks.
Oh my God.

1375
01:19:00.590 --> 01:19:03.340
They sealed all that Juvi records and they hide all these cops.

1376
01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:05.070
They had full cops,
right?
Wake up.

1377
01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:08.270
That would just pull you over taking your drugs with drawing you into the river.

1378
01:19:08.271 --> 01:19:10.550
That's what they call the river cops.
There are cops.

1379
01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:14.960
I remember being Joe in coconut grove the week one of them got let out of jail.

1380
01:19:14.970 --> 01:19:18.920
He got a job as a cook and the whole community signed petitions to not,

1381
01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:23.390
it was at a cafe called Mambo down there not to be hired and the community

1382
01:19:23.391 --> 01:19:25.640
because he killed them.
What your fucking people.
I mean,

1383
01:19:25.641 --> 01:19:28.700
they weren't like killing people because they did something wrong to them.

1384
01:19:28.701 --> 01:19:31.460
They would just pull you over shooting you and throwing you into the fucking

1385
01:19:31.461 --> 01:19:34.790
river.
How did he get out of jail?
How that policy did that time?
Whoa,

1386
01:19:35.090 --> 01:19:38.810
that's silly.
Murderer.
They got arrested.

1387
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:42.260
They got arrested in 85 and they were walking the streets and how many people

1388
01:19:42.261 --> 01:19:44.210
did they killed though?
Then you should be dead.
I don't know.

1389
01:19:44.211 --> 01:19:46.310
You've got to look to tell a bunch of people.
You're dead.

1390
01:19:46.311 --> 01:19:50.060
You don't get out of jail.
That's ridiculous.
That's nonsense.

1391
01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:52.970
I'm liberal about a lot of shit.
I'm liberal,
black,
gay marriage,

1392
01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.610
but about that you can suck my dick.
That guy needs to be done.

1393
01:19:56.240 --> 01:19:59.540
The system has loopholes.
You know reality.

1394
01:19:59.541 --> 01:20:03.530
Let's say he did 14 fucking years.
It's like that's what it is.

1395
01:20:03.531 --> 01:20:05.960
They gave him a 30 year fucking sentence or a 20 year sentence.

1396
01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:09.330
They give you a 20th since you'd do 10 and then you all in front of the parole

1397
01:20:09.331 --> 01:20:09.631
board.

1398
01:20:09.631 --> 01:20:12.720
The Parole Board votes on you to get out in the street or done in a violent

1399
01:20:12.721 --> 01:20:15.150
offense.
If that's true,
why is the Manson released?

1400
01:20:15.420 --> 01:20:17.460
Because who the fuck is my release?

1401
01:20:18.150 --> 01:20:21.630
This guy goes in front of the parole board and we actually offer a Nazi thing on

1402
01:20:21.631 --> 01:20:24.270
his forehead.
Where are you going to?
Who's going to hire?
That's fucking guy.

1403
01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:25.830
Who's going to hire him?
What?

1404
01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:30.930
What social security benefit that z fucking have that guy.
Yeah,
he was awesome.

1405
01:20:30.990 --> 01:20:35.070
What?
What are you gonna do?
I am your Jesus.
He made me man,

1406
01:20:35.670 --> 01:20:39.930
has it off your garbage and leave it in your streets,
man.

1407
01:20:40.650 --> 01:20:42.880
Who's a spooky,
that's a good guy to be a sales,

1408
01:20:42.890 --> 01:20:46.830
but all those bitches at the shoot shoot.
Oh by the way,

1409
01:20:46.831 --> 01:20:48.780
people don't even realize that he didn't kill anybody.

1410
01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:50.160
He might've killed one guy,

1411
01:20:50.370 --> 01:20:55.020
but almost everybody in that whole organization was killed by that Tex Watson

1412
01:20:55.020 --> 01:20:59.250
Guy who went on to yeah.
And the squeaky Fromme who tried to kill president.

1413
01:20:59.251 --> 01:21:00.084
Forward word.

1414
01:21:00.110 --> 01:21:04.280
I had a dog named squeaky Fromme who wound up killing one of my other dogs.

1415
01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:07.900
Oh yes.
Wiki.
Yeah.
That crazy bitch.
That last name.

1416
01:21:07.901 --> 01:21:11.630
I screen crazy dogs.
Yeah.

1417
01:21:11.690 --> 01:21:14.840
That whole Manson thing was a trip because he didn't even really kill anybody.

1418
01:21:14.841 --> 01:21:15.650
Man.

1419
01:21:15.650 --> 01:21:19.730
Those those other people killed people for when I text Watson Guy and that Tex

1420
01:21:19.730 --> 01:21:23.270
Watson guy became like a serious born again Christian while he's in the hole,

1421
01:21:23.390 --> 01:21:24.223
you know,

1422
01:21:24.230 --> 01:21:29.230
it's probably the only way he could ever rationalize his situation and where

1423
01:21:29.721 --> 01:21:32.390
he's going.
I mean,
what he did murder those people.

1424
01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:35.240
They cut a baby out of a woman's body.
You know,

1425
01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:40.090
that's what made supposedly made Roman Polanski crazy.
That was his wife or his,

1426
01:21:40.091 --> 01:21:45.050
uh,
his girl,
I dunno if it were married,
I think it was his wife,
but she had,
uh,

1427
01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:49.340
his,
his baby inside of her and the fucking Manson fan that came and cut her out.

1428
01:21:49.550 --> 01:21:52.280
I mean,
it's really,
it's a really sick shit man.
It's,

1429
01:21:52.340 --> 01:21:54.950
the whole thing is really sick.
I mean,
they wrote,

1430
01:21:55.040 --> 01:21:59.300
wrote shit on the walls and stuff and you know,
it's like really,
it's,

1431
01:21:59.310 --> 01:22:00.230
it's a scary,

1432
01:22:00.590 --> 01:22:05.590
scary dark proposition that some little crazy psychopath was able to talk these

1433
01:22:06.561 --> 01:22:10.760
people and to just committing just horrible murders for him.

1434
01:22:10.761 --> 01:22:11.750
Some sick fuck.

1435
01:22:12.020 --> 01:22:15.350
Figured out a way to control these people and get all these lost people together

1436
01:22:15.351 --> 01:22:18.860
and just unleashed them,
you know?
And they were all family.

1437
01:22:19.340 --> 01:22:24.140
Like what a crazy fucking thing that must've been mad.
Could you imagine?

1438
01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:27.230
First of all,
Charles Manson could never existed without,
with Google.

1439
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:30.380
That shit will never work because he would have been talking crazy shit.

1440
01:22:30.381 --> 01:22:32.270
And girls who have been pulling out their phones going,
wait a minute.
No,

1441
01:22:32.271 --> 01:22:33.830
that's not true.
You know,

1442
01:22:33.831 --> 01:22:37.040
this is how it's done to the government set up this way.
The North,

1443
01:22:37.050 --> 01:22:40.670
the congress controls this,
but back then he could say anything.
You know,

1444
01:22:40.671 --> 01:22:43.550
he was just a charismatic guy and they were looking for guidance.

1445
01:22:43.820 --> 01:22:47.390
Next thing you know,
Charlie Manson's to fucking daddy of the family.

1446
01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:52.250
You know what?
It's weird,
crazy little wild.

1447
01:22:52.251 --> 01:22:56.480
Ex Con is the,
the leader of this group of fucking psychopaths.

1448
01:22:56.481 --> 01:22:59.870
They're running around cutting people up and that sort of symbolized for a lot

1449
01:22:59.871 --> 01:23:04.130
of people what was wrong with the sixties that's it symbolized for a lot of

1450
01:23:04.131 --> 01:23:08.680
people what was wrong with the drug culture and the hippies that there was

1451
01:23:09.340 --> 01:23:12.040
amongst them,
there were,
they weren't all altruistic.

1452
01:23:12.041 --> 01:23:14.950
There's a lot of hippies that were just fucking crazy and drug use had to be

1453
01:23:14.951 --> 01:23:16.570
stopped because some people just couldn't take it.

1454
01:23:16.750 --> 01:23:19.470
Look at the manse of family and that was like a good,
you know,

1455
01:23:19.490 --> 01:23:21.700
reason for justification like that though.

1456
01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:25.720
Those that one group of fucking crazy assholes ruined it for a lot of people

1457
01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:30.820
talk,
but you can't blame it all on drugs now.
He can't.
It was a bunch of kids.

1458
01:23:30.850 --> 01:23:32.880
It's like we sit here every week and you know,

1459
01:23:33.010 --> 01:23:36.280
how do people get caught up in a cult?
How do people

1460
01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:39.790
get brought up in gangs?

1461
01:23:40.490 --> 01:23:43.780
My friend's parents were in Mexico going to school at White,

1462
01:23:43.781 --> 01:23:47.770
couple from Michigan,
educated good families,
went to Mexico,

1463
01:23:47.771 --> 01:23:52.150
got talked into moving to Pennsylvania and moving into a cult and they started

1464
01:23:52.151 --> 01:23:56.170
having kids with the Kalita.
Oh,
the guy who started fucking the wife.
Oh,

1465
01:23:56.171 --> 01:23:59.960
when does it hold?
Do you have in your soul when your,
your,

1466
01:23:59.970 --> 01:24:03.970
your DNA that you allow that into you and that's any cult,

1467
01:24:03.971 --> 01:24:07.510
whether it's Jim Jones,
whether it took religious sector,

1468
01:24:07.660 --> 01:24:09.970
we're all looking for a hole to fill.
Well,

1469
01:24:09.971 --> 01:24:14.770
I got fucking hole that they had to go kill fucking people at night because some

1470
01:24:14.771 --> 01:24:15.820
guy sent them,
I mean,

1471
01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.480
it's a bunch of people that were confused that ran into a fucking salesman.

1472
01:24:19.900 --> 01:24:23.410
When people run into a salesman,
it's a bad fucking day fee.

1473
01:24:23.770 --> 01:24:27.730
They ran into a soundbite again,
the guy might have killed one fucking person.

1474
01:24:27.970 --> 01:24:29.770
I kill it.
No pill is Joe Rogan.

1475
01:24:29.771 --> 01:24:32.290
I see him stab somebody first and give me the knife.

1476
01:24:32.291 --> 01:24:35.440
I'm stabbed cause we're all going down here and you're going to send me to go I

1477
01:24:35.441 --> 01:24:39.160
some fucking guy because the Lord said,
you know Dave Koresh,

1478
01:24:39.430 --> 01:24:42.850
you know these people fill a void.
Joe Rogan.
Yeah,
it's not the drugs.

1479
01:24:43.030 --> 01:24:47.120
The drugs accelerates the fucking weakness to a point because they'll confuse,

1480
01:24:47.170 --> 01:24:49.060
now they're fucking confused.

1481
01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:51.850
Even though I was essentially in a cult because I was in,

1482
01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:55.270
when you're doing martial arts,
it's positive cult when,

1483
01:24:55.271 --> 01:24:58.180
but you get involved in something like taekwondo.

1484
01:24:58.450 --> 01:25:01.420
One of the great things about it is it teaches you discipline and respect for

1485
01:25:01.421 --> 01:25:03.760
your higher ranks and all this stuff.

1486
01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:07.900
But in reality it's just weird.
It's like this.

1487
01:25:08.100 --> 01:25:12.820
I mean it's all this really controlled environment where you,
you know,
the,

1488
01:25:12.821 --> 01:25:17.320
the masters there and Oh mastercam and you have to bow to the master.

1489
01:25:17.321 --> 01:25:18.670
And you know,
the younger students,

1490
01:25:18.671 --> 01:25:22.480
they bow to you and everyone's in line and everything is,
yes sir.
Yes sir.

1491
01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:26.410
I mean if you,
it's all positive and you learn a lot from,
don't get me wrong,

1492
01:25:26.411 --> 01:25:30.640
I mean it,
it greatly enhanced,
enhanced my life.

1493
01:25:30.641 --> 01:25:33.850
Martial arts completely changed who I am.
But when you looked at it,

1494
01:25:33.851 --> 01:25:37.990
there's a lot of culty shit to it.
You know,
it's not like Brazilian Jiu Jitsu,

1495
01:25:37.991 --> 01:25:39.110
the instructors,
they,

1496
01:25:39.170 --> 01:25:43.660
they get respect more just by rolling with people and explaining techniques and

1497
01:25:43.661 --> 01:25:46.480
by the reputation is that they don't have to go in and,

1498
01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:51.220
and everybody bow and everybody bows in class and lines up and turn.

1499
01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:52.990
It's ever very militaristic.
You know,

1500
01:25:53.050 --> 01:25:57.470
we would bow to the flag and bowed to the instructor and key eye and you know,

1501
01:25:57.471 --> 01:26:00.880
and everything would be,
everything would be done,
you know,

1502
01:26:01.060 --> 01:26:04.100
like this intensity and focus.

1503
01:26:04.150 --> 01:26:05.780
<v 4>Okay,
what do you want?</v>

1504
01:26:05.781 --> 01:26:08.540
And I just got to ask them so I won't keep talking about as something bro.

1505
01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:12.830
But you know,
jot,
it's very culty.
It's,
it's a good thing.

1506
01:26:12.920 --> 01:26:15.980
It was a great thing for me,
but it could be abused.

1507
01:26:16.010 --> 01:26:18.080
And I knew it was abused now with my school,

1508
01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:20.990
but I saw with other schools it was always,
there was always scandals.

1509
01:26:21.170 --> 01:26:25.880
Like an instructor was did something fucked up or one guy in the crowd,

1510
01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:28.100
we are talking about a fucking charger.

1511
01:26:28.101 --> 01:26:29.940
This guy's got every charging for what do you need?

1512
01:26:31.100 --> 01:26:35.400
That's why I was asking you why uh,
iPhone works.
No,

1513
01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:37.100
you kind of a thousand fucking,

1514
01:26:37.101 --> 01:26:42.101
why can't it go iPhone Simon resistance prints got the iPhone I three I liked

1515
01:26:43.191 --> 01:26:48.180
that.
I liked that.
Uh,
you look at it,
it's kind of cold is a called age,
you know,

1516
01:26:48.650 --> 01:26:51.290
it was a very positive call it,
but it's very positive.

1517
01:26:51.290 --> 01:26:54.260
But I was very lucky that the cult that I had,

1518
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:57.980
not only did they not take advantage of me and doing anything negative to me,

1519
01:26:57.981 --> 01:26:59.300
but in fact they enhanced me.

1520
01:26:59.301 --> 01:27:02.730
They taught me a lot of discipline and they gave me a job and they gave me like

1521
01:27:02.731 --> 01:27:06.470
construction free.
Like I trained at a place called the Jay,
Jay Hahn,

1522
01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:11.270
Tim Taekwondo Institute in Boston.
And so one of the best experiences of my life,

1523
01:27:11.690 --> 01:27:12.770
when I say it's a cult,

1524
01:27:12.800 --> 01:27:16.250
I in no way mean that anything negative happened to me because of it.

1525
01:27:16.251 --> 01:27:19.610
It was only positive but we were in a really good school.

1526
01:27:19.611 --> 01:27:22.220
We were like one of the best schools in the country we we saw and it was

1527
01:27:22.221 --> 01:27:23.990
everything was done the way it was supposed to be.

1528
01:27:24.230 --> 01:27:28.850
Everything was done with like real serious and he said it was a top class

1529
01:27:28.851 --> 01:27:31.760
taekwondo school but there was a lot of other karate schools and taekwondo

1530
01:27:31.761 --> 01:27:33.710
schools that were in the martial arts community.

1531
01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:37.700
We watched like big scandals happen and it was a lot of it was because people

1532
01:27:37.701 --> 01:27:40.820
would get into that position of power and they would start abusing it because

1533
01:27:40.821 --> 01:27:44.390
everybody treated their,
their seafood there,
sensei there,
whoever it was,

1534
01:27:44.420 --> 01:27:48.890
they treated them like they were a god and there was a lot of like sex scandals

1535
01:27:48.891 --> 01:27:52.160
would happen in martial arts schools.
It was like super common.
You know,

1536
01:27:52.161 --> 01:27:53.060
one guy got in trouble,

1537
01:27:53.061 --> 01:27:56.890
really famous guy got in trouble for having sex with some 17 year old girl and

1538
01:27:56.891 --> 01:27:59.150
it became like a big statutory rape thing.

1539
01:27:59.510 --> 01:28:02.810
It was like real common that people like it completely enamored by their

1540
01:28:02.811 --> 01:28:05.450
instructors.
It's one of the reasons why and a lot of those arts,

1541
01:28:05.620 --> 01:28:08.650
the instructors like wanted to keep everyone down and scan.

1542
01:28:08.670 --> 01:28:12.170
They had to be almost invincible in your eyes because otherwise you're moving up

1543
01:28:12.171 --> 01:28:14.810
the ladder and if you are you the top black belt in the school then in the

1544
01:28:14.811 --> 01:28:17.480
instructor is the only guy that it's left that you're really not really sparring

1545
01:28:17.481 --> 01:28:19.160
with.
You know,
how do you think you'd do with him?

1546
01:28:19.180 --> 01:28:22.190
He hasn't really sparked with anybody,
man,
what does this timing like even,

1547
01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:23.690
you know,
can I,
can I beat that guy?

1548
01:28:23.691 --> 01:28:27.050
And you start thinking those things you never think that way about your

1549
01:28:27.051 --> 01:28:31.460
instructor in,
in a proper school setting because the,
the,
the seniors and the,

1550
01:28:31.461 --> 01:28:35.210
the upper ranks in your instructor,
they become like,
they become a father figure.

1551
01:28:35.211 --> 01:28:39.590
They become like a,
you know,
a,
a king,
you know,
becomes like,

1552
01:28:39.591 --> 01:28:44.390
it's very important to give in to their,
you know,
their,
uh,
their order,

1553
01:28:44.510 --> 01:28:47.150
you know,
and he called him Sir all the time.
It's very culty,

1554
01:28:47.180 --> 01:28:48.260
but it's really good for you.

1555
01:28:48.710 --> 01:28:52.010
You know what this country does not remember you because you were young man.

1556
01:28:52.011 --> 01:28:55.970
I'm an old man.
I was alive before Bruce Lee died.

1557
01:28:57.020 --> 01:29:01.980
I was alive.
I was,
I was dressed.
When did he die?
[inaudible] 73 but I was part of

1558
01:29:01.980 --> 01:29:05.640
<v 3>that walking around with a cup full suit on and goal to Chinatown and burning</v>

1559
01:29:05.641 --> 01:29:08.820
incense in the house and eat rice with chopsticks.
And my mum was like,

1560
01:29:08.821 --> 01:29:12.780
are you fucking serious?
Are you fucking crazy?
And I remember when he died,

1561
01:29:13.170 --> 01:29:16.650
the sad,
like people couldn't believe it.
It was like John Lennon fucking die.

1562
01:29:16.890 --> 01:29:19.950
And what happened after that with martial arts?
You know,
when I was a kid,

1563
01:29:19.951 --> 01:29:23.970
I went to,
uh,
Lauren Joe's father realized your whatever.

1564
01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:27.990
And that was a score on 98th and west end that was always school for miles guy.

1565
01:29:28.230 --> 01:29:33.230
He's talking about [inaudible] and all of a sudden martial arts blew up like cut

1566
01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:36.680
karate schools and the 60s and this country will

1567
01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:40.290
then five fingers of death came out,

1568
01:29:40.590 --> 01:29:43.950
you know the Chinese connection until I drag and that were way before cause he

1569
01:29:43.951 --> 01:29:45.870
died rather the movie got released.

1570
01:29:46.050 --> 01:29:48.900
But a year before the enter the dragon came up.
You know,

1571
01:29:48.901 --> 01:29:52.380
black guys would lose their mind.
They will probably come full suits,
white guy,

1572
01:29:52.620 --> 01:29:56.670
everybody who had bruised elbows because everybody had new trucks.
You,

1573
01:29:56.671 --> 01:30:00.080
we've had bruises on the back of your fucking neck or because you know you'll

1574
01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:02.880
have to do,
we Corrado the Hong Kong cat came out,

1575
01:30:03.180 --> 01:30:07.380
he had new chucks and he would put copper tubes at the end for plumbing and

1576
01:30:07.381 --> 01:30:09.630
that's when people were really fucking starting to hurt themselves.

1577
01:30:09.900 --> 01:30:13.410
That was around 74 at the Bruce Lee died that everybody started taking out.

1578
01:30:13.411 --> 01:30:17.580
Bruce Lee stepped aside,
Bruce Lee and make way for Colorado,
the Hong Kong cat.

1579
01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:20.790
All that shit started,
but I was here in this country and what happened?

1580
01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:24.450
So people thought it was a fucking savior.
Like,
finally,

1581
01:30:24.451 --> 01:30:26.130
I didn't learn how to fight.
Finally,

1582
01:30:26.131 --> 01:30:29.730
I can learn confidence and let me tell you something.
It only becomes a cult.

1583
01:30:30.510 --> 01:30:33.210
When you walk out that door thinking you're invincible.

1584
01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:37.470
That's when it becomes a cult and you've seen it.
Those types of those schools,

1585
01:30:37.471 --> 01:30:41.160
and I see it happening to girls,
they get caught up.
Something bad happens.

1586
01:30:41.161 --> 01:30:44.400
They go in there and by the time they were purple belt,
they're like,

1587
01:30:44.401 --> 01:30:48.450
I could actually take a fucking guy.
Oh,
they get crazy and go,
well,

1588
01:30:48.451 --> 01:30:51.630
there's a lot of,
a lot of women,
I think,
especially in Jujitsu,
that purple belts,

1589
01:30:51.631 --> 01:30:54.240
it probably could take all that good so I can take you.
I'm not saying

1590
01:30:56.740 --> 01:30:59.400
it becomes a coat when I go out there and go,
you know what?

1591
01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:01.680
I'm going to go to a white castle at two in the morning.

1592
01:31:01.681 --> 01:31:05.160
I'm going to take out four mother fuckers.
That's when it becomes a cult.

1593
01:31:05.190 --> 01:31:08.790
I don't want you to ever think that your experience a little bit more than most

1594
01:31:08.791 --> 01:31:10.440
people would striking and stuff like that,

1595
01:31:10.860 --> 01:31:13.520
but I never want you to think it's really a Kung Fu move where you're going to

1596
01:31:13.530 --> 01:31:17.040
want to uh,
Steven Seagal shit people,
man.
People stab people.

1597
01:31:17.041 --> 01:31:20.410
You get hit with a chair and the head goodnight.
Ooh.
Oh no more.
I'm,
yeah,

1598
01:31:20.450 --> 01:31:23.310
he's a motherfucker.
Yeah,
he takes a stick out.

1599
01:31:23.311 --> 01:31:26.420
That's not what the class by the one,
by the way,
everybody's doing that.

1600
01:31:26.450 --> 01:31:30.150
90% of those things happen because someone's trying to prove something and if

1601
01:31:30.151 --> 01:31:33.660
you didn't,
if you just like assessed the situation and instead of thinking,
oh,

1602
01:31:33.661 --> 01:31:36.150
I'm going to prove this motherfucker,
man,
this motherfucker,
what's up?

1603
01:31:36.420 --> 01:31:40.640
Instead of doing that,
just think smart.
You just get out of there.
What if this,

1604
01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:44.340
if these were hyenas,
would you stay?
Now they're Schuman.
Hyenas get out of there.

1605
01:31:44.550 --> 01:31:46.560
You're in a situation.
Whenever you're in a situation,

1606
01:31:46.620 --> 01:31:50.100
if it can possibly be avoided that you don't fight,
don't fight.

1607
01:31:50.190 --> 01:31:53.460
The last thing I want to do is open up that door to negativity.
You know,

1608
01:31:53.461 --> 01:31:56.070
you beat someone physically,
first of all,
they beat you.

1609
01:31:56.071 --> 01:31:59.290
It's horrific and it you're at their mercy by though.
And that could happen

1610
01:32:02.270 --> 01:32:05.890
<v 2>with Maza Gotti and Joe,
whatever's gonna come out.</v>

1611
01:32:06.430 --> 01:32:11.370
Some people I've known a lot of thought they were absolutely,
Oh God,
Oh God,

1612
01:32:11.410 --> 01:32:13.900
they were absolutely invincible.
They did stand up to anybody.

1613
01:32:13.901 --> 01:32:14.830
Nobody could talk shit to them.

1614
01:32:14.831 --> 01:32:17.160
Then they get the fuck beat out of them one night,
you know,

1615
01:32:17.290 --> 01:32:18.970
you might fuck up and all of a sudden,
you know,

1616
01:32:18.980 --> 01:32:21.790
you get in a fight and you don't know that this kid is like a state champion

1617
01:32:21.791 --> 01:32:25.120
wrestler and he picks you up the air and dumps you on your fucking head on the

1618
01:32:25.121 --> 01:32:28.510
concrete and you're fucked up for a long time.
I mean,

1619
01:32:28.511 --> 01:32:30.880
guys can die from that shit.
He could punch you.
I mean,

1620
01:32:30.881 --> 01:32:32.470
who knows how merciful this guy is.

1621
01:32:32.471 --> 01:32:35.500
He might start punching your fucking face and while you're unconscious and you

1622
01:32:35.501 --> 01:32:36.161
can't do shit,

1623
01:32:36.161 --> 01:32:40.480
imagine that waken up to multiple concussions and your nose exploding on your

1624
01:32:40.481 --> 01:32:43.660
face and you're not even waking up.
He just just shocks of images.

1625
01:32:43.661 --> 01:32:47.620
Your body can even move cause this fucking gorilla is pounding your face into a

1626
01:32:47.621 --> 01:32:49.780
pancake.
That's all really possible,
man.

1627
01:32:49.810 --> 01:32:52.800
You know why you just see stupid fighting is stupid.
You know I used to see,

1628
01:32:52.820 --> 01:32:53.770
unless you want to do it for a living,

1629
01:32:53.780 --> 01:32:56.710
you know where he's to see a lot of people get knocked off the Jersey shore.

1630
01:32:57.040 --> 01:33:01.390
Oh yeah.
The Jersey shore.
I used to see,
watch the fights were those just sit.

1631
01:33:01.391 --> 01:33:06.310
There you
go.
That TV show or I wonder what it's like now.

1632
01:33:06.490 --> 01:33:09.820
But when we used to go down there and do Bob Gonzo gigs,
Holy Shit.

1633
01:33:09.821 --> 01:33:13.780
That place was wild.
Jersey shore is wild.
It's like a beach community.

1634
01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:18.280
But of all savages,
it's like 90% savages.

1635
01:33:18.330 --> 01:33:22.650
Spi side's fees.
I Paul,
when we walked in Ireland,
uh,

1636
01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:25.300
we have no idea Brian.
It's a fucking blast.

1637
01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:28.540
But now the wild oh beaches are packed.
Bumper to bumper,

1638
01:33:28.541 --> 01:33:31.100
you got people on top of you.
People put makeup on it.

1639
01:33:31.101 --> 01:33:33.610
It's like everybody's fucking kip could dash.

1640
01:33:33.611 --> 01:33:36.130
You have to go to the fucking beach.
Well they don't understand.

1641
01:33:36.131 --> 01:33:38.560
They see a show like Jersey shore and they are baffled.

1642
01:33:38.561 --> 01:33:41.800
They're baffled like how were these motherfuckers on TV and whatnot?

1643
01:33:41.830 --> 01:33:45.190
What the fuck is going on?
One more interesting guys.
So everybody's trying to,

1644
01:33:45.191 --> 01:33:48.910
you know,
find their angle in.
It's,
it's,
I mean,
and I don't blame them shit man.

1645
01:33:49.060 --> 01:33:52.600
If I lived there,
I'd probably be trying to do the exact same thing.
You know,

1646
01:33:52.601 --> 01:33:54.400
why not?
Shit.
You see these people,

1647
01:33:54.401 --> 01:33:56.290
all of a sudden they're making millions of dollars and they're essentially doing

1648
01:33:56.291 --> 01:34:00.850
the same shit you do and you've got to work a whole day.
That's preposterous.

1649
01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:04.420
You know,
to them it must be like mind boggling.
Smokey must blow all disease.

1650
01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:04.751
Must be,

1651
01:34:04.751 --> 01:34:09.490
it's a lot of hot bitches and Jersey that would just attack Snookie if they ever

1652
01:34:09.491 --> 01:34:12.790
saw her.
They like feel it,
that girl stealing from them,
you know,

1653
01:34:12.791 --> 01:34:15.220
like how is this fucking girl?
She thinks she's hot.
Oh my God,

1654
01:34:15.310 --> 01:34:18.470
she's fucking hot and now she's pregnant.
Who fucked her?
Who?
Fac Tech.

1655
01:34:20.170 --> 01:34:23.230
If they saw me,
if the fucking producers and met me for sure I'd be on that show.

1656
01:34:23.290 --> 01:34:28.180
What should I be on that show?
That fucking angry Jersey fucking squawky girl,

1657
01:34:28.620 --> 01:34:32.350
angry calling girl type.
Is that the most unattractive?

1658
01:34:32.530 --> 01:34:36.430
It's a combination between the angry Italian girl from Boston and the angry

1659
01:34:36.431 --> 01:34:39.460
Italian girl from Jersey that that's very specific.

1660
01:34:39.461 --> 01:34:42.880
Squawky sort of violence threatening

1661
01:34:45.850 --> 01:34:48.340
the Pisa has anybody that don't even look good.

1662
01:34:48.341 --> 01:34:51.730
There's a lot of complaining going on or Scada complaining.

1663
01:34:51.820 --> 01:34:55.120
Some girls even when you know,
it gets to the point where we're actually having,

1664
01:34:55.150 --> 01:34:59.180
you know like if,
if you,
if you tried to get to a relationship with them,

1665
01:34:59.181 --> 01:35:01.490
you start dating now,
go out with them a few times,

1666
01:35:01.491 --> 01:35:04.050
get closer cause girls or is this going to be this?

1667
01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:05.990
Like sometimes you got to wonder is this going to be worth it?

1668
01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:08.210
Like what's going on here?
Like someone before you,

1669
01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:10.400
before you actually have sex with them,
they're like holding it over you.

1670
01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:15.200
Like it's this reward that one day will take place if you do.
Exactly as I say.

1671
01:35:16.330 --> 01:35:19.370
And those girls would scare the shit out of me.

1672
01:35:19.400 --> 01:35:23.150
Like why are you so controlling and crazy bitch and we like each other or not.

1673
01:35:23.630 --> 01:35:27.350
Could you imagine this Jersey shore?
If we had to live in the middle of that,
me,

1674
01:35:27.351 --> 01:35:28.270
you and Joey Diaz,

1675
01:35:29.270 --> 01:35:32.720
a two bedroom apartment and we had to go in the middle of the legal work at the

1676
01:35:32.721 --> 01:35:36.890
nightclub that's next door.
All three of us had to do it for a year.
Wow.

1677
01:35:36.920 --> 01:35:40.950
What it would be an experiment we would call first death squad goes to the

1678
01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:44.870
Jersey shore.
I'll go crazy.
I might be able to teach them.
She was shit.

1679
01:35:45.230 --> 01:35:46.063
Those kids,

1680
01:35:46.390 --> 01:35:50.840
those kids are fucking crazy seminars with those kids all day.

1681
01:35:50.990 --> 01:35:52.640
They teach them about eating.
We'd,

1682
01:35:54.020 --> 01:35:58.970
it was for real bro.
Teach them about yoga earlier with the beat.
Those girls,

1683
01:35:58.971 --> 01:36:02.430
those guys eat.
Start to judge that you would start wearing Dan.

1684
01:36:02.431 --> 01:36:04.580
It's all the shoot.
They look twice a week.

1685
01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:08.370
They lift twice a week into legitimate,
amazing.

1686
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:11.390
Give him some free Jujitsu lessons.

1687
01:36:11.450 --> 01:36:14.420
Show him some shit about how the country really works.
Get them to eat.

1688
01:36:14.421 --> 01:36:16.550
We'd have you ever change them.
We can turn them around.

1689
01:36:16.610 --> 01:36:20.120
Have you ever worn a Bandana like on your head?
Like did like Bruce Springsteen?

1690
01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:24.170
Yeah,
I probably tried it once or twice.
It's a,

1691
01:36:24.171 --> 01:36:26.720
I think I tried it once at the gym cause a lot of dudes are wearing them at the

1692
01:36:26.721 --> 01:36:27.710
gym that's bringing it back.

1693
01:36:27.710 --> 01:36:31.070
But it's really stupid because it just slides off cause I'm expressive.

1694
01:36:31.071 --> 01:36:34.430
So I moved my a forehand a lot and it just slides up and then it falls off your

1695
01:36:34.431 --> 01:36:37.280
head.
We should make a stretchy band Nana.
That's like comfortable.

1696
01:36:37.730 --> 01:36:42.260
I've always had it accessories for guys though.
I like wallet chains,

1697
01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:46.030
chain
function.

1698
01:36:46.040 --> 01:36:49.370
Talking about like fucking people get dressed up to go to the gym or the beach

1699
01:36:49.371 --> 01:36:52.110
and they write the accessories like back at the fuck.

1700
01:36:53.090 --> 01:36:56.570
If I see it hot chicken in the hat and the pony tail is going through the day.

1701
01:36:56.780 --> 01:37:00.480
It's to plan.
Well we're east coast.
Anybody that tries too hard,

1702
01:37:00.481 --> 01:37:03.260
it was always a Douche bag and he guide shows up at the beach with a fucking

1703
01:37:03.261 --> 01:37:06.860
paradigm shoulder.
What are you doing asshole?
You know who are you?

1704
01:37:06.890 --> 01:37:09.350
You know guys walking through the park with a snake.

1705
01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:12.890
I don't mean this is my pet snake.
Whoa.
Can I touch it?
Who are you?

1706
01:37:12.891 --> 01:37:14.420
You fucking Weirdo.
You know what I mean?

1707
01:37:14.421 --> 01:37:17.570
Like when someone tried really hard to be eccentric,
it's always like,

1708
01:37:17.571 --> 01:37:21.140
can't they'll fuck with your cowboy hat?
You're from Pennsylvania.

1709
01:37:21.710 --> 01:37:22.710
They put glasses on.

1710
01:37:22.740 --> 01:37:26.390
I'll tell you what my pet peeves are with somebody who wears glasses to look

1711
01:37:26.391 --> 01:37:28.760
different.
Yeah.
How about glasses that are real?
Remember that?

1712
01:37:28.761 --> 01:37:30.020
That was a trend for a while.

1713
01:37:30.230 --> 01:37:33.890
They drive me crazy and people like that grow up all over sudden down.

1714
01:37:33.891 --> 01:37:34.910
They play golf.
Come here,

1715
01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:39.010
but I put my dick in your fucking nose study.

1716
01:37:39.430 --> 01:37:42.590
You want to go play fucking the golf?
It's supposed to be fun.

1717
01:37:42.620 --> 01:37:44.780
And what's wrong with that?
I just don't like you.

1718
01:37:44.781 --> 01:37:46.880
You off from where you're from what I'm saying?
Yeah,

1719
01:37:46.881 --> 01:37:51.260
but I know people from everywhere.
Play Golf.
No,
just do it.

1720
01:37:51.490 --> 01:37:56.400
Just to fit.
It is a weird thing how there's a lot of people that do that.

1721
01:37:56.460 --> 01:37:59.430
I've,
I've had a lot of people ask me if I play golf because they wanted to have

1722
01:37:59.431 --> 01:38:04.350
meetings with me on a golf course and I was like,
wow,
no,
nope.
None of that.

1723
01:38:04.380 --> 01:38:08.420
But he can't say,
can you play pool?
Cause no,
not in as many people play pool.

1724
01:38:08.440 --> 01:38:12.140
Not even though they look at you like fucking you're not part of our club.
Yeah,

1725
01:38:12.420 --> 01:38:16.920
I know.
You don't want to play in the skull and bones,
God your society.

1726
01:38:17.250 --> 01:38:20.550
You don't want to play a hundred bucks to walk around and fucking 18 get the

1727
01:38:20.551 --> 01:38:23.370
fuck out of here.
Walking around in the fucking park lot.
Hit a pigeon.

1728
01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:24.960
I know a place that's a golf course.

1729
01:38:24.961 --> 01:38:29.520
It's a country club and it cost a quarter million dollars to join just a quarter

1730
01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:32.430
million dollars just to join.
And then you have to pay yearly dues,

1731
01:38:32.580 --> 01:38:36.180
but just to get it and you have to give them a quarter of a million dollars for

1732
01:38:36.181 --> 01:38:40.350
the rights to use this stupid fucking told the judges just kind of chunk of
land.

1733
01:38:40.351 --> 01:38:43.980
But think about how to calm that is how many members must these motherfuckers

1734
01:38:43.981 --> 01:38:45.660
see you at the club on sub day?

1735
01:38:46.100 --> 01:38:49.500
So to keep anybody out that's not just stupid rich,

1736
01:38:49.950 --> 01:38:53.490
it's all just Maza Rodney's and Ferrari's and Porsche's.

1737
01:38:53.491 --> 01:38:55.680
And it's a weird place to drive by because you're like,

1738
01:38:55.681 --> 01:38:59.820
what a weird slice of the world right there.
That's a like an Uber.

1739
01:38:59.850 --> 01:39:03.470
Uber 1% they fucked themselves cause ludicrous joins to call it.

1740
01:39:04.170 --> 01:39:07.610
That's what it's all over.
But the shock because they say they all get together.

1741
01:39:07.630 --> 01:39:10.240
Go.
We don't know.
Charge them to live.
I don't know.

1742
01:39:10.260 --> 01:39:11.580
Raise the price to half a million.

1743
01:39:11.581 --> 01:39:13.800
That motherfucker shows up with three quarters of the mill.

1744
01:39:14.310 --> 01:39:15.900
There was a crazy baseball player.

1745
01:39:15.901 --> 01:39:18.030
Then I actually just got kicked out of Lake Sherwood,

1746
01:39:18.840 --> 01:39:23.840
some a athlete pro athlete was living there and that's another place that Lake

1747
01:39:23.870 --> 01:39:26.810
Sherwood Country Club is another one of those.
Let me find that in your head.

1748
01:39:27.750 --> 01:39:32.310
What's up?
B makes up 20 fucking charges.
You got to go try just for younger Joey,

1749
01:39:32.650 --> 01:39:36.180
you have like some stupid kind of phone man.
You gotta get up.

1750
01:39:36.330 --> 01:39:40.110
Get yourself an iPhone four g perfect uncle Joey.
I don't need a cab.

1751
01:39:40.130 --> 01:39:43.360
They don't even know what it is.
I don't want to fucking doc talk to nobody.

1752
01:39:43.361 --> 01:39:47.190
He was rocking that Forgy and been in and out.
It's beautiful.

1753
01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:50.850
I think he's a baseball player.
Hold on a second.
Dykstra,

1754
01:39:50.851 --> 01:39:55.080
what does is Lenny Dykstra?
No,
he's not.
That's the guy who's going to jump,
right?

1755
01:39:55.100 --> 01:39:59.000
Yeah.
What did he do?
He was like Robin cars or something.
What did the fucking,

1756
01:39:59.010 --> 01:40:02.070
do you know what happened to have grown mental illness?
Really?
He,

1757
01:40:02.071 --> 01:40:05.340
I think he's crazy.
You see that 60 minutes or the HBO thing.

1758
01:40:05.341 --> 01:40:09.270
He's fucking crazy and I met him and he was a decent type of guy.
You know?

1759
01:40:09.271 --> 01:40:11.370
I've met above the best dance boy.
He was.
Okay.

1760
01:40:11.371 --> 01:40:15.810
Then he had the cloudwatch was lunch Dykstra.
He was the one who was kicked out.

1761
01:40:15.870 --> 01:40:19.380
Oh please.
Lenny Dykstra did a thousand and whatnot.
His son's date.
The,

1762
01:40:19.770 --> 01:40:24.300
the chicken was surprise.
I see that today.
Rarely.
Yeah.
It's crazy,
bro.

1763
01:40:24.301 --> 01:40:27.240
Really Dicey is crazy.
Yes.
What did he do?

1764
01:40:27.241 --> 01:40:31.110
Like what was his scam to try to steal cars?
What were they doing?
I don't,

1765
01:40:31.170 --> 01:40:33.380
how do you go from being like a walking?
No,

1766
01:40:33.390 --> 01:40:37.260
but world renowned baseball player to be a guy who steals cars,
whole thing.

1767
01:40:37.590 --> 01:40:41.700
I just know that he went bad and a bunch of people with 60 minutes or was an
HBO,

1768
01:40:42.030 --> 01:40:46.230
the Docu thing,
other but a real sports and he was hysterical.

1769
01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:50.100
I was like,
got it.
He was like,
ah,
you know,
sorry,
you broke right now.

1770
01:40:50.101 --> 01:40:54.370
And he went in his pocket or her fucking broke,
what?
You owe millions.

1771
01:40:54.370 --> 01:40:58.450
<v 3>Fuck up,
fuck my life.
And he was,
you know,
I mean,</v>

1772
01:40:58.451 --> 01:40:59.710
you can't do that.

1773
01:40:59.860 --> 01:41:02.060
So now they're going at him for everything and they're going to get,

1774
01:41:02.070 --> 01:41:05.650
right now he's in a downward spiral.
Right?
It's not only are they watching him,

1775
01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:06.431
but on top of that,

1776
01:41:06.431 --> 01:41:09.700
he's giving them something to do and now he's trying to rob from Peter to pay

1777
01:41:09.701 --> 01:41:12.310
Paul.
You know,
just trying to do what anybody would do and,

1778
01:41:12.730 --> 01:41:13.780
and that fucking thing,

1779
01:41:13.781 --> 01:41:16.630
you're gonna make mistakes and he's going to be a worst shape.
Any,
well,

1780
01:41:16.631 --> 01:41:21.010
what did he do?
He went to the car and tried to sell it.
He did something crazy.

1781
01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:23.200
I don't know what the fuck he did.
I mean,

1782
01:41:23.201 --> 01:41:25.960
it's just instead of coke thing is that,
is that what happens?

1783
01:41:25.961 --> 01:41:27.370
Because there is there drugs involved.

1784
01:41:27.371 --> 01:41:31.930
When guys started making terrible decisions,
I take with desperation,
get crazy.

1785
01:41:32.050 --> 01:41:36.460
It's just crazy.
If you see the interview on Hbo,
Real Sports,
you'll go,

1786
01:41:36.490 --> 01:41:37.810
there's something wrong.
They guys,

1787
01:41:37.811 --> 01:41:40.990
where would you give him a load for fucking $2 million.
This guy,

1788
01:41:40.991 --> 01:41:42.400
the plane he was flying around,

1789
01:41:42.610 --> 01:41:46.120
he would go for Bali with the collar bosses in a plane,
bitch.
Wow.

1790
01:41:46.150 --> 01:41:49.300
You know what I mean?
This guy was crazy butlers and Austin,
he lost her.

1791
01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:53.320
He was living in his house.
They took the furniture.
I took everything.
Wow.

1792
01:41:53.350 --> 01:41:55.360
But I do remember that when he went in his pocket,

1793
01:41:55.390 --> 01:41:58.480
he had hit the fucking thing and he's like,
I'm not broke bitch.
Check this out.

1794
01:41:58.900 --> 01:42:00.430
You want your money?
Come get it.

1795
01:42:03.430 --> 01:42:05.680
Very coke heavy episode we got going on here.

1796
01:42:08.810 --> 01:42:12.760
But you know it's gotta be hard.
Like I heard Chris talk has been out,

1797
01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:17.260
you know that he's been what out every night he goes to the Haha the Improv,

1798
01:42:17.270 --> 01:42:19.810
the comedy store.
Every night out's good.

1799
01:42:19.870 --> 01:42:23.980
Eight guys doing comedy and he's up there talking cause he doing well.

1800
01:42:24.100 --> 01:42:27.610
He's doing well.
But people are asking them like,
why you must fucking onstage?

1801
01:42:28.090 --> 01:42:30.550
He goes,
cause $20 million ain't shit.

1802
01:42:31.420 --> 01:42:34.810
He goes at the end of the fucker when he goes,
I thought I had 200 million.

1803
01:42:34.811 --> 01:42:37.870
He's been telling the story late in the onstage.
He goes,
I'm broke.

1804
01:42:37.930 --> 01:42:39.160
It's called the government shit.

1805
01:42:39.580 --> 01:42:42.820
Once they come get their ass and a lot of these people bro Spam and they don't

1806
01:42:42.821 --> 01:42:44.990
realize that Uncle Sam Spock and watch it,

1807
01:42:45.190 --> 01:42:48.280
you got to give half of that doe coming in,

1808
01:42:48.281 --> 01:42:50.680
but you don't know and when you're black,
let's face it,

1809
01:42:50.681 --> 01:42:52.390
when you're renting thing,
Joe Rogan people,
you're,

1810
01:42:52.540 --> 01:42:54.160
you're lost relatives start calling

1811
01:42:55.660 --> 01:42:59.530
this guy and that guy and the money goes fast,
Bro.

1812
01:42:59.590 --> 01:43:01.760
You know what's going on with Gallagher right down.

1813
01:43:01.820 --> 01:43:05.650
Andrews had a gang heart attack and he just decided he's retiring no more.

1814
01:43:05.651 --> 01:43:07.720
Go on the road.
He's like,
I'll give them the banks of houses.

1815
01:43:07.721 --> 01:43:11.050
I can't pay for these houses because he's doing like this little comedy clubs

1816
01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:13.990
just to stay alive because I would've thought that Gallagher would have been

1817
01:43:13.991 --> 01:43:15.500
able to draw more than that.
I don't understand.

1818
01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:18.180
That doesn't make sense to me that he has to do these tiny little children.

1819
01:43:18.190 --> 01:43:22.420
I was 20 years ago pro,
but I would think it's still just for the variety of it.

1820
01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:26.440
Look,
he was not,
it wasn't the best show in the world,
but it was ridiculous.

1821
01:43:26.470 --> 01:43:29.050
It was a fun thing to do,
you know,
go see,
move on.

1822
01:43:29.170 --> 01:43:32.530
Shame on him for still taking it to that point for this.

1823
01:43:32.531 --> 01:43:37.531
Depending on fruit house payments are little things that other people don't plan

1824
01:43:37.871 --> 01:43:41.500
ahead.
Did you ever hear him on the Mark Marin show?
No,

1825
01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:46.330
I just heard it this week and uh,
I actually heard a clip of it off of Youtube.

1826
01:43:46.331 --> 01:43:51.260
I heard when he,
uh,
he left and as it's fucking remarkable.
It's really crazy.

1827
01:43:51.261 --> 01:43:52.070
You know,
like a lot of people

1828
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:56.170
<v 4>give mark Marin a hard time for,
uh,
his interview style and you know,</v>

1829
01:43:56.260 --> 01:43:59.570
and for causing,
you know,
uncomfortable moments with people.

1830
01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:03.980
But this shit wasn't him at all.
This guy is crazy.
He didn't hassle.
Oh my God,

1831
01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:06.770
Dude.
First of all,
what he was talking about comics,
you know,

1832
01:44:06.771 --> 01:44:09.590
like saying what they should and shouldn't do.
You know the,

1833
01:44:09.591 --> 01:44:11.630
you shouldn't talk about yourself on stage,

1834
01:44:11.840 --> 01:44:14.090
you know like nobody wants to hear that.
And Marin was like,

1835
01:44:14.091 --> 01:44:14.901
what are you talking about?

1836
01:44:14.901 --> 01:44:18.650
Like what if you have something entertaining to to say on stage like that,

1837
01:44:18.651 --> 01:44:22.580
that some other than that makes you less of a comic.
Like it was preposterous.

1838
01:44:22.581 --> 01:44:23.920
Your life was very different.

1839
01:44:24.200 --> 01:44:27.080
He said it was saying shit like you can never work a state fair.

1840
01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:30.470
And you know in Marin was like who the fuck wants to work at State Fair?

1841
01:44:30.650 --> 01:44:33.500
Like what a weird thing to say.
But that's really what he was saying.

1842
01:44:33.501 --> 01:44:36.310
I mean he was really saying that if you,
you don't,
you,

1843
01:44:36.311 --> 01:44:38.420
you don't do your comedy for everybody,

1844
01:44:38.421 --> 01:44:40.250
you'll never be able to work at state fair.

1845
01:44:40.340 --> 01:44:42.410
You should do it the way I'm doing it.
And he's seen.

1846
01:44:42.411 --> 01:44:44.690
So you're dismissing a great deal of rug,

1847
01:44:44.691 --> 01:44:48.470
really highly respected performers and galleries.
Like they're doing it wrong.

1848
01:44:48.590 --> 01:44:52.400
Is that deck.
It was crazy.
I saw him making fun of a guy with,

1849
01:44:52.430 --> 01:44:54.710
I think we've talked about it.
Yeah.
Cerebral Palsy or something.

1850
01:44:54.740 --> 01:44:57.720
I can't remember what he had is where,
I mean he's,
yeah,
I don't,

1851
01:44:57.750 --> 01:44:59.570
can't walk right and stuff.
And he made fun of them.

1852
01:44:59.720 --> 01:45:02.560
I don't know what it is or why,
why he's like that was huge.

1853
01:45:02.561 --> 01:45:06.990
And his brother tried to rob him when he gave his brother is he gave his brother

1854
01:45:06.991 --> 01:45:10.070
go the whole fucking either sold it to him or something and his brother looked

1855
01:45:10.071 --> 01:45:11.870
just like him.
So it was an easy sell.

1856
01:45:11.871 --> 01:45:16.250
And then he decided to come back and when he decided to come back then he wanted

1857
01:45:16.251 --> 01:45:18.350
his brother to stop and then it became like a real problem.

1858
01:45:18.351 --> 01:45:21.860
So then it was Gallagher and Gallagher too.
You know like his brother was like,

1859
01:45:21.861 --> 01:45:23.630
a lot of people thought they were going to see Gallagher.

1860
01:45:23.631 --> 01:45:25.370
I mean he was essentially doing the same act,

1861
01:45:25.580 --> 01:45:27.530
which is really kind of fucking creepy.

1862
01:45:27.710 --> 01:45:30.320
It's like some invasion of the body snatchers type shit.

1863
01:45:30.470 --> 01:45:32.870
All of a sudden your brothers like taking over your life,

1864
01:45:33.260 --> 01:45:35.600
your brother's on the road doing your jokes,
you know,

1865
01:45:35.601 --> 01:45:39.410
he has access to all of your material from your 14 one hour specials.

1866
01:45:39.411 --> 01:45:43.040
And I guess like they made some sort of a business deal,
but after a while,

1867
01:45:46.250 --> 01:45:51.140
<v 3>I forgot what I was going to tell you.
I quit this shit.
The cookie.</v>

1868
01:45:51.260 --> 01:45:55.080
I knew Joey did something because before the podcast even started,
he's,

1869
01:45:55.090 --> 01:45:58.100
he's the one who put the joint await the quickest.
No,

1870
01:45:58.101 --> 01:46:01.400
I ate a little piece of a bank.
Chocolate.
Those bank chocolates.
Triple strength.

1871
01:46:01.401 --> 01:46:04.880
The Hash.
Yeah.
You're,
you will generally will look like their sandbags right now.

1872
01:46:05.050 --> 01:46:06.670
Oh yeah.
I'm pretty fucked up man.
I'm saying

1873
01:46:09.670 --> 01:46:10.990
it must be amazing.
I'd be,

1874
01:46:11.130 --> 01:46:14.060
I heard you say something to somebody at the store one time and it was,

1875
01:46:14.061 --> 01:46:17.930
it made sense or ah,
the guy,
the guy from Oakland,

1876
01:46:18.050 --> 01:46:22.370
the big guy that had to show about the school teacher,
big guys hanging out,

1877
01:46:22.390 --> 01:46:24.320
Mr. Cooper.
Oh yeah.
You want him,

1878
01:46:24.330 --> 01:46:27.330
we're having a conversation with neighbor next door and he said,

1879
01:46:27.990 --> 01:46:31.190
Mark Curry says awesome dude.
By the way,
he said to you,
you never buy,

1880
01:46:31.220 --> 01:46:35.210
motherfuckers don't know that you don't buy none to the fourth season.
Yeah,

1881
01:46:35.300 --> 01:46:37.940
he did say that.
Or You said it.
Somebody said,

1882
01:46:37.941 --> 01:46:40.810
you don't buy something to the fourth season and what happens to you?

1883
01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:45.140
You make a little bit of scratch ban and it goes,
you know,
Joe,

1884
01:46:45.500 --> 01:46:49.620
even if your financial,
you,
your house is paid for that exist.

1885
01:46:49.650 --> 01:46:53.190
You still got to pay for that.
And it was from the estate tax is still big.

1886
01:46:53.330 --> 01:46:55.080
You have to make money.
$3 million house,

1887
01:46:55.081 --> 01:46:58.290
you still got to make money if pay those fucking taxes and you know what the

1888
01:46:58.291 --> 01:47:01.260
road,
they caught it and you know,
Joe,
you will watch VH one.

1889
01:47:01.261 --> 01:47:02.910
Like where are they now?
You're gonna get stuck.

1890
01:47:02.911 --> 01:47:07.000
You smoking dope in the afternoon and they show like Cherry Pie,
right?
Hey,

1891
01:47:07.010 --> 01:47:11.830
you know,
he just died.
He died out here at the hotel.
Not out here.
He was in,
um,

1892
01:47:11.880 --> 01:47:15.790
I think it was in West hills or woodland.
Hit right around here.
So yeah,
like the,

1893
01:47:15.791 --> 01:47:19.080
like one of those weird hotels that are like right off of the one on one man,

1894
01:47:19.260 --> 01:47:21.930
I'm just giving you an example.
10 miles away from here.
He's got right one,

1895
01:47:21.960 --> 01:47:25.200
don't show last.
They'll show like a one of those bands like eight six,

1896
01:47:25.201 --> 01:47:28.460
seven five three Oh nine let's just take that.
Who knows what happened to them.

1897
01:47:28.461 --> 01:47:33.270
Right?
But to always go to the singer,
the singer Dow has to successful clothing,

1898
01:47:33.271 --> 01:47:37.710
life for children.
That's what they'd comics have never prepared for.

1899
01:47:38.370 --> 01:47:41.490
They fit.
You really think you're fucking act is going to work in 20 years.

1900
01:47:41.491 --> 01:47:45.360
Do you really do 20 years from today?
Want to go out there and talking about DMT?

1901
01:47:45.361 --> 01:47:49.740
I mean I do.
I stopped talking about GMC after the first.

1902
01:47:49.770 --> 01:47:53.530
I'm just six months in the Q and A's.
You have to be prepared.
You have to,

1903
01:47:53.590 --> 01:47:55.680
you have to evolve this.
Yeah,

1904
01:47:55.681 --> 01:47:58.950
well you have to still be relevant because you have to still be doing what you

1905
01:47:58.951 --> 01:48:00.990
want to be doing,
you know?
And that's what's really important.

1906
01:48:01.020 --> 01:48:04.260
So you are in 20 years from now,
you're still in love with stand up.

1907
01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:07.790
I don't suspect that won't be man.
Stand up.

1908
01:48:08.190 --> 01:48:11.490
I love stand up as much now as I did when I first started.

1909
01:48:11.660 --> 01:48:14.550
If you go to Gallagher Gallagher driven thought about doing a podcast,

1910
01:48:14.551 --> 01:48:18.570
you'd say no to because is thinking,
is it like that?
Well,
everybody stand up.

1911
01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:19.810
You know is there's,

1912
01:48:19.950 --> 01:48:24.840
there's some people that the the not like a podcast sort of a guy on about that.

1913
01:48:24.841 --> 01:48:25.890
I'm talking about evolution.

1914
01:48:26.370 --> 01:48:30.750
A lot of these guys been a shit to them at the comedy store.

1915
01:48:30.900 --> 01:48:34.350
There's rumors about the people get off stage at the comedy store and they'd be

1916
01:48:34.351 --> 01:48:36.640
clubbed fucking owners,
right?
They're going,
hey,
wait,
no.

1917
01:48:36.641 --> 01:48:40.410
February 13 here's a plane ticket.
See you then it's a different patois.

1918
01:48:40.590 --> 01:48:41.130
It was a d.

1919
01:48:41.130 --> 01:48:45.210
Even if you see a comic from the 90s and styles a little fucking different guy.

1920
01:48:45.660 --> 01:48:49.500
Okay.
You see it and you can't,
you know,
show that you have to evolve.

1921
01:48:49.620 --> 01:48:51.630
You know what?
I could still do my comedy.

1922
01:48:51.631 --> 01:48:55.830
There's still people that want to see me,
but how we evolve.
I'll do a podcast,

1923
01:48:56.010 --> 01:48:59.790
I'll get a webpage,
I'll draw a blog,
I'll do all of these things.

1924
01:48:59.791 --> 01:49:03.810
It's very important.
The fucking people that I had.
These guys you go to,

1925
01:49:03.811 --> 01:49:07.810
what an idea that is going to enhance it.
They're going to go,
Nah,
I just,

1926
01:49:07.890 --> 01:49:11.340
I'll just get my people on the road find that everybody's on Twitter.

1927
01:49:11.341 --> 01:49:12.990
We had the discussion before the thing.

1928
01:49:13.290 --> 01:49:16.230
One day I find out I'm going to Miami and problem.
I put it on there.

1929
01:49:16.530 --> 01:49:19.200
I call fucking the lady's like,
I don't know what I got for radio.

1930
01:49:19.201 --> 01:49:23.190
I called Bert Kreischer Birch set to go on Ron and Paul.

1931
01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:24.240
I just put on Twitter.

1932
01:49:24.270 --> 01:49:26.550
So you're talking about to promote the show to promote the shit.

1933
01:49:26.930 --> 01:49:29.290
I'm talking about these shows.
I'm talking about any shit,
right,
right.

1934
01:49:29.340 --> 01:49:32.660
I put on Twitter,
Hey,
I'd be suggestions or radio stations in Florida.

1935
01:49:32.670 --> 01:49:36.180
I like to go on put the three days I had 20 people contacting me.

1936
01:49:36.540 --> 01:49:38.940
So if you're a convenient,
you're not fucking around with Twitter,

1937
01:49:39.300 --> 01:49:41.760
you crazy or any businessmen,
anything.

1938
01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:45.650
If you're trying to market a product that you have and you're not on Twitter or

1939
01:49:45.651 --> 01:49:49.870
on a computer and 20 with people and communicating and putting your videos up

1940
01:49:49.871 --> 01:49:52.600
and giving away stuff,
then you're in a different fucking planet.

1941
01:49:52.601 --> 01:49:56.650
Take 2012 if you're a community or you can be the funniest guy in the world.

1942
01:49:57.250 --> 01:50:00.310
Yeah,
I agree with you.
Part of entertainment today,

1943
01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:06.000
I pay for 500 fucking channels a month and soda you six 20 when you had fuel and

1944
01:50:06.281 --> 01:50:10.600
all those copies is fucking channels up there and pay for 600 channels a month.

1945
01:50:10.810 --> 01:50:15.370
But I'm still on my computer,
50 to 60% of my fucking day.
70% of my day.

1946
01:50:15.371 --> 01:50:19.480
I watch a few shows,
the walking dead,
the killing,
but let's fucking face it.

1947
01:50:19.481 --> 01:50:22.570
You might catch a documentary.
We take up the only guy,

1948
01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:25.270
I don't even like the computer.
There's people live on fucking there.

1949
01:50:25.630 --> 01:50:29.320
So if you're not working on there today,
I'm not talking about five years ago,

1950
01:50:29.321 --> 01:50:33.880
Ted Tech and I learned that from La and I tell you all the time from Irvine last

1951
01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:37.600
summer,
no radio,
he's still sold the place out.
1600 seats and seats,

1952
01:50:37.601 --> 01:50:40.630
three pointing times,
five shows.
Yeah,
we stopped.

1953
01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:44.730
<v 2>Do we do still do our friends when we do local radio shows,
you know,</v>

1954
01:50:44.731 --> 01:50:46.380
if it's like,
it's the guys that,
uh,
you know,

1955
01:50:46.381 --> 01:50:48.820
I've done the show before and I look forward to doing it like,
uh,

1956
01:50:48.870 --> 01:50:52.290
like Dale Dudley in Austin,
but we don't have to do anything anymore.
That's,

1957
01:50:52.410 --> 01:50:55.140
that's the crazy thing is it's all our fans now.
It's all,

1958
01:50:55.141 --> 01:50:58.750
I don't even like that word.
It's all our people now,
you know,
and it's,
uh,
we,

1959
01:50:58.780 --> 01:51:02.190
we don't know.
Everyone knows exactly what the fuck is up when they get there.

1960
01:51:02.191 --> 01:51:03.420
It's completely different crowd.

1961
01:51:03.710 --> 01:51:06.860
<v 3>Last year on Christmas,
how much did sales go up on a lot?</v>

1962
01:51:07.610 --> 01:51:11.840
38% in two years.
You're not going to leave the house to buy.

1963
01:51:11.930 --> 01:51:14.180
There's no reason.
Yeah,
that's the Amazon.

1964
01:51:15.340 --> 01:51:19.530
I want to suck Mr Amazon's Vic because he's genius.
Listen Bro.

1965
01:51:20.750 --> 01:51:23.030
And you can do it on your phone,

1966
01:51:23.070 --> 01:51:26.180
but I just got the dolce book to based fucking late.
I got it all.
Whatever.

1967
01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:29.270
I want a coconut water.
I want to fuck a week.
Oh,

1968
01:51:29.390 --> 01:51:33.050
you can order everything off a fucking that I Amazon,
by the way on Amazon,

1969
01:51:33.051 --> 01:51:34.400
you can get on a fucking,
uh,

1970
01:51:34.401 --> 01:51:38.180
a book reader APP and you could watch it and read it on your phone.
You could,

1971
01:51:38.260 --> 01:51:42.590
you could get by a lot of different guys books as a download and read on a book

1972
01:51:42.591 --> 01:51:45.470
reader on your phone so you'd have it on you all the time.
I mean,

1973
01:51:45.471 --> 01:51:48.260
the amount of storage that you're your phone has is incredible.
You know,

1974
01:51:48.530 --> 01:51:52.640
the little,
uh,
I have the little Amazon App on my iPhone.
I fucking,

1975
01:51:53.630 --> 01:51:56.260
I don't know,
20,
30 bucks Amazon App

1976
01:51:56.670 --> 01:52:00.150
<v 2>before you use apples.
I books.
No,
I use that too,</v>

1977
01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:04.380
but I use both of them.
They're,
they're both great.
The I books is awesome too.

1978
01:52:04.381 --> 01:52:08.010
I books I like,
I really love for the IPAD.
It's the Shit I love.

1979
01:52:08.011 --> 01:52:12.120
The turning of the pages as has the graphic.
Have you looked at a new one yet?
No,

1980
01:52:12.121 --> 01:52:15.090
I haven't seen it.
It's really hard to tell,
but yeah,

1981
01:52:15.091 --> 01:52:18.400
you can kind of see a little bit more depth,
but it's not a huge difference.
Yeah.

1982
01:52:18.420 --> 01:52:19.590
To me what it is,

1983
01:52:19.591 --> 01:52:22.590
is the iPad something to like when you're sitting on the couch and you're

1984
01:52:22.591 --> 01:52:23.940
fucking bored,
you know,

1985
01:52:23.941 --> 01:52:27.210
you just fuck around and see what's going on in your email.
See what's going on.

1986
01:52:27.211 --> 01:52:30.540
The message board,
I don't,
it's,
it's,
it's a temporary thing.

1987
01:52:30.541 --> 01:52:33.840
It's like I got to leave in 20 minutes,
let me pick up my iPad for games.

1988
01:52:33.841 --> 01:52:37.200
I think it's way better than anything.
Oh yeah.
For moving and Shit.
Yeah.

1989
01:52:37.201 --> 01:52:38.011
That's incredible.

1990
01:52:38.011 --> 01:52:42.810
The gyroscope in it for kids and I write on right on it.
Yeah,
you could.

1991
01:52:42.811 --> 01:52:45.980
You could write in a note pad.
You know what a box when I

1992
01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:48.300
<v 3>go out alone,
that's what I put all my,
yeah,
I do.</v>

1993
01:52:48.590 --> 01:52:51.060
She got hooked me up with a light lipid.
Brian,
I,
yeah,
sure.
I'll give you one.

1994
01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:54.410
I don't want you to give me one a way to take me to apple and told me what to

1995
01:52:54.411 --> 01:52:58.630
buy.
What I say my iPad too.
But whatever you teach me,

1996
01:52:58.910 --> 01:53:02.570
I got to take something like $400.
What the fuck are you eating over there?

1997
01:53:02.600 --> 01:53:05.520
What are you fucking Mitch American Ale.
I tried to hide these things from you.

1998
01:53:07.220 --> 01:53:11.600
They stop.
You know what I'm saying?
I know,
but just talk.
I'm over here thinking,

1999
01:53:11.601 --> 01:53:15.410
well,
I took my fish capsules today.
I did.
You got the ultra man.

2000
01:53:15.800 --> 01:53:20.400
You got everything here.
I ain't.
You got everything over here.
I

2001
01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:24.990
<v 1>was going to be on opie and Anthony last night.
I was like,
all right,
on the line.</v>

2002
01:53:24.991 --> 01:53:26.010
But then I got too tired.

2003
01:53:26.011 --> 01:53:30.840
I just hung up by me and Anthony were both up for that Shorty Award Bullshit,
uh,

2004
01:53:30.841 --> 01:53:32.340
for web show.
That was nonsense.

2005
01:53:32.700 --> 01:53:36.810
Let me tell the story of Joe and so me and like Jim Norton was also up,

2006
01:53:36.811 --> 01:53:41.700
I think for me what a shorty shorty award.

2007
01:53:41.880 --> 01:53:45.210
This is something I found out during all this shorter your word is it's like you

2008
01:53:45.211 --> 01:53:48.670
get nominated by people and then you,
uh,
the most,

2009
01:53:48.720 --> 01:53:52.590
the top five or there's all these categories like your,
your best comedian,

2010
01:53:52.620 --> 01:53:55.500
best web show and there's a lot of categories.

2011
01:53:55.680 --> 01:53:59.220
And so if people start voting for you,
then you know,

2012
01:53:59.221 --> 01:54:03.890
you the top seven people I think,
uh,
get,
uh,

2013
01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:06.090
nominated for that category.

2014
01:54:06.091 --> 01:54:08.910
So like out of like hundreds and hundreds of hundreds of people.

2015
01:54:08.911 --> 01:54:12.320
I was in the top seven,
I was number three,
I think.
Uh,

2016
01:54:12.430 --> 01:54:16.410
and so it was Anthony from opie and Anthony and some wrestler named Zack rider

2017
01:54:16.411 --> 01:54:20.560
or something like that.
And uh,
so the,
the,

2018
01:54:20.570 --> 01:54:22.590
the top seven or up for this nominee.

2019
01:54:22.591 --> 01:54:26.680
And then everyone's started telling me like,
uh,
hey,
you know,

2020
01:54:26.681 --> 01:54:28.230
that shit's just a scam.

2021
01:54:28.440 --> 01:54:32.610
What they do is they get you everyone to vote for you on Twitter.

2022
01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:37.590
And then,
uh,
so all these people are trying to win.
Like Anthony's tweeting,

2023
01:54:37.591 --> 01:54:40.950
I'm tweeting,
hey,
please vote for me.
All these people are tweeting.

2024
01:54:41.070 --> 01:54:45.630
So it just thinks everyone,
it just advertises the shorty awards.

2025
01:54:45.810 --> 01:54:48.620
And then,
so everybody then Ha uh,

2026
01:54:48.870 --> 01:54:53.250
who wins the shorty awards they have like,
it's very suspect like who wins.

2027
01:54:53.251 --> 01:54:57.510
So it's almost like the shorty words like this is big scam to promote certain

2028
01:54:57.511 --> 01:55:02.090
things is do you feel that it's a scam because you lost no,
no,

2029
01:55:02.130 --> 01:55:06.610
I heard this before.
It ended and so who won?
I stopped,

2030
01:55:06.630 --> 01:55:09.180
I stopped kind of promoting the shorty awards.

2031
01:55:09.240 --> 01:55:13.020
I near the end because people were telling me at all about it.
And so then,
uh,

2032
01:55:13.050 --> 01:55:16.350
when I watched it like Jim Norton wasn't,
we was up for best comedian.

2033
01:55:16.351 --> 01:55:17.184
I don't know who won that.

2034
01:55:17.730 --> 01:55:20.790
Anthony was I who I thought we should have one but then this is like

2035
01:55:20.940 --> 01:55:22.340
miscellaneous girl that I,

2036
01:55:22.341 --> 01:55:26.160
everyone's telling me it's like it's the worst show ever.
And there's like,

2037
01:55:26.161 --> 01:55:30.440
she had like one eighth of the vote that Anthony had or one 10th of the above

2038
01:55:30.450 --> 01:55:33.870
even.
I tried to generalize about things too much,
but in general,

2039
01:55:33.900 --> 01:55:37.500
all the categories we were like,
I think award shows are fucking stupid.

2040
01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:39.520
Why would you can,
that's what I feel is,

2041
01:55:39.540 --> 01:55:44.100
the only reason why I even questioned it more is because after get nominated,

2042
01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:48.390
they have the ceremony in New York and then they immediately sent me an email

2043
01:55:48.391 --> 01:55:51.980
for like for the $400 package,
you get to come in and,

2044
01:55:52.080 --> 01:55:55.320
and meet with other people and stuff like that.
And as soon as I,

2045
01:55:55.330 --> 01:55:59.550
so they're selling you a vacation package or they're selling you like really

2046
01:55:59.551 --> 01:56:02.350
expensive tickets,
even if you're nominated for awards.

2047
01:56:02.510 --> 01:56:07.510
So you can't go to the award unless you pay to go to the or something like that.

2048
01:56:07.580 --> 01:56:08.311
So wait a minute.

2049
01:56:08.311 --> 01:56:12.470
So they're offering you to buy tickets to go to an award show or you're

2050
01:56:12.480 --> 01:56:14.440
nominated?
Yes,
that is.

2051
01:56:15.160 --> 01:56:18.030
So it's a big money making venture moneymaking convention.

2052
01:56:18.250 --> 01:56:20.880
And I would say I'm not,
this is just my opinion.

2053
01:56:20.910 --> 01:56:24.900
I would say that the people that one,
that there's a reason why they all want it.

2054
01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:27.600
You know,
there's a reason why they all want to think it's all horse shit.

2055
01:56:27.630 --> 01:56:30.480
I think it's a horse.
I Dunno.
A hug.

2056
01:56:30.490 --> 01:56:33.890
And the other weird though because once in a while they give it to somebody

2057
01:56:33.910 --> 01:56:36.450
legit like Conan O'brien or something like that just so they could have a photo

2058
01:56:36.451 --> 01:56:40.170
of him holding it and then it's like it's don't money may have to like quantify,

2059
01:56:40.171 --> 01:56:41.730
like calculate,
look,

2060
01:56:42.510 --> 01:56:45.300
we're visible children's shit that's going on right now and that guy said he was

2061
01:56:45.301 --> 01:56:48.210
going to keep,
but 90% of the donation or something like that.
That's done.

2062
01:56:48.230 --> 01:56:52.500
Amazing.
Yeah,
it's a funny,
people are trying to find ways to make money.

2063
01:56:52.530 --> 01:56:54.550
They got him on video.
One of the guys on video words,

2064
01:56:54.570 --> 01:56:58.100
I caught that shit before the naked incident.
I will give,

2065
01:56:59.690 --> 01:57:02.610
I will give you money directly if you need it,
but,

2066
01:57:02.740 --> 01:57:06.300
and it breaks my heart when you see a hurricane or you see an earthquake and you

2067
01:57:06.301 --> 01:57:10.380
want us 50 bucks or a hundred but at the back of my mind I say,
why?

2068
01:57:10.740 --> 01:57:14.910
Because I've worked for those organizations where you sign up with the cops.

2069
01:57:14.911 --> 01:57:17.970
For example,
when you call people and go,
Joe Rogan,
how you doing?
Joe Diaz,

2070
01:57:18.510 --> 01:57:22.840
PB 92 here,
we'll call it,
because the cops didn't want to get bulletproof things.

2071
01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:26.040
If you sign up with us for advertising in our book,

2072
01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:29.090
we will give you a sticker and that goes to the back of your car.

2073
01:57:29.100 --> 01:57:30.900
When you get pulled over for a ticket,

2074
01:57:31.170 --> 01:57:34.890
you tell the cop you donated and he'll lead.
You see it.
All this bullshit.

2075
01:57:35.250 --> 01:57:39.150
So let's say you donate 500 how much do you actually think goes to that?

2076
01:57:39.450 --> 01:57:44.070
That's the good question.
30% 30% 30 something percent.
Okay,

2077
01:57:44.340 --> 01:57:47.730
so basically your 500 and that's even if it goes,

2078
01:57:48.180 --> 01:57:52.110
that's even if it goes at what w we fucking earthquake.

2079
01:57:52.111 --> 01:57:56.550
Every catastrophe,
there's always donations and two years later,
what do you read?

2080
01:57:56.660 --> 01:58:00.660
Yeah,
somebody clipped the donation.
You Wyclef Jean with the fucking Haiti.

2081
01:58:00.661 --> 01:58:03.420
$1 million.
A lot of fucking money.
When people give it to you,

2082
01:58:03.610 --> 01:58:06.360
and I'm not saying he's stolen,
I'm not little judge,
but I'm just saying,

2083
01:58:06.690 --> 01:58:10.710
you know you have all that money.
Why was he being accused of why Clef is wrong?

2084
01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:14.370
His fucking organization for Haiti though,
the Haiti Foundation,

2085
01:58:14.400 --> 01:58:17.730
that's just money laundering pretty much,
right?
I don't really,
that's how you,

2086
01:58:17.731 --> 01:58:21.900
if you got tons of money.
So I think,
you know what I think,
I think people,

2087
01:58:21.901 --> 01:58:24.960
they start out with ideas of doing something that helps,

2088
01:58:25.230 --> 01:58:28.380
but they also want to get paid and it's difficult job and they feel like they

2089
01:58:28.381 --> 01:58:29.880
should get paid along with helping.

2090
01:58:29.881 --> 01:58:34.080
So a certain percentage of the money has to go towards the staff and that's just

2091
01:58:34.081 --> 01:58:37.200
how they feel and it becomes a business.
You said to me,
you were going,

2092
01:58:37.220 --> 01:58:40.380
nothing wrong with being paid to do charitable work.
I understand.

2093
01:58:40.470 --> 01:58:42.040
But if you said to me,
you will go

2094
01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:45.400
<v 4>to Haiti and I gave you a hundred bucks and you said to me,
Joey,</v>

2095
01:58:45.401 --> 01:58:48.460
I'm going to take all the money I get and I'm gonna pay for a plane ticket and

2096
01:58:48.700 --> 01:58:52.240
whatever.
I then,
as I understand that,
that's what I understand.

2097
01:58:52.690 --> 01:58:56.620
I don't understand what I'm giving you a hundred bucks and you got to take Brian

2098
01:58:56.621 --> 01:59:01.330
with you and probably for the lights at your office and your car off on it.
Well,

2099
01:59:01.331 --> 01:59:05.690
they have to have some sort of infrastructure,
but 30% of what I've given you,

2100
01:59:05.691 --> 01:59:06.461
it seems too much,

2101
01:59:06.461 --> 01:59:10.870
but I've had 31% of business is fucking really expensive to run,
man.
You know,

2102
01:59:10.871 --> 01:59:13.990
it's expensive to buy plane tickets are expensive to ship things.

2103
01:59:13.991 --> 01:59:16.870
It's expensive to keep the lights on,
keep the heat on,

2104
01:59:16.871 --> 01:59:20.380
keep the air conditioning on,
key people getting checks every fucking week.

2105
01:59:20.410 --> 01:59:21.700
Steady checks every week.

2106
01:59:21.701 --> 01:59:24.910
You've got to keep money coming in every week in order to just pay these people

2107
01:59:24.911 --> 01:59:26.530
to stay inside the organization.

2108
01:59:26.530 --> 01:59:29.850
It's a constant money eating machine and I think a lot of people aren't,

2109
01:59:29.990 --> 01:59:32.470
are aware of that.
When you think about some,
any,

2110
01:59:32.471 --> 01:59:35.080
any charitable organizations like yeah,
everything costs money.

2111
01:59:35.340 --> 01:59:37.960
The world costs money.
So it's,
it's,

2112
01:59:37.961 --> 01:59:41.590
it's hard for these people to figure out a way to do it and balance it.
Right.

2113
01:59:41.591 --> 01:59:44.860
That said,
and you get sound from like the Coney situation you got,

2114
01:59:44.890 --> 01:59:48.910
you got some fucking crazy assholes.
That's what you got there.
You know,

2115
01:59:48.911 --> 01:59:52.870
you got some guy who could,
that guy who went crazy in San Diego,

2116
01:59:52.990 --> 01:59:57.070
could he have put more gay flare and to what he was doing when he was running

2117
01:59:57.071 --> 01:59:59.200
around throwing his arms through the air.
And I mean,

2118
01:59:59.350 --> 02:00:03.640
that guy clearly has some sort of a weird fucking nutty suppression.

2119
02:00:03.850 --> 02:00:08.210
He went nuts.
He pulled off this scam,
made some stupid amount of money.

2120
02:00:08.211 --> 02:00:10.930
It probably looked at his paypal account,
did some math,

2121
02:00:10.960 --> 02:00:15.670
and just ran outside and said,
I god,
I be me.
And I thought that this was it.

2122
02:00:15.671 --> 02:00:15.861
You know,

2123
02:00:15.861 --> 02:00:18.970
it was just going to run naked through the streets of San Diego and beat off in

2124
02:00:18.971 --> 02:00:21.010
front of fucking passing by a car.
It'd be fair.

2125
02:00:21.011 --> 02:00:23.980
He was running with invisible children.
We just couldn't see it.
Oh,

2126
02:00:23.981 --> 02:00:28.180
they were all in those.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's fucking fascinating situation,
man.

2127
02:00:29.590 --> 02:00:32.660
That guy made a lot of money really quickly.
Yeah.
If you're gonna have a charity,

2128
02:00:32.661 --> 02:00:34.630
you might as well call it something like an invisible children too.

2129
02:00:34.631 --> 02:00:36.730
So in the court courtroom,
you could always use a defense.

2130
02:00:36.731 --> 02:00:39.370
Like it was called invisible children.
Seriously.
It didn't,

2131
02:00:39.371 --> 02:00:40.690
didn't no one figure that out.

2132
02:00:40.691 --> 02:00:44.560
I wonder how this is going to play out because it's obvious now that everybody's

2133
02:00:44.561 --> 02:00:47.710
been hustled right now.
It's pretty obvious that the guy's crazy.

2134
02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:50.730
The other guy said something really tedious.

2135
02:00:50.980 --> 02:00:53.680
If you have donated to this guy,
you can get a,

2136
02:00:53.681 --> 02:00:58.210
paypal lets you reverse it for up to I think three months.

2137
02:00:58.270 --> 02:01:02.760
So it's even longer than if visa card.
So was,
hm.

2138
02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:07.090
I wonder who paid and which way.
I think most people probably use paypal.

2139
02:01:07.091 --> 02:01:10.720
I want to use it,
but ladies and gentlemen,
I don't want to advise you what to do,

2140
02:01:10.721 --> 02:01:15.520
but I think you know Jesus fucking Christ.
Don't let that go.

2141
02:01:15.750 --> 02:01:17.860
Cody situation is very unique and stuff.

2142
02:01:18.500 --> 02:01:20.250
I'll tell you what's going to scare the shit out.

2143
02:01:20.260 --> 02:01:23.590
I'll go Joey guys is the Trevor fucking situation in Florida.

2144
02:01:24.490 --> 02:01:28.420
That's not good.
That's not good.
That's good.
That's the beginning of his wheels.

2145
02:01:28.421 --> 02:01:29.710
Go to this country right now.

2146
02:01:30.130 --> 02:01:32.980
There's wheels going and you could tell me that the kids smoke pot and he got

2147
02:01:32.981 --> 02:01:34.030
suspended from school.
Yeah.

2148
02:01:34.070 --> 02:01:37.540
That doesn't mean show said that you stopped following the fucking kid.

2149
02:01:37.880 --> 02:01:40.130
You know what they're going to have to this guy at somebody.

2150
02:01:40.150 --> 02:01:42.020
<v 3>It's going to get you down in Florida.</v>

2151
02:01:42.021 --> 02:01:46.400
Dog with those brothers are fucking crazy and that heat and all that.

2152
02:01:46.401 --> 02:01:50.300
My God bought juice and shit.
You know it's going to be bad.
That happened.

2153
02:01:50.310 --> 02:01:54.440
Rallies all over the country thing is so scary.
It's very scary.
Gentlemen.

2154
02:01:54.950 --> 02:01:56.450
Strap a fucking pair out.

2155
02:01:56.451 --> 02:01:59.150
If they don't arrest this mother fucker within the next week and do something,

2156
02:01:59.180 --> 02:02:02.910
they got to do something and you know what?
That guy had tried to be a cop.

2157
02:02:02.950 --> 02:02:07.040
You injected those shit.
This is an easy story to figure out.

2158
02:02:07.080 --> 02:02:08.030
Not only that he was,

2159
02:02:08.090 --> 02:02:12.560
he had a string of ridiculous nine one one call Stab my God.

2160
02:02:12.590 --> 02:02:15.740
Fucking long.
Nine one one slash two year old kid.

2161
02:02:15.800 --> 02:02:18.200
There was a nine year old kid in his neighborhood and he called nine one one

2162
02:02:18.800 --> 02:02:21.890
fucking prepared for that one because of that shit though.
Strap on.

2163
02:02:22.250 --> 02:02:25.220
I'd give it another 10 days before this.
Something starts.

2164
02:02:25.490 --> 02:02:29.090
Something where to start.
We're go in there man.
It has to.
It has to.

2165
02:02:29.390 --> 02:02:33.050
It's going to be like puff fucking fight the power and do the right thing at the

2166
02:02:33.051 --> 02:02:37.010
end with the fucking brothers.
We crazy bedstuy and it's going to be fucking,

2167
02:02:37.160 --> 02:02:38.740
you know what?
I can't blame them.

2168
02:02:38.780 --> 02:02:42.770
What part of Florida is this all going down in Sanford,
Stanford safe,

2169
02:02:43.460 --> 02:02:46.550
something like that.
Close to Miami,
I think.
I don't know exactly the point.

2170
02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:47.630
We're going to Hollywood.

2171
02:02:47.631 --> 02:02:51.590
I'm going to be with Jeff Duncan Trussell at the Improv April 13th,

2172
02:02:51.591 --> 02:02:54.440
14th and 15th.
The improv in Fort Lauderdale.

2173
02:02:54.530 --> 02:02:56.900
I just been watching this thing or not.

2174
02:02:57.890 --> 02:03:00.500
I'm watching this thing escalate just exactly where it is.

2175
02:03:00.501 --> 02:03:03.260
See exactly where it is.
A little brother.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's kind of interesting.

2176
02:03:03.261 --> 02:03:04.094
You know,
we'll look,

2177
02:03:04.580 --> 02:03:09.440
<v 4>uh,
it's,
it's,
it's fucked up man.
There's,
there's no bringing a kid back.</v>

2178
02:03:09.830 --> 02:03:11.690
You know,
it's,
it's fucked up period.
We,

2179
02:03:11.691 --> 02:03:15.230
even if the kid did something like even if the kid was a punk,

2180
02:03:15.260 --> 02:03:17.660
even if the kid was,
I mean,
there is no,

2181
02:03:17.661 --> 02:03:22.520
bringing a kid back then were really the most disturbing thing to me always is

2182
02:03:22.730 --> 02:03:25.130
lost potential.
You know?
And any,

2183
02:03:25.131 --> 02:03:28.820
any person who's been a punk at 15 and 16,
you know,

2184
02:03:28.880 --> 02:03:32.270
deserves a chance to learn from their mistakes.
Every kid does.
I mean,

2185
02:03:32.480 --> 02:03:37.010
outside of horrible,
sociopathic crimes and murders and things along those lines,

2186
02:03:37.430 --> 02:03:40.130
every kid,
you know,
everybody makes mistakes,

2187
02:03:40.131 --> 02:03:44.880
especially people without poor guidance or in a bad environment.
So,
you know,

2188
02:03:45.020 --> 02:03:49.430
regardless of what happened that day,
I feel terrible because this,
you know,
this,

2189
02:03:49.870 --> 02:03:53.510
uh,
a potential is gone.
You know,
that's how he got to look at a kid.

2190
02:03:53.870 --> 02:03:58.070
A kid is his potential.
I know so many people look at you.

2191
02:03:58.160 --> 02:04:02.390
I know so many people that at one point in their life were not good people.

2192
02:04:02.391 --> 02:04:04.610
There were,
there were fucked up to run a bad place,

2193
02:04:04.820 --> 02:04:07.580
but they turned around and became some of my favorite people.
You know,

2194
02:04:07.581 --> 02:04:08.810
you're a perfect example.
I mean,

2195
02:04:08.811 --> 02:04:11.910
you always telling these stories about about kidnapping.

2196
02:04:12.030 --> 02:04:16.140
<v 3>Dude,
fucking tie him up with a machine gun,
but do one of my favorite people.</v>

2197
02:04:16.940 --> 02:04:20.550
But you're one of my favorite people on the planet,
you know,
and I,
you know,

2198
02:04:20.551 --> 02:04:22.180
you come over and play with my kids.
Yeah.
You

2199
02:04:22.190 --> 02:04:22.970
<v 4>know what I'm saying?</v>

2200
02:04:22.970 --> 02:04:27.970
It's like people don't realize that people actually absolutely can change.

2201
02:04:29.150 --> 02:04:32.330
It is very possible.
So when you see a young kid dying,

2202
02:04:32.331 --> 02:04:36.650
even if the kid was doing something bad,
I mean,
you know,
kid was,
yeah,

2203
02:04:37.060 --> 02:04:38.160
there's just a huge head

2204
02:04:38.460 --> 02:04:41.130
<v 3>criminals and there's confusion.
People,</v>

2205
02:04:41.131 --> 02:04:43.740
kids don't know what the fuck they want to do.
I was lost.

2206
02:04:44.370 --> 02:04:47.790
I thought I wanted to do.
And once I did it,
I seen the reality of it.

2207
02:04:47.850 --> 02:04:51.050
I never did it again.
And for some people they'll take the lesson,

2208
02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:51.671
they run with it,

2209
02:04:51.671 --> 02:04:55.140
and for some other people they fucking keep doing what they were doing because

2210
02:04:55.141 --> 02:04:58.080
they don't really want to go anywhere.
And I'm really want to go anywhere.

2211
02:04:58.081 --> 02:04:59.520
Even in my darkest moments,

2212
02:04:59.940 --> 02:05:03.600
I always just wanted a little bit of light so I could shut just to go forward.

2213
02:05:03.630 --> 02:05:05.790
That's all.
I was almost like a hallmark card.
That's beautiful.

2214
02:05:06.510 --> 02:05:10.800
I wasn't looking for anything.
I was looking for 15 hours just to get me started.

2215
02:05:11.580 --> 02:05:15.060
That's it.
To get an apartment,
to get a car.
All I wanted,

2216
02:05:15.061 --> 02:05:19.380
but it was between the addiction and the things around me and myself and my

2217
02:05:19.381 --> 02:05:24.000
weaknesses.
It was a spinning ball that you can't get yourself out of the weapon.

2218
02:05:24.001 --> 02:05:27.990
The fuck does up there watching me that I got a break and whatever and today I'm

2219
02:05:27.991 --> 02:05:29.970
not fucking let them know or whatever,
but I'm alive.

2220
02:05:30.240 --> 02:05:32.150
When I wake up in the mornings I'm alive though.

2221
02:05:32.190 --> 02:05:35.640
I didn't think I was going to be alive at 49 you know the funny you kit.

2222
02:05:36.120 --> 02:05:39.750
I didn't want to be alive at 49 but now I want to be alive.
Man.

2223
02:05:40.230 --> 02:05:42.490
It's beautiful because I crossed over.

2224
02:05:42.500 --> 02:05:44.280
I don't have that thing in the back of your mind,

2225
02:05:44.281 --> 02:05:48.330
which is addiction and the same thing people have with their gay or when they're

2226
02:05:48.331 --> 02:05:49.680
in the closet.
About something.

2227
02:05:49.681 --> 02:05:53.820
They did that in ways that bears heavy on your fucking soul.

2228
02:05:54.120 --> 02:05:56.730
It doesn't bear on your psyche,
in your soul.

2229
02:05:57.030 --> 02:06:00.930
I always felt less than what I was,
even if I killed,

2230
02:06:01.200 --> 02:06:05.900
because I'm still a fucking junkie.
That always circling your fucking don't man.

2231
02:06:06.030 --> 02:06:09.190
You know?
And that's why I always,
I feel bad for us.

2232
02:06:09.210 --> 02:06:11.760
I see something sometimes and I know exactly what it is.

2233
02:06:12.090 --> 02:06:14.180
You know when a guy wants to be a cop,
you guys,

2234
02:06:14.190 --> 02:06:16.710
you grew up with that we'll fucking cops.
When they were eight,

2235
02:06:16.980 --> 02:06:21.600
they were school guards and they took it a little bit too cool.
I'm like,
bitch,

2236
02:06:21.870 --> 02:06:22.810
you don't even get paid for it.

2237
02:06:22.811 --> 02:06:25.170
Somebody steal your fucking lunchbox and they in the head with it,

2238
02:06:25.440 --> 02:06:27.450
there's a lot of kids and they grow up and they,
you know,

2239
02:06:27.451 --> 02:06:30.720
they have the flag on their shirt.
She's just Christ.
You know,

2240
02:06:30.721 --> 02:06:34.230
these specs are taking over and then they go for the cop test and there's a

2241
02:06:34.231 --> 02:06:37.320
problem.
They fucking psychologically fucking deranged.

2242
02:06:37.620 --> 02:06:41.970
So now they become a security guard at a mall and they take that job to fucking

2243
02:06:41.971 --> 02:06:45.180
seriously last night I'm mythos.
What Kevin James Movie,

2244
02:06:45.600 --> 02:06:49.860
Paul Blart Mall Cop to get dark and for some people it's a job for some people.

2245
02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:54.210
I got a nine one one here.
Shut the fuck up.

2246
02:06:54.510 --> 02:06:57.600
I stole a pack of fucking God.
You fucking moron.

2247
02:06:57.660 --> 02:06:59.400
Some people like to control people.

2248
02:06:59.430 --> 02:07:03.700
You know when I watch a cop show and they high five when they busted him,
but oh,

2249
02:07:04.740 --> 02:07:05.910
we did.
What'd you do?

2250
02:07:06.360 --> 02:07:09.990
<v 2>Did you know that?
Uh,
Tim Sylvia is a cop.
No.
Yeah.</v>

2251
02:07:10.230 --> 02:07:15.210
Where I forgot.
I think it's somewhere.
I mean it was cold out wherever it was.

2252
02:07:15.230 --> 02:07:19.230
I guess probably Iowa.
Southern Iowa.
Yeah.
It might not be Iowa.

2253
02:07:20.160 --> 02:07:24.270
No,
he was a fucking cop.
He was a,
is doing a lot of,
um,

2254
02:07:24.660 --> 02:07:28.410
a lot of us ships as a,
as a police officer.
They showed,

2255
02:07:28.411 --> 02:07:32.970
they went on tour with them or tour on tour with them on to went on,
uh,
on,
uh,

2256
02:07:33.000 --> 02:07:35.950
when he was out doing his rounds.
And uh,

2257
02:07:36.040 --> 02:07:38.080
<v 3>will they say cruising?
What'd you say?</v>

2258
02:07:39.100 --> 02:07:42.830
Cops follows cruiser following his cruiser.
Following a following around.

2259
02:07:43.300 --> 02:07:46.090
Isn't it funny that it can be a cruiser with a cop,
but anybody else,

2260
02:07:46.110 --> 02:07:49.220
you look in the soccer guys deck,
it's trolling now you're cruising,

2261
02:07:49.790 --> 02:07:54.690
you know if you're cruising cruising for men.
Right.
Anyway,
he's um,
he's,
he,

2262
02:07:54.820 --> 02:07:59.320
he does,
he's trying to get back into the UFC I guess,
but he's um,
doing like,

2263
02:07:59.350 --> 02:08:03.160
you know,
like,
oh,
he's taking some small fights and he's works as a cop.

2264
02:08:03.340 --> 02:08:05.320
I was actually likes doing it,
you know,

2265
02:08:05.690 --> 02:08:09.250
it seems like it'd be a nice guy to get pulled over by a big chip on the

2266
02:08:09.251 --> 02:08:11.170
shoulder.
Yes.
Some guys,

2267
02:08:11.171 --> 02:08:14.290
you could tell some people want to be cops with the right reason,

2268
02:08:14.291 --> 02:08:16.600
for the right reasons,
but I mean that's,
those are logic.

2269
02:08:17.410 --> 02:08:21.280
There's a way to get fucking flies with Gaba instead of fucking vinegar.

2270
02:08:21.480 --> 02:08:26.320
Last class that I get alcohol,
they do Monday night to do the comedy contest,

2271
02:08:26.820 --> 02:08:30.310
come back with the laugh factory.
I pull over by the Ha and the kid says,
dog,

2272
02:08:30.311 --> 02:08:32.320
you want to go up?
I said,
sure,
I'll close the show out.

2273
02:08:32.321 --> 02:08:35.560
While they do they count that they write.
It was black heavy audience last night.

2274
02:08:35.830 --> 02:08:39.010
Okay.
If there was 60 people,
there was a 30 brothers,

2275
02:08:39.011 --> 02:08:42.330
they went to the sea as well.
Black kid from Chicago.
I didn't watch him.

2276
02:08:42.331 --> 02:08:45.140
I got there late and I went on stage,
whatever again,

2277
02:08:45.220 --> 02:08:47.260
off the show ended were outside.

2278
02:08:47.261 --> 02:08:50.800
I'm talking to the AG casino and his brothers standing,

2279
02:08:51.070 --> 02:08:55.330
three of Nice guys just talking,
talking about tomorrow's job,

2280
02:08:55.660 --> 02:08:59.710
but there's no cars on Lankershim so that there's no cars parked.

2281
02:09:00.010 --> 02:09:03.690
So the one guy,
is it the street,
six inches from the sidewalk talking.

2282
02:09:03.940 --> 02:09:06.040
You know how sometimes you're smoking a cigarette away from people?

2283
02:09:06.640 --> 02:09:09.490
Fucking carp is a likership.
Well,
I'm watching this cop.

2284
02:09:09.491 --> 02:09:12.700
He said the light and all of a sudden he comes up to where these guys are

2285
02:09:12.701 --> 02:09:13.181
standing.

2286
02:09:13.181 --> 02:09:17.050
It stops and 10 cars or behind the traffic and he just stops and looks at him.

2287
02:09:17.370 --> 02:09:20.590
He puts this thing on.
He goes,
Hey,
get back on the fucking sidewalk.

2288
02:09:21.270 --> 02:09:23.230
If the guys like all of a sudden I'm doing a shoe shine,

2289
02:09:23.231 --> 02:09:26.200
the light like this tool that your people out there walking around,

2290
02:09:26.500 --> 02:09:28.750
this guy's being fucking Johnny bananas out there.

2291
02:09:29.170 --> 02:09:30.610
So then he puts the light on me.

2292
02:09:30.670 --> 02:09:34.000
I'm just over there by the corner talking to the ex didn't go what?
And he goes,

2293
02:09:34.010 --> 02:09:37.450
he turns around and makes sure you turn.
He goes,
what'd you say to me?
I said,
God,

2294
02:09:38.140 --> 02:09:41.140
you over there harassing three fucking black guys with the problems we've got

2295
02:09:41.141 --> 02:09:44.890
this country going on right now.
Use Your fucking head.
What's wrong?
Where you,

2296
02:09:44.891 --> 02:09:47.740
and he looked at me.
What's your name?
I got my got my id in the car.

2297
02:09:47.741 --> 02:09:50.470
I wasn't drinking.
I got another bad guy,
but we'd look,
I don't give a fuck.

2298
02:09:50.860 --> 02:09:54.370
That's what you're worried about.
Three guys.
What do you care?
Look at it.
Well,

2299
02:09:54.371 --> 02:09:57.880
you can't let them get hit by the fucking car doing his job.
No,

2300
02:09:57.881 --> 02:09:58.990
but your fucking business,

2301
02:09:58.991 --> 02:10:01.680
there's things you look at and there's things you don't fucking look at.

2302
02:10:01.681 --> 02:10:03.580
What did you ever go to Hollywood?

2303
02:10:03.581 --> 02:10:07.050
You drive into crossing the street as I fucking all set.

2304
02:10:07.060 --> 02:10:08.050
There's a fucking new organs.

2305
02:10:08.110 --> 02:10:12.190
There's a bunch of traffic and Hollywood and you go around and you realize it's

2306
02:10:12.191 --> 02:10:16.300
a cop pulling over a homeless guy.
That's another,
the quarter lane there puking.

2307
02:10:16.450 --> 02:10:20.200
So he pulls over like Adam 12 so you can have all this fucking traffic.

2308
02:10:20.201 --> 02:10:21.034
Really Bitch.

2309
02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:23.710
Where were you when they were shooting motherfuckers up in north Hollywood

2310
02:10:23.760 --> 02:10:25.240
motherfucker.
You know what I'm saying?

2311
02:10:25.241 --> 02:10:28.210
Like they act like really you're going to pull over to bother a whole bi thing.

2312
02:10:28.211 --> 02:10:31.540
We can agree that there are some county cops.
No,
but there's cops.

2313
02:10:32.470 --> 02:10:33.980
Great cops to know.
There's great

2314
02:10:33.980 --> 02:10:36.770
<v 2>fucking cops.
The ones that look to you for what the fuck it is.
Yeah.</v>

2315
02:10:36.830 --> 02:10:38.840
And they're like dog,
are you fucking serious?
Yeah.

2316
02:10:38.900 --> 02:10:41.930
We've talked about this before on the podcast and one of the problems is quotas.

2317
02:10:42.170 --> 02:10:45.440
You know they,
they to an order to show that they're doing their job,

2318
02:10:45.441 --> 02:10:46.700
they have to catch people doing shit,

2319
02:10:46.730 --> 02:10:50.150
especially speeding and certain times of the month you guys get crazy speed.

2320
02:10:50.360 --> 02:10:53.950
It's ridiculous.
It's incredible that that's a,
that's like,

2321
02:10:53.951 --> 02:10:57.530
it's really a tactic because then what would happen if it was ever completely

2322
02:10:57.531 --> 02:10:58.530
resolved?
What,
what,

2323
02:10:58.550 --> 02:11:01.100
what the fuck would they ever do if everybody just follow the speed limit.

2324
02:11:01.130 --> 02:11:03.710
Cause that's common man.
This Google car shit,

2325
02:11:04.160 --> 02:11:06.890
when they were going to have cars that are going to be there.

2326
02:11:06.891 --> 02:11:09.890
You're going to get in them and you could fucking be on your computer.

2327
02:11:09.891 --> 02:11:11.120
You could be doing whatever you want.

2328
02:11:11.120 --> 02:11:15.620
It's a personal craft that's going to be able to follow a pattern and get you

2329
02:11:15.621 --> 02:11:18.720
somewhere.
You're not going to have to do any driving anymore.
This is,

2330
02:11:18.880 --> 02:11:23.450
it's 100% on the way.
If you've seen the Google videos,
right,
Brian?

2331
02:11:24.920 --> 02:11:29.540
Crossing guards,
cars,
Google cars,
you have it.
Are you serious?
Yeah.

2332
02:11:29.541 --> 02:11:32.300
I would say prepare to get your fucking mind blown.
Google hold ups.

2333
02:11:32.330 --> 02:11:36.380
Pull up on that thing.
Google car drives itself,
Dude.

2334
02:11:36.470 --> 02:11:40.550
Google is for sure skynet.
There's no doubt about it.
Google.
Google is,

2335
02:11:40.850 --> 02:11:45.140
it's going to be one day when when we talk back like the way we view the ancient

2336
02:11:45.141 --> 02:11:47.510
Egyptians and we tried to decipher their,
their society.

2337
02:11:47.690 --> 02:11:50.810
Google's gonna play a huge part in the myth of the,
the,

2338
02:11:50.811 --> 02:11:54.680
the downing of the American society and the downing of the Western world.

2339
02:11:54.860 --> 02:11:55.850
Is that commercial first?

2340
02:11:56.180 --> 02:11:57.013
<v 0>Mm.</v>

2341
02:11:58.430 --> 02:11:59.263
<v 2>Looks like</v>

2342
02:12:00.250 --> 02:12:01.130
<v 0>the car.</v>

2343
02:12:02.060 --> 02:12:04.310
<v 5>What did you,
what did you pull up?
A Google car</v>

2344
02:12:06.370 --> 02:12:11.210
car that drives itself.
Scoot back a little.
Sorry.
A very cautious driver.

2345
02:12:12.050 --> 02:12:16.730
They're like most people,
much of my life depends on the motor car.
Oh,

2346
02:12:16.731 --> 02:12:21.500
she's telling me fast forward this over.
Oh,
kind of fuel.

2347
02:12:21.501 --> 02:12:25.490
It uses the changing something far more fundamental.
When I say,

2348
02:12:25.491 --> 02:12:27.830
how can I say I would love,
she seems like a nice lady.

2349
02:12:27.831 --> 02:12:32.100
I'm just saying that she does have or just join a four foot.

2350
02:12:32.210 --> 02:12:35.430
She does not pull forward so we could watch this fucking everyone.

2351
02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:36.730
There's a couple of Google commercials.

2352
02:12:36.731 --> 02:12:39.770
So let's just say Google car drives itself.
Did you Google that?

2353
02:12:39.771 --> 02:12:43.250
I thing driving the Google card.
It sounds okay.
But they did one of them.

2354
02:12:43.251 --> 02:12:47.180
The one I wanted to show you the leap from search engines to car engines,

2355
02:12:47.181 --> 02:12:49.100
but not for just any car.

2356
02:12:49.101 --> 02:12:53.180
The new Google car is unlike anything else in the road because it drives itself.

2357
02:12:53.210 --> 02:12:57.540
Yes.
Becky worldly joins us via Skype and you went along for a test drive.

2358
02:12:57.541 --> 02:12:58.390
Thank you very [inaudible].

2359
02:12:58.800 --> 02:13:01.950
<v 6>I did.
Good Morning Robin.
Yeah,
you,
you heard that right?</v>

2360
02:13:01.951 --> 02:13:06.951
Google the Internet company has been secretly working on a sophisticated

2361
02:13:07.261 --> 02:13:12.261
combination of hardware and software that could revolutionize the feasibility of

2362
02:13:12.391 --> 02:13:13.860
a self driving car.

2363
02:13:15.260 --> 02:13:16.250
<v 7>Ladies and gentlemen,</v>

2364
02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:20.010
you are all about to witness while the first time on any screen really want

2365
02:13:20.060 --> 02:13:22.040
things to come and your car up tomorrow.

2366
02:13:22.720 --> 02:13:26.260
<v 6>Ah,
old visions of futuristic cars.</v>

2367
02:13:27.040 --> 02:13:28.450
First cruise control,

2368
02:13:28.690 --> 02:13:33.480
then cars that park themselves and ones that helped you avoid fender benders,

2369
02:13:33.600 --> 02:13:36.960
but now
and now it's driving cars,

2370
02:13:37.030 --> 02:13:41.130
self driving car and from of all companies Google.

2371
02:13:41.370 --> 02:13:43.580
<v 8>It uses cameras inside to a spot,</v>

2372
02:13:43.581 --> 02:13:46.650
traffic lights and other things and also uses this thing on the top,

2373
02:13:46.740 --> 02:13:48.210
which is a scanning laser.

2374
02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:52.840
<v 6>They say this car is already driven itself,
140,000 miles.</v>

2375
02:13:52.890 --> 02:13:57.160
She's driven itself.
Really,
here's how it works.
You tell the car,

2376
02:13:57.161 --> 02:14:00.940
your destination,
it plots around,
it's aware of speed limits,

2377
02:14:00.941 --> 02:14:03.460
traffic patterns and known obstacles.

2378
02:14:03.670 --> 02:14:06.610
So the wheel just turned completely by itself,
completely by itself.

2379
02:14:06.700 --> 02:14:09.220
It's not intended to replace drivers,

2380
02:14:09.280 --> 02:14:12.220
but to help them super cruise control.

2381
02:14:12.460 --> 02:14:16.360
Imagine clicking the button for auto drive when you wanted to dial a phone

2382
02:14:16.361 --> 02:14:17.520
number or read a text.

2383
02:14:17.610 --> 02:14:19.790
<v 8>She's,
he wished to drive it just fine.</v>

2384
02:14:19.791 --> 02:14:23.420
If you wish to waste 52 minutes of commute traffic,
go ahead.
You may guess,

2385
02:14:23.650 --> 02:14:26.800
<v 6>in fact,
Google tout safety is their motivation.</v>

2386
02:14:26.860 --> 02:14:30.970
They say this technology could one day cut traffic deaths in half.

2387
02:14:31.140 --> 02:14:34.950
<v 8>Whoa.
He got really nervous.
Yeah.</v>

2388
02:14:34.951 --> 02:14:37.530
He must've thought I saw somebody coming in down the on ramp.

2389
02:14:37.580 --> 02:14:41.750
<v 6>So how does it handle stop signs and alternating turns with other cars?</v>

2390
02:14:41.751 --> 02:14:42.584
It intersection.
Yeah.

2391
02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:45.870
<v 8>Cross walk ahead.
It would be the same probably with,</v>

2392
02:14:45.900 --> 02:14:48.570
with pessary and safety in the sense of using the,
uh,
the,

2393
02:14:48.580 --> 02:14:51.940
the radio signals to check and see who's in front of them.
Who's around.
Yep.

2394
02:14:52.020 --> 02:14:56.540
<v 6>But how does it handle the unexpected?
How about a little game of chicken?</v>

2395
02:14:56.720 --> 02:15:01.490
<v 8>Oh my God.
Fuck that.
She's stepping in front of the car,
but I was really scared.</v>

2396
02:15:02.090 --> 02:15:07.090
My hope was that'd be transformed society to make a traffic safer,

2397
02:15:07.970 --> 02:15:10.670
more efficient,
and also more pleasurable.

2398
02:15:11.570 --> 02:15:12.403
<v 4>Wow.</v>

2399
02:15:13.250 --> 02:15:17.350
<v 6>Well Google says they have no plans of cars to the consumer market anytime soon.</v>

2400
02:15:17.351 --> 02:15:19.660
They don't know what it would cost when it does come to market.

2401
02:15:19.661 --> 02:15:23.890
But besides say you say this hopes to,
they hope this reduces emissions,

2402
02:15:24.220 --> 02:15:29.220
reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and Robyn eases congestion.

2403
02:15:29.440 --> 02:15:30.273
Wow.

2404
02:15:30.610 --> 02:15:33.940
<v 4>That's incredible man.
Because um,
you know,</v>

2405
02:15:33.941 --> 02:15:38.200
you see the w if folks who are just listening to this,
the video shows this,

2406
02:15:38.201 --> 02:15:39.460
this thing on top of it,

2407
02:15:39.461 --> 02:15:42.850
like some sort of a star trek thing spinning around in a circle really fast and

2408
02:15:42.851 --> 02:15:46.870
it's getting well images of all the cars in the neighborhood and where they're

2409
02:15:46.871 --> 02:15:49.060
coming from and it's like an overhead view.

2410
02:15:49.061 --> 02:15:53.050
It's really crazy that this did not seem like a good idea.
Are you kidding me?

2411
02:15:53.110 --> 02:15:56.740
It seems all right now.
It seems awesome,
Dude.
It seems awesome.

2412
02:15:56.741 --> 02:16:00.550
Would you trust that though?
Well,
I like driving.
I like the feeling.

2413
02:16:00.551 --> 02:16:05.090
I have some cool cars.
I like the feeling of like a sporty car that handles well.

2414
02:16:05.091 --> 02:16:08.740
And,
and I mean even like I said,
even not even driving irresponsibly,

2415
02:16:09.400 --> 02:16:13.150
just driving at normal highway speeds,
a sporty cars.
Like it's fun.

2416
02:16:13.151 --> 02:16:15.520
It feels like you're kind of doing a real,
you know,
it's a ride.

2417
02:16:15.940 --> 02:16:18.640
But that would take all that out of it.
Then it would just be,

2418
02:16:18.641 --> 02:16:21.400
you would just want to be comfortable,
but if you'd be a lot safer,

2419
02:16:22.120 --> 02:16:23.610
what happens if you like fucking right.

2420
02:16:23.620 --> 02:16:28.060
I may push on that button and let it do its thing while I do a text message.

2421
02:16:28.090 --> 02:16:29.740
As an example.
You're on freeway,

2422
02:16:30.070 --> 02:16:31.350
<v 2>you look down,
you're texting it.</v>

2423
02:16:31.570 --> 02:16:35.770
The computer that it's running on for some reason just starts spinning.

2424
02:16:35.800 --> 02:16:37.240
You know like the beach ball,

2425
02:16:37.241 --> 02:16:40.630
like thinking about something like as a little free little hiccup and then a

2426
02:16:40.631 --> 02:16:43.720
semi slams on its brakes and you're not looking up and you go right into the

2427
02:16:43.721 --> 02:16:45.490
back of the seminar.
That couldn't be possible.

2428
02:16:45.840 --> 02:16:48.790
You can't trust it that mine is a computer.

2429
02:16:50.520 --> 02:16:54.010
This car wasn't ready to come out tomorrow.
You'll be fucked with vantage.

2430
02:16:54.011 --> 02:16:57.450
I see this car because you eat a cookie.
You're driving those numbers up,

2431
02:16:57.500 --> 02:17:01.420
hits you.
You're like,
fuck this up.
Take me home.
Take me home bitch.
And you just,

2432
02:17:01.630 --> 02:17:03.640
that's the only advantage of something like this.
Well,

2433
02:17:03.641 --> 02:17:06.610
the advantage would be that this thing has gone over a hundred thousand miles

2434
02:17:06.611 --> 02:17:09.980
with no accidents.
That's a credible,
and it's on regular roads.
The,

2435
02:17:09.990 --> 02:17:13.120
it may be that that's a way better way for us to get along.

2436
02:17:13.480 --> 02:17:17.650
I think it probably is.
I mean,
would you be safe,
you know,
doing that if the,

2437
02:17:17.710 --> 02:17:20.290
if the whole thing was wired that way and that's the only people got around,

2438
02:17:20.291 --> 02:17:21.320
I think you'd probably be safer.

2439
02:17:21.370 --> 02:17:24.580
The only problem we would have as if what day the system cracked and we had a

2440
02:17:24.581 --> 02:17:25.940
lot of those cars gold around it,

2441
02:17:25.980 --> 02:17:29.470
all the cars which started going fucking crazy and started doing 90 or what

2442
02:17:29.471 --> 02:17:32.230
seems inevitable though,
doesn't it?
Yeah,
no,
no.
This is,

2443
02:17:32.231 --> 02:17:33.660
I'm pretty sure these motherfuckers got,

2444
02:17:33.670 --> 02:17:36.550
they don't have the car that flies right over you.
I traffic,

2445
02:17:36.551 --> 02:17:40.120
we'll bill you just pop that motherfucker and it goes up 10 feet in the air as

2446
02:17:40.130 --> 02:17:41.410
long they're going to have that rechecked.
Well,

2447
02:17:41.411 --> 02:17:44.200
do you know that was a event originally rather that's what they thought the

2448
02:17:44.201 --> 02:17:45.280
helicopter was going to be.

2449
02:17:45.370 --> 02:17:48.640
They thought the helicopter was going to be able to replace the car and everyone

2450
02:17:48.641 --> 02:17:51.130
would just fly around in helicopters.
That was the initial idea.

2451
02:17:51.131 --> 02:17:52.720
I can't imagine how horrible that would be.

2452
02:17:53.150 --> 02:17:58.150
Everyone had fucking two helicopters flying all night long flying over your

2453
02:17:58.931 --> 02:18:01.970
house.
There are no one would have any privacy,
you know,

2454
02:18:01.971 --> 02:18:04.480
like even it didn't matter.
It doesn't matter where you live.

2455
02:18:04.481 --> 02:18:07.390
You could live behind the tallest of gates in the highest of mountains,

2456
02:18:07.391 --> 02:18:10.410
so and just fly up there and just fly over your fucking house.

2457
02:18:10.411 --> 02:18:14.800
Bid Sai over your house.
You can never control,
you know,
they could fuck with you.

2458
02:18:14.801 --> 02:18:17.140
So he didn't like your houses and stuff.
Yeah,
they could.

2459
02:18:17.170 --> 02:18:20.830
They could just throw rocks off the top of their helicopter at you.

2460
02:18:21.320 --> 02:18:24.700
He on those houses opened the window and just drop some shit on your house.

2461
02:18:25.030 --> 02:18:28.040
They could always be over your house.
You could never stop.
You know,

2462
02:18:28.060 --> 02:18:29.890
you could stop someone from driving in your driveway.

2463
02:18:29.891 --> 02:18:32.050
How the fuck do you stopped them from flying over your house?

2464
02:18:32.210 --> 02:18:36.250
Like climb down a ladder and has sex on people's houses would be like popular to

2465
02:18:36.310 --> 02:18:37.840
do like celebrities houses.

2466
02:18:37.870 --> 02:18:41.530
People would be mad as fuck cause it hear that helicopter and they don't even

2467
02:18:41.531 --> 02:18:44.920
bother.
Like having a guy take off and come back.
No,
they keep it hovering.

2468
02:18:45.070 --> 02:18:49.510
I'm going to
fucking beat an apocalypse now.

2469
02:18:49.750 --> 02:18:51.820
Live in that fucked the movie.
That would be a nightmare.

2470
02:18:52.070 --> 02:18:55.120
Then they'd be have to be more helicopters in the sky that are cops to stop.

2471
02:18:55.121 --> 02:18:57.850
These motherfuckers pull over,
pull over.
You know,

2472
02:18:58.340 --> 02:19:00.700
how would you then make them pull over?
Yeah,
you get too close.

2473
02:19:00.701 --> 02:19:04.120
You guys are going to hit blades and everybody dies.
What if we all have it?

2474
02:19:04.121 --> 02:19:07.210
Hot Air Balloons?
That'd be pretty crappy.
That'd be cool.
That'd be cool.

2475
02:19:07.211 --> 02:19:09.670
That it's sky would look,
oh I said,
well we all had hot air balloon.

2476
02:19:09.700 --> 02:19:12.820
Well be falling out of the fucking sky.
All the ideas everywhere.

2477
02:19:12.821 --> 02:19:15.310
I'll tell husbands and wives should get rid of each other.

2478
02:19:15.850 --> 02:19:18.430
Taking each other up in a hot air balloon and fucking shoot a hole in the

2479
02:19:18.431 --> 02:19:21.430
parachute.
We both go,
you mother fucker,
boom,
boom.

2480
02:19:21.460 --> 02:19:24.220
But we could dress up or hot air balloons with certain designs and like,

2481
02:19:24.260 --> 02:19:27.890
like Joey D's or just have a huge like and will not be by there are design

2482
02:19:28.890 --> 02:19:33.850
monkey or something just sitting in this balloon floating around afterwards
Dawg.

2483
02:19:34.130 --> 02:19:37.580
That shit in Colorado.
In Colorado they have the big festivals.

2484
02:19:37.640 --> 02:19:40.970
I think also in Arizona and Colorado.
I would wake up early.

2485
02:19:40.971 --> 02:19:43.150
It's Snowmass village to go see what they would do with it.

2486
02:19:43.160 --> 02:19:46.170
Then with the whole fucking thing.
We went down there but it was the Jane.

2487
02:19:46.171 --> 02:19:49.780
We were supposed to go there.
It was canceled because the weather.
Yeah.

2488
02:19:49.880 --> 02:19:53.960
We made a trip down to Colorado Springs and God,
the fucking traffic backwards.

2489
02:19:53.960 --> 02:19:57.500
Brutal.
Brutal.
That's bad.
This one lane this way,
one lane.

2490
02:19:58.920 --> 02:20:01.220
How many people are here?
There's a lot of people here.

2491
02:20:01.221 --> 02:20:03.600
Why don't you expand this shit?
You crazy fuck cause of it.
Well,

2492
02:20:03.630 --> 02:20:06.370
some of the shit they just save for the whole Patois.
Yeah.

2493
02:20:06.830 --> 02:20:09.170
Fucking why with natural.
Well,
there's some,

2494
02:20:09.171 --> 02:20:11.210
there's some roads that are preposterous.

2495
02:20:11.220 --> 02:20:13.370
Still the amount of people that are traveling through them.

2496
02:20:13.371 --> 02:20:16.130
For them to be that narrow,
the worst road they have up there.

2497
02:20:16.131 --> 02:20:19.280
Is it dependence past?
That's the worst thing I've ever been on in my life.

2498
02:20:19.281 --> 02:20:24.130
That's what connects Aspen to Denver.
But it closes.
Right?

2499
02:20:24.770 --> 02:20:28.670
People are asking me like in real life,
like,
like,
like they don't get it.

2500
02:20:28.671 --> 02:20:30.260
Like people,
somebody just asked me,
is it really?

2501
02:20:30.440 --> 02:20:32.750
Do you know if there's an olive garden in Vegas?
Like a friend of mine?

2502
02:20:33.020 --> 02:20:35.810
And I'm like,
come on dude.
That's,
are you being serious?

2503
02:20:35.811 --> 02:20:38.360
Like you think that's funny?
Like why would I know that?

2504
02:20:39.220 --> 02:20:42.410
What does that have to do with what you just asked me?
Why I was laughing?
Oh,

2505
02:20:42.411 --> 02:20:46.870
so you were just reading,
somebody just texted me.
Wait,

2506
02:20:47.220 --> 02:20:47.570
dependence.

2507
02:20:47.570 --> 02:20:52.570
Plants closes the late August and it opens June because that's how dangerous it

2508
02:20:52.851 --> 02:20:55.300
is.
Cause that's where it starts slow at first.

2509
02:20:55.320 --> 02:21:00.110
Like it slows everyone else a month later because that's the higher elevations.

2510
02:21:00.470 --> 02:21:02.270
And the good thing about it is when you,
uh,

2511
02:21:02.390 --> 02:21:04.090
hit aspect as you go through the stick,

2512
02:21:04.100 --> 02:21:08.900
it's told it's two lanes but to skinny fucking leads like as skinny as they

2513
02:21:08.901 --> 02:21:13.700
could be.
I allowed by law and this some turns that you a dog that just,

2514
02:21:13.980 --> 02:21:17.370
but at the end of that they have the,
the whatever black uh,

2515
02:21:17.420 --> 02:21:21.650
black wolf and at the end of it's like a bed and breakfast and the lady's got

2516
02:21:21.651 --> 02:21:24.260
wolves and they fucking how at night like it.
Yeah.

2517
02:21:24.261 --> 02:21:25.600
So it's pretty cool for you everyday.

2518
02:21:26.030 --> 02:21:30.130
The crazy thing is if you're on those roads and someone breaks down,
thoughts on,

2519
02:21:30.150 --> 02:21:33.020
it's crazy cause you got to kind of help them cause there's nobody anywhere,

2520
02:21:33.021 --> 02:21:36.790
anywhere near that and it's probably no cell phone service either.
There's,

2521
02:21:37.310 --> 02:21:39.110
that's UC to a broken down there.

2522
02:21:39.111 --> 02:21:41.870
You got to take a real big chance that you might have to take somebody in your

2523
02:21:41.871 --> 02:21:45.020
car and bring them with you.
I don't like doing that man.

2524
02:21:45.050 --> 02:21:47.960
That's a good scam up there.
Fuck that.
Yeah,
it is a good scam.

2525
02:21:48.150 --> 02:21:50.890
People pull guns out,
pull your car over.
Especially have a nice car.

2526
02:21:50.891 --> 02:21:53.180
The pretend to have a flat tire.

2527
02:21:53.181 --> 02:21:56.690
And especially if it's like a guy and a girl and then,
you know,

2528
02:21:57.200 --> 02:22:01.160
they look like respectable people.
Super,
super normal scam,
you know,

2529
02:22:01.900 --> 02:22:06.530
hijack people's cars.
They just found some girl in Vermont.
They,
uh,

2530
02:22:06.650 --> 02:22:08.390
found her body in the woods and her,

2531
02:22:08.570 --> 02:22:12.800
her car was running and her kid was in the car.
It's really fucked up shit,
man.

2532
02:22:12.801 --> 02:22:14.900
When you hear those kinds of stories and you're like,
man,

2533
02:22:15.140 --> 02:22:17.150
he really do have to worry about people,
man.

2534
02:22:17.151 --> 02:22:20.840
You really do have to worry about people out there because every now and then

2535
02:22:20.841 --> 02:22:25.100
someone's in the wrong place at the wrong time in 99% of the people that you run

2536
02:22:25.110 --> 02:22:26.100
into are really nice

2537
02:22:26.100 --> 02:22:29.740
<v 4>people.
And then not trying to hurt anybody.
But there's a,
there's been,</v>

2538
02:22:29.910 --> 02:22:33.420
there was another instance in,
I think it was New Hampshire,
this was in Vermont.

2539
02:22:33.421 --> 02:22:36.870
I think there was an instance in New Hampshire where the same thing a woman,
uh,

2540
02:22:36.990 --> 02:22:41.180
turned up missing and her kid was in the car,
uh,
unharmed.
And,
uh,

2541
02:22:41.220 --> 02:22:43.100
then it turned out she was dead and they don't have a,

2542
02:22:43.120 --> 02:22:45.510
they never found a suspect.
They didn't know who the fuck did it.

2543
02:22:45.820 --> 02:22:47.850
This is people out there that have gotten away with murder.

2544
02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:51.690
They're still out there.
That's,
that's a fact.
100% this ain't CSI.

2545
02:22:52.710 --> 02:22:56.340
<v 3>They're too fucked up situations where,
I remember one time I was like 14,</v>

2546
02:22:56.341 --> 02:23:00.210
it's still like to fetus,
Node Jersey and the buses weren't working.

2547
02:23:00.211 --> 02:23:02.460
I wanted to shoot hoops.
So I walked the Saint Michael's,

2548
02:23:02.850 --> 02:23:06.000
but we ended up staying there till like midnight and I had no buses.

2549
02:23:06.010 --> 02:23:08.730
They had to walk home in the fucking car,
pulled over and he's like,

2550
02:23:08.731 --> 02:23:11.150
get in the car.
You want to ride?
Yeah.
He goes,
where do you go?

2551
02:23:11.151 --> 02:23:12.360
And I used to get off,
I'd see yours.

2552
02:23:13.020 --> 02:23:14.910
And I remember that he started playing with the ball.

2553
02:23:14.930 --> 02:23:18.900
The ball was between my legs and he started playing with the ball.
If you want,

2554
02:23:18.901 --> 02:23:19.830
we come to my house.

2555
02:23:19.831 --> 02:23:22.620
I got games over there and shit and I didn't know what to do.

2556
02:23:22.621 --> 02:23:25.100
I didn't have the budget.
I've got to tell you,

2557
02:23:25.101 --> 02:23:29.540
I was a knock them out and there was a god because at my life,
the door opened.

2558
02:23:30.090 --> 02:23:32.430
I hadn't closed it all the way or something of that door open.

2559
02:23:32.460 --> 02:23:34.700
I just said thank you.
And I ran the fuck out of there and he made it.

2560
02:23:34.701 --> 02:23:37.260
You turn it.
But you know,
I went through,
I could,

2561
02:23:37.320 --> 02:23:39.990
I cut loose shirts and parking and all that shit and he couldn't find me.

2562
02:23:40.710 --> 02:23:42.120
Scary Shit right there.

2563
02:23:42.210 --> 02:23:45.460
<v 4>You imagine being one of those motherfuckers too.
And that's your compulsion.</v>

2564
02:23:45.480 --> 02:23:48.840
You're the compulsion is to go after kids.
Wow.

2565
02:23:48.870 --> 02:23:51.250
Terrible must like when that Sen Dusky Guy,

2566
02:23:51.490 --> 02:23:53.440
do you know that story that he got taped?

2567
02:23:53.620 --> 02:23:55.660
They got him on a wire tap from earlier.

2568
02:23:55.661 --> 02:23:59.760
Before all this broke out from years back.
There was a woman and he,
uh,

2569
02:23:59.980 --> 02:24:03.100
was accused of doing something inappropriate with her son,

2570
02:24:03.101 --> 02:24:06.850
and she was talking to him on the phone and he said,
I wish I was dead.

2571
02:24:07.450 --> 02:24:09.640
That's what he said when they were talking to him about it.
He said,

2572
02:24:09.641 --> 02:24:13.770
I wish I was dead.
That's how they feel.

2573
02:24:13.890 --> 02:24:18.540
What a terrible sick,
fucking broken thing in the brain to make you do that big.

2574
02:24:18.630 --> 02:24:20.670
That's what that thing that people have,

2575
02:24:20.780 --> 02:24:23.730
but isn't it fucked up that the brain is so weird like that,

2576
02:24:23.731 --> 02:24:25.350
that it can do something like that.

2577
02:24:25.490 --> 02:24:29.310
Maybe someone can find themselves somehow or another and that kind of a terrible

2578
02:24:29.580 --> 02:24:31.800
jail of a life.
But here's the beauty of it.

2579
02:24:32.510 --> 02:24:35.030
<v 3>If you really read this whole thing of the showers,</v>

2580
02:24:35.510 --> 02:24:40.400
this fucking guy was pleading to get caught.
Really look at it.
Listen,

2581
02:24:40.420 --> 02:24:43.320
if I have a little boy,
you think I'm going to shower him at the school for Jim.

2582
02:24:43.460 --> 02:24:44.293
You're fucked.

2583
02:24:44.410 --> 02:24:45.990
<v 4>You think about it.
Take them to a school gym.</v>

2584
02:24:46.050 --> 02:24:48.880
I don't think they have any place else to go.
You know,
just working.

2585
02:24:48.900 --> 02:24:50.460
You also had a white thing.

2586
02:24:51.300 --> 02:24:55.530
One of the kids said that he was over the house and he was screaming for help

2587
02:24:55.531 --> 02:24:56.730
and the wife ignored him.

2588
02:24:58.220 --> 02:25:01.670
He was screaming for help when he talked about it,
like help.

2589
02:25:01.671 --> 02:25:05.150
This guy's fucking me.
Like the first time Sandusky fucked him.

2590
02:25:05.390 --> 02:25:08.970
He's screaming for help and the wife just ignored him have.

2591
02:25:09.100 --> 02:25:12.650
It's probably any other room mastery.
Your wife,
uh,
they,
they also lived,

2592
02:25:12.651 --> 02:25:16.250
apparently he lives like right across the street from a school yard.

2593
02:25:16.640 --> 02:25:21.200
So he sits in the back porch and he watches kids play from his fucking house.

2594
02:25:22.130 --> 02:25:25.330
Like,
Whoa,
this is amazing.

2595
02:25:25.331 --> 02:25:28.090
That guy was in that position for so long.

2596
02:25:28.270 --> 02:25:30.970
Maybe if you think the world makes sense and that things,

2597
02:25:31.180 --> 02:25:34.720
things come to light always.
I not necessarily,
man,

2598
02:25:34.810 --> 02:25:37.210
they kept that a secret for a long goddamn time.
He,

2599
02:25:37.211 --> 02:25:39.340
maybe the people deep inside knew about it,

2600
02:25:39.610 --> 02:25:42.340
but we didn't know about it for a long goddamn time.

2601
02:25:42.790 --> 02:25:45.940
That's a pretty impressive bit of secret keeping,
you know,

2602
02:25:46.360 --> 02:25:49.120
I wonder how many other secrets or like that out there,
you know,

2603
02:25:49.121 --> 02:25:54.040
especially in places where it becomes sort of cult like,
like Penn state.
I mean,

2604
02:25:54.041 --> 02:25:58.340
when that guy,
when nobody even wanted to hear why they fired Joe Paterno,

2605
02:25:58.480 --> 02:26:01.840
they just want to turn cars over and light things on fire.
Like you can't,

2606
02:26:02.080 --> 02:26:04.540
you can't fire him,
you can't fire him.
There was riots,
man.

2607
02:26:04.541 --> 02:26:07.980
People were just going crazy and demonstrating and screaming and yelling and you

2608
02:26:07.981 --> 02:26:11.230
know,
they were really mad.
They were really mad.
They just,

2609
02:26:11.231 --> 02:26:15.310
they would never even think that he could have been somehow or another aware

2610
02:26:15.460 --> 02:26:19.150
that is the guy who was working with for years was like kid fucker.

2611
02:26:19.300 --> 02:26:23.500
But he might have been,
he might have been,
they might've let it slide.

2612
02:26:23.740 --> 02:26:27.400
That's some scary shit.
That guy took kids with him on vacation.

2613
02:26:27.810 --> 02:26:31.510
That guy took kids with him to games and they stayed in the same room.

2614
02:26:32.390 --> 02:26:36.070
This is a dark,
dark,
dark shit.
You know,

2615
02:26:36.580 --> 02:26:39.970
people should have known about that a long time ago.
But you know what's crazy?

2616
02:26:39.971 --> 02:26:44.180
Charles was one of those kids.
I went to the camps,
I was a pal.
Basketball.

2617
02:26:44.200 --> 02:26:47.050
The cops slept in the room with you and you know what man?

2618
02:26:47.051 --> 02:26:49.430
I sit and let pick them all that Shit and how lucky I am.

2619
02:26:49.600 --> 02:26:53.590
Nobody ever blow for a week.
I didn't like that shit.

2620
02:26:53.950 --> 02:26:55.840
But it's just a kid like I never really,

2621
02:26:55.841 --> 02:26:59.920
I don't know what that world would be like if it's so fucking dark for a child.

2622
02:27:00.220 --> 02:27:04.840
Any crime against a child,
it's so dark because it stays with them forever,

2623
02:27:05.330 --> 02:27:08.830
changes their life,
changes their life.
It makes him adjust to life with that.

2624
02:27:09.250 --> 02:27:14.120
It's just sits with your soul so much of those years,
those formative years.
Uh,

2625
02:27:14.420 --> 02:27:17.100
and the really scary things that supposedly,
I mean the,

2626
02:27:17.120 --> 02:27:20.350
they're thinking is the people that perpetrated or ones who were victims

2627
02:27:20.351 --> 02:27:21.520
themselves and that's the,

2628
02:27:22.760 --> 02:27:26.830
it fucking short circuits their whole thing and makes them want to molest

2629
02:27:26.831 --> 02:27:28.420
children.
That's terrible man.

2630
02:27:28.421 --> 02:27:31.060
It's the whole thing is they almost want to bring someone into it.

2631
02:27:31.061 --> 02:27:33.610
Like it's like,
like a vampire,
you know,

2632
02:27:33.611 --> 02:27:37.900
like someone infecting someone else with the same thing that they got,
you know,

2633
02:27:38.260 --> 02:27:39.910
and that's how you pass it on.
I mean,

2634
02:27:39.911 --> 02:27:44.410
I wonder how many references and how much of the mythology of the vampire is

2635
02:27:44.411 --> 02:27:47.770
based on things like that,
you know,
that could easily what it would be from,

2636
02:27:48.430 --> 02:27:51.520
you know,
someone who has something horrible done to them when they're younger,

2637
02:27:51.580 --> 02:27:54.490
they become that horrible thing.
You know,

2638
02:27:54.820 --> 02:27:56.980
there's probably one person that started at all,
you know,

2639
02:27:56.981 --> 02:27:58.840
because he was the first person on my list,
a kid,

2640
02:27:58.841 --> 02:28:02.260
and then it just grew and grew a monkey's man.
The thing is,

2641
02:28:02.261 --> 02:28:06.280
if you look at monkeys,
and I say monkeys,
by the way,
I know that it's apes,

2642
02:28:06.300 --> 02:28:09.940
it's chimpanzees.
I know it's apes.
Monkey.
Sounds cool.
So I use monkey.

2643
02:28:11.040 --> 02:28:14.350
You're not supposed to do that.
But if you look at like,
if you look at Bonobo,

2644
02:28:14.351 --> 02:28:15.131
chimpanzees,

2645
02:28:15.131 --> 02:28:18.940
they are the closest to us as far as genetically them and regular chimpanzees

2646
02:28:18.941 --> 02:28:22.250
are closest to the other primates.
But nobos fucked the shit out of each other.

2647
02:28:22.251 --> 02:28:23.330
Everybody fucks everybody.

2648
02:28:23.630 --> 02:28:27.110
The only people that don't fuck is the mother doesn't fuck the sun.

2649
02:28:27.800 --> 02:28:32.210
And I think that's it.
I think the men fucked their daughters.
The,
uh,
the females,

2650
02:28:32.270 --> 02:28:36.530
uh,
you know,
like they'll fuck sisters to fuck everybody.
Everybody gets fun.

2651
02:28:36.560 --> 02:28:39.880
It's weird because you'd think like,
it'd be interesting to see like,
yeah,

2652
02:28:39.950 --> 02:28:43.700
that that monkey has molested this monkey and this monkey has molested and I get

2653
02:28:43.701 --> 02:28:46.640
the one that got molested first poop more.
The other one,
you know,

2654
02:28:46.641 --> 02:28:51.080
he's got a real job.
There's no,
there's no one gets out alive in the jungle.

2655
02:28:51.110 --> 02:28:54.080
Everybody's getting fucked,
right?
This isn't,
it's not like,
it's,

2656
02:28:54.090 --> 02:28:59.000
it's not like this,
you know what it is is just a rampant fuck festival.

2657
02:28:59.120 --> 02:29:02.960
The Banabos,
they settle all their arguments with fucking,
it's crazy gay sex,

2658
02:29:02.961 --> 02:29:06.770
straight sex.
It's nuts.
Everybody fucks everybody.
There's no monogamy at all.

2659
02:29:06.820 --> 02:29:07.100
You know,

2660
02:29:07.100 --> 02:29:10.940
and the were really nutty thing is there's a giant leap between that and

2661
02:29:10.941 --> 02:29:13.400
monogamous relationships that most people try to keep together in the,

2662
02:29:13.401 --> 02:29:16.610
in the human world.
Like that's,
uh,
and as far as behaviorally,

2663
02:29:16.640 --> 02:29:19.730
it's really kind of the antithesis of what the Banabos,

2664
02:29:19.910 --> 02:29:23.020
our closest ancestors do and how they get by,
you know,

2665
02:29:23.030 --> 02:29:26.330
they just fuck everybody and we just try to keep it together and only fuck one

2666
02:29:26.331 --> 02:29:30.260
person.
It's kind of fascinating when you think about it,
but those,
uh,

2667
02:29:30.261 --> 02:29:34.420
those crazy monkeys,
they fuck everything man.
But nobo squad.
Yeah.
I mean,

2668
02:29:34.430 --> 02:29:34.870
it's almost,

2669
02:29:34.870 --> 02:29:38.630
we're trying to get past all that because we realized that it's a selfishness in

2670
02:29:38.631 --> 02:29:40.380
that you shouldn't only,

2671
02:29:40.420 --> 02:29:42.880
she'll only be able to have sex with in our rationalizations.

2672
02:29:42.881 --> 02:29:47.690
Someone who understands what sex is and someone who is an adult can make their

2673
02:29:47.691 --> 02:29:50.720
own decisions.
That's like,
that's how a normal cultural handles it.

2674
02:29:50.990 --> 02:29:51.823
Even though the,

2675
02:29:51.830 --> 02:29:55.040
they want it when they're younger and people become sexual when they're younger.

2676
02:29:55.190 --> 02:29:58.460
We've decided that,
you know,
if in order to keep society together,

2677
02:29:58.610 --> 02:30:02.510
you can't just go around as a 40 year old person banging 13 year olds.

2678
02:30:02.511 --> 02:30:03.344
So it's just crazy.

2679
02:30:03.460 --> 02:30:07.270
It doesn't matter if they have a period that's just shits repo posterous you

2680
02:30:07.280 --> 02:30:09.860
know,
you didn't even giving them a chance.
It's like it's cheating.

2681
02:30:09.861 --> 02:30:13.400
It's shooting fish in a barrel.
It's,
you know,
it's molestation.
It's not,

2682
02:30:13.880 --> 02:30:17.270
it doesn't matter if they like it.
You know,
we,
we made some rational,

2683
02:30:17.271 --> 02:30:18.800
smart decisions when it comes to that shit.

2684
02:30:18.920 --> 02:30:21.090
<v 3>No,
my kids are how old kids are,
you know,</v>

2685
02:30:21.180 --> 02:30:24.690
I can't toe sometimes he can't suppress symptoms of cocaine.

2686
02:30:24.970 --> 02:30:29.310
1616 and 17 year olds.
There's a lot of them that look like women.

2687
02:30:29.311 --> 02:30:32.240
Man Prays level about the Sabbath light before a couple it upbeat.

2688
02:30:32.610 --> 02:30:34.890
You don't have to school over here and kids are question.

2689
02:30:34.891 --> 02:30:38.270
There was a girl with shorts,
you know you're in your car.

2690
02:30:38.271 --> 02:30:41.460
That's really hard when you look over.
She was crossing the street.

2691
02:30:41.461 --> 02:30:45.570
I'm thinking of myself,
I could do something like that.

2692
02:30:45.750 --> 02:30:48.290
Of course you didn't even look at it.
I can't even look at this girl.

2693
02:30:48.300 --> 02:30:51.510
Of course you couldn't because you're a moral person and because,

2694
02:30:53.040 --> 02:30:57.120
but to look at him,
Jesus Christ,

2695
02:30:57.300 --> 02:30:59.930
how could somebody fake?
How old were these girls?
What are you looking at?

2696
02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:04.050
They had to be fucking high school.
Okay.
That's where it gets tricky dog.

2697
02:31:04.230 --> 02:31:08.100
When it's like 1617 and they started looking like women in their five foot nine

2698
02:31:08.430 --> 02:31:08.980
it gets,

2699
02:31:08.980 --> 02:31:13.350
it's almost impossible but even gets tricky even with the trick I guy like you,

2700
02:31:13.680 --> 02:31:15.440
you're a moron and I look at them,

2701
02:31:15.441 --> 02:31:17.730
it would go of course would be a conquest from me.

2702
02:31:17.970 --> 02:31:20.520
Of course being a bearish for a guy like me that right,

2703
02:31:20.610 --> 02:31:24.030
but that's in the context of our culture and the context of your body.

2704
02:31:24.240 --> 02:31:25.680
Your body would want to fuck that girl,

2705
02:31:25.681 --> 02:31:29.340
Joe d as if you were alone with her and you and her were on an island and she's

2706
02:31:29.341 --> 02:31:32.810
cuddling up with you every night to sleep and then she just reaches down.

2707
02:31:32.830 --> 02:31:36.330
He packaged,
rubs your balls and starts kissing your ear and your Dick is hard.

2708
02:31:36.331 --> 02:31:37.770
Like a Goddamn Crowbar.
Yeah.

2709
02:31:37.771 --> 02:31:42.420
She might only be 17 but her pussy is dripping down her leg.

2710
02:31:42.421 --> 02:31:44.520
You touch her thigh,
you feel it dripping.

2711
02:31:44.520 --> 02:31:46.400
You remember that when they were 17 and we're going to chant.

2712
02:31:47.610 --> 02:31:50.670
They would get so wet.
They would gush.
Remember that shit?
Yeah,
you'd fuck her.

2713
02:31:50.730 --> 02:31:51.260
Okay.

2714
02:31:51.260 --> 02:31:56.260
I don't judge oily and I was about 20th 19 I worked at an electrical supply,

2715
02:31:58.080 --> 02:32:01.050
a supply house with electric.
We all took those warehouse jobs,

2716
02:32:01.360 --> 02:32:06.240
but the guy that had the warehouse had to be 48 and his girlfriend,

2717
02:32:06.990 --> 02:32:07.823
his wife,

2718
02:32:08.040 --> 02:32:13.040
I just turned 17 and he had been with her since she was 13 Oh,

2719
02:32:15.200 --> 02:32:19.400
I don't,
that was legal at the time.
I guess it was legal.
He had the gun.

2720
02:32:19.690 --> 02:32:22.680
You have been in trouble,
but he got a pregnant so they had to stay together.

2721
02:32:22.980 --> 02:32:25.740
But he was a group man dating a girl in high school.

2722
02:32:27.150 --> 02:32:30.060
She wasn't all there and he wasn't all there,
you know.

2723
02:32:30.340 --> 02:32:34.010
I mean obviously you could see it,
but just the thought of him telling me,
yeah,

2724
02:32:34.020 --> 02:32:38.700
my wife was 17 or 18 I'm like,
he goes,
we've been together for five years.

2725
02:32:38.790 --> 02:32:39.890
Why could you imagine when

2726
02:32:39.940 --> 02:32:40.870
<v 4>picking a girl out?</v>

2727
02:32:41.050 --> 02:32:44.440
And I like when she was like 12 and they were just friends with her until she's

2728
02:32:44.441 --> 02:32:48.190
18 and then you start putting the moves on her cheese repeat.

2729
02:32:48.191 --> 02:32:51.970
I think about dude,
there's some of them that they're there.

2730
02:32:51.971 --> 02:32:56.110
The age of consent is really low.
Yeah,
like 16 as Hawaii or something like,

2731
02:32:56.170 --> 02:32:58.390
I think that's why I think it's,
well,

2732
02:32:59.760 --> 02:33:03.820
I'll have to figure this out.
This is all right.
Here we go.
The lowest,

2733
02:33:03.850 --> 02:33:05.710
it seems like 15 is Colorado.

2734
02:33:05.740 --> 02:33:10.740
15 Jesus Christ can be still real to be real.

2735
02:33:11.921 --> 02:33:16.660
I don't know what year this is.
1999 what does this Jersey goes to bite you then?

2736
02:33:16.661 --> 02:33:20.470
He's like,
what was George [inaudible] in 1999 Jersey was it,
by the way,

2737
02:33:20.471 --> 02:33:23.830
that's pretty fascinating.
16 and 18 I guess.

2738
02:33:23.831 --> 02:33:27.200
1618 it must mean boys,
girls.
Why?

2739
02:33:27.310 --> 02:33:32.050
For Boys it's probably 16 girls and say,
damn,
that's fucking crazy.

2740
02:33:32.230 --> 02:33:33.470
Or is it girl?
Boy?
No,

2741
02:33:33.490 --> 02:33:38.490
I would think boys younger age 16 if the man is 21 or older,

2742
02:33:39.610 --> 02:33:43.690
the girl has to be 16 if the female is over 12 what?

2743
02:33:43.810 --> 02:33:48.280
12 hold on a second.
I can marry 12 year old,
some of them.
Oh my God.

2744
02:33:48.281 --> 02:33:50.260
This is in 1999 Connecticut.

2745
02:33:50.261 --> 02:33:54.970
15 Colorado 15 that means you could fuck a 15 year old man.

2746
02:33:55.000 --> 02:33:56.530
Just just a few years ago,

2747
02:33:57.290 --> 02:34:01.990
Michigan 16 Minnesota 16 wow.
The most of the country by the way,

2748
02:34:01.991 --> 02:34:06.990
is not 18 yeah,
this is back in tooth in 1999 I didn't knew that.

2749
02:34:07.030 --> 02:34:11.800
The dude from the dude from Los married that whatever 15 yeah,
North Carolina,

2750
02:34:11.801 --> 02:34:15.070
16 North Dakota 16 it all goes down to South Carolina.

2751
02:34:15.071 --> 02:34:18.610
1414 in south myrtle beach.
16

2752
02:34:18.790 --> 02:34:21.750
<v 2>wow,
that's incredible.
That's probably what it is.
Girls,</v>

2753
02:34:21.760 --> 02:34:26.410
14 years old and you're fucking a 16 year old.
Right?
But what does,

2754
02:34:26.411 --> 02:34:29.650
she has like a lot of cheeseburgers and she's like way advanced for her age.

2755
02:34:30.030 --> 02:34:34.150
I still,
what are you talk about Joe,
the meat.
You don't talk about anything.

2756
02:34:34.151 --> 02:34:37.000
You show them cartoons when you bang a full doggy style,
what does that look?

2757
02:34:37.030 --> 02:34:40.810
You don't do that Chili.
I'm just kidding.
I know.

2758
02:34:40.960 --> 02:34:44.680
You have to be the stand.
We'll be animalistic,
man.

2759
02:34:44.681 --> 02:34:49.510
It's natural to be attracted to a girl that has a great body regardless of if

2760
02:34:49.511 --> 02:34:52.120
she's 18 or 19 or you know,

2761
02:34:52.121 --> 02:34:56.050
some of them 17 they look like you remember like,
um,

2762
02:34:56.230 --> 02:34:59.560
who was the Traci Lords?
Traci Lords.
When she first burst on the scene,

2763
02:34:59.740 --> 02:35:03.870
she was like this really famous porn star because it turned out she did all

2764
02:35:03.880 --> 02:35:08.830
these films.
She got like real famous,
but she was underage.
She was like 14,
15.

2765
02:35:08.900 --> 02:35:11.560
My Hunger Games is still popular.
Everyone has to eat that girl out.

2766
02:35:12.520 --> 02:35:15.040
I don't know what you're talking about.
I haven't seen hunger games,

2767
02:35:15.041 --> 02:35:17.680
so I don't know.
And it's all about a girl.
They don't say shit about it.

2768
02:35:17.681 --> 02:35:21.070
I don't want to,
I don't know anything about it.
I went to see you.
Is it good?

2769
02:35:21.071 --> 02:35:21.851
I heard it's really good.

2770
02:35:21.851 --> 02:35:24.730
That's why I don't want to hear [inaudible] Doug Vinson.
Hey Doug Benson.

2771
02:35:24.731 --> 02:35:27.380
So silly bitch.
So we love him.

2772
02:35:27.870 --> 02:35:32.620
Just Silly Bitch Louisville.
Oh Shit.
Duncan Trussell,

2773

2774
02:35:36.340 --> 02:35:40.150
Wednesday tightening down from my,
uh,
my special,
which is April 20th.

2775
02:35:40.151 --> 02:35:43.810
And Atlanta at the Tabernacle.
Joe Diaz will be in the house as always.

2776
02:35:43.811 --> 02:35:46.510
Every fucking show that I recorded ever since the beginning.

2777
02:35:46.511 --> 02:35:50.470
Joe D has been a part of that shit.
That's right.
And that's um,
so that's um,

2778
02:35:50.710 --> 02:35:53.830
on four 20 and Atlanta and the first shows are already sold out.

2779
02:35:53.831 --> 02:35:57.900
So the second show is about half sold out right now.
So get on that shit.

2780
02:35:58.020 --> 02:35:59.320
We're going to have a good time.
It's going to be fun.

2781
02:35:59.440 --> 02:36:02.650
And then I'm gonna release it.
Louis C K style five bucks online,

2782
02:36:02.680 --> 02:36:05.800
which you're doing by the way too with a documentary you're going up doing,
no,

2783
02:36:05.801 --> 02:36:07.920
I had a blue light today.

2784
02:36:07.990 --> 02:36:12.370
April 2nd is presales that I've released the Friday the 13th at the last is and

2785
02:36:12.371 --> 02:36:16.210
what is it?
It's either you or the priest.
Okay.
The documentary,

2786
02:36:16.211 --> 02:36:19.330
I think I'm going to release on Friday the 13th to cause the graphic guy thought

2787
02:36:19.340 --> 02:36:22.270
he gives you or the priest is already out.
It's all how pay loads,

2788
02:36:22.271 --> 02:36:25.810
but people want to buy it on iTunes.
Oh,
just want to buy an iTunes.

2789
02:36:25.810 --> 02:36:30.010
There's people that just got right to the accounts and you are the priests on

2790
02:36:30.011 --> 02:36:33.310
iTunes.
And went that went on one on that Friday the 13th,
Friday the 13th.

2791
02:36:33.340 --> 02:36:36.630
And then um,
mockumentary the graphic guy just called police.
He says,

2792
02:36:36.700 --> 02:36:40.000
take up the other week.
We could release something second as we planned,

2793
02:36:40.001 --> 02:36:42.730
but now we'll just wait for the graphics now what is this documentary?

2794
02:36:44.110 --> 02:36:48.070
He bald man,
I,
I started making those bad flavors.
Stupid fucking videos,
you know,

2795
02:36:48.071 --> 02:36:52.120
and I got great responses and it was funny what people wanted to see.

2796
02:36:52.570 --> 02:36:54.940
You mean the,
the,
the MMA ones?
No,

2797
02:36:54.941 --> 02:36:58.350
just the ones with me go to the weeks go fuck German.

2798
02:36:58.720 --> 02:37:00.400
God taking a shower with the cat,

2799
02:37:00.401 --> 02:37:03.850
the cat that likes to get wet and shit and just fucking around.
You know,

2800
02:37:03.851 --> 02:37:07.210
when people started emailing me shit that they thought would be interesting and

2801
02:37:07.211 --> 02:37:09.850
I'm like,
you can't give people what the fuck they want all the time.

2802
02:37:10.220 --> 02:37:11.680
But I really made sense.
They're like,

2803
02:37:11.681 --> 02:37:16.130
we want to see what this calm guy looks like was like my friend Carl,
my

2804
02:37:16.130 --> 02:37:19.860
<v 3>bows and over,
does he really exist?
We want to see what lubes looks like.
Right.</v>

2805
02:37:19.920 --> 02:37:23.120
Because he really started and I started taking a bat and I want to Twitter and

2806
02:37:23.121 --> 02:37:25.150
asked with donations and I got money.
I got a camera,

2807
02:37:25.170 --> 02:37:28.620
the camera man and went to Jersey and I take my,
my grammar school,

2808
02:37:28.621 --> 02:37:32.450
so my fucked up buddies just to tell some stories.
And then that night we,

2809
02:37:32.451 --> 02:37:35.270
you see me,
I did a one man show us around it.

2810
02:37:35.300 --> 02:37:40.100
So that would put the pieces together.
That sounds great.
Well,
it's five bucks.

2811
02:37:40.101 --> 02:37:41.600
I don't even know if I'm going to charge for it.

2812
02:37:41.930 --> 02:37:46.880
It was just something I wanted to do just to let you know what it really is.

2813
02:37:46.881 --> 02:37:49.250
I wanted to show people that,
you know,
my parents died.

2814
02:37:49.640 --> 02:37:52.770
It seems like a really bad thing when you're a kid.
It really does it.

2815
02:37:52.770 --> 02:37:54.890
It's a horrible thing.
But I was,

2816
02:37:54.950 --> 02:37:59.160
I was a fucking Spanish kid and this Italian and Irish community with normally

2817
02:37:59.170 --> 02:38:01.400
is more racist than fucking retarded.
Do you know what I'm saying?

2818
02:38:01.610 --> 02:38:05.210
They love throw a spic or nigger around and wait,
John and all these shit.

2819
02:38:05.211 --> 02:38:08.570
I love it.
I got nothing against it.
But these people opened up their hopes to me.

2820
02:38:09.080 --> 02:38:11.720
And then part of the reason when I was in that prison,
sitting there going,

2821
02:38:11.721 --> 02:38:15.140
you know,
now they want the people who hated me growing up,

2822
02:38:15.141 --> 02:38:17.210
that the ones that said I was just a junkie,
they want,

2823
02:38:17.660 --> 02:38:21.380
there's a handful of people that fed me and took care of me and gave me clothes

2824
02:38:21.381 --> 02:38:23.600
and never talked about it,
getting it bread.

2825
02:38:23.810 --> 02:38:26.030
They'd bring me fucking full food in the hotel.

2826
02:38:26.300 --> 02:38:29.540
So I just wanted to just go show these people.
That's all I wanted to do.

2827
02:38:29.690 --> 02:38:32.090
That's it.
I don't want to release this.
And Sundance,

2828
02:38:32.120 --> 02:38:33.840
when you got some great stories,
man,

2829
02:38:34.870 --> 02:38:39.200
just mean the actual people's that's guaranteed entertainment.
Eh,
you know,

2830
02:38:39.201 --> 02:38:42.380
when it's nothing,
I'm not going to fucking release that Sun dance.

2831
02:38:42.680 --> 02:38:46.100
I ain't no fucking whatever.
I just did this for these Twitter people.

2832
02:38:46.310 --> 02:38:49.460
We have such a great time on Twitter now and Facebook.

2833
02:38:49.730 --> 02:38:53.180
This is my morning from six to fucking nine.
I'm up there playing music.

2834
02:38:53.390 --> 02:38:54.650
Call them cock suckers,

2835
02:38:55.400 --> 02:38:59.360
enhances us like we sent the home until we don't have fans.
This is a network.

2836
02:38:59.390 --> 02:39:02.870
Dunkin and I talked about it on our,
uh,
on his podcast.
You know,

2837
02:39:02.871 --> 02:39:05.010
Duncan Trussell family hour.
I did it,
um,

2838
02:39:05.210 --> 02:39:08.750
the other day and one of the things that he was talking about how great it is

2839
02:39:08.751 --> 02:39:13.340
now that essentially everybody that were hanging around with like everybody is

2840
02:39:13.341 --> 02:39:17.450
doing great.
He is doing great on the road,
Dunkin is doing great,

2841
02:39:17.451 --> 02:39:20.240
you're doing great,
everything's doing great.
It's like it's,

2842
02:39:20.270 --> 02:39:23.270
it's building down the point where we can all,
like,

2843
02:39:23.300 --> 02:39:25.970
we all feel really good about everything and everything is,
it's,
it's,

2844
02:39:25.980 --> 02:39:29.480
it's like we really truly are like pumping each other up.

2845
02:39:29.810 --> 02:39:33.410
We really truly are bringing each other,
which is really an artist's colony,

2846
02:39:33.710 --> 02:39:35.440
which is what the comedy store started doing.

2847
02:39:35.460 --> 02:39:40.070
We just kept taking it listed this week.
I'm in Miami and you were Louisville.

2848
02:39:40.100 --> 02:39:43.100
There's nothing more than the world I wanted to do was be in Louisville with
you.

2849
02:39:43.200 --> 02:39:46.220
It's,
it's,
we have so much fucking fun,
but it's cool to break it up a little bit.

2850
02:39:46.221 --> 02:39:47.600
Every now and then what's going on?

2851
02:39:48.020 --> 02:39:51.930
That squad is out there and now you're in Louisville,
Kentucky,

2852
02:39:51.931 --> 02:39:56.660
so growers and Fucking Connecticut that's quite represents or not there were

2853
02:39:56.661 --> 02:39:57.560
clogging up the middle,

2854
02:39:57.561 --> 02:40:00.220
were clogging up the old war in the middle of that fucking octagon.

2855
02:40:00.530 --> 02:40:02.060
You know what I'm saying?
We're not against the fence.

2856
02:40:02.061 --> 02:40:03.830
No ball in the middle of the fucking I go.

2857
02:40:03.840 --> 02:40:06.730
It's because of the podcast and because of the Internet,
you know,
the,
the,

2858
02:40:06.740 --> 02:40:11.090
the people had been looking for something that's a little bit more wild than the

2859
02:40:11.091 --> 02:40:13.010
shit they've getting fed on radio and the,

2860
02:40:13.230 --> 02:40:15.030
they're getting fed on television and this,

2861
02:40:15.480 --> 02:40:17.070
there's a lot of people out there that think like us,

2862
02:40:17.120 --> 02:40:19.080
they just don't have anybody else there that are,

2863
02:40:19.110 --> 02:40:21.540
that's on the internet or that's,
you know,

2864
02:40:21.541 --> 02:40:25.650
in any form of media that's expressing things that they're feeling,
you know,

2865
02:40:25.651 --> 02:40:29.170
and people are worried about their position and they're worried about the

2866
02:40:29.171 --> 02:40:30.930
reputation and that worried about,
you know,

2867
02:40:30.931 --> 02:40:34.640
not getting crazy or saying too many things or let's not discuss that.

2868
02:40:34.641 --> 02:40:38.210
Let's not discuss this.
And when you,
you get to a,

2869
02:40:38.211 --> 02:40:42.780
a place where you can do something like this podcast and do it for a long time,

2870
02:40:42.930 --> 02:40:47.750
that those people really get to know who the fuck you are and you really can

2871
02:40:47.760 --> 02:40:51.390
help each other.
They send you links,
they send you interesting shit.

2872
02:40:51.391 --> 02:40:54.630
They send you information,
they send you encouragement,
it pumps you up and me,

2873
02:40:54.631 --> 02:40:56.340
come on,
when you,
when you get all those,
uh,

2874
02:40:56.341 --> 02:40:59.100
those tweets from people love you on the podcast,
it feels great.

2875
02:40:59.101 --> 02:41:02.370
It's a nice pump you up.
You want to say thank you to as many of as possible.

2876
02:41:02.371 --> 02:41:04.830
It's like this big ripple.
When I had the surgery,

2877
02:41:04.831 --> 02:41:09.831
you know how many fucking people tweeted be paperwork over this cause repair the

2878
02:41:09.990 --> 02:41:10.823
repair.

2879
02:41:11.190 --> 02:41:15.030
How many people offered me massages and come to Orange County and we'll do this

2880
02:41:15.031 --> 02:41:18.990
via and come to Santa Monica.
We'll do this by you.
Fucking kidding me.

2881
02:41:19.440 --> 02:41:23.670
Like some people,
you know,
they were like,
dog,
where are you doing PT at?

2882
02:41:23.730 --> 02:41:26.650
I'll do it for free.
I don't want nobody to do that for free.
I pay you.

2883
02:41:26.940 --> 02:41:31.680
But just that thing that they weren't people.
Ooh.
Oh right.

2884
02:41:31.980 --> 02:41:34.590
People hit me up every day.
Like,
how's your day when these fucking fine,

2885
02:41:35.040 --> 02:41:39.120
but Jesus Christ,
how Bison you to ask?
Nice of you to ask.

2886
02:41:39.360 --> 02:41:43.090
People sent me a workout.
There was a doctor that sent me a workout,
a jeep man.

2887
02:41:43.790 --> 02:41:45.720
Uh,
he said that could be weeks Chubb.

2888
02:41:46.410 --> 02:41:50.280
He took time out of his fucking schedule from New York Institute of

2889
02:41:50.490 --> 02:41:52.760
reconstructive knee surgery.
Okay.

2890
02:41:52.920 --> 02:41:56.040
But he listens to this podcast that follows me on Twitter,
whatever.

2891
02:41:56.370 --> 02:42:00.600
He sent me four weeks to Ravi exercises I had to do for that week at home.

2892
02:42:00.840 --> 02:42:01.980
Just straight that might be,

2893
02:42:02.420 --> 02:42:06.510
and I didn't even fucking told me go get a rubber band and tie it and use the

2894
02:42:06.511 --> 02:42:09.780
rubber band.
I mean this is a guy that's a doctor and every week I,

2895
02:42:09.781 --> 02:42:12.510
my g mail account,
every month I get the workout for the week.

2896
02:42:13.050 --> 02:42:16.320
So I was going to PT,
but I was also doing his workout.
Wow.

2897
02:42:16.350 --> 02:42:19.320
Because that's what he specializes it.
Cause he said that when you're 20,

2898
02:42:19.321 --> 02:42:21.840
when you're 45,
you know,
but this is different.
He goes,

2899
02:42:21.841 --> 02:42:23.460
it won't be falling into these exercises.

2900
02:42:23.461 --> 02:42:25.830
He wanted to strengthen the essential parts of the,

2901
02:42:25.831 --> 02:42:29.760
at that age he told me what vitamins to take.
What,
I mean this guy was great.

2902
02:42:30.060 --> 02:42:33.780
This is a part of you that's very nice,
but on the other hand,

2903
02:42:33.781 --> 02:42:37.170
how many people email you about comedy and Sam started,
what do I do?

2904
02:42:37.171 --> 02:42:42.080
And you fucking cut right to the chase,
right?
I'll just get on stage.

2905
02:42:43.420 --> 02:42:45.510
People hit you all the time.
Dog Up doing this.

2906
02:42:45.511 --> 02:42:47.460
I got to quit smoking dog cause I'm going to be,

2907
02:42:47.660 --> 02:42:50.630
I've got to quit smoking weed because I'm going to be a mailbag and quit smoking

2908
02:42:50.640 --> 02:42:53.070
week.
They're offering you a fucking job by you being a knucklehead.

2909
02:42:53.190 --> 02:42:56.910
We're all helping each other out of here and the first time in my life and my

2910
02:42:56.911 --> 02:42:59.400
career,
I'm having a fucking fun time.
I'm telling you.

2911
02:42:59.401 --> 02:43:01.740
They called me for our dishes now and I'm like,
go fuck yourself.

2912
02:43:02.070 --> 02:43:03.990
I do better on Twitter.
Suck my Dick.

2913
02:43:04.470 --> 02:43:05.940
All I gotta do is put on what I'm looking for.

2914
02:43:05.941 --> 02:43:10.050
An active job sub you'll fucking hit me up.
Is half the people on your network,

2915
02:43:10.250 --> 02:43:12.220
a fucking writers from shows.
Yeah,

2916
02:43:12.220 --> 02:43:16.390
<v 2>there's a lot of leg.
No,
no.
So this Twitter is becoming something,</v>

2917
02:43:16.600 --> 02:43:19.960
you know in the 80s it was cocaine.
Now it's Twitter and Facebook.

2918
02:43:19.961 --> 02:43:23.050
You don't need that shit to be part of a social fucking network.

2919
02:43:23.051 --> 02:43:23.860
You know what I'm saying?

2920
02:43:23.860 --> 02:43:27.100
I definitely think that there's the best time ever to get your shit out there

2921
02:43:27.101 --> 02:43:30.640
without having a real ally and how would I show or you don't need anybody

2922
02:43:30.730 --> 02:43:34.780
anymore.
And the group of all of us together,
like the loosely based group,

2923
02:43:35.040 --> 02:43:39.100
I mean oop named us death squad because I came into the opiate Anthony show

2924
02:43:39.101 --> 02:43:40.450
wants with Eddie Bravos,

2925
02:43:40.451 --> 02:43:44.170
a Jujitsu black belt and Tait Fletcher was a giant fuck a gorilla and then may

2926
02:43:44.171 --> 02:43:45.520
fighter and he's like,
Holy Shit.

2927
02:43:45.521 --> 02:43:49.570
Joe Rogan brought in the desk squad and that sort of stuck and we started using

2928
02:43:49.571 --> 02:43:50.404
it as a goof.

2929
02:43:50.500 --> 02:43:55.500
But having a loosely based group or we're all together just because we love each

2930
02:43:55.931 --> 02:43:58.960
other and we're friends and we're all funny and we all worked together and hang

2931
02:43:58.961 --> 02:44:00.250
out together and pump each other up.

2932
02:44:00.250 --> 02:44:04.420
You become a part of something and as that part of something like I really feel

2933
02:44:04.421 --> 02:44:08.230
like when I see that Dunkin is a on the road making great money and then Ari

2934
02:44:08.231 --> 02:44:12.010
selling out in this place and killing them in Vancouver and I see all that,

2935
02:44:12.160 --> 02:44:16.240
it makes me feel great.
It makes me smile,
you know,
it makes me fired up.

2936
02:44:16.510 --> 02:44:19.810
I feel like,
you know as a,
as a group like that,

2937
02:44:19.811 --> 02:44:21.370
when you have a whole bunch of people,

2938
02:44:21.400 --> 02:44:23.800
the more everybody is doing well and the more everybody's happy and the more

2939
02:44:23.801 --> 02:44:25.270
everybody's sort of progressing.

2940
02:44:25.271 --> 02:44:29.530
It inspires you to do the same and inspires you to,
to work hard,
inspires you to,

2941
02:44:29.680 --> 02:44:34.240
to continue to produce shit.
Get out there and bang,

2942
02:44:34.241 --> 02:44:36.970
you're fucking sets out new shit.
You know?
I'm always busy.

2943
02:44:38.230 --> 02:44:41.560
I always have something to do.
10 years ago I'd love to do.

2944
02:44:42.370 --> 02:44:45.100
I always have something to do it because if I'm not doing anything,
all right,

2945
02:44:45.310 --> 02:44:49.210
I want big show about crime.
Last week I did one about criminal stories,

2946
02:44:49.270 --> 02:44:50.290
a whole one man show.

2947
02:44:51.250 --> 02:44:55.390
I already have pages and pages of years have written down shit on computers,

2948
02:44:55.750 --> 02:44:58.020
just a different order.
So when I write one of these shows,

2949
02:44:58.030 --> 02:45:01.300
all I have to just go back to that page.
Why don't you just write the shit out?

2950
02:45:01.330 --> 02:45:04.540
This is what I did for three years.
I just got high and wrote.

2951
02:45:04.750 --> 02:45:08.950
I didn't know what I was doing.
I didn't know about apostrophes,
how to spell.

2952
02:45:08.980 --> 02:45:13.360
They're there.
You know what I'm saying?
Like you forget all the shit in your,

2953
02:45:13.390 --> 02:45:17.780
yeah,
you forget all that shit,
but you just wanted to get the ideas out there.

2954
02:45:18.390 --> 02:45:19.223
Unless a man,

2955
02:45:19.450 --> 02:45:23.200
every comic has jokes and we have great jokes in the log rid of this,

2956
02:45:23.440 --> 02:45:24.640
you become a better performer.

2957
02:45:24.940 --> 02:45:28.990
To think that's accentuates us is our lives and how we put it into our act.

2958
02:45:29.550 --> 02:45:32.350
And if you don't put your life into your active,
you're just the comedian.

2959
02:45:32.740 --> 02:45:36.400
And I didn't know that till one night I was listening to one of our friends on a

2960
02:45:36.401 --> 02:45:38.230
show to her special and he's one of our friends.

2961
02:45:38.231 --> 02:45:42.340
It's a weird different bid comic from the store and he always just said jokes

2962
02:45:42.341 --> 02:45:46.480
like I was doing for years.
I was in the other room and I heard him and I go,

2963
02:45:46.481 --> 02:45:50.110
this is why I'm not successful because of just do what jokes.

2964
02:45:50.111 --> 02:45:53.500
I'm not told them about me.
What would I see with my eyes?

2965
02:45:53.530 --> 02:45:57.330
The world of my eyes by Depeche mode is one of the greatest gems ever.

2966
02:45:57.340 --> 02:45:59.130
They just break it down.
It takes a while.

2967
02:45:59.131 --> 02:46:02.220
The other figure out what you are saying,
what your message is.

2968
02:46:03.510 --> 02:46:06.880
You remember what it was like when you were 20 or 21 you didn't have enough

2969
02:46:07.030 --> 02:46:09.520
fucking valid opinion on anything and I'm,

2970
02:46:09.530 --> 02:46:13.360
Brian is 37 he struggles with this olive.
God bunches.
My brother,

2971
02:46:14.270 --> 02:46:16.660
he already said it.
What did he say?
Said it earlier.

2972
02:46:16.661 --> 02:46:19.500
It's talking about his friends lying about us.
Taxing the labeling.

2973
02:46:19.540 --> 02:46:23.570
Amber is in Vegas and she asks,
is there a olive garden in Vegas?

2974
02:46:23.630 --> 02:46:26.180
I don't know who playboy Ambrose.
I assume that's one of your friends.

2975
02:46:26.210 --> 02:46:28.220
That's a beautiful name though.
She's a beautiful girl.

2976
02:46:28.680 --> 02:46:32.330
Shizam Ooh dog.

2977
02:46:32.331 --> 02:46:35.290
Very excited about this time.
But it's fun.
It's fun time.

2978
02:46:35.291 --> 02:46:38.180
It's a great time to do shows.
We have a show Wednesday to Wednesday.
Yeah,

2979
02:46:38.460 --> 02:46:41.660

which is tomorrow.
Yeah.

2980
02:46:41.661 --> 02:46:46.661
Tomorrow at the Ice House and a there's a show 8:00 PM show at 10:00 PM 10:00 PM

2981
02:46:47.161 --> 02:46:50.480
show,
10:00 PM show tomorrow at the Ice House and it's in the big room,

2982
02:46:50.510 --> 02:46:53.000
which is still pretty small.
It's all like 150 seats,
right?

2983
02:46:53.090 --> 02:46:57.380
200 cause of 290 or 200 whatever it is.
It's awesome.

2984
02:46:57.410 --> 02:47:00.520
It's one of the best clubs in the world.
It's a there.
Dig.

2985
02:47:00.521 --> 02:47:03.110
Just celebrated their 50th anniversary if you can believe it or not.

2986
02:47:03.180 --> 02:47:08.180
It's the oldest ones.
The oldest.
It did plays,

2987
02:47:08.270 --> 02:47:12.450
oozes character.
I mean it's just been around forever.
It oozes it.
It's just a,

2988
02:47:12.760 --> 02:47:15.500
oh it's like a museum.
Like you look around the walls and shit.

2989
02:47:15.501 --> 02:47:20.501
There's like all this like really old headshots and old contracts and old album

2990
02:47:20.661 --> 02:47:23.050
covers and sharing social security number.
Yeah.

2991
02:47:23.140 --> 02:47:25.430
We looked at one of them and Brian goes,
that's David Letterman,

2992
02:47:25.431 --> 02:47:28.400
his social security number.
And then we like get the manager over here and go,

2993
02:47:28.401 --> 02:47:30.020
you know,
you could read his social security number.

2994
02:47:30.410 --> 02:47:33.680
Like I hope he didn't change his and they put up as God damn contract from like

2995
02:47:33.681 --> 02:47:38.180
1976 or whatever the hell it was.
Paul.
Yeah.
All they whited it up.

2996
02:47:38.390 --> 02:47:42.450
I don't think they did.
Yeah,
we read it.
We read it out.
Yeah.
Yeah.
They didn't,

2997
02:47:42.650 --> 02:47:47.440
they didn't,
they took on the picture immediately when they divided it out.
Ah,

2998
02:47:47.810 --> 02:47:52.490
yeah.
But we uh,
you're welcome Dave.
Yeah.
Dave,
he might've just got lucky.

2999
02:47:52.491 --> 02:47:54.030
Dave could have been one of those things.
Yeah.

3000
02:47:54.040 --> 02:47:55.490
Give me something that you found on your show now.

3001
02:47:55.970 --> 02:47:58.520
Do you really want to go up there and stutter in front of the luck?
Yeah.

3002
02:47:59.140 --> 02:48:02.300
You will let him in.
If you had to choose between one show,

3003
02:48:02.301 --> 02:48:05.390
if you could give on one Kimmel,
I hundred percent Campbell.
He's the hippest,

3004
02:48:05.391 --> 02:48:07.460
right?
He's not,
he's just the coolest guy.
Nicest guy.

3005
02:48:07.461 --> 02:48:11.870
Have you seen a Kimmel's million or it's movie the movie?

3006
02:48:12.290 --> 02:48:14.300
What they,
he came,
oh did this thing,

3007
02:48:14.301 --> 02:48:17.540
it's a short seven minute video or something like that.

3008
02:48:17.740 --> 02:48:21.770
And it's called movie the movie.
It's a movie trailer about a fake movie,

3009
02:48:21.920 --> 02:48:25.940
but it has almost every single actor you can think of in the movie.

3010
02:48:26.090 --> 02:48:30.050
And it's so fucking great that now they're showing it in movie theaters before

3011
02:48:30.051 --> 02:48:34.580
movies because it's so good.
Yes.
If you go to Youtube and Creek,
a movie,

3012
02:48:34.581 --> 02:48:38.000
the movie,
I think Kamala has his own youtube page,
but it's fucking brilliant.

3013
02:48:38.001 --> 02:48:41.360
It's great.
So have a lot of,
but I'll tell you why I love it dude.

3014
02:48:41.780 --> 02:48:45.980
Because I have a 30 years ago we'll let a bit was fucking hip and how hippie was

3015
02:48:46.280 --> 02:48:47.840
and how bad of a mother fucker.

3016
02:48:47.841 --> 02:48:51.310
Cause he was gone with the anti guests and that's what nobody remembers.
The,

3017
02:48:51.311 --> 02:48:55.760
if you want to see a great performance,
go to youtube and fucking Rick.
Fuck.

3018
02:48:58.490 --> 02:49:02.580
What's the black do for Buffalo?
The seg,
they're the ones that die.
The cracked.

3019
02:49:02.581 --> 02:49:05.330
We should Rick James on a little bit.
Watch what comedy was.

3020
02:49:05.600 --> 02:49:08.070
Watch what hue bulb was.
What he want up there with a white suit

3021
02:49:08.070 --> 02:49:11.520
<v 3>on.
And he sang 69 times.
Really?</v>

3022
02:49:11.570 --> 02:49:13.900
And he would put his tub that when he sat down with them and look them,
he,

3023
02:49:13.901 --> 02:49:17.670
because that was quite a soul that I'll get Christmas out.

3024
02:49:18.120 --> 02:49:22.710
That's a lot of it was the Shit Jack.
That's been another time he brought it.

3025
02:49:22.711 --> 02:49:23.970
You know,
he brings his dogs.

3026
02:49:24.210 --> 02:49:27.480
He brought up the police dog from Kennedy airport and he's like,

3027
02:49:27.481 --> 02:49:30.420
show him what the dog is doing to her.
Finally he goes,
can I ask you a question?

3028
02:49:30.421 --> 02:49:34.020
Let's put this dog into the audience just to see if anybody's got drugs.

3029
02:49:34.021 --> 02:49:38.070
It's 20 fucking years.
Oh my gosh.
So he was very yet,
and she has now.

3030
02:49:38.071 --> 02:49:40.380
He's all to now,
people will go on.

3031
02:49:40.381 --> 02:49:44.730
There are solid shows or it's not just about people going on and talking with

3032
02:49:44.731 --> 02:49:46.210
Rick.
James got on,
watch the interview,

3033
02:49:46.220 --> 02:49:49.160
didn't promote nothing I didn't get was tired,
man.
Yeah,
he's tired.

3034
02:49:49.290 --> 02:49:53.970
How people get booked five days a week,
five days a week,
30 fucking years.

3035
02:49:53.971 --> 02:49:55.800
You gotta be fresh.
You got to look good.

3036
02:49:55.801 --> 02:49:57.370
You don't want to perform to fucking battle.

3037
02:49:57.371 --> 02:50:01.140
He contract bitch five shows a fucking week.
Look at Chelsea handler.

3038
02:50:01.290 --> 02:50:04.700
What she's doing is rough.
You run out of shit sometimes.
Yeah.

3039
02:50:04.710 --> 02:50:07.620
You know find ways when we only do this the most we've ever done.

3040
02:50:07.621 --> 02:50:11.190
This is like four days in a row.
We did that every day.

3041
02:50:11.910 --> 02:50:15.690
I have no writers sit down.
Your commercial breaks.

3042
02:50:16.210 --> 02:50:21.000
You Watch that live is why I don't agree with Saturday night live is because

3043
02:50:21.001 --> 02:50:23.310
when you watch the end of it,
look at how many writers they got.

3044
02:50:23.610 --> 02:50:25.590
She got 40 writers for this shit.

3045
02:50:26.700 --> 02:50:28.830
I'd rather you have four write a masterpiece.

3046
02:50:28.831 --> 02:50:32.850
You have 40 writers and you still do with jokes about,
I got the Dick.

3047
02:50:32.850 --> 02:50:36.960
It looks like you're going to die.
Seriously,
40 fucking writers.

3048
02:50:37.260 --> 02:50:40.490
This is why I don't get it.
I don't want to stay here.
You're a bit in the deck.

3049
02:50:40.491 --> 02:50:44.180
Is that a poison job?
But I fucking joke that my uncle got big,

3050
02:50:44.181 --> 02:50:46.860
the Dick Blaze snakes where he called the guy and the doctor says,

3051
02:50:47.010 --> 02:50:49.920
you got to suck it up,
and he hung up the phone.
He goes,
what did he say?

3052
02:50:49.921 --> 02:50:52.780
It looks like you're going to die.
That's the third grade Joe.

3053
02:50:52.800 --> 02:50:57.120
I seen that fucking thing.
So you've got 40 fucking writers,

3054
02:50:57.290 --> 02:51:01.710
you know hard.
It is to do let them it every day.
You got to look at topical Shit.

3055
02:51:01.960 --> 02:51:04.830
You looking at government shit.
I mean that's a tough job.

3056
02:51:05.060 --> 02:51:07.230
If he does five shows a week,
you know,

3057
02:51:07.231 --> 02:51:09.540
sometimes you look sad because you've got a great guest.

3058
02:51:10.070 --> 02:51:13.140
Sometimes wonder if somebody goes out of their fucking punk or something like

3059
02:51:13.141 --> 02:51:17.310
that.
You're going to save the show with animal tricks.
It's 1130 at night.

3060
02:51:17.340 --> 02:51:19.230
Well he's a notoriously hard on himself too.

3061
02:51:19.290 --> 02:51:21.630
He's one of those guys that after it's over he gets angry.

3062
02:51:21.631 --> 02:51:24.180
And since getting parents that show socks and like really,

3063
02:51:24.181 --> 02:51:26.990
really gets hard on himself,
what can be idiots?
What was that like?

3064
02:51:27.000 --> 02:51:31.440
We killed and we suck.
I've couple of,
we kill,
we go home.
We can't fall asleep.

3065
02:51:31.530 --> 02:51:32.730
Well sometimes it feels good,

3066
02:51:32.731 --> 02:51:35.520
but most of the time there's like one thing that you're still struggling with

3067
02:51:35.521 --> 02:51:36.570
trying to put it in order.

3068
02:51:36.600 --> 02:51:38.790
Even if you had a great set where they give you a standing ovation.

3069
02:51:39.030 --> 02:51:42.850
If you beloved one joke,
that one billable,
fucking horny on them.

3070
02:51:42.851 --> 02:51:46.790
But I've been with your backstage where you get off stage and you've killed and

3071
02:51:46.840 --> 02:51:50.910
you look at Brian and you say,
I forgot to do that joke just killed.

3072
02:51:51.580 --> 02:51:55.560
But we forgot to do that.
How hard are we on ourselves,

3073
02:51:55.800 --> 02:51:59.550
mother fucker?
I wrote that all fucking night.
I killed him.

3074
02:51:59.551 --> 02:52:04.330
I had him and I fucking forgot the joke.
So you just killed somebody else.

3075
02:52:04.400 --> 02:52:05.233
A big fucking

3076
02:52:05.980 --> 02:52:08.110
<v 2>somebody else who said fuck the joke mastery.</v>

3077
02:52:08.560 --> 02:52:12.310
I go home bound in that car ride on the way home.
I'm figuring out that said why?

3078
02:52:12.311 --> 02:52:16.590
I said that.
Why did I make it better?
And I got a pad and pencil the fucking car.

3079
02:52:16.591 --> 02:52:19.990
Now a little notepad,
which is worse than texting,
which is by the way,

3080
02:52:19.991 --> 02:52:22.330
another reason why you should get a fucking iPhone.

3081
02:52:22.350 --> 02:52:25.400
Cause that voice memos from the,
I got the fucking voice.

3082
02:52:25.960 --> 02:52:27.820
Voice Memos syncs up to your car.

3083
02:52:27.880 --> 02:52:31.580
So I got [inaudible] right off the stage and then boom,

3084
02:52:31.581 --> 02:52:33.810
it starts in your set.
Right.
Incredible.
Right.

3085
02:52:33.860 --> 02:52:36.010
The only thing is I don't know what the fuck is going to go.

3086
02:52:36.011 --> 02:52:40.540
So I put the format is I put the pad and Pencil Right fucking next to me and

3087
02:52:40.541 --> 02:52:43.840
that's it.
We got to rock this fucking closest beach,
unload this mother fucker.

3088
02:52:43.841 --> 02:52:47.170
I love them as opposed to shore.
Dude,
you're the best.
When you up the best.

3089
02:52:47.200 --> 02:52:48.720
You're the best very much for having me here.

3090
02:52:48.850 --> 02:52:52.180
You have enriched my life considerably,
Joe.
Da Da.
Right?

3091
02:52:54.970 --> 02:52:57.840
Listen,
we've had some fucking great times together,
man.
And uh,

3092
02:52:57.940 --> 02:53:01.090
I ain't go nowhere.
I still remember the 20 fucking years.
You are.
Listen,

3093
02:53:01.091 --> 02:53:05.020
I'm done.
I'm not guessing.
I think,
uh,
you know,
you,
uh,

3094
02:53:05.110 --> 02:53:08.770
being with us and I'm one of the reasons why I'm really excited about you coming

3095
02:53:08.771 --> 02:53:12.030
to Atlanta is like we said,
I never did a deal.

3096
02:53:12.031 --> 02:53:16.060
The first special I did or the first CD I did was in 1999.

3097
02:53:16.061 --> 02:53:19.220
That's the only thing I've ever done without Joey did.
But I was the cover.
Yeah,

3098
02:53:19.221 --> 02:53:24.080
he was all covered.
I was at the cover,
the cover naked
CD.

3099
02:53:24.460 --> 02:53:27.850
Usually somebody has a CD,
they open it.
It's a picture of them hanging out,

3100
02:53:27.851 --> 02:53:29.440
smoking a joint drink and it'd be a no.

3101
02:53:29.680 --> 02:53:34.030
You put a picture of me with my nut sack out and my stomach ride over it,

3102
02:53:34.210 --> 02:53:37.670
which only a few people still have that picture.
I have a bunch of those.

3103
02:53:37.760 --> 02:53:40.690
I still have that picture.
We've got a sign of a bunch of those cds.

3104
02:53:40.691 --> 02:53:42.270
I have those cds.
I have a stack of,
yeah,

3105
02:53:42.280 --> 02:53:44.710
we've got to sell those on the road because they're there.
They clap.

3106
02:53:44.800 --> 02:53:48.490
You could blow that up.
It's $147 on fucking Amazon man.

3107
02:53:48.491 --> 02:53:49.960
He can't even get that CD anymore.

3108
02:53:50.010 --> 02:53:53.760
I I to figure out a way to get it reprinted or something like that.

3109
02:53:55.390 --> 02:53:56.290
I don't own it.

3110
02:53:56.980 --> 02:54:00.430
Warner Brothers owns it was my first CD was a Warner brothers CD.

3111
02:54:00.460 --> 02:54:04.780
We'll talk to him cause I would love to get it put on bugs up.
I only have,

3112
02:54:04.781 --> 02:54:07.750
I have a stack of them in my closet and that's about it.
But they're,

3113
02:54:07.751 --> 02:54:11.080
they're like stupid expensive on Amazon because then you can't buy him new.

3114
02:54:11.260 --> 02:54:13.780
But that photo of you,
yeah,
I mean that was a,

3115
02:54:13.781 --> 02:54:16.360
I was a Joey Diaz fan from the fucking beginning.
This was,

3116
02:54:16.400 --> 02:54:19.420
we did that CD in 1999.
You know,

3117
02:54:19.630 --> 02:54:24.370
I was today we took pictures with these creepy crazy strippers that boyfriends

3118
02:54:24.371 --> 02:54:27.520
were there,
puffer them up.
But yeah,
it was real weird.
Disgusting.

3119
02:54:27.910 --> 02:54:29.130
There was a bay room.

3120
02:54:29.310 --> 02:54:32.950
They were that we wanted to get girls that look like they had been partying,

3121
02:54:32.980 --> 02:54:35.230
you know,
we didn't want like the best looking girls.

3122
02:54:35.440 --> 02:54:39.210
We run a girls that were pretty,
but girls that were mileage.
Yeah,

3123
02:54:39.220 --> 02:54:42.400
they had mileage on them.
We were looking for a certain look,

3124
02:54:42.401 --> 02:54:46.310
like I wore a tie and a suit jacket and so we,
uh,

3125
02:54:46.390 --> 02:54:49.630
took pictures basis at this.
They looked like they got run over the fucking bus.

3126
02:54:50.050 --> 02:54:53.740
That one chick's pussy was flat like that.
Like,
oh,
like a fucking,

3127
02:54:53.860 --> 02:54:55.940
it was just flat.
It had no luck to it.
Nothing.

3128
02:54:56.120 --> 02:54:57.510
There was a lot of stuff going on there.

3129
02:54:57.540 --> 02:54:59.860
Their boyfriends were the weirdest thing though.
When you get to that,

3130
02:55:00.220 --> 02:55:03.560
that's sort of a weird,
uh,
there's a lot of dudes that like,

3131
02:55:03.561 --> 02:55:08.250
bill find a girl that's like a stripper and they just like mooch off the girl to

3132
02:55:08.260 --> 02:55:13.030
the heads
of your confidence.
You've done this before.

3133
02:55:13.040 --> 02:55:16.250
Go off days shop how beautiful you are.
A lot of guys don't want,

3134
02:55:16.251 --> 02:55:17.360
you know guys who were successful,

3135
02:55:17.361 --> 02:55:19.520
they don't want the girlfriend's out there rubbing their pussy on somebody's

3136
02:55:19.521 --> 02:55:21.970
pants.
Yeah.
Amen Son.

3137
02:55:22.070 --> 02:55:26.420
So a lot of it is like girls who they find guys that have to deal with that

3138
02:55:26.421 --> 02:55:27.620
because the guys didn't have any money.

3139
02:55:27.890 --> 02:55:30.710
So they have these weird relationships with a woman is the one that makes the

3140
02:55:30.711 --> 02:55:34.520
money and the guys sorta like that the guy was stays home and shit and you know,

3141
02:55:34.521 --> 02:55:35.201

3142
02:55:35.201 --> 02:55:37.880
their luggage when they go on the road with them and stuff picks him up and he's

3143
02:55:37.881 --> 02:55:41.570
security.
Jesus called mother fucker security shit.

3144
02:55:42.350 --> 02:55:47.240
