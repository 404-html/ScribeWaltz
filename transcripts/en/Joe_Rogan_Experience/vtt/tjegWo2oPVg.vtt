67
00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:55.084
<v Speaker 1>cross dresser,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but occasionally he would dress up like </v>

141
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:48.330
<v Speaker 1>He's biting over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I do not think he won.</v>

147
00:08:02.611 --> 00:08:06.090

149
00:08:10.111 --> 00:08:13.410
<v Speaker 1>title.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think he tied the record for most wins</v>

150
00:08:13.411 --> 00:08:14.700
<v Speaker 1>and they had to give him a title shot </v>
<v Speaker 1>and like,</v>

151
00:08:14.730 --> 00:08:15.150
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got.</v>

152
00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:15.983

<v Speaker 1>time 1:17</v>

157
00:08:32.181 --> 00:08:33.014
<v Speaker 1>was the lightest weight you could fly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to give the student credit for </v>

158
00:08:34.801 --> 00:08:36.870

<v Speaker 1>into this.</v>

159

<v Speaker 1>him and shit.</v>

161
00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:45.960
<v Speaker 1>He had a whole choreographed entrance </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he fought in pride.</v>

162
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:47.500

<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

196
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:14.610
<v Speaker 1>I remember one time when we were in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia for fights years ago,</v>

197
00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:18.480
<v Speaker 1>a rampage was there and I guess those </v>
<v Speaker 1>two are good friends.</v>

198
00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.333
<v Speaker 1>So I was going from like different areas</v>
<v Speaker 1>in like this mini group with rampage </v>

199
00:10:25.191 --> 00:10:26.024
<v Speaker 1>patient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time somebody wanted a picture </v>

200
00:10:27.271 --> 00:10:28.104
<v Speaker 1>with him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they put their arm around his shoulder </v>

201
00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:32.310
<v Speaker 1>at any time he would throw their arm </v>
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>

202
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:38.420
<v Speaker 3>get your fucking arm off and were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

203
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:39.810
<v Speaker 3>Then they'd Be like scared for their </v>
<v Speaker 3>picture.</v>

204
00:10:39.811 --> 00:10:40.290
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>huh?</v>

205
00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:44.370
<v Speaker 3>Like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So get your fucking horrible.</v>

206
00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:46.720
<v Speaker 3>That was rapid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was rampant.</v>

207
00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:52.820
<v Speaker 3>People pinch my nipples and pictures </v>
<v Speaker 3>with me pages and so I'm sitting like,</v>

208
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:53.410
<v Speaker 3>so</v>

209
00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:54.243
<v Speaker 1>witnessed that like 10 times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we moved to some bar somewhere </v>

210
00:10:57.040 --> 00:10:57.970
<v Speaker 1>and it's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

211
00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.013
<v Speaker 1>there's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if it's like roped off </v>

212
00:10:59.981 --> 00:11:01.660
<v Speaker 1>people over here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of people in the place,</v>

213
00:11:01.661 --> 00:11:06.661
<v Speaker 1>but it's like a small group like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>and brand pages here and mayhem comes up</v>

214
00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:08.733
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know that they know each.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know the relationship and he </v>

215
00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.100
<v Speaker 1>immediately grabs him by the throat </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

216
00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:16.060
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna fucking kill you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the for the,</v>

217
00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:17.133
<v Speaker 1>for a split second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw all this just split like violence </v>

218
00:11:21.611 --> 00:11:22.444
<v Speaker 1>come into random eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he was about to fucking murder </v>

219
00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.130
<v Speaker 1>someone and then I saw it disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He saw him.</v>

220
00:11:27.131 --> 00:11:27.964
<v Speaker 1>He was like crazy as well,</v>

221
00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:29.103
<v Speaker 3>but like for a quick second,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he turned like just to break them in </v>

222
00:11:32.161 --> 00:11:32.994
<v Speaker 3>half and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that was more terrifying than any fight </v>

223
00:11:35.971 --> 00:11:36.180
<v Speaker 3>I'd</v>

224
00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:38.220
<v Speaker 1>seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rampage is a beast.</v>

225
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:40.880
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoulders.</v>

226
00:11:41.210 --> 00:11:44.250
<v Speaker 1>That head is too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He hits so hard.</v>

227
00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:49.110
<v Speaker 1>Rampage had some epic fights in prior to</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we ever even came to the ufc.</v>

228
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 1>He has the all time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest slam knockout of all time,</v>

229
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:54.933
<v Speaker 4>greatest in the triangle and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>triangle smashes them down to the </v>

230
00:11:58.901 --> 00:12:00.460
<v Speaker 4>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What the fuck was the guy's name?</v>

231
00:12:00.790 --> 00:12:03.610
<v Speaker 4>But he fought very good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A raMpage was in a triangle.</v>

232
00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:08.380
<v Speaker 4>Ricardo arona stood up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He still had his legs around him.</v>

233
00:12:08.381 --> 00:12:11.740
<v Speaker 4>He just picked him up and then.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

234
00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:13.190
<v Speaker 4>this is like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>his name sean woolery,</v>

395
00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:11.713
<v Speaker 5>Missouri.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the reasons why it's so awesome </v>

396
00:19:12.871 --> 00:19:14.700
<v Speaker 5>is because the consequences of fucking </v>
<v Speaker 5>up.</v>

397
00:19:14.770 --> 00:19:17.080
<v Speaker 5>So there's a split second where you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>going with.</v>

398
00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:17.953
<v Speaker 5>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this hill is nothing but your girls did </v>

399
00:19:19.771 --> 00:19:21.750
<v Speaker 5>this on their bikes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Totally do.</v>

400
00:19:21.751 --> 00:19:22.584
<v Speaker 5>I totally put on a skateboard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I just assumed I do it on the bike all </v>

401
00:19:26.671 --> 00:19:27.504
<v Speaker 5>the time and it's not that aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I start going down this hill and I </v>

402
00:19:29.671 --> 00:19:31.650
<v Speaker 5>start picking up speed and I realized,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh I,</v>

403
00:19:31.651 --> 00:19:34.080
<v Speaker 5>I just signed a contract that I can't </v>
<v Speaker 5>renegotiate.</v>

404
00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.390
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I might stick with me.</v>

405
00:19:36.450 --> 00:19:41.150
<v Speaker 5>I start dragging my stick and I'm just </v>
<v Speaker 5>reading this stick and I'm.</v>

406
00:19:41.210 --> 00:19:42.270
<v Speaker 5>And then I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh my god,</v>

407
00:19:42.271 --> 00:19:44.070
<v Speaker 5>I've got to fucking cause.</v>
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>

408
00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.600
<v Speaker 5>when I do it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I usually go ahead of them and check the</v>

409
00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:48.450
<v Speaker 5>car,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the cross street to make sure there's no</v>

410
00:19:48.451 --> 00:19:49.800
<v Speaker 5>cars,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm like,</v>

411
00:19:49.801 --> 00:19:51.180
<v Speaker 5>oh fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't think this through.</v>

412
00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:55.230
<v Speaker 5>So I jumped off and ran,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blew out a flip flop,</v>

413
00:19:55.290 --> 00:20:00.010
<v Speaker 5>ran out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no shirt.</v>

414
00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:02.350
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's great.</v>

415
00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:05.580
<v Speaker 5>This fucking lit myself up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my god.</v>

416
00:20:05.710 --> 00:20:07.290
<v Speaker 5>Flip flop,</v>
<v Speaker 5>busted one.</v>

417
00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:09.270
<v Speaker 5>I bought a glue out the toe of a flip </v>
<v Speaker 5>flop,</v>

418
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:10.583
<v Speaker 5>but luckily they got six pairs of flip </v>
<v Speaker 5>flops because I love him so much and </v>

419
00:20:13.471 --> 00:20:16.000
<v Speaker 5>they just ran out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I ran out of blue out a.</v>

420
00:20:16.030 --> 00:20:16.620
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

421
00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:17.460
<v Speaker 5>Barefoot.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>

422
00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:18.540
<v Speaker 5>oh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And by the way,</v>

423
00:20:18.541 --> 00:20:20.820
<v Speaker 5>the rest of the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Obviously the rest of the trip home,</v>

424
00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:24.330
<v Speaker 5>one flip flop sticks.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Reddit is obviously all uphill,</v>

425
00:20:25.790 --> 00:20:28.680
<v Speaker 5>so I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking why did I think you know,</v>

426
00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:32.460
<v Speaker 5>when you're a kid you do that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did much steeper as a kid,</v>

427
00:20:32.461 --> 00:20:34.950
<v Speaker 5>but it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you didn't think it through,</v>

428
00:20:34.951 --> 00:20:35.784
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The problem is that the risk is so </v>

429
00:20:38.761 --> 00:20:41.910
<v Speaker 5>fucking monumental.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The risk is like end of,</v>

430
00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:46.890
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

431
00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:50.940
<v Speaker 2>where did you get his trailer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gets off perfectly.</v>

432
00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:52.890
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's what you have to jump off and run</v>

433
00:20:52.891 --> 00:20:55.890
<v Speaker 5>off it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>God damn,</v>

434
00:20:55.891 --> 00:20:56.724
<v Speaker 5>that was nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You when you get out of control like </v>

435
00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.740
<v Speaker 5>bottles too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>She got wiped.</v>

436
00:21:02.010 --> 00:21:04.950
<v Speaker 5>The only thing worse than only thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Worse than speed wobbles.</v>

437
00:21:04.951 --> 00:21:07.530
<v Speaker 5>His whiskey throttle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when it comes to speed,</v>

438
00:21:07.531 --> 00:21:08.550
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whiskey throttled list,</v>

439
00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:14.070
<v Speaker 5>whiskey throttles when you punch it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you get scared and your natural reaction</v>

440
00:21:14.071 --> 00:21:16.820
<v Speaker 5>is to hold it punched.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's your natural reaction.</v>

441
00:21:16.950 --> 00:21:18.900
<v Speaker 5>I get that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do that all the time.</v>

442
00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:21.210
<v Speaker 5>We get you want to like punch it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>break,</v>

443
00:21:21.211 --> 00:21:21.811
<v Speaker 5>but there's just like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>

444
00:21:21.811 --> 00:21:23.550
<v Speaker 5>what am I pressing on?</v>
<v Speaker 5>and you jusT going faster.</v>

445

447
00:21:25.771 --> 00:21:26.610

448
00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:30.390
<v Speaker 5>We took snowmobiles into a lake one time</v>
<v Speaker 5>and we this guy nacho.</v>

449
00:21:30.510 --> 00:21:34.920
<v Speaker 5>And he was the first guy to do it and </v>
<v Speaker 5>all they're saying is when you turn lean</v>

450
00:21:34.921 --> 00:21:36.930
<v Speaker 5>a certain way and then you'll go the </v>
<v Speaker 5>other way.</v>

451
00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:37.870
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

452
00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:39.060

453
00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:40.283
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you got to keep it fast and he </v>

454
00:21:41.250 --> 00:21:42.083
<v Speaker 5>punches it on the lake and whiskey </v>
<v Speaker 5>throttles it all the way across the </v>

455
00:21:45.571 --> 00:21:46.590
<v Speaker 5>lake,</v>
<v Speaker 5>into a fucking tree.</v>

456
00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:50.380
<v Speaker 5>Dislocates his shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is the guy showing you good.</v>

457
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:56.830
<v Speaker 2>This is the guy who's taking on a trip </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a lifetime trip flip dislocates.</v>

458
00:21:57.281 --> 00:21:59.320
<v Speaker 2>his shoulder was our first activity</v>

459
00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:02.610
<v Speaker 5>and he was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't let go.</v>

460
00:22:02.611 --> 00:22:03.980
<v Speaker 5>I don't like.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a whiskey bottle.</v>

461
00:22:03.981 --> 00:22:06.660
<v Speaker 5>It's like more like a mental panic panic</v>

462
00:22:07.430 --> 00:22:08.263
<v Speaker 2>with cars too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They say they think they're hitting the </v>

463
00:22:09.111 --> 00:22:09.944
<v Speaker 2>gas or the brake rather than the gas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like eddie griffin and then that </v>

464
00:22:12.471 --> 00:22:14.180
<v Speaker 2>ferrari,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he just didn't know how to drive.</v>

465
00:22:14.610 --> 00:22:16.100
<v Speaker 2>That was a million dollar car.</v>

00:22:18.681 --> 00:22:23.080
<v Speaker 2>enzo took it right out and smashed it </v>
<v Speaker 2>into a wall in a private club.</v>

<v Speaker 2>CloSed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did not know how to drive it at all </v>

469
00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:28.341

471
00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:36.080
<v Speaker 2>No speed wobbles in East Timor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Going down a highway and like a big,</v>

472
00:22:36.110 --> 00:22:38.390
<v Speaker 2>a really bad road for awhile and then I </v>
<v Speaker 2>got some good road.</v>

473
00:22:38.391 --> 00:22:39.290
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

474
00:22:39.350 --> 00:22:40.183
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to crank this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And someone like a moped probably 80 </v>

475
00:22:44.751 --> 00:22:46.020
<v Speaker 2>kilometers an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

477
00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.193

478
00:22:49.641 --> 00:22:50.370
<v Speaker 2>and the garment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck,</v>

479
00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:51.890

480
00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:54.770
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how I managed to save it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was like that lady.</v>

481
00:22:54.771 --> 00:22:57.350
<v Speaker 2>When you start the heavy wobbles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you gotta control your,</v>

482
00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:01.250
<v Speaker 2>you overcompensate every shift in until </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're done.</v>

487
00:23:08.651 --> 00:23:12.460
<v Speaker 5>fun because it really allows you to feel</v>
<v Speaker 5>truly vulnerable.</v>

488
00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:17.420
<v Speaker 5>Like I go in 70 miles per hour on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>interstate in a fucking motorcycle is.</v>

489
00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:20.290
<v Speaker 5>There's no sensation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's no comparable sensation.</v>

490
00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:21.640
<v Speaker 5>Like you can stick your hand out a </v>
<v Speaker 5>window,</v>

491
00:23:21.641 --> 00:23:22.474
<v Speaker 5>but it's nothing compared to like </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking flying car flies by you and </v>

<v Speaker 1>When you're on a bike,</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's an idiot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looked like scotch.</v>

699
00:32:25.821 --> 00:32:27.400
<v Speaker 1>I said for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looked like it.</v>

700
00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:28.353
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might be making up a fucking crazy </v>

701
00:32:30.281 --> 00:32:33.820
<v Speaker 1>motorcycle in my head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I am though.</v>

702
00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:37.640
<v Speaker 1>I think there was some weird cruising </v>
<v Speaker 1>motorcycle that alonzo had.</v>

703
00:32:38.790 --> 00:32:40.040
<v Speaker 1>Dammit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's driving me</v>

704
00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.480
<v Speaker 5>fucking nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But yeah,</v>

705
00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:42.130
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

706
00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:44.390
<v Speaker 5>I did six months and then I started </v>
<v Speaker 5>drinking again.</v>

707
00:32:44.391 --> 00:32:45.224
<v Speaker 5>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's good to reset your clock </v>

708
00:32:46.221 --> 00:32:51.140
<v Speaker 5>the last six months.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like a reset button.</v>

709
00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:54.920
<v Speaker 5>So that time you did six months.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever done anything comparable?</v>

710
00:32:54.921 --> 00:32:55.754
<v Speaker 5>Sense?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

711
00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:57.350
<v Speaker 5>I've done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do.</v>

712
00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:00.050
<v Speaker 5>I can do like a 17,</v>
<v Speaker 5>17 day chunk,</v>

713
00:33:00.051 --> 00:33:02.780
<v Speaker 5>but then the road starts back up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the most I can be off the road.</v>

714
00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:05.180
<v Speaker 5>It's a visual on the road,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on the road.</v>

715
00:33:05.181 --> 00:33:10.181
<v Speaker 5>I got to be dead honest With you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I remember tom being likes jogging.</v>

716
00:33:11.490 --> 00:33:16.130
<v Speaker 5>It's got to be totally honest talking </v>
<v Speaker 5>about being habitual.</v>

717
00:33:17.190 --> 00:33:19.410
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so,</v>

718
00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:20.720
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I remember tom one time,</v>

719
00:33:20.721 --> 00:33:21.231
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

720
00:33:21.231 --> 00:33:23.600
<v Speaker 5>I went out with the staff and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>do you drink every night on the road?</v>

721
00:33:23.601 --> 00:33:24.111
<v Speaker 5>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeaH,</v>

722
00:33:24.111 --> 00:33:24.931
<v Speaker 5>what do you do?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And he was like,</v>

723
00:33:24.931 --> 00:33:25.620
<v Speaker 5>I go to bed.</v>

724
00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:26.630
<v Speaker 5>Not that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

725
00:33:26.631 --> 00:33:27.680
<v Speaker 5>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 5>how do you do that?</v>

726
00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:28.843
<v Speaker 5>Because it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it is difficult for me to go back to a </v>

727
00:33:31.731 --> 00:33:34.790
<v Speaker 5>hotel room on the road and just sit </v>
<v Speaker 5>there and be like,</v>

728
00:33:34.791 --> 00:33:35.601
<v Speaker 5>my night's done.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm done.</v>

729
00:33:35.601 --> 00:33:36.261
<v Speaker 5>Thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

730
00:33:36.261 --> 00:33:37.970
<v Speaker 5>you know what man,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to like these.</v>

731
00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:40.790
<v Speaker 5>I write,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I write on stage,</v>

732
00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:42.073
<v Speaker 5>I'm tall.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I feel like you guys are all doing much </v>

733
00:33:43.221 --> 00:33:45.200
<v Speaker 5>bigger venues than me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I'm doing more shows.</v>

734
00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:47.990
<v Speaker 5>I do not wanna hear myself fucking talk </v>
<v Speaker 5>or think of anything.</v>

735
00:33:48.350 --> 00:33:51.920
<v Speaker 5>That's a perfect time to show him your </v>
<v Speaker 5>wife because that's the exact right time</v>

736
00:33:51.921 --> 00:33:52.850
<v Speaker 5>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you were going to do that,</v>

737
00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:55.710
<v Speaker 5>like you can just go over some</v>

738
00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:59.080
<v Speaker 4>ideas in your head and it seems like </v>
<v Speaker 4>once you get into it,</v>

739
00:33:59.140 --> 00:34:01.210
<v Speaker 4>it's fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing about writing.</v>

740
00:34:01.211 --> 00:34:02.044
<v Speaker 4>This is a weird,</v>
<v Speaker 4>weird thing where writing kind of tries </v>

741
00:34:04.541 --> 00:34:05.374
<v Speaker 4>to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like your brain starts thinking of </v>

742
00:34:07.511 --> 00:34:08.344
<v Speaker 4>it as this horrible task,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like you have to clean out a latrine or </v>

743
00:34:10.931 --> 00:34:12.850
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your brain starts looking at it like,</v>

744
00:34:12.851 --> 00:34:14.590
<v Speaker 4>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't believe I have to do this,</v>

745
00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:17.860
<v Speaker 4>but if you could just get past that once</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're actually writing.</v>

746
00:34:17.890 --> 00:34:18.723
<v Speaker 4>It's really fun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some weird psychological shit </v>

747
00:34:20.591 --> 00:34:22.480
<v Speaker 4>going on with resistance to writing.</v>

748
00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:25.290
<v Speaker 5>hold on just how much.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

749
00:34:25.790 --> 00:34:26.960
<v Speaker 5>I've written the argue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

750
00:34:26.990 --> 00:34:27.251
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

751
00:34:27.251 --> 00:34:29.650
<v Speaker 5>I mean just this idea I've written my </v>
<v Speaker 5>next hour.</v>

752
00:34:30.220 --> 00:34:31.053
<v Speaker 5>What I'm working on now is finding out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so like my majority of writing I do now </v>

753
00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.660
<v Speaker 5>is how do I connect things that are </v>
<v Speaker 5>good,</v>

754
00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:40.690
<v Speaker 5>that don't have a connection and how do </v>
<v Speaker 5>I like a.</v>

755
00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:41.613
<v Speaker 5>How do I close the story?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm obsessing with how you end a good </v>

756
00:34:44.021 --> 00:34:44.854
<v Speaker 5>story and so I'm working.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not writing new material for the </v>

757
00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:49.443
<v Speaker 5>next hour.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm writing</v>

758
00:34:49.690 --> 00:34:52.150
<v Speaker 4>is our.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to write anything,</v>

759
00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:53.433
<v Speaker 4>but if you want to write,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should just write like one of the </v>

760
00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:57.273
<v Speaker 4>beautiful things about writing is that </v>
<v Speaker 4>if you don't have a guideline and you </v>

761
00:35:01.331 --> 00:35:04.990
<v Speaker 4>just have an idea and you just let that </v>
<v Speaker 4>idea starts spilling out of your head,</v>

762
00:35:05.170 --> 00:35:08.770
<v Speaker 4>shit will come out that you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 4>expect and that shit can become more.</v>

763
00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:12.010
<v Speaker 4>But if you don't sit down and do that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it doesn't happen.</v>

764
00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:12.993
<v Speaker 4>You'll have some things that'll happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes you'll have some things </v>

765
00:35:15.551 --> 00:35:16.384
<v Speaker 4>that'll happen with friends.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some things that'll happen on </v>

766
00:35:18.021 --> 00:35:18.854
<v Speaker 4>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's some things that'll happen with </v>

767
00:35:19.691 --> 00:35:20.524
<v Speaker 4>the things that won't happen to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>things that happen when you're sitting </v>

768
00:35:22.301 --> 00:35:23.134
<v Speaker 4>in front of that computer because that </v>
<v Speaker 4>is individual time focused only on the </v>

769
00:35:26.801 --> 00:35:30.460
<v Speaker 4>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not thinking about killing with a crowd,</v>

770
00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:31.720
<v Speaker 4>not thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

771
00:35:31.721 --> 00:35:33.500
<v Speaker 4>making sure that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the,</v>

772
00:35:33.530 --> 00:35:34.363
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the show closes well and ends with all </v>

773
00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:36.273
<v Speaker 4>the bullshit that goes on your head when</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're actually doing a bit or when you </v>

774
00:35:38.461 --> 00:35:42.000
<v Speaker 4>actually performing a set,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you sit there alone with a pad or a</v>

775
00:35:42.001 --> 00:35:43.350
<v Speaker 4>computer or whatever the fuck you do to.</v>

776
00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:44.970
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Or even if you just wanted,</v>

777
00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:50.040
<v Speaker 4>like to do an a tape recorder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're thinking about all these ideas in</v>

778
00:35:50.041 --> 00:35:51.660
<v Speaker 4>a way that you're not going to do any </v>
<v Speaker 4>other way.</v>

779
00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:52.973
<v Speaker 4>So if you don't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean you can definitely get by not </v>

780
00:35:55.321 --> 00:35:56.154
<v Speaker 4>doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went by on not doing it for a long </v>

781
00:35:57.631 --> 00:35:58.464
<v Speaker 4>time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's a big difference in my act </v>

782
00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:03.300
<v Speaker 4>between when I do it and when I don't do</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

783
00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:04.353
<v Speaker 5>But I mean I obviously I write because I</v>
<v Speaker 5>have a new hour that I'm taping in </v>

784
00:36:06.791 --> 00:36:08.840
<v Speaker 5>february so I do right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Do right.</v>

785
00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:10.740
<v Speaker 5>like to sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I do not want.</v>

786
00:36:10.741 --> 00:36:12.820
<v Speaker 5>I wrote a book like that and it was </v>
<v Speaker 5>taxing on me.</v>

787
00:36:12.821 --> 00:36:13.654
<v Speaker 5>Like when I wrote my book,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sitting down every day at the computer </v>

788
00:36:15.281 --> 00:36:19.030
<v Speaker 5>and just typing out an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what I do is I get on the treadmill,</v>

789
00:36:19.031 --> 00:36:23.260
<v Speaker 5>I have a pad on there and I will think </v>
<v Speaker 5>through an a story or I'll think through</v>

790
00:36:23.261 --> 00:36:27.520
<v Speaker 5>a joke and then I'll and then I'll.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's horrible to read and then I'll take</v>

791
00:36:27.521 --> 00:36:29.710
<v Speaker 5>those beats and I'll move them over to </v>
<v Speaker 5>my book and then I'll</v>

792
00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:31.790
<v Speaker 4>well be in any way you're doing it is </v>
<v Speaker 4>great.</v>

793
00:36:31.850 --> 00:36:32.683
<v Speaker 4>I mean you don't have to do it in a way </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you have to sit in front of a </v>

794
00:36:34.791 --> 00:36:36.200
<v Speaker 4>computer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have to sit in front of a pat.</v>

795
00:36:36.201 --> 00:36:37.310
<v Speaker 4>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you want to record it,</v>

796
00:36:37.311 --> 00:36:38.840
<v Speaker 4>you can just record it by talking into </v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

797
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:39.703
<v Speaker 4>I'll never lose anything you're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The idea is just working and thinking </v>

798
00:36:44.151 --> 00:36:47.300
<v Speaker 4>about whatever you're doing and </v>
<v Speaker 4>recording it the best way possible.</v>

799
00:36:47.301 --> 00:36:48.134
<v Speaker 4>For me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the best way possible seems to be a </v>

800
00:36:49.401 --> 00:36:54.401
<v Speaker 4>combination of having my phone right </v>
<v Speaker 4>there with the notes feature on with the</v>

801
00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:56.990
<v Speaker 4>voice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a voice activated,</v>

802
00:36:56.991 --> 00:36:58.790
<v Speaker 4>a voice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever it is.</v>

803
00:36:58.791 --> 00:37:00.470
<v Speaker 4>DetectIng,</v>
<v Speaker 4>translating.</v>

804
00:37:01.610 --> 00:37:03.050
<v Speaker 4>I have that nearby.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just in case.</v>

805
00:37:03.051 --> 00:37:04.670
<v Speaker 4>A real quick,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when it comes into my head,</v>

806
00:37:04.671 --> 00:37:07.700
<v Speaker 4>I gotta get it down because my typing is</v>
<v Speaker 4>not the best.</v>

807
00:37:07.701 --> 00:37:08.534
<v Speaker 4>It's pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I don't want to miss a beat of how </v>

808
00:37:11.271 --> 00:37:12.104
<v Speaker 4>I'm saying something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if I say something into a text or </v>

809
00:37:14.901 --> 00:37:18.320
<v Speaker 4>maybe if it's like really important to </v>
<v Speaker 4>say it with a certain tone,</v>

810
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:20.300
<v Speaker 4>I'll say it into the um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the memo,</v>

811
00:37:20.301 --> 00:37:23.390
<v Speaker 4>the voice memo thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's that?</v>

812
00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:24.893
<v Speaker 4>When you're listening to right back was </v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to work it into a chunk that you </v>

813
00:37:28.521 --> 00:37:29.550
<v Speaker 4>do on stage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

814
00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:30.933
<v Speaker 5>What I do in terms of like getting the </v>
<v Speaker 5>segways or whatever is a try to do the </v>

815
00:37:34.631 --> 00:37:36.940
<v Speaker 5>bits in different orders as much as I </v>
<v Speaker 5>can.</v>

816
00:37:37.450 --> 00:37:39.910
<v Speaker 5>And then you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>instead of opening with the same thing,</v>

817
00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:41.003
<v Speaker 5>what you're open with around and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>you'll move to a different bit and then </v>

818
00:37:43.811 --> 00:37:44.644
<v Speaker 5>also start pits halfway through and then</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just got a crew to shoot two shows in </v>

819
00:37:51.161 --> 00:37:53.070
<v Speaker 5>denver.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so on sunday nights.</v>

820
00:37:53.071 --> 00:37:53.904
<v Speaker 5>So I recorded two different hours in </v>
<v Speaker 5>denver for fruit for what I'm working </v>

821
00:37:57.641 --> 00:37:58.474
<v Speaker 5>on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I'll go through those and I'll </v>

822
00:37:59.201 --> 00:38:00.034
<v Speaker 5>chunk the bits out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then I already chunk them out in my </v>

823
00:38:01.661 --> 00:38:02.494
<v Speaker 5>head.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think we all think probably very </v>

824
00:38:03.641 --> 00:38:04.361
<v Speaker 5>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I Think.</v>

825
00:38:04.361 --> 00:38:05.194
<v Speaker 5>I think more in my head,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I'm a little more obsessive </v>

826
00:38:07.391 --> 00:38:08.224
<v Speaker 5>compulsive and I chew on ideas </v>
<v Speaker 5>constantly and then I'll find a way to </v>

827
00:38:11.351 --> 00:38:12.580
<v Speaker 5>link them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like today on the treadmill,</v>

828
00:38:12.581 --> 00:38:13.414
<v Speaker 5>I thought I figured out a way to link </v>
<v Speaker 5>this joke about my dad with his dream I </v>

829
00:38:16.391 --> 00:38:17.224
<v Speaker 5>had.</v>
<v Speaker 5>cause I never liked telling jokes about </v>

830
00:38:18.461 --> 00:38:22.720
<v Speaker 5>a dream I had said so in such a really </v>
<v Speaker 5>did it really happen that thing.</v>

831
00:38:23.170 --> 00:38:25.000
<v Speaker 5>But it's a funny.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is a funny dream.</v>

832
00:38:25.030 --> 00:38:26.260
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I was like.</v>

833
00:38:26.440 --> 00:38:28.780
<v Speaker 5>And then on the treadmill I started </v>
<v Speaker 5>figuring out and I hop off the treadmill</v>

834
00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:30.550
<v Speaker 5>and I write it down on a piece of paper</v>

835
00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:35.000
<v Speaker 4>that's writing man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now the time you're spending with us,</v>

836
00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:36.190
<v Speaker 4>I just think about</v>

837
00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:38.410
<v Speaker 1>something is writing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people do it by walking.</v>

838
00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:39.573
<v Speaker 1>I hear a locking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People say they have some of the best </v>

839
00:38:40.841 --> 00:38:44.710
<v Speaker 1>ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They walk with stature on the treadmill.</v>

840
00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:46.080
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about like in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood.</v>

841
00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:46.651
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

842
00:38:46.651 --> 00:38:47.484
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just do it.</v>

843
00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:48.903
<v Speaker 1>I do it like at a four for like at least</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 minutes and just with that notepad </v>

844
00:38:51.681 --> 00:38:52.514
<v Speaker 1>and I just write it down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking for something I learned in New </v>

845
00:38:55.200 --> 00:38:56.440
<v Speaker 1>York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would trigger the way I fall.</v>

846
00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:58.270
<v Speaker 1>Changes your sites where you look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>different things.</v>

847
00:38:58.271 --> 00:39:00.430
<v Speaker 1>So like a hardware store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you make your mind wandered or</v>

848
00:39:00.431 --> 00:39:01.061
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

849
00:39:01.061 --> 00:39:04.090
<v Speaker 1>that's why I think they tried to get you</v>
<v Speaker 1>to go outside and do it.</v>

850
00:39:04.091 --> 00:39:04.924
<v Speaker 1>Like go on a hike and then when you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>done that a long time pop into your </v>

851
00:39:08.291 --> 00:39:10.450
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Walking is great for clarity.</v>

852
00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:12.580
<v Speaker 1>Like you think a lot of people though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

853
00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:15.670
<v Speaker 1>Physically and then they'll think about </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they wrote when they go on a walk.</v>

854
00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:16.730
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

855
00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:17.613
<v Speaker 1>I've walked a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a really good writing session and </v>

856
00:39:18.751 --> 00:39:20.890
<v Speaker 1>walking through it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Target like just walking up and down the</v>

857
00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:21.733
<v Speaker 1>aisles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you get to see people interact and </v>

858
00:39:25.781 --> 00:39:26.614
<v Speaker 1>you're allowed to mishear things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I mishear things that those are </v>

859
00:39:29.891 --> 00:39:32.050
<v Speaker 1>sometimes the funniest fucking things in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

860
00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:34.663
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about what your current </v>

861
00:39:35.501 --> 00:39:37.630
<v Speaker 1>drinking statuses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but like,</v>

862
00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:38.673
<v Speaker 1>because to get into the approach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you recap like what an average week </v>

863
00:39:41.891 --> 00:39:42.700
<v Speaker 1>is like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

864
00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:43.533
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

865
00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:44.230
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

866
00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:45.550
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't an intervention.</v>

867
00:39:45.551 --> 00:39:46.910
<v Speaker 1>We're all friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

868
00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:49.433
<v Speaker 1>Your friends though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was nervous about doing this for that </v>

869
00:39:51.551 --> 00:39:52.480
<v Speaker 1>very reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was thinking,</v>

870
00:39:52.481 --> 00:39:53.314
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did I suggest no booze for 90 days </v>

871
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:59.140
<v Speaker 1>because I didn't think you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly do it.</v>

872
00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:00.130
<v Speaker 1>Use adjusted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adjusted?</v>

875
00:40:02.060 --> 00:40:02.893
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll read the chat thread taxed because </v>

876
00:40:04.811 --> 00:40:07.720
<v Speaker 1>it is funny and I will say already is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sea was the best.</v>

<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

886
00:40:31.601 --> 00:40:36.010
<v Speaker 1>same time it took us to do a podcast.</v>

887
00:40:36.011 --> 00:40:37.220
<v Speaker 1>he thought it was going to do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>marathon.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Such stupid.</v>

893
00:40:50.991 --> 00:40:54.030
<v Speaker 1>It's just so such a delusional </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective on physical fitness.</v>

894
00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:57.180
<v Speaker 1>Here we go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like to run a five hour marathon.</v>

895
00:40:57.181 --> 00:40:59.330
<v Speaker 1>I'd be super impressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who that could do that easy.</v>

896
00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:01.700
<v Speaker 1>So you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hurt.</v>

897
00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:04.760
<v Speaker 1>You can't run a marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Easy.</v>

898
00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:06.540
<v Speaker 1>You can't run a marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Easy.</v>

899
00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:07.351
<v Speaker 1>But you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can.</v>

900
00:41:07.351 --> 00:41:11.460
<v Speaker 1>I tell you the one thing that you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to run a marathon.</v>

901
00:41:11.461 --> 00:41:13.140
<v Speaker 1>You can't run a marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Easy.</v>

902
00:41:13.890 --> 00:41:16.140
<v Speaker 1>Fifty five months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five hours is easy.</v>

903
00:41:16.170 --> 00:41:17.003
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

904
00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:24.960
<v Speaker 1>I have a scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's put it back right now and how much</v>

905
00:41:24.961 --> 00:41:25.794
<v Speaker 1>I weigh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scale,</v>

906
00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:30.280
<v Speaker 1>scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I weighed 222 pounds.</v>

907
00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:32.900
<v Speaker 1>These are just numbers is my point,</v>

908
00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:36.800
<v Speaker 2>but not as bad as he looked before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

910
00:41:38.730 --> 00:41:38.931
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

911
00:41:38.931 --> 00:41:40.580

<v Speaker 2>but you've never run a marathon.</v>

912
00:41:40.610 --> 00:41:43.550
<v Speaker 2>I've never run a marathon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can't run a marathon easy because</v>

913
00:41:43.551 --> 00:41:47.270
<v Speaker 2>it's preposterous I've ever run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're not looking at a tv like off</v>

914
00:41:47.271 --> 00:41:48.104
<v Speaker 2>a treadmill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I haven't done the street running a </v>

915
00:41:49.581 --> 00:41:54.581
<v Speaker 2>really long time talking fake running </v>
<v Speaker 2>your fake running on a machine that does</v>

916
00:41:55.521 --> 00:41:56.730
<v Speaker 2>have to work for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's there.</v>

918
00:41:59.631 --> 00:42:04.580
<v Speaker 2>exactly what would happen in a marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You would hit mile.</v>

919
00:42:04.581 --> 00:42:05.590
<v Speaker 2>What do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think it goes?</v>

<v Speaker 2>for.</v>

922
00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:12.200

00:42:12.310 --> 00:42:12.740
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

<v Speaker 2>let's do.</v>

928
00:42:18.861 --> 00:42:20.530
<v Speaker 2>Let's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's double up on this double.</v>

929
00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:21.260
<v Speaker 2>Let's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's.</v>

930
00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:24.200
<v Speaker 2>Let's figure out a drinking bet one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then let's figure out a marathon bet.</v>

931
00:42:24.670 --> 00:42:25.980
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will.</v>

932
00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:27.433
<v Speaker 2>I just texted with a guy the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my buddy calvin from calvin show and </v>

933
00:42:30.081 --> 00:42:31.220
<v Speaker 2>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can run 12 miles,</v>

934
00:42:31.221 --> 00:42:34.640
<v Speaker 2>you can definitely run a marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's way longer,</v>

935
00:42:34.930 --> 00:42:35.763
<v Speaker 2>but wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this all started because you guys did </v>

936
00:42:36.631 --> 00:42:37.820
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Speak is you can.</v>

937
00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:39.920
<v Speaker 2>You can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>

938
00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:40.843
<v Speaker 2>is it easy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's not a fucking chance in the </v>

939
00:42:42.471 --> 00:42:44.930
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You saying I could run a marathon.</v>

940
00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:49.960
<v Speaker 2>easy is an accurate statement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can give me a five hour marathon.</v>

941
00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:53.213
<v Speaker 2>It's burt is not a statement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to do when you're 285 pounds </v>

942
00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:58.393
<v Speaker 2>and you're out there.</v>

943
00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:08.510
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>listen,</v>

944
00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:12.490
<v Speaker 2>you fucking heard that and got so </v>
<v Speaker 2>excited.</v>

945
00:43:16.650 --> 00:43:18.780
<v Speaker 2>This all started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to tell,</v>

946
00:43:18.781 --> 00:43:19.650
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You ready to do.</v>

947
00:43:19.651 --> 00:43:20.484
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to concede that it's </v>

948
00:43:21.631 --> 00:43:24.360
<v Speaker 2>hard to do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely hard to do so,</v>

949
00:43:24.590 --> 00:43:28.800
<v Speaker 2>but you for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>definitely want to marathon.</v>

950
00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:30.620
<v Speaker 2>That's what you mean by easy for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

951
00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:35.680
<v Speaker 2>Why do you think you can definitely run </v>
<v Speaker 2>every time funny,</v>

952
00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:38.270
<v Speaker 2>a treadmill on the treadmill moves </v>
<v Speaker 2>towards you.</v>

953
00:43:38.271 --> 00:43:39.104
<v Speaker 2>Get your legs up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get off and stopped to write stuff </v>

954
00:43:41.670 --> 00:43:43.590
<v Speaker 2>that's running.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're lifting your legs up,</v>

955
00:43:43.591 --> 00:43:44.424
<v Speaker 2>but It's moving towards the treble.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keeps going while you're off making a </v>

956
00:43:45.991 --> 00:43:46.824
<v Speaker 2>fucking tito's and soda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you do what you do a couple miles </v>

957
00:43:51.391 --> 00:43:52.440
<v Speaker 2>and you run?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Walk.</v>

958
00:43:52.610 --> 00:43:53.443
<v Speaker 2>I do run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Walk.</v>

959
00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:56.730
<v Speaker 2>I walk a quarter mile.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I run three quarters of a mile,</v>

960
00:43:56.731 --> 00:43:59.370
<v Speaker 2>quarter mile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jesus to get my heart rate up and down.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Fucking marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You walk a quarter,</v>

962
00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:02.230
<v Speaker 2>let's get my heart rate up.</v>

963
00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:03.540
<v Speaker 2>I'll walk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>run,</v>

964
00:44:03.570 --> 00:44:04.171
<v Speaker 2>walk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>run.</v>

965
00:44:04.171 --> 00:44:06.080
<v Speaker 2>One quarter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when you run sprints,</v>

966
00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:08.270
<v Speaker 2>run three quarters of a mile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>walk a quarter,</v>

967
00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:09.213
<v Speaker 2>five feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then he the breaks and drinks box </v>

968
00:44:13.741 --> 00:44:14.574

<v Speaker 2>So this is one of the new aluminum man </v>

969
00:44:17.190 --> 00:44:19.980
<v Speaker 2>box wine thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Set up on his treadmill.</v>

973
00:44:28.190 --> 00:44:29.023
<v Speaker 2>Good mood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No plan seems to be a good or something </v>

974
00:44:32.730 --> 00:44:34.650
<v Speaker 2>online for your treadmill you need </v>
<v Speaker 2>above.</v>

975
00:44:34.651 --> 00:44:38.100

<v Speaker 2>drink while you're running a.</v>

976
00:44:38.250 --> 00:44:40.960
<v Speaker 2>Somebody with a rubber attached to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This all started because a,</v>

977
00:44:41.010 --> 00:44:42.780
<v Speaker 2>the guy you guys are claiming that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not a runner.</v>

978
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:46.320
<v Speaker 2>Had a profile written in about him on </v>
<v Speaker 2>runner's world.</v>

979
00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:47.583
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

00:44:47.610 --> 00:44:48.443
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't matter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all the photos on to red would </v>

981
00:44:53.011 --> 00:44:56.580
<v Speaker 2>write a profile about how he hates </v>
<v Speaker 2>running demons.</v>

982
00:44:57.210 --> 00:44:58.043
<v Speaker 2>You're better than him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He'll write a whole story about how you </v>

983
00:44:59.511 --> 00:45:03.000
<v Speaker 2>are definitely better than him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm gonna still out running in terms</v>

984
00:45:03.001 --> 00:45:03.834
<v Speaker 2>of the average marathon times.</v>

985
00:45:06.471 --> 00:45:09.470
<v Speaker 2>slash 20.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't do the finishing time and it's a</v>

<v Speaker 2>marathon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is super hard.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You can't say you're in really good </v>

995
00:45:36.511 --> 00:45:38.550
<v Speaker 2>shape when you were attempting to say </v>

<v Speaker 2>your feet up.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree on that.</v>

1005

<v Speaker 2>you know why?</v>

1012
00:46:19.351 --> 00:46:22.410
<v Speaker 2>Because I know actual people that are in</v>
<v Speaker 2>really good shape.</v>

1013
00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:23.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

1015
00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:25.993
<v Speaker 2>Now I'll listen to the important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you're discussing all these like </v>

1016
00:46:32.320 --> 00:46:34.710
<v Speaker 2>baby,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just like I ran.</v>

1017
00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:39.770
<v Speaker 2>I ran a five k drunk one time and go </v>
<v Speaker 2>half of the fucking field trauma.</v>

1018
00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:44.370
<v Speaker 2>We thought it was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1019
00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:46.010
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>you told me about so and so what?</v>

1020
00:46:46.070 --> 00:46:49.470
<v Speaker 2>But I beat half of the fucking field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now those are the same people,</v>

1021
00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:54.210
<v Speaker 2>but the people drink and they came there</v>
<v Speaker 2>for a radio station to pub crawl.</v>

1022
00:46:54.240 --> 00:46:55.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them are actually elite athletes.</v>

1023
00:46:55.890 --> 00:46:56.723
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't a pub crawl.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was an actual five k that I thought </v>

1024
00:46:58.711 --> 00:47:01.230
<v Speaker 2>was a pub crawl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I drank five beers before it thinking</v>

1025
00:47:01.231 --> 00:47:05.440
<v Speaker 2>we'd be draining and it was a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>five k and I beat half the fucking.</v>

1026
00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:07.500
<v Speaker 2>Can I say something?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a.</v>

1027
00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:09.340
<v Speaker 2>It's over three miles because I'm a </v>
<v Speaker 2>runner.</v>

1028
00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:12.390
<v Speaker 2>when you say you're in good shape,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

1029
00:47:12.540 --> 00:47:15.570
<v Speaker 2>Literally the shape of you is bad.</v>

1030
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:19.700
<v Speaker 2>I'll take away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're all gonna.</v>

1031
00:47:19.710 --> 00:47:20.880
<v Speaker 2>Have different versions of what we </v>
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>

1032
00:47:20.881 --> 00:47:24.000
<v Speaker 2>Good shape and you can't have a low bar </v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're talking about reality.</v>

1033
00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:28.680
<v Speaker 2>You're not allowed a little bar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you talk about things like shape.</v>

1034
00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:30.100
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cannot run.</v>

1035
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:32.260
<v Speaker 2>I could by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't.</v>

1036
00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:35.740
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't believe I'm fucking.</v>

1037
00:47:35.900 --> 00:47:37.330
<v Speaker 2>I just got off the treadmill this </v>
<v Speaker 2>morning.</v>

1038
00:47:37.331 --> 00:47:38.164
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe I should take a video and show </v>

1039
00:47:38.651 --> 00:47:39.484
<v Speaker 2>them what I'm running.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You passed out drunk there and then </v>

00:47:40.901 --> 00:47:42.590
<v Speaker 2>granted it's a treadmill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not trail.</v>

1041
00:47:42.591 --> 00:47:43.424
<v Speaker 2>This trail,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you run this three miles this </v>

1042
00:47:45.551 --> 00:47:46.780
<v Speaker 2>morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I was,</v>

1043
00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:47.723
<v Speaker 2>we had to drain our pool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no benefit whatsoever to </v>

1044
00:47:50.561 --> 00:47:53.900
<v Speaker 2>exaggerating fitness levels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not at that level,</v>

1045
00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:57.310
<v Speaker 2>but there's an ego issue when people do </v>
<v Speaker 2>it and you just can't do it,</v>

1046
00:47:57.550 --> 00:47:58.900
<v Speaker 2>but you can't say I'm in great shape.</v>

1047
00:47:58.930 --> 00:48:00.820
<v Speaker 2>There's no fucking way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're in great shape.</v>

1048
00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:01.813
<v Speaker 2>It's really not possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you are in good shape for somebody </v>

1049
00:48:04.301 --> 00:48:07.870
<v Speaker 2>that's in terrible shape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I agree with that.</v>

1050
00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:09.370
<v Speaker 2>Agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Agree with that.</v>

1051
00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:10.970
<v Speaker 2>And the other thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1052
00:48:10.971 --> 00:48:12.910
<v Speaker 2>like you do stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you're active,</v>

1053
00:48:12.911 --> 00:48:14.140
<v Speaker 2>you definitely do stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1054
00:48:14.141 --> 00:48:14.974
<v Speaker 2>Yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we could get you to do those things </v>

1055
00:48:16.330 --> 00:48:17.163
<v Speaker 2>and not drink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would be in a measurably healthier </v>

1056
00:48:20.561 --> 00:48:22.810
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It'd be 100 percent.</v>

1057
00:48:22.811 --> 00:48:25.780
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that that would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that you had wanted to do that</v>

1058
00:48:25.781 --> 00:48:28.030
<v Speaker 2>guy burt and shape?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Their weight,</v>

1060

<v Speaker 2>that you're pretty fit.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Runner's world could run a marathon.</v>

<v Speaker 2>four times a week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm running.</v>

1101
00:50:31.860 --> 00:50:32.960
<v Speaker 2>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me ask you something.</v>

1102
00:50:32.961 --> 00:50:35.600
<v Speaker 2>Shoot.</v>

1105
00:50:43.110 --> 00:50:43.943
<v Speaker 2>That's an important thing to decide </v>
<v Speaker 2>which one you proposed from tuesday a </v>

1106
00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:49.610
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I do not know if it would be a marathon.</v>

1121
00:51:33.500 --> 00:51:34.333
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have to put a lot of time into </v>

1122
00:51:36.351 --> 00:51:37.310
<v Speaker 2>running.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I put.</v>

1125
00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:40.753
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So another idea I had that I pitched to </v>

1126
00:51:42.681 --> 00:51:43.514
<v Speaker 2>you a little while ago was what if we </v>
<v Speaker 2>did a one day decathlon style event </v>

1127
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:50.023
<v Speaker 2>where it's multiple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you have like seven different </v>

1128
00:51:52.221 --> 00:51:53.430
<v Speaker 2>things you do is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

1129
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:54.343
<v Speaker 2>I will tell you that I bike around a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>so when we get into cath lab thing then </v>

1130
00:51:59.711 --> 00:52:00.544
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you would have no chance of still </v>

1131
00:52:01.461 --> 00:52:02.960
<v Speaker 2>finishing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Still even finishing.</v>

1132
00:52:03.850 --> 00:52:04.683
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorta like putt putt was one of the </v>

1133
00:52:06.831 --> 00:52:08.660
<v Speaker 2>events.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd have something heavy there.</v>

1134
00:52:08.661 --> 00:52:11.640
<v Speaker 2>So you couldn't do that and then I don't</v>
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>

1135
00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:13.210
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe though you dominate.</v>

<v Speaker 2>so we all have to drink.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Take it on the chin.</v>

1142
00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:33.380
<v Speaker 2>This reality here,</v>

<v Speaker 2>something physical,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some type of physical competition,</v>

1147
00:52:47.090 --> 00:52:50.090
<v Speaker 2>and then how long we're going to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>totally sober for.</v>

1148
00:52:50.091 --> 00:52:51.350
<v Speaker 2>You were saying 90 days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

<v Speaker 2>Thank you for quitting.</v>

1154
00:53:04.341 --> 00:53:07.910

<v Speaker 2>ridiculous statements and whatever,</v>

1155
00:53:07.911 --> 00:53:11.690
<v Speaker 2>we think everyone's going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whatever we agreed to,</v>

1156
00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:14.060
<v Speaker 2>you're definitely going to be wearing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>scram cam.</v>

1157
00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:15.373
<v Speaker 2>What's the scram?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Continuous continuous alcohol </v>

1158
00:53:17.361 --> 00:53:22.361
<v Speaker 2>monitoring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everybody else is on the honor code,</v>

1159
00:53:22.671 --> 00:53:26.010
<v Speaker 2>but bert has to wear a scram.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

1160
00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:30.860
<v Speaker 4>for high risk offenders because you get </v>
<v Speaker 4>one,</v>

1161
00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:35.960
<v Speaker 4>of course you cops that listen,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that would hook us sweating profusely.</v>

1162
00:53:40.110 --> 00:53:43.470
<v Speaker 4>If you fail the alcohol part,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the bed is over.</v>

1163
00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:45.990
<v Speaker 4>There's no more competition otherwise it</v>
<v Speaker 4>has no stake,</v>

1164
00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:48.890
<v Speaker 4>so it has to be seat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd you know,</v>

1165
00:53:48.930 --> 00:53:51.310
<v Speaker 4>I'd be down to do something,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the problem with running a marathon,</v>

1166
00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:53.070
<v Speaker 4>a marathon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

1167
00:53:53.071 --> 00:53:55.650
<v Speaker 4>without really fucking your body up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you should build towards it.</v>

1168
00:53:55.980 --> 00:53:59.160
<v Speaker 4>You could probably run americans,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you That logic and common sense.</v>

1169
00:53:59.161 --> 00:54:00.870
<v Speaker 4>Why would you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Here's the thing,</v>

1170
00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:01.853
<v Speaker 4>I'm not averse to a challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm not interested in destroying my </v>

1171
00:54:03.991 --> 00:54:07.620
<v Speaker 4>body capital on over many days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're going to do a marathon,</v>

1172
00:54:07.621 --> 00:54:11.980
<v Speaker 4>I feel like you should give yourself </v>
<v Speaker 4>some time and run a five k,</v>

1173
00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:14.220
<v Speaker 4>five k,</v>
<v Speaker 4>five k,</v>

1174
00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:17.630
<v Speaker 4>five k in vegas in january of 2000 </v>
<v Speaker 4>meters.</v>

1175
00:54:18.470 --> 00:54:19.170
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do.</v>

1176
00:54:19.170 --> 00:54:20.610
<v Speaker 4>I didn't run at all.</v>

1177
00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:23.250
<v Speaker 4>It did zero preparation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean none.</v>

1178
00:54:23.490 --> 00:54:25.560
<v Speaker 4>I completed it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was way tougher than I thought it</v>

1179
00:54:25.561 --> 00:54:26.360
<v Speaker 4>was.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my god.</v>

1180
00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:27.193
<v Speaker 4>I just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's about three miles because my </v>

1181
00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:29.393
<v Speaker 4>fucking thanksgiving a couple years ago </v>
<v Speaker 4>in cincinnati and agreed to a 10 k </v>

1182
00:54:35.660 --> 00:54:38.890
<v Speaker 4>training that was unbelievable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pain meds.</v>

1183
00:54:38.891 --> 00:54:39.270
<v Speaker 4>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>god,</v>

1184
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:41.530
<v Speaker 4>how long did it take you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't have no idea.</v>

1185
00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:43.140
<v Speaker 4>I have no idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was.</v>

1186
00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:44.370
<v Speaker 4>I was in real pain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

1187
00:54:44.371 --> 00:54:46.890
<v Speaker 4>so I started running after it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>After they did it,</v>

1188
00:54:46.891 --> 00:54:47.724
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

1189
00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:48.953
<v Speaker 4>this is not good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not good that I can't run three </v>

1190
00:54:50.011 --> 00:54:52.580
<v Speaker 4>miles and not be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much are you running?</v>

1191
00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:55.670
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one hills.</v>

1192
00:54:56.110 --> 00:54:57.600
<v Speaker 4>I'm not running flat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

1193
00:54:57.601 --> 00:54:58.434
<v Speaker 4>that's my argument to is that I think </v>
<v Speaker 4>that what people were worried about is </v>

1194
00:55:00.361 --> 00:55:01.320
<v Speaker 4>two things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>

1195
00:55:01.950 --> 00:55:02.783
<v Speaker 4>this traditional running shoe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have the big fat heel at the bottom </v>

1196
00:55:05.700 --> 00:55:06.810
<v Speaker 4>and you land on your heel.</v>

1197
00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:09.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was all invented by nike.</v>

1198
00:55:09.450 --> 00:55:10.051
<v Speaker 4>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1199
00:55:10.051 --> 00:55:12.150
<v Speaker 4>You're not supposed to run and land on </v>
<v Speaker 4>your heels.</v>

1200
00:55:12.151 --> 00:55:15.690
<v Speaker 4>You're supposed to run and land on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ball of your foot and your foot in the.</v>

1201
00:55:15.740 --> 00:55:16.573
<v Speaker 4>You know the strength of your foot and </v>
<v Speaker 4>your calf and all that shit decelerates </v>

1202
00:55:19.111 --> 00:55:21.540
<v Speaker 4>your stride.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how people are designed to run.</v>

1203
00:55:21.630 --> 00:55:24.840
<v Speaker 4>That's how everybody's supposed to run,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but somewhere along the line,</v>

1204
00:55:24.841 --> 00:55:29.190
<v Speaker 4>nike came up with this fat heal and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>changed the way people run.</v>

1205
00:55:29.310 --> 00:55:33.210
<v Speaker 4>Now they run like he'll heal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You jusT not supposed to do that,</v>

1206
00:55:33.211 --> 00:55:35.250
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Suppose to run your toes,</v>

1207
00:55:35.550 --> 00:55:37.290
<v Speaker 4>feel your feet and the ball of your </v>
<v Speaker 4>feet,</v>

1208
00:55:37.850 --> 00:55:41.820
<v Speaker 4>so things like these,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these things have like zero soul.</v>

1209
00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:42.953
<v Speaker 4>There's just like this thin rubber that </v>
<v Speaker 4>would protect you from stepping on hard </v>

1210
00:55:47.130 --> 00:55:48.390
<v Speaker 4>sticks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Shit.</v>

1211
00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:49.920
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1212
00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:53.370
<v Speaker 4>and by walking and stuff that you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>supposed to walk in,</v>

1213
00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:54.413
<v Speaker 4>your feet gets stronger by running,</v>
<v Speaker 4>continuously run like when you're on </v>

1214
00:55:57.421 --> 00:55:58.254
<v Speaker 4>those hills,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like just keep going to these vibram </v>

1215
00:55:59.911 --> 00:56:00.744
<v Speaker 4>five finger trail shoes and it's like </v>
<v Speaker 4>they're so thin that the other day it </v>

1216
00:56:04.531 --> 00:56:05.364
<v Speaker 4>was so hot out that my feet got hot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I could feel the heat of round </v>

1217
00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:11.550
<v Speaker 4>coming through the salt super thin </v>
<v Speaker 4>runner.</v>

1218
00:56:11.570 --> 00:56:14.510
<v Speaker 4>Neil runs ones the barefoot,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're like griffith park and she was a</v>

1219
00:56:14.550 --> 00:56:15.383
<v Speaker 4>better man than I.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bought a pair of those when I saw you </v>

1220
00:56:17.701 --> 00:56:18.670
<v Speaker 4>had them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bought a pair.</v>

1221
00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:19.893
<v Speaker 4>I thought that would help and then like </v>
<v Speaker 4>the very next week I was on the beach </v>

1222
00:56:22.990 --> 00:56:24.190
<v Speaker 4>and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know how to run barefoot?</v>

1223
00:56:24.190 --> 00:56:24.761
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I woke up,</v>

1224
00:56:24.761 --> 00:56:27.450
<v Speaker 5>my feet were so fucking sore in places I</v>
<v Speaker 5>didn't even know</v>

1225
00:56:27.610 --> 00:56:28.450
<v Speaker 4>muscles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1226
00:56:28.451 --> 00:56:29.284
<v Speaker 4>That's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we don't usually use our feet correctly </v>

1227
00:56:31.241 --> 00:56:32.074
<v Speaker 4>because our feeder in these hard </v>
<v Speaker 4>sneakers and the heart sneakers act as </v>

1228
00:56:35.171 --> 00:56:38.800
<v Speaker 4>like a cast and so your muscles in your </v>
<v Speaker 4>feet atrophy.</v>

1229
00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:41.500
<v Speaker 4>They got a class action lawsuit against </v>
<v Speaker 4>them,</v>

1230
00:56:41.501 --> 00:56:42.630
<v Speaker 4>but for anybody who.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1231
00:56:42.650 --> 00:56:43.483
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>vibram five fingers shoes did because </v>

1232
00:56:45.311 --> 00:56:49.000
<v Speaker 4>they created these thin toe shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a bunch of people got injured.</v>

1233
00:56:49.001 --> 00:56:50.500
<v Speaker 4>They said they will protect you from </v>
<v Speaker 4>injury,</v>

1234
00:56:50.710 --> 00:56:51.543
<v Speaker 4>but not repetitive stress injury.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not like you not being conditioned for </v>

1235
00:56:54.701 --> 00:56:55.534
<v Speaker 4>them injury.</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's a bunch of injuries that you </v>

1236
00:56:56.651 --> 00:56:58.870
<v Speaker 4>absolutely can get.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure people are suing them.</v>

1237
00:56:58.930 --> 00:57:01.960
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what their claims were ruled to</v>

1238
00:57:01.961 --> 00:57:03.590
<v Speaker 4>be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Either they settled or they.</v>

1239
00:57:03.790 --> 00:57:08.140
<v Speaker 4>There was enough ambiguity in what they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were claiming enough like,</v>

1240
00:57:09.220 --> 00:57:10.053
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they were trying to say is that </v>

1241
00:57:10.961 --> 00:57:11.794
<v Speaker 4>they help you somehow or another from </v>
<v Speaker 4>injuries they could overall in the long </v>

1242
00:57:16.451 --> 00:57:17.284
<v Speaker 4>run,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you've got to condition yourself to </v>

1243
00:57:18.191 --> 00:57:19.480
<v Speaker 4>where those fucking things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

1244
00:57:19.510 --> 00:57:20.343
<v Speaker 4>and if you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get like neal brennan blew out his </v>

<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

1295
00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:42.130
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I was going to bootcamp or not,</v>

<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>chin up guy.</v>

1297
00:59:45.350 --> 00:59:50.350
<v Speaker 5>It's a lot of weIght.</v>
<v Speaker 5>To lift up is pretty impressive.</v>

1298
00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:57.110
<v Speaker 5>We buy into the propaganda of bonds,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but we're honest.</v>

1299
00:59:57.170 --> 01:00:00.410
<v Speaker 5>I feel like Donald Trump right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't know if uber rock,</v>

<v Speaker 5>What are you proposing with the no </v>

1302
01:00:08.901 --> 01:00:12.220
<v Speaker 5>alcohol that was you guys that started </v>
<v Speaker 5>that I w I,</v>

1303
01:00:12.310 --> 01:00:14.360
<v Speaker 5>I am personally.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Personally,</v>

1304
01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:15.711
<v Speaker 5>I thought.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't mInd.</v>

1305
01:00:15.711 --> 01:00:16.544
<v Speaker 5>I think it's one of the things I liked </v>
<v Speaker 5>about the challenge that I did was that </v>

1306
01:00:18.681 --> 01:00:22.640
<v Speaker 5>people got into it as well and could do </v>
<v Speaker 5>it with us and they started shaming each</v>

1307
01:00:22.641 --> 01:00:23.474
<v Speaker 5>other and that's the one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the feedback that I've gotten </v>

1308
01:00:24.741 --> 01:00:26.120
<v Speaker 5>from it is when people are like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude,</v>

1309
01:00:26.121 --> 01:00:27.670
<v Speaker 5>me and my buddy started fat shaming each</v>
<v Speaker 5>other.</v>

1310
01:00:27.671 --> 01:00:28.580
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's cool.</v>

1311
01:00:28.610 --> 01:00:31.370
<v Speaker 5>It's a lot of that feel like the booze</v>

1312
01:00:31.590 --> 01:00:32.423
<v Speaker 4>option of taking booze off the table for</v>
<v Speaker 4>90 months or 90 days rather than a </v>

1313
01:00:38.570 --> 01:00:39.403
<v Speaker 4>stroke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was like you on the pch and a </v>

1314
01:00:46.151 --> 01:00:51.151
<v Speaker 4>motorcycle and you see your guy texting </v>
<v Speaker 4>for you doing that for 90 days,</v>

1315
01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:52.910
<v Speaker 4>just too daunting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Ninety days.</v>

1316
01:00:53.370 --> 01:00:54.203
<v Speaker 4>So is it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But is it because you appreciate the </v>

1317
01:00:57.481 --> 01:00:58.314
<v Speaker 4>feeling that being drunk gives you?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it because you enjoy going onstage </v>

1318
01:01:03.250 --> 01:01:04.140
<v Speaker 4>drunk?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1319
01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:05.480
<v Speaker 5>I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't drink on stage.</v>

1320

<v Speaker 5>me for them.</v>

<v Speaker 5>tweets coming in like I saw you hammered</v>

1366
01:03:01.291 --> 01:03:02.124

<v Speaker 5>I would much rather not do a meet and </v>

1367
01:03:03.931 --> 01:03:04.764
<v Speaker 5>greet and just go to a bar at the end of</v>

1496
01:09:01.100 --> 01:09:05.110
<v Speaker 4>curating,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like constriction of the pis.</v>

<v Speaker 5>This is what makes it tricky.</v>

1503
01:09:23.450 --> 01:09:25.590
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm totally,</v>

<v Speaker 5>didn't make a tricky,</v>

1506
01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:35.370
<v Speaker 5>but I'm a dc on the 30th of September,</v>

<v Speaker 5>first,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

01:09:44.650 --> 01:09:47.490
<v Speaker 5>funded on the six hour flight on the.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This is where it gets complicated.</v>

1512
01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:52.440
<v Speaker 5>It failed right there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Where's the second failure coming?</v>

<v Speaker 5>You can get through at that time of </v>

1515
01:09:59.881 --> 01:10:00.714
<v Speaker 5>flight situation that's hanging out in </v>
<v Speaker 5>chicago without drinking good places to </v>

1516
01:10:05.341 --> 01:10:08.550
<v Speaker 5>drink though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's why it's a good challenge.</v>

01:10:08.610 --> 01:10:09.330
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I could.</v>

<v Speaker 5>I could do it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm doing a college the night before and</v>

1519
01:10:12.301 --> 01:10:13.134

1520
01:10:15.121 --> 01:10:16.200
<v Speaker 5>bar afterwards.</v>

<v Speaker 4>comedian.</v>

1524
01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:23.970

<v Speaker 5>I don't like shots.</v>

1552
01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:28.980
<v Speaker 5>And then book.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I go to take a sip of a drink,</v>

1553
01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:31.740
<v Speaker 5>I will drink my legit first drink.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When I do stand up,</v>

1554
01:11:31.741 --> 01:11:33.630
<v Speaker 5>when I tell the machine story on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>second show,</v>

1555
01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:35.910
<v Speaker 5>on the second show,</v>
<v Speaker 5>when I start that I go,</v>

1556

<v Speaker 5>this is cruise control.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to have my cocktail start,</v>

1557
01:11:38.700 --> 01:11:39.533
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to try to catch a buzz in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>middle of the story and I saw I'll </v>

<v Speaker 5>but also to make them never drank during</v>

1559
01:11:49.321 --> 01:11:54.321
<v Speaker 5>a show or just telling the machine </v>
<v Speaker 5>story.</v>

1560
01:12:01.890 --> 01:12:02.723
<v Speaker 5>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but here's the tricky part of this </v>

<v Speaker 5>When we started doing this,</v>

1563
01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:10.733
<v Speaker 5>he went online.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He reached out to both of us and was </v>

1564
01:12:12.091 --> 01:12:12.301
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

1566
01:12:14.670 --> 01:12:15.503
<v Speaker 5>Because there are guys that healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They know there are guys that bought </v>

1567
01:12:18.030 --> 01:12:20.450

<v Speaker 5>the camera about inane bullshit like </v>
<v Speaker 5>your wife would all you're doing and </v>

01:19:41.031 --> 01:19:41.864
<v Speaker 5>and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're watching it but you're seeing it </v>

1729
01:19:44.530 --> 01:19:45.290
<v Speaker 5>in the video.</v>

1730
01:19:45.290 --> 01:19:47.350
<v Speaker 5>I'm watching and I'm nodding going,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

1731
01:19:47.540 --> 01:19:50.480

<v Speaker 5>just to hint of tiddy today,</v>

1732
01:19:50.570 --> 01:19:55.570

<v Speaker 5>pool and a pool and so leanne,</v>

1733
01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:57.673
<v Speaker 5>leanne and I were joking around the bed </v>
<v Speaker 5>talking about this dream I had and then </v>

1734
01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:02.390
<v Speaker 5>she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's do this now because before it gets</v>

1735
01:20:02.391 --> 01:20:04.790
<v Speaker 5>hot and she goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to go put a bra on and I go or</v>

1736
01:20:04.791 --> 01:20:06.770
<v Speaker 5>don't and I'll do the whole thing by </v>
<v Speaker 5>myself.</v>

1737
01:20:07.110 --> 01:20:09.570
<v Speaker 5>Just that little fucking side boob </v>
<v Speaker 5>action.</v>

1738
01:20:09.571 --> 01:20:12.000
<v Speaker 5>You see?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I fucking love that.</v>

1739
01:20:12.030 --> 01:20:13.520
<v Speaker 5>What she do,</v>
<v Speaker 5>she kept bra.</v>

1740
01:20:13.530 --> 01:20:14.680
<v Speaker 5>If I drain the pool.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1741
01:20:14.690 --> 01:20:16.400
<v Speaker 5>Look at you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Then ran three miles,</v>

1742
01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:19.260
<v Speaker 5>three miles,</v>
<v Speaker 5>three miles.</v>

1743
01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:20.633
<v Speaker 5>Treadmills will you actually do run?</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a trench out of the woodwork or </v>

1744
01:20:24.511 --> 01:20:26.850
<v Speaker 5>something like</v>

1745
01:20:29.470 --> 01:20:34.470
<v Speaker 4>they're non motorized.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Treadmill is use those now.</v>

1746
01:20:35.931 --> 01:20:38.940
<v Speaker 4>They use them in like legit strength and</v>
<v Speaker 4>conditioning centers.</v>

1747
01:20:39.230 --> 01:20:40.063
<v Speaker 4>They really take off my.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But this has resistance and it's built </v>

1748
01:20:43.161 --> 01:20:47.420
<v Speaker 4>like a banana,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like so you're running on it so it's all</v>

1749
01:20:47.421 --> 01:20:50.720
<v Speaker 4>entirely on the actual motion of you </v>
<v Speaker 4>pushing your body.</v>

1750
01:20:50.721 --> 01:20:51.554
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's it.</v>

1751
01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:55.370
<v Speaker 4>They're pretty bad ass speeds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Very interesting because the,</v>

1752
01:20:55.460 --> 01:20:57.470
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the faster you run,</v>

1753
01:20:57.471 --> 01:20:59.480
<v Speaker 4>like physically run,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the faster it goes.</v>

1754
01:20:59.481 --> 01:21:03.620
<v Speaker 4>You push it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>push it up to keeping up with it.</v>

1755
01:21:03.650 --> 01:21:06.380
<v Speaker 4>You're actually pushing it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like a teleprompter.</v>

1756
01:21:06.650 --> 01:21:07.250
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1757
01:21:07.250 --> 01:21:07.660
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

1758
01:21:07.660 --> 01:21:09.040
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like when you read a teleprompter,</v>

1759
01:21:09.041 --> 01:21:10.540
<v Speaker 5>it goes at your pace,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so if you read faster,</v>

1760
01:21:10.541 --> 01:21:12.710
<v Speaker 5>it goes faster.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you read slower go slower</v>

1761
01:21:12.880 --> 01:21:13.713
<v Speaker 4>mechanical thing like the,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the physical action of you running and </v>

1762
01:21:17.531 --> 01:21:18.364
<v Speaker 4>pushing it because you're on the slope.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what makes it go fast so that </v>

1763
01:21:22.061 --> 01:21:22.840
<v Speaker 4>you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you don't,</v>

1764
01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:24.910
<v Speaker 4>you don't have to worry about like </v>
<v Speaker 4>keeping up with it.</v>

1765
01:21:25.180 --> 01:21:29.110
<v Speaker 4>It keeps up with you and it's all a much</v>
<v Speaker 4>more natural stride.</v>

1766
01:21:29.350 --> 01:21:30.183
<v Speaker 4>Then keeping up with something that's on</v>
<v Speaker 4>a mechanism that's having the belt feed </v>

1767
01:21:33.671 --> 01:21:34.504
<v Speaker 4>towards you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this is what it looks like when </v>

1768
01:21:34.991 --> 01:21:35.824
<v Speaker 4>you're running on these things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>See how as woodward is one step higher </v>

1769
01:21:39.731 --> 01:21:40.970
<v Speaker 4>to increase your pace.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like you're,</v>

1770
01:21:40.971 --> 01:21:42.190
<v Speaker 4>you're actually pushing it</v>

1771
01:21:42.230 --> 01:21:43.510
<v Speaker 5>step higher to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1772
01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:47.750
<v Speaker 5>I will say I will say in all honesty,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I know that we joke.</v>

1773
01:21:48.110 --> 01:21:48.943
<v Speaker 5>I will say I've been worried about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>idea that running on a treadmill is not </v>

1774
01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:54.080
<v Speaker 5>just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's making my legs move at that rate.</v>

1775
01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:55.133
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is opposed to making my legs take </v>

1776
01:21:56.260 --> 01:21:57.760
<v Speaker 5>me sweating.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's</v>

1777
01:21:57.780 --> 01:21:59.140
<v Speaker 4>good,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it is good,</v>

1778
01:21:59.141 --> 01:22:02.320
<v Speaker 4>but you see how this guy's running.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How is the ball of his feet,</v>

1779
01:22:02.321 --> 01:22:03.154
<v Speaker 4>his landing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's because he's running on a slight </v>

1780
01:22:04.630 --> 01:22:08.800
<v Speaker 4>uphill slant and that's how you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>supposed to land on your feet.</v>

1781
01:22:09.070 --> 01:22:09.903
<v Speaker 4>The body is designed to like almost lean</v>
<v Speaker 4>forward and you catch yourself on the </v>

1782
01:22:13.421 --> 01:22:16.120
<v Speaker 4>ball of your feet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Know how much money I don't know.</v>

1783
01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:20.050
<v Speaker 4>When you're running on an uphill slant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're more likely to do that.</v>

1784
01:22:20.110 --> 01:22:22.420
<v Speaker 4>That's why I like this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Are you serious?</v>

1785
01:22:22.421 --> 01:22:24.490
<v Speaker 4>Yeah sake.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not cheap,</v>

1786
01:22:25.090 --> 01:22:25.923
<v Speaker 4>but it's the name of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the way to running hills is the </v>

1787
01:22:29.231 --> 01:22:31.690
<v Speaker 4>shit and if you live in a place where </v>
<v Speaker 4>you can't run hills,</v>

1788
01:22:31.691 --> 01:22:32.524
<v Speaker 4>I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you do live in a place that has </v>

1789
01:22:34.241 --> 01:22:36.850
<v Speaker 4>hills,</v>
<v Speaker 4>running hills is the shit man.</v>

1790
01:22:36.940 --> 01:22:40.420
<v Speaker 4>It is fucking amazing for workout.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if you run,</v>

1791
01:22:40.570 --> 01:22:42.610
<v Speaker 4>do like put a heart rate monitor on.</v>

1792
01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:47.080
<v Speaker 4>Let yourself get jacked up to a certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>heart rate when you get an and take your</v>

1793
01:22:47.081 --> 01:22:47.914
<v Speaker 4>time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you get down to 140 beats per </v>

1794
01:22:49.451 --> 01:22:50.860
<v Speaker 4>minute,</v>
<v Speaker 4>start running again,</v>

1795
01:22:51.070 --> 01:22:53.190
<v Speaker 4>jack,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that fucker up again in one 90.</v>

1796
01:22:53.410 --> 01:22:55.870
<v Speaker 4>Go as far as you can.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let it get down to 1:40.</v>

1797
01:22:55.871 --> 01:22:57.880
<v Speaker 4>And if you just keep doing that over and</v>
<v Speaker 4>over and over again,</v>

1798
01:22:58.090 --> 01:23:02.080
<v Speaker 4>you develop so you feel better,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your legs move better,</v>

1799
01:23:02.081 --> 01:23:04.840
<v Speaker 4>your feet are stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The difference between like,</v>

1800
01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:08.290
<v Speaker 4>like if you have the opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we live in a place that has canyons</v>

1801
01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:09.153
<v Speaker 4>everywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's fucking trails everywhere and </v>

1802
01:23:11.771 --> 01:23:15.520
<v Speaker 4>they're all stupid shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like runyon is steepest shit.</v>

1803
01:23:15.850 --> 01:23:18.430
<v Speaker 4>If you can get to runyon and run up that</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking thing,</v>

1804
01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:20.650
<v Speaker 4>that's a phenomenal workout,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1805
01:23:20.820 --> 01:23:22.320
<v Speaker 5>Fucking insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I will say this though,</v>

1806
01:23:22.350 --> 01:23:23.790
<v Speaker 5>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I have to say this,</v>

1807
01:23:23.791 --> 01:23:24.624
<v Speaker 5>I have to give a huge shout out to </v>
<v Speaker 5>cameron hanes because when I really </v>

1808
01:23:27.451 --> 01:23:28.284
<v Speaker 5>started doing all this was I think was </v>
<v Speaker 5>when you met him and I and like grid </v>

1809
01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:32.753
<v Speaker 5>trying to get in shape and I hear his </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking mottoes and I'm sure he's </v>

1810
01:23:35.971 --> 01:23:37.550
<v Speaker 5>probably said to himself,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1811
01:23:37.590 --> 01:23:38.423
<v Speaker 5>I should.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Whatever I hear his motto is a no one </v>

1812
01:23:40.201 --> 01:23:44.040
<v Speaker 5>cares work harder.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like I hear that when I run.</v>

1813
01:23:44.041 --> 01:23:45.390
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes it's inspiration.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1814
01:23:45.730 --> 01:23:46.563
<v Speaker 5>but,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I will say that like I sometimes I </v>

1815
01:23:48.451 --> 01:23:52.560
<v Speaker 5>will say to people like myself who are </v>
<v Speaker 5>not as good of shape of cameron hanes.</v>

1816
01:23:53.140 --> 01:23:53.973
<v Speaker 5>Some models could be no one cares but </v>
<v Speaker 5>don't get injured because that is a big </v>

1817
01:23:56.971 --> 01:23:58.740
<v Speaker 5>problem with,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with running.</v>

1818
01:23:58.780 --> 01:24:00.330
<v Speaker 5>It's so tough.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If he get.</v>

1819
01:24:00.420 --> 01:24:03.060
<v Speaker 5>He got him to him.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He doesn't realize he got injured.</v>

1820
01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:05.010
<v Speaker 5>Not just keeps going.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not him,</v>

1821
01:24:05.011 --> 01:24:05.844
<v Speaker 5>but I mean like people who listen to his</v>
<v Speaker 5>inspiration because ricard sometimes </v>

1822
01:24:08.101 --> 01:24:09.030
<v Speaker 5>I've been like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

1823
01:24:09.031 --> 01:24:11.520
<v Speaker 5>I should not really try to kill myself </v>
<v Speaker 5>because I actually</v>

1824
01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:15.950
<v Speaker 4>can't measure yourself against that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He runs a marathon a day.</v>

1825
01:24:16.010 --> 01:24:16.940
<v Speaker 4>Do you think you'd be disappointed?</v>

1826
01:24:17.140 --> 01:24:19.090
<v Speaker 5>Could not do a marathon?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You readily admitted it.</v>

1827
01:24:19.150 --> 01:24:22.870
<v Speaker 5>I think cameron.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think if cameron hanes and I ran for a</v>

1828
01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:24.220
<v Speaker 5>day,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think he definitely say you could do a</v>

1829
01:24:24.221 --> 01:24:25.720
<v Speaker 5>marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why do you know him?</v>

1830
01:24:27.340 --> 01:24:27.790
<v Speaker 5>I think</v>

1831
01:24:27.790 --> 01:24:30.760
<v Speaker 4>he would only be running with you for </v>
<v Speaker 4>the first 30 or 40 meters.</v>

1832
01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:33.670
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he couldn't keep up with them to be this</v>

1833
01:24:33.671 --> 01:24:34.504
<v Speaker 4>preposterous conversation.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you're talking to a man who's far in </v>

1834
01:24:37.841 --> 01:24:42.140
<v Speaker 4>the distance is too great shape.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Guys.</v>

1835
01:24:42.500 --> 01:24:47.500
<v Speaker 4>Guys who are in great shape,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I literally would go to his credit.</v>

1836
01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:54.490
<v Speaker 4>He was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>can we add that to the study?</v>

1837
01:24:55.420 --> 01:25:00.420
<v Speaker 4>We'll have 205 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What was his first one?</v>

1838
01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:05.430
<v Speaker 4>Hundred.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

1839
01:25:05.430 --> 01:25:06.370
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is a different one.</v>

1840
01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:09.250
<v Speaker 4>He's got a bunch of these disgusting </v>
<v Speaker 4>feet photographs online.</v>

1841
01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:12.460
<v Speaker 4>Love it of him losing toenails and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fucking love it.</v>

1842
01:25:12.461 --> 01:25:13.294
<v Speaker 4>So his last last year you ran 205 miles </v>
<v Speaker 4>and this year he's prepping for </v>

1843
01:25:17.381 --> 01:25:18.214
<v Speaker 4>something in october.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's the first time they're doing it </v>

1844
01:25:20.341 --> 01:25:21.174
<v Speaker 4>at 238 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you ever asked him about the </v>

1845
01:25:23.621 --> 01:25:24.454
<v Speaker 4>approach that he went from being,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say a guy in shape running to </v>

1846
01:25:27.611 --> 01:25:29.270
<v Speaker 4>doing the 100 mile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like how do you.</v>

1847
01:25:29.560 --> 01:25:33.430
<v Speaker 4>Did he just start going like I'll start </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing marathons and then tack on?</v>

1848
01:25:33.530 --> 01:25:37.030
<v Speaker 4>Maybe one of the first marathon he did </v>
<v Speaker 4>was very difficult for sure,</v>

1849
01:25:37.031 --> 01:25:39.190
<v Speaker 4>but then he started running a more than </v>
<v Speaker 4>one time.</v>

1850
01:25:39.220 --> 01:25:41.790
<v Speaker 4>He beat lance armstrong and the boston </v>
<v Speaker 4>marathon.</v>

1851
01:25:41.791 --> 01:25:45.970
<v Speaker 4>He beat lance armstrong.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Lance was running the boston marathon.</v>

1852
01:25:47.670 --> 01:25:50.180
<v Speaker 4>I actually started out as a runner.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This was.</v>

1853
01:25:50.820 --> 01:25:52.780
<v Speaker 4>This was for real though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey,</v>

1854
01:25:52.781 --> 01:25:53.614
<v Speaker 4>this is a good Question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was this before or after lance got in </v>

1855
01:25:55.781 --> 01:26:00.781
<v Speaker 4>trouble like I really thought that </v>
<v Speaker 4>that's so stupid,</v>

1856
01:26:01.670 --> 01:26:02.503
<v Speaker 4>so fast,</v>

1857
01:26:04.990 --> 01:26:09.990
<v Speaker 3>but he's one of the avengers are just </v>
<v Speaker 3>really good at biking or am I wrong?</v>

1858
01:26:17.430 --> 01:26:20.820
<v Speaker 3>Someone believes audio statements</v>

1859
01:26:23.810 --> 01:26:24.643
<v Speaker 1>mentioning the bikers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>SUper important and then he started </v>

1860
01:26:30.321 --> 01:26:32.930
<v Speaker 1>doing crazy ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he did a bunch oF 100.</v>

1861
01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Last year he did the big foot 200,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whiCh is actually 205 miles.</v>

1862
01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:40.430
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck was several thousand feet </v>
<v Speaker 1>of elevation to.</v>

1863
01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:42.340
<v Speaker 1>You're going up running through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountains.</v>

1864
01:26:42.380 --> 01:26:47.330
<v Speaker 1>Does he take breaks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lance armstrong and that's not him?</v>

1865
01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>

1866
01:26:47.930 --> 01:26:48.763
<v Speaker 1>That's cameron who was all skinny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Campbell's real skinny at one point in </v>

1867
01:26:50.661 --> 01:26:51.494
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

1868
01:26:52.260 --> 01:26:53.100
<v Speaker 3>Fly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My guess.</v>

1869
01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:53.953
<v Speaker 3>Hold on.</v>

1870
01:26:56.770 --> 01:26:58.970
<v Speaker 1>terry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cam.</v>

1871
01:26:59.910 --> 01:27:00.810
<v Speaker 1>Cam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1872
01:27:00.811 --> 01:27:02.520
<v Speaker 1>that's cam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many moons ago.</v>

1873
01:27:02.700 --> 01:27:06.780
<v Speaker 1>This thing is I wonder like coordination</v>
<v Speaker 1>of lance armstrong,</v>

1874
01:27:06.781 --> 01:27:07.614
<v Speaker 1>1008,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it would have been right in the </v>

1875
01:27:09.310 --> 01:27:11.310
<v Speaker 1>middle of lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

1876
01:27:11.311 --> 01:27:14.340
<v Speaker 1>So that's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got posted to the girls.</v>

1877
01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:18.780
<v Speaker 1>I wonder who's going to write it up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>lance armstrong.</v>

1878
01:27:19.140 --> 01:27:20.190
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder.</v>

1879
01:27:20.191 --> 01:27:22.740
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if maybe it was in his off </v>
<v Speaker 1>season and he was cycling.</v>

1880
01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:26.610
<v Speaker 1>Cycling off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what.</v>

1881
01:27:26.640 --> 01:27:27.473
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what kind of inspiration it was</v>
<v Speaker 1>for cameron to realize your friend with </v>

1882
01:27:31.081 --> 01:27:31.914

1886
01:27:47.191 --> 01:27:48.024
<v Speaker 1>He runs out so people understand that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were talking about running the </v>

1887
01:27:49.591 --> 01:27:51.100
<v Speaker 1>reservoir,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reservoir.</v>

1888
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:51.943
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's like,</v>

1890
01:27:57.841 --> 01:27:58.674
<v Speaker 1>people at home that don't live near </v>
<v Speaker 1>reservoirs don't know that people run </v>

<v Speaker 1>They call it the reservoir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're reading around it like assholes</v>

<v Speaker 3>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's our river Colorado.</v>

1902
01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:40.730
<v Speaker 3>ShuT your</v>

1903
01:28:40.730 --> 01:28:43.250
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's salt water runoff,</v>

1904
01:28:43.330 --> 01:28:45.200
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so nasty.</v>

1905
01:28:45.230 --> 01:28:48.860
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that river full blast.</v>

1906
01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:51.380
<v Speaker 1>It does get full blast sometimes when we</v>
<v Speaker 1>do need that.</v>

1907
01:28:51.470 --> 01:28:52.303
<v Speaker 1>Like last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last year got fucking crazy with the </v>

1908
01:28:55.011 --> 01:28:57.650
<v Speaker 1>amount of water a lot too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was so much water.</v>

1909
01:28:57.651 --> 01:29:00.620
<v Speaker 1>It rained so hard for so many ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They lifted that drought.</v>

1910
01:29:00.621 --> 01:29:02.010
<v Speaker 1>Finally year we pulled us out</v>

1911
01:29:02.010 --> 01:29:02.843
<v Speaker 4>of the drought else.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Was that early this year or early this </v>

1912
01:29:06.450 --> 01:29:07.900
<v Speaker 4>year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but here's the thing,</v>

1913
01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:10.420
<v Speaker 4>you guys know about the salt and sea?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

1914
01:29:10.950 --> 01:29:15.150
<v Speaker 4>the salton sea was a place that they </v>
<v Speaker 4>created by opening up the Colorado river</v>

1915
01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:16.073
<v Speaker 4>and they literally made it a giant </v>
<v Speaker 4>inland sea and it was good for a little </v>

1916
01:29:18.481 --> 01:29:20.700
<v Speaker 4>while.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Excuse me.</v>

1917
01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:22.153
<v Speaker 4>I was good for a little while until the </v>
<v Speaker 4>runoff from all these farms from all </v>

1918
01:29:26.131 --> 01:29:28.350
<v Speaker 4>this like giant,</v>
<v Speaker 4>large scale agriculture,</v>

1919
01:29:28.351 --> 01:29:29.184
<v Speaker 4>all the chemicals and all the pesticides</v>
<v Speaker 4>would get in the runoff and then it got </v>

1920
01:29:32.101 --> 01:29:35.970
<v Speaker 4>into the water and poisoned to </v>
<v Speaker 4>everything and this mass fish die offs.</v>

1921
01:29:36.390 --> 01:29:41.220
<v Speaker 4>To the point where before this they were</v>
<v Speaker 4>calling it the inland riviera,</v>

1922
01:29:41.250 --> 01:29:42.083
<v Speaker 4>like California is inland riviera and </v>
<v Speaker 4>sonny bono used to go there and all </v>

1923
01:29:45.661 --> 01:29:49.980
<v Speaker 4>these people used to party there and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>was like this big resort location.</v>

1924
01:29:50.220 --> 01:29:51.053
<v Speaker 4>Now there are beaches that there's so </v>
<v Speaker 4>many dead fish bones that the white of </v>

1925
01:29:56.791 --> 01:29:59.550
<v Speaker 4>the beach sand is actually fish scale.</v>

1926
01:29:59.550 --> 01:30:00.830
<v Speaker 4>What's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

1927
01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:06.020
<v Speaker 4>millions and millions of fish,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's still fish there and there's</v>

1928
01:30:06.541 --> 01:30:09.330
<v Speaker 4>still people there because it's an </v>
<v Speaker 4>enormous piece of water.</v>

1929
01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:10.673
<v Speaker 4>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Those are all dead fish from this one </v>

1930
01:30:11.551 --> 01:30:12.384
<v Speaker 4>place,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so they have these mass die offs where </v>

1931
01:30:13.771 --> 01:30:17.340
<v Speaker 4>there's no oxygen in the water or </v>
<v Speaker 4>pollutants in the water.</v>

1932
01:30:17.341 --> 01:30:20.280
<v Speaker 4>They have giant dead zones.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These fishes float up the surface,</v>

1933
01:30:20.610 --> 01:30:23.190
<v Speaker 4>but there's still people that fish in </v>
<v Speaker 4>that water and there's still people that</v>

1934
01:30:23.250 --> 01:30:24.083
<v Speaker 4>eat those fish and these communities </v>
<v Speaker 4>around survivor fish do this amazing </v>

1935
01:30:28.621 --> 01:30:31.380
<v Speaker 4>documentary on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wish I could remember what it's called</v>

1936
01:30:32.310 --> 01:30:36.160

<v Speaker 4>but the documentaries,</v>

1937
01:30:36.161 --> 01:30:36.994
<v Speaker 4>the what's fascinating is they </v>
<v Speaker 4>interviewed the people that live in the </v>

1938
01:30:38.851 --> 01:30:39.684
<v Speaker 4>surrounding communities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which are the remnants of what they </v>

1939
01:30:41.761 --> 01:30:44.490
<v Speaker 4>thought was going to be people around </v>
<v Speaker 4>the resorts.</v>

<v Speaker 4>SonnY bono,</v>

1947
01:30:59.281 --> 01:31:00.114
<v Speaker 4>before he died,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he wanted to develop some sort of </v>

1948
01:31:02.971 --> 01:31:03.804
<v Speaker 4>desalinization,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like filtration system for the salt and </v>

1949
01:31:07.441 --> 01:31:08.550
<v Speaker 4>sea to bring it back.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2033
01:35:52.231 --> 01:35:55.290
<v Speaker 4>And brexit were to like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you look at history,</v>

2034
01:35:55.590 --> 01:35:57.390
<v Speaker 4>if you go back and look at like the rain</v>
<v Speaker 4>of trump,</v>

2035
01:35:57.391 --> 01:36:00.480
<v Speaker 4>like when trump became president and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>look at that and brexit,</v>

2036
01:36:00.481 --> 01:36:03.820
<v Speaker 4>like those two things happening,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that opens the door.</v>

2037
01:36:05.670 --> 01:36:06.503
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything almost can happen given the </v>

2038
01:36:08.851 --> 01:36:11.820
<v Speaker 4>right set of circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 4>given people getting cocky,</v>

2039
01:36:12.030 --> 01:36:14.850
<v Speaker 4>someone thinking they're way more </v>
<v Speaker 4>appealing than they actually are.</v>

2040
01:36:15.060 --> 01:36:17.400
<v Speaker 4>Looking at an alternative,</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone's charismatic,</v>

2041
01:36:17.401 --> 01:36:20.370
<v Speaker 4>they jump in and they can be crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's take a chance with them.</v>

2042
01:36:20.371 --> 01:36:21.204
<v Speaker 4>Let's take a chance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's the small town politicians getting </v>

2043
01:36:22.711 --> 01:36:23.544
<v Speaker 4>big.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know the best thing about the </v>

2044
01:36:27.330 --> 01:36:28.163
<v Speaker 4>current chaos politically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think people need to understand that </v>

2045
01:36:32.071 --> 01:36:32.904
<v Speaker 4>this can happen.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think about how like I know some </v>

2046
01:36:35.341 --> 01:36:39.810
<v Speaker 4>of it is just pr stuff like how 20,</v>
<v Speaker 4>20 might shape up,</v>

2047
01:36:40.110 --> 01:36:40.943
<v Speaker 4>at least with.</v>

2048
01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:44.490
<v Speaker 4>It could possibly be celebrities.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We'd like To do this too.</v>

2049
01:36:44.580 --> 01:36:45.413
<v Speaker 4>It could easily look.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Donald trump is obviously he's got a </v>

2050
01:36:49.291 --> 01:36:52.760
<v Speaker 4>long history of being successful at,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2051
01:36:52.890 --> 01:36:56.200
<v Speaker 4>being a television host.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So from a guy who's a.</v>

2052
01:36:56.210 --> 01:36:58.470
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was a great interview on a talk show,</v>

2053
01:36:58.620 --> 01:36:59.453
<v Speaker 4>so long history of knowing how to kind </v>
<v Speaker 4>of work the crowd in a certain way and </v>

2054
01:37:02.321 --> 01:37:06.300
<v Speaker 4>do it only makes sense that someone like</v>
<v Speaker 4>that eventually get in to what I said.</v>

2055
01:37:06.330 --> 01:37:07.350
<v Speaker 4>The way I described it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

2056

<v Speaker 4>you had a popularity contest and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually popular person entered.</v>

2057
01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:13.410
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's the difference.</v>

2058
01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:14.573
<v Speaker 4>like most of these guys are popular for </v>
<v Speaker 4>politicians and here was this guy who's </v>

2059
01:37:18.060 --> 01:37:19.960
<v Speaker 4>popular period.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 4>we were arguing way better at being </v>

2061
01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:25.193
<v Speaker 4>under the gun.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like when those like little hot moments </v>

2062
01:37:27.241 --> 01:37:28.740
<v Speaker 4>with him and you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>He comes up with nicknames for him.</v>

2064
01:37:31.381 --> 01:37:35.550
<v Speaker 4>Like the whole thing was kind of genius,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like chopped them all down and then made</v>

2065
01:37:35.551 --> 01:37:37.290
<v Speaker 4>it through.</v>

2066
01:37:37.291 --> 01:37:38.124
<v Speaker 4>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>probably nobody should be doing that </v>

2067
01:37:40.351 --> 01:37:41.184
<v Speaker 4>job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's probably too big of a job for any </v>

2068
01:37:42.961 --> 01:37:44.570
<v Speaker 4>one human being.</v>

01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:48.330
<v Speaker 4>and this guy's doing it and he's doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>it because he won a popularity contest.</v>

2070
01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:51.020
<v Speaker 4>That's crazy because then you're gonna </v>
<v Speaker 4>have the rock.</v>

2071
01:37:51.270 --> 01:37:54.260

<v Speaker 4>What I'm saying wrong,</v>

2072
01:37:54.300 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 4>you're not talking about the qualified </v>
<v Speaker 4>people by</v>

2073
01:37:56.040 --> 01:37:56.873
<v Speaker 2>any stretch of the imagination.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You talked about the people that people </v>

2074
01:37:58.921 --> 01:38:01.950
<v Speaker 2>liked the most.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's willing to be the rock,</v>

2075

<v Speaker 2>No one thinks that'd be great together.</v>

01:47:54.660 --> 01:47:55.493
<v Speaker 2>Thirty minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was 30 minutes and in my scenario </v>

2268
01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:01.860
<v Speaker 2>I assume there are people are out in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>party for five or six days before things</v>

2269
01:48:01.861 --> 01:48:03.330
<v Speaker 2>start getting really weird.</v>

2270
01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:08.280
<v Speaker 2>Scram cam come to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

2271
01:48:08.281 --> 01:48:11.790

01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:19.920
<v Speaker 2>A little bullshit that you would go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana because all that stuff.</v>

2275
01:48:19.990 --> 01:48:22.130
<v Speaker 2>Normally I'd say that's way healthier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm sayinG here,</v>

2276
01:48:22.220 --> 01:48:25.740
<v Speaker 2>all that's doing is writing you the gap </v>
<v Speaker 2>until you can drink again.</v>

2277

<v Speaker 2>I thought for a moment you feel like you</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel uncomfortable for a day where </v>

2342
01:51:44.231 --> 01:51:45.390
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh my god,</v>

2343
01:51:46.300 --> 01:51:50.530
<v Speaker 2>hold on the last stretch,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stretch,</v>

2344
01:51:51.580 --> 01:51:52.750
<v Speaker 2>stretch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How long ago?</v>

2345
01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:55.180
<v Speaker 2>A car?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2346
01:51:55.340 --> 01:51:56.740
<v Speaker 2>A couple weeks ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2347
01:51:56.760 --> 01:52:00.580
<v Speaker 2>really her house called unassisted </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleeps.</v>

2348
01:52:00.700 --> 01:52:02.560
<v Speaker 2>That's when you go to sleep without </v>
<v Speaker 2>drugs or alcohol?</v>

2349
01:52:02.620 --> 01:52:03.580
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no weed.</v>

2350
01:52:03.581 --> 01:52:04.750
<v Speaker 2>No xanax,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

2351
01:52:05.700 --> 01:52:06.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2352
01:52:06.420 --> 01:52:09.410
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2353
01:52:10.140 --> 01:52:10.740
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

2354
01:52:10.740 --> 01:52:11.680
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2355
01:52:11.710 --> 01:52:14.220
<v Speaker 2>We have a thing called unassisted sleeps</v>
<v Speaker 2>to.</v>

2356
01:52:14.650 --> 01:52:16.600
<v Speaker 2>I think that's a great idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really do.</v>

2357
01:52:16.690 --> 01:52:19.840
<v Speaker 2>I think more people need to learn how to</v>
<v Speaker 2>relax,</v>

2358
01:52:20.110 --> 01:52:21.400
<v Speaker 2>meditate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just go to bed,</v>

2359
01:52:21.550 --> 01:52:25.750
<v Speaker 2>but you can also do your kids off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can get a hold of your own thoughts.</v>

2360
01:52:26.020 --> 01:52:27.580
<v Speaker 2>You can get ahold of your own thoughts </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's a good.</v>

2361
01:52:27.670 --> 01:52:28.503
<v Speaker 2>It's a good practice to do that and if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you just give your own thoughts to </v>

2362
01:52:30.761 --> 01:52:32.950
<v Speaker 2>pills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it'll work.</v>

2363
01:52:33.490 --> 01:52:36.040
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it won't work for everybody and it</v>
<v Speaker 2>works for some people,</v>

2364
01:52:36.340 --> 01:52:39.250
<v Speaker 2>but there's other ways to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You could do it with your own mind.</v>

2365
01:52:39.251 --> 01:52:40.520
<v Speaker 2>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can relax yourself.</v>

2366
01:52:40.521 --> 01:52:43.690
<v Speaker 2>You cannot medItate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can do it without that.</v>

2367
01:52:43.740 --> 01:52:46.190
<v Speaker 2>I mean you can do it with,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's other</v>

2368
01:52:46.190 --> 01:52:47.023
<v Speaker 4>pathways that a lot of people that try </v>
<v Speaker 4>the pills don't try and I wonder how </v>

2369
01:52:50.181 --> 01:52:53.150
<v Speaker 4>many would be successful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean some people know,</v>

2370
01:52:53.151 --> 01:52:53.984
<v Speaker 4>some people have like real issues,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but with some people I think they'd </v>

2371
01:52:55.911 --> 01:52:59.780
<v Speaker 4>probably be just as if not more </v>
<v Speaker 4>successful with meditating,</v>

2372
01:52:59.781 --> 01:53:02.150
<v Speaker 4>relaxing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just trying and figure out a way to like</v>

2373
01:53:02.151 --> 01:53:06.230
<v Speaker 4>consciously dip yourself down into the </v>
<v Speaker 4>place where you go to sleep.</v>

2374
01:53:06.470 --> 01:53:07.490
<v Speaker 4>I'd like tHat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What are you doing?</v>

2375
01:53:07.640 --> 01:53:08.870
<v Speaker 4>You're going to try that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2376
01:53:09.140 --> 01:53:13.400
<v Speaker 4>I did five days and a foreign assistance</v>
<v Speaker 4>sleeps.</v>

2377
01:53:13.430 --> 01:53:15.380
<v Speaker 4>This is what I'm thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking 30 days.</v>

2378
01:53:15.390 --> 01:53:19.970
<v Speaker 4>You 15 days?</v>
<v Speaker 4>October 90 90 minute hot yoga classes.</v>

2379
01:53:20.000 --> 01:53:24.410
<v Speaker 4>That's what I'm thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No booze and then half the days.</v>

2380
01:53:24.650 --> 01:53:26.810
<v Speaker 4>So if you have one day on you have one </v>
<v Speaker 4>day off you.</v>

2381
01:53:26.811 --> 01:53:27.644
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and if you miss them then you have to </v>

2382
01:53:29.001 --> 01:53:29.834
<v Speaker 4>make them up in a row.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But you have to do 15 days of hot yoga </v>

2383
01:53:33.380 --> 01:53:36.050
<v Speaker 4>in a 30 day time period with no booze.</v>

2384
01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:38.120
<v Speaker 4>I can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why do you want to do the hot yoga?</v>

2385
01:53:38.420 --> 01:53:41.120
<v Speaker 4>Because I think that would be super </v>
<v Speaker 4>beneficial for them.</v>

2386
01:53:41.121 --> 01:53:45.680
<v Speaker 4>I think you should do that ina mount and</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's fucking certainly difficult to do.</v>

2387
01:53:46.670 --> 01:53:49.070
<v Speaker 4>Going to fail on that and still detox.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2388
01:53:49.071 --> 01:53:50.690
<v Speaker 4>he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he said 30 days.</v>

2389
01:53:50.870 --> 01:53:54.200
<v Speaker 4>Thirty days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just cut.</v>

2390
01:53:54.470 --> 01:53:55.303
<v Speaker 4>Half the days.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Half of those 30 you have to do a yoga </v>

2391
01:53:58.071 --> 01:53:59.690
<v Speaker 4>class.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hot yoga,</v>

2392
01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:00.950
<v Speaker 4>hot yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 4>90 minutes.</v>

2393
01:54:02.320 --> 01:54:03.153
<v Speaker 4>Once I've been.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went once and I quit like 40 minutes </v>

2394
01:54:06.750 --> 01:54:08.480
<v Speaker 4>into an hour and 15 minute class.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I came back in.</v>

2395
01:54:08.481 --> 01:54:11.870
<v Speaker 4>I took five minute breather.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I took it because it was hot.</v>

2396
01:54:12.140 --> 01:54:14.270
<v Speaker 4>It was like fuck out of it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm out of it.</v>

2397
01:54:14.840 --> 01:54:16.940
<v Speaker 4>But you also like a couldn't run a </v>
<v Speaker 4>marathon.</v>

2398
01:54:16.941 --> 01:54:21.941
<v Speaker 4>I could.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh no,</v>

2399
01:54:24.700 --> 01:54:26.210
<v Speaker 4>we all know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No one would do that.</v>

2400
01:54:26.900 --> 01:54:28.340
<v Speaker 4>So do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So wait.</v>

2401
01:54:28.510 --> 01:54:29.343

<v Speaker 4>yoga classes in a month.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Is that what you're saying?</v>

2404
01:54:34.130 --> 01:54:35.060

2406
01:54:38.770 --> 01:54:39.603
<v Speaker 4>state.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The thing about the yoga classes is </v>

2407
01:54:41.361 --> 01:54:42.194
<v Speaker 4>first of all you could.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's like a real set beginning and a </v>

<v Speaker 4>mental breather.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2443
01:56:24.690 --> 01:56:28.050
<v Speaker 4>This is a super measurable thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

2444
01:56:28.830 --> 01:56:29.663
<v Speaker 4>So it's not like something you could not</v>
<v Speaker 4>train for and then have to do at the </v>

2445
01:56:33.631 --> 01:56:37.320
<v Speaker 4>very end.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is going to go run a marathon.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I kinda like fucking half acid up to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>time you got to run it.</v>

2447
01:56:41.350 --> 01:56:45.220
<v Speaker 4>This is like a sheer discipline issue </v>
<v Speaker 4>because this is what the.</v>

2448
01:56:45.330 --> 01:56:46.163
<v Speaker 4>What's good about this is this going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>cause you to absolutely be in a certain </v>

2449
01:56:49.381 --> 01:56:51.390
<v Speaker 4>place for 15 days,</v>
<v Speaker 4>7:30.</v>

2450
01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:54.030

01:56:54.110 --> 01:56:54.943
<v Speaker 4>say you fuck off for the first 10 days,</v>

<v Speaker 4>in a row.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would it be safe to do hot yoga four or </v>

<v Speaker 4>Looking good.</v>

2465
01:57:37.351 --> 01:57:42.351
<v Speaker 4>Like a good athlete.</v>

<v Speaker 4>He does.</v>

2469
01:57:52.821 --> 01:57:53.910
<v Speaker 4>He does.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He does.</v>

2470
01:57:54.360 --> 01:57:58.560
<v Speaker 4>When he came back from yoga or yoga asia</v>
<v Speaker 4>st.</v>

2471
01:58:00.510 --> 01:58:01.343
<v Speaker 4>Never understand.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I never wanted to do this challenge you </v>

2472
01:58:06.941 --> 01:58:10.230
<v Speaker 4>can listen to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like this idea of 15 days of hot yoga.</v>

2473
01:58:10.620 --> 01:58:11.453
<v Speaker 4>It's hard to do man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>90 minute classes and then and he's </v>

2474
01:58:14.311 --> 01:58:16.170
<v Speaker 4>going to do a marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to do a marathon.</v>

2475
01:58:16.220 --> 01:58:17.940
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this will be a different thing.</v>

2476
01:58:18.020 --> 01:58:20.100
<v Speaker 4>It's a totally new about this as he </v>
<v Speaker 4>thinks he coulD run all the time.</v>

2477
01:58:20.101 --> 01:58:22.230
<v Speaker 4>He runs all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you have to do this,</v>

2478
01:58:22.231 --> 01:58:23.250
<v Speaker 4>this is going to be hard.</v>

2479
01:58:23.370 --> 01:58:25.470
<v Speaker 4>Running is easy for me because it's in </v>
<v Speaker 4>my backyard.</v>

2480
01:58:25.560 --> 01:58:26.940
<v Speaker 4>This is going to be super good for your </v>
<v Speaker 4>body.</v>

2481
01:58:27.260 --> 01:58:28.093
<v Speaker 4>And then here's the other thing too,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like if you get in the middle of this </v>

2482
01:58:30.120 --> 01:58:31.560
<v Speaker 4>and you feel like you can't do it </v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore,</v>

2483
01:58:31.561 --> 01:58:33.840
<v Speaker 4>you could relax.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You could just sit down,</v>

2484
01:58:33.870 --> 01:58:34.703
<v Speaker 4>lie down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and just catching your class and your </v>

2485
01:58:36.211 --> 01:58:37.290
<v Speaker 4>class.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People do it all the time,</v>

2486
01:58:37.560 --> 01:58:39.000
<v Speaker 4>like advanced.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People do it all the time.</v>

2487
01:58:39.001 --> 01:58:40.500
<v Speaker 4>If you feel like you've overwhelmed </v>
<v Speaker 4>yourself,</v>

2488
01:58:40.650 --> 01:58:43.020
<v Speaker 4>maybe try too hard,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know it's fucking hot in there.</v>

2489
01:58:43.060 --> 01:58:47.800
<v Speaker 4>So 140 degrees and you do like these </v>
<v Speaker 4>really difficult bodyweight exercises.</v>

2490
01:58:47.801 --> 01:58:48.634
<v Speaker 4>When you stand on one leg,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he got one leg kick back and you got </v>

2491
01:58:51.041 --> 01:58:53.860
<v Speaker 4>your both arms leaning forward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking difficult to do.</v>

2492
01:58:53.890 --> 01:58:54.641
<v Speaker 4>Sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2493
01:58:54.641 --> 01:58:56.800
<v Speaker 4>and when you're holding yourself and </v>
<v Speaker 4>like weird positions.</v>

2494
01:58:57.020 --> 01:58:57.530
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's good.</v>

2495
01:58:57.530 --> 01:59:01.600
<v Speaker 5>That's a really challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a pretty easy,</v>

2496
01:59:01.750 --> 01:59:04.690
<v Speaker 5>not easy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A pretty not hard pace I should say,</v>

2497
01:59:04.720 --> 01:59:06.010
<v Speaker 5>to do a five hour marathon.</v>

2498
01:59:06.310 --> 01:59:11.310
<v Speaker 4>So it's 11 minutes and 23 seconds per </v>
<v Speaker 4>mile walking at like a four point five.</v>

2499
01:59:12.100 --> 01:59:14.320
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that interesting?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's fIve minutes,</v>

2500
01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:19.180
<v Speaker 4>but 11 minutes and 30 seconds per mile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You get it in six hours or five.</v>

2501
01:59:19.181 --> 01:59:20.970
<v Speaker 4>It's 50 k oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>50 percent.</v>

2502
01:59:21.110 --> 01:59:21.943
<v Speaker 5>Oh that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean I know that we're all making fun </v>

2503
01:59:23.631 --> 01:59:24.460
<v Speaker 5>of this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but oh,</v>

2504
01:59:24.460 --> 01:59:25.293
<v Speaker 5>a five hour marathon is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is literally walking into four or five </v>

2505
01:59:28.011 --> 01:59:29.150
<v Speaker 5>on a treadmill.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2506
01:59:29.151 --> 01:59:32.750
<v Speaker 5>but continuously anyone can do a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 5>it is,</v>

2507
01:59:32.820 --> 01:59:36.230
<v Speaker 5>is it 11 miles an hour?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm walking on a treadmill walking.</v>

2508
01:59:36.250 --> 01:59:37.970
<v Speaker 5>It's not running.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not running,</v>

2509
01:59:38.300 --> 01:59:41.080
<v Speaker 5>but it's not 1130 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pramada casual.</v>

2510
01:59:42.650 --> 01:59:44.150
<v Speaker 5>brisk walk.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But by the way,</v>

2511
01:59:44.180 --> 01:59:45.230
<v Speaker 5>I'll tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw my father,</v>

2512
01:59:46.010 --> 01:59:51.010
<v Speaker 5>he'd walk the marine corp marathon and </v>
<v Speaker 5>he did great for about 20 miles and then</v>

2513
01:59:53.061 --> 01:59:54.440
<v Speaker 5>it bottoms out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did,</v>

2514
01:59:54.441 --> 01:59:55.640
<v Speaker 5>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

2515
01:59:55.700 --> 01:59:58.610
<v Speaker 5>when you did the thousandth episode,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I love these kinds of things.</v>

2516
01:59:58.611 --> 02:00:02.630
<v Speaker 5>I love when I watched the Florida state </v>
<v Speaker 5>game yesterday and got on the trip.</v>

2517
02:00:02.730 --> 02:00:05.530
<v Speaker 5>What you watched boxing matches or </v>
<v Speaker 5>fights when you work out?</v>

2518

<v Speaker 5>like the ending of game of thrones and </v>

2520
02:00:10.191 --> 02:00:11.024
<v Speaker 5>you guys were doing that three hour </v>
<v Speaker 5>podcasts and I literally said I'm going </v>

2521
02:00:12.951 --> 02:00:14.090
<v Speaker 5>to be running a marathon today.</v>

2522
02:00:14.630 --> 02:00:15.860
<v Speaker 5>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did not do it.</v>

2523
02:00:16.460 --> 02:00:18.830
<v Speaker 5>I did not do it When I was seven.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I did 12,</v>

2524
02:00:18.920 --> 02:00:21.170
<v Speaker 5>12,</v>
<v Speaker 5>only half a marathon.</v>

2525
02:00:21.230 --> 02:00:24.560
<v Speaker 5>But I was walking in it because joe was </v>
<v Speaker 5>so fucking funny.</v>

2526
02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:25.633
<v Speaker 5>I would start laughing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like we said he's changing color for it </v>

<v Speaker 5>that's ever lived.</v>

2528
02:00:31.170 --> 02:00:32.003
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I started laughing so hard that I </v>

2529
02:00:33.441 --> 02:00:34.670
<v Speaker 5>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't fucking run this.</v>

2530
02:00:34.671 --> 02:00:35.504
<v Speaker 5>I want to listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I want to be in the moment and just </v>

2531
02:00:36.621 --> 02:00:38.480
<v Speaker 5>giggle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Good excuse to stop running.</v>

2532
02:00:39.220 --> 02:00:40.190
<v Speaker 5>And so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

2533
02:00:40.700 --> 02:00:41.533
<v Speaker 5>and so I ended up doing 12 miles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And in the three hours you ever do do </v>

2534
02:00:45.351 --> 02:00:46.184
<v Speaker 5>the marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I hope there's a hype crew behind your </v>

2535
02:00:47.361 --> 02:00:52.361
<v Speaker 5>goat just quit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Just metro stops.</v>

2536
02:00:55.970 --> 02:00:56.803
<v Speaker 5>Like what would be a challenging time?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You think you could still do it in a </v>

2537
02:00:58.701 --> 02:00:59.534
<v Speaker 5>marathon?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

2538
02:00:59.550 --> 02:01:02.910
<v Speaker 5>I'm asking you a 10 minute miles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tommy tommy,</v>

2539
02:01:03.540 --> 02:01:06.590
<v Speaker 5>planning.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's been plotting something miles,</v>

2540
02:01:06.591 --> 02:01:08.240
<v Speaker 5>which is how long?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ten minute.</v>

2541
02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:12.170
<v Speaker 5>Ten minute mile.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ten minute mile.</v>

2542
02:01:12.510 --> 02:01:13.343
<v Speaker 5>That would be really fucking challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I will say that the one that we just </v>

2543
02:01:16.971 --> 02:01:21.971
<v Speaker 5>pulled up is still very challenging.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What's forced one to 10 minute mile pace</v>

2544
02:01:22.820 --> 02:01:25.020
<v Speaker 5>for $20.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're just.</v>

<v Speaker 5>There's not a chance.</v>

2548
02:01:34.440 --> 02:01:38.720
<v Speaker 5>There's a chance you won't finish the </v>
<v Speaker 5>marathon unless you take about 14 hours.</v>

2549
02:01:38.721 --> 02:01:41.540
<v Speaker 5>I'm not taking long,</v>
<v Speaker 5>long breaks for meals.</v>

2550
02:01:42.010 --> 02:01:42.843
<v Speaker 5>I think you do it in under 14 hours,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but maybe overall there should be like </v>

2551
02:01:47.060 --> 02:01:47.900
<v Speaker 5>third high,</v>
<v Speaker 5>13,</v>

2897
02:18:12.341 --> 02:18:14.410
<v Speaker 7>bombed so hard and think about.</v>

2898
02:18:15.130 --> 02:18:15.963
<v Speaker 7>Think about a straight uP 25 minute bomb</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then on the late show doing it </v>

2899
02:18:18.970 --> 02:18:21.160
<v Speaker 7>exactly the same again.</v>

2902
02:18:25.811 --> 02:18:29.740
<v Speaker 7>make that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that stupid thing like I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 7>I can do that.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>

2906
02:18:33.090 --> 02:18:33.923

<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Because I don't mind that I don't.</v>

3042
02:24:37.301 --> 02:24:39.630
<v Speaker 5>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think I would like to challenge myself</v>

02:24:39.810 --> 02:24:43.050
<v Speaker 5>to the yoga and the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and the not drinking,</v>

3044
02:24:43.051 --> 02:24:46.920
<v Speaker 5>but I do want to incorporate it into us </v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] like I want it to be.</v>

3045
02:24:47.040 --> 02:24:49.700
<v Speaker 5>I liked having people to talk shit to </v>
<v Speaker 5>you on text.</v>

<v Speaker 5>are you drinking the night or whatever.</v>

3048
02:24:53.790 --> 02:24:56.130
<v Speaker 5>But like I'm gonna get a court people on</v>
<v Speaker 5>the outside,</v>

3049
02:24:56.131 --> 02:24:58.110
<v Speaker 5>but I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it should be.</v>

3050
02:24:58.260 --> 02:25:01.140
<v Speaker 5>I like to see the cap on idea.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>

3051
02:25:01.350 --> 02:25:03.080
<v Speaker 5>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't have a problem.</v>

3052
02:25:03.150 --> 02:25:03.983
<v Speaker 5>Try and run a marathon.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But I do think tom said he didn't like </v>

3053
02:25:06.091 --> 02:25:07.680
<v Speaker 5>the idea to me personally because he was</v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3054
02:25:07.920 --> 02:25:10.670
<v Speaker 5>there's just no payoff.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it's like you fall for sure.</v>

3055
02:25:10.680 --> 02:25:11.670

<v Speaker 5>No.</v>

3057
02:25:12.570 --> 02:25:14.720

<v Speaker 5>It's not.</v>

3058
02:25:15.510 --> 02:25:18.500
<v Speaker 5>Maybe it was the weight loss challenge </v>
<v Speaker 5>or the drinking.</v>

02:25:18.501 --> 02:25:19.980
<v Speaker 5>Not drinking challenge.</v>

<v Speaker 5>thrones one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

02:26:45.310 --> 02:26:46.810
<v Speaker 5>But how much do you normally drink </v>
<v Speaker 5>though?</v>

3095
02:26:46.860 --> 02:26:47.750
<v Speaker 5>for just do it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3096
02:26:47.751 --> 02:26:49.250
<v Speaker 5>Let's just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>let's just tell a story.</v>

3097
02:26:49.650 --> 02:26:50.770
<v Speaker 5>Just about to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

3098
02:26:50.910 --> 02:26:51.743
<v Speaker 5>yesterday we had a half a handle of </v>
<v Speaker 5>tito's and we were going over to our </v>

3099
02:26:55.021 --> 02:26:55.854
<v Speaker 5>friend's house and of course,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I said we should get a full bottle </v>

3100
02:26:59.261 --> 02:27:00.094
<v Speaker 5>of tito's thinking that there will be </v>
<v Speaker 5>more people there that would want </v>

3101
02:27:01.991 --> 02:27:02.824
<v Speaker 5>tito's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah.</v>

3102
02:27:02.920 --> 02:27:05.770
<v Speaker 5>And she said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm being dead serious.</v>

3103
02:27:05.800 --> 02:27:08.830
<v Speaker 5>If you go through a half handled tito's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have a legit problem.</v>

3104
02:27:08.860 --> 02:27:09.693
<v Speaker 5>Who said this?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Leanne and I still had an entity that </v>

3105
02:27:11.531 --> 02:27:12.640
<v Speaker 5>was when I came home last night.</v>

3106
02:27:12.940 --> 02:27:15.520
<v Speaker 5>So that's after the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a lot,</v>

3107
02:27:15.550 --> 02:27:18.520
<v Speaker 5>but that's a lot of booze.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And after you cleared anotHer handle,</v>

3108
02:27:18.550 --> 02:27:19.071
<v Speaker 5>like this is.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3109
02:27:19.071 --> 02:27:19.331
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3110
02:27:19.331 --> 02:27:19.740
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>

3111
02:27:19.740 --> 02:27:22.180
<v Speaker 5>What's it just handle it?</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's the big thing.</v>

3112
02:27:22.190 --> 02:27:25.250
<v Speaker 5>It's probably drank at the party.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3113
02:27:25.290 --> 02:27:26.123
<v Speaker 5>it's more than.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That.</v>

3114
02:27:26.630 --> 02:27:29.380
<v Speaker 5>Handles more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>With the actual handle.</v>

3115
02:27:30.650 --> 02:27:31.960
<v Speaker 5>That's why they call the handle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3116
02:27:32.440 --> 02:27:37.150
<v Speaker 5>When's the last time he didn't do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>A few days ago.</v>

3117
02:27:37.530 --> 02:27:39.100
<v Speaker 5>So few days ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What happened?</v>

3118
02:27:39.130 --> 02:27:40.330
<v Speaker 5>Do you drink at all?</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3119
02:27:40.331 --> 02:27:41.164
<v Speaker 5>I didn't drink at all.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fifty nine ounces or just sleep through </v>

3120
02:27:43.121 --> 02:27:45.160
<v Speaker 5>the day?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thirty ounces.</v>

3121
02:27:45.430 --> 02:27:46.263
<v Speaker 5>So essentially you drank.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Did you play music on that once a </v>

3122
02:27:50.370 --> 02:27:52.990
<v Speaker 5>quarter?</v>
<v Speaker 5>A quarter of a handle to one shot.</v>

3123
02:27:53.030 --> 02:27:53.863
<v Speaker 5>Avant is one and a half ounce.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you're basically drinking like 50 </v>

3124
02:27:56.441 --> 02:27:57.274
<v Speaker 5>ounces.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what you're watching me drink </v>

3125
02:27:57.971 --> 02:28:00.850
<v Speaker 5>right now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm barely anything by the way,</v>

3126
02:28:01.320 --> 02:28:02.980
<v Speaker 5>but I.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm still buzzed.</v>

3127
02:28:03.280 --> 02:28:04.113
<v Speaker 5>What do you mean the amount of booze </v>
<v Speaker 5>you're talking about that much if </v>

3128
02:28:08.651 --> 02:28:09.200
<v Speaker 5>that's.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3129
02:28:09.200 --> 02:28:09.600
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

3130
02:28:09.600 --> 02:28:11.410
<v Speaker 5>it's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3131
02:28:11.630 --> 02:28:13.980
<v Speaker 5>don't bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bullshit me that.</v>

3132
02:28:14.110 --> 02:28:15.850
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of tito's a lot.</v>

3133
02:28:15.970 --> 02:28:20.770
<v Speaker 5>If he can drink a half of one of those </v>
<v Speaker 5>cordage I said a quarter.</v>

3134
02:28:20.940 --> 02:28:22.760
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hang on one second.</v>

3135
02:28:22.910 --> 02:28:25.360
<v Speaker 5>I can also drink a good point.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think it's going.</v>

3136
02:28:25.370 --> 02:28:30.370
<v Speaker 5>I noted that it's also scotch much last </v>
<v Speaker 5>10 or 15 shots.</v>

3137
02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:34.940
<v Speaker 5>30th five shots in the handle.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's 35 shots in the hand,</v>

3138
02:28:35.780 --> 02:28:38.780
<v Speaker 5>so half of that 15 shots.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm drinking seven shots.</v>

3139
02:28:39.320 --> 02:28:42.410
<v Speaker 5>Shots,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shots,</v>

3140
02:28:44.210 --> 02:28:46.650
<v Speaker 5>shots with that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Three hours?</v>

3141
02:28:46.930 --> 02:28:51.650
<v Speaker 5>60 shots over 35.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One and a half ounces.</v>

3142
02:28:51.680 --> 02:28:53.240
<v Speaker 5>I'm saying if I drank that much I'd for </v>
<v Speaker 5>sure bar.</v>

3143
02:28:53.660 --> 02:28:54.141
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3146
02:28:55.750 --> 02:28:57.950

<v Speaker 5>away from anyone.</v>

3147
02:28:58.070 --> 02:29:00.020
<v Speaker 5>What about on a flying day?</v>

02:30:05.000 --> 02:30:05.833
<v Speaker 5>You think on the job like a drink.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think the thing is that like if you </v>

3179
02:30:08.631 --> 02:30:10.310
<v Speaker 5>walked through with this and a little </v>
<v Speaker 5>bit,</v>

3180
02:30:10.340 --> 02:30:11.173
<v Speaker 5>they say no way.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's that he has a small bottle with a </v>

3181
02:30:15.801 --> 02:30:19.700
<v Speaker 5>small amount of that volume but also a </v>
<v Speaker 5>tricky problem.</v>

3182
02:30:20.060 --> 02:30:20.893
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So they must have at that point look at </v>

3183
02:30:21.621 --> 02:30:22.341
<v Speaker 5>him and go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

3184
02:30:22.341 --> 02:30:22.851
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sure.</v>

3185
02:30:22.851 --> 02:30:24.050
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You need this medicine,</v>

3186
02:30:24.560 --> 02:30:25.960
<v Speaker 5>those little bottles.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's crazy.</v>

3187
02:30:25.961 --> 02:30:27.450
<v Speaker 5>It's a crazy number.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And so.</v>

3188
02:30:27.470 --> 02:30:28.303
<v Speaker 5>But this,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you put those in your bag but you've </v>

3189
02:30:29.571 --> 02:30:31.190
<v Speaker 5>also made a drink before you left the </v>
<v Speaker 5>house.</v>

3190
02:30:31.220 --> 02:30:31.940
<v Speaker 5>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3191
02:30:31.940 --> 02:30:32.550
<v Speaker 5>we're talking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

3192
02:30:32.550 --> 02:30:33.383
<v Speaker 5>I'm talking to my worst travel day and </v>
<v Speaker 5>this is on the rig on a sunday when I </v>

3193
02:30:37.821 --> 02:30:38.660
<v Speaker 5>fly home.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3194
02:30:38.661 --> 02:30:42.750
<v Speaker 5>I want an average day.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let's just start with way back.</v>

3195
02:30:43.490 --> 02:30:46.550
<v Speaker 5>So you get to the airport.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3196
02:30:46.920 --> 02:30:47.753
<v Speaker 5>A don't eat anything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't eat anything because there's </v>

3197
02:30:50.751 --> 02:30:52.780
<v Speaker 5>nothing in the airport.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just going to give it away.</v>

3198
02:30:54.110 --> 02:30:54.943
<v Speaker 5>But I'm still concerned with my food </v>
<v Speaker 5>intake so I won't have like an egg </v>

3199
02:30:58.281 --> 02:31:01.670
<v Speaker 5>sandwich or that protein.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh,</v>

3200
02:31:01.671 --> 02:31:02.920
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I guess the better than eating it,</v>

3201
02:31:02.921 --> 02:31:03.754
<v Speaker 5>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3202
02:31:03.880 --> 02:31:05.440
<v Speaker 5>So then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so you,</v>

3203
02:31:06.610 --> 02:31:07.443
<v Speaker 5>you get to the airport,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get through security and then what </v>

3204
02:31:10.401 --> 02:31:11.234
<v Speaker 5>do you do a go find a place to scout the</v>
<v Speaker 5>food court for who has started foam </v>

3205

<v Speaker 5>tough time.</v>

3236
02:32:40.270 --> 02:32:45.270
<v Speaker 5>Just flew sober one year ago was a </v>
<v Speaker 5>phoenix.</v>

3237
02:32:45.550 --> 02:32:47.580
<v Speaker 5>Not a big flight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I talked to your wife about it.</v>

3238
02:32:47.660 --> 02:32:49.170
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what I,</v>

3239
02:32:49.200 --> 02:32:50.033
<v Speaker 5>what I've noticed is if I did a row of </v>
<v Speaker 5>unassisted sleeps and then the night </v>

3240
02:32:54.871 --> 02:32:56.370
<v Speaker 5>before the flight took a xanax.</v>

3241
02:32:56.370 --> 02:32:57.810
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>at like five.</v>

3242
02:32:58.260 --> 02:33:01.170
<v Speaker 5>Then when I woke up the xanax was </v>
<v Speaker 5>effectively still in my system and there</v>

3243
02:33:01.171 --> 02:33:03.960
<v Speaker 5>was no panic and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I flew.</v>

3244
02:33:03.961 --> 02:33:07.980
<v Speaker 5>I flew to Minnesota sober and back sober</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I was like,</v>

3245
02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:09.450
<v Speaker 5>ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

3246
02:33:09.470 --> 02:33:11.970
<v Speaker 5>and then I did phoenix and then I did </v>
<v Speaker 5>the hot wings thing,</v>

3247
02:33:12.000 --> 02:33:14.250
<v Speaker 5>hot challenge,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I the next night I was like,</v>

3248
02:33:14.430 --> 02:33:16.220
<v Speaker 5>my stomach's fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was an panic.</v>

3249
02:33:16.670 --> 02:33:20.610
<v Speaker 5>The panic from just how my brain works.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you mean?</v>

3250
02:33:20.611 --> 02:33:23.070
<v Speaker 5>Like what do you thinks is from doing x </v>
<v Speaker 5>10 college?</v>

3251
02:33:23.160 --> 02:33:24.390
<v Speaker 5>what do you center on?</v>
<v Speaker 5>What do you,</v>

3252
02:33:24.391 --> 02:33:25.900
<v Speaker 5>what do you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>is that a phrase I like?</v>

3253
02:33:26.450 --> 02:33:30.450
<v Speaker 5>Is it a fright or just overall panic?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's more like a dread anxiety,</v>

3254
02:33:30.451 --> 02:33:32.360
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Being up in the air.</v>

3255
02:33:32.470 --> 02:33:33.303
<v Speaker 5>dread of the fact that I can't get out </v>
<v Speaker 5>and then it might explode at any second </v>

3256
02:33:35.671 --> 02:33:36.570
<v Speaker 5>and I can't stop that.</v>

3257
02:33:36.600 --> 02:33:38.700
<v Speaker 5>And then I just like right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

3258
02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:40.260
<v Speaker 5>Right now you're gonna blow up right </v>
<v Speaker 5>now.</v>

3259
02:33:40.261 --> 02:33:41.590
<v Speaker 5>I'm going to pull up.</v>
<v Speaker 5>He had that thought.</v>

3260
02:33:42.300 --> 02:33:47.220
<v Speaker 5>If I'm sober man on a flight,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I cry sometimes like the legit cry.</v>

3261
02:33:47.430 --> 02:33:49.520
<v Speaker 5>So I have to wear bring sunglasses on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Dude.</v>

3262
02:33:49.530 --> 02:33:53.040
<v Speaker 5>I am so ritualistic on airplanes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have no fucking idea.</v>

3263
02:33:53.580 --> 02:33:54.930
<v Speaker 5>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I have to drink.</v>

3264
02:33:54.931 --> 02:33:55.764
<v Speaker 5>I have to have a cocktail when I get on </v>
<v Speaker 5>the plane because if I don't have it </v>

3265
02:33:58.260 --> 02:33:59.340
<v Speaker 5>then I started panicking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't,</v>

3266
02:33:59.400 --> 02:34:00.233
<v Speaker 5>I can't take a xanax because sometimes </v>
<v Speaker 5>you get delayed and then you just </v>

3267
02:34:02.131 --> 02:34:02.964
<v Speaker 5>fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How much would you drink on that flight </v>

3268
02:34:04.051 --> 02:34:04.884
<v Speaker 5>to Singapore?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You think the foods that give you free </v>

3269
02:34:07.561 --> 02:34:09.840
<v Speaker 5>boots,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those flights aren't super bad.</v>

3270
02:34:09.841 --> 02:34:11.490
<v Speaker 5>They're not as bad for me.</v>
<v Speaker 5>let me ask you this.</v>

3271
02:34:11.800 --> 02:34:12.633
<v Speaker 5>Talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you ever thought about trying to </v>

3272
02:34:14.281 --> 02:34:17.710
<v Speaker 5>manage the way your mind about things</v>

3273
02:34:18.250 --> 02:34:20.140
<v Speaker 4>instead of like thinking about </v>
<v Speaker 4>medicating it?</v>

3274
02:34:20.150 --> 02:34:20.983
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Just try to put yourself in a position </v>

3275
02:34:23.231 --> 02:34:24.064
<v Speaker 4>where you try to manage your paranoia or</v>
<v Speaker 4>your thoughts and guys are coming in to </v>

3276
02:34:27.640 --> 02:34:32.560
<v Speaker 4>sort of reject them and use some </v>
<v Speaker 4>meditation techniques to relax.</v>

3277
02:34:32.710 --> 02:34:33.640
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what have yOu ever done?</v>

3278
02:34:33.641 --> 02:34:34.630
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like meditation,</v>

3279
02:34:34.631 --> 02:34:35.464
<v Speaker 4>while I haven't done,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I haven't done tom and everyone </v>

3280
02:34:37.251 --> 02:34:41.080
<v Speaker 4>suggested to him transcendental </v>
<v Speaker 4>meditation.</v>

3281
02:34:41.970 --> 02:34:42.791
<v Speaker 4>That's a weird one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

3282
02:34:42.791 --> 02:34:44.680
<v Speaker 4>A lot of people think that's like very </v>
<v Speaker 4>cultish.</v>

3283
02:34:45.060 --> 02:34:47.170
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was a lot of criticism of that,</v>

3284
02:34:47.171 --> 02:34:49.990
<v Speaker 4>but I know a lot of like super </v>
<v Speaker 4>successful people like that.</v>

3285
02:34:50.330 --> 02:34:52.090
<v Speaker 4>It's a lot of weird articles on </v>
<v Speaker 4>meditation.</v>

3286
02:34:52.091 --> 02:34:55.510
<v Speaker 4>People get like a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they get weird about other people trying</v>

3287
02:34:55.511 --> 02:34:56.344
<v Speaker 4>to be enlightened.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's really interesting like people </v>

3288
02:34:57.671 --> 02:35:02.671
<v Speaker 4>start shitting on people like </v>
<v Speaker 4>mindfulness is bullshit bullshit because</v>

3289
02:35:03.401 --> 02:35:06.370
<v Speaker 4>it seems like if you're writing </v>
<v Speaker 4>mindfulness is bullshit.</v>

3290
02:35:06.580 --> 02:35:10.840
<v Speaker 4>Like for you it's probably bullsHit </v>
<v Speaker 4>because you're writing a fucking article</v>

3291
02:35:10.990 --> 02:35:11.823
<v Speaker 4>on people trying to look at things </v>
<v Speaker 4>objectively with clarity and be in the </v>

3292
02:35:15.281 --> 02:35:20.281
<v Speaker 4>moment instead of like be scattered and </v>
<v Speaker 4>cast about by the momentum of their past</v>

3293
02:35:20.531 --> 02:35:23.260
<v Speaker 4>and all the things happening around them</v>
<v Speaker 4>where it takes them out of control.</v>

3294
02:35:23.261 --> 02:35:25.010
<v Speaker 4>The idea is to try to like be in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>moment like,</v>

3295
02:35:25.040 --> 02:35:26.170
<v Speaker 4>sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how could that be bullshit?</v>

3296
02:35:26.490 --> 02:35:28.660
<v Speaker 4>It can't be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it literally can't be bullshit</v>

3297
02:35:28.840 --> 02:35:32.200
<v Speaker 4>because you're trying to like just be </v>
<v Speaker 4>like an easier person to deal with,</v>

3298
02:35:32.380 --> 02:35:33.213
<v Speaker 4>get through life smoother.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How can it makes me like people of </v>

3299
02:35:35.411 --> 02:35:38.050
<v Speaker 4>faith.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would love to have faith stage.</v>

3300
02:35:38.051 --> 02:35:38.884
<v Speaker 4>I loved up faith,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great benefits to religious beliefs as </v>

3301
02:35:41.591 --> 02:35:43.150
<v Speaker 4>long as they're positive religious </v>
<v Speaker 4>beliefs.</v>

3302
02:35:43.151 --> 02:35:46.090
<v Speaker 4>If you could have a perfect religion </v>
<v Speaker 4>like a religion that didn't have all the</v>

3303
02:35:46.091 --> 02:35:50.000
<v Speaker 4>contradictions and hypocrisy and crazy </v>
<v Speaker 4>shit about like killing people that were</v>

3304
02:35:50.001 --> 02:35:50.834
<v Speaker 4>two different types of cloth or hey,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the weird shit that is in any ancient </v>

3305
02:35:55.181 --> 02:35:57.250
<v Speaker 4>text that gets translated into modern </v>
<v Speaker 4>times.</v>

3306
02:35:57.510 --> 02:36:00.640
<v Speaker 4>If you could create something that gave </v>
<v Speaker 4>you like a are like a rock solid,</v>

3307
02:36:00.790 --> 02:36:01.623
<v Speaker 4>sensible ethic that was based on like </v>
<v Speaker 4>science and the reality is what we know </v>

3308
02:36:04.721 --> 02:36:07.690
<v Speaker 4>and how vulnerable we really are and how</v>
<v Speaker 4>big the universe really is.</v>

3309
02:36:07.720 --> 02:36:08.553
<v Speaker 4>If somebody can read,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rewrite something where they weren't </v>

3310
02:36:10.331 --> 02:36:13.180
<v Speaker 4>trying to control people with it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they weren't asking for donations.</v>

3311
02:36:13.360 --> 02:36:14.193
<v Speaker 4>They were Just trying to like set out a </v>
<v Speaker 4>way to look at the world and a clear </v>

3312
02:36:17.291 --> 02:36:18.124
<v Speaker 4>Framework that's open to all </v>
<v Speaker 4>possibilities but allows you to move </v>

3313
02:36:21.341 --> 02:36:22.174
<v Speaker 4>through.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This time and space in the most </v>

3314
02:36:24.101 --> 02:36:27.010
<v Speaker 4>harmonious manner with our fellow </v>
<v Speaker 4>brothers and sisters,</v>

3315

<v Speaker 4>too smart for the old,</v>

3316
02:36:29.621 --> 02:36:30.454
<v Speaker 4>stupid shit about people walking on </v>
<v Speaker 4>water and coming back from the dead </v>

3317
02:36:32.321 --> 02:36:33.154
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I could,</v>

3318
02:36:33.350 --> 02:36:35.630
<v Speaker 4>if maybe it's an allegory,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe it's a parable.</v>

3319
02:36:35.670 --> 02:36:39.490
<v Speaker 4>Maybe it's based on some ancient story </v>
<v Speaker 4>that means something different,</v>

3320
02:36:39.491 --> 02:36:41.320
<v Speaker 4>but we lost it all in the translation.</v>

3321
02:36:41.650 --> 02:36:42.483
<v Speaker 4>We need something else because we're too</v>
<v Speaker 4>open ended and people get super </v>

3322
02:36:46.360 --> 02:36:47.193
<v Speaker 4>concerned with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not meaning anything ultimately at the </v>

3323
02:36:49.661 --> 02:36:52.090
<v Speaker 4>end,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but what it means for sure.</v>

3324
02:36:52.210 --> 02:36:53.043
<v Speaker 4>Something is right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you have good friends and you enjoy </v>

3325
02:36:55.451 --> 02:36:57.100
<v Speaker 4>your life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>then it means something.</v>

3326
02:36:57.101 --> 02:36:58.210
<v Speaker 4>For sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For right now.</v>

3327
02:36:58.240 --> 02:36:59.073
<v Speaker 4>There's no denying that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like in the moment it means something </v>

3328
02:37:01.481 --> 02:37:02.980
<v Speaker 4>and you can be an ils.</v>
<v Speaker 4>YOu could be.</v>

3329
02:37:02.981 --> 02:37:03.814
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you have this fatalistic view of the </v>

3330
02:37:05.141 --> 02:37:08.500
<v Speaker 4>future,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you look at the moment right now,</v>

3331
02:37:08.501 --> 02:37:11.590
<v Speaker 4>it always means something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It always means something to be enjoying</v>

3332
02:37:11.591 --> 02:37:13.360
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's all you have.</v>

3333
02:37:13.390 --> 02:37:15.500
<v Speaker 4>You definitely said some things that </v>
<v Speaker 4>align with buddhism though.</v>

3334
02:37:15.860 --> 02:37:16.090
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3335
02:37:16.090 --> 02:37:18.150
<v Speaker 1>that for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3336
02:37:18.530 --> 02:37:21.110
<v Speaker 1>It's all that was all connected </v>
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>

3337
02:37:21.380 --> 02:37:22.213
<v Speaker 1>People have had all these ideas for </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of years where they realized </v>

3338
02:37:25.430 --> 02:37:27.410
<v Speaker 1>like moments in their life where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>got it right.</v>

3339
02:37:27.690 --> 02:37:30.680
<v Speaker 1>You know those moments in your life </v>
<v Speaker 1>where you have a near death experience,</v>

3340
02:37:30.681 --> 02:37:31.514
<v Speaker 1>you almost get run over by a buffalo or </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that and you just </v>

3341
02:37:32.931 --> 02:37:34.730
<v Speaker 1>standing there looking at each other and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it all makes sense.</v>

3342
02:37:34.760 --> 02:37:35.490
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

3343
02:37:35.490 --> 02:37:38.450
<v Speaker 1>what matters is like love and friendship</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the moment,</v>

3344
02:37:38.451 --> 02:37:39.284
<v Speaker 1>the that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the life that you're experiencing right </v>

3345
02:37:40.341 --> 02:37:40.970
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>

3346
02:37:40.970 --> 02:37:42.400
<v Speaker 1>This is cool right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3347
02:37:42.410 --> 02:37:43.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3348
02:37:43.130 --> 02:37:44.900

<v Speaker 1>five days?</v>

3349
02:37:45.350 --> 02:37:46.183
<v Speaker 1>That was a long time ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's probably the way I remember </v>

3350
02:37:48.261 --> 02:37:52.640
<v Speaker 1>riding a bike for the first time I made </v>
<v Speaker 1>the decision either way.</v>

3351

3559
02:47:23.600 --> 02:47:28.600
<v Speaker 5>but I'd definitely say it would be </v>
<v Speaker 5>doable on your hands trying to keep up,</v>

02:47:52.591 --> 02:47:53.630
<v Speaker 4>earnestness.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like we,</v>

<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3575
02:47:59.220 --> 02:48:00.053
<v Speaker 4>Why don't we give ourselves a week and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we could do this again and sit down and </v>

3576
02:48:06.330 --> 02:48:07.163
<v Speaker 4>see what you think about whether or not </v>
<v Speaker 4>you could wean yourself off slowly or </v>

3577
02:48:11.281 --> 02:48:13.590
<v Speaker 4>whether you even want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>

<v Speaker 4>I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is what I really want you.</v>

3579
02:48:17.341 --> 02:48:18.174
<v Speaker 4>I really want you to think about it </v>
<v Speaker 4>because I think that I think you could </v>

3580
02:48:20.760 --> 02:48:23.790
<v Speaker 4>either decide to not just live your life</v>
<v Speaker 4>the way you live in,</v>

3581
02:48:23.791 --> 02:48:27.300
<v Speaker 4>which is obviously very successful.</v>
<v Speaker 4>People love to see you party with them.</v>

3582
02:48:27.440 --> 02:48:28.273
<v Speaker 4>They love you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3583
02:48:28.380 --> 02:48:30.650
<v Speaker 4>it's a big part of the fund that you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>in,</v>

3584
02:48:30.750 --> 02:48:32.700
<v Speaker 4>you're having,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're enjoying with your standup comedy</v>

3585
02:48:32.701 --> 02:48:35.850
<v Speaker 4>career,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but legitimately like as friends,</v>

3586
02:48:36.150 --> 02:48:38.610
<v Speaker 4>when you see someone who's taken in that</v>
<v Speaker 4>much alcohol,</v>

3587
02:48:38.611 --> 02:48:40.620
<v Speaker 4>you start getting nervous and you start </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting like,</v>

3588
02:48:40.621 --> 02:48:43.470
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how long can you do that?</v>

3589
02:48:43.680 --> 02:48:44.340
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3590
02:48:44.340 --> 02:48:45.780
<v Speaker 4>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's tricky.</v>

3591
02:48:45.781 --> 02:48:48.060
<v Speaker 4>That's super dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not dangerous.</v>

3592
02:48:48.390 --> 02:48:51.990
<v Speaker 4>It really isn't that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's dangerous to have 12 drinks a day.</v>

3593
02:48:52.590 --> 02:48:55.340
<v Speaker 4>Hold on man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is why.</v>

3594
02:48:55.350 --> 02:48:56.580
<v Speaker 4>Oh no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3596
02:48:56.971 --> 02:48:57.331
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

3597
02:48:57.331 --> 02:48:58.690

<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>

3598
02:48:58.880 --> 02:49:00.180
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not taking the fun out of it,</v>

3599
02:49:00.181 --> 02:49:02.580
<v Speaker 4>but I'm saying that if you do that all </v>
<v Speaker 4>the time to do an intervention,</v>

3600
02:49:02.581 --> 02:49:03.414
<v Speaker 4>this was turning into the sad shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just being honest and being honest </v>

3601
02:49:06.241 --> 02:49:08.250
<v Speaker 4>about that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Number one thing that's</v>

3602
02:49:08.310 --> 02:49:12.390
<v Speaker 1>you have to admit is a fair thing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3603
02:49:12.420 --> 02:49:14.970
<v Speaker 1>you do see that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like let's say if you were examining,</v>

3604
02:49:15.570 --> 02:49:17.940
<v Speaker 1>let's say your last week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you realize it,</v>

3605
02:49:18.150 --> 02:49:23.150
<v Speaker 1>that that pace could not continue for </v>
<v Speaker 1>every 100 percent didn't with you.</v>

3606
02:49:24.690 --> 02:49:29.690
<v Speaker 1>No one can keep up with you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I took two naps close to keeping up with</v>

3607
02:49:32.551 --> 02:49:33.840
<v Speaker 1>You.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talk about it all the time,</v>

3608
02:49:33.841 --> 02:49:34.674
<v Speaker 1>lIke how the fuck does he do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>like this is the opposite of what I </v>

3609
02:49:37.531 --> 02:49:38.500
<v Speaker 1>wanted out of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3610
02:49:38.501 --> 02:49:42.210
<v Speaker 1>I think it just turns into like a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People go,</v>

3611
02:49:42.211 --> 02:49:43.840
<v Speaker 1>oh shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's really got a problem,</v>

3612
02:49:44.100 --> 02:49:47.220
<v Speaker 1>but that's what it's turning into this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't listen to me joe.</v>

3613
02:49:47.221 --> 02:49:48.660
<v Speaker 1>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're overreacting.</v>

3614
02:49:48.661 --> 02:49:49.494
<v Speaker 1>What I'm saying is you could live your </v>
<v Speaker 1>life the way you're living at right now </v>

3615
02:49:52.141 --> 02:49:52.974
<v Speaker 1>and you're obviously enjoying yourself </v>
<v Speaker 1>or I don't know if you think you have a </v>

3616
02:49:55.621 --> 02:49:56.454
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you feel like you have a problem and </v>

3617
02:49:57.661 --> 02:49:59.820
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to make any judgment </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever,</v>

3618
02:50:00.030 --> 02:50:00.863
<v Speaker 1>I literally want you to act the way you </v>
<v Speaker 1>feel because you can hunter s thompson </v>

3619
02:50:05.561 --> 02:50:06.394
<v Speaker 1>this thing right into the grave and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of people have done it and they </v>

3620
02:50:08.581 --> 02:50:09.414
<v Speaker 1>probably had a better life than people </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have lived sober and regretful and </v>

3621
02:50:13.121 --> 02:50:13.954
<v Speaker 1>and deepen melancholy states of mind </v>
<v Speaker 1>until you know their fucking body shuts </v>

3622
02:50:19.411 --> 02:50:19.960
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

3623
02:50:19.960 --> 02:50:20.793
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what's better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if a a short life filled </v>

3624
02:50:22.891 --> 02:50:23.724
<v Speaker 1>with partying is better than a long life</v>
<v Speaker 1>of meditating and we're in an orange </v>

3625
02:50:26.521 --> 02:50:28.230
<v Speaker 1>robe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's a real good argument that</v>

3626
02:50:28.231 --> 02:50:31.290
<v Speaker 1>it's not because a real good argument </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the party life is a better life,</v>

3627
02:50:31.650 --> 02:50:35.670
<v Speaker 1>but what I think about any type of </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation like this,</v>

3628
02:50:35.700 --> 02:50:39.060
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to change the way you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

3629
02:50:39.660 --> 02:50:41.550
<v Speaker 1>I want you to Do whatever the fuck you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do.</v>

3630
02:50:41.940 --> 02:50:44.100
<v Speaker 1>That's why I said that already in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

3631
02:50:44.101 --> 02:50:45.420
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't do 90 days.</v>

3632
02:50:47.080 --> 02:50:48.810
<v Speaker 1>It's not the Way my brain operates </v>
<v Speaker 1>because.</v>

3633
02:50:49.760 --> 02:50:52.500
<v Speaker 1>But I'm sorry to interrupt you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is really important.</v>

3634
02:50:52.501 --> 02:50:53.334
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that it's possible that </v>
<v Speaker 1>once you got into it and once you were </v>

3635
02:50:56.101 --> 02:51:00.450
<v Speaker 1>in 20 days deep and you realize like you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can feel better every day and keep going</v>

3636
02:51:00.451 --> 02:51:01.320
<v Speaker 1>at that point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3637
02:51:01.500 --> 02:51:06.080
<v Speaker 1>You could like I think part bert is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get out of the first 10 to fit.</v>

3638
02:51:06.090 --> 02:51:07.900
<v Speaker 1>I'm not a fucking doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what,</v>

3639
02:51:08.080 --> 02:51:10.380
<v Speaker 1>what it's like when people have </v>
<v Speaker 1>withdrawal from alcohol,</v>

3640
02:51:10.381 --> 02:51:12.510
<v Speaker 1>but you are 100 percent right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hardest part,</v>

3641
02:51:12.511 --> 02:51:13.344
<v Speaker 1>10 days or so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was probably sunday morning and the </v>

3642
02:51:14.731 --> 02:51:16.330
<v Speaker 1>dc airport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3643
02:51:16.350 --> 02:51:18.060
<v Speaker 1>That'll be the hardest part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

3644
02:51:18.061 --> 02:51:19.860
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've,</v>

3645
02:51:19.920 --> 02:51:20.753
<v Speaker 1>I've definitely done this like I've </v>
<v Speaker 1>definitely not drank for fucking five </v>

3646
02:51:24.091 --> 02:51:24.924
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's totally doable and I'm not </v>

3647
02:51:26.491 --> 02:51:27.960
<v Speaker 1>going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the other thing that.</v>

3648
02:51:28.280 --> 02:51:29.113
<v Speaker 1>Well we were a little worried about you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have to admit that the concern for </v>

3649
02:51:32.761 --> 02:51:33.940
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's.</v>

3650
02:51:34.140 --> 02:51:36.810
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you're gonna die but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but having the thought like,</v>

3651
02:51:36.930 --> 02:51:37.763
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friend who drinks like 80 drinks a </v>

3652
02:51:38.641 --> 02:51:39.870
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to stop drinking.</v>

3653
02:51:40.710 --> 02:51:42.030
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to have as a friend.</v>

3654
02:51:42.031 --> 02:51:43.290
<v Speaker 1>You go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that a safe?</v>

3655
02:51:43.291 --> 02:51:43.591
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3656
02:51:43.591 --> 02:51:44.400
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

3657
02:51:44.400 --> 02:51:45.750
<v Speaker 1>I honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you got the shAkes.</v>

3658
02:51:45.751 --> 02:51:46.584
<v Speaker 1>I think he'll just drink again because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no way you can do fucking 30 </v>

3659
02:51:48.700 --> 02:51:49.533
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that if he can get past a </v>

3660
02:51:52.891 --> 02:51:56.970
<v Speaker 1>certain number of hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the longer you can get past this,</v>

3661
02:51:57.030 --> 02:51:59.940
<v Speaker 1>there's like six.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3662
02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:01.980
<v Speaker 1>listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is really what it's like.</v>

3663
02:52:02.130 --> 02:52:02.963
<v Speaker 1>It's like gravity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like when you're closer to the </v>

3664
02:52:04.900 --> 02:52:06.120
<v Speaker 1>planet earth is there's</v>

3665
02:52:06.130 --> 02:52:09.310
<v Speaker 2>a lot more gravity and you got to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>further and further and further and once</v>

3666
02:52:09.311 --> 02:52:10.840
<v Speaker 2>you do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can see what you're saying.</v>

3667
02:52:10.841 --> 02:52:15.841
<v Speaker 2>I see what the gravity of alcoholism </v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly wrapped up in it.</v>

3668
02:52:16.550 --> 02:52:17.290
<v Speaker 2>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't,</v>

3669
02:52:17.290 --> 02:52:19.300
<v Speaker 2>I wouldn't say alcoholism because I </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't,</v>

3670
02:52:19.710 --> 02:52:21.780
<v Speaker 2>but the only because when you really </v>
<v Speaker 2>call it,</v>

3671
02:52:22.870 --> 02:52:23.703
<v Speaker 2>call it you to get away from babu and </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out a way to not need alcohol </v>

3672
02:52:29.201 --> 02:52:31.930

<v Speaker 2>I think you can do this.</v>

3673
02:52:32.020 --> 02:52:35.200
<v Speaker 2>I think you can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think it's a good challenge.</v>

3674
02:52:35.201 --> 02:52:36.930

<v Speaker 2>what are the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is that?</v>

3773
02:57:33.291 --> 02:57:35.230
<v Speaker 2>Ninety eight percent?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's a good number.</v>

3774
02:57:35.800 --> 02:57:37.370
<v Speaker 2>That's a pretty reasonable number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>one mile.</v>

3775
02:57:37.371 --> 02:57:38.204
<v Speaker 2>It's so easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ninety eight disasters out of the </v>

3776
02:57:41.001 --> 02:57:45.470
<v Speaker 2>equation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why 98 percent loss of family.</v>

3777
02:57:46.460 --> 02:57:49.240
<v Speaker 2>My dad passed away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to drink.</v>

3778
02:57:49.780 --> 02:57:51.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm just talking about injuries one </v>
<v Speaker 2>mile,</v>

3779
02:57:51.810 --> 02:57:56.810
<v Speaker 2>one mile for most you can twist 20 steps</v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

3780
02:57:59.050 --> 02:58:02.400
<v Speaker 2>That's a strong number number.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

3781
02:58:02.520 --> 02:58:03.990
<v Speaker 4>what what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can do it.</v>

3782
02:58:03.991 --> 02:58:06.540
<v Speaker 4>Ninety eight percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a good number.</v>

3783
02:58:07.190 --> 02:58:10.620
<v Speaker 4>A good number for like running flat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now when you run in hills like ari that,</v>

3784
02:58:10.660 --> 02:58:12.290
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that trail that you and I went down,</v>

3785
02:58:12.291 --> 02:58:15.540
<v Speaker 4>but we did that podcast together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's not a 98 percent.</v>

3786
02:58:15.541 --> 02:58:16.374
<v Speaker 4>I think about that sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like if I broke my ankle or something </v>

3787
02:58:18.391 --> 02:58:21.570
<v Speaker 4>down on how do I get out of that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's an option.</v>

3788
02:58:21.600 --> 02:58:23.260
<v Speaker 4>There's no phone service down though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3789
02:58:23.350 --> 02:58:26.410
<v Speaker 4>I'm going to crawl out of there so I </v>
<v Speaker 4>think about it,</v>

3790
02:58:26.910 --> 02:58:29.490
<v Speaker 4>but I think I can crawl out of there </v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty easy for broken ankle.</v>

3791
02:58:29.550 --> 02:58:31.320
<v Speaker 4>I think you get it to change your </v>
<v Speaker 4>percentage again.</v>

3792
02:58:31.560 --> 02:58:33.030
<v Speaker 4>I think crawl out of there would be </v>
<v Speaker 4>pretty hard,</v>

3793
02:58:33.200 --> 02:58:35.580
<v Speaker 4>but I'm getting now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

3794
02:58:35.640 --> 02:58:37.260
<v Speaker 4>What's your percentage?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're legit percentage.</v>

3795
02:58:37.290 --> 02:58:40.500
<v Speaker 4>You could do it sober for october.</v>
<v Speaker 4>October.</v>

3796
02:58:40.790 --> 02:58:42.930
<v Speaker 4>What percentage?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really think about it.</v>

3797
02:58:43.090 --> 02:58:46.980
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got it.</v>

3798
02:58:47.550 --> 02:58:48.530
<v Speaker 4>What's going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Bert?</v>

3799
02:58:48.710 --> 02:58:53.710
<v Speaker 4>$50 to flip the coin decision away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>

3800
02:58:54.241 --> 02:58:56.190
<v Speaker 4>I think you're wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I think it's way more realistic than</v>

3801
02:58:56.191 --> 02:58:58.320
<v Speaker 4>any of the other two numbers you've </v>
<v Speaker 4>given about.</v>

02:58:58.321 --> 02:59:01.590

<v Speaker 4>full blown hallucinogenic psychedelic </v>

3848
03:01:00.010 --> 03:01:02.230
<v Speaker 5>sorts of weird euphoric feelings.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like,</v>

<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

3851
03:01:05.260 --> 03:01:06.093
<v Speaker 5>A little bit of that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When extends cardio does is gives you </v>

3852
03:01:07.961 --> 03:01:10.350
<v Speaker 5>that after we'd feeling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3853

3854
03:01:12.541 --> 03:01:13.930
<v Speaker 5>the tail end of it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you just feel great.</v>

3855
03:01:13.990 --> 03:01:16.190
<v Speaker 5>You want to just put weed in the bucket </v>

<v Speaker 5>We should definitely not do anything </v>

3858
03:01:21.041 --> 03:01:21.874
<v Speaker 5>rash.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We should realize that he doesn't love </v>

3859
03:01:23.341 --> 03:01:24.174
<v Speaker 5>us as much as he loves going to Vietnam </v>
<v Speaker 5>and hanging out with people he doesn't </v>

3860

3866
03:01:37.330 --> 03:01:42.330
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't go to Thailand to make my own</v>
<v Speaker 5>rice.</v>

3867
03:01:43.200 --> 03:01:44.033

<v Speaker 5>Sleep would weirdos text them the fuck </v>

3868
03:01:47.450 --> 03:01:48.570
<v Speaker 5>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

3869
03:01:48.580 --> 03:01:49.413
<v Speaker 5>no.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the fam who he texts him as </v>

3870
03:01:51.140 --> 03:01:51.973
<v Speaker 5>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Problems should head over man riders on </v>

3871
03:01:55.231 --> 03:01:56.021
<v Speaker 5>the storm.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yes,</v>

3872
03:01:56.021 --> 03:01:57.810
<v Speaker 5>3:33.</v>
<v Speaker 5>This means we're about.</v>

3873
03:01:58.320 --> 03:02:02.010
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're fun.</v>

3874
03:02:02.700 --> 03:02:05.670
<v Speaker 5>We got to keep going.</v>
<v Speaker 5>something sober far.</v>

3875
03:02:06.550 --> 03:02:07.810
<v Speaker 5>I'm just trying to think what this </v>
<v Speaker 5>means.</v>

3876
03:02:08.050 --> 03:02:09.670
<v Speaker 5>This means no,</v>
<v Speaker 5>no,</v>

03:02:09.760 --> 03:02:11.140
<v Speaker 5>we'd.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3878
03:02:11.170 --> 03:02:12.880
<v Speaker 5>On one hand I don't want to do the </v>
<v Speaker 5>knotweed.</v>

3879
03:02:13.150 --> 03:02:16.240
<v Speaker 5>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think if he does sober but also smokes</v>

3880
03:02:16.241 --> 03:02:17.074
<v Speaker 5>weed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's just gonna be a stop gap to get </v>

3881
03:02:17.801 --> 03:02:19.420
<v Speaker 5>them right back to drinking heavily </v>
<v Speaker 5>again.</v>

3882
03:02:20.230 --> 03:02:23.770
<v Speaker 5>It's interesting you say it again,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that if you're allowed to smoke weed,</v>

3883
03:02:24.080 --> 03:02:28.010
<v Speaker 5>you're smoking into drinking more.</v>
<v Speaker 5>As soon as I'm like,</v>

3884
03:02:28.240 --> 03:02:29.140
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no way around,</v>

3885
03:02:29.141 --> 03:02:30.250

<v Speaker 1>talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When yoU got to also say,</v>

4082
03:11:19.240 --> 03:11:20.073
<v Speaker 1>how do we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much water I have to bring in there </v>

4083
03:11:20.711 --> 03:11:21.544
<v Speaker 1>to do that saFely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll talk to you a gallon of water </v>

4084
03:11:25.950 --> 03:11:27.080
<v Speaker 1>before you don't want to do.</v>

4085
03:11:27.100 --> 03:11:29.080
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have like one of those flasks,</v>

4086
03:11:29.150 --> 03:11:31.780
<v Speaker 1>I think they're Called hydro flasks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's giant.</v>

4087
03:11:32.490 --> 03:11:34.900
<v Speaker 1>It's sitting there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really fat and wide.</v>

4088
03:11:34.930 --> 03:11:35.763
<v Speaker 1>Look at elephant deck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fill it up with ice to top of small ice </v>

4089
03:11:38.981 --> 03:11:41.880
<v Speaker 1>cubes and then I fill it up with water </v>
<v Speaker 1>so that you know,</v>

4090
03:11:41.950 --> 03:11:42.783
<v Speaker 1>the ice has a lot of room for water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets so there and then when I'm in </v>

4091
03:11:44.501 --> 03:11:49.501
<v Speaker 1>class for that 90 minutes I'm drinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>like cold water every,</v>

4092
03:11:49.570 --> 03:11:51.340
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five or six poses or something.</v>

4093
03:11:51.341 --> 03:11:52.174
<v Speaker 1>I tell you to take a break and have </v>
<v Speaker 1>something by the end you have no water </v>

4094
03:11:53.681 --> 03:11:55.210
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty close.</v>

4095
03:11:55.240 --> 03:11:56.780
<v Speaker 1>Usually I've just sort of like a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit of ice.</v>

4096
03:11:56.781 --> 03:11:59.980
<v Speaker 1>So I've drank a whole 64 ounce thing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>a 90 minute class.</v>

4097
03:11:59.981 --> 03:12:00.814
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to do man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think that's one of this done in </v>

4098
03:12:04.241 --> 03:12:05.410
<v Speaker 1>90 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what I think.</v>

4099
03:12:05.411 --> 03:12:06.244
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a real difficult to 60 mine</v>
<v Speaker 1>with yoga says the standard was 60 </v>

4100
03:12:09.470 --> 03:12:12.910
<v Speaker 1>minutes pussy when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you can get through it.</v>

4101
03:12:13.150 --> 03:12:16.030
<v Speaker 1>If you can get through 15 of those in 30</v>
<v Speaker 1>days,</v>

4102
03:12:16.031 --> 03:12:17.950
<v Speaker 1>I think you even fucking get through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of shit,</v>

4103
03:12:17.951 --> 03:12:18.784
<v Speaker 1>but I think you surprise yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you're totally right and the </v>

4104
03:12:20.620 --> 03:12:22.750
<v Speaker 1>amount of discipline it will you'll need</v>
<v Speaker 1>on two fronts.</v>

4105
03:12:22.751 --> 03:12:23.770
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's the other thing.</v>

<v Speaker 2>wagon kill bill.</v>

4316
03:23:15.050 --> 03:23:17.810
<v Speaker 2>Should we hold hands while we do this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if we do that,</v>

4317
03:23:17.840 --> 03:23:19.730
<v Speaker 2>if we do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if someone doesn't do it,</v>

4318
03:23:19.731 --> 03:23:23.330
<v Speaker 2>then what happens twice in four hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If someone doesn't do it.</v>

4319
03:23:23.860 --> 03:23:26.000
<v Speaker 2>I had to fly home to meet my family for </v>
<v Speaker 2>three days,</v>

4320
03:23:26.001 --> 03:23:28.940
<v Speaker 2>then come back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn'T go to london and come here,</v>

4321

<v Speaker 2>face it here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is it takes a ton of money right </v>

4322
03:23:33.420 --> 03:23:35.240
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about sobriety related?</v>

4323
03:23:35.330 --> 03:23:36.163
<v Speaker 2>How about the loser has to throw a party</v>
<v Speaker 2>for the other people in their honor and </v>

4324
03:23:41.870 --> 03:23:44.120
<v Speaker 2>you have to do like ice sculptures and </v>
<v Speaker 2>make it crazy.</v>

4325
03:23:45.670 --> 03:23:47.630
<v Speaker 2>Crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I fucking hate you.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Why don't we do this all day?</v>

4327
03:23:53.200 --> 03:23:58.200
<v Speaker 2>And they're shooting sculptures like </v>
<v Speaker 2>half limp dicks are dripping down.</v>

4328
03:24:01.371 --> 03:24:05.450
<v Speaker 2>IT takes longer for them to like break </v>
<v Speaker 2>off and they all go into birth.</v>

4329
03:24:05.480 --> 03:24:06.313
<v Speaker 2>Mouth it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because if the artist is good enough to </v>

4330
03:24:14.271 --> 03:24:17.530
<v Speaker 2>show how much you love,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sticks to your face.</v>

4331
03:24:17.600 --> 03:24:22.600

<v Speaker 2>no what?</v>

4333
03:24:26.100 --> 03:24:28.880
<v Speaker 2>So if we all do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the capital on,</v>

4334
03:24:28.930 --> 03:24:30.100
<v Speaker 2>then the loser of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4335
03:24:30.190 --> 03:24:31.790
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it carries over.</v>

4336
03:24:31.880 --> 03:24:32.713
<v Speaker 2>That's what we're before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which he said before it was instead of </v>

4337
03:24:36.210 --> 03:24:37.220

03:24:39.440 --> 03:24:43.710
<v Speaker 2>that he couldn't do 90 days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if he did do 90 days,</v>

4340
03:24:43.770 --> 03:24:44.160
<v Speaker 2>then</v>

4341
03:24:44.160 --> 03:24:46.710
<v Speaker 1>you could get the honor of challenge and</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes to a marathon,</v>

4342
03:24:46.711 --> 03:24:47.544

<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4343

4344
03:24:47.901 --> 03:24:48.540
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

4345
03:24:48.540 --> 03:24:49.373
<v Speaker 1>The winter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the winter calphalon for who's the best </v>

4346
03:24:53.681 --> 03:24:54.514
<v Speaker 1>thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shape.</v>

4347
03:24:54.600 --> 03:24:55.630
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's good.</v>

4348
03:24:55.870 --> 03:24:56.703
<v Speaker 1>And the loser,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the decathlon pays the winner of the </v>

4349
03:24:58.381 --> 03:25:00.900
<v Speaker 1>decathlon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The party.</v>

4350
03:25:01.410 --> 03:25:03.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4351
03:25:03.660 --> 03:25:05.070
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's what we're doing.</v>

4352
03:25:05.260 --> 03:25:06.730
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty days sober.</v>

4353
03:25:06.770 --> 03:25:09.210
<v Speaker 1>October 15,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15,</v>

4354
03:25:09.360 --> 03:25:12.420
<v Speaker 1>31 days sober.</v>
<v Speaker 1>October already in october.</v>

4355
03:25:13.200 --> 03:25:14.480
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can the,</v>

4356
03:25:14.600 --> 03:25:18.900
<v Speaker 1>can the loser also have to shower the </v>
<v Speaker 1>winter in good words.</v>

4357
03:25:19.260 --> 03:25:20.640
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and praise.</v>

4358
03:25:20.700 --> 03:25:23.130
<v Speaker 1>I would love for a period of at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>four minutes.</v>

4359
03:25:23.610 --> 03:25:25.260
<v Speaker 1>Interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we should do it the opposite.</v>

4360
03:25:25.440 --> 03:25:30.440
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the winters shower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the losers to rebuild their self esteem.</v>

4361
03:25:31.540 --> 03:25:34.740
<v Speaker 1>HorrifiC defeat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think of things show that burned up.</v>

4362
03:25:34.810 --> 03:25:35.643
<v Speaker 1>That's really what we're able to look at</v>
<v Speaker 1>that point because for sure die off </v>

4363
03:25:42.091 --> 03:25:45.570
<v Speaker 1>round 13 yoga classes in six or seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>days and no booze.</v>

4364
03:25:45.600 --> 03:25:47.520
<v Speaker 1>So once you fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we all just stop,</v>

4365
03:25:47.760 --> 03:25:51.270
<v Speaker 1>stop talking to me directly if it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition we're all doing.</v>

4366
03:25:51.780 --> 03:25:56.780
<v Speaker 1>WHo do you think of this table would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the hardest time quitting booze for</v>

4367

4381
03:26:34.290 --> 03:26:35.123
<v Speaker 1>I enjoy yoga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably the hardest time because I </v>

4382
03:26:36.601 --> 03:26:38.790
<v Speaker 1>get claustrophobic and never do it that </v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

4383
03:26:38.791 --> 03:26:40.380
<v Speaker 1>I Never do it.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I think I did three times a week once.</v>

4386
03:26:47.100 --> 03:26:49.320
<v Speaker 1>I've done twice a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple times.</v>

4387
03:26:49.500 --> 03:26:51.690
<v Speaker 1>Most of tHe time I do one time a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

4388
03:26:51.691 --> 03:26:52.524
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you a question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I pass out and what people have to </v>

4389
03:26:54.280 --> 03:26:55.113
<v Speaker 1>dragged out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dragged out in your mouth and then you </v>

4390
03:27:02.580 --> 03:27:06.390
<v Speaker 1>don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You lose against your will.</v>

4391
03:27:06.391 --> 03:27:10.230
<v Speaker 1>They take you out of there and getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to take you out backwards.</v>

4392
03:27:10.480 --> 03:27:11.760
<v Speaker 1>People against your will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cops.</v>

4393
03:27:11.761 --> 03:27:15.200
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell them the black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen.</v>

4394
03:27:15.270 --> 03:27:17.360
<v Speaker 1>All you should do is when you get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>like you got.</v>

4395
03:27:17.440 --> 03:27:21.180
<v Speaker 1>It's really on scout's honor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you get to an unmanageable state of</v>

4396
03:27:21.181 --> 03:27:24.330
<v Speaker 1>heat and exhaustion just laid down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's called savasana.</v>

4397
03:27:24.331 --> 03:27:25.164
<v Speaker 1>You laid down flat and just chill out </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then when you feel like you've </v>

4398
03:27:27.301 --> 03:27:30.090
<v Speaker 1>recovered a little bit and then you get </v>
<v Speaker 1>back up and ritually yoga,</v>

4399
03:27:31.140 --> 03:27:31.973
<v Speaker 1>hot yoga is going to be 60 minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ninety minutes is better because it </v>

4400
03:27:36.350 --> 03:27:40.290
<v Speaker 1>shows between 60 and 90.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what separates the girls from the</v>

4401
03:27:40.291 --> 03:27:41.530
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying,</v>

4402
03:27:41.610 --> 03:27:42.443
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

4403
03:27:42.490 --> 03:27:44.680
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be the woman girl here.</v>

4404
03:27:44.770 --> 03:27:49.720
<v Speaker 2>I'm just yoga break.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's tom's a power lifter.</v>

4405
03:27:49.721 --> 03:27:53.260
<v Speaker 2>he's not even like cardio guy three </v>
<v Speaker 2>times in a five minute break,</v>

4406
03:27:53.261 --> 03:27:55.590
<v Speaker 2>three of the 15 weeks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no breaks,</v>

4407
03:27:57.460 --> 03:27:59.680
<v Speaker 2>break,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge challenge,</v>

4408
03:27:59.710 --> 03:28:00.543
<v Speaker 2>no breaks pussies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let let it be a little challenging to </v>

4409
03:28:02.801 --> 03:28:04.750
<v Speaker 2>you guys as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Health wise.</v>

4410
03:28:04.810 --> 03:28:07.090
<v Speaker 2>Let's get super challenging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4411
03:28:07.150 --> 03:28:09.400
<v Speaker 2>I will quit drinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>End to the yoga.</v>

4412
03:28:09.730 --> 03:28:13.990
<v Speaker 2>All you guys have to do is not drink,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a challenge.</v>

4413
03:28:15.010 --> 03:28:16.660
<v Speaker 2>And then do the yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is a huge.</v>

4414
03:28:16.661 --> 03:28:18.850
<v Speaker 2>I think what we might all fail on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then what happens?</v>

4415
03:28:19.330 --> 03:28:23.740
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even one time convinced that I could</v>

4416
03:28:23.741 --> 03:28:26.440
<v Speaker 2>do it and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the one who does it all the time.</v>

4417
03:28:26.441 --> 03:28:28.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm saying we should be able to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So three,</v>

4418
03:28:28.511 --> 03:28:33.511
<v Speaker 2>five minute breaks three times over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>break room arguing as much as this.</v>

4419
03:28:35.470 --> 03:28:36.490
<v Speaker 2>And I didn't like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

4420
03:28:36.491 --> 03:28:38.830
<v Speaker 2>good point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The harder challenges me not drinking,</v>

4421
03:28:38.860 --> 03:28:39.693
<v Speaker 2>no breaks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch,</v>

4422
03:28:39.700 --> 03:28:40.800
<v Speaker 2>no fluff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure fail.</v>

4423
03:28:40.810 --> 03:28:45.810
<v Speaker 2>And then I'm thinking to myself and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person who wins that challenge picks</v>

4424
03:28:47.210 --> 03:28:49.510
<v Speaker 2>that up and gets the name that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>capital event.</v>

4425
03:28:49.540 --> 03:28:50.373
<v Speaker 2>We do some sort of a physIcal event.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of shit be like a one day of </v>

4426
03:28:55.451 --> 03:28:58.660
<v Speaker 2>bike race,</v>
<v Speaker 2>school track meet basically.</v>

4427
03:28:58.661 --> 03:28:59.494
<v Speaker 2>So the benefit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well we set up the benefit of choosing </v>

4428
03:29:02.740 --> 03:29:05.800
<v Speaker 2>an olympiad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You let's say you know you,</v>

4429
03:29:06.010 --> 03:29:08.230
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I'm the best sprinter or whatever,</v>

4430
03:29:08.290 --> 03:29:12.430
<v Speaker 2>so we have to do this sprint.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the best at whatever pull up.</v>

4431
03:29:12.431 --> 03:29:13.264
<v Speaker 2>So you'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do we have to do like you named the </v>

4432
03:29:14.340 --> 03:29:19.340
<v Speaker 2>events if you win against all the the </v>
<v Speaker 2>winter and all the events,</v>

4433
03:29:19.541 --> 03:29:20.620
<v Speaker 2>you would just name it all on your </v>
<v Speaker 2>favorite.</v>

4434
03:29:21.420 --> 03:29:22.253
<v Speaker 2>ObvIously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold on,</v>

4435
03:29:22.360 --> 03:29:25.420
<v Speaker 2>but that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that makes sense for suck dicks.</v>

4436
03:29:27.270 --> 03:29:30.460
<v Speaker 2>Dominate fucking nacho far.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4437
03:29:30.461 --> 03:29:30.791
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4438
03:29:30.791 --> 03:29:31.720
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not physical.</v>

4439
03:29:32.040 --> 03:29:32.873
<v Speaker 2>It's a physical events.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd all have to have some say you have </v>

4440
03:29:35.120 --> 03:29:37.740
<v Speaker 2>more say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>AlrigHt,</v>

4441
03:29:37.840 --> 03:29:40.630
<v Speaker 2>what would you choose if you had the </v>
<v Speaker 2>opportunity to create a gauntlet?</v>

4442
03:29:40.890 --> 03:29:42.910
<v Speaker 2>A gauntlet of different difficult </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercises.</v>

4443
03:29:42.950 --> 03:29:47.950
<v Speaker 2>Got it for 40 a 100 yard dash.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about four?</v>

4444
03:29:50.760 --> 03:29:54.550
<v Speaker 2>So sprinting a 4:40</v>
<v Speaker 2>is one a quarter mile,</v>

4445
03:29:54.850 --> 03:29:56.830
<v Speaker 2>quarter mile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then a hundred yard dash.</v>

4446
03:29:56.831 --> 03:29:57.664
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This to to run a break in here and say </v>

4447

4449
03:30:01.931 --> 03:30:02.830

<v Speaker 2>but that's what I think.</v>

4450
03:30:02.960 --> 03:30:05.880
<v Speaker 2>That's where I think I'd accept.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where I think excel.</v>

4451
03:30:05.890 --> 03:30:06.820

<v Speaker 1>tell them why men love to do it.</v>

4524
03:33:55.001 --> 03:33:58.380
<v Speaker 1>I'd love to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do man listen to that on your.</v>

4525
03:33:58.381 --> 03:34:02.070
<v Speaker 1>On the hike or playing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I loved it and I was like,</v>

4526
03:34:02.280 --> 03:34:03.990
<v Speaker 1>I know you guys smoked a joint before </v>
<v Speaker 1>the uphill.</v>

4527
03:34:04.050 --> 03:34:04.883
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Open for that paleo and get down to the </v>

4528
03:34:06.230 --> 03:34:08.130
<v Speaker 1>basin and I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would never.</v>

4529
03:34:08.131 --> 03:34:08.964
<v Speaker 1>I would never be able to do that because</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would totally be huffing and puffing </v>

4530
03:34:11.131 --> 03:34:12.150
<v Speaker 1>up it up hill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

4531
03:34:12.151 --> 03:34:15.120
<v Speaker 1>honestly mad at it actually dilates your</v>
<v Speaker 1>lungs.</v>

4532
03:34:15.121 --> 03:34:17.550
<v Speaker 1>I do cardio after I smoke weed all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

4533
03:34:17.730 --> 03:34:18.563
<v Speaker 1>I can't do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go longer because you doing literally </v>

4534
03:34:20.731 --> 03:34:21.420
<v Speaker 1>can go longer.</v>

4535
03:34:21.420 --> 03:34:22.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

4536
03:34:22.190 --> 03:34:23.023
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think jamie knows jimmy marathon </v>

4537
03:34:25.651 --> 03:34:26.484
<v Speaker 1>runners that blase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they'll smoke a little bit before </v>

4538
03:34:28.441 --> 03:34:29.370
<v Speaker 1>they run their.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

4539
03:34:29.460 --> 03:34:30.293
<v Speaker 1>My thought on all of this is it would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice if we all did something just like </v>

4540
03:34:33.601 --> 03:34:35.970
<v Speaker 1>your weight loss challenge did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think the weight loss challenge,</v>

4541
03:34:35.971 --> 03:34:36.804
<v Speaker 1>we might've missed the mark quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly with the idea that you guys </v>

4542
03:34:39.061 --> 03:34:42.200
<v Speaker 1>could be hydrate yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mr mark [inaudible].</v>

4543
03:34:42.210 --> 03:34:43.680
<v Speaker 1>I said that's what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's where three straight days,</v>

4544
03:34:43.740 --> 03:34:44.580
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I'm saying,</v>

4545
03:34:45.750 --> 03:34:47.520
<v Speaker 1>because they wouldn't listen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you wrong?</v>

4546
03:34:47.521 --> 03:34:48.354
<v Speaker 1>Because that's super bad for your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's like insanely bad for your body </v>

4547
03:34:51.001 --> 03:34:53.910
<v Speaker 1>to be that dehydrated three days in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>row and drinking's not bad.</v>

4548
03:34:54.390 --> 03:34:57.050
<v Speaker 1>It's not nearly as bad as dehydrating </v>
<v Speaker 1>yourself like that.</v>

4549
03:34:57.190 --> 03:34:58.023
<v Speaker 1>Drinking is normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body is normally processing </v>

4550
03:35:00.301 --> 03:35:02.190
<v Speaker 1>alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you drink on a normal basis,</v>

4551
03:35:02.430 --> 03:35:03.263
<v Speaker 1>your liver processes that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when you dehydrate yourself like 15 </v>

4552
03:35:05.821 --> 03:35:10.821
<v Speaker 1>pounds of water or like a yoga class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're body's not firing 64 ounces while</v>

4553
03:35:11.221 --> 03:35:12.054
<v Speaker 1>you're in class.</v>

4554
03:35:12.380 --> 03:35:15.990
<v Speaker 1>You're gonna get a fucking great gallon </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of the class.</v>

4555
03:35:16.440 --> 03:35:17.330
<v Speaker 1>I do think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

4556
03:35:18.270 --> 03:35:19.590
<v Speaker 1>hold on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>

4557
03:35:19.950 --> 03:35:23.280
<v Speaker 1>Before you go and come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop.</v>

4558
03:35:23.281 --> 03:35:24.114
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every of us I think twice in this </v>

4559
03:35:26.521 --> 03:35:26.990
<v Speaker 1>podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>

<v Speaker 1>out in our makeup.</v>

4562
03:35:31.910 --> 03:35:33.340
<v Speaker 1>This is all mental.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

4563
03:35:33.370 --> 03:35:35.700
<v Speaker 1>Why would you not be able to do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I can do it,</v>

4564
03:35:35.701 --> 03:35:37.860
<v Speaker 1>of course you can do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Different sizes.</v>

4565
03:35:39.710 --> 03:35:41.370
<v Speaker 1>That's one reason you can do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

4566
03:35:41.810 --> 03:35:43.950
<v Speaker 1>You gotta let me pick.</v>

4567

<v Speaker 1>Here's better.</v>

<v Speaker 1>let You pick your parents.</v>

<v Speaker 4>american car in in years right now,</v>

4730
03:44:06.300 --> 03:44:07.320
<v Speaker 4>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 4>beast and it's.</v>

4731
03:44:07.370 --> 03:44:08.203
<v Speaker 4>It's an affordable car comparatively </v>
<v Speaker 4>compared to the kind of performance of </v>

4732
03:44:11.761 --> 03:44:12.594
<v Speaker 4>the other cars like it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Seven minutes and 23 seconds In the </v>

4733
03:44:15.451 --> 03:44:16.284
<v Speaker 4>nuremberg ring.</v>

4734
03:44:16.350 --> 03:44:19.920
<v Speaker 4>That's faster than the nine slash 11 gt </v>
<v Speaker 4>two rs.</v>

4735
03:44:20.190 --> 03:44:23.310
<v Speaker 4>That's just under a mclaren f one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is like,</v>

4736
03:44:23.330 --> 03:44:24.163
<v Speaker 4>well how much is that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a million more than a million and </v>

4737
03:44:26.371 --> 03:44:29.310
<v Speaker 4>just under the a c,</v>
<v Speaker 4>six corvette.</v>

4738
03:44:29.311 --> 03:44:31.950
<v Speaker 4>Z o six.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the dodge viper acr.</v>

4739
03:44:32.130 --> 03:44:36.630
<v Speaker 4>So it's like one second,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one second point seven under the a dodge</v>

4740
03:44:36.631 --> 03:44:40.380

<v Speaker 4>The point,</v>

4742
03:44:43.800 --> 03:44:46.400
<v Speaker 4>I mean the difference between one second</v>
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>

<v Speaker 4>fun.</v>

4748

<v Speaker 1>This party thing,</v>

4917
03:52:56.011 --> 03:52:59.710
<v Speaker 1>we should throw like a really cool party</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we'd want to be at the event.</v>

4918
03:52:59.880 --> 03:53:04.560
<v Speaker 1>If there's somebody that does class </v>
<v Speaker 1>clearly when there's obviously like some</v>

4919
03:53:04.561 --> 03:53:08.220
<v Speaker 1>spin that it's me that you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>win a 100 percent,</v>

4920
03:53:09.120 --> 03:53:11.730
<v Speaker 1>98 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see,</v>

4921
03:53:11.910 --> 03:53:12.900
<v Speaker 1>well what are you going to win?</v>

4922
03:53:12.960 --> 03:53:14.090
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How would you,</v>

4923
03:53:14.100 --> 03:53:15.120
<v Speaker 1>when we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we all do it,</v>

4924
03:53:15.150 --> 03:53:17.240
<v Speaker 1>I think ari's going to tap out with </v>
<v Speaker 1>yoga.</v>

4925
03:53:17.400 --> 03:53:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Probably true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this is the thing.</v>

4926
03:53:18.721 --> 03:53:19.554
<v Speaker 1>This is the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a thought process that would allow </v>

4927
03:53:21.541 --> 03:53:24.810
<v Speaker 1>you to jump ahead and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to win.</v>

4928
03:53:25.030 --> 03:53:28.380
<v Speaker 1>We don't even know what winning is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why this is so ridiculous.</v>

4929
03:53:28.530 --> 03:53:30.330
<v Speaker 1>Like if winning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we both do it,</v>

4930
03:53:30.360 --> 03:53:32.100
<v Speaker 1>how are you going to beat me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How you believe me?</v>

4931
03:53:32.280 --> 03:53:34.080
<v Speaker 1>I think they think you're going to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

4936
03:53:45.120 --> 03:53:47.640
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the option.</v>

4937
03:53:47.890 --> 03:53:48.723
<v Speaker 1>You said that you're going to win and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how could you win and why would you be </v>

4938
03:53:50.551 --> 03:53:51.384
<v Speaker 1>so quick to jump to the idea that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would win groomed carefully considering </v>

5048
03:58:38.691 --> 03:58:40.940
<v Speaker 1>short list for what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My netflix special,</v>

5049
03:58:40.941 --> 03:58:41.860
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

5050
03:58:41.900 --> 03:58:44.060
<v Speaker 1>my shortlist is austin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

5051
03:58:44.061 --> 03:58:46.820
<v Speaker 1>at cap city comedy club,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boston.</v>

5052
03:58:46.821 --> 03:58:47.654
<v Speaker 1>The wilbur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm thinking a couple of other </v>

5053
03:58:49.761 --> 03:58:51.140
<v Speaker 1>places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of small places,</v>

5054
03:58:51.200 --> 03:58:52.033
<v Speaker 1>but those are the two places I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking leaning more towards comedy </v>

5055
03:58:53.841 --> 03:58:54.674
<v Speaker 1>club,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the wilbur is like three comedy </v>

5056
03:58:55.971 --> 03:58:59.030
<v Speaker 1>clubs stacked on top of each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The wilbur is like very deep,</v>

5057
03:58:59.270 --> 03:59:01.730
<v Speaker 1>are very shallow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather it's only 300 seats,</v>

5058
03:59:02.030 --> 03:59:04.090
<v Speaker 1>three floors of 300 seats of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5059
03:59:04.160 --> 03:59:05.690

<v Speaker 1>january.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I might go with you just to see what </v>

5063
03:59:15.351 --> 03:59:16.184
<v Speaker 1>it's like to watch a set there feeling </v>
<v Speaker 1>good because I have to make a decision </v>

5064
03:59:19.130 --> 03:59:21.800
<v Speaker 1>somewhere around january is when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to make the decision where I want</v>

5065
03:59:21.801 --> 03:59:22.550
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>

5066
03:59:22.550 --> 03:59:25.130
<v Speaker 1>I will say if you do it at a club,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep me in mind.</v>

5067
03:59:25.380 --> 03:59:27.620
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm doing my specialist,</v>

5068
03:59:27.640 --> 03:59:31.010

<v Speaker 1>Trocadero philadelphia.</v>

5069
03:59:31.520 --> 03:59:33.460
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trocadero theatre and places.</v>

5070
03:59:33.960 --> 03:59:34.793
<v Speaker 1>It's got a lot of lIke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom and I had a great conversation when </v>

5071
03:59:38.691 --> 03:59:39.850
<v Speaker 1>you did the truck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5072
03:59:40.100 --> 03:59:42.530
<v Speaker 1>People said tom couldn't sell a ticket </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he sold.</v>

5073
03:59:43.920 --> 03:59:46.350
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did I think four or five.</v>

5074
03:59:46.800 --> 03:59:48.020
<v Speaker 1>Five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think.</v>

5075
03:59:48.021 --> 03:59:49.750
<v Speaker 1>Five shows of the truck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

5076
03:59:49.910 --> 03:59:52.150
<v Speaker 1>philly's an epic comedy city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking amazing.</v>

5077
03:59:52.190 --> 03:59:54.660
<v Speaker 1>Epic commentary to five shows the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tropical,</v>

5078
03:59:54.670 --> 03:59:57.170
<v Speaker 1>I think it was four or five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember whose five.</v>

5079
03:59:57.380 --> 03:59:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Trust me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know your story better than you do.</v>

5080
04:00:00.240 --> 04:00:01.190
<v Speaker 1>It's impressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

5081
04:00:01.460 --> 04:00:03.470
<v Speaker 1>They have helium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the best in the country.</v>

5082
04:00:03.490 --> 04:00:04.880
<v Speaker 1>That's great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clips on the spot.</v>

5083
04:00:04.910 --> 04:00:07.400
<v Speaker 1>Thinking of going in and out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe that's another spot we can do.</v>

5084
04:00:07.410 --> 04:00:09.110
<v Speaker 1>Especially you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Especially helium.</v>

5085
04:00:09.590 --> 04:00:13.170
<v Speaker 1>That could be real helium so hard with </v>
<v Speaker 1>paramount.</v>

5086
04:00:13.280 --> 04:00:15.910
<v Speaker 1>It can be the cameras that there's no </v>
<v Speaker 1>seats.</v>

5087
04:00:15.920 --> 04:00:19.160
<v Speaker 1>You have to lose in such a tight space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you though with today,</v>

5088
04:00:19.170 --> 04:00:20.280
<v Speaker 1>with what they can do today</v>

5089
04:00:20.280 --> 04:00:21.520
<v Speaker 4>with cameras,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

5090
04:00:21.530 --> 04:00:25.800
<v Speaker 4>if you could really like put a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>small cameras up on the wall,</v>

5091
04:00:25.860 --> 04:00:26.693
<v Speaker 4>mounted on the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>get all your footage and then decide </v>

5092
04:00:29.251 --> 04:00:30.084
<v Speaker 4>what you pick and the only reason why </v>
<v Speaker 4>you would move from the center shot is </v>

5093
04:00:33.511 --> 04:00:36.300
<v Speaker 4>if someone gets in front of it and then </v>
<v Speaker 4>you have to really strongly.</v>

5094
04:00:36.301 --> 04:00:38.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this is what real problem.</v>

5095
04:00:38.290 --> 04:00:40.410
<v Speaker 4>You can spend,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say four or $500,000.</v>

5096
04:00:40.580 --> 04:00:41.550
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hold on.</v>

5097
04:00:41.551 --> 04:00:44.420
<v Speaker 4>Hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me bounce.</v>

5098
04:00:44.430 --> 04:00:46.560
<v Speaker 4>This is my feeling on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>on standup,</v>

5099
04:00:46.590 --> 04:00:48.350
<v Speaker 4>on television.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now as a stance,</v>

5100
04:00:48.351 --> 04:00:49.184
<v Speaker 4>I feel like when you're watching someone</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the audience are sitting there and </v>

5101
04:00:52.081 --> 04:00:52.914
<v Speaker 4>you're watching them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're seeing them like from the waist </v>

5102
04:00:54.331 --> 04:00:55.080
<v Speaker 4>up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right,</v>

5103
04:00:55.080 --> 04:00:57.030
<v Speaker 4>or close to it at the store,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like that,</v>

5104
04:00:57.031 --> 04:00:59.300
<v Speaker 4>which is a perfect environment at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ice house,</v>

5105
04:00:59.340 --> 04:01:00.810
<v Speaker 4>same deal,</v>
<v Speaker 4>perfect environment.</v>

5106
04:01:01.230 --> 04:01:02.370
<v Speaker 4>ThAt's how you should watch it at home.</v>

5107
04:01:02.430 --> 04:01:04.470
<v Speaker 4>You actually watch it flat on with no </v>
<v Speaker 4>edits.</v>

5108
04:01:04.620 --> 04:01:05.453
<v Speaker 4>The only time I think you should ever so</v>
<v Speaker 4>side to side as if you have to edit </v>

5109
04:01:07.321 --> 04:01:08.154
<v Speaker 4>something or if someone's doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>something that's odd because we want to </v>

5110
04:01:10.441 --> 04:01:13.100
<v Speaker 4>see from a does it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't get boring and I watched.</v>

5111
04:01:13.700 --> 04:01:15.540
<v Speaker 4>It doesn't get boring when I was doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>watch.</v>

5112
04:01:15.660 --> 04:01:16.380
<v Speaker 4>Stand up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're.</v>

5113
04:01:16.380 --> 04:01:19.140
<v Speaker 4>You're automatically on its own shifts </v>
<v Speaker 4>back and forth.</v>

5114
04:01:19.350 --> 04:01:22.050
<v Speaker 4>You get to choose what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You look over the piano guy,</v>

5115
04:01:22.530 --> 04:01:24.540
<v Speaker 4>you're not looking straight on at the </v>
<v Speaker 4>stage the whole time.</v>

5116
04:01:25.110 --> 04:01:28.530
<v Speaker 4>As long as what they're saying is funny </v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's good and they're locked into it</v>

5117
04:01:29.100 --> 04:01:29.933
<v Speaker 4>and do it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that's the best way to do </v>

5118
04:01:31.141 --> 04:01:33.540
<v Speaker 4>it because you knew you're conscious of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the fact that changing angles.</v>

5119
04:01:33.870 --> 04:01:36.060
<v Speaker 4>Why does that enhance the bit?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it does.</v>

5120
04:01:36.290 --> 04:01:39.000
<v Speaker 4>I thought that it does because they do </v>
<v Speaker 4>that with everything else,</v>

5121
04:01:39.001 --> 04:01:40.980
<v Speaker 4>like music videos,</v>
<v Speaker 4>rock and roll,</v>

5122
04:01:40.981 --> 04:01:41.814
<v Speaker 4>concerts.</v>

5123
04:01:41.880 --> 04:01:42.713
<v Speaker 4>Anything that people do,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they go at it from different angles </v>

5124
04:01:43.921 --> 04:01:45.540
<v Speaker 4>because it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'll sort of stimulate your mind,</v>

5125
04:01:45.780 --> 04:01:47.910
<v Speaker 4>but I don't think if you went to see a </v>
<v Speaker 4>standup comic,</v>

5126
04:01:48.110 --> 04:01:51.870
<v Speaker 4>you go see joey d as in dog or you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>watching them head on and it's perfect.</v>

5127
04:01:51.871 --> 04:01:55.260
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes you're looking at his waist.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes you're looking at his belly in</v>

5128
04:01:55.320 --> 04:01:56.250
<v Speaker 4>his eyes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can do that.</v>

5129
04:01:56.251 --> 04:01:57.084
<v Speaker 4>When you watched him from the waist up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can do that if you're watching them </v>

5130
04:01:59.011 --> 04:02:01.250
<v Speaker 4>from where the head of the eu arguing </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you should tell him.</v>

5131
04:02:01.590 --> 04:02:03.600
<v Speaker 4>I think you should have different </v>
<v Speaker 4>angles.</v>

5132
04:02:03.750 --> 04:02:05.070
<v Speaker 4>Someone wants different angles.</v>

5133
04:02:06.790 --> 04:02:11.790
<v Speaker 5>I just pay for this myself and I can </v>
<v Speaker 5>tell you from me going like,</v>

5134
04:02:13.061 --> 04:02:15.670
<v Speaker 5>I've been on tv for awhile and I know </v>
<v Speaker 5>what I'm doing.</v>

5135
04:02:16.180 --> 04:02:19.000
<v Speaker 5>I still got a plethora of cameras,</v>
<v Speaker 5>including a jib.</v>

5136
04:02:19.360 --> 04:02:21.100
<v Speaker 5>Even for some time.</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't want a job.</v>

5137
04:02:21.101 --> 04:02:24.130
<v Speaker 5>I bought it already.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I already paid plans around like a drone</v>

5138
04:02:24.910 --> 04:02:28.190
<v Speaker 5>at the comedy works.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I couldn't do it,</v>

5139
04:02:28.680 --> 04:02:33.680
<v Speaker 5>bro.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Manage on pilot,</v>

5140
04:02:35.261 --> 04:02:36.760
<v Speaker 5>but you're good.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm super serious.</v>

5141
04:02:38.290 --> 04:02:41.680
<v Speaker 5>Super serious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Super serious,</v>

5142
04:02:42.430 --> 04:02:43.910
<v Speaker 5>super serious.</v>
