<v Speaker 1>we absolutely appreciate it.</v>

25
00:01:18.661 --> 00:01:23.661

32
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.450
<v Speaker 1>street as you take the fucking bill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you drink coconut water and you jerk off</v>

33
00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:41.900
<v Speaker 1>into the cup and you look in the Cup </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards.</v>

34
00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.920
<v Speaker 1>That's fucking mind boggling right </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

35
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.360
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

36
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.100
<v Speaker 1>that's the fucking deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you take the two pills?</v>

37
00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:48.200
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>CEO.</v>

38
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.560
<v Speaker 1>We're also a.</v>

39
00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.070
<v Speaker 1>We make a shrewd anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so people that have been asking for more</v>

40
00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:53.820
<v Speaker 1>tests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tests,</v>

41
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.310
<v Speaker 1>so we're on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to work.</v>

42
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.290
<v Speaker 1>We're spending a lot of money to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>sure that this stuff is all legit.</v>

43
00:01:58.291 --> 00:01:59.700
<v Speaker 1>It is legit for me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I use it.</v>

44
00:01:59.701 --> 00:02:02.130
<v Speaker 1>It works without a doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No questions for me.</v>

45
00:02:02.131 --> 00:02:03.480
<v Speaker 1>I've tried it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten off of it.</v>

46
00:02:03.481 --> 00:02:08.481
<v Speaker 1>I've tried it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've fucked with myself as much as </v>

47
00:02:08.481 --> 00:02:08.481
<v Speaker 1>possible to see it placebo effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not there,</v>

48
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.670
<v Speaker 1>it's legit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I also love shroom Tech Sport,</v>

49
00:02:11.671 --> 00:02:13.440
<v Speaker 1>which is the [inaudible] mushroom </v>
<v Speaker 1>supplement,</v>

50
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.580
<v Speaker 1>a supplement that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

51
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.610
<v Speaker 1>it aids your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body's aids in your body's ability </v>

52
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.071
<v Speaker 1>to process oxygen really makes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference in any extreme exercise.</v>

53
00:02:22.591 --> 00:02:27.591
<v Speaker 1>If you're into Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you take like Kettlebell classes are </v>

54
00:02:27.591 --> 00:02:30.120
<v Speaker 1>into crossfit or anything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will definitely find an advantage.</v>

55
00:02:30.121 --> 00:02:33.000
<v Speaker 1>You will definitely feel an effect of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the shroom tech sport,</v>

56
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:38.001
<v Speaker 1>but if you just like a regular person </v>
<v Speaker 1>who doesn't exercise or you barely </v>

57
00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:38.001
<v Speaker 1>exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

58
00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:38.510
<v Speaker 1>don't waste your money back.</v>

59
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.420
<v Speaker 1>If you also go to [inaudible] dot com,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we also have a shroom tech immune which </v>

60
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.920
<v Speaker 1>everyone should check out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fascinating and the way it works,</v>

61
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.130
<v Speaker 1>the way it's been explained to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm obviously no scientist,</v>

62
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.660
<v Speaker 1>but your body recognizes this mushroom </v>
<v Speaker 1>different mushrooms than the shrimp tech</v>

63
00:02:54.661 --> 00:02:59.661
<v Speaker 1>support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your body recognizes it as a possible </v>

64
00:02:59.661 --> 00:03:02.480
<v Speaker 1>disease or a cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so your immune system fires up for a </v>

65
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.491
<v Speaker 1>fight that never takes place and so just</v>
<v Speaker 1>really generally boost your immune </v>

66
00:03:05.491 --> 00:03:05.491
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

67
00:03:05.491 --> 00:03:09.450
<v Speaker 1>I am a big believer in a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different things to keep your immune </v>

68
00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:10.090
<v Speaker 1>system strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a big believer in this room,</v>

69
00:03:10.091 --> 00:03:15.091
<v Speaker 1>tech immune,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm also a big believer in </v>

70
00:03:15.091 --> 00:03:15.091
<v Speaker 1>probiotics and everyone should look into</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

71
00:03:15.091 --> 00:03:18.130
<v Speaker 1>I have no financial stake in this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but drink a Kombucha tea.</v>

72
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.800
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people have been,</v>

73
00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.860
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just just talking so highly about the </v>

74
00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:26.770
<v Speaker 1>benefits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the health benefits of this stuff,</v>

75
00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for years and years.</v>

76
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.370
<v Speaker 1>And I never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did it when I first came to la.</v>

77
00:03:30.371 --> 00:03:31.240
<v Speaker 1>I tried it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I was like,</v>

78
00:03:31.241 --> 00:03:34.180
<v Speaker 1>the stuff tastes kind of nasty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a weird sort of an acquired taste.</v>

79
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.250
<v Speaker 1>But then about a year or two years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I started drinking it on a regular basis</v>

80
00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:44.251
<v Speaker 1>because gts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kombucha and they make synergy and all </v>

81
00:03:44.251 --> 00:03:44.251
<v Speaker 1>these different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

82
00:03:44.251 --> 00:03:48.510
<v Speaker 1>different flavors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They started selling them at whole </v>

83
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.510
<v Speaker 1>foods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was like super easy to buy.</v>

84
00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.120
<v Speaker 1>And I started drinking them all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

85
00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:51.490
<v Speaker 1>And one thing I noticed is I stopped </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting sick.</v>

86
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.850
<v Speaker 1>I think it has a big difference when you</v>
<v Speaker 1>take in a live organisms like </v>

87
00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.050
<v Speaker 1>probiotics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's Acidophilus,</v>

88
00:03:59.051 --> 00:04:04.051
<v Speaker 1>that's another great one to take and </v>
<v Speaker 1>spend the money and get that shit that </v>

89
00:04:04.051 --> 00:04:06.961
<v Speaker 1>you have to keep in your refrigerator if</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can afford it because that's what </v>

90
00:04:06.961 --> 00:04:07.330
<v Speaker 1>you really want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're really healthy live cultures and</v>

91
00:04:07.331 --> 00:04:12.331
<v Speaker 1>essentially what it does is you know </v>
<v Speaker 1>these live cultures act as a security </v>

92
00:04:12.331 --> 00:04:13.630
<v Speaker 1>force and they fight off all the country</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultures,</v>

93
00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.240
<v Speaker 1>so any any country bacteria that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>come across,</v>

94
00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:21.390
<v Speaker 1>you want to have these probiotics at </v>
<v Speaker 1>your beck and call like a live army to </v>

95
00:04:21.641 --> 00:04:26.641
<v Speaker 1>fight off the cons of the disease world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so look at it that way and this is by </v>

96
00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:26.710
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing that we sell,</v>

97
00:04:26.711 --> 00:04:29.160
<v Speaker 1>but get your ass on some acidophilus.</v>

98
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.040
<v Speaker 1>Get your ass on some Kombucha tea </v>
<v Speaker 1>checkout.</v>

99
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:37.290
<v Speaker 1>We also have a new mood which they five </v>
<v Speaker 1>htp enhancement supplement and what that</v>

100
00:04:38.171 --> 00:04:40.480
<v Speaker 1>is is a five htp actually helps your </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain,</v>

101
00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.650
<v Speaker 1>builds serotonin and interesting stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were on antidepressants,</v>

102
00:04:44.651 --> 00:04:49.651
<v Speaker 1>they recommend you not take it because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it actually can give you too much </v>

103
00:04:49.651 --> 00:04:50.110
<v Speaker 1>serotonin along with your </v>
<v Speaker 1>antidepressants together.</v>

104
00:04:50.111 --> 00:04:55.111
<v Speaker 1>Combined is not so good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so talk to your doctor and all that </v>

105
00:04:55.111 --> 00:04:55.111
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by itself,</v>

106
00:04:55.111 --> 00:04:56.710
<v Speaker 1>if you're not on any medication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely safe.</v>

107
00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.380
<v Speaker 1>Just don't go crazy and take the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>bottle in one sitting.</v>

108
00:04:59.381 --> 00:05:01.360
<v Speaker 1>You fucking freak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're on cocaine today.</v>

109
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.750
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

110
00:05:01.751 --> 00:05:03.820
<v Speaker 1>I'm healthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm healthy and working out.</v>

111
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.590
<v Speaker 1>I've been working out for the first time</v>
<v Speaker 1>in months,</v>

112
00:05:05.591 --> 00:05:07.090
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

<v Speaker 1>I did.</v>

115
00:05:09.821 --> 00:05:11.230
<v Speaker 1>I kicked the bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a fucking.</v>

116
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:12.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm back.</v>

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:14.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

118
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.550
<v Speaker 1>go to [inaudible] Dot com o n I n o n n </v>
<v Speaker 1>I t o n n I t.com</v>

119
00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:23.320
<v Speaker 1>entering the codename Rogan and you will</v>
<v Speaker 1>get 10 percent off.</v>

120
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:28.410
<v Speaker 1>Most importantly when you order every </v>
<v Speaker 1>order that you get is 100 percent money </v>

121
00:05:29.111 --> 00:05:31.690
<v Speaker 1>back guarantee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but only for the first 30 pills.</v>

122
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:36.840
<v Speaker 1>And he say why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He used to be 100 percent guarantee all </v>

123
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.840
<v Speaker 1>the time because the world is full of </v>
<v Speaker 1>concrete.</v>

124
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:40.920
<v Speaker 1>That's why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And because some douchebag thought it'd </v>

125
00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.410
<v Speaker 1>be cool to odor a fuck load of bottles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get all of his money back and then sell </v>

126
00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:44.290
<v Speaker 1>the bottles on Ebay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So because of the cost of the world,</v>

127
00:05:44.291 --> 00:05:46.900
<v Speaker 1>even as you make a big order and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>decide somewhere along the line that you</v>

128
00:05:46.901 --> 00:05:48.370
<v Speaker 1>don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't get your money back.</v>

129
00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.820
<v Speaker 1>So if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you do want your money back and it's </v>

130
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.711
<v Speaker 1>a big order,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to send in the unopened </v>

131
00:05:55.711 --> 00:05:57.271
<v Speaker 1>bottles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first 30 pills though you can eat </v>

132
00:05:57.271 --> 00:05:57.271
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can stuff them up your ass,</v>

133
00:05:57.271 --> 00:05:58.060
<v Speaker 1>you can throw them in the toilet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck you want</v>

134
00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:03.060
<v Speaker 2>to do with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then tell us I don't like it and we </v>

135
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:03.290
<v Speaker 2>give you all your money back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

136
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.680
<v Speaker 2>Because I'm in a weird position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a position where people are like,</v>

137
00:06:06.681 --> 00:06:09.230
<v Speaker 2>what do you try to rip people off?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely fucking not.</v>

138
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:14.260
<v Speaker 2>But I do believe in this stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's only one way to sell </v>

139
00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:14.260
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You believe in it.</v>

140
00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:17.840
<v Speaker 2>You got to sell it and make it as easy </v>
<v Speaker 2>as possible for everybody.</v>

141
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:22.160
<v Speaker 2>And make your intentions as positive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as clear as possible,</v>

142
00:06:22.161 --> 00:06:27.161
<v Speaker 2>and I don't think you can be any clear </v>
<v Speaker 2>than offering someone 100 percent of </v>

143
00:06:27.161 --> 00:06:27.620
<v Speaker 2>their money back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If they don't like the product,</v>

144
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.140
<v Speaker 2>you don't have to send it in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to do shit.</v>

145
00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:32.660
<v Speaker 2>Just if you the first 30 pills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just take them.</v>

146
00:06:32.750 --> 00:06:34.430
<v Speaker 2>And then if you don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you get your money back.</v>

147
00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:36.380
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think it's too expensive,</v>

148
00:06:36.381 --> 00:06:38.390
<v Speaker 2>I urge you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to the website.</v>

<v Speaker 2>pound division because he's not a </v>

192
00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:35.450
<v Speaker 2>champion yet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he might be one of the top pound for</v>

193
00:08:35.451 --> 00:08:37.310
<v Speaker 2>pound guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's right up there with Aldo.</v>

197
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:51.790
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of that thing where they lift </v>

198
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:51.790
<v Speaker 2>the front leg and then they come up with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the right leg.</v>

199
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:55.630
<v Speaker 2>They'll start with the left leg and then</v>
<v Speaker 2>they use it as forced to kick up with </v>

200
00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:58.640
<v Speaker 2>the right leg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of these bad ass Brazilians like </v>

<v Speaker 2>Anderson can do it too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they just fly through the air with</v>

202
00:08:59.851 --> 00:09:04.230
<v Speaker 2>one knee and just lifted that knee up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and crack caught.</v>

203
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.750
<v Speaker 2>Caught Brad Pickett in the chin.</v>

<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

206
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:13.230
<v Speaker 2>as soon as Brad Pickett,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like stumbled and he saw position,</v>

207
00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:15.480
<v Speaker 2>he'd jumped on that back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So quick man.</v>

208
00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.000
<v Speaker 2>It was a thing of beauty man.</v>

209
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:21.720
<v Speaker 3>I saw the UFC special on Nick Diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Carlos condit.</v>

210
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.270

<v Speaker 3>Episode two.</v>

212
00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:31.280
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's aired yet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is it the one where they haven't been </v>

213
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:34.710
<v Speaker 3>years like kindergarten teacher.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She remembered neck.</v>

214
00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:36.920
<v Speaker 3>Remember Nick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this is.</v>

215
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:42.110
<v Speaker 3>I learned a lot about nick and I come up</v>
<v Speaker 3>with a hypothesis.</v>

216
00:09:42.630 --> 00:09:46.260
<v Speaker 3>You know before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when was in the early days if you were a</v>

217
00:09:46.261 --> 00:09:47.760
<v Speaker 3>black belt in Jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

218
00:09:47.761 --> 00:09:51.810
<v Speaker 3>you had a shot at the title and then it </v>
<v Speaker 3>became if you were an Olympic wrestler,</v>

219
00:09:51.811 --> 00:09:56.811
<v Speaker 3>damn you have a shot at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now it's obvious now it's becoming more </v>

220
00:09:56.811 --> 00:09:58.260
<v Speaker 3>like all other sports,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if you didn't wrestle,</v>

221
00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:03.290
<v Speaker 3>do Jiu Jitsu and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and worked on striking since day one as </v>

222
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:03.290
<v Speaker 3>a kid.</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>

223
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:05.190
<v Speaker 3>There's so many kids doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All three now.</v>

224
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:10.460
<v Speaker 3>You don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to have a shot in the </v>

225
00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:10.460
<v Speaker 3>very near future.</v>

226
00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.120
<v Speaker 3>And I think there's one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's one more factor,</v>

227
00:10:12.390 --> 00:10:17.390
<v Speaker 3>and that's the Nick Diaz factor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's obviously he doesn't like </v>

228
00:10:17.390 --> 00:10:17.600
<v Speaker 3>cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's,</v>

229
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:22.690
<v Speaker 3>he said it a million times.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't like to talk in front of </v>

230
00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:22.690
<v Speaker 3>cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's not,</v>

231
00:10:22.690 --> 00:10:22.850
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

232
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:23.790
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

233
00:10:23.850 --> 00:10:24.480
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's,</v>

234
00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:28.350
<v Speaker 3>he's not into it and maybe he shy in </v>
<v Speaker 3>front of the camera or whatever.</v>

235
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:33.470
<v Speaker 3>And his teacher was even saying that he </v>
<v Speaker 3>wasn't the most vocal guy and,</v>

236
00:10:33.681 --> 00:10:38.681
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and he had trouble expressing himself </v>

237
00:10:38.681 --> 00:10:39.400
<v Speaker 3>and all that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

238
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:44.040
<v Speaker 3>when he gets in that cage and that door </v>
<v Speaker 3>slammed shut and the crowd is roaring,</v>

239
00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.550
<v Speaker 3>there's no more fucking talking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He just comes alive.</v>

240
00:10:47.551 --> 00:10:51.030
<v Speaker 3>He looks at his opponent is like nobody </v>
<v Speaker 3>can fucking hear you.</v>

241
00:10:51.090 --> 00:10:53.220
<v Speaker 3>You can be the most articulate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>funny,</v>

242
00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:56.100
<v Speaker 3>charismatic guy on the fucking planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know what?</v>

243
00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.580
<v Speaker 3>I fucking run all day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Swim all day,</v>

244
00:10:59.790 --> 00:11:02.670
<v Speaker 3>do box.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a crazy Chen.</v>

245
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:05.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna fucking kill this </v>
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker.</v>

246
00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:07.980
<v Speaker 3>That's like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's an x factor right there.</v>

247
00:11:07.981 --> 00:11:10.860
<v Speaker 3>If you didn't like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to look for that.</v>

248
00:11:10.861 --> 00:11:15.000
<v Speaker 3>I think in the future in fighters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like do they have that switch where when</v>

249
00:11:15.001 --> 00:11:17.400
<v Speaker 3>they fucking get in that cage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just,</v>

250
00:11:17.401 --> 00:11:19.700
<v Speaker 3>it really is like life or death.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His is a very good,</v>

251
00:11:19.701 --> 00:11:19.720
<v Speaker 3>a</v>

252
00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:21.890
<v Speaker 2>different thing than anybody else's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all.</v>

253
00:11:21.891 --> 00:11:26.891
<v Speaker 2>His approach to it is so different than </v>
<v Speaker 2>anybody else's in that he does like </v>

254
00:11:26.891 --> 00:11:30.070
<v Speaker 2>endurance training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like long distance marathon type </v>

255
00:11:30.070 --> 00:11:32.210
<v Speaker 2>training and basically forces these guys</v>
<v Speaker 2>to try to keep up with them.</v>

256
00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:37.660
<v Speaker 2>I mean he basically puts them into an </v>
<v Speaker 2>endurance contest and tries to get them </v>

257
00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:40.571
<v Speaker 2>to keep up with them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why he does a lot of juking and </v>

258
00:11:40.571 --> 00:11:40.700
<v Speaker 2>lot of getting in their face.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All that stuff tenses you up,</v>

259
00:11:40.701 --> 00:11:43.790
<v Speaker 2>all that stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All those punches that he throws at 50,</v>

260
00:11:43.791 --> 00:11:46.220
<v Speaker 2>60 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those tighten you up.</v>

261
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:51.310
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the things that frank shamrock </v>

262
00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:51.310
<v Speaker 2>said was that when,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when Nick Diaz was punching me,</v>

263
00:11:51.310 --> 00:11:51.890
<v Speaker 2>pitch you so often you can't breathe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know when to breathe.</v>

264
00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.610
<v Speaker 2>You can't relax because you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you never get to relax because they're,</v>

265
00:11:54.611 --> 00:11:55.840
<v Speaker 2>they're just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just keep coming,</v>

266
00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:57.070
<v Speaker 2>which is just different.</v>

267
00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.080
<v Speaker 2>He just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he just fights in a different way.</v>

268
00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:04.260
<v Speaker 2>I think the way it does it is brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so brilliant because no one else </v>

269
00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:05.080
<v Speaker 2>did it before him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one else figured out that that way to</v>

270
00:12:05.081 --> 00:12:09.430
<v Speaker 2>fight no one else really would not just </v>
<v Speaker 2>have great skills,</v>

271
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:14.620
<v Speaker 2>but have ridiculous worldclass endurance</v>
<v Speaker 2>like swim from Alcatraz endurance.</v>

272
00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.740
<v Speaker 2>That's the shit man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said they went through a countdown.</v>

273
00:12:17.830 --> 00:12:22.830
<v Speaker 2>He sparked like some ridiculous amount </v>
<v Speaker 2>of rounds that he ran five miles and </v>

274
00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:25.120
<v Speaker 2>then he swam for an hour and a half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was just one day.</v>

275
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:30.900
<v Speaker 2>He just does that all day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You still maybe maybe he has some kind </v>

276
00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.310
<v Speaker 2>of condition where he's obsessed with </v>
<v Speaker 2>exercise.</v>

277
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:34.330
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

278
00:12:34.331 --> 00:12:35.610
<v Speaker 2>I think he loves it for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

279
00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:37.060
<v Speaker 2>when he was a kid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he said that he,</v>

280
00:12:37.061 --> 00:12:37.510
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

281
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.610
<v Speaker 2>I think he said it was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>countdown shows.</v>

282
00:12:39.611 --> 00:12:39.930
<v Speaker 2>His,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

283
00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:40.780
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

284
00:12:40.781 --> 00:12:44.230
<v Speaker 2>think it was his uncle or someone was </v>
<v Speaker 2>like a track coach.</v>

285
00:12:44.231 --> 00:12:45.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He used to take him,</v>

286
00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:46.750
<v Speaker 2>his grandfather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Danny.</v>

287
00:12:46.751 --> 00:12:47.710
<v Speaker 2>Proper ghosts.</v>

288
00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:50.680
<v Speaker 4>But that's the other thing too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The other thing too with him,</v>

289
00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:52.930
<v Speaker 4>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't like fucking talking.</v>

290
00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:54.610
<v Speaker 4>You smoke a joint.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you feel like?</v>

291
00:12:54.611 --> 00:12:56.470
<v Speaker 4>Do I go for a fucking run?</v>
<v Speaker 4>See what happens to you.</v>

292
00:12:56.471 --> 00:12:57.730
<v Speaker 4>It feels great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It feels great.</v>

293
00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.790
<v Speaker 4>It feels open.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joint.</v>

294
00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:03.820
<v Speaker 4>I go to fucking swim fit for an hour </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you feel like fucking Hercules' </v>

295
00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:03.820
<v Speaker 4>when you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's my world.</v>

296
00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:05.770

<v Speaker 4>Smokes weed.</v>

297
00:13:05.970 --> 00:13:08.170
<v Speaker 4>What his insurance comes from from </v>
<v Speaker 4>going,</v>

298
00:13:08.171 --> 00:13:10.690
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to hang out with these dumb</v>
<v Speaker 4>fucks is I might stab somebody.</v>

299
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:12.860
<v Speaker 4>I'll just smoke a joint rental,</v>
<v Speaker 4>left the fucking highway.</v>

<v Speaker 4>And he runs the fucking two hours.</v>

301
00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:20.130
<v Speaker 4>When I lived in boulder,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to smoke and run and the high </v>

302
00:13:20.130 --> 00:13:21.790
<v Speaker 4>when you finish fucking run is a </v>
<v Speaker 4>complete different dimension.</v>

303
00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:23.770
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even when you smoke and lift man,</v>

304
00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:26.650
<v Speaker 4>everyday feel you feel all your muscle </v>
<v Speaker 4>tissue.</v>

305
00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:28.720
<v Speaker 4>Like when he pressing weights,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he feel it.</v>

306
00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:31.100
<v Speaker 4>You feel your whole body moving and </v>
<v Speaker 4>swipe in.</v>

307
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:33.090
<v Speaker 4>At Roland they say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well,</v>

308
00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:37.810
<v Speaker 4>not just at Yoga and smoking the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're supposed to do,</v>

309
00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:42.960
<v Speaker 4>and I used to eat it to take a little </v>
<v Speaker 4>piece of banana bread or a little hash </v>

310
00:13:43.211 --> 00:13:45.200
<v Speaker 4>cookie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I take it in seven in the morning,</v>

311
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:46.210
<v Speaker 4>go to 8:30</v>
<v Speaker 4>years old.</v>

312
00:13:46.211 --> 00:13:47.650
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my head is at 8:30</v>

313
00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:50.410
<v Speaker 4>and the bitches smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

314
00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.320
<v Speaker 4>And I would just go into it little by </v>
<v Speaker 4>little and it's amazing.</v>

315
00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.270
<v Speaker 4>It's fucking amazing when you walk out </v>
<v Speaker 4>of there,</v>

316
00:13:55.271 --> 00:13:57.130
<v Speaker 4>you don't know what agent you really </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't.</v>

317
00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.890
<v Speaker 4>So that's what my thing is with him,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that he just,</v>

318
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.570
<v Speaker 4>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he's not the type of guy that's going to</v>

319
00:14:01.571 --> 00:14:03.130
<v Speaker 4>go to a club or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What would you do?</v>

320
00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:04.000
<v Speaker 4>Smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>smoking.</v>

321
00:14:04.010 --> 00:14:05.580
<v Speaker 4>Joe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's the last guy I'd</v>

322
00:14:05.590 --> 00:14:10.590
<v Speaker 2>want to fight because think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like compare them to GSP and even John </v>

323
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.040
<v Speaker 2>Jones and Anderson Silva that what he </v>
<v Speaker 2>has,</v>

324
00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:19.140
<v Speaker 2>they don't have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe they will develop it is he will </v>

325
00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:23.580
<v Speaker 2>stand right in front of you and exchange</v>
<v Speaker 2>with you and he's down to go to war </v>

326
00:14:23.981 --> 00:14:26.410
<v Speaker 2>right in front of you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

327
00:14:26.411 --> 00:14:27.150
<v Speaker 2>not very.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

328
00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:32.160
<v Speaker 2>GSP ain't gonna do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jon Jones probably won't even do that </v>

329
00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:35.340
<v Speaker 2>and if you decide to take him down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he'll fuck you up on the ground to his </v>

330
00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:35.410
<v Speaker 2>Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

331
00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:40.690
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck are you going to do that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you going to do with Nick Diaz?</v>

332
00:14:40.691 --> 00:14:42.720
<v Speaker 2>And he was killing you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Going to do with him Cyborg.</v>

333
00:14:42.721 --> 00:14:47.721
<v Speaker 2>You was killing sideboards standing up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So sidebar took them down and whip </v>

334
00:14:47.721 --> 00:14:48.310
<v Speaker 2>armbar within 30 seconds he had him in </v>
<v Speaker 2>an arm bar.</v>

335
00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:50.800
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>GSP might be able to take him down.</v>

336
00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:53.180
<v Speaker 2>What is he going to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not going to pass this guard.</v>

337
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:55.600
<v Speaker 2>He's not gonna pass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nick Diaz's guard.</v>

338
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.190
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't get tired when you're on top </v>
<v Speaker 2>of him either.</v>

339
00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:59.450
<v Speaker 2>You know a lot of dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

340
00:14:59.451 --> 00:15:01.430
<v Speaker 2>you put them on their back and they just</v>
<v Speaker 2>get exhausted.</v>

341
00:15:01.431 --> 00:15:06.431
<v Speaker 2>They get demoralized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they get exhausted unless we see his </v>

342
00:15:06.431 --> 00:15:07.960
<v Speaker 2>chin fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

343
00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:09.440
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't see him lose.</v>

344
00:15:09.441 --> 00:15:14.441
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know that can happen to some </v>

345
00:15:14.441 --> 00:15:14.441
<v Speaker 2>fighters when they take beatings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

346
00:15:14.441 --> 00:15:16.310
<v Speaker 2>that can't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've seen it happen over and over.</v>

347
00:15:16.311 --> 00:15:19.100
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and vandelay and so many guys,</v>

348
00:15:19.101 --> 00:15:24.101
<v Speaker 2>chuck eventually that they had iron </v>
<v Speaker 2>chance and they would come even if they </v>

349
00:15:24.101 --> 00:15:25.610
<v Speaker 2>got randomly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>never had an iron chin.</v>

350
00:15:25.611 --> 00:15:27.280
<v Speaker 2>Vandelay got dropped a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Soccer.</v>

351
00:15:27.300 --> 00:15:28.920
<v Speaker 2>Robert dropped him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people dropped them.</v>

352
00:15:28.921 --> 00:15:30.350
<v Speaker 2>Henderson had.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm really badly her.</v>

353
00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:32.240
<v Speaker 2>He just was a lot worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

354
00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.160
<v Speaker 2>It's a lot worse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>arguably,</v>

355
00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:35.950
<v Speaker 2>arguably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

356
00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:39.020
<v Speaker 2>he was already just this dude who ran </v>
<v Speaker 2>face for first.</v>

357
00:15:39.021 --> 00:15:39.510
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he did.</v>

358
00:15:39.511 --> 00:15:41.080
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that made vandelay </v>
<v Speaker 2>great was,</v>

359
00:15:41.081 --> 00:15:42.320
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how reckless he was.</v>

360
00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:43.490
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't give a fuck.</v>

361
00:15:43.491 --> 00:15:45.890
<v Speaker 2>He would charge that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You literally like a wild dog.</v>

362
00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.960
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he built like a pit bull just running at</v>

363
00:15:47.961 --> 00:15:49.550
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that style,</v>

364
00:15:49.551 --> 00:15:51.230
<v Speaker 2>it gets you hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that style.</v>

365
00:15:51.231 --> 00:15:56.231
<v Speaker 2>I mean he's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not a coincidence that he's the </v>

366
00:15:56.231 --> 00:15:59.681
<v Speaker 2>only guy of his era that had to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>facial reconstruction so he could </v>

367
00:15:59.681 --> 00:15:59.681
<v Speaker 2>breathe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

368
00:15:59.681 --> 00:16:01.160
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his nose was flattened,</v>

369
00:16:01.161 --> 00:16:06.161
<v Speaker 2>smashed flat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you go and look at his face from </v>

370
00:16:06.161 --> 00:16:09.461
<v Speaker 2>when he first entered into pride and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then his face in his first UFC fight </v>

371
00:16:09.461 --> 00:16:10.610
<v Speaker 2>with chuck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a completely different person.</v>

372
00:16:10.611 --> 00:16:11.660
<v Speaker 2>You didn't even recognize him.</v>

373
00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:14.720
<v Speaker 2>He was a handsome guy when he first got </v>
<v Speaker 2>into interpride,</v>

374
00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:17.720
<v Speaker 2>who's I have fucking some guy vendelay </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at values.</v>

375
00:16:17.721 --> 00:16:19.220
<v Speaker 2>Hot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty sexy.</v>

376
00:16:20.330 --> 00:16:23.090
<v Speaker 2>I danced with him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he was cute.</v>

377
00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:28.330
<v Speaker 2>He was a sexy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a completely different looking </v>

378
00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:28.330
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

379
00:16:28.330 --> 00:16:28.360
<v Speaker 2>No Kara as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

380
00:16:28.380 --> 00:16:31.690
<v Speaker 2>Gary's face looks way different to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about nate fucking Diaz?</v>

381
00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:34.100
<v Speaker 2>Holy Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's like a carbon capo.</v>

382
00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:36.860
<v Speaker 2>Nick Diaz.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nick Diaz is.</v>

383
00:16:36.861 --> 00:16:39.560
<v Speaker 2>We don't just have one that's fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible.</v>

384
00:16:39.650 --> 00:16:43.160
<v Speaker 2>He was just like maybe a year behind </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nick Diaz sort of in development.</v>

385
00:16:43.161 --> 00:16:48.161
<v Speaker 2>It seemed like maybe in Jujitsu was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little behind and in the striking </v>

386
00:16:48.161 --> 00:16:51.670
<v Speaker 2>striking power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now he's like caught up to nick had </v>

387
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:52.520
<v Speaker 2>some weight problems to where he didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>cut the weight.</v>

388
00:16:52.521 --> 00:16:54.020
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now he cuts it right.</v>

389
00:16:54.170 --> 00:16:57.040
<v Speaker 2>And now he has way more energy because </v>
<v Speaker 2>when he went up to one 70,</v>

390
00:16:57.170 --> 00:17:02.170
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had some fights where he looked bad </v>

391
00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:02.170
<v Speaker 2>ass like the rory mark and fight holy </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

392
00:17:02.170 --> 00:17:02.450
<v Speaker 2>And I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

393
00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:04.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this kid is draining themselves too much</v>

394
00:17:04.431 --> 00:17:07.880
<v Speaker 2>to get down to 55.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then he figured out how to do 55.</v>

395
00:17:07.881 --> 00:17:12.881
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he came in and the goal fight just </v>

396
00:17:12.881 --> 00:17:14.830
<v Speaker 2>fucking lit me up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But serone fight was even more </v>

397
00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:15.380
<v Speaker 2>impressive because he did it for three </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking rounds.</v>

398
00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:18.500
<v Speaker 2>So it shows that he's got endurance at </v>
<v Speaker 2>1:55</v>

399
00:17:18.501 --> 00:17:20.540
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he lit cowboy up.</v>

400
00:17:20.541 --> 00:17:21.350
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that.</v>

401
00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:24.380
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was going to be a crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>close fight.</v>

402
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:26.330
<v Speaker 2>It's like sort of how I feel about this </v>
<v Speaker 2>condit fight.</v>

403
00:17:26.331 --> 00:17:27.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the hell's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

404
00:17:27.471 --> 00:17:28.160
<v Speaker 2>I look at it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

405
00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:30.200
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both guys are tough as fuck.</v>

406
00:17:30.201 --> 00:17:33.950
<v Speaker 2>Both guys have mad skills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both guys can survive.</v>

407
00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.440
<v Speaker 2>Some dudes can't be the nail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

408
00:17:36.441 --> 00:17:39.230
<v Speaker 2>some dudes can be the hammer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when they the nail they fall apart.</v>

409
00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:40.840
<v Speaker 2>Conduct doesn't fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man.</v>

410
00:17:40.841 --> 00:17:45.841
<v Speaker 2>And Connie got bombed on by Jake </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ellenberger ellenberger had him in all </v>

411
00:17:45.841 --> 00:17:47.420
<v Speaker 2>sorts of trouble and ellenberger puts </v>
<v Speaker 2>people away.</v>

412
00:17:47.421 --> 00:17:52.421
<v Speaker 2>That kid hits fucking hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's one of the hardest hitting guys at </v>

413
00:17:52.421 --> 00:17:54.420
<v Speaker 2>one 70.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he bombed condit and conduct,</v>

414
00:17:54.450 --> 00:17:55.950
<v Speaker 2>covered up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weathered the storm,</v>

415
00:17:55.951 --> 00:17:58.380
<v Speaker 2>and came back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was the first fucking around man.</v>

416
00:17:58.530 --> 00:18:03.530
<v Speaker 2>He was in all sorts of trouble in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first round where a lot of lot of </v>

417
00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:03.530
<v Speaker 2>referees would have pulled that trigger </v>
<v Speaker 2>router.</v>

418
00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:07.920
<v Speaker 2>A lot of referees would have stopped </v>
<v Speaker 2>that fight if they didn't respect him </v>

419
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:07.920
<v Speaker 2>and they didn't know him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he was like a new guy into the UFC,</v>

420
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:08.790
<v Speaker 2>how did that fight end?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

421
00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:10.800
<v Speaker 2>he wanted a decision what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A close decision,</v>

422
00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:15.150
<v Speaker 2>but it was a great fucking fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what it proved to me is that conduit</v>

423
00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:18.570
<v Speaker 2>is no front runner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a dude that is in it to win it.</v>

424
00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:23.570
<v Speaker 2>The Rory Macdonald fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another perfect example of that third </v>

425
00:18:23.570 --> 00:18:24.660
<v Speaker 2>round came back and stopped him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lost the first two rounds,</v>

426
00:18:24.661 --> 00:18:25.980
<v Speaker 2>came back in the third round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped them.</v>

427
00:18:25.981 --> 00:18:28.980
<v Speaker 2>And that kid is a fucking phenol man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That Rory Macdonald,</v>

428
00:18:28.981 --> 00:18:30.470
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a fucking elbow.</v>

429
00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.180
<v Speaker 2>He got it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He crushed them on the ground.</v>

430
00:18:33.181 --> 00:18:34.860
<v Speaker 2>He broke his face open on the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

431
00:18:34.861 --> 00:18:36.300
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>contents on animal.</v>

432
00:18:36.301 --> 00:18:39.780
<v Speaker 2>He's a real fucking killer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guys is straight killer.</v>

433
00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:42.330
<v Speaker 2>What he said in that countdown show was </v>
<v Speaker 2>bad ass.</v>

434
00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:47.480
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want the rest of the referee to </v>

435
00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:49.041
<v Speaker 2>rescue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want the referee to come in and save </v>

436
00:18:49.041 --> 00:18:49.041
<v Speaker 2>your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Save your fucking life,</v>

437
00:18:49.041 --> 00:18:53.331
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's the way to do things like </v>

438
00:18:53.331 --> 00:18:53.331
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That that's a killer man.</v>

439
00:18:53.331 --> 00:18:54.030
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if he wasn't doing this,</v>

440
00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:57.590
<v Speaker 2>he would be somewhere working for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>military that I wrote.</v>

441
00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:58.780
<v Speaker 2>I always said that about him.</v>

442
00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:00.850
<v Speaker 2>He's a killer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a fucking kill him.</v>

443
00:19:00.851 --> 00:19:02.970
<v Speaker 2>And that natural born killer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's not just a nickname.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you kidding me,</v>

461
00:19:46.441 --> 00:19:47.510
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both peers.</v>

462
00:19:48.050 --> 00:19:49.740
<v Speaker 2>Peers is dangerous for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's why.</v>

463
00:19:49.770 --> 00:19:52.140
<v Speaker 2>He's one of those guys that eventually </v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to catch on.</v>

464
00:19:52.270 --> 00:19:57.270
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually pierce is going to hit his </v>

465
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.270
<v Speaker 2>stride and he is going to be Johnny </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hendricks and dudes.</v>

466
00:19:57.270 --> 00:20:01.520
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Johnny Hendricks just took out </v>

467
00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.231
<v Speaker 2>finch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's his wrestler dudes that are </v>

468
00:20:03.231 --> 00:20:05.301
<v Speaker 2>just.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're striking is slowly getting </v>

469
00:20:05.301 --> 00:20:05.301
<v Speaker 2>better,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slowly getting better,</v>

470
00:20:05.301 --> 00:20:09.711
<v Speaker 2>but the power's always there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a matter of figuring out how </v>

471
00:20:09.711 --> 00:20:09.780
<v Speaker 2>to put face to face and they're getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>better at it.</v>

472
00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:10.860
<v Speaker 2>And Johnny Hendricks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

473
00:20:10.861 --> 00:20:13.140
<v Speaker 2>the way he put out John Fitch like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>with one punch,</v>

474
00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:18.620
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Johnny Hendricks hits anybody with that </v>

475
00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:19.500
<v Speaker 2>punch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anybody and your Foxville fucked.</v>

476
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:24.590
<v Speaker 2>That guy hits really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's some guys who watch them hit </v>

477
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:24.590
<v Speaker 2>dudes in the cage and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

478
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:25.170
<v Speaker 2>you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

479
00:20:25.171 --> 00:20:26.160
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a strong guy.</v>

480
00:20:26.161 --> 00:20:28.320
<v Speaker 2>That's an athletic guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hendrix is one of those guys.</v>

481
00:20:28.321 --> 00:20:30.930
<v Speaker 2>He's got that extra.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an extra.</v>

482
00:20:31.410 --> 00:20:33.810
<v Speaker 2>There's some dudes when they hit you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you hear it.</v>

483
00:20:33.811 --> 00:20:38.811
<v Speaker 2>When you hear them hit the bag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you're not ever knowing when </v>

484
00:20:38.811 --> 00:20:38.811
<v Speaker 2>you hit it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I hit the bag and they go,</v>

485
00:20:38.811 --> 00:20:40.500
<v Speaker 2>this motherfucker's got that extra pop </v>
<v Speaker 2>to it.</v>

486
00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:44.340
<v Speaker 2>That's what Hendrix has gotten you here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The have that or you don't have that.</v>

487
00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:49.460
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can certainly make your punching </v>

488
00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:51.021
<v Speaker 2>power better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You certainly build your muscles up a </v>

489
00:20:51.021 --> 00:20:53.311
<v Speaker 2>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>put some weight on learning how to turn </v>

490
00:20:53.311 --> 00:20:53.311
<v Speaker 2>your body into things better.</v>

491
00:20:53.311 --> 00:20:56.370
<v Speaker 2>But some dudes just know how to throw </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that Hendrix cat knows how to throw </v>

492
00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:56.370
<v Speaker 2>and sodas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pierce,</v>

493
00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:58.060
<v Speaker 2>he knows how to fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Especially that left hook.</v>

494
00:20:58.090 --> 00:21:03.090
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who he's got power and cost check to </v>

495
00:21:03.090 --> 00:21:03.280
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Caustic is dangerous as fuck man.</v>

496
00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:04.410
<v Speaker 2>That man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was fight.</v>

497
00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:06.520
<v Speaker 2>That was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a brutal assassination man.</v>

498
00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:07.450
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was a,</v>

499
00:21:07.451 --> 00:21:12.451
<v Speaker 2>it was a brutal ending to that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which you kind of knew what was gonna </v>

500
00:21:12.451 --> 00:21:12.451
<v Speaker 2>happen stylistically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You like,</v>

501
00:21:12.451 --> 00:21:16.531
<v Speaker 2>well here's two really good wrestlers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one of them had stupid knockout </v>

502
00:21:16.531 --> 00:21:17.980
<v Speaker 2>power and the other one you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has been knocked out a few times.</v>

503
00:21:17.981 --> 00:21:22.981
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not the best stylistic matchup for </v>

504
00:21:22.981 --> 00:21:22.981
<v Speaker 2>Hughes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

505
00:21:22.981 --> 00:21:23.980
<v Speaker 2>now he's going to fight again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who's looking for another fight?</v>

506
00:21:23.981 --> 00:21:26.650
<v Speaker 2>Hughes man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's an hoists gracie.</v>

507
00:21:26.651 --> 00:21:27.790
<v Speaker 2>They should make that happen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

508
00:21:28.390 --> 00:21:30.060
<v Speaker 2>He'll kill hoists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't matter.</v>

509
00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:31.210
<v Speaker 2>It's good rematch.</v>

510
00:21:31.210 --> 00:21:33.580
<v Speaker 2>Hoy's wants it really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No matter what happens.</v>

511
00:21:33.810 --> 00:21:36.460
<v Speaker 2>If I shouldn't be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I shouldn't say always because you never</v>

512
00:21:36.461 --> 00:21:41.461
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What the fuck is gonna happen and who's </v>

513
00:21:41.461 --> 00:21:41.461
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's a legend,</v>

514
00:21:41.461 --> 00:21:41.461
<v Speaker 2>but based on that first fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would hate to see that again,</v>

515
00:21:41.461 --> 00:21:45.540
<v Speaker 2>unless there was something wrong with it</v>
<v Speaker 2>is he's claiming he was sick or </v>

516
00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:45.540
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know who he.</v>

517
00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:49.060
<v Speaker 2>His voice is an all time great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's the original legend.</v>

518
00:21:49.061 --> 00:21:51.880
<v Speaker 2>He was the first Jujitsu Guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first guy to show the world.</v>

519
00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.160
<v Speaker 2>If it wasn't for him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would have never known.</v>

520
00:21:54.370 --> 00:21:59.370
<v Speaker 2>None of us would have ever known if it </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't for his accomplishments in the </v>

521
00:21:59.370 --> 00:21:59.370
<v Speaker 2>ultimate fighting championship.</v>
<v Speaker 2>None of us would have ever known,</v>

522
00:21:59.530 --> 00:22:01.930
<v Speaker 2>but that was a long fucking time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

523
00:22:01.931 --> 00:22:06.931
<v Speaker 2>and errors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They pass for reason and at a certain </v>

524
00:22:06.931 --> 00:22:09.841
<v Speaker 2>point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your body just has not moved the same </v>

525
00:22:09.841 --> 00:22:09.841
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>

526
00:22:09.841 --> 00:22:12.900
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the world passes you by and when </v>

527
00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:12.900
<v Speaker 2>that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to step aside,</v>

528
00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:12.900
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to step aside.</v>

529
00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.730
<v Speaker 2>You can't just be going out there and </v>
<v Speaker 2>getting knocked out all the time and get</v>

530
00:22:15.731 --> 00:22:18.670
<v Speaker 2>hurt all the time because it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just reality.</v>

531
00:22:18.790 --> 00:22:19.570
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>

532
00:22:19.571 --> 00:22:24.571
<v Speaker 2>There's a certain point in time where </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of us are going to be dust band and </v>

533
00:22:24.571 --> 00:22:27.541
<v Speaker 2>the only way this sport really works is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we stop people from competing when </v>

534
00:22:27.791 --> 00:22:30.010
<v Speaker 2>they hit that point because they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe it.</v>

535
00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.680
<v Speaker 2>The same thing that makes someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a great fighter make someone say,</v>

536
00:22:32.681 --> 00:22:33.610
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're all wrong.</v>

537
00:22:33.611 --> 00:22:38.611
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to prove the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to go out and one more time </v>

538
00:22:38.611 --> 00:22:38.611
<v Speaker 2>I'm making a comeback that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that's,</v>

539
00:22:38.611 --> 00:22:40.270
<v Speaker 2>that's how guys get fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they got to decide for themselves.</v>

540
00:22:40.271 --> 00:22:41.630
<v Speaker 2>A voice wants to fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to.</v>

541
00:22:41.650 --> 00:22:44.500
<v Speaker 2>I would love to see Hoist Matt Hughes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants it.</v>

542
00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:46.420
<v Speaker 2>If Matt huge wants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wants another fight.</v>

543
00:22:46.421 --> 00:22:48.670
<v Speaker 2>That's a great remark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if you got them mad?</v>

544
00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.620
<v Speaker 2>What if he was good on his back?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like before.</v>

545
00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:55.690
<v Speaker 2>That'd be bombing them in the head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dean would come in and stop it at the </v>

546
00:22:55.690 --> 00:22:55.840
<v Speaker 2>perfect time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

547
00:22:55.841 --> 00:22:58.330
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to watch that fight again.</v>

548
00:22:58.331 --> 00:23:00.910
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to watch what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love voice too much,</v>

549
00:23:00.911 --> 00:23:01.960
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love that guy.</v>

550
00:23:01.961 --> 00:23:03.790
<v Speaker 2>I think he's like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a legend.</v>

551
00:23:03.791 --> 00:23:05.380
<v Speaker 2>He said he's not going to get killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll tap.</v>

552
00:23:06.140 --> 00:23:11.140
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to see him fighting that in the </v>

553
00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:14.320
<v Speaker 2>end.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unless there was something really wrong </v>

554
00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:14.320
<v Speaker 2>with them and unless he's different now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I.</v>

555
00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:15.160
<v Speaker 2>You want it really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's good enough.</v>

556
00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:17.080
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who else wants Hughes?</v>

557
00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:18.550
<v Speaker 2>Who Your boy?</v>

558
00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:21.160
<v Speaker 2>Mike Hardy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Shit.</v>

559
00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:26.190
<v Speaker 2>Damn hard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been calling them out and hard to </v>

560
00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:26.190
<v Speaker 2>do a good fight to him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apparently.</v>

561
00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:26.190
<v Speaker 2>That'd be a good fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

562
00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:29.230
<v Speaker 2>You don't think it'd be able to take Dan</v>
<v Speaker 2>hardee down fairly easily.</v>

563
00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.420
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dan's worked really hard on his rest.</v>

564
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:37.950
<v Speaker 2>I'm assuming he's working like day and </v>
<v Speaker 2>night on takedown defense and diffuse </v>

565
00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:41.800
<v Speaker 2>goes back to the way he was wrestling </v>
<v Speaker 2>when he was at his peak.</v>

566
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:42.790
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if that's possible,</v>

567
00:23:42.791 --> 00:23:44.440
<v Speaker 2>if his body can still do that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

568
00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:47.970
<v Speaker 2>remember those days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the saccharide days when you,</v>

569
00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:52.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people forget how dominant that </v>

570
00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:52.980
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

571
00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:52.980
<v Speaker 2>he was dominant man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was like,</v>

572
00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:56.180
<v Speaker 2>one of the first dominant wrestler is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually that learned submissions too,</v>

573
00:23:56.450 --> 00:23:59.810
<v Speaker 2>so he wouldn't just beat you up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He started strangling guys taken back.</v>

574
00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.340
<v Speaker 2>He started getting armbars frank trigg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck Ya.</v>

575
00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.870
<v Speaker 2>Beat him twice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Twice with a rear naked choke the second</v>

576
00:24:05.871 --> 00:24:07.280
<v Speaker 2>time after he got kicked in the balls.</v>

577
00:24:07.690 --> 00:24:09.010
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those were great memories.</v>

<v Speaker 2>after.</v>

579
00:24:11.271 --> 00:24:13.370
<v Speaker 2>After Frank trigg was bombing on them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Frank Trigg,</v>

580
00:24:13.371 --> 00:24:18.371
<v Speaker 2>God is back and it looked bad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but frank trigg does not know how to </v>

<v Speaker 2>finish that joke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his know how to defend or finish and </v>

<v Speaker 2>walked into the middle of the fucking </v>

583
00:24:24.821 --> 00:24:24.821
<v Speaker 2>cage and threw him against the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was awesome,</v>

584
00:24:24.821 --> 00:24:25.610
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was awesome.</v>

585
00:24:25.611 --> 00:24:29.660
<v Speaker 2>That was like one of the best moments </v>
<v Speaker 2>like mma moments come from behind,</v>

586
00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:31.490
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from being stuck,</v>

587
00:24:31.670 --> 00:24:34.250
<v Speaker 2>got kicks you in the balls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit you with a bunch of shots,</v>

588
00:24:34.370 --> 00:24:39.370
<v Speaker 2>takes your back and this is that in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>rematch of a fight where you fucked him </v>

589
00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:40.670
<v Speaker 2>up in the first fight and he didn't want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to fight him in the second fight anyway,</v>

590
00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:44.900
<v Speaker 2>and then he starts winning and then he </v>
<v Speaker 2>was just mustered all up and turn it all</v>

591
00:24:44.901 --> 00:24:45.260
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

592
00:24:45.410 --> 00:24:47.960
<v Speaker 2>That was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was some amazing shit.</v>

593
00:24:48.130 --> 00:24:53.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some good high guard action in that </v>

594
00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:53.130
<v Speaker 2>fight as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seeing that a guy like he was.</v>

595
00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:55.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think he uses a great fighter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I think a certain,</v>

596
00:24:55.640 --> 00:25:00.640
<v Speaker 2>a certain number of knockouts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the they have to step in and stop you </v>

597
00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.550
<v Speaker 2>from doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Whether it's your family,</v>

598
00:25:01.551 --> 00:25:03.020
<v Speaker 2>whether it's your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's,</v>

599
00:25:03.021 --> 00:25:04.040
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your boss,</v>

600
00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.940
<v Speaker 2>there's a certain amount of times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

601
00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:07.450
<v Speaker 2>I've talked to a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

602
00:25:07.451 --> 00:25:12.451
<v Speaker 2>a guy that I know very well who is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>brain is a traumatic brain injury </v>

603
00:25:12.951 --> 00:25:17.420
<v Speaker 2>specialist and what he deals with is </v>
<v Speaker 2>rehabilitating people and um,</v>

604
00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:22.840
<v Speaker 2>and helping people like with all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>mental imbalances that people have due </v>

605
00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:27.701
<v Speaker 2>to traumatic brain injuries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the things that happens is your </v>

606
00:25:27.701 --> 00:25:28.610
<v Speaker 2>body stops producing testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get really lethargic,</v>

607
00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:33.760
<v Speaker 2>you get depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like that happens to a lot of guys that </v>

608
00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:33.760
<v Speaker 2>have a bunch of head injuries.</v>

609
00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:37.660
<v Speaker 2>They get depressed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The apparently your brain can only take </v>

610
00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:39.530
<v Speaker 2>like a few concussions in your life who </v>
<v Speaker 2>needs to retire right now,</v>

611
00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:44.650
<v Speaker 2>who,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would never tell any of them to </v>

612
00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:44.660
<v Speaker 2>retire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there's a few dudes that I would,</v>

613
00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:47.000
<v Speaker 2>I would pull aside and I would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

614
00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:48.800
<v Speaker 2>think about this a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

615
00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:51.110
<v Speaker 2>who I don't want to say because I'm in </v>
<v Speaker 2>my position,</v>

616
00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:52.310
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>being a commentator.</v>

617
00:25:52.730 --> 00:25:53.630
<v Speaker 2>But there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of,</v>

618
00:25:53.631 --> 00:25:53.990
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any,</v>

619
00:25:53.991 --> 00:25:55.910
<v Speaker 2>any dudes who have been knocked out a </v>
<v Speaker 2>gang of times,</v>

620
00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:58.550
<v Speaker 2>but there's guys that violate that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like Alistair Overeem,</v>

621
00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:01.040
<v Speaker 2>Alistair overeem been stopped a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>

622
00:26:01.041 --> 00:26:03.350
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been knocked out a gang of times.</v>

623
00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:04.970
<v Speaker 2>How many times?</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot.</v>

624
00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:08.180
<v Speaker 2>I would bet he's been stopped at least </v>
<v Speaker 2>eight times.</v>

625
00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:09.530
<v Speaker 2>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

626
00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:11.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's been.</v>

627

<v Speaker 2>Chuck knocked him out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

629
00:26:15.231 --> 00:26:15.710
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

630
00:26:15.711 --> 00:26:16.820
<v Speaker 2>in kickboxing.</v>

631
00:26:17.150 --> 00:26:22.150
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does that big dude that used to </v>

632
00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:22.150
<v Speaker 2>fight king of the cage?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Real angry guy.</v>

633
00:26:22.580 --> 00:26:23.660
<v Speaker 2>Hoffman.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bob Hoffman.</v>

634
00:26:23.661 --> 00:26:26.250
<v Speaker 2>Bob Hoffman knocked them out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How about Bobby Hoffman?</v>

635
00:26:26.251 --> 00:26:29.330
<v Speaker 2>K Odem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Shogun Kod.</v>

636
00:26:29.331 --> 00:26:32.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I believe I'm a bunch of dudes.</v>

637
00:26:32.511 --> 00:26:33.830
<v Speaker 2>Stopped him at a bar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

638

<v Speaker 2>Keratan off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Knocked him out.</v>

639
00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:39.770
<v Speaker 2>A bunch of dudes stopped overeem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But overeem figured it out,</v>

640
00:26:39.771 --> 00:26:41.360
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And one of the things he figured out,</v>

641
00:26:41.361 --> 00:26:44.010
<v Speaker 2>he was just too fucking small.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was too small at two.</v>

642
00:26:44.011 --> 00:26:44.910
<v Speaker 2>Oh five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

643
00:26:45.210 --> 00:26:47.130
<v Speaker 2>when he moved up to heavyweight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But then again,</v>

644
00:26:47.131 --> 00:26:49.470
<v Speaker 2>Keratan a pink Keratan of Jack intimate </v>
<v Speaker 2>heavyweight.</v>

645
00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:50.520
<v Speaker 2>He started,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

646
00:26:50.521 --> 00:26:52.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what changed in him?</v>

647
00:26:52.351 --> 00:26:54.690
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what changed his ultimate dedication?</v>

648
00:26:54.691 --> 00:26:57.580
<v Speaker 2>What changed in his intensity?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would change,</v>

649
00:26:57.581 --> 00:26:59.910
<v Speaker 2>but no one's ever turned it around like </v>
<v Speaker 2>overeem.</v>

650
00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:04.110
<v Speaker 2>No one's ever gone from being stopped </v>
<v Speaker 2>like eight times and you know,</v>

651
00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:05.520
<v Speaker 2>back when he was fighting at two.</v>

652
00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:06.750
<v Speaker 2>Oh five.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you know,</v>

653
00:27:06.751 --> 00:27:08.610
<v Speaker 2>in mma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was thought of is,</v>

654
00:27:08.611 --> 00:27:09.930
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tough guy,</v>

655
00:27:09.931 --> 00:27:11.670
<v Speaker 2>a tough guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a guy who would gas out,</v>

656
00:27:11.910 --> 00:27:16.910
<v Speaker 2>he goes from that to be the first guy to</v>
<v Speaker 2>win a world title in both MMA andK ,</v>

657
00:27:18.730 --> 00:27:20.880
<v Speaker 2>one kickboxing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one's ever done that before.</v>

658
00:27:20.970 --> 00:27:25.970
<v Speaker 2>No one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone that k one Grand Prix and one </v>

659
00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:27.630
<v Speaker 2>in mma title and looks like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know who the fuck looks like?</v>

660
00:27:27.631 --> 00:27:30.510
<v Speaker 2>Alistair overeem means the Goddamn </v>
<v Speaker 2>Superhero in a comic book.</v>

661
00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:33.480
<v Speaker 2>He turned it around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when you got a guy like that,</v>

662
00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:35.100
<v Speaker 2>you kind of can't say anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

663
00:27:35.101 --> 00:27:36.870
<v Speaker 2>you look at Mirko Cro cop and you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

664
00:27:36.871 --> 00:27:38.730
<v Speaker 2>I love Cro cop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a legend.</v>

665
00:27:38.731 --> 00:27:40.890
<v Speaker 2>He's got one of the greatest highlight </v>
<v Speaker 2>reels of all time.</v>

666
00:27:40.891 --> 00:27:43.560
<v Speaker 2>Those head kick knockouts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one after the other,</v>

667
00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:48.620
<v Speaker 2>but at a certain point in time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how many times can cro cop get knocked </v>

668
00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:48.620
<v Speaker 2>out before someone doesn't want to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

669
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:50.070
<v Speaker 2>you feel bad for them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

670
00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:55.090
<v Speaker 2>you know what's amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the alertness of the whole concussion </v>

671
00:27:55.090 --> 00:27:55.320
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like everybody's hip to it now.</v>

672
00:27:55.320 --> 00:28:00.320
<v Speaker 2>Like I was watching 60 minutes Tuesday </v>
<v Speaker 2>night and they interviewed Roger </v>

673
00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:00.320
<v Speaker 2>Goodell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

674
00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:04.530
<v Speaker 2>the whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the NFL and a Monday he reviews tapes to</v>

675
00:28:04.531 --> 00:28:09.180
<v Speaker 2>see who gets concussions and they showed</v>
<v Speaker 2>a guy hitting another guy,</v>

676
00:28:09.181 --> 00:28:14.181
<v Speaker 2>like a wide receiver getting hit by a </v>
<v Speaker 2>defensive back and he pointed to the </v>

677
00:28:14.181 --> 00:28:17.070
<v Speaker 2>defensive back getting the concussion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It stayed in the fucking game.</v>

678
00:28:17.340 --> 00:28:22.340
<v Speaker 2>So they're finding them know if they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They stay in the fucking game with a </v>

679
00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:24.120
<v Speaker 2>concussion because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to go to fuck out.</v>

680
00:28:24.121 --> 00:28:25.740
<v Speaker 2>You're rocking your plane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

681
00:28:25.741 --> 00:28:30.741
<v Speaker 2>So you don't even feel it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's amazing how the guys are </v>

682
00:28:30.741 --> 00:28:33.710
<v Speaker 2>standing voluntarily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So who the fuck are you to tell a </v>

683
00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:38.060
<v Speaker 2>dangerous man?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really dangerous in the football </v>

684
00:28:38.060 --> 00:28:40.671
<v Speaker 2>players.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're finding out now you know these </v>

685
00:28:40.671 --> 00:28:40.671
<v Speaker 2>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the time they even get to college,</v>

686
00:28:40.671 --> 00:28:41.100
<v Speaker 2>a lot of them are fucked up.</v>

687
00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.900
<v Speaker 2>That dude who remember that dude who </v>
<v Speaker 2>died,</v>

688
00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:48.140
<v Speaker 2>henry something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Henry died in a back of a pickup truck </v>

689
00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:51.780
<v Speaker 2>filled football player really recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you don't know what I'm talking </v>

690

<v Speaker 2>about?</v>

717
00:30:03.691 --> 00:30:03.691
<v Speaker 2>had no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they would just throw in these people</v>

718
00:30:03.691 --> 00:30:04.840
<v Speaker 2>back in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over and over and over again.</v>

00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:16.280
<v Speaker 2>weekend and the amateur show and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't knocked out completely.</v>

724
00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:21.410
<v Speaker 2>It was controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost like the rest stop that it could </v>

725
00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:21.410
<v Speaker 2>have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was on the fence,</v>

726
00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:25.791
<v Speaker 2>whether it was early or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He got up right away and was </v>

727
00:30:25.791 --> 00:30:25.830
<v Speaker 2>complaining.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was never out,</v>

728
00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:28.590
<v Speaker 2>but he was like a little rock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't complain about the stoppage.</v>

729
00:30:28.591 --> 00:30:29.790
<v Speaker 2>It looked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looked legit.</v>

730
00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:34.880
<v Speaker 2>He got rock standing and then got taken </v>
<v Speaker 2>down a couple of ground and pound </v>

731
00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:34.890
<v Speaker 2>against the cage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He never was out,</v>

732
00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:37.650
<v Speaker 2>popped up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the time we got backstage,</v>

733
00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:42.980
<v Speaker 2>by the end he sat down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't remember anything about the </v>

734
00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:42.980
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not One.</v>

735
00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:45.600
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember anything about the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't even out though.</v>

736
00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:50.630
<v Speaker 2>That's the crazy thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't even out and he doesn't </v>

737
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.630
<v Speaker 2>remember.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He didn't remember the name of the hotel</v>

738
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.630
<v Speaker 2>we were in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

739
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:53.700
<v Speaker 2>you remember when we saw Tim Sylvia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we were in the hotel bar.</v>

740
00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:57.060
<v Speaker 2>We're waiting to get our car to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>airport and it was the next day after he</v>

741
00:30:57.061 --> 00:31:02.061
<v Speaker 2>fought randy coture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he fought five rounds against randy and </v>

742
00:31:02.061 --> 00:31:02.370
<v Speaker 2>lost his title and he came up to us and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he goes,</v>

743
00:31:02.371 --> 00:31:02.760
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He goes,</v>

744
00:31:02.761 --> 00:31:04.710
<v Speaker 2>I don't even remember the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he goes,</v>

745
00:31:04.711 --> 00:31:05.240
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

747
00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:11.680
<v Speaker 2>the bell ringing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then I remember sitting in the </v>

748
00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:11.680
<v Speaker 2>corner asking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:12.960
<v Speaker 2>my corner,</v>

750
00:31:12.961 --> 00:31:15.000
<v Speaker 2>and now it's the last round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's like,</v>

751
00:31:15.001 --> 00:31:20.001
<v Speaker 2>what the last round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you just fought five rounds on </v>

752
00:31:20.001 --> 00:31:20.460
<v Speaker 2>instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had no idea what happened.</v>

753
00:31:20.550 --> 00:31:25.550
<v Speaker 2>He got hit with one righthand early in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fight and just had no idea what </v>

754
00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:25.550
<v Speaker 2>happened.</v>

755
00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:25.550
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

756
00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:27.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's what you don't.</v>

757
00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:28.570
<v Speaker 2>We don't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what,</v>

758
00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:32.720
<v Speaker 2>that's why it drives me crazy when </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone would call a fighter a pussy.</v>

759
00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:33.580
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this guy,</v>

760
00:31:33.581 --> 00:31:35.270
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he never brings you the fights.</v>

761
00:31:35.271 --> 00:31:37.080
<v Speaker 2>Like a wet blanket.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You go get your,</v>

762
00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:39.290
<v Speaker 2>you get your fucking brains rearrange </v>

<v Speaker 2>the side of the head.</v>

764
00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:47.080
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of guys like criticized </v>

765
00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:47.080
<v Speaker 2>guides for being boring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

766
00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:47.400
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't bother me at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

767
00:31:47.470 --> 00:31:49.850
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe I don't necessarily want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>see them,</v>

768
00:31:49.851 --> 00:31:53.400
<v Speaker 2>but I respect what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I respect like,</v>

769
00:31:53.510 --> 00:31:55.970
<v Speaker 2>like Antonio Mckey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of guys give him a lot of shit,</v>

770
00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:57.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because he,</v>

771
00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:59.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he kinda like wrestled to the ground.</v>

772
00:31:59.481 --> 00:32:04.481
<v Speaker 2>He never never gets into standup </v>
<v Speaker 2>exchanges with guys too much and it </v>

773
00:32:04.481 --> 00:32:04.481
<v Speaker 2>doesn't take any damage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's the key.</v>

774
00:32:04.481 --> 00:32:05.750
<v Speaker 2>He doesn't take any damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

775
00:32:05.751 --> 00:32:07.160
<v Speaker 2>Might not be the most exciting thing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>

776
00:32:07.161 --> 00:32:08.840
<v Speaker 2>but if you want to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's really.</v>

777
00:32:08.841 --> 00:32:10.370
<v Speaker 2>That's a smart way to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

778
00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:13.190
<v Speaker 2>Smartly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you just closed a closed shop,</v>

779
00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:13.880
<v Speaker 2>clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything,</v>

780
00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:16.190
<v Speaker 2>there'll be no punching that we know </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

781
00:32:16.191 --> 00:32:21.191
<v Speaker 2>There'll be you on your back and be </v>
<v Speaker 2>punching you a little bit here and </v>

782
00:32:21.191 --> 00:32:23.561
<v Speaker 2>again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nothing crazy because I don't want </v>

783
00:32:23.561 --> 00:32:23.561
<v Speaker 2>to get submitted and then I'll win every</v>
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>

784
00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:24.560
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

785
00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:26.980
<v Speaker 2>it's not the smartest way to do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because it's a,</v>

786
00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.570
<v Speaker 2>it's a sport and you're also marketing </v>
<v Speaker 2>yourself.</v>

787
00:32:29.571 --> 00:32:31.400
<v Speaker 2>It's entertainment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I understand that.</v>

788
00:32:31.401 --> 00:32:32.740
<v Speaker 2>I'll never call one of those guys are </v>
<v Speaker 2>pushing.</v>

789
00:32:32.750 --> 00:32:33.920
<v Speaker 2>It's a smart way to fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

790
00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:37.190
<v Speaker 2>What'd you think of these fighters?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Last weekend was tough match ups,</v>

<v Speaker 2>you could tell when he was in there,</v>

795
00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:45.620
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he struggled.</v>

796
00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:48.260
<v Speaker 2>And even Ray Longo gave it away in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>corner.</v>

797
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:49.650
<v Speaker 2>Ray Longo said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

798
00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:52.220
<v Speaker 2>I saw what you went through yesterday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw what you did yesterday,</v>

799
00:32:52.221 --> 00:32:53.870

<v Speaker 2>They said that his,</v>

800
00:32:53.871 --> 00:32:56.400
<v Speaker 2>his cut was horrific,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he,</v>

<v Speaker 2>He just did it.</v>

802
00:32:59.211 --> 00:33:01.940
<v Speaker 2>And he went out there and he grinded on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Maya and he wanted a decision.</v>

803
00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:05.060
<v Speaker 2>But you could tell by the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first round he was dead.</v>

804
00:33:05.061 --> 00:33:06.920
<v Speaker 2>He was dead walking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And My,</v>

807
00:33:15.160 --> 00:33:16.130
<v Speaker 2>like earlier in the week.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did not look good either.</v>

808
00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:17.690
<v Speaker 2>So both guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a,</v>

809
00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:19.760
<v Speaker 2>it was a real endurance issue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

810
00:33:19.790 --> 00:33:22.790
<v Speaker 2>like I was talking to Jeremy Piven at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany and was like laughing about it,</v>

811
00:33:23.050 --> 00:33:24.680
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I didn't interview them and he's</v>

812
00:33:24.681 --> 00:33:26.240
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>would you have said to them?</v>

813
00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:31.360
<v Speaker 2>So it's safe to say endurance was an </v>
<v Speaker 2>issue in this fight because it really </v>

814
00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:32.240
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was kind of,</v>

815
00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:37.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't the best fight to showcase </v>

816
00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:37.330
<v Speaker 2>mma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

817
00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:41.980
<v Speaker 2>but it was just a circumstantial </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation is nothing you could do about </v>

818
00:33:41.980 --> 00:33:44.711
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got one guy was a fucking stud </v>

819
00:33:44.711 --> 00:33:46.691
<v Speaker 2>wrestler with all this God potential </v>
<v Speaker 2>that Chris Weidman could be the king of </v>

820
00:33:46.691 --> 00:33:49.811
<v Speaker 2>the world someday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He could be the John Jones of 185 </v>

821
00:33:49.811 --> 00:33:49.811
<v Speaker 2>pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a,</v>

822
00:33:49.811 --> 00:33:50.510
<v Speaker 2>he's a beast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a wicked wrestler.</v>

823
00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:55.600
<v Speaker 2>He puts guys to sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You put Tom Laurdis leap with that </v>

824
00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:55.670
<v Speaker 2>fucking darce choke.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's nasty man.</v>

825
00:33:55.671 --> 00:33:59.510
<v Speaker 2>He's strong as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw him fight Galvao in Abi Dhabi.</v>

826
00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:01.850
<v Speaker 2>He avoided everything and he got golf </v>
<v Speaker 2>vowel in a fucking.</v>

827
00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:04.730
<v Speaker 2>Doris didn't tap him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the fact that he was able to sink it</v>

828
00:34:04.731 --> 00:34:07.010
<v Speaker 2>in and lock it up and had galvao </v>
<v Speaker 2>fighting to,</v>

829
00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:07.700
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

830
00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:11.150
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to get his legs under him and to defend.</v>

831
00:34:11.570 --> 00:34:13.730
<v Speaker 2>Pretty fucking impressive for a dude as </v>
<v Speaker 2>a wrestler.</v>

832
00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:18.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what is Brazilian Jujitsu </v>

833
00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:18.840
<v Speaker 2>rank is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's one of those kids that,</v>

834
00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:20.480
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's really fucking strong willed,</v>

835
00:34:20.630 --> 00:34:22.430
<v Speaker 2>really smart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he's just a winner.</v>

836
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:24.080
<v Speaker 2>There's some dudes that are just </v>
<v Speaker 2>winters,</v>

837
00:34:24.081 --> 00:34:26.030
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could have a torn meniscus,</v>

838
00:34:26.031 --> 00:34:28.490
<v Speaker 2>they can have a fucking herniated disc.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They take you down anyway.</v>

839
00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:33.640
<v Speaker 2>They take you down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyone they still strangle you while </v>

840
00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:35.441
<v Speaker 2>they're in pain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's dudes that can just force force </v>

841
00:34:35.441 --> 00:34:35.480
<v Speaker 2>through shit like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's Weidman's one of those,</v>

842
00:34:35.481 --> 00:34:36.620
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's a fucking animal.</v>

843
00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:39.200
<v Speaker 2>And then Damien Maia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you don't want to think about my man.</v>

844
00:34:39.201 --> 00:34:44.201
<v Speaker 2>He's in limbo right now because my at </v>
<v Speaker 2>one point in time was just taken </v>

845
00:34:44.201 --> 00:34:47.641
<v Speaker 2>everybody down and strangled them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was all Jujitsu and that's when </v>

846
00:34:47.641 --> 00:34:47.641
<v Speaker 2>everybody loved him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was nasty,</v>

847
00:34:47.641 --> 00:34:49.760
<v Speaker 2>but somewhere along the line he figured,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>

848
00:34:49.930 --> 00:34:51.470
<v Speaker 2>these nate Marquardt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these guys,</v>

849
00:34:51.471 --> 00:34:52.460
<v Speaker 2>I can't take down.</v>

850
00:34:52.460 --> 00:34:55.280
<v Speaker 2>They beat the fuck out of me standing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got to get my stand up better.</v>

851
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:58.280
<v Speaker 2>But in doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his Jujitsu is just not the same.</v>

852
00:34:58.281 --> 00:34:59.840
<v Speaker 2>It's not what it used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

853
00:34:59.841 --> 00:35:02.750
<v Speaker 2>he submitted to jail sonnet and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>submitted at Herman.</v>

854
00:35:02.751 --> 00:35:05.060
<v Speaker 2>He submitted all these guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was strangling people,</v>

855
00:35:05.061 --> 00:35:06.530
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was nasty when,</v>

856
00:35:06.531 --> 00:35:11.531
<v Speaker 2>when he got you on the ground,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you were Foxville pulled guard on those </v>

857
00:35:11.531 --> 00:35:15.641
<v Speaker 2>guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He refuses to pull gardener Chael </v>

858
00:35:15.641 --> 00:35:15.641
<v Speaker 2>Sonnen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He hit it with a fucking lateral drop.</v>

859
00:35:15.641 --> 00:35:17.810
<v Speaker 2>You remember?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was nasty but.</v>

860
00:35:18.100 --> 00:35:21.560
<v Speaker 2>But his stand up is not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's a mechanical,</v>

861
00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:23.840
<v Speaker 2>like he moves like the whitest guy on </v>
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>

862
00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:29.020
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like if you look at the way he moves </v>

863
00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:31.301
<v Speaker 2>around,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's got like this and he does the same </v>

864
00:35:31.301 --> 00:35:31.301
<v Speaker 2>thing over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He paused with the right and then throws</v>

865
00:35:31.301 --> 00:35:32.570
<v Speaker 2>the left pause with the right and then </v>
<v Speaker 2>throws the left.</v>

866
00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:34.850
<v Speaker 2>It's way too predictable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

867
00:35:34.851 --> 00:35:36.550
<v Speaker 2>he needs to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That guy needs to.</v>

868
00:35:36.551 --> 00:35:37.950
<v Speaker 2>If he really wants to work on a stand </v>
<v Speaker 2>up,</v>

869
00:35:37.951 --> 00:35:42.420
<v Speaker 2>he needs to go to Holland and just hang </v>
<v Speaker 2>out with tyrone spong for a year.</v>

870
00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:45.360
<v Speaker 2>It just do what that guy does.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Move the way that guy does,</v>

871
00:35:45.361 --> 00:35:46.020
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go,</v>

872
00:35:46.021 --> 00:35:48.120
<v Speaker 2>go train will go con Saki,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go train with,</v>

873
00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.700
<v Speaker 2>go to Mike's gym and workout with Melvin</v>
<v Speaker 2>manhoef.</v>

874
00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.520
<v Speaker 2>See the way those guys move,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you gotTa,</v>

875
00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:54.000
<v Speaker 2>move like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imitate them,</v>

876
00:35:54.001 --> 00:35:56.760
<v Speaker 2>move the way they're moving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do those kinds of combinations.</v>

877
00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:59.640
<v Speaker 2>Maybe your body doesn't exactly move the</v>
<v Speaker 2>way that body moves,</v>

878
00:35:59.790 --> 00:36:04.790
<v Speaker 2>but try to emulate it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The best strikers all have a particular </v>

879
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:07.050
<v Speaker 2>style like specially kickboxers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They all have a particular style.</v>

880
00:36:07.051 --> 00:36:09.240
<v Speaker 2>You Watch men who fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he moves and he throws,</v>

881
00:36:09.241 --> 00:36:10.760
<v Speaker 2>Fain Tito's feint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>boom,</v>

882
00:36:10.761 --> 00:36:15.630
<v Speaker 2>and he throws kicks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's got a very particular way of moving</v>

883
00:36:15.631 --> 00:36:18.720
<v Speaker 2>and that the way of moving is the way of</v>
<v Speaker 2>an elite striker.</v>

884
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:22.160
<v Speaker 2>You know a dude like when you see it was</v>
<v Speaker 2>that dude's name Shale Sanderson.</v>

885
00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:23.320
<v Speaker 2>You ever see that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do a wrestle.</v>

886
00:36:23.770 --> 00:36:26.670
<v Speaker 2>That dude gets low and he moves on </v>
<v Speaker 2>dudes.</v>

887
00:36:26.730 --> 00:36:29.820
<v Speaker 2>There's guys that you look at them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you look at the move around on the mat,</v>

888
00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.440
<v Speaker 2>you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's a fucking killer.</v>

889
00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:33.540
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Mark Schultz back in the day,</v>

890
00:36:33.690 --> 00:36:36.810
<v Speaker 2>you would look at Mark Schultz,</v>
<v Speaker 2>move around like that is a killer.</v>

891
00:36:37.110 --> 00:36:41.130
<v Speaker 2>There's a certain way that guy moves you</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that's an elite wrestler,</v>

892
00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:43.050
<v Speaker 2>no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a way he hits those,</v>

893
00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.970
<v Speaker 2>hits those take downs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's elite.</v>

894
00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:50.230
<v Speaker 2>You gotta imitate those guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You gotta if you want to be a real </v>

895
00:36:50.230 --> 00:36:53.301
<v Speaker 2>striker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got to figure out what those guys </v>

896
00:36:53.301 --> 00:36:53.301
<v Speaker 2>are doing it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>figure out that style and then do it.</v>

897
00:36:53.301 --> 00:36:57.891
<v Speaker 2>Apply it to mma,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you've got to imitate the way they </v>

898
00:36:57.891 --> 00:37:00.321
<v Speaker 2>move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And right now Damien Maia does not move </v>

899
00:37:00.321 --> 00:37:01.160
<v Speaker 2>the way those elite strikers move,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

900
00:37:01.230 --> 00:37:02.580
<v Speaker 2>he's so good at Jujitsu.</v>

901
00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:04.470
<v Speaker 2>I know that he could be good at </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything else,</v>

902
00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:06.210
<v Speaker 2>but it's kind of a leap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

903
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:07.570
<v Speaker 2>at 32 years of age,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

904
00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:08.300
<v Speaker 2>it's tricky,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

905
00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:10.920
<v Speaker 2>How many is about 32?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not sure how old he is,</v>

906
00:37:11.580 --> 00:37:13.170
<v Speaker 2>but I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I really think that,</v>

907
00:37:13.530 --> 00:37:14.330
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

908
00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:18.870
<v Speaker 2>him eliminating the pulling guard </v>
<v Speaker 2>strategy as really hindered his game.</v>

909
00:37:18.871 --> 00:37:23.871
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's only three things you can do in </v>

910
00:37:23.871 --> 00:37:23.871
<v Speaker 2>a fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can fight standing where the dude,</v>

911
00:37:23.871 --> 00:37:26.790
<v Speaker 2>you can try to take the guy down or you </v>
<v Speaker 2>can pull guard.</v>

912
00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:32.120
<v Speaker 2>That's all you can do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Damien Maia always had that third </v>

913
00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:32.520
<v Speaker 2>option.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most MMA fighters,</v>

914
00:37:32.521 --> 00:37:35.850
<v Speaker 2>most of you seen fighters don't aren't </v>
<v Speaker 2>good at that third option,</v>

915
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:39.510
<v Speaker 2>their guard isn't dangerous enough to </v>
<v Speaker 2>pull and attack.</v>

916
00:37:39.511 --> 00:37:41.630
<v Speaker 2>Look at Paul Harris,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Paul Harris,</v>

917
00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:44.400
<v Speaker 2>that he who?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who is the guy beat.</v>

918
00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:46.710
<v Speaker 2>They put her in a leg lock.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh Mckenzie.</v>

919
00:37:46.711 --> 00:37:47.430
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

920
00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:49.200
<v Speaker 2>That guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm that guy.</v>

921
00:37:49.201 --> 00:37:51.780
<v Speaker 2>Could have been an Olympic wrestler and </v>
<v Speaker 2>a k,</v>

922
00:37:51.781 --> 00:37:53.430
<v Speaker 2>one champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Paul,</v>

923
00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:55.920
<v Speaker 2>it didn't matter to Paul Harvey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He took that out of the equation.</v>

924
00:37:55.980 --> 00:38:00.980
<v Speaker 2>He took us through a little shot and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>pulled guard and went right after his </v>

925
00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:02.070
<v Speaker 2>legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He bypassed the superior wrestling.</v>

926
00:38:02.071 --> 00:38:05.310
<v Speaker 2>He bypassed the superior striking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had the third option.</v>

927
00:38:05.311 --> 00:38:07.140
<v Speaker 2>Most fighters don't have that third </v>
<v Speaker 2>option.</v>

928
00:38:07.350 --> 00:38:10.980
<v Speaker 2>Damien Maia was one of the few that did </v>
<v Speaker 2>have the third option.</v>

929
00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:15.180
<v Speaker 2>If he was having trouble on his feet and</v>
<v Speaker 2>he couldn't take the guy down,</v>

930
00:38:15.181 --> 00:38:18.510
<v Speaker 2>which comes up all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having trouble on your feet.</v>

931
00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:21.810
<v Speaker 2>Can't take the dude down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you don't have that third option,</v>

932
00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:25.890
<v Speaker 2>you're going to just stand up and either</v>
<v Speaker 2>lose a decision or get knocked out.</v>

933
00:38:25.950 --> 00:38:26.670
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's,</v>

934
00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:29.130
<v Speaker 2>I would love to see Paul Harris and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Damien Maia.</v>

935
00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:32.390
<v Speaker 2>And remember at the height of Damien </v>
<v Speaker 2>Maia,</v>

936
00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.390
<v Speaker 2>he was pulling guard.</v>

937
00:38:33.510 --> 00:38:35.380
<v Speaker 2>He was taking shots.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he didn't take them down,</v>

938
00:38:35.381 --> 00:38:37.090
<v Speaker 2>he would pull garth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He would sweep them,</v>

939
00:38:37.091 --> 00:38:40.120
<v Speaker 2>get on top and attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not doing that no more.</v>

940
00:38:40.121 --> 00:38:41.040
<v Speaker 2>He decided,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some,</v>

941
00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:45.550
<v Speaker 2>someone convinced them that just be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>striker to stand up,</v>

942
00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:50.610
<v Speaker 2>try to take a guy down there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So many guys out there that he's not </v>

943
00:38:50.610 --> 00:38:53.521
<v Speaker 2>going to be able to take down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And there's so many guys that he's not </v>

944
00:38:53.521 --> 00:38:54.430
<v Speaker 2>going to be able to strike with Wa </v>
<v Speaker 2>Weidman.</v>

945
00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:56.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are you going to do now?</v>

946
00:38:56.330 --> 00:38:58.180
<v Speaker 2>And you know what he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

947
00:38:58.181 --> 00:39:03.181
<v Speaker 2>he was tired and sued for both guys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weren't in the best shape for that </v>

948
00:39:03.181 --> 00:39:06.541
<v Speaker 2>fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They both obviously had some sort of </v>

949
00:39:06.541 --> 00:39:06.541
<v Speaker 2>physical issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would it be didn't if Weidman was at his</v>

950
00:39:06.541 --> 00:39:07.300
<v Speaker 2>best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a terrible fight for him.</v>

951
00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:08.910
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not going to take the.</v>

952
00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:12.250
<v Speaker 2>But if he would have been the old damen </v>
<v Speaker 2>meier where he would have taken a shot,</v>

953
00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:12.940
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sprawled,</v>

954
00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:13.870
<v Speaker 2>he would've pulled guard.</v>

955
00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:19.020
<v Speaker 2>His guard is dangerous enough in </v>
<v Speaker 2>submissions and sweeps where he could </v>

956
00:39:19.020 --> 00:39:20.860
<v Speaker 2>have did something to Weidman,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he took that out of the equation and</v>

957
00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:25.060
<v Speaker 2>then he decided to kick box with them </v>
<v Speaker 2>and now all those years of Jujitsu,</v>

958
00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:28.390
<v Speaker 2>he's so good at Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not even in the game.</v>

959
00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.510
<v Speaker 2>It's a kickboxing match.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why would you do that?</v>

960
00:39:31.830 --> 00:39:33.700
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you can't take the guy down,</v>

961
00:39:34.330 --> 00:39:39.330
<v Speaker 2>the drag them down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Otherwise you have to kickbox and my is </v>

962
00:39:39.330 --> 00:39:42.160
<v Speaker 2>not a kickboxer so stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at Paul Harris,</v>

963
00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:43.810
<v Speaker 2>look at bars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What he did,</v>

964
00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:47.250
<v Speaker 2>he took a lazy shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy sprawled and sprawled right into</v>

965
00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:48.850
<v Speaker 2>guard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Went right to a leg lock.</v>

966
00:39:48.851 --> 00:39:51.760
<v Speaker 2>The fight was over in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those blocks are ridiculous,</v>

967
00:39:51.761 --> 00:39:53.230
<v Speaker 2>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His legs are ridiculous.</v>

968
00:39:53.231 --> 00:39:58.231
<v Speaker 2>His legs are ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was watching him move around and I </v>

969
00:39:58.231 --> 00:40:01.011
<v Speaker 2>was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this dude has like grapefruit stuffed </v>

970
00:40:01.011 --> 00:40:01.011
<v Speaker 2>into his cafs.</v>

971
00:40:01.011 --> 00:40:02.480
<v Speaker 2>Cafs really looked like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nobody's built like Paul.</v>

972
00:40:02.800 --> 00:40:07.800
<v Speaker 2>People should watch that fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pahara his last fight and look at that </v>

973
00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:11.290
<v Speaker 2>as a serious way out of a fight that </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're having trouble and if you're in a</v>

974
00:40:11.291 --> 00:40:13.870
<v Speaker 2>fight and you're beating them standing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck it.</v>

975
00:40:13.871 --> 00:40:15.830
<v Speaker 2>Stay standing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've got this motherfucker.</v>

976
00:40:15.850 --> 00:40:18.790
<v Speaker 2>Don't take them down.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you can take them down.</v>

977
00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:21.670
<v Speaker 2>If it's pretty easy to take him down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take him down,</v>

978
00:40:21.671 --> 00:40:26.671
<v Speaker 2>get on top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you can't strike with them and </v>

979
00:40:26.671 --> 00:40:27.250
<v Speaker 2>you can't take them down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which comes up and so many fights,</v>

980
00:40:27.251 --> 00:40:32.251
<v Speaker 2>it's so common.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You got to have your guard dangerous </v>

981
00:40:32.251 --> 00:40:34.370
<v Speaker 2>enough so that you can pull guard either</v>
<v Speaker 2>with leg locks.</v>

982
00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:40.060
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever liquid Baha'is look at early </v>

983
00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:40.060
<v Speaker 2>Maya.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

984
00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:40.390
<v Speaker 2>he's got to figure it out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but too bad.</v>

985
00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:42.490
<v Speaker 2>His Jujitsu is awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's awesome.</v>

986
00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:44.050
<v Speaker 2>The old days watched him is awesome.</v>

987
00:40:44.110 --> 00:40:45.370
<v Speaker 2>He's definitely got to figure it out </v>
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>

988
00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:46.780
<v Speaker 2>It's fucking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Game,</v>

989
00:40:46.781 --> 00:40:47.690
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fight game.</v>

990
00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:52.060
<v Speaker 2>It's a ridiculous game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ridiculous way to make a living,</v>

991
00:40:52.061 --> 00:40:54.820
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We want to talk about the craziest,</v>

992
00:40:54.821 --> 00:40:57.130
<v Speaker 2>most dangerous way outside of war to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make a living.</v>

993
00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:58.360
<v Speaker 2>That's it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

994
00:40:58.470 --> 00:41:00.750
<v Speaker 2>Imagine getting pushed into face </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyday training.</v>

995
00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:04.510
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can't fucking shit again for sure.</v>

996
00:41:05.170 --> 00:41:07.810
<v Speaker 2>Every fucking day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 fucking years.</v>

997
00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:08.840
<v Speaker 2>I remember when I first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

998
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:13.870
<v Speaker 2>the thing that really got me thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about what kind of damage a striking </v>

999
00:41:13.870 --> 00:41:18.421
<v Speaker 2>does to your head was when I started </v>
<v Speaker 2>transitioning from taekwondo to </v>

1000
00:41:18.421 --> 00:41:19.990
<v Speaker 2>kickboxing man because I was a novice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My striking was not very good.</v>

1001
00:41:19.991 --> 00:41:21.460
<v Speaker 2>My hands were not good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I could punch hard,</v>

1002
00:41:21.461 --> 00:41:26.461
<v Speaker 2>but I didn't really know how to box yet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I would go in there with guys who </v>

1003
00:41:26.461 --> 00:41:26.740
<v Speaker 2>didn't know how to box and even if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>weren't punching you hard,</v>

1004
00:41:26.741 --> 00:41:31.741
<v Speaker 2>they were hitting you a lot and you just</v>
<v Speaker 2>go home and you're fucking what would </v>

1005
00:41:31.741 --> 00:41:31.741
<v Speaker 2>lie in bed.</v>

1006
00:41:31.741 --> 00:41:33.590
<v Speaker 2>And my head would throb foam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>foam,</v>

1007
00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:36.020
<v Speaker 2>foam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>foam is that terrible female.</v>

1008
00:41:36.021 --> 00:41:38.580
<v Speaker 2>Like what am I doing in my brain?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

1009
00:41:38.600 --> 00:41:43.600
<v Speaker 2>this can't be good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lying in bed with headaches after a </v>

1010
00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:43.820
<v Speaker 2>sparring session.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That shit can't be good.</v>

1011
00:41:44.090 --> 00:41:45.000
<v Speaker 2>And he'd go everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

1012
00:41:45.010 --> 00:41:48.140
<v Speaker 2>the light would hurt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I wear sunglasses because he was.</v>

1013
00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:53.200
<v Speaker 2>The light would like hurt when your head</v>
<v Speaker 2>is pounding from getting punched in the </v>

1014
00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:53.540
<v Speaker 2>head.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shit is so bad for you.</v>

1015
00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:55.400
<v Speaker 2>That's why Jujitsu so beautiful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You get the,</v>

1016
00:41:55.490 --> 00:42:00.490
<v Speaker 2>you get the thrill of the kill,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yet there's no brain damage it except </v>

1017
00:42:00.490 --> 00:42:00.710
<v Speaker 2>you know the guy who scares everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most.</v>

1018
00:42:00.711 --> 00:42:03.470
<v Speaker 2>It's Paul Harris because everybody else </v>
<v Speaker 2>just kind of taps you out.</v>

1019
00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:07.100
<v Speaker 2>Paul Harvey's rips your legs apart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He rips through his legs apart.</v>

1020
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:09.640
<v Speaker 2>I mean he just gets a hold of your leg </v>
<v Speaker 2>and like,</v>

1021
00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:12.290
<v Speaker 2>sorry ain't walking right anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

1022
00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:13.970
<v Speaker 2>You be legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck for like a year.</v>

1023
00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:19.060
<v Speaker 2>Good luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might be the first guy to leg lock </v>

1024
00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:20.210
<v Speaker 2>his way to the top because if he just </v>
<v Speaker 2>keeps doing what he's doing,</v>

1025
00:42:20.570 --> 00:42:23.180
<v Speaker 2>what is he doing?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's not really striking too much with a</v>

1026
00:42:23.181 --> 00:42:25.990
<v Speaker 2>little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's just going to shoe and you're gonna</v>

1027
00:42:26.010 --> 00:42:27.950
<v Speaker 2>sprawl because the shot wasn't that </v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

1028
00:42:27.951 --> 00:42:32.951
<v Speaker 2>He's not a wrestler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then he's going to pull guard right </v>

1029
00:42:32.951 --> 00:42:35.051
<v Speaker 2>into your legs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what are you going to do against </v>

1030
00:42:35.051 --> 00:42:38.951
<v Speaker 2>that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can work on your takedown defense </v>

1031
00:42:38.951 --> 00:42:39.800
<v Speaker 2>all fucking day to your head explodes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's going to pull guard on you.</v>

1032
00:42:39.830 --> 00:42:44.830
<v Speaker 2>He's taken all your wrestling and just </v>
<v Speaker 2>throwing it out and fucking garbage all </v>

1033
00:42:44.830 --> 00:42:46.820
<v Speaker 2>you're striking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're wasting your motherfucking time.</v>

1034
00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:49.130
<v Speaker 2>He's just going to take a shot and pull </v>

<v Speaker 2>still fucking spending.</v>

1042

<v Speaker 2>Goddamn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had fun,</v>

1043
00:43:07.251 --> 00:43:08.690
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fucking stage,</v>

1044
00:43:08.691 --> 00:43:09.640
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was overwhelming.</v>

1045
00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:11.990
<v Speaker 2>That was one of the best shows we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever done,</v>

1046
00:43:11.991 --> 00:43:14.510
<v Speaker 2>I think is the best show we ever did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I walked on stage.</v>

1047
00:43:14.570 --> 00:43:19.570
<v Speaker 2>I had a study for step for a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the weed and the fucking stage hit </v>

1048
00:43:19.570 --> 00:43:21.860
<v Speaker 2>me all at one shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't digest my brain.</v>

1049
00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:24.770
<v Speaker 2>It was like I had a concussion for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first three minutes.</v>

1050
00:43:25.070 --> 00:43:30.070
<v Speaker 2>It was very surreal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then once I got my time and go and </v>

1051
00:43:30.070 --> 00:43:31.520
<v Speaker 2>it was all over,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was very surreal at first I could</v>

1052
00:43:31.521 --> 00:43:36.521
<v Speaker 2>absorb it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm used to doing the feeder with a </v>

1053
00:43:36.521 --> 00:43:38.111
<v Speaker 2>bottom of the top,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a bottom or top of the other top on </v>

1054
00:43:38.111 --> 00:43:39.320
<v Speaker 2>top of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another top on top of that filled to the</v>

1055
00:43:39.321 --> 00:43:42.260
<v Speaker 2>brim of the people fucking yelling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know who the fuck you are.</v>

00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:34.300
<v Speaker 4>I would open up the door and literally </v>
<v Speaker 4>say,</v>

1150
00:47:34.330 --> 00:47:36.040
<v Speaker 4>it wouldn't sound like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1151
00:47:36.110 --> 00:47:38.310
<v Speaker 4>like there was a hurricane going on in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the next week.</v>

1152
00:47:38.330 --> 00:47:39.730
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>was still sweating at night.</v>

1153
00:47:40.930 --> 00:47:45.930
<v Speaker 4>You got to go to a doctor,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I was still sweating to listen to </v>

1154
00:47:45.930 --> 00:47:49.500
<v Speaker 4>dog.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I walked into the doctor's office </v>

1155
00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:49.560
<v Speaker 4>yesterday for my preop.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I walked in there a quarter to nine.</v>

1156
00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:51.700
<v Speaker 4>I hadn't smoked reefer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't smoke reefer.</v>

1157
00:47:51.710 --> 00:47:53.350
<v Speaker 4>The night before I had 10 hours of </v>
<v Speaker 4>sleep,</v>

1158
00:47:53.620 --> 00:47:58.620
<v Speaker 4>drink water.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was relaxing on my blood pressure was </v>

1159
00:47:58.620 --> 00:47:59.450
<v Speaker 4>at a 45 in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 4>One 85 over 100.</v>

1160
00:47:59.940 --> 00:48:01.690

<v Speaker 4>that's horrible.</v>

1161
00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:05.140
<v Speaker 4>That's fucking murder.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then after they took the blood out,</v>

1162
00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:09.490
<v Speaker 4>it went down to like 1:40</v>
<v Speaker 4>over 90 and that's okay,</v>

1163
00:48:09.491 --> 00:48:11.530
<v Speaker 4>but it's still not acceptable.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1164
00:48:11.950 --> 00:48:15.010
<v Speaker 4>My engine runs hot all the time.</v>

1181
00:49:00.940 --> 00:49:03.260
<v Speaker 4>watchers to suck my fucking salad.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We always eat salad,</v>

00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:34.500
<v Speaker 4>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>How would we.</v>

1247
00:52:34.510 --> 00:52:39.510
<v Speaker 4>The hurt that it affected his lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We did all the smoking it to smoking it </v>

00:52:49.231 --> 00:52:50.870
<v Speaker 4>they do tests on the guy like Eddie </v>
<v Speaker 4>Bravo,</v>

1253
00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:55.700
<v Speaker 4>who's a normal weight yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you add 400 pounds,</v>

1254
00:52:55.701 --> 00:53:00.701
<v Speaker 4>it's got to do something to your fucking</v>
<v Speaker 4>lungs when your lungs are this big and </v>

1255
00:53:00.701 --> 00:53:01.010
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What's going on Brian?</v>

<v Speaker 4>affects you at every level.</v>

1258
00:53:07.640 --> 00:53:12.640
<v Speaker 4>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The reef is just something that they </v>

1259
00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:12.800
<v Speaker 4>told him to stop smoking as a </v>
<v Speaker 4>precautionary measure,</v>

1260
00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:17.030
<v Speaker 4>but I think the smoking anything is </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably not so fucking good.</v>

1261
00:53:17.090 --> 00:53:17.850
<v Speaker 4>Nobody,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 4>there's no evidence that it causes </v>
<v Speaker 4>cancer.</v>

1263
00:53:19.641 --> 00:53:24.641

<v Speaker 4>But there's other options.</v>

<v Speaker 4>The whole PD.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know for a fact that OCD,</v>

<v Speaker 4>you hear the little bells and whistles </v>

1282
00:54:07.430 --> 00:54:12.111
<v Speaker 4>and your lungs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you know when you right now you're </v>

1283

<v Speaker 4>ever going to be breathing on the have </v>
<v Speaker 4>you ever still below me breathing on the</v>

1284
00:54:18.721 --> 00:54:20.610
<v Speaker 4>microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're fucking stupid.</v>

1285

<v Speaker 4>You ever do a thing on the microphone?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You go join me here.</v>

1287
00:54:25.110 --> 00:54:27.660
<v Speaker 4>Do you hear any breathing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That cop did something.</v>

1288
00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:30.120
<v Speaker 4>So what I usually do is look at the fuck</v>
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

1289
00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:34.660
<v Speaker 4>Don't look at that look acronym.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

1290
00:54:35.330 --> 00:54:36.930
<v Speaker 4>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used to take the steroids that used to</v>

1291
00:54:36.931 --> 00:54:41.931
<v Speaker 4>breathe in and it gives you a fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>know that the one doctor said as my </v>

1292
00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:43.740
<v Speaker 4>asthma.</v>

1293
00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:48.760
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so what I used to do is whenever I hear </v>

1294
00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:48.760
<v Speaker 4>the bells and whistles,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just go run around three labs.</v>

1295
00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:50.910
<v Speaker 4>Both claims are that really have been </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing that for years.</v>

1296
00:54:50.911 --> 00:54:55.911
<v Speaker 4>Whenever I hear a bell and whistle that </v>
<v Speaker 4>museum walking enough cock suck and get </v>

1297
00:54:55.911 --> 00:54:59.061
<v Speaker 4>on the blow the whistle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you get that thing that Brian's got </v>

1298
00:54:59.061 --> 00:54:59.790
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's great.</v>

1299
00:54:59.791 --> 00:55:01.410
<v Speaker 4>That's great and shit,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you just got to get out and walk.</v>

1300
00:55:01.411 --> 00:55:03.010
<v Speaker 4>Forget computers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1301
00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:08.100
<v Speaker 4>But the beautiful thing about that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it tells you what you're telling </v>

1302
00:55:08.100 --> 00:55:09.030
<v Speaker 4>yourself.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It tells you how much you're doing</v>

1303
00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:12.820
<v Speaker 6>and if you think you need it and you're.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You don't have any money,</v>

1304
00:55:12.821 --> 00:55:14.620
<v Speaker 6>just write on a piece of paper.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're lazy.</v>

1305
00:55:14.621 --> 00:55:16.920
<v Speaker 6>Fucking put in your pocket.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And that's what I've realized that,</v>

1306
00:55:16.921 --> 00:55:18.790
<v Speaker 6>that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that what I do,</v>

1307
00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:20.410
<v Speaker 6>look at it and I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Oh shit,</v>

1308
00:55:20.411 --> 00:55:21.760
<v Speaker 6>I'm lazy.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know this already.</v>

1309
00:55:21.761 --> 00:55:24.220
<v Speaker 6>I could.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I could have saved myself $100.</v>

1310
00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:27.100
<v Speaker 6>And so you're not.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You're not changing your habits.</v>

1311
00:55:27.120 --> 00:55:31.360
<v Speaker 6>And I can see myself trying to beat my </v>
<v Speaker 6>score before I can kind of see that,</v>

1312
00:55:31.361 --> 00:55:36.361
<v Speaker 6>but unfortunately I just had this </v>
<v Speaker 6>lifestyle that I'm so fucking busy that </v>

1313
00:55:36.361 --> 00:55:40.410
<v Speaker 6>the only way that I can change that,</v>
<v Speaker 6>it's just to make sure I work out every </v>

1314
00:55:40.410 --> 00:55:41.230
<v Speaker 6>day where this is more like for people </v>
<v Speaker 6>that I guess,</v>

1315
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:42.940
<v Speaker 6>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like have time,</v>

1316
00:55:42.970 --> 00:55:47.970
<v Speaker 6>more time to try to jog more is totally </v>
<v Speaker 6>doing a totally different approach to </v>

1317
00:55:48.251 --> 00:55:53.251
<v Speaker 6>what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Brian is working out solely so that he </v>

1318
00:55:53.251 --> 00:55:53.251
<v Speaker 6>can get more pussy.</v>

1319
00:55:53.251 --> 00:55:54.590
<v Speaker 4>That's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's his issue.</v>

1320
00:55:54.950 --> 00:55:57.400
<v Speaker 4>That's why 60 percent of people take </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking steroids.</v>

1321
00:55:57.460 --> 00:55:58.780

<v Speaker 4>all the time on a regular basis.</v>

1460
01:01:57.180 --> 01:01:59.190
<v Speaker 4>Constant training,</v>
<v Speaker 4>constant fight,</v>

1461
01:01:59.191 --> 01:02:00.260
<v Speaker 4>constant tournament's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was,</v>

<v Speaker 4>that was my life from the time I was 15 </v>
<v Speaker 4>until I was 22.</v>

1463
01:02:03.511 --> 01:02:08.511
<v Speaker 4>All my formative years was all spent in </v>
<v Speaker 4>stress and I remember when I first </v>

1464
01:02:08.511 --> 01:02:09.540
<v Speaker 4>decided that I wasn't going to fight </v>
<v Speaker 4>anymore.</v>

1465
01:02:09.541 --> 01:02:11.880
<v Speaker 4>I was like the first time ever in my </v>
<v Speaker 4>life when I was like 22,</v>

1466
01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:13.680
<v Speaker 4>my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my last kickboxing fights.</v>

1467
01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:16.470
<v Speaker 4>I've the first time ever where I could </v>
<v Speaker 4>relax.</v>

1468
01:02:16.800 --> 01:02:18.090
<v Speaker 4>I would always be nervous.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

1469
01:02:18.091 --> 01:02:20.190
<v Speaker 4>when is the next?</v>
<v Speaker 4>When's the next fight?</v>

1470
01:02:20.191 --> 01:02:21.810
<v Speaker 4>When's the next thing I've got to get in</v>
<v Speaker 4>shape.</v>

1471
01:02:21.811 --> 01:02:23.450
<v Speaker 4>I can't be drinking this.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't be doing this.</v>

1472
01:02:23.730 --> 01:02:28.730
<v Speaker 4>Couldn't live my life because I was </v>
<v Speaker 4>always worrying about getting my ass </v>

1473
01:02:28.730 --> 01:02:28.730
<v Speaker 4>kicked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was always worrying about like,</v>

1474
01:02:28.730 --> 01:02:30.300
<v Speaker 4>I have to make sure that I do everything</v>
<v Speaker 4>right or to be prepared.</v>

1475
01:02:30.301 --> 01:02:31.830
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to get fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1476
01:02:31.831 --> 01:02:32.710
<v Speaker 4>So it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's,</v>

1477
01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:36.740
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't the best mindset to go into </v>
<v Speaker 4>stand up comedy for,</v>

1478
01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:41.760
<v Speaker 4>that's for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like a constant battle because </v>

1479
01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:41.760
<v Speaker 4>stand up comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got to totally the opposite.</v>

1480
01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:42.720
<v Speaker 4>You've got to not give a fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1481
01:02:42.721 --> 01:02:47.721
<v Speaker 4>you gotta you gotta be relaxed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You gotTa have fun instead of be tents </v>

1482
01:02:47.721 --> 01:02:48.120
<v Speaker 4>and ready to go at any moment's notice.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1483
01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:49.580
<v Speaker 6>you sent me a.</v>
<v Speaker 6>by the way,</v>

1484

<v Speaker 6>it doesn't work.</v>

1485
01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:52.400
<v Speaker 6>One of them doesn't work.</v>

01:04:37.510 --> 01:04:39.451
<v Speaker 4>thing really taught me about fear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My fear has fucking done wonders for me </v>

1530
01:04:39.970 --> 01:04:41.700
<v Speaker 4>because that's why when I wake up in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>Molesta,</v>

1531
01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:46.740
<v Speaker 4>first thing I fucking do is grab my </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking cock because for years I was </v>

1532
01:04:46.740 --> 01:04:51.691
<v Speaker 4>scared.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've always insecure that immigrant </v>

1533
01:04:51.691 --> 01:04:52.630
<v Speaker 4>fucking thing shizzle into my fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>mind.</v>

1534
01:04:52.830 --> 01:04:56.080
<v Speaker 4>Since the streets in New York City with </v>
<v Speaker 4>the immigrant thing,</v>

1535
01:04:56.081 --> 01:05:01.081
<v Speaker 4>not knowing the language,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not feeling good enough like everybody </v>

1536
01:05:01.081 --> 01:05:03.571
<v Speaker 4>else,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not beat a fucking American and it sits </v>

1537
01:05:03.571 --> 01:05:04.960
<v Speaker 4>inside my fucking soul.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So for me everything has been riveted on</v>

1538
01:05:04.961 --> 01:05:06.760
<v Speaker 4>fear.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every time I get on stage,</v>

1539
01:05:06.761 --> 01:05:09.610
<v Speaker 4>it's like the other night fear was real </v>
<v Speaker 4>in Chicago.</v>

1540
01:05:09.610 --> 01:05:13.330
<v Speaker 4>I got on stage in between the reefer and</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever was going on and the lights.</v>

1541
01:05:13.390 --> 01:05:15.400
<v Speaker 4>I got fearful man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you know what?</v>

1542
01:05:15.401 --> 01:05:18.130
<v Speaker 4>That's normal to be scared.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a great emotion,</v>

1543
01:05:18.131 --> 01:05:21.970
<v Speaker 4>especially when you're a stand up comic </v>
<v Speaker 4>because the more scared you are,</v>

1544
01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:24.850
<v Speaker 4>the better you're going to fucking do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Especially in my case,</v>

1545
01:05:24.851 --> 01:05:27.940
<v Speaker 4>the more riled up I am.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Two minutes before I go on stage,</v>

1546
01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:30.370
<v Speaker 4>the more energy I'm gonna give that </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking audience.</v>

1547
01:05:30.610 --> 01:05:35.610
<v Speaker 4>But I've looked at my life and I've seen</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much fear I was petrified to go get </v>

1548
01:05:35.610 --> 01:05:37.920
<v Speaker 4>that fucking needle even though I </v>
<v Speaker 4>fucking knew nothing was going to happen</v>

1549
01:05:37.921 --> 01:05:40.270
<v Speaker 4>and I was going to walk out of there,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I went in.</v>

1550
01:05:40.271 --> 01:05:42.060
<v Speaker 4>I took the needle after I walked out at </v>
<v Speaker 4>me like,</v>

1551
01:05:42.070 --> 01:05:47.070
<v Speaker 4>what a fucking killed 10 fucking people </v>
<v Speaker 4>with my bare hands because you overcome </v>

1552
01:05:47.070 --> 01:05:47.230
<v Speaker 4>one of your biggest fucking fears.</v>

1553
01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:49.840
<v Speaker 4>Till this day I get little emails and </v>

1556
01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:56.820
<v Speaker 4>I suffer from a social disorder and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>don't know what to do with the answer </v>

1557
01:05:56.820 --> 01:06:00.291

01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:57.800
<v Speaker 3>years and she,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1686
01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:59.590
<v Speaker 3>the whole point system that Jujitsu </v>

<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just people are fighting for</v>

1689
01:11:04.541 --> 01:11:07.330
<v Speaker 3>points and stalling and it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's ridiculous.</v>

1690
01:11:07.331 --> 01:11:09.820
<v Speaker 3>And Roads Gracie decided to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>a submission only tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And these,</v>

1693
01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:22.000
<v Speaker 3>these tournaments are becoming this </v>
<v Speaker 3>format.</v>

1694
01:11:22.001 --> 01:11:27.001
<v Speaker 3>It's becoming more and more popular.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They do it in the Pacific north </v>

1695
01:11:27.001 --> 01:11:27.001
<v Speaker 3>northwest at,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at,</v>

1696
01:11:27.001 --> 01:11:30.000
<v Speaker 3>at that sub league in Oregon and they </v>
<v Speaker 3>run smoothly.</v>

1697
01:11:30.001 --> 01:11:35.001
<v Speaker 3>People have been afraid of sub only </v>
<v Speaker 3>tournaments because of time constraints </v>

1698
01:11:35.731 --> 01:11:36.420
<v Speaker 3>and all that stuff.</v>

1699
01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:39.480
<v Speaker 3>But rose gracie made it work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>She had the balls to go,</v>

1700
01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:42.060
<v Speaker 3>no points,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no advantages,</v>

1701
01:11:42.150 --> 01:11:46.050
<v Speaker 3>15 minutes a submission only if,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if,</v>

1702
01:11:46.290 --> 01:11:48.990
<v Speaker 3>if you go 15 minutes without a </v>
<v Speaker 3>submission,</v>

1703
01:11:48.991 --> 01:11:51.750
<v Speaker 3>both competitors are out of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>tournament.</v>

1704
01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:55.170
<v Speaker 3>So that's the ballsy as format there is </v>
<v Speaker 3>out there.</v>

1705
01:11:55.470 --> 01:11:57.750
<v Speaker 3>And,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now the gracie nationals is the most</v>

1706
01:11:57.840 --> 01:12:01.260
<v Speaker 3>prestigious submission only tournament </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the planet.</v>

1707
01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:05.550
<v Speaker 3>And I think that's the future for </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu cause you know,</v>

1708
01:12:05.551 --> 01:12:08.880
<v Speaker 3>it was a lot more fun preparing for a </v>
<v Speaker 3>submission only tournament.</v>

1709
01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:14.400
<v Speaker 3>All we worked on was the fun stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The good stuff about Jujitsu that the </v>

1710
01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:18.321
<v Speaker 3>finish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the closing the deal that we're working </v>

1711
01:12:18.321 --> 01:12:19.550
<v Speaker 3>on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our squeeze for the Nogi Worlds.</v>

1712
01:12:20.320 --> 01:12:23.520
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had to spend time working on stalling</v>

1713
01:12:23.521 --> 01:12:28.521
<v Speaker 3>techniques because when you're playing a</v>
<v Speaker 3>point game and it's like six minute </v>

1714
01:12:28.521 --> 01:12:32.091
<v Speaker 3>matches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a guy will get a point or just a little </v>

1715
01:12:32.091 --> 01:12:32.250
<v Speaker 3>advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is even less than a point.</v>

1716
01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:37.280
<v Speaker 3>And once they're up an advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hold and they won't do anything and </v>

1717
01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:39.540
<v Speaker 3>people aren't used to wrestling with </v>
<v Speaker 3>guys that are just holding,</v>

1718
01:12:39.541 --> 01:12:42.750
<v Speaker 3>holding onto leads in class.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't just hold onto a lead,</v>

1719
01:12:42.751 --> 01:12:44.520
<v Speaker 3>there's no one's counting points in </v>
<v Speaker 3>class.</v>

1720
01:12:44.521 --> 01:12:49.521
<v Speaker 3>So you actually have to prepare for that</v>
<v Speaker 3>yet specifically prepare for tournaments</v>

1721
01:12:49.651 --> 01:12:53.820
<v Speaker 3>that are run by points and um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's just so not fun.</v>

1722
01:12:53.821 --> 01:12:58.680
<v Speaker 3>Preparing like stalling techniques and </v>
<v Speaker 3>stalling live drills and prepare.</v>

1723
01:12:58.681 --> 01:13:00.540
<v Speaker 3>What are the do just hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't do anything.</v>

1724
01:13:00.750 --> 01:13:05.750
<v Speaker 3>It's ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So rose gracie decided to eliminate all </v>

1725
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:09.831
<v Speaker 3>of that and make the gracie nationals a </v>
<v Speaker 3>submission only tournament.</v>

1726
01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:15.560
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she's also doing the Gracie worlds in </v>

1727
01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:17.460
<v Speaker 3>July,</v>
<v Speaker 3>July 15th in San Jose.</v>

1728
01:13:17.790 --> 01:13:18.870
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>finally,</v>

1729
01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:24.180
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're going to be able to get a world </v>

1730
01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:25.380
<v Speaker 3>title in a submission only format,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is the greatest.</v>

1731
01:13:25.381 --> 01:13:26.820
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's so much.</v>

1732
01:13:26.850 --> 01:13:31.140
<v Speaker 3>It means so much more to win in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>submission only tournament.</v>

1733
01:13:31.290 --> 01:13:36.290
<v Speaker 3>Then by points you're a world champion </v>
<v Speaker 3>and you won by an advantage world </v>

1734
01:13:36.781 --> 01:13:41.781
<v Speaker 3>champion at those days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does nothing for the development of </v>

1735
01:13:41.781 --> 01:13:46.581
<v Speaker 3>your Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just gets you better at holding and </v>

1736
01:13:46.581 --> 01:13:46.581
<v Speaker 3>installing out and running out the </v>
<v Speaker 3>clock.</v>

1737
01:13:46.581 --> 01:13:48.540
<v Speaker 3>It's just ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So mad.</v>

1738
01:13:48.541 --> 01:13:53.490
<v Speaker 3>Huge props to Rose Gray and her husband,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hobie Vasquez,</v>

1739
01:13:53.610 --> 01:13:57.000
<v Speaker 3>who put this tournament together and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>know,</v>

1740
01:13:58.140 --> 01:14:03.140
<v Speaker 3>I think this is the future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think a submission only format is the </v>

1741
01:14:03.140 --> 01:14:03.140
<v Speaker 3>only way to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1742
01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:06.520
<v Speaker 3>we're taking bias refs completely out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the gate.</v>

1743
01:14:06.810 --> 01:14:08.740
<v Speaker 3>The refs have nothing to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 3>game.</v>

1744
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:14.590
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well there's no time limited in the </v>

1745
01:14:14.590 --> 01:14:16.351
<v Speaker 3>final,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in the qualifying matches is a 15 </v>

1746
01:14:16.351 --> 01:14:17.740
<v Speaker 3>minute time limit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is plenty enough to have plenty of</v>

1747
01:14:17.741 --> 01:14:22.741
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if there is no submission in those </v>

1748
01:14:22.741 --> 01:14:22.750
<v Speaker 3>15 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both guys are out.</v>

1749
01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:23.680
<v Speaker 3>So it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's amazing.</v>

1750
01:14:23.681 --> 01:14:28.681
<v Speaker 3>We had sold are out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So if two guys are just like Marcello </v>

1751
01:14:28.681 --> 01:14:29.830
<v Speaker 3>Garcia and jake shields stall each other</v>
<v Speaker 3>out,</v>

1752
01:14:29.831 --> 01:14:31.060
<v Speaker 3>they're both out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

1753
01:14:31.061 --> 01:14:32.560
<v Speaker 3>that's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But in the finals,</v>

1754
01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:36.790
<v Speaker 3>no time that we had some epic matches.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Epic matches,</v>

1755
01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:42.380
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>10 planet San Francisco went 12 and one </v>

1756
01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:42.380

<v Speaker 3>got to over 30.</v>

1758
01:14:45.551 --> 01:14:47.350
<v Speaker 3>I lose track.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that crazy?</v>

1759
01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:50.140
<v Speaker 3>You started out just doing it as </v>
<v Speaker 3>something to do,</v>

1760
01:14:50.440 --> 01:14:50.980
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>what should I do?</v>

1762
01:14:51.641 --> 01:14:54.850
<v Speaker 3>Maybe I could teach now and then boom.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you got like an empire,</v>

1763
01:14:55.510 --> 01:14:56.650
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was all an accident.</v>

1764
01:14:56.680 --> 01:15:01.680
<v Speaker 3>It's weird in a weird.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought I thought that that when we </v>

1765
01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:04.621
<v Speaker 3>were working on the man show,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we were going to parlay that into some </v>

1766
01:15:04.621 --> 01:15:04.621
<v Speaker 3>trey parker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Matt Stone.</v>

1771
01:15:15.021 --> 01:15:18.261
<v Speaker 1>going to get a fucking comedy club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I decided while I was taking a shit </v>

01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:38.480
<v Speaker 2>Listen man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody needs to stand up for this </v>

1942
01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:40.540
<v Speaker 2>fucking the wacky world that we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>living in man and would anonymous </v>

1943
01:22:40.771 --> 01:22:41.970
<v Speaker 2>represents is the internet.</v>

1944
01:22:41.970 --> 01:22:46.970
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Internet represented most of the </v>

1945
01:22:46.970 --> 01:22:46.970
<v Speaker 2>time is justice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1946
01:22:46.970 --> 01:22:48.690
<v Speaker 2>most of what they go after,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of what they do is the right thing.</v>

1947
01:22:49.050 --> 01:22:54.050
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of shit that goes on like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this Dana white thing where they're </v>

1948
01:22:54.050 --> 01:22:54.050
<v Speaker 2>hacking into his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his,</v>

1949
01:22:54.050 --> 01:22:58.281
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social security and putting it all </v>

1950
01:22:58.281 --> 01:22:58.281
<v Speaker 2>online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's Douchey Shit.</v>

1951
01:22:58.281 --> 01:22:59.430
<v Speaker 2>I heard it was fake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I heard it wrong.</v>

1952
01:22:59.460 --> 01:23:00.570
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't fake.</v>

1953
01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:03.060
<v Speaker 2>They got the information that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand.</v>

1954
01:23:03.061 --> 01:23:06.040
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is dad's named Dana white as well and</v>

1955
01:23:06.041 --> 01:23:11.041
<v Speaker 2>they got a lot of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lot of the information they got was his </v>

1956
01:23:11.041 --> 01:23:12.961
<v Speaker 2>dad's including liens and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where his dad used to live and now some </v>

1957
01:23:12.961 --> 01:23:14.810
<v Speaker 2>other guy got harassed because they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1958
01:23:14.830 --> 01:23:19.830
<v Speaker 2>because his information got put online.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this guy like Dina had to go to this </v>

1959
01:23:19.830 --> 01:23:23.131
<v Speaker 2>guy's house and apologize to him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the kid is apparently a 13 year old </v>

1960
01:23:23.131 --> 01:23:24.160
<v Speaker 2>kid from Australia mean he doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>represent anonymous.</v>

1961
01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:29.160
<v Speaker 2>He represents people on the Internet </v>
<v Speaker 2>that don't like when people in the </v>

1962
01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:29.160
<v Speaker 2>Internet challenged them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1963
01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:29.980
<v Speaker 2>like you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't hack me.</v>

1964
01:23:29.981 --> 01:23:31.660
<v Speaker 2>I dare you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're going to hack,</v>

1965
01:23:31.661 --> 01:23:33.400
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to fucking hack you.</v>

1966
01:23:33.550 --> 01:23:36.520
<v Speaker 2>But that's not what.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I like about anonymous,</v>

1967
01:23:36.521 --> 01:23:40.690
<v Speaker 2>what I like is that what it represents </v>
<v Speaker 2>is people feel helpless.</v>

1968
01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:45.190
<v Speaker 2>They feel helpless to this gigantic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oppressive power that is controlling the</v>

1969
01:23:45.191 --> 01:23:47.110
<v Speaker 2>world and running things in a way that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't like.</v>

1970
01:23:47.230 --> 01:23:50.230
<v Speaker 2>And when these guys go after Department </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Homeland Security,</v>

1971
01:23:50.231 --> 01:23:52.630
<v Speaker 2>all these different websites,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when these guys try to take things down,</v>

1972
01:23:52.690 --> 01:23:55.030
<v Speaker 2>what they're doing is they're there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're lashing out,</v>

1973
01:23:55.031 --> 01:23:55.630
<v Speaker 2>and they're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1974
01:23:55.631 --> 01:23:57.700
<v Speaker 2>we can touch you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can reach you,</v>

1975
01:23:57.820 --> 01:24:02.820
<v Speaker 2>we can find your information.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like when they went after that guy that </v>

1976
01:24:02.820 --> 01:24:02.820
<v Speaker 2>pepper sprayed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those fucking kids in the face,</v>

1977
01:24:02.820 --> 01:24:07.590
<v Speaker 2>those kids at uc Berkeley that were just</v>
<v Speaker 2>sitting on their knees and they got all </v>

1978
01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:07.590
<v Speaker 2>that guy's information.</v>

1979
01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:11.700
<v Speaker 2>They put that shit online that I liked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I liked because that lets that guy </v>

1980
01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:11.700
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

1981
01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:15.440
<v Speaker 2>you can't do morally fucked up things </v>
<v Speaker 2>because you're doing it under the,</v>

1982
01:24:15.441 --> 01:24:15.790
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1983
01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:17.680
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the blanket of your job,</v>

1984
01:24:17.681 --> 01:24:22.681
<v Speaker 2>the umbrella of protection that you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think has offered you by being a police </v>

1985
01:24:22.681 --> 01:24:23.260
<v Speaker 2>officer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're doing something reprehensible,</v>

1986
01:24:23.261 --> 01:24:24.840
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're spraying kids in the face with,</v>

1987
01:24:24.930 --> 01:24:27.450
<v Speaker 2>with chemicals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you piece of shit for no reason.</v>

1988
01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:29.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you got to feel that man got,</v>

1989
01:24:29.050 --> 01:24:30.190
<v Speaker 2>feel that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know what man?</v>

1990
01:24:30.191 --> 01:24:32.710
<v Speaker 2>I saw a video where the people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to justify like,</v>

1991
01:24:32.711 --> 01:24:33.910
<v Speaker 2>listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what happened.</v>

1992
01:24:33.911 --> 01:24:36.100
<v Speaker 2>This is the full story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you saw was edited,</v>

1993
01:24:36.290 --> 01:24:38.170
<v Speaker 2>you know what they saw?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They saw the kids just sitting there for</v>

1994
01:24:38.171 --> 01:24:39.220
<v Speaker 2>a longer know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1995
01:24:39.221 --> 01:24:40.570
<v Speaker 2>They didn't move when they were told to </v>
<v Speaker 2>move.</v>

1996
01:24:40.571 --> 01:24:41.220
<v Speaker 2>That doesn't mean you get</v>

1997
01:24:41.230 --> 01:24:43.500
<v Speaker 6>the spray in the fucking face.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I heard there were some shit in La.</v>

1998
01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:48.540
<v Speaker 6>Was it oakland re the other day and the </v>
<v Speaker 6>cops were arrested like a crazy amount </v>

1999
01:24:48.881 --> 01:24:50.710
<v Speaker 6>of people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>like 120 or 30 people,</v>

2000
01:24:50.711 --> 01:24:53.590
<v Speaker 6>but they were tear gassing and there was</v>
<v Speaker 6>like kids.</v>

2001
01:24:53.591 --> 01:24:58.591
<v Speaker 6>They're like one.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it's probably the best </v>

2002
01:24:58.591 --> 01:24:59.110
<v Speaker 6>idea to be bringing your kids to things </v>
<v Speaker 6>like this.</v>

2003
01:24:59.870 --> 01:25:02.030
<v Speaker 2>Assholes who are bringing their kids to </v>
<v Speaker 2>these rallies because these things,</v>

2004
01:25:02.660 --> 01:25:05.060
<v Speaker 2>things can break out in violence at any </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>

2005
01:25:05.061 --> 01:25:07.600
<v Speaker 2>Especially in Oakland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oakland is kind of crazy man.</v>

2006
01:25:07.630 --> 01:25:09.740
<v Speaker 2>Too Short.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2007
01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:11.210
<v Speaker 2>Short dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2008
01:25:11.211 --> 01:25:13.390
<v Speaker 2>Oakland is not to be fucked with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2009
01:25:13.610 --> 01:25:17.840
<v Speaker 2>Oakland's a tricky place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You be in just for the hub for that shit</v>

2010
01:25:17.870 --> 01:25:20.030
<v Speaker 2>for the last 40 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have no.</v>

2011
01:25:20.580 --> 01:25:23.750
<v Speaker 2>They play it every year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's where they go up there.</v>

2012
01:25:23.751 --> 01:25:26.360
<v Speaker 2>These people know how to react to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The sick and tired of it too.</v>

2013
01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:29.000
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it takes two to tango,</v>

2014
01:25:29.001 --> 01:25:32.540
<v Speaker 2>but I love the idea of somebody checking</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody.</v>

2015
01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:34.970
<v Speaker 2>I've always loved the idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen man,</v>

2016
01:25:34.971 --> 01:25:37.190
<v Speaker 2>I grew up in fucking death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wish you know what?</v>

2017
01:25:37.191 --> 01:25:39.350
<v Speaker 2>The cops can't be there for you all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking time.</v>

2018
01:25:39.351 --> 01:25:44.351
<v Speaker 2>I love the idea of somebody blast on the</v>
<v Speaker 2>motherfucker when you fucking do </v>

2019
01:25:44.351 --> 01:25:44.450
<v Speaker 2>something wrong.</v>

2020
01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:46.760
<v Speaker 2>That's the best way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I love it.</v>

2021
01:25:46.820 --> 01:25:47.660
<v Speaker 2>I'd love to.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Net.</v>

2022
01:25:47.690 --> 01:25:49.970
<v Speaker 2>I think at the Internet is eventually </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be the government.</v>

2023
01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:55.000
<v Speaker 2>That's what I think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think the way that we're going to </v>

2024
01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:56.621
<v Speaker 2>govern things just through the Internet </v>
<v Speaker 2>because instead of these oppressive </v>

2025
01:25:56.621 --> 01:25:58.991
<v Speaker 2>groups that see what what really fucks </v>
<v Speaker 2>us is that we don't really get a say in </v>

2026
01:25:59.001 --> 01:25:59.630
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2027
01:25:59.631 --> 01:26:04.631
<v Speaker 2>we get to do is we get a representative.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We get to choose a representative and </v>

2028
01:26:04.631 --> 01:26:08.471
<v Speaker 2>they almost all get into office and </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately just do whatever the fuck </v>

2029
01:26:08.471 --> 01:26:10.070
<v Speaker 2>incorporations that got them into power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>asked them to do.</v>

2030
01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:15.100
<v Speaker 2>That's what they do immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They pass a bunch of bills like the </v>

2031
01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:16.280
<v Speaker 2>national defense authorization act that </v>
<v Speaker 2>everybody's going crazy about that.</v>

2032
01:26:16.281 --> 01:26:21.281
<v Speaker 2>Obama passed that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said he would veto all of that stuff </v>

2033
01:26:21.281 --> 01:26:22.640
<v Speaker 2>is stopped.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you put that for vote to America,</v>

2034
01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:24.940
<v Speaker 2>like at on the online,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you want?</v>

2035
01:26:25.010 --> 01:26:26.810
<v Speaker 2>What do you guys want to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No fucking way.</v>

2036
01:26:26.811 --> 01:26:31.811
<v Speaker 2>We would vote for that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Were you going to arrest us and detain </v>

2037
01:26:31.811 --> 01:26:34.541
<v Speaker 2>us with no warrant?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what people have to realize is </v>

2038
01:26:34.541 --> 01:26:35.540
<v Speaker 2>the people that you're saying yes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>

2039
01:26:35.690 --> 01:26:37.280
<v Speaker 2>when you make a law and you say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

2040
01:26:37.281 --> 01:26:42.281
<v Speaker 2>here's the law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people today may not be the same </v>

2041
01:26:42.281 --> 01:26:45.731
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're saying yes to 20 years from now </v>

2042
01:26:45.731 --> 01:26:47.950
<v Speaker 2>or even 10 years from now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can put laws into place that give </v>

2043
01:26:47.950 --> 01:26:48.350
<v Speaker 2>evil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>corrupt people.</v>

2044
01:26:48.351 --> 01:26:53.351
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying Obama Zebulon corrupt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm saying what he did is an evil </v>

2045
01:26:53.351 --> 01:26:54.020
<v Speaker 2>and corrupt thing and he opened the door</v>
<v Speaker 2>for evil and corruption.</v>

2046
01:26:54.021 --> 01:26:56.480
<v Speaker 2>No doubt about it because if someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to do that,</v>

2047
01:26:56.481 --> 01:26:59.360
<v Speaker 2>some future Douchebag,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some Dick Cheney of the future.</v>

2048
01:26:59.450 --> 01:27:02.900
<v Speaker 2>If he gets into a position and in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>national defense authorization act is in</v>

2049
01:27:02.901 --> 01:27:03.890
<v Speaker 2>place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>guess what?</v>

2050
01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:06.980
<v Speaker 2>A bunch of people going to go to fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>jail that are just protesting.</v>

2051
01:27:06.981 --> 01:27:11.981
<v Speaker 2>The government have got a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people going to go to jail for </v>

2052
01:27:11.981 --> 01:27:11.981
<v Speaker 2>obstructing the.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way the United States runs,</v>

2053
01:27:11.981 --> 01:27:13.520
<v Speaker 2>they're going to go to jail as enemies </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the state.</v>

2054
01:27:13.700 --> 01:27:15.170
<v Speaker 2>That's real shit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2055
01:27:15.171 --> 01:27:20.171
<v Speaker 2>and that none of that would take place </v>
<v Speaker 2>if the Internet was how we did our </v>

2056
01:27:20.171 --> 01:27:21.710
<v Speaker 2>government and it sounds ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but why shouldn't it be that way?</v>

2057
01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:26.880
<v Speaker 2>What what our government is supposed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>represent is what the people want and </v>

2058
01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:29.270
<v Speaker 2>what the people want can easily be found</v>
<v Speaker 2>out on the Internet.</v>

2059
01:27:29.330 --> 01:27:34.330
<v Speaker 2>It's easiest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the easiest way to contact people and </v>

2060
01:27:34.330 --> 01:27:34.790
<v Speaker 2>find out exactly what the fuck they want</v>
<v Speaker 2>regardless of nationality,</v>

2061
01:27:34.791 --> 01:27:37.820
<v Speaker 2>regardless of the state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where they live in is the internet.</v>

2062
01:27:37.970 --> 01:27:39.650
<v Speaker 2>That is how things are going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>ruled.</v>

2063
01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:44.740
<v Speaker 2>It used to be you had to go to a place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had to write down what you thought </v>

2064
01:27:44.740 --> 01:27:45.620
<v Speaker 2>and put it in a fucking box and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>how they decided things.</v>

2065
01:27:45.650 --> 01:27:46.970
<v Speaker 2>You only because that was the only way </v>
<v Speaker 2>to do it.</v>

2066
01:27:46.971 --> 01:27:51.971
<v Speaker 2>Any problem with that though is there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>more opportunity for hacking and things </v>

2067
01:27:51.971 --> 01:27:51.971
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately.</v>

2068
01:27:51.971 --> 01:27:53.240
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right now there is.</v>

2069
01:27:53.241 --> 01:27:54.200
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you know what,</v>

2070
01:27:54.230 --> 01:27:55.730
<v Speaker 2>that can be worked out too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know what,</v>

2071
01:27:55.731 --> 01:28:00.731
<v Speaker 2>that's also in part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of that is in place because also </v>

2072
01:28:00.731 --> 01:28:01.220
<v Speaker 2>because of corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at the fucking.</v>

2073
01:28:01.221 --> 01:28:03.410
<v Speaker 2>The computerized voting machines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2074
01:28:03.620 --> 01:28:08.620
<v Speaker 2>If you don't know about this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>watch a documentary called hacking </v>

2075
01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:11.291
<v Speaker 2>democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was something that was on Hbo Awhile </v>

2076
01:28:11.291 --> 01:28:11.291
<v Speaker 2>back where they showed that these </v>
<v Speaker 2>machines,</v>

2077
01:28:11.291 --> 01:28:14.750
<v Speaker 2>these diebold machines are designed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be altered.</v>

2078
01:28:14.870 --> 01:28:19.870
<v Speaker 2>They're designed so that a third party </v>
<v Speaker 2>can come in and change the results and </v>

2079
01:28:19.870 --> 01:28:21.590
<v Speaker 2>they were so fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They changed their name.</v>

2080
01:28:21.591 --> 01:28:24.220
<v Speaker 2>Diebold isn't even diebold anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll find out what the fuck her name,</v>

01:28:24.221 --> 01:28:29.221
<v Speaker 2>ours now so he can't be tricked,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we live in a corrupt system and the </v>

2082
01:28:29.240 --> 01:28:34.240
<v Speaker 2>what the Internet recognizes is that the</v>
<v Speaker 2>will of the people is not being </v>

2083
01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:38.951
<v Speaker 2>represented what's being represented as </v>
<v Speaker 2>the corporations and that's why </v>

<v Speaker 2>everybody's hovering around all these </v>

2088

<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah man.</v>

2089
01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:58.960
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had to short on a podcast last night </v>

2090
01:28:58.960 --> 01:28:58.960
<v Speaker 2>and it was really amazed at the rapper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the rapper,</v>

2091
01:28:59.370 --> 01:29:01.890
<v Speaker 2>he has like 19 albums out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but of the cool things</v>

2092
01:29:02.130 --> 01:29:06.120
<v Speaker 6>hearing him talk about was a big.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He started off so early in the game that</v>

2093
01:29:06.121 --> 01:29:11.121
<v Speaker 6>people didn't even know what rap was.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And like he would just like open up his </v>

2094
01:29:11.121 --> 01:29:13.350
<v Speaker 6>car doors to and they have like a beat </v>
<v Speaker 6>playing and just rap,</v>

<v Speaker 6>like really loud with it.</v>

2096
01:29:16.950 --> 01:29:18.780

<v Speaker 6>he's like,</v>

2097
01:29:18.781 --> 01:29:19.620

2098
01:29:19.621 --> 01:29:22.020
<v Speaker 6>I want to have that.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And then he just popped the cassette and</v>

2099
01:29:22.021 --> 01:29:24.660
<v Speaker 6>sold it to him for five bucks and then </v>
<v Speaker 6>he started selling it to like,</v>

2100
01:29:24.661 --> 01:29:26.580
<v Speaker 6>all the drug dealers want heard about </v>
<v Speaker 6>it.</v>

2101
01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:27.970
<v Speaker 6>And they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>that lived in Oakland,</v>

2102
01:29:27.971 --> 01:29:32.971

<v Speaker 6>I don't know.</v>

2116
01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:06.860
<v Speaker 6>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I said,</v>

2117
01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:08.220
<v Speaker 6>why can't you release it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Two Bucks.</v>

2118
01:30:08.221 --> 01:30:08.910
<v Speaker 6>Family?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

2119
01:30:08.911 --> 01:30:10.320
<v Speaker 6>I think it was a family thing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think.</v>

2120
01:30:10.620 --> 01:30:11.150
<v Speaker 6>I think the people</v>

2121
01:30:11.190 --> 01:30:16.190
<v Speaker 1>powers of be diebold changed his name to</v>
<v Speaker 1>premier election solutions incorporated </v>

2122
01:30:16.190 --> 01:30:18.510
<v Speaker 1>or p e s I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the new diebold.</v>

2123
01:30:18.630 --> 01:30:23.630
<v Speaker 1>Isn't it funny when companies do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get caught doing something fucked </v>

2124
01:30:23.630 --> 01:30:26.391
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they just changed the name and they </v>

2125
01:30:26.391 --> 01:30:26.391
<v Speaker 1>just were evil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever.</v>

2126
01:30:26.391 --> 01:30:28.350
<v Speaker 1>You got to blackwater did the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

2127
01:30:28.351 --> 01:30:29.440
<v Speaker 1>They changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The man was.</v>

2128
01:30:30.270 --> 01:30:31.520
<v Speaker 1>I'll find out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How far do you,</v>

2129
01:30:31.590 --> 01:30:36.590
<v Speaker 6>I think anonymous can go.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Do you think that could ever get shut </v>

2130
01:30:36.590 --> 01:30:36.590
<v Speaker 6>down?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Can they know it's impossible?</v>

2131
01:30:36.590 --> 01:30:40.410
<v Speaker 6>The idea.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Because I think a lot of people get </v>

2132
01:30:40.410 --> 01:30:42.451
<v Speaker 6>confused what in anonymous is the whole </v>
<v Speaker 6>point why they can't get shut down </v>

2133
01:30:42.451 --> 01:30:42.451
<v Speaker 6>because no one knows who the fuck they </v>
<v Speaker 6>are.</v>

2134
01:30:42.451 --> 01:30:45.340
<v Speaker 6>There's tons of figure it out.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There's tons of people though,</v>

2135
01:30:45.450 --> 01:30:46.840
<v Speaker 6>will.</v>
<v Speaker 6>If they started arresting people,</v>

2136
01:30:46.870 --> 01:30:51.870
<v Speaker 6>it would be the most impossible thing </v>
<v Speaker 6>that'd be like trying to have an army </v>

2137
01:30:51.870 --> 01:30:53.020
<v Speaker 6>put together that attacks the whole </v>
<v Speaker 6>world.</v>

2138
01:30:53.070 --> 01:30:55.510
<v Speaker 6>It would be like world war for real </v>
<v Speaker 6>world.</v>

2139
01:30:55.510 --> 01:30:56.990
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blackwater.</v>

2140
01:30:57.040 --> 01:30:59.020
<v Speaker 1>So fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They change their name twice.</v>

2141
01:30:59.410 --> 01:31:04.410
<v Speaker 1>They changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They went from blackwater to x e and </v>

2142
01:31:04.410 --> 01:31:07.351
<v Speaker 1>then they went from x e to academic with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new logo.</v>

2143
01:31:07.870 --> 01:31:10.600
<v Speaker 1>They just changed their name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They figured this.</v>

2144
01:31:10.870 --> 01:31:12.760
<v Speaker 1>No one's going to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just keep changing it,</v>

2145
01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:13.660
<v Speaker 1>keep changing it.</v>

2146
01:31:13.730 --> 01:31:15.170
<v Speaker 6>Stopping anonymous would be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

2147
01:31:15.171 --> 01:31:20.171
<v Speaker 6>they could spend all this money and time</v>
<v Speaker 6>and they'll find some 13 year old in </v>

2148
01:31:20.171 --> 01:31:20.171
<v Speaker 6>Australia and then there's like a </v>
<v Speaker 6>million.</v>

2149
01:31:20.470 --> 01:31:21.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is that guy,</v>

2150
01:31:21.451 --> 01:31:21.980
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

2151
01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:23.740
<v Speaker 1>what can they do to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

2152
01:31:23.741 --> 01:31:28.741
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to prosecute people that the catch and </v>

2153
01:31:28.741 --> 01:31:30.750
<v Speaker 1>how far they can go as far as shutting </v>
<v Speaker 1>things down and controlling the </v>

2154
01:31:30.750 --> 01:31:33.541
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what people worried about what </v>

2155
01:31:33.541 --> 01:31:33.541
<v Speaker 1>this Sofa with this sofa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're worried about.</v>

2156
01:31:33.541 --> 01:31:34.900
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not the people you're saying yes to</v>

2157
01:31:34.901 --> 01:31:36.340
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might not be the same people you're</v>

2158
01:31:36.341 --> 01:31:41.341
<v Speaker 1>saying yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 years from now and if you give the </v>

2159
01:31:41.341 --> 01:31:41.341
<v Speaker 1>government the ability to just shut down</v>
<v Speaker 1>websites,</v>

2160
01:31:41.341 --> 01:31:44.560
<v Speaker 1>which by the way they already do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just did with Mega upload.</v>

2161
01:31:44.660 --> 01:31:44.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2162
01:31:45.090 --> 01:31:47.280
<v Speaker 1>they just closed down mega upload.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so,</v>

2163
01:31:47.400 --> 01:31:50.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm so bummed about mega upload,</v>
<v Speaker 1>closing to a good website.</v>

2164
01:31:50.590 --> 01:31:52.120
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let's play devil's advocate.</v>

2165
01:31:52.350 --> 01:31:57.350
<v Speaker 1>They close mega upload because they said</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Mega upload has a bunch of </v>

2166
01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:58.510
<v Speaker 1>different illegal files on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like where's,</v>

2167
01:31:58.511 --> 01:32:03.511
<v Speaker 1>and they have a of like movies and shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>that screeners and mp3s if there's a </v>

2168
01:32:03.521 --> 01:32:08.521
<v Speaker 1>website should.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you're offering that service to </v>

2169
01:32:08.521 --> 01:32:09.490
<v Speaker 1>people where they can just upload shit </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you sell advertisement,</v>

2170
01:32:09.491 --> 01:32:10.270
<v Speaker 1>which they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2171
01:32:10.271 --> 01:32:12.450
<v Speaker 1>Isn't that how they work that shit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they sell subscriber.</v>

2172
01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:17.680
<v Speaker 6>I think if you have a free account,</v>
<v Speaker 6>there's limitations and they serve </v>

2173
01:32:17.680 --> 01:32:20.831
<v Speaker 6>advertising.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think they also have a paid account </v>

2174
01:32:20.831 --> 01:32:23.321
<v Speaker 6>that I don't think has advertising,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think what it is is that it </v>

2175
01:32:23.321 --> 01:32:24.380
<v Speaker 6>shouldn't be the company's fault.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It should be the user.</v>

2176
01:32:24.381 --> 01:32:29.381
<v Speaker 6>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they find dances with wolves on Mega </v>

2177
01:32:29.381 --> 01:32:33.370
<v Speaker 6>Upload Server.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They find out who uploaded a day bust </v>

2178
01:32:33.370 --> 01:32:35.291
<v Speaker 6>him.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it should be mega uploads </v>

2179
01:32:35.291 --> 01:32:36.690
<v Speaker 6>fault for having a service where you can</v>
<v Speaker 6>legally you're supposed to share file,</v>

2180
01:32:37.030 --> 01:32:38.210
<v Speaker 6>but let's play devil's advocate.</v>

2181
01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:43.390
<v Speaker 1>Let's play devil's advocate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you do have a service where you're </v>

2182
01:32:43.390 --> 01:32:44.450
<v Speaker 1>just sharing files and providing </v>
<v Speaker 1>bandwidth,</v>

2183
01:32:44.780 --> 01:32:49.780
<v Speaker 1>you should be responsible for how much </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that stuff is pirated because </v>

2184
01:32:49.780 --> 01:32:50.670
<v Speaker 1>otherwise you're a distribution angle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're.</v>

2185
01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:53.810
<v Speaker 1>You're essentially a distribution </v>
<v Speaker 1>highway for illegal shit.</v>

2186
01:32:53.840 --> 01:32:57.950
<v Speaker 6>I think maybe yes you should be,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I think it should be more of like,</v>

2187
01:32:58.490 --> 01:33:03.290
<v Speaker 6>I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>sharing of a personal information.</v>

2188
01:33:03.291 --> 01:33:05.780
<v Speaker 6>If you are doing something illegal </v>
<v Speaker 6>should be allowed.</v>

2189
01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:07.640
<v Speaker 6>Maybe hearing a personal meaning like </v>
<v Speaker 6>if,</v>

2190
01:33:07.641 --> 01:33:08.140
<v Speaker 6>if,</v>
<v Speaker 6>if,</v>

2191
01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:10.520
<v Speaker 6>if the FBI comes to mega app logos,</v>
<v Speaker 6>look,</v>

2192
01:33:10.730 --> 01:33:14.150
<v Speaker 6>we know that you have dances with wolves</v>
<v Speaker 6>on your server and they're like,</v>

2193
01:33:14.151 --> 01:33:16.520
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>we need to know who this user rising.</v>

2194
01:33:16.580 --> 01:33:18.470
<v Speaker 6>I think then mega upload should be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>okay,</v>

2195
01:33:18.471 --> 01:33:20.990
<v Speaker 6>here's the person's there for really </v>
<v Speaker 6>using this should give you up.</v>

2196
01:33:21.300 --> 01:33:26.300
<v Speaker 6>If you're doing illegal stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it should be mega uploads </v>

2197
01:33:26.300 --> 01:33:29.140
<v Speaker 6>fault.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I don't think mega upload as a </v>

2198
01:33:29.140 --> 01:33:30.611
<v Speaker 6>corporation should be shut down and for </v>
<v Speaker 6>a business because you want to share </v>

2199
01:33:30.611 --> 01:33:30.611
<v Speaker 6>dances with wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well you know</v>

2200
01:33:30.611 --> 01:33:32.560
<v Speaker 1>better the corporation be shut down in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the user's going to jail.</v>

2201
01:33:32.620 --> 01:33:37.620
<v Speaker 1>That's the other devil's advocate is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that these are just kids and they don't </v>

2202
01:33:37.620 --> 01:33:37.620
<v Speaker 1>know any better and they think they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to get away with it and they think</v>

2203
01:33:37.620 --> 01:33:42.331
<v Speaker 1>they're just helping people out by </v>
<v Speaker 1>providing files that everybody wants to </v>

2204
01:33:42.331 --> 01:33:42.331
<v Speaker 1>get ahold of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2205
01:33:42.331 --> 01:33:42.910
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pro,</v>

2206
01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:48.000
<v Speaker 1>the real problem is people have kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>grown up knowing that they can get shit </v>

2207
01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:48.490
<v Speaker 1>for free now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2208
01:33:48.530 --> 01:33:50.530
<v Speaker 1>that's like sort of how they're.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how people feel.</v>

2209
01:33:50.531 --> 01:33:52.150
<v Speaker 1>They feel like shit is free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2210
01:33:52.151 --> 01:33:53.260
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can get movies for free.</v>

2211
01:33:53.261 --> 01:33:58.261
<v Speaker 1>They joke around about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've had people joke around on my own </v>

2212
01:33:58.261 --> 01:33:58.420
<v Speaker 1>website about stealing my shit online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think it's cute,</v>

2213
01:33:58.630 --> 01:33:59.260
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2214
01:33:59.290 --> 01:34:00.820
<v Speaker 1>I'll get the torrent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lol,</v>

2215
01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:01.930
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you're like,</v>

2216
01:34:01.931 --> 01:34:02.690
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2217
01:34:02.710 --> 01:34:04.490
<v Speaker 1>like right in front of you knowing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2218
01:34:05.530 --> 01:34:07.120
<v Speaker 1>it's just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is what it is.</v>

2219
01:34:07.420 --> 01:34:08.710
<v Speaker 1>That's who you want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

2220
01:34:08.711 --> 01:34:13.711
<v Speaker 1>that's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's like they're so accustomed to </v>

2221
01:34:13.711 --> 01:34:14.860
<v Speaker 1>stealing that they talk about it openly </v>
<v Speaker 1>in front of the person's face,</v>

2222
01:34:14.861 --> 01:34:17.350
<v Speaker 1>on the website of the person who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>selling the shit.</v>

2223
01:34:17.450 --> 01:34:19.580
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But that's just ignorance and stupidity.</v>

2224
01:34:19.581 --> 01:34:21.040
<v Speaker 6>But yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So they,</v>

2225
01:34:21.190 --> 01:34:23.000
<v Speaker 6>they feel obligated,</v>
<v Speaker 6>not obligated.</v>

2226
01:34:23.001 --> 01:34:25.400
<v Speaker 6>They feel like they're entitled,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know what it should be.</v>

2227
01:34:25.460 --> 01:34:27.980
<v Speaker 6>It shouldn't be throwing people in </v>
<v Speaker 6>prison.</v>

2228
01:34:28.040 --> 01:34:29.480
<v Speaker 6>I don't think it should be like,</v>
<v Speaker 6>yeah,</v>

2229
01:34:29.481 --> 01:34:31.610
<v Speaker 6>you,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you were sharing dances with wolves with</v>

2230
01:34:31.611 --> 01:34:36.611
<v Speaker 6>seven other people and I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 6>that person should go to prison for 20 </v>

2231
01:34:36.611 --> 01:34:39.761
<v Speaker 6>years.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think you should have some kind of </v>

2232
01:34:39.761 --> 01:34:39.761
<v Speaker 6>thing like maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Right.</v>

2233
01:34:39.761 --> 01:34:39.761
<v Speaker 6>You're not allowed to have the Internet </v>
<v Speaker 6>for a year.</v>

2234
01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:42.150
<v Speaker 6>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Kevin Mitnick</v>

2235
01:34:42.320 --> 01:34:43.580
<v Speaker 1>punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what they did to him,</v>

2236
01:34:43.581 --> 01:34:44.630
<v Speaker 1>but the real issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian,</v>

2237
01:34:44.631 --> 01:34:47.230
<v Speaker 1>is that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that actually has crushed industries.</v>

2238
01:34:47.490 --> 01:34:50.690
<v Speaker 1>You look at the music industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the music industry is fucked.</v>

2239
01:34:50.930 --> 01:34:52.040
<v Speaker 1>You know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2240
01:34:52.730 --> 01:34:57.730
<v Speaker 1>one of the things that Dana White didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait actually wants to come on the </v>

2241
01:34:57.730 --> 01:34:57.730
<v Speaker 1>podcast and he wants to talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

2242
01:34:57.730 --> 01:35:01.860
<v Speaker 1>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's talk about all the shit that </v>

2243
01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:01.860
<v Speaker 1>happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2244
01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:01.860
<v Speaker 1>I talked about interviewing on my own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me interview for UFC.</v>

2245
01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:01.990
<v Speaker 1>It got DOTCOM.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2246
01:35:01.991 --> 01:35:02.690
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'd be better.</v>

2247
01:35:02.691 --> 01:35:03.950
<v Speaker 1>Let's do your podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

2248
01:35:03.951 --> 01:35:04.850
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll do it.</v>

2249
01:35:04.851 --> 01:35:06.140
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to figure out when to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2250
01:35:06.680 --> 01:35:09.620
<v Speaker 1>And so he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's totally into free speech.</v>

2251
01:35:09.621 --> 01:35:11.900
<v Speaker 1>You just don't want him any ripping off </v>
<v Speaker 1>his fucking product.</v>

2252
01:35:12.050 --> 01:35:12.680
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2253
01:35:12.710 --> 01:35:13.110
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2254
01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:18.140
<v Speaker 1>the amount of piracy is so widespread </v>
<v Speaker 1>that people were actually pirating </v>

2255
01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:22.331
<v Speaker 1>streams and then showing them in bars </v>
<v Speaker 1>and charging people to go to those bars </v>

2256
01:35:22.331 --> 01:35:23.000
<v Speaker 1>to watch pirated streams.</v>

2257
01:35:23.030 --> 01:35:25.910
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely cases like that day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously that's,</v>

2258
01:35:26.390 --> 01:35:27.590
<v Speaker 1>that should be attacked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2259
01:35:27.591 --> 01:35:30.410
<v Speaker 1>there's also people that put streams up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then they sell advertising.</v>

2260
01:35:30.411 --> 01:35:33.320
<v Speaker 1>They have Google ads and they actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2261
01:35:33.730 --> 01:35:36.710
<v Speaker 1>it's not just like a free thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're making money off of the stream.</v>

2262
01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:37.680
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2263
01:35:37.690 --> 01:35:38.540
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a big,</v>

2264
01:35:38.541 --> 01:35:41.300
<v Speaker 1>there's a big difference between that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That person is putting that up there and</v>

2265
01:35:41.301 --> 01:35:46.301
<v Speaker 1>making money for people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thousands of people that are coming to </v>

2266
01:35:46.301 --> 01:35:47.270
<v Speaker 1>the site and the person who's 14 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>old can't afford the UFC,</v>

2267
01:35:47.271 --> 01:35:48.680
<v Speaker 1>who's downloading it for free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2268
01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:51.650
<v Speaker 1>So that's what the real issue is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they're really.</v>

2269
01:35:51.740 --> 01:35:56.740
<v Speaker 1>What they're really concerned about is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the people that are actually profiting </v>

2270
01:35:56.740 --> 01:35:57.230
<v Speaker 1>off pirating their shit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

2271
01:35:57.231 --> 01:35:59.240
<v Speaker 1>And so it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a tricky thing.</v>

2272
01:35:59.250 --> 01:36:04.250
<v Speaker 1>Like my take on it has always been that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet without a doubt has </v>

2273
01:36:04.250 --> 01:36:06.830
<v Speaker 1>promoted me and helped me more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

2274
01:36:06.830 --> 01:36:11.830
<v Speaker 1>So the more people that have stolen my </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff means the more people who have </v>

2275
01:36:11.830 --> 01:36:12.200
<v Speaker 1>enjoyed my stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means the more people will come to</v>

2276
01:36:12.201 --> 01:36:13.910
<v Speaker 1>see me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more people will come.</v>

2277
01:36:13.911 --> 01:36:15.930
<v Speaker 1>Like this Chicago show or anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2278
01:36:15.950 --> 01:36:19.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the purpose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could easily charge for this podcast.</v>

2279
01:36:19.101 --> 01:36:20.480
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of you probably willing to pay,</v>

2280
01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:25.840
<v Speaker 1>but we know a lot of people that make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of money every month because of </v>

2281
01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:25.840
<v Speaker 1>their podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2282
01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:29.771
<v Speaker 1>they have subscriptions where they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>like one extra podcast they do every </v>

2283
01:36:29.771 --> 01:36:33.311
<v Speaker 1>month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think the best way to do it is to </v>

2284
01:36:33.311 --> 01:36:33.680
<v Speaker 1>give as much people as much shit for </v>
<v Speaker 1>free as possible.</v>

2285
01:36:33.740 --> 01:36:35.690
<v Speaker 1>But that's also because we're live </v>
<v Speaker 1>performers,</v>

2286
01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:37.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how we see it.</v>

2287
01:36:37.401 --> 01:36:37.780
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're,</v>

2288
01:36:37.790 --> 01:36:40.140
<v Speaker 1>we're live performances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the key to for us as you know,</v>

2289
01:36:40.190 --> 01:36:41.270
<v Speaker 1>come out and see us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2290
01:36:41.310 --> 01:36:46.310
<v Speaker 6>devil's advocate on the devil's advocate</v>
<v Speaker 6>of the UFC UFC thing is that honestly </v>

2291
01:36:48.301 --> 01:36:53.240
<v Speaker 6>there's 60 bucks and nowadays there's </v>
<v Speaker 6>like two or three UFC.</v>

2292
01:36:53.250 --> 01:36:55.770
<v Speaker 6>He's a month sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Even to me,</v>

2293
01:36:55.830 --> 01:37:00.060
<v Speaker 6>I liked the UFC to a bit like I,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I know if I was a hardcore UFC guy,</v>

2294
01:37:00.070 --> 01:37:01.010
<v Speaker 6>I'd order everything.</v>

2295
01:37:01.060 --> 01:37:02.710
<v Speaker 1>It's a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know that's a lot on.</v>

2296
01:37:02.820 --> 01:37:03.240
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

2297
01:37:03.270 --> 01:37:03.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't argue with</v>

2298
01:37:03.980 --> 01:37:06.770
<v Speaker 6>that's $180.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I think sometimes it's every week.</v>

2299
01:37:06.830 --> 01:37:09.890
<v Speaker 6>I think that if UFC was smart and a lot </v>
<v Speaker 6>of these people were smart,</v>

2300
01:37:09.891 --> 01:37:12.350
<v Speaker 6>they would do a subscription based thing</v>
<v Speaker 6>like you're paying 20 bucks a month,</v>

2301
01:37:12.351 --> 01:37:13.310
<v Speaker 6>you get everything use,</v>

2302
01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:18.500
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what else would be kind of dope if they </v>

2303
01:37:18.500 --> 01:37:19.770
<v Speaker 1>had it laid the way Hbo pay per view has</v>
<v Speaker 1>it where you are if you like,</v>

2304
01:37:19.771 --> 01:37:24.771
<v Speaker 1>don't want to watch Oscar de la Hoya </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight or floyd mayweather fight and hbo </v>

2305
01:37:24.771 --> 01:37:25.920
<v Speaker 1>pay per view next week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next Friday.</v>

2306
01:37:25.921 --> 01:37:28.210
<v Speaker 1>It's for free on HBO.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2307
01:37:28.211 --> 01:37:29.220
<v Speaker 1>that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be pretty,</v>

2308
01:37:29.310 --> 01:37:30.510
<v Speaker 1>pretty dope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with,</v>

2309
01:37:30.511 --> 01:37:32.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if like they had like huge cards,</v>

2310
01:37:32.521 --> 01:37:37.521
<v Speaker 1>like say Alistair Overeem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight junior dos Santos and it's a big </v>

2311
01:37:37.521 --> 01:37:40.491
<v Speaker 1>paper of card.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How I'll throw it on Fox the next </v>

2312
01:37:40.491 --> 01:37:40.491
<v Speaker 1>Friday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2313
01:37:40.491 --> 01:37:43.961
<v Speaker 1>you could watch a replay and that way </v>
<v Speaker 1>also they'll know that they're going to </v>

2314
01:37:43.961 --> 01:37:44.160
<v Speaker 1>put on some bad ass fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if it's some,</v>

2315
01:37:44.370 --> 01:37:46.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it's one of those fights,</v>

2316
01:37:46.620 --> 01:37:51.620
<v Speaker 1>it's not the most entertaining fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I live fights are much better </v>

2317
01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:52.890
<v Speaker 1>shore for Fox.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's not fox,</v>

2318
01:37:52.891 --> 01:37:55.920
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's an fx thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>showed on fx the week after.</v>

2319
01:37:56.130 --> 01:38:01.130
<v Speaker 4>Not a bad idea,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the thing about MMA is a lot of </v>

2320
01:38:01.130 --> 01:38:03.381
<v Speaker 4>people by the replays,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they'll buy it again and they'll bite </v>

2321
01:38:03.381 --> 01:38:03.381
<v Speaker 4>level.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're here about how good it is.</v>

2322
01:38:03.381 --> 01:38:07.651
<v Speaker 4>And they'll buy the replay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That probably kills a venue thing about </v>

2323
01:38:07.651 --> 01:38:07.760
<v Speaker 4>two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>WHATSAPP,</v>

2324
01:38:07.890 --> 01:38:12.890
<v Speaker 4>that kills it about two weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you've got to get all the money you </v>

2325
01:38:12.890 --> 01:38:12.890
<v Speaker 4>can,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2326
01:38:12.890 --> 01:38:14.490
<v Speaker 4>what he was doing over the years is </v>
<v Speaker 4>after a fight,</v>

2327
01:38:14.850 --> 01:38:16.910
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they would put it up to use a leash,</v>

2328
01:38:16.990 --> 01:38:21.990
<v Speaker 4>maybe six months.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now they fucking put it up at UFC at </v>

2329
01:38:21.990 --> 01:38:21.990
<v Speaker 4>least a month later.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

2330
01:38:21.990 --> 01:38:23.370
<v Speaker 4>That's good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's really fucking good.</v>

2331
01:38:23.600 --> 01:38:24.190
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

<v Speaker 4>the pride they were doing before.</v>

2347
01:38:58.860 --> 01:39:01.500
<v Speaker 4>They eliminated a lot of shit that you </v>

2376
01:40:10.671 --> 01:40:14.780
<v Speaker 3>like with itunes and Torrance is not </v>
<v Speaker 3>good as people.</v>

2377
01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:18.140
<v Speaker 3>I mean the whole industry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the record industry just fell apart.</v>

2378
01:40:18.410 --> 01:40:21.290
<v Speaker 3>But what's happening and I know they got</v>
<v Speaker 3>to feel this,</v>

2379
01:40:21.650 --> 01:40:26.390
<v Speaker 3>but I'm buying all my old shit on </v>
<v Speaker 3>itunes.</v>

2380
01:40:26.540 --> 01:40:31.540
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to pull out the CD's and </v>
<v Speaker 3>load them into my computer and then </v>

2381
01:40:31.540 --> 01:40:35.740
<v Speaker 3>upload them to my ipod.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to get on my phone and I </v>

2382
01:40:35.740 --> 01:40:36.800
<v Speaker 3>think of a song that I already have from</v>
<v Speaker 3>my old record collection.</v>

<v Speaker 4>for really poor college kids.</v>

2394
01:41:00.281 --> 01:41:02.980
<v Speaker 4>They do exactly that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they go to a website or they go to a</v>

2395
01:41:02.981 --> 01:41:06.040
<v Speaker 4>torrent bit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does or even where sites anymore.</v>

2396
01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:11.160
<v Speaker 4>Not really leaving an itunes yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They finally fucking.</v>

2397
01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:16.600
<v Speaker 4>Who are they?</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a couple of bands that still to </v>

2398
01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:16.990
<v Speaker 4>this day they will be.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just got on it recently.</v>

2399
01:41:17.830 --> 01:41:18.940
<v Speaker 4>Pink Floyd.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A couple of bands.</v>

2400
01:41:18.941 --> 01:41:20.320
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why I don't understand.</v>

2401
01:41:20.350 --> 01:41:21.550
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Weird.</v>

2402
01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:26.630
<v Speaker 4>You know those motherfuckers I set 1970,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so I just like,</v>

2403
01:41:26.890 --> 01:41:31.090
<v Speaker 4>like red band said when it's something </v>
<v Speaker 4>that you can download illegally,</v>

2404
01:41:31.091 --> 01:41:36.091
<v Speaker 4>like music or movies or anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it just sell it for as cheap as possible</v>

2405
01:41:37.541 --> 01:41:41.080
<v Speaker 4>so that you got to sell it so that it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>not worth going.</v>

2406
01:41:41.081 --> 01:41:45.000
<v Speaker 4>And what he did with Lucy gets.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this whole special for five bucks,</v>

2407
01:41:45.070 --> 01:41:46.090
<v Speaker 4>you'll get that money.</v>

2408
01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:50.680
<v Speaker 6>I will never spend $180 on a UFC,</v>
<v Speaker 6>you know,</v>

2409
01:41:50.681 --> 01:41:53.650
<v Speaker 6>a month.</v>
<v Speaker 6>But if I were to the option for 20 bucks</v>

2410
01:41:53.651 --> 01:41:54.460
<v Speaker 6>a month,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I got everything.</v>

2411
01:41:54.490 --> 01:41:56.870
<v Speaker 6>I would do it even if I never watched a </v>
<v Speaker 6>books militia.</v>

2412
01:41:57.350 --> 01:42:01.160
<v Speaker 6>Louis C dot K dot.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Well yeah,</v>

2413
01:42:01.180 --> 01:42:03.310
<v Speaker 6>but you're just used to.</v>
<v Speaker 6>People get a lot more people.</v>

2414
01:42:03.311 --> 01:42:06.810
<v Speaker 6>You're just so used to our pricing </v>
<v Speaker 6>structure that was created by boxing and</v>

2415
01:42:06.830 --> 01:42:09.400
<v Speaker 6>in like the eighties because the paper </v>
<v Speaker 6>view is so amazing.</v>

2416
01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:09.610
<v Speaker 6>Right?</v>

2417
01:42:10.140 --> 01:42:13.170
<v Speaker 4>What if you had any idea how much it </v>
<v Speaker 4>costs to put on a production,</v>

2418
01:42:13.171 --> 01:42:15.300
<v Speaker 4>you would understand why you didn't have</v>
<v Speaker 4>to charge so much.</v>

2419
01:42:15.540 --> 01:42:18.010
<v Speaker 4>It's ridiculous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but if you have 20 bucks no more.</v>

2420
01:42:18.330 --> 01:42:21.130
<v Speaker 4>No you wouldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You wouldn't sell enough to compensate?</v>

2421
01:42:21.210 --> 01:42:21.930
<v Speaker 4>I don't think so.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

2422
01:42:21.931 --> 01:42:26.931
<v Speaker 4>Louis CK did.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Joe Rogan was with the most brilliant </v>

2423
01:42:26.931 --> 01:42:26.931
<v Speaker 4>thing and can be done in 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

2424
01:42:26.931 --> 01:42:29.010
<v Speaker 4>he.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like anonymous.</v>

2425
01:42:29.011 --> 01:42:30.490
<v Speaker 4>He checked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Everybody checked.</v>

2426
01:42:30.510 --> 01:42:33.540
<v Speaker 4>The whole central got checked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I told got checked.</v>

2427
01:42:33.541 --> 01:42:38.541
<v Speaker 4>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm doing the same thing I'm working on </v>

2428
01:42:38.541 --> 01:42:40.320
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm thinking about doing an Atlanta in </v>

2429
01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:43.071
<v Speaker 4>April.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's what it gave it away for free or </v>

2430
01:42:43.071 --> 01:42:43.920
<v Speaker 4>something for a DVD.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But here's the beauty of it,</v>

2431
01:42:43.921 --> 01:42:45.180
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dope.</v>

2432
01:42:45.210 --> 01:42:50.210
<v Speaker 4>Everybody benefited on this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but nobody benefited as much as the </v>

2433
01:42:50.210 --> 01:42:50.430
<v Speaker 4>fans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Louis did it for his fame.</v>

2434
01:42:50.820 --> 01:42:52.140
<v Speaker 4>Five bucks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I found load.</v>

2435
01:42:52.141 --> 01:42:55.650
<v Speaker 4>Is that what it was for the actual hard </v>
<v Speaker 4>copy download?</v>

2436
01:42:55.980 --> 01:42:56.700
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's all you need.</v>

2437
01:42:56.810 --> 01:42:58.020
<v Speaker 4>That's all you leave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's it.</v>

2438
01:42:58.070 --> 01:42:58.910
<v Speaker 4>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it can download,</v>

2439
01:42:58.911 --> 01:43:03.911
<v Speaker 4>downloaded more than once.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Take it so cheap that they can't really </v>

2440
01:43:03.911 --> 01:43:03.911
<v Speaker 4>make out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was the.</v>

2441
01:43:04.290 --> 01:43:05.300
<v Speaker 4>It was a million dollars.</v>

2442
01:43:06.430 --> 01:43:08.500
<v Speaker 6>The idea of the UFC.</v>

01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:10.440

2445
01:43:10.590 --> 01:43:12.960
<v Speaker 4>It's not ready for $20 a month or two </v>
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

<v Speaker 4>remember we had this discussion the </v>

2631
01:51:19.051 --> 01:51:19.051
<v Speaker 4>other day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I read her sweater.</v>

2632
01:51:19.051 --> 01:51:19.990
<v Speaker 4>Staten Island was a fucking garbage </v>
<v Speaker 4>dump.</v>

2633
01:51:19.991 --> 01:51:21.080
<v Speaker 4>Brooke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>by the fucking Indians,</v>

2634
01:51:21.110 --> 01:51:23.080
<v Speaker 4>just really put the Indians.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They throw him out of New York.</v>

2635
01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:24.940
<v Speaker 4>Then they decided,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fuck,</v>

2636
01:51:24.941 --> 01:51:29.941
<v Speaker 4>we got this property over there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let's build on fucking staten island </v>

2637
01:51:29.941 --> 01:51:29.941
<v Speaker 4>with garbage.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Got Hill.</v>

2638
01:51:29.941 --> 01:51:30.370
<v Speaker 4>So it was all just garbage.</v>

2639
01:51:30.450 --> 01:51:33.460
<v Speaker 4>It used to half of it was a dump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why when you're driving Bro,</v>

2640
01:51:33.461 --> 01:51:36.530
<v Speaker 4>it's 20 minutes from Jersey.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That way that's when they give you.</v>

2641
01:51:36.890 --> 01:51:39.580
<v Speaker 4>Tell you what Staten Island to me wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>doing all.</v>

2642
01:51:39.581 --> 01:51:44.581
<v Speaker 4>Like when I used to do gigs in New York,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Staten Island had the most unfriendly </v>

2643
01:51:44.581 --> 01:51:45.550
<v Speaker 4>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was one club.</v>

2644
01:51:45.551 --> 01:51:47.950
<v Speaker 4>I'm standing on GRANDPA's.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was.</v>

2645
01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:51.880
<v Speaker 4>They wouldn't give you a seat for your </v>
<v Speaker 4>girlfriend.</v>

2646
01:51:52.090 --> 01:51:55.060
<v Speaker 4>You would show up with your girlfriend.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They would like to sit down in the back.</v>

2647
01:51:55.090 --> 01:51:58.330
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You see two for customers like wow,</v>

2648
01:51:58.390 --> 01:52:03.390
<v Speaker 4>like your performance,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like they don't even have like a little </v>

2649
01:52:03.390 --> 01:52:05.251
<v Speaker 4>site,</v>
<v Speaker 4>little spot where the performer can sit </v>

2650
01:52:05.251 --> 01:52:05.710
<v Speaker 4>down and your girlfriend can sit down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they would want you to,</v>

2651
01:52:06.080 --> 01:52:07.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>go stand outside.</v>

2652
01:52:07.871 --> 01:52:09.190
<v Speaker 4>Stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're not a part of the show.</v>

<v Speaker 4>got sick and tired to go to Harlem.</v>

2655
01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:19.800
<v Speaker 4>If they caught you weeded Harlem on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>way back from Jersey would confiscate </v>

2656
01:52:19.800 --> 01:52:22.300
<v Speaker 4>your car because you were interested in </v>
<v Speaker 4>transporting over federal lines.</v>

2657
01:52:22.950 --> 01:52:24.340
<v Speaker 4>Those bridges in that tunnel?</v>

2659
01:52:29.341 --> 01:52:29.341
<v Speaker 4>over,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your car gets confiscated.</v>

2660
01:52:29.970 --> 01:52:32.410
<v Speaker 4>It is in California,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's what happened there.</v>

2661
01:52:32.620 --> 01:52:37.620
<v Speaker 4>So they would wave.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So you had to go in through the George </v>

2662
01:52:37.620 --> 01:52:41.160
<v Speaker 4>Washington and come back to the Lincoln </v>
<v Speaker 4>tunnel after everyday you get sick of </v>

2663

<v Speaker 4>because he told Hollywood to suck his </v>

2739
01:55:43.020 --> 01:55:46.571
<v Speaker 4>dick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He went down to a lot of men suck his </v>

<v Speaker 4>he went down to mutiny on the bounty and</v>

2742
01:55:50.701 --> 01:55:51.780
<v Speaker 4>bought a fucking island.</v>

2743
01:55:51.840 --> 01:55:54.330
<v Speaker 4>Nobody's ever bought an island.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nobody's ever been that fucking quit.</v>

2744

2747
01:56:02.250 --> 01:56:04.290
<v Speaker 4>Every fucking killing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was Marlon Brando.</v>

01:57:38.170 --> 01:57:43.170
<v Speaker 2>they just found them a mushroom and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazon that eats indestructible </v>

<v Speaker 2>plastics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2791

01:57:45.900 --> 01:57:50.900
<v Speaker 4>So we're gonna throw a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 4>mushrooms on it and then the water's </v>

2793
01:57:50.900 --> 01:57:50.900
<v Speaker 4>going to be all trippy and we're all </v>

2799
01:58:09.570 --> 01:58:13.010
<v Speaker 2>Why do they ask the name of the stuff </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the Latin?</v>

2800
01:58:13.070 --> 01:58:13.970
<v Speaker 2>Let it go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bitch.</v>

2801
01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:15.920
<v Speaker 2>It's 2012,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2802
01:58:15.950 --> 01:58:17.720
<v Speaker 2>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plastic eating mushrooms,</v>

2803
01:58:17.780 --> 01:58:22.780
<v Speaker 2>that's the official name.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's spelled p e s t a l o t I o p s I s</v>

2804
01:58:26.570 --> 01:58:31.570
<v Speaker 2>micro s p o r a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's a resident of the Ecuadorian </v>

2805
01:58:33.100 --> 01:58:38.100
<v Speaker 2>rainforest and was discovered by a group</v>
<v Speaker 2>of student researchers led by molecular </v>

2806
01:58:38.100 --> 01:58:42.611
<v Speaker 2>biochemistry professor Scott Strobel as </v>
<v Speaker 2>a part of Yale's annual rainforest </v>

2807
01:58:42.611 --> 01:58:44.290
<v Speaker 2>expedition and laboratory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2808
01:58:44.291 --> 01:58:45.310
<v Speaker 2>they go down there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

2809
01:58:45.311 --> 01:58:50.311
<v Speaker 2>they have these scientists and these </v>
<v Speaker 2>researchers go down there and every now </v>

2810
01:58:50.311 --> 01:58:53.551
<v Speaker 2>and then they'll find some fucking crazy</v>
<v Speaker 2>shit that there's like all sorts of </v>

2811
01:58:53.551 --> 01:58:53.830
<v Speaker 2>medicines that have come out of the rain</v>
<v Speaker 2>forest,</v>

2812
01:58:53.980 --> 01:58:58.980
<v Speaker 2>incredible psychedelic drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of nutty fucking things in </v>

2813
01:58:58.980 --> 01:58:59.590
<v Speaker 2>that shoe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that bitch up every day.</v>

2814
01:58:59.620 --> 01:59:03.430
<v Speaker 2>So the mushroom like disintegrates the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the plastics or what's the,</v>

2815
01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:04.540
<v Speaker 2>do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eats it,</v>

2816
01:59:04.541 --> 01:59:08.030
<v Speaker 2>it's able to the fungus species will it </v>
<v Speaker 2>absorb,</v>

2817
01:59:08.060 --> 01:59:09.290
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms absorb things.</v>

2818
01:59:09.500 --> 01:59:09.840
<v Speaker 2>They,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

2819
01:59:09.960 --> 01:59:11.430
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really like they're,</v>

2820
01:59:11.520 --> 01:59:12.540
<v Speaker 2>they're the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2821
01:59:12.770 --> 01:59:17.770
<v Speaker 2>it's Karma.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like Karma free living the way </v>

2822
01:59:17.770 --> 01:59:17.770
<v Speaker 2>mushrooms live their speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They literally live in Shit.</v>

2823
01:59:17.980 --> 01:59:22.980
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they lived the most humble life </v>

2824
01:59:22.980 --> 01:59:22.980
<v Speaker 2>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there it's a living organism.</v>

2825
01:59:22.980 --> 01:59:24.760
<v Speaker 2>It's the first fungus species to able </v>
<v Speaker 2>to,</v>

2826
01:59:24.930 --> 01:59:28.510
<v Speaker 2>to be able to survive exclusively on </v>
<v Speaker 2>polyurethane.</v>

2827
01:59:29.140 --> 01:59:32.770
<v Speaker 2>So it lives on fucking indestructible </v>
<v Speaker 2>plastic.</v>

2828
01:59:32.890 --> 01:59:37.890
<v Speaker 2>And more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's able to do that in anaerobic </v>

2829
01:59:37.890 --> 01:59:37.960
<v Speaker 2>conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning the same conditions found in the</v>

2830
01:59:37.961 --> 01:59:42.961
<v Speaker 2>bottom of landfills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this makes this fungus a prime </v>

2831
01:59:42.961 --> 01:59:46.060
<v Speaker 2>candidate for bio read remediation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>remediation,</v>

2832
01:59:46.090 --> 01:59:51.090
<v Speaker 2>bio remediation projects that could </v>
<v Speaker 2>finally provide an alternative to just </v>

2833
01:59:51.090 --> 01:59:53.080
<v Speaker 2>burning plastic and hoping for the best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wonder how long that process takes.</v>

2834
01:59:53.080 --> 01:59:55.930
<v Speaker 2>Like are we talking about like 30 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>million years?</v>

2835
01:59:55.931 --> 01:59:58.090
<v Speaker 2>But at least it's better than what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>plans now.</v>

2836
01:59:58.230 --> 02:00:00.340
<v Speaker 2>Now they need to find some shit that a </v>
<v Speaker 2>nuclear waste.</v>

2837
02:00:01.310 --> 02:00:03.260
<v Speaker 2>It's probably in the Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's probably a frog.</v>

2838
02:00:03.280 --> 02:00:04.960
<v Speaker 2>Probably snookie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a frog.</v>

2839
02:00:04.961 --> 02:00:07.300
<v Speaker 2>They're going to give it this frog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's gonna eat nuclear waste.</v>

2840
02:00:07.301 --> 02:00:08.950
<v Speaker 2>And that's going to become fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>Godzilla.</v>

2841
02:00:09.850 --> 02:00:12.520
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There goes Tokyo.</v>

2842
02:00:12.570 --> 02:00:13.810
<v Speaker 2>Go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go Godzilla.</v>

2843
02:00:14.140 --> 02:00:16.960
<v Speaker 2>Danny proper goes to want to step up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the mic and to be on the podcast here.</v>

2844
02:00:16.961 --> 02:00:21.961
<v Speaker 2>Sign is our boy danny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've known Danny since he was a little </v>

2845
02:00:21.961 --> 02:00:25.561
<v Speaker 2>child since he was a small boy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now he's a black belt world </v>

2846
02:00:25.561 --> 02:00:26.680
<v Speaker 2>champion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First Tenth Planet Jujitsu,</v>

2847
02:00:26.681 --> 02:00:31.681
<v Speaker 2>black belts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The viewers have been looking at his </v>

2848
02:00:31.681 --> 02:00:31.910
<v Speaker 2>feet for the last two hours.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That phones headphones.</v>

2849
02:00:32.220 --> 02:00:37.220
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

<v Speaker 1>pushed.</v>

3013
02:07:20.690 --> 02:07:25.690
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Not mean people.</v>

3047
02:08:48.971 --> 02:08:50.260

<v Speaker 3>like so many of them,</v>

3048
02:08:50.290 --> 02:08:51.340
<v Speaker 3>like Brent,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 3>nice to everybody.</v>

3051
02:08:57.380 --> 02:08:59.650
<v Speaker 3>Check your fucking lights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The sport itself,</v>

3052
02:09:00.040 --> 02:09:00.880
<v Speaker 3>what it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

3053
02:09:00.970 --> 02:09:05.970
<v Speaker 3>what's going on?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What makes it so much fun is a filter </v>

3054
02:09:05.970 --> 02:09:07.320
<v Speaker 3>for douchebags because in the sport of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Jujitsu,</v>

3055
02:09:07.470 --> 02:09:09.490
<v Speaker 3>you're good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The sport is.</v>

3056
02:09:09.520 --> 02:09:12.940
<v Speaker 3>The game plan is to tap someone out to </v>
<v Speaker 3>put someone in a position,</v>

3057
02:09:13.090 --> 02:09:16.030
<v Speaker 3>in a choke hold or an arm bar.</v>
<v Speaker 3>None of it,</v>

3058
02:09:16.031 --> 02:09:17.230
<v Speaker 3>which I did.</v>
<v Speaker 3>None of it hurts.</v>

3059
02:09:17.231 --> 02:09:20.770
<v Speaker 3>You just tap out when you feel like you </v>
<v Speaker 3>can't get out and you tap out,</v>

3060
02:09:20.800 --> 02:09:21.730
<v Speaker 3>give up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then the guy,</v>

3061
02:09:21.731 --> 02:09:22.390
<v Speaker 3>let's go the whole.</v>

3062
02:09:22.390 --> 02:09:24.310
<v Speaker 3>So that's like a kill for you.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No one got hurt,</v>

3063
02:09:24.490 --> 02:09:29.490
<v Speaker 3>but you're tapped out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You couldn't get out if you douchebags </v>

3064
02:09:29.490 --> 02:09:31.480
<v Speaker 3>can't go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>can't walk through the fire.</v>

3065
02:09:31.481 --> 02:09:33.490
<v Speaker 3>Those beginning stages where they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting tapped out,</v>

3066
02:09:33.491 --> 02:09:36.670
<v Speaker 3>they're losing the game because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>take it too personally.</v>

3067
02:09:36.700 --> 02:09:40.480
<v Speaker 3>Everybody has an ego,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but Douche bags have the biggest egos so</v>

3068
02:09:40.481 --> 02:09:45.481
<v Speaker 3>they can't go into Jujitsu and and go </v>
<v Speaker 3>through the learning phases where </v>

3069
02:09:45.481 --> 02:09:47.650
<v Speaker 3>they're losing or they're tapping out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>losing a game of death.</v>

3070
02:09:47.950 --> 02:09:49.060
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can't handle it,</v>

3071
02:09:49.061 --> 02:09:54.061
<v Speaker 3>so they never even get to Jujitsu.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The only guys that make it through are </v>

3072
02:09:54.061 --> 02:09:57.841
<v Speaker 3>the guys that have a complete control of</v>
<v Speaker 3>their ego where they tap out at the </v>

3073
02:09:57.841 --> 02:09:58.240
<v Speaker 3>beginning all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're always losing in the beginning,</v>

3074
02:09:58.241 --> 02:09:59.920
<v Speaker 3>you're just tapping out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't hurt.</v>

3075
02:10:00.010 --> 02:10:05.010
<v Speaker 3>You're tapping out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but your ego can get bruised if you </v>

3076
02:10:05.010 --> 02:10:05.010
<v Speaker 3>don't have control of it.</v>

3077
02:10:05.080 --> 02:10:10.080
<v Speaker 3>So what ends up happening is Jujitsu is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is the ultimate douche bag filter.</v>

3078
02:10:10.091 --> 02:10:15.091
<v Speaker 3>You're left with a bunch of guys that </v>
<v Speaker 3>were had no problem tapping out and no </v>

3079
02:10:15.091 --> 02:10:19.651
<v Speaker 3>problem submitting,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no problem dealing with reality because </v>

3080
02:10:19.651 --> 02:10:21.490
<v Speaker 3>the reality is every dickhead wants to </v>
<v Speaker 3>think that he's the full command.</v>

3081
02:10:21.610 --> 02:10:23.020
<v Speaker 3>Every guy wants to think that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3082
02:10:23.021 --> 02:10:25.600
<v Speaker 3>there's so many guys,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like if I got into m and a,</v>

3083
02:10:25.780 --> 02:10:27.910
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you where it now I'm not </v>
<v Speaker 3>ended at MMA,</v>

3084
02:10:27.911 --> 02:10:30.490
<v Speaker 3>but if I get a new fucking be running </v>

<v Speaker 2>dudes are just natural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And those guys,</v>

3087
02:10:36.261 --> 02:10:41.261
<v Speaker 2>they can't handle Jujitsu because some </v>
<v Speaker 2>little cade dude will choke their </v>

3088

<v Speaker 2>fucking lights out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

3089
02:10:41.451 --> 02:10:46.451
<v Speaker 2>And that's also one of those guys are </v>
<v Speaker 2>scared of weed hollow as especially </v>

3090
02:10:46.451 --> 02:10:46.490
<v Speaker 2>edibles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>edibles.</v>

3091
02:10:46.491 --> 02:10:48.800
<v Speaker 2>Expose your douchey ness as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

3092
02:10:48.830 --> 02:10:51.330
<v Speaker 2>edibles are the best things to roll on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

3093
02:10:51.560 --> 02:10:55.000
<v Speaker 2>I don't like cookie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Realize you just never know how much thc</v>

3094
02:10:55.001 --> 02:11:00.001
<v Speaker 2>are getting into.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We talked about before with lately I've </v>

3095
02:11:00.231 --> 02:11:02.480
<v Speaker 2>been on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but on a good roll with these trips,</v>

3096
02:11:03.340 --> 02:11:06.460
<v Speaker 2>I decided a couple couple of pumps for </v>
<v Speaker 2>teaching.</v>

3097
02:11:07.000 --> 02:11:08.480
<v Speaker 2>I'm all good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't need to get crazy.</v>

3098
02:11:08.481 --> 02:11:10.850
<v Speaker 2>You guys ever tried the cold list?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

3099
02:11:10.980 --> 02:11:13.520
<v Speaker 2>Dot It's a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like a breath thing.</v>

3100
02:11:13.550 --> 02:11:14.930
<v Speaker 2>You tried it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was it.</v>

3101
02:11:15.120 --> 02:11:15.690
<v Speaker 2>Pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3102
02:11:15.990 --> 02:11:17.390
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's amazing.</v>

3103
02:11:17.570 --> 02:11:22.570
<v Speaker 2>But eventually they're gonna have like </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking filtration systems and air </v>

3104
02:11:22.570 --> 02:11:26.561
<v Speaker 2>conditioning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you come into you come into work </v>

3105
02:11:26.561 --> 02:11:26.561
<v Speaker 2>and just get high.</v>

3106
02:11:26.561 --> 02:11:26.561
<v Speaker 2>What about the new vapor pens?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does that.</v>

3107
02:11:26.561 --> 02:11:27.800
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the like old school.</v>

3108
02:11:27.801 --> 02:11:30.410
<v Speaker 2>Like they look like those magic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cigarette.</v>

3109
02:11:30.411 --> 02:11:31.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The cigarettes.</v>

3110
02:11:31.160 --> 02:11:32.210
<v Speaker 2>Electronic cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3111
02:11:32.240 --> 02:11:37.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're like soaked in thc and there's </v>

3112
02:11:37.240 --> 02:11:38.940
<v Speaker 2>zero smell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't just approach and talk about that </v>

3113
02:11:38.940 --> 02:11:40.040
<v Speaker 2>because someday you're gonna want to use</v>
<v Speaker 2>those in someplace.</v>

3114
02:11:40.610 --> 02:11:43.100
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile they're monitoring twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These cons.</v>

3115
02:11:43.130 --> 02:11:43.730
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We used to.</v>

3116
02:11:44.000 --> 02:11:48.380
<v Speaker 2>I used to have the electronic wines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they weren't accurate.</v>

3117
02:11:48.381 --> 02:11:49.460
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it seemed like you weren't.</v>

3118
02:11:49.461 --> 02:11:51.110
<v Speaker 2>You just suck on him for awhile and </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

3119
02:11:51.111 --> 02:11:52.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm not getting anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is bullshit.</v>

3120
02:11:52.771 --> 02:11:54.330
<v Speaker 2>It's eventually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all gonna.</v>

3121
02:11:54.331 --> 02:11:55.110
<v Speaker 2>Be Legal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're,</v>

3122
02:11:55.120 --> 02:11:56.660
<v Speaker 2>we're,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're battling at right now.</v>

3123
02:11:56.780 --> 02:11:59.090
<v Speaker 2>Here's some crazy shit that was on </v>
<v Speaker 2>MSNBC,</v>

3124
02:11:59.120 --> 02:12:03.050
<v Speaker 2>MSNBC DOT com.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's for royders in London.</v>

3125
02:12:03.080 --> 02:12:08.080
<v Speaker 2>These scientists did these studies on </v>
<v Speaker 2>people tripping on mash magic mushrooms </v>

3126
02:12:08.080 --> 02:12:11.860
<v Speaker 2>and they.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's given them the best picture yet of </v>

3127
02:12:11.860 --> 02:12:14.231
<v Speaker 2>how psychedelic drugs work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and these British scientists are saying </v>

3128
02:12:14.231 --> 02:12:16.220
<v Speaker 2>the findings suggest that such drugs </v>
<v Speaker 2>could be used to treat depression.</v>

3129
02:12:16.280 --> 02:12:17.270
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3130
02:12:17.271 --> 02:12:18.550
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is not.</v>

3131
02:12:18.650 --> 02:12:23.650
<v Speaker 2>This is all becoming mainstream shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One after the other over and over and </v>

3132
02:12:23.650 --> 02:12:24.230
<v Speaker 2>over again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's these studies that are coming to</v>

3133
02:12:24.231 --> 02:12:27.650
<v Speaker 2>light now that are suggesting that all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these different drugs,</v>

3134
02:12:27.800 --> 02:12:32.800
<v Speaker 2>ketamine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're seeing the ketamine can be used </v>

3135
02:12:32.800 --> 02:12:33.680
<v Speaker 2>as an instant cure for depression and </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons why kids get addicted</v>

3136
02:12:33.681 --> 02:12:38.681
<v Speaker 2>to ketamine is the first thing that </v>
<v Speaker 2>ketamine does alleviate all your </v>

3137
02:12:38.681 --> 02:12:41.381
<v Speaker 2>worries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like does one of the reasons why people </v>

3138
02:12:41.381 --> 02:12:43.691
<v Speaker 2>are doing it so that other suggesting </v>
<v Speaker 2>that ketamine can be used as some sort </v>

3139
02:12:43.691 --> 02:12:46.781
<v Speaker 2>of an antidepressant,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as some sort of an instant </v>

3140
02:12:46.781 --> 02:12:47.050
<v Speaker 2>antidepressant quality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well as suicide.</v>

3141
02:12:47.051 --> 02:12:49.640
<v Speaker 2>On two separate studies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the effects of Psilocybin,</v>

3142
02:12:49.641 --> 02:12:53.690
<v Speaker 2>the active ingredient in magic mushrooms</v>
<v Speaker 2>showed that contrary to scientists,</v>

3143
02:12:54.060 --> 02:12:57.830
<v Speaker 2>scientists expectations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which of course is based on propaganda.</v>

3144
02:12:58.010 --> 02:13:03.010
<v Speaker 2>It does not increase but rather suppress</v>
<v Speaker 2>activity in areas of the brain that are </v>

3145
02:13:03.010 --> 02:13:05.720
<v Speaker 2>also dampened with other antidepressant </v>
<v Speaker 2>treatments,</v>

3146
02:13:05.780 --> 02:13:10.780
<v Speaker 2>so they don't even understand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like they're saying psychedelics </v>

3147
02:13:10.780 --> 02:13:14.471
<v Speaker 2>are thought of as mind expanding drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's been assume that they work by </v>

3148
02:13:14.471 --> 02:13:15.680
<v Speaker 2>increasing the brain's activity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they don't.</v>

3149
02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:17.530
<v Speaker 2>Surprisingly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they found this.</v>

3150
02:13:17.730 --> 02:13:22.730
<v Speaker 2>Psilocybin actually causes the activity </v>
<v Speaker 2>to decrease in areas that have the </v>

3151
02:13:22.730 --> 02:13:24.150
<v Speaker 2>dentist connections with other areas so </v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't know.</v>

3152
02:13:24.770 --> 02:13:29.770
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it quiets your brain down so you </v>

3153
02:13:29.770 --> 02:13:31.260
<v Speaker 2>could have an outer body experience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That makes sense to me.</v>

3154
02:13:31.290 --> 02:13:31.630
<v Speaker 2>Sort of</v>

3155
02:13:32.010 --> 02:13:33.930
<v Speaker 3>less activity,</v>
<v Speaker 3>less activity.</v>

3156
02:13:34.050 --> 02:13:36.090
<v Speaker 3>Just like when you meditate,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you meditate,</v>

3157
02:13:36.380 --> 02:13:38.730
<v Speaker 3>you know people are addicted to </v>
<v Speaker 3>meditation because you know,</v>

3158
02:13:38.731 --> 02:13:40.210
<v Speaker 3>if you could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you could just think,</v>

3159
02:13:40.620 --> 02:13:43.290
<v Speaker 3>think about one thought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a water drop or whatever.</v>

3160
02:13:43.291 --> 02:13:44.960
<v Speaker 3>You get into that zone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People,</v>

3161
02:13:45.570 --> 02:13:48.660
<v Speaker 3>that zone is the frequency of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe.</v>

3162
02:13:48.661 --> 02:13:51.330
<v Speaker 3>That's where everyone's trying to get.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're trying to get that and you do it</v>

3163
02:13:51.331 --> 02:13:53.730
<v Speaker 3>by just thinking about one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so that makes sense.</v>

3164
02:13:53.731 --> 02:13:57.660
<v Speaker 3>You're quieting your brain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>removing all negativity.</v>

3165
02:13:57.750 --> 02:14:01.710
<v Speaker 3>You're thinking about one thing and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>aligns you with the universe.</v>

3166
02:14:01.711 --> 02:14:03.330
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe you know,</v>

3167
02:14:03.390 --> 02:14:05.130
<v Speaker 3>no one knows exactly what it's doing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3168
02:14:05.131 --> 02:14:08.250
<v Speaker 3>it might just be facilitating evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It might just be giving you a better way</v>

3169
02:14:08.251 --> 02:14:13.251
<v Speaker 3>of thinking because that's my hypothesis</v>
<v Speaker 3>because the free the universe is at one </v>

3170
02:14:13.251 --> 02:14:18.231
<v Speaker 3>frequency that science.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it makes sense that we should try to </v>

3171
02:14:18.231 --> 02:14:18.240
<v Speaker 3>get to that frequency.</v>

3172
02:14:18.240 --> 02:14:23.240
<v Speaker 3>If the universe is at a frequency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one frequency all throughout the </v>

3173
02:14:23.240 --> 02:14:23.240
<v Speaker 3>universe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know that.</v>

3174
02:14:23.240 --> 02:14:24.490
<v Speaker 3>It makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What do you mean by that?</v>

3175
02:14:24.540 --> 02:14:26.290
<v Speaker 3>What's his frequency?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're talking about it.</v>

3176
02:14:26.430 --> 02:14:29.760
<v Speaker 3>The whole universe is at a frequency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like one frequency,</v>

3177
02:14:29.761 --> 02:14:34.680
<v Speaker 3>and that was in the debate between a </v>
<v Speaker 3>creationism and evolution.</v>

3178
02:14:34.681 --> 02:14:35.910
<v Speaker 3>That was the strong point,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3179
02:14:35.911 --> 02:14:39.930
<v Speaker 3>There's a science proved that the whole </v>
<v Speaker 3>universe at one frequency.</v>

3180
02:14:40.050 --> 02:14:41.640
<v Speaker 3>So the creationists are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>see,</v>

3181
02:14:41.641 --> 02:14:44.100
<v Speaker 3>that's proof of God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's proof of intelligent design.</v>

3182
02:14:44.190 --> 02:14:49.190
<v Speaker 3>How could the whole universe by accident</v>
<v Speaker 3>be at one frequency frequency mean </v>

3183
02:14:49.351 --> 02:14:50.910
<v Speaker 3>though?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3184
02:14:51.090 --> 02:14:54.270
<v Speaker 3>I don't know exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's like the frequency.</v>

3185
02:14:54.590 --> 02:14:56.430
<v Speaker 3>What is the frequency of smoking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man?</v>

3186
02:14:56.790 --> 02:14:58.380
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that shit is so gross,</v>

3187
02:14:58.381 --> 02:14:59.640
<v Speaker 3>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>God Damn.</v>

3188
02:14:59.700 --> 02:15:03.060
<v Speaker 3>Or they put a fan on or something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the frequency is like,</v>

3189
02:15:03.061 --> 02:15:06.330
<v Speaker 3>like what's a frequency of vibration?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a vibration vibration.</v>

3190
02:15:06.540 --> 02:15:07.980
<v Speaker 3>Frequency of cigarettes give off.</v>

3191
02:15:09.030 --> 02:15:14.030
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's fucking calm for 93 point four </v>

3192
02:15:14.030 --> 02:15:17.480
<v Speaker 3>brands for real man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Unless you've got a window open or </v>

3193
02:15:17.480 --> 02:15:17.480
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you got to send a smoke sucker.</v>

3194
02:15:17.500 --> 02:15:18.970
<v Speaker 3>Shit ain't doing nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3195
02:15:19.440 --> 02:15:21.300
<v Speaker 3>Know what I mean by that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like what's a frequency?</v>

3196
02:15:21.301 --> 02:15:23.400
<v Speaker 3>And it like a radio station is a certain</v>
<v Speaker 3>frequency.</v>

3197
02:15:23.401 --> 02:15:25.620
<v Speaker 3>It's a 95 point five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What is that like?</v>

3198
02:15:25.790 --> 02:15:30.790
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what's a frequency and if you </v>

3199
02:15:30.790 --> 02:15:30.790
<v Speaker 3>turn that dial,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bam,</v>

3200
02:15:30.790 --> 02:15:32.040
<v Speaker 3>you need to get that frequency on 95 </v>
<v Speaker 3>point five.</v>

3201
02:15:32.041 --> 02:15:33.240
<v Speaker 3>If you were listening to Kayla.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

3202
02:15:33.390 --> 02:15:38.390
<v Speaker 3>So the pinnacle of science is that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>just discovered that the whole universe </v>

3203
02:15:39.210 --> 02:15:41.520
<v Speaker 3>is one frequency.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what number that is,</v>

3204
02:15:41.760 --> 02:15:46.760
<v Speaker 3>but it's a certain frequency in music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You got to be on the same frequency or </v>

3205
02:15:46.760 --> 02:15:49.260
<v Speaker 3>you got to be on frequencies that </v>
<v Speaker 3>harmonize with that frequency.</v>

3206
02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:51.000
<v Speaker 3>So it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like to me,</v>

3207
02:15:51.001 --> 02:15:53.100
<v Speaker 3>it makes sense that if the whole unit </v>
<v Speaker 3>so,</v>

3208
02:15:53.101 --> 02:15:54.480
<v Speaker 3>but,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the scientist saying,</v>

3209
02:15:54.690 --> 02:15:59.690
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't prove intelligent design </v>

3210
02:15:59.690 --> 02:16:01.881
<v Speaker 3>because we are finding that we're not in</v>
<v Speaker 3>just one universe where there's a </v>

3211
02:16:01.881 --> 02:16:01.881
<v Speaker 3>multiverse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

3212
02:16:01.920 --> 02:16:06.510
<v Speaker 3>there's endless universes that each one </v>
<v Speaker 3>is at a different frequency,</v>

3213
02:16:06.511 --> 02:16:08.550
<v Speaker 3>so that has improved any intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 3>design.</v>

3214
02:16:09.060 --> 02:16:10.800
<v Speaker 3>I don't really give a shit about that </v>
<v Speaker 3>argument,</v>

3215
02:16:10.920 --> 02:16:15.920
<v Speaker 3>but to me it makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're trying to get to add on the </v>

3216
02:16:15.920 --> 02:16:20.031
<v Speaker 3>frequency of the universe and that makes</v>
<v Speaker 3>sense to you because I have no idea </v>

3217
02:16:20.031 --> 02:16:21.870
<v Speaker 3>still and I'm like trying to get on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>radio station of the universe.</v>

3218
02:16:21.950 --> 02:16:24.410
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's another had meditation and Yoga.</v>

3219
02:16:24.450 --> 02:16:26.430
<v Speaker 3>This is my hypothesis is what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is what I'm.</v>

3220
02:16:26.610 --> 02:16:29.830
<v Speaker 3>This is my guess is that Yoga and </v>
<v Speaker 3>meditation,</v>

3221
02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:35.040
<v Speaker 3>unconditional love sex.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Certain drugs will get you in the </v>

3222
02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:38.530
<v Speaker 3>frequency if you love the man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about dog sex?</v>

3223
02:16:38.531 --> 02:16:40.710
<v Speaker 3>What about you fucking donkey?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's the same frequency.</v>

3224
02:16:40.711 --> 02:16:45.711
<v Speaker 3>Is it the same frequency animals?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm saying the only thing that I'm </v>

3225
02:16:45.711 --> 02:16:47.920
<v Speaker 3>seeing here is from God like </v>
<v Speaker 3>productions,</v>

3226
02:16:47.921 --> 02:16:50.500
<v Speaker 3>which right away you go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

3227
02:16:50.980 --> 02:16:52.450
<v Speaker 3>What they're saying is that all</v>

3228
02:16:52.530 --> 02:16:57.530
<v Speaker 1>beings in the universe connect through a</v>
<v Speaker 1>single frequency and there's a bunch of </v>

3229
02:16:57.530 --> 02:17:00.831
<v Speaker 1>videos I guess you have to watch to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand where they're trying to </v>

3230
02:17:00.831 --> 02:17:00.831
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

3231
02:17:00.831 --> 02:17:00.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>makes sense to me.</v>

3232
02:17:01.190 --> 02:17:05.870
<v Speaker 3>I looked tense and it says it's a song </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the butthole surfers.</v>

3233
02:17:05.960 --> 02:17:08.240
<v Speaker 3>Really bad.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a good song.</v>

3234
02:17:08.290 --> 02:17:11.390
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3235
02:17:11.600 --> 02:17:12.270
<v Speaker 3>no one knows what</v>

3236
02:17:12.290 --> 02:17:13.790
<v Speaker 1>the fuck is going on when you were on </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms.</v>

3237
02:17:13.791 --> 02:17:18.791
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly something that should be </v>

3238
02:17:18.791 --> 02:17:18.791
<v Speaker 1>studied though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what I think is missing in,</v>

3239
02:17:18.791 --> 02:17:18.791
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3240
02:17:18.791 --> 02:17:23.680
<v Speaker 1>and people's ideas of mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody's got this propaganda based </v>

3241
02:17:23.680 --> 02:17:24.710
<v Speaker 1>opinion on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody thinks it's bad for you.</v>

3242
02:17:24.711 --> 02:17:25.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

3243
02:17:25.151 --> 02:17:30.151
<v Speaker 1>I remember I had this conversation with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Michio Kaku wants when we're on the </v>

3244
02:17:30.151 --> 02:17:30.550
<v Speaker 1>opiod anthony show and I suggested a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3245
02:17:30.610 --> 02:17:32.690
<v Speaker 1>I asked him if he's ever done mushrooms </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

3246
02:17:32.691 --> 02:17:34.340
<v Speaker 1>he asked like I said like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

3247
02:17:34.341 --> 02:17:35.300
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ever,</v>

3248
02:17:35.390 --> 02:17:37.610
<v Speaker 1>you ever smoke crack?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever do math?</v>

3249
02:17:37.670 --> 02:17:38.210
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like,</v>

3250
02:17:38.500 --> 02:17:40.040
<v Speaker 1>to a lot of people that's like the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

3251
02:17:40.041 --> 02:17:41.990
<v Speaker 1>Like you say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do mushrooms and they don't want to mess</v>

3252
02:17:41.991 --> 02:17:44.240
<v Speaker 1>up their brain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so much insight,</v>

3253
02:17:44.241 --> 02:17:49.241
<v Speaker 1>so many different people have come up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with insights because directly related </v>

3254
02:17:49.241 --> 02:17:49.910
<v Speaker 1>to psychedelic experiments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know if it's true,</v>

3255
02:17:49.911 --> 02:17:52.820
<v Speaker 1>but the rumor was that Francis Crick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when he,</v>

3256
02:17:52.850 --> 02:17:57.850
<v Speaker 1>when he was dying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>admitted that he was a frequent user of </v>

3257
02:17:57.850 --> 02:17:59.360
<v Speaker 1>lsd and then that's how he came up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea,</v>

3258
02:17:59.370 --> 02:18:02.210
<v Speaker 1>the concept of the double helix of DNA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3259
02:18:02.211 --> 02:18:07.211
<v Speaker 1>that he came up with and under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence of the LSD has been an up a </v>

3260
02:18:07.211 --> 02:18:07.211
<v Speaker 1>bunch of this.</v>

3261
02:18:07.211 --> 02:18:11.560
<v Speaker 1>I think the guy's name was carrie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another guy came up with other insights </v>

3262
02:18:11.560 --> 02:18:14.951
<v Speaker 1>on LSD and it's been geneticists and </v>
<v Speaker 1>different people that have done Iowasca </v>

3263
02:18:14.951 --> 02:18:18.821
<v Speaker 1>that have had weird ideas and expand on </v>
<v Speaker 1>these ideas that came directly as a </v>

3264
02:18:18.821 --> 02:18:21.470
<v Speaker 1>result of psychedelic experiences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows what it is,</v>

3265
02:18:21.471 --> 02:18:22.520
<v Speaker 1>man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

3266
02:18:22.521 --> 02:18:24.740
<v Speaker 1>but it would be awesome if they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed people to fuck it,</v>

3267
02:18:24.741 --> 02:18:29.741
<v Speaker 1>study it instead of locked you in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking cage for experiencing something </v>

3268
02:18:29.741 --> 02:18:30.950
<v Speaker 1>that's been here a lot longer than </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have.</v>

3269
02:18:31.220 --> 02:18:32.570
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so stupid.</v>

3270
02:18:32.940 --> 02:18:34.910
<v Speaker 1>It's just we have a bunch of stupid </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

3271
02:18:35.060 --> 02:18:36.950
<v Speaker 1>like we were talking before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this happened about,</v>

3272
02:18:36.951 --> 02:18:39.860
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the presidential debates about watching,</v>

3273
02:18:40.210 --> 02:18:42.730
<v Speaker 3>like watching Newt Gingrich is </v>
<v Speaker 3>hilarious.</v>

3274
02:18:42.731 --> 02:18:46.900
<v Speaker 3>Like how is he even even in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>presidential race,</v>

3275
02:18:46.901 --> 02:18:51.901
<v Speaker 3>I mean that you're saying that guy </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't rob him and Mitt Romney are </v>

3276
02:18:52.211 --> 02:18:57.190
<v Speaker 3>arguing about because they both had an </v>
<v Speaker 3>investments in some,</v>

3277
02:18:57.250 --> 02:18:58.090
<v Speaker 3>some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3278
02:18:58.180 --> 02:19:02.680
<v Speaker 3>they both made money off the economy </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to shit based on their investments</v>

3279
02:19:03.190 --> 02:19:06.250
<v Speaker 3>and they both did,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there were arguing live on tv,</v>

3280
02:19:06.251 --> 02:19:11.251
<v Speaker 3>on CNN about who invested more and that </v>
<v Speaker 3>that alone should tell people that are </v>

3281
02:19:12.911 --> 02:19:14.990
<v Speaker 3>both full of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3282
02:19:15.130 --> 02:19:18.590
<v Speaker 3>he just lost the Kim and second place in</v>
<v Speaker 3>Florida new.</v>

3283
02:19:18.670 --> 02:19:20.740
<v Speaker 3>Can you imagine if Newt Gingrich's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the president,</v>

3284
02:19:21.100 --> 02:19:26.100
<v Speaker 3>Mitt Romney,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mitt Romney met with a kid who had </v>

3285
02:19:26.100 --> 02:19:27.950
<v Speaker 3>cerebral palsy and he marijuana</v>

3286
02:19:28.300 --> 02:19:30.980
<v Speaker 2>would say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you wouldn't even answer him.</v>

3287
02:19:31.010 --> 02:19:31.910
<v Speaker 2>He wouldn't even answer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said,</v>

3288
02:19:31.911 --> 02:19:32.600
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You put me in jail.</v>

3289
02:19:32.601 --> 02:19:33.080
<v Speaker 2>He said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

3290
02:19:33.110 --> 02:19:35.630
<v Speaker 2>you could try synthetic marijuana </v>
<v Speaker 2>synthetic.</v>

3291
02:19:35.631 --> 02:19:40.631
<v Speaker 2>Marilyn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was suggesting that that was a good </v>

3292
02:19:40.631 --> 02:19:41.720
<v Speaker 2>idea that I'm not for medical marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've told you I'm not for it.</v>

3293
02:19:41.900 --> 02:19:43.930
<v Speaker 2>Like you're not for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're telling for why,</v>

3294
02:19:43.931 --> 02:19:45.140
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>For what reason?</v>

3295
02:19:45.170 --> 02:19:46.190
<v Speaker 2>Under what reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

3296
02:19:46.191 --> 02:19:50.360
<v Speaker 2>Because you're a whore because all these</v>
<v Speaker 2>goddamn companies that gets you into the</v>

3297
02:19:50.361 --> 02:19:55.361
<v Speaker 2>position that you're in right now tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>you that that's the stance that you </v>

3298
02:19:55.361 --> 02:19:56.870
<v Speaker 2>should take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See that video of Mitt Romney's flipping</v>

3299
02:19:56.871 --> 02:20:00.860
<v Speaker 2>and flopping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an awesome a mormon man.</v>

3300
02:20:01.070 --> 02:20:02.990
<v Speaker 2>Not that there's anything wrong with </v>
<v Speaker 2>being a mormon,</v>

3301
02:20:02.991 --> 02:20:07.991
<v Speaker 2>but when you're a mormon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not allowed to run the </v>

3302
02:20:07.991 --> 02:20:07.991
<v Speaker 2>presidency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not around the run the country.</v>

3303
02:20:07.991 --> 02:20:12.221
<v Speaker 2>You're just not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're not allowed to any wacky </v>

3304
02:20:12.221 --> 02:20:12.221
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>

3305
02:20:12.221 --> 02:20:15.670
<v Speaker 2>If you're a super catholic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know jfk was a Catholic and </v>

3306
02:20:15.670 --> 02:20:15.670
<v Speaker 2>everything like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is with different times.</v>

3307
02:20:15.670 --> 02:20:17.630
<v Speaker 2>It's 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

3308
02:20:17.631 --> 02:20:19.400
<v Speaker 2>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you believe that Joseph Smith,</v>

3309
02:20:19.401 --> 02:20:23.510
<v Speaker 2>a 14 year old kid that lived in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 pound golden tablets that represented</v>

3310
02:20:23.511 --> 02:20:26.180
<v Speaker 2>the last work of Jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The guy was a con man,</v>

3311
02:20:26.181 --> 02:20:31.181
<v Speaker 2>unknown con man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said he found a stone and the secret </v>

3312
02:20:31.181 --> 02:20:33.560
<v Speaker 2>stone and he looked through the stone </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he could read the large works.</v>

3313
02:20:33.650 --> 02:20:37.070
<v Speaker 2>Jesus really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really come on,</v>

3314
02:20:37.071 --> 02:20:39.520
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was that in a goof ball.</v>

3315
02:20:40.840 --> 02:20:42.740
<v Speaker 2>It's just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just fucking amazing,</v>

3316
02:20:42.770 --> 02:20:43.430
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3317
02:20:43.431 --> 02:20:46.820
<v Speaker 2>I have friends that are friends of </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends actually that are Mormons that I</v>

3318
02:20:46.821 --> 02:20:48.080
<v Speaker 2>know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're very nice people.</v>

3319
02:20:48.081 --> 02:20:53.081
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the nicest religions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>what it gives them that's great is a </v>

3320
02:20:53.081 --> 02:20:57.131
<v Speaker 2>great sense of community like they have.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their churches have been a mormon </v>

3321
02:20:57.131 --> 02:20:57.131
<v Speaker 2>churches before.</v>

3322
02:20:57.131 --> 02:20:58.220
<v Speaker 2>They have a really nice sense of </v>
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>

3323
02:20:58.221 --> 02:21:01.730
<v Speaker 2>They're very nice to each other and they</v>
<v Speaker 2>really promote that they're promote like</v>

3324
02:21:01.850 --> 02:21:05.560
<v Speaker 2>that feeling of family and that positive</v>
<v Speaker 2>frequency and it does really.</v>

3325
02:21:05.600 --> 02:21:07.310
<v Speaker 2>It really makes a difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Man,</v>

3326
02:21:07.311 --> 02:21:08.090
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3327
02:21:08.091 --> 02:21:10.880
<v Speaker 2>I was at a mormon funeral recently and </v>
<v Speaker 2>these people,</v>

3328
02:21:10.881 --> 02:21:15.881
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they really believed that this guy was </v>

3329
02:21:15.881 --> 02:21:17.621
<v Speaker 2>in a better place and it really helped </v>
<v Speaker 2>them that their loved one had passed on </v>

3330
02:21:17.621 --> 02:21:18.650
<v Speaker 2>into a better place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really did and I and I,</v>

3331
02:21:18.651 --> 02:21:20.450
<v Speaker 2>I really support that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think that's awesome,</v>

3332
02:21:20.990 --> 02:21:25.990
<v Speaker 2>but just just that's just because the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideology happens to be in a good </v>

3333
02:21:25.990 --> 02:21:30.071
<v Speaker 2>frequency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you break down what the ideology </v>

3334
02:21:30.071 --> 02:21:30.071
<v Speaker 2>stands for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's ludicrous.</v>

3335
02:21:30.071 --> 02:21:31.700
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely doing some good for some</v>

3336
02:21:31.701 --> 02:21:34.670
<v Speaker 2>of these people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but so would just being nice,</v>

3337
02:21:34.850 --> 02:21:39.850
<v Speaker 2>it would do the exact same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we'll just being humble and giving </v>

3338
02:21:39.850 --> 02:21:39.940
<v Speaker 2>into love and just being nice to people.</v>

3339
02:21:40.080 --> 02:21:43.790
<v Speaker 2>You don't need some wacky shit that was </v>
<v Speaker 2>made by a con man,</v>

3340
02:21:43.791 --> 02:21:48.590
<v Speaker 2>a 14 year old con man who found golden </v>
<v Speaker 2>tablets and then when the people came to</v>

3341
02:21:48.591 --> 02:21:49.670
<v Speaker 2>him like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>where are these tablets?</v>

3342
02:21:49.671 --> 02:21:54.170
<v Speaker 2>He was older angels took them away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Angels took.</v>

3343
02:21:54.320 --> 02:21:55.670
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

3344
02:21:55.671 --> 02:21:57.830
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such a dumb story.</v>

3345
02:21:57.850 --> 02:21:59.760
<v Speaker 2>It's a terrible story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3346
02:22:00.260 --> 02:22:01.160
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to me,</v>

3347
02:22:01.161 --> 02:22:04.280
<v Speaker 2>I growing up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I despised all religions.</v>

3348
02:22:04.281 --> 02:22:08.960
<v Speaker 2>I thought I thought it was all just crap</v>
<v Speaker 2>and destroying society,</v>

3349
02:22:08.961 --> 02:22:11.240
<v Speaker 2>but as I get older,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

3350
02:22:11.450 --> 02:22:13.660
<v Speaker 2>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my opinion on religions,</v>

3351
02:22:13.760 --> 02:22:18.760
<v Speaker 2>if you do it right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's based on unconditional love and </v>

3352
02:22:18.760 --> 02:22:20.300
<v Speaker 2>doing the right thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different religions are just like.</v>

3353
02:22:20.580 --> 02:22:24.150
<v Speaker 2>It's a way to get your soul and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>right frequency.</v>

3354
02:22:24.300 --> 02:22:26.160
<v Speaker 2>There's different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Get your body physically,</v>

3355
02:22:26.160 --> 02:22:28.800
<v Speaker 3>like there's kettlebells and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>there's some people like to just run.</v>

3356
02:22:28.801 --> 02:22:33.801
<v Speaker 3>Some people like to swim,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all different ways to get your body </v>

3357
02:22:33.801 --> 02:22:34.290
<v Speaker 3>align,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I think all religions,</v>

3358
02:22:34.291 --> 02:22:37.070
<v Speaker 3>as long as you do it right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's Muslim or whatever,</v>

3359
02:22:37.080 --> 02:22:38.040
<v Speaker 3>cat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Catholicism,</v>

3360
02:22:38.041 --> 02:22:39.340
<v Speaker 3>like my grandma,</v>
<v Speaker 3>she did it right.</v>

3361
02:22:39.480 --> 02:22:43.920
<v Speaker 3>All she cared about was doing things for</v>
<v Speaker 3>others and she was hardcore Catholic.</v>

3362
02:22:43.921 --> 02:22:47.400
<v Speaker 3>Went to church every day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was per exercise of the soul.</v>

3363
02:22:47.670 --> 02:22:50.310
<v Speaker 3>That is what got her frequency in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>right place.</v>

3364
02:22:50.400 --> 02:22:53.250
<v Speaker 3>Some people do yoga,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some people meditate.</v>

3365
02:22:53.340 --> 02:22:55.170
<v Speaker 3>Some people you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>believe this.</v>

3366
02:22:55.171 --> 02:23:00.171
<v Speaker 3>Some people worship rocks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you really believe rock the rock is </v>

3367
02:23:00.171 --> 02:23:01.650
<v Speaker 3>the frequency of the universe and it </v>
<v Speaker 3>gets your soul in the right place.</v>

3368
02:23:01.940 --> 02:23:02.910
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm all for it.</v>

3369
02:23:03.600 --> 02:23:08.600
<v Speaker 2>It's an idea of just believing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>something and then having a code that </v>

3370
02:23:08.600 --> 02:23:12.630
<v Speaker 2>you live by and moving your life always </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a positive way,</v>

3371
02:23:12.950 --> 02:23:14.900
<v Speaker 2>and that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No matter what you call it.</v>

3372
02:23:14.901 --> 02:23:18.110
<v Speaker 2>What do you call it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hindu do you call it Kundalini Yoga,</v>

3373
02:23:18.111 --> 02:23:23.111
<v Speaker 2>where you call it Catholicism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're really moving in a positive </v>

3374
02:23:23.111 --> 02:23:27.011
<v Speaker 2>direction and you really believe in love</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you really are being warm and open </v>

3375
02:23:27.201 --> 02:23:32.201
<v Speaker 2>and you've given the idea of giving into</v>
<v Speaker 2>a higher power is not because God wants </v>

3376
02:23:32.201 --> 02:23:35.330
<v Speaker 2>you to be humble where God wants you to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be in all of his greatness.</v>

3377
02:23:35.440 --> 02:23:36.160
<v Speaker 2>What,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what it,</v>

3378
02:23:36.260 --> 02:23:38.450
<v Speaker 2>what it is is saying there's something </v>
<v Speaker 2>above you,</v>

3379
02:23:38.451 --> 02:23:43.451
<v Speaker 2>so not taking yourself so fucking </v>
<v Speaker 2>seriously and instead not being out for </v>

3380
02:23:43.451 --> 02:23:45.650
<v Speaker 2>number one and sort of realizing that we</v>
<v Speaker 2>are together.</v>

3381
02:23:45.651 --> 02:23:48.110
<v Speaker 2>Like there is a brotherhood and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sisterhood of man,</v>

3382
02:23:48.410 --> 02:23:48.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's,</v>

3383
02:23:48.981 --> 02:23:50.990
<v Speaker 2>that's really what it's supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>all about.</v>

3384
02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.960
<v Speaker 2>That's the good of religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's where I've seen religion help</v>

3385
02:23:53.961 --> 02:23:58.961
<v Speaker 2>people for sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was just like you growing up </v>

3386
02:23:58.961 --> 02:24:01.631
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it was both of us was the same </v>

3387
02:24:01.631 --> 02:24:01.760
<v Speaker 2>reason because we had seen the system </v>
<v Speaker 2>fail us.</v>

3388
02:24:02.000 --> 02:24:07.000
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had seen all these people that were </v>

3389
02:24:07.000 --> 02:24:08.711
<v Speaker 2>supposed to be correct and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people that were supposed to be </v>

3390
02:24:08.711 --> 02:24:08.711
<v Speaker 2>adults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We saw they were retarded.</v>

3391
02:24:08.711 --> 02:24:11.180
<v Speaker 2>We saw there were assholes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We saw that was all bullshit.</v>

3392
02:24:11.181 --> 02:24:11.880
<v Speaker 2>We saw that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3393
02:24:11.990 --> 02:24:16.990
<v Speaker 2>religion was being used negatively a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the time and it was a lot of guilt </v>

3394
02:24:16.990 --> 02:24:17.480
<v Speaker 2>and there was a lot of yelling at you </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it was a lot of.</v>

3395
02:24:17.540 --> 02:24:19.250
<v Speaker 2>So we just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we just trashed.</v>

3396
02:24:19.980 --> 02:24:20.150
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

3397
02:24:21.180 --> 02:24:22.380
<v Speaker 3>I like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would never,</v>

3398
02:24:22.440 --> 02:24:27.440
<v Speaker 3>if my grandmother was still alive,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would never try to like knock some </v>

3399
02:24:27.440 --> 02:24:31.010
<v Speaker 3>sense into her,</v>
<v Speaker 3>try to prove that the Bible is written </v>

3400
02:24:31.010 --> 02:24:31.010
<v Speaker 3>by Matt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It worked for her.</v>

3401
02:24:31.010 --> 02:24:33.330
<v Speaker 3>That was her kettlebells right there for</v>
<v Speaker 3>assault.</v>

3402
02:24:33.480 --> 02:24:35.190
<v Speaker 3>It worked for like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3403
02:24:35.460 --> 02:24:36.080
<v Speaker 3>and well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3404
02:24:36.090 --> 02:24:38.610
<v Speaker 3>that's the way I look at it now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think religion is,</v>

3405
02:24:38.900 --> 02:24:43.550
<v Speaker 3>is if you do it right in and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're,</v>

3406
02:24:43.560 --> 02:24:48.560
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you always look to do the right thing </v>

3407
02:24:48.560 --> 02:24:50.720
<v Speaker 3>and it's all life is all about a </v>
<v Speaker 3>selflessness and a unconditional.</v>

3408
02:24:53.210 --> 02:24:55.460
<v Speaker 2>And what people don't understand is that</v>
<v Speaker 2>benefits your man.</v>

3409
02:24:55.461 --> 02:24:56.420
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can be,</v>

3410
02:24:56.460 --> 02:24:58.850
<v Speaker 2>do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do that and do it in a selfish way.</v>

3411
02:24:58.970 --> 02:25:00.050
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sounds stupid,</v>

3412
02:25:00.051 --> 02:25:02.630
<v Speaker 2>but if you're a selfish person,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you really want to succeed.</v>

3413
02:25:02.631 --> 02:25:05.420
<v Speaker 2>You really want good things for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to do it selfishly,</v>

3414
02:25:05.780 --> 02:25:09.350
<v Speaker 2>be nice to everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the best way to get ahead.</v>

3415
02:25:09.530 --> 02:25:12.560
<v Speaker 2>The best way to get ahead is just be </v>
<v Speaker 2>nice to everybody.</v>

3416
02:25:12.561 --> 02:25:15.110
<v Speaker 2>Tip people whenever you can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tip more than you're supposed to.</v>

3417
02:25:15.111 --> 02:25:16.400
<v Speaker 2>Tip.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Give people hugs.</v>

<v Speaker 1>people give a shit about it.</v>

3553
02:30:33.370 --> 02:30:38.370
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should probably say something about </v>

3554
02:30:38.370 --> 02:30:38.370
<v Speaker 1>this fear factor thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3555
02:30:38.370 --> 02:30:38.370
<v Speaker 1>Fairfax had got pulled off the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3556
02:30:38.400 --> 02:30:43.400
<v Speaker 1>we weRe supposed to have a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an episode where contestants drank </v>

3557
02:30:43.400 --> 02:30:45.220
<v Speaker 1>donkey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>semen and a donkey urine.</v>

3558
02:30:45.440 --> 02:30:49.120
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently folks think it's too much.</v>

3559
02:30:50.170 --> 02:30:51.730
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3560
02:30:51.731 --> 02:30:53.590
<v Speaker 1>After we did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to be honest with you guys,</v>

3561
02:30:53.591 --> 02:30:57.230
<v Speaker 1>and I haven't told anybody this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think I got high with you after it</v>

3562
02:30:57.231 --> 02:30:58.420
<v Speaker 1>was over that day.</v>

3563
02:30:58.630 --> 02:31:00.520
<v Speaker 1>And I remember thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might haVe told you,</v>

3564
02:31:00.521 --> 02:31:01.750
<v Speaker 1>but I think we fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3565
02:31:01.751 --> 02:31:03.220
<v Speaker 1>I think we went too far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>

3566
02:31:03.550 --> 02:31:04.840
<v Speaker 1>it just seemed wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3567
02:31:04.841 --> 02:31:06.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people are not going to like,</v>

3568
02:31:06.160 --> 02:31:09.100
<v Speaker 1>this is gonna make people angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever.</v>

3569
02:31:09.101 --> 02:31:09.760
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody.</v>

3570
02:31:09.820 --> 02:31:14.820
<v Speaker 1>Somebody signed off on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then apparently the baCklash was </v>

3571
02:31:14.820 --> 02:31:15.790
<v Speaker 1>crazy and it shut down your thoughts all</v>
<v Speaker 1>together,</v>

3572
02:31:15.860 --> 02:31:16.990
<v Speaker 1>all the episode,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the episode.</v>

3573
02:31:17.140 --> 02:31:18.400
<v Speaker 1>and there's one episode that's gonna </v>
<v Speaker 1>air.</v>

3574
02:31:18.401 --> 02:31:23.401
<v Speaker 1>February is our next one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's one other two hour ePisode </v>

3575
02:31:23.401 --> 02:31:24.240
<v Speaker 1>that's gonna air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometime after that they haven't figured</v>

3576
02:31:24.241 --> 02:31:26.030
<v Speaker 1>out when I put it on the dvd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3577
02:31:26.031 --> 02:31:26.300
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

3578
02:31:26.301 --> 02:31:26.640
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

3579
02:31:26.910 --> 02:31:31.910
<v Speaker 1>I think it's never going to go anywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be buried and I'll never </v>

3580
02:31:31.910 --> 02:31:34.341
<v Speaker 1>do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they went too far showing throw </v>

3581
02:31:34.341 --> 02:31:36.000
<v Speaker 1>this shit and not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the stents are so much bigger now.</v>

3582
02:31:36.000 --> 02:31:39.210
<v Speaker 1>This show is so much bigger and crazier </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they tried to push everything.</v>

3583
02:31:39.480 --> 02:31:41.510
<v Speaker 1>I just think they went too far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was nutty,</v>

3584
02:31:41.700 --> 02:31:44.760
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think they went to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know exactly where there's.</v>

3585
02:31:44.761 --> 02:31:48.510
<v Speaker 1>Everybody has their own standards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just don't think that it's fair to ask</v>

3586
02:31:48.511 --> 02:31:50.820
<v Speaker 1>people to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds ridiculous coming from me.</v>

3587
02:31:50.910 --> 02:31:51.990
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to do it.</v>

3588
02:31:51.991 --> 02:31:54.180
<v Speaker 1>I know they don't have to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean to ask them to do it,</v>

3589
02:31:54.181 --> 02:31:56.640
<v Speaker 1>I think it would've been cool if </v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody said go fuck yourself.</v>

3590
02:31:56.641 --> 02:31:59.550
<v Speaker 1>And then we had like scrap stunt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would have been funny.</v>

3591
02:31:59.580 --> 02:32:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Have you had that happen yet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3592
02:32:00.961 --> 02:32:02.460
<v Speaker 1>but that would have been a good time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

3593
02:32:02.461 --> 02:32:03.210
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

3594
02:32:03.240 --> 02:32:08.240
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it was way easier for girls to </v>

3595
02:32:08.240 --> 02:32:08.240
<v Speaker 1>do that guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3596
02:32:08.240 --> 02:32:09.360
<v Speaker 1>obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean for real,</v>

3597
02:32:09.361 --> 02:32:11.120
<v Speaker 1>even girls were even joking around about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3598
02:32:11.120 --> 02:32:13.680
<v Speaker 1>It was way easier fitting it on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>chest and rubbing it in.</v>

3599
02:32:13.730 --> 02:32:15.050
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brian,</v>

3600
02:32:15.120 --> 02:32:17.430
<v Speaker 1>that's your world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you live in a dark world.</v>

3601
02:32:17.700 --> 02:32:18.840
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so look,</v>

3602
02:32:18.870 --> 02:32:23.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure if we had go back in time they </v>

3603
02:32:23.870 --> 02:32:26.991
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't do it again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the only way you find the limits of </v>

3604
02:32:26.991 --> 02:32:26.991
<v Speaker 1>these things is you push them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3605
02:32:27.730 --> 02:32:28.910
<v Speaker 1>I think it was a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oops.</v>

3606
02:32:29.010 --> 02:32:30.990
<v Speaker 1>So it's over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>

3607
02:32:31.050 --> 02:32:32.460
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would probably never see the light of</v>

3608
02:32:32.461 --> 02:32:37.461
<v Speaker 1>day or five years from now it'll air </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's no way they would have </v>

3609
02:32:37.461 --> 02:32:39.840
<v Speaker 1>considered doing it five years ago when </v>
<v Speaker 1>fear factor went through its first run.</v>

3610
02:32:39.841 --> 02:32:44.841
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in season one it was so tame and calm </v>

3611
02:32:44.841 --> 02:32:44.841
<v Speaker 1>and easy and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

3612
02:32:44.841 --> 02:32:49.520
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and small compared to what it's like </v>

3613
02:32:49.520 --> 02:32:49.520
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's just ridiculous.</v>

3614
02:32:49.520 --> 02:32:51.360
<v Speaker 1>The stumps are huge and crazy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>explosions and nuts.</v>

3615
02:32:51.750 --> 02:32:53.070
<v Speaker 1>Who knows if they'll ever show that </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

3616
02:32:53.130 --> 02:32:53.970
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3617
02:32:53.971 --> 02:32:58.971
<v Speaker 1>I'd rather than not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think people shouldn't have to do </v>

3618
02:32:58.971 --> 02:32:58.971
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's too much.</v>

3619
02:32:58.971 --> 02:32:58.971
<v Speaker 1>They fucked up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

3620
02:32:58.971 --> 02:33:03.710
<v Speaker 1>whatever we learn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kill the show kelly episode and we'll </v>

3621
02:33:03.710 --> 02:33:04.380
<v Speaker 1>march on because we got some good </v>
<v Speaker 1>episodes coming up.</v>

3622
02:33:04.410 --> 02:33:07.050
<v Speaker 1>It's a better way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a better show than it ever was before,</v>

3623
02:33:07.380 --> 02:33:12.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope this doesn't fuck it up for </v>

3624
02:33:12.380 --> 02:33:12.380
<v Speaker 1>everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uh,</v>

3625
02:33:12.380 --> 02:33:14.400
<v Speaker 1>I think everybody realizes that was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake including nbc and,</v>

3626
02:33:14.550 --> 02:33:17.080
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to push things and just,</v>

3627
02:33:17.100 --> 02:33:22.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't find out how bad things are </v>

3628
02:33:22.100 --> 02:33:22.100
<v Speaker 1>until you get people's reactions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the reaction.</v>

3629
02:33:22.100 --> 02:33:25.320
<v Speaker 1>Woopsies we're sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
