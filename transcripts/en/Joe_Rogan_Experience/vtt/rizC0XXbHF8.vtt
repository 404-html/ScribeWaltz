00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:02.890
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches,</v>

2
00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:04.031
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>

3
00:00:04.031 --> 00:00:07.210
<v Speaker 1>I just had a Twitter argument with Chelsea Clinton last night.</v>

4
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.790
<v Speaker 1>It's like these people don't understand,</v>

5
00:00:09.791 --> 00:00:12.860
<v Speaker 1>never respond to someone who's like way less than a year.</v>

6
00:00:12.861 --> 00:00:13.061
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

7
00:00:13.061 --> 00:00:13.510
<v Speaker 1>she like,</v>

8
00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:13.751
<v Speaker 1>she like,</v>

9
00:00:13.751 --> 00:00:14.920
<v Speaker 1>I called her basically,</v>

10
00:00:14.921 --> 00:00:16.750
<v Speaker 1>I called her parents war criminals and she was like,</v>

11
00:00:16.751 --> 00:00:16.991
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

12
00:00:16.991 --> 00:00:17.824
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

13
00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.160
<v Speaker 1>I should have listened more during,</v>

14
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.710
<v Speaker 1>during the 2003 war,</v>

15
00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:23.670
<v Speaker 1>Iraq war two,</v>

16
00:00:23.671 --> 00:00:24.730
<v Speaker 1>they antiwar activist,</v>

17
00:00:24.731 --> 00:00:25.111
<v Speaker 1>but she,</v>

18
00:00:25.111 --> 00:00:29.080
<v Speaker 1>she initially called people who were protesting the Afghanistan war and like the</v>

19
00:00:29.081 --> 00:00:30.580
<v Speaker 1>AUMF anti American.</v>

20
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.170
<v Speaker 1>And so she was like,</v>

21
00:00:32.171 --> 00:00:32.471
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

22
00:00:32.471 --> 00:00:36.340
<v Speaker 1>because there was a story that came out that said Chelsea Clinton actually with</v>

23
00:00:36.341 --> 00:00:40.910
<v Speaker 1>like American flags and all these things like when and disrupted an antiwar</v>

24
00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:43.360
<v Speaker 1>protest flat after nine 11.</v>

25
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.751
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

26
00:00:43.751 --> 00:00:46.290
<v Speaker 1>Like a group of like patriots including Cold Joshi,</v>

27
00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:49.480
<v Speaker 1>Quinn props like 22 or something.</v>

28
00:00:49.481 --> 00:00:49.691
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

29
00:00:49.691 --> 00:00:50.470
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

30
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.891
<v Speaker 1>maybe,</v>

31
00:00:50.891 --> 00:00:51.850
<v Speaker 1>maybe younger.</v>

32
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.901
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

33
00:00:52.901 --> 00:00:54.580
<v Speaker 1>so then people were calling her out and being like,</v>

34
00:00:54.581 --> 00:00:54.851
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

35
00:00:54.851 --> 00:00:56.050
<v Speaker 1>like mother like daughter,</v>

36
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.580
<v Speaker 1>cause there's stories of Hillary Clinton,</v>

37
00:00:57.581 --> 00:01:00.280
<v Speaker 1>like really working hard to quell the protest,</v>

38
00:01:00.281 --> 00:01:04.140
<v Speaker 1>the Vietnam war protests on campus and stuff as the president of the dump.</v>

39
00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:06.370
<v Speaker 1>The Republican Young Republicans club.</v>

40
00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.300
<v Speaker 1>She was the president.</v>

41
00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:08.310
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

42
00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

43
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.680
<v Speaker 1>It's just pre or post Kent state this.</v>

44
00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:12.310
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

45
00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.143
<v Speaker 1>good question.</v>

46
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:14.321
<v Speaker 1>Really good question.</v>

47
00:01:14.321 --> 00:01:14.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

48
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:15.543
<v Speaker 1>It was when the whole,</v>

49
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.390
<v Speaker 1>it'd be hard to defend it after that.</v>

50
00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:21.040
<v Speaker 1>Right after people are shot.</v>

51
00:01:21.041 --> 00:01:21.281
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

52
00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:22.810
<v Speaker 1>so Chelsea actually responded to me.</v>

53
00:01:22.811 --> 00:01:24.250
<v Speaker 1>I was floored because I was like,</v>

54
00:01:24.251 --> 00:01:28.810
<v Speaker 1>your dad killed 500,000 babies in Iraq with the sanctions and your mom voted for</v>

55
00:01:28.811 --> 00:01:29.471
<v Speaker 1>the Iraq war.</v>

56
00:01:29.471 --> 00:01:30.304
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

57
00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:31.420
<v Speaker 1>why don't you protest them?</v>

58
00:01:31.421 --> 00:01:31.931
<v Speaker 1>And she was like,</v>

59
00:01:31.931 --> 00:01:32.670
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

60
00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.011
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

61
00:01:33.011 --> 00:01:33.844
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

62
00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:35.523
<v Speaker 1>She just said,</v>

63
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:36.221
<v Speaker 1>she was like,</v>

64
00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:36.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

65
00:01:36.401 --> 00:01:37.091
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't really,</v>

66
00:01:37.091 --> 00:01:37.380
<v Speaker 1>she was,</v>

67
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.610
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that people protest in the Afghanistan war,</v>

68
00:01:39.611 --> 00:01:40.391
<v Speaker 1>anti American.</v>

69
00:01:40.391 --> 00:01:40.990
<v Speaker 1>And she was like,</v>

70
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.823
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

71
00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.690
<v Speaker 1>140 characters limiting.</v>

72
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.021
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

73
00:01:44.021 --> 00:01:46.360
<v Speaker 1>do you see that I just called your parents war criminals and you're actually</v>

74
00:01:46.361 --> 00:01:47.750
<v Speaker 1>responding to whatever,</v>

75
00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.660
<v Speaker 1>whatever WTF.</v>

76
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.940
<v Speaker 1>Just put the blinders on.</v>

77
00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:52.601
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

78
00:01:52.601 --> 00:01:53.231
<v Speaker 1>And then she was like,</v>

79
00:01:53.231 --> 00:01:57.460
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about the Americans who denounce like you know that America a an</v>

80
00:01:57.461 --> 00:01:58.810
<v Speaker 1>imperialist warmonger I was like,</v>

81
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.640
<v Speaker 1>it is the country's imperialist warmongering country that's killed millions of</v>

82
00:02:03.641 --> 00:02:04.031
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

83
00:02:04.031 --> 00:02:08.230
<v Speaker 1>You serve the democratic processes of dozens of countries and the world actually</v>

84
00:02:08.231 --> 00:02:10.240
<v Speaker 1>thinks that America is the number one threat to global peace.</v>

85
00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.280
<v Speaker 1>So I actually agree with the Americans.</v>

86
00:02:12.281 --> 00:02:13.300
<v Speaker 1>You denounce Chelsea,</v>

87
00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.553
<v Speaker 1>it was nuts.</v>

88
00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.480
<v Speaker 1>So that was a highlight of the day.</v>

89
00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

90
00:02:17.471 --> 00:02:18.790
<v Speaker 1>that's not a good look for her.</v>

91
00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:19.270
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

92
00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.160
<v Speaker 1>she should probably stay off Twitter for a few years.</v>

93
00:02:21.161 --> 00:02:21.411
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

94
00:02:21.411 --> 00:02:21.640
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>

95
00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.241
<v Speaker 1>it's like dude,</v>

96
00:02:22.241 --> 00:02:22.511
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>

97
00:02:22.511 --> 00:02:23.380
<v Speaker 1>just step back.</v>

98
00:02:23.381 --> 00:02:24.310
<v Speaker 1>I mean you sound awful.</v>

99
00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:26.180
<v Speaker 1>I know that you're trying to get in the public spotlight and,</v>

100
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.850
<v Speaker 1>and get that momentum behind you.</v>

101
00:02:27.851 --> 00:02:30.770
<v Speaker 1>I mean people are already talking about her running in 2020 yeah.</v>

102
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:31.750
<v Speaker 1>Michelle Obama.</v>

103
00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:32.770
<v Speaker 1>Chelsea Clinton.</v>

104
00:02:32.771 --> 00:02:33.604
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

105
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.040
<v Speaker 2>You imagine what they are finding is that there's like two parts of our</v>

106
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:43.840
<v Speaker 2>operating brain,</v>

107
00:02:43.841 --> 00:02:47.560
<v Speaker 2>and this is going to be me paring it down,</v>

108
00:02:47.561 --> 00:02:50.200
<v Speaker 2>but one is the analytical thinking,</v>

109
00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:51.160
<v Speaker 2>deciding thing.</v>

110
00:02:51.161 --> 00:02:53.680
<v Speaker 2>And the other is this social awareness sprain,</v>

111
00:02:53.681 --> 00:02:58.681
<v Speaker 2>which is always like always checking in on how am I in relation to others.</v>

112
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.300
<v Speaker 2>It's also the part of that brain that actually we can,</v>

113
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.931
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

114
00:03:01.931 --> 00:03:04.150
<v Speaker 2>like the metacognitive part and the part that I can,</v>

115
00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.620
<v Speaker 2>they call it mind reading,</v>

116
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:06.341
<v Speaker 2>but really it's just,</v>

117
00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:08.110
<v Speaker 2>it's just by US sitting here,</v>

118
00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:11.290
<v Speaker 2>I can kind of get a sense of how you feel and what you're thinking right.</v>

119
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:12.590
<v Speaker 2>Just by the,</v>

120
00:03:12.591 --> 00:03:14.380
<v Speaker 2>the connection that we have and just,</v>

121
00:03:14.381 --> 00:03:15.460
<v Speaker 2>it's part of who we are.</v>

122
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.160
<v Speaker 2>So when our analytical brain is offline,</v>

123
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:18.760
<v Speaker 2>this other one,</v>

124
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.860
<v Speaker 2>the social one pops on immediately.</v>

125
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:21.211
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

126
00:03:21.211 --> 00:03:26.211
<v Speaker 2>so what they're theorizing is that that is like the fundamental need for humans</v>

127
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:33.061
<v Speaker 2>in safety and survival is how are we relating to each other as a,</v>

128
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.943
<v Speaker 2>as a group.</v>

129
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.320
<v Speaker 2>But it makes sense if you look,</v>

130
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.090
<v Speaker 2>I mean to me it makes sense in,</v>

131
00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.953
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

132
00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.441
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

133
00:03:38.441 --> 00:03:39.580
<v Speaker 2>we are social animals.</v>

134
00:03:39.581 --> 00:03:40.331
<v Speaker 2>We forget that,</v>

135
00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:40.661
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

136
00:03:40.661 --> 00:03:44.680
<v Speaker 2>but you look at other species of monkeys or wolves or whatever,</v>

137
00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:46.360
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

138
00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.691
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

139
00:03:46.691 --> 00:03:49.750
<v Speaker 2>there might be a period of time where say,</v>

140
00:03:49.751 --> 00:03:49.991
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

141
00:03:49.991 --> 00:03:53.170
<v Speaker 2>a wolf will will get kicked out of a pack for awhile and he'll go do his thing,</v>

142
00:03:53.171 --> 00:03:54.820
<v Speaker 2>but eventually come back to a pack.</v>

143
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.900
<v Speaker 2>It's not safe for us as humans and animals,</v>

144
00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.450
<v Speaker 2>social animals like these to be isolated.</v>

145
00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.660
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

146
00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:02.380
<v Speaker 2>it's not.</v>

147
00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.840
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

148
00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.110
<v Speaker 2>and so there's all these parts of us that just,</v>

149
00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.080
<v Speaker 2>if we're not connected to other people in a,</v>

150
00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:09.550
<v Speaker 2>in a very direct and true way,</v>

151
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.790
<v Speaker 2>there's these sort of a deep down,</v>

152
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.800
<v Speaker 2>emotional and physiological,</v>

153
00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:16.180
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

154
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.440
<v Speaker 2>fears that come up,</v>

155
00:04:17.441 --> 00:04:18.130
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

156
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.431
<v Speaker 2>And they,</v>

157
00:04:18.431 --> 00:04:19.390
<v Speaker 2>and they're the real,</v>

158
00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.160
<v Speaker 2>and that's what the neurobiology is showing,</v>

159
00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:22.520
<v Speaker 2>which is really an interesting and mean.</v>

160
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.770
<v Speaker 2>We can just think about that,</v>

161
00:04:23.771 --> 00:04:27.340
<v Speaker 2>but they're actually showing it now that if we're not really connected to each</v>

162
00:04:27.341 --> 00:04:28.090
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>

163
00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.110
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be freaked out.</v>

164
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.340
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to be okay.</v>

165
00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:31.150
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

166
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.983
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

167
00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.501
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

168
00:04:32.501 --> 00:04:36.970
<v Speaker 2>I really believe that this really drives a lot of the internal struggle we have.</v>

169
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:38.103
<v Speaker 2>And we're really,</v>

170
00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.990
<v Speaker 2>and this is part of,</v>

171
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.250
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

172
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.811
<v Speaker 2>getting into it,</v>

173
00:04:39.811 --> 00:04:40.644
<v Speaker 2>but that's part of my,</v>

174
00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.670
<v Speaker 2>what I'm trying to bring into the world and my platform now is,</v>

175
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.560
<v Speaker 2>is just to,</v>

176
00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.240
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

177
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.991
<v Speaker 2>stand up and say,</v>

178
00:04:46.991 --> 00:04:47.530
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

179
00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:49.390
<v Speaker 2>we need each other and we can do it.</v>

180
00:04:49.391 --> 00:04:50.224
<v Speaker 2>It's not,</v>

181
00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.120
<v Speaker 2>and for guys specifically,</v>

182
00:04:52.121 --> 00:04:52.301
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

183
00:04:52.301 --> 00:04:57.301
<v Speaker 2>It's such a social stigma of ours to not be real or open or connected or</v>

184
00:04:57.461 --> 00:04:58.570
<v Speaker 2>vulnerable with guys.</v>

185
00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.553
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

186
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.331
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

187
00:05:01.331 --> 00:05:01.870
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

188
00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.990
<v Speaker 2>it's cool to see the science coming out because it's,</v>

189
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.690
<v Speaker 2>I've all this anecdotal evidence of being out the woods in the woods with kids</v>

190
00:05:07.691 --> 00:05:08.850
<v Speaker 2>or being in a,</v>

191
00:05:08.851 --> 00:05:12.010
<v Speaker 2>in a management with guys are running a retreat or whatever this is of how</v>

192
00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:17.011
<v Speaker 2>powerful it is to like set down all of our differences and just be there.</v>

193
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.430
<v Speaker 2>But now the science is really lightened it up and yeah,</v>

194
00:05:21.431 --> 00:05:21.760
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

195
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.241
<v Speaker 2>loneliest.</v>

196
00:05:22.241 --> 00:05:22.481
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

197
00:05:22.481 --> 00:05:24.430
<v Speaker 2>we can all think about a loneliness isn't fun.</v>

198
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:25.510
<v Speaker 2>It's not a,</v>

199
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.560
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't feel good.</v>

200
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:27.430
<v Speaker 2>But the other,</v>

201
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.430
<v Speaker 2>this is crazy too that they're showing that emotional pain lights up the same</v>

202
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.600
<v Speaker 2>centers of our brain.</v>

203
00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:35.920
<v Speaker 2>It's physical pain.</v>

204
00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.530
<v Speaker 2>And that the one study showed that,</v>

205
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.443
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

206
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.520
<v Speaker 2>an insult to someone had much more painful and longterm effects than slamming</v>

207
00:05:45.551 --> 00:05:46.630
<v Speaker 2>somebody with a hammer,</v>

208
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:47.770
<v Speaker 2>hitting their hand with a hammer.</v>

209
00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:53.070
<v Speaker 2>So like our emotional pain literally actually exists in the body.</v>

210
00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:58.530
<v Speaker 2>Like it is actual pain and the reason that it's so uncomfortable</v>

211
00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.840
<v Speaker 3>to feel our emotions,</v>

212
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:00.681
<v Speaker 3>which it is,</v>

213
00:06:00.681 --> 00:06:01.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

214
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.440
<v Speaker 3>I mean I'll just say it is,</v>

215
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.960
<v Speaker 3>is that it actually hurts like actually hurts.</v>

216
00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:09.890
<v Speaker 3>I mean and there's like people say things like you broke my heart or I'm dying</v>

217
00:06:09.891 --> 00:06:11.000
<v Speaker 3>of heart ache or whatever,</v>

218
00:06:11.001 --> 00:06:15.080
<v Speaker 3>but the science is catching up and showing us that this pain is actual,</v>

219
00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:16.123
<v Speaker 3>it's real.</v>

220
00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:16.730
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

221
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.310
<v Speaker 3>I know you're really interested in this and I am too.</v>

222
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.330
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>

223
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.230
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

224
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.970
<v Speaker 3>there are some misconceptions and that,</v>

225
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.580
<v Speaker 3>well I shouldn't say their misconceptions.</v>

226
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.670
<v Speaker 3>I would say that there's a distortion of what's going on.</v>

227
00:06:28.671 --> 00:06:30.590
<v Speaker 3>And this is not to say it's,</v>

228
00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.230
<v Speaker 3>it's actually to say that it's worse than you think it is.</v>

229
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:38.480
<v Speaker 3>So what most people who are outside of academia think is going on is not quite</v>

230
00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:39.314
<v Speaker 3>what's going on.</v>

231
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.730
<v Speaker 3>We think it's something worse.</v>

232
00:06:40.731 --> 00:06:40.831
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

233
00:06:40.831 --> 00:06:41.121
<v Speaker 3>I know,</v>

234
00:06:41.121 --> 00:06:43.240
<v Speaker 3>cause I've heard you and lots and lots of other people talk about it.</v>

235
00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.380
<v Speaker 3>And it's not your fault at all because you're not there and all you do is get</v>

236
00:06:45.381 --> 00:06:46.460
<v Speaker 3>the media reports about it.</v>

237
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:47.990
<v Speaker 3>So I think what most people,</v>

238
00:06:47.991 --> 00:06:51.470
<v Speaker 3>I get it from Gad sad and Jordan Peterson or professors,</v>

239
00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.760
<v Speaker 3>they end day.</v>

240
00:06:52.761 --> 00:06:53.600
<v Speaker 3>If you listen to them,</v>

241
00:06:53.601 --> 00:06:54.350
<v Speaker 3>actually they will,</v>

242
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.981
<v Speaker 3>they themselves,</v>

243
00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:56.180
<v Speaker 3>we'll talk about it a little differently,</v>

244
00:06:56.181 --> 00:06:57.590
<v Speaker 3>but people still consume it differently.</v>

245
00:06:57.591 --> 00:07:02.591
<v Speaker 3>Cause the news right is all about the crazy thing that the 18 year old said</v>

246
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:05.720
<v Speaker 3>right at Wesleyan or whatever or the not the 18 year old,</v>

247
00:07:05.721 --> 00:07:08.780
<v Speaker 3>it's the 45 year olds and then sometimes the 45 year old.</v>

248
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:09.230
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

249
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.441
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

250
00:07:09.441 --> 00:07:09.951
<v Speaker 3>But here's the,</v>

251
00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:13.730
<v Speaker 3>so that stuff that really sort of loony stuff,</v>

252
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:14.031
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

253
00:07:14.031 --> 00:07:16.480
<v Speaker 3>that you hear coming out or um,</v>

254
00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:17.271
<v Speaker 3>protests,</v>

255
00:07:17.271 --> 00:07:17.571
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

256
00:07:17.571 --> 00:07:21.950
<v Speaker 3>people saying that they are going to die because you said a word.</v>

257
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:23.240
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

258
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.140
<v Speaker 3>that happens.</v>

259
00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:24.581
<v Speaker 3>It does.</v>

260
00:07:24.581 --> 00:07:25.340
<v Speaker 3>It's all true.</v>

261
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:25.910
<v Speaker 3>It's all there.</v>

262
00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:26.690
<v Speaker 3>I've seen it,</v>

263
00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:31.690
<v Speaker 3>but I've seen it maybe at most one time a year in the colleges where I've been.</v>

264
00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.490
<v Speaker 3>Maybe not even less than that.</v>

265
00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:35.353
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

266
00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:36.800
<v Speaker 3>What is,</v>

267
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:38.210
<v Speaker 3>and if it were just that,</v>

268
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.770
<v Speaker 3>that's not actually a big deal.</v>

269
00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:41.270
<v Speaker 3>It's much worse than that.</v>

270
00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:41.840
<v Speaker 3>What's,</v>

271
00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:46.840
<v Speaker 3>what's worse is that if there is a self censorship going on that's universal and</v>

272
00:07:49.431 --> 00:07:50.330
<v Speaker 3>profound,</v>

273
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:51.403
<v Speaker 3>constant,</v>

274
00:07:51.650 --> 00:07:52.490
<v Speaker 3>omnipresent.</v>

275
00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:54.440
<v Speaker 3>Like for instance,</v>

276
00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:55.340
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

277
00:07:55.340 --> 00:08:00.320
<v Speaker 3>I never talk about my love for boxing around academics or I'm very careful if I</v>

278
00:08:00.321 --> 00:08:01.010
<v Speaker 3>do,</v>

279
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:01.821
<v Speaker 3>but it's not even that.</v>

280
00:08:01.821 --> 00:08:04.760
<v Speaker 3>It's that we know that there are certain things that can't be set on a college</v>

281
00:08:04.761 --> 00:08:06.800
<v Speaker 3>campus and so we just don't say them.</v>

282
00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.070
<v Speaker 3>Therefore there's no need to police us.</v>

283
00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:13.250
<v Speaker 3>There's no need to yell at us and scream at us and protest.</v>

284
00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:17.450
<v Speaker 3>And what's the motivation for the for which are the people that are holding back</v>

285
00:08:17.451 --> 00:08:20.540
<v Speaker 3>on thoughts that maybe they would normally express because they don't?</v>

286
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:20.691
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

287
00:08:20.691 --> 00:08:23.750
<v Speaker 3>here's what I think it is for the senior faculty who have tenure,</v>

288
00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.370
<v Speaker 3>meaning lifetime appointments,</v>

289
00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:26.653
<v Speaker 3>cowardice.</v>

290
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:28.483
<v Speaker 3>That's all it is.</v>

291
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:29.570
<v Speaker 3>I think they're cowards.</v>

292
00:08:29.630 --> 00:08:30.200
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

293
00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:35.200
<v Speaker 3>If you are an adjunct like me with no job security or if you're an assistant</v>

294
00:08:35.271 --> 00:08:37.520
<v Speaker 3>professor up for tenure and if you don't get tenure,</v>

295
00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:38.450
<v Speaker 3>you have no career.</v>

296
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:39.620
<v Speaker 3>I don't blame them.</v>

297
00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:40.130
<v Speaker 3>I get it.</v>

298
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:40.970
<v Speaker 3>That's what I've done too.</v>

299
00:08:40.971 --> 00:08:43.610
<v Speaker 3>I police myself cause you have to to stay in the game.</v>

300
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.200
<v Speaker 3>If you have tenure,</v>

301
00:08:45.590 --> 00:08:46.490
<v Speaker 3>lifetime appointment,</v>

302
00:08:46.491 --> 00:08:47.420
<v Speaker 3>your senior professor,</v>

303
00:08:47.421 --> 00:08:49.370
<v Speaker 3>you make the decisions there on curriculum,</v>

304
00:08:49.371 --> 00:08:50.870
<v Speaker 3>hiring and firing and tenure.</v>

305
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:55.900
<v Speaker 3>The faculty make those decisions and you don't challenge these crazy ideas in</v>

306
00:08:57.091 --> 00:08:57.570
<v Speaker 3>any way.</v>

307
00:08:57.570 --> 00:08:58.620
<v Speaker 3>Or if you police yourself,</v>

308
00:08:58.621 --> 00:09:00.090
<v Speaker 3>you stop yourself from saying things that you,</v>

309
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:02.070
<v Speaker 3>you think are right that you believe in.</v>

310
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:04.230
<v Speaker 3>You're a coward.</v>

311
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:04.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

312
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.000
<v Speaker 3>Those people are cowards.</v>

313
00:09:06.001 --> 00:09:06.760
<v Speaker 3>I've seen it.</v>

314
00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.760
<v Speaker 3>It's just overrun by cowards.</v>

315
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:09.480
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

316
00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.111
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

317
00:09:10.111 --> 00:09:10.350
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

318
00:09:10.350 --> 00:09:10.501
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

319
00:09:10.501 --> 00:09:11.160
<v Speaker 3>I mean this,</v>

320
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:12.270
<v Speaker 3>they are very though.</v>

321
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:13.380
<v Speaker 3>So here's the thing,</v>

322
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:14.520
<v Speaker 3>I can't prove this.</v>

323
00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:15.101
<v Speaker 3>This is just so,</v>

324
00:09:15.101 --> 00:09:16.020
<v Speaker 3>I'm just saying this is,</v>

325
00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:17.340
<v Speaker 3>this is my belief,</v>

326
00:09:17.370 --> 00:09:20.160
<v Speaker 3>but I think it's pretty well informed cause I've been around these people a long</v>

327
00:09:20.161 --> 00:09:22.830
<v Speaker 3>time and in part I share this the,</v>

328
00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:27.860
<v Speaker 3>I think the worst fear of all those people is being called a racist or a sexist</v>

329
00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:30.263
<v Speaker 3>publicly.</v>

330
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:34.680
<v Speaker 3>I think that is their version of being in a cave,</v>

331
00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.770
<v Speaker 3>crawling on their bellies in the pitch black.</v>

332
00:09:37.800 --> 00:09:39.180
<v Speaker 3>I think that's their worst fear.</v>

333
00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:46.850
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible]</v>

334
00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:49.000
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
