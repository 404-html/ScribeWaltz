00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.770
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buffer.</v>

8
00:00:23.771 --> 00:00:26.390
<v Speaker 1>A little drawn out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a little buffer in there.</v>

9
00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.970
<v Speaker 1>It's time that dude blew his knee out</v>
<v Speaker 1>once doing that.</v>

10
00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.090
<v Speaker 1>He blew his acl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how much he explodes and do that</v>

11
00:00:37.091 --> 00:00:38.800
<v Speaker 1>jump when he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's done.</v>

12
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.660
<v Speaker 1>I'm not bullshitting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he do it live?</v>

13
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:41.950
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

14
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.800
<v Speaker 1>He popped his fucking acl.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ow.</v>

15
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.531
<v Speaker 1>Ow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

16
00:00:44.531 --> 00:00:46.370
<v Speaker 1>Did he fall or did he just kind of like</v>
<v Speaker 1>catches,</v>

17
00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.780
<v Speaker 1>walked it off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>walked it off and then got surgery.</v>

18
00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.771
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

19
00:00:50.771 --> 00:00:54.970
<v Speaker 1>and he had to be like ginger on it for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>while cause he should do crazy shit man.</v>

20
00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.520
<v Speaker 1>You know when you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you filmed them doing the buffer,</v>

21
00:00:57.521 --> 00:01:01.030
<v Speaker 1>three 60 a lot of people forgot about</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

22
00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.160
<v Speaker 1>He's a madman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That guy.</v>

23
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.650
<v Speaker 1>Did He,</v>

24
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.470
<v Speaker 2>do you remember what UFC it was 100?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

25
00:01:06.471 --> 00:01:07.710
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it,</v>

26
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.580
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if he had to do it like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

27
00:01:10.581 --> 00:01:14.210
<v Speaker 2>after he tore it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like he had to go back on in the ring on</v>

28
00:01:14.211 --> 00:01:15.050
<v Speaker 2>a torn acl.</v>

29
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.750
<v Speaker 1>I think if he did it wasn't for very</v>
<v Speaker 1>long.</v>

30
00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:20.790
<v Speaker 1>I think he just went ahead and got it</v>
<v Speaker 1>fixed real quick.</v>

31
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.290
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

32
00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.200
<v Speaker 1>cause if you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get your acl fixed and they'll give</v>

33
00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:27.570
<v Speaker 1>you like these um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty,</v>

34
00:01:27.571 --> 00:01:29.970
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lightweight carbon fiber braces,</v>

35
00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:32.010
<v Speaker 1>you could walk around in it like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

36
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.540
<v Speaker 1>like it's not cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's not,</v>

37
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.520
<v Speaker 1>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to go long distances,</v>

38
00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:39.690
<v Speaker 1>but they can kind of brace you up pretty</v>
<v Speaker 1>good with a minimal brace.</v>

39
00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.360
<v Speaker 1>Postsurgery you just gotta be real</v>
<v Speaker 1>careful with it.</v>

40
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.920
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't want to hurt it again.</v>

41
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.620
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I hurt my knee recently,</v>

42
00:01:45.621 --> 00:01:49.730
<v Speaker 2>I had to go to cvs and get like one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those knee things for my knee and had to</v>

43
00:01:49.731 --> 00:01:52.670
<v Speaker 2>buy like a cane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so I have all these like neat to how</v>

44
00:01:52.671 --> 00:01:55.340
<v Speaker 2>bad you hurt your knee pretty bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I couldn't walk on it to the point where</v>

45
00:01:55.341 --> 00:01:57.590
<v Speaker 2>I bought it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cane the same name that you had problems</v>

46
00:01:57.591 --> 00:01:59.540
<v Speaker 2>with.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What was your original problem with it?</v>

47
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.960
<v Speaker 2>I have this problem where my knee pops</v>
<v Speaker 2>out of place and like it for like a week</v>

48
00:02:05.031 --> 00:02:07.400
<v Speaker 2>or so I could almost not even walk on</v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

49
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.020
<v Speaker 2>It pops back in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

50
00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:12.470
<v Speaker 2>It's only happened a few times but it</v>
<v Speaker 2>happened to recently and it was so bad</v>

51
00:02:12.471 --> 00:02:14.750
<v Speaker 2>that I couldn't walk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had to go to see him.</v>

52
00:02:14.751 --> 00:02:18.440
<v Speaker 2>When you go to cvs to buy a cane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the canes or like feminine,</v>

53
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.650
<v Speaker 2>like there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they all have glitter on them like a old</v>

54
00:02:21.651 --> 00:02:23.600
<v Speaker 2>man came that's gray or something?</v>

55
00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.030
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all like sparkly blue,</v>

56
00:02:26.031 --> 00:02:27.790
<v Speaker 2>sparkly Kane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think that is?</v>

57
00:02:27.791 --> 00:02:30.380
<v Speaker 2>Is that a marketing move?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is there like a lot of ladies that are</v>

58
00:02:30.381 --> 00:02:31.510
<v Speaker 2>hurting themselves?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

59
00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.630
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's just so old.</v>

60
00:02:32.631 --> 00:02:33.950
<v Speaker 2>People can see it like they're like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

61
00:02:33.951 --> 00:02:37.100
<v Speaker 2>a sparkly canes or I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess when you get old you don't care</v>

62
00:02:37.101 --> 00:02:38.570
<v Speaker 2>about if it's sparkly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe.</v>

63
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't know how you can see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have no idea.</v>

64
00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.010
<v Speaker 2>It was weird.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hurting your knees is not good man.</v>

65
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.680
<v Speaker 2>It's not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I constantly think about it too</v>

66
00:02:48.681 --> 00:02:50.690
<v Speaker 2>because it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it always happens when I'm just like</v>

67
00:02:50.691 --> 00:02:53.330
<v Speaker 2>doing something mild like all turned to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the side,</v>

68
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.760
<v Speaker 2>but I'll pivot on it or something that</v>
<v Speaker 2>just pops out.</v>

69
00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 2>You probably have at the very least like</v>
<v Speaker 2>something with your meniscus.</v>

70
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 3>It could be like a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I used to have this thing called a</v>

71
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:05.950
<v Speaker 3>bucket handle tear and a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what it would be is,</v>

72
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.400
<v Speaker 3>you know how like a bucket handle like</v>
<v Speaker 3>flip over,</v>

73
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:10.630
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one way or the other.</v>

74
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.870
<v Speaker 3>Well it gets stuck like flipped like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>piece tears and then it gets stuck like</v>

75
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:19.630
<v Speaker 3>wedged up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's terrible.</v>

76
00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:20.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>

77
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.850
<v Speaker 3>I had that where it was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was bad for a while,</v>

78
00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.390
<v Speaker 3>which is kind of give out on me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then one day in Jujitsu class,</v>

79
00:03:28.391 --> 00:03:31.930
<v Speaker 3>it just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it just got wrapped up the wrong way.</v>

80
00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:35.590
<v Speaker 3>Like upside down.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like my leg got to get yanked in some</v>

81
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:37.390
<v Speaker 3>way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My leg completely locked up.</v>

82
00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.020
<v Speaker 3>It was brutal,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it was a pretty quick fix.</v>

83
00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.360
<v Speaker 3>It's a way easier fix than a nacl</v>
<v Speaker 3>because with an acl they have to replace</v>

84
00:03:46.361 --> 00:03:48.610
<v Speaker 3>your ligament and it takes a long time</v>
<v Speaker 3>to heal.</v>

85
00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:51.010
<v Speaker 3>But with the meniscus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like six weeks later you can do Jujitsu</v>

86
00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.963
<v Speaker 3>again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

87
00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.010
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My old roommate had this thing where</v>

88
00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.060
<v Speaker 3>like his,</v>
<v Speaker 3>his,</v>

89
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.190
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shoulder would always pop out of place</v>

90
00:03:57.191 --> 00:03:58.120
<v Speaker 3>and he'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my God,</v>

91
00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:59.920
<v Speaker 3>oh out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then he would have to like hit it</v>

92
00:03:59.921 --> 00:04:03.680
<v Speaker 3>against a wall to pop it back in like</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mel Gibson and lethal weapon and style.</v>

93
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.830
<v Speaker 3>Exactly like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's not good.</v>

94
00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.050
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

95
00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.450
<v Speaker 3>See like stuff like that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can fix that.</v>

96
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:11.830
<v Speaker 3>You should get that fixed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

97
00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't talk to anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that surgery suck sucks.</v>

98
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.270
<v Speaker 3>It's all the rehab.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

99
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.930
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People that have a serious shoulder</v>

100
00:04:19.931 --> 00:04:24.550
<v Speaker 3>surgery or a pretty universal in saying</v>
<v Speaker 3>it sucks depending upon how badly fuck</v>

101
00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:25.384
<v Speaker 3>it up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like,</v>

102
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.490
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like a guy like Cain Velasquez,</v>

103
00:04:27.491 --> 00:04:30.070
<v Speaker 3>he's had it and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he came back from it,</v>

104
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.980
<v Speaker 3>but it took a long ass time before he</v>
<v Speaker 3>was fighting again.</v>

105
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.300
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those,</v>

106
00:04:34.301 --> 00:04:36.200
<v Speaker 3>those are bad surgeries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

107
00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.680
<v Speaker 3>And the knee one though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

108
00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.240
<v Speaker 3>they might be able to just trim that</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit like you should find out what it is</v>

109
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.700
<v Speaker 3>because if it's just a meniscus tear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

110
00:04:45.701 --> 00:04:47.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd go in there,</v>

111
00:04:47.081 --> 00:04:51.820
<v Speaker 3>they scope it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if it's not that aggressive,</v>

112
00:04:51.821 --> 00:04:53.770
<v Speaker 3>it's not a gigantic tear,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll,</v>

113
00:04:53.771 --> 00:04:56.050
<v Speaker 3>you'll be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's only happened like three or four</v>

114
00:04:56.051 --> 00:04:59.260
<v Speaker 3>times my whole life,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it's like I'm 41 it's fine if it</v>

115
00:04:59.261 --> 00:05:01.090
<v Speaker 3>happens as long as you just don't move</v>
<v Speaker 3>along.</v>

116
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.140
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

117
00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.710
<v Speaker 3>Kitchen in 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sedentary lifestyle seminar.</v>

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.553
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Terry,</v>

119
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.880
<v Speaker 3>are you still doing your losing weight</v>
<v Speaker 3>thing?</v>

120
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.900
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just did my first month finished my</v>

121
00:05:10.901 --> 00:05:15.901
<v Speaker 3>first month that it was 17.3 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it was incredible in one month.</v>

122
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.500
<v Speaker 3>That's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

123
00:05:17.501 --> 00:05:18.640
<v Speaker 3>it's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But then I think,</v>

124
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:21.640
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still have a 23 pounds.</v>

125
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.940
<v Speaker 3>Don't think like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Think that you're committed.</v>

126
00:05:24.941 --> 00:05:25.990
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

127
00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:27.070
<v Speaker 3>That's a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

128
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.760
<v Speaker 3>that's a very impressive accomplishment.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's hard to do.</v>

129
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.830
<v Speaker 3>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I Miss Bread so much though.</v>

130
00:05:32.831 --> 00:05:37.240
<v Speaker 3>I haven't had any breads since then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't had any like cheese or</v>

131
00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.370
<v Speaker 3>anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I almost snapped the other day.</v>

132
00:05:39.371 --> 00:05:40.990
<v Speaker 3>I was just so hungry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

133
00:05:40.991 --> 00:05:43.180
<v Speaker 3>I just can't eat chicken or vegetables</v>
<v Speaker 3>anymore.</v>

134
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.410
<v Speaker 3>Well this is what it's like.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like as you get older,</v>

135
00:05:47.411 --> 00:05:51.010
<v Speaker 3>your body just sucks more and more a</v>
<v Speaker 3>processing,</v>

136
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.250
<v Speaker 3>the kind of food you love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your body is like dude,</v>

137
00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.150
<v Speaker 3>enough with the fucking split getty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jesus Christ.</v>

138
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.600
<v Speaker 3>It's just like glue.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just it tastes so good though.</v>

139
00:06:03.601 --> 00:06:04.341
<v Speaker 3>Oh God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

140
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:05.870
<v Speaker 3>It's good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One thing I noticed though,</v>

141
00:06:05.871 --> 00:06:09.260
<v Speaker 3>immediately all my acid reflex gone,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like all that,</v>

142
00:06:09.261 --> 00:06:13.640
<v Speaker 3>like burping and,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and just like stomach acid completely</v>

143
00:06:13.641 --> 00:06:14.290
<v Speaker 3>gone from that.</v>

144
00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.300
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's the cheese or if</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's the bread or Dotson.</v>

145
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.340
<v Speaker 3>That's fascinating man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

146
00:06:20.341 --> 00:06:25.040
<v Speaker 3>and we had this guy on Mark Sisson the</v>
<v Speaker 3>other day and he's the author of the</v>

147
00:06:25.041 --> 00:06:27.590
<v Speaker 3>primal blueprint and he was talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

148
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:31.160
<v Speaker 3>he had irritable bowel syndrome,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which whenever I hear that,</v>

149
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.740
<v Speaker 3>I don't even know want to know what that</v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

150
00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.840
<v Speaker 3>I feel like I have that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What does it mean?</v>

151
00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:37.101
<v Speaker 3>It means like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

152
00:06:37.101 --> 00:06:40.940
<v Speaker 3>ibs gets shitty.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You get diarrhea all the way all the</v>

153
00:06:40.941 --> 00:06:41.780
<v Speaker 3>time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all day.</v>

154
00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.790
<v Speaker 3>I usually have that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but that's from drinking.</v>

155
00:06:43.791 --> 00:06:45.080
<v Speaker 3>That's not ibs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's just</v>

156
00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.330
<v Speaker 3>making its way through your veins,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the evil alcohol.</v>

157
00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:51.350
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

158
00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:52.730
<v Speaker 3>Well he told me that he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

159
00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.270
<v Speaker 3>he cured it all by just eliminating</v>
<v Speaker 3>grains.</v>

160
00:06:57.410 --> 00:07:00.530
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't take in very many,</v>

161
00:07:00.531 --> 00:07:02.660
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>carbohydrates at all.</v>

162
00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.110
<v Speaker 3>Like he doesn't do any breads or pastas</v>
<v Speaker 3>or things like that.</v>

163
00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:08.300
<v Speaker 3>Most of it comes from,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

164
00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:11.600
<v Speaker 3>from fruits and vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mostly vegetables.</v>

165
00:07:11.601 --> 00:07:14.300
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And meet like he was,</v>

166
00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.560
<v Speaker 3>it was essentially saying that he had</v>
<v Speaker 3>all these issues and obviously what</v>

167
00:07:18.561 --> 00:07:22.130
<v Speaker 3>works for one person might not nit</v>
<v Speaker 3>necessarily even be as good for another</v>

168
00:07:22.131 --> 00:07:24.560
<v Speaker 3>person.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They say that there's different styles</v>

169
00:07:24.561 --> 00:07:26.120
<v Speaker 3>of human,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

170
00:07:26.121 --> 00:07:29.300
<v Speaker 3>that people who are your ancestors come</v>
<v Speaker 3>from specific backgrounds.</v>

171
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.250
<v Speaker 3>Your diet is going to be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

172
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:34.580
<v Speaker 3>some I should find out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's bullshit though.</v>

173
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.390
<v Speaker 3>Cause you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've heard that before that that always</v>

174
00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:40.400
<v Speaker 3>seemed like bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know.</v>

175
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.300
<v Speaker 3>You know what that was like a recent</v>
<v Speaker 3>study they were talking about it that</v>

176
00:07:44.301 --> 00:07:45.340
<v Speaker 3>there was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

177
00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:48.260
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to eat like your DNA.</v>

178
00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.280
<v Speaker 3>You know what I'm talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember that thing you would like your</v>

179
00:07:52.281 --> 00:07:54.200
<v Speaker 3>genetic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

180
00:07:54.290 --> 00:07:59.270
<v Speaker 3>they were trying to like say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh you're a specific type and that type</v>

181
00:07:59.271 --> 00:08:00.350
<v Speaker 3>needs a lot of red meat.</v>

182
00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.910
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're this type,</v>

183
00:08:01.911 --> 00:08:04.450
<v Speaker 3>that type of needs a lot of carbs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like that makes sense.</v>

184
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.440
<v Speaker 3>Getting some kind of like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

185
00:08:06.441 --> 00:08:10.610
<v Speaker 3>scan of your body of what your body</v>
<v Speaker 3>needs or lacks or needs more of than</v>

186
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:12.740
<v Speaker 3>other people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It just makes sense.</v>

187
00:08:12.741 --> 00:08:13.280
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

188
00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.260
<v Speaker 3>totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Especially if you're,</v>

189
00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:20.180
<v Speaker 3>your body's like developed like your</v>
<v Speaker 3>ancestors developed in an area where</v>

190
00:08:20.181 --> 00:08:23.690
<v Speaker 3>they needed specific types of foods.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The ancestral diet,</v>

191
00:08:23.691 --> 00:08:25.190
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Should you eat?</v>

192
00:08:25.191 --> 00:08:29.180
<v Speaker 3>Look your ancestors is that it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pretty recently?</v>

193
00:08:29.181 --> 00:08:33.350
<v Speaker 3>This was just at the nlf but I think is</v>
<v Speaker 3>this saying that there's more than one</v>

194
00:08:33.351 --> 00:08:36.860
<v Speaker 3>type of person,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the more than one type of diet?</v>

195
00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:39.830
<v Speaker 3>I think this is just talking about a</v>
<v Speaker 3>specific ancient diet.</v>

196
00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:41.900
<v Speaker 3>That's what I think this is.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cause,</v>

197
00:08:41.901 --> 00:08:44.360
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what the ancestral diet</v>
<v Speaker 3>ideas,</v>

198
00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:50.090
<v Speaker 3>the idea mark sisson guy was talking</v>
<v Speaker 3>about,</v>

199
00:08:50.091 --> 00:08:53.060
<v Speaker 3>that's really fascinating to me is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

200
00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:56.130
<v Speaker 3>when you're taking in all these carbs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're taking in a lot</v>

201
00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:01.130
<v Speaker 1>of sugar and that when you eliminate</v>
<v Speaker 1>sugar and a eliminate inflammatory</v>

202
00:09:01.741 --> 00:09:03.540
<v Speaker 1>foods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are,</v>

203
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.570
<v Speaker 1>your body operates more efficiently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just healthier.</v>

204
00:09:06.571 --> 00:09:09.480
<v Speaker 1>It has more resources to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

205
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.410
<v Speaker 1>fight off illness and inflammation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>

206
00:09:13.411 --> 00:09:17.850
<v Speaker 1>It's a fascinating concept.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think might not work for everybody.</v>

207
00:09:17.851 --> 00:09:19.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck do I know,</v>

208
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:20.910
<v Speaker 1>but I'm going to give it a shot for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>little while.</v>

209
00:09:20.911 --> 00:09:21.750
<v Speaker 1>I'm gonna see what it's like.</v>

210
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:23.220
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty interesting because I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

211
00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:24.840
<v Speaker 2>my,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my diet went from,</v>

212
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:27.330
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Mcdonald's to Wendy's everyday to</v>

213
00:09:27.331 --> 00:09:30.990
<v Speaker 2>pizza every day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I really had the worst diet ever</v>

214
00:09:30.991 --> 00:09:35.991
<v Speaker 2>and now it's just tons of vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a little protein and I don't feel tired</v>

215
00:09:36.361 --> 00:09:39.060
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I feel like I can feel the food work</v>

216
00:09:39.061 --> 00:09:39.930
<v Speaker 2>almost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

217
00:09:39.931 --> 00:09:43.530
<v Speaker 2>it's interesting how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how just changing your diet from just</v>

218
00:09:43.531 --> 00:09:45.600
<v Speaker 2>crap too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's super healthy.</v>

219
00:09:45.601 --> 00:09:48.480
<v Speaker 2>How,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much you can feel it immediately</v>

220
00:09:48.481 --> 00:09:49.580
<v Speaker 2>almost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

221
00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:51.090
<v Speaker 2>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

222
00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:54.360
<v Speaker 2>And working out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's getting the doorframes.</v>

223
00:09:54.390 --> 00:09:58.350
<v Speaker 2>I've never had that in my life where</v>
<v Speaker 2>like where I like two hours later I'd be</v>

224
00:09:58.351 --> 00:09:59.610
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why am I so happy?</v>

225
00:09:59.611 --> 00:10:01.140
<v Speaker 2>Like I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like bouncing around.</v>

226
00:10:01.141 --> 00:10:02.460
<v Speaker 2>Ha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never felt that before.</v>

227
00:10:02.461 --> 00:10:03.271
<v Speaker 2>I've worked out,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for,</v>

228
00:10:03.271 --> 00:10:05.790
<v Speaker 2>I've never felt that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for some reason this time around,</v>

229
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:06.750
<v Speaker 2>I'm just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

230
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:08.430
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy for no reason.</v>

231
00:10:08.431 --> 00:10:09.960
<v Speaker 2>I'm happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird,</v>

232
00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:12.210
<v Speaker 2>they've sent it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've done studies that show that</v>

233
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:15.780
<v Speaker 2>depression can be cured just as easily</v>

<v Speaker 1>then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

238
00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:23.960
<v Speaker 1>they were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were comparing it to people that</v>

239
00:10:23.961 --> 00:10:25.870
<v Speaker 1>got on an Ssri and they were saying</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>

240
00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.920
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty similar results and a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people,</v>

241
00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:30.560
<v Speaker 1>people that really started doing a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of cardio,</v>

242
00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.800
<v Speaker 1>doing a lot of running and things along</v>
<v Speaker 1>those lines.</v>

243
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:38.390
<v Speaker 1>Like that's like something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to be specifically good like</v>

244
00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:40.760
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you need kind of like both kinds of</v>

245
00:10:40.761 --> 00:10:44.000
<v Speaker 1>things for your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need like some kind of strenuous</v>

246
00:10:44.001 --> 00:10:46.490
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's body weight stuff,</v>

247
00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:50.870
<v Speaker 1>pushups or something like that or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that just really gets your,</v>

248
00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.840
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your strength going and then you need</v>

249
00:10:53.841 --> 00:10:55.790
<v Speaker 1>some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that's just cardiovascular.</v>

250
00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:57.920
<v Speaker 1>And when you do those things together,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

251
00:10:57.921 --> 00:11:00.020
<v Speaker 1>it's just you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your body's relaxes.</v>

252
00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:02.240
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more,</v>

253
00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:06.440
<v Speaker 1>it's more um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adaptable.</v>

254
00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:08.510
<v Speaker 1>It's more just loose.</v>

255
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:12.390
<v Speaker 2>Do you have it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is your bedroom completely blacked out?</v>

256
00:11:12.391 --> 00:11:15.540
<v Speaker 2>Like dark and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you wake up is you see</v>

257
00:11:15.541 --> 00:11:17.940
<v Speaker 2>sunlight when you wake up in the morning</v>
<v Speaker 2>or is there a little,</v>

258
00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:18.650
<v Speaker 2>very little,</v>

259
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:20.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

260
00:11:20.061 --> 00:11:20.590
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

261
00:11:20.590 --> 00:11:23.780
<v Speaker 2>I just blacked out my room recently</v>
<v Speaker 2>because I've just got out like I,</v>

262
00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:27.160
<v Speaker 2>my window is like right next to the side</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you're like,</v>

263
00:11:27.161 --> 00:11:28.730
<v Speaker 2>when you wake up,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's just right there is that.</v>

264
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:32.680
<v Speaker 2>She's done that and hotel rooms and I've</v>
<v Speaker 2>always felt like a creep.</v>

265
00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:35.430
<v Speaker 2>I feel like when you're in vegas or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something like that,</v>

266
00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.880
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well I always feel like what?</v>

267
00:11:36.881 --> 00:11:41.200
<v Speaker 2>I'm in a hotel room close like all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>windows and closing all the curtains.</v>

268
00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:44.530
<v Speaker 2>There's something about locking yourself</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a totally dark room.</v>

269
00:11:44.531 --> 00:11:46.760
<v Speaker 2>And a strange place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just bizarre.</v>

270
00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:48.190
<v Speaker 2>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I took like,</v>

271
00:11:48.191 --> 00:11:51.290
<v Speaker 2>I found like there was a little crack</v>
<v Speaker 2>where I couldn't like it,</v>

272
00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:54.040
<v Speaker 2>like my blinds didn't fix or anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So then</v>

273
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:55.750
<v Speaker 4>I went to the store,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hardware store,</v>

274
00:11:55.751 --> 00:11:58.390
<v Speaker 4>and they had like these decals where you</v>
<v Speaker 4>can like put it on your windows.</v>

275
00:11:58.391 --> 00:12:01.590
<v Speaker 4>I made my windows like a stained glass</v>
<v Speaker 4>thinking that way.</v>

276
00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:05.980
<v Speaker 4>So now it's like I have this weird like</v>
<v Speaker 4>blue room that that just closed blue.</v>

277
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:07.780
<v Speaker 4>But it sucks though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I had like,</v>

278
00:12:07.781 --> 00:12:08.770
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why did I do this?</v>

279
00:12:08.771 --> 00:12:12.340
<v Speaker 4>Because now I have no Ita.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If it's daylight or nighttime,</v>

280
00:12:12.341 --> 00:12:13.400
<v Speaker 4>anytime my,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember immigrant,</v>

281
00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:16.690
<v Speaker 4>it's not good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You need a circadian rhythm thing going</v>

282
00:12:16.691 --> 00:12:17.524
<v Speaker 4>on.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

288
00:12:28.041 --> 00:12:30.350
<v Speaker 1>blue lava.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Dude.</v>

<v Speaker 1>The Jersey Devil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever heard of the Jersey Devil?</v>

301
00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:58.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

302
00:12:58.350 --> 00:12:59.910
<v Speaker 1>that lives in the woods in New Jersey.</v>

303
00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.460
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that guy that got poisoning it was</v>
<v Speaker 4>all blue.</v>

304
00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.560
<v Speaker 4>I wonder if it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what's his name?</v>

305
00:13:04.561 --> 00:13:06.810
<v Speaker 4>The Russian.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A Russian guy.</v>

306
00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:08.820
<v Speaker 4>And he got placed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The guy that got poisoned.</v>

307
00:13:08.821 --> 00:13:11.220
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His face changed color turned into Papa</v>

308
00:13:11.221 --> 00:13:12.210
<v Speaker 4>smurf.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

309
00:13:12.211 --> 00:13:14.460
<v Speaker 4>he had all that scar tissue all over his</v>
<v Speaker 4>face.</v>

310
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:15.930
<v Speaker 4>Remember that too?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That guy.</v>

311
00:13:16.150 --> 00:13:18.040
<v Speaker 1>Well that was the crazy guy that did</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

312
00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:22.750
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy was using that colloidal silver</v>

313
00:13:22.751 --> 00:13:24.340
<v Speaker 1>shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was on Oprah.</v>

314
00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.860
<v Speaker 1>He passed away recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately.</v>

315
00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:33.130
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy specifically,</v>

316
00:13:33.131 --> 00:13:34.750
<v Speaker 1>the guy that was on oprah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was blue,</v>

317
00:13:34.751 --> 00:13:38.470
<v Speaker 1>he passed away recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure I read a story about it</v>

318
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:40.070
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

319
00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.040
<v Speaker 1>an entire family.</v>

00:13:42.041 --> 00:13:44.800
<v Speaker 1>that's different than this is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>different guy.</v>

321
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:48.520
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that was their diet to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>blood disorder.</v>

322
00:13:49.150 --> 00:13:50.110
<v Speaker 1>Why don't have to repeat that.</v>

323
00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:55.240
<v Speaker 4>Like we don't speak the same language.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hello?</v>

324
00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:56.590
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Blood disorder.</v>

325
00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:00.220
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other guy was d there's the blue</v>

326
00:14:00.221 --> 00:14:01.990
<v Speaker 1>lava,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the other guy was blue because,</v>

327
00:14:01.991 --> 00:14:02.824
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

328
00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.910
<v Speaker 1>he drank colloidal silver every day</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause he thought it would like,</v>

329
00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:10.630
<v Speaker 1>he'll know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like fix diseases or something like</v>

330
00:14:10.631 --> 00:14:11.890
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

331
00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.170
<v Speaker 1>someone explained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some scientists explained,</v>

332
00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:17.530
<v Speaker 1>it might've been Neil degrasse Tyson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget who it was,</v>

333
00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:22.920
<v Speaker 1>but they explained why drinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>colloidal silver would have that effect</v>

334
00:14:23.921 --> 00:14:25.710
<v Speaker 1>on your body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it was neil degrasse</v>

335
00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.460
<v Speaker 1>Tyson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't remember who it was.</v>

336
00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:29.350
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they went into this scientific</v>

337
00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:34.560
<v Speaker 1>explanation of why drinking coital</v>
<v Speaker 1>silver can permanently stain your body</v>

338
00:14:35.621 --> 00:14:36.640
<v Speaker 1>purple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like that guy,</v>

339
00:14:36.790 --> 00:14:38.800
<v Speaker 1>he must've drank like massive quantities</v>
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>

340
00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:42.730
<v Speaker 1>but I forget what the reaction is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reactions permanent.</v>

341
00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like fucking what the fuck Jesus.</v>

342
00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:50.950
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if the blue is just like,</v>

343
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:56.030
<v Speaker 3>like almost kind of like a fire that's</v>
<v Speaker 3>around the lava that looks blue.</v>

344
00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.320
<v Speaker 3>Kind of like a flame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

345
00:14:57.321 --> 00:15:00.140
<v Speaker 3>in this pit thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's,</v>

346
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:00.801
<v Speaker 3>wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

347
00:15:00.801 --> 00:15:01.634
<v Speaker 3>it isn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

348
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.070
<v Speaker 3>What is that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes no sense.</v>

349
00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:06.833
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

350
00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:10.380
<v Speaker 6>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Cool.</v>

351
00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:15.100
<v Speaker 6>Fumaroles glossed wholesale sulfur gas</v>
<v Speaker 6>staying the surrounding landscape of</v>

352
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:19.550
<v Speaker 6>bright yellow and ignited sulfur burns</v>
<v Speaker 6>with a blue thing.</v>

353
00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:20.630
<v Speaker 3>Oh Wow.</v>

354
00:15:21.290 --> 00:15:24.650
<v Speaker 6>My name is Ruben.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm a photographer and a filmmaker from</v>

355
00:15:24.651 --> 00:15:25.580
<v Speaker 6>Liverpool,</v>
<v Speaker 6>UK.</v>

356
00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:30.170
<v Speaker 6>The currently based in Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The blue flame is too dim to be seen him</v>

357
00:15:30.171 --> 00:15:33.230
<v Speaker 6>the day lights.</v>
<v Speaker 6>So I had to wait until dusk for it to be</v>

358
00:15:33.231 --> 00:15:35.780
<v Speaker 6>seen.</v>
<v Speaker 6>And the moonlight was dull enough to</v>

359
00:15:35.781 --> 00:15:38.660
<v Speaker 6>show the claims as well as reveal the</v>
<v Speaker 6>surrounding landscape.</v>

360
00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:42.710
<v Speaker 6>I also use long exposures in many of my</v>
<v Speaker 6>images,</v>

361
00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:46.430
<v Speaker 6>which allows for pictures,</v>
<v Speaker 6>which show an extended period of time</v>

362
00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:47.780
<v Speaker 6>rather than a split second.</v>

363
00:15:48.950 --> 00:15:51.290
<v Speaker 3>I'm playing a horrible instrument while</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking,</v>

364
00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:54.680
<v Speaker 3>but wait a minute is actually,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why does that look so fake?</v>

365
00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:59.270
<v Speaker 3>He used well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like he used a photo trick to that.</v>

366
00:15:59.271 --> 00:16:00.110
<v Speaker 3>Is that a real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

367
00:16:00.111 --> 00:16:02.950
<v Speaker 3>Real felt photo was that real that we</v>
<v Speaker 3>were just looking at?</v>

368
00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:03.660
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

369
00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:04.493
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Low Gas.</v>

370
00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:08.180
<v Speaker 3>Why does it look almost like a comic</v>
<v Speaker 3>book ish.</v>

371
00:16:08.510 --> 00:16:10.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It does want exposure.</v>

372
00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:11.730
<v Speaker 3>It's allowing that fog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

373
00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.420
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>These pictures are incredible.</v>

374
00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:17.403
<v Speaker 5>Hmm.</v>

375
00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:21.700
<v Speaker 3>This is incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This photographer is fucking amazing.</v>

376
00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:25.310
<v Speaker 3>He has a good camera nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nowadays I look at this,</v>

377
00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:29.350
<v Speaker 3>the fact that he's captured this shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is he the first guy to ever capture this</v>

378
00:16:29.351 --> 00:16:32.650
<v Speaker 3>stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this something that people don't</v>

379
00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:36.160
<v Speaker 3>about?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to see video of it live though.</v>

380
00:16:36.161 --> 00:16:37.000
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the problem.</v>

381
00:16:37.001 --> 00:16:39.190
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if this is just a photo trick</v>
<v Speaker 3>like yeah,</v>

382
00:16:39.191 --> 00:16:41.860
<v Speaker 3>there's a little blue flame to it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so I might keep the exposure open a</v>

383
00:16:41.861 --> 00:16:44.680
<v Speaker 3>little so it looks a little bit more</v>
<v Speaker 3>blue than it would if with your naked</v>

384
00:16:44.681 --> 00:16:45.760
<v Speaker 3>eye.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is video.</v>

385
00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:47.260
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I guess you're right.</v>

386
00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:49.810
<v Speaker 3>That just looks like fire or something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

387
00:16:49.811 --> 00:16:51.700
<v Speaker 3>that's kind of what he said it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was like the methane.</v>

388
00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:53.730
<v Speaker 3>It's an sulfur head and all our,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

389
00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:57.070
<v Speaker 3>it's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's incredible.</v>

390
00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.000
<v Speaker 3>They have software problems here in Los</v>
<v Speaker 3>Angeles.</v>

391
00:16:59.001 --> 00:17:00.280
<v Speaker 3>So you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you go through some of these,</v>

392
00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:01.390
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>places.</v>

393
00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:03.730
<v Speaker 3>It just smells like farts everywhere</v>
<v Speaker 3>because of the sulfur.</v>

394
00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:04.810
<v Speaker 3>Sulfur.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

395
00:17:04.811 --> 00:17:06.400
<v Speaker 3>I think it's software.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

396
00:17:06.490 --> 00:17:09.580
<v Speaker 3>in Calabasas when I lived there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would sometimes it would just smell</v>

397
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:13.780
<v Speaker 3>like eggs everywhere and it's because of</v>
<v Speaker 3>sulfur.</v>

398
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:16.930
<v Speaker 3>We said what it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is like a natural software that</v>

399
00:17:16.931 --> 00:17:18.190
<v Speaker 3>comes out of the ground and comes out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>it.</v>

400
00:17:18.191 --> 00:17:19.330
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It comes out of the ground.</v>

401
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:21.700
<v Speaker 3>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>speaking of that,</v>

402
00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:24.110
<v Speaker 3>like what is up with that gas leak?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

403
00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:25.870
<v Speaker 3>Apparently it's horrific.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

404
00:17:25.871 --> 00:17:27.370
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's really bad.</v>

405
00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:30.100
<v Speaker 3>It's going to take them months to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

406
00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.940
<v Speaker 3>to try to figure it out and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and close it off.</v>

407
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:35.980
<v Speaker 3>It could get worse.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

408
00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.020
<v Speaker 3>They like something could happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It seems like somebody could</v>

409
00:17:38.021 --> 00:17:39.650
<v Speaker 3>accidentally smoke a cigarette down,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

410
00:17:39.651 --> 00:17:43.660
<v Speaker 3>and like we blow up all of my dog.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how flammable it is.</v>

411
00:17:43.661 --> 00:17:45.430
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's something like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

412
00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.050
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't know if it's something that's easy</v>

413
00:17:47.051 --> 00:17:48.490
<v Speaker 3>to ignite.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

414
00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:51.660
<v Speaker 3>But I know it's health concern.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

415
00:17:52.130 --> 00:17:55.320
<v Speaker 3>I mean I think there's a concern too</v>
<v Speaker 3>that it might collapse further.</v>

416
00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.260
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

417
00:17:57.261 --> 00:18:00.960
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't know exactly how to shut that</v>

418
00:18:00.961 --> 00:18:03.930
<v Speaker 3>thing off quick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's going to take them some time and</v>

419
00:18:03.931 --> 00:18:08.050
<v Speaker 3>some engineering couldn't they just pour</v>
<v Speaker 3>a shitload of concrete all over it and</v>

420
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:10.110
<v Speaker 3>just walk away and man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's gas.</v>

421
00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:12.690
<v Speaker 3>I don't know how they do this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really,</v>

422
00:18:12.691 --> 00:18:17.691
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't even begin to wrap my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my puny little mind around what kind of</v>

423
00:18:19.081 --> 00:18:24.081
<v Speaker 3>knowledge it takes to stop a fucking gas</v>
<v Speaker 3>leak in a pipe natural gas to,</v>

424
00:18:24.901 --> 00:18:26.760
<v Speaker 3>it's different than like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>is it car?</v>

425
00:18:26.761 --> 00:18:27.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm kind of asking,</v>

426
00:18:27.930 --> 00:18:31.380
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was type California gas</v>

427
00:18:31.381 --> 00:18:33.240
<v Speaker 3>hasn't dropped like it has all over the</v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

428
00:18:33.630 --> 00:18:35.070
<v Speaker 3>It gets pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like almost,</v>

429
00:18:35.071 --> 00:18:37.050
<v Speaker 3>it was under a dollar for a little while</v>
<v Speaker 3>in Ohio.</v>

430
00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.730
<v Speaker 3>Well three almost $4.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Some places people love to hear that</v>

431
00:18:41.731 --> 00:18:44.080
<v Speaker 3>we're going back to the seventies man is</v>
<v Speaker 3>great.</v>

432
00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:46.780
<v Speaker 3>But what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

433
00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.080
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a methane though,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

434
00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:51.330
<v Speaker 3>That's what I would think it's car gas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If I was kind of wondering.</v>

435
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:52.980
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think it is a natural gas.</v>

436
00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.350
<v Speaker 3>I think that's the whole point that day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it's a,</v>

437
00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:56.750
<v Speaker 3>but it's a pipe,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

438
00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:59.760
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pipe that pumps gas to all these people</v>

439
00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:04.290
<v Speaker 3>and it broke and they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they say that the whole is really big</v>

440
00:19:04.291 --> 00:19:08.460
<v Speaker 3>now cause it's like they,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this fucking eight foot wide hole.</v>

441
00:19:08.670 --> 00:19:12.090
<v Speaker 3>I think there's people that live around</v>
<v Speaker 3>there that can't go home like they had</v>

442
00:19:12.091 --> 00:19:15.060
<v Speaker 3>to replace.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I like a whole neighborhoods of people</v>

443
00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.740
<v Speaker 3>and they can't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they still can't go home.</v>

444
00:19:16.741 --> 00:19:18.300
<v Speaker 3>To this day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can't go home.</v>

445
00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:19.380
<v Speaker 3>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

446
00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:24.380
<v Speaker 3>they had evacuated 2.5 million pounds of</v>
<v Speaker 3>methane every day.</v>

447
00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:27.600
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's be honest.</v>

448
00:19:27.601 --> 00:19:29.550
<v Speaker 3>Methane's air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So it doesn't really weigh anything.</v>

449
00:19:29.551 --> 00:19:31.230
<v Speaker 3>So it could be £1 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

450
00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:37.550
<v Speaker 3>but it's an 8 billion pounds of meth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>

451
00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:42.000
<v Speaker 3>How did they measure what's maybe it</v>
<v Speaker 3>actually has weight to it.</v>

452
00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:43.740
<v Speaker 3>That's how it gets how you get to a</v>
<v Speaker 3>pound.</v>

453
00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.980
<v Speaker 3>It's like measuring a pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a lot.</v>

454
00:19:46.981 --> 00:19:51.140
<v Speaker 3>Then it has to be a ways and nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a lot slower.</v>

455
00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:55.710
<v Speaker 3>Ton of feathers in a ton of bricks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like it's still a ton.</v>

456
00:19:56.130 --> 00:19:58.830
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but this is 2.5 million pounds of Shit.</v>

457
00:19:58.831 --> 00:19:59.910
<v Speaker 3>So light,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it can float.</v>

458
00:20:00.390 --> 00:20:03.210
<v Speaker 3>So it's like the individual particles</v>
<v Speaker 3>are very light.</v>

459
00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:05.250
<v Speaker 3>They're floating right there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Gases.</v>

460
00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:07.410
<v Speaker 3>Maybe we're getting scammed and we don't</v>
<v Speaker 3>even know it.</v>

461
00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:11.730
<v Speaker 3>This Jackson guys like we need more</v>
<v Speaker 3>money to get this all this pounds of</v>

462
00:20:11.731 --> 00:20:13.590
<v Speaker 3>gas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

463
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:19.070
<v Speaker 3>that's a very good point.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Bp can go to where the kid to grow.</v>

464
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:26.970
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's what it pumps into things</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then now it's like just blowing out</v>

465
00:20:26.971 --> 00:20:28.710
<v Speaker 3>into the air.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe that's how they're measuring it.</v>

466
00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:30.750
<v Speaker 3>I think that's what it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's what pumps through there.</v>

467
00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:33.150
<v Speaker 3>The whole thing is nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

468
00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.320
<v Speaker 3>That says they tried to use in mud,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they tried doing concrete.</v>

469
00:20:36.330 --> 00:20:39.240
<v Speaker 3>God,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

470
00:20:39.241 --> 00:20:42.570
<v Speaker 3>When I hear they tried to do it but it</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't work.</v>

471
00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.570
<v Speaker 3>I fucking freak out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>

472
00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.190
<v Speaker 3>That is like the last thing</v>

473
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:50.590
<v Speaker 1>I ever want to hear when there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>national crisis,</v>

474
00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:51.753
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

475
00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:53.620
<v Speaker 1>they tried to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't work like,</v>

476
00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:56.910
<v Speaker 1>oh Christ.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I th they they,</v>

477
00:20:56.990 --> 00:20:59.320
<v Speaker 1>this is a hard one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not easy.</v>

478
00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.530
<v Speaker 1>We're just so lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're smart people out there.</v>

479
00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.340
<v Speaker 1>We'd be so fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We would be so fucked.</v>

480
00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:09.730
<v Speaker 1>We're so lucky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's engineers at work on this kind</v>

481
00:21:09.731 --> 00:21:12.010
<v Speaker 1>of shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you don't even think about it.</v>

482
00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:17.170
<v Speaker 1>We don't think about the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about the fucking highway system</v>

483
00:21:17.171 --> 00:21:18.910
<v Speaker 1>and you complain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

484
00:21:18.911 --> 00:21:23.650
<v Speaker 1>you'll let go the fuck and work in Jesus</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christ to got this lane cut off so they</v>

485
00:21:23.651 --> 00:21:26.350
<v Speaker 1>could fix the road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the FOC.</v>

486
00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:31.590
<v Speaker 1>But think about how in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how fucking cool it is that we've</v>

487
00:21:32.591 --> 00:21:37.591
<v Speaker 1>hardened the ground and smoothed it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All look cross this mother fucker.</v>

488
00:21:38.890 --> 00:21:39.910
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and everybody's like,</v>

489
00:21:39.911 --> 00:21:42.610
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fucking rubes ruin the landscape.</v>

490
00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:45.130
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of places and this place is</v>

491
00:21:45.131 --> 00:21:45.921
<v Speaker 1>one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

492
00:21:45.921 --> 00:21:48.040
<v Speaker 1>And it looks like shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a bunch of roads.</v>

493
00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.500
<v Speaker 1>We over did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we overdid it.</v>

494
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:53.410
<v Speaker 1>We've got crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We put too many roads in one spot,</v>

495
00:21:53.411 --> 00:21:58.411
<v Speaker 1>too many buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We ignored the rules of having food</v>

496
00:21:58.961 --> 00:22:02.920
<v Speaker 1>nearby and vegetables and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We ignored all that.</v>

497
00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:05.170
<v Speaker 1>We just said no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just fucking piled on top of each</v>

498
00:22:05.171 --> 00:22:06.430
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Woo.</v>

499
00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:07.870
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's what we did.</v>

500
00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:12.900
<v Speaker 1>But the idea is fucking amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that when you're in a place</v>

501
00:22:13.421 --> 00:22:17.140
<v Speaker 1>like Montana and you're driving through</v>
<v Speaker 1>these mountain ranges,</v>

502
00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:18.730
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the roads don't bother you,</v>

503
00:22:18.731 --> 00:22:19.990
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't bother you.</v>

504
00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:24.580
<v Speaker 1>You don't care if there's a road there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause you're looking up at this insane</v>

505
00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:26.890
<v Speaker 1>natural beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you're just like,</v>

506
00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.590
<v Speaker 1>just fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is crazy.</v>

507
00:22:29.890 --> 00:22:33.700
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is like the most insane artwork you</v>

508
00:22:33.701 --> 00:22:38.230
<v Speaker 1>could ever buy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could never look as beautiful as this.</v>

509
00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:43.210
<v Speaker 1>Like really amazing artwork is always</v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing to see someone's expression and</v>

510
00:22:43.211 --> 00:22:44.770
<v Speaker 1>when someone does something that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>really dope,</v>

511
00:22:44.771 --> 00:22:45.604
<v Speaker 1>it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gives every,</v>

512
00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:47.380
<v Speaker 1>all this good feeling like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

513
00:22:47.381 --> 00:22:50.380
<v Speaker 1>that was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a cool piece of art.</v>

514
00:22:50.381 --> 00:22:52.390
<v Speaker 1>That's a beautiful sculpture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

515
00:22:52.391 --> 00:22:55.630
<v Speaker 1>that's a pretty painting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when you see the mountains,</v>

516
00:22:55.631 --> 00:22:57.940
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something about those things</v>

517
00:22:57.941 --> 00:22:59.710
<v Speaker 1>like a snow cap mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

518
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:01.180
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

519
00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:04.200
<v Speaker 2>And it's limited if you think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

520
00:23:04.201 --> 00:23:06.120
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's look at that fucking view.</v>

521
00:23:06.150 --> 00:23:07.980
<v Speaker 2>That's not going to exist in a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

522
00:23:07.981 --> 00:23:10.230
<v Speaker 2>That view right there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's going to be so many drones</v>

523
00:23:10.231 --> 00:23:13.260
<v Speaker 2>flying around Amazon prime crap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's going to be people with their</v>

524
00:23:13.261 --> 00:23:17.670
<v Speaker 2>hover boards up in the air like it</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's not going to exist in a hundred</v>

525
00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:18.420
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That view.</v>

526
00:23:18.420 --> 00:23:20.730
<v Speaker 2>Well that we would have to preserve it.</v>

527
00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:23.960
<v Speaker 1>That's what the idea of having,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

528
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:30.070
<v Speaker 1>public wilderness public a forests to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stuff that it's supposed to be ours.</v>

529
00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:34.370
<v Speaker 1>That's what Teddy Roosevelt wanted to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>way back in the dame.</v>

530
00:23:34.371 --> 00:23:39.371
<v Speaker 1>And when they instituted these ideas and</v>
<v Speaker 1>got a public land,</v>

531
00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:45.470
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like signed off to to us so that like</v>

532
00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.950
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's giant swaths of this country</v>

533
00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:53.490
<v Speaker 1>that are ours as American taxpayers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>camping.</v>

534
00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:54.830
<v Speaker 1>And what's that?</v>

535
00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:58.320
<v Speaker 4>Does that include the sky in the future?</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's probably not like that shit.</v>

536
00:23:58.380 --> 00:24:00.420
<v Speaker 4>That shit's going to be filled with</v>
<v Speaker 4>advertising and stuff.</v>

537
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:04.010
<v Speaker 4>There's going to be a drone that just</v>
<v Speaker 4>sits there that just for a year,</v>

538
00:24:04.430 --> 00:24:08.320
<v Speaker 1>probably try to make some laws against</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if it becomes a real problem.</v>

539
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:09.940
<v Speaker 1>But like yellowstone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

540
00:24:09.941 --> 00:24:13.840
<v Speaker 1>look at Yellowstone National Park,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a place is fucking amazing man.</v>

541
00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:17.380
<v Speaker 1>And it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an incredible place to visit.</v>

542
00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:20.290
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you have a real good chance of</v>

543
00:24:20.291 --> 00:24:23.860
<v Speaker 1>seeing like bisons and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got a good chance to see in a</v>

544
00:24:23.861 --> 00:24:27.580
<v Speaker 1>fucking bear too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You gotta be real careful because um,</v>

545
00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:33.300
<v Speaker 1>they've killed hikers like more than I</v>
<v Speaker 1>think it was more than one attack.</v>

546
00:24:34.871 --> 00:24:38.950
<v Speaker 1>And I know at least one dead over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>last like five or six years,</v>

547
00:24:38.951 --> 00:24:42.700
<v Speaker 1>because they think that these bears are</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting too accustomed to being around</v>

548
00:24:42.701 --> 00:24:44.890
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They know that if you break into</v>

549
00:24:44.891 --> 00:24:46.990
<v Speaker 1>someone's car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they usually have food in there.</v>

550
00:24:47.140 --> 00:24:49.230
<v Speaker 1>They know that coolers usually have food</v>
<v Speaker 1>in them.</v>

551
00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:51.700
<v Speaker 1>They get smart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so once they come around,</v>

552
00:24:51.701 --> 00:24:53.170
<v Speaker 1>people once like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

553
00:24:53.171 --> 00:24:54.850
<v Speaker 1>then they start coming around all the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

554
00:24:56.390 --> 00:24:59.210
<v Speaker 4>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been fucking with my neighbor like</v>

<v Speaker 4>want to admit this.</v>

557

<v Speaker 4>you better stop right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so fun to do though.</v>

583
00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.350
<v Speaker 4>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>

584
00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:16.060
<v Speaker 4>but it's really super illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

585
00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:19.010
<v Speaker 4>I guess it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What if you had kids in there?</v>

586
00:26:19.011 --> 00:26:21.920
<v Speaker 4>I'm just playing gay porn.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's exactly what I'm saying.</v>

587
00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:26.720
<v Speaker 4>Get a bike is just so you could see you,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

588
00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:27.620
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>exactly.</v>

589
00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:29.933
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

590
00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:33.900
<v Speaker 4>I love that shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That that in printers like it when</v>

591
00:26:33.901 --> 00:26:38.040
<v Speaker 4>people have printers on their Wifi and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you just print out dick pics all day on</v>

592
00:26:38.041 --> 00:26:40.320
<v Speaker 4>their printers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's rude as well.</v>

593
00:26:41.150 --> 00:26:44.070
<v Speaker 1>That was rude as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you this,</v>

594
00:26:44.550 --> 00:26:49.550
<v Speaker 2>have you ever wondered if like we can</v>
<v Speaker 2>feel Wifi and have you ever wondered</v>

595
00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:54.630
<v Speaker 2>like if we can feel electricity in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>room,</v>

596
00:26:54.631 --> 00:26:59.160
<v Speaker 2>like maybe it's not enough where we</v>
<v Speaker 2>could tell for sure if it was happening</v>

597
00:26:59.161 --> 00:27:02.430
<v Speaker 2>or if it's not happening but enough</v>
<v Speaker 2>where there's like there's just like a</v>

598
00:27:02.431 --> 00:27:06.240
<v Speaker 2>subtle underlying thing that your body</v>
<v Speaker 2>is experiencing.</v>

599
00:27:06.990 --> 00:27:09.930
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't really make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like a radio wave,</v>

600
00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.690
<v Speaker 2>like radio waves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why Fi's satellites,</v>

601
00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:16.890
<v Speaker 2>satellite radio and TV,</v>
<v Speaker 2>satellite signals,</v>

602
00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:20.580
<v Speaker 2>w gps signals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's all this.</v>

603
00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:24.780
<v Speaker 2>We're sure for sure as it's not doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>anything to us cause we haven't really</v>

604
00:27:24.781 --> 00:27:28.380
<v Speaker 2>been doing that for that long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that something to be worried about?</v>

605
00:27:28.530 --> 00:27:31.770
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you take a cat who's most sensitive</v>

606
00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:36.390
<v Speaker 2>animal ever that gave you that cats like</v>
<v Speaker 2>just sitting there and you turn on</v>

607
00:27:36.391 --> 00:27:40.140
<v Speaker 2>something right next to it that has wifi</v>
<v Speaker 2>right next to his little whiskers,</v>

608
00:27:40.141 --> 00:27:43.650
<v Speaker 2>you would think it would even maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>twitch just a teeny bit.</v>

609
00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:44.700
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I'm sure it doesn't,</v>

610
00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:46.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think so man,</v>

611
00:27:46.621 --> 00:27:48.540
<v Speaker 2>when you like your remote control,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your cat,</v>

612
00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:52.470
<v Speaker 2>if you like remote controlled your cat</v>
<v Speaker 2>like they were cat would like,</v>

613
00:27:52.471 --> 00:27:53.550
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck you doing?</v>

614
00:27:53.590 --> 00:27:55.860
<v Speaker 2>You Man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if there's anything the cat</v>

615
00:27:55.861 --> 00:27:57.300
<v Speaker 2>would feel it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think if any animal,</v>

616
00:27:57.301 --> 00:28:01.590
<v Speaker 2>the cat would be the first thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the cats can tripping on ghost.</v>

617
00:28:01.591 --> 00:28:03.060
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the cat.</v>

618
00:28:03.061 --> 00:28:08.061
<v Speaker 2>Cats have amazing senses except the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sense like they're not intelligent.</v>

619
00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:12.120
<v Speaker 2>They're not intelligent like a person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have amazing census,</v>

620
00:28:12.121 --> 00:28:14.490
<v Speaker 2>like their senses are off the charts for</v>
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

621
00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I would think that if anything a cat,</v>

622
00:28:17.330 --> 00:28:22.290
<v Speaker 2>but I would think that their senses are</v>
<v Speaker 2>only around to do what they need to do</v>

623
00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.870
<v Speaker 2>in the natural world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's why the sense is a</v>

624
00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:27.900
<v Speaker 2>sensitive smell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can feel things,</v>

625
00:28:27.901 --> 00:28:30.390
<v Speaker 2>you know the it can like feel the ground</v>
<v Speaker 2>moving.</v>

626
00:28:30.570 --> 00:28:33.900
<v Speaker 2>Their pads on their paws are like really</v>
<v Speaker 2>soft.</v>

627
00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.720
<v Speaker 2>You know when they can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can walk like really quietly when</v>

628
00:28:36.721 --> 00:28:39.750
<v Speaker 2>they're sneaking up on shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like cats are fascinating little animals</v>

629
00:28:39.751 --> 00:28:41.880
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you watched it and the cucumber</v>

630
00:28:41.881 --> 00:28:43.320
<v Speaker 2>videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cats,</v>

631
00:28:43.470 --> 00:28:45.540
<v Speaker 2>it's probably one of my favorite thing</v>
<v Speaker 2>for some reason.</v>

632
00:28:45.541 --> 00:28:47.130
<v Speaker 2>If you'd take,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't do this to your cat.</v>

633
00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:51.180
<v Speaker 2>Supposedly it it's mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you take a cucumber,</v>

634
00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:53.700
<v Speaker 2>put it behind your cat when it's not</v>
<v Speaker 2>looking.</v>

635
00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:56.160
<v Speaker 2>If the cat turns around and looks at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cucumber,</v>

636
00:28:56.340 --> 00:28:59.080
<v Speaker 2>it will freak the fuck out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like something in its DNA.</v>

637
00:28:59.081 --> 00:29:00.990
<v Speaker 2>It makes it think it's a snake or</v>
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>

638
00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:04.290
<v Speaker 2>But there's videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of videos on youtube,</v>

639
00:29:04.291 --> 00:29:06.750
<v Speaker 2>but people trying it almost all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

640
00:29:06.751 --> 00:29:09.210
<v Speaker 2>If a cat sees a cucumber just laying up</v>
<v Speaker 2>behind it,</v>

641
00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:12.660
<v Speaker 2>it will jump up and run away or great</v>
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>

642
00:29:12.661 --> 00:29:13.650
<v Speaker 2>Have you seen these videos?</v>

643
00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:16.860
<v Speaker 2>Why a cucumber?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think it's something in their DNA that</v>

644
00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:18.390
<v Speaker 2>that just thinks it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

645
00:29:18.391 --> 00:29:22.920
<v Speaker 2>dangerous snake or or,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for whatever reason somebody just</v>

646
00:29:22.921 --> 00:29:25.650
<v Speaker 2>found out by mistake that you put a</v>
<v Speaker 2>cucumber behind a cat,</v>

647
00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:28.530
<v Speaker 2>it'll freak it out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then there's all these animal people</v>

648
00:29:28.531 --> 00:29:29.760
<v Speaker 2>that are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't do that.</v>

649
00:29:29.761 --> 00:29:32.670
<v Speaker 2>You're stressing her cat out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I could see because all the cats</v>

650
00:29:32.671 --> 00:29:35.580
<v Speaker 2>reactions are like death.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like get the fuck out of here</v>

651
00:29:35.581 --> 00:29:36.600
<v Speaker 2>immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

652
00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.060
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty funny though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's some of the funniest videos.</v>

653
00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:42.130
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever see his and cucumber</v>

654
00:29:42.220 --> 00:29:42.851
<v Speaker 3>on Youtube?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

655
00:29:42.851 --> 00:29:45.730
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to freak cats out man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This are pissing all over the place.</v>

656
00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:46.240
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right,</v>

657
00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.070
<v Speaker 3>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You Freak your cat out.</v>

658
00:29:48.071 --> 00:29:50.410
<v Speaker 3>They will fucking piss in your pillow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I told him.</v>

659
00:29:50.411 --> 00:29:52.930
<v Speaker 3>Sure I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I haven't had a cat and almost a year</v>

660
00:29:52.990 --> 00:29:56.140
<v Speaker 3>and I don't miss the litter box.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't miss that smell.</v>

661
00:29:56.141 --> 00:29:58.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't think I might.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I might never get a cat again.</v>

662
00:29:58.660 --> 00:30:00.940
<v Speaker 3>The litter box things a fucking real</v>
<v Speaker 3>issue.</v>

663
00:30:00.970 --> 00:30:02.960
<v Speaker 3>You have a box of shit in your house.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

664
00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:05.920
<v Speaker 3>Fox is shit and cat piss from ungrateful</v>
<v Speaker 3>roommate.</v>

665
00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.400
<v Speaker 3>That doesn't pay shit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then it gets mad at you when he tried to</v>

666
00:30:09.401 --> 00:30:10.870
<v Speaker 3>trim their hair.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

667
00:30:14.050 --> 00:30:15.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My cat scan,</v>

668
00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:19.240
<v Speaker 3>they get trimmed and they freak out</v>
<v Speaker 3>about it and it doesn't hurt them and I</v>

669
00:30:19.241 --> 00:30:22.360
<v Speaker 3>pet him the whole time when the lady's</v>
<v Speaker 3>grooming him.</v>

670
00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:25.600
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of my daughters is allergic to cats</v>

671
00:30:25.601 --> 00:30:28.660
<v Speaker 3>and it makes a big difference if you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we trim the cat's hair.</v>

672
00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:31.620
<v Speaker 3>She doesn't have a bad allergy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's certainly an hour change.</v>

673
00:30:31.621 --> 00:30:35.950
<v Speaker 3>She's been tested for it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So when I'm doing this,</v>

674
00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:39.040
<v Speaker 3>I have to fucking just hang out with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>cat the entire time.</v>

675
00:30:39.041 --> 00:30:39.851
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just chill,</v>

676
00:30:39.851 --> 00:30:41.230
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm telling you,</v>

677
00:30:41.231 --> 00:30:43.660
<v Speaker 3>that ain't nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was just a little massage with a</v>

678
00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.960
<v Speaker 3>little thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you trim it or do you have somebody</v>

679
00:30:45.961 --> 00:30:46.960
<v Speaker 3>to call?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The lady does it.</v>

680
00:30:46.961 --> 00:30:49.000
<v Speaker 3>She's a professional,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's a,</v>

681
00:30:49.001 --> 00:30:52.090
<v Speaker 3>it's weird to see them fucking freaking</v>
<v Speaker 3>out about it.</v>

682
00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:54.070
<v Speaker 3>I had a cat once.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It loved it.</v>

683
00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:55.713
<v Speaker 3>She loved it.</v>

684
00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:59.890
<v Speaker 3>Spazz spas would just chill like you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you would do it and she'd,</v>

685
00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:01.430
<v Speaker 3>she just hang out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's pass.</v>

686
00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:04.180
<v Speaker 3>It's not around anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry.</v>

687
00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:08.380
<v Speaker 3>She was 19.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

688
00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.470
<v Speaker 3>She made it a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That was a cool cat.</v>

689
00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:14.650
<v Speaker 3>She's a very cool cat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been thinking though,</v>

690
00:31:14.651 --> 00:31:17.110
<v Speaker 3>cause I mean I've lived with cats in my</v>
<v Speaker 3>whole entire life.</v>

691
00:31:17.111 --> 00:31:19.090
<v Speaker 3>I've been thinking of getting one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't.</v>

692
00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.700
<v Speaker 3>That kind of a thing is a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They'd get mad at you.</v>

693
00:31:21.701 --> 00:31:24.270
<v Speaker 3>They pee places.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

694
00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.380
<v Speaker 3>for whatever reason.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And if you have another animal,</v>

695
00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:28.000
<v Speaker 3>it's just a lottery.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If it gets,</v>

696
00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:31.270
<v Speaker 3>it gets along with the other hand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The more now it's a total lottery.</v>

697
00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:34.510
<v Speaker 3>Especially cats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cats usually don't get along with other</v>

698
00:31:34.511 --> 00:31:39.511
<v Speaker 3>cats like it took my 19 year old cat,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a solid five years to get used to Oliver</v>

699
00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:44.500

<v Speaker 3>just likes to chill and hang out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the other cat of the fluff at the</v>

713
00:32:26.801 --> 00:32:29.260
<v Speaker 3>white one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that one is um,</v>

714
00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.740
<v Speaker 3>she's a little bit more assertive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like she,</v>

715
00:32:32.741 --> 00:32:35.560
<v Speaker 3>it's funny like she attacks him like,</v>

<v Speaker 3>and like he'll be like hanging out and</v>

718
00:32:45.921 --> 00:32:48.650
<v Speaker 3>she'll be like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he doesn't know that she's back there.</v>

719
00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:50.630
<v Speaker 3>So she knows.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't know.</v>

720
00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:55.370
<v Speaker 3>So her little legs start shaking and her</v>
<v Speaker 3>tail starts flickering and she's moving</v>

721
00:32:55.371 --> 00:32:59.150
<v Speaker 3>real close and then she pounces on him</v>
<v Speaker 3>and fucks him up and then he put the</v>

722
00:32:59.151 --> 00:33:03.500
<v Speaker 3>fuck bitch and he backs up and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>chase each other for a couple of feet.</v>

723
00:33:03.530 --> 00:33:08.030
<v Speaker 3>It's hilarious man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they're both such pussies cause</v>

00:33:08.031 --> 00:33:11.420
<v Speaker 3>they're both rag dolls like they're the</v>
<v Speaker 3>nicest cats.</v>

725
00:33:11.421 --> 00:33:13.010
<v Speaker 3>Even when they fight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't even fight.</v>

726
00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:18.400
<v Speaker 3>Even when they fight like fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they barely do anything to each other.</v>

727
00:33:19.071 --> 00:33:20.900
<v Speaker 3>They're like fake fighting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know?</v>

728
00:33:20.901 --> 00:33:22.460
<v Speaker 3>They like each other.</v>

00:33:40.221 --> 00:33:43.940
<v Speaker 2>but I know like three people that do it</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it worked almost immediately.</v>

740
00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:46.490
<v Speaker 3>The Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Robert Schimmel had a bit about it.</v>

<v Speaker 3>And then to recover from that and then</v>

<v Speaker 2>that uh,</v>

761
00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:44.140
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like when you go to the comedy store and</v>

762
00:34:44.141 --> 00:34:46.600
<v Speaker 2>you look at the walls of how many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

<v Speaker 2>great comics that just fucking</v>
<v Speaker 2>disappeared.</v>

764
00:34:49.901 --> 00:34:54.340
<v Speaker 2>And I'll sit there sometimes and just</v>
<v Speaker 2>google everybody's name that's on the</v>

767
00:34:56.860 --> 00:35:00.220
<v Speaker 2>And it's amazing how they just fall off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

768
00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:03.550
<v Speaker 2>just disappear and never do anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like what happened to the,</v>

770
00:35:06.810 --> 00:35:07.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

771
00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:11.550
<v Speaker 3>people get lost in life and people move</v>
<v Speaker 3>on to other shit too though.</v>

772
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:13.290
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes people just decide they don't</v>

773
00:35:13.291 --> 00:35:17.640
<v Speaker 3>want the stress of performing anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe they like other creative</v>

774
00:35:17.641 --> 00:35:18.980
<v Speaker 3>endeavors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

775
00:35:19.010 --> 00:35:23.310
<v Speaker 3>you and I talked about that for a while</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you weren't doing stand up,</v>

776
00:35:23.550 --> 00:35:25.770
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you were making these funny videos and</v>

777
00:35:25.771 --> 00:35:26.450
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

778
00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:26.880
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm,</v>

779
00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:29.370
<v Speaker 3>I'm already kind of a comedian.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

780
00:35:29.371 --> 00:35:32.190
<v Speaker 3>it's just my audience is the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When you were doing videos,</v>

781
00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:34.850
<v Speaker 3>which that was an excuse because I</v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't want to do standup.</v>

782
00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:37.020
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>after I did that Bob hope joke,</v>

783
00:35:37.050 --> 00:35:37.771
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm good,</v>

784
00:35:37.771 --> 00:35:37.980
<v Speaker 3>I'm</v>

785
00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:40.170
<v Speaker 1>done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to ever feel that pain ever</v>

786
00:35:40.200 --> 00:35:41.820
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

787
00:35:41.821 --> 00:35:44.910
<v Speaker 1>And some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the risk of that pain,</v>

788
00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:46.980
<v Speaker 1>it's just not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not worth it.</v>

789
00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:48.810
<v Speaker 1>It's not worth it to do that to your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

790
00:35:48.830 --> 00:35:53.460
<v Speaker 1>When you maybe also like painting or</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe also like writing books or maybe</v>

791
00:35:53.461 --> 00:35:56.310
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people you don't have to do it.</v>

792
00:35:56.350 --> 00:35:57.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that's the thing about standups</v>

793
00:35:57.961 --> 00:35:59.340
<v Speaker 1>tell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you do it and you don't want to</v>

794
00:35:59.341 --> 00:36:00.600
<v Speaker 1>do it anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody's like,</v>

795
00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:04.350
<v Speaker 1>you don't even want to do it anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

796
00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:05.910
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you fucking sell out.</v>

797
00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:09.030
<v Speaker 1>Like people will say that about 80</v>
<v Speaker 1>murphy,</v>

798
00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.171
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

799
00:36:10.171 --> 00:36:11.280
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not real stand up.</v>

800
00:36:11.281 --> 00:36:12.840
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't do standup anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll get here,</v>

801
00:36:12.841 --> 00:36:15.300
<v Speaker 1>like the hardcore bros talking like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

802
00:36:15.710 --> 00:36:19.790
<v Speaker 2>I can see it's hard because to be a</v>
<v Speaker 2>standup you really still,</v>

803
00:36:19.791 --> 00:36:21.980
<v Speaker 2>even though how rich you get,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you become a movie star,</v>

804
00:36:21.981 --> 00:36:25.460
<v Speaker 2>you're a millionaire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You still have to go and in practice and</v>

805
00:36:25.461 --> 00:36:28.250
<v Speaker 2>go to the comedy clubs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I can see where it's easy to quit.</v>

806
00:36:28.251 --> 00:36:29.780
<v Speaker 2>If you get to a certain point where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

807
00:36:29.781 --> 00:36:30.614
<v Speaker 2>you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

808
00:36:30.770 --> 00:36:32.210
<v Speaker 2>I'm a grown adult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am rich.</v>

809
00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:34.550
<v Speaker 2>I have a wife and kids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to go through this little</v>

810
00:36:34.551 --> 00:36:37.220
<v Speaker 2>shitty club and practice these new</v>
<v Speaker 2>chokes,</v>

811
00:36:37.221 --> 00:36:39.950

<v Speaker 1>it's like exhausting cause like safe.</v>

815
00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:53.100
<v Speaker 1>You started some pursuit in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like if you started off and you are a</v>

816

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's okay.</v>

826
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:22.860
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever think you ever see me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm off hills home.</v>

827
00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:26.580
<v Speaker 2>Do you ever think there's like something</v>
<v Speaker 2>that you haven't started yet?</v>

828
00:37:26.581 --> 00:37:27.091
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

829
00:37:27.091 --> 00:37:27.750
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just,</v>

00:37:27.750 --> 00:37:29.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to learn how to play guitar</v>
<v Speaker 2>this year.</v>

831
00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:32.490
<v Speaker 2>Like is there anything that you've in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the back of your head that you've kind</v>

832
00:37:32.491 --> 00:37:34.410
<v Speaker 2>of fucked around with?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like the idea of</v>

833
00:37:34.870 --> 00:37:37.750
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because I suck so hard at the new things</v>

834
00:37:37.751 --> 00:37:39.910
<v Speaker 1>that I'm doing already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that true?</v>

835
00:37:40.030 --> 00:37:42.910
<v Speaker 1>You started becoming an archer and now</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're fucking Robin Hood and you're</v>

836
00:37:42.911 --> 00:37:43.744
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they like?</v>

837
00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:44.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

838
00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:49.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm not good at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm constantly practicing at archery,</v>

839
00:37:49.890 --> 00:37:52.390
<v Speaker 1>but as you compare it to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to somebody who's really good,</v>

840
00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:55.540
<v Speaker 1>like I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I put a lot of hours in,</v>

841
00:37:55.570 --> 00:37:56.970
<v Speaker 1>I practice a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

842
00:37:57.110 --> 00:37:59.800
<v Speaker 1>I'll shoot like sometimes a hundred</v>
<v Speaker 1>hours in a day.</v>

843
00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:01.000
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

844
00:38:02.170 --> 00:38:02.860
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

845
00:38:02.860 --> 00:38:05.920
<v Speaker 1>cause I kind of obsessed with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And some sort of a weird way,</v>

846
00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:07.510
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fascinating to me.</v>

847
00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:11.140
<v Speaker 1>So that's one thing I already obsessed</v>
<v Speaker 1>with that I suck at.</v>

848
00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:15.760
<v Speaker 1>And when I meet you like compare me to</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone like Cameron Hanes or a</v>

849
00:38:15.761 --> 00:38:17.590
<v Speaker 1>professional archer that you like might</v>
<v Speaker 1>see on,</v>

850
00:38:17.770 --> 00:38:21.130
<v Speaker 1>like a friend of mine just sent me this</v>
<v Speaker 1>photo of my friend Johnny Rivet sent me</v>

851
00:38:21.131 --> 00:38:22.330
<v Speaker 1>this photo of this young girl.</v>

852
00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:27.480
<v Speaker 1>She's like 20 years old and she's won</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I think he said three world</v>

853
00:38:28.301 --> 00:38:31.390
<v Speaker 1>championships in a row and she's an</v>
<v Speaker 1>archer.</v>

854
00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:34.740
<v Speaker 1>They don't like those people were like</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good with bows and arrows.</v>

855
00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:39.750
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a total next level when</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like they're shooting at like 50</v>

856
00:38:39.941 --> 00:38:43.420
<v Speaker 1>yards and they're hitting the bullseye</v>
<v Speaker 1>every time.</v>

857
00:38:43.450 --> 00:38:48.450
<v Speaker 1>And the on the acts itself at 50 yards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just dead calm and just dead on</v>

858
00:38:49.481 --> 00:38:52.030
<v Speaker 1>the inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when they released that string,</v>

859
00:38:52.031 --> 00:38:56.080
<v Speaker 1>nothing moves and that Arrow goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>sailing right into that acts.</v>

860
00:38:56.081 --> 00:38:59.380
<v Speaker 1>And they can do it repeatedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can do it like 10 times in a row</v>

861
00:38:59.381 --> 00:39:00.490
<v Speaker 1>sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

862
00:39:00.491 --> 00:39:03.370
<v Speaker 1>these people were freaks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting to watch.</v>

863
00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:06.950
<v Speaker 2>We used to do archery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an elementary school that was a part of</v>

864
00:39:06.951 --> 00:39:10.550
<v Speaker 2>our physical education and I'm sure you</v>
<v Speaker 2>can't do that anymore.</v>

865
00:39:10.580 --> 00:39:11.720
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I probably,</v>

866
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:12.650
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet not.</v>

867
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:16.550
<v Speaker 2>Is it illegal to walk around Robin Hood</v>
<v Speaker 2>style with the arch you like,</v>

868
00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:17.690
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like a bow and Arrow?</v>

869
00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:20.240
<v Speaker 2>Like is like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can I walk into like an old guard and</v>

870
00:39:20.241 --> 00:39:21.680
<v Speaker 2>not get kicked out if I have a</v>

871
00:39:21.950 --> 00:39:23.090
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wouldn't let you in.</v>

872
00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:24.980
<v Speaker 1>It's a weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

873
00:39:24.981 --> 00:39:27.010
<v Speaker 1>it's a weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a slingshot to like,</v>

874
00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:31.100
<v Speaker 1>I had some friends who brought their</v>
<v Speaker 1>bows to Vegas and they,</v>

875
00:39:31.101 --> 00:39:31.880
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

876
00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:34.070
<v Speaker 1>the hotel wouldn't let them take him up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to their room.</v>

877
00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.240
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

878
00:39:35.270 --> 00:39:36.320
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had to check them.</v>

879
00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:39.170
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had to check in with the hotel.</v>

880
00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:41.180
<v Speaker 1>It didn't seem right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

881
00:39:41.210 --> 00:39:44.420
<v Speaker 1>it's seemed well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah though it does like what some</v>

882
00:39:44.421 --> 00:39:48.710
<v Speaker 1>fucking asshole is going to be on your</v>
<v Speaker 1>elevator with a bow and Arrow,</v>

883
00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:50.960
<v Speaker 1>but you have a shooting people in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>area,</v>

884
00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:54.710
<v Speaker 1>but you can't like trust these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't know him.</v>

885
00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:56.090
<v Speaker 1>These people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they come in,</v>

886
00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:58.160
<v Speaker 1>they're not even Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got a bow and arrow.</v>

887
00:39:58.161 --> 00:39:59.870
<v Speaker 1>They're crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

888
00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:00.471
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

889
00:40:00.471 --> 00:40:01.940
<v Speaker 1>you can't have this in your room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give us,</v>

890
00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:03.020
<v Speaker 1>give me that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

891
00:40:03.021 --> 00:40:05.660
<v Speaker 1>like you come to the saloon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put your fucking gun in the bucket,</v>

892
00:40:05.661 --> 00:40:08.070
<v Speaker 1>sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know hotel,</v>

893
00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:10.400
<v Speaker 1>but give me your fucking bow and arrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

894
00:40:10.401 --> 00:40:13.700
<v Speaker 1>you can't practice it in your room and</v>
<v Speaker 1>accidentally shoot the fucking</v>

895
00:40:13.701 --> 00:40:15.890
<v Speaker 1>television.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know you.</v>

896
00:40:16.010 --> 00:40:19.310
<v Speaker 1>What if you get whiskey it up and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>working on your fucking draw length in</v>

897
00:40:19.311 --> 00:40:23.030
<v Speaker 1>your hotel room and you send your Arrow</v>
<v Speaker 1>flying through the middle of the</v>

898
00:40:23.031 --> 00:40:26.000
<v Speaker 1>electrical box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It caused a fucking 13 story fire that</v>

899
00:40:26.001 --> 00:40:26.990
<v Speaker 1>killed a thousand people.</v>

900
00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:28.580
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what have you used the steak night</v>

901
00:40:28.581 --> 00:40:30.830
<v Speaker 2>from your state?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can you just start stabbing everybody?</v>

902
00:40:30.831 --> 00:40:31.581
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

903
00:40:31.581 --> 00:40:35.840
<v Speaker 2>I think of that a steak knife would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>way more dangerous than a bow.</v>

904
00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:37.760
<v Speaker 2>You got to stop putting ideas in</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's heads.</v>

905
00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:41.210
<v Speaker 2>It's like airplanes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like I always freak out word like,</v>

906
00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:43.430
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't have a razor blade on the</v>

907
00:40:43.431 --> 00:40:45.440
<v Speaker 2>airplane,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but yet you could have a Mac book pro</v>

908
00:40:45.441 --> 00:40:48.470
<v Speaker 2>that you can smack over the head of</v>
<v Speaker 2>somebody and probably kill him.</v>

909
00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:49.340
<v Speaker 2>It's hard to grip though.</v>

910
00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:50.970
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like real impact,</v>

911
00:40:51.030 --> 00:40:54.030
<v Speaker 1>but a skateboard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's if fuck somebody up on a</v>

912
00:40:54.031 --> 00:40:56.190
<v Speaker 1>skateboard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

913
00:40:56.430 --> 00:40:59.400
<v Speaker 1>you can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they were going to change</v>

914
00:40:59.401 --> 00:41:00.420
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think they did.</v>

915
00:41:00.690 --> 00:41:04.830
<v Speaker 1>They were going to make it so that it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>legal to bring pool cues on.</v>

916
00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:08.430
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they made it so that it's not</v>

917
00:41:08.431 --> 00:41:12.390
<v Speaker 1>anymore</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause like they thought that you beat</v>

918
00:41:12.391 --> 00:41:13.780
<v Speaker 1>people up with a pool cue but you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

919
00:41:13.781 --> 00:41:16.710
<v Speaker 1>skateboards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably a better weapon than a pool cue</v>

920
00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:17.933
<v Speaker 1>maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

921
00:41:18.690 --> 00:41:21.120
<v Speaker 1>More distance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly more distance she knew.</v>

922
00:41:21.121 --> 00:41:22.770
<v Speaker 1>And the person you're trying to hit with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a skateboard,</v>

923
00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:26.340
<v Speaker 1>which makes it more effective in a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>of places because you could hit somebody</v>

924
00:41:26.341 --> 00:41:27.220
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't hit you yet.</v>

925
00:41:27.230 --> 00:41:28.440
<v Speaker 1>Poke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's going to break pretty quick,</v>

926
00:41:28.441 --> 00:41:30.970
<v Speaker 1>right though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One good hit and maybe that's</v>

927
00:41:30.971 --> 00:41:33.380
<v Speaker 1>skateboards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got trucks that hands on what it's out</v>

928
00:41:33.381 --> 00:41:34.010
<v Speaker 1>of.</v>

929
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.610
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

930
00:41:34.610 --> 00:41:38.510
<v Speaker 1>most pool cues have multiple pieces and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

931
00:41:38.511 --> 00:41:42.200
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not one gigantic piece of wood</v>

932
00:41:42.350 --> 00:41:44.240
<v Speaker 1>because for most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the most part,</v>

933
00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:46.520
<v Speaker 1>like if you'd see like a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a beautiful pool cue,</v>

934
00:41:47.420 --> 00:41:50.690
<v Speaker 1>what a lot of players,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they liked the queue to be 19</v>

935
00:41:50.691 --> 00:41:52.070
<v Speaker 1>ounces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

936
00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:53.180
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>

937
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:56.750
<v Speaker 1>they work on making this a few people</v>
<v Speaker 1>that like 20,</v>

938
00:41:56.770 --> 00:42:00.740
<v Speaker 1>20 is rare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes you'll find the outliers</v>

939
00:42:00.741 --> 00:42:03.890
<v Speaker 1>that like something heavy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're pretty specifically between</v>

940
00:42:03.891 --> 00:42:06.470
<v Speaker 1>18 and 20 ounces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now for a normal person that would seem</v>

941
00:42:06.471 --> 00:42:07.970
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what's the difference?</v>

942
00:42:08.210 --> 00:42:10.320
<v Speaker 1>Well to the pool players,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's uh,</v>

943
00:42:10.410 --> 00:42:15.410
<v Speaker 1>the professionals and it's a touch that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they develop where they know the exact</v>

944
00:42:15.801 --> 00:42:18.710
<v Speaker 1>weight of their queue and so the exact</v>
<v Speaker 1>impact in half,</v>

945
00:42:18.711 --> 00:42:21.230
<v Speaker 1>so they have to balance it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And a lot of times the way they bounce</v>

946
00:42:21.231 --> 00:42:24.740
<v Speaker 1>it out is by using different kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 1>woods leaves one kind of wood for what</v>

947
00:42:24.741 --> 00:42:26.750
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but another kind of wood for under the</v>

948
00:42:26.751 --> 00:42:27.440
<v Speaker 1>wrap.</v>

949
00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:29.090
<v Speaker 1>And it'll be a lighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a maple,</v>

950
00:42:29.091 --> 00:42:31.490
<v Speaker 1>like similar to like maybe shaft would</v>
<v Speaker 1>even like.</v>

951
00:42:31.910 --> 00:42:34.190
<v Speaker 1>And then on the outsides of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

952
00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:38.870
<v Speaker 1>the front and the back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might even just be cord where they</v>

953
00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:43.960
<v Speaker 1>drill through the actual hardwood and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they stuff a core in there of a softer</v>

954
00:42:44.301 --> 00:42:47.960
<v Speaker 1>would.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the cue achieves the desired look and</v>

955
00:42:47.961 --> 00:42:50.900
<v Speaker 1>may be uniform field,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has a lower mass,</v>

956
00:42:50.901 --> 00:42:54.860
<v Speaker 1>lower weight so he can get it down to</v>
<v Speaker 1>like maybe even below 19 ounces or you</v>

957
00:42:54.861 --> 00:42:56.870
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for reasonably,</v>

958
00:42:56.871 --> 00:42:58.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well done.</v>

959
00:42:58.311 --> 00:42:59.780
<v Speaker 1>Cute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you hit somebody the head with</v>

960
00:42:59.781 --> 00:43:02.750
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to break for the most part.</v>

961
00:43:04.510 --> 00:43:06.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you get one of those fucking</v>

962
00:43:06.981 --> 00:43:10.400
<v Speaker 1>house cues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like those full splice house cues and</v>

963
00:43:10.401 --> 00:43:12.110
<v Speaker 1>you grab the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hard end,</v>

964
00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:14.840
<v Speaker 1>the dark end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could beat the fuck out of somebody</v>

965
00:43:14.841 --> 00:43:15.674
<v Speaker 1>with one of those.</v>

966
00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:20.210
<v Speaker 1>That's a different animal because that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>an one solid piece of wood,</v>

967
00:43:20.330 --> 00:43:23.810
<v Speaker 1>especially those old school ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those are like the Dufferin blanks,</v>

968
00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:24.750
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a,</v>

969
00:43:24.751 --> 00:43:27.530
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a rosewood on the bottom and a</v>

970
00:43:27.531 --> 00:43:30.260
<v Speaker 1>maple on the top and right from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>splice where it's white,</v>

971
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:33.080
<v Speaker 1>that stuff's going to break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the stuff above it,</v>

972
00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:37.760
<v Speaker 1>you could beat the fuck out of somebody</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the stuff above it.</v>

973
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:39.080
<v Speaker 1>That hard shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could,</v>

974
00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:41.870
<v Speaker 1>you could hit them as hard as you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably wouldn't break it.</v>

975
00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:43.620
<v Speaker 1>Probably be pretty hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

976
00:43:44.210 --> 00:43:45.980
<v Speaker 1>People were like all four could do it</v>
<v Speaker 1>bro.</v>

977
00:43:46.190 --> 00:43:47.660
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you can,</v>

978
00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:52.130
<v Speaker 1>but maybe like a normal person would be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be very hard to break that on</v>

979
00:43:52.131 --> 00:43:54.200
<v Speaker 1>somebody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do it.</v>

980
00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:56.710
<v Speaker 1>You could be some fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

981
00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:01.070
<v Speaker 1>incredible hulk type character and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>smash it on the first attempt.</v>

982
00:44:01.071 --> 00:44:06.071
<v Speaker 1>But I would imagine like it's a much</v>
<v Speaker 1>harder and denser,</v>

983
00:44:06.550 --> 00:44:09.680
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like weapon than a,</v>

984
00:44:10.010 --> 00:44:12.860
<v Speaker 1>like a standard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like very pretty pool cue or someone</v>

985
00:44:12.861 --> 00:44:17.861
<v Speaker 1>like a lot of Pokios or like artistic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really interesting because people</v>

986
00:44:17.931 --> 00:44:19.790
<v Speaker 1>outside the pool world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would,</v>

987
00:44:19.850 --> 00:44:22.160
<v Speaker 1>they would think like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are you talking about?</v>

988
00:44:22.161 --> 00:44:25.910
<v Speaker 1>There's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's like a collectors like group of</v>

989
00:44:25.911 --> 00:44:28.850
<v Speaker 1>pool cue addicts and they're addicted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pool cues.</v>

990
00:44:28.851 --> 00:44:30.620
<v Speaker 1>They collect cues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Dude,</v>

991
00:44:30.621 --> 00:44:32.070
<v Speaker 1>you'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's guys out there</v>

992
00:44:32.070 --> 00:44:34.860
<v Speaker 3>that have collections.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're worth 1 million bucks and more</v>

993
00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:36.930
<v Speaker 3>and pool cues.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

994
00:44:36.931 --> 00:44:40.080
<v Speaker 3>There's people that have coin</v>
<v Speaker 3>collections of butterfly things like</v>

995
00:44:40.081 --> 00:44:42.800
<v Speaker 3>people that collect butterflies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's the creepiest shit head.</v>

996
00:44:42.930 --> 00:44:47.250
<v Speaker 3>You got a dead bug pins all over it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've gotten a new one.</v>

997
00:44:47.550 --> 00:44:48.900
<v Speaker 3>I'm cautious.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Knew who won.</v>

998
00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:51.390
<v Speaker 3>There was um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

999
00:44:51.450 --> 00:44:55.350
<v Speaker 3>Terence Mckenna and an old lecture was</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about,</v>

1000
00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.580
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>catching bugs and that there's something</v>

1001
00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:02.310
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because we used to eat bugs a lot when</v>

1002
00:45:02.311 --> 00:45:06.060
<v Speaker 3>we were like primates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that there's almost like this genetic</v>

1003
00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:08.880
<v Speaker 3>excitement thing that comes when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>catch a bug.</v>

1004
00:45:08.990 --> 00:45:11.610
<v Speaker 3>So it's similar to what happens when you</v>
<v Speaker 3>catch a fish.</v>

1005
00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:13.710
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that thing that happens when you catch a</v>

1006
00:45:13.711 --> 00:45:15.880
<v Speaker 3>fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you fish for it,</v>

1007
00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:18.540
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you're a fish and then ate it,</v>

1008
00:45:18.990 --> 00:45:19.950
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>once,</v>

1009
00:45:19.951 --> 00:45:21.050
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>just once.</v>

1010
00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:23.640
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You haven't been fishing since dad,</v>

1011
00:45:23.700 --> 00:45:25.620
<v Speaker 3>like 14,</v>
<v Speaker 3>15.</v>

1012
00:45:25.650 --> 00:45:26.820
<v Speaker 3>He would always take me fishing.</v>

1013
00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:28.680
<v Speaker 3>That's wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1014
00:45:28.810 --> 00:45:30.600
<v Speaker 3>that's fish since then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fishing's fun,</v>

1015
00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:31.560
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's awesome.</v>

1016
00:45:31.590 --> 00:45:34.110
<v Speaker 3>It's a great way to catch a meal to</v>
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

1017
00:45:34.380 --> 00:45:38.310
<v Speaker 3>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but there's some weird fucking primal</v>

1018
00:45:38.311 --> 00:45:40.180
<v Speaker 3>thing that happens when you pull it out</v>
<v Speaker 3>of the water.</v>

1019
00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:43.500
<v Speaker 3>Oh he feel like smeagol like or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

1020
00:45:43.501 --> 00:45:45.440
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like he gets like,</v>

1021
00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:51.830
<v Speaker 3>it's flopping around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>attack me.</v>

1022
00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:55.380
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's something weird about it.</v>

1023
00:45:55.770 --> 00:46:00.390
<v Speaker 3>There's something weird about a fish.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You catching something and some alien</v>

1024
00:46:00.391 --> 00:46:03.870
<v Speaker 3>world yanking it out of their lives in</v>
<v Speaker 3>the water.</v>

1025
00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:09.080
<v Speaker 3>There's a living thing in the water and</v>
<v Speaker 3>you can see him down there fucking cast</v>

1026
00:46:09.331 --> 00:46:14.331
<v Speaker 3>to them and you throw a piece of meat</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's covered by a hook and he bites</v>

1027
00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:18.780
<v Speaker 3>the meat and you will fucking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys,</v>

1028
00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:23.840
<v Speaker 3>dad hooked through the top of his mouth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a giant steel barb digs into his face</v>

1029
00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:30.590
<v Speaker 3>and then he's still fighting like hard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>like polling left and right and left and</v>

1030
00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:36.030
<v Speaker 3>the rod is pulling the real is fucking</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1031
00:46:36.031 --> 00:46:36.301
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1032
00:46:36.301 --> 00:46:37.500
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is that thing called?</v>

1033
00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:39.150
<v Speaker 3>The clicky thing on the wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The drag,</v>

1034
00:46:39.330 --> 00:46:44.330
<v Speaker 3>the drag and the real is it's peeling</v>
<v Speaker 3>cause it's fucking fish pulling outline</v>

1035
00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:48.420
<v Speaker 3>and you finally get him in there and you</v>
<v Speaker 3>suck them out of his dementia and he's</v>

1036
00:46:48.421 --> 00:46:53.190
<v Speaker 3>flopping around your boat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is a crazy experience to crazy.</v>

1037
00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:56.730
<v Speaker 3>You just pulled some alien creature.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like lives in the water.</v>

1038
00:46:56.820 --> 00:46:59.580
<v Speaker 3>500 years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's say 500 years.</v>

1039
00:46:59.890 --> 00:47:04.200
<v Speaker 3>They're definitely going to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 3>how to take animals and make them be</v>

1040
00:47:04.201 --> 00:47:06.900
<v Speaker 3>able to communicate to us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to make that crossover.</v>

1041
00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:08.430
<v Speaker 3>500 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fuck yeah,</v>

1042
00:47:08.490 --> 00:47:10.170
<v Speaker 3>maybe not even 500 years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

1043
00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:13.560
<v Speaker 3>But when that happens,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're not going to go fishing anymore</v>

1044
00:47:13.561 --> 00:47:17.700
<v Speaker 3>cause you're going to be like talking to</v>
<v Speaker 3>fucking fish are all going to die.</v>

1045
00:47:17.701 --> 00:47:19.800
<v Speaker 3>We're all going to be vegans.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're going to be forced to be vegans</v>

1046
00:47:19.801 --> 00:47:24.801
<v Speaker 3>because of technology.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well if we do know for sure what an</v>

1047
00:47:25.051 --> 00:47:28.860
<v Speaker 3>animal's feeling when it dies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would definitely be way hard.</v>

1048
00:47:28.861 --> 00:47:29.694
<v Speaker 3>Eat me</v>

1049
00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:32.920
<v Speaker 1>way harder.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's um,</v>

1050
00:47:34.030 --> 00:47:37.600
<v Speaker 1>that's the argument of like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Vegan movement.</v>

1051
00:47:37.601 --> 00:47:40.570
<v Speaker 1>That makes the most sense because if</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd really knew,</v>

1052
00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:44.200
<v Speaker 1>but here's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of these motherfuckers didn't even</v>

1053
00:47:44.201 --> 00:47:46.870
<v Speaker 1>care about each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like those deer that I eat,</v>

1054
00:47:46.871 --> 00:47:49.420
<v Speaker 1>they kill each other all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fucking stab each other with the</v>

1055
00:47:49.421 --> 00:47:51.400
<v Speaker 1>horns and to their heads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bears,</v>

1056
00:47:51.401 --> 00:47:52.780
<v Speaker 1>bears early.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cannibals,</v>

1057
00:47:53.050 --> 00:47:55.240
<v Speaker 1>they're all cannibals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People get angry.</v>

1058
00:47:55.241 --> 00:47:56.920
<v Speaker 1>Like if you eat black bear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like first of all,</v>

1059
00:47:56.921 --> 00:47:59.110
<v Speaker 1>black bears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>delicious and bears are fucking</v>

1060
00:47:59.111 --> 00:48:01.150
<v Speaker 1>monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're cannibals.</v>

1061
00:48:01.410 --> 00:48:02.750
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't mean we don't want to kill</v>

1062
00:48:02.751 --> 00:48:04.370
<v Speaker 1>them or don't want,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1063
00:48:04.550 --> 00:48:06.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let them live or wanting to extinguish</v>

1064
00:48:06.731 --> 00:48:07.780
<v Speaker 1>all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1065
00:48:07.810 --> 00:48:08.770
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're cool.</v>

1066
00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:14.040
<v Speaker 1>It's cool having these animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't give a fuck about you get</v>

1067
00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:18.280
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kinda recognize that they do not give a</v>

1068
00:48:18.281 --> 00:48:21.520
<v Speaker 1>fuck about you until they start talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>to us and then we find out they're just</v>

1069
00:48:21.521 --> 00:48:25.050
<v Speaker 1>very hard to get to know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they were really loving it.</v>

1070
00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:30.730
<v Speaker 1>He just got to take it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if you found out what they were</v>

1071
00:48:30.731 --> 00:48:32.650
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could you imagine if you could read</v>

1072
00:48:32.651 --> 00:48:36.220
<v Speaker 1>minds and you just looked out into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>pack of wolves?</v>

1073
00:48:36.430 --> 00:48:38.650
<v Speaker 1>There was chasing elk up to the top of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain.</v>

1074
00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:42.700
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how terrified you would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you could read the mind of a wolf?</v>

1075
00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:44.020
<v Speaker 1>He'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

1076
00:48:44.021 --> 00:48:46.600
<v Speaker 1>we've got to kill them all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God,</v>

1077
00:48:46.601 --> 00:48:49.120
<v Speaker 1>we got to kill them all to the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these you want to do is kill.</v>

1078
00:48:49.500 --> 00:48:52.030
<v Speaker 1>I told the one and two Kale if we could</v>
<v Speaker 1>read them,</v>

1079
00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:54.160
<v Speaker 1>but we don't read their minds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we look at him like,</v>

1080
00:48:54.190 --> 00:48:54.971
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to him.</v>

1081
00:48:54.971 --> 00:48:59.650
<v Speaker 1>How</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's just jack that they got to kill</v>

1082
00:48:59.651 --> 00:49:02.050
<v Speaker 1>again today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1083
00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:06.880
<v Speaker 1>they have a problem with these elk that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they find where a wolves get into these</v>

1084
00:49:06.881 --> 00:49:11.881
<v Speaker 1>a elk elk populations and they decimate</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hertz.</v>

1085
00:49:12.190 --> 00:49:14.380
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't even eat everything they</v>

1086
00:49:14.381 --> 00:49:15.700
<v Speaker 1>kill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's crazy.</v>

1087
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:20.590
<v Speaker 1>They'll kill like many elk and just</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave half the body behind her more.</v>

1088
00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:23.290
<v Speaker 1>They don't just sit and eat it until</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're done.</v>

1089
00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:25.120
<v Speaker 1>They kill again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They kill again.</v>

1090
00:49:25.121 --> 00:49:26.490
<v Speaker 1>Just like dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know?</v>

1091
00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:27.640
<v Speaker 1>You ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you ever heard of it?</v>

1092
00:49:27.641 --> 00:49:29.230
<v Speaker 1>Like my dog got it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My chickens.</v>

1093
00:49:29.231 --> 00:49:32.200
<v Speaker 1>Once my dog is killed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two of my chickens.</v>

1094
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:34.150
<v Speaker 1>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fucking real drag,</v>

1095
00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:35.980
<v Speaker 1>but it's instinct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1096
00:49:36.010 --> 00:49:39.640
<v Speaker 1>It's not a bad dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just nobody told he can't talk.</v>

1097
00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:42.550
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't know in his mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chickens or death.</v>

1098
00:49:42.551 --> 00:49:43.930
<v Speaker 1>You've got to kill that fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There it is.</v>

1099
00:49:43.931 --> 00:49:46.450
<v Speaker 1>Go get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like it's programmed in him,</v>

1100
00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:51.160
<v Speaker 1>so he's a dog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like you literally cannot take it</v>

1101
00:49:51.161 --> 00:49:52.510
<v Speaker 1>out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1102
00:49:52.511 --> 00:49:56.050
<v Speaker 1>you could grow them up with from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time they're puppies with chickens,</v>

1103
00:49:56.170 --> 00:50:00.100
<v Speaker 1>just like I did with my cats or the dogs</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think of the cats is the enemy,</v>

1104
00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:03.790
<v Speaker 1>but if they don't grow up with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't just accept chickens into the</v>

1105
00:50:03.791 --> 00:50:06.040
<v Speaker 1>fucking yard and the dog is seven years</v>
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>

1106
00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:08.590
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck it is?</v>

1107
00:50:08.830 --> 00:50:09.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chickens live with us.</v>

1108
00:50:09.851 --> 00:50:10.860
<v Speaker 1>They're our friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1109
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:11.800
<v Speaker 1>your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1110
00:50:11.801 --> 00:50:13.270
<v Speaker 1>Your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your friends.</v>

1111
00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:14.640
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1112
00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:16.510
<v Speaker 1>I'll just leave me alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When your friends want to talk to them,</v>

1113
00:50:16.810 --> 00:50:19.410
<v Speaker 1>just Jack Them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was just Jack and check.</v>

1114
00:50:19.411 --> 00:50:22.510
<v Speaker 1>It's not his fault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's his dog instincts.</v>

1115
00:50:22.790 --> 00:50:24.820
<v Speaker 1>Me Never knew that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not supposed to eat chickens</v>

1116
00:50:24.821 --> 00:50:26.560
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a grown dog.</v>

1117
00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:31.730
<v Speaker 1>Wolves are very similar in that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to kill things and they're</v>

1118
00:50:31.731 --> 00:50:34.910
<v Speaker 1>beautiful and they're amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying we shouldn't have wolves,</v>

1119
00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:39.950
<v Speaker 1>but people have this idea that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't keep an eye on those fucking</v>

1120
00:50:39.951 --> 00:50:42.470
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Tom,</v>

1121
00:50:42.850 --> 00:50:44.550
<v Speaker 1>I'm tired of talking to people about</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

1122
00:50:45.180 --> 00:50:46.440
<v Speaker 1>Like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wolves are awesome.</v>

1123
00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:47.880
<v Speaker 1>It's like there was a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1124
00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:51.720
<v Speaker 1>in Canada they're using helicopters to</v>
<v Speaker 1>shoot wolves.</v>

1125
00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:55.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause the Caribou population is getting</v>

1126
00:50:55.191 --> 00:50:59.150
<v Speaker 1>decimated because they just go on a jack</v>
<v Speaker 1>and spree,</v>

1127
00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:00.020
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

1128
00:51:00.020 --> 00:51:00.800
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>

1129
00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:02.870
<v Speaker 1>Eh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wolves just take over.</v>

1130
00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:08.030
<v Speaker 1>They just run rampant when they're get</v>
<v Speaker 1>to a sufficient population where they</v>

1131
00:51:08.031 --> 00:51:10.310
<v Speaker 1>can just dominate herds and surround</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

1132
00:51:10.311 --> 00:51:12.890
<v Speaker 1>And they're like raising them like</v>
<v Speaker 1>cattle.</v>

1133
00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:16.970
<v Speaker 1>They're monsters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Matt and the Jack Gigantic numbers of a,</v>

1134
00:51:16.971 --> 00:51:19.880
<v Speaker 1>if they want to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not conservationists.</v>

1135
00:51:20.970 --> 00:51:24.090
<v Speaker 4>Have you heard about the people taking</v>
<v Speaker 4>dogs in the New York City at night to</v>

1142
00:51:33.321 --> 00:51:34.760
<v Speaker 4>hearing a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like Mike Rowe,</v>

1143
00:51:34.761 --> 00:51:37.260
<v Speaker 4>the guy from dirty jobs talking on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1144
00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:39.200
<v Speaker 4>the OPN,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jimmy show one day about it.</v>

1145
00:51:39.201 --> 00:51:40.760
<v Speaker 4>Like if he went out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't think he went out with these</v>

1146
00:51:40.761 --> 00:51:44.120
<v Speaker 4>people for a few nights in a row and</v>
<v Speaker 4>made a little documentary online trying</v>

1147
00:51:44.121 --> 00:51:45.200
<v Speaker 4>to find it right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But uh,</v>

1148
00:51:45.530 --> 00:51:47.600
<v Speaker 4>they said it was crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like the guard for their backs and just</v>

1149
00:51:47.601 --> 00:51:50.300
<v Speaker 4>break their backs and toss them around</v>
<v Speaker 4>and just throw them and go after another</v>

1150
00:51:50.301 --> 00:51:51.530
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>

1151
00:51:51.531 --> 00:51:54.410
<v Speaker 4>Hundreds will come out of a rap pile or</v>
<v Speaker 4>like in a dumpster and shit.</v>

1152
00:51:54.411 --> 00:51:57.440
<v Speaker 4>Like that dog just jacking him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God,</v>

1153
00:51:57.900 --> 00:52:00.630
<v Speaker 1>that's so crazy though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they just do that.</v>

1154

00:56:53.051 --> 00:56:53.800
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

1271
00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:56.770
<v Speaker 1>I know you pushed me off and now I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>back and I want the exact same thing I</v>

1272
00:56:56.771 --> 00:56:58.900
<v Speaker 1>wanted a couple of seconds ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

1273
00:56:58.901 --> 00:57:00.370
<v Speaker 1>it was going to try and do a little</v>
<v Speaker 1>slower.</v>

1274
00:57:00.371 --> 00:57:02.260
<v Speaker 1>Maybe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like he doesn't give a fuck.</v>

1275
00:57:02.261 --> 00:57:04.720
<v Speaker 1>He just wants massages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>period.</v>

1276
00:57:04.870 --> 00:57:08.560
<v Speaker 1>Give it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would have to spray him with water to</v>

1277
00:57:08.561 --> 00:57:11.190
<v Speaker 1>get them off me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only one.</v>

1278
00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:13.840
<v Speaker 1>Even that just the sound,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I don't want it to,</v>

1279
00:57:14.110 --> 00:57:15.880
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want them to chill out.</v>

1280
00:57:16.060 --> 00:57:18.370
<v Speaker 1>Just once you just relax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just hang out with me,</v>

1281
00:57:18.371 --> 00:57:20.590
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have to demand attention.</v>

1282
00:57:20.591 --> 00:57:22.210
<v Speaker 1>You fucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1283
00:57:23.610 --> 00:57:27.180
<v Speaker 2>Did you see that there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I guess a new either movie or series Oj</v>

1284
00:57:27.181 --> 00:57:28.440
<v Speaker 2>Simpson versus the people?</v>

1285
00:57:29.070 --> 00:57:29.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1286
00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:34.650
<v Speaker 1>I was talking about this with</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone and uh,</v>

1287
00:57:35.070 --> 00:57:37.410
<v Speaker 1>it was a good point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1288
00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:40.830
<v Speaker 1>that the people that are growing up</v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

1289
00:57:41.310 --> 00:57:43.920
<v Speaker 1>like the 20 year olds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't even know that story.</v>

1290
00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:47.400
<v Speaker 1>I think for us it was a part of our life</v>
<v Speaker 1>growing up.</v>

1291
00:57:47.401 --> 00:57:48.510
<v Speaker 1>Could we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Holy Shit,</v>

1292
00:57:48.511 --> 00:57:51.060
<v Speaker 1>he got off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got off.</v>

1293
00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:53.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody was pretty much convinced he</v>

1294
00:57:53.971 --> 00:57:57.810
<v Speaker 1>was guilty except those people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>needed to be convinced</v>

1295
00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:00.650
<v Speaker 2>the lead up to it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of the most popular movies,</v>

1296
00:58:00.651 --> 00:58:03.200
<v Speaker 2>the naked gun series,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all kind of fell in love with this</v>

1297
00:58:03.201 --> 00:58:04.280
<v Speaker 2>like guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1298
00:58:04.281 --> 00:58:05.114
<v Speaker 2>it was kind of like</v>

1299
00:58:05.210 --> 00:58:10.210
<v Speaker 1>what not that guy and have nowhere that</v>
<v Speaker 1>took two years of everyone's life</v>

1300
00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:12.680
<v Speaker 1>following this guy's story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And still,</v>

1301
00:58:12.681 --> 00:58:16.100
<v Speaker 1>it's still fascinating to this day when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see him on tv,</v>

1302
00:58:16.101 --> 00:58:18.590
<v Speaker 1>when there's like some sort of a prison</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing going on.</v>

1303
00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:21.200
<v Speaker 1>And then you see they have photos of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them and they're moving them around or</v>

1304
00:58:21.201 --> 00:58:22.160
<v Speaker 1>something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like,</v>

1305
00:58:22.170 --> 00:58:24.160
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whew.</v>

1306
00:58:24.410 --> 00:58:26.120
<v Speaker 1>There's a strange to see man.</v>

1307
00:58:26.420 --> 00:58:30.200
<v Speaker 2>I wonder if there's any way to do any</v>
<v Speaker 2>new evidence using today's DNA</v>

1308
00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:32.960
<v Speaker 2>technology to find out if he,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1309
00:58:32.961 --> 00:58:34.210
<v Speaker 2>like this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this making the murder,</v>

1310
00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:35.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you haven't watched it yet.</v>

1311
00:58:36.050 --> 00:58:38.000
<v Speaker 2>Just making this murder things</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting cause of like,</v>

1312
00:58:38.001 --> 00:58:40.340
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the technology that they're using</v>

1313
00:58:40.930 --> 00:58:43.280
<v Speaker 2>and stuff like jumping a Ramsey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like they,</v>

1314
00:58:43.281 --> 00:58:46.730
<v Speaker 2>it seems like they should be able to</v>
<v Speaker 2>find who killed her now you using</v>

1315
00:58:46.731 --> 00:58:48.310
<v Speaker 2>today's technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1316
00:58:48.310 --> 00:58:51.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much evidence they</v>
<v Speaker 1>still have that they have saved.</v>

1317
00:58:51.491 --> 00:58:53.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how that works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1318
00:58:53.470 --> 00:58:56.920
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how that works?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure they have evidence.</v>

1319
00:58:56.921 --> 00:58:58.780
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would imagine.</v>

1320
00:58:58.870 --> 00:58:59.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

1321
00:58:59.830 --> 00:59:01.540
<v Speaker 1>They can go back in there and find,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1322
00:59:01.541 --> 00:59:03.670
<v Speaker 1>use this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know,</v>

1323
00:59:03.671 --> 00:59:06.370
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the real problem with that John</v>

1324
00:59:06.370 --> 00:59:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Benet things that they had fucked up the</v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence.</v>

1325
00:59:08.620 --> 00:59:11.710
<v Speaker 1>One of the parts of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the murder case that was fucked up as it</v>

1326
00:59:11.711 --> 00:59:16.060
<v Speaker 1>was like fresh snow and uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people would have been able to</v>

1327
00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:21.620
<v Speaker 1>find footprints and the fresh snow and</v>
<v Speaker 1>these cops tread all over everything and</v>

1328
00:59:21.831 --> 00:59:22.664
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

1329
00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:26.450
<v Speaker 3>that was a big mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And that the way they investigated it,</v>

1330
00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:29.900
<v Speaker 3>apparently there were a bunch of</v>
<v Speaker 3>criticisms about the way they handle it.</v>

1331
00:59:29.930 --> 00:59:33.500
<v Speaker 3>They just had never handled a case like</v>
<v Speaker 3>that before as the boulder police</v>

1332
00:59:33.501 --> 00:59:37.090
<v Speaker 3>department,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Boulder's a small town and the Johan,</v>

1333
00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:40.660
<v Speaker 3>we got a lot of fucking crazy people</v>
<v Speaker 3>murdering their kids or in I'll</v>

1334
00:59:40.661 --> 00:59:43.400
<v Speaker 3>allegedly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they don't even know who did it.</v>

1335
00:59:43.700 --> 00:59:45.290
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They never figured out who did it.</v>

1336
00:59:45.291 --> 00:59:47.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I still think it's the family.</v>

1337
00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:48.470
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody thinks it's the family,</v>

1338
00:59:48.471 --> 00:59:51.230
<v Speaker 3>but that's a fucking crazy indictment if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're wrong.</v>

1339
00:59:52.750 --> 00:59:55.570
<v Speaker 4>You bought that crazy conspiracy theory</v>
<v Speaker 4>the other day that they think there's,</v>

1340
00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:57.830
<v Speaker 4>the online world thinks there's some,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1341
00:59:58.510 --> 01:00:01.480
<v Speaker 4>crazy con,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a serial killer that's tied to this.</v>

1342
01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:03.610
<v Speaker 4>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They've linked him to that Jon Benet</v>

1343
01:00:03.610 --> 01:00:06.910
<v Speaker 4>Ramsey thing to the same serial killer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he's done these crazy stories that</v>

1344
01:00:06.911 --> 01:00:10.570
<v Speaker 4>have no explanation for who did what and</v>
<v Speaker 4>someone else's got blamed for it.</v>

1345
01:00:11.050 --> 01:00:12.400
<v Speaker 4>It's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a crazy story too,</v>

1346
01:00:12.401 --> 01:00:15.280
<v Speaker 4>but who knows if there's anything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>anything in there.</v>

1347
01:00:15.630 --> 01:00:16.620
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1348
01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:20.760
<v Speaker 3>I dunno man,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's the point being like if they</v>

1349
01:00:20.761 --> 01:00:24.330
<v Speaker 3>wanted to try to figure out who the</v>
<v Speaker 3>murderer was today,</v>

1350
01:00:25.110 --> 01:00:28.260
<v Speaker 3>you would have a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think with the evidence being</v>

1351
01:00:28.261 --> 01:00:29.190
<v Speaker 3>contaminated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1352
01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:30.870
<v Speaker 3>how much evidence they have.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What about there?</v>

1353
01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:35.790
<v Speaker 3>How long does the body last before you</v>
<v Speaker 3>can zoom it and examine it?</v>

1354
01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:38.670
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what can you get from that?</v>

1355
01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:41.580
<v Speaker 3>Who the fuck knows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't have those answers.</v>

1356
01:00:41.610 --> 01:00:42.780
<v Speaker 3>Remember those Hbo Shows?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1357
01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:45.240
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the real autopsy series.</v>

1358
01:00:45.241 --> 01:00:46.320
<v Speaker 3>You can't watch it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>dude,</v>

1359
01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:49.940
<v Speaker 3>that guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that guy used to freak me out that</v>

1360
01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:52.260
<v Speaker 3>Michael Baden,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know that guy.</v>

1361
01:00:52.270 --> 01:00:53.170
<v Speaker 3>The autopsy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Got It.</v>

1362
01:00:53.180 --> 01:00:54.600
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I couldn't watch those shows,</v>

1363
01:00:54.601 --> 01:00:56.280
<v Speaker 3>but who,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not into that like,</v>

1364
01:00:56.290 --> 01:00:59.250
<v Speaker 3>like I do,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if we talked about this,</v>

1365
01:00:59.251 --> 01:01:03.240
<v Speaker 3>but there's like this bridge in Pasadena</v>
<v Speaker 3>called suicide bridge and it was made in</v>

1366
01:01:03.241 --> 01:01:06.270
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe the 30s and like people die</v>

1367
01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:09.440
<v Speaker 3>all the time off the spreads.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They just go there and kill themselves.</v>

1368
01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:14.480
<v Speaker 3>I know somebody that was hiking and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>was just hiking and there's this a girl</v>

1369
01:01:14.670 --> 01:01:16.110
<v Speaker 3>dead on the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the,</v>

1370
01:01:16.140 --> 01:01:18.780
<v Speaker 3>on the trail because there's like a</v>
<v Speaker 3>trail that goes on the bottom of it.</v>

1371
01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:20.430
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then somebody told me,</v>

1372
01:01:20.431 --> 01:01:22.680
<v Speaker 3>I know if this is true,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but somebody told me that like when they</v>

1373
01:01:22.681 --> 01:01:26.550
<v Speaker 3>have huge rain storms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that all these bones just kind of washed</v>

1374
01:01:26.551 --> 01:01:28.800
<v Speaker 3>down from this big or that sounds like</v>
<v Speaker 3>some skin.</v>

1375
01:01:29.780 --> 01:01:30.613
<v Speaker 3>Oh.</v>

1376
01:01:32.150 --> 01:01:35.310
<v Speaker 3>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is the balls down the mountain.</v>

1377
01:01:35.311 --> 01:01:39.390
<v Speaker 3>And then like in the trail that you just</v>
<v Speaker 3>like see like little bone here and there</v>

1378
01:01:39.391 --> 01:01:40.224
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1379
01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:45.210
<v Speaker 3>from bodies that like jumped and were</v>
<v Speaker 3>never found in this side of this.</v>

1380
01:01:45.330 --> 01:01:47.760
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's that many people have done it.</v>

1381
01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:48.960
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's totally,</v>

1382
01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:51.600
<v Speaker 3>it's not like they're going to do a</v>
<v Speaker 3>thorough job of cleaning you if he</v>

1383
01:01:51.601 --> 01:01:54.030
<v Speaker 3>jumped off a bridge and splatter all</v>

<v Speaker 4>trigger and done that.</v>

1470
01:05:33.060 --> 01:05:34.390
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's like Mush,</v>

1471
01:05:34.450 --> 01:05:36.640
<v Speaker 3>like mushrooms times five.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It used to be,</v>

1472
01:05:36.641 --> 01:05:39.970
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if it's the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My friend just did a payoti ceremony.</v>

1473
01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:42.100
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hollow and native American.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Would you ever do the,</v>

1475
01:05:45.310 --> 01:05:49.300
<v Speaker 3>here's the problem with ceremonies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you doing them with a bunch of people</v>

1476
01:05:49.301 --> 01:05:51.540
<v Speaker 3>who don't even know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there were some times she gets</v>

1477
01:05:51.550 --> 01:05:53.950
<v Speaker 3>around,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we're just going to freak out.</v>

1478
01:05:54.660 --> 01:05:56.390
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when you want to do your payoti manage,</v>

1479
01:05:56.410 --> 01:06:00.370
<v Speaker 3>probably be alone or be with someone you</v>
<v Speaker 3>trust.</v>

1480
01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:01.870
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1481
01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:05.530
<v Speaker 3>if you get lucky and catch a good group,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you might have to Tom your life at a</v>

1482
01:06:05.531 --> 01:06:06.520
<v Speaker 3>payload,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a ceremony,</v>

1483
01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:08.260
<v Speaker 3>or you could,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1484
01:06:08.590 --> 01:06:11.470
<v Speaker 3>you could just be hanging out with</v>
<v Speaker 3>people who are completely out of their</v>

1485
01:06:11.471 --> 01:06:13.660
<v Speaker 3>fucking mind and also do drugs.</v>

1486
01:06:13.870 --> 01:06:16.210
<v Speaker 3>That's possible too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't have any control.</v>

1487
01:06:16.570 --> 01:06:19.150
<v Speaker 3>You're just guessing whether or not this</v>
<v Speaker 3>is going to make sense.</v>

1488
01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:21.633
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thank you.</v>

1489
01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:24.160
<v Speaker 3>I think pay is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's the one where you puke all the</v>

1490
01:06:24.161 --> 01:06:26.020
<v Speaker 3>time and then the last days or</v>
<v Speaker 3>something,</v>

1491
01:06:26.030 --> 01:06:26.360
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You,</v>

1492
01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:27.640
<v Speaker 3>it is a tricky one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

1493
01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.770
<v Speaker 3>It's some sort of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

1494
01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:32.800
<v Speaker 3>like it's from a Cactus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1495
01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.670
<v Speaker 3>And there's another drug that's just</v>
<v Speaker 3>like pod that's also from a cactus that</v>

1496
01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:37.533
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>

1497
01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:40.960
<v Speaker 3>that I think you can also get similar</v>
<v Speaker 3>effects from it.</v>

1498
01:06:40.961 --> 01:06:44.680
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember the name of the Cactus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I guess in Mexico it's,</v>

1499
01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:48.100
<v Speaker 3>you can find them all over the place.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a movie about,</v>

1500
01:06:48.570 --> 01:06:50.380
<v Speaker 3>about it too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget the name of the movie,</v>

1501
01:06:50.381 --> 01:06:52.780
<v Speaker 3>but there's a movie about this guy</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's just trying to get this cactus</v>

1502
01:06:52.781 --> 01:06:55.390
<v Speaker 3>and trip on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I forget what is the active ingredient</v>

1503
01:06:55.391 --> 01:06:56.224
<v Speaker 3>pot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1504
01:06:56.230 --> 01:07:00.400
<v Speaker 3>Isn't there a masculine mask?</v>
<v Speaker 3>When I was in high school,</v>

1505
01:07:00.401 --> 01:07:02.000
<v Speaker 3>it was mask.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I was,</v>

1506
01:07:02.170 --> 01:07:06.160
<v Speaker 3>the kid dropped two hits a mask and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd say Mush Mush.</v>

1507
01:07:06.161 --> 01:07:07.750
<v Speaker 3>The kid dropped two hits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a mask.</v>

1508
01:07:07.751 --> 01:07:12.060
<v Speaker 3>He was fucked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I remember like dropping Maskelyne</v>

1509
01:07:12.061 --> 01:07:14.650
<v Speaker 3>like people would talk about dropping</v>
<v Speaker 3>mask and I'd be like,</v>

1510
01:07:14.651 --> 01:07:18.470
<v Speaker 3>you gotta be out of your fucking mind.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's no way you people,</v>

1512
01:07:23.290 --> 01:07:24.460
<v Speaker 3>eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>seventies that it seems like people used</v>

<v Speaker 3>Like that don't exist in like masculine.</v>

1523
01:07:57.911 --> 01:07:59.950

<v Speaker 3>today that are red.</v>

1525
01:08:02.711 --> 01:08:07.711
<v Speaker 3>They were saying that the one of the key</v>
<v Speaker 3>witnesses doesn't think that it's legal</v>

1526
01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:09.550
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

<v Speaker 3>to prosecute based on the deal that</v>
<v Speaker 3>cosby got back down.</v>

1528
01:08:13.811 --> 01:08:15.980
<v Speaker 3>I think that's Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he made</v>

1529
01:08:15.980 --> 01:08:17.090
<v Speaker 1>a deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1530
01:08:17.750 --> 01:08:18.410
<v Speaker 1>I heard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1531
01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:23.410
<v Speaker 2>That it was that bill cosby was about to</v>
<v Speaker 2>buy NBC and I earned the Illuminati.</v>

1532
01:08:24.910 --> 01:08:25.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1533
01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:29.050
<v Speaker 1>Illuminati.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't try to take him down,</v>

1534
01:08:29.051 --> 01:08:31.840
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've heard that too.</v>

1535
01:08:31.870 --> 01:08:32.950
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where did I read that?</v>

1536
01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:34.930
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1537
01:08:34.930 --> 01:08:39.850
<v Speaker 1>so this guy was essentially saying that</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not on bill cosby side,</v>

1538
01:08:39.910 --> 01:08:43.780
<v Speaker 1>but the actual law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way the law is written,</v>

1539
01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:48.510
<v Speaker 1>he gave them some sort of a deal in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

1540
01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:51.690
<v Speaker 1>though the reason why he was willing to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1541
01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:54.580
<v Speaker 1>give out the statement that he made,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1542
01:08:54.581 --> 01:08:57.010
<v Speaker 1>what's that called?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Declaration or whatever the fuck it is</v>

1543
01:08:57.011 --> 01:08:57.870
<v Speaker 1>when they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you're,</v>

1544
01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:59.260
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

1545
01:08:59.350 --> 01:09:00.580
<v Speaker 1>in court,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>

1546
01:09:00.610 --> 01:09:04.570
<v Speaker 1>he deposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he was willing to do the deposition</v>

1547
01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:08.650
<v Speaker 1>based on the fact that he couldn't get</v>
<v Speaker 1>prosecuted,</v>

1548
01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:12.220
<v Speaker 1>prosecuted for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now that they want to prosecute him</v>

1549
01:09:12.221 --> 01:09:16.720
<v Speaker 1>for the same case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy thinks that that is not legal.</v>

1550
01:09:17.410 --> 01:09:19.500
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How old evidence about,</v>

1551
01:09:20.310 --> 01:09:21.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1552
01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:24.390
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about the same case just</v>

1553
01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:27.310
<v Speaker 1>because there's so many cases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1554
01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:30.070
<v Speaker 1>It's another smoke and fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a,</v>

1555
01:09:30.071 --> 01:09:34.660
<v Speaker 1>that's a terrifying one though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this guy was doing that to people.</v>

1556
01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:37.540
<v Speaker 1>We all know that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People like that though.</v>

1557
01:09:39.870 --> 01:09:42.110
<v Speaker 1>Just unfortunately dps guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1558
01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:44.170
<v Speaker 1>but that's such a deep level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1559
01:09:44.590 --> 01:09:49.050
<v Speaker 1>That's such a scary level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scary level of a tattooed cause.</v>

1560
01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:50.230
<v Speaker 1>The scariest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

1561
01:09:50.231 --> 01:09:51.970
<v Speaker 1>you're watching,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at people lying</v>

1562
01:09:51.971 --> 01:09:54.160
<v Speaker 1>unconscious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1563
01:09:54.550 --> 01:09:57.760
<v Speaker 1>and then you're fucking them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it lying on conscious or just not</v>

1564
01:09:57.761 --> 01:10:01.570
<v Speaker 1>remembering is lacking out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

1565
01:10:01.571 --> 01:10:02.950
<v Speaker 1>Man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1566
01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:05.220
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of them are saying it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>blacking out.</v>

1567
01:10:05.470 --> 01:10:06.303
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

1568
01:10:06.310 --> 01:10:10.750
<v Speaker 1>the trauma of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You imagine if you just thought that guy</v>

1569
01:10:10.751 --> 01:10:13.600
<v Speaker 1>was really cool and you want her to hang</v>
<v Speaker 1>out with them and you woke up with one,</v>

1570
01:10:14.170 --> 01:10:16.990
<v Speaker 1>one shoe on and your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your panties are down by your ankles and</v>

1571
01:10:16.991 --> 01:10:18.850
<v Speaker 1>you realize what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>

1572
01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:21.430
<v Speaker 1>and you don't even know what to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1573
01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:23.440
<v Speaker 1>You don't even know what to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>

1574
01:10:23.441 --> 01:10:25.210
<v Speaker 1>what happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>

1575
01:10:26.770 --> 01:10:30.310
<v Speaker 1>And especially if you're drinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>together and you're having fun having a</v>

1576
01:10:30.311 --> 01:10:33.010
<v Speaker 1>couple of cocktails,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't think anything's going wrong.</v>

1577
01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:37.730
<v Speaker 2>I this diet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now I have one drink,</v>

1578
01:10:37.731 --> 01:10:39.620
<v Speaker 2>I'm wasted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1579
01:10:39.650 --> 01:10:41.720
<v Speaker 2>the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>luckily I didn't drive.</v>

1580
01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:46.730
<v Speaker 2>The other day I had like two or three</v>
<v Speaker 2>drinks and Black Super Bravo blackout.</v>

1581
01:10:46.750 --> 01:10:49.160
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like I had no idea how I got home.</v>

1582
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:51.260
<v Speaker 2>I did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It had no idea I would like anything</v>

1583
01:10:51.261 --> 01:10:54.710
<v Speaker 2>that happened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that Shit's scary because I existed</v>

1584
01:10:54.711 --> 01:10:57.410
<v Speaker 2>as a human for at least three to four</v>
<v Speaker 2>hours.</v>

1585
01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:00.320
<v Speaker 2>I even like I checked my phone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was texting people,</v>

1586
01:11:00.750 --> 01:11:03.690
<v Speaker 1>well they ciro honestly when you drink a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot that's,</v>

1587
01:11:03.870 --> 01:11:08.460
<v Speaker 1>it starts happening like later in your</v>
<v Speaker 1>life that like people that um,</v>

1588
01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:12.660
<v Speaker 1>are</v>
<v Speaker 1>there getting drunk like five,</v>

1589
01:11:12.661 --> 01:11:15.810
<v Speaker 1>six a week and I'm not saying you</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily wear,</v>

1590
01:11:16.050 --> 01:11:21.050
<v Speaker 1>but they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their tolerance starts to like drop off</v>

1591
01:11:21.330 --> 01:11:25.230
<v Speaker 1>their body's ability to fight it off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>starts to like drop off and the</v>

1592
01:11:25.231 --> 01:11:28.410
<v Speaker 1>propensity towards blackouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's when,</v>

1593
01:11:28.411 --> 01:11:30.750
<v Speaker 1>the way it's been explained to me by</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who had a problem with it,</v>

1594
01:11:31.530 --> 01:11:35.610
<v Speaker 1>that it gets to this point where it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like super common to blackout or it</v>

1595
01:11:35.611 --> 01:11:39.690
<v Speaker 1>didn't use to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it just wears on you over time.</v>

1596
01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:43.700
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely where I've been like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh I don't remember.</v>

1597
01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:46.890
<v Speaker 2>I talked to you last night and I like</v>
<v Speaker 2>that stuff but it's just like you</v>

1599
01:11:48.900 --> 01:11:52.530
<v Speaker 2>this is the first time I that I can</v>
<v Speaker 2>remember that it was so such a straight</v>

1600
01:11:52.531 --> 01:11:54.630
<v Speaker 2>blackout.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like I was freaked out.</v>

1601
01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:57.810
<v Speaker 2>Like I just sat there and it was just</v>
<v Speaker 2>trying to remember anything that</v>

1602
01:11:57.811 --> 01:12:00.810
<v Speaker 2>happened and like the last for four</v>
<v Speaker 2>hours or whatever,</v>

1603
01:12:00.811 --> 01:12:02.790
<v Speaker 2>cut to was my bathroom covered with</v>
<v Speaker 2>blood.</v>

<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

1605
01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:09.910
<v Speaker 1>Blackouts a terrifying because people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they black out and they get behind a</v>

1606
01:12:09.911 --> 01:12:10.870
<v Speaker 1>wheel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1607
01:12:11.350 --> 01:12:16.350

<v Speaker 1>that sells alcohol everywhere.</v>

1608
01:12:18.730 --> 01:12:22.810
<v Speaker 1>You can buy guns everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do all this crazy shit,</v>

1609
01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:27.730
<v Speaker 1>but you still can't openly by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd</v>

1610
01:12:29.470 --> 01:12:30.031
<v Speaker 1>like the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the,</v>

1611
01:12:30.031 --> 01:12:31.660
<v Speaker 1>as,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's going to be the tipping point</v>

1612
01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:34.630
<v Speaker 1>is if we just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole country just says,</v>

1613
01:12:34.690 --> 01:12:36.720
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's all just relax and,</v>

1614
01:12:37.230 --> 01:12:38.320
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to let it through.</v>

1615
01:12:39.790 --> 01:12:41.470
<v Speaker 1>Like as if that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would somehow another</v>

1616
01:12:43.090 --> 01:12:46.780
<v Speaker 1>make this whole thing fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

1617
01:12:46.781 --> 01:12:47.300
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

1618
01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:47.940
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

1619
01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:48.631
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

1620
01:12:48.631 --> 01:12:50.280
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole marijuana thing recently,</v>

1621
01:12:50.281 --> 01:12:51.610
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1622
01:12:52.110 --> 01:12:54.300
<v Speaker 2>I keep on forgetting that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's illegal.</v>

1623
01:12:55.790 --> 01:12:57.690
<v Speaker 2>Like about the other day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was just like,</v>

1624
01:12:57.691 --> 01:12:59.460
<v Speaker 2>I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

1625
01:12:59.670 --> 01:13:01.860
<v Speaker 2>this is actually illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What I'm doing right now.</v>

1626
01:13:01.861 --> 01:13:04.920
<v Speaker 2>You just kind of forget that marijuana</v>
<v Speaker 2>is still illegal.</v>

1627
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:05.581
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Brian,</v>

1628
01:13:05.581 --> 01:13:07.540
<v Speaker 2>you have a prescription,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1629
01:13:07.590 --> 01:13:12.060
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the number one thing that cops are</v>

1630
01:13:12.061 --> 01:13:17.061
<v Speaker 2>being trained for and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the work cases is marijuana duis</v>

1631
01:13:17.580 --> 01:13:18.420
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

1632
01:13:18.450 --> 01:13:19.283
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1633
01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:21.630
<v Speaker 2>like my friend's a lawyer and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1634
01:13:21.631 --> 01:13:25.440
<v Speaker 2>it's surpassing drunk driving now as far</v>
<v Speaker 2>as like the money,</v>

1635
01:13:25.830 --> 01:13:26.910
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just how many,</v>

1636
01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:28.250
<v Speaker 2>how many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1637
01:13:28.350 --> 01:13:33.350
<v Speaker 2>people they catch for marijuana duis and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's the same Dui driving under the</v>

1638
01:13:33.631 --> 01:13:36.090
<v Speaker 2>influence is the same as alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How do they prove it?</v>

1639
01:13:36.180 --> 01:13:39.840
<v Speaker 2>They have tests now that they can</v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately just test you and they're</v>

1640
01:13:39.841 --> 01:13:41.190
<v Speaker 2>not the most accurate.</v>

1641
01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:43.310
<v Speaker 2>So that's the only,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the only thing that the,</v>

1642
01:13:43.311 --> 01:13:45.720
<v Speaker 2>that you have going for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if they,</v>

1643
01:13:45.721 --> 01:13:49.380
<v Speaker 2>if they pull you over and there's smoke</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming out of your window or they see a</v>

1644
01:13:49.381 --> 01:13:50.340
<v Speaker 2>joint on you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1645
01:13:50.341 --> 01:13:52.170
<v Speaker 2>that just got burned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can,</v>

1646
01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:54.630
<v Speaker 2>they can,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can test you now and go,</v>

1647
01:13:54.631 --> 01:13:56.700
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have marijuana in your system.</v>

1648
01:13:56.790 --> 01:13:59.640
<v Speaker 2>You got a Dui.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No matter if you have a license,</v>

1649
01:13:59.641 --> 01:14:02.580
<v Speaker 2>no matter if you have anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's totally like one of those</v>

1650
01:14:02.581 --> 01:14:03.301
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And he's telling me,</v>

1651
01:14:03.301 --> 01:14:05.040
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she's just Christ.</v>

1652
01:14:05.041 --> 01:14:08.370
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like you don't think about that is still</v>

1653
01:14:08.430 --> 01:14:11.950
<v Speaker 2>illegal and if it wasn't</v>

1654
01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:13.480
<v Speaker 8>illegal,</v>
<v Speaker 8>okay,</v>

1655
01:14:13.481 --> 01:14:14.910
<v Speaker 8>let's just say it's legal,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

1656
01:14:15.250 --> 01:14:20.250
<v Speaker 8>I think we can all</v>
<v Speaker 8>point to like at least one or two people</v>

1657
01:14:20.681 --> 01:14:23.890
<v Speaker 8>that we know that probably shouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 8>drive high.</v>

1658
01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:25.750
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>yeah,</v>

1659
01:14:26.050 --> 01:14:27.790
<v Speaker 8>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So they're impaired,</v>

1660
01:14:28.090 --> 01:14:31.840
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>But it's a fucking way different kind of</v>

1661
01:14:31.841 --> 01:14:35.290
<v Speaker 8>impairment than the kind of impairment</v>
<v Speaker 8>that you would get from alcohol.</v>

1662
01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:39.940
<v Speaker 8>Like it's not like a muscular</v>
<v Speaker 8>coordination type of impairment.</v>

1663
01:14:39.970 --> 01:14:43.120
<v Speaker 8>It's a different impairment.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's like a judgment impairment perhaps</v>

1664
01:14:43.150 --> 01:14:48.080
<v Speaker 8>or just freak out the anxiety like that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that kind of impairment and the</v>

1665
01:14:48.100 --> 01:14:50.890
<v Speaker 8>inability to recognize when to merge</v>
<v Speaker 8>when not the merge.</v>

1666
01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:51.940
<v Speaker 8>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm fucking freaking out,</v>

1667
01:14:51.941 --> 01:14:53.950
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That could happen for sure.</v>

1668
01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:58.150
<v Speaker 8>That can definitely happen and that</v>
<v Speaker 8>should be taken into consideration</v>

1669
01:14:58.151 --> 01:14:59.800
<v Speaker 8>whenever you make it legal to do</v>
<v Speaker 8>anything.</v>

1670
01:14:59.801 --> 01:15:04.480
<v Speaker 8>We agree that it's all legal to drink</v>
<v Speaker 8>caffeine and getting your car.</v>

1671
01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:06.340
<v Speaker 8>We all agree that it's speed.</v>

1672
01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:09.550
<v Speaker 8>You could have a monster energy drink</v>
<v Speaker 8>sitting in your cup holder when a cop</v>

1673
01:15:09.551 --> 01:15:11.290
<v Speaker 8>pulls you over.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's math,</v>

1674
01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:13.780
<v Speaker 8>man.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's an awesome math.</v>

1675
01:15:13.781 --> 01:15:16.510
<v Speaker 8>It's delicious,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it's obviously not math,</v>

1676
01:15:16.570 --> 01:15:18.940
<v Speaker 8>but it's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's like probably like how much</v>

1677
01:15:18.941 --> 01:15:21.340
<v Speaker 8>caffeine is in one of those monster</v>
<v Speaker 8>energy drinks</v>

1678
01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:24.340
<v Speaker 8>a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Dude.</v>

1679
01:15:24.341 --> 01:15:26.800
<v Speaker 8>Those things,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if you don't want to play games,</v>

1680
01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:31.090
<v Speaker 8>if you want to just kick crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 8>just chug one of those big ones.</v>

1681
01:15:31.330 --> 01:15:35.320
<v Speaker 8>Like the ones that looked like a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the lemonade cancels giant lemonade cans</v>

1682
01:15:35.410 --> 01:15:37.450
<v Speaker 8>like chuck,</v>
<v Speaker 8>one of those fucking things.</v>

1683
01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:40.450
<v Speaker 8>Monster energy drink those big giant</v>
<v Speaker 8>tall boys.</v>

1684
01:15:41.230 --> 01:15:43.840
<v Speaker 8>Those things are ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Not that much.</v>

1685
01:15:44.220 --> 01:15:47.670
<v Speaker 4>Really says it says 160 milligrams per</v>
<v Speaker 4>16 ounce cane.</v>

1686
01:15:47.870 --> 01:15:49.260
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What about starbucks?</v>

1687
01:15:49.640 --> 01:15:50.580
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1688
01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:54.120
<v Speaker 4>So what else is in there that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>well there's probably a lot of sugar for</v>

1689
01:15:54.121 --> 01:15:54.954
<v Speaker 4>sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fuck.</v>

1690
01:15:56.790 --> 01:15:59.040
<v Speaker 4>What about sugar free?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The will have sugar free ones.</v>

1691
01:15:59.310 --> 01:16:01.200
<v Speaker 4>That's interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would've thought it was way more.</v>

1692
01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:02.610
<v Speaker 4>I was going to add to what you're just</v>
<v Speaker 4>saying though,</v>

1693
01:16:02.611 --> 01:16:05.280
<v Speaker 4>but there's a certain amount of people</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know that shouldn't be driving</v>

1694
01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:06.860
<v Speaker 4>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even when they're stone sober.</v>

1695
01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:09.660
<v Speaker 4>They just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they can't handle all the inputs.</v>

1696
01:16:09.750 --> 01:16:14.230
<v Speaker 8>We have a winner,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Jamie van and with a,</v>

1699
01:16:16.310 --> 01:16:19.280
<v Speaker 4>that I'm sure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think she knows she's driving</v>

1700
01:16:19.281 --> 01:16:20.930
<v Speaker 4>when she's driving.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know what I mean?</v>

1701
01:16:20.931 --> 01:16:22.310

<v Speaker 8>like</v>

1720
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:15.550
<v Speaker 1>just a super hard introspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>objective view of life and death and the</v>

1721
01:17:19.731 --> 01:17:24.731
<v Speaker 1>cycle of things and the son running out</v>
<v Speaker 1>of fuel eventually.</v>

1722
01:17:25.011 --> 01:17:28.010
<v Speaker 1>This is planet no longer being viable</v>
<v Speaker 1>for life,</v>

1731
01:17:48.111 --> 01:17:51.800
<v Speaker 1>we try to figure out what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a quick flash,</v>

1732
01:17:51.801 --> 01:17:55.280
<v Speaker 1>it's happening right in front of our</v>
<v Speaker 1>faces and we're living it and while</v>

1733
01:17:55.281 --> 01:17:56.150
<v Speaker 1>we're living it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going,</v>

1736
01:18:02.091 --> 01:18:04.670
<v Speaker 1>sleeping and eating and fucking and</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to the movies.</v>

1737
01:18:04.671 --> 01:18:05.570
<v Speaker 1>But what are we doing?</v>

1738

<v Speaker 1>What is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this race?</v>

1739
01:18:07.881 --> 01:18:11.600
<v Speaker 1>What does this race of people doing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does this weird thing that only has</v>

1740
01:18:11.601 --> 01:18:15.020
<v Speaker 1>a hundred years of life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just starts to figure out the how</v>

1741
01:18:15.021 --> 01:18:20.021
<v Speaker 1>bizarre and weird this whole thing is</v>
<v Speaker 1>before it's snuffed out and the new</v>

1742
01:18:20.661 --> 01:18:24.860
<v Speaker 1>ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're similarly short lifespan</v>

1743
01:18:25.130 --> 01:18:28.340
<v Speaker 1>benefit from all the information passed</v>
<v Speaker 1>on by the ones before them,</v>

1744
01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:31.190
<v Speaker 1>but still go through life like it's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dream.</v>

1745
01:18:31.191 --> 01:18:34.110
<v Speaker 1>Still do everything you do and thank</v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What,</v>

1747
01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:38.690
<v Speaker 1>what is this life like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does the sky,</v>

1748
01:18:38.691 --> 01:18:43.130
<v Speaker 1>what is this infinity above my head that</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one talks about every day?</v>

1749
01:18:43.131 --> 01:18:45.170
<v Speaker 1>Infinity is above your head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>

1750
01:18:45.171 --> 01:18:47.830
<v Speaker 1>You pull the visor down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put your fucking shades og.</v>

1751
01:18:47.831 --> 01:18:48.664
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fucking,</v>

1752
01:18:48.790 --> 01:18:49.740
<v Speaker 1>it's so bright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

1753
01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:53.750
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're looking at the reflection of the</v>

1754
01:18:53.751 --> 01:18:58.751
<v Speaker 1>sun off gases in the atmosphere above</v>
<v Speaker 1>your head that you need to sustain life</v>

1755
01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:03.350
<v Speaker 1>and we're just so used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're doing it.</v>

1756
01:19:03.351 --> 01:19:08.351
<v Speaker 1>Think of it as interesting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It takes a hundred years to stop you.</v>

1757
01:19:10.010 --> 01:19:12.770
<v Speaker 1>You could do your best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you hit a hundred years.</v>

1758
01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:15.590
<v Speaker 1>It's over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not enough time.</v>

1759
01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:19.580
<v Speaker 1>She just just start,</v>
<v Speaker 1>start to recognize the hustle as you get</v>

1760
01:19:19.581 --> 01:19:20.414
<v Speaker 1>older,</v>

1761
01:19:20.750 --> 01:19:22.400
<v Speaker 8>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think,</v>

1762
01:19:22.730 --> 01:19:25.220
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>if you had kids today,</v>

1763
01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:29.300
<v Speaker 8>I think there a little bit luckier</v>
<v Speaker 8>because I feel like we're on the cuff of</v>

1764
01:19:29.301 --> 01:19:31.370
<v Speaker 8>being able to download us,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1765
01:19:31.610 --> 01:19:35.900
<v Speaker 8>very seren and I don't think it might,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we might miss it just probably like a</v>

1766
01:19:35.900 --> 01:19:38.600
<v Speaker 8>couple of years.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think we will become incredibly</v>

1767
01:19:38.601 --> 01:19:41.870
<v Speaker 8>annoying spammers of ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's what we're going to do.</v>

1768
01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:43.370
<v Speaker 8>We're going to be able to download</v>
<v Speaker 8>ourselves.</v>

1769
01:19:43.410 --> 01:19:46.640
<v Speaker 8>Then we're just going to fucking shoot</v>
<v Speaker 8>ourselves in the bit torrent and mega</v>

1770
01:19:46.641 --> 01:19:48.800
<v Speaker 8>upload.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We're going to put ourselves everywhere.</v>

1771
01:19:48.801 --> 01:19:50.600
<v Speaker 8>Like I want to go everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I want to go to fucking Europe,</v>

1772
01:19:50.601 --> 01:19:53.690
<v Speaker 8>I want to be in Turkey and there'd be</v>
<v Speaker 8>doubles and triples of people all</v>

1773
01:19:53.691 --> 01:19:57.700
<v Speaker 8>throughout the the this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>this artificial world that we've created</v>

1774
01:19:57.701 --> 01:20:00.350
<v Speaker 8>of hyperspace.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We're going to have like a hyperspace</v>

1775
01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:05.360
<v Speaker 8>cloud drive of humanity that's going to</v>
<v Speaker 8>be just as fucking crowded as earth and</v>

1776
01:20:05.601 --> 01:20:06.620
<v Speaker 8>we're going to go,</v>
<v Speaker 8>shit,</v>

1777
01:20:06.621 --> 01:20:11.400
<v Speaker 8>we don't have hard drive space in the</v>
<v Speaker 8>fucking cloud and these assholes keep</v>

1778
01:20:11.401 --> 01:20:13.920
<v Speaker 8>copying themselves cause they want to be</v>
<v Speaker 8>a mortal.</v>

1779
01:20:14.010 --> 01:20:18.360
<v Speaker 8>So like rich guys would have like a</v>
<v Speaker 8>cloud serve reflect 200 trillion</v>

1780
01:20:18.361 --> 01:20:22.110
<v Speaker 8>terabytes and it would just be filled</v>
<v Speaker 8>with copies of themselves and then they</v>

1781
01:20:22.111 --> 01:20:24.840
<v Speaker 8>would just send out fucking like fake</v>
<v Speaker 8>emails,</v>

<v Speaker 8>Click here to see some Dick.</v>

1788
01:20:35.981 --> 01:20:38.840
<v Speaker 4>your cars.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your car has your brain in all your,</v>

1789
01:20:38.841 --> 01:20:42.910
<v Speaker 4>your past and all your memories,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but your cars talking to you and it's</v>

1790
01:20:42.911 --> 01:20:44.350
<v Speaker 4>due.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like you're my bro</v>

1791
01:20:46.060 --> 01:20:51.060
<v Speaker 8>to imagine if they figure out a way to</v>
<v Speaker 8>not just download your consciousness but</v>

1792
01:20:53.911 --> 01:20:55.800
<v Speaker 8>take parts out you don't need.</v>

1795
01:21:02.701 --> 01:21:04.710
<v Speaker 8>compliant.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We figured out a way to isolate the ego.</v>

1796
01:21:04.711 --> 01:21:08.130
<v Speaker 8>We're going to remove it and we're going</v>
<v Speaker 8>to put this brain in cars.</v>

<v Speaker 8>your car.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like your car has to be completely</v>

1802

01:21:33.300 --> 01:21:35.160
<v Speaker 8>And the car thinks it's you.</v>

<v Speaker 8>to recreate like a celebrity and some</v>

1840
01:22:54.781 --> 01:22:57.210
<v Speaker 8>sort of an artificial life that will</v>
<v Speaker 8>have sex with you,</v>

1841
01:22:57.730 --> 01:23:00.450
<v Speaker 8>that you could do that?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like you could make your own,</v>

1842
01:23:01.260 --> 01:23:02.520
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>fill in the blank.</v>

1843
01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:04.620
<v Speaker 8>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you could make your own.</v>

1844
01:23:04.650 --> 01:23:05.710
<v Speaker 8>Hillary swank</v>

1845
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:11.070
<v Speaker 1>maybe got a hilary swank fetish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could literally have a robot sex</v>

1846
01:23:11.111 --> 01:23:15.640
<v Speaker 1>doll that is her right like it is her.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you become Mike,</v>

1847
01:23:15.641 --> 01:23:19.040
<v Speaker 1>some super billionaire Donald Trump type</v>
<v Speaker 1>character and you've got long paper and</v>

1848
01:23:19.041 --> 01:23:21.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm saying that guy could,</v>

1849
01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:24.400
<v Speaker 1>he has the cash or one of those things</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they,</v>

1850
01:23:24.460 --> 01:23:27.010
<v Speaker 1>when they first start get designed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he could do that.</v>

1851
01:23:27.520 --> 01:23:30.010
<v Speaker 1>He could do whatever he wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can make like this.</v>

1852
01:23:30.011 --> 01:23:32.080
<v Speaker 1>We're going to get there within the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next,</v>

1853
01:23:32.110 --> 01:23:35.530
<v Speaker 1>I'd say a hundred years where they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have these artificial people</v>

1854
01:23:35.590 --> 01:23:37.910
<v Speaker 1>that you can have sex with that or</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not going to be able to,</v>

1855
01:23:38.060 --> 01:23:39.610
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be like blade runner</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

1856
01:23:39.930 --> 01:23:42.480
<v Speaker 4>You're starting to describe an episode</v>
<v Speaker 4>of Black Mirror that you haven't seen</v>

1857
01:23:42.481 --> 01:23:45.390
<v Speaker 4>yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Listen,</v>

1858
01:23:45.391 --> 01:23:46.800
<v Speaker 4>folks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>swear to God.</v>

1859
01:23:46.801 --> 01:23:48.990
<v Speaker 4>I haven't seen that show.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not stealing.</v>

1860
01:23:49.670 --> 01:23:51.180
<v Speaker 4>It's so weird.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1861
01:23:51.181 --> 01:23:53.100
<v Speaker 4>I have to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I only saw the pig fucker one.</v>

1862
01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:55.470
<v Speaker 4>It was good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I liked talking about the really cool,</v>

1863
01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:59.880
<v Speaker 4>interesting idea and the way they like</v>
<v Speaker 4>show you how it works is cool.</v>

1864
01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:02.040
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I need to say they're starting it up</v>

1865
01:24:02.041 --> 01:24:04.080
<v Speaker 4>again too.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think it's coming up while Netflix,</v>

1866
01:24:04.140 --> 01:24:07.530
<v Speaker 4>there's only at their six and then</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's like a special Christmas when</v>

1867
01:24:07.531 --> 01:24:09.270
<v Speaker 4>they made a little after and now they're</v>
<v Speaker 4>going to start some more.</v>

1868
01:24:09.300 --> 01:24:10.560
<v Speaker 4>What's the name of the one I need to</v>
<v Speaker 4>see?</v>

1869
01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:12.270
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the name of it.</v>

1870
01:24:12.450 --> 01:24:14.310
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I said,</v>

1871
01:24:14.311 --> 01:24:15.720
<v Speaker 4>there's only six of them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so,</v>

1872
01:24:16.030 --> 01:24:17.700
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not that hard to find it.</v>

1873
01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:20.000
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dammit.</v>

1874
01:24:20.040 --> 01:24:21.300
<v Speaker 1>I had the picture of it here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Business here,</v>

1875
01:24:21.301 --> 01:24:26.250
<v Speaker 1>the name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's totally possible that we're</v>

1876
01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:31.320
<v Speaker 1>gonna be able to replicate what we are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might not happen in our lifetime or</v>

1877
01:24:32.461 --> 01:24:35.040
<v Speaker 1>even our children's lifetime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it just seems to me that they just</v>

1878
01:24:35.041 --> 01:24:40.041
<v Speaker 1>keep getting better and better at fic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fixing things and using like Willie</v>

1879
01:24:40.110 --> 01:24:42.480
<v Speaker 1>Nelson just had a stem cell operation to</v>
<v Speaker 1>fix his lungs.</v>

1880
01:24:42.690 --> 01:24:44.940
<v Speaker 1>Willie fucking Nelson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

1881
01:24:45.810 --> 01:24:46.643
<v Speaker 1>Do you think</v>

1882
01:24:46.910 --> 01:24:50.470
<v Speaker 4>like Obama recently said something about</v>
<v Speaker 4>how he's putting out,</v>

1883
01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:53.620
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>putting an end to cancer and into</v>

1884
01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:55.260
<v Speaker 4>cancer?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1885
01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:56.780
<v Speaker 4>like he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like we're,</v>

1886
01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:00.600
<v Speaker 4>we are going to solve this shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like he was kind of weird cause it's</v>

1887
01:25:00.601 --> 01:25:01.170
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh yeah,</v>

1888
01:25:01.170 --> 01:25:03.780
<v Speaker 4>no one's talked about cancer recently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why is that not cured?</v>

1889
01:25:03.781 --> 01:25:06.180
<v Speaker 4>Because they don't want it to let us</v>
<v Speaker 4>know that the Zika virus cause it's</v>

1890
01:25:06.181 --> 01:25:07.140
<v Speaker 4>coming.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1891
01:25:07.320 --> 01:25:09.660
<v Speaker 4>Sounds like an old school,</v>
<v Speaker 4>high school football coach and it's</v>

1892
01:25:09.661 --> 01:25:14.490
<v Speaker 4>ready to fuck up the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Does Zika virus the second though?</v>

1893
01:25:14.491 --> 01:25:17.820
<v Speaker 4>You can cure cancer by taking a shot or</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever.</v>

1894
01:25:17.821 --> 01:25:20.520
<v Speaker 4>Eating a pill.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you think cigarettes smoking?</v>

1895
01:25:20.521 --> 01:25:24.990
<v Speaker 4>We'll come back and I think everybody</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's been bitching about it and it's</v>

1896
01:25:24.991 --> 01:25:26.600
<v Speaker 4>all everyone's just gonna start smoking.</v>

1897
01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:28.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they figured out a way,</v>

1898
01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:30.750
<v Speaker 1>well listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's super possible.</v>

1899
01:25:30.810 --> 01:25:34.470
<v Speaker 1>They're going to be able to figure out a</v>
<v Speaker 1>way to make tissue healthier than it is</v>

1900
01:25:34.471 --> 01:25:35.460
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1901
01:25:35.520 --> 01:25:36.870
<v Speaker 1>This for how long?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How,</v>

1902
01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:38.790
<v Speaker 1>what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what at what price do you pay?</v>

1903
01:25:38.791 --> 01:25:42.300
<v Speaker 1>You're always gonna pay a price if you</v>
<v Speaker 1>use something abrasive on your lungs,</v>

1904
01:25:42.301 --> 01:25:44.400
<v Speaker 1>like cigarette smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like even joints.</v>

1905
01:25:44.401 --> 01:25:48.510
<v Speaker 1>I've got to imagine that if you're like</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those hardened leather lung hash</v>

1906
01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:50.900
<v Speaker 1>hash heads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's just dude,</v>

1907
01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:56.080
<v Speaker 1>just constantly dabbing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just gotta think that there's gotta be</v>

1908
01:25:56.401 --> 01:26:01.401
<v Speaker 1>at least some irritation of your lungs</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the hot smoke.</v>

1909
01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:04.130
<v Speaker 1>Just some vaporizers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None.</v>

1910
01:26:04.340 --> 01:26:09.340
<v Speaker 1>Vaporizer doesn't do any of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I would think that just smoke in</v>

1911
01:26:09.411 --> 01:26:12.140
<v Speaker 1>general is not the best idea for you to</v>
<v Speaker 1>take in.</v>

1912
01:26:12.590 --> 01:26:16.100
<v Speaker 1>But so cigarette smoke is real bad</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there's all these chemicals so</v>

1913
01:26:16.101 --> 01:26:20.000
<v Speaker 1>they might be able to figure out</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that can regenerate healthy</v>

1914
01:26:20.001 --> 01:26:23.360
<v Speaker 1>tissue and get rid of the bad tissue you</v>
<v Speaker 1>that maybe they could give you some sort</v>

1915
01:26:23.361 --> 01:26:24.920
<v Speaker 1>of a flush,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1916
01:26:24.921 --> 01:26:28.010
<v Speaker 1>whether it would fill your lungs up with</v>
<v Speaker 1>something and it would just eradicate</v>

1917
01:26:28.011 --> 01:26:28.970
<v Speaker 1>all the bad tissue.</v>

1918
01:26:28.970 --> 01:26:31.760
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'll figure it out though,</v>

1919
01:26:31.761 --> 01:26:33.290
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever it is,</v>

1920
01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:36.290
<v Speaker 1>they'll fix everything we're going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be so many people.</v>

1921
01:26:36.980 --> 01:26:39.590
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be such a problem because</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be able to fix</v>

1922
01:26:39.591 --> 01:26:42.890
<v Speaker 1>everything within like another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many?</v>

1923
01:26:42.940 --> 01:26:43.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

1924
01:26:43.180 --> 01:26:44.013
<v Speaker 1>let me make a guess</v>

1925
01:26:44.280 --> 01:26:47.230
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Totally unqualified guesses.</v>

1926
01:26:47.260 --> 01:26:49.750
<v Speaker 4>That's why airplanes do I have ashtrays</v>
<v Speaker 4>cause they're like waiting for it to</v>

1927
01:26:49.751 --> 01:26:50.584
<v Speaker 4>come back.</v>

1928
01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:55.440
<v Speaker 1>Airplane's still have ash trays just for</v>
<v Speaker 1>nostalgia sake.</v>

1929
01:26:56.260 --> 01:26:58.480
<v Speaker 4>You think they don't have the new ones</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't.</v>

1930
01:26:58.750 --> 01:27:00.850
<v Speaker 4>Some new ones do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And the haven put him in the bath.</v>

1931
01:27:00.851 --> 01:27:02.980
<v Speaker 4>They put them in that bathroom and</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're going to smoke.</v>

1932
01:27:02.981 --> 01:27:05.320
<v Speaker 4>They want you to be able to put it out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What?</v>

1933
01:27:05.440 --> 01:27:06.670
<v Speaker 4>They don't want you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There was no country.</v>

1934
01:27:06.671 --> 01:27:08.320
<v Speaker 4>You can still do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not like it's just an American</v>

1935
01:27:08.321 --> 01:27:08.760
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>

1936
01:27:08.760 --> 01:27:09.730
<v Speaker 4>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know.</v>

1937
01:27:09.731 --> 01:27:11.380
<v Speaker 4>That's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is that true?</v>

1938
01:27:11.980 --> 01:27:12.820
<v Speaker 4>I bet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I bet.</v>

1939
01:27:12.821 --> 01:27:15.020
<v Speaker 4>And Vietnam or some shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1940
01:27:15.610 --> 01:27:17.910
<v Speaker 4>Get out and play with it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1941
01:27:17.980 --> 01:27:18.960
<v Speaker 4>With one of those,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

1942
01:27:19.030 --> 01:27:21.670
<v Speaker 4>fat stogies off flights in Philly or</v>
<v Speaker 4>something.</v>

1943
01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:26.080
<v Speaker 4>Do you remember,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you remember cigarettes on planes?</v>

1944
01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:27.273
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

1945
01:27:28.170 --> 01:27:28.660
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1946
01:27:28.660 --> 01:27:30.200
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I went,</v>

1947
01:27:30.240 --> 01:27:33.960
<v Speaker 4>I went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I didn't fly until I was a freshman in</v>

1948
01:27:33.961 --> 01:27:37.950
<v Speaker 4>high school and my first time was flying</v>
<v Speaker 4>to Chicago and it was when aol first</v>

1949
01:27:37.951 --> 01:27:41.370
<v Speaker 4>came out and I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was the first girl I've ever met on</v>

1950
01:27:41.371 --> 01:27:44.250
<v Speaker 4>the computer and I met her in Chicago</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I took all these photos of her and I</v>

1951
01:27:44.251 --> 01:27:47.400
<v Speaker 4>found the camera the other day.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'd never got developed all these photos</v>

1952
01:27:48.050 --> 01:27:49.260
<v Speaker 4>that are on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I should do that.</v>

1953
01:27:49.890 --> 01:27:50.723
<v Speaker 4>But,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

1954
01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:53.110
<v Speaker 4>that was the first time I ever fly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fly,</v>

1955
01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:55.470
<v Speaker 4>fly them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was already passed a cigarette</v>

1956
01:27:55.471 --> 01:27:56.940
<v Speaker 4>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He used to be really strange.</v>

1957
01:27:57.440 --> 01:27:59.040
<v Speaker 4>They used to be this section.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sometimes the,</v>

1958
01:27:59.041 --> 01:28:01.920
<v Speaker 4>this is the only place you get a seat on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the plane was in that section,</v>

1959
01:28:02.340 --> 01:28:03.990
<v Speaker 4>so you'd have to be in the smoking</v>
<v Speaker 4>section.</v>

1960
01:28:04.020 --> 01:28:06.240
<v Speaker 4>It was like a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a hack joke,</v>

1961
01:28:06.241 --> 01:28:08.190
<v Speaker 4>like a reuse premise over and over</v>
<v Speaker 4>again.</v>

1962
01:28:08.610 --> 01:28:11.280
<v Speaker 1>The smoking section on a plane like a</v>
<v Speaker 1>dice.</v>

1963
01:28:11.281 --> 01:28:14.070
<v Speaker 1>Clay had the best take on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You in a fucking tube.</v>

1964
01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:16.140
<v Speaker 1>She's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're in a tube.</v>

1965
01:28:16.170 --> 01:28:17.640
<v Speaker 1>The fucking smokes go whenever.</v>

1966
01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:20.870
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's true.</v>

1967
01:28:21.140 --> 01:28:25.490
<v Speaker 4>It's the preposterous idea that you</v>
<v Speaker 4>could smoke in one area and it wouldn't</v>

1968
01:28:25.491 --> 01:28:28.460
<v Speaker 4>affect the rest of the plane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I just googled it.</v>

1969
01:28:28.610 --> 01:28:32.210
<v Speaker 4>Apparently there's still a rule in the</v>
<v Speaker 4>federal code of regulations that they</v>

1970
01:28:32.211 --> 01:28:36.020
<v Speaker 4>have to have an ashtray,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think it's a poll only because in</v>

1971
01:28:36.021 --> 01:28:41.021
<v Speaker 4>1973 a flight crashed and killed 123</v>
<v Speaker 4>people and they're attributed reason was</v>

1972
01:28:41.571 --> 01:28:43.850
<v Speaker 4>because of cigarette was improperly</v>
<v Speaker 4>disposed of.</v>

1973
01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:45.710
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Someone still asks.</v>

1974
01:28:45.711 --> 01:28:47.150
<v Speaker 4>The light went up because they break the</v>
<v Speaker 4>rule.</v>

1975
01:28:47.151 --> 01:28:48.740
<v Speaker 4>They still have to have somewhere to put</v>
<v Speaker 4>it out.</v>

1976
01:28:48.770 --> 01:28:49.610
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

1977
01:28:49.611 --> 01:28:53.480
<v Speaker 4>What a crazy concession to the most</v>
<v Speaker 4>bizarre fucking habit we,</v>

1978
01:28:53.750 --> 01:28:56.240
<v Speaker 4>we accept.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's so,</v>

1979
01:28:56.330 --> 01:28:58.940
<v Speaker 4>so common.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's one of the most common</v>

1980
01:28:59.270 --> 01:29:03.060
<v Speaker 1>bad health habits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a strange one,</v>

1981
01:29:03.061 --> 01:29:05.490
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so persistent that so many people</v>

1982
01:29:05.491 --> 01:29:10.230
<v Speaker 1>are willing to sell their health short</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the the the wide range of their</v>

1983
01:29:10.231 --> 01:29:11.064
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

1984
01:29:11.520 --> 01:29:13.700
<v Speaker 2>all the bad ears.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can just get him read and write out</v>

1985
01:29:13.710 --> 01:29:17.430
<v Speaker 2>them and enjoy your life is cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People say that's what they always say,</v>

1986
01:29:17.490 --> 01:29:18.780
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the excuse.</v>

1987
01:29:18.810 --> 01:29:22.140
<v Speaker 2>I mean I have a bit about it but there's</v>
<v Speaker 2>like some kind of science where they say</v>

1988
01:29:22.141 --> 01:29:25.080
<v Speaker 2>like every tie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every pack of cigarettes takes off like</v>

1989
01:29:25.081 --> 01:29:27.000
<v Speaker 2>30 minutes off of your life or something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>

1990
01:29:27.001 --> 01:29:31.830
<v Speaker 2>They figured out what the averages and</v>
<v Speaker 2>then so then if you figure out how many</v>

1991
01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:33.030
<v Speaker 2>years you smoke,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then you were like,</v>

1992
01:29:33.060 --> 01:29:35.670
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to live to be 100 so I'll</v>

1993
01:29:35.671 --> 01:29:37.940
<v Speaker 2>live to be 77 that's fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>

1994
01:29:38.110 --> 01:29:40.730
<v Speaker 2>There's a bunch of those bits out there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1995
01:29:41.010 --> 01:29:45.210
<v Speaker 2>That are exactly the same as that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But right now might be my bit was a,</v>

1996
01:29:45.660 --> 01:29:47.670
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes 30 minutes off your life.</v>

1997
01:29:47.671 --> 01:29:49.560
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll just wake up an hour early every</v>

1998
01:29:49.561 --> 01:29:51.000
<v Speaker 2>day and have two packs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1999
01:29:52.690 --> 01:29:54.810
<v Speaker 2>red band man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's funny.</v>

2000
01:29:55.400 --> 01:29:56.950
<v Speaker 1>But um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the um,</v>

2001
01:29:56.980 --> 01:29:58.150
<v Speaker 1>the other premise though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

2002
01:29:58.170 --> 01:30:00.620
<v Speaker 1>well that's a beat and premise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the premise of it,</v>

2003
01:30:00.700 --> 01:30:02.050
<v Speaker 1>but what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I going to miss?</v>

2004
01:30:02.051 --> 01:30:04.300
<v Speaker 1>Drooling and shitting myself and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>bummed.</v>

2005
01:30:05.140 --> 01:30:07.450
<v Speaker 1>That was one of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the last 20,</v>

2006
01:30:07.540 --> 01:30:09.100
<v Speaker 1>like there was a bunch of people that</v>
<v Speaker 1>did that.</v>

2007
01:30:09.210 --> 01:30:09.631
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a,</v>

2008
01:30:09.631 --> 01:30:13.800
<v Speaker 2>there's a few bits that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that I have retired and it's just</v>

2009
01:30:13.801 --> 01:30:15.360
<v Speaker 2>amazing how,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2010
01:30:15.361 --> 01:30:17.730
<v Speaker 2>with this all this amy Schumer stuff and</v>
<v Speaker 2>all that.</v>

2011
01:30:18.090 --> 01:30:21.000
<v Speaker 2>I saw a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I met a girl the other day,</v>

2012
01:30:21.001 --> 01:30:24.060
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even know she was a comic and</v>
<v Speaker 2>she told me her website.</v>

2013
01:30:24.061 --> 01:30:27.420
<v Speaker 2>And so later after I hung out with her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I went home,</v>

2014
01:30:27.570 --> 01:30:29.460
<v Speaker 2>went to our website and she's just a new</v>
<v Speaker 2>comic.</v>

2015
01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:33.630
<v Speaker 2>Opened up her front page on the front</v>
<v Speaker 2>page yet a video press play.</v>

2016
01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:36.510
<v Speaker 2>It was almost word for word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of my bits.</v>

2017
01:30:36.690 --> 01:30:37.710
<v Speaker 2>And I was just like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

2018
01:30:37.711 --> 01:30:40.590
<v Speaker 2>that's how easy it is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She's never seen me.</v>

2019
01:30:40.591 --> 01:30:42.150
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen her,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2020
01:30:42.180 --> 01:30:45.660
<v Speaker 2>we've never met,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've only done that bit a few times.</v>

2021
01:30:45.661 --> 01:30:49.350
<v Speaker 2>But how she said it was almost exactly</v>
<v Speaker 2>how I wrote it.</v>

2022
01:30:49.770 --> 01:30:53.950
<v Speaker 1>There's definitely going to be cases</v>
<v Speaker 1>that there's no way around it and it's</v>

2023
01:30:53.951 --> 01:30:55.180
<v Speaker 1>totally normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2024
01:30:55.181 --> 01:30:58.330
<v Speaker 1>Kurt Metzger had a real good point about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it and he's one of the guys who's</v>

2025
01:30:58.331 --> 01:31:02.050
<v Speaker 1>involved in this whole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the head writer of amy show and he</v>

2026
01:31:02.051 --> 01:31:05.430
<v Speaker 1>said that there's oftentimes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

2027
01:31:05.550 --> 01:31:09.940
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a fact that people write the exact</v>

2028
01:31:09.941 --> 01:31:13.690
<v Speaker 1>same premise and they have no idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They write a completely independently.</v>

2029
01:31:13.691 --> 01:31:16.000
<v Speaker 1>They know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wrote it independently and then</v>

2030
01:31:16.001 --> 01:31:18.370
<v Speaker 1>they'll see it on something and it'd</v>
<v Speaker 1>already been done.</v>

2031
01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:21.700
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Happens all the time.</v>

2032
01:31:21.730 --> 01:31:24.820
<v Speaker 1>Because if you can see funny in</v>
<v Speaker 1>something other people could see funny</v>

2033
01:31:24.821 --> 01:31:25.540
<v Speaker 1>or something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

2034
01:31:25.540 --> 01:31:28.180
<v Speaker 1>we're not talking about some insane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bizarre,</v>

2035
01:31:28.181 --> 01:31:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Esoteric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2036
01:31:29.890 --> 01:31:33.560
<v Speaker 1>Mr show with bob and Dave sketch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like they had some really busy,</v>

2037
01:31:33.730 --> 01:31:36.280
<v Speaker 1>if you stole one of those sketches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like dude,</v>

2038
01:31:36.460 --> 01:31:40.660
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty obvious that this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had like really bizarre original</v>

2039
01:31:40.661 --> 01:31:41.170
<v Speaker 1>subjects.</v>

2040
01:31:41.170 --> 01:31:43.720
<v Speaker 1>It's very strange show and the way it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>seamless,</v>

2041
01:31:43.721 --> 01:31:48.490
<v Speaker 1>it goes from one scene to the next and</v>
<v Speaker 1>one each show is like an entire piece.</v>

2042
01:31:48.491 --> 01:31:49.900
<v Speaker 1>It's all connected.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2043
01:31:49.901 --> 01:31:52.180
<v Speaker 1>if you're seeing the new show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Netflix one,</v>

2044
01:31:52.210 --> 01:31:53.200
<v Speaker 1>it's amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great,</v>

2045
01:31:53.230 --> 01:31:54.400
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really good.</v>

2046
01:31:54.820 --> 01:31:58.570
<v Speaker 1>But if you're just dealing with like</v>
<v Speaker 1>standard subjects like sex and,</v>

2047
01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:04.440
<v Speaker 1>and marriage and diseases and work and</v>
<v Speaker 1>drinking and you know,</v>

2048
01:32:04.661 --> 01:32:07.150
<v Speaker 1>whatever the fuck his sketches on just</v>
<v Speaker 1>normal stuff,</v>

2049
01:32:07.151 --> 01:32:10.870
<v Speaker 1>normal life stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you other people talk about that too.</v>

2050
01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:14.950
<v Speaker 1>And especially with sketches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have any fucking sketches had</v>

2051
01:32:14.951 --> 01:32:16.240
<v Speaker 1>been put out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

2052
01:32:16.241 --> 01:32:17.950
<v Speaker 1>we were thinking about this because of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this whole thing.</v>

2053
01:32:18.220 --> 01:32:20.530
<v Speaker 1>Think about all the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as of Saturday night live,</v>

2054
01:32:20.770 --> 01:32:22.660
<v Speaker 1>Saturday night live has been on for how</v>
<v Speaker 1>many years?</v>

2055
01:32:22.690 --> 01:32:23.970
<v Speaker 1>What is it like 30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>

2056
01:32:23.980 --> 01:32:25.180
<v Speaker 1>30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

2057
01:32:25.420 --> 01:32:28.150
<v Speaker 1>so 30 years of 52 weeks a year.</v>

2058
01:32:28.150 --> 01:32:30.700
<v Speaker 1>How many weeks are they up though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were up every week.</v>

2059
01:32:30.870 --> 01:32:33.690
<v Speaker 1>Now they do seasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just seasons.</v>

2060
01:32:33.910 --> 01:32:35.120
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2061
01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:38.680
<v Speaker 1>so just whatever the number is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>33 or something like that and probably</v>

2062
01:32:38.681 --> 01:32:41.110
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably more to think of all those</v>

2063
01:32:41.111 --> 01:32:43.590
<v Speaker 1>years of sketches in each one of them is</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

2064
01:32:43.630 --> 01:32:46.090
<v Speaker 1>How long has it an hour and a half so I</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't live as long.</v>

2065
01:32:46.091 --> 01:32:47.890
<v Speaker 1>Right Aaron?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Half hour and a half.</v>

2066
01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:51.070
<v Speaker 1>How many fucking sketches is that over</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those years?</v>

2067
01:32:51.071 --> 01:32:55.750
<v Speaker 1>It's hundreds and hundreds of premises</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you have mad tv which went on</v>

2068
01:32:55.751 --> 01:32:59.080
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People Forgot Mad TV went on forever and</v>

2069
01:32:59.081 --> 01:33:01.930
<v Speaker 1>they had some great fucking premises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about how many premises they</v>

2070
01:33:01.931 --> 01:33:04.040
<v Speaker 1>burned or used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2071
01:33:04.260 --> 01:33:07.270
<v Speaker 1>you know they burned off meaning you</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't use them anymore because the</v>

2072
01:33:07.271 --> 01:33:10.600
<v Speaker 1>sketch has already been done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's so many of them and you can</v>

2073
01:33:10.601 --> 01:33:15.601
<v Speaker 1>come up with the same ideas completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>independently and you think that you're,</v>

2074
01:33:15.780 --> 01:33:17.170
<v Speaker 1>you're a fucking trailblazer.</v>

2075
01:33:17.200 --> 01:33:18.160
<v Speaker 1>You're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh man,</v>

2076
01:33:18.310 --> 01:33:20.650
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that's the case of Amy</v>
<v Speaker 1>Schumer's stuff though.</v>

2077
01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:23.860
<v Speaker 1>You don't know because there were</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiple sketches from the same sketch.</v>

2078
01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:26.320
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's like the slap thing.</v>

2079
01:33:26.321 --> 01:33:30.550
<v Speaker 1>The other thing that what I think should</v>
<v Speaker 1>should find out if Kurtz headed</v>

2080
01:33:30.551 --> 01:33:32.620
<v Speaker 1>brighter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he said she find out who's the one that</v>

2081
01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:35.350
<v Speaker 1>took that are wrote that sketch and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what I mean?</v>

2082
01:33:35.351 --> 01:33:39.310
<v Speaker 1>And maybe hold that person responsible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

2083
01:33:39.311 --> 01:33:44.311
<v Speaker 1>And it is entirely possible that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>could come up with either one of those</v>

2084
01:33:47.051 --> 01:33:49.190
<v Speaker 1>things independently and it's entirely</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

2085
01:33:49.191 --> 01:33:51.280
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where it gets weird is that they're both</v>

2086
01:33:51.281 --> 01:33:54.520
<v Speaker 1>back to back in the exact same order and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's where it gets weird.</v>

2087
01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:57.460
<v Speaker 1>So is it possible for that to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2088
01:33:57.461 --> 01:33:59.050
<v Speaker 1>it's totally possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all,</v>

2089
01:34:00.010 --> 01:34:04.930
<v Speaker 1>I think he put it best when he was</v>
<v Speaker 1>criticizing his own show.</v>

2090
01:34:04.930 --> 01:34:06.880
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we're guilty of anything,</v>

2091
01:34:06.881 --> 01:34:09.340
<v Speaker 1>we're guilty of being hacky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

2092
01:34:09.400 --> 01:34:11.230
<v Speaker 1>it's Kinda a lot of the stuff's kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>hacky.</v>

2093
01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:14.190
<v Speaker 1>It's true though that some of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>sketches,</v>

2094
01:34:14.270 --> 01:34:15.190
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2095
01:34:15.191 --> 01:34:16.001
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hacking bag.</v>

2096
01:34:16.001 --> 01:34:18.940
<v Speaker 1>That's not true of what happened in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>case because these are multiple</v>

2097
01:34:18.941 --> 01:34:21.760
<v Speaker 1>incidences of this same like as an</v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

2098
01:34:21.770 --> 01:34:25.310
<v Speaker 1>the slap shep and the shake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think that's too right?</v>

2099
01:34:25.630 --> 01:34:27.730
<v Speaker 1>That's not the thing is that they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to back.</v>

2100
01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:30.970
<v Speaker 1>They're back to makes it weird because</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've seen the flintstones thing,</v>

2101
01:34:30.971 --> 01:34:31.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2102
01:34:31.710 --> 01:34:34.090
<v Speaker 1>So the slap chef,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2103
01:34:34.450 --> 01:34:35.051
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2104
01:34:35.051 --> 01:34:37.790
<v Speaker 1>the Kathleen Madigan joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although I know Kathleen,</v>

2105
01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:40.090
<v Speaker 1>she's hilarious and I'm sure she came up</v>
<v Speaker 1>with it on her own.</v>

2106
01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:45.520
<v Speaker 1>She probably didn't know that that had</v>
<v Speaker 1>been a part of the flintstones probably</v>

2107
01:34:45.521 --> 01:34:48.940
<v Speaker 1>forgot it or never saw it or who knows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That magician thing almost copied</v>

2108
01:34:48.941 --> 01:34:49.420
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>

2109
01:34:49.420 --> 01:34:53.710
<v Speaker 1>Almost exactly the same order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The black girl in or that black person</v>

2110
01:34:53.770 --> 01:34:56.170
<v Speaker 1>at the retail store where the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2111
01:34:56.171 --> 01:34:59.090
<v Speaker 1>that Keenan Peele or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't look good.</v>

2112
01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:00.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2113
01:35:00.580 --> 01:35:02.340
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't a key and Peele,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was her,</v>

2114
01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:04.160
<v Speaker 1>they were on mad tv actually at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

2115
01:35:04.220 --> 01:35:05.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2116
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:05.840
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't look good.</v>

2117
01:35:05.910 --> 01:35:07.190
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it doesn't look good,</v>

2118
01:35:07.191 --> 01:35:09.230
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what I think I,</v>

2119
01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:10.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's,</v>

2120
01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:12.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't think she's guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think she did.</v>

2121
01:35:12.050 --> 01:35:15.350
<v Speaker 1>It was writers and I think she needs to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2122
01:35:15.530 --> 01:35:16.760
<v Speaker 1>kind of stand up and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2123
01:35:16.761 --> 01:35:21.730
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't me and this guy stole two bits</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this guy stole two bits and we're,</v>

2124
01:35:21.740 --> 01:35:26.340
<v Speaker 1>we're assuming it did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But allegedly the problem is like,</v>

2125
01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:29.780
<v Speaker 1>first of all for her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she's in the worst position,</v>

2126
01:35:29.900 --> 01:35:31.040
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because,</v>

2127
01:35:31.041 --> 01:35:32.630
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's her show,</v>

2128
01:35:32.660 --> 01:35:34.850
<v Speaker 1>she's got her name on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if I was this,</v>

2129
01:35:34.910 --> 01:35:36.650
<v Speaker 1>I've looked at this like completely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>honestly,</v>

2130
01:35:36.651 --> 01:35:37.311
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's little,</v>

2131
01:35:37.311 --> 01:35:41.030
<v Speaker 1>as I watched sketch comedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that any of those bits had</v>

2132
01:35:41.031 --> 01:35:41.864
<v Speaker 1>been done before.</v>

2133
01:35:42.170 --> 01:35:43.790
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know that the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2134
01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:45.890
<v Speaker 1>all of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so pretty much all of them I didn't</v>

2135
01:35:45.891 --> 01:35:49.460
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if somebody has tried to sell those</v>

2136
01:35:49.461 --> 01:35:50.720
<v Speaker 1>to me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be like,</v>

2137
01:35:50.750 --> 01:35:51.620
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a good sketch.</v>

2138
01:35:51.621 --> 01:35:54.560
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I guess every time a sketch comes up,</v>

2139
01:35:54.590 --> 01:35:57.080
<v Speaker 1>you got to enter that premise into</v>
<v Speaker 1>google.</v>

2140
01:35:57.081 --> 01:35:58.970
<v Speaker 1>A Jim Norton and I were just talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about this weekend.</v>

2141
01:35:58.971 --> 01:36:00.710
<v Speaker 1>Like how do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like if you,</v>

2142
01:36:00.711 --> 01:36:03.170
<v Speaker 1>if you're writing like hundreds and</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of sketches,</v>

2143
01:36:03.770 --> 01:36:04.491
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>

2144
01:36:04.491 --> 01:36:06.260
<v Speaker 1>if you're doing like a siren lime or</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like that,</v>

2145
01:36:06.261 --> 01:36:08.870
<v Speaker 1>how do you find out whether or not this</v>
<v Speaker 1>premise has been done before?</v>

2146
01:36:08.950 --> 01:36:10.870
<v Speaker 1>It's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to worry about it.</v>

2147
01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:13.700
<v Speaker 1>What you have to do is do your own</v>
<v Speaker 1>version of that premise.</v>

2148
01:36:13.730 --> 01:36:17.630
<v Speaker 1>But like in this case if you'd like the</v>
<v Speaker 1>magician was exact rim off.</v>

2149
01:36:17.690 --> 01:36:20.510
<v Speaker 1>It was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was like buying a fake iphone from</v>

2150
01:36:20.511 --> 01:36:21.590
<v Speaker 1>Korea or China.</v>

2151
01:36:21.640 --> 01:36:26.640
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't a premise that they both</v>
<v Speaker 1>played around and it was an exact rip</v>

2152
01:36:26.781 --> 01:36:27.650
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2153
01:36:27.651 --> 01:36:29.630
<v Speaker 1>it was almost filmed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

2154
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:33.770
<v Speaker 1>Let's say it was the exact same sketch</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the exact same order,</v>

2155
01:36:33.771 --> 01:36:38.771
<v Speaker 1>whether it was a rip off those,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to say whether someone,</v>

2156
01:36:41.030 --> 01:36:42.350
<v Speaker 1>unless they come out and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

2157
01:36:42.351 --> 01:36:44.840
<v Speaker 1>I saw that guy do it and that's where I</v>
<v Speaker 1>came up with a bed.</v>

2158
01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:46.670
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I tried to pretend that I wrote it</v>

2159
01:36:46.671 --> 01:36:48.890
<v Speaker 1>myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unless they come out and say that it's</v>

2160
01:36:48.891 --> 01:36:53.270
<v Speaker 1>so hard to figure out what's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just being completely fair.</v>

2161
01:36:53.420 --> 01:36:56.480
<v Speaker 1>It's always hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is is there's multiple</v>

2162
01:36:56.481 --> 01:36:58.880
<v Speaker 1>instances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>

2163
01:36:59.570 --> 01:37:00.770
<v Speaker 1>I get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>

2164
01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:03.220
<v Speaker 1>Those premises though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

2165
01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:07.670
<v Speaker 1>There's a few of them that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that are pretty original.</v>

2166
01:37:07.730 --> 01:37:10.760
<v Speaker 1>I thought the counter guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll like her not being able to talk</v>

2167
01:37:10.761 --> 01:37:13.160
<v Speaker 1>to the black guy was pretty original</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

2168
01:37:13.550 --> 01:37:16.490
<v Speaker 1>but</v>
<v Speaker 1>who the fuck knows?</v>

2169
01:37:16.490 --> 01:37:17.990
<v Speaker 1>Man?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who knows?</v>

2170
01:37:19.010 --> 01:37:21.320
<v Speaker 1>It just sits possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If one person came up with that,</v>

2171
01:37:21.321 --> 01:37:23.300
<v Speaker 1>another person could come up with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same thing,</v>

2172
01:37:23.560 --> 01:37:25.110
<v Speaker 1>just you don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the,</v>

2173
01:37:25.190 --> 01:37:30.190
<v Speaker 1>the real problem lies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when people lie and steal and then</v>

2174
01:37:30.261 --> 01:37:32.900
<v Speaker 1>pretend they didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if someone is,</v>

2175
01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:34.281
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

2176
01:37:34.281 --> 01:37:36.110
<v Speaker 1>you have bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a killer bit.</v>

2177
01:37:36.290 --> 01:37:38.270
<v Speaker 1>And this guy just swipes it and starts</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing it.</v>

2178
01:37:38.271 --> 01:37:38.691
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

2179
01:37:38.691 --> 01:37:40.580
<v Speaker 1>I came up with the exact same bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so sorry.</v>

2180
01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:43.130
<v Speaker 1>And then starts doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then you've got an ethical problem,</v>

2181
01:37:43.160 --> 01:37:46.100
<v Speaker 1>then you've got a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you both come up with the same</v>

2182
01:37:46.101 --> 01:37:49.550
<v Speaker 1>bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a tell is probably the best at it.</v>

2183
01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:51.980
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the things to Norton and I were</v>

2184
01:37:51.981 --> 01:37:56.010
<v Speaker 1>talking about like a tail will go up to</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody when he has a a new bit.</v>

2185
01:37:56.011 --> 01:37:59.310
<v Speaker 1>If it seems like it came too easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he's like,</v>

2186
01:37:59.311 --> 01:38:00.390
<v Speaker 1>where'd that come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that,</v>

2187
01:38:00.391 --> 01:38:01.470
<v Speaker 1>if I heard this before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'll like,</v>

2188
01:38:01.500 --> 01:38:02.470
<v Speaker 1>he'll text you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey man,</v>

2189
01:38:02.471 --> 01:38:04.880
<v Speaker 1>have you heard this before?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He'll call you like,</v>

2190
01:38:04.890 --> 01:38:07.920
<v Speaker 1>he's real diligent about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if somebody else already has one,</v>

2191
01:38:08.460 --> 01:38:11.400
<v Speaker 1>just chucks it aside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I think,</v>

2192
01:38:11.401 --> 01:38:14.400
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the probably the best way to be.</v>

2193
01:38:14.670 --> 01:38:19.650
<v Speaker 1>Just do what you think is original and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2194
01:38:19.710 --> 01:38:23.400
<v Speaker 1>try to find out if anybody's already</v>
<v Speaker 1>done,</v>

2195
01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:25.290
<v Speaker 1>I guess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But how the fuck do you do that?</v>

2196
01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:27.780
<v Speaker 2>See what I do is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or what I try to do,</v>

2197
01:38:27.781 --> 01:38:29.430
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've always tried to do this,</v>

2198
01:38:29.431 --> 01:38:31.740
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except for you or,</v>

2199
01:38:31.770 --> 01:38:35.430
<v Speaker 2>or gone barris or brody Stevens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>theirs.</v>

2200
01:38:35.450 --> 01:38:38.700
<v Speaker 2>I don't watch comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like watching other comics.</v>

2201
01:38:38.701 --> 01:38:43.110
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to be influenced by it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I think if you has a comic,</v>

2202
01:38:43.140 --> 01:38:46.290
<v Speaker 2>if you follow that kind of rural where</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not really watching comedy,</v>

2203
01:38:46.590 --> 01:38:48.180
<v Speaker 2>even if he did come up at the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>presence,</v>

2204
01:38:48.210 --> 01:38:50.280
<v Speaker 2>you could,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could say with a straight face,</v>

2205
01:38:50.281 --> 01:38:51.780
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've never seen you.</v>

2206
01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:53.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't watch comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2207
01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:54.960
<v Speaker 2>that's what I thought of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2208
01:38:54.990 --> 01:38:57.480
<v Speaker 2>that's true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But you definitely look at it that way.</v>

2209
01:38:57.540 --> 01:38:59.790
<v Speaker 2>And there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's other comics that you always</v>

2210
01:38:59.791 --> 01:39:01.380
<v Speaker 2>see in the back of the room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They love comedy,</v>

2211
01:39:01.381 --> 01:39:02.660
<v Speaker 2>like watching comedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2212
01:39:02.680 --> 01:39:04.530
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so if that happened to somebody like</v>

2213
01:39:04.531 --> 01:39:05.011
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd be like,</v>

2214
01:39:05.011 --> 01:39:06.990
<v Speaker 2>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've watched me do that.</v>

2215
01:39:06.991 --> 01:39:08.700
<v Speaker 2>Joke 500 times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2216
01:39:09.010 --> 01:39:13.120
<v Speaker 1>But that's why I would have to tell you</v>
<v Speaker 1>like in certain circumstances like jokes</v>

2217
01:39:13.121 --> 01:39:15.790
<v Speaker 1>that are like really common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like um,</v>

2218
01:39:15.910 --> 01:39:18.490
<v Speaker 1>like the one that you did know that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>really common about,</v>

2219
01:39:18.491 --> 01:39:19.720
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2220
01:39:19.750 --> 01:39:21.820
<v Speaker 1>the last 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what do you like,</v>

2221
01:39:21.850 --> 01:39:25.030
<v Speaker 1>what years are you missing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what if you smoke cigarettes?</v>

2222
01:39:25.060 --> 01:39:27.020
<v Speaker 2>It 20 years off your life.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2223
01:39:27.100 --> 01:39:28.510
<v Speaker 2>I like your take on it though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're taking on,</v>

2224
01:39:28.511 --> 01:39:31.330
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty funny cause it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a ridiculous red band math</v>

2225
01:39:31.331 --> 01:39:33.640
<v Speaker 2>equation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like 30 minutes a day.</v>

2226
01:39:33.641 --> 01:39:34.940
<v Speaker 2>Just wake up an hour early,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2227
01:39:35.710 --> 01:39:38.050
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a ridiculous read bad math</v>

2228
01:39:38.051 --> 01:39:39.400
<v Speaker 2>equation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But um,</v>

2229
01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:42.910
<v Speaker 2>can you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>can you copy write jokes?</v>

2230
01:39:42.970 --> 01:39:45.010
<v Speaker 2>I mean I know you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at it right now.</v>

2231
01:39:45.011 --> 01:39:46.960
<v Speaker 2>You can.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But like what'd you have?</v>

2232
01:39:46.961 --> 01:39:48.690
<v Speaker 2>You are like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you heard of someone doing it?</v>

2233
01:39:49.130 --> 01:39:50.160
<v Speaker 1>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

2234
01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:51.890
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2235
01:39:51.980 --> 01:39:54.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you think about all the standup</v>

2236
01:39:54.681 --> 01:39:58.040
<v Speaker 1>comics in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's probably thousands of us,</v>

2237
01:39:58.041 --> 01:40:00.200
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for the most part there's very few</v>

2238
01:40:00.201 --> 01:40:02.240
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the reasons why there's very</v>

2239
01:40:02.241 --> 01:40:07.241
<v Speaker 1>few problems is cause we kind of police</v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves and we make it a big point</v>

2240
01:40:07.790 --> 01:40:10.850
<v Speaker 1>about being fair and about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2241
01:40:10.851 --> 01:40:14.270
<v Speaker 1>supporting artists that don't do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

2242
01:40:14.271 --> 01:40:16.370
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not supporting artists who do do it.</v>

2243
01:40:16.400 --> 01:40:19.840
<v Speaker 1>And it doesn't mean just because someone</v>
<v Speaker 1>has done it in the past too,</v>

2244
01:40:20.330 --> 01:40:24.350
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean that they're a terrible</v>
<v Speaker 1>person that can never redeem themselves.</v>

2245
01:40:24.351 --> 01:40:26.420
<v Speaker 1>They can never know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't mean that at all.</v>

2246
01:40:26.421 --> 01:40:28.520
<v Speaker 1>It means they fucked up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People fuck up.</v>

2247
01:40:28.521 --> 01:40:29.700
<v Speaker 1>People make mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't it,</v>

2248
01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:32.830
<v Speaker 2>there were police itself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of like the comedians that'll take</v>

2249
01:40:32.831 --> 01:40:33.664
<v Speaker 2>care of itself.</v>

2250
01:40:34.320 --> 01:40:36.330
<v Speaker 1>I think more than anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2251
01:40:36.331 --> 01:40:38.640
<v Speaker 1>It's comedy fans that are policing it</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

2252
01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:40.760
<v Speaker 1>It's a really interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and,</v>

2253
01:40:40.761 --> 01:40:45.720
<v Speaker 1>and I say fans and I use it in a loose</v>
<v Speaker 1>term possible cause some of them are</v>

2254
01:40:45.721 --> 01:40:48.420
<v Speaker 1>actual fans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The person they're going after and some</v>

2255
01:40:48.421 --> 01:40:50.190
<v Speaker 1>of them are just not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2256
01:40:50.191 --> 01:40:51.570
<v Speaker 1>some of 'em,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2257
01:40:51.750 --> 01:40:56.400
<v Speaker 1>they've been looking some reason why</v>
<v Speaker 1>this person is no good for awhile.</v>

2258
01:40:56.530 --> 01:40:59.020
<v Speaker 1>And then when they find this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just go wild with it and they love</v>

2259
01:40:59.021 --> 01:41:00.280
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

2260
01:41:00.490 --> 01:41:02.770
<v Speaker 1>so they're not necessarily fans of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>person.</v>

2261
01:41:03.250 --> 01:41:07.240
<v Speaker 1>So if they're making a video about her,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not necessarily fans of her,</v>

2262
01:41:07.241 --> 01:41:09.700
<v Speaker 1>but they might call themselves comedy</v>
<v Speaker 1>fans,</v>

2263
01:41:10.090 --> 01:41:11.740
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so they see something like this</v>

2264
01:41:11.741 --> 01:41:16.210
<v Speaker 1>happen and they get furious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just have to be real careful because</v>

2265
01:41:16.211 --> 01:41:18.330
<v Speaker 1>it's theirs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

2266
01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:20.860
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a giant issue with it being a</v>

2267
01:41:20.861 --> 01:41:23.710
<v Speaker 1>bunch of people writing on a show and</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing sketches,</v>

2268
01:41:23.711 --> 01:41:26.590
<v Speaker 1>it's so fucking hard to know where those</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are coming from.</v>

2269
01:41:27.550 --> 01:41:28.870
<v Speaker 1>It's just real hard to know.</v>

2270
01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:31.960
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting though that it always</v>
<v Speaker 2>seems to happen,</v>

2271
01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:33.200
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

2272
01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:34.570
<v Speaker 2>like yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the mind Admin,</v>

2273
01:41:34.680 --> 01:41:37.950
<v Speaker 2>Sia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got amy Schumer's show you,</v>

2274
01:41:38.740 --> 01:41:43.510
<v Speaker 2>I saw the other day at John Heffron bit</v>
<v Speaker 2>that made it up in keene peel.</v>

2275
01:41:43.570 --> 01:41:44.860
<v Speaker 2>Like it was almost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2276
01:41:45.130 --> 01:41:50.130
<v Speaker 2>And</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like that maybe that the people</v>

2277
01:41:51.221 --> 01:41:55.120
<v Speaker 2>that write for these kinds of shows</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't think it's that bad,</v>

2278
01:41:55.300 --> 01:41:57.550
<v Speaker 2>especially since it's all the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>network.</v>

2279
01:41:57.670 --> 01:41:58.830
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think first of all,</v>

2280
01:41:58.980 --> 01:42:00.360
<v Speaker 1>there's some people that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2281
01:42:00.420 --> 01:42:05.400
<v Speaker 1>And this isn't meant to hold standup</v>
<v Speaker 1>comics and some crazy high form of</v>

2282
01:42:05.610 --> 01:42:08.880
<v Speaker 1>ethics and morality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's some people that write on</v>

2283
01:42:08.881 --> 01:42:13.881
<v Speaker 1>shows that are not standup comedians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And their ideas about ideas are</v>

2284
01:42:14.071 --> 01:42:17.370
<v Speaker 1>different than our ideas about our ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>without,</v>

2285
01:42:17.371 --> 01:42:20.700
<v Speaker 1>what I mean by that is if they can get</v>
<v Speaker 1>away with it,</v>

2286
01:42:20.730 --> 01:42:24.960
<v Speaker 1>some of them will pill for an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's take it from a book and</v>

2287
01:42:24.961 --> 01:42:26.580
<v Speaker 1>rearrange it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2288
01:42:26.610 --> 01:42:31.050
<v Speaker 1>take it from a video and transcribe it</v>
<v Speaker 1>and don't give the person credit who</v>

2289
01:42:31.051 --> 01:42:35.970
<v Speaker 1>said it the first time when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when people are taking jokes from</v>

2290
01:42:35.971 --> 01:42:39.240
<v Speaker 1>comedians and using them to create</v>
<v Speaker 1>sketches with them and pretending that</v>

2291
01:42:39.241 --> 01:42:41.550
<v Speaker 1>they came up with them on their own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2292
01:42:41.551 --> 01:42:42.570
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2293
01:42:42.630 --> 01:42:44.280
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not cool.</v>

2294
01:42:45.030 --> 01:42:46.470
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's fucking gross.</v>

2295
01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:49.650
<v Speaker 1>But they're not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they probably aren't comedians.</v>

2296
01:42:49.770 --> 01:42:54.770
<v Speaker 1>So it's like if you had like a really</v>
<v Speaker 1>funny line for a joke that was a lyric</v>

2297
01:42:56.160 --> 01:42:57.780
<v Speaker 1>of a song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2298
01:42:57.781 --> 01:42:59.490
<v Speaker 1>and you heard a song and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

2299
01:42:59.491 --> 01:43:00.930
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to put this in my act that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to,</v>

2300
01:43:01.260 --> 01:43:06.260
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to have this amazing punchline</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my act that is from this song.</v>

2301
01:43:08.100 --> 01:43:10.830
<v Speaker 1>So like the joke in the song,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now I'm going to pretend I came up with</v>

2302
01:43:10.831 --> 01:43:12.150
<v Speaker 1>it on my own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting my act.</v>

2303
01:43:12.420 --> 01:43:14.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like similar in that kind of a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what I'm saying?</v>

2304
01:43:14.610 --> 01:43:17.220
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like someone who's not a comic,</v>

2305
01:43:17.510 --> 01:43:18.450
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to think,</v>

2306
01:43:18.570 --> 01:43:21.150
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if they would then not even a</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the comedy community,</v>

2307
01:43:21.151 --> 01:43:24.960
<v Speaker 1>they were a writer like fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this dude is going to gang get shit.</v>

2308
01:43:25.130 --> 01:43:26.760
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just going to fill it.</v>

2309
01:43:26.761 --> 01:43:29.730
<v Speaker 1>Just going to become productive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the odds these people going to</v>

2310
01:43:29.731 --> 01:43:34.140
<v Speaker 1>watch an old 20 years episode of what's</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening?</v>

2311
01:43:34.440 --> 01:43:35.760
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our 40 years,</v>

2312
01:43:35.761 --> 01:43:37.920
<v Speaker 1>how long ago was that on a long time</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

2313
01:43:37.921 --> 01:43:39.360
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who the fuck's gonna Watch what's</v>

2314
01:43:39.361 --> 01:43:41.100
<v Speaker 1>happening and to go over all those</v>
<v Speaker 1>premises?</v>

2315
01:43:41.430 --> 01:43:43.680
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there might be a hilarious premise that</v>

2316
01:43:43.700 --> 01:43:46.770
<v Speaker 1>they could pull out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did I say what's happening?</v>

2317
01:43:46.980 --> 01:43:49.020
<v Speaker 1>What's happening with that terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your sketches.</v>

2318
01:43:49.800 --> 01:43:53.500
<v Speaker 1>I was trying to think of something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a old Sitcom,</v>

2319
01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:53.610
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

2320
01:43:53.610 --> 01:43:54.443
<v Speaker 3>True.</v>

2321
01:43:56.130 --> 01:43:59.250
<v Speaker 2>One thing I always thought was</v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting is because it just from</v>

2322
01:43:59.251 --> 01:44:04.251
<v Speaker 2>watching so many roast battles and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 2>like that is how roast jokes are like</v>

2323
01:44:05.071 --> 01:44:10.071
<v Speaker 2>the same jokes that they've used for</v>
<v Speaker 2>years and years and years and years just</v>

2324
01:44:10.591 --> 01:44:14.310
<v Speaker 2>kind of rebranded and like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it used to be totally acceptable.</v>

2325
01:44:14.311 --> 01:44:17.340
<v Speaker 2>Before there was internet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before there was TV shows,</v>

2326
01:44:17.341 --> 01:44:19.560
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like the friars club and all that stuff</v>

2327
01:44:19.561 --> 01:44:22.470
<v Speaker 2>like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're all kind of like taken from each</v>

2328
01:44:22.471 --> 01:44:26.400
<v Speaker 2>other and reusing shit that Charlie</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chaplin may have said.</v>

2329
01:44:26.401 --> 01:44:30.990
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's just interesting that that's</v>

2330
01:44:30.991 --> 01:44:35.670
<v Speaker 2>like one of the few things in comedy</v>
<v Speaker 2>that it's kind of like an unspoken</v>

2331
01:44:35.671 --> 01:44:36.630
<v Speaker 2>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but who cares?</v>

2332
01:44:36.660 --> 01:44:37.360
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like it's,</v>

2333
01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:40.770
<v Speaker 2>it's no one's getting mad if you reuse a</v>
<v Speaker 2>roast joke that,</v>

2334
01:44:40.830 --> 01:44:43.750
<v Speaker 2>that Milton Berle mom made,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2335
01:44:43.940 --> 01:44:46.370
<v Speaker 2>like around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But they probably would if there were</v>

2336
01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:48.720
<v Speaker 2>roast fans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Hinchcliffe would probably be mad</v>

2337
01:44:48.730 --> 01:44:50.910
<v Speaker 2>because he's a roast fan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2338
01:44:50.911 --> 01:44:54.600
<v Speaker 2>When now with TV and stuff like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's interesting because like if they</v>

2339
01:44:54.601 --> 01:44:57.990
<v Speaker 2>have like a roast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like show on comedy central,</v>

2340
01:44:57.991 --> 01:45:00.210
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so like amy or somebody does a joke on</v>

2341
01:45:00.211 --> 01:45:05.211
<v Speaker 2>that and they reuse it and that roast</v>
<v Speaker 2>few years later that now it's like,</v>

2342
01:45:05.401 --> 01:45:06.480
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can't do that anymore.</v>

2343
01:45:06.510 --> 01:45:08.790
<v Speaker 2>Even though he used to be able to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that was the whole thing,</v>

2344
01:45:08.791 --> 01:45:09.370
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2345
01:45:09.370 --> 01:45:11.650
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if that's what the whole thing</v>
<v Speaker 3>was.</v>

2346
01:45:11.950 --> 01:45:13.690
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what it was in the</v>

2347
01:45:14.170 --> 01:45:15.400
<v Speaker 3>catskills days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2348
01:45:15.940 --> 01:45:18.190
<v Speaker 3>And the um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the old days,</v>

2349
01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:19.233
<v Speaker 3>they would,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2350
01:45:19.450 --> 01:45:21.910
<v Speaker 3>have these resorts like from dirty</v>
<v Speaker 3>dancing.</v>

2351
01:45:22.180 --> 01:45:23.260
<v Speaker 3>That was the catskills.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

2352
01:45:23.700 --> 01:45:26.980
<v Speaker 3>Other than it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2353
01:45:28.030 --> 01:45:29.890
<v Speaker 3>that's how fucked up cigarettes are.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

2354
01:45:29.950 --> 01:45:32.920
<v Speaker 3>Cigarettes took Patrick swayze.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2355
01:45:32.980 --> 01:45:35.260
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we lost Patrick swayze to cigarettes.</v>

2356
01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:38.320
<v Speaker 3>We lost the dude from roadhouse with the</v>
<v Speaker 3>flowing locks.</v>

2357
01:45:39.070 --> 01:45:43.630
<v Speaker 3>You know how to invest just alone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fluxes in the mirror every day.</v>

2358
01:45:44.500 --> 01:45:45.870
<v Speaker 3>He's still alive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's like 70.</v>

2359
01:45:45.871 --> 01:45:47.190
<v Speaker 3>He looks great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2360
01:45:47.400 --> 01:45:51.270
<v Speaker 2>Popular dirty dancing was and how</v>
<v Speaker 2>popular that soundtrack was that they</v>

2361
01:45:51.271 --> 01:45:55.560
<v Speaker 2>released a soundtrack like two months</v>
<v Speaker 2>after that had none of the music from</v>

2362
01:45:55.561 --> 01:45:57.480
<v Speaker 2>the movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was just called like dirty</v>

2363
01:45:57.481 --> 01:46:01.040
<v Speaker 2>dancing soundtrack part too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was just a way to sell another.</v>

2364
01:46:01.210 --> 01:46:06.210
<v Speaker 3>But that is every girl's dream.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A beautiful man who can dance.</v>

2365
01:46:06.631 --> 01:46:10.290
<v Speaker 3>There's a really manly man who will</v>
<v Speaker 3>fight to defend his right to dance.</v>

2366
01:46:12.210 --> 01:46:14.310
<v Speaker 3>Is that correct?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Perfect cheekbones.</v>

2367
01:46:14.340 --> 01:46:17.010
<v Speaker 3>If I say that to any other girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>are you kidding me?</v>

2368
01:46:17.770 --> 01:46:19.200
<v Speaker 3>This guy got God.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Get out of here.</v>

2369
01:46:19.260 --> 01:46:22.260
<v Speaker 3>If I was a girl,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd have babies with that dude bodily.</v>

2370
01:46:22.530 --> 01:46:24.390
<v Speaker 3>That's your guy a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're on vacation.</v>

2371

<v Speaker 3>He's got perfect hair,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beautiful features.</v>

2373
01:46:29.700 --> 01:46:31.380
<v Speaker 3>He's supple.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knows how to move,</v>

2374
01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:33.000
<v Speaker 3>smoked cigarettes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He looks cool.</v>

2375
01:46:34.140 --> 01:46:35.940
<v Speaker 3>Cigarettes caught them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dude,</v>

2376
01:46:36.000 --> 01:46:37.950
<v Speaker 3>Patrick swayze,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not that old.</v>

2377
01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:42.450
<v Speaker 3>Do you understand like this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this fucking guy died from cigarettes</v>

2378
01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:46.830
<v Speaker 3>and he's not that old.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of people that are way</v>

2379
01:46:46.831 --> 01:46:51.831
<v Speaker 3>older than him that are doing great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's women that have been</v>

2380
01:46:51.961 --> 01:46:54.150
<v Speaker 3>smoking two packs of cigarettes every</v>
<v Speaker 3>day,</v>

2381
01:46:54.151 --> 01:46:55.660
<v Speaker 3>spent their whole life and her 102.</v>

2382
01:46:56.530 --> 01:46:58.800
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But they look like monsters.</v>

2383
01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:03.450
<v Speaker 3>It'll become monster.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I could just be come to their body</v>

2384
01:47:03.451 --> 01:47:06.300
<v Speaker 3>morphs and changes to accept the</v>
<v Speaker 3>cigarettes.</v>

2385
01:47:06.510 --> 01:47:08.580
<v Speaker 3>When you're like a hundred and you're</v>
<v Speaker 3>still small,</v>

2386
01:47:10.710 --> 01:47:14.280
<v Speaker 3>you're like some fucking cigarette</v>
<v Speaker 3>burning beast.</v>

2387
01:47:14.550 --> 01:47:18.510
<v Speaker 3>Some thing that's in inhaling these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this chemical that's a new part of your</v>

2388
01:47:18.511 --> 01:47:21.330
<v Speaker 3>system.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've been spoken for about 26 years and</v>

2389
01:47:21.331 --> 01:47:23.820
<v Speaker 3>I look at like a fresh little baby.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a part of the system.</v>

2390
01:47:24.690 --> 01:47:28.240
<v Speaker 3>You're in the matrix.</v>
<v Speaker 3>My by NBC.</v>

2391
01:47:28.330 --> 01:47:30.350
<v Speaker 3>By him.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How many do you,</v>

2392
01:47:30.420 --> 01:47:33.350
<v Speaker 3>how many do you do every day?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm like a pack.</v>

2393
01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:34.920
<v Speaker 3>A pack.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hold back a day.</v>

2394
01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:37.470
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

2395
01:47:37.650 --> 01:47:39.930
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it's more,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sometimes it's less.</v>

2396
01:47:40.020 --> 01:47:41.590
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that's another thing that made</v>

2397
01:47:41.610 --> 01:47:45.270
<v Speaker 3>you on my podcast.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's one of my neck that was him in the</v>

2398
01:47:45.271 --> 01:47:49.980
<v Speaker 3>bitter and he was still smoking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>His body was rotting away and he had a</v>

2399
01:47:49.981 --> 01:47:51.510
<v Speaker 3>cigarette hanging out of his mouth.</v>

2400
01:47:51.570 --> 01:47:54.310
<v Speaker 3>It doesn't seem like a good idea to</v>
<v Speaker 3>continue to smoke.</v>

2401
01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:58.050
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Look at him.</v>

2402
01:47:58.140 --> 01:48:00.540
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's craziness.</v>

2403
01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:03.030
<v Speaker 3>But it's weird because it was still</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting treatment.</v>

2404
01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:06.180
<v Speaker 3>It's weird man.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I wonder if like he laid off of it for a</v>

2405
01:48:06.181 --> 01:48:08.310
<v Speaker 3>while,</v>
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

2406
01:48:08.610 --> 01:48:12.090
<v Speaker 3>It's sad one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he did a television show because he</v>

2407
01:48:12.091 --> 01:48:13.260
<v Speaker 3>was hot.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was hot.</v>

2408
01:48:13.261 --> 01:48:16.260
<v Speaker 3>Wallace was all happening.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he did a TV show and I'm sure that</v>

2409
01:48:16.261 --> 01:48:20.010
<v Speaker 3>didn't help him at the long hours and</v>
<v Speaker 3>the stress of that TV show.</v>

2410
01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:22.890
<v Speaker 3>I forgot about that TV show.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well what I don't remember,</v>

2411
01:48:24.090 --> 01:48:26.520
<v Speaker 3>but um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he uh,</v>

2412
01:48:26.610 --> 01:48:30.000
<v Speaker 3>he went out the hard way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shit's real.</v>

2413
01:48:30.140 --> 01:48:32.340
<v Speaker 3>That's what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was called the beast.</v>

2414

<v Speaker 3>If you're flipping channels and</v>
<v Speaker 3>roadhouses on,</v>

<v Speaker 3>It's on.</v>

2423
01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:52.830
<v Speaker 3>It's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's a pretty classic movie.</v>

2424
01:48:53.010 --> 01:48:56.010
<v Speaker 3>It's a slice of Americana.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's like a piece of,</v>

2425
01:48:56.720 --> 01:49:01.720
<v Speaker 3>it's a piece of like civilization just</v>
<v Speaker 3>strapped into some cultural,</v>

2426
01:49:04.171 --> 01:49:05.750
<v Speaker 3>iconic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>ridiculous.</v>

2427
01:49:05.780 --> 01:49:08.880
<v Speaker 3>They just made another movie that was a</v>
<v Speaker 3>good one of his called point break,</v>

2428
01:49:08.881 --> 01:49:10.530
<v Speaker 3>which I heard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see it,</v>

2429
01:49:10.531 --> 01:49:13.530
<v Speaker 3>but I heard it wasn't like great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The premise wasn't even the same movie</v>

2430
01:49:13.531 --> 01:49:15.030
<v Speaker 3>though.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But are you worried about roadhouse</v>

2431
01:49:15.060 --> 01:49:17.050
<v Speaker 3>coming back out and being totally</v>
<v Speaker 3>different kinds of things,</v>

2432
01:49:17.051 --> 01:49:17.850
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rhonda?</v>

2433
01:49:17.850 --> 01:49:19.830
<v Speaker 3>Rhonda is going to do roadhouses it's</v>
<v Speaker 3>going to be different.</v>

2434
01:49:19.831 --> 01:49:21.870
<v Speaker 3>She has a vagina.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's totally different.</v>

2435
01:49:21.890 --> 01:49:23.250
<v Speaker 3>You see her on Saturday night live?</v>
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2436
01:49:23.251 --> 01:49:25.410
<v Speaker 3>I didn't see her.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was good though.</v>

2437
01:49:26.390 --> 01:49:27.840
<v Speaker 3>Did you hear it was good?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2438
01:49:27.841 --> 01:49:31.620
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>certain people really invest in,</v>

2439
01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:33.510
<v Speaker 3>in making it their own,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

2440
01:49:33.660 --> 01:49:36.270
<v Speaker 3>And then there's other people that kind</v>
<v Speaker 3>of just go through the motions.</v>

2441
01:49:36.690 --> 01:49:37.530
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>from what I saw,</v>

2442
01:49:37.531 --> 01:49:38.880
<v Speaker 3>it just seemed like the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the ladder.</v>

2443
01:49:38.960 --> 01:49:41.070
<v Speaker 3>Then it just seemed,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

2444
01:49:41.100 --> 01:49:43.410
<v Speaker 3>She seemed like she did great job,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but she didn't like,</v>

2445
01:49:43.470 --> 01:49:44.930
<v Speaker 3>she's not a public speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2446
01:49:45.180 --> 01:49:48.280
<v Speaker 3>Probably hard as fuck to do someone that</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't a public</v>

2447
01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:49.240
<v Speaker 1>speaker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine?</v>

2448
01:49:50.590 --> 01:49:51.730
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2449
01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:55.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I wonder definitely,</v>

2450
01:49:55.540 --> 01:49:57.190
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're not used to it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yeah,</v>

2451
01:49:57.191 --> 01:49:58.840
<v Speaker 1>it's an iconic thing to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2452
01:49:58.841 --> 01:50:02.020
<v Speaker 1>I'd be nervous as fuck all years I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>done stand up.</v>

2453
01:50:02.170 --> 01:50:04.120
<v Speaker 1>If I had a host site live,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd be nervous as far.</v>

2454
01:50:04.130 --> 01:50:04.650
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2455
01:50:04.650 --> 01:50:05.483
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you try?</v>

2456
01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:06.870
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every assay we wouldn't do it.</v>

2457
01:50:06.920 --> 01:50:09.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not interested in working at beach.</v>

2458
01:50:09.561 --> 01:50:11.070
<v Speaker 1>Just interesting though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've done,</v>

2459
01:50:11.310 --> 01:50:14.280
<v Speaker 1>I think I've done too much work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do.</v>

2460
01:50:14.430 --> 01:50:18.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm interested in enjoying myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think at this stage of my life,</v>

2461
01:50:18.750 --> 01:50:23.190
<v Speaker 1>like the one I'm becoming more and more</v>
<v Speaker 1>cognizant of as I get older is you can</v>

2462
01:50:23.191 --> 01:50:24.870
<v Speaker 1>work too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not good.</v>

2463
01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:28.530
<v Speaker 1>It's not good to work too much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like there's a good amount of work you</v>

2464
01:50:28.531 --> 01:50:30.200
<v Speaker 1>should do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's a lot of people that like</v>

2465
01:50:30.210 --> 01:50:32.250
<v Speaker 1>pride themselves and working too much</v>
<v Speaker 1>and working the,</v>

2466
01:50:32.251 --> 01:50:34.500
<v Speaker 1>wearing themselves out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like it's something they carry around</v>

2467
01:50:34.740 --> 01:50:36.690
<v Speaker 1>like a shield,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know that?</v>

2468
01:50:37.070 --> 01:50:38.130
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably not.</v>

2469
01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:40.680
<v Speaker 1>If you don't have to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I understand if you have to do it,</v>

2470
01:50:40.950 --> 01:50:43.590
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't have to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'd probably like have some fun.</v>

2471
01:50:43.830 --> 01:50:45.450
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like don't,</v>

2472
01:50:45.600 --> 01:50:50.600
<v Speaker 1>don't get overwhelmed with the desire to</v>
<v Speaker 1>succeed cause that your whole life could</v>

2473
01:50:51.271 --> 01:50:51.900
<v Speaker 1>pass you by.</v>

2474
01:50:51.900 --> 01:50:53.670
<v Speaker 1>If you're one of those Gordon Gekko</v>
<v Speaker 1>assholes,</v>

2475
01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:55.710
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your whole life can pass you by for some</v>

2476
01:50:55.711 --> 01:50:58.290
<v Speaker 1>crazy hedge funds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sociopath on the loose,</v>

<v Speaker 1>out of the matrix with his fucking</v>

<v Speaker 1>he's a part of it.</v>

2480
01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:09.330
<v Speaker 1>So He's successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But along the way,</v>

2481
01:51:09.331 --> 01:51:11.310
<v Speaker 1>he's not even having any fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that guy ain't happening.</v>

2485
01:51:28.500 --> 01:51:33.150
<v Speaker 1>It's um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so weird way to live life.</v>

2486
01:51:34.570 --> 01:51:38.580
<v Speaker 2>So funny that somebody asked me the</v>
<v Speaker 2>other day if I can find them at all and</v>

2487
01:51:38.600 --> 01:51:39.720
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2488
01:51:39.721 --> 01:51:41.370
<v Speaker 2>I don't know anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But if you need cocaine,</v>

2489
01:51:41.371 --> 01:51:43.730
<v Speaker 2>I can get that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2490
01:51:43.740 --> 01:51:47.700
<v Speaker 2>like how weird is it that it is weird</v>
<v Speaker 2>backwards you've ever been?</v>

2491

<v Speaker 2>Why Whitewater rafting?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2492
01:51:50.100 --> 01:51:52.860
<v Speaker 2>that's something that you should try</v>
<v Speaker 2>some type that's crazy.</v>

2493
01:51:53.070 --> 01:51:56.310
<v Speaker 1>Gone canoeing down the white waters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not White waters.</v>

2494
01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:58.050
<v Speaker 1>I shouldn't even say white waters down a</v>
<v Speaker 1>river.</v>

2495
01:51:58.590 --> 01:52:00.180
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were some tricky spots,</v>

2496
01:52:00.181 --> 01:52:01.920
<v Speaker 1>like some spots near rocks and stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>like that,</v>

2497
01:52:01.921 --> 01:52:05.550
<v Speaker 1>but nothing like real fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Whitewater stuff looks a phone.</v>

2498
01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:06.393
<v Speaker 1>A newsroom.</v>

2499
01:52:06.750 --> 01:52:07.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My,</v>

2500
01:52:07.440 --> 01:52:11.610
<v Speaker 2>my dad almost died doing it once because</v>
<v Speaker 2>he got caught underneath the raft and he</v>

2501
01:52:11.611 --> 01:52:13.710
<v Speaker 2>said he couldn't breathe and he just</v>
<v Speaker 2>gave up.</v>

2502
01:52:13.711 --> 01:52:15.630
<v Speaker 2>And then they're at the last second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just floating down.</v>

2503
01:52:15.631 --> 01:52:17.460
<v Speaker 2>Somebody just grabbed him out of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>water.</v>

2504
01:52:17.580 --> 01:52:19.670
<v Speaker 1>My Friend Remy Warren,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2505
01:52:19.710 --> 01:52:23.340
<v Speaker 1>who's done the podcast a few times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the last time that he was on,</v>

2506
01:52:23.341 --> 01:52:26.340
<v Speaker 1>but the time before that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the first time he was on,</v>

2507
01:52:26.910 --> 01:52:27.743
<v Speaker 1>he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

2508
01:52:27.960 --> 01:52:31.650
<v Speaker 1>told me a story about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was a,</v>

2509
01:52:31.750 --> 01:52:36.750
<v Speaker 1>in the woods and he saw a body come down</v>
<v Speaker 1>the river and the guy's face down in the</v>

2510
01:52:37.471 --> 01:52:40.290
<v Speaker 1>water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He saw some clothes and uh,</v>

2511
01:52:40.350 --> 01:52:41.570
<v Speaker 1>then he saw a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

2512
01:52:41.580 --> 01:52:42.660
<v Speaker 1>you saw some gear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2513
01:52:42.661 --> 01:52:45.920
<v Speaker 1>floating down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he saw a body and he realized,</v>

2514
01:52:45.950 --> 01:52:49.970
<v Speaker 1>Oh shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then he saw a woman and the woman</v>

2515
01:52:49.971 --> 01:52:54.110
<v Speaker 1>was bobbing her head up in the air and</v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to survive and getting caught up</v>

2516
01:52:54.111 --> 01:52:57.230
<v Speaker 1>in the current,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he ran into that fucking water</v>

2517
01:52:57.350 --> 01:53:00.230
<v Speaker 1>thinking that he was going to die</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking like this.</v>

2518
01:53:00.231 --> 01:53:02.690
<v Speaker 1>I just made the biggest mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try to help us,</v>

2519
01:53:02.691 --> 01:53:04.610
<v Speaker 1>lady,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to wind up dying like,</v>

2625
01:57:41.781 --> 01:57:43.220
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>It is probably going to be,</v>

2626
01:57:43.221 --> 01:57:48.200
<v Speaker 8>once they figured out teleporting,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you'd have to buy herself the first day</v>

<v Speaker 8>accidents every year.</v>
<v Speaker 8>If you just think about how many people</v>

2636
01:58:12.591 --> 01:58:17.591
<v Speaker 8>die if we were thinking like our real</v>
<v Speaker 8>enemy is the automobile.</v>

2637
01:58:17.660 --> 01:58:20.390
<v Speaker 8>Automobiles are killing people with know</v>
<v Speaker 8>people driving them,</v>

2638
01:58:20.391 --> 01:58:23.390
<v Speaker 8>but God won't be hitting into people,</v>
<v Speaker 8>people hitting things in their</v>

2639
01:58:23.391 --> 01:58:25.250
<v Speaker 8>automobiles.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's what's killing people.</v>

2640
01:58:25.400 --> 01:58:28.010
<v Speaker 8>If you really looked at it that way,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the numbers are pretty high.</v>

2641
01:58:28.190 --> 01:58:31.220
<v Speaker 8>I think it's like 30,000 people or</v>
<v Speaker 8>something crazy die in automobile</v>

2642
01:58:31.221 --> 01:58:32.900
<v Speaker 8>accidents every year.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

2643
01:58:32.950 --> 01:58:34.130
<v Speaker 8>Mean if that was a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

2644

<v Speaker 8>an enemy,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

2645
01:58:35.751 --> 01:58:38.150
<v Speaker 8>robot enemy,</v>

2646
01:58:38.210 --> 01:58:39.680
<v Speaker 8>it was killing him.</v>
<v Speaker 8>30,000 people a day.</v>

2647
01:58:39.681 --> 01:58:41.530
<v Speaker 8>We wouldn't be so fucking nonchalant it,</v>

2648
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:43.960
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because we're driving around,</v>

2649
01:58:43.990 --> 01:58:46.180
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the fly he doing teleportation and that</v>

2650
01:58:46.181 --> 01:58:47.250
<v Speaker 3>way you ask.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

2651
01:58:47.980 --> 01:58:52.120
<v Speaker 3>Well that was he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this was actually a remake of a really</v>

2652
01:58:52.121 --> 01:58:55.720
<v Speaker 3>old movie from the black and white days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was awesome.</v>

2653
01:58:56.260 --> 01:58:59.170
<v Speaker 3>It was really awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Go find the old fly.</v>

2654
01:58:59.220 --> 01:59:00.550
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I need to rewatch that.</v>

2655
01:59:00.551 --> 01:59:05.551
<v Speaker 3>It's but the fly,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the 19 it was at 86 88 86 for that first</v>

2656
01:59:05.711 --> 01:59:06.544
<v Speaker 3>one.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here's the other one.</v>

2657
01:59:06.550 --> 01:59:07.210
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

2658
01:59:07.210 --> 01:59:11.230
<v Speaker 3>So for the Jeff Goldbloom one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's fucking awesome.</v>

2659
01:59:11.260 --> 01:59:13.180
<v Speaker 3>It's really good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I loved it.</v>

2660
01:59:13.210 --> 01:59:16.780
<v Speaker 3>Jeff Goldbloom was such a bad</v>
<v Speaker 3>motherfucker when he was young man.</v>

2661
01:59:17.200 --> 01:59:21.040
<v Speaker 3>Especially in that movie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like I really believed that's the</v>

2662
01:59:21.041 --> 01:59:24.310
<v Speaker 3>original is that Vincent Price.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's amazing.</v>

2663
01:59:24.520 --> 01:59:28.570
<v Speaker 3>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a crazy look at the fucking</v>

2664
01:59:28.571 --> 01:59:30.220
<v Speaker 3>picture.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Oh my God.</v>

2665
01:59:30.221 --> 01:59:33.680
<v Speaker 3>Vincent Price.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was the man when it came to old</v>

2666
01:59:33.800 --> 01:59:37.360
<v Speaker 3>school monster movies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But like Jeff Goldbloom and that fly</v>

2667
01:59:37.361 --> 01:59:39.730
<v Speaker 3>movie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you believe that he was really a mad</v>

2668
01:59:39.731 --> 01:59:40.564
<v Speaker 3>scientist.</v>

2669
01:59:40.890 --> 01:59:42.610
<v Speaker 3>Like I believe like this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way he talks,</v>

2670
01:59:42.611 --> 01:59:45.040
<v Speaker 3>he's just so,</v>
<v Speaker 3>do you have friend and interesting.</v>

2671
01:59:45.380 --> 01:59:47.300
<v Speaker 3>He the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he had a way of talking about and be</v>

2672
01:59:47.301 --> 01:59:49.270
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this guy could be some hyper human who</v>

2673
01:59:49.271 --> 01:59:51.760
<v Speaker 3>could figure something like this out.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I totally bought it.</v>

2674
01:59:51.761 --> 01:59:52.720
<v Speaker 3>Hook,</v>
<v Speaker 3>line and sinker.</v>

2675
01:59:53.250 --> 01:59:56.170
<v Speaker 3>Like there's some people that play,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they play scientists and I'm like,</v>

2676
01:59:56.370 --> 01:59:58.760
<v Speaker 3>bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you ain't fucking some right.</v>

<v Speaker 3>crue and Jimi Hendrix or anyone in the</v>

2723
02:01:36.041 --> 02:01:39.530
<v Speaker 3>doors back in the day.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But I saw a band saw for the time when I</v>

2724
02:01:39.531 --> 02:01:42.380
<v Speaker 3>was a teenager in high school orgy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And Whoa,</v>

<v Speaker 3>I saw there on the billboard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I went and saw him and it was a,</v>

2726
02:01:44.840 --> 02:01:48.430
<v Speaker 3>I probably should have just stayed home.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where it led me.</v>

2727
02:01:48.830 --> 02:01:51.440
<v Speaker 3>Birthday party was great.</v>

<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

2729
02:01:54.050 --> 02:01:55.460

<v Speaker 3>an icon.</v>

2732
02:01:59.720 --> 02:02:03.320
<v Speaker 3>The rainbow feels like it was made by</v>
<v Speaker 3>the same person as the comedy store.</v>

2733
02:02:03.321 --> 02:02:06.290
<v Speaker 3>You go in there and you go like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like insane.</v>

2734
02:02:06.540 --> 02:02:09.380
<v Speaker 3>It's a legit old school,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hollywood place.</v>

2735
02:02:09.410 --> 02:02:13.340
<v Speaker 3>You ever eat at Dantanna's Dantanna's on</v>
<v Speaker 3>Santa Monica.</v>

2736
02:02:13.430 --> 02:02:16.460
<v Speaker 3>Dude.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you'll go into the past like the</v>

2737

<v Speaker 3>menus,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the way the waiters are dressed.</v>

2738
02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:21.230
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's all really small,</v>

2739
02:02:21.231 --> 02:02:23.330
<v Speaker 3>but it's not giant.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One side's more of a bar,</v>

2740
02:02:23.331 --> 02:02:25.970
<v Speaker 3>but there's tables on that side.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the food is amazing.</v>

2741
02:02:26.570 --> 02:02:29.960
<v Speaker 3>The food is incredible and it's like so</v>
<v Speaker 3>old school man.</v>

<v Speaker 3>The whole place is just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it feels it.</v>

2743
02:02:31.971 --> 02:02:33.800
<v Speaker 3>When you get in there,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you feel like you got class.</v>

2744
02:02:34.070 --> 02:02:36.110
<v Speaker 3>Like you want to order a Martini age to</v>
<v Speaker 3>be an asshole.</v>

2745
02:02:36.680 --> 02:02:40.640
<v Speaker 3>Like C'mon gentlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right next to the shipping door</v>

2746
02:02:40.641 --> 02:02:44.150
<v Speaker 3>on sunset.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Coolest place I've ever seen a concert</v>

<v Speaker 3>Why are you distracting people?</v>

2788
02:04:20.870 --> 02:04:23.780
<v Speaker 3>I think they've made it illegal in a lot</v>
<v Speaker 3>of cases.</v>

2789
02:04:23.781 --> 02:04:25.630
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think that for some,</v>

2790
02:04:25.880 --> 02:04:29.120
<v Speaker 3>some reason has like a get out of free</v>
<v Speaker 3>jail card or something.</v>

2791
02:04:29.330 --> 02:04:34.330
<v Speaker 3>Get out of free jail.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like Times Square Times Square has got</v>

<v Speaker 3>it's almost like part,</v>

2793
02:04:37.050 --> 02:04:38.280
<v Speaker 3>the charm of the place</v>

2794
02:04:38.520 --> 02:04:39.690
<v Speaker 8>that you go there.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You're just going to be,</v>

<v Speaker 8>You're not driving in that fucking</v>

2799
02:04:49.291 --> 02:04:50.910
<v Speaker 8>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>How many people go visit New York and</v>

2800
02:04:50.911 --> 02:04:52.280
<v Speaker 8>drive in Times Square?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I go,</v>

<v Speaker 8>Jesus Christ.</v>

2802
02:04:54.720 --> 02:04:58.410
<v Speaker 8>that's a giant ball of neon.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's chaos.</v>

2803
02:04:58.770 --> 02:05:01.590
<v Speaker 8>Like Vegas is the same way he received</v>
<v Speaker 8>some of those casinos.</v>

2804
02:05:01.980 --> 02:05:06.980
<v Speaker 8>They've got damn a huge movie screens</v>
<v Speaker 8>play on the outside of their casino</v>

2805
02:05:07.051 --> 02:05:11.850
<v Speaker 8>showing you people sang in fucking</v>
<v Speaker 8>rocking out carrot top and pass all this</v>

2806
02:05:11.851 --> 02:05:14.700
<v Speaker 8>shit's going on.</v>
<v Speaker 8>As you're driving down the street and</v>

2807
02:05:14.701 --> 02:05:17.640
<v Speaker 8>you're on coke and you try and drive</v>
<v Speaker 8>slow,</v>

2808
02:05:20.250 --> 02:05:23.040
<v Speaker 8>try to keep it together.</v>
<v Speaker 8>What's his fucking movie?</v>

2809
02:05:23.220 --> 02:05:26.040
<v Speaker 8>Why they show me that Cirque du Solei?</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

2810
02:05:26.670 --> 02:05:28.470
<v Speaker 8>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's something that's pretty fucking</v>

2811
02:05:28.590 --> 02:05:29.423
<v Speaker 8>specific.</v>

2812
02:05:29.670 --> 02:05:32.970
<v Speaker 8>Think about that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That show I'll give you go to Cirque de</v>

2813
02:05:32.970 --> 02:05:35.610
<v Speaker 8>Solei.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You need to see like almost superhuman</v>

2814
02:05:35.611 --> 02:05:40.200

<v Speaker 8>Like they had one of those Cirque de</v>

2815
02:05:40.200 --> 02:05:42.840
<v Speaker 8>Solei dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 8>This is like a perfect contrast to what</v>

2816
02:05:42.841 --> 02:05:44.610
<v Speaker 8>we were doing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We were,</v>

2817
02:05:44.760 --> 02:05:48.420
<v Speaker 8>we were eating over it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I guess it's like Wolfgang Puck's is</v>

2818
02:05:48.421 --> 02:05:53.421
<v Speaker 8>right over by the circus Solei place we</v>
<v Speaker 8>were eating and this dude was a coming</v>

2819
02:05:53.701 --> 02:05:58.440
<v Speaker 8>from the Cirque de Solei like he had</v>
<v Speaker 8>been working there and in the middle of</v>

2820
02:05:58.441 --> 02:06:00.480
<v Speaker 8>the hallway while we were stuffing our</v>
<v Speaker 8>face with food,</v>

2821
02:06:00.720 --> 02:06:03.840

<v Speaker 8>He did like one,</v>

2822
02:06:03.841 --> 02:06:04.770
<v Speaker 8>two,</v>
<v Speaker 8>three,</v>

2823
02:06:04.771 --> 02:06:07.800
<v Speaker 8>four,</v>
<v Speaker 8>five back lifts and Landon and laughed</v>

2824
02:06:08.100 --> 02:06:11.520
<v Speaker 8>and laughed with his friend and fucking</v>
<v Speaker 8>button up shirt and get out of there.</v>

2825
02:06:11.521 --> 02:06:14.880
<v Speaker 8>But like this dude like just flip</v>
<v Speaker 8>through the air and then it started</v>

<v Speaker 8>hotel.</v>

2887
02:08:49.640 --> 02:08:51.560
<v Speaker 8>Like no bullshit.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Hand Feed Tan.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2889
02:08:54.040 --> 02:08:56.230
<v Speaker 2>like on a diving board or water?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2890
02:08:56.380 --> 02:08:57.980
<v Speaker 8>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I've never even,</v>

2891
02:08:57.981 --> 02:09:01.010
<v Speaker 8>it's no consequences to back.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You gotta be careful.</v>

2892
02:09:02.510 --> 02:09:07.340
<v Speaker 8>I've heard my back and neck before too,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so I'm very wary about things that might</v>

2893
02:09:07.341 --> 02:09:10.310
<v Speaker 8>potentially be horrible for my fucking</v>
<v Speaker 8>spine.</v>

2894
02:09:10.730 --> 02:09:12.170
<v Speaker 8>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 8>These people are crazy.</v>

2895
02:09:14.420 --> 02:09:19.220
<v Speaker 8>It seems so strange to watch people move</v>
<v Speaker 8>their bodies in ways you know you can't</v>

2896
02:09:19.221 --> 02:09:21.260
<v Speaker 8>move yours.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like how,</v>

2897
02:09:21.320 --> 02:09:24.050
<v Speaker 8>what?</v>
<v Speaker 8>How mine don't like if you saw yourself</v>

2898
02:09:24.051 --> 02:09:24.651
<v Speaker 8>doing that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you're like,</v>

2899
02:09:24.651 --> 02:09:28.400
<v Speaker 8>how can I do this?</v>
<v Speaker 8>What do I have superhero powers now?</v>

2900
02:09:28.770 --> 02:09:31.860
<v Speaker 2>I find it more interesting watching</v>
<v Speaker 2>people doing any of these,</v>

2901
02:09:31.950 --> 02:09:35.280
<v Speaker 2>this kind of stuff in real life</v>
<v Speaker 2>situations like around the streets</v>

2902
02:09:35.281 --> 02:09:39.360
<v Speaker 2>because it's like they're ninjas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can like break into like buildings</v>

2903
02:09:39.361 --> 02:09:40.980
<v Speaker 2>just by doing this park horse shit</v>

2904
02:09:41.090 --> 02:09:41.990
<v Speaker 8>like no.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right,</v>

2905
02:09:42.020 --> 02:09:43.550
<v Speaker 8>like double jump.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I know.</v>

2906
02:09:43.551 --> 02:09:46.910
<v Speaker 8>It's weird.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's weird.</v>

2907
02:09:47.210 --> 02:09:48.890
<v Speaker 8>They can do things with their bodies at</v>
<v Speaker 8>rego.</v>

2908
02:09:48.891 --> 02:09:51.350
<v Speaker 8>People just can't,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you just keep practicing.</v>

2909
02:09:51.530 --> 02:09:53.480
<v Speaker 8>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>these are all like cement things are</v>

2910
02:09:53.481 --> 02:09:56.030
<v Speaker 8>jumping around on are they,</v>
<v Speaker 8>what are these things made out of?</v>

2911
02:09:57.280 --> 02:09:58.120
<v Speaker 8>Drywall?</v>

2913
02:10:02.361 --> 02:10:04.760
<v Speaker 8>that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That Shit has to be super flimsy.</v>

2914
02:10:05.660 --> 02:10:07.270
<v Speaker 8>They would have to be more than drywall.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Floyd.</v>

2915
02:10:07.280 --> 02:10:09.770
<v Speaker 8>It's probably like what they make a</v>
<v Speaker 8>skate ramps and stuff out of.</v>

2916
02:10:09.830 --> 02:10:11.300
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>

02:10:19.260 --> 02:10:23.490
<v Speaker 2>The future of like UFC and shit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like a room like this and that.</v>

2922
02:10:23.491 --> 02:10:27.650
<v Speaker 2>Both fighters just start on each side of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the room and they're allowed to like</v>

2923
02:10:27.670 --> 02:10:29.460
<v Speaker 2>walk around.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And do you like nature moves?</v>

2924
02:10:30.210 --> 02:10:32.480

2925
02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:34.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2928
02:10:37.450 --> 02:10:40.400
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the more sophisticated high level</v>

2929
02:10:40.401 --> 02:10:40.920
<v Speaker 4>version of it</v>

2930
02:10:40.920 --> 02:10:44.610
<v Speaker 8>and I may,</v>
<v Speaker 8>when we do it virtual reality style that</v>

2931
02:10:44.760 --> 02:10:47.850
<v Speaker 8>two guys start out in a building and you</v>
<v Speaker 8>know,</v>

2932
02:10:47.851 --> 02:10:51.660
<v Speaker 8>they don't know where the other person</v>
<v Speaker 8>is in the building and so you have to</v>

2933
02:10:51.661 --> 02:10:53.100
<v Speaker 8>like be real sneaky</v>

2934
02:10:53.210 --> 02:10:56.330
<v Speaker 4>and walk around and you're allowed to</v>
<v Speaker 4>hit the person if they don't see you.</v>

2935
02:10:56.750 --> 02:10:58.250
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It gets more realistic.</v>

2936
02:10:58.340 --> 02:11:00.140
<v Speaker 4>It's more realistic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Look at look at house,</v>

2937
02:11:01.070 --> 02:11:03.680
<v Speaker 4>look back at boxing and you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look how dumb it is.</v>

2938
02:11:03.681 --> 02:11:05.600
<v Speaker 4>They can't jump on the ground and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>can't do it.</v>

2939
02:11:05.840 --> 02:11:07.970
<v Speaker 4>Now imagine doing this and be like look</v>
<v Speaker 4>how dumb that is.</v>

2940
02:11:07.971 --> 02:11:10.070
<v Speaker 4>We're going to like an octagon.</v>

02:11:14.180 --> 02:11:16.630
<v Speaker 4>and you're using shadows on walls and</v>
<v Speaker 4>like</v>

2943
02:11:18.090 --> 02:11:21.630
<v Speaker 8>I wonder if people would give up weight</v>
<v Speaker 8>classes if they were willing to use</v>

2944
02:11:21.631 --> 02:11:24.030
<v Speaker 8>weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like if the like a,</v>

<v Speaker 8>okay look,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'll take a a 50 pound weight</v>

2946
02:11:27.181 --> 02:11:28.860
<v Speaker 8>disadvantage,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I want brass knuckles.</v>

2947
02:11:29.910 --> 02:11:30.743
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

2948
02:11:32.490 --> 02:11:36.000
<v Speaker 4>I'm remembering this TV show,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I really cannot remember the name of it,</v>

2949
02:11:36.001 --> 02:11:37.770
<v Speaker 4>but it's almost like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2950
02:11:37.771 --> 02:11:41.580
<v Speaker 4>it was like a real life really was fake,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it was like real life mortal Kombat</v>

2951
02:11:42.210 --> 02:11:45.540
<v Speaker 4>and the shot around universal studios</v>
<v Speaker 4>and they'd go to different sets and it'd</v>

2952
02:11:45.541 --> 02:11:48.900
<v Speaker 4>be like an essential area.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like this team versus team in the first</v>

2953
02:11:48.901 --> 02:11:52.140
<v Speaker 4>fight is going to be here and they'd go</v>
<v Speaker 4>like off to the lake and they'd go fight</v>

2954
02:11:52.141 --> 02:11:55.680
<v Speaker 4>at the lake and then come back</v>
<v Speaker 4>trying to look for it.</v>

2955
02:11:55.681 --> 02:11:58.290
<v Speaker 4>I have no idea what,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I totally forgot about that.</v>

2956
02:11:58.530 --> 02:12:01.600
<v Speaker 4>It's almost like you're saying,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I mean that was the wrestling wwe</v>

2957
02:12:01.770 --> 02:12:02.603
<v Speaker 4>version of</v>

2958
02:12:02.770 --> 02:12:05.380
<v Speaker 8>wow,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's right.</v>

2959
02:12:05.790 --> 02:12:06.820
<v Speaker 8>See,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there you go.</v>

2960
02:12:06.821 --> 02:12:09.670
<v Speaker 8>I'm a thief.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's how easy it is to be a thief.</v>

2961
02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:13.150
<v Speaker 8>That shit.</v>
<v Speaker 8>We were talking about something at a we</v>

2962
02:12:13.330 --> 02:12:14.920
<v Speaker 8>that's completely out of the ether.</v>

2963
02:12:15.240 --> 02:12:18.270
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I liked the idea of like what if,</v>

2964
02:12:18.330 --> 02:12:20.490
<v Speaker 4>what if it was like the real world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Every,</v>

2965
02:12:20.491 --> 02:12:22.650
<v Speaker 4>there's a camera in every room and you</v>
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>

2966
02:12:22.920 --> 02:12:26.280
<v Speaker 4>one person's is started in the attic,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one person started in the basement and</v>

2967
02:12:26.281 --> 02:12:28.010
<v Speaker 4>you're trying to kill the other,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2968
02:12:28.030 --> 02:12:30.840
<v Speaker 4>like beat up.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I think there's gotta be an element</v>

2969
02:12:30.841 --> 02:12:31.290
<v Speaker 4>of virtual [inaudible]</v>

2970
02:12:31.290 --> 02:12:33.240
<v Speaker 8>reality like to,</v>
<v Speaker 8>for to watch it.</v>

2971
02:12:33.270 --> 02:12:34.350
<v Speaker 8>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>cause we can't be there.</v>

2972
02:12:34.351 --> 02:12:36.630
<v Speaker 8>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But to watch it and get the best angles,</v>

2973
02:12:36.750 --> 02:12:39.870
<v Speaker 8>you should be able to watch the</v>
<v Speaker 8>perspective of both people.</v>

2974
02:12:39.900 --> 02:12:41.880
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The perspective of the guy doing the</v>

2975
02:12:41.881 --> 02:12:44.190
<v Speaker 8>beating up and their perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The Guy Getting beat up,</v>

2976
02:12:44.220 --> 02:12:47.640
<v Speaker 8>the perspective of the guy that doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 8>know the guys behind him and the</v>

2977
02:12:47.641 --> 02:12:51.060
<v Speaker 8>perspective of the guy who knows that</v>
<v Speaker 8>the guy doesn't know and he's sneaking</v>

2999
02:13:49.850 --> 02:13:50.600
<v Speaker 4>disconnection.</v>

3000
02:13:50.600 --> 02:13:54.710
<v Speaker 1>Do we have to make an upgrade?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there anything we need to do?</v>

3001
02:13:54.920 --> 02:13:55.753
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

3002
02:13:55.970 --> 02:13:59.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Should we upgrade our system the best</v>

<v Speaker 1>you can get you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he really can't get any better than I</v>

<v Speaker 1>we can do it at the level that he's been</v>

3006
02:14:06.231 --> 02:14:07.700
<v Speaker 1>doing it right now with something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

3007
02:14:07.730 --> 02:14:09.740
<v Speaker 1>You don't want it to be more complicated</v>
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>

3008
02:14:09.741 --> 02:14:10.670
<v Speaker 1>It's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3009
02:14:10.940 --> 02:14:13.640
<v Speaker 1>That thing's perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just fucks up every now and then</v>

3010
02:14:13.670 --> 02:14:15.440
<v Speaker 1>and then it makes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gives us something to bitch about.</v>

3011
02:14:16.110 --> 02:14:17.780
<v Speaker 1>Fucking truck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

3012
02:14:19.730 --> 02:14:21.360
<v Speaker 1>I don't know man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those things a,</v>

3013
02:14:21.390 --> 02:14:23.780
<v Speaker 1>they're complicated as fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to shit out on you every</v>

3014
02:14:23.781 --> 02:14:25.640
<v Speaker 1>now and then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's just,</v>

3015
02:14:25.700 --> 02:14:27.460
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're streaming things and h d</v>

3016
02:14:27.630 --> 02:14:30.750
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mkbhd he stopped by here one time he's</v>

3017
02:14:30.780 --> 02:14:31.980
<v Speaker 4>making,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he makes those cool uh,</v>

3018
02:14:32.070 --> 02:14:33.930
<v Speaker 4>youtube videos sort of like unbox</v>
<v Speaker 4>therapy.</v>

3019
02:14:33.931 --> 02:14:36.660
<v Speaker 4>I think he's friends with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He made a cool video recently talking</v>

3020
02:14:36.661 --> 02:14:40.980
<v Speaker 4>about four k and the state of it now and</v>
<v Speaker 4>kind of like where we are.</v>

3021
02:14:41.010 --> 02:14:43.800
<v Speaker 4>And like you can watch four K on a TV</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that.</v>

3022
02:14:44.270 --> 02:14:45.870
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can watch some of it on your phone,</v>

3023
02:14:45.871 --> 02:14:49.470
<v Speaker 4>but really you can only get it from like</v>
<v Speaker 4>Netflix and youtube and it's going to</v>

3024
02:14:49.471 --> 02:14:52.710
<v Speaker 4>take a long time before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like it would take what happened for us</v>

3025
02:14:52.711 --> 02:14:55.500
<v Speaker 4>to get really good Internet here.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You have to dig up the ground but in</v>

3026
02:14:55.501 --> 02:14:57.450
<v Speaker 4>some new cables to get the bandwidth to</v>
<v Speaker 4>go.</v>

3027
02:14:57.570 --> 02:14:59.340
<v Speaker 4>Cause it's a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a lot of information you're trying</v>

3028
02:14:59.341 --> 02:15:03.450
<v Speaker 4>to send even were like fixed the math of</v>
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

3029
02:15:03.451 --> 02:15:05.860
<v Speaker 4>That compression can easily be fixed by</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3030
02:15:05.910 --> 02:15:08.130
<v Speaker 4>like a jpeg version of four,</v>
<v Speaker 4>four K,</v>

3031
02:15:08.131 --> 02:15:09.790
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like something that compresses fourcade</v>

3032
02:15:09.870 --> 02:15:13.200
<v Speaker 4>down into something that you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it would have the same image</v>

3033
02:15:13.201 --> 02:15:13.890
<v Speaker 4>quality.</v>

3034
02:15:13.890 --> 02:15:16.950
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean like look at bitmaps and jpegs.</v>

3035
02:15:16.951 --> 02:15:19.560
<v Speaker 4>He can't tell the difference between</v>
<v Speaker 4>those two but one with the naked eye.</v>

3036
02:15:20.270 --> 02:15:23.210
<v Speaker 4>But can you tell if you're looking at it</v>
<v Speaker 4>through a lens or anything like that?</v>

3037
02:15:23.211 --> 02:15:26.190
<v Speaker 4>Like the people that are really a t</v>
<v Speaker 4>mobile just got in trouble recently</v>

3038
02:15:26.240 --> 02:15:31.240
<v Speaker 4>because uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because unlimited data or whatever for</v>

3039
02:15:32.621 --> 02:15:34.370
<v Speaker 4>that unlimited,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3040
02:15:34.410 --> 02:15:36.540
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what they do is they downgrade it to for</v>

3041
02:15:36.541 --> 02:15:39.150
<v Speaker 4>ADP.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you're on your phone watching</v>

<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

3053
02:16:14.870 --> 02:16:17.150
<v Speaker 1>the new galaxy phones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think this is the,</v>

3054
02:16:17.151 --> 02:16:21.020
<v Speaker 1>the first series of galaxy phones or</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have features that are sort of</v>

3055
02:16:21.021 --> 02:16:23.570
<v Speaker 1>built in that make you go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

3056
02:16:24.350 --> 02:16:27.110
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all have charging a wireless</v>

3057
02:16:27.111 --> 02:16:27.944
<v Speaker 1>charging now.</v>

3058
02:16:28.810 --> 02:16:29.740
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>

3059
02:16:30.110 --> 02:16:30.941

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

3060
02:16:30.941 --> 02:16:31.601
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

3061
02:16:31.601 --> 02:16:35.440
<v Speaker 1>what I've noticed with white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with wireless charging is that it</v>

3062
02:16:35.441 --> 02:16:40.441
<v Speaker 1>charges slow and sometimes you'll put</v>
<v Speaker 1>your phone on the little dock thing and</v>

3063
02:16:41.291 --> 02:16:43.570
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't sit right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you don't have a charge.</v>

3064
02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:44.920
<v Speaker 1>And so then you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the fuck?</v>

3065
02:16:46.180 --> 02:16:47.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still there right now.</v>

3066
02:16:47.501 --> 02:16:49.240
<v Speaker 1>There's a company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I forget who it is,</v>

3067
02:16:49.241 --> 02:16:54.241
<v Speaker 1>I think it's apple that just filed a</v>
<v Speaker 1>patent for wireless charging for like,</v>

3068
02:16:54.430 --> 02:16:55.660
<v Speaker 1>like going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3069
02:16:56.450 --> 02:16:58.390
<v Speaker 1>We like to be able to breathe the air</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's going to be filled with</v>

3070
02:16:58.391 --> 02:17:01.160
<v Speaker 1>electrical currents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's that possible about dude?</v>

3071
02:17:01.680 --> 02:17:04.530
<v Speaker 1>250,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 billion gallons of methane are being</v>

3072
02:17:04.531 --> 02:17:05.970
<v Speaker 1>pumped in the air.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

3073
02:17:05.971 --> 02:17:08.970
<v Speaker 1>And that's floating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How many pounds of Wifi we eating right</v>

3074
02:17:08.971 --> 02:17:12.000
<v Speaker 1>now while we're eating this podcast?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's what's going on with</v>

3075
02:17:12.001 --> 02:17:14.070
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're so overweight because we're eating</v>

3076
02:17:14.071 --> 02:17:14.904
<v Speaker 1>wifi.</v>

3077
02:17:15.060 --> 02:17:18.330
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my new theory or eating Wifi and four g</v>

3078
02:17:18.331 --> 02:17:21.090
<v Speaker 4>lte,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the only thing it's doing is making more</v>

3079
02:17:21.091 --> 02:17:24.360
<v Speaker 4>autistic people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were okay with three g up to three g</v>

3080
02:17:24.361 --> 02:17:26.490
<v Speaker 4>and then we fell apart.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're just eating too much.</v>

3081
02:17:28.010 --> 02:17:28.843
<v Speaker 1>It's weight</v>

3082
02:17:30.910 --> 02:17:33.640
<v Speaker 4>and autism.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What do you think it gives people autism</v>

3083
02:17:34.400 --> 02:17:35.260
<v Speaker 4>series?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3084
02:17:36.100 --> 02:17:39.230
<v Speaker 4>I think there's something to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or autism is just on the rise at cry</v>

3085
02:17:39.750 --> 02:17:41.260
<v Speaker 4>like so hot right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like,</v>

3086
02:17:41.261 --> 02:17:43.380
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

3087
02:17:43.381 --> 02:17:44.350
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but yeah,</v>

3088
02:17:44.720 --> 02:17:46.910
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a bunch of different</v>
<v Speaker 1>causes that they think,</v>

3089
02:17:46.940 --> 02:17:48.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they think genetics.</v>

3090
02:17:49.010 --> 02:17:52.850
<v Speaker 1>They think people when they get older</v>
<v Speaker 1>and have children much more likely,</v>

3091
02:17:53.050 --> 02:17:55.310
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the children are going to have</v>

3092
02:17:55.311 --> 02:17:58.640
<v Speaker 1>autism becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they become much more susceptible as the</v>

3093
02:17:58.760 --> 02:18:02.360
<v Speaker 1>parents get like older and older.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like directly proportionate they</v>

3094
02:18:02.361 --> 02:18:04.250
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's a lot of questions.</v>

3095
02:18:04.640 --> 02:18:09.640
<v Speaker 1>But what causes it or and whether or not</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more prevalent today or whether the</v>

3096
02:18:09.771 --> 02:18:12.770
<v Speaker 1>diagnosing of it is more prevalent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe that's,</v>

3097
02:18:13.280 --> 02:18:14.820
<v Speaker 1>that's debatable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3098
02:18:14.970 --> 02:18:17.990
<v Speaker 1>you know when there's more people today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so obviously there's going to be more</v>

3099
02:18:17.991 --> 02:18:20.030
<v Speaker 1>cases of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but are they the same percentage of</v>

3100
02:18:20.031 --> 02:18:22.340
<v Speaker 1>cases?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like one of the things that they've</v>

3101
02:18:22.341 --> 02:18:27.341
<v Speaker 1>always tried to correlate is marijuana</v>
<v Speaker 1>with schizophrenia and the problems that</v>

3102
02:18:27.711 --> 02:18:30.230
<v Speaker 1>were exposed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think in the culture high they had</v>

3103
02:18:30.231 --> 02:18:34.790
<v Speaker 1>this where they were saying that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>instances of schizophrenia have been</v>

3104
02:18:35.180 --> 02:18:37.720
<v Speaker 1>uniform throughout history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we,</v>

3105
02:18:37.730 --> 02:18:40.220
<v Speaker 1>we monitoring it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like 1% of the population,</v>

3106
02:18:40.550 --> 02:18:45.140
<v Speaker 1>100% of the population skids phrenic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like just because that 1% may or may not</v>

3107
02:18:45.141 --> 02:18:46.110
<v Speaker 1>have smoked marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

3108
02:18:46.111 --> 02:18:48.800
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't raise it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When marijuana becomes more popular.</v>

3109
02:18:48.920 --> 02:18:52.220
<v Speaker 1>When it gets used more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still stays at 1% it doesn't seem</v>

3110
02:18:52.221 --> 02:18:55.820
<v Speaker 1>to vary from one person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just 1% deviation.</v>

3111
02:18:55.821 --> 02:18:59.690
<v Speaker 1>It's like the quality control of God is</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the best in the world.</v>

3112
02:19:00.700 --> 02:19:01.511
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's weird.</v>

3113
02:19:01.511 --> 02:19:03.690
<v Speaker 4>I think it's mushrooms is an acid and</v>
<v Speaker 4>psychedelics,</v>

3114
02:19:03.691 --> 02:19:05.830
<v Speaker 4>I would actually speed ups,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that kind of stuff.</v>

3115
02:19:05.930 --> 02:19:06.551
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

3116
02:19:06.551 --> 02:19:06.960
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>

3117

<v Speaker 4>some of them unfortunately,</v>

3124
02:19:29.030 --> 02:19:30.230
<v Speaker 8>unfortunately.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Hi is that,</v>

3125
02:19:30.260 --> 02:19:33.080
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>Tony Tony's era from Columbus number</v>

3126
02:19:33.081 --> 02:19:38.081
<v Speaker 8>Tony Krantz a turtle turtle had always</v>
<v Speaker 8>the best fucking explanation for that.</v>

3127
02:19:39.380 --> 02:19:40.520
<v Speaker 8>He,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he like,</v>

3128
02:19:40.521 --> 02:19:43.970
<v Speaker 8>he made some play of words with</v>
<v Speaker 8>psychotic and neurotic and Louise always</v>

3129
02:19:43.971 --> 02:19:45.290
<v Speaker 8>talk about it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it's so true.</v>

3130
02:19:45.291 --> 02:19:47.930
<v Speaker 8>Like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's the common theme that everybody</v>

3131
02:19:47.931 --> 02:19:50.450
<v Speaker 8>always says,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like the crazy girls are the best in</v>

3132
02:19:50.451 --> 02:19:51.710
<v Speaker 8>bed.</v>
<v Speaker 8>True.</v>

3133
02:19:51.800 --> 02:19:53.810

<v Speaker 8>the best in bed,</v>

3134
02:19:53.811 --> 02:19:57.980
<v Speaker 8>which is why dirty dancing was so</v>
<v Speaker 8>appealing to young ladies in the 1980s.</v>

3135
02:19:58.250 --> 02:19:59.900

<v Speaker 8>nothing wrong with playboy folks.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Nothing wrong with naked bodies,</v>

3274
02:27:05.230 --> 02:27:06.880
<v Speaker 8>but there's nothing wrong with porn</v>
<v Speaker 8>either,</v>

3275
02:27:07.450 --> 02:27:09.100
<v Speaker 8>but we're not there yet.</v>

<v Speaker 8>I mean that's like,</v>

3282
02:27:26.400 --> 02:27:28.630
<v Speaker 8>do you think that better cooking can</v>
<v Speaker 8>save food?</v>

3286
02:27:33.731 --> 02:27:36.790

<v Speaker 8>I think in a lot of ways what's going to</v>

3287
02:27:36.791 --> 02:27:41.350
<v Speaker 8>happen with some of the artists that</v>
<v Speaker 8>kind of use the most respectful term</v>

3288
02:27:41.351 --> 02:27:44.050
<v Speaker 8>possible is a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they can make personal appearances,</v>

3289
02:27:44.090 --> 02:27:45.460
<v Speaker 8>they can make a ton of money doing that.</v>

3290
02:27:45.520 --> 02:27:49.330
<v Speaker 8>Like sort of like a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like almost like musicians that don't</v>

3291
02:27:49.331 --> 02:27:53.800
<v Speaker 8>sell too many cds now.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like it's hard other than apple maybe to</v>

<v Speaker 8>okay.</v>

3299
02:28:11.210 --> 02:28:13.480

02:28:13.481 --> 02:28:16.960
<v Speaker 8>activate so they know it's you and not</v>
<v Speaker 8>someone using your phone that knows your</v>

3304
02:28:23.210 --> 02:28:25.700
<v Speaker 1>They should do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know they're stupid not to do it.</v>

3305
02:28:25.730 --> 02:28:28.160
<v Speaker 1>You could buy it then the actors can get</v>
<v Speaker 1>paid.</v>

3349
02:30:14.991 --> 02:30:18.110
<v Speaker 1>get tested randomly at work and it would</v>
<v Speaker 1>cost them their job.</v>

3350
02:30:18.470 --> 02:30:20.320
<v Speaker 1>You get fired,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if you get,</v>

3351

02:30:30.140 --> 02:30:33.140
<v Speaker 1>Do you really think they're going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>affected by that joint?</v>

3356
02:30:33.141 --> 02:30:34.160
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>

3357
02:30:34.161 --> 02:30:38.060

<v Speaker 1>They're going to test positive.</v>

3358
02:30:38.300 --> 02:30:39.770
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the same thing.</v>

3359
02:30:40.220 --> 02:30:42.020
<v Speaker 1>It's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like your boss is telling you</v>

3360
02:30:42.021 --> 02:30:45.410
<v Speaker 1>mentally to stay put.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's the same thing.</v>

3361
02:30:45.920 --> 02:30:47.620
<v Speaker 1>That's what they're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to have to do that.</v>

3362
02:30:47.621 --> 02:30:49.280
<v Speaker 1>I remember I would smoke weed and I'm</v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

3363
02:30:49.281 --> 02:30:50.420
<v Speaker 1>Goddamn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I smoked weed.</v>

3364
02:30:50.421 --> 02:30:53.060
<v Speaker 1>Now I better not get tested in the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of weeks.</v>

3365
02:30:53.060 --> 02:30:55.790
<v Speaker 1>I would like freaking out looking at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>calendar like shit and they can have a</v>

3366
02:30:55.791 --> 02:30:58.730
<v Speaker 1>zero tolerance policy I think of write</v>
<v Speaker 1>it into their contract cause it's an</v>

3367
02:30:58.731 --> 02:31:02.120
<v Speaker 1>illegal drug and they just fire you man</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you,</v>

3368
02:31:02.130 --> 02:31:04.070
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could have totally non-psychoactive</v>

3369
02:31:04.400 --> 02:31:06.080
<v Speaker 1>levels in your system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't matter.</v>

3370
02:31:06.260 --> 02:31:09.230
<v Speaker 1>Totally sober.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also there's no science that backs</v>

3371
02:31:09.231 --> 02:31:11.290
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's long term effects of you know</v>

3372
02:31:11.420 --> 02:31:15.320
<v Speaker 1>you smoke a joint on Friday night and</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know on Monday morning some sort of</v>

3373
02:31:15.321 --> 02:31:19.740
<v Speaker 1>a long term it does nothing and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by eight and if there is judge the</v>

3374
02:31:19.741 --> 02:31:21.570
<v Speaker 1>person based on their performance at</v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

3375
02:31:21.750 --> 02:31:22.690
<v Speaker 1>don't you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

3376
02:31:22.691 --> 02:31:24.510
<v Speaker 1>you can't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone's not doing their job at</v>

3377
02:31:24.511 --> 02:31:27.060
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's why they check each other</v>

3378
02:31:27.061 --> 02:31:30.120
<v Speaker 1>out and that's why they have assessments</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stuff and that's why you have</v>

3379
02:31:30.121 --> 02:31:32.130
<v Speaker 1>meetings with your supervisors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what that's for.</v>

3380
02:31:32.400 --> 02:31:33.590
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't nothing to do with what,</v>

3381
02:31:33.730 --> 02:31:38.100
<v Speaker 1>like one person could be a fucking moron</v>
<v Speaker 1>and never touch a drop of alcohol and</v>

3382
02:31:38.101 --> 02:31:40.410
<v Speaker 1>never smoke and never do anything their</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole life.</v>

3383
02:31:40.590 --> 02:31:43.230
<v Speaker 1>And they can be a fucking moron.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't get Brownie points,</v>

3384
02:31:43.231 --> 02:31:45.870
<v Speaker 1>you'll get extra points for not doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs.</v>

3385
02:31:45.900 --> 02:31:48.510
<v Speaker 1>You just don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what happens when the guy</v>

3386
02:31:48.511 --> 02:31:49.470
<v Speaker 1>does?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is he okay?</v>

3387
02:31:49.471 --> 02:31:51.720
<v Speaker 1>What if he has a couple of drinks on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Friday and,</v>

3388

<v Speaker 1>he shows up Monday morning,</v>

3389
02:31:53.011 --> 02:31:55.770
<v Speaker 1>fresh as a daisy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He worked out at the gym at five 30 and</v>

3390
02:31:55.771 --> 02:31:57.330
<v Speaker 1>he's fucking here ready to rock and</v>
<v Speaker 1>roll.</v>

3391
02:31:57.540 --> 02:31:58.950
<v Speaker 1>What do you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you give a fuck?</v>

3392
02:31:59.490 --> 02:32:03.180
<v Speaker 1>Like it's stupid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a stupid like distinction to put on</v>

3393
02:32:03.181 --> 02:32:06.300
<v Speaker 1>someone to think that somehow or another</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's bad.</v>

3394
02:32:06.520 --> 02:32:07.353
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3395
02:32:08.360 --> 02:32:12.080

3397
02:32:13.760 --> 02:32:15.320
<v Speaker 4>So like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and theoretically,</v>

3398
02:32:15.321 --> 02:32:18.680
<v Speaker 4>I guess you'd go get high and take two</v>
<v Speaker 4>weeks off and come back and be fuck</v>

3406
02:32:36.770 --> 02:32:38.220

<v Speaker 1>And I like,</v>

3407
02:32:38.260 --> 02:32:40.790
<v Speaker 1>it's crazy that it's all based on a true</v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

3408
02:32:40.970 --> 02:32:45.970
<v Speaker 1>Pablo Escobar was insane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like you got to watch this series folks,</v>

3409
02:32:46.251 --> 02:32:49.880
<v Speaker 1>you got to watch this series because</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all based on real events and you</v>

3410
02:32:49.881 --> 02:32:54.881
<v Speaker 1>realize how unbelievably insane Escobar</v>
<v Speaker 1>was and the amount of power and money</v>

3411
02:32:56.271 --> 02:32:58.010
<v Speaker 1>that guy at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>

3412
02:32:58.011 --> 02:33:03.011
<v Speaker 1>It's beyond imagination and they did</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a great job of building up the</v>

3413
02:33:03.651 --> 02:33:07.940
<v Speaker 1>production of showing like how they</v>
<v Speaker 1>started making it and selling it and</v>

3414
02:33:07.941 --> 02:33:10.880
<v Speaker 1>showing the impact of it and fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's good.</v>

3415
02:33:11.570 --> 02:33:12.180
<v Speaker 1>Fuck it.</v>

3416
02:33:12.180 --> 02:33:13.950
<v Speaker 4>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Did you hear about the guy in Miami who</v>

3417
02:33:13.951 --> 02:33:17.220
<v Speaker 4>recently bought a house and when they</v>
<v Speaker 4>were excavating some of the property,</v>

3418
02:33:17.221 --> 02:33:20.160
<v Speaker 4>they found a safe and it was Pablo</v>
<v Speaker 4>Escobar's former house.</v>

3419
02:33:20.280 --> 02:33:23.580
<v Speaker 4>Oh Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The press and the first safe got stolen</v>

3420
02:33:23.790 --> 02:33:26.100
<v Speaker 4>and they found a second safe and they</v>
<v Speaker 4>told the press again.</v>

3421
02:33:26.101 --> 02:33:28.750
<v Speaker 4>I don't think it's not being kept</v>
<v Speaker 4>somewhere so they can,</v>

3422
02:33:28.850 --> 02:33:30.990
<v Speaker 4>I don't think they've opened it or found</v>
<v Speaker 4>out what's in it,</v>

3423
02:33:30.991 --> 02:33:33.530
<v Speaker 4>but as an asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 4>keep your mouth shut son.</v>

<v Speaker 4>Where do you get a friend?</v>

3426
02:33:41.700 --> 02:33:44.820
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if that money's flagged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3427
02:33:45.120 --> 02:33:47.010
<v Speaker 1>probably if there's money in it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's gold.</v>

3428
02:33:47.011 --> 02:33:48.300
<v Speaker 1>Open up the safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's just,</v>

3429
02:33:48.330 --> 02:33:50.190
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mother saves heads.</v>
