00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.900
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches,</v>

2
00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.710
<v Speaker 1>and I thought I had lost that and I,</v>

3
00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.450
<v Speaker 1>I was at a point in my life where,</v>

4
00:00:08.451 --> 00:00:08.931
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

5
00:00:08.931 --> 00:00:11.960
<v Speaker 1>I was where I wanted to be doing what I was wanting to do.</v>

6
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.200
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was doing it right and I mean it.</v>

7
00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.010
<v Speaker 1>I thought I was going to die in 36 hours after getting shot.</v>

8
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:24.490
<v Speaker 1>I got off the stairs of an airplane in Virginia beach and my wife had my son in</v>

9
00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:26.470
<v Speaker 1>a stroller and was pregnant with my second,</v>

10
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:27.313
<v Speaker 1>my middle son.</v>

11
00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.450
<v Speaker 1>It just was such a bizarre series of events that happened so quickly and I went</v>

12
00:00:32.451 --> 00:00:34.400
<v Speaker 1>from going so fast to nowhere,</v>

13
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:35.870
<v Speaker 1>to having nothing to do,</v>

14
00:00:35.871 --> 00:00:39.560
<v Speaker 1>to not understanding why I couldn't train my body to get back to where I was</v>

15
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.530
<v Speaker 1>because the only job I'd had in my adult life other than working for my father,</v>

16
00:00:42.531 --> 00:00:43.364
<v Speaker 1>I had too much.</v>

17
00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.730
<v Speaker 1>I had too much invested in that occupational title and I think one of the best</v>

18
00:00:49.461 --> 00:00:52.820
<v Speaker 1>things that I was able to do in my military career was to survive it and get out</v>

19
00:00:52.821 --> 00:00:53.654
<v Speaker 1>and to move on.</v>

20
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.600
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the hardest things for fighters as well.</v>

21
00:00:56.601 --> 00:00:59.330
<v Speaker 2>It's a big thing with them and may fighters boxers too.</v>

22
00:00:59.331 --> 00:01:00.890
<v Speaker 2>They just don't know what to do when it's over.</v>

23
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.820
<v Speaker 2>They have.</v>

24
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.820
<v Speaker 2>They become these incredible winners in this one avenue and then once that's</v>

25
00:01:07.521 --> 00:01:07.960
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>

26
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.580
<v Speaker 1>they rarely achieved that same kind of success in anything else where they're</v>

27
00:01:12.581 --> 00:01:14.170
<v Speaker 1>probably not thinking about anything else.</v>

28
00:01:14.171 --> 00:01:15.190
<v Speaker 1>When in the middle of fighting,</v>

29
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.960
<v Speaker 1>which is very common with people in the military too,</v>

30
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.520
<v Speaker 1>because the job does require a very focused,</v>

31
00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.190
<v Speaker 1>myopic sense of drive.</v>

32
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.660
<v Speaker 1>This is what you need to do,</v>

33
00:01:25.661 --> 00:01:26.800
<v Speaker 1>especially in the seal teams.</v>

34
00:01:26.801 --> 00:01:27.880
<v Speaker 1>It's the team comes first,</v>

35
00:01:27.881 --> 00:01:28.361
<v Speaker 1>team gear,</v>

36
00:01:28.361 --> 00:01:28.961
<v Speaker 1>personal gear.</v>

37
00:01:28.961 --> 00:01:30.070
<v Speaker 1>Then take care of yourself,</v>

38
00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.280
<v Speaker 1>worried more about the person to your left into the right and then worry about</v>

39
00:01:33.281 --> 00:01:34.114
<v Speaker 1>yourself,</v>

40
00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:34.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

41
00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.750
<v Speaker 1>consider the impacts of your actions and your words on the people around you and</v>

42
00:01:37.751 --> 00:01:38.381
<v Speaker 1>then on yourself.</v>

43
00:01:38.381 --> 00:01:39.214
<v Speaker 1>So it's very.</v>

44
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.810
<v Speaker 1>It is very driven down into a laser like focused,</v>

45
00:01:43.811 --> 00:01:46.720
<v Speaker 1>but that's also required to survive and thrive in those environments.</v>

46
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.220
<v Speaker 1>But if left unchecked,</v>

47
00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.540
<v Speaker 1>you'll end up at the end of your career not prepared for the next phase of your</v>

48
00:01:52.541 --> 00:01:54.430
<v Speaker 1>life and say you do 20 years in the military,</v>

49
00:01:54.431 --> 00:01:56.170
<v Speaker 1>which is what you need to do to get to retirement.</v>

50
00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:57.820
<v Speaker 1>You joined when you're 18,</v>

51
00:01:57.821 --> 00:01:58.181
<v Speaker 1>so hey,</v>

52
00:01:58.181 --> 00:01:58.901
<v Speaker 1>you're 38.</v>

53
00:01:58.901 --> 00:02:01.000
<v Speaker 1>Well the average lifespan of American is what?</v>

54
00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:01.451
<v Speaker 1>80,</v>

55
00:02:01.451 --> 00:02:02.284
<v Speaker 1>85.</v>

56
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.670
<v Speaker 1>You got a lot of time left.</v>

57
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.073
<v Speaker 1>What do you do?</v>

58
00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.730
<v Speaker 1>And if you haven't thought about it,</v>

59
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:08.380
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

60
00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:09.640
<v Speaker 1>it's it.</v>

61
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.840
<v Speaker 1>As see guys who struggle.</v>

62
00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.180
<v Speaker 1>I see guys and I struggled myself,</v>

63
00:02:13.181 --> 00:02:14.160
<v Speaker 1>but I think I,</v>

64
00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.260
<v Speaker 1>I think I went through that struggle while I was still in and I think that</v>

65
00:02:19.511 --> 00:02:23.680
<v Speaker 1>struggle allow me to lift my chin up just a little bit to look around and start</v>

66
00:02:23.681 --> 00:02:24.580
<v Speaker 1>thinking about the future.</v>

67
00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.110
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

68
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.640
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot of shows that turns out like,</v>

69
00:02:27.641 --> 00:02:27.881
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

70
00:02:27.881 --> 00:02:30.130
<v Speaker 2>this is a four seasons of this that you never heard of it.</v>

71
00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.600
<v Speaker 2>Like maybe it's just me,</v>

72
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.201
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'm that.</v>

73
00:02:32.201 --> 00:02:35.350
<v Speaker 2>And it's totally possible because there's always some fucking new musical</v>

74
00:02:35.351 --> 00:02:36.190
<v Speaker 2>artists and like,</v>

00:02:36.191 --> 00:02:37.060
<v Speaker 2>well who the fuck is that?</v>

76
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:38.320
<v Speaker 2>And I'll go to their instagram page.</v>

77
00:02:38.321 --> 00:02:40.210

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.173
<v Speaker 2>Triggered a,</v>

86
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.560
<v Speaker 2>stopped the show.</v>

87
00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.761
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

90
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 2>this</v>

91
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.371

94
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:05.920
<v Speaker 3>I don't know any of it.</v>

95
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.360
<v Speaker 3>And I'm about to say,</v>

96
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:07.601
<v Speaker 3>hey,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you don't have to play this for us.</v>

98
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.900
<v Speaker 3>But then I saw him lip sinking to the lyrics and tapping his fingers.</v>

99
00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.500
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

100
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.460

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:00.640
<v Speaker 3>Jimmy luxury.</v>

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:02.201
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

132
00:04:02.201 --> 00:04:04.330
<v Speaker 3>it's from like 1997.</v>

133
00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.790
<v Speaker 3>It was on the soundtrack of a movie go and then they disappeared.</v>

134
00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:12.310
<v Speaker 3>You can't even find where the band is now,</v>

135
00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:13.990
<v Speaker 3>but it was on a corona commercial.</v>

136
00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.230
<v Speaker 3>I love it and I use it as intro music all the time.</v>

137
00:04:17.231 --> 00:04:18.100
<v Speaker 3>That pumps me up.</v>

138
00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:21.280
<v Speaker 3>They go sing a song.</v>

139
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.360
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

140
00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.193
<v Speaker 3>give me some volume.</v>

141
00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.801
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

142
00:04:26.801 --> 00:04:28.180
<v Speaker 3>I'm just seeing the video on</v>

143
00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.641
<v Speaker 4>mute.</v>

144
00:04:28.641 --> 00:04:29.570
<v Speaker 4>I'm into their song.</v>

145
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:32.840
<v Speaker 4>This is great.</v>

146
00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.940
<v Speaker 4>Headphones.</v>

147
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:37.773
<v Speaker 4>This is great.</v>

148
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.100
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

149
00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.160
<v Speaker 4>just know that I love you.</v>

150
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.060
<v Speaker 4>Always.</v>

151
00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.893
<v Speaker 4>They.</v>

152
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:54.420
<v Speaker 4>I like how these gals are dressed like they're 19 fifties.</v>

153
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.710
<v Speaker 4>Cover girls.</v>

154
00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:57.570
<v Speaker 4>What is it about that look</v>

155
00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.071
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

156
00:04:58.071 --> 00:05:00.320
<v Speaker 3>That like cover pinup girl.</v>

157
00:05:00.321 --> 00:05:01.100
<v Speaker 3>That's what it's called.</v>

158
00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.880
<v Speaker 3>Nineteen fifties.</v>

159
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.290
<v Speaker 3>Pinup girl type of look.</v>

160
00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:05.230
<v Speaker 3>What is it about that feeling appealing?</v>

161
00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.700
<v Speaker 3>Maybe it makes fat chicks look good.</v>

162
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.000
<v Speaker 3>Dare you doug.</v>

163
00:05:11.001 --> 00:05:11.510
<v Speaker 3>Stan hope.</v>

164
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.000
<v Speaker 3>Do you not realize it was a different day and age?</v>

165
00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.340
<v Speaker 3>You can't say that anymore.</v>

166
00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:17.840
<v Speaker 3>Those days are done.</v>

167
00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.030
<v Speaker 3>What's wrong with a fat girl looking good?</v>

168
00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.841
<v Speaker 3>What's wrong with you?</v>

169
00:05:20.841 --> 00:05:21.674
<v Speaker 3>You wait.</v>

170
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.600
<v Speaker 3>It was,</v>

171
00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:25.341
<v Speaker 3>it's a great thing.</v>

172
00:05:25.341 --> 00:05:25.861
<v Speaker 3>And it still is.</v>

173
00:05:25.861 --> 00:05:25.980
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

174
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:26.161
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

175
00:05:26.161 --> 00:05:27.300
<v Speaker 3>I still write songs for people.</v>

176
00:05:27.301 --> 00:05:30.870
<v Speaker 3>I still write with people when they asked me to do that for because it's cool to</v>

177
00:05:30.871 --> 00:05:35.220
<v Speaker 3>get into somebody else's head or a kind of sit down with them and,</v>

178
00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:39.030
<v Speaker 3>and try to help them realize some vision of what it is they want to do.</v>

179
00:05:39.031 --> 00:05:42.020
<v Speaker 3>And that's still one of my favorite things to do and I,</v>

180
00:05:42.021 --> 00:05:45.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm just as interested in that as I am and,</v>

181
00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.380
<v Speaker 3>and doing my own thing.</v>

182
00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.301
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

183
00:05:47.301 --> 00:05:49.610
<v Speaker 3>So when you learn how to write music,</v>

184
00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:50.600
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

185
00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.433
<v Speaker 3>did you,</v>

186
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:53.320
<v Speaker 3>when you would write what you,</v>

187
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.010
<v Speaker 3>do you sit down with an idea in mind with a guitar?</v>

188
00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.850
<v Speaker 3>Do you sit down with a pen and pad?</v>

189
00:05:58.851 --> 00:05:59.450
<v Speaker 3>Like how do you,</v>

190
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:00.770
<v Speaker 3>how do you write songs?</v>

191
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.670
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

192
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:05.150
<v Speaker 3>if I'm riding by myself or with somebody because there's a lot of different</v>

193
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:05.721
<v Speaker 3>processes,</v>

194
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:06.554
<v Speaker 3>it can be,</v>

195
00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:07.431
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

196
00:06:07.431 --> 00:06:09.020
<v Speaker 3>whatever comes up that day for me.</v>

197
00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:11.060
<v Speaker 3>Generally if I just going to say,</v>

198
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.271
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

199
00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:13.520
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to sit down and go over in that corner and write a song,</v>

200
00:06:13.521 --> 00:06:14.360
<v Speaker 3>I'd have a guitar,</v>

201
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:18.410
<v Speaker 3>I'd probably have a legal pad and a pen much likely have sitting right here and</v>

202
00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:22.730
<v Speaker 3>I'd start strumming until that felt like something and how does that make me</v>

203
00:06:22.731 --> 00:06:23.564
<v Speaker 3>feel?</v>

204
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:24.670
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>

205
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:28.040
<v Speaker 3>Keep started humming the melody maybe and hopefully somewhere in humming.</v>

206
00:06:28.041 --> 00:06:32.880
<v Speaker 3>The melody of word would pop out that are noise I would make,</v>

207
00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.820
<v Speaker 3>would turn into a word and from there you can kinda grow this thing into</v>

208
00:06:37.821 --> 00:06:39.200
<v Speaker 3>whatever it is supposed to be.</v>

209
00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:42.200
<v Speaker 3>Now that that's how I would do it if I was sitting around by myself.</v>

210
00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.860
<v Speaker 3>Now there's other times you and I could be having a conversation and you could</v>

211
00:06:45.861 --> 00:06:49.730
<v Speaker 3>say a phrase or a line or or I could read a sign going down the road.</v>

212
00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:50.691
<v Speaker 3>If you're a songwriter,</v>

213
00:06:50.691 --> 00:06:51.950
<v Speaker 3>you're always writing songs.</v>

214
00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:55.100
<v Speaker 3>It's not like a choice that you have.</v>

215
00:06:55.101 --> 00:06:55.850
<v Speaker 3>It's like a,</v>

216
00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:58.350
<v Speaker 3>an affliction that you have in some way,</v>

217
00:06:58.351 --> 00:07:03.351
<v Speaker 3>so you just kind of walking around a unconsciously things will hit you,</v>

218
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:04.131
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

219
00:07:04.131 --> 00:07:04.341
<v Speaker 3>and,</v>

220
00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:06.890
<v Speaker 3>or moments will hit you or visual.</v>

221
00:07:06.891 --> 00:07:09.470
<v Speaker 3>We're hit you and that will spark something.</v>

222
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:10.900
<v Speaker 3>So that's,</v>

223
00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:11.900
<v Speaker 3>that's really,</v>

224
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:13.343
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

225
00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:14.810
<v Speaker 3>it can come from anywhere and that's.</v>

226
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:15.980
<v Speaker 3>And that's the truth.</v>

227
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:17.780
<v Speaker 3>Here's the problem with Western medicine,</v>

228
00:07:17.781 --> 00:07:18.320
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

229
00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.730
<v Speaker 3>we're facing this.</v>

230
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:21.051
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

231
00:07:21.051 --> 00:07:23.150
<v Speaker 3>it's like a war against chronic disease.</v>

232
00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:24.590
<v Speaker 3>It's like we're being invaded by,</v>

233
00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:25.100
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

234
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.810
<v Speaker 3>remember Independence Day with all this,</v>

235
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:27.650
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

236
00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:28.550
<v Speaker 3>in doctors,</v>

237
00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:29.750
<v Speaker 3>we got bb guns.</v>

238
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:30.111
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

239
00:07:30.111 --> 00:07:31.760
<v Speaker 3>that's the stuff we are shooting at them.</v>

240
00:07:31.761 --> 00:07:33.140
<v Speaker 3>Doesn't work for chronic disease now.</v>

241
00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:33.651
<v Speaker 3>Acute stuff,</v>

242
00:07:33.651 --> 00:07:34.131
<v Speaker 3>it's different,</v>

243
00:07:34.131 --> 00:07:34.341
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

244
00:07:34.341 --> 00:07:36.680
<v Speaker 3>there's some stuff that we have this wonderful technology,</v>

245
00:07:36.681 --> 00:07:40.460
<v Speaker 3>but the road in the middle of diabetes and obesity doctors are great for fixing</v>

246
00:07:40.461 --> 00:07:41.460
<v Speaker 3>broken jaw joint.</v>

247
00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:42.290
<v Speaker 3>Broke his phone.</v>

248
00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:42.521
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

249
00:07:42.521 --> 00:07:43.540
<v Speaker 3>There's no doubt about that.</v>

250
00:07:43.590 --> 00:07:45.700
<v Speaker 3>Even even like arthritis that I sell every day,</v>

251
00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:46.641
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

252
00:07:46.641 --> 00:07:50.270
<v Speaker 3>if we were trained properly in nutrition and exercise,</v>

253
00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:50.481
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

254
00:07:50.481 --> 00:07:51.530
<v Speaker 3>that's what I've done my whole life.</v>

255
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.210
<v Speaker 3>I know what I'm doing exercise wise.</v>

256
00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.160
<v Speaker 3>But you know,</v>

257
00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:58.250
<v Speaker 3>if we were allowed to do that and instead of training all these,</v>

258
00:07:58.480 --> 00:07:59.270
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

259
00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:03.830
<v Speaker 3>radiology technicians and blood draw technicians and nursing assistance,</v>

260
00:08:03.831 --> 00:08:08.831
<v Speaker 3>if you had an army of preventive medicine people and then we train all these</v>

261
00:08:09.141 --> 00:08:10.670
<v Speaker 3>people to go into people's homes,</v>

262
00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:11.570
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

263
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:15.620
<v Speaker 3>I think Chris was talking about that and just get the crap out of their diet and</v>

264
00:08:15.621 --> 00:08:17.120
<v Speaker 3>show them how to be healthier.</v>

265
00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:17.691
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

266
00:08:17.691 --> 00:08:18.030
<v Speaker 3>You would,</v>

267
00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:18.863
<v Speaker 3>you'd save,</v>

268
00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:19.581
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

269
00:08:19.581 --> 00:08:22.120
<v Speaker 3>it's funny watching the politicians debate about healthcare,</v>

270
00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:22.820
<v Speaker 3>how to fund it,</v>

271
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:23.061
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

272
00:08:23.061 --> 00:08:27.020
<v Speaker 3>it's like you guys are arguing about the titanic as it's coming up into the</v>

273
00:08:27.021 --> 00:08:28.340
<v Speaker 3>iceberg and you're done.</v>

274
00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:30.320
<v Speaker 3>You're arguing about the color of the deck chairs.</v>

275
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:30.771
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

276
00:08:30.771 --> 00:08:34.280
<v Speaker 3>we're going over a cliff and we're not fixing it by keeping,</v>

277
00:08:34.281 --> 00:08:35.680
<v Speaker 3>putting bandaids.</v>

278
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.930
<v Speaker 3>You're not gonna write you.</v>

279
00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.980
<v Speaker 3>The technology's not going to fix diabetes.</v>

280
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:40.790
<v Speaker 3>Nutritionist,</v>

281
00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:41.070
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

282
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:44.180
<v Speaker 3>that you're essentially dealing with the problem when it's already gotten to a</v>

283
00:08:44.181 --> 00:08:45.410
<v Speaker 3>point where you're in the hospital.</v>

284
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:45.610
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

285
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:46.380
<v Speaker 3>I mean there's,</v>

286
00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:46.670
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

287
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:47.121
<v Speaker 3>like I said,</v>

288
00:08:47.121 --> 00:08:47.601
<v Speaker 3>there's a guy,</v>

289
00:08:47.601 --> 00:08:48.400
<v Speaker 3>Peter Attia,</v>

290
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:48.900
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you know,</v>

291
00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:49.250
<v Speaker 3>he is,</v>

292
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:49.881
<v Speaker 3>but he,</v>

293
00:08:49.881 --> 00:08:51.980
<v Speaker 3>he talks about when he was a surgeon,</v>

294
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:55.680
<v Speaker 3>he felt like he was at the bottom of a building and somebody is throwing off and</v>

295
00:08:55.681 --> 00:08:57.660
<v Speaker 3>his job is to catch the eggs are gone,</v>

296
00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:58.210
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

297
00:08:58.210 --> 00:08:58.651
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

298
00:08:58.651 --> 00:08:58.741
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

299
00:08:58.741 --> 00:09:00.510
<v Speaker 3>why don't we just have a guy stopped fucking thrown out?</v>

300
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:02.340
<v Speaker 3>And that's what medicine is.</v>

301
00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:03.510
<v Speaker 3>You're just catching the eggs.</v>

302
00:09:03.511 --> 00:09:04.410
<v Speaker 3>And so instead of that,</v>

303
00:09:04.411 --> 00:09:06.000
<v Speaker 3>we should be investing,</v>

304
00:09:06.001 --> 00:09:06.230
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

305
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:07.320
<v Speaker 3>all we talk about prevention,</v>

306
00:09:07.321 --> 00:09:07.951
<v Speaker 3>but it's bullshit.</v>

307
00:09:07.951 --> 00:09:09.330
<v Speaker 3>We don't do anything for prevention.</v>

308
00:09:09.331 --> 00:09:11.190
<v Speaker 3>It's so little and it'll little problem.</v>

309
00:09:11.191 --> 00:09:14.610
<v Speaker 3>The problem is a lot of it is it doesn't work the way we've designed it,</v>

310
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:15.030
<v Speaker 3>you know.</v>
