00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.320
<v Speaker 1>Hello Freak bitches on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People definitely want to fight.</v>

2
00:00:04.321 --> 00:00:07.590
<v Speaker 1>I can't live in with fight fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not either.</v>

3
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.390
<v Speaker 1>Some people think that you're supposed</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

4
00:00:09.391 --> 00:00:10.890
<v Speaker 1>That's how a relationship is supposed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>

5
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.710
<v Speaker 1>If you're not fighting the years somehow</v>
<v Speaker 1>or another,</v>

6
00:00:13.711 --> 00:00:16.500
<v Speaker 1>you don't care about each other because</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you care you get upset.</v>

7
00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.780
<v Speaker 1>So very weird sort of dynamic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The man woman relationship dynamic of</v>

8
00:00:21.781 --> 00:00:25.620
<v Speaker 1>things that people think you shouldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't expect the way people behave</v>

9
00:00:25.621 --> 00:00:29.070
<v Speaker 1>or don't behave the way they talk to you</v>
<v Speaker 1>or don't talk to you like it's very,</v>

10
00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.031
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's weird.</v>

11
00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:32.970
<v Speaker 1>It's as if it's all the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If any friendship is the same.</v>

12
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't let,</v>

13
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.810
<v Speaker 1>don't let people be mean to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't let them fucking beat you down.</v>

14
00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.040
<v Speaker 1>You'll shit at you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But some people like if you grow up in a</v>

15
00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:44.320
<v Speaker 1>home that fights all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get used to that and then you.</v>

16
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.770
<v Speaker 1>It's not a big deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like she,</v>

17
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.700
<v Speaker 1>this girl,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would she fight,</v>

18
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.850
<v Speaker 1>scream and yell at him and like as soon</v>
<v Speaker 1>as it was,</v>

19
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.560
<v Speaker 1>it was done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she'd be fine.</v>

20
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.920
<v Speaker 1>Just like say I have some coffee and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just sit there and I'd be shaking like,</v>

21
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.970
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did she say like,</v>

22
00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm not good with that kind of attention</v>
<v Speaker 1>that at all?</v>

23
00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:04.530
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I used to date this girl would get</v>

24
00:01:04.531 --> 00:01:07.470
<v Speaker 1>really mad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really mad and want to fight.</v>

25
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.880
<v Speaker 1>And then once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once there was some sort of resolution</v>

26
00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.680
<v Speaker 1>should immediately turned docile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was very odd thought she'd be</v>

27
00:01:16.681 --> 00:01:20.400
<v Speaker 1>aggressive to start some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>altercation,</v>

28
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.370
<v Speaker 1>but you could calm the altercation down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shut it down.</v>

29
00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.810
<v Speaker 1>But you had an almost shut it down by</v>
<v Speaker 1>just saying or you're not going to do</v>

30
00:01:27.811 --> 00:01:29.130
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to talk like this.</v>

31
00:01:29.131 --> 00:01:30.500
<v Speaker 1>Like this child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

32
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.580
<v Speaker 1>And I was young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I had,</v>

33
00:01:31.581 --> 00:01:36.270
<v Speaker 1>I needed to learn like how to talk to</v>
<v Speaker 1>people or how to manage situations.</v>

34
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.390
<v Speaker 1>Like sometimes like something's</v>
<v Speaker 1>happening between two people,</v>

35
00:01:39.391 --> 00:01:39.810
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

36
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.100
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're upset about something.</v>

37
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.130
<v Speaker 1>And instead of thinking about how you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>conveying your thought to them,</v>

38
00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.140
<v Speaker 1>all you think of is what you want to</v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

39
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.960
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want you to shut the fuck up.</v>

40
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.990
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though you want someone to shut the</v>

41
00:01:57.991 --> 00:02:00.840
<v Speaker 1>fuck up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is when you say that you're</v>

42
00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:04.440
<v Speaker 1>not really thinking about communicating</v>
<v Speaker 1>with them,</v>

43
00:02:04.441 --> 00:02:08.790
<v Speaker 1>like through their eyes wants anyone to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say shut the fuck up,</v>

44
00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:12.810
<v Speaker 1>but we say because we want people to</v>
<v Speaker 1>shut the fuck up and you can't deal with</v>

45
00:02:12.811 --> 00:02:13.480
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not.</v>

46
00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a point you don't want?</v>

47
00:02:16.231 --> 00:02:18.990
<v Speaker 1>You don't care what their needs are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just stop.</v>

48
00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

49
00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.880
<v Speaker 1>Well it's also like when people want</v>
<v Speaker 1>people to do things so they want people</v>

50
00:02:22.881 --> 00:02:23.714
<v Speaker 1>that are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

51
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.210
<v Speaker 1>there's the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mindset of you wanting a result.</v>

52
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.010
<v Speaker 1>You want someone to behave a certain way</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of thinking about them as like</v>

53
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.510
<v Speaker 1>your equal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can just another human being and</v>

54
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.030
<v Speaker 1>instead of thinking like I have to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>what I want.</v>

55
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Like what is it that you want?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

56
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.020
<v Speaker 1>what happened here?</v>

57
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.030
<v Speaker 1>Like why are we to pass?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I find like impasse getting older,</v>

58
00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.240
<v Speaker 1>that thing that I'm more aware of your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a big part of not thinking about</v>

59
00:02:54.601 --> 00:02:57.330
<v Speaker 1>you all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're always thinking,</v>

60
00:02:57.331 --> 00:02:59.190
<v Speaker 1>especially when you're young and you're</v>
<v Speaker 1>like coming up and you're doing.</v>

61
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.490
<v Speaker 1>It's just me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

62
00:03:00.491 --> 00:03:00.880
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

63
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.470
<v Speaker 1>because you're just trying to survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're trying to figure.</v>

64
00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:07.300
<v Speaker 1>You don't even know what you want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you shut that part down and think</v>

65
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:11.560
<v Speaker 1>about the person across from you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It opens up the whole world,</v>

66
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.250
<v Speaker 1>but it's a difficult thing to learn when</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also when you're young,</v>

67
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.990
<v Speaker 1>the camera industry just done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just tell other uses.</v>

68
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.310
<v Speaker 1>Last time you saw like a straight up</v>
<v Speaker 1>camera.</v>

69
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd have to be like a guy who was a</v>

70
00:03:23.171 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 1>photographer like Jamie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you carry those goofy bricks</v>

71
00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:29.170
<v Speaker 1>because you want to press checks and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know what he's doing.</v>

72
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.730
<v Speaker 1>It's just take a picture of the church</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>

73
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:33.200
<v Speaker 1>Just cleared the lighting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me just fix your hair.</v>

74
00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.520
<v Speaker 1>Your hair's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even that just loved that.</v>

75
00:03:36.521 --> 00:03:40.480
<v Speaker 1>They loved to pose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure she did.</v>

76
00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.710
<v Speaker 1>They go because I see them all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They just go on like little photo shoot</v>

77
00:03:44.711 --> 00:03:46.740
<v Speaker 1>dates with girls too and two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

78
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:47.181
<v Speaker 1>four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>

79
00:03:47.181 --> 00:03:49.090
<v Speaker 1>10 times and there's taking pictures of</v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

80
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.180
<v Speaker 1>They don't need to hire the photographer</v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

81
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.020
<v Speaker 1>I've seen that man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was at a restaurant in these two</v>

82
00:03:53.021 --> 00:03:55.110
<v Speaker 1>bitches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just kept doing that back and forth with</v>

83
00:03:55.111 --> 00:03:56.050
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Ready?</v>

90
00:04:04.221 --> 00:04:07.310

<v Speaker 1>neck that they only do when they're</v>

<v Speaker 1>So embarrassing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is definitely more awkward.</v>

118
00:05:20.991 --> 00:05:23.270
<v Speaker 1>Shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more awkward if your friend is</v>

119
00:05:23.271 --> 00:05:26.150
<v Speaker 1>taking and you're a guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're standing there like,</v>

120
00:05:26.151 --> 00:05:27.050

<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

124
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.550
<v Speaker 1>Like this year was okay and she kicked</v>
<v Speaker 1>you out,</v>

125

<v Speaker 1>I'm going to look mysterious.</v>

128
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:46.970
<v Speaker 1>Thinking about this book.</v>
