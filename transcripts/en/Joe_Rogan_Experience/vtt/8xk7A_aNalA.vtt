00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.810
<v Speaker 1>Drive by day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.</v>

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:04.651
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

3
00:00:04.651 --> 00:00:05.550
<v Speaker 1>so let's back up.</v>

4
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.530
<v Speaker 1>I made a note here on that Jon Jones thing.</v>

5
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.190
<v Speaker 1>Did you follow the whole Johnstones drama and the most recent one?</v>

6
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.390
<v Speaker 1>The only post drama?</v>

7
00:00:12.391 --> 00:00:12.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.060
<v Speaker 1>Was that he had a press conference the next day.</v>

9
00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:15.900
<v Speaker 1>Did,</v>

10
00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.640
<v Speaker 1>did you follow that press conference at all?</v>

11
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.410
<v Speaker 1>I saw the crying pictures.</v>

12
00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.720
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

13
00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.553
<v Speaker 1>Jamie sent them to me.</v>

14
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.300
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

15
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.740
<v Speaker 1>I went to that press conference and there was a couple of takeaways and this is</v>

16
00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:26.700
<v Speaker 1>all speculative,</v>

17
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.550
<v Speaker 1>but for this doesn't make John innocent at all.</v>

18
00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:29.881
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

19
00:00:29.881 --> 00:00:30.481
<v Speaker 1>John's guilty.</v>

20
00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:30.930
<v Speaker 1>They've got,</v>

21
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:31.691
<v Speaker 1>they've got the sample.</v>

22
00:00:31.691 --> 00:00:32.041
<v Speaker 1>It's guilty,</v>

23
00:00:32.041 --> 00:00:34.020
<v Speaker 1>but his actions were not that of a guilty man.</v>

24
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.110
<v Speaker 1>Historically guilty guys go bury their head in the sand.</v>

25
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.310
<v Speaker 1>They try to outrun this thing.</v>

26
00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:39.330
<v Speaker 1>They get with their legal teams.</v>

27
00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:40.141
<v Speaker 1>They show up at the hearing.</v>

28
00:00:40.141 --> 00:00:41.070
<v Speaker 1>They hope for the worst,</v>

29
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.090
<v Speaker 1>for the best.</v>

30
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.350
<v Speaker 1>They get the worst than they deal with it.</v>

31
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.210
<v Speaker 1>John faced the music 12 hours later he came through the hotel his whole life</v>

32
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.931
<v Speaker 1>pulling apart.</v>

33
00:00:48.931 --> 00:00:50.760
<v Speaker 1>Right now I imagine he didn't even sleep that night.</v>

34
00:00:50.761 --> 00:00:52.200
<v Speaker 1>He comes to the hotel with the fans.</v>

35
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.180
<v Speaker 1>He comes into the media PR one oh one says you read a script that was written</v>

36
00:00:57.181 --> 00:00:59.190
<v Speaker 1>for you and you exit the stage.</v>

37
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.260
<v Speaker 1>Instead he read no script.</v>

38
00:01:01.261 --> 00:01:05.070
<v Speaker 1>He took every question asked of him and that's just not what a guilty guy does.</v>

39
00:01:05.071 --> 00:01:07.810
<v Speaker 1>Not understand that he's guilty in terms of Lusaka,</v>

40
00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.830
<v Speaker 1>but what we care about his intent was he trying to get over on somebody who was</v>

41
00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:14.280
<v Speaker 1>he trying to hide something?</v>

42
00:01:14.281 --> 00:01:16.080
<v Speaker 1>His actions would represent that he did it,</v>

43
00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:17.640
<v Speaker 1>but here was the problem with the press conference.</v>

44
00:01:17.641 --> 00:01:18.474
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

45
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.800
<v Speaker 1>when you hold a press conference,</v>

46
00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.940
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>

47
00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.230
<v Speaker 1>you have one goal in mind,</v>

48
00:01:22.231 --> 00:01:25.410
<v Speaker 1>which is to win over the media and that they say nice things about you before</v>

49
00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:27.480
<v Speaker 1>you do go home and bury your head in the sand.</v>

50
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.313
<v Speaker 1>Secondly,</v>

51
00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.820
<v Speaker 1>you want to break something.</v>

52
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.430
<v Speaker 1>You want to get something out there to get ahead of the story.</v>

53
00:01:32.431 --> 00:01:34.290
<v Speaker 1>That's the whole reason you show up at these things.</v>

54
00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.090
<v Speaker 1>The only car that he had to play is what did you test positive for?</v>

55
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.350
<v Speaker 1>That was the only thing we didn't know and they refuse to reveal it so that,</v>

56
00:01:43.351 --> 00:01:46.050
<v Speaker 1>that was a little bit weird and where I was sitting,</v>

57
00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.070
<v Speaker 1>cause I've been at John Spot and here was the thing that happened with me.</v>

58
00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.960
<v Speaker 1>We're,</v>

59
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.930
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about John,</v>

60
00:01:51.931 --> 00:01:56.910
<v Speaker 1>this whole thing's going on with John based on a test that took place on June</v>

61
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.640
<v Speaker 1>16th the reason that was relevant when I went through my thing,</v>

62
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.840
<v Speaker 1>I was,</v>

63
00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.970
<v Speaker 1>he tested positive for semesters in blockers.</v>

64
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.220
<v Speaker 1>Those don't really have anything to do with anything.</v>

65
00:02:05.221 --> 00:02:05.900
<v Speaker 1>They don't help you.</v>

66
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:06.870
<v Speaker 1>They're silly.</v>

67
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.570
<v Speaker 1>I think you might've just revealed something.</v>

68
00:02:09.571 --> 00:02:10.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

69
00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.030
<v Speaker 1>he tested positive for two estrogen,</v>

70
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.920
<v Speaker 1>but you just no one else knew that.</v>

71
00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:14.521
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>

72
00:02:14.521 --> 00:02:18.180
<v Speaker 1>I'm revealing it broke personal information.</v>

73
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.380
<v Speaker 1>That's what we're doing here though.</v>

74
00:02:19.381 --> 00:02:19.680
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

75
00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.950
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

76
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:20.610
<v Speaker 1>But this is like,</v>

77
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.700
<v Speaker 1>this is like the only way that anybody could find that out is if you talked</v>

78
00:02:23.701 --> 00:02:24.534
<v Speaker 1>about it.</v>

79
00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:25.470
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>

80
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.131
<v Speaker 1>It's out there.</v>

81
00:02:26.131 --> 00:02:26.311
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

82
00:02:26.311 --> 00:02:27.240
<v Speaker 1>And that we're doing here,</v>

83
00:02:27.241 --> 00:02:28.290
<v Speaker 1>aren't we creating some news?</v>

84
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.090
<v Speaker 1>That's a big news day.</v>

85
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.721
<v Speaker 1>But listen,</v>

86
00:02:30.721 --> 00:02:31.620
<v Speaker 1>but here's the relevance.</v>

87
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.480
<v Speaker 1>And let me tie myself into this.</v>

88
00:02:33.481 --> 00:02:34.560
<v Speaker 1>When I went through this job,</v>

89
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.240
<v Speaker 1>I had something silly in there.</v>

90
00:02:36.241 --> 00:02:36.511
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

91
00:02:36.511 --> 00:02:37.440
<v Speaker 1>I had an estrogen blocker.</v>

92
00:02:37.441 --> 00:02:40.650
<v Speaker 1>I just something silly in there and everybody for gay I was,</v>

93
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.850
<v Speaker 1>I was going to be suspended,</v>

94
00:02:41.851 --> 00:02:42.684
<v Speaker 1>but fox,</v>

95
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.500
<v Speaker 1>I was fine.</v>

96
00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.370
<v Speaker 1>Everybody looked at it,</v>

97
00:02:44.371 --> 00:02:44.641
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

98
00:02:44.641 --> 00:02:46.800
<v Speaker 1>well you know we changed the rules and the Tesla and everything was fine,</v>

99
00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:47.880
<v Speaker 1>but what I had to live with,</v>

100
00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.870
<v Speaker 1>what only I knew there was another test out there,</v>

101
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.680
<v Speaker 1>but the results hadn't come back yet and I didn't know what that test was going</v>

102
00:02:55.681 --> 00:02:55.891
<v Speaker 1>to show.</v>

103
00:02:55.891 --> 00:02:57.320
<v Speaker 1>I know what it could have shown.</v>

104
00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.740
<v Speaker 1>I knew what it should have shown,</v>

105
00:02:58.741 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 1>but I what the other test could</v>

106
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.910
<v Speaker 2>have been should have as well.</v>

107
00:03:00.911 --> 00:03:03.970
<v Speaker 2>So you're sitting there hoping how good is this damn test?</v>

108
00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:05.020
<v Speaker 2>That's all you're thinking about.</v>

109
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.231
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

110
00:03:05.231 --> 00:03:05.441
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>

111
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:06.850
<v Speaker 2>you and I had a conversation.</v>

112
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.630
<v Speaker 2>You're the guy called you were on stage and I'm blowing you up.</v>

113
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:10.871
<v Speaker 2>You're like,</v>

114
00:03:10.871 --> 00:03:11.231
<v Speaker 2>hey man,</v>

115
00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:12.100
<v Speaker 2>I'm doing a show.</v>

116
00:03:12.101 --> 00:03:12.821
<v Speaker 2>Can I call you tomorrow?</v>

117
00:03:12.821 --> 00:03:13.654
<v Speaker 2>I go to night.</v>

118
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 2>I will stay at capital letters to night.</v>

119
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.650
<v Speaker 2>I need to hear from you tonight.</v>

120
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:19.930
<v Speaker 2>I remember the exact words he said,</v>

121
00:03:19.931 --> 00:03:20.350
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

122
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:20.681
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

123
00:03:20.681 --> 00:03:24.460
<v Speaker 2>we were wondering how stringent these new tests are.</v>

124
00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.010
<v Speaker 2>Turns out they're really good.</v>

125
00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.160
<v Speaker 2>Turns out it's a pretty good test.</v>

126
00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.310
<v Speaker 2>Turns out it's not like the old a one 800 requests a test that costs $99 okay?</v>

127
00:03:33.311 --> 00:03:35.920
<v Speaker 2>There's a reason this caught this test is 40 plus grand.</v>

128
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:37.683
<v Speaker 2>But the thing that I'm,</v>

129
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:38.800
<v Speaker 2>I'm wondering,</v>

130
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.110
<v Speaker 2>does John have another test out there?</v>

131
00:03:41.111 --> 00:03:42.760
<v Speaker 2>If he does it doesn't mean it's going to come back,</v>

132
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:44.980
<v Speaker 2>but that was the same spot I was in.</v>

133
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.810
<v Speaker 2>There was a shoe that could drop for me.</v>

134
00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:47.441
<v Speaker 2>It did for him.</v>

135
00:03:47.441 --> 00:03:48.400
<v Speaker 2>Is there another test out there?</v>

136
00:03:48.401 --> 00:03:49.061
<v Speaker 2>And if there's not,</v>

137
00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:50.530
<v Speaker 2>then who saw has got some explaining to do?</v>

138
00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:54.760
<v Speaker 2>If you're telling me a guy that's got a track record that tested positive for</v>

139
00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:55.140
<v Speaker 2>cocaine,</v>

140
00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.060
<v Speaker 2>going to fight in the biggest fight of his career and the last time you tested</v>

141
00:03:58.061 --> 00:03:59.470
<v Speaker 2>him was one month before the bow.</v>

142
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.420
<v Speaker 2>Then Osad has got some explaining to do,</v>

143
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:03.340
<v Speaker 2>but there's more to the story now.</v>

144
00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:04.420
<v Speaker 2>What do we hear it does?</v>

145
00:04:04.421 --> 00:04:05.710
<v Speaker 2>He passes the end up in the spot.</v>

146
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:06.341
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

147
00:04:06.341 --> 00:04:06.910
<v Speaker 2>but that's,</v>

148
00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.410
<v Speaker 2>that's the piece that's still missing.</v>

149
00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:09.070
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

150
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.680
<v Speaker 2>there's one aspect to his,</v>

151
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.980
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

152
00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.980
<v Speaker 2>test is positive tests that people are saying could possibly play a factor and</v>

153
00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:21.970
<v Speaker 2>it's a supplements that he could possibly have been taking.</v>

154
00:04:21.971 --> 00:04:23.590
<v Speaker 2>Something that like,</v>

155
00:04:23.591 --> 00:04:28.390
<v Speaker 2>this is what happened to Tim means this is what happened Yoel Romero where they</v>

156
00:04:28.391 --> 00:04:32.530
<v Speaker 2>get a supplement and it says it has a bunch of stuff on it says you look through</v>

157
00:04:32.531 --> 00:04:33.190
<v Speaker 2>the ingredients.</v>

158
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.491
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

159
00:04:33.491 --> 00:04:35.290
<v Speaker 2>creatine B12 we're good,</v>

160
00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.100
<v Speaker 2>we're good.</v>

161
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.050
<v Speaker 2>But then when you run it through a lab,</v>

162
00:04:38.051 --> 00:04:39.760
<v Speaker 2>it turns out there's a bunch of other stuff in there too.</v>

163
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.910
<v Speaker 2>And that's why it's so effective and that's why it sells.</v>

164
00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.760
<v Speaker 2>So it is possible that that could be the case.</v>

165
00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:46.810
<v Speaker 2>We don't know yet.</v>

166
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.370
<v Speaker 2>Cause then if that's the case,</v>

167
00:04:48.371 --> 00:04:52.030
<v Speaker 2>then John has to give them all the supplements that he was taking.</v>

168
00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.680
<v Speaker 2>And then they have to go to a store,</v>

169
00:04:53.681 --> 00:04:54.880
<v Speaker 2>buy them independently,</v>

170
00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:58.530
<v Speaker 2>test them and verify that these ingredients were in not just the bachelor,</v>

171
00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.373
<v Speaker 2>he hands them,</v>

172
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:00.970
<v Speaker 2>but also in other batches.</v>

173
00:05:00.971 --> 00:05:02.110
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like he doctored,</v>

174
00:05:02.111 --> 00:05:03.130
<v Speaker 2>it shows some stuff in there.</v>

175
00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.993
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

176
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.990
<v Speaker 2>But estrogen blockers are usually when people are getting off of steroids.</v>

177
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.580
<v Speaker 2>When you're coming off a cycle.</v>

178
00:05:09.581 --> 00:05:09.760
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

179
00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.630
<v Speaker 2>and it's a blocker.</v>

180
00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:10.931
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

181
00:05:10.931 --> 00:05:12.210
<v Speaker 2>men don't want estrogen anyway,</v>

182
00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:13.090
<v Speaker 2>but it's a blocker.</v>

183
00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.271
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

184
00:05:13.271 --> 00:05:13.901
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to.</v>

185
00:05:13.901 --> 00:05:15.550
<v Speaker 2>So as far as that substance goes,</v>

186
00:05:15.551 --> 00:05:16.001
<v Speaker 2>and that's all,</v>

187
00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:17.490
<v Speaker 2>that's all he's going to have to live with.</v>

188
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.530
<v Speaker 2>You're not going to explain,</v>

189
00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:19.870
<v Speaker 2>explain how they work.</v>

190
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.480
<v Speaker 2>Like for someone who doesn't understand what an estrogen blocker will do.</v>

191
00:05:22.481 --> 00:05:24.100
<v Speaker 2>If you up your testosterone,</v>

192
00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:27.250
<v Speaker 2>then your estrogen just naturally ops and guys don't want estrogen.</v>

193
00:05:27.251 --> 00:05:27.791
<v Speaker 2>So if you're a guy,</v>

194
00:05:27.791 --> 00:05:28.230
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

195
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:30.250
<v Speaker 2>you take a blocker that can block that,</v>

196
00:05:30.251 --> 00:05:30.631
<v Speaker 2>bring it to it,</v>

197
00:05:30.631 --> 00:05:31.690
<v Speaker 2>you won't get a,</v>

198
00:05:31.691 --> 00:05:33.100
<v Speaker 2>you know that the man's moves.</v>

199
00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:34.000
<v Speaker 2>Where there are you making the,</v>

200
00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm trying to think of the word guide.</v>

201
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:36.640
<v Speaker 2>Gas Stove.</v>

202
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.971
<v Speaker 2>I can't,</v>

203
00:05:36.971 --> 00:05:39.250
<v Speaker 2>even when I came from Mitch tits is all that comes to mind.</v>

204
00:05:39.251 --> 00:05:41.410
<v Speaker 2>I can't think of the word guide.</v>

205
00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:42.673
<v Speaker 2>We're closed guide.</v>

206
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:43.060
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

207
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.760
<v Speaker 2>God I know.</v>

208
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.593
<v Speaker 2>Got a mass to go.</v>

209
00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.160
<v Speaker 2>At any rate,</v>

210
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.510
<v Speaker 2>it can stop some of those things.</v>

211
00:05:46.511 --> 00:05:48.580
<v Speaker 2>So that's the speculation.</v>

212
00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:51.730
<v Speaker 2>The reason that that's on the list is they find that that's a way they can catch</v>

213
00:05:51.731 --> 00:05:52.720
<v Speaker 2>you after the fact,</v>

214
00:05:52.721 --> 00:05:52.841
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

215
00:05:52.841 --> 00:05:53.890
<v Speaker 2>if we missed you during the cycle,</v>

216
00:05:53.891 --> 00:05:54.730
<v Speaker 2>we can catch you here.</v>

217
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:55.001
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

218
00:05:55.001 --> 00:05:55.990
<v Speaker 2>it's not just that the,</v>

219
00:05:55.991 --> 00:06:00.410
<v Speaker 2>the reason why they take it after the cycle is because you get hypogonadism,</v>

220
00:06:00.411 --> 00:06:00.621
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

221
00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:00.830
<v Speaker 2>your,</v>

222
00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.830
<v Speaker 2>your body stops producing testosterone because you took exogenous testosterone.</v>

223
00:06:05.901 --> 00:06:06.290
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

224
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.880
<v Speaker 2>And so the,</v>

225
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:07.850
<v Speaker 2>to restart it,</v>

226
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:09.200
<v Speaker 2>they'd take this stuff,</v>

227
00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:10.730
<v Speaker 2>these estrogen blocker.</v>

228
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:11.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

229
00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.530
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

230
00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:11.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

231
00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:14.780
<v Speaker 1>I tested positive for an estrogen blocker and it was that exact thing.</v>

232
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:15.191
<v Speaker 1>Same thing.</v>

233
00:06:15.191 --> 00:06:16.120
<v Speaker 1>They banned testosterone.</v>

234
00:06:16.121 --> 00:06:17.590
<v Speaker 1>I went on something called Hcg.</v>

235
00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.940
<v Speaker 1>She'll return your testes back on and then you have to clomiphene,</v>

236
00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.480
<v Speaker 1>which is by definition an estrogen blocker for that same thing,</v>

237
00:06:25.481 --> 00:06:28.720
<v Speaker 1>but can also help get your body going back on testosterone.</v>

238
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.823
<v Speaker 1>So their band,</v>

239
00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:30.770
<v Speaker 1>John's got a problem.</v>

240
00:06:30.771 --> 00:06:31.181
<v Speaker 1>And again,</v>

241
00:06:31.181 --> 00:06:32.440
<v Speaker 1>this comes back to the press conference.</v>

242
00:06:32.441 --> 00:06:32.981
<v Speaker 1>He said,</v>

243
00:06:32.981 --> 00:06:37.030
<v Speaker 1>I have not taken anything new that I have not taken my entire career.</v>

244
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.100
<v Speaker 1>So somebody gave him a followup question.</v>

245
00:06:39.101 --> 00:06:41.140
<v Speaker 1>He quickly realized what he just said and he goes,</v>

246
00:06:41.141 --> 00:06:41.291
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

247
00:06:41.291 --> 00:06:41.600
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

248
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.150
<v Speaker 1>I do have a new supplement company.</v>

249
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:43.400
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

250
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.070
<v Speaker 1>I have taken some new supplements.</v>

251
00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.400
<v Speaker 1>So he realized he put himself in one point,</v>

252
00:06:47.401 --> 00:06:48.310
<v Speaker 1>you need to get out of it.</v>

253
00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.190
<v Speaker 1>The supplement company then who dropped him immediately,</v>

254
00:06:51.191 --> 00:06:51.520
<v Speaker 1>quit,</v>

255
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:52.550
<v Speaker 1>came out with a press release,</v>

256
00:06:52.551 --> 00:06:52.721
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

257
00:06:52.721 --> 00:06:54.040
<v Speaker 1>do not put this on us.</v>

258
00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:56.980
<v Speaker 1>We don't have anything to do with that and we'll turn over any samples you want.</v>

259
00:06:56.981 --> 00:06:57.241
<v Speaker 1>So that,</v>

260
00:06:57.241 --> 00:06:57.610
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

261
00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.850
<v Speaker 1>that's the downside to holding the press conference is if there's anything that</v>

262
00:07:00.851 --> 00:07:01.780
<v Speaker 1>commission hates,</v>

263
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.060
<v Speaker 1>it's when somebody isn't honest with them.</v>

264
00:07:04.061 --> 00:07:04.211
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

265
00:07:04.211 --> 00:07:07.240
<v Speaker 1>if there's anything who Sada hates and it's with Lance Armstrong found out,</v>

266
00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:11.500
<v Speaker 1>it's when you deny the scientific accuracy of their test,</v>

267
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:14.950
<v Speaker 1>that's the risk with holding a press conference.</v>

268
00:07:14.951 --> 00:07:17.590
<v Speaker 1>And that's why most legal teams will tell you,</v>

269
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:18.603
<v Speaker 1>go home,</v>

270
00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:19.331
<v Speaker 1>be quiet,</v>

271
00:07:19.331 --> 00:07:21.100
<v Speaker 1>rewrite a right to remain silent.</v>

272
00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:22.150
<v Speaker 1>Execute that.</v>

273
00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:23.290
<v Speaker 1>Show up at your hearing date,</v>

274
00:07:23.291 --> 00:07:23.951
<v Speaker 1>gets sworn in,</v>

275
00:07:23.951 --> 00:07:24.701
<v Speaker 1>say your piece,</v>

276
00:07:24.701 --> 00:07:25.810
<v Speaker 1>and then go on about your life.</v>

277
00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:30.040
<v Speaker 2>How does John not have a trusted handler?</v>

278
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:35.430
<v Speaker 2>How does John not have someone who realizes that you don't just have like a,</v>

279
00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:37.810
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

280
00:07:37.810 --> 00:07:39.430
<v Speaker 2>a high level athlete?</v>

281
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.760
<v Speaker 2>You have arguably the greatest light heavyweight of all time,</v>

282
00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:43.511
<v Speaker 2>who has not,</v>

283
00:07:43.511 --> 00:07:44.141
<v Speaker 2>in my opinion,</v>

284
00:07:44.141 --> 00:07:48.280
<v Speaker 2>reached his potential yet I think John has massive potential outside of what</v>

285
00:07:48.281 --> 00:07:51.910
<v Speaker 2>he's actually shown because when he moved to Albuquerque and we saw that he was</v>

286
00:07:51.911 --> 00:07:55.100
<v Speaker 2>training all the time and we saw the most recent footage before he fought over</v>

287
00:07:55.101 --> 00:07:57.340
<v Speaker 2>in Saint Pru where he's power lifting,</v>

288
00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:58.780
<v Speaker 2>he looks fucking huge.</v>

289
00:07:58.870 --> 00:07:59.830
<v Speaker 2>He's dedicated,</v>

290
00:07:59.831 --> 00:08:00.820
<v Speaker 2>his eating clean,</v>

291
00:08:00.821 --> 00:08:03.700
<v Speaker 2>he's making these Instagram videos of all this healthy food he's eating.</v>

292
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:06.250
<v Speaker 2>We're assuming he's getting the proper rest and all these other things.</v>

293
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:07.660
<v Speaker 2>We're assuming you'll get the wild man.</v>

294
00:08:07.661 --> 00:08:08.231
<v Speaker 2>Days are gone.</v>

295
00:08:08.231 --> 00:08:09.490
<v Speaker 2>He still got the wild man's mind,</v>

296
00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:12.910
<v Speaker 2>but now he's going to approach this like a real competitive athlete.</v>

297
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:13.990
<v Speaker 2>Here's my question to you.</v>

298
00:08:14.710 --> 00:08:18.250
<v Speaker 2>When someone is wild and talented and impulsive,</v>

299
00:08:18.251 --> 00:08:20.530
<v Speaker 2>just a wild motherfucker like Jon Jones is,</v>

300
00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.890
<v Speaker 2>is it even smart to reign that guy in Ken,</v>

301
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:24.970
<v Speaker 2>Ken,</v>

302
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:25.930
<v Speaker 2>it affect him.</v>

303
00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:26.471
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

304
00:08:26.471 --> 00:08:31.471
<v Speaker 2>is it a positive thing to reign him in or is part of what he is and why he's so</v>

305
00:08:32.381 --> 00:08:37.090
<v Speaker 2>good and why he's willing to open with a flying knee on a shogun?</v>

306
00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.950
<v Speaker 2>The their their first fight,</v>

307
00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:40.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean the first fight for a title it,</v>

308
00:08:41.050 --> 00:08:41.411
<v Speaker 2>what was He,</v>

309
00:08:41.411 --> 00:08:46.060
<v Speaker 2>2123 or 20 he opens up with a flying knee on,</v>

310
00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:46.570
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

311
00:08:46.570 --> 00:08:48.130
<v Speaker 2>one of the legends of MMA,</v>

312
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:53.220
<v Speaker 2>former pride champion or fry pride up Grand Prix tramp champion and UFC champion</v>

313
00:08:53.681 --> 00:08:54.220
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

314
00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:54.491
<v Speaker 2>You will,</v>

315
00:08:54.491 --> 00:08:56.920
<v Speaker 2>you look at a like John and the,</v>

316
00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.370
<v Speaker 2>the way he competes in the way he's,</v>

317
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.850
<v Speaker 2>he's so creative and wild in there and impulsive.</v>

318
00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.730
<v Speaker 2>It's almost like that's a part of his success.</v>

319
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:09.630
<v Speaker 2>I fully agree and historically I could bring up athletes where that is true or</v>

320
00:09:09.631 --> 00:09:12.240
<v Speaker 2>they go sober where they go straight in there when they find God,</v>

321
00:09:12.241 --> 00:09:16.860
<v Speaker 2>whatever these things are and they change something that yeah,</v>

322
00:09:16.861 --> 00:09:18.150
<v Speaker 2>the dominoes start to fall.</v>

323
00:09:18.151 --> 00:09:20.550
<v Speaker 2>The problem is when you've got a wild man like John,</v>

324
00:09:21.390 --> 00:09:24.510
<v Speaker 2>he's in a box and it's a loose box and he's having some fights,</v>

325
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:27.090
<v Speaker 2>but usually that continues to escalate.</v>

326
00:09:27.091 --> 00:09:29.790
<v Speaker 2>So he kinda needs to keep himself right in that framework.</v>

327
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:32.730
<v Speaker 2>And the bad news is it usually just keeps getting,</v>

328
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:34.500
<v Speaker 2>it just usually just keeps pushing.</v>

329
00:09:34.501 --> 00:09:35.580
<v Speaker 2>So that's a very important,</v>

330
00:09:35.581 --> 00:09:36.540
<v Speaker 2>that becomes a problem.</v>

331
00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.600
<v Speaker 2>That's a very important point where people escalate things like billionaires</v>

332
00:09:39.601 --> 00:09:40.650
<v Speaker 2>want more billions,</v>

333
00:09:40.651 --> 00:09:40.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

334
00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.060
<v Speaker 2>They want islands now.</v>

335
00:09:42.061 --> 00:09:44.310
<v Speaker 2>They want fucking jets and spaceships and,</v>

336
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:49.410
<v Speaker 2>and with a pro athlete or a wild person is doing crazy shit.</v>

337
00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.000
<v Speaker 2>They want to do more crazy shit.</v>

338
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:52.880
<v Speaker 2>They want to drive 150 miles an hour.</v>

339
00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:53.190
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

340
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.360
<v Speaker 2>They want to Ah,</v>

341
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:55.771
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

342
00:09:55.771 --> 00:09:57.840
<v Speaker 2>but it just seems like whatever the fuck you do,</v>

343
00:09:57.850 --> 00:09:58.210
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

344
00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:00.270
<v Speaker 2>just nerf everything around him,</v>

345
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:00.810
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

346
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:01.320
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

347
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:02.460
<v Speaker 2>By up to town.</v>

348
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:05.010
<v Speaker 2>Fucking have three guys that he trusts.</v>

349
00:10:05.011 --> 00:10:08.340
<v Speaker 2>Follow him around everywhere and make sure that he doesn't eat anything that</v>

350
00:10:08.341 --> 00:10:08.981
<v Speaker 2>he's not supposed to eat.</v>

351
00:10:08.981 --> 00:10:09.360
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

352
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.980
<v Speaker 2>Don't take any pills you're not supposed to take.</v>

353
00:10:10.981 --> 00:10:11.814
<v Speaker 2>Don't,</v>

354
00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.110
<v Speaker 2>most of us don't drive.</v>

355
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:13.501
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

356
00:10:13.501 --> 00:10:16.710
<v Speaker 2>that was his biggest problem was getting behind the wheel in front of everything</v>

357
00:10:16.711 --> 00:10:17.341
<v Speaker 2>else he was doing.</v>

358
00:10:17.341 --> 00:10:17.961
<v Speaker 2>It's like John Jay,</v>

359
00:10:17.961 --> 00:10:18.600
<v Speaker 2>you got to get,</v>

360
00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.540
<v Speaker 2>you got to get a show for it.</v>

361
00:10:19.541 --> 00:10:20.191
<v Speaker 2>You've got to get Uber,</v>

362
00:10:20.191 --> 00:10:21.090
<v Speaker 2>you got to take a taxi,</v>

363
00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:22.470
<v Speaker 2>don't get behind the wheel.</v>

364
00:10:22.471 --> 00:10:24.210
<v Speaker 2>That was the most of his problems.</v>

365
00:10:24.211 --> 00:10:25.021
<v Speaker 2>He had some other ones,</v>

366
00:10:25.021 --> 00:10:26.160
<v Speaker 2>but that was the most of it.</v>

367
00:10:26.161 --> 00:10:28.380
<v Speaker 2>If you just took him out of the driver's seat,</v>

368
00:10:28.770 --> 00:10:30.120
<v Speaker 2>a lot of this doesn't exist.</v>

369
00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:30.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

370
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.590
<v Speaker 2>A lot of it doesn't exist.</v>

371
00:10:31.591 --> 00:10:34.560
<v Speaker 2>But this most recent one obviously it does and the most like,</v>

372
00:10:34.561 --> 00:10:34.801
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

373
00:10:34.801 --> 00:10:35.460
<v Speaker 2>he had those,</v>

374
00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.710
<v Speaker 2>the co two major car accidents,</v>

375
00:10:37.711 --> 00:10:40.740
<v Speaker 2>we had that beautiful Bentley and slid it into a tree.</v>

376
00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:41.603
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

377
00:10:41.700 --> 00:10:42.181
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

378
00:10:42.181 --> 00:10:42.401
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

379
00:10:42.401 --> 00:10:45.540
<v Speaker 2>obviously the one where you crashing that woman and left the scene of the crime,</v>

380
00:10:45.541 --> 00:10:46.560
<v Speaker 2>which was horrendous.</v>

381
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:48.510
<v Speaker 2>He survived that though.</v>

382
00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:49.111
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

383
00:10:49.111 --> 00:10:49.771
<v Speaker 2>he survived that.</v>

384
00:10:49.771 --> 00:10:50.540
<v Speaker 2>He came back and the,</v>

385
00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:52.050
<v Speaker 2>and Saint [inaudible] he won,</v>

386
00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:57.090
<v Speaker 2>he beat a top six guy on short notice and then this happens and two is he get</v>

387
00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:03.290
<v Speaker 2>positive and something that as a is small and innocuous as estrogen blockers.</v>

388
00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:04.621
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

389
00:11:04.621 --> 00:11:05.101
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

390
00:11:05.101 --> 00:11:07.140
<v Speaker 2>So you go back to that open state proof fight.</v>

391
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:10.620
<v Speaker 2>Single worst performance is a performance of John's career.</v>

392
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:13.080
<v Speaker 2>Single worst by light years.</v>

393
00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:14.640
<v Speaker 2>And then you break it down a little further.</v>

394
00:11:14.641 --> 00:11:17.130
<v Speaker 2>He won the grapple and he won the strike and he won every round.</v>

395
00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:17.640
<v Speaker 2>He didn't,</v>

396
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:18.720
<v Speaker 2>he didn't back off.</v>

397
00:11:18.721 --> 00:11:19.560
<v Speaker 2>You didn't get tired.</v>

398
00:11:19.561 --> 00:11:20.430
<v Speaker 2>He was stronger.</v>

399
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:21.990
<v Speaker 2>And that was on a bad day.</v>

400
00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:23.520
<v Speaker 2>I didn't think it was a bad fight.</v>

401
00:11:23.550 --> 00:11:23.731
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

402
00:11:23.731 --> 00:11:24.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

403
00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:25.710
<v Speaker 2>everyone says the single worst performance.</v>

404
00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:31.040
<v Speaker 2>I have a great deal of respect for open St Pru and I think [inaudible] is a very</v>

405
00:11:31.921 --> 00:11:32.880
<v Speaker 2>dangerous guy.</v>

406
00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:34.440
<v Speaker 2>He's very explosive.</v>

407
00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.020
<v Speaker 2>His left power kick is extremely strong.</v>

408
00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:38.490
<v Speaker 2>He has a nasty left hook.</v>

409
00:11:38.491 --> 00:11:40.890
<v Speaker 2>He's a southpaw and he fights odd.</v>

410
00:11:40.891 --> 00:11:42.450
<v Speaker 2>He has a very odd style.</v>

411
00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:44.460
<v Speaker 2>I would agree about elephants.</v>

412
00:11:44.461 --> 00:11:47.370
<v Speaker 2>I think your assessment there is fair and I think his stock went up that night,</v>

413
00:11:47.371 --> 00:11:48.240
<v Speaker 2>but when I'm watching John,</v>

414
00:11:48.241 --> 00:11:48.511
<v Speaker 2>I'm going,</v>

415
00:11:48.511 --> 00:11:48.751
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

416
00:11:48.751 --> 00:11:49.430
<v Speaker 2>this isn't that.</v>

417
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:50.610
<v Speaker 2>This is a rusty John.</v>

418
00:11:50.611 --> 00:11:51.391
<v Speaker 2>This is slower.</v>

419
00:11:51.391 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 2>The outputs a little bit down the bottom line</v>

420
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:54.940
<v Speaker 1>is on a bad day,</v>

421
00:11:54.941 --> 00:11:56.680
<v Speaker 1>he left with a world championship on a bed.</v>

422
00:11:56.681 --> 00:11:57.520
<v Speaker 1>That's how good he is.</v>

423
00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.290
<v Speaker 1>The other side of John,</v>

424
00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:02.140
<v Speaker 1>you know when you're talking about the car wrecks or one more time about the</v>

425
00:12:02.141 --> 00:12:03.430
<v Speaker 1>cocaine or what he's going through now,</v>

426
00:12:03.431 --> 00:12:03.821
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

427
00:12:03.821 --> 00:12:05.410
<v Speaker 1>this was my takeaway from the press conference.</v>

428
00:12:05.890 --> 00:12:10.060
<v Speaker 1>The biggest takeaway was John won't own anything and it's like John,</v>

429
00:12:10.061 --> 00:12:13.000
<v Speaker 1>at some point you can't do the routine about,</v>

430
00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why God put me in this spot.</v>

431
00:12:14.981 --> 00:12:15.814
<v Speaker 1>This is a bit,</v>

432
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:17.230
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why God put me in the spot.</v>

433
00:12:17.231 --> 00:12:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Everything happens for a reason.</v>

434
00:12:18.521 --> 00:12:19.720
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to come out better on the other side,</v>

435
00:12:19.721 --> 00:12:20.554
<v Speaker 1>it's like John,</v>

436
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:24.280
<v Speaker 1>you're acting like you got diagnosed with diabetes or cancer or something,</v>

437
00:12:24.281 --> 00:12:25.270
<v Speaker 1>you know and that you're the victim.</v>

438
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:26.560
<v Speaker 1>You were in a hit and run.</v>

439
00:12:26.561 --> 00:12:27.371
<v Speaker 1>You did the hidden,</v>

440
00:12:27.371 --> 00:12:28.180
<v Speaker 1>and you did the running.</v>

441
00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:29.013
<v Speaker 1>That was your fault.</v>

442
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:30.160
<v Speaker 1>On the cocaine thing.</v>

443
00:12:30.161 --> 00:12:30.641
<v Speaker 1>You didn't say,</v>

444
00:12:30.641 --> 00:12:31.750
<v Speaker 1>somebody slipped me a Mickey.</v>

445
00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:31.991
<v Speaker 1>You said,</v>

446
00:12:31.991 --> 00:12:32.920
<v Speaker 1>I was at a party in Brazil.</v>

447
00:12:32.921 --> 00:12:34.410
<v Speaker 1>I rolled up a hundred and went down to the table.</v>

448
00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.273
<v Speaker 1>That was your fault.</v>

449
00:12:35.770 --> 00:12:40.000
<v Speaker 1>Now you're in a jam here for two banned substances and you're still not taking</v>

450
00:12:40.001 --> 00:12:41.890
<v Speaker 1>respond and you think God's put you in this spot.</v>

451
00:12:41.891 --> 00:12:42.430
<v Speaker 1>It's like John said,</v>

452
00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:45.130
<v Speaker 1>you put yourself in this spot and at some point if you're the baddest dude in</v>

453
00:12:45.131 --> 00:12:46.000
<v Speaker 1>the world and you are,</v>

454
00:12:46.330 --> 00:12:48.010
<v Speaker 1>you got to man up on these things.</v>

455
00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.000
<v Speaker 1>You got to man up and go,</v>

456
00:12:49.001 --> 00:12:49.151
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

457
00:12:49.151 --> 00:12:51.100
<v Speaker 1>I'm guilty and I how exactly it happened.</v>

458
00:12:51.101 --> 00:12:51.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

459
00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:52.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try to figure that out,</v>

460
00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:55.000
<v Speaker 1>but I'm definitely guilty who Sada does a good job.</v>

461
00:12:55.001 --> 00:12:55.870
<v Speaker 1>I trust those labs.</v>

462
00:12:55.871 --> 00:12:56.710
<v Speaker 1>Let's get to the bottom of it.</v>

463
00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:58.680
<v Speaker 2>Jail son in public relations.</v>

464
00:12:58.681 --> 00:12:59.191
<v Speaker 2>This is what we need.</v>

465
00:12:59.191 --> 00:13:01.260
<v Speaker 2>We need to here need a little earpiece.</v>

466
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:02.820
<v Speaker 2>You put in John Jones ear.</v>

467
00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:04.290
<v Speaker 2>You sit behind the screens,</v>

468
00:13:04.291 --> 00:13:05.124
<v Speaker 2>you have a monitor.</v>

469
00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:05.730
<v Speaker 1>You Go,</v>

470
00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:05.911
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

471
00:13:05.911 --> 00:13:06.021
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

472
00:13:06.021 --> 00:13:06.201
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

473
00:13:06.201 --> 00:13:06.351
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

474
00:13:06.351 --> 00:13:06.561
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

475
00:13:06.561 --> 00:13:06.920
<v Speaker 1>John.</v>

476
00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.540
<v Speaker 1>This is not just stop.</v>

477
00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:09.770
<v Speaker 1>Stop right there,</v>

478
00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.630
<v Speaker 1>but no more victim no more.</v>

479
00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:12.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

480
00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:15.050
<v Speaker 2>you stand up like Tony Montana and that fucking restaurant.</v>

481
00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.380
<v Speaker 2>You're looking at the back guy there to say hello there it is.</v>

482
00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.120
<v Speaker 2>Low through the bad guy.</v>

483
00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:20.871
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

484
00:13:20.871 --> 00:13:21.651
<v Speaker 2>I liked to party.</v>

485
00:13:21.651 --> 00:13:22.160
<v Speaker 2>Bitch,</v>

486
00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:22.821
<v Speaker 2>I fucked up.</v>

487
00:13:22.821 --> 00:13:23.654
<v Speaker 2>I took some shit.</v>

488
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:24.140
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

489
00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:24.331
<v Speaker 2>what,</v>

490
00:13:24.331 --> 00:13:29.331
<v Speaker 2>so what supplements would have testosterone blockers or estrogen blockers,</v>

491
00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:32.790
<v Speaker 1>excuse none that I've ever heard of and again,</v>

492
00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:34.253
<v Speaker 2>but,</v>

493
00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:36.170
<v Speaker 2>but if they boost testosterone,</v>

494
00:13:36.530 --> 00:13:37.610
<v Speaker 2>estrogen blockers,</v>

495
00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:40.860
<v Speaker 2>apparently the is more of an effective test off.</v>

496
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:41.850
<v Speaker 1>How's it work?</v>

497
00:13:41.850 --> 00:13:42.120
<v Speaker 1>I'm not,</v>

498
00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:43.070
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard that.</v>

499
00:13:43.071 --> 00:13:43.990
<v Speaker 1>And that could be true.</v>

500
00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:47.830
<v Speaker 1>I think of myself as kind of an expert in this field from being on the wrong</v>

501
00:13:47.831 --> 00:13:48.131
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>

502
00:13:48.131 --> 00:13:48.521
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>

503
00:13:48.521 --> 00:13:49.450
<v Speaker 1>being on both sides of it.</v>

504
00:13:49.451 --> 00:13:50.340
<v Speaker 1>But uh,</v>

505
00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:51.820
<v Speaker 1>I've never heard of that.</v>

506
00:13:51.821 --> 00:13:53.650
<v Speaker 1>I can't imagine why I supplement company would do that.</v>

507
00:13:53.651 --> 00:13:57.280
<v Speaker 1>And this supplement company wasn't like Tim Means his company or Eol Ramirez,</v>

508
00:13:57.281 --> 00:13:59.470
<v Speaker 1>they came out with a press release instantly.</v>

509
00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:01.090
<v Speaker 1>So do not put this on us.</v>

510
00:14:01.091 --> 00:14:02.680
<v Speaker 1>Let us know what you need from us.</v>

511
00:14:02.681 --> 00:14:04.330
<v Speaker 1>We'll drop it off at the lab ourselves.</v>

512
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:05.041
<v Speaker 2>Jamie,</v>

513
00:14:05.041 --> 00:14:06.780
<v Speaker 2>see if you find this online,</v>

514
00:14:06.781 --> 00:14:10.050
<v Speaker 2>because someone told me about it this weekend and I never got a chance to look</v>

515
00:14:10.051 --> 00:14:10.410
<v Speaker 2>at.</v>

516
00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:15.410
<v Speaker 2>Someone said that there are certain things in supplements that you know,</v>

517
00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:20.690
<v Speaker 2>could have been sold by a company that would allow you to test positive for</v>

518
00:14:21.121 --> 00:14:22.110
<v Speaker 2>these very things.</v>

519
00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:23.260
<v Speaker 2>See if,</v>

520
00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:24.380
<v Speaker 2>see if you can find that in,</v>

521
00:14:24.381 --> 00:14:26.970
<v Speaker 2>in relationship to John Jones is test.</v>

522
00:14:26.971 --> 00:14:28.800
<v Speaker 2>Cause I remember someone talking about it and I said,</v>

523
00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.210
<v Speaker 2>I got to remember to look this up.</v>

524
00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.320
<v Speaker 2>It's only there only those two chemicals.</v>

525
00:14:34.321 --> 00:14:37.350
<v Speaker 2>The only exist like in a pharmaceutical world,</v>

526
00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:37.680
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

527
00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:37.831
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

528
00:14:37.831 --> 00:14:38.550
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

529
00:14:38.550 --> 00:14:40.500
<v Speaker 2>So it's not like it's a root or something.</v>

530
00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.210
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

531
00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:41.680
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

532
00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:42.080
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

533
00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:44.900
<v Speaker 1>And then what exactly they got him for me that that's still coming out.</v>

534
00:14:44.901 --> 00:14:45.800
<v Speaker 1>But that was one of the things,</v>

535
00:14:45.801 --> 00:14:47.930
<v Speaker 1>again to go back to the press conference and I think,</v>

536
00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:49.730
<v Speaker 1>I think John did more good than he did bay.</v>

537
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:51.530
<v Speaker 1>I think it was kind of a good thing that came out.</v>

538
00:14:51.531 --> 00:14:52.131
<v Speaker 1>He show courage.</v>

539
00:14:52.131 --> 00:14:52.851
<v Speaker 1>He didn't read the script,</v>

540
00:14:52.851 --> 00:14:53.750
<v Speaker 1>he answered all the questions.</v>

541
00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.240
<v Speaker 1>But the bad was he didn't tell us what he tested positive for.</v>

542
00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:57.720
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

543
00:14:57.720 --> 00:14:58.760
<v Speaker 1>And the bad news.</v>

544
00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:00.050
<v Speaker 1>Now he's stuck with speculation.</v>

545
00:15:00.051 --> 00:15:01.790
<v Speaker 1>If he were to come out and tell us exactly what it was,</v>

546
00:15:01.791 --> 00:15:04.870
<v Speaker 1>you and I won't have to gas and go to the Internet and Spec and speculation and</v>

547
00:15:04.871 --> 00:15:06.680
<v Speaker 1>rumors is which what you don't need.</v>

548
00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:07.100
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

549
00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.980
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why he held that with understanding.</v>

550
00:15:09.990 --> 00:15:12.860
<v Speaker 1>Osada is going to tell us if you don't tell us who Sada,</v>

551
00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:13.753
<v Speaker 1>I don't think they know.</v>

552
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:14.010
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

553
00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:14.251
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

554
00:15:14.251 --> 00:15:14.601
<v Speaker 1>I really,</v>

555
00:15:14.601 --> 00:15:17.510
<v Speaker 1>I think if they're going to charge him and they getting sued,</v>

556
00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:18.410
<v Speaker 1>we have,</v>

557
00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:20.540
<v Speaker 1>they're going to charge him and they are within the event.</v>

558
00:15:20.570 --> 00:15:20.781
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

559
00:15:20.781 --> 00:15:22.850
<v Speaker 1>that I'm going for for breaking only one year.</v>

560
00:15:22.851 --> 00:15:23.730
<v Speaker 1>Like y'all take it,</v>

561
00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:24.321
<v Speaker 1>go information,</v>

562
00:15:24.321 --> 00:15:25.154
<v Speaker 1>you'll take it.</v>

563
00:15:25.250 --> 00:15:25.491
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

564
00:15:25.491 --> 00:15:26.810
<v Speaker 1>not if it's medical information.</v>

565
00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.160
<v Speaker 1>I suppose you're right with Hipaa,</v>

566
00:15:28.161 --> 00:15:30.080
<v Speaker 1>but this doesn't fall under that.</v>

567
00:15:30.110 --> 00:15:33.590
<v Speaker 1>The commission is going to bring charges against him for certain supplements are</v>

568
00:15:33.591 --> 00:15:34.251
<v Speaker 1>going to bring him in,</v>

569
00:15:34.251 --> 00:15:35.390
<v Speaker 1>require that he's there.</v>

570
00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.190
<v Speaker 1>They're going to have to address it.</v>

571
00:15:37.191 --> 00:15:38.240
<v Speaker 1>Then he's going to say his piece,</v>

572
00:15:38.241 --> 00:15:38.391
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

573
00:15:38.391 --> 00:15:38.841
<v Speaker 1>I took this.</v>

574
00:15:38.841 --> 00:15:41.090
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think I'd get caught or I don't know anything about it.</v>

575
00:15:41.091 --> 00:15:41.351
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>

576
00:15:41.351 --> 00:15:42.860
<v Speaker 1>that's a route guys go as well,</v>

577
00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.690
<v Speaker 1>but the bottom line is it's going to come out.</v>

578
00:15:44.691 --> 00:15:49.010
<v Speaker 1>I thought he had a good opportunity to tell us what it was and perhaps give a</v>

579
00:15:49.011 --> 00:15:51.980
<v Speaker 1>guess as to how it got an assist him if he's going to take that path.</v>

580
00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:53.300
<v Speaker 1>The outright denial path,</v>

581
00:15:53.301 --> 00:15:55.130
<v Speaker 1>that's not a great one historically,</v>

582
00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:58.910
<v Speaker 1>but some guys take it if that's the route he's going to go down outright denial.</v>

583
00:15:59.510 --> 00:16:00.343
<v Speaker 1>Tell us what it is.</v>

584
00:16:07.060 --> 00:16:07.893
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

585
00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:10.400
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
