Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:06.321 --> 00:00:08.870
the Joe Rogan experience podcast brought to you by the flashlight.

3
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.490
If you go to Joe rogan.net and click on the link that says fleshlight and during

4
00:00:13.491 --> 00:00:17.150
the code name Brogan,
you get 15% off.
All right,

5
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.460
and would that said Taka love bitches?

6
00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.143
<v 0>Okay.</v>

7
00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:26.150
<v 2>The Joe Rogan experience</v>

8
00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:33.090
<v 0>[inaudible]</v>

9
00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.960
[inaudible].

10
00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.980
<v 2>That black guy voice makes me uncomfortable,
dude.
I want to be honest with you.</v>

11
00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.050
There's a sound really a black guy voice.

12
00:00:59.051 --> 00:01:01.960
It's a white guy talking like a black guy,
which has never cool,

13
00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.980
which is not even right.

14
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.130
It's actually a robot that's been programmed to be a black guy,

15
00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.590
holds a robot that's white made by white people.

16
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.230
They don't know how to do a black voice.
I liked Keira Knightley better.

17
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.140
Keira Knightley was better.
That was so hot.
There's something about,
uh,
someone,

18
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.250
a black guy faking a white voice is really completely acceptable to the best

19
00:01:21.161 --> 00:01:23.200
black voice.
Yeah,
Gold Dude.
What does it,

20
00:01:23.201 --> 00:01:25.570
does it weird you out though when you can call somebody on the phone,

21
00:01:25.571 --> 00:01:28.480
you know that they're black when you're talking to them?
I like.

22
00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.880
How would I describe this to an alien?
You know,

23
00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.200
how would I describe how I saw this as a black guy,
but I know it's a black guy.

24
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.620
I miss that laugh.

25
00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.070
Laugh brought to you by Bert pricer.

26
00:01:42.071 --> 00:01:46.150
Ladies and Gentlemen Follow Bert on Twitter from K,

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.300

which just started,

29
00:01:52.301 --> 00:01:56.070
right?
Yup.
Last week was our first episode.
First week powerful.
Yeah,

30
00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.100
and it was a raging success.
Great Ratings and Greg Social Media Success,

31
00:02:00.101 --> 00:02:03.760
social media successors is a brand new thing they track on trend TV or TV.

32
00:02:03.761 --> 00:02:08.200
Trenders and my agent sent it to me.
He's like you calling card and I was like,

33
00:02:08.201 --> 00:02:11.020
I did and he was like,
you were number nine right behind the Kardashians.

34
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.650
Well right behind the fucking night.
It's just me.
It's me.
I literally,

35
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.530
here's my theory about promotion on Twitter.

36
00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.160
I think you have to promote with a joke and that's my rule.

37
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.370
If you obsessive Li like,
like,
like I told you the other day,
Ralph,

38
00:02:25.371 --> 00:02:28.330
he is just taking Twitter to a brand new level.
Thank you Brian.

39
00:02:28.331 --> 00:02:30.090
Joe Hasn't seen any of it.
I'm like,

40
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.030
have you dodged that bullet coming out of Iraqi go?
They've been bombing in here.

41
00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.190
I'm like,
it is like a wet Ralphie may is up to you.

42
00:02:36.191 --> 00:02:38.560
I guarantee you he tweeted last two minutes,
I guarantee.
Yeah,

43
00:02:38.561 --> 00:02:42.340
I just added them in and already he's been Kevin Smith and me.
Yeah,

44
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.570
but people who don't know is it Ralphie underscore may,
uh,

45
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.670
I don't know if it's him in that big orange jacket.
Yeah.
Ralph,

46
00:02:51.671 --> 00:02:54.640
you underscore May.
It's um,
whoa.
Jesus Christ.

47
00:02:54.641 --> 00:02:59.050
He's been on Twitter for how long?
Like a week?
Literally.

48
00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.913
Literally a week.

49
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.920
Maybe a week and a half and an and he had like 15 tweets or like 20 tweets up

50
00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.900
until then.
And I'm sure there's a thousand now.
How many total clinic?

51
00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.680
The tweets he has because for some reason my,

52
00:03:10.681 --> 00:03:13.270
my computer has gone back to the old Twitter.

53
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.720
You know I was using the new Twitter,
you know the,
the new Twitter science.

54
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.410
I don't know how to,
how to switch it up and had that very top.
Does it?

55
00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.980
Is it [inaudible] underscore?
May Ralphie underscore Matt here.

56
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:25.510
I'll just go into my trend and I'll find them right away.

57
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:26.890
I don't know what happened.
All right.

58
00:03:26.891 --> 00:03:30.850
He's got a total of what that can't be right.

59
00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.560
He just started using it 1082 tweets.
It has all been using it a couple of weeks.

60
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.220
That's true.
True.
Yeah,
that's true.

61
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.030
Unless he's got some kind of
defense and Ralphie's defense,

62
00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.860
he's not promoting anything.
He simply arguing.

63
00:03:47.861 --> 00:03:51.040
He hasn't learned not to argue with people yet,
so he's,

64
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.310
he's just going back and forth and you really have to learn.

65
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.170
You have to learn that shit.
Yeah.
I just,

66
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.390
I never replied to anyone at all and I promote,
I only promote with a joke,

67
00:04:01.391 --> 00:04:05.530
so if I'm going to promote the show,
I'll do something funny to promote it.

68
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:09.810
I think those get retweeted.
I try to be.
I don't,

69
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.580
not always funny if I find some interesting shit,

70
00:04:12.581 --> 00:04:15.180
I just throw up some interesting shit.
Anything,
uh,

71
00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.290
anything that I think is fascinating,
whether it's funny or not.

72
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.900
And if I have to promote something,
I promote something.

73
00:04:19.901 --> 00:04:23.450
But I always tried to treat it as if I,
I'm always,

74
00:04:23.451 --> 00:04:27.280
I'm aware of people's attention spans and anything interesting that I find I

75
00:04:27.281 --> 00:04:30.730
give to Twitter and immediately I'll give it right back over your different

76
00:04:30.731 --> 00:04:33.730
animal than say myself or Brian who,
if we should promote that,

77
00:04:33.731 --> 00:04:37.330
people will just delete us and be like enough of that shit.
Shit.

78
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.610
They don't want to see our shit and
the guy,

79
00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.920
where's the guy at that orgy fingering asshole?
You know,
I went to,

80
00:04:44.921 --> 00:04:48.880
everyone came to fuck where the guys just pay pal,
even grosser.

81
00:04:48.881 --> 00:04:50.110
I went to this one guy's Twitter.

82
00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.110
I don't want to mention his name because I don't particularly like him,
but it's,

83
00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:55.930
um,
it was all promoting some,

84
00:04:55.931 --> 00:05:00.931
a special that's coming out and it was all like him tweeting celebrities using

85
00:05:01.751 --> 00:05:06.700
the exact same worrying,
just having a different celebrities name,
hey blank.
Hey,

86
00:05:06.701 --> 00:05:11.020
you know whoever Kim Kardashian,
Halacha boy and my specials coming out,
blah,

87
00:05:11.021 --> 00:05:14.740
blah,
blah.
And it was his whole Twitter.
Was that,
is he an official Twitter?

88
00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:17.440
Like a verified account.
Wow.

89
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.410
That's somebody that's somebody I wonder if that's even almost like an assistant

90
00:05:20.411 --> 00:05:22.210
that's like,
no,
you're supposed to be,
could be.

91
00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:24.610
It could be that or it could be just someone who's a,

92
00:05:24.611 --> 00:05:28.290
doesn't know how to use social media and is an annoying cunt.
What's his name?

93
00:05:28.291 --> 00:05:30.180
Ryan Wilson on,
we'll talk later.
Huh?

94
00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.080
I tweeted the game on Sunday hour before my show started the game,
the rapper.

95
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:37.750
I was like,
Yo,
the game you in La.
I'm having a barbecue at my house.

96
00:05:37.751 --> 00:05:41.800
Bring over some potato salad.
But I was just like,
if he does reply,

97
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.430
you've got a problem.
It's all my shit son.
Here's what I used to do.
Okay.
Ready?

98
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.050
This was the,
my favorite thing to do.

99
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.440
I used to go on to black centric 10 trend topics.
Okay.

100
00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:53.670
Black Century trending topic is,
it's going to something,

101
00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.220
there's going to be one that reads black,
like,
uh,
like,
um,
like

102
00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:03.110
<v 3>mine was day gifts for the hood,
Valentine's Day,
gifts for the hood.</v>

103
00:06:03.111 --> 00:06:07.040
And so I thought it would be funny if in the end,
you know,
it's all like very,

104
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.560
it's black people being racist about black people.
It's just them writing like,

105
00:06:09.561 --> 00:06:12.920
um,
get her a click clack,
you know,
she needs a gun in the hood,

106
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:15.310
get her another babies,
you know,
she's already got 10 yards.

107
00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.980
How about child support son?
And so then I,
I wrote back,

108
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.593
I wrote back,

109
00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:25.330
how about anything dungeons and dragons son and no one got it right?
No one,

110
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.740
no one laughed at all.
And they started getting mad.
Like,

111
00:06:27.741 --> 00:06:31.010
what are you doing in here man?
Get out white boy.
And then I was like,

112
00:06:31.011 --> 00:06:35.030
give me nothing.
They said,
get out without white boy.
This is for the hood.

113
00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.990
Don't you read the trend topic?
And I'm all right,
how about a classy pen?

114
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.520
And they're like,
oh no,
I see pen,
like what the fuck?
And then I was like,

115
00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.360
all right,
all right.
All right,
one more chance.
How about a bottle of champagne?

116
00:06:47.361 --> 00:06:49.130
But you spraying all over like a Ho and they're like,

117
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.810
that's more like it does dancer,
Girl.
I got tons to grow on them.

118
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.990
And so girls started I and I started doing them and it was like,

119
00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:59.920
I forget the woman we,
I know it saved in my phone,
but like I said,

120
00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:02.760
girl on them and I was just,
I was like,
don't write anything racist.
Just right.

121
00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.260
Very good suggestions that you would think like one was things black people

122
00:07:06.261 --> 00:07:07.610
scared of.
And then,

123
00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.050
<v 1>and this is a,
this,
so this is a trending topic.</v>

124
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.930
How do you start a trending topic?
If you want any topic is pound sign.

125
00:07:12.931 --> 00:07:15.270
And then one word,
I'll tell you what he's been like,
whatever it is.

126
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:16.970
One word all in one word,
right?

127
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.860
Like what are black people scared of would be no spaces.

128
00:07:19.861 --> 00:07:22.200
All one Charlie sheen has been winning,
winning,

129
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:23.640
<v 3>winning,
winning tiger blood.</v>

130
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:28.890
And then the trend topics right now is what's dead in 2011 why?

131
00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.410
Why can't you just so I'm sure.
It's like,

132
00:07:31.411 --> 00:07:34.360
why can't you just pick up your baby girl?
When you say to pick up your pens,

133
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:39.540
this one's asked a little twist.
Okay.
See knows is perfect for your fans.

134
00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:42.270
I'm sure I'm not,
I don't think he's a scientist.

135
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:46.410
I'm going to say he doesn't teach much.

136
00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:52.210
<v 1>Google little twist.
I'm
guessing a child wrapper.</v>

137
00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:56.620
Whenever something like this happens,
I get,
I really feel so out of it.
Man.

138
00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:59.770
When I hear about this child born in 93 Jesus Christ,

139
00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:03.850
he was born when I was auditioning for news radio at graduate.

140
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:08.200
That's when he shot out of his mom's box 93 wow.
I was still in college.

141
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.160
His name is Christopher Elmore.
Born January 11th,

142
00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.670
1993 better known as his stage name,
Lil twist hall.

143
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:19.120
He's a rapper,
an American rapper from Dallas.

144
00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.850
He signed onto Lil Wayne's label.
Oh,

145
00:08:21.851 --> 00:08:26.010
that's why he's lil little twists Lil Wayne.
I don't rapper.

146
00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:28.770
I don't understand a little ones under six feet is what they would probably say

147
00:08:28.780 --> 00:08:31.480
a little.
Wayne is a fascinating cultural icon to me.

148
00:08:31.510 --> 00:08:36.400
I watch his music and I am completely perplexed.
It's like a language.

149
00:08:36.401 --> 00:08:40.220
I just do not speak.
It doesn't,
whatever it is,
it just doesn't get me.
I don't,

150
00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:44.410
I don't understand it.
They are fucking,
he is huge man.

151
00:08:44.411 --> 00:08:49.330
He is gigantic.
Massive.
He's,
he couldn't be bigger.
He's one easy.

152
00:08:49.331 --> 00:08:51.090
The biggest rapper ever or one of them?
Yes.
You see

153
00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:55.080
<v 3>as the biggest rapper,
his,
the most commercially successful rapper right now.</v>

154
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:56.190
I think probably ever.

155
00:08:56.810 --> 00:08:58.460
<v 1>I feel like I should give them another chance.</v>

156
00:08:58.461 --> 00:09:01.150
I feel like some reason why I'm here,

157
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:05.080
<v 3>here comes the black end me out earlier stuff is much better than his later</v>

158
00:09:05.081 --> 00:09:09.420
stuff.
When he was at the hot boys,
he was amazing.

159
00:09:09.421 --> 00:09:11.050
I ran into him in juvenile it,

160
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:14.720
him juvenile and like they had a man who was four of them at,
at,
at,

161
00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.250
at New Orleans and his earlier stuff.
He was good man.

162
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:19.410
He had rhymes that will blow you away.
Wow.

163
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:23.970
So now everyone just go on the little twist ankle twist trend topic and ask very

164
00:09:23.971 --> 00:09:25.200
insightful questions that you know,

165
00:09:25.210 --> 00:09:28.320
little twist doesn't have the answer for just non gold.
Try to be racist.

166
00:09:28.321 --> 00:09:31.140
The whole goal is not to be racist.
It's just to be like,
seriously?

167
00:09:31.141 --> 00:09:32.270
Do you think there's,
you know,

168
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:35.620
light forms out in the universal twist and like just see what little twists.

169
00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:38.150
<v 1>His answer's really is an answer for that and listen,
a little twist,</v>

170
00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:40.430
we're up to the Internet.
He might be smart as fuck.
Yeah.

171
00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.510
The thing about kids today man,
you can never underestimate them.

172
00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.270
It's not like they don't have the same access to information that we do.

173
00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.360
When we were kids we were retarded because no one told the shit.

174
00:09:49.570 --> 00:09:52.180
We are figuring things out like little monkeys just wandering around our

175
00:09:52.181 --> 00:09:54.670
neighborhoods,
but now there's no more neighborhoods.
Man.

176
00:09:54.671 --> 00:09:59.320
This is the whole world man.
Those stupid rumors that you heard about dude,

177
00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:04.180
I heard that Rod Stewart Hud to get his stomach pumped and there was a gallon of

178
00:10:04.181 --> 00:10:08.710
speaks Berman's od,
you know like those,
those stupid fucking stories.

179
00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:13.690
Only w w w like lingered and worked because we didn't have anything else.

180
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:17.380
You know,
that shit would never fly today.
Like do Richard Gere,

181
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:21.620
which by the way I heard was my herd.
This is my room.
Um,

182
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:25.570
I heard that that was Scientology spreading that rumor to fuck with him because

183
00:10:25.571 --> 00:10:28.830
he left Scientology.
Yeah,
that's what I'd heard.
I just,

184
00:10:28.850 --> 00:10:32.150
I might have just made that shit up.
What's,
what's good school?
Good out here.

185
00:10:32.490 --> 00:10:35.910
<v 3>I'll tell you the,
so this is the trend topic I started was,</v>

186
00:10:35.911 --> 00:10:39.240
and this is what this brings it back to our conversation yesterday I started

187
00:10:39.241 --> 00:10:41.880
doing a trend topic.
What will the main think when she sees this?

188
00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.830
That was the trend topic.
Okay.

189
00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:48.120
So then I started leaving the hotel room in a manner so that the maid walked in.

190
00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:48.781
She would go,

191
00:10:48.781 --> 00:10:53.010
what the fuck happened in here at now you're on your Twitter right now.

192
00:10:53.250 --> 00:10:56.220
I'm just going to tweet these Joe.
And I'm telling you when I say this,

193
00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:57.780
this might be my opus.

194
00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.570
This might be the funniest than anything of our dominant stage.

195
00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:04.920
I definitely think that I'm on the home page and I'm tweeting tweet.

196
00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:09.000
I'm tweeting the first and there I am assigned to you.
So this is the,

197
00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:10.350
and it's going chronologically.

198
00:11:10.351 --> 00:11:14.270
I've gotten much better as you'll see my later work look much like little wanes.

199
00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:18.500
So your early inspired shit was really good.

200
00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:20.070
I just started getting to the next level.

201
00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.060
Like Adam Richman's started doing them too and then he started challenging me on

202
00:11:24.061 --> 00:11:27.270
Twitter and then people were like,
dude,
you guys are fucking,

203
00:11:27.271 --> 00:11:30.030
and then I started like really thinking out of the box and I got into this

204
00:11:30.031 --> 00:11:33.510
Jackson Pollock hyper like tweet the shits on.
I'm trying to,

205
00:11:33.511 --> 00:11:36.270
we know all the written it.
Where the fuck is it?
It's coming up right now.

206
00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.650
And so I got into this like manic state when I was in New York to impress and I

207
00:11:40.651 --> 00:11:44.010
was trying to come out with them to promote the show and I was getting some good

208
00:11:44.011 --> 00:11:47.880
ones man.
Like really fucking impressive.
I mean like some good shit.

209
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:50.550
I guarantee you there's artists on Twitter that go,

210
00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.530
you've got great conceptual boundaries or whatever.

211
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:56.530
<v 2>I'm telling you Joe,
user artists on Twitter,</v>

212
00:11:56.531 --> 00:11:59.080
they can teach you how to tweet up a fucking twit.
Here we go.

213
00:11:59.140 --> 00:12:01.200
It's coming up right now,
sending tweet.
There we go.

214
00:12:01.201 --> 00:12:03.080
Who's your cell phone service?
Cricket one.

215
00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:07.630
There's a second one and a third one should be coming up to,
oh my goodness.

216
00:12:07.631 --> 00:12:11.770
Here we go.
Here we go.
What will the main think when she sees this?
Okay.

217
00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:16.870
Blind clicking.
Completely blind.
Okay,
I click this.
Oh,

218
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:22.180
he's got the bed made up.
Look like a nun.
Now mind you.
This is my early work.

219
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:27.200
Wait,
wait til you go through it and see how good has got.
I'll read.

220
00:12:27.201 --> 00:12:30.070
Tweet it.
I'll retweet it so you can get a bed.
Fucking beautiful.

221
00:12:30.071 --> 00:12:33.280
There's a bunch of them when you were,
I've got more than I could post right now.

222
00:12:33.370 --> 00:12:36.820
I just went to this new stuff on the road.

223
00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:40.640
Look at number two with that one though.

224
00:12:40.650 --> 00:12:45.650
This frigerator will looks like Amanda Body Torso with clothes.

225
00:12:45.851 --> 00:12:48.580
That's hilarious.
This is my,
I'm telling you,
I'm in.
Meanwhile,

226
00:12:48.581 --> 00:12:50.490
the real sad part is and means probably not going to see it.

227
00:12:50.491 --> 00:12:51.850
It's gonna be the next guest.

228
00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.760
Fucking amazing cleaning that Lazy Bitch.
She's tired.

229
00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.640
I talk about this all the time,
but I always,
the third one doesn't work,
Bro.

230
00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:04.730
The third link doesn't work.
I would go now go to the,
go to the latest recent

231
00:13:07.150 --> 00:13:11.610
paper.
Anything.
I'm fucking,
he made a fuck a dog.

232
00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:15.930
This is hilarious.
It was talking about three hours,
three hours.

233
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.910
Fucking hotel room.
Just whacked out with a bottle of wine areas.

234
00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:22.880
Just I retweeted the first and let me retreat the second one.

235
00:13:22.881 --> 00:13:24.880
This hotel in Portland,
we are just in.

236
00:13:24.881 --> 00:13:28.300
I easily do the whole come thing and I don't know.
I don't really do that.

237
00:13:28.301 --> 00:13:30.850
I don't really normally do it as much as I say.

238
00:13:30.851 --> 00:13:32.830
I am not saying I haven't done that,

239
00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:36.890
but this time I decided to do it because I was in bed and I was like,
look,

240
00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.740
I didn't want to wipe it on the bed and want to get out,

241
00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:43.890
so I threw it like kind of up behind me and it went straight down on my iPhone.

242
00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:49.330
Good.
I hope it gave your iPhone eight and Karma.
I hope your iPhone dies.

243
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:52.400
Do you think [inaudible] starts getting a cough?
We're,

244
00:13:52.401 --> 00:13:54.370
we're talking about bird crushes.
Hilarious pictures.

245
00:13:54.371 --> 00:13:57.280
You got to talk about shooting your own lower hotels.
No,

246
00:13:57.281 --> 00:14:00.130
we're talking about some,
my very specific thing that this guy's doing.

247
00:14:00.131 --> 00:14:04.900
It's very hilarious.
I love the birth conquer one Sunday at eight genius.

248
00:14:05.330 --> 00:14:07.900
That's genius.
Tweeted all these folks.

249
00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:10.300
And if you're listening to this on the podcast,

250
00:14:10.301 --> 00:14:12.220
go back to the day that we recorded this,

251
00:14:12.221 --> 00:14:17.221
which is April 5th on Tuesday 3:30 PM Pacific Time.

252
00:14:17.711 --> 00:14:20.500
So if you want to find those tweets because they'll get lost in the mix.

253
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:22.900
That's hilarious.
Yeah,
they're very funny.

254
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:26.380
And then I was talking to have fraud on the other day on doing radio and he was

255
00:14:26.381 --> 00:14:29.230
in Pittsburgh and headphones.
Like I love those pictures.
I was like,

256
00:14:29.231 --> 00:14:31.780
why don't you do them?
And he was like,
he was like,
I,
you know,

257
00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:33.430
I thought of it but I didn't want to steal it.

258
00:14:33.431 --> 00:14:35.680
Like I don't want to do it and feel like a stolen,
like go have fun.

259
00:14:35.890 --> 00:14:38.770
And this is to any comic listening.
I don't give a shit do it.

260
00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:40.680
But you got to tweet it to me cause I want to see it.
Right.

261
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:43.780
I don't want to copy your shit one day.
Right.
So this is the tweet.
It's,

262
00:14:43.781 --> 00:14:46.420
what would the main,
what is the,
uh,
the Hashtag,

263
00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:47.800
I didn't put the Hashtag in there,

264
00:14:47.801 --> 00:14:50.460
but what would the main think when she sees this?
And that's why all one word,

265
00:14:50.461 --> 00:14:53.060
all one word.
What would the maid think when she sees this?

266
00:14:53.061 --> 00:14:56.390
And just tweet it to Burt and let's,
let's fucking get his one is great.
The,

267
00:14:56.391 --> 00:14:58.570
I have the guy who's jumping out the window.
Yeah,

268
00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.700
I did that one in Canada last minute and they all happen at the last minute.

269
00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:07.000
That's hilarious.
Yeah.
So this one,
fags,
look at this,
this,

270
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:11.180
this,
that's the one had in Richmond.
He was like,
he was like,
you cheated.
I go,

271
00:15:11.181 --> 00:15:13.520
what do you mean I cheated?
He goes,
you fucking,

272
00:15:13.550 --> 00:15:16.880
you gotta use the Shit in the room.
And I go,
no,
I use the shit in the room.

273
00:15:16.881 --> 00:15:20.900
That's towels,
Napkins and catch up.
And he was like,
what the fuck did,

274
00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:24.920
he just owned him?
That's why he's upset.
He,
you can't compete with this.

275
00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:27.320
I would quit the game if you were playing this game.
I'd be like,

276
00:15:27.321 --> 00:15:30.420
this guy's Ted playing this game way serious or than I am barely.

277
00:15:30.421 --> 00:15:30.860
We need to have,

278
00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:33.380
you need to have a part on your website that has a collection of these cause

279
00:15:33.381 --> 00:15:35.840
that if that becomes big,
which I,
it seems like it would be,

280
00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:39.460
you need to be the center homebase of essay should go home and immediately did

281
00:15:39.690 --> 00:15:42.240
it.
Travel Channel got Ahold of it and they're like,
they're like with all that,

282
00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.020
we want to use it to promote the show.
We're going to do a caption contest.

283
00:15:45.021 --> 00:15:47.380
We're going to do,
we want to send them out and they're not,

284
00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:49.370
and then they called one day I was in Mexico and they're like,

285
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:53.240
and I wasn't sleeping.
And they're like,
I need,
we need seven more.
Why have seven?

286
00:15:53.241 --> 00:15:56.300
What the fuck do you think I'm a meth?
How am I going to come up with seven?

287
00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:59.300
And they're like,
just do it.
Just do it.
And I was like,
I couldn't.

288
00:15:59.301 --> 00:16:03.530
And I was sitting in Mexico fucking no TV listening to the Joe Rogan podcast on

289
00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:08.170
experience on my iPad in bed with me in a pillow next to me cause I couldn't,

290
00:16:08.171 --> 00:16:11.030
I was,
I was having anxiety and I was fucking flipping out and it's like,

291
00:16:11.090 --> 00:16:12.500
it's the best.
I would put it on low.

292
00:16:12.501 --> 00:16:15.860
So I feel like friends or talking in the next room puts me to sleep.

293
00:16:15.861 --> 00:16:20.540
I just sit there and I just,
and then you wake up and you hear dog,
dog,
dog Joey.

294
00:16:21.050 --> 00:16:24.490
He wakes me up every time.
Anytime he talks to you,

295
00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:28.580
more people complain about Joey and his volume control is Joey.

296
00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:32.100
Joey will lean back like this list.
Here's what the problem is,
Joanne,

297
00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:35.560
we got a fucking problem there.
Brian just fucking cock sucker.

298
00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:40.710
And then I'll get right up in there and you're like,
oh Jesus Christ.
Yeah,

299
00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:43.970
he's someone I feel like I really missed.
I don't even think I want to meet him.

300
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:47.210
Like I just,
cause I want to just have him be the personality he is.
You know,

301
00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:50.030
he is Joey,
you don't got to worry about meeting them.
Yeah.

302
00:16:50.031 --> 00:16:52.670
It's even better than me.
Yeah,
you meet them and your love him.
He's,

303
00:16:52.671 --> 00:16:54.920
he's the most unique human being I've ever met.
Well,

304
00:16:54.921 --> 00:16:57.590
he tells a story about his mom.
I don't like his,
his stories.

305
00:16:57.591 --> 00:16:59.450
He tells a story and it's,
he's the best,

306
00:16:59.451 --> 00:17:02.690
one of the best storytellers because he leaves out the parts that make you stop

307
00:17:02.691 --> 00:17:05.750
and wonder.
And then right when you're wondering,
he hits you with a fucking joke,

308
00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:09.800
but he tells you the story about like the playing cards with his mom.
Gay.

309
00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:14.510
I don't think so.
I guess he was,
I thought there were lesbians in the story,

310
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.180
but there and she'd go shake your hand Joey.
Shake your hand.

311
00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.910
Shake his name and his underwear.
This sounds like a fucking TV show.

312
00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:25.400
Like I don't know how this guy has not gotten a TV show.

313
00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:28.730
One of the most interesting guys I've ever fucking list.
It's so crazy.

314
00:17:28.790 --> 00:17:32.000
That's why.
Remember when he got pissed off for nothing?

315
00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:34.040
We were on the way to the Gig.
Right?

316
00:17:34.041 --> 00:17:36.800
And they were in the lobby and the show starts in like,
Yo,

317
00:17:36.801 --> 00:17:39.910
I'm 20 minutes or 15 minutes,
wherever the fuck it is.
And so,
um,

318
00:17:39.970 --> 00:17:43.100
I had a downstairs dog.
I've been waiting for you down here for half an hour dog.

319
00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:45.710
When we be hanging there like this,
I go,
don't worry about it.

320
00:17:45.711 --> 00:17:48.320
When the show starts,
when we get there,
come on dog.
You know me dog.

321
00:17:48.321 --> 00:17:50.100
I get you can't leave

322
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.280
<v 4>me hanging here like this dog and he wouldn't drop and he got crazy.</v>

323
00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:57.220
<v 5>It got to like the like that times five more levels like dogs.</v>

324
00:17:57.290 --> 00:17:58.470
You don't have to give me respect.

325
00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:04.530
<v 4>Nikki,
lead Donny and waiting for your dog.
What are you talking about Joey?</v>

326
00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:05.850
It will take it.
Meanwhile,

327
00:18:05.851 --> 00:18:08.910
I'm trying to discuss whether or not I should tell him that I had to take a

328
00:18:08.911 --> 00:18:13.310
meaty shit.
Took a little longer than I thought it was going to take a look.

329
00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.560
It's not like I don't want to be on time for my own fucking show.
All right,

330
00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:21.510
we're here.
No one's dying.
Carrie will be there in five minutes forever.

331
00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:24.630
I've known him for like 1112 years now,

332
00:18:24.930 --> 00:18:28.980
maybe even 13 I might've met him and yeah,
it might be 13 years.
Fuck,

333
00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:29.670
that's crazy.

334
00:18:29.670 --> 00:18:33.270
<v 5>He was drawing a picture in the green room while Joe was talking to some friends</v>

335
00:18:33.271 --> 00:18:36.090
and he goes,
pride record this.
And I'm like,
what?
And I'm like,
okay.

336
00:18:36.091 --> 00:18:36.990
So I started recording him,

337
00:18:36.991 --> 00:18:39.540
just drawing something and then he pulls up the Sinus,

338
00:18:39.541 --> 00:18:43.440
says Brian Loves Taylor Vixen,
who's my ex.
And I'm like,
what the fuck?

339
00:18:43.441 --> 00:18:47.490
And then he pulls out his balls and puts his balls behind it and I'm just like,

340
00:18:47.491 --> 00:18:49.920
Jesus Christ man.
It's like Joey Diaz.

341
00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:54.810
His balls in a room that's small is deadly.
I bet his balls are massive.

342
00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:57.570
It's massive.
When two queers should go get a room.

343
00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:02.453
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

344
00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:05.980
But what Joey did is he made a funny video to Brian's x cause Brian and made a

345
00:19:05.981 --> 00:19:10.130
couple of other funny videos.
He just,
he's torturing her,
torturing her.

346
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:14.560
Joey D is,
it's torturing me.
Then you sending him.
Oh,
I'm sending them together.

347
00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:18.540
Funny.
I think it's funny night.
Like torture.
It's not touch her.

348
00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:22.930
I'm not saying torture like you're hurting her.
Torture also means fun.
You know,

349
00:19:22.931 --> 00:19:23.880
like,
oh,
he's fucking torture.

350
00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:27.220
It doesn't necessarily mean you're trying to hurt her.
I see she has an RSS feed.

351
00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:31.000
I don't even know what that right.
Shut the fuck up please.
Oh,

352
00:19:31.001 --> 00:19:33.280
is this the whole fucking bill burr argument?
Oh,
by the way,

353
00:19:33.281 --> 00:19:35.390
which continued on to build burrs,
podcasts,

354
00:19:35.391 --> 00:19:38.490
and now apparently under Greg Fitzsimmons is podcasts shut up,

355
00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:41.500
which is even more ridiculous.
I was did,
it's so disappointing.
And Bill,

356
00:19:41.501 --> 00:19:46.090
when I heard him talking on his own podcast about it,
I'm like,
wow,
you're re,

357
00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:49.930
and then here's the worst part about,
he goes,
and I just want it to say I won.

358
00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:55.430
I tried to talk to my lawyer.
My lawyer said that I could sue.
Okay,

359
00:19:56.050 --> 00:19:58.840
I won.
And I was like,
Jesus Christ.

360
00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:03.310
So many go find bill and give him a fucking hug.
That guy,

361
00:20:03.311 --> 00:20:06.010
it's so ironic that bill was talking shit about people who smoke weed.

362
00:20:06.011 --> 00:20:09.270
If anybody needs wait,
it's built by.
Oh,
he could definitely use a bulleted.

363
00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:15.510
Super intense.
That's what everyone in Boston is like.
Yeah,

364
00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:19.360
very similar.
Yeah,
it's a hard place.
And that's why comedy there,

365
00:20:19.361 --> 00:20:23.530
it's such a good place to grow up and start doing comedy because you learn very

366
00:20:23.531 --> 00:20:26.860
early on to appreciate people's attention spans because they will fucking blew

367
00:20:26.861 --> 00:20:31.240
you off the stage with the quickness.
We did.
We did.
I did a show.

368
00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:37.120
What was the comedy connection coming to connections and new hall Jamieson tour.

369
00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:41.770
It was me,
Billy Gardell,
uh,
Steve Bernan,
Danny Bevins I think.
Yeah.

370
00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:46.810
And we had to do the show to get renewed to do the show to get the tour renewed.

371
00:20:46.811 --> 00:20:48.190
So the tour was a dick

372
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:49.380
<v 3>load of money for us.
Right.</v>

373
00:20:49.420 --> 00:20:53.890
It was like a pho four grand a weekend and you only had to do is 20 minutes.
Wow.

374
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:56.170
And Billy Gardell is like Billy,
I mean this is,

375
00:20:56.171 --> 00:20:58.060
I probably shouldn't talk about at a school about Billy,

376
00:20:58.061 --> 00:21:01.060
but Billy had just quit drinking and he's sober now,

377
00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:05.680
but had just quit drinking like that Thursday and was like,

378
00:21:05.681 --> 00:21:09.190
I'm never touching it again.
And we've got to go and he's fucking freaking out.

379
00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:10.540
And he's like,
you got to close the show.

380
00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.120
And I got to follow like three guys and they're all fucking bang,

381
00:21:13.121 --> 00:21:14.860
Bang Bang in Boston.

382
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:18.370
And I'm nervous about doing well in Boston because I kind of do race.

383
00:21:18.371 --> 00:21:21.340
I used to do a lot of race stuff then and I was like fuck.

384
00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:24.310
And I just came out the gates and I was like,
and just,

385
00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:27.220
I just gave it everything I had just Bam,
Bam,
Bam,
Bam.

386
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:30.460
And then like 15 minutes in,
I'm like,
if I can kind of keep this energy going,

387
00:21:30.670 --> 00:21:33.970
then we fucking,
and I had a good set and we got the tour renewed.
But uh,

388
00:21:34.090 --> 00:21:36.850
of course just fucking dumped on some black guy in the front row of the whole

389
00:21:36.851 --> 00:21:39.400
time.
He loved that he was with a white check.
She had red hair.

390
00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:43.000
Is that some weird when the girl was like,
Huh?
But that was,
yeah,

391
00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:45.060
if I was my only experience in Boston.
Yeah.

392
00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:48.920
<v 1>Boston's a fun place.
Fun Town.
Too Bad.
It gets too cold.
Never lived there again.</v>

393
00:21:48.950 --> 00:21:52.730
Sorry.
Love you guys.
I couldn't live there.
Great place for comedy though.

394
00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:55.340
When you live in a place where it's done fucking harsh,
you know,

395
00:21:55.370 --> 00:21:58.850
that kind of an environment.
And now,
I mean it's,
well you think,
you know,

396
00:21:58.851 --> 00:22:01.640
a lot of good comics come out of la too.
So that argument kind of sucks.

397
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:06.700
But we'll start in la.
Yeah.
Some of them do.
Who?
I've met some comics.

398
00:22:06.701 --> 00:22:10.610
It started out here.
Holtzman star right here,
didn't he?
He did.
Right.
I know.

399
00:22:10.611 --> 00:22:13.850
I know guys who've started out here that are really good.
It's um,

400
00:22:14.030 --> 00:22:14.970
I mean you could start anywhere,
man.

401
00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:18.520
<v 3>I started in New York.
I did it once in Tallahassee and a,</v>

402
00:22:18.521 --> 00:22:19.620
and then move right to New York.

403
00:22:19.621 --> 00:22:24.410
Did it in New York and got my lunch buddy taken really fucking quick.
But just,

404
00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.190
I though my first time ever on stage,

405
00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:30.270
this Guy Louis Shaffer was like I said I wanted to be a comic.
So I,
and it was,

406
00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:31.170
it's a long story.

407
00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:34.320
My Dad gave me one of those phone calls you don't ever want to have from a

408
00:22:34.321 --> 00:22:36.690
parrot where he called me one morning on my birthday,

409
00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:40.350
I'm expecting a birthday phone call and he calls me.
He's like,
you're pathetic.

410
00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:43.140
You make me sick to my stomach.
Well,
I'm embarrassed of you.

411
00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:45.660
You said you were going to be a comic.
You got rolling stone,

412
00:22:45.661 --> 00:22:48.270
wrote an article about you and you said you're going to move and be a comic and

413
00:22:48.271 --> 00:22:50.850
you've been there eight months and you haven't done shit.
And I lie,

414
00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:54.050
I lie about you.
Like judges say,
how's your son doing?
And I lie.

415
00:22:54.051 --> 00:22:57.540
Do you know what that makes me feel like?
And I'm just,
it's my first day.
Oh,

416
00:22:57.580 --> 00:22:59.100
sitting,
hung over on my end,

417
00:22:59.101 --> 00:23:01.860
my underwear on my couch that I grew up on in New York.

418
00:23:01.861 --> 00:23:05.160
I had had it up there and my dad's just like,
and I was like,

419
00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:07.800
he's like our failed you as a parent.
I failed you.
You have no humility.

420
00:23:07.801 --> 00:23:11.250
I don't know what to do.
Just keep doing what you do.
I guess.
Get a fucking job.

421
00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:16.200
I was,
we have no humility.
I had,
I had no humility at the time.
I just didn't,

422
00:23:16.201 --> 00:23:19.380
I didn't have the,
like I was like,
I want to be a comic,

423
00:23:19.381 --> 00:23:22.140
but I didn't know how to go about getting it because I felt like I was too good

424
00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.590
to work the door or to,
you know.

425
00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:28.750
Does that make any sense when I say that I felt like I was too,
I was,

426
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:32.370
I was too good to just get in at the ground level.
I wanted to be discovered.

427
00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:37.290
I want it to be
brought down on.
I don't know.
I mean that's just,

428
00:23:37.291 --> 00:23:40.590
I think a lot of people are like,
yeah,
I think a lot of people that,

429
00:23:40.591 --> 00:23:45.060
how old were you?
26 and also,
yeah.
And I was too young to,

430
00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:49.340
the open mic scene was all alternative comedy and like Demitri Martin and I

431
00:23:49.341 --> 00:23:52.670
started around the same time and Dimitri just got welcomed by them and I hung

432
00:23:52.671 --> 00:23:55.730
out and no one ever talked to me and I was like,
ah,
fucking great.

433
00:23:55.850 --> 00:23:58.850
So then I just hung out the comedy clubs and drank in the back of company.

434
00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:01.880
<v 1>You know what I've always found ironic about alternative comedy is it,</v>

435
00:24:01.881 --> 00:24:05.900
a lot of alternative comics were like outcasts and they,
you know,
they felt like,

436
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:09.660
you know,
they were kind of nerds or whatever you will.

437
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:12.770
And meanwhile they're like the least welcoming the most,

438
00:24:12.771 --> 00:24:16.940
I mean end the weirdest like backstabbing dish caddy ish.

439
00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:20.750
It's very strange that you would think that the people that were picked on would

440
00:24:20.751 --> 00:24:23.300
be like really open and warm and friendly.

441
00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:26.370
<v 3>Yeah,
they were,
they were brutal.
I would go to,
uh,
uh,</v>

442
00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:30.600
I forget the name of the fucking surf reality and a collective unconscious and I

443
00:24:30.601 --> 00:24:33.150
would hang out,
try to do sets and no one would speak to me.

444
00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:36.090
No one would speak to me and I would just be sitting there and Dimitri would

445
00:24:36.091 --> 00:24:39.330
talk to me and then he literally would come and talk to me and then walk away

446
00:24:39.331 --> 00:24:41.850
and talk to all of them and then come back and talk to me.

447
00:24:41.970 --> 00:24:45.360
And I was just fucking and,
but I never felt like it all turns that you though.

448
00:24:45.361 --> 00:24:46.141
Or is it though?

449
00:24:46.141 --> 00:24:48.930
I would try to talk to people and whenever I said they'd make fun of me,

450
00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:51.990
like I remember he would make fun of you first.
Anything out of my mouth,

451
00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:57.020
they just go,
ah,
okay.
Okay.
And this is the comics.
This is the comics.
Yeah.

452
00:24:57.450 --> 00:24:59.820
Yeah,
because they wanted you to feel uncomfortable.

453
00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:03.260
We wanted me to feel horrible.
Isn't that weird?
Oh,
it's the worst.
And then I'm,

454
00:25:03.261 --> 00:25:08.120
and then I'd go to,
I go to common though.
Oh,
go,
go.
I'm,
I'm the,

455
00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:12.420
I'm generalizing and I don't want to do that,
but go hang out at fucking,

456
00:25:13.170 --> 00:25:16.170
I'm trying to think of UCB,
UCB and see how,

457
00:25:16.171 --> 00:25:19.500
like I know Tom said he went and did the,
they have a comic book.

458
00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:21.540
<v 1>I did a set there once and I had a great time.</v>

459
00:25:21.541 --> 00:25:25.530
I only did it once and I remember somebody pointed me to thread somewhere where

460
00:25:25.531 --> 00:25:27.180
the people said they actually enjoy the show,
but they were like,

461
00:25:27.181 --> 00:25:28.050
what the fuck is Joe Rogan

462
00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:31.170
<v 3>hear it?
That's so stupid.
But</v>

463
00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:33.820
<v 1>it is,
but it isn't.
You know what I mean?
They're,</v>

464
00:25:33.821 --> 00:25:36.660
they're expecting a certain particular type of comedy that maybe makes them feel

465
00:25:36.661 --> 00:25:36.940
good,

466
00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:40.000
<v 3>but your comedy is the same.
That's what really upsets not upsets me.</v>

467
00:25:40.001 --> 00:25:43.690
I don't give you shit personally.
I'm not looking to get spots at a,

468
00:25:43.691 --> 00:25:48.370
at a comic bookstore,
but I did a comic book store,
Jet Tubs,
gorgeous,

469
00:25:48.371 --> 00:25:52.140
did one,
and he said he was great.
I did it for a Dunkin.
It was awesome.
Dunkin,

470
00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:55.930
but Duncan Duncan is kind of welcomed.
It was welcomed everywhere.

471
00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:59.350
Don't get genius.
He can float between worlds,
but what were you saying?

472
00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:02.710
So I had no humility.
That's what they get,
what it gets to,
and it was just,

473
00:26:02.711 --> 00:26:04.120
I would sit in the back of comedy clubs.
I think

474
00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:06.720
<v 1>this,
how does this translate?
This is where I'm confused.</v>

475
00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:09.900
You say you say you have no humility.
At the time you thought you were too good,

476
00:26:09.901 --> 00:26:12.510
but yet here you are in these alternative rooms and everyone's treating me like

477
00:26:12.511 --> 00:26:14.280
shit.
Do you think they're connected?

478
00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:15.121
<v 3>I'm sure there were.</v>

479
00:26:15.121 --> 00:26:19.770
I'm sure that my perception of what the status quo of comedy clubs was perceived

480
00:26:19.771 --> 00:26:21.450
from way I'd been treated,
but I'd go to,

481
00:26:21.451 --> 00:26:25.380
I'd go to like the Boston comedy club with the seller and I'd say hide it to

482
00:26:25.381 --> 00:26:28.600
tell and Norton,
they were all cool,
but they,
you know,

483
00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:32.010
they were also working comics and I was,
that's what I wanted to be.

484
00:26:32.220 --> 00:26:34.260
And I think my dad,
well my dad's note was,

485
00:26:34.261 --> 00:26:37.890
was my dad's kind of guy that if he wanted something he would get it and he'd go

486
00:26:38.010 --> 00:26:40.560
and he'd say,
this is what I want.
Can you please help me get this?

487
00:26:40.561 --> 00:26:43.410
And I would not that guy just hanging out in the back of the club and go in

488
00:26:43.411 --> 00:26:44.130
their defense,

489
00:26:44.130 --> 00:26:46.770
<v 4>in any buns defense when it comes to hanging out when new people,
man,</v>

490
00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:50.940
I try to be as friendly and as open with everybody that I can.
New Comics,

491
00:26:50.941 --> 00:26:53.880
I love talking to new comics,
but man,
there's a certain point in time,

492
00:26:53.881 --> 00:26:56.490
sometimes in the middle of a conversation when you realize,
Oh,

493
00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:00.990
I'm stuck talking to this dummy.
You know that that's annoying man.

494
00:27:00.991 --> 00:27:03.450
When you have a good group and a good vibe,
you know,

495
00:27:03.451 --> 00:27:07.060
so maybe you came off like too loud or too,
he didn't say a word really.

496
00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:09.930
I was mad.
I will be your stage.
Your Act.

497
00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.630
I went from this toy they judging you from.
He never got on stage.

498
00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:16.740
So what were they judging you from?
Uh,
I was nice.
I everyone liked me but that I,

499
00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:18.180
the alternative people didn't.
What would the,

500
00:27:18.181 --> 00:27:21.060
you must have said a word because you said that they were mocking you for saying

501
00:27:21.061 --> 00:27:22.940
anything.
Oh,
the alternative comics.
Yeah,

502
00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:24.950
I'd go up and I would didn't know how to do stand up.
Oh,

503
00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.200
so you did go up on stage in front of them.
Reality and collective unconscious,

504
00:27:28.201 --> 00:27:30.450
but you paid three bucks and go up at the end of the night.

505
00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:33.260
That was how that those rooms work.
Right?

506
00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.470
Well then you can understand why they didn't want to talk to you.
Right.

507
00:27:35.490 --> 00:27:39.200
I can understand that.
They want to talk to me,
brought me back to the fuck.

508
00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:41.730
I mean we're just,
I have to break down everything.

509
00:27:41.731 --> 00:27:44.760
That's where they weren't funny either.
It's not like anyone was of course.
Right.

510
00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:48.750
They would laugh at whatever they said because they had said it and it also was

511
00:27:48.751 --> 00:27:51.740
a certain sensibility to write.
My Shit was like,

512
00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:55.950
I was trying to be funny in any comedy club anyway.

513
00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:58.950
We're trying to be funny in any comic con was just trying to be funny.

514
00:27:58.950 --> 00:28:01.110
I didn't know what I didn't know there's a difference in alternative.

515
00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:04.820
There isn't.
I didn't know we were talking about that before.
You know about this.

516
00:28:04.821 --> 00:28:07.890
This guy that they were saying is the founder of alternative comedy and we both

517
00:28:07.891 --> 00:28:10.200
agreed like he's not even an alternative comics.
Just a comic,

518
00:28:10.680 --> 00:28:11.730
you know what does that even mean?

519
00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:15.630
You know who I think was the the founder of alternative comedy as far as I know,

520
00:28:15.631 --> 00:28:18.960
if it all came out of Boston supposedly it all came out and catch a rising star.

521
00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:22.710
It was David Cross Cause David Cross was doing like really weird shit.

522
00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:26.340
He was named Martin.
Oh well Steve Martin is a an icon.

523
00:28:26.341 --> 00:28:30.330
I mean Steve Martin is a different thing.
He's not what David Cross did.

524
00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:32.340
Here's one of the things he did.
Let me give you an example.

525
00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:37.400
He put on a stretching tape for like a warmup exercise tape and then he starts

526
00:28:37.921 --> 00:28:42.270
stretching and talking on stage about a stretching and it was,
I don't know why,

527
00:28:42.271 --> 00:28:44.580
but it was silly.
It was,
there was something funny about it,

528
00:28:44.581 --> 00:28:48.150
but it was completely ridiculous that he was just taking this chance to go

529
00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:50.760
onstage.
But like a lot of people weren't laughing,

530
00:28:50.790 --> 00:28:53.460
but everybody has a smile on their face.
Like,
what the fuck is he doing?

531
00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:56.460
It was fun.
Steve Martin was a comic.
He's just silly.

532
00:28:57.390 --> 00:29:00.810
I'll often did a lot of alternative stuff on stage,
you know,
alternative stuff.

533
00:29:00.811 --> 00:29:03.310
Like what?
Like he would do banjo stuff.

534
00:29:03.311 --> 00:29:06.050
He would do like banjos alternative.

535
00:29:06.110 --> 00:29:09.330
That's not an alternative alternative.

536
00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:13.860
The idea of alternative is like hipster.
It's like Nerdy,

537
00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:18.150
super smart,
you know?
That's what alternative comedy supposed to be like.

538
00:29:18.151 --> 00:29:22.260
Not Too loud,
not too physical.
Steve Martin is the antithesis of that.

539
00:29:22.261 --> 00:29:25.650
He's the absolute opposite of what you would consider alternative comedy.

540
00:29:25.710 --> 00:29:30.120
I can't put my finger on alternative comedy per se.
Uh,
whether it is or it isn't,

541
00:29:30.121 --> 00:29:33.390
but I can put my finger on what alternative comics dislike.

542
00:29:33.810 --> 00:29:36.010
Like I can go on the road and go shower this guy.

543
00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:40.710
Would you see guys on the road where they're act as just like,
Ugh,

544
00:29:40.711 --> 00:29:42.040
bearable.
You're like,
Holy Shit.

545
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:46.420
<v 3>Well,
and I think what they think is that is the comedy that goes on,</v>

546
00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:50.110
not in UCB.
That is a comedy that's everywhere.
And that is like,

547
00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:53.230
I don't think a lot of them go on the road and see what you do on the road or

548
00:29:53.231 --> 00:29:55.510
see what the road's like.

549
00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.540
<v 1>Well,
eventually the road becomes the same everywhere.</v>

550
00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:02.800
I'm going to tell you that my crowds are there sometimes more enthusiastic in

551
00:30:02.801 --> 00:30:06.250
different towns,
but they're all the same now.
It's everybody's there.
They're all,

552
00:30:06.251 --> 00:30:08.890
they all know what I'm doing.
Yeah.
So it's,
it's not an issue anymore,

553
00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:12.190
but when you're young and no one knows who you are and you go on stage,

554
00:30:12.191 --> 00:30:16.150
if you're used to doing the UCB and getting those really polite laughs and

555
00:30:16.151 --> 00:30:19.440
chuckles in the back of the room with some witty,
uh,
you know,

556
00:30:19.450 --> 00:30:23.470
reference that you made,
you know,
to some fucking do novel.

557
00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:24.820
You know what I'm saying?

558
00:30:24.821 --> 00:30:28.090
Something about the spice and everyone in the UCB thinks it's so funny.

559
00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:31.420
Do that shit.
And Tallahassee,
Florida,
they'll throw bottles at you,
motherfucker.

560
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:35.650
You know there's a problem with,
you know,
when no one knows who you are,
man.

561
00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:38.230
That's when it's really tough.
When you're not bringing in your own crowd.

562
00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:42.280
You could get really soft easily if you're a name and you know,

563
00:30:42.281 --> 00:30:44.470
you have a bunch of people that come to see you all the time and you know,

564
00:30:44.471 --> 00:30:48.580
they give you so much love and they want you to succeed.
They want to laugh.

565
00:30:48.581 --> 00:30:51.850
They're not like,
they don't have any arms crossed staring at you sideways.
Yeah.

566
00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:55.320
<v 3>Good comedies,
good comedy.
I mean it like Patton.
Oswald makes me laugh.</v>

567
00:30:55.321 --> 00:30:58.940
I don't give a fuck what anyone says.
He makes me giggle.
You know,
like our first,

568
00:30:58.941 --> 00:31:01.440
one of my favorites,
first time I ever saw him on stage,
he was like,
dude,

569
00:31:01.441 --> 00:31:04.230
like he's really big in the alternative comedy scene.
And I was like,
Oh really?

570
00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.480
And then he just murdered and it wasn't alternative.
It was just funny.

571
00:31:06.530 --> 00:31:06.861
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

572
00:31:06.861 --> 00:31:11.060
Well that's big in the alternative comedy scene because he's a comic book nerd

573
00:31:11.061 --> 00:31:14.730
and he loves science fiction and you know,
he fits in physically,
you know,

574
00:31:14.731 --> 00:31:18.350
so the the except him.
But he's a great writer.
That's what he is.
He's,

575
00:31:18.351 --> 00:31:21.950
he's his modem to be bass.
I got it.
Yeah.
I haven't read it yet,

576
00:31:21.951 --> 00:31:22.784
but I picked it up,

577
00:31:23.450 --> 00:31:26.160
<v 3>put in perspective now to get to what,</v>

578
00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:29.940
to bring it full circle if this is possibly it at all possible.

579
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.290
So that is who I was in New York in 1997 trying to fit in,

580
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:39.470
trying to break my way into comedy through having beers with comics and not

581
00:31:39.690 --> 00:31:41.670
fitting in an alternative and not being,

582
00:31:41.671 --> 00:31:45.570
having the gumption or the gregariousness to break in in the,

583
00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:49.560
are you doing sets or was it I was,
I don't even know what the fuck I was doing.

584
00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:53.150
I was working out at Barnes and noble.
So you are working at Barnes and noble,

585
00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:57.600
you no working out,
working out,
uh,
this is bad.
You do sets of bonds?
No,

586
00:31:57.610 --> 00:32:00.780
most working at Barnes and noble and then working out during the day and the

587
00:32:00.781 --> 00:32:04.250
basement,
like I was fucking,
I got fired from Barnes and noble.

588
00:32:04.251 --> 00:32:07.770
This is the worst I was working at Barnes and noble and astro place.

589
00:32:07.770 --> 00:32:09.090
No fucking AC.

590
00:32:09.210 --> 00:32:12.420
And so everyday I would you ever have a job where you lift boxes and as you do

591
00:32:12.421 --> 00:32:15.190
you're like that's not a bad,
that's a good buy workout.
And you're like,
oh,

592
00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:17.990
all right,
I'll do a little bit of this.
And if I do this all day long,

593
00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:19.800
I'm fucking jacked buys by the end of the summer.

594
00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:23.490
So I'd go down to the basement and you can take the freight elevator.

595
00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:25.620
I'm going to sound like a psycho into five minutes.

596
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:28.800
You could take the freight elevator to the basement and no one could get down

597
00:32:28.801 --> 00:32:31.470
there cause you had the elevator.
And so once I got to the basement,

598
00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:36.060
I take off my clothes and start working out and just like do pushups,
sit ups,

599
00:32:36.180 --> 00:32:40.910
fucking curls with boxes,
whole books out,
two fucking these fucking jobs,

600
00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:44.120
front rows.
And I'd work out.
And then it was,
there was no AC.

601
00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:46.580
So then I'd wait till I cooled down,
put all my clothes back on,

602
00:32:46.790 --> 00:32:49.730
get the freight elevator walk up and I just killed like 30 minutes.

603
00:32:49.731 --> 00:32:52.730
When you have a job like that to kill 30 minutes is a,

604
00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:56.870
it's like fucking calm that much closer to being over done.
So I'm like,

605
00:32:56.871 --> 00:33:00.560
this is an eating ripped fuel to remember ritual and pop and fucking three

606
00:33:00.570 --> 00:33:02.650
refuels every three hours.
Right?
Oh my God,

607
00:33:02.660 --> 00:33:06.410
like a tweaker running around Shelvin travel books,
go down to the basement,

608
00:33:06.411 --> 00:33:11.300
pounding like I'm in fucking Oz just and then come up sweating like a

609
00:33:11.301 --> 00:33:15.200
motherfucker with a name tag on just,
and so like two weeks into it,

610
00:33:15.201 --> 00:33:18.170
my boss Duane pulls me aside and he was like,
he was like,
Hey man,

611
00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:21.260
you've been spending a lot of time in the basement.
And I was like,
Oh yeah,

612
00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:23.270
cause I gotta get travel books and that's where we keep them all down there.

613
00:33:23.271 --> 00:33:25.640
And he's like,
yeah,
do you know we have video cameras?

614
00:33:30.490 --> 00:33:32.750
And also like I didn't know that and he's like,
you're fucking fired.

615
00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:36.920
And I was like,
wow,
I did Dwayne.
I can explain it.
He goes,
no,
I can't,

616
00:33:37.010 --> 00:33:40.730
I can't have someone getting into their underwear basement working out,

617
00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:41.960
doing they should be working.

618
00:33:41.961 --> 00:33:44.990
And then coming back up and then interacting with people.

619
00:33:45.290 --> 00:33:47.930
And I was trying to be a comic,
so I was trying to think alternatively.

620
00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:50.810
And I'm on speed,
which is Kim.

621
00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:54.110
So theoretically like I would do funny shit,

622
00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:57.860
but it was crazy if you didn't know me exactly.

623
00:33:58.310 --> 00:34:01.640
Some guy told you the day we were doing a promo shoot phrase directv and I did a

624
00:34:01.641 --> 00:34:03.940
joke at the end of the day,
like it was that funny.
He goes,
Bert,

625
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:07.790
everything you do is only funny if you've spent fucking 24 hours with you.

626
00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:10.760
And so yeah.
So I got fired and then came home.

627
00:34:10.990 --> 00:34:13.410
I'll be great to have that tape if anyone at Barnes and noble.

628
00:34:13.410 --> 00:34:15.980
And so his name is Dwayne.

629
00:34:15.981 --> 00:34:19.040
I remember he asked me if I wanted to be a manager like a week before that.

630
00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:22.400
And I was like,
no.
And it was like,
what?
And I was like,
he was like,

631
00:34:22.401 --> 00:34:24.630
you don't wanna be a manager?
And I was like,
no.
He's like,
why?

632
00:34:24.770 --> 00:34:28.220
Why do you w w what do you want to do?
Then I was like,
I want to be a comedian.

633
00:34:28.940 --> 00:34:31.520
And I was like,
oh,
this isn't what I do.
And he looked at me dead in the face.

634
00:34:31.521 --> 00:34:34.700
He goes,
this is what you do.
This is who you are.
You worked at Barnes and noble.

635
00:34:34.701 --> 00:34:39.110
Don't think you're better than us.
You're not,
fuck,
I'm out of here soon.

636
00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:40.560
I didn't know I was going to get fired,
but

637
00:34:40.650 --> 00:34:44.430
<v 1>don't think you're better than us.
Yeah,
that was a,
there was a guy that I went,</v>

638
00:34:44.431 --> 00:34:46.590
I was driving limousines and had that same attitude.

639
00:34:46.890 --> 00:34:49.740
He would get pissed at me if I wanted to go home after work in eight hours.

640
00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:53.340
Cause I was like,
I'm gone man.
I gotta I gotta go,
I've got a Gig to do.

641
00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:56.550
And he was like,
Hey,
yeah,
eight hours is nothing around here,
you know,
it's a lot.

642
00:34:56.551 --> 00:35:00.840
A lot of the guys doing 12,
15 hour shifts.
I go,
okay,
good,
good for them by,

643
00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:01.793
<v 3>and they leave</v>

644
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:04.140
<v 1>and uh,
you know,
and he's like,
you know,</v>

645
00:35:04.141 --> 00:35:05.940
what makes you think that job's going to be in him?
And I go,
dude,

646
00:35:05.941 --> 00:35:08.400
I worked eight hours,
I got to go.
I've got a Gig.
Goes,
where's your Gig?

647
00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:10.980
So I told them when the Gig was,
well,
the GIG got switched.

648
00:35:10.981 --> 00:35:13.530
It was one of those things where,
you know,
like a,
it was a,
you know,

649
00:35:13.531 --> 00:35:15.090
a little hundred dollars gig or something like that.

650
00:35:15.091 --> 00:35:18.390
And one of the booking agents,
uh,
you know,
I'd called him up and he said,
hey,

651
00:35:18.391 --> 00:35:22.100
would you rather do this one in Connecticut?
It's a pays one 50.
I'm sorry.
Yeah,

652
00:35:22.101 --> 00:35:25.470
yeah,
yes.
One.
So he switched me,
you know,
and move me to this other place.

653
00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:29.250
So asshole calls the first place and I'm not there.
He goes,
yeah,

654
00:35:29.251 --> 00:35:33.900
I called that fucking job.
You went there,
you know,
you're a liar.
I'm like,
Ooh,

655
00:35:34.170 --> 00:35:38.670
it gets switched.
You fucking creepy stalker.
Like I work eight hours.

656
00:35:38.671 --> 00:35:42.320
But his whole attitude was that he wanted to keep me a driver.
Like he,

657
00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:47.380
they held me escaping.
I can feel it.
Yeah.
A lot of times.
Uh,
I mean,

658
00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:52.170
I think that,
I think that goes with everything.
I even comedy.
Yeah,
sure.

659
00:35:52.171 --> 00:35:54.870
People are haters,
man.
A lot of people it's way,

660
00:35:54.871 --> 00:35:58.320
it's way easier for them if you're a failure,
the way easier for them.

661
00:35:58.321 --> 00:35:59.920
If you're not ambitious,
if you're not there,

662
00:35:59.921 --> 00:36:03.180
like when you're a guy and this poor fuck was like,
you know,

663
00:36:03.181 --> 00:36:04.800
he's in his like late thirties,

664
00:36:04.801 --> 00:36:08.220
and he smoked cigarettes and he just looked like a broken dream.

665
00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:09.870
He had nothing going on,
you know,

666
00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:13.800
and here he is a a dispatch guy for a limousine thing in Boston where you're

667
00:36:13.801 --> 00:36:17.310
dealing with a bunch of fucking savages every day and you know,
he,

668
00:36:17.311 --> 00:36:21.330
you see someone who's 21 and it just has all these crazy ideas in their head and

669
00:36:21.331 --> 00:36:23.780
I'm going to do this,
I'm going to be a comedian.
And he's like,

670
00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:25.920
see all this energy behind this person all these years.

671
00:36:25.921 --> 00:36:29.700
You just want to squash that.
You want to throw water on that fire.
You know,

672
00:36:29.701 --> 00:36:32.100
there's a lot of people,
man,
the last thing they want to see is someone with,

673
00:36:32.101 --> 00:36:35.870
with,
with some sort of a spark inside of them.
Yeah.
You know,

674
00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:38.970
there's a lot of people,
man,
that's terrifying to them.
They just don't want,

675
00:36:38.971 --> 00:36:41.220
they don't want to see that man.
They don't want to see that.

676
00:36:41.221 --> 00:36:42.420
They didn't want you to fuck up.

677
00:36:42.421 --> 00:36:44.160
They want you to fail so they don't have to compare,

678
00:36:44.370 --> 00:36:47.760
compare themselves to you unfavorably and then start thinking about what a

679
00:36:47.761 --> 00:36:50.340
fucking disaster their life has been.

680
00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:54.490
<v 3>No,
that was everyone that worked at Barnes and noble
was broken.</v>

681
00:36:54.491 --> 00:36:57.820
There was one gay guy who had come from Iowa and just come out of the closet

682
00:36:57.821 --> 00:37:00.850
like move to New York and then I think he knew he was gay the whole time they

683
00:37:00.851 --> 00:37:02.920
got to New York and was like,
I'm fucking gay.

684
00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:05.800
I remember him coming into work one day,
he's like,
I'm gay.
And I was like,

685
00:37:05.801 --> 00:37:09.760
awesome.
And he's like,
no,
I can say it now.
I'm gay.
I and I'm so happy.

686
00:37:10.030 --> 00:37:12.490
And I was like,
wow,
you man,
hold onto it.

687
00:37:12.491 --> 00:37:16.180
For the longest time fought so much that first month,
that guy,

688
00:37:16.181 --> 00:37:17.410
he got fucked out of his loft.

689
00:37:17.411 --> 00:37:20.280
One night I came back with a black eye because he fell out a little office.

690
00:37:20.290 --> 00:37:21.850
The guy was fucking him a them amount of the law,

691
00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:26.570
this guy fuck nonstop that first.
That's,
that's so great.
Yeah.

692
00:37:26.590 --> 00:37:30.110
So he was,
he was in the closet and your sexuality like,

693
00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:33.340
like to realize you're straight and then everyone in the straight community is

694
00:37:33.341 --> 00:37:35.380
like,
let's just fuck the shit out of this guy.

695
00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:38.140
When it happens in the gay community,
straight community,

696
00:37:38.141 --> 00:37:41.020
it doesn't work that way.
They're not really into switching teams.

697
00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:45.440
<v 1>It's like you're used to play for the red sox and now you want to play with the</v>

698
00:37:45.441 --> 00:37:49.450
Yankees.
What's all that?
What about that red sox sucks tattoo you got.

699
00:37:49.650 --> 00:37:53.420
<v 3>Oh,
but yeah,
so then,
okay,
now full circle.</v>

700
00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:55.880
So then I worked at Barnes and noble.
That's who I was.

701
00:37:55.881 --> 00:37:59.990
I worked at Barnes Noble and then go to comedy clubs,
and so my dad,
after that,

702
00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:01.670
at the end of that conversation I was like,
Dad,

703
00:38:01.671 --> 00:38:04.820
I don't want to embarrass you and I want to tell me what to do.

704
00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:07.160
It was my 26th birthday while he said,

705
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:11.000
you go to the club and you tell them you want to be a comic and you do anything

706
00:38:11.001 --> 00:38:13.160
it takes to be a comic.
Can I go down to this?
Not how it works?
And he goes,

707
00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:16.070
that's humility.
That's humility.
You walk into that front door,

708
00:38:16.220 --> 00:38:18.620
you talked to the guy who runs a club and say,
you will do anything.

709
00:38:18.621 --> 00:38:21.710
Your mop up your stack chairs,
you'll flip burgers,
you'll clean dishes,

710
00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:23.550
and would have the kind of guy that cleans.
This is your task.

711
00:38:23.551 --> 00:38:26.630
What I'm fucking talking about.
Have some humility and go in and do that.

712
00:38:26.631 --> 00:38:29.930
So I went in to this guy,
Louis Shaffer.
Do you remember him?
Yeah,
the comic strip.

713
00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:34.520
The solution solution called Louis Shaffer was a gay guy that worked down in the

714
00:38:34.521 --> 00:38:39.280
village who always wear a blazer and a white shirt was safer.
What club?
Gay.

715
00:38:39.281 --> 00:38:42.400
Not Gay.
What Club of Boston?
Boston comedy club.
Right.
Okay.

716
00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:45.820
So I want it to Louis and I was like,
I want to be a comic.
And Louis was like,

717
00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:49.480
this is the night of my birthday.
And he goes,
can I give you some advice?
I said,

718
00:38:49.481 --> 00:38:49.811
yeah.
He goes,

719
00:38:49.811 --> 00:38:53.010
go back to the Tampa and learn it there and then come back to New York.

720
00:38:53.011 --> 00:38:55.570
You're in the big leagues right now.
And I was like,
that's,

721
00:38:55.630 --> 00:38:58.030
I've already got an apartment that's not going to work.
And he's like,
well,

722
00:38:58.031 --> 00:39:00.280
that's my advice.
And so I call my dad and I was like,
I want to,

723
00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:02.800
he said to move back to Tampa and my dad goes,
perfect,

724
00:39:02.860 --> 00:39:05.530
go in tonight and give them the same speech you gave him last night and say

725
00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:09.010
you're going to do this until he fucking folds and gives you a job.

726
00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:10.990
And so I was like,
all right.
So I went in that night,

727
00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:15.100
like seven said the same thing to Lewis and Lewis said,
God,
I didn't,

728
00:39:15.101 --> 00:39:17.950
I tell you to move back to Tampa.
And I was like,
I go,

729
00:39:17.951 --> 00:39:20.260
well I'm not going to do that.
I'm going to keep hounding you.
And he said,
okay,

730
00:39:20.261 --> 00:39:24.010
if you can stand out front and bring in 20 people throughout the night,

731
00:39:24.310 --> 00:39:27.940
and then if there's still people in the room after Godfrey goes on,

732
00:39:27.970 --> 00:39:30.490
I'll let you go up on stage.
And so I was like,
okay.

733
00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:35.580
So that night to the fucking three people in four people in a girl named Karen

734
00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:40.570
Berger Iin this onstage and for Puerto Rican guys who I brought in off the

735
00:39:40.571 --> 00:39:44.290
street who are like,
one guy was going to prison the next day or said,

736
00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:46.600
I just want anyone,
I brought a guy in with ice cream,

737
00:39:46.601 --> 00:39:49.570
he had his groceries and I brought him in.
I brought everyone in the club,

738
00:39:49.810 --> 00:39:54.790
they're sitting in the front row and they make Karen Berger and cry and Louis,

739
00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:58.750
they go,
look,
Karen's crying.
And so Louis goes up,
you want to be a comic?

740
00:39:58.751 --> 00:40:01.900
Now's your chance.
So he went up,
grab carrying Burger and he goes,
all right,

741
00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:05.440
you guys ready for your next comic?
And brought me on stage.
And the only thing,

742
00:40:05.441 --> 00:40:09.250
if anything that I could do was light up for Puerto Ricans and I got on stage

743
00:40:09.251 --> 00:40:13.810
and I destroyed these guys one by one by one.
And when they'd talk I was be like,

744
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:16.420
listen,
when it says in my act,
the dumb Puerto Rican and rejects,

745
00:40:16.421 --> 00:40:18.700
I'll point to you.
And He'd,
and he'd be like,
go out in the crowd.

746
00:40:18.701 --> 00:40:21.200
Was going nuts and I was late people in the crowd besides that,

747
00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:24.160
I was filling the fuck it was everyone that knew me,
I'd brought everyone in.

748
00:40:24.430 --> 00:40:28.480
It was like fucking a hundred maybe a hundred people on a Thursday night and so

749
00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:31.870
big it up and they leave the place goes nuts.

750
00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:34.930
And he's my first time age in New York and I'm like,
oh,
I'm like,

751
00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:38.500
or like on a real stage,
you know?
And I'm like,
yes,
I'm a fucking,

752
00:40:38.530 --> 00:40:41.530
and then I was supposed to do a joke and I know many jokes and I was like,

753
00:40:41.531 --> 00:40:45.970
fuck it bombed.
Got Off stage and loose is like,
you've got a job.
And I was like,

754
00:40:45.971 --> 00:40:48.250
what?
And he goes,
come here every night at seven unlocked the place,

755
00:40:48.270 --> 00:40:51.370
set the chairs up and bring in people all night long and I'll give you a spot.

756
00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:54.460
Six months later,
literally,
and this brings it to bill burr.

757
00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:58.600
Six months later I get a development deal with will Smith do work in the door

758
00:40:58.601 --> 00:41:02.110
six months later like that.
And Bill Burke told me,
it was like,
it happens.

759
00:41:02.111 --> 00:41:05.620
Don't feel guilty.
Everyone's going to dislike you.
But I was like,
Huh?

760
00:41:06.010 --> 00:41:09.900
<v 4>Did you get that?
Did you get a lot of resentment?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
a lot.</v>

761
00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:13.990
But I didn't care really.
Cause I was like,
oh fuck.
You sound like almost like,

762
00:41:13.991 --> 00:41:15.130
I mean,
I love you man.

763
00:41:15.131 --> 00:41:18.310
But you sound like almost like this hapless retard that stumbles upon success.

764
00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:23.070
I am the luckiest guy in the luckiest guy in the world.
Literally the lead.

765
00:41:23.080 --> 00:41:24.880
It's not just that.
It's your personality.

766
00:41:24.881 --> 00:41:27.950
Is it very endearing and interesting and tough.
Great Story.

767
00:41:27.951 --> 00:41:31.090
So it's not just that you're lucky it just to be you.

768
00:41:31.091 --> 00:41:35.040
And this is the same thing when you were talking about Joey to be Joey.
It's,

769
00:41:35.041 --> 00:41:38.150
it's,
you can't be Joey and market Joey.
You know what I'm saying?

770
00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:40.660
So it's like who Joey is,
Joey,
you know?

771
00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:43.310
So it's almost like somebody else has to come along and find what's,

772
00:41:43.311 --> 00:41:45.520
what's interesting about you.
Yeah.
You know,

773
00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:48.890
but the fact that you like kept going after it,
you know,

774
00:41:48.891 --> 00:41:51.860
and that you started out in New York in the village,
you know,

775
00:41:51.861 --> 00:41:53.920
it's like one of the hardest places you could ever start doing.

776
00:41:54.350 --> 00:41:57.950
<v 3>Oh yeah.
I think if you can,
I always assimilate the two.
Like,
cause I,</v>

777
00:41:57.951 --> 00:41:58.880
then I moved to La,

778
00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:04.040
so I got a TV show and then tried to do an la comedy in La and it was just

779
00:42:04.041 --> 00:42:06.740
totally different.
And I remember Bobby Kelly came out and he was like,

780
00:42:06.741 --> 00:42:09.320
I don't fucking,
I remember I was like,
I don't have this fucking witty shit.

781
00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:11.540
I don't know what he shit,
I'm fucking real.
I'm a comic.

782
00:42:11.541 --> 00:42:14.300
I'm a fucking New York comic.
I go up and I talk and he was like,

783
00:42:14.301 --> 00:42:17.600
I don't fuck this witty shit.
I remember,
I don't remember.
He just kept saying,

784
00:42:17.601 --> 00:42:20.750
fuck this witty shit.
I don't have witty shit.
I don't know.
Witty jokes.
Okay.

785
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:21.950
I don't know.
I remember,

786
00:42:21.950 --> 00:42:23.720
all I remember is sitting in the back of the Improv with them.

787
00:42:23.770 --> 00:42:26.470
<v 4>Look man,
Joey Diaz has doesn't have a witty bone in his body.</v>

788
00:42:26.471 --> 00:42:29.110
But the funniest shit I've ever heard.
But Bobby,

789
00:42:29.111 --> 00:42:30.400
yeah it doesn't have to be witty to me.

790
00:42:30.510 --> 00:42:34.710
<v 3>I consider the two difference.
I think both are like working out.</v>

791
00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:39.810
But New York is like working out in prison where you like it's just a fucking

792
00:42:39.811 --> 00:42:43.230
steel bar with two cinder blocks and you just kind of trying to get size so you

793
00:42:43.231 --> 00:42:44.820
don't get fucked in the ass in the shower.

794
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:49.960
And La is like doing like a typo or or like spin class.
So you that good.

795
00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:50.761
You want to look good,

796
00:42:50.761 --> 00:42:53.040
you want to look tight but you don't have to worry about getting fucked in the

797
00:42:53.041 --> 00:42:56.180
shower cause it's not as bad.
Of course.
I've never done it at the store.

798
00:42:56.210 --> 00:42:58.470
What la La Con,

799
00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:02.550
New York comedy is like fucking in your face like the second you stand up.

800
00:43:02.551 --> 00:43:03.840
It's not like an industry crowd.

801
00:43:03.841 --> 00:43:08.370
It's fucking a bunch of fucking Persians that are in from and from Iraq.

802
00:43:08.371 --> 00:43:10.740
And they were aware of her and then it's a fucking bunch of brothers and from

803
00:43:10.741 --> 00:43:14.760
Harlem,
some kids from Spanish Harlem.
And they just like fucking lights you up,

804
00:43:15.210 --> 00:43:17.130
but it's a little more aggressive.
La is a little more,

805
00:43:17.131 --> 00:43:19.980
you get up and I remember the first time I realized I didn't have any like joke

806
00:43:19.981 --> 00:43:24.030
jokes,
like I couldn't just start speaking like I needed to interact with someone

807
00:43:24.330 --> 00:43:27.280
because that's what you'd always do in New York.
You just,
I mean it's,

808
00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:31.770
it's your act is very organic because you talk to someone,
Hey,

809
00:43:31.771 --> 00:43:34.770
where are you from?
Or Oh,
how'd you get here?
I don't know.
It just seemed like it.

810
00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:36.690
<v 4>I never did.
Even when I was in New York,</v>

811
00:43:36.750 --> 00:43:40.260
it seemed more of he never did that when I was in New York.
I just did my act.

812
00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:42.430
Really?
Yeah.
No,
I never talked to crowd.

813
00:43:42.690 --> 00:43:44.970
The only time I'd ever talked to the crowd as if there's a problem,

814
00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.240
like you have to deal with something or if someone's just like really
outrageous.

815
00:43:48.570 --> 00:43:51.750
<v 3>I saw the guy,
what's the guys name he used to do?
Make me laugh.</v>

816
00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:53.693
<v 4>Do you remember that?</v>

817
00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:58.100
The one on comedy central Mark Laugh have no idea.

818
00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:01.810
<v 3>Was all comedy central and you'd,
Jeff Ross was always on it.</v>

819
00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:04.830
I forget the guy's name.
He dated Terra Silver Minnis guy.
Okay.
Solve,

820
00:44:04.870 --> 00:44:09.870
come to New York one day he was in La Comic and he got fucking stall like bad.

821
00:44:10.031 --> 00:44:13.780
And I'd never seen someone bomb before like that where he couldn't come back.

822
00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:17.840
It was just bits and uh,
and uh,
he would fucking eight

823
00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:20.990
<v 4>it hard to,
people are going to eat it,
they're gonna eat it everywhere.</v>

824
00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:24.230
But that was,
everyone in the club was like,
that's La comedy for you.

825
00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:26.850
It's not even,
it's probably he was uncomfortable.
Yeah.

826
00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:30.890
Probably uncomfortable and you know,
got on stage with a,
uh,
uh,

827
00:44:30.990 --> 00:44:32.250
an attitude or felt

828
00:44:32.250 --> 00:44:34.590
<v 1>weird when he got out there.
That's half of it,
man.</v>

829
00:44:34.591 --> 00:44:36.750
Half of his being comfortable wherever the fuck you are,

830
00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:40.560
which is the best thing about,
you know,
having fans that come to see you,

831
00:44:40.561 --> 00:44:44.040
having people that,
that know what you do and they're coming to see,
you know,

832
00:44:44.130 --> 00:44:47.550
I know Bert Kreischer,
he's hilarious.
I'm going to see Bert Kreischer,
you know,

833
00:44:47.551 --> 00:44:49.780
as opposed to just coming to any club.
But that's,

834
00:44:49.930 --> 00:44:53.310
that's how you develop your voice too by doing those,
those clubs.

835
00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:56.040
But then you have to always think that if you're doing these clubs and no one

836
00:44:56.041 --> 00:44:59.250
knows who you are and you're trying to get them to like you,
you know,
there's a,

837
00:44:59.251 --> 00:45:02.670
there's a danger of maybe becoming something that you're not because you want

838
00:45:02.671 --> 00:45:05.790
them to like you,
you know,
because you want to be more successful.

839
00:45:05.791 --> 00:45:09.990
I get almost like it,
it hinders your ability to become yourself onstage.

840
00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:13.500
And I'm talking about,
yeah,
I think so.
I mean,
how many guys have you seen that?

841
00:45:13.501 --> 00:45:16.560
Like do a tell when they go onstage?
A lot.
Right.

842
00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:19.230
And why are they doing it while they're doing it?
Because they know it works.

843
00:45:19.470 --> 00:45:21.510
They know it works and it's successful and it,
it,

844
00:45:21.511 --> 00:45:23.580
it gives them a charge when they're in the audience,

845
00:45:23.581 --> 00:45:28.050
like they react to his cadence and then it becomes really catchy and then you

846
00:45:28.051 --> 00:45:31.890
started to start doing it even almost subconsciously because you're just trying

847
00:45:31.891 --> 00:45:34.350
to be effective.
You know,
you just trying to be effective up there.

848
00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:37.960
<v 3>Yeah.
I used to,
I used to steal from Mattel,</v>

849
00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:41.380
but I was young because I didn't know how to write a joke and you'd just be
like,

850
00:45:41.381 --> 00:45:44.410
how the fuck would it tell?
Tell it.
Right.
I remember my first joke was a,

851
00:45:44.411 --> 00:45:47.830
you know what cops hate when you touch their faces?
And I was just like,

852
00:45:47.831 --> 00:45:51.670
that's an intel.
It's an Intel fucking set up punch.
It is.
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

853
00:45:51.671 --> 00:45:55.000
Like he said that already.
No,
no,
no,
no.
I just always thought that in my head.

854
00:45:55.050 --> 00:45:58.060
Like,
Oh,
I see what you're saying.
So it you,
you imitated him.

855
00:45:58.450 --> 00:46:00.790
I would emulate what I,
when I'd write a joke,
I'd be like,

856
00:46:00.791 --> 00:46:04.960
I got a funny premise because I was hammered on a flight to Scotland and a

857
00:46:04.961 --> 00:46:08.110
stewardess was trying to cut me off and I knew she was cutting me off and I

858
00:46:08.111 --> 00:46:09.160
didn't want her to say anything.

859
00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:11.540
And so I just went and took my fingers lives to know it.

860
00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:15.010
Like I didn't want her to cut me off.
And then I got really cut off.

861
00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:18.760
This is well before nine 11 and so I told Patrice that happened in between.

862
00:46:18.761 --> 00:46:21.820
It's like,
that's funny joke because the second you touch someone's face,

863
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:25.780
you take all their power away.
Like you touch someone's face.
It fucking just,

864
00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:27.640
and he was like,
you got to fucking tell it.

865
00:46:27.641 --> 00:46:29.970
So did you actually touch your face talking,
touch your face on it.

866
00:46:29.971 --> 00:46:34.180
I was so drunk going to Scotland from La.
Wow.
And I just want it.

867
00:46:34.181 --> 00:46:36.110
So what happened when you touched her face and she freaked out?
No,

868
00:46:36.130 --> 00:46:39.520
she just was like,
all right,
you're done.
You're done.
And then,

869
00:46:39.521 --> 00:46:41.640
and then serve me another beer at the end of the day.
Like what were,

870
00:46:41.641 --> 00:46:43.570
we were getting a land.
She gave me another one.
Really?

871
00:46:43.630 --> 00:46:48.370
I've been cut off planes a lot.
You never been cut off in a plane?
Never.
Never.

872
00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:53.040
Where's the cutoff?
I'm out.
Like with like if you've got to be a sport.
No,
no,
no,

873
00:46:53.060 --> 00:46:56.570
I'm not.
I'm the least of noxious dot.
So it's not,
it's a number.
It's four.
Yeah,

874
00:46:56.610 --> 00:46:58.510
it's four.
They won't serve you more than four drinks.

875
00:46:58.540 --> 00:47:02.230
Is that first class as well?
No,
first class.
A totally different ball.
Yeah.

876
00:47:02.231 --> 00:47:05.500
But if you put the finger,
you get control.
I'm,
I'm,
I'm a,
I'm a,

877
00:47:05.620 --> 00:47:09.640
I'm a pro at it now.
Number one,
if you're,
if you're a big drinker on plans,

878
00:47:09.641 --> 00:47:13.180
this is how I do it.
Don't speak,
ever speak,
don't speak to anyone.

879
00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:18.340
Just if you want to drink,
tap your cup.
Just Dude,
you're an alcoholic.
Okay.

880
00:47:18.341 --> 00:47:23.260
Maybe I am not talking just so that you can get more alcohol.
The on plants.

881
00:47:23.261 --> 00:47:25.570
I have a hard time flying.
I've fucking mathematics it flying.

882
00:47:25.690 --> 00:47:28.300
You see you're telling us before the show that you have anxiety right now I

883
00:47:28.301 --> 00:47:30.000
think I have horrible.
Yeah,

884
00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.970
<v 4>cause you seem a little like revved up today.</v>

885
00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:35.690
Like you're having a hard time like staying calm.
Yeah,

886
00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:39.400
because I got to go skydiving on Saturday and so that's in the back of my head,

887
00:47:39.401 --> 00:47:42.940
like the concept of,
so is that fucking with you while you're talking?

888
00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:47.640
Do you hear it in the back of your hand?
You can Skype.
No,
I know if I got,

889
00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:51.420
the bird is the only one right here.
That's not high.
So He's,

890
00:47:51.421 --> 00:47:54.730
he's not on the same frequency as Brian and I,
I would totally.

891
00:47:54.970 --> 00:47:58.090
Have you ever done skydiving?
No.
I'm not really into dying like that.

892
00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:01.810
I'm sure it'd be fun as fuck.
But you know,
there's,
um,

893
00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:06.710
I know two people that know people that have died and including Brian,
Brian's.

894
00:48:07.330 --> 00:48:11.380
Brian's dad was supposed to go skydiving with this woman and she flattened out.

895
00:48:11.800 --> 00:48:13.150
Boom,
hit the ground.

896
00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:16.900
<v 2>Another thing I heard too,
that I don't know if this is true or not.</v>

897
00:48:16.901 --> 00:48:19.510
I think we are talking about,
it's like how when you're skydiving,

898
00:48:19.540 --> 00:48:22.870
it's really hard to breathe because it's so much air.

899
00:48:22.930 --> 00:48:25.300
So the whole time you're just going like,
like,
you can't,

900
00:48:25.330 --> 00:48:29.380
you're just trying to breathe.
You're focusing so much.
I'm starting to sweat now.

901
00:48:29.410 --> 00:48:33.640
Now it's just really hard.
This guy sweating like a pig.
He's really sweating,
man.

902
00:48:33.641 --> 00:48:36.700
I'm really sweating.
It's hot in here.
Yeah.

903
00:48:37.110 --> 00:48:41.730
<v 4>Yeah.
It's not that hot in here.
You guys are both fat.
What's going on right here?</v>

904
00:48:43.330 --> 00:48:45.980
If you were in,
you really knew somebody died.
Skydiving.
Yeah.
Yeah.

905
00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:50.160
I knew someone else.
Um,
from a,
for some friends of mine in Houston,

906
00:48:50.550 --> 00:48:53.580
there was a bunch of guys at skydived and you know,
I didn't know the guy.

907
00:48:53.581 --> 00:48:58.170
He told me his friend died.
And then Brian's story,
that's to the two's enough.

908
00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:00.900
Was he tandem?
I don't know.
I don't want to happen.
I think he was solo,

909
00:49:01.330 --> 00:49:02.260
<v 2>you know,
a thousand people.</v>

910
00:49:02.261 --> 00:49:05.070
They probably died in or knew people that died in car accidents though.

911
00:49:05.071 --> 00:49:06.850
But you still drive a car.
I don't know,

912
00:49:06.851 --> 00:49:10.970
a thousand people that have died in car accidents.
I thought Jesus Christ.

913
00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:16.030
Nasscom I'm saying if you're going by like person that knows somebody that died,

914
00:49:16.090 --> 00:49:19.450
you know,
like it.
Like you have friends that know somebody at Dion's skydiving.

915
00:49:19.500 --> 00:49:21.350
<v 4>Yeah,
definitely.
And what would be the difference,
Brian?</v>

916
00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:24.620
What are you talking about?
What would be the deputy chief,

917
00:49:24.650 --> 00:49:28.410
these two guys to get to work and be,
you don't skydive.
Yeah.

918
00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:33.820
Fucking day of your life.
I mean,
I'm not not skydiving because of people dying.

919
00:49:33.821 --> 00:49:38.110
And that's the last thing,
really.
The first thing I'm thinking of.
What a fuck.

920
00:49:38.111 --> 00:49:41.950
I would feel high if I'm pulling that thing and the parachutes not coming out

921
00:49:41.951 --> 00:49:45.790
and I see that barn and I know I'm going to make a fucking Scooby doo hole

922
00:49:45.791 --> 00:49:49.690
through it.
The shape of my body with my outstretched arms.
Boom.

923
00:49:49.770 --> 00:49:54.160
I'm just going to hit the hay and I'll turn into a bag of Jello and broken
bones,

924
00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:55.480
splat,

925
00:49:56.050 --> 00:49:59.740
and basically just inside your helmet is jaw just broken?

926
00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:02.950
<v 2>That'd be fine,
but it's going to suck the the heights things.</v>

927
00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:06.810
Are you scared of heights?
Terrified of heights.
Yeah,
me too.
But you,
you,

928
00:50:06.811 --> 00:50:08.290
you've been on roller coasters step.

929
00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:10.480
You're going to be strapped into somebody else.
Also a professional.

930
00:50:10.481 --> 00:50:13.510
Professionally,
I'm going to go tell you must be.
You have to,
you can't,

931
00:50:13.570 --> 00:50:15.340
you can't just do it on your first time.

932
00:50:15.370 --> 00:50:18.750
They don't want you to panic and just to shut off.
So I've been,

933
00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:21.610
I've been sweating,
stressing about that like crazy.
That's freaking out.
Oh,

934
00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:25.030
fucking like this show is a real mindfuck for you because you have to do a lot

935
00:50:25.031 --> 00:50:28.010
of dangerous shit on this show.
We did.
We went,
we were doing a

936
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:31.370
<v 3>concrete toboggan race where you get a 300 pound concrete Toboggan,</v>

937
00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:32.720
put five kids in it,

938
00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:36.470
and then you race it down a mountain against another team who has a 500 or 300

939
00:50:36.471 --> 00:50:39.950
pound car carvery Toboggan and you go 40 miles per hour,
no steering,

940
00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:43.110
and you just fly it on a fucking mountain.
How do you stop it?
Uh,

941
00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:45.020
they have breaks.
They have breaks,

942
00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:48.140
but it depends on where your brakes are on the thing.

943
00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:53.240
You may just fucking flip it.
Oh Geez.
It depends.
The two people before us,

944
00:50:53.241 --> 00:50:58.220
the group before us,
Guy Goes,
uh,
they've ragdoll it.
They hit a berm.

945
00:50:58.280 --> 00:50:59.730
Oh two breaks.

946
00:50:59.731 --> 00:51:04.640
His girl breaks her arm in two places and all the bones in her hand and then

947
00:51:04.641 --> 00:51:07.700
they go,
are you ready?
And I was like,
what?
My camera man is like,
dude,

948
00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:12.290
a broken femur is a game changer.
It's a life changer.
Fuck yeah.
People lose,

949
00:51:12.330 --> 00:51:15.350
lose their legs sometimes cause they,
when they try to reattach it,

950
00:51:15.530 --> 00:51:16.820
but the femur back together can't do,

951
00:51:16.821 --> 00:51:19.010
you can't get a blood supply going so it gets gangrene.

952
00:51:19.130 --> 00:51:22.790
People lose their legs from Fema.
Yeah.
But yeah,
that was like one of the things,

953
00:51:22.791 --> 00:51:26.690
I mean we went shovel racing and New Mexico.
Do you know what I mean?
What's that?

954
00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:29.540
You just sit on a shovel and go down a mountain.
It's 70 miles an hour.

955
00:51:29.690 --> 00:51:30.471
Jesus Christ.

956
00:51:30.471 --> 00:51:34.430
Just sit on a shovel and then just hope you don't die and just sit back like

957
00:51:34.431 --> 00:51:35.264
this.

958
00:51:35.740 --> 00:51:40.220
I definitely didn't get 70 but guys are going 70 to 70 70 miles an hour on a

959
00:51:40.221 --> 00:51:44.300
shovel.
A shovel,
no breaks.
Are you dealing with your fucking blue slope?

960
00:51:44.690 --> 00:51:47.870
Like on a blue slip on skiing it goes blue diamonds.
It goes green,

961
00:51:47.871 --> 00:51:52.490
blue and black and want a blue one that's like been loud shaved and like salted.

962
00:51:52.770 --> 00:51:57.020
There's,
and you just are flying.
So that noise basically like the luge.
Oh it's,

963
00:51:57.170 --> 00:51:59.030
it's exactly like a luge and but,

964
00:51:59.150 --> 00:52:04.140
but with less like less control because you're on a shovel and,
and the,
the,

965
00:52:04.310 --> 00:52:06.560
the Rogers stick in between your legs.
It's been,

966
00:52:06.590 --> 00:52:09.410
I've learned a lot about myself with anxiety through this show.

967
00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:12.890
Like I've learned a ton,
but I still,
I,
I,

968
00:52:13.730 --> 00:52:15.560
I'm still dictated by my anxiety.

969
00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:20.150
Like there's certain foods I won't eat because I know it will fuck with me in

970
00:52:20.151 --> 00:52:22.490
the middle of the night.
Oh,
it just wake up and have an anxiety attack.

971
00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:26.150
There's certain foods trigger anxiety.
My stomach,
my stomach,

972
00:52:26.210 --> 00:52:28.720
it dictates my anxiety.
It's heart palpitations.
Like some,

973
00:52:28.721 --> 00:52:30.050
some foods like onions and stuff.

974
00:52:30.051 --> 00:52:33.160
I know it makes my heart beat a little crazy here and there.

975
00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:36.920
Make your heartbeat.

976
00:52:36.921 --> 00:52:40.130
We buy food like the other night when my shit was all jacked up from being in

977
00:52:40.140 --> 00:52:43.920
those.
How a peanut is a stuffed,
I can't fuck with Jalapeno.
Yeah,
it fucks.

978
00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:46.520
If fucks my stomach up,
which then fucks my heart up,

979
00:52:46.550 --> 00:52:50.900
which makes me like fucking like conscious of my heart and then I'm like

980
00:52:50.901 --> 00:52:55.640
freaking out.
Whoa.
Yeah.
You don't get any anxiety about that stuff.

981
00:52:56.040 --> 00:53:00.290
Do you,
have you ever had an anxiety attack?
No.
Never.
It's weird.
Really,

982
00:53:01.570 --> 00:53:03.050
really weird.
Here's what Liam,

983
00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:05.240
it sounds really weird to not have an anxiety attack.
No.

984
00:53:05.241 --> 00:53:09.510
I mean like most people I thought always ha.
Never like,
okay,

985
00:53:09.750 --> 00:53:12.680
this is one of the things I don't like about what you think that's true at all.

986
00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:15.110
Like you were saying,
had some,
I'll let me clarify.

987
00:53:15.170 --> 00:53:18.950
I've had some paranoid moments on weed for sure.
I've had some moments,

988
00:53:18.951 --> 00:53:20.630
but I think those are very important.

989
00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:24.020
I think those are the ones that make you reevaluate yourself that I don't like

990
00:53:24.050 --> 00:53:26.200
reevaluate those going to like know what my son I like

991
00:53:26.200 --> 00:53:29.430
<v 1>being scared as fuck with.
That's exactly because you're,
oh no,
no,
no,
no.</v>

992
00:53:29.431 --> 00:53:33.510
It's not anxiety because I'm not panicking.
I'm just terribly,
terribly,

993
00:53:33.690 --> 00:53:37.530
terribly aware of everything and it's not,
it's not a panic attack.

994
00:53:37.531 --> 00:53:39.750
It's just an acceptance of the whole picture.

995
00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:41.790
It's never where I don't feel like I'm,
I'm,

996
00:53:41.791 --> 00:53:44.640
I can handle it or I'm going to freak out and my heart's beating too fast.

997
00:53:44.970 --> 00:53:45.803
It's never that.

998
00:53:45.870 --> 00:53:50.520
It's just the humbling aware feeling and awareness of the big picture.

999
00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:54.810
You know?
I like that.
I think it's very important.

1000
00:53:54.811 --> 00:53:58.020
People take drugs to get away from that feeling on me,
man.
I go into it,

1001
00:53:58.050 --> 00:54:00.840
I run into it.
That's what the tank is.
The tank accentuates.

1002
00:54:00.841 --> 00:54:04.020
Any feeling that you get if you ever been to high in like freaked out.

1003
00:54:04.470 --> 00:54:06.440
I go in the tank when I'm too high.
One of the,

1004
00:54:06.441 --> 00:54:09.960
the higher I get like that's the more I want to get in the tank because you face

1005
00:54:09.961 --> 00:54:12.840
it and you come out of it and you always learn something.
Always.

1006
00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:15.150
I always know more about myself.

1007
00:54:15.210 --> 00:54:19.290
I always know whether I'm on the right track as far as like,
you know what it,

1008
00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:22.080
is there anything else in my subconscious?
It's fucking with me.

1009
00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:24.810
Is there anything that has bothered me?
Yeah.
Yeah,
yeah.
I go right in there man.

1010
00:54:25.270 --> 00:54:28.920
<v 3>See,
I'll obsess about anything.
If you can,
if you can give me a,</v>

1011
00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:31.510
if you can give me something,
I'll mull it over my head.

1012
00:54:31.511 --> 00:54:32.950
Like when I had to jump off the stratosphere,

1013
00:54:33.190 --> 00:54:36.400
I literally was up the night before throwing up in a bathtub.

1014
00:54:36.710 --> 00:54:39.500
<v 1>Do you feel like you're making progress with all this crazy critic?</v>

1015
00:54:39.550 --> 00:54:42.970
<v 3>Yes,
I am.
I'm definitely making progress,
but uh,</v>

1016
00:54:43.270 --> 00:54:46.930
like I'm definitely making progress.
Right.
But I,
but I still,

1017
00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:48.340
I think the stratosphere,
by the way,

1018
00:54:48.341 --> 00:54:51.190
it's going to be a lot scarier than skydiving.
Really?
Yeah.

1019
00:54:51.191 --> 00:54:54.820
Because you're going to be able to see like a kind of like a point of distance

1020
00:54:54.821 --> 00:54:59.200
or,
I mean like crazy.
Nobody's died in the stratosphere.
Skydiving is you,

1021
00:54:59.210 --> 00:55:03.190
you're so far removed from what the best I'm saying did it doesn't freak you
out.

1022
00:55:03.191 --> 00:55:05.860
Right?
No,
that makes total sense.
I mean,

1023
00:55:05.861 --> 00:55:07.920
if you're standing on top of a really tall building,

1024
00:55:07.940 --> 00:55:10.780
you can fucking see that you're really high up because you could see other

1025
00:55:10.781 --> 00:55:14.380
things at the same level or below or higher.
So it gives you more of a,

1026
00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:17.640
an idea that you're really high referenced.
Yeah.
Yeah.
When you're up it up,

1027
00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:22.120
you know,
plain,
sure it's high.
But it's also like,
almost like cartoony fake,
like,

1028
00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:22.490
yeah.

1029
00:55:22.490 --> 00:55:24.060
<v 1>If you're retarded,
I dunno man.</v>

1030
00:55:24.061 --> 00:55:28.020
To me it looks like a Goddamn plane flying 30,000 fucking feet above the earth.

1031
00:55:28.050 --> 00:55:30.990
He's just going 16 it's to take a long time to hit the ground.

1032
00:55:31.200 --> 00:55:33.960
16,000 feet hit the ground quite twice as quick.

1033
00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:35.253
<v 3>Good.</v>

1034
00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:39.400
<v 1>And it's a one of those planes that just falls from the sky every now and then</v>

1035
00:55:39.780 --> 00:55:41.140
those skydiver planes.
Wait,

1036
00:55:41.141 --> 00:55:43.960
what kind of a fucking plane can you open up a door in the middle of the flight?

1037
00:55:44.770 --> 00:55:48.700
That's a drug claim,
right?
I think you're going to be fine.
Drug planes,
man,

1038
00:55:48.701 --> 00:55:51.610
if that,
if that pilot has a mustache,
it might be screwed.

1039
00:55:51.611 --> 00:55:53.710
So drug planes crash all the time.

1040
00:55:53.711 --> 00:55:57.390
Did you ever see that one that crashed in Mexico for four tons of cocaine inside

1041
00:55:57.400 --> 00:56:01.150
of it?
They ran out of gas.
CIA plane.
Yeah.

1042
00:56:01.210 --> 00:56:03.010
It's fucking one of the greatest stories of all time.

1043
00:56:03.011 --> 00:56:06.340
CIA plane headed went to Guantanamo Bay on two separate occasions.

1044
00:56:06.730 --> 00:56:09.550
Clearly a CIA plant,
four tons of cocaine in it.

1045
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:13.840
Crashes in Mexico's Mexicans won't let them refuel cause they know what the fuck

1046
00:56:13.841 --> 00:56:14.674
they're doing.

1047
00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:16.800
<v 3>By the way,
Portland was fucking amazing.</v>

1048
00:56:16.801 --> 00:56:19.440
Have you been to Portland and Sheila who was saying that?
I want to,
I want to.

1049
00:56:19.450 --> 00:56:21.300
I'm going this year.
I just don't know.
The

1050
00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:24.070
<v 1>Portland didn't have a major comedy club for the longest time,
so</v>

1051
00:56:24.070 --> 00:56:26.080
<v 4>it was hard for comics that tore through Portland.</v>

1052
00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:29.380
But then they just put this helium place and I had done Portland before.

1053
00:56:29.381 --> 00:56:30.670
I did a theater there and it was great.

1054
00:56:31.030 --> 00:56:33.890
But this was really fun because we got to do three nights,
you know,

1055
00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:36.520
five shows over three nights.
Everything sold out way in advance.

1056
00:56:36.521 --> 00:56:38.930
It was all podcast fans,
you know.
And that's the,

1057
00:56:38.931 --> 00:56:41.620
the thing that Brian and I had been talking about it a lot lately and I was

1058
00:56:41.621 --> 00:56:44.740
talking with you about it in the kitchen.
Everything has changed.

1059
00:56:45.040 --> 00:56:47.050
It's completely different.
You know,
the,
the,

1060
00:56:47.051 --> 00:56:49.690
the people that are coming to shows are way more enthusiastic.
It's,

1061
00:56:49.740 --> 00:56:52.120
it's way different,
you know,
they know you better.
It's,
it's a,

1062
00:56:52.450 --> 00:56:53.890
it's a crazy experience,
man.
It's,

1063
00:56:53.891 --> 00:56:56.770
you feel like you have more of a chance to riff on stage and use to,

1064
00:56:57.430 --> 00:57:00.160
I don't know,
man.
I've been cutting my sets down,

1065
00:57:00.161 --> 00:57:02.230
talk an hour and 10 minutes and just

1066
00:57:04.300 --> 00:57:08.590
one podcast that re made me reevaluate everything I do on stage.

1067
00:57:08.830 --> 00:57:12.370
But 50 minutes,
someone said 50 minutes.
Jim Norton did that.

1068
00:57:12.371 --> 00:57:15.580
Norton good 50 I saw him do 50 in Austin and he made me think,

1069
00:57:15.581 --> 00:57:18.760
because I do a lot of who's doing a lot of long sets where I'd do this question

1070
00:57:18.761 --> 00:57:19.750
and answer thing at the end.

1071
00:57:20.080 --> 00:57:23.080
But the problem with a question unanswered thing is that it doesn't have the

1072
00:57:23.081 --> 00:57:24.700
same pop as the regular show.

1073
00:57:24.701 --> 00:57:27.280
And so the show always would kind of end on some weird note.

1074
00:57:27.281 --> 00:57:30.580
Like I'd be crushing for an hour and then I do this question answer thing for an

1075
00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:32.460
hour and then people would be tired.
So the,
the,

1076
00:57:32.570 --> 00:57:36.440
the experience of a show was not the same,
you know?
And I,

1077
00:57:36.450 --> 00:57:39.050
I thought it was just giving a more show.
I thought I was being more generous,

1078
00:57:39.090 --> 00:57:39.701
giving them more shell,

1079
00:57:39.701 --> 00:57:43.000
but I realized the best way to do it really is to give them an hour,

1080
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:47.060
hour and 10 Max and just smash it.
Just come out of the gates gun.
I'm,

1081
00:57:47.080 --> 00:57:48.050
and I've been doing that for like

1082
00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:51.520
<v 5>even getting standing o's,
those last,
all those shows in Portland.</v>

1083
00:57:51.550 --> 00:57:54.920
I mean instead of like,
cause I saw it too.
It kind of like a fizzle.
It was,

1084
00:57:54.921 --> 00:57:57.880
it just kind of like shows over.
Now here's this other thing.

1085
00:57:57.970 --> 00:57:59.380
And then people forgot about the show.

1086
00:57:59.381 --> 00:58:01.220
There were kind of doing this and it was just,

1087
00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:05.260
but now it's just like fucking roaring.
You know?
Those people want to come back.

1088
00:58:05.261 --> 00:58:07.690
They're telling all their friends immediately instead of going,
oh yeah,

1089
00:58:07.691 --> 00:58:08.490
it was good last night.

1090
00:58:08.490 --> 00:58:10.800
<v 4>Yeah,
they were all standing ovations.
It was,
it was awesome.</v>

1091
00:58:10.980 --> 00:58:15.060
Portland was fucking awesome.
Never had a place where people handed me more.

1092
00:58:15.061 --> 00:58:18.090
We'd never,
dude,
I stunk of lead.

1093
00:58:18.091 --> 00:58:20.450
When I got home I was wearing the same pants that I wore,
the shy,

1094
00:58:20.790 --> 00:58:23.280
the show the night before and Mrs and was like,

1095
00:58:23.281 --> 00:58:27.390
you fucking stink like weed and that is my pants.

1096
00:58:27.391 --> 00:58:30.390
I took a shower and she was like,
it's still smell in the bathroom.

1097
00:58:30.480 --> 00:58:33.030
And then she goes,
your pants.
She goes,
what did you smoke your fucking pants?

1098
00:58:33.031 --> 00:58:35.730
Like they smelled like we,
it was ridiculous.

1099
00:58:35.910 --> 00:58:38.070
It was just from people blowing weed on me and Joey.

1100
00:58:38.071 --> 00:58:39.300
And then when we're in the green room,

1101
00:58:39.750 --> 00:58:42.660
<v 5>Joe,
I remember when I kept on saying at the airport like I smell weed.</v>

1102
00:58:42.661 --> 00:58:44.550
Who was my pants?
No,
I,
it might've been that too,

1103
00:58:44.551 --> 00:58:47.520
but it's going to probably open my book bag up and there was a bowl,

1104
00:58:47.550 --> 00:58:49.650
there was a joint in a bag of weed,

1105
00:58:49.651 --> 00:58:53.700
in a secret pocket I didn't even know existed.
And I'm like,
Holy Shit,

1106
00:58:53.910 --> 00:58:54.140
I would have

1107
00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:56.830
<v 4>done,
I would pretend that I didn't know you and I would have ran the opposite</v>

1108
00:58:56.831 --> 00:58:58.710
direction.
I need to go home and see my kids do it.

1109
00:58:58.711 --> 00:59:03.060
I can't be going to court for you one time or flying to Vegas that were in my

1110
00:59:03.061 --> 00:59:06.720
car or singing in my car and we have a bag of weed and he's like,
just bring it.

1111
00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:10.170
And I go,
I don't want to because I don't want to go through security with it.

1112
00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:11.940
And he's like,
it's fucking Vegas.

1113
00:59:11.941 --> 00:59:15.180
Do you think anyone's going to check the worst of the worst?
And so I was like,

1114
00:59:15.181 --> 00:59:18.060
all right,
fuck it.
So I thought my bag,
we go to leave,

1115
00:59:18.061 --> 00:59:22.070
we start walking at the last minute,
I fucking go,
oh,
hold

1116
00:59:22.070 --> 00:59:24.200
<v 3>on.
And I,
I take it out of my bag,
I just throw it in the car and I go,</v>

1117
00:59:24.201 --> 00:59:27.320
I'm not fucking bringing it.
I'm not bringing it.
So,
but I don't tell Jay,

1118
00:59:27.321 --> 00:59:29.960
I'm just like,
fuck it.
I'll deal with it when we get to Vegas.

1119
00:59:30.290 --> 00:59:32.480
So we go through security and as we go through security,

1120
00:59:32.481 --> 00:59:33.970
they pulled me to the side and then I start,

1121
00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:36.920
we're going to need to check your bag.
And Jay thinks,
yeah,
I have it.

1122
00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:40.810
And I start laughing hysterically because I know that I know I did.

1123
00:59:40.850 --> 00:59:44.300
He thinks I have it and to,
and then the guy is a tall black guy,

1124
00:59:44.301 --> 00:59:47.060
Jay staying right there.
He goes,
what are you laughing at,
sir?
And I go,

1125
00:59:47.270 --> 00:59:50.510
I almost traveled with weed,
but I left at my car and Jay goes,

1126
00:59:50.511 --> 00:59:54.140
you didn't bring it to my car.
And the guy was like,
you,
if we,
where's your car?

1127
00:59:54.141 --> 00:59:56.810
I was like,
I'm not going to tell you you have weed.

1128
00:59:56.811 --> 01:00:00.800
Where's your car and your car?
And I was like,
yeah,
but I'm not flying.

1129
01:00:00.801 --> 01:00:03.270
What kind of a TSA bullshit fucking question.

1130
01:00:03.330 --> 01:00:06.420
That's probably going on his break soon.
Yeah.
He wanted it.

1131
01:00:06.450 --> 01:00:08.000
He wanted to scare you and to give it up.

1132
01:00:08.001 --> 01:00:11.870
The week I got walked into Braves stadium and I said to the lady,

1133
01:00:11.930 --> 01:00:13.150
just had a curiosity.
So when the,

1134
01:00:13.170 --> 01:00:16.970
it's the moment that you don't have drugs that you want to find out how it would

1135
01:00:16.971 --> 01:00:19.940
go down if they busted you.
Right.
And I said to the lady,
I said,

1136
01:00:19.970 --> 01:00:23.510
she was checking my fanny pack when I firmly believe in fanny packs.
Fuck yeah.

1137
01:00:23.511 --> 01:00:24.680
Give me some knuckles on that ship.

1138
01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:27.790
<v 4>Yeah.
Here's what was the,
I'm getting mad at all.
All of this.</v>

1139
01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:31.210
What's dead for 2011 the fanny pack will never die.
Okay.

1140
01:00:31.211 --> 01:00:35.130
Because I'm not trying to get laid.
So fuck you.
They're so convenient.

1141
01:00:35.870 --> 01:00:39.970
They're writing.
They're all your shit's right there.
Exactly.
I love wearing them.

1142
01:00:40.270 --> 01:00:42.550
I love,
I love that people think they're dorky.
It's good.

1143
01:00:42.551 --> 01:00:45.310
Especially if you're married and have kids.
It's awesome.
You have more.

1144
01:00:45.311 --> 01:00:48.310
Before I was married with kids.
Kid.
How about I never stopped wearing it.

1145
01:00:48.490 --> 01:00:51.400
How about I wore that shit in the 90s you were giving me Shit on the message

1146
01:00:51.401 --> 01:00:53.560
board in the 90s for wearing a fanny pack.

1147
01:00:55.490 --> 01:00:57.640
If you're very successful and it doesn't matter,

1148
01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:02.760
Brian [inaudible] around to stop and think about the level of pussy that you get

1149
01:01:03.581 --> 01:01:06.970
on a regular basis.
If I was really good,
still rock a fanny pack and pull it off,

1150
01:01:06.971 --> 01:01:07.840
trust me kid.

1151
01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:12.370
They would probably get you more pussy who probably get you more pussy cause

1152
01:01:12.371 --> 01:01:14.440
he's like,
this is what the fuck I carries one a fanny pack.

1153
01:01:14.830 --> 01:01:17.830
I'm going to wear pink converse.
All stars.
Two women.

1154
01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:20.530
That's one of the things that women like more than anything is a guy that can be

1155
01:01:20.531 --> 01:01:22.420
himself.
That's what you should know is what the fuck you are.

1156
01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:25.150
Instead of you going out and pretending to be some different person,

1157
01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:27.850
no matter where the fuck you go,
women know when they can count on you.

1158
01:01:28.090 --> 01:01:29.020
They know when they can count.

1159
01:01:29.140 --> 01:01:34.140
Here's Ryan's going to be silly not to exactly go fucking porn style.

1160
01:01:34.731 --> 01:01:36.700
A big,
big fucking twisty one.

1161
01:01:37.180 --> 01:01:42.090
So there's a list of just got released talking about checking you at the airport

1162
01:01:42.091 --> 01:01:43.450
cause there's,
this is amazing.

1163
01:01:43.460 --> 01:01:46.960
It's the Department of Homeland Security and they put out this,

1164
01:01:47.170 --> 01:01:50.950
the the following characteristics a qualifies a person for it to potential

1165
01:01:50.951 --> 01:01:52.090
domestic terrorists.

1166
01:01:52.270 --> 01:01:54.280
And I put this shit on my Twitter because it's so ridiculous.

1167
01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:57.460
Expressions of libertarian philosophies,

1168
01:01:57.850 --> 01:02:02.850
bumper stickers or statements like you might be a fucking po potential domestic

1169
01:02:03.521 --> 01:02:06.390
terrorists because you think that people should be able to do whatever they want

1170
01:02:06.391 --> 01:02:06.600
to do.

1171
01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:10.750
You think that Libertarian ideology is better than Republican or Democratic

1172
01:02:10.751 --> 01:02:13.630
ideology?
Amazing.
You have a bumper sticker.

1173
01:02:13.690 --> 01:02:15.550
So you might be a domestic terrorist and this is,

1174
01:02:15.610 --> 01:02:19.770
if this was just some crazy asshole,
that ransom website.
So right.
Website.

1175
01:02:19.771 --> 01:02:20.010
But this

1176
01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:22.230
<v 1>is like,
they're the like giving people instructions,</v>

1177
01:02:22.231 --> 01:02:27.060
look out for second amendment oriented views and Ra or gun club membership.

1178
01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:32.150
Jesus fucking Christ.
What?
You can't go hunting.
If you,
if you,
if you want to eat,

1179
01:02:32.151 --> 01:02:35.620
you shoot your own mean instead of getting it from some fucking slaughterhouse,

1180
01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:38.890
you're a potential domestic terrorists because you believe in the rights that
to,

1181
01:02:38.910 --> 01:02:41.670
to keep guns.
You think that adults should be able to have guns?

1182
01:02:41.671 --> 01:02:43.920
Just like adults can have fucking cars.
Okay.

1183
01:02:44.070 --> 01:02:47.390
Just like adults can have a lot of shit that can fuck you up.
All right.
Yeah.
God,

1184
01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:50.730
people should have guns.
All right.
That's why they're here.
They're here.
So a,

1185
01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:54.540
you can shoot people that are bad and B,
you can shoot animals and eat them.
Okay.

1186
01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:58.980
It's not fucking potential terrorist issue.
So say there's out argue,

1187
01:02:58.981 --> 01:03:01.500
there's no connection between people who own guns and terrorism.

1188
01:03:02.970 --> 01:03:06.590
I don't know about that.
I would say almost 100% I mean,

1189
01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:09.660
the guy's a fucking flew planes into that 11 that's just cause they couldn't get

1190
01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:12.390
guns on board.
I mean,
if you want to check guns.
Exactly.
But what's the,

1191
01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:13.433
where's the connection?

1192
01:03:13.530 --> 01:03:16.000
Where do you draw connection between someone who owns a gods?

1193
01:03:16.050 --> 01:03:19.050
The idea is that people want to overthrow the government.
You know,

1194
01:03:19.051 --> 01:03:20.640
so thinking about their drinking,

1195
01:03:21.150 --> 01:03:24.140
what they're thinking about people who rise the fuck up and realize this God

1196
01:03:24.141 --> 01:03:27.930
damn corrupt government that's running this country needs to be held accountable

1197
01:03:27.931 --> 01:03:31.890
for all their bullshit.
I finally finished watching that inside job last night.

1198
01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:34.080
Fuck,
I had to turn off the last time I watched it,

1199
01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:35.780
I watched it for an hour and I'm like,
ah,

1200
01:03:35.781 --> 01:03:38.710
I'm getting angry for no reason and I had to shut it off,
but I,

1201
01:03:38.711 --> 01:03:42.120
I finally watched it all last night.
It is maddening.

1202
01:03:42.330 --> 01:03:43.680
It's all about the financial collapse.

1203
01:03:43.681 --> 01:03:47.040
It's not inside Java a year that you think nine 11 it's not about nine 11 it's

1204
01:03:47.041 --> 01:03:51.090
all about the financial collapse and it's all interviewing all these economists

1205
01:03:51.210 --> 01:03:52.800
and all these people that didn't predict it.

1206
01:03:52.801 --> 01:03:54.660
All these people that fucking profit from it.

1207
01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:58.740
And it talks about one of the most disturbing things is how corrupt economics

1208
01:03:58.741 --> 01:04:02.400
has become the study of economics at the university level.

1209
01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:06.100
Because all these fucking guys who are teaching economics at Harvard and at

1210
01:04:06.110 --> 01:04:09.140
Columbia,
they don't wind up working for the,
the presidents.

1211
01:04:09.310 --> 01:04:11.750
They all work wind up working for governments.
And they wind up going on these,

1212
01:04:11.751 --> 01:04:15.250
speaking to Kate engagements where they're making millions of dollars and they

1213
01:04:15.270 --> 01:04:19.430
showed this like how fucked it is that everyone is just stealing and everyone's

1214
01:04:19.440 --> 01:04:21.930
getting away with it because everyone is protecting everyone.

1215
01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:25.650
Everyone is making sure that no one is held accountable for all this fucking

1216
01:04:25.651 --> 01:04:29.380
incredible movie man in Matthew,
Matt,
Matt Damon,
uh,

1217
01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:32.680
Matthew Damon is a narrator and uh,
it's,

1218
01:04:32.681 --> 01:04:34.380
it's really good if you want to get crazy,

1219
01:04:34.530 --> 01:04:39.530
go and see how fucked up this country is and how fucked up the unfixable

1220
01:04:39.841 --> 01:04:44.430
foundation of this country is.
The Financial Foundation,
this country,
it's nuts.

1221
01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:49.200
It is amazing that it works at all.
And these motherfuckers that got bonuses,

1222
01:04:49.201 --> 01:04:49.770
man,

1223
01:04:49.770 --> 01:04:54.770
just the brazen assholeishness to ask for hundreds of millions of dollars during

1224
01:04:55.921 --> 01:04:59.430
the,
in the middle of the gigantic financial collapse you are at least partially

1225
01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:03.690
responsible for.
And the fact that nobody holds them to the fire,
it's nuts,
man.

1226
01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:07.080
It is one of the nuttiest documentaries I've ever seen in my life.
Wow.

1227
01:05:07.110 --> 01:05:10.080
This guy who was running the documentary too,
he's asking some of the questions.

1228
01:05:10.081 --> 01:05:12.030
One of the guys and he catches a lot of these guys.

1229
01:05:12.031 --> 01:05:15.540
Like one of the guys that worked for rob,
for Bush in a,
you know,
he was,
uh,

1230
01:05:15.690 --> 01:05:18.710
an economic advisor for Bush.
And he's also,
he did,

1231
01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:21.460
if he believe he teaches at Harvard and they caught this guy and they were

1232
01:05:21.461 --> 01:05:23.380
talking to them and ask them a question,
and you see the,

1233
01:05:23.650 --> 01:05:26.980
the frustration when they're hitting them with logic and facts and like,

1234
01:05:26.981 --> 01:05:28.060
how could you not know?

1235
01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:31.540
And then they're hitting him with all this information about things that he said

1236
01:05:31.541 --> 01:05:33.550
and how wrong it was.
And how did you,

1237
01:05:33.551 --> 01:05:36.470
why did you think that this economy was stable?
Why did you think that,
you know,

1238
01:05:36.490 --> 01:05:40.500
these,
uh,
these,
uh,
funds should be,
you know,
rated at Aa.
Meanwhile,

1239
01:05:40.510 --> 01:05:44.260
they crashed the very next day.
I mean,
it's just nuts,
man.

1240
01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:48.940
They're just stealing.
It's,
it's incredible.
It's like everyone is stealing.

1241
01:05:48.941 --> 01:05:52.420
So it seems like they can get away with it and they can keep doing it.

1242
01:05:52.630 --> 01:05:56.290
No one's asking for anybody to be held accountable.
It's really weird,
man.

1243
01:05:56.740 --> 01:06:00.580
I mean we're in the middle of like a giant trillion dollar heist and these

1244
01:06:00.581 --> 01:06:03.530
bankers have literally ripped off everyone.
It's,

1245
01:06:03.540 --> 01:06:07.150
it's one of the most incredible things I think I've ever seen when and when it's

1246
01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:12.270
really explained in detail when they talk about it from the point of the stock

1247
01:06:12.281 --> 01:06:13.280
market and you know,

1248
01:06:13.281 --> 01:06:17.450
and w where people were banking on things to fail yet selling them and,
and,

1249
01:06:17.520 --> 01:06:21.220
and promoting them with their clients.
I mean,
wow.
It's amazing.

1250
01:06:21.221 --> 01:06:24.250
I mean you have to watch it like five or six times I think to really wrap your

1251
01:06:24.251 --> 01:06:27.000
head around how fucking complex at all is because the,

1252
01:06:27.001 --> 01:06:30.680
the whole financial system is,
it's almost intangible.
It's like it's,

1253
01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:33.960
there's nothing there.
Like as you get deeper and deeper into and try to figure,

1254
01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:38.440
you try to pick something up,
there's nothing to grab.
It's a really weird man.

1255
01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:40.660
It drives me fucking nuts.

1256
01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:43.720
<v 3>If the movies,
any indication of this conversation,</v>

1257
01:06:43.721 --> 01:06:47.490
I think I'd be lost within the five first five minutes.
Yeah,
I can.

1258
01:06:47.530 --> 01:06:52.530
I try to always have a six year olds to intelligent a tell it like a span of

1259
01:06:54.161 --> 01:06:54.994
listening to shit.

1260
01:06:55.270 --> 01:06:59.230
<v 1>I'm know,
I'm just so,
I'm just so fucking frustrated.</v>

1261
01:07:00.010 --> 01:07:00.870
Yeah,
pretty much

1262
01:07:01.110 --> 01:07:02.580
<v 3>like as a kid,
did you read?
Yeah,</v>

1263
01:07:02.730 --> 01:07:07.290
I never fucking red really never at first book I ever read was like really red,

1264
01:07:07.291 --> 01:07:12.291
like bought it for myself and said I'm going to read it was naked by a David

1265
01:07:12.890 --> 01:07:13.360
Sedaris.

1266
01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:14.370
<v 1>Well I used to read,
um,</v>

1267
01:07:14.690 --> 01:07:17.260
when I was a kid I used to read a lot of fiction and then I started doing

1268
01:07:17.261 --> 01:07:19.840
martial arts or read a lot of martial arts books,
you know,

1269
01:07:19.841 --> 01:07:22.360
really read a lot of books on strategy.
Like you know,

1270
01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:26.920
that's where I first read the book of five rings,

1271
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:30.000
which became like,
uh,
it's,
this is the tattoo that I,

1272
01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:33.400
this is me and motor Musashi fighting a tiger.
And the reason,

1273
01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:34.940
one of the reasons why I got that tattoos,

1274
01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:38.260
cause I read something when I was a little kid that really sunk into my head.

1275
01:07:38.410 --> 01:07:42.520
Once you understand the way broadly you can see it in all things is what he
said.

1276
01:07:42.521 --> 01:07:44.950
And the idea is that once you find greatness in anything,

1277
01:07:44.951 --> 01:07:47.470
whether it's painting or sculpture or music,

1278
01:07:47.471 --> 01:07:50.740
when will you find some that you just nail it?
You,
you get to the core of it,

1279
01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:54.310
you understand what,
what greatness is and you can see it in everything.

1280
01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:58.570
You could see it,
not just in your chosen field but in everything.

1281
01:07:58.571 --> 01:08:01.780
And it really is like a,
a way of,
you know,
of channeling brilliance.

1282
01:08:01.781 --> 01:08:04.360
And it made me think that as I was a kid,

1283
01:08:04.361 --> 01:08:07.000
that if I just really threw myself into martial arts,

1284
01:08:07.001 --> 01:08:10.420
I could be successful at life because even if it wasn't martial arts that I

1285
01:08:10.421 --> 01:08:14.290
wound up pursuing,
there would,
I would,
if I could get greatness,

1286
01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:16.340
if I could really figure out what greatness is with,

1287
01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:18.890
I could really understand the way really tap into it,

1288
01:08:19.070 --> 01:08:21.650
I could transfer that onto to my life,
which has actually been true,

1289
01:08:22.180 --> 01:08:25.000
<v 3>better at comedy or martial arts.
Uh,
I dunno man.</v>

1290
01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:25.360
<v 1>And,</v>

1291
01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:28.470
and I've never even thought about it that it's not even something that I would

1292
01:08:28.471 --> 01:08:29.550
think about it.
It's all you.

1293
01:08:29.551 --> 01:08:31.350
You're better at whatever you put the most attention to.

1294
01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:32.410
<v 3>No,
but good example.</v>

1295
01:08:32.690 --> 01:08:35.800
The first time like I was a big baseball player growing up and I remember

1296
01:08:35.801 --> 01:08:40.690
playing baseball with guys that went on to go pro.
I caught Brad Radke,
uh,

1297
01:08:40.691 --> 01:08:43.840
who was a pitcher for the twins and I remember playing baseball with them all

1298
01:08:43.841 --> 01:08:46.960
grown up in the way that parents looked at him playing baseball.

1299
01:08:47.170 --> 01:08:49.420
I remember thinking like,
no one looks at me like that.

1300
01:08:49.690 --> 01:08:51.640
No one is like pulling me aside.
Like,
Hey,

1301
01:08:51.641 --> 01:08:54.130
great cabernet pert like are still made all stars.

1302
01:08:54.131 --> 01:08:58.300
And I still got recruited to play like at a high school,
but I never had the,

1303
01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:02.260
I never had that it,
that.
And then the first time I did standup I was like,
okay,

1304
01:09:02.530 --> 01:09:06.340
that's the like I got that it,
this is what is the similarity

1305
01:09:06.540 --> 01:09:08.540
<v 1>for me,
it's probably just the opposite really am.</v>

1306
01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:11.670
When I first started doing comedy and I was leaving martial arts,

1307
01:09:11.671 --> 01:09:14.820
I was really good at martial arts and not good at comedy at all.

1308
01:09:15.210 --> 01:09:19.980
And I had to reinvent myself because as a,
as a martial artist,
I was,
you know,

1309
01:09:19.981 --> 01:09:23.710
for time,
Massachusetts state taekwondo champion,
I won the US Open.
I,

1310
01:09:23.711 --> 01:09:26.870
I came in second place in the u s cop to the current national champion in front

1311
01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:30.090
in the Olympics.
And I was right there and I was really young.
I was 20,

1312
01:09:30.091 --> 01:09:34.140
19 at the time.
And then 21,
uh,
I had a couple of fights.

1313
01:09:34.141 --> 01:09:36.960
I started kickboxing when I was 21.
That's what fucked up everything.

1314
01:09:37.170 --> 01:09:38.730
And that's one of the reasons why I stopped doing,

1315
01:09:39.330 --> 01:09:42.150
I stopped competing is cause I started realizing that there was a bunch of holes

1316
01:09:42.151 --> 01:09:46.290
in my martial arts game because I was just doing one style of,
of,
of martial art,

1317
01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:49.770
which was taekwondo.
And when I switched from taekwondo to boxing and kickboxing,

1318
01:09:49.800 --> 01:09:51.570
I realize he's just big holes in my game.

1319
01:09:51.810 --> 01:09:56.310
And then so then it made me not respect taekwondo as much as an individual

1320
01:09:56.311 --> 01:09:57.030
martial art.

1321
01:09:57.030 --> 01:10:00.480
And then competing in taekwondo seem sort of ridiculous to me because,

1322
01:10:00.481 --> 01:10:03.540
well now I know that,
you know,
I'm vulnerable to punches.

1323
01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:07.080
So now in my mind I would have to start kickboxing because otherwise I would be

1324
01:10:07.081 --> 01:10:08.820
practicing something that wasn't as effective.

1325
01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:10.740
So then I started kickboxing and I realized,
okay,

1326
01:10:10.741 --> 01:10:13.630
there's not even any money in this.
What the fuck am I doing here?

1327
01:10:14.070 --> 01:10:17.460
What am I going to do?
I'm going to run a kickboxing gym and you know,

1328
01:10:17.461 --> 01:10:18.720
I'm going to have brain damage.

1329
01:10:18.750 --> 01:10:20.430
I mean that I was looking at my future and I was like,

1330
01:10:20.431 --> 01:10:22.230
I figured I've got to figure out what the fuck I'm doing here.

1331
01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:25.590
I was 21 and I was,
she's doing comedy at the same time.

1332
01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:27.640
<v 3>Don't have that kind of insight at 21 keep going.</v>

1333
01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:32.960
<v 1>Well was big mostly because no one raised me left in the streets like a wolf.</v>

1334
01:10:33.271 --> 01:10:36.060
I mean,
my parents both worked and by the time you know,
they got home,

1335
01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:37.410
it was six o'clock and you know,

1336
01:10:37.411 --> 01:10:39.810
I was over at a friend's house or something and was a wild kid.

1337
01:10:39.811 --> 01:10:42.870
It was your own laundry.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Was it,
was it?
Yeah,
it was a different time,

1338
01:10:42.871 --> 01:10:45.240
man.
You know,
when I was little man,
I was like seven years old.

1339
01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:47.870
I used to do a fisherman's wharf.
I used to in San Francisco,

1340
01:10:47.880 --> 01:10:49.200
used to have my own magic show.

1341
01:10:49.410 --> 01:10:52.470
I used to walk down the street by myself with my own thing.

1342
01:10:52.471 --> 01:10:55.080
I was thinking was a seven or eight and I had like a little magic show that I

1343
01:10:55.081 --> 01:10:58.170
got for Christmas and I would put a fucking hat on and a cape and I'd set up a

1344
01:10:58.171 --> 01:11:00.960
stand that I would do a show by myself,

1345
01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:05.190
no friends and no one with me completely by myself.
This is a different world.

1346
01:11:05.191 --> 01:11:06.540
You know the people lived in back then.

1347
01:11:06.541 --> 01:11:09.510
You can't let a fucking eight year old out of the house by themselves today.

1348
01:11:09.630 --> 01:11:11.100
That kid's going to get raped and killed.

1349
01:11:11.130 --> 01:11:14.340
Too bad you didn't know little Joey Diaz at the,
I know.
I wish that for you.

1350
01:11:14.341 --> 01:11:16.740
Why you buddies?
We're going to have a fucking awesome show.

1351
01:11:17.020 --> 01:11:19.470
Joey and I would have been best friends from the moment we met.

1352
01:11:19.770 --> 01:11:21.750
I was best friends with Joey the moment I met him.

1353
01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:24.850
I would have been best friends with Joey if we met when we were six [inaudible]

1354
01:11:24.930 --> 01:11:25.763
two.

1355
01:11:26.330 --> 01:11:31.170
So I realized I thrown my whole life into martial arts from the time I was 15

1356
01:11:31.171 --> 01:11:35.550
until I was 21.
But when I was 20,
I started teaching at this place in revere.

1357
01:11:35.790 --> 01:11:40.260
There was a nautilus fitness place in revere and uh,
they had a,

1358
01:11:40.261 --> 01:11:43.320
a big extra side room.
It's really big,
nice room.

1359
01:11:43.321 --> 01:11:45.140
So we started teaching taekwondo there and her,

1360
01:11:45.210 --> 01:11:49.260
I opened my own branch of the Jay Kim Taekwondo and stood out there and that's

1361
01:11:49.261 --> 01:11:50.580
where I met this guy,
Joe Lake,

1362
01:11:50.581 --> 01:11:55.080
who was a boxing coach and he's coached up some UFC guys like Marcus Davis.

1363
01:11:55.081 --> 01:11:58.380
And he's uh,
you know,
it was really,
really good boxing coach and a great guy.

1364
01:11:58.381 --> 01:12:00.900
And it became one of my good friends and he taught me how to box.

1365
01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:04.260
And when I started boxing I started realizing like,
man,

1366
01:12:04.261 --> 01:12:08.130
I've got like all these holes in my fucking martial arts game.
Like at Taekwondo.

1367
01:12:08.131 --> 01:12:09.510
I was really good at taekwondo,

1368
01:12:09.511 --> 01:12:13.860
but you added in boxing and then eventually leg kicks.
And I'm like,
man,

1369
01:12:13.861 --> 01:12:15.600
I got a lot of fucking flaws in my game.

1370
01:12:15.780 --> 01:12:19.260
So it made me not want to ever compete in taekwondo again.

1371
01:12:19.261 --> 01:12:23.670
And then since it was so much work to do to become a competent kickboxer and

1372
01:12:23.671 --> 01:12:25.590
then it was like,
well,
what am I going to do?
Become a boxer?

1373
01:12:25.591 --> 01:12:28.680
Because if I become a boxer now,
I'm really starting almost from scratch.

1374
01:12:28.950 --> 01:12:32.460
I mean I'm a rudimentary,
almost a,
you know,
begin or boxer and then I'm going to,

1375
01:12:32.490 --> 01:12:34.720
what am I going to start fighting in that way because that's the only place I

1376
01:12:34.721 --> 01:12:37.860
can get fights because you couldn't even get boxing or kickboxing fights in

1377
01:12:37.861 --> 01:12:40.500
Massachusetts.
We had to drive to Rhode Island to fight.

1378
01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:42.330
So the last time I fought,

1379
01:12:42.331 --> 01:12:44.940
I fought three times in one day I find a kickboxing tournament.

1380
01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:49.440
I won the first fight,
I knocked the first guy out,
I beat the second guy up,

1381
01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:51.670
and then the third guy dock me out.
Third Guy,

1382
01:12:51.671 --> 01:12:55.830
it was like three fights and I was completely exhausted.
It's hours later,

1383
01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:57.820
this is all for free.
And I got it.

1384
01:12:57.830 --> 01:13:00.720
Was door won the first round and then I got clipped with a left hook and it was

1385
01:13:00.721 --> 01:13:03.570
really weird because it didn't even hurt.
It's just my legs stop working.

1386
01:13:03.870 --> 01:13:05.280
It was never happened to me before.

1387
01:13:05.281 --> 01:13:07.040
And I find is that the ones where they go like this,
they go,

1388
01:13:07.050 --> 01:13:09.600
just go rubber boy and I only,
I need to just stop working.

1389
01:13:09.810 --> 01:13:13.320
It's like he disconnected my,
my brain from my legs,

1390
01:13:13.350 --> 01:13:16.620
my legs no longer communicated with my brain.
They just shut off.

1391
01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:20.040
And I went down and I got up and then he hit me again.
I went down again,

1392
01:13:20.041 --> 01:13:22.840
I got up and they stopped the fight.
It was a,
wasn't,

1393
01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:26.370
I've been hit way harder before.
It wasn't that he just hit me perfect,

1394
01:13:26.850 --> 01:13:29.830
perfect spot.
And I was exhausted.
You know,
when you're,

1395
01:13:30.450 --> 01:13:33.200
I had shitty nutrition and I was delivering newspapers.

1396
01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:36.150
I'd get up every morning and five o'clock to deliver newspapers and then I
would,

1397
01:13:36.190 --> 01:13:39.090
you know,
take a nap and then I would drive limos and then I would go train.

1398
01:13:39.390 --> 01:13:41.070
And then I was still trying to do comedy at the same time.

1399
01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:45.010
So that made me really realize I had to pick a path and I'm like,
you know,

1400
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:48.930
this was a good wake up call for me and my ego wanted me to get back in there

1401
01:13:48.931 --> 01:13:52.320
and go smash and you know,
show that it was a bad,
you know,
that I really,

1402
01:13:52.321 --> 01:13:55.170
I didn't train ride for that fight and I was out of shape and I was sick,

1403
01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:55.831
you know.

1404
01:13:55.831 --> 01:14:00.570
But I thankfully figured out a way to shut my ego up long enough to get some

1405
01:14:00.571 --> 01:14:05.130
distance.
Your Ego's fudge goes fucked.
In what way?
It's a test to shit.

1406
01:14:05.131 --> 01:14:07.600
That doesn't matter.
Like what way?
I don't know.

1407
01:14:07.601 --> 01:14:09.930
I'm starting to see the word a little differently.
Um,

1408
01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:12.360
recently last conversation had I

1409
01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:13.241
<v 3>had said something about,</v>

1410
01:14:13.241 --> 01:14:16.210
I almost got to have a talk about almost getting into a fight with the guy or in

1411
01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:19.690
driving,
remember?
Yes.
And you were like,
that's fucking out of it.

1412
01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:21.010
The dumbest thing in the world.

1413
01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:26.680
And that to me was the first wake up call of like,
yeah,
why would I do that?

1414
01:14:26.681 --> 01:14:29.560
Like I started thinking like the guy,
Felix,
just from our conversation,

1415
01:14:29.561 --> 01:14:32.810
you started thinking about,
oh,
are you?
Yeah,
fuck him.
Actually fairly heavily.

1416
01:14:33.250 --> 01:14:35.980
You're probably one of our,
I mean this,
you wouldn't want to hear this,

1417
01:14:35.981 --> 01:14:40.570
but like probably one of the toughest guys I know.
Uh,

1418
01:14:40.630 --> 01:14:44.470
like stuff,
like no one would ever scare you or you still have people scare me,

1419
01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:48.520
but I know,
but,
but I'm constantly around.
People scare me.
But what I'm saying,

1420
01:14:48.521 --> 01:14:52.390
it's like,
and so I started like,
uh,
checking like,
okay,

1421
01:14:52.391 --> 01:14:54.690
why do you feel so confident to start fights with people?

1422
01:14:55.360 --> 01:14:57.820
And then I started and then it started like sizzling down and it was like,

1423
01:14:58.090 --> 01:15:02.790
holy shit man.
My Ego,
my ego is totally attached to,
to,
to,

1424
01:15:02.950 --> 01:15:07.240
to not like cool shit.
Like it's not,
I,
it's not attached to my,
I don't know.

1425
01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:08.970
I don't even know what an ego should be attached to.

1426
01:15:09.040 --> 01:15:12.480
Do you have parts of your personality that bother you?
Oh,

1427
01:15:13.300 --> 01:15:16.660
every part of my personality.
Okay.
Well what do you do about that?
Nothing.

1428
01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:20.470
I drink.
What did you do it?
You supposed to do something.

1429
01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:23.330
I meditate and I get in the tank.
No,
I trust the,

1430
01:15:23.331 --> 01:15:26.980
my number one thing I drink and then forget about it and then wake up and I just

1431
01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:29.980
fucking a tank man.
I think you'd really enjoy it.

1432
01:15:30.010 --> 01:15:31.210
I would want you to next to me and I'd want,

1433
01:15:31.211 --> 01:15:36.010
I've had the sense that we can talk to each other.
You can do it at my house,

1434
01:15:36.011 --> 01:15:39.220
Bro.
And I could be right outside of the tank.
There's parts of my personality.

1435
01:15:39.221 --> 01:15:42.580
I can't stand.
I,
you know what,
why don't you tell me what you know.

1436
01:15:42.670 --> 01:15:46.360
I don't like this,
but don't be sensitive.
Okay.
Well,
okay,
but listen,

1437
01:15:46.361 --> 01:15:51.070
I love you man.
You don't have to worry about,
no,
I know.
I know.
Um,
I,

1438
01:15:51.071 --> 01:15:55.360
uh,
I am,
I like,
I know that when this shit,

1439
01:15:55.361 --> 01:15:57.940
when birth conquer gets canceled,
whenever it does get canceled,

1440
01:15:58.270 --> 01:16:00.820
I will talk about it incessantly to people.

1441
01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:04.760
<v 1>No,
you want,
I will use this.
This is what you say.
You say you'll talk about it,</v>

1442
01:16:04.761 --> 01:16:08.180
which is why you'll talk about it.
But if you just say you want and just decide,

1443
01:16:08.330 --> 01:16:10.880
you know what,
when birth to conquer,
if it ever does get cancelled,

1444
01:16:10.881 --> 01:16:13.040
God forbid I'm going to move on to something else and I'm going to,

1445
01:16:13.041 --> 01:16:15.380
I'm going to push forward.
You're an entertaining guy man.

1446
01:16:15.381 --> 01:16:18.320
The world needs entertaining people part.
You don't have to worry about that.

1447
01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:22.400
Do you not like about you?
I get angry at things too easily or seriously.

1448
01:16:22.460 --> 01:16:26.360
I do that too.
Something I know about my number one,
my number one thing,

1449
01:16:26.361 --> 01:16:28.370
whether it's something someone says or something,

1450
01:16:28.371 --> 01:16:31.940
something that happens or even watching this fucking,
this documentary,

1451
01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:33.321
I get angry.

1452
01:16:33.321 --> 01:16:37.940
I was like visualizing what I wanted to do physically to each one of these cons

1453
01:16:37.941 --> 01:16:40.880
that's causing all these people who lose their houses and I'm just picturing

1454
01:16:40.881 --> 01:16:45.590
myself strangling them and just getting so enraged and it almost becomes like an

1455
01:16:45.591 --> 01:16:48.800
animal like animalistic,
primal.
It gets very,

1456
01:16:48.801 --> 01:16:51.260
it's very dangerous and that's why I was saying to you like,

1457
01:16:51.261 --> 01:16:52.160
be really careful man,

1458
01:16:52.161 --> 01:16:53.810
cause you never know who the fuck are you going to run across.

1459
01:16:54.710 --> 01:16:56.000
It's crazy as I might be.

1460
01:16:56.030 --> 01:16:58.430
I'm nothing compared to a lot of people that I've ever met.
Man,
I've,

1461
01:16:58.431 --> 01:17:02.480
I've met some really crazy motherfuckers that if you pick them,

1462
01:17:02.481 --> 01:17:05.480
you're the wrong guy and you wind up saying something to them.
They like,
oh,

1463
01:17:05.481 --> 01:17:08.690
thank you Jesus.
You've just brought me someone to kill,
you know,

1464
01:17:08.691 --> 01:17:10.820
and they'll attack you and they know how to fight too.

1465
01:17:10.821 --> 01:17:11.990
There's a lot of people like that.

1466
01:17:12.290 --> 01:17:16.070
A lot of them I've met a lot of you always been like that.
Me Anger.
Yeah.

1467
01:17:16.520 --> 01:17:20.870
Part of it is my childhood,
part of it is genetic.
I have Sicilian peasant genes.

1468
01:17:20.871 --> 01:17:23.900
I mean,
these are the reason why my hands are,
is widest cinder blocks.
You know,

1469
01:17:23.901 --> 01:17:27.230
I have the weirdest Bulger let folks,
I've got the weirdest bone structure ever.

1470
01:17:27.231 --> 01:17:29.960
I've giant hands,
you know,
they're,
they're good for hitting things.

1471
01:17:29.961 --> 01:17:32.650
I'm short and wide.
My family,
you know,

1472
01:17:33.090 --> 01:17:36.680
they grew up carrying bricks and shit,
you know,
that's what my ancestors did.

1473
01:17:37.130 --> 01:17:39.890
You know,
that,
that like that design.

1474
01:17:40.090 --> 01:17:43.910
I think there's a lot of aggression built into certain body types.

1475
01:17:43.970 --> 01:17:47.450
And I think there's,
you know,
if you look at like super athletic,
like you know,

1476
01:17:47.451 --> 01:17:50.960
you look at some fucking like,
you know some Mike Tyson looking dude,

1477
01:17:51.070 --> 01:17:53.580
like look at Mike Tyson,
just body,
you look desk.

1478
01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:56.090
God it looks like he's designed to destroy things.

1479
01:17:56.091 --> 01:17:58.700
Just designed to like when he used to step into the ring,

1480
01:17:58.850 --> 01:18:02.600
when he was in the prime of his life in the late eighties he would get into that

1481
01:18:02.601 --> 01:18:06.470
fucking ring and it was like that is the scariest human being that's ever walked

1482
01:18:06.471 --> 01:18:08.840
the face of the earth.
You couldn't imagine doing anything else.

1483
01:18:08.841 --> 01:18:11.920
That's what he was there for.
He's there just smash things.
Just the tank.
Yeah,

1484
01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:16.990
that guy guaranteed he's got a giant biological buildup of stress that he's

1485
01:18:17.070 --> 01:18:19.430
needs to blow up besides having a fucked up childhood.

1486
01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:23.390
I mean I think a lot of people that are in jail are in jail because they have

1487
01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:26.930
fucked up bodies,
man.
They have fucked up childhoods a

1488
01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.030
<v 3>interesting.
So you can almost say that the,
the body dictates a personality</v>

1489
01:18:30.190 --> 01:18:34.540
<v 1>does have some effect.
It's not a completely,
it's not a completely benign thing.</v>

1490
01:18:34.840 --> 01:18:39.160
I think without a doubt.
You look my,
I think so much clearer after I work out.

1491
01:18:39.250 --> 01:18:44.110
To me it's like mandatory.
I don't,
I don't allow myself to say,
Oh fuck,
I'm tired.

1492
01:18:44.111 --> 01:18:44.944
Let me just take a nap.

1493
01:18:44.950 --> 01:18:48.130
I don't allow that because I don't like me when I don't work out,

1494
01:18:48.250 --> 01:18:52.450
so I'm making me work out and make me work out so I can,
I can be saying like,

1495
01:18:52.451 --> 01:18:56.110
it's for me,
it's like I,
I always feel like I got this monkey and a funnel.

1496
01:18:56.111 --> 01:18:57.270
Let this monkey,
yeah,
the cage.

1497
01:18:57.271 --> 01:18:59.980
He's going to throw shit at me and he's going to fucking start rattling the
cage.

1498
01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.920
Lighting things on fire.
Just let them out of the cage.
Come on buddy.
Let's go.

1499
01:19:03.020 --> 01:19:05.050
It's the same way I feel like about my dogs.

1500
01:19:05.050 --> 01:19:07.090
Like I feel bad if I don't walk my dogs.

1501
01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:08.980
If I don't take him around the neighborhood,
let 'em go smell it.

1502
01:19:08.981 --> 01:19:10.750
I want him to get out.
Let's get out.
It's come out.

1503
01:19:11.050 --> 01:19:13.990
It's the same thing with the animal inside you.
The animal side.
You need though,

1504
01:19:13.991 --> 01:19:17.530
did that mother fucker needs to rage and if it doesn't rain starts looking for

1505
01:19:17.531 --> 01:19:20.470
opportunities to rage.
I started looking at me this dick once to get my lane.

1506
01:19:20.471 --> 01:19:23.680
Fuck you.
Fuck you bitch.
After I work out,
I'm like,
yeah,
go ahead dude.

1507
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:24.583
I'm not in a rush.

1508
01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:28.040
<v 3>I started letting people,
I thought of this the other day.</v>

1509
01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:32.600
I got flipped off by these very liberal couple,
really a very liberal couple.

1510
01:19:32.601 --> 01:19:35.810
Of course I am the stereotype of,
of ignorant white male.

1511
01:19:35.990 --> 01:19:40.940
Like I drive a fricking expedition expedition black on black,
you know,
fucking,

1512
01:19:41.100 --> 01:19:45.170
I'm just going to tap out sticker in your back.
I can get you one.
I'll put it

1513
01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:52.680
something like hip hop.
And I,
and I,

1514
01:19:52.690 --> 01:19:56.220
I guess I cut them off.
I don't even know.
And they were in a little,
uh,

1515
01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:58.320
what's the Little Prius though?
The Smart car.

1516
01:19:58.370 --> 01:20:02.480
The tiny Cooper from mini Cooper and they flicked me off and then she went up

1517
01:20:02.481 --> 01:20:06.530
and went,
ah,
like was thumbing up in me and pointing at me.

1518
01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:11.940
Oh yeah.
I don't know me or my car,
who fucking knows.
And,
uh,
and then I was,

1519
01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.540
we both got off at Laurel Canyon and we're right next to each other.

1520
01:20:15.750 --> 01:20:17.940
And I was like,
I'm gonna fucking tell him off.
And then I was like,
hold on.

1521
01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:20.550
If I tell him off,
nothing's going to come to this.

1522
01:20:20.551 --> 01:20:22.470
But if I make them feel like they won,

1523
01:20:22.650 --> 01:20:26.700
then maybe they'll continue this behavior until they run into the guy who beats

1524
01:20:26.701 --> 01:20:29.130
the living fuck out of them.
And you set a trap.

1525
01:20:29.131 --> 01:20:31.920
So I set a trap and I rolled down the window and I was like,

1526
01:20:32.400 --> 01:20:34.980
you guys let me fuck,
fuck.

1527
01:20:34.981 --> 01:20:37.990
And then they took off and they laughed and I was like,
great.
Just keep it up.

1528
01:20:39.390 --> 01:20:42.550
Keep it up.
You took a dive dive sitting going to fucking off

1529
01:20:42.750 --> 01:20:44.910
<v 4>genius.
That's,
I've never heard anyone doing that.</v>

1530
01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:49.540
<v 3>No.
Do you see,
do you sense phoniness and people right out the gate?
Oh,</v>

1531
01:20:50.310 --> 01:20:53.930
I'm so fucking good at that because you're so honest.
Aw Fuck.

1532
01:20:53.940 --> 01:20:55.440
I'm really honest with my bullshit.

1533
01:20:55.820 --> 01:20:57.930
I see shit like right out the gate and I'm like,

1534
01:20:58.030 --> 01:21:01.390
<v 4>yeah,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm super honest.
So when someone's not being honest,</v>

1535
01:21:01.391 --> 01:21:05.350
I smell it a mile away.
I smell crazy too.
Crazy and dangerous.

1536
01:21:06.650 --> 01:21:09.460
<v 3>Yeah.
My wife's best friend,
we went out to dinner with them and uh,</v>

1537
01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:11.870
when we first met him and I fuck him,
you know me,

1538
01:21:11.890 --> 01:21:14.960
I'll talk all night long and drink and we're having a good time.

1539
01:21:14.961 --> 01:21:17.480
And then we got done.
I don't fucking like them.
And she was like,

1540
01:21:17.481 --> 01:21:20.240
how can you not like them?
You just had a time ago.
She's fucking crazy.

1541
01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:24.620
She was like,
she's not crazy.
And then,
and then,
and then now I'm like Matlock.

1542
01:21:24.621 --> 01:21:24.921
I'm like,

1543
01:21:24.921 --> 01:21:28.250
if we just got to hang it on enough and then I got to just untangle the necklace

1544
01:21:28.251 --> 01:21:30.900
enough,
it just starts to fall apart.
And I'm like,

1545
01:21:31.310 --> 01:21:34.430
and then I brought it up one time about like drugs and she was like,
oh,

1546
01:21:34.730 --> 01:21:36.740
I used to have a problem with math and I was like,
failure.

1547
01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:39.390
<v 4>Dude.
That's so funny you said that.</v>

1548
01:21:39.391 --> 01:21:44.391
I had a Brian Cowen story where Brian used to always date these really fucked up

1549
01:21:44.671 --> 01:21:45.810
girls and try to fix them.

1550
01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:48.930
And Brian's been one of my best friends since [inaudible] 94 when I hosted mad

1551
01:21:48.931 --> 01:21:53.490
TV,
I met Brian and we'd like instantly became best friends when we're hanging

1552
01:21:53.491 --> 01:21:55.640
around.
The first thing I noticed when we're hanging around together,

1553
01:21:55.641 --> 01:21:58.950
it's like this motherfucker date some broken pitches.

1554
01:21:59.210 --> 01:22:02.200
I mean his current wife is a very nice person,
but his,
his,

1555
01:22:02.230 --> 01:22:06.960
he's had some disasters in his past.
He Fuck Fiona apple a no comment.

1556
01:22:07.130 --> 01:22:11.390
<v 3>Okay.
I just remember hearing something about no car comment.</v>

1557
01:22:11.420 --> 01:22:14.000
<v 4>No comment.
Um,
we are on the Internet.</v>

1558
01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:16.970
There's hundreds of thousands of people and some of them may know Fiona,

1559
01:22:17.060 --> 01:22:20.860
so probably not.
Anyway,
um,

1560
01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:25.310
he,
uh,
he just,
you know,
I used to tell him,
man,

1561
01:22:25.311 --> 01:22:28.010
you got to get better at reading people.
Like,
again,
I'm getting it.

1562
01:22:28.011 --> 01:22:30.260
I'm getting it.
I'm getting it.
I'm getting better,
man.
This new girl,

1563
01:22:30.261 --> 01:22:32.720
you're going to love her.
You're gonna love her.
So he introduces me to her,
right?

1564
01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:35.480
I say,
hi,
how are you doing?
She goes,
hi,
nice to meet Ya.
And then I go,

1565
01:22:35.481 --> 01:22:39.530
can I talk to you for a second?
I pull them outside.
I go,
listen to me,
man.

1566
01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:44.090
She is fucking crazy.
Yes,
yes,
yes.

1567
01:22:44.210 --> 01:22:48.880
I go do this bitch is fucking
no.

1568
01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:53.180
I shook the hand.
I shook her hand and I looked in their eyes and I saw madness.

1569
01:22:53.540 --> 01:22:57.710
It was like that Sam Shepard movie based on that,
uh,
in the mouth of madness.

1570
01:22:57.711 --> 01:22:59.450
Remember that?
It was like that.
I was like,
I was like,

1571
01:22:59.690 --> 01:23:02.480
this bitch is completely insane.
I was like,
so I pulled them aside and go,

1572
01:23:02.481 --> 01:23:05.360
this shouldn't me round.
I called.
That bitch is crazy.
She's a night.
No,
no.

1573
01:23:05.361 --> 01:23:06.194
She's a good girl.

1574
01:23:06.280 --> 01:23:10.000
<v 1>No,
no,
no.
Dude.
She's a fucking hammer to do.
Do,
do,
do.
You're famous.
She's nervous.</v>

1575
01:23:10.001 --> 01:23:12.100
She's meeting.
No,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
It has nothing to do with that.

1576
01:23:12.101 --> 01:23:15.430
I got that bitch is crazy,
man.
You got to trust me,
dude.
I know.
Crazy.

1577
01:23:15.450 --> 01:23:17.440
All my spider senses,
we're going off.
I go,

1578
01:23:17.441 --> 01:23:19.730
you better get the fuck away from that girl.
Trust me.
You're going to find out.

1579
01:23:19.731 --> 01:23:21.440
You're gonna to find out the hard way you need to run.

1580
01:23:21.441 --> 01:23:24.340
Like what do you track through?
But she's nice.
She's needs friends.
No,
no,
no.

1581
01:23:24.341 --> 01:23:26.980
She does not.
Does she need threats?
Fucking nut.
Okay.

1582
01:23:27.730 --> 01:23:32.650
Time goes on and eventually he finds out that she's a method,
like a massive,

1583
01:23:32.680 --> 01:23:34.330
you know,
I don't know how he missed this,

1584
01:23:34.540 --> 01:23:36.490
but like she was completely insane and I had some,

1585
01:23:36.491 --> 01:23:40.420
like some guy was looking at looking for her and you know,
anyway,

1586
01:23:40.421 --> 01:23:45.010
he winds up eventually slowly getting rid of her.
Right.
It just gets rid of her.

1587
01:23:45.011 --> 01:23:48.370
And then one day he's walking down the street.
Okay.

1588
01:23:48.670 --> 01:23:52.240
And he sees his girl walking towards him and the girls are hooker.
You know,

1589
01:23:52.241 --> 01:23:53.550
she's got a skirt on and he looks up,
me,

1590
01:23:53.560 --> 01:23:56.950
realizes it's this girl and she's got fucking scabs on her face.

1591
01:23:56.951 --> 01:24:01.600
Like she's picking her face.
Yeah.
And he goes,
uh,
how's it gone?
She goes,

1592
01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:05.620
what do you think?
Okay,

1593
01:24:05.710 --> 01:24:10.000
you take care of me.
This is all,
and I,
and I swear to God,

1594
01:24:10.030 --> 01:24:14.450
I picked this up from,
hi,
how are you?
I was like,
what?

1595
01:24:17.740 --> 01:24:20.810
All these alarms,
I'm good at that.
I can be not,
you can't,

1596
01:24:20.811 --> 01:24:22.160
you cannot always think you're good at that.

1597
01:24:22.161 --> 01:24:25.460
You always got to be open to the possibility that you haven't picked it up yet.

1598
01:24:25.910 --> 01:24:27.470
He goes gotta be open to the possibility.

1599
01:24:27.490 --> 01:24:30.080
Some people are better at covering their bullshit or they have different

1600
01:24:30.081 --> 01:24:31.790
motivations for being crazy.
You know what?

1601
01:24:31.791 --> 01:24:35.270
What is their motivator there or they're delusional.
Crazy cause delusional.

1602
01:24:35.271 --> 01:24:38.540
Crazy is pretty easy to spot because they lie to themselves or are they

1603
01:24:38.541 --> 01:24:42.440
deceptive?
Crazy.
Deceptive.
Crazy.
Strange because sometimes deceptive.
Crazy.

1604
01:24:42.650 --> 01:24:46.580
I just like a sociopathic element of it where they're not concerned about how

1605
01:24:46.581 --> 01:24:48.170
they come off so that they'll like,

1606
01:24:48.230 --> 01:24:51.530
they'll like really like play to your strengths and all of a sudden you like

1607
01:24:51.531 --> 01:24:54.620
this kind of,
it really complements me.
Wow.
We like meanwhile,

1608
01:24:54.621 --> 01:24:58.280
but he is is just a certain type of manipulative crazy that you haven't picked

1609
01:24:58.281 --> 01:25:03.160
up yet.
Oh,
I've had so many crazy people in my life.
Of course.
You're a comic man.

1610
01:25:03.550 --> 01:25:05.080
I mean dude doing just doing shows.

1611
01:25:05.081 --> 01:25:07.390
How many nutty fucking people do you mean after shows?

1612
01:25:09.620 --> 01:25:13.430
She made the greatest sounds man,
you could crack me up every time.
So listen,
man,

1613
01:25:13.431 --> 01:25:16.790
last time you were here,
there's a fucking story about the Russian mob.

1614
01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:20.510
We tease these bitches.
We let these people right now on Twitter,

1615
01:25:20.540 --> 01:25:21.770
they have been going crazy all day.

1616
01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:25.640
Do not let Bert Kreischer get out of there without the Russian mob story,
man.

1617
01:25:25.940 --> 01:25:27.170
Tell us what the fuck happened.

1618
01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:28.430
<v 3>All right,</v>

1619
01:25:28.430 --> 01:25:33.430
this is in 1993 probably I think is what I went to Russia.

1620
01:25:34.670 --> 01:25:36.260
I was taking Russian classes at Florida state.

1621
01:25:36.261 --> 01:25:41.090
I thought they were Spanish classes because I thought there has been as glasses

1622
01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:41.700
because I,

1623
01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:45.440
it was a noon class and I signed up and then I was like fucking sweet Spanish at

1624
01:25:45.441 --> 01:25:46.880
noon.
I could phone that in.

1625
01:25:46.881 --> 01:25:49.970
And then I get there and they start writing a new language,
a new alphabet.

1626
01:25:49.971 --> 01:25:53.200
And I'm like,
all right,
this clearly isn't Spanish.
So then I said,

1627
01:25:53.210 --> 01:25:56.490
I'm going to leave.
And the teacher's like,
listen,
don't leave.
Um,

1628
01:25:56.870 --> 01:26:00.110
because if you leave,
we can't have a class and I can't get my master's degree.

1629
01:26:00.260 --> 01:26:03.110
So,
but if you stick around,
I'll talk to you after the class.

1630
01:26:03.230 --> 01:26:06.710
I get done the end of the class.
She's like,
listen,
don't,
uh,
you know,

1631
01:26:06.711 --> 01:26:09.620
if you don't leave and I won't just show up at class,
I'll give you a c.

1632
01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:13.730
I was like done,
done.
So I took Russian,
I took Russian one,

1633
01:26:13.731 --> 01:26:15.360
two and three because these kids need it.

1634
01:26:15.370 --> 01:26:18.830
Another guy in the class to take these classes.
So then finally I take rush.

1635
01:26:18.831 --> 01:26:22.400
I'd take words from form and we go to Russia,
we go to Russia.
But this is Russia.

1636
01:26:22.401 --> 01:26:25.340
Like when the mob ran Russia,
like are you,

1637
01:26:25.850 --> 01:26:30.110
are you guys aware of that?
Okay.
In like the nine,
late nineties,

1638
01:26:30.111 --> 01:26:32.810
mid nineties the mob ran everything that had to do with Russia.

1639
01:26:32.990 --> 01:26:35.060
So when going over to Russia,
you had to,

1640
01:26:35.210 --> 01:26:39.830
you had to literally pay off the mob in order to go and study abroad.

1641
01:26:40.130 --> 01:26:45.130
So we paid off the mob and they gave us in return to banditos too young mobsters

1642
01:26:45.410 --> 01:26:49.400
who would go everywhere with us.
They lived in our hotel,
they stayed with us,

1643
01:26:49.401 --> 01:26:52.280
they went on tours with us.
They weren't,
they were did everything with us.

1644
01:26:52.280 --> 01:26:56.420
Their names are eager and Sasha and when we got our,
our teacher was like,
listen,

1645
01:26:56.421 --> 01:26:57.470
this is Igor and Sasha.

1646
01:26:57.560 --> 01:26:59.720
They will be ghosting us with my teacher who was there with me.

1647
01:26:59.721 --> 01:27:01.280
It was like during the fucking mob,
Igor,

1648
01:27:01.281 --> 01:27:04.520
inside you go inside and they were guy named Bruce and they were like,

1649
01:27:04.521 --> 01:27:09.260
and they were,
oh,
it gets worse.
So they like,
listen,
whatever you do to our class,

1650
01:27:09.261 --> 01:27:13.130
do not talk to them.
Do not interact with them.
Do not engage them.

1651
01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:15.350
They're only here to shadow us.
So in my head I'm like,

1652
01:27:15.351 --> 01:27:18.840
fucking get to know these guys.
Right?
Like get a bottle of vodka,

1653
01:27:18.841 --> 01:27:21.950
a six pack of Baal to go knock on their door.
No,
mind you,

1654
01:27:21.951 --> 01:27:23.180
I speak no Russian at the time,

1655
01:27:23.181 --> 01:27:25.190
no rushing because I'd never studied none of the classes.

1656
01:27:25.520 --> 01:27:28.640
So first night there and knock on Igor and Sasha's room and they're having a

1657
01:27:28.641 --> 01:27:30.860
party in there and like fucking all their friends are in their room.

1658
01:27:30.980 --> 01:27:32.690
They lived right next to me and Kendra,

1659
01:27:32.691 --> 01:27:35.960
my teacher lived across the hall from Igor,
so knock on their door.

1660
01:27:35.990 --> 01:27:39.710
Igor opens the door and he looks like a fucking thug.
He's got,

1661
01:27:39.950 --> 01:27:43.970
he's got like a wife beater on a cigarette of beer and he just looks at me in

1662
01:27:43.971 --> 01:27:48.800
Russia and just goes stall.
And now as the second he says that I start panicking.

1663
01:27:49.010 --> 01:27:52.790
All the phrases I had in my head that I was trying to say all disappear.

1664
01:27:52.791 --> 01:27:57.791
And all I say to Igor in Russian is I am the machine and what does that he say

1665
01:27:59.781 --> 01:28:03.350
that,
you know?
And so,
but I just said,
yeah going I seeing though.

1666
01:28:03.410 --> 01:28:07.240
And he went stole and now I don't know what I said.
I'm like,
did it,

1667
01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:10.250
what did I just say?
I'll fuck you up.
Like,
and I go,
I go,
I am the machine.

1668
01:28:10.250 --> 01:28:12.800
And he goes,
say it again.
I said,
I haven't let me scene.

1669
01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:14.780
And then he starts laughing and he brings me into the room and he's like,

1670
01:28:14.810 --> 01:28:17.090
hold on,
say it again.
And so I say it to the room,

1671
01:28:17.091 --> 01:28:19.280
I don't know what the fuck I'm saying.
I'm like,
I'm the machine.
And they're like,

1672
01:28:19.281 --> 01:28:21.560
you're the big,
I'm like on the machine.

1673
01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:23.210
I said that all fucking night with these guys.

1674
01:28:23.380 --> 01:28:25.940
That's the more communication we had.
As I said on the machine,

1675
01:28:26.210 --> 01:28:29.870
and Igor and Sasha and I became best friends,
right?
We did everything together.

1676
01:28:29.871 --> 01:28:32.900
If we went on a field trip,
they would tell me,
machine,

1677
01:28:32.901 --> 01:28:36.860
you don't need to go on the field trips.
Come drink with us.
So now,
uh,

1678
01:28:37.190 --> 01:28:41.210
cut to one day,
we have to take a train to Moscow.
No different mob.

1679
01:28:41.270 --> 01:28:46.060
Ran The train to Moscow and a driftwood Tro,
tro Marbury and Moscow and Igor,

1680
01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:48.800
Sasha.
We're not allowed to cross boundaries and it's all me.
They said,
listen,

1681
01:28:49.070 --> 01:28:50.690
we're not going to go with you,
but we've taken care of you.

1682
01:28:50.691 --> 01:28:55.130
We've talked to the mobsters on the train and in Moscow because we had to pay

1683
01:28:55.131 --> 01:28:57.590
them too.
They had,
they weren't allowed to come with you.

1684
01:28:57.591 --> 01:28:58.490
There weren't allowed to come with us.

1685
01:28:59.050 --> 01:29:02.320
And we're paying a different mob now to protect us on the train or pick a

1686
01:29:02.321 --> 01:29:06.030
different mob to protect us in Moscow.
Holy Shit.
So they said,

1687
01:29:06.031 --> 01:29:09.640
we've taken care of it.
Don't worry about it.
So they take me to the train.
And,
uh,

1688
01:29:10.080 --> 01:29:14.790
they introduced me to our tune.
Who?
Gangsters?
Igor and Igor.
Igor.

1689
01:29:16.670 --> 01:29:19.530
Igor.
And there's not a lot of names in Russia.
It's Alex,
Igor or Sascha.

1690
01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:24.400
What about fuel?
So,
so Igor,
Igor,
Igor said,

1691
01:29:24.401 --> 01:29:27.720
so these are yours.
This is the machine.
If you give them alcohol,

1692
01:29:27.721 --> 01:29:31.140
you'll have a great time.
So even Negro,
like through the roof,
they're like,

1693
01:29:31.170 --> 01:29:34.590
awesome,
don't worry,
we've taken care of you.
We were sitting in first class,

1694
01:29:34.650 --> 01:29:37.350
you're not sitting with your class,
you're sitting in first class to Moscow.

1695
01:29:37.590 --> 01:29:40.620
And I'm like,
Holy Shit,
this is what I'm talking about.
And I bring another guy,

1696
01:29:40.650 --> 01:29:44.520
John Bolshoi big John.
I bring him with me to go sit in first class.

1697
01:29:44.521 --> 01:29:47.400
And sure enough,
man,
we were fucking FirstClass just meet these two.

1698
01:29:47.401 --> 01:29:49.260
Igor is John the conductor?

1699
01:29:49.290 --> 01:29:53.700
I shit you not the conductor before the train takes off,
comes into the room.

1700
01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:54.750
I swear to you,

1701
01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:58.140
rips off the band on this thing says this is a present for the machine.

1702
01:29:58.530 --> 01:30:01.200
It would be an honor to do a shot with you.
And I'm like,
Whoa,

1703
01:30:01.320 --> 01:30:02.280
this is fucking right.

1704
01:30:02.281 --> 01:30:07.200
So I do a shot with its conductor and we pound this vodka within like fucking
30,

1705
01:30:07.201 --> 01:30:11.280
45 minutes.
We're done all the vodka in the room.
Whoa.
We're drinking hard.

1706
01:30:11.281 --> 01:30:14.550
And my classes all in coach and I'm sitting in first class and even or Negro or

1707
01:30:14.551 --> 01:30:16.580

And I'm like,
done.
They,

1708
01:30:16.620 --> 01:30:18.690
these guys run the fucking train.
So we get up,

1709
01:30:18.691 --> 01:30:23.580
we walk into the bar cart and a biggie or says machine,
grab a bottle of uh,

1710

1712
01:30:31.051 --> 01:30:34.290
I'm looking at,
John is standing behind me.
He's like,
Eh,

And he's like,

1714
01:30:37.591 --> 01:30:41.900
And I go,

I look around and were robbing the bar cart.

1715
01:30:41.910 --> 01:30:43.710
the bartender standing like this.

1716
01:30:43.740 --> 01:30:46.860
Everyone's standing against the wall and I'm sitting behind the bar with a

1717
01:30:46.861 --> 01:30:50.490
handful of rubles,
a bottle of vodka and a thing of bread going,
holy fuck.

1718
01:30:50.790 --> 01:30:52.680
John looks at me.
And he's like,
just take it,

1719
01:30:52.681 --> 01:30:55.930
let's go take all the fucking cash out of the bar cart,

1720
01:30:57.210 --> 01:31:00.150
not making eye contact every,
and they're papillon just lets it happen.

1721
01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:03.780
It's the mob.
They ran everything in Russia,
everything.
Wow.

1722
01:31:03.810 --> 01:31:07.350
And so we get done and we'd go back to our room and it's a totally different

1723
01:31:07.351 --> 01:31:12.030
energy,
like very like very sketchy,
you know.
And he freaked out.

1724
01:31:12.031 --> 01:31:13.440
Now I'm free talks.
I'm like,
fuck,

1725
01:31:13.470 --> 01:31:15.450
I just robbed the car like no one else saw anyone rubbed.

1726
01:31:15.451 --> 01:31:17.910
The bark are except for me.
And my teacher,
Val,

1727
01:31:17.940 --> 01:31:20.490
who's at the time was our chaperone,
didn't speak any Russian.

1728
01:31:20.491 --> 01:31:23.820
She comes to our first class cart,
opens the door and says,

1729
01:31:23.821 --> 01:31:27.060
I need to talk to you right now.
And I was like,
listen.
And she goes,

1730
01:31:27.061 --> 01:31:30.180
I told you that you're in big trouble.
You I my classmate,

1731
01:31:30.181 --> 01:31:32.760
your classmates that told me what happened.
Big Ego.
It takes a sip of vodka,

1732
01:31:32.761 --> 01:31:36.900
spits in her eyes and goes,
no one talks to the machine like that.
I'm like,
whoa.

1733
01:31:36.901 --> 01:31:38.920
He spit vodka in her eyes,

1734
01:31:38.970 --> 01:31:43.230
fucking it is and then shuts the door.
And then it looks at me and he says,

1735
01:31:43.231 --> 01:31:47.400
don't worry,
I got you.
When it gets dark,
we're going to have a lot of fun.

1736
01:31:47.460 --> 01:31:50.810
And he pulls out a thing,
a keys.
He's got keys to the whole fucking train.

1737
01:31:50.830 --> 01:31:54.450
He's like,
we're going to rob everyone when the,
when it gets dark now I'm like,

1738
01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:58.620
fuck,
why did I get myself into like,
this is bad news,
bad fucking news.

1739
01:31:58.621 --> 01:32:02.170
So we get stark and sure enough,
then we start robbing the train,

1740
01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:04.840
go through my class first and we'd fucking open the door.

1741
01:32:04.910 --> 01:32:06.730
Little legal would crawl in,
pull the bags out.

1742
01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:09.760
John and I would go through them and try not to steal like anything important

1743
01:32:09.970 --> 01:32:12.430
and Biggie or would stand guard.
And if anyone woke up,

1744
01:32:12.690 --> 01:32:16.990
I mean take us civil vodka and spit it in their face.
And it was,
I mean,

1745
01:32:16.991 --> 01:32:20.740
it's sketchy now.
It's sketchy.
It's not even fun.
These guys aren't fucking,
no,
no,

1746
01:32:20.741 --> 01:32:24.070
no.
They're loaded though.
They're hammered.
Piss drunk.
We robbed my whole class.

1747
01:32:24.130 --> 01:32:28.420
And then,
uh,
and then we end up,
they end up taking off and going into the car.

1748
01:32:28.421 --> 01:32:31.120
And me and John were sitting in,
in the first class,
courteous thing thinking,

1749
01:32:31.121 --> 01:32:32.980
we're fucked,
man.
We're fucked.
We robbed the train.

1750
01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:36.250
We probed the bar cart and they'd come back and they're just fucking angry,

1751
01:32:36.251 --> 01:32:40.870
drunk,
like Piss,
angry drunk.
We pull into Moscow and my teacher,
Val,
uh,

1752
01:32:40.900 --> 01:32:43.200
comes to the door,
opens it and said,
I'm just letting you know,

1753
01:32:43.220 --> 01:32:48.100
we've called the police.
So I was like,
fuck.
So Igor,
Igor,
Igor,
like,
fuck it.

1754
01:32:48.101 --> 01:32:50.170
Don't worry.
Fuck the police.
Fuck the police.
This is Russia.

1755
01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:53.050
Who the fuck she thinks she is?
This isn't America.
This is Russia.

1756
01:32:53.140 --> 01:32:58.000
We run everything.
I'm like,
Ugh,
I'm going to fucking go to the gulag.
Sure enough.

1757
01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:01.870
Sure enough,
man,
the cops are sitting on the,
on the middle,

1758
01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:05.590
like the middle,
you know,
were people get off the train,

1759
01:33:05.591 --> 01:33:07.750
that little receiving area.
My class is sitting there,

1760
01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:09.760
my whole class or in the pajamas,
they're crying.

1761
01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:13.630
Their bags had been gone through their fucking giving statements to the cops and

1762
01:33:13.631 --> 01:33:17.140
the cops are writing them down and I'm sitting with Igor and eager and John in

1763
01:33:17.141 --> 01:33:19.540
the fucking car and they're just still drinking.
And smoking and they're like,

1764
01:33:19.541 --> 01:33:20.470
fuck this,
fuck,

1765
01:33:20.471 --> 01:33:24.490
this will take you there of this right now they walk outside out to the cops and

1766
01:33:24.491 --> 01:33:26.470
start yelling at the cops and I'm like,
mother Fucker,

1767
01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:29.180
this is not how I would have taken care of this.
I don't know.

1768
01:33:29.200 --> 01:33:30.160
I don't even know what they're saying.

1769
01:33:30.161 --> 01:33:32.950
But they're just shouting and the cops are shouting back and then finally biggie

1770
01:33:32.951 --> 01:33:34.750
or just starts pointing at me and I'm like,
oh,

1771
01:33:34.751 --> 01:33:36.310
he's been in this whole fucking thing on me.

1772
01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:38.530
Like I'm going down for the whole thing.

1773
01:33:38.740 --> 01:33:41.500
And then the cop starts pointing at me and telling me exists as it.
Yeah,

1774
01:33:41.501 --> 01:33:43.660
it's by the owner or whatever he's saying,
come here right now.

1775
01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:48.400
So I fucking walk out.
And it's that moment where you find the hash on your body,

1776
01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:50.560
you know they find it and you're going to jail forever.

1777
01:33:50.590 --> 01:33:54.110
Is that that moment that walk we were asshole gets cold and you're like,
this is,

1778
01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:56.590
it is an express fucking that's the moment.

1779
01:33:56.890 --> 01:34:00.430
And I walk all the way across this little fucking trail to get to him.

1780
01:34:00.431 --> 01:34:03.610
I get right up to the cop and the cop looks at me and he goes,

1781
01:34:04.210 --> 01:34:07.420
I understand you're the machine.
And I was like,
yeah,
and he goes,
tonight,

1782
01:34:07.421 --> 01:34:11.470
you party with us.
So then we went out and partied with these cops.

1783
01:34:11.530 --> 01:34:13.630
So the cops did nothing.
Fucking nothing.

1784
01:34:13.660 --> 01:34:16.720
They were so excited to meet the machine.
What?
They were like this fucking,

1785
01:34:16.721 --> 01:34:21.460
it was the,
it was,
it was,
it has,
it was a nickname.
No one funny in Russia.

1786
01:34:21.461 --> 01:34:25.900
Is that what it is?
No,
there was no,
there was no humor.
There was no with you.

1787
01:34:26.140 --> 01:34:27.910
Is that what it is?
Is this and no one funny.

1788
01:34:27.911 --> 01:34:29.950
And then you come along and you're hilarious.
So they're like,

1789
01:34:29.951 --> 01:34:32.140
we're partying with you.
Yeah.
And I was,
and I was just loud,

1790
01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:33.700
like there's not a lot of loud people like you.

1791
01:34:33.701 --> 01:34:38.610
Would you be willing to move to Russia to be their bitch and do like,
Nah,
dude,

1792
01:34:38.611 --> 01:34:42.490
those guys scared me one night,
the guy,
did you party with these guys?
Oh,

1793
01:34:42.600 --> 01:34:44.680
I partied with eagle or you were on the train only.

1794
01:34:44.710 --> 01:34:49.420
And then I partied with the cops in Moscow with John and then for one night and

1795
01:34:49.421 --> 01:34:53.500
then we hid from them cause they want it.
They like the cops one.
Uh,
no,

1796
01:34:53.501 --> 01:34:57.080
the cops were skipped were scary.
More scary than the gangsters because they,
you,

1797
01:34:57.110 --> 01:34:58.220
they could not get in trouble.

1798
01:34:59.150 --> 01:35:01.100
Like they either were like crying my cop car and you're like,

1799
01:35:01.101 --> 01:35:05.060
what the fuck drive my comp costs.
Fucking do they drive on the left side,

1800
01:35:05.090 --> 01:35:10.010
the right side,
same side as us.
I don't remember.
I was there for three months.

1801
01:35:10.011 --> 01:35:14.170
You'd think I'd know.
I have no idea.
I was drunk on the same side as us.
But they,

1802
01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:18.860
but they,
I mean like the whole experience in Russia was just,
it was just,

1803
01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:21.200
I remember one time we,
Igor and eat,
you're going to,

1804
01:35:21.201 --> 01:35:25.670
Sasha had said they were going to get a boat for us for Russian May Day or Labor

1805
01:35:25.670 --> 01:35:27.430
Day and they're like,
yeah,
we got to,
um,

1806
01:35:28.970 --> 01:35:30.770
they're going to have a big boat for our whole class.

1807
01:35:30.770 --> 01:35:33.380
We're all going out in the boat.
So I get up early for the day,

1808
01:35:33.381 --> 01:35:36.500
we're going out the boat and I go over to Igor his room and Igor is eating dried

1809
01:35:36.501 --> 01:35:40.490
fish,
drinking beers.
And I was like,
what's matter?
And he's like,
I'm fucked.
I go,

1810
01:35:40.491 --> 01:35:42.780
what?
And he goes,
we got no boat.
Like,
what do you mean?
He goes,
I've,

1811
01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:45.200
I've tried everything to try to get a boat.
I can't get a fucking boat.

1812
01:35:45.380 --> 01:35:49.130
And we've promised the class of boat for the tour is supposed to have a boat.

1813
01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:50.840
And so we're like,
oh fuck.
And he goes,

1814
01:35:50.841 --> 01:35:54.680
and then all the sudden the phone rings and he goes,
we got a boat.
I go,
we do.

1815
01:35:54.710 --> 01:35:57.260
And he goes,
yeah.
So we start walking to the dock,

1816
01:35:57.320 --> 01:35:58.850
we're carrying a fucking big case of beer,

1817
01:35:58.851 --> 01:36:03.080
my whole class cameras and fucking little passports around their neck.

1818
01:36:03.110 --> 01:36:06.410
And one of his buddies just walks up and he's like,
hey.
And he's like,
hey.

1819
01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:09.920
And then we just get to the dock and there's a boat there and we just get on it

1820
01:36:09.921 --> 01:36:13.370
and take off.
And halfway through we realize like,
I just stole the fucking boat.

1821
01:36:14.030 --> 01:36:18.500
He just stole the boat and he was like,
Russia must be just fucking crazy.

1822
01:36:18.501 --> 01:36:20.060
Insane.
We went to,

1823
01:36:20.110 --> 01:36:24.710
went to a big mob boss party one night and he was like,
tells them my boss.

1824
01:36:24.711 --> 01:36:27.100
He goes,
this is the machine.
This is the guy I was telling about.

1825
01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:29.330
How does this all happen?
It just was loud and then,

1826
01:36:29.331 --> 01:36:34.040
and then I was partying with Eagle and Sasha so much that like that.

1827
01:36:34.041 --> 01:36:36.350
And they just tell their friends,
oh,
you gotta meet this guy,

1828
01:36:36.410 --> 01:36:37.940
you gotta meet this guy.
He's so funny.

1829
01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:40.640
We're going to have to drink with you and then moved it down.

1830
01:36:40.640 --> 01:36:43.190
We're going to do shots with [inaudible].
You gotta be careful,
man.

1831
01:36:43.600 --> 01:36:47.970
You were selling yourself as this incredible fun party guy and everyone's going

1832
01:36:47.971 --> 01:36:50.300
to want to do shots with you.
Oh,
I don't.
I'm,
I'm fucking,

1833
01:36:50.690 --> 01:36:52.450
are you friends with Igor on Facebook now?
Have these.

1834
01:36:52.460 --> 01:36:55.540
I tried to find them and I'm thinking,
where are you on Twitter?

1835
01:36:55.610 --> 01:36:58.340
I think ego wanting to be a filmmaker.
Really bad.

1836
01:36:58.670 --> 01:37:01.400
Like he really wanted to be a filmmaker and he talked about film and what kind

1837
01:37:01.401 --> 01:37:05.180
of film.
I have no fire.
I was 22 at the time.

1838
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:09.260
Igor was ego is probably dead.
I would say you,

1839
01:37:09.340 --> 01:37:12.410
you had a pretty interesting life before you ever became a comedian.

1840
01:37:12.411 --> 01:37:15.320
You would think you have a wealth to fucking stuff to talk about on stage.

1841
01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:18.110
Did you ever figure out a way to tell that mobster story on stage?

1842
01:37:18.140 --> 01:37:21.500
I can't because it's too long.
It's too like it's,
I can tell you here,

1843
01:37:21.620 --> 01:37:25.610
but it to tell it to chop it up.
It's hard.
It's really hard.

1844
01:37:25.790 --> 01:37:29.970
It's like the Tracy Morgan Story.
I can't,
I never felt comfortable telling them.

1845
01:37:29.980 --> 01:37:30.591
That's ridiculous.

1846
01:37:30.591 --> 01:37:32.860
Well there's a perfect example cause look Jay was telling them on stage and it

1847
01:37:32.861 --> 01:37:33.940
was crushing.
Yeah,
I know.

1848
01:37:34.130 --> 01:37:36.980
Totally tell that onstage and maybe I'll have him tell the machine story and

1849
01:37:36.981 --> 01:37:41.930
then tighten it back from him.
Tighten it up.

1850
01:37:42.260 --> 01:37:44.900
Yeah,
just it just farm it out to other like,
you know,

1851
01:37:44.901 --> 01:37:48.530
if there is some Mexican comics in town,
sort of like Sarah get jokes.

1852
01:37:48.830 --> 01:37:53.000
You can have them carry your joke for you and to term.
But yeah,

1853
01:37:53.001 --> 01:37:56.130
so I don't,
I don't,
I don't,
I don't party like that really anymore.

1854
01:37:56.190 --> 01:37:58.920
<v 4>[inaudible] telling us how much hammered to get lately because you're trying to</v>

1855
01:37:58.921 --> 01:38:02.220
avoid this plane's.
Yeah,
that's fucking anxiety.

1856
01:38:02.250 --> 01:38:06.540
That's me trying to handle whatever I've done to my brain so that I can get from

1857
01:38:06.570 --> 01:38:08.790
fucking La to New York.
Do you feel like you're,

1858
01:38:08.970 --> 01:38:12.630
some guys don't want to lose that anxiety because they're worried that if they

1859
01:38:12.631 --> 01:38:16.920
become evolved some whatever,
you know enlightened,

1860
01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:19.980
however you want to say that there wouldn't be funny anymore.
Yeah.
I'm afraid.

1861
01:38:20.310 --> 01:38:23.940
Whatever I get nervous is shipped.
Fargo stays still.
I used to think that a,

1862
01:38:23.941 --> 01:38:26.130
if I became more enlightened I wouldn't be funny.

1863
01:38:26.131 --> 01:38:29.670
I would avoid like doing yoga and I would avoid meditating because I literally

1864
01:38:29.671 --> 01:38:32.940
thought I had to be more fucked up to be funny.
I feel that way.

1865
01:38:33.150 --> 01:38:36.210
Like they asked me to get on this drug called Selectsa.
For what?

1866
01:38:36.211 --> 01:38:40.470
What does that do?
Share social anxiety disorder,
let's say.
So Alexa,

1867
01:38:40.471 --> 01:38:43.590
how you spell it?
S.
A.
Clec.

1868
01:38:44.720 --> 01:38:49.440
C.
E.
L.
E.
X.
A.
A.
No,
I want to say it's an S.
I got a prescription for it,

1869
01:38:49.441 --> 01:38:50.820
but I used to treat depression,

1870
01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:55.860
class of antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,

1871
01:38:55.890 --> 01:38:59.490
and it works.
It increasing the amount of Serotonin,
a natural substance.
You know,

1872
01:38:59.760 --> 01:39:02.760
my thing with all this stuff is first get your body in order.

1873
01:39:03.450 --> 01:39:06.420
This is what I tell everybody whenever I talked to anybody and they're like,
oh,

1874
01:39:06.421 --> 01:39:07.940
I'm thinking about getting on something.

1875
01:39:08.130 --> 01:39:12.450
I'm not completely opposed to people doing any,
any sort of antidepressant.

1876
01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:14.580
I know people that's changed their fucking life.

1877
01:39:14.581 --> 01:39:17.040
I know people where it's helped them dramatically.
You know,

1878
01:39:17.110 --> 01:39:19.080
including one buddy of mine who got on it,

1879
01:39:19.081 --> 01:39:22.350
changes life and then slowly weaned himself off of it and literally has a

1880
01:39:22.351 --> 01:39:24.720
different way of thinking now.
And it saved him.
Yeah,

1881
01:39:24.721 --> 01:39:28.050
he was really super depressed.
He had some real issues.
You know,
how much,

1882
01:39:28.140 --> 01:39:31.440
how much of it was his childhood,
how much of it it was,
as you know,
biology,

1883
01:39:31.480 --> 01:39:32.313
whatever the fuck it is.

1884
01:39:32.970 --> 01:39:36.540
But I think you got to get your body in order before you start fucking around

1885
01:39:36.541 --> 01:39:38.330
with all that stuff.
My body's a wreck.
Yeah.

1886
01:39:38.340 --> 01:39:40.910
Well of course it's not working so good then.
Yeah.

1887
01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:44.700
So it's how often you work out.
Ah,

1888
01:39:45.420 --> 01:39:50.070
do you want to be healthy?
I mean,
what advice do you want advice?

1889
01:39:50.310 --> 01:39:53.820
Why don't you,
uh,
join some sort of a,
a gym,
get,
get some sort of a trainer.

1890
01:39:54.580 --> 01:39:56.520
That's when's that ever going to have?
Okay.
How about this?

1891
01:39:56.521 --> 01:40:00.270
Bring a DVD on the road with you.
I have DVDs that are all body weight exercises.

1892
01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:02.160
You can do it in your hotel room.

1893
01:40:02.161 --> 01:40:04.980
You set a laptop down on the bed and right in front of the bed you need a

1894
01:40:04.981 --> 01:40:09.240
fucking small space.
You start doing Hindu squats and Hindu pushups and you know,

1895
01:40:09.300 --> 01:40:12.810
shake weight and uh,
you know,
pushups with claps in between them.

1896
01:40:12.811 --> 01:40:14.970
And then you could do handstands against the wall.
Dude,

1897
01:40:14.971 --> 01:40:16.410
you can have a serious fucking workout.

1898
01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:21.320
Steve Maxwell told me how to do chin ups on a adore.
You,
uh,
you,

1899
01:40:21.321 --> 01:40:24.030
you put a towel inside the door,
slam it shut.

1900
01:40:24.031 --> 01:40:27.420
So there's a knot in the towel and then not stays like so that you know you can,

1901
01:40:27.660 --> 01:40:32.010
you can slam the door shut and you can have it like,
so you can't pull the towel.

1902
01:40:32.011 --> 01:40:33.510
Thrilled.
And then you do chin ups with it.

1903
01:40:33.780 --> 01:40:36.120
I do all kinds of crazy shit in my hotel room.
Yeah,

1904
01:40:36.130 --> 01:40:38.790
I'm sure that's one of the things I need to do.
Uh,

1905
01:40:38.850 --> 01:40:40.320
but before you start taking any crazy,

1906
01:40:40.330 --> 01:40:45.150
and they just said that's what you should be on.
Who says this fucking doctor?

1907
01:40:45.151 --> 01:40:48.300
I went to a therapist once and she was like,
you need to talk to,
cause I,

1908
01:40:48.301 --> 01:40:48.670
you know,

1909
01:40:48.670 --> 01:40:51.600
I have probably fly and I've always had a problem with falling and a flight

1910
01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:53.770
200,000 miles a year,
but I still

1911
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:56.290
<v 2>have anxiety when I get on a plane.
I can't get rid of it.</v>

1912
01:40:56.291 --> 01:41:00.470
I just hasn't disappeared until they're like,
Yo,
it's,
you need to get on select,

1913
01:41:00.471 --> 01:41:04.570
sir.
You also have a social anxiety disorder.
And I'm like,
oh,
fuck it.

1914
01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:06.630
I can talk to people all day long.
Yeah.

1915
01:41:06.730 --> 01:41:10.330
That's ridiculous that anyone would say that you have a social anxiety disorder.

1916
01:41:10.630 --> 01:41:13.450
You're a fucking comedian,
but yeah,
but,
but it's,
I don't know.

1917
01:41:13.451 --> 01:41:16.180
So I'm sure there's a ton of things I need to do to fix my,

1918
01:41:16.181 --> 01:41:18.810
everyone has a little bit of social anxiety just cause you don't know.

1919
01:41:18.850 --> 01:41:20.260
I mean when you first talked to someone,

1920
01:41:20.261 --> 01:41:21.490
you don't know what the fuck you getting.

1921
01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:24.220
I you get better at it and more used to it as you get older.

1922
01:41:24.221 --> 01:41:26.920
But I used to remember I used to go to banks and uh,

1923
01:41:26.980 --> 01:41:29.700
so I had already started doing comedy at the time and uh,

1924
01:41:29.701 --> 01:41:33.300
I would fucking have weird almost um,
like,

1925
01:41:33.540 --> 01:41:36.940
like failures of my speech when I was talked to someone at the bank.

1926
01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:42.220
You know what I mean?
I'd get up to the counter.
Can I help you sir?
As a,

1927
01:41:42.230 --> 01:41:44.680
um,
yeah,
cause I need to,

1928
01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:49.330
I'd need to did Dodd deposit positives.
Like it was just like,

1929
01:41:49.830 --> 01:41:52.860
it just couldn't come out.
Right.
I was nervous for whatever stupid reason.
I mean,

1930
01:41:53.170 --> 01:41:56.770
I had fought,
I had done stand up,
I'd done all these scary,
scary things,

1931
01:41:56.771 --> 01:42:00.880
but talking to the teller for whatever reason,
you know,
it would make me walk up,

1932
01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:03.810
you know?
So I think we all have a certain amount of social anxiety.

1933
01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:07.710
It's just a matter of overcoming that need.
India,
Endeca,
Bert,

1934
01:42:09.970 --> 01:42:14.250
I've gotten so confused with whatever,
Endeca or whichever,
like what?

1935
01:42:14.260 --> 01:42:16.060
Every time I ever a conversation with someone,
they're like,
oh,

1936
01:42:16.061 --> 01:42:17.710
you need the one that doesn't make you think right?

1937
01:42:17.740 --> 01:42:19.630
Well you weren't the one that does it.
Make your body,

1938
01:42:19.631 --> 01:42:21.520
you don't want to feel in your body.
And I'm like,
oh,

1939
01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:24.210
it seems like that you're overthinking everything so that it seems like the,

1940
01:42:24.910 --> 01:42:27.780
I don't think it's any different than anyone else.
I don't think I'm,

1941
01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:33.100
I don't think I'm,
I,
I think if anyone had in my life style or my life,

1942
01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:35.830
like when you travel,
you're gone all the time.
You're jumping off buildings,

1943
01:42:35.831 --> 01:42:38.770
you jumping out of planes.
Right.
I think if anyone had my life,

1944
01:42:38.771 --> 01:42:41.890
they'd go through this shit just has a noticeably change since you started doing

1945
01:42:41.891 --> 01:42:44.680
this show.
It's gotten much better.
Last year it was really bad,

1946
01:42:44.860 --> 01:42:46.570
but I've gotten much better with my anxiety.

1947
01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:50.080
Like now I can appreciate things and go,
wow,

1948
01:42:50.081 --> 01:42:51.580
this is really cool that I'm getting to do this.

1949
01:42:51.581 --> 01:42:54.550
Like last year I was just a fucking wreck.
I would find,

1950
01:42:54.551 --> 01:42:57.820
I would find injury and the smallest thing I'd be like,
that's going to,

1951
01:42:57.821 --> 01:42:59.980
I'm going to be doing a belly flop contest,
and I was like,

1952
01:42:59.981 --> 01:43:03.220
what if there's like a stick?
I mean it's going to fucking impale myself on.

1953
01:43:03.221 --> 01:43:06.280
It took a good question.
Should we look out for sticks?
Thank you.

1954
01:43:06.310 --> 01:43:08.860
Everyone was like,
are you out of your fucking mind?
You're going to break it?

1955
01:43:08.861 --> 01:43:10.710
And I was like,
no.
It'll go right through my body and I'll dye.

1956
01:43:10.730 --> 01:43:11.950
It depends on how big the stick is.

1957
01:43:11.951 --> 01:43:14.230
They're all confident that you gonna to break it.
I guess I don't,

1958
01:43:15.060 --> 01:43:18.820
but I've gotten much better.
You'd be fun to be in production with.
You're like,

1959
01:43:18.821 --> 01:43:19.690
yeah,
that's a good question.

1960
01:43:20.610 --> 01:43:24.790
I'm the worst places when it comes to anything dangerous.
I'm the guy's like,

1961
01:43:24.791 --> 01:43:28.090
well listen,
listen.
You'd take chances,
motherfucker.
Okay.
Nothing wrong with that,

1962
01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:30.390
but you better be aware of what you're doing.
You know,
don't,

1963
01:43:30.391 --> 01:43:34.130
don't be stupid about it.
Take informed chances.
You know,
this,

1964
01:43:34.140 --> 01:43:36.950
this season has been a lot of fun,
a lot of fun issue.
Does it,
um,

1965
01:43:37.060 --> 01:43:39.160
do you do comedy when you're on the road like filming?

1966
01:43:39.161 --> 01:43:43.630
Do you like scheduled gigs and it,
but if I do comedy all of a sudden all the,

1967
01:43:43.930 --> 01:43:45.310
all the chaos in my,

1968
01:43:45.550 --> 01:43:49.690
all the chaos gets real fucking mellow cause I can talk and I feel like I'm

1969
01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:52.040
getting that outlet.
Like I have,
I

1970
01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:55.700
<v 3>was in the middle of like a month stretch from Alaska to New York to DC to</v>

1971
01:43:55.701 --> 01:43:58.280
Indianapolis and then leaving Indianapolis.

1972
01:43:58.281 --> 01:43:59.960
We had to fly to Cincinnati and my wife's like,

1973
01:44:00.230 --> 01:44:02.930
and I'm complaining to her about my brain or whatever.

1974
01:44:02.931 --> 01:44:06.410
I'm fucking his role in me.
And then she was like,
just go get on stage.

1975
01:44:06.411 --> 01:44:09.110
Just go over to the,
to the funny bone in Cincinnati and get on stage.

1976
01:44:09.410 --> 01:44:11.570
It's kind of like I was,
like I said,
this is a good idea

1977
01:44:11.900 --> 01:44:13.610
<v 1>cause it's almost like a form of exercise,</v>

1978
01:44:13.611 --> 01:44:17.150
like this x amount of energy that you expend on stage.
Oh yeah.

1979
01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:22.330
<v 3>Like,
like I,
I think I,
one of the things that's wrong with me is I don't,</v>

1980
01:44:22.390 --> 01:44:25.060
I don't listen very well and I talk more than I listen.

1981
01:44:25.390 --> 01:44:27.100
Like some people are good listeners.

1982
01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:31.580
I feel like I'm all fucking exporting data.
Well listen,
you're

1983
01:44:31.940 --> 01:44:34.970
<v 1>where that,
so you,
you'll be a better listener.
It's that simple.</v>

1984
01:44:35.210 --> 01:44:37.790
If you're aware of one thing that's fucking with you or one thing that you don't

1985
01:44:37.791 --> 01:44:40.490
like about how you behave,
that,
that's step one.

1986
01:44:40.610 --> 01:44:42.760
That's me even more than step one,
that step,

1987
01:44:42.770 --> 01:44:44.810
step one is like thinking what's wrong with me?

1988
01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:47.390
Step two is like figuring out what it is you're at.
Step two,

1989
01:44:47.420 --> 01:44:48.260
you already know what it is,

1990
01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:52.920
<v 3>the,
um,
but yeah,
but I think once I do stand up,
uh,</v>

1991
01:44:52.940 --> 01:44:55.780
that I start,
I start listening.
So I'm done talking.

1992
01:44:56.270 --> 01:44:57.970
Do you ever get done with like a long stretch and you're like,

1993
01:44:57.971 --> 01:45:01.880
I'm fucking do not to hear myself speak?
Yes,
sure.
I'm done talking.
I just want,

1994
01:45:01.881 --> 01:45:04.360
it's hard to discipline myself to listen to tapes when that happens.

1995
01:45:04.470 --> 01:45:07.770
You can fucking listen to tapes.
I've never listened to a tape ever really there.

1996
01:45:07.771 --> 01:45:11.170
How do you go over your bits?
It's all my head.
Whoa.
Yeah.

1997
01:45:11.590 --> 01:45:14.140
Do you think that that's the best way to do it or you just test the best way for

1998
01:45:14.141 --> 01:45:18.220
you?
I,
I,
I know this,
that the best way to do it because anytime I look at a tape,

1999
01:45:18.221 --> 01:45:21.940
I go,
man,
I should have fucking,
I can do that different.
And it always works.

2000
01:45:21.941 --> 01:45:22.720
But I'm,

2001
01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:27.130
I hate looking at myself on film and just watching it and going over it and be

2002
01:45:27.140 --> 01:45:27.973
in like,

2003
01:45:28.000 --> 01:45:30.980
<v 1>you know what I say to myself,
but I say,
you're a professional.</v>

2004
01:45:31.490 --> 01:45:35.450
I'm a professional comedian and my job as a professional comedian is to do it

2005
01:45:35.451 --> 01:45:38.360
the best I can and to do it the best.
I kind of have to review tapes.

2006
01:45:38.361 --> 01:45:39.410
I have to actually write,

2007
01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:42.680
I have to take chances on stage where I go on stage and I just don't know what

2008
01:45:42.681 --> 01:45:45.170
the fuck I'm gonna to talk about.
I just go,
well I have to do that.

2009
01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:47.450
Go down dark roads.
Especially like Sal's comedy hall.

2010
01:45:47.630 --> 01:45:49.880
I love that place cause it's like ADP bone.
We,
you know,

2011
01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:53.000
I can just fuck around and talk about anything and bits will come out of that.

2012
01:45:53.660 --> 01:45:56.840
So there's that.
But you got to write and you've got to review your shit.

2013
01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:59.330
You gotta to right to it.
You gotta do it all.
You got to do everything I write.

2014
01:45:59.330 --> 01:46:02.210
But I think going through my shit,
it's exhausting.
It is exhausting.

2015
01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:03.990
But that's part of the job.
You know,
as a,

2016
01:46:04.070 --> 01:46:07.640
as I've gotten older and as I've gotten,
I think,
um,
I wouldn't,

2017
01:46:07.660 --> 01:46:09.980
I wouldn't say that I'd take my standup more seriously,

2018
01:46:10.370 --> 01:46:12.820
but I think I've gotten better at being disciplined about it.

2019
01:46:12.830 --> 01:46:17.510
Especially like the last special that I did was like,
came out less than a year,

2020
01:46:17.530 --> 01:46:18.860
like a little over a year ago.

2021
01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:22.550
And I've got a completely new hour and 20 minutes between now and then.

2022
01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:24.980
And it was difficult to do that.
I've never done that before.

2023
01:46:25.130 --> 01:46:28.100
I always sort of slowly built up an act,
you know,

2024
01:46:28.101 --> 01:46:31.390
over the next few years because I kind of had to,
you know,

2025
01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:34.800
but now the way I do it,
I,
I just,
you know,
and I,

2026
01:46:34.801 --> 01:46:39.110
I kinda like got inspired by Louis CK talking about how he comes up with a new

2027
01:46:39.110 --> 01:46:41.120
hour every year.
So I,
you know,

2028
01:46:41.121 --> 01:46:45.650
I just tried to attack it and write as much as possible and in doing that and

2029
01:46:45.680 --> 01:46:50.250
trying to put together a new hour in a year,
you,
you have to review material,

2030
01:46:50.251 --> 01:46:51.810
you have to be more disciplined about it.

2031
01:46:51.810 --> 01:46:55.260
You have to be more professional about it.
You have it.
I know it's your new,

2032
01:46:55.261 --> 01:46:58.620
our thematic of who you are at right now.
It's the best thing I've ever done.

2033
01:46:58.621 --> 01:47:00.360
For sure.
It's most the most silly.

2034
01:47:00.540 --> 01:47:03.780
But I also think that's part of the reason is because of this podcast.

2035
01:47:03.960 --> 01:47:07.730
Like I don't feel like the need to,
um,
extrapolate or,

2036
01:47:07.731 --> 01:47:11.680
or to expand on like philosophical ideas or,
or,

2037
01:47:11.730 --> 01:47:14.430
or try to make something funny that might not necessarily be fine.

2038
01:47:14.610 --> 01:47:17.940
Like all I'm really concerned about as being funny as opposed to,
you know,

2039
01:47:18.270 --> 01:47:21.060
like sometimes I'd have bits about something I just wanted to talk about.

2040
01:47:21.061 --> 01:47:23.220
Why don't I have to worry about that now because I just talk about it on the

2041
01:47:23.221 --> 01:47:27.180
podcast.
You know what I mean?
There's the outlet is better.
So in a sense,

2042
01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:31.440
I think it's condensed my comedy and made it,
made it sharper and better.

2043
01:47:31.530 --> 01:47:35.370
Made it more funny.
But companies all over the fucking place right now,

2044
01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:36.600
everything's all over the place.

2045
01:47:36.740 --> 01:47:40.260
<v 5>What it is your,
uh,
open,
what are your comedy?
What is the d?</v>

2046
01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:44.930
Is it any kind of theme or are you just pretty much sound like some guy at the

2047
01:47:44.931 --> 01:47:48.060
fucking hotel?
What do you do,
comedian?

2048
01:47:48.061 --> 01:47:51.170
So what do you do when you're on stage there?
Do you have a theme to your act,

2049
01:47:51.171 --> 01:47:55.700
their fellow?
What's a kind of comedy or do I go about your comedy,
Joe?

2050
01:47:55.701 --> 01:47:58.730
You'd say it's more like a storytelling based.

2051
01:47:58.731 --> 01:48:02.810
It's kind of conspiracy kind of theory.
You're kind of life,
you know,

2052
01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:06.180
you used to be mark conspiracy,
but not,
not really gonna disappear.

2053
01:48:06.250 --> 01:48:07.700
So we were talking about like the pyramids.

2054
01:48:07.701 --> 01:48:11.810
But you mean to say that it's a conspiracy pyramids,
Noah's Ark,
all that stuff.

2055
01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:15.950
But uh,
did,
did you have more of a,
like,
like Betty,

2056
01:48:15.951 --> 01:48:17.210
are you more jokey joke?

2057
01:48:17.760 --> 01:48:21.730
<v 3>I'm straight up storytelling.
Storytelling.
I would say.
I would say more so.
I,</v>

2058
01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:25.620
my stand up shows more like you're going to watch someone,
you're going,

2059
01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:27.660
I feel like it's,
it's literally you're coming to my house.

2060
01:48:27.661 --> 01:48:28.440
I'm telling you stories.

2061
01:48:28.440 --> 01:48:31.710
I'm standing on the Ottoman and you're sitting on the couch and I'm just,

2062
01:48:31.740 --> 01:48:33.900
you're like,
man,
that guy's house.
It's fun to be at like,

2063
01:48:33.901 --> 01:48:36.210
it's a lot of just crowd interaction.
You know,

2064
01:48:36.211 --> 01:48:37.680
I told you this last time I bring people on stage,

2065
01:48:37.681 --> 01:48:40.050
but it was straight up stories.
I've had always had a hard time.

2066
01:48:40.051 --> 01:48:43.620
Like I have a great story about the first time I met will Smith and I've had a

2067
01:48:43.621 --> 01:48:48.120
hard time.
Um,
I have a hard time telling it because I feel like it's,

2068
01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:51.930
I feel like it's,
yeah,
it just,
yeah,

2069
01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:54.880
<v 1>whenever you,
you're,
you're running uphill whenever you say,
Oh,</v>

2070
01:48:54.881 --> 01:48:56.730
here's a time I met wall smelling.
Yeah.

2071
01:48:56.740 --> 01:49:01.150
Get the fuck out of here just to hang out with.
I think you,
I think you need to,

2072
01:49:01.151 --> 01:49:03.670
uh,
you know,
you have to have a champion fucking store.

2073
01:49:03.671 --> 01:49:06.580
If you want to bring up the time you met Wilson Smith just to overcome the

2074
01:49:06.581 --> 01:49:08.620
weight of carrying that story around.

2075
01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:12.230
<v 3>But it's,
uh,
but it's all storytelling.
It's,
and it's,
you know,
do you write,</v>

2076
01:49:12.290 --> 01:49:13.430
do you sit down and write stuff?

2077
01:49:13.820 --> 01:49:18.050
I can't write a story because then it loses the story always works the first

2078
01:49:18.051 --> 01:49:21.470
time I tell it on stage and fire ever could've ever videotaped it.
I'd be like,

2079
01:49:21.800 --> 01:49:23.330
damn,
that's how I need to tell it every time.

2080
01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:28.160
But you got of almost the way I work is my brain.
I've got to feel the beats,

2081
01:49:28.430 --> 01:49:31.520
like feel the beats and where they go and where they drop and where they hit.

2082
01:49:31.570 --> 01:49:35.630
Right.
And then,
um,
and,
and if I write it,

2083
01:49:35.631 --> 01:49:38.450
it just becomes very long winded.
And all the jokes that,
uh,
that,

2084
01:49:38.660 --> 01:49:42.860
that would fit in on stage just don't fit it there.
They're like longer themes.

2085
01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:43.590
So everything,
everything

2086
01:49:43.590 --> 01:49:46.580
<v 1>you talk about on stage is pretty much stories.
Yeah,
I would say.
So.</v>

2087
01:49:46.581 --> 01:49:48.040
You never sit down

2088
01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:51.640
<v 3>with a laptop,
laptop and say,
know I'm going to do the Russian mob story,</v>

2089
01:49:51.641 --> 01:49:55.600
then I'm going to do the book for me to tell on stage.
I've done it.
I've done it.

2090
01:49:55.601 --> 01:49:58.390
Did it on,
do you ever done Elliot in the morning in DC?
No,

2091
01:49:58.780 --> 01:50:01.240
I did early in the morning and I told her that on his show.

2092
01:50:01.241 --> 01:50:04.660
And then everyone would come to show and be like machine machine and then I'd

2093
01:50:04.661 --> 01:50:06.760
get up at the end of the night and I'd be like,
fuck,
I got to tell the story.

2094
01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:11.410
That seems like a show or a story.
Rather you can tell on stage.
I'm gonna try,

2095
01:50:11.411 --> 01:50:15.700
I'm gonna try to start working it into shows.
But it's also weird if like,

2096
01:50:15.910 --> 01:50:19.150
like I do the f I fight,
do the fight and a bear story on stage.

2097
01:50:20.010 --> 01:50:24.820
I do the story about my daughters,
my daughters.

2098
01:50:25.260 --> 01:50:29.950
Um,
but yeah,
like she never like say say what if you did a special,

2099
01:50:29.951 --> 01:50:32.410
like you're going to do a comedy central special and done an hour.

2100
01:50:32.540 --> 01:50:36.280
He did an hour.
When did you do this?
Probably 18 months ago.
And when you did it,

2101
01:50:36.281 --> 01:50:39.550
did you feel like you have to write on new stuff after you did it?
Yeah,

2102
01:50:39.551 --> 01:50:43.660
but that's,
but that's,
but I also get,
I feel like a hack.
If I tell old jokes,

2103
01:50:43.661 --> 01:50:48.160
I'm very,
I don't like listening.
I feel like a phony a lot,
a lot.

2104
01:50:48.161 --> 01:50:52.030
I feel like a phony only because I don't like,
I guess when I,

2105
01:50:52.090 --> 01:50:55.930
when I scan in the standup,
I traded whatever,
my wife goes nuts about it.

2106
01:50:55.931 --> 01:51:00.931
I traded whatever brain I have that is the guy that gets a job at dean witter or

2107
01:51:01.421 --> 01:51:04.690
whatever and has those lunch in stories and tells a story about golf.

2108
01:51:04.691 --> 01:51:07.900
Last week I traded him for,
every story is fucking funny.

2109
01:51:08.260 --> 01:51:11.110
Every story is funny and like,
and I don't like,
I,

2110
01:51:11.290 --> 01:51:15.400
I'm fucking willing to mind anything.
And,
and if,
if it takes it quick,

2111
01:51:15.401 --> 01:51:16.420
like the rush of my story,

2112
01:51:16.600 --> 01:51:20.590
I obviously shorten a massive chunk of that cause the real story's a little

2113
01:51:20.591 --> 01:51:23.830
depressing.
The real story.
He gets really depressing.
So I,
but I,

2114
01:51:23.831 --> 01:51:24.820
if you tell it to people,

2115
01:51:24.821 --> 01:51:28.360
then they fucking just something crazy about you robbing people.

2116
01:51:28.480 --> 01:51:32.710
Do you tell the story about you working out in the bookstore on dude,

2117
01:51:32.890 --> 01:51:35.650
you got to tell that one.
I was thinking about that.
What if they,

2118
01:51:35.651 --> 01:51:40.150
you never masturbated down there.
There was a guy,
there was a sign up,

2119
01:51:40.540 --> 01:51:44.050
this is going to sound even crazier.
It,
there was a signup and I,
when I was,

2120
01:51:44.051 --> 01:51:45.880
when you'd go to hidden the freight elevator that said,

2121
01:51:45.881 --> 01:51:48.830
whoever there was double doors,
whoever's urinating on the store,

2122
01:51:49.720 --> 01:51:53.200
there's officers on the other side.
So I kept seeing that going,
wow,

2123
01:51:53.230 --> 01:51:55.750
that's so funny.
I bring the freight elevator down here to work out.

2124
01:51:55.870 --> 01:51:57.640
I wonder who's bringing it down to piss on these doors.

2125
01:51:57.641 --> 01:52:00.220
And then I started thinking,
what happens when you piss on these doors?

2126
01:52:00.430 --> 01:52:04.750
Like does it,
it's got to be a fucking really good payoff for the fo,
for,

2127
01:52:05.530 --> 01:52:08.890
for someone to really risk at every month and just do it.
And I was like,

2128
01:52:08.920 --> 01:52:10.960
I should do that.
I should definitely pass on those doors.

2129
01:52:11.110 --> 01:52:14.500
And then that's why I got caught because they were reviewing tape to find out

2130
01:52:14.501 --> 01:52:17.770
who's busy on the doors.
And then they saw me working out and they were like,

2131
01:52:17.890 --> 01:52:22.270
well,
it's gotta be him pissed too.
So I'm sure it got fucking for both of those.

2132
01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:26.490
Yeah,
without a doubt.
But you know,
it's so funny,
like now that you,

2133
01:52:26.570 --> 01:52:29.950
this way my brain works.
I remember tell telling me I had a joke one time about,

2134
01:52:30.250 --> 01:52:33.940
um,
uh,
my name is,
uh,
when I was growing up,

2135
01:52:33.941 --> 01:52:35.620
I tried tagging in my neighborhood,

2136
01:52:35.650 --> 01:52:40.240
so I got a can of spray paint and I was all she,
so I was like,
son of a bitch.

2137
01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:42.880
I'm the only birth that lives in this neighborhood.
And then I was like,

2138
01:52:42.881 --> 01:52:46.730
Sucks Dick.
And it tells like,
that's a great joke.
And I was like,

2139
01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:49.490
and as soon as he said that,
I'm like,
that's in every fucking act.

2140
01:52:49.610 --> 01:52:53.000
So now that you say you should tell the working out in the Barnes and noble,

2141
01:52:53.450 --> 01:52:56.180
as soon as you said that,
my brain went,
oh,
that is good.

2142
01:52:56.240 --> 01:53:00.330
I never saw it as good and I never felt worthy and bring on stage.

2143
01:53:01.140 --> 01:53:05.290
I laughed when you said that,
you know we have cameras down here too.

2144
01:53:05.300 --> 01:53:09.500
That would crush.
Yeah.
Now I'll tell him,
but that's the way my brain works.

2145
01:53:09.501 --> 01:53:11.680
Like I had never thought about telling Tracy Morgan and Jay's like,

2146
01:53:11.690 --> 01:53:14.370
you've got gotta fucking tell it on stage.
And I was like,
ah.

2147
01:53:14.570 --> 01:53:18.590
How did you guys resolve that?
I don't know.
I think so.
I mean,

2148
01:53:18.800 --> 01:53:20.840
here's the thing is that if he wants to tell,
you can tell it.

2149
01:53:21.170 --> 01:53:23.930
I don't want to tell it.
I don't like this.
Do you make him say that?

2150
01:53:24.540 --> 01:53:27.470
Because I don't want Tracy Morgan fucking Tracy one day.

2151
01:53:27.620 --> 01:53:32.120
That fucking hen is coming back to roost.
It's going to get mad at you.
Come on.

2152
01:53:32.121 --> 01:53:34.010
He's going to love you.
That look,
first of all,

2153
01:53:34.011 --> 01:53:36.620
he tells crazier stories and that every time he goes on the radio,

2154
01:53:37.870 --> 01:53:40.680
he pulls his shirt off and goes,
so we'll get pregnant.
Oh,

2155
01:53:42.530 --> 01:53:45.620
Tracy.
Morgan's one of the most hilarious individuals around,

2156
01:53:45.621 --> 01:53:48.440
but I just don't know.
So I don't want to like only met them one time,

2157
01:53:48.441 --> 01:53:51.050
so I don't want to,
yeah,
but it's such a funny story.
I don't think he,

2158
01:53:51.051 --> 01:53:52.940
I think he's as a comic would just stick out.

2159
01:53:52.941 --> 01:53:55.680
That is a hilarious dinner in a weird way.
Also though,
and I,

2160
01:53:55.760 --> 01:53:58.130
and I think I've admitted this to Jay.
It's better.

2161
01:53:58.220 --> 01:54:02.590
I enjoy the people coming to me and go,
I heard that Tracy Morgan story,

2162
01:54:02.610 --> 01:54:04.070
yours as fucking hilarious.

2163
01:54:04.310 --> 01:54:07.070
I enjoy that more than telling it every night on stage and having that to be my

2164
01:54:07.071 --> 01:54:10.730
closer.
And then every night everyone's like Tracy Morgan.
And I'm like,
oh,

2165
01:54:10.740 --> 01:54:15.270
fucking again.
Why?
It's a great story.
I Dunno.
I Dunno.

2166
01:54:15.280 --> 01:54:18.920
Um,
that's an amazing story.
It's a great story.
Great Story.

2167
01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:22.580
And I guarantee you,
I guarantee you Tracy Morgan would have no problem with you.

2168
01:54:22.581 --> 01:54:25.070
Tell him that.
Well,
Tracy Morgan is like Joey Diaz,

2169
01:54:25.220 --> 01:54:27.120
except every now and then Joey Diaz will get upset.

2170
01:54:27.130 --> 01:54:31.060
Do you tell him the truth about some stories about marijuana?
Yeah.

2171
01:54:31.070 --> 01:54:32.440
How about the thing?
The other day?
Yeah.

2172
01:54:32.450 --> 01:54:34.730
You're telling everybody on your podcasts.
I didn't fucking show up for that.

2173
01:54:34.731 --> 01:54:35.564
Show that at one time,

2174
01:54:36.260 --> 01:54:39.860
but he didn't tell them I was over at any Bravo's I was at Eddie Bravo.
Okay.

2175
01:54:39.861 --> 01:54:41.780
Okay,
good.
Yeah.
I like,
I like that response.

2176
01:54:41.781 --> 01:54:45.380
He was that Eddie Brown was and then went to go see a movie.
Yeah.
It was crazy.

2177
01:54:45.500 --> 01:54:49.220
Meanwhile,
people,
people quote it on my website.
I ain't gonna lie to your dog.

2178
01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:52.840
I never left Vegas.
Precious split.
He was in work.

2179
01:54:52.850 --> 01:54:54.620
Did you ever do impression you're really good at doing?

2180
01:54:54.621 --> 01:54:58.130
People will impression well,
if it's so subtle,

2181
01:54:58.131 --> 01:55:01.950
but it really sounds like Brian Gallon.
I can do a few.
I can do it.
Yours jars.

2182
01:55:02.170 --> 01:55:04.720
Ooh.
Oh,

2183
01:55:07.130 --> 01:55:10.310
I can't,
I can't really do Ari.
I have to know.

2184
01:55:10.311 --> 01:55:14.990
I can do people like I can do.
Um,
what do I do?
I can do a Alex Jones.

2185
01:55:15.020 --> 01:55:16.010
I could do him real good.

2186
01:55:16.011 --> 01:55:18.820
I could get you to do a good Alex Jones lighting gentleman.

2187
01:55:18.830 --> 01:55:23.510
Black helicopters have been spotted outside of Dallas,
Texas right now.

2188
01:55:23.780 --> 01:55:27.740
We're going to go live info wars.com.
That one enjoyed his or get too.

2189
01:55:28.010 --> 01:55:31.190
Those are my two best I can do Mike Tyson actually was,
that's easy.

2190
01:55:31.310 --> 01:55:33.470
Arnold Schwarzenegger.
Pretty uneasy.
I can do.

2191
01:55:33.471 --> 01:55:36.800
I can do Scotty Jay from boogie nights.
Do you remember Boogie Nights?

2192
01:55:37.900 --> 01:55:41.120
Your fucking was Philip Seymour Hoffman?
Yes.

2193
01:55:41.210 --> 01:55:43.100
Do you remember when this is the only,
it's not even words.

2194
01:55:43.110 --> 01:55:45.890
Do you remember when everyone saw Dirk Diggler his cock for the first time?
Yeah.

2195
01:55:46.280 --> 01:55:48.120
Everyone had their moment.
Uh,

2196
01:55:48.150 --> 01:55:51.390
Burt Reynolds Kinda who's smoking a cigar and kind of went like this.

2197
01:55:51.810 --> 01:55:54.610
Everyone kind of went like this and this is Scotty Jay.
This is yet,

2198
01:55:54.611 --> 01:55:59.120
he was holding a boom Mike and he just went.
That's the only impression.

2199
01:55:59.140 --> 01:56:02.780
Like it's pretty good,
dude.
I think you nailed it back to,

2200
01:56:03.900 --> 01:56:04.630
I love that movie.

2201
01:56:04.630 --> 01:56:07.210
<v 1>You know,
when I was a,
when I first started out,
I used to do impressions,</v>

2202
01:56:07.211 --> 01:56:09.070
but I stopped doing it because I felt like it was cheap.

2203
01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:12.810
It was cheap laughs cause I would see guys that would go on stage and then we'd

2204
01:56:12.811 --> 01:56:15.970
get labs just with impressions.
Meanwhile,
there's nothing wrong with dad.

2205
01:56:15.971 --> 01:56:18.010
I mean it's kind of interesting to see someone doing an impression.

2206
01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:20.110
It like gives you like some sort of a charge.
Like wow,

2207
01:56:20.240 --> 01:56:21.670
I sound just like them all.
I was like,

2208
01:56:21.671 --> 01:56:25.030
I need four or five of those in my act just to like sprinkle them in between.

2209
01:56:25.270 --> 01:56:27.560
There was such a great lake DC to

2210
01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:30.820
<v 3>pull out a fucking,
it is my impression of,
uh,
of a,</v>

2211
01:56:31.250 --> 01:56:35.710
of a Italian eye doctor.
What you looking at like,
and it was just like real quick

2212
01:56:36.350 --> 01:56:38.210
<v 1>Benny.
Wow.
I haven't thought about that.
That's,</v>

2213
01:56:38.211 --> 01:56:39.410
I haven't seen that guy in forever.

2214
01:56:39.530 --> 01:56:44.530
I used to party with him and Ben Bailey and Tony Woods back when I was Tony

2215
01:56:44.810 --> 01:56:46.820
Woods.
Tony was just like one of my best friend Johnny Woods.

2216
01:56:46.821 --> 01:56:50.710
It's fucking hilarious how he was amazing.
I've never had.
He's like,
um,

2217
01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:54.110
I mean I think Dave Chappelle's a very original,
don't get me wrong,

2218
01:56:54.320 --> 01:56:55.670
but Tony Woods is like,

2219
01:56:55.671 --> 01:57:00.590
their original Dave Chappelle like is very similar style to date and really

2220
01:57:00.591 --> 01:57:03.410
fucking funny.
And I'm not saying that Dave stole from him.
David's just a,

2221
01:57:03.411 --> 01:57:04.490
it's like he's a,

2222
01:57:04.491 --> 01:57:08.430
he's one of those guys that we've all known guys like that for whatever reasons.

2223
01:57:08.460 --> 01:57:09.590
Like they're really funny,

2224
01:57:09.591 --> 01:57:13.580
but this fucking thing doesn't get on the right track and something doesn't

2225
01:57:13.581 --> 01:57:16.160
happen and people don't know.
You're really funny.
You know,

2226
01:57:16.310 --> 01:57:20.610
this is a few guys like that word like JB smooth,
you know,
JB Smoove second,

2227
01:57:20.660 --> 01:57:24.920
a lot of money to,
there's strong,
he's always been a destroyer man.

2228
01:57:25.130 --> 01:57:29.350
I was in,
um,
I did a Gig in New Jersey once with JB smooth and uh,

2229
01:57:29.870 --> 01:57:33.380
he was late.
We bought were late,
we got lost.
It was ridiculous directions.

2230
01:57:33.381 --> 01:57:35.180
This is pre navigation systems.
Okay.

2231
01:57:35.181 --> 01:57:40.181
This is like 1992 91 and we're both pretty much scrubs and a,

2232
01:57:40.191 --> 01:57:42.590
you know,
we're both starting out and we're doing these stupid gigs.

2233
01:57:42.591 --> 01:57:45.740
And I did this college and they were all excited to see me because I had done

2234
01:57:45.741 --> 01:57:49.160
the Naca thing and you get on stage and I killed it,
the Naca Conference,

2235
01:57:49.161 --> 01:57:51.830
I can all these bookings and I was so excited while I get there.

2236
01:57:51.890 --> 01:57:54.740
I think I've told this story before,
so I'll make it briefly.
Um,

2237
01:57:54.741 --> 01:57:58.490
I get there and well the open,
here's not here,
JB Smoove supposed to open.

2238
01:57:58.491 --> 01:58:00.560
I was supposed to close.
The opener is not here yet.

2239
01:58:00.561 --> 01:58:02.870
So do you want to just sit down and watch TV?
Okay.

2240
01:58:03.050 --> 01:58:06.260
So I sit down in their little rec room and watch TV and I watched this fucking

2241
01:58:06.261 --> 01:58:10.100
special on the Malibu fires.
I don't know what year it was.

2242
01:58:10.101 --> 01:58:14.480
I'm assuming like 93 92 93 and it was devastating.

2243
01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:18.920
These people were crying and there was a kid walking around calling out for his

2244
01:58:18.921 --> 01:58:23.921
dog and he's walking over these burnt down foundations with smoke coming out and

2245
01:58:24.141 --> 01:58:27.200
they're like calling every five seconds.
Mike,
Mikey,

2246
01:58:27.201 --> 01:58:29.450
Mikey calling out for the whatever the fuck the dog's name is.

2247
01:58:29.660 --> 01:58:32.990
And there's a guy who was a fireman and he's crying.
And he's crying.

2248
01:58:32.991 --> 01:58:35.030
Talking about this house was the only thing that,
you know,

2249
01:58:35.031 --> 01:58:37.250
he worked his whole life to build this fucking house.

2250
01:58:37.850 --> 01:58:40.910
Well the opener hasn't come so we're just going to throw you up.
Is that okay?

2251
01:58:41.470 --> 01:58:44.940
Yeah.
Okay.
And I didn't know back then,
like there's,

2252
01:58:44.980 --> 01:58:48.130
I had to learn a bunch of times that you have to get yourself into a certain

2253
01:58:48.131 --> 01:58:52.060
state of mind before you go on stage that you can't just,
just try to perform,

2254
01:58:52.210 --> 01:58:54.220
you know,
you,
you have to put your mom,
I,
you know,

2255
01:58:54.221 --> 01:58:57.070
when you're 21 and no one or whatever the fuck I was and no one's telling you

2256
01:58:57.071 --> 01:58:59.380
what to do,
you can kind of develop like,

2257
01:58:59.410 --> 01:59:03.040
like really loose habits when it come to your,
your standup.

2258
01:59:03.370 --> 01:59:07.360
So I went up there,
dude,
and you know,
I did not know how to start the show off.

2259
01:59:07.361 --> 01:59:10.390
I didn't expect to be starting to show up.
So I didn't prepare for that.

2260
01:59:10.540 --> 01:59:12.760
I prepared to be following the guy so I didn't have anything.
I didn't know.

2261
01:59:12.761 --> 01:59:14.950
You know,
when you start a show off from scratch,

2262
01:59:15.110 --> 01:59:18.300
you've got to settle everybody in.
You've got to calm way down,

2263
01:59:18.310 --> 01:59:23.140
get control of the room,
then start with some jokes and open,
strong,
open,
strong,

2264
01:59:23.141 --> 01:59:25.750
so that they think it's worth following you and paying attention.

2265
01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:27.250
I did neither of these things.

2266
01:59:27.520 --> 01:59:30.510
All I did was go on stage and think about these poor fucking people that lost

2267
01:59:30.670 --> 01:59:34.810
their houses to the fire.
So then for whatever reason,
a joke,

2268
01:59:34.840 --> 01:59:39.580
bombs,
right?
And then I just say,
I shouldn't watch that fucking show.

2269
01:59:39.581 --> 01:59:41.630
I'm sorry.
This is what I did.
I right before I went onstage,

2270
01:59:41.740 --> 01:59:44.890
I watched his documentary about all these people in Malibu who lost their houses

2271
01:59:44.891 --> 01:59:48.460
to fires.
And I'll go and I'm fucking depressed.
And the,
you know,

2272
01:59:48.461 --> 01:59:50.350
the audience is like 200 kids.
They're like,
what are you,

2273
01:59:50.560 --> 01:59:54.170
why are you telling us this?
Are you a fucking comedian?
Like what do you mean?

2274
01:59:54.480 --> 01:59:55.313
<v 3>Yeah,</v>

2275
01:59:57.030 --> 01:59:59.560
<v 1>it was terrible.
And then JB smooth finally showed up.</v>

2276
01:59:59.561 --> 02:00:04.060
So he goes on after I eat dick for half an hour,
he goes up and just crushes.

2277
02:00:04.170 --> 02:00:08.470
And it was exactly what they want.
He was silly and high energy and you know,

2278
02:00:08.471 --> 02:00:12.640
he just picked up the ball where I left it in a pilot dog shit and just ran with

2279
02:00:12.641 --> 02:00:14.110
it and,
but he's another guy.
It's like,

2280
02:00:14.210 --> 02:00:17.050
why is that guy not a giant fucking huge star.

2281
02:00:17.140 --> 02:00:20.540
<v 3>Tony was probably any problem.
Imagine you've never seen him do stand up anyway.</v>

2282
02:00:20.830 --> 02:00:25.830
He used to go on and purposely literally not speak for the first two minutes and

2283
02:00:26.620 --> 02:00:31.600
just totally woods would not speak and just get himself organized,

2284
02:00:31.630 --> 02:00:35.200
real slow delivery and then he'd say something like,

2285
02:00:35.920 --> 02:00:39.190
I know what you're thinking.
A joke would be good right about now,

2286
02:00:40.330 --> 02:00:42.270
but I'm black and I don't when I don't,

2287
02:00:42.450 --> 02:00:44.680
just when I get to work doesn't mean I started working.

2288
02:00:44.681 --> 02:00:48.550
I got to walk around for 15 minutes and see who to go.

2289
02:00:48.580 --> 02:00:53.380
He was so fucking,
he was like my zen master when I started comedy,

2290
02:00:53.920 --> 02:00:58.720
like just really fucking like just,
Oh like I'd tell a story and be like,

2291
02:00:58.990 --> 02:00:59.770
that story is good.

2292
02:00:59.770 --> 02:01:03.220
I told a story one night about fucking old girl on the wait staff that worked at

2293
02:01:03.221 --> 02:01:06.880
the Boston comedy club and I lasted like two seconds and she got really fucking

2294
02:01:06.881 --> 02:01:09.310
pissed.
Started yelling at me after and I was like,
I was,

2295
02:01:09.370 --> 02:01:12.130
and I didn't give a shit.
I'm just fucking drunk and where my hotel room.

2296
02:01:12.131 --> 02:01:14.650
And I was like,
listen,
you can't do that shit.
I was telling them on stage,

2297
02:01:14.651 --> 02:01:17.560
I was like,
you can't do that shit.
And she was like,
fuck you.
Fuck you.

2298
02:01:17.620 --> 02:01:21.040
You better go online,
learn how to read a manual about how to fuck somebody.

2299
02:01:21.060 --> 02:01:25.800
And I was like,
I was like,
you know what,
I don't care.
I got,
I fucked you.

2300
02:01:25.810 --> 02:01:29.020
I went and she was like,
Ahhh.
And then I go and you're getting out of here,

2301
02:01:29.021 --> 02:01:31.000
you're going to Brooklyn.
And so she was like,

2302
02:01:31.001 --> 02:01:34.660
mother fucker and then got all dress got or I still am totally naked with a beer

2303
02:01:34.661 --> 02:01:39.330
in my hand.
She's at my door.
And she was like,
she was like,
I swear to God fucked.

2304
02:01:39.410 --> 02:01:42.170
And then looked at me and went like that and I went.

2305
02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:44.300
And then we both started laughing.

2306
02:01:44.330 --> 02:01:47.150
I slammed the door and then she pounded on every door in my building going,

2307
02:01:47.151 --> 02:01:51.170
Burke Chrysler,
can't fuck for Christ again.
It's true.
Is it true story?
Yeah.

2308
02:01:51.260 --> 02:01:52.450
And so I get done and I thought,

2309
02:01:52.451 --> 02:01:56.090
I told him on stage and then I get off and Tony Woods goes,
all right,
number one,

2310
02:01:56.360 --> 02:02:00.950
don't ever tell that story ever again.
I go,
why not?
And he goes,

2311
02:02:01.880 --> 02:02:04.490
no one wants to hear that shit.
All right,
let's leave.

2312
02:02:05.330 --> 02:02:08.480
Tony was just like the best to be around.
Why?
Well,
he's wrong.

2313
02:02:08.660 --> 02:02:13.000
I want to hear that story.
No,
no,
no,
no.
He's looked in DC.
I give him a quiet time.

2314
02:02:13.010 --> 02:02:15.140
Why would he,
why would he say not to tell that story?

2315
02:02:15.141 --> 02:02:17.330
Because you don't want people to know that you can't fuck.
Uh,

2316
02:02:17.340 --> 02:02:19.540
and that's a black white thing.
Black guys.
No.

2317
02:02:19.541 --> 02:02:21.380
I want to talk about how bad the iron bed,
but yeah,

2318
02:02:21.381 --> 02:02:22.760
there's a lot of things that are different.

2319
02:02:22.761 --> 02:02:27.470
I remember we did a show with Danelle Rollins and red grant with two black

2320
02:02:27.471 --> 02:02:31.310
comics and they were like,
Oh man,
you never run a train on nobody.

2321
02:02:33.060 --> 02:02:35.560
No,
I've never run a trailer on anybody.
And they're like,
oh man,

2322
02:02:35.750 --> 02:02:38.300
that must just be a hood thing.
And I was like,
what you guys like,

2323
02:02:38.650 --> 02:02:41.360
like fuck a girl at the same time?
And then he's like,
yeah,
he brother down,

2324
02:02:41.420 --> 02:02:45.780
everyone ran trains on people.
I was like,
I've never once ran a train.
I go,

2325
02:02:45.781 --> 02:02:46.900
that's kind of gay.
And like,
no.

2326
02:02:46.901 --> 02:02:51.901
And I was lucky at all like a bunch of guys like playing leaky submarine with

2327
02:02:52.071 --> 02:02:55.490
some girl just log,
log,
log.
There's a whole back here.
But uh,

2328
02:02:55.710 --> 02:02:59.390
and but that's another thing that I don't think dance has nothing to do with

2329
02:02:59.391 --> 02:03:01.980
brothers.
That's just freaks.
Serious warning hanging out with,

2330
02:03:02.410 --> 02:03:07.070
and I guarantee you two to trend topic,
who run trains,
dude,

2331
02:03:07.140 --> 02:03:11.290
people run trains and all racists really have you run the train.
Listen,

2332
02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:14.540
we're on the Internet right now.
I've never got time to time.

2333
02:03:15.950 --> 02:03:20.320
How many people can you guess how many people you've had sex with?
Yeah.

2334
02:03:20.720 --> 02:03:24.980
Really.
I've got like eight,
eight.
That's it.
It's good.
You're doing well.
My wife,

2335
02:03:24.981 --> 02:03:26.830
was it seven more than I expected for it.

2336
02:03:31.300 --> 02:03:33.200
I'll say good after that way.
Just you just called it quits,

2337
02:03:33.201 --> 02:03:34.310
but then I remembered you had a daughter.

2338
02:03:39.330 --> 02:03:43.140
I Dunno man.
I stopped counting.
When your,
when your comic and you're on the road,

2339
02:03:43.141 --> 02:03:46.720
things get squirrely and you're a single man.
He can do whatever you want.
Oh,

2340
02:03:47.150 --> 02:03:49.590
things can get squirrely.
Oh my God.

2341
02:03:49.650 --> 02:03:53.160
How many comics do you know that would literally debts what they were looking

2342
02:03:53.161 --> 02:03:56.520
for more than even doing comedy.
They just want to get laid after shows.
Oh,

2343
02:03:56.580 --> 02:03:58.590
every single one.
We know a lot of guys,
I know guys,

2344
02:03:58.620 --> 02:04:01.500
they've damaged their careers because they don't,
right?
They don't do anything.

2345
02:04:01.501 --> 02:04:04.300
All they do is just try to go up and sit on stage and kill and hope they me to

2346
02:04:04.301 --> 02:04:07.740
grow after the show.
That was the,
that my county,
that was the way I,
I,

2347
02:04:07.960 --> 02:04:09.930
I wrapped my head around the store.
Really?

2348
02:04:10.260 --> 02:04:14.850
I thought the store was all like fucking Ahmed.
Sebastian,
Steve,
Brett.

2349
02:04:14.940 --> 02:04:16.030
I thought Mike Young.

2350
02:04:16.060 --> 02:04:19.770
I thought they all just went up murdered just to fuck and then I was like,

2351
02:04:19.771 --> 02:04:22.860
do you think they did it?
Do you think that that's like a,

2352
02:04:23.090 --> 02:04:27.840
is that a valid thought or does that just weird paranoia?
I think

2353
02:04:31.470 --> 02:04:34.580
I did a tour with those guys was and they were just like,
they're like,

2354
02:04:34.620 --> 02:04:36.460
I was doing more time.
You're like what the fuck are you doing?

2355
02:04:36.461 --> 02:04:38.130
Like we were to doing like 20 minutes

2356
02:04:38.130 --> 02:04:41.250
<v 2>and I was doing 30 all right,
what do you do in 34 let's get outta here.</v>

2357
02:04:41.540 --> 02:04:45.720
And I was like a bar bar,
let's fucking party.
I was like,
I'm married,

2358
02:04:45.721 --> 02:04:47.670
I want to do time.
That's funny.

2359
02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:50.560
I wanted to do extra stand out and they wanted to get off quicker so that

2360
02:04:50.660 --> 02:04:53.130
they're worried about,
see if there's Mike Young Brent,

2361
02:04:53.131 --> 02:04:58.100
Ernst and Aaron was Aaron cater all in one room and then you know you,

2362
02:04:58.101 --> 02:05:00.900
you want to be the first guy offstage cause we want to be the one to attack

2363
02:05:00.901 --> 02:05:01.650
quick.

2364
02:05:01.650 --> 02:05:03.930
You don't want to get there after Mike Young has already taken her into the

2365
02:05:03.931 --> 02:05:07.440
bathroom.
Yeah,
it could be careful.
I'll get Mike,

2366
02:05:08.670 --> 02:05:11.130
Mike,
Mike,
Mike,
his middle name is it.

2367
02:05:12.600 --> 02:05:16.620
Mike isn't young anymore.
That's how it should be.
He's like crazy men to does he?

2368
02:05:16.680 --> 02:05:20.860
Oh yeah,
he's got that pancreas pancreatic cancer in his family.
What's that?
Yeah,

2369
02:05:20.970 --> 02:05:23.960
he's got cancer,
brain cancer or pancreatic cysts.
So you've,

2370
02:05:23.970 --> 02:05:27.210
you ever eat with them?
Eat with them?
What does he eat?
He just eats very healthy.

2371
02:05:27.240 --> 02:05:30.450
Like we went to Hooters one day and he had a chicken breast and had a bowl of

2372
02:05:31.050 --> 02:05:34.290
lettuce and I was like,
what?
And he was like,
man,
I gotta keep my healthy,
my shit.

2373
02:05:34.291 --> 02:05:38.150
Clean cancer runs in my family and it creeps up and you die.
Wow.
Yeah.

2374
02:05:38.590 --> 02:05:41.460
Like he doesn't drink beers.
We'll do shots of Tequila.
That's healthy.

2375
02:05:41.610 --> 02:05:44.100
That's real good for you.
Yeah.
Fuck.

2376
02:05:44.101 --> 02:05:49.020
Is that who Joey Diaz has started smoking cigarettes again?
What?
Yeah,

2377
02:05:49.021 --> 02:05:52.590
what does he doing?
Wait,
how I saw him smoking.
He didn't just start,

2378
02:05:52.591 --> 02:05:55.290
it's been going on for a while.
I smoke them one at the airport the other day.

2379
02:05:55.630 --> 02:05:58.200
He was telling him for a while he was telling me that he only smokes and before

2380
02:05:58.201 --> 02:06:00.690
shows.
But then I saw him smoking while at the airport.
What's going on?

2381
02:06:00.691 --> 02:06:05.310
He's awesome.
How old's Joey Diaz in a Joey Diaz.
It's like bigfoot.

2382
02:06:05.840 --> 02:06:09.000
No,
when,
when he dies there will be no,
no record of him.

2383
02:06:09.390 --> 02:06:12.990
Who Do you want to be at your funeral?
No one.
No one light me on fire.

2384
02:06:12.991 --> 02:06:14.790
Who gives a fuck?
Are you serious?
Yeah.
Stupid.

2385
02:06:15.950 --> 02:06:18.990
I don't want a bunch of people standing around crying cause I'm gone.

2386
02:06:19.320 --> 02:06:21.780
I don't like,
I don't want to,
yeah,
I don't like going to them.
I hate funerals.

2387
02:06:22.050 --> 02:06:26.730
I've skipped like the last three.
I scraped that died.
My friends or friends die.

2388
02:06:26.731 --> 02:06:30.060
I,
I,
you know,
I'm more than them in my own mind and think about them,

2389
02:06:30.061 --> 02:06:33.900
but I'm not into it.
So when did he start smoking?

2390
02:06:36.030 --> 02:06:38.490
Because I see him the other day with a cigarette.
I go,
what the fuck is going on?

2391
02:06:38.640 --> 02:06:42.330
Well,
you know what I found out,
Brian,
did you tell me or did already tell me?

2392
02:06:42.360 --> 02:06:46.740
Ari told me a Joey's outside small again.
And I go,
did we just smoked?

2393
02:06:46.830 --> 02:06:48.930
I thought he meant we'd,
he goes,
no,
no smoking that other stuff.

2394
02:06:49.160 --> 02:06:51.230
I got other stuff.
Yeah.

2395
02:06:51.660 --> 02:06:54.660
And then we were working in Braille and then I went outside and Joey smoking a

2396
02:06:54.661 --> 02:06:56.550
cigarette with you and like,
what are you doing?

2397
02:06:56.680 --> 02:06:59.250
It's just gets the fucking party started.
Let's get the blood pumping.

2398
02:06:59.430 --> 02:07:02.190
You know what I'm saying?
My,
before I go on stage,
I go,
you smoking cigarettes,

2399
02:07:02.191 --> 02:07:05.940
get na na na,
right before I go up my,
before I go up,
I should get a little taste.

2400
02:07:06.360 --> 02:07:08.910
Get a little fucking makes me crazy.
It makes me nuts.

2401
02:07:08.910 --> 02:07:11.550
I just want to go up there and got fucking nuts on these mother fuckers.

2402
02:07:12.150 --> 02:07:16.110
It's been a while actually.
I've known about it for maybe a year.
Oh,

2403
02:07:16.111 --> 02:07:18.870
just Terry still smoked as his girl.
So small.
I don't think she does,

2404
02:07:18.871 --> 02:07:22.440
but she did last time I saw her.
She did last time you saw her,

2405
02:07:22.500 --> 02:07:27.420
which was how long ago?
Well why go at all the drunk cast?
The UFC drunk cast.

2406
02:07:29.040 --> 02:07:32.080
I don't like people dabble in cigarettes match.
Scary thing.
Joe.

2407
02:07:32.090 --> 02:07:36.070
We had a on a res,
uh,
podcast yesterday on death squad.
Uh,

2408
02:07:36.070 --> 02:07:40.660
<v 5>had,

Macklin Mac Lindsey and he was,
I don't know if you saw it now,</v>

2409
02:07:40.661 --> 02:07:44.230
but he was talking about how he,
you know,
grew up being a huge drug addict,

2410
02:07:44.231 --> 02:07:44.921
homeless,
you know,

2411
02:07:44.921 --> 02:07:48.790
meth head and he did like Doug Stan hope show while he was on meth.

2412
02:07:48.791 --> 02:07:52.870
And then I dug like when talk to him for five years and it's a pretty

2413
02:07:52.871 --> 02:07:55.360
interesting interview,
but the one thing he says like,
he's like,
you know,

2414
02:07:55.361 --> 02:07:57.970
everything else I haven't touched anything for five years and everything but

2415
02:07:58.120 --> 02:08:00.820
fucking cigarettes,
I can't fucking do it.
He's like,

2416
02:08:00.821 --> 02:08:03.880
I've tried so many times and he's like,
it's impossible.
He's like,
I'll quit.

2417
02:08:03.881 --> 02:08:07.320
And it's just amazing how,
I mean math even.
Yeah.

2418
02:08:07.670 --> 02:08:09.320
<v 4>That's why I'm like looking at Joe and I'm like,</v>

2419
02:08:09.321 --> 02:08:12.290
what makes you think you had a real hard time for years?
He would tell me,

2420
02:08:12.500 --> 02:08:15.620
Joe Rogan this the hardest fucking thing.
I have adequate those cigarettes.

2421
02:08:15.770 --> 02:08:18.390
There's something in them to get in your bones.
You know what I'm saying?

2422
02:08:18.391 --> 02:08:20.690
Amber League and you'll fucking sweat your blood.

2423
02:08:20.900 --> 02:08:23.090
They get in there and you can't get them out.
Joe Rogan,

2424
02:08:23.180 --> 02:08:26.780
it can't get them out and now I see it.
I see someone smoking.
It makes me sick.

2425
02:08:26.900 --> 02:08:29.570
It makes me sick to my stomach.
I can't believe I ever did that.

2426
02:08:29.720 --> 02:08:31.430
So to see him smoking again after all of that.

2427
02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:36.800
<v 5>Even though you say that in which is what I would say too,
when I quit.
Yeah,</v>

2428
02:08:36.930 --> 02:08:40.290
it's in the back of your head though.
Every time he smell it or see a cigarette,

2429
02:08:40.320 --> 02:08:41.220
you still think

2430
02:08:41.370 --> 02:08:44.610
<v 4>I still think about it.
I haven't spoken in,
I would spoke to him.</v>

2431
02:08:44.611 --> 02:08:48.530
Oh well over 20 years.
What does it make you feel like?
What?
What?
What?

2432
02:08:49.360 --> 02:08:51.540
What you what?
What is the feeling?
Why?

2433
02:08:51.541 --> 02:08:55.710
Because no one see when when you smoke pot you sit back and you're like,
whoa.

2434
02:08:55.711 --> 02:08:59.010
Like you feel it hit you.
It's instant.
It changes your outlook.

2435
02:08:59.011 --> 02:09:02.270
It gives you an altered perception.
It's like it changes your body,

2436
02:09:02.271 --> 02:09:04.740
it makes you more sensitive.
I see people smoking cigarettes and I'm like,

2437
02:09:04.741 --> 02:09:05.790
you're still the same guy.

2438
02:09:06.090 --> 02:09:11.090
Like he's nothing like relax as you relax you tobacco for a long time now for

2439
02:09:11.641 --> 02:09:15.840
the same reason.
Yeah,
to tobacco because like,
I couldn't imagine doing this,

2440
02:09:15.841 --> 02:09:19.140
what we're doing right now without a dip in my mouth.
Really.
I couldn't imagine.

2441
02:09:19.141 --> 02:09:21.030
I could not imagine if you,
if you,

2442
02:09:21.031 --> 02:09:24.000
someone would come in to like our lounge and our fraternity or,

2443
02:09:24.120 --> 02:09:27.120
or into my apartment.
I'd be like,
dude,
you're never gonna believe what happened.

2444
02:09:27.121 --> 02:09:30.540
I'd be like,
gimme a second.
Let me get a dip.
Because a good story was like,

2445
02:09:30.570 --> 02:09:34.170
you had to have a depth first.
All man south from sales calming.

2446
02:09:34.180 --> 02:09:37.440
I was addicted to cigars.
Holy Shit.
That guy is just,
I go,

2447
02:09:37.441 --> 02:09:40.290
how many do you smoke a day?
He's like all day,
like all day.

2448
02:09:40.291 --> 02:09:43.690
And he smoked them when they're like,
just a blob and then he goes and crap.

2449
02:09:43.770 --> 02:09:46.920
Give somebody money to go buy a more.
Cause he does.
He inhaled them.
No,

2450
02:09:46.921 --> 02:09:49.830
you don't inhale cigars.
People do.
Really?
Yeah.
That's what I mean.

2451
02:09:49.831 --> 02:09:52.200
Usually people that are addicted to cigars and nailed them.
Yeah.

2452
02:09:52.300 --> 02:09:56.090
Most people that are addicted to cigars.
I smoke cigars.
I don't inhale them,
so I,

2453
02:09:56.100 --> 02:09:59.490
if I have one,
it's going to be because my dad's in town where someone says,
hey,

2454
02:09:59.491 --> 02:10:02.340
would anyone like a cigar?
Like I don't do.
Do you want to come with me?
Man,

2455
02:10:02.341 --> 02:10:04.410
I got a membership at the Grand Havana Room.

2456
02:10:04.440 --> 02:10:07.710
I got a human door up there and everything serious.
You don't smoke cigars,

2457
02:10:07.820 --> 02:10:10.800
do they?
I mean my a friend Matt,
we go there every now and then.

2458
02:10:11.010 --> 02:10:14.040
We a little butt buddies where our names on the plaque together.
We share a box.

2459
02:10:14.041 --> 02:10:16.590
We got a bunch of Cuban cigars.
The shills.
Yeah,

2460
02:10:16.591 --> 02:10:19.860
you sit down and feel like a fat cat.
You know,
it was all these assholes.

2461
02:10:20.010 --> 02:10:22.590
But what's really interesting is how many like celebrities go there.

2462
02:10:22.591 --> 02:10:23.281
Like you see like look,

2463
02:10:23.281 --> 02:10:27.330
it's David Caruso who looks a million years old by the way.
That's like,
wow,

2464
02:10:27.331 --> 02:10:30.060
that was the guy.
That's the guy from Nyp d balloon now.

2465
02:10:30.061 --> 02:10:34.010
Now he's become this weird sort of a caricature with,
you know this his

2466
02:10:34.010 --> 02:10:38.660
<v 1>sunglasses and that.
The CSI Miami,
those shows,
man,</v>

2467
02:10:38.690 --> 02:10:39.920
you doing one of those shows,
man,

2468
02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:43.130
you want to talk about a life changing thing that's your new life pal.

2469
02:10:43.270 --> 02:10:44.390
You're new,
your new life.

2470
02:10:44.420 --> 02:10:47.150
It revolves around this show that you're doing because you're going to film it

2471
02:10:47.151 --> 02:10:50.660
most of the year and you're going to film it most of the day,
most of the week,

2472
02:10:50.870 --> 02:10:54.170
almost the entire week.
You're going to be spent filming five,
six days a week,

2473
02:10:54.171 --> 02:10:58.520
12 hour days,
sometimes more depending on which shots need to get done.
Those,

2474
02:10:58.521 --> 02:11:02.120
those fucking shows are Baroud All.
I've had a bunch of offers.

2475
02:11:02.121 --> 02:11:04.670
I've had a few things come my way where you know they wanted to meet me for

2476
02:11:04.671 --> 02:11:08.840
something like that.
I'm like,
what is it?
Single camera dramas.
Stop,
stop talking,

2477
02:11:09.080 --> 02:11:12.200
stop talking to me.
I'm not doing,
it.
Don't seem like a five year plan,

2478
02:11:12.560 --> 02:11:15.200
five year plan.
The more time goes on,
man,

2479
02:11:15.230 --> 02:11:17.720
the more I am just enjoying doing comedy,

2480
02:11:17.960 --> 02:11:21.710
doing the podcast and doing the UFC and I wished the UFC.

2481
02:11:21.711 --> 02:11:25.800
I would like to do less of those.
I love doing it,
but sometimes I traveled,
uh,

2482
02:11:25.840 --> 02:11:29.080
just a bit too much.
I would love it if it was like in la or something like that,

2483
02:11:29.420 --> 02:11:33.110
but sometimes it's hard,
but when I'm there,
I never wish I was anywhere else.

2484
02:11:33.111 --> 02:11:35.120
It's,
I will,
I'm enjoying everything I do.

2485
02:11:35.390 --> 02:11:38.750
So I'm very careful right now to make sure that I don't take on anything else

2486
02:11:38.751 --> 02:11:41.990
that I don't enjoy.
Because right now my life is like a little masterpiece.

2487
02:11:41.991 --> 02:11:44.630
Like I've got it set up.
So I'm like,
when I'm in town,

2488
02:11:44.690 --> 02:11:48.920
I'm enjoying everything I'm doing.
I have the greatest group of friends,
you know,

2489
02:11:48.921 --> 02:11:52.520
and a part of it is this podcast,
you know,
and now because of this podcast,

2490
02:11:53.210 --> 02:11:55.160
the people that are coming to see me at the shows are different.

2491
02:11:55.400 --> 02:11:58.550
It's like now they're all podcast fans and they really know where the fuck I'm

2492
02:11:58.551 --> 02:12:00.800
coming from.
And we're all,
we're,
we're all coming from.
I mean,

2493
02:12:00.801 --> 02:12:03.620
Brian gets fucking huge rounds of applause when he goes on stage.

2494
02:12:03.621 --> 02:12:06.740
Now Brian do like five minutes sets and in Portland's gets huge round of

2495
02:12:06.741 --> 02:12:08.720
applause.
Ari does two huge,

2496
02:12:08.721 --> 02:12:12.740
huge round of applause in Seattle as the puff daddy of podcasts.
Bollen Bro.

2497
02:12:12.950 --> 02:12:15.410
But it's,
you know,
it's all good stuff.

2498
02:12:15.440 --> 02:12:18.920
It's not like when I was doing fear factor,
it was like,
it was a great job.

2499
02:12:18.921 --> 02:12:22.100
It was,
you know,
it paid ridiculous money and it was really easy.

2500
02:12:22.101 --> 02:12:24.710
It was three days a week,
but during those three days,

2501
02:12:24.740 --> 02:12:28.340
I would wish I was doing something else and I did it,
you know,
happily,

2502
02:12:28.350 --> 02:12:32.000
cause it was a lot of money.
But there's never a time when I'm doing a podcast.

2503
02:12:32.240 --> 02:12:33.470
Never a time when I'm doing standup.

2504
02:12:33.471 --> 02:12:35.240
Never a time when I'm doing the UFC where I go,
wow,

2505
02:12:35.270 --> 02:12:38.690
I wish I was doing something else.
Every time this UFC,
I'm like,
fuck yeah,

2506
02:12:38.720 --> 02:12:42.350
here we go.
You know the,
the bone bone,
the sound comes on the lights.

2507
02:12:42.351 --> 02:12:44.560
Dim first fight starts.
I'm like,
Woah.

2508
02:12:44.590 --> 02:12:47.870
Punched knuckles with Mike Goldberg here would go every time.
Man.

2509
02:12:47.871 --> 02:12:51.510
I'm like a little kid.
I love it.
I just never a time when I'm like,
God can't.

2510
02:12:51.530 --> 02:12:53.650
I'm sitting here watching fights,
never,
never.

2511
02:12:53.660 --> 02:12:55.490
And to stand up right before I'm going to go on stage.

2512
02:12:55.700 --> 02:12:58.700
There's never a time where I'm like,
fuck,
I can't believe I'm doing standup.

2513
02:12:58.940 --> 02:12:59.990
Never.
Never.

2514
02:13:00.090 --> 02:13:04.950
<v 3>No.
I know.
How,
um,
how much,
how much does money,</v>

2515
02:13:05.080 --> 02:13:07.350
um,
incorporating to any of your decision making?

2516
02:13:07.830 --> 02:13:09.910
<v 1>Well,
yeah,
it has to,
you know,</v>

2517
02:13:09.930 --> 02:13:13.680
but luckily I make good money from the UFC and I make good money from stand up

2518
02:13:13.681 --> 02:13:16.440
so it doesn't have to,
it's like long as those things are covered,

2519
02:13:16.650 --> 02:13:18.660
then I don't have to think about it.
It's when they're not covered,

2520
02:13:18.780 --> 02:13:21.540
then it has to become an issue.
Like say okay,
go ahead.
Like I say,

2521
02:13:21.541 --> 02:13:23.130
when I first started doing fear factor,

2522
02:13:23.131 --> 02:13:24.870
I was not making really good money with standup.

2523
02:13:24.900 --> 02:13:27.070
I was doing news radio the same time.

2524
02:13:27.071 --> 02:13:29.340
Can you tell me how much you're making one stand up back then?

2525
02:13:29.970 --> 02:13:33.480
A few grand a week.
A couple grand,
a couple grand or two grand.

2526
02:13:33.481 --> 02:13:36.690
2,500 maybe on a good week.
But I was doing like Thursday through Sunday,

2527
02:13:36.691 --> 02:13:38.520
you know,
maybe news radio was getting,

2528
02:13:38.630 --> 02:13:42.300
it was a little more than that towards the end because it was 99 when I put out

2529
02:13:42.301 --> 02:13:44.010
my CD and that,
that definitely helped.

2530
02:13:44.011 --> 02:13:46.590
And I was getting paid better and clubs and there was some places where I could

2531
02:13:46.591 --> 02:13:50.130
sell out,
but there was inconsistent and it's few and far between.

2532
02:13:50.340 --> 02:13:52.470
So like when something like fear factor came up,
it was like,

2533
02:13:52.490 --> 02:13:55.680
well here's a good chance to make really good money.
You know?

2534
02:13:55.890 --> 02:13:58.080
And when you say like 2,500 people go,
wow,
that's a lot of money.

2535
02:13:58.230 --> 02:14:00.240
But then you know when you take away agent's fees,

2536
02:14:00.241 --> 02:14:03.300
manager manager's fees and also business manager

2537
02:14:03.810 --> 02:14:07.900
<v 3>and consider your own tax and taxes radio.
Yeah,
I,</v>

2538
02:14:07.930 --> 02:14:11.460
I can tell you exactly how much you walk away with 2,500 that was my rate.

2539
02:14:11.820 --> 02:14:16.440
<v 1>Yeah.
You walk away with 30 cents on the dollar,
25 cents on the dollar.
So yeah,</v>

2540
02:14:16.460 --> 02:14:17.940
it's ridiculous.
But that's just the way it is.

2541
02:14:17.941 --> 02:14:20.070
So you have to make good money to stay ahead of the curve.

2542
02:14:20.340 --> 02:14:22.140
And then if you want to be able to relax,

2543
02:14:22.350 --> 02:14:25.690
you have to have enough in the bank so you don't worry if something happens.
You,

2544
02:14:25.860 --> 02:14:29.580
you want financial freedom.
The real financial freedom is not,

2545
02:14:29.610 --> 02:14:33.360
it's not the freedom to,
you know,
to buy things and to own things.

2546
02:14:33.361 --> 02:14:36.500
The real financial freedom is to not worry about money.
That's,

2547
02:14:36.750 --> 02:14:37.800
that's the number one thing.

2548
02:14:37.950 --> 02:14:41.550
Get yourself in a place where you could feed yourself and,
and,
and be able to,

2549
02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:45.040
Brian counts at this to me once and I really took it to heart and he goes,
I,

2550
02:14:45.060 --> 02:14:48.660
it was being rich.
I'd like to be right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But I don't want,
I want to do,

2551
02:14:49.150 --> 02:14:52.110
so I don't people to Google a nice restaurant whenever I want,

2552
02:14:52.380 --> 02:14:54.630
go to a nice restaurant.
And I'm like,
that's so true.

2553
02:14:54.631 --> 02:14:57.660
Like be able to eat at a nice place and never go,
well,
how much is the stake?

2554
02:14:57.810 --> 02:15:01.890
28 how much is the fish?
24 fish fish.

2555
02:15:02.310 --> 02:15:05.760
You know that feeling,
which means,
you know,
I mean,

2556
02:15:05.850 --> 02:15:09.310
I clearly remember thinking like that,
you know,
that's,

2557
02:15:09.320 --> 02:15:11.700
that's real financial freedom and you don't have to think about stuff.

2558
02:15:12.030 --> 02:15:14.160
So the way I've got everything set up man,

2559
02:15:14.190 --> 02:15:15.690
it's like I'm in a real good spot right now.

2560
02:15:15.691 --> 02:15:20.520
So I gotta be real careful about taking on any other things I talked about.

2561
02:15:20.650 --> 02:15:22.230
I'm pitching this show right now.

2562
02:15:22.380 --> 02:15:24.930
It's sort of a based on some of the ideas that came up on the podcast,

2563
02:15:25.110 --> 02:15:26.400
but the really,
the more I'm thinking about it,

2564
02:15:26.401 --> 02:15:28.380
the more I'd rather just put cameras on the podcast,

2565
02:15:29.900 --> 02:15:32.150
<v 3>the most ideal thing because we were pretty much doing it already.</v>

2566
02:15:32.151 --> 02:15:36.410
Might as well do it.
Do it not like this in your career.

2567
02:15:36.411 --> 02:15:39.290
I would say this is probably the most,
and this is,

2568
02:15:39.291 --> 02:15:41.030
this is just as a person who's,

2569
02:15:41.480 --> 02:15:46.340
who's obviously bit of a fan of yours and I TIF a friend somewhat,

2570
02:15:46.341 --> 02:15:50.450
but uh,
this is probably the most representative of you and this is,
this is your,

2571
02:15:50.660 --> 02:15:53.720
this is the one thing that I think when you pass,

2572
02:15:53.750 --> 02:15:57.590
people will go do his podcast was fucking,
that was before people were really,

2573
02:15:57.750 --> 02:16:00.380
they could be doing them and,
and it was just,
it was breaking ground.

2574
02:16:00.381 --> 02:16:01.760
I mean it was like,
and it was his,

2575
02:16:01.790 --> 02:16:05.990
it's your personality will stand up to your personality,
but it also has to be,

2576
02:16:06.110 --> 02:16:10.610
uh,
delivered in a one to set,
there is a payoff in every moment your stand up.

2577
02:16:10.700 --> 02:16:14.270
So you will compromise despite how much people will argue this.

2578
02:16:14.330 --> 02:16:18.250
You will compromise your voice for a joke.
A lot of times,

2579
02:16:18.360 --> 02:16:21.570
<v 1>yes,
it's different and I don't feel like I have to get my voice out anymore.</v>

2580
02:16:21.750 --> 02:16:22.010
You know,

2581
02:16:22.010 --> 02:16:25.020
I used to feel like there were certain things that I wanted to say on stage that

2582
02:16:25.021 --> 02:16:27.600
maybe I couldn't say it because I couldn't condense it into a joke form.

2583
02:16:27.780 --> 02:16:30.160
I don't feel like that anymore.
You know,
there's a lot of stuff

2584
02:16:30.160 --> 02:16:30.701
<v 4>that I have.</v>

2585
02:16:30.701 --> 02:16:33.280
There's a lot of weird thoughts that I have that I've expressed on the podcast

2586
02:16:33.281 --> 02:16:37.840
and I've explored in depth that almost have no payoff as far as humor.
You know,

2587
02:16:38.300 --> 02:16:42.340
my idea about the whole universe being some complex mathematical problem,

2588
02:16:42.610 --> 02:16:44.620
every little thing that goes on,

2589
02:16:44.621 --> 02:16:46.660
is it just a part of some giant fucking algorithm?

2590
02:16:46.661 --> 02:16:48.930
This is something that I've been dwelling on for a long,
long time.

2591
02:16:48.970 --> 02:16:50.200
There's nothing humorous in that,

2592
02:16:50.440 --> 02:16:52.390
but we've discussed it on the podcast a bunch of times,

2593
02:16:52.391 --> 02:16:54.920
so I totally believe that in parallel states.
Yeah,

2594
02:16:55.130 --> 02:16:57.160
I fucking totally believe in that shit.
I believe that.

2595
02:16:57.190 --> 02:17:00.130
Did you ever think to yourself like,
I can't believe I'm still alive.

2596
02:17:00.340 --> 02:17:04.210
His isn't know
Brian does.

2597
02:17:04.390 --> 02:17:06.250
Cause Brian ate onions this morning and it's hard.

2598
02:17:06.251 --> 02:17:09.940
Almost fucking heart palpitations.

2599
02:17:10.150 --> 02:17:12.110
Brian has this super hot girl too.

2600
02:17:12.130 --> 02:17:14.350
Can you tell the story you were telling me right before you started the show

2601
02:17:14.351 --> 02:17:18.940
about how lazy you are?
Oh yeah,
sure.
Tell this.
This is,
this is ridiculous.

2602
02:17:18.941 --> 02:17:23.680
This motherfucker is first of all this girls dating 10 okay.

2603
02:17:23.710 --> 02:17:28.030
10 solid 10 not 10 phase,
but at six personality,

2604
02:17:28.180 --> 02:17:29.950
not 10 phase,
but a five body.

2605
02:17:29.951 --> 02:17:34.951
She's a fucking 10 she's a 10 La 10 as an ally to legit 10 I don't,

2606
02:17:35.381 --> 02:17:37.930
I don't use la tents.
I use tents.
This is,
I don't,

2607
02:17:37.931 --> 02:17:41.140
I don't judge anybody in any other way.
This is it.
Straight up across the board.

2608
02:17:41.141 --> 02:17:42.590
There's no,
no doubt.
I was just hoping

2609
02:17:42.630 --> 02:17:45.270
<v 2>tired to have sex.
What's wrong with that?
No.
Tell me what you did.</v>

2610
02:17:45.510 --> 02:17:50.040
I went down on her gig.
She had orgasms and I was like,

2611
02:17:50.070 --> 02:17:51.600
I'm good.
I'm going to bed,

2612
02:17:52.790 --> 02:17:55.610
<v 4>dude.
You need to go to a doctor.
All right.
You need to get some,</v>

2613
02:17:55.700 --> 02:17:57.230
get your fucking blood work done.

2614
02:17:57.231 --> 02:18:01.340
Find out you need Niacin and your diet and cooperate some squats,
dear.

2615
02:18:01.940 --> 02:18:04.670
<v 2>Get off the cigarettes.
We had sex.
We had,</v>

2616
02:18:04.760 --> 02:18:06.920
this is my wife would hate that I'm talking about this.

2617
02:18:06.950 --> 02:18:08.630
Don't let her know we have a podcast.

2618
02:18:08.840 --> 02:18:13.550
My wife couldn't figure out a fucking computer.
It's broken.
I don't,

2619
02:18:13.580 --> 02:18:16.020
and why does it always break when I touch it?
Cause you're a fucking retard.

2620
02:18:18.080 --> 02:18:22.250
So she says,
um,
we,
uh,

2621
02:18:22.460 --> 02:18:26.460
my whole thing is go oral first and then we'll do Tutsis.
Right?

2622
02:18:26.900 --> 02:18:31.160
And so we had oral sex and then she said,
I said,
all right.
And she goes,

2623
02:18:31.161 --> 02:18:35.180
well what about just me?
It doesn't matter.
It's so often it's just you.

2624
02:18:35.480 --> 02:18:38.300
What am I linked?
Just get the head all the time.
Like,
no,
no,

2625
02:18:38.301 --> 02:18:42.040
just to squirt it in there and go to sleep.
You're like,
sorry.
Really?

2626
02:18:42.270 --> 02:18:45.470
Do you do that?
You don't say,
do you realize how different we are too?

2627
02:18:45.590 --> 02:18:47.750
I enjoy eating pussy.
You have talked about many times.

2628
02:18:47.751 --> 02:18:52.040
So today even if I'm not horny and they're Horny,
I'd be like,
oh dude,

2629
02:18:52.041 --> 02:18:56.240
I'll totally take care of you.
You don't get horny once you're eating pussy.
Yeah.

2630
02:18:56.460 --> 02:18:58.660
That's pretty good.
That's like saying like I,
yeah,
I'll,

2631
02:18:58.661 --> 02:19:01.220
I'll go with you and I'll just chew it and spit it on the floor.

2632
02:19:01.820 --> 02:19:03.470
I'm going to fucking swallow it.
Brian

2633
02:19:06.200 --> 02:19:08.210
RSS feeds.
I'm saying that's what I do every time.

2634
02:19:08.270 --> 02:19:10.800
Last night I was so fucking never done that in my life.

2635
02:19:10.860 --> 02:19:13.700
Never been too tired to fuck.
I've never done that in my life.

2636
02:19:13.910 --> 02:19:18.650
Who tried to drink and I woke up and took care of her.
So,
but Brian did you,

2637
02:19:18.680 --> 02:19:21.260
you were not aroused at all.
You were sleep.
Well,

2638
02:19:21.261 --> 02:19:25.040
last night I seriously was so fucking bay.
Actually.
I take it back.
I know why.

2639
02:19:25.041 --> 02:19:28.760
I did it on top of being so tired.
I was fucking stuff out of my mind.

2640
02:19:28.820 --> 02:19:31.550
I made like these huge garlic stakes and vegetables and stuff,

2641
02:19:31.640 --> 02:19:33.200
so it was more just kind of like,
you know what?

2642
02:19:33.570 --> 02:19:36.830
I just not [inaudible] system is just crawled down to a halt kid.

2643
02:19:37.220 --> 02:19:40.010
You know where you're supposed to take a nap,
you know after you eat a big meal,

2644
02:19:40.011 --> 02:19:44.390
she wants her box Eaton and she's a 10 yeah.
Yeah.
Meanwhile he falls asleep.

2645
02:19:46.950 --> 02:19:51.110
Maybe you could consider looking at it.
She goes,
oh,
he's,
I thank God

2646
02:19:53.300 --> 02:19:54.470
I couldn't maybe consider that.

2647
02:19:54.471 --> 02:19:57.500
If I had taken an ambien and had one of those sleepwalking episodes and my

2648
02:19:57.501 --> 02:19:59.180
wife's like,
you woke up in the middle of night and eat my pussy,

2649
02:19:59.181 --> 02:20:01.280
you don't remember that?
And I'm like,
Oh,
must be the ambien.

2650
02:20:01.490 --> 02:20:04.880
But I can't imagine just doing that sober.
Do you ever worry,

2651
02:20:05.270 --> 02:20:07.520
do you ever worry that she's going to think that you're not attracted to her for

2652
02:20:07.850 --> 02:20:08.840
I don't fuck her when?
No,

2653
02:20:08.841 --> 02:20:13.190
because normally I wish we were at my house right now so I can just go grab my

2654
02:20:13.191 --> 02:20:17.580
trashcan.
We normally fuck like six times a day.
So you have your trashcan.
How do,

2655
02:20:17.610 --> 02:20:22.610
wait,
what are you doing with your trash?
I Know God,
Jesus Christ,

2656
02:20:22.670 --> 02:20:25.580
the national average is six times a month.
I know.

2657
02:20:25.590 --> 02:20:29.690
That's what my normal average is too.
Fucking paraplegics.

2658
02:20:29.840 --> 02:20:32.180
She's the one that I'm very lucky because she's one of those girls that you

2659
02:20:32.181 --> 02:20:36.560
could just touch her in her arms.
She goes,
oh,
I can like that.

2660
02:20:36.830 --> 02:20:39.050
It says she's just fucking nice to you the other day.

2661
02:20:39.290 --> 02:20:42.320
Why do I find listening to you?
Fuck talks so distasteful.

2662
02:20:44.590 --> 02:20:48.380
There's something about it just,
I'm like,
I'm going like this with my mouth.

2663
02:20:50.120 --> 02:20:52.340
She's one of these girls that always grabbed your hand when you're just in the

2664
02:20:52.341 --> 02:20:54.590
middle of conversation and she just puts her hand in her pussy and it's just

2665
02:20:54.591 --> 02:20:59.270
like juice.
Yeah,
it was those don't exist in my world.
They no,
never.
No.

2666
02:20:59.271 --> 02:21:02.600
I've never had any of,
you have a very small like test group.

2667
02:21:02.900 --> 02:21:05.390
You're working with people.
She didn't.

2668
02:21:05.391 --> 02:21:09.770
I'm target marking out of Iowa was trying to learn how rice krispies cell only

2669
02:21:09.771 --> 02:21:12.800
have this one city.
Did you say that your show is um,
targeted,

2670
02:21:12.801 --> 02:21:15.680
like that whole network is targeted towards women towards women?
Yes.
Network.

2671
02:21:16.140 --> 02:21:18.980
He's on a travel channel,
which by the way,
one of my favorite shows that too.

2672
02:21:18.981 --> 02:21:21.890
Two of my favorite shows a Anthony Bourdain's.
No reservations.

2673
02:21:21.891 --> 02:21:22.880
I fucking loved that show.

2674
02:21:23.390 --> 02:21:27.140
Great show and made it really recommended some great restaurants to me because

2675
02:21:27.141 --> 02:21:31.010
of that show.
I found out about a,
a great seafood place.
God,

2676
02:21:31.011 --> 02:21:32.600
I can't remember the name in Austin.

2677
02:21:32.690 --> 02:21:34.400
It would be great if I could pull the name out of my ass.

2678
02:21:34.640 --> 02:21:37.700
But it was a fantastic seafood place in Austin that I found out about.

2679
02:21:37.820 --> 02:21:41.180
I found out about places in la found out about a place in La,

2680
02:21:41.181 --> 02:21:43.580
a Mexican joint that serves goats.
Okay.

2681
02:21:43.581 --> 02:21:46.520
They have giant fucking like sides of goat.

2682
02:21:46.521 --> 02:21:49.790
Next song it with a band saw and cooking it all together.

2683
02:21:49.791 --> 02:21:53.890
They cook like hundreds of pounds of goat every day.
The amazing,
you know,

2684
02:21:54.150 --> 02:21:55.460
I found out about a bunch of great places.

2685
02:21:55.790 --> 02:22:00.290
And then also that Steve Rinella shell you said did not get such good writing so

2686
02:22:01.010 --> 02:22:03.890
maybe you shouldn't be done.
Yeah,
but it might be done.
Do Amazing.

2687
02:22:04.190 --> 02:22:06.790
They're going to bring it back you think?
Oh I doubt it.
Really.
I don't.
I'm,

2688
02:22:06.800 --> 02:22:10.240
I'm speculating.
I don't,
why the fuck nothing.
I know.
Dot.
Good fucking show.

2689
02:22:10.790 --> 02:22:13.400
It was a good show.
But you know,
here's the thing is that,
you know,

2690
02:22:13.700 --> 02:22:17.840
for a first season show you kind of got to hit a home run.
I mean,

2691
02:22:18.910 --> 02:22:20.210
cause it's,
you know,

2692
02:22:20.300 --> 02:22:25.040
people get just as excited about new projects as they do successes.

2693
02:22:25.170 --> 02:22:25.980
They don't get excited for

2694
02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:27.630
<v 4>shows.
It did pretty good.
We'll also,</v>

2695
02:22:27.631 --> 02:22:30.300
when you're dealing with a women based network,
man,

2696
02:22:30.301 --> 02:22:34.140
it's going to be hard to promote a show about hunting.
I think all,

2697
02:22:34.170 --> 02:22:39.040
I think all networks other,
I mean almost all networks really target women.
No,

2698
02:22:39.330 --> 02:22:43.290
no,
not at all.
No.
That's my age.
18 to 34 males,

2699
02:22:43.291 --> 02:22:46.550
18 to 34 males are where the money is.
That's what they always taught.
Really?

2700
02:22:46.570 --> 02:22:50.550
Yeah.
Maybe I got our demographic off,
but I couldn't swear as far as,

2701
02:22:50.551 --> 02:22:53.550
I mean obviously you can make a lot of money if you're Oprah,
but as far as like,

2702
02:22:53.610 --> 02:22:57.510
you know the,
the people that spend the most,
it's 18 to 34 year old males.

2703
02:22:57.540 --> 02:22:59.520
That's the 18 to 49 occasionally,

2704
02:22:59.521 --> 02:23:01.670
depending on how far they want to stretch your demographic.

2705
02:23:01.810 --> 02:23:05.910
[inaudible] three but I bet I bet unravel and food network and there's a couple

2706
02:23:05.911 --> 02:23:08.220
of those all do waving.
I could see that.
Totally.

2707
02:23:09.860 --> 02:23:13.830
And Anthony Bordain,
Anthony Bourdain's show is very male centric,
I would think.

2708
02:23:13.831 --> 02:23:14.041
You know,

2709
02:23:14.041 --> 02:23:17.880
the way he discusses things and talks about things and drinks a lot and he's a

2710
02:23:17.881 --> 02:23:19.380
fun fucking show.
Yeah.
But I think,

2711
02:23:19.410 --> 02:23:23.340
I think even like a Adam Richmond's vote shows very women love it.

2712
02:23:23.341 --> 02:23:27.210
But women like,
I mean I think women will watch a guy,
they,
they,

2713
02:23:27.630 --> 02:23:31.200
they want to connect with,
connect with you.
And like,
you know,

2714
02:23:31.230 --> 02:23:34.420
that's what I think was a big fear of my show is that I'm kind of a meathead

2715
02:23:34.440 --> 02:23:36.840
free.
I'm like Forrest Gump frat boy.

2716
02:23:37.120 --> 02:23:40.880
So like who wants to watch a guy scream all over the world and,

2717
02:23:40.950 --> 02:23:44.780
and jump and that they underestimated your charm.
Exactly.
That's what I said is,

2718
02:23:45.050 --> 02:23:49.530
but the step.
But now that our show is doing good and so,

2719
02:23:49.590 --> 02:23:52.230
and you told me this and Richmond guy,
this man versus food,

2720
02:23:52.410 --> 02:23:55.620
he got so fucking fat that he doesn't even do the challenges anymore.

2721
02:23:55.650 --> 02:23:58.560
I never said that joke.
Oh,
okay.
He didn't say that.
No,
I didn't.

2722
02:23:58.610 --> 02:24:01.980
When I heard on the Internet,
see if it wasn't yet.
I'm sorry.
It wasn't,
you know,

2723
02:24:02.400 --> 02:24:05.070
what I heard on the Internet was that this guy got so fucking fat that he

2724
02:24:05.071 --> 02:24:07.170
doesn't do the challenges anymore.
Is that true?
No.

2725
02:24:07.171 --> 02:24:10.390
He know he's not doing the challenges anymore.
That is fuck is that,

2726
02:24:10.760 --> 02:24:12.870
I think that's the whole show though.
I think he got fat.

2727
02:24:12.871 --> 02:24:15.870
I think you've just fucked his body up.
Well I think it's just a very unhealthy,

2728
02:24:15.871 --> 02:24:17.010
it was the reason why I said this is,

2729
02:24:17.011 --> 02:24:18.750
there was a thread about it on my message board.

2730
02:24:18.751 --> 02:24:21.690
This is a long time ago before I even talked to anybody about it.
And a,

2731
02:24:21.691 --> 02:24:24.450
it showed a picture of him from season one to what season is.

2732
02:24:24.451 --> 02:24:28.980
He now sees him for poor fuck.
Yeah,
he's,
but he's his body just,

2733
02:24:29.020 --> 02:24:29.640
you know,

2734
02:24:29.640 --> 02:24:34.470
he does all the cleanses and detoxes and even still,

2735
02:24:34.471 --> 02:24:38.880
it was just like,
it was like,
fuck,
it's 30 pound cheeseburgers and shit dude,

2736
02:24:38.881 --> 02:24:41.400
I show you can't do that show for six seasons for 20 seasons.

2737
02:24:41.550 --> 02:24:45.810
So they had to kind of change it I think to make it more of a sustainable show

2738
02:24:45.840 --> 02:24:47.460
for so it could carry on that long.

2739
02:24:47.690 --> 02:24:50.940
And so now it's called man versus food nation and they're doing it where he

2740
02:24:50.941 --> 02:24:54.740
brings in like they did the nasty boys in Tampa or the Cha.

2741
02:24:54.760 --> 02:24:57.750
I maybe I should definitely shouldn't be talking about his show to talk about a

2742
02:24:57.751 --> 02:25:01.490
shot bro.
But uh,
but yeah,
let's talk about birth.
The motherfucking conqueror.

2743
02:25:01.680 --> 02:25:03.360
Tell these bitches when they can watch it.

2744
02:25:03.390 --> 02:25:06.030
When is it on Sunday nights at eight o'clock Sunday nights at eight o'clock I

2745
02:25:06.031 --> 02:25:09.570
will now set my DVR.
Bert is a fucking hero.

2746
02:25:09.571 --> 02:25:14.040
He's one of my favorite human beings on the planet.
You're a fucking,

2747
02:25:14.041 --> 02:25:16.020
you're an awesome dude,
man.
You've got a great laugh.

2748
02:25:16.021 --> 02:25:18.570
You've got a great personality.
Your stories of the Shit pretty loud.

2749
02:25:18.571 --> 02:25:21.540
Please tell that fucking Barnes and noble story on stage.

2750
02:25:21.690 --> 02:25:23.290
It's going to be a crusher dude.
It's a,

2751
02:25:23.500 --> 02:25:26.680
and you can do their Russian one to Bert Kreischer.

2752
02:25:26.681 --> 02:25:29.230
If you want to follow up on Twitter,
you can follow him.

2753
02:25:29.231 --> 02:25:34.231
It is B.

2754
02:25:36.880 --> 02:25:36.910
E.
R.
T.
K.
R.
E.
I.
S.
C.
H.
E.
R.

2755
02:25:36.910 --> 02:25:40.510
That's a complicated as fucking shirt is cool or something like that.

2756
02:25:40.511 --> 02:25:43.060
Can you change your handle,
Burt?
Is Does Shit.

2757
02:25:44.740 --> 02:25:48.910
I used to be Joe rogan.net.
It used to be DLT,
any t,
but it was so long.

2758
02:25:48.911 --> 02:25:51.820
It was impossible to retweet me.
Like if I said anything funny,

2759
02:25:51.821 --> 02:25:54.400
like you would have to like chop it all up because there was too many words.

2760
02:25:54.600 --> 02:25:57.610
Like if I tried to use like I used to think like the new Twitter,

2761
02:25:57.611 --> 02:26:00.980
you can retweet something and it just retweets it in its entirety.
You're like,

2762
02:26:00.990 --> 02:26:04.570
is this a separate hundred 40 characters?
But it used to not be that.

2763
02:26:04.571 --> 02:26:06.430
It used to be that when you retweeted something,

2764
02:26:06.610 --> 02:26:09.010
you had to account for all the characters inside their name.

2765
02:26:09.460 --> 02:26:10.720
You don't have to do that anymore.
No,
no.

2766
02:26:10.721 --> 02:26:12.160
You don't have to do it anymore on Twitter.

2767
02:26:12.161 --> 02:26:15.160
You just hit retweet it and they can just take care of it the way it is.

2768
02:26:15.310 --> 02:26:18.280
So I anyway,
and some dude had Joe Rogan,
he had,

2769
02:26:18.390 --> 02:26:21.880
what can I change mine to just do it.
Make sure it's something that's memorable.

2770
02:26:21.930 --> 02:26:24.750
You don't have to do your last name like Burt k or pub.

2771
02:26:24.760 --> 02:26:29.530
Burt likes to fuck aren't the machine tell your wife about it.

2772
02:26:29.531 --> 02:26:33.910
Just all nonchalantly.
Yeah.
Changed my Twitter name to Burt likes to fuck.
What?

2773
02:26:34.630 --> 02:26:38.140
What book likes to fuck who?
I just like it in general.
I just like it.

2774
02:26:38.141 --> 02:26:39.160
It's awesome.
I don't like it.

2775
02:26:39.161 --> 02:26:41.360
What's the awesome awesomest it's the greatest thing you ever,

2776
02:26:41.450 --> 02:26:44.950
your fans are ridiculous on Twitter.
I wouldn't,
last time I did this show,

2777
02:26:44.951 --> 02:26:47.170
I got like 3000 fans.
Really?

2778
02:26:47.171 --> 02:26:49.330
Well we want you to get 3000 more today and you know,

2779
02:26:49.331 --> 02:26:51.280
and anytime I told you anytime you ever have a show,

2780
02:26:51.460 --> 02:26:55.300
please let me know and I'll tweet it and uh,
we'll pump it up on the podcast.

2781
02:26:55.460 --> 02:26:58.180
One of those.
So bad.
You want a flashlight?
I got one for you.
Are you serious?

2782
02:26:58.840 --> 02:27:01.720
So awkward to buy one.
Well you don't have to buy one.
I'll give you a free one,

2783
02:27:01.780 --> 02:27:04.030
Joe.
Use that one last night and use that one.

2784
02:27:04.060 --> 02:27:05.700
I haven't used any of the ones that are laying around.
Hammer.

2785
02:27:05.830 --> 02:27:09.460
If you go to Joe rogan.net and click the link.
We want to thank,
first of all,

2786
02:27:09.461 --> 02:27:12.790
thank the fleshlight for being our sponsor.
It's a cool company and you know,

2787
02:27:12.791 --> 02:27:16.420
it's embarrassing for a lot of people and now it's become 10 minutes on my act

2788
02:27:16.421 --> 02:27:19.630
right now.
I did a joke,
I was wrong.
I made a joke the other day on stage.

2789
02:27:19.631 --> 02:27:21.970
I don't remember the reference,
I don't know how it came out,

2790
02:27:22.150 --> 02:27:25.720
but I made a joke about a fleshlight and said,
uh,

2791
02:27:26.140 --> 02:27:29.380
I said yeah and then just typing in the Promo Code Rogan and the place went

2792
02:27:29.381 --> 02:27:31.890
fucking bananas because there are podcasts,

2793
02:27:32.440 --> 02:27:37.070
but it was in Irvine Promo Rogan and they fucking like crazy.

2794
02:27:37.071 --> 02:27:39.450
That's hilarious.
Well you said you had a lot of people come up to you and Eric.

2795
02:27:39.451 --> 02:27:43.810
Do I have more people come up to me from your show then my TV show.
Wow.

2796
02:27:44.620 --> 02:27:48.460
I love it because it's your,
your company fans are like straight up comedy fans.

2797
02:27:49.060 --> 02:27:50.530
They don't fucking heckle.
They don't,

2798
02:27:50.810 --> 02:27:54.640
they don't like drink too much and get fucking kicked out.
They're just good.

2799
02:27:54.940 --> 02:27:58.630
Like just random random,
I told you a girl from HGTV listens to this.

2800
02:27:59.780 --> 02:28:01.930
What are the heads of directors of HGTV was like,

2801
02:28:02.110 --> 02:28:06.280
I heard you on the Rogan podcasts.
Dtv h g holding card.

2802
02:28:06.310 --> 02:28:07.330
Oh I thought you were talking about HD.

2803
02:28:07.870 --> 02:28:10.450
That makes sense because that's like the fight network and they were like

2804
02:28:10.451 --> 02:28:14.260
straight up like I was like shut.
Oh that's awesome.
Hi to her.
Hey listen,

2805
02:28:14.290 --> 02:28:18.700
the best thing about this podcast is that we develop like a real connection with

2806
02:28:18.701 --> 02:28:21.490
all these people and it's like,
you know what people tell me is it was,

2807
02:28:21.500 --> 02:28:22.190
it's like they're hanging

2808
02:28:22.190 --> 02:28:23.390
<v 1>out with us.
You know what I mean?</v>

2809
02:28:24.390 --> 02:28:27.510
<v 3>Dude,
the best testament to the show,
and I swear this on my children,</v>

2810
02:28:27.840 --> 02:28:28.591
when I'm on the road,

2811
02:28:28.591 --> 02:28:31.860
I'll put it on the podcast and put it on low in the pillow next to me and just

2812
02:28:31.861 --> 02:28:34.350
feel like I'm listening to friends talking to the other room and it puts me to

2813
02:28:34.351 --> 02:28:35.500
sleep and I just go and then,

2814
02:28:35.770 --> 02:28:37.600
but a lot of times where I had to stop cause I would,

2815
02:28:38.360 --> 02:28:40.020
we'd be kicked out and feel weird.

2816
02:28:40.470 --> 02:28:42.840
I can't do it to a new one because I'll end up listening to the whole fucking

2817
02:28:42.841 --> 02:28:44.850
thing.
Oh,
right through the old reruns.

2818
02:28:44.851 --> 02:28:49.410
And it needs to be Ari like someone is you're afraid.
Energy,
like just very like,

2819
02:28:50.170 --> 02:28:53.060
and I've listened to the one where you guys say you're our impression,

2820
02:28:55.310 --> 02:28:58.920
but the one where you guys had the blackout still.

2821
02:28:58.921 --> 02:29:01.440
I listened to that a million times because I love listening to,

2822
02:29:01.920 --> 02:29:04.220
I love that he passes out halfway through.
Yeah.

2823
02:29:04.580 --> 02:29:07.700
<v 1>Completely gone.
Well Joey got so tired because he needed a cookie,</v>

2824
02:29:07.701 --> 02:29:11.060
any smoke joints and he hit the,
hit the bag.
He had the vaporizer bag too.

2825
02:29:11.930 --> 02:29:14.630
He gets so hot,
he goes down a downward spiral.

2826
02:29:14.690 --> 02:29:17.510
Joey's the reason why I found out the difference between indicas and sativas

2827
02:29:18.110 --> 02:29:19.400
cause I never smoke into kiss.

2828
02:29:19.520 --> 02:29:23.150
I really didn't realize that there's was so much of a difference until I smoked

2829
02:29:23.151 --> 02:29:26.690
Joey's weed.
Me and Brian and Dunkin were hanging out in Houston,
Texas.

2830
02:29:26.840 --> 02:29:31.070
We're in the lobby of the hotel and we were just sitting there slack jawed and

2831
02:29:31.071 --> 02:29:33.740
no one was moving.
No one's going anywhere.
And I was like,

2832
02:29:33.741 --> 02:29:35.850
what the fuck is wrong with us?
And then,

2833
02:29:36.100 --> 02:29:38.440
and then I think it was Dunkin that realized it.
Right?
You guys,

2834
02:29:38.450 --> 02:29:43.240
I think we just smoked Joey's.
We'd know.

2835
02:29:43.340 --> 02:29:47.120
What have we done cause jelly.
Just like,
I just like to get blessed a dog.

2836
02:29:47.121 --> 02:29:49.730
I don't give a fuck.
All right.
Oh Gee coach,
what do you got?

2837
02:29:49.731 --> 02:29:54.320
Bad third I train wreck.
Come with bitches,
come wedded.
He'll,

2838
02:29:54.321 --> 02:29:58.190
he'll just,
whatever the fuck you got man.
He'll smoke it,
but he,
he used to be on,

2839
02:29:58.250 --> 02:30:00.320
he doesn't do it anymore.
Now he likes hybrids,

2840
02:30:00.860 --> 02:30:03.740
which are good because hybrids that give you like that heavy thing but it also

2841
02:30:03.741 --> 02:30:04.730
relaxes you.

2842
02:30:05.030 --> 02:30:07.310
<v 3>Good.
Good for comedy.
When I fucking,</v>

2843
02:30:07.320 --> 02:30:10.230
whenever I get the chance to have a regular life or maybe I'll take off,

2844
02:30:10.231 --> 02:30:13.350
we'd spoken then,
but I can't do it.
No fucking all over it.

2845
02:30:13.600 --> 02:30:16.930
<v 1>You could dude,
look,
we're going to get you what kind of an isolation tank.</v>

2846
02:30:16.931 --> 02:30:20.500
We're going to get you some exercise videos to follow.
We are going to rebuild.

2847
02:30:20.501 --> 02:30:24.310

2859
02:31:01.841 --> 02:31:04.720
We'd ever in my life after shows,
it was really,
I felt bad.

2860
02:31:04.721 --> 02:31:08.110
I had to take your weed.
I can't take this.
I have too much.

2861
02:31:08.111 --> 02:31:12.250
I can't bring it home with me.

2862
02:31:12.251 --> 02:31:16.300

2863
02:31:16.301 --> 02:31:18.910
thing that's there.
