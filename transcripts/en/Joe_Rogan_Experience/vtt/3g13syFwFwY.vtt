1
00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:00.510
<v Speaker 1>Either way,</v>

2
00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.080
<v Speaker 1>I could,</v>

3
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:01.950
<v Speaker 1>depending upon the day,</v>

4
00:00:01.951 --> 00:00:02.850
<v Speaker 1>I could argue both ways.</v>

5
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:03.541
<v Speaker 1>Greg,</v>

6
00:00:03.541 --> 00:00:07.980
<v Speaker 1>mother and fog can improves his hay on the Joe Rogan experience.</v>

7
00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:08.970
<v Speaker 1>All say,</v>

8
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.390
<v Speaker 1>Greg Proops is one of those dudes that actually wrote a book.</v>

9
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.910
<v Speaker 1>I'm one of those dudes who threatens to write a book but never does it.</v>

10
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.070
<v Speaker 1>But you're one of those dudes who actually wrote a book,</v>

11
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.480
<v Speaker 1>the smartest book in the world.</v>

12
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:19.650
<v Speaker 1>You bad motherfucker.</v>

13
00:00:19.651 --> 00:00:20.070
<v Speaker 1>You,</v>

14
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.180
<v Speaker 1>I just learned to read.</v>

15
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.460
<v Speaker 1>And so I thought why not put it to use?</v>

16
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.970
<v Speaker 1>I have another level of respect for people who write books.</v>

17
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:27.460
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

18
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.910
<v Speaker 1>it took so long Joe w e now you think it's going to be easy,</v>

19
00:00:30.911 --> 00:00:31.790
<v Speaker 1>you think you'd get a skin to,</v>

20
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:32.221
<v Speaker 1>cause it's,</v>

21
00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:32.401
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

22
00:00:32.401 --> 00:00:33.300
<v Speaker 1>off the podcast,</v>

23
00:00:33.301 --> 00:00:33.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

24
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.280
<v Speaker 1>I obviously had its cheap,</v>

25
00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:36.723
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

26
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.270
<v Speaker 1>marketing ploy from the smartest man in the world,</v>

27
00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:40.104
<v Speaker 1>your podcasts.</v>

28
00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.660
<v Speaker 1>Because when they said what would you call the book?</v>

29
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.650
<v Speaker 1>And when I went into the meeting,</v>

30
00:00:43.651 --> 00:00:46.110
<v Speaker 1>I was like the smartest book in the world and they were like,</v>

31
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:47.300
<v Speaker 1>love it,</v>

32
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.133
<v Speaker 1>you know?</v>

33
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.880
<v Speaker 1>So that was a couple of years ago.</v>

34
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:51.331
<v Speaker 1>And,</v>

35
00:00:51.331 --> 00:00:51.570
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

36
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.390
<v Speaker 1>it took about a year and a half to kind of get together.</v>

37
00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.180
<v Speaker 1>I thought I'd be able to take like transcripts from the shell and then I</v>

38
00:00:57.181 --> 00:00:59.160
<v Speaker 1>realized they don't read that well,</v>

39
00:00:59.190 --> 00:00:59.400
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

40
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.630
<v Speaker 1>there's too much doubling doc.</v>

41
00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:04.030
<v Speaker 1>There's too much internal logic and this is a big difference between oral</v>

42
00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:05.760
<v Speaker 1>reading and writing.</v>

43
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.470
<v Speaker 1>They goddamn difference.</v>

44
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.960
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes like for standup comedy,</v>

45
00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:13.950
<v Speaker 1>that's like why one of the most important things is you have to do both.</v>

46
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.500
<v Speaker 1>And the guys who only do one or the other,</v>

47
00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.670
<v Speaker 1>it's easily,</v>

48
00:01:17.671 --> 00:01:18.120
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't,</v>

49
00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.740
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't.</v>

50
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean some guys can pull it off.</v>

51
00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.993
<v Speaker 1>Some guys,</v>

52
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.390
<v Speaker 1>some guys just like to just go up and just keep going up all,</v>

53
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.110
<v Speaker 1>all the time and just going over the material in their head like Sorta of Jay z</v>

54
00:01:28.111 --> 00:01:31.230
<v Speaker 1>style and never actually sitting down and writing things out.</v>

55
00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.400
<v Speaker 1>I know guys who don't,</v>

56
00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

57
00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.800
<v Speaker 1>only a key word here and there.</v>

58
00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:38.040
<v Speaker 1>And then I was just in Denver and I made everybody get their book out cause I</v>

59
00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:39.420
<v Speaker 1>wanted to look at everybody's book.</v>

60
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.721
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

61
00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:43.110
<v Speaker 1>like I had an obsessed with the fact that we're the last people who write things</v>

62
00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:45.720
<v Speaker 1>on pieces of paper all the time for our own information.</v>

63
00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:48.480
<v Speaker 1>Like the rest of the world has completely gone phone.</v>

64
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.290
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

65
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.981
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>

66
00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:50.814
<v Speaker 1>But I mean,</v>

67
00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:51.300
<v Speaker 1>I dunno,</v>

68
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.260
<v Speaker 1>EEG you carry a little,</v>

69
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.220
<v Speaker 1>you carry up notebook,</v>

70
00:01:53.221 --> 00:01:53.461
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

71
00:01:53.461 --> 00:01:57.270
<v Speaker 1>I carry a notebook when I perform me tell you a little one of those little tiny</v>

72
00:01:57.271 --> 00:01:58.104
<v Speaker 1>mole skins.</v>

73
00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.000
<v Speaker 1>And so you're but like,</v>

74
00:02:00.001 --> 00:02:04.230
<v Speaker 1>so I took mine out and of course it's just a sheaf of garbage with like every</v>

75
00:02:04.231 --> 00:02:08.730
<v Speaker 1>napkin and stationary from every hotel and earth and the stuffed into mole</v>

76
00:02:08.731 --> 00:02:09.180
<v Speaker 1>skins.</v>

77
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:11.400
<v Speaker 1>And then the other guy takes his out,</v>

78
00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.121
<v Speaker 1>Deacon Grace's,</v>

79
00:02:12.121 --> 00:02:15.480
<v Speaker 1>his name is Jennifer comic and his is written like a playwright.</v>

80
00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:16.343
<v Speaker 1>Each page,</v>

81
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:17.520
<v Speaker 1>it's just beautifully,</v>

82
00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.860
<v Speaker 1>every word of the joke written down.</v>

83
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.150
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

84
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.380
<v Speaker 1>I write like corn,</v>

85
00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:23.251
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

86
00:02:23.251 --> 00:02:26.130
<v Speaker 1>and then try to remember the other 18 minutes that goes with it.</v>

87
00:02:26.131 --> 00:02:27.960
<v Speaker 1>And so like you say,</v>

88
00:02:27.961 --> 00:02:30.030
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you need to write the whole thing out and look at it.</v>

89
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.040
<v Speaker 1>But my question was,</v>

90
00:02:32.041 --> 00:02:33.180
<v Speaker 1>and I don't know if this works with you,</v>

91
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.140
<v Speaker 1>if you write something down on a piece of paper for me,</v>

92
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.920
<v Speaker 1>I remember it.</v>

93
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.240
<v Speaker 1>If I type it into something,</v>

94
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.841
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

95
00:02:39.841 --> 00:02:40.081
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

96
00:02:40.081 --> 00:02:41.310
<v Speaker 1>they're going to read it a thousand times.</v>

97
00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:42.900
<v Speaker 1>They've done studies on that actually,</v>

98
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.590
<v Speaker 1>that the best way for someone to remember something is actually physically write</v>

99
00:02:46.591 --> 00:02:46.980
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

100
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.160
<v Speaker 1>Longhand rush.</v>

101
00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:49.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>

102
00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.580
<v Speaker 1>it's cursive longhand.</v>

103
00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:51.820
<v Speaker 1>Is that what they called [inaudible]?</v>

104
00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:52.763
<v Speaker 1>They call that long,</v>

105
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.200
<v Speaker 1>but I mean just writing.</v>

106
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't write in cursive.</v>

107
00:02:55.201 --> 00:02:56.490
<v Speaker 1>I don't know anyone who writes in cursive.</v>

108
00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.620
<v Speaker 1>Not when my mom does and she sent me a whole letter the other in ice.</v>

109
00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.090
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't read it halfway through.</v>

110
00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:03.520
<v Speaker 1>I just gave up because I don't even the z our thing,</v>

111
00:03:03.521 --> 00:03:05.140
<v Speaker 1>I can't tell what seasons ours.</v>

112
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:06.603
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

113
00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.530
<v Speaker 1>What's wrong with the microphone and that was it.</v>

114
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:11.580
<v Speaker 1>Flopped on spinning wants to microphone as limp.</v>

115
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.950
<v Speaker 1>Michael Michael Moore wrote this thing about running for president a couple of</v>

116
00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.951
<v Speaker 1>weeks ago.</v>

117
00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:15.581
<v Speaker 1>That was pretty funny.</v>

118
00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:16.361
<v Speaker 1>He's not doing it,</v>

119
00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:18.340
<v Speaker 1>but one of the things he said was,</v>

120
00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.551
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

121
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:20.710
<v Speaker 1>the first thing he said was universal courts for everything.</v>

122
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:21.251
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

123
00:03:21.251 --> 00:03:22.270
<v Speaker 1>For all devices,</v>

124
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.021
<v Speaker 1>all computers,</v>

125
00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:23.351
<v Speaker 1>phones.</v>

126
00:03:23.351 --> 00:03:23.740
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

127
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.110
<v Speaker 1>we've had the same plug in the wall for a hundred years.</v>

128
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.060
<v Speaker 1>There's not 16 different ones.</v>

129
00:03:28.061 --> 00:03:29.260
<v Speaker 1>Why is every device,</v>

130
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.591
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

131
00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:30.281
<v Speaker 1>almost everybody,</v>

132
00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:34.990
<v Speaker 1>but apple uses a micro SD USB,</v>

133
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.370
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

134
00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.250
<v Speaker 1>Every brand they change.</v>

135
00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.240
<v Speaker 1>But he also said,</v>

136
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.830
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

137
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:38.663
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

138
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.210
<v Speaker 1>everyone has to be taught cursive.</v>

139
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.200
<v Speaker 1>And his reason was it's the one thing that's absolutely distinct,</v>

140
00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:45.000
<v Speaker 1>like a fingerprint.</v>

141
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.500
<v Speaker 1>Every human we are signature is,</v>

142
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:48.221
<v Speaker 1>you know what I mean?</v>

143
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:49.360
<v Speaker 1>You can copy people's signatures,</v>

144
00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.450
<v Speaker 1>but we all learn our own way to write old government tricks.</v>

145
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.270
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

146
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.650
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

147
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.030
<v Speaker 1>And so I agreed with him on that.</v>

148
00:03:55.031 --> 00:03:55.600
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

149
00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.630
<v Speaker 1>I don't really write letters and cursive like your mother did because she went</v>

150
00:03:58.631 --> 00:03:59.470
<v Speaker 1>to school before,</v>

151
00:03:59.471 --> 00:04:00.580
<v Speaker 1>but I learned cursive.</v>

152
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:01.421
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

153
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:03.910
<v Speaker 1>When I was eight years old or nine years old,</v>

154
00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:04.660
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

155
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.781
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

156
00:04:04.781 --> 00:04:06.550
<v Speaker 1>the way right is always like,</v>

157
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.140
<v Speaker 1>it's always distinctive.</v>

158
00:04:08.141 --> 00:04:09.250
<v Speaker 1>So much so it's a,</v>

159
00:04:09.251 --> 00:04:12.640
<v Speaker 1>it's a segment in television shows and movies and plots.</v>

160
00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:13.241
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

161
00:04:13.241 --> 00:04:15.700
<v Speaker 1>they bring in the hand writing analysis guy,</v>

162
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:20.680
<v Speaker 1>giant loop on the P and a giant loop on the g means extending personality.</v>

163
00:04:20.681 --> 00:04:22.060
<v Speaker 1>And the devil o's or you know,</v>

164
00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:22.894
<v Speaker 1>Blah Blah Blah.</v>

165
00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.280
<v Speaker 1>It can break you down.</v>

166
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.030
<v Speaker 1>And how you,</v>

167
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.880
<v Speaker 1>do you have the same signature that you did when you started comedy?</v>

168
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.960
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

169
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.271
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

170
00:04:29.271 --> 00:04:30.250
<v Speaker 1>Did you abbreviate it?</v>

171
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.641
<v Speaker 1>Ish?</v>

172
00:04:30.641 --> 00:04:31.300
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

173
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:31.900
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

174
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:32.320
<v Speaker 1>I do.</v>

175
00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.110
<v Speaker 1>I have an abbreviated one in case I got assigned a thousand things.</v>

176
00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.770
<v Speaker 1>And where there's two versions.</v>

177
00:04:36.771 --> 00:04:37.790
<v Speaker 1>Not a lot of letters.</v>

178
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

179
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.120
<v Speaker 1>Well it's just kind of gs and P's.</v>

180
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.380
<v Speaker 1>I liked the people who've narrowed their signature down to like nothing.</v>

181
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:45.700
<v Speaker 1>It just looks like a blob.</v>

182
00:04:45.701 --> 00:04:46.121
<v Speaker 1>And you're like,</v>

183
00:04:46.121 --> 00:04:47.470
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't look like your name.</v>

184
00:04:47.471 --> 00:04:48.304
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of a</v>

185
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.771
<v Speaker 1>Willie Mays.</v>

186
00:04:50.771 --> 00:04:52.200
<v Speaker 1>I have a couple of autograph setup.</v>

187
00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.080
<v Speaker 1>I didn't get them personally,</v>

188
00:04:53.081 --> 00:04:56.980
<v Speaker 1>but they were given to me and Willie Mays learn handwriting in the dirties in</v>

189
00:04:56.981 --> 00:04:58.390
<v Speaker 1>Alabama where he grew up,</v>

190
00:04:58.391 --> 00:04:59.710
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure in his little school.</v>

191
00:04:59.711 --> 00:05:00.160
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

192
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.500
<v Speaker 1>So his writing goes the other way entirely.</v>

193
00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:04.210
<v Speaker 1>Like it doesn't look like Willie Mays.</v>

194
00:05:04.211 --> 00:05:05.040
<v Speaker 1>It looks like we,</v>

195
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.910
<v Speaker 1>we mean like all going one way.</v>

196
00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:08.920
<v Speaker 1>And I looked at it for ages until I figured out,</v>

197
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:09.311
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

198
00:05:09.311 --> 00:05:13.150
<v Speaker 1>he's holding it like this and glean that with his w because making a w</v>

199
00:05:13.151 --> 00:05:16.210
<v Speaker 1>completely backwards to the way you'd make a w and a,</v>

200
00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.480
<v Speaker 1>but babe Ruth who went to school in the,</v>

201
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:19.540
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

202
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.640
<v Speaker 1>early turn of the century in Baltimore,</v>

203
00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.330
<v Speaker 1>and he went to an industrial school where the priests and the nuns beat you and</v>

204
00:05:25.331 --> 00:05:25.600
<v Speaker 1>stuff,</v>

205
00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.841
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

206
00:05:25.841 --> 00:05:26.950
<v Speaker 1>like old school.</v>

207
00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:27.341
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

208
00:05:27.341 --> 00:05:28.480
<v Speaker 1>He went to one of those,</v>

209
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.740
<v Speaker 1>his signature is absolutely beautiful and he wrote with his left hand and if you</v>

210
00:05:32.741 --> 00:05:37.060
<v Speaker 1>wrote lefthanded then it was terrible because you were using a fountain pen and</v>

211
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.140
<v Speaker 1>he dipped it in a well,</v>

212
00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:41.140
<v Speaker 1>so your hand goes across your work.</v>

213
00:05:41.141 --> 00:05:41.974
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

214
00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:44.980
<v Speaker 1>Cory lefthander had to learn to write with their hand up.</v>

215
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.221
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

216
00:05:45.221 --> 00:05:48.070
<v Speaker 1>Writing left handed is a real bitch then.</v>

217
00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.180
<v Speaker 1>That's a real bitch.</v>

218
00:05:49.181 --> 00:05:49.361
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

219
00:05:49.361 --> 00:05:51.790
<v Speaker 1>I tried to practice it once when I broke my arm,</v>

220
00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:53.860
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't write with my right hand.</v>

221
00:05:53.861 --> 00:05:55.780
<v Speaker 1>So I started like writing things with my left and I was,</v>

222
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.250
<v Speaker 1>it was bizarre.</v>

223
00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

224
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.410
<v Speaker 2>it's bizarre how shitty your left hand works.</v>

225
00:06:00.411 --> 00:06:01.070
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

226
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.870
<v Speaker 2>It's incredibly amazing how poor.</v>

227
00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:03.591
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

228
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:08.591
<v Speaker 2>I mean if you think about what your right hand can do with drawing things and</v>

229
00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:13.010
<v Speaker 2>writing things down very quickly with excellent control of your fingers,</v>

230
00:06:13.011 --> 00:06:17.990
<v Speaker 2>excellent articulation and you switch over to your left hand like you get tired</v>

231
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:19.170
<v Speaker 2>writing.</v>

232
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.630
<v Speaker 2>It's such an effort.</v>

233
00:06:20.631 --> 00:06:23.240
<v Speaker 2>You have to concentrate all of your right brain on writing.</v>

234
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:26.870
<v Speaker 2>My right arm now is starting to turn into my left arm just from using cell</v>

235
00:06:26.871 --> 00:06:27.621
<v Speaker 2>phones too much.</v>

236
00:06:27.621 --> 00:06:29.060
<v Speaker 2>How I set and use my computer.</v>

237
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.760
<v Speaker 2>You guys getting early signs of carpal tunnel or something,</v>

238
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.080
<v Speaker 2>but it's turning week.</v>

239
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.150
<v Speaker 2>I could feel it get weaker.</v>

240
00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:34.993
<v Speaker 2>Your right hand,</v>

241
00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:35.550
<v Speaker 2>my right arm.</v>

242
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:37.430
<v Speaker 2>You've over used it with the devices so much.</v>

243
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.060
<v Speaker 2>Well they say that when people with thumbs that thumbs now they have more carpal</v>

244
00:06:41.061 --> 00:06:44.840
<v Speaker 2>tunnel issues with thumbs and like ever in human history between x boxes,</v>

245
00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:46.760
<v Speaker 2>gameboys and texting and things.</v>

246
00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:50.810
<v Speaker 2>This now it's all this one movement and with kids there's some kids that are</v>

247
00:06:50.811 --> 00:06:51.760
<v Speaker 2>fucking it.</v>

248
00:06:51.761 --> 00:06:52.594
<v Speaker 2>Dick did.</v>

249
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.870
<v Speaker 2>You know like we've all,</v>

250
00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:54.161
<v Speaker 2>we've,</v>

251
00:06:54.161 --> 00:06:57.860
<v Speaker 2>we've had many conversations on this podcast about electronic addictions and how</v>

252
00:06:57.861 --> 00:06:58.700
<v Speaker 2>real they are now.</v>

253
00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.010
<v Speaker 2>Like Ari Shaffir just switched over to um,</v>

254
00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:02.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

255
00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:03.021
<v Speaker 2>a little,</v>

256
00:07:03.021 --> 00:07:05.390
<v Speaker 2>a flip phone and somebody else just flipped out,</v>

257
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:06.950
<v Speaker 2>switched over to a flip phone too.</v>

258
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.251
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

259
00:07:07.251 --> 00:07:08.090
<v Speaker 2>Rory Macdonald,</v>

260
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.133
<v Speaker 2>UFC fighter.</v>

261
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:10.310
<v Speaker 2>He switched over to,</v>

262
00:07:10.311 --> 00:07:11.290
<v Speaker 2>he's like on a smart phone.</v>

263
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:11.601
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

264
00:07:11.601 --> 00:07:11.961
<v Speaker 2>He's like,</v>

265
00:07:11.961 --> 00:07:12.830
<v Speaker 2>it's just too much.</v>

266
00:07:12.831 --> 00:07:13.280
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>

267
00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.260
<v Speaker 2>I just don't feel like I get enough me time.</v>

268
00:07:15.261 --> 00:07:19.610
<v Speaker 2>I'm just constantly dealing with texts and tweets and looking at this video and</v>

269
00:07:19.611 --> 00:07:20.281
<v Speaker 2>watching that,</v>

270
00:07:20.281 --> 00:07:20.570
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

271
00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:21.800
<v Speaker 2>do you think that Chad trauma,</v>

272
00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.690
<v Speaker 2>that's why they're going back to the flip phone?</v>

273
00:07:23.691 --> 00:07:24.800
<v Speaker 2>Both Ari and Rory.</v>

274
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:25.580
<v Speaker 2>Rory.</v>

275
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:26.690
<v Speaker 2>Rory has been hit,</v>

276
00:07:26.691 --> 00:07:27.381
<v Speaker 2>but rarely.</v>

277
00:07:27.381 --> 00:07:28.400
<v Speaker 2>He's very skillful.</v>

278
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:29.810
<v Speaker 2>Already lost his other phone.</v>

279
00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:35.300
<v Speaker 2>I made a conscious decision and talked about it while he had his iPhone.</v>

280
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:36.750
<v Speaker 2>How dare you?</v>

281
00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:38.180
<v Speaker 2>I really,</v>

282
00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.140
<v Speaker 2>well he really did man.</v>

283
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:39.530
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

284
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:40.161
<v Speaker 2>It's good though.</v>

285
00:07:40.161 --> 00:07:43.280
<v Speaker 2>I know people who use old and ones I got,</v>

286
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.800
<v Speaker 2>I got a buddy in Illinois and he brought out his,</v>

287
00:07:45.801 --> 00:07:47.450
<v Speaker 2>and he had a little razor man and I was like,</v>

288
00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:48.613
<v Speaker 2>why not?</v>

289
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.500
<v Speaker 2>I don't think you have to do everything every,</v>

290
00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:54.950
<v Speaker 2>I got buddies too who are on Twitter that are comedians and they just want their</v>

291
00:07:54.951 --> 00:07:55.551
<v Speaker 2>privacy.</v>

292
00:07:55.551 --> 00:07:56.540
<v Speaker 2>They're not on Facebook.</v>

293
00:07:56.541 --> 00:07:57.620
<v Speaker 2>They want to live their lives.</v>

294
00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:02.630
<v Speaker 2>And I I say right on because I find myself wasting too much time on it.</v>

295
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:03.190
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

296
00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:05.360
<v Speaker 2>Is the difference between doing your business on it?</v>

297
00:08:05.361 --> 00:08:06.800
<v Speaker 2>Cause we all got a tweet and do all that,</v>

298
00:08:06.801 --> 00:08:07.011
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

299
00:08:07.011 --> 00:08:10.340
<v Speaker 2>and go on periscope and shoot each other and be the monkeys.</v>

300
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:12.300
<v Speaker 2>But you,</v>

301
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.480
<v Speaker 2>when you find yourself just going through Twitter,</v>

302
00:08:14.481 --> 00:08:16.640
<v Speaker 2>just looking for something that's interesting,</v>

303
00:08:16.641 --> 00:08:16.951
<v Speaker 2>you're like,</v>

304
00:08:16.951 --> 00:08:17.170
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

305
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:18.003
<v Speaker 2>I could be,</v>

306
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:18.591
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

307
00:08:18.591 --> 00:08:23.591
<v Speaker 2>building a home out of bricks or getting something actually done writing a</v>

308
00:08:23.991 --> 00:08:25.670
<v Speaker 2>Sonnet to my wife or something.</v>

309
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.990
<v Speaker 2>You're reading a book?</v>

310
00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:27.831
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

311
00:08:27.831 --> 00:08:30.020
<v Speaker 2>like my smartest book in the world.</v>

312
00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.600
<v Speaker 2>Like why would you fuck with Twitter where you can just read that?</v>

313
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:35.990
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I Bang Bang on the Internet too much in there.</v>

314
00:08:35.991 --> 00:08:36.770
<v Speaker 2>I little bit.</v>

315
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:40.400
<v Speaker 2>There's a few things because the dull www worldwide web thing.</v>

316
00:08:40.401 --> 00:08:40.940
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

317
00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.330
<v Speaker 2>worldwide web is three syllables and www.</v>

318
00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.250
<v Speaker 2>It's nine syllables.</v>

319
00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:50.320
<v Speaker 2>So why do we say the abbreviation that's so</v>

320
00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.220
<v Speaker 2>much faster to say that we'll be able to web is way quicker.</v>

321
00:08:56.690 --> 00:08:57.780
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

322
00:08:57.781 --> 00:08:59.430
<v Speaker 2>I never thought of that until right now.</v>

323
00:08:59.431 --> 00:09:00.540
<v Speaker 2>And I put it in the book like,</v>

324
00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:03.470
<v Speaker 2>why have we said www for ions?</v>

325
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.220
<v Speaker 2>So fucking funny.</v>

326
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:06.150
<v Speaker 2>Did you find Willie Mays?</v>

327
00:09:06.151 --> 00:09:06.410
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it?</v>

328
00:09:06.410 --> 00:09:08.560
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it though like you and no one ever said anything?</v>

329
00:09:08.561 --> 00:09:10.440
<v Speaker 2>And like someone pointed it out to me a couple years ago,</v>

330
00:09:10.441 --> 00:09:11.160
<v Speaker 2>a friend went like,</v>

331
00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:11.400
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

332
00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:12.380
<v Speaker 2>why do we say this?</v>

333
00:09:12.381 --> 00:09:12.750
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

334
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:13.920
<v Speaker 2>oh my God,</v>

335
00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.190
<v Speaker 2>w w w worldwide.</v>

336
00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:19.080
<v Speaker 2>Because we think are shortening that by saying,</v>

337
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.020
<v Speaker 2>tell you know,</v>

338
00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:20.251
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

339
00:09:20.251 --> 00:09:20.461
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

340
00:09:20.461 --> 00:09:21.600
<v Speaker 2>that's a hip way to say it.</v>

341
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:22.710
<v Speaker 2>Stuttering.</v>

342
00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:24.750
<v Speaker 2>Then why don't we just say dub dub or something?</v>

343
00:09:24.751 --> 00:09:26.280
<v Speaker 2>Some connection to life.</v>

344
00:09:26.390 --> 00:09:27.700
<v Speaker 2>There's something in that.</v>

345
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.480
<v Speaker 2>There's a reason why life is so goofy.</v>

346
00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:31.480
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

347
00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.070
<v Speaker 2>that's gotta.</v>

348
00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:33.360
<v Speaker 2>There's gotta be some connection.</v>

349
00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:34.710
<v Speaker 2>I stick that one in there.</v>

350
00:09:34.711 --> 00:09:35.490
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

351
00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:36.200
<v Speaker 2>and Steffi,</v>

352
00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:38.100
<v Speaker 2>I like words that I hate and stuff.</v>

353
00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:39.420
<v Speaker 2>There's a couple chapters on that.</v>

354
00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.410
<v Speaker 2>Then just words.</v>

355
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:41.550
<v Speaker 2>Well like,</v>

356
00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:41.821
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

357
00:09:41.821 --> 00:09:45.110
<v Speaker 2>people I said like soups and Cray cray and all that.</v>

358
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:45.660
<v Speaker 2>That'll,</v>

359
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:49.260
<v Speaker 2>I said in 50 years it'll be like saying buggy whip or whipper snapper or you</v>

360
00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:50.094
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

361
00:09:50.130 --> 00:09:53.940
<v Speaker 2>people use cray cray in anonymous or in an ironic rather way.</v>

362
00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:55.290
<v Speaker 2>I don't mind that.</v>

363
00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:57.770
<v Speaker 2>If something fucks up and some guy does something really stupid,</v>

364
00:09:57.790 --> 00:09:58.561
<v Speaker 2>someone goes to him,</v>

365
00:09:58.561 --> 00:09:58.681
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

366
00:09:58.681 --> 00:09:59.514
<v Speaker 2>Craig Craig,</v>

367
00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:00.260
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

368
00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:00.881
<v Speaker 2>that's fun.</v>

369
00:10:00.881 --> 00:10:01.140
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

370
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:02.460
<v Speaker 2>If they don't really mean it.</v>

371
00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:02.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

372
00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:03.810
<v Speaker 2>But if they do mean,</v>

373
00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:04.280
<v Speaker 2>it's like,</v>

374
00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.113
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

375
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:08.670
<v Speaker 2>you just shouldn't accept that level of culture automatically.</v>

376
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:09.440
<v Speaker 2>I agree.</v>

377
00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:09.610
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

378
00:10:09.610 --> 00:10:12.360
<v Speaker 2>It used to be some bulwark against the barbarians.</v>

379
00:10:12.450 --> 00:10:17.430
<v Speaker 2>There has to be something against the horde of sheep or willing to all act and</v>

380
00:10:17.431 --> 00:10:18.061
<v Speaker 2>behave the same.</v>

381
00:10:18.061 --> 00:10:18.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

382
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.470
<v Speaker 2>There's gotta be something.</v>

383
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:20.323
<v Speaker 2>There's got to be,</v>

384
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:22.710
<v Speaker 2>not having a smartphone is one way.</v>

385
00:10:22.711 --> 00:10:26.460
<v Speaker 2>I remember Jen was a John Waters who didn't have the email up til like a couple</v>

386
00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:26.530
<v Speaker 2>of years ago.</v>

387
00:10:26.530 --> 00:10:26.991
<v Speaker 2>I was he there?</v>

388
00:10:26.991 --> 00:10:27.360
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

389
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.840
<v Speaker 2>he would have someone take down everything in hand in the Sheaf of paper and</v>

390
00:10:30.841 --> 00:10:33.000
<v Speaker 2>he'd like go through all the messages and everything.</v>

391
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:34.140
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>

392
00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.033
<v Speaker 2>I thought that was,</v>

393
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:36.133
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

394
00:10:36.390 --> 00:10:39.330
<v Speaker 2>I would like to say you remember when people used to use it?</v>

395
00:10:39.330 --> 00:10:41.910
<v Speaker 2>Like if you had,</v>

396
00:10:41.911 --> 00:10:42.151
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

397
00:10:42.151 --> 00:10:43.200
<v Speaker 2>at Red Bam,</v>

398
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.110
<v Speaker 2>it would be is going to the doctor today.</v>

399
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:47.063
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

400
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:48.241
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

401
00:10:48.241 --> 00:10:49.080
<v Speaker 2>Like it wasn't a,</v>

402
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:50.550
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't a direct,</v>

403
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:53.580
<v Speaker 2>it was sort of you were talking about yourself in the third person.</v>

404
00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:55.860
<v Speaker 2>That was the way people initially use Twitter.</v>

405
00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:56.970
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

406
00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:57.301
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

407
00:10:57.301 --> 00:10:57.781
<v Speaker 2>and I was on,</v>

408
00:10:57.781 --> 00:10:58.140
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

409
00:10:58.140 --> 00:10:59.010
<v Speaker 2>get the fuck out of here.</v>

410
00:10:59.011 --> 00:10:59.551
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to do that.</v>

411
00:10:59.551 --> 00:11:00.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm just going to just talk normal.</v>

412
00:11:00.691 --> 00:11:05.650
<v Speaker 2>But there was a lot of people that used it like at your name and then a,</v>

413
00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:06.210
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

414
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:08.130
<v Speaker 2>is having a great time at the movies.</v>

415
00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:09.480
<v Speaker 2>Like who you are.</v>

416
00:11:09.481 --> 00:11:10.140
<v Speaker 2>You haven't,</v>

417
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.820
<v Speaker 2>you can't say I'm riding in the conditional,</v>

418
00:11:11.821 --> 00:11:14.580
<v Speaker 2>you see I'm a third party observer to my own life at all times.</v>

419
00:11:14.581 --> 00:11:15.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm narrating myself.</v>

420
00:11:15.811 --> 00:11:18.720
<v Speaker 2>Greg is having a good time being here on the Joe Rogan show at this moment and</v>

421
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:22.830
<v Speaker 2>you get fucked if you have too many letters in your,</v>

422
00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.420
<v Speaker 2>in your little name.</v>

423
00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:24.990
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

424
00:11:24.990 --> 00:11:28.110
<v Speaker 2>Because if you have the real Greg Proops Esquire,</v>

425
00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:28.380
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

426
00:11:28.380 --> 00:11:28.801
<v Speaker 2>then we'll then,</v>

427
00:11:28.801 --> 00:11:30.600
<v Speaker 2>your tweets are going to be really short.</v>

428
00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:31.020
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

429
00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.230
<v Speaker 2>hardly adventurous rabbi.</v>

430
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:33.870
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

431
00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:36.060
<v Speaker 2>I mean your tweets can be still 140 characters,</v>

432
00:11:36.061 --> 00:11:37.730
<v Speaker 2>but no one's gonna retweet the whole thing.</v>

433
00:11:37.731 --> 00:11:41.010
<v Speaker 2>And I've never going to quote tweet it because they can't now cause you,</v>

434
00:11:41.011 --> 00:11:42.540
<v Speaker 2>you're fucking name's too long.</v>

435
00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:43.723
<v Speaker 2>God dammit.</v>

436
00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:46.913
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

437
00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:51.090
<v Speaker 2>These people trying to issue I have with all of these things is they're all fun</v>

438
00:11:51.091 --> 00:11:52.360
<v Speaker 2>and they're all great and they're all grieving.</v>

439
00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:54.830
<v Speaker 2>And the reason why I have a careerist cause there's an internet,</v>

440
00:11:54.831 --> 00:11:55.660
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

441
00:11:55.660 --> 00:11:56.493
<v Speaker 2>Eh,</v>

442
00:11:56.510 --> 00:12:01.510
<v Speaker 2>I just find that everybody trusts technology too much in so much as the people</v>

443
00:12:01.571 --> 00:12:02.081
<v Speaker 2>who make it.</v>

444
00:12:02.081 --> 00:12:03.820
<v Speaker 2>And then people who are over watching us,</v>

445
00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:04.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

446
00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:05.860
<v Speaker 2>they are not benign.</v>

447
00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:06.560
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

448
00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:08.590
<v Speaker 2>it was this some dark overlord type shit.</v>

449
00:12:08.970 --> 00:12:12.100
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to go to the room full of 11 men and the council of five or</v>

450
00:12:12.101 --> 00:12:12.701
<v Speaker 2>nothing like that.</v>

451
00:12:12.701 --> 00:12:13.301
<v Speaker 2>I'm just saying,</v>

452
00:12:13.301 --> 00:12:13.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

453
00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:15.940
<v Speaker 2>be mindful of all the stuff he tape.</v>

454
00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:16.361
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

455
00:12:16.361 --> 00:12:16.870
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>

456
00:12:16.870 --> 00:12:20.500
<v Speaker 2>people just tape every intimate moment of their lives and all of a sudden,</v>

457
00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:22.660
<v Speaker 2>just like in the movie with Cameron Diaz,</v>

458
00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:26.860
<v Speaker 2>you're on the cloud and it's getting worse and worse for me because I've been</v>

459
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:31.930
<v Speaker 2>staying at home a lot more trying to and so have like webcams where they're</v>

460
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:32.471
<v Speaker 2>recording me,</v>

461
00:12:32.471 --> 00:12:35.590
<v Speaker 2>played video games and stuff and I'll forget that I have that on.</v>

462
00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:37.030
<v Speaker 2>And then next thing you know,</v>

463
00:12:37.031 --> 00:12:37.361
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

464
00:12:37.361 --> 00:12:37.720
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

465
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.260
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

466
00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.200
<v Speaker 2>like a day later I'm sitting there talking and I realized that,</v>

467
00:12:41.230 --> 00:12:41.381
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

468
00:12:41.381 --> 00:12:44.440
<v Speaker 2>I'm just talking like Jamie could just be sitting there and listening to me</v>

469
00:12:44.441 --> 00:12:45.274
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

470
00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:46.060
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

471
00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:50.350
<v Speaker 2>because it's so easy to do with like Xbox live or all these other things.</v>

472
00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:50.930
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

473
00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:54.730
<v Speaker 2>That's a new thing and it's going to transition probably into something even</v>

474
00:12:54.731 --> 00:12:55.720
<v Speaker 2>more invasive.</v>

475
00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.230
<v Speaker 2>It's probably going to be like,</v>

476
00:12:57.290 --> 00:12:57.521
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>

477
00:12:57.521 --> 00:13:00.490
<v Speaker 2>we're saying before like some sort of a Google glass thing.</v>

478
00:13:00.510 --> 00:13:03.640
<v Speaker 2>We're like through a ski helmet type situation where,</v>

479
00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:04.150
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

480
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:06.070
<v Speaker 2>that's what they're working on with that magic leap.</v>

481
00:13:06.071 --> 00:13:06.380
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

482
00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:09.260
<v Speaker 2>Wasn't that part of it was either magically,</v>

483
00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:11.010
<v Speaker 2>but one of the other ones that they're working on where they,</v>

484
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:15.460
<v Speaker 2>they can spin objects in the air in front of them and stop them and move them</v>

485
00:13:15.461 --> 00:13:16.540
<v Speaker 2>and stretch them out.</v>

486
00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.840
<v Speaker 2>Like you could open like minority report,</v>

487
00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:20.200
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

488
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.520
<v Speaker 2>You're doing it in the air minority report was on like a,</v>

489
00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:23.673
<v Speaker 2>was it a screen?</v>

490
00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.233
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

491
00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:25.960
<v Speaker 2>no screens.</v>

492
00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:27.030
<v Speaker 2>You're just doing it in the air.</v>

493
00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.560
<v Speaker 2>The world becomes your desktop.</v>

494
00:13:29.561 --> 00:13:32.050
<v Speaker 2>And I think we're talking about two different technologies.</v>

495
00:13:32.320 --> 00:13:33.370
<v Speaker 2>I think that um,</v>

496
00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.710
<v Speaker 2>the other stuff is,</v>

497
00:13:35.711 --> 00:13:36.544
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

498
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:37.990
<v Speaker 2>the magic leap thing.</v>

499
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.130
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a different type.</v>

500
00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:39.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

501
00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.080
<v Speaker 2>Well there's that Sony,</v>

502
00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:42.023
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

503
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:42.490
<v Speaker 2>this one,</v>

504
00:13:42.490 --> 00:13:42.581
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

505
00:13:42.581 --> 00:13:43.990
<v Speaker 2>this is the watch that's on your arm.</v>

506
00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:46.143
<v Speaker 2>It's a windmill,</v>

507
00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.300
<v Speaker 2>a group of benign people who care about you,</v>

508
00:13:49.301 --> 00:13:50.270
<v Speaker 2>who are well groomed,</v>

509
00:13:50.271 --> 00:13:52.240
<v Speaker 2>are thinking right now about your future.</v>

510
00:13:53.710 --> 00:13:55.080
<v Speaker 2>Advertise that.</v>

511
00:13:55.090 --> 00:13:55.923
<v Speaker 2>So cool.</v>

512
00:13:57.070 --> 00:14:00.700
<v Speaker 2>Anytime you have an advertisement for anything that might even be potentially</v>

513
00:14:00.701 --> 00:14:02.080
<v Speaker 2>remotely dangerous,</v>

514
00:14:02.650 --> 00:14:04.390
<v Speaker 2>those advertisements should all be illegal.</v>

515
00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:07.190
<v Speaker 2>I've been watching advertising slaves,</v>

516
00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:07.900
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

517
00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:08.291
<v Speaker 2>excuse me,</v>

518
00:14:08.291 --> 00:14:09.124
<v Speaker 2>lately,</v>

519
00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:11.650
<v Speaker 2>lately on like a late night television,</v>

520
00:14:11.651 --> 00:14:14.860
<v Speaker 2>they have all these advertisements about drugs.</v>

521
00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:15.551
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

522
00:14:15.551 --> 00:14:16.870
<v Speaker 2>ask your doctor all these,</v>

523
00:14:16.871 --> 00:14:18.400
<v Speaker 2>ask your doctor commercials.</v>

524
00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:19.061
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

525
00:14:19.061 --> 00:14:20.740
<v Speaker 2>these commercials are terrifying.</v>

526
00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:21.360
<v Speaker 2>And then they,</v>

527
00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:24.170
<v Speaker 2>when did they start listing the side effects and sometimes side effects,</v>

528
00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:25.460
<v Speaker 2>death or suicide,</v>

529
00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:26.610
<v Speaker 2>you know like really dude,</v>

530
00:14:26.611 --> 00:14:30.760
<v Speaker 2>this side effect from this one thing for Zits,</v>

531
00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:31.661
<v Speaker 2>the entire,</v>

532
00:14:31.661 --> 00:14:33.130
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what the medication is,</v>

533
00:14:33.131 --> 00:14:38.131
<v Speaker 2>but it was a genuinely disturbing video because you know that happy song</v>

534
00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:41.640
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

535
00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.200
<v Speaker 2>they're only playing like the background music.</v>

536
00:14:44.201 --> 00:14:45.000
<v Speaker 2>They don't have the law,</v>

537
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.140
<v Speaker 2>the lyrics and the music then of the vocals.</v>

538
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:50.350
<v Speaker 2>But these two girls are walking and Bob up and down the street,</v>

539
00:14:50.351 --> 00:14:52.100
<v Speaker 2>like they're in a fucking music video and it's</v>

540
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:56.120
<v Speaker 3>about zits and it's about your zits are keeping you from being,</v>

541
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:59.300
<v Speaker 3>so you've got to ask your doctor about this medication that stops your zits.</v>

542
00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.790
<v Speaker 3>And then he goes through all the lists of shit.</v>

543
00:15:01.791 --> 00:15:04.440
<v Speaker 3>You should be careful of colluding,</v>

544
00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:06.410
<v Speaker 3>bloody diarrhea.</v>

545
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:08.300
<v Speaker 3>Oh my goodness is in the fucking commercial.</v>

546
00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:08.701
<v Speaker 3>And they're,</v>

547
00:15:08.701 --> 00:15:12.920
<v Speaker 3>they're saying you have to be careful of abdominal crank cramps because they</v>

548
00:15:12.921 --> 00:15:14.030
<v Speaker 3>could be fatal.</v>

549
00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:16.930
<v Speaker 3>You got to go to your doctor if any of these things happen.</v>

550
00:15:16.931 --> 00:15:17.450
<v Speaker 3>And I mean,</v>

551
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:22.070
<v Speaker 3>they've run through all fucking laundry list of shit that you have to be worried</v>

552
00:15:22.071 --> 00:15:22.550
<v Speaker 3>about.</v>

553
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:22.941
<v Speaker 3>Where I'm like,</v>

554
00:15:22.941 --> 00:15:24.320
<v Speaker 3>you gotta be fucking kidding me.</v>

555
00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:26.660
<v Speaker 3>This is real and this is on TV.</v>

556
00:15:26.661 --> 00:15:28.680
<v Speaker 3>And then they allowed them in your girls taking a narrow,</v>

557
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:32.570
<v Speaker 3>they manipulate you with the dancing and the pretty girls.</v>

558
00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:33.493
<v Speaker 3>This is the shit.</v>

559
00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.390
<v Speaker 3>We're not showing this to the rest of the world,</v>

560
00:15:35.391 --> 00:15:35.540
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

561
00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:36.020
<v Speaker 3>What's it called?</v>

562
00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:36.171
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

563
00:15:36.171 --> 00:15:37.190
<v Speaker 3>next dawn.</v>

564
00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:38.151
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

<v Speaker 3>so it's got these girls,</v>

566
00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:41.060
<v Speaker 3>they're beautiful.</v>

567
00:15:41.061 --> 00:15:42.620
<v Speaker 3>They're fucking flawless.</v>

568
00:15:42.890 --> 00:15:44.330
<v Speaker 3>They don't have a mark on their face.</v>

569
00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:47.180
<v Speaker 3>How come you can't get someone with zits that needs this shit?</v>

570
00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:52.590
<v Speaker 3>You've got these gorgeous model girls and while they're jogging down the street,</v>

571
00:15:52.641 --> 00:15:54.240
<v Speaker 3>this fucking happy song is playing.</v>

572
00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:56.570
<v Speaker 3>Do is dark.</v>

573
00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:59.990
<v Speaker 3>It's dark because dead eyes.</v>

574
00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:00.291
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

575
00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:00.800
<v Speaker 3>I was gonna say.</v>

576
00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:04.070
<v Speaker 3>And then an alien comes aboard and takes control of your life,</v>

577
00:16:04.130 --> 00:16:05.720
<v Speaker 3>but they're showing you the ideal.</v>

578
00:16:05.721 --> 00:16:08.720

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:45.150
<v Speaker 2>I was watching that commercial last night on TV during a hunting show.</v>

666
00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:46.171
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

673
00:18:54.570 --> 00:18:56.110
<v Speaker 2>I might be wrong about what I was watching on,</v>

674
00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:58.070
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't wrong about the,</v>

675
00:18:58.110 --> 00:19:01.440
<v Speaker 2>the actual commercial itself being insanity.</v>

676
00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:02.850
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

677
00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:06.660
<v Speaker 2>and the visuals and the sound track don't match at that moment and they're</v>

678
00:19:06.661 --> 00:19:07.590
<v Speaker 2>talking about bloody diarrhea.</v>

685
00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:24.570
<v Speaker 2>They're doing like they're brainwashing people.</v>

686
00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:25.610
<v Speaker 2>What's the actual number?</v>

687
00:19:25.650 --> 00:19:27.720

699
00:19:47.791 --> 00:19:49.230
<v Speaker 2>as long as the cars are safe,</v>

<v Speaker 2>like make it sex age,</v>

701
00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:52.750
<v Speaker 2>Judge Viper,</v>

703
00:19:54.751 --> 00:19:55.860
<v Speaker 2>coerce me in that way.</v>

704
00:19:55.861 --> 00:19:56.694
<v Speaker 2>That's fine.</v>

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.790
<v Speaker 2>I do mind that though of I might get bloody diarrhea.</v>

706
00:19:59.791 --> 00:20:00.624
<v Speaker 2>That kills me.</v>

707
00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:03.300
<v Speaker 2>You're coercing me.</v>

708
00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:04.850

<v Speaker 2>you're an outcast.</v>

711
00:20:10.291 --> 00:20:11.940
<v Speaker 2>And maybe if my skin was clear,</v>

712
00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.980
<v Speaker 2>then I wouldn't be scared to go to the gym.</v>

713
00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:14.370
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

714
00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:17.790
<v Speaker 2>maybe those girls at school would be nicer to me and I'd have more popular</v>

715
00:20:17.791 --> 00:20:18.120
<v Speaker 2>friends.</v>

716
00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:21.270
<v Speaker 2>And you see this fucking commercial and the next thing you know you're going to</v>

<v Speaker 2>you're dying.</v>

719
00:20:24.690 --> 00:20:26.490
<v Speaker 2>How would you get bloody diarrhea though?</v>

720
00:20:26.670 --> 00:20:28.200
<v Speaker 2>Cause it wouldn't be the only one way,</v>

721
00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:30.570
<v Speaker 2>but it wouldn't be bright,</v>

722
00:20:30.571 --> 00:20:30.751
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

723
00:20:30.751 --> 00:20:31.650
<v Speaker 2>It'd be like that black,</v>

724
00:20:31.651 --> 00:20:32.484
<v Speaker 2>red diarrhea,</v>

725
00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:33.300
<v Speaker 2>turnip,</v>

726
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.320
<v Speaker 2>dire situation,</v>

727
00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:35.710
<v Speaker 2>an acne medicine.</v>

728
00:20:35.711 --> 00:20:36.544
<v Speaker 2>It's giving you a journal.</v>

729
00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:38.340
<v Speaker 2>Da approved this,</v>

730
00:20:38.341 --> 00:20:40.830
<v Speaker 2>but knew that within a certain group,</v>

731
00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:41.281
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>

732
00:20:41.281 --> 00:20:42.270
<v Speaker 2>what a number is,</v>

733
00:20:42.271 --> 00:20:45.240
<v Speaker 2>whatever they feel the number of safe that many people out of that number,</v>

734
00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:49.180
<v Speaker 2>it's okay that they get these things as long as you say consult with your</v>

735
00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:49.541
<v Speaker 2>doctor,</v>

736
00:20:49.541 --> 00:20:49.870
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

737
00:20:49.870 --> 00:20:50.470
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

738
00:20:50.470 --> 00:20:53.260
<v Speaker 2>probably adheres to some code within the God.</v>

739
00:20:53.261 --> 00:20:54.190
<v Speaker 2>That's one of the situation.</v>

740
00:20:54.191 --> 00:20:55.360
<v Speaker 2>And I'll not jive really.</v>

741
00:20:55.361 --> 00:20:59.350
<v Speaker 2>One of the more fascinating things about us biologically is the fact that you</v>

742
00:20:59.351 --> 00:21:02.350
<v Speaker 2>could take something and it has no effect on you at all.</v>

743
00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:04.990
<v Speaker 2>And I can take the same thing and die like,</v>

744
00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:05.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

745
00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:10.470
<v Speaker 2>things that people are severely allergic to or allergic reactions,</v>

746
00:21:10.841 --> 00:21:11.680
<v Speaker 2>even to medication.</v>

747
00:21:11.681 --> 00:21:11.861
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

748
00:21:11.861 --> 00:21:14.350
<v Speaker 2>how many times do you ever been asked if you're allergic to penicillin?</v>

749
00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:17.800
<v Speaker 2>Imagine being the poor bastard that's allergic to penicillin.</v>

750
00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:18.850
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man.</v>

751
00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:19.960
<v Speaker 2>I could go be,</v>

752
00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:20.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

753
00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:20.740
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

754
00:21:20.740 --> 00:21:21.580
<v Speaker 2>one person,</v>

755
00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:22.270
<v Speaker 2>nothing.</v>

756
00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:23.280
<v Speaker 2>Net guy next to him.</v>

757
00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:24.190
<v Speaker 2>He'll die.</v>

758
00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:25.150
<v Speaker 2>I'm allergic to penicillin.</v>

759
00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:26.733
<v Speaker 2>Do you have to wear a little</v>

760
00:21:28.530 --> 00:21:29.040
<v Speaker 2>virgin?</v>

761
00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.370
<v Speaker 2>Being allergic to penicillin is a,</v>

762
00:21:30.371 --> 00:21:31.720
<v Speaker 2>you're allergic to all the ceilings.</v>

763
00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:33.220
<v Speaker 2>The mock is still in the stone,</v>

764
00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:33.960
<v Speaker 2>I said.</v>

765
00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.740
<v Speaker 2>And those are in other institutions?</v>

766
00:21:35.741 --> 00:21:36.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

767
00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:39.820
<v Speaker 2>so and I get strep throat a lot and like almost once a year.</v>

768
00:21:39.850 --> 00:21:41.680
<v Speaker 2>And so that normally you'd just take penicillin.</v>

769
00:21:41.870 --> 00:21:43.780
<v Speaker 2>I had no idea you were allergic to that.</v>

770
00:21:43.781 --> 00:21:44.570
<v Speaker 2>That's wild.</v>

771
00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:47.560
<v Speaker 2>And some with something that's not as effective.</v>

772
00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:49.480
<v Speaker 2>How did you find out?</v>

773
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:51.520
<v Speaker 2>Did you take penicillin or did they test you?</v>

774
00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:51.751
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

775
00:21:51.751 --> 00:21:55.630
<v Speaker 2>As a kid I took it and I broke up in this huge rash and stuff like that.</v>

776
00:21:55.631 --> 00:21:56.464
<v Speaker 2>And then could you agree?</v>

777
00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:00.430
<v Speaker 2>Could you breathe when you had that was fine breathing,</v>

778
00:22:00.431 --> 00:22:02.320
<v Speaker 2>but it was all over me.</v>

779
00:22:02.321 --> 00:22:03.970
<v Speaker 2>So it was pretty gross.</v>

780
00:22:03.971 --> 00:22:06.600
<v Speaker 2>But it was obvious it happened within a certain oh yeah.</v>

781
00:22:06.601 --> 00:22:07.510
<v Speaker 2>And it happened immediately.</v>

782
00:22:07.511 --> 00:22:08.344
<v Speaker 2>Oh my gosh.</v>

783
00:22:08.410 --> 00:22:09.243
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

784
00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:09.521
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

785
00:22:09.521 --> 00:22:10.354
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

786
00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:10.691
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

787
00:22:10.691 --> 00:22:11.524
<v Speaker 2>but you realize,</v>

788
00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:11.961
<v Speaker 2>eh,</v>

789
00:22:11.961 --> 00:22:13.210
<v Speaker 2>that before penicillin,</v>

790
00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:17.320
<v Speaker 2>the casualties in wars and stuff were off the charts.</v>

791
00:22:17.321 --> 00:22:21.180
<v Speaker 2>Like what does it world war one is when it gets invented because yeah,</v>

792
00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:26.170
<v Speaker 2>the lack of good antibiotics to treat any kind of post a wound infection or any</v>

793
00:22:26.171 --> 00:22:30.730
<v Speaker 2>kind of what terrifies me is how nature is trying to keep up with antibiotics.</v>

794
00:22:30.731 --> 00:22:33.310
<v Speaker 2>And they have these Murcia infections that people get where they are.</v>

795
00:22:33.310 --> 00:22:34.870
<v Speaker 2>They're hospitalized for months.</v>

796
00:22:35.170 --> 00:22:35.381
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

797
00:22:35.381 --> 00:22:37.390
<v Speaker 2>some people late catch Marissa,</v>

798
00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:40.240
<v Speaker 2>they get what mercy is like medication resistant staph,</v>

799
00:22:40.241 --> 00:22:41.074
<v Speaker 2>something another.</v>

800
00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:42.640
<v Speaker 2>I think that's what it stands for.</v>

801
00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:43.030
<v Speaker 2>But,</v>

802
00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:43.330
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

803
00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:43.660
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

804
00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:45.220
<v Speaker 2>it's particularly,</v>

805
00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:46.143
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

806
00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:47.351
<v Speaker 2>particularly,</v>

807
00:22:47.351 --> 00:22:47.630
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

808
00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:50.320
<v Speaker 2>common in surgery cases for some reason.</v>

809
00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:51.281
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

810
00:22:51.281 --> 00:22:52.360
<v Speaker 2>people have surgery.</v>

811
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:53.020
<v Speaker 2>What happened?</v>

812
00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:53.351
<v Speaker 2>Nothing.</v>

813
00:22:53.351 --> 00:22:55.030
<v Speaker 2>I just caught a look at myself on camera.</v>

814
00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:57.910
<v Speaker 2>That Gilead Cronenberg water buffalo hair.</v>

815
00:22:58.890 --> 00:23:00.180
<v Speaker 2>Someone sitting in the,</v>

816

<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>

817
00:23:00.761 --> 00:23:01.720
<v Speaker 2>Periscope chat.</v>

818
00:23:01.721 --> 00:23:02.820
<v Speaker 2>The of genius here.</v>

819
00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:04.390
<v Speaker 2>That's what I'm going for.</v>

820
00:23:04.391 --> 00:23:05.224
<v Speaker 2>A mad genius.</v>

821
00:23:05.230 --> 00:23:05.621
<v Speaker 2>Genius.</v>

<v Speaker 2>What the fuck?</v>

826
00:23:10.001 --> 00:23:11.640
<v Speaker 2>We were just talking about a Merva.</v>

827
00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:14.050
<v Speaker 2>They're being resistant to antibiotics.</v>

828
00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:19.210
<v Speaker 2>Murcia that scares the shit out of me that they're trying to get stronger as we</v>

829
00:23:19.211 --> 00:23:19.870
<v Speaker 2>make more.</v>

830
00:23:19.870 --> 00:23:19.991
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

831
00:23:19.991 --> 00:23:21.640
<v Speaker 2>it's almost like there's a war go like any bacteria.</v>

832
00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.360
<v Speaker 2>That's about it.</v>

833
00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:22.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

834

00:23:23.150 --> 00:23:23.520
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

836
00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:23.680
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

837
00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.450
<v Speaker 2>eventually those won't work well.</v>

838
00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:27.730
<v Speaker 2>Do you know some people that use them all the time?</v>

839
00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:32.290
<v Speaker 2>They get so crazy that they get the kill all the resistance in their hands to</v>

840
00:23:32.291 --> 00:23:35.320
<v Speaker 2>other bacteria so they get warts and shit all over their hands.</v>

841
00:23:35.321 --> 00:23:39.660
<v Speaker 2>It's like really common for people to become addicted to that stuff that Amy is</v>

842
00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:40.451
<v Speaker 2>not a bad idea.</v>

843
00:23:40.451 --> 00:23:44.480
<v Speaker 2>Every now and again to give yourself a little Antivia bacterial on the hands,</v>

844
00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.600
<v Speaker 2>stuff that Jay Gelb,</v>

845
00:23:47.601 --> 00:23:48.850
<v Speaker 2>it smells like the alcohol.</v>

846
00:23:48.851 --> 00:23:49.641
<v Speaker 2>It's gotta be good for you.</v>

847
00:23:49.641 --> 00:23:49.760
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

848
00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.593
<v Speaker 2>I like medicine,</v>

849
00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:51.710
<v Speaker 2>but some,</v>

850
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:54.740
<v Speaker 2>my friend went over to looked at a house and inside of the house was a closet</v>

851
00:23:54.741 --> 00:23:55.520
<v Speaker 2>full of the stuff.</v>

852
00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:56.090
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>

853
00:23:56.090 --> 00:23:56.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 2>they were going to buy this house.</v>

855
00:23:57.441 --> 00:23:59.420
<v Speaker 2>They went and looked in the house and they opened this door and there was a</v>

856
00:23:59.421 --> 00:24:04.340
<v Speaker 2>fucking closet fill with one hand sanitizer.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Just bottles and bottles and bottles and bottles.</v>

858
00:24:06.670 --> 00:24:10.730
<v Speaker 2>Like a crazy person was terrified of running out of hand sanitizer.</v>

859
00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:13.100
<v Speaker 2>It's been a godsend for Germaphobes.</v>

860
00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:13.611
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

865
00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:22.250
<v Speaker 2>like that's a psychological thing,</v>

866
00:24:22.251 --> 00:24:22.730
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

867
00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:24.320
<v Speaker 2>It's like odd or what did they call it?</v>

868
00:24:24.321 --> 00:24:25.130
<v Speaker 2>OCD.</v>

869
00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:25.491
<v Speaker 2>OCD.</v>

870
00:24:25.491 --> 00:24:26.230
<v Speaker 2>Not Ocd.</v>

871
00:24:26.230 --> 00:24:28.400
<v Speaker 2>So don't you think that that almost like fuels it?</v>

872
00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:29.520
<v Speaker 2>Like having,</v>

873
00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:30.681
<v Speaker 2>that's what I mean,</v>

874
00:24:30.681 --> 00:24:31.170
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

875
00:24:31.170 --> 00:24:34.490
<v Speaker 2>it's absolutely being validated that the thing you're afraid of is true.</v>

876
00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:35.690
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

877
00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:37.400
<v Speaker 2>I'm afraid of touching anything or touch anything.</v>

878
00:24:37.580 --> 00:24:38.060
<v Speaker 2>Like I,</v>

879
00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:39.190
<v Speaker 2>when I do my podcast,</v>

880
00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:43.010
<v Speaker 2>I talked to everyone in the audience before the show for a while and I shake</v>

881
00:24:43.011 --> 00:24:43.760
<v Speaker 2>everybody's hand.</v>

882
00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:47.630
<v Speaker 2>So I'm communicating whatever disease anyone's giving me to everyone and I don't</v>

883
00:24:47.631 --> 00:24:48.500
<v Speaker 2>use hand sanitizer.</v>

884
00:24:48.501 --> 00:24:52.190
<v Speaker 2>I'll go in the restroom and wash my hands after that and then start the show.</v>

885
00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:54.980
<v Speaker 2>But we all have to take that chance.</v>

886
00:24:54.981 --> 00:24:58.040
<v Speaker 2>We're all humans and live with each other and it's good for your immune system</v>

887
00:24:58.041 --> 00:24:59.000
<v Speaker 2>tied to lie.</v>

888
00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:02.210
<v Speaker 2>I've never gotten sick from it and I'm never nothing bad.</v>

889
00:25:02.211 --> 00:25:03.550
<v Speaker 2>Don't go look in your hands though.</v>

890
00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:04.541
<v Speaker 2>Like I say,</v>

891
00:25:04.541 --> 00:25:05.720
<v Speaker 2>I'll wash my hands after the shell.</v>

892
00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:06.500
<v Speaker 2>I did not.</v>

893
00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:07.010
<v Speaker 2>I did not,</v>

894
00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:07.460
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

895
00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:09.170
<v Speaker 2>pleasure myself or dance around her.</v>

896
00:25:09.171 --> 00:25:09.950
<v Speaker 2>Make a Taco or it.</v>

897
00:25:09.950 --> 00:25:12.200
<v Speaker 2>And how is it that this is a concern?</v>

898
00:25:12.201 --> 00:25:14.810
<v Speaker 2>Just think about the actual existence of human beings.</v>

899
00:25:14.811 --> 00:25:19.520
<v Speaker 2>How bizarre is it that there's a concern that you might get an organism that's</v>

900
00:25:19.521 --> 00:25:21.350
<v Speaker 2>attached to another person?</v>

901
00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:26.550
<v Speaker 2>That organism will threaten the very ecosystem that your life depends on.</v>

902
00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:28.431
<v Speaker 2>That's real.</v>

903
00:25:28.431 --> 00:25:29.750
<v Speaker 2>Like that's how people get colds.</v>

904
00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:30.200
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

905
00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.360
<v Speaker 2>you're rubbing up against an organism.</v>

906
00:25:32.361 --> 00:25:36.920
<v Speaker 2>You get it in your body because it came off of someone else's body and it may or</v>

907
00:25:36.921 --> 00:25:37.754
<v Speaker 2>may not kill you.</v>

908
00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:38.930
<v Speaker 2>And I like the flu.</v>

909
00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:42.980
<v Speaker 2>How many times have you shaken all these hands after a show and then fingered a</v>

910
00:25:42.981 --> 00:25:46.590
<v Speaker 2>girl without washing your hands and now that I'm in ducks,</v>

911
00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:47.421
<v Speaker 2>that goes without saying,</v>

912
00:25:47.421 --> 00:25:49.850
<v Speaker 2>but I think everyone can relate to that.</v>

913
00:25:49.870 --> 00:25:50.703
<v Speaker 2>Brian.</v>

914
00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:51.020
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

915
00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:53.330
<v Speaker 2>I wash my hands after shows.</v>

916
00:25:53.390 --> 00:25:53.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

917
00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:55.670
<v Speaker 2>I washed my hands and also we,</v>

918
00:25:55.671 --> 00:25:56.390
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

919
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:57.470
<v Speaker 2>I don't think about it that much,</v>

920
00:25:57.471 --> 00:25:58.550
<v Speaker 2>but now that we're on the subject,</v>

921
00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:01.910
<v Speaker 2>the microphone never gets cleaned off like a gym.</v>

922
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.600
<v Speaker 2>You would never touch equipment that didn't.</v>

923
00:26:03.601 --> 00:26:05.630
<v Speaker 2>We occasionally get something like show your face,</v>

924
00:26:05.631 --> 00:26:07.010
<v Speaker 2>you kind of kiss it sometimes.</v>

925
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:10.070
<v Speaker 2>How many times do you accidentally put your mouth or you're making it sound</v>

926
00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:12.750
<v Speaker 2>effecting your and your your sucks.</v>

927
00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:14.450
<v Speaker 2>And I get the most who's face,</v>

928
00:26:14.690 --> 00:26:16.370
<v Speaker 2>I get it all up in the Mike all the time.</v>

929
00:26:16.371 --> 00:26:17.070
<v Speaker 2>And Jill,</v>

930
00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:20.930
<v Speaker 2>you know and like you're sterilize I think never touched him with alcohol and</v>

931
00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:21.740
<v Speaker 2>really they should.</v>

932
00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:22.020
<v Speaker 2>We not,</v>

933
00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:23.000
<v Speaker 2>now that I think about it,</v>

934
00:26:23.001 --> 00:26:23.834
<v Speaker 2>maybe this guy's thing,</v>

935
00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.630
<v Speaker 2>maybe I'll go Todd glass on everyone and have them change the lighting and</v>

936
00:26:26.631 --> 00:26:27.241
<v Speaker 2>sterilize.</v>

937
00:26:27.241 --> 00:26:31.290
<v Speaker 2>The worst case scenario is these things and he's foam thing.</v>

938
00:26:31.610 --> 00:26:35.050
<v Speaker 2>This is just a receptical we're spitting into that fucking thing and there's</v>

939
00:26:35.051 --> 00:26:37.490
<v Speaker 2>like growing all kinds of weird funky shit.</v>

940
00:26:37.491 --> 00:26:40.550
<v Speaker 2>I bet if we had a microphone and we looked at what's actually going on in the</v>

941
00:26:40.551 --> 00:26:41.660
<v Speaker 2>foam of this microphone,</v>

942
00:26:41.661 --> 00:26:43.070
<v Speaker 2>I suppose we'd be fucking terrified.</v>

943
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:43.440
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

944
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:43.980
<v Speaker 2>It'd be like</v>

945
00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.180
<v Speaker 1>the clouds of Venus or whatever.</v>

946
00:26:45.181 --> 00:26:46.800
<v Speaker 1>There'd be every manner of thing growing in there.</v>

947
00:26:46.801 --> 00:26:47.470
<v Speaker 1>That'd be pretty cool.</v>

948
00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:48.720
<v Speaker 1>Taking all that DNA though.</v>

949
00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:51.740
<v Speaker 1>You know how many people have talked into that microphone and David Lee Roth?</v>

950
00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:53.540
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

951
00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:54.480
<v Speaker 1>I wonder how,</v>

952
00:26:54.570 --> 00:26:55.800
<v Speaker 1>how long does that stick around?</v>

953
00:26:57.090 --> 00:26:57.660
<v Speaker 1>Forever.</v>

954
00:26:57.660 --> 00:26:58.493
<v Speaker 1>That's fine.</v>

955
00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.460
<v Speaker 1>I think like for like spit,</v>

956
00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:03.930
<v Speaker 1>it's gotta be pretty fresh.</v>

957
00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.700
<v Speaker 1>You can't use a hundred year old spit.</v>

958
00:27:05.910 --> 00:27:06.151
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

959
00:27:06.151 --> 00:27:06.361
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

960
00:27:06.361 --> 00:27:08.880
<v Speaker 1>if somebody's sucked on a flute a hundred years ago,</v>

961
00:27:09.090 --> 00:27:10.310
<v Speaker 1>I really doubt that.</v>

962
00:27:10.311 --> 00:27:11.700
<v Speaker 1>Go and get some DNA off.</v>

963
00:27:11.701 --> 00:27:13.410
<v Speaker 1>That's a good question and I can't answer it,</v>

964
00:27:13.411 --> 00:27:15.960
<v Speaker 1>but I want it off what you're just saying.</v>

965
00:27:16.660 --> 00:27:20.430
<v Speaker 1>I was in Philly like a year or two ago and I went to independence hall.</v>

966
00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:20.760
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

967
00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:24.510
<v Speaker 1>And they got the several drafts of the declaration of independence,</v>

968
00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:30.010
<v Speaker 1>the pre drafts before the one that we all know and it says on the explanation on</v>

969
00:27:30.421 --> 00:27:31.254
<v Speaker 1>the wall,</v>

970
00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:31.950
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>

971
00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:36.510
<v Speaker 1>George w a Benjamin Franklin and George Washington is sweat and DNA is all over</v>

972
00:27:36.511 --> 00:27:39.840
<v Speaker 1>this because they were like this over it with pans writing.</v>

973
00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:44.340
<v Speaker 1>And so I wonder if the spit lasts because they were according to this,</v>

974
00:27:44.341 --> 00:27:48.630
<v Speaker 1>it's like them touching it and their hair landing on it and then sweating on it</v>

975
00:27:48.631 --> 00:27:49.500
<v Speaker 1>was enough to,</v>

976
00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.150
<v Speaker 1>you could extract.</v>

977
00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:54.610
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely DNA in the future if it hasn't been created yet.</v>

978
00:27:54.690 --> 00:27:54.950
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

979
00:27:54.950 --> 00:27:56.460
<v Speaker 1>If we can't pick it up now.</v>

980
00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:57.343
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

981
00:27:57.430 --> 00:27:59.820
<v Speaker 1>Whether it would be a whole read out of them,</v>

982
00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:00.161
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

983
00:28:00.161 --> 00:28:05.161
<v Speaker 1>and we'll come a complete DNA molecule or whether it would just be some of it,</v>

984
00:28:05.641 --> 00:28:06.270
<v Speaker 1>I dunno.</v>

985
00:28:06.270 --> 00:28:07.020
<v Speaker 1>But they were like,</v>

986
00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:09.450
<v Speaker 1>oh Benjamin Franklins Dnas all over this.</v>

987
00:28:09.451 --> 00:28:10.350
<v Speaker 1>Then like literally,</v>

988
00:28:10.351 --> 00:28:11.030
<v Speaker 1>and I was like,</v>

989
00:28:11.030 --> 00:28:13.710
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of exciting to think about them just sitting there going,</v>

990
00:28:13.711 --> 00:28:15.370
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to win in the court.</v>

991
00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:16.390
<v Speaker 1>How do you spell you know,</v>

992
00:28:16.410 --> 00:28:17.250
<v Speaker 1>course and you know,</v>

993
00:28:17.251 --> 00:28:21.480
<v Speaker 1>match cause there's all these scratch outs on it and ink and I'm touching it and</v>

994
00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:23.130
<v Speaker 1>poor wiping techniques.</v>

995
00:28:23.490 --> 00:28:25.270
<v Speaker 1>Well like that they didn't know hygiene.</v>

996
00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.420
<v Speaker 1>The thing I think about when you look at the old even brush,</v>

997
00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:27.720
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

998
00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.010
<v Speaker 1>the thing about old paintings,</v>

999
00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:29.640
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1000
00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.450
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

1001
00:28:30.450 --> 00:28:32.880
<v Speaker 1>is you know that someone's,</v>

1002
00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:33.391
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1003
00:28:33.391 --> 00:28:38.250
<v Speaker 1>the physical act of that's always that to me that brings the pass back</v>

1004
00:28:38.251 --> 00:28:38.761
<v Speaker 1>instantly.</v>

1005
00:28:38.761 --> 00:28:40.290
<v Speaker 1>Cause it's like the genuine article.</v>

1006
00:28:40.291 --> 00:28:42.210
<v Speaker 1>If someone made a painting 500 years ago,</v>

1007
00:28:42.211 --> 00:28:43.590
<v Speaker 1>like you see a Davinci or something,</v>

1008
00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:45.000
<v Speaker 1>he certainly went,</v>

1009
00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:46.613
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1010
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:48.120
<v Speaker 1>and had paint on his face and,</v>

1011
00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:50.970
<v Speaker 1>and touch you with his hands and put the brushes and you know,</v>

1012
00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:53.280
<v Speaker 1>got up to it and I stood back from it.</v>

1013
00:28:53.281 --> 00:28:54.060
<v Speaker 1>And then,</v>

1014
00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:54.600
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1015
00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:57.810
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing the completed article but the process that went into it is like</v>

1016
00:28:57.811 --> 00:28:59.190
<v Speaker 1>any plastic cart.</v>

1017
00:28:59.910 --> 00:29:00.211
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1018
00:29:00.211 --> 00:29:02.880
<v Speaker 1>It isn't the immediacy of them making it,</v>

1019
00:29:03.450 --> 00:29:08.450
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of fascinating how once you give something a name like Dna and it</v>

1020
00:29:08.851 --> 00:29:11.490
<v Speaker 1>becomes a normal part of your discussion,</v>

1021
00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:12.440
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

1022
00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:12.960
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

1023
00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:17.010
<v Speaker 1>you kind of forget how crazy.</v>

1024
00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:22.220
<v Speaker 1>Just being able to lick something and leave fucking DNA is the idea that your a</v>

1025
00:29:23.850 --> 00:29:24.361
<v Speaker 1>stamp,</v>

1026
00:29:24.361 --> 00:29:29.361
<v Speaker 1>like you're sending a bill and you lick it and you see that stamp that has your</v>

1027
00:29:29.401 --> 00:29:34.401
<v Speaker 1>fucking genetic markers on it and they can identify you really well,</v>

1028
00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:37.410
<v Speaker 1>like down to like in the high nine days,</v>

1029
00:29:37.411 --> 00:29:38.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1030
00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:42.550
<v Speaker 1>It's like not a hundred but we know it's you bitch and they take these fucking,</v>

1031
00:29:42.610 --> 00:29:46.300
<v Speaker 3>these saliva samples and all sorts of different samples.</v>

1032
00:29:46.301 --> 00:29:48.850
<v Speaker 3>They can get DNA off of skin hair,</v>

1033
00:29:48.910 --> 00:29:49.840
<v Speaker 3>but did she get it?</v>

1034
00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:51.010
<v Speaker 3>But here's the hair thing.</v>

1035
00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.001
<v Speaker 3>Did you hear that?</v>

1036
00:29:52.001 --> 00:29:53.110
<v Speaker 3>The hair science,</v>

1037
00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:55.870
<v Speaker 3>like there's a good percentage of it is bullshit.</v>

1038
00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:56.091
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1039
00:29:56.091 --> 00:30:01.091
<v Speaker 3>Was actually invented by the FBI and responsible for hundreds of convictions</v>

1040
00:30:03.010 --> 00:30:06.520
<v Speaker 3>where the doctors like war fucking lab coat and said,</v>

1041
00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:09.430
<v Speaker 3>without a doubt 100% of these came from the same person or it's,</v>

1042
00:30:09.470 --> 00:30:09.590
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

1043
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:11.800
<v Speaker 3>it goes back 20 years since they started the program.</v>

1044
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:12.960
<v Speaker 3>I read about it last weekend.</v>

1045
00:30:13.010 --> 00:30:13.900
<v Speaker 3>Scandalous.</v>

1046
00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:15.520
<v Speaker 3>It's not just scandalous.</v>

1047
00:30:15.521 --> 00:30:16.750
<v Speaker 3>It's horrific.</v>

1048
00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.280
<v Speaker 3>People were put to death.</v>

1049
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:18.461
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1050
00:30:18.461 --> 00:30:21.040
<v Speaker 3>They were people who were put to death for crimes.</v>

1051
00:30:21.041 --> 00:30:24.670
<v Speaker 3>Who the fuck knows if they were guilty or weren't guilty?</v>

1052
00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:28.300
<v Speaker 3>But if the tipping point was this hair thing,</v>

1053
00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:30.280
<v Speaker 3>that's gotta be murder,</v>

1054
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:30.660
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

1055
00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:31.420
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1056
00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:33.090
<v Speaker 3>That's merge the state murdering pits.</v>

1057
00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:34.180
<v Speaker 3>That's murder.</v>

1058
00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:34.960
<v Speaker 3>Why can't,</v>

1059
00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.460
<v Speaker 3>why can't we charge them with murder?</v>

1060
00:30:36.461 --> 00:30:37.001
<v Speaker 3>Will we try?</v>

1061
00:30:37.001 --> 00:30:38.610
<v Speaker 3>You think anything will come of it?</v>

1062
00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:39.090
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1063
00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:40.180
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a shit storm.</v>

1064
00:30:40.181 --> 00:30:42.010
<v Speaker 3>It went away right after I first saw it.</v>

1065
00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:42.570
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

1066
00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:45.700
<v Speaker 3>but that's definitely the kind of thing you have hearings about.</v>

1067
00:30:45.701 --> 00:30:46.270
<v Speaker 3>I think,</v>

1068
00:30:46.270 --> 00:30:48.100
<v Speaker 3>you know what [inaudible] programs,</v>

1069
00:30:48.101 --> 00:30:48.730
<v Speaker 3>things like that.</v>

1070
00:30:48.730 --> 00:30:52.470
<v Speaker 3>There's a fundamental huge flaw in the system and the one,</v>

1071
00:30:52.471 --> 00:30:52.620
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1072
00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:56.290
<v Speaker 3>the fucking fundamental flaw of the justice system is there's winning and</v>

1073
00:30:56.291 --> 00:30:57.124
<v Speaker 3>losing.</v>

1074
00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:00.250
<v Speaker 3>And when people get involved in winning and losing,</v>

1075
00:31:00.490 --> 00:31:01.360
<v Speaker 3>they cheat.</v>

1076
00:31:01.390 --> 00:31:02.141
<v Speaker 3>They lie,</v>

1077
00:31:02.141 --> 00:31:02.920
<v Speaker 3>they steal,</v>

1078
00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:06.490
<v Speaker 3>they want to win because winning becomes more important than anything else,</v>

1079
00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:07.720
<v Speaker 3>especially the good guys.</v>

1080
00:31:07.721 --> 00:31:08.920
<v Speaker 3>Because the good guys want to win.</v>

1081
00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:13.950
<v Speaker 3>Winning becomes more important than even justice and truth because along the way</v>

1082
00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:15.543
<v Speaker 3>they develop,</v>

1083
00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:17.980
<v Speaker 3>they develop this attitude like,</v>

1084
00:31:17.981 --> 00:31:18.271
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

1085
00:31:18.271 --> 00:31:19.270
<v Speaker 3>if I'm going after them,</v>

1086
00:31:19.271 --> 00:31:20.950
<v Speaker 3>they're already fucking guilty of something else.</v>

1087
00:31:22.090 --> 00:31:22.990
<v Speaker 3>I know who's guilty,</v>

1088
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:27.040
<v Speaker 3>especially when they're dealing with like young kids that might have fucked up a</v>

1089
00:31:27.041 --> 00:31:27.750
<v Speaker 3>few times,</v>

1090
00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:28.770
<v Speaker 3>been to juvenile home.</v>

1091
00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:29.590
<v Speaker 3>I went to jail.</v>

1092
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:30.160
<v Speaker 3>Like they'll,</v>

1093
00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:33.040
<v Speaker 3>they will literally cause crimes like,</v>

1094
00:31:33.170 --> 00:31:37.570
<v Speaker 3>but give people sentences that they don't deserve.</v>

1095
00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:40.450
<v Speaker 3>Lock them up with fucking planted evidence.</v>

1096
00:31:40.451 --> 00:31:41.284
<v Speaker 3>Like this is not,</v>

1097
00:31:41.530 --> 00:31:44.220
<v Speaker 3>it's not an uncommon thing that only existed in a movie.</v>

1098
00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:45.390
<v Speaker 3>If we saw it in real life,</v>

1099
00:31:45.391 --> 00:31:45.730
<v Speaker 3>you'd be like,</v>

1100
00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:46.720
<v Speaker 3>oh right.</v>

1101
00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:51.040
<v Speaker 3>If we saw someone planting a gun on a murder suspect or a a murder victim,</v>

1102
00:31:51.370 --> 00:31:52.750
<v Speaker 3>we wouldn't even think twice.</v>

1103
00:31:52.751 --> 00:31:53.051
<v Speaker 3>We would like,</v>

1104
00:31:53.051 --> 00:31:53.884
<v Speaker 3>of course they did it.</v>

1105
00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:54.911
<v Speaker 3>These people do this.</v>

1106
00:31:54.911 --> 00:31:55.960
<v Speaker 3>Sometimes it's not.</v>

1107
00:31:55.961 --> 00:31:59.380
<v Speaker 3>And everyone who becomes a cop is just the one thing that everyone who becomes a</v>

1108
00:31:59.381 --> 00:32:02.260
<v Speaker 3>cop has in common is they're all people.</v>

1109
00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:02.950
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1110
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:03.820
<v Speaker 3>that's still one thing.</v>

1111
00:32:03.821 --> 00:32:08.770
<v Speaker 3>And so that alone would let you believe that most people should never be fucking</v>

1112
00:32:08.771 --> 00:32:09.460
<v Speaker 3>cops.</v>

1113
00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:09.831
<v Speaker 3>Like dump.</v>

1114
00:32:09.831 --> 00:32:13.870
<v Speaker 3>The vast majority of people should never be trusted with that kind of</v>

1115
00:32:13.871 --> 00:32:14.590
<v Speaker 3>responsibility.</v>

1116
00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:15.520
<v Speaker 3>No Way.</v>

1117
00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:18.370
<v Speaker 3>That kind of power and then when that gets a B is like,</v>

1118
00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:18.661
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1119
00:32:18.661 --> 00:32:20.210
<v Speaker 3>now we've seen that the,</v>

1120
00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:20.530
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1121
00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:21.490
<v Speaker 3>the last six months,</v>

1122
00:32:21.570 --> 00:32:23.890
<v Speaker 3>last two days that the,</v>

1123
00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:25.240
<v Speaker 3>the police state,</v>

1124
00:32:25.241 --> 00:32:26.290
<v Speaker 3>the overfunding,</v>

1125
00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:27.760
<v Speaker 3>the militarization,</v>

1126
00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:32.020
<v Speaker 3>the absolute lack of code when it comes to black people or the underclass.</v>

1127
00:32:32.290 --> 00:32:32.770
<v Speaker 3>And then,</v>

1128
00:32:32.770 --> 00:32:34.000
<v Speaker 3>then it just piles up,</v>

1129
00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:34.300
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1130
00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:34.810
<v Speaker 3>then the,</v>

1131
00:32:34.810 --> 00:32:38.380
<v Speaker 3>now we see it though more and more now we're highly keenly tuned into it,</v>

1132
00:32:38.410 --> 00:32:39.170
<v Speaker 3>especially,</v>

1133
00:32:39.170 --> 00:32:39.530
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

1134
00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:40.160
<v Speaker 3>Walter Scott</v>

1135
00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:44.210
<v Speaker 2>got aced on video phone horribly a couple of weeks ago.</v>

1136
00:32:44.211 --> 00:32:45.000
<v Speaker 2>But what is that?</v>

1137
00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:45.530
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

1138
00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:45.920
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

1139
00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:46.581
<v Speaker 2>the guy in,</v>

1140
00:32:46.581 --> 00:32:47.030
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1141
00:32:47.030 --> 00:32:48.020
<v Speaker 2>which town was it in?</v>

1142
00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.550
<v Speaker 2>Walter Scott and from her,</v>

1143
00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:50.511
<v Speaker 2>it's on the video,</v>

1144
00:32:50.511 --> 00:32:53.100
<v Speaker 2>you see the cop put slugs and the guy who got shot,</v>

1145
00:32:53.101 --> 00:32:54.200
<v Speaker 2>it was running away a bit.</v>

1146
00:32:54.210 --> 00:32:55.080
<v Speaker 2>She had a pork.</v>

1147
00:32:55.290 --> 00:32:56.390
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

1148
00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:59.630
<v Speaker 2>So like now we're real acutely aware that cops,</v>

1149
00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:00.410
<v Speaker 2>like you say,</v>

1150
00:33:00.410 --> 00:33:05.060
<v Speaker 2>our people and panic sheet people go crazy with the use their situation they're</v>

1151
00:33:05.061 --> 00:33:05.330
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

1152
00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:08.510
<v Speaker 2>They develop personal animosity for this person they're trying to take out</v>

1153
00:33:08.511 --> 00:33:09.830
<v Speaker 2>because it becomes a competition,</v>

1154
00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.840
<v Speaker 2>becomes a competition of arresting them.</v>

1155
00:33:11.841 --> 00:33:13.700
<v Speaker 2>Then it becomes a competition of convicting them.</v>

1156
00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:17.990
<v Speaker 2>It becomes us against them and even if you're a great guy and you're the perfect</v>

1157
00:33:17.991 --> 00:33:18.980
<v Speaker 2>guy for being a cop,</v>

1158
00:33:19.190 --> 00:33:24.080
<v Speaker 2>you always have to be on guard of some fucking asshole trying to shoot you or</v>

1159
00:33:24.081 --> 00:33:25.170
<v Speaker 2>jumping on you and punchy.</v>

1160
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:26.420
<v Speaker 2>When you're arresting people,</v>

1161
00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:31.340
<v Speaker 2>you have to always be on your complete red alert because we've all seen those</v>

1162
00:33:31.341 --> 00:33:35.420
<v Speaker 2>videos of cops that were like pulling people over and then they got shot or</v>

1163
00:33:35.421 --> 00:33:36.260
<v Speaker 2>pulling people over it.</v>

1164
00:33:36.270 --> 00:33:39.230
<v Speaker 2>They've seen the one where the woman pulls the guy over and the guy beats the</v>

1165
00:33:39.231 --> 00:33:42.570
<v Speaker 2>shit out of the woman in front of his daughter and his daughter's screen</v>

1166
00:33:42.571 --> 00:33:43.010
<v Speaker 2>stopped.</v>

1167
00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:43.843
<v Speaker 2>Daddy stopped.</v>

1168
00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.890
<v Speaker 2>He knocks her out and beats the shit out of her.</v>

1169
00:33:45.891 --> 00:33:46.850
<v Speaker 2>When she's unconscious,</v>

1170
00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:48.380
<v Speaker 2>it's horrific.</v>

1171
00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:49.581
<v Speaker 2>It just shows you,</v>

1172
00:33:49.581 --> 00:33:50.414
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>

1173
00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:54.440
<v Speaker 2>you can't have a lone woman by herself in that scenario.</v>

1174
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.681
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

1175
00:33:54.681 --> 00:33:54.981
<v Speaker 2>we all,</v>

1176
00:33:54.981 --> 00:33:57.050
<v Speaker 2>everyone wants to believe in equal rights.</v>

1177
00:33:57.220 --> 00:33:58.053
<v Speaker 2>The,</v>

1178
00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:01.610
<v Speaker 2>there's no physical equality that just doesn't exist.</v>

1179
00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:04.120
<v Speaker 2>And if you're going to be a woman and you're going to be in a situation where</v>

1180
00:34:04.130 --> 00:34:06.170
<v Speaker 2>you have to arrest a big physical man,</v>

1181
00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:09.470
<v Speaker 2>you can't let them get anywhere near you ever can't let them get it anywhere in</v>

1182
00:34:09.471 --> 00:34:09.590
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

1183
00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:10.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1184
00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:10.431
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1185
00:34:10.431 --> 00:34:10.671
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

1186
00:34:10.671 --> 00:34:14.060
<v Speaker 2>you have to make sure that everybody that's around you,</v>

1187
00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:15.800
<v Speaker 2>whether it's a other cops are,</v>

1188
00:34:15.890 --> 00:34:16.830
<v Speaker 2>they know what's going on.</v>

1189
00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:20.580
<v Speaker 2>They know where you are right now because it's highly likely that this guy's</v>

1190
00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:23.540
<v Speaker 2>gonna make an irrational decision to just beat the fuck out of you.</v>

1191
00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:25.550
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't get to your gun and time,</v>

1192
00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:26.473
<v Speaker 2>you're done.</v>

1193
00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:28.040
<v Speaker 2>And that's the case with men too.</v>

1194
00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:30.590
<v Speaker 2>So those men have to constantly be worried about it.</v>

1195
00:34:30.591 --> 00:34:31.580
<v Speaker 2>They was the constantly,</v>

1196
00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:32.160
<v Speaker 2>when they're,</v>

1197
00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:32.720
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>

1198
00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:35.360
<v Speaker 2>they're always fucking freaking out and tense.</v>

1199
00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:37.430
<v Speaker 2>It's almost a job that no one can do.</v>

1200
00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:38.511
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1201
00:34:38.511 --> 00:34:38.871
<v Speaker 2>how do you,</v>

1202
00:34:38.871 --> 00:34:40.270
<v Speaker 2>how do you do it every day and,</v>

1203
00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:41.990
<v Speaker 2>and measure the justice every day.</v>

1204
00:34:41.991 --> 00:34:45.860
<v Speaker 2>And then when you see how shit the system is and when you see how even the</v>

1205
00:34:45.861 --> 00:34:49.820
<v Speaker 2>people you are arresting and they have to live amongst their life's not so hot</v>

1206
00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:50.600
<v Speaker 2>and you know what I mean?</v>

1207
00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:51.830
<v Speaker 2>You'll either find out of you're arresting,</v>

1208
00:34:51.831 --> 00:34:54.080
<v Speaker 2>you should feel sorry for her at both ends of the spectrum.</v>

1209
00:34:54.081 --> 00:34:55.250
<v Speaker 2>Because on the one hand,</v>

1210
00:34:55.251 --> 00:34:56.900
<v Speaker 2>like when you saw that Ferguson report,</v>

1211
00:34:57.140 --> 00:35:00.620
<v Speaker 2>the mandate from the city was you go out and you'd get those fines because</v>

1212
00:35:00.621 --> 00:35:01.101
<v Speaker 2>that's how,</v>

1213
00:35:01.101 --> 00:35:02.930
<v Speaker 2>that's how we generate income in this town.</v>

1214
00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:04.160
<v Speaker 2>You go out and arrest people,</v>

1215
00:35:04.161 --> 00:35:06.050
<v Speaker 2>you pull people over for license plates,</v>

1216
00:35:06.051 --> 00:35:06.884
<v Speaker 2>lights,</v>

1217
00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:08.300
<v Speaker 2>any old miner it for being black,</v>

1218
00:35:08.301 --> 00:35:08.931
<v Speaker 2>just whatever.</v>

1219
00:35:08.931 --> 00:35:10.220
<v Speaker 2>You just make that happen.</v>

1220
00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:14.570
<v Speaker 2>And so in the report at said they were getting pressured to be those kinds of</v>

1221
00:35:14.571 --> 00:35:17.000
<v Speaker 2>cops that had to just minor infractions where,</v>

1222
00:35:17.001 --> 00:35:18.190
<v Speaker 2>how the city was making his money.</v>

1223
00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:20.060
<v Speaker 2>That's so crazy.</v>

1224
00:35:20.061 --> 00:35:23.990
<v Speaker 2>That's a completed version of how we perceive what the police were supposed to</v>

1225
00:35:23.991 --> 00:35:26.150
<v Speaker 2>do because we're paying the taxes,</v>

1226
00:35:26.151 --> 00:35:26.291
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

1227
00:35:26.291 --> 00:35:26.411
<v Speaker 2>blah,</v>

1228
00:35:26.411 --> 00:35:26.561
<v Speaker 2>blah.</v>

1229
00:35:26.561 --> 00:35:28.700
<v Speaker 2>So glorified revenue collecting.</v>

1230
00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:29.121
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

1231
00:35:29.121 --> 00:35:29.690
<v Speaker 2>and that,</v>

1232
00:35:29.690 --> 00:35:32.070
<v Speaker 2>but that puts something on them that they didn't sign it.</v>

1233
00:35:32.071 --> 00:35:32.720
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

1234
00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:33.321
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

1235
00:35:33.321 --> 00:35:36.440
<v Speaker 2>Like when the troops have to defend money,</v>

1236
00:35:36.441 --> 00:35:38.040
<v Speaker 2>positions and interests for our</v>

1237
00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:38.521
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

1238
00:35:38.521 --> 00:35:39.900
<v Speaker 1>that's when I get huffy.</v>

1239
00:35:39.901 --> 00:35:41.040
<v Speaker 1>You know like people are like,</v>

1240
00:35:41.041 --> 00:35:41.471
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

1241
00:35:41.471 --> 00:35:42.241
<v Speaker 1>he should be for the troops.</v>

1242
00:35:42.241 --> 00:35:42.451
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

1243
00:35:42.451 --> 00:35:43.350
<v Speaker 1>I'm all for the chiefs.</v>

1244
00:35:43.351 --> 00:35:47.640
<v Speaker 1>You put them in poisonous danger with shit that's not tested or know a body</v>

1245
00:35:47.641 --> 00:35:52.641
<v Speaker 1>armor or poorly armored vehicles that get blown up by iads and stuff and that's</v>

1246
00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:54.263
<v Speaker 1>our fault.</v>

1247
00:35:54.330 --> 00:35:55.021
<v Speaker 1>You know what I mean?</v>

1248
00:35:55.021 --> 00:35:55.740
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>

1249
00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:59.280
<v Speaker 1>that's the government being malfeasant and not protecting the people.</v>

1250
00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:02.520
<v Speaker 1>It's asking them to do something that's more than you signed up.</v>

1251
00:36:02.521 --> 00:36:04.200
<v Speaker 1>Now imagine if the cops,</v>

1252
00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:06.780
<v Speaker 1>the soldiers rather also how to write tickets.</v>

1253
00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:08.940
<v Speaker 1>They had to collect money from an essence they here,</v>

1254
00:36:08.941 --> 00:36:09.570
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

1255
00:36:09.570 --> 00:36:10.560
<v Speaker 1>They didn't essence they do,</v>

1256
00:36:10.561 --> 00:36:14.400
<v Speaker 1>but you can imagine they also have to deliver money situation where not only did</v>

1257
00:36:14.401 --> 00:36:15.720
<v Speaker 1>they have to go and fight wars,</v>

1258
00:36:15.721 --> 00:36:17.130
<v Speaker 1>but they also had the ticket.</v>

1259
00:36:17.131 --> 00:36:18.210
<v Speaker 1>These people pull over.</v>

1260
00:36:18.211 --> 00:36:19.380
<v Speaker 1>You look,</v>

1261
00:36:19.381 --> 00:36:20.850
<v Speaker 1>if once it happens,</v>

1262
00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.140
<v Speaker 1>then that's what it is.</v>

1263
00:36:22.350 --> 00:36:23.820
<v Speaker 1>And that's the problem with cops.</v>

1264
00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:27.090
<v Speaker 1>Like we can't think of a time where a cop wouldn't be riding speeding tickets,</v>

1265
00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:28.350
<v Speaker 1>but it's fucking ridiculous.</v>

1266
00:36:28.351 --> 00:36:29.580
<v Speaker 1>You're making a cop do that.</v>

1267
00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:31.620
<v Speaker 1>Either someone's violating the law,</v>

1268
00:36:31.621 --> 00:36:35.190
<v Speaker 1>which means they needed to be brought into jail or it's not that big a deal.</v>

1269
00:36:35.460 --> 00:36:36.330
<v Speaker 1>It's one or the other.</v>

1270
00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:37.351
<v Speaker 1>It's one or the other.</v>

1271
00:36:37.351 --> 00:36:41.460
<v Speaker 1>You can't just take money from people because they touched the gas pedal a</v>

1272
00:36:41.461 --> 00:36:42.061
<v Speaker 1>little too hard,</v>

1273
00:36:42.061 --> 00:36:42.660
<v Speaker 1>but they do.</v>

1274
00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:43.441
<v Speaker 1>And parking fines,</v>

1275
00:36:43.441 --> 00:36:44.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean la,</v>

1276
00:36:44.381 --> 00:36:44.850
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1277
00:36:44.850 --> 00:36:46.620
<v Speaker 1>I lived in San Francisco and London,</v>

1278
00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.600
<v Speaker 1>the three places I've lived and parking is,</v>

1279
00:36:48.601 --> 00:36:49.320
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

1280
00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.270
<v Speaker 1>that's the whole income of the city.</v>

1281
00:36:51.300 --> 00:36:52.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

1282
00:36:52.090 --> 00:36:52.290
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1283
00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:53.160
<v Speaker 1>Parking's giant.</v>

1284
00:36:53.161 --> 00:36:56.450
<v Speaker 1>If they made free parking and didn't write out parking tickets and then you</v>

1285
00:36:56.451 --> 00:36:56.580
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

1286
00:36:56.580 --> 00:36:58.140
<v Speaker 1>they can make a little bit of money from the change,</v>

1287
00:36:58.141 --> 00:36:59.520
<v Speaker 1>but they bank on you fucking up.</v>

1288
00:36:59.550 --> 00:36:59.851
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>

1289
00:36:59.851 --> 00:37:00.360
<v Speaker 1>they do.</v>

1290
00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:00.751
<v Speaker 1>What is it?</v>

1291
00:37:00.751 --> 00:37:02.220
<v Speaker 1>60 bucks to go over the meter.</v>

1292
00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:06.180
<v Speaker 1>$69 60 and then if you don't pay it in like two weeks,</v>

1293
00:37:06.181 --> 00:37:09.510
<v Speaker 1>I had immediately jumps to like 150 and you don't pay that for like a week.</v>

1294
00:37:09.511 --> 00:37:14.511
<v Speaker 1>That goes to like 300 we used to throw them in our glove box car before that</v>

1295
00:37:15.091 --> 00:37:15.481
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

1296
00:37:15.481 --> 00:37:16.950
<v Speaker 1>And when I lived in San Francisco,</v>

1297
00:37:16.951 --> 00:37:21.450
<v Speaker 1>I had a crappy Chevy Vega that like he had to put two quarts of oil in every</v>

1298
00:37:21.450 --> 00:37:21.451
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

1299
00:37:21.451 --> 00:37:22.280
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

1300
00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:22.720
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>

1301
00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:23.191
<v Speaker 1>nothing worked.</v>

1302
00:37:23.191 --> 00:37:25.800
<v Speaker 1>But unless you've got a thousand tickets,</v>

1303
00:37:25.801 --> 00:37:28.980
<v Speaker 1>the first year I lived in San Francisco and I threw them all in the glove box.</v>

1304
00:37:28.981 --> 00:37:33.030
<v Speaker 1>And finally a bench warrant was issued and I was hired to go appear in front of</v>

1305
00:37:33.031 --> 00:37:33.864
<v Speaker 1>a judge.</v>

1306
00:37:33.930 --> 00:37:34.740
<v Speaker 1>And at that point,</v>

1307
00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:39.630
<v Speaker 1>this is like 1980 it was like $1,500 worth of $5 tickets.</v>

1308
00:37:39.631 --> 00:37:40.020
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

1309
00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:40.820
<v Speaker 1>Or Wow.</v>

1310
00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:41.653
<v Speaker 1>And they went,</v>

1311
00:37:41.790 --> 00:37:42.330
<v Speaker 1>she went like,</v>

1312
00:37:42.330 --> 00:37:43.560
<v Speaker 1>what is your problem?</v>

1313
00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:44.790
<v Speaker 1>And I'm sorry,</v>

1314
00:37:44.791 --> 00:37:45.570
<v Speaker 1>your honor.</v>

1315
00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:45.931
<v Speaker 1>She goes,</v>

1316
00:37:45.931 --> 00:37:46.021
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

1317
00:37:46.021 --> 00:37:46.591
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do?</v>

1318
00:37:46.591 --> 00:37:46.951
<v Speaker 1>And I'm like,</v>

1319
00:37:46.951 --> 00:37:47.480
<v Speaker 1>oh no,</v>

1320
00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:48.151
<v Speaker 1>I don't have any money.</v>

1321
00:37:48.151 --> 00:37:48.560
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

1322
00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:48.810
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

1323
00:37:48.810 --> 00:37:49.570
<v Speaker 1>she,</v>

1324
00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:51.960
<v Speaker 1>she went 450 get outta here.</v>

1325
00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:52.800
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

1326
00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:53.430
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1327
00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:55.650
<v Speaker 1>So I think I painted over like a couple of months.</v>

1328
00:37:55.651 --> 00:37:57.670
<v Speaker 1>I didn't even have $450 so you know,</v>

1329
00:37:57.690 --> 00:38:02.160
<v Speaker 1>I paid like my car got booted once got booted because it didn't pay the tickets,</v>

1330
00:38:02.190 --> 00:38:03.023
<v Speaker 1>parking tickets.</v>

1331
00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:05.460
<v Speaker 1>Did you have to call someone to come and do it or,</v>

1332
00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:08.190
<v Speaker 1>I think I had to go somewhere and pay some money.</v>

1333
00:38:09.090 --> 00:38:10.110
<v Speaker 1>It was a long time ago.</v>

1334
00:38:10.111 --> 00:38:12.780
<v Speaker 1>It was in the 90s I remember it was in la.</v>

1335
00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:14.273
<v Speaker 1>I got the boot.</v>

1336
00:38:14.430 --> 00:38:14.790
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

1337
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:18.210
<v Speaker 1>And in London they took the car up and put it on a truck and take it away.</v>

1338
00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:18.600
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

1339
00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:20.280
<v Speaker 1>Whoa assholes.</v>

1340
00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:22.890
<v Speaker 1>You can't just take someone's car because they owe you money.</v>

1341
00:38:23.110 --> 00:38:25.840
<v Speaker 1>The car's worth way more than the fucking parking ticket.</v>

1342
00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:26.971
<v Speaker 1>It's astounding.</v>

1343
00:38:26.971 --> 00:38:31.170
<v Speaker 1>I found out the other day I was going through my mail and I had almost thrown it</v>

1344
00:38:31.171 --> 00:38:33.270
<v Speaker 1>away that I guess when I was in San Diego,</v>

1345
00:38:33.271 --> 00:38:36.220
<v Speaker 1>I went on one of those highways that I guess was a toll road,</v>

1346
00:38:36.220 --> 00:38:38.470
<v Speaker 2>but they don't even tell you or there they might have told you.</v>

1347
00:38:38.471 --> 00:38:40.690
<v Speaker 2>But it's real easy to just get on and get off.</v>

1348
00:38:40.691 --> 00:38:41.650
<v Speaker 2>And not even know you're on it.</v>

1349
00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:43.180
<v Speaker 2>They take a picture of your license.</v>

1350
00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:46.420
<v Speaker 2>He didn't pay and I didn't even know about it.</v>

1351
00:38:46.421 --> 00:38:47.410
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

1352
00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:48.100
<v Speaker 2>it,</v>

1353
00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:51.550
<v Speaker 2>I owe like a lot of money because I didn't have a bunch of times.</v>

1354
00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:52.960
<v Speaker 2>I forget now it's,</v>

1355
00:38:52.961 --> 00:38:54.160
<v Speaker 2>it's cause it was like two,</v>

1356
00:38:54.161 --> 00:38:56.680
<v Speaker 2>like two months old or three months old or something like that.</v>

1357
00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:58.660
<v Speaker 2>And I still kept going up again.</v>

1358
00:38:58.820 --> 00:38:59.653
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1359
00:38:59.750 --> 00:39:00.341
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1360
00:39:00.341 --> 00:39:02.350
<v Speaker 2>I got one from Illinois after Christmas.</v>

1361
00:39:02.351 --> 00:39:06.760
<v Speaker 2>I did a Gig in Arlington or somewhere and I went on a toll road and I was like,</v>

1362
00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:07.900
<v Speaker 2>did I pay,</v>

1363
00:39:07.901 --> 00:39:08.141
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1364
00:39:08.141 --> 00:39:09.580
<v Speaker 2>I just went through a thing and then like,</v>

1365
00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:13.000
<v Speaker 2>was I supposed to stop because there was no people manning.</v>

1366
00:39:13.001 --> 00:39:13.930
<v Speaker 2>That's a trick.</v>

1367
00:39:14.810 --> 00:39:16.450
<v Speaker 2>People manning it and then like there were,</v>

1368
00:39:16.451 --> 00:39:19.180
<v Speaker 2>I can see there were lanes where people had discs and I thought,</v>

1369
00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:20.260
<v Speaker 2>oh shit.</v>

1370
00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:22.270
<v Speaker 2>As soon as I went through it and sure enough,</v>

1371
00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:24.910
<v Speaker 2>a week later my wife goes,</v>

1372
00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:27.490
<v Speaker 2>when were you in Carbondale,</v>

1373
00:39:27.491 --> 00:39:27.831
<v Speaker 2>Illinois?</v>

1374
00:39:27.831 --> 00:39:28.121
<v Speaker 2>Or you know,</v>

1375
00:39:28.121 --> 00:39:28.631
<v Speaker 2>or whatever.</v>

1376
00:39:28.631 --> 00:39:29.464
<v Speaker 2>And I went,</v>

1377
00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:32.530
<v Speaker 2>I was driving from Chicago and I drove in a double room and she's like,</v>

1378
00:39:32.531 --> 00:39:34.300
<v Speaker 2>well it's $25 or whatever,</v>

1379
00:39:34.301 --> 00:39:35.134
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

1380
00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:36.190
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1381
00:39:36.190 --> 00:39:37.023
<v Speaker 2>That's uh,</v>

1382
00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:39.250
<v Speaker 2>that's that thing where they used to do,</v>

1383
00:39:39.251 --> 00:39:41.620
<v Speaker 2>when you go through a red light and they would take a picture of your license</v>

1384
00:39:41.621 --> 00:39:42.454
<v Speaker 2>plates and that illegal,</v>

1385
00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:43.110
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

1386
00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:44.020
<v Speaker 2>that was deemed illegal.</v>

1387
00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:44.970
<v Speaker 2>Oh Wow.</v>

1388
00:39:45.010 --> 00:39:47.140
<v Speaker 2>They still use it in west Hollywood and stuff.</v>

1389
00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:50.410
<v Speaker 2>Do they still use it to see them but other day I haven't.</v>

1390
00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:51.070
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

1391
00:39:51.070 --> 00:39:52.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they use them though.</v>

1392
00:39:52.571 --> 00:39:56.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if they still write tickets because I'm pretty sure they deem that</v>

1393
00:39:56.051 --> 00:39:59.890
<v Speaker 2>unconstitutional because it was a third party that was profiting off of it.</v>

1394
00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:01.120
<v Speaker 2>It was a private company.</v>

1395
00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:03.820
<v Speaker 2>So like you really didn't have to pay those tickets.</v>

1396
00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:06.130
<v Speaker 2>Like when you would get one of those tickets and it would say you ran a red</v>

1397
00:40:06.131 --> 00:40:06.401
<v Speaker 2>light,</v>

1398
00:40:06.401 --> 00:40:07.151
<v Speaker 2>we want a hundred bucks.</v>

1399
00:40:07.151 --> 00:40:08.410
<v Speaker 2>Like they were getting the money,</v>

1400
00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:10.780
<v Speaker 2>like the money wasn't going to the state and everybody's like,</v>

1401
00:40:10.781 --> 00:40:10.991
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

1402
00:40:10.991 --> 00:40:13.180
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are you doing?</v>

1403
00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:16.360
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have a private company that also profits from it.</v>

1404
00:40:16.570 --> 00:40:18.840
<v Speaker 2>I mean the state must have gotten a piece of the action,</v>

1405
00:40:19.090 --> 00:40:20.920
<v Speaker 2>but it was easier for them to just farm it out.</v>

1406
00:40:20.921 --> 00:40:21.071
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1407
00:40:21.071 --> 00:40:21.904
<v Speaker 2>I mean</v>

1408
00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:25.960
<v Speaker 2>that's why there's an alien billion zillion people in prison in this country.</v>

1409
00:40:25.961 --> 00:40:29.080
<v Speaker 2>It's not cause that many people have done anything worthy of being in prison.</v>

1410
00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:29.411
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1411
00:40:29.411 --> 00:40:32.260
<v Speaker 2>And we'll end the function of that whole system where someone's a winter and</v>

1412
00:40:32.261 --> 00:40:33.094
<v Speaker 2>someone's a loser.</v>

1413
00:40:33.310 --> 00:40:37.080
<v Speaker 2>Like when you see people win when they win in court and they found not guilty.</v>

1414
00:40:38.290 --> 00:40:40.780
<v Speaker 2>And that's like the three pointer of all three pointers.</v>

1415
00:40:41.170 --> 00:40:41.561
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1416
00:40:41.561 --> 00:40:42.940
<v Speaker 2>if you're about to go to jail and you're like,</v>

1417
00:40:43.150 --> 00:40:44.290
<v Speaker 2>remember when Oj Simpson,</v>

1418
00:40:44.291 --> 00:40:45.160
<v Speaker 2>when they said not guilty?</v>

1419
00:40:45.161 --> 00:40:45.491
<v Speaker 2>And he was like,</v>

1420
00:40:45.491 --> 00:40:46.324
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

1421
00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:47.223
<v Speaker 2>Really,</v>

1422
00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:49.033
<v Speaker 2>really?</v>

1423
00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:49.870
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

1424
00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:50.381
<v Speaker 2>you can see that.</v>

1425
00:40:50.381 --> 00:40:51.250
<v Speaker 2>Look on his face.</v>

1426
00:40:51.610 --> 00:40:52.443
<v Speaker 2>That guy,</v>

1427
00:40:52.510 --> 00:40:53.710
<v Speaker 2>I mean he was trying to play poker,</v>

1428
00:40:53.711 --> 00:40:55.540
<v Speaker 2>but he hit the lottery.</v>

1429
00:40:55.541 --> 00:40:57.880
<v Speaker 2>He knew it and he won three pointer,</v>

1430
00:40:58.090 --> 00:40:59.050
<v Speaker 2>Swish,</v>

1431
00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:03.550
<v Speaker 2>nothing but net home run over the building into the parking lot.</v>

1432
00:41:03.551 --> 00:41:04.680
<v Speaker 2>Pray King car when,</v>

1433
00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:06.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean he won.</v>

1434
00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:07.690
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1435
00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:10.570
<v Speaker 2>That you can't have winners and losers when it comes to laws and court.</v>

1436
00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:11.740
<v Speaker 2>That's just too crazy.</v>

1437
00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:14.590
<v Speaker 2>That's weird that he didn't just hide after that.</v>

1438
00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:17.980
<v Speaker 2>Like it was such a huge win that why would you even,</v>

1439
00:41:18.010 --> 00:41:20.970
<v Speaker 2>when did you just like not leave the house for the rest of your life and no,</v>

1440
00:41:20.980 --> 00:41:21.730
<v Speaker 2>he didn't want,</v>

1441
00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:25.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean I think he didn't want anybody to think that he's in jail now.</v>

1442
00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.880
<v Speaker 2>He's in jail now for felonies.</v>

1443
00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:29.740
<v Speaker 2>Well he's in jail now for,</v>

1444
00:41:29.741 --> 00:41:34.010
<v Speaker 2>I think they called it kidnapping and something along those lines.</v>

1445
00:41:34.011 --> 00:41:35.390
<v Speaker 2>Some armed something that,</v>

1446
00:41:35.391 --> 00:41:36.560
<v Speaker 2>that was the Caper in Vegas.</v>

1447
00:41:36.561 --> 00:41:37.130
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1448
00:41:37.130 --> 00:41:41.120
<v Speaker 2>That was the thing in Vegas where he was a victim of someone taking his stuff</v>

1449
00:41:41.121 --> 00:41:41.990
<v Speaker 2>and selling it.</v>

1450
00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:46.820
<v Speaker 2>Like some of his memorabilia got sold by this guy and he wanted to get his stuff</v>

1451
00:41:46.821 --> 00:41:47.031
<v Speaker 2>back.</v>

1452
00:41:47.031 --> 00:41:52.031
<v Speaker 2>So we brought some dudes who brought some guns and as soon as that's the case,</v>

1453
00:41:52.371 --> 00:41:53.204
<v Speaker 2>you're fucks.</v>

1454
00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:53.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1455
00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:55.250
<v Speaker 2>And the government came in and they go,</v>

1456
00:41:55.251 --> 00:41:55.820
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>

1457
00:41:55.820 --> 00:41:58.130
<v Speaker 2>we've been looking for an excuse to put you away.</v>

1458
00:41:58.610 --> 00:42:00.620
<v Speaker 2>And so they just locked him up.</v>

1459
00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:02.090
<v Speaker 2>But he's fucked psyche.</v>

1460
00:42:02.091 --> 00:42:03.170
<v Speaker 2>Say it with my life.</v>

1461
00:42:03.171 --> 00:42:05.870
<v Speaker 2>And now I say it like when you know how Hollywood is.</v>

1462
00:42:05.871 --> 00:42:06.650
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

1463
00:42:06.650 --> 00:42:07.940
<v Speaker 2>especially young actresses,</v>

1464
00:42:07.941 --> 00:42:08.361
<v Speaker 2>they get out,</v>

1465
00:42:08.361 --> 00:42:09.140
<v Speaker 2>jog dad,</v>

1466
00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:09.951
<v Speaker 2>they go crazy.</v>

1467
00:42:09.951 --> 00:42:12.890
<v Speaker 2>The next thing you know you've seen a picture of them and then they're in the</v>

1468
00:42:12.891 --> 00:42:16.910
<v Speaker 2>street upside down and then they stay here and,</v>

1469
00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:20.450
<v Speaker 2>or maybe they go to rehab for a month and we always go move to France,</v>

1470
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:22.001
<v Speaker 2>moved somewhere with,</v>

1471
00:42:22.001 --> 00:42:22.950
<v Speaker 2>they'll appreciate you.</v>

1472
00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:24.980
<v Speaker 2>You're still a star in Europe or whatever,</v>

1473
00:42:24.981 --> 00:42:25.790
<v Speaker 2>no matter what.</v>

1474
00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:26.810
<v Speaker 2>And in other countries,</v>

1475
00:42:26.811 --> 00:42:28.100
<v Speaker 2>they don't look at it the same way,</v>

1476
00:42:28.490 --> 00:42:32.890
<v Speaker 2>but why stay here under the scrutiny of TMZ and all of a sudden was getting</v>

1477
00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:33.710
<v Speaker 2>their bench.</v>

1478
00:42:33.710 --> 00:42:36.140
<v Speaker 2>That fucking Rosetta stone is a pain in the ass.</v>

1479
00:42:36.650 --> 00:42:37.960
<v Speaker 2>If you want to really laugh French,</v>

1480
00:42:37.961 --> 00:42:38.870
<v Speaker 2>it takes too long.</v>

1481
00:42:38.930 --> 00:42:39.763
<v Speaker 2>They're lazy,</v>

1482
00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:41.320
<v Speaker 2>they want to do coke and get fucked.</v>

1483
00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:44.030
<v Speaker 2>They are lazy eye.</v>

1484
00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:44.691
<v Speaker 2>I'm like,</v>

1485
00:42:44.691 --> 00:42:44.931

<v Speaker 2>That must've been when all the legal shit was hitting the fan.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Now I just feel bad about him.</v>

1515
00:43:30.531 --> 00:43:30.771
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1516
00:43:30.771 --> 00:43:32.510
<v Speaker 2>like I watched the video sometimes and think,</v>

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:33.321
<v Speaker 2>God damn,</v>

<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>

1522
00:43:37.161 --> 00:43:38.510
<v Speaker 2>how about the fact that it was just,</v>

1523
00:43:38.600 --> 00:43:40.700

1524
00:43:40.701 --> 00:43:41.031
<v Speaker 2>young,</v>

1525

<v Speaker 2>of course it does.</v>

1528
00:43:43.581 --> 00:43:44.331
<v Speaker 2>It's impossible.</v>

1529
00:43:44.331 --> 00:43:47.210
<v Speaker 2>You can't go through life learning about the,</v>

1530
00:43:47.211 --> 00:43:51.470
<v Speaker 2>the trials and tribulations of being a human being amongst other human beings on</v>

1531
00:43:51.471 --> 00:43:51.711
<v Speaker 2>earth.</v>

1532
00:43:51.711 --> 00:43:54.650
<v Speaker 2>If you never feel like you're one with all those people around,</v>

<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

1555
00:44:30.410 --> 00:44:31.243
<v Speaker 2>they were,</v>

1556
00:44:31.470 --> 00:44:32.130
<v Speaker 2>while all</v>

1557
00:44:32.130 --> 00:44:34.170
<v Speaker 3>the protests were going on for the young man.</v>

1558
00:44:34.530 --> 00:44:35.540
<v Speaker 3>What is Freddie,</v>

1559
00:44:35.550 --> 00:44:36.570
<v Speaker 3>what was his name?</v>

1560
00:44:36.571 --> 00:44:37.220
<v Speaker 3>This is the new,</v>

1561
00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:38.790
<v Speaker 3>was Freddie Gray's at it?</v>

1562
00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:39.810
<v Speaker 3>Was it?</v>

1563
00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:40.500
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember.</v>

1564
00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:41.333
<v Speaker 3>I don't remember.</v>

1565
00:44:41.550 --> 00:44:42.490
<v Speaker 3>W the,</v>

1566
00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:44.730
<v Speaker 3>it was a young man that was in police custody.</v>

1567
00:44:45.210 --> 00:44:45.930
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

1568
00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:50.930
<v Speaker 3>and there was some discrepancy of how he died and he died from trauma and they</v>

1569
00:44:51.361 --> 00:44:53.220
<v Speaker 3>think that the police beat this guy to death.</v>

1570
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:55.140
<v Speaker 3>So there's this huge,</v>

1571
00:44:55.230 --> 00:45:00.230
<v Speaker 3>huge backlash because people can only see so many black dudes get shot by cops</v>

1572
00:45:02.941 --> 00:45:07.650
<v Speaker 3>are choked by cops or beaten by cops or shot running away unarmed.</v>

1573
00:45:07.770 --> 00:45:11.040
<v Speaker 3>They can only see so much of that and now they've hit this breaking point.</v>

1574
00:45:11.100 --> 00:45:11.701
<v Speaker 3>I hope so.</v>

1575
00:45:11.701 --> 00:45:13.050
<v Speaker 3>I hope this changes things</v>

1576
00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:17.150
<v Speaker 3>going on since Eric Garner and now it's been rolling on.</v>

1577
00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:18.150
<v Speaker 3>So it's the fucking beginning.</v>

1578
00:45:18.550 --> 00:45:19.420
<v Speaker 3>No skyline.</v>

1579
00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:20.683
<v Speaker 3>But you know.</v>

1580
00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:21.450
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

1581
00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:22.283
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

1582
00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:25.410
<v Speaker 3>But like everybody who wants there to be no crime,</v>

1583
00:45:25.860 --> 00:45:27.950
<v Speaker 3>you got to think about like we,</v>

1584
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:32.990
<v Speaker 3>we will all sympathize with poor Michael Jackson born to this crazy family of</v>

1585
00:45:33.690 --> 00:45:37.740
<v Speaker 3>entertainers and made famous when he was young and had a predilection allegedly</v>

1586
00:45:37.741 --> 00:45:39.870
<v Speaker 3>for young boys is poor fucker.</v>

1587
00:45:39.870 --> 00:45:40.471
<v Speaker 3>And it's crazy.</v>

1588
00:45:40.471 --> 00:45:43.560
<v Speaker 3>Twisted childhood every day.</v>

1589
00:45:43.561 --> 00:45:46.260
<v Speaker 3>All across the country and ghettos.</v>

1590
00:45:46.261 --> 00:45:48.960
<v Speaker 3>There are horrific scenarios playing out.</v>

1591
00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:53.280
<v Speaker 3>The babies are growing up and then it's not all babies is not all poor people,</v>

1592
00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:55.140
<v Speaker 3>but we're not talking just poor.</v>

1593
00:45:55.141 --> 00:45:59.310
<v Speaker 3>We're talking poor that are surrounded by desperate people pour that are</v>

1594
00:45:59.311 --> 00:46:03.180
<v Speaker 3>surrounded by people that have grown up doing crime.</v>

1595
00:46:03.210 --> 00:46:05.100
<v Speaker 3>Like their whole life has been about crime.</v>

1596
00:46:05.101 --> 00:46:07.440
<v Speaker 3>Everyone around them is involved in crime.</v>

1597
00:46:07.680 --> 00:46:11.250
<v Speaker 3>You're gonna run into those people occasionally where a good percentage of the</v>

1598
00:46:11.251 --> 00:46:14.130
<v Speaker 3>families in and out of jail where it seems normal.</v>

1599
00:46:14.190 --> 00:46:15.750
<v Speaker 3>It seems rational.</v>

1600
00:46:16.260 --> 00:46:17.640
<v Speaker 3>How about that person?</v>

1601
00:46:17.670 --> 00:46:19.830
<v Speaker 3>How about that person when she's got to go to college,</v>

1602
00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:21.590
<v Speaker 3>when she's 18 w what?</v>

1603
00:46:21.820 --> 00:46:25.050
<v Speaker 3>What fucking horrific PTSD does she have from,</v>

1604
00:46:25.200 --> 00:46:29.210
<v Speaker 3>from growing up in the worst sections of Compton or Inglewood or wines.</v>

1605
00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:29.880
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1606
00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:33.150
<v Speaker 3>That's why education is important to spend on the law enforcement.</v>

1607
00:46:33.170 --> 00:46:36.420
<v Speaker 3>If they don't even more intense than that,</v>

1608
00:46:36.450 --> 00:46:41.040
<v Speaker 3>it has to be taken to a totally different place because it's not education terms</v>

1609
00:46:41.041 --> 00:46:42.030
<v Speaker 3>of like come in,</v>

1610
00:46:42.031 --> 00:46:42.870
<v Speaker 3>sit down,</v>

1611
00:46:42.990 --> 00:46:45.810
<v Speaker 3>we're going to teach you about George Washington and his fucking cherry tree.</v>

1612
00:46:46.140 --> 00:46:51.140
<v Speaker 3>It's got to be this like completely invasive supportive system that eliminates</v>

1613
00:46:51.961 --> 00:46:52.591
<v Speaker 3>ghettos.</v>

1614
00:46:52.591 --> 00:46:56.100
<v Speaker 3>Like you have to eliminate them if you don't eliminate ghettos.</v>

1615
00:46:56.101 --> 00:46:58.360
<v Speaker 3>And I don't mean make it so that they gentrify it,</v>

1616
00:46:58.361 --> 00:46:59.490
<v Speaker 3>no one can afford living in it.</v>

1617
00:46:59.491 --> 00:47:01.040
<v Speaker 3>Cause that's how the eliminate ghettos and lesbian,</v>

1618
00:47:01.041 --> 00:47:04.920
<v Speaker 3>they say they've been plenty of ghettos eliminated and a lot of towns I've lived</v>

1619
00:47:04.921 --> 00:47:05.160
<v Speaker 3>in,</v>

1620
00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:08.610
<v Speaker 3>New York City has a problem in San Francisco because New York,</v>

1621
00:47:08.611 --> 00:47:09.421
<v Speaker 3>there's so much.</v>

1622
00:47:09.421 --> 00:47:13.170
<v Speaker 3>The real estate is where it's so much that they could just come in and there's</v>

1623
00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:16.350
<v Speaker 3>an apartment building that's like old and shitty.</v>

1624
00:47:16.500 --> 00:47:19.890
<v Speaker 3>That space is worth ungodly amounts of money.</v>

1625
00:47:20.130 --> 00:47:21.960
<v Speaker 3>If they can convert it to high end apartments.</v>

1626
00:47:21.961 --> 00:47:23.340
<v Speaker 3>I just disappear just like that.</v>

1627
00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:23.671
<v Speaker 3>Oh No.</v>

1628
00:47:23.671 --> 00:47:24.690
<v Speaker 3>And then people are gone.</v>

1629
00:47:24.750 --> 00:47:24.991
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

1630
00:47:24.991 --> 00:47:27.060
<v Speaker 3>you mean improve neighborhoods where people live?</v>

1631
00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:27.670
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1632
00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:31.840
<v Speaker 3>You going to things like parks and resources and all of the above cases.</v>

1633
00:47:31.841 --> 00:47:32.674
<v Speaker 3>Kids can go,</v>

1634
00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:32.910
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

1635
00:47:32.910 --> 00:47:37.390
<v Speaker 3>community centers and even then how do you get,</v>

1636
00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:39.220
<v Speaker 3>how do you penetrate the home?</v>

1637
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.611
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

1638
00:47:39.611 --> 00:47:43.630
<v Speaker 3>how do you stop horrific childhoods from emerging?</v>

1639
00:47:43.631 --> 00:47:44.141
<v Speaker 3>I mean how do you,</v>

1640
00:47:44.141 --> 00:47:46.060
<v Speaker 3>but as human beings it's like,</v>

1641
00:47:46.070 --> 00:47:51.070
<v Speaker 3>what are we w we are essentially this giant community of people that denies it's</v>

1642
00:47:52.081 --> 00:47:52.914
<v Speaker 3>a community.</v>

1643
00:47:52.990 --> 00:47:56.950
<v Speaker 3>We have all these methods that we use to keep ourselves apart from each other,</v>

1644
00:47:57.100 --> 00:48:01.470
<v Speaker 3>whether it's Republican or Democrat or Islamic or Jewish.</v>

1645
00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:03.520
<v Speaker 3>All these little teams that we choose to,</v>

1646
00:48:03.730 --> 00:48:04.810
<v Speaker 3>but at the end of the day,</v>

1647
00:48:04.930 --> 00:48:08.590
<v Speaker 3>we're all just one giant race,</v>

1648
00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:10.360
<v Speaker 3>one super organism.</v>

1649
00:48:10.510 --> 00:48:10.961
<v Speaker 3>That's it.</v>

1650
00:48:10.961 --> 00:48:12.520
<v Speaker 3>And anything that's calendar that,</v>

1651
00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:17.260
<v Speaker 3>anything that's like counterintuitive to that idea is unhealthy for us.</v>

1652
00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:17.620
<v Speaker 3>And well,</v>

1653
00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:18.670
<v Speaker 3>what's counterintuitive?</v>

1654
00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:20.380
<v Speaker 3>Ignore the worst spots.</v>

1655
00:48:20.980 --> 00:48:23.020
<v Speaker 3>Ignore it and get angry at them.</v>

1656
00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:23.831
<v Speaker 3>Ignore.</v>

1657
00:48:23.831 --> 00:48:24.900
<v Speaker 3>Ignore your hospital,</v>

1658
00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:27.000
<v Speaker 3>your cancer that you have in the,</v>

1659
00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:27.250
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

1660
00:48:27.250 --> 00:48:30.270
<v Speaker 3>the biological fiber of your being.</v>

1661
00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:32.560
<v Speaker 3>Ignore that and get angry at it for being that way.</v>

1662
00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:32.930
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

1663
00:48:32.930 --> 00:48:34.540
<v Speaker 3>I'll just pull yourself up by your bootstraps.</v>

1664
00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:36.550
<v Speaker 3>They're strapping a staph infection,</v>

1665
00:48:36.940 --> 00:48:37.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1666
00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:37.721
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

1667
00:48:37.721 --> 00:48:40.240
<v Speaker 3>imagine if that's how you looked at like a broken ankle.</v>

1668
00:48:40.241 --> 00:48:41.350
<v Speaker 3>You fucking pussy.</v>

1669
00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:42.940
<v Speaker 3>You look down at your broken ankle.</v>

1670
00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:43.331
<v Speaker 3>How about,</v>

1671
00:48:43.331 --> 00:48:43.541
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1672
00:48:43.541 --> 00:48:44.710
<v Speaker 3>I'm will give the left ankle.</v>

1673
00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:45.700
<v Speaker 3>Left Ankle is fine.</v>

1674
00:48:45.850 --> 00:48:47.470
<v Speaker 3>Left ankles did the same fucking roads.</v>

1675
00:48:47.471 --> 00:48:48.220
<v Speaker 3>You will are,</v>

1676
00:48:48.220 --> 00:48:49.450
<v Speaker 3>it's actually a perfect analogy.</v>

1677
00:48:49.451 --> 00:48:49.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

1678
00:48:49.870 --> 00:48:51.460
<v Speaker 3>If you're running and you break one ankle,</v>

1679
00:48:51.730 --> 00:48:52.001
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1680
00:48:52.001 --> 00:48:52.960
<v Speaker 3>does the good ankle go?</v>

1681
00:48:52.961 --> 00:48:53.650
<v Speaker 3>What bitch?</v>

1682
00:48:53.650 --> 00:48:56.350
<v Speaker 3>I fucking did the same road I worked on this.</v>

1683
00:48:56.530 --> 00:48:57.230
<v Speaker 3>This isn't it.</v>

1684
00:48:57.230 --> 00:49:00.130
<v Speaker 3>This is not how it works as a super organism.</v>

1685
00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:03.160
<v Speaker 3>You can't have places like this scene in Baltimore.</v>

1686
00:49:03.161 --> 00:49:03.994
<v Speaker 3>Did you find the video?</v>

1687
00:49:04.270 --> 00:49:08.380
<v Speaker 3>Watch this video because you're going to freak the fuck out because let's play</v>

1688
00:49:08.381 --> 00:49:08.511
<v Speaker 3>good.</v>

1689
00:49:08.511 --> 00:49:09.520
<v Speaker 3>He would give it a little volume.</v>

1690
00:49:09.521 --> 00:49:10.630
<v Speaker 3>Hopefully our teeth.</v>

1691
00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:13.910
<v Speaker 4>So these guys look at this.</v>

1692
00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:35.603
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

1693
00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:41.010
<v Speaker 3>So now you see these guys running?</v>

1694
00:49:47.690 --> 00:49:48.523
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

1695
00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:51.773
<v Speaker 3>She stole it.</v>

1696
00:49:52.180 --> 00:49:57.180
<v Speaker 3>He stole her bag and the cops tackled this guy and took the bag back.</v>

1697
00:49:58.030 --> 00:50:00.010
<v Speaker 3>So the cops saved or how ironic.</v>

1698
00:50:00.011 --> 00:50:00.281
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1699
00:50:00.281 --> 00:50:01.114
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1700
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:02.103
<v Speaker 3>Her crazy.</v>

1701
00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:03.903
<v Speaker 3>Everything in play.</v>

1702
00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:05.133
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

1703
00:50:05.980 --> 00:50:09.700
<v Speaker 3>This video highlights a lot of shit,</v>

1704
00:50:09.701 --> 00:50:10.380
<v Speaker 3>doesn't it?</v>

1705
00:50:10.380 --> 00:50:13.720
<v Speaker 3>And it illuminates why you fucking need police.</v>

1706
00:50:13.750 --> 00:50:14.320
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

1707
00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:14.861
<v Speaker 3>there you go.</v>

1708
00:50:14.861 --> 00:50:17.200
<v Speaker 3>You just saw why you fucking need police.</v>

1709
00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:18.730
<v Speaker 3>You got your bag back.</v>

1710
00:50:18.731 --> 00:50:19.270
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>

1711
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:24.270
<v Speaker 3>Because the police caught the guy who robbed you on air is that's a good ending.</v>

1712
00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:27.441
<v Speaker 3>Damn.</v>

1713
00:50:27.441 --> 00:50:28.130
<v Speaker 3>I mean it's a great ending</v>

1714
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:28.671
<v Speaker 2>for the police.</v>

1715
00:50:28.671 --> 00:50:30.440
<v Speaker 2>That's like a fucking that you would have to think.</v>

1716
00:50:30.441 --> 00:50:31.820
<v Speaker 2>That might be like a viral video.</v>

1717
00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:32.570
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

1718
00:50:32.570 --> 00:50:34.460
<v Speaker 2>You might have to think like if the police were smart.</v>

1719
00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:36.440
<v Speaker 2>That's what let's like kind of video you pull out,</v>

1720
00:50:36.620 --> 00:50:41.210
<v Speaker 2>have this really super ultra liberal progressive chick getting robbed by black</v>

1721
00:50:41.211 --> 00:50:42.350
<v Speaker 2>dudes and then screaming,</v>

1722
00:50:42.351 --> 00:50:43.640
<v Speaker 2>give me back my bag.</v>

1723
00:50:43.880 --> 00:50:45.600
<v Speaker 2>She doesn't once dropping n bombs,</v>

1724
00:50:46.370 --> 00:50:47.060
<v Speaker 2>she's not,</v>

1725
00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:48.230
<v Speaker 2>my cell phone's in there.</v>

1726
00:50:48.231 --> 00:50:50.070
<v Speaker 2>You nigger shit.</v>

1727
00:50:50.660 --> 00:50:51.291
<v Speaker 2>You know what I'm saying?</v>

1728
00:50:51.291 --> 00:50:52.640
<v Speaker 2>Like she's super progressive.</v>

1729
00:50:52.641 --> 00:50:54.680
<v Speaker 2>Probably really smart.</v>

1730
00:50:54.830 --> 00:50:55.250
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

1731
00:50:55.250 --> 00:50:58.790
<v Speaker 2>brave journalists going in there and she could say by cops.</v>

1732
00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:00.253
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

1733
00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:01.213
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty crazy.</v>

1734
00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:02.960
<v Speaker 2>I think you're right that let,</v>

1735
00:51:03.110 --> 00:51:07.460
<v Speaker 2>letting the sickness of poverty just go on and on and the country where we</v>

1736
00:51:07.490 --> 00:51:09.560
<v Speaker 2>really do have the money to save everything.</v>

1737
00:51:09.590 --> 00:51:10.970
<v Speaker 2>That's real racism.</v>

1738
00:51:10.971 --> 00:51:11.900
<v Speaker 2>That's real.</v>

1739
00:51:12.050 --> 00:51:14.180
<v Speaker 2>And it's not just racist to black people.</v>

1740
00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:19.100
<v Speaker 2>It's racist to a gang of different ethnicities that are just completely ignored.</v>

1741
00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:20.890
<v Speaker 2>How about poor Asian communities?</v>

1742
00:51:20.891 --> 00:51:24.590
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot of like ultra poor Asian immigrant communities in this country</v>

1743
00:51:24.920 --> 00:51:25.753
<v Speaker 2>ignored,</v>

1744
00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:26.480
<v Speaker 2>ignored.</v>

1745
00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:27.170
<v Speaker 2>Figure it out,</v>

1746
00:51:27.170 --> 00:51:27.681
<v Speaker 2>figure it out.</v>

1747
00:51:27.681 --> 00:51:28.340
<v Speaker 2>You're on your own.</v>

1748
00:51:28.340 --> 00:51:30.200
<v Speaker 2>And I don't even know what the solution would be,</v>

1749
00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:35.380
<v Speaker 2>but I think there's a big part of the prison system that's ingrained in these</v>

1750
00:51:35.721 --> 00:51:36.680
<v Speaker 2>bad neighborhoods.</v>

1751
00:51:37.270 --> 00:51:39.200
<v Speaker 2>If you're looking at a bad neighborhood that's just,</v>

1752
00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:41.270
<v Speaker 2>there's crime has always been there.</v>

1753
00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:41.870
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

1754
00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:45.260
<v Speaker 2>So that means police acted if activity has always been there.</v>

1755
00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:49.190
<v Speaker 2>So then it becomes like the symbiotic relationship between police activity and</v>

1756
00:51:49.191 --> 00:51:53.870
<v Speaker 2>crime and there's no incentive whatsoever to try to slow it down other than cops</v>

1757
00:51:53.871 --> 00:51:56.250
<v Speaker 2>dying when cops get shot and killed on the,</v>

1758
00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:57.103
<v Speaker 2>on the job.</v>

1759
00:51:57.140 --> 00:52:01.430
<v Speaker 2>That's like when a big push to like sort of settle crime down and usually it's</v>

1760
00:52:01.431 --> 00:52:02.510
<v Speaker 2>just more arrests.</v>

1761
00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:02.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

1762
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:03.321
<v Speaker 2>I mean that's the,</v>

1763
00:52:03.321 --> 00:52:05.540
<v Speaker 2>the no one looks at like the inherent issue.</v>

1764
00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:06.171
<v Speaker 2>There's a,</v>

1765
00:52:06.171 --> 00:52:11.171
<v Speaker 2>there's a giant issue that there's winning and losing shit of arresting people</v>

1766
00:52:11.710 --> 00:52:14.860
<v Speaker 2>and punishing them and trying them and fight.</v>

1767
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:16.750
<v Speaker 2>They found guilty or not guilty and up.</v>

1768
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:17.690
<v Speaker 2>Yes or a no.</v>

1769
00:52:17.691 --> 00:52:20.630
<v Speaker 2>And a green or a red that beat me becomes a game.</v>

1770
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:21.890
<v Speaker 2>And that game,</v>

1771
00:52:21.891 --> 00:52:24.710
<v Speaker 2>no one in that game wants the game to stop.</v>

1772
00:52:25.040 --> 00:52:25.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

1773
00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:29.660
<v Speaker 2>it's for profit because the prison systems for profit and then on top of it,</v>

1774
00:52:29.661 --> 00:52:30.290
<v Speaker 2>there's no,</v>

1775
00:52:30.290 --> 00:52:31.700
<v Speaker 2>there's no equity at all.</v>

1776
00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:32.810
<v Speaker 2>All the bankers,</v>

1777
00:52:32.811 --> 00:52:32.991
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1778
00:52:32.991 --> 00:52:35.900
<v Speaker 2>to make a huge analogy that all the bankers and everyone who ruined the economy</v>

1779
00:52:35.901 --> 00:52:36.410
<v Speaker 2>and everything,</v>

1780
00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:38.930
<v Speaker 2>none of them did any time and no one ever laid a hand on them.</v>

1781
00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:43.670
<v Speaker 2>But people who commit small crimes and petty crimes are always getting busted</v>

1782
00:52:43.671 --> 00:52:44.300
<v Speaker 2>and turn on a gene.</v>

1783
00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:46.550
<v Speaker 2>Edwards has a brilliant joke about that.</v>

1784
00:52:46.610 --> 00:52:47.960
<v Speaker 2>Here's a brilliant joke about that.</v>

1785
00:52:47.961 --> 00:52:48.794
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to give it away.</v>

1786
00:52:48.830 --> 00:52:49.910
<v Speaker 2>I can't even say the punchline,</v>

1787
00:52:49.911 --> 00:52:53.270
<v Speaker 2>but he's got a brilliant joke about comparison comparing thugs to bankers,</v>

1788
00:52:53.290 --> 00:52:53.540
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

1789
00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:54.520
<v Speaker 2>Fucking a lariat.</v>

1790
00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:59.060
<v Speaker 2>My Jack has no black teenager ever ruin the economy on me and no black teenager</v>

1791
00:52:59.061 --> 00:53:00.290
<v Speaker 2>ever invaded Iraq.</v>

1792
00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:06.050
<v Speaker 2>I was like you said with the accentuation Iraq bitch.</v>

1793
00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:06.861
<v Speaker 2>That's why,</v>

1794
00:53:06.861 --> 00:53:07.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1795
00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:09.920
<v Speaker 2>the smartest man in the world is like for a lot of other people.</v>

1796
00:53:09.921 --> 00:53:11.000
<v Speaker 2>Couldn't pull that off dude.</v>

1797
00:53:11.420 --> 00:53:12.520
<v Speaker 2>Your sense of humor.</v>

1798
00:53:12.521 --> 00:53:12.841
<v Speaker 2>It's just like,</v>

1799
00:53:12.841 --> 00:53:13.520
<v Speaker 2>just,</v>

1800
00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:13.701
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

1801
00:53:13.701 --> 00:53:15.440
<v Speaker 2>there's some like unique sort of,</v>

1802
00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:15.710
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

1803
00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:17.150
<v Speaker 2>styles of humor.</v>

1804
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:21.410
<v Speaker 2>Like Brody Stevens is like my favorite example because the shit that Brody says,</v>

1805
00:53:21.411 --> 00:53:23.780
<v Speaker 2>it's only funny if you're Brody Stevens.</v>

1806
00:53:23.790 --> 00:53:24.180
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1807
00:53:24.180 --> 00:53:27.240
<v Speaker 2>But if you're Brody it's brilliant.</v>

1808
00:53:27.241 --> 00:53:27.570
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1809
00:53:27.570 --> 00:53:32.570
<v Speaker 2>He was fucking destroying one night like a month ago at the comedy store.</v>

1810
00:53:33.310 --> 00:53:36.000
<v Speaker 2>You know he does that late night spot after midnight.</v>

1811
00:53:36.001 --> 00:53:37.500
<v Speaker 2>You know like all the comics have already gone off.</v>

1812
00:53:37.501 --> 00:53:40.200
<v Speaker 2>The show has been going on since nine o'clock everyone's exhausted.</v>

1813
00:53:40.201 --> 00:53:42.240
<v Speaker 2>Whoever's there is a glutton for punishment,</v>

1814
00:53:42.241 --> 00:53:42.810
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

1815
00:53:42.810 --> 00:53:46.320
<v Speaker 2>20 people in the audience and then comics just start filtering in and Brody does</v>

1816
00:53:46.321 --> 00:53:47.430
<v Speaker 2>like 45 minutes.</v>

1817
00:53:47.431 --> 00:53:50.250
<v Speaker 2>I put some of it on Instagram where he's playing drums.</v>

1818
00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:55.500
<v Speaker 2>He's got someone's singing the lawsuit Tisa animal and it's just,</v>

1819
00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:56.250
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

1820
00:53:56.250 --> 00:53:59.910
<v Speaker 2>it's the Brody show for the last hour of the comedy store.</v>

1821
00:53:59.911 --> 00:54:01.200
<v Speaker 2>It's the Brody show when he does it,</v>

1822
00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:02.760
<v Speaker 2>it's him and Brian Holtzman.</v>

1823
00:54:02.761 --> 00:54:04.710
<v Speaker 2>Those are the masters at that late spot.</v>

1824
00:54:04.711 --> 00:54:07.790
<v Speaker 2>And Don Barris to Don Buress is like Don Berrett.</v>

1825
00:54:07.791 --> 00:54:09.720
<v Speaker 2>Buress is like the master of debacle.</v>

1826
00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:10.411
<v Speaker 2>Like when,</v>

1827
00:54:10.411 --> 00:54:14.160
<v Speaker 2>if you want to see something absolutely ridiculous happen in the crowd.</v>

1828
00:54:14.161 --> 00:54:15.300
<v Speaker 2>Late night at the comedy store.</v>

1829
00:54:15.301 --> 00:54:16.530
<v Speaker 2>If Don bears is on stage,</v>

1830
00:54:16.531 --> 00:54:17.400
<v Speaker 2>it's likely to happen.</v>

1831
00:54:17.610 --> 00:54:22.140
<v Speaker 2>He's the master that like becoming the ring leader of the crazies.</v>

1832
00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:25.260
<v Speaker 2>He's just so comfortable with crazy people too.</v>

1833
00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:26.101
<v Speaker 2>That's awesome.</v>

1834
00:54:26.101 --> 00:54:27.900
<v Speaker 2>If you have the will to do that,</v>

1835
00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:31.770
<v Speaker 2>you want to go in late and I didn't and strike it down.</v>

1836
00:54:32.130 --> 00:54:33.840
<v Speaker 2>Well you don't want it for Brody.</v>

1837
00:54:33.841 --> 00:54:36.900
<v Speaker 2>That's like the perfect kind of set course course cause he needs to be in the</v>

1838
00:54:36.901 --> 00:54:37.270
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>

1839
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:38.340
<v Speaker 2>He's very environmental.</v>

1840
00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:39.120
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1841
00:54:39.120 --> 00:54:39.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

1842
00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:40.950
<v Speaker 2>But he's a perfect example there.</v>

1843
00:54:40.951 --> 00:54:41.140
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

1844
00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:43.220
<v Speaker 2>there's plenty of video because it's a reduction.</v>

1845
00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:49.700
<v Speaker 5>He's playlists,</v>

1846
00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:55.630
<v Speaker 5>drums making kissy faces and isn't got a guy out of the audience right next to</v>

1847
00:54:55.631 --> 00:54:58.930
<v Speaker 5>him playing the tambourine and people don't their,</v>

1848
00:54:58.931 --> 00:54:59.140
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1849
00:54:59.140 --> 00:55:00.140

00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:08.410
<v Speaker 2>It was always these crazy rumors to that there's a tunnel from the back of the</v>

1962
00:58:08.411 --> 00:58:08.950
<v Speaker 2>comedy store.</v>

1963
00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:12.160
<v Speaker 2>It goes under the comedy store and it goes up to crest hill where they had the</v>

1964
00:58:12.161 --> 00:58:14.650
<v Speaker 2>comic's house because when they bought the house,</v>

1965
00:58:14.651 --> 00:58:17.290
<v Speaker 2>they bought the comedy store together as one package.</v>

1966
00:58:17.410 --> 00:58:19.150
<v Speaker 2>Cause it was like Bugsy Siegel's place,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I have.</v>

1992
00:58:59.470 --> 00:59:00.430
<v Speaker 2>I'm not doing it now,</v>

1993
00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:01.293
<v Speaker 2>but have you ever,</v>

1994
00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:03.180
<v Speaker 2>did you ever go through a period where we went,</v>

1995
00:59:03.970 --> 00:59:05.350
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I should do this stuff anymore?</v>

1996
00:59:05.770 --> 00:59:06.910
<v Speaker 2>I know because it was never,</v>

1997
00:59:06.911 --> 00:59:09.940
<v Speaker 2>I never seriously did it a lot because it's not,</v>

1998
00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:11.470
<v Speaker 2>I'm more of a pothead.</v>

1999
00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:14.770
<v Speaker 2>I know the feeling jacked,</v>

2000
00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:15.693
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

2001
00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:17.920
<v Speaker 2>wasn't for me.</v>

2002
00:59:17.921 --> 00:59:19.960
<v Speaker 2>It's I have to drink gallons of Lod Cath.</v>

2003
00:59:19.961 --> 00:59:21.070
<v Speaker 2>I do cocaine and I,</v>

2004
00:59:21.110 --> 00:59:22.070
<v Speaker 2>I'll drink anyway.</v>

2005
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:22.311
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2006
00:59:22.311 --> 00:59:23.420
<v Speaker 1>Because I can't sleep.</v>

2007
00:59:23.810 --> 00:59:23.901
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>

2008
00:59:23.901 --> 00:59:25.220
<v Speaker 1>Just to kind of calm down,</v>

2009
00:59:25.370 --> 00:59:25.571
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2010
00:59:25.571 --> 00:59:27.650
<v Speaker 1>like the basically coke is there.</v>

2011
00:59:27.651 --> 00:59:30.320
<v Speaker 1>She can drink as much as you can humanly get down.</v>

2012
00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:32.840
<v Speaker 1>My joke was because he'd go to the dealer.</v>

2013
00:59:32.841 --> 00:59:36.440
<v Speaker 1>So I used to do a real long routine about cocaine because George Bush said,</v>

2014
00:59:36.740 --> 00:59:38.720
<v Speaker 1>w Bush said he didn't remember.</v>

2015
00:59:39.250 --> 00:59:40.061
<v Speaker 1>But then I did coke.</v>

2016
00:59:40.061 --> 00:59:40.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2017
00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:41.000
<v Speaker 1>Someone said,</v>

2018
00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:41.300
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

2019
00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:42.021
<v Speaker 1>did you do cook?</v>

2020
00:59:42.021 --> 00:59:42.501
<v Speaker 1>Kenny goes,</v>

2021
00:59:42.501 --> 00:59:43.161
<v Speaker 1>I don't remember.</v>

2022
00:59:43.161 --> 00:59:43.730
<v Speaker 1>And I was like,</v>

2023
00:59:43.730 --> 00:59:44.270
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

2024
00:59:44.270 --> 00:59:46.490
<v Speaker 1>you remember if you did coke?</v>

2025
00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:47.780
<v Speaker 1>There's no forgetting it.</v>

2026
00:59:47.810 --> 00:59:49.040
<v Speaker 1>Even if he just did it once.</v>

2027
00:59:49.310 --> 00:59:51.220
<v Speaker 1>And then I said elaborate measures have to be enacted.</v>

2028
00:59:51.230 --> 00:59:51.471
<v Speaker 1>You have to,</v>

2029
00:59:51.471 --> 00:59:52.280
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

2030
00:59:52.280 --> 00:59:55.790
<v Speaker 1>my distinct recollection is you have to go to one assholes house</v>

2031
00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:02.000
<v Speaker 1>and then he tells you about the quality of it and you're like quality.</v>

2032
01:00:02.001 --> 01:00:03.980
<v Speaker 1>I've debased myself by being here.</v>

2033
01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:04.761
<v Speaker 1>I would snort,</v>

2034
01:00:04.761 --> 01:00:07.100
<v Speaker 1>drain off of fucking midget right now.</v>

2035
01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:07.890
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

2036
01:00:07.890 --> 01:00:08.900
<v Speaker 1>let's get this going.</v>

2037
01:00:08.901 --> 01:00:12.230
<v Speaker 1>I got a knight to ruin than someone drags.</v>

2038
01:00:12.231 --> 01:00:13.250
<v Speaker 1>You face down a stair,</v>

2039
01:00:13.251 --> 01:00:15.980
<v Speaker 1>you go to Denny's and spend the whole time barfing in the bathroom cause she</v>

2040
01:00:15.981 --> 01:00:16.814
<v Speaker 1>can't eat.</v>

2041
01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:17.691
<v Speaker 1>Someone drags.</v>

2042
01:00:17.691 --> 01:00:22.160
<v Speaker 1>You face down the stairs and you call someone you booty call someone at four in</v>

2043
01:00:22.161 --> 01:00:25.220
<v Speaker 1>the morning that you met at a Yaz concert in 1994</v>

2044
01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:28.070
<v Speaker 2>well that's a strong booty call.</v>

2045
01:00:28.210 --> 01:00:28.590
<v Speaker 2>That's a,</v>

2046
01:00:28.590 --> 01:00:29.421
<v Speaker 2>that's a hail Mary.</v>

2047
01:00:29.421 --> 01:00:29.721
<v Speaker 2>I said,</v>

2048
01:00:29.721 --> 01:00:30.554
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2049
01:00:31.310 --> 01:00:34.190
<v Speaker 2>that's just disingenuous to say you don't remember doing cocaine.</v>

2050
01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:34.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2051
01:00:34.490 --> 01:00:38.810
<v Speaker 2>it's disingenuous because you would remember whether or not you have done it and</v>

2052
01:00:38.811 --> 01:00:39.111
<v Speaker 2>you guys,</v>

2053
01:00:39.111 --> 01:00:40.100
<v Speaker 2>if you haven't done it,</v>

2054
01:00:40.101 --> 01:00:41.600
<v Speaker 2>you'd remember all the time.</v>

2055
01:00:41.601 --> 01:00:44.000
<v Speaker 2>I've never done coke because that comes up.</v>

2056
01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:47.150
<v Speaker 2>If you have a conversation with people once a year,</v>

2057
01:00:47.151 --> 01:00:47.811
<v Speaker 2>someone will say,</v>

2058
01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:47.991
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

2059
01:00:47.991 --> 01:00:49.170
<v Speaker 2>have you ever tried Qualia foods?</v>

2060
01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:49.730
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2061
01:00:49.730 --> 01:00:49.941
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

2062
01:00:49.941 --> 01:00:50.810
<v Speaker 2>I never fucked with that.</v>

2063
01:00:50.811 --> 01:00:51.680
<v Speaker 2>I don't fuck with pills.</v>

2064
01:00:51.681 --> 01:00:53.010
<v Speaker 2>Like what about yeah we do.</v>

2065
01:00:53.011 --> 01:00:55.370
<v Speaker 2>It's always have those sort of conversation or women I'm sure have those</v>

2066
01:00:55.371 --> 01:00:58.090
<v Speaker 2>conversations too and you would know whether or not you took coke.</v>

2067
01:00:58.140 --> 01:00:59.950
<v Speaker 2>There's a decision involved in taking cars.</v>

2068
01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:01.880
<v Speaker 2>This elaborate ritual that goes on with it.</v>

2069
01:01:01.881 --> 01:01:04.430
<v Speaker 2>There's all the chest rather than talking about it and acting like it's</v>

2070
01:01:04.431 --> 01:01:05.600
<v Speaker 2>important and it's a cause.</v>

2071
01:01:05.601 --> 01:01:06.411
<v Speaker 2>It's expensive.</v>

2072
01:01:06.411 --> 01:01:07.930
<v Speaker 2>And there's this like saying,</v>

2073
01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:12.570
<v Speaker 2>have you ever had a shot of wild Turkey memorably go,</v>

2074
01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:14.690
<v Speaker 2>I'm might've.</v>

2075
01:01:14.691 --> 01:01:15.260
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

2076
01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:15.700
<v Speaker 2>What's,</v>

2077
01:01:15.700 --> 01:01:16.533
<v Speaker 2>what's the difference?</v>

2078
01:01:16.670 --> 01:01:16.970
<v Speaker 2>Who Does?</v>

2079
01:01:16.970 --> 01:01:17.220
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>

2080
01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:17.770
<v Speaker 2>What side?</v>

2081
01:01:17.770 --> 01:01:19.520
<v Speaker 2>Jim Beam is that wild Turkey?</v>

2082
01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:20.361
<v Speaker 2>Is that different Shit,</v>

2083
01:01:20.361 --> 01:01:23.390
<v Speaker 2>you know you'd have those conversations like that makes sense but not,</v>

2084
01:01:23.391 --> 01:01:24.950
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember whether or not I did coke.</v>

2085
01:01:24.951 --> 01:01:25.820
<v Speaker 2>Get the fuck Outta here.</v>

2086
01:01:25.821 --> 01:01:26.360
<v Speaker 2>Bitch.</v>

2087
01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:28.640
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember whether you've ever had a drink of alcohol?</v>

2088
01:01:28.790 --> 01:01:30.080
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what,</v>

2089
01:01:30.170 --> 01:01:30.620
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2090
01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:31.453
<v Speaker 2>fuck the flood.</v>

2091
01:01:31.940 --> 01:01:32.151
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2092
01:01:32.151 --> 01:01:34.370
<v Speaker 2>you either did or you don't.</v>

2093
01:01:34.590 --> 01:01:35.221
<v Speaker 1>It can be.</v>

2094
01:01:35.221 --> 01:01:39.060
<v Speaker 1>It can be fun that I think when you base the night around it and everything</v>

2095
01:01:39.061 --> 01:01:41.970
<v Speaker 1>becomes we have to do more and more more and then at the end of the night when</v>

2096
01:01:41.971 --> 01:01:44.670
<v Speaker 1>there's no more and then it's a sad time.</v>

2097
01:01:44.700 --> 01:01:45.900
<v Speaker 1>That's always the sad part.</v>

2098
01:01:45.901 --> 01:01:48.450
<v Speaker 1>Just like it's not a positive drug that way.</v>

2099
01:01:48.451 --> 01:01:51.450
<v Speaker 1>Whereas pot at a certain point you're going to pull the rip cord because you're</v>

2100
01:01:51.451 --> 01:01:52.980
<v Speaker 1>just too high or you fall asleep or for</v>

2101
01:01:53.330 --> 01:01:55.770
<v Speaker 2>your time or we all go to Taco bell or whatever it is.</v>

2102
01:01:55.771 --> 01:01:56.190
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2103
01:01:56.190 --> 01:01:57.960
<v Speaker 2>it's a different kind of tired too.</v>

2104
01:01:58.470 --> 01:01:58.771
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

2105
01:01:58.771 --> 01:02:00.660
<v Speaker 2>I've never done a coke,</v>

2106
01:02:00.661 --> 01:02:01.860
<v Speaker 2>but the stimulants,</v>

2107
01:02:01.861 --> 01:02:06.180
<v Speaker 2>any kind of stimulant [inaudible] the next day racked I did ecstasy,</v>

2108
01:02:06.181 --> 01:02:08.770
<v Speaker 2>which is like very much like a stimulant that especially I think,</v>

2109
01:02:08.850 --> 01:02:12.630
<v Speaker 2>I think the shit I had was probably not 100% pure cause I've heard people say</v>

2110
01:02:12.631 --> 01:02:13.464
<v Speaker 2>that if you don't,</v>

2111
01:02:13.770 --> 01:02:14.760
<v Speaker 2>if feel like if you,</v>

2112
01:02:14.761 --> 01:02:16.440
<v Speaker 2>if you don't try it like pure,</v>

2113
01:02:16.441 --> 01:02:18.530
<v Speaker 2>you really don't know what the actual effects is.</v>

2114
01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:19.373
<v Speaker 2>Speeding.</v>

2115
01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:20.220
<v Speaker 2>There wasn't.</v>

2116
01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:20.871
<v Speaker 1>To me it ends that way.</v>

2117
01:02:20.871 --> 01:02:21.960
<v Speaker 1>I was definitely awake.</v>

2118
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:24.390
<v Speaker 1>I definitely stayed awake for a long fucking time.</v>

2119
01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:24.780
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2120
01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:25.051
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

2121
01:02:25.051 --> 01:02:25.320
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2122
01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:26.880
<v Speaker 1>I didn't think it was that speedy,</v>

2123
01:02:27.150 --> 01:02:30.060
<v Speaker 1>but then someone told me that it's like really frequently cut with it.</v>

2124
01:02:30.061 --> 01:02:30.241
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2125
01:02:30.241 --> 01:02:30.361
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

2126
01:02:30.361 --> 01:02:32.700
<v Speaker 1>how do you know you're getting it from a drug dealer?</v>

2127
01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:33.060
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2128
01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:34.890
<v Speaker 1>And that's inherently like a big part of the problem,</v>

2129
01:02:34.891 --> 01:02:35.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2130
01:02:35.190 --> 01:02:37.500
<v Speaker 1>You're getting it illegally so you,</v>

2131
01:02:37.530 --> 01:02:37.831
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>

2132
01:02:37.831 --> 01:02:38.431
<v Speaker 1>you're at risk.</v>

2133
01:02:38.431 --> 01:02:40.000
<v Speaker 1>You don't really know what the fuck you doing was.</v>

2134
01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:42.980
<v Speaker 1>If you buy it from someone in a bar or something,</v>

2135
01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.180
<v Speaker 1>then you're completely taking it on faith that they're,</v>

2136
01:02:45.181 --> 01:02:47.250
<v Speaker 1>have the goodwill to not poison you.</v>

2137
01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:48.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2138
01:02:48.090 --> 01:02:48.923
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what I was getting.</v>

2139
01:02:48.930 --> 01:02:49.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2140
01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:52.860
<v Speaker 1>it's going to ask you about the difference between stuff that's cut and stuff</v>

2141
01:02:52.861 --> 01:02:53.694
<v Speaker 1>that's not cut.</v>

2142
01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:55.800
<v Speaker 1>I don't think I've ever had rock star staff,</v>

2143
01:02:55.830 --> 01:02:56.100
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2144
01:02:56.100 --> 01:02:57.520
<v Speaker 1>and I hear stories about it.</v>

2145
01:02:57.800 --> 01:02:58.141
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2146
01:02:58.141 --> 01:03:00.990
<v Speaker 1>I've had friends who've done coke with famous people and junk and they go,</v>

2147
01:03:00.991 --> 01:03:01.201
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

2148
01:03:01.201 --> 01:03:02.940
<v Speaker 1>it was so pure and so good.</v>

2149
01:03:03.060 --> 01:03:05.670
<v Speaker 1>And then they delete and then evidently then you don't sweat and act like an</v>

2150
01:03:05.671 --> 01:03:06.630
<v Speaker 1>asshole other dental.</v>

2151
01:03:06.631 --> 01:03:08.950
<v Speaker 1>He then you're the life of the Goddamn party in your area.</v>

2152
01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:14.310
<v Speaker 1>Lighting ladies cigarettes and quipping off bone marrows and absolutely being</v>

2153
01:03:14.311 --> 01:03:15.510
<v Speaker 1>the event of the season.</v>

2154
01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:16.380
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2155
01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:16.651
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2156
01:03:16.651 --> 01:03:19.530
<v Speaker 1>I think whenever you're doing it it's just cause you want to get jacked and</v>

2157
01:03:19.531 --> 01:03:20.251
<v Speaker 1>drank a bunch.</v>

2158
01:03:20.251 --> 01:03:21.350
<v Speaker 1>And then we had asked,</v>

2159
01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:21.601
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2160
01:03:21.601 --> 01:03:23.310
<v Speaker 1>hanging out with a girl and you're like,</v>

2161
01:03:23.340 --> 01:03:24.091
<v Speaker 1>oh come here,</v>

2163
01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:26.450
<v Speaker 1>There's that.</v>

2164
01:03:27.010 --> 01:03:27.980
<v Speaker 1>She will go,</v>

2165
01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:31.410
<v Speaker 1>I think that's rape is technically kind of rapey</v>

2166
01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:35.640
<v Speaker 1>a little quick in there like chocolate quick to make a chocolate,</v>

2167
01:03:35.641 --> 01:03:36.091
<v Speaker 1>cocaine.</v>

2168
01:03:36.091 --> 01:03:37.080
<v Speaker 1>They chicks love that.</v>

2169
01:03:37.470 --> 01:03:38.303
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2170
01:03:38.310 --> 01:03:42.650
<v Speaker 1>These are some tips I cocaine tip or a chocolate shake mix.</v>

2171
01:03:42.670 --> 01:03:46.380
<v Speaker 1>A little bit of quick in there and it tastes like smells like chocolate when you</v>

2172
01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:47.430
<v Speaker 1>snort it.</v>

2173
01:03:47.430 --> 01:03:47.971
<v Speaker 1>Girls Love.</v>

2174
01:03:47.971 --> 01:03:49.150
<v Speaker 1>Have you actually done this?</v>

2175
01:03:51.310 --> 01:03:55.540
<v Speaker 1>You ever I take fruit loops and coat them with ecstasy and,</v>

2176
01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:55.871
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

2177
01:03:55.871 --> 01:03:59.070
<v Speaker 1>that's to what I was going to ask is is there a difference between like needing</v>

2178
01:03:59.071 --> 01:04:01.740
<v Speaker 1>alcohol when you have cut coke to not cook,</v>

2179
01:04:01.741 --> 01:04:02.131
<v Speaker 1>Cook cause you,</v>

2180
01:04:02.131 --> 01:04:03.760
<v Speaker 1>do you remember Tom Sawyer from uh,</v>

2181
01:04:04.020 --> 01:04:06.270
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] as well as I remember anyone.</v>

2182
01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:08.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm sending him a copy of the book tomorrow.</v>

2183
01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Fuck for the elaborate inscription.</v>

2184
01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:13.950
<v Speaker 1>Tell him I said he always just talk about rock star coke.</v>

2185
01:04:13.951 --> 01:04:15.830
<v Speaker 1>Like it was the god damn like it was.</v>

2186
01:04:15.870 --> 01:04:16.580
<v Speaker 1>That's what he'd say.</v>

2187
01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:16.830
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2188
01:04:16.830 --> 01:04:18.060
<v Speaker 1>That's where I got the expression.</v>

2189
01:04:18.260 --> 01:04:18.450
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2190
01:04:18.450 --> 01:04:20.920
<v Speaker 1>we would talk about doing it with like Kinison or rock.</v>

2191
01:04:21.450 --> 01:04:24.680
<v Speaker 1>He did it with like a bunch of like maybe it was Robin might've been robbing.</v>

2192
01:04:24.681 --> 01:04:25.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2193
01:04:25.020 --> 01:04:26.010
<v Speaker 1>whoever the fuck he did it with.</v>

2194
01:04:26.011 --> 01:04:27.330
<v Speaker 1>But he would talk about how it was like,</v>

2195
01:04:27.670 --> 01:04:32.670
<v Speaker 1>it was like the best Asian massage ever with a builtin happy ending.</v>

2196
01:04:33.120 --> 01:04:33.351
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2197
01:04:33.351 --> 01:04:36.180
<v Speaker 1>no questions asked and you just sleep like a baby afterwards.</v>

2198
01:04:36.450 --> 01:04:39.540
<v Speaker 1>He made it sound like this wonderful experience that you needed to try.</v>

2199
01:04:39.690 --> 01:04:42.030
<v Speaker 1>And then afterwards the big things like you could just go to bed.</v>

2200
01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:42.481
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>

2201
01:04:42.481 --> 01:04:43.020
<v Speaker 1>You can write.</v>

2202
01:04:43.020 --> 01:04:43.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

2203
01:04:43.590 --> 01:04:45.090
<v Speaker 1>how the fuck is that possible?</v>

2204
01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:48.420
<v Speaker 1>I guess cause I don't know because is it a completely,</v>

2205
01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:49.950
<v Speaker 1>I don't know like what the properties are,</v>

2206
01:04:49.951 --> 01:04:50.850
<v Speaker 1>but I'm assuming it's,</v>

2207
01:04:50.851 --> 01:04:52.050
<v Speaker 1>since it's a numbing agent,</v>

2208
01:04:52.051 --> 01:04:54.840
<v Speaker 1>it's an analgesic or like an anesthetic almost.</v>

2209
01:04:54.841 --> 01:04:59.550
<v Speaker 1>So really what it's getting stepped on with his crappy speed and other shit that</v>

2210
01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:01.590
<v Speaker 1>the additives is what Jack Shoe I'm guessing.</v>

2211
01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:02.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2212
01:05:02.191 --> 01:05:04.260
<v Speaker 1>but that never had like if you went to a pharmacy,</v>

2213
01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:07.530
<v Speaker 1>what a pharmacist would have would be pharmaceutical cocaine and that would be</v>

2214
01:05:07.531 --> 01:05:08.550
<v Speaker 1>very pure.</v>

2215
01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:10.380
<v Speaker 1>And then that's an experiment.</v>

2216
01:05:10.381 --> 01:05:12.360
<v Speaker 1>Let's let's get a pharmacist on the show.</v>

2217
01:05:12.361 --> 01:05:13.194
<v Speaker 1>Joe,</v>

2218
01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:17.010
<v Speaker 1>did you know that Coca Cola still uses coca leaves?</v>

2219
01:05:17.050 --> 01:05:17.710
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2220
01:05:17.710 --> 01:05:17.921
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

2221
01:05:17.921 --> 01:05:18.580
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>

2222
01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:19.780
<v Speaker 2>It's part of their flavor.</v>

2223
01:05:19.810 --> 01:05:20.980
<v Speaker 2>I don't think Pepsi does,</v>

2224
01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:26.200
<v Speaker 2>but Coca Cola uses actual coca leaves like and they extract medical grade</v>

2225
01:05:26.201 --> 01:05:28.690
<v Speaker 2>cocaine from it and then they you,</v>

2226
01:05:28.691 --> 01:05:32.650
<v Speaker 2>they like the same company that that does this for Coca Cola.</v>

2227
01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:36.730
<v Speaker 2>They also sell medical grade cocaine to like hospitals and shit.</v>

2228
01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:37.900
<v Speaker 2>Cause a numbing agent.</v>

2229
01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.180
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what they use it for,</v>

2230
01:05:39.190 --> 01:05:39.650
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2231
01:05:39.650 --> 01:05:40.240
<v Speaker 2>I don't,</v>

2232
01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:40.871
<v Speaker 2>I don't understand.</v>

2233
01:05:40.871 --> 01:05:41.920
<v Speaker 2>But apparently they make you,</v>

2234
01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:45.210
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have anything to do that.</v>

2235
01:05:45.260 --> 01:05:46.093
<v Speaker 2>Psychoanalysis,</v>

2236
01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:47.961
<v Speaker 2>what is it?</v>

2237
01:05:47.961 --> 01:05:48.731
<v Speaker 2>Stuff that they,</v>

2238
01:05:48.731 --> 01:05:50.600
<v Speaker 2>a lidocaine like line of can.</v>

2239
01:05:50.610 --> 01:05:52.620
<v Speaker 2>It's like cocaine's.</v>

2240
01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:54.280
<v Speaker 2>It's not an autistic brother.</v>

2241
01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:55.780
<v Speaker 2>I don't think I've ever had.</v>

2242
01:05:56.140 --> 01:05:57.730
<v Speaker 2>Maybe if I'd done the rock star Cook,</v>

2243
01:05:57.731 --> 01:05:59.050
<v Speaker 2>I'd be advocating it more.</v>

2244
01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:01.210
<v Speaker 2>To me it always just seemed like the people who did it.</v>

2245
01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:04.590
<v Speaker 2>Whenever the people that I wanted to roll with the yellow line,</v>

2246
01:06:04.591 --> 01:06:09.010
<v Speaker 2>the inside of the nose and medic ropes membranes before certain medical.</v>

2247
01:06:09.310 --> 01:06:09.831
<v Speaker 2>Well Huh.</v>

2248
01:06:09.831 --> 01:06:11.800
<v Speaker 2>I wonder why this is bleeding and swelling.</v>

2249
01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:12.634
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2250
01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:13.840
<v Speaker 2>so it's actual cocaine,</v>

2251
01:06:13.841 --> 01:06:14.740
<v Speaker 2>not lidocaine.</v>

2252
01:06:14.820 --> 01:06:15.140
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2253
01:06:15.140 --> 01:06:15.973
<v Speaker 2>she's interesting.</v>

2254
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.080
<v Speaker 2>Cocaine hydrochloride.</v>

2255
01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:17.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

2256
01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:21.190
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you remember how that one person I hung out with that used to do</v>

2257
01:06:21.191 --> 01:06:24.340
<v Speaker 2>liquid cocaine and it was just like a little spray model,</v>

2258
01:06:24.341 --> 01:06:25.390
<v Speaker 2>like a Flonase bottle.</v>

2259
01:06:25.391 --> 01:06:26.224
<v Speaker 2>He's just like,</v>

2260
01:06:26.280 --> 01:06:26.980
<v Speaker 2>and you just,</v>

2261
01:06:26.980 --> 01:06:27.810
<v Speaker 2>that's how you did it.</v>

2262
01:06:27.810 --> 01:06:31.030
<v Speaker 2>He's just trying to get it into your memory and as quickly as possible and by</v>

2263
01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:32.590
<v Speaker 2>putting it in in Lakewood,</v>

2264
01:06:32.591 --> 01:06:33.550
<v Speaker 2>you're absolutely,</v>

2265
01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:36.730
<v Speaker 2>what kind of liquid would you put it into that you could just spray in your nose</v>

2266
01:06:36.731 --> 01:06:37.420
<v Speaker 2>like that?</v>

2267
01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:38.320
<v Speaker 2>That's how it came.</v>

2268
01:06:38.321 --> 01:06:40.970
<v Speaker 2>It came like I can't let that atomizer spray down.</v>

2269
01:06:41.410 --> 01:06:41.800
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2270
01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:43.110
<v Speaker 2>That's why one of the a shelf.</v>

2271
01:06:43.130 --> 01:06:44.080
<v Speaker 2>It might be worth trying.</v>

2272
01:06:44.110 --> 01:06:44.601
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2273
01:06:44.601 --> 01:06:45.310
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2274
01:06:45.310 --> 01:06:46.143
<v Speaker 2>like I said,</v>

2275
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:47.530
<v Speaker 2>the older I get to you,</v>

2276
01:06:47.531 --> 01:06:49.420
<v Speaker 2>I don't want my heart to explode or anything.</v>

2277
01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:50.253
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2278
01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:52.940
<v Speaker 2>real issue that they say is a,</v>

2279
01:06:52.941 --> 01:06:57.220
<v Speaker 2>with the way they process cocaine from the coca leaves.</v>

2280
01:06:57.430 --> 01:07:02.430
<v Speaker 2>But the coca leaves themselves are not only not dangerous for you,</v>

2281
01:07:02.680 --> 01:07:05.170
<v Speaker 2>but really common and kind of healthy.</v>

2282
01:07:05.590 --> 01:07:05.891
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2283
01:07:05.891 --> 01:07:10.891
<v Speaker 2>they have like Fido nutrients and there's some properties it for thousands of</v>

2284
01:07:10.990 --> 01:07:11.823
<v Speaker 2>years in South America.</v>

2285
01:07:12.250 --> 01:07:14.710
<v Speaker 2>It rots the holy fuck out of your teeth,</v>

2286
01:07:14.711 --> 01:07:15.544
<v Speaker 2>son.</v>

2287
01:07:15.610 --> 01:07:17.200
<v Speaker 2>It rots the holy fuck out of your teeth.</v>

2288
01:07:17.201 --> 01:07:19.390
<v Speaker 2>You see those dudes that chew those coca leaves all the time.</v>

2289
01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:23.080
<v Speaker 2>It might be that they like doing coca leaves so much they don't ever bother</v>

2290
01:07:23.081 --> 01:07:23.500
<v Speaker 2>brushing.</v>

2291
01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:23.651
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2292
01:07:23.651 --> 01:07:27.790
<v Speaker 2>They probably don't have really good dental care for chewing on how they built</v>

2293
01:07:27.791 --> 01:07:31.750
<v Speaker 2>the Inca empire because it's a mild stimulant and just stick it in your cheek</v>

2294
01:07:31.751 --> 01:07:32.584
<v Speaker 2>like chill.</v>

2295
01:07:32.610 --> 01:07:32.890
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2296
01:07:32.890 --> 01:07:33.940
<v Speaker 2>I need just keep it in there.</v>

2297
01:07:33.941 --> 01:07:35.300
<v Speaker 2>And it allows you,</v>

2298
01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:38.080
<v Speaker 2>because it restricts the blood vessels to work at higher altitudes,</v>

2299
01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:38.770
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>

2300
01:07:38.770 --> 01:07:39.041
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2301
01:07:39.041 --> 01:07:39.874
<v Speaker 2>there's all these,</v>

2302
01:07:41.110 --> 01:07:43.330
<v Speaker 2>they were able to build massive cities and</v>

2303
01:07:44.890 --> 01:07:49.890
<v Speaker 2>the higher altitude tincture at precarious fucking lofty heights all through the</v>

2304
01:07:51.131 --> 01:07:53.050
<v Speaker 2>empire for thousands of miles.</v>

2305
01:07:53.050 --> 01:07:55.060
<v Speaker 2>And it certain that they're all,</v>

2306
01:07:55.150 --> 01:07:55.983
<v Speaker 2>all the workers.</v>

2307
01:07:56.020 --> 01:07:57.380
<v Speaker 2>Well that's one of the daily,</v>

2308
01:07:57.660 --> 01:07:57.880
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

2309
01:07:57.880 --> 01:07:58.713
<v Speaker 2>without a doubt.</v>

2310
01:07:58.780 --> 01:07:59.291
<v Speaker 2>I mean there,</v>

2311
01:07:59.291 --> 01:08:00.760
<v Speaker 2>that's a really common thing today.</v>

2312
01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:02.410
<v Speaker 2>And the people who pick it,</v>

2313
01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:04.030
<v Speaker 2>they don't snort it.</v>

2314
01:08:04.031 --> 01:08:04.460
<v Speaker 2>They chew,</v>

2315
01:08:04.460 --> 01:08:04.960
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2316
01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:05.291
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2317
01:08:05.291 --> 01:08:06.124
<v Speaker 2>They're all chew it.</v>

2318
01:08:06.610 --> 01:08:07.990
<v Speaker 2>It's like really common.</v>

2319
01:08:07.991 --> 01:08:11.380
<v Speaker 2>Like they have these bags of it and they hand it to each other and they take it</v>

2320
01:08:11.381 --> 01:08:12.970
<v Speaker 2>and they grab it and they stuffed it in their mouth.</v>

2321
01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:13.481
<v Speaker 2>Like,</v>

2322
01:08:13.481 --> 01:08:15.680
<v Speaker 2>look how much this guy's got stuffed in his face.</v>

2323
01:08:15.681 --> 01:08:16.970
<v Speaker 2>Like a giant squirrel person,</v>

2324
01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:18.530
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2325
01:08:18.530 --> 01:08:19.370
<v Speaker 2>that's what they do.</v>

2326
01:08:20.420 --> 01:08:20.721
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2327
01:08:20.721 --> 01:08:23.780
<v Speaker 2>if you were climbing and the Andes and you wanted to,</v>

2328
01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:24.621
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>

2329
01:08:24.621 --> 01:08:27.860
<v Speaker 2>feel better and not have a altitude sickness,</v>

2330
01:08:28.010 --> 01:08:29.630
<v Speaker 2>the cocaine alleviates,</v>

2331
01:08:29.970 --> 01:08:30.780
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2332
01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:32.180
<v Speaker 2>For us who are not,</v>

2333
01:08:32.210 --> 01:08:33.290
<v Speaker 2>we're land inbound,</v>

2334
01:08:33.291 --> 01:08:35.300
<v Speaker 2>but it's not going to live at 8,000 feet or whatever.</v>

2335
01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:37.580
<v Speaker 2>It's not cocaine,</v>

2336
01:08:37.790 --> 01:08:38.480
<v Speaker 2>cocaine leaves.</v>

2337
01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:38.720
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2338
01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:39.430
<v Speaker 2>it's Coco,</v>

2339
01:08:39.430 --> 01:08:39.940
<v Speaker 2>Coco,</v>

2340
01:08:39.940 --> 01:08:40.550
<v Speaker 2>Coco,</v>

2341
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.970
<v Speaker 2>Coco,</v>

2342
01:08:40.970 --> 01:08:45.970
<v Speaker 2>cocaine is the extract is the more unnatural and it is fucked the same way</v>

2343
01:08:47.090 --> 01:08:47.990
<v Speaker 2>sugars fucked.</v>

2344
01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:51.320
<v Speaker 2>Like when you take sugar like regular sugar and you pour it on your frosted</v>

2345
01:08:51.321 --> 01:08:51.950
<v Speaker 2>flakes,</v>

2346
01:08:51.950 --> 01:08:53.510
<v Speaker 2>you're just poisoning yourself.</v>

2347
01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:55.070
<v Speaker 2>You're just giving yourself sugar.</v>

2348
01:08:55.071 --> 01:08:55.881
<v Speaker 2>It tastes awesome.</v>

2349
01:08:55.881 --> 01:08:57.150
<v Speaker 2>Don't get me wrong when I hate it,</v>

2350
01:08:57.680 --> 01:08:58.970
<v Speaker 2>but you're giving yourself,</v>

2351
01:08:59.030 --> 01:09:01.160
<v Speaker 2>it's like a toxin at that level.</v>

2352
01:09:01.161 --> 01:09:01.791
<v Speaker 2>It's toxic,</v>

2353
01:09:01.791 --> 01:09:02.480
<v Speaker 2>it's bad,</v>

2354
01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:03.860
<v Speaker 2>it's actually bad for your body.</v>

2355
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:06.290
<v Speaker 2>It can diminish your body's performance.</v>

2356
01:09:06.530 --> 01:09:09.350
<v Speaker 2>Your by your insulin levels get off fucking out of whack.</v>

2357
01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:10.101
<v Speaker 2>Your body is like,</v>

2358
01:09:10.101 --> 01:09:11.480
<v Speaker 2>what is this?</v>

2359
01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:13.970
<v Speaker 2>Because you're not supposed to have sugar in that form.</v>

2360
01:09:14.150 --> 01:09:18.680
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to come attached to fiber and watermelon and apples and all these</v>

2361
01:09:18.681 --> 01:09:20.960
<v Speaker 2>different fruits that we'd normally get sugar from.</v>

2362
01:09:20.961 --> 01:09:21.794
<v Speaker 2>It's supposed to be,</v>

2363
01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:22.610
<v Speaker 2>there's like,</v>

2364
01:09:22.610 --> 01:09:25.280
<v Speaker 2>you know a relationship that these,</v>

2365
01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:26.001
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>

2366
01:09:26.001 --> 01:09:29.780
<v Speaker 2>these nutrients and the various aspects of food I'll have to the actual piece of</v>

2367
01:09:29.781 --> 01:09:33.080
<v Speaker 2>food that they come from when you just extract one,</v>

2368
01:09:33.370 --> 01:09:33.980
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2369
01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:37.760
<v Speaker 2>good part of it like sugar or cocaine.</v>

2370
01:09:38.030 --> 01:09:42.210
<v Speaker 2>Like you're taking it out of the whole symbiotic plant systems.</v>

2371
01:09:43.230 --> 01:09:45.570
<v Speaker 2>Cause isn't that like the story that know?</v>

2372
01:09:45.610 --> 01:09:46.460
<v Speaker 2>I just read this book,</v>

2373
01:09:46.461 --> 01:09:46.941
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember it.</v>

2374
01:09:46.941 --> 01:09:49.910
<v Speaker 2>It's called the six six drinks in the history of the world and six drinks.</v>

2375
01:09:50.240 --> 01:09:52.260
<v Speaker 2>And they talked a lot about coca cola in it.</v>

2376
01:09:52.610 --> 01:09:53.443
<v Speaker 2>Look at that shit.</v>

2377
01:09:53.710 --> 01:09:55.290
<v Speaker 2>Sugar's addictive is I bet it is.</v>

2378
01:09:55.650 --> 01:09:56.010
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2379
01:09:56.010 --> 01:09:57.610
<v Speaker 2>and the brain scans sugars.</v>

2380
01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:02.090
<v Speaker 2>It's the refining of everything and the extracting of anything that's changed</v>

2381
01:10:02.091 --> 01:10:02.541
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>

2382
01:10:02.541 --> 01:10:02.781
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2383
01:10:02.781 --> 01:10:07.781
<v Speaker 2>Like sugar is a giant moment in human history when sugar becomes important</v>

2384
01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:12.800
<v Speaker 2>because then rum becomes important than slavery and taking over the new world</v>

2385
01:10:12.801 --> 01:10:13.551
<v Speaker 2>and the,</v>

2386
01:10:13.551 --> 01:10:13.761
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2387
01:10:13.761 --> 01:10:18.140
<v Speaker 2>the whole history of the new world is built on cocaine and sugar.</v>

2388
01:10:18.390 --> 01:10:19.130
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2389
01:10:19.130 --> 01:10:19.731
<v Speaker 2>for sure.</v>

2390
01:10:19.731 --> 01:10:20.990
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's,</v>

2391
01:10:21.050 --> 01:10:25.520
<v Speaker 2>there's definitely good and bad with all sorts of things that have ruined all</v>

2392
01:10:25.521 --> 01:10:27.020
<v Speaker 2>sorts of aspects of our world.</v>

2393
01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:27.351
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

2394
01:10:27.351 --> 01:10:29.440
<v Speaker 2>for a long time people go to war for salt.</v>

2395
01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:30.170
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

2396
01:10:30.170 --> 01:10:30.540
<v Speaker 2>Saul,</v>

2397
01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:34.460
<v Speaker 2>stop and think about precedes sugar as the big item that everybody has to have.</v>

2398
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:39.070
<v Speaker 2>So first march was it to the salt marshes because that's what he's purchasing</v>

2399
01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:40.610
<v Speaker 2>the British fuck.</v>

2400
01:10:40.730 --> 01:10:44.840
<v Speaker 2>It's salt's a key ingredient in human history.</v>

2401
01:10:44.841 --> 01:10:45.190
<v Speaker 2>And,</v>

2402
01:10:45.190 --> 01:10:47.690
<v Speaker 2>and people still say it and now I'm getting boring,</v>

2403
01:10:47.691 --> 01:10:49.220
<v Speaker 2>but I was just gonna say when they used to pay,</v>

2404
01:10:49.250 --> 01:10:50.520
<v Speaker 2>they paid people in Salt,</v>

2405
01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:52.460
<v Speaker 2>you're in salt and you're worth your salt.</v>

2406
01:10:52.490 --> 01:10:53.840
<v Speaker 2>The reason what do you know why they do it?</v>

2407
01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:54.081
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

2408
01:10:54.081 --> 01:10:55.520
<v Speaker 2>what's all the properties of salt?</v>

2409
01:10:56.130 --> 01:10:58.970
<v Speaker 2>It absolutely replenishes your body when you're,</v>

2410
01:10:59.180 --> 01:10:59.780
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2411
01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:00.381
<v Speaker 2>working out.</v>

2412
01:11:00.381 --> 01:11:02.570
<v Speaker 2>And I guess the sodium is some sort of no,</v>

2413
01:11:02.571 --> 01:11:02.871
<v Speaker 2>go on.</v>

2414
01:11:02.871 --> 01:11:05.030
<v Speaker 2>Tell us it sounds or I'm stumbling around now.</v>

2415
01:11:05.031 --> 01:11:05.870
<v Speaker 2>Those are all good.</v>

2416
01:11:05.871 --> 01:11:08.390
<v Speaker 2>But the big one is a preservation of food.</v>

2417
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:11.750
<v Speaker 2>If you could take me and my cover and salt and fish,</v>

2418
01:11:11.751 --> 01:11:12.584
<v Speaker 2>especially,</v>

2419
01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:13.830
<v Speaker 2>you cover it in salt,</v>

2420
01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:15.720
<v Speaker 1>it'll prevent bacteria from growing,</v>

2421
01:11:16.260 --> 01:11:16.980
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2422
01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:17.221
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2423
01:11:17.221 --> 01:11:22.221
<v Speaker 1>So they would literally layer these fish filets in stacks of,</v>

2424
01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:23.190
<v Speaker 1>of salt.</v>

2425
01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:24.570
<v Speaker 1>Like they would put salt,</v>

2426
01:11:24.690 --> 01:11:25.590
<v Speaker 1>put the fish down,</v>

2427
01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:26.800
<v Speaker 1>cover the fish with salt,</v>

2428
01:11:26.801 --> 01:11:27.541
<v Speaker 1>put a filet down,</v>

2429
01:11:27.541 --> 01:11:29.700
<v Speaker 1>cover that with salt and they would be fine.</v>

2430
01:11:29.701 --> 01:11:30.840
<v Speaker 1>Like for days,</v>

2431
01:11:31.650 --> 01:11:32.011
<v Speaker 1>months,</v>

2432
01:11:32.011 --> 01:11:32.560
<v Speaker 1>you could ship.</v>

2433
01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:33.500
<v Speaker 1>That's how that's all.</v>

2434
01:11:33.510 --> 01:11:34.950
<v Speaker 1>All food was kept in those days.</v>

2435
01:11:35.210 --> 01:11:36.420
<v Speaker 1>It really lasts for months.</v>

2436
01:11:36.460 --> 01:11:36.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2437
01:11:36.750 --> 01:11:38.130
<v Speaker 1>that horrible stuff all day.</v>

2438
01:11:38.131 --> 01:11:38.460
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2439
01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:39.370
<v Speaker 1>you know that they saw him,</v>

2440
01:11:39.371 --> 01:11:39.751
<v Speaker 1>cod,</v>

2441
01:11:39.751 --> 01:11:40.051
<v Speaker 1>salt,</v>

2442
01:11:40.051 --> 01:11:40.910
<v Speaker 1>cod and salt pork,</v>

2443
01:11:40.920 --> 01:11:41.220
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2444
01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:44.610
<v Speaker 1>You'd be salt the dickens out of the pork and then just keep it forever,</v>

2445
01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:46.080
<v Speaker 1>isn't it under refrigeration?</v>

2446
01:11:46.081 --> 01:11:46.300
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

2447
01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:51.300
<v Speaker 1>So salt provided refrigeration for 10,000 zillion years and it was how you kept</v>

2448
01:11:51.361 --> 01:11:51.780
<v Speaker 1>food.</v>

2449
01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:52.051
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2450
01:11:52.051 --> 01:11:54.330
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was like people can't to this day go,</v>

2451
01:11:54.331 --> 01:11:56.400
<v Speaker 1>what do you just pour your salt on your French fries?</v>

2452
01:11:56.430 --> 01:11:57.720
<v Speaker 1>People go to war for that shit.</v>

2453
01:11:57.870 --> 01:11:58.471
<v Speaker 1>It's a condiment.</v>

2454
01:11:58.471 --> 01:11:59.550
<v Speaker 1>You don't go to war for condiments,</v>

2455
01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:00.870
<v Speaker 1>but that's not what it was.</v>

2456
01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:02.510
<v Speaker 1>It was like going to Wal for refrigerator.</v>

2457
01:12:02.511 --> 01:12:04.110
<v Speaker 1>Harry met Sally in ancient Rome.</v>

2458
01:12:04.111 --> 01:12:06.240
<v Speaker 1>The big sauce was this fish sauce.</v>

2459
01:12:06.241 --> 01:12:08.040
<v Speaker 1>It tastes a lot like Vietnamese fish tacos.</v>

2460
01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:09.480
<v Speaker 1>Very salty and Brown.</v>

2461
01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:13.650
<v Speaker 1>And it was like rendered fish that they let it sit and then they through salt in</v>

2462
01:12:13.651 --> 01:12:14.040
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

2463
01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:14.873
<v Speaker 1>but it kept,</v>

2464
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:15.661
<v Speaker 1>wow.</v>

2465
01:12:15.661 --> 01:12:16.160
<v Speaker 1>He kept,</v>

2466
01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:16.650
<v Speaker 1>he could,</v>

2467
01:12:16.650 --> 01:12:18.570
<v Speaker 1>he could have it on your shelf for a couple of weeks,</v>

2468
01:12:18.571 --> 01:12:19.770
<v Speaker 1>which in the ancient world,</v>

2469
01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:21.240
<v Speaker 1>you're buying food every day.</v>

2470
01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:22.980
<v Speaker 1>You're taking your bread to the baker,</v>

2471
01:12:22.981 --> 01:12:24.270
<v Speaker 1>the bigger breaks that you bring it back.</v>

2472
01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:24.451
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2473
01:12:24.451 --> 01:12:25.920
<v Speaker 1>all of that has to be done on the day,</v>

2474
01:12:25.921 --> 01:12:26.131
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

2475
01:12:26.131 --> 01:12:27.150
<v Speaker 1>You have to check in or whatever.</v>

2476
01:12:27.660 --> 01:12:30.960
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to the supermarket and putting shit in the fridge for a billion</v>

2477
01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:31.110
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

2478
01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:32.070
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

2479
01:12:32.071 --> 01:12:33.330
<v Speaker 1>you don't have a deep freezer.</v>

2480
01:12:33.331 --> 01:12:34.780
<v Speaker 1>We knew keep pot pies,</v>

2481
01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:35.690
<v Speaker 1>salt in cities,</v>

2482
01:12:36.030 --> 01:12:36.571
<v Speaker 1>like you said,</v>

2483
01:12:36.571 --> 01:12:36.880
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2484
01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:41.040
<v Speaker 1>the world flood over solve for ages and amazing to think about today,</v>

2485
01:12:41.070 --> 01:12:43.620
<v Speaker 1>people were forced to work in salt mines and died in them.</v>

2486
01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:45.810
<v Speaker 1>That was like a huge punishment for ages.</v>

2487
01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:48.120
<v Speaker 1>There's a mountain in Germany,</v>

2488
01:12:48.150 --> 01:12:49.440
<v Speaker 1>there's a mountain of salt.</v>

2489
01:12:50.190 --> 01:12:50.851
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

2490
01:12:50.851 --> 01:12:54.420
<v Speaker 1>It's been redeeming Audi yet there's a book called salt and it's very good.</v>

2491
01:12:54.890 --> 01:12:56.340
<v Speaker 1>Will you look up the book called Salt,</v>

2492
01:12:56.341 --> 01:13:00.030
<v Speaker 1>the guy who wrote it and they reduced it just because of the world's need for</v>

2493
01:13:00.031 --> 01:13:00.331
<v Speaker 1>salt.</v>

2494
01:13:00.331 --> 01:13:00.500
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2495
01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:00.841
<v Speaker 1>They just,</v>

2496
01:13:00.841 --> 01:13:01.001
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2497
01:13:01.001 --> 01:13:02.100
<v Speaker 1>they dug it all down.</v>

2498
01:13:02.350 --> 01:13:03.110
<v Speaker 1>Like there was a,</v>

2499
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:05.940
<v Speaker 1>there's two mountains and one in South America I can't remember in the other.</v>

2500
01:13:05.941 --> 01:13:08.760
<v Speaker 1>And Mexico's it in Potosi and uh,</v>

2501
01:13:08.880 --> 01:13:09.061
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

2502
01:13:09.061 --> 01:13:09.511
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>

2503
01:13:09.511 --> 01:13:10.790
<v Speaker 1>Salt a world history.</v>

2504
01:13:10.791 --> 01:13:14.220
<v Speaker 1>You really like it now because he it down and he shows you the salt mines and</v>

2505
01:13:14.221 --> 01:13:15.900
<v Speaker 1>there's pictures of the Salt Mountain and,</v>

2506
01:13:15.901 --> 01:13:16.500
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2507
01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:18.690
<v Speaker 1>and it has UN fucking believable.</v>

2508
01:13:18.691 --> 01:13:19.051
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2509
01:13:19.051 --> 01:13:20.700
<v Speaker 1>we were talking earlier today,</v>

2510
01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:24.900
<v Speaker 1>we were talking earlier today about not having a smartphone would a big leap</v>

2511
01:13:24.901 --> 01:13:26.520
<v Speaker 1>that would be to go back to a flip phone,</v>

2512
01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:29.820
<v Speaker 1>but look at the fuck people fought over salt.</v>

2513
01:13:30.570 --> 01:13:33.000
<v Speaker 1>That is so alien and spices,</v>

2514
01:13:33.001 --> 01:13:33.270
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2515
01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:35.040
<v Speaker 1>The reason why Columbus was coming there,</v>

2516
01:13:35.041 --> 01:13:40.041
<v Speaker 1>it is that the reason why a Columbus was a mountain of salt w w came and I</v>

2517
01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:42.110
<v Speaker 1>didn't always talking about Columbus even bloody show that it,</v>

2518
01:13:42.570 --> 01:13:43.321
<v Speaker 1>even Magellan.</v>

2519
01:13:43.321 --> 01:13:44.400
<v Speaker 1>And when he went around the world,</v>

2520
01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:44.730
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2521
01:13:44.730 --> 01:13:45.840
<v Speaker 1>he sent five ships.</v>

2522
01:13:46.230 --> 01:13:46.501
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

2523
01:13:46.501 --> 01:13:47.460
<v Speaker 1>they lost all of them.</v>

2524
01:13:47.461 --> 01:13:49.230
<v Speaker 1>They finally came back with one three years later,</v>

2525
01:13:49.231 --> 01:13:49.410
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2526
01:13:49.410 --> 01:13:50.310
<v Speaker 1>Three years later.</v>

2527
01:13:50.580 --> 01:13:53.100
<v Speaker 1>But crappy shit with 18 guys sailed back in.</v>

2528
01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:53.581
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2529
01:13:53.581 --> 01:13:54.960
<v Speaker 1>it all been underwritten by,</v>

2530
01:13:55.270 --> 01:13:56.103
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2531
01:13:56.310 --> 01:13:57.600
<v Speaker 1>businessmen from Germany,</v>

2532
01:13:57.630 --> 01:13:57.961
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2533
01:13:57.961 --> 01:14:00.030
<v Speaker 1>Who underwrote Magellan's voyage.</v>

2534
01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:03.390
<v Speaker 1>There was enough spice in that ship to pay for the whole trip.</v>

2535
01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:07.560
<v Speaker 1>A three year trip and losing 300 guys and five ships or whatever,</v>

2536
01:14:07.561 --> 01:14:08.250
<v Speaker 1>four ships.</v>

2537
01:14:08.250 --> 01:14:10.920
<v Speaker 1>Whoa there was it because they brought back what,</v>

2538
01:14:10.930 --> 01:14:11.351
<v Speaker 1>like why,</v>

2539
01:14:11.351 --> 01:14:13.870
<v Speaker 1>don't know what they wanted on that one nutmeg or whatever it was.</v>

2540
01:14:14.040 --> 01:14:19.040
<v Speaker 1>And they had to go all the way around the world to on would east indies,</v>

2541
01:14:19.790 --> 01:14:21.010
<v Speaker 1>no electricity.</v>

2542
01:14:21.070 --> 01:14:23.980
<v Speaker 1>But she see that was the difference was Magellan was going to prove you could go</v>

2543
01:14:23.981 --> 01:14:24.814
<v Speaker 1>that way.</v>

2544
01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:30.640
<v Speaker 1>Cause usually they went around India and the horn and so that's how valuable it</v>

2545
01:14:31.001 --> 01:14:31.241
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

2546
01:14:31.241 --> 01:14:33.300
<v Speaker 1>And that's why uh,</v>

2547
01:14:33.450 --> 01:14:34.270
<v Speaker 1>England,</v>

2548
01:14:34.270 --> 01:14:37.810
<v Speaker 1>Portugal and Spain were such giant powers,</v>

2549
01:14:37.811 --> 01:14:38.950
<v Speaker 1>the big spice.</v>

2550
01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:41.530
<v Speaker 1>And then when Spain took over the new world,</v>

2551
01:14:41.531 --> 01:14:43.000
<v Speaker 1>there was a mountains of gold,</v>

2552
01:14:43.090 --> 01:14:43.970
<v Speaker 1>one in South American,</v>

2553
01:14:43.990 --> 01:14:45.070
<v Speaker 1>one a mountain of silver,</v>

2554
01:14:45.071 --> 01:14:49.510
<v Speaker 1>I mean a mountain of silver that they made the Indians and killed them all.</v>

2555
01:14:49.511 --> 01:14:50.260
<v Speaker 1>Doing it.</v>

2556
01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:55.180
<v Speaker 1>Dig Out and all the gold and silver in Asia is still in circulation is like</v>

2557
01:14:55.330 --> 01:14:58.150
<v Speaker 1>Spanish gold dug out of the new world.</v>

2558
01:14:58.210 --> 01:14:59.200
<v Speaker 1>That's insane.</v>

2559
01:14:59.201 --> 01:15:00.440
<v Speaker 1>There was a literal Mt.</v>

2560
01:15:00.441 --> 01:15:01.150
<v Speaker 1>Two of them.</v>

2561
01:15:01.150 --> 01:15:04.100
<v Speaker 1>One in South America and one in Mexico types.</v>

2562
01:15:04.110 --> 01:15:05.620
<v Speaker 1>So credible a mountain.</v>

2563
01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:06.431
<v Speaker 1>Fuck.</v>

2564
01:15:06.431 --> 01:15:07.870
<v Speaker 1>It's not that long ago either.</v>

2565
01:15:07.871 --> 01:15:08.141
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

2566
01:15:08.141 --> 01:15:10.570
<v Speaker 1>1492 Columbus sailed the ocean blue.</v>

2567
01:15:10.650 --> 01:15:12.310
<v Speaker 1>That's not that long.</v>

2568
01:15:12.311 --> 01:15:13.240
<v Speaker 1>500 years ago.</v>

2569
01:15:13.360 --> 01:15:14.560
<v Speaker 1>That's crazy.</v>

2570
01:15:14.561 --> 01:15:15.394
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2571
01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:20.520
<v Speaker 1>That's why Spain is a had money and why giant and then comes the,</v>

2572
01:15:21.071 --> 01:15:21.570
<v Speaker 1>the uh,</v>

2573
01:15:21.570 --> 01:15:22.241
<v Speaker 1>what you might call it,</v>

2574
01:15:22.241 --> 01:15:27.241
<v Speaker 1>the reformation and after the inquisition and now Europe becomes Europe and they</v>

2575
01:15:27.491 --> 01:15:32.491
<v Speaker 1>all start fighting each other and it's really truly amazing what a small amount</v>

2576
01:15:33.401 --> 01:15:38.050
<v Speaker 1>of time that is in terms of like in perspective with the human history,</v>

2577
01:15:38.290 --> 01:15:38.861
<v Speaker 1>human history,</v>

2578
01:15:38.861 --> 01:15:40.140
<v Speaker 1>just even perspective with it.</v>

2579
01:15:40.150 --> 01:15:42.220
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants to go to the beginning of the universe.</v>

2580
01:15:42.221 --> 01:15:43.670
<v Speaker 1>13.7 billion.</v>

2581
01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:44.710
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>

2582
01:15:44.710 --> 01:15:45.850
<v Speaker 1>we don't even have to go that far.</v>

2583
01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:47.110
<v Speaker 1>Let's go to biological life.</v>

2584
01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:47.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2585
01:15:47.471 --> 01:15:49.720
<v Speaker 1>And then human beings have been around just a small amount of time.</v>

2586
01:15:49.721 --> 01:15:51.130
<v Speaker 1>And in that small amount of time,</v>

2587
01:15:51.131 --> 01:15:56.131
<v Speaker 1>the amount of change that we've seen just in 200 years is so mind blowing.</v>

2588
01:15:57.280 --> 01:16:00.070
<v Speaker 1>And we're talking about like going back to flip phones being like some big,</v>

2597
01:16:11.200 --> 01:16:12.700

2607
01:16:29.770 --> 01:16:31.450
<v Speaker 1>What are the things you thought we lost?</v>

2618
01:16:49.360 --> 01:16:52.960
<v Speaker 1>If you didn't have blacksmiths 250 years ago in this country,</v>

2619
01:16:52.961 --> 01:16:53.794
<v Speaker 1>even a hundred years ago,</v>

2620
01:16:53.800 --> 01:16:55.090
<v Speaker 1>a wagon,</v>

2621

<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2625
01:16:58.030 --> 01:16:58.691
<v Speaker 1>your guns,</v>

2626
01:16:58.691 --> 01:16:59.231
<v Speaker 1>the tongs,</v>

2627
01:16:59.231 --> 01:17:00.280
<v Speaker 1>the tools you worked with,</v>

2628
01:17:00.460 --> 01:17:03.750
<v Speaker 1>you had to take it into him and he'd fix it and he'd give it back to this</v>

2629
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:04.970
<v Speaker 1>something really quick.</v>

2630
01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:06.670
<v Speaker 1>Carrying swords and spears.</v>

2631
01:17:06.671 --> 01:17:07.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

2632
01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:08.770
<v Speaker 1>on paper.</v>

2633
01:17:08.770 --> 01:17:09.710
<v Speaker 1>Something really cool about that,</v>

2634
01:17:09.711 --> 01:17:10.070
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2635
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:12.200
<v Speaker 2>Someone in your group had to be a metal worker,</v>

2636
01:17:12.230 --> 01:17:12.930
<v Speaker 2>you know what I mean?</v>

2637
01:17:12.930 --> 01:17:15.920
<v Speaker 2>Someone in your unit worked metal and you'd heat up a thing at night and bang,</v>

2638
01:17:15.921 --> 01:17:16.101
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>

2639
01:17:16.101 --> 01:17:16.281
<v Speaker 2>Bang,</v>

2640
01:17:16.281 --> 01:17:17.300
<v Speaker 2>fix everybody's guns.</v>

2641
01:17:17.301 --> 01:17:20.030
<v Speaker 2>And there's a guy who made your furniture.</v>

2642
01:17:20.530 --> 01:17:24.740
<v Speaker 2>It was a guy with a to the wood and sawed it down and make your table.</v>

2643
01:17:24.770 --> 01:17:25.460
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

2644
01:17:25.460 --> 01:17:26.201
<v Speaker 2>By Ham Day.</v>

2645
01:17:26.201 --> 01:17:26.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2646
01:17:26.810 --> 01:17:27.350
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

2647
01:17:27.350 --> 01:17:30.440
<v Speaker 2>And everybody's table was a slightly different because they really were just</v>

2648
01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:32.150
<v Speaker 2>marking it with pencils,</v>

2649
01:17:32.210 --> 01:17:34.880
<v Speaker 2>song into the wood and you could see sometimes.</v>

2650
01:17:34.890 --> 01:17:36.290
<v Speaker 2>Then you got to places like when they have,</v>

2651
01:17:36.350 --> 01:17:36.870
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2652
01:17:36.870 --> 01:17:38.240
<v Speaker 2>our artisans making,</v>

2653
01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:39.480
<v Speaker 2>I don't know,</v>

2654
01:17:39.480 --> 01:17:39.730
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

2655
01:17:39.730 --> 01:17:42.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm not going to go to a revolutionary ward village to watch them churn,</v>

2656
01:17:42.321 --> 01:17:43.011
<v Speaker 2>butter or nothing,</v>

2657
01:17:43.011 --> 01:17:44.030
<v Speaker 2>but I don't like,</v>

2658
01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:47.990
<v Speaker 2>like super stupid old school and making shit with your hands.</v>

2659
01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:48.741
<v Speaker 2>But I'm,</v>

2660
01:17:48.741 --> 01:17:51.980
<v Speaker 2>I love when I love watching people make sure that I don't even give a fuck</v>

2661
01:17:51.981 --> 01:17:52.190
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>

2662
01:17:52.190 --> 01:17:52.340
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

2663
01:17:52.340 --> 01:17:53.121
<v Speaker 2>Like violins.</v>

2664
01:17:53.121 --> 01:17:53.954
<v Speaker 2>I don't play the violin,</v>

2665
01:17:54.200 --> 01:17:58.700
<v Speaker 2>but I watched some show about them making violins and the wood did they choose</v>

2666
01:17:58.701 --> 01:18:00.440
<v Speaker 2>and the harmonics of the wood and the,</v>

2667
01:18:00.770 --> 01:18:05.480
<v Speaker 2>I mean when you look at a really truly expensive violin,</v>

2668
01:18:05.540 --> 01:18:08.290
<v Speaker 2>I mean that is a goddamn functional workable.</v>

2669
01:18:08.590 --> 01:18:09.423
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

2670
01:18:09.430 --> 01:18:10.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't even,</v>

2671
01:18:10.010 --> 01:18:10.430
<v Speaker 2>I don't even,</v>

2672
01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:11.570
<v Speaker 2>I don't play any instruments.</v>

2673
01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:12.140
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

2674
01:18:12.140 --> 01:18:13.460
<v Speaker 2>And I think the musicians you buy,</v>

2675
01:18:13.461 --> 01:18:17.540
<v Speaker 2>those hot high end ones are reverent about there.</v>

2676
01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:20.540
<v Speaker 2>They definitely whacks him down and you know,</v>

2677
01:18:20.600 --> 01:18:23.090
<v Speaker 2>keep them in shape and the moisture's in issue,</v>

2678
01:18:23.091 --> 01:18:23.924
<v Speaker 2>you can,</v>

2679
01:18:24.200 --> 01:18:24.470
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2680
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:27.020
<v Speaker 2>store it in a crappy place and it can't get bounced around.</v>

2681
01:18:27.021 --> 01:18:28.160
<v Speaker 2>And while I was at um,</v>

2682
01:18:28.190 --> 01:18:30.140
<v Speaker 2>Conan with Sturgill Simpson,</v>

2683
01:18:30.141 --> 01:18:31.490
<v Speaker 2>Sturgill Simpson is a friend of mine,</v>

2684
01:18:31.491 --> 01:18:36.491
<v Speaker 2>he's a country music guy and he was performing on the show and they asked him if</v>

2685
01:18:37.041 --> 01:18:42.041
<v Speaker 2>he wanted to put his guitar out there early so that it can acclimate to the,</v>

2686
01:18:42.901 --> 01:18:43.241
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

2687
01:18:43.241 --> 01:18:47.210
<v Speaker 2>the temperature in that room because they keep the room where they fill in</v>

2688
01:18:47.220 --> 01:18:48.380
<v Speaker 2>Coleman any five degrees,</v>

2689
01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:49.190
<v Speaker 2>she would chilly.</v>

2690
01:18:49.190 --> 01:18:50.060
<v Speaker 2>So that everybody's like,</v>

2691
01:18:50.061 --> 01:18:50.630
<v Speaker 2>whoa.</v>

2692
01:18:50.630 --> 01:18:52.880
<v Speaker 2>It gives you like a little bit more energy as an audience.</v>

2693
01:18:52.881 --> 01:18:56.180
<v Speaker 2>Like if the worst thing you want is people like really warm and really tired.</v>

2694
01:18:56.530 --> 01:18:56.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

2695
01:18:56.750 --> 01:18:59.090
<v Speaker 2>So you give him like a little bit of a chill and that's like such an old,</v>

2696
01:18:59.120 --> 01:18:59.631
<v Speaker 2>old school,</v>

2697
01:18:59.631 --> 01:19:00.530
<v Speaker 2>David Letterman Trek,</v>

2698
01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:01.220
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2699
01:19:01.220 --> 01:19:05.210
<v Speaker 2>So they put his guitar out there early so we can get you and then they have to</v>

2700
01:19:05.211 --> 01:19:06.080
<v Speaker 2>tune it again.</v>

2701
01:19:06.270 --> 01:19:07.400
<v Speaker 2>So you have to go out there,</v>

2702
01:19:07.550 --> 01:19:08.480
<v Speaker 2>you have to play with it,</v>

2703
01:19:08.590 --> 01:19:12.370
<v Speaker 2>you have to know where it should be for every single note and you,</v>

2704
01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:13.970
<v Speaker 2>you're twisting those little things on top.</v>

2705
01:19:13.971 --> 01:19:14.660
<v Speaker 2>And I'm like,</v>

2706
01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:19.660
<v Speaker 2>the wood itself moves and changes in 10 20 minutes and humidity of the room.</v>

2707
01:19:20.660 --> 01:19:21.800
<v Speaker 2>That's fucking bananas,</v>

2708
01:19:21.801 --> 01:19:22.070
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

2709
01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:27.070
<v Speaker 2>That is so crazy to think that it's so specialized and they can't make,</v>

2710
01:19:27.531 --> 01:19:31.100
<v Speaker 2>he was telling me that you can't make a really good guitar out of anything other</v>

2711
01:19:31.101 --> 01:19:31.890
<v Speaker 2>than wood.</v>

2712
01:19:31.890 --> 01:19:32.930
<v Speaker 2>Just doesn't sound right.</v>

2713
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:35.090
<v Speaker 2>They can make some electric ones.</v>

2714
01:19:35.091 --> 01:19:36.940
<v Speaker 2>I like plexiglass and a shit and they,</v>

2715
01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:38.420
<v Speaker 2>but it's a different sort of a thing.</v>

2716
01:19:38.421 --> 01:19:39.111
<v Speaker 2>But even then,</v>

2717
01:19:39.111 --> 01:19:39.944
<v Speaker 2>not as good,</v>

2718
01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:41.470
<v Speaker 2>like you want blood,</v>

2719
01:19:41.471 --> 01:19:41.661
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

2720
01:19:41.661 --> 01:19:42.380
<v Speaker 2>And they're steel.</v>

2721
01:19:42.380 --> 01:19:43.820
<v Speaker 2>There's the ones that are all metal,</v>

2722
01:19:43.970 --> 01:19:44.803
<v Speaker 2>you know?</v>

2723
01:19:45.290 --> 01:19:45.690
<v Speaker 2>But yeah.</v>

2724
01:19:45.690 --> 01:19:46.970
<v Speaker 2>Now what is the one,</v>

2725
01:19:47.180 --> 01:19:47.571
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

2726
01:19:47.571 --> 01:19:47.960
<v Speaker 2>I met,</v>

2727
01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:50.180
<v Speaker 2>I met a good guy who made guitars for people and he,</v>

2728
01:19:50.181 --> 01:19:50.840
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

2729
01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:54.570
<v Speaker 2>he looked exactly like you think he would with ponytail and a beard and you</v>

2730
01:19:54.571 --> 01:19:54.650
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

2731
01:19:54.650 --> 01:19:55.640
<v Speaker 2>like he's in the hall that,</v>

2732
01:19:55.641 --> 01:20:00.290
<v Speaker 2>and that's how they did it was I was with John Paul Jones,</v>

2733

2735
01:20:02.901 --> 01:20:03.290
<v Speaker 2>he,</v>

2736
01:20:03.290 --> 01:20:07.000
<v Speaker 2>he was in them crooked vultures with Dave Grohl and I got to meet him in,</v>

2737
01:20:07.650 --> 01:20:08.370
<v Speaker 2>he introduces</v>

2738
01:20:08.370 --> 01:20:09.540
<v Speaker 3>me to this fellow and he's like,</v>

01:20:09.930 --> 01:20:10.141
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2740
01:20:10.141 --> 01:20:10.591
<v Speaker 3>who's this guy?</v>

2741
01:20:10.591 --> 01:20:11.424
<v Speaker 3>And he's like,</v>

2742
01:20:11.610 --> 01:20:14.610
<v Speaker 3>he makes Madeline's Whoa.</v>

2743
01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:15.510
<v Speaker 3>And I'm like,</v>

2744
01:20:15.510 --> 01:20:15.721
<v Speaker 3>oh.</v>

2745
01:20:15.721 --> 01:20:16.381
<v Speaker 3>And he's now,</v>

2746
01:20:16.381 --> 01:20:16.891
<v Speaker 3>he's my friend.</v>

2747
01:20:16.891 --> 01:20:17.750
<v Speaker 3>I brought him along with me.</v>

2748
01:20:17.751 --> 01:20:19.980
<v Speaker 3>He makes guitars and mandolins and that's what I plan.</v>

2749
01:20:20.340 --> 01:20:21.000
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

2750
01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:21.540
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2751
01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:22.373
<v Speaker 3>That's all he did.</v>

2752
01:20:22.650 --> 01:20:25.170
<v Speaker 3>And then people have like this really intense relationship with the guy who</v>

2753
01:20:25.171 --> 01:20:26.004
<v Speaker 3>makes their guitar.</v>

2754
01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:26.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2755
01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:26.640
<v Speaker 3>I know.</v>

2756
01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:29.940
<v Speaker 3>Due to Gush Acoustic guitars from like famous makers,</v>

2757
01:20:29.941 --> 01:20:31.680
<v Speaker 3>they become friends with that famous maker.</v>

2758
01:20:32.070 --> 01:20:32.630
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2759
01:20:32.630 --> 01:20:32.950
<v Speaker 3>this is a,</v>

2760
01:20:32.950 --> 01:20:35.520
<v Speaker 3>this is how pool cue thing to pull cues,</v>

2761
01:20:35.521 --> 01:20:36.061
<v Speaker 3>which are also,</v>

2762
01:20:36.061 --> 01:20:38.280
<v Speaker 3>they can't figure out a way to make them really good at anything other than</v>

2763
01:20:38.281 --> 01:20:38.640
<v Speaker 3>wood.</v>

2764
01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:39.180
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2765
01:20:39.180 --> 01:20:40.060
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting that,</v>

2766
01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:42.270
<v Speaker 3>and they have relationships with the makers.</v>

2767
01:20:42.271 --> 01:20:43.560
<v Speaker 3>Like guys who play with certain guys.</v>

2768
01:20:43.561 --> 01:20:43.951
<v Speaker 3>Karen's,</v>

2769
01:20:43.951 --> 01:20:44.161
<v Speaker 3>you're like,</v>

2770
01:20:44.161 --> 01:20:44.371
<v Speaker 3>well look,</v>

2771
01:20:44.371 --> 01:20:46.200
<v Speaker 3>it was really close friendship with this guy.</v>

2772
01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:47.280
<v Speaker 3>I'll make sure cue.</v>

2773
01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:48.120
<v Speaker 3>But uh,</v>

2774
01:20:48.120 --> 01:20:48.953
<v Speaker 3>the um,</v>

2775
01:20:49.710 --> 01:20:52.080
<v Speaker 3>it's interesting to me that like they haven't,</v>

2776
01:20:52.110 --> 01:20:55.740
<v Speaker 3>no one's been able to figure out in all the years that we've been manufacturing</v>

2777
01:20:55.741 --> 01:20:56.310
<v Speaker 3>things,</v>

2778
01:20:56.310 --> 01:21:00.450
<v Speaker 3>something that's better than something that just grows in the ground.</v>

2779
01:21:00.540 --> 01:21:03.690
<v Speaker 3>That's a trip that for guitars,</v>

2780
01:21:03.810 --> 01:21:04.770
<v Speaker 3>for pool cues,</v>

2781
01:21:05.420 --> 01:21:06.211
<v Speaker 3>for this table,</v>

2782
01:21:06.211 --> 01:21:06.900
<v Speaker 3>man,</v>

2783
01:21:06.900 --> 01:21:08.610
<v Speaker 3>this table feels good.</v>

2784
01:21:08.790 --> 01:21:12.120
<v Speaker 3>Like when I put my hand on this tape and I feel the grain of it and I move like</v>

2785
01:21:12.810 --> 01:21:13.470
<v Speaker 3>this is like,</v>

2786
01:21:13.470 --> 01:21:15.780
<v Speaker 3>I think this table makes a better conversation.</v>

2787
01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:16.673
<v Speaker 3>I really do.</v>

2788
01:21:16.740 --> 01:21:17.310
<v Speaker 3>I think if this,</v>

2789
01:21:17.310 --> 01:21:21.420
<v Speaker 3>if there was this plastic thing here with I go like one of the formica top,</v>

2790
01:21:21.690 --> 01:21:23.970
<v Speaker 3>I think we'd feel less comfortable.</v>

2791
01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:24.390
<v Speaker 3>Now you're,</v>

2792
01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:25.350
<v Speaker 3>then you're in a break room.</v>

2793
01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:25.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2794
01:21:25.890 --> 01:21:27.240
<v Speaker 3>Then you're not meant to stay.</v>

2795
01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:27.930
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2796
01:21:27.930 --> 01:21:29.380
<v Speaker 3>You're meant to blow after 15 we,</v>

2797
01:21:29.390 --> 01:21:30.390
<v Speaker 3>even these bricks,</v>

2798
01:21:30.510 --> 01:21:31.860
<v Speaker 3>these bricks are bullshit.</v>

2799
01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:32.190
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2800
01:21:32.190 --> 01:21:33.510
<v Speaker 3>But they're not bullshit.</v>

2801
01:21:33.630 --> 01:21:34.800
<v Speaker 3>They're actual bricks.</v>

2802
01:21:35.090 --> 01:21:36.330
<v Speaker 3>There's a slice,</v>

2803
01:21:36.331 --> 01:21:38.070
<v Speaker 3>they take a brick and they'd veneer.</v>

2804
01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:38.460
<v Speaker 3>Really?</v>

2805
01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:38.761
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2806
01:21:38.761 --> 01:21:39.331
<v Speaker 3>And then they put it,</v>

2807
01:21:39.331 --> 01:21:40.110
<v Speaker 3>they put a wooden,</v>

2808
01:21:40.110 --> 01:21:44.430
<v Speaker 3>a metal sheet up and then they put the SPAC all in or whatever the fuck it is.</v>

2809
01:21:44.580 --> 01:21:45.930
<v Speaker 3>And then they put the bricks in.</v>

2810
01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:48.090
<v Speaker 3>If they lay them one at a time.</v>

2811
01:21:48.330 --> 01:21:49.163
<v Speaker 3>Individually.</v>

2812
01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:49.531
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2813
01:21:49.531 --> 01:21:50.640
<v Speaker 3>Like it's not like a,</v>

2814
01:21:50.641 --> 01:21:52.200
<v Speaker 3>like a wallpaper.</v>

2815
01:21:52.350 --> 01:21:53.071
<v Speaker 3>It's an actual,</v>

2816
01:21:53.071 --> 01:21:53.940
<v Speaker 3>their actual bricks.</v>

2817
01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:55.410
<v Speaker 3>But to me was like,</v>

2818
01:21:55.820 --> 01:21:57.000
<v Speaker 3>I know that's real.</v>

2819
01:21:57.150 --> 01:21:59.310
<v Speaker 3>So if I go back there and touch that feels like,</v>

2820
01:21:59.750 --> 01:22:03.600
<v Speaker 3>that feels like a real organic thing and bricks or you know what?</v>

2821
01:22:03.601 --> 01:22:06.390
<v Speaker 3>Mud and composite and all sorts of shit thrown into a mold.</v>

2822
01:22:06.391 --> 01:22:08.250
<v Speaker 3>You still have to mold and they're all irregular.</v>

2823
01:22:08.310 --> 01:22:10.500
<v Speaker 3>I would have a wooden floor if,</v>

2824
01:22:10.501 --> 01:22:11.010
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2825
01:22:11.010 --> 01:22:12.750
<v Speaker 3>if I own this place I would change it.</v>

2826
01:22:12.810 --> 01:22:14.760
<v Speaker 3>I would turn the flu maybe too nosy for studio.</v>

2827
01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:16.930
<v Speaker 3>Gives a fuck all low,</v>

2828
01:22:16.970 --> 01:22:17.640
<v Speaker 3>low.</v>

2829
01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:18.360
<v Speaker 3>Let it echo.</v>

2830
01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:18.960
<v Speaker 3>I would,</v>

2831
01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:19.860
<v Speaker 3>I would feel better.</v>

2832
01:22:20.340 --> 01:22:22.790
<v Speaker 3>I feel better with like shit that's like,</v>

2833
01:22:23.260 --> 01:22:24.780
<v Speaker 3>like organic stuff.</v>

2834
01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:25.440
<v Speaker 3>I agree.</v>

2835
01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:27.450
<v Speaker 3>Like if you could be in a grow room,</v>

2836
01:22:27.480 --> 01:22:29.190
<v Speaker 3>that would be the ultimate conversation.</v>

2837
01:22:29.610 --> 01:22:31.980
<v Speaker 3>If you could just do a podcast,</v>

2838
01:22:31.981 --> 01:22:36.030
<v Speaker 3>a video podcast from a grow room without going to jail or without getting your</v>

2839
01:22:36.031 --> 01:22:38.190
<v Speaker 3>place stormed by people that you know.</v>

2840
01:22:38.191 --> 01:22:38.401
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

2841
01:22:38.401 --> 01:22:39.930
<v Speaker 3>there's $1 million worth of plants there.</v>

2842
01:22:39.990 --> 01:22:42.600
<v Speaker 3>You're already getting me put in jail and how your questions today.</v>

2843
01:22:42.660 --> 01:22:43.493
<v Speaker 3>Not True.</v>

2844
01:22:44.190 --> 01:22:45.510
<v Speaker 3>We live in a new day.</v>

2845
01:22:46.050 --> 01:22:49.260
<v Speaker 3>Like if you could go to one of those Warren Buffet owned grow rooms in Colorado</v>

2846
01:22:49.261 --> 01:22:51.210
<v Speaker 3>with I five indoor acres.</v>

2847
01:22:51.540 --> 01:22:55.800
<v Speaker 3>They have like five indoor acre ones at this dude I know works out and they have</v>

2848
01:22:55.801 --> 01:22:56.491
<v Speaker 3>two levels.</v>

2849
01:22:56.491 --> 01:23:01.491
<v Speaker 3>There's an upper and a lower Carlo bottles taken shit to the next level son and</v>

2850
01:23:02.490 --> 01:23:03.660
<v Speaker 3>it just got back from Denver.</v>

2851
01:23:03.750 --> 01:23:05.130
<v Speaker 3>That is the beginning.</v>

2852
01:23:05.170 --> 01:23:07.510
<v Speaker 3>There's the beginning for the whole country.</v>

2853
01:23:07.511 --> 01:23:09.250
<v Speaker 3>The whole country is going to become that.</v>

2854
01:23:09.490 --> 01:23:12.400
<v Speaker 3>The whole country is going to become just like Colorado because they're going to</v>

2855
01:23:12.401 --> 01:23:15.370
<v Speaker 3>get addicted to the revenue and then they're going to get addicted to the</v>

2856
01:23:15.371 --> 01:23:16.204
<v Speaker 3>behavior.</v>

2857
01:23:16.360 --> 01:23:17.590
<v Speaker 3>The revenue is one thing,</v>

2858
01:23:17.591 --> 01:23:19.030
<v Speaker 3>but you go to Colorado right now,</v>

2859
01:23:19.031 --> 01:23:21.520
<v Speaker 3>you have a less drunk driving accidents.</v>

2860
01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:24.460
<v Speaker 3>You have less violent crime.</v>

2861
01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:29.480
<v Speaker 3>You have the lowest incident of Duis and something like 25 years there.</v>

2862
01:23:29.550 --> 01:23:33.300
<v Speaker 3>There's all sorts of like positive benefits to what the fuck's going on here.</v>

2863
01:23:33.340 --> 01:23:35.080
<v Speaker 3>You're almost answering the next question,</v>

2864
01:23:35.081 --> 01:23:36.400
<v Speaker 3>which is why isn't it happening everywhere?</v>

2865
01:23:36.401 --> 01:23:36.671
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

2866
01:23:36.671 --> 01:23:37.270
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

2867
01:23:37.270 --> 01:23:38.980
<v Speaker 3>if they're going to sell less alcohol,</v>

2868
01:23:38.981 --> 01:23:42.250
<v Speaker 3>then there's definitely forces that don't want to sell and only that.</v>

2869
01:23:42.251 --> 01:23:42.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

2870
01:23:42.400 --> 01:23:44.260
<v Speaker 3>you've got to worry about the criminals like the,</v>

2871
01:23:44.261 --> 01:23:48.000
<v Speaker 3>I know someone who has a set up where he has blackwater type duties.</v>

2872
01:23:48.310 --> 01:23:51.190
<v Speaker 3>There's these dudes have bulletproof vests and they walk around with the machine</v>

2873
01:23:51.191 --> 01:23:55.070
<v Speaker 3>guns and they're outside of this grow room because they're dealing with millions</v>

2874
01:23:55.070 --> 01:23:58.900
<v Speaker 3>of dollars and million and the banking laws because the banking laws are still</v>

2875
01:23:58.901 --> 01:23:59.734
<v Speaker 3>archaic.</v>

2876
01:23:59.750 --> 01:24:02.140
<v Speaker 3>They are dealing in a cash basis in Colorado.</v>

2877
01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:04.570
<v Speaker 3>He pay cash money like you do here in California.</v>

2878
01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:09.900
<v Speaker 3>So every dispensary's you know got way too much money because they can't use</v>

2879
01:24:10.061 --> 01:24:13.240
<v Speaker 3>credit cards cause and then what did they do when they take it to the bank banks</v>

2880
01:24:13.241 --> 01:24:16.250
<v Speaker 3>down except more than $10,000 yeah.</v>

2881
01:24:16.750 --> 01:24:21.190
<v Speaker 3>Well that's also what's going on with these asset forfeiture laws that are also</v>

2882
01:24:21.191 --> 01:24:22.024
<v Speaker 3>being,</v>

2883
01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:23.350
<v Speaker 3>one of them got overturned.</v>

2884
01:24:23.351 --> 01:24:23.741
<v Speaker 3>What did we say,</v>

2885
01:24:23.741 --> 01:24:25.150
<v Speaker 3>Tennessee we talked about the other day.</v>

2886
01:24:25.630 --> 01:24:28.570
<v Speaker 3>It got overturned in Tennessee where they were stealing people's money.</v>

2887
01:24:28.571 --> 01:24:28.960
<v Speaker 3>Man.</v>

2888
01:24:28.960 --> 01:24:32.140
<v Speaker 3>People were driving somewhere like say if you wanted to buy a car and you had</v>

2889
01:24:32.141 --> 01:24:33.470
<v Speaker 3>$7,000 on you and you,</v>

2890
01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:35.890
<v Speaker 3>you left your house with like this money that you save for a long time.</v>

2891
01:24:36.070 --> 01:24:37.720
<v Speaker 3>If they pull you over and they go,</v>

2892
01:24:37.721 --> 01:24:39.610
<v Speaker 3>why do you have $7,000 on new?</v>

2893
01:24:39.611 --> 01:24:39.881
<v Speaker 3>And you're like,</v>

2894
01:24:39.881 --> 01:24:40.480
<v Speaker 3>Whoa,</v>

2895
01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:42.940
<v Speaker 3>but her car like the fuck Outta here.</v>

2896
01:24:42.941 --> 01:24:47.370
<v Speaker 3>They would just take that money and then you would have to prove somehow talked</v>

2897
01:24:47.510 --> 01:24:48.700
<v Speaker 3>theft is theft.</v>

2898
01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:49.960
<v Speaker 3>It's not only just daft,</v>

2899
01:24:49.961 --> 01:24:52.260
<v Speaker 3>but they would spend that money on any,</v>

2900
01:24:52.310 --> 01:24:53.350
<v Speaker 3>it goes into a bank vault.</v>

2901
01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:55.900
<v Speaker 3>They spent it in the most ironic way.</v>

2902
01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:58.560
<v Speaker 3>They bought a fucking Margarita machine and they,</v>

2903
01:24:58.561 --> 01:24:58.761
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2904
01:24:58.761 --> 01:25:02.230
<v Speaker 3>they were using this Margarita machine at a cop party.</v>

2905
01:25:02.530 --> 01:25:04.780
<v Speaker 3>So you use the drug money.</v>

2906
01:25:04.781 --> 01:25:06.100
<v Speaker 3>Have you thought someone was selling drugs?</v>

2907
01:25:06.101 --> 01:25:10.180
<v Speaker 3>You took it and then you bought a fucking Margarita machine with this wow.</v>

2908
01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:10.631
<v Speaker 3>To do,</v>

2909
01:25:10.631 --> 01:25:11.140
<v Speaker 3>give her,</v>

2910
01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:13.000
<v Speaker 3>give yourselves legal drugs.</v>

2911
01:25:13.270 --> 01:25:16.300
<v Speaker 3>Like you took drug money to buy some drug machines.</v>

2912
01:25:16.900 --> 01:25:18.670
<v Speaker 3>It's unbelievably gross.</v>

2913
01:25:18.830 --> 01:25:19.390
<v Speaker 3>Careless.</v>

2914
01:25:19.390 --> 01:25:19.631
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

2915
01:25:19.631 --> 01:25:20.141
<v Speaker 3>Well that's,</v>

2916
01:25:20.141 --> 01:25:20.500
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

2917
01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:23.950
<v Speaker 3>that's part of what they were doing in California with the medical marijuana.</v>

2918
01:25:24.430 --> 01:25:26.650
<v Speaker 3>Medical marijuana is a state legal thing.</v>

2919
01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:29.410
<v Speaker 3>So these places we're following all the state laws.</v>

2920
01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:31.060
<v Speaker 3>They got licenses to open.</v>

2921
01:25:31.180 --> 01:25:31.901
<v Speaker 3>They opened up,</v>

2922
01:25:31.901 --> 01:25:33.760
<v Speaker 3>they even went through this whole dispute where they said,</v>

2923
01:25:33.761 --> 01:25:33.941
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

2924
01:25:33.941 --> 01:25:35.440
<v Speaker 3>a lot of you are too close to schools.</v>

2925
01:25:35.630 --> 01:25:36.520
<v Speaker 3>You've got to close down.</v>

2926
01:25:36.521 --> 01:25:40.060
<v Speaker 3>There's always a legislation that got passed and a lot of pot stores had to get</v>

2927
01:25:40.061 --> 01:25:40.780
<v Speaker 3>closed down.</v>

2928
01:25:40.780 --> 01:25:42.070
<v Speaker 3>Even after that,</v>

2929
01:25:42.071 --> 01:25:43.510
<v Speaker 3>the DEA came in,</v>

2930
01:25:43.930 --> 01:25:44.290
<v Speaker 3>they,</v>

2931
01:25:44.290 --> 01:25:47.050
<v Speaker 3>Jack booted these fucking kids that were working there.</v>

2932
01:25:47.051 --> 01:25:47.411
<v Speaker 3>There's one,</v>

2933
01:25:47.411 --> 01:25:49.420
<v Speaker 3>there were these guys stepping on his kid's neck.</v>

2934
01:25:49.780 --> 01:25:51.700
<v Speaker 3>The kid is totally being compliant.</v>

2935
01:25:51.701 --> 01:25:52.960
<v Speaker 3>They got 'em zip tied on the ground.</v>

2936
01:25:53.140 --> 01:25:55.180
<v Speaker 3>He steps on his neck when he gets off of him.</v>

2937
01:25:55.390 --> 01:25:55.631
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

2938
01:25:55.631 --> 01:26:00.310
<v Speaker 3>it's fucked up to what I get enraged when I see that.</v>

2939
01:26:00.311 --> 01:26:03.010
<v Speaker 3>I want to beat the fuck out of that guy for doing that.</v>

2940
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:03.321
<v Speaker 3>Just,</v>

2941
01:26:03.321 --> 01:26:04.370
<v Speaker 3>it's so horrible.</v>

2942
01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:07.130
<v Speaker 3>And I think if that was your son or your daughter,</v>

2943
01:26:07.131 --> 01:26:11.390
<v Speaker 3>some 20 year old college kid who gets their head stepped on by some fucking</v>

2944
01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:12.080
<v Speaker 3>cunt,</v>

2945
01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:16.070
<v Speaker 3>well they would steal the money and then they would say that the charges are</v>

2946
01:26:16.071 --> 01:26:17.660
<v Speaker 3>pending and never file.</v>

2947
01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:21.860
<v Speaker 3>So that three quarters of $1 million that they stole from your pot place and</v>

2948
01:26:21.861 --> 01:26:22.640
<v Speaker 3>you're only working,</v>

2949
01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:23.930
<v Speaker 3>you're making 20 bucks an hour,</v>

2950
01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:27.860
<v Speaker 3>whatever work in there and they're stepping on your fucking neck and zip tying</v>

2951
01:26:27.861 --> 01:26:29.660
<v Speaker 3>your wrists until you have cuts on them.</v>

2952
01:26:29.930 --> 01:26:30.530
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

2953
01:26:30.530 --> 01:26:31.790
<v Speaker 3>for what and you don't even,</v>

2954
01:26:31.791 --> 01:26:34.400
<v Speaker 3>you're not even violating a fucking federal law will.</v>

2955
01:26:34.401 --> 01:26:34.911
<v Speaker 3>The last,</v>

2956
01:26:34.911 --> 01:26:35.210
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

2957
01:26:35.210 --> 01:26:36.290
<v Speaker 3>d head of the Ge,</v>

2958
01:26:36.291 --> 01:26:37.130
<v Speaker 3>I just resigned.</v>

2959
01:26:37.730 --> 01:26:38.940
<v Speaker 3>And a god,</v>

2960
01:26:39.170 --> 01:26:41.240
<v Speaker 3>that woman was very bad about pot.</v>

2961
01:26:41.300 --> 01:26:42.920
<v Speaker 3>She was awful at this number.</v>

2962
01:26:42.921 --> 01:26:43.754
<v Speaker 3>Look at this number.</v>

2963
01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:49.120
<v Speaker 3>In 2012 Texas law enforcement and prosecutors ended the year with $143 million</v>

2964
01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:56.480
<v Speaker 3>in your honors for accounts.</v>

2965
01:26:57.200 --> 01:26:59.180
<v Speaker 3>143 million.</v>

2966
01:26:59.210 --> 01:27:04.210
<v Speaker 3>40,007 talking about this is what's wrapped about everything that is</v>

2967
01:27:04.701 --> 01:27:05.780
<v Speaker 3>unbelievable.</v>

2968
01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:06.490
<v Speaker 3>This is the,</v>

2969
01:27:06.490 --> 01:27:07.550
<v Speaker 3>this one year,</v>

2970
01:27:07.700 --> 01:27:11.390
<v Speaker 3>the state of Texas law enforcement preying on the people of state of stealing</v>

2971
01:27:11.391 --> 01:27:15.980
<v Speaker 3>from the people stealing $143 million just in a year.</v>

2972
01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:18.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry I interrupted you about that DEA late 80,</v>

2973
01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:19.133
<v Speaker 3>late or not at all.</v>

2974
01:27:19.190 --> 01:27:21.150
<v Speaker 3>What's ironic is that she got put under,</v>

2975
01:27:21.170 --> 01:27:21.521
<v Speaker 3>you know what,</v>

2976
01:27:21.521 --> 01:27:24.500

2977
01:27:24.560 --> 01:27:25.070
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

2978
01:27:25.070 --> 01:27:26.060
<v Speaker 3>The Dea had,</v>

2979
01:27:26.390 --> 01:27:28.010
<v Speaker 3>they were hiring like secret service.</v>

2980
01:27:28.011 --> 01:27:28.731
<v Speaker 3>They had a little fun,</v>

2981
01:27:28.731 --> 01:27:32.170
<v Speaker 3>good service and the DEA were having fun and another coach.</v>

2982
01:27:32.190 --> 01:27:32.580
<v Speaker 3>What's,</v>

2983
01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:33.231
<v Speaker 3>what the fuck.</v>

2984
01:27:33.231 --> 01:27:34.064
<v Speaker 3>Leave him alone.</v>

2985
01:27:35.030 --> 01:27:38.360
<v Speaker 3>She got taken down for that and she is not very progressive and I'm hoping that</v>

2986
01:27:38.361 --> 01:27:41.930
<v Speaker 3>the attorney general is blamed for handling of agents,</v>

2987
01:27:41.931 --> 01:27:43.010
<v Speaker 3>sex parties with hookers.</v>

2988
01:27:43.250 --> 01:27:45.650
<v Speaker 3>Can't they just have a little fun off the job?</v>

2989
01:27:45.710 --> 01:27:46.540
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

2990
01:27:46.540 --> 01:27:50.510
<v Speaker 3>Manny's got damn nannies as long as they weren't using state money.</v>

2991
01:27:50.690 --> 01:27:51.050
<v Speaker 3>I mean we're,</v>

2992
01:27:51.050 --> 01:27:51.920
<v Speaker 3>where'd the money go?</v>

2993
01:27:52.010 --> 01:27:52.371
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

2994
01:27:52.371 --> 01:27:57.371
<v Speaker 3>with money with the DEA is not exactly the most organized division of our</v>

2995
01:27:57.801 --> 01:27:58.634
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>

2996
01:27:58.660 --> 01:28:02.390
<v Speaker 3>What we've played that Jared was a Jared Polis was the representative of</v>

2997
01:28:02.391 --> 01:28:07.391
<v Speaker 3>Colorado who is grilling her on what is more addictive marijuana or crystal meth</v>

2998
01:28:07.790 --> 01:28:10.310
<v Speaker 3>was more directive that marijuana or heroin,</v>

2999
01:28:10.400 --> 01:28:11.570
<v Speaker 3>what is worse for you?</v>

3000
01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:15.590
<v Speaker 3>I think that all drugs and he'd just kind of asking her what is,</v>

3001
01:28:15.591 --> 01:28:16.340
<v Speaker 3>what is worse?</v>

3002
01:28:16.340 --> 01:28:18.920
<v Speaker 3>Is marijuana as bad as crystal meth?</v>

3003
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:19.820
<v Speaker 3>Can you just answer that?</v>

3004
01:28:20.120 --> 01:28:20.953
<v Speaker 3>I think</v>

3005
01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:28.060
<v Speaker 3>all illegal drugs are bad and it's like the most maddening fucking bureaucratic</v>

3006
01:28:29.091 --> 01:28:30.950
<v Speaker 3>red tape horseshit conversation.</v>

3007
01:28:30.980 --> 01:28:31.460
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3008
01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:34.220
<v Speaker 3>That was the house he never fess up and she should change.</v>

3009

01:28:40.401 --> 01:28:41.750
<v Speaker 3>the window of her office,</v>

3011
01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:46.520
<v Speaker 3>denying of reality that's going on right in front of and not only that,</v>

3012
01:28:46.850 --> 01:28:51.380

<v Speaker 3>If you don't have a guy like Jared Polis,</v>

3058
01:30:07.740 --> 01:30:08.970
<v Speaker 3>a guy who just grills her,</v>

<v Speaker 3>it makes her look like a fool and doesn't do it in a,</v>

3060
01:30:11.110 --> 01:30:13.230
<v Speaker 3>I mean he's not being an asshole about it.</v>

3061
01:30:13.231 --> 01:30:18.000
<v Speaker 3>He's not being mean or he's not pointing fingers and yelling and using hyperbole</v>

3062
01:30:18.001 --> 01:30:19.440
<v Speaker 3>and theater.</v>

<v Speaker 3>shocking use of the post though.</v>

3065
01:30:22.260 --> 01:30:25.980
<v Speaker 3>I mean they make you the head of the DEA and you're supposed to be in a semi</v>

3066
01:30:25.981 --> 01:30:29.070
<v Speaker 3>progressive government and who do you report to?</v>

3067
01:30:29.070 --> 01:30:31.910
<v Speaker 3>The president or Eric Holder or whoever it is and,</v>

3068
01:30:31.950 --> 01:30:33.030
<v Speaker 3>but that's the hustle.</v>

3069
01:30:33.090 --> 01:30:35.370
<v Speaker 3>The hustle is that this is a semi progressive government,</v>

3070
01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:36.600
<v Speaker 3>but it is no such thing.</v>

3071
01:30:36.630 --> 01:30:37.650
<v Speaker 3>They don't exist anymore.</v>

3072
01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:40.290
<v Speaker 3>You can't get in there if you're semi progressive union,</v>

3073
01:30:40.310 --> 01:30:40.980
<v Speaker 3>you can't,</v>

3074
01:30:40.980 --> 01:30:44.100
<v Speaker 3>you can put on the semi semi progressive tee shirt when you're running for</v>

3075
01:30:44.101 --> 01:30:44.600
<v Speaker 3>office.</v>

3076
01:30:44.600 --> 01:30:45.090
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3077
01:30:45.090 --> 01:30:47.190
<v Speaker 3>But when they had a redact all that shit from the,</v>

3078
01:30:47.191 --> 01:30:47.550
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3079
01:30:47.550 --> 01:30:51.450
<v Speaker 3>the hope and change or whatever the fuck his website was about whistleblowers</v>

3080
01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:53.880
<v Speaker 3>when people after the Edward Snowden thing where like,</v>

3081
01:30:53.881 --> 01:30:54.601
<v Speaker 3>hey man,</v>

3082
01:30:54.601 --> 01:30:57.960
<v Speaker 3>do you remember what you said that you were going to honor them and uh,</v>

3083
01:30:57.961 --> 01:31:00.480
<v Speaker 3>and they were important part of the process and blah blah blah.</v>

3084
01:31:00.510 --> 01:31:00.721
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3085
01:31:00.721 --> 01:31:01.291
<v Speaker 3>What the fuck.</v>

3086
01:31:01.291 --> 01:31:02.460
<v Speaker 3>And they just pull all that stuff.</v>

3087
01:31:02.461 --> 01:31:02.941
<v Speaker 3>It's all,</v>

3088
01:31:02.941 --> 01:31:03.870
<v Speaker 3>it's a dance.</v>

3089
01:31:04.030 --> 01:31:04.621
<v Speaker 3>It's a dance.</v>

3090
01:31:04.621 --> 01:31:08.400
<v Speaker 3>Everyone essentially who gets into office has the same master.</v>

3091
01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:09.480
<v Speaker 3>They all have the same mass.</v>

3092
01:31:09.510 --> 01:31:10.440
<v Speaker 3>Oh no question of that.</v>

3093
01:31:10.590 --> 01:31:11.760
<v Speaker 3>But I think we were saying about pot,</v>

3094
01:31:12.070 --> 01:31:12.510
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3095
01:31:12.510 --> 01:31:15.060
<v Speaker 3>the thing people are going to get addicted to is the money.</v>

3096
01:31:15.130 --> 01:31:15.820
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3097

3099
01:31:21.211 --> 01:31:22.590
<v Speaker 3>it's just spinning money for them.</v>

3100
01:31:22.950 --> 01:31:24.870
<v Speaker 3>And I said on my show last week,</v>

3101
01:31:25.380 --> 01:31:28.260
<v Speaker 3>they can't have a bake sale and make this money.</v>

<v Speaker 3>There's the state that kind of revenue is like found.</v>

3103
01:31:31.300 --> 01:31:31.800
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3104
01:31:31.800 --> 01:31:32.530
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

3105
01:31:32.530 --> 01:31:32.900
<v Speaker 3>Andy,</v>

3106
01:31:32.900 --> 01:31:34.440
<v Speaker 3>you don't have to open a casino.</v>

3107
01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:35.281

<v Speaker 3>I mean it's just,</v>

3110
01:31:37.471 --> 01:31:38.030
<v Speaker 3>I dunno,</v>

3111
01:31:38.030 --> 01:31:42.360
<v Speaker 3>I find it a lot more acceptable and progressive than building casinos in bars</v>

3112
01:31:42.361 --> 01:31:42.780
<v Speaker 3>everywhere.</v>

3113
01:31:42.780 --> 01:31:42.880
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

01:31:43.111 --> 01:31:44.920
<v Speaker 3>when you see the ebb and the tide of,</v>

3116
01:31:44.950 --> 01:31:46.770
<v Speaker 3>of society and you see,</v>

3117
01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:47.041
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3118
01:31:47.041 --> 01:31:51.540
<v Speaker 3>at one point in time the Republicans were the really open minded progressive</v>

3119
01:31:51.541 --> 01:31:52.290
<v Speaker 3>party.</v>

3120
01:31:52.290 --> 01:31:53.520
<v Speaker 3>That was a long time ago.</v>

3121
01:31:53.521 --> 01:31:55.230
<v Speaker 3>That was what a Republican was,</v>

3122
01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:56.700
<v Speaker 3>what a Republican was,</v>

3123
01:31:56.701 --> 01:31:58.470
<v Speaker 3>was totally different than what a Democrat was.</v>

3124
01:31:58.471 --> 01:32:00.160
<v Speaker 3>There was almost polar opposites.</v>

3125
01:32:00.730 --> 01:32:05.730
<v Speaker 3>And w another thing that you're seeing today really lately like it seems like</v>

3126
01:32:05.951 --> 01:32:10.300
<v Speaker 3>over the last few years is like the people who are progressive probably as a</v>

3127
01:32:10.301 --> 01:32:14.350
<v Speaker 3>reaction to all the assholery that they had to deal with as a young person or</v>

3128
01:32:14.530 --> 01:32:15.080
<v Speaker 3>all the,</v>

3129
01:32:15.080 --> 01:32:16.320
<v Speaker 3>the all the,</v>

3130
01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:21.360
<v Speaker 3>what they believe is the slights and the misappropriation of money for war and</v>

3131
01:32:21.521 --> 01:32:22.450
<v Speaker 3>all the different shit that they're,</v>

3132
01:32:23.140 --> 01:32:24.360
<v Speaker 3>they should be right about,</v>

3133
01:32:24.380 --> 01:32:25.450
<v Speaker 3>they should be angry about.</v>

3134
01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:29.680
<v Speaker 3>But now they're the aggressive ones when it comes to policing speech.</v>

3135
01:32:29.890 --> 01:32:34.540
<v Speaker 3>When it comes to like shielding people from anything that might make me</v>

3136
01:32:34.630 --> 01:32:35.530
<v Speaker 3>uncomfortable.</v>

3137
01:32:35.770 --> 01:32:36.910
<v Speaker 3>Fat Shaming.</v>

3138
01:32:37.090 --> 01:32:37.441
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot of,</v>

3139
01:32:37.441 --> 01:32:41.710
<v Speaker 3>it's crazy talk and really aggressive about it comes from the left now.</v>

3140
01:32:41.950 --> 01:32:42.281
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

3141
01:32:42.281 --> 01:32:43.810
<v Speaker 3>they're the school moms.</v>

3142
01:32:43.930 --> 01:32:44.590
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

3143
01:32:44.590 --> 01:32:44.960
<v Speaker 3>there's,</v>

3144
01:32:44.960 --> 01:32:45.640
<v Speaker 3>it means someone,</v>

3145
01:32:45.640 --> 01:32:47.040
<v Speaker 3>someone wrote that on Twitter.</v>

3146
01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:49.390
<v Speaker 3>I think Christina Summers was,</v>

3147
01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:50.320
<v Speaker 3>I forget the tweet.</v>

3148
01:32:50.370 --> 01:32:52.270
<v Speaker 3>I retweeted it the other day,</v>

3149
01:32:52.271 --> 01:32:54.400
<v Speaker 3>but it was so appropriate because it was exactly that.</v>

3150
01:32:54.850 --> 01:32:55.181
<v Speaker 3>It's like,</v>

3151
01:32:55.181 --> 01:32:55.961
<v Speaker 3>how did this happen?</v>

3152
01:32:55.961 --> 01:32:56.794
<v Speaker 3>It's shifted.</v>

3153
01:32:57.040 --> 01:32:59.560
<v Speaker 3>And then Bruce Jenner goes on TV,</v>

3154
01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:02.950
<v Speaker 3>says he's becoming a woman and he's a Republican.</v>

3155
01:33:03.730 --> 01:33:04.391
<v Speaker 3>And everybody went,</v>

3156
01:33:04.391 --> 01:33:04.780
<v Speaker 3>wait,</v>

3157
01:33:04.780 --> 01:33:05.613
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

3158
01:33:05.700 --> 01:33:07.960
<v Speaker 3>Diane stores reaction was fantastic.</v>

3159
01:33:08.020 --> 01:33:09.040
<v Speaker 3>I cried laughing.</v>

3160
01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:09.993
<v Speaker 3>She went,</v>

3161
01:33:10.140 --> 01:33:10.540
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

3162
01:33:10.540 --> 01:33:11.021
<v Speaker 3>And then she goes,</v>

3163
01:33:11.021 --> 01:33:11.621
<v Speaker 3>you're a republican.</v>

3164
01:33:11.621 --> 01:33:11.981
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

3165
01:33:11.981 --> 01:33:12.800
<v Speaker 3>is there anything wrong with that?</v>

3166
01:33:12.800 --> 01:33:12.990
<v Speaker 3>She said,</v>

3167
01:33:12.990 --> 01:33:13.100
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3168
01:33:13.100 --> 01:33:13.191
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3169
01:33:13.191 --> 01:33:13.301
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3170
01:33:13.301 --> 01:33:13.720
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3171
01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:16.390
<v Speaker 3>So you're going to go to John Bayner and mentioned McConnell.</v>

3172
01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:16.990
<v Speaker 3>And he went,</v>

3173
01:33:16.990 --> 01:33:17.201
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3174
01:33:17.201 --> 01:33:18.011
<v Speaker 3>I do it in a heartbeat.</v>

3175
01:33:18.011 --> 01:33:18.844
<v Speaker 3>And she just went,</v>

3176
01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:20.630
<v Speaker 3>there was a tank of her life.</v>

3177
01:33:21.460 --> 01:33:22.870
<v Speaker 3>You're barking up the wrong tree,</v>

3178
01:33:22.871 --> 01:33:23.171
<v Speaker 3>bro.</v>

3179
01:33:23.171 --> 01:33:24.004
<v Speaker 3>Hames.</v>

3180
01:33:24.100 --> 01:33:24.371
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3181
01:33:24.371 --> 01:33:27.700
<v Speaker 3>he's a an odd case in that unique,</v>

3182
01:33:27.701 --> 01:33:28.270
<v Speaker 3>obviously.</v>

3183
01:33:28.270 --> 01:33:28.630
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

3184
01:33:28.630 --> 01:33:29.411
<v Speaker 3>he's famous.</v>

3185
01:33:29.411 --> 01:33:30.310
<v Speaker 3>He's got a past.</v>

3186
01:33:30.311 --> 01:33:31.660
<v Speaker 3>He's a famous sports star.</v>

3187
01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:33.250
<v Speaker 3>There's a lot going on,</v>

3188
01:33:33.700 --> 01:33:36.010
<v Speaker 3>but I think for transgender people,</v>

3189
01:33:36.011 --> 01:33:37.240
<v Speaker 3>I think it's amazing.</v>

3190
01:33:37.270 --> 01:33:37.450
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

3191
01:33:37.450 --> 01:33:38.290
<v Speaker 3>it's fantastic.</v>

3192
01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:43.560
<v Speaker 3>Two hours on TV and dedicated to this person who's decided to become a woman.</v>

3193
01:33:44.020 --> 01:33:45.010
<v Speaker 3>And then here's the thing,</v>

3194
01:33:45.011 --> 01:33:45.331
<v Speaker 3>someone,</v>

3195
01:33:45.331 --> 01:33:46.164
<v Speaker 3>people will go,</v>

3196
01:33:46.270 --> 01:33:46.721
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

3197
01:33:46.721 --> 01:33:46.961
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3198
01:33:46.961 --> 01:33:47.501
<v Speaker 3>you know what?</v>

3199
01:33:47.501 --> 01:33:50.500
<v Speaker 3>What about the possibility that what he has a mental illness,</v>

3200
01:33:50.980 --> 01:33:52.720
<v Speaker 3>what that is possible.</v>

3201
01:33:52.780 --> 01:33:53.081
<v Speaker 3>Listen,</v>

3202
01:33:53.081 --> 01:33:53.831
<v Speaker 3>it is possible.</v>

3203
01:33:53.831 --> 01:33:54.340
<v Speaker 3>This pie,</v>

3204
01:33:54.340 --> 01:33:56.500
<v Speaker 3>there's all sorts of possibilities when it comes to mental illnesses,</v>

3205
01:33:56.501 --> 01:33:57.311
<v Speaker 3>but that wasn't my point.</v>

3206
01:33:57.311 --> 01:34:01.240
<v Speaker 3>My point is if he has a mental illness in the worst case scenario of the mental</v>

3207
01:34:01.241 --> 01:34:01.990
<v Speaker 3>illnesses,</v>

3208
01:34:01.990 --> 01:34:04.330
<v Speaker 3>he wants to be a woman and then it becomes a woman.</v>

3209
01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:05.860
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

3210
01:34:05.860 --> 01:34:06.693
<v Speaker 3>But he's lesbian.</v>

3211
01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:09.160
<v Speaker 3>That's way better than not Hetero,</v>

3212
01:34:09.161 --> 01:34:09.994
<v Speaker 3>which was weird.</v>

3213
01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:10.241
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3214
01:34:10.241 --> 01:34:10.540
<v Speaker 3>he's a,</v>

3215
01:34:10.540 --> 01:34:13.300
<v Speaker 3>he's going to become a lesbian who he's gunna become a lesbian because he's a</v>

3216
01:34:13.301 --> 01:34:13.790
<v Speaker 3>man.</v>

3217
01:34:13.790 --> 01:34:15.350
<v Speaker 3>He was using he pronouns,</v>

3218
01:34:15.400 --> 01:34:15.730
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

3219
01:34:15.730 --> 01:34:17.590
<v Speaker 3>He wanted to be referred to as Bruce and he,</v>

3220
01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:20.020
<v Speaker 3>so like he has always been a woman.</v>

3221
01:34:20.110 --> 01:34:21.190
<v Speaker 3>So it's very,</v>

3222
01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:22.450
<v Speaker 3>and you know you're supposed to like,</v>

3223
01:34:22.960 --> 01:34:25.450
<v Speaker 3>he's supposed to not questioning that and let people get away with anything when</v>

3224
01:34:25.451 --> 01:34:26.350
<v Speaker 3>it comes to he,</v>

3225
01:34:26.351 --> 01:34:28.090
<v Speaker 3>she gender definitions,</v>

3226
01:34:28.150 --> 01:34:29.710
<v Speaker 3>I guess that would be queer or whatever.</v>

3227
01:34:29.711 --> 01:34:30.251
<v Speaker 3>Whatever it is,</v>

3228
01:34:30.251 --> 01:34:31.630
<v Speaker 3>whatever the fuck he wants it to be.</v>

3229
01:34:31.810 --> 01:34:33.890
<v Speaker 3>The point being why?</v>

3230
01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:34.451
<v Speaker 3>First of all,</v>

3231
01:34:34.451 --> 01:34:36.430
<v Speaker 3>why do you give a shit if he wants to remove his penis or not?</v>

3232
01:34:36.790 --> 01:34:37.780
<v Speaker 3>And second,</v>

3233
01:34:37.870 --> 01:34:40.930
<v Speaker 3>if the worst case scenario is he becomes a woman,</v>

3234
01:34:40.931 --> 01:34:44.770
<v Speaker 3>is it really so bad to be a woman at 65 what fucking difference does it mean</v>

3235
01:34:44.771 --> 01:34:48.070
<v Speaker 3>right at 65 anybody who fucks you is throwing you a bone,</v>

3236
01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:48.910
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3237
01:34:48.910 --> 01:34:49.743
<v Speaker 3>Let's be honest.</v>

3238
01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:50.471
<v Speaker 3>And that's like,</v>

3239
01:34:50.471 --> 01:34:52.180
<v Speaker 3>if you're rushing me,</v>

3240
01:34:52.181 --> 01:34:53.230
<v Speaker 3>I'm sitting right in here.</v>

3241
01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:54.910
<v Speaker 3>If you're going to become a woman,</v>

3242
01:34:54.911 --> 01:34:57.280
<v Speaker 3>that's a pro stop.</v>

3243
01:34:57.290 --> 01:34:58.123
<v Speaker 3>Show me anything.</v>

3244
01:34:58.550 --> 01:34:59.960
<v Speaker 3>If you want to become a woman,</v>

3245
01:34:59.961 --> 01:35:02.690
<v Speaker 3>that's the best time when it's over anyway.</v>

3246
01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:06.140
<v Speaker 3>And we wouldn't be a 65 year old man or a 65 year old woman.</v>

3247
01:35:06.141 --> 01:35:07.190
<v Speaker 3>I don't know what the fuck you dude.</v>

3248
01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:08.570
<v Speaker 3>Just like be a woman now.</v>

3249
01:35:08.630 --> 01:35:09.463
<v Speaker 3>Perfect.</v>

3250
01:35:09.590 --> 01:35:10.960
<v Speaker 3>And you don't even need an operation.</v>

3251
01:35:10.970 --> 01:35:12.350
<v Speaker 3>I thought it was a woman,</v>

3252
01:35:12.410 --> 01:35:15.950
<v Speaker 3>Diane Sawyer or was being pretty good at been interviewing them.</v>

3253
01:35:15.980 --> 01:35:18.530
<v Speaker 3>And then when he said he wanted to be a woman,</v>

3254
01:35:18.531 --> 01:35:19.364
<v Speaker 3>she's like,</v>

3255
01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:21.740
<v Speaker 3>you missed all the good years.</v>

3256
01:35:21.770 --> 01:35:22.221
<v Speaker 3>And I thought,</v>

3257
01:35:22.221 --> 01:35:23.360
<v Speaker 3>that's really sexist.</v>

3258
01:35:23.790 --> 01:35:25.340
<v Speaker 3>You're a 65 year old woman,</v>

3259
01:35:25.490 --> 01:35:26.323
<v Speaker 3>Diane.</v>

3260
01:35:26.330 --> 01:35:29.410
<v Speaker 3>Only that she's basing his value on whether or not,</v>

3261
01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:30.810
<v Speaker 3>and we'll want to have any,</v>

3262
01:35:31.110 --> 01:35:33.170
<v Speaker 3>she all of a sudden she's using the standard that I have.</v>

3263
01:35:33.171 --> 01:35:33.591
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

3264
01:35:33.591 --> 01:35:35.180
<v Speaker 3>She wouldn't want to be judged by if I said,</v>

3265
01:35:35.181 --> 01:35:36.014
<v Speaker 3>well Diane,</v>

3266
01:35:36.050 --> 01:35:39.080
<v Speaker 3>you're over 60 I don't find you as attractive as I did.</v>

3267
01:35:39.110 --> 01:35:39.681
<v Speaker 3>You know what I mean?</v>

3268
01:35:39.681 --> 01:35:40.010
<v Speaker 3>Like,</v>

3269
01:35:40.010 --> 01:35:42.740
<v Speaker 3>and I thought that was really a wild thing to say.</v>

3270
01:35:42.741 --> 01:35:45.590
<v Speaker 3>I mean I understood it because it's a knee jerk reactionary thing to say it like</v>

3271
01:35:45.591 --> 01:35:46.281
<v Speaker 3>what you don't do that,</v>

3272
01:35:46.281 --> 01:35:47.280
<v Speaker 3>you're not going to get the budget.</v>

3273
01:35:47.290 --> 01:35:48.510
<v Speaker 3>You know like right.</v>

3274
01:35:48.530 --> 01:35:49.101
<v Speaker 3>Someone would say,</v>

3275
01:35:49.101 --> 01:35:50.670
<v Speaker 3>but I also thought a,</v>

3276
01:35:50.780 --> 01:35:55.780
<v Speaker 3>you're at New York intellectual media chattering class rich involved person</v>

3277
01:35:56.451 --> 01:35:56.781
<v Speaker 3>type.</v>

3278
01:35:56.781 --> 01:35:57.930
<v Speaker 3>That was a pretty weird reaction.</v>

3279
01:35:57.931 --> 01:35:58.100
<v Speaker 3>Nigga.</v>

3280
01:35:58.100 --> 01:35:59.240
<v Speaker 3>You missed all the good years.</v>

3281
01:35:59.450 --> 01:36:00.770
<v Speaker 3>Especially since she's that age.</v>

3282
01:36:00.860 --> 01:36:01.520
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3283
01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:01.671
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3284
01:36:01.671 --> 01:36:04.610
<v Speaker 3>I think she has the license to say because she's out of course.</v>

3285
01:36:04.611 --> 01:36:05.680
<v Speaker 3>But also it's like,</v>

3286
01:36:05.710 --> 01:36:06.010
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3287
01:36:06.010 --> 01:36:10.320
<v Speaker 3>just highlights how ridiculous the progressive structure of language has be,</v>

3288
01:36:10.670 --> 01:36:11.740
<v Speaker 3>but has to fall into,</v>

3289
01:36:11.750 --> 01:36:12.290
<v Speaker 3>he can't,</v>

3290
01:36:12.290 --> 01:36:14.330
<v Speaker 3>she can't make a joke like that to him about that.</v>

3291
01:36:14.380 --> 01:36:15.140
<v Speaker 3>It's funny.</v>

3292
01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:15.800
<v Speaker 3>It's funny,</v>

3293
01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:16.850
<v Speaker 3>but it was so sexist.</v>

3294
01:36:16.851 --> 01:36:20.090
<v Speaker 3>Like I'm pretty sure that Diet fucking story,</v>

3295
01:36:20.091 --> 01:36:21.650
<v Speaker 3>it's a sexist against women.</v>

3296
01:36:22.130 --> 01:36:23.470
<v Speaker 3>Pretty sure you know,</v>

3297
01:36:23.660 --> 01:36:26.420
<v Speaker 3>you can be God [inaudible] certain no,</v>

3298
01:36:26.421 --> 01:36:27.201
<v Speaker 3>you didn't even,</v>

3299
01:36:27.201 --> 01:36:27.801
<v Speaker 3>you're right.</v>

3300
01:36:27.801 --> 01:36:28.700
<v Speaker 3>And what you said,</v>

3301
01:36:28.730 --> 01:36:30.290
<v Speaker 3>and if you judge everybody by the standards,</v>

3302
01:36:30.291 --> 01:36:34.390
<v Speaker 3>they're like really super progressive complainers will judge people by it</v>

3303
01:36:34.391 --> 01:36:36.800
<v Speaker 3>because there are certain things that people will write blogs about where you</v>

3304
01:36:36.801 --> 01:36:37.190
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

3305
01:36:37.190 --> 01:36:39.230
<v Speaker 3>Jesus fucking Christ,</v>

3306
01:36:39.410 --> 01:36:41.090
<v Speaker 3>will you stop let off.</v>

3307
01:36:41.150 --> 01:36:42.110
<v Speaker 3>Will you just stop?</v>

3308
01:36:42.140 --> 01:36:44.570
<v Speaker 3>This is your being completely ridiculous.</v>

3309
01:36:45.020 --> 01:36:45.831
<v Speaker 3>Like he was one,</v>

3310
01:36:45.831 --> 01:36:48.830
<v Speaker 3>there was a fat shaming one that I tweeted the other day about protein world.</v>

3311
01:36:48.831 --> 01:36:50.150
<v Speaker 3>This thing that's going on in England,</v>

3312
01:36:50.690 --> 01:36:51.320
<v Speaker 3>they have this,</v>

3313
01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:52.040
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3314
01:36:52.040 --> 01:36:53.600
<v Speaker 3>this billboard is in England.</v>

3315
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:56.630
<v Speaker 3>They have this billboard that says,</v>

3316
01:36:56.690 --> 01:36:57.290
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3317
01:36:57.290 --> 01:36:57.830
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3318
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:59.780
<v Speaker 3>is your body beach body ready?</v>

3319
01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:00.261
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah,</v>

3320
01:37:00.261 --> 01:37:00.700
<v Speaker 3>I saw that.</v>

3321
01:37:00.700 --> 01:37:04.640
<v Speaker 3>And there's a girl in a bikini looks really hot and people got angry that they</v>

3322
01:37:04.641 --> 01:37:08.060
<v Speaker 3>were fat shaming that by showing this girl,</v>

3323
01:37:08.061 --> 01:37:09.350
<v Speaker 3>so look at this,</v>

3324
01:37:09.351 --> 01:37:10.240
<v Speaker 3>are you beach body?</v>

3325
01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:10.661
<v Speaker 3>Rather than,</v>

3326
01:37:10.661 --> 01:37:11.491
<v Speaker 3>they took pictures of it.</v>

3327
01:37:11.491 --> 01:37:11.591
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

3328
01:37:11.591 --> 01:37:16.040
<v Speaker 3>And they were facing them fuck off on it and stuff like the protein world about,</v>

3329
01:37:16.041 --> 01:37:16.251
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

3330
01:37:16.251 --> 01:37:17.720
<v Speaker 3>actually that's not true.</v>

3331
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:18.680
<v Speaker 3>What would those be?</v>

3332
01:37:18.681 --> 01:37:19.520
<v Speaker 3>Facings.</v>

3333
01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:21.190
<v Speaker 3>Most of them were photoshops.</v>

3334
01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:23.390
<v Speaker 3>Most of them are people bullshitting.</v>

3335
01:37:23.420 --> 01:37:24.710
<v Speaker 3>And guess I didn't read very carefully.</v>

3336
01:37:24.720 --> 01:37:24.870
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3337
01:37:24.870 --> 01:37:26.840
<v Speaker 3>Well because a lot of social justice warriors,</v>

3338
01:37:26.841 --> 01:37:29.990
<v Speaker 3>it would be really into doing something like that are incredibly socially</v>

3339
01:37:29.991 --> 01:37:30.501
<v Speaker 3>retarded.</v>

3340
01:37:30.501 --> 01:37:30.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

3341
01:37:30.890 --> 01:37:32.510
<v Speaker 3>And they have a lot of,</v>

3342
01:37:32.540 --> 01:37:32.810
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3343
01:37:32.810 --> 01:37:34.550
<v Speaker 3>social anxiety and they're not going to go out.</v>

3344
01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:35.473
<v Speaker 3>Some of them would,</v>

3345
01:37:35.570 --> 01:37:37.280
<v Speaker 3>but they're not going to likely go out,</v>

3346
01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:39.500
<v Speaker 3>paint over this shit,</v>

3347
01:37:39.530 --> 01:37:42.210
<v Speaker 3>new practicing or whatever that uh,</v>

3348
01:37:42.510 --> 01:37:43.370
<v Speaker 3>he was a nice gap.</v>

3349
01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:44.760
<v Speaker 3>The Powell,</v>

3350
01:37:44.840 --> 01:37:45.590
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3351
01:37:45.590 --> 01:37:47.150
<v Speaker 3>the acne cream was,</v>

3352
01:37:47.720 --> 01:37:49.310
<v Speaker 3>isn't this also an unrealistic,</v>

3353
01:37:50.180 --> 01:37:50.431
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

3354
01:37:50.431 --> 01:37:51.230
<v Speaker 3>Awesome body.</v>

3355
01:37:51.230 --> 01:37:51.471
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3356
01:37:51.471 --> 01:37:52.670
<v Speaker 3>it's not if you're that girl,</v>

3357
01:37:52.820 --> 01:37:54.110
<v Speaker 3>but it's genetic.</v>

3358
01:37:54.290 --> 01:37:54.441
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3359
01:37:54.441 --> 01:37:55.201
<v Speaker 3>if you're that girl,</v>

3360
01:37:55.201 --> 01:37:56.040
<v Speaker 3>it's not impossible,</v>

3361
01:37:56.190 --> 01:37:57.210
<v Speaker 3>but it is genetic.</v>

3362
01:37:57.540 --> 01:37:57.871
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

3363
01:37:57.871 --> 01:37:58.081
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

3364
01:37:58.081 --> 01:37:59.280
<v Speaker 3>but we're all,</v>

3365
01:37:59.281 --> 01:38:00.114
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3366
01:38:00.450 --> 01:38:03.420
<v Speaker 3>there's always going to be the perfect looking people and sure everyone will</v>

3367
01:38:03.421 --> 01:38:04.590
<v Speaker 3>always want to look like them.</v>

3368
01:38:04.591 --> 01:38:07.110
<v Speaker 3>And then there's the whole question of that.</v>

3369
01:38:07.111 --> 01:38:08.250
<v Speaker 3>But that's not shaming.</v>

3370
01:38:08.400 --> 01:38:08.910
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

3371
01:38:08.910 --> 01:38:10.350
<v Speaker 3>That is impressive.</v>

3372
01:38:10.470 --> 01:38:11.820
<v Speaker 3>That's inspiring.</v>

3373
01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:13.200
<v Speaker 3>That's inspiring.</v>

3374
01:38:13.201 --> 01:38:13.501
<v Speaker 3>And if there,</v>

3375
01:38:13.501 --> 01:38:15.780
<v Speaker 3>is it because you're attracted to you,</v>

3376
01:38:15.950 --> 01:38:16.411
<v Speaker 3>maybe,</v>

3377
01:38:16.411 --> 01:38:19.260
<v Speaker 3>but if you're a woman and you can possibly look like that,</v>

3378
01:38:19.261 --> 01:38:20.160
<v Speaker 3>which is not all women.</v>

3379
01:38:20.161 --> 01:38:21.600
<v Speaker 3>Some women have odd shaped bodies.</v>

3380
01:38:21.601 --> 01:38:22.440
<v Speaker 3>I was just a fact.</v>

3381
01:38:22.441 --> 01:38:25.260
<v Speaker 3>We've all met women who are boxy or really wide.</v>

3382
01:38:25.261 --> 01:38:25.620
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

3383
01:38:25.620 --> 01:38:27.660
<v Speaker 3>it's probably annoying to them to see shit like that.</v>

3384
01:38:27.900 --> 01:38:28.710
<v Speaker 3>But guess what?</v>

3385
01:38:28.710 --> 01:38:30.930
<v Speaker 3>When that fucking dude who plays Tyrion Lannister,</v>

3386
01:38:30.931 --> 01:38:31.764
<v Speaker 3>what's his name?</v>

3387
01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:32.441
<v Speaker 3>The,</v>

3388
01:38:32.441 --> 01:38:32.691
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3389
01:38:32.691 --> 01:38:33.050
<v Speaker 3>the,</v>

3390
01:38:33.050 --> 01:38:33.750
<v Speaker 3>the guy,</v>

3391
01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:34.830
<v Speaker 3>the small man.</v>

3392
01:38:34.890 --> 01:38:35.640
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

3393
01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:37.080
<v Speaker 3>what does this dude from game of Thrones,</v>

3394
01:38:37.110 --> 01:38:37.943
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>

3395
01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:39.113
<v Speaker 3>What is his name?</v>

3396
01:38:39.390 --> 01:38:40.223
<v Speaker 3>Peter Dinklage.</v>

3397
01:38:40.530 --> 01:38:41.250
<v Speaker 3>Peter Dinklage.</v>

3398
01:38:41.250 --> 01:38:43.520
<v Speaker 3>When Peter Dinklage sees a fucking Abercrombie and Fitch ad,</v>

3399
01:38:43.521 --> 01:38:44.640
<v Speaker 3>but the dude with a six pack,</v>

3400
01:38:44.920 --> 01:38:45.190
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

3401
01:38:45.190 --> 01:38:47.820
<v Speaker 3>with long legs and long arms and shit.</v>

3402
01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:49.380
<v Speaker 3>I bet that freaked him the fuck out too.</v>

3403
01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:54.450
<v Speaker 3>But doesn't mean Abercrombie and Fitch had stopped showing twinks with six packs</v>

3404
01:38:54.451 --> 01:38:55.440
<v Speaker 3>to sell underwear.</v>

3405
01:38:56.210 --> 01:38:57.030
<v Speaker 3>It's fine.</v>

3406
01:38:57.030 --> 01:38:58.680
<v Speaker 3>It's like it's not body shaming.</v>

3407
01:38:58.681 --> 01:38:59.580
<v Speaker 3>It should pressive.</v>

3408
01:38:59.610 --> 01:39:00.443
<v Speaker 3>That's what it is.</v>

3409
01:39:00.510 --> 01:39:01.530
<v Speaker 3>It's unusual.</v>

3410
01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:03.840
<v Speaker 3>It's not the mean that body,</v>

3411
01:39:03.870 --> 01:39:04.620
<v Speaker 3>not the mean.</v>

3412
01:39:04.620 --> 01:39:06.030
<v Speaker 3>Who's got a body like that?</v>

3413
01:39:06.031 --> 01:39:07.230
<v Speaker 3>The woman's got a perfect body.</v>

3414
01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:08.101
<v Speaker 3>That's not normal.</v>

3415
01:39:08.101 --> 01:39:09.540
<v Speaker 3>That's not a lot of people blind.</v>

3416
01:39:09.541 --> 01:39:10.290
<v Speaker 3>She's gray.</v>

3417
01:39:10.290 --> 01:39:11.130
<v Speaker 3>It's not fat shaming.</v>

3418
01:39:11.190 --> 01:39:12.900
<v Speaker 3>Here's a real fucking problem with that.</v>

3419
01:39:12.930 --> 01:39:13.681
<v Speaker 3>Here's the real problem.</v>

3420
01:39:13.681 --> 01:39:14.490
<v Speaker 3>What they're doing,</v>

3421
01:39:14.490 --> 01:39:15.480
<v Speaker 3>they're selling.</v>

3422
01:39:15.750 --> 01:39:17.640
<v Speaker 3>They're selling like some sort of diet plan.</v>

3423
01:39:17.660 --> 01:39:18.230
<v Speaker 3>That was not what it was,</v>

3424
01:39:18.230 --> 01:39:18.481
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

3425
01:39:18.481 --> 01:39:19.320
<v Speaker 3>Isn't that what it is?</v>

3426
01:39:19.440 --> 01:39:20.310
<v Speaker 3>See what it is.</v>

3427
01:39:21.710 --> 01:39:21.980
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>

3428
01:39:21.980 --> 01:39:22.341
<v Speaker 3>What is it?</v>

3429
01:39:22.341 --> 01:39:22.580
<v Speaker 3>If it's,</v>

3430
01:39:22.580 --> 01:39:23.850
<v Speaker 3>is it just protein?</v>

3431
01:39:24.210 --> 01:39:24.850
<v Speaker 3>What's pull?</v>

3432
01:39:24.850 --> 01:39:28.290
<v Speaker 3>Go to the actual thing itself,</v>

3433
01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:30.090
<v Speaker 3>but see where few are so mad,</v>

3434
01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:30.811
<v Speaker 3>like look at that.</v>

3435
01:39:30.811 --> 01:39:33.150
<v Speaker 3>I smashed patriarchy with a hammer.</v>

3436
01:39:33.270 --> 01:39:34.470
<v Speaker 3>I scroll down and look at that.</v>

3437
01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:35.620
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>

3438
01:39:35.620 --> 01:39:36.090
<v Speaker 3>Look at this.</v>

3439
01:39:36.090 --> 01:39:36.871
<v Speaker 3>If I had a hammer,</v>

3440
01:39:36.871 --> 01:39:38.250
<v Speaker 3>I'd smash patriarchy.</v>

3441
01:39:38.251 --> 01:39:39.390
<v Speaker 3>I found it in the hammer.</v>

3442
01:39:39.391 --> 01:39:42.470
<v Speaker 3>Has feminism written on the handle of,</v>

3443
01:39:42.490 --> 01:39:42.840
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

3444
01:39:42.840 --> 01:39:47.840
<v Speaker 3>I just want to tell you that woman in that picture is an actual woman like she</v>

3445
01:39:48.631 --> 01:39:49.620
<v Speaker 3>actually exists.</v>

3446
01:39:50.010 --> 01:39:51.120
<v Speaker 3>That's not fair enough.</v>

3447
01:39:51.140 --> 01:39:54.930
<v Speaker 3>It's not patriarchy because someone wants to look like that.</v>

3448
01:39:55.050 --> 01:39:56.700
<v Speaker 3>She's attractive.</v>

3449
01:39:56.970 --> 01:39:58.830
<v Speaker 3>That is a sexually attractive woman.</v>

3450
01:39:58.831 --> 01:39:59.290
<v Speaker 3>It's not us,</v>

3451
01:39:59.290 --> 01:40:02.550
<v Speaker 3>but our dominant paradigm that depresses us at all times.</v>

3452
01:40:02.551 --> 01:40:03.384
<v Speaker 3>Joe,</v>

3453
01:40:04.020 --> 01:40:05.880
<v Speaker 3>if you decide to look at the world like that,</v>

3454
01:40:05.881 --> 01:40:08.550
<v Speaker 3>you can find absolutely everywhere you go.</v>

3455
01:40:08.940 --> 01:40:12.090
<v Speaker 3>That's why sometimes I think it'd be fun to be a right wing conservative because</v>

3456
01:40:12.450 --> 01:40:12.811
<v Speaker 3>then you,</v>

3457
01:40:12.811 --> 01:40:15.570
<v Speaker 3>you can just blame lots of people for stuff and well,</v>

3458
01:40:15.571 --> 01:40:16.980
<v Speaker 3>how about being a left wing radical?</v>

3459
01:40:17.930 --> 01:40:18.150
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

3460
01:40:18.150 --> 01:40:19.170
<v Speaker 3>it's exactly the same.</v>

3461
01:40:19.171 --> 01:40:20.520
<v Speaker 3>I have all these people in the fray,</v>

3462
01:40:20.521 --> 01:40:21.480
<v Speaker 3>Dev and all these people.</v>

3463
01:40:22.310 --> 01:40:25.530
<v Speaker 3>But you're not so left wing radical or this doesn't make sense to you?</v>

3464
01:40:26.500 --> 01:40:26.720
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3465
01:40:26.720 --> 01:40:29.340
<v Speaker 3>most things make sense if you think about it after awhile.</v>

3466
01:40:30.750 --> 01:40:31.560
<v Speaker 3>I just don't.</v>

3467
01:40:31.560 --> 01:40:35.520
<v Speaker 3>I think that people are absolutely would get uncomfortable if their body could</v>

3468
01:40:35.521 --> 01:40:37.920
<v Speaker 3>never look like that and they would walk by and see that.</v>

3469
01:40:38.190 --> 01:40:39.630
<v Speaker 3>But that's the breaks,</v>

3470
01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:40.291
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3471
01:40:40.291 --> 01:40:41.011
<v Speaker 3>That's just how,</v>

3472
01:40:41.011 --> 01:40:41.730
<v Speaker 3>that's life.</v>

3473
01:40:41.730 --> 01:40:46.730
<v Speaker 3>Life hands you weird cards and if you believe in freedom you believe that</v>

3474
01:40:49.501 --> 01:40:54.160
<v Speaker 3>someone should be able to sell the image of that to</v>

3475
01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:57.520
<v Speaker 2>stand there with the Bikini and use it for their products.</v>

3476
01:40:57.521 --> 01:40:58.100
<v Speaker 2>The prize,</v>

3477
01:40:58.100 --> 01:41:01.390
<v Speaker 2>like no one really product cause no one really did to face the boards.</v>

3478
01:41:01.660 --> 01:41:02.051
<v Speaker 2>It was just,</v>

3479
01:41:02.051 --> 01:41:02.411
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3480
01:41:02.411 --> 01:41:05.510
<v Speaker 2>it's all bullshit because I thought I sell one of those the other day they will</v>

3481
01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:06.353
<v Speaker 2>look some money.</v>

3482
01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:09.100
<v Speaker 2>Some people might have done it,</v>

3483
01:41:09.101 --> 01:41:12.130
<v Speaker 2>but apparently according to the people at protein world,</v>

3484
01:41:12.131 --> 01:41:13.120
<v Speaker 2>they had a state,</v>

3485
01:41:13.600 --> 01:41:14.231
<v Speaker 2>a statement.</v>

3486
01:41:14.231 --> 01:41:15.830
<v Speaker 2>They said that they were all photoshops if they,</v>

3487
01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:19.240
<v Speaker 2>hi Lindsay and I live in French fi world and it's a little bit different in my</v>

3488
01:41:19.241 --> 01:41:19.840
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

3489
01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:20.310
<v Speaker 2>You're,</v>

3490
01:41:20.310 --> 01:41:20.950
<v Speaker 2>you're a little,</v>

3491
01:41:20.950 --> 01:41:22.660
<v Speaker 2>I am beach body ready and French fry world.</v>

3492
01:41:22.880 --> 01:41:25.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm material heirloom tomato world heirloom tomato.</v>

3493
01:41:26.030 --> 01:41:27.100
<v Speaker 2>It's what I live off of.</v>

3494
01:41:27.130 --> 01:41:28.390
<v Speaker 2>Little Balsamic Vinegar,</v>

3495
01:41:28.530 --> 01:41:30.430
<v Speaker 2>a little sea salt sprinkled on top on it.</v>

3496
01:41:30.460 --> 01:41:30.911
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3497
01:41:30.911 --> 01:41:34.030
<v Speaker 2>you don't need that fucking cow shit and just slice through that tomato.</v>

3498
01:41:34.870 --> 01:41:36.340
<v Speaker 2>It's one of the most delicious things in the world.</v>

3499
01:41:36.550 --> 01:41:40.420
<v Speaker 2>Heirloom tomatoes with a little balsamic vinegar and just a little dash of</v>

3500
01:41:40.421 --> 01:41:40.901
<v Speaker 2>Cecil.</v>

3501
01:41:40.901 --> 01:41:42.110
<v Speaker 2>And my wife really likes it,</v>

3502
01:41:42.430 --> 01:41:43.061
<v Speaker 2>so you know what I mean?</v>

3503
01:41:43.061 --> 01:41:43.630
<v Speaker 2>It's beautiful.</v>

3504
01:41:43.630 --> 01:41:43.781
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3505
01:41:43.781 --> 01:41:45.580
<v Speaker 2>tomatoes are supposed to taste like that,</v>

3506
01:41:45.581 --> 01:41:47.790
<v Speaker 2>but those tomatoes last like an hour you,</v>

3507
01:41:47.791 --> 01:41:49.870
<v Speaker 2>you buy heirloom tomatoes from the grocery store.</v>

3508
01:41:49.871 --> 01:41:53.200
<v Speaker 2>Those bitches are good for like a day and then they start getting all mushy.</v>

3509
01:41:53.350 --> 01:41:54.280
<v Speaker 2>But when you eat them,</v>

3510
01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:56.110
<v Speaker 2>you understand that tomatoes are really a fruit.</v>

3511
01:41:56.111 --> 01:41:57.310
<v Speaker 2>That difference between,</v>

3512
01:41:57.530 --> 01:41:58.060
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3513
01:41:58.060 --> 01:41:59.050
<v Speaker 2>the big puffy,</v>

3514
01:41:59.051 --> 01:42:00.940
<v Speaker 2>watery agro farm.</v>

3515
01:42:00.941 --> 01:42:04.360
<v Speaker 2>The hard ones that can travel for weeks.</v>

3516
01:42:04.420 --> 01:42:04.810
<v Speaker 2>They can,</v>

3517
01:42:04.810 --> 01:42:06.040
<v Speaker 2>they bred them that way.</v>

3518
01:42:06.070 --> 01:42:06.910
<v Speaker 2>They bounce,</v>

3519
01:42:07.230 --> 01:42:08.063
<v Speaker 2>they have like,</v>

3520
01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:09.461
<v Speaker 2>they don't take,</v>

3521
01:42:09.461 --> 01:42:10.600
<v Speaker 2>they taste really bland.</v>

3522
01:42:10.650 --> 01:42:11.020
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3523
01:42:11.020 --> 01:42:11.470
<v Speaker 2>Why don't we,</v>

3524
01:42:11.470 --> 01:42:14.210
<v Speaker 2>there's a big difference between those and like the Jersey beef,</v>

3525
01:42:14.211 --> 01:42:14.681
<v Speaker 2>steak,</v>

3526
01:42:14.681 --> 01:42:15.640
<v Speaker 2>tomatoes and old,</v>

3527
01:42:15.790 --> 01:42:17.590
<v Speaker 2>they're old jeans and that's genetically modified.</v>

3528
01:42:17.590 --> 01:42:19.900
<v Speaker 2>Like when people start talking about genetic modifications,</v>

3529
01:42:19.901 --> 01:42:20.351
<v Speaker 2>guess what?</v>

3530
01:42:20.351 --> 01:42:21.184
<v Speaker 2>That's what that is.</v>

3531
01:42:21.490 --> 01:42:24.030
<v Speaker 2>That's what the tomatoes in the corner breeding.</v>

3532
01:42:24.150 --> 01:42:25.060
<v Speaker 2>It's an apples.</v>

3533
01:42:25.090 --> 01:42:27.970
<v Speaker 2>That's why there's only like five kinds of apples instead of a thousand.</v>

3534
01:42:28.420 --> 01:42:28.661
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3535
01:42:28.661 --> 01:42:29.160
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

3536
01:42:29.160 --> 01:42:29.340
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3537
01:42:29.340 --> 01:42:29.980
<v Speaker 2>and they're like,</v>

3538
01:42:29.980 --> 01:42:31.160
<v Speaker 2>girl is fucked too.</v>

3539
01:42:31.250 --> 01:42:33.310
<v Speaker 2>We like five different kinds of potatoes here.</v>

3540
01:42:33.311 --> 01:42:35.290
<v Speaker 2>But in South America obviously,</v>

3541
01:42:35.350 --> 01:42:37.090
<v Speaker 2>where the potato was invented,</v>

3542
01:42:37.510 --> 01:42:39.580
<v Speaker 2>there's thousands of strains.</v>

3543
01:42:39.790 --> 01:42:39.941
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3544
01:42:39.941 --> 01:42:43.570
<v Speaker 2>They have all the different shape and purple and green and all weird different</v>

3545
01:42:43.571 --> 01:42:44.620
<v Speaker 2>operators and shit.</v>

3546
01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:46.400
<v Speaker 2>You ever seen Yukon?</v>

3547
01:42:46.660 --> 01:42:49.750
<v Speaker 2>Like how much is involved in processing that and making food out of it?</v>

3548
01:42:49.790 --> 01:42:50.650
<v Speaker 2>Oh my God.</v>

3549
01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:52.690
<v Speaker 2>How'd he say it?</v>

3550
01:42:52.690 --> 01:42:53.523
<v Speaker 2>I would say Yakka.</v>

3551
01:42:53.830 --> 01:42:54.370
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

3552
01:42:54.370 --> 01:42:55.203
<v Speaker 2>You're probably right.</v>

3553
01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:56.201
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3554
01:42:56.201 --> 01:42:57.040
<v Speaker 2>If I was called porter,</v>

3555
01:42:57.041 --> 01:42:59.160
<v Speaker 2>I'd write a song about that you say.</v>

3556
01:43:00.490 --> 01:43:01.323
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

3557
01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:02.711
<v Speaker 2>But you know,</v>

3558
01:43:02.711 --> 01:43:03.760
<v Speaker 2>it's like on one hand,</v>

3559
01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:04.450
<v Speaker 2>what is that?</v>

3560
01:43:04.450 --> 01:43:05.380
<v Speaker 2>The humble potato?</v>

3561
01:43:05.440 --> 01:43:06.273
<v Speaker 2>That's all the different,</v>

3562
01:43:06.370 --> 01:43:06.761
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah,</v>

3563
01:43:06.761 --> 01:43:07.594
<v Speaker 2>it's a potatoes.</v>

3564
01:43:07.930 --> 01:43:08.261
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

3565
01:43:08.261 --> 01:43:09.100
<v Speaker 2>They look really cool.</v>

3566
01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:09.520
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

3567
01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:13.510
<v Speaker 2>the ink has South America and the American Indians,</v>

3568
01:43:13.610 --> 01:43:14.020
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3569
01:43:14.020 --> 01:43:14.740
<v Speaker 2>and uh,</v>

3570
01:43:14.740 --> 01:43:15.310
<v Speaker 2>on,</v>

3571
01:43:15.310 --> 01:43:15.941
<v Speaker 2>in Moscow,</v>

3572
01:43:15.941 --> 01:43:19.870
<v Speaker 2>in North America invented the horticulture and uh,</v>

3573
01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:21.940
<v Speaker 2>the husbands or eve or whatever you call it,</v>

3574
01:43:21.990 --> 01:43:22.250
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3575
01:43:22.250 --> 01:43:23.620
<v Speaker 2>if potatoes and corn,</v>

3576
01:43:24.610 --> 01:43:28.720
<v Speaker 2>corn was not an edible product till the Indian started planning it and making it</v>

3577
01:43:29.050 --> 01:43:31.690
<v Speaker 2>into something they could eat and they developed it.</v>

3578
01:43:31.691 --> 01:43:32.770
<v Speaker 2>And the ink is an,</v>

3579
01:43:32.771 --> 01:43:37.150
<v Speaker 2>all the tribes that lived in South America and those civilizations developed all</v>

3580
01:43:37.151 --> 01:43:38.680
<v Speaker 2>those potatoes and bread them.</v>

3581
01:43:38.770 --> 01:43:39.521
<v Speaker 2>That's amazing.</v>

3582
01:43:39.521 --> 01:43:40.590
<v Speaker 2>And so it's a,</v>

3583
01:43:40.591 --> 01:43:44.480
<v Speaker 2>it's an extraordinary feat of agriculture.</v>

3584
01:43:44.590 --> 01:43:45.341
<v Speaker 2>The end,</v>

3585
01:43:45.341 --> 01:43:50.341
<v Speaker 2>the fact that potatoes and corn basically saved Europe from starvation in that</v>

3586
01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:51.711
<v Speaker 2>same time period.</v>

3587
01:43:51.711 --> 01:43:54.320
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about when they were able to bring all that back from the new</v>

3588
01:43:54.321 --> 01:43:55.154
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

3589
01:43:55.690 --> 01:43:59.720
<v Speaker 2>Europe wasn't doing so hot with the nutrition right around then because they</v>

3590
01:43:59.721 --> 01:44:01.820
<v Speaker 2>didn't have a lot of vegetables that captain,</v>

3591
01:44:02.270 --> 01:44:02.420
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3592
01:44:02.420 --> 01:44:04.310
<v Speaker 2>potatoes like a perfect vegetable,</v>

3593
01:44:04.311 --> 01:44:04.630
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

3594
01:44:04.630 --> 01:44:04.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3595
01:44:04.950 --> 01:44:08.000
<v Speaker 2>You could actually live on potatoes almost to the exclusion of everything else</v>

3596
01:44:08.001 --> 01:44:10.490
<v Speaker 2>and not die cause it hasn't relied in than in it.</v>

3597
01:44:11.300 --> 01:44:14.570
<v Speaker 2>It's really rich in vitamin C and potassium to d as well.</v>

3598
01:44:14.630 --> 01:44:15.330
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3599
01:44:15.330 --> 01:44:18.040
<v Speaker 2>Data's or like this extraordinary kind of,</v>

3600
01:44:18.170 --> 01:44:19.100
<v Speaker 2>and then what do we do with it?</v>

3601
01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:23.600
<v Speaker 2>We'd take the fucking nutritious part off of it and we boil it and then put salt</v>

3602
01:44:23.601 --> 01:44:23.990
<v Speaker 2>on it.</v>

3603
01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:24.823
<v Speaker 2>It's awesome.</v>

3604
01:44:24.850 --> 01:44:25.520
<v Speaker 2>It's so great.</v>

3605
01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:26.920
<v Speaker 2>Then put it in bleach lessons,</v>

3606
01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:28.250
<v Speaker 2>it ranch dressing and then,</v>

3607
01:44:28.450 --> 01:44:29.670
<v Speaker 2>and like a corn,</v>

3608
01:44:29.671 --> 01:44:29.890
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3609
01:44:29.890 --> 01:44:30.150
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>

3610
01:44:30.150 --> 01:44:32.480
<v Speaker 2>that the whole argument over Gmo corn and everything.</v>

3611
01:44:32.510 --> 01:44:33.343
<v Speaker 2>I was like,</v>

3612
01:44:34.420 --> 01:44:35.253
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3613
01:44:35.680 --> 01:44:36.690
<v Speaker 2>I don't know that.</v>

3614
01:44:37.020 --> 01:44:38.480
<v Speaker 2>And also that GMO corn,</v>

3615
01:44:38.540 --> 01:44:39.373
<v Speaker 2>the stuff that again,</v>

3616
01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:40.190
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

3617
01:44:40.190 --> 01:44:41.090
<v Speaker 2>for like uh,</v>

3618
01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:42.410
<v Speaker 2>for cattle and stuff,</v>

3619
01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:43.430
<v Speaker 2>you can't even eat that shit.</v>

3620
01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:44.140
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

3621
01:44:44.140 --> 01:44:47.110
<v Speaker 2>It's like the stuff they grow for feed for animals,</v>

3622
01:44:47.140 --> 01:44:47.720
<v Speaker 2>like the growth,</v>

3623
01:44:47.720 --> 01:44:47.871
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3624
01:44:47.871 --> 01:44:50.570
<v Speaker 2>high in protein and resistant to pesticides and all that stuff.</v>

3625
01:44:50.850 --> 01:44:51.920
<v Speaker 2>They in that show,</v>

3626
01:44:52.100 --> 01:44:53.570
<v Speaker 2>the documentary king corn,</v>

3627
01:44:54.110 --> 01:44:54.921
<v Speaker 2>they tried eating it.</v>

3628
01:44:54.921 --> 01:44:55.071
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3629
01:44:55.071 --> 01:44:58.730
<v Speaker 2>they grew at an acre of corn and they went through the whole process and through</v>

3630
01:44:58.731 --> 01:45:00.830
<v Speaker 2>the documentary and then they try to eat their core and they're like,</v>

3631
01:45:00.831 --> 01:45:01.491
<v Speaker 2>well fuck,</v>

3632
01:45:01.491 --> 01:45:02.324
<v Speaker 2>are we growing?</v>

3633
01:45:02.420 --> 01:45:03.110
<v Speaker 2>Isn't that horrible?</v>

3634
01:45:03.110 --> 01:45:04.340
<v Speaker 2>Gusting it's crazy.</v>

3635
01:45:04.730 --> 01:45:05.331
<v Speaker 2>It's crazy.</v>

3636
01:45:05.331 --> 01:45:08.990
<v Speaker 2>Well that's when you find out how dangerous California's drought is because we</v>

3637
01:45:08.991 --> 01:45:12.770
<v Speaker 2>always associate the heartland with growing our VI vegetables.</v>

3638
01:45:12.771 --> 01:45:14.030
<v Speaker 2>But that's not really the case.</v>

3639
01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:16.430
<v Speaker 2>The heartland is where we grow all the corn.</v>

3640
01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:18.260
<v Speaker 2>We grow up a lot of different shit.</v>

3641
01:45:18.290 --> 01:45:20.520
<v Speaker 2>Obviously there's a lot of soy,</v>

3642
01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:22.460
<v Speaker 2>all sorts of different things get grown.</v>

3643
01:45:22.580 --> 01:45:26.360
<v Speaker 2>But California is responsible for like a huge percentage of the tomatoes,</v>

3644
01:45:26.590 --> 01:45:28.130
<v Speaker 2>huge percentage of the almonds,</v>

3645
01:45:28.310 --> 01:45:30.020
<v Speaker 2>a huge percentage of the blueberries,</v>

3646
01:45:30.021 --> 01:45:30.801
<v Speaker 2>Avocados,</v>

3647
01:45:30.801 --> 01:45:31.820
<v Speaker 2>strawberries,</v>

3648
01:45:32.300 --> 01:45:33.133
<v Speaker 2>oranges.</v>

3649
01:45:33.290 --> 01:45:37.560
<v Speaker 2>There's a whole lot of shit that gets grown in California and you find out how</v>

3650
01:45:37.590 --> 01:45:39.080
<v Speaker 2>fuck we are with water.</v>

3651
01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:40.640
<v Speaker 2>It's when you realize like,</v>

3652
01:45:40.670 --> 01:45:40.821
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

3653
01:45:40.821 --> 01:45:44.870
<v Speaker 2>this is a food issue for people is not just a food issue for our food.</v>

3654
01:45:45.290 --> 01:45:46.970
<v Speaker 2>It's a food issue front the whole country.</v>

3655
01:45:47.120 --> 01:45:50.210
<v Speaker 2>That's why I want to lead a midnight raid to lake mead tonight.</v>

3656
01:45:50.211 --> 01:45:51.230
<v Speaker 2>If you guys are up for it,</v>

3657
01:45:51.290 --> 01:45:52.520
<v Speaker 2>you gotta steal water from Nevada?</v>

3658
01:45:52.580 --> 01:45:53.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3659
01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:53.840
<v Speaker 2>I got a truck.</v>

3660
01:45:54.140 --> 01:45:54.973
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty big.</v>

3661
01:45:55.100 --> 01:45:57.110
<v Speaker 2>I thought we could get some jugs and whatnot.</v>

3662
01:45:57.140 --> 01:45:57.321
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

3663
01:45:57.321 --> 01:45:59.240
<v Speaker 2>I haven't thought this plan out the whole way.</v>

3664
01:45:59.300 --> 01:46:00.770
<v Speaker 2>How good is this lake mead water?</v>

3665
01:46:00.910 --> 01:46:01.580
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3666
01:46:01.580 --> 01:46:02.600
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty tasty.</v>

3667
01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:03.621
<v Speaker 2>It's gotten,</v>

3668
01:46:03.621 --> 01:46:04.940
<v Speaker 2>it's been run through a damn.</v>

3669
01:46:04.941 --> 01:46:05.481
<v Speaker 2>So there's,</v>

3670
01:46:05.481 --> 01:46:05.990
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3671
01:46:05.990 --> 01:46:07.370
<v Speaker 2>filter with a big Britta.</v>

3672
01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:08.233
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

3673
01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:10.760
<v Speaker 2>I don't think there's any impurities is in,</v>

3674
01:46:11.030 --> 01:46:11.900
<v Speaker 2>put it in a bong,</v>

3675
01:46:11.930 --> 01:46:12.680
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

3676
01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:13.550
<v Speaker 2>Isn't it low?</v>

3677
01:46:13.690 --> 01:46:15.620
<v Speaker 2>Is in lake mead low as well.</v>

3678
01:46:15.621 --> 01:46:17.660
<v Speaker 2>I feel like that was something that was a concern.</v>

3679
01:46:17.690 --> 01:46:18.330
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>

3680
01:46:18.330 --> 01:46:19.510
<v Speaker 2>I would presume reservoirs.</v>

3681
01:46:19.670 --> 01:46:20.301
<v Speaker 2>It's terrible.</v>

3682
01:46:20.301 --> 01:46:21.680
<v Speaker 2>This is the worst one I remember.</v>

3683
01:46:21.890 --> 01:46:23.660
<v Speaker 2>I don't know if you lived in California your whole life,</v>

3684
01:46:23.690 --> 01:46:24.401
<v Speaker 2>are you from company?</v>

3685
01:46:24.401 --> 01:46:25.191
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

3686
01:46:25.191 --> 01:46:27.000
<v Speaker 2>I moved here in 94 where are you from?</v>

3687
01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:29.250
<v Speaker 2>I grew up mostly in Boston,</v>

3688
01:46:29.270 --> 01:46:29.600
<v Speaker 2>Boston,</v>

3689
01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:30.620
<v Speaker 2>born in New Jersey.</v>

3690
01:46:30.621 --> 01:46:33.560
<v Speaker 2>I've lived out here from age seven to 11 though in San Francisco.</v>

3691
01:46:34.010 --> 01:46:34.820
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

3692
01:46:34.820 --> 01:46:39.530
<v Speaker 2>Well we're not in the seven late seventies there was a huge shock and that one</v>

3693
01:46:39.531 --> 01:46:42.200
<v Speaker 2>was the first one that I remember really getting serious.</v>

3694
01:46:42.260 --> 01:46:42.410
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3695
01:46:42.410 --> 01:46:43.130
<v Speaker 2>I was here for that,</v>

3696
01:46:43.130 --> 01:46:43.730
<v Speaker 2>I believe.</v>

3697
01:46:43.730 --> 01:46:45.160
<v Speaker 2>I think that was like 78 or something.</v>

3698
01:46:45.161 --> 01:46:45.410
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

3699
01:46:45.410 --> 01:46:47.060
<v Speaker 2>Lake mead may hit record low.</v>

3700
01:46:47.090 --> 01:46:47.923
<v Speaker 2>Can you believe this?</v>

3701
01:46:47.990 --> 01:46:49.060
<v Speaker 2>So look at the shoreline.</v>

3702
01:46:49.350 --> 01:46:50.310
<v Speaker 2>My God.</v>

3703
01:46:51.060 --> 01:46:51.241
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3704
01:46:51.241 --> 01:46:52.074
<v Speaker 2>the shoreline.</v>

3705
01:46:52.230 --> 01:46:53.760
<v Speaker 2>The marina is going to be dirt.</v>

3706
01:46:54.570 --> 01:46:54.691
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3707

<v Speaker 2>I've seen that.</v>

3709
01:46:58.800 --> 01:46:59.760
<v Speaker 2>That's terrifying.</v>

3710
01:46:59.790 --> 01:47:01.410
<v Speaker 2>Lake Travis is way worse.</v>

3711
01:47:01.590 --> 01:47:03.780
<v Speaker 2>Pull up pictures of Lake Travis in Austin,</v>

3739
01:47:36.450 --> 01:47:38.690
<v Speaker 2>Like your boat is laying out.</v>

3740
01:47:39.030 --> 01:47:41.720
<v Speaker 2>How come no one's ever figured out how to seed clouds?</v>

3741
01:47:41.950 --> 01:47:42.630
<v Speaker 2>Dennis,</v>

<v Speaker 2>I know how to do it.</v>

3743
01:47:43.290 --> 01:47:46.500
<v Speaker 2>You get all that water from the fucking glaciers at the complainant about,</v>

3744
01:47:46.590 --> 01:47:47.423

01:47:48.610 --> 01:47:48.701
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3748
01:47:48.701 --> 01:47:48.791
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3749
01:47:48.791 --> 01:47:48.901
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3750
01:47:48.901 --> 01:47:49.621
<v Speaker 2>You'd get a pipe.</v>

3751
01:47:49.621 --> 01:47:50.460
<v Speaker 2>You put it on the water.</v>

3752
01:47:50.461 --> 01:47:51.300
<v Speaker 2>You take the water back.</v>

3753
01:47:51.301 --> 01:47:52.320
<v Speaker 2>The same that I do with oil.</v>

3754
01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:53.333
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

3755
01:47:53.490 --> 01:47:54.290
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

3756
01:47:54.290 --> 01:47:55.170
<v Speaker 2>not insane.</v>

3757
01:47:55.290 --> 01:47:55.921
<v Speaker 2>These are photos.</v>

3758
01:47:55.921 --> 01:47:57.720
<v Speaker 2>We're looking at photos right now of Lake Travis.</v>

3759
01:47:57.930 --> 01:48:00.510
<v Speaker 2>We could see people's docs like that.</v>

3760
01:48:00.511 --> 01:48:01.520
<v Speaker 2>See those houses up there.</v>

3761
01:48:01.521 --> 01:48:03.720
<v Speaker 2>But those houses were like shoreline houses.</v>

3762
01:48:03.930 --> 01:48:05.160
<v Speaker 2>Like that's the water level.</v>

3763
01:48:05.170 --> 01:48:06.180
<v Speaker 2>There is nothing left.</v>

3764
01:48:06.210 --> 01:48:07.050
<v Speaker 2>Nothing left.</v>

3765
01:48:07.140 --> 01:48:08.490
<v Speaker 2>So these houses,</v>

3766
01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:13.530
<v Speaker 2>like they had this big back yard and the backyard looked over this dock and they</v>

3767
01:48:13.531 --> 01:48:17.820
<v Speaker 2>would go out to their boat and just fucking jet set lifestyle.</v>

3768
01:48:18.060 --> 01:48:18.820
<v Speaker 2>Look at me.</v>

3769
01:48:18.820 --> 01:48:19.651
<v Speaker 2>You live in Austin,</v>

3770
01:48:19.651 --> 01:48:20.161
<v Speaker 2>Texas,</v>

3771
01:48:20.161 --> 01:48:21.720
<v Speaker 2>like I fucking gangster.</v>

3772
01:48:22.170 --> 01:48:23.790
<v Speaker 2>And then it all went away.</v>

3773
01:48:23.820 --> 01:48:25.860
<v Speaker 2>The water like literally all went away.</v>

3774
01:48:25.861 --> 01:48:30.000
<v Speaker 2>It is the craziest thing to look at it from a satellite photo nor from aerial</v>

3775
01:48:30.001 --> 01:48:32.830
<v Speaker 2>photo rather because you realize where um,</v>

3776
01:48:32.860 --> 01:48:33.070
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

3777
01:48:33.070 --> 01:48:34.470
<v Speaker 2>the shore used to be,</v>

3778
01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:35.730
<v Speaker 2>there's some pretty distinct,</v>

3779
01:48:35.910 --> 01:48:36.690
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3780
01:48:36.690 --> 01:48:40.050
<v Speaker 2>versus like that see that it looks like a river that used to all be blue.</v>

3781
01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:44.700
<v Speaker 2>That whole thing was blue and they're letting that motherfucker dry out because</v>

3782
01:48:44.701 --> 01:48:44.911
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

3783
01:48:44.911 --> 01:48:46.140
<v Speaker 2>they pump water in the lake.</v>

3784
01:48:46.140 --> 01:48:48.540
<v Speaker 2>Austin Lake Austin is still full.</v>

3785
01:48:48.660 --> 01:48:51.030
<v Speaker 2>I think they get their water from the Colorado or something.</v>

3786
01:48:51.450 --> 01:48:52.283
<v Speaker 2>The Missouri maybe.</v>

3787
01:48:52.770 --> 01:48:53.580
<v Speaker 2>What do I know?</v>

3788
01:48:53.580 --> 01:48:53.881
<v Speaker 2>What am I?</v>

3789
01:48:53.881 --> 01:48:54.714
<v Speaker 2>Lake expert.</v>

3790
01:48:54.900 --> 01:48:57.630
<v Speaker 2>But the point is they get their water and they,</v>

3791
01:48:57.631 --> 01:49:01.680
<v Speaker 2>they still make sure that Lake Austin gets water,</v>

3792
01:49:01.770 --> 01:49:03.420
<v Speaker 2>but they don't do it to Lake Travis.</v>

3793
01:49:03.421 --> 01:49:03.751
<v Speaker 2>And they're like,</v>

3794
01:49:03.751 --> 01:49:04.584
<v Speaker 2>fuck it,</v>

3795

3823
01:49:44.341 --> 01:49:45.510
<v Speaker 2>He might be one of those art bell.</v>

3831
01:49:57.821 --> 01:49:58.654
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>

3832
01:49:58.660 --> 01:50:00.470
<v Speaker 2>Or we're not rented a zoo.</v>

3833
01:50:00.730 --> 01:50:03.640
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what this Ilo or whatever the fuck goes to real estate site.</v>

3834
01:50:04.030 --> 01:50:04.863
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

3835
01:50:05.260 --> 01:50:06.940
<v Speaker 2>one of those electrical towers,</v>

3836
01:50:06.941 --> 01:50:08.980
<v Speaker 2>like right in front of it on the street.</v>

3837
01:50:09.070 --> 01:50:09.730
<v Speaker 2>Fuck that.</v>

3838
01:50:09.730 --> 01:50:10.563
<v Speaker 2>And you're like,</v>

3839
01:50:10.660 --> 01:50:14.870
<v Speaker 2>that's a little close for me to look at every day to be under Donald B.</v>

3840
01:50:14.870 --> 01:50:14.871
<v Speaker 2>Dot.</v>

3841
01:50:14.871 --> 01:50:15.880
<v Speaker 2>I don't think that's healthy.</v>

3842
01:50:15.980 --> 01:50:16.813
<v Speaker 2>I can't be,</v>

3843
01:50:17.260 --> 01:50:18.460
<v Speaker 2>I think there's like actually,</v>

3844
01:50:18.850 --> 01:50:19.571
<v Speaker 2>although my hair,</v>

3845
01:50:19.571 --> 01:50:19.990
<v Speaker 2>oh shit.</v>

3846
01:50:19.990 --> 01:50:21.400
<v Speaker 2>Then I'd have she here all the time.</v>

3847
01:50:21.430 --> 01:50:21.631
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3848
01:50:21.631 --> 01:50:22.091
<v Speaker 2>It would just be,</v>

3849
01:50:22.091 --> 01:50:22.924
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

3850
01:50:23.100 --> 01:50:24.550
<v Speaker 2>I'd be a young Einstein with them.</v>

3851
01:50:24.820 --> 01:50:27.310
<v Speaker 2>I had to try to watch TV and you hear the sound of that thing.</v>

3852
01:50:30.510 --> 01:50:31.420
<v Speaker 2>It's a weird sound.</v>

3853
01:50:31.421 --> 01:50:31.810
<v Speaker 2>Those things.</v>

3854
01:50:31.810 --> 01:50:35.860
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever walked by like a real big one of those real big towers?</v>

3855
01:50:35.861 --> 01:50:38.370
<v Speaker 2>Like you can actually kind of hear the electricity when you get close.</v>

3856
01:50:38.371 --> 01:50:38.900
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3857
01:50:38.900 --> 01:50:40.720
<v Speaker 2>That freaks me the fuck out man.</v>

3858
01:50:40.810 --> 01:50:44.260
<v Speaker 2>Especially people that live underneath those because there's a couple in Burbank</v>

3859
01:50:44.261 --> 01:50:45.670
<v Speaker 2>where it's like that you were a,</v>

3860
01:50:45.671 --> 01:50:49.810
<v Speaker 2>you park your car on that street and you just hear that home and the sizzle and</v>

3861
01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:51.550
<v Speaker 2>you live right underneath that.</v>

3862
01:50:51.610 --> 01:50:52.440
<v Speaker 2>I can't be grid.</v>

3863
01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:54.850
<v Speaker 2>He look out your window and you see your lights like just glow,</v>

3864
01:50:54.851 --> 01:50:55.684
<v Speaker 2>a little</v>

3865
01:50:58.310 --> 01:50:58.971
<v Speaker 2>brake lights,</v>

3866
01:50:58.971 --> 01:51:01.060
<v Speaker 2>just a little glow and dimmed out little glow.</v>

3867
01:51:01.180 --> 01:51:01.600
<v Speaker 2>We,</v>

3868
01:51:01.600 --> 01:51:05.110
<v Speaker 2>we better get those trees for every one of our outlets so we don't have the</v>

3869
01:51:05.111 --> 01:51:06.280
<v Speaker 2>surge man.</v>

3870
01:51:06.610 --> 01:51:06.791
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3871
01:51:06.791 --> 01:51:11.440
<v Speaker 2>what's crazy is the Tesla a long fucking time ago when he was in that battle</v>

3872
01:51:11.441 --> 01:51:12.280
<v Speaker 2>with Westinghouse,</v>

3873
01:51:12.730 --> 01:51:16.180
<v Speaker 2>Tesla wanted to make electricity available to everyone.</v>

3874
01:51:16.180 --> 01:51:17.320
<v Speaker 2>Like radio.</v>

3875
01:51:17.340 --> 01:51:17.950
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3876
01:51:17.950 --> 01:51:22.000
<v Speaker 2>Somehow or another you'd be pulling your electricity out of the air and he</v>

3877
01:51:22.001 --> 01:51:26.380
<v Speaker 2>developed some kind of a projection method of electricity.</v>

3878
01:51:26.620 --> 01:51:30.700
<v Speaker 2>So instead of these towers with wires that you could monitor how much</v>

3879
01:51:30.701 --> 01:51:32.950
<v Speaker 2>electricity is going back and forth and that's how they charge you.</v>

3880
01:51:33.340 --> 01:51:34.030
<v Speaker 2>Instead of that,</v>

3881
01:51:34.030 --> 01:51:35.560
<v Speaker 2>he was just going to make everything for free.</v>

3882
01:51:35.830 --> 01:51:36.461
<v Speaker 2>Just little dots.</v>

3883
01:51:36.461 --> 01:51:38.560
<v Speaker 2>Why he was shut down so hard of course.</v>

3884
01:51:38.561 --> 01:51:39.251
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

3885
01:51:39.251 --> 01:51:41.410
<v Speaker 2>that's is a tower of power.</v>

3886
01:51:42.490 --> 01:51:43.840
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what they actually called it,</v>

3887
01:51:43.870 --> 01:51:44.703
<v Speaker 2>but that's what it says.</v>

3888
01:51:45.670 --> 01:51:46.870
<v Speaker 2>That's not really what it's called.</v>

3889
01:51:47.230 --> 01:51:47.711
<v Speaker 2>But look at that.</v>

3890
01:51:47.711 --> 01:51:47.981
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3891
01:51:47.981 --> 01:51:50.110
<v Speaker 2>Warden Clive Tower.</v>

3892
01:51:50.460 --> 01:51:51.293
<v Speaker 2>That's what it was.</v>

3893
01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:52.960
<v Speaker 2>That was his idea.</v>

3894
01:51:52.961 --> 01:51:53.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean what?</v>

3895
01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:54.460
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3896
01:51:54.460 --> 01:51:56.050
<v Speaker 2>How weird is that?</v>

3897
01:51:56.051 --> 01:51:56.884
<v Speaker 2>Good for you though.</v>

3898
01:51:57.460 --> 01:52:01.900
<v Speaker 2>That they know about the cell phone towers to go everywhere that it looked like</v>

3899
01:52:01.901 --> 01:52:02.820
<v Speaker 2>palm trees and shit.</v>

3900
01:52:02.870 --> 01:52:03.940
<v Speaker 2>Those aren't good for you either.</v>

3901
01:52:03.940 --> 01:52:04.600
<v Speaker 2>Can't be.</v>

3902
01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:07.210
<v Speaker 2>Well I think those are not that bad though because I think those are just</v>

3903
01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:08.073
<v Speaker 2>receivers.</v>

3904
01:52:08.940 --> 01:52:09.190
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3905
01:52:09.190 --> 01:52:10.090
<v Speaker 2>there must not be received.</v>

3906
01:52:10.091 --> 01:52:13.150
<v Speaker 2>What about all the phones we used in the 90s that were this big and when you</v>

3907
01:52:13.151 --> 01:52:14.170
<v Speaker 2>held them up for half an hour,</v>

3908
01:52:14.171 --> 01:52:15.280
<v Speaker 2>your teeth started to ache.</v>

3909
01:52:16.450 --> 01:52:17.920
<v Speaker 2>Surely that was one good for us.</v>

3910
01:52:18.130 --> 01:52:18.311
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3911
01:52:18.311 --> 01:52:20.260
<v Speaker 2>he wasn't a biology major.</v>

3912
01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:21.041
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>

3913
01:52:21.041 --> 01:52:23.680
<v Speaker 2>Tesla was a guy who was interested in electrics,</v>

3914
01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:27.250
<v Speaker 2>electronics and thinking things through and figuring out machines.</v>

3915
01:52:27.251 --> 01:52:29.920
<v Speaker 2>But biologically he was pretty fucked up.</v>

3916
01:52:30.130 --> 01:52:31.330
<v Speaker 2>He was in love with a pigeon.</v>

3917
01:52:31.390 --> 01:52:32.080
<v Speaker 2>Was He really?</v>

3918
01:52:32.080 --> 01:52:32.321
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

3919
01:52:32.321 --> 01:52:33.660
<v Speaker 2>he said I didn't know anything about his personal,</v>

3920
01:52:33.700 --> 01:52:34.310
<v Speaker 2>other pigeon.</v>

3921
01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:35.143
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3922
01:52:35.380 --> 01:52:36.700
<v Speaker 2>He like had a love affair.</v>

3923
01:52:36.750 --> 01:52:39.970
<v Speaker 2>Like he would talk about this pigeon,</v>

3924
01:52:39.971 --> 01:52:43.780
<v Speaker 2>like it was a woman that he loved and he also had some sort of a strange</v>

3925
01:52:43.781 --> 01:52:44.980
<v Speaker 2>relationship with a woman.</v>

3926
01:52:45.290 --> 01:52:45.800
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

3927
01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:47.030
<v Speaker 2>like she prefaced this by saying,</v>

3928
01:52:47.031 --> 01:52:48.170
<v Speaker 2>I got this from documentary.</v>

3929
01:52:48.350 --> 01:52:49.670
<v Speaker 2>It could be totally bullshit,</v>

3930
01:52:49.970 --> 01:52:50.541
<v Speaker 2>but uh,</v>

3931
01:52:50.541 --> 01:52:52.400
<v Speaker 2>and I haven't seen anything about it since,</v>

3932
01:52:52.550 --> 01:52:55.550
<v Speaker 2>but that he wrote something about destroying,</v>

3933
01:52:55.580 --> 01:52:57.260
<v Speaker 2>impose his sexuality.</v>

3934
01:52:57.560 --> 01:53:00.590
<v Speaker 2>Like he had been in some sort of an affair with some woman and it was so</v>

3935
01:53:00.591 --> 01:53:04.220
<v Speaker 2>distracting and crazy that he might've decided to get castrated.</v>

3936
01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:04.910
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

3937
01:53:04.910 --> 01:53:05.630
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3938
01:53:05.630 --> 01:53:06.620
<v Speaker 2>It'd be like a,</v>

3939
01:53:06.621 --> 01:53:09.380
<v Speaker 2>remember that term destroying his sexuality.</v>

3940
01:53:09.381 --> 01:53:10.460
<v Speaker 2>I don't remember what the fuck the,</v>

3941
01:53:11.570 --> 01:53:13.610
<v Speaker 2>now I'm going to have to read them out to me too.</v>

3942
01:53:13.670 --> 01:53:14.400
<v Speaker 2>God Damn it.</v>

3943
01:53:14.400 --> 01:53:14.610
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3944
01:53:14.610 --> 01:53:14.800
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

3945
01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:16.150
<v Speaker 2>Tesla and then,</v>

3946
01:53:16.220 --> 01:53:16.970
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3947
01:53:16.970 --> 01:53:20.930
<v Speaker 2>Edison fought tooth and nail and medicine beat his ass.</v>

3948
01:53:20.931 --> 01:53:21.500
<v Speaker 2>Basic girl.</v>

3949
01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:22.880
<v Speaker 2>I Westinghouse's she's saying.</v>

3950
01:53:23.020 --> 01:53:23.360
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3951
01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:26.060
<v Speaker 2>Well he also benefited greatly from knowing Tesla.</v>

3952
01:53:26.090 --> 01:53:26.923
<v Speaker 2>Didn't he want,</v>

3953
01:53:26.930 --> 01:53:27.680
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

3954
01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:28.580
<v Speaker 2>alternating current?</v>

3955
01:53:28.581 --> 01:53:28.691
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

3956
01:53:28.691 --> 01:53:29.960
<v Speaker 2>he's the reason why we have all,</v>

3957
01:53:29.961 --> 01:53:30.800
<v Speaker 2>if you wanted direct,</v>

3958
01:53:30.801 --> 01:53:35.210
<v Speaker 2>current Tesla wanted alternate and Edison had the bright idea that direct</v>

3959
01:53:35.211 --> 01:53:35.421
<v Speaker 2>current,</v>

3960
01:53:35.421 --> 01:53:36.230
<v Speaker 2>what's going to be better?</v>

3961
01:53:36.230 --> 01:53:36.351
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

3962
01:53:36.351 --> 01:53:38.600
<v Speaker 2>you remember he used that fucking elephant.</v>

3963
01:53:38.601 --> 01:53:40.820
<v Speaker 2>They electrocuted an elephant to prove a point.</v>

3964
01:53:40.990 --> 01:53:42.650
<v Speaker 2>Like Edison was such a Douche bag.</v>

3965
01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:44.960
<v Speaker 2>He killed an elephant on film.</v>

3966
01:53:44.990 --> 01:53:45.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3967
01:53:45.470 --> 01:53:46.970
<v Speaker 2>Just so that everybody would think that uh,</v>

3968
01:53:47.070 --> 01:53:48.620
<v Speaker 2>alternating current was dangerous.</v>

3969
01:53:49.430 --> 01:53:52.220
<v Speaker 2>How about just don't electrocute anybody with anything direct.</v>

3970
01:53:52.221 --> 01:53:52.701
<v Speaker 2>Current,</v>

3971
01:53:52.701 --> 01:53:53.840
<v Speaker 2>alternating current.</v>

3972
01:53:54.110 --> 01:53:55.900
<v Speaker 2>They'd cook the shit out of that elephant.</v>

3973
01:53:56.580 --> 01:53:59.210
<v Speaker 2>They did it in like a big public plates too,</v>

3974
01:53:59.420 --> 01:54:00.950
<v Speaker 2>which is not that long ago.</v>

3975
01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:01.491
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>

3976
01:54:01.491 --> 01:54:01.731
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

3977
01:54:01.731 --> 01:54:02.001
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

3978
01:54:02.001 --> 01:54:02.721
<v Speaker 2>Think about that.</v>

3979
01:54:02.721 --> 01:54:03.650
<v Speaker 2>These days cook,</v>

3980
01:54:03.710 --> 01:54:08.510
<v Speaker 2>they cooked an elephant on TV in front of everybody to for no reason other than</v>

3981
01:54:08.511 --> 01:54:13.511
<v Speaker 2>to show that their competitors method of delivering electricity was inferior.</v>

3982
01:54:14.360 --> 01:54:15.230
<v Speaker 2>Is this the video?</v>

3983
01:54:15.820 --> 01:54:16.071
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

3984
01:54:16.071 --> 01:54:17.240
<v Speaker 2>this is fucked up to watch,</v>

3985
01:54:17.241 --> 01:54:17.900
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3986
01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:19.340
<v Speaker 2>I have a thing about elephants,</v>

3987
01:54:19.341 --> 01:54:20.150
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

3988
01:54:20.150 --> 01:54:20.960
<v Speaker 2>Elephants are,</v>

3989
01:54:20.960 --> 01:54:22.490
<v Speaker 2>they seem to be really smart.</v>

3990
01:54:22.790 --> 01:54:23.331
<v Speaker 2>Topsy.</v>

3991
01:54:23.331 --> 01:54:23.691
<v Speaker 2>They are.</v>

3992
01:54:23.691 --> 01:54:24.560
<v Speaker 2>They're really sensitive.</v>

3993
01:54:24.890 --> 01:54:25.250
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

3994
01:54:25.250 --> 01:54:28.880
<v Speaker 2>They seem to be really smart and they do have memories and they trust us.</v>

3995
01:54:29.330 --> 01:54:29.751
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

3996
01:54:29.751 --> 01:54:30.021
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

3997
01:54:30.021 --> 01:54:31.970
<v Speaker 2>you take this elephant and you lead it.</v>

3998
01:54:33.580 --> 01:54:33.700
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

3999
01:54:33.700 --> 01:54:34.533
<v Speaker 2>it's just awful.</v>

4000
01:54:34.630 --> 01:54:34.841
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4001
01:54:34.841 --> 01:54:37.930
<v Speaker 2>it's one thing if you've got an elephant that's storming through villages and</v>

4002
01:54:37.931 --> 01:54:39.910
<v Speaker 2>stomping the shit out of people and killing them,</v>

4003
01:54:40.180 --> 01:54:41.110
<v Speaker 2>but then you've got to wonder,</v>

4004
01:54:41.111 --> 01:54:41.261
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

4005
01:54:41.261 --> 01:54:42.550
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck makes that elephant?</v>

4006
01:54:42.551 --> 01:54:43.031
<v Speaker 2>So Matt,</v>

4007
01:54:43.031 --> 01:54:46.180
<v Speaker 2>so here they hit it with the electricity is so fucked up,</v>

4008
01:54:46.181 --> 01:54:46.391
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4009
01:54:46.391 --> 01:54:47.920
<v Speaker 2>They cook the shit out of this elephant.</v>

4010
01:54:48.610 --> 01:54:51.190
<v Speaker 2>It's standing there and they're just pumping it through them.</v>

4011
01:54:52.900 --> 01:54:54.250
<v Speaker 2>He wants to get free too.</v>

4012
01:54:55.590 --> 01:54:56.400
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

4013
01:54:56.400 --> 01:54:57.350
<v Speaker 2>it's really hardcore.</v>

4014
01:54:57.360 --> 01:54:57.601
<v Speaker 2>When you,</v>

4015
01:54:57.601 --> 01:54:58.530
<v Speaker 2>when you see it come on,</v>

4016
01:54:58.531 --> 01:54:58.651
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>

4017
01:54:58.651 --> 01:54:59.371
<v Speaker 2>here it is right there.</v>

4018
01:54:59.371 --> 01:55:00.204
<v Speaker 2>Bam.</v>

4019
01:55:00.210 --> 01:55:01.620
<v Speaker 2>You could see that he starts smoking.</v>

4020
01:55:01.770 --> 01:55:02.603
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

4021
01:55:02.820 --> 01:55:03.240
<v Speaker 2>Terrible.</v>

4022
01:55:03.240 --> 01:55:04.410
<v Speaker 2>It's so fucked up.</v>

4023
01:55:04.980 --> 01:55:07.410
<v Speaker 2>And he just falls over completely dead and stiff.</v>

4024
01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:08.273
<v Speaker 2>It's so nuts.</v>

4025
01:55:10.140 --> 01:55:11.910
<v Speaker 2>But that was such a new thing.</v>

4026
01:55:11.911 --> 01:55:13.150
<v Speaker 2>6,006 years,</v>

4027
01:55:13.151 --> 01:55:14.040
<v Speaker 2>not volts.</v>

4028
01:55:15.220 --> 01:55:16.340
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>

4029
01:55:17.970 --> 01:55:19.650
<v Speaker 2>does it say no,</v>

4030
01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:21.130
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4031
01:55:21.130 --> 01:55:21.300
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

4032
01:55:21.300 --> 01:55:21.900
<v Speaker 2>Three,</v>

4033
01:55:21.900 --> 01:55:22.520
<v Speaker 2>three.</v>

4034
01:55:22.520 --> 01:55:22.880
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

4035
01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:23.640
<v Speaker 2>1903,</v>

4036
01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:24.473
<v Speaker 2>12 years.</v>

4037
01:55:25.150 --> 01:55:25.870
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

4038
01:55:25.870 --> 01:55:26.010
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4039
01:55:26.010 --> 01:55:26.671
<v Speaker 2>not that long.</v>

4040
01:55:26.671 --> 01:55:28.290
<v Speaker 2>Door over years is nothing.</v>

4041
01:55:28.380 --> 01:55:29.220
<v Speaker 2>That's nothing.</v>

4042
01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:31.690
<v Speaker 2>I wonder what they did with the alpha.</v>

4043
01:55:31.691 --> 01:55:31.931
<v Speaker 2>I don't want,</v>

4044
01:55:31.931 --> 01:55:33.180
<v Speaker 2>if they ate it and cooked it,</v>

4045
01:55:33.240 --> 01:55:34.073
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

4046
01:55:35.350 --> 01:55:35.570
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

4047
01:55:35.570 --> 01:55:36.403
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4048
01:55:37.010 --> 01:55:38.060
<v Speaker 2>it's that Coney island,</v>

4049
01:55:38.061 --> 01:55:40.650
<v Speaker 2>they'd probably just slice it open and had burgers and the,</v>

4050
01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:41.750
<v Speaker 2>I don't think they did anything with it.</v>

4051
01:55:41.751 --> 01:55:42.860
<v Speaker 2>I bet they buried it somewhere.</v>

4052
01:55:42.861 --> 01:55:43.050
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

4053
01:55:43.050 --> 01:55:44.760
<v Speaker 2>But they wouldn't even think about eating an elephant,</v>

4054
01:55:45.150 --> 01:55:46.200
<v Speaker 2>which is kind of fucked up.</v>

4055
01:55:47.120 --> 01:55:50.460
<v Speaker 2>This is the only saving grace to those people that hunt those elephants and</v>

4056
01:55:50.461 --> 01:55:51.470
<v Speaker 2>other countries is the,</v>

4057
01:55:51.471 --> 01:55:51.810
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>

4058
01:55:51.810 --> 01:55:52.980
<v Speaker 2>the villagers who are,</v>

4059
01:55:52.981 --> 01:55:54.630
<v Speaker 2>most of them have no meat at all.</v>

4060
01:55:55.020 --> 01:55:56.670
<v Speaker 2>They get to eat that elephant meat.</v>

4061
01:55:57.780 --> 01:55:58.613
<v Speaker 2>That's it.</v>

4062
01:55:58.890 --> 01:55:59.371
<v Speaker 2>Other than that,</v>

4063
01:55:59.371 --> 01:55:59.470
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

4064
01:55:59.470 --> 01:55:59.820
<v Speaker 2>Caroline,</v>

4065
01:55:59.820 --> 01:56:02.670
<v Speaker 2>elephant and elephant seem to be,</v>

4066
01:56:02.700 --> 01:56:04.560
<v Speaker 2>they don't just seem to be smart.</v>

4067
01:56:04.590 --> 01:56:07.420
<v Speaker 2>They seem to be like these like intense social creatures.</v>

4068
01:56:07.860 --> 01:56:08.693
<v Speaker 2>They pair up,</v>

4069
01:56:08.820 --> 01:56:09.110
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

4070
01:56:09.110 --> 01:56:10.710
<v Speaker 2>they recognize each other after,</v>

4071
01:56:10.711 --> 01:56:12.210
<v Speaker 2>I hadn't seen each other in decades.</v>

4072
01:56:13.140 --> 01:56:14.580
<v Speaker 2>This is crazy video of this.</v>

4073
01:56:14.850 --> 01:56:18.330
<v Speaker 2>I think it's a mother and a son or something like that and they hadn't seen each</v>

4074
01:56:18.331 --> 01:56:22.080
<v Speaker 2>other in forever and the two elephants each other and they run to each other and</v>

4075
01:56:22.081 --> 01:56:22.351
<v Speaker 2>they like,</v>

4076
01:56:22.351 --> 01:56:25.920
<v Speaker 2>they hadn't seen each other in decades and they immediately recognized each</v>

4077
01:56:25.921 --> 01:56:26.370
<v Speaker 2>other.</v>

4078
01:56:26.370 --> 01:56:30.060
<v Speaker 2>They have six extraordinary memories and they can smell water.</v>

4079
01:56:30.710 --> 01:56:31.440
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

4080
01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:32.480
<v Speaker 2>That's why when they're,</v>

4081
01:56:32.570 --> 01:56:35.820
<v Speaker 2>when they roam far and wide during the drought season or whatever,</v>

4082
01:56:35.821 --> 01:56:38.220
<v Speaker 2>they can smell it and they can dig underneath and went,</v>

4083
01:56:38.221 --> 01:56:39.240
<v Speaker 2>Whoa,</v>

4084
01:56:39.270 --> 01:56:40.470
<v Speaker 2>that's insane.</v>

4085
01:56:40.710 --> 01:56:41.730
<v Speaker 2>They're highly,</v>

4086
01:56:42.230 --> 01:56:43.080
<v Speaker 2>and what are those?</v>

4087
01:56:43.081 --> 01:56:43.500
<v Speaker 2>Those,</v>

4088
01:56:43.500 --> 01:56:44.201
<v Speaker 2>those horn,</v>

4089
01:56:44.201 --> 01:56:45.510
<v Speaker 2>the tusks are for fighting.</v>

4090
01:56:45.570 --> 01:56:45.901
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4091
01:56:45.901 --> 01:56:50.901
<v Speaker 2>They crash into each other and Duke it out with those tusks to keep them for</v>

4092
01:56:51.421 --> 01:56:51.751
<v Speaker 2>life,</v>

4093
01:56:51.751 --> 01:56:52.890
<v Speaker 2>which is unusual too.</v>

4094
01:56:53.070 --> 01:56:54.330
<v Speaker 2>And they don't ever lose them.</v>

4095
01:56:54.331 --> 01:56:55.500
<v Speaker 2>They don't share that shed them.</v>

4096
01:56:55.900 --> 01:56:56.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4097
01:56:56.700 --> 01:57:01.140
<v Speaker 2>Which would save a lot of fucking death because then the elephants shed their</v>

4098
01:57:01.141 --> 01:57:01.440
<v Speaker 2>test.</v>

4099
01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:02.970
<v Speaker 2>If they did show him all the time,</v>

4100
01:57:02.971 --> 01:57:05.910
<v Speaker 2>people would want them every year they would want to keep my life cause an</v>

4101
01:57:05.911 --> 01:57:07.860
<v Speaker 2>elephant alive would be worth way more.</v>

4102
01:57:08.100 --> 01:57:10.020
<v Speaker 2>And you just get the sheds.</v>

4103
01:57:10.170 --> 01:57:11.520
<v Speaker 2>You don't have to saw it off.</v>

4104
01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:12.900
<v Speaker 2>Just let them fall off.</v>

4105
01:57:13.200 --> 01:57:14.460
<v Speaker 2>And you could have like,</v>

4106
01:57:14.760 --> 01:57:16.620
<v Speaker 2>like when they have deer sheds,</v>

4107
01:57:16.800 --> 01:57:19.050
<v Speaker 2>like if you go to a forest,</v>

4108
01:57:19.110 --> 01:57:19.411
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4109
01:57:19.411 --> 01:57:19.951
<v Speaker 2>anytime,</v>

4110
01:57:19.951 --> 01:57:22.670
<v Speaker 2>like near the spring when dear start losing their,</v>

4111
01:57:22.671 --> 01:57:23.504
<v Speaker 2>their antlers,</v>

4112
01:57:23.520 --> 01:57:24.810
<v Speaker 2>you just find them and pick them up.</v>

4113
01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:25.170
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4114
01:57:25.170 --> 01:57:26.003
<v Speaker 2>Nobody got hurt.</v>

4115
01:57:26.100 --> 01:57:27.810
<v Speaker 2>And you can take them and people use them.</v>

4116
01:57:27.811 --> 01:57:28.770
<v Speaker 2>They make jewelry with them.</v>

4117
01:57:28.771 --> 01:57:30.450
<v Speaker 2>And Shit and they do all kinds of different things with them,</v>

4118
01:57:30.630 --> 01:57:35.190
<v Speaker 2>but it's this hard bony fucking factory that grows in a year.</v>

4119
01:57:35.250 --> 01:57:39.450
<v Speaker 2>So if you see like a Mousse and they have this enormous fucking paddle,</v>

4120
01:57:39.570 --> 01:57:40.950
<v Speaker 2>these paddles in the side of their head,</v>

4121
01:57:41.420 --> 01:57:42.253
<v Speaker 2>I mean their shoe,</v>

4122
01:57:42.780 --> 01:57:43.950
<v Speaker 2>they grew that,</v>

4123
01:57:43.980 --> 01:57:46.650
<v Speaker 2>this fee here and they're going to grow a new one next year,</v>

4124
01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:47.371
<v Speaker 2>every year,</v>

4125
01:57:47.371 --> 01:57:48.300
<v Speaker 2>and they go in that bag.</v>

4126
01:57:48.330 --> 01:57:48.780
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

4127
01:57:48.780 --> 01:57:49.380
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

4128
01:57:49.380 --> 01:57:50.213
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4129
01:57:51.630 --> 01:57:53.190
<v Speaker 2>like the size of a door.</v>

4130
01:57:53.280 --> 01:57:53.940
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

4131
01:57:53.940 --> 01:57:56.100
<v Speaker 2>That door to this room is not purpose.</v>

4132
01:57:57.010 --> 01:57:57.240
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4133
01:57:57.240 --> 01:57:57.630
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

4134
01:57:57.630 --> 01:57:57.930
<v Speaker 2>they're,</v>

4135
01:57:57.930 --> 01:57:58.470
<v Speaker 2>they're not.</v>

4136
01:57:58.470 --> 01:58:03.240
<v Speaker 2>They're huge animals and they grow that entire thing over the course of like a</v>

4137
01:58:03.241 --> 01:58:04.110
<v Speaker 2>month or so.</v>

4138
01:58:04.650 --> 01:58:07.500
<v Speaker 2>It just grows out of their fucking head and it didn't.</v>

4139
01:58:07.501 --> 01:58:09.820
<v Speaker 2>Next year it'll be bigger and next year it'll be big.</v>

4140
01:58:09.990 --> 01:58:10.970
<v Speaker 2>Like this Moose right here,</v>

4141
01:58:11.310 --> 01:58:12.001
<v Speaker 2>this is a moose.</v>

4142
01:58:12.001 --> 01:58:13.560
<v Speaker 2>It is a small antlers.</v>

4143
01:58:13.680 --> 01:58:14.880
<v Speaker 2>This is like a young Moose.</v>

4144
01:58:14.881 --> 01:58:18.660
<v Speaker 2>It's only like a few years old and when they get like six and seven,</v>

4145
01:58:18.810 --> 01:58:22.650
<v Speaker 2>then I have these bigger and bigger and bigger because as they get older and</v>

4146
01:58:22.651 --> 01:58:26.550
<v Speaker 2>they get larger and more dominant because they continued to eat,</v>

4147
01:58:26.551 --> 01:58:30.290
<v Speaker 2>their horns actually get their antlers actually get bigger so they can shell</v>

4148
01:58:30.291 --> 01:58:30.840
<v Speaker 2>pitch.</v>

4149
01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:31.673
<v Speaker 2>I been over there</v>

4150
01:58:33.170 --> 01:58:35.040
<v Speaker 2>fucking tired and they come at,</v>

4151
01:58:35.070 --> 01:58:35.540
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4152
01:58:35.540 --> 01:58:38.920
<v Speaker 2>this huge like that's the thing that scares off the other males like okay this</v>

4153
01:58:38.921 --> 01:58:39.210
<v Speaker 2>is mother.</v>

4154
01:58:39.210 --> 01:58:39.430
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4155
01:58:39.430 --> 01:58:40.263
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4156
01:58:40.800 --> 01:58:41.633
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

4157
01:58:41.670 --> 01:58:42.530
<v Speaker 2>And that bizarre.</v>

4158
01:58:42.730 --> 01:58:43.210
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4159
01:58:43.210 --> 01:58:43.930
<v Speaker 2>that's fantastic.</v>

4160
01:58:43.930 --> 01:58:45.610
<v Speaker 2>Elephants were like that man.</v>

4161
01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:49.630
<v Speaker 2>There'll be so valuable endangered if Moose,</v>

4162
01:58:49.840 --> 01:58:51.730
<v Speaker 2>if Moose antlers were valuable,</v>

4163
01:58:51.731 --> 01:58:52.990
<v Speaker 2>the way elephant tusks were,</v>

4164
01:58:53.160 --> 01:58:55.540
<v Speaker 2>Moose would probably be mostly wiped off the face of the earth,</v>

4165
01:58:55.870 --> 01:58:59.560
<v Speaker 2>but instead they're valued as like a renewable resource cause it's more valuable</v>

4166
01:58:59.740 --> 01:59:02.830
<v Speaker 2>to keep the Moose alive so that they have more moose as he can eat them,</v>

4167
01:59:03.070 --> 01:59:05.690
<v Speaker 2>then just kill them all and cut off their fucking atlas.</v>

4168
01:59:05.691 --> 01:59:06.520
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4169
01:59:06.520 --> 01:59:08.230
<v Speaker 2>It's sad as shit,</v>

4170
01:59:08.231 --> 01:59:08.471
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>

4171
01:59:08.471 --> 01:59:09.370
<v Speaker 2>that seeing that,</v>

4172
01:59:09.371 --> 01:59:09.970
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4173
01:59:09.970 --> 01:59:11.950
<v Speaker 2>that rhino that just went extinct.</v>

4174
01:59:11.970 --> 01:59:12.803
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4175
01:59:12.820 --> 01:59:14.050
<v Speaker 2>Essentially extinct.</v>

4176
01:59:14.290 --> 01:59:18.580
<v Speaker 2>I mean there's one male left and two females and the male won't breed and now</v>

4177
01:59:18.581 --> 01:59:20.520
<v Speaker 2>the female is to uh,</v>

4178
01:59:20.530 --> 01:59:23.740
<v Speaker 2>apparently she's the one female is um,</v>

4179
01:59:23.770 --> 01:59:26.050
<v Speaker 2>she's too weak to accept him on top of her.</v>

4180
01:59:26.080 --> 01:59:26.440
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4181
01:59:26.440 --> 01:59:27.370
<v Speaker 2>Cause you've got to think,</v>

4182
01:59:27.400 --> 01:59:27.890
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

4183
01:59:27.890 --> 01:59:28.121
<v Speaker 2>mine,</v>

4184
01:59:28.121 --> 01:59:29.140
<v Speaker 2>those are enormous.</v>

4185
01:59:29.141 --> 01:59:32.230
<v Speaker 2>So he's got to get on top of her to fuck her and they're basically saying this</v>

4186
01:59:32.231 --> 01:59:32.590
<v Speaker 2>is it.</v>

4187
01:59:32.590 --> 01:59:33.910
<v Speaker 2>You're looking at the last three.</v>

4188
01:59:33.980 --> 01:59:34.330
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

4189
01:59:34.330 --> 01:59:35.400
<v Speaker 2>These rhinos Ph night.</v>

4190
01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:40.000
<v Speaker 2>And I think his horn is actually cut off so that it's not valuable.</v>

4191
01:59:40.060 --> 01:59:40.480
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

4192
01:59:40.480 --> 01:59:41.810
<v Speaker 2>I think there's an image of that's the other,</v>

4193
01:59:41.820 --> 01:59:43.750
<v Speaker 2>there's an image like the last remaining rhino,</v>

4194
01:59:43.870 --> 01:59:44.650
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

4195
01:59:44.650 --> 01:59:47.710
<v Speaker 2>They cut their horns off to keep people from poaching and key people from</v>

4196
01:59:47.711 --> 01:59:48.400
<v Speaker 2>poaching them.</v>

4197
01:59:48.400 --> 01:59:49.630
<v Speaker 2>Flip China.</v>

4198
01:59:49.631 --> 01:59:51.130
<v Speaker 2>Is it that wants to rhino horns.</v>

4199
01:59:51.430 --> 01:59:51.851
<v Speaker 2>They want it.</v>

4200
01:59:51.851 --> 01:59:53.320
<v Speaker 2>They don't know about Viagara over there.</v>

4201
01:59:53.321 --> 01:59:58.260
<v Speaker 2>They still looking for Tiger Dick and Rhino Horn dude.</v>

4202
01:59:58.350 --> 01:59:59.980
<v Speaker 2>It's called Cialis.</v>

4203
02:00:00.370 --> 02:00:01.180
<v Speaker 2>You go to the store,</v>

4204
02:00:01.180 --> 02:00:02.013
<v Speaker 2>you buy it.</v>

4205
02:00:02.710 --> 02:00:04.090
<v Speaker 2>So what they make it over there.</v>

4206
02:00:04.091 --> 02:00:04.924
<v Speaker 2>It's cheaper.</v>

4207
02:00:05.320 --> 02:00:06.020
<v Speaker 2>Look at them.</v>

4208
02:00:06.020 --> 02:00:06.550
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

4209
02:00:06.550 --> 02:00:07.750
<v Speaker 2>It's horns hacked off.</v>

4210
02:00:07.960 --> 02:00:08.793
<v Speaker 2>That's crazy.</v>

4211
02:00:08.920 --> 02:00:11.950
<v Speaker 2>Both of his horns are hacked off unless they just wore 'em off.</v>

4212
02:00:12.040 --> 02:00:12.873
<v Speaker 2>Is that possible?</v>

4213
02:00:12.910 --> 02:00:13.361
<v Speaker 2>It is,</v>

4214
02:00:13.361 --> 02:00:16.750
<v Speaker 2>but I think they'd probably cut them off because there and he's in a preserve.</v>

4215
02:00:16.870 --> 02:00:17.703
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4216
02:00:18.710 --> 02:00:19.480
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

4217
02:00:19.480 --> 02:00:22.090
<v Speaker 2>the [inaudible] conservancy in Kenya.</v>

4218
02:00:22.690 --> 02:00:24.430
<v Speaker 2>What a crazy animal that thing is though.</v>

4219
02:00:24.431 --> 02:00:27.850
<v Speaker 2>What do you think about all the variation that nature has to offer?</v>

4220
02:00:27.920 --> 02:00:32.000
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] difference between like a ground squirrel and a rhinoceros and a</v>

4221
02:00:32.001 --> 02:00:34.150
<v Speaker 2>rhino look at that thing.</v>

4222
02:00:34.690 --> 02:00:39.550
<v Speaker 2>There's a famous one they brought to Europe in the 14 hundreds and juror data</v>

4223
02:00:39.730 --> 02:00:40.421
<v Speaker 2>matching of it.</v>

4224
02:00:40.421 --> 02:00:43.030
<v Speaker 2>And it's inaccurate because he only heard about it,</v>

4225
02:00:43.330 --> 02:00:46.060
<v Speaker 2>but it was a very famous painting and it was a very famous rhino and they turned</v>

4226
02:00:46.061 --> 02:00:47.710
<v Speaker 2>it all around Europe and then it finally croaked.</v>

4227
02:00:47.890 --> 02:00:50.440
<v Speaker 2>But everybody had to see it cause no one had ever seen one before.</v>

4228
02:00:51.250 --> 02:00:52.083
<v Speaker 2>And uh,</v>

4229
02:00:52.390 --> 02:00:53.500
<v Speaker 2>I can't remember the name of it.</v>

4230
02:00:53.501 --> 02:00:53.771
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>

4231
02:00:53.771 --> 02:00:55.180
<v Speaker 2>You'd have to look up Meti,</v>

4232
02:00:55.181 --> 02:00:56.890
<v Speaker 2>low rhino or yours.</v>

4233
02:00:56.920 --> 02:00:57.370
<v Speaker 2>Rhino.</v>

4234
02:00:57.370 --> 02:00:59.350
<v Speaker 2>They found rhinos in the Congo.</v>

4235
02:00:59.800 --> 02:01:04.800
<v Speaker 2>They found rhinos in the actual jungle and they had only been like a legend</v>

4236
02:01:05.470 --> 02:01:06.160
<v Speaker 2>because they're,</v>

4237
02:01:06.160 --> 02:01:07.390
<v Speaker 2>they're more planes out.</v>

4238
02:01:07.390 --> 02:01:09.430
<v Speaker 2>It's going to say that I thought that they'd done the belt or whatever,</v>

4239
02:01:09.460 --> 02:01:14.460
<v Speaker 2>but what happened was the climate shifted around the Congo so rapidly that</v>

4240
02:01:15.011 --> 02:01:19.900
<v Speaker 2>plane's be camp became tropical rain forest all around them.</v>

4241
02:01:19.901 --> 02:01:20.111
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

4242
02:01:20.111 --> 02:01:20.891
<v Speaker 2>That's his sketch.</v>

4243
02:01:20.891 --> 02:01:21.131
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4244
02:01:21.131 --> 02:01:22.780
<v Speaker 2>That's a drawing by juror.</v>

4245
02:01:22.781 --> 02:01:23.880
<v Speaker 2>What year is that drawing,</v>

4246
02:01:23.881 --> 02:01:24.700
<v Speaker 2>Janey?</v>

4247
02:01:24.700 --> 02:01:25.533
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

4248
02:01:25.780 --> 02:01:26.620
<v Speaker 2>1514.</v>

4249
02:01:26.930 --> 02:01:27.371
<v Speaker 2>And that,</v>

4250
02:01:27.371 --> 02:01:29.170
<v Speaker 2>that elephant he was told about.</v>

4251
02:01:29.470 --> 02:01:30.161
<v Speaker 2>That's incredible.</v>

4252
02:01:30.161 --> 02:01:31.270
<v Speaker 2>And it toured Europe.</v>

4253
02:01:31.300 --> 02:01:32.500
<v Speaker 2>It was a famous elephant.</v>

4254
02:01:32.560 --> 02:01:33.420
<v Speaker 2>I mean rhino.</v>

4255
02:01:33.430 --> 02:01:33.821
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

4256
02:01:33.821 --> 02:01:35.290
<v Speaker 2>So he was only told about that.</v>

4257
02:01:36.320 --> 02:01:38.380
<v Speaker 2>It's not out anatomically accurate.</v>

4258
02:01:38.410 --> 02:01:38.651
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

4259
02:01:38.651 --> 02:01:43.130
<v Speaker 2>he's kind of thrown in like the feed and the way the scales work and everything.</v>

4260
02:01:44.360 --> 02:01:45.980
<v Speaker 2>It's definitely a little different,</v>

4261
02:01:45.981 --> 02:01:46.671
<v Speaker 2>but damn.</v>

4262
02:01:46.671 --> 02:01:47.000
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4263
02:01:47.000 --> 02:01:47.801
<v Speaker 2>Pretty fucking good.</v>

4264
02:01:47.801 --> 02:01:51.140
<v Speaker 2>This was like a sensation and the early 15 hundreds in Europe,</v>

4265
02:01:51.141 --> 02:01:52.730
<v Speaker 2>people were like losing their shit over.</v>

4266
02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:53.451
<v Speaker 2>What's the other one?</v>

4267
02:01:53.451 --> 02:01:55.380
<v Speaker 2>The yellower one up fucked up top Jamie.</v>

4268
02:01:56.180 --> 02:01:56.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4269
02:01:56.420 --> 02:01:57.253
<v Speaker 2>What does that one,</v>

4270
02:01:57.620 --> 02:01:58.880
<v Speaker 2>is that the original version of it?</v>

4271
02:01:59.130 --> 02:01:59.963
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

4272
02:02:00.020 --> 02:02:01.100
<v Speaker 2>I love that shit.</v>

4273
02:02:01.520 --> 02:02:05.060
<v Speaker 2>I love looking at like the original version of a drawing like that.</v>

4274
02:02:05.061 --> 02:02:06.890
<v Speaker 2>The system that see again,</v>

4275
02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:07.720
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about,</v>

4276
02:02:07.720 --> 02:02:08.210
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4277
02:02:08.210 --> 02:02:10.550
<v Speaker 2>his scribbles hit right in his hand.</v>

4278
02:02:10.551 --> 02:02:12.620
<v Speaker 2>Artist's touch his hand,</v>

4279
02:02:12.621 --> 02:02:14.930
<v Speaker 2>write his notes all through the bottom and a look at that.</v>

4280
02:02:14.931 --> 02:02:18.340
<v Speaker 2>His handwriting and people had elegant handwriting back then.</v>

4281
02:02:18.350 --> 02:02:21.440
<v Speaker 2>Look how much writing he's getting in at the bottom of that page.</v>

4282
02:02:22.070 --> 02:02:26.510
<v Speaker 2>And I don't know what I'm assuming is riding in German and the 15 hundreds.</v>

4283
02:02:27.180 --> 02:02:28.190
<v Speaker 2>If it's in Latin,</v>

4284
02:02:28.610 --> 02:02:30.050
<v Speaker 2>I can tell you he writes the name,</v>

4285
02:02:30.051 --> 02:02:32.950
<v Speaker 2>why Nasir Nasir on right.</v>

4286
02:02:32.990 --> 02:02:33.561
<v Speaker 2>That's a lot.</v>

4287
02:02:33.561 --> 02:02:34.550
<v Speaker 2>And it's like a transformer.</v>

4288
02:02:34.580 --> 02:02:35.361
<v Speaker 2>Like there's one of them.</v>

4289
02:02:35.361 --> 02:02:35.820
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

4290
02:02:35.820 --> 02:02:36.440
<v Speaker 2>that sounds good.</v>

4291
02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:38.080
<v Speaker 2>Drugs for riding.</v>

4292
02:02:38.130 --> 02:02:38.963
<v Speaker 2>Nassa Ron.</v>

4293
02:02:40.130 --> 02:02:42.650
<v Speaker 2>Well this area of the Congo where the film,</v>

4294
02:02:42.651 --> 02:02:43.490
<v Speaker 2>these rhinos,</v>

4295
02:02:43.700 --> 02:02:44.330
<v Speaker 2>they had just,</v>

4296
02:02:44.330 --> 02:02:46.730
<v Speaker 2>they'd heard about it from the locals and they were like,</v>

4297
02:02:46.731 --> 02:02:48.160
<v Speaker 2>what the fuck are they're babbling about?</v>

4298
02:02:48.170 --> 02:02:49.270
<v Speaker 2>There's no rhinos,</v>

4299
02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:50.240
<v Speaker 2>don't live in the jungle.</v>

4300
02:02:50.660 --> 02:02:51.291
<v Speaker 2>And then they,</v>

4301
02:02:51.291 --> 02:02:51.411
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

4302
02:02:51.411 --> 02:02:55.340
<v Speaker 2>they finally found him and it took a while before they realized that the climate</v>

4303
02:02:55.341 --> 02:02:56.810
<v Speaker 2>has shifted and this,</v>

4304
02:02:57.020 --> 02:02:58.100
<v Speaker 2>these planes,</v>

4305
02:02:58.280 --> 02:02:58.581
<v Speaker 2>they,</v>

4306
02:02:58.581 --> 02:03:00.650
<v Speaker 2>the plains animals would just stuck.</v>

4307
02:03:00.800 --> 02:03:04.660
<v Speaker 2>Cause like almost immediately this rain forest is,</v>

4308
02:03:04.670 --> 02:03:06.860
<v Speaker 2>grew around them over the course of like,</v>

4309
02:03:06.861 --> 02:03:07.071
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

4310
02:03:07.071 --> 02:03:08.880
<v Speaker 2>a few thousand years or a few hundred years even.</v>

4311
02:03:09.290 --> 02:03:10.101
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it was very long.</v>

4312
02:03:10.101 --> 02:03:13.880
<v Speaker 2>I think it was actually 2000 years and these animals get stuck there and some of</v>

4313
02:03:13.881 --> 02:03:14.810
<v Speaker 2>them adapted.</v>

4314
02:03:15.110 --> 02:03:19.820
<v Speaker 2>One of the really curious had adaptations was this animal called a Diker.</v>

4315
02:03:19.970 --> 02:03:24.970
<v Speaker 2>It's like this little tiny antelope that can now swim underwater up to a hundred</v>

4316
02:03:25.280 --> 02:03:25.520
<v Speaker 2>yards,</v>

4317
02:03:25.520 --> 02:03:26.353
<v Speaker 2>goes underwater.</v>

4318
02:03:26.380 --> 02:03:27.500
<v Speaker 2>Never had to do that before.</v>

4319
02:03:27.501 --> 02:03:28.740
<v Speaker 2>They used to just run around.</v>

4320
02:03:28.750 --> 02:03:29.170
<v Speaker 2>Run.</v>

4321
02:03:29.170 --> 02:03:29.440
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4322
02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:33.530
<v Speaker 2>So now this motherfucker can swim and the animals can adapt over time and they</v>

4323
02:03:33.531 --> 02:03:34.190
<v Speaker 2>eat fish.</v>

4324
02:03:34.190 --> 02:03:34.491
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4325
02:03:34.491 --> 02:03:35.450
<v Speaker 2>And what are the rhinos do?</v>

4326
02:03:35.450 --> 02:03:36.530
<v Speaker 2>Their jungle rhinos.</v>

4327
02:03:36.531 --> 02:03:37.281
<v Speaker 2>They're jungle rhino.</v>

4328
02:03:37.281 --> 02:03:37.851
<v Speaker 2>So those,</v>

4329
02:03:37.851 --> 02:03:40.130
<v Speaker 2>those you're checking it antelope type.</v>

4330
02:03:40.131 --> 02:03:41.090
<v Speaker 2>Animal eats fish.</v>

4331
02:03:41.690 --> 02:03:42.110
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4332
02:03:42.110 --> 02:03:43.340
<v Speaker 2>Well that's learned behavior,</v>

4333
02:03:43.341 --> 02:03:43.810
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4334
02:03:43.810 --> 02:03:44.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4335
02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:44.631
<v Speaker 2>most likely,</v>

4336
02:03:44.631 --> 02:03:45.090
<v Speaker 2>but you know,</v>

4337
02:03:45.090 --> 02:03:48.350
<v Speaker 2>they've been finding out lately is that deer eat birds.</v>

4338
02:03:48.500 --> 02:03:49.070
<v Speaker 2>Do you think they,</v>

4339
02:03:49.070 --> 02:03:49.910
<v Speaker 2>we didn't know about it.</v>

4340
02:03:49.911 --> 02:03:50.271
<v Speaker 2>Look at that.</v>

4341
02:03:50.271 --> 02:03:51.500
<v Speaker 2>That's a Jesus.</v>

4342
02:03:51.560 --> 02:03:52.190
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>

4343
02:03:52.190 --> 02:03:52.641
<v Speaker 2>What's it eating?</v>

4344
02:03:52.641 --> 02:03:53.474
<v Speaker 2>The frog frog.</v>

4345
02:03:53.900 --> 02:03:55.250
<v Speaker 2>There's a Diker or eating a frog.</v>

4346
02:03:55.251 --> 02:03:56.084
<v Speaker 2>A little monster.</v>

4347
02:03:56.390 --> 02:03:56.531
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

4348
02:03:56.531 --> 02:03:57.710
<v Speaker 2>don't you think of a deer?</v>

4349
02:03:57.920 --> 02:04:00.380
<v Speaker 2>You think they're not carnivores?</v>

4350
02:04:00.410 --> 02:04:00.561
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

4351
02:04:00.561 --> 02:04:03.290
<v Speaker 2>you definitely don't think it's going to go eat a frog that day.</v>

4352
02:04:03.310 --> 02:04:04.580
<v Speaker 2>You got to catch a frog.</v>

4353
02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:05.720
<v Speaker 2>You know?</v>

4354
02:04:05.720 --> 02:04:06.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

4355
02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:07.730
<v Speaker 2>frogs don't just let you grab them.</v>

4356
02:04:07.760 --> 02:04:09.590
<v Speaker 2>I know you've got to go after that little fucker.</v>

4357
02:04:09.650 --> 02:04:10.700
<v Speaker 2>So I think there's,</v>

4358
02:04:10.701 --> 02:04:11.360
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>

4359
02:04:11.360 --> 02:04:12.040
<v Speaker 2>these videos,</v>

4360
02:04:12.040 --> 02:04:12.651
<v Speaker 2>we watched some,</v>

4361
02:04:12.651 --> 02:04:17.651
<v Speaker 2>one of the last podcast of a deer eating birds and people didn't know that they</v>

4362
02:04:17.691 --> 02:04:18.300
<v Speaker 2>did that.</v>

4363
02:04:18.300 --> 02:04:18.920
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4364
02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:21.470
<v Speaker 2>you just now told him he didn't know until like this year.</v>

4365
02:04:21.710 --> 02:04:23.540
<v Speaker 2>Like this is like these to think that like,</v>

4366
02:04:23.900 --> 02:04:24.770
<v Speaker 2>you know these,</v>

4367
02:04:24.890 --> 02:04:26.210
<v Speaker 2>these birds that would die,</v>

4368
02:04:26.211 --> 02:04:29.210
<v Speaker 2>the ground nesting birds or birds that fall out of trees,</v>

4369
02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:31.550
<v Speaker 2>that they would get eaten by coyotes and stuff.</v>

4370
02:04:31.551 --> 02:04:33.410
<v Speaker 2>See all those birds coming after the deer.</v>

4371
02:04:33.830 --> 02:04:37.380
<v Speaker 2>It's because the deer is eating a bird and you could see it like really clearly</v>

4372
02:04:37.381 --> 02:04:38.570
<v Speaker 2>as they get close to it.</v>

4373
02:04:38.571 --> 02:04:39.630
<v Speaker 2>The people who were filming this,</v>

4374
02:04:39.631 --> 02:04:41.340
<v Speaker 2>we're trying to figure out what the fuck was going on.</v>

4375
02:04:41.850 --> 02:04:42.990
<v Speaker 2>And then as time went on,</v>

4376
02:04:42.991 --> 02:04:45.900
<v Speaker 2>they realized this deer is following this bird around trying to bite it,</v>

4377
02:04:45.901 --> 02:04:46.560
<v Speaker 2>see it,</v>

4378
02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:47.480
<v Speaker 2>see the Berlin ground.</v>

4379
02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:48.593
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4380
02:04:48.720 --> 02:04:49.690
<v Speaker 2>And so it's,</v>

4381
02:04:49.691 --> 02:04:51.160
<v Speaker 2>it's following it seats,</v>

4382
02:04:51.180 --> 02:04:51.811
<v Speaker 2>chasing it.</v>

4383
02:04:51.811 --> 02:04:53.190
<v Speaker 2>And then finally when it gets it,</v>

4384
02:04:53.460 --> 02:04:57.180
<v Speaker 2>it bites it and starts fucking up this bird and it's chewing it alive.</v>

4385
02:04:57.180 --> 02:04:58.200
<v Speaker 2>And it's crazy to watch,</v>

4386
02:04:58.201 --> 02:04:58.680
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

4387
02:04:58.680 --> 02:05:01.980
<v Speaker 2>I mean is it's not just accidentally stumbling upon this.</v>

4388
02:05:02.360 --> 02:05:05.060
<v Speaker 2>It's going after it cause he keeps stepping,</v>

4389
02:05:05.080 --> 02:05:08.670
<v Speaker 2>keep stepping the finally it gets a hold of the bird and just starts fucking</v>

4390
02:05:08.671 --> 02:05:11.140
<v Speaker 2>that burn up and eating it and apparently look,</v>

4391
02:05:11.150 --> 02:05:11.983
<v Speaker 2>see it.</v>

4392
02:05:12.240 --> 02:05:13.320
<v Speaker 2>Apparently that's what they do.</v>

4393
02:05:13.530 --> 02:05:18.530
<v Speaker 2>They eat birds and we have made them these benign grass eating gentle creatures.</v>

4394
02:05:19.830 --> 02:05:20.161
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

4395
02:05:20.161 --> 02:05:23.270
<v Speaker 2>they eat birds all alive.</v>

4396
02:05:23.670 --> 02:05:26.130
<v Speaker 2>And while the bird is squirming and trying to get away,</v>

4397
02:05:26.160 --> 02:05:27.930
<v Speaker 2>they give zero fucks.</v>

4398
02:05:28.440 --> 02:05:31.710
<v Speaker 2>They have a cold hearted bird eating demeanor.</v>

4399
02:05:31.720 --> 02:05:32.310
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

4400
02:05:32.310 --> 02:05:33.690

02:07:44.630 --> 02:07:45.040
<v Speaker 2>Bobby?</v>

4519
02:07:45.040 --> 02:07:46.180
<v Speaker 2>We should probably don't gas.</v>

4520
02:07:46.210 --> 02:07:48.240
<v Speaker 2>The shirts were made by this.</v>

4521
02:07:48.340 --> 02:07:49.090
<v Speaker 2>These are the,</v>

4522
02:07:49.090 --> 02:07:50.230
<v Speaker 2>these are the astronauts shirts.</v>

4523
02:07:50.231 --> 02:07:51.140
<v Speaker 2>If you guys know what,</v>

4524
02:07:51.141 --> 02:07:51.974
<v Speaker 2>what happened?</v>

4525
02:07:52.210 --> 02:07:52.770
<v Speaker 2>There was a,</v>

4526
02:07:52.770 --> 02:07:57.770
<v Speaker 2>an astronaut that got in trouble for wearing these shirts.</v>

4527
02:07:57.910 --> 02:07:58.940
<v Speaker 2>Hung men of the night one.</v>

4528
02:07:58.950 --> 02:07:59.290
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4529
02:07:59.290 --> 02:08:00.400
<v Speaker 2>We tried to balance it out,</v>

4530
02:08:00.401 --> 02:08:01.780
<v Speaker 2>so she sent us a gay one.</v>

4531
02:08:01.930 --> 02:08:06.010
<v Speaker 2>So a or a female women can wait.</v>

4532
02:08:06.010 --> 02:08:07.480
<v Speaker 2>I guess it would be more female than gay.</v>

4533
02:08:07.481 --> 02:08:07.631
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

4534
02:08:07.631 --> 02:08:08.464
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't have to be getting that.</v>

4535
02:08:08.470 --> 02:08:09.400
<v Speaker 2>If a woman wore that,</v>

4536
02:08:09.401 --> 02:08:11.260
<v Speaker 2>I would be questioning her tastes a little bit.</v>

4537
02:08:12.220 --> 02:08:14.770
<v Speaker 2>What'd you for real while I'm questioning Brian's right now,</v>

4538
02:08:14.771 --> 02:08:16.520
<v Speaker 2>but I understand he's just trying to get in the spirit.</v>

4539
02:08:16.830 --> 02:08:17.950
<v Speaker 2>He's just being silly.</v>

4540
02:08:17.951 --> 02:08:20.810
<v Speaker 2>Goose man trapped in a guy's body.</v>

4541
02:08:21.400 --> 02:08:22.300
<v Speaker 2>Something's chapped.</v>

4542
02:08:22.360 --> 02:08:23.500
<v Speaker 2>The scientists got in trouble.</v>

4543
02:08:23.501 --> 02:08:26.200
<v Speaker 2>It was actually his friend Ellie that made these shirts and she sent him to us,</v>

4544
02:08:26.201 --> 02:08:26.790
