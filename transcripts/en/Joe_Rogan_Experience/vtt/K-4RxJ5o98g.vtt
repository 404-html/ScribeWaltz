6
00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:15.151
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

7
00:00:15.151 --> 00:00:17.760
<v Speaker 1>do you put that in your head or do you just go and try to win?</v>

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.200
<v Speaker 2>I try.</v>

12
00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:27.330
<v Speaker 2>I mean the thing is like for a lot of these guys,</v>

13
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.770
<v Speaker 2>too many witnesses,</v>

14
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.030
<v Speaker 2>too much of a record.</v>

15
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.010
<v Speaker 2>It's coming down to this fucking apology,</v>

16
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:32.520
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

17
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.630
<v Speaker 2>It's coming down to our plan for what we're going to do next and talking with</v>

18
00:00:36.631 --> 00:00:39.900
<v Speaker 2>them and coming up with a reasonable plan about what they're going to do after</v>

19
00:00:39.901 --> 00:00:44.901
<v Speaker 2>jail or what they could do instead of jail and addressing like why would they</v>

20
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.100
<v Speaker 2>they did something wrong.</v>

21
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.521
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

22
00:00:47.521 --> 00:00:48.480
<v Speaker 2>Why was it wrong?</v>

23
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.490
<v Speaker 2>Like I would go through with my clients a lot of the times if I wasn't sure that</v>

24
00:00:53.491 --> 00:00:54.960
<v Speaker 2>they were getting it and I would be like,</v>

25
00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:55.770
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

26
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.600
<v Speaker 2>so you're going to have to give an apology to the judge.</v>

27
00:00:57.601 --> 00:00:59.550
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have to tell them that what you did is wrong.</v>

28
00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:01.950
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have to tell him that you know that it was wrong and you're</v>

29
00:01:01.951 --> 00:01:02.461
<v Speaker 2>gonna have to tell them,</v>

30
00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:03.480
<v Speaker 2>you know why it was wrong.</v>

31
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.350
<v Speaker 2>So why is it wrong to hit your girlfriend?</v>

32
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.293
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

33
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.630
<v Speaker 2>she doesn't want me to.</v>

34
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:13.201
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

35
00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:13.780
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

36
00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.400
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

37
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.233
<v Speaker 2>There's one,</v>

38
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.960
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

39
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.980
<v Speaker 2>when you hit your girlfriend,</v>

40
00:01:16.981 --> 00:01:18.180
<v Speaker 2>what did the police have to do?</v>

41
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.780
<v Speaker 2>They have to show up and they have to arrest me.</v>

42
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.130
<v Speaker 2>Were you nice to them?</v>

43
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.083
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

44
00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.710
<v Speaker 2>Do you think they like that?</v>

45
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:26.813
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

46
00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.510
<v Speaker 2>Do you think now it'd be the time to apologize for being a dick to them when</v>

47
00:01:30.511 --> 00:01:31.860
<v Speaker 2>they were just doing their jobs?</v>

48
00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.833
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

49
00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.470
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

50
00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.060
<v Speaker 2>But now say it in a different way.</v>

51
00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:40.310
<v Speaker 2>Say it in a nice way and then I made them say it in a nice light.</v>

52
00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.090
<v Speaker 2>Then you have to really coach them through this.</v>

53
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.740
<v Speaker 2>And do you,</v>

54
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:43.501
<v Speaker 2>do you let them know,</v>

55
00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:46.950
<v Speaker 2>like listen to your freedom may ride on whether or not you're believable?</v>

56
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.500
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

57
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.220
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

58
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.350
<v Speaker 2>Most important performance.</v>

59
00:01:49.351 --> 00:01:50.250
<v Speaker 2>I would tell them like,</v>

60
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.850
<v Speaker 2>you,</v>

61
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.500
<v Speaker 2>you're not going to lie up there.</v>

62
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.240
<v Speaker 2>Everything you say is going to be true.</v>

63
00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.600
<v Speaker 2>We just need to make you fucking recognize you for just a couple minutes.</v>

64
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.390
<v Speaker 2>You got to recognize this situation because you can't lie out there.</v>

65
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.560
<v Speaker 2>They hear too many lies.</v>

66
00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:05.523
<v Speaker 2>They don't like lies.</v>

67
00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.950
<v Speaker 2>Just it's like George Michael and freedom,</v>

68
00:02:07.951 --> 00:02:09.750
<v Speaker 2>like take a lie and make it true.</v>

69
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.000
<v Speaker 2>A lot of times I would ask quote George Michael,</v>

70
00:02:12.001 --> 00:02:12.181
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

71
00:02:12.181 --> 00:02:13.500
<v Speaker 2>I did that song freedom.</v>

72
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

73
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.580
<v Speaker 2>It's a good song.</v>

74
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.211
<v Speaker 2>It is a good song,</v>

75
00:02:15.211 --> 00:02:15.550
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

76
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.810
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

77
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.910
<v Speaker 2>Good on you for Admin.</v>

78
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.770
<v Speaker 2>A lot of people that shy away from giving George Michael that prompts he</v>

79
00:02:19.771 --> 00:02:20.550
<v Speaker 2>deserves.</v>

80
00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.000
<v Speaker 2>But I would use like take these lies and make them true.</v>

81
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.890
<v Speaker 2>I would use that on my clients.</v>

82
00:02:25.891 --> 00:02:26.724
<v Speaker 2>And he's saying that.</v>

83
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.390
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

84
00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.871
<v Speaker 2>I'm terrible.</v>

85
00:02:27.871 --> 00:02:28.680
<v Speaker 2>So you can say it.</v>

86
00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:29.140
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

87
00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.973
<v Speaker 2>I can't.</v>

88
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:39.803
<v Speaker 1>There we go.</v>

89
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.971
<v Speaker 1>Dude.</v>

90
00:02:40.971 --> 00:02:41.301
<v Speaker 1>How about,</v>

91
00:02:41.301 --> 00:02:44.830
<v Speaker 1>I was in this a goat cart thing with Jason Ellis and Dominick Cruz is there.</v>

92
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.310
<v Speaker 1>If you're competitive,</v>

93
00:02:46.311 --> 00:02:47.450
<v Speaker 1>you raised some fucking goat carts.</v>

94
00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.320
<v Speaker 1>I see Dominic Cruz in the corner hyping himself up dead.</v>

95
00:02:51.321 --> 00:02:52.060
<v Speaker 1>Serious gun.</v>

96
00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.000
<v Speaker 1>They don't want you to win.</v>

97
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.550
<v Speaker 1>They don't want you to win this.</v>

98
00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:56.450
<v Speaker 1>He's talking to himself.</v>

99
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:57.070
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

100
00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.530
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

101
00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.730
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

102
00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:58.080
<v Speaker 1>doesn't love.</v>

103
00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.770
<v Speaker 1>It was crazy playing for keeps.</v>

104
00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.820
<v Speaker 1>When this guy picks him,</v>

105
00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:01.390
<v Speaker 1>he goes,</v>

106
00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:02.380
<v Speaker 1>the guy who works there,</v>

107
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.600
<v Speaker 1>it's like some costco fucking warehouse thing.</v>

108
00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:05.410
<v Speaker 1>They set up.</v>

109
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.100
<v Speaker 1>He goes,</v>

110
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.970
<v Speaker 1>fucking crazy.</v>

111
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.423
<v Speaker 1>And I went,</v>

112
00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.430
<v Speaker 1>I guess man,</v>

113
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.050
<v Speaker 1>that's why he's world champ.</v>

114
00:03:11.051 --> 00:03:15.130
<v Speaker 1>I tell Dick Jokes and your work at Costco because we think this is a game he</v>

115
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.350
<v Speaker 1>doesn't like.</v>

116
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:17.240
<v Speaker 1>There's no good.</v>

117
00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.800
<v Speaker 1>I'm on one second.</v>

118
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.531
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

119
00:03:20.531 --> 00:03:21.430
<v Speaker 1>that's hilarious.</v>

120
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.300
<v Speaker 1>They don't want you to win</v>

121
00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.851
<v Speaker 3>this sort of,</v>

122
00:03:22.851 --> 00:03:23.061
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

123
00:03:23.061 --> 00:03:23.651
<v Speaker 3>masculinity.</v>

124
00:03:23.651 --> 00:03:25.760
<v Speaker 3>So fragile managers socialized to be violent.</v>

125
00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.100
<v Speaker 3>They're not just socialized to be fine.</v>

126
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.620
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

127
00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:28.700
<v Speaker 3>this is a hormone thing.</v>

128
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.440
<v Speaker 3>Men just are more aggressive.</v>

129
00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.930
<v Speaker 3>And if you.</v>

130
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.070
<v Speaker 3>I means for instance in colleges,</v>

131
00:03:34.071 --> 00:03:34.251
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

132
00:03:34.251 --> 00:03:35.084
<v Speaker 3>If you,</v>

133
00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.270
<v Speaker 3>if you tell a women that the worst thing that's ever going to happen to them is</v>

134
00:03:38.271 --> 00:03:39.440
<v Speaker 3>somebody putting a hand on their,</v>

135
00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:43.040
<v Speaker 3>on their leg and you call that sexual assault and you put that in the sexual</v>

136
00:03:43.041 --> 00:03:44.870
<v Speaker 3>assault statistics and you know,</v>

137
00:03:44.871 --> 00:03:45.441
<v Speaker 3>you tell women,</v>

138
00:03:45.441 --> 00:03:45.591
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

139
00:03:45.591 --> 00:03:47.810
<v Speaker 3>you can wear whatever you want and you can go out with 3:00 AM wearing a</v>

140
00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:49.850
<v Speaker 3>miniskirt and no man has a right to look at you and you know,</v>

141
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.450
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

142
00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:51.710
<v Speaker 3>no victim blaming all the rest of it.</v>

143
00:03:51.711 --> 00:03:55.970
<v Speaker 3>You're telling women in fact that they can put themselves in danger and bad</v>

144
00:03:55.971 --> 00:03:57.380
<v Speaker 3>things are going to happen to those women.</v>

145
00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.630
<v Speaker 3>We do live in more civilized times,</v>

146
00:03:59.631 --> 00:04:02.000
<v Speaker 3>but we also have to recognize that there is something,</v>

147
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.530
<v Speaker 3>there is something dark and dangerous about men and it is what creates.</v>

148
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:07.940
<v Speaker 3>It's what it is,</v>

149
00:04:07.941 --> 00:04:12.080
<v Speaker 3>what has driven human civilization to the heights that it has arisen to.</v>

150
00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.600
<v Speaker 3>But it is also why men for most of the prisons,</v>

151
00:04:14.601 --> 00:04:14.900
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

152
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.900
<v Speaker 3>The sublime geniuses and the knuckle dragging apes of our species are both male.</v>

153
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.740
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

154
00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:22.160
<v Speaker 3>And that's.</v>

155
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.260
<v Speaker 3>And you can see that in a variety,</v>

156
00:04:24.261 --> 00:04:24.621
<v Speaker 3>different things.</v>

157
00:04:24.621 --> 00:04:25.730
<v Speaker 3>People don't take like you've very seriously,</v>

158
00:04:25.731 --> 00:04:26.181
<v Speaker 3>but you can see,</v>

159
00:04:26.181 --> 00:04:26.511
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>

160
00:04:26.511 --> 00:04:27.530
<v Speaker 3>in Icu distribution,</v>

161
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.020
<v Speaker 3>one of the suggestions that might be the case,</v>

162
00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.890
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

163
00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.120
<v Speaker 3>sublime musical and artistic geniuses up in the very top end of the Iq scale</v>

164
00:04:35.121 --> 00:04:36.470
<v Speaker 3>where women tend not to exist.</v>

165
00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:37.491
<v Speaker 3>Likewise,</v>

166
00:04:37.491 --> 00:04:37.730
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

167
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:38.620
<v Speaker 3>down in the knuckle draggers,</v>

168
00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:39.590
<v Speaker 3>70 and 80 Iq,</v>

169
00:04:39.591 --> 00:04:41.210
<v Speaker 3>women tend not to exist down there either.</v>

170
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.030
<v Speaker 3>Men are more variable than women in general.</v>

171
00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.880
<v Speaker 3>Men are more complex I think than women in some ways.</v>

172
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.190
<v Speaker 3>And this,</v>

173
00:04:49.191 --> 00:04:49.431
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

174
00:04:49.431 --> 00:04:49.671
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

175
00:04:49.671 --> 00:04:53.510
<v Speaker 3>the idea that you can just sort of buzzfeed your way out of rape and</v>

176
00:04:53.511 --> 00:04:55.340
<v Speaker 3>civilization is just insane.</v>

177
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.630
<v Speaker 1>Buzzfeed your way out,</v>

178
00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.990
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

179
00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.670
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>

180
00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:58.120
<v Speaker 1>if you just,</v>

181
00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.560
<v Speaker 1>if you publish enough listicles.</v>

182
00:04:59.561 --> 00:04:59.660
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

183
00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.830
<v Speaker 3>About how masculinity is so fragile and white,</v>

184
00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.511
<v Speaker 3>straight,</v>

185
00:05:02.511 --> 00:05:03.010
<v Speaker 3>white men are,</v>

186
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.810
<v Speaker 3>are the root of all evil that that's somehow going to stop rape?</v>

187
00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.171
<v Speaker 3>No,</v>

188
00:05:06.171 --> 00:05:06.621
<v Speaker 3>in fact,</v>

189
00:05:06.621 --> 00:05:08.050
<v Speaker 3>I think that's probably counterproductive.</v>

190
00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.580
<v Speaker 3>I think that's probably going to be going to push some men too,</v>

191
00:05:10.581 --> 00:05:10.970
<v Speaker 3>but you know,</v>

192
00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.360
<v Speaker 3>boil over because they're sick of being lied to enlight about.</v>

193
00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.940
<v Speaker 3>But the good news is rape has been going down for 30 years.</v>

194
00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:20.430
<v Speaker 3>American college campuses are probably the safest place you could possibly be as</v>

195
00:05:20.431 --> 00:05:20.541
<v Speaker 3>a,</v>

196
00:05:20.541 --> 00:05:21.920
<v Speaker 3>as a young woman in America today,</v>

197
00:05:21.921 --> 00:05:22.910
<v Speaker 3>despite what the left tells you,</v>

198
00:05:22.911 --> 00:05:23.900
<v Speaker 3>the lies it tells you about.</v>

199
00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.010
<v Speaker 3>Uh,</v>

200
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.280
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

201
00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.040
<v Speaker 3>about all sorts of things we're in.</v>

202
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.980
<v Speaker 3>We're in a good place,</v>

203
00:05:27.981 --> 00:05:30.860
<v Speaker 3>but the left won't say that or acknowledged victory because it will put them all</v>

204
00:05:30.861 --> 00:05:31.480
<v Speaker 3>out of business.</v>

205
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:31.601
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

206
00:05:31.601 --> 00:05:32.350
<v Speaker 1>I was out of,</v>

207
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.080
<v Speaker 1>I was out of that head chocolate.</v>

208
00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:37.140
<v Speaker 1>I didn't have enough chance to send the kit in the mail and get it.</v>

209
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:38.230
<v Speaker 1>So I just went to the store.</v>

210
00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:39.370
<v Speaker 1>I asked to,</v>

211
00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:40.410
<v Speaker 1>can I just want prone.</v>

212
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:45.450
<v Speaker 1>I didn't want to spend the $94 for the way because I didn't want to hold all</v>

213
00:05:45.491 --> 00:05:46.430
<v Speaker 1>that protein powder.</v>

214
00:05:46.431 --> 00:05:48.910
<v Speaker 1>So I went through the one on Lankershim and he goes,</v>

215
00:05:48.911 --> 00:05:50.380
<v Speaker 1>do you take the preworkout shit?</v>

216
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:51.220
<v Speaker 1>Like I don't take my,</v>

217
00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.750
<v Speaker 1>I take the fucking quadriceps.</v>

218
00:05:52.751 --> 00:05:53.610
<v Speaker 1>I didn't tell him that,</v>

219
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.761
<v Speaker 1>but I take the,</v>

220
00:05:54.761 --> 00:05:56.320
<v Speaker 1>I take like half of the shroom tech,</v>

221
00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.830
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

222
00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 1>I don't to have a fucking audit.</v>

223
00:05:58.011 --> 00:06:00.290
<v Speaker 1>They're going to take half of those fuckers tax,</v>

224
00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.160
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you're in the middle of class and get gasping for air because so much</v>

225
00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:06.410
<v Speaker 1>air is coming into you and my body can't take it.</v>

226
00:06:06.411 --> 00:06:07.310
<v Speaker 1>It's too much fucking.</v>

227
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.230
<v Speaker 1>And sometimes like you're like,</v>

228
00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:09.651
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

229
00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:10.490
<v Speaker 1>this is too much.</v>

230
00:06:10.491 --> 00:06:11.990
<v Speaker 1>So I just went there one day the guy goes,</v>

231
00:06:11.991 --> 00:06:12.471
<v Speaker 1>take this.</v>

232
00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:14.710
<v Speaker 1>It's like a drink before the fucking,</v>

233
00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:15.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

234
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:16.550
<v Speaker 1>before you work out again.</v>

235
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.150
<v Speaker 1>I had it in the bag and I drove and I get them.</v>

236
00:06:19.151 --> 00:06:19.311
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

237
00:06:19.311 --> 00:06:20.030
<v Speaker 1>let me just try.</v>

238
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:20.960
<v Speaker 1>I tried half of it.</v>

239
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.630
<v Speaker 1>I did the class,</v>

240
00:06:23.631 --> 00:06:25.790
<v Speaker 1>but on the way home I had the wildest fucking hot.</v>

241
00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:26.530
<v Speaker 1>I had to go home,</v>

242
00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:30.980
<v Speaker 1>take a shower and jerk off in the fucking shower because the heart with real</v>

243
00:06:30.981 --> 00:06:31.980
<v Speaker 1>mama wasn't on.</v>

244
00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.960
<v Speaker 1>Nobody was around.</v>

245
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.850
<v Speaker 1>I mean it was fucking evil.</v>

246
00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:36.830
<v Speaker 1>And even after I jerked off,</v>

247
00:06:36.831 --> 00:06:39.000
<v Speaker 1>it stayed hot dog and the shower,</v>

248
00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:39.470
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

249
00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:40.820
<v Speaker 1>Jesus fucking Christ,</v>

250
00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.840
<v Speaker 1>I got to save this shit and drink it with Mama's around these things.</v>

251
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.350
<v Speaker 1>But then I got scared because after I jerked off,</v>

252
00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:49.010
<v Speaker 1>like an hour later,</v>

253
00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.620
<v Speaker 1>my Hartstein that haven't popped up yet.</v>

254
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.580
<v Speaker 1>Then I'll put the shit enough with this,</v>

255
00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:55.910
<v Speaker 1>but I don't do anything.</v>

256
00:06:55.911 --> 00:06:56.510
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>

257
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:58.820
<v Speaker 1>I've never been a proponent.</v>

258
00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:59.510
<v Speaker 1>Is that the word?</v>

259
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.260
<v Speaker 1>Yes to fucking red bull because when I was shooting a movie once I was up all</v>

260
00:07:03.261 --> 00:07:03.471
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

261
00:07:03.471 --> 00:07:05.150
<v Speaker 1>You don't blow man.</v>

262
00:07:05.151 --> 00:07:07.430
<v Speaker 1>I fucking drank three of those red bulls when I fell asleep,</v>

263
00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:08.241
<v Speaker 1>so I said,</v>

264
00:07:08.241 --> 00:07:08.650
<v Speaker 1>fuck it.</v>

265
00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:09.200
<v Speaker 1>That's nothing.</v>

266
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.033
<v Speaker 1>That shit,</v>

267
00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:11.150
<v Speaker 1>that shit don't work.</v>

268
00:07:11.151 --> 00:07:12.350
<v Speaker 1>I drank three of those red bulls.</v>

269
00:07:12.351 --> 00:07:15.560
<v Speaker 1>There was no set so those things don't fucking work,</v>

270
00:07:15.561 --> 00:07:18.680
<v Speaker 1>so I've never been really been any energy drink.</v>

271
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.230
<v Speaker 1>I grew up with energy drinks.</v>

272
00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:22.250
<v Speaker 1>You'd expect me to like energy drinks.</v>

273
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.720
<v Speaker 1>I hate all that shit.</v>

274
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:24.793
<v Speaker 1>I don't believe it.</v>

275
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:26.930
<v Speaker 1>When I was a beginning comic,</v>

276
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.170
<v Speaker 1>I used to take no dollars to drive all night.</v>

277
00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:32.600
<v Speaker 1>That stuff's nasty.</v>

278
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:37.160
<v Speaker 1>Just when I would drink it with mountain dew and smoke a joint.</v>

279
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:38.263
<v Speaker 1>You drive off.</v>

280
00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:43.370
<v Speaker 1>Just look like that all night and then you pull over and take a nap and I would</v>

281
00:07:44.151 --> 00:07:46.310
<v Speaker 1>take an opera at the car because it was the winter,</v>

282
00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.200
<v Speaker 1>like in those days I had to drive.</v>

283
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:52.450
<v Speaker 1>I would have to do the late show as a feature and then drive back to boulder</v>

284
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:53.660
<v Speaker 1>overnight from Boise,</v>

285
00:07:53.661 --> 00:07:56.930
<v Speaker 1>Idaho or wherever the fuck I was in billings,</v>

286
00:07:56.931 --> 00:07:57.764
<v Speaker 1>Montana.</v>

287
00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:02.540
<v Speaker 1>So I would drive all night to get there to pick up the baby in those days I'd</v>

288
00:08:02.541 --> 00:08:03.770
<v Speaker 1>have to do whatever the fuck I had to do.</v>

289
00:08:03.771 --> 00:08:04.521
<v Speaker 1>One Night Jamie,</v>

290
00:08:04.521 --> 00:08:07.940
<v Speaker 1>I pulled the car over and it was freezing out and left the car running and I</v>

291
00:08:07.941 --> 00:08:11.210
<v Speaker 1>fell asleep and when I woke up I thought I lost control of the car.</v>

292
00:08:11.211 --> 00:08:13.220
<v Speaker 1>You have no idea what happens to your heart.</v>

293
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:14.030
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

294
00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:18.110
<v Speaker 1>When you fall asleep and then wake up and I had to have lights on and I saw the</v>

295
00:08:18.111 --> 00:08:20.120
<v Speaker 1>snow and I was like,</v>

296
00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:21.990
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

297
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:23.150
<v Speaker 1>and you grabbed the steering wheel.</v>

298
00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:23.930
<v Speaker 1>You put the brake on.</v>

299
00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:24.170
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

300
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.340
<v Speaker 1>I'm not even fucking moving.</v>

301
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:26.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh my God.</v>

302
00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:26.990
<v Speaker 1>So those.</v>

303
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:29.750
<v Speaker 1>No dozes with mountain dew with all my boy.</v>

304
00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:30.380
<v Speaker 1>There you go.</v>
