00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.310
<v Speaker 1>You dirty bitch and we're back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This episode of the Joe Rogan podcast is</v>

2
00:00:12.301 --> 00:00:17.301
<v Speaker 1>brought to you by ting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ting is a mobile phone companies that </v>

3
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.870
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about on this podcast many </v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

4
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.910
<v Speaker 1>one of my favorite sponsors because you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would think like if you look for </v>

5
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.910
<v Speaker 1>something cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd say,</v>

6
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.910
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

7
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.231
<v Speaker 1>maybe like a a company that sells </v>
<v Speaker 1>paintings is cool or a company that </v>

8
00:00:30.871 --> 00:00:35.871
<v Speaker 1>makes sculptures is cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't think of like cell phone </v>

9
00:00:35.871 --> 00:00:36.810
<v Speaker 1>companies as being cool like what are </v>
<v Speaker 1>they?</v>

10
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.840
<v Speaker 1>They're just cell phone companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when a cell phone company goes out </v>

11
00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.291
<v Speaker 1>of their way to give you a service that </v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all it's is like it's Kinda,</v>

12
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.310
<v Speaker 1>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a better deal.</v>

13
00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:48.840
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it feels more ethical.</v>

14
00:00:48.841 --> 00:00:53.841
<v Speaker 1>Like from a business standpoint.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They allow you to cancel your contract </v>

15
00:00:53.841 --> 00:00:55.710
<v Speaker 1>at any time they credit you on unused </v>
<v Speaker 1>service,</v>

16
00:00:55.711 --> 00:00:57.270
<v Speaker 1>which I've never heard of before.</v>

17
00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.030
<v Speaker 1>If you use less than you thought you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would,</v>

18
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.250
<v Speaker 1>ting actually drops you down and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>credit you the difference on your next </v>

19
00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.310
<v Speaker 1>bill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They drop you down to the next level.</v>

20
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Whatever you actually did use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten so many twitter messages </v>

21
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.491
<v Speaker 1>from people that tell me that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>saving money every month since I </v>

22
00:01:16.491 --> 00:01:16.491
<v Speaker 1>switched over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like one dude was.</v>

23
00:01:16.491 --> 00:01:20.850
<v Speaker 1>He was spending like 90 something </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars on another cell phone company </v>

24
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.530
<v Speaker 1>and he said he brought it down to 18.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that that's fucking insane.</v>

25
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.200
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what his use was like,</v>

26
00:01:25.201 --> 00:01:28.410
<v Speaker 1>but if he's telling the truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if he's not just some crazy troll making</v>

27
00:01:28.411 --> 00:01:30.060
<v Speaker 1>shit up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of verified or deny.</v>

28
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:35.290
<v Speaker 2>I bet he was like on an iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>barely using it on a verizon plan and </v>

29
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:36.290
<v Speaker 2>they switched down to like a galaxy s </v>
<v Speaker 2>three.</v>

30
00:01:36.291 --> 00:01:38.760
<v Speaker 2>You know what I mean?</v>

<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.030
<v Speaker 1>Every time we find out anything cool on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the web,</v>

118
00:05:40.031 --> 00:05:45.031
<v Speaker 1>like Blendtec blenders or when we found </v>
<v Speaker 1>out about bulletproof coffee and a lot </v>

119
00:05:45.031 --> 00:05:47.050
<v Speaker 1>of coffee has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to Dave Asprey,</v>

120
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.210
<v Speaker 1>lot of coffee that you're getting has </v>
<v Speaker 1>fungus on it,</v>

121
00:05:49.211 --> 00:05:50.740
<v Speaker 1>mycotoxins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

122
00:05:50.741 --> 00:05:55.741
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't get the same experience from </v>

123
00:05:55.741 --> 00:05:55.741
<v Speaker 1>drinking that as you do from a drinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>

124
00:05:55.741 --> 00:05:57.350
<v Speaker 1>That's fungus free confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fungus free.</v>

125
00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.380
<v Speaker 1>He believes is way less wearing on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

126
00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.740
<v Speaker 1>He thinks a lot of the crash that people</v>
<v Speaker 1>associate with drinking coffee is </v>

127
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.611
<v Speaker 1>actually your body reacting to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mycotoxins and regular good clean </v>

128
00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:12.200
<v Speaker 1>coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what he sells is called bulletproof</v>

129
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:17.120
<v Speaker 1>upgraded coffee is a mycotoxin free and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be drinking right now.</v>

130
00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.410
<v Speaker 1>St Michael or Mike.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike,</v>

131
00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:23.411
<v Speaker 1>go mycotoxins there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're tiny little fungi that grow all </v>

132
00:06:23.411 --> 00:06:25.010
<v Speaker 1>over coffee apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Haven't seen that show.</v>

133
00:06:25.011 --> 00:06:26.480
<v Speaker 1>Dangerous grinds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

134
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:28.610
<v Speaker 1>Or deadliest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever the fuck it was called.</v>

135
00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.940
<v Speaker 1>It was a guy would go all dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>grounds.</v>

136
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:37.030
<v Speaker 1>A guy would go all over the country to </v>
<v Speaker 1>really exotic places where they would </v>

137
00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:38.190
<v Speaker 1>make coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they grow coffee.</v>

138
00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.490
<v Speaker 1>It was a lot of coffee's grown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

139
00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.440
<v Speaker 1>Wanda and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some of the best is in Hawaiian.</v>

140
00:06:45.441 --> 00:06:46.200
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

141
00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:51.340
<v Speaker 1>but these,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it requires like a specific climate and </v>

142
00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:54.431
<v Speaker 1>this guy would go there and he said one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the real issues is an alum of this </v>

143
00:06:54.431 --> 00:06:54.431
<v Speaker 1>stuff gets toxic.</v>

144
00:06:54.431 --> 00:06:56.180
<v Speaker 1>It gets mold grows on it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you drink that,</v>

145
00:06:56.181 --> 00:06:58.240
<v Speaker 1>you're drinking like mold soup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

146
00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.480
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really interesting.</v>

147
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:01.190
<v Speaker 1>Totally makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally makes sense.</v>

148
00:07:01.191 --> 00:07:02.630
<v Speaker 1>And something nobody ever thought about </v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

149
00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:04.660
<v Speaker 1>but Dave asked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we thought about it and he,</v>

150
00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:07.010
<v Speaker 1>we were like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's sell Dave asprey shit.</v>

151
00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:10.670
<v Speaker 1>Let's sell bulletproof coffee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does he keep it from being a mold?</v>

152
00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:12.930
<v Speaker 1>They get it from a single source.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One.</v>

153
00:07:12.931 --> 00:07:16.400
<v Speaker 1>One company takes care of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From the moment the plant is grown,</v>

154
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:18.590
<v Speaker 1>they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all about putting it in the correct</v>

155
00:07:18.591 --> 00:07:23.591
<v Speaker 1>environment and making sure that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't have access or exposure to ntds </v>

156
00:07:23.591 --> 00:07:23.690
<v Speaker 1>funguses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

157
00:07:23.691 --> 00:07:25.220
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we,</v>

00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:18.620
<v Speaker 1>I'll never forget that trip for the rest</v>
<v Speaker 1>of my life.</v>

180
00:08:18.621 --> 00:08:23.621
<v Speaker 1>We had a great fucking time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I watched the episodes twice and I love </v>

181
00:08:23.621 --> 00:08:24.530
<v Speaker 1>them and I thought it was shot really </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

182
00:08:24.531 --> 00:08:26.600
<v Speaker 1>I thought the music was amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was amazing.</v>

183
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:31.900
<v Speaker 1>It turns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns you into blood brothers out in </v>

184
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:31.900
<v Speaker 1>the field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No doubt.</v>

185
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:32.130
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a totally.</v>

186
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:34.840
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to see how people respond to,</v>

187
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:39.230
<v Speaker 1>to like waking up in the fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>freezing cold and nobody bitched out.</v>

188
00:08:39.231 --> 00:08:41.750
<v Speaker 1>Everybody kept it together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's important.</v>

189
00:08:41.751 --> 00:08:46.751
<v Speaker 1>You can take some fucking set through </v>
<v Speaker 1>green type characters with a on the </v>

190
00:08:46.751 --> 00:08:46.751
<v Speaker 1>road.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

191
00:08:46.751 --> 00:08:47.540
<v Speaker 1>Seth Green.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know why I picked on you.</v>

192
00:08:48.370 --> 00:08:49.550
<v Speaker 1>How about me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about Joe Rogan,</v>

193
00:08:49.551 --> 00:08:54.551
<v Speaker 1>tub chair white.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That doesn't make sense because I did </v>

194
00:08:54.551 --> 00:08:56.381
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean there's a lot of people out </v>

195
00:08:56.381 --> 00:08:56.381
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry Seth,</v>

196
00:08:56.381 --> 00:08:56.381
<v Speaker 1>I have no reason to take shots at you.</v>

197
00:08:56.381 --> 00:09:01.370
<v Speaker 3>Do you know?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did I tell you that what they </v>

198
00:09:01.370 --> 00:09:02.751
<v Speaker 3>anthropologists,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they did that study about how men who </v>

199
00:09:02.751 --> 00:09:05.721
<v Speaker 3>show up in a bar all done up and jewelry</v>
<v Speaker 3>and and why they get beaten up </v>

200
00:09:05.731 --> 00:09:10.731
<v Speaker 3>traditionally or why,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why there was this so much like actual </v>

201
00:09:10.731 --> 00:09:13.910
<v Speaker 3>violent pressure for men to actually </v>
<v Speaker 3>conform to a haircut and to a look like </v>

202
00:09:13.910 --> 00:09:14.760
<v Speaker 3>they.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The joke is men,</v>

203
00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.640
<v Speaker 3>they have two criteria for how they </v>
<v Speaker 3>dressed.</v>

204
00:09:16.641 --> 00:09:20.370
<v Speaker 3>They don't want to look like a pussy and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they want to be comfortable and and they</v>

205
00:09:20.371 --> 00:09:22.320
<v Speaker 3>mainly don't want to bring attention to </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>

206
00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:24.690
<v Speaker 3>Like you don't see a guy unless you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>wearing that ned retardy shirt,</v>

207
00:09:24.691 --> 00:09:27.420
<v Speaker 3>but you know those guys usually they </v>
<v Speaker 3>jacked and ready.</v>

208
00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:32.010
<v Speaker 3>But for the most part men will wear </v>
<v Speaker 3>things that are like blues and grays and</v>

209
00:09:32.011 --> 00:09:33.510
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>simple stuff.</v>

210
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:37.440
<v Speaker 3>Because this part at the Santa Claus was</v>
<v Speaker 3>talking about the idea that if you.</v>

211
00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.130
<v Speaker 3>It goes back to how men used to hunt in </v>
<v Speaker 3>groups and if a man,</v>

212
00:09:41.131 --> 00:09:43.620
<v Speaker 3>if you guys were all set and we're going</v>
<v Speaker 3>to go hunting and all of a sudden I show</v>

213
00:09:43.621 --> 00:09:46.190
<v Speaker 3>up and a bunch of sparkly shit and </v>
<v Speaker 3>bangles.</v>

214
00:09:46.191 --> 00:09:51.191
<v Speaker 3>They're making a bunch of noise.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You guys come in and you're gonna spoke </v>

215
00:09:51.191 --> 00:09:54.021
<v Speaker 3>to fucking deer.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They can see it a mile away and you're </v>

216
00:09:54.021 --> 00:09:54.021
<v Speaker 3>making like hanging,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hanging.</v>

217
00:09:54.021 --> 00:09:57.150
<v Speaker 3>But I like these and I don't know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting shut down,</v>

218
00:09:57.151 --> 00:10:02.151
<v Speaker 3>son.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want to hear your point of view on it </v>

219
00:10:02.151 --> 00:10:02.151
<v Speaker 3>because look at how.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

220
00:10:02.151 --> 00:10:02.670
<v Speaker 4>look at the way that a lot of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

221
00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:07.720
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of indigenous hunters today still will </v>

222
00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:07.720
<v Speaker 4>adorn themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

223
00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:07.720
<v Speaker 4>But they don't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they for not,</v>

224
00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:09.170
<v Speaker 4>not when they rented though,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

225
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:11.090
<v Speaker 4>Isn't that for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>for positioning,</v>

226
00:10:11.091 --> 00:10:12.550
<v Speaker 4>dancing stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but not all.</v>

227
00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:17.560
<v Speaker 4>Like you might go and you might go to or</v>
<v Speaker 4>go into battle with like face paint or </v>

228
00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:21.971
<v Speaker 4>elaborate jewelry or there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's so many accounts of like </v>

229
00:10:21.971 --> 00:10:25.750
<v Speaker 4>command.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She who would wear wedding veils and </v>

230
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.260
<v Speaker 4>stuff that they gathered during raids </v>
<v Speaker 4>and just crazy.</v>

231
00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.630
<v Speaker 4>I would always wear a wedding baile.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that's,</v>

232
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.500
<v Speaker 4>I don't want the deer to see what my </v>
<v Speaker 4>expression change your,</v>

233
00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.000
<v Speaker 4>your thing that I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I,</v>

234
00:10:35.001 --> 00:10:37.060
<v Speaker 4>that I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I contested it and I don't,</v>

235
00:10:37.090 --> 00:10:42.090
<v Speaker 4>I don't mean.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't mean to aggregate on the final </v>

236
00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:43.740
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it reminds me of what it reminds me </v>

237
00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.401
<v Speaker 4>of something similar that's equally </v>
<v Speaker 4>interesting and just like I was reading </v>

238
00:10:45.401 --> 00:10:50.351
<v Speaker 4>this book on human evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was arguing how could it ever be be </v>

239
00:10:50.351 --> 00:10:52.550
<v Speaker 4>beneficial to be a daredevil,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

240
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:55.370
<v Speaker 4>They'd be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what is the selective advantage to being</v>

241
00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.160
<v Speaker 4>a daredevil?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And this guy argues that it's,</v>

242
00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:01.520
<v Speaker 4>you're saying to a man is saying to </v>
<v Speaker 4>females,</v>

243
00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.760
<v Speaker 4>you're like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I am so ridiculously fit.</v>

244
00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.020
<v Speaker 4>You know that I can do something so </v>
<v Speaker 4>stupid.</v>

245
00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:10.880
<v Speaker 4>Instill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>thrive,</v>

246
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:11.930
<v Speaker 4>instill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>still breed.</v>

247
00:11:11.940 --> 00:11:14.390
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like that's how I did it.</v>

248
00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:14.490
<v Speaker 4>I</v>

249
00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:19.490
<v Speaker 5>think we ended with this shit like </v>
<v Speaker 5>wingsuits fighting bulls.</v>

250
00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:23.940
<v Speaker 5>Men would fight bulls.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Fighting Bulls is kind of a scam because</v>

251
00:11:23.941 --> 00:11:28.941
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of other dudes involved.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like it's not just a matador and the </v>

252
00:11:28.941 --> 00:11:28.980
<v Speaker 5>bull.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's other dudes stabbing the bull.</v>

253
00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.700
<v Speaker 5>They put poison darts into the bowl to </v>
<v Speaker 5>creepy shit.</v>

254
00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.410
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

255
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:39.440
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's another dude that stabbed the </v>

256
00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:39.440
<v Speaker 5>bull.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

257
00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:39.440
<v Speaker 5>the peccadilloes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

258
00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.960
<v Speaker 5>but when you're in a fucking wingsuit,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're in a wingsuit.</v>

259
00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:44.850
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Those crazy assholes that jump off those</v>

260
00:11:44.851 --> 00:11:47.670
<v Speaker 5>mountains and they're going 100 miles an</v>
<v Speaker 5>hour and those suits.</v>

261
00:11:47.820 --> 00:11:51.000
<v Speaker 5>Have you seen him fly through cities </v>
<v Speaker 5>like through the middle of buildings?</v>

262
00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:52.140
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>dude.</v>

263
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:53.980
<v Speaker 5>There's a guy jumps out of</v>

264
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:56.430
<v Speaker 1>a plane in fucking Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

265
00:11:56.620 --> 00:12:01.620
<v Speaker 1>Jumps out of a plane and does this wing </v>
<v Speaker 1>suit shit and he goes flying over the </v>

266
00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:06.361
<v Speaker 1>city through buildings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a gap in between these two </v>

267
00:12:06.361 --> 00:12:09.841
<v Speaker 1>buildings and he shoots through these </v>
<v Speaker 1>two buildings before he pulls his </v>

268
00:12:09.841 --> 00:12:12.880
<v Speaker 1>parachute and land flapping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gliding.</v>

269
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:18.030
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hurts your head when you're watching </v>

270
00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:19.330
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is it going to fucking die?</v>

271
00:12:19.331 --> 00:12:20.430
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

272
00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.570

273
00:12:22.571 --> 00:12:23.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

274
00:12:23.711 --> 00:12:25.300
<v Speaker 1>I don't know how much you can really </v>
<v Speaker 1>steer it.</v>

275
00:12:25.301 --> 00:12:28.300
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess this guy he and see.</v>

276
00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:29.140
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

277
00:12:29.910 --> 00:12:31.480
<v Speaker 1>Are you kidding?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>

278
00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:33.520
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's him and the wing suit.</v>

<v Speaker 6>sponsored by red.</v>

288
00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:58.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was more endorsed,</v>

00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:08.480
<v Speaker 6>It's death defying.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Not to mention illegal jump.</v>

291
00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:13.580
<v Speaker 6>The team took it this at 5:45</v>
<v Speaker 6>AM there 20 minutes before the first </v>

292
00:13:13.801 --> 00:13:16.170
<v Speaker 6>commercial flight would appear on real.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Supervise it.</v>

293
00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:19.570
<v Speaker 6>Oh my God.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Imagine you gotta be</v>

294
00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:24.600
<v Speaker 1>calculate when the first flight takes </v>
<v Speaker 1>off in the air by a fucking plane going </v>

295
00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:27.130
<v Speaker 1>500 miles an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

296
00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:32.270
<v Speaker 1>Do you think you can time the plane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how fast the planes coming at you as </v>

297
00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:33.560
<v Speaker 1>you're flying down towards the 600 miles</v>
<v Speaker 1>an hour you.</v>

298
00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:36.570
<v Speaker 1>You ain't gotten away from that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a rocket ship.</v>

299
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:40.560
<v Speaker 1>And so if that guy lands and in a woman </v>
<v Speaker 1>is like,</v>

300
00:13:40.561 --> 00:13:45.561
<v Speaker 1>I am so impressed by that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to go out with you for drinks </v>

301
00:13:45.561 --> 00:13:48.981
<v Speaker 1>tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would demonstrate that there's a </v>

302
00:13:48.981 --> 00:13:48.981
<v Speaker 1>selective advantage there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

303
00:13:48.981 --> 00:13:50.670
<v Speaker 1>there's a selective advantage and being </v>
<v Speaker 1>a daredevil.</v>

304
00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:51.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's definitely.</v>

305
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:56.990
<v Speaker 1>That totally makes sense evolutionarily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it also makes sense that we have a </v>

306
00:13:56.990 --> 00:14:01.551
<v Speaker 1>disdain for people that are like wearing</v>
<v Speaker 1>jewelry and dress and flashy and </v>

307
00:14:01.551 --> 00:14:05.720
<v Speaker 1>tracking a lot of attention to the to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves because classically that that </v>

308
00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.000
<v Speaker 1>person who like aims to stand out so </v>
<v Speaker 1>strongly ruins everything.</v>

309
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:11.760
<v Speaker 1>They get too loud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they turn things into fights,</v>

310
00:14:11.761 --> 00:14:16.761
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the person is like really loud and </v>

311
00:14:16.761 --> 00:14:18.060
<v Speaker 1>flamboyant and they usually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just a natural instinct.</v>

312
00:14:18.061 --> 00:14:19.980
<v Speaker 1>It's the feeling you get is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

313
00:14:19.981 --> 00:14:21.510
<v Speaker 1>look at this fucking guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>

314
00:14:21.690 --> 00:14:26.690
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is this guy going to bring to the </v>

315
00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:26.690
<v Speaker 1>party?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like what?</v>

316
00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:26.690
<v Speaker 1>He's not a team player.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's not,</v>

317
00:14:26.690 --> 00:14:28.560
<v Speaker 1>he's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's some crazy asshole with jewelry on.</v>

318
00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:31.650
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's he doing like criss angel?</v>

319
00:14:31.710 --> 00:14:33.510
<v Speaker 1>Why is he wearing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I get annoyed at Chris Angel,</v>

320
00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.900
<v Speaker 1>because he's too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's too into his body and he's doing it</v>

321
00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:37.700
<v Speaker 1>was ripped jeans and I'm always like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

322
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.540
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure I'd like them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I see them I'm like,</v>

323
00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:41.460
<v Speaker 1>punch that guy in the face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

324
00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:43.980
<v Speaker 1>The fact that he's really muscular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kind of a good looking guy,</v>

325
00:14:43.981 --> 00:14:45.730
<v Speaker 1>so I'm a little jealous of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

326
00:14:45.731 --> 00:14:48.300
<v Speaker 1>my and I don't like that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe I'm a little attractive.</v>

327
00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:52.070
<v Speaker 1>That's probably one of the best ways to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get girls ever to be a beautiful</v>

332
00:14:58.810 --> 00:15:03.810

333
00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:03.810
<v Speaker 3>advantage in that way.</v>

00:15:33.950 --> 00:15:36.230
<v Speaker 3>David Lane,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who tried to fight Mike Tyson,</v>

349
00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:41.460
<v Speaker 3>what's his story?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tried to fight my david on the on the </v>

350
00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:41.460
<v Speaker 3>street and he's.</v>

351
00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:42.540
<v Speaker 3>He's just checked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

352
00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:44.960
<v Speaker 3>he felt like me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he was just so muscular.</v>

353
00:15:44.961 --> 00:15:45.440
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>david,</v>

354
00:15:45.441 --> 00:15:46.040
<v Speaker 3>what are you doing?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

355
00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:49.010
<v Speaker 3>I was training for eight months to fight</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike Tyson,</v>

356
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:51.110
<v Speaker 3>and when he went to a trainer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it might've been teddy atlas,</v>

357
00:15:51.111 --> 00:15:51.650
<v Speaker 3>something.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

358
00:15:51.830 --> 00:15:53.550
<v Speaker 3>I want to find my tights.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I think,</v>

359
00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:55.190
<v Speaker 3>I think it was teddy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry david.</v>

360
00:15:55.191 --> 00:15:56.540
<v Speaker 3>If someone like that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

361
00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:57.980
<v Speaker 3>the trainer goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

362
00:15:57.981 --> 00:15:59.630
<v Speaker 3>what's the trick?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And david said,</v>

363
00:15:59.631 --> 00:16:01.820
<v Speaker 3>nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I just want to last three rounds and the</v>

364
00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:04.340
<v Speaker 3>trend goes not in this lifetime.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

365
00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:05.300
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've got to think of.</v>

366
00:16:05.301 --> 00:16:06.200
<v Speaker 3>I train hard.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

367
00:16:06.530 --> 00:16:11.530
<v Speaker 3>you're not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm not training you to fight Mike </v>

368
00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:11.530
<v Speaker 3>Tyson.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You won't last five seconds.</v>

369
00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:11.990
<v Speaker 3>You never fought in your life.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're a magician.</v>

370
00:16:11.991 --> 00:16:13.460
<v Speaker 3>If there's not a trick,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to haPpen.</v>

371
00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:14.900
<v Speaker 3>And Mike Tyson,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

372
00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:15.840
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

373
00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.580
<v Speaker 3>David's magic apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So.</v>

374
00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:22.760
<v Speaker 3>So that didn't happen.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So he goes to another trainer and the </v>

375
00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:22.760
<v Speaker 3>trainer goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the trick?</v>

376
00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:22.970
<v Speaker 3>And a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because there's no trick,</v>

377
00:16:22.971 --> 00:16:23.690
<v Speaker 3>I just want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

378
00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:26.180
<v Speaker 3>I'll take your money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it ain't gonna happen.</v>

379
00:16:26.181 --> 00:16:27.080
<v Speaker 3>I'm gonna tell you up front.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

380
00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:27.290
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

381
00:16:27.291 --> 00:16:32.291
<v Speaker 3>I want to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So david pays him a crazy amount of </v>

382
00:16:32.291 --> 00:16:32.291
<v Speaker 3>money and they start any trains for six </v>
<v Speaker 3>months.</v>

383
00:16:32.291 --> 00:16:34.100
<v Speaker 3>And finally they put him in the ring </v>
<v Speaker 3>with his cruiser weight.</v>

384
00:16:34.130 --> 00:16:35.780
<v Speaker 3>Just a guy who's their cruiser,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

385
00:16:35.781 --> 00:16:36.890
<v Speaker 3>Tall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thin guys,</v>

386
00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:38.900
<v Speaker 3>you know who can,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who can box.</v>

387
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:42.590
<v Speaker 3>And david said that david said that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy jabbed him once,</v>

388
00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:43.820
<v Speaker 3>bam.</v>
<v Speaker 3>AnD they went,</v>

389
00:16:43.850 --> 00:16:45.560
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

390
00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.350
<v Speaker 3>he thought I was going to die.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And the guy goes,</v>

391
00:16:48.351 --> 00:16:48.710
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right.</v>

392
00:16:48.711 --> 00:16:49.720
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't.</v>

393
00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:51.350
<v Speaker 3>And then he hit him again.</v>

394
00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.820
<v Speaker 3>And david was Like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's it.</v>

395
00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:55.310
<v Speaker 3>I can't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He took two jobs because I can't fight.</v>

396
00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:56.870
<v Speaker 3>This is crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He'd never,</v>

397
00:16:56.871 --> 00:16:58.820
<v Speaker 3>he had no idea how hard somebody could </v>
<v Speaker 3>hit.</v>

398
00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:04.060
<v Speaker 3>And the guy goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we've been telling you that the whole </v>

399
00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.831
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's a jab from a cruiserweight who's </v>

400
00:17:05.831 --> 00:17:08.410
<v Speaker 3>not even a top pro if you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 3>about one of the hardest hitters in the </v>

401
00:17:08.410 --> 00:17:08.750
<v Speaker 3>game of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They was like,</v>

402
00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:10.300
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well I guess I could never do that.</v>

403
00:17:10.310 --> 00:17:12.230
<v Speaker 3>When was he trying to do?</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a long tiMe ago.</v>

404
00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.440
<v Speaker 3>I like when mike Tyson was boxing still </v>
<v Speaker 3>a.</v>

405
00:17:15.441 --> 00:17:17.510
<v Speaker 3>It was right when he retired,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I believe.</v>

406
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:20.750
<v Speaker 3>Right when they with Mike Tyson do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's ridiculous.</v>

407
00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.240
<v Speaker 3>Why would he think that Mike Tyson was </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to do the.</v>

408
00:17:23.241 --> 00:17:28.241
<v Speaker 3>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'll talk to dave and I'll come back </v>

409
00:17:28.241 --> 00:17:30.161
<v Speaker 3>with,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's kind of insulting for him to </v>

410
00:17:30.161 --> 00:17:33.371
<v Speaker 3>even think that Mike Tyson one,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the greatest fighters of all time would </v>

411
00:17:33.371 --> 00:17:33.371
<v Speaker 3>be willing to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

412
00:17:33.371 --> 00:17:36.050
<v Speaker 3>david's david's kind of guy who just </v>
<v Speaker 3>loves endurance.</v>

413
00:17:36.051 --> 00:17:37.970
<v Speaker 3>He loves thinking about the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the hardest thing to do,</v>

414
00:17:37.971 --> 00:17:42.971
<v Speaker 3>like he wanted to cross.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if I can say it on air </v>

415
00:17:42.971 --> 00:17:42.971
<v Speaker 3>because he made me a fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Only has.</v>

416
00:17:42.971 --> 00:17:47.690
<v Speaker 3>I mean even though Mike Tyson would run </v>
<v Speaker 3>through him like a hot samurai sword </v>

417
00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:47.990
<v Speaker 3>through a molten piece of butter.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

418
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:49.980
<v Speaker 3>Fighter only has a certain amount of </v>
<v Speaker 3>fights in</v>

419
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:54.980
<v Speaker 1>his life in a certain amount of times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can punch him in the head with your </v>

420
00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:55.200
<v Speaker 1>hands without them breaking certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of times.</v>

421
00:17:55.201 --> 00:17:57.660
<v Speaker 1>You can explode moving on somebody and </v>
<v Speaker 1>not tear a muscle.</v>

422
00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:02.900
<v Speaker 1>You only have a certain amount of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>lights that Mike Tyson would waste one </v>

423
00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:03.060
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if it would be a quick crushing,</v>

424
00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:08.540
<v Speaker 1>why would he waste one of those?</v>
<v Speaker 1>FighTing a guy like that's so arrogant </v>

425
00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:09.730
<v Speaker 1>like he should have fucking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You really think you.</v>

426
00:18:09.731 --> 00:18:11.490
<v Speaker 1>You could be a boxer and fight Mike </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tyson.</v>

427
00:18:11.610 --> 00:18:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Have an amateur fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just one image.</v>

428
00:18:13.930 --> 00:18:15.990
<v Speaker 1>I think a lot of guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes back to what we were saying.</v>

429
00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:18.570
<v Speaker 1>A lot of Dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we meet a lot of these guys in la.</v>

430
00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:23.130
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys don't really understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it's like to be hit by somebody who</v>

431
00:18:23.131 --> 00:18:25.620
<v Speaker 1>can really hit you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have that experience.</v>

432
00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:30.650
<v Speaker 1>You are you are you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your experience comes from what movies </v>

433
00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:34.550
<v Speaker 1>where you see a guy get punched in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>face and he comes back and hits against </v>

434
00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:34.550
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think that's how it is.</v>

435
00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:38.780
<v Speaker 1>Until you get hit by a guy who really </v>
<v Speaker 1>understands how to hit and your whole </v>

436
00:18:38.780 --> 00:18:39.780
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your whole world changes,</v>

437
00:18:40.910 --> 00:18:45.910
<v Speaker 1>it's very difficult to relax to when </v>
<v Speaker 1>someone's hitting you and one of the </v>

438
00:18:45.910 --> 00:18:49.200
<v Speaker 1>things that happens to people as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>freak out and there's their stress level</v>

439
00:18:49.201 --> 00:18:54.201
<v Speaker 1>goes up so high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they lose complete control of their </v>

440
00:18:54.201 --> 00:18:55.080
<v Speaker 1>ability to control their breath and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>get exhausted and they fall apart.</v>

441
00:18:55.081 --> 00:18:57.170
<v Speaker 1>It's like one of tHe main things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened.</v>

442
00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:01.470
<v Speaker 1>It's because they can't process the </v>
<v Speaker 1>actual reality of getting hit.</v>

443
00:19:01.770 --> 00:19:06.770
<v Speaker 1>If you've been hit before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can calm yourself down like even </v>

444
00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:06.770
<v Speaker 1>though you know that like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

445
00:19:06.770 --> 00:19:08.280
<v Speaker 1>I just got hit hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we got to keep moving.</v>

446
00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.050
<v Speaker 1>We got it open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep your eyes open,</v>

447
00:19:10.051 --> 00:19:15.051
<v Speaker 1>hands up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you start like calming yourself </v>

448
00:19:15.051 --> 00:19:17.241
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a process you have to get </v>

449
00:19:17.241 --> 00:19:17.241
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

450
00:19:17.241 --> 00:19:18.000
<v Speaker 1>really used to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You ever see boxers were the gods taking</v>

451
00:19:18.001 --> 00:19:23.001
<v Speaker 1>a jab and then he has his eyes open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is countering eyes open while guys </v>

452
00:19:23.001 --> 00:19:26.280
<v Speaker 1>touched on their face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like they get so comfortable with it.</v>

453
00:19:26.281 --> 00:19:28.950
<v Speaker 1>They eat jabs with their eyes open.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's incredible.</v>

454
00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:30.540
<v Speaker 1>DIaz.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nick diaz is really good at that.</v>

455
00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:32.940
<v Speaker 1>Nick diaz can actually eat your jab and </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep coming.</v>

456
00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.910
<v Speaker 1>He's one of the few guys I've seen who </v>
<v Speaker 1>has got that.</v>

457
00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:40.940
<v Speaker 1>That's a good move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He just always get the fuck away from </v>

458
00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:40.940
<v Speaker 1>punches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

459

<v Speaker 1>No one was.</v>

462
00:19:52.290 --> 00:19:53.300

<v Speaker 1>What's that guy from siberia was the </v>

466
00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:00.560
<v Speaker 1>fight of the year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just recently.</v>

467
00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:01.970
<v Speaker 1>It was the craziest thing I've ever seen</v>
<v Speaker 1>in my life together.</v>

468
00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:03.780
<v Speaker 1>He fought in rocky three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

469
00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.180
<v Speaker 1>this siberian guy fights out of freddy </v>
<v Speaker 1>roach,</v>

470
00:20:06.181 --> 00:20:09.630
<v Speaker 1>his gym,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was the craziest thing.</v>

471
00:20:09.631 --> 00:20:10.560
<v Speaker 1>It's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the.</v>

472
00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:12.240
<v Speaker 1>It's the school.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

473
00:20:12.241 --> 00:20:13.470
<v Speaker 1>I know exactly what you're talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

474
00:20:13.471 --> 00:20:16.470
<v Speaker 1>Russia eyes were shut.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a crazy fight.</v>

475
00:20:16.471 --> 00:20:21.471
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't tell anybody what happens because </v>

476
00:20:21.471 --> 00:20:21.471
<v Speaker 1>it's so crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

477
00:20:21.471 --> 00:20:23.880
<v Speaker 1>it's the best part of it makes you </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who have no respect for that,</v>

478
00:20:23.881 --> 00:20:28.881
<v Speaker 1>like people who have never been beaten.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You don't have any idea like what those </v>

479
00:20:28.881 --> 00:20:31.470
<v Speaker 1>guys are sacrificing to try to entertain</v>
<v Speaker 1>people like it's the most.</v>

480
00:20:31.471 --> 00:20:36.471
<v Speaker 1>It's the biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest sacrifice you could ever </v>

481
00:20:36.471 --> 00:20:36.480
<v Speaker 1>make physically without dying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is.</v>

482
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:39.300
<v Speaker 1>And what's really interesting is some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have a genetic,</v>

483
00:20:39.330 --> 00:20:44.330
<v Speaker 1>like an ability to take punches that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that you as a human being should never </v>

484
00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:44.970
<v Speaker 1>be able to deal with.</v>

485
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:50.200
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like even watching big country when he </v>

486
00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:50.200
<v Speaker 1>was taking those knees to the face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever see that?</v>

487
00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.210
<v Speaker 1>Then you call the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Incredible.</v>

488
00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:56.320
<v Speaker 1>Like how he can take that kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>punishment to his head as the nuttiest </v>

489
00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:59.581
<v Speaker 1>thing I've ever thought of it as it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>mine to a lot of it is your </v>

490
00:20:59.581 --> 00:20:59.860
<v Speaker 1>determination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Does the physical building your face.</v>

491
00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:05.010
<v Speaker 1>That's one big piece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mark hunt like that big fucking thick </v>

492
00:21:05.010 --> 00:21:05.350
<v Speaker 1>head.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That samoan hell.</v>

493
00:21:05.351 --> 00:21:06.250
<v Speaker 1>What'd you say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The physical.</v>

494
00:21:06.251 --> 00:21:08.500
<v Speaker 1>What are your face?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Physical build of your face?</v>

495
00:21:08.501 --> 00:21:13.501
<v Speaker 1>Construction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems that guys with really thin </v>

496
00:21:13.501 --> 00:21:16.630
<v Speaker 1>faces like narrow jaws have more of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue with getting knocked out.</v>

497
00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:21.810
<v Speaker 1>Whereas big square jawed guys are </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting trainers look for.</v>

498
00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:27.840
<v Speaker 1>They look for a short neck and a wide </v>
<v Speaker 1>face that supposedly as the david to a </v>

499
00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:31.420
<v Speaker 1>perfect example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the best chins of all time,</v>

500
00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:35.010
<v Speaker 1>like lennox lewis cracked him on the jaw</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he just flopped,</v>

501
00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:37.480
<v Speaker 1>sort of wobbles back and forth and keeps</v>
<v Speaker 1>moving forward.</v>

502
00:21:37.780 --> 00:21:41.290
<v Speaker 1>And david had a ridiculous and its head </v>
<v Speaker 1>is as wide as a football field.</v>

503
00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:42.730
<v Speaker 1>I know his,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know his,</v>

504
00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:42.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

505
00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.360
<v Speaker 3>I worked out with his strength coach for</v>
<v Speaker 3>and who got him ready for,</v>

506
00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:51.380
<v Speaker 3>for his first fight.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And hIs strength coach said that david </v>

507
00:21:51.380 --> 00:21:54.640
<v Speaker 3>had never squatted and he put them on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the squat rack.</v>

508
00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:57.730
<v Speaker 3>we put four 90 on the squat rack and </v>
<v Speaker 3>two,</v>

509
00:21:57.740 --> 00:21:58.930
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>went from.</v>

510
00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:00.030
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>

511
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:01.910
<v Speaker 3>he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he went from d,</v>

512
00:22:01.930 --> 00:22:05.380
<v Speaker 3>took them wait 490 pounds and didn't do </v>
<v Speaker 3>a regular squat.</v>

513
00:22:05.381 --> 00:22:10.381
<v Speaker 3>He did a deep squat.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He did an all the way down squat and </v>

514
00:22:10.381 --> 00:22:12.010
<v Speaker 3>then came back up with no problem and he</v>
<v Speaker 3>was like,</v>

515
00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:14.080
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how much Do you practice squatting?</v>

516
00:22:14.081 --> 00:22:14.560
<v Speaker 3>And two,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was like,</v>

517
00:22:14.561 --> 00:22:16.130
<v Speaker 3>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't practice squatting.</v>

518
00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:17.610
<v Speaker 3>I'm just,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

519
00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:19.780
<v Speaker 3>how much weight was that?</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>

520
00:22:19.781 --> 00:22:21.850
<v Speaker 3>that was 490 pounds with no belt or </v>
<v Speaker 3>anything.</v>

521
00:22:21.851 --> 00:22:26.851
<v Speaker 3>You just put it on your body and went </v>
<v Speaker 3>all the way down because you're not </v>

522
00:22:26.851 --> 00:22:29.521
<v Speaker 3>supposed to go all the way down and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>just have to go down to like where you </v>

523
00:22:29.521 --> 00:22:29.521
<v Speaker 3>put your button.</v>

524
00:22:29.521 --> 00:22:32.700
<v Speaker 1>Shitty trainer is that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well why the fuck did you put too much </v>

525
00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:32.750
<v Speaker 1>weight on and why did he tell him how to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do it?</v>

526
00:22:32.751 --> 00:22:36.410
<v Speaker 1>First trainer sounds like a douche bag.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That story sucks,</v>

527
00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:37.540
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey man,</v>

528
00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:38.790
<v Speaker 1>about that man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Henry,</v>

529
00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:43.010
<v Speaker 1>let me retell it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>warmed them up.</v>

530
00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:44.900
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is definitely important.</v>

531
00:22:44.930 --> 00:22:46.460
<v Speaker 1>You got to edit that one a little bit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

532
00:22:46.461 --> 00:22:50.510
<v Speaker 1>Squatting doesn't help with hunting when</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're out there trying to stalk a deer.</v>

533
00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:52.100
<v Speaker 1>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I disagree with you.</v>

534
00:22:52.101 --> 00:22:54.290
<v Speaker 1>I think all those bodyweight squats I </v>
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>

535
00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:55.880
<v Speaker 1>That totally helped me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't hike.</v>

536
00:22:55.940 --> 00:22:57.410
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I never go hiking.</v>

537
00:22:57.650 --> 00:23:00.440
<v Speaker 1>We were hiking for fucking hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was like,</v>

538
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:01.970
<v Speaker 1>there's a couple points where I was </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

539
00:23:01.971 --> 00:23:04.220
<v Speaker 1>whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I'm breathing really heavy.</v>

540
00:23:04.221 --> 00:23:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a really taxing,</v>

541
00:23:06.130 --> 00:23:11.130
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and someone who's in shitty shape and </v>

542
00:23:11.130 --> 00:23:11.870
<v Speaker 1>you try to do that badlands hiking all </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

543
00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:13.360
<v Speaker 1>You're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not good for you.</v>

544
00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:15.660
<v Speaker 1>When we had to have out all that meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

545
00:23:15.670 --> 00:23:19.310
<v Speaker 1>Well it was a small thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was happy and I was like,</v>

546
00:23:19.311 --> 00:23:22.460
<v Speaker 1>I was concentrating peculiar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>

547
00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:23.080
<v Speaker 1>like a peculiar</v>

548
00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:28.080
<v Speaker 4>kind of in shape,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just like walking around on uneven </v>

549
00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:28.600
<v Speaker 4>ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

550
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:33.710
<v Speaker 4>Know I remember when I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I grew up in Michigan and you </v>

551
00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:34.030
<v Speaker 4>couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you couldn't find a good,</v>

552
00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.850
<v Speaker 4>you couldn't find where you could,</v>
<v Speaker 4>where you needed to walk,</v>

553
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:37.710
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a,</v>

554
00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:40.360
<v Speaker 4>like a mile walk.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It'd be a big walk there.</v>

555
00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:42.850
<v Speaker 4>And um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we were,</v>

556
00:23:42.910 --> 00:23:47.910
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we all consider ourselves pretty about </v>

557
00:23:47.910 --> 00:23:50.590
<v Speaker 4>that kind of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like honing in Michigan and traffic and </v>

558
00:23:50.590 --> 00:23:52.811
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I moved out west and first started </v>

559
00:23:52.811 --> 00:23:53.900
<v Speaker 4>hunting elk we would get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>were like,</v>

560
00:23:53.901 --> 00:23:58.901
<v Speaker 4>we'd hike in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we might hike in like eight or nine </v>

561
00:23:58.901 --> 00:23:59.810
<v Speaker 4>miles somewhere to hunt and hanukkah </v>
<v Speaker 4>days and come back out.</v>

562
00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:05.500
<v Speaker 4>And then we get into,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in the truck and drive to a gas station,</v>

563
00:24:05.691 --> 00:24:08.300
<v Speaker 4>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And you go in to get like a fountain pop</v>

564
00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:14.320
<v Speaker 4>and pop that soda for you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we're not living in the fountain,</v>

565
00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:19.730
<v Speaker 4>the pot belly washer.</v>

566
00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000
<v Speaker 4>So,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but by that point in time you'd pull up </v>

567
00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:25.250
<v Speaker 4>and open the door and couldn't get out </v>
<v Speaker 4>of the vehicle.</v>

568
00:24:26.050 --> 00:24:31.050
<v Speaker 4>Like just that 20 minute drive and like </v>
<v Speaker 4>my legs would just seize up so bad that </v>

569
00:24:32.841 --> 00:24:35.660
<v Speaker 4>it would take days to recover from it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

570
00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:37.610
<v Speaker 4>And then now I don't understand like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

571
00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:43.440
<v Speaker 4>it just like doesn't have that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even if I didn't go and do that for a </v>

572
00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:44.300
<v Speaker 4>year,</v>
<v Speaker 4>maybe not a year.</v>

573
00:24:44.301 --> 00:24:45.950
<v Speaker 4>If I didn't go do that for six months or</v>
<v Speaker 4>something,</v>

574
00:24:45.951 --> 00:24:50.951
<v Speaker 4>I feel like I would just be fine.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you want me to like something like </v>

575
00:24:50.951 --> 00:24:54.970
<v Speaker 4>goes away or comms or breaks or heels or</v>
<v Speaker 4>something from just like those long </v>

576
00:24:56.570 --> 00:24:58.120
<v Speaker 4>arduous hikes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

577
00:24:59.090 --> 00:24:59.240
<v Speaker 4>it</v>

578
00:24:59.910 --> 00:25:02.610
<v Speaker 5>is incredibly adaptable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean there's things that people do.</v>

579
00:25:02.611 --> 00:25:07.611
<v Speaker 5>If you go to a martial arts school and </v>
<v Speaker 5>watch guys who have been doing jujitsu </v>

580
00:25:07.611 --> 00:25:08.880
<v Speaker 5>their whole lives and watch,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like how you can move your body around,</v>

581
00:25:08.881 --> 00:25:11.730
<v Speaker 5>how you can manipulate your body.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The only way you could do that as if you</v>

582
00:25:11.731 --> 00:25:16.731
<v Speaker 5>just do it for years and years and years</v>
<v Speaker 5>and years and you're hiking up those </v>

583
00:25:16.731 --> 00:25:21.290
<v Speaker 5>crazy slippery slopes like all those </v>
<v Speaker 5>places we hiked up were really slippery.</v>

584
00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.960
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it takes like a specific kind of balance</v>

585
00:25:24.961 --> 00:25:29.961
<v Speaker 5>and a leg endurance when you're moving </v>
<v Speaker 5>through muck and stuff and you're just.</v>

586
00:25:31.060 --> 00:25:32.460
<v Speaker 5>It's a skill,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

587
00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.020
<v Speaker 5>you're just really good at it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

588
00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.970
<v Speaker 5>You were barely getting tired.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was crazy.</v>

589
00:25:35.971 --> 00:25:37.650
<v Speaker 5>I was really impressed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>

590
00:25:37.651 --> 00:25:42.651
<v Speaker 5>this guy is barely breathing heavy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like we get to the top and he's like </v>

591
00:25:42.651 --> 00:25:42.651
<v Speaker 5>glassing and I'm going,</v>

592
00:25:44.010 --> 00:25:45.760
<v Speaker 4>he's barely breathing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at the same time,</v>

593
00:25:45.761 --> 00:25:47.110
<v Speaker 4>keep in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I live in fear of.</v>

594
00:25:47.111 --> 00:25:49.240
<v Speaker 4>I'm catching a direct hit from a two </v>
<v Speaker 4>year old.</v>

595
00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:52.590
<v Speaker 4>He gets big time out for that and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

596
00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:55.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm kind of cover my face.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like I can't take a hit from him.</v>

597
00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:58.170
<v Speaker 4>He's 35 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's a big one.</v>

598
00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:01.600
<v Speaker 4>Take one was matchbox cars and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>bought into deals me a blow to the cheek</v>

599
00:26:01.601 --> 00:26:05.160
<v Speaker 4>or something like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It puts me out why kids can.</v>

600
00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:07.630
<v Speaker 4>They can hit you hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't pull.</v>

601
00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:10.660
<v Speaker 4>My daughter decided to take her healing </v>
<v Speaker 4>to me.</v>

602
00:26:10.661 --> 00:26:13.480
<v Speaker 4>She went,</v>
<v Speaker 4>she jumped on me.</v>

603
00:26:13.481 --> 00:26:18.481
<v Speaker 4>I was lying in bed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>She jumped on me and started riding and </v>

604
00:26:18.481 --> 00:26:20.851
<v Speaker 4>she took her heel and my rib and I went </v>
<v Speaker 4>crazy.</v>

605
00:26:21.461 --> 00:26:22.820
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how'd you get that much power,</v>

606
00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:25.060
<v Speaker 4>that heel strike.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you teach them martial arts yet?</v>

607
00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.860
<v Speaker 4>Not yet.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My son will definitely be learning.</v>

608
00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.950
<v Speaker 5>Train tHem when the role in the four </v>
<v Speaker 5>year old and two year old,</v>

609
00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:31.930
<v Speaker 5>because they wrestle around together </v>
<v Speaker 5>naturally,</v>

610
00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:34.270
<v Speaker 5>so I trained them positions and I was </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

611
00:26:34.271 --> 00:26:36.970
<v Speaker 5>thIs is not what you want to stay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're in this position when you want</v>

612
00:26:36.971 --> 00:26:37.700
<v Speaker 5>to do you a to.</v>

613
00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:41.340
<v Speaker 4>That's it's important to teach somebody </v>
<v Speaker 4>how to do that.</v>

614
00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:43.380
<v Speaker 4>Like my wife today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>honest,</v>

615
00:26:43.410 --> 00:26:44.910
<v Speaker 4>honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 4>my wait like two hours ago,</v>

616
00:26:44.911 --> 00:26:49.911
<v Speaker 4>my wife sent me a message on my phone </v>
<v Speaker 4>asking if I thought that our little boy </v>

617
00:26:49.911 --> 00:26:49.911
<v Speaker 4>would</v>

618
00:26:49.911 --> 00:26:53.040
<v Speaker 1>like a karate classes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really good.</v>

619
00:26:53.041 --> 00:26:56.460
<v Speaker 1>I never did anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of hunting,</v>

620
00:26:56.490 --> 00:27:01.490
<v Speaker 1>known a lot of physical things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think men need a lot of physical </v>

621
00:27:01.490 --> 00:27:04.671
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think the idea that a man that it's </v>

622
00:27:04.671 --> 00:27:07.551
<v Speaker 1>natural for man to have no explosive </v>
<v Speaker 1>release physically for the rest of his </v>

623
00:27:08.251 --> 00:27:13.251
<v Speaker 1>life and just sit in a cubicle and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>go through life with shiny shoes on the </v>

624
00:27:13.251 --> 00:27:15.620
<v Speaker 1>fucking tiMe your body's going to break.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's This total.</v>

625
00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:19.350
<v Speaker 1>That's a totally unnatural thing you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>asking of it and if you don't,</v>

626
00:27:19.351 --> 00:27:24.351
<v Speaker 1>you don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have some sort of physical release </v>

627
00:27:24.351 --> 00:27:24.351
<v Speaker 1>or at least understand how to manage it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

628
00:27:24.351 --> 00:27:26.500
<v Speaker 1>you got to understand how to manage it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like managing it.</v>

629
00:27:26.501 --> 00:27:28.140
<v Speaker 1>It's super important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

630
00:27:28.141 --> 00:27:33.141
<v Speaker 1>it also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also hormonally for a man doing </v>

631
00:27:33.141 --> 00:27:34.590
<v Speaker 1>exercise like that hormone changes </v>
<v Speaker 1>hormonally when you don't,</v>

632
00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:36.900
<v Speaker 1>when you don't exercise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you lose it,</v>

633
00:27:36.901 --> 00:27:37.140
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

634
00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:39.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh no question.</v>

635
00:27:39.930 --> 00:27:44.930
<v Speaker 1>No question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Way healthier to actually lifting heavy </v>

636
00:27:44.930 --> 00:27:46.450
<v Speaker 1>is a good thing too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about for little kids,</v>

637
00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:50.160
<v Speaker 1>the little kids like learning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like learning how to do difficult things</v>

638
00:27:50.161 --> 00:27:55.161
<v Speaker 1>like early on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So important because well think how </v>

639
00:27:55.161 --> 00:27:59.631
<v Speaker 1>normal it is for you to like sleep </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere that's fucking cold as shit </v>

640
00:27:59.631 --> 00:27:59.660
<v Speaker 1>with a sleeping bag and like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

641
00:27:59.670 --> 00:28:01.560
<v Speaker 1>well this is what we're doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we are.</v>

642
00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:03.510
<v Speaker 1>You and moe curled up together in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>van,</v>

643
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:06.870
<v Speaker 1>freezing your ass off that for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for an average person,</v>

644
00:28:06.871 --> 00:28:11.871
<v Speaker 1>that's like some walking dead type shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That scenario never comes up and if it </v>

645
00:28:11.971 --> 00:28:14.460
<v Speaker 1>did that they would fall apart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't be able to deal with it.</v>

646
00:28:14.461 --> 00:28:16.080
<v Speaker 1>They'd be complaining and whining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

647
00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:17.790
<v Speaker 1>how many people would complain and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whine?</v>

648
00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:20.250
<v Speaker 1>Well steve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shed some light on this because I've</v>

649
00:28:20.251 --> 00:28:25.251
<v Speaker 1>read accounts of where the settlers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when they would move west and they'd </v>

650
00:28:25.251 --> 00:28:29.591
<v Speaker 1>come in contact with native americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be a barely cold winter or </v>

651
00:28:29.591 --> 00:28:32.481
<v Speaker 1>something and they would see like native</v>
<v Speaker 1>americans and children who's not not </v>

652
00:28:35.911 --> 00:28:39.660
<v Speaker 1>dressed warmly dressed in like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

653
00:28:39.661 --> 00:28:41.390
<v Speaker 1>or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or not warmly compared to west.</v>

654
00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.270
<v Speaker 1>So they'd be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be like,</v>

655
00:28:42.470 --> 00:28:47.470
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 degrees out or something and they'd </v>

656
00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:47.470
<v Speaker 1>be in two skins and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

657
00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:50.730
<v Speaker 1>but not nearly as bundled up as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would expect tHem to be.</v>

658
00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:51.850
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think that.</v>

659
00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:56.930
<v Speaker 4>I think the people,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think the people acclimate to that </v>

660
00:28:56.930 --> 00:28:59.361
<v Speaker 4>kind of stuff and you see your own minor</v>
<v Speaker 4>version of it just like the way you </v>

661
00:28:59.361 --> 00:29:01.680
<v Speaker 4>might behave throughout the winter.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do you know what I mean?</v>

662
00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:04.100
<v Speaker 4>Like you get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you get just general,</v>

663
00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:09.130
<v Speaker 4>you cost them to It to all of the year </v>
<v Speaker 4>and then you see like mild variations </v>

664
00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:11.970
<v Speaker 4>where people who might grow up at </v>
<v Speaker 4>northern latitudes moved down south.</v>

665
00:29:12.030 --> 00:29:14.760
<v Speaker 4>They come back home and can't hack the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cold,</v>

666
00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:16.060
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I wonder what that is maybe.</v>

667
00:29:16.061 --> 00:29:19.470
<v Speaker 4>And maybe your body naturally starts </v>
<v Speaker 4>preparing for that are heating up.</v>

668
00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:21.360
<v Speaker 4>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make something shifts and then he looked</v>

669
00:29:21.361 --> 00:29:23.900
<v Speaker 4>like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Even then if you look at cultures like,</v>

670
00:29:23.901 --> 00:29:25.600
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like inuit cultures,</v>

671
00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:29.640
<v Speaker 4>I mean just in that small amount of time</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's not like a relatively.</v>

672
00:29:29.641 --> 00:29:34.641
<v Speaker 4>that's not a very ancient,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's not a very ancient people are </v>

673
00:29:34.641 --> 00:29:37.791
<v Speaker 4>very ancient culture but they're fairly </v>
<v Speaker 4>new arrivals in the arctic but they </v>

674
00:29:37.791 --> 00:29:41.901
<v Speaker 4>already like demonstrate physical </v>
<v Speaker 4>differences and physical adaptations </v>

675
00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:43.870
<v Speaker 4>that would help them adapt to the cold.</v>

676
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:45.940
<v Speaker 4>Like how much,</v>
<v Speaker 4>how much stuff you spread out,</v>

677
00:29:46.090 --> 00:29:51.090
<v Speaker 4>like how much blood you send to your </v>
<v Speaker 4>extremities and how well you can shut </v>

678
00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:53.620
<v Speaker 4>that off and control it either.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Another thing is there's this thing,</v>

679
00:29:53.870 --> 00:29:58.050
<v Speaker 4>it's called the bergman principle a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's a principle in,</v>

680
00:29:58.060 --> 00:30:02.350
<v Speaker 4>in while in while they physiology and </v>
<v Speaker 4>the bergman principle holds that like if</v>

681
00:30:02.351 --> 00:30:03.480
<v Speaker 4>you have a species,</v>
<v Speaker 4>okay,</v>

682
00:30:03.570 --> 00:30:08.570
<v Speaker 4>like let's take white tail deer in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>southern extreme of that species range.</v>

683
00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:14.170
<v Speaker 4>The Animals are going to be much smaller</v>
<v Speaker 4>than in the northern extreme.</v>

684
00:30:14.171 --> 00:30:16.240
<v Speaker 4>So if you look at white tail deer from </v>
<v Speaker 4>alberta,</v>

685
00:30:16.241 --> 00:30:21.241
<v Speaker 4>they're just monsters up there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's the eyes to get lIke 280 pound </v>

686
00:30:21.241 --> 00:30:21.790
<v Speaker 4>deer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>whatever down in the southern extreme of</v>

687
00:30:21.791 --> 00:30:25.060
<v Speaker 4>their range.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They might weigh 90 pounds and what they</v>

688
00:30:25.061 --> 00:30:30.061
<v Speaker 4>find is that a bigger,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like generally a bigger animal has less </v>

689
00:30:30.251 --> 00:30:35.251
<v Speaker 4>surface area so that bigger animals </v>
<v Speaker 4>better able to retain body heat in a </v>

690
00:30:35.771 --> 00:30:38.710
<v Speaker 4>smaller animal and a man will shape a </v>
<v Speaker 4>smaller animal,</v>

691
00:30:38.711 --> 00:30:42.820
<v Speaker 4>has a greater surface area and Is thus </v>
<v Speaker 4>better able to shed heat.</v>

692
00:30:42.820 --> 00:30:45.040
<v Speaker 4>So it comes down to hear shouting and </v>
<v Speaker 4>heat retention.</v>

693
00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:46.990
<v Speaker 4>And when you look at like human </v>
<v Speaker 4>cultures,</v>

694
00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:48.370
<v Speaker 4>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so a smaller animal,</v>

695
00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:52.240
<v Speaker 4>say again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a bigger animal.</v>

696
00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:58.410
<v Speaker 4>If you have it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>let's say you have exactly the same </v>

697
00:30:58.410 --> 00:30:58.410
<v Speaker 4>shape dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay?</v>

698
00:30:58.410 --> 00:31:01.090
<v Speaker 4>But one of those dogs is 200 pounds and </v>
<v Speaker 4>one of those dogs is 50 pounds,</v>

699
00:31:01.091 --> 00:31:05.470
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The larger dog has less surface area per</v>

700
00:31:05.471 --> 00:31:10.471
<v Speaker 4>unit of mass and suicide in the smaller </v>
<v Speaker 4>dog has greater surface area per unit of</v>

701
00:31:10.541 --> 00:31:15.541
<v Speaker 4>mass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so that's a way In which animals </v>

702
00:31:15.541 --> 00:31:15.541
<v Speaker 4>help,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

703
00:31:15.541 --> 00:31:18.930
<v Speaker 4>shedding heat and keeping it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And another thing you see in species </v>

704
00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:19.060
<v Speaker 4>like now that we look at the wooly </v>
<v Speaker 4>mammoths,</v>

705
00:31:19.061 --> 00:31:20.710
<v Speaker 4>the wooly mammoth,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that very small ears,</v>

706
00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:21.940
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we think of elephants,</v>

707
00:31:21.941 --> 00:31:24.040
<v Speaker 4>I haven't really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Elephant tine giant ears,</v>

708
00:31:24.041 --> 00:31:25.480
<v Speaker 4>the woolly mammoth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It various small hears.</v>

709
00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.730
<v Speaker 4>It was the arctic and subarctic </v>
<v Speaker 4>inhabitant.</v>

710
00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:31.780
<v Speaker 4>Then you look at like the african </v>
<v Speaker 4>element in near ecuadorian zones,</v>

711
00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:36.960
<v Speaker 4>big ears.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like the ability to sheD heat </v>

712
00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.730
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to send a bunch of blood into that big </v>

713
00:31:39.730 --> 00:31:41.880
<v Speaker 4>year and drop that heat on it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What I'm saying is not just the body </v>

714
00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:42.790
<v Speaker 4>size thing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but just like attributes,</v>

715
00:31:42.791 --> 00:31:44.050
<v Speaker 4>long legs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

716
00:31:44.051 --> 00:31:47.350
<v Speaker 4>things that long legs would help you </v>
<v Speaker 4>shed he squat legs,</v>

717
00:31:47.351 --> 00:31:49.750
<v Speaker 4>he'll be retaining.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So when you look at human cultures,</v>

718
00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:54.840
<v Speaker 4>like human cultures from ecuadorian </v>
<v Speaker 4>areas in human cultures from arctic and </v>

719
00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:58.591
<v Speaker 4>subarctic areas will in some way </v>
<v Speaker 4>demonstrate that same tendency of have </v>

720
00:31:58.591 --> 00:32:01.960
<v Speaker 4>that same physiology of being squat and </v>
<v Speaker 4>compact,</v>

721
00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:04.720
<v Speaker 4>being able to handle cold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I think that,</v>

722
00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:07.690
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it doesn't take that long for.</v>

723
00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:09.840
<v Speaker 4>I mean whatever your feelings are about </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

724
00:32:09.850 --> 00:32:14.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when I talk about evolution dies just </v>

725
00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:14.850
<v Speaker 4>like tangled up,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

726
00:32:14.850 --> 00:32:18.210
<v Speaker 4>people think you're making some </v>
<v Speaker 4>grandiose comment about religion or the </v>

727
00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:18.210
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I'm just going to like,</v>

728
00:32:18.210 --> 00:32:19.340
<v Speaker 4>the things are different,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

729
00:32:19.570 --> 00:32:22.480
<v Speaker 4>things look different where they come </v>
<v Speaker 4>from and it doesn't end.</v>

730
00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:27.510
<v Speaker 4>I think thAt it goes pretty quick.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And in species and humans and stuff </v>

731
00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:30.130
<v Speaker 4>making,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

732
00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:34.340
<v Speaker 4>like acquiring adaptations that help </v>
<v Speaker 4>them deal with climates.</v>

733
00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:37.390
<v Speaker 4>And you talked about guys going out </v>
<v Speaker 4>west.</v>

734
00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:40.520
<v Speaker 4>I mean like settlers going west,</v>
<v Speaker 4>who is going to wind up thriving,</v>

735
00:32:40.540 --> 00:32:45.540
<v Speaker 4>the guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're gonna have to call the guy who </v>

736
00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:45.540
<v Speaker 4>can sleep out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

737
00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:45.540
<v Speaker 4>that's what I think like on an </v>
<v Speaker 4>individual level.</v>

738
00:32:45.540 --> 00:32:50.220
<v Speaker 4>I think so much of it comes down to I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>getting comfortable with discomfort and </v>

739
00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:53.770
<v Speaker 4>that was something I learned,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

740
00:32:53.771 --> 00:32:56.020
<v Speaker 4>that was something I learned over a long</v>
<v Speaker 4>time of,</v>

741
00:32:56.021 --> 00:32:59.610
<v Speaker 4>of like hunting in the west and hunting </v>
<v Speaker 4>Alaska was just kinda like the,</v>

742
00:32:59.611 --> 00:33:02.140
<v Speaker 4>the mental attribute of getting </v>
<v Speaker 4>comfortable with discomfort.</v>

743
00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:03.240
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well they,</v>

744
00:33:03.241 --> 00:33:05.350
<v Speaker 1>they said that the seal teams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

745
00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:08.720
<v Speaker 1>they tried to figure out what prototype </v>
<v Speaker 1>would do well in the,</v>

746
00:33:08.730 --> 00:33:10.380
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a stocky guy or whatever.</v>

747
00:33:10.381 --> 00:33:12.600
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys are stuck here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of guys were wrestlers.</v>

748
00:33:12.601 --> 00:33:14.190
<v Speaker 1>There are three sports they recruited </v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

749
00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:16.020
<v Speaker 1>believe it or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cross swimming,</v>

750
00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:19.050
<v Speaker 1>a wrestling and one other football's on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But,</v>

751
00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:24.120
<v Speaker 1>but they couldn't actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've never been able to really </v>

752
00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:27.200
<v Speaker 1>pinpoint who makes it and why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they certainly can't even do it </v>

753
00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:31.460
<v Speaker 1>physically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like some guys just defy the odds and </v>

754
00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:31.460
<v Speaker 1>they shouldn't do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they do.</v>

755
00:33:31.460 --> 00:33:33.450
<v Speaker 1>So there's no like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that guy has this,</v>

756
00:33:33.650 --> 00:33:34.200
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these,</v>

757
00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:39.530
<v Speaker 1>these six qualities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's definitely gonna make it through </v>

758
00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:39.530
<v Speaker 1>buds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

759
00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:42.090
<v Speaker 1>it's just a very difficult thing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pinpoint why would have been talking.</v>

760
00:33:42.150 --> 00:33:47.150
<v Speaker 1>A cam cam just walked in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We only have one extra mic here,</v>

761
00:33:47.191 --> 00:33:49.680
<v Speaker 1>so you guys are going to have to close </v>
<v Speaker 1>to each other and talk.</v>

762
00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:50.280
<v Speaker 1>Are you,</v>

781
00:34:28.211 --> 00:34:28.880
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

782
00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:33.900
<v Speaker 7>the mma week that we're developing for </v>
<v Speaker 7>cam and comedy coming up last week in </v>

783
00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:37.711
<v Speaker 7>april.</v>

<v Speaker 7>Randy couture is gonna be joining us.</v>

785
00:34:38.531 --> 00:34:39.970
<v Speaker 7>We're going to talk about,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

786
00:34:39.971 --> 00:34:40.380
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

787
00:34:40.381 --> 00:34:40.810
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the.</v>

788
00:34:40.930 --> 00:34:45.930
<v Speaker 7>I think a lot of the similarities in the</v>
<v Speaker 7>crossover between the mma world and the </v>

789
00:34:45.941 --> 00:34:47.650
<v Speaker 7>world of hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

790
00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:49.810
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you talk about what,</v>

791
00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:52.540
<v Speaker 7>what attributes it takes to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

792
00:34:52.541 --> 00:34:57.541
<v Speaker 7>make it as a navy seal and he talked </v>
<v Speaker 7>about what attributes it takes two to </v>

793
00:34:57.541 --> 00:34:58.380
<v Speaker 7>make it as a hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You know,</v>

794
00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:03.390
<v Speaker 7>I think that there's all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 7>commonalities there when we talk about </v>

795
00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:07.420
<v Speaker 7>what it means to actually be better than</v>
<v Speaker 7>what we are and to grow ourselves,</v>

796
00:35:07.421 --> 00:35:08.740
<v Speaker 7>whether it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

797
00:35:08.741 --> 00:35:09.280
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>

798
00:35:09.281 --> 00:35:10.260
<v Speaker 7>the,</v>
<v Speaker 7>putting yourself in that,</v>

799
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:13.480
<v Speaker 7>that state of discomfort,</v>
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>

800
00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:14.590
<v Speaker 7>where,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

801
00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:16.090
<v Speaker 7>a lot of people bug out.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

802
00:35:16.091 --> 00:35:21.091
<v Speaker 7>they don't want to do that anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We live in a world in which our entire </v>

803
00:35:21.091 --> 00:35:22.900
<v Speaker 7>existence is based on how comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 7>can we be.</v>

804
00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:25.090
<v Speaker 7>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>again,</v>

805
00:35:25.091 --> 00:35:30.091
<v Speaker 7>you don't,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you don't become better unless you're </v>

806
00:35:30.091 --> 00:35:30.190
<v Speaker 7>pushing yourself unless you're,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you're breaking out of that comfort.</v>

807
00:35:30.730 --> 00:35:35.730
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a sad thing to see a whole </v>

808
00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:37.050
<v Speaker 1>generation of kids growing up that don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>experience that as young men.</v>

809
00:35:37.290 --> 00:35:39.780
<v Speaker 1>They don't hAve difficult tasks to </v>
<v Speaker 1>perform.</v>

810
00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:44.110
<v Speaker 1>And I think that's a critical aspect of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like your,</v>

811
00:35:44.130 --> 00:35:47.040
<v Speaker 1>your behavior and your character and </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing your character.</v>

812
00:35:47.430 --> 00:35:48.540
<v Speaker 1>You gotta fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gotta,</v>

813
00:35:48.541 --> 00:35:53.541
<v Speaker 1>you gotta be pushed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to get to a situation where you </v>

814
00:35:53.541 --> 00:35:56.610
<v Speaker 1>pass your limits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you surprised yourself with new </v>

815
00:35:56.610 --> 00:35:56.850
<v Speaker 1>limits and you changed your own </v>
<v Speaker 1>definition of yourself.</v>

816
00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:00.900
<v Speaker 1>But if you don't test yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't get into bad positions,</v>

817
00:36:00.901 --> 00:36:03.090
<v Speaker 1>you're always gonna have that weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>insecurity about yet.</v>

818
00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:06.720
<v Speaker 1>Like that weird insecurity that guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>have that have never been in any kind of</v>

819
00:36:06.721 --> 00:36:08.400
<v Speaker 1>conflict ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

820
00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:13.460
<v Speaker 1>know how they would react.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are certain people I know exactly </v>

821
00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:14.070
<v Speaker 1>how they would react if the shit hits </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fan,</v>

822
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:15.310
<v Speaker 1>but those other people.</v>

823
00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:15.840
<v Speaker 1>But like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

824
00:36:15.841 --> 00:36:17.690
<v Speaker 1>you squirly bitch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she might fall apart on me.</v>

825
00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:19.730
<v Speaker 1>Like you always say to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

826
00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:20.970
<v Speaker 1>if you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are,</v>

827
00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.710
<v Speaker 1>if you're trying to be really good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything,</v>

828
00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:28.160
<v Speaker 1>you can find all those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although you can find all that </v>

829
00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:31.131
<v Speaker 1>discomfort and all those plateaus and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything just in trying to get great </v>

830
00:36:31.131 --> 00:36:34.440
<v Speaker 1>at the guitar or whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a certain amount of humility and</v>

831
00:36:34.610 --> 00:36:39.610
<v Speaker 1>an understanding of what's really going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on that you develop when you sort of </v>

832
00:36:39.610 --> 00:36:41.970
<v Speaker 1>make any strides in any really difficult</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing or if it's playing chess,</v>

833
00:36:41.971 --> 00:36:42.660
<v Speaker 1>whether it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

834
00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:44.640
<v Speaker 1>whether it's writing know whatever it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

835
00:36:44.641 --> 00:36:49.641
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a matter of doing something </v>

836
00:36:49.641 --> 00:36:49.641
<v Speaker 1>difficult and testing your boundaries</v>

837
00:36:49.641 --> 00:36:52.680
<v Speaker 4>time all that time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All that came more naturally.</v>

838
00:36:52.681 --> 00:36:57.510
<v Speaker 4>I think if you just look at the way </v>
<v Speaker 4>people's lives used to be structured,</v>

839
00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:00.030
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in even just,</v>

840
00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:02.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not even 100 years ago or so.</v>

841
00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:06.840
<v Speaker 4>It wasn't like we Had to manufacturer </v>
<v Speaker 4>opportunities for stress.</v>

842
00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:09.870
<v Speaker 4>I mean it was just like you had things </v>
<v Speaker 4>you had to do,</v>

843
00:37:09.871 --> 00:37:11.770
<v Speaker 4>like you had to clear land or,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or,</v>

844
00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:16.050
<v Speaker 4>or people would actually have children </v>
<v Speaker 4>because they needed the additional re.</v>

845
00:37:16.070 --> 00:37:18.480
<v Speaker 4>They didn't look at children as being a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a deficit.</v>

846
00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:23.990
<v Speaker 4>They looked at children as being like an</v>
<v Speaker 4>addition of resource resource to have </v>

847
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.660
<v Speaker 4>kids because they'll help me do more </v>
<v Speaker 4>work.</v>

848
00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:29.750
<v Speaker 4>I'll have kids so that I can pump money </v>
<v Speaker 4>into them and pump resources into them.</v>

849
00:37:29.751 --> 00:37:34.230
<v Speaker 4>I'll derive from them and now I find I </v>
<v Speaker 4>certainly don't live that way now.</v>

850
00:37:34.231 --> 00:37:39.231
<v Speaker 4>I find that I manufacturer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I try to like in small dosages </v>

851
00:37:39.231 --> 00:37:43.731
<v Speaker 4>manufactured that feeling for my kid to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to like give him this.</v>

852
00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:50.360
<v Speaker 4>He doesn't see it as artificial,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but given this artificial sense of him </v>

853
00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:53.841
<v Speaker 4>having to have output that I'm doing </v>
<v Speaker 4>something and maybe I'm doing something </v>

854
00:37:53.841 --> 00:37:58.761
<v Speaker 4>completely unnecessary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like he wants to make a birdhouse so </v>

855
00:37:58.761 --> 00:38:01.691
<v Speaker 4>we're going to make a birdhouse,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but at a point it becomes just like </v>

856
00:38:01.691 --> 00:38:01.691
<v Speaker 4>arduous,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

857
00:38:01.691 --> 00:38:05.631
<v Speaker 4>there's a part where the fun dies and </v>
<v Speaker 4>now we just got to get it finished and </v>

858
00:38:06.211 --> 00:38:07.260
<v Speaker 4>to make it and to turn it in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>LIke,</v>

859
00:38:07.261 --> 00:38:07.860
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're doing this,</v>

860
00:38:07.861 --> 00:38:08.730
<v Speaker 4>we're doing this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're doing this.</v>

861
00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:14.000
<v Speaker 4>And it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I don't care if it's enjoyable to </v>

862
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:14.000
<v Speaker 4>him anymore and he's so little.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is all just like experiment now.</v>

863
00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.970
<v Speaker 4>We're just trying to like create that </v>
<v Speaker 4>sense of that you have to now in some </v>

864
00:38:18.970 --> 00:38:21.070
<v Speaker 4>way do something you don't want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

865
00:38:21.370 --> 00:38:22.590
<v Speaker 4>That is his is.</v>

866
00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:27.530
<v Speaker 1>That's part of life practice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

867
00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:29.290
<v Speaker 1>It's a part of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

868
00:38:29.590 --> 00:38:34.590
<v Speaker 1>you get,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you start getting good at soMething and </v>

869
00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:34.590
<v Speaker 1>just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

870
00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:34.590
<v Speaker 1>if you're Trying to be a good wrestler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>

871
00:38:34.590 --> 00:38:35.290
<v Speaker 1>There are days you walk in and you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

872
00:38:35.291 --> 00:38:36.940
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to wrestle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do anY of this.</v>

873
00:38:36.941 --> 00:38:39.340
<v Speaker 1>I don't even care about this anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all a bore.</v>

874
00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:41.440
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't like that guy.</v>

875
00:38:41.441 --> 00:38:45.850
<v Speaker 1>I don't like any of this and you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like getting into a cold bath until</v>

876
00:38:45.851 --> 00:38:47.310
<v Speaker 1>your skin gets acclimated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

877
00:38:47.311 --> 00:38:47.870
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's,</v>

878
00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:53.040
<v Speaker 1>that's a huge part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was like didn't really interesting </v>

879
00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:53.050
<v Speaker 1>thing that where they put it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get comfortable with discomfort.</v>

880
00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:56.320
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you can get good at </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything unless you,</v>

881
00:38:56.850 --> 00:39:01.850
<v Speaker 1>you'd get you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get comfortable with this because </v>

882
00:39:01.850 --> 00:39:01.850
<v Speaker 1>one of the things about wrestlers that </v>
<v Speaker 1>separates them from,</v>

883
00:39:01.850 --> 00:39:06.810
<v Speaker 1>in my opinion than almost every other </v>
<v Speaker 1>athlete wrestlers go through such </v>

884
00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:11.310
<v Speaker 1>horrendous stress throughout high school</v>
<v Speaker 1>between sucking wade and the training </v>

885
00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:17.970
<v Speaker 1>rustling is the most brutal fucking </v>
<v Speaker 1>training you can do and then you're </v>

886
00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:18.880
<v Speaker 1>doing strength and conditioning or hill </v>
<v Speaker 1>sprints,</v>

887
00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:20.170
<v Speaker 1>whatever kind of crazy.</v>

888
00:39:20.170 --> 00:39:21.370
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weight lifted program,</v>

889
00:39:21.371 --> 00:39:24.730
<v Speaker 1>they have you on your,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are broken down all day,</v>

890
00:39:24.731 --> 00:39:28.000
<v Speaker 1>falling asleep in class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're dehydrated,</v>

891
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:30.340
<v Speaker 1>you're sucking way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're eating fucking Turkey,</v>

892
00:39:30.341 --> 00:39:32.880
<v Speaker 1>breast and lettuce with lemon juice on </v>
<v Speaker 1>it like you,</v>

893
00:39:33.090 --> 00:39:35.950

<v Speaker 1>lifestyle.</v>

894
00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:40.180
<v Speaker 1>And these guYs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they developed this unbelievable ability</v>

895
00:39:40.181 --> 00:39:45.181
<v Speaker 1>to just grind through shit and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>break a lot of fighters just with their </v>

896
00:39:45.181 --> 00:39:47.070
<v Speaker 1>sheer will because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

897
00:39:47.130 --> 00:39:50.320
<v Speaker 1>that the mentality that comes with being</v>
<v Speaker 1>a successful wrestler.</v>

898
00:39:50.321 --> 00:39:51.070
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>A lot of people want man thoughts back.</v>

905
00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:06.910
<v Speaker 1>He used to be called man thoughts and </v>

<v Speaker 1>calender.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody.</v>

<v Speaker 1>it's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

912
00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:17.050
<v Speaker 1>people look for the brian cowen </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcasts,</v>

913
00:40:17.051 --> 00:40:19.910
<v Speaker 1>they're not going to google manto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>

914
00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:23.380
<v Speaker 1>There's a little disconnect there with </v>
<v Speaker 1>people finding it.</v>

915
00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:26.630
<v Speaker 1>It was an idea to but can't do any on so</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad labeling.</v>

916
00:40:26.650 --> 00:40:31.650
<v Speaker 1>It was the first modern rousey ronda </v>
<v Speaker 1>rousey because the ufc champion and I'm </v>

917
00:40:31.650 --> 00:40:35.120
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The point is I'm making is that I think </v>

918
00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:35.120
<v Speaker 1>part of what makes her so great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She was an olympian in judo,</v>

919
00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:39.840
<v Speaker 1>which is so difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That same kind of training and when you </v>

920
00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:41.950
<v Speaker 1>get into you get into the octagon with </v>
<v Speaker 1>ronda rousey man.</v>

921
00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:44.420
<v Speaker 1>She's been through the muck.</v>

<v Speaker 5>We slept when the lights went out.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Basically we ate,</v>

1037
00:46:08.351 --> 00:46:10.240
<v Speaker 5>slept and.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But getting up,</v>

1038
00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:13.050
<v Speaker 5>it didn't seem that hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>it was.</v>

1039
00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:14.860
<v Speaker 5>It was really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was probably because we were going to</v>

1040
00:46:14.861 --> 00:46:15.910
<v Speaker 5>bed at eight and wake up.</v>

1041
00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:19.070
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I did get about 14 hours of sleep.</v>

1042
00:46:20.090 --> 00:46:22.130
<v Speaker 2>I didn't even need a nap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm rugged.</v>

1043
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.720
<v Speaker 2>It was hard</v>

1044
00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:27.740
<v Speaker 5>to figure out how to sleep at first,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I realized eventually that the </v>

1045
00:46:27.740 --> 00:46:30.120
<v Speaker 5>softest way to do it is to keep your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your not just your sleeping bag,</v>

1046
00:46:30.121 --> 00:46:32.430
<v Speaker 5>but your jacket on as well.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Let me get all my clothes,</v>

1047
00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:37.290
<v Speaker 5>all my clothes on my jacket and my </v>
<v Speaker 5>sleeping bag and the down jacket and the</v>

1048
00:46:37.291 --> 00:46:39.300
<v Speaker 5>sleeping bag was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>this is just enough.</v>

1049
00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.250
<v Speaker 5>Let me tell you something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>the next time we go hunting,</v>

1050
00:46:41.251 --> 00:46:46.251
<v Speaker 5>I'm bringing a sherpa and guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 5>He's going to carry a big fucking </v>

1051
00:46:46.251 --> 00:46:46.251
<v Speaker 5>mattress on it.</v>

1052
00:46:46.251 --> 00:46:46.700
<v Speaker 2>Back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Portable Heater.</v>

1053
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:51.790
<v Speaker 2>And fuck you guys by the portable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to fucking matches with a big </v>

1054
00:46:52.431 --> 00:46:57.431
<v Speaker 2>pillow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember we passed that one will lose </v>

1055
00:46:57.431 --> 00:46:57.431
<v Speaker 2>something though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>man.</v>

1056
00:46:57.431 --> 00:47:00.760
<v Speaker 2>Whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What dId we just talked about?</v>

1057
00:47:00.850 --> 00:47:01.260
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>

1058
00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:01.600
<v Speaker 2>Sorry,</v>

1059
00:47:04.190 --> 00:47:07.130
<v Speaker 4>he's a famous quote,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't remember who said like,</v>

1060
00:47:07.131 --> 00:47:08.990
<v Speaker 4>you don't really know a man,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1061
00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:10.210
<v Speaker 4>100,</v>
<v Speaker 4>100 with them.</v>

1062
00:47:10.430 --> 00:47:12.380
<v Speaker 4>I wish I forget that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know the guy,</v>

1063
00:47:12.381 --> 00:47:15.440
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what he said or who said it</v>
<v Speaker 4>was really destroys my point.</v>

1064
00:47:15.441 --> 00:47:18.900
<v Speaker 4>But broadly I was and say is it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's like a.</v>

1065
00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:22.340
<v Speaker 4>I was talking to one time with the older</v>
<v Speaker 4>friend of mine,</v>

1066
00:47:22.341 --> 00:47:27.341
<v Speaker 4>he was talking about being at his </v>
<v Speaker 4>fishing camp and he was trying to </v>

1067
00:47:27.341 --> 00:47:29.921
<v Speaker 4>describe why he likes to be known as </v>
<v Speaker 4>fishing camp with his buddies now is </v>

1068
00:47:29.921 --> 00:47:31.150
<v Speaker 4>fish held and Alaska and he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everyone's just so,</v>

1069
00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:34.630
<v Speaker 4>so competent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1070
00:47:35.070 --> 00:47:38.470
<v Speaker 4>and it wound up being like that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He just kind of appreciated that.</v>

1071
00:47:38.471 --> 00:47:43.471
<v Speaker 4>Like hanging out with people who like </v>
<v Speaker 4>have the ability to just to take care of</v>

1072
00:47:43.481 --> 00:47:46.180
<v Speaker 4>things,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like to do things.</v>

1073
00:47:46.181 --> 00:47:51.181
<v Speaker 4>And he was saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you gotta wait in line if you want to </v>

1074
00:47:51.181 --> 00:47:51.181
<v Speaker 4>wash a dish,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1075
00:47:51.181 --> 00:47:51.340
<v Speaker 4>with this crew of people who's out with.</v>

1076
00:47:51.600 --> 00:47:53.200
<v Speaker 4>And I think that in ways,</v>
<v Speaker 4>none of this thing,</v>

1077
00:47:53.201 --> 00:47:54.420
<v Speaker 4>this is exclusive to hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1078
00:47:54.421 --> 00:47:55.120
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there was many things,</v>

1079
00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:57.070
<v Speaker 4>but it's like going on a trip,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1080
00:47:57.220 --> 00:48:00.430
<v Speaker 4>going on a trip with people where things</v>
<v Speaker 4>aren't so great all the time.</v>

1081
00:48:00.431 --> 00:48:05.431
<v Speaker 4>LIke there's,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's elements of being cold was </v>

1082
00:48:05.431 --> 00:48:07.381
<v Speaker 4>elements of having not slept enough,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's kind of having this feeling of </v>

1083
00:48:07.381 --> 00:48:08.580
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>everything's gonna be okay.</v>

1084
00:48:08.590 --> 00:48:13.590
<v Speaker 4>like these guys are like great people to</v>
<v Speaker 4>be with and they're just really </v>

1085
00:48:13.590 --> 00:48:14.830
<v Speaker 4>competent people and right now we're </v>
<v Speaker 4>doing those behind like we're doing like</v>

1086
00:48:14.831 --> 00:48:19.831
<v Speaker 4>this little crew show on like the media.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was just on the one that's coming up </v>

1087
00:48:19.831 --> 00:48:22.150
<v Speaker 4>or kind of about the guys I work with.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And when I watched it I kind of see that</v>

1088
00:48:22.151 --> 00:48:27.151
<v Speaker 4>where I just feel.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm like comfortable being around </v>

1089
00:48:27.151 --> 00:48:28.840
<v Speaker 4>people that I've spent a lot of time out</v>
<v Speaker 4>hunting with.</v>

1090
00:48:28.841 --> 00:48:29.620
<v Speaker 4>And again,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't want to make.</v>

1091
00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:32.230
<v Speaker 4>I tHink that sports teams feel something</v>
<v Speaker 4>similar.</v>

1092
00:48:32.550 --> 00:48:37.550
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think there's guys served together in </v>

1093
00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:37.690
<v Speaker 4>the military,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it just kind of a way of,</v>

1094
00:48:37.691 --> 00:48:42.691
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>being away from things and sort of </v>

1095
00:48:42.691 --> 00:48:43.600
<v Speaker 4>relying on other structures,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1096
00:48:43.870 --> 00:48:48.870
<v Speaker 4>relyIng on other things and not having </v>
<v Speaker 4>assumptions about people holding their </v>

1097
00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:49.420
<v Speaker 4>weight or if you could complain,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make it funny.</v>

1098
00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:49.880
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

1099
00:48:50.170 --> 00:48:51.550
<v Speaker 3>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's right.</v>

1100
00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:56.670
<v Speaker 3>You know that when I went spent 11 days </v>
<v Speaker 3>in Afghanistan doing the uso tour and </v>

1101
00:48:56.670 --> 00:48:57.450
<v Speaker 3>one of the things I came away with was </v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

1102
00:48:57.730 --> 00:48:59.350
<v Speaker 3>I realized I went,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

1103
00:48:59.351 --> 00:49:04.351
<v Speaker 3>I've been in la for a long time where </v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the center of my own universe and </v>

1104
00:49:04.351 --> 00:49:04.351
<v Speaker 3>everybody around me is always about </v>
<v Speaker 3>them.</v>

1105
00:49:04.351 --> 00:49:07.450
<v Speaker 3>And one of the thingS i founD very </v>
<v Speaker 3>refreshing about being in a war zone,</v>

1106
00:49:07.451 --> 00:49:09.290
<v Speaker 3>if there is such a thing as being </v>
<v Speaker 3>professional,</v>

1107
00:49:09.291 --> 00:49:12.340
<v Speaker 3>is that when you're in the military,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you're a marine,</v>

1108
00:49:12.341 --> 00:49:14.080
<v Speaker 3>you're an army guy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you come last,</v>

1109
00:49:14.140 --> 00:49:16.930
<v Speaker 3>those guys put themselves last and </v>
<v Speaker 3>everybody around them comes first.</v>

1110
00:49:16.931 --> 00:49:20.170
<v Speaker 3>So when you get off a bus and you're </v>
<v Speaker 3>unloading bags,</v>

1111
00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:23.770
<v Speaker 3>there's always a line of people </v>
<v Speaker 3>unloading everybody else's bags.</v>

1112
00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:27.040
<v Speaker 3>Everybody's looking out for the other </v>
<v Speaker 3>guy next to him.</v>

1113
00:49:27.370 --> 00:49:30.380
<v Speaker 3>and that's that ethos that is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is quito in,</v>

1114
00:49:30.381 --> 00:49:31.550
<v Speaker 3>in the military,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's,</v>

1115
00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:32.740
<v Speaker 3>that's drummed in you.</v>

1116
00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:35.320
<v Speaker 3>And I got to say that having come from </v>
<v Speaker 3>la,</v>

1117
00:49:35.321 --> 00:49:38.110
<v Speaker 3>which was the exact opposite of being </v>
<v Speaker 3>thrown into that experience,</v>

1118
00:49:38.111 --> 00:49:39.460
<v Speaker 3>was very,</v>
<v Speaker 3>very kind of.</v>

1119
00:49:39.790 --> 00:49:42.070
<v Speaker 3>It was really.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't expect it.</v>

1120
00:49:42.071 --> 00:49:44.410
<v Speaker 3>It was just one of the most ridiculous </v>
<v Speaker 3>places to live in the world.</v>

1121
00:49:44.490 --> 00:49:49.490
<v Speaker 3>If you wanna,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you want to find like actual real </v>

1122
00:49:49.490 --> 00:49:50.200
<v Speaker 3>humans to talk to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>real,</v>

1123
00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:51.400
<v Speaker 3>real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>authentic.</v>

1124
00:49:51.401 --> 00:49:54.310
<v Speaker 3>It's true authenticity and loss and with</v>
<v Speaker 3>men and women,</v>

1125
00:49:54.460 --> 00:49:59.460
<v Speaker 3>it's like it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's such a brutal grind to try to find </v>

1126
00:49:59.460 --> 00:49:59.460
<v Speaker 3>people that are your friends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you can talk to.</v>

1127
00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:02.100
<v Speaker 3>I've cultivated a group over the years </v>
<v Speaker 3>and I'm.</v>

1128
00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:07.230
<v Speaker 3>One of the things about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>about doing your show is that I knew </v>

1129
00:50:07.230 --> 00:50:08.050
<v Speaker 3>that if I was going to do it and I </v>
<v Speaker 3>brought this motherfucker around,</v>

1130
00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:10.450
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>will change the whole tone of the show.</v>

1131
00:50:10.451 --> 00:50:12.520
<v Speaker 3>Like this show is just going to be a </v>
<v Speaker 3>five day silly,</v>

1132
00:50:12.560 --> 00:50:12.970
<v Speaker 3>fast.</v>

1133
00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:15.940
<v Speaker 3>This is the perfect thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because.</v>

1134
00:50:16.210 --> 00:50:19.540
<v Speaker 3>And also I knew that brian cowen holds </v>
<v Speaker 3>up a new.</v>

1135
00:50:19.541 --> 00:50:24.541
<v Speaker 3>No matter what happened,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they fucking asteroids can become and </v>

1136
00:50:24.541 --> 00:50:24.541
<v Speaker 3>that we'd be looking at each other.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well pal,</v>

1137
00:50:24.541 --> 00:50:28.861
<v Speaker 3>it's been a good time,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I don't see us survive in that </v>

1138
00:50:28.861 --> 00:50:28.861
<v Speaker 3>fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm always ready to go out with a bang.</v>

1139
00:50:28.861 --> 00:50:33.730
<v Speaker 3>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I will stand by your side no matter </v>

1140
00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:33.730
<v Speaker 3>what.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's how I think of friendship.</v>

1141
00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:36.000
<v Speaker 3>He's my four in the morning.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I got a body to get rid of guy.</v>

1142
00:50:36.090 --> 00:50:38.500
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's true.</v>

1143
00:50:38.570 --> 00:50:40.940
<v Speaker 3>If I had,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I had a guy that I had to call up and</v>

1144
00:50:40.941 --> 00:50:41.540
<v Speaker 3>go,</v>

<v Speaker 3>You know I.</v>

00:55:49.991 --> 00:55:54.991
<v Speaker 3>Like when we were like brian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when we got back when we were on the </v>

1265
00:55:54.991 --> 00:55:54.991
<v Speaker 3>boat and you were like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh my god,</v>

1266
00:55:54.991 --> 00:55:58.980
<v Speaker 3>that's the last day of being on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>water was so fucking cold.</v>

1267
00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:04.000
<v Speaker 3>My god,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't even notice because steve kept </v>

1268
00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.541
<v Speaker 3>telling me all these cool ass fucking </v>
<v Speaker 3>indian stories about how this guy got </v>

1269
00:56:06.541 --> 00:56:09.880
<v Speaker 3>away and this guy hitting a beaver's dan</v>
<v Speaker 3>and this guy,</v>

1270
00:56:09.881 --> 00:56:12.940
<v Speaker 3>they told him he could run naked.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can try to get away if you can,</v>

1271
00:56:12.970 --> 00:56:17.080
<v Speaker 3>if you can run away,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and so I was so frozen and I saw you and</v>

1272
00:56:17.110 --> 00:56:22.110
<v Speaker 3>it was so cold that you had like there </v>
<v Speaker 3>were icicles out of your beard and you </v>

1273
00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:22.110
<v Speaker 3>were just smiling the whole time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>

1274
00:56:22.110 --> 00:56:23.080
<v Speaker 3>how is he not cold?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

1275
00:56:23.290 --> 00:56:24.040
<v Speaker 3>So you did your</v>

1276
00:56:24.040 --> 00:56:25.210
<v Speaker 4>job,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you distract them.</v>

1277
00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:26.560
<v Speaker 4>I was enjoying myself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1278
00:56:26.561 --> 00:56:31.561
<v Speaker 4>I never bothered.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean knowing that the cold was only </v>

1279
00:56:31.561 --> 00:56:31.561
<v Speaker 4>like a five day thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was like,</v>

1280
00:56:31.561 --> 00:56:36.361
<v Speaker 4>as long as it's only a five day thing </v>
<v Speaker 4>and when we were walking around in the </v>

1281
00:56:36.361 --> 00:56:36.361
<v Speaker 4>day,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it wasn't bad.</v>

1282
00:56:36.361 --> 00:56:38.020
<v Speaker 4>As long as you have gloves on,</v>
<v Speaker 4>even if you're.</v>

1283
00:56:38.021 --> 00:56:40.120
<v Speaker 4>If you're done upright,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you're wearing the right shit,</v>

1284
00:56:40.121 --> 00:56:42.230
<v Speaker 4>it's not a bad deal.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's.</v>

1285
00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:43.130
<v Speaker 4>The thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like a,</v>

1286
00:56:43.150 --> 00:56:48.150
<v Speaker 4>it's like a paradox almost where when </v>
<v Speaker 4>you get uncomfortable and cold like </v>

1287
00:56:48.150 --> 00:56:50.690
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>some part he wants you to stand there,</v>

1288
00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:56.440
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but the only time you're actually </v>

1289
00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:56.440
<v Speaker 4>comfortable is when you're out screwing </v>
<v Speaker 4>around.</v>

1290
00:56:56.440 --> 00:57:00.780
<v Speaker 4>YeAh.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You got to move around as soon as you </v>

1291
00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:00.780
<v Speaker 4>start moving around,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's something intimate.</v>

1292
00:57:00.780 --> 00:57:02.530
<v Speaker 4>You stop,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something comes something and habits you</v>

1293
00:57:02.531 --> 00:57:05.110
<v Speaker 4>in and makes you want to just like stand</v>
<v Speaker 4>there,</v>

1294
00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:08.580
<v Speaker 4>be cold and it's like the guys that are </v>
<v Speaker 4>good about it are the guys that just,</v>

1295
00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:13.620
<v Speaker 4>you look and instead of hanging around </v>
<v Speaker 4>and talk and there was like walking up </v>

1296
00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:14.590
<v Speaker 4>and down a little hill and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>totally fine.</v>

1297
00:57:14.620 --> 00:57:16.660
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's weird how comfortable we got sweaty</v>

1298
00:57:17.050 --> 00:57:18.900
<v Speaker 4>even though it's like nine degrees out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>

1299
00:57:19.060 --> 00:57:21.580
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of times we're fucking </v>
<v Speaker 4>sweaty,</v>

1300
00:57:21.581 --> 00:57:23.780
<v Speaker 4>moving around a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's why kills,</v>

1301
00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:24.270
<v Speaker 4>right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1302
00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:25.960
<v Speaker 4>when you get sweat needs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you've got to have wool.</v>

1303
00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:31.260
<v Speaker 4>The opposite of that is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>are you familiar with paradoxical </v>

1304
00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:31.530
<v Speaker 4>paradoxical undressing?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like when people,</v>

1305
00:57:31.531 --> 00:57:36.420
<v Speaker 4>a free fine hypothermia like victims </v>
<v Speaker 4>will hypothermia that they'll.</v>

1306
00:57:36.450 --> 00:57:41.450
<v Speaker 4>They'll often have often shed their </v>
<v Speaker 4>clothes but an erratic ways taking </v>

1307
00:57:41.450 --> 00:57:45.210
<v Speaker 4>jewelry off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm taking one sock off,</v>

1308
00:57:45.211 --> 00:57:48.900
<v Speaker 4>but there's this thing that happens </v>
<v Speaker 4>where you spend like your body.</v>

1309
00:57:49.020 --> 00:57:51.540
<v Speaker 4>When you start getting cold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>your body spends a lot of energy.</v>

1310
00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:57.870
<v Speaker 4>It constricts certain blood vessels and </v>
<v Speaker 4>stops the flow of blood out to your </v>

1311
00:57:59.311 --> 00:58:01.060
<v Speaker 4>extremities,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to the tip of your nose.</v>

1312
00:58:01.061 --> 00:58:06.061
<v Speaker 4>You know when you get cold,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like tip of your nose will get kind of </v>

1313
00:58:06.061 --> 00:58:06.061
<v Speaker 4>numb in white is your fingers get that </v>
<v Speaker 4>way,</v>

1314
00:58:06.061 --> 00:58:09.720
<v Speaker 4>like your body's working really hard to </v>
<v Speaker 4>to stave off the heat loss so it doesn't</v>

1315
00:58:09.721 --> 00:58:12.270
<v Speaker 4>want to send as much blood out to places</v>
<v Speaker 4>that lose blood easily,</v>

1316
00:58:13.350 --> 00:58:17.070
<v Speaker 4>but as you tire and you start to peter </v>
<v Speaker 4>out,</v>

1317
00:58:17.970 --> 00:58:22.970
<v Speaker 4>that gives way your body can't expend </v>
<v Speaker 4>the energy necessary to do that and it </v>

1318
00:58:22.970 --> 00:58:26.280
<v Speaker 4>opens those up and it's a rush of heat,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so it's like your.</v>

1319
00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:29.130
<v Speaker 4>Your fingers have gotten very cold.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Your lives have gotten very cold.</v>

1320
00:58:29.131 --> 00:58:31.180
<v Speaker 4>Your face got very cold and all of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>sudden you body's like,</v>

1321
00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:36.300
<v Speaker 4>I can't do anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And all that hot blood rushes out to </v>

1322
00:58:36.300 --> 00:58:36.690
<v Speaker 4>those things and people apparently get </v>
<v Speaker 4>this feeling of intense heat.</v>

1323
00:58:37.050 --> 00:58:38.400
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Grunden start.</v>

1324
00:58:38.550 --> 00:58:43.550
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then so they'll find someone and </v>

1325
00:58:43.550 --> 00:58:43.550
<v Speaker 4>it's always like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1326
00:58:43.550 --> 00:58:45.510
<v Speaker 4>he's got some clothes over here and his </v>
<v Speaker 4>wedding rings land over that way and you</v>

1327
00:58:45.511 --> 00:58:48.260
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>burn.</v>

1328
00:58:49.010 --> 00:58:52.970
<v Speaker 4>But you know what man I got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I Just,</v>

1329
00:58:53.090 --> 00:58:56.090
<v Speaker 4>I was down fishing in Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got built by black flies real bad.</v>

1330
00:58:56.170 --> 00:59:01.170
<v Speaker 4>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and for the first time since I got </v>

1331
00:59:01.170 --> 00:59:02.470
<v Speaker 4>married,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I took my wedding ring off for a day and</v>

1332
00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:07.470
<v Speaker 4>a that's all good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got like a guilty conscious feeling </v>

1333
00:59:07.470 --> 00:59:12.310
<v Speaker 4>and I had to put it back on and </v>
<v Speaker 4>uncomfortable because I just felt </v>

1334
00:59:12.310 --> 00:59:15.041
<v Speaker 4>guilty.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then I get here and I'm looking </v>

1335
00:59:15.041 --> 00:59:16.961
<v Speaker 4>through my bag and find my wife's </v>
<v Speaker 4>reading wedding ring in my backpack </v>

1336
00:59:16.961 --> 00:59:18.440
<v Speaker 4>because like a week ago she didn't know </v>
<v Speaker 4>where to put it.</v>

1337
00:59:18.441 --> 00:59:20.780
<v Speaker 4>And I put my backpack on and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>do you even know</v>

1338
00:59:22.860 --> 00:59:27.860
<v Speaker 2>like here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bunch of dudes in the background come </v>

1339
00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:27.900
<v Speaker 2>back to the hot tub.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

1340
00:59:27.980 --> 00:59:32.430
<v Speaker 2>I didn't know he had a hard time trying </v>
<v Speaker 2>to scratch undermine,</v>

1341
00:59:32.470 --> 00:59:37.470
<v Speaker 2>you know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And hers is just in some unknown </v>

1342
00:59:37.470 --> 00:59:37.470
<v Speaker 2>location too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I left my,</v>

1343
00:59:37.470 --> 00:59:40.830
<v Speaker 1>I left my wedding ring at a spa where I </v>
<v Speaker 1>got a massage from a dude.</v>

1344
00:59:41.700 --> 00:59:43.530
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been getting,</v>

1345
00:59:43.531 --> 00:59:48.531
<v Speaker 1>I get messages from dudes now I gave up </v>
<v Speaker 1>because girls can't do it hard and they </v>

1346
00:59:48.531 --> 00:59:48.531
<v Speaker 1>can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need,</v>

1347
00:59:48.900 --> 00:59:50.910
<v Speaker 1>I need deep tissue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's brutal.</v>

1348
00:59:50.911 --> 00:59:52.260
<v Speaker 1>It's painful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't feel good.</v>

1349
00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:57.320
<v Speaker 1>But you got to have a man doing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because women just not strong enough to </v>

1350
00:59:57.320 --> 00:59:57.320
<v Speaker 1>do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some women are,</v>

1351
00:59:57.320 --> 01:00:00.540
<v Speaker 1>they used their elbows really well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm borderline.</v>

1352
01:00:00.590 --> 01:00:02.670
<v Speaker 1>He has to have a mustache.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Borderline violent.</v>

1353
01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:04.050
<v Speaker 1>It's that hard to come with a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

1354
01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:05.700
<v Speaker 1>It's not that hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

1355
01:00:05.701 --> 01:00:06.810
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>

1356
01:00:06.811 --> 01:00:07.310
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>

1357
01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:12.400
<v Speaker 1>I go and I come back and she always </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes fun of me for getting massaged by </v>

1358
01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:12.400
<v Speaker 1>dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

1359
01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:12.990
<v Speaker 1>And then I go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck,</v>

1360
01:00:12.991 --> 01:00:15.330
<v Speaker 1>I left my wedding ring there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I run back,</v>

1361
01:00:15.630 --> 01:00:17.520
<v Speaker 1>I get the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when I come back home she goes,</v>

1362
01:00:17.521 --> 01:00:18.390
<v Speaker 1>was it in his ass?</v>

1363

<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

1364
01:00:25.341 --> 01:00:26.990
<v Speaker 2>It was fucking hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

<v Speaker 2>mouth and see what that was.</v>

<v Speaker 2>I mean like alex,</v>

1377
01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:57.780
<v Speaker 2>what's your next?</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's your next trip?</v>

1378
01:00:57.781 --> 01:01:02.310
<v Speaker 2>How do you talk about the constitution?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How weird is this?</v>

1379
01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:03.390
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is.</v>

1380
01:01:04.290 --> 01:01:05.480
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's death squad team.</v>

1381
01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:08.280
<v Speaker 2>That's hilarious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Did you just transfer it?</v>

1382
01:01:08.310 --> 01:01:12.390
<v Speaker 2>I bought that during the commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's good move man.</v>

1383
01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:17.480
<v Speaker 2>That's a smart move.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how much does something like that </v>

1384
01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:17.480
<v Speaker 2>costs?</v>
<v Speaker 2>13 bucks.</v>

1385
01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:18.000
<v Speaker 2>Because I used to keep our code rogan </v>
<v Speaker 2>and save 10 percent.</v>

1386
01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:20.670
<v Speaker 2>Guys,</v>

<v Speaker 1>of that shows on a regular basis.</v>

<v Speaker 1>You'll show if you get skunkeD,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know.</v>

<v Speaker 1>He'll have a whole episode.</v>

1398
01:01:45.181 --> 01:01:50.070
<v Speaker 1>Like there was an episode where you were</v>
<v Speaker 1>going after our dad wasn't that one.</v>

1399
01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:52.950
<v Speaker 1>You got so close but it was too Dark for</v>
<v Speaker 1>you to like,</v>

1400
01:01:53.130 --> 01:01:55.140
<v Speaker 2>we've done four.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've done for skunk.</v>

1401
01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:59.750
<v Speaker 2>You can't get nothing getting skunked </v>
<v Speaker 2>like.</v>

1402
01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:00.190
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

1403
01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:00.690
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

1404
01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:04.210
<v Speaker 2>skunk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The skunk is not getting anything.</v>

1405
01:02:04.810 --> 01:02:08.950
<v Speaker 2>The first time we filmed a dunker I'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>stop using that lingo.</v>

1406
01:02:08.951 --> 01:02:11.350
<v Speaker 2>the first time I will hunt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

1407
01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:16.680
<v Speaker 2>um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was very nervous and I was trying to </v>

1408
01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:16.680
<v Speaker 2>make the case.</v>

1409
01:02:16.680 --> 01:02:17.860
<v Speaker 6>We uh,</v>
<v Speaker 6>wouldn't air it.</v>

1410
01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:20.340
<v Speaker 4>I don't know know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seems stupid.</v>

1411
01:02:20.341 --> 01:02:21.840
<v Speaker 4>We're at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it seemed like a good idea.</v>

1412
01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:24.810
<v Speaker 4>We wouldn't air it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And then one time we went out,</v>

1413
01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:29.840
<v Speaker 4>we went to hunter mountain lions with </v>
<v Speaker 4>hounds with a friend of mine and went </v>

1414
01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:31.410
<v Speaker 4>and spent six days hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't get anything,</v>

1415
01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:34.440
<v Speaker 4>came back,</v>
<v Speaker 4>went back out again,</v>

1416
01:02:35.030 --> 01:02:37.770
<v Speaker 4>been I think seven days hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>didn't get anything.</v>

1417
01:02:37.771 --> 01:02:42.771
<v Speaker 4>And at that point we just had it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So then we cut that into one and </v>

1418
01:02:42.771 --> 01:02:44.820
<v Speaker 4>oftentimes the winds up being that I'm </v>
<v Speaker 4>not oftentimes,</v>

1419
01:02:44.821 --> 01:02:48.510
<v Speaker 4>it's almost like the normal way is </v>
<v Speaker 4>people will then pick those out as their</v>

1420
01:02:48.511 --> 01:02:50.310
<v Speaker 4>favorite shows.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Really.</v>

1421
01:02:50.610 --> 01:02:52.590
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and I think it gets back to that thing I</v>

1422
01:02:52.591 --> 01:02:54.390
<v Speaker 4>was talking about earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like is um,</v>

1423
01:02:55.530 --> 01:02:58.290
<v Speaker 4>is that whole thing of like courting </v>
<v Speaker 4>uncertainty.</v>

1424
01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.180
<v Speaker 4>do you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And like,</v>

1425
01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:02.640
<v Speaker 4>like things that are challenging and </v>
<v Speaker 4>things you won't figure it out.</v>

1426
01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:04.650
<v Speaker 4>So I think people like to see that </v>
<v Speaker 4>represented.</v>

1427
01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:08.370
<v Speaker 4>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll say that there's a big rift in um,</v>

1428
01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:14.750
<v Speaker 4>in hunting as experienced by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>american sportsman in hunting as seen on</v>

1429
01:03:18.090 --> 01:03:19.800
<v Speaker 4>hunting television.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>

1430
01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.200
<v Speaker 4>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>growing up,</v>

1431
01:03:22.201 --> 01:03:25.560
<v Speaker 4>like we were start hunting deer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Bowl on october one and you can hunt</v>

1432
01:03:25.561 --> 01:03:30.561
<v Speaker 4>deer right up almost the rifle season,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which was November 15th and you had 10 </v>

1433
01:03:30.561 --> 01:03:33.861
<v Speaker 4>days to hunt with a rifle.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then you'd pick your bow bAckup and the </v>

1434
01:03:33.861 --> 01:03:37.080
<v Speaker 4>hunted December 31st and it would be </v>
<v Speaker 4>plausible that you would hunt pretty </v>

1435
01:03:37.381 --> 01:03:40.470
<v Speaker 4>hard through that whole thing and never </v>
<v Speaker 4>get a deer.</v>

1436
01:03:41.460 --> 01:03:43.020
<v Speaker 4>It was just the thing that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man.</v>

1437
01:03:43.021 --> 01:03:43.960
<v Speaker 4>You would like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1438
01:03:43.961 --> 01:03:45.020
<v Speaker 4>most years you get deer,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it'd be,</v>

1439
01:03:45.210 --> 01:03:47.750
<v Speaker 4>you might not.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And there's a lot of guys were not there</v>

1440
01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:48.600
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's Turkey season.</v>

1441
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:53.870
<v Speaker 4>There's a lot of guys around in this </v>
<v Speaker 4>country facing the prospect that they </v>

1442
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:53.870
<v Speaker 4>work pretty hard and haunted five,</v>
<v Speaker 4>six,</v>

1443
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:55.770
<v Speaker 4>seven days and they won't get a Turkey.</v>

1444
01:03:55.950 --> 01:03:57.390
<v Speaker 4>So I think that people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>

1445
01:03:57.630 --> 01:04:02.630
<v Speaker 4>and I think that the assumption is </v>
<v Speaker 4>always that people do want to Get </v>

1446
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:04.920
<v Speaker 4>something and they do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so when they're watching something,</v>

1447
01:04:04.921 --> 01:04:07.560
<v Speaker 4>like when they're watching television,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's a form of escapism.</v>

1448
01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:12.540
<v Speaker 4>And so you want to see people achieve </v>
<v Speaker 4>what you wish you achieved,</v>

1449
01:04:12.660 --> 01:04:17.660
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there would be a thing that you'd </v>

1450
01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:17.660
<v Speaker 4>want to go and see,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I dream of killing a big buck.</v>

1451
01:04:17.660 --> 01:04:19.260
<v Speaker 4>I want to watch a guy shoot 10 bIg </v>
<v Speaker 4>bucks,</v>

1452
01:04:19.830 --> 01:04:24.830
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>and that's like one form of </v>

1453
01:04:24.830 --> 01:04:24.830
<v Speaker 4>entertainment.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think at the same time,</v>

1454
01:04:24.830 --> 01:04:27.330
<v Speaker 4>people like to see in some way their </v>
<v Speaker 4>life reflected back to them.</v>

1455
01:04:28.410 --> 01:04:33.410
<v Speaker 7>I think more and more people actually </v>
<v Speaker 7>are going the route that you just </v>

1456
01:04:33.410 --> 01:04:33.410
<v Speaker 7>described.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They wAnt to see that,</v>

1457
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:38.510
<v Speaker 7>that authentic experience,</v>
<v Speaker 7>especially because a lot of reality tv </v>

1458
01:04:38.510 --> 01:04:40.500
<v Speaker 7>now is very unrealistic.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's very safe.</v>

1459
01:04:40.650 --> 01:04:42.290
<v Speaker 7>You got to pull up my.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Sorry.</v>

1460
01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:45.690
<v Speaker 7>It's so hard.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But a lot of reality tv right now,</v>

1461
01:04:45.691 --> 01:04:48.250
<v Speaker 7>it's not really reality tv at scripted,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>

1462
01:04:48.270 --> 01:04:50.730
<v Speaker 7>And so there is something completely </v>
<v Speaker 7>unscripted,</v>

1463
01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:52.260
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's real.</v>

1464
01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:54.720
<v Speaker 7>If you're watching meat eater and you </v>
<v Speaker 7>don't get anything,</v>

1465
01:04:54.910 --> 01:04:56.850
<v Speaker 7>I think you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's a real show.</v>

1466
01:04:57.120 --> 01:05:02.120
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that really happened was it wasn't like </v>

1467
01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:02.260
<v Speaker 7>we actually got a bunch of stuff and </v>
<v Speaker 7>then it's better to just,</v>

1468
01:05:02.261 --> 01:05:03.780
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>show that sometimes you don't.</v>

1469
01:05:03.810 --> 01:05:04.760
<v Speaker 7>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But you know,</v>

1470
01:05:05.050 --> 01:05:05.970
<v Speaker 7>and that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

1471
01:05:05.971 --> 01:05:10.971
<v Speaker 7>you talked to anybody who's hunted for,</v>
<v Speaker 7>for any amount of time and a huge part </v>

1472
01:05:10.971 --> 01:05:14.400
<v Speaker 7>of the huntington is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>is about going out with the guys that,</v>

1473
01:05:14.550 --> 01:05:16.800
<v Speaker 7>that you're going hunting with and it's </v>
<v Speaker 7>about the experience.</v>

1474
01:05:16.801 --> 01:05:17.750
<v Speaker 7>It's About</v>

1475
01:05:18.170 --> 01:05:21.670
<v Speaker 8>what you bring home in terms of the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the game.</v>

1476
01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:23.990
<v Speaker 8>Whereas what you bring home up here and </v>
<v Speaker 8>in here.</v>

1477
01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:26.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think um,</v>

1478
01:05:26.180 --> 01:05:29.690
<v Speaker 1>it's important to show that you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>always get something because it's,</v>

1479
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:30.690
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're,</v>

1480
01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:33.200
<v Speaker 1>It's a real show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The everything you're doing is real,</v>

1481
01:05:33.201 --> 01:05:34.060
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's,</v>

1482
01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:36.290
<v Speaker 1>that's part of the whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got to,</v>

1483
01:05:36.380 --> 01:05:41.380
<v Speaker 1>it's got to be A part of the whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>prison presentation also lends to the </v>

1484
01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:41.380
<v Speaker 1>drama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

1485
01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:43.490
<v Speaker 1>actually when there are assumptions you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get it.</v>

1486
01:05:43.491 --> 01:05:45.800
<v Speaker 1>So now that our dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sheep one was a great one,</v>

1487
01:05:45.801 --> 01:05:50.801
<v Speaker 1>even though you didn't get one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just like seeing you like in the </v>

1488
01:05:50.801 --> 01:05:50.930
<v Speaker 1>dusk where it was just getting like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>five minutes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what kind of limits ted </v>

1521
01:07:15.421 --> 01:07:19.360

<v Speaker 1>Backyard land management issue.</v>

1522
01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:24.560
<v Speaker 1>You know where you can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can make the call if you've got a </v>

1523
01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:25.200
<v Speaker 1>high fence operation in Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like how many take out</v>

1524
01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:27.280
<v Speaker 8>you can do your do your own manager.</v>

1525
01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:28.600
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know.</v>

1526
01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:33.800
<v Speaker 1>That's management and he sitting up </v>
<v Speaker 1>there in the fucking tree stand blast </v>

1527
01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:33.800
<v Speaker 1>and deer with his bow and arrow</v>

1528
01:07:34.270 --> 01:07:39.270
<v Speaker 8>variability.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It surprises people that surprised </v>

1529
01:07:39.270 --> 01:07:42.121
<v Speaker 8>people that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that don't have familiarity with </v>

1530
01:07:42.121 --> 01:07:42.121
<v Speaker 8>hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 8>One,</v>

1531
01:07:42.121 --> 01:07:43.510
<v Speaker 8>it surprises people that there's </v>
<v Speaker 8>regulations at all sometimes like if you</v>

1532
01:07:43.511 --> 01:07:44.170
<v Speaker 8>grow up,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

1533
01:07:44.171 --> 01:07:49.171
<v Speaker 8>I,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I have friends in New York who were </v>

1534
01:07:49.171 --> 01:07:49.171
<v Speaker 8>pleasantly surprised to hear that wild </v>
<v Speaker 8>game is managed.</v>

1535
01:07:49.420 --> 01:07:50.300
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>and,</v>

1536
01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:53.380
<v Speaker 8>and I think also beyond that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's surprising to people at the very,</v>

1537
01:07:53.381 --> 01:07:55.990
<v Speaker 8>the variations from the different </v>
<v Speaker 8>states,</v>

1538
01:07:56.110 --> 01:08:01.110
<v Speaker 8>their strategy and how they're managing.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And I think a lot of it comes down to </v>

1539
01:08:01.110 --> 01:08:03.880
<v Speaker 8>what a lot of it comes down to how much </v>
<v Speaker 8>of the state's public and like Texas,</v>

1540
01:08:04.330 --> 01:08:06.850
<v Speaker 8>they even got to school,</v>
<v Speaker 8>got rid of school trust lands.</v>

1541
01:08:06.851 --> 01:08:11.851
<v Speaker 8>So like you used to be the one in every </v>
<v Speaker 8>36 sections belonged to the state and </v>

1542
01:08:11.851 --> 01:08:16.711
<v Speaker 8>they could use that to either build </v>
<v Speaker 8>schools on or use that land to fund </v>

1543
01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:22.360
<v Speaker 8>school construction and they threw </v>
<v Speaker 8>mineral leasing or timber rights or </v>

1544
01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:22.360
<v Speaker 8>whatever.</v>

1545
01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:27.150
<v Speaker 8>And at a point in Texas even scrap that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>they even sold that off into private </v>

1546
01:08:27.150 --> 01:08:27.150
<v Speaker 8>interests.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So they,</v>

1547
01:08:27.150 --> 01:08:29.660
<v Speaker 8>it's like there really is like public </v>
<v Speaker 8>trust.</v>

1548
01:08:29.661 --> 01:08:34.661
<v Speaker 8>Wildlife isn't as vital in a place like </v>
<v Speaker 8>taxes because there's not publicly owned</v>

1549
01:08:34.761 --> 01:08:37.450
<v Speaker 8>land with publicly owned wildlife on it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>

1550
01:08:37.610 --> 01:08:38.810
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's kinda crazy,</v>

1551
01:08:38.811 --> 01:08:40.690
<v Speaker 8>isn't it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that you take a state like new guys,</v>

1552
01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:45.700
<v Speaker 8>everything is privately estela you guys </v>
<v Speaker 8>that you guys have humongous national </v>

1553
01:08:45.700 --> 01:08:49.241
<v Speaker 8>forest.</v>
<v Speaker 8>There's a lot of public trust land and </v>

1554
01:08:49.241 --> 01:08:49.580
<v Speaker 8>public trust while.</v>
<v Speaker 8>But even in places like California,</v>

1555
01:08:49.581 --> 01:08:50.480
<v Speaker 8>so yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you have a,</v>

1556
01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:55.720
<v Speaker 8>you have the government plays a much </v>
<v Speaker 8>stronger hand in a much more detail </v>

1557
01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:56.210
<v Speaker 8>oriented hand.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And like,</v>

1558
01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:59.600
<v Speaker 8>what's happening,</v>
<v Speaker 8>all this stuff was our harvest like that</v>

1559
01:08:59.601 --> 01:09:01.430
<v Speaker 8>in some states where it kind of tends to</v>
<v Speaker 8>be like,</v>

1560
01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:02.180
<v Speaker 8>well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's your land,</v>

1561
01:09:02.181 --> 01:09:03.480
<v Speaker 8>you figure it out are</v>

1562
01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:08.720
<v Speaker 5>show on the mountain lions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the specific reasons I wanted to </v>

1563
01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:11.580
<v Speaker 5>bring that up is because the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the idea of hunting with hogs or hunting</v>

1564
01:09:11.581 --> 01:09:12.910
<v Speaker 5>with dogs rather is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1565
01:09:13.070 --> 01:09:15.300
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they've done work it off</v>

1566
01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:21.760
<v Speaker 2>too hard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I cannot get a mountain lion with these </v>

1567
01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:24.860
<v Speaker 2>stupid dude.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

1568
01:09:24.861 --> 01:09:26.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My iphone road hogs.</v>

1569
01:09:26.901 --> 01:09:31.901
<v Speaker 2>I meant you need trained dog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fuck man hunter.</v>

1570
01:09:32.991 --> 01:09:36.590
<v Speaker 2>I told people I'm a hunter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now look like an ass on facebook</v>

1571
01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:43.870
<v Speaker 5>dogs in California.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You can hunt with dogs anymore.</v>

1572
01:09:43.900 --> 01:09:45.490
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>

1573
01:09:45.491 --> 01:09:47.290
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>some people are concerned about that.</v>

1574
01:09:47.291 --> 01:09:52.291
<v Speaker 5>I've heard people say that they're </v>
<v Speaker 5>worried that the mountain lion </v>

1575
01:09:52.291 --> 01:09:52.291
<v Speaker 5>population is going to get too strong if</v>
<v Speaker 5>they do that.</v>

1576
01:09:52.291 --> 01:09:54.400
<v Speaker 5>Especially people have lost dogs or who </v>
<v Speaker 5>knows,</v>

1577
01:09:54.410 --> 01:09:57.610
<v Speaker 5>people who have been a fucking bikers </v>
<v Speaker 5>and shit.</v>

1578
01:09:57.611 --> 01:10:01.300
<v Speaker 5>They get taken out,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but California doesn't allow it anymore.</v>

1579
01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:05.620
<v Speaker 5>Coincidentally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw a mountain lion last week in santa</v>

1580
01:10:05.621 --> 01:10:09.070
<v Speaker 5>barbara.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A small mountain line wasn't very big.</v>

1581
01:10:09.071 --> 01:10:10.790
<v Speaker 5>I thought it was a chaotic at first </v>
<v Speaker 5>could,</v>

1582
01:10:10.970 --> 01:10:11.970
<v Speaker 5>but it wasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1583
01:10:12.010 --> 01:10:13.510
<v Speaker 5>coyotes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They move kind of stiff.</v>

1584
01:10:13.630 --> 01:10:17.250
<v Speaker 5>This thing had like this bounce to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Tail put.</v>

1585
01:10:17.370 --> 01:10:19.360
<v Speaker 5>It wasn't a bobcat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

1586
01:10:19.410 --> 01:10:21.460
<v Speaker 5>it was the tail and the long tails.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mountain lion.</v>

1587
01:10:21.461 --> 01:10:23.530
<v Speaker 5>It was probably 70 pounds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

1588
01:10:23.950 --> 01:10:24.220
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

1589
01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:25.780
<v Speaker 8>I think you're seeing like.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>

1590
01:10:25.781 --> 01:10:28.170
<v Speaker 8>and I don't mean to say I hate to,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't want to sound like,</v>

1591
01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:31.170
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like taking cheap shots,</v>

1592
01:10:31.480 --> 01:10:33.090
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>at California or anything,</v>

1593
01:10:33.091 --> 01:10:38.091
<v Speaker 8>but you're seeing a pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a real erosion of haunting.</v>

1594
01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:41.490
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like a gradual.</v>

1595
01:10:41.670 --> 01:10:46.670
<v Speaker 8>Not even grab a pretty steady of rowers.</v>
<v Speaker 8>No hunting rights in California there </v>

1596
01:10:46.670 --> 01:10:47.840
<v Speaker 8>was a debate that was easy because </v>
<v Speaker 8>there's a thing.</v>

1597
01:10:48.290 --> 01:10:52.230
<v Speaker 8>There's the thing,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I mentioned this somewhere where you can</v>

1598
01:10:52.231 --> 01:10:55.500
<v Speaker 8>go to american or you can go to the </v>
<v Speaker 8>american public and say like,</v>

1599
01:10:56.700 --> 01:10:59.190
<v Speaker 8>yes or no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like do you approve of,</v>

1600
01:10:59.490 --> 01:11:01.680
<v Speaker 8>of regulated hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

1601
01:11:02.220 --> 01:11:04.590
<v Speaker 8>And you get the vast majority of </v>
<v Speaker 8>americans.</v>

1602
01:11:04.830 --> 01:11:09.830
<v Speaker 8>It's something ridiculous.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like 74 percent or 75 percent of </v>

1603
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.830
<v Speaker 8>americans will say like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>yes,</v>

1604
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:12.840
<v Speaker 8>I approve of honey.</v>
<v Speaker 8>but then you start asking them,</v>

1605
01:11:14.470 --> 01:11:14.870
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like,</v>

1606
01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:17.440
<v Speaker 8>well how about with dogs?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right?</v>

1607
01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:23.000
<v Speaker 8>And in those numbers start to go down </v>
<v Speaker 8>when you start [inaudible] because you </v>

1608
01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.260
<v Speaker 8>can kInd of,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's easy to sell people on.</v>

1609
01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:30.260
<v Speaker 8>The idea is easy to sell.</v>
<v Speaker 8>People who've never seen a hunting dog </v>

1610
01:11:30.260 --> 01:11:31.050
<v Speaker 8>there were never had experienced with </v>
<v Speaker 8>dog.</v>

1611
01:11:31.140 --> 01:11:36.140
<v Speaker 8>I've never laid eyes on a line.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It's easy to sell them on the idea that </v>

1612
01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:37.620
<v Speaker 8>somehow there's no challenge in it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And so then you can,</v>

1613
01:11:37.650 --> 01:11:42.650
<v Speaker 8>you can have a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>a way to chip away like a way to chip </v>

1614
01:11:42.650 --> 01:11:44.700
<v Speaker 8>away at liberty,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like personal liberty and stuff.</v>

1615
01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:46.380
<v Speaker 8>it's just to do like one little thing at</v>
<v Speaker 8>a time,</v>

1616
01:11:46.940 --> 01:11:47.820
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we'll do this,</v>

1617
01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:48.600
<v Speaker 8>we'll do that,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we'll do this,</v>

1618
01:11:48.601 --> 01:11:49.920
<v Speaker 8>we'll do that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And so like,</v>

1619
01:11:50.010 --> 01:11:51.870
<v Speaker 8>They'll never be a thing like we'll ban </v>
<v Speaker 8>hunting.</v>

1620
01:11:51.910 --> 01:11:54.660
<v Speaker 8>It was be that you can't hunt on this </v>
<v Speaker 8>kind of land.</v>

1621
01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:59.720
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you can't have this kind of animal this </v>

1622
01:11:59.720 --> 01:12:01.881
<v Speaker 8>way.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Well in fact we don't want you to </v>

1623
01:12:01.881 --> 01:12:01.881
<v Speaker 8>hunting that kind of animal at all.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And you see that in certain places.</v>

1624
01:12:01.881 --> 01:12:02.640
<v Speaker 8>Colorado's had some experience with </v>
<v Speaker 8>that.</v>

1625
01:12:02.670 --> 01:12:05.090
<v Speaker 8>We know you got the lead ammo ban and </v>
<v Speaker 8>the uh,</v>

1626
01:12:05.130 --> 01:12:08.260
<v Speaker 8>California conduit range that they're </v>
<v Speaker 8>trying to expand statewide.</v>

1627
01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:10.770
<v Speaker 8>So you couldn't use lead ammo to hunt at</v>
<v Speaker 8>all.</v>

1628
01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:15.980
<v Speaker 8>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there even places where there are no </v>

1629
01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:17.271
<v Speaker 8>cars,</v>
<v Speaker 8>even the places where there are no </v>

1630
01:12:17.271 --> 01:12:17.271
<v Speaker 8>condo,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

1631
01:12:17.271 --> 01:12:19.170
<v Speaker 3>I heard a big debate about this mountain</v>
<v Speaker 3>lion issue and one of the things that </v>

1632
01:12:19.170 --> 01:12:20.820
<v Speaker 3>the guy from the fish and wildlife </v>
<v Speaker 3>service said is,</v>

1633
01:12:21.090 --> 01:12:26.090
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you guys don't realize is if you're </v>

1634
01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:27.801
<v Speaker 3>actually a preservationist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the majority of money that we collect to</v>

1635
01:12:28.021 --> 01:12:32.760
<v Speaker 3>preserve the land you like to hike in </v>
<v Speaker 3>comes from hunters.</v>

1636
01:12:33.180 --> 01:12:38.180
<v Speaker 3>It comes from Hunting licenses.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's where the fish and wildlife </v>

1637
01:12:38.180 --> 01:12:42.801
<v Speaker 3>service and these different </v>
<v Speaker 3>organizations that are responsible for </v>

1638
01:12:42.801 --> 01:12:45.000
<v Speaker 3>maintenance of the land that is hunted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hiked on and camped on.</v>

1639
01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:49.020
<v Speaker 3>That's the 90 some crazy amount of 95 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent,</v>

1640
01:12:49.021 --> 01:12:50.100
<v Speaker 3>some crazy amount.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can't remember.</v>

1641
01:12:50.101 --> 01:12:55.101
<v Speaker 3>The percentage comes from hunters and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the dues and fees they have to pay to </v>

1642
01:12:55.411 --> 01:13:00.411
<v Speaker 3>hunt that land.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I think that the debate has to be </v>

1643
01:13:00.411 --> 01:13:04.101
<v Speaker 3>couched in those terms too.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you really wanted to get rid of </v>

1644
01:13:04.101 --> 01:13:06.831
<v Speaker 3>hunters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we wouldn't have revenue to actually </v>

1645
01:13:06.831 --> 01:13:06.831
<v Speaker 3>maintain.</v>

1646
01:13:06.831 --> 01:13:10.750
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think there's also this part need to </v>

1647
01:13:10.750 --> 01:13:12.941
<v Speaker 5>appease a certain liberal said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm part of the population that is very </v>

1648
01:13:13.371 --> 01:13:18.371
<v Speaker 5>uncomfortable with hunting in the first </v>
<v Speaker 5>place and would like to look at people </v>

1649
01:13:18.371 --> 01:13:18.470
<v Speaker 5>hunting with dogs as okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>jesus christ,</v>

1650
01:13:18.471 --> 01:13:23.471
<v Speaker 5>that's part ferric.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Your sicking dogs on them and then </v>

1651
01:13:23.471 --> 01:13:23.471
<v Speaker 5>you're shooting them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's poor defenseless animals,</v>

1652
01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:29.620
<v Speaker 5>especially when it comes to predators.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a population management issue </v>

1653
01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:31.160
<v Speaker 5>that they're not willing to address and </v>
<v Speaker 5>if you don't address that,</v>

1654
01:13:31.370 --> 01:13:32.750
<v Speaker 5>you're going to deal with it in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>suburbs.</v>

1655
01:13:32.751 --> 01:13:37.751
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They just shot a fucking mountain lion </v>

1656
01:13:37.751 --> 01:13:37.751
<v Speaker 5>with a tranquilizer dart in glendale the</v>
<v Speaker 5>other day.</v>

1657
01:13:37.751 --> 01:13:39.470
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Was all in the news and they killed that</v>

1658
01:13:39.471 --> 01:13:42.650
<v Speaker 5>one in santa monica a year ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That was 90 fucking pounds.</v>

1659
01:13:42.770 --> 01:13:44.450
<v Speaker 5>I saw one in santa barbara the other </v>
<v Speaker 5>day.</v>

1660
01:13:44.690 --> 01:13:49.690
<v Speaker 5>I mean it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not comfortable like with those </v>

1661
01:13:49.690 --> 01:13:49.690
<v Speaker 5>things like getting more popular.</v>

1662
01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:51.110
<v Speaker 8>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm never,</v>

1663
01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:56.590
<v Speaker 8>I'm never comfortable with terms like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like overpopulated because it's just </v>

1664
01:13:56.590 --> 01:13:58.250
<v Speaker 8>like.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't know really how to define it,</v>

1665
01:13:58.251 --> 01:14:03.251
<v Speaker 8>but overpopulating the sense that you're</v>
<v Speaker 8>gonna wind up seeing impacts that might </v>

1666
01:14:03.251 --> 01:14:06.050
<v Speaker 8>be counter to what it is you're going </v>
<v Speaker 8>after.</v>

1667
01:14:06.410 --> 01:14:09.860
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like you'll lose in infringe Areas.</v>

1668
01:14:09.890 --> 01:14:12.340
<v Speaker 8>You might lose species</v>

1669
01:14:12.790 --> 01:14:17.790
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>
<v Speaker 4>to predation and predation have a </v>

1670
01:14:17.790 --> 01:14:17.790
<v Speaker 4>serious effect on species that you may </v>
<v Speaker 4>be.</v>

1671
01:14:17.790 --> 01:14:21.721
<v Speaker 4>We'll want back at what happened with </v>
<v Speaker 4>wolves in yellowstone is not what is </v>

1672
01:14:21.721 --> 01:14:24.640
<v Speaker 4>happening or you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you seem like a radical,</v>

1673
01:14:24.641 --> 01:14:28.120
<v Speaker 4>radical decline.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Radical,</v>

1674
01:14:28.600 --> 01:14:33.370
<v Speaker 4>very localized decline.</v>
<v Speaker 4>An elk and moose.</v>

1675
01:14:33.670 --> 01:14:37.120
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and it's hard for people.</v>

1676
01:14:37.210 --> 01:14:42.210
<v Speaker 4>If you look at a map of the country and </v>
<v Speaker 4>what used to be wolf territory and at </v>

1677
01:14:42.210 --> 01:14:44.860
<v Speaker 4>the time of european contact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was wolf country,</v>

1678
01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:50.100
<v Speaker 4>the country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the entire nation was in some way or </v>

1679
01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:50.100
<v Speaker 4>another had had wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>not the entire place,</v>

1680
01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:54.361
<v Speaker 4>but a lot of adults.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now let's say you're a guy and you live </v>

1681
01:14:54.361 --> 01:14:55.840
<v Speaker 4>in Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All right,</v>

1682
01:14:57.660 --> 01:14:59.560
<v Speaker 4>and you hear that hunting wolves,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Montana.</v>

1683
01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:04.860
<v Speaker 4>You're probably thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but we don't even have wolves in </v>

1684
01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:04.860
<v Speaker 4>Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We do,</v>

1685
01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:05.200
<v Speaker 4>but there's not many.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's kind of controversial.</v>

1686
01:15:05.201 --> 01:15:07.000
<v Speaker 4>Whether it is a stable breeding </v>
<v Speaker 4>population or not.</v>

1687
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:09.790
<v Speaker 4>And you're telling me that they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>killing them right up in Montana because</v>

1688
01:15:09.791 --> 01:15:14.791
<v Speaker 4>it's hard for people to visualize the </v>
<v Speaker 4>localized impact of these things so you </v>

1689
01:15:15.641 --> 01:15:20.641
<v Speaker 4>can have too many wolves in Montana and </v>
<v Speaker 4>then jump down through Wyoming and you </v>

1690
01:15:21.690 --> 01:15:24.400
<v Speaker 4>enter Colorado and you could have not </v>
<v Speaker 4>enough.</v>

1691
01:15:24.850 --> 01:15:27.370
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why is that the wolves?</v>

1692
01:15:27.490 --> 01:15:29.440
<v Speaker 4>I guess they stay within a certain </v>
<v Speaker 4>territory.</v>

1693
01:15:29.490 --> 01:15:31.690
<v Speaker 4>They stay within a certain territory and</v>
<v Speaker 4>they have a really.</v>

1694
01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:33.640
<v Speaker 4>I mean they have a profound effect and </v>
<v Speaker 4>stuff.</v>

1695
01:15:33.790 --> 01:15:38.790
<v Speaker 4>You have To think like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>have you guys been to yellowstone </v>

1696
01:15:38.790 --> 01:15:39.040
<v Speaker 4>national park kid?</v>
<v Speaker 4>You also national park,</v>

1697
01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:44.060
<v Speaker 4>you know the last,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like yellowstone national park was </v>

1698
01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:44.060
<v Speaker 4>hunted for,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1699
01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:44.290
<v Speaker 4>nine or 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>years.</v>

1700
01:15:44.291 --> 01:15:49.291
<v Speaker 4>I think the oldest artifact,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they found that they have reliable data </v>

1701
01:15:49.291 --> 01:15:49.900
<v Speaker 4>from yellowstone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>something like a spear point from 9,000</v>

1702
01:15:49.901 --> 01:15:52.540
<v Speaker 4>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it hasn't those joe's,</v>

1703
01:15:53.230 --> 01:15:54.250
<v Speaker 4>but the last one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>hundred years,</v>

1704
01:15:54.251 --> 01:15:54.850
<v Speaker 4>no one's hunted it.</v>

1705
01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:58.210
<v Speaker 4>Yellowstone park,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when he also parked became a park.</v>

1706
01:15:58.270 --> 01:16:03.270
<v Speaker 4>There was still an indian war,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like the nez perce went through there </v>

1707
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.520
<v Speaker 4>and killed some tourists while they are </v>
<v Speaker 4>fleeing the u.</v>

1708
01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:04.620
<v Speaker 4>S military.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

1709
01:16:05.230 --> 01:16:07.030
<v Speaker 4>After that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they banned hunting yellowstone national</v>

1710
01:16:07.031 --> 01:16:12.031
<v Speaker 4>park.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Anyone who goes to yellowstone national </v>

1711
01:16:12.031 --> 01:16:12.040
<v Speaker 4>park now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we'll see the way the elk and everything</v>

1712
01:16:12.041 --> 01:16:14.420
<v Speaker 4>just like has no concern for humans.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>

1713
01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:16.840
<v Speaker 4>They've ruled out that humans are </v>
<v Speaker 4>troublesome,</v>

1714
01:16:17.050 --> 01:16:22.050
<v Speaker 4>so you had this long absence of no </v>
<v Speaker 4>wolves in that ecosystem and when you </v>

1715
01:16:22.050 --> 01:16:26.461
<v Speaker 4>put wolves back in,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just taken those animals a really </v>

1716
01:16:26.461 --> 01:16:28.090
<v Speaker 4>long time to figure out how to get back </v>
<v Speaker 4>to,</v>

1717
01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:30.190
<v Speaker 4>to get back to knowing what's going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>be.</v>

1718
01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:35.580
<v Speaker 4>And so we had inflated.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We had inflated numbers of elk and </v>

1719
01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:35.580
<v Speaker 4>somewhat argue inflated numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 4>elk,</v>

1720
01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:38.320
<v Speaker 4>someone arguing inflated numbers of </v>
<v Speaker 4>moose and when the wolves came back,</v>

1721
01:16:38.350 --> 01:16:40.390
<v Speaker 4>it's just.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean,</v>

1722
01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:43.080
<v Speaker 4>just plowed into the ground.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's tea,</v>

1723
01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:46.510
<v Speaker 4>there's hurt mountain range that maybe </v>
<v Speaker 4>had $9,000.</v>

1724
01:16:46.720 --> 01:16:51.720
<v Speaker 4>Now they're down to less than 2000.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I was talking with a guy from a </v>

1725
01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:53.920
<v Speaker 4>conservation organization that deals </v>
<v Speaker 4>with elk and they're looking at the very</v>

1726
01:16:54.970 --> 01:16:59.680
<v Speaker 4>real probability of if the wolf </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation ever does get under control in</v>

1727
01:16:59.681 --> 01:17:04.681
<v Speaker 4>the area of having to reintroduce elk </v>
<v Speaker 4>into some mountain ranges because </v>

1728
01:17:04.681 --> 01:17:06.850
<v Speaker 4>there's a paucity of breeding age,</v>
<v Speaker 4>female god,</v>

1729
01:17:06.851 --> 01:17:09.560
<v Speaker 4>because they're all getting killed by </v>
<v Speaker 4>wolves and it's just like,</v>

1730
01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:10.050
<v Speaker 4>jeez,</v>

1731
01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:15.910
<v Speaker 7>you still have groups that are trying to</v>
<v Speaker 7>stop the wool funds in Montana and </v>

1732
01:17:15.910 --> 01:17:15.910
<v Speaker 7>Idaho.</v>

1733
01:17:15.910 --> 01:17:16.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is also,</v>

1734
01:17:16.491 --> 01:17:21.491
<v Speaker 1>I heard you can't actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't shoot your way out of this </v>

1735
01:17:21.491 --> 01:17:21.491
<v Speaker 1>problem when it comes to walls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact.</v>

1736
01:17:21.491 --> 01:17:22.760
<v Speaker 1>Rise to hear that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

1737
01:17:22.761 --> 01:17:23.500
<v Speaker 1>But then that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

1738
01:17:23.810 --> 01:17:27.610
<v Speaker 1>that poses boxes and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're talking joe.</v>

1739
01:17:28.060 --> 01:17:29.940
<v Speaker 1>I've never been a fan of wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People,</v>

1740
01:17:29.941 --> 01:17:34.941
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to pretend they're dogs and get all </v>

1741
01:17:34.941 --> 01:17:34.941
<v Speaker 1>attached to him because you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like your colleagues,</v>

1742
01:17:34.941 --> 01:17:36.290
<v Speaker 1>that's a fucking wolf and that'll eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

1743
01:17:36.350 --> 01:17:38.060
<v Speaker 1>And they've eaten people before and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact.</v>

1744
01:17:38.270 --> 01:17:40.670
<v Speaker 1>I told the story on the podcast about </v>
<v Speaker 1>France,</v>

1745
01:17:40.790 --> 01:17:45.790
<v Speaker 1>France.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say brian France used to come in </v>

1746
01:17:45.790 --> 01:17:47.540
<v Speaker 1>people before they cornered them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed them.</v>

1747
01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:52.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean they've really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't think there's any real </v>

1748
01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:54.740
<v Speaker 1>argument be made that there's a human </v>
<v Speaker 1>risks not yet the highway.</v>

1749
01:17:54.741 --> 01:17:57.980
<v Speaker 1>Now there's an argument to made that </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an ecological risks.</v>

1750
01:17:58.040 --> 01:17:59.900
<v Speaker 1>I think there's still a human risk.</v>

1751
01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:03.070
<v Speaker 1>I think if you get around a big pack of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them and you just.</v>

1752
01:18:03.300 --> 01:18:06.830
<v Speaker 1>A child happens to be in that area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While that's called going down,</v>

1753
01:18:06.831 --> 01:18:11.831
<v Speaker 1>someone sneaks out of the house and they</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a farm and there's a story I read </v>

1754
01:18:11.831 --> 01:18:16.751
<v Speaker 1>online about this woman who is watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>these wolves tear apart sheep in her </v>

1755
01:18:16.751 --> 01:18:19.320
<v Speaker 1>backyard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was fucking wild.</v>

1756
01:18:19.321 --> 01:18:21.500
<v Speaker 1>I don't play around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She said they got into this,</v>

1757
01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:25.460
<v Speaker 1>they have a pen of sheep and they got in</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was like four or five wolf's.</v>

1758
01:18:25.461 --> 01:18:30.461
<v Speaker 1>We're just running through ripping these</v>
<v Speaker 1>sheep apart and you just heard these </v>

1759
01:18:30.461 --> 01:18:33.911
<v Speaker 1>horrific noise is tearing and grappling </v>
<v Speaker 1>and horrible sheep screens.</v>

1760
01:18:38.450 --> 01:18:40.520
<v Speaker 1>He's looking out the window watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>this going,</v>

1761
01:18:40.521 --> 01:18:42.710
<v Speaker 1>holy fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that.</v>

1762
01:18:42.711 --> 01:18:45.320
<v Speaker 1>That's going down in your yard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then they know that this is a.</v>

1763
01:18:45.321 --> 01:18:47.290
<v Speaker 1>This is a place where food is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How big is it?</v>

1764
01:18:47.291 --> 01:18:49.340
<v Speaker 1>Timber wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They go to like 100 and 2,030</v>

1765
01:18:49.341 --> 01:18:52.780
<v Speaker 1>pounds bigger than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then the real big ones that they're</v>

1766
01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:56.660
<v Speaker 1>experiencing now mean these deer are </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting very large for meeting all these</v>

1767
01:18:56.661 --> 01:18:59.200
<v Speaker 1>elk and even all these deer that didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>know they were coming there.</v>

1768
01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:04.460
<v Speaker 1>There's people that are shooting them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're taking pictures of him and you </v>

1769
01:19:04.460 --> 01:19:05.960
<v Speaker 1>would swear it's a photoshop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are enormous fucking wolves.</v>

1770
01:19:06.100 --> 01:19:09.500
<v Speaker 1>So you're like guys holding them and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing that looks as long as them.</v>

1771
01:19:09.530 --> 01:19:12.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean I don't know what it waves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's more than a hundred 50 pounds.</v>

1772
01:19:13.010 --> 01:19:15.710
<v Speaker 1>They're big dogs are big wolves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I actually like,</v>

1773
01:19:15.810 --> 01:19:20.810
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to get rid of all the wolf </v>

1774
01:19:20.810 --> 01:19:20.810
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I support.</v>

1775
01:19:20.810 --> 01:19:21.220
<v Speaker 1>I support wolf recovery cam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You got,</v>

1776
01:19:21.230 --> 01:19:23.900
<v Speaker 1>I mean you deal with wildlife.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No so much while they.</v>

1777
01:19:23.901 --> 01:19:26.240
<v Speaker 1>PolItics was sort of like public </v>
<v Speaker 1>perception of public opinion.</v>

1778
01:19:26.241 --> 01:19:31.241
<v Speaker 1>Would you say that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean hundreds of being billed as </v>

1779
01:19:31.241 --> 01:19:31.241
<v Speaker 1>being,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanting to destroy rules,</v>

1780
01:19:31.241 --> 01:19:32.990
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's not really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not what I hear.</v>

1781
01:19:33.610 --> 01:19:34.150
<v Speaker 1>Destroying</v>

1782
01:19:34.210 --> 01:19:36.020
<v Speaker 7>the wolf.</v>
<v Speaker 7>It's just pulled that mic up.</v>

1783
01:19:36.310 --> 01:19:38.440
<v Speaker 7>It's about getting that balance back </v>
<v Speaker 7>right now.</v>

1784
01:19:38.441 --> 01:19:39.160
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that's the thing.</v>

1785
01:19:39.161 --> 01:19:44.161
<v Speaker 7>So you've got these groups that are out </v>
<v Speaker 7>there trying to stop the wolf and they </v>

1786
01:19:44.161 --> 01:19:44.950
<v Speaker 7>want to put the wolf back on the </v>
<v Speaker 7>endangered species list,</v>

1787
01:19:44.951 --> 01:19:46.780
<v Speaker 7>even though the wolf is no longer </v>
<v Speaker 7>endangered,</v>

1788
01:19:47.080 --> 01:19:48.790
<v Speaker 7>the wolf isn't threatened in these </v>
<v Speaker 7>areas.</v>

1789
01:19:48.791 --> 01:19:53.791
<v Speaker 7>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 7>these local areas that We're talking </v>

1790
01:19:53.791 --> 01:19:54.220
<v Speaker 7>about here know in the state of Idaho,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the state of Montana,</v>

1791
01:19:54.550 --> 01:19:55.580
<v Speaker 7>um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>there,</v>

1792
01:19:55.870 --> 01:19:59.800
<v Speaker 7>there is a way to try to manage the </v>
<v Speaker 7>wildlife so you get that balance.</v>

1793
01:19:59.801 --> 01:20:02.110
<v Speaker 7>But right now,</v>
<v Speaker 7>what have you seen as sort of,</v>

1794
01:20:02.170 --> 01:20:07.170
<v Speaker 7>it's out of whack and right now the wolf</v>
<v Speaker 7>has the advantage and we're continuing </v>

1795
01:20:07.170 --> 01:20:07.770
<v Speaker 7>to give the advantage to the wolf and </v>
<v Speaker 7>some of these states.</v>

1796
01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:09.860
<v Speaker 7>And I think that's why you're trying to,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that.</v>

1797
01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:12.090
<v Speaker 7>That's where that,</v>
<v Speaker 7>that battle comes in right now.</v>

1798
01:20:12.300 --> 01:20:14.360
<v Speaker 7>What one wants to see,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I don't think anyone wants to see wolfs</v>

1799
01:20:15.070 --> 01:20:18.850
<v Speaker 5>pulled these unrealistic urban people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's really what it boils down to.</v>

1800
01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:24.480
<v Speaker 5>The people that are really,</v>
<v Speaker 5>almost all the people that are against </v>

1801
01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:25.400
<v Speaker 5>hunting or against,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

1802
01:20:25.401 --> 01:20:27.500
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the idea of a wildlife,</v>

1803
01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:33.240
<v Speaker 5>wildlife management.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Almost all of them live in cities when </v>

1804
01:20:33.240 --> 01:20:35.200
<v Speaker 5>when people live in a place where you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you have to contend with it,</v>

1805
01:20:35.230 --> 01:20:39.010
<v Speaker 5>someone has to be the top predator and </v>
<v Speaker 5>if it's not going to be a person,</v>

1806
01:20:39.340 --> 01:20:42.400
<v Speaker 5>it's not going to be people and you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>living around these animals,</v>

1807
01:20:42.550 --> 01:20:46.150
<v Speaker 5>it's going to be them and that's just </v>
<v Speaker 5>the reality of the food chain of life.</v>

1808
01:20:46.151 --> 01:20:51.151
<v Speaker 5>If you're a meek person and you're </v>
<v Speaker 5>wandering around through the woods and </v>

1809
01:20:51.151 --> 01:20:55.261
<v Speaker 5>you stumble into a pack of hungry wolves</v>
<v Speaker 5>and haven't seen an elk because it </v>

1810
01:20:55.261 --> 01:20:55.600
<v Speaker 5>decimated the population,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they'll kill you.</v>

1811
01:20:56.170 --> 01:20:59.260
<v Speaker 5>I mean that's reality happen.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Might not happen,</v>

1812
01:20:59.261 --> 01:21:02.140
<v Speaker 5>but it's happened before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A woman died in Alaska recently.</v>

1813
01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:05.330
<v Speaker 5>She was killed by wolves and it was also</v>
<v Speaker 5>wearing an alc.</v>

1814
01:21:05.370 --> 01:21:07.990
<v Speaker 5>So that was the first documented case in</v>
<v Speaker 5>a long time.</v>

1815
01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:13.020
<v Speaker 5>I was like 100 years in that state.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that 90 percent of the 95 </v>

1816
01:21:13.751 --> 01:21:18.751
<v Speaker 5>percent of traditional wolf habitat in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Alaska is still occupied by wolves.</v>

1817
01:21:20.200 --> 01:21:20.840
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And they.</v>

1818
01:21:20.850 --> 01:21:23.530
<v Speaker 5>And they have very,</v>
<v Speaker 5>very few fatalities.</v>

1819
01:21:23.890 --> 01:21:26.220
<v Speaker 5>I think that moose kill more people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

1820
01:21:26.230 --> 01:21:26.920
<v Speaker 5>they do.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They're in.</v>

1821
01:21:26.921 --> 01:21:31.921
<v Speaker 5>Anything else?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You also naTional park the greatest </v>

1822
01:21:31.921 --> 01:21:31.921
<v Speaker 5>cause of injury.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now yellowstone national park is getting</v>

1823
01:21:31.921 --> 01:21:34.930
<v Speaker 5>gored by a buffalo.</v>
<v Speaker 5>My parents live in Utah in park city.</v>

1824
01:21:34.931 --> 01:21:36.340
<v Speaker 5>You know what they always tell you?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The locals,</v>

1825
01:21:36.341 --> 01:21:36.910
<v Speaker 5>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>

1826
01:21:37.300 --> 01:21:42.300
<v Speaker 5>be careful of moose.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Please don't think of them as dear to </v>

1827
01:21:42.300 --> 01:21:46.310
<v Speaker 5>not approach them and what do people do </v>
<v Speaker 5>that like there's going to take a </v>

1828
01:21:46.310 --> 01:21:46.510
<v Speaker 5>picture and the moose is like,</v>

1831
01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:52.230

<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1832
01:21:52.280 --> 01:21:53.820
<v Speaker 7>urban areas.</v>
<v Speaker 7>A lot of people who,</v>

1833
01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:58.840
<v Speaker 7>who grow up in urban areas only live in </v>
<v Speaker 7>urban areas have very unrealistic </v>

1834
01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:00.980
<v Speaker 7>expectations of what aniMals are.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They have this anthropomorphic,</v>

1835
01:22:00.981 --> 01:22:02.580
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>operaTe.</v>

<v Speaker 7>It's bambi and they don't understand.</v>
<v Speaker 7>No,</v>

1837

<v Speaker 7>they,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1838
01:22:05.871 --> 01:22:07.000
<v Speaker 7>I just became a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a,</v>

1839
01:22:07.130 --> 01:22:10.760
<v Speaker 7>a farmer now,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so I have pigs and chickens and I,</v>

1840
01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:12.680
<v Speaker 7>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it's so completely different actually,</v>

1841
01:22:12.681 --> 01:22:14.570
<v Speaker 7>like sit down and study these animals.</v>

1842
01:22:14.670 --> 01:22:19.670
<v Speaker 5>Are you doing for your business?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Are you doing it for me to provide for </v>

1843
01:22:19.670 --> 01:22:19.850
<v Speaker 5>yourself?</v>

1844
01:22:19.890 --> 01:22:21.510
<v Speaker 7>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 7>All of the above.</v>

1845
01:22:21.570 --> 01:22:26.570
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 7>eventually I'd like to get to the point </v>

1846
01:22:26.570 --> 01:22:26.570
<v Speaker 7>where I can sell some,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1847
01:22:26.570 --> 01:22:26.570
<v Speaker 7>we're doing a heritage livestock,</v>

1848
01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:31.090
<v Speaker 5>where is it doing something like this </v>
<v Speaker 5>recently,</v>

1849
01:22:31.170 --> 01:22:36.170
<v Speaker 5>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it seems like if you have resources and </v>

1850
01:22:36.170 --> 01:22:39.451
<v Speaker 5>you could get a plot of land and hire </v>
<v Speaker 5>people to take care of it and grow it </v>

1851
01:22:39.451 --> 01:22:41.830
<v Speaker 5>and have animals that you slaughter </v>
<v Speaker 5>there and have food that you grow.</v>

1852
01:22:41.831 --> 01:22:43.540
<v Speaker 5>They're like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why wouldn't you do that?</v>

1853
01:22:43.541 --> 01:22:44.380
<v Speaker 5>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you could do that,</v>

1854
01:22:44.381 --> 01:22:46.060
<v Speaker 5>why wouldn't you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

1855
01:22:46.061 --> 01:22:46.110
<v Speaker 5>Really?</v>

1856
01:22:46.110 --> 01:22:46.590
<v Speaker 7>But,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1857
01:22:46.591 --> 01:22:51.591
<v Speaker 7>it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>it drives me crazy to hear these people </v>

1858
01:22:51.591 --> 01:22:51.591
<v Speaker 7>say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>oh,</v>

1859
01:22:51.591 --> 01:22:52.770
<v Speaker 7>but look,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the biggest smiling and the pig is happy</v>

1860
01:22:52.771 --> 01:22:54.540
<v Speaker 7>and the pig is the pig.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Loves you.</v>

1861
01:22:54.541 --> 01:22:56.790
<v Speaker 7>And how are you going to kill that pig </v>
<v Speaker 7>and turn it into bacon?</v>

1862
01:22:56.791 --> 01:22:58.410
<v Speaker 7>I'm telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the pig doesn't love me.</v>

1863
01:22:58.411 --> 01:23:03.411
<v Speaker 7>The pig,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the biggest pig and my doesn't know in </v>

1864
01:23:03.411 --> 01:23:03.411
<v Speaker 7>my.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm a lovable guy.</v>

1865
01:23:03.411 --> 01:23:04.460
<v Speaker 7>But uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

1866
01:23:04.470 --> 01:23:05.530
<v Speaker 7>I'd be honest with you.</v>

1867
01:23:06.410 --> 01:23:11.410
<v Speaker 1>I think we'll talk later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A good way to look at man's thoughts </v>

1868
01:23:11.410 --> 01:23:12.520
<v Speaker 1>that some thoughts together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good way to look at it.</v>

1869
01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:16.360
<v Speaker 1>He's not going to live forever if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't kill that big,</v>

1870
01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:18.520
<v Speaker 1>so I got to turn into a fairy and cure </v>
<v Speaker 1>cancer.</v>

1871
01:23:18.521 --> 01:23:21.000
<v Speaker 1>It's a fucking pig.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They lived to be about 15.</v>

1872
01:23:21.020 --> 01:23:24.730
<v Speaker 1>Then they die when they die.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you don't eat them before they die,</v>

1873
01:23:24.731 --> 01:23:28.420
<v Speaker 1>you lose all of delicious meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This pig,</v>

1874
01:23:28.510 --> 01:23:33.510
<v Speaker 1>the pigs that I have on my farm would </v>
<v Speaker 1>not exist unless we were going to eat </v>

1875
01:23:33.510 --> 01:23:34.840
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the only by that logic.</v>

1876
01:23:34.970 --> 01:23:36.850
<v Speaker 1>We could make your own kids and start </v>
<v Speaker 1>eating them.</v>

1877
01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:42.700
<v Speaker 1>We weren't listening earlier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I made kids because where I live at </v>

1878
01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:44.260
<v Speaker 1>goodchild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See I made kids for the free labor.</v>

1879
01:23:44.350 --> 01:23:45.520
<v Speaker 1>See I've got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unlike steve,</v>

<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

1882
01:23:48.670 --> 01:23:53.670
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to do get out there and all</v>
<v Speaker 1>my yard to pull it up.</v>

<v Speaker 1>would do this,</v>

1886
01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:03.150
<v Speaker 1>this or agriculture?</v>

<v Speaker 1>but I would.</v>

1888
01:24:04.070 --> 01:24:05.530
<v Speaker 1>I would think about buying a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>land.</v>

01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:07.850
<v Speaker 1>Just getting something positive.</v>

01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:43.990
<v Speaker 1>Becoming a farmer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea has been fucking around with me</v>

1925
01:25:44.230 --> 01:25:47.110
<v Speaker 1>for the past couple of months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know you got cHickens,</v>

1926
01:25:47.111 --> 01:25:52.111
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could just have them read at your </v>

1927
01:25:52.111 --> 01:25:52.111
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

1928
01:25:52.111 --> 01:25:54.240
<v Speaker 1>Built a chicken coop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you have somebody taking care of it </v>

1929
01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:54.240
<v Speaker 1>or is it just real easy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like.</v>

1930
01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:54.240
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not that hard.</v>

1931
01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:55.730
<v Speaker 1>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just built a planter.</v>

1932
01:25:55.731 --> 01:25:57.230
<v Speaker 1>I didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My beard.</v>

1933
01:25:57.990 --> 01:26:02.990
<v Speaker 1>I had a planter built.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just think it's a great idea and I </v>

1934
01:26:02.990 --> 01:26:04.020
<v Speaker 1>think that the idea of reliant on </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody else for</v>

1935
01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:09.020
<v Speaker 5>your own food ultimately it's like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why would you do that if you have the </v>

1936
01:26:09.020 --> 01:26:09.020
<v Speaker 5>resources yet,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1937
01:26:09.020 --> 01:26:11.580
<v Speaker 5>and is there only one left?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Is that what is bring them all out?</v>

1938
01:26:12.520 --> 01:26:13.440
<v Speaker 5>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

1939
01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:15.200
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

1940
01:26:15.210 --> 01:26:16.800
<v Speaker 5>the idea that we,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we,</v>

1941
01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:18.900
<v Speaker 5>we all rely on supermarkets.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You knoW,</v>

1942
01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:20.640
<v Speaker 5>you look at what happened with hurricane</v>
<v Speaker 5>sandy,</v>

1943
01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:21.990
<v Speaker 5>New York,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'd shut down.</v>

01:26:22.050 --> 01:26:24.000
<v Speaker 5>I was talking to my buddy tommy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>he's like,</v>

1945
01:26:24.060 --> 01:26:26.880
<v Speaker 5>I had a drive hours just to be able to </v>
<v Speaker 5>use my cell phone.</v>

1946
01:26:27.240 --> 01:26:28.530
<v Speaker 5>Towers were down,</v>
<v Speaker 5>everything was down.</v>

1947
01:26:28.531 --> 01:26:29.880
<v Speaker 5>There's no power.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything was fucked.</v>

1948
01:26:30.300 --> 01:26:31.740
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>him talking about.</v>

1949
01:26:31.741 --> 01:26:32.160

<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>

1951
01:26:33.601 --> 01:26:36.840
<v Speaker 5>because I realized like This whole thing</v>
<v Speaker 5>is like very fragile.</v>

1952
01:26:36.860 --> 01:26:38.370
<v Speaker 5>If you don't know where your food's </v>
<v Speaker 5>coming from.</v>

1953
01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:39.990
<v Speaker 5>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we went to the supermarket.</v>

1954
01:26:39.991 --> 01:26:44.991
<v Speaker 5>It was just insane.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was just empty shelf after empty </v>

1955
01:26:44.991 --> 01:26:44.991
<v Speaker 5>shell.</v>
<v Speaker 5>People had just taken everything.</v>

1956
01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.730
<v Speaker 5>There was nothing left.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there's not a supply.</v>

1957
01:26:48.480 --> 01:26:49.680
<v Speaker 4>Sam,</v>
<v Speaker 4>what about water?</v>

1958
01:26:50.390 --> 01:26:54.360
<v Speaker 4>Water reserves have underground tunnels </v>
<v Speaker 4>have nothing in my basement.</v>

1959
01:26:54.361 --> 01:26:57.040
<v Speaker 4>Now I'm getting to be like an old weird </v>
<v Speaker 4>man where I save 'em,</v>

1960
01:26:57.690 --> 01:26:59.310
<v Speaker 4>freeze dried food and stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 4>My base,</v>

1961
01:26:59.311 --> 01:27:04.311
<v Speaker 4>very smart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I still haven't done the water </v>

1962
01:27:04.311 --> 01:27:04.311
<v Speaker 4>things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you got to do,</v>

1963
01:27:04.311 --> 01:27:04.311
<v Speaker 4>I got to get,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

1964
01:27:04.311 --> 01:27:07.970
<v Speaker 4>our tech,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the farming deal home farming.</v>

1965
01:27:07.980 --> 01:27:12.980
<v Speaker 4>My brother,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he has those pack lIne was you've seen </v>

1966
01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:12.980
<v Speaker 4>those packs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I love those things,</v>

1967
01:27:12.980 --> 01:27:16.490
<v Speaker 4>so he bought a 10 acre pasture,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a very unpicked your ass just like </v>

1968
01:27:17.400 --> 01:27:22.400
<v Speaker 4>an irrigated pasture and realized his </v>
<v Speaker 4>llamas are just inhabit like a back </v>

1969
01:27:22.400 --> 01:27:25.110
<v Speaker 4>corner and when you use diddly of this </v>
<v Speaker 4>pasture,</v>

1970
01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:30.680
<v Speaker 4>so just because he's just a pragmatic </v>
<v Speaker 4>resourceful person and he thought it's </v>

1971
01:27:32.011 --> 01:27:35.340
<v Speaker 4>out there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's getting wet and growing grass.</v>

1972
01:27:35.670 --> 01:27:40.670
<v Speaker 4>So he started putting out lambs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He put out goats now has got a calf out </v>

1973
01:27:41.191 --> 01:27:44.700
<v Speaker 4>there and this guy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he hunts so much so he hunts off his own</v>

1974
01:27:44.701 --> 01:27:48.600
<v Speaker 4>neat and he eats the media hunts and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>just puts it out there and takes care of</v>

1975
01:27:48.601 --> 01:27:50.670
<v Speaker 4>it,</v>
<v Speaker 4>make sure it has water and then it gives</v>

1976
01:27:50.671 --> 01:27:54.690
<v Speaker 4>all that stuff to his friends who come </v>
<v Speaker 4>over and butcher the lands and take them</v>

1977
01:27:54.691 --> 01:27:56.520
<v Speaker 4>home and feed them to theIr kids.</v>

1978
01:27:56.910 --> 01:28:00.510
<v Speaker 4>It just kind of a sense of like if the </v>
<v Speaker 4>lands there,</v>

1979
01:28:00.570 --> 01:28:02.460
<v Speaker 4>you know what I mean?</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like it's there.</v>

1980
01:28:02.461 --> 01:28:07.461
<v Speaker 4>It's been manipulated by man.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's not that he's preserving some kind </v>

1981
01:28:07.461 --> 01:28:10.281
<v Speaker 4>of like prime evil ecosystem.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just an irrigated pasture of </v>

1982
01:28:10.281 --> 01:28:10.800
<v Speaker 4>alfalfa.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's like,</v>

1983
01:28:10.801 --> 01:28:15.801
<v Speaker 4>why not have that be like have output.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's just pleasant to look out my window</v>

1984
01:28:16.471 --> 01:28:17.370
<v Speaker 4>and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's producing,</v>

1985
01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:19.020
<v Speaker 4>producing,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but when you have,</v>

1986
01:28:19.021 --> 01:28:24.021
<v Speaker 4>when you have,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you have an acre of land or </v>

1987
01:28:24.021 --> 01:28:24.021
<v Speaker 4>whatever that is and how he's growing </v>
<v Speaker 4>alfalfa,</v>

1988
01:28:24.021 --> 01:28:25.470
<v Speaker 4>is that all you need for the animal to </v>
<v Speaker 4>live?</v>

1989
01:28:25.471 --> 01:28:30.471
<v Speaker 4>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you just put it out there and they </v>

1990
01:28:30.471 --> 01:28:30.471
<v Speaker 4>just live on that?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

1991
01:28:30.471 --> 01:28:30.471
<v Speaker 4>I'm delving into stuff I don't </v>
<v Speaker 4>understand now,</v>

1992
01:28:30.471 --> 01:28:34.140
<v Speaker 4>but I know that camper,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I speak to this better because that he's</v>

1993
01:28:34.141 --> 01:28:36.600
<v Speaker 4>got alfalfa,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it's an old alfalfa field,</v>

1994
01:28:36.601 --> 01:28:40.800
<v Speaker 4>so I think people typically in some </v>
<v Speaker 4>areas I know replant alfalfa every seven</v>

1995
01:28:40.801 --> 01:28:45.801
<v Speaker 4>years because eventually the alfalfa </v>
<v Speaker 4>loses out to other plant species is my </v>

1996
01:28:45.801 --> 01:28:47.820
<v Speaker 4>understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't know for sure that there's a lot</v>

1997
01:28:47.821 --> 01:28:51.300
<v Speaker 4>of animals.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you go out and put them on just that.</v>

1998
01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:53.850
<v Speaker 4>I'm sure there's a lot of guys that know</v>
<v Speaker 4>a lot about this,</v>

1999
01:28:53.910 --> 01:28:57.360
<v Speaker 4>like cringing right now.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you go and put my just alfalfa,</v>

2000
01:28:57.680 --> 01:29:02.250
<v Speaker 4>it's considered to be like a hot food </v>
<v Speaker 4>and they'll overeat</v>

2001
01:29:02.250 --> 01:29:07.250
<v Speaker 5>is too rich and it can damage themselves</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you put them out on just pure </v>

2002
01:29:07.351 --> 01:29:12.351
<v Speaker 5>alfalfa.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's interesting because I read the </v>

2003
01:29:12.351 --> 01:29:12.570
<v Speaker 5>deer that eat out of alfalfa fields are </v>
<v Speaker 5>delicious.</v>

2004
01:29:12.571 --> 01:29:15.920
<v Speaker 5>That there they actually have like a </v>
<v Speaker 5>little more species can hack it by.</v>

2005
01:29:15.930 --> 01:29:18.230
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that I've been told that i'M</v>

2006
01:29:18.310 --> 01:29:20.110
<v Speaker 7>horses.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Does any of this makes sense To you?</v>

2007
01:29:20.290 --> 01:29:25.290
<v Speaker 7>A little bit,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but I'm more pig and chicken as opposed </v>

2008
01:29:25.290 --> 01:29:25.290
<v Speaker 7>to a lamb and stuff.</v>

2009
01:29:25.290 --> 01:29:28.670
<v Speaker 5>Does that make sense?</v>
<v Speaker 5>With alfalfa making the deer tastes </v>

2010
01:29:28.670 --> 01:29:28.670
<v Speaker 5>better?</v>

2011
01:29:28.670 --> 01:29:28.670
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it was.</v>

2012
01:29:28.670 --> 01:29:29.300
<v Speaker 7>The deer is not going to just be eating </v>
<v Speaker 7>alfalfa either.</v>

2013
01:29:29.301 --> 01:29:30.650
<v Speaker 7>I mean the deer is going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2014
01:29:30.651 --> 01:29:32.500
<v Speaker 7>roman and getting a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Of course.</v>

2015
01:29:33.710 --> 01:29:36.320
<v Speaker 7>How much land is a farmer?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Do you need to grow,</v>

2016
01:29:36.860 --> 01:29:39.500
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>your own meat and your own vegetables?</v>

2017
01:29:39.590 --> 01:29:41.660
<v Speaker 7>Not much.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean really not much.</v>

2018
01:29:41.661 --> 01:29:43.520
<v Speaker 7>You could do it on.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So we've got 40 acres,</v>

2019
01:29:43.521 --> 01:29:46.970
<v Speaker 7>but right now we're only using about </v>
<v Speaker 7>four and we've got,</v>

2020
01:29:46.971 --> 01:29:48.440
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we've got our big garden,</v>

2021
01:29:48.441 --> 01:29:50.210
<v Speaker 7>we've got our chickens that are free </v>
<v Speaker 7>ranging,</v>

2022
01:29:50.211 --> 01:29:52.280
<v Speaker 7>we've got the pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we're going to be getting some dairy,</v>

2023
01:29:52.281 --> 01:29:54.500
<v Speaker 7>goats and really like,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2024
01:29:55.340 --> 01:29:59.000
<v Speaker 7>and really four acres is,</v>
<v Speaker 7>we don't even use all that space.</v>

2025
01:29:59.001 --> 01:30:01.010
<v Speaker 7>I mean they're spread out the picture </v>
<v Speaker 7>over here,</v>

2026
01:30:01.190 --> 01:30:03.020

2029
01:30:06.080 --> 01:30:11.080
<v Speaker 7>you guys could feed like 30 people or 40</v>
<v Speaker 7>acres or we're way more.</v>

2030
01:30:11.610 --> 01:30:12.260
<v Speaker 7>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 7>That's why,</v>

2031
01:30:12.261 --> 01:30:17.261
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>eventually what we want to do is to get </v>

<v Speaker 7>a shitloaD.</v>

2050
01:30:56.450 --> 01:30:58.160
<v Speaker 7>When I was a kid who never stopped</v>

2051
01:30:58.240 --> 01:31:03.240
<v Speaker 5>when I was a kid and my stepdad was a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>he was in school and one of the </v>

2052
01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:06.901
<v Speaker 5>agriculture classes that he had to take </v>
<v Speaker 5>was like this co op farm that people in </v>

2053
01:31:06.901 --> 01:31:11.310
<v Speaker 5>the school all did together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They had animals and they grew plants </v>

2054
01:31:11.310 --> 01:31:13.810
<v Speaker 5>and I mean it was like pretty like </v>
<v Speaker 5>involved thing.</v>

2055
01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:17.440
<v Speaker 5>And I remember even as a kid saying what</v>
<v Speaker 5>a cool idea.</v>

2056
01:31:17.470 --> 01:31:19.960
<v Speaker 5>The idea that they all like chip in </v>
<v Speaker 5>together.</v>

2057
01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:25.080
<v Speaker 5>Everybody does like a little piece of </v>
<v Speaker 5>something and everyone's sort of </v>

2058
01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:25.080
<v Speaker 5>communicates what's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what needs to get done.</v>

2059
01:31:25.270 --> 01:31:27.730
<v Speaker 5>And if you think about that in a real </v>
<v Speaker 5>neighborhood man,</v>

2060
01:31:28.090 --> 01:31:33.090
<v Speaker 5>you could have as long as you had the </v>
<v Speaker 5>soil and as long as you had the </v>

2061
01:31:33.090 --> 01:31:35.590
<v Speaker 5>resources to get it started and then </v>
<v Speaker 5>make it so it's self sufficient.</v>

2062
01:31:35.740 --> 01:31:40.740
<v Speaker 5>If you had a sizable piece of land and </v>
<v Speaker 5>everybody sort of chipped in and you </v>

2063
01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:41.590
<v Speaker 5>grew livestock and you grew plants and </v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2064
01:31:41.591 --> 01:31:46.591
<v Speaker 5>you fed them and everything like see it </v>
<v Speaker 5>seems like it would be so economically </v>

2065
01:31:46.591 --> 01:31:50.880
<v Speaker 5>manageable.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean like people would get all their </v>

2066
01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:53.401
<v Speaker 5>food.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Keep imagine if like we all got all our </v>

2067
01:31:53.401 --> 01:31:55.441
<v Speaker 5>food from like a lot down the corner </v>
<v Speaker 5>where we all knew that this goat had </v>

2068
01:31:55.441 --> 01:31:57.910
<v Speaker 5>beaten all these foods that we had given</v>
<v Speaker 5>it.</v>

2069
01:31:57.911 --> 01:32:00.250
<v Speaker 5>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you knew exactly where the tomato</v>

2070
01:32:00.250 --> 01:32:02.470
<v Speaker 1>came from because you put the seed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ground.</v>

2071
01:32:02.800 --> 01:32:07.800
<v Speaker 1>This is happening to the point where in </v>
<v Speaker 1>cities now they have flat bed trucks </v>

2072
01:32:07.810 --> 01:32:11.110
<v Speaker 1>that you can rent where you have a flat </v>
<v Speaker 1>bed truck.</v>

2073
01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:15.190
<v Speaker 1>They got a bunch of soil on that flatbed</v>
<v Speaker 1>truck.</v>

2074
01:32:15.430 --> 01:32:20.430
<v Speaker 1>They're also doing an unruly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what people are doing is getting </v>

2075
01:32:20.430 --> 01:32:24.301
<v Speaker 1>timeshares and saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to buy a share of that flatbed </v>

2076
01:32:24.301 --> 01:32:24.340
<v Speaker 1>truck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Flatbed truck comes out,</v>

2077
01:32:24.341 --> 01:32:27.370
<v Speaker 1>you garden it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you take your vegetables for the day and</v>

2078
01:32:27.371 --> 01:32:30.370
<v Speaker 1>it moves on to the next house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also they're doing it with like.</v>

2079
01:32:30.430 --> 01:32:32.650
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of roof space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like in China,</v>

2080
01:32:32.651 --> 01:32:37.651
<v Speaker 1>they built a whole city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guess where the rooms are basically </v>

2081
01:32:37.651 --> 01:32:42.001
<v Speaker 1>planters to grow the food for the city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just saw a story out of chicago where </v>

2082
01:32:42.001 --> 01:32:45.631
<v Speaker 1>they're using some of the old warehouses</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they're just turning them into </v>

2083
01:32:45.631 --> 01:32:45.631
<v Speaker 1>indoor farms.</v>

2084
01:32:45.631 --> 01:32:49.840
<v Speaker 1>You've seen those two cia workers whose </v>
<v Speaker 1>house got broken into and Kansas.</v>

<v Speaker 1>home that shows that you're using some </v>

2090

<v Speaker 1>extraordinary amount of light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which mostly people using the to to grow</v>

<v Speaker 1>Cia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I make sense.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2104
01:33:49.700 --> 01:33:51.490
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crazy fucks.</v>

2105
01:33:51.820 --> 01:33:54.880
<v Speaker 4>W we had this thing happen reasonably.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was like this perfect,</v>

2106
01:33:54.881 --> 01:33:58.900
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a cohesion of hunting and farming where,</v>

2107
01:33:58.910 --> 01:34:03.910
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're down in Florida and we're hunting </v>

2108
01:34:03.910 --> 01:34:06.430
<v Speaker 4>turkeys on this guy's ranch and the guy </v>
<v Speaker 4>keeps coming in and getting this because</v>

2109
01:34:06.431 --> 01:34:07.480
<v Speaker 4>he wants us to go out at night</v>

2110
01:34:07.570 --> 01:34:09.800
<v Speaker 1>run hogs hound dogs</v>

2111
01:34:10.780 --> 01:34:14.170
<v Speaker 4>and what it is.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got a cattle ranch near okeechobee,</v>

2112
01:34:14.171 --> 01:34:17.320
<v Speaker 4>Florida and there's a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I heard two figures,</v>

2113
01:34:17.321 --> 01:34:19.300
<v Speaker 4>55,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>or 45,000</v>

2114
01:34:19.301 --> 01:34:23.500
<v Speaker 4>acre nature preserve down there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It has a lot of rare native birds on it.</v>

2115
01:34:23.501 --> 01:34:28.501
<v Speaker 4>And the nature preserves emo is they </v>
<v Speaker 4>just acquire agricultural land when it </v>

2116
01:34:28.501 --> 01:34:33.181
<v Speaker 4>comes up for sale and they take out the </v>
<v Speaker 4>dike systems and put it back into bird </v>

2117
01:34:33.181 --> 01:34:34.630
<v Speaker 4>habitat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it's funny because this guy actually</v>

2118
01:34:34.631 --> 01:34:38.590
<v Speaker 4>has sold this preserve some of his land </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he is putting his whole place into a</v>

2119
01:34:38.591 --> 01:34:40.930
<v Speaker 4>conservation easement so that at a time </v>
<v Speaker 4>he was like,</v>

2120
01:34:40.931 --> 01:34:42.280
<v Speaker 4>my whole place is going to be part of </v>
<v Speaker 4>that.</v>

2121
01:34:42.281 --> 01:34:43.720
<v Speaker 4>And he was,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he was actually glad about it.</v>

2122
01:34:43.721 --> 01:34:47.260
<v Speaker 4>He liked,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he liked the preserve but a big enemy of</v>

2123
01:34:47.261 --> 01:34:52.261
<v Speaker 4>the preserve as wild pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which consumed a lot of ground nesting </v>

2124
01:34:52.261 --> 01:34:54.070
<v Speaker 4>shorebird x.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they have a guy,</v>

2125
01:34:54.100 --> 01:34:59.100
<v Speaker 4>the preserve Is so tight,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so tightly administered that you can't </v>

2126
01:34:59.100 --> 01:34:59.100
<v Speaker 4>in most areas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can walk around in there.</v>

2127
01:34:59.100 --> 01:35:03.890
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they haven't got a contract to kill </v>

2128
01:35:03.890 --> 01:35:06.011
<v Speaker 4>wild pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So this guy has a contract where he's </v>

2129
01:35:06.011 --> 01:35:06.011
<v Speaker 4>supposed to kill x number of pIgs every </v>
<v Speaker 4>year.</v>

2130
01:35:06.170 --> 01:35:10.510
<v Speaker 4>He can't in any way keep up with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This guy that has his cattle ranch lakes</v>

2131
01:35:10.520 --> 01:35:13.340
<v Speaker 4>to hunt pigs and he would always go back</v>
<v Speaker 4>and hunt the,</v>

2132
01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:16.280
<v Speaker 4>the boundary between his ranch and the </v>
<v Speaker 4>preserve.</v>

2133
01:35:16.850 --> 01:35:21.850
<v Speaker 4>Because so many,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's such a great influx of pigs </v>

2134
01:35:21.850 --> 01:35:23.290
<v Speaker 4>coming off the preserve at night,</v>
<v Speaker 4>coming down to his ranch to get into,</v>

2135
01:35:23.330 --> 01:35:25.670
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>less utilized land and uh,</v>

2136
01:35:26.510 --> 01:35:31.510
<v Speaker 4>but it's dogs would chase them in.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The pigs have promptly run back into </v>

2137
01:35:31.510 --> 01:35:34.691
<v Speaker 4>that preserve where he can pursue him.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So he gets some hard proof fence and </v>

2138
01:35:34.971 --> 01:35:39.971
<v Speaker 4>builds a 400 acre enclosure,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a budding the preserve on the wall of </v>

2139
01:35:42.711 --> 01:35:47.711
<v Speaker 4>his fence that actually adjoins the </v>
<v Speaker 4>preserve he puts in trapdoors hinge </v>

2140
01:35:49.251 --> 01:35:49.790
<v Speaker 4>doors.</v>

2141
01:35:50.180 --> 01:35:55.180
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So the pigs can come in and out and so </v>

2142
01:35:55.180 --> 01:35:55.180
<v Speaker 4>they can't go out.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

2143
01:35:55.180 --> 01:35:55.180
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he,</v>

2144
01:35:55.180 --> 01:35:56.370
<v Speaker 4>he props the door open.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2145
01:35:57.080 --> 01:36:02.080
<v Speaker 4>Any kind of watches and he's always out </v>
<v Speaker 4>there checking for tracks and after </v>

2146
01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:05.381
<v Speaker 4>awhile you'll realize there's a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 4>pig traffic coming out of the preserve </v>

2147
01:36:05.381 --> 01:36:06.190
<v Speaker 4>onto his land.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then what he'll dO,</v>

2148
01:36:06.220 --> 01:36:11.220
<v Speaker 4>he knows that they come out after dark,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they come onto his ranch and before </v>

2149
01:36:11.220 --> 01:36:11.890
<v Speaker 4>daybreak they drift back to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>preserve,</v>

2150
01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:17.000
<v Speaker 4>closes the door.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He goes out at four in the morning and </v>

2151
01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:17.000
<v Speaker 4>pop up shirts.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All those doors.</v>

2152
01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:21.161
<v Speaker 4>He's got these doors strung out and </v>
<v Speaker 4>strung out for like a mile every 10 </v>

2153
01:36:21.831 --> 01:36:23.750
<v Speaker 4>yards.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Stick.</v>

2154
01:36:23.770 --> 01:36:26.660
<v Speaker 4>hold this thing down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pulls all the sticks.</v>

2155
01:36:26.661 --> 01:36:28.910
<v Speaker 4>That's hIlarious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it cuts his dogs loose.</v>

2156
01:36:29.020 --> 01:36:34.020
<v Speaker 4>Oh my god.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we go out with him and right away we </v>

2157
01:36:34.020 --> 01:36:36.010
<v Speaker 4>go out logs like pitbulls or pitbull </v>
<v Speaker 4>ask.</v>

2158
01:36:36.020 --> 01:36:38.430
<v Speaker 4>I'm not good enough for dogs but not </v>
<v Speaker 4>got.</v>

2159
01:36:38.470 --> 01:36:42.560

<v Speaker 4>He's got trailers and catchers.</v>

2160
01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:45.650
<v Speaker 4>So different types of dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 4>His bloodhounds find them,</v>

2161
01:36:45.651 --> 01:36:50.651
<v Speaker 4>but they won't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He don't like to let the bloodhounds </v>

2162
01:36:50.651 --> 01:36:50.651
<v Speaker 4>actually catch the pig is a pig.</v>

<v Speaker 4>we get one.</v>

2169
01:37:07.950 --> 01:37:12.030
<v Speaker 4>It's a big boy and he's intact.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He's got his nut sack on him still.</v>

2170
01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:15.990
<v Speaker 4>And the guy that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This one's not dogs usually pull off.</v>

2171
01:37:16.050 --> 01:37:17.960
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm getting a little ahead of myself.</v>

2172
01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:19.790
<v Speaker 4>Just just hold that piece.</v>
<v Speaker 4>May hold up.</v>

2173
01:37:19.791 --> 01:37:24.791
<v Speaker 4>He's information from it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Not for a moment.</v>

2174
01:37:25.131 --> 01:37:27.800
<v Speaker 4>John,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and he says this,</v>

2175
01:37:28.030 --> 01:37:29.980
<v Speaker 4>be any good to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like they're too lean.</v>

2176
01:37:29.981 --> 01:37:34.981
<v Speaker 4>They gotta let it testosterone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They don't take good care of themselves </v>

2177
01:37:34.981 --> 01:37:35.170
<v Speaker 4>and he takes his pig and it's a big pig,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2178
01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:38.260
<v Speaker 4>not big and not like the ones you see on</v>
<v Speaker 4>the internet,</v>

2179
01:37:38.261 --> 01:37:43.261
<v Speaker 4>but the size of 170 pound pig and he </v>
<v Speaker 4>puts in a trailer just to confine in </v>

2180
01:37:43.261 --> 01:37:47.831
<v Speaker 4>there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We go out and hunt again and a violator </v>

2181
01:37:47.831 --> 01:37:47.831
<v Speaker 4>of the dogs bus this other pig out of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2182
01:37:47.831 --> 01:37:52.410
<v Speaker 4>out of a palm grove.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They call the hammock like an island of </v>

2183
01:37:52.410 --> 01:37:55.000
<v Speaker 4>palm trees out in tHe grasslands.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And they catch it in this pigs castrated</v>

2184
01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:59.460
<v Speaker 4>and a castrated like a bore that'S been </v>
<v Speaker 4>castrated as a barrel hog.</v>

2185
01:38:00.930 --> 01:38:05.730
<v Speaker 4>And the incision where they were,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the hog had been castrated is all healed</v>

2186
01:38:05.731 --> 01:38:05.910
<v Speaker 4>up.</v>

2187
01:38:06.660 --> 01:38:09.390
<v Speaker 4>And they told me that we,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when we catch a boar,</v>

2188
01:38:09.391 --> 01:38:13.620
<v Speaker 4>we always castrated and then turn it </v>
<v Speaker 4>back loose because two things happen.</v>

2189
01:38:13.621 --> 01:38:17.430
<v Speaker 4>One,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the pig won't procreate,</v>

2190
01:38:17.490 --> 01:38:22.490
<v Speaker 4>won't contribute to the problem that the</v>
<v Speaker 4>preserve is having the problem that he </v>

2191
01:38:22.490 --> 01:38:26.481
<v Speaker 4>has for pigs on his land route in his </v>
<v Speaker 4>area and it'll and it will do what he </v>

2192
01:38:26.481 --> 01:38:29.220
<v Speaker 4>says is take his mind off grass and put </v>
<v Speaker 4>it on,</v>

2193
01:38:29.290 --> 01:38:34.290
<v Speaker 4>know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>take his mind off ass and put it on the </v>

2194
01:38:34.290 --> 01:38:36.291
<v Speaker 4>grass and he says in 90 days that will </v>
<v Speaker 4>be fantastic eating and they'll have a </v>

2195
01:38:37.351 --> 01:38:42.351
<v Speaker 4>layer of fat on them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So we cut the juggler on the castrated </v>

2196
01:38:42.540 --> 01:38:46.740
<v Speaker 4>pig and cut the meat and it smelled </v>
<v Speaker 4>great and was beautiful.</v>

2197
01:38:47.730 --> 01:38:52.730
<v Speaker 4>The next day we go out with the board we</v>
<v Speaker 4>caught and they take a knife and </v>

2198
01:38:53.161 --> 01:38:58.161
<v Speaker 4>castrate that bore and turn them out </v>
<v Speaker 4>knowing that sometime down the road </v>

2199
01:38:58.161 --> 01:39:02.601
<v Speaker 4>they'll be lucky and catch that bar </v>
<v Speaker 4>again and he'll be a barrel and then </v>

2200
01:39:02.601 --> 01:39:02.810
<v Speaker 4>he'll be good to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So these boys,</v>

2201
01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:04.370
<v Speaker 4>these boys do this every year.</v>

2202
01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:08.800
<v Speaker 1>How do you secure a bor?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A powerful boars head?</v>

2203
01:39:09.210 --> 01:39:14.210
<v Speaker 4>Don't tell anyone dogs these dogs take </v>
<v Speaker 4>them guys are cattle ranchers.</v>

2204
01:39:14.820 --> 01:39:16.190
<v Speaker 4>These guys are cattle ranchers.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So they,</v>

2205
01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:18.770
<v Speaker 4>I mean it's a daily occurrence for them </v>
<v Speaker 4>to rassle like,</v>

2206
01:39:19.130 --> 01:39:24.130
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>one of the dog does it because he </v>

2207
01:39:24.130 --> 01:39:24.130
<v Speaker 4>grabbed by the ear,</v>
<v Speaker 4>grab about,</v>

2208
01:39:24.130 --> 01:39:25.340
<v Speaker 4>hadn't pinned them down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now the tracking dogs caught the pig and</v>

2209
01:39:25.341 --> 01:39:27.650
<v Speaker 4>the pig caught one of the tracking dogs </v>
<v Speaker 4>real good.</v>

2210
01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:30.680
<v Speaker 4>And he was going to take that dog to the</v>
<v Speaker 4>vet and I asked him,</v>

2211
01:39:30.681 --> 01:39:34.280
<v Speaker 4>I bet Your vet probably,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2212
01:39:34.710 --> 01:39:39.710
<v Speaker 4>doesn't like you bring in dogs that </v>
<v Speaker 4>probably they may have gotten injured </v>

2213
01:39:39.710 --> 01:39:42.180
<v Speaker 4>and something that the vet might regard </v>
<v Speaker 4>as unnecessary or he goes,</v>

2214
01:39:42.181 --> 01:39:47.181
<v Speaker 4>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's why I go to a vet who likes to </v>

2215
01:39:47.181 --> 01:39:47.181
<v Speaker 4>run pigs with his dog.</v>

2216
01:39:47.410 --> 01:39:52.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once he start realizing how many pigs </v>

2217
01:39:52.410 --> 01:39:54.481
<v Speaker 1>there are there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially Texas has millions oF feral </v>

2218
01:39:54.481 --> 01:39:54.481
<v Speaker 1>pests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Millions,</v>

2219
01:39:54.481 --> 01:39:55.990
<v Speaker 1>they have a real millions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions.</v>

2220
01:39:56.230 --> 01:39:57.580
<v Speaker 1>They have a real problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

2221
01:39:57.670 --> 01:39:59.170
<v Speaker 1>I know you don't like that show pig,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

2222
01:39:59.530 --> 01:40:00.820
<v Speaker 1>But the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2223
01:40:00.840 --> 01:40:02.260
<v Speaker 1>I like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't say that</v>

2224
01:40:02.380 --> 01:40:03.700
<v Speaker 4>there's just,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's like there's a,</v>

2225
01:40:03.760 --> 01:40:06.200
<v Speaker 4>I haven't an intellectualized having an </v>
<v Speaker 4>aesthetic.</v>

2226
01:40:06.201 --> 01:40:09.710
<v Speaker 4>I haven't hunching aesthetic and an </v>
<v Speaker 4>approach to wildlife that,</v>

2227
01:40:09.810 --> 01:40:11.210
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>

2228
01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:12.570
<v Speaker 4>that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that I,</v>

2229
01:40:12.600 --> 01:40:14.370
<v Speaker 4>that I admire and that I tried to stand </v>
<v Speaker 4>by.</v>

2230
01:40:14.780 --> 01:40:15.630
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you do.</v>

2231
01:40:15.670 --> 01:40:19.680
<v Speaker 1>We had long conversations about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So helicopter gunships or your.</v>

2232
01:40:20.430 --> 01:40:24.030
<v Speaker 1>There's not mid on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not really hunting.</v>

2233
01:40:24.031 --> 01:40:29.031
<v Speaker 1>I mean what they're doing is they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting away with being psychopaths and </v>

2234
01:40:29.031 --> 01:40:30.150
<v Speaker 1>if you haven't seen it,</v>

<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

2239
01:40:40.380 --> 01:40:45.380
<v Speaker 1>it's a real fucking problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They really do have to eradicate these </v>

2240
01:40:45.380 --> 01:40:45.960
<v Speaker 1>populations of pigs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tear up.</v>

2241
01:40:45.961 --> 01:40:50.961
<v Speaker 1>I mean they show these crops that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting fucked up by these pigs in the </v>

<v Speaker 1>Is what I wanted to ask you.</v>

2244
01:40:53.980 --> 01:40:56.170

<v Speaker 4>Tastes like?</v>

<v Speaker 4>cooked yet.</v>

2246
01:40:58.331 --> 01:41:00.700
<v Speaker 4>We're cooking it on April 25th,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but it won't be as good.</v>

2247
01:41:00.701 --> 01:41:02.380
<v Speaker 4>You don't have to think.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2248
01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:02.950
<v Speaker 4>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2249
01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:04.600
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we.</v>

2250
01:41:04.601 --> 01:41:06.160
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>On April 25th,</v>

2251
01:41:06.220 --> 01:41:10.300
<v Speaker 4>I'm cooking the castro the barrel hard </v>
<v Speaker 4>right now.</v>

2252
01:41:10.301 --> 01:41:15.301
<v Speaker 4>I have eaten boars with their nuts,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but I've never even a board that was </v>

2253
01:41:15.820 --> 01:41:20.820
<v Speaker 4>aged and as venerable is that one you </v>
<v Speaker 4>could tell that he was a very old battle</v>

2254
01:41:22.931 --> 01:41:27.700
<v Speaker 4>scarred bore and very lean and these </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys I'm going to have eaten and thought</v>

2255
01:41:27.701 --> 01:41:32.701
<v Speaker 4>it was okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it might be that these guys have </v>

2256
01:41:32.701 --> 01:41:32.701
<v Speaker 4>very high expectations,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2257
01:41:32.701 --> 01:41:37.260
<v Speaker 4>they pick on enough or they have a sense</v>
<v Speaker 4>of like what's best and not best the </v>

2258
01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:40.561
<v Speaker 4>same way that uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you might disregard a hotdog,</v>

2259
01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:44.170
<v Speaker 4>half a hot dog laying on the side of the</v>
<v Speaker 4>road,</v>

2260
01:41:44.380 --> 01:41:49.380
<v Speaker 4>but another person might be in a </v>
<v Speaker 4>situation where they really appreciate </v>

2261
01:41:49.380 --> 01:41:49.380
<v Speaker 4>that hot dog.</v>

2262
01:41:49.380 --> 01:41:53.310
<v Speaker 4>So for these guYs who hunt boar is a lot</v>
<v Speaker 4>like love to eat them.</v>

2263
01:41:55.750 --> 01:41:57.160
<v Speaker 4>They were like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no.</v>

2264
01:41:57.550 --> 01:42:02.350
<v Speaker 4>And when I expressed interest in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>indian tact hog being like,</v>

2265
01:42:02.351 --> 01:42:03.310
<v Speaker 4>I don't care,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I want it.</v>

2266
01:42:03.670 --> 01:42:08.670
<v Speaker 4>They were so adamant that it wouldn't be</v>
<v Speaker 4>good that they were denying me getting </v>

2267
01:42:08.981 --> 01:42:13.981
<v Speaker 4>it like they didn't want.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And it wasn't because they were in love </v>

2268
01:42:13.981 --> 01:42:13.981
<v Speaker 4>with the pig.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're like,</v>

2269
01:42:13.981 --> 01:42:13.981
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2270
01:42:13.981 --> 01:42:13.981
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>
<v Speaker 4>no,</v>

2272
01:42:17.171 --> 01:42:17.171
<v Speaker 4>go.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And that was no good for you.</v>

2273
01:42:17.171 --> 01:42:17.680
<v Speaker 4>Maybe that was their,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that was their take taking more.</v>

2274
01:42:17.681 --> 01:42:20.110
<v Speaker 4>I,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I tend to like leaner meat anyway.</v>

2275
01:42:20.111 --> 01:42:22.840
<v Speaker 4>I really.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But I will tell you this,</v>

01:42:41.970 --> 01:42:44.431
<v Speaker 4>black bears that have been feeding on </v>
<v Speaker 4>salmon and what does that like dead </v>

2281
01:42:44.431 --> 01:42:44.431
<v Speaker 4>salmon.</v>

2282
01:42:44.980 --> 01:42:48.190
<v Speaker 4>It's like ryan's saying meat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The meat tastes like rotten salmon.</v>

2283
01:42:48.191 --> 01:42:49.600
<v Speaker 4>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Because I'm telling you man,</v>

2284
01:42:49.601 --> 01:42:54.601
<v Speaker 4>like the fat is so the fat does carries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a book on the side of the harold</v>

2285
01:42:56.681 --> 01:42:59.920
<v Speaker 4>mcgee's book on cooking science and lore</v>
<v Speaker 4>of the,</v>

2286
01:42:59.950 --> 01:43:01.420
<v Speaker 4>of cooking or science,</v>
<v Speaker 4>lower the kitchen.</v>

2287
01:43:01.421 --> 01:43:06.421
<v Speaker 4>He has an explanation there.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Why animal fat is such a reliable </v>

2288
01:43:06.421 --> 01:43:11.210
<v Speaker 4>indicator of what the animal's been up </v>
<v Speaker 4>to and I should read that on your own.</v>

2289
01:43:11.230 --> 01:43:13.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Refer your listeners to that rather than</v>

2290
01:43:13.151 --> 01:43:18.151
<v Speaker 4>try to explain it myself,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but you get on your show when you van </v>

2291
01:43:18.151 --> 01:43:21.890
<v Speaker 4>bear with that and eaten blue runner as </v>
<v Speaker 4>it's just like unbelievable and you can </v>

2292
01:43:21.890 --> 01:43:25.561
<v Speaker 4>just drink the fat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You can melt the fat and drink and it </v>

2293
01:43:25.561 --> 01:43:25.561
<v Speaker 4>tastes good.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now the fat on a salmon berry,</v>

2294
01:43:25.561 --> 01:43:30.320
<v Speaker 4>you really have to carefully,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and this is in the spring when they </v>

2295
01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:31.810
<v Speaker 4>haven't actually eaten a salmon in six </v>
<v Speaker 4>months or something yet.</v>

2296
01:43:31.840 --> 01:43:35.890
<v Speaker 4>The very carefully trim that fat away.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then the flesh becomes more palatable,</v>

2297
01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:39.430
<v Speaker 4>but it's just like kind of atrocious.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I got a friend of Montana,</v>

2298
01:43:39.431 --> 01:43:42.400
<v Speaker 4>he shot a bear over overwrought and </v>
<v Speaker 4>cowen time.</v>

2299
01:43:43.300 --> 01:43:44.860
<v Speaker 4>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He thought it was nearlY inevitable.</v>

2300
01:43:45.670 --> 01:43:48.070
<v Speaker 4>So what do you do when that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>when you have that situation,</v>

2301
01:43:48.071 --> 01:43:50.380
<v Speaker 4>do you continue to eat the animal jam </v>
<v Speaker 4>and respect?</v>

2302
01:43:50.410 --> 01:43:52.370
<v Speaker 4>Like if something.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If I'm eating meat,</v>

2303
01:43:52.371 --> 01:43:53.780
<v Speaker 4>that's great.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

2304
01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:58.840
<v Speaker 4>Super high quality meat.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I cook it in a high quality way where I </v>

2305
01:43:58.840 --> 01:43:59.050
<v Speaker 4>do as little as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll take a lot like,</v>

2306
01:43:59.060 --> 01:44:01.220
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we ate some pretty straight up meat when</v>

2307
01:44:01.221 --> 01:44:02.950
<v Speaker 4>we were out,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

2308
01:44:03.710 --> 01:44:08.630
<v Speaker 4>Like just like me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>malicious to warm with salt on it,</v>

2309
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:09.850
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so a good meal.</v>

2310
01:44:09.860 --> 01:44:12.410
<v Speaker 4>I'll do that if I get an animal that's </v>
<v Speaker 4>funky.</v>

2311
01:44:12.430 --> 01:44:15.020
<v Speaker 4>I and I killed it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I killed a female pig one time.</v>

2312
01:44:15.020 --> 01:44:17.240
<v Speaker 4>That was probably one of the worst game </v>
<v Speaker 4>animals I've ever done.</v>

2313
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:18.560
<v Speaker 4>A,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm just going to eat it.</v>

2314
01:44:18.710 --> 01:44:20.810
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like for me,</v>

2315
01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:24.890
<v Speaker 4>any displeasure I experienced eating </v>
<v Speaker 4>off,</v>

2316
01:44:24.891 --> 01:44:29.891
<v Speaker 4>tasting flesh isn't as bad as the </v>
<v Speaker 4>displeasure that I would experience from</v>

2317
01:44:30.140 --> 01:44:34.070
<v Speaker 4>having killed a big game animal and not </v>
<v Speaker 4>consumed.</v>

2318
01:44:34.130 --> 01:44:39.130
<v Speaker 4>That's a very great statement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So I'm going to eat it and then whether </v>

2319
01:44:39.130 --> 01:44:40.490
<v Speaker 4>I make pepperoni sticks,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if it's bad,</v>

2320
01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.930
<v Speaker 4>I make pepperoni sticks.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I eat thing,</v>

2321
01:44:44.100 --> 01:44:45.920
<v Speaker 4>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And I haven't always done it.</v>

2322
01:44:45.921 --> 01:44:48.710
<v Speaker 4>Like I explained to you many times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I used a lot of fur trapping,</v>

2323
01:44:49.210 --> 01:44:54.210
<v Speaker 4>sell animal furs,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now at this point in my life and </v>

2324
01:44:54.210 --> 01:44:55.310
<v Speaker 4>like my relationship with the hunting,</v>
<v Speaker 4>now I,</v>

2325
01:44:56.180 --> 01:44:58.310
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like to eat what I hunt for,</v>

2326
01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:00.880
<v Speaker 4>to the point.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean we ate a coyote not long ago down</v>

2327
01:45:00.881 --> 01:45:01.400
<v Speaker 4>in Mexico.</v>

2328
01:45:03.150 --> 01:45:08.150
<v Speaker 2>How you're the only person on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>planet.</v>

2329
01:45:08.430 --> 01:45:10.210
<v Speaker 2>I did this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's great about the podcast,</v>

2330
01:45:10.540 --> 01:45:15.540
<v Speaker 2>and we had this weird as saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I killed people sometimes.</v>

2331
01:45:18.740 --> 01:45:20.560
<v Speaker 2>Oh my god,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't you eat a coyote?</v>

2332
01:45:20.600 --> 01:45:25.600
<v Speaker 2>That's great people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So often I get it</v>

2333
01:45:27.460 --> 01:45:32.460
<v Speaker 4>asked like as the guide is eating stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I get asked all the time like what is it</v>

2334
01:45:32.501 --> 01:45:33.760
<v Speaker 4>like to eat this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>eat that.</v>

2335
01:45:34.300 --> 01:45:39.300
<v Speaker 4>And I have field the question about </v>
<v Speaker 4>what's kyle's so many times that I </v>

2336
01:45:39.671 --> 01:45:41.740
<v Speaker 4>started to feel like it was </v>
<v Speaker 4>professional,</v>

2337
01:45:42.190 --> 01:45:45.580
<v Speaker 4>like malfeasance for me to not have a </v>
<v Speaker 4>good answer,</v>

2338
01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:46.870
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2339
01:45:47.550 --> 01:45:49.890
<v Speaker 2>national malfeasance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've not have a good answer.</v>

2340
01:45:49.891 --> 01:45:51.860
<v Speaker 2>What a fucking coYote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's like</v>

2341
01:45:52.380 --> 01:45:56.950
<v Speaker 4>as professional development I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 4>know and we got a coyote and a.</v>

2342
01:45:56.990 --> 01:46:01.350
<v Speaker 4>So you have to eat the whole coyote now </v>
<v Speaker 4>in your mind you we ate like,</v>

2343
01:46:01.380 --> 01:46:06.380
<v Speaker 4>well there's a handful of us there and </v>
<v Speaker 4>we put the vast majority of that thing </v>

2344
01:46:06.380 --> 01:46:06.740
<v Speaker 4>down and</v>

2345
01:46:07.370 --> 01:46:11.370
<v Speaker 2>that has been burned the hair off.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

2346
01:46:11.670 --> 01:46:12.990
<v Speaker 2>we burned all off it</v>

2347
01:46:13.110 --> 01:46:15.160
<v Speaker 4>and enroll enrolls.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

2348
01:46:15.210 --> 01:46:17.670
<v Speaker 4>It was skin on what it tastes like.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well I got a,</v>

2349
01:46:17.830 --> 01:46:22.830
<v Speaker 4>like the best description.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I steal this from my body ramey warrant.</v>

2350
01:46:23.311 --> 01:46:28.311
<v Speaker 4>I was homeless and ramey warrant tastes </v>
<v Speaker 4>that and this is the esoteric </v>

2351
01:46:28.311 --> 01:46:29.210
<v Speaker 4>comparison,</v>
<v Speaker 4>remy warren and tasted that.</v>

2352
01:46:29.580 --> 01:46:31.920
<v Speaker 4>He's a hunting guide and he said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

2353
01:46:32.430 --> 01:46:35.370
<v Speaker 4>it tastes like overcooked diver.</v>

2354
01:46:39.570 --> 01:46:42.770
<v Speaker 2>No know you explained this to us on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>trip to die.</v>

2355
01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:46.060
<v Speaker 2>There's diver ducks and floaters that </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a call.</v>

2356
01:46:46.061 --> 01:46:46.820
<v Speaker 2>The other ones?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

2357
01:46:46.990 --> 01:46:47.300
<v Speaker 2>like</v>

2358
01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:48.650
<v Speaker 4>a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like a non</v>

2359
01:46:50.030 --> 01:46:55.030
<v Speaker 8>a taxonomy would with docs.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It'd be like a puddle ducks and diver </v>

2360
01:46:56.401 --> 01:46:58.570
<v Speaker 8>ducks and,</v>
<v Speaker 8>or people call them dabbler duck.</v>

2361
01:46:58.571 --> 01:47:03.571
<v Speaker 8>So docs that don't go underwater to hunt</v>
<v Speaker 8>and the ducks that eat fish are the ones</v>

2362
01:47:04.351 --> 01:47:09.351
<v Speaker 8>who don't want divers eat a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Divers eat a lot more animal matter and </v>

2363
01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:12.090
<v Speaker 8>diver ducks and puddle ducks eat a lot </v>
<v Speaker 8>more vegetation.</v>

2364
01:47:12.320 --> 01:47:14.750
<v Speaker 1>You that expression and overcooked </v>
<v Speaker 1>diver.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I don't know what.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fuck this guy's a fucking over.</v>

<v Speaker 1>like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going To back man.</v>

2369
01:47:26.700 --> 01:47:30.751
<v Speaker 1>This tastes a lot like divert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

2370
01:47:31.650 --> 01:47:33.090
<v Speaker 1>You had a couple shots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2371
01:47:33.091 --> 01:47:33.750
<v Speaker 1>on the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2372
01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:34.780
<v Speaker 1>the show at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

2373
01:47:34.781 --> 01:47:35.950
<v Speaker 1>at pheasants too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2374
01:47:36.010 --> 01:47:38.630
<v Speaker 1>We couldn't quite get it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do they call those?</v>

2375
01:47:39.220 --> 01:47:42.790
<v Speaker 1>Realize that some ducks are carnivorous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I never thought carnivorous</v>

2376
01:47:42.890 --> 01:47:45.740
<v Speaker 8>and even some puddle ducks,</v>
<v Speaker 8>some puddle.</v>

2377
01:47:45.750 --> 01:47:48.590
<v Speaker 8>Dr dabber dogs eat a lot of plant </v>
<v Speaker 8>matter,</v>

2378
01:47:48.591 --> 01:47:53.591
<v Speaker 8>so of the puddle ducks,</v>
<v Speaker 8>one of the like one of the not great </v>

2379
01:47:53.591 --> 01:47:56.510
<v Speaker 8>tasting ones as a northern shoveler in </v>
<v Speaker 8>northern shovelers.</v>

2380
01:47:56.600 --> 01:48:01.600
<v Speaker 8>Eat a lot of animal matter,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but you can take the bag like the best </v>

2381
01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:01.600
<v Speaker 8>duck on the planet in my mind,</v>
<v Speaker 8>be like,</v>

2382
01:48:01.600 --> 01:48:06.430
<v Speaker 8>I love mallard ducks,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but if you get mallard ducks in </v>

2383
01:48:06.430 --> 01:48:06.430
<v Speaker 8>southeast Alaska,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like near my cabin,</v>

2384
01:48:06.740 --> 01:48:10.040
<v Speaker 8>you can barely eat those mallard ducks </v>
<v Speaker 8>because even though they're mallards and</v>

2385
01:48:10.041 --> 01:48:12.410
<v Speaker 8>in most areas they taste great and </v>
<v Speaker 8>southeast Alaska,</v>

2386
01:48:12.411 --> 01:48:17.411
<v Speaker 8>those mallards in the in the late summer</v>
<v Speaker 8>or just sitting there hammering </v>

2387
01:48:17.411 --> 01:48:18.010
<v Speaker 8>invertebrates,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so they're.</v>

2388
01:48:18.011 --> 01:48:23.011
<v Speaker 8>ThEy're hunting the tide line,</v>
<v Speaker 8>eating expose invertebrates up and down </v>

2389
01:48:23.011 --> 01:48:24.710
<v Speaker 8>there and to get those docs and it </v>
<v Speaker 8>tastes like kyle.</v>

2390
01:48:27.070 --> 01:48:31.130
<v Speaker 1>They're eating invertebrates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning meaning a clam</v>

2391
01:48:32.110 --> 01:48:35.590
<v Speaker 8>little little insects and you know </v>
<v Speaker 8>people</v>

2392
01:48:35.700 --> 01:48:40.700
<v Speaker 1>who who don't understand modern methods </v>
<v Speaker 1>of farming and the way that animals are </v>

2393
01:48:41.470 --> 01:48:46.470
<v Speaker 1>fed and the foods that they're fed don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand the whole corn versus grass </v>

2394
01:48:46.470 --> 01:48:47.740
<v Speaker 1>fed debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's becoming such become a,</v>

2395
01:48:48.010 --> 01:48:53.010
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about so many times in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>podcast that people like hashtag things </v>

2396
01:48:53.010 --> 01:48:53.010
<v Speaker 1>grass fed when it has nothing to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

2397
01:48:53.010 --> 01:48:54.220
<v Speaker 1>They're just being silly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2398
01:48:54.221 --> 01:48:59.221
<v Speaker 1>but counselors are supposed to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking grass and when you give a </v>

2399
01:48:59.221 --> 01:48:59.410
<v Speaker 1>counselor corn it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole thing is,</v>

2400
01:48:59.470 --> 01:49:01.440
<v Speaker 1>it's like giving a person that corn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

2401
01:49:01.660 --> 01:49:03.820
<v Speaker 1>Like we get fat as fuck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2402
01:49:03.830 --> 01:49:05.290
<v Speaker 1>cows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>syrup and shit.</v>

2403
01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:10.090
<v Speaker 1>That's why they have four stomachs or </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it is to break down that grass.</v>

2404
01:49:10.130 --> 01:49:12.790
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet you the corn doesn't grow as good.</v>

2405
01:49:12.820 --> 01:49:15.310
<v Speaker 1>Magic mushrooms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a batch of the corn poop.</v>

2406
01:49:15.350 --> 01:49:20.350
<v Speaker 1>I bet it's a fucking mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not grass pumped through the </v>

2407
01:49:20.350 --> 01:49:20.910
<v Speaker 1>stomach of a double annually.</v>

2408
01:49:21.100 --> 01:49:23.920
<v Speaker 1>Cow corn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're using big words.</v>

2409
01:49:23.950 --> 01:49:28.570
<v Speaker 1>You used to wear a poor fucker eating </v>
<v Speaker 1>corn grown abscesses in his body.</v>

2410
01:49:28.780 --> 01:49:29.940
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever seen that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>A food.</v>

2411
01:49:30.220 --> 01:49:31.960
<v Speaker 1>That's why they have to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They grow their livers.</v>

2412
01:49:31.961 --> 01:49:36.961
<v Speaker 1>Abscess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they have to give them an </v>

2413
01:49:36.961 --> 01:49:36.961
<v Speaker 1>antibiotic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

2414
01:49:36.961 --> 01:49:36.961
<v Speaker 1>goddamn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's delicious.</v>

2415
01:49:36.961 --> 01:49:38.230
<v Speaker 1>That's a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so good.</v>

2416
01:49:38.231 --> 01:49:40.780
<v Speaker 1>A good ribeye,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fatty corn fed rib eye.</v>

2417
01:49:40.830 --> 01:49:43.300
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's perfect.</v>

2418
01:49:43.301 --> 01:49:46.390
<v Speaker 1>Like when I'm feeling healthy and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like grass fed,</v>

2419
01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:48.430
<v Speaker 1>I like grass fed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sirloin,</v>

2420
01:49:48.460 --> 01:49:49.680
<v Speaker 1>lean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

2421
01:49:50.620 --> 01:49:55.620
<v Speaker 1>but the best meat I've ever had in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>life was a grass fed with a corn fed rib</v>

2422
01:49:57.551 --> 01:50:00.940
<v Speaker 1>eye from whole foods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I cooked that and I'm telling you,</v>

2423
01:50:00.941 --> 01:50:03.740
<v Speaker 1>me and my buddy had it and it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just high.</v>

2424
01:50:04.250 --> 01:50:05.970
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was sober.</v>

2425
01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:10.240
<v Speaker 1>I think the best meat I've ever eaten in</v>
<v Speaker 1>my life was two things.</v>

2426
01:50:10.240 --> 01:50:12.560
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the liver and the heart of that,</v>

2427
01:50:12.610 --> 01:50:17.610
<v Speaker 1>that deer that we ate when we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting there by a campfire chopping up </v>

2428
01:50:17.610 --> 01:50:19.000
<v Speaker 1>and we had to cut around the bullet </v>
<v Speaker 1>hole.</v>

2429
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:24.030
<v Speaker 1>We were also angry though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'd spent three days eating those </v>

2430
01:50:24.030 --> 01:50:26.260
<v Speaker 1>bad mountain bath doesn't adopt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you,</v>

2431
01:50:26.261 --> 01:50:31.261
<v Speaker 1>I thought that those mountain bags,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to taste way worse than I </v>

2432
01:50:31.261 --> 01:50:31.261
<v Speaker 1>thought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought they were delicious.</v>

2433
01:50:31.261 --> 01:50:32.360
<v Speaker 1>It's situational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

2434
01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:34.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not as good as the meat.</v>

2435
01:50:34.390 --> 01:50:35.290
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We work with a guy.</v>

2436
01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:36.740
<v Speaker 1>We were a good guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And um,</v>

2437
01:50:37.100 --> 01:50:38.740
<v Speaker 1>he's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care about food.</v>

2438
01:50:39.010 --> 01:50:42.550
<v Speaker 1>I just want to be full and then go do </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I want to do,</v>

2439
01:50:43.090 --> 01:50:44.980
<v Speaker 1>and so he's always talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

2440
01:50:44.981 --> 01:50:49.981
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be home and I'll be home and I'll </v>

2441
01:50:49.981 --> 01:50:49.981
<v Speaker 1>eat freeze dried food because it's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>more efficient for me.</v>

2442
01:50:49.981 --> 01:50:52.060
<v Speaker 1>I just want to be done and then go do </v>
<v Speaker 1>what I want to do.</v>

2443
01:50:52.150 --> 01:50:57.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can understand being obsessed with </v>

2444
01:50:57.150 --> 01:50:57.150
<v Speaker 1>something else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

2445
01:50:57.150 --> 01:50:57.580
<v Speaker 1>you can enjoy food as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2446

2450
01:51:07.801 --> 01:51:09.391
<v Speaker 1>accident and he lost his sense of smell </v>
<v Speaker 1>and taste and he doesn't care that much </v>

2451
01:51:09.391 --> 01:51:14.071
<v Speaker 1>about food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That dude probably eats ass like a </v>

2507
01:53:42.491 --> 01:53:47.491
<v Speaker 4>I don't know what to do with them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'll give them to the animal lovers at </v>

2508
01:53:47.491 --> 01:53:48.790
<v Speaker 4>peta.</v>
<v Speaker 4>These dogs die like most of them</v>

2509
01:53:48.920 --> 01:53:51.380
<v Speaker 5>they put down because they have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>because they don't have the resources to</v>

2510
01:53:51.381 --> 01:53:55.880
<v Speaker 5>take care of those dogs,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that doesn't matter when you,</v>

2511
01:53:55.910 --> 01:54:00.910
<v Speaker 5>when you're looking at,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I don't care if you don't have the </v>

2512
01:54:00.910 --> 01:54:00.910
<v Speaker 5>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're killing puppies and cats.</v>

2513
01:54:00.910 --> 01:54:01.730
<v Speaker 5>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and by the way,</v>

2514
01:54:01.731 --> 01:54:05.030
<v Speaker 5>you try to keep it secret to you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Don't go advertising and telling people,</v>

2515
01:54:05.031 --> 01:54:05.600
<v Speaker 5>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 5>listen,</v>

2516
01:54:05.810 --> 01:54:08.080
<v Speaker 5>if you don't come down and take these </v>
<v Speaker 5>things as pads,</v>

2517
01:54:08.081 --> 01:54:09.170
<v Speaker 5>we're going to kill them.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

2518
01:54:09.230 --> 01:54:12.170
<v Speaker 5>you're doing it on the sneak tip and </v>
<v Speaker 5>people have to find out about it through</v>

2519
01:54:12.171 --> 01:54:17.171
<v Speaker 5>the internet and then on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're criticizing people that are </v>

2520
01:54:17.171 --> 01:54:20.771
<v Speaker 5>hunting and feeding their family with </v>
<v Speaker 5>what they know to be a really healthy </v>

2521
01:54:20.771 --> 01:54:23.780
<v Speaker 5>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Instead of this mystery fucking chain of</v>

2522
01:54:23.781 --> 01:54:28.781
<v Speaker 5>command that happens when you buy a </v>
<v Speaker 5>cheeseburger from burger king or </v>

2523
01:54:28.781 --> 01:54:31.850
<v Speaker 5>wherever with name your fast food joint.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Who knows what the fuck happened to that</v>

2524
01:54:31.851 --> 01:54:34.910
<v Speaker 5>cow before it was converted into </v>
<v Speaker 5>cheeseburgers?</v>

2525
01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:36.710
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you don't know a goddamn thing,</v>

2526
01:54:36.860 --> 01:54:41.860
<v Speaker 5>but the fact that they would go after </v>
<v Speaker 5>one while killing puppies and kittens,</v>

2527
01:54:41.871 --> 01:54:43.250
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's insanity.</v>

2528
01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:45.500
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that is insanity.</v>

2529
01:54:46.020 --> 01:54:48.270
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a thing that rings false to me.</v>

2530
01:54:48.450 --> 01:54:49.710
<v Speaker 4>And,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and you know,</v>

2531
01:54:49.820 --> 01:54:51.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm walking on like I got,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I got,</v>

2532
01:54:51.261 --> 01:54:54.060
<v Speaker 4>I got to tread delicately here on the </v>
<v Speaker 4>issue of,</v>

2533
01:54:54.100 --> 01:54:54.860
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of,</v>

2534
01:54:55.050 --> 01:54:57.130
<v Speaker 4>of the helicopter thing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hm.</v>

2535
01:54:57.330 --> 01:54:57.610
<v Speaker 4>But</v>

2536
01:54:58.710 --> 01:55:00.340
<v Speaker 1>well no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the awesomeness of it.</v>

2537
01:55:00.370 --> 01:55:02.590
<v Speaker 1>One thing that rings false to me though </v>
<v Speaker 1>is when</v>

2538
01:55:02.710 --> 01:55:07.710
<v Speaker 4>guys like when guys do so hard to cook,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like no matter what you think,</v>

2539
01:55:09.940 --> 01:55:14.940
<v Speaker 4>it's like dan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you do damned if you don't try to go </v>

2540
01:55:14.940 --> 01:55:14.940
<v Speaker 4>for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When someone does,</v>

2541
01:55:14.940 --> 01:55:18.920
<v Speaker 4>if someone goes out and shoots a bunch </v>
<v Speaker 4>of something because it's there,</v>

2542
01:55:18.930 --> 01:55:23.930
<v Speaker 4>they're overpopulated for a rancher.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like in some way you have to be </v>

2543
01:55:23.930 --> 01:55:28.210
<v Speaker 4>self honest to and acknowledge that </v>
<v Speaker 4>you're not just doing an altruistic act.</v>

2544
01:55:28.650 --> 01:55:30.310
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like I enjoy the hunt,</v>

2545
01:55:30.370 --> 01:55:35.370
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so when I have my body's ranch in </v>

2546
01:55:35.370 --> 01:55:37.771
<v Speaker 4>California,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm glad that he figures he has too many</v>

2547
01:55:38.051 --> 01:55:43.051
<v Speaker 4>pics because it allows me to go pig </v>
<v Speaker 4>hunting and I liked to go pig,</v>

2548
01:55:43.590 --> 01:55:44.070
<v Speaker 4>I like to</v>

2549
01:55:44.130 --> 01:55:46.530
<v Speaker 8>eat pigs,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but I would never like,</v>

2550
01:55:46.620 --> 01:55:48.570
<v Speaker 8>I don't then say to my wife,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm like,</v>

2551
01:55:48.630 --> 01:55:50.790
<v Speaker 8>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I really don't want to do it,</v>

2552
01:55:51.570 --> 01:55:56.570
<v Speaker 8>but my body's in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He's got a lot of pigs and I'm going to </v>

2553
01:55:56.570 --> 01:56:01.041
<v Speaker 8>go out and as much as it's going to be a</v>
<v Speaker 8>drag I'm going to go out and help him </v>

2554
01:56:01.041 --> 01:56:04.650
<v Speaker 8>because we need to fight our way through</v>
<v Speaker 8>this pig problem and we all need to give</v>

2555
01:56:04.651 --> 01:56:07.050
<v Speaker 8>our share because if my buddy had called</v>
<v Speaker 8>me and said,</v>

2556
01:56:07.051 --> 01:56:12.051
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I got a real problem with my fences are </v>

2557
01:56:12.051 --> 01:56:14.241
<v Speaker 8>down.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Can you come out and spend a weekend </v>

2558
01:56:14.241 --> 01:56:16.821
<v Speaker 8>fixing all my fences?</v>
<v Speaker 8>That really is the problem I have right </v>

2559
01:56:16.821 --> 01:56:16.821
<v Speaker 8>now.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'd be like,</v>

2560
01:56:16.821 --> 01:56:16.821
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>

2561
01:56:17.440 --> 01:56:20.760
<v Speaker 5>What are those pigs up to you having a </v>
<v Speaker 5>problem with them?</v>

2562
01:56:22.310 --> 01:56:24.190
<v Speaker 5>It's natural to.</v>
<v Speaker 5>First of all,</v>

2563
01:56:24.850 --> 01:56:29.850
<v Speaker 5>the hunting them is natural and the </v>
<v Speaker 5>dealing with the overpopulation is a </v>

2564
01:56:29.850 --> 01:56:32.950
<v Speaker 5>real issue for people that do have farms</v>
<v Speaker 5>and do have ranches like you got to deal</v>

2565
01:56:32.951 --> 01:56:37.951
<v Speaker 5>with that and to get bullshit to take,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to take crap from people that are </v>

2566
01:56:37.951 --> 01:56:38.800
<v Speaker 5>killing puppies and kittens like,</v>
<v Speaker 5>man,</v>

2567
01:56:38.801 --> 01:56:40.330
<v Speaker 5>we need to come to an understanding </v>
<v Speaker 5>here.</v>

2568
01:56:40.331 --> 01:56:42.210
<v Speaker 5>Here's the real issue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's not pizza.</v>

2569
01:56:42.400 --> 01:56:44.710
<v Speaker 5>It's not the problem of being ethical </v>
<v Speaker 5>towards animals.</v>

2570
01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:50.280
<v Speaker 5>It's crazy assholes that do illogical </v>
<v Speaker 5>shit and that's the problem with a lot </v>

2571
01:56:51.221 --> 01:56:56.221
<v Speaker 5>of animal activist.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's the problem with a lot of people </v>

2572
01:56:56.221 --> 01:56:56.500
<v Speaker 5>that claim to love animals more than </v>
<v Speaker 5>they love people.</v>

2573
01:56:56.740 --> 01:57:01.740
<v Speaker 5>You're out of your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you love a dog more than you love </v>

2574
01:57:01.740 --> 01:57:01.740
<v Speaker 5>people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you're out of your mind,</v>

2575
01:57:01.740 --> 01:57:02.890
<v Speaker 5>your body,</v>
<v Speaker 5>your mind you.</v>

2576
01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:05.290
<v Speaker 5>That's a one way relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Jesus christ,</v>

2577
01:57:05.380 --> 01:57:07.470
<v Speaker 5>that thing doesn't talk to you about </v>
<v Speaker 5>stuff.</v>

2578
01:57:07.471 --> 01:57:11.020
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't challenge you on issues.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't tell you it loves you.</v>

2579
01:57:11.021 --> 01:57:15.100
<v Speaker 5>It doesn't help you grow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's goddamn dog and I love my dogs,</v>

2580
01:57:15.250 --> 01:57:19.210
<v Speaker 5>but you're crazy if you like animals </v>
<v Speaker 5>more than people and the people that are</v>

2581
01:57:19.211 --> 01:57:22.390
<v Speaker 5>involved on a,</v>
<v Speaker 5>just for whatever reason,</v>

2582
01:57:22.391 --> 01:57:24.220
<v Speaker 5>there's a certain percentage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not all of them,</v>

2583
01:57:24.520 --> 01:57:29.520
<v Speaker 5>but a certain percentage of people that </v>
<v Speaker 5>are involved in animal rights movements </v>

2584
01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:33.480
<v Speaker 5>have a distorted perception of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>relationship between humans and animals </v>

2585
01:57:33.940 --> 01:57:36.790
<v Speaker 5>and their relationship is not one of </v>
<v Speaker 5>admiration and respect.</v>

2586
01:57:36.970 --> 01:57:38.410
<v Speaker 5>It becomes what you were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 5>though.</v>

2587
01:57:38.411 --> 01:57:42.120
<v Speaker 5>The anthropomorphic sort of a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like it's bambi or it's like,</v>

2588
01:57:42.130 --> 01:57:44.950
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I saw someone who was talking about when</v>

2589
01:57:44.951 --> 01:57:46.480
<v Speaker 5>the mountain lion got shot in santa </v>
<v Speaker 5>monica,</v>

2590
01:57:47.010 --> 01:57:49.090
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they should fucking shoot people.</v>

2591
01:57:49.180 --> 01:57:52.150
<v Speaker 5>I'd be happier if some,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a person was shot and that mountain lion</v>

2592
01:57:52.370 --> 01:57:55.450
<v Speaker 5>like that was on the mountain lion in </v>
<v Speaker 5>fucking santa monica.</v>

2593
01:57:55.451 --> 01:57:58.300
<v Speaker 5>Man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Santa monica is really urban.</v>

2594
01:57:58.301 --> 01:57:58.990
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2595
01:57:58.991 --> 01:58:01.210
<v Speaker 5>There's no parks,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there's no parks.</v>

2596
01:58:01.211 --> 01:58:03.940
<v Speaker 5>There's no giant places where there's </v>
<v Speaker 5>all trees.</v>

2597
01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.220
<v Speaker 5>There's no central park in santa monica.</v>

2598
01:58:06.470 --> 01:58:11.470
<v Speaker 8>Years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 8>few years ago there was a black bear in </v>

2599
01:58:11.470 --> 01:58:11.470
<v Speaker 8>bergen county,</v>
<v Speaker 8>New Jersey.</v>

2600
01:58:11.470 --> 01:58:14.260
<v Speaker 8>Do you remember that?</v>
<v Speaker 8>North jersey and same thing.</v>

2601
01:58:14.740 --> 01:58:18.340
<v Speaker 8>That's what joey diaz is,</v>

2604
01:58:23.350 --> 01:58:26.020
<v Speaker 8>Fuck.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Where are you from?</v>

2605
01:58:26.170 --> 01:58:28.630
<v Speaker 8>Oklahoma.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Jesus christ.</v>

2606
01:58:28.900 --> 01:58:30.640
<v Speaker 8>Sorry about that.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Might be for North Korea.</v>

2607
01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:35.110
<v Speaker 8>What is your background?</v>
<v Speaker 8>So infiltrated our defensive.</v>

2608
01:58:35.140 --> 01:58:37.240
<v Speaker 8>So here's,</v>
<v Speaker 8>here's my excuse for how I mispronounced</v>

2609
01:58:37.260 --> 01:58:38.350
<v Speaker 8>what does it?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Hoboken.</v>

2610
01:58:38.351 --> 01:58:40.530
<v Speaker 8>Hoboken,</v>
<v Speaker 8>hoboken says New York times.</v>

2611
01:58:40.540 --> 01:58:41.890
<v Speaker 8>So I've got a little bit of a,</v>

2612
01:58:42.070 --> 01:58:44.890
<v Speaker 7>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>a beef with hoboken because when I was a</v>

2613
01:58:44.891 --> 01:58:46.930
<v Speaker 7>kid I lived in ridgewood,</v>
<v Speaker 7>New Jersey for a year.</v>

2614
01:58:47.410 --> 01:58:52.410
<v Speaker 7>Ridgewood had a law on the books that </v>
<v Speaker 7>said you can actually not play video </v>

2615
01:58:52.410 --> 01:58:55.591
<v Speaker 7>games until you were 16 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There was a ban on video games in </v>

2616
01:58:55.591 --> 01:58:55.591
<v Speaker 7>ridgewood,</v>
<v Speaker 7>New Jersey.</v>

2617
01:58:55.600 --> 01:59:00.600
<v Speaker 7>So as an eight year old in north jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I had to go to hoboken to a diner to </v>

2618
01:59:01.241 --> 01:59:05.320
<v Speaker 7>play a german version of pac man.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So when I think of hoboken,</v>

2619
01:59:05.321 --> 01:59:06.520
<v Speaker 7>I don't really think of how to pronounce</v>
<v Speaker 7>it.</v>

2620
01:59:06.521 --> 01:59:11.521
<v Speaker 7>I just think of my,</v>
<v Speaker 7>my fond memories of a german version of </v>

2621
01:59:11.521 --> 01:59:11.740
<v Speaker 7>pac man with the name of the ghosts were</v>
<v Speaker 7>like,</v>

2622
01:59:11.741 --> 01:59:15.990
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 7>18 characters long and you know,</v>

2623
01:59:16.330 --> 01:59:18.490
<v Speaker 7>so that's the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think diners,</v>

2624
01:59:18.491 --> 01:59:23.491
<v Speaker 7>I think black bears,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think pac man think hoboken and joe </v>

2625
01:59:23.491 --> 01:59:23.980
<v Speaker 7>rogan will kick my ass if I ever missed.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So there's the issue,</v>

2626
01:59:24.220 --> 01:59:25.900
<v Speaker 5>there was a bear in that area</v>

2627
01:59:26.480 --> 01:59:31.480
<v Speaker 7>there.</v>
<v Speaker 7>There've been bear sightings in every </v>

2628
01:59:31.480 --> 01:59:31.480
<v Speaker 7>county in New Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 7>every county in New Jersey.</v>

2629
01:59:31.570 --> 01:59:35.080
<v Speaker 5>And they just made bear hunting legal in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the last half a decade or so.</v>

2630
01:59:35.100 --> 01:59:35.900
<v Speaker 7>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Yeah,</v>

2631
01:59:35.901 --> 01:59:38.030
<v Speaker 7>it was illegal for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They brought it back.</v>

2632
01:59:38.060 --> 01:59:41.030
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 7>and then when a couple of years ago when</v>

2633
01:59:41.031 --> 01:59:46.031
<v Speaker 7>core zine was governor,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they put a stop to it again over the </v>

2634
01:59:46.031 --> 01:59:47.200
<v Speaker 7>objections of the wildlife commission.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're in the state.</v>

2635
01:59:47.240 --> 01:59:50.330
<v Speaker 5>And how do you get wildlife commissions?</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what drives me crazy.</v>

2636
01:59:50.510 --> 01:59:55.510
<v Speaker 5>How do you get wildlife commissions that</v>
<v Speaker 5>are run by people who are animal rights </v>

2637
01:59:55.510 --> 01:59:57.890
<v Speaker 5>activists and why does that happen?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And how is that possible that,</v>

2638
01:59:57.891 --> 01:59:58.330
<v Speaker 5>that happened?</v>

2639
01:59:58.380 --> 02:00:00.320
<v Speaker 7>You got it in California right now </v>
<v Speaker 7>because you know,</v>

2640
02:00:00.440 --> 02:00:02.900
<v Speaker 7>the governor,</v>
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>

2641
02:00:02.980 --> 02:00:07.980
<v Speaker 7>points so many people and they're going </v>
<v Speaker 7>to have so many hunters and now they're </v>

2642
02:00:07.980 --> 02:00:08.530
<v Speaker 7>gonna bring a,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you know,</v>

2643
02:00:08.550 --> 02:00:09.210
<v Speaker 7>they're going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 7>well,</v>

2644
02:00:09.211 --> 02:00:10.860
<v Speaker 7>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so the 100 is get a seat at the table,</v>

2645
02:00:11.070 --> 02:00:16.070
<v Speaker 7>but we also have to have the animal </v>
<v Speaker 7>rights activists have a seat at the </v>

2646
02:00:16.070 --> 02:00:16.070
<v Speaker 7>table too.</v>

2647
02:00:16.070 --> 02:00:18.570
<v Speaker 5>But the idea that they're trying to mean</v>
<v Speaker 5>an animal rights activist,</v>

2648
02:00:18.571 --> 02:00:20.190
<v Speaker 5>it's automatically going to be anti </v>
<v Speaker 5>hunting.</v>

2649
02:00:20.220 --> 02:00:21.260
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Absolutely.</v>

2650
02:00:22.080 --> 02:00:27.080
<v Speaker 5>It just doesn't make any sense that </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone could be in charge of wildlife </v>

2651
02:00:27.080 --> 02:00:27.600
<v Speaker 5>management.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It'd be anti hunting.</v>

2652
02:00:27.601 --> 02:00:30.090
<v Speaker 5>That sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's what that is,</v>

2653
02:00:30.091 --> 02:00:34.530
<v Speaker 5>is this convenient ignorance that a lot </v>
<v Speaker 5>of people that don't understand wildlife</v>

2654
02:00:34.590 --> 02:00:35.770
<v Speaker 5>have.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And I,</v>

2655
02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:38.810
<v Speaker 5>I didn't until I started getting into it</v>
<v Speaker 5>before I started paying attention,</v>

2656
02:00:38.850 --> 02:00:43.850
<v Speaker 5>whatever it was,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a decade started paying wildlife </v>

2657
02:00:43.850 --> 02:00:45.840
<v Speaker 5>management councils,</v>
<v Speaker 5>et cetera,</v>

2658
02:00:45.850 --> 02:00:50.280
<v Speaker 5>have done a pretty good job of doing </v>
<v Speaker 5>their job.</v>

2659
02:00:50.730 --> 02:00:52.680
<v Speaker 5>And I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 5>not in liberal states though.</v>

2660
02:00:52.710 --> 02:00:54.990
<v Speaker 5>The issue is when states,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like in California,</v>

2661
02:00:54.991 --> 02:00:59.991
<v Speaker 5>where they're making logical decisions </v>
<v Speaker 5>like the lack of dogs and black bear and</v>

2662
02:01:00.001 --> 02:01:05.001
<v Speaker 5>in a mountain lion hunts,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're hard enough to fucking kill and </v>

2663
02:01:05.001 --> 02:01:06.480
<v Speaker 5>to control the population and especially</v>
<v Speaker 5>when you're dealing with predators,</v>

2664
02:01:06.690 --> 02:01:11.690
<v Speaker 5>like you have a responsibility as a </v>
<v Speaker 5>human being to keep the population in </v>

2665
02:01:11.690 --> 02:01:16.551
<v Speaker 5>control.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not saying you should run them to </v>

2666
02:01:16.551 --> 02:01:16.551
<v Speaker 5>the point of extinction,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but you have.</v>

2667
02:01:16.551 --> 02:01:18.900
<v Speaker 5>I think every human in a community has </v>
<v Speaker 5>a,</v>

2668
02:01:18.960 --> 02:01:21.840
<v Speaker 5>if,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if possible to control predators.</v>

2669
02:01:21.870 --> 02:01:23.100
<v Speaker 5>You should.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There should.</v>

2670
02:01:23.130 --> 02:01:25.980
<v Speaker 5>There's a responsibility to keep a </v>
<v Speaker 5>certain,</v>

2671
02:01:26.550 --> 02:01:31.550
<v Speaker 5>a certain amount of control on the </v>
<v Speaker 5>situation and when you start doing shit </v>

2672
02:01:31.550 --> 02:01:31.550
<v Speaker 5>like saying,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

2673
02:01:31.550 --> 02:01:34.380
<v Speaker 5>you can't hunting with dogs or you can't</v>
<v Speaker 5>do this or you can't do that,</v>

2674
02:01:34.650 --> 02:01:35.820
<v Speaker 5>you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you what?</v>

2675
02:01:35.821 --> 02:01:36.900
<v Speaker 5>You should be.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What should be as.</v>

2676
02:01:36.901 --> 02:01:38.850
<v Speaker 5>How many numbers are they killing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

2677
02:01:39.080 --> 02:01:39.980
<v Speaker 5>And there's not a</v>

2678
02:01:39.980 --> 02:01:42.410
<v Speaker 2>lot of mountain lions getting killed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not easy to do.</v>

2679
02:01:42.680 --> 02:01:44.000
<v Speaker 2>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not in danger,</v>

2680
02:01:44.001 --> 02:01:44.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

2681
02:01:45.200 --> 02:01:46.100
<v Speaker 2>not dangerous anymore.</v>

2682
02:01:47.090 --> 02:01:50.630
<v Speaker 4>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Now you're seeing an expansion and range</v>

2683
02:01:50.670 --> 02:01:55.670
<v Speaker 4>and it's different than what people </v>
<v Speaker 4>think because some of the states that </v>

2684
02:01:55.670 --> 02:02:00.431
<v Speaker 4>have the most heavy hunting for mountain</v>
<v Speaker 4>lions are actually turning out to be </v>

2685
02:02:00.861 --> 02:02:05.330
<v Speaker 4>areas that are population sources,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so there's a movement right now was just</v>

2686
02:02:05.331 --> 02:02:10.331
<v Speaker 4>reading this paper recently where they </v>
<v Speaker 4>were doing some work on lines and they </v>

2687
02:02:10.331 --> 02:02:14.220
<v Speaker 4>were thinking that with the abundance of</v>
<v Speaker 4>lions in California with the loss of </v>

2688
02:02:15.501 --> 02:02:20.501
<v Speaker 4>hound hunting that they would be seeing </v>
<v Speaker 4>californian lions going into phil </v>

2689
02:02:22.460 --> 02:02:27.460
<v Speaker 4>ecosystems vacated by harvested lines in</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nevada with their fine and instead is in</v>

2690
02:02:28.131 --> 02:02:33.131
<v Speaker 4>spite of all the basin and range country</v>
<v Speaker 4>in Nevada in spite of the hunting is </v>

2691
02:02:33.231 --> 02:02:38.231
<v Speaker 4>still able to produce lines and they're </v>
<v Speaker 4>seeing lions going in a different </v>

2692
02:02:38.231 --> 02:02:38.660
<v Speaker 4>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're seen lions going,</v>

2693
02:02:38.820 --> 02:02:43.820
<v Speaker 4>spreading out displaced young males </v>
<v Speaker 4>spreading out from Nevada into </v>

2694
02:02:43.820 --> 02:02:43.820
<v Speaker 4>California.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

2695
02:02:43.820 --> 02:02:48.250
<v Speaker 4>it could be two things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It could be somehow that their buddy </v>

2696
02:02:48.250 --> 02:02:49.040
<v Speaker 4>called him in from California and said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>dude,</v>

2697
02:02:49.041 --> 02:02:49.760
<v Speaker 4>come here.</v>

2698
02:02:51.260 --> 02:02:53.670
<v Speaker 2>They will not mess with you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These people are soft.</v>

2699
02:02:54.080 --> 02:02:57.420
<v Speaker 2>I'd use dogs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know what it is,</v>

2700
02:02:57.421 --> 02:02:58.530
<v Speaker 2>but so much stuff</v>

2701
02:02:59.450 --> 02:03:04.450
<v Speaker 4>like there's always something that </v>
<v Speaker 4>violates all your expectations into the </v>

2702
02:03:04.450 --> 02:03:08.271
<v Speaker 4>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like do state fish and game agencies do </v>

2703
02:03:08.271 --> 02:03:08.271
<v Speaker 4>their job?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I have no one,</v>

2704
02:03:08.400 --> 02:03:13.400
<v Speaker 4>no one has complete faith in everything,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but in general I have a lot of faith in </v>

2705
02:03:15.180 --> 02:03:18.900
<v Speaker 4>state fish and game agencies and you </v>
<v Speaker 4>guys have all had the luxury,</v>

2706
02:03:18.960 --> 02:03:23.960
<v Speaker 4>like I have the travel around the world </v>
<v Speaker 4>a fair bit and I used to have this naive</v>

2707
02:03:24.361 --> 02:03:29.361
<v Speaker 4>idea that you'd go to a developing </v>
<v Speaker 4>nation and it would be that you'd </v>

2708
02:03:29.361 --> 02:03:32.640
<v Speaker 4>experienced this great abundance of </v>
<v Speaker 4>wildlife.</v>

2709
02:03:32.700 --> 02:03:34.020
<v Speaker 4>It's just in your mind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's like,</v>

2710
02:03:34.050 --> 02:03:36.690
<v Speaker 4>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like back in time somehow.</v>

2711
02:03:36.810 --> 02:03:38.070
<v Speaker 4>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I remember like the first time I went to</v>

2712
02:03:38.071 --> 02:03:39.780
<v Speaker 4>Philippines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Philippines do a magazine story.</v>

2713
02:03:39.781 --> 02:03:44.781
<v Speaker 4>I brought my snorkeling mask and I </v>
<v Speaker 4>thought it'd just be this explosion of </v>

2714
02:03:44.781 --> 02:03:45.240
<v Speaker 4>sea life,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>

2715
02:03:45.300 --> 02:03:50.300
<v Speaker 4>but in fact it's not because they use </v>
<v Speaker 4>cyanide to fish on the reefs and they go</v>

2716
02:03:52.501 --> 02:03:57.501
<v Speaker 4>to a fish market there and the fisher </v>
<v Speaker 4>and inch long tops or they or it's </v>

2717
02:03:57.501 --> 02:04:01.161
<v Speaker 4>either there's a bunch of inch long fish</v>
<v Speaker 4>or they've just jogged into big whale </v>

2718
02:04:01.161 --> 02:04:01.320
<v Speaker 4>shark and they're hacking the department</v>
<v Speaker 4>machetes.</v>

2719
02:04:01.350 --> 02:04:06.350
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So it's like the reality is is that the </v>

2720
02:04:06.350 --> 02:04:09.150
<v Speaker 4>us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have very progressive game management</v>

2721
02:04:09.690 --> 02:04:13.170
<v Speaker 4>and we have like a hundred base </v>
<v Speaker 4>management system in the us.</v>

2722
02:04:13.171 --> 02:04:15.360
<v Speaker 4>When you factor in how many people live </v>
<v Speaker 4>here,</v>

2723
02:04:15.570 --> 02:04:19.110
<v Speaker 4>where we're at in a technological sense </v>
<v Speaker 4>where we're at in an economic sense,</v>

2724
02:04:19.380 --> 02:04:22.500
<v Speaker 4>it almost doesn't make sense that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>have the wildlife we have,</v>

2725
02:04:22.560 --> 02:04:27.560
<v Speaker 4>we do a phenomenal job and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 4>richness of wildlife in the United </v>

2726
02:04:27.560 --> 02:04:30.090
<v Speaker 4>States of America that's unparalleled by</v>
<v Speaker 4>any country in a similar situation.</v>

2727
02:04:30.420 --> 02:04:31.850
<v Speaker 4>There's nothing to compare it to me.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Let me</v>

2728
02:04:31.850 --> 02:04:33.110
<v Speaker 2>pick it back and I don't want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>interrupt you,</v>

2729
02:04:33.111 --> 02:04:38.111
<v Speaker 2>but now you did the us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The us also has been really responsible </v>

2730
02:04:38.111 --> 02:04:38.111
<v Speaker 2>for many,</v>

2731
02:04:38.111 --> 02:04:39.120
<v Speaker 1>many years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

2732
02:04:39.490 --> 02:04:42.990
<v Speaker 1>and if you want to buy timber from say </v>
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia,</v>

2733
02:04:43.380 --> 02:04:48.380
<v Speaker 1>our rules and guidelines for how that </v>
<v Speaker 1>timber is harvested and where is </v>

2734
02:04:48.391 --> 02:04:52.380
<v Speaker 1>incredibly stringent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's countries like China and Japan that</v>

2735
02:04:52.381 --> 02:04:54.120
<v Speaker 1>are not responsible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but keep going.</v>

2736
02:04:54.180 --> 02:04:54.380
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

2737
02:04:54.460 --> 02:04:59.460
<v Speaker 4>You're right.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're absolutely right there and we've </v>

2738
02:04:59.460 --> 02:05:01.321
<v Speaker 4>had to use.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We've had used certain things to try to </v>

2739
02:05:01.321 --> 02:05:02.170
<v Speaker 4>control other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Abuse on the high seas,</v>

2740
02:05:02.171 --> 02:05:04.330
<v Speaker 4>like we'll even go after people and be </v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

2741
02:05:04.600 --> 02:05:09.600
<v Speaker 4>not only were you not by your fisheries,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but now we have the capability to </v>

2742
02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:09.600
<v Speaker 4>boycott your electronics.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Exactly.</v>

2743
02:05:09.600 --> 02:05:10.270
<v Speaker 4>If you're not going to get with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>program,</v>

2744
02:05:10.271 --> 02:05:15.271
<v Speaker 4>a high seas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fisheries management in general in the </v>

2745
02:05:15.271 --> 02:05:17.371
<v Speaker 4>us,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I attribute it gives us a start </v>

2746
02:05:17.371 --> 02:05:17.371
<v Speaker 4>installing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It starts selling a documentary,</v>

2747
02:05:17.371 --> 02:05:21.970
<v Speaker 4>but I'm saying that like the wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the north american wildlife conservation</v>

2748
02:05:21.971 --> 02:05:26.971
<v Speaker 4>model,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is a model based on creating </v>

2749
02:05:26.971 --> 02:05:29.971
<v Speaker 4>abundance so that you can have a limited</v>
<v Speaker 4>sustainable harvest of resources has </v>

2750
02:05:30.791 --> 02:05:35.260
<v Speaker 4>proven to be the best system and it's </v>
<v Speaker 4>not even debatable</v>

2751
02:05:35.500 --> 02:05:40.500
<v Speaker 1>and people don't understand that when </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're in urban areas and they become </v>

2752
02:05:40.500 --> 02:05:43.831
<v Speaker 1>animal rights activists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They talk about how much they love </v>

2753
02:05:43.831 --> 02:05:46.231
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't understand things like </v>

2754
02:05:46.231 --> 02:05:47.971
<v Speaker 1>keeping deer population down so you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't die in car accidents because they </v>

2755
02:05:47.971 --> 02:05:51.601
<v Speaker 1>don't have natural predators unless </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to go fucking like what </v>

2756
02:05:51.601 --> 02:05:54.871
<v Speaker 1>they're doing with wolves and </v>
<v Speaker 1>reintroduce wolves and deer and </v>

2757
02:05:54.871 --> 02:05:54.871
<v Speaker 1>ecosystem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then what happens?</v>

2758
02:05:54.871 --> 02:05:55.600
<v Speaker 1>What are you gonna control the wolves?</v>

2759
02:05:55.660 --> 02:05:58.480
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're not funding research,</v>

2760
02:05:58.830 --> 02:06:03.830
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like a guy that wants and he buys </v>

2761
02:06:03.830 --> 02:06:06.630
<v Speaker 4>firearms and ammunition,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which has a federal law which has </v>

2762
02:06:06.630 --> 02:06:08.230
<v Speaker 4>essentially a self imposed excise tax.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was voted in by sportsman.</v>

2763
02:06:08.250 --> 02:06:10.060
<v Speaker 4>They have cell phones pose,</v>
<v Speaker 4>excise tax,</v>

2764
02:06:10.500 --> 02:06:12.130
<v Speaker 4>where money goes to the federal </v>
<v Speaker 4>government.</v>

2765
02:06:12.730 --> 02:06:15.100
<v Speaker 4>It's a percentage that goes to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>federal government that purchase.</v>

2766
02:06:15.370 --> 02:06:17.320
<v Speaker 4>It's earmarked for wildlife </v>
<v Speaker 4>conservation,</v>

2767
02:06:17.321 --> 02:06:19.660
<v Speaker 4>so you're talking about enforcement of </v>
<v Speaker 4>laws,</v>

2768
02:06:19.780 --> 02:06:24.780
<v Speaker 4>which I think peter would agree with </v>
<v Speaker 4>greatly that someone needs to enforce </v>

2769
02:06:24.780 --> 02:06:24.780
<v Speaker 4>these laws.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That's how.</v>

2770
02:06:24.780 --> 02:06:25.390
<v Speaker 4>That's how we're funding that.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In forest went hunting,</v>

2771
02:06:25.391 --> 02:06:28.330
<v Speaker 4>license sales and pittman robertson act </v>
<v Speaker 4>funds.</v>

2772
02:06:28.870 --> 02:06:33.460
<v Speaker 4>Also buying a hunting license goes to </v>
<v Speaker 4>create state fish and game agencies.</v>

2773
02:06:33.630 --> 02:06:35.560
<v Speaker 4>Many of these agencies are self </v>
<v Speaker 4>sustaining.</v>

2774
02:06:35.710 --> 02:06:40.710
<v Speaker 4>They don't get any tax payer funding.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Their funding comes through fees and </v>

2775
02:06:40.710 --> 02:06:43.711
<v Speaker 4>licenses and they do wildlife research.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pete is not funding wildlife research,</v>

2776
02:06:44.090 --> 02:06:47.080
<v Speaker 4>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's like they're just making noise,</v>

2777
02:06:47.200 --> 02:06:49.960
<v Speaker 4>but like the conversation so often comes</v>
<v Speaker 4>down to peter,</v>

2778
02:06:49.961 --> 02:06:52.840
<v Speaker 4>but peter has become a joke.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I mean when peta makes the news,</v>

2779
02:06:52.870 --> 02:06:56.320
<v Speaker 4>it's always like one of those guys up to</v>
<v Speaker 4>now is always the tone out.</v>

2780
02:06:56.321 --> 02:06:57.470
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that taken seriously.</v>

2781
02:06:59.790 --> 02:07:04.790
<v Speaker 4>I don't think the animal right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't think that people who self </v>

2782
02:07:04.790 --> 02:07:08.911
<v Speaker 4>identify as animal rights advocates are </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually dangerous.</v>

2783
02:07:09.700 --> 02:07:10.990
<v Speaker 4>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not significant.</v>

2784
02:07:10.991 --> 02:07:15.991
<v Speaker 4>I want to disagree with you.</v>
<v Speaker 4>If we can snuggle and share a </v>

2785
02:07:15.991 --> 02:07:15.991
<v Speaker 4>microphone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There we go</v>

2786
02:07:15.991 --> 02:07:18.560
<v Speaker 7>because I think that peta is the clown </v>
<v Speaker 7>shoes of the animal rights movement,</v>

2787
02:07:18.590 --> 02:07:23.590
<v Speaker 7>but they're there in a way to be a </v>
<v Speaker 7>distraction for like the hsus is of the </v>

2788
02:07:24.021 --> 02:07:29.021
<v Speaker 7>world he made.</v>
<v Speaker 7>He made to the United States and </v>

2789
02:07:29.021 --> 02:07:32.300
<v Speaker 7>everyone thinks that the humane society </v>
<v Speaker 7>is your local dog and cat shelter.</v>

2790
02:07:32.301 --> 02:07:33.950
<v Speaker 7>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But nationally,</v>

2791
02:07:33.951 --> 02:07:37.150
<v Speaker 7>hsus,</v>
<v Speaker 7>the society of the United States doesn't</v>

2792
02:07:37.151 --> 02:07:42.151
<v Speaker 7>really fund your local animal shelter.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They try to raise money off of you </v>

2793
02:07:42.151 --> 02:07:43.780
<v Speaker 7>thinking that they fund your local </v>
<v Speaker 7>animal shelter,</v>

2794
02:07:43.781 --> 02:07:47.590
<v Speaker 7>but instead they're the.</v>
<v Speaker 7>They're the non clown shoes.</v>

2795
02:07:47.591 --> 02:07:50.500
<v Speaker 7>Animal rights group,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they're the suit and tie in lobbying.</v>

2796
02:07:50.890 --> 02:07:53.320
<v Speaker 7>Go to politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 7>they know how to raise money,</v>

2797
02:07:53.321 --> 02:07:58.321
<v Speaker 7>they know how to be effective.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Talking to politicians in banning </v>

2798
02:07:58.321 --> 02:07:58.780
<v Speaker 7>certain types of hunting.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And pete is there.</v>

2799
02:07:58.781 --> 02:08:00.670
<v Speaker 7>I think really just be that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 7>distraction,</v>

2800
02:08:00.970 --> 02:08:01.630
<v Speaker 7>you know?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Oh look,</v>

2801
02:08:01.631 --> 02:08:04.280
<v Speaker 7>it's the chicks who were getting taken </v>
<v Speaker 7>and tigers.</v>

2802
02:08:04.550 --> 02:08:06.820
<v Speaker 7>It's the people who are wearing like the</v>
<v Speaker 7>little lettuce bikinis,</v>

2803
02:08:07.060 --> 02:08:07.700
<v Speaker 7>but michael,</v>
<v Speaker 7>mark,</v>

2804
02:08:07.701 --> 02:08:09.250
<v Speaker 7>harry and,</v>
<v Speaker 7>or wayne pacelli at,</v>

2805
02:08:09.251 --> 02:08:10.760
<v Speaker 7>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 7>at hsus.</v>

2806
02:08:11.080 --> 02:08:12.520
<v Speaker 7>Their goals the same.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I mean,</v>

2807
02:08:12.521 --> 02:08:14.680
<v Speaker 7>wayne pacelle,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you said we want to see a day when there</v>

2808
02:08:14.681 --> 02:08:18.340
<v Speaker 7>is no hunting in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Why do you need to hunt anymore?</v>

2809
02:08:18.341 --> 02:08:21.590
<v Speaker 7>You can go to the grocery store and you </v>
<v Speaker 7>can get your corn fed.</v>

2810
02:08:21.840 --> 02:08:26.840
<v Speaker 5>That's what's really insane is that </v>
<v Speaker 5>someone would want to take away your </v>

2811
02:08:26.840 --> 02:08:28.230
<v Speaker 5>ability to acquire,</v>
<v Speaker 5>meet your way.</v>

2812
02:08:28.410 --> 02:08:33.410
<v Speaker 5>That somehow or another it would be good</v>
<v Speaker 5>to only be able to get your meat from </v>

2813
02:08:33.410 --> 02:08:33.420
<v Speaker 5>farmer.</v>

2814
02:08:33.610 --> 02:08:36.550
<v Speaker 3>I think they want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't even think that I want to get to</v>

2815
02:08:36.551 --> 02:08:39.120
<v Speaker 3>a day where we're growing meat and </v>
<v Speaker 3>laboratories and we've got,</v>

2816
02:08:39.370 --> 02:08:41.800
<v Speaker 3>we've got our test tube van.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think you're right,</v>

2817
02:08:41.920 --> 02:08:43.510
<v Speaker 3>but I think they don't understand that</v>

2818
02:08:43.730 --> 02:08:48.730
<v Speaker 5>be this insane imbalance in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>ecosystem that would probably lead to </v>

2819
02:08:49.670 --> 02:08:49.730
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2820
02:08:49.820 --> 02:08:53.150
<v Speaker 3>the rise of predators and not to mention</v>
<v Speaker 3>the loss of humanity.</v>

2821
02:08:53.151 --> 02:08:53.750
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

2822
02:08:53.751 --> 02:08:58.220
<v Speaker 3>there is something innately human about </v>
<v Speaker 3>taking your food.</v>

2823
02:08:58.940 --> 02:09:02.960
<v Speaker 3>Then I think we would lose if we grew </v>
<v Speaker 3>our food and in the laboratory.</v>

2824
02:09:02.990 --> 02:09:05.720
<v Speaker 3>Your definition of human is what they </v>
<v Speaker 3>want to change.</v>

2825
02:09:05.721 --> 02:09:09.230
<v Speaker 3>I think what they want to change is they</v>
<v Speaker 3>want us to evolve.</v>

2826
02:09:09.500 --> 02:09:13.850
<v Speaker 5>It's this need to be reliant upon our </v>
<v Speaker 5>primal instincts and my,</v>

2827
02:09:13.880 --> 02:09:16.430
<v Speaker 5>my thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>my thinking on that as always,</v>

2828
02:09:16.431 --> 02:09:21.230
<v Speaker 5>I understand the idealistic or utopian </v>
<v Speaker 5>sort of pull in that direction,</v>

2829
02:09:21.470 --> 02:09:23.810
<v Speaker 5>but there's also a reality about the </v>
<v Speaker 5>time that we live in.</v>

2830
02:09:23.870 --> 02:09:28.870
<v Speaker 5>Although we can see like a bright future</v>
<v Speaker 5>where we become beings of light who can </v>

2831
02:09:28.870 --> 02:09:31.640
<v Speaker 5>read each other's minds and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the internet is used to travel on,</v>

2832
02:09:31.850 --> 02:09:33.290
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>maybe that's the future.</v>

2833
02:09:33.291 --> 02:09:35.180
<v Speaker 5>Maybe that's a million years from now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever the fuck it is.</v>

2834
02:09:35.181 --> 02:09:40.181
<v Speaker 5>But reality is right now.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Animals don't live forever and they're </v>

2835
02:09:40.181 --> 02:09:43.241
<v Speaker 5>delicious.</v>
<v Speaker 5>When you eat them and you guys are </v>

2836
02:09:43.241 --> 02:09:43.241
<v Speaker 5>getting crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>okay,</v>

2837
02:09:43.241 --> 02:09:44.690
<v Speaker 5>you're not going to live forever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Neither that deer,</v>

2838
02:09:44.840 --> 02:09:48.680
<v Speaker 5>neither is that cow like this is nuts.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Like the idea that you shouldn't torture</v>

2839
02:09:48.681 --> 02:09:50.060
<v Speaker 5>them a 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm with you.</v>

2840
02:09:50.180 --> 02:09:55.180
<v Speaker 5>The the idea that you shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>psychologically damaged them by leaving </v>

2841
02:09:55.180 --> 02:09:55.370
<v Speaker 5>them in cages their whole life.</v>

2842
02:09:55.390 --> 02:09:57.650
<v Speaker 5>Then finally shooting them and eating </v>
<v Speaker 5>them and yeah,</v>

2843
02:09:57.651 --> 02:09:59.600
<v Speaker 5>there's a lot of bad karma that </v>
<v Speaker 5>wouldn't.</v>

2844
02:09:59.780 --> 02:10:04.780
<v Speaker 5>That would make me think that the people</v>
<v Speaker 5>that would be the real animal activists </v>

2845
02:10:04.780 --> 02:10:06.130
<v Speaker 5>would be the ones that want to encourage</v>
<v Speaker 5>the,</v>

2846
02:10:06.160 --> 02:10:11.160
<v Speaker 5>the natural food chain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like you're not going to stop people </v>

2847
02:10:11.160 --> 02:10:11.160
<v Speaker 5>from eating meat.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're just not.</v>

2848
02:10:11.160 --> 02:10:12.080
<v Speaker 5>It's too.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We like it too much.</v>

2849
02:10:12.290 --> 02:10:17.290
<v Speaker 5>There's too much scientific evidence </v>
<v Speaker 5>that there's benefits through </v>

2850
02:10:17.290 --> 02:10:21.311
<v Speaker 5>cholesterol is for brain function,</v>
<v Speaker 5>inflammation and there's a lot of </v>

2851
02:10:21.311 --> 02:10:25.091
<v Speaker 5>benefits of eating meat and vegans don't</v>
<v Speaker 5>want to believe that because a lot of </v>

2852
02:10:25.091 --> 02:10:28.160
<v Speaker 5>vegans what their.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What their thing is is that they used to</v>

2853
02:10:28.161 --> 02:10:33.161
<v Speaker 5>have an unbelievably shitty diet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They used to eat fucking bullshit and </v>

2854
02:10:33.161 --> 02:10:34.790
<v Speaker 5>cheeseburgers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>shitty food and blah blah,</v>

2855
02:10:34.791 --> 02:10:35.060
<v Speaker 5>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>blah,</v>

2856
02:10:35.061 --> 02:10:36.740
<v Speaker 5>blah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but now that they're eating vegan,</v>

2857
02:10:36.741 --> 02:10:38.610
<v Speaker 5>they feel so much better.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Oh my god,</v>

2858
02:10:38.611 --> 02:10:43.611
<v Speaker 5>and now they're like these proselytizing</v>
<v Speaker 5>for the vegan religion and they're going</v>

2859
02:10:43.671 --> 02:10:45.800
<v Speaker 5>around telling everybody how amazing it </v>
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

2860
02:10:45.801 --> 02:10:48.080
<v Speaker 5>how amazing they feel to be vegan,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but I'm like,</v>

2861
02:10:48.140 --> 02:10:53.140
<v Speaker 5>I understand you're right.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of great nutrients in </v>

2862
02:10:53.140 --> 02:10:53.990
<v Speaker 5>vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but end meet.</v>

2863
02:10:56.340 --> 02:11:01.340
<v Speaker 5>There's a lot of good in that too,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I'm a person who never did like eat </v>

2864
02:11:01.340 --> 02:11:02.960
<v Speaker 5>their body away.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I never did eat shit food all the time.</v>

2865
02:11:03.140 --> 02:11:08.060
<v Speaker 5>I understand that the direct correlation</v>
<v Speaker 5>between nutritional supplementation,</v>

2866
02:11:08.090 --> 02:11:10.460
<v Speaker 5>eating healthy vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 5>eating good,</v>

2867
02:11:10.461 --> 02:11:13.880
<v Speaker 5>lean meat and feeling better and your </v>
<v Speaker 5>body actually performing,</v>

2868
02:11:14.090 --> 02:11:16.550
<v Speaker 5>especially in something like really </v>
<v Speaker 5>intense when you.</v>

2869
02:11:16.551 --> 02:11:18.860
<v Speaker 5>When you get into like jujitsu,</v>
<v Speaker 5>any kind of martial art,</v>

2870
02:11:19.250 --> 02:11:23.210
<v Speaker 5>the stakes of you being good or bad or </v>
<v Speaker 5>you getting your ass kicked and that's a</v>

2871
02:11:23.211 --> 02:11:28.211
<v Speaker 5>terrible feeling that every man wants to</v>
<v Speaker 5>avoid and you understand what's working,</v>

2872
02:11:28.431 --> 02:11:33.431
<v Speaker 5>what's not working.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Pragmatism comes into play when you're </v>

2873
02:11:33.431 --> 02:11:34.010
<v Speaker 5>involved in anything,</v>
<v Speaker 5>any competitive athletic,</v>

2874
02:11:34.011 --> 02:11:38.180
<v Speaker 5>especially combat sports like you better</v>
<v Speaker 5>eat the right shit,</v>

2875
02:11:38.510 --> 02:11:40.760
<v Speaker 5>you better take your fucking vital </v>
<v Speaker 5>because if you don't,</v>

2876
02:11:40.880 --> 02:11:45.880
<v Speaker 5>it's a difference between you just </v>
<v Speaker 5>barely getting out of a submission and </v>

2877
02:11:45.880 --> 02:11:47.570
<v Speaker 5>getting to a dominant position and </v>
<v Speaker 5>winning or you tap again.</v>

2878
02:11:47.740 --> 02:11:48.710
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I mean it literally.</v>

2879
02:11:48.711 --> 02:11:51.410
<v Speaker 5>Sometimes it's that close.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a Few beats of a heart.</v>

2880
02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:56.480
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's whether or not you have just that </v>

2881
02:11:56.480 --> 02:11:56.480
<v Speaker 5>extra push of oxygen in your,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in your body.</v>

2882
02:11:56.480 --> 02:11:58.520
<v Speaker 5>People that do that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they like me.</v>

2883
02:11:59.270 --> 02:12:00.210
<v Speaker 5>Most of them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

2884
02:12:00.290 --> 02:12:00.960
<v Speaker 5>they,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know.</v>

2885
02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:02.330
<v Speaker 5>Not only that but it's life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

2886
02:12:02.331 --> 02:12:07.331
<v Speaker 5>if you look at nature,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's such a classic and stark example </v>

2887
02:12:07.331 --> 02:12:11.171
<v Speaker 5>of how life eats life.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That's always been life eats life by the</v>

2888
02:12:11.211 --> 02:12:13.070
<v Speaker 5>way,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether or not you're eating animals,</v>

2889
02:12:13.160 --> 02:12:15.020
<v Speaker 5>you're still kivit telling,</v>
<v Speaker 5>living thing.</v>

2890
02:12:15.050 --> 02:12:15.310
<v Speaker 5>This is the</v>

2891
02:12:15.310 --> 02:12:20.310
<v Speaker 4>thing I've always wondered about and </v>
<v Speaker 4>actually maybe like I'm relying on the </v>

2892
02:12:20.310 --> 02:12:21.960
<v Speaker 4>expertise of your viewers and this isn't</v>
<v Speaker 4>something that.</v>

2893
02:12:22.180 --> 02:12:25.550
<v Speaker 4>This isn't a question that they'd be </v>
<v Speaker 4>able to answer through a format.</v>

2894
02:12:25.551 --> 02:12:27.380
<v Speaker 4>Like twitter will take like a lengthy </v>
<v Speaker 4>email.</v>

2895
02:12:27.381 --> 02:12:29.740
<v Speaker 4>if someone knows and whenever I have you</v>
<v Speaker 4>do,</v>

2896
02:12:29.810 --> 02:12:31.690
<v Speaker 4>don't give out your email right now,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they're,</v>

2897
02:12:32.330 --> 02:12:34.850
<v Speaker 4>it's going to go to you and then you're </v>
<v Speaker 4>going to send it to me if it's good,</v>

2898
02:12:35.070 --> 02:12:37.970
<v Speaker 4>but whenever I ask this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people think I'm being like that.</v>

2899
02:12:37.971 --> 02:12:40.280
<v Speaker 4>I'm trying to demonstrate absurdity by </v>
<v Speaker 4>being absurd,</v>

2900
02:12:40.310 --> 02:12:45.310
<v Speaker 4>but it really is something I wonder </v>
<v Speaker 4>about and I'm sure there's a great </v>

2901
02:12:45.310 --> 02:12:45.310
<v Speaker 4>answer for it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In the,</v>

2902
02:12:45.310 --> 02:12:49.960
<v Speaker 4>in the mindset of a of a,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of a diehard animal rights person who </v>

2903
02:12:49.960 --> 02:12:52.880
<v Speaker 4>feels that human life is equal to animal</v>
<v Speaker 4>life.</v>

2904
02:12:53.270 --> 02:12:58.270
<v Speaker 4>What do they propose we should do?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like once we conquer the problem of </v>

2905
02:12:58.641 --> 02:13:02.000
<v Speaker 4>humans consuming animals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>human induced animal suffering,</v>

2906
02:13:02.420 --> 02:13:05.410
<v Speaker 4>what do they propose is gonna look like?</v>
<v Speaker 4>What will it do with control?</v>

2907
02:13:05.420 --> 02:13:06.680
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What will they do with the bottle?</v>

2908
02:13:06.681 --> 02:13:07.460
<v Speaker 4>Nose.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Dolphin.</v>

2909
02:13:07.820 --> 02:13:12.820
<v Speaker 4>Like how will it be that he is forced to</v>
<v Speaker 4>stop consuming fish and I'm not trying </v>

2910
02:13:13.881 --> 02:13:16.730
<v Speaker 4>to be like a smart ass.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Like what will,</v>

2911
02:13:17.030 --> 02:13:22.030
<v Speaker 4>what will you do to get coyotes?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If life is life is life okay?</v>

2912
02:13:23.620 --> 02:13:27.830
<v Speaker 4>When will they be offended by the </v>
<v Speaker 4>actions of a coyote who's killing things</v>

2913
02:13:27.831 --> 02:13:29.540
<v Speaker 4>to survive?</v>
<v Speaker 4>I know it's like he has to,</v>

2914
02:13:29.660 --> 02:13:31.980
<v Speaker 4>but really if you caught them all in </v>
<v Speaker 4>separate and you'd be</v>

2915
02:13:31.980 --> 02:13:36.980
<v Speaker 1>able to feed them a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not trying to be as smart as like </v>

2916
02:13:36.980 --> 02:13:41.060
<v Speaker 1>what is the answer?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think they make a very distinct </v>

2917
02:13:41.060 --> 02:13:44.090
<v Speaker 1>difference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big difference between humans and </v>

2918
02:13:44.090 --> 02:13:44.090
<v Speaker 1>animals right now as far as they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned,</v>

2919
02:13:44.090 --> 02:13:46.200
<v Speaker 1>there is a big difference because human </v>
<v Speaker 1>beings have a choice.</v>

2920
02:13:46.410 --> 02:13:51.410
<v Speaker 1>Our choice could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could be herbivores and exclusivelY </v>

2921
02:13:51.410 --> 02:13:53.070
<v Speaker 1>herbivores and according to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even healthier than meat eaters,</v>

2922
02:13:53.071 --> 02:13:58.071
<v Speaker 1>which I disagree with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think everybody and I read the China </v>

2923
02:13:58.071 --> 02:13:58.071
<v Speaker 1>study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody you know,</v>

2924
02:13:58.560 --> 02:14:03.560
<v Speaker 1>but it's like I'm a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't read the whole thing by the </v>

2925
02:14:03.560 --> 02:14:03.560
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I sure did.</v>

2926
02:14:03.560 --> 02:14:04.500
<v Speaker 1>I sure did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2927
02:14:04.540 --> 02:14:09.030
<v Speaker 1>you didn't read that whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Faculty chapter eight is the best part.</v>

2928
02:14:09.090 --> 02:14:14.090
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that where pinocchio gets us out of </v>

2929
02:14:14.221 --> 02:14:19.221
<v Speaker 1>the whales?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All you have to do is read the end </v>

2930
02:14:19.221 --> 02:14:19.221
<v Speaker 1>actually because he talks about how how </v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

2931
02:14:19.221 --> 02:14:23.150
<v Speaker 1>how industry hijacks the sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>high jacks,</v>

2932
02:14:23.670 --> 02:14:28.670
<v Speaker 1>government agencies like the school </v>
<v Speaker 1>lunch program and what the military </v>

2933
02:14:28.670 --> 02:14:31.740
<v Speaker 1>feeds his soldiers into buying their </v>
<v Speaker 1>food scientists.</v>

2934
02:14:31.740 --> 02:14:36.740
<v Speaker 1>TheY stacked the deck and get scientists</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say that 25 percent of your fucking </v>

2935
02:14:36.740 --> 02:14:39.810
<v Speaker 1>diet can be simple sugars because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a lot of money and high fructose</v>

2936
02:14:39.811 --> 02:14:42.300
<v Speaker 1>corn syrup and for the corn refiners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

2937
02:14:42.510 --> 02:14:47.510
<v Speaker 1>It's a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very amazing though people don't </v>

2938
02:14:47.510 --> 02:14:49.140
<v Speaker 1>understand like how that happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how all the sudden like the government,</v>

2939
02:14:49.200 --> 02:14:54.200
<v Speaker 1>it gives farmers money to subsidies on </v>
<v Speaker 1>corn,</v>

2940
02:14:54.241 --> 02:14:56.600
<v Speaker 1>like to encourage the growth of corn and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just.</v>

2941
02:14:56.610 --> 02:14:58.350
<v Speaker 1>It's not family farms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember everybody,</v>

2942
02:14:58.351 --> 02:15:01.960
<v Speaker 1>it's huge industrial farms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They get the bulk of the balkans somehow</v>

2943
02:15:01.961 --> 02:15:06.961
<v Speaker 1>know that they watched each other's </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands and figure out how to slap each </v>

2944
02:15:06.961 --> 02:15:09.100
<v Speaker 1>other in the back and stack the deck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the t dot collin campbell does a.</v>

2945
02:15:09.150 --> 02:15:10.710
<v Speaker 1>He was a scientist on one of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>boards.</v>

2946
02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:15.960
<v Speaker 1>They do a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He does a very good job as a scientist </v>

2947
02:15:15.960 --> 02:15:19.311
<v Speaker 1>who is involved in the stuff and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>names names because he's friends with </v>

2957
02:15:40.890 --> 02:15:45.890
<v Speaker 1>Listen to what monsanto was done at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Monsanto has bought up a company that </v>

2958
02:15:45.991 --> 02:15:50.991
<v Speaker 1>was the leading company on be research </v>
<v Speaker 1>because those are the people that said </v>

2959
02:15:50.991 --> 02:15:54.420
<v Speaker 1>that monsanto's pesticides and all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shit that's in their food is a causing b</v>

2960
02:15:54.841 --> 02:15:57.840
<v Speaker 1>populations to decline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so monsanto buys them.</v>

2961
02:15:57.990 --> 02:16:02.990
<v Speaker 1>Then monsanto develops a fucking robot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Be okay.</v>

2962
02:16:04.741 --> 02:16:07.670
<v Speaker 1>I thought I joked around about it in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>act.</v>

2963
02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:12.680
<v Speaker 1>I said that bs as such country animals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope that we make solar powered robot </v>

2964
02:16:12.680 --> 02:16:14.670
<v Speaker 1>bees that fueled themselves by.</v>

2965
02:16:14.820 --> 02:16:19.820
<v Speaker 1>They have dicks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're actually vacuum cleaners and </v>

2966
02:16:19.820 --> 02:16:22.431
<v Speaker 1>they just fuck real beat to death and </v>
<v Speaker 1>suck the life out and burn inside the </v>

2967
02:16:22.431 --> 02:16:24.390
<v Speaker 1>combustion engine and I was just joking </v>
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>

2968
02:16:24.690 --> 02:16:26.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean anything anybody would actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>make a robot be.</v>

2969
02:16:26.751 --> 02:16:31.751
<v Speaker 1>But I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how tough is it to pollinate a fucking </v>

2970
02:16:31.751 --> 02:16:31.751
<v Speaker 1>plant?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even know they're doing it.</v>

2971
02:16:31.751 --> 02:16:34.260
<v Speaker 1>They're doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean santa stealing your material this</v>

2972
02:16:34.260 --> 02:16:34.600
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

2973
02:16:34.601 --> 02:16:39.601
<v Speaker 1>they thought about it like.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bet they thought about it before me </v>

2974
02:16:39.601 --> 02:16:42.580
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it takes a long time to develop a </v>

2975
02:16:42.580 --> 02:16:44.731
<v Speaker 1>fucking drove.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But they have a robot be monsanto has </v>

2976
02:16:44.731 --> 02:16:44.731
<v Speaker 1>fucking robot beat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2977
02:16:44.731 --> 02:16:45.230
<v Speaker 1>they're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're the.</v>

2978
02:16:45.560 --> 02:16:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Pulled up a picture of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pull up a picture with someone.</v>

2979
02:16:48.470 --> 02:16:50.900
<v Speaker 1>Monsanto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>robot b is in the news today.</v>

2980
02:16:51.380 --> 02:16:53.510
<v Speaker 1>Along with that fucking explosion in </v>
<v Speaker 1>boston.</v>

2981
02:16:54.380 --> 02:16:57.020
<v Speaker 1>Is there any new evidence on that or </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on?</v>

2982
02:16:57.080 --> 02:16:58.070
<v Speaker 1>We should probably know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

2983
02:16:58.130 --> 02:17:00.310
<v Speaker 1>Let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kid guide.</v>

2984
02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:02.080
<v Speaker 1>A eight year old kid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

2985
02:17:02.950 --> 02:17:06.850
<v Speaker 1>Do they know it was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Was it like a sophisticated form?</v>

2986
02:17:06.880 --> 02:17:08.300
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's a,</v>

2987
02:17:08.380 --> 02:17:11.590
<v Speaker 1>it looks like it's a fire and it looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>like there was ball bearings in it,</v>

2988
02:17:11.591 --> 02:17:15.610
<v Speaker 1>so it looks like it's probably just one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of those ones you can find out online,</v>

2989
02:17:16.180 --> 02:17:19.840
<v Speaker 1>like a doMestic produced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unbelievably horrific.</v>

2990
02:17:19.900 --> 02:17:23.770
<v Speaker 1>This is 741.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People have been injured a 144.</v>

2991
02:17:23.771 --> 02:17:27.580
<v Speaker 1>At least 37 of orally 17 rather are a </v>
<v Speaker 1>critical injuries.</v>

2992
02:17:27.670 --> 02:17:30.250
<v Speaker 1>Dr sara pulling ball bearings out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

2993
02:17:31.180 --> 02:17:32.230
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh my god.</v>

2994
02:17:32.560 --> 02:17:34.150
<v Speaker 1>Now monsanto,</v>
<v Speaker 1>monsanto,</v>

2995
02:17:34.151 --> 02:17:36.920
<v Speaker 1>robot be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

2996
02:17:37.130 --> 02:17:39.250
<v Speaker 1>that scares me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to come up with wasps that</v>

2997
02:17:39.650 --> 02:17:43.540
<v Speaker 1>can distinguish that thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the one with the quarter.</v>

2998
02:17:43.630 --> 02:17:45.070
<v Speaker 1>The one right next to it with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>quarter.</v>

2999
02:17:45.100 --> 02:17:49.270
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the one up in The upper right.</v>

3000
02:17:49.271 --> 02:17:50.410
<v Speaker 1>That one right there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that.</v>

3001
02:17:50.710 --> 02:17:55.710
<v Speaker 1>Look at that fucking thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is monsanto's robot b and that </v>

3002
02:17:55.710 --> 02:17:59.230
<v Speaker 1>thing is going to have the same function</v>
<v Speaker 1>that had actual ob does like there'll be</v>

3003
02:17:59.231 --> 02:18:03.130
<v Speaker 1>able to get them to fly back and forth </v>
<v Speaker 1>and pollinate plants.</v>

3004
02:18:06.080 --> 02:18:07.340
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we killed off the bees.</v>

3005
02:18:07.341 --> 02:18:09.920
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We got terminator bees tHat we developed</v>

3006
02:18:09.921 --> 02:18:10.820
<v Speaker 1>specifically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>

3007
02:18:10.840 --> 02:18:11.600
<v Speaker 1>don't sweat it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dude,</v>

3008
02:18:12.160 --> 02:18:13.610
<v Speaker 1>in my,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the way Montana will probably,</v>

3009
02:18:13.940 --> 02:18:18.940
<v Speaker 1>monsanto rather owns the copyright on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the east and nobody else can make their </v>

3010
02:18:18.940 --> 02:18:22.961
<v Speaker 1>own robot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bees are going to have to buy robot </v>

3011
02:18:22.961 --> 02:18:22.961
<v Speaker 1>beach,</v>
<v Speaker 1>monsanto and like a real baby.</v>

3012
02:18:22.961 --> 02:18:23.000
<v Speaker 1>They only last like a week.</v>

3013
02:18:23.290 --> 02:18:24.110
<v Speaker 8>There was a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

3014
02:18:25.980 --> 02:18:28.120
<v Speaker 8>in the 18 hundreds there was this,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

3015
02:18:28.121 --> 02:18:31.270
<v Speaker 8>there was uh,</v>
<v Speaker 8>uh,</v>

3016
02:18:31.470 --> 02:18:35.140
<v Speaker 8>my mind is escaping was the guy who </v>
<v Speaker 8>started the one who studies plants,</v>

3017
02:18:35.380 --> 02:18:40.380
<v Speaker 8>herb there,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's a botanist who was her </v>

3018
02:18:40.380 --> 02:18:42.970
<v Speaker 8>biologist.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Botanist was making.</v>

3019
02:18:42.971 --> 02:18:47.971
<v Speaker 8>I was making like an exploration of the </v>
<v Speaker 8>american west and he was talking about </v>

3020
02:18:48.130 --> 02:18:50.230
<v Speaker 8>and he wrote for awhile about the </v>
<v Speaker 8>advance of,</v>

3021
02:18:50.310 --> 02:18:52.150
<v Speaker 8>of the honeybee.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Know the honeybee is not a native,</v>

3022
02:18:52.330 --> 02:18:54.010
<v Speaker 8>not native to this continent.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Really?</v>

3023
02:18:54.100 --> 02:18:59.100
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He's talking about the advance of the </v>

3024
02:18:59.100 --> 02:18:59.100
<v Speaker 8>advance of honeybees across the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>across the continent.</v>

3025
02:18:59.100 --> 02:18:59.980
<v Speaker 8>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 8>chips.</v>

3026
02:19:00.840 --> 02:19:02.980
<v Speaker 8>People brought it up.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They brought it on purpose.</v>

3027
02:19:02.981 --> 02:19:03.760
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like I'm,</v>

3028
02:19:03.850 --> 02:19:04.810
<v Speaker 8>again,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I'm escaping like,</v>

3029
02:19:04.870 --> 02:19:09.870
<v Speaker 8>not an aviary but a ap or people brought</v>
<v Speaker 8>them for honey production and they went </v>

3030
02:19:13.571 --> 02:19:18.571
<v Speaker 8>feral very successfully and he was in,</v>
<v Speaker 8>in this bondness describes and he made </v>

3031
02:19:18.761 --> 02:19:19.720
<v Speaker 8>his trip,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like if some,</v>

3032
02:19:19.780 --> 02:19:24.780
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I remember he made his trip and 1811 </v>

3033
02:19:24.780 --> 02:19:26.230
<v Speaker 8>because his getting home was interrupted</v>
<v Speaker 8>by the war of 18,</v>

3034
02:19:26.231 --> 02:19:30.240
<v Speaker 8>12 and he was on the Missouri when the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>um,</v>

3035
02:19:30.241 --> 02:19:35.100
<v Speaker 8>when that great earthquake,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the earthquake struck,</v>

3036
02:19:35.101 --> 02:19:37.740
<v Speaker 8>that actually switched the direction of </v>
<v Speaker 8>the mississippi's flow.</v>

3037
02:19:37.800 --> 02:19:38.640
<v Speaker 8>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Uh,</v>

3038
02:19:38.670 --> 02:19:40.200
<v Speaker 8>he was there and then it got delayed by </v>
<v Speaker 8>the war.</v>

3039
02:19:40.201 --> 02:19:40.710
<v Speaker 8>18,</v>
<v Speaker 8>12.</v>

3040
02:19:40.890 --> 02:19:42.300
<v Speaker 8>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 8>shit luck,</v>

3041
02:19:42.360 --> 02:19:43.830
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he had this guy,</v>

3042
02:19:44.040 --> 02:19:46.080
<v Speaker 8>this guy had bradbury.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Bradbury was his name,</v>

3043
02:19:46.081 --> 02:19:47.840
<v Speaker 8>like the novelist,</v>
<v Speaker 8>his name is brad bird.</v>

3044
02:19:48.060 --> 02:19:53.060
<v Speaker 8>He had amazingly bad luck.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He thought he's Just going on a little </v>

3045
02:19:53.060 --> 02:19:54.180
<v Speaker 8>trip and it took them seven years to get</v>
<v Speaker 8>home and all the material,</v>

3046
02:19:54.240 --> 02:19:55.530
<v Speaker 8>all the material,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the bradbury,</v>

3047
02:19:55.610 --> 02:20:00.610
<v Speaker 8>all the material.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He gathered all the plant specImens he </v>

3048
02:20:00.610 --> 02:20:03.411
<v Speaker 8>took,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he got done and he wanted to take a </v>

3049
02:20:03.411 --> 02:20:03.411
<v Speaker 8>different route home.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So he sent his assistant.</v>

3050
02:20:03.990 --> 02:20:05.300
<v Speaker 8>Homewood is stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

3051
02:20:05.640 --> 02:20:10.640
<v Speaker 8>But it's assistant gets home years </v>
<v Speaker 8>earlier and by the time this dude makes </v>

3052
02:20:10.640 --> 02:20:11.700
<v Speaker 8>it back home,</v>
<v Speaker 8>assistant has published all the material</v>

3053
02:20:11.701 --> 02:20:12.390
<v Speaker 8>under his own name.</v>

3054
02:20:14.610 --> 02:20:19.610
<v Speaker 8>But anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 8>in this book he has this really </v>

3055
02:20:19.610 --> 02:20:21.981
<v Speaker 8>interesting,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that's really interesting passage about </v>

3056
02:20:21.981 --> 02:20:24.570
<v Speaker 8>how fast bees are advancing and how they</v>
<v Speaker 8>always keep pace.</v>

3057
02:20:24.890 --> 02:20:26.670
<v Speaker 8>They're always out ahead of the </v>
<v Speaker 8>frontier.</v>

3058
02:20:27.090 --> 02:20:32.090
<v Speaker 8>So at the time when he was writing,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he was talking about like the be </v>

3059
02:20:32.090 --> 02:20:33.270
<v Speaker 8>somewhere in North Dakota or whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 8>be saying like reliably,</v>

3060
02:20:33.271 --> 02:20:35.690
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>we were in st louis in a,</v>

3061
02:20:35.770 --> 02:20:40.770
<v Speaker 8>in a strong way and bs or 40 miles out </v>
<v Speaker 8>and they'll bs will continue to march </v>

3062
02:20:40.770 --> 02:20:41.550
<v Speaker 8>across.</v>
<v Speaker 8>That's what I like.</v>

3063
02:20:41.580 --> 02:20:45.870
<v Speaker 8>Colony collapse disorder is interesting </v>
<v Speaker 8>is it is.</v>

3064
02:20:46.200 --> 02:20:51.200
<v Speaker 8>I don't think of it as a wildlife issue.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I think of it as an agricultural issue,</v>

3065
02:20:52.200 --> 02:20:57.200
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Because I'm not naturally as a non </v>

3066
02:20:57.200 --> 02:20:57.200
<v Speaker 8>native species,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's a,</v>

3067
02:20:57.200 --> 02:20:59.340
<v Speaker 8>it's an agricultural problem and it's a </v>
<v Speaker 8>saturday or cultural problem.</v>

3068
02:20:59.341 --> 02:21:04.341
<v Speaker 8>But I don't.</v>
<v Speaker 8>when I think of like wildlife politics </v>

3069
02:21:04.341 --> 02:21:05.070
<v Speaker 8>and the wellbeing of american wildlife,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which I have a vested interest in,</v>

3070
02:21:05.380 --> 02:21:10.380
<v Speaker 8>like I don't look at colony collapse </v>
<v Speaker 8>disorder as it's a serious economic </v>

3071
02:21:10.380 --> 02:21:10.380
<v Speaker 8>problem.</v>

3072
02:21:10.380 --> 02:21:15.030
<v Speaker 5>So there's that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These animals are these bees rather if </v>

3073
02:21:15.030 --> 02:21:15.160
<v Speaker 5>they didn't exist,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they hadn't been introduced here,</v>

3074
02:21:15.161 --> 02:21:16.990
<v Speaker 5>would agriculture be drastically </v>
<v Speaker 5>different?</v>

3075
02:21:18.300 --> 02:21:23.300
<v Speaker 8>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 8>I would say so because they're able to </v>

3076
02:21:23.300 --> 02:21:23.580
<v Speaker 8>use them in such a targeted like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3077
02:21:23.581 --> 02:21:26.190
<v Speaker 8>a guy that raises bees is doing two </v>
<v Speaker 8>things,</v>

3078
02:21:26.191 --> 02:21:29.520
<v Speaker 8>is producing honey and he's providing </v>
<v Speaker 8>pollination services.</v>

3079
02:21:29.910 --> 02:21:32.340
<v Speaker 8>So they do these things in tAndem.</v>
<v Speaker 8>You know,</v>

3080
02:21:32.670 --> 02:21:37.670
<v Speaker 8>when I was a,</v>
<v Speaker 8>when I was in college I worked for a </v>

3081
02:21:37.670 --> 02:21:38.040
<v Speaker 8>beekeeper and he would all the while </v>
<v Speaker 8>he's collecting honeycomb,</v>

3082
02:21:38.041 --> 02:21:39.450
<v Speaker 8>but at the same time he's moving stuff </v>
<v Speaker 8>around.</v>

3083
02:21:39.451 --> 02:21:40.890
<v Speaker 8>So at the beginning of the year he's </v>
<v Speaker 8>done.</v>

3084
02:21:40.900 --> 02:21:45.900
<v Speaker 8>He'd go down to Georgia,</v>
<v Speaker 8>he truck is bees down to george and he </v>

3085
02:21:45.900 --> 02:21:48.781
<v Speaker 8>do pollination services down there and I</v>
<v Speaker 8>think that it's just a way that you can </v>

3086
02:21:48.781 --> 02:21:52.521
<v Speaker 8>do like very targeted,</v>
<v Speaker 8>very fast synchronized pollination of </v>

3087
02:21:52.981 --> 02:21:57.981
<v Speaker 8>plant species that if you were relying </v>
<v Speaker 8>on native species of bees and moths and </v>

3088
02:22:00.181 --> 02:22:02.450
<v Speaker 8>butterflies that I gathered would take </v>
<v Speaker 8>much longer.</v>

3089
02:22:02.500 --> 02:22:04.090
<v Speaker 5>What are the native ones as opposed to </v>
<v Speaker 5>the.</v>

3090
02:22:04.270 --> 02:22:06.640
<v Speaker 5>The honeybees are not native.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Honeybees are not native.</v>

3091
02:22:06.641 --> 02:22:09.370
<v Speaker 5>So the north american indians,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they never got any honey.</v>

3092
02:22:09.371 --> 02:22:10.450
<v Speaker 5>But when we came along.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

3093
02:22:10.451 --> 02:22:10.530
<v Speaker 5>Psych.</v>

3094
02:22:10.590 --> 02:22:13.860
<v Speaker 8>I think that the honeybee produces like </v>
<v Speaker 8>a high,</v>

3095
02:22:14.710 --> 02:22:18.270
<v Speaker 8>like good quantities of a high quality </v>
<v Speaker 8>honey.</v>

3096
02:22:18.300 --> 02:22:23.300
<v Speaker 8>There are similar products produced,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there are similar things produced about </v>

3097
02:22:23.300 --> 02:22:26.500
<v Speaker 8>other things,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it's kind of like the reason that </v>

3098
02:22:26.500 --> 02:22:26.500
<v Speaker 8>goat's milk isn't really</v>

3099
02:22:26.500 --> 02:22:27.630
<v Speaker 3>a big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>strong product,</v>

3100
02:22:27.631 --> 02:22:29.410
<v Speaker 3>but cows can crank it out,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know?</v>

3101
02:22:29.620 --> 02:22:32.400
<v Speaker 3>And so in that way they were brought for</v>
<v Speaker 3>that purpose.</v>

3102
02:22:32.401 --> 02:22:35.790
<v Speaker 3>But there are many poLlinating insects </v>
<v Speaker 3>that were native to the us.</v>

3103
02:22:35.791 --> 02:22:38.910
<v Speaker 3>But like the specific honeybee is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we know it wAs introduced species.</v>

3104
02:22:39.570 --> 02:22:41.340
<v Speaker 3>Were they here?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

3105
02:22:41.341 --> 02:22:43.590
<v Speaker 3>but I would.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm sure they were.</v>

3106
02:22:44.160 --> 02:22:47.100
<v Speaker 3>I like to be the son of a bitch.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You introduce wasps to the United States</v>

3107
02:22:47.490 --> 02:22:48.750
<v Speaker 3>who brought,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who decided,</v>

3108
02:22:48.751 --> 02:22:50.640
<v Speaker 3>you know what bees they make honey,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think.</v>

3109
02:22:50.641 --> 02:22:52.770
<v Speaker 3>Let's see what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We bring wasps over here.</v>

3110
02:22:53.040 --> 02:22:55.960
<v Speaker 3>That guy from animal planet.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Screw that guy.</v>

3111
02:22:56.150 --> 02:22:58.570
<v Speaker 3>He had a short lived show on animal </v>
<v Speaker 3>planet and it was,</v>

3112
02:22:58.620 --> 02:23:01.170
<v Speaker 3>he was an entomologist and he was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>really weird dude.</v>

3113
02:23:01.470 --> 02:23:02.460
<v Speaker 3>And he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he goes,</v>

3114
02:23:02.461 --> 02:23:05.220
<v Speaker 3>look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he had this huge spider and he goes,</v>

3115
02:23:05.221 --> 02:23:07.620
<v Speaker 3>watch this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And he put it in his mouth and then they</v>

3116
02:23:07.630 --> 02:23:08.150
<v Speaker 3>pulled it out.</v>

3117
02:23:08.150 --> 02:23:09.540
<v Speaker 3>Was this huge transplant?</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

3118
02:23:09.690 --> 02:23:11.770
<v Speaker 3>now I won't bite me because I'm not a </v>
<v Speaker 3>moth.</v>

3119
02:23:11.820 --> 02:23:16.820
<v Speaker 3>If I was a moth that would bite me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but I'm a human so it doesn't know the </v>

3120
02:23:16.820 --> 02:23:16.820
<v Speaker 3>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm like,</v>

3121
02:23:16.820 --> 02:23:16.820
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if some filipino thing.</v>

3122
02:23:16.820 --> 02:23:17.850
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So I said,</v>

3123
02:23:17.851 --> 02:23:21.270
<v Speaker 3>I said that his claim to fame is he had </v>
<v Speaker 3>been stung by every,</v>

3124
02:23:21.660 --> 02:23:23.700
<v Speaker 3>every insect.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

3125
02:23:24.290 --> 02:23:25.400
<v Speaker 3>there is some,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

3126
02:23:25.800 --> 02:23:27.690
<v Speaker 3>there are some wasp out there that can </v>
<v Speaker 3>hurt you.</v>

3127
02:23:27.710 --> 02:23:29.340
<v Speaker 3>And he said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>oh yes.</v>

3128
02:23:29.400 --> 02:23:31.380
<v Speaker 3>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And I said,</v>

3129
02:23:31.381 --> 02:23:31.830
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

3130
02:23:31.831 --> 02:23:32.640
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3131
02:23:32.641 --> 02:23:37.110
<v Speaker 3>the tarantula hawk or the 24 hour and </v>
<v Speaker 3>that you find that Panama,</v>

3132
02:23:37.410 --> 02:23:40.350
<v Speaker 3>if they sting you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll fall to the ground and scream for</v>

3133
02:23:40.440 --> 02:23:42.600
<v Speaker 3>hours and hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He goes,</v>

3134
02:23:42.601 --> 02:23:45.180
<v Speaker 3>they call it the 24:00</v>
<v Speaker 3>AM because when you do get stung,</v>

3135
02:23:45.330 --> 02:23:47.160
<v Speaker 3>you can't sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't drink,</v>

3136
02:23:47.161 --> 02:23:50.190
<v Speaker 3>you can eat for 24 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The pain is so intense.</v>

3137
02:23:50.610 --> 02:23:51.720
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what was the pain like?</v>

3138
02:23:51.760 --> 02:23:56.760
<v Speaker 3>Is I liken it to getting your hand </v>
<v Speaker 3>slammed in a car door and being shot </v>

3139
02:23:56.760 --> 02:24:00.180
<v Speaker 3>with a 45 at the same tie.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He was this really weird guy.</v>

3140
02:24:00.540 --> 02:24:01.350
<v Speaker 3>I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

3141
02:24:01.670 --> 02:24:04.440
<v Speaker 3>I'll be staying away from the tarantula </v>
<v Speaker 3>hawk,</v>

3142
02:24:04.470 --> 02:24:07.620
<v Speaker 3>which is indigenous to this area in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Nevada.</v>

3143
02:24:08.790 --> 02:24:12.590
<v Speaker 1>Whenever you talk about any of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>really evil fucking bugs in the soil,</v>

3144
02:24:12.860 --> 02:24:17.860
<v Speaker 1>the shit out that's really.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That really drives me nuts about animal </v>

3145
02:24:17.860 --> 02:24:18.960
<v Speaker 1>rights activists because those are </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals too.</v>

3146
02:24:19.290 --> 02:24:24.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a whole broad ecosystem and a </v>

3147
02:24:24.290 --> 02:24:26.040
<v Speaker 1>lot of these things that are out there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't live with them.</v>

3148
02:24:26.280 --> 02:24:28.020
<v Speaker 1>If we live with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they kill us.</v>

3149
02:24:28.140 --> 02:24:33.140
<v Speaker 1>Like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you understand that there's ants in </v>

3150
02:24:33.140 --> 02:24:33.300
<v Speaker 1>africa that kill elephants?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They climb up in elephant's leg and they</v>

3151
02:24:33.301 --> 02:24:36.060
<v Speaker 1>go right through the fucking ear and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they start eating.</v>

3152
02:24:36.061 --> 02:24:38.040
<v Speaker 1>The elephant is actually your first </v>
<v Speaker 1>fuck.</v>

3153
02:24:38.041 --> 02:24:38.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's true.</v>

3154
02:24:38.700 --> 02:24:43.700
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of find them and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate with this with the other </v>

3155
02:24:43.700 --> 02:24:47.060
<v Speaker 1>aunts and they're evil colony and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>find this poor fucking outfit and they </v>

3156
02:24:47.060 --> 02:24:49.640
<v Speaker 1>climb up and they eat him ears first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you.</v>

3157
02:24:49.650 --> 02:24:54.650
<v Speaker 1>You must have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're competing because you know </v>

3158
02:24:54.650 --> 02:24:56.841
<v Speaker 1>this guy is my boys in san antonio who </v>
<v Speaker 1>made this big promotional video for me </v>

3159
02:24:56.850 --> 02:24:59.040
<v Speaker 1>that said no cons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coming to brian,</v>

3160
02:24:59.270 --> 02:25:01.650
<v Speaker 1>that squad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you kind of hit show no cons,</v>

3161
02:25:01.660 --> 02:25:03.300
<v Speaker 1>please.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that from you?</v>

3162
02:25:03.301 --> 02:25:05.250
<v Speaker 1>Is that you're a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3163
02:25:05.251 --> 02:25:08.520
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the number one problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>with human beings.</v>

3164
02:25:08.521 --> 02:25:12.120
<v Speaker 1>The number one problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we eliminated all kinds males,</v>

3165
02:25:12.540 --> 02:25:14.360
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a transient hawks.</v>

3166
02:25:14.361 --> 02:25:16.680
<v Speaker 1>We show them that show.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about that?</v>

3167
02:25:16.800 --> 02:25:21.440
<v Speaker 1>You want to get that motherfucker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>TheY actually catch tranche though.</v>

3168
02:25:22.070 --> 02:25:24.140
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do come home,</v>

3169
02:25:24.160 --> 02:25:25.150
<v Speaker 5>man.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What a monster.</v>

3170
02:25:25.370 --> 02:25:27.250
<v Speaker 5>Flying monster.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm peeing out of my dick.</v>

3171
02:25:27.251 --> 02:25:28.210
<v Speaker 5>I'm like pointed.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Go ahead.</v>

3172
02:25:28.330 --> 02:25:31.300
<v Speaker 5>My point is that if we eliminated that </v>
<v Speaker 5>from the world,</v>

3173
02:25:31.480 --> 02:25:34.960
<v Speaker 5>it was just an era and everyone left had</v>
<v Speaker 5>to figure things out.</v>

3174
02:25:35.290 --> 02:25:40.290
<v Speaker 5>I think magically 99 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world's problems would immediately be </v>

3175
02:25:40.361 --> 02:25:42.250
<v Speaker 5>eradicated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I really do believe that.</v>

3176
02:25:42.430 --> 02:25:47.430
<v Speaker 5>I think most of the world's problems,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whether it's crazy out of control </v>

3177
02:25:47.430 --> 02:25:51.421
<v Speaker 5>bankers that are fucking stealing </v>
<v Speaker 5>resources and robbing the country blind </v>

3178
02:25:51.421 --> 02:25:54.720
<v Speaker 5>or whether it's evil corrupt politicians</v>
<v Speaker 5>or whether it's you know,</v>

3179
02:25:54.730 --> 02:25:56.960
<v Speaker 5>whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you get caught,</v>

3180
02:25:57.550 --> 02:26:02.550
<v Speaker 5>all the county human beings out of that </v>
<v Speaker 5>equation and new resolutions </v>

3181
02:26:02.591 --> 02:26:06.370
<v Speaker 5>automatically begin to show themselves </v>
<v Speaker 5>and people automatically begin to try to</v>

3182
02:26:06.580 --> 02:26:11.580
<v Speaker 5>find ways to work together and stop a </v>
<v Speaker 5>environmental devastation and figure out</v>

3183
02:26:12.130 --> 02:26:14.080
<v Speaker 5>how to be profitable while still being </v>
<v Speaker 5>ethical.</v>

3184
02:26:14.220 --> 02:26:19.220
<v Speaker 5>It's an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We have like this huge civilization </v>

3185
02:26:19.220 --> 02:26:22.600
<v Speaker 5>issue that's really a contest shoe,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if you ask them all the line up,</v>

3186
02:26:22.630 --> 02:26:24.490
<v Speaker 5>you won't have people who self identify.</v>

3187
02:26:24.560 --> 02:26:29.560
<v Speaker 5>Of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you need a really good court system </v>

3188
02:26:29.560 --> 02:26:30.010
<v Speaker 5>or mushrooms.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mushrooms would help.</v>

3189
02:26:30.430 --> 02:26:35.430
<v Speaker 5>You know when people need to do is that </v>
<v Speaker 5>your ego can convince you from some </v>

3190
02:26:35.430 --> 02:26:36.490
<v Speaker 5>pretty horrible shit because we're in </v>
<v Speaker 5>this.</v>

3191
02:26:36.860 --> 02:26:41.860
<v Speaker 5>We're,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're sort of a species that's in a </v>

3192
02:26:41.860 --> 02:26:43.921
<v Speaker 5>stage.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We're in a stage of not quite being </v>

3193
02:26:43.921 --> 02:26:43.921
<v Speaker 5>animals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>being self aware,</v>

3194
02:26:43.921 --> 02:26:47.410
<v Speaker 5>having the ability to communicate,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but not really being completely,</v>

3195
02:26:47.411 --> 02:26:48.910
<v Speaker 5>fully,</v>
<v Speaker 5>wholly enlightened,</v>

3196
02:26:48.911 --> 02:26:53.911
<v Speaker 5>and there's a lot of things that slow us</v>
<v Speaker 5>down along that way to being completely </v>

3197
02:26:53.911 --> 02:26:57.451
<v Speaker 5>wholly enlightened and enjoying this </v>
<v Speaker 5>experience as brothers and sisters.</v>

3198
02:26:57.790 --> 02:27:00.550
<v Speaker 5>And the problem is people that don't get</v>
<v Speaker 5>life right,</v>

3199
02:27:00.820 --> 02:27:05.820
<v Speaker 5>whether it's genetic or whether it's </v>
<v Speaker 5>behavioral because of their environment </v>

3200
02:27:05.820 --> 02:27:07.300
<v Speaker 5>and the conditioning that theY </v>
<v Speaker 5>experienced growing up.</v>

3201
02:27:07.390 --> 02:27:12.390
<v Speaker 5>Whatever it is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>those people that don't quite get life </v>

3202
02:27:12.390 --> 02:27:15.091
<v Speaker 5>right and they're just fucking insulting</v>
<v Speaker 5>and stupid and annoying and constantly </v>

3203
02:27:15.091 --> 02:27:19.711
<v Speaker 5>creating their own issue is constantly </v>
<v Speaker 5>causing problems so that they have some </v>

3204
02:27:19.711 --> 02:27:21.190
<v Speaker 5>sort of motivation to get through their </v>
<v Speaker 5>daily day.</v>

3205
02:27:21.210 --> 02:27:23.380
<v Speaker 5>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that's a big percentage of human beings.</v>

3206
02:27:23.680 --> 02:27:26.830
<v Speaker 5>It's a complex organism that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>come with a direction manual,</v>

3207
02:27:26.980 --> 02:27:31.980
<v Speaker 5>so a lot of people fuck it up and You </v>
<v Speaker 5>develop from the ground up and you do a </v>

3208
02:27:31.980 --> 02:27:36.001
<v Speaker 5>shit job and it's addicted to drugs and </v>
<v Speaker 5>it's stopping that with these drugs and </v>

3209
02:27:36.221 --> 02:27:39.280
<v Speaker 5>you're filling these holes and you're.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're cutting up.</v>

3210
02:27:39.610 --> 02:27:43.870
<v Speaker 5>You got to have something that allows </v>
<v Speaker 5>you to see if it's possible.</v>

3211
02:27:43.871 --> 02:27:44.920
<v Speaker 5>Some people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's not possible.</v>

3212
02:27:44.921 --> 02:27:49.921
<v Speaker 5>Some people are so psychologically </v>
<v Speaker 5>damaged by the time they've come in </v>

3213
02:27:49.921 --> 02:27:52.201
<v Speaker 5>adult.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's almost nothing you can do for </v>

3214
02:27:52.201 --> 02:27:54.091
<v Speaker 5>them,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but if someone did have enough sense to </v>

3215
02:27:54.091 --> 02:27:58.711
<v Speaker 5>just stand back and look at their life </v>
<v Speaker 5>as if they were trying to give </v>

3216
02:27:58.711 --> 02:27:58.960
<v Speaker 5>themselves advice,</v>
<v Speaker 5>like if you.</v>

3217
02:27:58.961 --> 02:28:00.730
<v Speaker 5>If you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>How would you give yourself advice?</v>

3218
02:28:00.760 --> 02:28:03.130
<v Speaker 5>Have you met you and you saw your </v>
<v Speaker 5>issues?</v>

3219
02:28:03.131 --> 02:28:05.590
<v Speaker 5>What would you say?</v>
<v Speaker 5>If I give myself advice,</v>

3220
02:28:05.740 --> 02:28:07.210
<v Speaker 5>it's a great move.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You know,</v>

3221
02:28:07.230 --> 02:28:08.740
<v Speaker 5>that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

3222
02:28:08.770 --> 02:28:13.480
<v Speaker 5>I think it comes from a move.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think some of it comes also from.</v>

3223
02:28:14.660 --> 02:28:16.810
<v Speaker 5>There's something that a human being </v>
<v Speaker 5>like,</v>

3224
02:28:16.960 --> 02:28:19.150
<v Speaker 5>like somebody wants that the scientists </v>
<v Speaker 5>were saying,</v>

3225
02:28:19.390 --> 02:28:21.470
<v Speaker 5>if you got rid of all the ants on </v>
<v Speaker 5>planet,</v>

3226
02:28:21.650 --> 02:28:22.070
<v Speaker 5>the earth</v>

3227
02:28:22.070 --> 02:28:24.260
<v Speaker 1>would last five years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

3228
02:28:24.290 --> 02:28:29.290
<v Speaker 1>all the other animals would die in five </v>
<v Speaker 1>years for a whole bunch of reasons </v>

3229
02:28:29.290 --> 02:28:30.080
<v Speaker 1>because it's part of the ecosystem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you got rid of all humans,</v>

3230
02:28:30.890 --> 02:28:32.870
<v Speaker 1>animals and everything else would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>just fine.</v>

3231
02:28:32.871 --> 02:28:34.130
<v Speaker 1>It would flourish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

3232
02:28:34.940 --> 02:28:39.940
<v Speaker 1>that is an interesting thing to say.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought about that because I thought </v>

3233
02:28:39.940 --> 02:28:40.130
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

3234
02:28:40.160 --> 02:28:45.160
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people when you couch it in </v>

3235
02:28:45.160 --> 02:28:45.170
<v Speaker 1>those terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I think as a human being,</v>

3236
02:28:45.171 --> 02:28:50.171
<v Speaker 1>you kind of grew up knowing in some ways</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we are somehow a burden to the </v>

3237
02:28:50.361 --> 02:28:51.590
<v Speaker 1>ecosystem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

3238
02:28:51.740 --> 02:28:54.890
<v Speaker 1>we are a burden to this world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the natural world,</v>

3239
02:28:54.891 --> 02:28:56.840
<v Speaker 1>and it's something we have to steward </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly.</v>

3240
02:28:57.470 --> 02:29:02.470
<v Speaker 1>That kind of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a built in sense as a human </v>

3241
02:29:02.470 --> 02:29:05.650
<v Speaker 1>being that in some ways you are a bit of</v>
<v Speaker 1>an intruder and interruption and a and a</v>

3242
02:29:05.720 --> 02:29:10.720
<v Speaker 1>burden to that which is life sustaining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always think even now that's so </v>

3243
02:29:12.620 --> 02:29:13.220
<v Speaker 1>personal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

3244
02:29:13.221 --> 02:29:15.710
<v Speaker 1>I don't agree with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not saying that I agree.</v>

3245
02:29:15.711 --> 02:29:18.950
<v Speaker 1>I'm just saying I think that is part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the human psyche and always has been.</v>

3246
02:29:19.380 --> 02:29:21.200
<v Speaker 1>I think so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think especially,</v>

3247
02:29:21.940 --> 02:29:25.160
<v Speaker 1>I think that's where conservation </v>
<v Speaker 1>movements and speed and things come from</v>

3248
02:29:25.450 --> 02:29:28.490
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I disagree with you to pull yourself out</v>

3249
02:29:28.491 --> 02:29:28.820
<v Speaker 1>of the hole.</v>

3250
02:29:30.240 --> 02:29:32.060
<v Speaker 4>Did you hear about this?</v>
<v Speaker 4>The newton,</v>

3251
02:29:32.120 --> 02:29:33.570
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>families from the,</v>

3252
02:29:33.610 --> 02:29:35.930
<v Speaker 4>the victims of the school shooting?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3253
02:29:36.010 --> 02:29:38.780
<v Speaker 4>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we're in the last mile of the,</v>

3254
02:29:38.860 --> 02:29:43.860
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it was dedicated to the last mile was </v>

3255
02:29:43.860 --> 02:29:45.791
<v Speaker 4>dedicated to them,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's where they were all sitting </v>

3256
02:29:45.791 --> 02:29:45.791
<v Speaker 4>and that's where all the bombs went off.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

3257
02:29:46.050 --> 02:29:51.050
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>so that's a conspiracy going on one of </v>

3258
02:29:51.050 --> 02:29:51.050
<v Speaker 4>those individuals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>um,</v>

3259
02:29:51.050 --> 02:29:52.840
<v Speaker 4>in june.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3260
02:29:53.210 --> 02:29:56.260
<v Speaker 4>I'm not sure because they're not saying </v>
<v Speaker 4>who's been there,</v>

3261
02:29:57.310 --> 02:29:59.110
<v Speaker 1>just they haven't suffered enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man.</v>

3262
02:29:59.111 --> 02:30:00.850
<v Speaker 1>I got kids that age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3263
02:30:01.090 --> 02:30:02.860
<v Speaker 4>And that's something that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

3264
02:30:03.670 --> 02:30:05.340
<v Speaker 4>I guess that would have been public </v>
<v Speaker 4>information.</v>

3265
02:30:05.341 --> 02:30:07.660
<v Speaker 4>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Where those people were.</v>

3266
02:30:07.680 --> 02:30:08.150
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>because they,</v>

3267
02:30:08.170 --> 02:30:09.220
<v Speaker 4>I guess they,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they,</v>

3268
02:30:09.250 --> 02:30:10.040
<v Speaker 4>it actually,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's,</v>

<v Speaker 4>it,</v>

3271
02:30:15.191 --> 02:30:18.130
<v Speaker 4>but there's actually people taking </v>
<v Speaker 4>photos in front of it,</v>

3272
02:30:18.160 --> 02:30:20.290
<v Speaker 4>like the families and stuff like that </v>
<v Speaker 4>before it happened.</v>

3273
02:30:22.200 --> 02:30:23.830
<v Speaker 6>So weird.</v>

<v Speaker 1>that was one of the most satisfied </v>

3281

<v Speaker 1>pisses I've ever had my life.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What is that?</v>

3283
02:30:51.690 --> 02:30:56.690
<v Speaker 4>The school shooters were sitting in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>last mile of the boston marathon from </v>

3284
02:30:56.690 --> 02:30:57.860
<v Speaker 4>newton.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Oh my god.</v>

3285
02:30:58.280 --> 02:31:00.650
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And so did they get hurt?</v>

3286
02:31:01.290 --> 02:31:06.290
<v Speaker 4>Probably,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but they haven't said he's gotten hurt </v>

3287
02:31:06.290 --> 02:31:06.290
<v Speaker 4>though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So that's what they were.</v>

3288
02:31:06.290 --> 02:31:07.640
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something soccer.</v>

3289
02:31:08.510 --> 02:31:10.940
<v Speaker 1>What the fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This whole thing is terrifying.</v>

3290
02:31:10.941 --> 02:31:12.440
<v Speaker 1>Cnn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't go to cnn.</v>

3291
02:31:12.441 --> 02:31:13.600
<v Speaker 1>Fox don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't,</v>

3292
02:31:13.670 --> 02:31:17.870
<v Speaker 1>don't even go look at the front page.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's horrific blood everywhere.</v>

3293
02:31:18.690 --> 02:31:21.380
<v Speaker 1>It's of problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a con providence current problem.</v>

3294
02:31:21.430 --> 02:31:26.430
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's obviously that </v>

3295
02:31:26.430 --> 02:31:26.670
<v Speaker 1>simplifying things to the extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't send me twitter messages.</v>

3296
02:31:26.671 --> 02:31:29.340
<v Speaker 1>I know what I'm doing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're saying.</v>

3297
02:31:29.341 --> 02:31:30.930
<v Speaker 1>You're absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I agree with you,</v>

3298
02:31:30.931 --> 02:31:35.520
<v Speaker 1>but that's obviously missing the point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3299
02:31:36.840 --> 02:31:38.700
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>human human beings,</v>

3300
02:31:38.701 --> 02:31:41.490
<v Speaker 1>man is capable of amazing shit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

3301
02:31:41.880 --> 02:31:46.200
<v Speaker 1>I've definitely said that like we could </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out how to get people to everyone</v>

3302
02:31:46.201 --> 02:31:48.480
<v Speaker 1>get their shit together and that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bipolar rape.</v>

3303
02:31:48.540 --> 02:31:50.250
<v Speaker 1>We are the most bipolar rape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

3304
02:31:50.251 --> 02:31:52.080
<v Speaker 1>But I don't think it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's important.</v>

3305
02:31:52.260 --> 02:31:57.260
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think it's necessary for our </v>

3306
02:31:57.260 --> 02:31:57.930
<v Speaker 1>survival.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we have to be shitty to,</v>

3307
02:31:57.960 --> 02:31:59.550
<v Speaker 1>to in order to move forward.</v>

3308
02:31:59.550 --> 02:32:01.990
<v Speaker 1>I agree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the right date.</v>

3309
02:32:02.640 --> 02:32:04.620
<v Speaker 1>Didn't have technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that's the case.</v>

3310
02:32:05.120 --> 02:32:10.120
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like the when one of the things </v>

3311
02:32:10.120 --> 02:32:11.841
<v Speaker 1>that I put in it puts it into </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective that a couple of thousand </v>

3312
02:32:11.841 --> 02:32:12.390
<v Speaker 1>years ago if someone showed up on your </v>
<v Speaker 1>shore,</v>

3313
02:32:12.750 --> 02:32:15.270
<v Speaker 1>those fucking people were dangerous and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you had to kill them.</v>

3314
02:32:15.560 --> 02:32:20.560
<v Speaker 1>We're probably going to get raped and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pillaged and sold into slavery and now </v>

3315
02:32:20.560 --> 02:32:21.600
<v Speaker 1>you welcomed them as an important part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the tourism industry.</v>

3316
02:32:21.680 --> 02:32:26.680
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a completely new development in </v>

3317
02:32:26.680 --> 02:32:29.841
<v Speaker 1>human history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>have fucking rosetta stone so you can </v>

3318
02:32:29.841 --> 02:32:29.841
<v Speaker 1>figure out what the hell they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying.</v>

3319
02:32:29.841 --> 02:32:30.510
<v Speaker 1>It's so true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3320
02:32:30.560 --> 02:32:35.070
<v Speaker 1>that's so much of the world and up until</v>
<v Speaker 1>literally 300 years ago,</v>

3321
02:32:35.071 --> 02:32:37.230
<v Speaker 1>less less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what am I talking about?</v>

3322
02:32:37.890 --> 02:32:42.890
<v Speaker 1>One hundred 50 years ago was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>servitude of some kind and usually a </v>

3323
02:32:42.890 --> 02:32:42.890
<v Speaker 1>form of slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3324
02:32:42.890 --> 02:32:47.530
<v Speaker 1>what's really trippy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's to see North Korea still rocking </v>

3325
02:32:47.530 --> 02:32:47.530
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>old school today,</v>

3326
02:32:47.530 --> 02:32:48.890
<v Speaker 1>still rocking a full.</v>

3327
02:32:50.600 --> 02:32:52.010
<v Speaker 4>I can't figure out what's going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>happen.</v>

3328
02:32:52.040 --> 02:32:57.040
<v Speaker 4>I mean like in some way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in some way it seems that the state </v>

3329
02:32:58.371 --> 02:33:01.170
<v Speaker 4>department and in the military is like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh my,</v>

3330
02:33:02.120 --> 02:33:04.480
<v Speaker 4>like what do you do with these guys?</v>
<v Speaker 4>And their hand.</v>

3331
02:33:04.500 --> 02:33:06.200
<v Speaker 4>Then the other half of it seems like a </v>
<v Speaker 4>car,</v>

3332
02:33:06.230 --> 02:33:06.680
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>
<v Speaker 4>like,</v>

3333
02:33:06.681 --> 02:33:07.630
<v Speaker 4>seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can't tell it.</v>

3334
02:33:07.650 --> 02:33:09.410
<v Speaker 4>Is it not serious or serious?</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

3335
02:33:09.411 --> 02:33:10.840
<v Speaker 4>it's blessed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Flustered.</v>

3336
02:33:10.940 --> 02:33:12.470
<v Speaker 4>North korea's always busted.</v>
<v Speaker 4>However,</v>

3337
02:33:12.471 --> 02:33:14.020
<v Speaker 4>the problem is this kid is</v>

3338
02:33:14.130 --> 02:33:15.630
<v Speaker 1>29,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe 30.</v>

3339
02:33:16.350 --> 02:33:21.350
<v Speaker 1>They don't know a lot about them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not talking about the ruler of </v>

3340
02:33:21.350 --> 02:33:22.410
<v Speaker 1>North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sun john il now or whatever.</v>

3341
02:33:22.411 --> 02:33:24.400
<v Speaker 1>I think his name is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't.</v>

3342
02:33:24.430 --> 02:33:25.980
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't know enough about him.</v>

3343
02:33:26.010 --> 02:33:27.720
<v Speaker 1>And uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it used to be his father.</v>

3344
02:33:27.721 --> 02:33:29.400
<v Speaker 1>There was a method to his father's </v>
<v Speaker 1>madness.</v>

3345
02:33:29.580 --> 02:33:32.040
<v Speaker 1>He would create a lot of heat to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrinkled,</v>

3346
02:33:32.280 --> 02:33:34.110
<v Speaker 1>negotiating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tam will get more aid or whatever.</v>

3347
02:33:34.470 --> 02:33:39.470
<v Speaker 1>And this kid is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they think probably rattling his sword </v>

3348
02:33:39.470 --> 02:33:43.011
<v Speaker 1>to get the respect of the ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>generals that actually run that fucking </v>

02:33:43.011 --> 02:33:44.700
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

<v Speaker 1>That is.</v>

3352
02:33:50.420 --> 02:33:52.560
<v Speaker 1>What did you think of North Korea when </v>
<v Speaker 1>you have desk robin and your counsel,</v>

<v Speaker 1>2007 and it's this particular vineyard,</v>

<v Speaker 1>He knows he's a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a legit wine kind of.</v>

3448
02:38:08.540 --> 02:38:13.540
<v Speaker 1>I went to his birthday party and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>had this really nutty dinner where they </v>

3449
02:38:13.540 --> 02:38:14.730
<v Speaker 1>gave what they call flights of wine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That stuff.</v>

3450
02:38:15.220 --> 02:38:20.220
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they were all like drinking it and </v>

3451
02:38:20.220 --> 02:38:20.720
<v Speaker 1>describing the earthy tones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this one is oak and this one.</v>

3452
02:38:20.780 --> 02:38:22.430
<v Speaker 1>That's my favorite thing to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll do that all day.</v>

3453
02:38:23.760 --> 02:38:25.370
<v Speaker 1>I will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I will do,</v>

3454
02:38:25.400 --> 02:38:27.530
<v Speaker 1>I'll sit there and I love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretend I.</v>

3455
02:38:27.531 --> 02:38:28.760
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll wear it.</v>

3456
02:38:28.970 --> 02:38:31.070
<v Speaker 1>I'll wear a tweed jacket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll wear a scarf.</v>

3457
02:38:31.100 --> 02:38:32.630
<v Speaker 1>You wear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would definitely wear a scarf.</v>

3458
02:38:32.750 --> 02:38:34.920
<v Speaker 8>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 8>When I'm bringing up is the vertical.</v>

3459
02:38:34.960 --> 02:38:36.870
<v Speaker 8>there's a vertical and the horizontal </v>
<v Speaker 8>flight,</v>

3460
02:38:37.170 --> 02:38:38.250
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>
<v Speaker 8>I don't know.</v>

3461
02:38:38.290 --> 02:38:43.290
<v Speaker 8>Vertical flight would be a horizontal </v>
<v Speaker 8>flight would be where you take a year </v>

3462
02:38:43.770 --> 02:38:47.610
<v Speaker 8>and you go into like all the,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like all the great bordeauxs and you get</v>

3463
02:38:47.670 --> 02:38:51.810
<v Speaker 8>their bordeaux from that year is a </v>
<v Speaker 8>horizontal flight,</v>

3464
02:38:51.860 --> 02:38:56.860
<v Speaker 8>a vertical flight is you take a specific</v>
<v Speaker 8>vineyard and you collect all the years </v>

3465
02:38:58.921 --> 02:39:03.921
<v Speaker 8>from that specific vineyard,</v>
<v Speaker 8>so you might host a vertical and it's </v>

3466
02:39:03.921 --> 02:39:05.850
<v Speaker 8>like chateau whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 8>19,</v>

3467
02:39:05.851 --> 02:39:10.440
<v Speaker 8>20 to 1945 and you're going to taste a </v>
<v Speaker 8>25 year span out of that.</v>

3468
02:39:11.010 --> 02:39:16.010
<v Speaker 8>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Right now I'm in the reason I know this </v>

3469
02:39:16.010 --> 02:39:18.820
<v Speaker 8>and I want to do a shameless plug.</v>
<v Speaker 8>My buddy ben wallace has this great </v>

3470
02:39:18.820 --> 02:39:19.170
<v Speaker 8>book,</v>
<v Speaker 8>the billionaire's vinegar and it's about</v>

3471
02:39:19.800 --> 02:39:21.630
<v Speaker 8>the most expensive bottle of wine ever </v>
<v Speaker 8>sold,</v>

3472
02:39:21.631 --> 02:39:24.690
<v Speaker 8>but like what is good wine?</v>
<v Speaker 8>Do we know good wine when we taste?</v>

3473
02:39:25.030 --> 02:39:25.920
<v Speaker 8>It's fascinating.</v>

3474
02:39:26.010 --> 02:39:27.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get really old shit,</v>

3475
02:39:27.900 --> 02:39:29.740
<v Speaker 1>most likely it's not good anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

3476
02:39:29.820 --> 02:39:34.710
<v Speaker 8>The problem is as his book explains is </v>
<v Speaker 8>the problem is no one.</v>

3477
02:39:34.740 --> 02:39:37.020
<v Speaker 8>This is a bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The most immense bottled wine ever sold.</v>

3478
02:39:37.050 --> 02:39:42.050
<v Speaker 8>Why don't be in fraudulent,</v>
<v Speaker 8>but it was purported to be owned by </v>

3479
02:39:42.050 --> 02:39:42.050
<v Speaker 8>Thomas Jefferson.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

3480
02:39:42.050 --> 02:39:46.340
<v Speaker 8>So for like steve forbes zoned it for </v>
<v Speaker 8>awhile and all these different guys on </v>

3481
02:39:46.340 --> 02:39:50.001
<v Speaker 8>this bottle of wine,</v>
<v Speaker 8>one of the koch brothers don't want it </v>

3482
02:39:50.001 --> 02:39:51.690
<v Speaker 8>for a while and in the end there's no </v>
<v Speaker 8>one around who can go.</v>

3483
02:39:51.720 --> 02:39:54.580
<v Speaker 8>I've had a lot of wine from that year,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right?</v>

3484
02:39:55.680 --> 02:40:00.680
<v Speaker 1>That's right on the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't it crazy though that these </v>

3485
02:40:00.871 --> 02:40:03.990
<v Speaker 1>different rich guys had the wine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sold it to each other.</v>

3486
02:40:03.991 --> 02:40:06.680
<v Speaker 1>Like they passed it off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The</v>

3487
02:40:06.790 --> 02:40:11.790
<v Speaker 8>forbes stored in a.</v>
<v Speaker 8>They put it in a in their corporate </v>

3488
02:40:11.790 --> 02:40:14.300
<v Speaker 8>headquarters and they had an a box,</v>
<v Speaker 8>like a glass boxes of decoration,</v>

3489
02:40:14.310 --> 02:40:19.310
<v Speaker 8>but they had standing upright with a </v>
<v Speaker 8>heat lamp in there laying dried that </v>

3490
02:40:19.310 --> 02:40:23.871
<v Speaker 8>cork out of the bottle.</v>
<v Speaker 8>So later when people were trying to </v>

3491
02:40:23.871 --> 02:40:28.251
<v Speaker 8>analyze what was in it,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there can never rule out the intrusion </v>

3492
02:40:28.410 --> 02:40:33.410
<v Speaker 8>of foreign substances,</v>
<v Speaker 8>which will not allow them to find out </v>

3493
02:40:33.410 --> 02:40:36.231
<v Speaker 8>what it was.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The guy that eventually like is why the </v>

3494
02:40:36.231 --> 02:40:39.110
<v Speaker 8>guy who created the hoax would take </v>
<v Speaker 8>really good wine and do weird stuff to </v>

3495
02:40:40.531 --> 02:40:45.531
<v Speaker 8>it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Like he put a little bit of vanilla </v>

3496
02:40:45.531 --> 02:40:47.060
<v Speaker 8>extract and air or he'd put some dirt </v>
<v Speaker 8>from his gutter and they're just weird </v>

3497
02:40:47.060 --> 02:40:51.531
<v Speaker 8>things he could do to kind of throw </v>
<v Speaker 8>people and then guys that are like big </v>

3498
02:40:51.531 --> 02:40:53.140
<v Speaker 8>swinging dicks about wine would taste </v>
<v Speaker 8>and be like,</v>

3499
02:40:53.141 --> 02:40:53.660
<v Speaker 8>oh yeah,</v>

3500
02:40:55.630 --> 02:40:57.780
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got it.</v>

3501
02:40:58.170 --> 02:41:03.170
<v Speaker 2>It's a brilliant book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I got invited by him</v>

3502
02:41:04.490 --> 02:41:05.600
<v Speaker 3>by a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by a popper,</v>

3503
02:41:05.700 --> 02:41:10.700
<v Speaker 3>a huge guy owned a paparazzi company and</v>
<v Speaker 3>he invited me to a wine tasting and he </v>

3504
02:41:10.700 --> 02:41:11.240
<v Speaker 3>said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he said,</v>

3505
02:41:11.300 --> 02:41:12.490
<v Speaker 3>and he goes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3506
02:41:12.510 --> 02:41:14.420
<v Speaker 3>I don't want.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can't really.</v>

3507
02:41:14.421 --> 02:41:15.600
<v Speaker 3>He was trying to be really nice </v>
<v Speaker 3>sneakers.</v>

3508
02:41:15.950 --> 02:41:17.630
<v Speaker 3>I'm going to bring one for my seller for</v>
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

3509
02:41:17.631 --> 02:41:18.190
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

3510
02:41:18.240 --> 02:41:21.080
<v Speaker 3>He whining,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to be a dick to you,</v>

3511
02:41:21.081 --> 02:41:23.540
<v Speaker 3>but you can't afford the wines were </v>
<v Speaker 3>going to bring.</v>

3512
02:41:23.870 --> 02:41:24.850
<v Speaker 3>And I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all right,</v>

3513
02:41:25.120 --> 02:41:26.980
<v Speaker 3>jeez.</v>
<v Speaker 3>How much was the most expensive?</v>

3514
02:41:27.330 --> 02:41:30.140
<v Speaker 3>like literally I was doing in 1961 stony</v>
<v Speaker 3>hills.</v>

3515
02:41:30.141 --> 02:41:32.480
<v Speaker 3>I mean I was drinking like wines that </v>
<v Speaker 3>you would cost,</v>

3516
02:41:32.510 --> 02:41:35.460
<v Speaker 3>costs you a thousand dollars to drink </v>
<v Speaker 3>either.</v>

3517
02:41:35.530 --> 02:41:37.430
<v Speaker 3>The taster for zach,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's wine.</v>

3518
02:41:37.431 --> 02:41:40.130
<v Speaker 3>The guy who sets the standard was there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So anyway,</v>

3519
02:41:40.131 --> 02:41:41.070
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I do,</v>

3520
02:41:41.071 --> 02:41:43.340
<v Speaker 3>I go there and I'm drinking crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nineteen,</v>

<v Speaker 3>60,</v>
<v Speaker 3>19,</v>

3522
02:41:44.121 --> 02:41:45.420
<v Speaker 3>63.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nineteen is like,</v>

3523
02:41:45.660 --> 02:41:46.700
<v Speaker 3>what is it like?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

3524
02:41:46.701 --> 02:41:48.200
<v Speaker 3>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I love wine so much,</v>

3525
02:41:48.201 --> 02:41:50.600
<v Speaker 3>there is a difference now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now here's the thing,</v>

3526
02:41:50.840 --> 02:41:54.050
<v Speaker 3>if you spend $300 on a bottle of wine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a big difference.</v>

3527
02:41:54.051 --> 02:41:58.160
<v Speaker 3>You're going to taste an amazing wine if</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know what to get versus a $50 bottle</v>

3528
02:41:58.161 --> 02:41:58.970
<v Speaker 3>of wine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

3529
02:41:59.480 --> 02:42:01.850
<v Speaker 3>the difference between $300 and a </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousand dollars,</v>

3530
02:42:01.910 --> 02:42:05.330
<v Speaker 3>I don't think there's no difference.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now you're talking about scarcity.</v>

3531
02:42:05.360 --> 02:42:10.360
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>now you're going into like years and </v>

3532
02:42:10.360 --> 02:42:10.360
<v Speaker 3>there's one left and stuff.</v>

3533
02:42:10.360 --> 02:42:11.030
<v Speaker 8>I want to back up though because I want </v>
<v Speaker 8>to clarify.</v>

3534
02:42:11.240 --> 02:42:14.180
<v Speaker 8>It's too easy to hack on one kind of </v>
<v Speaker 8>sewers.</v>

3535
02:42:14.900 --> 02:42:16.280
<v Speaker 8>I want.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I do want to say this,</v>

3536
02:42:17.630 --> 02:42:22.630
<v Speaker 8>the handful of times someone did present</v>
<v Speaker 8>to me what's like critically regarded as</v>

3537
02:42:23.421 --> 02:42:26.570
<v Speaker 8>a good one.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I was able to taste that one and say,</v>

3538
02:42:27.500 --> 02:42:31.310
<v Speaker 8>I get what you're saying.</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's something going on here that was</v>

3539
02:42:31.311 --> 02:42:36.311
<v Speaker 8>not going on.</v>
<v Speaker 8>And all the other one I've had my whole </v>

3540
02:42:36.311 --> 02:42:36.320
<v Speaker 8>life,</v>
<v Speaker 8>it's wasted on me.</v>

3541
02:42:37.470 --> 02:42:39.760
<v Speaker 2>It's always something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I recognize what you're saying,</v>

3542
02:42:39.761 --> 02:42:42.700
<v Speaker 2>there's something going on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I don't want to act like it's all.</v>

3543
02:42:42.701 --> 02:42:43.960
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's all smoke and </v>
<v Speaker 2>mirrors.</v>

3544
02:42:43.961 --> 02:42:46.700
<v Speaker 2>It's not all bs at all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all bs.</v>

3545
02:42:46.750 --> 02:42:48.530
<v Speaker 2>And it's amazing the subtle differences </v>
<v Speaker 2>in,</v>

3546
02:42:48.580 --> 02:42:50.330
<v Speaker 2>in different glass one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

3547
02:42:50.340 --> 02:42:51.810
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I always equate it to this.</v>

3548
02:42:51.811 --> 02:42:53.910
<v Speaker 3>Like if I drink,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'd amazing bottle of wine,</v>

3549
02:42:54.180 --> 02:42:59.180
<v Speaker 3>like say 500 or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like my friend made a fortunate that </v>

3550
02:42:59.180 --> 02:42:59.180
<v Speaker 3>he's huge wine guy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Like your buddy.</v>

3551
02:42:59.180 --> 02:43:03.920
<v Speaker 3>I always describe it this way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I go when I drink an amazing glass of </v>

3552
02:43:03.920 --> 02:43:03.920
<v Speaker 3>wine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I say to them,</v>

3553
02:43:03.920 --> 02:43:03.920
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>

3554
02:43:03.960 --> 02:43:05.820
<v Speaker 3>the way I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reason it's expensive,</v>

3555
02:43:05.821 --> 02:43:07.650
<v Speaker 3>I go,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nothing else tastes like that,</v>

3556
02:43:07.830 --> 02:43:09.450
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that taste,</v>

3557
02:43:09.480 --> 02:43:11.800
<v Speaker 3>that experience stands on its own.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't compete.</v>

3558
02:43:11.801 --> 02:43:12.180
<v Speaker 3>You go,</v>

3559
02:43:12.370 --> 02:43:13.480
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it tastes just like this.</v>

3560
02:43:13.481 --> 02:43:15.400
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it stands on its own.</v>

3561
02:43:15.520 --> 02:43:19.360
<v Speaker 1>It's so complex and it's an experience </v>
<v Speaker 1>for me.</v>

3562
02:43:19.361 --> 02:43:21.310
<v Speaker 1>I love it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had to choose though,</v>

3563
02:43:21.400 --> 02:43:26.400
<v Speaker 1>if you had to choose between like no </v>
<v Speaker 1>wine for the rest of your life or blend </v>

3564
02:43:26.861 --> 02:43:29.030
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you like?</v>

3565
02:43:29.050 --> 02:43:34.050
<v Speaker 1>What is more important?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The taste of food or to go 100 percent </v>

3566
02:43:34.050 --> 02:43:34.390
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can live without one.</v>

3567
02:43:34.391 --> 02:43:35.470
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

3568
02:43:35.471 --> 02:43:37.030
<v Speaker 1>I to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need one.</v>

3569
02:43:37.600 --> 02:43:38.080
<v Speaker 1>I like it.</v>

3570
02:43:38.160 --> 02:43:38.580
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3571
02:43:38.581 --> 02:43:41.190
<v Speaker 4>When I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When I'm eating very high quality.</v>

3572
02:43:41.191 --> 02:43:43.080
<v Speaker 4>Good food though.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I won't have again.</v>

3573
02:43:43.410 --> 02:43:46.650
<v Speaker 4>I typically I like to.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I like to eat it with water.</v>

3574
02:43:46.740 --> 02:43:47.040
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

3575
02:43:47.240 --> 02:43:47.740
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Me too.</v>

3576
02:43:48.440 --> 02:43:50.690
<v Speaker 1>Me too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes you have food that's so good.</v>

3577
02:43:50.720 --> 02:43:55.720
<v Speaker 1>like I was just just in Louisiana this </v>
<v Speaker 1>weekend and I went to this restaurant </v>

3578
02:43:55.720 --> 02:43:56.960
<v Speaker 1>called revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had a nokia lobster and yucky.</v>

3579
02:43:57.550 --> 02:43:58.590
<v Speaker 1>I don't like the way you say.</v>

3580
02:43:59.350 --> 02:44:04.350
<v Speaker 2>We say Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't like any of these endeavors.</v>

3581
02:44:05.410 --> 02:44:10.410
<v Speaker 2>Knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I had a crawfish crawfish given a nod</v>

3582
02:44:14.990 --> 02:44:16.130
<v Speaker 4>toward.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

3583
02:44:16.170 --> 02:44:16.670
<v Speaker 4>I like it.</v>

3584
02:44:16.930 --> 02:44:19.600
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not going to start doing.</v>

3585
02:44:19.601 --> 02:44:21.340
<v Speaker 2>But like you're kind of saying like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah man.</v>

3586
02:44:21.940 --> 02:44:24.640
<v Speaker 1>More to the earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's more to the globe.</v>

3587
02:44:24.970 --> 02:44:25.510
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

3588
02:44:25.680 --> 02:44:27.960
<v Speaker 2>I liked they're going to demonstrate </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

3589
02:44:27.961 --> 02:44:31.590
<v Speaker 2>but to me it's like the gold chains of </v>
<v Speaker 2>language.</v>

3590
02:44:31.860 --> 02:44:34.080
<v Speaker 2>He just showed up with a bunch of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fucking language.</v>

3591
02:44:34.081 --> 02:44:36.210
<v Speaker 2>Gold trades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was in Bahrain,</v>

3592
02:44:36.950 --> 02:44:41.670
<v Speaker 2>spend time in France.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I worked on in Afghanistan.</v>

3593
02:44:43.230 --> 02:44:45.870
<v Speaker 2>The taliban,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when I was visiting Chile,</v>

3594
02:44:46.270 --> 02:44:49.620
<v Speaker 2>we,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say it,</v>

3595
02:44:49.640 --> 02:44:53.320
<v Speaker 2>steve,</v>
<v Speaker 2>steve,</v>

3596
02:44:53.520 --> 02:44:53.820
<v Speaker 2>steve,</v>

3597
02:44:56.810 --> 02:44:59.700
<v Speaker 1>his family's had good rabbit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if really,</v>

3598
02:44:59.740 --> 02:45:04.740
<v Speaker 1>really good food is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is another thing that's transcendental </v>

3599
02:45:04.740 --> 02:45:04.740
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't need good wine,</v>

3600
02:45:04.740 --> 02:45:05.860
<v Speaker 1>but I do need good food.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know?</v>

3601
02:45:05.920 --> 02:45:09.610
<v Speaker 1>That's why when we were talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>your friend who doesn't like food,</v>

3602
02:45:09.611 --> 02:45:11.050
<v Speaker 1>I have a friend who's just like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>

3603
02:45:11.051 --> 02:45:12.220
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just want to.</v>

3604
02:45:12.230 --> 02:45:14.470
<v Speaker 1>I just want to eat and then get done and</v>
<v Speaker 1>then do my thing.</v>

3605
02:45:14.860 --> 02:45:15.610
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3606
02:45:15.611 --> 02:45:16.450

<v Speaker 1>I get it,</v>

3607
02:45:16.660 --> 02:45:19.450
<v Speaker 1>but maybe he's just tastes things </v>
<v Speaker 1>different than I do.</v>

3608
02:45:19.900 --> 02:45:24.900
<v Speaker 1>A dane cook has to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people like shit and other people </v>

3609
02:45:24.900 --> 02:45:26.530

3610
02:45:26.740 --> 02:45:31.740
<v Speaker 1>I think it tastes delicious too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've tried to give people sea </v>

<v Speaker 4>way.</v>

3622
02:45:50.210 --> 02:45:52.880
<v Speaker 2>I look at it differently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I look at it as I have the.</v>

<v Speaker 2>going to pay attention to support.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

<v Speaker 1>all the suffering people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to enjoy this meal.</v>

3628
02:46:01.450 --> 02:46:06.450
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as you're not victimizing </v>

3629
02:46:06.450 --> 02:46:06.450
<v Speaker 1>someone in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

3630
02:46:06.450 --> 02:46:06.730
<v Speaker 1>you're enjoying that food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should just be enjoying that food.</v>

3631
02:46:06.750 --> 02:46:09.920
<v Speaker 1>Enjoy that moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea that human beings have to be in</v>

3632
02:46:09.921 --> 02:46:14.180
<v Speaker 1>perspective of $6,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million other fucking people is so crazy</v>

3633
02:46:14.420 --> 02:46:19.420
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise you'll never be happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll never be happy because the world </v>

3634
02:46:19.420 --> 02:46:19.420
<v Speaker 1>is filled with suffering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

3635
02:46:19.420 --> 02:46:23.591
<v Speaker 1>there's just always tragic instances </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening all over the world where </v>

3636
02:46:23.591 --> 02:46:23.591
<v Speaker 1>people getting hit in the head by </v>
<v Speaker 1>coconuts,</v>

3637
02:46:23.591 --> 02:46:24.980
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should not be.</v>

3638
02:46:25.010 --> 02:46:27.170
<v Speaker 1>should not be eating and enjoying your </v>
<v Speaker 1>steak because some,</v>

3639
02:46:27.350 --> 02:46:32.350
<v Speaker 1>some poor farmer got hit in the head </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a coconut and fucking dog because </v>

3640
02:46:32.350 --> 02:46:32.350
<v Speaker 1>that shit happens 150 times a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

3641
02:46:32.350 --> 02:46:37.180
<v Speaker 1>and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what about the fact that are people </v>

3642
02:46:37.180 --> 02:46:39.791
<v Speaker 1>who can really cook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an art form to dedicate their </v>

3643

<v Speaker 1>life to it and it makes your life if </v>

3644
02:46:43.121 --> 02:46:43.121
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

3645
02:46:43.121 --> 02:46:47.080
<v Speaker 1>I want to live in a world with bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with bad food or food to where people </v>

<v Speaker 1>Do you'd rather live in that world,</v>

3647
02:46:49.280 --> 02:46:52.100
<v Speaker 1>the not being alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Someone said,</v>

<v Speaker 1>so I can have an arsenal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She could have an awesome.</v>

3653
02:47:02.090 --> 02:47:07.090
<v Speaker 1>You can have an arsenal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine what pigment and nugent </v>

3654
02:47:07.090 --> 02:47:09.340
<v Speaker 1>would do if we had good food in zombies </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this special on twitter the other </v>

3655
02:47:10.551 --> 02:47:15.551
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best show ever would be a </v>

3656
02:47:15.551 --> 02:47:15.551
<v Speaker 1>combination of the walking dead and duck</v>
<v Speaker 1>dynasty.</v>

3657
02:47:15.551 --> 02:47:18.760
<v Speaker 1>These dudes that go out to have theIr </v>
<v Speaker 1>fucking wacky stunts like pretending.</v>

3658
02:47:18.761 --> 02:47:20.420
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't open the door,</v>

3659
02:47:20.421 --> 02:47:25.421
<v Speaker 1>so I called bob up this fake scenario </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then all of a sudden they all get </v>

3660
02:47:25.421 --> 02:47:29.801
<v Speaker 1>eaten by zombies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just ripped that fucking throats out </v>

3661
02:47:29.801 --> 02:47:32.740
<v Speaker 1>as they're filming that shitty show and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they start their either beard.</v>

3662
02:47:32.810 --> 02:47:37.810
<v Speaker 1>I made their and brains mixed in with </v>
<v Speaker 1>beard and they're trying to choke it </v>

3663
02:47:38.901 --> 02:47:43.901
<v Speaker 1>down,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throwing up zombies throw up because </v>

3664
02:47:43.901 --> 02:47:44.860
<v Speaker 1>they can't eat their beard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No wonder one of the first time,</v>

3665
02:47:44.870 --> 02:47:45.470
<v Speaker 1>like one of the</v>

3666
02:47:45.790 --> 02:47:48.440
<v Speaker 8>tv meetings I ever had was years ago now</v>
<v Speaker 8>it was like,</v>

3667
02:47:48.550 --> 02:47:53.550
<v Speaker 8>I think it was 2004.</v>
<v Speaker 8>I had a tv meeting where a guy in an </v>

3668
02:47:53.550 --> 02:47:56.620
<v Speaker 8>assigned explained to me the most </v>
<v Speaker 8>brilliant show that he was doing,</v>

3669
02:47:56.621 --> 02:47:58.480
<v Speaker 8>but I don't think that ever happened and</v>
<v Speaker 8>it was going to be.</v>

3670
02:47:58.481 --> 02:48:02.620
<v Speaker 8>he was trying.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He was pitching around the show that was</v>

3671
02:48:02.621 --> 02:48:06.130
<v Speaker 8>going to be.</v>
<v Speaker 8>It was gonna start like a reality show.</v>

3672
02:48:06.140 --> 02:48:08.110
<v Speaker 8>We make our big live in a house.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Okay.</v>

3673
02:48:08.950 --> 02:48:13.950
<v Speaker 8>And you know,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you foment the typical like inner </v>

3674
02:48:13.950 --> 02:48:13.950
<v Speaker 8>personal conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 8>All right.</v>

3675
02:48:13.950 --> 02:48:18.720
<v Speaker 8>And as it would go on,</v>
<v Speaker 8>things would start getting so unusual.</v>

3676
02:48:19.720 --> 02:48:22.450
<v Speaker 8>He was already like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>right when reality tv was starting,</v>

3677
02:48:22.451 --> 02:48:27.451
<v Speaker 8>he was already.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He was already trying to think of what </v>

3678
02:48:27.451 --> 02:48:29.131
<v Speaker 8>he was ahead of his time.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He's already thinking like how to toy </v>

3679
02:48:29.131 --> 02:48:31.171
<v Speaker 8>with it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Then he wanted to have it get like </v>

3680
02:48:31.171 --> 02:48:33.390
<v Speaker 8>increasingly outrageous to build up </v>
<v Speaker 8>where people would say like there's no </v>

3681
02:48:33.390 --> 02:48:34.000
<v Speaker 8>way,</v>
<v Speaker 8>there's no way.</v>

3682
02:48:34.270 --> 02:48:36.490
<v Speaker 8>And he wanted to bring it to the point </v>
<v Speaker 8>where there was a murder,</v>

3683
02:48:37.060 --> 02:48:38.260
<v Speaker 8>whoa,</v>
<v Speaker 8>you know,</v>

3684
02:48:38.620 --> 02:48:41.740
<v Speaker 8>and then there'd be a murder and then </v>
<v Speaker 8>the people in the reality.</v>

3685
02:48:41.741 --> 02:48:46.741
<v Speaker 8>So it'd be trying to like hide the fact </v>
<v Speaker 8>that they killed one of the roommates </v>

3686
02:48:46.741 --> 02:48:48.730
<v Speaker 8>and they would make this very gradual </v>
<v Speaker 8>segue into drama.</v>

3687
02:48:48.820 --> 02:48:50.470
<v Speaker 8>And I was like,</v>
<v Speaker 8>that is the most genius thing,</v>

3688
02:48:50.830 --> 02:48:51.910
<v Speaker 8>but I don't think he ever.</v>

3689
02:48:52.570 --> 02:48:55.000
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was he trying for an actual real murder?</v>

3690
02:48:55.540 --> 02:48:55.800
<v Speaker 8>No,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

3691
02:48:55.830 --> 02:48:55.950
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>
<v Speaker 8>no,</v>

3692
02:48:55.960 --> 02:49:00.960
<v Speaker 8>no.</v>
<v Speaker 8>He was just going to do you going to </v>

3693
02:49:00.960 --> 02:49:00.960
<v Speaker 8>fake it.</v>
<v Speaker 8>A scripted reality.</v>

3694
02:49:00.960 --> 02:49:01.420
<v Speaker 8>He's got the script that like a reality </v>
<v Speaker 8>show.</v>

3695
02:49:01.480 --> 02:49:05.680
<v Speaker 8>The viewers would like.</v>
<v Speaker 8>The viewers don't really understand that</v>

3696
02:49:05.681 --> 02:49:08.070
<v Speaker 8>reality shows are cast and scripted.</v>

3697
02:49:08.280 --> 02:49:11.040
<v Speaker 4>He was going to like toy with this idea </v>
<v Speaker 4>right when it was starting to happen.</v>

3698
02:49:11.041 --> 02:49:13.800
<v Speaker 4>Like real real world to mtv real world </v>
<v Speaker 4>type thing,</v>

3699
02:49:14.190 --> 02:49:19.190
<v Speaker 4>but build it in as he lost,</v>
<v Speaker 4>as he courted like in an incredulous </v>

3700
02:49:19.981 --> 02:49:21.840
<v Speaker 4>response.</v>
<v Speaker 4>And is viewership being like,</v>

3701
02:49:21.841 --> 02:49:23.490
<v Speaker 4>there's no way,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there's no way they didn't do that.</v>

3702
02:49:23.491 --> 02:49:28.491
<v Speaker 4>That didn't happen to like push it so </v>
<v Speaker 4>far that the final tipping point would </v>

3703
02:49:28.491 --> 02:49:31.170
<v Speaker 4>be they actually kill somebody in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>house,</v>

3704
02:49:31.200 --> 02:49:32.880
<v Speaker 4>but they don't really kill someone in </v>
<v Speaker 4>the house.</v>

3705
02:49:32.881 --> 02:49:35.730
<v Speaker 4>It's just that,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that point it jumped to being like,</v>

3706
02:49:36.150 --> 02:49:37.260
<v Speaker 4>we've been drawing.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

3710

<v Speaker 1>heard anything about beards.</v>

3711
02:49:49.040 --> 02:49:52.740
<v Speaker 1>They fade out and dress it up and beards</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they looked like zz top.</v>
