26
00:00:54.081 --> 00:00:55.550
<v Speaker 1>it's really not like,</v>

<v Speaker 1>well there'd be no more limitations on baseball bats.</v>

31
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:03.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

35
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.160
<v Speaker 1>but the tree is not the right size.</v>

36
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.850
<v Speaker 1>It's probably not one of those mini baseball bats they give out at the stadium</v>

37
00:01:13.851 --> 00:01:14.684
<v Speaker 1>and it's not a tree.</v>

38
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.330
<v Speaker 1>Somewhere in there is the right size.</v>

39
00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.213
<v Speaker 1>If,</v>

40

46
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.800
<v Speaker 1>This fucking bear is ridiculous.</v>

47
00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:33.810

<v Speaker 1>He's cute though,</v>

52
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.410
<v Speaker 1>but he's cool to cuddle with too.</v>

53
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.741
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

54
00:01:39.741 --> 00:01:41.750
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's a good pillow bed pillow thing.</v>

55
00:01:41.751 --> 00:01:42.584
<v Speaker 1>When you're gone,</v>

56
00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.290
<v Speaker 1>you're never home and she could just spin it.</v>

57
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.221
<v Speaker 1>That could,</v>

58
00:01:46.221 --> 00:01:46.680

<v Speaker 1>They actually do sell things for lonely bachelor's in Japan.</v>

60
00:01:50.211 --> 00:01:50.841
<v Speaker 1>It's like a,</v>

61
00:01:50.841 --> 00:01:51.740
<v Speaker 1>it was like a pillow,</v>

62
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.583
<v Speaker 1>like an arm.</v>

63
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.860
<v Speaker 1>I like reaches over it like it's holding onto.</v>

64
00:01:54.861 --> 00:01:56.120
<v Speaker 1>It's a very strange stuff.</v>

65
00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.830
<v Speaker 1>I wonder if you could wash this.</v>

66
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.823

<v Speaker 1>That's creepy.</v>

72
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.440
<v Speaker 1>If you want to sleep with a teddy bear,</v>

73
00:02:06.441 --> 00:02:08.780
<v Speaker 1>you can pretend a teddy bears its own individual thing.</v>

85
00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.280

86
00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.113

88
00:02:38.001 --> 00:02:40.390
<v Speaker 1>you got a hose that thing down then it smells like mold.</v>

89
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.930
<v Speaker 1>Can't hose that down.</v>

90
00:02:42.931 --> 00:02:43.900
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's waterproof.</v>

91
00:02:43.901 --> 00:02:44.580
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they're slick.</v>

92
00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.411
